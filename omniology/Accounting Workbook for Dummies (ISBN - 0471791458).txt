Accounting Workbook For Dummies 

Introduction
F
irst of all, I have to admit that accounting has an image problem. Be honest: What’s the
first thing that pops into your mind when you see the word “accountant”? You probably
think of a nerd wearing a green eyeshade who has the personality of an undertaker (no
offense meant to undertakers, of course). Well, I’ve never worn a green eyeshade in my life,
and I can assure you that I’m not a nerd. I own an iPod, I have a good sense of humor, and 
in addition to being an accounting professor for more than 40 years, I’ve also held several
administrative positions. But to be honest, I was somewhat of a nerd when I decided to go
into accounting. (I have pictures to prove it.)
I was a freshman at Iowa State University studying engineering but not liking it too well. On a
whim, I dropped into the student counseling office and took some tests. The result was that
they told me that I was a reasonably well-adjusted 18-year-old (little did they know), I had an
IQ sufficient for what they were about to recommend (but they never told me my IQ), and I
should switch to accounting. I was floored. Accounting? Well, I took the counselors’ advice
and changed my major to accounting, and I’ve never regretted it.
Explaining accounting for nonaccountants is one of my passions in life, and I’ve written sev-
eral books on the topic. About a decade ago, I had the opportunity to write Accounting For
Dummies (Wiley), which is now in its third edition. One of my other books is How To Read A
Financial Report (Wiley), which has been in print more than 25 years. This book, Accounting
Workbook For Dummies, fills a gap in my other books: They don’t have questions and exer-
cises. This book offers plenty of questions to test and improve your understanding of
accounting.
This book offers a different take on accounting — one that offers new insights and perspec-
tives. Having taught accounting for over 40 years, I have a pretty good idea of how the sub-
ject is taught. I don’t go out of my way to be contrary or confrontational, but accounting isn’t
an exact science. Accounting is full of controversy and differences of opinion. In this book, I
state my opinions forcefully and (I hope) clearly.
The spirit of this book is illustrated in two stories. One concerns the young and eager musi-
cian on her first trip to New York City, who gets off the train at Grand Central Terminal and
asks the first person she meets on the street: “How do you get to Carnegie Hall?” The answer
is: “Practice, practice, practice!” The second story concerns the legendary UCLA basketball
coach John Wooden. At the first practice of each year, he taught the players how to tie their
shoes so that they wouldn’t come loose during a game.
About This Book
Whether it’s a small mom and pop business or the gargantuan General Electric, every busi-
ness keeps track of its financial activities and its financial condition. You can’t run a business
without an accounting system that tells you whether you’re making a profit or suffering a loss,
whether you have enough cash to continue or your checking account balance is approaching
zero, and whether you’re in good financial shape or are on the edge of bankruptcy.

Accounting Workbook For Dummies is largely about business accounting. It explains how
business transactions are recorded in the accounts of a business and the financial state-
ments that are prepared for a business to report its profit and loss, financial condition,
and cash flows. It also explains how business managers use accounting information for
decision making. (The book doesn’t delve into business income taxation, which is the
province of professional accountants.)
Most business managers have limited accounting backgrounds, and most have their
enthusiasm for learning more about accounting well under control. But, down deep,
they’re likely to think that they should know more about accounting. Business man-
agers should find this book quite helpful even if they just dip their toes in.
If you’re a business bookkeeper or accountant, you can use this book to review the
topics you need to know well. It can help you upgrade your accounting skills and savvy
and lay the foundation for further advancement. One great thing about Accounting
Workbook For Dummies is that it offers alternative explanations of accounting topics
that are different from the explanations in standard accounting textbooks. The many
questions and problems (with clearly explained answers) offer an excellent way to test
your knowledge, and nobody knows your exam scores but you.
If you’re a student presently enrolled in a beginning accounting course, you can use
this book as a supplementary study guide to your textbook, one that offers many sup-
plementary questions and exercises. Perhaps you took an accounting course a few
years ago and need to brush up on the subject. This book can help you refresh your
understanding of accounting and help you recall things forgotten.
Foolish Assumptions
Mastering accounting is like mastering many subjects: First, you must understand the
lingo and the fundamentals. In accounting, you have to work problems to really get a
grasp of the topic and technique. Passive reading just isn’t enough. In writing this
book, I assumed that you aren’t a complete accounting neophyte. I designed the book
as a second step that builds on your basic accounting knowledge and experience. If
you have no previous exposure to accounting, you may want to consider first reading
Accounting For Dummies (Wiley).
You don’t have to be a math wizard to understanding accounting; basic high school
algebra is more than enough. However, you do have to pay attention to details, just as
you have to pay close attention to the words when you study Shakespeare. Accounting
involves calculations, and using a business/financial calculator is very helpful. In my
experience, many people don’t take the time to learn how to use their calculators. But
that’s time well spent. In many of the questions and problems posed throughout the
book, I explain how to use a business calculator for the solution.
How This Book Is Organized
Accounting Workbook For Dummies consists of four parts that cover topics including
recordkeeping basics, financial statements, accounting for business managers, and
investment accounting. I wrap it all up with some advice about financial statements
and tips for management accounting.
2
Accounting Workbook For Dummies 

Part I: Business Accounting Basics
The general theme of the chapters in this part is how an accountant records the trans-
actions of a business (its financial activities) in an accrual-basis accounting system
and how the effects of transactions are reported in the three primary financial state-
ments of a business — the income statement, the balance sheet, and the statement of
cash flows. This part also includes a review of the bookkeeping cycle, from recording
original entries through the adjusting and closing entries at year-end.
Part II: Preparing Financial Statements
This part examines the accounting issues and procedures involved in preparing the
three primary financial statements of a business. Compared with the standard text-
book approach to these topics, I put much more emphasis on the interconnections
between the three financial statements. The statements fit together like a tongue-and-
groove joint, and the chapters focus on these connections. This part closes with the
decisions every business must make in choosing which accounting methods to use for
recording profit.
Part III: Managerial, Manufacturing, 
and Capital Accounting
This part of the book examines how managers use accounting information when
making business decisions. In addition to financial statements, managers need profit
models for their decision-making analysis, and accountants should take the lead in
designing useful profit models for managers. This part also explains how the product
cost of manufactures is determined and the difficult accounting issues involved in
measuring product cost. The last chapter of this part discusses the accounting meas-
urement of interest and return on investment. Most people have a basic understanding
of interest and return on investment, but when it gets right down to a specific situa-
tion, they’re fuzzy on the details.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
Like all For Dummies books, Accounting Workbook For Dummies ends with a couple
chapters that provide tips to help you recall and apply important points sprinkled
throughout the book. The editors have decreed that there shall be ten of these tips in
each chapter. I provide two such chapters in this book — one being ten things you
should know about business financial statements, and one being a ten-point checklist
for management accountants.
Icons Used In This Book
Throughout this book, you can find useful “pointers” that save you the trouble of
buying a yellow highlighter pen and using sticky notes. These icons draw your atten-
tion to certain parts of the text. Think of them as road signs on your journey through
accounting.
3
Introduction

This icon marks the spot of an example question that explains and illustrates an impor-
tant point. The answer follows the question. It’s a good idea to make sure that you
understand the answer before attempting the additional questions on the topic. To get
the most out of the example questions, don’t read the answer right away. First, try to
answer the question, and then compare my answer with yours and how you got it.
This icon points out information that you probably would have underlined or high-
lighted while reading. These points are worth remembering. When reviewing each
chapter, read everything with this icon attached in order to get the essentials.
I use this icon to indicate that I’m building on your background in accounting. Instead
of starting at ground zero, I assume that you already know basic points about the
topic. If this book were an elevator, this marker would mean that you’re ascending
from the first floor to the second floor.
Simply put, this icon is a red flag that means “Watch out.” This warning sign means
that the topic being explained is a serious and troublesome issue in accounting, so you
should pay close attention and handle it with care.
Where to Go from Here
Accounting Workbook For Dummies is designed to maximize modularity. Each chapter
stands on its own feet to the fullest extent possible. Of course, it makes sense to read
the chapters in order, but you can jump around as the spirit moves you.
You may be a business investor who’s interested in interpreting return on investment
(ROI) (Chapter 12), or you may want to review manufacturing cost accounting (Chap-
ter 11). You may be a business manager who needs to know about analyzing profit
behavior (Chapter 10), or you may be confused about cash flow (Chapters 7 and 8). If
you’re a student studying for your first accounting exam, I suggest that you start with
Part I and read the chapters in order.
In my view, a business/financial calculator has become as essential as a TV remote
control, and I highly recommend that you invest in one (a business/financial calcula-
tor, that is, not a remote control). Hewlett-Packard (HP) and Texas Instruments (TI)
make very good ones. If you can avoid it, don’t buy the cheapest model; the next one
up usually has better financial functions and a good display. At the time of writing this
chapter, my favorite two calculators are the HP 17B and the TI BA II.

Business Accounting 
Basics

In this part . . .
A
ccountants are the scorekeepers of business.
Without accounting, a business couldn’t function; 
it wouldn’t know whether it’s making a profit; and it 
wouldn’t know its financial condition. Bookkeeping — the
recording-keeping part of accounting — must be done well
to make sure that all the financial information needed to
run the business is complete, accurate, and reliable. This
part of the book walks you through the basic bookkeeping
cycle — from making original entries through adjusting
entries, to financial statements. Before jumping into the
mechanics of bookkeeping, however, I explain the financial
effects and the manifold effects of sales and expenses on
assets and liabilities.

T
he starting point in accounting is identifying the entity being accounted for. A business
entity can be legally organized as a partnership, corporation, limited liability company, or
other structures permitted by law. Alternatively, a business entity simply may consist of the
business activities of an individual, in which case it’s called a sole proprietorship. Regardless
of how the business entity is legally established, it’s treated as a separate entity or distinct
person for accounting purposes.
Keeping the Accounting Equation in Balance
If you’ve ever studied accounting, you probably recall the accounting equation:
Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ equity
The accounting equation says a lot in very few words. It’s like the visible part of an iceberg —
a lot of important points are hidden under the water. Notice the two sides to the equation:
assets on one side and the claims against the assets on the other side. These claims arise
from credit extended to the business (liabilities) and capital invested by owners in the busi-
ness (owners’ equity). (The claims of liabilities are significantly different than the claims of
owners; liabilities have seniority and priority for payment over the claims of owners.)
Suppose a business has $10 million total assets. These assets didn’t fall down like manna
from heaven (as my old accounting professor was fond of saying). The money for the assets
came from somewhere. The business’s creditors (to whom it owes its liabilities) may have
supplied, say, $4 million of its total assets. Therefore, the owners’ equity sources provided
the other $6 million.
Business accounting is based on the two-sided nature of the accounting equation. Both
assets and sources of assets are accounted for, which leads, quite naturally, to double entry
accounting. Double entry, in essence, means two-sided. It’s based on the general economic
exchange model. In economic transactions, something is given and something is received in
exchange. For example, I recently bought an iPod from Apple Computer. Apple gave me the
iPod and received my money. Another example involves a business that borrows money from

its bank. The business gives the bank a legal instrument called a note promising to return the
money at a future date and to pay interest over the time the money is borrowed. In exchange
for the note, the business receives the money. (Chapter 3 explains how to implement double
entry accounting.)

Q.
Is each of the following equations correct?
What key point does each equation raise?
a. $250,000 Assets = $100,000 Liabilities +
$100,000 Owners’ equity
b. $2,345,000 Assets = $46,900 Liabilities +

A.
Each accounting equation offers an impor-
tant lesson.
a. Whoops! This accounting equation 
doesn’t balance, so clearly something’s
wrong. Either liabilities, owner’s equity,
or some combination of both is $50,000
too low, or the two items on the right-
hand side could be correct, in which
case total assets are overstated $50,000.
With an unbalanced equation such as
this, the accountant definitely should
find the error or errors and make appro-
priate correcting entries.
b. This accounting equation balances, but,
wow! Look at the very small size of liabil-
ities relative to assets. This kind of con-
trast isn’t typical. The liabilities of a
typical business usually account for a
much larger percentage of its total
assets.
c. This accounting equation balances, but
the business has a large negative owners’
equity. Such a large negative amount of
owners’ equity means the business has
suffered major losses that have wiped
out almost all its assets. You wouldn’t
want to be one of this business’s credi-
tors (or one of its owners either).
d. This accounting equation balances and 
is correct, but you should notice that 
the business is highly leveraged, which
means the ratio of debt to equity (liabili-
ties divided by owners’ equity) is very
high, more than 10 to 1. This ratio is
quite unusual.

Distinguishing Between Cash- and 
Accrual-Basis Accounting
Cash-basis accounting refers to keeping a record of cash inflows and cash outflows. An
individual uses cash-basis accounting in keeping his checkbook because he needs to
know his day-to-day cash balance and he needs a journal of his cash receipts and cash
expenditures during the year for filing his annual income tax return. Individuals have
assets other than cash (such as cars, computers, and homes), and they have liabilities
(such as credit card balances and home mortgages). Hardly anyone I know keeps
accounting records of their noncash assets and their liabilities (aside from putting bills
to pay and receipts for major purchases in folders). Most people keep a checkbook,
and that’s about it when it comes to their personal accounting.
Although it’s perfect for individuals, cash-basis accounting just doesn’t cut it for the
large majority of businesses. Cash-basis accounting doesn’t provide the information that
managers need to run a business or the information needed to prepare company tax
returns and financial reports. Some small personal service businesses (such as barber
shops, lawyers, and real estate brokers) can get by using cash-basis accounting because
they have virtually no assets other than cash and they pay their bills right away.
The large majority of businesses use accrual-basis accounting. They keep track of their
cash inflows and outflows, of course, but accrual-basis accounting allows them to
record all the assets and liabilities of the business. Also, accrual-basis accounting
keeps track of the money invested in the business by its owners and the accumulated
profit retained in the business. In short, accrual-basis accounting has a much broader
scope than cash-basis accounting.
A big difference between cash- and accrual-basis accounting concerns how they meas-
ure annual profit of a business. With cash-basis accounting, profit simply equals the
total of cash inflows from sales minus the total of cash outflows for expenses of making
sales and running the business, or, in other words, the net increase in cash from sales
and expenses. With the accrual-basis accounting method, profit is measured differently
because the two components of profit — sales revenue and expenses — are recorded
differently.
When using accrual-basis accounting, a business records sales revenue when a sale is
made and the products and/or services are delivered to the customer, whether the
customer pays cash on the spot or receives credit and doesn’t pay the business until
sometime later. Sales revenue is recorded before cash is actually received. The busi-
ness doesn’t record the cost of the products sold as an expense until sales revenue is
recorded, even though the business paid out cash for the products weeks or months
earlier. Furthermore, with accrual-basis accounting, a business records operating
expenses as soon as they’re incurred (as soon as the business has a liability for the
expense), even though the expenses aren’t paid until sometime later.
Cash-basis accounting doesn’t reflect economic reality for businesses that sell and buy
on credit, carry inventories of products for sale, invest in long-lived operating assets,
and make long-term commitments for such things as employee pensions and retire-
ment benefits. When you look beyond small cash-based business, you quickly realize
that businesses need the comprehensive recordkeeping system called accrual-basis
accounting. I like to call it “economic reality accounting.”

Chapter 1: Elements of Business Accounting
Q.
You started a new business one year ago.
You’ve been very busy dealing with so
many problems that you haven’t had time
to sit down and look at whether you made
a profit or not. You haven’t run out of cash
(which for a start-up venture is quite an
accomplishment), but you understand that
the sustainability of the business depends
on making a profit. The following two sum-
maries present cash flow information for
the year and information about two assets
and a liability at year-end:
Revenue and Expense Cash Flows For
First Year
$558,000 cash receipts from sales
$375,000 cash payments for purchases of
products
$340,000 cash payments for other
expenses
Two Assets and a Liability at Year-End
$52,000 receivables from customers for
sales made to them during the year
$85,000 cost of products in ending 
inventory that haven’t yet been sold
$25,000 liability for unpaid expenses
Compare the profit or loss of your 
business for its first year according to
the cash- and accrual-basis accounting
methods.
A.
Profit according to cash-basis accounting
equals the cash inflow from sales minus
the total of cash outflows for expenses
(and the total of cash outflows for expenses
equals the purchases of products plus
other expenses). Thus, under cash-basis
accounting, your business has a $157,000
loss for the year ($558,000 sales revenue –
$715,000 expenses = $157,000 loss).
Under accrual-basis accounting, you record
different amounts for sales revenue and 
the two expenses, which are calculated as
follows:
$558,000 cash receipts from sales +
$52,000 year-end receivables from 
customers = $610,000 sales revenue
$375,000 cash payments for purchases 
of products – $85,000 year-end inventory
of unsold products = $290,000 cost of 
products sold expense
$340,000 cash payments for other
expenses + $25,000 year-end liability for
unpaid expenses = $365,000 other
expenses
Deducting cost of products sold and other
expenses from sales revenue gives a net
loss of $45,000 ($610,000 sales revenue –
$290,000 cost of products sold – $365,000
other expenses = $45,000 net loss for year).
The following example question focuses on certain fundamental differences between cash-
basis and accrual-basis accounting regarding the recording of sales revenue and expenses for
the purpose of measuring profit.

Summarizing Profit Activities in the 
Income (Profit & Loss) Statement
As crass as it sounds, business managers get paid to make profit happen. Management litera-
ture usually stresses the visionary, leadership, and innovative characteristics of business
managers, but these traits aren’t worth much if the business suffers losses year after year or
fails to establish sustainable profit performance. After all, businesses are profit-motivated,
aren’t they?
It’s not surprising that the income statement takes center stage in business financial reports.
The income statement summarizes a company’s revenue and other income, expenses, losses,
and bottom-line profit or loss for a period. The income statement gets top billing over the
other two primary financial statements (the balance sheet and the statement of cash flows),
which I discuss later in this chapter. The income statement is referred to informally as the
Profit & Loss or P&L statement, although these titles are seldom used in external financial
reports. (Alternatively, it may be titled Earnings Statement or Statement of Operations.)
Financial reporting standards demand that an income statement be presented in quarterly
and annual financial reports to owners. But financial reporting rules are fairly permissive
regarding exactly what information should be reported and how it’s presented (see Chapter 5
for the full scoop on income statement disclosure).
13
Chapter 1: Elements of Business Accounting
Q.
Take a look at this extremely abbreviated
and condensed income statement for a
business’s most recent year. (Note: A
formal income statement in a financial
report must disclose more information
than this.)
Income Statement for Year
Sales revenue
$26,000,000
Expenses
24,310,000
Net income
$1,690,000
This business sells products, which are
also called goods or merchandise. The cost
of products sold to customers during the
year was $14,300,000. Expand the con-
densed income statement to reflect this
additional information.
A.
Income statement reporting requires a
company to show the cost of goods 
(products) sold as a separate expense and
deduct it immediately below sales revenue.
The difference must be reported as gross
margin (or gross profit). Therefore, the 
condensed income statement should be
expanded as follows:
Income Statement for Year
Sales revenue
$26,000,000
Cost of goods sold
14,300,000
Gross margin
$11,700,000
Other expenses
10,010,000
Net income
$1,690,000

One rule of income statement reporting is
that interest expense and income tax
expense be reported separately. The
$10,010,000 “Other expenses” in the
income statement for the answer to the
example question includes $350,000 inter-
est expense and $910,000 income tax.
Rebuild the income statement given the
information for these additional two
expenses. Hint: Profit before interest
expense is usually labeled “operating earn-
ings,” and profit after interest and before
income tax expense is usually labeled
“earnings before income tax.”

10. No specific rule governs income statement
disclosure of advertising expense. Suppose
the $10,010,000 “Other expenses” in the
income statement for the answer to the

advertising expense. Would you favor
reporting this as a separate expense in the
income statement? Hint: This question calls
for your opinion only.
Solve It
11. No specific rule governs income statement
disclosure of executive-level compensa-
tion. Suppose the $10,010,000 “Other
expenses” in the income statement for the
answer to the example question includes
$3,000,000 of executive-level compensation
that includes both base salaries and gener-
ous bonuses. Would you favor reporting
this as a separate expense in the income
statement? Hint: This question calls for
your opinion only.

Assembling a Balance Sheet
The balance sheet is one of the three primary financial statements that businesses report
(the other two being the income statement and the statement of cash flows). It’s also called
the financial condition statement or statement of financial position. The balance sheet summa-
rizes the assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity accounts of a business at an instant in time.
Prepared at the close of business on the last day of the profit period, the balance sheet pres-
ents a “freeze frame” look at the business’s financial condition.
Preparing and reporting a balance sheet takes time, so by the time you read a balance sheet,
it’s already somewhat out-of-date. The business’s stream of activities and operations doesn’t
stop, which means that from the date at which the balance sheet was prepared to when you
read it, the business will have engaged in many transactions. These subsequent transactions
may have significantly changed its financial condition. For more on the balance sheet, turn to
Chapter 6.
In accounting, the term balance refers to the dollar amount of an account, after recording all
increases and decreases in the account caused by business activities. The balance sheet
reports the balances of asset, liability, and owners’ equity accounts, but it also refers to the
equality, or balance, of the accounting equation (see the section “Keeping the Accounting
Equation in Balance” earlier in this chapter).

Chapter 1: Elements of Business Accounting
Q.
The following list summarizes the assets and liabilities of a business at the close of business on the
last day of its most recent profit period:
Amounts owed by customers to the business: $485,000
Cost of unsold products (that will be sold next period): $678,000
Cash balance on deposit in checking account with bank: $396,000
Amounts owed by business for unpaid purchases and expenses: $438,000
Notes payable to bank (on which interest is paid): $500,000
Original cost of long-term operating assets that are being depreciated over their useful lives to the
business: $950,000
Accumulated depreciation of long-term operating assets: $305,000
Using this information, prepare the business’s balance sheet.

$396,000
Accounts Payable
$438,000

Total Liabilities and Owners’ Equity $2,204,000
*Owners’ equity is determined by deducting the sum of liabilities from total assets.
Note: This balance sheet isn’t classified into current assets and current liabilities. Also, owners’
equity isn’t classified. (Chapter 6 explains the balance sheet in greater detail.)
Use the balance sheet shown in the preceding example to answer Questions 13 through 16.

Partitioning the Statement of Cash Flows
You could argue that the statement of cash flows is the most important of the three primary
financial statements. Why? Because in the long run everything comes down to cash flows.
Profit recorded on the accrual basis of accounting has to be turned into cash — and the
sooner the better. Otherwise, profit doesn’t provide money for growing the business and
paying distributions to owners.
By themselves, the income statement and balance sheet don’t provide information about the
cash flow generated by the business’s profit-making, or operating, activities. But people who
use financial reports (business managers, lenders, and investors) want to see cash flow infor-
mation. In short, financial reporting standards require a statement of cash flows. The state-
ment begins with reporting the cash flow from operating activities and also reports the other
sources and uses of cash during the period, which are divided into the following:
 Investing activities: Include the purchase and construction of long-term operating
assets such as land, buildings, equipment, machinery, vehicles, and tools. If a business
realizes cash from the disposal of such assets, the proceeds are included in this cate-
gory of cash flows.
 Financing activities: Include borrowing money from debt sources and paying loans at
maturity as well as raising capital from shareowners and returning capital to them.
Cash distributions from profit are included in this category of cash flows.
17

A.
You can determine the amount of cash flow
from operating activities by the following
calculations:
$2,120,000 net cash needed for capital
expenditures + $355,000 cash balance
increase = $2,475,000 total cash needed
$2,475,000 total cash needed – $1,775,000
net cash provided from financing 
activities = $700,000 cash flow from 
operating activities
Cash flow from operating activities is
explained in more detail in Chapter 8.
You can condense a statement of cash
flows, such as the one for the example, 
into its four basic components as follows
(negative numbers appear in parentheses):
Cash flow from 
$700,000

If you know three of the four components in a condensed statement of cash flows, you can

year (which is easy enough to determine by comparing the ending cash balance with the
beginning cash balance). And suppose you can quickly determine the cash flow from invest-
ing activities and the cash flow from financing activities (because there aren’t many transac-
tions of these two types during the year). Knowing these three factors, you can quickly
determine the cash flow from operating activities. The remainder of the increase or decrease
in cash during the year is attributable to operating activities.

Tracing How Dishonest Accounting 
Distorts Financial Statements
It goes without saying that a business should keep its accounting system as honest as the
day is long. In preparing its financial statements, a business should be forthright and not mis-
leading. As the late sportscaster Howard Cosell would say, “Tell it like it is.” I regret to tell
you that some businesses cheat in their accounting and financial reporting. Now, there’s
cheating and then there’s real cheating. So what’s the difference?
Many businesses perform cosmetic surgery on their accounts, touching up their financial
condition and profit performance. This practice is popularly called massaging the numbers.
Professional investors (as in mutual fund managers) and lenders (as in banks) know that a
certain amount of accounting manipulation goes on by many businesses, and as a practical
matter not much can be done about it.
On another level, some businesses resort to accounting fraud to put a better sheen on profit
performance and conceal financial problems. Accounting fraud is popularly called cooking
the books. Think of massaging the numbers as fibbing or putting a spin on the truth and
accounting fraud as out-and-out lying with the intent to deceive and mislead. In recent years
the incidence of accounting fraud has risen alarmingly. (Do Enron, WorldCom, and Waste
Management ring any bells?) Accounting fraud is illegal and perpetrators are subject to pros-
ecution under criminal law. Plus, victims can sue the persons responsible for the fraud.

Q.
Suppose a business has engaged in some
accounting fraud to boost its profit for the
year just ended. Assume that the business
didn’t commit any accounting fraud before
this year (which may not be true, of
course). As the result of fraudulent entries
in its accounts, the $2,340,000 bottom-line
profit reported in its income statement was
overstated $385,000. How does this dishon-
est accounting distort the business’s bal-
ance sheet?
A.
Owners’ equity is overstated $385,000
because profit increases owners’ equity.
And the overstatement of profit may have
involved the overstatement of assets, the
understatement of liabilities, or a combina-
tion of both. To correct this error, owners’
equity should be decreased $385,000. As
well, assets should be decreased $385,000,
or liabilities should be increased $385,000
(or some combination of both).

Answers to Problems on Elements 
of Business Accounting
The following are the answers to the practice questions presented earlier in this chapter.
a
Which of the following is the normal way to present the accounting equation?
c. Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ equity
The other three accounting equations are correct from the algebraic equation point of view.
However, the accounting equation is usually shown with assets on one side and the two broad
classes of claims against the assets on the other side. Note: You see answer (b) (Assets –
Liabilities = Owners’ equity) when the purpose is to emphasize the net worth of a business, or
its assets less its liabilities.
b
A business has $485,000 total liabilities and $1,200,000 total owners’ equity. What is the amount
of its total assets?
Total assets = $1,685,000, which is the total of $485,000 liabilities plus $1,200,000 owners’ equity.
c
A business has $250,000 total liabilities. When it was started the owners invested $500,000 in
the business. Unfortunately, the business has suffered a cumulative loss of $200,000 up to the
present time. What is the amount of its total assets at the present time?
Total assets = $550,000, which is the total of $250,000 liabilities plus $300,000 owners’ equity.
Notice that the original $500,000 that the owners invested in the business is reduced by the
$200,000 cumulative loss of the business, and owners’ equity is now only $300,000.
d
A business has $175,000 total liabilities. Originally, at the time of starting the business, the
owners invested $250,000 capital. The business has earned $190,000 cumulative profit since it
started (all of which has been retained in the business). What is the total amount of its assets?
Total assets = $615,000, which is the total of $175,000 liabilities and $440,000 owners’ equity.
Notice that in addition to the original $250,000 capital invested by owners, the business has
earned $190,000 profit, so its total owners’ equity is $440,000.
e
What would be the amount of accrual-basis sales revenue for the year if the business’s year-end
receivables had been $92,000? (For the original numbers, see the section “Distinguishing
Between Cash- and Accrual-Basis Accounting.”)
Sales revenue ($558,000 cash receipts + $92,000 year-end receivables) = $650,000
f
What would be the amount of accrual-basis cost of products sold expense for the year if the
business’s cost of products held in inventory at year-end had been $95,000? (For the original
numbers, see the section “Distinguishing Between Cash- and Accrual-Basis Accounting.”)
Cost of products sold ($375,000 cash payments – $95,000 year-end inventory) = $280,000
g
What would be the amount of accrual-basis other expenses for the year if the business’s liabil-
ity for unpaid expenses at year-end had been $30,000? (For the original numbers, see the sec-
tion “Distinguishing Between Cash- and Accrual-Basis Accounting.”)

to be $650,000, which is exactly equal to sales revenue. So the business breaks even for the
year. This outcome is unusual, of course; the total of expenses for the year is almost always dif-
ferent than total sales revenue for the year.
i
One rule of income statement reporting is that interest expense and income tax expense be
reported separately. The $10,010,000 “Other expenses” in the income statement for the answer
to the example question includes $350,000 interest expense and $910,000 income tax. Rebuild
the income statement given the information for these additional two expenses. Hint: Profit
before interest expense is usually labeled “operating earnings,” and profit after interest and
before income tax expense is usually labeled “earnings before income tax.”

Burying interest expense or income tax expense in a broader expense category such as 
“other expenses” or “general expenses” is unacceptable. Interest and income tax expenses are
reported toward the bottom of the income statement. They’re viewed as nonoperating expenses,
which means that they depend on how the business is financed and its income tax situation.
j
No specific rule governs income statement disclosure of advertising expense. Suppose the
$10,010,000 “Other expenses” in the income statement for the answer to the example question
includes $5,000,000 of advertising expense. Would you favor reporting this as a separate
expense in the income statement? Hint: This question calls for your opinion only.
Well, there’s no rule against disclosure of advertising expense — that’s for sure. Because it’s
such a large expense, I favor disclosing it in the income statement. But most businesses are
very sensitive about disclosing their advertising expense and, in fact, don’t disclose this
expense in their income statements.
k
No specific rule governs income statement disclosure of executive-level compensation. Suppose
the $10,010,000 “Other expenses” in the income statement for the answer to the example question
includes $3,000,000 of executive-level compensation that includes both base salaries and gener-
ous bonuses. Would you favor reporting this as a separate expense in the income statement? Hint:
This question calls for your opinion only.
Oh boy! This is a hot potato question. I’m all for open, frank, and transparent disclosure in
financial reports, but this is like believing in Santa Claus. Most businesses are very reluctant to
disclose executive-level compensation in their income statements or elsewhere in their finan-
cial reports. With no rule forcing such disclosure in their income statements, most businesses
don’t reveal this piece of information. You can ask for executive-level compensation informa-
tion if you’re on the board of directors of the business, but as an outside shareowner, don’t
expect to get this information.

Please refer to the income statement for the answer to the example question. Suppose the busi-
ness distributed $650,000 cash to its shareowners from its profit (net income) for the year. Is
this cash disbursement treated as an expense?
No, cash distributions from profit to the shareowners of a business aren’t an expense. In other
words, net income is before any distributions to shareowners.
Income statements generally don’t disclose information regarding distributions from profit (net
income) during the year. To be more accurate, I should say that an income statement doesn’t
have to disclose this information. However, some businesses don’t end their income statements
at bottom-line net income: They add net income to the retained earnings balance at the start of
the year and deduct distributions from net income during the year to arrive at the year-end bal-
ance of retained earnings. But such disclosure isn’t common practice. Distributions from net
income usually are reported in a separate financial statement called the Statement of Changes
in Owners’ Equity, which I discuss in Chapter 8.
m
Suppose $950,000 of owners’ equity consists of profit earned and not distributed by the busi-
ness. What is this amount usually called in the balance sheet? And, what is the other amount of
owners’ equity called in the balance sheet?
The $950,000 of owners’ equity over and above the amount of capital invested by the owners
typically is called retained earnings. To be more precise, business corporations and limited lia-
bility companies use this term. (If a business is organized legally as a partnership, it follows dif-
ferent practices for reporting the partners’ equity.)
n
It appears that the business can’t pay its liabilities. The two liabilities total $938,000, but the
business has a cash balance of only $396,000. Do you agree?
A business isn’t expected to hold cash equal to the total of its liabilities. In my opinion, this
business wouldn’t be judged insolvent, although this judgment depends on how conservative
or strict you are in evaluating solvency. The business’s cash flow prospects are the key factor.
The accounts receivable will be collected in the short-run, and this incoming cash will be avail-
able for paying the business’s liabilities. Also, the inventory held by the business will be sold
during the short-run and will generate cash flow.
o
Can you tell the amount of profit the business earned in the period just ended?
No, a balance sheet doesn’t report profit (net income) for the most recent period. You look to
its income statement for this key figure.
p
In a balance sheet, assets usually are listed in the order of their “nearness” to cash. Cash is
listed first, followed by the asset closest to being converted into cash, and so on. Is the
sequence of assets according to normal rules for presenting assets in balance sheets?
Yes, the sequence is correct according to conventional rules for reporting assets in a balance
sheet. Cash is listed first, followed by assets according to their “nearness” to cash. In the exam-
ple, the business doesn’t have short-term investments in marketable securities. So, its accounts
receivable asset is listed second, after cash, because these receivables will be collected in the
short-term. Inventory is listed after accounts receivable because this asset consists of products
that have to be sold before they can be converted into cash.

Financial Effects of Transactions
In This Chapter
 Identifying business transactions

 Getting a handle on the composite effect of profit and loss
T
he following three financial statements are the financial anchors and reference points of
every business:
 Balance sheet: Summarizes the business’s assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity at the
end of a period
 Income statement: Summarizes the profit-making transactions of the business for a
period of time; also known as the profit and loss (P&L) statement
 Statement of cash flows: Summarizes the business’s cash transactions for the same
period of time
The first job of accounting is to faithfully record all the transactions of the business so that
you then can prepare the financial statements listed above from the transaction records. If
you’re more the visual type, try this on for size:
Transactions →Accounting process →Financial statements
Transactions are the heartbeat of every business, which is why accountants, above all else,
must know how to record them. This chapter separates business transactions into their main
types and pays particular attention to how profit-making transactions — specifically, sales
and expenses — impact the financial condition of a business.
Note: I do not use debits and credits (see Chapter 3) in this chapter. Instead, this chapter
keeps the focus on the balance sheet, which is the summary of the financial condition of a
business.
Classifying Business Transactions
Businesses are profit-motivated, so one basic type of transactions is obvious: profit-making
transactions. In a nutshell, profit-making transactions consist of making sales and incurring
expenses. Well, if you want to be picky, a business may have other income in addition to
sales revenue, and it may record losses in addition to expenses. But the bread and butter
profit-making activities of a business are making sales and keeping expenses under control.
The profit-making transactions of a business over a period of time are reported in its income
statement (which I cover in more detail in Chapter 1).
A business’s other transactions fall into three basic categories:

 Set-up and follow-up transactions for sales and expenses: Includes collecting cash
from customers after sales made on credit are recorded; the purchase of products
(goods) that are held for some time before being sold, at which time the expense is
recorded; and making cash payments for expenses some time after the expenses are
recorded
 Investing activities (transactions): Includes the purchase, construction, and disposals
of long-term operating assets such as buildings, machinery, equipment, and tools
 Financing activities (transactions): Includes borrowing money and repaying amounts
borrowed; owners investing capital in the business and the business returning capital
to them; and making cash distributions to owners based on the profit earned by the
business
Investing and financing activities of a particular period are reported in that period’s state-
ment of cash flows (see Chapter 1). In contrast, set-up and follow-up transactions for sales
and expenses stay in the background, meaning that they are not reported in a financial state-
ment. Nevertheless, these transactions are essential to the profit-making process.
Consider, for instance, the purchase of products for inventory. As far as profit is concerned,
nothing happens until the business makes a sale of that inventory and records the cost of
goods sold expense against the revenue from the sale. Because the business needs to have
the products available for sale, the purchase of inventory is the important first step, or set-
up transaction.
In understanding accounting, you first need to be very clear about which type of transaction
you’re looking at.
28
Part I: Business Accounting Basics 
Q.
During the year, a business engaged in the
following transactions:
a. Borrowed money from a lender (for
example, a bank)
b. Purchased products that it put in inven-
tory to be sold to customers at a later
date
c. Bought new delivery trucks that will be
used for several years
d. Sold to customers products that had
been held in inventory
For each transaction, identify which type of
transaction it is according to the four basic
types:
• Profit-making activities (sales and
expenses)
• Set-up and follow-up transactions for
sales and expenses
• Investing activities
• Financing activities
A.
The transactions and types match up as
follows:
a. Financing activities
b. Set-up and follow-up transactions for
sales and expenses
c. Investing activities
d. Profit-making activities
Purchasing and constructing assets that have multi-year lives are long-term investments,
which are classified as investing activities.

Seeing Both Sides of Business Transactions
The accountant’s job is to capture all the transactions of the business, determine the
financial effects of every transaction, record every transaction in the business’s
accounts, and from the accounts prepare the financial statements.
To carry out their mission, accountants must understand how transactions (and certain
other events) affect the financial condition of the business. To illustrate the impact of
transactions, consider the case of a business that has been in operation for many years.
Its condensed balance sheet at the start of the year appears in Figure 2-1.
Most businesses report more than just the four kinds of assets shown in Figure 2-1, but
these four are the hard-core assets of a business that sells products. (“PP&E” stands
for property, plant, and equipment, which is the generic name for the long-term operat-
ing assets of a business. The term “net” means that the amount of accumulated depre-
ciation that has been recorded up to this time is deducted from the cost of the assets.)
Liabilities are divided into two types based on their sources:
 Those that arise out of operating activities
 Those that result from borrowing money on interest-bearing debt
Operating liabilities are short-term and do not bear interest. Owners’ equity is shown
in two different accounts in Figure 2-1. The first is for capital invested in the business
by its owners. This source of owners’ equity is segregated from the other owners’
account, which expresses profit that has been earned and retained by the business.
In Figure 2-1, you can see that the total assets and the total liabilities plus owners’
equity appear below the line. This information is the accounting equation of the busi-
ness. The accounting equation is in balance, as it should be, of course.

Q.
Refer to the eight basic accounts presented in the condensed balance sheet shown in Figure 2-1 —
the four assets, the two liabilities, and the two owners’ equities. How does each of the following
transactions change the company’s financial condition?
a. The business borrows $500,000 and signs a legal instrument called a note payable to the lender,
promising to pay interest over the life of the loan and to return $500,000 at a future date.
b. The business invests $250,000 in a new machine that it will use for several years and pays for
the purchase with a check.
c. The business owners invest an additional $750,000 in the business to aid in its growth and 
expansion.
d. The business distributes $100,000 of the profit it earned during the year to its shareowners.

No interest expense is recorded when the money is borrowed because interest is a time charge
for using borrowed money. Interest expenses will be recorded in each future period the money
is borrowed, starting at the time the money is borrowed.

There is no change in total assets but rather an exchange among assets: Cash decreases

charged as a depreciation expense over future periods in which the machine is used.

Suppose that all revenue transactions during the year increase cash and that all expense transac-
tions during the year decrease cash. In other words, suppose no other assets and no operating 
liabilities are affected by the profit-making activities of the business during the year (this scenario
isn’t realistic and is assumed only for this problem). The net income (bottom-line profit) of this
atypical business for the year is $950,000. How does profit change its financial condition?

Concentrating on Sales
One of the most quoted sayings in business is, “Nothing happens until you sell it.” (Another
is, “There’s no such thing as a free lunch,” but I digress.) Well, there’s no doubt that a busi-
ness has to make sales that generate enough sales revenue to overcome its expenses and
leave a residual of profit. As I’m sure you know, this is a tall task.
The effect that making a sale has on a business’s financial condition depends on when cash 
is collected from the sale. Regarding cash collection, sales come in three flavors:
 Cash sales: Cash is collected when the business makes the sale and delivers the prod-
uct and/or service to the customer.
 Credit sales: Cash isn’t collected until sometime after the sale is made; the customer is
given a period of time before it has to pay the business.
 Advance payment sales: The customer pays the business before the sale is consum-
mated, that is, before the business delivers the product and/or service to the customer.
In short, cash may be collected at the time of the sale, after this time, or before this time.
No doubt you’re familiar with cash and credit sales. However, you may be a little rusty, from
an accounting point of view, on advance payment sales. For this type of sale, at the time of
receiving an advance payment, the business does not record a sale; instead, it records a lia-
bility that stays on the books until the product or service is actually delivered to the cus-
tomer. This specific liability is one of the business’s operating liabilities.
For example, I recently sent a $500 check to The New York Times as advance payment for
delivery of the paper every day for the coming 12 months. Similarly, if I were a rabid Denver
Broncos football fan, I would buy season tickets, which require me to pay before the season
starts. Do you give gift certificates to others as birthday or holiday presents? A gift certificate
is another example of an advance payment sale. The liability of the advance payment sale is
extinguished as papers are delivered, games are played, and gift certificates are redeemed.
Suppose I tell you that a business recorded $3,200,000 sales revenue for the year just ended.
Can you tell me how its balance sheet changed as the result of that sales revenue? No, you
can’t — unless the business makes only cash sales. If the business makes credit sales or 
collects advance payments from customers for future sales, then the changes in its balance
sheet caused by sales are a little more involved. Sorry, but this is a business fact of life.

A note payable liability came due (meaning it reached its maturity date) during the year, and the
business decided not to renew (or rollover) this loan. Accordingly, the business paid $500,000 to
the lender, and the note payable was cancelled. (All interest expense on this debt was recorded
correctly during the year.) How did paying off the note payable change the business’s financial
condition?

Q.
A business makes all three kinds of sales — cash, credit, and advance payment. For the latest
year, it recorded $3,200,000 total sales revenue. Its sales caused its receivable balance to increase
$75,000 during the year and its operating liabilities balance to increase $50,000 during the year.
How did sales for the year change its financial condition?
A.
Its sales cause the following changes in the financial condition of the business:

+$50,000

+$75,000

PP&E, net
Owners’ retained earnings
+$3,200,000
Assets
+$3,250,000
=
Liabilities and Owners’ Equity +$3,250,000
Some important points to note in this scenario are:
• Credit sales cause receivables to increase $75,000 during the year, so the year-end balance of
receivables is $75,000 higher than the start-of-year balance. Generally speaking, receivables
increase when sales increase year-to-year.
• Advance payment sales cause operating liabilities to increase $50,000 during the year, so the
year-end balance of the liability for advance payments from customers is $50,000 higher than the
start-of-year balance. Generally speaking, this liability increases when sales increase year-to-
year.
The $3,200,000 sales revenue for the year increases owners’ retained earnings. But don’t
forget that the business has expenses for the year. Expenses must be deducted from 
sales revenue to get to the net effect on owners’ retained earnings, which is profit for the
year. (Expenses are examined in the section “Concentrating on Expenses” later in this
chapter.)
9.
A business sells only to other businesses and makes all sales on credit; it doesn’t have any cash
sales or advance payment sales. During the year, the business made $35,000,000 sales. From these
sales, the business collected $31,500,000 during the year, and it also collected the $3,250,000
receivables balance at the start of the year. What are the effects of these collections on the busi-
ness’s financial condition?

10. A business requires advance payments on all sales. In other words, it collects cash from customers
before products are delivered to them later. During the year, the business received $12,500,000 in
advance payments from customers. By the end of the year, the business had delivered 85 percent
of products to customers for advance payments received during the year. Also, the business deliv-
ered products to customers during the year that fully discharged the $1,500,000 balance in liabil-
ity for advance payments at the start of the year. What are the effects of these exchanges on the

these “deadbeat” customers and refused to make any more credit sales to them. The business had
to write off $150,000 uncollectible receivables. What are the effects of these events on its financial

Concentrating on Expenses
Just as cash is collected before, after, or at the time of sale, cash is paid before, after, or at
the time that an expense is recorded. The following are some examples of cash payment for
expenses:
 Paying cash before an expense is recorded: The expense of cost of goods (products)
sold is not recorded until the sale is made. (Products are bought and paid for before
they’re sold to customers.) Another example is that businesses pay for insurance poli-
cies today that provide coverage for six months or more, but the insurance expense
isn’t recorded until time passes.
 Paying cash after an expense is recorded: A business records advertising expenses
because the ads have already appeared on TV or in newspapers, but it may not pay the
bills for these ads until next year.
 Paying cash when an expense is recorded: Wages and salaries expenses are generally
recorded at the time employees are paid.
Most businesses invest in long-term operating assets, the cost of which is charged to depreci-
ation expense over many years. Essentially, a business pays for the asset today, but the cost
of the asset is recorded as expense over several future years.
Suppose I tell you that a business recorded $3,000,000 total expenses for the year just ended.
Does this simply mean that cash decreased this amount? Hardly! Recording expenses
involves other assets than just cash — it involves operating liabilities as well.

profit accounting for the year. Expenses are now dealt with to close the profit circle. During the
year just ended, the business recorded all three types of expenses — expenses recorded before,
after, and at the time of paying the expense. For the year, the business recorded $3,000,000 total
expenses. These expenses caused inventory to increase $50,000 during the year, PP&E, net to
decrease $75,000 (because depreciation on the assets was recorded), and operating liabilities to
increase $45,000. How did the company’s expenses change its financial condition?
A.
Here’s a realistic scenario for how expenses change the financial condition of the business:
Condensed Balance Sheet
Cash
–$2,930,000
Operating liabilities
+$45,000
Receivables
Interest-bearing liabilities
Inventory
+$50,000
Owners’ invested capital
PP&E, net
–$75,000
Owners’ retained earnings
–$3,000,000
Assets
–$2,955,000
=
Liabilities and Owners’ Equity –$2,955,000
Some important points to note in this scenario are:
• The business recorded $75,000 depreciation expense for the year, so its long-term operating
assets (PP&E, net) decrease this amount.
• The $50,000 increase in inventory may strike you as an odd effect of expenses. Keep in mind,
however, that a business can purchase or manufacture more inventory than it sells during the
year, in which case its inventory balance increases. That’s exactly what happened in this 
example.
• The business has $45,000 more operating liabilities at year-end than it did at the start of the
year. In other words, its unpaid expenses at the end of the year are $45,000 more than at the
beginning of the year.

13. A business recorded $4,500,000 total expenses for the year. The expenses caused $100,000
increase in its operating liabilities, and a $200,000 depreciation expense was recorded in the year.
There was no change in inventory during the year (which is unusual). How did expenses change
the financial condition of the business?

14. A business leases all its long-term operating assets (buildings, machines, vehicles, and so on). Thus,
it has no depreciation expense. For the year just ended, the business recorded $2,450,000 total
expenses. Expenses caused $75,000 increase in operating liabilities. Inventory increased $45,000
during the year. How did expenses change the financial condition of the business?

15. A business was just about ready to prepare its financial statements for the year when a sharp-
eyed bookkeeper noticed that the business had failed to accrue (record) certain liabilities for
unpaid expenses at the end of the year. So, a correcting entry has to be made. The amount of
these liabilities for unpaid expenses at year-end is $38,000. What changes in financial condition
does recording this additional amount of expense for the year cause? (Ignore income tax effects.)

Part I: Business Accounting Basics 
Determining the Composite Effect of Profit
To determine the profit or loss of a business for the year, it’s necessary to blend sales rev-
enue and expenses together. The equation for profit is as follows:
Profit = Sales revenue – Expenses
For example,
Sales revenue
$3,200,000
Less: Expenses
–3,000,000
Equals: Profit
$200,000
Determining the effects of profit on the year-end financial condition of a business is a little
more involved than the profit computation. You merge the two summaries of changes in
financial condition presented earlier in this chapter — one from revenue (see the section
“Concentrating on Sales”) and the second from expenses (see the section “Concentrating on
Expenses”) — to determine the composite effect on assets, liabilities, and owners’ retained
earnings.
Two kinds of balance sheet accounts aren’t affected by sales and expense transactions: 
interest-bearing liabilities and owners’ invested capital.
16. A business decides to engage in accounting fraud to improve its profit performance for the year.
Of course this is unethical and illegal, but the chief executive of the business is desperate, and the
chief accountant agrees to conspire with the chief executive to carry out this accounting fraud.
They decide that they can’t manipulate sales revenue for the year, so the accounting fraud has to
be done on the expense side of the ledger. The changes in financial condition caused by the actual
expenses of the business for the year are given below. How might management go about misstat-
ing the expenses in order to boost profit $125,000? (Note: You have to think like a crook to work
this problem.)

Q.
What is the composite change in the year-end financial condition of the business caused by its
profit-making activities over the year? Refer back to the financial condition changes caused by
sales and expenses, which are presented earlier in the chapter (see the example questions in the
sections “Concentrating on Sales” and “Concentrating on Expenses”), to answer this question.
A.
Combining the changes caused from sales with the changes caused from expenses gives the 
following:
Condensed Balance Sheet – Composite Net Changes From Sales and Expenses
Cash
+$245,000
Operating liabilities
+$95,000

–$75,000
Owners’ retained earnings
+$200,000
Assets
+$295,000
=
Liabilities and Owners’ Equity
+$295,000
To determine each amount of change, combine the change caused by sales and the change
caused by expenses. For instance, sales increase cash $3,175,000 and expenses decrease
cash $2,930,000, so the net change is $245,000 increase.

making activities during the year (see “Concentrating on the Composite Effect of Profit and Loss”
earlier in this chapter), what is its financial condition at the end of the year, ignoring other trans-
actions that occurred during the year?
To help you work this problem, the company’s financial condition at the start of the year is

Answers to Problems on Financial 
Effects of Transactions
The following are the answers to the practice questions presented earlier in this chapter.
a
Financing activity. To start a business, its owners invest an initial amount of capital (usually
money) and from time to time after start-up, they may invest more capital in the business.
b
Profit-making activity. Wages and salaries is a basic type of expense of all businesses.
c
Profit-making activity. The cost of utilities is a basic expense of all businesses.
d
Set-up and follow-up transactions for sales and expenses. This payment is the follow-up 
transaction that completes the previous purchase on credit.

$34,750,000 on receivables during the year ($31,500,000 + $3,250,000). Therefore, receivables
increased $250,000, as you see in the balance sheet above.

The business fulfilled 85 percent of its advanced payment for sales during the year, which means
it recorded $10,625,000 sales revenue. Also, the company earned $1,500,000 by delivering prod-
ucts to “pay off” the balance in the liability account for advance payments at the start of the year.
Sales revenue is the sum of the two, or $12,125,000. The business has not delivered on 15 percent
of its $12,500,000 advance payment sales during the year, which gives a $1,875,000 year-end bal-
ance in this liability. The year-end balance is $375,000 higher than the beginning balance in this
liability. By the way, if you got this answer right the first time around, congratulations! This is a
tough problem.

The income tax effect of recording the additional $38,000 expenses is not reflected in this
answer. The additional $38,000 is deductible to figure taxable income, so the income tax
expense for the year would decrease.

Thinking like a crook, I probably would manipulate liabilities for unpaid expenses; I would 
deliberately not record $125,000 of these liabilities. The effects of this manipulation are shown
in the condensed balance sheet above. As you see, operating liabilities are understated $125,000.
Therefore, total expenses for the year are $125,000 lower, and net income is $125,000 higher
(before income tax is taken into account). Doing accounting fraud this way may deceive auditors
because there’s no record of these unrecorded liabilities in the accounts. However, a sharp audi-
tor may notice something missing if he or she looks carefully for unrecorded liabilities.

Getting Started in the 
Bookkeeping Cycle
In This Chapter
 Establishing a chart of accounts
 Recognizing the difference between real and nominal accounts
 Appreciating the centuries-old debits and credits method
 Making journal entries for business transactions
T
he bookkeeping and recordkeeping system of a business requires an accountant to do
the following:
 Establish the chart of accounts in which the transactions of the business are recorded
 Record original entries for transactions of the business as they occur day by day
 Use the debits and credits system for recording transactions in order to keep the books
(accounts) of the business in balance
 Record additional adjusting entries at the end of the period to adjust revenue and
expense accounts in order to make profit correct
 Record certain “housekeeping” entries, called closing entries, to bring the profit
accounting process for the year to a close
This chapter explains the first three elements: the chart of accounts, original entries, and
debits and credits. Chapter 4 completes the recordkeeping cycle by explaining the last two
elements: adjusting entries and closing entries.
It makes no difference whether the bookkeeping process is handled by a person recording
entries by hand (popularly envisioned wearing a green eyeshade and arm garters and making
entries with a quill pen) or a 21st-century bookkeeper working at a computer keyboard. The
recordkeeping process is fundamentally the same: Adopt a chart of accounts, make original
entries using debits and credits to keep the books in balance, make adjusting entries to get
profit for the period right, and close the books at the end of the year. IBM does it this way,
and so does you local convenience store. The process reminds me of the saying: “The more
things change, the more things stay the same.”

Constructing the Chart of Accounts
Accounts are the basic building blocks of an accounting system. An account is a cat-
egory of information, like a file in which a certain type of information is stored. The
reason for establishing an account is that the business needs specific information
pulled together in order to prepare a financial statement or some other accounting
report.
The first step in setting up an accounting system is to identify the particular accounts
that are needed. The financial effects of transactions are recorded as increases or
decreases in accounts, and you can’t make an accounting entry for a transaction 
without having accounts to increase or decrease. In short, no accounts mean no
accounting!
Suppose you’re the chief accountant of a brand new business. It’s your very first day
on the job. Where do you start (after finding the restroom)? Your first order of busi-
ness is to establish the chart of accounts that will be used to record the transactions of
the business. The chart of accounts becomes the official set of accounts that you use
to record the effects of transactions. Unless you authorize the creation of a new
account, the accounts in the chart are the only ones you use.
The need for one account in the chart of accounts, the cash account, is pretty obvious.
A business needs to know how much money it has in its checking account with its
bank, so it must establish a cash account and record cash receipts and disbursements
in the account. Which other accounts are needed? This is the $64,000 question. To
answer this question, the chief accountant looks to the information the business needs
to report in its financial statements and income tax returns (the two major information
demands on the accounting system of a business).
Business corporations file Form 1120, U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return, with the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The first page of this income tax return requires the fol-
lowing revenue and income information:
 Line 1, Gross receipts or sales
 Line 1b, Less sales returns and allowances
 Line 1c, (Line 1 minus Line 1b)
 Line 2, Cost of goods sold
 Line 3, Gross profit (Line 1c minus Line 2)
 Line 4, Dividends
 Line 5, Interest
 Line 6, Gross rents
 Line 7, Gross royalties

Q.
Which accounts should the business estab-
lish to provide the information required 
in the first part of its annual income tax
return?
A.
The business should establish the follow-
ing accounts:
• Sales revenue for gross revenue from
sales to customers
• Sales returns and allowances for returns
of products and price reductions after
making sales
• Cost of goods sold expense for the cost of
products sold to customers
• Dividend income for income from invest-
ments in stocks of other companies
• Interest income for interest earned on
investments and loans
• Rental income for income from property
being leased to others
• Royalty income for income from mineral
rights, copyrights, and so on owned by
the business
The exact titles of these accounts vary from business to business. However, the account titles
listed here are fairly typical. The sales returns and allowance account is a contra account to
the sales revenue account, which means that it offsets the sales revenue account. The balance
in this account is deducted from sales revenue to determine net sales revenue, which is
reported on Line 1c in Form 1120. If a business knows that it won’t have any income from 
dividends, interest, rents, and royalties, then it shouldn’t bother to establish accounts for
these sources of income. No account is needed for Line 1c or Line 3 because they’re calcu-
lated amounts, not balances of accounts.

A business employs a typical range of
employees — janitors, salespeople, book-
keepers, truck drivers, managers, and so
on. It provides a basic retirement plan and
pays the premiums for employees’ medical
and hospital insurance. The annual income
tax return filed with the IRS requires the
following information: compensation of
officers; salaries and wages; employee 
benefit program; and pension and profit-
sharing plans. Should the business include
a separate expense account for each of
these compensation elements in its chart
of accounts?

4.
The income tax Form 1120 for business
corporations requires the reporting of the
following assets: trade notes and accounts
receivables; buildings and other deprecia-
ble assets; and loans to shareholders.
Should the business include separate
accounts for each of these assets in its
chart of accounts? (These are only three 
of many items of information that the IRS
requires to be reported in the balance
sheet that must be included in a business’s
annual income tax returns.)
Solve It
Distinguishing Real and Nominal Accounts
Businesses keep two types of accounts:
 Real accounts are those reported in the balance sheet, which is the summary of the
assets, liabilities, and owners’ equities of a business.
The label real refers to the continuous, permanent nature of this type of account. Real
accounts are active from the first day of business to the last day. (A real account could
have a temporary zero balance, in which case it’s not reported in the balance sheet.)
Real accounts contain the balances of assets, liabilities, and owners’ equities at a spe-
cific point in time, such as at the close of business on the last day of the year. A real
account is a record of the amount of asset, liability, or owners’ equity at a precise
moment in time. The balance in a real account is the net amount after subtracting
decreases from increases in the account.
 Nominal accounts are those reported in the income statement, which is the summary
of the revenue and expenses of a business for a period of time.
Balances in nominal accounts are cumulative over a period of time. Take the balance in
the sales revenue account at the end of the year, for example. This balance is the total
amount of sales over the entire year. Likewise, the balance in advertising expense is the
total amount of the expense over the entire year. At the end of the period, the account-
ant uses the balances in the nominal accounts of a business to determine its net profit
or loss for the period — this is the main reason for keeping the nominal accounts.

Here’s a rough analogy to help you understand the difference between real and nominal
accounts: Consider the water held behind a dam at a particular point in time. The water is
real because you can dip your toe in it. Compare this body of water with the total amount of
water that flowed through the dam over the last year. This water isn’t there because it has
already gone downriver. This amount is the measure of total flow for a period of time. Assets
are like the water behind the dam, and sales revenue is like the flow of water over the year.
Nominal (revenue and expense) accounts are closed at the end of the year. After these
accounts have done their jobs accumulating amounts of sales and expenses for the year
2006, for example, their balances are closed. Their balances are reset to zero to start the year
2007. Nominal accounts are emptied out to make way for accumulating sales revenue and
expenses during the following year. I cover closing entries in Chapter 4.

report for the year just ended, which
includes its balance sheet at year-end and
its income statement for the year. You take
the time to count the number of accounts
in each statement and find 20 accounts in
the balance sheet and 6 accounts in the
income statement. These counts do not
include calculated amounts, such as the
total of assets in the balance sheet and
gross profit in the income statement. How
many accounts does the business need?
A.
The absolute minimum number of accounts
that business needs is 20 balance sheet
(real) accounts and 6 income statement
(nominal) accounts. Otherwise, it doesn’t
have enough separation of information to
prepare its two financial statements. In
actual practice, businesses keep many more
accounts than they report in their balance
sheets and income statements.
If you were to look at the chart of accounts maintained by even a relatively small business,
you’d find hundreds of accounts (maybe more). For example, a business may keep a separate
account for each checking account it uses but, in its balance sheet, report only one cash
account, which is the combined total of all its separate cash accounts. Similarly, the busi-
ness may keep different notes payable accounts, one for each note payable obligation, but
combine all notes into one total liability amount in its balance sheet. Another example is a
business that keeps different sales revenue accounts, broken down by product lines, sales
territories, and so on. It reports only one total sales revenue account in its income statement.
(Public businesses are subject to disclosure rules regarding segment reporting of sales,
which is too technical to go into here.)

Suppose a business just opened its doors
on the first day of the year. Not a single
transaction has taken place yet in the new
year. Which of the following accounts have
balances in them, and which don’t?
• Cash
• Notes payable
• Sales revenue
• Owners’ equity — Invested capital
• Wages and salaries expense
• Inventory

This question focuses on just two accounts
taken from the chart of accounts of a busi-
ness that makes credit sales. (Even a small
business keeps hundreds of accounts.) The
first is a real account, accounts receivable.
The second is a nominal account, sales 
revenue. Are increases and decreases
recorded in both accounts during the year,
or are only increases recorded during the
year?

Chapter 3: Getting Started in the Bookkeeping Cycle
Knowing Your Debits from Your Credits
Business transactions are economic exchanges because something of value is given and
something of value is received. By its very nature, an economic exchange is a two-sided trans-
action. For example, a business sells a product for $400. It receives the money (either imme-
diately or later) and gives the product to the customer. In another example, a business
receives $10 million from a lender and gives the lender a legal instrument called a note that
promises to return the money at a future date and to pay interest every period starting from
the date of the loan forward.
Accountants and bookkeepers use an ingenious scheme to record transactions while keeping
the accounting equation constantly in balance — it’s called double-entry accounting. This
method has been in use a long time. In fact, a book published in 1494 describes the method.
What do you think of that?
Double-entry accounting records both sides of a transaction, and the accounting equation
remains in balance as transactions are recorded. For example, if a transaction decreases cash
$25,000, then the other side of the transaction is a $25,000 increase in some other asset, or a
$25,000 decrease in a liability, or a $25,000 increase in an expense (to cite three possibilities).
To keep the accounting equation in balance as they record transactions, accountants use the
system of debits and credits. The famous German philosopher Goethe is reputed to have
called double-entry accounting “one of the finest inventions of the human mind.” Well, I’m
not sure that this bookkeeping technique deserves such high praise, but it’s undeniable that
the debits and credits method has been in use over six centuries.
Figure 3-1 summarizes the basic rules for debits and credits. By long-standing convention,
debits are shown on the left and credits on the right. An increase in a liability, owners’ equity,
revenue, and income account is recorded as a credit, so the increase side is on the right. The
recording of all transactions follows these rules for debits and credits.

A good friend is reading the most recent financial report of your business. In the balance sheet,
she comes across an account called “Owners’ equity — Retained earnings.” She asks you, “Is this
an asset account? If it is, is it money in the bank?” How do you answer?
Solve It

In every account, debits are on the left, and credits are on the right. And don’t forget that
increases in assets and expenses are recorded as debits, and increases in liabilities and
sales revenue are recorded as credits. These few transactions are a very small sample of 
the large number of transactions the business makes over the course of one year.
Questions 9 through 12 use the same eight accounts given in the preceding example question.
Practically everyone has trouble with the rules of debits and credit. (I certainly did!) Frankly,
the rules aren’t very intuitive. Learning the rules for debits and credits is a rite of passage 
for bookkeepers and accountants. The only way to really understand the rules is to make
accounting entries — over and over again. After a while, using the rules becomes like tying
your shoes — you do it without even thinking about it.
Notice the horizontal and vertical lines under the accounts in Figure 3-1. These lines form the
letter “T.” Although the actual accounts maintained by a business don’t necessarily look like T
accounts, accounts usually have one column for increases and another column for decreases.
In other words, an account has a debit column and a credit column. Also an account may have
a running balance column to continuously keep track of the account’s balance.
In the following example question, the number of accounts is limited to simplify the problem;
even a small business typically needs more than 100 accounts.

Q.
Suppose a small business keeps just the
following eight accounts.
The business’s transactions during the
year include:
a. Made sales during the year for $2,400 
(all were cash sales)
b. The cost of goods sold during the year
was $1,600
c. Incurred $425 in operating expenses,
which will be paid sometime later
d. Borrowed $10,000 from bank (ignore the
interest expense on this note)
e. Cut a check for $275 in payment of oper-
ating expenses; these particular expenses
are recorded as paid and haven’t been
recorded previously in a liability account

Making Original Journal Entries
To explain and illustrate double-entry recordkeeping in the preceding section, I enter
the effects of transactions directly into accounts. By keeping the number of accounts
to a minimum, you can see the “big picture” because all assets, liabilities, owners’
equity, revenue, and expenses fit on one page. Looking at accounts this way is a useful
first step in understanding the rules of debits and credits.
However, with a large number of accounts, recording the effects of transactions
directly in the accounts of a business isn’t practical. The debit’s in one account and
the credit’s in another account, and the accounts may be far removed from one
another. A much more useful method is to record every transaction such that both
sides of the transaction are in one place; keep the debit(s) and credit(s) in the entry
for the transaction next to each other.
Therefore, the standard practice is to record transactions first in journal entries so that
both sides of a transaction are contiguous. Both the debits and credits of the transac-
tion are recorded in one place. A journal is like a diary in that it’s a chronological list-
ing of transactions. After journal entries have been recorded, the debits and credits of
the transactions are recorded in the accounts of the business. The debits and credits
are delivered to their proper addresses, which in accounting parlance is called posting
to the accounts.
The journey from transactions to financial statements is as follows:
Transactions →Journal entries →Posting to accounts →Financial statements
One reason for keeping journals instead of recording the effects of transactions
directly in accounts is that a business needs a chronological listing of all its transac-
tions in one place. With journals, each transaction is stored in one place and is avail-
able for inspection and review. At a later date, a question or challenge may arise
regarding how a transaction was recorded, and the journals allow direct access to orig-
inal recording of the transaction, which is especially important for audit purposes.
Businesses use several specialized journals, usually one for each basic type of transac-
tion. A typical business has a sales journal, purchases journal, cash receipts journal,
cash disbursements (payments) journal, payroll journal, and perhaps other journals 
as well. In addition, a business needs one general journal in which it records low fre-
quency and non-routine accounting entries. Adjusting and closing entries made at the
end of the year (discussed in Chapter 4) are recorded in the general journal.
Today, businesses use computer-based bookkeeping/accounting systems. The days of
manual journals and accounts are history. Using computerized systems, accountants
do the same things that were done in traditional bookkeeping systems, including con-
structing a chart of accounts, recording journal entries for transactions, posting the
debits and credits of journal entries in the accounts, making end-of-period adjusting
entries, and using the accounts to prepare financial statements.

Recording Revenue and Income
In Chapter 2, I explain that when making sales, a business receives cash at the time of making
the sale, after the time of sale, or before the time of sale. What about credit card sales? As
you know, individuals use credit cards for a large percent of their purchases from businesses.
As far as businesses are concerned, credit card sales are virtually the same as cash sales.
The business immediately transmits its credit card sales to its bank for deposit into its
checking account.
A business doesn’t get one hundred cents on the dollar for its credit card sales. Banks dis-
count the credit card amounts. For example, assume a bank discounts 1.5 percent from the
credit card amount. Therefore, for a $100.00 credit card sale, the bank puts only $98.50 in the
business’s checking account. The credit card discount rate can be higher or lower depending
on several factors, but a 1.5 percent discount rate is in the ballpark for many businesses.
In addition to sales revenue, a business may have other sources of income. A prime example
is investment income. Many businesses invest their spare cash in short-term marketable
securities that pay interest. Some businesses make loans to officers and employees and
charge interest on the loans, which generates interest income, of course. Legally, a business
faces few restrictions on the types of investments it can make unless the business adopts
formal limits on permissible investments.

Q.
For a particular business, the day’s sales
are summarized as follows:
Cash sales
$3,500
Credit card sales
$14,800
Credit sales
$23,400
Its bank discounts 1.75 percent from 
credit card sales. In journal entry form,

for the day.

The separate journal entries for the three
types of sales for the day are:

Sales Revenue
$3,500
Cash sales for day.

Here are a few things to note in these
entries:
• These account titles are typical but not
universal. Different businesses use
slightly different account titles.
• Credit card discount expense is recorded
for the credit card sales; in this case, the
calculation is $14,800 face value of credit
card charges × 1.75 percent discount fee
charged by bank = $259. Sales revenue is
recorded gross, or before the bank’s dis-
count is deducted.

Recording Expenses and Losses
How many expense accounts should a business maintain? There’s no easy answer to
this question. The glib answer is “As many as it needs.” To make a profit, business
managers have to control expenses, and this task requires a good deal of specific infor-
mation about expenses.
To get an idea of the broad range of expenses a business may have and therefore
needs to account for, imagine a business with $10 million annual sales revenue. With
that much revenue, you know right off that this company isn’t a small, storefront oper-
ation. The business probably has more than 50 employees and hundreds or thousands
of customers. It may have several locations, and it pays property taxes on its real
estate. The business may manufacture the products its sells, or it may be a retailer
that buys products in condition for resale. Most likely, it buys insurance coverage to
protect against various risks. It also probably advertises the products its sells. For a
$10 million business like this one, I would expect to find several hundred different
expense accounts — even a thousand or more wouldn’t surprise me.
Most businesses with $10 million annual sales revenue have total annual expenses
over $9 million, or more than 90 percent of their sales revenue. Few businesses earn 10
percent or higher bottom-line profit on their sales revenue. As you may have already
figured out, it takes a lot of accounts to keep track of over $9 million expenses.
Accountants record expenses by decreasing assets or increasing liabilities. Sounds
straightforward enough, doesn’t it? It ain’t! Many different assets and liabilities are
credited in making expense entries. The amounts recorded for certain expenses aren’t
definite or clear-cut. To complicate matters further, the liabilities used to record cer-
tain expenses are nebulous and difficult to understand. Frankly, expense accounting is
a hodgepodge, so strap on your seat belt.
Figure 3-2 presents a broad overview of expenses. This summary matches expenses
with the balance sheet accounts that are credited in recording the expenses. For
instance, in recording cost of goods sold expense, the inventory asset account is cred-
ited. Many different expenses are recorded when cash disbursements for the expenses
are made. Figure 3-2 shows that a specific expense account is recorded when a cash
payment is made. The expense could be one of many in the business’s chart of
accounts.

Q.
A business has three expenses that it must
record:
• The business issued a $45,000 check to
its advertising agency for spot commer-
cials that appeared on local television
during last month; this cost has not been
recorded yet.
• The accountant calculated that deprecia-
tion for the period is $306,500.
• The accountant calculated that the cost
of vacation and sick pay accumulated by
employees during the period just ended
is $15,400; employees have taken none of
this time yet.
What journal entries should be recorded
for these expenses?
A.
The following journal entries are recorded
for the three expenses:
Advertising Expense
$45,000
Cash
$45,000
Because no expense has been recorded
before the time of making cash payment,
the advertising expense account is debited
(increased) at the time of making payment.
Depreciation Expense
$306,500
Accumulated 
$306,500
Depreciation 
The cost of a long-term operating asset, also
called a fixed asset, is allocated over the
estimated useful life of the asset, so a frac-
tion of the cost is charged to the deprecia-
tion expense account each period. The
fixed asset is credited (decreased) — not
by a direct credit in the asset account but
by a credit in the contra account, accumu-
lated depreciation. The balance in this
contra account is deducted from the origi-
nal cost of the fixed asset.
Employees’ Benefits 
$15,400
Expense 
Accrued Expense 
$15,400
Liability
Some expenses accrue, or build up over
time, even though the business doesn’t
receive a bill for the expense. A good exam-
ple is vacation and sick pay accumulated
by employees. Rather than waiting until
individual employees actually take time off
to record the expense, the creeping liability
for this expense is recorded each period.
When the employees are paid for vacation
and sick time, the liability is debited
(decreased).

Recording Set-Up and Follow-Up Transactions
for Revenue and Expenses
Chapter 2 explains the basic types of business transactions, one of which consists of those
transactions that take place before or after revenue and expenses are recorded. These set-up
and follow-up transactions are supporting transactions for the profit-making activities of a
business. These transactions are necessary, as you can see in the following examples:
 Buying products for inventory (the goods are held in inventory until they’re sold and
delivered to customers)
 Collecting receivables from customers
 Paying liabilities for products, supplies, and services that were bought on credit
 Paying certain expenses in advance, such as for insurance policies, shipping contain-
ers, and office supplies
Profit-making activities are reported in the income statement, and investing and financing
activities are reported in the statement of cash flows. In contrast, set-up and follow-up trans-
actions for revenue and expenses aren’t reported in a financial statement. Nevertheless,
these housekeeping activities have financial consequences and must be recorded in the
accounts of a business. Although no revenue or expense account is involved in recording
these activities, these transactions change assets and liabilities.

Q.
A business purchases fire insurance on 
its building and contents. The insurance
policy covers the next six months. The
business writes a check for $25,000 to the
insurance company. Also, the business
recently purchased $328,000 of products
for inventory on credit. The products were
delivered to the company’s warehouse, and
after inspection, the company accepted the
products. Record these two transactions in
journal entry form.
A.
The journal entries for the two transac-
tions are as follows:
Prepaid Expenses
$25,000
Cash
$25,000
The cost of insurance policies is entered in
the asset account called prepaid expenses.
Over the six months of insurance coverage,
the cost is allocated to insurance expense.
The payment for the insurance policy
decreases one asset (cash) and increases
another asset (prepaid expenses).
Inventory
$328,000
Accounts Payable
$328,000
The purchase of products doesn’t result in
an expense; rather, the transaction is the
acquisition of an asset called inventory.
The cost of products remains in the asset
account until the products are sold to cus-
tomers, at which time the cost of goods sold
expense is recorded, and the asset inven-
tory is decreased. Because the purchase
was made on credit, the liability accounts
payable is credited (increased). When this
liability is paid later, the account is debited
(decreased), and cash is decreased.

Recording Investing and Financing
Transactions
Suppose a business recorded 10,000 transactions during the year. The large majority
would be sales and expense transactions and the set-up and follow-up transactions for
sales and expenses. Perhaps fewer than 100 would be investing and financing transac-
tions. Though few in number, investing and financing transactions are very important
and usually involve big chunks of money. In fact, these two types of transactions are
reported in the statement of cash flows — that ought to tell you something.
Investing activities include the purchase and construction of long-term operating
assets, such as land, buildings, machines, equipment, vehicles, and so on. In general,
these investments are called capital expenditures. (The term capital refers to the large
amounts of money invested in the assets as well as the long-term nature of these
investments.) These economic resources are also called fixed assets. They’re not held
for sale in the normal course of business; rather, they’re held for use in the operations
of the business. When grouped together in a balance sheet, fixed assets are typically
labeled property, plant, and equipment. Eventually, the business disposes of these
assets by trading them in for new assets, selling them off for residual value, or just
having the junk collector come and haul them away.
Investing transactions include acquisitions of other long-term assets, such as intangi-
ble resources (patents, for example), rental real estate, and research projects in the
development stage. For example, a business could invest in a sports franchise, such as
the Oakland Raiders. (Being a Denver Broncos fan, I doubt if I would buy the stock
shares of a business that invested in the Oakland Raiders — just kidding!)
Financing activities basically fall into three categories:
 A business borrows money on the basis of interest-bearing debt and either pays
these loans at their maturity dates or renews them.
 A business raises capital (usually money) from shareowners and may return
some of the invested capital to them.
 A business distributes cash to its shareowners based on its profit performance.
These are the three basic kinds of financing activities. Large public corporations
engage in much more complex and sophisticated financing deals and instruments than
these basic types, but those activities are beyond the scope of this book.

Q.
The investing and financing activities for
the year of a new, start-up business corpo-
ration are summarized as follows:
• Received $10,000,000 from a venture cap-
ital (VC) firm; in exchange, the business
signed a $5 million note payable 
(interest-bearing, of course) to the VC
firm and issued shares of stock to the 
VC firm equal to 10 percent of the total
number of shares of stock issued by the
business
• Purchased various long-term operating
assets for total cash payments of
$6,000,000
Make the journal entries for these investing
and financing activities.
A.
The journal entries for these investing and
financing activities are as follows:
Cash
$10,000,000
Notes Payable
$5,000,000
Owners’ Equity — 
$5,000,000
Invested Capital
Property, Plant, & 
$6,000,000
Equipment
Cash
$6,000,000
One-half of the money invested in the start-
up business by the VC firm is secured by a
note payable on which the business has to
pay interest. This transaction is recorded in
the notes payable liability account to indi-
cate that the business has the legal obliga-
tion to pay interest and to pay the loan at its
maturity date. The other half of the money
that the VC firm put in the business is attrib-
uted to the account for capital stock shares
issued by the business. The account title
property, plant, and equipment is a generic
title for long-term operating assets. The
business would maintain more-specific
accounts for each major asset purchased,
such as buildings, machinery, vehicles, 
and so on.

Answers to Problems on 
the Bookkeeping Cycle
The following are the answers to the practice questions presented earlier in this chapter.
a
A business rents the building that houses its retail store, its warehouse, and its administrative
offices. It pays rent in cash, so obviously the business needs a cash account. Should the busi-
ness include an expense account for rent in its chart of accounts?
Sure; the business definitely needs a rent expense account in which to record the payments to
the landlord.
b
A business borrows money from its bank. Identify the liability account and the expense account
that it should include in its chart of accounts for the borrowing of money.
The business needs a notes payable liability account and an interest expense account. In fact, it
needs a separate note payable liability account for each loan from the bank, although it proba-
bly needs only one interest expense account.
c
A business employs a typical range of employees — janitors, salespeople, bookkeepers, truck
drivers, managers, and so on. It provides a basic retirement plan and pays the premiums for
employees’ medical and hospital insurance. The annual income tax return filed with the IRS
requires the following information: compensation of officers; salaries and wages; employee ben-
efit program; and pension and profit-sharing plans. Should the business include a separate
expense account for each of these compensation elements in its chart of accounts?
Because the business needs to separate out information for the various components of its total
cost of labor according to the categories required in its income tax return, it should set up a
separate expense account for each of the categories listed in the question.
Most businesses don’t disclose detailed information about their labor costs in their income state-
ments as required in their federal income tax returns. If total labor cost is disclosed — and not all
businesses disclose this expense separately — it’s typically reported as one total amount. You
seldom see compensation of officers reported as a separate expense in an income statement,
although there’s no rule against doing so.
d
The income tax Form 1120 for business corporations requires the reporting of the following
assets: trade notes and accounts receivables; buildings and other depreciable assets; and loans
to shareholders. Should the business include separate accounts for each of these assets in its
chart of accounts? (These are only three of many items of information that the IRS requires to be
reported in the balance sheet that must be included in a business’s annual income tax returns.)
The fairly obvious answer is that a business should establish separate accounts for these differ-
ent assets. Typical titles for these accounts are: accounts receivable; notes receivable; build-
ings; machinery; equipment; vehicles; and loans to offices and shareholders. Exact titles vary
from business to business.
e
Suppose a business just opened its doors on the first day of the year, and not a single transac-
tion has taken place yet in the new year. Which of the following accounts have balances in
them, and which don’t?
• Cash
• Notes payable
• Sales revenue
68
Part I: Business Accounting Basics 

• Owners’ equity — Invested capital
• Wages and salaries expense
• Inventory
The real accounts, which are cash, notes payable, owners’ equity — invested capital, and
inventory, start the year with balances.
The nominal accounts, which are sales revenue and wages and salaries expense, start the year
with zero balances.
f
This question focuses on just two accounts taken from the chart of accounts of a business 
that makes credit sales. (Even a small business keeps hundreds of accounts.) The first is a real
account, accounts receivable. The second is a nominal account, sales revenue. Are increases 
and decreases recorded in both accounts during the year, or are only increases recorded during
the year?
Both increases and decreases are recorded in the accounts receivable asset account. Increases
are recorded for sales made on credit, and decreases are recorded for collections from cus-
tomers. In contrast, the sales revenue account records only increases during the year. To be
more precise, some decreases may be recorded in this revenue account, but they’re the excep-
tion rather than the rule. After recording sales revenue, an error may be discovered that
requires a decrease in the account to correct the error.
g
The following condensed balance sheet presents eight core accounts of a business. Which of
the eight accounts have a high frequency of transactions recorded in them during the year, and
which have a low frequency of transactions? In other words, which of these eight are busy
accounts, and which are not?

A good friend is reading the most recent financial report of your business. In the balance sheet,
she comes across an account called “Owners’ equity — Retained earnings.” She asks you, “Is
this an asset account? If it is, is it money in the bank?” How do you answer?
No, no, no, no! Many people assume that retained earnings is an asset account and, in particu-
lar, that it’s money stashed away someplace. (The title of the account may suggest this mislead-
ing interpretation.) You should stress that assets are listed under assets in the balance sheet
and that assets aren’t tucked under owners’ equity on the other side of the balance sheet.
Retained earnings is no more an asset than notes payable. Retained earnings is one of the
sources of assets accounts reported on the right-hand side of the balance sheet. Basically, it
says that $400,000 of the $1,500,000 total assets of the business is from the earning of profit
over the years that has been retained and not distributed to its shareowners.

Over the course of a business day, a few customers return products to the business. For the

How should the product returns be recorded?
Sales Returns & Allowances
$2,300
Cash
$2,300
In this scenario, the debit isn’t in the sales revenue account but rather in sales returns and
allowances account, which is the contra account to sales revenue. The balance in this account
is deducted from sales revenue to determine net sales revenue, and the balance in sales returns
and allowances is compared with the balance in sales revenue to gauge the returns against
sales. (Also, I should mention that a second entry should be made to record the return of prod-
ucts to inventory. The question doesn’t give the cost of the goods returned by customers, so
you’re not asked to include this entry.)

A business invests in short-term government securities to earn income on excess cash that it

Its actuarial firm informs the business that the cost of its employees’ retirement pension benefit
for the period is $565,000. According to the contract with its employees, the business decides
to transfer $300,000 to the trustee of the pension plan and to defer payment of the remainder
until a later time (which it has the option to do). No entry has been made for this expense yet.
What journal entry should be made for this expense?
Employees’ Benefit Expense

Cash
$300,000
Employees’ Retirement Liability

Determining the annual cost of a defined benefits pension plan is an exceedingly complex com-
putation. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) lays down the general rules for
United States businesses. You have to be a CPA to wade through all these rules, and even some
CPAs find it tough going. I should mention that many business corporations defer funding of
their employee pension plans. Some of these companies have gone into bankruptcy, making
their ability to fully fund their pension plans doubtful.

Unfortunately, one of the major customers of the business declared bankruptcy. This customer
owes the business $35,000. The business has already recorded the credit sale to the customer
and the cost of goods sold for the sale. After careful analysis, the business comes to the conclu-
sion that it will not collect a dime from this customer. The business doesn’t record an expense
caused by uncollectible receivables until it actually writes off the receivable. What journal
entry should be made for this expense?
Bad Debts Expense
$35,000
Accounts Receivable
$35,000
I deliberately made this bad debt that has to be written off as uncollectible a relatively large
amount in order to call your attention to this problem. Basically, the business gave away its
products for nothing. That really smarts! Of course, the business should shut off credit privi-
leges to this customer and also consider reporting this incident to credit-rating agencies.
y
The business buys on credit a large supply of shipping containers that should be enough for
the next six months of deliveries. The bill for the purchase is $26,500, and the business will pay
it in about 30 days. What journal entry should be made for this transaction?
Prepaid Expenses
$26,500
Accounts Payable
$26,500
When some of the containers are used to ship the products sold to customers, an entry is made
to remove the appropriate amount from the prepaid expenses asset account and to charge this
amount to an expense, such as transportation or shipping expense. The prepaid expense
account may be called something more specific, such as shipping containers.

The business receives $49,000 from customers in payment for their previous purchases on credit
from the business. To encourage prompt payment, the business offered its customers a 2 percent
discount off the sales invoice amount if they paid within ten days of sale, and all the customers
took advantage of this incentive. What journal entry should be made for this transaction?
Cash
$49,000
Sales Discounts
$1,000
Accounts Receivable
$50,000
72
Part I: Business Accounting Basics 

In recording sales, you record the full amount (before any prompt payment discount) in the
sales revenue account and in the accounts receivable account. Therefore, the accounts receiv-
able account for these sales has a balance of $50,000. This amount is fully discharged when the
customers take the 2 percent prompt payment discount ($50,000 × 2 percent = $1,000). The
business records $1,000 in the sales discounts account, which is usually viewed as a sales rev-
enue contra account (not an expense account).
B
The business enters into a contract with a major supplier in which it agrees to buys a minimum
amount of products every month over the next five years. Also, set prices are established in the
contract. As of yet, the business hasn’t made a purchase under this contract, but it expects to
do so in the near future. Should a journal entry be made for entering into this contract?
Even though it’s an important event, no entry is made for entering into this purchase contract.
However, financial reporting disclosure standards require that salient details of this contract be
presented in a footnote to the financial statements. The one escape clause, or loophole, in this
disclosure standard is that the business doesn’t have to disclose the details of the contract if it
judges that the contract isn’t material, or significant in the affairs of its operations.
C
A few days after recording the purchase of products on credit, the business discovers that
some of the products are defective. The business hasn’t paid for the purchase yet, and the
vendor agrees to accept return of these defective products for full credit. The products
returned to the vendor cost $16,300. What journal entry should be made for this transaction?
Accounts Payable
$16,300
Inventory
$16,300
Some accountants argue that instead of crediting the asset inventory in a scenario such as this,
a contra account called purchase returns and allowances should be credited. The balance in this
contra account is deducted from total purchases for the year to determine net purchases.
Unless purchase returns are a serious problem, I favor the entry shown above.
D
A business corporation needed more capital to expand and grow, so it issued additional stock
shares for a total of $25,000,000. What journal entry should be made for this financing transaction?
Cash
$25,000,000
Owners’ Equity — Invested Capital
$25,000,000
E
A business has had a very good year; its $58,000,000 net income for the year is an all-time high.
Being in a generous mood, its board of directors declares a whopping cash distribution of
$30,000,000 based on the business’s record-setting performance. What journal entry should be
made for this financing transaction?
Owners’ Equity — Retained Earnings
$30,000,000
Cash
$30,000,000
Instead of directly debiting (decreasing) the retained earnings account, as shown in the entry
above, some accountants favor making two entries for dividends, as follows:
Dividends
$30,000,000
Cash
$30,000,000
Owners’ Equity — Retained Earnings
$30,000,000
Dividends
$30,000,000
As you can see, the end result is the same: The retained earnings account is decreased by the
amount of the dividends.

T
he end of its fiscal year is a very important time for a business. Accountants prepare 
the business’s income statement and statement of cash flows for the year as well as its
balance sheet. The board of directors critically reviews these financial statements to assess
the business’s financial performance and position and to plan the future course of the busi-
ness. The financial statements are sent to lenders and shareowners who make their lending
and investment decisions based on these accounting reports.
In short, the annual financial statements of a business are extraordinarily important.
Accordingly, the financial statements require extraordinarily good accounting; financial
statements are no better than the quality of accounting behind them. As I explain in Chap-
ter 3, good accounting demands a well-designed and reliable recordkeeping system, one
that records the business’s transactions during the period completely and accurately.
This chapter moves on to the additional accounting procedures done at the end of the
period. An accountant can’t use a business’s various accounts to prepare financial state-
ments until these end-of-period accounting steps are completed. As the saying goes, “It ain’t
over until the fat lady sings.”
Getting Accurate with Adjusting Entries
During an accounting period, certain expenses either aren’t recorded or aren’t fully recorded.
The accountant waits until the end of the period and records adjusting entries for these
expenses. In addition to expenses, revenue and income accounts may also need adjusting
entries at the end of the period. Adjusting entries complete the profit accounting process 
for the period.
The term “adjusting” doesn’t mean “fiddling with.” Adjusting entries aren’t made to manipu-
late profit, such as to move profit closer to the forecast target for the period. Rather, an
accountant makes adjusting entries to make profit for the period as accurate as possible. 
In other words, adjusting entries make revenue and expenses correct for the period, and

without them, the bottom-line net income for the period would be wrong. Keep in mind that
the managers, directors, lenders, and shareowners of a business rely on the profit number
more than any other figure in the business’s financial statements.
As you may know, businesses prepare quarterly (three-month) financial statements. In this
chapter, I focus on the annual (twelve-month) accounting period. In the business world (and
for economic analysis in general), one year is the standard time unit. One year includes the
complete cycle of seasonal variations that many businesses experience. The annual income
statement draws the most attention in business financial reporting, and everyone holds the
annual income statement to high standards of accounting.
In broad overview, year-end adjusting entries are needed for two reasons:
 To correct errors that may have crept into the recordkeeping process
 To make final entries for the year in revenue, income, expense, and loss accounts so
that the profit or loss for the year is accurate (or as accurate as possible given the
inherent accounting problems of measuring profit and loss)
An accounting system involves an enormous amount of data and detail, so safeguards and
procedures should be put in place to prevent bookkeeping errors. A business is well-advised
to conduct a thorough search at the end of the year for bookkeeping errors that have gone
undetected. In the section “Instituting Internal Controls” later in the chapter, I discuss internal
accounting controls that should be put into place to minimize bookkeeping errors. Despite
their best efforts, most businesses find that errors sneak into their bookkeeping systems.
76
Part I: Business Accounting Basics 
Q.
At year-end, the business searches for
bookkeeping errors that may have gone
undetected. Based on its year-end review,
the business discovers that some office
and computer supplies were thrown away
and no entry was made. (The supplies
were thrown out because they were no
longer of any use, but the bookkeeping
department wasn’t informed that the 
supplies had been put in the Dumpster.)
In general, at the time of purchase, the
costs of office and computer supplies
are entered (debited) in an asset account
called prepaid expenses. As these supplies
are used, the appropriate amount of cost
is removed from the asset account and
recorded to expense. The cost of the dis-
carded supplies was $4,800. What adjusting
entry should be made to correct this error?
A.
The entry to correct the error of not record-
ing the cost of supplies thrown away is:
Office and Computer 
$4,800
Supplies Expense
Prepaid Expenses
$4,800
You could argue that throwing away office
and computer supplies causes a special
type of loss that should be recorded in 
a separate loss account, but I think that
most accountants would put the cost of
discarded office and computer supplies in
the regular expense account.

to the amount withheld from employees’
paychecks. The amount of employer’s
social security tax for the last pay period is
$29,600. What adjusting entry should be
made to correct this error?

Breaking Down the End-of-Year 
Adjusting Entries
The chief accountant of a business, usually known as the Controller, must know which
end-of-year adjusting entries should be made and should follow through to make sure
that these critical entries are recorded correctly. In most businesses, the Controller
takes a hands-on approach in recording adjusting entries at the end of the year.
Recording year-end adjusting entries marks a dividing line between bookkeeping and
accounting. Bookkeeping consists of following established rules for accounting and
recordkeeping, and the chief accountant makes and enforces the rules and takes
charge of the year-end adjusting entries.
Recording depreciation expense
The theory of depreciation isn’t complicated. Businesses invest in long-term operating
assets such as land, buildings, machines, equipment, delivery trucks and cars, fork
lifts, office furniture, computers, and so on. These are called fixed assets because
they’re fixed in place, or stationary (well, trucks and cars move around of course). The
term “fixed” also implies that the assets aren’t held for sale (that is, not until they
reach the end of their useful lives to the business). In a balance sheet, these assets typ-
ically are reported in a category called property, plant, and equipment (although report-
ing practices vary on this point).
Charging the entire cost of fixed assets to expense at the time they’re bought or con-
structed wouldn’t be very smart. The obvious thing to do is to allocate the cost of a
fixed asset over the years of its useful life; this practice is called depreciation. Ah, but
here’s the rub. Can you predict the future useful life of a fixed asset? A building may
stand 40 or 50 years — or more. Some machines don’t really wear out; with proper
maintenance and repair, they could last indefinitely. Another complicating factor is
that businesses replace many fixed assets before the end of their useful lives — not
because they wear out physically, but because they become obsolete and inefficient.
Congress charges the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), everyone’s favorite government
agency, with the responsibility of implementing income tax legislation. The income tax
law and IRS rulings deal with depreciation in a practical, if not entirely correct theoreti-
cal, manner. Useful life guidelines have been established for several categories of fixed
assets. Generally speaking, these estimates are shorter than the actual useful lives of
fixed assets.
For example, a business building is depreciated over 39 years, even though many
buildings are used longer, and trucks are depreciated over five years, even though they
may be driven for more years. As a practical matter, many businesses (probably the
majority) simply adopt the depreciation useful life estimates permitted under the fed-
eral income tax law, although the estimates conflict with economic reality to a certain
extent.
78
Part I: Business Accounting Basics 

In the entry, I debit a specific depreciation expense account, but this doesn’t mean that this
depreciation account is disclosed separately in the business’s income statement. Probably
it’s grouped with other depreciation expense accounts, and only one total depreciation
expense is reported in the income statement. A full-year depreciation amount is recorded
because the business has used the asset the entire year. The calculation is $57,750 ÷
3 years = $19,250 per year.
Instead of crediting (decreasing) the fixed asset account, the standard accounting practice is
to credit accumulated depreciation, which is the contra account to the fixed asset account. In
essence, the contra account is the credit side of the fixed asset account. It’s maintained so
that both the original cost of fixed assets and the cumulative depreciation amount on the
fixed assets are available for reporting in the balance sheet.

Chapter 4: The Bookkeeping Cycle: Adjusting and Closing Entries
Q.
A business bought new computer software
for $57,750 at the start of the year. It
decides to follow IRS rules for depreciation
of computer software and thus will depreci-
ate the software cost over three years. The
straight-line method (equal amounts per
year) is used. The business has not
recorded any depreciation on this software
during the year. What year-end adjusting
entry is recorded for depreciation of the
computer software?
A.
Computer software isn’t your typical depre-
ciable fixed asset. Because it’s hard to see
or touch computer software, you may con-
sider it to be an intangible asset. (I discuss
intangible assets in the next section.)
However, computer software is part and
parcel of using computer hardware, and
computer hardware isn’t good for anything
without software to tell it what to do.
The entry to record the annual deprecia-
tion on the computer software is:
Depreciation Expense — 
$19,250
Computer Software
Accumulated Depreciation — $19,250
Computer Software
Depreciation also raises the question of whether each year of using a fixed asset should be
charged with the same amount of depreciation. Or should some years be hit with more
depreciation expense than others? Generally the answer to this question boils down to a
choice between the straight-line depreciation method (an equal amount is charged to expense
each year) and an accelerated depreciation method (earlier years are hit with more expense
than later years). I explain depreciation in-depth in Chapter 9. My purpose here is simply to
illustrate the year-end adjusting entry for depreciation.

Recording amortization expense
In addition to tangible fixed assets, a business may invest in intangible assets, which can’t be
seen or touched. The value of an intangible asset is rooted in law. For example, a patent gives
the owner the exclusive legal right to use the patent in the pursuit of profit. No one else can
legally use the patent without being held liable for infringement. There are all sorts of intangi-
ble assets. For instance, a business may purchase a list consisting of thousands of names of
potential customers or acquire the right to use an established trade name and logo.
The acquisition of an intangible asset is recorded as a debit (increase) in an asset account.
The cost of an intangible asset usually is allocated over its predicted useful life to the busi-
ness, much like depreciation (see the preceding section). Allocating the cost of an intangible
asset to expense over the years of its useful life is called amortization.
Q.
A business invests in a franchise, which
gives it the right to operate under a well-
known trade name and logo. The franchise
contract is for ten years, and the business
pays $250,000 to the franchisor. What
adjusting entry should be made at the end
of the first year concerning the cost of the
franchise?
A.
At the end of the first year, the business
has used up one year of the ten-year fran-
chise investment. Therefore, the following
year-end adjusting entry is made:
Franchise Amortization 
$25,000
Expense
Franchise
$25,000
Generally, the straight-line amortization method is used, which means that an equal amount
is charged to expense each year. The asset account is credited (decreased) in recording
amortization expense. A contra account is not used to accumulate amortization.

Recording other adjusting entries
Depending on the business, year-end adjusting entries are made for:
 Investment income that has been earned but not recorded
 Bad debts expense (caused by uncollectible accounts receivable)
 Inventory losses due to shrinkage and write-downs required by the lower of cost or
market (LCM) accounting rule
 Losses due to asset impairments
 Buildup of liabilities for operating expenses that haven’t been recorded
 Income tax liability based on the final determination of income tax for the year
 Liability for product warranty and guarantee costs
 Increases in liability for unfunded employees’ retirement benefits and for post-
retirement medical and healthcare benefits
This list is quite a dog’s breakfast, isn’t it? And I don’t even list all possible adjusting entries
made by businesses! This list should give you some idea of the burden on the chief account-
ant of a business to make sure that all its revenue and expenses are correctly recorded for
the year.

I don’t discuss several bookkeeping procedures connected with the allowance method for
recording bad debts expense because my goal simply is to illustrate that bad debt expense
can be recorded before specific accounts receivable are actually identified and written off as
uncollectible. The compelling theory of the allowance method is that the expense is
recorded in the same period as the credit sales that generated the bad debts. On the other
hand, estimating the amount of future write offs of accounts receivable is very tricky and is
open to manipulation. As a matter of fact, the IRS doesn’t permit businesses other than finan-
cial institutions to use the allowance method.
The following questions offer examples of common year-end adjusting entries made by busi-
nesses, but a particular business doesn’t necessarily make every one of the following adjust-
ing entries. For instance, consider a business that makes only cash sales and no credit sales.
This business doesn’t have bad debts expense from uncollectible accounts receivable, but it
does have expenses from taking counterfeit currency, accepting bad checks, making mis-
takes in giving change to customers, and thefts from cash registers.

Q.
A business makes mostly credit sales. At
the end of the year, its accountant does an
aging analysis of its accounts receivables,
analyzing the receivables according to how
old they are. Generally, the older a receiv-
able is, the greater the risk of not collecting
it or not collecting the entire amount owed
by the customer. At the end of the year, the
business has $4,538,600 total accounts
receivable. This ending balance doesn’t
include specific accounts receivable that
were written off during the period. Based
on its aging analysis, the business esti-
mates that sooner or later about $95,000 of
the ending balance of its accounts receiv-
able will not be paid by customers. What
year-end adjusting entry is made?
A.
There are two methods of accounting for
bad debts expense. In the direct write-off
method, no expense is recorded until spe-
cific accounts receivable are actually writ-
ten off. Under this method, no adjusting
entry is made at year-end because the busi-
ness hasn’t identified specific customers’
accounts from its accounts receivable at
year-end that should be written off. During
the year, the business did write off specific
receivables, and bad debts expense was
debited (increased) in these entries. Only
these write-offs are recorded in the bad
debts expense account.
In the allowance method, based on the esti-
mated amount of accounts receivable that
will have to be written off in the future, the
following entry is made:
Bad Debts Expense
$95,000
Allowance for Doubtful 
$95,000
Accounts
Allowance for doubtful accounts is the
contra account to the accounts receivable
asset account.

account. At the end of the year, $48,500

Closing the Books on the Year
The annual income statement of a business is prepared from its revenue, other income,
expense, and loss accounts for the year. Indeed, where else could information for preparing
the income statement come from? Accountants use these accounts to determine the amount
of profit or loss for the year. I needn’t remind you how important the annual profit number is
to the managers and directors of the business as well as its lenders and shareowners.
Even a modest-size business may have 100 or so revenue accounts and 1,000 or so expense
accounts. Managers need a lot of detailed information to run their businesses, so they
depend on their accountants to generate regular reports that provide the detailed account
information they need for decision-making and management control. In sharp contrast, rela-
tively few lines of information are included in the external income statement distributed to a
business’s lenders and shareowners. In its external income statement, the business com-
presses its many revenue accounts into only one or two sales revenue lines and its many
expense accounts into relatively few expense lines. (I say more about this funneling of infor-
mation in Chapter 5.)
After the business has prepared its annual financial statements, the revenue and expense
accounts have served their dual purpose — to provide information for preparing the income
statement and to aid in determining profit or loss for the year. What happens to these rev-
enue and expense accounts after the year is concluded? The traditional bookkeeping proce-
dure is to make closing entries in the accounts. These special entries close, or shut down, the
revenue and expense accounts for the year just ended. Also, the amount of profit or loss for
the year is recorded in the retained earnings account.
In the few pages I have here to illustrate closing entries, I can’t show you a hundred revenue
accounts and a thousand expense accounts. So in the following example, I use just one sales
revenue account and only four expense accounts. This scenario isn’t realistic, but it gets the
point across.

86
Part I: Business Accounting Basics 
Q.
At the end of the year, after all year-end adjusting entries have been made and posted, the bal-
ances in the revenue and expense accounts of the business are as follows:
What entry is made to close the nominal accounts and enter the profit or loss for the year?
A.
The journal entry to close the books is as follows:
Sales Revenue
$4,526,500
Cost of Goods Sold Expense
$2,725,000
Selling & Administrative Expenses
$1,228,500
Interest Expense
$175,000
Income Tax Expense
$138,000
Owners’ Equity — Retained Earnings
$260,000
Cost of Goods Sold Expense
$2,725,000
Selling & Administrative Expenses
$1,228,500
Interest Expense
$175,000
Income Tax Expense
$138,000
Sales Revenue
$4,526,500
The debit to sales revenue and the credits to expenses close out these accounts. The
$260,000 profit for the year (sales revenue less all expenses) is recorded in the retained earn-
ings account, where it belongs. Are the books still in balance? In other words, is the account-
ing equation still in balance after making this entry? Sure. The total credit in this closing
entry equals the total debit. So this entry doesn’t throw the accounting equation out of 
balance.

Chapter 4: The Bookkeeping Cycle: Adjusting and Closing Entries

Instituting Internal Controls
Have you ever made an error in your checkbook or forgot to pay a bill on time? Have
you ever misplaced an important document that you desperately needed but couldn’t
find? Have you started to fill out a loan application and realized that you don’t keep
records for the types of information the lender wants to know? (Trust me; you don’t
want to know my answers to these questions.) Your individual bookkeeping system
may have holes in it, but you can probably get by. In contrast, a business can’t get by if
its bookkeeping system is full of errors and doesn’t provide the information account-
ants need. A good accounting system is a matter of life and death for a business.
A business accounting system has many components:
 The forms and procedures used to facilitate business transactions and activi-
ties, such as making purchases, paying bills, depositing cash receipts in the
bank, preparing payroll checks, and so on
 The chart of accounts, which I discuss in Chapter 3
 The bookkeeping procedures used to record its transactions, which should
work perfectly if no errors are made
Bookkeeping errors can happen, of course. (I presume you’ve heard of Murphy’s Law:
“If something can go wrong, it will.”) To counteract bookkeeping errors, a layer of inter-
nal accounting controls is superimposed on the recordkeeping procedures of the busi-
ness. This layer of controls builds redundancy into the accounting system in that
accountants take extra steps to double-check the data and information recorded in the
original entries and accounts. It’s like looking at your speedometer not once but twice
to make sure your speed is acceptable. Businesses know that effective internal
accounting controls reduce the incidence of recordkeeping errors to a minimum, and
that’s extremely important.
The accountant’s function extends beyond establishing and policing internal account-
ing controls. The accounting department is assigned responsibility for designing and
enforcing controls to guard against a broad range of threats facing the business.
Businesses are at risk from all sorts of dishonesty, theft, and fraud. They handle a lot
of cash and have valuable assets, so businesses are natural targets for people who
steal and cheat. Everyone that a business deals with poses a potential risk.
Another serious problem to consider is that instead of being the victim, a business
may be the perpetrator of wrongdoing. A business may cheat its employees and cus-
tomers, knowingly violate laws, or resort to accounting fraud to make its financial state-
ments look better than the facts support. In other words, a business may cook its
books. You may have heard about Enron and other high profile accounting fraud scan-
dals that led to the passage of the federal Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This legislation
puts a heavy burden on the top-level executives of public companies to certify that
their businesses have effective controls to prevent fraudulent financial reporting. (For
more on the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, see Sarbanes-Oxley For Dummies by Jill Gilbert
Welytok.)
The chief accountant of a business has to make sure basic internal accounting controls
are in place and working effectively to minimize bookkeeping errors. In addition, he or
she is responsible for establishing effective controls that prevent employee theft and
embezzlement as well as fraud against the business by its customers, vendors, and the
other outside parties it deals with. Furthermore, a business needs to adopt controls to
prevent it from issuing fraudulent financial statements. All this is a tall order, to say the
least!

Q.
The business has established an internal
control procedure that, for every cash dis-
bursement $2,500 or more, a second man-
ager must countersign the check. The
manager who has authority to initiate the
disbursement signs the check and then
sends the check with supporting documen-
tation to the second manager for his or her
signature. What is the logic of this control?
A.
The theory behind this internal control
procedure is that the second manager will
make a careful review and judge whether
the payment is for a legitimate purpose
and is reasonable in amount. If two persons
have to sign off on expenditures over a cer-
tain amount, then they would have to col-
lude to pull off a scam against the business.
Even if someone were inclined to make a
quick buck and didn’t care how you did it,
he or she probably wouldn’t be in cahoots
with another untrustworthy crook.

Answers to Problems on the 
Bookkeeping Cycle
The following are the answers to the practice questions presented earlier in this chapter.
a
In its year-end review for errors, a business discovers that the recent bill from its law firm was
entered as $6,500 instead of $5,600, which is the correct amount. The bill has not been paid yet.
What adjusting entry should be made to correct this error?
Accounts Payable
$900
Legal Expense
$900
This type of error is called a transposition error because two digits in the number are trans-
posed, or switched. It’s a common error. Experienced bookkeepers and accountants know that
this type of error is divisible by nine. (The difference caused by any two digits you transpose is
always divisible by nine.)
b
In its year-end review, for errors a business discovers that an order of products was shipped to
a customer, and the cost of the products was correctly charged to cost of goods sold expense.
However, the paperwork for this particular sales order wasn’t sent to the bookkeeping depart-
ment on time. Therefore, the sale hasn’t been recorded. The total price for this credit sale is
$36,260. What adjusting entry should be made to correct this error?
Accounts Receivable
$36,260
Sales Revenue
$36,260
The sales revenue for this sale should be recorded because the sale was completed, and the
products were delivered to the customer. The sale should be recorded to match revenue and
expense. If this error isn’t corrected, a mismatch will occur because the expense is in this year
but the revenue will be in next year.
c
The $1,500 trash collection bill for the last month of the fiscal year normally arrives before the
end of the month. However, the waste management company didn’t get its bills out on time, so
the expense hasn’t been recorded. What adjusting entry should be made to correct this error?
Trash Collection Expense
$1,500
Accounts Payable
$1,500
This entry records the 12th month of expense for the year. If this entry were not recorded, only
eleven months of trash collection expense would be recorded for the year. Also, the amount
owed to the trash collection company is clearly a liability of the business and should be
included in its accounts payable balance at the end of the year.
d
In the hustle and bustle of the end-of-year accounting activities, the bookkeeper simply forgot
to record the business’s social security taxes on its last payroll in the year. As you may know, a
business employer pays social security taxes equal to the amount withheld from employees’
paychecks. The amount of employer’s social security tax for the last pay period is $29,600.
What adjusting entry should be made to correct this error?
Social Security Tax Expense
$29,600
Social Security Taxes Payable
$29,600
Most businesses put both the social security taxes withheld from employees’ wages and the
equal amount paid by the business in one liability account for social security taxes payable.

Based on its depreciation schedules, the annual depreciation on the business’s machinery is
$420,000. The business uses the straight-line depreciation method. The business recorded a
machinery depreciation expense at the end of each quarter during the year, but no entry has
been made for the fourth and final quarter. What adjusting entry for machinery depreciation
should be recorded at year-end?
Machinery Depreciation
$105,000
Accumulated Depreciation — Machinery
$105,000
Note: By the end of the year, the business had already recorded three quarters of depreciation
on its machinery. In the year-end adjusting entry, only the last quarter of the total annual depre-
ciation expense is recorded.
f
Rather than own the real estate, a business leases its land and buildings. The lease agreement
calls for monthly rents. Does the business record depreciation on this real estate?
No, because there’s no depreciation expense to record. As each lease payment is made, the
business records rent expense, which takes the place of depreciation expense (which would be
recorded if the business owned the building).
g
A bookkeeper who was recently hired by a business recorded the depreciation expense on
delivery trucks for the year as follows:
Depreciation Expense — Delivery Trucks
$215,000
Delivery Trucks
$215,000
Is this entry wrong?
The debit to depreciation expense is correct, but the wrong account is credited. The credit
should be made in the Accumulated Depreciation — Delivery Trucks account, which is the
contra account to the Delivery Trucks asset account.
Standard practice is to report the original cost of fixed assets in the balance sheet and to
deduct the cumulative amount of depreciation from original cost. To have this information
available for preparing the balance sheet, the accumulated depreciation account is credited
when recording depreciation expense.
h
On the last day of the year, a particular piece of equipment that originally cost $87,500 many
years ago was removed from the production line and put on the shipping dock. The equipment
is of no further use to the business and will be hauled away to the junk heap in a few days. The
asset is fully depreciated. What entry should be made for the retirement of the fixed asset?
Accumulated Depreciation — Equipment
$87,500
Equipment
$87,500
When a fixed asset is retired and removed from service, its cost and accumulated depreciation
should be removed from the accounts. The fixed asset is fully depreciated, so the balance in the
accumulated depreciation account is equal to the original cost of the fixed asset. Not making this
entry would inflate the balances of the fixed asset account and of its contra account.
i
A business pays the owner of a patent $500,000 for the right to use the patent for a period of
five years.
a. What entry should be made for the purchase of the patent right?
The entry to record the purchase of the patent is:
Patent
$500,000
Cash
$500,000

b. What adjusting entry should be made one year later?
The entry to record the first year amortization expense on the patent is:
Patent Amortization Expense
$100,000
Patent
$100,000
The business has the right to use the patent for only five years. Therefore, it should amortize
the cost of the patent right over the five-year period. Generally, the straight-line method of allo-
cation is used for amortizing the cost of an intangible asset. So $100,000 expense (1⁄5 of $500,000)
is recorded each year. The amortization is recorded as a direct reduction (credit) in the intangi-
ble asset account.
j
The business signs a ten-year contract with the inventor of a secret process that it will use in
its manufacturing operations. As an incentive to agree to the contract, the business immedi-
ately pays the inventor $1,000,000. In addition, the business agrees to pay the inventor a royalty
equal to five percent of its sales revenue from these products over the next ten years.
a. What entry should be made for the initial payment to the inventor?
The entry to record the purchase of the rights to the secret process is:
Secret Process
$1,000,000
Cash
$1,000,000
b. What adjusting entry should be made one year later?
The entry to record the first year amortization expense on the cost of the secret process is:
Secret Process Amortization Expense
$100,000
Secret Process
$100,000
The purpose of this question is to illustrate that the cost of the intangible asset should be
amortized over the life of the contract to use the secret process. To be more accurate, however,
this is a cost of production. The amortization amount should be charged to the cost of the
products that are manufactured using the secret process. When these products are sold, their
costs are charged to the cost of goods sold expense account. So, the amortization ends up in
the cost of goods sold expense account. Likewise, depreciation on fixed assets that are used in
a company’s manufacturing process is charged to the cost of products manufactured.
k
A business makes almost all credit sales. At the end of the year, the business has $485,000 total
accounts receivable. This ending balance doesn’t include $28,500 specific accounts receivable
that were written off during the period. The business estimates that customers will not pay
$6,500 of the ending balance of its accounts receivable. What year-end adjusting entry is made?
If the business uses the direct write-off method, no adjusting entry is made at the end of the
year. Only the receivables actually written off during the year are included in bad debts
expense. So its bad debts expense for the year is $28,500.
If the business uses the allowance method, the following adjusting entry is made at the end of
the year:
Bad Debts Expense
$6,500
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
$6,500
Its bad debts expense for the year is $35,000 ($28,500 specific accounts written off during the
year + $6,500 recorded in this adjusting entry).

The business has more cash than it needs for day-to-day operations, so the excess cash is
invested in short-term marketable securities that pay interest. During the year, the business
receives interest checks, which it records in the interest income account. At the end of the year,
$48,500 interest has been earned but not yet received. This interest will be included in the inter-
est checks the business receives next year. The business hasn’t recorded this earned interest.
What adjusting entry is made at the end of the year?
The following year-end adjusting entry is made to pick up the additional amount of interest
income that has been earned but not received:
Accrued Interest Receivable
$48,500
Interest Income
$48,500
When the interest income checks are received next year, the bookkeeper has to remember that
$48,500 interest income has already been recorded. Accordingly, when the interest income
checks are received, $48,500 is entered as a credit in the accrued interest receivable asset
account.
m
At the end of the year, the business owes its employees $58,300 for accumulated vacation and
sick pay. This amount will be paid when employees actually take their vacations and time off
for sick leave. No entry has been made for this accrued liability. What adjusting entry is made
at the end of the year?
The year-end adjusting entry for the accumulation of vacation and sick pay is as follows.
Wages and Salaries Expense
$58,300
Accrued Operating Liabilities Payable
$58,300
The titles of the accounts debited and credited in this year-end entry vary from business to
business. For example, a separate expense account for employees’ benefits can be used instead
of debiting all labor costs in one general wages and salaries expense account. And the exact
title of the liability account credited may vary; separate accounts may be used for each specific
liability.

owed to the government will be paid when the business’s income tax return is filed later.
a. What adjusting entry is made at the end of the year?
The year-end adjusting entry to record the full amount of income tax expense for the year is

hasn’t yet come due for payment and that hasn’t been recorded.

a. What adjusting entry is made at the end of the year?
The year-end adjusting entry for unpaid interest expense is:
Interest Expense
$97,500
Accrued Interest Payable
$97,500
b. What is the amount of interest expense reported in its annual income statement?
The interest expense reported in its annual income statement for the year is $612,900, which
is the total of the interest payments during the year plus the amount recorded in the year-end
adjusting entry.
p
At the end of the year, the business counts and inspects its ending inventory of products on hand,
which is stored in its warehouse and retail sales areas. Usually, employees discover some dam-
aged and spoiled products that can’t be sold. This year is no exception. The cost of spoiled and
damaged products that will have to be thrown away is $26,300. What adjusting entry is made?
The business should make the following year-end adjusting entry:
Cost of Goods Sold Expense
$26,300
Inventory
$26,300
Some accountants may disagree about the account I debit in this adjusting entry. Some amount 
of spoilage and damage from handling products is unavoidable and a normal cost of receiving,
moving, storing, and handling products. Therefore, I include this amount in the cost of goods 
sold expense. On the other hand, an unusually high percent of products could be thrown away —
beyond what’s normal for the business. In such a situation, I would record the excess cost as a
special expense, such as loss from damaged products. Regardless of which expense account is
debited, accountants definitely agree that the cost of products thrown out should be recorded to
expense in the year.

The business is organized legally as a partnership and therefore doesn’t pay income tax. 
(A partnership’s annual taxable income or loss is passed through to its partners who pick up
their share of profit or loss in their individual income tax returns.) Year-end adjusting entries
have been recorded and posted, and the business’s revenue and expense accounts are pro-
vided here. What closing entry is recorded?
The following closing entry is recorded.
Sales Revenue
$1,764,500
Cost of Goods Sold Expense
$687,500
Selling & Administrative Expenses
$674,300
Interest Expense

Partners’ Equity

The annual profit of a partnership is allocated among the individual partners’ equity (also
called capital) accounts. In this entry, only one general partners’ equity account is shown.
Generally, partnerships don’t separate between invested capital and retained earnings, as do
corporations.

The purchasing manager of the business has authority to issue purchase orders. He also
inspects shipments as they arrive, approves vendors’ invoices for payment, and mails checks
to the vendors. Do you see any potential problems here?
This business is asking for trouble. Assigning all these different functions to the same person
violates a fundamental tenet of internal control: the separation of duties. Giving the purchasing
manager control over the procurement process from start to finish is dangerous; ideally, a dif-
ferent person should be in charge of each of the steps listed in the question. For example,
someone other than the purchasing manager should inspect shipments as they arrive on the
receiving dock to make sure the items received match up with the items listed on the invoice
from the vendor, and a different person should mail checks to vendors. If I were the boss, I’d
tell the purchasing manager that his time is too valuable to do all these things and that he
should focus on getting better prices.
t
A business doesn’t bother to reconcile its monthly bank statement balance and its cash
account balance, claiming that its bookkeepers have more important things to do and, besides,
the bank never makes a mistake. What do you think?
A business should routinely reconcile its monthly bank statement balance and its cash account
balance. Even if the bank “never” makes an error (hum!), the bookkeeper may make errors in
recording cash receipts and payments. Also, keep in mind that the monthly bank statement
reports checks from customers that have bounced (for insufficient funds) and unusual charges
by the bank that the business may not have recorded as well as regular charges that the busi-
ness may wait to record until it gets its monthly bank statement. In short, the bookkeeper
should make time to do a monthly reconciliation.

Preparing Financial
Statements

In this part . . .
O
ne main purpose of accounting is to prepare the
financial statements of the business. This part
explains the three primary financial statements of every
business: the income statement that reports the profit-
making activities of the business for the period, the bal-
ance sheet that summarizes its financial condition at the
end of the profit period, and the statement of cash flows
for the period.
One innovative feature in this part is Chapter 7, in which 
I explain the connections between sales revenue and
expenses reported in the income statement with their cor-
responding assets and liabilities reported in the balance
sheet. These couplings are very important to understand.
The end result of making profit is not found in the income
statement (even though profit is called the bottom line.)
As you discover, the final resulting place of profit is actu-
ally in the balance sheet.

usiness is profit-motivated. As I explain in The Fast Forward MBA in Finance (Wiley),
profit stimulates innovation; it’s the reward for taking risks; it’s the return on capital
invested in business; it’s compensation for hard work and long hours; it motivates effi-
ciency; it weeds out products and services no longer in demand; it keeps pressure on com-
panies to maintain their quality of customer service and products.
In short, the profit system delivers the highest standard of living in the world. Despite all
this, it’s no secret that many in society have a deep-seated distrust toward our profit-
motivated, free-enterprise, and open-market system — and not entirely without reason.
The job of accountants is to measure profit performance, not to pass judgment on its moral-
ity. Yet, accountants shouldn’t behave like the three monkeys who see no evil, speak no evil,
and hear no evil. If a business is acting illegally, the last thing it wants to do is record a liabil-
ity because of the likelihood of losing a major lawsuit or having to pay a huge fine because of
its illegal activities. The chief accountant has to decide whether to be part of the conspiracy
to conceal the illegal activities or to leave the business.
This chapter explains the effects of profit or loss on financial condition and how profit 
and loss performance is reported outside the business in the income statement. The term
“income statement” generally means the external income statement reported by a business
to its shareowners and lenders. (In Part III of this book, I discuss internal profit reports used
by a business’s managers; internal management profit reports include much more detailed
and confidential information than external income statements.)
Externally reported income statements are bound by authoritative financial reporting stan-
dards for measuring and reporting profit. These rules are called generally accepted accounting
principles, or GAAP for short. Business profit measurement and reporting shouldn’t deviate
from these standards in any significant respect. Otherwise, the income statement could be
judged as misleading and possibly fraudulent.
Understanding the Nature of Profit
Profit doesn’t have just one universal meaning or definition. One concept of profit is to buy
low and sell high. This definition applies to investing in stocks and real estate, but it’s not a
good definition for business profit. Another concept of profit is an increase in the market
value of an asset. Accounting for business profit ignores market value increases of operating
assets. Except for investment companies, hedge funds, and mutual funds, businesses don’t
earn profit by holding assets that appreciate in value.

Most businesses earn profit through an ongoing process of selling products and services for
prices that provide revenue higher than the expense of providing the products and services.
Business profit is the residual, or the amount remaining after deducting expenses from rev-
enue. To make profit, a business needs to raise capital (generally money) to invest in operat-
ing assets that are used in its profit-making activities. These assets aren’t held for sale or for
market value appreciation. The business’s sources of capital expect a return on their capital,
and interest is paid on money loaned to the business. The profit remaining after paying inter-
est to lenders and income tax to the government accrues to the benefit of the shareowners of
the business.
Of course, a business may pursue profit in many other directions — from trading in pork
belly futures to real estate speculation. But this chapter focuses on making profit the old-
fashioned way — making sales and controlling expenses. The income statement I discuss in
this chapter is for the standard model of a business that sells products and services.
Profit is a calculated number equal to the difference between sales revenue and expenses.
Sales revenue is on one side of the scale, expenses are on the other side, and profit is the
measure of how much the revenue side outweighs the expense side. To locate profit, you
must trace the effects of revenue and expenses.
Suppose a business collects cash for all its sales and pays cash for all its expenses during 
the year. You need look to only one place — its cash account — to find the business’s profit.
However, a business may make credit sales and not collect cash from all its sales during the
year. Furthermore, the typical business doesn’t pay all its expenses during the year and pays
some expenses before the start of the year. In summary, sales and expenses affect several
assets, including cash and liabilities.
To follow the trail of profit, keep the following in mind:
 Sales Revenue = Asset Increase or Liability Decrease
 An Expense = Asset Decrease or Liability Increase

Part II: Preparing Financial Statements 
Q.
During the year, Business A’s assets
increase $3,000,000, and its liabilities
increase $400,000 as the result of its profit-
making activities. During the year, Business
B’s assets increase $2,700,000, and its liabil-
ities increase $100,000 as the result of its
profit-making activities. During the year,
Business C’s assets increase $2,000,000,
and its liabilities decrease $600,000 as the
result of its profit-making activities. None
of these three businesses distributed any
part of their annual profit to their share-
owners during the year. What is the annual
profit of each business?
A.
All three businesses earn the same profit
for the year: $2,600,000. In Chapter 1, I
explain that the accounting equation can
be stated as follows:
Assets – Liabilities = Owners’ equity
Profit increases the owners’ equity of a
business, which means that the changes 
in assets and liabilities have the effect of
increasing owners’ equity. For each busi-
ness in this scenario, owners’ equity
improves $2,600,000, which is the amount
of profit for the year.

Choosing the Income Statement Format
The bottom line profit (or loss) in an income statement draws the most attention, but the
income statement is really about sales revenue and expenses. A business can’t make profit
without sales and expenses. Therefore, the income statement reports sales revenue and
expenses.
An income statement reports three basic items of information, in the following order:
 Sales Revenue
 Expenses
 Profit
Income statements are reported in two basic formats:
 Multi-step format: This format typically presents four measures of profit — gross
margin, operating earnings, earnings before income tax, and net income. One revenue
line and four profit lines are presented. One purpose of this format is to disclose gross
margin, which is a key determinant in the bottom-line profit performance of businesses
that sell products. Any slippage in gross margin as a percent of sales revenue is viewed
with alarm.
 Single-step format: In this format, all expenses are added and their total is deducted
from sales revenue. Unlike the multi-step format, there’s only one profit line, which is
bottom-line net income.
Figure 5-1 is an illustration of the multi-step format. Reading this income statement is like
walking down stairs, one step at a time.
The single-step income statement format for the same business is shown in Figure 5-2. In
actual practice, you see countless variations of these two basic income statement formats.

Deciding on Disclosure in the Income Statement
After a business decides on the format for reporting its income statement (multi-step or
single-step; see the preceding section), the next main decision concerns how much informa-
tion to disclose about its expenses. Public companies are subject to financial disclosure rules
issued by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A publicly owned
business has no choice but to abide by these rules. Otherwise, trading in its stock shares
could be suspended by the SEC — the kiss of death for a public company.
Income statement disclosure standards for nonpublic businesses (that is, those not subject
to the SEC’s jurisdiction) are surprisingly vague and permissive. Generally accepted account-
ing standards (GAAP) say little about how much information should be disclosed about
expenses in the income statement. Generally speaking, businesses that sell products report
their cost of goods sold expenses, and almost all businesses report their interest and income
tax expenses. But, it’s much more difficult to generalize about the disclosure of other
expenses.
Figures 5-1 and 5-2 disclose only one conglomerate operating expense: Selling and General
Expenses. Some businesses disclose only this expense because they’re very stingy about
revealing any more detail about their operating expenses. Other businesses report five or ten
operating expenses in their income statements.

In deciding how much expense disclosure should be included in income statements, busi-
nesses make three main considerations:
 Confidentiality: Many businesses don’t want to reveal the compensation of the officers
of the business, for example. They argue that this information is private and personal.
 Materiality: Most businesses don’t see any point in reporting expense information
that’s relatively insignificant and would only clutter the income statement.
 Practicality: Businesses limit the income statement contents to what fits on one page.
A business can put additional detail about expenses in the footnotes to its financial
statements, but many argue that shareowners and lenders have only so much time to
read financial statements and putting too much information in their financial reports is
counterproductive.
104
Part II: Preparing Financial Statements 
Q.
Assume that you are one of the major
shareowners of the private business whose
annual income statement is shown in
Figure 5-1. You aren’t a manager of the busi-
ness or on its board of directors, but as an
outside investor, you’re vitally interested in
how the business is doing financially. So
you carefully read the business’s financial
statements, especially its income state-
ment. You depend on the business making
a profit in order to pay dividends from
profit to its shareowners. Are you satisfied
with the extent of expense disclosure in
the income statement? Do you want the
income statement to report one or more of
the following expenses?
• Compensation of officers
• Salaries and wages of employees
• Repairs and maintenance
• Bad debts
• Rents
• Taxes and licenses
• Depreciation
• Advertising
• Pension and profit-sharing plans
• Employee benefit plans
A.
In all likelihood, the business keeps
accounts for these expenses because they
have to be reported in its annual federal
income tax return. So the information is
available and could be reported in the busi-
ness’s income statement. When I served on
the board of directors of a local bank and
reviewed loan applications from our busi-
ness customers, I saw income statements
that reported all these expenses. On the
other hand, I saw many income statements
that didn’t disclose these expenses.
If I were a major outside shareowner in this business, I would request that, either in the
income statement itself or in the footnotes to the financial statements, information be
reported about four expenses: repairs and maintenance, advertising, pension and profit-
sharing plans, and employee benefit plans. Why these four? Repairs and maintenance
expense can be manipulated by management to push profit up or down for the year.
Advertising is a very discretionary expense that I’d want to compare to sales revenue.
Pension and profit-sharing plans and employee benefit plans can be very large encum-
brances on a business.

8.
Some years ago, businesses in the cosmetic
industry did not report sales revenue and
cost of goods sold expense. Their income
statements started with the gross margin
line, and their gross margins were a very
large percent of sales revenue (over 70 per-
cent). The companies argued that if their
customers found out that their gross mar-
gins were so fat, many would refuse to pay
such high prices for lipstick, rouge, and so
on. Is this a legitimate reason for a busi-
ness with high gross profit margins to not
report sales revenue and cost of goods
sold expense?
Solve It
Examining How Sales and Expenses 
Change Assets and Liabilities
In a financial report, the income statement may seem like a tub standing on its own feet, dis-
connected from the balance sheet and the statement of cash flows. Nothing is further from
the truth. The three financial statements are interdependent and interconnected. For exam-
ple, if sales revenue or one of the expenses had been just $10 different than the amount
reported in the income statement, a $10 difference would appear somewhere in the balance
sheet and statement of cash flows.
As you know, an income statement reports sales revenue, expenses, and profit or loss. But an
income statement doesn’t report how sales revenue and expenses change the financial con-
dition of the business. For example, in Figure 5-1, $26,000,000 sales revenue is reported in the
annual income statement of a business. The business also reports $24,310,000 total expenses
for the year. How did the sales revenue and expenses change its financial condition? The
income statement doesn’t say.
Business managers rely on their accountants to explain how sales and expenses change the
assets and liabilities of their businesses. Business lenders and shareowners also need to
understand these effects in order to make sense of financial statements.
Suppose you’re the chief accountant of the business whose income statement is presented 
in Figure 5-1. The president asks you to explain the financial effects of sales revenue and
expenses reported in its latest annual income statement at the next meeting of its board of
directors. To help organize your thoughts for the presentation, you decide to prepare sum-
mary sales revenue and expense journal entries for the year. Based on your analysis, you pre-
pare the following summary journal entries for sales revenue and for each of the four
expenses reported in the income statement.

Sales Revenue:
Cash
$25,000,000
Accounts Receivable
$1,000,000
Sales Revenue
$26,000,000
The business makes credit sales. When recording a credit sale, the asset account accounts
receivable is debited. When the customer pays, accounts receivable is credited. The business
collected $25,000,000 from customers. Therefore, its accounts receivable balance increased
$1,000,000.
Cost of Goods Sold Expense:
Cost of Goods Sold Expense
$14,300,000
Inventory
$2,000,000
Cash
$14,500,000
Accounts Payable
$1,800,000
The business purchases $16,300,000 of products during the year, and its cost of goods sold
was $14,300,000. So, its inventory increased $2,000,000. It didn’t pay for all its $16,300,000 of
purchases. Its accounts payable for inventory purchases increased $1,800,000. Therefore,
cash outlay for products during the year was $14,500,000.
Selling and General Expenses:
Selling and General Expenses
$8,700,000
Prepaid Expenses
$300,000
Cash
$6,900,000
Accounts Payable
$850,000
Accrued Expenses Payable
$725,000
Accumulated Depreciation
$525,000
Selling and General Expenses is a somewhat complicated entry because operating expenses
involve several balance sheet accounts. The business added $300,000 to its prepaid expenses
balance during the year. It recorded $525,000 depreciation expense for the year, as you see in
the credit to accumulated depreciation. (Depreciation expense is included in the selling and
general expenses amount reported in its income statement.) Not all expenses were paid for
by the end of the year; unpaid expenses caused $850,000 increase in accounts payable and
$725,000 increase in accrued expenses payable.
Interest Expense:
Interest Expense
$400,000
Cash
$350,000
Accrued Expenses Payable
$50,000
106
Part II: Preparing Financial Statements 

The business paid $350,000 interest during the year. The amount of unpaid interest at year-
end increased $50,000. A general liability account for accrued expenses is shown in this
entry. (The business may credit a more specific account, such as accrued interest payable.)
Income Tax Expense:
Income Tax Expense
$910,000
Cash
$830,000
Accrued Expenses Payable
$80,000
At the end of last year, the business didn’t owe any income tax. During the year, it made
$830,000 installment payments toward its estimated income tax (as required by law). Based
on the final determination of its income tax for the year, the business still owes $80,000,
which will be paid when its return is filed. The general liability account for accrued expenses
is shown in this entry. (The business may credit a more specific account, such as income tax
payable.)
These five summary entries aren’t actual journal entries recorded by a business; they simply
help summarize the effects of sales and expenses on the assets and liabilities of the business.
Also, I should point out that to develop the information for these entries, the accountant has
to analyze the balance sheet accounts affected by sales and expenses, which takes time.
107
Chapter 5: The Effects and Reporting of Profit
Q.
From the five summary journal entries for sales revenue and expenses for the year, can you deter-
mine the cash flow from profit (that is, the net cash increase or decrease from its profit-making
activities for the year)?
A.
Yes, indeed you can. Each of the summary entries involves a debit (increase) or credit (decrease)
to the cash account. The net effect on cash from its sales revenue and expenses for the year is
summarized as follows:
Sales revenue
$25,000,000
Cost of Goods Sold Expense
($14,500,000)
Selling and General Expenses
($6,900,000)
Interest Expense
($350,000)
Income Tax Expense
  ($830,000)
Net Cash Increase
$2,420,000
Note: The $2,420,000 net cash increase is labeled “cash flow from operating activities” in the state-
ment of cash flows. (For more on this financial statement see Chapter 8.)

payment will be refunded to the business.

Summing Up the Manifold Effects of Profit
Making sales and incurring expenses cause a multitude of effects on the assets and lia-
bilities of a business. In other words, making profit causes many changes in the finan-
cial condition of a business. It would be convenient if a $1 profit caused a $1 cash
increase and nothing more, but the effects of making profit are much broader and
reach throughout the balance sheet.
The journal entries in the preceding section summarize the effects of sales and
expenses on a business’s assets and liabilities. Figure 5-3 shows these changes in T
accounts for the assets and liabilities. As you probably know, T accounts aren’t the
official, formal accounts of a business. Rather, T accounts are like scratch paper that
accountants use to analyze and “think out” the effects of transactions. A T account has
two columns: debits are always put in the left column and credits in the right column.
The rules for debits and credits are explained in Chapter 3.
In Figure 5-3, I use seven asset and liability accounts to illustrate the recording of sales
revenue and expenses for the year. Even a relatively small business keeps 100 or more
asset and liability accounts. However, the seven asset and liability accounts in the
example are sufficient to illustrate the effects of sales revenue and expenses on the
financial condition of a business.
In order to help you understand what profit consists of, I collapse the changes in
assets and liabilities caused by sales and expenses shown in Figure 5-3 into one com-
prehensive journal entry that shows the diverse effects of making profit. In this entry,
the $1,690,000 profit for the year is shown as an increase in the retained earnings
owners’ equity account.

Q.
This comprehensive journal entry for the asset and liability effects of making profit “speaks” to an
accountant, who’s familiar with journal entries and debits and credits. Translate this journal entry
into plain English, giving an explanation that non-accounting business managers, lenders, and
investors can understand.
A.
A good way of explaining the diverse effects of profit on assets and liabilities is to prepare a sum-
mary of the changes in balance sheet accounts affected.

Net Worth Increase From Profit

Profit improves the net worth of a business. Net worth, another name for the owners’ equity,
equals total assets minus total liabilities. In this example, the business makes a profit, and
the effect on the balance sheet is that assets increase more than liabilities, which is the typi-
cal profit effect. On the other hand, assets could remain relatively flat and liabilities could
decrease. (Although it isn’t very common, profit could consist of a decrease in liabilities
more than the decrease in assets.)

13. The effects from sales and expenses for the year just ended for a business were as follows:
Sales revenue was $15,700,000; the business collected $13,900,000 cash from customers, and
accounts receivable increased $1,800,000.
The cost of products sold during the year was $9,800,000, and the business added $500,000 of
products to inventory. It didn’t pay for all $10,300,000 in purchases. Its accounts payable for
inventory purchases increased $250,000.
Selling and general expenses were $4,860,000. The business added $125,000 to its prepaid
expenses balance during the year. It recorded a $145,000 depreciation expense for the year.
(Depreciation is included in the selling and general expenses amount reported in its income
statement.) Not all expenses were paid for by the end of the year; unpaid expenses caused a
$150,000 increase in accounts payable and a $225,000 increase in accrued expenses payable.
The business paid $200,000 interest during the year. The amount of unpaid interest at year-end
increased $25,000. (Use the general liability account accrued expenses payable.)
The business is organized legally as a limited liability company (LLC) and has elected not to pay
income tax. Its taxable income for the year is passed through to its shareowners, who include
their respective portions of the business’s taxable income in their individual income tax returns.

Answers to Problems on the Effects 
and Reporting of Profit
The following are the answers to the practice questions presented earlier in this chapter.
a
A business reports $346,000 net income (profit) for the year just ended. Determine two valid
scenarios for changes in its assets and liabilities resulting from its profit for the year.
The simplest scenario is that assets increase $346,000 and liabilities remain the same (zero
change). Another valid scenario is a situation in which assets increase $346,000 more than lia-
bilities increase; for example, assets increase $846,000 and liabilities increase $500,000. An
unusual but valid scenario would be that assets remain the same (zero change) and liabilities
decrease $346,000. The key point is that if profit is $346,000, then net worth (assets minus liabili-
ties) increases $346,000.
b
A business reports $3,800,000 loss for the year just ended. Determine two valid scenarios for
changes in its assets and liabilities resulting from its loss for the year.
The simplest scenario is that assets decrease $3,800,000 and liabilities remain the same (zero
change). Another valid scenario is a situation in which assets decrease $3,800,000 more than
liabilities decrease; for example, assets decrease $6,800,000 and liabilities decrease $3,000,000.
An unusual but valid scenario would be that assets remain the same (zero change) and liabili-
ties increase $3,800,000. The key point is that if loss is $3,800,000, then net worth (assets minus
liabilities) decreases $3,800,000.
c
A business reports $5,250,000 net income for the year just ended. In its statement of cash flows
for the year, the business reports that its cash flow from operating activities (from its profit 
for the year) is $4,650,000. In other words, its cash balance increased $4,650,000 from its profit-
making activities for the year. Determine two valid scenarios for changes in assets other than
cash and in liabilities that result from its profit for the year.
$5,250,000 profit less the $4,650,000 cash increase from profit leaves $600,000 to be explained.
One asset (cash) increased $4,650,000, so you have to figure out what happened to other assets
and to liabilities. One valid scenario is that assets other than cash increased $1,600,000 and 
liabilities increased $1,000,000. If liabilities remained the same (zero change), then assets other
than cash would have increased $600,000. It’s possible, though not very likely, that assets other
than cash remained the same (zero change) and liabilities decreased $600,000.
d
A business reports $836,000 loss for the year just ended. In its statement of cash flows for the
year, the business reports that its cash flow from operating activities (from its loss for the year)
is a negative $675,000. In other words, its cash balance decreased $675,000 from its profit-
making activities for the year. Determine two valid scenarios for changes in assets other than
cash and in liabilities resulting from its loss for the year.
Not all the loss is accounted for by the cash decrease. The $836,000 loss compared with the
$675,000 cash decrease leaves $161,000 to be explained. The simplest scenario is that liabilities
remained the same (zero change) and assets other than cash decreased $161,000. The reverse
of this scenario is that assets other than cash remained the same (zero change) and liabilities
increased $161,000. I wouldn’t be surprised if assets other than cash increased even though the
business suffered a loss for the year, in which case liabilities would have increased $161,000
more than assets other than cash.

A business’s income statement doesn’t disclose its advertising expenses for the year. Give an
argument for not disclosing this expense, and give an argument for disclosing this expense.
The main argument for not disclosing advertising expense is that the business may give up a
competitive advantage by doing so. The thinking is that it’s best if a business’s competitors
don’t know how much it spends on advertising. (Of course, a business may not know how
much its competitors spend on advertising, either.) Another argument rests on the general
grounds of confidentiality; many private businesses believe that they have rights of privacy
about their financial affairs.
One main argument in favor of disclosing an advertising expense is that this particular expense
is very discretionary and arbitrary in nature. A business could be spending far too much on
advertising with little payoff. Conversely, a business could be spending very little on advertis-
ing with the result that its sales are anemic. Many lenders and investors argue that they need

to know how much a business spends on advertising so they can compare this expense against
sales revenue. Also, how much a business spends on advertising says a lot about its general
aggressiveness and strategy. This expense is considered a good indicator of a business’s com-
petitive strategy.
h
Some years ago businesses in the cosmetic industry did not report sales revenue and cost of
goods sold expense. Their income statements started with the gross margin line, and their
gross margins were a very large percent of sales revenue (over 70 percent). The companies
argued that if their customers found out that their gross margins were so fat, many would
refuse to pay such high prices for lipstick, rouge, and so on. Is this a legitimate reason for a
business with high gross profit margins to not report sales revenue and cost of goods sold
expense?
I remember reading these income statements many years ago and being truly shocked. Today,
financial reporting standards for businesses that sell products require that they report sales
revenue, cost of goods sold expense, and gross profit (margin) in their income statements. In
contrast, many businesses don’t sell products, or the products they sell are incidental and sec-
ondary to the sale of services, which is the main source of their sales revenue. Airlines and
movie theaters are examples of such businesses. Service-oriented businesses generally don’t
report cost of goods sold expense and, therefore, don’t report gross profit. Many report a “cost
of sales” expense in their income statements, but this expense usually isn’t deducted from sales
revenue, and gross profit isn’t reported.
i
Refer to the summary sales revenue entry in the section “Examining How Sales and Expenses
Change Assets and Liabilities.” Assume that accounts receivable increased $500,000 instead of
the $1,000,000 increase in that entry. Prepare the summary journal entry for sales revenue.
The summary sales revenue entry for this scenario is:
Cash
$25,500,000
Accounts Receivable
$500,000
Sales Revenue
$26,000,000
j
Refer to the summary cost of goods sold expense entry in the section “Examining How Sales
and Expenses Change Assets and Liabilities.” Assume that inventory decreased $500,000 during
the year because the business sold more products than it purchased during the year. And
assume that accounts payable decreased $250,000 during the year because the business paid
more of its purchase liabilities than it bought on credit. Prepare the summary journal entry for
cost of goods sold expense.
The summary cost of goods sold expense entry for this scenario is:
Cost of Goods Sold Expense
$14,300,000
Inventory
$500,000
Cash
$14,050,000
Accounts Payable
$250,000
In the summary entry for cost of goods sold expense in the example, cash decreased $14,500,000,
whereas in this scenario cash decreased $14,050,000, which is a $450,000 smaller cash outlay for
the year. Why? Instead of adding to inventory, which required more purchases of goods than the
goods that were sold, the business allowed its inventory to fall, which meant that its purchases
were less than the goods sold and produced a $2,500,000 reduction in cash outlay. In the example,
accounts payable increased $1,800,000, but in this scenario, this liability was decreased $250,000.
This difference means additional cash outlay of $2,050,000. The net cash difference, therefore, is
$450,000. The inventory difference reduced cash outlay $2,500,000, and the accounts payable dif-
ference increased cash outlay $2,050,000.
115
Chapter 5: The Effects and Reporting of Profit

k
Refer to the summary selling and general expenses entry in the section “Examining How Sales
and Expenses Change Assets and Liabilities.” Assume that prepaid expenses didn’t change
during the year. The amounts for depreciation expense and the increases in accounts payable
and accrued expenses payable are the same as in the summary journal entry. Selling and gen-
eral expenses are $8,700,000, the same as in the example. Prepare the summary journal entry
for selling and general expenses.
The summary selling and general expenses entry for this scenario is:
Selling and General Expenses
$8,700,000
Cash
$6,600,000
Accounts Payable
$850,000
Accrued Expenses Payable
$725,000
Accumulated Depreciation
$525,000
This entry doesn’t have any debit or credit to prepaid expenses (an asset account) because its
balance didn’t change in this scenario. In the example, the business increased its prepaid
expenses $300,000, so in this scenario, cash outlay is $300,000 lower because the business
didn’t increase its prepaid expenses.
l
Refer to the summary income tax expense entry for the business example in the section
“Examining How Sales and Expenses Change Assets and Liabilities.” Assume that the business
overpaid its income tax for the year. The total of installment payments during the year was
$50,000 more than its $910,000 income tax for the year. The overpayment will be refunded to
the business. Prepare the summary journal entry for income tax expense.
The summary income tax expense entry for this scenario is:
Income Tax Expense
$910,000
Income Tax Refund Receivable
$50,000
Cash
$960,000
A business may overestimate its income tax for the year and pay more than the amount owed,
but businesses try to avoid this practice because they would rather have the use of the money
during the year.

expenses balance during the year. It recorded a $145,000 depreciation expense for the year.
(Depreciation is included in the selling and general expenses amount reported in its income
statement.) Not all expenses were paid for by the end of the year. Unpaid expenses caused a
$150,000 increase in accounts payable and a $225,000 increase in accrued expenses payable.
The business paid $200,000 interest during the year. The amount of unpaid interest at year-
end increased $25,000. (Use the general liability account accrued expenses payable.)
The business is organized legally as a limited liability company (LLC) and has elected not to

In this scenario, net worth decreased $875,000 because liabilities increased $1,430,000 and assets
increased only $555,000. This unfavorable difference is the essence of a loss. Notice that even
though the business suffered a loss for the year, its cash balance decreased far less than the
amount of loss. The cash decrease is relatively low because the business avoided cash payments
due to the relatively large increases in its accounts payable and accrued expenses payable.

Reporting Financial Condition 
in the Balance Sheet
In This Chapter
 Breaking down the balance sheet
 Building and filling out a balance sheet
 Valuing assets in balance sheets
Your rich aunt just left you a small fortune, and you’ve always wanted to own and
manage a business. Well, wouldn’t you know? The owners of a reputable business in
your hometown want to sell out. It’s a privately owned corporation, and the shareowners
offer to sell all their stock shares to you. You ask to see the business’s latest annual financial
report, but before the present owners hand over this information, they ask you to sign a
confidentiality agreement. This contract requires that if you decide not to buy the business,
you must keep confidential all the information in the financial report. You may not divulge
anything you learn from the financial report. You agree and sign the agreement.
The annual financial report of a business includes four essential elements:
 Income statement for the year just ended
 Balance sheet at the close of business on the last day of the year
 Statement of cash flows for the year just ended
 Footnotes that supplement and are an integral part of the financial statements
The financial statements of a private business may or may not be audited by an independent
CPA. An audit opinion adds credibility to the financial statements but doesn’t come cheap.
So you study the annual income statement of the business you’re interested in purchasing.
All the examples and questions in this chapter are based on the following information for this
business: The company reports $12,000,000 sales revenue and $11,400,000 total expenses for
the year, which equal 95 percent of sales revenue. So net income is $600,000 for the year, or 5
percent of sales revenue. In your opinion, its profit performance is satisfactory for a com-
pany in this line of business. You now turn your attention to its balance sheet, which is a sum-
mary of the business’s assets and liabilities and, as such, provides a comprehensive picture
of the business’s financial condition.
Getting Started on the Balance Sheet
Satisfactory profit performance doesn’t guarantee that the financial condition of the business
is satisfactory. In fact, the business could have serious financial problems even though it’s
earning profit. It may have too little cash and assets that can be converted into cash soon

enough to pay its short-term liabilities. It could be operating at the mercy of its creditors.
Conversely, the business may be sitting on a hoard of cash. You have to look in the balance
sheet to find out what’s really going on financially.
The balance sheet is also called the statement of financial condition, which better indicates its
nature and purposes. This financial statement presents a summary of the assets and the lia-
bilities of a business. Liabilities are claims against the assets of the business; they arise from
unpaid purchases and expenses and from borrowing money. The readers of a balance sheet
compare the liabilities of the business against its assets and judge whether the business will
be able to pay its liabilities on time.
The total assets of a business should be more than its total liabilities, of course. The excess
of assets over liabilities equals the owners’ equity of the business. Liabilities have definite due
dates for payment, but owners have no such claims on the business. Owners’ equity is in the
business for the long haul. By majority vote, the owners can decide to dissolve the business,
liquidate all its assets, pay off all liabilities, and return what’s left to the owners. But individ-
ual owners can’t call up the business and ask for some of their equity to be paid out to them.
In short, owners’ equity is the permanent capital base of the business.
A business corporation reports two sources of owners’ equity:
 The total amount of capital its owners invested in the business
 The accumulated amount of profit earned and retained by the business
In contrast, business partnerships, limited liability companies, and sole proprietorships typi-
cally report just one total amount for owners’ equity.
Assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity accounts aren’t intermingled in the balance sheet.
Assets are presented in one grouping, liabilities in another, and owners’ equity in a third.
Balance sheets typically report five to ten assets, five to ten liabilities, and two, three, or four
owners’ equity accounts. (These are rough averages, I should mention.)
The balance sheet of the business you’re thinking of buying reports these three basic groups:
total assets equal $8,000,000, total liabilities equal $4,800,000, and total owners’ equity equals
$3,200,000 at the end of its most recent year. Using printing option terminology that appears 
in almost all programs, the most common format, or layout, of the balance sheet is landscape
(horizontal). The following is the company’s balance sheet presented in the landscape layout:
Many businesses use the portrait (vertical) format instead of the landscape (horizontal)
format. One advantage of the portrait format is that it allows a business to keep its balance
sheet on one page in its financial report, whereas the landscape format may require a busi-
ness to put its balance sheet on two facing pages in its annual financial report. The following
is the company’s balance sheet presented in the portrait format:

Q.
The large majority of businesses use either
the horizontal or vertical formats for
reporting their balance sheets. However,
now and then, you see a third format in
which total liabilities are subtracted from
total assets to determine owners’ equity.
The following shows this alternative format
for the business example:

sheet format?

A.
Personally, I like this third format because
it makes clear that liabilities have a first, or
senior, claim on the assets of the business
and that owners get what’s left over. After
paying liabilities, the owners of a business
could end up holding an empty bag.

Building a Balance Sheet
A brand-spanking-new business starts with a blank balance sheet. It builds up its balance
sheet over time with three basic types of transactions:
 Financing activities: Includes the investment of capital in the business by its owners,
the return of some capital to owners (which may happen from time to time), and distri-
butions from profit (if the business decides to make such distributions)
 Investing activities: Includes the purchase and construction of long-lived assets used
in the operations of the business, the purchase of intangible assets used in manufactur-
ing and making sales, and the disposal of operating assets when they’re no longer
needed or are replaced
 Operating activities: Includes the profit-making activities of the business, including
sales, expenses, and other income and losses
In Chapter 5, I explain how sales and expenses change the financial condition of the business.
In fact, a good part of its balance sheet is driven by the profit-making transactions of the
business. Before a business begins its profit-making activities, it needs to raise capital and
invest capital in long-term operating assets. These financing and investing activities are the
place to start in building a balance sheet.

Q.
Several investors come together to start a
new business. They raise $1,000,000 and
invest this sum in the business. The busi-
ness issues 10,000 shares of capital stock
to them. The business borrows $1,500,000
from a bank on the basis of a long-term
interest-bearing note payable. The busi-
ness purchases various long-term operat-
ing assets (fixed assets) for a total cost of
$2,000,000. It’s now ready to begin hiring
employees, manufacturing products, and
making sales. Prepare the company’s bal-
ance sheet after these initial financing and
investing activities. Use the landscape

tial financing and investing activities is as

Read this entry as follows. The $800,000
cost of manufacturing the first batch of
products was provided by borrowing
$500,000, by purchasing $225,000 raw 
materials on credit, by $15,000 deprecia-
tion, and by spending down cash $60,000.
The business realized that it didn’t have
enough cash to pay for its first production
run, so it borrowed an additional $500,000
from its bank on the basis of a short-term
note payable. Because it made purchases
on credit for the raw materials needed for
manufacturing products, accounts payable
has a balance of $225,000. The cash bal-
ance is $60,000 lower compared with its
balance immediately after the initial financ-
ing and investing transactions ($500,000
balance before – $440,000 balance after =
$60,000 decrease).
To have products available for sale, the business had to first manufacture the products. The
cost of manufacturing its first batch of products was $800,000, which is in the inventory asset
account. The business recorded depreciation on its fixed assets (property, plant, and equip-
ment) because these resources were used in the manufacturing process. The business
recorded $15,000 depreciation, which is included in the cost of products manufactured.

Fleshing Out the Balance Sheet
The most recent balance sheet of the business you’re considering buying is presented
in Figure 6-1. The first few transactions of the business that I explain earlier in the
chapter (see the example question in the section “Building a Balance Sheet”) took
place some years ago. Since then, the business has grown and prospered.
What does the balance sheet in Figure 6-1 tell you about the business? In fact, it tells
you a lot. You know that the business sells on credit because it reports the accounts
receivable asset, and you know that it sells products, the cost of which is reported in
the inventory asset. Because it reports prepaid expenses, you know that the business
pays some of its expenses in advance, and the report of accrued expenses payable lia-
bility indicates that it delays paying some expenses. Also, you can tell that the busi-
ness buys on credit because it reports the accounts payable liability.
The balance sheet reveals that the business borrows money, which is evident in its
short-term and long-term notes payable liabilities. It has invested $4,800,000 in long-
term operating assets, and over the years, it has depreciated $1,400,000 of the cost of
these assets. According to the balance sheet, the owners invested $1,000,000 in the
business for which they received 10,000 shares of capital stock. And the business has
retained $2,200,000 of its cumulative net income over the years. Did you get all that
from reading the balance sheet? If not, read it again!

The following questions are based on the balance sheet details outlined earlier in this section.
Q.
Does the balance sheet shown in Figure 6-1
report the current replacement costs of the
business’s fixed assets (which are labeled
“Property, Plant & Equipment” in the bal-
ance sheet)? Also, does the balance sheet
indicate which depreciation methods the
business uses to depreciate its fixed
assets?
A.
The short answer to the first question is
no, balance sheets don’t report current
replacement cost values of fixed assets.
Indeed, the business probably hasn’t taken
the time and troubles to estimate these
replacement costs because it isn’t planning
to replace its fixed assets. The answer to
the second question is a little more
involved. This business, like most busi-
nesses, doesn’t disclose its depreciation
methods in the balance sheet itself, but it
discloses depreciation methods in the foot-
notes to the financial statements. (You
have to take my word for it because this
example doesn’t present the footnotes to
the business’s financial statements.)

The balance sheet in Figure 6-1 separates current assets from other assets and separates cur-
rent liabilities from other liabilities. Financial reporting standards require this classification of
assets and liabilities.
 Current assets are cash and assets that will be converted into cash during one operat-
ing cycle, which is the time it takes to manufacture products, to hold the products until
they’re sold, and to collect the receivables from sales. (Prepaid expenses are also
included in current assets because the business uses cash to prepay these costs.) This
“from cash back to cash” cycle can be very short, such as a month or so, or it may be
relatively long, such as six months or more. Retailers generally have short operating
cycles, and manufacturers have long operating cycles.
 Current liabilities include those that will be paid within one operating cycle, which
mainly are accounts payable and accrued expenses payable. Also, notes payable and
any other liabilities that will be paid within one year from the balance sheet date are
included in current liabilities. The subtotals of current assets and current liabilities
appear in a balance sheet so that the reader can compare these two amounts. Dividing
current assets by current liabilities gives the current ratio.
Traditionally, it has been assumed that the current ratio should be at least 2.00 to 1.00,
although this minimum has never become a hard-and-fast rule. But if the current ratio dips
below 1.00 to 1.00, alarm bells are certain to go off. In fact, many argue that the ratio of cash
and cash equivalents (such as short-term marketable investments) divided by current liabili-
ties should be at least 1.00 to 1.00. This is called the quick ratio.

wasn’t actually received and deposited in
its bank account until after the end of the
year. Why do think the business may have
done this?
Solve It
The following questions draw on the business whose balance sheet appears in Figure 6-1.
Q.
Referring to the balance sheet in Figure 6-1,
how would you assess the short-run sol-
vency of the business? (Solvency refers to
the ability of a business to pay its liabilities
on time.)
A.
The current ratio of the business is 1.64 to
1.00 ($4,600,000 current assets ÷ $2,800,000
current liabilities = 1.64). In other words,
for $1.00 of current liabilities, the business
has $1.64 of current assets. The question is
whether this ratio is high enough to “guar-
antee” the short-run solvency of the busi-
ness, or whether there is a serious risk that
the business may not be able to pay its
short-term (current) liabilities when they
come due for payment.
I doubt if the company’s bank or shareown-
ers would be upset about its 1.64 to 1.00
current ratio. The business’s quick ratio 
is only .54 to 1.00 ($1,500,000 cash ÷
$2,800,000 current liabilities = .54 to 1.00).
The company’s lender (its bank) will
decide whether or not this is a major
impediment when it comes time to renew
its short-term loan to the business.
Although the business’s “credit score” (as
measured by its current and quick ratios)
isn’t on the high side, I think that its credi-
tors wouldn’t be worried about the sol-
vency of the business in this example. On
the other hand, the creditors probably
would keep a close eye on the business to
make sure that things don’t take a turn for
the worse.

This chapter focuses on the balance sheet of a business that sells products (see Figure 6-1). I
make only a fleeting comment early in the chapter about the annual sales revenue and profit
of the business, which, as you know, are reported in its income statement. To recap, its sales
revenue for the year just ended is $12,000,000, and the business earned $600,000 bottom-line
profit for the year. At this point, you can compare the revenue size of the business with its
asset size.
The ratio of annual sales revenue to total assets, called the asset turnover ratio, varies from
industry to industry. Many businesses are capital intensive, which means that they need a 
lot of assets to make sales. For example, companies that sell electricity make huge invest-
ments in electric power generating plants. Similarly, airlines make large investments in air-
craft, and auto manufacturers invest heavily in production plants and equipment. These
types of businesses have relatively low asset turnover ratios. Many other retailers have 
high asset turnover ratios because they don’t need to make large investments in long-lived
operating assets.
129
Chapter 6: Reporting Financial Condition in the Balance Sheet
Q.
Referring to Figure 6-1, determine whether
the size of the business’s balance sheet 
is consistent with the size of its income
statement.
A.
The business has $8,000,000 total assets
(see Figure 6-1), and its annual sales rev-
enue is $12,000,000; therefore, its annual
sales revenue is 1.5 times total assets (this
is its asset turnover ratio). The question
asks whether this ratio is consistent with
the average asset turnover for industry or
not, and in order to answer that, you need
to understand that businesses in most
industries join trade associations. One of
the functions of these trade groups is to
collect information from their members
and publish norms for the industry. So I
look at the trade association information to
judge whether the business is significantly
above or below the norm for the industry.
Generally speaking, an asset turnover ratio
of 1.5 to 1.00 is on the low side. On the
other hand, the business is fairly capital-
intensive (meaning that its fixed assets rep-
resent a relatively large percent of its total
assets). Therefore, its 1.5 to 1.00 asset
turnover ratio may be reasonable.

130
Part II: Preparing Financial Statements 
15. Suppose the average asset turnover ratio
for businesses in the industry is 2.0 to 1.0.
The asset turnover ratio of the business
you’re considering buying is 1.5 to 1.0;
($12,000,000 annual sales revenue ÷
$8,000,000 total assets = 1.5). What may
explain the deviation of the business’s
asset turnover ratio from the average ratio
for the industry?

Clarifying the Values of Assets 
in Balance Sheets
The evidence is pretty strong that readers of financial reports aren’t entirely clear about the
dollar amounts reported for assets in a balance sheet. Other than cash — the value of which
is clear enough — the amounts reported for assets in a balance sheet aren’t at all obvious 
to non-accountants. Balance sheets don’t include reminders or annotations for the valua-
tion basis of each asset. Accountants presume that balance sheet readers understand, or
should understand, the asset values that are reported. Accountants are presumptuous, in
my opinion.
Of course, accountants should be certain about the valuation of every asset reported in the
balance sheet. In preparing a year-end balance sheet, an accountant should do a valuation
check on every asset. Recent authoritative pronouncements on financial accounting stan-
dards have been moving in this direction. For example, accountants now must check at the
end of the accounting year to see whether the value of any asset has been impaired (dimin-
ished in economic value to the business), and if so, the book value of the asset should be
written down.
Except for short-term investments in marketable securities that are held for sale, the
recorded values of assets aren’t written up to recognize appreciation in the replacement or
market values of the assets. For example, the current market value of the land and buildings
owned by a business may be considerably higher than the cost paid for the real estate many
years ago. Or the current replacement value of machinery and equipment owned by a busi-
ness could be more than the depreciated book value of the assets. These assets are used in
the operations of the business and aren’t held for sale. Moreover the assets may not be
replaced for many years. Therefore, appreciation in the market and replacement values of
these assets aren’t recorded. The business makes profit not by holding these assets for sale
but rather by using them in the selling of products and services.

The dollar amounts reported for assets in a balance sheet are the amounts that were recorded
in the original journal entries made when recording the asset transactions. These journal
entries could have been recorded last week, last month, last year, or 20 years ago for some
assets. For example,
 The balance of the asset accounts receivable is from amounts entered in the asset
account when credit sales were recorded. These sales are recent, probably within the
few weeks before the end of the year.
 The balance in the inventory asset account is from the costs of manufacturing or pur-
chasing products. These costs could be from the last two or three months.
 The costs of fixed assets reported in the property, plant, and equipment asset account
in the balance sheet may go back five, ten, or more years — these economic resources
are used a long time.
Accountants have devised different ways to record several expenses. The choice of account-
ing methods affects the balances of several assets, including accounts receivable, inventory,
and accumulated depreciation. (I explain these expense accounting methods in Chapter 9.)
The reported values of these assets depend on which accounting methods a business adopts
to record its expenses. The differences between accounting methods create yet another mad-
dening factor in understanding the dollar amounts reported for assets. No wonder financial
report readers are confused about the values reported for assets in balance sheets!
Although I don’t discuss accounting fraud in this chapter (see Chapter 1), I should point out
that, when reading a financial report, you should be alert for any red flags that indicate some-
thing may not be right in the financial statements. This vigilance is especially important
when you’re considering buying or making a major investment in a business. Not to cast
aspersions on the present shareowners of the business, but they know you’re considering
buying the business, and it’s conceivable that they may have “suggested” that the chief
accountant massage the numbers or even to cook the books to make the financial statements
look as good as possible.
131
Chapter 6: Reporting Financial Condition in the Balance Sheet
Q.
Refer to the company’s most recent bal-
ance sheet in Figure 6-1. The business uses
the straight-line depreciation method, by
which an equal amount of depreciation is
allocated to each year of a fixed asset’s
estimated useful life. If the business had
used accelerated depreciation for its fixed
assets instead, the balance in the accumu-
lated depreciation account would be
$2,100,000. How would its balance sheet be
different if the business had used acceler-
ated depreciation? (Ignore income tax
effects in your answer.)
A.
Accumulated depreciation would be
$700,000 higher, so depreciation expense
over the years would be $700,000 higher.
The higher amounts of deprecation
expenses would reduce cumulative net
income $700,000 (before income tax). Thus,
retained earnings would be $700,000 lower.
The following shows what the balance
sheet of the business would be. Note: In the
following balance sheet, I’ve shaded the
accounts, sub-totals, and totals that differ
from amounts reported in Figure 6-1.

17. Refer to the company’s most recent balance sheet in Figure 6-1. The business uses very conserva-
tive accounting methods for certain expenses, but it could have used more liberal accounting
methods for these expenses. (I explain alternative accounting methods in Chapter 9.) The more
liberal accounting methods would have caused the following results:
• Accounts receivable balance would have been $50,000 higher
• Inventory would have been $225,000 higher
• Accumulated depreciation would have been $300,000 lower
Using the landscape format, prepare a revised balance sheet for the business giving effect to these
differences. (Ignore income tax effects.)

18. Do you see anything suspicious in the balance sheet in Figure 6-1 that may indicate accounting
fraud?
Solve It
Using accelerated depreciation makes the business look considerably smaller, doesn’t it?
With that method, total assets are $7,300,000, compared with $8,000,000 total assets by
using straight-line depreciation (see Figure 6-1).

Using the Balance Sheet in Business Valuation
How much would you pay for a business? Frankly, no accountant could tell you what a busi-
ness is worth because it’s not really an accounting question. Accountants prepare financial
statements; they don’t put a value on the business and report this value in its financial
report. Not in their wildest dreams would accountants think of doing this.
There’s some argument surrounding the question of whether determining the market value
of a going business is rocket science or not. One school of thought is that business valuation
should be based on a complicated, multi-factor, formula-driven model. The opposite camp
argues that in buying a business you’re buying a future stream of earnings but forecasting
future earnings is notoriously difficult and unreliable. Their argument is that you’re just as
well off using a simple method. What does this have to do with a balance sheet? Well, both
sides agree on one thing: The profit performance track record of the business (reported in its
recent income statements) and its present financial condition (reported in its latest balance
sheet) are absolutely critical information for the valuation of a business. The debate con-
cerns how you should analyze and use that information.
The owners’ equity amount of a business is roughly like you telling me how much you paid
for your house some years ago and how much additional money you spent over the years on
home improvements. This cost isn’t very relevant to the current market value of your home.
When have you ever seen a home for sale advertisement that mentions the cost paid by its
present owners? In a similar manner, the “cost” of the owners’ equity reported in a balance
sheet usually isn’t very relevant in putting a value on the business.
Although not a dominant factor in setting the market value of a business, the owners’ equity
reported in the balance sheet isn’t completely irrelevant. Owners’ equity equals the book
(recorded) value of assets less the liabilities of the business, and it’s not often that a busi-
ness sells for less than its owners’ equity amount. Owners’ equity tends to be a floor, or mini-
mum value, for a business.
133
Chapter 6: Reporting Financial Condition in the Balance Sheet
Q.
In reading the company’s latest balance
sheet (Figure 6-1), you see that $3,200,000
is reported for owners’ equity. Is this book
value of owners’ equity a good guide for
putting a value on the business?
A.
In answering this question, the first thing
to mention is that its balance sheet is the
historical financial record of the business,
meaning that it looks backward. In con-
trast, putting a value on a business is 
forward-looking. The $3,200,000 balance in
owners’ equity is a measure of the financial
sacrifice the owners have made to get the
business to its present point. From Figure
6-1, you discover that the shareowners
invested $1,000,000 in the business some
years ago and that the business has
retained $2,200,000 of its profits over the
year instead of paying cash dividends to its
shareowners. This amount of cumulative
profit has been “plowed back” into the
business. The book value (historical-
based) of owners’ equity isn’t a bad point
of departure for putting a current value on
a business. However, business valuation
looks at other factors as well, including the
current replacement values of the busi-
ness’s assets, its future earnings and cash
flow prospects, and so on. Factoring in
these other factors in a business valuation
equation often yields a current market
value that’s considerably higher than the
book value of owners’ equity reported in
the business’s balance sheet.

the $600,000 annual income of the business

value for the business. Suppose you and
the present shareowners agree to this

Instead of the initial financing and investing transactions presented in the preceding example
questions, assume the business issued 100,000 capital stock shares for $1,500,000, borrowed
$2,000,000 on a long-term note payable, and invested $2,800,000 in fixed assets. Using the land-

Following its initial financing and investing transactions in Question 5, the business manufac-
tured its first batch of products. The cost of products manufactured was $650,000, depreciation
was $20,000, and accounts payable increased $185,000. To provide additional cash, the busi-
ness borrowed $250,000 and signed a short-term note payable. Using the landscape (horizon-

A new business has just been organized. A group of investors put $5,000,000 in the business
and the business issued 5,000,000 shares of capital stock to them. The business borrowed
$2,500,000 from a local bank on the basis of a long-term note payable. (Several of the investors
had to guarantee this note, or the bank would not have loaned the money to the business.) 
The business negotiated the purchase of land and buildings that cost $1,250,000. It also paid
$5,250,000 for machinery, production equipment, delivery vehicles, and office equipment and

i
Suppose the business didn’t make credit sales and made only cash sales. Which account(s)
would you not expect to see in its balance sheet?
The business wouldn’t have an accounts receivable asset account because the balance in this
asset account comes from credit sales, which the business didn’t make. Also, the business
wouldn’t have a bad debts expense account. This expense comes from uncollectible accounts
receivable that are written off; however, a business that sells only for cash has other frustrating
expenses, including accepting bad checks from customers, making the wrong change to cus-
tomers, and accepting counterfeit currency.
j
Suppose the business didn’t own any of its fixed assets (long-term operating assets). Instead, it
entered into long-term leases for all these assets (buildings, machinery, equipment, trucks, and
so on). Which account(s) would you not expect to see in its balance sheet?
In this situation, the business wouldn’t have any fixed asset accounts, such as land, buildings,
machinery, equipment, vehicles, computers, office furniture, and so on. Also, the business
wouldn’t have the accumulated depreciation accounts for fixed asset accounts. Instead of
depreciation expense, the business would record rent (or lease) expense.
Accountants should examine long-term leases to see whether a lease, in substance, is an install-
ment purchase of the asset. Depending on the terms of the lease and the purchase options at
the end of the lease, it may be accounted for as a purchase of the asset. If so, the accountant
records the fixed asset and records depreciation over the estimated useful life of the fixed
asset.

Suppose the business was very conservative and didn’t borrow money. Which account(s)
would you not expect to see in its balance sheet?
In this unusual situation, the business wouldn’t have interest-bearing liability accounts such as
notes payable or bonds payable. It wouldn’t have an interest expense account, either. The busi-
ness would have normal operating liability accounts, such as accounts payable and accrued
expenses payable, because these operating liabilities don’t bear interest.
l
Suppose the business sold only services and not products. Which account(s) would you not
expect to see in its balance sheet?
The business wouldn’t have an inventory asset account or a cost of goods sold expense account.
Also, its accounts payable liability balance would be relatively low compared with a business
that sells products. For a company that sells products, a good part of its accounts payable lia-
bility balance consists of products purchased on credit (or raw materials used in the manufac-
turing process that are purchased on credit). In contrast, a business that sells only services
doesn’t buy products or raw materials on credit.
m
Suppose that just before the end of the year, the business paid an additional $400,000 of its
accounts payable. Normally, it would not have accelerated payments of accounts payable, but
the order to do so came down from “on high,” and the payments were made. Why do you think
the business may have done this?
In order to answer this question, you need to look at the business’s year-end balance sheet:
Pay attention to the current ratio: $4,200,000 current assets ÷ $2,400,000 current liabilities =
1.75 current ratio. By making pay downs on accounts payable very late in the year (perhaps on
the very last day of the year), the business improved its current ratio to 1.75 from the 1.64 cur-
rent ratio in the original scenario (see Figure 6-1). In many cases, a business is under pressure
to keep its current ratio as high as possible. What the business in this question did isn’t illegal,
but the payment should arouse some uneasiness in the accountant. The accountant should
make a judgment on the materiality of this action that improves the current ratio from 1.64 to
1.75. Is this a material difference, that is, is it one that could mislead the balance sheet readers?
This is a tough question to answer.
The effect on the current ratio isn’t material, so nothing would be said about it in the financial
statements of the business. If the effect is judged to be material, then the accountant should
consider calling it to the attention of the audit committee of the business or another high-level
financial officer in the business. The business’s financial statements may be audited by an inde-
pendent CPA firm. The auditors should catch this manipulation of the current ratio, and if they
judge it to be material, the CPA firm should bring it to the attention of the audit committee or
the board of directors.

Suppose the business held its books open for several days into the next year. It recorded an addi-
tional $200,000 of payments from customers as if they had been received on December 31 (the
last day of its fiscal year) even though the money wasn’t actually received and deposited in its
bank account until after the end of the year. Why do think the business may have done this?
This maneuver is called window dressing; it’s done to improve the cash balance reported in the
balance sheet and to improve the quick ratio. In order to answer this question, you need to
look at the business’s year-end balance sheet:
In the original scenario, the quick ratio is .54 to 1.00, which is lower than the manipulated ratio
($1,700,000 cash ÷ $2,800,000 current liabilities = .61 to 1.00 quick ratio). When I was in public
accounting years ago, many of our audit clients employed window dressing. I must admit that
we (the CPA auditors) tolerated holding the books open for a few days in order to allow the
business to report a higher cash balance and a better quick ratio. Current assets and current
liabilities don’t change, so holding the books open doesn’t change the current ratio.
o
Suppose the average asset turnover ratio for businesses in the industry is 2.0 to 1.0. The asset
turnover ratio of the business you’re considering buying is 1.5 to 1.0; ($12,000,000 annual sales
revenue ÷ $8,000,000 total assets = 1.5). What may explain the deviation of the business’s asset
turnover ratio from the average ratio for the industry?
The business’s total assets are too high relative to its annual sales revenue; looking at it another
way, its annual sales revenue is too low relative to its total assets. One reason may be that the
business has excess capacity, meaning that it may be over-invested in its fixed assets. For exam-
ple, its building may be too large or it may have more trucks than it needs to make deliveries.
Excess capacity is a good place to start, but fixed assets may not be the main reason for a
below-normal asset turnover ratio. You should examine all assets to see whether their balances
are too big.
The business may have allowed the size of its inventory to get out of control. Perhaps its
accounts receivable balance is too high because of lax collection efforts, or it’s possible that
the business has too much cash relative to its day-to-day operating needs. It could be that the
business had a sudden and unexpected dip in sales towards the end of the year. Perhaps it
hasn’t had time to downsize its assets and adjust to the lower sales level. The business may
think that the drop in sales is only temporary and, therefore, it wants to keep its assets at their
present levels to support the predicted bounce back in sales next year.
p
Does the balance sheet presented in Figure 6-1 give any indication of how old the company is,
or how many years it has been in business? Are there any particular accounts or other items in
the balance sheet that indicate whether the company is fairly new or has been around for many
years?
One clue regarding the age of the business is the balance in its accumulated depreciation
account as a percent of the cost of the fixed assets being depreciated. The higher the percent-
age, the older the business is likely to be. But this is really just guesswork. Financial statements
don’t report the age of a business. However, financial reports may include a historical summary
of key data (such as annual sales, annual net income, total assets, and so on), which often go
back to the first year of business.

q
Refer to the company’s most recent balance sheet in Figure 6-1. The business uses very conser-
vative accounting methods for certain expenses, but it could have used more liberal accounting
methods for these expenses. (I explain alternative accounting methods in Chapter 9.) The more
liberal accounting methods would have caused the following results:
• Accounts receivable balance would have been $50,000 higher
• Inventory would have been $225,000 higher
• Accumulated depreciation would have been $300,000 lower
Using the landscape format, prepare a revised balance sheet for the business giving effect to
these differences. (Ignore income tax effects.)
The year-end balance sheet of the business would have been as follows:
The expenses of the business over the years would have been $575,000 lower; ($50,000 lower
bad debts expense + $225,000 lower cost of goods sold expense + $300,000 lower depreciation
expense = $575,000 lower expenses in total). Therefore, cumulative net income would have
been $575,000 higher (before income tax), and the balance of retained earnings would have
been $575,000 higher. (Adding the $575,000 increase in cumulative net income to the $2,200,000
retained earnings balance in Figure 6-1 equals the $2,775,000 retained earnings balance shown
in this answer.)
r
Do you see anything suspicious in the balance sheet in Figure 6-1 that may indicate accounting
fraud?
I don’t see anything suspicious in the balance sheet that may indicate that some accounting
hanky-panky is going on, but you never know. A good con artist will try to make everything look
right. So, who knows for sure? The first rule of an auditor is to be skeptical. I’m an old “old audi-
tor” at heart, and I’ve seen too many fraudulent financial statements in my time. As they say in
politics, “Trust, but verify.” The problem is that financial report users may not be able to verify
the information presented in financial statements. Furthermore, CPA auditors don’t necessarily
catch accounting fraud in financial statements. Unfortunately, the risk of accounting fraud is
always present.
s
One simple business valuation approach doesn’t look at the balance sheet, at least not in put-
ting a numerical value on the business. (The potential buyer of a business would scour the bal-
ance sheet to see whether there may be solvency problems.) This business valuation approach
is called the earnings multiple method. For example, the $600,000 annual profit of the business
could be multiplied by 8 to get $4,800,000 value for the business. Suppose you and the present
shareowners agree to this price, and you buy all the capital stock shares for this price. What
happens to the difference between the $4,800,000 price you paid and the $3,200,000 owners’
equity reported in the balance sheet?
This question goes back to a point I mention in Chapter 1: The starting point in accounting is 
to identify the entity being accounted for. The business is one entity and your investment in 
the business is another entity. They’re two distinct entities. Accounting for the financial activi-
ties of a business does not involve keeping track of the investment activities of its individual
shareowners.

One shareowner may sell his or her capital stock shares to another person, but this exchange
of shares isn’t a transaction of the business. The business didn’t receive the $4,800,000 you
paid for the shares you bought; the individuals that sold their shares to you received the
$4,800,000. The same number of capital stock shares remains in the hands of shareowners, and
the business makes no accounting entry for the exchange of stock shares among its shareown-
ers. In the accounting for your individual investment, you should record the $4,800,000 cost of
your investment, but this is your private affair and as such isn’t recorded by the business.
t
Suppose you agree to pay $4,800,000 for all the capital stock shares of the business. At the
eleventh hour, the owners ask you to make one concession: They want to take out $500,000
from the business as a cash dividend but are still asking $4,800,000 for their shares. Would this
make a difference in the price you’re willing to pay for the business?
The market valuation of a business usually doesn’t consist of adding up the market values of
every asset and deducting the liabilities of the business. In most cases, the forecast of its future
earnings is the dominant factor in setting a value on a business. The fact that the business
would have $500,000 less cash may not affect its future earnings performance; the business
would still have $1,000,000 cash to operate with, and this balance may be adequate. Yet, this
last-minute tactic by the present owners isn’t good because it takes $500,000 out of the busi-
ness, which means that you (the new owner) have $500,000 less cash to work with for growth
and expansion of the business.

E
very time an accountant records a sale or expense entry using double-entry account-
ing, he or she sees the interconnections between the income statement and balance
sheet. (I explain the rules for debits and credits in Chapter 3.) A sale increases an asset or
decreases a liability, and an expense decreases an asset or increases a liability. Therefore,
one side of every sales and expense entry is in the income statement, and the other side is
in the balance sheet. You can’t record a sale or an expense without affecting the balance
sheet. The income statement and balance sheet are inseparable, but they aren’t reported
this way!
To properly interpret financial statements — the income statement, the balance sheet, and
the statement of cash flows — you need to understand the links between the three state-
ments, but, unfortunately, the links aren’t easy to see. Each financial statement appears on 
a separate page in the annual financial report, and the threads of connection between the
financial statements aren’t referred to. In reading financial reports, non-accountants — and
even accountants — usually don’t spot these connections.
I explain the income statement in Chapter 5 and the balance sheet in Chapter 6. In this 
chapter, I stitch these two financial statements together and mark the trails of connections
between sales revenue and expenses (in the income statement) and their corresponding
assets and liabilities (in the balance sheet). In Chapter 8, I explain the connections between
the amounts reported in the statement of cash flows and the other two financial statements.
Rejoining the Income Statement 
and Balance Sheet
Figure 7-1 shows the lines of connection between income statement accounts and balance
sheet accounts. When reading financial statements, in your mind’s eye, you should “see”
these lines of connection. Because financial reports don’t offer a clue about these connec-
tions, it may help to actually draw the lines of connection, like you would if you were high-
lighting lines in a textbook.

Here’s a quick summary explaining the lines of connection in Figure 7-1, starting from
the top and working down to the bottom:
 Making sales (and incurring expenses for making sales) requires a business to
maintain a working cash balance.
 Making sales on credit generates accounts receivable.
 Selling products requires the business to carry an inventory (stock) of products.
 Acquiring products involves purchases on credit that generate accounts
payable.
 Depreciation expense is recorded for the use of fixed assets (long-term operating
resources).
 Depreciation is recorded in the accumulated depreciation contra account
(instead decreasing the fixed asset account).
 Amortization expense is recorded for limited-life intangible assets.
 Operating expenses is a broad category of costs encompassing selling, adminis-
trative, and general expenses:
• Some of these operating costs are prepaid before the expense is recorded,
and until the expense is recorded, the cost stays in the prepaid expenses
asset account.
• Some of these operating costs involve purchases on credit that generate
accounts payable.
• Some of these operating costs are from recording unpaid expenses in the
accrued expenses payable liability.
 Borrowing money on notes payable causes interest expense.
 A portion (usually relatively small) of income tax expense for the year is unpaid
at year-end, which is recorded in the accrued expenses payable liability.
 Earning net income increases retained earnings.

Q.
For the year just ended, a business reports
$5,200,000 sales revenue. All its sales are
made on credit (to other businesses).
Historically, its year-end accounts receiv-
able balance equals about five weeks of
annual sales revenue; in other words, an
amount equal to five weeks of annual sales
revenue is not yet collected at the end of
the year. Sales are level throughout the
year. What amount of accounts receivable
would you expect in the business’s year-
end balance sheet?
A.
Dividing $5,200,000 annual sales revenue
by 52 weeks gives $100,000 average sales
per week. Based on its past experience, the
ending balance of accounts receivables
should be about $500,000, which equals
five weeks of annual sales revenue.

Filling in Key Pieces of the Balance Sheet 
from the Income Statement
Laying the foundation for the balance sheet of a business using its normative operating ratios
is very instructive. An operating ratio expresses the size of an asset or liability on the basis
of sales revenue or an expense in the annual income statement. A normative operating ratio
refers to how large an asset or liability should be relative to sales revenue or its related
expense in the annual income statement.
Suppose a business, Company X, makes all its sales on credit and offers its customers one
month to pay. Very few customers pay early, and some customers are chronic late-payers. To
encourage repeat sales, the business tolerates these late-payers, and as a result, its accounts
receivable equals five weeks of annual sales revenue. Thus, its normative operating ratio of
accounts receivable to annual sales revenue is 5 to 52.
The actual ratio of the year-end accounts receivable balance to annual sales revenue is
unlikely to be precisely 5 to 52, which equals 9.615 percent of sales revenue. The 5 to 52 oper-
ating ratio is the normative ratio between accounts receivable and annual sales revenue; it’s
based on the sales credit policies of the business and how aggressive the business is in col-
lecting receivables when customers don’t pay on time. The 5 to 52 ratio is a benchmark, in
other words. Minor deviations are harmless, but significant variances deserve serious man-
agement attention and follow-up.
In Chapter 6, I build the balance sheet based on actual transactions of the business, starting
with its initial financing and investing activities and moving to the manufacturing of its first
batch of products. Of course, actual balance sheets are the result of recording actual transac-
tions. In this section, in contrast, I start with the normative operating ratios for a business.

Based on these critical metrics for the business, I determine the balances for certain of
its assets and liabilities. These amounts are what the balances would be if the results
of the business’s transactions came in right on the money so that every operating ratio
ended up being exactly what it should be.
The annual income statement of Company X is presented in Figure 7-2. From the sales
revenue and expenses reported in the income statement, I determine the balances of
several assets and liabilities using the normative operating ratios for the business.
Operating ratios can be expressed in terms of weeks of the 52 weeks year (or they can
be expressed as percentages of annual sales revenue or annual expense). I use weeks
of the year in this example. The normative operating ratios for the business whose
income statement is presented in Figure 7-2 are as follows:
 Cash equals seven weeks of annual sales revenue.
 Accounts receivable equals five weeks of annual sales revenue.
 Inventory equals 13 weeks of annual cost of goods sold.
 The prepaid expenses asset balance equals four weeks of annual selling and gen-
eral expenses.
 Accounts payable for inventory acquisitions equals four weeks of annual cost of
goods sold.
 Accounts payable for supplies and services bought on credit equals four weeks
of annual selling and general expenses.
 Accrued expenses payable for operating expenses equals six weeks of annual
selling and general expenses.
The business doesn’t own intangible assets and therefore doesn’t have amortization
expense. I don’t include accrued interest payable and income tax payable in the exam-
ple for two reasons: First, these year-end liabilities typically are relatively small
amounts compared with the major assets and liabilities of a business. Second, the
expenses that drive these liabilities aren’t operating expenses. The year-end balance of
accrued interest payable depends on the terms for paying interest on the business’s
debt. Income tax expense, as you know, depends on the income tax status of the busi-
ness and its policies regarding making installment payments toward its annual income
tax during the year. In short, it’s not possible to apply operating ratios for these two
liabilities.

Chapter 7: Coupling the Income Statement and Balance Sheet

The ratio of annual depreciation expense to the original cost of fixed assets can’t be normal-
ized. Different fixed assets are depreciated over different estimated useful life spans. Some
fixed assets are depreciated according to the straight-line method and others according to an
accelerated depreciation method. (I explain these depreciation methods in Chapter 9.) The
annual depreciation expense should be a reasonable fraction of original cost. It would be
unusual, and even suspicious, in fact, if depreciation expense were more than 15 percent or
so of the total original cost of fixed assets.

These asset and liability balances are normative, not the actual balances that would be
reported in the business’s balance sheet. The balances provide a useful benchmark against
which the actual balances can be compared. Unusual deviations indicate that something
has gotten out of control or that the business has made a fundamental shift in its operating
polices and needs to revise its operating ratio yardsticks.
In Figure 7-3, you can see a partial balance sheet that presents only the assets and liabilities
determined in the preceding example question. Later in the chapter, I fill in the remainder of
the balance sheet, including fixed assets, interest-bearing debt, and owners’ equity.

Putting Fixed Assets in the Picture
One asset is obviously missing in the partial balance sheet shown in Figure 7-3: the
fixed assets of the business. Virtually every business needs these long-lived economic
resources to carry on its profit-making activities.
The cost and accumulated depreciation of a business’s fixed assets depends on when
the assets were bought (recently or many years ago?), the sort of long-term operating
assets the business needs, and whether the business leases or owns these assets. I
can’t offer you a ratio for the original cost of fixed assets and annual sales revenue
because it’s very difficult to generalize about the cost of fixed assets relative to annual
sales revenue. If I had to hazard a ballpark estimate for this ratio, I would say that
annual sales revenue of a business is generally between two to four times the total
cost of its fixed assets. But please take this estimation with a grain of salt. The ratio
varies widely from industry to industry, and even within the same industry, the ratio
can vary from company to company. Generally speaking, retailers have a higher ratio
of sales to fixed assets than heavy equipment manufacturers and transportation com-
panies (airlines, truckers, and so on).
In Figure 7-4, you can see my educated guess for the fixed assets’ cost and the accumu-
lated depreciation on the fixed assets. The partial balance sheet shown in Figure 7-4
tells an interesting story: Company X has $3,855,000 total assets, but where did it get
that $3,855,000? Its two operating liabilities provided $515,000 of the total assets;
($350,000 accounts payable + $165,000 accrued expenses payable = $515,000). So
where did the remaining $3,340,000 come from?

11. Instead of the amounts shown in Figure 7-4,
suppose that the cost of Company X’s fixed

12. Assume that the balances of assets,

payable were the same as shown in Fig-
ure 7-4. However, the balance of accumu-

raise more capital?
Solve It
Completing the Balance Sheet 
with Debt and Equity
If you owned Company X, whose balance sheet is depicted in Figure 7-4, how should you
have raised the $3,340,000 capital? You can debate this question until the cows come 
home because there’s no right or best answer. The two basic sources of business capital are
interest-bearing debt and equity (more precisely, owners’ equity). Where to secure capital is
really a business financial management question, not an accounting question per se. As a
practical matter, many businesses borrow as much as they can and use owners’ equity for
the rest of the capital they need.
Most businesses use debt for part of their capital needs, and this practice makes sense as
long as the business doesn’t overextend its debt obligations. Because this isn’t a book on
business finance, a debate concerning debt versus equity isn’t in order. Instead, I move on to
the complete balance sheet of the business.
Figure 7-5 presents the complete balance sheet for Company X, including its debt and owners’
equity accounts. These are the final pieces of the balance sheet puzzle (if you started at the
beginning of this chapter, this is what you’ve been working toward). The business has bor-
rowed $500,000 on short-term notes payable (due in one year or less) and $1,000,000 on long-
term notes payable. Balance sheets may or may not report the annual interest rates on their
notes (and bonds) payable. If not reported in the balance sheet proper, interest rates and
other relevant details of debt contracts are disclosed in the footnotes to the financial state-
ments. For example, debt covenants (conditions prescribed by the debt contract) may limit
the amount of cash dividends the business can pay to its shareowners.

The shareowners in Company X invested $750,000, for which they received 10,000 cap-
ital stock shares. Even relatively simple-looking business corporation ownership struc-
tures can be more complex than they appear. Typically, a footnote is necessary to fully
explain the ownership structure of a business corporation. (If you don’t believe me,
read the shareowners’ equity footnotes of any business.) As a general rule, private
business corporations don’t have to disclose who owns how many of their capital
stock shares in their financial statements. In contrast, public business corporations are
subject to many disclosure rules regarding the stock ownership, stock options, and
other stock-based compensation benefits of their officers and top-level managers.
Over the years, the business in this scenario retained $1,090,000 of its yearly profits
(see retained earnings in Figure 7-5). You can’t tell from the balance sheet how much of
this cumulative total is from any one year. Nor can you tell from the income statement
or the balance sheet how much of its $255,125 profit for the year (see Figure 7-2) was
distributed as a cash dividend to shareowners during the year just ended. One pur-
pose of the statement of cash flows (which I explain in Chapter 8) is to report the cash
dividends paid from net income to shareowners during the year.
Questions 13 through 16 are based on the following income statement and balance
sheet of a new business example that I call Company Z. You’re asked to determine cer-
tain operating ratios for the business based on the information in its income statement

Answers to Problems on Coupling the Income
Statement and Balance Sheet
The following are the answers to the practice questions presented earlier in this chapter.
a
The business in the example question has an annual cost of goods sold expense of $3,120,000.
Historically, its ending inventory balance equals about 13 weeks of annual sales. What amount
of inventory would you expect in its year-end balance sheet?
$3,120,000 ÷ 52 weeks = $60,000 average cost of goods sold per week × 13 weeks operating ratio 
= $780,000 inventory balance in its year-end balance sheet
b
The business in the example question has an annual cost of goods sold expense of $3,120,000.
Historically, the business’s accounts payable for inventory purchases equals about four weeks
of annual cost of goods sold. What amount of accounts payable for inventory purchases would
you expect in its year-end balance sheet? (Note: The accounts payable balance also includes an
amount from purchases of supplies and services on credit; this question concerns only the
amount of accounts payable from inventory purchases.)
$3,120,000 ÷ 52 weeks = $60,000 average cost of goods sold per week × 4 weeks operating ratio =
$240,000 accounts payable for inventory purchases balance in its year-end balance sheet
c
The business in the example question has an annual operating expenses amount of $1,378,000
(which excludes depreciation, amortization, interest, and income tax expenses). Historically, its
year-end balance of accrued expenses payable equals about six weeks of its annual operating
expenses. Ignoring accrued interest payable and income tax payable, what amount of accrued
expenses payable would you expect in its year-end balance sheet?
$1,378,000 ÷ 52 weeks = $26,500 average operating expenses per week × 6 weeks operating ratio
= $159,000 accrued expenses payable balance in its year-end balance sheet
d
For the business in the example question, the average amount borrowed on notes payable during
the year was $1,500,000. The average annual interest rate on these notes was 6.5 percent. What
amount of interest expense would you find in the business’s income statement for the year?
$1,500,000 average notes payable × 6.5 percent interest rate = $97,500 annual interest expense
e
Determine the balance of cash based on the normative operating ratio for this asset account.
(Refer to the list of normative operating ratios for Company Y.)
$15,400,000 annual sales revenue × 15 percent operating ratio = $2,310,000 cash balance
f
Determine the balance of accounts receivable based on the normative operating ratio for this
asset account. (Refer to the list of normative operating ratios for Company Y.)
$15,400,000 annual sales revenue × 12 percent operating ratio = $1,848,000 accounts receivable
balance
g
Determine the balance of inventory based on the normative operating ratio for this asset
account. (Refer to the list of normative operating ratios for Company Y.)
$8,470,000 annual cost of goods sold × 20 percent operating ratio = $1,694,000 inventory 
balance
h
Determine the balance of prepaid expenses based on the normative operating ratio for this
asset account. (Refer to the list of normative operating ratios for Company Y.)
$4,368,000 annual selling and general expenses × 8 percent operating ratio = $349,440 prepaid
expenses balance

i
Determine the balance of accounts payable based on the normative operating ratios for this lia-
bility account. (Refer to the list of normative operating ratios for Company Y.)
$8,470,000 annual cost of goods sold × 8 percent operating ratio = $677,600 accounts payable
for inventory purchases
$4,368,000 annual selling and general expenses × 8 percent operating ratio = $349,440 accounts
payable for selling and general expenses
$677,600 + $349,440 = $1,027,040 accounts payable balance
j
Determine the balance of accrued expenses payable based on the normative operating ratio for
this liability account. (Refer to the list of normative operating ratios for Company Y.)
$4,368,000 annual selling and general expenses × 15 percent operating ratio = $655,200 accrued
expenses payable balance
k
Instead of the amounts shown in Figure 7-4, suppose that the cost of Company X’s fixed assets
was $3,850,000 and that accumulated depreciation was $958,000. Determine the amount of capi-
tal the business would have had to raise in this scenario.
Based on the higher amount invested in fixed assets, and taking into account the larger amount
of accumulated depreciation, Company X would have had to raise $4,467,000 total capital (see
the following balance sheet for the business). This is $1,127,000 more compared to the example
in Figure 7-4 ($4,467,000 capital raised in this scenario – $3,340,000 capital raised in Figure 7-4 =
$1,127,000 additional capital).
l
Assume that the balances of assets, accounts payable, and accrued expenses payable were the
same as shown in Figure 7-4. However, the balance of accumulated depreciation was $400,000.
In this scenario, would Company X have had to raise more capital?
Based on the smaller balance of accumulated depreciation, Company X would have had to raise
$3,625,000 total capital (see the following balance sheet for the business). This is $285,000 more
compared with the example in Figure 7-4 ($3,625,000 capital raised in this scenario – $3,340,000
capital raised in Figure 7-4 = $285,000 additional capital).

Company X recorded $285,000 less depreciation in this scenario than in Figure 7-4 ($685,000
accumulated depreciation in Figure 7-4 – $400,000 accumulated depreciation in this scenario =
$285,000 less accumulated depreciation). Therefore, the retained earnings balance of the busi-
ness is $285,000 higher (before income tax). Retained earnings is part of owners’ equity, so the
owners’ equity source of capital is $285,000 higher in this scenario than in the scenario
depicted in Figure 7-4.

Reporting Cash Flows and Changes

In This Chapter
 Revisiting the determination of profit
 Addressing changes in owners’ equity
 Looking at profit from the cash flow point of view
 Preparing the cash flows report
T
he financial report of a business consists of three primary financial statements: the
income statement for the period, the balance sheet at the end of the period, and the state-
ment of cash flows for the period. This chapter examines the statement of cash flows, which
is the most recent financial statement to be required in business financial reports.
The history of the statement of cash flows is complex; despite repeated calls from the invest-
ment community for cash-flow information in financial reports — and after a rather inept
experiment with reporting a funds flow statement — in 1987, the accounting profession
finally required that a statement of cash flows be included in financial reports. The cash-flow
statement has been included in financial reports for about two decades now, and it’s likely to
remain a permanent fixture in business financial reporting.
In my opinion, the statement of cash flows is the most difficult of the three financial state-
ments to understand and interpret. This statement reports a company’s sources and uses of
cash, and that seems pretty straightforward. However, many cash-flow statements present
tangled cash-flow threads that are very difficult to follow. Accountants are partly to blame for
this mess, in my opinion; if I were a paranoid investor, I may think that businesses deliber-
ately make their statements of cash flows difficult to read.
This chapter carries a disclaimer: The following discussion doesn’t adhere to the party line.
It’s not the standard textbook approach to understanding cash flows. I think it’s better. Of
course, I might be a wee bit biased.
Figuring Profit from the Balance Sheet
Suppose you’re the accountant for a business that suffers a terrible fire that destroys virtu-
ally everything, including its accounting records. (In hindsight, the business should have had
stored back-up accounting records off-premises, but it didn’t.) When escaping the burning
building, the bookkeeper managed to grab one piece of smoldering paper. The bottom part 
of the page had already burned away, but the bookkeeper thought that this scrap of paper
might be helpful, and he was right. The paper contains the business’s balance sheets at the
end of its two most recent years, minus the last few lines that burned away.

Figure 8-1 presents the balance sheets of the business at the end of its two most recent years.
The changes between the year-end balances are included, and the balance sheet is presented
in the portrait, or vertical format, which accountants sometimes refer to as the report form.
(The term “report form” is not a very descriptive term, in my opinion).
Unfortunately, the 2007 income statement was lost in the fire. The president wants to know
the net income for the year and asks whether you can determine profit from the information
in Figure 8-1. Yes, you can determine profit by comparing the net worth of the business at
year-end 2007 against its net worth at the end of 2006.

Part II: Preparing Financial Statements 

The net worth of a business equals its total assets minus its total liabilities. Earning net
income increases the net worth of the business. The net worth of the business in this exam-
ple increases $205,000 from year-end 2006 to year-end 2007, so the net income of the busi-
ness for 2007 is $205,000. Well, maybe net income is $201,000 or maybe not; read on.
The net income amount for this business depends on two other factors, and you need to
answer the following questions before you can reach a final answer regarding net income:
 Did the shareowners invest additional capital in the business? An infusion of new
ownership capital in the business increases the net worth of the business. Any amount
of net worth increase from owners putting additional capital into the business is
deducted from the change in net worth in determining net income for the year.
 Did the business distribute cash dividends to its shareowners during the year? Cash
dividends from profit decrease the net worth of the business. Therefore, the amount 
of cash dividends is added to the change in net worth in determining net income for
the year.
161
Chapter 8: Reporting Cash Flows and Changes in Owners’ Equity
Q.
The president of the business also serves
as the chair of its board of directors. After
you have determined net income for 2007
based on the balance sheet in Figure 8-1,
the president tells you that he thinks
$200,000 cash dividends were paid to
shareowners during 2007. Based on this
additional information about cash divi-
dends, what amount of net income did the
business earn in 2007?
A.
The net worth of the business increased
$205,000 during the year, as explained ear-
lier in this section. The $200,000 amount of
cash dividends to stockholders decreased
net worth because $200,000 of owners’
equity is taken out of the business. The
$200,000 amount of cash dividends is
added to the $205,000 net worth increase
to get $405,000 net income for the year. In
other words, even after the $200,000 cash
dividends, net worth still increased
$205,000. Net income had to increase net
worth $405,000 for this to happen.
1.
After you revise your net income answer (see the example question in this section), the president
tells you that he has since talked with other directors of the business and realized that he was
wrong about the cash dividends. Now he’s fairly certain that $250,000 cash dividends were paid to
shareowners during 2007 and that the business issued additional capital stock shares for $50,000.
Based on this additional information, what amount of net income did the business earn in 2007?

Reporting the Statement of Changes 
in Stockholders’ Equity
From information about the company’s annual profit performance, dividends, and capital
invested by or returned to shareowners, the accountant prepares a statement of changes in
stockholders’ equity. This statement is included in the annual financial report of the business.
It is called a “statement,” but it’s really more of a schedule of changes in the owners’ equity
accounts. Because the primary audience of the financial report is the business’s shareowners
(the stockholders of a business corporation), they’re very interested in the changes in their
accounts.
Figure 8-2 presents the basic structure of a statement of changes in stockholders’ equity for
the business example introduced in Figure 8-1. Note that the statement covers two years.
The statement of changes in stockholders’ equity illustrated in Figure 8-2 is actually a fairly
simple example. A business may have a complicated capital structure, in which case this
schedule includes much more detail than shown in Figure 8-2; the number of shares for each
class of stock issued by the business would be reported, but that number isn’t important for
the task at hand in this section, so I don’t bother to include this data in Figure 8-2.

Chapter 8: Reporting Cash Flows and Changes in Owners’ Equity

Please refer to Figure 8-1 that presents the
comparative balance sheet of the business
and to Figure 8-2 that presents its state-
ment of changes in stockholders’ equity.
Suppose the business had paid $175,000
cash dividends (instead of $250,000) to
stockholders in 2007. In this scenario,
which dollar amounts in the business’s
comparative balance sheet would be differ-
ent as the result of this one change?
Solve It
5.
Suppose the business in the example (see
Figure 8-2) did not issue additional shares
of capital stock in 2007 and did not distrib-
ute dividends to its stockholders in either
2006 or 2007. In this scenario, is the state-
ment of changes in stockholders’ equity
needed? Should it be presented in the com-
pany’s 2007 annual financial report?
Solve It
In Figure 8-2, total owners’ equity equals $1,840,000 at the end of 2006 ($750,000 capital 
stock + $1,090,000 retained earnings = $1,840,000). And at the end of 2007, total owners’
equity equals $2,045,000 ($800,000 capital stock + $1,245,000 retained earnings = $2,045,000).
These two owners’ equity amounts are the same as the net worth amounts used in determin-
ing profit by the comparative net worth method (see the preceding section). In short, net
worth equals owners’ equity and net income increases owners’ equity.

Determining Cash Effect from Making Profit
Someone has to be in charge of managing the cash flows and cash balance of a business. 
In mid-size and large businesses, the person with this heavy responsibility is probably the
treasurer, vice president of finance, or chief financial officer. In smaller businesses, the presi-
dent may manage cash flows in addition to all his or her other functions. Simply put, if cash
isn’t managed carefully, the business could run out of cash, and that would be a disaster.
(One major consequence is that employees wouldn’t be paid on time.) Managing cash flow is
a top priority of every business, and this management starts with cash flow from profit.
Borrowing money and gaining owner investments in the business increase its cash balance.
But cash flow from profit doesn’t refer to these two sources of cash. The term refers to the net
cash result from the sales and expenses of the business during the period. Sales and expenses
are also called operating activities or profit-making activities. In the statement of cash flows
the increase or decrease of cash during the period from the business’s profit-making activi-
ties is called cash flow from operating activities. This is a rather technical term that is not all
that clear in my opinion. For brevity and clarity I prefer the term cash flow from profit, which I
use throughout this chapter – except where I have to use the formal term cash flow from
operating activities in the statement of cash flows.
164
Part II: Preparing Financial Statements 
Q.
Continuing the example scenario created earlier in this chapter, the president asks you to deter-
mine cash flow from profit (net income) in 2007. In other words, he wants to know how much the
business’s cash balance increased from making profit in the year. Based on the information in its
comparative balance sheet (Figure 8-1) and its statement of changes in stockholders equity
(Figure 8-2), determine the business’s cash flow from profit for 2007. Did its cash balance increase
$405,000, the same amount as net income? Or, did cash increase a different amount? Did cash
decrease as the result of the company’s profit-making activities? (It’s possible.)
A.
During the year, the business increased its cash $250,000 from borrowing (see the increases in
short-term and long-term notes payable in Figure 8-1). The business issued additional capital
stock shares for $50,000 and paid $250,000 cash dividends to shareowners during the year (see
Figure 8-2). Therefore, the net cash increase from its financing activities was $50,000: ($250,000
increase in debt + $50,000 issue of stock shares - $250,000 dividends = $50,000 cash increase). The
business spent $425,000 cash for additions and replacements to its property, plant, and equip-
ment (see the increase in this fixed asset account in Figure 8-1). These cash outlays are classified
as investing activities. Last, note that the company’s cash balance increased $201,000 during the
year (see Figure 8-1).
This question asks you to determine the business’s cash flow from operating activities (cash flow
from profit) for the year. It does not ask you to prepare the formal statement of cash flows for the
year (which I explain in the next section). Since the objective is to get cash flow from profit, I
favor the method explained in Chapter 1. The four components of cash flow from profit are assem-
bled in the following summary for the business example:
Summary of Cash Flows For the Year
Cash flow from operating activities
????
Cash flow from investing activities
($425,000)
Cash flow from financing activities
 $50,000
Increase in cash during the year
$201,000
Solving for the unknown factor, cash flow from profit is $576,000 for the year. The $576,000 cash
flow from profit plus the $50,000 net cash increase from financing activities provided the business
$626,000 cash. It used $425,000 for capital expenditures. So its cash balance increased $201,000.

This analysis method (solving for the unknown factor) is a “backdoor” approach for deter-
mining cash flow from profit. First, you determine the net change in cash caused by the
investing and financing activities. Then you compare this amount to the change in cash
during the year. The rest of the change in cash during the year must equal the cash flow
from profit. This method is an expedient and practical way to answer the question.
If all you need to know is the final amount of cash flow from profit for the period, the analysis
method just demonstrated gives you the correct answer. But I should remind you that the
statement of cash flows provides information about several determinants of cash flow from
operating activities, as well as the final amount. These determinants of cash flow from profit
are explained in the next section.

Part II: Preparing Financial Statements 
Presenting the Statement of Cash Flows
A business’s accountant prepares the income statement from its sales revenue and expense
accounts and prepares the balance sheet from its asset, liability, and owners’ equity
accounts. However, there are no cash flow accounts from which to prepare the statement of
cash flows. 
How does an accountant prepare the statement of cash flows without ready-made accounts
with cash flow balances? This is an interesting question, well, interesting to accountants I
should say. I doubt that non-accountants care a fig about how the accountants do their work
in preparing financial statements. Accountants use different techniques for gathering and
analyzing the information needed to prepare the statement of cash flows.
Theoretically, an accountant could analyze and classify all the entries in the cash account
during the year to collect the information needed to prepare the statement of cash flows.
However, going back and looking at the large number of entries in the cash account during
the year isn’t a very practical method for pulling together the information needed to prepare
the statement of cash flows.

Today, businesses use computers in their accounting systems, as you know. It’s conceivable
that a company could design its data entry procedures and computer programs such that at
the end of the year the computer would spit out exactly the information needed to prepare
the statement of cash flows. Evidently this is not done by many businesses. In most busi-
nesses this financial statement is assembled the old fashion way — the accountant sits 
down and organizes the information pretty much by hand. The information can be put into 
a spreadsheet program to do the tedious computations and groupings.
Reporting Cash Flows
Regardless of how the accountant goes about organizing the information needed to prepare
it, the statement of cash flows is fundamentally the same for every business. Figure 8-4 pres-
ents the business’s statement of cash flows for 2007. The format of this financial statement is
in accordance with the official standard governing reporting cash flows. Figure 8-4 presents
cash flows for only one year, but most public companies present a two- or three-year com-
parative statement of cash flows. Their financial reporting practices are heavily influenced
by the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). (Financial reports of
private businesses aren’t in the public domain, so it’s hard to generalize about their report-
ing practices in this respect.)

Chapter 8: Reporting Cash Flows and Changes in Owners’ Equity

In the statement of cash flows, transactions are grouped into three types (see Figure 8-4):
 Operating activities: The section reports the determinants of the cash increase or
decrease attributable to the profit-making operations of the business during the
period, and the final amount of cash flow from operating activities for the period — 
a positive $576,000 in the example.
 Investing activities: This section includes expenditures for long-term operating assets
and proceeds from the disposal of these assets (if any), and the net cash increase or
decrease from these activities for the period — a negative $425,000 in the example.
.
 Financing activities: This section includes the cash flows from borrowing and paying
debt, owners investing capital in the business and return of capital to them, and cash
dividends to owners, and the net cash increase or decrease from these activities for
the period — a positive $50,000 in the example.
The “bottom line” of the statement is the net cash increase or decrease from the three types
of activities reported in the statement — a positive $201,000 in the example. As you see in
Figure 8-4, this $201,000 increase is not the bottom line in the literal sense, because the begin-
ning cash balance is added to the net cash increase during the year to arrive at the ending bal-
ance of cash. The $201,000 increase in cash during the year is the bottom line in the sense that
the three main types of activities caused cash to increase this amount during the year.
Financial statement readers definitely want to know whether the company’s cash balance
increased or decreased during the year, and they want to know the principal reasons for the
increase or decrease. These are the reasons for reporting the statement of cash flows.
Many investment analysts and financial reporters — who should know better — take an
unadvisable shortcut to calculate a number they call cash flow from profit: Depreciation is
added to net income to produce cash flow from profit. However, it’s misleading to single out
depreciation as if it were the only factor that affects cash flow from profit. Depreciation
expense should be put in the broader context of all the asset and liability changes that affect
cash flow from profit. This is exactly the purpose of the first section of the statement of cash
flows that reports the cash flow from operating activities (see Figure 8-4).
Depreciation often is the largest factor for the difference between cash flow and net income,
as it is in the example shown in Figure 8-4. But changes in other assets and liabilities also
affect cash flow from profit. In some situations, these other changes overwhelm depreciation
and are the main reasons for the difference between cash flow and profit. For instance, a
business may lease all its fixed assets and have no depreciation expense.
A business needs to generate sufficient cash flow from profit to pay cash dividends to share-
owners. In Figure 8-4, the business generated $576,000 cash flow from profit for the year and
it paid out $250,000 cash dividends to its stockholders. This comparison is one of many the
reader of the statement of cash flows can make to judge the cash flow policies and decisions
of the business. Given that the business needed $425,000 for investments in fixed assets
during the year, should it have paid out such a large portion of its cash flow from profit? This
is just one of many important issues that creditors and shareowners should ponder in read-
ing a statement of cash flows.
Connecting Balance Sheet 
Changes with Cash Flows
As I have said more than once in this book, the three primary financial statements of a busi-
ness are intertwined and interdependent. The numbers in the statement of cash flows are
168
Part II: Preparing Financial Statements 

derived from the changes in the business’s balance sheet accounts during the year. Changes
in the balance sheet accounts drive the amounts reported in the statement of cash flows.
The lines of connection between changes in the business’s balance sheet accounts during
the year and the information reported in the statement of cash flows are shown in Figure 8-5.
Note that the $155,000 net increase in retained earnings is separated between the $405,000
net income for the year and the $250,000 cash dividends for the year: ($405,000 net income –
$250,000 dividends = $155,000 net increase in retained earnings).
Balance sheet account changes, such as those shown in Figure 8-5, are the basic building
blocks for preparing a statement of cash flows. These changes in assets, liabilities, and
owners’ equity accounts are the amounts reported in the statement of cash flows (as shown
in Figure 8-5), or the changes are used to determine the cash flow amounts (as in the case of
the change in retained earnings, which is separated into its net income component and its
dividends component).
Note in the cash flow from operating activities section in Figure 8-5 that net income is listed
first, then several adjustments are made to net income to determine the amount of cash flow
from operating activities. The assets and liabilities included in this section are those that are
part and parcel of the profit-making activity of a business. For example, the accounts receiv-
able asset is increased (debited) when sales are made on credit. The inventory asset account
is decreased (credited) when recording cost of goods sold expense. The accounts payable
account is increased (credited) when recording expenses that haven’t been paid. And so on.

Chapter 8: Reporting Cash Flows and Changes in Owners’ Equity

The rules for cash flow adjustments to net income are:
 An asset increase during the period decreases cash flow from profit
 A liability decrease during the period decreases cash flow from profit
 An asset decrease during the period increases cash flow from profit
 A liability increase during the period increases cash flow from profit
Following the third listed rule, the $191,000 depreciation expense for the year is a positive
adjustment, or add-back to net income — see Figure 8-4. Recording depreciation expense
reduces the book value of the fixed assets being depreciated. Well, to be more precise,
recording depreciation increases the balance of the accumulated depreciation contra
account that is deducted from the original cost of fixed assets. Recording depreciation does
not involve a cash outlay. The cash outlay occurred when the business bought the assets
being depreciated, which could be years ago.
This format of the cash flow from operating activities section shown in Figure 8-4 is referred
to as the indirect method (a rather technical term). The large majority of public businesses
use this method to report their cash flow from operating activities. However, the authorita-
tive accounting standard on this matter permits an alternative method for reporting cash
flow from operating activities, which is called the direct method (not that this term is any
clearer than the other). Very few businesses elect this alternative format, and I do not explain
it here. But you should know that a business has this option for reporting cash flow from
operating activities.

Chapter 8: Reporting Cash Flows and Changes in Owners’ Equity

Answers for Problems on Reporting Cash
Flows and Changes in Owners’ Equity
The following are the answers to the practice questions presented earlier in this chapter.
a
After you revise your net income answer (see the example question), the president tells you
that he has since talked with other directors of the business and realized that he was wrong
about the cash dividends. Now he’s fairly certain that $250,000 cash dividends were paid to
shareowners during 2007 and that the business issued additional capital stock shares for
$50,000. Based on this additional information, what amount of net income did the business 
earn in 2007?
Net income is $405,000. The net effect on owners’ equity is the same as in the example ques-
tion; the capital stock issue increases net worth $50,000 and the cash dividend decreases net
worth $250,000.
b
A business reports $500,000 net loss for the year just ended. It didn’t issue or retire any capital
stock shares during the year, and it didn’t pay cash dividends because of its loss in the year.
Did its net worth decrease $500,000 during the year? Did its cash balance decrease $500,000
during the year because of its loss?
Yes, net loss decreased net worth (owners’ equity) $500,000. There were no other transactions
that affected owners’ equity during the year (no capital stock issue and no cash dividends).
To determine whether its cash balance decreased $500,000 because of the business’s loss, you
need to know the changes in the assets and liabilities of the business that are affected by its
sales and expenses. You can’t answer this cash flow question without this information. If the
business didn’t record any depreciation expense in the year, and if the balances of the various
assets and liabilities affected by sales and expenses remained absolutely flat during the year,
then and only then would the loss decrease cash $500,000 during the year. But this is a highly
unlikely scenario for the business.
c
Can the net worth of a business go negative? If so, explain briefly how this may happen and if it
means that the business would have a negative cash balance.
Yes, the net worth of a business can go negative. A large enough loss in the year could wipe out
all owners’ equity and more, or repeated losses year after year could drive owners’ equity into
the negative column. Remember that a loss decreases the retained earnings balance of a busi-
ness. The loss for the year or cumulative losses over time can push retained earnings into a
large negative balance. The negative balance of retained earnings can become more than the
balance in the owners’ equity invested capital account. In this case, owners’ equity would be
negative.
Regarding the second question, you have to put your finger on what a negative cash balance is.
Usually, a negative cash balance refers to an overdrawn bank checking account balance in
which the business has written checks for more than exists in its account. Banks don’t typically
allow overdraws to happen and refuse to honor checks after the checking account balance is
drawn down to zero. However, a bank may tolerate a temporary negative balance for a good
customer, but a business with a negative owners’ equity hardly qualifies as a good customer.
Generally speaking, the cash balance of a business can’t go below zero (or, it can’t go negative).
d
Please refer to Figure 8-1 that presents the comparative balance sheet of the business and to
Figure 8-2 that presents its statement of changes in stockholders’ equity. Suppose the business
had paid $175,000 cash dividends (instead of $250,000) to stockholders in 2007. In this sce-
nario, which dollar amounts in the business’s comparative balance sheet would be different as
the result of this one change?
172
Part II: Preparing Financial Statements 

Just one relatively small difference, like the one in this problem, causes several changes in the
balance sheet. In the following answer, the amounts that are different are shaded so that you
can easily identify them.
e
Suppose the business in the example (see Figure 8-2) did not issue additional shares of capital
stock in 2007 and did not distribute dividends to its stockholders in either 2006 or 2007. In this
scenario, is the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity needed? Should it be presented in
the company’s 2007 annual financial report?
Well, if the business did prepare and report this statement it would look as follows:
You can make a good case that there’s no need for presenting the statement of changes in
stockholders’ equity in the company’s annual report because it contains so little information in
addition to what’s already in the comparative balance sheet. The statement does report that
net income is added to the retained earnings balance each year, but most financial statement
readers should understand this point.
On the other hand, one could argue that showing no dividends and no issue of capital stock
either year sends a message that the company is conserving its cash and presumably has a
need for the cash. On balance, therefore, most businesses would go ahead and report a state-
ment of changes in stockholders’ equity. If a reader isn’t interested enough to read the state-
ment, he or she can skip it. You never know; some business investors and creditors read every
financial statement and every footnote, and these people expect to see the statement of
changes in stockholders’ equity in the financial report.

Figure 8-3 presents a business’s comparative balance sheet that’s missing the information for
owners’ equity. Assume that the company didn’t issue additional capital stock shares during
the year and didn’t pay cash dividends to its shareowners during the year. Determine its net
income for the year 2007.
The company’s net income for 2007 is determined as follows:
The business didn’t issue capital stock and didn’t pay dividends during the year, so $19,000 is
its net income. In other words, the increase in net worth consists entirely of the increase in
retained earnings caused by net income for the year.
You may think the net income in this scenario is a rather paltry amount, and you’d be right.
Generally, a business expects to earn annual net income equal to 10 to 15 percent or more 
of its owners’ equity. Owners’ equity is the investment by the owners in the business, and the
owners expect to earn a return on their investment. Based on the $846,000 balance of owners’
equity at the start of 2007, a 15 percent return on investment would require about $127,000 net
income. The company had better improve its profit performance, or else.
g
From the information presented in Figure 8-3, determine the company’s cash flow from profit
(operating activities) for 2007.
Using the method of solving for the unknown factor you set up the problem as follows:
Summary of Cash Flows For the Year
Cash flow from operating activities
????
Cash flow from investing activities
($163,000)
Cash flow from financing activities
$75,000
Decrease in cash during the year
($31,000)
Solving for the unknown factor, cash flow from profit is $57,000 for the year. In Figure 8-3, you
can see that the company increased cash $75,000 from its notes payable transactions during
the year ($125,000 increase in long-term notes payable – $50,000 pay down on short-term 
notes payable = $75,000 net increase). The business didn’t raise money by issuing capital stock
during the year and didn’t pay cash dividends during the year. So the net cash increase from 
its financing activities is $75,000.  It spent $163,000 on property, plant and equipment (see
Figure 8-3). Therefore, cash flow from profit must have increased cash $57,000: ($57,000 cash
increase from profit – $163,000 capital expenditures + $75,000 cash from financing activities =
$31,000 decrease in cash during year). Did you follow all this? I hope so. Cash flow analysis 
isn’t for sissies, is it?

A company’s net worth decreased $425,000 during the year just ended. It didn’t pay cash divi-
dends during the year, and it didn’t issue or retire capital stock during the year. Determine its
profit or loss for the year.
All the decrease in net worth in this scenario must be due to the loss for the year. So, the
bottom-line is that the business suffered a $425,000 loss for the year.
Does this loss mean that bankruptcy is just around the corner? A loss doesn’t necessarily mean
that the business is out of cash and unable to pay its debts on time. The business could have
plenty of cash to buy time enough to correct its problems and move into the black. Then again,
if this is the tenth straight year of losses, the business may be hanging on by a thread and may
have to declare bankruptcy.
i
A company’s net worth decreased $585,000 during the year just ended. It didn’t pay cash divi-
dends during the year, but it issued additional capital stock shares during the year for $150,000.
Determine its profit or loss for the year.
The company’s net worth increased $150,000 from the issue of capital stock. If the business had
experienced a break-even year (sales revenue - expenses = zero), its net worth would have
increased $150,000. But, its net worth actually decreased $585,000 during the year. Therefore,
the company must have reported a $735,000 loss for the year.

The comparative balance sheet for a business (without its owners’ equity accounts) is pre-

The beginning and ending balances of certain accounts in a company’s balance sheet are as 
follows:
The business records $145,000 depreciation expense for the year and its net income is $258,000
for the year. Determine its cash flow from operating activities for the year. Present your answer
in the indirect format for cash flow from operating activities in the statement of cash flows.

Referring to the scenario in Question 11, assume that the facts remain the same except that the
business doesn’t record depreciation expense in the year. Instead, it leases all its fixed assets
and pays rent. The rent expense for the year is $145,000. (Note that the rent expense is the
same amount as depreciation expense in Question 11.) Determine its cash flow from operating
activities for the year. Present your answer for reporting cash flow from operating activities
according to the indirect format (as illustrated in Figure 8-4).
For added insight, compare this answer with the answer to Question 11. Cash flow from profit
in this situation is $145,000 less than in the scenario for Question 11 because the business
didn’t record depreciation expense. Instead, it paid $145,000 rent expense during the year.

Choosing Accounting Methods
In This Chapter
 Selecting the best cost of goods sold expense method for the business
 Depreciating in the fast and slow lanes
 Deciding when to bite the bad-debts bullet
You may think that two businesses that are identical in every financial respect and have
identical transactions during the year would report identical financial statements.
You’d be wrong. The two businesses would have identical financial statements only if they
made identical accounting choices, and that’s very unlikely. Different businesses make dif-
ferent accounting decisions.
Accounting is more than just reading the facts or interpreting the financial outcomes of busi-
ness transactions. Accounting also requires accountants to choose between alternative
accounting methods. Similar to the conservative states and liberal states addressed in poli-
tics, accounting has:
 Conservative accounting methods: These accounting methods delay the recording of
revenue and accelerate the recording of expenses. Profit is reported slowly.
 Liberal accounting methods: These accounting methods accelerate the recording of
revenue and delay the recording of expenses. Profit is reported quickly.
In rough terms, conservative accounting methods are pessimistic, and liberal methods are
optimistic. The choice of accounting methods also affects the values reported for assets, lia-
bilities, and owners’ equities in the balance sheet.
Accounting methods must stay within the boundaries of generally accepted accounting princi-
ples (GAAP). A business can’t conjure up accounting methods out of thin air. GAAP isn’t a
straitjacket; it leaves plenty of wiggle room, but the one fundamental constraint is that a busi-
ness must stick with its accounting method when it makes a choice. Consistency is the rule;
the same accounting methods must be used year after year. (The Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) allows businesses to change their accounting methods once in a while, but the justifica-
tion has to be persuasive.)
Getting Off to a Good Start
A new business with no accounting history has to make its accounting decisions for the first
time. If the business sells products, it has to select which cost of goods sold expense method
to use. If it owns fixed assets, it has to select which depreciation method to use. If it makes
sales on credit, it has to decide which bad debts expense method to use. These are three of
the many accounting decisions a business has to make.

The choices of accounting methods for these three expenses — cost of goods sold, deprecia-
tion, and bad debts — can make a sizable difference in the amount of profit or loss recorded
for the year. Choosing conservative accounting methods for these three expenses can cause
profit for the year to be lower by a relatively large percent compared with using liberal
accounting methods for the expenses. The comprehensive problems at the end of the chap-
ter demonstrate this point.
To explain these expense accounting methods I use a start-up business example. This new
business has no accounting history. It must make these expense accounting decisions for 
the first time. Assume that the business put off making these accounting choices until the
end of its first year. Everyone was very busy during the year getting the venture off the
ground. Furthermore, waiting until the end of the year gave management and the chief
accountant a year to learn more about the operating environment of the business and the
kinds of problems the business faces.
One year has passed; it’s now the end of the first year of business. One of the things a busi-
ness does at the end of the year is to prepare a listing of all its accounts, which serves as 
the main source of information for preparing its financial statements. Figure 9-1 presents 
the accounts of the company at the end of its first year of business. Note that the total of
accounts with debit balances equals the total of accounts with credit balances. (Chapter 3
explains debits and credits.) So, there are no bookkeeping errors (or, at least, none that
would cause these totals to be out of balance).

Review the company’s year-end listing of accounts’ balances shown in Figure 9-1.
a. How can you tell from this listing of accounts that the business has not recorded its following
three expenses for the year?
• Bad debts expense: Caused by uncollectible accounts receivable
• Cost of goods sold expense: For the cost of products sold; the revenue from these sales has
been recorded in the sales revenue account
• Depreciation expense: For the use of fixed assets (property, plant, and equipment) during
the year
b. Also, did you notice that there is no income tax expense account? What is the explanation for
this omission?
A.
a. Taking the expenses in the order listed:
• The ending balances in the bad debts expense account and in the allowance for doubtful
account are both zero. Therefore, no bad debts expense has been recorded
• The balance in the cost of goods sold expense account is zero; also, the balance in the inven-
tory account is very large compared with the balance in the sales revenue account.
Therefore, no cost of goods sold expense has been recorded
• The balance in the accumulated depreciation account is zero, and the balance in the depreci-
ation account is zero. Therefore, no depreciation expense has been recorded
b. The reason for no income tax expense is that this business is a pass-through entity for
income tax purposes. This means that its annual taxable income or loss is passed
through to its individual owners who pick up their respective shares of the taxable
income or loss in their individual income tax returns. The business itself doesn’t pay
income tax. (The main types of businesses that are pass-through income tax entities
are partnerships, small business corporations, and limited liability companies.)

Chapter 9: Choosing Accounting Methods
At this point the chief accountant sits down with top management to decide which account-
ing methods the business should use to record cost of goods sold expense, depreciation
expense, and bad debts expense. The financial statements for the first year cannot be pre-
pared until these accounting choices are made and the three expenses are recorded.

Determining Whether Products 
Are Unique or Fungible
In deciding on its cost of goods sold expense method of accounting, the first step a business
does is to determine whether the products it sells are fungible or unique. A unique product is
the only one of its kind; no other product is like it in all respects. For example, given the wide
range of options, equipment, colors, and models, every car on the lot of a new auto dealer
may be different. Another example of a business that sells unique products is a jeweler that
sells high priced rings, necklaces, brooches, and so on. Each piece is different than the others.
Fungible means that products are interchangeable and virtually indistinguishable from one
another. The products may have different serial numbers, but customers are indifferent
regarding which specific products they receive. Most products you buy in a grocery store or
fungible. The iPods that Apple sells are fungible. Apple sells different models of iPods, but
within each model category the products are fungible.
When the products it sells are unique, the business uses the specific identification method to
record cost of goods sold expense. The business keeps a separate record for the cost of each
product. The cost of each product is charged to cost of goods sold expense when that partic-
ular product is sold.
Generally speaking, unique (non-fungible) products are higher priced than fungible products.
Also, unique products are bought one at a time, whereas fungible products are bought in
batches. The cost per unit of each successive batch typically fluctuates over time. This
poses a dilemma; the business must choose which accounting method to use for recording
cost of goods sold expense, which the next section explains.
Contrasting Cost of Goods Sold Expense 
Methods (for Fungible Products)
Over the years, the accounting profession hasn’t managed to settle on just one method for
recording cost of goods sold expense and inventory cost (for fungible products). Different
methods have been allowed for many years. A business is entirely at liberty to choose
whichever method it wishes from among the generally approved methods, which are as 
follows
 Average cost method: The costs of different batches of products are averaged to deter-
mine cost of goods sold expense and ending inventory cost.
 First-in, first-out (FIFO) method: The costs of batches are charged to cost of goods
sold in the order the batches are acquired, and the cost of ending inventory is from the
most recent batch(es) acquired.
 Last-in, first-out (LIFO) method: The costs of batches are charged to cost of goods sold
in the reverse order that the batches were acquired, and the cost of ending inventory
is from the oldest batch(es) acquired.
The one universal rule is that a business can’t mark up its ending inventory (that is, its stock-
pile of unsold products on hand at the end of the year) to the current replacement cost
values of the products. In short, GAAP doesn’t allow market value appreciation of inventory
to be recorded.
181
Chapter 9: Choosing Accounting Methods

The cost per unit of products purchased (or manufactured) usually does not stay the same
from batch to batch. Usually the cost per unit fluctuates from batch to batch. This fluctua-
tion creates an accounting problem. Three different methods are used to deal with the fluc-
tuation of cost per unit from batch to batch, which I explain in the following sections. 
Figure 9-2 presents the history of products purchased by the business during its first year.
The business made five purchases, and the costs per unit (purchase prices) drifted up from
purchase to purchase. The business sells only one product, which minimizes the number
crunching. (Of course, most businesses sell a variety of products.) I use the information in
Figure 9-2 to illustrate the three methods of accounting for cost of goods sold and the cost of
inventory.

Q.
Suppose the business made five purchases
during the year. It bought 100,000 units of
the one product it sells. Suppose, further,
that the cost per unit in all five purchases
was the same. In other words, there was no
change in the purchase cost per unit
during the year. This is not too likely, but
this scenario provides is a good jumping
off point for explaining cost of goods sold
expense. During the year, the business sold
80,000 units of product. The revenue from
these sales was $4,585,000 (see the sales
revenue account in Figure 9-1). What
amount of gross profit (margin) did the
business earn from sales of products
during the year?
A.
To determine gross profit, you must first
determine the cost of the 80,000 units sold
during the year. In this scenario the pur-
chase cost per unit of the products sold by
the business remained constant during the
year. So, there is only one method to deter-
mine cost of goods sold: (80,000 units
sold/100,000 units purchased x $3,725,000
cost of purchases = $2,980,000 cost of
goods sold). In other words, 80 percent of
the goods purchased and available for sale
were sold during the year and, therefore,
80 percent of the total cost of purchases
should be charged to cost of goods sold.
The following journal entry is made:
Cost of goods sold expense
$2,980,000
Inventory
$2,980,000
Therefore, the gross margin for the year is:
Sales revenue
$4,585,000
Cost of goods sold expense
$2,980,000
Gross margin
$1,605,000
From the listing of accounts in Figure 9-1, you can see that the company’s inventory account
has a relatively large balance. Product purchases during the year were debited in this account,
but no credits have been made for the cost of goods sold during the year. Clearly, the appro-
priate amount should be removed from the inventory asset account and charged to cost of
goods sold expense account.

Averaging things out
Many accountants argue that when the acquisition cost per unit fluctuates the thing to
do is to use the average cost of products to determine cost of goods sold expense. The
logic of the average cost method goes like this: Five batches of products were pur-
chased at different prices, so it’s best to lump together all five purchases and deter-
mine the average cost per unit. From the data in Figure 9-2, the average cost per unit
purchased during the year is calculated as follows:
$3,725,000 total cost of purchases ÷ 100,000 units = $37.25 average cost per unit
The cost of goods sold expense for the products sold during the year is calculated as
follows:
80,000 units sold during year × $37.25 average cost per unit = $2,980,000 cost of
goods sold expense
Alternatively, if you know that the business sold 80,000 of the 100,000 units available
during the year, you can calculate cost of goods sold expense the following way:
(80,000 ÷ 100,000) × $3,725,000 total cost of purchases = $2,980,000 cost of goods
sold expense
Unless you’ve been asleep at the wheel, you should have noticed that the average
cost method gives the same answer for cost of goods sold expense as in the example
scenario just above in which it is assumed that the purchase cost per unit remained
the same during the year. That’s the effect of calculating an average. The five different
costs per unit figures (see Figure 9-2) are condensed to one average number, as if this
had been the cost per unit during the year.
Using the average cost method, the $37.25 average cost per unit is used for the com-
pany’s 20,000 units of ending inventory (100,000 units acquired less 80,000 units sold):
20,000 units of inventory × $37.25 average cost per unit = $745,000 cost of ending
inventory
Summing up, the $3,725,000 total cost of products purchased during the first year of
business is divided between $2,980,000 cost of goods sold expense and $745,000 cost
of ending inventory. 
The average cost method is not as easy to use in actual practice as this example may
suggest. With this method, you face questions such as how often should you deter-
mine the average cost per unit? Should you calculate the average just once a year,
once each quarter, or once each month? Before computers came along, calculating an
average cost per unit was a pain in the posterior.

5.
During its first year, a business made seven acquisitions of a product that it sells. Figure 9-3 presents
the history of these purchases. Compare the purchases history in Figure 9-3 with the one in Figure 9-2.
Does the average cost method make more sense or seem more persuasive in one case over the other?
6.
Refer to the purchase history in Figure 9-3. The bookkeeper said he was using the average cost
method. He calculated the average of the seven purchase costs per unit and multiplied this average
unit cost by the 158,100 units sold during the year. His average cost per unit is $24.76 (rounded). Is
this the correct way to apply the average cost method? If not, what is the correct answer for cost of

Part II: Preparing Financial Statements 

Going with the flow: The FIFO method
My Uncle Fred worked many years on the receiving and shipping docks of several businesses.
If you asked Fred how to calculate the cost of goods sold, he would point out that the first
goods into inventory are the first to be delivered to customers when products are sold. In
other words, the sequence follows a first-in, first-out order. Businesses don’t buy an initial
stock of products, put them away in a dark corner, and then take a long time to deliver these
products to customers. (Well, wineries may be an exception to this general rule.) The first-in,
first-out flow of products delivered to customers means that the business’s inventory of
products at the end of the year comes from its most recent purchase(s).
The first-in, first-out (FIFO) method of determining cost of goods sold expense follows the flow
of products taken out of inventory for delivery to customers. In the example, 80,000 units 
of product were sold to customers. The calculation of the $2,925,000 total cost assigned to
these products by the FIFO method is shown in Figure 9-4. The first 24,000 units sold are
assigned a cost of $35.40 per unit, or $849,600; the next 22,500 units sold are assigned a cost
of $35.44 per unit, or $797,400; and so on.
The entry to record cost of goods sold expense for the year using the FIFO method is 
Cost of goods sold expense
$2,925,000
Inventory
$2,925,000
In internal accounting reports to managers, the accountant presents the cost per unit sold
and compares it with the sales price during the year to determine the profit margin per unit.
Using the FIFO method, the cost per unit sold is:
$2,925,000 cost of goods sold ÷ 80,000 units sold = $36.5625, or $36.56 rounded cost per
unit sold during year
This cost per unit sold doesn’t equal any of the five acquisition costs, nor does it equal the
average cost per unit purchased during the year, which is $37.25. Business managers are
used to dealing with averages, so this discrepancy shouldn’t be a problem — although,
whenever you’re dealing with an average, it’s important to know and take into account how
the average is determined.
What about ending inventory? By the FIFO method, the cost of ending inventory equals the
cost of the most recent acquisition(s) — because the cost of earlier acquisitions are charged to
cost of goods sold expense for the year. In the example, $2,925,000 is charged to cost of goods
sold expense, which leaves a remainder of $800,000 in the inventory account: ($3,725,000 cost
of purchases during the year – $2,925,000 to cost of goods sold = $800,000 cost of inventory).
The cost of ending inventory is based on the cost of the last, or fifth, purchase and consists of
20,000 units at $40.00 cost per unit for the total cost of $800,000 (data from Figure 9-2). The
total quantity of the last (fifth) purchase was 23,500 units (3,500 units were charged to cost of
goods sold expense, and the other 20,000 units remain in ending inventory).

In the example shown in Figure 9-3, the pur-

over successive acquisitions, and the quan-
tities purchased each time vary quite a bit.
Do these two factors play a role in the
choice of a cost of goods sold method?
Solve It
Going against the flow: The LIFO method
The FIFO method (see the preceding section) has a lot going for it: It follows the actual
sequence of products delivered out of inventory to customers, and it’s relatively straightfor-
ward to apply. But (and this is a very big but), federal income tax law allows businesses to
use an opposite method to determine annual taxable income. This feature of the tax law has
led to the widespread adoption of the method, called last-in, first-out, or LIFO. The method
reverses the sequence in which products sold are removed from inventory and charged to
cost of goods sold expense.
Figure 9-5 shows how the cost of 80,000 units sold is calculated by the LIFO method. In accor-
dance with the reverse sequence basis of LIFO, the purchases batches are listed in reverse
chronological order. The logic behind the LIFO method is that products sold must be replaced
in order to stay in business. The closest approximations to replacement costs are the costs
of the most recent purchases.
The entry to record cost of goods sold expense for the year using the LIFO method is
Cost of goods sold expense
$3,017,000
Inventory
$3,017,000

Using the LIFO method in internal reports to managers, the cost per unit sold for the year is
$3,017,000 cost of goods sold ÷ 80,000 units sold = $37.7125, or $37.71 rounded cost per
unit sold during year
As with the FIFO method, the LIFO average cost per unit sold doesn’t equal any of the five
acquisition costs, nor does it equal the average cost per unit purchased during the year,
which is $37.25. Business managers are used to dealing with averages, though, so this dis-
crepancy shouldn’t be a problem. However, whenever dealing with an average, it is impor-
tant to know how the average is determined and take that information into account.
What about ending inventory? The cost of ending inventory by the LIFO method depends on
whether the business during the year increased the number of products held in inventory.
Assume that the business did in fact increase its quantity of inventory (it acquired more
units than it sold during the year). In this case, the cost of ending inventory equals the cost
of its beginning inventory and the cost of the additional units, which is based on the per unit
costs from the earliest acquisitions during the year. On the other hand, when a business
decreases its inventory during the year its ending inventory cost is based on the cost(s) per
unit in its beginning inventory. 
In the example, the cost of ending inventory is $708,000: ($3,725,000 cost of purchases during
the year – $3,017,000 to cost of goods sold = $708,000 cost of inventory). In other words, the
cost of its ending inventory comes from the oldest purchase and consists of 20,000 units at
$35.40 cost per unit for a total cost of $708,000.
In the example, the ending balance sheet reports inventory at $708,000 cost value by the
LIFO method versus $800,000 cost value by the FIFO method, which is a fairly sizable differ-
ence. FIFO gives a more up-to-date inventory cost in the balance sheet. But, nevertheless,
many businesses use LIFO because it minimizes taxable income in their federal income tax
returns (assuming an inflationary trend of acquisition costs over time). Reporting ending
inventory based on the earliest acquisition cost is the Achilles’ heel of the LIFO method.
Assume a business has been using LIFO for, say, 40 years. This means that some part of its
inventory cost goes back to costs it paid 40 years ago. (As a matter of fact, Caterpillar Inc.
has been using LIFO for more than 50 years.) If the difference between the current cost value
of inventory (as measured by FIFO) and the LIFO cost is significant the business discloses
this discrepancy in a footnote to its financial statements.

Appreciating Depreciation Methods
The basic theory of depreciation accounting is unarguable: The amount of capital a business
invests in a fixed asset, less its estimated future residual (salvage) value when it will be dis-
posed of, should be allocated in a rational and systematic manner over its estimated useful
life to the business.
A fixed asset’s cost shouldn’t be charged entirely to expense in the year the asset’s acquired.
Doing so would heavily penalize the year of acquisition and relieve future years from any
share of the cost. But the opposite approach is equally bad: The business shouldn’t wait
until a fixed asset is eventually disposed of to record the expense of using the asset. Doing so
would heavily penalize the final year and relieve earlier years from any share of the fixed
asset’s cost.
Essentially, cost less residual value should be apportioned to every year of the fixed asset’s
use. (Land has perpetual life, and therefore, its cost isn’t depreciated.) The theory of depreci-
ation is relatively simple, but the devil is in the details. And, I mean details!
Frankly, there’s not much point in discussing the finer points of depreciation accounting. I
could refer you to many books written by accounting scholars on depreciation. But as a prac-
tical matter the federal income tax law dictates the depreciation methods and practices used
by most businesses. The IRS publication “How To Depreciate Property” (2005 edition) runs
112 pages. You ought to read this pamphlet — if you have the time, and the stamina.
Let me step on the soapbox for a moment. The depreciation provisions in the income tax law
are driven mainly by political and economic incentives, to encourage businesses to upgrade
and modernize their investments in long-term operating assets. By and large, businesses
follow income tax regulations on depreciation. As the result, useful lives for depreciating
fixed assets are too short, salvage value is generally ignored, and depreciation is stacked
higher in the early years. In other words: fixed assets generally last longer than their income

tax depreciation lives; when disposed of fixed assets often have some salvage value; and, a
strong case can be made for allocating an equal amount of depreciation to each year over the
useful life of many fixed assets. In short, actual depreciation practices deviate from deprecia-
tion theory. Okay, I’m off my soapbox now.
Figure 9-1 shows the accounts of a business at the end of its first year of operations. No
depreciation expense for the year has been recorded yet, but obviously, some amount of
depreciation must be recorded. The business purchased all its fixed assets during the first
week of the year, and the assets were placed in service immediately, so the business is enti-
tled to record a full year’s depreciation on its fixed assets. (Special partial-year rules apply
when assets are placed in service at other times during the year.)
The company’s plant, property, and equipment account consists of the following components:
Land
$150,000
Building
$468,000
Machines
$532,000
Total
$1,150,000
The cost of land is not depreciated. Land stays on the books at original cost as long as the
business owns the land. Ownership of land is a right in perpetuity, which does not come to
an end. Land does not wear out in the physical sense, and generally holds its economic value
over time. Buildings, machines and other fixed assets, on the other hand, wear out with use
over time and generally reach a point where they have no economic value.
Assume the business decides to maximize the amount of depreciation recorded in the year,
according to the provisions of the income tax law.
189
Chapter 9: Choosing Accounting Methods
Q.
What depreciation amounts for the year
should be recorded on the business’s
building and machines?
A.
Under the federal income tax law, the cost
of a building used by a business in its oper-
ations is depreciated over 39 years by the
straight-line depreciation method of alloca-
tion. Therefore, the depreciation on the
building for the year equals $12,000
($468,000 cost ÷ 39 years = $12,000 depreci-
ation per year).
Under the federal income tax law, the
machines used by the business fall into the
seven-year useful life class, and they can
be (but don’t have to be) depreciated by
the double-declining balance method of allo-
cation. This is an accelerated depreciation
method of allocation that front-loads depre-
ciation, which means that more deprecia-
tion is allocated to the early years and less
to the later years of the asset’s useful life.
The applicable percent for the first year is
double the straight-line rate. Therefore, 
2⁄7 of the cost of the machines is charged to
depreciation in the first year: $532,000 ×
2⁄7 = $152,000 depreciation in the first year.
In years two, three, and four, the percent is the same but is applied on the declining balance,
which equals cost less accumulated depreciation at the start of the year. So, for example, in
the second year, 2⁄7 is multiplied by the original cost of the machines minus the first year’s
depreciation. The business converts to the straight-line depreciation method for the last
three years. In these three years, the straight-line depreciation amount is higher on the
declining balance than the amount determined by the accelerated rate. By switching to the
straight-line depreciation method for the last three years, the original cost of the machines
is fully depreciated over the seven-year life of the assets. (Cost wouldn’t be fully depreci-
ated if the accelerated rate were used in the last three years.)

amounts on the machines for years two
through seven according to the double
declining accelerated depreciation method.
Also, determine the declining balance of

assets.

Timing Bad Debts Expense
Most businesses extend credit to others, whether that means making sales on credit to other
businesses, loaning money to their officers, or loaning money to their vendors and employ-
ees. The act of extending credit is backed by some good business reasons, but businesses
that do so also take the risk of not being paid. Some debtors may not pay up or pay the full
amount owed. Retailers have to live with some amount of shoplifting losses, despite their
best efforts to prevent it. In like manner, businesses that extend credit to their customers
and make loans have to live with some amount of bad debts expense, despite their best
efforts to screen customers and to collect overdue debts. Bad debts is the general term for
these uncollectible receivables.
A business has two options for how it records its bad debts expense:
 Specific write-off method: No entry is made for bad debts expense until specific
receivables are actually written-off as uncollectible. A receivable is not written off until
every conceivable collection effort has been made and the debt has been discharged
through bankruptcy proceedings or until the customer (or other debtor) has vanished
and can’t be traced. One disadvantage of this method is that the receivables asset
could be overstated because specific accounts have not as yet been identified as 
uncollectible that will in fact prove to be uncollectible in the future.
 Allowance method: Based on its collection experience with its credit customers 
(and other debtors) a business records bad debts expense before individual, specific
receivables are identified as being uncollectible. The business estimates its bad debts
expense, before all the facts are in regarding which particular receivables will have to
be written-off as uncollectible. This is a more conservative method than the specific
write-off method because bad debts expense is recorded sooner. One disadvantage is
that the future amount of bad debts (receivables that will eventually be written-off) has
to be estimated. Another disadvantage is that the income tax law does not permit this
method to be used by most businesses.

From the data in Figure 9-1, you can see that the business’s accounts receivable balance is
$645,000 at year-end. The business hasn’t loaned money to employees, officers, or vendors.
(Non-customer loans are recorded in other accounts, such as loans to officers.) The business
didn’t write off any customers’ receivables during the year; however, at year-end, the amounts
owed to the business by a few customers are several months overdue. The business shut off
credit to these customers and sent them dun (please pay now) letters. The customers have
assured the business that they will pay but just need more time, so they say.
The business has done everything it can to get the customers to pay up, short of bringing
legal action. As far as the business knows, none of these customers have declared bank-
ruptcy, but the business has heard a rumor that one customer has contacted a lawyer about
bankruptcy. The total amount overdue from these deadbeat customers is $18,500, and the
business is of the opinion that the $18,500 will not be collected.
In addition, some other customers are two or three months overdue in paying their accounts.
The business understands that some of these debts may end up being uncollectible, but it’s
still hopeful that these overdue accounts will be collected in full.

Chapter 9: Choosing Accounting Methods
Q.
Given the preceding background information, how much bad debts expense should the business
record at the end of its first year according to:
a. the specific write-off method for bad debts expense
b. the allowance method for bad debts expense (see information below for this part of the question)?
A.
Frankly, coming up with a bad debts expense amount for the year under either bad debts expense
accounting method is somewhat arbitrary. Only time will tell exactly how much of the total
$645,000 accounts receivable will not be collected.
a. The $18,500 seriously overdue amount of accounts receivable is written off by the specific
write-off method for recording bad debts expense. The entry is as follows :
Bad Debts Expense
$18,500
Accounts Receivable
$18,500
The specific accounts receivable making up this $18,500 have been identified. Considering that
the company has identified specific customers and made reasonable efforts to collect the
amounts owed to it, the receivables should be written off and charged to bad debts expense.
This amount of expense is allowed for federal income tax purposes.
After making this write-off entry, the accounts receivable balance is $626,500 ($645,000 bal-
ance before write off – $18,500 write off = $626,500 adjusted balance of accounts receivable).
Some of this total amount of accounts receivable probably will turn out to be uncollectible.
But the specific write-off method does not record these future write-offs at this time. The
bad debts expense for the first year is $18,500 and the accounts receivable balance reported
in its year-end balance sheet is $626,500.
b. Using the allowance method for recording bad debts expense an additional amount of bad
debts expense is recorded for the yet-to-be identified uncollectible receivables. Of course, the
accountant has to estimate the amount of future write-offs. (The argument is that some esti-
mate is better than none.) Suppose a conservative estimate of these additional bad debts is
$20,000. However, specific customers’ accounts haven’t been identified for this estimated bad
debts amount.

13. The chief accountant of the business out-
lined in the example question is from the
double-breasted, dull grey suit, old guard
school of accounting. He argues that a cus-
tomer’s account receivable should be writ-
ten off as uncollectible when it becomes
more than 30 days old. The normal credit
term offered by the business to customers
is 30 days. At the end of its first year,
$278,400 of the company’s $645,000
accounts receivable is more than 30 days
old. What bad debts expense entry would
the chief accountant make at the end of the
year if he had his way? Do you agree with
his approach?

14. The president of the business outlined in
the example question attends an industry
update seminar at which the speaker says
that the average bad debts experience of
businesses in this field is about 1 percent
of sales. Assume that the business adopts
this method. Determine its bad debts
expense for the first year and for the bal-
ances in its accounts receivable and
allowance for doubtful accounts at the end
of the year.
Solve It
During the year, $18,500 has already been recorded in the bad debts expense account. As the
specific receivables were identified as uncollectible during the year the business had no choice
but to write-off the receivables and record bad debts expense. Using the allowance method the
accountant makes the following additional entry at the end of the year, which increases the bad
debts expense account:
Bad Debts Expense
$20,000
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
$20,000
The Allowance for Doubtful Accounts account is the contra account to the accounts receivable
asset account. Its balance is deducted from the asset account’s balance in the balance sheet.
After giving effect to this year-end entry, the company’s bad debts expense for the year is
$38,500 ($18,500 actually written-off during the year + $20,000 estimated uncollectible receiv-
ables to be written-off in the future). In its year-end balance sheet the business reports accounts
receivable at $626,500 and the $20,000 balance in the allowance for doubtful account is
deducted from accounts receivable. So, the net amount of accounts receivables in its ending
balance sheet is $606,500.
The IRS doesn’t allow most businesses to use the allowance bad debts expense method to
determine annual taxable income. (This is a terrible pun, isn’t it?) Under the income tax rules,
specific accounts receivable must actually be written off in order to deduct bad debts as 
an expense for determining taxable income. (For more information, you can refer to IRS
Publication 535, “Business Expenses” (2005), and pay particular attention to the chapter on
business bad debts.)

The following two questions are comprehensive for this chapter. They draw upon the discus-
sion throughout the chapter and the answers to the example questions in the chapter. In
answering these two comprehensive questions you should also refer to the figures in the
chapter.

Answers to Problems on Choosing 
Accounting Methods
The following are the answers to the practice questions presented earlier in this chapter.
a
Does the interest expense in Figure 9-1 look reasonable, or does it need an adjustment at the
end of the year?
Asking this kind of question at the end of the year is always a good thing for an accountant to
do, to make sure than no account that needs adjustment at year-end is overlooked. In this situa-
tion, interest expense is $55,250 (see Figure 9-1). The sum of the business’s two notes payable
accounts in the year-end listing of accounts is $850,000. From Figure 9-1, you don’t know for
sure whether these two notes payable were borrowed for the entire year. Assuming that the
notes were outstanding the entire year, the following applies:
$55,250 interest expense ÷ $850,000 notes payable = 6.5 percent annual interest rate
If the notes payable were outstanding for less than the full year, then the effective annual inter-
est rate would be higher. Ultimately, the interest expense account probably doesn’t need
adjusting at the end of the year. The business probably has recorded all interest expense for
the year, so it’s unlikely that an adjusting entry needs to be recorded at year-end for interest
expense.
b
In Figure 9-1 the Owners’ Equity — Retained Earnings account has a zero balance. Why?
The final entry of the year is the closing entry in which the net profit or loss for the year is
entered into the retained earnings account. The closing entry isn’t made until all expenses for
the year are recorded. Because the business has just concluded its first year, its retained earn-
ings account had a zero balance at the start of the year. The closing entry to transfer net profit
or loss for the year into the account hasn’t been made, so retained earnings still has a zero bal-
ance. After the accountant records net profit or loss into retained earnings, the account will
have a balance, of course.
c
In Figure 9-1, note the Prepaid Expenses asset account at the end of the year. What are three
examples of such prepaid costs? Are the methods for allocating these costs to expense fairly
objective and noncontroversial?
Three examples of prepaid expenses are:
• Insurance premiums: Paid in advance of the insurance coverage. When the premium is paid,
the amount is recorded in the prepaid expenses asset account and then the cost is allocated
to each month of insurance coverage.
• Office and operating supplies: Bought in quantities that last several months. The cost of
these purchases is recorded in the prepaid expenses asset account and then allocated to
expense as the supplies are used.
• Property taxes: Paid at the beginning of the tax year in some states, counties, and cities. The
tax paid for the coming year is recorded in the prepaid expenses asset account and then allo-
cated to property tax expense each month or quarter.
Generally speaking, the allocation of these and other prepaid expenses is objective and noncon-
troversial. Different accountants use the same allocation methods. However, most businesses
don’t bother to record relatively minor prepaid costs in the asset account and instead record
the costs immediately as expenses. For example, a business may give its delivery truck drivers
quarters to feed parking meters as they make deliveries to customers. Theoretically, the
amount shouldn’t be recorded as an expense until the quarters are actually used, but most
companies record the expense as soon as they distribute the quarters.
194
Part II: Preparing Financial Statements 

d
In Figure 9-1, note the Accrued Expenses Payable liability account at the end of the year. What
are three examples of such accrued costs? Are the methods for allocating these costs to
expense fairly objective and noncontroversial?
Three examples of accrued costs are:
• Vacation and sick pay: Businesses should accrue the costs of vacation and sick pay that are
“earned” by their employees each pay period. (I stress the word “earned” because the actual
accumulation of these employee benefits may not be clear-cut and definite. If the business
has a collective bargaining contract with its employees these benefits usually are well-
defined.)
• Warranties and guarantees: Most products sold by businesses come with a warranty or guar-
antee. After the point of sale, the business incurs costs to service, repair, or replace a product
under the terms of its warranty or guarantee. The business should forecast the future costs of
fulfilling these obligations.
• Property taxes: The business should determine the amount of the property taxes that are
paid at the end of the tax year (in arrears) and accumulate the expense during the year. 
The accrual of these and other costs isn’t cut and dried and tends to be somewhat controver-
sial. The allocation of accrued costs has many shades of gray — there aren’t any “bright” lines
to delineate which particular costs should be accrued and which ones don’t have to be.
e
During its first year, a business made seven acquisitions of a product that it sells. Figure 9-3
presents the history of these purchases. Compare the purchases history in Figure 9-3 with the
one in Figure 9-2. Does the average cost method make more sense or seem more persuasive in
one case over the other?
This is a hard question to answer, to be frank, because the appropriateness of the average cost
method depends on how you look at it. You could argue that you have a little more reason to
use the average cost method in the Figure 9-3 scenario because the purchase price bounces up
and down, whereas in the Figure 9-2 scenario, the purchase prices are on an upward trend. But,
by and large, accountants do not consider whether prices fluctuate up and down or are on a
steady up escalator in making the decision to use the average cost method. Accountants like
the “leveling out” effect of the average cost method. This is main reason why they prefer the
method.
f
Refer to the purchase history in Figure 9-3. The bookkeeper said he was using the average cost
method. He calculated the average of the seven purchase costs per unit and multiplied this
average unit cost by the 158,100 units sold during the year. His average cost per unit is $24.76
(rounded). Is this the correct way to apply the average cost method? If not, what is the correct
answer for cost of goods sold expense for the year?
The bookkeeper made a mistake because the average cost method doesn’t use the simple aver-
age of purchases prices. The average cost method uses the weighted average of acquisition
prices, which means that each purchase price is weighted by the quantity bought at that price.
In the Figure 9-3 scenario, the $26.15 purchase price carries much less weight because only
6,100 units were bought at this price. The $23.05 purchase price carries more weight because
36,500 units were bought at this price.
The correct average cost per unit is calculated as follows:
($4,493,140 total cost of purchases ÷ 186,000 units purchased) = $24.1567, or
$24.16 rounded
Therefore, the correct cost of goods sold expense for the period is $3,819,169. You can calcu-
late this amount by multiplying the exact average cost per unit by the 158,100 units sold, or you
can calculate it as follows:
(158,100 units sold ÷ 186,000 units available for sale) × $4,493,140 total cost of
goods available for sale = $3,819,169 cost of goods sold expense

Figure 9-3 presents the inventory acquisition history of a business for its first year. The busi-
ness sold 158,100 units during the year. By the FIFO method, determine its cost of goods sold
expense for the year and its cost of ending inventory.
The cost of goods sold expense by the FIFO method is determined as follows:
The cost of ending inventory includes some units from the sixth purchase and all units from the
seventh purchase, which is summarized in the following schedule:
h
In the example shown in Figure 9-3, the purchase cost per unit bounces up and down over suc-
cessive acquisitions, and the quantities purchased each time vary quite a bit. Do these two fac-
tors play a role in the choice of a cost of goods sold method?
Generally speaking, the volatility of acquisition costs per unit isn’t a critical factor in choosing
a cost of goods sold expense method, nor is the variation in acquisition quantities. The reasons
for selecting one method over another don’t depend on these two factors.
i
Figure 9-3 presents the inventory acquisition history of a business for its first year. The busi-
ness sold 158,100 units during the year. By the LIFO method, determine its cost of goods sold
expense for the year and its cost of ending inventory.
The cost of goods sold expense as determined by the LIFO is as follows:
The cost of ending inventory includes all the units from the first purchase and some from the
second purchase, which is summarized as follows:

units that it had available for sale during the year. In this situation, does the business’s choice
of cost of goods sold expense method make any difference?
No, all three methods (average cost, FIFO, and LIFO) give the same result. The $4,493,140 total
purchase cost of the 186,000 units would be charged to cost of goods sold expense.

Determine the annual depreciation amounts on the machines for years two through seven
according to the double declining method. Also, determine the book value (cost less accumu-
lated depreciation) at the end of each year.
The complete depreciation schedule of the machines over their estimated seven years of life is
presented as follows:
Note the “Cost less Accumulated Depreciation at Start of Year” column in the schedule. These
are the book values of the asset at the start of each year, which are the same as the book value
at the end of the previous year. For instance, the $380,000 book value at the start of year 2 is
the same as the book value at the end of year 1. And so on. At the end of year 7 the book value
is down to zero, because the $532,000 accumulated depreciation equals the original cost of the
asset.
l
Instead of using the double-declining depreciation method for its machines, suppose the busi-
ness used the straight-line depreciation method over seven years. Determine the year-by-year
difference in bottom-line profit with the straight-line depreciation method. (Remember that the
business doesn’t pay income tax because it’s a pass-through tax entity.)

Chapter 9: Choosing Accounting Methods

If the chief accountant had his way, he would make the following entry:
Bad Debts Expense
$278,400
Accounts Receivable
$278,400
I certainly don’t agree with writing off such a large amount of accounts receivable. In the real
world of business, many customers don’t pay on time; indeed, late payment by some customers
is expected any time credit’s extended. The business would like to receive all payments for its
credit sales on time, of course, but it knows that many of its customers probably won’t make their
payments within 30 days. The chief accountant needs to get real and understand that many cus-
tomers slip beyond the 30-day credit period but eventually pay for their purchases.
n
The president of the business outlined in the example question attends an industry update
seminar at which the speaker says that the average bad debts experience of businesses in this
field is about 1 percent of sales. Assume the business adopts this method. Determine its bad
debts expense for the first year and for the balances in its accounts receivable and allowance
for doubtful accounts at the end of the year.
The year-end adjusting entry is as follows:
Bad Debts Expense
$45,850
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
$45,850
To record bad debts expense equal to 1.0% of total sales for year.
The business also records the write off specific customers’ accounts that have been identified
as uncollectible. The write-off entry is as follows:
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
$18,500
Accounts Receivable
$18,500
To record write off of uncollectible accounts.
Based on the information provided in the example, using 1 percent of sales to estimate bad
debts expense seems too high for this particular business. And, as I mention in the chapter, the
IRS doesn’t allow the allowance method for income tax purposes.

Managerial, Manufacturing,
and Capital Accounting 

In this part . . .
T
he first chapter in this part explains the accountant’s
essential role in helping business managers do 
their jobs well. In broad terms, managers need financial
information for planning, control, and decision-making.
Accountants should develop profit analysis models that
managers can use efficiently — so they make optimal deci-
sions based on the key factors that drive profit.
For manufacturing businesses, accountants have the addi-
tional function of determining the product cost of the
goods produced by the business. In Chapter 11, I explain
plain words manufacturing cost accounting fundamentals.
The chapter explains the importance of calculating the
burden rate for indirect fixed manufacturing overhead
costs that is included in product cost, and how production
output (not just sales) affects profit for the period.
Chapter 12 explains nominal and effective interest rates,
how compounding works both for and against you, 
and return on investment (ROI) measures. At their core,
interest and investment ratios are based on accounting
methods.

usiness managers need a sure analytical grip on the fundamental factors that drive
profit. And because profit is an accounting measure, chief accountants should help the
business’s managers understand and analyze profit performance. The trick is not to over-
load managers with so much detail that they can’t see the forest for the trees.
Now, don’t get me wrong. Detail is necessary for management control; managers need to keep
their eyes on a thousand and one details, any one of which can spin out of control and cause
serious damage to profit performance. But too much detail is the enemy of profit analysis for
planning and decision-making. Management control requires gobs of detailed information.
Management decision-making, in contrast, needs condensed and global information pre-
sented in a compact package that the manager can get his or her head around without get-
ting sidetracked by too many details.
The profit analysis methods that I discuss in this chapter can be done on the back of an
envelope. All you need for the number crunching is a basic hand-held calculator. More elabo-
rate and detail-rich profit analysis methods need to be done on computers. These sophisti-
cated profit analysis methods have their place, but before they delve into technical profit
analysis, managers should be absolutely clear on the fundamental factors that determine
profit. The idea is to make sure one knows how to read the dashboard before going under the
hood and taking apart the engine.
This chapter tackles three main questions:
 How did the business make its profit?
 How can the business improve its profit performance?
 How would unfavorable changes affect the business’s profit performance?
Mapping Profit for Managers
Figure 10-1 lays out an internal profit (P&L) report for the business’s managers. The revenue
and expense information is for the most recent year of a business that I call Company A. 
(I introduce two other business examples later in this chapter and call them Company B and
Company C.) An internal profit report should serve as a profit map that shows managers 
how to get to their profit destination. The profit report in Figure 10-1 is very condensed; it’s
stripped down to bare essentials. It includes the five fundamental factors that drive profit
performance. These key profit drivers are the following:

 Sales volume, or the total number of units sold during the period
 Sales revenue per unit (sales price)
 Cost of goods sold expense per unit (product cost)
 Variable operating expenses per unit
 Fixed operating expenses for the period
The other dollar amounts in the profit report (Figure 10-1) depend on these five profit driv-
ers. For instance, the $24,000,000 sales revenue amount equals the 120,000 units sales
volume times the $200 sales revenue per unit (or sales price). And, the $25 fixed operating
expenses per unit amount equals the $3,000,000 total fixed operating expenses for the period
divided by the 120,000 units sales volume.
Don’t confuse the internal profit report presented in Figure 10-1 with the income statement in
the external financial reports a business distributes to its owners and creditors. (I discuss
externally reported financial statements in Chapters 5, 6, and 8.) The internal profit report
(Figure 10-1) includes sales volume and per unit values, which aren’t disclosed in externally
reported income statements. Also, the internal profit report separates operating expenses
into variable and fixed categories, which isn’t done in externally reported income statements.
The last line in Figure 10-1 is operating profit, which is profit before interest and income tax.
Interest and income tax are deducted to reach a business’s final, bottom-line net income.
Income tax is a very technical topic, which makes it difficult to generalize. Some businesses
are pass-through entities and don’t pay income tax directly. Some businesses receive special
tax breaks, and some businesses operate overseas where income taxes are quite different
than in the United States.
Standard terminology doesn’t exist in the area of management profit reporting and analysis.
Instead of gross margin, you may see gross profit. Instead of operating profit, you may see oper-
ating earnings or earnings before interest and income tax (EBIT). You may even see other
terms than these. Despite the diversity of terminology, in the context of a profit report, the
meanings of terms used are usually clear enough.
Before using the five profit factors for analyzing profit performance, a good thing to do is to
“walk down the profit ladder” in the internal profit report (Figure 10-1). The top rung of the
ladder is sales revenue, which equals sales price times sales volume. You can think of sales
revenue as profit before any expenses are deducted. If the business sells products, the first

expense deducted against sales revenue is cost of goods sold, which equals product cost
(cost of goods sold expense per unit) times sales volume. (Chapter 9 explains the different
accounting methods for recording this expense.) Deducting cost of goods sold from sales
revenue gives you gross margin. Managers keep a close watch on the gross margin ratio,
which for Company A equals 35 percent ($70 gross margin per unit ÷ $200 sales price = 35%
gross margin ratio). Even a relatively small shift in this ratio can have huge impacts on profit.
Virtually all businesses have variable operating expenses, which are costs that move in
tandem with changes in sales revenue. One example of a variable expense is the commis-
sions paid to salespersons, which typically are a certain percent of sales revenue. Other
examples of variable expenses that fluctuate with sales are delivery expenses and bad debts
from credit sales. Total variable operating expenses equal variable operating expenses per
unit times sales volume. Deducting variable operating expenses from gross margin produces
contribution margin, or profit before fixed operating expenses are considered.
Businesses commit to a certain level of fixed operating expenses for the year. Examples of
fixed expenses are property taxes, employees on fixed salaries, insurance, depreciation, legal
and accounting, and so on. In the short run, fixed costs behave like the term implies —
they’re relatively fixed and constant in amount regardless of whether sales are high or low.
Fixed costs aren’t sensitive to fluctuations in sales over the short term. Company A’s
$3,000,000 fixed operating expenses for the period are divided by its 120,000 units sales
volume to determine the $25 fixed operating expenses per unit in Figure 10-1.
The final step in the walk down the profit ladder is deducting fixed operating expenses from
contribution margin. The remainder is the business’s operating profit for the year. The busi-
ness earned $1,800,000 operating profit for the year, which is 7.5 percent of its sales revenue
for the year. Internal operating profit (P&L) reports often include ratios (percents) for each
line item based on sales revenue, so managers can track changes in these important ratios
period to period.

Chapter 10: Analyzing Profit Behavior
Q.
Refer to the Company A example presented
in Figure 10-1. Purely hypothetically, sup-
pose the business could have sold either 5
percent more sales volume or it could have
sold the same sales volume at a 5 percent
higher sales price. Assume other profit fac-
tors remain the same. Which change — the
5 percent higher sales volume, or the 5 per-
cent higher sales price — would have been
better for operating profit?
A.
Well, 5 percent additional sales volume
means the business would have sold 6,000
more units than in the Figure 10-1 scenario:
(120,000 units sales volume in Figure 10-1 ×
5% = 6,000 additional units). Each addi-
tional unit sold would earn $40 contribu-
tion margin per unit (see Figure 10-1). So,
total contribution margin would have been
$240,000 higher. The business’s fixed oper-
ating expenses would not have increased
with such a relatively small increase in
sales volume. Therefore, its operating
profit would have been $240,000 higher.
Would the sales price increase have been
any better? You bet it would!
A 5 percent jump means sales price would
have been $10 per unit higher: ($200 sales
price in Figure 10-1 × 5% = $10 increase in
sales price). This would have increased the
contribution margin per unit from $40 (see
Figure 10-1) to $50. Therefore, the busi-
ness’s total contribution margin would
have been $6,000,000: ($50 contribution
per unit × 120,000 units sales volume =
$6,000,000 contribution margin). This
would be an increase of $1,200,000 over the
contribution margin in the Figure 10-1 sce-
nario. There’s no reason to think that fixed
operating expenses would be any different
at the higher sales price, so operating
profit would have increased $1,200,000.
In short, the 5 percent gain in sales price
would have been much better for operating
profit, compared with the 5 percent step up
in sales volume.

Analyzing Operating Profit
When handed an internal operating profit report like the one presented in Figure 10-1,
a business manager may say “thanks for the information” and leave it at that. An inter-
nal profit report like the one in Figure 10-1 is prepared according to the standard
accounting approach, which reports totals for sales revenue and expenses for the
period and which starts with sales revenue and works its way down to bottom line
profit (operating profit in the Figure 10-1 example). There’s nothing wrong with this
sort of report. Indeed, managers would be surprised not to get such profit reports on a
regular basis.
However, the layout of the typical accounting internal profit report is cumbersome for
analyzing profit behavior. As you know, business managers are busy people. They
don’t have a lot of time to wade through an accounting profit report to analyze the
impact of a change in sales volume, or a change in sales price, or a change in any of
the key factors that drive profit. An accounting profit report is not the best format for
the efficient analysis of profit behavior.
Busy business managers can analyze the profit performance of their business more
efficiently using compact profit models based on the five fundamental profit drivers.
There are different analysis methods, each having certain advantages. Managers are
best advised to be familiar with three profit analysis methods:
 Contribution margin minus fixed costs method
 Excess over breakeven method
 Minimizing fixed costs per unit method
Analysis method #1: Contribution 
margin minus fixed costs
The basis of this method is that fixed costs have a first claim on contribution margin,
and what’s left over is operating profit. This method starts with contribution margin per
unit, which is the catalyst of profit. To make profit, the business has to have an ade-
quate margin per unit. The second step of this method is to multiply contribution
margin per unit by sales volume. Earning a margin on each unit sold doesn’t help much
if a business doesn’t sell many units. (Which reminds me of the old joke, “A business
loses a little on each sale, but makes it up on volume.”)
Using this method Company A’s profit for the year is analyzed as follows:
Analysis method #1: Contribution margin minus fixed costs (see Figure 10-1 for data)
Contribution margin per unit
$40
Times annual sales volume, in units
   120,000
Equals total contribution margin

Less fixed operating expenses
    3,000,000
Equals operating profit
$1,8000,000
206
Part III: Managerial, Manufacturing, and Capital Accounting 

Analysis method #2: Excess over breakeven
The thinking behind this method is that a business has to first recover its fixed costs
by selling enough units before it starts making profit.
This profit analysis technique pivots on the breakeven volume of the business, which
you calculate as follows for Company A (see Figure 10-1 for data):
$3,000,000 annual fixed operating expenses ÷ $40 contribution margin per unit =
75,000 units breakeven point (volume)
Every additional unit sold over the breakeven volume brings in marginal profit (also
referred to as incremental profit.) The underlying theme of this method is that after you
sell enough units to recoup your fixed operating expenses for the year, you’re “home
free” as it were. (Of course, you can’t forget about interest expense and income tax.)
Using this method Company A’s profit for the year is analyzed as follows:
Analysis method #2: Excess over breakeven (see Figure 10-1 for data)
Annual sales volume for year, in units
120,000
Less annual breakeven volume, in units
  75,000
Equals excess over breakeven, in units
45,000
Times contribution margin per unit
            $40
Equals operating profit
$1,800,000
Analysis method #3: Minimizing 
fixed costs per unit
The thinking behind this method of analyzing profit is that a business has to spread its
fixed costs over enough sales volume to drive the average fixed cost per unit below its
contribution per unit. In this way, the business makes operating profit.
In this method of profit analysis, you compare the contribution margin per unit with
fixed operating expenses per unit, which you calculate by dividing annual fixed operat-
ing expenses by the number of units sold. For Company A, its average fixed operating
expenses per unit are
$3,000,000 annual fixed operating expenses ÷ 120,000 units sold = $25 fixed operat-
ing expenses per unit sold
The spread between the contribution margin per unit and the average fixed costs per
unit gives the profit per unit, which is scaled up by sales volume as follows:
Analysis method #3: Minimizing fixed costs per unit (see Figure 10-1 for data)
Contribution margin per unit

Less average fixed operating expenses per unit

One of Company A’s marketing managers was overheard to comment, “If we had sold 10 percent
more units than we did in the year, our profit would have been 10 percent higher.” Do you agree

Analyzing Return on Capital
Evaluating the financial performance of a business includes looking at how its profit stacks
up against the capital used by the business. Figure 10-1 presents Company A’s profit perform-
ance for the year down to the operating profit before interest and income tax. Did the busi-
ness earn enough operating profit relative to the capital it used to make this profit? 
Suppose, purely hypothetically, that Company A used $100,000,000 capital to earn its
$1,800,000 operating profit. In this situation, the business would have earned a measly 1.8
percent rate of return on the capital used to generate the profit:
$1,800,000 operating profit ÷ $100,000,000 capital = 1.8 percent rate of return
By almost any standard, 1.8 percent is a dismal return on capital performance.
In general terms, the amount of capital a business uses equals its total assets minus its oper-
ating liabilities that don’t charge interest. The main examples of non–interest bearing operat-
ing liabilities are accounts payable from purchases on credit and accrued expenses payable.
(I discuss these two liabilities in Chapters 6 and 7.) Operating liabilities typically account for
20 percent or more or a business’s total assets. The remainder of its assets (total assets less
total operating liabilities) is the amount of capital the business has to raise from two basic
sources: borrowing money on the basis of interest-bearing debt instruments, and raising equity
(ownership) capital from private or public sources.
Assume the following:
Company A’s Sources of Capital:
Debt
$4,000,000
Owners’ equity              $8,000,000
Total capital

lyze the profit performance of Company C. (You may note that both businesses in Figure 10-2
earned exactly the same amount of operating profit as the Company A business example for which
I explain three profit analysis methods in this section. This similarity allows you to compare the
key differences between businesses that earn the same profit.)
Solve It

The excess of operating profit earned on debt capital over the amount of interest is called
financial leverage gain. Company A made $360,000 financial leverage gain for the year
($600,000 operating profit earned on debt capital – $240,000 interest paid on debt = $360,000
financial leverage gain).
The owners supply 2⁄3 of the total capital of the business, so their share of the $1,800,000
operating profit earned by the business equals $1,200,000 ($1,800,000 operating profit × 2⁄3 =
$1,200,000 share of operating profit). In addition, the owners pick up the $360,000 financial
leverage gain. Therefore, the profit before income tax for owners equals $1,560,000 ($1,200,000
owners’ share of operating profit + $360,000 financial leverage gain = $1,560,000 profit before
income tax). The $1,560,000 profit before income tax yields the 19.5 percent on equity that
triggered this question.
Financial leverage is a double-edged sword. Suppose, for example, that in the example sce-
nario, Company A earned only $240,000 operating profit for the year. Interest is a contractual
obligation that can’t be avoided. In this situation, all Company A’s operating profit would go
to its debt holders, and profit after interest (before income tax) for its owners would be zero.
The business would have had a financial leverage loss that wiped out profit for its owners.
When a business suffers an operating loss, the burden of interest expense compounds the
felony and makes matters just that much worse for shareowners.
211
Chapter 10: Analyzing Profit Behavior
Q.
Company A earned 15.0 percent return on
capital (see the preceding calculation), but
its return on equity is 19.5 percent, which
is quite a bit higher. How do you explain
the difference?
A.
The higher rate of return on equity is due
to a financial leverage gain for the year.
Debt supplies 1⁄3 of the company’s capital
($4,000,000 ÷ $12,000,000 total capital = 1⁄3).
The business earned 15 percent return on
its debt capital ($4,000,000 debt × 15 per-
cent rate of return = $600,000 return on
debt capital). Because interest is a contrac-
tually fixed amount per period, the busi-
ness had to pay only $240,000 interest for
the use of its debt capital.
Company A’s return on capital for the year is:
$1,800,000 operating margin ÷ $12,000,000 capital = 15.0 percent return on capital
Company A’s interest expense for the year on its debt is $240,000. Deducting interest from
the $1,800,000 operating profit earned by the business gives $1,560,000 profit before income
tax. The rate of return on equity (before income tax) for the business is calculated as follows:
$1,560,000 profit before income tax ÷ $8,000,000 owners’ equity = 19.5 percent return 
on equity

Improving Profit Performance
Business managers are always looking for ways to improve profit performance (or they
should be). One obvious way to improve profit is to sell more units — to move more units
out the door without reducing sales prices. A business may have to increase its market share
to sell more volume, which is no easy task as I’m sure you know. Or perhaps the business is
in a growing market and doesn’t have to increase its market share. In any case, the logical
place to begin profit improvement analysis is an increase in sales volume.
Selling more units
Every business would like to have sold more units than they did during the most recent
period. Take the publisher of this book for example, Wiley Publishing, Inc. I’m certain that
the company would like to have sold more copies of Dummies books than the actual number
sold during the past year. All businesses are on the lookout for how to increase sales volume.
A fundamental growth strategy is to increase sales volume.
213
Chapter 10: Analyzing Profit Behavior
Q.
According to Figure 10-1, Company A sold
120,000 units during the year. If the busi-
ness had sold 5 percent more units, would
its profit have been 5 percent higher? You
might quickly review the answer to the
example question in the section “Mapping
Profit For Managers,” which I extend in the
following answer. 
A.
Before I can answer this question, I need to
address an important point: When you
start simulating increases in sales volume,
you have to make assumptions every step
of the way. In this case, the question asks
you to simulate a 5 percent (6,000 addi-
tional units) increase in sales volume to
see what happens in the profit example
(shown in Figure 10-1). In order to answer
the question, you have to assume
• That the sale price (average sales rev-
enue per unit) stays the same at $200
per unit
• That the product cost per unit remains
the same at $130 per unit
• That variable operating expenses hold
the same at 15 percent of sales revenue
• That Company A’s fixed operating
expenses stay the same at $3,000,000 for
the year
The last assumption is an important one to understand because it means that the business
has enough unused, or untapped, capacity to sell an additional 6,000 units of product. In
other words, you’re assuming that there was some slack in the organization such that it
could have sold 6,000 more units without stepping up its fixed costs to support the higher
sales volume. For relatively small changes in sales volume, that circumstance is probably
true in most situations. But on the other hand, what if the question had asked you to simu-
late an increase in sales volume of 30, 40, or 50 percent? With a change of this extent, a busi-
ness probably would have to hire more people, buy more delivery trucks, buy or rent more
warehouse space, and so on — with the result that its fixed operating expenses would be
higher at the higher sales volume level.
Capacity is a broad concept that refers to the capability of a business to handle sales activ-
ity. It encompasses all the resources needed to make sales, including employees, machines,
manufacturing and warehouse space, retail space, and so on. Many of the costs of capacity
are fixed in nature.

units during the year than it did according
to Figure 10-2. Determine Company B’s
operating profit for this scenario. (Assume
fixed operating expenses remain the same

10. Suppose Company B sold 5 percent fewer
units during the year than it did according
to Figure 10-2). Determine Company B’s
operating profit for this scenario. (Assume
fixed operating expenses remain the same
at the lower sales volume.)
Solve It
Keeping in mind the assumptions listed, operating profit would have increased much more
than 5 percent if Company A had sold 5 percent more units during the year. The key point is
this: Contribution margin would stay the same at $40 per unit because sales price, product
cost, and variable operating expenses per unit all remain the same (see Figure 10-1). So the
additional 6,000 units would have generated $240,000 additional contribution margin:
$40 contribution margin per unit × 6,000 units sales volume increase = $240,000 
contribution margin increase
Assuming that fixed operating expenses remain the same at the higher sales volume, operat-
ing profit increases $240,000 from a 5 percent increase in sales volume. This is an increase of
over 13 percent:
$240,000 operating profit increase × $1,800,000 operating profit = 13.3 percent increase
in contribution margin
In the end, a sales volume increase of only 5 percent would increase operating profit over 
13 percent! How do you like that?
In the example scenario, the bigger 13.3 percent swing in profit compared with the 5 percent
change in sales volume is referred to as operating leverage. At the higher sales volume, the
business gets more leverage, or better utilization, from its fixed operating expenses. At a
lower sales volume, the percent drop in profit would be more severe than the percent drop in
sales volume. In other words, the magnifying effect of operating leverage works both ways.

Improving margin per unit
Another way to improve operating profit is to increase the contribution margin per unit, with-
out increasing sales volume. Actually improving contribution margin per unit is very difficult
in the real world of business. To increase contribution margin per unit you have to increase
sales price, decrease product cost, decrease variable operating expenses per unit, or some
combination of these. None of these profit factors are easy to improve in the real world of
business, that’s for sure.
Q.
Suppose Company A (see Figure 10-1)
wants to improve its contribution margin
per unit as the means to order to increase
its operating profit $240,000. Assume its
120,000 units sales volume remains the
same. Assume, further, that the business
targeted its product cost as the most feasi-
ble way to improve contribution margin
per unit. So, assume that sales price, vari-
able operating expenses per unit, and fixed
operating expenses remain the same. How
much would product cost have to improve
to achieve the $240,000 increase in operat-
ing profit?
A.
The needed improvement in contribution
margin per unit is calculated as follows:
$240,000 desired increase in operating
profit ÷ 120,000 units sales volume = 
$2 improvement needed in contribution
margin per unit
Therefore, the business would have to reduce its product cost (cost of goods sold per unit) by
$2, from $130 to $128 per unit. Now, this may not sound like such a difficult task. However, the
business may  have already cut its product cost to the bone. Trying to squeeze another $2
reduction out of product cost may not be realistic. If the business cannot reduce product cost
$2 per unit, it has to look at sales price or variable operating expenses per unit in order to
improve contribution margin. Raising sales price $2 per unit, or lowering variable operating
expenses $2 per unit may be no easier than reducing product cost $2 per unit. 

216
Part III: Managerial, Manufacturing, and Capital Accounting 
In the preceding example I focus on lowering product cost as one basic way to improve con-
tribution margin per unit. Another basic strategy for improving contribution margin per unit
is to increase sales price. Sales prices are the province of marketing managers. I’d be the first
to admit that I am not a marketing expert. Setting sales prices is a complex decision involving
consumer psychology and many other factors. Nevertheless, in discussing the general topic
of how to improve contribution margin per unit I should say a few words about raising sales
price — mainly to show the powerful impact of a higher sales price.
13. Suppose that Company B was able to improve (lower) its product cost per unit $10. Assume that
all other profit factors for Company B remain the same as shown in Figure 10-2. Determine its
operating profit for this scenario. Also, how does this change affect the company’s breakeven
sales volume?

14. Suppose that Company C’s product cost increases $0.50 per unit. Assume that all other profit fac-
tors for Company C remain the same as shown in Figure 10-2. Determine its operating profit for
this scenario. Also, how does this change affect the company’s breakeven sales volume?

15. Suppose that Company B had to drop its
sales price $10 due to competitive pres-
sures. All other profit factors remain the
same as shown in Figure 10-2. The com-
pany’s volume-driven variable expenses
are $15 per unit sold, and its revenue-
driven variable operating expenses are 20
percent of sales revenue. Determine
Company B’s operating profit for this sce-
nario. Also, how does this change affect the
company’s breakeven sales volume?

16. Suppose that Company C increased its sales
price $1.50. Sales volume remains the same
as shown in Figure 10-2. The company’s 
revenue-driven variable operating expenses
are 10 percent of sales revenue, and its
volume-driven variable operating expenses
are $0.40 per unit sold. Determine Company
C’s operating profit for this scenario. Also,
how does this change affect the company’s
breakeven sales volume?
Solve It
Q.
Suppose that Company B (see Figure 10-2
for its profit data) could increase its sales
price $15 per unit and sell the same
number of units. Assume Company B’s
volume-driven variable operating expenses
are $15 per unit sold, and its revenue-
driven variable operating expenses are 20
percent of sales revenue. How would this
$15 sales price increase affect its contribu-
tion margin per unit, total contribution
margin, and operating profit?
A.
If the business raises sales price $15, its
volume-driven expenses per unit remain
the same, but its revenue-driven expenses
increase $3 per unit, which is 20 percent of
the $15 sales price increase. So, the net
gain in contribution margin per unit is only
$12. Therefore,
$12 net increase in contribution margin
per unit × 50,000 units sales volume =
$600,000 contribution margin increase
Company B’s fixed operating expenses
should remain the same (a sales price
increase should have no bearing on a busi-
ness’s fixed operating expenses). Therefore,
the increase in contribution margin would
increase the business’s operating profit
$600,000.
You don’t get too far in discussing raising sales price without bumping into a problem con-
cerning variable operating expenses per unit. Most businesses have two types of variable
operating expenses. Some vary with sales volume (the number of units sold) and some vary
with sales revenue (the number of dollars from sales). For example, sales commissions
depend on the dollar amount of sales. In contrast, packing and shipping costs depend on the
number of units sold and delivered.

Making Trade-Offs Among Profit Factors
I used to regularly ask my students whether, as future business managers, they would drop
sales prices 10 percent in order to increase sales volume 10 percent. Invariably, they would
answer, “It depends.” Invariably, I would respond, “No, it doesn’t.” The answer is clear.
Unless you’re willing to do anything to increase your market share, trading a 10 percent
decrease in sales prices for a 10 percent increase in sales volume is dumb . . . and I mean
really dumb.
218
Part III: Managerial, Manufacturing, and Capital Accounting 
Q.
Company B (see Figure 10-2) decides to analyze the impact that dropping its sales price 10 per-
cent to gain a 10 percent increase in sales volume would have on its operating profit. What would
Company B’s operating profit be in this scenario?
A.
The following comparative schedule shows just how devastating this trade-off would be on the
company’s operating profit.

This comparative schedule shows that operating profit would decrease $945,000, which is a
decrease of more than 50 percent of the amount before the trade-off. See why this trade-off
is a bad idea? The only argument I got from my students, especially the marketing majors,
was that a business may take such an action to gain market share. But that’s another argu-
ment. The accountant’s job is to calculate the precipitous drop-off in operating profit in this
situation.
The reason for the huge drop-off in operating profit is simple enough (although perhaps not
immediately obvious). The 10 percent decrease in sales price causes contribution margin
per unit to drop from $75 to $51 (see the preceding comparative schedule), which is a
plunge of 32 percent in Company B’s contribution margin per unit ($24 decrease ÷ $75 con-
tribution margin per unit before sales price decrease = 32 percent decrease). A paltry 10
percent increase in sales volume can’t make up for such a large drop in contribution margin
per unit.

219
Chapter 10: Analyzing Profit Behavior
17. Suppose that Company A (see Figure 10-1)
were to offer all customers special rebates
as a sales incentive. As a result, assume
that sales price would decrease $10 per
unit, but that annual sales volume would
increase to 150,000 units. Assume that the
company’s fixed operating expenses would
not increase at the higher sales volume
level (which may be stretching things a
bit). Also assume that its variable operat-
ing expenses are all revenue-driven and
equal to 15 percent of sales revenue. In
terms of the impact on operating profit,
would the rebate strategy to increase 
sales volume be a good trade-off for the
company?

18. The example question in this section
shows a scenario for Company B that
involves a 10 percent reduction in sales
price with a 10 percent increase in sales
volume. According to the comparative
schedule, it’s clear that a 10 percent sales
volume increase isn’t nearly enough.
Determine the sales volume level needed 
at the lower sales price to keep operating
profit the same at $1,800,000.

Answers to Problems on Analyzing 
Profit Behavior
The following are the answers to the practice questions presented earlier in this chapter.
a
One of Company A’s marketing managers was overheard to comment, “If we had sold 10 percent
more units than we did in the year, our profit would have been 10 percent higher.” Do you agree
with this comment? (Figure 10-1 presents Company A’s operating profit report for the year.)
Increasing sales volume 10 percent would have increased total contribution margin 10 percent,
assuming that sales price, product cost, and variable operating expenses remained the same.
So far the this answer is relatively straightforward. The next step concerns what would happen
to the company’s total fixed operating expenses at the higher sales volume level.
Fixed operating costs don’t increase with an increase in sales volume unless the increase in
sales volume is relatively large such that the business would have to expand its capacity to
accommodate the higher sales volume. Generally speaking, a business probably can take on a
10 percent sales volume increase without having to increase its capacity, at least in the short
run. (Remember, an increase in capacity requires an increase in fixed operating expenses.)
Assuming the company’s total fixed operating expenses would have been the same, all of the
increase in total contribution margin would “fall down” to operating profit. Operating profit,
therefore, would have increased more than 10 percent. The increase in total contribution
margin is more than 10 percent of operating profit because operating profit is a smaller amount
than the total contribution margin amount.

Instead of the scenario shown in Figure 10-1 assume that Company A had a bad year. The inter-
nal operating profit report for this alternative scenario is presented below. Using the three
methods explained in this section, analyze why the business suffered a loss for the year.

Assume the following:
Company B’s Sources of Capital:
See Figure 10-2 for Company B’s operating profit data for the year. The business recorded
$480,000 interest for the year. Calculate its financial leverage gain (or loss) for the year.
In this case, debt holders provide two-thirds of the company’s total capital ($8 million of the
total $12 million capital). Thus, two-thirds of its $1,800,000 operating profit can be attributed 
to the debt capital used by the business, which equals $1,200,000 (2⁄3 × $1,800,000 = $1,200,000).
The company paid only $480,000 interest on its debt capital. So:
$1,200,000 operating profit attributable to debt capital – $480,000 interest on debt capital =
$720,000 financial leverage gain
Here’s another way to calculate financial leverage gain: The company earned 15 percent return
on capital ($1,800,000 operating profit ÷ $12,000,000 total capital = 15.0 percent return on 
capital). The company paid a 6 percent interest rate on its debt capital ($480,000 interest ÷
$8,000,000 debt = 6 percent interest rate). There’s a favorable 9 percent spread between the 
two rates. Therefore:
9 percent favorable spread between return on capital and interest rate × $8,000,000 debt =
$720,000 financial leverage gain.
f
Assume the following:
Company C’s Sources of Capital:
See Figure 10-2 for Company C’s profit data for the year. The business recorded $360,000 inter-
est for the year. Calculate its financial leverage gain (or loss) for the year.

Owners’ equity
$4,000,000
Total capital

222
Part III: Managerial, Manufacturing, and Capital Accounting 

In this case, debt holders provide one-half of the company’s total capital ($6 million of the total
$12 million capital). Thus, one-half of its $1,800,000 operating profit can be attributed to the
debt capital used by the business, which equals $900,000 (1⁄2 × $1,800,000 = $900,000).
The company paid only $360,000 interest on its debt capital. So:
$900,000 operating profit attributable to debt capital – $360,000 interest on debt capital =
$540,000 financial leverage gain
g
Suppose that Company B’s fixed operating expenses were $3,030,000 for the year. Otherwise,
other profit factors are the same as in Figure 10-2. Using the sources of capital and interest
expense presented in Question 5, calculate Company B’s financial leverage gain (or loss) for 
the year.
For the year, Company B earned $3,750,000 total contribution margin (see Figure 10-2). If its fixed
operating expenses were $3,030,000, its operating profit for the year would be only $720,000.
Based on this operating profit, Company B’s return on capital would be only 6 percent ($720,000 ÷
$12,000,000 total capital = 6 percent return on capital).
In this case, debt supplies two-thirds of total capital. Therefore, two-thirds of its $720,000 oper-
ating profit can be attributed to its debt capital, which is $480,000 ($720,000 operating profit × 2⁄3
= $480,000). The company paid $480,000 interest in the year. Thus, its financial leverage gain is
zero.
Here’s another way to calculate the company’s financial leverage gain/loss for the year: The
business earned only 6 percent return on capital, and its interest rate on debt is 6 percent
($480,000 interest ÷ $8,000,000 debt = 6 percent). So, there’s no spread, or difference, between
its 6 percent return on capital and its interest rate. Therefore, there’s no financial leverage gain
(or loss).
h
Suppose that Company C’s fixed operating expenses were $4,440,000 for the year. Otherwise,
other profit factors are the same as in Figure 10-2. Using the sources of capital and interest
expense presented in Question 6, calculate Company C’s financial leverage gain (or loss) for 
the year.
For the year, Company C earned $4,800,000 total contribution margin (see Figure 10-2). If its fixed
operating expenses were $4,440,000, its operating profit for the year would be only $360,000.
Based on this operating profit, the company’s return on capital would be a very low 3 percent
($360,000 ÷ $12,000,000 total capital = 3 percent return on capital)
In this case, debt supplies one half of total capital. Therefore, one half of its $360,000 operating
profit can be attributed to its debt capital, which is $180,000 ($360,000 operating profit × 1⁄2 =
$180,000). The company paid $360,000 interest in the year. Thus, it has a financial leverage loss
equal to $180,000.
Here’s another way to calculate the company’s financial leverage loss for the year: The business
earned only 3 percent return on capital, and its interest rate on debt is 6 percent ($360,000 inter-
est ÷ $6,000,000 debt = 6.0 percent). So, there’s an unfavorable 3 percent spread between return
on capital and interest rate. The company’s financial leverage loss for the year is $180,000 (3 per-
cent unfavorable spread × $6,000,000 debt = $180,000 financial leverage loss for the year).
i
Suppose Company B sold 10 percent more units during the year than it did according to Fig-
ure 10-2. Determine Company B’s operating profit for this scenario. (Assume fixed operating
expenses remain the same at the higher sales volume.)
For Company B, selling 10 percent additional units equals 5,000 additional units sold. Given that
its contribution margin per unit is $75, the increase in its total contribution margin is:
5,000 additional units × $75 contribution margin per unit = $375,000 increase in total 
contribution margin
223
Chapter 10: Analyzing Profit Behavior

Because fixed operating expenses don’t increase at the higher sales volume level, the gain in
total contribution margin increases operating profit $375,000. The 10 percent increase in sales
volume increases operating profit 20.8 percent ($375,000 gain in operating profit ÷ $1,800,000
operating profit at the original sales volume level = 20.8 percent increase).
The percent gain in operating profit is much larger than the percent increase in sales volume.
This magnification effect is called operating leverage.
j
Suppose Company B sold 5 percent fewer units during the year than it did according to Fig-
ure 10-2. Determine Company B’s operating profit for this scenario. (Assume fixed operating
expenses remain the same at the lower sales volume.)
For Company B, selling 5 percent less units equals 2,500 fewer units sold. Given that its contri-
bution margin per unit is $75, the decrease in its total contribution margin is:
2,500 fewer units × $75 contribution margin per unit = $187,500 decrease in total contribution
margin
Because fixed operating expenses don’t decrease at the lower sales volume level, the drop in
total contribution margin decreases operating profit $187,500. The 5 percent decrease in sales
volume decreases operating profit 10.4 percent ($187,500 fall in operating profit ÷ $1,800,000
operating profit at the original sales volume level = 10.4 percent decrease).
The percent drop in operating profit is much larger than the percent decrease in sales volume.
This magnification effect is called operating leverage.
k
Suppose Company C sold 5 percent more units during the year than it did according to Figure
10-2. Determine Company C’s operating profit for this scenario. (Assume fixed operating
expenses remain the same at the higher sales volume.)
For Company C, selling 5 percent additional units equals 75,000 additional units sold. Given that
its contribution margin per unit is $3.20, the increase in its total contribution margin is:
75,000 additional units × $3.20 contribution margin per unit = $240,000 increase in total 
contribution margin
Because fixed operating expenses don’t increase at the higher sales volume level, the gain in
total contribution margin increases operating profit $240,000. The 5 percent increase in sales
volume increases operating profit 13.3 percent ($240,000 gain in operating profit ÷ $1,800,000
operating profit at the original sales volume level = 13.3 percent increase).
l
Suppose Company C sold 10 percent fewer units during the year than it did according to Figure
10-2. Determine Company C’s operating profit for this scenario. (Assume fixed operating
expenses remain the same at the lower sales volume.)
For Company C, selling 10 percent less units equals 150,000 fewer units sold. Given that its con-
tribution margin per unit is $3.20, the decrease in its total contribution margin is:
150,000 fewer units × $3.20 contribution margin per unit = $480,000 decrease in total 
contribution margin
Because fixed operating expenses don’t decrease at the lower sales volume level, the drop in
total contribution margin decreases operating profit $480,000. The 10 percent decrease in sales
volume decreases operating profit 26.7 percent ($480,000 fall in operating profit ÷ $1,800,000
operating profit at the original sales volume level = 26.7 percent decrease).
m
Suppose that Company B was able to improve (lower) its product cost per unit $10. Assume
that all other profit factors for Company B remain the same as shown in Figure 10-2. Determine
its operating profit for this scenario. Also, how does this change affect the company’s
breakeven sales volume?
224
Part III: Managerial, Manufacturing, and Capital Accounting 

The complete schedule of changes in this scenario is as follows:
As the schedule shows, operating profit increases $500,000, which is a 27.8 percent increase
from a 6.7 percent change in product cost ($10 decrease ÷ $150 = 6.7 percent decrease).
The company’s breakeven decreases because contribution margin per unit is higher than it was
before the product cost change:
$1,950,000 fixed operating expenses ÷ $85 contribution margin per unit = 22,941 units
breakeven volume
At the $75 contribution margin per unit, Company B’s breakeven volume is 26,000 units sales
volume.
n
Suppose that Company C’s product cost increases $0.50 per unit. Assume that all other profit
factors for Company C remain the same as shown in Figure 10-2. Determine its operating profit
for this scenario. Also, how does this change affect the company’s breakeven sales volume?
The impact on contribution margin and operating profit from the seemingly small increase in
product cost is shown in the following comparative schedule:
So, operating profit drops $750,000, from $1,800,000 to only $1,050,000, which is a 41.7 percent
decrease! The reason is the relatively large drop in contribution margin per unit, from $3.20 to
only $2.70, which is a 15.6 percent decline. The importance of maintaining the contribution
margin per unit cannot be overstated.
If Company C’s product cost increases $0.50 per unit, the company’s breakeven also increases
because contribution margin per unit is lower than it was before the product cost change:
$3,000,000 fixed operating expenses ÷ $2.70 contribution margin per unit = 1,111,111 units
breakeven volume
At the $3.20 contribution margin per unit, the breakeven volume is 937,500 units sales 
volume.

profit factors remain the same as shown in Figure 10-2. The company’s volume-driven variable
expenses are $15 per unit sold, and its revenue-driven variable operating expenses are 20 per-
cent of sales revenue. Determine Company B’s operating profit for this scenario. Also, how does
this change affect the company’s breakeven sales volume?
The circumstances cause the company’s operating profit to decrease $400,000, as shown in the
following schedule:
If Company B’s sales price drops $10, the company’s breakeven increases because contribution
margin per unit is lower than it was before the sales price change:
$1,950,000 fixed operating expenses ÷ $67 contribution margin per unit = 29,104 units
breakeven volume
At the $75 contribution margin per unit, the breakeven volume is 26,000 units sales volume.
p
Suppose that Company C increased its sales price $1.50. Sales volume remains the same as
shown in Figure 10-2. The company’s revenue-driven variable operating expenses are 10 per-
cent of sales revenue, and its volume-driven variable operating expenses are $0.40 per unit
sold. Determine Company C’s operating profit for this scenario. Also, how does this change
affect the company’s breakeven sales volume?
The circumstances cause the company’s operating profit to increase $2,025,000, as shown in
the following schedule:
If Company C’s sales price increases $1.50, the company’s breakeven decreases because contri-
bution margin per unit is higher than it was before the sales price change:
$3,000,000 fixed operating expenses ÷ $4.55 contribution margin per unit = 659,341 units
breakeven volume
At the $3.20 contribution margin per unit, the breakeven volume is 937,500 units sales volume.

Suppose that Company A (see Figure 10-1) were to offer all customers special rebates as a sales
incentive. As a result, assume that sales price would decrease $10 per unit, but that annual
sales volume would increase to 150,000 units. Assume that the company’s fixed operating
expenses would not increase at the higher sales volume level (which may be stretching things a
bit). Also assume that its variable operating expenses are all revenue-driven and equal to 15
percent of sales revenue. In terms of the impact on operating profit, would the rebate strategy
to increase sales volume a good trade-off for the company?
On the surface, this trade-off appears to be a good one that improves operating profit. After all,
the company decreases sales price only 5 percent for a 25 percent jump in sales volume. Surely
this must be a good deal. But look closely at the following comparative schedule:
As the schedule shows, operating profit actually decreases $75,000 in this scenario. One key 
to understanding this change is that the contribution margin per unit decreases 21.25 percent
($8.50 decrease ÷ $40.00 contribution margin per unit before sales price decrease = 21.25 per-
cent). The 25 percent increase in sales volume (from 120,000 units to 150,000 units) isn’t
enough to make up for the drop in the all important contribution margin per unit.
r
The example question in this section shows a scenario for Company B that involves a 10 per-
cent reduction in sales price with a 10 percent increase in sales volume. According to the com-
parative schedule, it’s clear that a 10 percent sales volume increase isn’t nearly enough.
Determine the sales volume level needed at the lower sales price to keep operating profit the
same at $1,800,000.
Obviously, sales volume has to increase more than 10 percent to keep operating profit at
$1,800,000. The following calculation determines the exact sales volume needed to keep 
operating profit the same:
$3,750,000 contribution margin target ÷ $51 contribution margin after sales price decrease =
73,529 units sales volume needed to keep operating profit the same
This answer is proven in the following comparative schedule using the 73,529 units sales

Manufacturing Cost Accounting
In This Chapter
 Recognizing the different types of manufacturing costs
 Getting to know manufacturing journal entries
 Calculating product cost
I
n addition to normal accounting matters, businesses that manufacture products face addi-
tional accounting problems that retailers and distributors do not. Throughout this chapter,
I use the term manufacture in the broadest sense: Automobile makers assemble cars, beer
companies brew beer, automobile gasoline companies refine oil, DuPont makes products
through chemical synthesis, and so on. Retailers (also called merchandisers) and distributors,
on the other hand, buy products in a condition ready for resale to the end consumer. For
example, Wal-Mart and Target don’t manufacture the products they sell. Other companies
manufacture the products that retailers sell — although the manufacturers may put private
labels on the goods (which is common practice for grocery stores and other retailers).
The chapter focuses mainly on the accounting procedures used to accumulate the basic
types of manufacturing costs and how these pools of costs are used to determine product
cost. A manufacturer must know product cost in order to determine its cost of goods sold
expense for the period and the cost of its inventory. The chapter explores certain unavoid-
able problems accountants face in determining product cost. To complete the picture, the
chapter also explains how unscrupulous managers can set production output to manipulate
profit for the period.
Minding Manufacturing Costs
A manufacturing business, first of all, must separate between its manufacturing costs and
non-manufacturing costs. Manufacturing costs are the costs of production that are included
in the determination of product cost. Non-manufacturing costs include marketing expenses
and the general and administration expenses of the business, which are referred to as period
costs. I explain the importance of the distinction between product and period costs later in
the section. First, I explain the basic types of manufacturing costs that go into the calculation
of product cost.
Manufacturing costs consist of four basic types:
 Raw materials: What a manufacturer buys from other companies to use in the produc-
tion of its own products. For example, General Motors buys tires from Goodyear (or
other tire manufacturers) that become part of GM’s cars.
 Direct labor: Compensation of employees who work on the production line.
 Variable overhead: Indirect production costs that increase or decrease as the quantity
produced increases or decreases. An example is the cost of electricity that runs a com-
pany’s production machines: If the business increases or decreases the use of those
machines, the electricity cost increases or decreases accordingly.

 Fixed overhead: Indirect production costs that do not increase or decrease as the
quantity produced increases or decreases. These fixed costs remain the same over a
fairly broad range of production output levels. Fixed manufacturing costs include:
• Salaries for certain production employees who don’t work directly on the produc-
tion line, such as a vice president, safety inspectors, security guards, account-
ants, and shipping and receiving workers
• Depreciation of production buildings, equipment, and other manufacturing fixed
assets
• Occupancy costs, such as building insurance, property taxes, and heating and
lighting charges
Figure 11-1 presents an internal operating profit report of a manufacturer I call Company X;
the report includes information about the company’s manufacturing activity and costs for
the year. A business may manufacture hundreds or thousands of products, but in the exam-
ple, Company X manufactures and sells only one product. The example is realistic yet avoids
the clutter of too much detail. Figure 11-1 is a good platform to illustrate the fundamental
accounting problems and methods of all manufacturers.
The information in the operating profit report and manufacturing activity summary in Figure
11-1 is confidential and for management eyes only. The company’s competitors would love to
know this information. For instance, if Company X enjoys a significant product cost advan-
tage over its competitors, it definitely wouldn’t want its cost data to get into their hands.
Product costs
Unlike a retailer that purchases products in a condition ready for resale, a manufacturer
begins by purchasing the raw materials needed in the production process. Then the manu-
facturer pays workers to operate the production machines and equipment and to move the

products into warehouses after they’re produced. All this work is done in a sprawling plant
that has many indirect overhead costs. All these different production costs are funneled
into product cost.
When manufacturing costs are incurred, they’re recorded in an inventory account — in par-
ticular, the work-in-process inventory account. I explain the use of this account in the section
“Taking a Short Tour of Manufacturing Entries” later in this chapter. Product costs are later
recorded in the cost of goods sold expense when the products are sold.
Pay special attention to the $760.00 product cost and its components in Figure 11-1. In partic-
ular, note that the $760.00 is the sum of four separate cost components — raw materials,
direct labor, variable manufacturing overhead, and fixed manufacturing overhead. All four of
the component costs must be correct to end up with the correct product cost.
Product costs are said to be capitalized because they’re viewed as a capital investment, which
is an investment in an asset. Product costs aren’t recorded to expense until the products are
eventually sold, at which time the appropriate amount of cost is removed from the asset
account and recorded in the cost of goods sold expense account.
Period costs
Costs that are charged to expense when they’re recorded are known as period costs.
Marketing costs (such as advertising, sales personnel, or delivery of products to customers)
are period costs. These selling costs are recorded as expenses in the period the costs are
incurred. General and administrative costs (such as legal and accounting, compensation of
officers, or information and data processing) are also period costs. Period costs do not pass
through an inventory account.
Separating period and product costs
The distinction between period and product costs is very important. What if a business
deliberately recorded some of its manufacturing costs as period costs instead of as product
costs? Suppose that for the year just ended, a business recorded $2,400,000 of its manufac-
turing costs as marketing expenses. The $2,400,000 should have gone into inventory and
stayed there until the products were sold. To the extent the products haven’t yet been sold
at the end of the year, the business has understated the cost of its ending inventory and
overstated its marketing expense for the year. Why would a business do this? To minimize its
current year’s taxable income, that’s why.
Evidently many businesses were in the habit of misclassifying some costs as period costs
(immediate expense deduction) instead of product costs. In response the IRS has laid down
rules regarding what has to be treated as a manufacturing cost. Nevertheless, there are still
many gray areas in which drawing a line between manufacturing and non-manufacturing
costs is not entirely clear-cut. In any case, a business should be consistent from period to
period regarding how it classifies its manufacturing and non-manufacturing costs.
Wages paid to production line workers are a clear example of a manufacturing cost. Salaries
paid to salespeople are a marketing cost and are not part of product cost. Depreciation on
production equipment is a manufacturing cost, but depreciation on the warehouse in which
products are stored after being manufactured is a period cost. Similarly, moving raw materi-
als and partially completed goods through production process is a manufacturing cost, 
but transporting the finished products from the warehouse to customers is a period cost.
Essentially, product cost stops at the end of the production line — but every cost up to that
point is a manufacturing cost.
231
Chapter 11: Manufacturing Cost Accounting

The business uses the LIFO (last in, first out) method: All 110,000 units sold are charged 
out at the $760.00 product cost per unit, which is for the latest batch of units produced.
(The example treats the entire year as one production period for determining product 
cost, whereas in actual practice, product cost is determined monthly or quarterly.) In 
other words, none of the cost from its beginning inventory is charged to cost of goods sold
expense. The cost of beginning inventory most likely is carried on the books at a lower
product cost. If the company were to use the FIFO (first in, first out) method, some of the
units sold during the year would have been charged out based on the product cost in begin-
ning inventory. (I discuss the LIFO and FIFO methods in Chapter 9.)
232
Part III: Managerial, Manufacturing, and Capital Accounting 
1.
The company’s total manufacturing costs
for the year are $91,200,000 (see Figure
11-1), but only $83,600,000 is charged to
cost of goods expense. What happened to
the other $7,600,000 ($91,200,000 manufac-
turing costs for year – $83,600,000 cost of
goods sold expense for year = $7,600,000)?
Solve It
2.
As you can see in Figure 11-1, Company X
recorded $42,000,000 fixed manufacturing
overhead costs in the year. Suppose,
instead, that its fixed manufacturing over-
head costs were $45,600,000 for the year,
which is an increase of $3,600,000. Would
the company’s operating profit have been
$3,600,000 lower? (Assume that variable
manufacturing costs per unit and operating
expenses remain the same.)
Solve It
A manufacturer must design and implement a cost accounting system to determine the cost of
every product it manufactures and sells. The business must track the costs of all raw materi-
als that go into the production process and the costs of all production line labor (which may
involve hundreds or thousands of operations). Furthermore, the business has to determine
and allocate many indirect manufacturing costs to the various products it manufactures
(although in the example shown in Figure 11-1, the business produces only one product).
Tracking and allocating these costs is a very challenging task, to say the least.
Q.
How is the $83,600,000 cost of goods sold
expense of Company X determined (see
Figure 11-1)?
A.
In the example (see Figure 11-1), the busi-
ness recorded $91,200,000 total manufac-
turing costs to produce 120,000 units
during the year. Therefore, the product
cost per unit is $760.00: ($91,200,000 total
manufacturing costs ÷ 120,000 units pro-
duction output = $760.00 product cost per
unit). Based on this product cost per unit
its cost of goods sold expense for the year
is determined as follows:
$760.00 product cost × 110,000 units
sales volume = $83,600,000 cost of 
goods sold expense

233
Chapter 11: Manufacturing Cost Accounting
3.
Suppose that Company X uses the FIFO
method instead of the LIFO method shown
in Figure 11-1. The company starts the year
with 25,000 units in beginning inventory at
a cost of $735 per unit according to the
FIFO method. During the year, it manufac-
tures 120,000 units and sells 110,000 units
(see Figure 11-1). Determine Company X’s
cost of goods sold expense for the year and
its cost of ending inventory using the FIFO
method.
Solve It
4.
Company X produced 120,000 units and
sold 110,000 units during the year (see
Figure 11-1). Therefore, the company
increased its inventory 10,000 units. Does
this increase seem reasonable? Or is the
company’s production output compared
with its sales volume out of kilter?
Solve It
Taking a Short Tour of Manufacturing Entries
When a retailer or wholesaler purchases products, it debits (increases) an inventory account.
The cost of the products is held in an inventory account until the products are sold. At that
time, the appropriate amount of cost is removed from the inventory account and charged to
cost of goods sold expense. The amount of the cost removed from inventory is determined by
which cost of goods sold expense method is used, such as FIFO or LIFO. (I discuss cost of
goods sold expense methods in Chapter 9.)
In contrast to retailers and wholesalers, a manufacturer has to make more entries to get to
its cost of goods sold expense. The following illustrative entries are based on the Company X
manufacturing example, whose operating profit report and manufacturing activity summary
appear in Figure 11-1.
Company X purchased $27,325,000 of raw materials during the year, which is slightly more
than the cost of materials released into the manufacturing process. Therefore, its inventory
of raw materials increased during the year. The business has a good credit rating, and pur-
chased all its raw materials on credit: Its raw materials purchases during the year are shown
in the following entry:
Raw Materials Inventory
$27,325,000
Accounts Payable
$27,325,000

234
Part III: Managerial, Manufacturing, and Capital Accounting 
When raw materials are released from inventory storage into the manufacturing process, the
cost is charged to a particular job order or to a particular department. The transfers of raw
materials to production during the year are shown in the following entry:
Work-in-Process Inventory
$25,800,000
Raw Materials Inventory
$25,800,000
The work-in-process inventory account is a special account used by manufacturers to accumu-
late the costs of products working their way through the production process. These prod-
ucts aren’t ready for sale until the production process is completed. At that time, an entry 
is made to move the product cost out of this temporary holding account into the finished
goods inventory account — see the entry below (the second to last entry).
The company’s direct labor costs consist of all elements of compensation earned by its pro-
duction line workers. The largest part of the compensation of production line workers is paid
in cash, but payroll taxes are withheld and fringe benefit costs are also recorded in various
liability accounts. In the following entries I use Accrued payables as the generic title for vari-
ous liability accounts used to record costs incurred by the business that are paid at a later
time. The direct labor costs of the business during the period are shown in the following
entry:
Work-in-Process Inventory
$15,000,000
Cash
$xx,xxx,xxx
Payroll Taxes Payable
$x,xxx,xxx
Accrued Payables
$x,xxx,xxx
The bulk of the company’s variable manufacturing overhead costs are paid in cash over the
course of the year, but two liability accounts — accounts payable and accrued payables —
are involved in recording many of these costs. The business’s variable manufacturing over-
head costs for the year are shown in the following entry:
Work-in-Process Inventory
$8,400,000
Cash
$x,xxx,xxx
Accounts Payable
$xxx,xxx
Accrued Payables
$xxx,xxx
Most of the company’s indirect fixed manufacturing overhead costs for period are paid in
cash during the year, but many involve liability accounts for unpaid manufacturing costs —
such as the two shown in the following entry. Also, depreciation is a major fixed overhead
cost, so the accumulated depreciation account is credited in recording the depreciation cost
component of fixed manufacturing overhead costs. The business’s fixed manufacturing over-
head costs for the year are shown in the following entry:
Work-in-Process Inventory
$42,000,000
Cash
$xx,xxx,xxx
Accumulated Depreciation
$x,xxx,xxx
Accounts Payable
$x,xxx,xxx
Accrued Payables
$x,xxx,xxx

When the manufacturing process is completed products are moved off the production
line to the warehouse. The appropriate amount of product cost is removed from the
work-in-process inventory account and entered in the finished goods inventory
account. The transfers of products from the production line to the finished goods ware-
house during the year are shown in the following entry:
Finished Goods Inventory
$91,200,000
Work-in-Process Inventory
$91,200,000
Note: In these entries, I assume that there was no work-in-process at the beginning or
end of the year. This assumption would be accurate, for instance, if the business shut
down its manufacturing activity for a week or two at the end of the year to permit a
fumigation of the plant or to give workers a holiday vacation. The entries would be
more involved if there was work-in-process inventory at the start and end of the year.
Recording the cost of products sold during the year is shown in the following entry:
Cost of Goods Sold Expense
$83,600,000
Finished Goods Inventory
$83,600,000

Assume that Company Y uses the LIFO
method to charge out raw materials to pro-
duction. In this question, assume that
supply shortages of raw materials meant
that Company Y couldn’t purchase all the
raw materials it needed for production
during the year, and it had to draw down
its raw materials inventory. Fortunately, it
had an adequate beginning inventory of
raw materials to cover the gap in pur-
chases during the year. In this situation,
would the cost of raw materials issued to
production be different than the $7,500,000
shown in Figure 11-2?

Calculating Product Cost: Basic 
Methods and Problems
Product cost, $760.00 in the example shown in Figure 11-1, consists of two quite different
types of manufacturing costs: variable costs (including raw materials, direct labor, and vari-
able overhead) and fixed overhead costs. Variable manufacturing costs remain the same per
unit (except at very low or very high levels of production). Thus, the total of variable manufac-
turing costs moves up and down with increases and decreases in production output (the
number of units produced). In contrast, fixed costs are rigid; these costs remain the same and
unchanged over a broad range of production output levels. Many of these fixed costs would
have to be paid even if the business had to shut down its manufacturing for several months.
Refer to Figure 11-1 for Company X’s manufacturing cost information. Its $760.00 product
cost consists of $410.00 total variable costs per unit manufactured and $350.00 fixed manu-
facturing overhead cost per unit.
If Company X had manufactured ten more units than it did during the year, its total variable
manufacturing costs would have been $4,100 higher (10 additional units × $410 per unit =
$4,100). The actual number of units produced drives total variable manufacturing costs, so
even one more unit would have caused the variable costs to increase $410. But the com-
pany’s total fixed manufacturing overhead costs would have been the same if it had pro-
duced ten more units, or 10,000 more units for that matter. Variable manufacturing costs are
bought on a per unit basis, as it were, whereas fixed manufacturing costs are bought in bulk
at fixed prices for the whole period.
Total manufacturing costs for the year are calculated as follows:
(Variable manufacturing costs per unit × Number of units produced) + 
Fixed manufacturing overhead costs = Total manufacturing costs
Connecting fixed manufacturing overhead 
costs and production capacity
Fixed manufacturing overhead costs present certain problems in determining product cost
and operating profit (that is, profit before interest and income tax expenses).
Why in the world would a manufacturer in its right mind commit to fixed manufacturing 
overhead costs? For example, according to Figure 11-1, Company X has $42,000,000 of these
cost commitments hanging over its head for the year whether it produces 15,000 or 150,000
units or any number in between. The answer is that fixed manufacturing costs are needed 
to provide production capacity — the people and physical resources needed to manufacture
products — for the year. When the business has the production plant and people in place for
the year, its fixed manufacturing costs aren’t easily scaled down. The business is stuck with
these costs over the short run.
The fixed manufacturing overhead cost component of product cost is called the burden rate.
The burden rate of Company X for the year is computed as follows (see Figure 11-1 for data):
$42,000,000 total fixed manufacturing overhead costs for year ÷ 120,000 units production
output for period = $350 burden rate

Part III: Managerial, Manufacturing, and Capital Accounting 
Now, here’s a very important twist on the example: Suppose Company X manufactured only
110,000 units during the period — equal to the quantity sold during the year. Its variable
manufacturing costs equal $410.00 per unit. This per unit cost remains the same at the lower
production output level. In contrast, the burden rate would be $381.82 per unit at the lower
production output level ($42,000,000 total fixed manufacturing overhead costs ÷ 110,000
units production output = $381.82 burden rate). The higher burden rate causes product cost
to be $31.82 higher.
A key point of this example is that Company X’s product cost is $31.82 higher simply because
it produces fewer units. The same total amount of fixed manufacturing overhead costs is
spread over fewer units of production output. The higher product cost means that cost of
goods sold expense is higher, and therefore, operating profit is lower. At the 120,000 units pro-
duction output level, operating profit is $15,950,000 (see Figure 11-1). But at the 110,000 units
production output level, operating profit dips to $12,450,000, which is a decrease of
$3,500,000. This decrease gets the attention of business managers, that’s for sure!
Q.
What would be the operating profit of Company X if its production output for the year had been
110,000 units (equal to the number of units sold) instead of the 120,000 units production output
level assumed in Figure 11-1?

Company Y was on track to sell 550,000
units in the year, but late in the year, a
major customer canceled a large order for
50,000 units. The business reduced its pro-

in Figure 11-2. Determine the operating

Boosting profit by boosting production
In the Company X example shown in Figure 11-1, cost of goods sold expense for the year ben-
efits from the fact that the business produced 10,000 more units than it sold during the year.
These 10,000 units absorbed $3,500,000 of its total fixed manufacturing overhead costs for the
year. The cost of goods sold expense escaped $3,500,000 in fixed manufacturing overhead
costs because the company produced 10,000 more units than it sold during the year, thus
pushing down the burden rate (see the preceding section for an explanation of burden rate).
Until the units are sold, the $3,500,000 stays in the inventory asset account (along with vari-
able manufacturing costs, of course).
The distribution of the company’s fixed manufacturing overhead costs for the year is summa-
rized as follows:
Total Fixed Manufacturing
$38,500,000 Cost of Goods Sold Expense
Overhead Costs for Year
$42,000,000
(110,000 units sold during the year
(Divided by 120,000 unit                                                  times $350.00 burden rate)

Part III: Managerial, Manufacturing, and Capital Accounting 
Of its $42,000,000 total fixed manufacturing overhead costs for the year, only
$38,500,000 ended up in cost of goods sold expense for the year ($350 burden rate ×
110,000 units sold= $38,500,000). The other $3,500,000 ended up in the inventory asset
account ($350 burden rate × 10,000 units inventory increase = $3,500,000). I’m not sug-
gesting any funny business, but Company X did help its operating profit to the tune of
$3,500,000 by producing 10,000 more units than it sold. Suppose that the business had
produced only 110,000 units, equal to its sales volume for the year. All its fixed manu-
facturing overhead costs would have gone into cost of goods sold expense, and oper-
ating profit would have been that much lower.
It’s entirely possible that Company X’s 120,000 units production output level is justi-
fied as a way to have more units on hand for sales growth next year. But the produc-
tion output decision can get out of hand. A manufacturer may deliberately pump up
production output not to prepare for sales growth next year but to pump up profit
this year, and that’s massaging the numbers, pure and simple. It falls short of cooking
the books, which involves fraudulent accounting practices that are untruthful or ficti-
tious. Nevertheless, pushing up production output for the sole purpose of boosting
profit definitely smacks of accounting manipulation.
You need to judge whether an inventory increase is justified. Be aware that an unjusti-
fied increase may be evidence of profit manipulation or just good old-fashioned man-
agement bungling. The day of reckoning will come when the products are sold and
the cost of inventory becomes cost of goods sold expense.
In Figure 11-1, Company X’s production capacity for the year is 150,000 units. It pro-
duced only 120,000 units during the year, which is 30,000 units fewer than it could
have. In other words, it operated at 80 percent of production capacity (120,000 units
output ÷ 150,000 units capacity = 80 percent utilization), which is 20 percent idle
capacity. (The average U.S. manufacturing plant normally operates at 80 to 85 percent
of its production capacity.) Production capacity, to remind you, is the maximum
output that a business could achieve during a period of time given its machinery,
equipment, buildings and land, labor force, and other necessary manufacturing fac-
tors. Idle capacity is the difference between actual output during the period and pro-
duction capacity. The term “idle” may be too pejorative. Most manufacturers, as a
matter of fact, do not run at full production capacity. So, some idle (unused) produc-
tion capacity is normal.
Running at 80 percent of production capacity, this business’s burden rate for the year
is $350 per unit ($42,000,000 total fixed manufacturing overhead costs ÷ 120,000 units
output = $350 burden rate). As I explain earlier in this section, the burden rate would
be higher if the company produced only 110,000 units during the year. The burden
rate, in other words, is sensitive to the number of units produced. This connection
can lead to all kinds of mischief.
Suppose that Company X manufactures 150,000 units during the year and increases its
inventory 40,000 units, which may be a legitimate move if the business is anticipating a
big jump in sales next year. On the other hand, an inventory increase of 40,000 units in
a year in which only 110,000 units were sold may be the result of a serious overproduc-
tion mistake, and the larger inventory may not be needed next year.

241
Chapter 11: Manufacturing Cost Accounting
Q.
In the Figure 11-1 scenario Company X manufactured 120,000 units during the year, which caused its
inventory to increase 10,000 units. Suppose, instead, that the company had manufactured 150,000
units during the year, which is its production capacity. Assume sales and other factors were the
same in this alternative scenario as shown in Figure 11-1 – only production output is different. What
would be its operating profit for the year if it had produced 150,000 units? 
A.
The following operating profit report and summary of manufacturing activity for Company X shows
what would have happened at the 150,000 units production output level. Remember that sales
volume doesn’t change in this scenario; only production output changes. Comparative data is pre-
sented for the 120,000 units production output level in the original scenario (see Figure 11-1).
Check out the $23,650,000 operating profit when production output is 150,000 units, compared with
the $15,950,000 operating profit when production output is 120,000 units — a $7,700,000 difference
even though sales volume, sales prices, and operating expenses all remain the same. Whoa! What’s
going on here? The simple answer is that the cost of goods sold expense is $7,700,000 less than
before. How can cost of goods sold expense be less if the business sells 110,000 units in both scenar-
ios, and variable manufacturing costs are $410.00 per unit in both cases?
The culprit is the burden rate component of product cost. In Figure 11-1, total fixed manufacturing
costs are spread over 120,000 units of output, giving a $350 burden rate per unit. In Figure 11-3, total
fixed manufacturing costs are spread over 150,000 units output, giving the much lower $280 burden
rate, or $70 per unit less. The $70 lower burden rate multiplied by the 110,000 units sold reduces
cost of goods sold expense $7,700,000 and increases operating profit the same amount.

If the business had produced 150,000 units (its production capacity), its inventory would
have increased 40,000 units. This increase is quite large compared to the annual sales of
110,000 for the year just ended. Who was responsible for the decision to go full blast and
produce up to production capacity? Do the managers really expect sales to jump up enough
next year to justify the much larger inventory level? If their guess is right, they look brilliant.
But if the output level was a mistake and sales don’t go up next year . . . they have you-
know-what to pay, even though profit looks good this year. An experienced business man-
ager knows to be on guard when inventory takes such a big jump.

11. Towards the end of the year, the president of Company Y looks at the preliminary numbers for
operating profit and doesn’t like what he sees. He’s “promised” the board of directors that operat-
ing profit for the year will come in at $4,850,000. In fact, his bonus depends on hitting that operat-
ing profit target. There is still time before the end of the year to crank up production output for
the year. Therefore, he orders that production output be stepped up. The president asks you to
determine what the production output level for the year would have to be in order to report
$4,850,000 operating profit for the year. Of course, you have ethical qualms about doing this, but
you need the job. So, you reluctantly decide to do the calculation. Determine the production
output level that would yield $4,850,000 operating profit for the year.

12. Refer to your answer to Question 10, in which Company Z produces only 2,000,000 units during
the year. In the scenario shown in Figure 11-2, the business manufactures 2,500,000 units, which is
its maximum production output for the year. Do you think that Company Z cranked up production
output to 2,500,000 units mainly to boost its operating profit for the year?
Solve It
Calculating Product Cost in Unusual Situations
The basic calculation model for product cost is:
Total manufacturing costs for period ÷ Total units produced during period = 
Product cost per unit
Total manufacturing costs for the period includes direct manufacturing costs that can be
clearly identified with a particular product and indirect manufacturing costs that are allo-
cated to the product.

This product cost calculation method is appropriate in most situations. However, it has to be
modified in two extreme situations:
 When manufacturing costs are grossly excessive or wasteful due to inefficient produc-
tion operations
 When production output is significantly less than normal capacity utilization
Suppose that Company X had to throw away $1,200,000 of raw materials during the year
because they weren’t stored properly and ended up being unusable in the production
process. The manager in charge of the warehouse received a stiff reprimand.
243
Chapter 11: Manufacturing Cost Accounting
Q.
In Figure 11-1, which shows Company X’s operating profit performance and summary of manufac-
turing activity for the year, it is assumed that there were no wasteful manufacturing costs. In 
this question, assume, instead, that the business had to throw away $1,200,000 of unusable raw
materials. How should the $1,200,000 cost of raw materials that were thrown out be presented in
the operating profit report and summary of manufacturing activity?
A.
The $1,200,000 cost of raw materials that were wasted and not used in production should not be
included in the calculation of product cost. The $1,200,000 cost of wasted raw materials should be
treated as a period cost, which means that it’s recorded as an expense in the period. The operating
profit report and summary of manufacturing activity for the year in this scenario is as follows:

The $1,200,000 wasted raw materials cost is recorded as an expense in the year, as you see

amount in the manufacturing activity summary for the year with the result that product
cost drops to $750 per unit.

13. The president of Company X is puzzled by the operating profit report and summary of manufac-
turing activity for the year, in which $1,200,000 raw materials cost was wasted and charged to
expense in the year. He expected that operating profit would be $1,200,000 lower (as compared to
the scenario in Figure 11-1, in which there’s no wasted raw materials cost). Operating profit in the
wasted raw materials scenario is only $100,000 lower than in Figure 11-1. Explain to the president
why operating profit is only $100,000 lower.
Solve It
14. After Company Y’s operating profit report and summary of manufacturing activity for the year has
been prepared (see Figure 11-2), you, the chief accountant, learn that $1,000,000 of raw materials
were thrown away during the year because the items had spoiled and couldn’t be used in the
manufacturing process. The company’s president knows about this loss and insists that no
change be made in the operating profit report and summary of manufacturing activity. Do you go
along with the president, or do you argue for changing the operating profit report and summary of
manufacturing activity?
Solve It

As I mention earlier, unused production capacity is called idle capacity. One argument is that
the cost of idle capacity should be charged off as a period cost (that is, charged directly to
expense in the year and not included in product cost). Generally, the cost of idle capacity is
calculated as follows:
Percent of idle capacity × Fixed manufacturing overhead costs = Cost of idle capacity
Refer to Company Y’s operating profit report and summary of manufacturing activity for the
year (Figure 11-2). Its annual production capacity is 800,000 units, but it produced only
500,000 units during the year. The company’s idle capacity is 37.5 percent. In this case, the
idle capacity cost is calculated as follows:
37.5 percent idle capacity × $8,000,000 fixed manufacturing overhead costs = $3,000,000
cost of idle capacity
245
Chapter 11: Manufacturing Cost Accounting
Q.
How would Company Y’s operating profit report and summary of manufacturing activity be
revised if the cost of idle capacity is treated as a period cost in the year?
A.
The $3,000,000 cost of idle capacity is taken out of fixed manufacturing overhead costs and moved
up to the operating profit report as an expense in the period. The revised operating profit report
and summary of manufacturing activity, which you may find somewhat surprising, is as follows:

Part III: Managerial, Manufacturing, and Capital Accounting 
Allocating indirect costs is as simple as ABC . . . not!
Most manufacturers make many different products. Just
think of General Motors or Ford and the number of dif-
ferent car and truck models they assemble. If a separate
production plant (building, machinery, equipment, tools,
workforce, and so on) were dedicated to making only
one product, all manufacturing costs would be direct
costs to that one particular product. But in reality, it’s the
other way around: One production plant is used to make
many different products. The result is that many pro-
duction costs are indirect to the different products man-
ufactured by the business.
Indirect manufacturing costs are allocated among the
products produced during the period. Therefore, prod-
uct cost includes both direct and indirect manufacturing
costs. Coming up with a completely satisfactory alloca-
tion method is difficult and ends up being somewhat
arbitrary — but it must be done in order to determine
product cost.
Accountants have developed many methods and
schemes for allocating indirect overhead costs, many of
which are based on some common denominator of pro-
duction activity, such as direct labor hours. A different
method that has gotten a lot of press is called activity-
based costing (ABC).
With the ABC method, you identify each necessary, sup-
porting activity in the production process and collect
costs into a separate pool for each identified activity.
Then you develop a measure for each activity — for
example, the measure for the engineering department
may be hours, and the measure for the maintenance
department may be square feet. You use the activity
measures as cost drivers to allocate cost to products.
So if Product A needs 200 hours of the engineering
department’s time, and Product B is a simple product
that needs only 20 hours of engineering, you allocate ten
times as much of the engineering cost to Product A.
The idea is that the engineering department doesn’t
come cheap; including the cost of their slide rules and
pocket protectors as well as their salaries and benefits,
the total cost per hour for those engineers could be $150
to $200, or more. The logic of the ABC cost-allocation
method is that the engineering cost per hour should be
allocated on the basis of the number of hours (the driver)
required by each product. In similar fashion, suppose the
cost of the maintenance department is $20 per square
foot per year. If Product C uses twice as much floor
space as Product D, you charge it with twice as much
maintenance cost.
The ABC method has received much praise for being
better than traditional allocation methods, especially for
management decision-making. However, you should
keep in mind that it requires rather arbitrary definitions of
cost drivers, and having too many different cost drivers,
each with its own pool of costs, isn’t practical.
Managers should be aware of which cost allocation
methods are being used by their companies and should
challenge a method if they think that it’s misleading and
should be replaced with a better (though still somewhat
arbitrary) method. I don’t mean to put too fine a point on
this, but to a large extent, cost allocation boils down to
a “my arbitrary method is better than your arbitrary
method” argument.
Note that changing the handling of the cost of idle capacity produces no difference in the
company’s operating profit for the year. Is this surprising, or what? In this example, the
company produces the same number of units it sells during the year. Thus, there’s no
“inventory effect.” One-hundred percent of its manufacturing costs for the year end up in
expense regardless of the way in which the idle capacity is handled. In Figure 11-2, the
entire $8,000,000 fixed manufacturing overhead costs ends up in cost of goods sold expense.
In this example scenario, $3,000,000 of the fixed costs end up in a period expense account
(Cost of Idle Capacity), and the other $5,000,000 ends up in cost of goods sold expense.

15. Assume that Company Z manufactures 2,100,000 units during the year (instead of the 2,500,000
units production output shown in Figure 11-2). Determine its operating profit for the year. Assume
that the cost of idle capacity is treated as a period cost and isn’t embedded in product cost.
Solve It
16. Refer to Company X’s operating profit report and summary of manufacturing activity presented in
Figure 11-1. Note that its annual production capacity is 150,000 units, but the business manufac-
tured only 120,000 units during the year. Therefore, it had 20 percent idle capacity (30,000 units
not produced ÷ 150,000 units production capacity = 20 percent idle capacity). However, the cost of
idle capacity isn’t treated as a separate period cost; all the company’s fixed manufacturing over-
head costs are included in calculating its product cost.
Suppose that the business treats the cost of idle capacity as a period cost. Prepare a revised oper-
ating profit report and summary of manufacturing activity for the business.

Answers to Problems on Manufacturing 
Cost Accounting
The following are the answers to the practice questions presented earlier in this chapter.
a
The company’s total manufacturing costs for the year are $91,200,000 (see Figure 11-1), but only
$83,600,000 is charged to cost of goods expense. What happened to the other $7,600,000
($91,200,000 manufacturing costs for year – $83,600,000 cost of goods sold expense for year =
$7,600,000)?
The business produced 120,000 units, which is 10,000 more units than the 110,000 units it sold
during the year. Therefore, 1⁄12 (10,000 ÷ 120,000) of its total manufacturing costs is allocated to
the increase in inventory, and 11/12 is allocated to cost of goods sold during the year:
11⁄12 × $91,200,000 total manufacturing costs = $83,600,000 allocated to cost of goods sold
expense
1⁄12 × $91,200,000 total manufacturing costs = $7,600,000 allocated to inventory
You can also answer this question by using product cost and number of units sold during 
the year:
$760 product cost × 110,000 units sold during year = $83,600,000 cost allocated to cost of
goods sold expense
$760 product cost × 10,000 units increase in inventory = $7,600,000 cost allocated to 
inventory
b
As you can see in Figure 11-1, Company X recorded $42,000,000 fixed manufacturing overhead
costs in the year. Suppose, instead, that its fixed manufacturing overhead costs were $45,600,000
for the year, which is an increase of $3,600,000. Would the company’s operating profit have been
$3,600,000 lower? (Assume that variable manufacturing costs per unit and operating expenses
remain the same.)
No, operating profit would not be $3,600,000 lower. The following schedule shows that operat-
ing profit would be $3,300,000 lower. The higher fixed manufacturing overhead costs drive up
the product cost per unit, from $760 to $790, or $30 per unit. However, the business sold only
110,000 units, so the $30 higher product cost per unit increases cost of goods sold expense only
$3,300,000 ($30 increase in product cost × 110,000 units sales volume = $3,300,000). Therefore,
operating profit decreases $3,300,000.

Chapter 11: Manufacturing Cost Accounting
The operating profit decrease still leaves $300,000 of the total $3,600,000 fixed manufacturing
overhead costs increase to explain. The 10,000 units increase in inventory absorbs this addi-
tional amount of fixed manufacturing overhead costs; including fixed manufacturing overhead
costs in product cost is called absorption costing. Some accountants argue that product cost
should include only variable manufacturing costs and not include any fixed manufacturing
overhead costs. This practice is called direct costing, or variable costing, and it isn’t generally
accepted. Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) require that fixed manufacturing
overhead cost must be included in product cost.
c
Suppose that Company X uses the FIFO method instead of the LIFO method shown in Figure
11-1. The company starts the year with 25,000 units in beginning inventory at a cost of $735 per
unit according to the FIFO method. During the year, it manufactures 120,000 units and sells
110,000 units (see Figure 11-1). Determine Company X’s cost of goods sold expense for the year
and its cost of ending inventory using the FIFO method.
The business started the year with 25,000 units at $735 per unit for a total cost of $18,375,000,
which constitutes one batch of inventory. The business manufactured 120,000 units during the
year at $760 per unit for a total cost of $91,200,000, which constitutes the second batch of
inventory. 
Under FIFO, the cost of goods sold expense is determined as follows:
25,000 units × $735 = $18,375,000
85,000 units × $760 = $64,600,000
110,000 units sold
= $82,975,000
Under FIFO, the ending inventory consists of one layer:
35,000 units × $760 = $26,600,000
d
Company X produced 120,000 units and sold 110,000 units during the year (see Figure 11-1).
Therefore, the company increased its inventory 10,000 units. Does this increase seem reason-
able? Or is the company’s production output compared with its sales volume out of kilter?
It’s hard to say for sure whether the increased inventory is reasonable. The key factor is the
forecasted sales volume for next year. If the business predicts moderate sales volume growth
next year, then increasing inventory 10,000 units seems reasonable. On the other hand, if the
sales forecast is flat for next year, why did the business produce more than it sold during the
year just ended? The inventory increase could have been a mistake, or taking a more cynical
view, perhaps the business deliberately manufactured more units than it sold in order to boost
operating profit for the year.

Refer to Figure 11-2 for the operating profit report and manufacturing activity summary of

Assume that Company Y uses the LIFO method to charge out raw materials to production. In
this question, assume that supply shortages of raw materials meant that Company Y couldn’t
purchase all the raw materials it needed for production during the year, and it had to draw
down its raw materials inventory. Fortunately, it had an adequate beginning inventory of raw
materials to cover the gap in purchases during the year. In this situation, would the cost of raw
materials issued to production be different than the $7,500,000 shown in Figure 11-2?
Yes, the cost of raw materials charged to production probably would be lower because the
beginning inventory or raw materials probably is on the books at a lower cost per unit com-
pared with current purchase prices. This “aging” of inventory cost is one disadvantage of the
LIFO method, which I discuss in Chapter 9. When a business dips into its beginning inventory
because it uses more materials than it was able to buy during the period, it has to charge out
the raw materials at the costs recorded in its inventory account. These costs may go back sev-
eral years, and in the meantime, the costs of raw materials have probably escalated to higher
prices per unit. If the difference is significant, the chief accountant should warn managers that
the raw materials component of product cost is lower than normal because of a LIFO liquidation
effect — not because of more efficient production methods or lower raw material purchase
prices during the year.
h
Determine what Company Z’s operating profit would be if it had sold 2,100,000 units during the
year, which is 100,000 more units than in the example shown in Figure 11-2. Assume that pro-
duction output had remained the same at 2,500,000 units (the company’s production output
capacity).
The business manufactured 500,000 more units than it sold during the year (see Figure 11-2).
Therefore, it certainly had 100,000 additional units available for sale; indeed, it had 500,000
additional units available for sale without having to reach into its beginning quantity of inven-
tory. An additional 100,000 units of sales is only a 5 percent increase (100,000 additional units ÷
2,000,000 units sales volume = 5 percent.) So, the company’s fixed operating expenses probably
would not increase at the higher sales volume level.
The company’s product cost would be the same at the higher sales level and its fixed operating
costs would hold the same. Therefore, its operating profit would increase $405,000:
$4.05 contribution margin per unit × 100,000 additional units sold = $405,000 operating profit
increase
In other words, Company Z’s operating profit would increase from $600,000 to $1,005,000, which
is an increase of 67.5 percent. But don’t get too excited — this large percent increase is due
mainly to the low base of only $600,000 operating profit. Nevertheless, the business certainly
could have reported a much better operating profit if it had sold just 5 percent more units.
i
Company Y was on track to sell 550,000 units in the year, but late in the year, a major customer
canceled a large order for 50,000 units. The business reduced its production output to 500,000
units, as you see in Figure 11-2. Determine the operating profit Company Y would have earned if
it had manufactured and sold 550,000 units in the year.
Company Y would have earned $4,875,000 operating profit, as the following schedule shows.

Chapter 11: Manufacturing Cost Accounting
The canceled order for 50,000 units hit operating profit hard: The company’s operating profit
fell $1,625,000 as the result, from $4,875,000 (see schedule above) to $3,250,000 (see Figure 11-2,
in which only 500,000 units are sold).
The company has unused production capacity (see Figure 11-2), so producing an additional
50,000 units wouldn’t have increased its fixed manufacturing overhead costs. And, its fixed
operating costs would not have increased at the higher sales level. The company’s variable
operating expenses equal $12.50 per unit, and its variable manufacturing costs equal $40.00 per
unit. Thus, its total variable costs equal $52.50 per unit. Manufacturing and selling 50,000 addi-
tional units causes costs to increase $2,625,000 ($52.50 variable costs per unit × 50,000 units =
$2,625,000). Selling an additional 50,000 units increases sales revenue $4,250,000 ($85.00 sales
price × 50,000 units = $4,250,000). Therefore,
Incremental sales revenue from additional 50,000 units
= $4,250,000
Incremental costs from additional 50,000 units
= ($2,625,000)
Incremental operating profit from additional 50,000 units = $1,625,000
This calculation is an example of marginal analysis, on analyzing things on the edge. The focus
is on the 50,000 units that the company didn’t sell (but came close to selling).
j
Assume that Company Z’s production output for the year is 2,000,000 units (instead of 2,500,000
units as in Figure 11-2). In other words, assume that the business manufactures the same number
of units that it sells in the year. Assume all other manufacturing and operating factors are the
same. Determine the company’s operating profit for the year.
In this scenario, the company suffers a $1,000,000 operating loss. See the following schedule:

Part III: Managerial, Manufacturing, and Capital Accounting 
By producing only 2,000,000 units, the company’s burden rate increases to $4.00 per unit from
the $3.20 burden rate when it produces 2,500,000 units (see Figure 11-2). This is an increase 
of $.80 per unit, which decreases Company Z’s contribution margin per unit from $4.05 to 
$3.25 per unit. The company records $.80 less profit on each unit sold, so on its 2,000,000 units
sales volume its operating profit drops $1,600,000 – from $600,000 profit (see Figure 11-2) to
$1,000,000 loss. It appears that the business boosted production output to 2,500,000 units in
order to show a profit for the year. As the result, Company Z’s stuck with a surplus inventory
that it will have to do something with in the year(s) ahead.
k
Towards the end of the year, the president of Company Y looks at the preliminary numbers for
operating profit and doesn’t like what he sees. He’s “promised” the board of directors that
operating profit for the year will come in at $4,850,000. In fact, his bonus depends on hitting
that operating profit target. There is still time before the end of the year to crank up production
output for the year. Therefore, he orders that production output be stepped up. The president
asks you to determine what the production output level for the year would have to be in order
to report $4,850,000 operating profit for the year. Of course, you have ethical qualms about
doing this, but you need the job. So, you reluctantly decide to do the calculation. Determine 
the production output level that would yield $4,850,000 operating profit for the year.
The following schedule shows that if the business manufactures 625,000 units, its operating
profit will be $4,850,000:
The president wants $1,600,000 more profit than shown in Figure 11-2 ($4,850,000 profit 
target – $3,250,000 profit at 500,000 units production level = $1,600,000 additional profit). 
The only profit driver that changes with a higher production level is the burden rate, which has
to decline $3.20 per unit in order to achieve the additional profit ($1,600,000 additional profit
wanted ÷ 500,000 units sales volume = $3.20 decrease needed in burden rate). The burden rate
has to decrease $3.20, from $16.00 (see Figure 11-2) to $12.80. The production output level has
to be 625,000 units to get the burden rate down to $12.80 ($8,000,000 fixed manufacturing over-
head costs ÷ $12.80 burden rate = 625,000 units).

Chapter 11: Manufacturing Cost Accounting
Whether it’s ethical and above board to jack up production to 625,000 units when sales are 
only 500,000 units for the year is a serious question. The members of Company Y’s board of
directors should definitely challenge the president on why such a large inventory increase is
needed. I would, that’s for sure!
l
Refer to your answer to Question 10, in which Company Z produces only 2,000,000 units during
the year. In the scenario shown in Figure 11-2, the business manufactures 2,500,000 units, which
is its maximum production output for the year. Do you think that Company Z cranked up pro-
duction output to 2,500,000 units mainly to boost its operating profit for the year?
No one wants to jump to conclusions, but it would appear that boosting operating profit very
well may be the reason for Company Z’s high production output level. Put another way, the
chief executive of the business has to justify the large inventory increase based on legitimate
reasons, such as a big jump in sales forecast for next year or a looming strike of employees that
will shut down the company’s production for several months. Otherwise, the ugly truth is that
the business is engaging in some earnings management, also called massaging the numbers.
Sophisticated readers of the company’s financial statements will notice the large jump in inven-
tory in the balance sheet, and they may press top management for an explanation. Therefore,
the attempt at accounting manipulation may not work.
m
The president of Company X is puzzled by the operating profit report and summary of manufac-
turing activity for the year, in which $1,200,000 raw materials cost was wasted and charged to
expense in the year. He expected that operating profit would be $1,200,000 lower (as compared
to the scenario in Figure 11-1, in which there’s no wasted raw materials cost). Operating profit
in the wasted raw materials scenario is only $100,000 lower than in Figure 11-1. Explain to the
president why operating profit is only $100,000 lower.
The president is asking about the impact on operating profit. If the $1,200,000 cost of wasted raw
materials is included in the calculation of product cost $1,100,000 of it ends up in cost of goods
sold expense because 110,000 of the 120,000 units produced were sold during the year. The other
$100,000 is absorbed in the inventory increase. In contrast, if the $1,200,000 is charged to expense
directly, none of it escapes into the inventory increase. So in one scenario, profit is hit with
$1,100,000 expense and in the other scenario profit is hit with $1,200,000 expense. The operating
profit difference is only $100,000.
n
After Company Y’s operating profit report and summary of manufacturing activity for the year
has been prepared (see Figure 11-2), you, the chief accountant, learn that $1,000,000 of raw
materials were thrown away during the year because the items had spoiled and couldn’t be
used in the manufacturing process. The company’s president knows about this loss and insists
that no change be made in the operating profit report and summary of manufacturing activity.
Do you go along with the president, or do you argue for changing the operating profit report
and summary of manufacturing activity?
If you haven’t read my answer to Problem 13, please read it. In that scenario the net error in
operating profit is only $100,000 because most of the cost of wasted materials had flowed
through to cost of goods sold expense. In this case all of the cost of wasted materials ends up
in the cost of goods sold expense, so operating profit is correct. The reason is that all of the
manufacturing costs for the year are charged to cost of goods sold because all of the com-
pany’s output for the year was sold. Note that its entire $28,000,000 manufacturing costs is
charged to cost of goods sold expense. (Remember that the company uses the LIFO method.)
Therefore, the argument in this situation is really about how to classify costs in the internal
operating profit report to managers. Would it be better to report a separate cost of wasted raw
materials? Yes, I think so. Hopefully, this is a cost the company can avoid from happening again.
If the error is not corrected, the managers would be misled into thinking that the true product
cost is $16.00, when in fact it is $2.00 lower ($1,000,000 cost of wasted raw materials ÷ 500,000
units production output = $2.00 per unit error).

Assume that Company Z manufactures 2,100,000 units during the year (instead of the 2,500,000
units production output shown in Figure 11-2). Determine its operating profit for the year. Assume
that the cost of idle capacity is treated as a period cost and isn’t embedded in product cost.
The company’s operating loss is $680,000, as the following schedule shows.
The company has 16 percent idle capacity in this scenario (400,000 units not produced ÷
2,500,000 units capacity = 16 percent idle capacity). So, 16 percent of its $8,000,000 fixed manu-
facturing overhead costs, or $1,280,000, is removed from the calculation of product cost and
treated as a period cost. This action reduces operating profit for the year by this amount, of
course.
p
Refer to Company X’s operating profit report and summary of manufacturing activity presented
in Figure 11-1. Note that its annual production capacity is 150,000 units, but the business manu-
factured only 120,000 units during the year. Therefore, it had 20 percent idle capacity (30,000
units not produced ÷ 150,000 units production capacity = 20 percent idle capacity). However, in
the Figure 11-1 scenario, the cost of idle capacity isn’t treated as a separate period cost; all the
company’s fixed manufacturing overhead costs are included in calculating its product cost.
Suppose that the business treats the cost of idle capacity as a period cost. Prepare a revised
operating profit report and summary of manufacturing activity for the business.
Company X’s operating profit would be $15,250,000, as the following schedule shows.

Chapter 11: Manufacturing Cost Accounting
Note that the company’s operating profit decreases a relatively small amount, only $700,000,
due to treating idle capacity as a period costs instead of a product cost. In Figure 11-1, operat-
ing profit is $15,950,000, and in this schedule, it’s $15,250,000, or $700,000 less. This $700,000 is
“buried” in the ending inventory cost under the method shown in Figure 11-1; in other words, 
in the scenario shown in Figure 11-1, the cost of idle capacity is included in the $760 product
cost. The product cost is $70 higher than the $690 product cost in this schedule (in which 
idle capacity is pulled out of manufacturing and treated as a period cost). The company sold
110,000 units, and the other 10,000 units of its production output increase its inventory. These
10,000 units absorb $700,000 of the idle capacity cost (10,000 units inventory increase × $70
higher burden rate = $700,000 absorbed by inventory increase).

 Figuring return on investment
I
n my experience, most people are a little fuzzy on interest and return on investment.
Sure, most people know that interest is the cost of borrowing money or the income from
saving money. And they know that they should earn a return on their investments. However,
when put in a specific borrowing, saving, or investing situation, people aren’t sure how
interest is calculated and exactly what different interest rates mean. And they’re in a fog
regarding how rates of return on investments are determined and the assumptions behind
these measures of investment performance.
The better you understand interest and return on investment, the better economic citizen
and intelligent investor you will be. In this chapter, I explain how interest works and how
investment performance is measured using rates of return. I think you’ll find more than a few
surprises as you go through it.
The Apollo 13 astronauts became famous for their message, “Houston, we have a problem.”
The inherent problem in this chapter is that, by their very nature, interest and return on
investment require calculations. However, most people have their enthusiasm for number
crunching under control (except for accountants and actuaries). I don’t throw a bunch of
mathematical formulas at you in this chapter (that would turn you off for sure). Instead, I use
transparent examples that demonstrate how interest works and how to determine return on
investment. In sports, becoming a better player takes practicing and scrimmaging. In
accounting, the best means for improving your understanding of interest and return on
investment is practicing and scrimmaging with realistic examples.
Getting Down the Basics of Interest
Any explanation of interest has to start with what’s called simple interest — although, it’s not
as simple as the term implies.

Keeping it simple with simple interest
The idea behind simple interest is that a certain amount of interest is paid or earned on a cer-
tain amount of money for a certain period of time, say one year. Suppose you put $1,000 
in a savings account at the start of the year. At the end of the year your savings account was
credited (increased) $40 for the interest you earned. The simple interest rate you earned is
calculated as follows:
$40 interest earned ÷ $1,000 amount invested for one year = 4.0 percent simple 
interest rate
But, what if you earned $10 each quarter instead of $40 at the end of the year? Things get
more complicated, as I explain in the chapter.
260
Part III: Managerial, Manufacturing, and Capital Accounting 
Q.
Suppose you’ve filled out all the forms and
convinced a bank to loan your business
$100,000. The bank has examined your
three “Cs”: character, collateral, and cash
flow. The terms of the loan are that the
bank will put $100,000 in your checking
account today; the maturity of the loan is
one year later; and, the annual interest 
rate on the loan is 6 percent. (The loan is
renewable, but that’s another topic.) What
amount do you have to pay the bank one
year later, on the maturity date, to pay off
this loan?
A.
You can probably solve this problem in your
head without doing any calculations on a
hand held business/finance calculator or
using Excel. I modify this simple example
later in the chapter in order to explore sev-
eral other important features of interest, so I
want to be very clear about how interest is
calculated for this basic example.
In this example, interest is added to the
amount borrowed to determine the matu-
rity value of the loan, which is the amount
payable to the bank on the maturity date.
The amount borrowed, which is called the
face value or principal of the loan, is the
basis for calculating interest. The amount
of interest is calculated as follows:
$100,000 amount borrowed today ×
6 percent annual interest rate = $6,000
interest on loan
$100,000 amount borrowed today +
$6,000 interest on loan = $106,000 
maturity value of loan one year later
How do you do those calculations?
You’re probably asking, “How do I actually do the calcu-
lations in this chapter?” Well, you have two basic
choices for doing interest and return on investment 
calculations: You can use either a business/financial 
calculator or the Excel spreadsheet program from
Microsoft. I use both of these tools, with the complexity
of the calculation making the actual determination.
Hewlett-Packard and Texas Instruments make excellent
hand held business/financial calculators. I recommend
them highly. If you use a computer-based spreadsheet,
Excel is basically your only option. Fortunately, Excel
runs equally well on both Windows and Macintosh com-
puter platforms.
With both a business/financial calculator and Excel, you
have to spend a little time familiarizing yourself with the
tool and how to use it — that’s the rub. (When’s the last
time you actually read a users’ manual?) As I proceed
with the examples in this chapter — which get more and
more complicated — I include useful hints about doing
calculations either with a hand-held business/financial
calculator or in Excel.

One year later you pay back to the bank 6 percent more than the bank loaned to you today,
which means that the annual interest rate is 6 percent. Whether this interest rate is too high
or not is up to you. You may want to shop around at different banks and other lenders to
see if you can get a better interest rate.

Chapter 12: Figuring Out Interest and Return on Investment
1.
Suppose your company borrows $500,000
from a bank, and that amount is deposited
in your checking account today. The note
that you sign calls for a 6.25 percent annual
interest rate. Determine the maturity value
(the amount you will pay the bank when
the note comes due then) of the note one
year from now.
Solve It
2.
Suppose you sign a note that calls for
$868,000 to be paid to the lender one year
from today. (In other words, the maturity
value of the loan one year from today is
$868,000.) The lender gives you $800,000
today in exchange for this note. There’s 
no mention of the rate of interest on this
loan. What is the annual interest rate on
this loan?
Solve It
The legal instrument used for the contract between a borrower and a lender is fairly compli-
cated and has many clauses and provisions. Generally, the borrower signs a promissory note
to the lender. You need a lawyer to fully explain the terms, conditions, obligations, and rights
of each party under the loan agreement.
Q.
Suppose the lender does not refer to an
annual interest rate and does not refer to
the amount you borrow. You sign a legal
instrument (probably a promissory note)
that calls for the payment of $106,000 at
the maturity date of the loan (one year
later). The bank puts $100,000 in your
checking account today. Is the annual 
interest rate on this loan still 6 percent?
A.
Yes, the annual interest rate is still 
6 percent. Why? Well, the interest rate is
calculated on the basis of the amount
received at the start of the loan. So, the
interest rate is calculated as follows:
$106,000 maturity value of loan one 
year later – $100,000 received today
when signing the note payable = 
$6,000 interest for one year
$6,000 interest for one year ÷ $100,000
received at start of loan = 6 percent
annual interest rate

262
Part III: Managerial, Manufacturing, and Capital Accounting 
3.
Refer to Question 1. Suppose the date on
the note is March 1, 2006 — this is the date
the note was signed and the money was
put in the company’s checking account
with the bank. It’s now August 31, 2006,
which is the close of the company’s fiscal
year. Should an adjusting entry for interest
expense be recorded? If so, make the jour-
nal entry.
Solve It
4.
Refer to Question 2. Because the note
payable calls for a payment of $868,000 at
the maturity date, the bookkeeper thinks
that this amount should be recorded as a
liability and that the difference between
this liability amount and the $800,000 pro-
ceeds received by the business should be
debited to the prepaid expenses asset
account. Do you agree?
Solve It
Distinguishing nominal and effective interest rates
Assume a business borrows $100,000 for one year at an annual interest rate of 6 percent. One
alternative is that the bank charges 6 percent simple interest that is payable at the end of the
year. In this case the business pays the bank $106,000 (which includes $6,000 interest) at the
maturity date one year later. Now here’s a twist that happens all the time: Instead of 6 per-
cent simple interest that is figured once a year, assume that the bank quotes a 6 percent
annual interest rate that is compounded quarterly, which means it wants to be paid interest
every three months. Does this make a difference? It sure does, and it makes the calculation of
interest more complicated.
When used in reference to an annual rate of interest, compounding refers to the frequency of
charging (or earning) interest during the year. The annual rate has to be converted into the
interest rate per period. Assuming the lender charges interest quarterly, the 6 percent annual
rate is divided by four to get the 1.5 percent interest rate per quarter. In the example just
introduced, the business could pay $1,500 at the end of each quarter ($100,000 × 1.5 percent
interest rate per quarter = $1,500 interest per quarter). This way, the bank collects interest
income earlier and can put the money to work sooner. On the other hand, the main reason
for quarterly compounding may be to raise the effective annual interest rate.

So, there are two interest rates at work in this loan: the nominal rate (6 percent per year in
this example) and the effective annual interest rate that gives effect to the compounding of
the nominal rate. The effective annual interest rate on the loan in the example is 6.13636
percent, and is calculated as follows:
$6,136.36 interest for one year ÷ $100,000.00 borrowed at the start of year = 
6.13636 percent effective annual interest rate on loan
The true interest rate is the effective interest rate because this rate determines the actual
payment of interest. The nominal interest rate is simply the point of departure for calculat-
ing the effective interest rate.
If the business in this example had agreed to a 6.13636 percent annual interest rate on the
loan in the first place, the bank would have been willing to compound annually, which means
once a year. At this higher rate, the bank would have ended up with the same amount of
money. Essentially, the bank should be indifferent about whether it charges a 6.13636 percent
annual interest rate that is compounded annually, or a nominal 6 percent annual rate that is
compounded quarterly. It’s six of one, or a half dozen of the other.
Is it misleading to quote a nominal annual interest rate of 6 percent that in fact is compounded
quarterly? The effective or “real” annual interest rate isn’t 6 percent, but 6.13636 percent. You
could argue that compounding is a sleight of hand trick for jacking up the true annual interest
rate. Financial institutions have to be careful to abide with federal and state laws for truth in
lending in this regard. But these laws still leave lenders a fair amount of wiggle room in adver-
tising interest rates. All I can do is to caution you that featuring nominal annual interest rates
is common practice. If you’re loan-shopping, be sure to find out whether the nominal annual
interest rate is compounded more frequently than once a year.
263
Chapter 12: Figuring Out Interest and Return on Investment
Suppose the business doesn’t want to pay interest quarterly; it prefers to make just one 
payment at the maturity date of the loan one year later. The bank readily agrees as long as
the compounding effect is included in the payoff amount (maturity value) of the loan. The
bank demands quarterly compounding, which means there are four interest periods during
the year.
Q.
Assuming quarterly compounding of the
quoted 6 percent annual interest rate,
determine the amount the business has to
pay the bank at the maturity date of the
note one year from now.
A.
The 6 percent annual interest rate quoted
by the bank is often referred to as the nom-
inal rate. Nominal means in name only. In
the example, the lender insists on quar-
terly compounding, which means that it
charges a 1.5 percent rate each quarter. If
the business doesn’t pay interest at the
end of each quarter, the unpaid interest is
added into the loan balance for the next
quarter.
Accordingly, the amount owed to the bank
one year later is calculated as follows:
The business owes the bank $106,136.36 
at the maturity date of the note. Therefore,
interest on the note is $6,136.36, which is
$136.36 higher than the $6,000.00 simple
interest the bank would have charged if the
entire year had been treated as just one
interest period.

Discounting loans
Banks (and other lenders) make loans to businesses on the discount basis. The business signs
a note to the lender that calls for a certain amount, say $100,000, to be paid at the maturity
date of the loan. But the note contains no mention of an interest rate and there is no mention
of how much money the business receives. To determine the amount loaned to the business,
the lender discounts the maturity value of the loan by deducting a certain amount from the
maturity value. The difference between the maturity value and the amount loaned to the
business is the interest.

265

Q.
A business signs a note to its bank that
calls for $100,000.00 to be paid on the
maturity date one year later. The bank
deposits $93,295.85 in the company’s
checking account on the day the note is
signed. The note doesn’t refer to an inter-
est rate. Determine the effective annual
interest rate on this loan and the nominal
annual interest rate assuming that interest
is compounded quarterly.
A.
A problem like this isn’t that technical.
Nevertheless, the calculations required to
solve the problem are demanding. I recom-
mend using a hand-held business/financial
calculator to get an accurate answer. Here
are step-by-step instructions for using a
hand-held calculator to answer this problem:
1. Select the TVM (time value of money)
function.
2. To find the effective annual interest rate
on the loan enter 1 for N, which is the
number of periods (one year).
3. Enter $93,295.85 for the PV (present
value).
4. Enter $100,000.00 as a negative number
for the FV (future value); this amount is
negative because it has to be paid out to
the bank at maturity.
5. Press the INT (interest) key for the
answer, which should be 7.19 percent
(rounded). (On Hewlett-Packard calcula-
tors, this key is labeled I/YR, which
stands for interest per year, but it really
means interest per period.)
6. After finding the effective annual interest
rate, keep the same values in the regis-
ters for PV and FV, but enter 4 for N, the
number of interest periods (the number
of compounding periods). Then hit the
INT key, and you get the quarterly inter-
est rate, which should be 1.75 percent.
You multiply this percentage by 4 to get
the nominal annual interest rate, which
is 7 percent.
You can also use the RATE function in the financial set of functions in Excel to solve for
the effective and nominal interest rates for this problem.

Lifting the Veil on Compound Interest
In the “Distinguishing nominal and effective interest rates” section earlier in this chapter, I
explain how quarterly compounding increases the effective annual interest rate compared
with the quoted nominal annual interest rate. In this and following sections, the effective
interest rate is taken for granted. Instead of focusing on what happens within one year, the
following discussion look at the effects of compounding over multiple years for investing and
borrowing examples.
Interest rates and you
In an old TV police show, the sergeant would remind his
officers as they were about to go out on the streets for
their shift: “Be careful out there.” When borrowing and
saving, I would offer you the same advice concerning
quoted interest rates and effective interest rates. For an
example, assume a lender quotes you a 6 percent annual
interest rate on your home mortgage loan. You make
monthly payments, so the actual interest rate is .5 per-
cent per month. This equals a 6.168 percent effective
interest rate on your mortgage. In contrast, if you save
money in your credit union and it pays 6 percent interest
that is compounded monthly, you do not earn 6 percent,
but rather 6.168 percent effective interest. If you had
$10,000 in your account at the start of the year your bal-
ance is not $10,600.00 at the end of the year, but rather
$10,616.80 — because of the monthly compounding
effect.
In quoting mortgage interest rates, most lenders refer to
the nominal annual rate (in this example, the 6 percent
annual interest rate). They do not mention the effective
annual interest rate, which takes into account the
monthly compounding effect. The credit union in which
you have a savings account probably advertises the
6.168 percent effective annual interest rate it pays on
savings accounts. In general, lenders refer to their nom-
inal annual interest rates, whereas institutions that want
to attract your savings refer to their effective annual
interest rates. But, you have to be careful out there and
make sure you know which rate is being referred to.
8.
Assume that your next paycheck will be
$2,000.00 (net of all withholdings).
Unfortunately, payday is two weeks off, so
you go to a storefront business that offers
to advance money on your next paycheck.
(These loan sharks — well, that may be too
harsh a term — loan you a certain amount
today against the amount of your next pay-
roll check.) The lender advances you
$1,960.78 against your next paycheck.
You’re desperate, so you take the money
and sign the note. Two weeks later, you
sign over your $2,000.00 paycheck to the
lender to pay off the loan. What is your
nominal annual interest rate on this loan?
(If you have time, you may also calculate
the effective annual interest rate on this
loan based on biweekly compounding, or
26 times per year.)
Solve It

Be careful: “compounding” in these longer-term contexts (which run 5,10, 20, or more years)
takes on a different emphasis. Compounding in these long range settings refers to the expo-
nential growth idea — that if something grows at a certain rate from year to year, over
enough years its size will end up being two or more times larger than what you started with.
For instance, if you start with a population of, say, 10,000 persons in a town and its popula-
tion grows 6 percent per year, its population will double to 20,000 in 12 years.
You just invested your $10,000 year-end bonus in a 401(k) plan (a qualified tax-deferred
retirement account). You don’t pay income tax on the $10,000 or on the earnings in your
retirement account until you withdraw money from the account sometime in the future. You
plan to retire in 20 years. Being conservative, you put the money in a savings account that
pays 5 percent annual effective interest. (The interest rate could change in the future, but
assume that the interest rate remains the same over all 20 years.)
267
Chapter 12: Figuring Out Interest and Return on Investment
Q.
Assuming that your retirement account
earns 5 percent annual interest for 20
years, what will be the balance in your
account when you retire in 20 years?
A.
In order to answer the question for the 20-
year lifespan of the investment, you need
to understand how year-to-year compound-
ing works. Compounding means that you
don’t withdraw your interest earnings each
year. Instead, you reinvest the annual earn-
ings. The result of compounding for, say,
the first four years is shown as follows:
The total amount of your earnings over the
first four years is $2,155.06. Someone may
think that, at 5 percent, you earn $500.00
each year on your $10,000.00 investment,
and over four years, you will have earned
$2,000.00. But as you can see in the sched-
ule, you earn $2,155.06. You reinvest 
your annual earnings, which means that,

invested in your retirement account.
Over 20 years, your retirement account 
balance grows to $26,532.98. This amount
assumes an annual 5 percent annual earn-
ings rate and assumes that the financial
institution you have your retirement
investment account with doesn’t go belly
up. (The FDIC may insure your account,
but that still doesn’t guarantee that you’ll
get all your earnings.) 
Your total amount of earnings over 20
years is $16,532.98 (the future value less
the $10,000.00 you started with). It may be
useful to think of your total earnings as fol-
lows: At $500.00 per year interest, based 
on your initial investment, you earned
$10,000.00 ($500.00 per year × 20 years =
$10,000.00). The other $6,532.98 of earnings
over the 20 years comes from compound-
ing (reinvesting) your earnings every year.
How did I get the answer? To prepare the
four-year schedule, I grabbed my trusty HP
calculator: I entered 20 for N, 5 for I/YR,
negative 10,000 for PV, and then I punched
the FV key to get the answer. (By the way,
be sure that the PMT [payment] key has
zero entered.)
Before computer spreadsheet programs and hand-held business/financial calculators came
along, you had to use a table look-up method to solve problems like this one. Some of the
biggest disadvantages of this method are that tables of future values and present values
don’t cover every situation, they’re clumsy to use, and they require you to do pencil and
paper calculations by hand. Surprisingly, many college accounting and finance textbooks still
include these tables. For the life of me, I don’t know why — it’s like teaching the Morse code
when everyone has a telephone.

Refer to the preceding example question,
the retirement savings account example in
which you invest $10,000 today and earn 5
percent annual interest (compounded
annually) for 20 years. That example
assumes that the 5 percent annual interest
remains the same over all years. Instead,
assume that you earn 4.5 percent annual
interest during the first ten years and 5.5
percent annual interest during the last ten
years. Are you better off in this situation?
Solve It
10. Suppose you just received your $25,000
year-end bonus. Instead of buying a new car,
you decide to put the entire $25,000 in a
qualified tax-deferred retirement investment
account. You’re 55 years old and plan to
retire when you’re 65 years old. You’ve done
some research and have come up with two
options for where to put your money: One is
a safe, conservative investment vehicle that
should earn an annual 4.5 percent interest
rate (compounded annually), and the other
is a more risky investment that has a good
chance of being worth $45,000 ten years
later, but there’s some chance that it could
be worth less than this amount. Compare
your two options.

Borrowing and Investing in Installments 
Borrowing and investing are most commonly done in installments. With this method, pay-
ments are made regularly to pay off a loan or to build an investment. In this section, I stick
with interest-based investments and examples of fixed income investments and loans. (In the
section “Measuring Return on Investment (ROI)” later in the chapter, I cover investments in
which changes in the market value of the investment are an important part of the return
[earnings or loss] on the investment.)
Paying off a loan
Your business borrows $100,000 from a bank. You and the bank negotiate an installment loan
in which you will pay off the loan over four years. The effective annual interest rate is 6 per-
cent. The bank wants your business to amortize one-fourth of the principal amount each
year. Amortize means to pay down the principal value of the loan. At the end of the first year,
for instance, your business has to pay $25,000 on the principal balance of the loan plus inter-
est for that year, and so on for the following three years. You sign the note to the bank and
receive $100,000, which is deposited in your business’s checking account.

Q.
How much is each annual payment to the
bank?
A.
Probably the best approach to answering
this question is to prepare an Excel spread-
sheet to do the year-by-year calculations.
(Of course you could do the calculations
with pencil and paper by hand, but the
Excel program is much faster and less
prone to calculation mistakes.) The loan
payment schedule is as follows:

Q.
Using the basic premise of the preceding
question, suppose the bank wants equal
payments at the end of each year. (In the
preceding answer, the total payment varies
year to year.) What is the annual payment
on the loan under these terms?
A.
A question like this shows the value of a
hand-held business/financial calculator,
which is designed for the express purpose
of solving problems like this one. You enter
4 for N (the number of periods); 6 in INT
(the I/YR key on HP calculators); 100,000 in
PV (the present value of the loan, or the
amount borrowed); and 0 in FV (future
value). The reason for entering 0 in FV is
that you want the loan completely paid 
off and reduced to a zero balance at the
end of the fourth year. Press the PMT 
(payment) key, and the answer pops up on
the screen — $28,859.15. Each payment to
the bank should be $28,859.15.
The following schedule shows the proof of
this answer. Compared with the schedule
in the answer to the preceding question
note that the annual payments are equal in
this schedule:
You can see that the principal balance
reduces to zero at the end of the fourth
quarter. In this schedule, as the amount of
interest goes down each quarter, the
amount of principal amortization goes up.

Investing in a retirement account
Many people invest in tax-deferred retirement accounts on the installment, or serial basis.
They put some money in their retirement accounts at the end of each pay period, and their
employers may or may not make matching payments. The federal income tax law encourages
setting aside money from wages and other sources of steady income to build up a retirement
fund, such as a 401(k), IRA, and many other plans.
Assume that your employer encourages employees to invest money from their monthly
salaries in retirement accounts, and you’ve decided to do so. Each month, you put $250 into
your retirement account, and your employer adds $150, so $400 is invested each month.

271
Chapter 12: Figuring Out Interest and Return on Investment
13. Each month, you put $250 into your retire-
ment account, and your employer matches
$150, so $400 is invested each month.
Looking ahead, you wonder how much
your retirement account will be worth
when you retire in 20 years. You assume
that your annual rate of income will be 5.4
percent over the next 20 years. Determine
the future value of your retirement account
20 years from now.
Solve It
14. Assume that your goal is to retire 20 years
from today with $500,000 in your retire-
ment account. At this time, you have
$50,000 in your retirement account. You
would like to know how much you need to
put into your retirement account each year
from now until retirement to meet your
goal, assuming that your retirement invest-
ment account will earn 6 percent interest
per year. Assume that you make one pay-
ment into your retirement account at the
end of each year (although in actual prac-
tice, it’s more likely that you make monthly
contributions during the course of the
year). Determine the annual contributions
you need to make into your retirement
account over the next 20 years to end up
with a $500,000 retirement nest egg.
Solve It
The balance in your retirement account after 20 years is $160,670. How do you know this
answer is correct? Does it pass the common sense test? You invest $4,800 per year for 20
years, which is a total investment of $96,000. If the answer is correct, you will earn more
than $64,000 income over the 20 years. Does this amount seem reasonable? Your intuition
isn’t particularly helpful here. To be reasonably certain that $160,670 is correct, you could
program an Excel spreadsheet to see how your retirement balance accumulates month by
month for 20 years. Or you could do the calculation a second time, to see if you come up
with the same answer. Frankly, there’s no easy way to prove the calculation is correct. I’m
99.9 percent sure that my answer here is correct, but if you come up with a different answer
please let me know as soon as possible!
Q.
To be conservative, assume that your
retirement account will earn 4.8 percent
income per year, compounded monthly
(because you make monthly contribu-
tions). Although you may increase your
monthly contributions in the future if your
salary increases, at the present time, you
can’t forecast an increase. So you assume
that $400 will be contributed into your
retirement account at the end of each
month. Determine the balance in your
retirement account at the end of 20 years.
A.
One way you can do this computation is 
to go to one of many Web sites that have
retirement calculators. You enter your
monthly contribution, the assumed rate of
income per period, the number of years,
and presto — the answer comes up on the
screen. You can also use a business/
financial calculator or the Excel spread-
sheet program. In Excel, the FV function
asks you to enter the same variables as 
a Web site retirement calculator and a 
business/financial calculator.

Measuring Return on Investment (ROI)
There are many kinds of investments — precious metals, real estate, farms and ranches, art,
small businesses, corporate bonds, United States Treasury debt securities, municipal bonds,
life insurance policies, retirement annuities, stocks, mutual funds, hedge funds, and so on.
One thing all these different investment alternatives have in common is that the investor
wants to take more money out of the investment than the amount of money put into the
investment.
Measuring investment performance can be as simple as reading a comic strip or as perplex-
ing as reading a book on nuclear physics. The primary measure of investment performance is
the annual rate of return on investment, or ROI. “Return” in ROI refers to the earnings, income,
profit, or gain, depending on the type of investment.
A fundamental point in measuring investment performance is that you have to recover, or
recoup, the amount of capital you put in the investment venture. Only the excess over and
above recovery of capital is return on the investment. Another fundamental point is that cal-
culating return on investment focuses on cash flows into and out of the investment — unless
changes in the market value of the investment are an integral and important part of the
investment, such as investments in marketable securities (stocks and bonds, for example).
In just a few pages, I couldn’t possibly do justice to even one of the investment alternatives
open to you. Each type of investment requires at least a full chapter to explain its nature,
risks, and procedures. So in the remainder of this chapter, I focus on how to calculate ROI for
generic investment examples. I begin with a simple investment as far as calculating its ROI
goes. Then I move on to more complicated examples.
Example 1: Steady income flow; liquidation 
value equals entry cost
In this scenario, you invest $100,000 today, you receive $6,000 at the end of each year for four
years, and at the end of the fourth year, the investment is liquidated (converted back into
cash) for $100,000. This is about as simple an investment as you can find.
272
Part III: Managerial, Manufacturing, and Capital Accounting 
Q.
What is the annual rate of return on invest-
ment in this scenario?
A.
You can eyeball this example scenario 
and see that the annual ROI rate is 
6 percent. You don’t really need to do 
any calculations — the annual cash flow 
is $6,000, or 6 percent of the amount
invested. And you get your $100,000 entry
cost back in full — no more, no less — 
at the termination of the investment.
Because I’m using generic investment
examples, Figure 12-1 uses a generic tem-
plate to analyze this particular investment.

In Figure 12-1, turn your attention to the three columns under Cash Flow at End of Year. The
first column is the total cash flow for the period (one year, in this example); the second
column is for the earnings on the investment for the period (based on the ROI for the invest-
ment); and the third column is for capital recovery for the period. Capital recovery equals
the excess of the total cash flow over the amount earnings for the period. In the first three
years, capital recovery is zero because the cash flows equal earnings for the year. But in the
fourth and final year, the investment generates $106,000 total cash flow; the first $6,000 of
this is the amount of earnings for the year, and the remainder is capital recovery. The
$100,000 capital recovery in the final year exhausts the investment project; the investment
venture is completed at this point. The entry cost of the investment has been fully recov-
ered, and there are no more future cash flows.
The template presented in Figure 12-1 can handle just about every investment problem you
can think of — it’s a very powerful tool of analysis. You can alter it for any number of peri-
ods. I use four periods in these examples because that’s all I need to demonstrate the key
points for return on investment analysis. (Of course, an investment could run for 20 or more
years and therefore have many more periods.) In Examples 2, 3, 4, and 5, I present the solu-
tions using the Figure 12-1 template. The template offers one key advantage: It shows the
capital recovery and investment balance year-to-year.

A.
The annual rate of return on investment is

There’s $25,000 capital recovery every
year, so the investment balance decreases
year-to-year. This decrease may or may not
be attractive to you as an investor because
you recover your capital quicker, but you
earn less on the investment year-to-year.

Earnings are taken out of cash flow for the period first, before capital recovery is deter-

Earnings come first, and capital recovery is second.

You invest $100,000 today. The year-end cash flows from the investment are as follows:

275
Chapter 12: Figuring Out Interest and Return on Investment
Q.
What is the annual rate of return on invest-
ment for this scenario?
A.
The annual rate of return on investment is
8 percent. Check out the following sched-
ule, which uses the Figure 12-1 template.
Even though no cash flow is received in the
first three years, earnings are assigned to
each of the first three years at the rate of 8
percent per year. The negative numbers for
the first three years in the capital recovery
column mean that the imputed earnings
are, in effect, compounded or added into
the investment balance. For instance, at
the start of year 2, the investment balance
includes the amount of non-received earn-
ings for the first year.
This example brings out an exceedingly
important point: There’s no cash flow until
the end of the investment, so from a strict
cash flow point of view, you can argue 
that the annual earnings for the first three
years are zero. Then in the fourth year, 
the investment earns 36.05 percent ROI
($36,048.90 cash flow in excess of the entry
cost ÷ $100,000.00 entry cost = 36.05 per-
cent). In summary, you can make the case
that the annual ROI is as follows: year 1 =
0.0 percent; year 2 = 0.0 percent; year 3 =
0.0 percent; and, year 4 = 36.05 percent.
Well . . . you could argue this point of view,
but you’d be lonely because no one does it
this way.

In the world of finance, the ROI for Example 3 is measured at 8 percent per year. The stan-
dard method for determining the ROI on the investment assumes that the annual earnings
are theoretically received in cash but then immediately reinvested. Thus, you see the com-
pounding effect from year to year; the investment balance increases year-to-year by the
amount of reinvested earnings.
Don’t think that because the investment earns 8 percent ROI each year, you actually have
any cash flow from the investment. You don’t. In short, the 8 percent ROI solution is a con-
venient way to express the annual rate of growth in the value of the investment. It’s rather
arbitrary, but it’s the way things are done.

ment to get it started, and then at the 
end of the first and second years, you put
additional money in the investment. These
additional payments into the investment
are called negative cash flows.

Would you make this investment? You would have to pump $140,000 into the project before
you see any positive cash flow at the end of year 3. You may or may not be in a position to
do this. On the other hand, the investment yields 10 percent annual ROI, which is pretty
good. Generally, most investments involving negative cash flows are riskier and, therefore,
demand a higher than average ROI to justify taking on the risks.

Q.
How would most mutual funds advertise
ROI performance for the four years in this
example?
A.
Instead of presenting a year-by-year ROI
summary, which would show wild swings, a
mutual fund with the investment perform-
ance shown in the example would adver-
tise that it earned an average annual 8
percent ROI over the last four years.

ROI for Year
The mutual fund argues that the performance of the fund is equivalent to having invested
$100,000 and earning a level 8 percent annual ROI. Indeed, earning 8 percent per year causes
the investment to increase from $100,000.00 to $136,050.00 four years later, which is the
ending value of the investment (see the preceding schedule of returns). In other words, the
mutual fund says that if the investment had grown in value at a steady rate of 8 percent per
year, then the end result would be the same. This claim is true, as the following schedule
shows, but it certainly isn’t the whole story. Investors need to be informed about the wide
swings in ROI year to year.

Answers to Problems on Interest 
and Return on Investment
The following are the answers to the practice questions presented earlier in this chapter.
a
Suppose your company borrows $500,000 from a bank, and that amount is deposited in your
checking account today. The note that you sign calls for a 6.25 percent annual interest rate.
Determine the maturity value (the amount you will pay the bank when the note comes due then)
of the note one year from now.
$500,000 × 6.25 percent annual interest rate = $31,250 interest for year
$500,000 borrowed + $31,250 interest = $531,250 maturity value of note
b
Suppose you sign a note that calls for $868,000 to be paid to the lender one year from today. (In
other words, the maturity value of the loan one year from today is $868,000.) The lender gives
you $800,000 today in exchange for this note. There’s no mention of the rate of interest on this
loan. What is the annual interest rate on this loan?
$868,000 maturity value of note – $800,000 proceeds from loan = $68,000 interest on note
$68,000 interest ÷ $800,000 amount of loan = 8.5 percent annual interest rate
c
Refer to Question 1. Suppose the date on the note is March 1, 2006 — this is the date the note
was signed and the money was put in the company’s checking account with the bank. It’s now
August 31, 2006, which is the close of the company’s fiscal year. Should an adjusting entry for
interest expense be recorded? If so, make the journal entry.
Yes, an adjusting entry should be made to record the accrued interest — six months’ worth —
on the loan. The following adjusting entry should be made:
Interest Expense
$15,625
Accrued Interest Payable
$15,625
To record six months interest on note payable: $31,250 annual interest × 1⁄2 = $15,625 interest
through August 31, 2006.
d
Refer to Question 2. Because the note payable calls for a payment of $868,000 at the maturity
date, the bookkeeper thinks that this amount should be recorded as a liability and that the dif-
ference between this liability amount and the $800,000 proceeds received by the business
should be debited to the prepaid expenses asset account. Do you agree?
Accountants don’t agree with this recording practice. Of course, all notes payable have a matu-
rity value greater than the amount borrowed, but only the amount borrowed, equal to the face
value or principal of the loan, is recorded as a liability at the time of signing the loan. Then, as
time passes, an additional liability (accrued interest payable) is recorded for the accrued (accu-
mulated) interest on the loan. In a simple bookkeeping sense, recording the $68,000 interest on
the note as a prepaid expense and then crediting (decreasing) this account as interest expense
is recorded is fine, but interest isn’t really prepaid. Financial statement readers expect that the
balance in the prepaid expense asset account is, in fact, for expenses that have been prepaid.
e
Suppose a business borrows $100,000 for one year. The lender quotes a 6 percent annual inter-
est rate that’s compounded semi-annually (twice a year). Determine the annual effective inter-
est rate on the loan. You may find the following form helpful.
279
Chapter 12: Figuring Out Interest and Return on Investment

The annual effective interest rate is 6.09 percent, which can be seen in the following schedule:
At the end of the year, the loan balance is $106,09.00, so interest for the year is $6,090. Therefore,
$6,090 interest for year ÷ $100,000 amount borrowed = 6.09 percent effective annual 
interest rate
f
A company borrows $250,000 from its bank for one year. At the maturity date, one year after the
money’s deposited in the company’s checking account, it writes a check to the bank for
$268,324 to pay off the loan. Determine the effective annual interest rate and the nominal
annual interest rate assuming semiannual compounding.
$268,324 maturity value of note – $250,000 proceeds of note = $18,324 interest on note for 
one year
$18,324 interest ÷ $250,000 proceeds of note = 7.33 percent effective annual interest rate
Because the effective interest rate is 7.33 percent, the nominal annual interest rate is slightly
less — 7.2 percent, which means 3.6 percent per half year. The following schedule proves that
this rate is correct:
g
A business receives $235,648.98 today from its bank and signs a one-year note that has a matu-
rity value of $250,000.00. Determine the effective annual interest rate on this loan, and deter-
mine the nominal annual rate assuming semiannual compounding.
$250,000.00 maturity value of note – $235,648.98 proceeds of note = $14,351.02 interest on
note for one year
$14,351.02 interest ÷ $235,648.98 proceeds of note = 6.09 percent effective annual interest rate
Because the effective interest rate is 6.09 percent, the nominal annual interest rate is slightly
less — 6 percent, which means 3 percent per half year. The following schedule proves that this
rate is correct:
h
Assume that your next paycheck will be $2,000.00 (net of all withholdings). Unfortunately,
payday is two weeks off, so you go to a storefront business that offers to advance money on
your next paycheck. (These loan sharks — well, that may be too harsh a term — loan you a 
certain amount today against the amount of your next payroll check.) The lender advances you
$1,960.78 against your next paycheck. You’re desperate, so you take the money and sign the
note. Two weeks later, you sign over your $2,000.00 paycheck to the lender to pay off the loan.
What is your nominal annual interest rate on this loan? (If you have time, you may also calcu-
late the effective annual interest rate on this loan based on biweekly compounding, or 26 times
per year.)

Part III: Managerial, Manufacturing, and Capital Accounting 

$2,000.00 maturity value of advance – $1,960.78 = $39.22 interest for two weeks
$39.22 interest ÷ $1,960.78 advance = 2 percent interest for two weeks
2 percent interest for two weeks × 26 = 52 percent nominal interest rate for one year 
(52 weeks)
The effective annual interest rate is 67.3 percent, assuming biweekly compounding of the 52
percent nominal annual rate.
Keep in mind that getting an advance against your next payroll check involves other fees and
charges, so you pay more than just the $39.22 interest.
i
Refer to example question in the section “Lifting the Veil on Compound Interest,” the retirement
savings account example in which you invest $10,000 today and earn 5 percent annual interest
(compounded annually) for 20 years. That example assumes that the 5 percent annual interest
remains the same over all years. Instead, assume that you earn 4.5 percent annual interest
during the first ten years and 5.5 percent annual interest during the last ten years. Are you
better off in this situation?
The “trick” to answering this problem is doing it in two steps and carrying over the answer
from the first step to the second step.
For the first step, use your business/financial calculator to determine that $10,000.00 invested
for ten years at 4.5 percent annual interest accumulates to $15,529.69 at the end of the tenth
year (assuming compounding, or reinvesting of annual earnings).
For the second step, enter your answer from the first step as the starting amount (the PV, or
present value) for the second leg of the investment, which is ten years at 5.5 percent annual
interest. Your investment will accumulate to $26,526.96 at the end of this second ten years
(assuming compounding, or reinvesting of annual earnings.
You may be interested that the average annual interest rate that would take a $10,000.00 invest-
ment to $26,526.96 at the end of 20 years is 5 percent. But your actual investment balance
wouldn’t grow at this constant rate; rather, it would grow at the 4.5 percent and 5.5 percent
rates during the first and second ten-year segments of the investment.
j
Suppose you just received your $25,000 year-end bonus. Instead of buying a new car, you decide
to put the entire $25,000 in a qualified tax-deferred retirement investment account. You’re 55
years old and plan to retire when you’re 65 years old. You’ve done some research and have come
up with two options for where to put your money: One is a safe, conservative investment vehicle
that should earn an annual 4.5 percent interest rate (compounded annually), and the other is a
more risky investment that has a good chance of being worth $45,000 ten years later, but there’s
some chance that it could be worth less than this amount. Compare your two options.
The first thing to do is calculate the future value of your safe, conservative investment. Using a
business/financial calculator, $25,000 invested today that earns 4.5 percent for ten years will
grow to a balance of $38,824 at the end of the tenth year. The alternative investment may be
worth $45,000 at that time, which is considerably more than the conservative investment. You
have to assess the degree of risk that the alternative investment may be worth less than
$38,824. Of course, this kind of speculation is difficult.
k
Suppose a business borrows $1,000,000 from a bank. The annual interest rate is 7.5 percent and
the loan is for four years. The bank wants the business to make payments at the end of each
year such that the principal of the loan is amortized in four equal amounts. Determine the
annual payments required under the terms of this loan.
The following schedule shows the annual payments on the loan. I determined the annual amounts
by adding the interest on the loan for the year and $250,000, which is one-fourth of the amount
borrowed. A bank may or may not insist on equal principal reductions each year.
281
Chapter 12: Figuring Out Interest and Return on Investment

l
Suppose a business borrows $1,000,000 from a bank. The annual interest rate is 7.5 percent and
the loan is for four years. The bank wants the business to make equal payments at the end of
each year such that the principal of the loan is completely amortized (paid off) by the end of
the fourth year. Determine the amount of annual payment required under the terms of the loan.
The annual payments on the loan are $298,567.51. As you can see in the following schedule, the
loan is fully amortized (paid off) after the business makes the fourth payment. You can deter-
mine the annual payment on the loan by using a business/financial calculator or using the PMT
function in the financial functions in Excel. The important thing, however, is to make sure that
you understand how each payment is divided between interest and principal reduction.
m
Each month, you put $250 into your retirement account, and your employer matches $150, so
$400 is invested each month. Looking ahead, you wonder how much your retirement account
will be worth when you retire in 20 years. You assume that your annual rate of income will be
5.4 percent over the next 20 years. Determine the future value of your retirement account 20
years from now.
With a business/financial calculator or using the FV (future value) function in the financial func-
tions in Excel, you can determine that the future value of your retirement account based on
your assumptions will be $172,227.02.
One purpose of this question is to call your attention to how difficult it is to forecast the vari-
ables for such a relatively long period of time. The annual rate of earnings on your retirement
investment is almost certain to fluctuate; it’s unlikely that the earnings rate will remain con-
stant at exactly 5.4 percent every year for 20 years. Also, the monthly amounts you contribute
to your retirement account will probably increase over time. Nevertheless, making reasonable
forecasts and “running the numbers” is instructive to see the approximate value of your retire-
ment investment in 20 years. At least you have a ballpark figure to work with. Some retirement
plan mangers even make this sort of forecast for you.
n
Assume that your goal is to retire 20 years from today with $500,000 in your retirement
account. At this time, you have $50,000 in your retirement account. You would like to know how
much you need to put into your retirement account each year from now until retirement to
meet your goal, assuming that your retirement investment account will earn 6 percent interest
per year. Assume that you make one payment into your retirement account at the end of each
year (although in actual practice, it’s more likely that you make monthly contributions during
the course of the year). Determine the annual contributions you need to make into your retire-
ment account over the next 20 years to end up with a $500,000 retirement nest egg.
To work this problem, you need a business/finance calculator or Excel. The following answer
explains how to enter the data for this problem into a calculator.
You already have $50,000 in your retirement account (good for you!), which will be invested 
for 20 years. At a 6 percent annual ROI, the $50,000 will increase to $160,357, so you need 
to put more money into your retirement account to achieve your $500,000 retirement goal.

Specifically, you need to make annual contributions for 20 years that will accumulate to
$339,643 ($500,000 retirement goal – $160,357 future value of the $50,000 already in your 
retirement account = $339,643 additional future value needed).
To solve for this annual contribution amount with a calculator, do the following:
• Enter 0 in PV (present value); this amount is zero because you start this part of your retire-
ment account with nothing in it
• Enter 20 in N (the number of periods)
• Enter 6 in INT; this key assumes that you’re entering a percent, so the 6 is converted into 
6 percent
• Enter $339,643 in FV (future value); this is the amount of future value you want to accumulate
• Press the PMT (payment key), and $9,233 should appear on the screen
You need to make annual contributions of $9,233, or $769 per month.

You invest $1,000,000 today and receive $50,000 at the end of each year for four years. At the
end of the fourth year, you liquidate the investment for $1,000,000. Determine the annual ROI
for the investment, and prove your answer.
Perhaps you can figure the answer without doing calculations: $50,000 is 5 percent of $1,000,000,
so your annual ROI equals 5 percent. This ROI hinges on getting your full $1,000,000 back at the
maturity of the investment. To prove the answer, see the following schedule (which uses the tem-
plate provided in Figure 12-1):
p
You invested $250,000 four years ago. Unfortunately, you made a bad decision. At the end of
each year for four years, you received no income. But the good news is that you liquidated 
the investment for $250,000 at the end of the fourth year. Determine the annual ROI for the
investment.
As the following schedule shows, the annual ROI for this investment, I’m sorry to say, is zero
(0.0 percent):
q
You invest $100,000 today. You receive $29,656.22 at the end of each year for four years.
Determine the annual ROI on the investment, and prove your answer.
A series of equal amounts received or paid at equal intervals is called an annuity. In this sce-
nario, you have a four-year investment annuity. Business/financial calculators are designed to
solve problems like this. Enter 4 in N (number of periods), negative $100,000 in PV (present
value), 29,656.22 in PMT (payment per period), and 0 in FV (future value) because the future
value of the investment at the end of the investment is zero (there’s no liquidation value upon
termination of the investment). Press INT (or I/PR on a HP calculator), and you should see 
7.2 percent.

Your annual ROI on this investment is 7.2 percent, which the following schedule proves:
Each cash return (total amount received) includes an earnings component and a capital recov-
ery component. Therefore, your investment balance decreases year-to-year, causing the annual
amounts of your earnings to decrease year-to-year.

recover $250,000 capital each year. Determine the annual amounts of return for each year you
need to meet your objectives.
I used Excel to prepare the following schedule, which shows the annual amounts (returns)
needed each year to earn 6.5 percent on the amount invested at the start of the year and
recover $250,000 capital each year:
s
You invest $100,000 today. The year-end cash flows from the investment are as follows: 
year 1 = $0; year 2 = $0; year 3 = $0; and year 4 = $128,646.64. Determine the annual ROI for this
investment.
The answer is 6.5 percent annual ROI. I did this calculation on my business/financial calculator.
If you solve the problem with a calculator, be sure to enter 0 for PMT because you don’t receive
any annual cash returns — only the final cash out amount of $128,646.64. The 6.5 percent
annual ROI is the correct answer, as shown in the following schedule:
t
You invest $100,000 today. The year-end cash flows from the investment are as follows: year 1 =
$0; year 2 = $0; year 3 = $0; and year 4 = $90,368.79. Determine the annual ROI for this invest-
ment. Does this answer make sense?
Oops! Right away, you ought to see that the investment has a negative return — you lost money
on this investment. Do you really need to know the exact negative annual ROI? Well, if you do,
the annual negative ROI is 2.5 percent, as shown in the following schedule. Your investment bal-
ance decreases at the decline rate of 2.5 percent per year. (Normally, of course, you think of a
growth rate when discussing investments.)

You invest $100,000 today. The year-end cash flows from the investment are as follows: year 1 =
$10,000; year 2 = negative $15,000; year 3 = $20,000; and year 4 = $109,992. Determine the annual
ROI on this investment.
One way to solve this problem is to use the internal rate of return (IRR) function in Excel (it’s in
the financial set of functions). Many business/financial calculators include a similar function
that allows you to enter a series of unequal future returns (both negative and positive) and
solve for the internal rate of return. The IRR is simply the ROI rate that, when applied to the
entry cost and future returns from the investment, makes the total capital recovery over the life
of the investment equal to the entry cost.
In Excel, set up a schedule based on the Figure 12-1 template. Make an initial guess for IRR, and
see what the ending investment balance is at the end of the investment. If it’s positive, you
haven’t recovered all the capital, so lower the IRR. If the ending balance is negative, raise the
IRR. It only takes a few iterations to zero in on the exact IRR answer.
The IRR, or annual ROI, on this investment is 6 percent, which is shown in the following 
schedule:
v
You invest $100,000 today. The year-end cash flows from the investment are as follows: year 1 =
$25,000; year 2 = $48,000; year 3 = $75,000; and year 4 = negative $32,431. Determine the annual
ROI on this investment. Is there anything unusual about this investment?
The annual ROI, or IRR for this investment is 8 percent, as shown in the following schedule:
An unusual feature of this investment is the negative cash flow in the fourth and final year of
the investment project. You recover more capital than the entry cost by the end of the third
year. You need this over-recovery to provide for the negative cash flow in the final year. An
implicit assumption is that the investor can put this over-recovery in an investment that can
earn 8 percent. This assumption may or may not be true in an actual situation.
w
Look at the schedule of returns for Example 5. In this example, the average annual ROI is 
8 percent. Is this the average of the four annual rates of ROI (see the far right column in the
schedule)?
No, the average annualized ROI that you see referred to in advertisements and other material
on the historical performance of mutual funds and other investments isn’t equal to the average
of the four annual ROI rates.
In Example 5, the average of the four annual ROI rates is:
(15 percent – 19.1 percent + 46.8 percent – 0.3 percent) ÷ 4 = 10.6 percent average of the four
annual rates
The annualized ROI rate, which I explain in the section “Example 5: Market value-driven invest-
ments,” is 8 percent.

Chapter 12: Figuring Out Interest and Return on Investment

You invest $100,000 today. The annual ROI on the investment is: year 1 = 12 percent; year 2 =
negative 24.6 percent; year 3 = 33.7 percent; and year 4 = 29.6 percent. Determine the average
annual ROI on the investment.
A good way to find the answer is to first “run out” the investment to its terminal value, which is
the investment balance at the end of the fourth and final year, and then solve for the ROI rate
that would produce the same terminal value.
The investment’s value at the end of year 4 is $146,327. Solve for the ROI rate that would take
$100,000 to $146,327 in four years. This rate is very close to 10 percent, as the following sched-
ule shows:
There’s a small difference between the $146,410 ending investment value in this schedule and
the $146,327 ending balance, but as they say, it’s close enough for government work.

Part IV
The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
T
he Part of Tens contains two shorter chapters: 
one directed to business investors and the other to
accountants in carrying out their responsibilities to busi-
ness managers. The former presents ten things everyone
reading a business financial report should know and keep
in mind. The latter chapter provides accountants a ten-
point checklist for helping managers in their planning,
control, and decision-making. 

Chapter 13
Ten Things You Should Know About
Business Financial Statements
In This Chapter
 Recognizing the indispensability of financial statements 
 Being cool with estimates
 Living in multiple realities: Economic reality and cash flow reality
 Dressing statements for success
F
inancial statements, which are one of the main products of the accounting system of a
business, serve two broad purposes:
 They help managers manage the profit performance, cash flows, and financial condi-
tion of a business.
 They serve as a pipeline of information to business lenders and investors. Without this
financial information, lenders would balk at loaning money to a business and investors
would refuse to invest their hard-earned money in a business.
In short, financial statements are essential in managing a business and in raising the capital a
business needs to operate.
Internal financial statements used by managers don’t circulate outside the business if they
contain confidential and proprietary information. Internal financial statements are distrib-
uted on a need-to-know basis within the business; they contain more-detailed information
than the summary-level information presented in external financial statements distributed to
lenders and shareowners of a business. But both the internal and external financial state-
ments use the same accounting methods. Businesses keep only one set of books, but they
“keep secrets” that aren’t disclosed in their external financial reports.
Business managers, business lenders, and business investors should understand certain
characteristics and limitations of financial statements. I explain ten of these important points
in this chapter.
Rules and Standards Matter
I have seen very, very few maverick financial statements. Almost all financial statements are
prepared using generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and/or international
accounting standards. Financial statement readers can assume that American GAAP or the
international equivalent have been applied in preparing the financial statements and that

there aren’t any significant deviations from these rules of the game. If financial statements
are prepared on some other basis of accounting, the business should make this fact very
clear in its financial report.
These accounting rules and standards don’t put a business in an accounting straitjacket. 
A business still has wiggle room in the application of GAAP. For instance, both accelerated
and straight-line depreciation expense methods are equally acceptable (see Chapter 9), 
and a business can adopt either conservative or liberal (aggressive) accounting methods for
recording profit, which also affect the values reported for assets and liabilities in its balance
sheet. A business has the choice among alternative methods in many areas of accounting.
Exactitude Would Be Nice, 
but Estimates Are Key
Looking at all the numbers in a financial statement, you may assume that they’re accurate
down to the last dollar. Not true. The balance in the cash account is exact, but virtually 
every other number you see in a financial report is based on an estimate. The amounts of
expenses, revenue, assets, and liabilities are calculated down to the last dollar, but they’re
based on estimates, and estimates never turn out to be accurate down to the last dollar.
For example, consider depreciation expense. A business estimates the future useful life of a
fixed asset (long-term operating asset) and allocates its cost over this useful life. Another
example is accounts receivable — the business estimates how much of the total balance of
its accounts receivable will turn out to be bad debts. Yet another example is the accrued lia-
bility for product warranty and guarantee costs that will be paid in the future. This amount is
only an educated guess.
Estimates are unavoidable in accounting. Most businesses have enough experience to make
pretty good estimates, and they consult experts when they need to. A business can nudge an
estimate toward the conservative side or the liberal side. For instance, it can estimate that
its future product warranty and guarantee costs will be fairly low or fairly high. Usually, argu-
ments exist on both sides, and the business ends up having to make a somewhat arbitrary
estimate.
Some estimates are particularly difficult to make, such as the liability for future post-
retirement medical and health benefits that a business promises its employees. Another dif-
ficult estimate concerns product recalls. Estimating the cost of a major lawsuit in which the
decision may go against the business is very difficult. My advice is to be alert in reading
financial statements to see if the business is facing any issue that’s particularly difficult to
estimate.
Financial Statements Fit 
Together Hand in Glove
The three primary financial statements — the income statement, the balance sheet, and the
statement of cash flows — appear on separate pages in a financial report and therefore may
seem freestanding. In fact, the three financial statements are intertwined and interconnected
(see Chapters 7 and 8). Accountants assume that the reader understands these connections,
so they don’t connect the dots between corresponding accounts in different financial state-
ments. Understanding these tentacles of connection between the statements is extremely
290
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

important, especially for interpreting the statement of cash flows (see Chapter 8). For exam-
ple, an increase in accounts receivable during the year that’s reported in the balance sheet
causes a decrease in cash flow from operating activities.
For help in understanding financial statements and how all their elements work together,
check out my book How To Read A Financial Report (Wiley), which has been in print for
more than 25 years. The book clarifies the lines of connection between sales revenue and
expenses in the income statement and the assets and liabilities in the balance sheet that are
changed by sales revenue and expenses. Profit activities are reported in the income state-
ment, but the results of profit are reported in the balance sheet. I explain why accrual basis
profit differs from the cash flow from profit (operating activities) — which is a key point
that business managers and investors should understand, but many don’t. I use financial
statement example templates that can be adapted to fit most businesses. I offer to send
readers the Excel spreadsheets for the exhibits in my book. To date, I’ve received hundreds
and hundreds of requests for the spreadsheets. Hands down, the most frequent comment in
the e-mails I receive is that I make clear the lines of connection between accounts in the
financial statements.
Accrual Basis Is Used to Record 
Profit, Assets, and Liabilities
The vast majority of businesses must use the accrual basis of accounting to determine profit 
or loss and to keep track of their assets and liabilities. Simply put, the accrual basis must be
used to reflect economic reality. The following are three examples of the accrual basis at work:
 A business makes a sale on credit, accepting the customer’s promise to pay at a later
date and delivering the product. The accountant records the sale by an increase to an
asset called accounts receivable.
 A business buys a building or machine that will be used many years in its operations
and pays cash for the asset. The cost of the asset isn’t charged to expense right away.
Rather, the cost is allocated to expense over the estimated useful life span of the asset.
 A business records an expense now even though it will not pay for the expense until
sometime later. To record the expense, a liability is increased; later, when the expense
is paid, the liability is decreased.
Some small businesses don’t sell on credit, don’t carry inventory, don’t invest in fixed assets
(long-term operating resources), and pay their bills quickly. They may use the cash basis of
accounting instead of the accrual basis. Basically, all they do is keep a checkbook.
Cash Flow Differs from Accrual Basis Profit
The accrual basis of accounting (see the preceding section), even though it reflects eco-
nomic reality, causes one point of confusion: Many people look at the bottom-line profit or
loss number in the income statement and jump to the conclusion that it’s the amount that
cash increased or decreased for the period. Indeed, the expression “a business makes
money” suggests that making a profit increases the business’s cash account the same
amount. But cash flow from profit — the net increase or decrease in cash from the sales and
expense activities of a business for a period — almost always differs from the amount of
bottom-line profit or loss reported in its income statement.
291
Chapter 13: Ten Things You Should Know About Business Financial Statements

In one sense, you can blame accounting for speaking with a forked tongue: The income state-
ment reports one number for profit (net income), and the statement of cash flows reports
another number for profit (cash flow from operating activities). There’s the accrual basis
number in the income statement and the cash basis number in the statement of cash flows.
Essentially, a financial report has two versions of profit.
The amount of cash flow from profit (operating activities) in the statement of cash flows tells
you what profit would have been on the cash basis of accounting. The statement of cash
flows explains why the cash flow from profit is different from the net income for the period.
The main (but not only) difference between cash basis and accrual basis profit accounting is
depreciation. On the accrual basis, depreciation expense is deducted from sales revenue to
determine profit, which is correct of course. From the cash flow point of view, in contrast,
depreciation isn’t bad but good. The cash inflow from sales revenue, in part, reimburses the
business for using its fixed assets. In other words, depreciation for the year is recovery of the
cash invested in fixed assets in prior years. Money is returning to the business.
Profit and Balance Sheet Values Can Be 
and Often Are Manipulated
I’m sure you’ve heard about business managers “massaging the numbers” to make profit for
the year look better or to make the financial condition of the business look better. (My father-
in-law calls this “fluffing the pillows.”) Managers can and do lay a heavy hand on the account-
ing process — to pump up sales revenue or to deflate expenses for the year in order to meet
pre-established profit goals or to dampen the volatility of reported earnings year to year.
There’s no end to the tactics for manipulating accounting numbers.
Rather than presenting a litany of the techniques for massaging the numbers, I offer two
observations:
 Massaging the numbers is expected, and one may even argue that business lenders and
investors encourage it — mainly on the grounds that a business is entitled to put its
best face forward. Independent CPA auditors go along with a reasonable amount of
accounting manipulation.
 There’s a big difference between massaging the numbers and cooking the books.
Cooking the books is the playful name for a serious crime, accounting fraud, in which
fictitious sales are recorded, expenses aren’t recorded, liabilities are hidden, or assets
are overstated. Accounting fraud is a felony (if one gets caught and convicted, that is).
Financial Statements May Be Revised 
Later to Correct Errors and Fraud
One ominous financial reporting development over the last decade bothers me a great deal:
An increasing number of businesses revise their financial statements after releasing them to
the public. I’m speaking about businesses whose securities are traded in public markets
(such as the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ). Private businesses don’t release their
financial reports to the public at large, so their financial reports probably aren’t revised and
restated as frequently as those of public businesses.
292
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

By their very nature, financial statements are tentative and conditional. One of the first
things you learn in studying accounting is the going concern assumption. The accountant
assumes the business will continue to operate for an indefinite period of time and isn’t plan-
ning to shut down and liquidate its assets. Financial statements are conditional — the condi-
tion being that business will continue to operate in a normal fashion. (If a business is in the
middle of bankruptcy proceedings, on the other hand, the accountant has to reckon the
chances of the business continuing in operations.)
It’s amazing to me that most financial report revisions are made to correct major accounting
errors and accounting fraud. How did these errors slip through the system in the first place?
Undoubtedly, the Enron scandal has made people more aware of the possibility of account-
ing fraud. But even before Enron happened, the pace of financial report revisions had accel-
erated. All you can do is to take any financial report with a grain of salt and keep in mind that
the financial statements may contain serious errors.
Some Asset Values Are Current, 
but Others May Be Old
The balance (amount) of an asset in a balance sheet is the result of the entries (increases
less decreases) recorded in the account. A balance sheet doesn’t disclose whether the
ending balance in an asset is from recent entries or from entries made years ago. How recent
an ending balance is depends on which asset you’re talking about and which accounting
method is used for the asset. For example, if a business uses the FIFO method for its cost of
goods sold expense, its inventories balance is from entries recorded recently. In contrast, if
the company uses the LIFO method, its inventories balance is from older entries. How much
older? Well, one major equipment manufacturer has been using LIFO for many years and part
of its inventories balance goes back more than 50 years.
The balance of property, plant, and equipment typically consists of fixed assets that have
been on the books for 5, 10, 20, or more years. You should never confuse the original costs in
this asset account with the current replacement value of the assets. On the other hand, the
accounts receivable balance is current, as is cash, of course.
The footnotes to the financial statements may include information on the current replace-
ment values of certain assets. For example, if a business uses LIFO and has a large gap
between the FIFO and the LIFO balances. In this situation, the business discloses an estimate
of the FIFO amount for its inventories.
Financial Statements Leave 
Interpretation to Readers
One guiding rule of financial reporting is to let the financial statements speak for themselves.
The financial statements and footnotes report the facts but don’t interpret what the facts
mean or what the facts portend. The assessment and forecast of a company’s financial per-
formance and condition are left for the readers to tackle.
293
Chapter 13: Ten Things You Should Know About Business Financial Statements

Having said that, I should quickly point out that the chief executive and other top-level offi-
cers of public companies include a good deal of commentary and their interpretations of the
company’s financial performance in annual financial reports. Indeed, it’s useful to carefully
read the Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section in a public company’s annual
financial report. But keep in mind that getting the top officers’ take is like asking the captain
of a ship how the voyage went when the passengers may have quite a different opinion.
Financial Statements Tell the Story of a
Business, Not Its Individual Shareowners
Financial statements tell the story of the business. How well or poorly individual investors in
the business have done isn’t information you can find in the financial statements. Some
shareowners in a business may have had their money invested in the business from day one,
whereas other original investors may have sold their shares. The business doesn’t record the
prices they received for the shares; in other words, dealings and transactions among share-
owners aren’t recorded or reported by the business. This activity is none of the business’s
business.
The owners’ equity accounts in a balance sheet report only the original amounts invested by
shareowners. What has happened since then in the trading of these ownership shares isn’t
captured in the financial statements — unless the business itself bought some of the shares
from its shareowners. You might find it very interesting to compare the current market price
of stock shares you own with the stockholders’ equity balances reported in the company’s
balance sheet. In a rough sort of way, this is like comparing the current market value of your
home with the cost you paid many years ago.

Chapter 14
A Ten-Point Checklist for 
Management Accountants
In This Chapter
 Designing accounting reports for managers
 Getting managers involved in accounting
 Thinking more like a manager than an accountant
 Keeping things safe and sound
I
n a business, accounting has several functions. The responsibilities of the chief account-
ant and the accounting department include the following:
 Complying with the manifold requirements of federal and state income taxes, state and
local sales taxes, property taxes, and payroll taxes.
 Designing and operating a system to capture, record, process, and store all relevant
documents and information about the financial activities of the business.
 Ensuring the integrity and reliability of the information system, and preventing fraud
from inside and outside the business (the latter being directed at the business).
 Preparing financial statements that are reported outside the business to its lenders and
shareowners. (If the business is a public company, the accountants are also responsi-
ble for preparing filings with the Security and Exchange Commission, or SEC.)
 Preparing financial statements and accounting reports for distribution to the busi-
ness’s managers for their planning, control, and decision-making needs.
The last function listed here is referred to as management or managerial accounting. It con-
cerns accounting’s role in helping business managers carry out their functions. This chapter
offers a ten-point checklist for accountants in fulfilling their functions for managers, some-
what like the checklist for pilots before take off. Accountants are saddled with the several
functions listed above, and under the pressures of time they may end up giving short shrift
to their duties to managers — which is understandable. However, the very continuance of
the business depends on accountants providing managers information they need to know for
making decisions and maintaining control. If managers don’t get what they need from their
accountants, the business could fail or spin out of control. In this sense, management
accounting functions are the most central — if the business fails, the other accounting func-
tions are beside the point.

Designing Internal Accounting Reports
In designing internal accounting reports for managers, the accountant should ask, “Who’s
entitled to know what?” Generally speaking, the board of directors, the chief executive offi-
cer, the president, and the chief operating officer are entitled to know anything and every-
thing. (This sweeping comment is subject to exceptions in business organizations that tightly
control the flow of financial information.) By virtue of their positions, the financial vice presi-
dent and chief accountant (often called the controller) have access to all financial informa-
tion about the business.
Other managers in a business have a limited scope of responsibility and authority. The
accountant should report to them the information they need to know, but no more. For exam-
ple, the vice-president of production receives a wide range of manufacturing information but
doesn’t receive sales and marketing information. The accountant should identify a particular
manager’s specific area of authority and responsibility in deciding the information content 
of accounting reports to that manager. The reporting of information to individual mangers
should follow the organizational structure of the business; this practice is called responsibil-
ity accounting.
From the accounting point of view, the organizational structure of a business consists of
profit centers and cost centers:
 A profit center could be a product line, or even a specific product model. For example,
a profit center for Apple Computer is its iPod line of products; another profit center is its
iTunes Music Center (where customers download audio and video files). Within each
broad product line, Apple has sub-profit centers. For example, each type of iPod is a sub-
profit center.
 A cost center is an organization unit that doesn’t directly generate sales revenue.
For example, the accounting department of a company is a cost center.
The accounting reports that go to the manager of a profit center should be oriented to the
profit performance of that organization unit. The accounting reports that go to a manager of a
cost center should be oriented to the cost performance of that organization unit.
Helping Managers Understand 
Their Accounting Reports
Most managers have limited accounting backgrounds; their backgrounds are usually in mar-
keting, engineering, law, human resources, and other fields. Not to sound critical, but most
business managers have their desires to learn accounting under control. Furthermore, they’re
very busy people with little time to spare. Yet accountants often act as if managers fully
understand the accounting reports they receive and have all the time in the world to read 
and digest the detailed information they contain. Accountants are dead-wrong on this point.
One of the main functions of the management accountant is to serve as the translator of
accounting jargon and reports to business managers — to take the technical terminology and
methods of accounting and put it all into terms that non-accounting managers can clearly
understand. Of course, being an author of accounting books for non-accountants, I may be
biased, but I believe that management accountants can perform a very valuable service by
improving their communication skills with non-accounting managers.

Involving Managers in Choosing 
Accounting Methods
Some business managers take charge of every aspect of the business, including choosing
accounting methods for their businesses. But many business managers are passive and defer
to their chief accountants regarding the accounting methods their businesses should use. 
In my opinion, the hands-off approach is a mistake. Chapter 9 explains three critical account-
ing issues for which a business has to choose between alternative accounting methods.
Ultimately, the chief executive officer of the business is responsible for these decisions, as 
he or she is responsible for all fundamental decisions of the business. But such accounting
decisions may not be on the radar screen of the chief executive.
In choosing accounting methods, the chief accountant shouldn’t allow managers to sit on the
sidelines and be spectators. The chief accountant shouldn’t select an accounting method
without the explicit approval and understanding of top-level managers. In particular, the
head accountant should explain the differences in profit and asset and liability values
between alternative accounting methods. The business’s accounting methods should reflect
its philosophy and strategies, so if the business is conservative in its policies and strategies,
it should use conservative accounting methods.
The chief accountant can find himself or herself between a rock and a hard place when 
top-level managers intervene in the normal accounting process. This interference may be
referred to as massaging the numbers, managing earnings, smoothing earnings, or good old-
fashioned accounting manipulation. If the accountant accedes to management pressure, he 
or she should make clear to the manager what the consequences will be the following year.
Generally speaking, there’s a compensatory effect, or trade-off, between years; pumping up
profit this year, for instance, causes profit deflation next year. Massaging the numbers pro-
duces a robbing Peter to pay Paul effect, and the accountant should make this very clear to
the manager.
Designing Profit Performance 
Reports for Managers
The accountant needs to read the mind of the manager in designing the layout and content of
reports to the manager. Ideally, the profit report should reflect the manager’s profit strategy
and tactics. For example, a manager of a profit center focuses on two main things — margin
and sales volume. Therefore, the profit report should emphasize those two key factors. It
sounds simple enough, but one impediment exists in designing internal profit reports for
managers based on management thinking.
In designing internal profit reports for managers, accountants too often follow the path of
least resistance. They use the format and content of the income statement reported outside
the business, but this won’t do. An external income statement conceals as much information
as it reveals. External income statements don’t disclose information about margins and sales
volumes for each profit center of the business.
The accountant has to break out of his or her external income statement mentality and
think in terms of what managers need to know for analyzing profit performance and making
profit decisions. My main advice on this point is straightforward: Listen to how the manager
297
Chapter 14: A Ten-Point Checklist for Management Accountants

explains his or her profit strategy, which is called the “business model.” Get inside the man-
ager’s head. Do your best to understand the mindset of the manager regarding how he or
she sees the formula for making profit. Listen carefully to which particular factors the man-
ager thinks are the most important drivers (determinants) of profit. Don’t try to remodel the
manager’s thinking into the accountant’s way of thinking. Don’t forget that the manager is
the boss — even though you might think the manager should go back and learn accounting.
In short, don’t try to educate the manager on accounting; let the manager educate you on
what he or she needs to know in order to make profit.
Designing Cash Flow Reports for Managers
The conventional statement of cash flows is far too technical and intimidating for most
managers to make sense of. What managers don’t understand, they don’t use. In my view,
accountants are too bound by their “debits and credits” thinking when it comes to the state-
ment of cash flows. The statement of cash flows is designed to reconcile changes in the 
balance sheet during the period with the amounts reported in the statement. But should
this function also be the purpose of reporting this financial statement to managers? I don’t
think so.
In mid-size and large businesses, the financial officers of the business manage cash flow.
Other managers don’t have any direct responsibility over cash flow — although their deci-
sions impact cash flow. Managers of profit and cost centers should have a basic understand-
ing of the cash flow impacts of their decisions. They don’t necessarily need cash flow
statements, but they need to know how their decisions impact cash flow.
The cash flow reports to managers of profit and cost centers should focus mainly on the key
factors that affect cash flow from operating activities (see Chapter 8). These internal manage-
ment reports should concentrate on changes in accounts receivable, inventory, and operat-
ing liabilities (accounts payable and accrued expenses payable). These are the main factors
for the difference between cash flow and profit that the managers of profit and cost centers
have control over and responsibility for.
Designing Management Control Reports
Management control is usually thought of as keeping a close watch on a thousand and one
details, anyone of which can spin out of control and cause problems. First and foremost,
however, management control means achieving objectives and keeping on course toward the
goals of the business. Management control covers a lot of ground — motivating employees,
working with suppliers, keeping customers satisfied, and so on. But there’s no doubt that
managers need control reports that include a lot of detail.
The trick in management control reports is to separate the wheat from the chaff. Being very
busy people, managers can’t afford to waste time on relatively insignificant problems. They
have to prioritize problems and deal with the issues that have the greatest effect on the busi-
ness. Therefore, the accountant should design management control reports that differentiate
significant problems from less serious problems. In control reports, the accountant should
use visual pointers to highlight serious problems. In other words, control reports shouldn’t
be flat, with all lines of information appearing to be equally important.
298
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Developing Models for Management 
Decision-Making Analysis
For decision-making purposes, business managers need a model of operating profit that, the-
oretically, fits on the back of an envelope. Here’s an example of such a compact profit model,
which I adapted from “Analysis method #1: Contribution margin minus fixed costs” in Chap-
ter 10:
(Unit Margin × Sales Volume) – Fixed Expenses = Operating Profit
Suppose the sales price is $100 and variable costs equal $65 per unit. Therefore, unit margin
is $35. Assume the business sells 100,000 units, so its total contribution margin for the period
is $3,500,000 ($35 unit margin × 100,000 units = $3,500,000 total contribution margin). Last,
assume its fixed expenses for the period equal $2,500,000. So its operating profit is $1,000,000
for the period.
The accountant should develop a condensed profit model, which is limited to the critical fac-
tors that tip profit one way or the other. This profit model helps the manager focus on the
key variables that drive profit behavior. For example, continuing with the example just men-
tioned, suppose the manager is contemplating cutting sales price 10 percent to boost sales
volume 20 percent. Using the profit model the manager can quickly do a before and after
comparison of the proposed sales price cut:
Before: ($35 unit margin × 100,000 units) – $2,500,000 fixed expenses = $1,000,000 
operating profit
After: ($25 unit margin × 120,000 units) – $2,500,000 = $500,000 operating profit
Giving up 10 percent of sales price for a 20 percent gain in sales volume may have intuitive
appeal, but this decision would cripple profit. Operating profit would drop from $1,000,000 to
only $500,000; the manager would give up $10, or 29 percent of the $35 margin per unit. The
sacrifice is too great in exchange for only 20 percent gain in sales volume.
Working Closely With Managers in Planning
One of the most important managerial functions has two parts: forecasting changes that 
will affect the business and planning the future of the business. This task includes plotting
the sales trajectory of the business, the need for additional capital, and shifts in size and
makeup of its workforce and other factors. The accountant should be involved in the plan-
ning process from the get-go. Otherwise, the accountant is at a disadvantage in preparing
budgets and financial projections. The better the accountant understands the planning
process, and the closer the accountant works with managers in developing plans, the more
useful the financial forecasts and budgets will be.
Establishing and Enforcing Internal Controls
Internal controls are the forms and procedures established in a business to deter and detect
errors and dishonesty (see Chapter 4). (Internal control certainly isn’t the most glamorous
accounting function in a business organization.) Even if everyone in the business and every-
one the business deals with are as honest as the day is long every day of the year, errors are
bound to happen.
299
Chapter 14: A Ten-Point Checklist for Management Accountants

Here’s a personal example: I recently started receiving retirement income from the organiza-
tion that manages my retirement investment account. I completed a rather lengthy form
giving the organization all the information it asked for, and being an accountant, I appreci-
ated that it needed all this information. No problem. But the organization made a data input
error, entering my wife’s year of birth as 1963 instead of 1936. This is called a transposition
error, and it’s a common error in accounting systems.
Every business should have internal control procedures in place to prevent, or at least to
quickly catch, this type of error. I caught the error because I’m an old auditor at heart. Well,
to be honest, I noticed that the amount of money I received was too low and knew something
was wrong. I called the error to the company’s attention, and it took 15 telephone calls and
over two months to get the error corrected! What bothered me is that the company didn’t
have internal control procedures in place to prevent or to quickly catch the error.
A business is the natural target of all sorts of dishonest schemes and scams by its employees
and managers, its customers, its vendors, and others. To minimize its exposure to losses
from embezzlement, pilfering, shoplifting, fraud, and burglary, the accountant should estab-
lish and enforce effective internal controls in the business. As my father-in-law once said,
“There’s a little bit of larceny in everyone’s heart.” Internal controls are an example of the
principle that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
Keeping Up-to-Date on Accounting, Financial
Reporting, and Tax Changes
Accountants are very busy people because they carry out many functions in a business. 
Like business mangers, they don’t have a lot of time to spare. One thing that gets short shrift
in a crowded schedule is keeping up with changes in accounting and financial reporting 
standards. However, it’s absolutely essential that accountants stay informed of the latest
changes. Accountants simply have to set aside time to read professional journals, peruse
Web sites, and keep alert regarding developments in accounting and financial reporting.
Things don’t stand still.
