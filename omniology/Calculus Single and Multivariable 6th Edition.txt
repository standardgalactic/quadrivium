PREFACE
Calculus is one of the greatest achievements of the human intellect. Inspired by problems in astronomy,
Newton and Leibniz developed the ideas of calculus 300 years ago. Since then, each century has demonstrated
the power of calculus to illuminate questions in mathematics, the physical sciences, engineering, and the
social and biological sciences.
Calculus has been so successful both because its central theme—change—is pivotal to an analysis of the
natural world and because of its extraordinary power to reduce complicated problems to simple procedures.
Therein lies the danger in teaching calculus: it is possible to teach the subject as nothing but procedures—
thereby losing sight of both the mathematics and of its practical value. This edition of Calculus continues
our effort to promote courses in which understanding and computation reinforce each other.
Mathematical Thinking Supported by Theory and Modeling
The ﬁrst stage in the development of mathematical thinking is the acquisition of a clear intuitive picture of the
central ideas. In the next stage, the student learns to reason with the intuitive ideas in plain English. After this
foundation has been laid, there is a choice of direction. All students beneﬁt from both theory and modeling,
but the balance may differ for different groups. Some students, such as mathematics majors, may prefer more
theory, while others may prefer more modeling. For instructors wishing to emphasize the connection between
calculus and other ﬁelds, the text includes:
• A variety of problems from the physical sciences and engineering.
• Examples from the biological sciences and economics.
• Models from the health sciences and of population growth.
• New problems on sustainability.
• New case studies on medicine by David E. Sloane, MD.
Origin of the Text
From the beginning, this textbook grew out of a community of mathematics instructors eager to ﬁnd effective
ways for students to learn calculus. This Sixth Edition of Calculus reﬂects the many voices of users at
research universities, four-year colleges, community colleges, and secondary schools. Their input and that of
our partner disciplines, engineering and the natural and social sciences, continue to shape our work.
Active Learning: Good Problems
As instructors ourselves, we know that interactive classrooms and well-crafted problems promote student
learning. Since its inception, the hallmark of our text has been its innovative and engaging problems. These
problems probe student understanding in ways often taken for granted. Praised for their creativity and variety,
the inﬂuence of these problems has extended far beyond the users of our textbook.
The Sixth Edition continues this tradition. Under our approach, which we called the “Rule of Four,”
ideas are presented graphically, numerically, symbolically, and verbally, thereby encouraging students with
a variety of learning styles to expand their knowledge. This edition expands the types of problems available:
• New Strengthen Your Understanding problems at the end of every section. These problems ask stu-
dents to reﬂect on what they have learned by deciding “What is wrong?” with a statement and to “Give
an example” of an idea.
• ConcepTests promote active learning in the classroom. These can be used with or without clickers
(personal response systems), and have been shown to dramatically improve student learning. Available
in a book or on the web at www.wiley.com/college/hughes-hallett.

Preface
• Class Worksheets allow instructors to engage students in individual or group class-work. Samples are
available in the Instructor’s Manual, and all are on the web at www.wiley.com/college/hughes-hallett.
• Updated Data and Models. For example, Section 11.7 follows the current debate on Peak Oil Produc-
tion, underscoring the importance of mathematics in understanding the world’s economic and social
problems.
• Projects at the end of each chapter provide opportunities for a sustained investigation, often using skills
from different parts of the course.
• Drill Exercises build student skill and conﬁdence.
• Online Problems available in WileyPLUS or WeBWorK, for example. Many problems are randomized,
providing students with expanded opportunities for practice with immediate feedback.
Symbolic Manipulation and Technology
To use calculus effectively, students need skill in both symbolic manipulation and the use of technology. The
balance between the two may vary, depending on the needs of the students and the wishes of the instructor.
The book is adaptable to many different combinations.
The book does not require any speciﬁc software or technology. It has been used with graphing calcula-
tors, graphing software, and computer algebra systems. Any technology with the ability to graph functions
and perform numerical integration will sufﬁce. Students are expected to use their own judgment to determine
where technology is useful.
Content
This content represents our vision of how calculus can be taught. It is ﬂexible enough to accommodate
individual course needs and requirements. Topics can easily be added or deleted, or the order changed.
Changes to the text in the Sixth Edition are in italics. In all chapters, many new problems were added
and others were updated.
Chapter 1: A Library of Functions
This chapter introduces all the elementary functions to be used in the book. Although the functions are
probably familiar, the graphical, numerical, verbal, and modeling approach to them may be new. We introduce
exponential functions at the earliest possible stage, since they are fundamental to the understanding of real-
world processes. The chapter concludes with a section on limits, allowing for a discussion of continuity at
a point and on an interval. The section on limits is ﬂexible enough to allow for a brief introduction before
derivatives or for a more extensive treatment.
Chapter 2: Key Concept: The Derivative
The purpose of this chapter is to give the student a practical understanding of the deﬁnition of the deriva-
tive and its interpretation as an instantaneous rate of change. The power rule is introduced; other rules are
introduced in Chapter 3.
Chapter 3: Short-Cuts to Differentiation
The derivatives of all the functions in Chapter 1 are introduced, as well as the rules for differentiating prod-
ucts; quotients; and composite, inverse, hyperbolic, and implicitly deﬁned functions.
Chapter 4: Using the Derivative
The aim of this chapter is to enable the student to use the derivative in solving problems, including opti-
mization, graphing, rates, parametric equations, and indeterminate forms. It is not necessary to cover all the
sections in this chapter.
To increase access to optimization, many sections of this chapter have been streamlined. Optimization
and Modeling are now in Section 4.3, followed by Families of Functions and Modeling in Section 4.4. Upper
and lower bounds have been moved to Section 4.2, and geometric optimization is now combined with Opti-
mization and Modeling. Section 4.8 on Parametric Equations is linked to Appendix D, allowing discussion
of velocity as a vector.

Preface
vii
Chapter 5: Key Concept: The Definite Integral
The purpose of this chapter is to give the student a practical understanding of the deﬁnite integral as a limit
of Riemann sums and to bring out the connection between the derivative and the deﬁnite integral in the
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
Section 5.3 now includes the application of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to the computation of
deﬁnite integrals. The use of integrals to ﬁnd averages is now in Section 5.4.
Chapter 6: Constructing Antiderivatives
This chapter focuses on going backward from a derivative to the original function, ﬁrst graphically and
numerically, then analytically. It introduces the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and the concept
of a differential equation.
Section 6.3 on Differential Equations and Motion contains the material from the former Section 6.5.
Chapter 7: Integration
This chapter includes several techniques of integration, including substitution, parts, partial fractions, and
trigonometric substitutions; others are included in the table of integrals. There are discussions of numerical
methods and of improper integrals.
Section 7.4 now includes the use of triangles to help students visualize a trigonometric substitution. The
two former sections on numerical methods have been combined into Section 7.5.
Chapter 8: Using the Definite Integral
This chapter emphasizes the idea of subdividing a quantity to produce Riemann sums which, in the limit,
yield a deﬁnite integral. It shows how the integral is used in geometry, physics, economics, and probability;
polar coordinates are introduced. It is not necessary to cover all the sections in this chapter.
Chapter 9: Sequences and Series
This chapter focuses on sequences, series of constants, and convergence. It includes the integral, ratio, com-
parison, limit comparison, and alternating series tests. It also introduces geometric series and general power
series, including their intervals of convergence.
Chapter 10: Approximating Functions
This chapter introduces Taylor Series and Fourier Series using the idea of approximating functions by simpler
functions.
Chapter 11: Differential Equations
This chapter introduces differential equations. The emphasis is on qualitative solutions, modeling, and inter-
pretation.
Section 11.7 on Logistic Models (formerly on population models) has been rewritten around the thought-
provoking predictions of peak oil production. This section encourages students to use the skills learned
earlier in the course to analyze a problem of global importance. Sections 11.10 and 11.11 on Second Order
Differential Equations are now on the web at www.wiley.com/college/hughes-hallett.
Chapter 12: Functions of Several Variables
This chapter introduces functions of many variables from several points of view, using surface graphs, con-
tour diagrams, and tables. We assume throughout that functions of two or more variables are deﬁned on
regions with piecewise smooth boundaries. We conclude with a section on continuity.
Chapter 13: A Fundamental Tool: Vectors
This chapter introduces vectors geometrically and algebraically and discusses the dot and cross product.

viii
Preface
Chapter 14: Differentiating Functions of Several Variables
Partial derivatives, directional derivatives, gradients, and local linearity are introduced. The chapter also
discusses higher order partial derivatives, quadratic Taylor approximations, and differentiability.
Chapter 15: Optimization
The ideas of the previous chapter are applied to optimization problems, both constrained and unconstrained.
Chapter 16: Integrating Functions of Several Variables
This chapter discusses double and triple integrals in Cartesian, polar, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates.
The former Section 16.7 has been moved to the new Chapter 21.
Chapter 17: Parameterization and Vector Fields
This chapter discusses parameterized curves and motion, vector ﬁelds and ﬂowlines.
The former Section 17.5 has been moved to the new Chapter 21.
Chapter 18: Line Integrals
This chapter introduces line integrals and shows how to calculate them using parameterizations. Conservative
ﬁelds, gradient ﬁelds, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for Line Integrals, and Green’s Theorem are
discussed.
Chapter 19: Flux Integrals and Divergence
This chapter introduces ﬂux integrals and shows how to calculate them over surface graphs, portions of
cylinders, and portions of spheres. The divergenceis introduced and its relationship to ﬂux integrals discussed
in the Divergence Theorem.
This new chapter combines Sections 19.1 and 19.2 with Sections 20.1 and 20.2 from the ﬁfth edition
Chapter 20: The Curl and Stokes’ Theorem
The purpose of this chapter is to give students a practical understanding of the curl and of Stokes’ Theorem
and to lay out the relationship between the theorems of vector calculus.
This chapter consists of Sections 20.3–20.5 from the ﬁfth edition.
Chapter 21: Parameters, Coordinates, and Integrals
This new chapter covers parameterized surfaces, the change of variable formula in a double or triple integral,
and ﬂux though a parameterized surface.
Appendices
There are appendices on roots, accuracy, and bounds; complex numbers; Newton’s Method; and determi-
nants.
Projects
There are new projects in Chapter 12: “Heathrow”; Chapter 19: “Solid Angle”; and Chapter 20: “Magnetic
ﬁeld generated by a current in a wire”.
Choice of Paths: Lean or Expanded
For those who prefer the lean topic list of earlier editions, we have kept clear the main conceptual paths. For
example,
• The Key Concept chapters on the derivative and the deﬁnite integral (Chapters 2 and 5) can be covered
at the outset of the course, right after Chapter 1.

Preface
ix
• Limits and Continuity (Sections 1.7 and 1.8) can be covered in depth before the introduction of the
derivative (Sections 2.1 and 2.2), or after.
• Approximating Functions Using Series (Chapter 10) can be covered before, or without, Chapter 9.
• In Chapter 4 (Using the Derivative), instructors can select freely from Sections 4.3–4.8.
• Chapter 8 (Using the Deﬁnite Integral) contains a wide range of applications. Instructors can select one
or two to do in detail.
Supplementary Materials and Additional Resources
Supplements for the instructor can be obtained online at the book companion site or by contacting your Wiley
representative. The following supplementary materials are available for this edition:
• Instructor’s Manual containing teaching tips, calculator programs, overhead transparency masters,
sample worksheets, and sample syllabi.
• Computerized Test Bank, comprised of nearly 7,000 questions, mostly algorithmically-generated,which
allows for multiple versions of a single test or quiz.
• Instructor’s Solution Manual with complete solutions to all problems.
• Student Solution Manual with complete solutions to half the odd-numbered problems.
• Additional Material, elaborating specially marked points in the text and password-protected electronic
versions of the instructor ancillaries, can be found on the web at www.wiley.com/college/hughes-hallett.
ConcepTests
ConcepTests, modeled on the pioneering work of Harvard physicist Eric Mazur, are questions designed to
promote active learning during class, particularly (but not exclusively) in large lectures. Our evaluation data
show students taught with ConcepTests outperformed students taught by traditional lecture methods 73%
versus 17% on conceptual questions, and 63% versus 54% on computational problems.
Faculty Resource Network
A peer-to-peer network of academic faculty dedicated to the effective use of technology in the classroom,
this group can help you apply innovative classroom techniques and implement speciﬁc software packages.

grading an exercise answer as wrong, GO problems show students precisely where they are making a
mistake.
• Animated applets, which can be used in class to present and explore key ideas graphically and dynamically—
especially useful for display of three-dimensional graphs in multivariable calculus.
• Algebra & Trigonometry Refresher material, which provide students with an opportunity to brush up on
material necessary to master Calculus, as well as to determine areas that require further review.
• Graphing Calculator Manual, to help students get the most out of their graphing calculators, and to show
how they can apply the numerical and graphing functions of their calculators to their study of calculus.

Preface

To Students: How to Learn from this Book
• This book may be different from other math textbooks that you have used, so it may be helpful to know
about some of the differences in advance. This book emphasizes at every stage the meaning (in practical,
graphical or numerical terms) of the symbols you are using. There is much less emphasis on “plug-and-
chug” and using formulas, and much more emphasis on the interpretation of these formulas than you
may expect. You will often be asked to explain your ideas in words or to explain an answer using graphs.
• The book contains the main ideas of calculus in plain English. Your success in using this book will
depend on your reading, questioning, and thinking hard about the ideas presented. Although you may
not have done this with other books, you should plan on reading the text in detail, not just the worked
examples.
• There are very few examples in the text that are exactly like the homework problems. This means that
you can’t just look at a homework problem and search for a similar–looking “worked out” example.
Success with the homework will come by grappling with the ideas of calculus.
• Many of the problems that we have included in the book are open-ended. This means that there may be
more than one approach and more than one solution, depending on your analysis. Many times, solving a
problem relies on common sense ideas that are not stated in the problem but which you will know from
everyday life.
• Some problems in this book assume that you have access to a graphing calculator or computer. There
are many situations where you may not be able to ﬁnd an exact solution to a problem, but you can use a
calculator or computer to get a reasonable approximation.
• This book attempts to give equal weight to four methods for describing functions: graphical (a picture),
numerical (a table of values) algebraic (a formula), and verbal. Sometimes you may ﬁnd it easier to
translate a problem given in one form into another. The best idea is to be ﬂexible about your approach:
if one way of looking at a problem doesn’t work, try another.
• Students using this book have found discussing these problems in small groups very helpful. There are a
great many problems which are not cut-and-dried; it can help to attack them with the other perspectives
your colleagues can provide. If group work is not feasible, see if your instructor can organize a discussion
session in which additional problems can be worked on.
• You are probably wondering what you’ll get from the book. The answer is, if you put in a solid effort,
you will get a real understanding of one of the most important accomplishments of the millennium—
calculus—as well as a real sense of the power of mathematics in the age of technology.

1.1
FUNCTIONS AND CHANGE
In mathematics, a function is used to represent the dependence of one quantity upon another.
Let’s look at an example. Syracuse, New York has the highest annual snowfall of any US city
because of the “lake effect” snow coming from cold Northwest winds blowing over nearby Lake
Erie. Lake effect snowfall has been heavier over the last few decades; some have suggested this is
due to the warming of Lake Erie by climate change. In December 2010, Syracuse got 66.9 inches
of snow in one 12 day period, all of it from lake effect snow. See Table 1.1.

You may not have thought of something so unpredictable as daily snowfall as being a function,
but it is a function of date, because each day gives rise to one snowfall total. There is no formula
for the daily snowfall (otherwise we would not need a weather bureau), but nevertheless the daily
snowfall in Syracuse does satisfy the deﬁnition of a function: Each date, t, has a unique snowfall,
S, associated with it.
We deﬁne a function as follows:
A function is a rule that takes certain numbers as inputs and assigns to each a deﬁnite output
number. The set of all input numbers is called the domain of the function and the set of
resulting output numbers is called the range of the function.
The input is called the independent variable and the output is called the dependent variable. In
the snowfall example, the domain is the set of December dates {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16}
and the range is the set of daily snowfalls {0.0, 0.1, 1.4, 1.9, 3.4, 5.0, 6.8, 9.3, 11.9, 12.2, 14.9}. We
call the function f and write S = f(t). Notice that a function may have identical outputs for differ-
ent inputs (December 11 and 12, for example).
Some quantities, such as date, are discrete, meaning they take only certain isolated values (dates
must be integers). Other quantities, such as time, are continuous as they can be any number. For a
continuous variable, domains and ranges are often written using interval notation:
The set of numbers t such that a ≤t ≤b is called a closed interval and written [a, b].
The set of numbers t such that a < t < b is called an open interval and written (a, b).
The Rule of Four: Tables, Graphs, Formulas, and Words
Functions can be represented by tables, graphs, formulas, and descriptions in words. For example,
the function giving the daily snowfall in Syracuse can be represented by the graph in Figure 1.1, as
well as by Table 1.1.

As another example of a function, consider the snow tree cricket. Surprisingly enough, all such
crickets chirp at essentially the same rate if they are at the same temperature. That means that the

1.1 FUNCTIONS AND CHANGE

chirp rate is a function of temperature. In other words, if we know the temperature, we can determine
the chirp rate. Even more surprisingly, the chirp rate, C, in chirps per minute, increases steadily with
the temperature, T , in degrees Fahrenheit, and can be computed by the formula
C = 4T −160
to a fair degree of accuracy. We write C = f(T ) to express the fact that we think of C as a function
of T and that we have named this function f. The graph of this function is in Figure 1.2.

Examples of Domain and Range
If the domain of a function is not speciﬁed, we usually take it to be the largest possible set of
real numbers. For example, we usually think of the domain of the function f(x) = x2 as all real
numbers. However, the domain of the function g(x) = 1/x is all real numbers except zero, since
we cannot divide by zero.
Sometimes we restrict the domain to be smaller than the largest possible set of real numbers.
For example, if the function f(x) = x2 is used to represent the area of a square of side x, we restrict
the domain to nonnegative values of x.
Example 1
The function C = f(T ) gives chirp rate as a function of temperature. We restrict this function to
temperatures for which the predicted chirp rate is positive, and up to the highest temperature ever
recorded at a weather station, 136◦F. What is the domain of this function f?
Solution
If we consider the equation
C = 4T −160
simply as a mathematical relationship between two variables C and T , any T value is possible.
However, if we think of it as a relationship between cricket chirps and temperature, then C cannot
be less than 0. Since C = 0 leads to 0 = 4T −160, and so T = 40◦F, we see that T cannot be less
than 40◦F. (See Figure 1.2.) In addition, we are told that the function is not deﬁned for temperatures
above 136◦. Thus, for the function C = f(T ) we have
Domain = All T values between 40◦F and 136◦F
= All T values with 40 ≤T ≤136
= [40, 136].
Example 2
Find the range of the function f, given the domain from Example 1. In other words, ﬁnd all possible
values of the chirp rate, C, in the equation C = f(T ).
Solution
Again, if we consider C = 4T −160 simply as a mathematical relationship, its range is all real C
values. However, when thinking of the meaning of C = f(T ) for crickets, we see that the function
predicts cricket chirps per minute between 0 (at T = 40◦F) and 384 (at T = 136◦F). Hence,
Range = All C values from 0 to 384
= All C values with 0 ≤C ≤384
= [0, 384].

Chapter One A LIBRARY OF FUNCTIONS
In using the temperature to predict the chirp rate, we thought of the temperature as the indepen-
dent variable and the chirp rate as the dependent variable. However, we could do this backward, and
calculate the temperature from the chirp rate. From this point of view, the temperature is dependent
on the chirp rate. Thus, which variable is dependent and which is independent may depend on your
viewpoint.
Linear Functions
The chirp-rate function, C = f(T ), is an example of a linear function. A function is linear if its
slope, or rate of change, is the same at every point. The rate of change of a function that is not linear
may vary from point to point.
Olympic and World Records
During the early years of the Olympics, the height of the men’s winning pole vault increased ap-
proximately 8 inches every four years. Table 1.2 shows that the height started at 130 inches in 1900,
and increased by the equivalent of 2 inches a year. So the height was a linear function of time from
1900 to 1912. If y is the winning height in inches and t is the number of years since 1900, we can
write
y = f(t) = 130 + 2t.
Since y = f(t) increases with t, we say that f is an increasing function. The coefﬁcient 2 tells us
the rate, in inches per year, at which the height increases.

This rate of increase is the slope of the line in Figure 1.3. The slope is given by the ratio
Slope = Rise

= 8
4 = 2 inches/year.
Calculating the slope (rise/run) using any other two points on the line gives the same value.
What about the constant 130? This represents the initial height in 1900, when t = 0. Geomet-
rically, 130 is the intercept on the vertical axis.

Figure 1.3: Olympic pole vault records
You may wonder whether the linear trend continues beyond 1912. Not surprisingly, it doesn’t
exactly. The formula y = 130+2t predicts that the height in the 2008 Olympics would be 346 inches
or 28 feet 10 inches, which is considerably higher than the actual value of 19 feet 6.65 inches. There
is clearly a danger in extrapolating too far from the given data. You should also observe that the data
in Table 1.2 is discrete, because it is given only at speciﬁc points (every four years). However, we
have treated the variable t as though it were continuous, because the function y = 130 + 2t makes

1.1 FUNCTIONS AND CHANGE
5
sense for all values of t. The graph in Figure 1.3 is of the continuous function because it is a solid
line, rather than four separate points representing the years in which the Olympics were held.
As the pole vault heights have increased over the years, the time to run the mile has decreased.
If y is the world record time to run the mile, in seconds, and t is the number of years since 1900,
then records show that, approximately,
y = g(t) = 260 −0.39t.
The 260 tells us that the world record was 260 seconds in 1900 (at t = 0). The slope, −0.39, tells
us that the world record decreased by about 0.39 seconds per year. We say that g is a decreasing
function.
Difference Quotients and Delta Notation
We use the symbol Δ (the Greek letter capital delta) to mean “change in,” so Δx means change in
x and Δy means change in y.
The slope of a linear function y = f(x) can be calculated from values of the function at two
points, given by x1 and x2, using the formula
m = Rise
Run = Δy
Δx = f(x2) −f(x1)
x2 −x1
.
The quantity (f(x2) −f(x1))/(x2 −x1) is called a difference quotient because it is the quotient of
two differences. (See Figure 1.4.) Since m = Δy/Δx, the units of m are y-units over x-units.

Families of Linear Functions
A linear function has the form
y = f(x) = b + mx.
Its graph is a line such that
• m is the slope, or rate of change of y with respect to x.
• b is the vertical intercept, or value of y when x is zero.
Notice that if the slope, m, is zero, we have y = b, a horizontal line.
To recognize that a table of x and y values comes from a linear function, y = b + mx, look
for differences in y-values that are constant for equally spaced x-values.
Formulas such as f(x) = b + mx, in which the constants m and b can take on various values,
give a family of functions. All the functions in a family share certain properties—in this case, all the

graphs are straight lines. The constants m and b are called parameters; their meaning is shown in
Figures 1.5 and 1.6. Notice that the greater the magnitude of m, the steeper the line.

Increasing versus Decreasing Functions
The terms increasing and decreasing can be applied to other functions, not just linear ones. See
Figure 1.7. In general,
A function f is increasing if the values of f(x) increase as x increases.
A function f is decreasing if the values of f(x) decrease as x increases.
The graph of an increasing function climbs as we move from left to right.
The graph of a decreasing function falls as we move from left to right.
A function f(x) is monotonic if it increases for all x or decreases for all x.

Proportionality
A common functional relationship occurs when one quantity is proportional to another. For exam-
ple, the area, A, of a circle is proportional to the square of the radius, r, because
A = f(r) = πr2.
We say y is (directly) proportional to x if there is a nonzero constant k such
that
y = kx.
This k is called the constant of proportionality.
We also say that one quantity is inversely proportional to another if one is proportional to the
reciprocal of the other. For example, the speed, v, at which you make a 50-mile trip is inversely
proportional to the time, t, taken, because v is proportional to 1/t:

Exponential growth
Suppose we divide each year’s population by the previous year’s population. For example,
Population in 2004
Population in 2003 = 13.290 million
12.853 million = 1.034
Population in 2005
Population in 2004 = 13.747 million
13.290 million = 1.034.
The fact that both calculations give 1.034 shows the population grew by about 3.4% between 2003
and 2004 and between 2004 and 2005. Similar calculations for other years show that the popula-
tion grew by a factor of about 1.034, or 3.4%, every year. Whenever we have a constant growth
factor (here 1.034), we have exponential growth. The population t years after 2003 is given by the
exponential function
P = 12.853(1.034)t.
If we assume that the formula holds for 50 years, the population graph has the shape shown in
Figure 1.17. Since the population is growing faster and faster as time goes on, the graph is bending
upward; we say it is concave up. Even exponential functions which climb slowly at ﬁrst, such as
this one, eventually climb extremely quickly.
To recognize that a table of t and P values comes from an exponential function, look for
ratios of P values that are constant for equally spaced t values.
Concavity
We have used the term concave up12 to describe the graph in Figure 1.17. In words:
The graph of a function is concave up if it bends upward as we move left to right; it is
concave down if it bends downward. (See Figure 1.18 for four possible shapes.) A line is
neither concave up nor concave down.

Elimination of a Drug from the Body
Now we look at a quantity which is decreasing exponentially instead of increasing. When a patient is
given medication, the drug enters the bloodstream. As the drug passes through the liver and kidneys,
it is metabolized and eliminated at a rate that depends on the particular drug. For the antibiotic
ampicillin, approximately 40% of the drug is eliminated every hour. A typical dose of ampicillin
is 250 mg. Suppose Q = f(t), where Q is the quantity of ampicillin, in mg, in the bloodstream at
time t hours since the drug was given. At t = 0, we have Q = 250. Since every hour the amount
remaining is 60% of the previous amount, we have
f(0) = 250
f(1) = 250(0.6)
f(2) = (250(0.6))(0.6) = 250(0.6)2,
and after t hours,
Q = f(t) = 250(0.6)t.
This is an exponential decay function. Some values of the function are in Table 1.9; its graph is in
Figure 1.19.
Notice the way in which the function in Figure 1.19 is decreasing. Each hour a smaller quantity
of the drug is removed than in the previous hour. This is because as time passes, there is less of the
drug in the body to be removed. Compare this to the exponential growth in Figure 1.17, where each
step upward is larger than the previous one. Notice, however, that both graphs are concave up.

The General Exponential Function
We say P is an exponential function of t with base a if
P = P0at,
where P0 is the initial quantity (when t = 0) and a is the factor by which P changes when t
increases by 1.
If a > 1, we have exponential growth; if 0 < a < 1, we have exponential decay.

14
Chapter One A LIBRARY OF FUNCTIONS
Provided a > 0, the largest possible domain for the exponential function is all real numbers. The
reason we do not want a ≤0 is that, for example, we cannot deﬁne a1/2 if a < 0. Also, we do not
usually have a = 1, since P = P01t = P0 is then a constant function.
The value of a is closely related to the percent growth (or decay) rate. For example, if a = 1.03,
then P is growing at 3%; if a = 0.94, then P is decaying at 6%.
Example 1
Suppose that Q = f(t) is an exponential function of t. If f(20) = 88.2 and f(23) = 91.4:
(a)
Find the base.
(b)
Find the growth rate.
(c)
Evaluate f(25).
Solution
(a) Let
Q = Q0at.
Substituting t = 20, Q = 88.2 and t = 23, Q = 91.4 gives two equations for Q0 and a:
88.2 = Q0a20
and
91.4 = Q0a23.
Dividing the two equations enables us to eliminate Q0:
91.4
88.2 = Q0a23
Q0a20 = a3.
Solving for the base, a, gives
a =
91.4
88.2
1/3
= 1.012.
(b) Since a = 1.012, the growth rate is 0.012 = 1.2%.
(c) We want to evaluate f(25) = Q0a25 = Q0(1.012)25. First we ﬁnd Q0 from the equation
88.2 = Q0(1.012)20.
Solving gives Q0 = 69.5. Thus,
f(25) = 69.5(1.012)25 = 93.6.
Half-Life and Doubling Time
Radioactive substances, such as uranium, decay exponentially. A certain percentage of the mass
disintegrates in a given unit of time; the time it takes for half the mass to decay is called the half-life
of the substance.
A well-known radioactive substance is carbon-14, which is used to date organic objects. When
a piece of wood or bone was part of a living organism, it accumulated small amounts of radioactive
carbon-14. Once the organism dies, it no longer picks up carbon-14. Using the half-life of carbon-14
(about 5730 years), we can estimate the age of the object. We use the following deﬁnitions:
The half-life of an exponentially decaying quantity is the time required for the quantity to be
reduced by a factor of one half.
The doubling time of an exponentially increasing quantity is the time required for the quan-
tity to double.

1.2 EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS
15
The Family of Exponential Functions
The formula P = P0at gives a family of exponential functions with positive parameters P0 (the
initial quantity) and a (the base, or growth/decay factor). The base tells us whether the function is
increasing (a > 1) or decreasing (0 < a < 1). Since a is the factor by which P changes when
t is increased by 1, large values of a mean fast growth; values of a near 0 mean fast decay. (See
Figures 1.20 and 1.21.) All members of the family P = P0at are concave up.

six constants, a, b, c, d, p, q?
y = p · qx
y = c · dx
y = a · bx

y
Figure 1.22
Solution
All the constants are positive. Since a, c, p represent y-intercepts, we see that a = c because these
graphs intersect on the y-axis. In addition, a = c < p, since y = p · qx crosses the y-axis above the
other two.
Since y = a·bx is decreasing, we have 0 < b < 1. The other functions are increasing, so 1 < d
and 1 < q.
Exponential Functions with Base e
The most frequently used base for an exponential function is the famous number e = 2.71828 . . ..
This base is used so often that you will ﬁnd an ex button on most scientiﬁc calculators. At ﬁrst
glance, this is all somewhat mysterious. Why is it convenient to use the base 2.71828 . . .? The full
answer to that question must wait until Chapter 3, where we show that many calculus formulas come
out neatly when e is used as the base. We often use the following result:

16
Chapter One A LIBRARY OF FUNCTIONS
Any exponential growth function can be written, for some a > 1 and k > 0, in the form
P = P0at
or
P = P0ekt
and any exponential decay function can be written, for some 0 < a < 1 and −k < 0, as
Q = Q0at
or
Q = Q0e−kt,
where P0 and Q0 are the initial quantities.
We say that P and Q are growing or decaying at a continuous13 rate of k. (For exam-

Figure 1.24: An exponential decay function
Solution
We have
P = e0.5t = (e0.5)t = (1.65)t.
Thus, P is an exponential growth function with P0 = 1 and a = 1.65. The function is increasing
and its graph is concave up, similar to those in Figure 1.20. Also,
Q = 5e−0.2t = 5(e−0.2)t = 5(0.819)t,
so Q is an exponential decay function with Q0 = 5 and a = 0.819. The function is decreasing and
its graph is concave up, similar to those in Figure 1.21.
Example 4
The quantity, Q, of a drug in a patient’s body at time t is represented for positive constants S and
k by the function Q = S(1 −e−kt). For t ≥0, describe how Q changes with time. What does S
represent?
Solution
The graph of Q is shown in Figure 1.25. Initially none of the drug is present, but the quantity
increases with time. Since the graph is concave down, the quantity increases at a decreasing rate.
This is realistic because as the quantity of the drug in the body increases, so does the rate at which
the body excretes the drug. Thus, we expect the quantity to level off. Figure 1.25 shows that S is the
saturation level. The line Q = S is called a horizontal asymptote.
13The reason that k is called the continuous rate is explored in detail in Chapter 11.

Shifts and Stretches
The graph of a constant multiple of a given function is easy to visualize: each y-value is stretched
or shrunk by that multiple. For example, consider the function f(x) and its multiples y = 3f(x)
and y = −2f(x). Their graphs are shown in Figure 1.31. The factor 3 in the function y = 3f(x)
stretches each f(x) value by multiplying it by 3; the factor −2 in the function y = −2f(x) stretches
f(x) by multiplying by 2 and reﬂects it about the x-axis. You can think of the multiples of a given
function as a family of functions.

Figure 1.32: Graphs of y = x2 with y = x2 + 4 and
y = (x −2)2
It is also easy to create families of functions by shifting graphs. For example, y −4 = x2 is the
same as y = x2 + 4, which is the graph of y = x2 shifted up by 4. Similarly, y = (x −2)2 is the
graph of y = x2 shifted right by 2. (See Figure 1.32.)
• Multiplying a function by a constant, c, stretches the graph vertically (if c > 1) or shrinks
the graph vertically (if 0 < c < 1). A negative sign (if c < 0) reﬂects the graph about the
x-axis, in addition to shrinking or stretching.
• Replacing y by (y −k) moves a graph up by k (down if k is negative).
• Replacing x by (x −h) moves a graph to the right by h (to the left if h is negative).
Composite Functions
If oil is spilled from a tanker, the area of the oil slick grows with time. Suppose that the oil slick is
always a perfect circle. Then the area, A, of the oil slick is a function of its radius, r:
A = f(r) = πr2.
The radius is also a function of time, because the radius increases as more oil spills. Thus, the area,
being a function of the radius, is also a function of time. If, for example, the radius is given by
r = g(t) = 1 + t,

22
Chapter One A LIBRARY OF FUNCTIONS
then the area is given as a function of time by substitution:
A = πr2 = π(1 + t)2.
We are thinking of A as a composite function or a “function of a function,” which is written
A = f(g(t))
  	
Composite function;
f is outside function,
g is inside function
= π(g(t))2 = π(1 + t)2.
To calculate A using the formula π(1 + t)2, the ﬁrst step is to ﬁnd 1 + t, and the second step is to
square and multiply by π. The ﬁrst step corresponds to the inside function g(t) = 1 + t, and the
second step corresponds to the outside function f(r) = πr2.
Example 1
If f(x) = x2 and g(x) = x −2, ﬁnd each of the following:
(a)
f(g(3))
(b)
g(f(3))
(c)
f(g(x))
(d)
g(f(x))
Solution
(a) Since g(3) = 1, we have f(g(3)) = f(1) = 1.
(b) Since f(3) = 9, we have g(f(3)) = g(9) = 7. Notice that f(g(3)) ̸= g(f(3)).
(c) f(g(x)) = f(x −2) = (x −2)2.
(d) g(f(x)) = g(x2) = x2 −2. Again, notice that f(g(x)) ̸= g(f(x)).
Notice that the horizontal shift in Figure 1.32 can be thought of as a composition f(g(x)) = (x−2)2.
Example 2
Express each of the following functions as a composition:
(a)
h(t) = (1 + t3)27 (b)
k(y) = e−y2
(c)
l(y) = −(ey)2
Solution
In each case think about how you would calculate a value of the function. The ﬁrst stage of the
calculation gives you the inside function, and the second stage gives you the outside function.
(a) For (1 + t3)27, the ﬁrst stage is cubing and adding 1, so an inside function is g(t) = 1 + t3. The
second stage is taking the 27th power, so an outside function is f(y) = y27. Then
f(g(t)) = f(1 + t3) = (1 + t3)27.
In fact, there are lots of different answers: g(t) = t3 and f(y) = (1+y)27 is another possibility.
(b) To calculate e−y2 we square y, take its negative, and then take e to that power. So if g(y) = −y2
and f(z) = ez, then we have
f(g(y)) = e−y2.
(c) To calculate −(ey)2, we ﬁnd ey, square it, and take the negative. Using the same deﬁnitions of
f and g as in part (b), the composition is
g(f(y)) = −(ey)2.
Since parts (b) and (c) give different answers, we see the order in which functions are composed
is important.
Odd and Even Functions: Symmetry
There is a certain symmetry apparent in the graphs of f(x) = x2 and g(x) = x3 in Figure 1.33. For
each point (x, x2) on the graph of f, the point (−x, x2) is also on the graph; for each point (x, x3)
on the graph of g, the point (−x, −x3) is also on the graph. The graph of f(x) = x2 is symmetric
about the y-axis, whereas the graph of g(x) = x3 is symmetric about the origin. The graph of any
polynomial involving only even powers of x has symmetry about the y-axis, while polynomials
with only odd powers of x are symmetric about the origin. Consequently, any functions with these
symmetry properties are called even and odd, respectively.

f is an odd function if f(−x) = −f(x) for all x.
For example, g(x) = ex2 is even and h(x) = x1/3 is odd. However, many functions do not
have any symmetry and are neither even nor odd.
Inverse Functions
On August 26, 2005, the runner Kenenisa Bekele17 of Ethiopia set a world record for the 10,000-
meter race. His times, in seconds, at 2000-meter intervals are recorded in Table 1.14, where t = f(d)
is the number of seconds Bekele took to complete the ﬁrst d meters of the race. For example, Bekele
ran the ﬁrst 4000 meters in 629.98 seconds, so f(4000) = 629.98. The function f was useful to
athletes planning to compete with Bekele.
Let us now change our point of view and ask for distances rather than times. If we ask how
far Bekele ran during the ﬁrst 629.98 seconds of his race, the answer is clearly 4000 meters. Going
backward in this way from numbers of seconds to numbers of meters gives f −1, the inverse func-
tion18 of f. We write f −1(629.98) = 4000. Thus, f −1(t) is the number of meters that Bekele ran
during the ﬁrst t seconds of his race. See Table 1.15, which contains values of f −1.
The independent variable for f is the dependent variable for f −1, and vice versa. The domains
and ranges of f and f −1 are also interchanged. The domain of f is all distances d such that 0 ≤
d ≤10000, which is the range of f −1. The range of f is all times t, such that 0 ≤t ≤1577.53,
which is the domain of f −1.

Which Functions Have Inverses?
If a function has an inverse, we say it is invertible. Let’s look at a function which is not invertible.
Consider the ﬂight of the Mercury spacecraft Freedom 7, which carried Alan Shepard, Jr. into space

in May 1961. Shepard was the ﬁrst American to journey into space. After launch, his spacecraft rose
to an altitude of 116 miles, and then came down into the sea. The function f(t) giving the altitude
in miles t minutes after lift-off does not have an inverse. To see why not, try to decide on a value for
f −1(100), which should be the time when the altitude of the spacecraft was 100 miles. However,
there are two such times, one when the spacecraft was ascending and one when it was descending.
(See Figure 1.34.)
The reason the altitude function does not have an inverse is that the altitude has the same value
for two different times. The reason the Bekele time function did have an inverse is that each running
time, t, corresponds to a unique distance, d.

Figure 1.35: A function which has an
inverse
Figure 1.35 suggests when an inverse exists. The original function, f, takes us from an x-value
to a y-value, as shown in Figure 1.35. Since having an inverse means there is a function going from
a y-value to an x-value, the crucial question is whether we can get back. In other words, does each
y-value correspond to a unique x-value? If so, there’s an inverse; if not, there is not. This principle
may be stated geometrically, as follows:
A function has an inverse if (and only if) its graph intersects any horizontal line at most once.
For example, the function f(x) = x2 does not have an inverse because many horizontal lines
intersect the parabola twice.
Definition of an Inverse Function
If the function f is invertible, its inverse is deﬁned as follows:
f −1(y) = x
means
y = f(x).
Formulas for Inverse Functions
If a function is deﬁned by a formula, it is sometimes possible to ﬁnd a formula for the inverse
function. In Section 1.1, we looked at the snow tree cricket, whose chirp rate, C, in chirps per
minute, is approximated at the temperature, T , in degrees Fahrenheit, by the formula
C = f(T ) = 4T −160.
So far we have used this formula to predict the chirp rate from the temperature. But it is also possible
to use this formula backward to calculate the temperature from the chirp rate.

1.3 NEW FUNCTIONS FROM OLD
25
Example 3
Find the formula for the function giving temperature in terms of the number of cricket chirps per
minute; that is, ﬁnd the inverse function f −1 such that
T = f −1(C).
Solution
Since C is an increasing function, f is invertible. We know C = 4T −160. We solve for T , giving
T = C
4 + 40,
so
f −1(C) = C
4 + 40.
Graphs of Inverse Functions
The function f(x) = x3 is increasing everywhere and so has an inverse. To ﬁnd the inverse, we
solve
y = x3
for x, giving
x = y1/3.
The inverse function is
f −1(y) = y1/3
or, if we want to call the independent variable x,
f −1(x) = x1/3.
The graphs of y = x3 and y = x1/3 are shown in Figure 1.36. Notice that these graphs are the
reﬂections of one another about the line y = x. For example, (8, 2) is on the graph of y = x1/3
because 2 = 81/3, and (2, 8) is on the graph of y = x3 because 8 = 23. The points (8, 2) and (2, 8)
are reﬂections of one another about the line y = x.
In general, we have the following result.
If the x- and y-axes have the same scales, the graph of f −1 is the reﬂec-
tion of the graph of f about the line y = x.

LOGARITHMIC FUNCTIONS
In Section 1.2, we approximated the population of Burkina Faso (in millions) by the function
P = f(t) = 12.853(1.034)t,
where t is the number of years since 2003. Now suppose that instead of calculating the population
at time t, we ask when the population will reach 20 million. We want to ﬁnd the value of t for which
20 = f(t) = 12.853(1.034)t.
We use logarithms to solve for a variable in an exponent.
Logarithms to Base 10 and to Base e
We deﬁne the logarithm function, log10 x, to be the inverse of the exponential function, 10x, as
follows:
The logarithm to base 10 of x, written log10 x, is the power of 10 we need to get x. In other
words,
log10 x = c
means
10c = x.
We often write log x in place of log10 x.
The other frequently used base is e. The logarithm to base e is called the natural logarithm of
x, written ln x and deﬁned to be the inverse function of ex, as follows:
The natural logarithm of x, written ln x, is the power of e needed to get x. In other words,
ln x = c
means
ec = x.

30
Chapter One A LIBRARY OF FUNCTIONS
Values of log x are in Table 1.16. Because no power of 10 gives 0, log 0 is undeﬁned. The graph
of y = log x is shown in Figure 1.44. The domain of y = log x is positive real numbers; the range is
all real numbers. In contrast, the inverse function y = 10x has domain all real numbers and range all
positive real numbers. The graph of y = log x has a vertical asymptote at x = 0, whereas y = 10x
has a horizontal asymptote at y = 0.
One big difference between y = 10x and y = log x is that the exponential function grows
extremely quickly whereas the log function grows extremely slowly. However, log x does go to
inﬁnity, albeit slowly, as x increases. Since y = log x and y = 10x are inverse functions, the graphs
of the two functions are reﬂections of one another about the line y = x, provided the scales along
the x- and y-axes are equal.

Solving Equations Using Logarithms
Logs are frequently useful when we have to solve for unknown exponents, as in the next examples.
Example 1
Find t such that 2t = 7.
Solution
First, notice that we expect t to be between 2 and 3 (because 22 = 4 and 23 = 8). To calculate t, we
take logs to base 10 of both sides. (Natural logs could also be used.)
log(2t) = log 7.
Then use the third property of logs, which says log(2t) = t log 2, and get:
t log 2 = log 7.
Using a calculator to ﬁnd the logs gives
t = log 7
log 2 ≈2.81.
Example 2
Find when the population of Burkina Faso reaches 20 million by solving 20 = 12.853(1.034)t.
Solution
Dividing both sides of the equation by 12.853, we get
20
12.853 = (1.034)t.
Now take logs of both sides:
log

20
12.853

= log(1.034t).
Using the fact that log(At) = t log A, we get
log

20
12.853

= t log(1.034).
Solving this equation using a calculator to ﬁnd the logs, we get
t = log(20/12.853)
log(1.034)
= 13.22 years
which is between t = 13 and t = 14. This value of t corresponds to the year 2016.

tially at a continuous rate of 3.3% per meter.21 At what distance from the road is the concentration
of CO half what it is on the road?
Solution
If C0 is the concentration of CO on the road, then the concentration x meters from the road is
C = C0e−0.033x.
We want to ﬁnd the value of x making C = C0/2, that is,
C0e−0.033x = C0

Dividing by C0 and then taking natural logs yields

At 21 meters from the road the concentration of CO in the air is half the concentration on the road.

Chapter One A LIBRARY OF FUNCTIONS
In Example 3 the decay rate was given. However, in many situations where we expect to ﬁnd
exponential growth or decay, the rate is not given. To ﬁnd it, we must know the quantity at two
different times and then solve for the growth or decay rate, as in the next example.
Example 4
The population of Mexico was 99.9 million in 2000 and 113.4 million in 2010.22 Assuming it
increases exponentially, ﬁnd a formula for the population of Mexico as a function of time.
Solution
If we measure the population, P, in millions and time, t, in years since 2000, we can say
P = P0ekt = 99.9ekt,
where P0 = 99.9 is the initial value of P. We ﬁnd k by using the fact that P = 113.4 when t = 10,
so
113.4 = 99.9ek·10.
To ﬁnd k, we divide both sides by 99.9, giving
113.4
99.9 = 1.135 = e10k.
Now take natural logs of both sides:
ln(1.135) = ln(e10k).
Using a calculator and the fact that ln(e10k) = 10k, this becomes
0.127 = 10k.
So
k = 0.0127,
and therefore
P = 99.9e0.0127t.
Since k = 0.0127 = 1.27%, the population of Mexico was growing at a continuous rate of 1.27%
per year.
In Example 4 we chose to use e for the base of the exponential function representing Mexico’s
population, making clear that the continuous growth rate was 1.27%. If we had wanted to emphasize
the annual growth rate, we could have expressed the exponential function in the form P = P0at.
Example 5
Give a formula for the inverse of the following function (that is, solve for t in terms of P):
P = f(t) = 12.853(1.034)t.
Solution
We want a formula expressing t as a function of P. Take logs:
log P = log(12.853(1.034)t).
Since log(AB) = log A + log B, we have
log P = log 12.853 + log((1.034)t).
Now use log(At) = t log A:
log P = log 12.853 + t log 1.034.
Solve for t in two steps, using a calculator at the ﬁnal stage:
t log 1.034 = log P −log 12.853
t =
log P
log 1.034 −log 12.853
log 1.034 = 68.868 logP −76.375.

TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS
Trigonometry originated as part of the study of triangles. The name tri-gon-o-metry means the
measurement of three-cornered ﬁgures, and the ﬁrst deﬁnitions of the trigonometric functions were
in terms of triangles. However, the trigonometric functions can also be deﬁned using the unit circle,
a deﬁnition that makes them periodic, or repeating. Many naturally occurring processes are also
periodic. The water level in a tidal basin, the blood pressure in a heart, an alternating current, and
the position of the air molecules transmitting a musical note all ﬂuctuate regularly. Such phenomena
can be represented by trigonometric functions.
Radians
There are two commonly used ways to represent the input of the trigonometric functions: radians
and degrees. The formulas of calculus, as you will see, are neater in radians than in degrees.
An angle of 1 radian is deﬁned to be the angle at the center of a unit circle which cuts off an
arc of length 1, measured counterclockwise. (See Figure 1.48(a).) A unit circle has radius 1.
An angle of 2 radians cuts off an arc of length 2 on a unit circle. A negative angle, such as −1/2
radians, cuts off an arc of length 1/2, but measured clockwise. (See Figure 1.48(b).)

Figure 1.48: Radians deﬁned using unit circle
It is useful to think of angles as rotations, since then we can make sense of angles larger than
360◦; for example, an angle of 720◦represents two complete rotations counterclockwise. Since one
full rotation of 360◦cuts off an arc of length 2π, the circumference of the unit circle, it follows that
360◦= 2π radians,
so
180◦= π radians.
In other words, 1 radian = 180◦/π, so one radian is about 60◦. The word radians is often dropped,
so if an angle or rotation is referred to without units, it is understood to be in radians.
Radians are useful for computing the length of an arc in any circle. If the circle has radius r and
the arc cuts off an angle θ, as in Figure 1.49, then we have the following relation:
Arc length = s = rθ.

The Sine and Cosine Functions
The two basic trigonometric functions—the sine and cosine—are deﬁned using a unit circle. In
Figure 1.50, an angle of t radians is measured counterclockwise around the circle from the point
(1, 0). If P has coordinates (x, y), we deﬁne
cos t = x
and
sin t = y.
We assume that the angles are always in radians unless speciﬁed otherwise.
Since the equation of the unit circle is x2 + y2 = 1, writing cos2 t for (cos t)2, we have the
identity
cos2 t + sin2 t = 1.
As t increases and P moves around the circle, the values of sin t and cos t oscillate between 1 and
−1, and eventually repeat as P moves through points where it has been before. If t is negative, the
angle is measured clockwise around the circle.
Amplitude, Period, and Phase
The graphs of sine and cosine are shown in Figure 1.51. Notice that sine is an odd function, and
cosine is even. The maximum and minimum values of sine and cosine are +1 and −1, because those
are the maximum and minimum values of y and x on the unit circle. After the point P has moved
around the complete circle once, the values of cos t and sin t start to repeat; we say the functions
are periodic.
For any periodic function of time, the
• Amplitude is half the distance between the maximum and minimum values (if it exists).
• Period is the smallest time needed for the function to execute one complete cycle.
The amplitude of cos t and sin t is 1, and the period is 2π. Why 2π? Because that’s the value of
t when the point P has gone exactly once around the circle. (Remember that 360◦= 2π radians.)

Figure 1.51: Graphs of cos t and sin t
In Figure 1.51, we see that the sine and cosine graphs are exactly the same shape, only shifted
horizontally. Since the cosine graph is the sine graph shifted π/2 to the left,
cos t = sin(t + π/2).
Equivalently, the sine graph is the cosine graph shifted π/2 to the right, so
sin t = cos(t −π/2).

38
Chapter One A LIBRARY OF FUNCTIONS
We say that the phase difference or phase shift between sin t and cos t is π/2.
Functions whose graphs are the shape of a sine or cosine curve are called sinusoidal functions.
To describe arbitrary amplitudes and periods of sinusoidal functions, we use functions of the
form
f(t) = A sin(Bt)
and
g(t) = A cos(Bt),
where |A| is the amplitude and 2π/|B| is the period.
The graph of a sinusoidal function is shifted horizontally by a distance |h| when t is replaced
by t −h or t + h.
Functions of the form f(t) = A sin(Bt) + C and g(t) = A cos(Bt) + C have graphs which
are shifted vertically by C and oscillate about this value.

(a) y = 5 sin(2t)
(b) y = −5 sin
 t
2

(c) y = 1 + 2 sin t
Solution
(a) From Figure 1.52, you can see that the amplitude of y = 5 sin(2t) is 5 because the factor of 5
stretches the oscillations up to 5 and down to −5. The period of y = sin(2t) is π, because when
t changes from 0 to π, the quantity 2t changes from 0 to 2π, so the sine function goes through
one complete oscillation.
(b) Figure 1.53 shows that the amplitude of y = −5 sin(t/2) is again 5, because the negative sign
reﬂects the oscillations in the t-axis, but does not change how far up or down they go. The period
of y = −5 sin (t/2) is 4π because when t changes from 0 to 4π, the quantity t/2 changes from
0 to 2π, so the sine function goes through one complete oscillation.
(c) The 1 shifts the graph y = 2 sin t up by 1. Since y = 2 sin t has an amplitude of 2 and a period
of 2π, the graph of y = 1 + 2 sin t goes up to 3 and down to −1, and has a period of 2π. (See
Figure 1.54.) Thus, y = 1 + 2 sin t also has amplitude 2.

1.5 TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS
39
Solution
(a) This function looks like a sine function with amplitude 3, so g(t) = 3 sin(Bt). Since the func-
tion executes one full oscillation between t = 0 and t = 12π, when t changes by 12π, the quan-
tity Bt changes by 2π. This means B · 12π = 2π, so B = 1/6. Therefore, g(t) = 3 sin(t/6)
has the graph shown.
(b) This function looks like an upside-down cosine function with amplitude 2, so f(t) = −2 cos(Bt).
The function completes one oscillation between t = 0 and t = 4. Thus, when t changes by 4,
the quantity Bt changes by 2π, so B · 4 = 2π, or B = π/2. Therefore, f(t) = −2 cos(πt/2)
has the graph shown.
(c) This function looks like the function g(t) in part (a), but shifted a distance of π to the right.
Since g(t) = 3 sin(t/6), we replace t by (t −π) to obtain h(t) = 3 sin[(t −π)/6].
Example 3
On July 1, 2007, high tide in Boston was at midnight. The water level at high tide was 9.9 feet; later,
at low tide, it was 0.1 feet. Assuming the next high tide is at exactly 12 noon and that the height of
the water is given by a sine or cosine curve, ﬁnd a formula for the water level in Boston as a function
of time.
Solution
Let y be the water level in feet, and let t be the time measured in hours from midnight. The os-
cillations have amplitude 4.9 feet (= (9.9 −0.1)/2) and period 12, so 12B = 2π and B = π/6.
Since the water is highest at midnight, when t = 0, the oscillations are best represented by a cosine
function. (See Figure 1.55.) We can say
Height above average = 4.9 cos
π
6 t

.
Since the average water level was 5 feet (= (9.9 + 0.1)/2), we shift the cosine up by adding 5:

Figure 1.55: Function approximating the tide in Boston on July 1, 2007
Example 4
Of course, there’s something wrong with the assumption in Example 3 that the next high tide is
at noon. If so, the high tide would always be at noon or midnight, instead of progressing slowly
through the day, as in fact it does. The interval between successive high tides actually averages
about 12 hours 24 minutes. Using this, give a more accurate formula for the height of the water as a
function of time.
Solution
The period is 12 hours 24 minutes = 12.4 hours, so B = 2π/12.4, giving
y = 5 + 4.9 cos
 2π

= 5 + 4.9 cos(0.507t).

Use the information from Example 4 to write a formula for the water level in Boston on a day when
the high tide is at 2 pm.

Chapter One A LIBRARY OF FUNCTIONS
Solution
When the high tide is at midnight,
y = 5 + 4.9 cos(0.507t).
Since 2 pm is 14 hours after midnight, we replace t by (t −14). Therefore, on a day when the high
tide is at 2 pm,
y = 5 + 4.9 cos(0.507(t −14)).
The Tangent Function
If t is any number with cos t ̸= 0, we deﬁne the tangent function as follows
tan t = sin t
cos t.
Figure 1.50 on page 37 shows the geometrical meaning of the tangent function: tan t is the
slope of the line through the origin (0, 0) and the point P = (cos t, sin t) on the unit circle.
The tangent function is undeﬁned wherever cos t = 0, namely, at t = ±π/2, ±3π/2, ..., and it
has a vertical asymptote at each of these points. The function tan t is positive where sin t and cos t
have the same sign. The graph of the tangent is shown in Figure 1.56.

Figure 1.57: Multiple of tangent
The tangent function has period π, because it repeats every π units. Does it make sense to talk
about the amplitude of the tangent function? Not if we’re thinking of the amplitude as a measure of
the size of the oscillation, because the tangent becomes inﬁnitely large near each vertical asymptote.
We can still multiply the tangent by a constant, but that constant no longer represents an amplitude.
(See Figure 1.57.)
The Inverse Trigonometric Functions
On occasion, you may need to ﬁnd a number with a given sine. For example, you might want to ﬁnd
x such that
sin x = 0
or such that
sin x = 0.3.
The ﬁrst of these equations has solutions x = 0, ±π, ±2π, .... The second equation also has
inﬁnitely many solutions. Using a calculator and a graph, we get
x ≈0.305, 2.84, 0.305 ± 2π, 2.84 ± 2π, . . . .

1.5 TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS
41
For each equation, we pick out the solution between −π/2 and π/2 as the preferred solution.
For example, the preferred solution to sin x = 0 is x = 0, and the preferred solution to sin x = 0.3
is x = 0.305. We deﬁne the inverse sine, written “arcsin” or “sin−1,” as the function which gives
the preferred solution.
For −1 ≤y ≤1,
arcsin y = x
means
sin x = y
with
−π
2 ≤x ≤π
2 .
Thus the arcsine is the inverse function to the piece of the sine function having domain [−π/2, π/2].
(See Table 1.17 and Figure 1.58.) On a calculator, the arcsine function34 is usually denoted by
sin−1 .

POWERS, POLYNOMIALS, AND RATIONAL FUNCTIONS
Power Functions
A power function is a function in which the dependent variable is proportional to a power of the
independent variable:
A power function has the form
f(x) = kxp,
where k and p are constant.
For example, the volume, V , of a sphere of radius r is given by
V = g(r) = 4
3πr3.
As another example, the gravitational force, F, on a unit mass at a distance r from the center of the
earth is given by Newton’s Law of Gravitation, which says that, for some positive constant k,
F = k
r2
or
F = kr−2.
We consider the graphs of the power functions xn, with n a positive integer. Figures 1.66
and 1.67 show that the graphs fall into two groups: odd and even powers. For n greater than 1, the
odd powers have a “seat” at the origin and are increasing everywhere else. The even powers are
ﬁrst decreasing and then increasing. For large x, the higher the power of x, the faster the function
climbs.

Exponentials and Power Functions: Which Dominate?
In everyday language, the word exponential is often used to imply very fast growth. But do expo-
nential functions always grow faster than power functions? To determine what happens “in the long
run,” we often want to know which functions dominate as x gets arbitrarily large.
Let’s consider y = 2x and y = x3. The close-up view in Figure 1.68(a) shows that between
x = 2 and x = 4, the graph of y = 2x lies below the graph of y = x3. The far-away view in Fig-
ure 1.68(b) shows that the exponential function y = 2x eventually overtakes y = x3. Figure 1.68(c),
which gives a very far-away view, shows that, for large x, the value of x3 is insigniﬁcant compared
to 2x. Indeed, 2x is growing so much faster than x3 that the graph of 2x appears almost vertical in
comparison to the more leisurely climb of x3.
We say that Figure 1.68(a) gives a local view of the functions’ behavior, whereas Figure 1.68(c)
gives a global view.

In fact, every exponential growth function eventually dominates every power function. Al-
though an exponential function may be below a power function for some values of x, if we look
at large enough x-values, ax (with a > 1) will eventually dominate xn, no matter what n is.
Polynomials
Polynomials are the sums of power functions with nonnegative integer exponents:
y = p(x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x + a0.

Here n is a nonnegative integer called the degree of the polynomial, and an, an−1, . . . , a1, a0 are

y = p(x) = 2x3 −x2 −5x −7.
In this case a3 = 2, a2 = −1, a1 = −5, and a0 = −7. The shape of the graph of a polynomial
depends on its degree; typical graphs are shown in Figure 1.69. These graphs correspond to a pos-
itive coefﬁcient for xn; a negative leading coefﬁcient turns the graph upside down. Notice that the
quadratic “turns around” once, the cubic “turns around” twice, and the quartic (fourth degree) “turns
around” three times. An nth degree polynomial “turns around” at most n −1 times (where n is a
positive integer), but there may be fewer turns.

Solution
(a) This graph appears to be a parabola, turned upside down, and moved up by 4, so
f(x) = −x2 + 4.
The negative sign turns the parabola upside down and the +4 moves it up by 4. Notice that this
formula does give the correct x-intercepts since 0 = −x2 + 4 has solutions x = ±2. These
values of x are called zeros of f.
We can also solve this problem by looking at the x-intercepts ﬁrst, which tell us that f(x)
has factors of (x + 2) and (x −2). So
f(x) = k(x + 2)(x −2).
To ﬁnd k, use the fact that the graph has a y-intercept of 4, so f(0) = 4, giving
4 = k(0 + 2)(0 −2),
or k = −1. Therefore, f(x) = −(x + 2)(x −2), which multiplies out to −x2 + 4.
Note that f(x) = 4 −x4/4 also has the same basic shape, but is ﬂatter near x = 0. There
are many possible answers to these questions.
(b) This looks like a cubic with factors (x + 3), (x −1), and (x −2), one for each intercept:
g(x) = k(x + 3)(x −1)(x −2).
Since the y-intercept is −12, we have
−12 = k(0 + 3)(0 −1)(0 −2).

48
Chapter One A LIBRARY OF FUNCTIONS
So k = −2, and we get the cubic polynomial
g(x) = −2(x + 3)(x −1)(x −2).
(c) This also looks like a cubic with zeros at x = 2 and x = −3. Notice that at x = 2 the graph of
h(x) touches the x-axis but does not cross it, whereas at x = −3 the graph crosses the x-axis.
We say that x = 2 is a double zero, but that x = −3 is a single zero.
To ﬁnd a formula for h(x), imagine the graph of h(x) to be slightly lower down, so that the
graph has one x-intercept near x = −3 and two near x = 2, say at x = 1.9 and x = 2.1. Then
a formula would be
h(x) ≈k(x + 3)(x −1.9)(x −2.1).
Now move the graph back to its original position. The zeros at x = 1.9 and x = 2.1 move
toward x = 2, giving
h(x) = k(x + 3)(x −2)(x −2) = k(x + 3)(x −2)2.
The double zero leads to a repeated factor, (x−2)2. Notice that when x > 2, the factor (x−2)2
is positive, and when x < 2, the factor (x −2)2 is still positive. This reﬂects the fact that
h(x) does not change sign near x = 2. Compare this with the behavior near the single zero at
x = −3, where h does change sign.
We cannot ﬁnd k, as no coordinates are given for points off of the x-axis. Any positive
value of k stretches the graph vertically but does not change the zeros, so any positive k works.
Example 2
Using a calculator or computer, graph y = x4 and y = x4 −15x2 −15x for −4 ≤x ≤4 and for
−20 ≤x ≤20. Set the y range to −100 ≤y ≤100 for the ﬁrst domain, and to −100 ≤y ≤
200,000 for the second. What do you observe?
Solution
From the graphs in Figure 1.71 we see that close up (−4 ≤x ≤4) the graphs look different; from
far away, however, they are almost indistinguishable. The reason is that the leading terms (those
with the highest power of x) are the same, namely x4, and for large values of x, the leading term
dominates the other terms.

Rational Functions
Rational functions are ratios of polynomials, p and q:
f(x) = p(x)
q(x).
Example 3
Look at a graph and explain the behavior of y =
1
x2 + 4.
Solution
The function is even, so the graph is symmetric about the y-axis. As x gets larger, the denominator
gets larger, making the value of the function closer to 0. Thus the graph gets arbitrarily close to the
x-axis as x increases without bound. See Figure 1.72.

y
Figure 1.72: Graph of y =

x2+4
In the previous example, we say that y = 0 (i.e. the x-axis) is a horizontal asymptote. Writing
“→” to mean “tends to,” we have y →0 as x →∞and y →0 as x →−∞.
If the graph of y = f(x) approaches a horizontal line y = L as x →∞or x →−∞, then
the line y = L is called a horizontal asymptote.37 This occurs when
f(x) →L
as
x →∞
or
f(x) →L
as
x →−∞.
If the graph of y = f(x) approaches the vertical line x = K as x →K from one side or the
other, that is, if
y →∞
or
y →−∞
when
x →K,
then the line x = K is called a vertical asymptote.
The graphs of rational functions may have vertical asymptotes where the denominator is zero.
For example, the function in Example 3 has no vertical asymptotes as the denominator is never
zero. The function in Example 4 has two vertical asymptotes corresponding to the two zeros in the
denominator.
Rational functions have horizontal asymptotes if f(x) approaches a ﬁnite number as x →∞
or x →−∞. We call the behavior of a function as x →±∞its end behavior.
Example 4
Look at a graph and explain the behavior of y = 3x2 −12
x2 −1 , including end behavior.
Solution
Factoring gives
y = 3x2 −12
x2 −1
= 3(x + 2)(x −2)
(x + 1)(x −1)
so x = ±1 are vertical asymptotes. If y = 0, then 3(x + 2)(x −2) = 0 or x = ±2; these are the
x-intercepts. Note that zeros of the denominator give rise to the vertical asymptotes, whereas zeros
of the numerator give rise to x-intercepts. Substituting x = 0 gives y = 12; this is the y-intercept.
The function is even, so the graph is symmetric about the y-axis.
37We are assuming that f(x) gets arbitrarily close to L as x →∞.

To see what happens as x →±∞, look at the y-values in Table 1.18. Clearly y is getting closer
to 3 as x gets large positively or negatively. Alternatively, realize that as x →±∞, only the highest
powers of x matter. For large x, the 12 and the 1 are insigniﬁcant compared to x2, so
y = 3x2 −12
x2 −1
≈3x2
x2 = 3
for large x.
So y →3 as x →±∞, and therefore the horizontal asymptote is y = 3. See Figure 1.73. Since, for
x > 1, the value of (3x2 −12)/(x2 −1) is less than 3, the graph lies below its asymptote. (Why
doesn’t the graph lie below y = 3 when −1 < x < 1?)

INTRODUCTION TO CONTINUITY
This section gives an intuitive introduction to the idea of continuity. This leads to the concept of
limit and a deﬁnition of continuity in Section 1.8.
Continuity of a Function on an Interval: Graphical Viewpoint
Roughly speaking, a function is said to be continuous on an interval if its graph has no breaks,
jumps, or holes in that interval. Continuity is important because, as we shall see, continuous func-
tions have many desirable properties.
For example, to locate the zeros of a function, we often look for intervals where the function
changes sign. In the case of the function f(x) = 3x3 −x2 + 2x −1, for instance, we expect38
to ﬁnd a zero between 0 and 1 because f(0) = −1 and f(1) = 3. (See Figure 1.79.) To be sure
that f(x) has a zero there, we need to know that the graph of the function has no breaks or jumps
in it. Otherwise the graph could jump across the x-axis, changing sign but not creating a zero. For
example, f(x) = 1/x has opposite signs at x = −1 and x = 1, but no zeros for −1 ≤x ≤1
38This is due to the Intermediate Value Theorem, which is discussed on page 55.

54
Chapter One A LIBRARY OF FUNCTIONS
because of the break at x = 0. (See Figure 1.80.) To be certain that a function has a zero in an
interval on which it changes sign, we need to know that the function is deﬁned and continuous in
that interval.

Figure 1.81: Cost of mailing a letter
A continuous function has a graph which can be drawn without lifting the pencil from the paper.
Example: The function f(x) = 3x3 −x2 + 2x −1 is continuous on any interval. (See Fig-
ure 1.79.)
Example: The function f(x) = 1/x is not deﬁned at x = 0. It is continuous on any interval not
containing the origin. (See Figure 1.80.)
Example: Suppose p(x) is the price of mailing a ﬁrst-class letter weighing x ounces. It costs
45c/ for one ounce or less, 65c/ between one and two ounces, and so on. So the graph (in Figure 1.81)
is a series of steps. This function is not continuous on any open interval containing a positive integer
because the graph jumps at these points.
Which Functions Are Continuous?
Requiring a function to be continuous on an interval is not asking very much, as any function whose
graph is an unbroken curve over the interval is continuous. For example, exponential functions, poly-
nomials, and the sine and cosine are continuous on every interval. Rational functions are continuous
on any interval in which their denominators are not zero. Functions created by adding, multiplying,
or composing continuous functions are also continuous.
The Intermediate Value Theorem
Continuity tells us about the values taken by a function. In particular, a continuous function cannot
skip values. For example, the function in the next example must have a zero because its graph cannot
skip over the x-axis.

Figure 1.82: Zeros occur where the graph of a
continuous function crosses the horizontal axis
Solution
Since f(x) is the difference of two continuous functions, it is continuous. We conclude that f(x)
has at least one zero in the interval 0.6 < x < 0.8, since f(x) changes from positive to negative on
that interval. The graph of f(x) in Figure 1.82 suggests that there is only one zero in the interval
0 ≤x ≤1, but we cannot be sure of this from the graph or the table of values.

1.7 INTRODUCTION TO CONTINUITY
55
In the previous example, we concluded that f(x) = cos x −2x2 has a zero between x = 0
and x = 1 because f(x) is positive at x = 0 and negative at x = 1. More generally, an intuitive
notion of continuity tells us that, as we follow the graph of a continuous function f from some point
(a, f(a)) to another point (b, f(b)), then f takes on all intermediate values between f(a) and f(b).
(See Figure 1.83.) This is:
Theorem 1.1: Intermediate Value Theorem
Suppose f is continuous on a closed interval [a, b]. If k is any number between f(a) and f(b),
then there is at least one number c in [a, b] such that f(c) = k.
The Intermediate Value Theorem depends on the formal deﬁnition of continuity given in Sec-
tion 1.8. See also www.wiley.com/college/hughes-hallett.The key idea is to ﬁnd successively smaller
subintervals of [a, b] on which f changes from less than k to more than k. These subintervals con-
verge on the number c.

Figure 1.83: The Intermediate Value Theorem
Continuity of a Function at a Point: Numerical Viewpoint
A function is continuous if nearby values of the independent variable give nearby values of the func-
tion. In practical work, continuity is important because it means that small errors in the independent
variable lead to small errors in the value of the function.
Example: Suppose that f(x) = x2 and that we want to compute f(π). Knowing f is continuous
tells us that taking x = 3.14 should give a good approximation to f(π), and that we can get as
accurate an approximation to f(π) as we want by using enough decimals of π.
Example: If p(x) is the cost of mailing a letter weighing x ounces, then p(0.99) = p(1) = 45c/,
whereas p(1.01) = 65c/, because as soon as we get over 1 ounce, the price jumps up to 65c/. So
a small difference in the weight of a letter can lead to a signiﬁcant difference in its mailing cost.
Hence p is not continuous at x = 1.
In other words, if f(x) is continuous at x = c, the values of f(x) approach f(c) as x ap-
proaches c. Using the concept of a limit introduced in Section 1.8, we can deﬁne more precisely
what it means for the values of f(x) to approach f(c) as x approaches c.
Example 2
Investigate the continuity of f(x) = x2 at x = 2.
Solution
From Table 1.21, it appears that the values of f(x) = x2 approach f(2) = 4 as x approaches 2.
Thus f appears to be continuous at x = 2. Continuity at a point describes behavior of a function
near a point, as well as at the point.

LIMITS
The concept of limit is the underpinning of calculus. In Section 1.7, we said that a function f is
continuous at x = c if the values of f(x) approach f(c) as x approaches c. In this section, we deﬁne
a limit, which makes precise what we mean by approaching.

58
Chapter One A LIBRARY OF FUNCTIONS
The Idea of a Limit
We ﬁrst introduce some notation:
We write lim
x→c f(x) = L if the values of f(x) approach L as x approaches c.
How should we ﬁnd L, or even know whether such a number exists? We will look for trends in the
values of f(x) as x gets closer to c, but x ̸= c. A graph from a calculator or computer often helps.

Figure 1.85: Find the limit as θ →0
Solution
Figure 1.85 shows that as θ approaches 0 from either side, the value of sin θ/θ appears to approach
1, suggesting that lim
θ→0(sin θ/θ) = 1. Zooming in on the graph near θ = 0 provides further support
for this conclusion. Notice that sin θ/θ is undeﬁned at θ = 0.
Figure 1.85 strongly suggests that lim
θ→0(sin θ/θ) = 1, but to be sure we need to be more precise
about words like “approach” and “close.”
Definition of Limit
By the beginning of the 19th century, calculus had proved its worth, and there was no doubt about
the correctness of its answers. However, it was not until the work of the French mathematician
Augustin Cauchy (1789–1857) that calculus was put on a rigorous footing. Cauchy gave a formal
deﬁnition of the limit, similar to the following:
A function f is deﬁned on an interval around c, except perhaps at the point x = c. We deﬁne
the limit of the function f(x) as x approaches c, written limx→c f(x), to be a number L (if
one exists) such that f(x) is as close to L as we want whenever x is sufﬁciently close to c
(but x ̸= c). If L exists, we write
lim
x→c f(x) = L.
Shortly, we see how “as close as we want” and “sufﬁciently close” are expressed using inequalities.
First, we look at lim
θ→0(sin θ/θ) more closely (see Example 1).

1.8 LIMITS
59
Example 2
By graphing y = (sin θ)/θ in an appropriate window, ﬁnd how close θ should be to 0 in order to
make (sin θ)/θ within 0.01 of 1.
Solution
Since we want (sin θ)/θ to be within 0.01 of 1, we set the y-range on the graphing window to go
from 0.99 to 1.01. Our ﬁrst attempt with −0.5 ≤θ ≤0.5 yields the graph in Figure 1.86. Since
we want the y-values to stay within the range 0.99 < y < 1.01, we do not want the graph to
leave the window through the top or bottom. By trial and error, we ﬁnd that changing the θ-range
to −0.2 ≤θ ≤0.2 gives the graph in Figure 1.87. Thus, the graph suggests that (sin θ)/θ is within
0.01 of 1 whenever θ is within 0.2 of 0. Proving this requires an analytical argument, not just graphs
from a calculator.

When we say “f(x) is close to L,” we measure closeness by the distance between f(x) and L,
expressed using absolute values:
|f(x) −L| = Distance between f(x) and L.
When we say “as close to L as we want,” we use ϵ (the Greek letter epsilon) to specify how close.
We write
|f(x) −L| < ϵ
to indicate that we want the distance between f(x) and L to be less than ϵ. In Example 2 we used
ϵ = 0.01. Similarly, we interpret “x is sufﬁciently close to c” as specifying a distance between x
and c:
|x −c| < δ,
where δ (the Greek letter delta) tells us how close x should be to c. In Example 2 we found δ = 0.2.
If lim
x→c f(x) = L, we know that no matter how narrow the horizontal band determined by ϵ in
Figure 1.88, there is always a δ which makes the graph stay within that band, for c−δ < x < c+ δ.
Thus we restate the deﬁnition of a limit, using symbols:
Deﬁnition of Limit
We deﬁne lim
x→c f(x) to be the number L (if one exists) such that for every ϵ > 0 (as small
as we want), there is a δ > 0 (sufﬁciently small) such that if |x −c| < δ and x ̸= c, then
|f(x) −L| < ϵ.
We have arrived at a formal deﬁnition of limit. Let’s see if it agrees with our intuition.

Figure 1.88: What the deﬁnition of the limit means graphically
Example 3
Use the deﬁnition of limit to show that lim
x→3 2x = 6.
Solution
We must show how, given any ϵ > 0, we can ﬁnd a δ > 0 such that
If |x −3| < δ and x ̸= 3, then |2x −6| < ϵ.
Since |2x −6| = 2|x −3|, to get |2x −6| < ϵ we require that |x −3| < ϵ/2. Thus we take δ = ϵ/2.
It is important to understand that the ϵ, δ deﬁnition does not make it easier to calculate limits;
rather, the ϵ, δ deﬁnition makes it possible to put calculus on a rigorous foundation. From this
foundation, we can prove the following properties. See Problems 78–80.

One- and Two-Sided Limits
When we write
lim
x→2 f(x),
we mean the number that f(x) approaches as x approaches 2 from both sides. We examine values
of f(x) as x approaches 2 through values greater than 2 (such as 2.1, 2.01, 2.003) and values less
than 2 (such as 1.9, 1.99, 1.994). If we want x to approach 2 only through values greater than 2, we
write
lim
x→2+ f(x)
for the number that f(x) approaches (assuming such a number exists). Similarly,
lim
x→2−f(x)
denotes the number (if it exists) obtained by letting x approach 2 through values less than 2. We call
lim
x→2+ f(x) a right-hand limit and lim
x→2−f(x) a left-hand limit. Problems 43 and 44 ask for formal
deﬁnitions of left- and right-hand limits.

For the function graphed in Figure 1.89, we have
lim
x→2−f(x) = L1
lim
x→2+ f(x) = L2.
If the left- and right-hand limits were equal, that is, if L1 = L2, then it can be proved that lim
x→2 f(x)
exists and lim
x→2 f(x) = L1 = L2. Since L1 ̸= L2 in Figure 1.89, we see that lim
x→2 f(x) does not
exist in this case.
When Limits Do Not Exist
Whenever there is no number L such that lim
x→c f(x) = L, we say lim
x→c f(x) does not exist. Here are
three examples in which limits fail to exist.

62
Chapter One A LIBRARY OF FUNCTIONS
Example 5
Explain why lim
x→2
|x −2|
x −2 does not exist.
Solution
Figure 1.90 shows the problem: The right-hand limit and the left-hand limit are different. For x > 2,
we have |x −2| = x −2, so as x approaches 2 from the right,
lim
x→2+
|x −2|
x −2 = lim
x→2+
x −2
x −2 = lim
x→2+ 1 = 1.
Similarly, if x < 2, then |x −2| = 2 −x so
lim
x→2−
|x −2|
x −2 = lim
x→2−
2 −x
x −2 = lim
x→2−(−1) = −1.
So if lim
x→2
|x −2|
x −2 = L then L would have to be both 1 and −1. Since L cannot have two different
values, the limit does not exist.

Example 6
Explain why lim
x→0
1
x2 does not exist.
Solution
As x approaches zero, 1/x2 becomes arbitrarily large, so it cannot approach any ﬁnite number L.
See Figure 1.91. Therefore we say 1/x2 has no limit as x →0.
If lim
x→a f(x) does not exist because f(x) gets arbitrarily large on both sides of a, we also say
lim
x→a f(x) = ∞. So in Example 6 we could say lim
x→0 1/x2 = ∞. This behavior may also be described
as “diverging to inﬁnity.”
Example 7
Explain why lim
x→0 sin
 1
x

does not exist.
Solution
The sine function has values between −1 and 1. The graph in Figure 1.92 oscillates more and more
rapidly as x →0. There are x-values approaching 0 where sin(1/x) = −1. There are also x-values
approaching 0 where sin(1/x) = 1. So if the limit existed, it would have to be both −1 and 1. Thus,
the limit does not exist.

1.8 LIMITS
63
Limits at Infinity
Sometimes we want to know what happens to f(x) as x gets large, that is, the end behavior of f.
If f(x) gets as close to a number L as we please when x gets sufﬁciently large, then we write
lim
x→∞f(x) = L.
Similarly, if f(x) approaches L when x is negative and has a sufﬁciently large absolute value,
then we write
lim
x→−∞f(x) = L.
The symbol ∞does not represent a number. Writing x →∞means that we consider arbitrarily
large values of x. If the limit of f(x) as x →∞or x →−∞is L, we say that the graph of f has
y = L as a horizontal asymptote. Problem 45 asks for a formal deﬁnition of limx→∞f(x).
Example 8
Investigate lim
x→∞
1
x and
lim
x→−∞

Solution
A graph of f(x) = 1/x in a large window shows 1/x approaching zero as x increases in either the
positive or the negative direction (see Figure 1.93). This is as we would expect, since dividing 1 by
larger and larger numbers yields answers which are closer and closer to zero. This suggests that
lim
x→∞

x =
lim
x→−∞

x = 0,
and that f(x) = 1/x has y = 0 as a horizontal asymptote as x →±∞.

Definition of Continuity
We can now give a precise deﬁnition of continuity using limits.
The function f is continuous at x = c if f is deﬁned at x = c and if
lim
x→c f(x) = f(c).
In other words, f(x) is as close as we want to f(c) provided x is close enough to c. The
function is continuous on an interval [a, b] if it is continuous at every point in the interval.39
Constant functions and f(x) = x are continuous for all x. Using the continuity of sums and
products, we can show that any polynomial is continuous. Proving that sin x, cos x, and ex are
39If c is an endpoint of the interval, we deﬁne continuity at x = c using one-sided limits at c.

64
Chapter One A LIBRARY OF FUNCTIONS
continuous is more difﬁcult. The following theorem, based on the properties of limits on page 60,
makes it easier to decide whether certain combinations of functions are continuous.
Theorem 1.3: Continuity of Sums, Products, and Quotients of Functions
Suppose that f and g are continuous on an interval and that b is a constant. Then, on that
same interval,
1. bf(x) is continuous.
2. f(x) + g(x) is continuous.
3. f(x)g(x) is continuous.
4. f(x)/g(x) is continuous,provided g(x) ̸= 0 on the interval.
We prove the third of these properties.
Proof Let c be any point in the interval. We must show that lim
x→c(f(x)g(x)) = f(c)g(c). Since f(x) and
g(x) are continuous, we know that lim
x→c f(x) = f(c) and lim
x→c g(x) = g(c). So, by the third property
of limits in Theorem 1.2,
lim
x→c(f(x)g(x)) =

lim
x→c f(x)
 
lim
x→c g(x)

= f(c)g(c).
Since c was chosen arbitrarily, we have shown that f(x)g(x) is continuous at every point in the
interval.
Theorem 1.4: Continuity of Composite Functions
If f and g are continuous, and if the composite function f(g(x)) is deﬁned on an interval,
then f(g(x)) is continuous on that interval.
Assuming the continuity of sin x and ex, Theorem 1.4 shows us, for example, that sin(ex) and esin x
are both continuous.
Although we now have a formal deﬁnition of continuity, some properties of continuous func-
tions, such as the Intermediate Value Theorem, can be difﬁcult to prove. For a further treatment of
limits and continuity, see www.wiley.com/college/hughes-hallett.

you know. If a statement is false, give a counterexample.
89. limx→3(xf(x)) = 21.

98. For any positive ϵ, we can ﬁnd a positive δ such that, pro-
vided x is within δ of c, and x ̸= c, we can be sure that
f(x) is within ϵ of L.
99. For each ϵ > 0, there is a δ > 0 such that if x is not
within δ of c, then f(x) is not within ϵ of L.
100. For each ϵ > 0, there is some δ > 0 such that if f(x) is
within ϵ of L, then we can be sure that x is within δ of c.

KEY CONCEPT: THE DERIVATIVE
2.1
HOW DO WE MEASURE SPEED?
The speed of an object at an instant in time is surprisingly difﬁcult to deﬁne precisely. Consider
the statement: “At the instant it crossed the ﬁnish line, the horse was traveling at 42 mph.” How can
such a claim be substantiated? A photograph taken at that instant will show the horse motionless—it
is no help at all. There is some paradox in trying to study the horse’s motion at a particular instant
in time, since by focusing on a single instant we stop the motion!
Problems of motion were of central concern to Zeno and other philosophers as early as the ﬁfth
century B.C. The modern approach, made famous by Newton’s calculus, is to stop looking for a
simple notion of speed at an instant, and instead to look at speed over small time intervals containing
the instant. This method sidesteps the philosophical problems mentioned earlier but introduces new
ones of its own.
We illustrate the ideas discussed above by an idealized example, called a thought experiment.
It is idealized in the sense that we assume that we can make measurements of distance and time as
accurately as we wish.
A Thought Experiment: Average and Instantaneous Velocity
We look at the speed of a small object (say, a grapefruit) that is thrown straight upward into the
air at t = 0 seconds. The grapefruit leaves the thrower’s hand at high speed, slows down until it
reaches its maximum height, and then speeds up in the downward direction and ﬁnally, “Splat!”
(See Figure 2.1.)
Suppose that we want to determine the speed, say, at t = 1 second. Table 2.1 gives the height,
y, of the grapefruit above the ground as a function of time. During the ﬁrst second the grapefruit
travels 90 −6 = 84 feet, and during the second second it travels only 142 −90 = 52 feet. Hence
the grapefruit traveled faster over the ﬁrst interval, 0 ≤t ≤1, than the second interval, 1 ≤t ≤2.

Velocity versus Speed
From now on, we will distinguish between velocity and speed. Suppose an object moves along a
line. We pick one direction to be positive and say that the velocity is positive if it is in the same
direction, and negative if it is in the opposite direction. For the grapefruit, upward is positive and
downward is negative. (See Figure 2.1.) Speed is the magnitude of the velocity and so is always
positive or zero.
If s(t) is the position of an object at time t, then the average velocity of the object over the
interval a ≤t ≤b is
Average velocity = Change in position
Change in time
= s(b) −s(a)
b −a
.
In words, the average velocity of an object over an interval is the net change in position
during the interval divided by the change in time.

2.1 HOW DO WE MEASURE SPEED?
77
Example 1
Compute the average velocity of the grapefruit over the interval 4 ≤t ≤5. What is the signiﬁcance
of the sign of your answer?
Solution
During this one-second interval, the grapefruit moves (106 −150) = −44 feet. Therefore the
average velocity is −44/(5 −4) = −44 ft/sec. The negative sign means the height is decreasing
and the grapefruit is moving downward.
Example 2
Compute the average velocity of the grapefruit over the interval 1 ≤t ≤3.
Solution
Average velocity = (162 −90)/(3 −1) = 72/2 = 36 ft/sec.
The average velocity is a useful concept since it gives a rough idea of the behavior of the
grapefruit: If two grapefruits are hurled into the air, and one has an average velocity of 10 ft/sec
over the interval 0 ≤t ≤1 while the second has an average velocity of 100 ft/sec over the same
interval, the second one is moving faster.
But average velocity over an interval does not solve the problem of measuring the velocity of
the grapefruit at exactly t = 1 second. To get closer to an answer to that question, we have to look
at what happens near t = 1 in more detail. The data1 in Figure 2.2 shows the average velocity over
small intervals on either side of t = 1.
Notice that the average velocity before t = 1 is slightly more than the average velocity after
t = 1. We expect to deﬁne the velocity at t = 1 to be between these two average velocities. As the
size of the interval shrinks, the values of the velocity before t = 1 and the velocity after t = 1 get
closer together. In the smallest interval in Figure 2.2, both velocities are 68.0 ft/sec (to one decimal
place), so we deﬁne the velocity at t = 1 to be 68.0 ft/sec (to one decimal place).

Figure 2.2: Average velocities over intervals on either side of t = 1: showing successively smaller intervals
Of course, if we calculate to more decimal places, the average velocities before and after t = 1
would no longer agree. To calculate the velocity at t = 1 to more decimal places of accuracy,
we take smaller and smaller intervals on either side of t = 1 until the average velocities agree to
the number of decimal places we want. In this way, we can estimate the velocity at t = 1 to any
accuracy.
1The data is in fact calculated from the formula y = 6 + 100t −16t2.

KEY CONCEPT: THE DERIVATIVE
Defining Instantaneous Velocity Using Limit Notation
When we take smaller and smaller intervals, it turns out that the average velocities get closer and
closer to 68 ft/sec. It seems natural, then, to deﬁne instantaneous velocity at the instant t = 1 to
be 68 ft/sec. Its deﬁnition depends on our being convinced that smaller and smaller intervals give
averages that come arbitrarily close to 68; that is, the average speed approaches 68 ft/sec as a limit.
Notice how we have replaced the original difﬁculty of computing velocity at a point by a search
for an argument to convince ourselves that the average velocities approach a limit as the time inter-
vals shrink in size. Showing that the limit is exactly 68 requires the precise deﬁnition of limit given
in Section 1.8.
To deﬁne instantaneous velocity at an arbitrary point t = a, we use the same method as for
t = 1. On small intervals of size h around t = a, we calculate
Average velocity = s(a + h) −s(a)
h
.
The instantaneous velocity is the number that the average velocities approach as the intervals de-
crease in size, that is, as h becomes smaller. So we make the following deﬁnition:
Let s(t) be the position at time t. Then the instantaneous velocity at t = a is deﬁned as
Instantaneous velocity
at t = a
=
lim
h→0
s(a + h) −s(a)
h
.
In words, the instantaneous velocity of an object at time t = a is given by the limit of the
average velocity over an interval, as the interval shrinks around a.
This limit refers to the number that the average velocities approach as the intervals shrink. To
estimate the limit, we look at intervals of smaller and smaller, but never zero, length.
Visualizing Velocity: Slope of Curve
Now we visualize velocity using a graph of height. The cornerstone of the idea is the fact that, on
a very small scale, most functions look almost like straight lines. Imagine taking the graph of a
function near a point and “zooming in” to get a close-up view. (See Figure 2.3.) The more we zoom
in, the more the curve appears to be a straight line. We call the slope of this line the slope of the
curve at the point.

Figure 2.3: Estimating the slope of the curve at the point by “zooming in”
To visualize the instantaneous velocity, we think about how we calculated it. We took average
velocities over small intervals containing t = 1. Two such velocities are represented by the slopes
of the lines in Figure 2.4. As the length of the interval shrinks, the slope of the line gets closer to the
slope of the curve at t = 1.

Figure 2.4: Average velocities over small intervals
The instantaneous velocity is the slope of the curve at a point.
Let’s go back to the grapefruit. Figure 2.5 shows the height of the grapefruit plotted against
time. (Note that this is not a picture of the grapefruit’s path, which is straight up and down.)
How can we visualize the average velocity on this graph? Suppose y = s(t). We consider the
interval 1 ≤t ≤2 and the expression
Average velocity = Change in position
Change in time
= s(2) −s(1)
2 −1
= 142 −90
1
= 52 ft/sec.
Now s(2)−s(1) is the change in position over the interval, and it is marked vertically in Figure 2.5.
The 1 in the denominator is the time elapsed and is marked horizontally in Figure 2.5. Therefore,
Average velocity = Change in position
Change in time
= Slope of line joining B and C.
(See Figure 2.5.) A similar argument shows the following:
The average velocity over any time interval a ≤t ≤b is the slope of the line joining the
points on the graph of s(t) corresponding to t = a and t = b.
Figure 2.5 shows how the grapefruit’s velocity varies during its journey. At points A and B
the curve has a large positive slope, indicating that the grapefruit is traveling up rapidly. Point D
is almost at the top: the grapefruit is slowing down. At the peak, the slope of the curve is zero:
the fruit has slowed to zero velocity for an instant in preparation for its return to earth. At point E
the curve has a small negative slope, indicating a slow velocity of descent. Finally, the slope of the
curve at point G is large and negative, indicating a large downward velocity that is responsible for
the “Splat.”

KEY CONCEPT: THE DERIVATIVE
Using Limits to Compute the Instantaneous Velocity
Suppose we want to calculate the instantaneous velocity for s(t) = t2 at t = 3. We must ﬁnd:
lim

s(3 + h) −s(3)
h
= lim
h→0
(3 + h)2 −9
h
.
We show two possible approaches.
Example 3
Estimate lim

(3 + h)2 −9

numerically.
Solution
The limit is the value approached by this expression as h approaches 0. The values in Table 2.2
seem to be converging to 6 as h →0. So it is a reasonable guess that
lim
h→0
(3 + h)2 −9
h
= 6.
However, we cannot be sure that the limit is exactly 6 by looking at the table. To calculate the limit
exactly requires algebra.

Solution
Expanding the numerator gives
(3 + h)2 −9
h
= 9 + 6h + h2 −9
h
= 6h + h2
h
.
Since taking the limit as h →0 means looking at values of h near, but not equal, to 0, we can cancel
h, giving
lim
h→0
(3 + h)2 −9
h
= lim
h→0(6 + h).
As h approaches 0, the values of (6 + h) approach 6, so
lim
h→0
(3 + h)2 −9
h
= lim
h→0(6 + h) = 6.

2.2 THE DERIVATIVE AT A POINT

2.2
THE DERIVATIVE AT A POINT
Average Rate of Change
In Section 2.1, we looked at the change in height divided by the change in time; this ratio is called
the difference quotient. Now we deﬁne the rate of change of a function f that depends on a variable
other than time. We say:
Average rate of change of f
over the interval from a to a + h
=
f(a + h) −f(a)
h
.
The numerator, f(a + h) −f(a), measures the change in the value of f over the interval from a to
a + h. The difference quotient is the change in f divided by the change in the independent variable,
which we call x. Although the interval is no longer necessarily a time interval, we still talk about
the average rate of change of f over the interval. If we want to emphasize the independent variable,
we talk about the average rate of change of f with respect to x.
Instantaneous Rate of Change: The Derivative
We deﬁne the instantaneous rate of change of a function at a point in the same way that we deﬁned
instantaneous velocity: we look at the average rate of change over smaller and smaller intervals.
This instantaneous rate of change is called the derivative of f at a, denoted by f ′(a).
The derivative of f at a, written f ′(a), is deﬁned as
Rate of change
of f at a
= f ′(a) = lim
h→0
f(a + h) −f(a)
h
.
If the limit exists, then f is said to be differentiable at a.
To emphasize that f ′(a) is the rate of change of f(x) as the variable x changes, we call f ′(a) the
derivative of f with respect to x at x = a. When the function y = s(t) represents the position of an
object, the derivative s′(t) is the velocity.
Example 1
Eucalyptus trees, common in California and the Paciﬁc Northwest, grow better with more water.
Scientists in North Africa, analyzing where to plant trees, found that the volume of wood that grows
on a square kilometer, in meters3, is approximated by2
V (r) = 0.2r2 −20r + 600,
where r is rainfall in cm per year, and 60 ≤r ≤120.
(a) Calculate the average rate of change of V with respect to r over the intervals 90 ≤r ≤100 and
100 ≤r ≤110.
(b) By choosing small values for h, estimate the instantaneous rate of change of V with respect to r
at r = 100 cm.
Solution
(a) Using the formula for the average rate of change gives
Average rate of change of volume
for 90 ≤r ≤100
= V (100) −V (90)

= 600 −420

Average rate of change of volume
for 100 ≤r ≤110
= V (110) −V (100)
10
= 820 −600
10
= 22 meter3/cm.
So we see that the average rate of change of the volume of wood grown on a square kilometer
increases as the rainfall increases.
(b) With h = 0.1 and h = −0.1, we have the difference quotients
V (100.1) −V (100)
0.1
= 20.02 m3/cm
and
V (99.9) −V (100)
−0.1
= 19.98 m3/cm.
With h = 0.01 and h = −0.01,
V (100.01) −V (100)
0.01
= 20.002 m3/cm
and
V (99.99) −V (100)
−0.01
= 19.998 m3/cm.
These difference quotients suggest that when the yearly rainfall is 100 cm, the instantaneous
rate of change of the volume of wood grown on a square kilometer is about 20 meter3 per cm
of rainfall. To conﬁrm that the instantaneous rate of change of the function is exactly 20, that is,
V ′(100) = 20, we would need to take the limit as h →0.
Visualizing the Derivative: Slope of Curve and Slope of Tangent
As with velocity, we can visualize the derivative f ′(a) as the slope of the graph of f at x = a.
In addition, there is another way to think of f ′(a). Consider the difference quotient (f(a + h) −
f(a))/h. The numerator, f(a + h) −f(a), is the vertical distance marked in Figure 2.12 and h is
the horizontal distance, so
Average rate of change of f = f(a + h) −f(a)
h
= Slope of line AB.
As h becomes smaller, the line AB approaches the tangent line to the curve at A. (See Figure 2.13.)
We say
Instantaneous rate of change

The derivative at point A can be interpreted as:

• The slope of the tangent line to the curve at A.

2.2 THE DERIVATIVE AT A POINT
85
The slope interpretation is often useful in gaining rough information about the derivative, as the
following examples show.
Example 2
Is the derivative of sin x at x = π positive or negative?
Solution
Looking at a graph of sin x in Figure 2.14 (remember, x is in radians), we see that a tangent line
drawn at x = π has negative slope. So the derivative at this point is negative.

Figure 2.14: Tangent line to sin x at x = π
Recall that if we zoom in on the graph of a function y = f(x) at the point x = a, we usually
ﬁnd that the graph looks like a straight line with slope f ′(a).
Example 3
By zooming in on the point (0, 0) on the graph of the sine function, estimate the value of the
derivative of sin x at x = 0, with x in radians.
Solution
Figure 2.15 shows graphs of sin x with smaller and smaller scales. On the interval −0.1 ≤x ≤0.1,
the graph looks like a straight line of slope 1. Thus, the derivative of sin x at x = 0 is about 1.

Figure 2.15: Zooming in on the graph of sin x near x = 0 shows the derivative is about 1 at x = 0
Later we will show that the derivative of sin x at x = 0 is exactly 1. (See page 152 in Sec-
tion 3.5.) From now on we will assume that this is so. This simple result is one of the reasons we
choose to use radians when doing calculus with trigonometric functions. If we had done Exam-
ple 3 in degrees, the derivative of sin x would have turned out to be a much messier number. (See
Problem 24, page 89.)
Estimating the Derivative
Example 4
Estimate the value of the derivative of f(x) = 2x at x = 0 graphically and numerically.
Solution
Graphically: Figure 2.16 indicates that the graph is concave up. Assuming this, the slope at A is
between the slope of BA and the slope of AC. Since
Slope of line BA = (20 −2−1)
(0 −(−1)) = 1
2
and
Slope of line AC = (21 −20)
(1 −0)
= 1,
we know that at x = 0 the derivative of 2x is between 1/2 and 1.
Numerically: To estimate the derivative at x = 0, we look at values of the difference quotient

The concavity of the curve tells us that difference quotients calculated with negative h’s are
smaller than the derivative, and those calculated with positive h’s are larger. From Table 2.3 we see
that the derivative is between 0.693123 and 0.693171. To three decimal places, f ′(0) = 0.693.
Example 5
Find an approximate equation for the tangent line to f(x) = 2x at x = 0.
Solution
From the previous example, we know the slope of the tangent line is about 0.693. Since the tangent
line has y-intercept 1, its equation is
y = 0.693x + 1.
Computing the Derivative Algebraically
The graph of f(x) = 1/x in Figure 2.17 leads us to expect that f ′(2) is negative. To compute f ′(2)
exactly, we use algebra.

THE DERIVATIVE FUNCTION
In the previous section we looked at the derivative of a function at a ﬁxed point. Now we consider
what happens at a variety of points. The derivative generally takes on different values at different
points and is itself a function.
First, remember that the derivative of a function at a point tells us the rate at which the value of
the function is changing at that point. Geometrically, we can think of the derivative as the slope of
the curve or of the tangent line at the point.

2.3 THE DERIVATIVE FUNCTION

Figure 2.27: Estimating the derivative graphically as the slope of the tangent line
Solution
From the graph we estimate the derivative at any point by placing a straightedge so that it forms the
tangent line at that point, and then using the grid squares to estimate the slope of the straightedge. For
example, the tangent at x = −1 is drawn in Figure 2.27, and has a slope of about 2, so f ′(−1) ≈2.
Notice that the slope at x = −2 is positive and fairly large; the slope at x = −1 is positive
but smaller. At x = 0, the slope is negative, by x = 1 it has become more negative, and so on.
Some estimates of the derivative are listed in Table 2.6. You should check these values. Are they
reasonable? Is the derivative positive where you expect? Negative?

Notice that for every x-value, there’s a corresponding value of the derivative. Therefore, the
derivative is itself a function of x.
For any function f, we deﬁne the derivative function, f ′, by
f ′(x) = Rate of change of f at x = lim
h→0
f(x + h) −f(x)
h
.
For every x-value for which this limit exists, we say f is differentiable at that x-value. If the
limit exists for all x in the domain of f, we say f is differentiable everywhere. Most functions we
meet are differentiable at every point in their domain, except perhaps for a few isolated points.
The Derivative Function: Graphically
Example 2
Sketch the graph of the derivative of the function shown in Figure 2.27.
Solution
We plot the values of the derivative in Table 2.6 and connect them with a smooth curve to obtain
the estimate of the derivative function in Figure 2.28. Values of the derivative function give slopes
of the original graph.

Figure 2.28: Function (colored) and derivative (black) from Example 1
Check that this graph of f ′ makes sense: Where the values of f ′ are positive, f is increasing
(x < −0.3 or x > 3.8) and where f ′ is negative, f is decreasing. Notice that at the points where
f has large positive slope, such as x = −2, the graph of the derivative is far above the x-axis, as it
should be, since the value of the derivative is large there. At points where the slope is gentler, such
as x = −1, the graph of f ′ is closer to the x-axis, since the derivative is smaller.
What Does the Derivative Tell Us Graphically?
Where f ′ is positive, the tangent line to f is sloping up; where f ′ is negative, the tangent line to f
is sloping down. If f ′ = 0 everywhere, then the tangent line to f is horizontal everywhere, and f is
constant. We see that the sign of f ′ tells us whether f is increasing or decreasing.
If f ′ > 0 on an interval, then f is increasing over that interval.
If f ′ < 0 on an interval, then f is decreasing over that interval.
Moreover, the magnitude of the derivative gives us the magnitude of the rate of change; so if f ′ is
large (positive or negative), then the graph of f is steep (up or down), whereas if f ′ is small the
graph of f slopes gently. With this in mind, we can learn about the behavior of a function from the
behavior of its derivative.
The Derivative Function: Numerically
If we are given values of a function instead of its graph, we can estimate values of the derivative.
Example 3
Table 2.7 gives values of c(t), the concentration (μg/cm3) of a drug in the bloodstream at time t
(min). Construct a table of estimated values for c′(t), the rate of change of c(t) with respect to time.

2.3 THE DERIVATIVE FUNCTION
93
Solution
We estimate values of c′ using the values in the table. To do this, we have to assume that the data
points are close enough together that the concentration does not change wildly between them. From
the table, we see that the concentration is increasing between t = 0 and t = 0.4, so we expect a
positive derivative there. However, the increase is quite slow, so we expect the derivative to be small.
The concentration does not change between 0.4 and 0.5, so we expect the derivative to be roughly
0 there. From t = 0.5 to t = 1.0, the concentration starts to decrease, and the rate of decrease gets
larger and larger, so we expect the derivative to be negative and of greater and greater magnitude.
Using the data in the table, we estimate the derivative using the difference quotient:
c′(t) ≈c(t + h) −c(t)
h
.
Since the data points are 0.1 apart, we use h = 0.1, giving, for example,
c′(0) ≈c(0.1) −c(0)
0.1
= 0.89 −0.84
0.1
= 0.5 μg/cm3/min
c′(0.1) ≈c(0.2) −c(0.1)
0.1
= 0.94 −0.89
0.1
= 0.5 μg/cm3/min.
See Table 2.8. Notice that the derivative has small positive values until t = 0.4, where it is roughly
0, and then it gets more and more negative, as we expected. The slopes are graphed in Figure 2.29.

Improving Numerical Estimates for the Derivative
In the previous example, the estimate for the derivative at 0.2 used the interval to the right; we found
the average rate of change between t = 0.2 and t = 0.3. However, we could equally well have gone
to the left and used the rate of change between t = 0.1 and t = 0.2 to approximate the derivative at
0.2. For a more accurate result, we could average these slopes and say
c′(0.2) ≈1

Derivative Function: From a Formula
If we are given a formula for f, can we come up with a formula for f ′? We often can, as shown in
the next example. Indeed, much of the power of calculus depends on our ability to ﬁnd formulas for
the derivatives of all the functions we described earlier. This is done systematically in Chapter 3.

We already know that the slope of a straight line is constant. This tells us that the derivative of a
linear function is constant.
If f(x) = b + mx, then f ′(x) = Slope = m.
Derivative of a Power Function
Example 4
Find a formula for the derivative of f(x) = x2.
Solution
Before computing the formula for f ′(x) algebraically, let’s try to guess the formula by looking for a
pattern in the values of f ′(x). Table 2.9 contains values of f(x) = x2 (rounded to three decimals),
which we can use to estimate the values of f ′(1), f ′(2), and f ′(3).

Near x = 1, the value of x2 increases by about 0.002 each time x increases by 0.001, so
f ′(1) ≈0.002
0.001 = 2.
Similarly, near x = 2 and x = 3, the value of x2 increases by about 0.004 and 0.006, respectively,
when x increases by 0.001. So
f ′(2) ≈0.004
0.001 = 4
and
f ′(3) ≈0.006
0.001 = 6.
Knowing the value of f ′ at speciﬁc points can never tell us the formula for f ′, but it certainly can
be suggestive: Knowing f ′(1) ≈2, f ′(2) ≈4, f ′(3) ≈6 suggests that f ′(x) = 2x.
The derivative is calculated by forming the difference quotient and taking the limit as h goes to
zero. The difference quotient is
f(x + h) −f(x)
h
= (x + h)2 −x2
h
= x2 + 2xh + h2 −x2
h
= 2xh + h2
h
.

2.3 THE DERIVATIVE FUNCTION
95
Since h never actually reaches zero, we can cancel it in the last expression to get 2x + h. The limit
of this as h goes to zero is 2x, so
f ′(x) = lim
h→0(2x + h) = 2x.
Example 5
Calculate f ′(x) if f(x) = x3.
Solution
We look at the difference quotient
f(x + h) −f(x)
h
= (x + h)3 −x3
h
.
Multiplying out gives (x + h)3 = x3 + 3x2h + 3xh2 + h3, so
f ′(x) = lim
h→0
x3 + 3x2h + 3xh2 + h3 −x3
h
= lim
h→0
3x2h + 3xh2 + h3
h
.
Since in taking the limit as h →0, we consider values of h near, but not equal to, zero, we can
cancel h, giving
f ′(x) = lim
h→0
3x2h + 3xh2 + h3
h
= lim
h→0(3x2 + 3xh + h2).
As h →0, the value of (3xh + h2) →0, so
f ′(x) = lim
h→0(3x2 + 3xh + h2) = 3x2.
The previous two examples show how to compute the derivatives of power functions of the form
f(x) = xn, when n is 2 or 3. We can use the Binomial Theorem to show the power rule for a
positive integer n:
If f(x) = xn then f ′(x) = nxn−1.
This result is in fact valid for any real value of n.

2.4
INTERPRETATIONS OF THE DERIVATIVE
We have seen the derivative interpreted as a slope and as a rate of change. In this section, we see
other interpretations. The purpose of these examples is not to make a catalog of interpretations but
to illustrate the process of obtaining them.

2.4 INTERPRETATIONS OF THE DERIVATIVE
99
An Alternative Notation for the Derivative
So far we have used the notation f ′ to stand for the derivative of the function f. An alternative
notation for derivatives was introduced by the German mathematician Wilhelm Gottfried Leibniz
(1646–1716). If the variable y depends on the variable x, that is, if
y = f(x),
then he wrote dy/dx for the derivative, so
dy
dx = f ′(x).
Leibniz’s notation is quite suggestive if we think of the letter d in dy/dx as standing for “small
difference in . . . .” The notation dy/dx reminds us that the derivative is a limit of ratios of the form
Difference in y-values
Difference in x-values.
The notation dy/dx suggests the units for the derivative: the units for y divided by the units for
x. The separate entities dy and dx ofﬁcially have no independent meaning: they are all part of one
notation. In fact, a good way to view the notation dy/dx is to think of d/dx as a single symbol
meaning “the derivative with respect to x of . . ..” So dy/dx can be viewed as
d
dx(y),
meaning “the derivative with respect to x of y.”
On the other hand, many scientists and mathematicians think of dy and dx as separate entities
representing ”inﬁnitesimally” small differences in y and x, even though it is difﬁcult to say exactly
how small “inﬁnitesimal” is. Although not formally correct, it can be helpful to think of dy/dx as a
small change in y divided by a small change in x.
For example, recall that if s = f(t) is the position of a moving object at time t, then v = f ′(t)
is the velocity of the object at time t. Writing
v = ds
dt
reminds us that v is a velocity, since the notation suggests a distance, ds, over a time, dt, and we
know that distance over time is velocity. Similarly, we recognize
dy
dx = f ′(x)
as the slope of the graph of y = f(x) since slope is vertical rise, dy, over horizontal run, dx.
The disadvantage of Leibniz’s notation is that it is awkward to specify the x-value at which we
are evaluating the derivative. To specify f ′(2), for example, we have to write
dy
dx

x=2
.
Using Units to Interpret the Derivative
The following examples illustrate how useful units can be in suggesting interpretations of the deriva-
tive. We use the fact that the units of the instantaneous and the average rate of change are the same.
For example, suppose s = f(t) gives the distance, in meters, of a body from a ﬁxed point as a
function of time, t, in seconds. Then knowing that
ds
dt

t=2
= f ′(2) = 10 meters/sec
tells us that when t = 2 seconds, the body is moving at an instantaneous velocity of 10 meters/sec.
This means that if the body continued to move at this speed for a whole second, it would move 10
meters. In practice, however, the velocity of the body may not remain 10 meters/sec for long. Notice
that the units of instantaneous velocity and of average velocity are the same.

Chapter Two
KEY CONCEPT: THE DERIVATIVE
Example 1
The cost C (in dollars) of building a house A square feet in area is given by the function C = f(A).
What is the practical interpretation of the function f ′(A)?
Solution
In the alternative notation,
f ′(A) = dC
dA.
This is a cost divided by an area, so it is measured in dollars per square foot. You can think of dC
as the extra cost of building an extra dA square feet of house. Then you can think of dC/dA as the
additional cost per square foot. So if you are planning to build a house roughly A square feet in area,
f ′(A) is the cost per square foot of the extra area involved in building a slightly larger house, and
is called the marginal cost. The marginal cost is probably smaller than the average cost per square
foot for the entire house, since once you are already set up to build a large house, the cost of adding
a few square feet is likely to be small.
Example 2
The cost of extracting T tons of ore from a copper mine is C = f(T ) dollars. What does it mean to
say that f ′(2000) = 100?
Solution
In the alternative notation,
f ′(2000) = dC
dT

T =2000
= 100.
Since C is measured in dollars and T is measured in tons, dC/dT must be measured in dollars per
ton. So the statement f ′(2000) = 100 says that when 2000 tons of ore have already been extracted
from the mine, the cost of extracting the next ton is approximately $100.
Example 3
If q = f(p) gives the number of pounds of sugar produced when the price per pound is p dollars,
then what are the units and the meaning of the statement f ′(3) = 50?
Solution
Since f ′(3) is the limit as h →0 of the difference quotient
f(3 + h) −f(3)
h
,
the units of f ′(3) and the difference quotient are the same. Since f(3 + h) −f(3) is in pounds and
h is in dollars, the units of the difference quotient and f ′(3) are pounds/dollar. The statement
f ′(3) = 50 pounds/dollar
tells us that the instantaneous rate of change of q with respect to p is 50 when p = 3. In other
words, when the price is $3, the quantity produced is increasing at 50 pounds/dollar. Thus, if the
price increased by a dollar, the quantity produced would increase by approximately 50 pounds.
Example 4
Water is ﬂowing through a pipe at a constant rate of 10 cubic feet per second. Interpret this rate as
the derivative of some function.
Solution
You might think at ﬁrst that the statement has something to do with the velocity of the water, but in
fact a ﬂow rate of 10 cubic feet per second could be achieved either with very slowly moving water
through a large pipe, or with very rapidly moving water through a narrow pipe. If we look at the
units—cubic feet per second—we realize that we are being given the rate of change of a quantity
measured in cubic feet. But a cubic foot is a measure of volume, so we are being told the rate of
change of a volume. One way to visualize this is to imagine all the water that is ﬂowing through the
pipe ending up in a tank somewhere. Let V (t) be the volume of water in the tank at time t. Then we
are being told that the rate of change of V (t) is 10, or
V ′(t) = dV
dt = 10.

2.4 INTERPRETATIONS OF THE DERIVATIVE
101
Example 5
Let N = g(t) be the estimated number of alternative-fueled vehicles4 in use in the US, in thousands,
where t is the number of years since 1995. Explain the meaning of the statements:
(a)
g′(6) = 38
(b)
g−1(696) = 12
(c)
(g−1)′(696) = 0.0145
Solution
(a) The units of N are thousands of vehicles, the units of t are years, so the units of g′(t) are
thousand vehicles per year. Thus, the statement g′(6) = 38 tells us that in the year 2001, the
use of alternative-fueled vehicles was increasing at 38,000 per year. Thus, in the year between
2001 and 2002, we would have expected the number of alternative-fueled vehicles in use in the
US to increase by about 38,000 vehicles.
(b) The statement g−1(696) = 12, which is equivalent to g(12) = 696, tells us that the year in
which the number of alternative-fueled vehicles was 696,000 was 2007.
(c) The units of (g−1)′(V ) are years per thousand vehicles. The statement (g−1)′(696) = 0.0145
tells us that when the number of alternative-fueled vehicles was 696,000, it took about 0.0145
years, or between 5 and 6 days, for the number of alternative-fueled vehicles to grow by a
thousand vehicles.

shrunk. The ODGI (ozone depleting gas index) shows the
level of CFCs present.8 Let O(t) be the ODGI for Antarc-
tica in year t; then O(2000) = 95 and O′(2000) =

2.5
THE SECOND DERIVATIVE
Since the derivative is itself a function, we can consider its derivative. For a function f, the derivative
of its derivative is called the second derivative, and written f ′′ (read “f double-prime”).If y = f(x),
the second derivative can also be written as d2y
dx2 , which means d
dx
dy
dx

, the derivative of dy
dx.
What Do Derivatives Tell Us?
Recall that the derivative of a function tells you whether a function is increasing or decreasing:
• If f ′ > 0 on an interval, then f is increasing over that interval.
• If f ′ < 0 on an interval, then f is decreasing over that interval.
If f ′ is always positive on an interval or always negative on an interval, then f is monotonic over
that interval.
Since f ′′ is the derivative of f ′,
• If f ′′ > 0 on an interval, then f ′ is increasing over that interval.
• If f ′′ < 0 on an interval, then f ′ is decreasing over that interval.
What does it mean for f ′ to be increasing or decreasing? An example in which f ′ is increasing
is shown in Figure 2.39, where the curve is bending upward, or is concave up. In the example shown
in Figure 2.40, in which f ′ is decreasing, the graph is bending downward, or is concave down. These
ﬁgures suggest the following result:
If f ′′ > 0 on an interval, then f ′ is increasing, so the graph of f is concave up there.
If f ′′ < 0 on an interval, then f ′ is decreasing, so the graph of f is concave down there.

Concave down
Figure 2.40: Meaning of f ′′: The slope of f decreases from left to right, f ′′ is negative, and f is concave down
Warning! The graph of a function f can be concave up everywhere and yet have f ′′ = 0 at
some point. For instance, the graph of f(x) = x4 in Figure 2.41 is concave up, but it can be shown
that f ′′(0) = 0. If we are told that the graph of a function f is concave up, we can be sure that f ′′
is not negative, that is f ′′ ≥0, but not that f ′′ is positive, f ′′ > 0.

If the graph of f is concave up and f ′′ exists on an interval, then f ′′ ≥0 there.
If the graph of f is concave down and f ′′ exists on an interval, then f ′′ ≤0 there.

(c) For t < 0, the graph of h is concave down, so h′′ ≤0 there. For t > 0, the graph of h is concave
up, so h′′ ≥0 there.

Figure 2.44: Graph of f ′′
Solution
We want to sketch the derivative of f ′. We do this by estimating the slopes of f ′ and plotting them,
obtaining Figure 2.44.
We observe that where f ′′ > 0, the graph of f is concave up and f ′ is increasing, and that
where f ′′ < 0, the graph of f is concave down and f ′ is decreasing. Where f ′′(x) = 0, the graph
of f changes from concave up to concave down, and f ′ changes from decreasing to increasing.
Interpretation of the Second Derivative as a Rate of Change
If we think of the derivative as a rate of change, then the second derivative is a rate of change of a
rate of change. If the second derivative is positive, the rate of change of f is increasing; if the second
derivative is negative, the rate of change of f is decreasing.
The second derivative can be a matter of practical concern. A 2009 article11 reported that al-
though the US economy was shrinking, the rate of decrease had slowed. (The derivative of the size of
the economy was negative and the second derivative was positive). The article continued “although
the economy is spiralling down, it is doing so more slowly.”
Example 3
A population, P, growing in a conﬁned environment often follows a logistic growth curve, like that
shown in Figure 2.45. Relate the sign of d2P/dt2 to how the rate of growth, dP/dt, changes over
time. What are practical interpretations of t0 and L?
t0
L

P
Figure 2.45: Logistic growth curve
Solution
For t < t0, the rate of growth, dP/dt, is increasing and d2P/dt2 ≥0. At t0, the rate dP/dt is a
maximum. In other words, at time t0 the population is growing fastest. For t > t0, the rate of growth,
dP/dt, is decreasing and dP 2/dt2 ≤0. At t0, the curve changes from concave up to concave down,
and d2P/dt2 = 0 there.

(a) For each time interval we can calculate the average rate of change of velocity. For example,
from t = 0 to t = 3 we have
dv

3 −0 = 7.67 m/sec

Estimated values of dv/dt are in Table 2.11.
(b) Since the values of dv/dt are decreasing between the points shown, we expect d2v/dt2 ≤0.
The graph of v against t in Figure 2.46 supports this; it is concave down. The fact that dv/dt > 0
tells us that the car is speeding up; the fact that d2v/dt2 ≤0 tells us that the rate of increase
decreased (actually, did not increase) over this time period.

Velocity and Acceleration
When a car is speeding up, we say that it is accelerating. We deﬁne acceleration as the rate of
change of velocity with respect to time. If v(t) is the velocity of an object at time t, we have
Average acceleration
from t to t + h
= v(t + h) −v(t)
h
,
Instantaneous acceleration = v′(t) = lim
h→0
v(t + h) −v(t)

.
If the term velocity or acceleration is used alone, it is assumed to be instantaneous. Since velocity
is the derivative of position, acceleration is the second derivative of position. Summarizing:

Chapter Two
KEY CONCEPT: THE DERIVATIVE
If y = s(t) is the position of an object at time t, then
• Velocity: v(t) = dy
dt = s′(t).
• Acceleration: a(t) = d2y
dt2 = s′′(t) = v′(t).
Example 5
A particle is moving along a straight line; its acceleration is zero only once. Its distance, s, to the
right of a ﬁxed point is given by Figure 2.47. Estimate:
(a) When the particle is moving to the right and when it is moving to the left.
(b) When the acceleration of the particle is zero, when it is negative, and when it is positive.

Figure 2.47: Distance of particle to right of a ﬁxed point
Solution
(a) The particle is moving to the right whenever s is increasing. From the graph, this appears to be
for 0 < t < 2
3 and for t > 2. For 2
3 < t < 2, the value of s is decreasing, so the particle is
moving to the left.
(b) Since the acceleration is zero only once, this must be when the curve changes concavity, at
about t = 4
3. Then the acceleration is negative for t < 4
3, since the graph is concave down there,
and the acceleration is positive for t > 4
3, since the graph is concave up there.

DIFFERENTIABILITY
What Does It Mean for a Function to Be Differentiable?
A function is differentiable at a point if it has a derivative there. In other words:
The function f is differentiable at x if
lim
h→0
f(x + h) −f(x)
h
exists.
Thus, the graph of f has a nonvertical tangent line at x. The value of the limit and the slope
of the tangent line are the derivative of f at x.

Chapter Two
KEY CONCEPT: THE DERIVATIVE
Occasionally we meet a function which fails to have a derivative at a few points. A function
fails to be differentiable at a point if:
• The function is not continuous at the point.
• The graph has a sharp corner at that point.
• The graph has a vertical tangent line.
Figure 2.55 shows a function which appears to be differentiable at all points except x = a and
x = b. There is no tangent at A because the graph has a corner there. As x approaches a from the
left, the slope of the line joining P to A converges to some positive number. As x approaches a from
the right, the slope of the line joining P to A converges to some negative number. Thus the slopes
approach different numbers as we approach x = a from different sides. Therefore the function is
not differentiable at x = a. At B, the graph has a vertical tangent. As x approaches b, the slope of
the line joining B to Q does not approach a limit; it just keeps growing larger and larger. Again, the
limit deﬁning the derivative does not exist and the function is not differentiable at x = b.

Examples of Nondifferentiable Functions
An example of a function whose graph has a corner is the absolute value function deﬁned as follows:
f(x) = |x| =
 x
if x ≥0,
−x
if x < 0.
This function is called piecewise linear because each part of it is linear. Its graph is in Figure 2.56.
Near x = 0, even close-up views of the graph of f(x) look the same, so this is a corner which can’t
be straightened out by zooming in.
Example 1
Try to compute the derivative of the function f(x) = |x| at x = 0. Is f differentiable there?
Solution
To ﬁnd the derivative at x = 0, we want to look at
lim
h→0
f(h) −f(0)
h
= lim
h→0
|h| −0
h
= lim
h→0
|h|
h .
As h approaches 0 from the right, h is positive, so |h| = h, and the ratio is always 1. As h approaches
0 from the left, h is negative, so |h| = −h, and the ratio is −1. Since the limits are different from
each side, the limit of the difference quotient does not exist. Thus, the absolute value function is not
differentiable at x = 0. The limits of 1 and −1 correspond to the fact that the slope of the right-hand
part of the graph is 1, and the slope of the left-hand part is −1.
Example 2
Investigate the differentiability of f(x) = x1/3 at x = 0.
Solution
This function is smooth at x = 0 (no sharp corners) but appears to have a vertical tangent there.
(See Figure 2.57.) Looking at the difference quotient at x = 0, we see
lim

(0 + h)1/3 −01/3

As h →0 the denominator becomes small, so the fraction grows without bound. Hence, the function
fails to have a derivative at x = 0.
Example 3
Consider the function given by the formulas
g(x) =
 x + 1
if
x ≤1
3x −1
if
x > 1.
Draw the graph of g. Is g continuous? Is g differentiable at x = 1?
Solution
The graph in Figure 2.58 has no breaks in it, so the function is continuous. However, the graph has
a corner at x = 1 which no amount of magniﬁcation will remove. To the left of x = 1, the slope is
1; to the right of x = 1, the slope is 3. Thus, the difference quotient at x = 1 has no limit, so the
function g is not differentiable at x = 1.
The Relationship Between Differentiability and Continuity
The fact that a function which is differentiable at a point has a tangent line suggests that the function
is continuous there, as the next theorem shows.
Theorem 2.1: A Differentiable Function Is Continuous
If f(x) is differentiable at a point x = a, then f(x) is continuous at x = a.
Proof We assume f is differentiable at x = a. Then we know that f ′(a) exists where
f ′(a) = lim
x→a
f(x) −f(a)
x −a
.
To show that f is continuous at x = a, we want to show that limx→a f(x) = f(a). We calculate
limx→a(f(x) −f(a)), hoping to get 0. By algebra, we know that for x ̸= a,
f(x) −f(a) = (x −a) · f(x) −f(a)
x −a
.
Taking the limits, we have
lim
x→a(f(x) −f(a)) = lim
x→a


=

lim

·

lim

f(x) −f(a)
x −a

(By Theorem 1.2, Property 3)
= 0 · f ′(a) = 0.
(Since f ′(a) exists)
Thus we know that lim
x→a f(x) = f(a), which means f(x) is continuous at x = a.

56. In April 1991, the Economist carried an article18 which
said:
Suddenly, everywhere, it is not the rate of
change of things that matters, it is the rate of
change of rates of change. Nobody cares much
about inﬂation; only whether it is going up or
down. Or rather, whether it is going up fast
or down fast. “Inﬂation drops by disappointing
two points,” cries the billboard. Which roughly
translated means that prices are still rising, but
less fast than they were, though not quite as
much less fast as everybody had hoped.
In the last sentence, there are three statements about
prices. Rewrite these as statements about derivatives.

Derivative of a Constant Times a Function
Figure 3.1 shows the graph of y = f(x) and of three multiples: y = 3f(x), y =
1
2f(x), and
y = −2f(x). What is the relationship between the derivatives of these functions? In other words,
for a particular x-value, how are the slopes of these graphs related?

Figure 3.1: A function and its multiples: Derivative of multiple is multiple of derivative
Multiplying the value of a function by a constant stretches or shrinks the original graph (and
reﬂects it across the x-axis if the constant is negative). This changes the slope of the curve at each
point. If the graph has been stretched, the “rises” have all been increased by the same factor, whereas
the “runs” remain the same. Thus, the slopes are all steeper by the same factor. If the graph has been
shrunk, the slopes are all smaller by the same factor. If the graph has been reﬂected across the x-
axis, the slopes will all have their signs reversed. In other words, if a function is multiplied by a
constant, c, so is its derivative:
Theorem 3.1: Derivative of a Constant Multiple
If f is differentiable and c is a constant, then
d
dx [cf(x)] = cf ′(x).
Proof Although the graphical argument makes the theorem plausible, to prove it we must use the deﬁnition
of the derivative:
d
dx [cf(x)] = lim
h→0
cf(x + h) −cf(x)
h
= lim
h→0 c f(x + h) −f(x)
h
= c lim
h→0
f(x + h) −f(x)
h
= cf ′(x).
We can take c across the limit sign by the properties of limits (part 1 of Theorem 1.2 on page 60).
Derivatives of Sums and Differences
Suppose we have two functions, f(x) and g(x), with the values listed in Table 3.1. Values of the
sum f(x) + g(x) are given in the same table.

We see that adding the increments of f(x) and the increments of g(x) gives the increments of
f(x) + g(x). For example, as x increases from 0 to 1, f(x) increases by 10 and g(x) increases by
0.2, while f(x)+g(x) increases by 110.2−100 = 10.2. Similarly, as x increases from 3 to 4, f(x)
increases by 40 and g(x) by 0.2, while f(x) + g(x) increases by 200.8 −160.6 = 40.2.
From this example, we see that the rate at which f(x)+g(x) is increasing is the sum of the rates
at which f(x) and g(x) are increasing. Similar reasoning applies to the difference, f(x) −g(x). In
terms of derivatives:
Theorem 3.2: Derivative of Sum and Difference
If f and g are differentiable, then
d
dx [f(x) + g(x)] = f ′(x) + g′(x)
and
d
dx [f(x) −g(x)] = f ′(x) −g′(x).
Proof Using the deﬁnition of the derivative:
d
dx [f(x) + g(x)] = lim
h→0
[f(x + h) + g(x + h)] −[f(x) + g(x)]

⎥⎥⎦
= f ′(x) + g′(x).
We have used the fact that the limit of a sum is the sum of the limits, part 2 of Theorem 1.2 on
page 60. The proof for f(x) −g(x) is similar.
Powers of x
In Chapter 2 we showed that
f ′(x) = d
dx(x2) = 2x
and
g′(x) = d
dx(x3) = 3x2.
The graphs of f(x) = x2 and g(x) = x3 and their derivatives are shown in Figures 3.2 and 3.3.
Notice f ′(x) = 2x has the behavior we expect. It is negative for x < 0 (when f is decreasing),
zero for x = 0, and positive for x > 0 (when f is increasing). Similarly, g′(x) = 3x2 is zero when
x = 0, but positive everywhere else, as g is increasing everywhere else.

These examples are special cases of the power rule, which we justify for any positive integer n
on page 127:
The Power Rule
For any constant real number n,
d
dx(xn) = nxn−1.
Problem 80 asks you to show that this rule holds for negative integral powers; such powers can also
be differentiated using the quotient rule (Section 3.3). In Section 3.6 we indicate how to justify the
power rule for powers of the form 1/n.

Justification of d
dx (xn) = nxn−1, for n a Positive Integer
To calculate the derivatives of x2 and x3, we had to expand (x + h)2 and (x + h)3. To calculate the
derivative of xn, we must expand (x + h)n. Let’s look back at the previous expansions:
(x + h)2 = x2 + 2xh + h2,
(x + h)3 = x3 + 3x2h + 3xh2 + h3,
and multiply out a few more examples:
(x + h)4 = x4 + 4x3h + 6x2h2 + 4xh3 + h4,
(x + h)5 = x5 + 5x4h + 10x3h2 + 10x2h3 + 5xh4 + h5.

Terms involving h2 and higher powers of h
In general, we can say
(x + h)n = xn + nxn−1h + · · · + hn.


	
Terms involving h2 and higher powers of h
We have just seen this is true for n = 2, 3, 4, 5. It can be proved in general using the Binomial
Theorem (see www.wiley.com/college/hughes-hallett). Now to ﬁnd the derivative,
d
dx(xn) = lim

When we factor out h from terms involving h2 and higher powers of h, each term will still have an
h in it. Factoring and dividing, we get:

h

These terms go to 0

Derivatives of Polynomials

any polynomial.

Example 5
Find the second derivative and interpret its sign for
(a)
f(x) = x2,
(b)
g(x) = x3,
(c)
k(x) = x1/2.
Solution
(a) If f(x) = x2, then f ′(x) = 2x, so f ′′(x) =
d
dx(2x) = 2. Since f ′′ is always positive, f is
concave up, as expected for a parabola opening upward. (See Figure 3.5.)
(b) If g(x) = x3, then g′(x) = 3x2, so g′′(x) =
d
dx(3x2) = 3 d
dx(x2) = 3 · 2x = 6x. This is
positive for x > 0 and negative for x < 0, which means x3 is concave up for x > 0 and concave
down for x < 0. (See Figure 3.6.)
(c) If k(x) = x1/2, then k′(x) = 1

Now k′ and k′′ are only deﬁned on the domain of k, that is, x ≥0. When x > 0, we see that
k′′(x) is negative, so k is concave down. (See Figure 3.7.)

Example 6
If the position of a body, in meters, is given as a function of time t, in seconds, by
s = −4.9t2 + 5t + 6,
ﬁnd the velocity and acceleration of the body at time t.

3.1 POWERS AND POLYNOMIALS
129
Solution
The velocity, v, is the derivative of the position:
v = ds
dt = d
dt(−4.9t2 + 5t + 6) = −9.8t + 5,
and the acceleration, a, is the derivative of the velocity:
a = dv
dt = d
dt(−9.8t + 5) = −9.8.
Note that v is in meters/second and a is in meters/second2.

Figure 3.9: Derivative of the cubic of Example 7
Solution
Graphical approach: Suppose we move along the curve from left to right. To the left of A, the slope
is positive; it starts very positive and decreases until the curve reaches A, where the slope is 0.
Between A and C the slope is negative. Between A and B the slope is decreasing (getting more
negative); it is most negative at B. Between B and C the slope is negative but increasing; at C the
slope is zero. From C to the right, the slope is positive and increasing. The graph of the derivative
function is shown in Figure 3.9.
Algebraic approach: f is a cubic that goes to +∞as x →+∞, so
f(x) = ax3 + bx2 + cx + d
with a > 0. Hence,
f ′(x) = 3ax2 + 2bx + c,
whose graph is a parabola opening upward, as in Figure 3.9.

What do we expect the graph of the derivative of the exponential function f(x) = ax to look like?
The exponential function in Figure 3.10 increases slowly for x < 0 and more rapidly for x > 0, so
the values of f ′ are small for x < 0 and larger for x > 0. Since the function is increasing for all
values of x, the graph of the derivative must lie above the x-axis. It appears that the graph of f ′ may
resemble the graph of f itself.

f(x) = ax
Figure 3.10: f(x) = ax, with a > 1
In this section we see that f ′(x) = k · ax, where k is a constant, so in fact f ′(x) is propor-
tional to f(x). This property of exponential functions makes them particularly useful in modeling
because many quantities have rates of change which are proportional to themselves. For example,
the simplest model of population growth has this property.
Derivatives of Exponential Functions and the Number e
We start by calculating the derivative of g(x) = 2x, which is given by
g′(x) = lim

2x+h −2x

2x2h −2x

· 2x.
(Since x and 2x are ﬁxed during this calculation).
To ﬁnd limh→0(2h −1)/h, see Table 3.2 where we have substituted values of h near 0. The table
suggests that the limit exists and has value 0.693. Let us call the limit k, so k = 0.693. Then
d
dx(2x) = k · 2x = 0.693 · 2x.
So the derivative of 2x is proportional to 2x with constant of proportionality 0.693. A similar calcu-
lation shows that the derivative of f(x) = ax is
f ′(x) = lim

The quantity limh→0(ah −1)/h is also a constant, although the value of the constant depends
on a. Writing k = limh→0(ah −1)/h, we see that the derivative of f(x) = ax is proportional to ax:

3.2 THE EXPONENTIAL FUNCTION
133
d
dx(ax) = k · ax.
For particular values of a, we can estimate k by substituting values of h near 0 into the expres-
sion (ah −1)/h. Table 3.3 shows the results. Notice that for a = 2, the value of k is less than 1,
while for a = 3, 4, 5, . . ., the values of k are greater than 1. The values of k appear to be increasing,
so we guess that there is a value of a between 2 and 3 for which k = 1. If so, we have found a value
of a with the remarkable property that the function ax is equal to its own derivative.
So let us look for such an a. This means we want to ﬁnd a such that
lim
h→0
ah −1
h
= 1,
or, for small h,
ah −1
h
≈1.
Solving for a, we can estimate a as follows:
ah −1 ≈h,
or
ah ≈1 + h,
so
a ≈(1 + h)1/h.
Taking small values of h, as in Table 3.4, we see a ≈2.718 . . .. This is the number e introduced
in Chapter 1. In fact, it can be shown that if
e = lim
h→0(1 + h)1/h = 2.718 . . .
then
lim
h→0
eh −1
h
= 1.
This means that ex is its own derivative:
d
dx(ex) = ex.
Figure 3.11 shows the graphs 2x, 3x, and ex together with their derivatives. Notice that the
derivative of 2x is below the graph of 2x, since k < 1 there, and the graph of the derivative of 3x
is above the graph of 3x, since k > 1 there. With e ≈2.718, the function ex and its derivative are
identical.
Note on Round-Off Error and Limits
If we try to evaluate (1 + h)1/h on a calculator by taking smaller and smaller values of h, the values
of (1+h)1/h at ﬁrst get closer to 2.718 . . .. However, they will eventually move away again because
of the round-off error (that is, errors introduced by the fact that the calculator can only hold a certain
number of digits).
As we try smaller and smaller values of h, how do we know when to stop? Unfortunately, there
is no ﬁxed rule. A calculator can only suggest the value of a limit, but can never conﬁrm that this
value is correct. In this case, it looks like the limit is 2.718 . . . because the values of (1 + h)1/h
approach this number for a while. To be sure this is correct, we have to ﬁnd the limit analytically.

A Formula for the Derivative of ax
To get a formula for the derivative of ax, we must calculate

However, without knowing the value of a, we can’t use a calculator to estimate k. We take a different
approach, rewriting a = eln a, so
lim
h→0
ah −1
h
= lim
h→0
(eln a)h −1
h
= lim
h→0
e(ln a)h −1
h
.
To evaluate this limit, we use a limit that we already know:
lim
h→0
eh −1
h
= 1.
In order to use this limit, we substitute t = (ln a)h. Since t approaches 0 as h approaches 0, we
have
lim
h→0
e(ln a)h −1
h
= lim
t→0


ax = (ln a)ax.
In Section 3.6 we obtain the same result by another method. We conclude that:
d
dx(ax) = (ln a)ax.
Thus, for any a, the derivative of ax is proportional to ax. The constant of proportionality is ln a. The
derivative of ax is equal to ax if the constant of proportionality is 1, that is, if ln a = 1, then a = e.
The fact that the constant of proportionality is 1 when a = e makes e a particularly convenient base
for exponential functions.
Example 1
Differentiate 2 · 3x + 5ex.
Solution
d
dx(2 · 3x + 5ex) = 2 d
dx(3x) + 5 d
dx(ex) = 2 ln 3 · 3x + 5ex ≈(2.1972)3x + 5ex.
We can now use the new differentiation formula to compute rates.
Example 2
The population of the world in billions can be modeled by the function f(t) = 6.91(1.011)t, where
t is years since 2010. Find and interpret f(0) and f ′(0).
Solution
We have f(t) = 6.91(1.011)t so f ′(t) = 6.91(ln 1.011)(1.011)t = 0.0756(1.011)t. Therefore,
f(0) = 6.91 billion people
and
f ′(0) = 0.0756 billion people per year.
In 2010, the population of the world was 6.91 billion people and was increasing at a rate of 0.0756
billion, or 75.6 million, people per year.

THE PRODUCT AND QUOTIENT RULES
We now know how to ﬁnd derivatives of powers and exponentials, and of sums and constant multi-
ples of functions. This section shows how to ﬁnd the derivatives of products and quotients.
Using Δ Notation
To express the difference quotients of general functions, some additional notation is helpful. We
write Δf, read “delta f,” for a small change in the value of f at the point x,
Δf = f(x + h) −f(x).
In this notation, the derivative is the limit of the ratio Δf/h:
f ′(x) = lim
h→0
Δf
h .
The Product Rule
Suppose we know the derivatives of f(x) and g(x) and want to calculate the derivative of the
product, f(x)g(x). The derivative of the product is calculated by taking the limit, namely,
d[f(x)g(x)]
dx
= lim
h→0
f(x + h)g(x + h) −f(x)g(x)
h
.
To picture the quantity f(x + h)g(x + h) −f(x)g(x), imagine the rectangle with sides f(x + h)
and g(x + h) in Figure 3.13, where Δf = f(x + h) −f(x) and Δg = g(x + h) −g(x). Then
f(x + h)g(x + h) −f(x)g(x) = (Area of whole rectangle) −(Unshaded area)
= Area of the three shaded rectangles
= Δf · g(x) + f(x) · Δg + Δf · Δg.

Now divide by h:

Figure 3.13: Illustration for the product rule (with Δf, Δg positive)
To evaluate the limit as h →0, we examine the three terms on the right separately. Notice that
lim
h→0
Δf
h · g(x) = f ′(x)g(x)
and
lim
h→0 f(x) · Δg
h = f(x)g′(x).
In the third term we multiply the top and bottom by h to get Δf

h · h. Then,
lim

Thus we have proved the following rule:
Theorem 3.3: The Product Rule
If u = f(x) and v = g(x) are differentiable, then
(fg)′ = f ′g + fg′.
The product rule can also be written
d(uv)
dx
= du
dx · v + u · dv
dx.
In words:
The derivative of a product is the derivative of the ﬁrst times the second plus the ﬁrst
times the derivative of the second.
Another justiﬁcation of the product rule is given in Problem 41 on page 174.

The Quotient Rule
Suppose we want to differentiate a function of the form Q(x) = f(x)/g(x). (Of course, we have to
avoid points where g(x) = 0.) We want a formula for Q′ in terms of f ′ and g′.
Assuming that Q(x) is differentiable, we can use the product rule on f(x) = Q(x)g(x):
f ′(x) = Q′(x)g(x) + Q(x)g′(x)
= Q′(x)g(x) + f(x)
g(x) g′(x).
Solving for Q′(x) gives
Q′(x) =
f ′(x) −f(x)
g(x) g′(x)
g(x)

Multiplying the top and bottom by g(x) to simplify gives

to invest the proceeds. If the picture is sold between the
years 2000 and 2020 and the money from the sale is in-
vested in a bank account earning 5% interest per year
compounded annually, then B(t), the balance in the year
2020, depends on the year, t, in which the painting is
sold and the sale price P(t). If t is measured from the

3.4
THE CHAIN RULE
The chain rule enables us to differentiate composite functions such as
√
x2 + 1 or e−x2. Before
seeing a formula, let’s think about the derivative of a composite function in a practical situation.
Intuition Behind the Chain Rule
Imagine we are moving straight upward in a hot air balloon. Let y be our distance from the ground.
The temperature, H, is changing as a function of altitude, so H = f(y). How does our temperature
change with time?
The rate of change of our temperature is affected both by how fast the temperature is chang-
ing with altitude (about 16◦F per mile), and by how fast we are climbing (say 2 mph). Then our
temperature changes by 16◦for every mile we climb, and since we move 2 miles in an hour, our
temperature changes by 16 · 2 = 32 degrees in an hour.
Since temperature is a function of height, H = f(y), and height is a function of time, y = g(t),
we can think of temperature as a composite function of time, H = f(g(t)), with f as the outside
function and g as the inside function. The example suggests the following result, which turns out to
be true:
Rate of change
of composite function
=
Rate of change
of outside function
×
Rate of change
of inside function
The Derivative of a Composition of Functions
We now obtain a formula for the chain rule. Suppose f(g(x)) is a composite function, with f being
the outside function and g being the inside. Let us write
z = g(x)
and
y = f(z),
so
y = f(g(x)).
Then a small change in x, called Δx, generates a small change in z, called Δz. In turn, Δz generates
a small change in y called Δy. Provided Δx and Δz are not zero, we can say:
Δy
Δx = Δy
Δz · Δz
Δx.
Since dy
dx = lim
Δx→0
Δy
Δx, this suggests that in the limit as Δx, Δy, and Δz get smaller and smaller,
we have:

3.4 THE CHAIN RULE
143
The Chain Rule
dy
dx = dy
dz · dz
dx.
In other words:
The rate of change of a composite function is the product of the rates of change of
the outside and inside functions.
Since dy
dz = f ′(z) and dz
dx = g′(x), we can also write
d
dxf(g(x)) = f ′(z) · g′(x).
Substituting z = g(x), we can rewrite this as follows:
Theorem 3.5: The Chain Rule
If f and g are differentiable functions, then
d
dxf(g(x)) = f ′(g(x)) · g′(x).
In words:
The derivative of a composite function is the product of the derivatives of the outside
and inside functions. The derivative of the outside function must be evaluated at the
inside function.
A justiﬁcation of the chain rule is given in Problem 42 on page 175. The following example shows
how units conﬁrm that the rate of change of a composite function is the product of the rates of
change of the outside and inside functions.
Example 1
The length, L, in micrometers (μm), of steel depends on the air temperature, H◦C, and the tempera-
ture H depends on time, t, measured in hours. If the length of a steel bridge increases by 0.2 μm for
every degree increase in temperature, and the temperature is increasing at 3◦C per hour, how fast is
the length of the bridge increasing? What are the units for your answer?
Solution
We want to know how much the length of the bridge changes in one hour; this rate is in μm/hr.
We are told that the length of the bridge changes by 0.2 μm for each degree that the temperature
changes, and that the temperature changes by 3◦C each hour. Thus, in one hour, the length of the
bridge changes by 0.2 · 3 = 0.6 μm.
Now we do the same calculation using derivative notation and the chain rule. We know that
Rate length increasing with respect to temperature = dL
dH = 0.2 μm/◦C
Rate temperature increasing with respect to time = dH
dt = 3◦C/hr.
We want to calculate the rate at which the length is increasing with respect to time, or dL/dt. We
think of L as a function of H, and H as a function of t. The chain rule tells us that
dL
dt = dL
dH · dH
dt =

0.2μm
◦C

·

3
◦C
hr

= 0.6 μm/hr.
Thus, the length is increasing at 0.6 μm/hr. Notice that the units work out as we expect.
Example 1 shows us how to interpret the chain rule in practical terms. The next examples show
how the chain rule is used to compute derivatives of functions given by formulas.

(b)
√
3x2 + 5x −2
(c)
1

(d)

(e)

Solution
(a) Here z = g(x) = x2 + 1 is the inside function; f(z) = z100 is the outside function. Now
g′(x) = 2x and f ′(z) = 100z99, so
d
dx((x2 + 1)100) = 100z99 · 2x = 100(x2 + 1)99 · 2x = 200x(x2 + 1)99.
(b) Here z = g(x) = 3x2 + 5x −2 and f(z) = √z, so g′(x) = 6x + 5 and f ′(z) =
1
2√z . Hence
d

3x2 + 5x −2) =

2√z · (6x + 5) =

√
3x2 + 5x −2
· (6x + 5).
(c) Let z = g(x) = x2 + x4 and f(z) = 1/z, so g′(x) = 2x + 4x3 and f ′(z) = −z−2 = −1
z2 .
Then
d

z2 (2x + 4x3) = −2x + 4x3
(x2 + x4)2 .
We could have done this problem using the quotient rule. Try it and see that you get the same
answer!
(d) Let z = g(x) = 3x and f(z) = ez. Then g′(x) = 3 and f ′(z) = ez, so
d
dx

e3x
= ez · 3 = 3e3x.
(e) To ﬁgure out which is the inside function and which is the outside, notice that to evaluate
ex2 we ﬁrst evaluate x2 and then take e to that power. This tells us that the inside function is
z = g(x) = x2 and the outside function is f(z) = ez. Therefore, g′(x) = 2x, and f ′(z) = ez,
giving
d
dx(ex2) = ez · 2x = ex2 · 2x = 2xex2.
To differentiate a complicated function, we may have to use the chain rule more than once, as
in the following example.
Example 3
Differentiate: (a)
√

(b)

Solution
(a) Let z = g(x) = e−x/7 + 5 be the inside function; let f(z) = √z be the outside function. Now
f ′(z) =
1
2√z , but we need the chain rule to ﬁnd g′(x).
We choose inside and outside functions whose composition is g(x). Let u = h(x) = −x/7
and k(u) = eu + 5 so g(x) = k(h(x)) = e−x/7 + 5. Then h′(x) = −1/7 and k′(u) = eu, so
g′(x) = eu ·

(b) Let z = g(t) = 1 −e2
√
t be the inside function and f(z) = z19 be the outside function. Then
f ′(z) = 19z18 but we need the chain rule to differentiate g(t).

3.4 THE CHAIN RULE
145
Now we choose u = h(t) = 2
√
t and k(u) = 1 −eu, so g(t) = k(h(t)). Then h′(t) =
2 · 1
2t−1/2 = 1

t and k′(u) = −eu, so
g′(t) = −eu · 1

t = −e2

Using the Product and Chain Rules to Differentiate a Quotient
If you prefer, you can differentiate a quotient by the product and chain rules, instead of by the
quotient rule. The resulting formulas may look different, but they will be equivalent.
Example 6
Find k′(x) if k(x) =
x
x2 + 1.
Solution
One way is to use the quotient rule:
k′(x) = 1 · (x2 + 1) −x · (2x)
(x2 + 1)2
=
1 −x2
(x2 + 1)2 .

146
Chapter Three SHORT-CUTS TO DIFFERENTIATION
Alternatively, we can write the original function as a product,
k(x) = x
1
x2 + 1 = x · (x2 + 1)−1,
and use the product rule:
k′(x) = 1 · (x2 + 1)−1 + x · d
dx
"
(x2 + 1)−1#
.
Now use the chain rule to differentiate (x2 + 1)−1, giving
d
dx
"
(x2 + 1)−1#
= −(x2 + 1)−2 · 2x =
−2x
(x2 + 1)2 .
Therefore,
k′(x) =
1
x2 + 1 + x ·
−2x
(x2 + 1)2 =
1
x2 + 1 −
2x2
(x2 + 1)2 .
Putting these two fractions over a common denominator gives the same answer as the quotient rule.

THE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS
Derivatives of the Sine and Cosine
Since the sine and cosine functions are periodic, their derivatives must be periodic also. (Why?) Let’s
look at the graph of f(x) = sin x in Figure 3.22 and estimate the derivative function graphically.

First we might ask where the derivative is zero. (At x = ±π/2, ±3π/2, ±5π/2, etc.) Then ask
where the derivative is positive and where it is negative. (Positive for −π/2 < x < π/2; negative
for π/2 < x < 3π/2, etc.) Since the largest positive slopes are at x = 0, 2π, and so on, and the
largest negative slopes are at x = π, 3π, and so on, we get something like the graph in Figure 3.23.

The graph of the derivative in Figure 3.23 looks suspiciously like the graph of the cosine func-
tion. This might lead us to conjecture, quite correctly, that the derivative of the sine is the cosine.

150
Chapter Three SHORT-CUTS TO DIFFERENTIATION
Of course, we cannot be sure, just from the graphs, that the derivative of the sine really is the
cosine. However, for now we’ll assume that the derivative of the sine is the cosine and conﬁrm the
result at the end of the section.
One thing we can do now is to check that the derivative function in Figure 3.23 has amplitude
1 (as it ought to if it is the cosine). That means we have to convince ourselves that the derivative of
f(x) = sin x is 1 when x = 0. The next example suggests that this is true when x is in radians.
Example 1
Using a calculator set in radians, estimate the derivative of f(x) = sin x at x = 0.
Solution
Since f(x) = sin x,
f ′(0) = lim
h→0
sin(0 + h) −sin 0
h
= lim

sin h

.
Table 3.5 contains values of (sin h)/h which suggest that this limit is 1, so we estimate
f ′(0) = lim

= 1.

Warning: It is important to notice that in the previous example h was in radians; any conclusions
we have drawn about the derivative of sin x are valid only when x is in radians. If you ﬁnd the
derivative with h in degrees, you get a different result.
Example 2
Starting with the graph of the cosine function, sketch a graph of its derivative.
Solution
The graph of g(x) = cos x is in Figure 3.24(a). Its derivative is 0 at x = 0, ±π, ±2π, and so on; it is
positive for −π < x < 0, π < x < 2π, and so on; and it is negative for 0 < x < π, 2π < x < 3π,
and so on. The derivative is in Figure 3.24(b).

As we did with the sine, we use the graphs to make a conjecture. The derivative of the cosine in
Figure 3.24(b) looks exactly like the graph of sine, except reﬂected across the x-axis. But how can
we be sure that the derivative is −sin x?
Example 3
Use the relation d
dx(sin x) = cos x to show that d
dx(cos x) = −sin x.
Solution
Since the cosine function is the sine function shifted to the left by π/2 (that is, cos x = sin (x + π/2)),
we expect the derivative of the cosine to be the derivative of the sine, shifted to the left by π/2. Dif-

But cos(x + π/2) is the cosine shifted to the left by π/2, which gives a sine curve reﬂected across
the x-axis. So we have

x + π

= −sin x.
At the end of this section and in Problems 66 and 67, we show that our conjectures for the
derivatives of sin x and cos x are correct. Thus, we have:
For x in radians,
d
dx(sin x) = cos x
and
d
dx(cos x) = −sin x.

Example 6
The Bay of Fundy in Canada is known for extreme tides. The depth of the water, y, in meters can
be modeled as a function of time, t, in hours after midnight, by
y = 10 + 7.5 cos(0.507t).
How quickly is the depth of the water rising or falling at 6:00 am and at 9:00 am?
Solution
To ﬁnd how fast the water depth is changing, we compute the derivative of y, using the chain rule:
dy
dt = −7.5(0.507) sin(0.507t) = −3.8025 sin(0.507t).
When t = 6, we have dy
dt = −3.8025 sin(0.507 · 6) = −0.378 meters/hour. So the tide is
falling at 0.378 meters/hour.
When t = 9, we have dy
dt = −3.8025 sin(0.507 · 9) = 3.760 meters/hour. So the tide is rising
at 3.760 meters/hour.
Informal Justification of
d
dx (sin x) = cos x
Consider the unit circle in Figure 3.26. To ﬁnd the derivative of sin x, we need to estimate
sin(x + h) −sin x
h
.
In Figure 3.26, the quantity sin(x + h) −sin x is represented by the length QA. The arc QP is of
length h, so
sin(x + h) −sin x
h
=
QA
Arc QP .
Now, if h is small, QAP is approximately a right triangle because the arc QP is almost a straight
line. Furthermore, using geometry, we can show that angle AQP = x + h. For small h, we have
sin(x + h) −sin x
h
=
QA
Arc QP ≈cos(x + h).

65. A wave travels along a string that is joined to a thicker

f(x) = cos(k1x −wt) + R cos(−k1x −wt)
and the wave along the rope, given by x > 0, is
g(x) = T cos(k2x −wt).
For every value of t, the two waves have the same tan-
gent line at x = 0, so they have the same value and same
slope at x = 0. Use this fact to show that
R = k1 −k2

THE CHAIN RULE AND INVERSE FUNCTIONS
In this section we will use the chain rule to calculate the derivatives of fractional powers, logarithms,
exponentials, and the inverse trigonometric functions.5 The same method is used to obtain a formula
for the derivative of a general inverse function.
Finding the Derivative of an Inverse Function: Derivative of x1/2
Earlier we calculated the derivative of xn with n an integer, but we have been using the result
for non-integer values of n as well. We now conﬁrm that the power rule holds for n = 1/2 by
calculating the derivative of f(x) = x1/2 using the chain rule. Since
(f(x))2 = x,
the derivative of (f(x))2 and the derivative of x must be equal, so
d
dx (f(x))2 = d
dx(x).
We can use the chain rule with f(x) as the inside function to obtain:
d
dx(f(x))2 = 2f(x) · f ′(x) = 1.
Solving for f ′(x) gives
f ′(x) =
1
2f(x) =
1
2x1/2 ,
or
d
dx(x1/2) =
1
2x1/2 = 1
2x−1/2.
A similar calculation can be used to obtain the derivative of x1/n where n is a positive integer.
Derivative of ln x
We use the chain rule to differentiate an identity involving ln x. Since eln x = x, we have
d
dx(eln x) = d
dx(x),
eln x · d
dx(ln x) = 1.
(Since ex is outside function and ln x is inside function)
Solving for d(ln x)/dx gives
d
dx(ln x) =
1
eln x = 1
x,
so
d
dx(ln x) = 1
x.
Example 1

dx(x2 + 1) =

x2 + 1.
(b) Using the product rule:
d
dt(t2 ln t) = d
dt(t2) · ln t + t2 d
dt(ln t) = 2t ln t + t2 · 1
t = 2t ln t + t.
5It requires a separate justiﬁcation, not given here, that these functions are differentiable.

Derivative of ax
In Section 3.2, we saw that the derivative of ax is proportional to ax. Now we see another way of
calculating the constant of proportionality. We use the identity
ln(ax) = x ln a.
Differentiating both sides, using d
dx(ln x) = 1
x and the chain rule, and remembering that ln a is a
constant, we obtain:
d
dx(ln ax) = 1
ax · d
dx(ax) = ln a.
Solving gives the result we obtained earlier:
d
dx(ax) = (ln a)ax.
Derivatives of Inverse Trigonometric Functions
In Section 1.5 we deﬁned arcsinx as the angle between −π/2 and π/2 (inclusive) whose sine
is x. Similarly, arctanx as the angle strictly between −π/2 and π/2 whose tangent is x. To ﬁnd
d
dx(arctan x) we use the identity tan(arctan x) = x. Differentiating using the chain rule gives
1
cos2(arctan x) · d
dx(arctan x) = 1,
so
d
dx(arctan x) = cos2(arctan x).
Using the identity 1 + tan2 θ =
1
cos2 θ, and replacing θ by arctan x, we have
cos2(arctan x) =
1
1 + tan2(arctan x) =
1
1 + x2 .
Thus we have
d
dx(arctan x) =
1
1 + x2 .

Derivative of a General Inverse Function
Each of the previous results gives the derivative of an inverse function. In general, if a function f
has a differentiable inverse, f −1, we ﬁnd its derivative by differentiating f(f −1(x)) = x by the
chain rule:
d
dx

f

f −1(x)

= 1
f ′ 
f −1(x)

· d
dx

f −1(x)

= 1
so
d
dx

f −1(x)

=
1
f ′(f −1(x)).
Thus, the derivative of the inverse is the reciprocal of the derivative of the original function, but
evaluated at the point f −1(x) instead of the point x.
Example 3
Figure 3.29 shows f(x) and f −1(x). Using Table 3.6, ﬁnd
(a) (i)
f(2)
(ii)

(iii)

(b) The equation of the tangent lines at the points P and Q.
(c) What is the relationship between the two tangent lines?

Solution

(ii) f −1(2) = 1.

3.6 THE CHAIN RULE AND INVERSE FUNCTIONS
159
(iii) f ′(2) = 2.8.
(iv) To ﬁnd the derivative of the inverse function, we use
(f −1)′(2) =
1
f ′(f −1(2)) =
1
f ′(1) = 1
1.4 = 0.714.
Notice that the derivative of f −1 is the reciprocal of the derivative of f. However, the
derivative of f −1 is evaluated at 2, while the derivative of f is evaluated at 1, where
f −1(2) = 1 and f(1) = 2.
(b) At the point P, we have f(3) = 8 and f ′(3) = 5.5, so the equation of the tangent line at P is
y −8 = 5.5(x −3).
At the point Q, we have f −1(8) = 3, so the slope at Q is
(f −1)′(8) =
1
f ′(f −1(8)) =
1
f ′(3) = 1
5.5.
Thus, the equation of the tangent line at Q is
y −3 = 1
5.5(x −8).
(c) The two tangent lines have reciprocal slopes, and the points (3, 8) and (8, 3) are reﬂections of
one another in the line y = x. Thus, the two tangent lines are reﬂections of one another in the
line y = x.

IMPLICIT FUNCTIONS
In earlier chapters, most functions were written in the form y = f(x); here y is said to be an explicit
function of x. An equation such as
x2 + y2 = 4
is said to give y as an implicit function of x. Its graph is the circle in Figure 3.35. Since there are
x-values which correspond to two y-values, y is not a function of x on the whole circle. Solving
gives
y = ±

4 −x2,
where y =
√
4 −x2 represents the top half of the circle and y = −
√
4 −x2 represents the bottom
half. So y is a function of x on the top half, and y is a different function of x on the bottom half.
But let’s consider the circle as a whole. The equation does represent a curve which has a tangent
line at each point. The slope of this tangent can be found by differentiating the equation of the circle
with respect to x:
d
dx(x2) + d
dx(y2) = d
dx(4).
If we think of y as a function of x and use the chain rule, we get
2x + 2y dy
dx = 0.
Solving gives

The derivative here depends on both x and y (instead of just on x). This is because for many x-
values there are two y-values, and the curve has a different slope at each one. Figure 3.35 shows
that for x and y both positive, we are on the top right quarter of the curve and the slope is negative

(as the formula predicts). For x positive and y negative, we are on the bottom right quarter of the
curve and the slope is positive (as the formula predicts).
Differentiating the equation of the circle has given us the slope of the curve at all points except
(2, 0) and (−2, 0), where the tangent is vertical. In general, this process of implicit differentiation
leads to a derivative whenever the expression for the derivative does not have a zero in the denomi-
nator.
Example 1
Make a table of x and approximate y-values for the equation y3 −xy = −6 near x = 7, y = 2.
Your table should include the x-values 6.8, 6.9, 7.0, 7.1, and 7.2.
Solution
We would like to solve for y in terms of x, but we cannot isolate y by factoring. There is a formula
for solving cubics, somewhat like the quadratic formula, but it is too complicated to be useful here.
Instead, ﬁrst observe that x = 7, y = 2 does satisfy the equation. (Check this!) Now ﬁnd dy/dx by
implicit differentiation:
d
dx(y3) −d
dx(xy) = d
dx(−6)
3y2 dy
dx −1 · y −xdy
dx = 0
(Differentiating with respect to x)

(See Figure 3.36.) The equation of the tangent line at (7, 2) is
y −2 = 2
5(x −7)
or
y = 0.4x −0.8.
Since the tangent lies very close to the curve near the point (7, 2), we use the equation of the tangent
line to calculate the following approximate y-values:

Notice that although the equation y3 −xy = −6 leads to a curve which is difﬁcult to deal with
algebraically, it still looks like a straight line locally.
Example 2
Find all points where the tangent line to y3 −xy = −6 is either horizontal or vertical.
Solution
From the previous example, dy
dx =
y
3y2 −x. The tangent is horizontal when the numerator of dy/dx
equals 0, so y = 0. Since we also must satisfy y3 −xy = −6, we get 03 −x · 0 = −6, which is
impossible. We conclude that there are no points on the curve where the tangent line is horizontal.
The tangent is vertical when the denominator of dy/dx is 0, giving 3y2−x = 0. Thus, x = 3y2
at any point with a vertical tangent line. Again, we must also satisfy y3 −xy = −6, so
y3 −(3y2)y = −6,
−2y3 = −6,
y =
3√
3 ≈1.442.

164
Chapter Three SHORT-CUTS TO DIFFERENTIATION
We can then ﬁnd x by substituting y =
3√
3 in y3 −xy = −6. We get 3 −x(
3√
3) = −6, so
x = 9/(
3√
3) ≈6.240. So the tangent line is vertical at (6.240, 1.442).
Using implicit differentiation and the expression for dy/dx to locate the points where the tan-
gent is vertical or horizontal, as in the previous example, is a ﬁrst step in obtaining an overall picture
of the curve y3 −xy = −6. However, ﬁlling in the rest of the graph, even roughly, by using the sign
of dy/dx to tell us where the curve is increasing or decreasing can be difﬁcult.

HYPERBOLIC FUNCTIONS
There are two combinations of ex and e−x which are used so often in engineering that they are
given their own name. They are the hyperbolic sine, abbreviated sinh, and the hyperbolic cosine,
abbreviated cosh. They are deﬁned as follows:
Hyperbolic Functions
cosh x = ex + e−x
2
sinh x = ex −e−x
2
Properties of Hyperbolic Functions
The graphs of cosh x and sinh x are given in Figures 3.37 and 3.38 together with the graphs of
multiples of ex and e−x. The graph of cosh x is called a catenary; it is the shape of a hanging cable.

166
Chapter Three SHORT-CUTS TO DIFFERENTIATION
cosh 0 = 1
sinh 0 = 0
cosh(−x) = cosh x
sinh(−x) = −sinh x
To show that the hyperbolic functions really do have these properties, we use their formulas.
Example 1
Show that (a) cosh(0) = 1
(b) cosh(−x) = cosh x
Solution
(a) Substituting x = 0 into the formula for cosh x gives
cosh 0 = e0 + e−0
2
= 1 + 1
2
= 1.
(b) Substituting −x for x gives
cosh(−x) = e−x + e−(−x)
2
= e−x + ex
2
= cosh x.
Thus, we know that cosh x is an even function.
Example 2
Describe and explain the behavior of cosh x as x →∞and x →−∞.
Solution
From Figure 3.37, it appears that as x →∞, the graph of cosh x resembles the graph of 1
2ex.
Similarly, as x →−∞, the graph of cosh x resembles the graph of 1
2e−x. This behavior is explained
by using the formula for cosh x and the facts that e−x →0 as x →∞and ex →0 as x →−∞:
As x →∞,
cosh x = ex + e−x
2
→1
2ex.
As x →−∞,
cosh x = ex + e−x
2
→1
2e−x.
Identities Involving cosh x and sinh x
The reason the hyperbolic functions have names that remind us of the trigonometric functions is
that they share similar properties. A familiar identity for trigonometric functions is
(cos x)2 + (sin x)2 = 1.
To discover an analogous identity relating (cosh x)2 and (sinh x)2, we ﬁrst calculate
(cosh x)2 =
ex + e−x
2
2
= e2x + 2exe−x + e−2x
4
= e2x + 2 + e−2x
4
(sinh x)2 =
ex −e−x
2
2
= e2x −2exe−x + e−2x
4
= e2x −2 + e−2x
4
.
If we add these expressions, the resulting right-hand side contains terms involving both e2x and
e−2x. If, however, we subtract the expressions for (cosh x)2 and (sinh x)2, we obtain a simple
result:
(cosh x)2 −(sinh x)2 = e2x + 2 + e−2x
4
−e2x −2 + e−2x
4
= 4
4 = 1.
Thus, writing cosh2 x for (cosh x)2 and sinh2 x for (sinh x)2, we have the identity
cosh2 x −sinh2 x = 1
This identity shows us how the hyperbolic functions got their name. Suppose (x, y) is a point
in the plane and x = cosh t and y = sinh t for some t. Then the point (x, y) lies on the hyperbola
x2 −y2 = 1.

The Hyperbolic Tangent
Extending the analogy to the trigonometric functions, we deﬁne
tanh x = sinh x
cosh x = ex −e−x
ex + e−x
Derivatives of Hyperbolic Functions
We calculate the derivatives using the fact that d
dx(ex) = ex. The results are again reminiscent of
the trigonometric functions. For example,
d
dx(cosh x) = d

LINEAR APPROXIMATION AND THE DERIVATIVE
The Tangent Line Approximation
When we zoom in on the graph of a differentiable function, it looks like a straight line. In fact, the
graph is not exactly a straight line when we zoom in; however, its deviation from straightness is so
small that it can’t be detected by the naked eye. Let’s examine what this means. The straight line that
we think we see when we zoom in on the graph of f(x) at x = a has slope equal to the derivative,
f ′(a), so the equation is
y = f(a) + f ′(a)(x −a).
The fact that the graph looks like a line means that y is a good approximation to f(x). (See Fig-
ure 3.40.) This suggests the following deﬁnition:
The Tangent Line Approximation
Suppose f is differentiable at a. Then, for values of x near a, the tangent line approximation
to f(x) is
f(x) ≈f(a) + f ′(a)(x −a).
The expression f(a) + f ′(a)(x −a) is called the local linearization of f near x = a. We are
thinking of a as ﬁxed, so that f(a) and f ′(a) are constant.
The error, E(x), in the approximation is deﬁned by
E(x) = f(x) −f(a) −f ′(a)(x −a).
It can be shown that the tangent line approximation is the best linear approximation to f near a. See
Problem 43.

If f(x) = sin x, then f ′(x) = cos x, so f(0) = sin 0 = 0 and f ′(0) = cos 0 = 1, and the
approximation is
sin x ≈x.
This means that, near x = 0, the function f(x) = sin x is well approximated by the function y = x.
If we zoom in on the graphs of the functions sin x and x near the origin, we won’t be able to tell
them apart. (See Figure 3.41.)

Example 2
What is the local linearization of ekx near x = 0?
Solution
If f(x) = ekx, then f(0) = 1 and, by the chain rule, f ′(x) = kekx, so f ′(0) = kek·0 = k. Thus
f(x) ≈f(0) + f ′(0)(x −0)
becomes
ekx ≈1 + kx.
This is the tangent line approximation to ekx near x = 0. In other words, if we zoom in on the
functions f(x) = ekx and y = 1 + kx near the origin, we won’t be able to tell them apart.
Estimating the Error in the Approximation
Let us look at the error, E(x), which is the difference between f(x) and the local linearization.
(Look back at Figure 3.40.) The fact that the graph of f looks like a line as we zoom in means that
not only is E(x) small for x near a, but also that E(x) is small relative to (x −a). To demonstrate
this, we prove the following theorem about the ratio E(x)/(x −a).
Theorem 3.6: Differentiability and Local Linearity
Suppose f is differentiable at x = a and E(x) is the error in the tangent line approximation,
that is:
E(x) = f(x) −f(a) −f ′(a)(x −a).
Then
lim
x→a
E(x)
x −a = 0.
Proof Using the deﬁnition of E(x), we have
E(x)
x −a = f(x) −f(a) −f ′(a)(x −a)
x −a
= f(x) −f(a)
x −a
−f ′(a).
Taking the limit as x →a and using the deﬁnition of the derivative, we see that
lim
x→a
E(x)
x −a = lim
x→a
f(x) −f(a)
x −a
−f ′(a)

= f ′(a) −f ′(a) = 0.
Theorem 3.6 says that E(x) approaches 0 faster than (x −a). For the function in Example 3,
we see that E(x) ≈k(x −a)2 for constant k if x is near a.
Example 3
Let E(x) be the error in the tangent line approximation to f(x) = x3 −5x + 3 for x near 2.
(a) What does a table of values for E(x)/(x −2) suggest about limx→2 E(x)/(x −2)?

3.9 LINEAR APPROXIMATION AND THE DERIVATIVE
171
(b) Make another table to see that E(x) ≈k(x−2)2. Estimate the value of k. Check that a possible
value is k = f ′′(2)/2.
Solution
(a) Since f(x) = x3 −5x + 3, we have f ′(x) = 3x2 −5, and f ′′(x) = 6x. Thus, f(2) = 1 and
f ′(2) = 3 · 22 −5 = 7, so the tangent line approximation for x near 2 is
f(x) ≈f(2) + f ′(2)(x −2)
f(x) ≈1 + 7(x −2).
Thus,
E(x) = True value −Approximation = (x3 −5x + 3) −(1 + 7(x −2)).
The values of E(x)/(x −2) in Table 3.7 suggest that E(x)/(x −2) approaches 0 as x →2.
(b) Notice that if E(x) ≈k(x −2)2, then E(x)/(x −2)2 ≈k. Thus we make Table 3.8 showing
values of E(x)/(x −2)2. Since the values are all approximately 6, we guess that k = 6 and
E(x) ≈6(x −2)2.
Since f ′′(2) = 12, our value of k satisﬁes k = f ′′(2)/2.

The relationship between E(x) and f ′′(x) that appears in Example 3 holds more generally. If
f(x) satisﬁes certain conditions, it can be shown that the error in the tangent line approximation
behaves near x = a as
E(x) ≈f ′′(a)

This is part of a general pattern for obtaining higher-order approximations called Taylor polynomi-
als, which are studied in Chapter 10.
Why Differentiability Makes a Graph Look Straight
We use the properties of the error E(x) to understand why differentiability makes a graph look
straight when we zoom in.
Example 4
Consider the graph of f(x) = sin x near x = 0, and its linear approximation computed in Exam-
ple 1. Show that there is an interval around 0 with the property that the distance from f(x) = sin x
to the linear approximation is less than 0.1|x| for all x in the interval.
Solution
The linear approximation of f(x) = sin x near 0 is y = x, so we write
sin x = x + E(x).
Since sin x is differentiable at x = 0, Theorem 3.6 tells us that
lim
x→0
E(x)
x
= 0.
If we take ϵ = 1/10, then the deﬁnition of limit guarantees that there is a δ > 0 such that

We can generalize from this example to explain why differentiability makes the graph of f look
straight when viewed over a small graphing window. Suppose f is differentiable at x = a. Then we
know lim
x→a

E(x)
x −a
 = 0. So, for any ϵ > 0, we can ﬁnd a δ small enough so that

E(x)

for
a −δ < x < a + δ.
So, for any x in the interval (a −δ, a + δ), we have
|E(x)| < ϵ|x −a|.
Thus, the error, E(x), is less than ϵ times |x −a|, the distance between x and a. So, as we zoom in
on the graph by choosing smaller ϵ, the deviation, |E(x)|, of f from its tangent line shrinks, even
relative to the scale on the x-axis. So, zooming makes a differentiable function look straight.

THEOREMS ABOUT DIFFERENTIABLE FUNCTIONS
A Relationship Between Local and Global: The Mean Value Theorem
We often want to infer a global conclusion (for example, f is increasing on an interval) from local
information (for example, f ′ is positive at each point on an interval). The following theorem relates
the average rate of change of a function on an interval (global information) to the instantaneous rate
of change at a point in the interval (local information).
Theorem 3.7: The Mean Value Theorem
If f is continuous on a ≤x ≤b and differentiable on a < x < b, then there exists a number
c, with a < c < b, such that
f ′(c) = f(b) −f(a)
b −a
.
In other words, f(b) −f(a) = f ′(c)(b −a).
To understand this theorem geometrically, look at Figure 3.44. Join the points on the curve
where x = a and x = b with a secant line and observe that
Slope of secant line = f(b) −f(a)
b −a
.
Now consider the tangent lines drawn to the curve at each point between x = a and x = b. In
general, these lines have different slopes. For the curve shown in Figure 3.44, the tangent line at

176
Chapter Three SHORT-CUTS TO DIFFERENTIATION
x = a is ﬂatter than the secant line. Similarly, the tangent line at x = b is steeper than the secant
line. However, there appears to be at least one point between a and b where the slope of the tangent
line to the curve is precisely the same as the slope of the secant line. Suppose this occurs at x = c.
Then
Slope of tangent line = f ′(c) = f(b) −f(a)
b −a
.
The Mean Value Theorem tells us that the point x = c exists, but it does not tell us how to ﬁnd c.
Problems 44 and 45 in Section 4.2 show how the Mean Value Theorem can be derived.

If f satisﬁes the conditions of the Mean Value Theorem on a < x < b and f(a) = f(b) = 0,
the Mean Value Theorem tells us that there is a point c, with a < c < b, such that f ′(c) = 0. This
result is called Rolle’s Theorem.
The Increasing Function Theorem
We say that a function f is increasing on an interval if, for any two numbers x1 and x2 in the
interval such that x1 < x2, we have f(x1) < f(x2). If instead we have f(x1) ≤f(x2), we say f is
nondecreasing.
Theorem 3.8: The Increasing Function Theorem
Suppose that f is continuous on a ≤x ≤b and differentiable on a < x < b.
• If f ′(x) > 0 on a < x < b, then f is increasing on a ≤x ≤b.
• If f ′(x) ≥0 on a < x < b, then f is nondecreasing on a ≤x ≤b.
Proof Suppose a ≤x1 < x2 ≤b. By the Mean Value Theorem, there is a number c, with x1 < c < x2,
such that
f(x2) −f(x1) = f ′(c)(x2 −x1).
If f ′(c) > 0, this says f(x2) −f(x1) > 0, which means f is increasing. If f ′(c) ≥0, this says
f(x2) −f(x1) ≥0, which means f is nondecreasing.
It may seem that something as simple as the Increasing Function Theorem should follow imme-
diately from the deﬁnition of the derivative, and you may be surprised that the Mean Value Theorem
is needed.
The Constant Function Theorem
If f is constant on an interval, then we know that f ′(x) = 0 on the interval. The following theorem
is the converse.

3.10 THEOREMS ABOUT DIFFERENTIABLE FUNCTIONS
177
Theorem 3.9: The Constant Function Theorem
Suppose that f is continuous on a ≤x ≤b and differentiable on a < x < b. If f ′(x) = 0 on
a < x < b, then f is constant on a ≤x ≤b.
Proof The proof is the same as for the Increasing Function Theorem, only in this case f ′(c) = 0 so
f(x2) −f(x1) = 0. Thus f(x2) = f(x1) for a ≤x1 < x2 ≤b, so f is constant.
A proof of the Constant Function Theorem using the Increasing Function Theorem is given in
Problems 17 and 25.
The Racetrack Principle
Theorem 3.10: The Racetrack Principle9
Suppose that g and h are continuous on a ≤x ≤b and differentiable on a < x < b, and that
g′(x) ≤h′(x) for a < x < b.
• If g(a) = h(a), then g(x) ≤h(x) for a ≤x ≤b.
• If g(b) = h(b), then g(x) ≥h(x) for a ≤x ≤b.
The Racetrack Principle has the following interpretation. We can think of g(x) and h(x) as the
positions of two racehorses at time x, with horse h always moving faster than horse g. If they start
together, horse h is ahead during the whole race. If they ﬁnish together, horse g was ahead during
the whole race.
Proof Consider the function f(x) = h(x) −g(x). Since f ′(x) = h′(x) −g′(x) ≥0, we know that f is
nondecreasing by the Increasing Function Theorem. So f(x) ≥f(a) = h(a) −g(a) = 0. Thus
g(x) ≤h(x) for a ≤x ≤b. This proves the ﬁrst part of the Racetrack Principle. Problem 24 asks
for a proof of the second part.
Example 1
Explain graphically why ex ≥1 + x for all values of x. Then use the Racetrack Principle to prove
the inequality.
Solution
The graph of the function y = ex is concave up everywhere and the equation of its tangent line at
the point (0, 1) is y = x + 1. (See Figure 3.45.) Since the graph always lies above its tangent, we
have the inequality
ex ≥1 + x.

Then g(0) = h(0) = 1. Furthermore, g′(x) = 1 and h′(x) = ex. Hence g′(x) ≤h′(x) for x ≥0.
So by the Racetrack Principle, with a = 0, we have g(x) ≤h(x), that is, 1 + x ≤ex.
For x ≤0 we have h′(x) ≤g′(x). So by the Racetrack Principle, with b = 0, we have
g(x) ≤h(x), that is, 1 + x ≤ex.

Exercises
In Exercises 1–5, decide if the statements are true or false.
Give an explanation for your answer.
1. Let f(x) = [x], the greatest integer less than or equal to
x. Then f ′(x) = 0, so f(x) is constant by the Constant
Function Theorem.
2. If a < b and f ′(x) is positive on [a, b] then f(a) < f(b).
3. If f(x) is increasing and differentiable on the interval
[a, b], then f ′(x) > 0 on [a, b].
4. The Racetrack Principle can be used to justify the state-
ment that if two horses start a race at the same time, the
horse that wins must have been moving faster than the
other throughout the race.
5. Two horses start a race at the same time and one runs
slower than the other throughout the race. The Racetrack
Principle can be used to justify the fact that the slower
horse loses the race.

In Problems 19–22, use one of the theorems in this section to
prove the statements .

f(t) ≤3
2t2 for all t ≥0.
21. If f ′(x) = g′(x) for all x and f(5) = g(5), then

7 for 0 ≤t ≤2. What can we say about the position
f(2) of the particle at t = 2?
24. Suppose that g and h are continuous on [a, b] and dif-
ferentiable on (a, b). Prove that if g′(x) ≤h′(x) for
a < x < b and g(b) = h(b), then h(x) ≤g(x) for
a ≤x ≤b.
25. Deduce the Constant Function Theorem from the In-
creasing Function Theorem and the Decreasing Function
Theorem. (See Problem 17.)
26. Prove that if f ′(x) = g′(x) for all x in (a, b), then
there is a constant C such that f(x) = g(x) + C on
(a, b). [Hint: Apply the Constant Function Theorem to
h(x) = f(x) −g(x).]
27. Suppose that f′(x) = f(x) for all x. Prove that f(x) =
Cex for some constant C. [Hint: Consider f(x)/ex.]
28. Suppose that f is continuous on [a, b] and differentiable
on (a, b) and that m ≤f ′(x) ≤M on (a, b). Use
the Racetrack Principle to prove that f(x) −f(a) ≤
M(x −a) for all x in [a, b], and that m(x −a) ≤
f(x) −f(a) for all x in [a, b]. Conclude that m ≤
(f(b) −f(a))/(b −a) ≤M. This is called the Mean
Value Inequality. In words: If the instantaneous rate of
change of f is between m and M on an interval, so is the
average rate of change of f over the interval.
29. Suppose that f′′(x) ≥0 for all x in (a, b). We will show
the graph of f lies above the tangent line at (c, f(c)) for
any c with a < c < b.
(a) Use the Increasing Function Theorem to prove that
f ′(c) ≤f ′(x) for c ≤x < b and that f ′(x) ≤
f ′(c) for a < x ≤c.
(b) Use (a) and the Racetrack Principle to conclude that
f(c) + f ′(c)(x −c) ≤f(x), for a < x < b.

USING FIRST AND SECOND DERIVATIVES
What Derivatives Tell Us About a Function and Its Graph
As we saw in Chapter 2, the connection between derivatives of a function and the function itself is
given by the following:
• If f ′ > 0 on an interval, then f is increasing on that interval.
• If f ′ < 0 on an interval, then f is decreasing on that interval.
If f ′ is always positive on an interval or always negative on an interval, then f is monotonic over
that interval.
• If f ′′ > 0 on an interval, then the graph of f is concave up on that interval.
• If f ′′ < 0 on an interval, then the graph of f is concave down on that interval.
We can do more with these principles now than we could in Chapter 2 because we now have formu-
las for the derivatives of the elementary functions.
When we graph a function on a computer or calculator, we often see only part of the picture,
and we may miss some signiﬁcant features. Information given by the ﬁrst and second derivatives
can help identify regions with interesting behavior.
Example 1
Use the ﬁrst and second derivatives to analyze the function f(x) = x3 −9x2 −48x + 52.
Solution
Since f is a cubic polynomial, we expect a graph that is roughly S-shaped. We can use the derivative
to determine where the function is increasing and where it is decreasing. The derivative of f is
f ′(x) = 3x2 −18x −48.
To ﬁnd where f ′ > 0 or f ′ < 0, we ﬁrst ﬁnd where f ′ = 0, that is, where 3x2 −18x −48 = 0.
Factoring, we get 3(x + 2)(x −8) = 0, so x = −2 or x = 8. Since f ′ = 0 only at x = −2 and
x = 8, and since f ′ is continuous, f ′ cannot change sign on any of the three intervals x < −2, or
−2 < x < 8, or 8 < x. How can we tell the sign of f ′ on each of these intervals? One way is to
pick a point and substitute into f ′. For example, since f ′(−3) = 33 > 0, we know f ′ is positive for
x < −2, so f is increasing for x < −2. Similarly, since f ′(0) = −48 and f ′(10) = 72, we know
that f decreases between x = −2 and x = 8 and increases for x > 8. Summarizing:
f ′ = 0
x = −2
f ′ = 0
x = 8
f ′ > 0
f increasing ↗
f ′ < 0
f decreasing ↘
f ′ > 0
f increasing ↗
x
We ﬁnd that f(−2) = 104 and f(8) = −396. Hence on the interval −2 < x < 8 the function
decreases from a high of 104 to a low of −396. One more point on the graph is easy to get: the y
intercept, f(0) = 52. With just these three points we can get a graph. See Figure 4.1.
In Figure 4.1, we see that part of the graph is concave up and part is concave down. We can use
the second derivative to analyze concavity. We have
f ′′(x) = 6x −18.
Thus, f ′′(x) < 0 when x < 3 and f ′′(x) > 0 when x > 3, so the graph of f is concave down for
x < 3 and concave up for x > 3. At x = 3, we have f ′′(x) = 0. See Figure 4.1. Summarizing:

Local Maxima and Minima
We are often interested in points such as those marked local maximum and local minimum in Fig-
ure 4.1. We have the following deﬁnition:
Suppose p is a point in the domain of f:
• f has a local minimum at p if f(p) is less than or equal to the values of f for points near
p.
• f has a local maximum at p if f(p) is greater than or equal to the values of f for points
near p.
We use the adjective “local” because we are describing only what happens near p. Local max-
ima and minima are sometimes called local extrema.
How Do We Detect a Local Maximum or Minimum?
In the preceding example, the points x = −2 and x = 8, where f ′(x) = 0, played a key role in
leading us to local maxima and minima. We give a name to such points:
For any function f, a point p in the domain of f where f ′(p) = 0 or f ′(p) is undeﬁned is
called a critical point of the function. In addition, the point (p, f(p)) on the graph of f is
also called a critical point. A critical value of f is the value, f(p), at a critical point, p.
Notice that “critical point of f” can refer either to points in the domain of f or to points on the graph
of f. You will know which meaning is intended from the context.
Geometrically, at a critical point where f ′(p) = 0, the line tangent to the graph of f at p is
horizontal. At a critical point where f ′(p) is undeﬁned, there is no horizontal tangent to the graph—
there’s either a vertical tangent or no tangent at all. (For example, x = 0 is a critical point for the
absolute value function f(x) = |x|.) However, most of the functions we work with are differentiable
everywhere, and therefore most of our critical points are of the f ′(p) = 0 variety.
The critical points divide the domain of f into intervals within which the sign of the derivative
remains the same, either positive or negative. Therefore, if f is deﬁned on the interval between two
successive critical points, its graph cannot change direction on that interval; it is either increasing
or decreasing. The following result, which is proved on page 192, tells us that all local maxima and
minima which are not at endpoints occur at critical points.

188
Chapter Four USING THE DERIVATIVE
Theorem 4.1: Local Extrema and Critical Points
Suppose f is deﬁned on an interval and has a local maximum or minimum at the point x = a,
which is not an endpoint of the interval. If f is differentiable at x = a, then f ′(a) = 0. Thus,
a is a critical point.
Warning! Not every critical point is a local maximum or local minimum. Consider f(x) = x3,
which has a critical point at x = 0. (See Figure 4.2.) The derivative, f ′(x) = 3x2, is positive on
both sides of x = 0, so f increases on both sides of x = 0, and there is neither a local maximum
nor a local minimum at x = 0.

Testing for Local Maxima and Minima at a Critical Point
If f ′ has different signs on either side of a critical point p, with f ′(p) = 0, then the graph changes
direction at p and looks like one of those in Figure 4.3. So we have the following criterion:
The First-Derivative Test for Local Maxima and Minima
Suppose p is a critical point of a continuous function f. Moving from left to right:
• If f ′ changes from negative to positive at p, then f has a local minimum at p.
• If f ′ changes from positive to negative at p, then f has a local maximum at p.

Example 2
Use a graph of the function f(x) =
1
x(x −1) to observe its local maxima and minima. Conﬁrm
your observation analytically.
Solution
The graph in Figure 4.4 suggests that this function has no local minima but that there is a local
maximum at about x = 1
2. Conﬁrming this analytically means using the formula for the derivative
to show that what we expect is true. Since f(x) = (x2 −x)−1, we have
f ′(x) = −1(x2 −x)−2(2x −1) = −2x −1
(x2 −x)2 .
So f ′(x) = 0 where 2x −1 = 0. Thus, the only critical point in the domain of f is x = 1
2.

4.1 USING FIRST AND SECOND DERIVATIVES
189
Furthermore, f ′(x) > 0 where 0 < x < 1/2, and f ′(x) < 0 where 1/2 < x < 1. Thus, f
increases for 0 < x < 1/2 and decreases for 1/2 < x < 1. According to the ﬁrst derivative test, the
critical point x = 1/2 is a local maximum.
For −∞< x < 0 or 1 < x < ∞, there are no critical points and no local maxima or minima.
Although 1/(x(x −1)) →0 both as x →∞and as x →−∞, we don’t say 0 is a local minimum
because 1/ (x(x −1)) never actually equals 0.
Notice that although f ′ > 0 everywhere that it is deﬁned for x < 1/2, the function f is not
increasing throughout this interval. The problem is that f and f ′ are not deﬁned at x = 0, so we
cannot conclude that f is increasing when x < 1/2.

Example 3
The graph of f(x) = sin x + 2ex is in Figure 4.5. Using the derivative, explain why there are no
local maxima or minima for x ≥0.
Solution
Local maxima and minima can occur only at critical points. Now f ′(x) = cos x + 2ex, which is
deﬁned for all x. We know cos x is always between −1 and 1, and 2ex ≥2 for x ≥0, so f ′(x)
cannot be 0 for any x ≥0. Therefore there are no local maxima or minima there.
The Second-Derivative Test for Local Maxima and Minima
Knowing the concavity of a function can also be useful in testing if a critical point is a local maxi-
mum or a local minimum. Suppose p is a critical point of f, with f ′(p) = 0, so that the graph of f
has a horizontal tangent line at p. If the graph is concave up at p, then f has a local minimum at p.
Likewise, if the graph is concave down, f has a local maximum. (See Figure 4.6.) This suggests:
The Second-Derivative Test for Local Maxima and Minima
• If f ′(p) = 0 and f ′′(p) > 0 then f has a local minimum at p.
• If f ′(p) = 0 and f ′′(p) < 0 then f has a local maximum at p.
• If f ′(p) = 0 and f ′′(p) = 0 then the test tells us nothing.

Chapter Four USING THE DERIVATIVE
Example 4
Classify as local maxima or local minima the critical points of f(x) = x3 −9x2 −48x + 52.
Solution
As we saw in Example 1 on page 186,
f ′(x) = 3x2 −18x −48
and the critical points of f are x = −2 and x = 8. We have
f ′′(x) = 6x −18.
Thus f ′′(8) = 30 > 0, so f has a local minimum at x = 8. Since f ′′(−2) = −30 < 0, f has a local
maximum at x = −2.
Warning! The second-derivative test does not tell us anything if both f ′(p) = 0 and f ′′(p) = 0.
For example, if f(x) = x3 and g(x) = x4, both f ′(0) = f ′′(0) = 0 and g′(0) = g′′(0) = 0. The
point x = 0 is a minimum for g but is neither a maximum nor a minimum for f. However, the
ﬁrst-derivative test is still useful. For example, g′ changes sign from negative to positive at x = 0,
so we know g has a local minimum there.
Concavity and Inflection Points
Investigating points where the slope changes sign led us to critical points. Now we look at points
where the concavity changes.
A point, p, at which the graph of a continuous function, f, changes concavity is called an
inﬂection point of f.
The words “inﬂection point of f” can refer either to a point in the domain of f or to a point on the
graph of f. The context of the problem will tell you which is meant.
How Do We Detect an Inflection Point?
To identify candidates for an inﬂection point of a continuous function, we often use the second
derivative.
Suppose f ′′ is deﬁned on both sides of a point p:
• If f ′′ is zero or undeﬁned at p, then p is a possible inﬂection point.
• To test whether p is an inﬂection point, check whether f ′′ changes sign at p.
The following example illustrates how local maxima and minima and inﬂection points are found.
Example 5
For x ≥0, ﬁnd the local maxima and minima and inﬂection points for g(x) = xe−x and sketch the
graph of g.
Solution
Taking derivatives and simplifying, we have
g′(x) = (1 −x)e−x
and
g′′(x) = (x −2)e−x.
So x = 1 is a critical point, and g′ > 0 for x < 1 and g′ < 0 for x > 1. Hence g increases to a local
maximum at x = 1 and then decreases. Since g(0) = 0 and g(x) > 0 for x > 0, there is a local
minimum at x = 0. Also, g(x) →0 as x →∞. There is an inﬂection point at x = 2 since g′′ < 0
for x < 2 and g′′ > 0 for x > 2. The graph is sketched in Figure 4.7.

Warning! Not every point x where f ′′(x) = 0 (or f ′′ is undeﬁned) is an inﬂection point (just
as not every point where f ′ = 0 is a local maximum or minimum). For instance f(x) = x4 has
f ′′(x) = 12x2 so f ′′(0) = 0, but f ′′ > 0 when x < 0 and when x > 0, so there is no change in
concavity at x = 0. See Figure 4.8.

Inflection Points and Local Maxima and Minima of the Derivative
Inﬂection points can also be interpreted in terms of ﬁrst derivatives. Applying the First Derivative
Test for local maxima and minima to f ′, we obtain the following result:
Suppose a function f has a continuous derivative. If f ′′ changes sign at p, then f has an
inﬂection point at p, and f ′ has a local minimum or a local maximum at p.
Figure 4.9 shows two inﬂection points. Notice that the curve crosses the tangent line at these
points and that the slope of the curve is a maximum or a minimum there.

Water is being poured into the vase in Figure 4.10 at a constant rate, measured in volume per unit
time. Graph y = f(t), the depth of the water against time, t. Explain the concavity and indicate the
inﬂection points.
Solution
At ﬁrst the water level, y, rises slowly because the base of the vase is wide, and it takes a lot of
water to make the depth increase. However, as the vase narrows, the rate at which the water is

192
Chapter Four USING THE DERIVATIVE
rising increases. Thus, y is increasing at an increasing rate and the graph is concave up. The rate of
increase in the water level is at a maximum when the water reaches the middle of the vase, where
the diameter is smallest; this is an inﬂection point. After that, the rate at which y increases decreases
again, so the graph is concave down. (See Figure 4.11.)

Showing Local Extrema Are at Critical Points
We now prove Theorem 4.1, which says that inside an interval, local maxima and minima can only
occur at critical points. Suppose that f has a local maximum at x = a. Assuming that f ′(a) is
deﬁned, the deﬁnition of the derivative gives
f ′(a) = lim
h→0
f(a + h) −f(a)
h
.
Since this is a two-sided limit, we have
f ′(a) = lim
h→0−
f(a + h) −f(a)
h
= lim
h→0+
f(a + h) −f(a)
h
.
By the deﬁnition of local maximum, f(a + h) ≤f(a) for all sufﬁciently small h. Thus f(a + h) −
f(a) ≤0 for sufﬁciently small h. The denominator, h, is negative when we take the limit from the
left and positive when we take the limit from the right. Thus
lim
h→0−
f(a + h) −f(a)
h
≥0
and
lim
h→0+
f(a + h) −f(a)
h
≤0.
Since both these limits are equal to f ′(a), we have f ′(a) ≥0 and f ′(a) ≤0, so we must have
f ′(a) = 0. The proof for a local minimum at x = a is similar.

OPTIMIZATION
The largest and smallest values of a quantity often have practical importance. For example, automo-
bile engineers want to construct a car that uses the least amount of fuel, scientists want to calculate
which wavelength carries the maximum radiation at a given temperature, and urban planners want to
design trafﬁc patterns to minimize delays. Such problems belong to the ﬁeld of mathematics called
optimization. The next three sections show how the derivative provides an efﬁcient way of solving
many optimization problems.
Global Maxima and Minima
The single greatest (or least) value of a function f over a speciﬁed domain is called the global
maximum (or minimum) of f. Recall that the local maxima and minima tell us where a function
is locally largest or smallest. Now we are interested in where the function is absolutely largest or
smallest in a given domain. We say
Suppose p is a point in the domain of f:
• f has a global minimum at p if f(p) is less than or equal to all values of f.
• f has a global maximum at p if f(p) is greater than or equal to all values of f.
Global maxima and minima are sometimes called extrema or optimal values.
Existence of Global Extrema
The following theorem describes when global extrema are guaranteed to exist:
Theorem 4.2: The Extreme Value Theorem
If f is continuous on the closed interval a ≤x ≤b, then f has a global maximum and a
global minimum on that interval.
For a proof of Theorem 4.2, see www.wiley.com/college/hughes-hallett.

How Do We Find Global Maxima and Minima?
If f is a continuous function deﬁned on a closed interval a ≤x ≤b (that is, an interval containing
its endpoints), then Theorem 4.2 guarantees that global maxima and minima exist. Figure 4.18 illus-
trates that the global maximum or minimum of f occurs either at a critical point or at an endpoint
of the interval, x = a or x = b. These points are the candidates for global extrema.

Global Maxima and Minima on a Closed Interval: Test the Candidates
For a continuous function f on a closed interval a ≤x ≤b:
• Find the critical points of f in the interval.
• Evaluate the function at the critical points and at the endpoints, a and b. The largest value
of the function is the global maximum; the smallest value is the global minimum.
If the function is deﬁned on an open interval a < x < b (that is, an interval not including
its endpoints) or on all real numbers, there may or may not be a global maximum or minimum.
For example, there is no global maximum in Figure 4.19 because the function has no actual largest
value. The global minimum in Figure 4.19 coincides with the local minimum. There is a global
minimum but no global maximum in Figure 4.20.
Global Maxima and Minima on an Open Interval or on All Real Numbers
For a continuous function, f, ﬁnd the value of f at all the critical points and sketch a graph.
Look at values of f when x approaches the endpoints of the interval, or approaches ±∞,
as appropriate. If there is only one critical point, look at the sign of f ′ on either side of the
critical point.

Example 1
Find the global maxima and minima of f(x) = x3 −9x2 −48x + 52 on the following intervals:
(a)
−5 ≤x ≤12
(b)
−5 ≤x ≤14
(c)
−5 ≤x < ∞.
Solution
(a) We have previously obtained the critical points x = −2 and x = 8 using
f ′(x) = 3x2 −18x −48 = 3(x + 2)(x −8).
We evaluate f at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval:
f(−5) = (−5)3 −9(−5)2 −48(−5) + 52 = −58
f(−2) = 104
f(8) = −396
f(12) = −92.
Comparing these function values, we see that the global maximum on [−5, 12] is 104 and occurs
at x = −2, and the global minimum on [−5, 12] is −396 and occurs at x = 8.
(b) For the interval [−5, 14], we compare
f(−5) = −58,
f(−2) = 104,
f(8) = −396,
f(14) = 360.
The global maximum is now 360 and occurs at x = 14, and the global minimum is still −396
and occurs at x = 8. Since the function is increasing for x > 8, changing the right-hand end
of the interval from x = 12 to x = 14 alters the global maximum but not the global minimum.
See Figure 4.21.
(c) Figure 4.21 shows that for −5 ≤x < ∞there is no global maximum, because we can make
f(x) as large as we please by choosing x large enough. The global minimum remains −396 at
x = 8.

Example 2
Find the global maximum and minimum of g(x) = x −sin(2x) on the interval 0 ≤x ≤π/2.
Solution
Since g(x) = x −sin(2x) is continuous and the interval 0 ≤x ≤π/2 is closed, there must be
a global maximum and minimum. The possible candidates are critical points in the interval and
endpoints. Since there are no points where g′(x) is undeﬁned, we solve g′(x) = 0 to ﬁnd all the
critical points:
g′(x) = 1 −2 cos(2x) = 0,
so cos(2x) = 1/2. Therefore 2x = π/3, 5π/3, . . .. Thus the only critical point in the interval is
x = π/6. We compare values of g at the critical points and the endpoints:
g(0) = 0,
g(π/6) = π/6 −
√
3/2 = −0.342,
g(π/2) = π/2 = 1.571.
Thus the global maximum is 1.571 at x = π/2 and the global minimum is −0.342 at x = π/6. See
Figure 4.22.

Example 3
Jared is coughing. The speed in m/sec, v(r), with which he expels air depends on the radius, r, of
his windpipe, given for 0 ≤r ≤9 in mm by
v(r) = 0.1(9 −r)r2.
What value of r maximizes the speed? For what value is the speed minimized?
Solution
Notice that v(0) = v(9) = 0, and that v(r) is positive for 0 < r < 9. Therefore the maximum
occurs somewhere between r = 0 and r = 9. Since
v(r) = 0.1(9 −r)r2 = 0.9r2 −0.1r3,
the derivative is
v′(r) = 1.8r −0.3r2 = 0.3r(6 −r).
The derivative is zero if r = 0 or r = 6. These are the critical points of v. We already know
v(0) = v(9) = 0, and
v(6) = 0.1(9 −6)62 = 10.8 m/sec.
Thus, v has a global maximum at r = 6 mm. The global minimum of v = 0 m/sec occurs at both
endpoints r = 0 mm and r = 9 mm.
In applications of optimization, the function being optimized often contains a parameter whose
value depends on the situation, and the maximum or minimum depends on the parameter.
Example 4
(a) For a positive constant b, the surge function f(t) = te−bt gives the quantity of a drug in the
body for time t ≥0. Find the global maximum and minimum of f(t) for t ≥0.
(b) Find the value of b making t = 10 the global maximum.
Solution
(a) Differentiating and factoring gives
f ′(t) = 1 · e−bt −bte−bt = (1 −bt)e−bt,
so there is a critical point at t = 1/b.
The sign of f ′ is determined by the sign of (1 −bt), so f ′ is positive to the left of t = 1/b
and negative to the right of t = 1/b. Since f increases to the left of t = 1/b and decreases to the
right of t = 1/b, the global maximum occurs at t = 1/b. In addition, f(0) = 0 and f(t) ≥0
for all t ≥0, so the global minimum occurs at t = 0. Thus
The global maximum value is f

Example 5
When an arrow is shot into the air, its range, R, is deﬁned as the horizontal distance from the archer
to the point where the arrow hits the ground. If the ground is horizontal and we neglect air resistance,
it can be shown that
R = v02 sin(2θ)
g
,
where v0 is the initial velocity of the arrow, g is the (constant) acceleration due to gravity, and θ is
the angle above horizontal, so 0 ≤θ ≤π/2. (See Figure 4.24.) What angle θ maximizes R?

Figure 4.24: Arrow’s path
Solution
We can ﬁnd the maximum of this function without using calculus. The maximum value of R occurs
when sin(2θ) = 1, so θ = arcsin(1)/2 = π/4, giving R = v2
0/g.
Let’s see how we can do the same problem with calculus. We want to ﬁnd the global maximum
of R for 0 ≤θ ≤π/2. First we look for critical points:
dR
dθ = 2v2
0 cos(2θ)
g
.
Setting dR/dθ equal to 0, we get
0 = cos(2θ),
or
2θ = ±π
2 , ±3π
2 , ±5π
2 , . . .
so π/4 is the only critical point in the interval 0 ≤θ ≤π/2. The range at θ = π/4 is R = v02/g.
Now we must check the value of R at the endpoints θ = 0 and θ = π/2. Since R = 0 at each
endpoint (the arrow is shot horizontally or vertically), the critical point θ = π/4 gives both a local
and a global maximum on 0 ≤θ ≤π/2. Therefore, the arrow goes farthest if shot at an angle of
π/4, or 45◦.
Finding Upper and Lower Bounds
A problem which is closely related to ﬁnding maxima and minima is ﬁnding the bounds of a func-
tion. In Example 1 on page 198, the value of f(x) on the interval [−5, 12] ranges from −396 to 104.
Thus
−396 ≤f(x) ≤104,
and we say that −396 is a lower bound for f and 104 is an upper bound for f on [−5, 12]. (See
Appendix A for more on bounds.) Of course, we could also say that
−400 ≤f(x) ≤150,
so that f is also bounded below by −400 and above by 150 on [−5, 12]. However, we consider
the −396 and 104 to be the best possible bounds because they describe more accurately how the
function f(x) behaves on [−5, 12].

Example 6
An object on a spring oscillates about its equilibrium position at y = 0. See Figure 4.25. Its dis-
placement, y, from equilibrium is given as a function of time, t, by
y = e−t cos t.
Find the greatest distance the object goes above and below the equilibrium for t ≥0.
Solution
We are looking for bounds for y as a function of t. What does the graph look like? We can think of
it as a cosine curve with a decreasing amplitude of e−t; in other words, it is a cosine curve squashed
between the graphs of y = e−t and y = −e−t, forming a wave with lower and lower crests and
shallower and shallower troughs. (See Figure 4.26.)

Figure 4.26: f(t) = e−t cos t for t ≥0
From the graph, we see that for t ≥0, the curve lies between the horizontal lines y = −1 and
y = 1. This means that −1 and 1 are bounds:
−1 ≤e−t cos t ≤1.
The line y = 1 is the best possible upper bound because the graph does come up that high (at
t = 0). However, we can ﬁnd a better lower bound if we ﬁnd the global minimum value of y for
t ≥0; this minimum occurs in the ﬁrst trough between t = π/2 and t = 3π/2 because later troughs
are squashed closer to the t-axis. At the minimum, dy/dt = 0. The product rule gives
dy
dt = (−e−t) cos t + e−t(−sin t) = −e−t(cos t + sin t) = 0.
Since e−t is never 0, we must have
cos t + sin t = 0,
so
sin t
cos t = −1.
The smallest positive solution of
tan t = −1
is
t = 3π

Thus, the global minimum we see on the graph occurs at t = 3π/4. The value of y there is
y = e−3π/4 cos

≈−0.07.
The greatest distance the object goes below equilibrium is 0.07. Thus, for all t ≥0,
−0.07 ≤e−t cos t ≤1.
Notice how much smaller in magnitude the lower bound is than the upper. This is a reﬂection of
how quickly the factor e−t causes the oscillation to die out.

(b) If f is not continuous on [a, b] then f does not have
a global maximum on [a, b].
(c) If f does not have a global maximum on [a, b] then
f is not continuous on [a, b].
Are the statements in Problems 59–63 true of false? Give an
explanation for your answer.
59. Since the function f(x) = 1/x is continuous for x > 0

4.3 OPTIMIZATION AND MODELING

OPTIMIZATION AND MODELING
Finding global maxima and minima is often made possible by having a formula for the function
to be maximized or minimized. The process of translating a problem into a function with a known
formula is called mathematical modeling. The examples that follow give the ﬂavor of modeling.
Example 1
What are the dimensions of an aluminum can that holds 40 in3 of juice and that uses the least
material? Assume that the can is cylindrical, and is capped on both ends.
Solution
It is often a good idea to think about a problem in general terms before trying to solve it. Since
we’re trying to use as little material as possible, why not make the can very small, say, the size of a
peanut? We can’t, since the can must hold 40 in3. If we make the can short, to try to use less material
in the sides, we’ll have to make it fat as well, so that it can hold 40 in3. See Figure 4.29(a).

If we try to save material by making the top and bottom small, the can has to be tall to ac-
commodate the 40 in3 of juice. So any savings we get by using a small top and bottom may be
outweighed by the height of the sides. See Figure 4.29(b).
Table 4.1 gives the height h and amount of material M used in the can for some choices of the
radius, r. You can see that r and h change in opposite directions, and that more material is used at
the extremes (very large or very small r) than in the middle. It appears that the radius needing the
smallest amount of material, M, is somewhere between 1 and 3 inches. Thinking of M as a function
of the radius, r, we get the graph in Figure 4.30. The graph shows that the global minimum we want
is at a critical point.

Both the table and the graph were obtained from a mathematical model, which in this case is a
formula for the material used in making the can. Finding such a formula depends on knowing the
geometry of a cylinder, in particular its area and volume. We have
M = Material used in the can = Material in ends + Material in the side

206
Chapter Four USING THE DERIVATIVE
where
Material in ends = 2 · Area of a circle with radius r = 2 · πr2,
Material in the side = Area of curved side of cylinder with height h and radius r = 2πrh.
We have
M = 2πr2 + 2πrh.
However, h is not independent of r: if r grows, h shrinks, and vice-versa. To ﬁnd the relation-
ship, we use the fact that the volume of the cylinder, πr2h, is equal to the constant 40 in3:
Volume of can = πr2h = 40,
giving
h = 40
πr2 .
This means
Material in the side = 2πrh = 2πr 40
πr2 = 80
r .
Thus we obtain the formula for the total material, M, used in a can of radius r if the volume is 40
in3:
M = 2πr2 + 80
r .
The domain of this function is all r > 0 because the radius of the can cannot be negative or zero.
To ﬁnd the minimum of M, we look for critical points:
dM
dr = 4πr −80
r2 = 0
at a critical point,
so
4πr = 80
r2 .
Therefore,
πr3 = 20,
so
r =
20
π
1/3
= 1.85 inches,
which agrees with the graph in Figure 4.30. We also have
h = 40
πr2 =
40
π(1.85)2 = 3.7 inches.
The material used is M = 2π(1.85)2 + 80/1.85 = 64.7 in2.
To conﬁrm that we have found the global minimum, we look at the formula for dM/dr. For
small r, the −80/r2 term dominates and for large r, the 4πr term dominates, so dM/dr is negative
for r < 1.85 and positive for r > 1.85. Thus, M is decreasing for r < 1.85 and increasing for
r > 1.85, so the global minimum occurs at r = 1.85.
Practical Tips for Modeling Optimization Problems
1. Make sure that you know what quantity or function is to be optimized.
2. If possible, make several sketches showing how the elements that vary are related. Label
your sketches clearly by assigning variables to quantities which change.
3. Try to obtain a formula for the function to be optimized in terms of the variables that
you identiﬁed in the previous step. If necessary, eliminate from this formula all but one
variable. Identify the domain over which this variable varies.
4. Find the critical points and evaluate the function at these points and the endpoints (if
relevant) to ﬁnd the global maxima and/or minima.
The next example, another problem in geometry, illustrates this approach.
Example 2
Alaina wants to get to the bus stop as quickly as possible. The bus stop is across a grassy park, 2000
feet west and 600 feet north of her starting position. Alaina can walk west along the edge of the park
on the sidewalk at a speed of 6 ft/sec. She can also travel through the grass in the park, but only at a
rate of 4 ft/sec. What path gets her to the bus stop the fastest?

Figure 4.31: Three possible paths to the bus stop
We might ﬁrst think that she should take a path that is the shortest distance. Unfortunately, the
path that follows the shortest distance to the bus stop is entirely in the park, where her speed is
slow. (See Figure 4.31(a).) That distance is
√
20002 + 6002 = 2088 feet, which takes her about 522
seconds to traverse. She could instead walk quickly the entire 2000 feet along the sidewalk, which
leaves her just the 600-foot northward journey through the park. (See Figure 4.31(b).) This method
would take 2000/6 + 600/4 ≈483 seconds total walking time.
But can she do even better? Perhaps another combination of sidewalk and park gives a shorter
travel time. For example, what is the travel time if she walks 1000 feet west along the sidewalk and
the rest of the way through the park? (See Figure 4.31(c).) The answer is about 458 seconds.
We make a model for this problem. We label the distance that Alaina walks west along the
sidewalk x and the distance she walks through the park y, as in Figure 4.32. Then the total time, t,
is
t = tsidewalk + tpark.
Since
Time = Distance/Speed,
and she can walk 6 ft/sec on the sidewalk and 4 ft/sec in the park, we have
t = x
6 + y
4.
Now, by the Pythagorean Theorem, y =

t = x

We can ﬁnd the critical points of this function analytically. (See Problem 15 on page 211.) Alterna-
tively, we can graph the function on a calculator and estimate the critical point, which is x ≈1463
feet. This gives a minimum total time of about 445 seconds.

208
Chapter Four USING THE DERIVATIVE
Solution
We want to choose a to maximize the area of the rectangle with corners at (a, √a) and (9, √a). The
area of this rectangle is given by
R = Height · Length = √a(9 −a) = 9a1/2 −a3/2.
We are restricted to 0 ≤a ≤9. To maximize this area, we ﬁrst set dR/da = 0 to ﬁnd critical points:

Notice that R = 0 at the endpoints a = 0 and a = 9, and R is positive between these values. Since
a = 3 is the only critical point, the rectangle with the maximum area has length 9 −3 = 6 and
height
√
3.

(a) Find a formula for the volume, V , of the box as a function of x. What is the domain of V ?
(b) Graph V as a function of x.
(c) Find the maximum value of V .
Solution
(a) The height of the box is h, as shown in Figure 4.34. The box has six sides, four with area xh
and two, the top and bottom, with area x2. Thus,
4xh + 2x2 = A.
So
h = A −2x2

Then, the volume, V , is given by

Since the area of the top and bottom combined must be less than A, we have 2x2 ≤A. Thus,

A light is suspended at a height h above the ﬂoor. (See Figure 4.36.) The illumination at the point
P is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the point P to the light and directly
proportional to the cosine of the angle θ. How far from the ﬂoor should the light be to maximize the
illumination at the point P?

Figure 4.36: How high should the light be?
Solution
If the illumination is represented by I and r is the distance from the light to the point P, then we
know that for some k ≥0,
I = k cos θ
r2
.
Since r2 = h2 + 102 and cos θ = h/r = h/
√
h2 + 102, we have, for h ≥0,
I =
kh
(h2 + 102)3/2 .
To ﬁnd the height at which I is maximized, we differentiate using the quotient rule:
dI
dh = k(h2 + 102)3/2 −kh( 3
2(h2 + 102)1/2(2h))
[(h2 + 102)3/2]2
= (h2 + 102)1/2[k(h2 + 102) −3kh2]
(h2 + 102)3
= k(h2 + 102) −3kh2
(h2 + 102)5/2
= k(102 −2h2)
(h2 + 102)5/2 .
Setting dI/dh = 0 for h ≥0 gives
102 −2h2 = 0
h =
√
50 meters.
Since dI/dh > 0 for h <
√
50 and dI/dh < 0 for h >
√
50, there is a local maximum at h =
√
50
meters. There is only one critical point, so the global maximum of I occurs at that point. Thus, the
illumination is greatest if the light is suspended at a height of
√
50 ≈7 meters above the ﬂoor.
A Graphical Example: Minimizing Gas Consumption
Next we look at an example in which a function is given graphically and the optimum values are
read from a graph. We already know how to estimate the optimum values of f(x) from a graph of
f(x)—read off the highest and lowest values. In this example, we see how to estimate the optimum

Figure 4.37: Gas consumption versus velocity
Solution
Figure 4.38 shows that g/v is the slope of the line from the origin to the point P. Where on the
curve should P be to make the slope a minimum? From the possible positions of the line shown in
Figure 4.38, we see that the slope of the line is both a local and global minimum when the line is
tangent to the curve. From Figure 4.39, we can see that the velocity at this point is about 50 mph.
Thus to minimize gas consumption per mile, we should drive about 50 mph.

A certain ferry boat uses $100 worth of fuel per hour

41. A bird such as a starling feeds worms to its young. To
collect worms, the bird ﬂies to a site where worms are to
be found, picks up several in its beak, and ﬂies back to
its nest. The loading curve in Figure 4.42 shows how the
number of worms (the load) a starling collects depends
on the time it has been searching for them.4 The curve is
concave down because the bird can pick up worms more
efﬁciently when its beak is empty; when its beak is partly
full, the bird becomes much less efﬁcient. The traveling
time (from nest to site and back) is represented by the
distance PO in Figure 4.42. The bird wants to maximize
the rate at which it brings worms to the nest, where
Rate worms arrive =

52. The forward motion of an aircraft in level ﬂight is re-
duced by two kinds of forces, known as induced drag
and parasite drag. Induced drag is a consequence of the
downward deﬂection of air as the wings produce lift. Par-
asite drag results from friction between the air and the
entire surface of the aircraft. Induced drag is inversely
proportional to the square of speed and parasite drag is
directly proportional to the square of speed. The sum of
induced drag and parasite drag is called total drag. The
graph in Figure 4.50 shows a certain aircraft’s induced
drag and parasite drag functions.

Chapter Four USING THE DERIVATIVE

FAMILIES OF FUNCTIONS AND MODELING
We saw in Chapter 1 that knowledge of one function can provide knowledge of the graphs of many
others. The shape of the graph of y = x2 also tells us, indirectly, about the graphs of y = x2 +
2, y = (x + 2)2, y = 2x2, and countless other functions. We say that all functions of the form
y = a(x + b)2 + c form a family of functions; their graphs are like that of y = x2, except for shifts
and stretches determined by the values of a, b, and c. The constants a, b, c are called parameters.
Different values of the parameters give different members of the family.
The Bell-Shaped Curve: y = e−(x−a)2/b
The family of bell-shaped curves includes the family of normal density functions, used in probability
and statistics.7 We assume that b > 0. See Section 8.8 for applications of the normal distribution.
First we let b = 1 and examine the role of a.
Example 1
Graph y = e−(x−a)2 for a = −2, 0, 2 and explain the role of a in the shape of the graph.
Solution
See Figure 4.53. The role of the parameter a is to shift the graph of y = e−x2 to the right or left.
Notice that the value of y is always positive. Since y →0 as x →±∞, the x-axis is a horizontal
asymptote. Thus y = e−(x−a)2 is the family of horizontal shifts of the bell-shaped curve y = e−x2.

We now consider the role of the parameter b by studying the family with a = 0.
Example 2
Find the critical points and points of inﬂection of y = e−x2/b.
Solution
To investigate the critical points and points of inﬂection, we calculate
dy
dx = −2x
b e−x2/b
and, using the product rule, we get

Critical points occur where dy/dx = 0, that is, where
dy
dx = −2x
b e−x2/b = 0.
Since e−x2/b is never zero, the only critical point is x = 0. At that point, y = 1 and d2y/dx2 < 0.
Hence, by the second derivative test, there is a local maximum at x = 0, and this is also a global
maximum.
Inﬂection points occur where the second derivative changes sign; thus, we start by ﬁnding
values of x for which d2y/dx2 = 0. Since e−x2/b is never zero, d2y/dx2 = 0 when
2x2

−1 = 0.

Solving for x gives
x = ±
 
b
2.
Looking at the expression for d2y/dx2, we see that d2y/dx2 is negative for x = 0, and positive as
x →±∞. Therefore the concavity changes at x = −

b/2 and at x =

b/2, so we have inﬂection
points at x = ±

b/2.
Returning to the two-parameter family y = e−(x−a)2/b, we conclude that there is a maximum
at x = a, obtained by horizontally shifting the maximum at x = 0 of y = e−x2/b by a units. There
are inﬂection points at x = a ±

b/2 obtained by shifting the inﬂection points x = ±

b/2 of
y = e−x2/b by a units. (See Figure 4.54.) At the inﬂection points y = e−1/2 ≈0.6.
With this information we can see the effect of the parameters. The parameter a determines the
location of the center of the bell and the parameter b determines how narrow or wide the bell is. (See
Figure 4.55.) If b is small, then the inﬂection points are close to a and the bell is sharply peaked
near a; if b is large, the inﬂection points are farther away from a and the bell is spread out.

Modeling with Families of Functions
One reason for studying families of functions is their use in mathematical modeling. Confronted
with the problem of modeling some phenomenon, a crucial ﬁrst step involves recognizing families
of functions which might ﬁt the available data.
Motion Under Gravity: y = −4.9t2 + v0t + y0
The position of an object moving vertically under the inﬂuence of gravity can be described by a
function in the two-parameter family
y = −4.9t2 + v0t + y0
where t is time in seconds and y is the distance in meters above the ground. Why do we need the
parameters v0 and y0? Notice that at time t = 0 we have y = y0. Thus the parameter y0 gives the
height above ground of the object at time t = 0. Since dy/dt = −9.8t + v0, the parameter v0 gives
the velocity of the object at time t = 0. From this equation we see that dy/dt = 0 when t = v0/9.8.
This is the time when the object reaches its maximum height.
Example 3
Give a function describing the position of a projectile launched upward from ground level with an
initial velocity of 50 m/sec. How high does the projectile rise?
Solution
We have y0 = 0 and v0 = 50, so the height of the projectile after t seconds is y = −4.9t2 + 50t.
It reaches its maximum height when t = 50/9.8 = 5.1 seconds, and its height at that time is
−4.9(5.1)2 + 50(5.1) = 127.5, or about 128 meters.

Exponential Model with a Limit: y = a(1 −e−bx)
We consider a, b > 0. The graph of one member, with a = 2 and b = 1, is in Figure 4.56. Such
a graph represents a quantity which is increasing but leveling off. For example, a body dropped
in a thick ﬂuid speeds up initially, but its velocity levels off as it approaches a terminal velocity.
Similarly, if a pollutant pouring into a lake builds up toward a saturation level, its concentration
may be described in this way. The graph also represents the temperature of an object in an oven.

Example 4
Describe the effect of varying the parameters a and b on the graph of y = a(1 −e−bx).
Solution
First examine the effect on the graph of varying a. Fix b at some positive number, say b = 1.
Substitute different values for a and look at the graphs in Figure 4.57. We see that as x gets larger,
y approaches a from below, so a is an upper bound for this function. Analytically, this follows from
the fact that e−bx →0 as x →∞. Physically, the value of a represents the terminal velocity of a
falling body or the saturation level of the pollutant in the lake.
Now examine the effect of varying b on the graph. Fix a at some positive number, say a = 2.
Substitute different values for b and look at the graphs in Figure 4.58. The parameter b determines
how sharply the curve rises and how quickly it gets close to the line y = a.
Let’s conﬁrm the last observation in Example 4 analytically. For y = a(1 −e−bx), we have
dy/dx = abe−bx, so the slope of the tangent to the curve at x = 0 is ab. For larger b, the curve rises
more rapidly at x = 0. How long does it take the curve to climb halfway up from y = 0 to y = a?
When y = a/2, we have
a(1 −e−bx) = a
2,
which leads to
x = ln 2
b .
If b is large then (ln 2)/b is small, so in a short distance the curve is already half way up to a. If b is
small, then (ln 2)/b is large and we have to go a long way out to get up to a/2. See Figure 4.59.

Example 5
The number, N, of people who have heard a rumor spread by mass media by time t is modeled by
N(t) = a(1 −e−bt).
There are 200,000 people in the population who hear the rumor eventually. If 10% of them heard it
the ﬁrst day, ﬁnd a and b, assuming t is measured in days.
Solution
Since lim
t→∞N(t) = a, we have a = 200,000. When t = 1, we have N = 0.1(200,000) = 20,000
people, so substituting into the formula gives
N(1) = 20,000 = 200,000

The Logistic Model: y = L/(1 + Ae−kt)
The logistic family is often used to model population growth when it is limited by the environment.
(See Section 11.7.) We assume that L, A, k > 0 and we look at the roles of each of the three
parameters in turn.

Figure 4.62: Graph of
y = L/(1 + Ae−kt) varying k,
with L = 30, A = 50
Logistic curves with varying values of L are shown in Figure 4.60. The values of y level off as
t →∞because Ae−kt →0 as t →∞. Thus, as t increases, the values of y approach L. The line
y = L is a horizontal asymptote, called the limiting value or carrying capacity, and representing
the maximum sustainable population. The parameter L stretches or shrinks the graph vertically.
In Figure 4.61 we investigate the effect of the parameter A, with k and L ﬁxed. The parameter
A alters the point at which the curve cuts the y-axis—larger values of A move the y-intercept closer
to the origin. At t = 0 we have y = L/(1 + A), conﬁrming that increasing A decreases the value of
y at t = 0.
Figure 4.62 shows the effect of the parameter k. With L and A ﬁxed, we see that varying k
affects the rate at which the function approaches the limiting value L. If k is small, the graph rises
slowly; if k is large, the graph rises steeply. At t = 0, we have dy/dt = LAk/(1 + A)2, so the
initial slope of a logistic curve is proportional to k.
The graphs suggest that none of the curves has a critical point for t > 0. Some curves appear
to have a point of inﬂection; others have none. To investigate, we take derivatives:
dy
dt =
LAke−kt
(1 + Ae−kt)2 .
Since every factor of dy/dt is positive, the ﬁrst derivative is always positive. Thus, there are no
critical points and the function is always increasing.

220
Chapter Four USING THE DERIVATIVE
Using a computer algebra system or the quotient rule, we ﬁnd
d2y
dt2 = LAk2e−kt(−1 + Ae−kt)
(1 + Ae−kt)3
.
Since L, A, k, e−kt, and the denominator are always positive, the sign of d2y/dt2 is determined
by the sign of (−1 + Ae−kt). Points of inﬂection may occur where d2y/dt2 = 0. This is where
−1 + Ae−kt = 0, or
Ae−kt = 1.
At this value of t,
y =
L
1 + Ae−kt =
L
1 + 1 = L
2 .
In Problem 22 on page 221, we see that d2y/dt2 changes sign at y = L/2. Since the concavity
changes at y = L/2, there is a point of inﬂection when the population is half the carrying capacity. If
the initial population is L/2 or above, there is no inﬂection point. (See the top graph in Figure 4.61.)
To ﬁnd the value of t at the inﬂection point, we solve for t in the equation
Ae−kt = 1
t = ln(1/A)
−k
= ln A
k .
Thus, increasing the value of A moves the inﬂection point to the right. (See the bottom two graphs
in Figure 4.61.)

APPLICATIONS TO MARGINALITY
Management decisions within a particular business usually aim at maximizing proﬁt for the com-
pany. In this section we see how the derivative can be used to maximize proﬁt. Proﬁt depends on both
production cost and revenue (or income) from sales. We begin by looking at the cost and revenue
functions.
The cost function, C(q), gives the total cost of producing a quantity q of some good.
What sort of function do we expect C to be? The more goods that are made, the higher the total
cost, so C is an increasing function. In fact, cost functions usually have the general shape shown
in Figure 4.67. The intercept on the C-axis represents the ﬁxed costs, which are incurred even if
nothing is produced. (This includes, for instance, the machinery needed to begin production.) The
cost function increases quickly at ﬁrst and then more slowly because producing larger quantities of
a good is usually more efﬁcient than producing smaller quantities—this is called economy of scale.
At still higher production levels, the cost function starts to increase faster again as resources become
scarce, and sharp increases may occur when new factories have to be built. Thus, the graph of C(q)
may start out concave down and become concave up later on.
q (quantity)
C (cost)
Figure 4.67: Cost as a function of quantity
The revenue function, R(q), gives the total revenue received by a ﬁrm from selling a quantity
q of some good.
Revenue is income obtained from sales. If the price per item is p, and the quantity sold is q,
then
Revenue = Price × Quantity,
so
R = pq.
If the price per item does not depend on the quantity sold, then the graph of R(q) is a straight line
through the origin with slope equal to the price p. See Figure 4.68. In practice, for large values of q,
the market may become glutted, causing the price to drop, giving R(q) the shape in Figure 4.69.
R (revenue)

4.5 APPLICATIONS TO MARGINALITY
225
The proﬁt is usually written as π. (Economists use π to distinguish it from the price, p; this π
has nothing to do with the area of a circle, and merely stands for the Greek equivalent of the letter
“p.”) The proﬁt resulting from producing and selling q items is deﬁned by
Proﬁt = Revenue −Cost,
so
π(q) = R(q) −C(q).
Example 1
If cost, C, and revenue, R, are given by the graph in Figure 4.70, for what production quantities, q,
does the ﬁrm make a proﬁt? Approximately what production level maximizes proﬁt?

The ﬁrm makes a proﬁt whenever revenues are greater than costs, that is, when R > C. The graph
of R is above the graph of C approximately when 130 < q < 215. Production between q = 130
units and q = 215 units generates a proﬁt. The vertical distance between the cost and revenue curves
is largest at q0, so q0 units gives maximum proﬁt.
Marginal Analysis
Many economic decisions are based on an analysis of the costs and revenues “at the margin.” Let’s
look at this idea through an example.
Suppose we are running an airline and we are trying to decide whether to offer an additional
ﬂight. How should we decide? We’ll assume that the decision is to be made purely on ﬁnancial
grounds: if the ﬂight will make money for the company, it should be added. Obviously we need to
consider the costs and revenues involved. Since the choice is between adding this ﬂight and leaving
things the way they are, the crucial question is whether the additional costs incurred are greater or
smaller than the additional revenues generated by the ﬂight. These additional costs and revenues are
called the marginal costs and marginal revenues.
Suppose C(q) is the function giving the total cost of running q ﬂights. If the airline had orig-
inally planned to run 100 ﬂights, its costs would be C(100). With the additional ﬂight, its costs
would be C(101). Therefore,
Additional cost “at the margin” = C(101) −C(100).
Now
C(101) −C(100) = C(101) −C(100)
101 −100
,
and this quantity is the average rate of change of cost between 100 and 101 ﬂights. In Figure 4.71 the
average rate of change is the slope of the line joining the C(100) and C(101) points on the graph. If
the graph of the cost function is not curving fast near the point, the slope of this line is close to the
slope of the tangent line there. Therefore, the average rate of change is close to the instantaneous
rate of change. Since these rates of change are not very different, many economists choose to deﬁne
marginal cost, MC, as the instantaneous rate of change of cost with respect to quantity:

Figure 4.71: Marginal cost: Slope of one of these lines
Marginal cost = MC = C′(q)
so
Marginal cost ≈C(q + 1) −C(q).
Similarly, if the revenue generated by q ﬂights is R(q) and the number of ﬂights increases from
100 to 101, then
Additional revenue “at the margin” = R(101) −R(100).
Now R(101) −R(100) is the average rate of change of revenue between 100 and 101 ﬂights. As
before, the average rate of change is usually almost equal to the instantaneous rate of change, so
economists often deﬁne:
Marginal revenue = MR = R′(q)
so
Marginal revenue ≈R(q + 1) −R(q).
We often refer to total cost, C, and total revenue, R, to distinguish them from marginal cost,
MC, and marginal revenue, MR. If the words cost and revenue are used alone, they are understood
to mean total cost and total revenue.
Example 2
If C(q) and R(q) for the airline are given in Figure 4.72, should the company add the 101st ﬂight?
Solution
The marginal revenue is the slope of the revenue curve, and the marginal cost is the slope of the cost
curve at the point 100. From Figure 4.72, you can see that the slope at the point A is smaller than
the slope at B, so MC < MR. This means that the airline will make more in extra revenue than it
will spend in extra costs if it runs another ﬂight, so it should go ahead and run the 101st ﬂight.

Figure 4.73: Total revenue and total cost for Example 3
Solution
The revenue graph is a line through the origin, with equation
R = pq
where p is the price, which is a constant. The slope is p and
MR = R′(q) = p.
The total cost is increasing, so the marginal cost is always positive (above the q-axis). For small q
values, the total cost curve is concave down, so the marginal cost is decreasing. For larger q, say
q > 100, the total cost curve is concave up and the marginal cost is increasing. Thus the marginal
cost has a minimum at about q = 100. (See Figure 4.74.)

Now let’s look at how to maximize proﬁt, given functions for total revenue and total cost.

Figure 4.75: Maximum proﬁt at q = 140

228
Chapter Four USING THE DERIVATIVE
Solution
The proﬁt is represented by the vertical difference between the curves and is marked by the vertical
arrows on the graph. When revenue is below cost, the company is taking a loss; when revenue is
above cost, the company is making a proﬁt. We can see that the proﬁt is largest at about q = 140,
so this is the production level we’re looking for. To be sure that the local maximum is a global
maximum, we need to check the endpoints. At q = 0 and q = 200, the proﬁt is negative, so the
global maximum is indeed at q = 140.
To ﬁnd the actual maximum proﬁt, we estimate the vertical distance between the curves at
q = 140. This gives a maximum proﬁt of $80,000 −$60,000 = $20,000.
Suppose we wanted to ﬁnd the minimum proﬁt. In this example, we must look at the endpoints,
when q = 0 or q = 200. We see the minimum proﬁt is negative (a loss), and it occurs at q = 0.
Maximum Profit Occurs Where MR = MC
In Example 4, observe that at q = 140 the slopes of the two curves in Figure 4.75 are equal. To the
left of q = 140, the revenue curve has a larger slope than the cost curve, and the proﬁt increases as
q increases. The company will make more money by producing more units, so production should
increase toward q = 140. To the right of q = 140, the slope of the revenue curve is less than
the slope of the cost curve, and the proﬁt is decreasing. The company will make more money by
producing fewer units so production should decrease toward q = 140. At the point where the slopes
are equal, the proﬁt has a local maximum; otherwise the proﬁt could be increased by moving toward
that point. Since the slopes are equal at q = 140, we have MR = MC there.
Now let’s look at the general situation. To maximize or minimize proﬁt over an interval, we
optimize the proﬁt, π, where
π(q) = R(q) −C(q).
We know that global maxima and minima can only occur at critical points or at endpoints of an
interval. To ﬁnd critical points of π, look for zeros of the derivative:
π′(q) = R′(q) −C′(q) = 0.
So
R′(q) = C′(q),
that is, the slopes of the revenue and cost curves are equal. This is the same observation that we
made in the previous example. In economic language,
The maximum (or minimum) proﬁt can occur where
Marginal cost = Marginal revenue.
Of course, maximal or minimal proﬁt does not have to occur where MR = MC; there are also
the endpoints to consider.
Example 5
Find the quantity q which maximizes proﬁt if the total revenue, R(q), and total cost, C(q), are given
in dollars by
R(q) = 5q −0.003q2
C(q) = 300 + 1.1q,
where 0 ≤q ≤800 units. What production level gives the minimum proﬁt?

4.5 APPLICATIONS TO MARGINALITY
229
Solution
We look for production levels that give marginal revenue = marginal cost:
MR = R′(q) = 5 −0.006q
MC = C′(q) = 1.1.
So 5 −0.006q = 1.1, giving
q = 3.9/0.006 = 650 units.
Does this value of q represent a local maximum or minimum of π? We can tell by looking at
production levels of 649 units and 651 units. When q = 649 we have MR = $1.106, which is
greater than the (constant) marginal cost of $1.10. This means that producing one more unit will
bring in more revenue than its cost, so proﬁt will increase. When q = 651, MR = $1.094, which
is less than MC, so it is not proﬁtable to produce the 651st unit. We conclude that q = 650 is a
local maximum for the proﬁt function π. The proﬁt earned by producing and selling this quantity is
π(650) = R(650) −C(650) = $967.50.
To check for global maxima we need to look at the endpoints. If q = 0, the only cost is $300
(the ﬁxed costs) and there is no revenue, so π(0) = −$300. At the upper limit of q = 800, we
have π(800) = $900. Therefore, the maximum proﬁt is at the production level of 650 units, where
MR = MC. The minimum proﬁt (a loss) occurs when q = 0 and there is no production at all.

We assume that q can be expressed as a Cobb-Douglas
production function:
q = cKαLβ,

where c, α, β are positive constants, with 0 < α < 1
and 0 < β < 1. In this problem we will see how the
Russian government could use a Cobb-Douglas function
to estimate how many people a newly privatized industry
might employ. A company in such an industry has only a
small amount of capital available to it and needs to use all
of it, so K is ﬁxed. Suppose L is measured in man-hours
per month, and that each man-hour costs the company w
rubles (a ruble is the unit of Russian currency). Suppose
the company has no other costs besides labor, and that
each unit of the good can be sold for a ﬁxed price of p
rubles. How many man-hours of labor per month should
the company use in order to maximize its proﬁt?

RATES AND RELATED RATES
Derivatives represent rates of change. In this section, we see how to calculate rates in a variety of
situations.
Example 1
A spherical snowball is melting. Its radius decreases at a constant rate of 2 cm per minute from an
initial value of 70 cm. How fast is the volume decreasing half an hour later?
Solution
The radius, r, starts at 70 cm and decreases at 2 cm/min. At time t minutes since the start,
r = 70 −2t cm.
The volume of the snowball is given by
V = 4
3πr3 = 4
3π(70 −2t)3 cm3.
The rate at which the volume is changing at time t is
dV
dt = 4
3π · 3(70 −2t)2(−2) = −8π(70 −2t)2 cm3/min.
The volume is measured in cm3, and time is in minutes, so after half an hour t = 30, and
dV
dt

t=30
= −8π(70 −2 · 30)2 = −800π cm3/min.
Thus, the rate at which the volume is increasing is −800π ≈−2500 cm3/min; the rate at which the
volume is decreasing is about 2500 cm3/min.
Example 2

(a) Find s′(0) and s′′(0) and interpret in terms of the skydiver.
(b) Relate the units of s′(t) and s′′(t) to the units of t and s(t).
Solution

s′(t) = m2g

Since e−k·0/m = 1, evaluating at t = 0 gives
s′(0) = mg

and
s′′(0) = g.
The ﬁrst derivative of distance is velocity, so the fact that s′(0) = 0 tells us that the sky-

In Example 1, the radius of the snowball decreased at a constant rate. A more realistic scenario is
that the radius decreases at a varying rate. In this case, we may not be able to write a formula for V
as a function of t. However, we may still be able to calculate dV/dt, as in the following example.
Example 3
A spherical snowball melts in such a way that the instant at which its radius is 20 cm, its radius is
decreasing at 3 cm/min. At what rate is the volume of the ball of snow changing at that instant?
Solution
Since the snowball is spherical, we again have that
V = 4
3πr3.
We can no longer write a formula for r in terms of t, but we know that
dr
dt = −3
when
r = 20.
We want to know dV/dt when r = 20. Think of r as an (unknown) function of t and differentiate
the expression for V with respect to t using the chain rule:
dV
dt = 4
3π · 3r2 dr
dt = 4πr2 dr
dt .
At the instant at which r = 20 and dr/dt = −3, we have
dV
dt = 4π · 202 · (−3) = −4800π ≈−15,080 cm3/min.
So the volume of the ball is decreasing at a rate of 15,080 cm3 per minute at the moment when
r = 20 cm. Notice that we have sidestepped the problem of not knowing r as a function of t by
calculating the derivatives only at the moment we are interested in.

Figure 4.83 shows the fuel consumption, g, in miles per gallon (mpg), of a car traveling at v mph.

Figure 4.83: Fuel consumption versus velocity
Solution
Acceleration is rate of change of velocity, dv/dt, and we are told that the deceleration is 8000
miles/hour2, so we know dv/dt = −8000 when v = 70. We want dg/dt. The chain rule gives
dg
dt = dg
dv · dv
dt .

The value of dg/dv is the slope of the curve in Figure 4.83 at v = 70. Since the points (30, 40) and
(100, 20) lie approximately on the tangent to the curve at v = 70, we can estimate the derivative
dg
dv ≈20 −40
100 −30 = −2
7 mpg/mph.
Thus,
dg
dt = dg
dv · dv
dt ≈−2
7(−8000) ≈2300 mpg/hr.
In other words, fuel consumption is increasing at about 2300/60 ≈38 mpg per minute. Since we
approximated dg/dv, we can only get a rough estimate for dg/dt.
A famous problem involves the rate at which the top of a ladder slips down a wall as the foot
of the ladder moves.
Example 5
(a) A 3-meter ladder stands against a high wall. The foot of the ladder moves outward at a constant
speed of 0.1 meter/sec. When the foot is 1 meter from the wall, how fast is the top of the ladder
falling? What about when the foot is 2 meters from the wall?
(b) If the foot of the ladder moves out at a constant speed, how does the speed at which the top falls
change as the foot gets farther out?
Solution
(a) Let the foot be x meters from the base of the wall and let the top be y meters from the base. See
Figure 4.84. Then, since the ladder is 3 meters long, by Pythagoras’ Theorem,
x2 + y2 = 32 = 9.
Thinking of x and y as functions of t, we differentiate with respect to t using the chain rule:
2xdx
dt + 2y dy
dt = 0.
We are interested in the moment at which dx/dt = 0.1 and x = 1. We want to know dy/dt, so
we solve, giving
dy
dt = −x
y
dx
dt .
When the foot of the ladder is 1 meter from the wall, x = 1 and y =
√
9 −12 =
√
8, so
dy
dt = −1
√
80.1 = −0.035 meter/sec.
Thus, the top falls at 0.035 meter/sec.
When the foot is 2 meters from the wall, x = 2 and y =
√
9 −22 =
√
5, so
dy
dt = −2
√
50.1 = −0.089 meter/sec.
Thus, the top falls at 0.089 meter/sec. Notice that the top falls faster when the base of the ladder
is farther from the wall.
(b) As the foot of the ladder moves out, x increases and y decreases. Looking at the expression
dy
dt = −x
y
dx
dt ,
we see that if dx/dt is constant, the magnitude of dy/dt increases as the foot gets farther out.
Thus, the top falls faster and faster.

An airplane, ﬂying at 450 km/hr at a constant altitude of 5 km, is approaching a camera mounted
on the ground. Let θ be the angle of elevation above the ground at which the camera is pointed. See
Figure 4.85. When θ = π/3, how fast does the camera have to rotate in order to keep the plane in
view?
Solution
Suppose the camera is at point C and the plane is vertically above point B. Let x km be the distance
between B and C. The fact that the plane is moving horizontally toward C at 450 km/hr means that
x is decreasing and dx/dt = −450 km/hr. From Figure 4.85, we see that tan θ = 5/x.

51. In a romantic relationship between Angela and Brian,
who are unsuited for each other, a(t) represents the affec-
tion Angela has for Brian at time t days after they meet,
while b(t) represents the affection Brian has for Angela
at time t. If a(t) > 0 then Angela likes Brian; if a(t) < 0
then Angela dislikes Brian; if a(t) = 0 then Angela
neither likes nor dislikes Brian. Their affection for each
other is given by the relation (a(t))2 + (b(t))2 = c,
where c is a constant.
(a) Show that a(t) · a′(t) = −b(t) · b′(t).
(b) At any time during their relationship, the rate per
day at which Brian’s affection for Angela changes is
b′(t) = −a(t). Explain what this means if Angela

52. In a 19th century sea-battle, the number of ships on each
side remaining t hours after the start are given by x(t)
and y(t). If the ships are equally equipped, the relation

itive constant. The battle ends when one side has no ships
remaining.
(a) If, at the start of the battle, 50 ships on one side op-
pose 40 ships on the other, what is the value of c?
(b) If y(3) = 16, what is x(3)? What does this represent
in terms of the battle?

represent in terms of the battle?
(d) At the end of the battle, how many ships remain on
the victorious side?

k. Write an equation that represents this. Is k posi-
tive or negative?

L’HOPITAL’S RULE, GROWTH, AND DOMINANCE
Suppose we want to calculate the exact value of the limit
lim
x→0
e2x −1
x
.
Substituting x = 0 gives us 0/0, which is undeﬁned:
e2(0) −1
0
= 1 −1
0
= 0
0.
Substituting values of x near 0 gives us an approximate value for the limit.
However, the limit can be calculated exactly using local linearity. Suppose we let f(x) be the
numerator, so f(x) = e2x −1, and g(x) be the denominator, so g(x) = x. Then f(0) = 0 and
f ′(x) = 2e2x, so f ′(0) = 2. When we zoom in on the graph of f(x) = e2x −1 near the origin, we
see its tangent line y = 2x shown in Figure 4.96. We are interested in the ratio f(x)/g(x), which is
approximately the ratio of the y-values in Figure 4.96. So, for x near 0,
f(x)
g(x) = e2x −1
x
≈2x
x = 2
1 = f ′(0)
g′(0) .
As x →0, this approximation gets better, and we have
lim
x→0
e2x −1
x
= 2.

L’Hopital’s Rule
If f(a) = g(a) = 0, we can use the same method to investigate limits of the form
lim
x→a
f(x)
g(x) .
As in the previous case, we zoom in on the graphs of f(x) and g(x). Figure 4.97 shows that both
graphs cross the x-axis at x = a. This suggests that the limit of f(x)/g(x) as x →a is the ratio of
slopes, giving the following result:
L’Hopital’s rule:12 If f and g are differentiable, f(a) = g(a) = 0, and g′(a) ̸= 0, then
lim
x→a
f(x)
g(x) = f ′(a)
g′(a) .
Example 1
Use l’Hopital’s rule to conﬁrm that lim
x→0
sin x
x
= 1.
Solution
Let f(x) = sin x and g(x) = x. Then f(0) = g(0) = 0 and f ′(x) = cos x and g′(x) = 1. Thus,
lim
x→0
sin x
x
= cos 0
1
= 1.
If we also have f ′(a) = g′(a) = 0, then we can use the following result:
More general form of l’Hopital’s rule: If f and g are differentiable and f(a) = g(a) = 0,
then
lim
x→a
f(x)
g(x) = lim
x→a
f ′(x)
g′(x) ,
provided the limit on the right exists.
Example 2
Calculate lim
t→0
et −1 −t
t2
.
Solution
Let f(t) = et −1 −t and g(t) = t2. Then f(0) = e0 −1 −0 = 0 and g(0) = 0, and f ′(t) = et −1
and g′(t) = 2t. So
lim
t→0
et −1 −t
t2
= lim
t→0
et −1
2t
.
12Marquis de l’Hopital (1661–1704) was a French nobleman who wrote the ﬁrst calculus text.

244
Chapter Four USING THE DERIVATIVE
Since f ′(0) = g′(0) = 0, the ratio f ′(0)/g′(0) is not deﬁned. So we use l’Hopital’s rule again:
lim
t→0
et −1 −t
t2
= lim
t→0
et −1
2t
= lim
t→0
et
2 = 1
2.
We can also use l’Hopital’s rule in cases involving inﬁnity.
L’Hopital’s rule applies to limits involving inﬁnity, provided f and g are differentiable.
For a any real number or ±∞:
• When limx→a f(x) = ±∞and limx→a g(x) = ±∞,
or
• When lim
x→∞f(x) = lim
x→∞g(x) = 0.
it can be shown that:
lim
x→a
f(x)
g(x) = lim
x→a
f ′(x)
g′(x) ,
provided the limit on the right-hand side exists.
The next example shows how this version of l’Hopital’s rule is used.
Example 3
Calculate lim
x→∞
5x + e−x
7x
.
Solution
Let f(x) = 5x + e−x and g(x) = 7x. Then lim
x→∞f(x) = lim
x→∞g(x) = ∞, and f ′(x) = 5 −e−x
and g′(x) = 7, so
lim
x→∞
5x + e−x
7x
= lim
x→∞
(5 −e−x)
7
= 5

Dominance: Powers, Polynomials, Exponentials, and Logarithms
In Chapter 1, we see that some functions are much larger than others as x →∞. For positive
functions f and g, we say that g dominates f as x →∞if lim
x→∞
f(x)
g(x) = 0. L’Hopital’s rule gives
us an easy way of checking this.
Example 4
Check that x1/2 dominates ln x as x →∞.
Solution
We apply l’Hopital’s rule to (ln x)/x1/2:
lim
x→∞
ln x
x1/2 = lim
x→∞
1/x
1
2x−1/2 .
To evaluate this limit, we simplify and get
lim
x→∞
1/x
1
2x−1/2 = lim
x→∞
2x1/2
x
= lim
x→∞
2
x1/2 = 0.
Therefore we have
lim
x→∞
ln x
x1/2 = 0,
which tells us that x1/2 dominates ln x as x →∞.
Example 5
Check that any exponential function of the form ekx (with k > 0) dominates any power function of
the form Axp (with A and p positive) as x →∞.

4.7 L’HOPITAL’S RULE, GROWTH, AND DOMINANCE
245
Solution
We apply l’Hopital’s rule repeatedly to Axp/ekx:
lim
x→∞
Axp
ekx = lim
x→∞
Apxp−1
kekx
= lim
x→∞
Ap(p −1)xp−2
k2ekx
= · · ·
Keep applying l’Hopital’s rule until the power of x is no longer positive. Then the limit of the
numerator must be a ﬁnite number, while the limit of the denominator must be ∞. Therefore we
have
lim
x→∞
Axp
ekx = 0,
so ekx dominates Axp.
Recognizing the Form of a Limit
Although expressions like 0/0 and ∞/∞have no numerical value, they are useful in describing the
form of a limit. We can also use l’Hopital’s rule to calculate some limits of the form 0 · ∞, ∞−∞,
1∞, 00, and ∞0.
Example 6
Calculate lim
x→∞xe−x.
Solution
Since lim
x→∞x = ∞and lim
x→∞e−x = 0, we see that
xe−x →∞· 0
as x →∞.
Rewriting
∞· 0
as
∞

0

∞
gives a form whose value can be determined using l’Hopital’s rule, so we rewrite the function xe−x
as
xe−x = x
ex →∞
∞
as x →∞.
Taking f(x) = x and g(x) = ex gives f ′(x) = 1 and g′(x) = ex, so
lim
x→∞xe−x = lim
x→∞
x
ex = lim
x→∞
1
ex = 0.

Solution
As x →∞, we see that

Since ln 1∞= ∞· ln 1 = ∞· 0, we write

as

Since limx→∞ln(1 + 1/x) = 0 and limx→∞(1/x) = 0, we can use l’Hopital’s rule with f(x) =
ln(1 + 1/x) and g(x) = 1/x. We have
f ′(x) =
1
1 + 1/x

Since limx→∞ln y = 1, we have

Example 8
Put the following limits in a form that can be evaluated using l’Hopital’s rule:
(a)
lim
x→0+ x ln x
(b)
lim
x→∞x1/x
(c)
lim
x→0+ xx
(d)
lim
x→0
1
x −
1
sin x
Solution
(a) We have
lim
x→0+ x ln x = 0 · ∞.
We can rewrite
0 · ∞
as
∞
1/0 = ∞
∞.
This corresponds to rewriting
lim
x→0+ x ln x
as
lim
x→0+
ln x
1/x.
This is an ∞/∞form that can be evaluated using l’Hopital’s rule. (Note that we could also have
written
0 · ∞
as
0
1/∞= 0
0,
but this leads to rewriting
lim
x→0+ x ln x
as
lim
x→0+
x
1/ln x.
It turns out that l’Hopital’s rule fails to simplify this limit.)
(b) In this case we have a ∞0 form, so we take the logarithm and get a 0 · ∞form:
lim
x→∞ln(x1/x) = lim
x→∞
1
x ln x = lim
x→∞
ln x
x .
This is an ∞/∞form that can be evaluated using l’Hopital’s rule. Once we get the answer, we
exponentiate it to get the original limit.
(c) Since limx→0+ x = 0, this is a 00 form. If we take the logarithm, we get
ln 00 = 0 · ln 0 = 0 · ∞.
This corresponds to the limit
lim
x→0+ ln xx = lim
x→0+ x ln x,
which is considered in part (a).

PARAMETRIC EQUATIONS
Representing Motion in the Plane
To represent the motion of a particle in the xy-plane we use two equations, one for the x-coordinate
of the particle, x = f(t), and another for the y-coordinate, y = g(t). Thus at time t the particle
is at the point (f(t), g(t)). The equation for x describes the right-left motion; the equation for y
describes the up-down motion. The two equations for x and y are called parametric equations with
parameter t.
Example 1
Describe the motion of the particle whose coordinates at time t are x = cos t and y = sin t.
Solution
Since (cos t)2 + (sin t)2 = 1, we have x2 + y2 = 1. That is, at any time t the particle is at a point
(x, y) on the unit circle x2 + y2 = 1. We plot points at different times to see how the particle moves
on the circle. (See Figure 4.99 and Table 4.5.) The particle completes one full trip counterclockwise
around the circle every 2π units of time. Notice how the x-coordinate goes repeatedly back and forth
from −1 to 1 while the y-coordinate goes repeatedly up and down from −1 to 1. The two motions
combine to trace out a circle.

Figure 4.101
Solution
Between times t = 0 and t = 1, the x-coordinate goes from 0 to 1, while the y-coordinate stays
ﬁxed at 0. So the particle moves along the x-axis from (0, 0) to (1, 0). Then, between times t = 1
and t = 2, the x-coordinate stays ﬁxed at x = 1, while the y-coordinate goes from 0 to 1. Thus,
the particle moves along the vertical line from (1, 0) to (1, 1). Similarly, between times t = 2 and
t = 3, it moves horizontally back to (0, 1), and between times t = 3 and t = 4 it moves down the
y-axis to (0, 0). Thus, it traces out the square in Figure 4.101.

Different Motions Along the Same Path
Example 3
Describe the motion of the particle whose x and y coordinates at time t are given by the equations
x = cos(3t),
y = sin(3t).
Solution
Since (cos(3t))2 + (sin(3t))2 = 1, we have x2 + y2 = 1, giving motion around the unit circle. But
from Table 4.6, we see that the particle in this example is moving three times as fast as the particle
in Example 1. (See Figure 4.102.)

Example 3 is obtained from Example 1 by replacing t by 3t; this is called a change in parameter.
If we make a change in parameter, the particle traces out the same curve (or a part of it) but at a
different speed or in a different direction.
Example 4
Describe the motion of the particle whose x and y coordinates at time t are given by
x = cos(e−t2),
y = sin(e−t2).
Solution
As in Examples 1 and 3, we have x2 + y2 = 1 so the motion lies on the unit circle. As time t goes
from −∞(way back in the past) to 0 (the present) to ∞(way off in the future), e−t2 goes from
near 0 to 1 back to near 0. So (x, y) = (cos(e−t2), sin(e−t2)) goes from near (1, 0) to (cos 1, sin 1)
and back to near (1, 0). The particle does not actually reach the point (1, 0). (See Figure 4.103 and
Table 4.7.)

Motion in a Straight Line
An object moves with constant speed along a straight line through the point (x0, y0). Both the x-
and y-coordinates have a constant rate of change. Let a = dx/dt and b = dy/dt. Then at time t the
object has coordinates x = x0 + at, y = y0 + bt. (See Figure 4.104.) Notice that a represents the
change in x in one unit of time, and b represents the change in y. Thus the line has slope m = b/a.

Parametric Equations for a Straight Line
An object moving along a line through the point (x0, y0), with dx/dt = a and dy/dt = b,
has parametric equations
x = x0 + at,
y = y0 + bt.
The slope of the line is m = b/a.
Example 5
Find parametric equations for:
(a) The line passing through the points (2, −1) and (−1, 5).
(b) The line segment from (2, −1) to (−1, 5).
Solution
(a) Imagine an object moving with constant speed along a straight line from (2, −1) to (−1, 5),
making the journey from the ﬁrst point to the second in one unit of time. Then dx/dt = ((−1)−
2)/1 = −3 and dy/dt = (5 −(−1))/1 = 6. Thus the parametric equations are
x = 2 −3t,
y = −1 + 6t.

252
Chapter Four USING THE DERIVATIVE
(b) In the parameterization in part (a), t = 0 corresponds to the point (2, −1) and t = 1 corresponds
to the point (−1, 5). So the parameterization of the segment is
x = 2 −3t,
y = −1 + 6t,
0 ≤t ≤1.
There are many other possible parametric equations for this line.
Speed and Velocity
An object moves along a straight line at a constant speed, with dx/dt = a and dy/dt = b. In one
unit of time, the object moves a units horizontally and b units vertically. Thus, by the Pythagorean
Theorem, it travels a distance
√
a2 + b2. So its speed is
Speed = Distance traveled
Time taken
=
√
a2 + b2

=

a2 + b2.
For general motion along a curve with varying speed, we make the following deﬁnition:
The instantaneous speed of a moving object is deﬁned to be
v =
$dx
dt
2
+
dy
dt
2
.
The quantity vx = dx/dt is the instantaneous velocity in the x-direction; vy = dy/dt is the
instantaneous velocity in the y-direction. The velocity vector ⃗v is written ⃗v = vx⃗i + vy⃗j .
The quantities vx and vy are called the components of the velocity in the x- and y-directions.
The velocity vector ⃗v is a useful way to keep track of the velocities in both directions using one
mathematical object. The symbols ⃗i and ⃗j represent vectors of length one in the positive x and
y-directions, respectively. For more about vectors, see Appendix D.
Example 6
A particle moves along a curve in the xy-plane with x(t) = 2t + et and y(t) = 3t −4, where t is
time. Find the velocity vector and speed of the particle when t = 1.
Solution
Differentiating gives
dx
dt = 2 + et,
dy
dt = 3.
When t = 1 we have vx = 2 + e, vy = 3. So the velocity vector is ⃗v = (2 + e)⃗i + 3⃗j and the
speed is

(2 + e)2 + 32 =
√
13 + 4e + e2 = 5.591.
Example 7

time.
(a) At what times is the particle

(b) Find the speed of the particle at time t.
Solution
(a) Differentiating gives
dx
dt = 6t2 −18t + 12,
dy
dt = 12t3 −48t2 + 36t.
We are interested in the points at which dx/dt = 0 or dy/dt = 0. Solving gives
dx
dt =
6(t2 −3t + 2) =
6(t −1)(t −2)
so
dx
dt = 0
if t = 1 or t = 2.
dy
dt = 12t(t2 −4t + 3) = 12t(t −1)(t −3)
so
dy

if t = 0, t = 1, or t = 3.

(i) The particle is stopped if both dx/dt and dy/dt are 0, which occurs at t = 1.
(ii) The particle is moving parallel to the x-axis if dy/dt = 0 but dx/dt ̸= 0. This occurs at
t = 0 and t = 3. The particle is moving parallel to the y-axis if dx/dt = 0 but dy/dt ̸= 0.
This occurs at t = 2.

A child is sitting on a Ferris wheel of diameter 10 meters, making one revolution every 2 minutes.
Find the speed of the child
(a)
Using geometry.
(b)
Using a parameterization of the motion.
Solution
(a) The child moves at a constant speed around a circle of radius 5 meters, completing one revo-
lution every 2 minutes. One revolution around a circle of radius 5 is a distance of 10π, so the
child’s speed is 10π/2 = 5π ≈15.7 m/min. See Figure 4.105.

Figure 4.105: Motion of a child on a Ferris wheel at two different times is represented by
the arrows. The direction of each arrow is the direction of motion at that time.
(b) The Ferris wheel has radius 5 meters and completes 1 revolution counterclockwise every 2
minutes. If the origin is at the center of the circle and we measure x and y in meters, the motion
is parameterized by equations of the form
x = 5 cos(ωt),
y = 5 sin(ωt),
where ω is chosen to make the period 2 minutes. Since the period of cos(ωt) and sin(ωt) is
2π/ω, we must have
2π
ω = 2,
so
ω = π.
Thus, for t in minutes, the motion is described by the equations
x = 5 cos(πt),
y = 5 sin(πt).
So the speed is given by

sin2(πt) + cos2(πt) = 5π ≈15.7 m/min,
which agrees with the speed we calculated in part (a).
Tangent Lines
To ﬁnd the tangent line at a point (x0, y0) to a curve given parametrically, we ﬁnd the straight line
motion through (x0, y0) with the same velocity in the x and y directions as a particle moving along
the curve.
Example 9
Find the tangent line at the point (1, 2) to the curve deﬁned by the parametric equations
x = t3,
y = 2t.

254
Chapter Four USING THE DERIVATIVE
Solution
At time t = 1 the particle is at the point (1, 2). The velocity in the x-direction at time t is vx =
dx/dt = 3t2, and the velocity in the y-direction is vy = dy/dt = 2. So at t = 1 the velocity in
the x-direction is 3 and the velocity in the y-direction is 2. Thus the tangent line has parametric
equations
x = 1 + 3t,
y = 2 + 2t.
Parametric Representations of Curves in the Plane
Sometimes we are more interested in the curve traced out by the particle than we are in the motion
itself. In that case we call the parametric equations a parameterization of the curve. As we can see
by comparing Examples 1 and 3, two different parameterizations can describe the same curve in the
xy-plane. Though the parameter, which we usually denote by t, may not have physical meaning, it
is often helpful to think of it as time.

Figure 4.107: Parameterization of the
ellipse 4x2 + y2 = 1 for Example 11
Solution
We can use the equations x = cos t and y = sin t for counterclockwise motion in a circle, from
Example 1 on page 249. The particle passes (0, 1) at t = π/2, moves counterclockwise around the
circle, and reaches (0, −1) at t = 3π/2. So a parameterization is
x = cos t, y = sin t,
π
2 ≤t ≤3π
2 .
To ﬁnd the xy-equation of a curve given parametrically, we eliminate the parameter t in the
parametric equations. In the previous example, we use the Pythagorean identity, so
cos2 t + sin2 t = 1
gives
x2 + y2 = 1.
Example 11
Give a parameterization of the ellipse 4x2 + y2 = 1 shown in Figure 4.107.
Solution
Since (2x)2 + y2 = 1, we adapt the parameterization of the circle in Example 1. Replacing x by 2x
gives the equations 2x = cos t, y = sin t. A parameterization of the ellipse is thus
x = 1
2 cos t,
y = sin t,
0 ≤t ≤2π.
We usually require that the parameterization of a curve go from one end of the curve to the
other without retracing any portion of the curve. This is different from parameterizing the motion
of a particle, where, for example, a particle may move around the same circle many times.
Parameterizing the Graph of a Function
The graph of any function y = f(x) can be parameterized by letting the parameter t be x:
x = t,
y = f(t).

4.8 PARAMETRIC EQUATIONS
255
Example 12
Give parametric equations for the curve y = x3 −x. In which direction does this parameterization
trace out the curve?
Solution
Let x = t, y = t3 −t. Thus, y = t3 −t = x3 −x. Since x = t, as time increases the x-coordinate
moves from left to right, so the particle traces out the curve y = x3 −x from left to right.
Curves Given Parametrically
Some complicated curves can be graphed more easily using parametric equations; the next example
shows such a curve.
Example 13
Assume t is time in seconds. Sketch the curve traced out by the particle whose motion is given by
x = cos(3t),
y = sin(5t).
Solution
The x-coordinate oscillates back and forth between 1 and −1, completing 3 oscillations every 2π
seconds. The y-coordinate oscillates up and down between 1 and −1, completing 5 oscillations
every 2π seconds. Since both the x- and y-coordinates return to their original values every 2π
seconds, the curve is retraced every 2π seconds. The result is a pattern called a Lissajous ﬁgure.
(See Figure 4.108.) Problems 57–60 concern Lissajous ﬁgures x = cos(at), y = sin(bt) for other
values of a and b.

Slope and Concavity of Parametric Curves
Suppose we have a curve traced out by the parametric equations x = f(t), y = g(t). To ﬁnd the
slope at a point on the curve, we could, in theory, eliminate the parameter t and then differentiate
the function we obtain. However, the chain rule gives us an easier way.
Suppose the curve traced out by the parametric equations is represented by y = h(x). (It may
be represented by an implicit function.) Thinking of x and y as functions of t, the chain rule gives
dy
dt = dy
dx · dx
dt ,
so we obtain the slope of the curve as a function of t:
Slope of curve = dy
dx = dy/dt
dx/dt.
We can ﬁnd the second derivative, d2y/dx2, by a similar method and use it to investigate the con-
cavity of the curve. The chain rule tells us that if w is any differentiable function of x, then
dw
dx = dw/dt
dx/dt .

256

Example 14
If x = cos t, y = sin t, ﬁnd the point corresponding to t = π/4, the slope of the curve at the point,
and d2y/dx2 at the point.
Solution
The point corresponding to t = π/4 is (cos(π/4), sin(π/4)) = (1/
√
2, 1/
√
2).
To ﬁnd the slope, we use
dy
dx = dy/dt
dx/dt =
cos t
−sin t,
so when t = π/4,
Slope =
cos(π/4)
−sin(π/4) = −1.
Thus, the curve has slope −1 at the point (1/
√
2, 1/
√
2). This is as we would expect, since the curve
traced out is the circle of Example 1.
To ﬁnd d2y/dx2, we use w = dy/dx = −(cos t)/(sin t), so

Since the second derivative is negative, the concavity is negative. This is as expected, since the point

1. Medical Case Study: Impact of Asthma on Breathing13
Asthma is a common breathing disease in which inﬂammation in the airways of the lungs
causes episodes of shortness of breath, coughing, and chest tightness. Patients with asthma
often have wheezing, an abnormal sound heard on exhalation due to turbulent airﬂow. Turbulent
airﬂow is caused by swelling, mucus secretion, and constriction of muscle in the walls of the
airways, shrinking the radius of the air passages leading to increased resistance to airﬂow and
making it harder for patients to exhale.
An important breathing test for asthma is called spirometry. In this test, a patient takes in as
deep a breath as he or she can, and then exhales as rapidly, forcefully, and for as long as possible
through a tube connected to an analyzer. The analyzer measures a number of parameters and
generates two graphs.
(a) Figure 4.123 is a volume-time curve for an asthma-free patient, showing the volume of air
exhaled, V , as a function of time, t, since the test began.14
(i) What is the physical interpretation of the slope of the volume-time curve?
(ii) The volume VC shown on the volume-time graph is called the (forced) vital capacity
(FVC or simply VC). Describe the physical meaning of VC.
(b) Figure 4.124 is the ﬂow-volume curve for the same patient.15 The ﬂow-volume curve shows
the ﬂow rate, dV/dt, of air as a function of V , the volume of air exhaled.
(i) What is the physical interpretation of the slope of the ﬂow-volume curve?
(ii) Describe how the slope of the ﬂow-volume curve changes as V increases from 0 to
5.5 liters. Explain what this means for the patient’s breath.
(iii) Sketch the slope of the ﬂow-volume curve.
(iv) What is the volume of air that has been exhaled when the ﬂow rate is a maximum, and
what is that maximal rate, the peak expiratory ﬂow? Explain how this maximal rate is
identiﬁed on the ﬂow-volume curve and how the volume at which the maximal rate
occurs is identiﬁed on the slope curve in part (b)(iii).
(c) How do you imagine the volume-time curve and the ﬂow-volume curve would be different
for a patient with acute asthma? Draw curves to illustrate your thinking.

4. Firebreaks
The summer of 2000 was devastating for forests in the western US: over 3.5 million acres of
trees were lost to ﬁres, making this the worst ﬁre season in 30 years. This project studies a
ﬁre management technique called ﬁrebreaks, which reduce the damage done by forest ﬁres. A
ﬁrebreak is a strip where trees have been removed in a forest so that a ﬁre started on one side of
the strip will not spread to the other side. Having many ﬁrebreaks helps conﬁne a ﬁre to a small
area. On the other hand, having too many ﬁrebreaks involves removing large swaths of trees.17
(a) A forest in the shape of a 50 km by 50 km square has ﬁrebreaks in rectangular strips 50 km
by 0.01 km. The trees between two ﬁrebreaks are called a stand of trees. All ﬁrebreaks in
this forest are parallel to each other and to one edge of the forest, with the ﬁrst ﬁrebreak at
the edge of the forest. The ﬁrebreaks are evenly spaced throughout the forest. (For example,
Figure 4.126 shows four ﬁrebreaks.) The total area lost in the case of a ﬁre is the area of
the stand of trees in which the ﬁre started plus the area of all the ﬁrebreaks.

HOW DO WE MEASURE DISTANCE TRAVELED?
For positive constant velocities, we can ﬁnd the distance a moving object travels using the formula
Distance = Velocity × Time.
In this section we see how to estimate the distance when the velocity is not a constant.
A Thought Experiment: How Far Did the Car Go?
Velocity Data Every Two Seconds
A car is moving with increasing velocity. Table 5.1 shows the velocity every two seconds:

How far has the car traveled? Since we don’t know how fast the car is moving at every moment,
we can’t calculate the distance exactly, but we can make an estimate. The velocity is increasing, so
the car is going at least 20 ft/sec for the ﬁrst two seconds. Since Distance = Velocity × Time, the
car goes at least 20 · 2 = 40 feet during the ﬁrst two seconds. Likewise, it goes at least 30 · 2 = 60
feet during the next two seconds, and so on. During the ten-second period it goes at least
20 · 2 + 30 · 2 + 38 · 2 + 44 · 2 + 48 · 2 = 360 feet.
Thus, 360 feet is an underestimate of the total distance traveled during the ten seconds.
To get an overestimate, we can reason this way: During the ﬁrst two seconds, the car’s velocity
is at most 30 ft/sec, so it moved at most 30 · 2 = 60 feet. In the next two seconds it moved at most
38 · 2 = 76 feet, and so on. Therefore, over the ten-second period it moved at most
30 · 2 + 38 · 2 + 44 · 2 + 48 · 2 + 50 · 2 = 420 feet.
Therefore,
360 feet ≤Total distance traveled ≤420 feet.
There is a difference of 60 feet between the upper and lower estimates.
Velocity Data Every One Second
What if we want a more accurate estimate? Then we make more frequent velocity measurements,
say every second, as in Table 5.2.
As before, we get a lower estimate for each second by using the velocity at the beginning of that
second. During the ﬁrst second the velocity is at least 20 ft/sec, so the car travels at least 20 · 1 = 20
feet. During the next second the car moves at least 26 feet, and so on. We have
New lower estimate = 20 · 1 + 26 · 1 + 30 · 1 + 34 · 1 + 38 · 1
+ 41 · 1 + 44 · 1 + 46 · 1 + 48 · 1 + 49 · 1
= 376 feet.

5.1 HOW DO WE MEASURE DISTANCE TRAVELED?
273
Notice that this lower estimate is greater than the old lower estimate of 360 feet.
We get a new upper estimate by considering the velocity at the end of each second. During the
ﬁrst second the velocity is at most 26 ft/sec, so the car moves at most 26 · 1 = 26 feet; in the next
second it moves at most 30 feet, and so on.
New upper estimate = 26 · 1 + 30 · 1 + 34 · 1 + 38 · 1 + 41 · 1
+ 44 · 1 + 46 · 1 + 48 · 1 + 49 · 1 + 50 · 1
= 406 feet.
This is less than the old upper estimate of 420 feet. Now we know that
376 feet ≤Total distance traveled ≤406 feet.
The difference between upper and lower estimates is now 30 feet, half of what it was before. By
halving the interval of measurement, we have halved the difference between the upper and lower
estimates.
Visualizing Distance on the Velocity Graph: Two-Second Data
We can represent both upper and lower estimates on a graph of the velocity. The graph also shows
how changing the time interval between velocity measurements changes the accuracy of our esti-
mates.
The velocity can be graphed by plotting the two-second data in Table 5.1 and drawing a curve
through the data points. (See Figure 5.1.) The area of the ﬁrst dark rectangle is 20·2 = 40, the lower
estimate of the distance moved during the ﬁrst two seconds. The area of the second dark rectangle is
30 · 2 = 60, the lower estimate for the distance moved in the next two seconds. The total area of the
dark rectangles represents the lower estimate for the total distance moved during the ten seconds.
If the dark and light rectangles are considered together, the ﬁrst area is 30 · 2 = 60, the upper
estimate for the distance moved in the ﬁrst two seconds. The second area is 38 · 2 = 76, the upper
estimate for the next two seconds. The upper estimate for the total distance is represented by the
sum of the areas of the dark and light rectangles. Therefore, the area of the light rectangles alone
represents the difference between the two estimates.
To visualize the difference between the two estimates, look at Figure 5.1 and imagine the light
rectangles all pushed to the right and stacked on top of each other. This gives a rectangle of width 2
and height 30. The height, 30, is the difference between the initial and ﬁnal values of the velocity:
30 = 50 −20. The width, 2, is the time interval between velocity measurements.

Figure 5.2: Velocity measured every second
Visualizing Distance on the Velocity Graph: One-Second Data
Figure 5.2 shows the velocities measured every second. The area of the dark rectangles again rep-
resents the lower estimate, and the area of the dark and light rectangles together represent the upper
estimate. As before, the difference between the two estimates is represented by the area of the light
rectangles. This difference can be calculated by stacking the light rectangles vertically, giving a
rectangle of the same height as before but of half the width. Its area is therefore half what it was
before. Again, the height of this stack is 50 −20 = 30, but its width is now 1.
Example 1
What would be the difference between the upper and lower estimates if the velocity were given
every tenth of a second? Every hundredth of a second? Every thousandth of a second?
Solution
Every tenth of a second: Difference between estimates = (50 −20)(1/10) = 3 feet.
Every hundredth of a second: Difference between estimates = (50 −20)(1/100) = 0.3 feet.
Every thousandth of a second: Difference between estimates = (50 −20)(1/1000) = 0.03 feet.
Example 2
How frequently must the velocity be recorded in order to estimate the total distance traveled to
within 0.1 feet?
Solution
The difference between the velocity at the beginning and end of the observation period is 50−20 =
30. If the time between successive measurements is Δt, then the difference between the upper and
lower estimates is (30)Δt. We want
(30)Δt < 0.1,
or
Δt < 0.1
30 = 0.0033.
So if the measurements are made less than 0.0033 seconds apart, the distance estimate is accurate
to within 0.1 feet.
Visualizing Distance on the Velocity Graph: Area Under Curve
As we make more frequent velocity measurements, the rectangles used to estimate the distance trav-
eled ﬁt the curve more closely. See Figures 5.3 and 5.4. In the limit, as the number of subdivisions
increases, we see that the distance traveled is given by the area between the velocity curve and the
horizontal axis. See Figure 5.5. In general:
If the velocity is positive, the total distance traveled is the area under the velocity curve.

Example 3
With time t in seconds, the velocity of a bicycle, in feet per second, is given by v(t) = 5t. How far
does the bicycle travel in 3 seconds?
Solution
The velocity is linear. See Figure 5.6. The distance traveled is the area between the line v(t) = 5t
and the t-axis. Since this region is a triangle of height 15 and base 3,
Distance traveled = Area of triangle = 1

Negative Velocity and Change in Position
In the thought experiment, the velocity is positive and our sums represent distance traveled. What if
the velocity is sometimes negative?
Example 4
A particle moves along the y-axis with velocity 30 cm/sec for 5 seconds and velocity −10 cm/sec for
the next 5 seconds. Positive velocity indicates upward motion; negative velocity represents down-
ward motion. What is represented by the sum
30 · 5 + (−10) · 5?
Solution
The ﬁrst term in the sum represents an upward motion of 30·5 = 150 centimeters. The second term
represents a motion of (−10) · 5 = −50 centimeters, that is, 50 centimeters downward. Thus, the
sum represents a change in position of 150 −50 = 100 centimeters upward.
Figure 5.7 shows velocity versus time. The area of the rectangle above the t-axis represents
upward distance, while the area of the rectangle below the t-axis represents downward distance.

Chapter Five KEY CONCEPT: THE DEFINITE INTEGRAL
In general, if the velocity can be negative as well as positive, the limit of the sums represents
change in position, rather than distance traveled.
Left and Right Sums
We now write the estimates for the distance traveled by the car in new notation. Let v = f(t) denote
any nonnegative velocity function. We want to ﬁnd the distance traveled between times t = a and
t = b. We take measurements of f(t) at equally spaced times t0, t1, t2, ..., tn, with time t0 = a
and time tn = b. The time interval between any two consecutive measurements is
Δt = b −a
n
,
where Δt means the change, or increment, in t.
During the ﬁrst time interval, from t0 and t1, the velocity can be approximated by f(t0), so the
distance traveled is approximately
f(t0)Δt.
During the second time interval, the velocity is about f(t1), so the distance traveled is about
f(t1)Δt.
Continuing in this way and adding all the estimates, we get an estimate for the total distance traveled.
In the last interval, the velocity is approximately f(tn−1), so the last term is f(tn−1)Δt:
Total distance traveled
between t = a and t = b
≈f(t0)Δt + f(t1)Δt + f(t2)Δt + · · · + f(tn−1)Δt.
This is called a left-hand sum because we used the value of velocity from the left end of each time
interval. It is represented by the sum of the areas of the rectangles in Figure 5.8.
We can also calculate a right-hand sum by using the value of the velocity at the right end of
each time interval. In that case the estimate for the ﬁrst interval is f(t1)Δt, for the second interval
it is f(t2)Δt, and so on. The estimate for the last interval is now f(tn)Δt, so
Total distance traveled
between t = a and t = b
≈f(t1)Δt + f(t2)Δt + f(t3)Δt + · · · + f(tn)Δt.
The right-hand sum is represented by the area of the rectangles in Figure 5.9.
If f is an increasing function, as in Figures 5.8 and 5.9, the left-hand sum is an underestimate
and the right-hand sum is an overestimate of the total distance traveled. If f is decreasing, as in
Figure 5.10, then the roles of the two sums are reversed.

Accuracy of Estimates
For either increasing or decreasing velocity functions, the exact value of the distance traveled lies
somewhere between the two estimates. Thus, the accuracy of our estimate depends on how close
these two sums are. For a function which is increasing throughout or decreasing throughout the
interval [a, b]:


(Absolute values make the differences nonnegative.) In Figure 5.10, the area of the light rectangles
is the difference between estimates. By making the time interval, Δt, between measurements small
enough, we can make this difference between lower and upper estimates as small as we like.

THE DEFINITE INTEGRAL
In Section 5.1, we saw how distance traveled can be approximated by a sum of areas of rectangles.
We also saw how the approximation improves as the width of the rectangles gets smaller. In this
section, we construct these sums for any function f, whether or not it represents a velocity.
Sigma Notation
Suppose f(t) is a continuous function for a ≤t ≤b. We divide the interval from a to b into n equal
subdivisions, and we call the width of an individual subdivision Δt, so
Δt = b −a
n
.
Let t0, t1, t2, ..., tn be endpoints of the subdivisions. Both the left-hand and right-hand sums can
be written more compactly using sigma, or summation, notation. The symbol * is a capital sigma,
or Greek letter “S.” We write
Right-hand sum = f(t1)Δt + f(t2)Δt + · · · + f(tn)Δt =
n
+
i=1
f(ti)Δt.
The * tells us to add terms of the form f(ti)Δt. The “i = 1” at the base of the sigma sign tells us
to start at i = 1, and the “n” at the top tells us to stop at i = n.
In the left-hand sum we start at i = 0 and stop at i = n −1, so we write
Left-hand sum = f(t0)Δt + f(t1)Δt + · · · + f(tn−1)Δt =
n−1
+
i=0
f(ti)Δt.
Taking the Limit to Obtain the Definite Integral
Now we take the limit of these sums as n goes to inﬁnity. If f is continuous for a ≤t ≤b, the
limits of the left- and right-hand sums exist and are equal. The deﬁnite integral is the limit of these
sums. A formal deﬁnition of the deﬁnite integral is given in the online supplement to the text at
www.wiley.com/college/hughes-hallett.

282
Chapter Five KEY CONCEPT: THE DEFINITE INTEGRAL
Suppose f is continuous for a ≤t ≤b. The deﬁnite integral of f from a to b, written
, b
a
f(t) dt,
is the limit of the left-hand or right-hand sums with n subdivisions of a ≤t ≤b as n gets
arbitrarily large. In other words,

.
Each of these sums is called a Riemann sum, f is called the integrand, and a and b are called
the limits of integration.
The “
-
” notation comes from an old-fashioned “S,” which stands for “sum” in the same way
that * does. The “dt” in the integral comes from the factor Δt. Notice that the limits on the *
symbol are 0 and n−1 for the left-hand sum, and 1 and n for the right-hand sum, whereas the limits
on the
-
sign are a and b.
Computing a Definite Integral
In practice, we often approximate deﬁnite integrals numerically using a calculator or computer.
They use programs which compute sums for larger and larger values of n, and eventually give a
value for the integral. Some (but not all) deﬁnite integrals can be computed exactly. However, any
deﬁnite integral can be approximated numerically.
In the next example, we see how numerical approximation works. For each value of n, we
show an over- and an under-estimate for the integral
- 2
1 (1/t) dt. As we increase the value of n, the
over- and under-estimates get closer together, trapping the value of the integral between them. By
increasing the value of n sufﬁciently, we can calculate the integral to any desired accuracy.
Example 1
Calculate the left-hand and right-hand sums with n = 2 for
, 2
1
1
t dt. What is the relation between
the left- and right-hand sums for n = 10 and n = 250 and the integral?
Solution
Here a = 1 and b = 2, so for n = 2, Δt = (2 −1)/2 = 0.5. Therefore, t0 = 1, t1 = 1.5 and
t2 = 2. (See Figure 5.20.) We have
Left-hand sum = f(1)Δt + f(1.5)Δt = 1(0.5) + 1
1.5(0.5) = 0.8333,
Right-hand sum = f(1.5)Δt + f(2)Δt = 1
1.5(0.5) + 1
2(0.5) = 0.5833.
In Figure 5.20 we see that the left-hand sum is bigger than the area under the curve and the right-
hand sum is smaller. So the area under the curve f(t) = 1/t from t = 1 to t = 2 is between
them:
0.5833 <
, 2
1
1
t dt < 0.8333.
Since 1/t is decreasing, when n = 10 in Figure 5.21 we again see that the left-hand sum is larger
than the area under the curve, and the right-hand sum smaller. A calculator or computer gives
0.6688 <

become ﬁner, the left- and right-hand sums get closer together.

The Definite Integral as an Area
If f(x) is positive we can interpret each term f(x0)Δx, f(x1)Δx, . . . in a left- or right-hand Rie-
mann sum as the area of a rectangle. See Figure 5.23. As the width Δx of the rectangles approaches
zero, the rectangles ﬁt the curve of the graph more exactly, and the sum of their areas gets closer
and closer to the area under the curve shaded in Figure 5.24. This suggests that:

When f (x) Is Not Positive
We have assumed in drawing Figure 5.24 that the graph of f(x) lies above the x-axis. If the graph
lies below the x-axis, then each value of f(x) is negative, so each f(x)Δx is negative, and the area
gets counted negatively. In that case, the deﬁnite integral is the negative of the area.
When f (x) is positive for some x values and negative for others, and a < b:

f(x) dx is the sum of areas above the x-axis, counted positively, and areas below the

More General Riemann Sums
Left- and right-hand sums are special cases of Riemann sums. For a general Riemann sum we
allow subdivisions to have different lengths. Also, instead of evaluating f only at the left or right
endpoint of each subdivision, we allow it to be evaluated anywhere in the subdivision. Thus, a
general Riemann sum has the form
n
+
i=1
Value of f(t) at some point in ith subdivision × Length of ith subdivision.
(See Figure 5.28.) As before, we let t0, t1, . . . , tn be the endpoints of the subdivisions, so the length
of the ith subdivision is Δti = ti −ti−1. For each i we choose a point ci in the ith subinterval at
which to evaluate f, leading to the following deﬁnition:
A general Riemann sum for f on the interval [a, b] is a sum of the form
n
+
i=1
f(ci)Δti,
where a =t0 <t1 <· · ·<tn = b, and, for i = 1, . . . , n, Δti = ti −ti−1, and ti−1 ≤ci ≤ti.
If f is continuous, we can make a general Riemann sum as close as we like to the value of
the deﬁnite integral by making the interval lengths small enough. Thus, in approximating deﬁnite
integrals or in proving theorems about them, we can use general Riemann sums rather than left- or
right-hand sums. Generalized Riemann sums are especially useful in establishing properties of the
deﬁnite integral; see www.wiley.com/college/hughes-hallett.

THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM AND INTERPRETATIONS
The Notation and Units for the Definite Integral
Just as the Leibniz notation dy/dx for the derivative reminds us that the derivative is the limit of a
ratio of differences, the notation for the deﬁnite integral helps us recall the meaning of the integral.
The symbol
, b
a
f(x) dx
reminds us that an integral is a limit of sums of terms of the form “f(x) times a small difference
of x.” Ofﬁcially, dx is not a separate entity, but a part of the whole integral symbol. Just as one
thinks of d/dx as a single symbol meaning “the derivative with respect to x of. . . ,” one can think
of
- b
a . . . dx as a single symbol meaning “the integral of . . . with respect to x.”
However, many scientists and mathematicians informally think of dx as an “inﬁnitesimally”
small bit of x multiplied by f(x). This viewpoint is often the key to interpreting the meaning of a
deﬁnite integral. For example, if f(t) is the velocity of a moving particle at time t, then f(t) dt may
by thought of informally as velocity × time, giving the distance traveled by the particle during a
small bit of time dt. The integral
- b
a f(t) dt may then be thought of as the sum of all these small
distances, giving us the net change in position of the particle between t = a and t = b. The notation
for the integral suggests units for the value of the integral. Since the terms being added up are
products of the form “f(x) times a difference in x,” the unit of measurement for
- b
a f(x) dx is
the product of the units for f(x) and the units for x. For example, if f(t) is velocity measured in
meters/second and t is time measured in seconds, then
, b
a
f(t) dt
has units of (meters/sec)×(sec) = meters. This is what we expect, since the value of this integral
represents change in position.

290
Chapter Five KEY CONCEPT: THE DEFINITE INTEGRAL
As another example, graph y = f(x) with the same units of measurement of length along the
x- and y-axes, say cm. Then f(x) and x are measured in the same units, so
, b
a
f(x) dx
is measured in square units of cm × cm = cm2. Again, this is what we would expect since in this
context the integral represents an area.
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
We have seen that change in position can be calculated as the limit of Riemann sums of the velocity
function v = f(t). Thus, change in position is given by the deﬁnite integral
- b
a f(t) dt. If we let
F(t) denote the position function, then the change in position can also be written as F(b) −F(a).
Thus we have:
, b
a
f(t) dt =
Change in position from
t = a to t = b
= F(b) −F(a)
We also know that the position F and velocity f are related using derivatives: F ′(t) = f(t).
Thus, we have uncovered a connection between the integral and derivative, which is so important
it is called the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. It applies to any function F with a continuous
derivative f = F ′.
Theorem 5.1: The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus2
If f is continuous on the interval [a, b] and f(t) = F ′(t), then
, b
a
f(t) dt = F(b) −F(a).
To understand the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, think of f(t) = F ′(t) as the rate of
change of the quantity F(t). To calculate the total change in F(t) between times t = a and t = b,
we divide the interval a ≤t ≤b into n subintervals, each of length Δt. For each small interval, we
estimate the change in F(t), written ΔF, and add these. In each subinterval we assume the rate of
change of F(t) is approximately constant, so that we can say
ΔF ≈Rate of change of F × Time elapsed.
For the ﬁrst subinterval, from t0 to t1, the rate of change of F(t) is approximately F ′(t0), so
ΔF ≈F ′ (t0) Δt.
Similarly, for the second interval
ΔF ≈F ′ (t1) Δt.
Summing over all the subintervals, we get
Total change in F(t)
between t = a and t = b
=
n−1
+
i=0
ΔF ≈
n−1
+
i=0
F ′ (ti) Δt.
We have approximated the change in F(t) as a left-hand sum.
However, the total change in F(t) between the times t = a and t = b is simply F(b) −F(a).
Taking the limit as n goes to inﬁnity converts the Riemann sum to a deﬁnite integral and suggests
the following interpretation of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:3
2This result is sometimes called the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, to distinguish it from the Second Funda-
mental Theorem of Calculus discussed in Section 6.4.
3We could equally well have used a right-hand sum, since the deﬁnite integral is their common limit.

Total change in F(t)
between t = a and t = b
=
, b
a
F ′(t) dt.
In words, the deﬁnite integral of a rate of change gives the total change.
This argument does not, however, constitute a proof of the Fundamental Theorem. The errors
in the various approximations must be investigated using the deﬁnition of limit. A proof is given in
Section 6.4 where we learn how to construct antiderivatives using the Second Fundamental Theorem
of Calculus.
Example 1
If F ′(t) = f(t) and f(t) is velocity in miles/hour, with t in hours, what are the units of - b
a f(t) dt
and F(b) −F(a)?
Solution
Since the units of f(t) are miles/hour and the units of t are hours, the units of
- b
a f(t) dt are
(miles/hour) × hours = miles. Since F measures change in position, the units of F(b) −F(a)
are miles. As expected, the units of
- b
a f(t) dt and F(b) −F(a) are the same.
The Definite Integral of a Rate of Change: Applications of the Fundamental Theorem
Many applications are based on the Fundamental Theorem, which tells us that the deﬁnite integral
of a rate of change gives the total change.
Example 2
Let F(t) represent a bacteria population which is 5 million at time t = 0. After t hours, the popu-
lation is growing at an instantaneous rate of 2t million bacteria per hour. Estimate the total increase
in the bacteria population during the ﬁrst hour, and the population at t = 1.
Solution
Since the rate at which the population is growing is F ′(t) = 2t, we have
Change in population = F(1) −F(0) =

2t dt.
Using a calculator to evaluate the integral,
Change in population =

2t dt = 1.44 million bacteria.
Since F(0) = 5, the population at t = 1 is given by
Population = F(1) = F(0) +

2t dt = 5 + 1.44 = 6.44 million.
The following example shows how representing a quantity as a deﬁnite integral, and thereby as
an area, can be helpful even if we don’t evaluate the integral.

Which is ahead when?
Solution
(a) For the ﬁrst minute car 1 goes faster than car 2, and therefore car 1 must be ahead at the end of
one minute.
(b) At the end of two minutes the situation is less clear, since car 1 was going faster for the ﬁrst
minute and car 2 for the second. However, if v = f(t) is the velocity of a car after t minutes,
then we know that
Distance traveled in two minutes =
, 2
0
f(t) dt,
since the integral of velocity is distance traveled. This deﬁnite integral may also be interpreted
as the area under the graph of f between 0 and 2. Since the area representing the distance
traveled by car 2 is clearly larger than the area for car 1 (see Figure 5.40), we know that car 2
has traveled farther than car 1.
Example 4
Biological activity in water is reﬂected in the rate at which carbon dioxide, CO2, is added or re-
moved. Plants take CO2 out of the water during the day for photosynthesis and put CO2 into the
water at night. Animals put CO2 into the water all the time as they breathe. Figure 5.41 shows the
rate of change of the CO2 level in a pond.4 At dawn, there were 2.600 mmol of CO2 per liter of
water.

5.3 THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM AND INTERPRETATIONS
293
Solution
Let f(t) be the rate at which CO2 is entering the water at time t and let F(t) be the concentration
of CO2 in the water at time t, so F ′(t) = f(t).
(a) From Figure 5.41, we see f(t) is negative for 0 ≤t ≤12, so the CO2 level is decreasing during
this interval (daytime). Since f(t) is positive for 12 < t < 24, the CO2 level is increasing
during this interval (night). The CO2 is lowest at t = 12 (dusk) and highest at t = 0 and t = 24
(dawn).
(b) We want to calculate the total change in the CO2 level in the pond, F(24) −F(12). By the
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,
F(24) −F(12) =
, 24
12
f(t) dt.
We use values of f(t) from the graph (displayed in Table 5.7) to construct a left Riemann sum
approximation to this integral with n = 6, Δt = 2:
, 24
12
f(t) dt ≈f(12) · 2 + f(14) · 2 + f(16) · 2 + · · · + f(22) · 2
≈(0.000)2 + (0.045)2 + (0.035)2 + · · · + (0.012)2 = 0.278.
Thus, between t = 12 and t = 24,
Change in CO2 level = F(24) −F(12) =
, 24
12
f(t) dt ≈0.278 mmol/liter.
(c) To ﬁnd the CO2 level at t = 12, we use the Fundamental Theorem to estimate the change in
CO2 level during the day:
F(12) −F(0) =
, 12
0
f(t) dt
Using a left Riemann sum as in part (b), we have
F(12) −F(0) =
, 12
0
f(t) dt ≈−0.328.
Since initially there were F(0) = 2.600 mmol/liter, we have
F(12) = F(0) −0.328 = 2.272 mmol/liter.
(d) The amount of CO2 removed during the day is represented by the area of the region below the
t-axis; the amount of CO2 added during the night is represented by the area above the t-axis.
These areas look approximately equal, so the CO2 level is approximately in equilibrium.
Using Riemann sums to estimate these areas, we ﬁnd that about 0.278 mmol/l of CO2 was
released into the pond during the night and about 0.328 mmol/l of CO2 was absorbed from the
pond during the day. These quantities are sufﬁciently close that the difference could be due to
measurement error, or to errors from the Riemann sum approximation.

Chapter Five KEY CONCEPT: THE DEFINITE INTEGRAL
Calculating Definite Integrals: Computational Use of the Fundamental Theorem
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus owes its name to its central role in linking rates of change
(derivatives) to total change. However, the Fundamental Theorem also provides an exact way of
computing certain deﬁnite integrals.
Example 5
Compute
, 3
1
2x dx by two different methods.
Solution
Using left- and right-hand sums, we can approximate this integral as accurately as we want. With
n = 100, for example, the left-sum is 7.96 and the right sum is 8.04. Using n = 500 we learn
7.992 <
, 3
1
2x dx < 8.008.
The Fundamental Theorem, on the other hand, allows us to compute the integral exactly. We take
f(x) = 2x. We know that if F(x) = x2, then F ′(x) = 2x. So we use f(x) = 2x and F(x) = x2
and obtain
, 3
1
2x dx = F(3) −F(1) = 32 −12 = 8.
Notice that to use the Fundamental Theorem to calculate a deﬁnite integral, we need to know
the antiderivative, F. Chapter 6 discusses how antiderivatives are computed.

true for all functions for which the integrals make sense.

In words:
1. The integral of the sum (or difference) of two functions is the sum (or difference) of their
integrals.
2. The integral of a constant times a function is that constant times the integral of the func-
tion.
Why Do These Properties Hold?
Both can be visualized by thinking of the deﬁnite integral as the limit of a sum of areas of rectangles.
For property 1, suppose that f and g are positive on the interval [a, b] so that the area under
f(x)+g(x) is approximated by the sum of the areas of rectangles like the one shaded in Figure 5.54.
The area of this rectangle is
(f(xi) + g(xi))Δx = f(xi)Δx + g(xi)Δx.
Since f(xi)Δx is the area of a rectangle under the graph of f, and g(xi)Δx is the area of a rectangle
under the graph of g, the area under f(x) + g(x) is the sum of the areas under f(x) and g(x). For
property 2, notice that multiplying a function by c stretches or shrinks the graph in the vertical
direction by a factor of c. Thus, it stretches or shrinks the height of each approximating rectangle
by c, and hence multiplies the area by c.

Comparing Integrals
Suppose we have constants m and M such that m ≤f(x) ≤M for a ≤x ≤b. We say f is
bounded above by M and bounded below by m. Then the graph of f lies between the horizontal
lines y = m and y = M. So the deﬁnite integral lies between m(b −a) and M(b −a). See
Figure 5.62.
Suppose f(x) ≤g(x) for a ≤x ≤b, as in Figure 5.63. Then the deﬁnite integral of f is less
than or equal to the deﬁnite integral of g. This leads us to the following results:

The Definite Integral as an Average
We know how to ﬁnd the average of n numbers: Add them and divide by n. But how do we ﬁnd the
average value of a continuously varying function? Let us consider an example. Suppose f(t) is the
temperature at time t, measured in hours since midnight, and that we want to calculate the average
temperature over a 24-hour period. One way to start is to average the temperatures at n equally
spaced times, t1, t2, . . . , tn, during the day.
Average temperature ≈f(t1) + f(t2) + · · · + f(tn)
n
.
The larger we make n, the better the approximation. We can rewrite this expression as a Riemann
sum over the interval 0 ≤t ≤24 if we use the fact that Δt = 24/n, so n = 24/Δt:
Average temperature ≈f(t1) + f(t2) + · · · + f(tn)
24/Δt
= f(t1)Δt + f(t2)Δt + · · · + f(tn)Δt
24
= 1
24
n
+
i=1
f(ti)Δt.
As n →∞, the Riemann sum tends toward an integral, and 1/24 of the sum also approximates the
average temperature better. It makes sense, then, to write
Average temperature = lim

How to Visualize the Average on a Graph
The deﬁnition of average value tells us that

f(x) dx.
Let’s interpret the integral as the area under the graph of f. Then the average value of f is the height
of a rectangle whose base is (b −a) and whose area is the same as the area under the graph of f.
(See Figure 5.65.)

the total cost in dollars to heat your house for the ﬁrst 90 days of 2008, namely the months of
January, February, and March. The second expression is measured in (1/days)(dollars) or dollars
per day, the same units as C(t). It represents the average cost per day to heat your house during the
ﬁrst 90 days of 2008.
Example 7
In the year 2000, the population of Nevada was modeled by the function
P = f(t) = 2.020(1.036)t,
where P is in millions of people and t is in years since 2000. Use this function to predict the average
population of Nevada between the years 2000 and 2020.

65. The number of days a cold-blooded organism, such as
an insect, takes to mature depends on the surrounding
temperature, H. Each organism has a minimum temper-
ature Hmin below which no development takes place.13
For an interval of time, Δt, on which the temperature is

measured by the number of degree-days, ΔS, where t is
in days and
ΔS = (H −Hmin)Δt.

1. Medical Case Study: Cardiac Cycle14
Physiologists who study the heart measure and plot quantities that reﬂect many aspects of
cardiac function. One of the most famous plots is the pressure-volume loop, which shows the
blood pressure versus the volume of blood in the left ventricle (LV). Both pressure and volume
change during the cardiac cycle, the periodic relaxation and contraction of the heart, reﬂected
in the lub-dub sounds of a heartbeat.
The LV is a hollow chamber with walls made of muscle. The LV pumps blood from the
heart to all the organs of the body. When the LV contracts, a phase of the cardiac cycle called
systole, the walls move in and blood is expelled from the heart and ﬂows out to the organs.
When the LV relaxes, a phase called diastole, its walls move out and it ﬁlls up with new blood,
ready to be pumped out with the next LV contraction.
The cardiac cycle for the LV can be simpliﬁed into four phases. Points on the pressure-
volume loop in Figure 5.91 represent the pressure and volume at different times during the
cycle, and the arrows show the direction of change. When the LV has just ﬁnished contracting
(so systole ends, and diastole begins), the volume of blood is at a minimum (D1). In Phase 1,
isometric relaxation, the LV relaxes, causing a drop in the LV pressure, while the volume stays
the same, as no new blood can ﬂow into the LV yet. At D2, isometric relaxation ends and Phase
2 begins: the LV starts to ﬁll up with new blood, causing an increase in LV volume and a small
increase in pressure. At S1, diastole ends and the muscular walls of the LV start to contract,
initiating systole. In Phase 3, isometric contraction pressure rises rapidly, but no blood is ejected
yet, so LV volume remains constant. Phase 4 starts at S2, and blood is rapidly expelled from
the LV, so the volume decreases, and there is a mild decrease in pressure. This brings the cycle
back to D1 as systole ends and diastole is ready to begin again.
(a) For each of the four phases of the cardiac cycle, decide whether the work done by the LV
wall on the blood is positive, negative, or zero.
(b) Using the units of pressure and volume, ﬁnd the units of area of regions in the pressure-
volume plane.
(c) Suppose Phases 2 and 4 are the graphs of two functions, g(V ) and f(V ), respectively.
Explain why the integral represents the work done by the LV wall on the blood in each
phase.

3. An Orbiting Satellite
A NASA satellite orbits the earth every 90 minutes. During an orbit, the satellite’s electric power
comes either from solar array wings, when these are illuminated by the sun, or from batteries.
The batteries discharge whenever the satellite uses more electricity than the solar array can
provide or whenever the satellite is in the shadow of the earth (where the solar array cannot be
used). If the batteries are overused, however, they can be damaged.15

You are to determine whether the batteries could be damaged in either of the following op-
erations. You are told that the battery capacity is 50 ampere-hours. If the total battery discharge
does not exceed 40% of battery capacity, the batteries will not be damaged.
(a) Operation 1 is performed by the satellite while orbiting the earth. At the beginning of a
given 90-minute orbit, the satellite performs a 15-minute maneuver which requires more
current than the solar array can deliver, causing the batteries to discharge. The maneuver
causes a sinusoidally varying battery discharge of period 30 minutes with a maximum dis-
charge of ten amperes at 7.5 minutes. For the next 45 minutes the solar array meets the total
satellite current demand, and the batteries do not discharge. During the last 30 minutes, the
satellite is in the shadow of the earth and the batteries supply the total current demand of
30 amperes.
(i) The battery current in amperes is a function of time. Plot the function, showing the
current in amperes as a function of time for the 90-minute orbit. Write a formula (or
formulas) for the battery current function.

Chapter Six CONSTRUCTING ANTIDERIVATIVES
6.1
ANTIDERIVATIVES GRAPHICALLY AND NUMERICALLY
The Family of Antiderivatives
If the derivative of F is f, we call F an antiderivative of f. For example, since the derivative of x2
is 2x, we say that
x2 is an antiderivative of 2x.
Notice that 2x has many antiderivatives, since x2 + 1, x2 + 2, and x2 + 3, all have derivative 2x. In
fact, if C is any constant, we have
d
dx(x2 + C) = 2x + 0 = 2x,
so any function of the form x2 + C is an antiderivative of 2x. The function f(x) = 2x has a family
of antiderivatives.
Let us look at another example. If v is the velocity of a car and s is its position, then v = ds/dt
and s is an antiderivative of v. As before, s+C is an antiderivative of v for any constant C. In terms
of the car, adding C to s is equivalent to adding C to the odometer reading. Adding a constant to
the odometer reading simply means measuring distance from a different point, which does not alter
the car’s velocity.
Visualizing Antiderivatives Using Slopes
Suppose we have the graph of f ′, and we want to sketch an approximate graph of f. We are looking
for the graph of f whose slope at any point is equal to the value of f ′ there. Where f ′ is above
the x-axis, f is increasing; where f ′ is below the x-axis, f is decreasing. If f ′ is increasing, f is
concave up; if f ′ is decreasing, f is concave down.
Example 1
The graph of f ′ is given in Figure 6.1. Sketch a graph of f in the cases when f(0) = 0 and f(0) = 1.

Figure 6.2: Two different f’s which
have the same derivative f ′
Solution
For 0 ≤x ≤2, the function f has a constant slope of 1, so the graph of f is a straight line. For
2 ≤x ≤4, the function f is increasing but more and more slowly; it has a maximum at x = 4 and
decreases thereafter. (See Figure 6.2.) The solutions with f(0) = 0 and f(0) = 1 start at different
points on the vertical axis but have the same shape.
Example 2
Sketch a graph of the antiderivative F of f(x) = e−x2 satisfying F(0) = 0.
Solution
The graph of f(x) = e−x2 is shown in Figure 6.3. The slope of the antiderivative F(x) is given
by f(x). Since f(x) is always positive, the antiderivative F(x) is always increasing. Since f(x) is
increasing for negative x, we know that F(x) is concave up for negative x. Since f(x) is decreasing
for positive x, we know that F(x) is concave down for positive x. Since f(x) →0 as x →±∞,
the graph of F(x) levels off at both ends. See Figure 6.4.

Figure 6.6: Antiderivatives f
Solution
To graph f, start at the point on the vertical axis speciﬁed by the initial condition and move with
slope given by the value of f ′ in Figure 6.5. Different initial conditions lead to different graphs for
f, but for a given x-value they all have the same slope (because the value of f ′ is the same for each).
Thus, the different f curves are obtained from one another by a vertical shift. See Figure 6.6.
• Where f ′ is positive (1 < x < 3), we see f is increasing; where f ′ is negative (0 < x < 1 or
3 < x < 4), we see f is decreasing.
• Where f ′ is increasing (0 < x < 2), we see f is concave up; where f ′ is decreasing
(2 < x < 4), we see f is concave down.
• Where f ′ = 0, we see f has a local maximum at x = 3 and a local minimum at x = 1.
• Where f ′ has a maximum (x = 2), we see f has a point of inﬂection.
Computing Values of an Antiderivative Using Definite Integrals
A graph of f ′ shows where f is increasing and where f is decreasing. We can calculate the actual
value of the function f using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (Theorem 5.1 on page 290): If
f ′ is continuous, then
, b
a
f ′(x) dx = f(b) −f(a).
If we know f(a), we can estimate f(b) by computing the deﬁnite integral using area or Riemann
sums.

Chapter Six CONSTRUCTING ANTIDERIVATIVES
Solution
The critical points of f occur at x = 0, x = 20, and x = 30, where f ′(x) = 0. The inﬂection points
of f occur at x = 10 and x = 25, where f ′(x) has a maximum or minimum. To ﬁnd the coordinates
of the critical points and inﬂection points of f, we evaluate f(x) for x = 0, 10, 20, 25, 30. Using the
Fundamental Theorem, we can express the values of f(x) in terms of deﬁnite integrals. We evaluate
the deﬁnite integrals using the areas of triangular regions under the graph of f ′(x), remembering
that areas below the x-axis are subtracted. (See Figure 6.8.)

6.2
CONSTRUCTING ANTIDERIVATIVES ANALYTICALLY
What Is an Antiderivative of f(x) = 0?
A function whose derivative is zero everywhere on an interval must have a horizontal tangent line at
every point of its graph, and the only way this can happen is if the function is constant. Alternatively,
if we think of the derivative as a velocity, and if the velocity is always zero, then the object is
standing still; the position function is constant. A rigorous proof of this result using the deﬁnition
of the derivative is surprisingly subtle. (See the Constant Function Theorem on page 177.)
If F ′(x) = 0 on an interval, then F(x) = C on this interval, for some constant C.
What Is the Most General Antiderivative of f ?
We know that if a function f has an antiderivative F, then it has a family of antiderivatives of the
form F(x) + C, where C is any constant. You might wonder if there are any others. To decide,
suppose that we have two functions F and G with F ′ = f and G′ = f: that is, F and G are both
antiderivatives of the same function f. Since F ′ = G′ we have (G−F)′ = 0. But this means that we
must have G −F = C, so G(x) = F(x) + C, where C is a constant. Thus, any two antiderivatives
of the same function differ only by a constant.
If F and G are both antiderivatives of f on an interval, then G(x) = F(x) + C.
The Indefinite Integral
All antiderivatives of f(x) are of the form F(x) + C. We introduce a notation for the general an-
tiderivative that looks like the deﬁnite integral without the limits and is called the indeﬁnite integral:
,
f(x) dx = F(x) + C.
It is important to understand the difference between
, b
a
f(x) dx
and
,
f(x) dx.
The ﬁrst is a number and the second is a family of functions. The word “integration” is frequently
used for the process of ﬁnding the antiderivative as well as of ﬁnding the deﬁnite integral. The
context usually makes clear which is intended.

6.2 CONSTRUCTING ANTIDERIVATIVES ANALYTICALLY
327
What Is an Antiderivative of f(x) = k?
If k is a constant, the derivative of kx is k, so we have
An antiderivative of k is kx.
Using the indeﬁnite integral notation, we have
If k is constant,
,
k dx = kx + C.
Finding Antiderivatives
Finding antiderivatives of functions is like taking square roots of numbers: if we pick a number at
random, such as 7 or 493, we may have trouble ﬁnding its square root without a calculator. But if
we happen to pick a number such as 25 or 64, which we know is a perfect square, then we can ﬁnd
its square root exactly. Similarly, if we pick a function which we recognize as a derivative, then we
can ﬁnd its antiderivative easily.
For example, to ﬁnd an antiderivative of f(x) = x, notice that 2x is the derivative of x2; this
tells us that x2 is an antiderivative of 2x. If we divide by 2, then we guess that
An antiderivative of x is x2
2 .
To check this statement, take the derivative of x2/2:
d
dx
x2
2

= 1
2 · d
dx x2 = 1
2 · 2x = x.
What about an antiderivative of x2? The derivative of x3 is 3x2, so the derivative of x3/3 is
3x2/3 = x2. Thus,
An antiderivative of x2 is x3
3 .
The pattern looks like
An antiderivative of xn is xn+1
n + 1.
(We assume n ̸= −1, or we would have x0/0, which does not make sense.) It is easy to check this
formula by differentiation:
d
dx
 xn+1
n + 1

= (n + 1)xn
n + 1
= xn.
In indeﬁnite integral notation, we have shown that
,
xn dx = xn+1
n + 1 + C,
n ̸= −1.

328
Chapter Six CONSTRUCTING ANTIDERIVATIVES
What about when n = −1? In other words, what is an antiderivative of 1/x? Fortunately, we
know a function whose derivative is 1/x, namely, the natural logarithm. Thus, since
d
dx(ln x) = 1
x,
we know that
, 1
x dx = ln x + C,
for x > 0.
If x < 0, then ln x is not deﬁned, so it can’t be an antiderivative of 1/x. In this case, we can try
ln(−x):
d
dx ln(−x) = (−1) 1
−x = 1
x
so
, 1
x dx = ln(−x) + C,
for x < 0.
This means ln x is an antiderivative of 1/x if x > 0, and ln(−x) is an antiderivative of 1/x if x < 0.
Since |x| = x when x > 0 and |x| = −x when x < 0, we can collapse these two formulas into:
An antiderivative of 1
x is ln |x|.
Therefore
, 1
x dx = ln |x| + C.
Since the exponential function is its own derivative, it is also its own antiderivative; thus
,
ex dx = ex + C.
Also, antiderivatives of the sine and cosine are easy to guess. Since
d
dx sin x = cos x
and
d
dx cos x = −sin x,
we get
,
cos x dx = sin x + C
and
,
sin x dx = −cos x + C.
Example 1
Find
,
(3x + x2) dx.
Solution
We know that x2/2 is an antiderivative of x and that x3/3 is an antiderivative of x2, so we expect

In words,
1. An antiderivative of the sum (or difference) of two functions is the sum (or difference)
of their antiderivatives.
2. An antiderivative of a constant times a function is the constant times an antiderivative of
the function.
These properties are analogous to the properties for deﬁnite integrals given on page 300 in
Section 5.4, even though deﬁnite integrals are numbers and antiderivatives are functions.
Example 2
Find
,
(sin x + 3 cos x) dx.
Solution
We break the antiderivative into two terms:
,
(sin x + 3 cos x) dx =

sin x dx + 3

cos x dx = −cosx + 3 sin x + C.
Check by differentiating:

dx(−cos x + 3 sin x + C) = sin x + 3 cosx.
Using Antiderivatives to Compute Definite Integrals
As we saw in Section 5.3, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus gives us a way of calculating
deﬁnite integrals. Denoting F(b) −F(a) by F(x)

continuous, then

To ﬁnd

a f(x) dx, we ﬁrst ﬁnd F, and then calculate F(b) −F(a). This method of computing
deﬁnite integrals gives an exact answer. However, the method only works in situations where we
can ﬁnd the antiderivative F(x). This is not always easy; for example, none of the functions we
have encountered so far is an antiderivative of sin(x2).

DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS AND MOTION
An equation of the form
dy
dx = f(x)
is an example of a differential equation. Finding the general solution to the differential equation
means ﬁnding the general antiderivative y = F(x) + C with F ′(x) = f(x). Chapter 11 gives more
details.
Example 1
Find and graph the general solution of the differential equation
dy
dx = 2x.
Solution
We are asking for a function whose derivative is 2x. One antiderivative of 2x is
y = x2.

How Can We Pick One Solution to the Differential Equation dy
dx = f(x) ?
Picking one antiderivative is equivalent to selecting a value of C. To do this, we need an extra
piece of information, usually that the solution curve passes through a particular point (x0, y0). The
differential equation plus the extra condition
dy
dx = f(x),
y(x0) = y0
is called an initial value problem. (The initial condition y(x0) = y0 is shorthand for y = y0 when
x = x0.) An initial value problem usually has a unique solution, called the particular solution.
Example 2
Find the solution of the initial value problem
dy
dx = 2x,
y(3) = 5.
Solution
We have already seen that the general solution to the differential equation is y = x2 +C. The initial
condition allows us to determine the constant C. Substituting y(3) = 5 gives
5 = y(3) = 32 + C,
so C is given by
C = −4.
Thus, the (unique) solution is
y = x2 −4
Figure 6.24 shows this particular solution, marked C = −4.

Chapter Six CONSTRUCTING ANTIDERIVATIVES
Equations of Motion
We now use differential equations to analyze the motion of an object falling freely under the inﬂu-
ence of gravity. It has been known since Galileo’s time that an object moving under the inﬂuence of
gravity (ignoring air resistance) has constant acceleration, g. In the most frequently used units, its
value is approximately
g = 9.8 m/sec2,
or
g = 32 ft/sec2.
Thus, if v is the upward velocity and t is the time, we have the differential equation
dv
dt = −g.
The negative sign represents the fact that positive velocity is measured upward, whereas gravity acts
downward.
Example 3
A stone is dropped from a 100-foot-high building. Find, as functions of time, its position and veloc-
ity. When does it hit the ground, and how fast is it going at that time?
Solution
Suppose t is measured in seconds from the time when the stone was dropped. If we measure dis-
tance, s, in feet above the ground, then the velocity, v, is in ft/sec upward, and the acceleration due
to gravity is 32 ft/sec2 downward, so we have the differential equation
dv
dt = −32.
From what we know about antiderivatives, the general solution is
v = −32t + C,
where C is some constant. Since v = C when t = 0, the constant C represents the initial velocity,
v0. The fact that the stone is dropped rather than thrown tells us that the initial velocity is zero, so
the initial condition is v0 = 0. Substituting gives
0 = −32(0) + C
so
C = 0.
Thus,
v = −32t.
But now we can write a second differential equation:
v = ds
dt = −32t.
The general solution is
s = −16t2 + K,
where K is another constant.
Since the stone starts at the top of the building, we have the initial condition s = 100 when
t = 0. Substituting gives
100 = −16(02) + K,
so
K = 100,
and therefore
s = −16t2 + 100.
Thus, we have found both v and s as functions of time.

6.3 DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS AND MOTION
335
The stone hits the ground when s = 0, so we must solve
0 = −16t2 + 100
giving t2 = 100/16 or t = ±10/4 = ±2.5 sec. Since t must be positive, t = 2.5 sec. At that time,
v = −32(2.5) = −80 ft/sec. (The velocity is negative because we are considering moving up as
positive and down as negative.) After the stone hits the ground, the differential equation no longer
applies.
Example 4
An object is thrown vertically upward with a speed of 10 m/sec from a height of 2 meters above the
ground. Find the highest point it reaches and the time when it hits the ground.
Solution
We must ﬁnd the position as a function of time. In this example, the velocity is in m/sec, so we use
g = 9.8 m/sec2. Measuring distance in meters upward from the ground, we have the differential
equation
dv
dt = −9.8.
As before, v is a function whose derivative is constant, so
v = −9.8t + C.
Since the initial velocity is 10 m/sec upward, we know that v = 10 when t = 0. Substituting gives
10 = −9.8(0) + C
so
C = 10.
Thus,
v = −9.8t + 10.
To ﬁnd s, we use
v = ds
dt = −9.8t + 10
and look for a function that has −9.8t + 10 as its derivative. The general solution is
s = −4.9t2 + 10t + K,
where K is any constant. To ﬁnd K, we use the fact that the object starts at a height of 2 meters
above the ground, so s = 2 when t = 0. Substituting gives
2 = −4.9(0)2 + 10(0) + K,
so
K = 2,
and therefore
s = −4.9t2 + 10t + 2.
The object reaches its highest point when the velocity is 0, so at that time
v = −9.8t + 10 = 0.
This occurs when
t = 10
9.8 ≈1.02 sec.
When t = 1.02 seconds,
s = −4.9(1.02)2 + 10(1.02) + 2 ≈7.10 meters.
So the maximum height reached is 7.10 meters. The object reaches the ground when s = 0:
0 = −4.9t2 + 10t + 2.
Solving this using the quadratic formula gives
t ≈−0.18 and t ≈2.22 sec.
Since the time at which the object hits the ground must be positive, t ≈2.22 seconds.

Chapter Six CONSTRUCTING ANTIDERIVATIVES
History of the Equations of Motion
The problem of a body moving freely under the inﬂuence of gravity near the surface of the earth
intrigued mathematicians and philosophers from Greek times onward and was ﬁnally solved by
Galileo and Newton. The question to be answered was: How do the velocity and the position of the
body vary with time? We deﬁne s to be the position, or height, of the body above a ﬁxed point (often
ground level), v is the velocity of the body measured upward, and a is the acceleration. The velocity
and position at time t = 0 are represented by v0 and s0 respectively. We assume that the acceleration
of the body is a constant, −g (the negative sign means that the acceleration is downward), so
dv
dt = a = −g.
Problem 35 asks you to show that the motion satisﬁes
v = −gt + v0,
s = −g
2t2 + v0t + s0.
Our derivation of the formulas for the velocity and the position of the body hides an al-
most 2000-year struggle to understand the mechanics of falling bodies, from Aristotle’s Physics
to Galileo’s Dialogues Concerning Two New Sciences.
Though it is an oversimpliﬁcation of his ideas, we can say that Aristotle’s conception of mo-
tion was primarily in terms of change of position. This seems entirely reasonable; it is what we
commonly observe, and this view dominated discussions of motion for centuries. But it misses a
subtlety that was brought to light by Descartes, Galileo, and, with a different emphasis, by Newton.
That subtlety is now usually referred to as the principle of inertia.
This principle holds that a body traveling undisturbed at constant velocity in a straight line
will continue in this motion indeﬁnitely. Stated another way, it says that one cannot distinguish in
any absolute sense (that is, by performing an experiment), between being at rest and moving with
constant velocity in a straight line. If you are reading this book in a closed room and have no external
reference points, there is no experiment that will tell you, one way or the other, whether you are at
rest or whether you, the room, and everything in it are moving with constant velocity in a straight
line. Therefore, as Newton saw, an understanding of motion should be based on change of velocity
rather than change of position. Since acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, it is acceleration
that must play a central role in the description of motion.
Newton placed a new emphasis on the importance of forces. Newton’s laws of motion do not
say what a force is, they say how it acts. His ﬁrst law is the principle of inertia, which says what
happens in the absence of a force—there is no change in velocity. His second law says that a force
acts to produce a change in velocity, that is, an acceleration. It states that F = ma, where m is the
mass of the object, F is the net force, and a is the acceleration produced by this force.
Galileo demonstrated that a body falling under the inﬂuence of gravity does so with constant
acceleration. Assuming we can neglect air resistance, this constant acceleration is independent of
the mass of the body. This last fact was the outcome of Galileo’s famous observation around 1600
that a heavy ball and a light ball dropped off the Leaning Tower of Pisa hit the ground at the same
time. Whether or not he actually performed this experiment, Galileo presented a very clear thought
experiment in the Dialogues to prove the same point. (This point was counter to Aristotle’s more
common-sense notion that the heavier ball would reach the ground ﬁrst.) Galileo showed that the
mass of the object did not appear as a variable in the equation of motion. Thus, the same constant-
acceleration equation applies to all bodies falling under the inﬂuence of gravity.
Nearly a hundred years after Galileo’s experiment, Newton formulated his laws of motion and
gravity, which gave a theoretical explanation of Galileo’s experimental observation that the accel-
eration due to gravity is independent of the mass of the body. According to Newton, acceleration is
caused by force, and in the case of falling bodies, that force is the force of gravity.

6.3 DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS AND MOTION

37. While attempting to understand the motion of bodies un-
der gravity, Galileo stated that:
The time in which any space is traversed by a
body starting at rest and uniformly accelerated
is equal to the time in which that same space
would be traversed by the same body moving
at a uniform speed whose value is the mean of
the highest velocity and the velocity just before
acceleration began.

38. Newton’s law of gravity says that the gravitational force
between two bodies is attractive and given by
F = GMm
r2
,
where G is the gravitational constant, m and M are the
masses of the two bodies, and r is the distance between
them. This is the famous inverse square law. For a falling
body, we take M to be the mass of the earth and r to be
the distance from the body to the center of the earth. So,
actually, r changes as the body falls, but for anything we
can easily observe (say, a ball dropped from the Tower of
Pisa), it won’t change signiﬁcantly over the course of the
motion. Hence, as an approximation, it is reasonable to
assume that the force is constant. According to Newton’s
second law, acceleration is caused by a force and
Force = Mass × Acceleration.
(a) Find the differential equation for the position, s of a
moving body as a function of time.
(b) Explain how the differential equation shows the ac-

another in the same ratio as the odd numbers
beginning with unity.

is the total distance traveled in time t, and g is the accel-
eration due to gravity.

SECOND FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF CALCULUS
Suppose f is an elementary function, that is, a combination of constants, powers of x, sin x, cos x,
ex, and ln x. Then we have to be lucky to ﬁnd an antiderivative F which is also an elementary
function. But if we can’t ﬁnd F as an elementary function, how can we be sure that F exists at all?
In this section we use the deﬁnite integral to construct antiderivatives.
Construction of Antiderivatives Using the Definite Integral
Consider the function f(x) = e−x2. We would like to ﬁnd a way of calculating values of its an-
tiderivative, F, which is not an elementary function. However, assuming F exists, we know from
the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus that
F(b) −F(a) =
, b
a
e−t2 dt.
Setting a = 0 and replacing b by x, we have
F(x) −F(0) =
, x
0
e−t2 dt.
Suppose we want the antiderivative that satisﬁes F(0) = 0. Then we get
F(x) =
, x
0
e−t2 dt.
This is a formula for F. For any value of x, there is a unique value for F(x), so F is a function. For
any ﬁxed x, we can calculate F(x) numerically. For example,
F(2) =
, 2
0
e−t2 dt = 0.88208 . . ..
Notice that our expression for F is not an elementary function; we have created a new function
using the deﬁnite integral. The next theorem says that this method of constructing antiderivatives
works in general. This means that if we deﬁne F by
F(x) =
, x
a
f(t) dt,
then F must be an antiderivative of f.
Theorem 6.2: Construction Theorem for Antiderivatives
(Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus) If f is a continuous function on an interval,
and if a is any number in that interval, then the function F deﬁned on the interval as follows
is an antiderivative of f:
F(x) =
, x
a
f(t) dt.
Proof Our task is to show that F, deﬁned by this integral, is an antiderivative of f. We want to show that
F ′(x) = f(x). By the deﬁnition of the derivative,
F ′(x) = lim
h→0
F(x + h) −F(x)
h
.
To gain some geometric insight, let’s suppose f is positive and h is positive. Then we can visualize
F(x) =
, x
a
f(t) dt
and
F(x + h) =
, x+h
a
f(t) dt

6.4 SECOND FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF CALCULUS

as areas, which leads to representing
F(x + h) −F(x) =
, x+h
x
f(t) dt
as a difference of two areas. From Figure 6.26, we see that F(x + h) −F(x) is roughly the area of
a rectangle of height f(x) and width h (shaded darker in Figure 6.26), so we have
F(x + h) −F(x) ≈f(x)h,
hence
F(x + h) −F(x)
h
≈f(x).
More precisely, we can use Theorem 5.4 on comparing integrals on page 303 to conclude that
mh ≤
, x+h
x
f(t) dt ≤Mh,
where m is the greatest lower bound for f on the interval from x to x + h and M is the least upper
bound on that interval. (See Figure 6.27.) Hence
mh ≤F(x + h) −F(x) ≤Mh,
so
m ≤F(x + h) −F(x)
h
≤M.
Since f is continuous, both m and M approach f(x) as h approaches zero. Thus
f(x) ≤lim
h→0
F(x + h) −F(x)
h
≤f(x).

Thus both inequalities must actually be equalities, so we have the result we want:
f(x) = lim

F(x + h) −F(x)
h
= F ′(x).
Relationship Between the Construction Theorem and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
If F is constructed as in Theorem 6.2, then we have just shown that F ′ = f. Suppose G is any other
antiderivative of f, so G′ = f, and therefore F ′ = G′. Since the derivative of F −G is zero, the
Constant Function Theorem on page 177 tells us that F −G is a constant, so F(x) = G(x) + C.
Since we know F(a) = 0 (by the deﬁnition of F), we can write
, b
a
f(t) dt = F(b) = F(b) −F(a) = (G(b) + C) −(G(a) + C) = G(b) −G(a).

Chapter Six CONSTRUCTING ANTIDERIVATIVES
This result, that the deﬁnite integral
- b
a f(t) dt can be evaluated using any antiderivative of f, is
the (First) Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Thus, we have shown that the First Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus can be obtained from the Construction Theorem (the Second Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus).
Using the Construction Theorem for Antiderivatives
The construction theorem enables us to write down antiderivatives of functions that do not have
elementary antiderivatives. For example, an antiderivative of (sin x)/x is
F(x) =
, x
0
sin t
t
dt.
Notice that F is a function; we can calculate its values to any degree of accuracy.2 This function
already has a name: it is called the sine-integral, and it is denoted Si(x).
Example 1
Construct a table of values of Si(x) for x = 0, 1, 2, 3.
Solution
Using numerical methods, we calculate the values of Si(x) =
- x
0 (sin t)/t dt given in Table 6.2.
Since the integrand is undeﬁned at t = 0, we took the lower limit as 0.00001 instead of 0.

The reason the sine-integral has a name is that some scientists and engineers use it all the
time (for example, in optics). For them, it is just another common function like sine or cosine. Its
derivative is given by

1. Distribution of Resources
Whether a resource is distributed evenly among members of a population is often an im-
portant political or economic question. How can we measure this? How can we decide if the
distribution of wealth in this country is becoming more or less equitable over time? How can
we measure which country has the most equitable income distribution? This problem describes
a way of making such measurements. Suppose the resource is distributed evenly. Then any
20% of the population will have 20% of the resource. Similarly, any 30% will have 30% of
the resource and so on. If, however, the resource is not distributed evenly, the poorest p% of
the population (in terms of this resource) will not have p% of the goods. Suppose F(x) rep-
resents the fraction of the resource owned by the poorest fraction x of the population. Thus
F(0.4) = 0.1 means that the poorest 40% of the population owns 10% of the resource.

3. Slope Fields
Suppose we want to sketch the antiderivative, F, of the function f. To get an accurate graph
of F, we must be careful about making F have the right slope at every point. The slope of F at
any point (x, y) on its graph should be f(x), since F ′(x) = f(x). We arrange this as follows:
at the point (x, y) in the plane, draw a small line segment with slope f(x). Do this at many
points. We call such a diagram a slope ﬁeld. If f(x) = x, we get the slope ﬁeld in Figure 6.45.
x
Figure 6.45: Slope ﬁeld of
f(x) = x
x
Figure 6.46: Slope ﬁeld of
f(x) = e−x2
Notice how the lines in Figure 6.45 seem to be arranged in a parabolic pattern. This is
because the general antiderivative of x is x2/2 + C, so the lines are all the tangent lines to the
family of parabolas y = x2/2 + C. This suggests a way of ﬁnding antiderivatives graphically
even if we can’t write down a formula for them: plot the slopes, and see if they suggest the
graph of an antiderivative. For example, if you do this with f(x) = e−x2, which is one of the
functions that does not have an elementary antiderivative, you get Figure 6.46.
You can see the ghost of the graph of a function lurking behind the slopes in Figure 6.46;
in fact there is a whole stack of them. If you move across the plane in the direction suggested by
the slope ﬁeld at every point, you will trace out a curve. The slope ﬁeld is tangent to the curve
everywhere, so this is the graph of an antiderivative of e−x2.

Chapter Seven INTEGRATION
7.1
INTEGRATION BY SUBSTITUTION
In Chapter 3, we learned rules to differentiate any function obtained by combining constants, powers
of x, sin x, cos x, ex, and ln x, using addition, multiplication, division, or composition of functions.
Such functions are called elementary.
In this chapter, we introduce several methods of antidifferentiation. However, there is a great
difference between looking for derivatives and looking for antiderivatives. Every elementary func-
tion has elementary derivatives, but most elementary functions—such as
√
x3 + 1, (sin x)/x, and
e−x2—do not have elementary antiderivatives.
All commonly occurring antiderivatives can be found with a computer algebra system (CAS).
However, just as it is useful to be able to calculate 3 + 4 without a calculator, we usually calculate
some antiderivatives by hand.
The Guess-and-Check Method
A good strategy for ﬁnding simple antiderivatives is to guess an answer (using knowledge of differ-
entiation rules) and then check the answer by differentiating it. If we get the expected result, then
we’re done; otherwise, we revise the guess and check again.
The method of guess-and-check is useful in reversing the chain rule. According to the chain
rule,
d
dx(f(g(x))) = f ′
	
Derivative of outside↗
(
Inside
	
g(x)) · g′(x)
  	
↖Derivative of inside
.
Thus, any function which is the result of applying the chain rule is the product of two factors:
the “derivative of the outside” and the “derivative of the inside.” If a function has this form, its
antiderivative is f(g(x)).
Example 1
Find
,
3x2 cos(x3) dx.
Solution
The function 3x2 cos(x3) looks like the result of applying the chain rule: there is an “inside” func-
tion x3 and its derivative 3x2 appears as a factor. Since the outside function is a cosine which has a
sine as an antiderivative, we guess sin(x3) for the antiderivative. Differentiating to check gives
d
dx(sin(x3)) = cos(x3) · (3x2).
Since this is what we began with, we know that
,
3x2 cos(x3) dx = sin(x3) + C.
The basic idea of this method is to try to ﬁnd an inside function whose derivative appears as a
factor. This works even when the derivative is missing a constant factor, as in the next example.
Example 2
Find
,
x3
x4 + 5 dx.
Solution
Here the inside function is x4 + 5, and its derivative appears as a factor, with the exception of a
missing 4. Thus, the integrand we have is more or less of the form
g′(x)

g(x),
with g(x) = x4 + 5. Since x3/2/(3/2) is an antiderivative of the outside function √x, we might
guess that an antiderivative is
(g(x))3/2
3/2
= (x4 + 5)3/2

2(x4 + 5)1/2 · 4x3 = x3(x4 + 5)1/2.
As we see in the preceding example, antidifferentiating a function often involves “correcting
for” constant factors: if differentiation produces an extra factor of 2, antidifferentiation will require
a factor of 1
2.
The Method of Substitution
When the integrand is complicated, it helps to formalize this guess-and-check method as follows:
To Make a Substitution
Let w be the “inside function” and dw = w′(x) dx = dw
dx dx.
Let’s redo the ﬁrst example using a substitution.
Example 3
Find
,
3x2 cos(x3) dx.
Solution
As before, we look for an inside function whose derivative appears—in this case x3. We let w = x3.
Then dw = w′(x) dx = 3x2 dx. The original integrand can now be completely rewritten in terms of
the new variable w:
,
3x2 cos(x3) dx =
,
cos (x3)
	
w
· 3x2 dx
  	
dw
=
,
cos w dw = sin w + C = sin(x3) + C.
By changing the variable to w, we can simplify the integrand. We now have cos w, which can
be antidifferentiated more easily. The ﬁnal step, after antidifferentiating, is to convert back to the
original variable, x.
Why Does Substitution Work?
The substitution method makes it look as if we can treat dw and dx as separate entities, even cancel-
ing them in the equation dw = (dw/dx)dx. Let’s see why this works. Suppose we have an integral
of the form
-
f(g(x))g′(x) dx, where g(x) is the inside function and f(x) is the outside function.
If F is an antiderivative of f, then F ′ = f, and by the chain rule
d
dx(F(g(x))) = f(g(x))g′(x).
Therefore,
,
f(g(x))g′(x) dx = F(g(x)) + C.

356
Chapter Seven INTEGRATION
Now write w = g(x) and dw/dx = g′(x) on both sides of this equation:
,
f(w)dw
dx dx = F(w) + C.
On the other hand, knowing that F ′ = f tells us that
,
f(w) dw = F(w) + C.
Thus, the following two integrals are equal:
,
f(w)dw
dx dx =
,
f(w) dw.
Substituting w for the inside function and writing dw = w′(x)dx leaves the indeﬁnite integral
unchanged.
Let’s revisit the second example that we did by guess-and-check.
Example 4
Find
,
x3
x4 + 5 dx.
Solution
The inside function is x4 + 5, with derivative 4x3. The integrand has a factor of x3, and since the
only thing missing is a constant factor, we try
w = x4 + 5.
Then
dw = w′(x) dx = 4x3 dx,
giving
1
4dw = x3 dx.
Thus,
,
x3
x4 + 5 dx =
, √w 1
4dw = 1
4
,
w1/2 dw = 1
4 · w3/2
3/2 + C = 1
6(x4 + 5)3/2 + C.
Once again, we get the same result as with guess-and-check.
Warning
We saw in the preceding example that we can apply the substitution method when a constant
factor is missing from the derivative of the inside function. However, we may not be able
to use substitution if anything other than a constant factor is missing. For example, setting
w = x4 + 5 to ﬁnd
,
x2
x4 + 5 dx
does us no good because x2 dx is not a constant multiple of dw = 4x3 dx. Substitution works
if the integrand contains the derivative of the inside function, to within a constant factor.
Some people prefer the substitution method over guess-and-check since it is more systematic,
but both methods achieve the same result. For simple problems, guess-and-check can be faster.
Example 5
Find
,
ecos θ sin θ dθ.
Solution
We let w = cos θ since its derivative is −sin θ and there is a factor of sin θ in the integrand. This
gives
dw = w′(θ) dθ = −sin θ dθ,

7.1 INTEGRATION BY SUBSTITUTION
357
so
−dw = sin θ dθ.
Thus
,
ecos θ sin θ dθ =
,
ew (−dw) = (−1)
,
ew dw = −ew + C = −ecos θ + C.
Example 6
Find
,
et
1 + et dt.
Solution
Observing that the derivative of 1 + et is et, we see w = 1 + et is a good choice. Then dw = et dt,
so that
,
et
1 + et dt =
,
1
1 + et et dt =
,
1
w dw = ln |w| + C
= ln |1 + et| + C
= ln(1 + et) + C.
(Since (1 + et) is always positive.)
Since the numerator is et dt, we might also have tried w = et. This substitution leads to the integral
-
(1/(1 + w))dw, which is better than the original integral but requires another substitution, u =
1 + w, to ﬁnish. There are often several different ways of doing an integral by substitution.
Notice the pattern in the previous example: having a function in the denominator and its deriva-
tive in the numerator leads to a natural logarithm. The next example follows the same pattern.
Example 7

Recall that tan θ = (sin θ)/(cos θ). If w = cos θ, then dw = −sin θ dθ, so

One way to think of integration is in terms of standard forms, whose antiderivatives are known.
Substitution is useful for putting a complicated integral in a standard form.
Example 8
Give a substitution w and constants k, n so that the following integral has the form
-
kwn dw:
,
ex cos3(ex) sin(ex) dx.
Solution
We notice that one of the factors in the integrand is (cos(ex))3, so if we let w = cos(ex), this factor
is w3. Then dw = (−sin(ex))ex dx, so
,
ex cos3(ex) sin(ex) dx =
,
cos3(ex)(sin(ex))ex dx =
,
w3 (−dw).
Therefore, we choose w = cos(ex) and then k = −1, n = 3.

Definite Integrals by Substitution
Example 9
Compute
, 2

xex2 dx.
Solution
To evaluate this deﬁnite integral using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we ﬁrst need to ﬁnd
an antiderivative of f(x) = xex2. The inside function is x2, so we let w = x2. Then dw = 2x dx,
so 1
2 dw = x dx. Thus,
,
xex2 dx =

ew 1
2 dw = 1
2ew + C = 1

There is another way to look at the same problem. After we established that
,
xex2 dx = 1
2ew + C,
our next two steps were to replace w by x2, and then x by 2 and 0. We could have directly replaced
the original limits of integration, x = 0 and x = 2, by the corresponding w limits. Since w = x2,
the w limits are w = 02 = 0 (when x = 0) and w = 22 = 4 (when x = 2), so we get

xex2 dx = 1

To Use Substitution to Find Deﬁnite Integrals
Either
• Compute the indeﬁnite integral, expressing an antiderivative in terms of the original vari-
able, and then evaluate the result at the original limits,
or
• Convert the original limits to new limits in terms of the new variable and do not convert
the antiderivative back to the original variable.
Example 10
Evaluate
, π/4
0
tan3 θ
cos2 θ dθ.
Solution
To use substitution, we must decide what w should be. There are two possible inside functions,
tan θ and cos θ. Now
d
dθ(tan θ) =
1
cos2 θ
and
d
dθ(cos θ) = −sin θ,
and since the integral contains a factor of 1/ cos2 θ but not of sin θ, we try w = tan θ. Then
dw = (1/ cos2 θ)dθ. When θ = 0, w = tan 0 = 0, and when θ = π/4, w = tan(π/4) = 1,
so

Notice that we write the limit w = 4 at the bottom, even though it is larger than w = 2, because
w = 4 corresponds to the lower limit x = 1.
More Complex Substitutions
In the examples of substitution presented so far, we guessed an expression for w and hoped to ﬁnd
dw (or some constant multiple of it) in the integrand. What if we are not so lucky? It turns out that it
often works to let w be some messy expression contained inside, say, a cosine or under a root, even
if we cannot see immediately how such a substitution helps.
Example 12
Find
, !
1 + √x dx.
Solution
This time, the derivative of the inside function is nowhere to be seen. Nevertheless, we try w = 1 + √x.
Then w −1 = √x, so (w −1)2 = x. Therefore 2(w −1) dw = dx. We have
, !
1 + √x dx =
, √w 2(w −1) dw = 2

Notice that the substitution in the preceding example again converts the inside of the messiest
function into something simple. In addition, since the derivative of the inside function is not waiting
for us, we have to solve for x so that we can get dx entirely in terms of w and dw.
Example 13
Find
,
(x + 7)
3√
3 −2x dx.
Solution
Here, instead of the derivative of the inside function (which is −2), we have the factor (x + 7).
However, substituting w = 3−2x turns out to help anyway. Then dw = −2 dx, so (−1/2) dw = dx.
Now we must convert everything to w, including x + 7. If w = 3 −2x, then 2x = 3 −w, so
x = 3/2 −w/2, and therefore we can write x + 7 in terms of w. Thus
,

Looking back over the solution, the reason this substitution works is that it converts
3√3 −2x,
the messiest part of the integrand, to
3√w, which can be combined with the other factor and then
integrated.

7.2
INTEGRATION BY PARTS
The method of substitution reverses the chain rule. Now we introduce integration by parts, which is
based on the product rule.
Example 1
Find
,
xex dx.
Solution
We are looking for a function whose derivative is xex. The product rule might lead us to guess xex,
because we know that the derivative has two terms, one of which is xex:
d
dx(xex) = d
dx(x)ex + x d
dx(ex) = ex + xex.
Of course, our guess is wrong because of the extra ex. But we can adjust our guess by subtracting
ex; this leads us to try xex −ex. Let’s check it:
d
dx(xex −ex) = d
dx(xex) −d
dx(ex) = ex + xex −ex = xex.
It works, so
,
xex dx = xex −ex + C.
Example 2
Find
,
θ cos θ dθ.
Solution
We guess the antiderivative is θ sin θ and use the product rule to check:
d
dθ(θ sin θ) = d(θ)
dθ sin θ + θ d
dθ (sin θ) = sin θ + θ cos θ.
To correct for the extra sin θ term, we must subtract from our original guess something whose
derivative is sin θ. Since
d
dθ(cos θ) = −sin θ, we try:
d
dθ (θ sin θ + cos θ) = d
dθ(θ sin θ) + d
dθ (cos θ) = sin θ + θ cos θ −sin θ = θ cos θ.
Thus,
,
θ cos θ dθ = θ sin θ + cos θ + C.
The General Formula for Integration by Parts
We can formalize the process illustrated in the last two examples in the following way. We begin
with the product rule:
d
dx(uv) = u′v + uv′

7.2 INTEGRATION BY PARTS
365
where u and v are functions of x with derivatives u′ and v′, respectively. We rewrite this as:
uv′ = d
dx(uv) −u′v
and then integrate both sides:
,
uv′ dx =
,
d
dx(uv) dx −
,
u′v dx.
Since an antiderivative of d
dx(uv) is just uv, we get the following formula:
Integration by Parts
,
uv′ dx = uv −
,
u′v dx.
This formula is useful when the integrand can be viewed as a product and when the integral on
the right-hand side is simpler than that on the left. In effect, we were using integration by parts in
the previous two examples. In Example 1, we let xex = (x) · (ex) = uv′, and choose u = x and
v′ = ex. Thus, u′ = 1 and v = ex, so
,

(ex)

v

	
u′
(ex)
	
v
dx = xex −ex + C.
So uv represents our ﬁrst guess, and
-
u′v dx represents the correction to our guess.
Notice what would have happened if, instead of v = ex, we took v = ex + C1. Then
,
xex dx = x(ex + C1) −
,
(ex + C1) dx
= xex + C1x −ex −C1x + C
= xex −ex + C,
as before. Thus, it is not necessary to include an arbitrary constant in the antiderivative for v; any
antiderivative will do.
What would have happened if we had picked u and v′ the other way around? If u = ex and
v′ = x, then u′ = ex and v = x2/2. The formula for integration by parts then gives
,
xex dx = x2
2 ex −
, x2
2 · ex dx,
which is true but not helpful since the integral on the right is worse than the one on the left. To use
this method, we must choose u and v′ to make the integral on the right easier to ﬁnd than the integral
on the left.
How to Choose u and v′
• Whatever you let v′ be, you need to be able to ﬁnd v.
• It helps if u′ is simpler than u (or at least no more complicated than u).
• It helps if v is simpler than v′ (or at least no more complicated than v′).
If we pick v′ = x in Example 1, then v = x2/2, which is certainly “worse” than v′.
There are some examples which don’t look like good candidates for integration by parts because
they don’t appear to involve products, but for which the method works well. Such examples often
involve ln x or the inverse trigonometric functions. Here is one:

Chapter Seven INTEGRATION
Example 3
Find
, 3
2
ln x dx.
Solution
This does not look like a product unless we write ln x = (1)(ln x). Then we might say u = 1 so
u′ = 0, which certainly makes things simpler. But if v′ = ln x, what is v? If we knew, we would
not need integration by parts. Let’s try the other way: if u = ln x, u′ = 1/x and if v′ = 1, v = x, so

Notice that when doing a deﬁnite integral by parts, we must remember to put the limits of
integration (here 2 and 3) on the uv term (in this case x ln x) as well as on the integral
-
u′v dx.
Example 4
Find
,
x6 ln x dx.
Solution
View x6 ln x as uv′ where u = ln x and v′ = x6. Then v = 1
7x7 and u′ = 1/x, so integration by
parts gives us:
,
x6 ln x dx =

In Example 4 we did not choose v′ = ln x, because it is not immediately clear what v would
be. In fact, we used integration by parts in Example 3 to ﬁnd the antiderivative of ln x. Also, using
u = ln x, as we have done, gives u′ = 1/x, which can be considered simpler than u = ln x. This
shows that u does not have to be the ﬁrst factor in the integrand (here x6).
Example 5
Find
,
x2 sin 4x dx.
Solution
If we let v′ = sin 4x, then v = −1
4 cos 4x, which is no worse than v′. Also letting u = x2, we get
u′ = 2x, which is simpler than u = x2. Using integration by parts:

Notice that, in this example, each time we used integration by parts, the exponent of x went down
by 1. In addition, when the arbitrary constant C is multiplied by 1
2, it is still represented by C.
Example 6
Find
,
cos2 θ dθ.
Solution
Using integration by parts with u = cos θ, v′ = cos θ gives u′ = −sin θ, v = sin θ, so we get
,
cos2 θ dθ = cos θ sin θ +
,
sin2 θ dθ.
Substituting sin2 θ = 1 −cos2 θ leads to
,
cos2 θ dθ = cos θ sin θ +
,
(1 −cos2 θ) dθ
= cos θ sin θ +
,
1 dθ −
,
cos2 θ dθ.
Looking at the right side, we see that the original integral has reappeared. If we move it to the left,
we get
2
,
cos2 θ dθ = cos θ sin θ +
,
1 dθ = cos θ sin θ + θ + C.
Dividing by 2 gives
,
cos2 θ dθ = 1
2 cos θ sin θ + 1
2θ + C.
Problem 53 asks you to do this integral by another method.
The previous example illustrates a useful technique: Use integration by parts to transform the
integral into an expression containing another copy of the same integral, possibly multiplied by a
coefﬁcient, then solve for the original integral.
Example 7
Use integration by parts twice to ﬁnd
,
e2x sin(3x) dx.
Solution
Using integration by parts with u = e2x and v′ = sin(3x) gives u′ = 2e2x, v = −1

get

e2x sin(3x) dx = −1

On the right side we have an integral similar to the original one, with the sine replaced by a cosine.
Using integration by parts on that integral in the same way gives
,
e2x cos(3x) dx = 1

3
,
e2x sin(3x) dx.
Substituting this into the expression we obtained for the original integral gives

e2x sin(3x) dx = −1

TABLES OF INTEGRALS
Today, many integrals are done using a CAS. Traditionally, the antiderivatives of commonly used
functions were compiled in a table, such as the one in the back of this book. Other tables include
CRC Standard Mathematical Tables (Boca Raton, Fl: CRC Press). The key to using these tables
is being able to recognize the general class of function that you are trying to integrate, so you can
know in what section of the table to look.
Warning: This section involves long division of polynomials and completing the square. You may
want to review these topics!
Using the Table of Integrals
Part I of the table inside the back cover gives the antiderivatives of the basic functions xn, ax,
ln x, sin x, cos x, and tan x. (The antiderivative for ln x is found using integration by parts and is a
special case of the more general formula III-13.) Most of these are already familiar.
Part II of the table contains antiderivatives of functions involving products of ex, sin x, and
cos x. All of these antiderivatives were obtained using integration by parts.
Example 1
Find
,
sin 7z sin 3z dz.
Solution
Since the integrand is the product of two sines, we should use II-10 in the table,
,
sin 7z sin 3z dz = −1
40(7 cos7z sin 3z −3 cos3z sin 7z) + C.
Part III of the table contains antiderivatives for products of a polynomial and ex, sin x, or
cos x. It also has an antiderivative for xn ln x, which can easily be used to ﬁnd the antiderivatives of
the product of a general polynomial and ln x. Each reduction formula is used repeatedly to reduce
the degree of the polynomial until a zero-degree polynomial is obtained.
Example 2
Find
,
(x5 + 2x3 −8)e3x dx.
Solution
Since p(x) = x5 + 2x3 −8 is a polynomial multiplied by e3x, this is of the form in III-14. Now
p′(x) = 5x4 + 6x2 and p′′(x) = 20x3 + 12x, and so on, giving
,
(x5 + 2x3 −8)e3x dx = e3x

+ C.
Here we have the successive derivatives of the original polynomial x5 + 2x3 −8, occurring with
alternating signs and multiplied by successive powers of 1/3.
Part IV of the table contains reduction formulas for the antiderivatives of cosn x and sinn x,
which can be obtained by integration by parts. When n is a positive integer, formulas IV-17 and
IV-18 can be used repeatedly to reduce the power n until it is 0 or 1.

6 sin5 θ cos θ + 5

,
sin6 θ dθ = −1
6 sin5 θ cos θ −5
24 sin3 θ cos θ −15
48 sin θ cos θ + 15
48θ + C.
The last item in Part IV of the table is not a formula: it is advice on how to antidifferenti-
ate products of integer powers of sin x and cos x. There are various techniques to choose from,
depending on the nature (odd or even, positive or negative) of the exponents.
Example 4
Find
,
cos3 t sin4 t dt.
Solution
Here the exponent of cos t is odd, so IV-23 recommends making the substitution w = sin t. Then
dw = cos t dt. To make this work, we’ll have to separate off one of the cosines to be part of
dw. Also, the remaining even power of cos t can be rewritten in terms of sin t by using cos2 t =
1 −sin2 t = 1 −w2, so that
,
cos3 t sin4 t dt =
,
cos2 t sin4 t cost dt
=
,
(1 −w2)w4 dw =
,
(w4 −w6) dw
= 1
5w5 −1
7w7 + C = 1
5 sin5 t −1
7 sin7 t + C.
Example 5
Find
,
cos2 x sin4 x dx.
Solution
In this example, both exponents are even. The advice given in IV-23 is to convert to all sines or all
cosines. We’ll convert to all sines by substituting cos2 x = 1 −sin2 x, and then we’ll multiply out
the integrand:
,
cos2 x sin4 x dx =
,
(1 −sin2 x) sin4 x dx =
,
sin4 x dx −
,
sin6 x dx.
In Example 3 we found
-
sin4 x dx and

sin6 x dx. Put them together to get

7.3 TABLES OF INTEGRALS
373
The last two parts of the table are concerned with quadratic functions: Part V has expressions
with quadratic denominators; Part VI contains square roots of quadratics. The quadratics that ap-
pear in these formulas are of the form x2 ±a2 or a2−x2, or in factored form (x−a)(x−b), where a
and b are different constants. Quadratics can be converted to these forms by factoring or completing
the square.
Preparing to Use the Table: Transforming the Integrand
To use the integral table, we often need to manipulate or reshape integrands to ﬁt entries in the
table. The manipulations that tend to be useful are factoring, long division, completing the square,
and substitution.
Using Factoring
Example 6
Find
,
3x + 7
x2 + 6x + 8 dx.
Solution
In this case we factor the denominator to get it into a form in the table:
x2 + 6x + 8 = (x + 2)(x + 4).
Now in V-27 we let a = −2, b = −4, c = 3, and d = 7, to obtain
,
3x + 7
x2 + 6x + 8 dx = 1
2(ln |x + 2| −(−5) ln |x + 4|) + C.
Long Division
Example 7
Find
,
x2
x2 + 4 dx.
Solution
A good rule of thumb when integrating a rational function whose numerator has a degree greater
than or equal to that of the denominatoris to start by doing long division. This results in a polynomial
plus a simpler rational function as a remainder. Performing long division here, we obtain:
x2
x2 + 4 = 1 −
4
x2 + 4.
Then, by V-24 with a = 2, we obtain:
,
x2
x2 + 4 dx =
,
1 dx −4
,
1
x2 + 4 dx = x −4 · 1
2 arctan x
2 + C.
Completing the Square to Rewrite the Quadratic in the Form w2 + a2
Example 8
Find
,
1
x2 + 6x + 14 dx.
Solution
By completing the square, we can get this integrand into a form in the table:
x2 + 6x + 14 = (x2 + 6x + 9) −9 + 14
= (x + 3)2 + 5.
Let w = x + 3. Then dw = dx and so the substitution gives
,

x2 + 6x + 14 dx =

where the antidifferentiation uses V-24 with a2 = 5.

Chapter Seven INTEGRATION
Substitution
Getting an integrand into the right form to use a table of integrals involves substitution and a variety
of algebraic techniques.
Example 9
Find
,
et sin(5t + 7) dt.
Solution
This looks similar to II-8. To make the correspondence more complete, let’s try the substitution
w = 5t + 7. Then dw = 5 dt, so dt = 1
5 dw. Also, t = (w −7)/5. Then the integral becomes
,
et sin(5t + 7) dt =
,
e(w−7)/5 sin w dw
5
= e−7/5
5
,
ew/5 sin w dw.
(Since e(w−7)/5 = ew/5e−7/5 and e−7/5 is a constant)
Now we can use II-8 with a = 1
5 and b = 1 to write
,
ew/5 sin w dw =

( 1

Example 10
Find a substitution w and constants k, n so that the following integral has the form - kwn ln w dw,
found in III-15:
, ln(x + 1) + ln(x −1)
√
x2 −1
x dx
Solution
First we use properties of ln to simplify the integral:
, ln(x + 1) + ln(x −1)
√
x2 −1
x dx =
, ln((x + 1)(x −1))
√
x2 −1
x dx =
, ln(x2 −1)
√
x2 −1 x dx.
Let w = x2 −1, dw = 2x dx, so that x dx = (1/2) dw. Then
, ln(x2 −1)
√
x2 −1 x dx =
,
w−1/2 ln w 1
2dw =
, 1
2w−1/2 ln w dw,
so k = 1/2, n = −1/2.

ALGEBRAIC IDENTITIES AND TRIGONOMETRIC SUBSTITUTIONS
Although not all functions have elementary antiderivatives, many do. In this section we introduce
two powerful methods of integration which show that large classes of functions have elementary an-
tiderivatives. The ﬁrst is the method of partial fractions, which depends on an algebraic identity, and
allows us to integrate rational functions. The second is the method of trigonometric substitutions,
which allows us to handle expressions involving the square root of a quadratic polynomial. Some of
the formulas in the table of integrals can be derived using the techniques of this section.
Method of Partial Fractions
The integral of some rational functions can be obtained by splitting the integrand into partial frac-
tions. For example, to ﬁnd
,
1
(x −2)(x −5) dx,

7.4 ALGEBRAIC IDENTITIES AND TRIGONOMETRIC SUBSTITUTIONS
377
the integrand is split into partial fractions with denominators (x −2) and (x −5). We write
1
(x −2)(x −5) =
A
x −2 +
B
x −5,
where A and B are constants that need to be found. Multiplying by (x−2)(x−5) gives the identity
1 = A(x −5) + B(x −2)
so
1 = (A + B)x −5A −2B.
Since this equation holds for all x, the constant terms on both sides must be equal.6 Similarly, the
coefﬁcients of x on both sides must be equal. So
−5A −2B = 1
A + B = 0.
Solving these equations gives A = −1/3, B = 1/3. Thus,
1
(x −2)(x −5) = −1/3
x −2 + 1/3
x −5.
(Check the answer by writing the right-hand side over the common denominator (x −2)(x −5).)
Example 1
Use partial fractions to integrate
,
1
(x −2)(x −5) dx.
Solution
We split the integrand into partial fractions, each of which can be integrated:
,
1
(x −2)(x −5) dx =
, −1/3
x −2 + 1/3
x −5

dx = −1
3 ln |x −2| + 1
3 ln |x −5| + C.
You can check that using formula V-26 in the integral table gives the same result.
This method can be used to derive formulas V-26 and V-27 in the integral table. A similar
method works whenever the denominator of the integrand factors into distinct linear factors and the
numerator has degree less than the denominator.
Example 2
Find
,
x + 2
x2 + x dx.
Solution
We factor the denominator and split the integrand into partial fractions:
x + 2
x2 + x =
x + 2
x(x + 1) = A
x +
B
x + 1.
Multiplying by x(x + 1) gives the identity
x + 2 = A(x + 1) + Bx
= (A + B)x + A.
Equating constant terms and coefﬁcients of x gives A = 2 and A + B = 1, so B = −1. Then we
split the integrand into two parts and integrate:
,
x + 2
x2 + x dx =
,  2
x −
1
x + 1

dx = 2 ln |x| −ln |x + 1| + C.
The next example illustrates what to do if there is a repeated factor in the denominator.

6We have not shown that the equation holds for x = 2 and x = 5, but these values do not affect the argument.

378
Chapter Seven INTEGRATION
Solution
We are given that the squared factor, (x −1)2, leads to partial fractions of the form:
10x −2x2
(x −1)2(x + 3) =
A
x −1 +
B
(x −1)2 +
C
x + 3.
Multiplying through by (x −1)2(x + 3) gives
10x −2x2 = A(x −1)(x + 3) + B(x + 3) + C(x −1)2
= (A + C)x2 + (2A + B −2C)x −3A + 3B + C.
Equating the coefﬁcients of x2 and x and the constant terms, we get the simultaneous equations:
A + C = −2
2A + B −2C = 10
−3A + 3B + C = 0.
Solving gives A = 1, B = 2, C = −3. Thus, we obtain three integrals which can be evaluated:
,
10x −2x2
(x −1)2(x + 3) dx =
, 

x −1 +
2
(x −1)2 −
3


dx
= ln |x −1| −
2
(x −1) −3 ln |x + 3| + K.
For the second integral, we use the fact that
-
2/(x−1)2dx = 2
-
(x−1)−2dx = −2(x−1)−1+K.
If there is a quadratic in the denominator which cannot be factored, we need an expression of
the form Ax + B in the numerator, as the next example shows.
Example 4
Find
,
2x2 −x −1
(x2 + 1)(x −2) dx using partial fractions of the form Ax + B
x2 + 1 and
C
x −2.
Solution
We are given that the quadratic denominator, (x2 + 1), which cannot be factored further, has a
numerator of the form Ax + B, so we have
2x2 −x −1
(x2 + 1)(x −2) = Ax + B
x2 + 1 +
C
x −2.
Multiplying by (x2 + 1)(x −2) gives
2x2 −x −1 = (Ax + B)(x −2) + C(x2 + 1)
= (A + C)x2 + (B −2A)x + C −2B.
Equating the coefﬁcients of x2 and x and the constant terms gives the simultaneous equations
A + C = 2
B −2A = −1
C −2B = −1.
Solving gives A = B = C = 1, so we rewrite the integral as follows:
,
2x2 −x −1
(x2 + 1)(x −2) dx =

x2 + 1 +

This identity is useful provided we can perform the integration on the right-hand side. The ﬁrst
integral can be done if it is split into two; the second integral is similar to those in the previous
examples. We have

The next example shows what to do if the numerator has degree larger than the denominator.
Example 5
Calculate
, x3 −7x2 + 10x + 1
x2 −7x + 10
dx using long division before integrating.
Solution
The degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, so we divide ﬁrst:
x3 −7x2 + 10x + 1
x2 −7x + 10
= x(x2 −7x + 10) + 1
x2 −7x + 10
= x +
1
x2 −7x + 10.
The remainder, in this case 1/(x2 −7x + 10), is a rational function on which we try to use partial
fractions. We have
1
x2 −7x + 10 =
1
(x −2)(x −5)

• If degree of P(x) ≥degree of Q(x), try long division and the method of partial fractions
on the remainder.
• If Q(x) is the product of distinct linear factors, use partial fractions of the form

• If Q(x) contains a repeated linear factor, (x −c)n, use partial fractions of the form

• If Q(x) contains an unfactorable quadratic q(x), try a partial fraction of the form

Chapter Seven INTEGRATION
To use this method, we must be able to integrate each partial fraction. We can integrate terms
of the form A/(x −c)n using the power rule (if n > 1) and logarithms (if n = 1). Next we see how
to integrate terms of the form (Ax + B)/q(x), where q(x) is an unfactorable quadratic.
Trigonometric Substitutions
Section 7.1 showed how substitutions could be used to transform complex integrands. Now we see
how substitution of sin θ or tan θ can be used for integrands involving square roots of quadratics or
unfactorable quadratics.
Sine Substitutions
Substitutions involving sin θ make use of the Pythagorean identity, cos2 θ + sin2 θ = 1, to simplify
an integrand involving
√
a2 −x2.
Example 6
Find
,
1
√
1 −x2 dx using the substitution x = sin θ.
Solution
If x = sin θ, then dx = cos θ dθ, and substitution converts 1 −x2 to a perfect square:
,
1
√
1 −x2 dx =
,


1 −sin2 θ
cos θ dθ =

cos θ

dθ.
Now either
√
cos2 θ = cos θ or
√
cos2 θ = −cosθ depending on the values taken by θ. If we choose
−π/2 ≤θ ≤π/2, then cos θ ≥0, so
√
cos2 θ = cos θ. Then
,
cos θ
√
cos2 θ
dθ =
, cos θ
cos θ dθ =
,
1 dθ = θ + C = arcsinx + C.
The last step uses the fact that θ = arcsin x if x = sin θ and −π/2 ≤θ ≤π/2.
From now on, when we substitute sin θ, we assume that the interval −π/2 ≤θ ≤π/2 has been
chosen. Notice that the previous example is the case a = 1 of VI-28 in the table of integrals. The
next example illustrates how to choose the substitution when a ̸= 1.
Example 7
Use a trigonometric substitution to ﬁnd
,
1
√
4 −x2 dx.
Solution
This time we choose x = 2 sin θ, with −π/2 ≤θ ≤π/2, so that 4 −x2 becomes a perfect square:

4 −x2 =

4 −4 sin2 θ = 2

1 −sin2 θ = 2
√
cos2 θ = 2 cos θ.
Then dx = 2 cosθ dθ, so substitution gives

√
4 −x2 dx =

The general rule for choosing a sine substitution is:
To simplify
√
a2 −x2, for constant a, try x = a sin θ, with −π/2 ≤θ ≤π/2.
Notice
√
a2 −x2 is only deﬁned on the interval [−a, a]. Assuming that the domain of the
integrand is [−a, a], the substitution x = a sin θ, with −π/2 ≤θ ≤π/2, is valid for all x in the
domain, because its range is [−a, a] and it has an inverse θ = arcsin(x/a) on [−a, a].

In Example 8, we did not return to the original variable x after making the substitution because
we had also converted the limits of the deﬁnite integral. However, if we are calculating an indeﬁnite
integral, we have to return to the original variable. In the next example, we see how a triangle
representing the substitution can be useful.

To rewrite the antiderivative in terms of the original variable x, we use the fact that sin θ = 2x/3
to write θ = arcsin(2x/3). To express cos θ in terms of x, we draw the right triangle in Figure 7.2

To simplify a2 + x2 or

Note that a2 + x2 and
√
a2 + x2 are deﬁned on (−∞, ∞). Assuming that the domain of the
integrand is (−∞, ∞), the substitution x = a tan θ, with −π/2 < θ < π/2, is valid for all x in the
domain, because its range is (−∞, ∞) and it has an inverse θ = arctan(x/a) on (−∞, ∞).

Completing the Square to Use a Trigonometric Substitution
To make a trigonometric substitution, we may ﬁrst need to complete the square.
Example 12
Find
,
3
√
2x −x2 dx.
Solution
To use a sine or tangent substitution, the expression under the square root sign should be in the form
a2 + x2 or a2 −x2. Completing the square, we get
2x −x2 = 1 −(x −1)2.
This suggests we substitute x −1 = sin θ, or x = sin θ + 1. Then dx = cos θ dθ, and

2x −x2 dx = 3 arcsin(x −1) + C.

NUMERICAL METHODS FOR DEFINITE INTEGRALS
Many functions do not have elementary antiderivatives. To evaluate the deﬁnite integrals of such
functions, we cannot use the Fundamental Theorem; we must use numerical methods. We know
how to approximate a deﬁnite integral numerically using left- and right-hand Riemann sums; in this
section, we introduce more accurate methods.
The Midpoint Rule
In the left- and right-hand Riemann sums, the heights of the rectangles are found using the left-hand
or right-hand endpoints, respectively, of the subintervals. For the midpoint rule, we use the midpoint
of each of the subintervals.
For example, in approximating
- 2
1 f(x) dx by a Riemann sum with two subdivisions, we ﬁrst
divide the interval 1 ≤x ≤2 into two pieces. The midpoint of the ﬁrst subinterval is 1.25 and
the midpoint of the second is 1.75. The heights of the two rectangles are f(1.25) and f(1.75),
respectively. (See Figure 7.4.) The Riemann sum is
f(1.25)0.5 + f(1.75)0.5.
Figure 7.4 shows that evaluating f at the midpoint of each subdivision often gives a better approxi-
mation to the area under the curve than evaluating f at either end.

Figure 7.4: Midpoint rule with two subdivisions
Thus, we have three ways of estimating an integral using a Riemann sum:
1. The left rule uses the left endpoint of each subinterval.
2. The right rule uses the right endpoint of each subinterval.
3. The midpoint rule uses the midpoint of each subinterval.
We write LEFT(n), RIGHT(n), and MID(n) to denote the results obtained by using these
rules with n subdivisions.
Example 1
For
, 2

x dx, compute LEFT(2), RIGHT(2) and MID(2), and compare your answers with the
exact value of the integral.
Solution
For n = 2 subdivisions of the interval [1, 2], we use Δx = 0.5. Then, to four decimal places,
LEFT(2) = f(1)(0.5) + f(1.5)(0.5) = 1
1(0.5) + 1
1.5(0.5) = 0.8333
RIGHT(2) = f(1.5)(0.5) + f(2)(0.5) = 1
1.5(0.5) + 1
2(0.5) = 0.5833
MID(2) = f(1.25)(0.5) + f(1.75)(0.5) =

With only two subdivisions, the left and right rules give quite poor approximations but the midpoint
rule is already fairly close to the exact answer. Figures 7.5(a) and (b) show that the midpoint rule
is more accurate than the left and right rules because the error to the left of the midpoint tends to
cancel the error to the right of the midpoint.
The Trapezoid Rule
We have just seen how the midpoint rule can have the effect of balancing out the errors of the left
and right rules. Another way of balancing these errors is to average the results from the left and
right rules. This approximation is called the trapezoid rule:
TRAP(n) = LEFT(n) + RIGHT(n)
2
.
The trapezoid rule averages the values of f at the left and right endpoints of each subinterval and
multiplies by Δx. This is the same as approximatingthe area under the graph of f in each subinterval
by a trapezoid (see Figure 7.6).

Solution
In the previous example we got LEFT(2) = 0.8333 and RIGHT(2) = 0.5833. The trapezoid rule
is the average of these, so TRAP(2) = 0.7083. (See Figure 7.5(c).) The exact value of the integral
is 0.6931, so the trapezoid rule is better than the left or right rules. The midpoint rule is still the best,
however, since MID(2) = 0.6857.

Is the Approximation an Over- or Underestimate?
It is useful to know when a rule is producing an overestimate and when it is producing an underes-
timate. In Chapter 5 we saw that if the integrand is increasing, the left rule underestimates and the
right rule overestimates the integral. If the integrand is decreasing, the roles reverse. Now we see
how concavity relates to the errors in the trapezoid and midpoint rules.
The Trapezoid Rule
If the graph of the function is concave down on [a, b], then each trapezoid lies below the graph and
the trapezoid rule underestimates. If the graph is concave up on [a, b], the trapezoid rule overesti-
mates. (See Figure 7.7.)
f concave down:
Trapezoid underestimates
f concave up:
Trapezoid overestimates
Figure 7.7: Error in the trapezoid rule
The Midpoint Rule
To understand the relationship between the midpoint rule and concavity, take a rectangle whose top
intersects the curve at the midpoint of a subinterval. Draw a tangent to the curve at the midpoint;
this gives a trapezoid. See Figure 7.8. (This is not the same trapezoid as in the trapezoid rule.)
The midpoint rectangle and the new trapezoid have the same area, because the shaded triangles in
Figure 7.8 are congruent. Hence, if the graph of the function is concave down, the midpoint rule
overestimates; if the graph is concave up, the midpoint rule underestimates. (See Figure 7.9.)
If the graph of f is concave down on [a, b], then
TRAP(n) ≤
, b

f(x) dx ≤MID(n).
If the graph of f is concave up on [a, b], then

Figure 7.9: Error in the midpoint rule
When we compute an approximation, we are always concerned about the error, namely the
difference between the exact answer and the approximation. We usually do not know the exact
error; if we did, we would also know the exact answer. We take
Error = Actual value −Approximate value.

390
Chapter Seven INTEGRATION
The errors for some methods are much smaller than those for others. In general, the midpoint and
trapezoid rules are more accurate than the left or right rules. Comparing the errors in the midpoint
and trapezoid rules suggests an even better method, called Simpson’s rule.
Error in Left and Right Rules
We work with the example
- 2
1 (1/x) dx because we know the exact value of this integral (ln 2) and
we can investigate the behavior of the errors.
Let us see what happens to the error in the left and right rules as we increase n. The results
are in Table 7.1. A positive error indicates that the Riemann sum is less than the exact value, ln 2.
Notice that the errors for the left and right rules have opposite signs but are approximately equal in
magnitude. (See Figure 7.10.) This leads us to want to average the left and right rules; this average
is the trapezoid rule.

Figure 7.10: Errors in left and right sums
There is another pattern to the errors in Table 7.1. If we compute the ratio of the errors in
Table 7.2, we see that the error8 in both the left and right rules decreases by a factor of about 5 as n
increases by a factor of 5.
There is nothing special about the number 5; the same holds for any factor. To get one extra
digit of accuracy in any calculation, we must make the error 1/10 as big, so we must increase n by
a factor of 10. In fact, for the left or right rules, each extra digit of accuracy requires about 10 times
the work.

Error in Trapezoid and Midpoint Rules
Table 7.3 shows that the trapezoid and midpoint rules generally produce better approximations to
- 2
1 (1/x) dx than the left and right rules.
Again there is a pattern to the errors. For each n, the midpoint rule is noticeably better than the
trapezoid rule; the error for the midpoint rule, in absolute value, seems to be about half the error of
the trapezoid rule. To see why, compare the shaded areas in Figure 7.11. Also, notice in Table 7.3
that the errors for the two rules have opposite signs; this is due to concavity.
8The values in Table 7.1 are rounded to 4 decimal places; those in Table 7.2 were computed using more decimal places
and then rounded.

Figure 7.11: Errors in the midpoint and
trapezoid rules
We are interested in how the errors behave as n increases. Table 7.4 gives the ratios of the
errors for each rule. For each rule, we see that as n increases by a factor of 5, the error decreases
by a factor of about 25 = 52. In fact, it can be shown that this squaring relationship holds for any
factor, so increasing n by a factor of 10 will decrease the error by a factor of about 100 = 102.
Reducing the error by a factor of 100 is equivalent to adding two more decimal places of accuracy
to the result. In other words: In the trapezoid or midpoint rules, each extra 2 digits of accuracy
requires about 10 times the work.

Simpson’s Rule
Observing that the trapezoid error has the opposite sign and about twice the magnitude of the mid-
point error, we may guess that a weighted average of the two rules, with the midpoint rule weighted
twice the trapezoid rule, has a smaller error. This approximation is called Simpson’s rule9:
SIMP(n) = 2 · MID(n) + TRAP(n)
3
.
Table 7.5 gives the errors for Simpson’s rule. Notice how much smaller the errors are than the
previous errors. Of course, it is a little unfair to compare Simpson’s rule at n = 50, say, with the
previous rules, because Simpson’s rule must compute the value of f at both the midpoint and the
endpoints of each subinterval and hence involves evaluating the function at twice as many points.
We see in Table 7.5 that as n increases by a factor of 5, the errors decrease by a factor of about
600, or about 54. Again this behavior holds for any factor, so increasing n by a factor of 10 decreases
the error by a factor of about 104. In other words: In Simpson’s rule, each extra 4 digits of accuracy
requires about 10 times the work.

Alternate Approach to Numerical Integration: Approximating by Lines and Parabolas
These rules for numerical integration can be obtained by approximating f(x) on subintervals by a
function:
• The left and right rules use constant functions.
• The trapezoid and midpoint rules use linear functions.
• Simpson’s rule uses quadratic functions.
Problems 36 and 37 on page 394 show how a quadratic approximation leads to Simpson’s rule.

IMPROPER INTEGRALS
Our original discussion of the deﬁnite integral
- b
a f(x) dx assumed that the interval a ≤x ≤b was
of ﬁnite length and that f was continuous. Integrals that arise in applications do not necessarily have
these nice properties. In this section we investigate a class of integrals, called improper integrals, in
which one limit of integration is inﬁnite or the integrand is unbounded. As an example, to estimate
the mass of the earth’s atmosphere, we might calculate an integral which sums the mass of the air
up to different heights. In order to represent the fact that the atmosphere does not end at a speciﬁc
height, we let the upper limit of integration get larger and larger, or tend to inﬁnity.
We consider improper integrals with positive integrands since they are the most common.
One Type of Improper Integral: When the Limit of Integration Is Infinite
Here is an example of an improper integral:
, ∞
1
1
x2 dx.
To evaluate this integral, we ﬁrst compute the deﬁnite integral
- b
1 (1/x2) dx:
, b
1
1
x2 dx = −x−1

b
1
= −1
b + 1
1.
Now take the limit as b →∞. Since
lim
b→∞
, b
1
1
x2 dx = lim
b→∞

−1
b + 1

= 1,
we say that the improper integral
- ∞
1 (1/x2) dx converges to 1.
If we think in terms of areas, the integral
- ∞
1 (1/x2) dx represents the area under f(x) = 1/x2
from x = 1 extending inﬁnitely far to the right. (See Figure 7.16(a).) It may seem strange that this
region has ﬁnite area. What our limit computations are saying is that
When b = 10:
, 10

x2 dx = −1
x


10 + 1 = 0.9
When b = 100:

100 + 1 = 0.99
When b = 1000:
, 1000
1
1
x2 dx = −
1
1000 + 1 = 0.999
and so on. In other words, as b gets larger and larger, the area between x = 1 and x = b tends to 1.
See Figure 7.16(b). Thus, it does make sense to declare that
- ∞
1 (1/x2) dx = 1.

Of course, in another example, we might not get a ﬁnite limit as b gets larger and larger. In that
case we say the improper integral diverges.
Suppose f(x) is positive for x ≥a.
If lim
b→∞
, b
a
f(x) dx is a ﬁnite number, we say that
, ∞
a
f(x) dx converges and deﬁne
, ∞

b→∞
, b
a
f(x) dx.
Otherwise, we say that
, ∞
a
f(x) dx diverges. We deﬁne
, b
−∞
f(x) dx similarly.
Similar deﬁnitions apply if f(x) is negative.
Example 1
Does the improper integral

We see that
- b
1 (1/√x) dx grows without bound as b →∞. We have shown that the area under the
curve in Figure 7.17 is not ﬁnite. Thus we say the integral
- ∞
1 (1/√x) dx diverges. We could also
say
- ∞
1 (1/√x) dx = ∞.
Notice that f(x) →0 as x →∞does not guarantee convergence of

What is the difference between the functions 1/x2 and 1/√x that makes the area under the
graph of 1/x2 approach 1 as x →∞, whereas the area under 1/√x grows very large? Both func-
tions approach 0 as x grows, so as b grows larger, smaller bits of area are being added to the deﬁnite

integral. The difference between the functions is subtle: the values of the function 1/√x don’t shrink
fast enough for the integral to have a ﬁnite value. Of the two functions, 1/x2 drops to 0 much faster
than 1/√x, and this feature keeps the area under 1/x2 from growing beyond 1.
Example 2
Find

First we consider

, b

Since e−5b = 1

is

Since e5x grows very rapidly, we expect that e−5x will approach 0 rapidly. The fact that the area
approaches 1/5 instead of growing without bound is a consequence of the speed with which the
integrand e−5x approaches 0.
Example 3

The important question is whether the exponent of b is positive or negative. If it is negative, then
as b approaches inﬁnity, b−p+1 approaches 0. If the exponent is positive, then b−p+1 grows without
bound as b approaches inﬁnity. What happens if p = 1? In this case we get

Since ln b becomes arbitrarily large as b approaches inﬁnity, the integral grows without bound. We

Application of Improper Integrals to Energy
The energy, E, required to separate two charged particles, originally a distance a apart, to a distance
b, is given by the integral
E =
, b
a
kq1q2
r2
dr
where q1 and q2 are the magnitudes of the charges and k is a constant. If q1 and q2 are in coulombs,
a and b are in meters, and E is in joules, the value of the constant k is 9 · 109.
Example 4
A hydrogenatom consists of a proton and an electron, with opposite charges of magnitude 1.6·10−19
coulombs. Find the energy required to take a hydrogen atom apart (that is, to move the electron from
its orbit to an inﬁnite distance from the proton). Assume that the initial distance between the electron
and the proton is the Bohr radius, RB = 5.3 · 10−11 meter.

Chapter Seven INTEGRATION
Solution
Since we are moving from an initial distance of RB to a ﬁnal distance of ∞, the energy is repre-
sented by the improper integral

Substituting numerical values, we get
E = (9 · 109)(1.6 · 10−19)2
5.3 · 10−11
≈4.35 · 10−18 joules.
This is about the amount of energy needed to lift a speck of dust 0.000000025 inch off the ground.
(In other words, not much!)
What happens if the limits of integration are −∞and ∞? In this case, we break the integral at
any point and write the original integral as a sum of two new improper integrals.
For a positive function f(x), we can use any (ﬁnite) number c to deﬁne
, ∞
−∞
f(x) dx =
, c
−∞
f(x) dx +
, ∞
c
f(x) dx.
If either of the two new improper integrals diverges, we say the original integral diverges.
Only if both of the new integrals have a ﬁnite value do we add the values to get a ﬁnite value
for the original integral.
It is not hard to show that the preceding deﬁnition does not depend on the choice for c.
Another Type of Improper Integral: When the Integrand Becomes Infinite
There is another way for an integral to be improper. The interval may be ﬁnite but the function
may be unbounded near some points in the interval. For example, consider
- 1
0 (1/√x) dx. Since the
graph of y = 1/√x has a vertical asymptote at x = 0, the region between the graph, the x-axis, and
the lines x = 0 and x = 1 is unbounded. Instead of extending to inﬁnity in the horizontal direction
as in the previous improper integrals, this region extends to inﬁnity in the vertical direction. See Fig-
ure 7.18(a). We handle this improper integral in a similar way as before: we compute
- 1
a (1/√x) dx
for values of a slightly larger than 0 and look at what happens as a approaches 0 from the positive
side. (This is written as a →0+.)
First we compute the integral:

Now we take the limit:
lim

, 1
a
1
√x dx = lim
a→0+(2 −2a1/2) = 2.
Since the limit is ﬁnite, we say the improper integral converges, and that
, 1
0
1
√x dx = 2.
Geometrically, what we have done is to calculate the ﬁnite area between x = a and x = 1 and
take the limit as a tends to 0 from the right. See Figure 7.18(b). Since the limit exists, the integral
converges to 2. If the limit did not exist, we would say the improper integral diverges.
Example 5
Investigate the convergence of
, 2

1
(x −2)2 dx.
Solution
This is an improper integral since the integrand tends to inﬁnity as x approaches 2 and is undeﬁned
at x = 2. Since the trouble is at the right endpoint, we replace the upper limit by b, and let b tend to
2 from the left. This is written b →2−, with the “−” signifying that 2 is approached from below.
See Figure 7.19.

Otherwise, we say that

When f(x) tends to inﬁnity as x approaches a, we deﬁne convergence in a similar way. In
addition, an integral can be improper because the integrand tends to inﬁnity inside the interval of
integration rather than at an endpoint. In this case, we break the given integral into two (or more)
improper integrals so that the integrand tends to inﬁnity only at endpoints.

Finally, there is a question of what to do when an integral is improper at both endpoints. In this
case, we just break the integral at any interior point of the interval. The original integral diverges if
either or both of the new integrals diverge.

This integral is improper both because the upper limit is ∞and because the function is undeﬁned at
x = 0. We break the integral into two parts at, say, x = 1. We know by Example 3 that
- ∞
1 (1/x2) dx
has a ﬁnite value. However, the other part,

COMPARISON OF IMPROPER INTEGRALS
Making Comparisons
Sometimes it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd the exact value of an improper integral by antidifferentiation, but it
may be possible to determine whether an integral converges or diverges. The key is to compare the
given integral to one whose behavior we already know. Let’s look at an example.
Example 1
Determine whether
, ∞
1
1
√
x3 + 5
dx converges.
Solution
First, let’s see what this integrand does as x →∞. For large x, the 5 becomes insigniﬁcant compared
with the x3, so
1
√
x3 + 5
≈
1
√
x3 =
1
x3/2 .
Since

b→∞

2 −2b−1/2
= 2,
the integral
- ∞
1 (1/x3/2) dx converges. So we expect our integral to converge as well.
In order to conﬁrm this, we observe that for 0 ≤x3 ≤x3 + 5, we have
1
√
x3 + 5
≤
1
√
x3 .
and so for b ≥1,
, b
1
1
√
x3 + 5 dx ≤

(See Figure 7.22.) Since

x3 + 5) dx increases as b approaches inﬁnity but is always smaller
than
- b
1 (1/x3/2) dx <
- ∞
1 (1/x3/2) dx = 2, we know
- ∞
1 (1/

less than 2. Thus,

Chapter Seven INTEGRATION
Notice that we ﬁrst looked at the behavior of the integrand as x →∞. This is useful because
the convergence or divergence of the integral is determined by what happens as x →∞.
The Comparison Test for
, ∞
a
f (x) dx
Assume f(x) is positive. Making a comparison involves two stages:
1. Guess, by looking at the behavior of the integrand for large x, whether the integral con-
verges or not. (This is the “behaves like” principle.)
2. Conﬁrm the guess by comparison with a positive function g(x):
• If f(x) ≤g(x) and
- ∞
a g(x) dx converges, then
- ∞
a f(x) dx converges.
• If g(x) ≤f(x) and - ∞
a g(x) dx diverges, then - ∞
a f(x) dx diverges.
Example 2
Decide whether
, ∞
4
dt
(ln t) −1 converges or diverges.
Solution
Since ln t grows without bound as t →∞, the −1 is eventually going to be insigniﬁcant in compar-
ison to ln t. Thus, as far as convergence is concerned,
, ∞
4
1
(ln t) −1 dt
behaves like
, ∞
4
1
ln t dt.
Does
- ∞
4 (1/ ln t) dt converge or diverge? Since ln t grows very slowly, 1/ ln t goes to zero very
slowly, and so the integral probably does not converge. We know that (ln t) −1 < ln t < t for all
positive t. So, provided t > e, we take reciprocals:
1
(ln t) −1 >
1
ln t > 1
t .
Since
- ∞
4 (1/t) dt diverges, we conclude that
, ∞
4
1
(ln t) −1 dt diverges.
How Do We Know What to Compare With?
In Examples 1 and 2, we investigated the convergence of an integral by comparing it with an easier
integral. How did we pick the easier integral? This is a matter of trial and error, guided by any infor-
mation we get by looking at the original integrand as x →∞. We want the comparison integrand
to be easy and, in particular, to have a simple antiderivative.
Useful Integrals for Comparison

•
, 1
0
1
xp dx converges for p < 1 and diverges for p ≥1.
•
, ∞
0

Of course, we can use any function for comparison, provided we can determine its behavior.
Example 3
Investigate the convergence of
, ∞
1
(sin x) + 3
√x
dx.

7.7 COMPARISON OF IMPROPER INTEGRALS
405
Solution
Since it looks difﬁcult to ﬁnd an antiderivative of this function, we try comparison. What happens
to this integrand as x →∞? Since sin x oscillates between −1 and 1,
2
√x = −1 + 3
√x
≤(sin x) + 3
√x
≤1 + 3
√x
=
4
√x,
the integrand oscillates between 2/√x and 4/√x. (See Figure 7.23.)
What do
- ∞
1 (2/√x) dx and
- ∞
1 (4/√x) dx do? As far as convergence is concerned, they cer-
tainly do the same thing, and whatever that is, the original integral does it too. It is important to
notice that √x grows very slowly. This means that 1/√x gets small slowly, which means that con-
vergence is unlikely. Since √x = x1/2, the result in the preceding box (with p = 1
2) tells us that
- ∞
1 (1/√x) dx diverges. So the comparison test tells us that the original integral diverges.

2
√x ≤(sin x) + 3
√x
or
(sin x) + 3
√x
≤
4
√x.
Since both
- ∞
1 (2/√x) dx and
- ∞
1 (4/√x) dx diverge, only the ﬁrst comparison is useful. Knowing
that an integral is smaller than a divergent integral is of no help whatsoever!
The next example shows what to do if the comparison does not hold throughout the interval of
integration.
Example 4
Show
, ∞
1
e−x2/2 dx converges.
Solution
We know that e−x2/2 goes very rapidly to zero as x →∞, so we expect this integral to con-
verge. Hence we look for some larger integrand which has a convergent integral. One possibility is
- ∞
1
e−x dx, because e−x has an elementary antiderivative and
- ∞
1
e−x dx converges. What is the
relationship between e−x2/2 and e−x? We know that for x ≥2,
x ≤x2
2
so
−x2
2 ≤−x,
and so, for x ≥2
e−x2/2 ≤e−x.
Since this inequality holds only for x ≥2, we split the interval of integration into two pieces:
, ∞
1
e−x2/2 dx =
, 2
1
e−x2/2 dx +
, ∞
2
e−x2/2 dx.
Now
- 2
1 e−x2/2 dx is ﬁnite (it is not improper) and
- ∞
2
e−x2/2 dx is ﬁnite by comparison with
- ∞
2
e−x dx. Therefore,
- ∞
1
e−x2/2 dx is the sum of two ﬁnite pieces and therefore must be ﬁnite.

Chapter Seven INTEGRATION
The previous example illustrates the following general principle:
If f is positive and continuous on [a, b],
, ∞
a
f(x) dx and
, ∞
b
f(x) dx
either both converge or both diverge.
In particular, when the comparison test is applied to
- ∞
a f(x) dx, the inequalities for f(x) and
g(x) do not need to hold for all x ≥a but only for x greater than some value, say b.

8.1
AREAS AND VOLUMES
In Chapter 5, we calculated areas under graphs using deﬁnite integrals. We obtained the integral
by slicing up the region, constructing a Riemann sum, and then taking a limit. In this section, we
calculate areas of other regions, as well as volumes, using deﬁnite integrals. To obtain the integral,
we again slice up the region and construct a Riemann sum.
Finding Areas by Slicing

Use horizontal slices to set up a deﬁnite integral to calculate the area of the isosceles triangle in
Figure 8.1.

Figure 8.2: Horizontal slices of isosceles triangle
Solution
Notice that we can ﬁnd the area of a triangle without using an integral; we will use this to check the
result from integration:
Area = 1
2 Base · Height = 25 cm2.
To calculate the area using horizontal slices we divide the region into strips; see Figure 8.2. A typical
strip is approximately a rectangle of length wi and width Δh, so
Area of strip ≈wiΔh cm2.
To get wi in terms of hi, the height above the base, use the similar triangles in Figure 8.2:
wi
10 = 5 −hi
5
wi = 2(5 −hi) = 10 −2hi.
Summing the areas of the strips gives the Riemann sum approximation:
Area of triangle ≈

Evaluating the integral gives

= 25 cm2.
Notice that the limits in the deﬁnite integral are the limits for the variable h. Once we decide to
slice the triangle horizontally, we know that a typical slice has thickness Δh, so h is the variable in
our deﬁnite integral, and the limits must be values of h.

Figure 8.4: Horizontal slices of semicircle
Solution
As in Example 1, to calculate the area using horizontal slices, we divide the region into strips; see
Figure 8.4. A typical strip at height hi above the base has width wi and thickness Δh, so
Area of strip ≈wiΔh cm2.
To get wi in terms of hi, we use the Pythagorean Theorem in Figure 8.4:

Finding Volumes by Slicing
To calculate the volume of a solid using Riemann sums, we chop the solid into slices whose volumes
we can estimate.

Chapter Eight USING THE DEFINITE INTEGRAL
Figure 8.5: Cone cut into
vertical slices
Figure 8.6: Cone cut into
horizontal slices
Let’s see how we might slice a cone standing with the vertex uppermost. We could divide the
cone vertically into arch-shaped slices; see Figure 8.5. We could also divide the cone horizontally,
giving coin-shaped slices; see Figure 8.6.
To calculate the volume of the cone, we choose the circular slices because it is easier to estimate
the volumes of the coin-shaped slices.
Example 3
Use horizontal slicing to ﬁnd the volume of the cone in Figure 8.7.

Figure 8.8: Vertical cross-section of cone in
Figure 8.7
Solution
Each slice is a circular disk of thickness Δh. See Figure 8.7. The disk at height hi above the base
has radius ri = 1
2wi. From Figure 8.8 and the previous example, we have
wi = 10 −2hi
so
ri = 5 −hi.
Each slice is approximately a cylinder of radius ri and thickness Δh, so
Volume of slice ≈πr2
i Δh = π(5 −hi)2Δh cm3.
Summing over all slices, we have
Volume of cone ≈

Note that the sum represented by the * sign is over all the strips. To simplify the notation, in
the future, we will not write limits for * or subscripts on the variable, since all we want is the ﬁnal
expression for the deﬁnite integral. We now calculate the volume of a hemisphere by slicing.

Figure 8.10: Vertical cut through center of hemisphere
showing relation between ri and hi
Solution
We will not use the formula 4
3πr3 for the volume of a sphere. However, our approach can be used
to derive that formula.
Divide the hemisphere into horizontal slices of thickness Δh cm. (See Figure 8.9.) Each slice
is circular. Let r be the radius of the slice at height h, so
Volume of slice ≈πr2Δh cm3.
We express r in terms of h using the Pythagorean Theorem as in Example 2. From Figure 8.10, we
have
h2 + r2 = 72,
so
r =

72 −h2 =

49 −h2.
Thus,
Volume of slice ≈πr2 Δh = π(72 −h2) Δh cm3.
Summing the volumes of all slices gives:
Volume ≈
+
πr2 Δh =
+
π(72 −h2) Δh cm3.
As the thickness of each slice tends to zero, the sum becomes a deﬁnite integral. Since the radius of
the hemisphere is 7, we know that h varies from 0 to 7, so these are the limits of integration:
Volume =

Notice that the volume of the hemisphere is half of 4

We now use slicing to ﬁnd the volume of a pyramid. We do not use the formula, V = 1
3b2 · h,
for the volume of a pyramid of height h and square base of side length b, but our approach can be
used to derive that formula.

Compute the volume, in cubic feet, of the Great Pyramid of Egypt, whose base is a square 755 feet
by 755 feet and whose height is 410 feet.
Solution
We slice the pyramid horizontally, creating square slices with thickness Δh. The bottom layer is
a square slice 755 feet by 755 feet and volume about (755)2Δh ft3. As we move up the pyramid,
the layers have shorter side lengths. We divide the height into n subintervals of length Δh. See
Figure 8.11. Let s be the side length of the slice at height h; then
Volume of slice ≈s2 Δh ft3.

APPLICATIONS TO GEOMETRY
In Section 8.1, we calculated volumes using slicing and deﬁnite integrals. In this section, we use the
same method to calculate the volumes of more complicated regions as well as the length of a curve.
The method is summarized in the following steps:
To Compute a Volume or Length Using an Integral
• Divide the solid (or curve) into small pieces whose volume (or length) we can easily
approximate;
• Add the contributions of all the pieces, obtaining a Riemann sum that approximates the
total volume (or length);
• Take the limit as the number of terms in the sum tends to inﬁnity, giving a deﬁnite integral
for the total volume (or total length).
In the previous section, all the slices we created were disks or rectangles. We now look at
different ways of generating volumes whose cross-sections include circles, rectangles, and also
rings.
Volumes of Revolution
One way to create a solid having circular cross-sections is to revolve a region in the plane around a
line, giving a solid of revolution, as in the following examples.
Example 1
The region bounded by the curve y = e−x and the x-axis between x = 0 and x = 1 is revolved
around the x-axis. Find the volume of this solid of revolution.
Solution
We slice the region perpendicular to the x-axis, giving circular disks of thickness Δx. See Fig-
ure 8.20. The radius of the disk is y = e−x, so:
Volume of the slice ≈πy2 Δx = π(e−x)2 Δx,
Total volume ≈

Example 2
A table leg in Figure 8.21 has a circular cross section with radius r cm at a height of y cm above the
ground given by r = 3 + cos(πy/25). Find the volume of the table leg.
Solution
The table leg is formed by rotating the curve r = 3 + cos(πy/25) around the y-axis. Slicing the
table leg horizontally gives circular disks of thickness Δy and radius r = 3 + cos(πy/25).
To set up a deﬁnite integral for the volume, we ﬁnd the volume of a typical slice:

As each strip is rotated around the line y = 3, it sweeps out a slice shaped like a circular disk with
a hole in it. See Figure 8.23. This disk-with-a-hole has an inner radius of rin = 3 −x and an outer
radius of rout = 3 −x2. Think of the slice as a circular disk of radius rout from which has been
removed a smaller disk of radius rin. Then:
Volume of slice ≈πr2

Volumes of Regions of Known Cross-Section
We now calculate the volume of a solid constructed by a different method. Starting with a region in
the xy-plane as a base, the solid is built by standing squares, semicircles, or triangles vertically on
edge in this region.
Example 4
Find the volume of the solid whose base is the region in the xy-plane bounded by the curves y = x2
and y = 8 −x2 and whose cross-sections perpendicular to the x-axis are squares with one side in
the xy-plane. (See Figure 8.25.)

Figure 8.26: A slice of the solid for Example 4
Solution
We view the solid as a loaf of bread sitting on the xy-plane and made up of square slices. A typical
slice of thickness Δx is shown in Figure 8.26. The side length, s, of the square is the distance (in
the y direction) between the two curves, so s = (8 −x2) −x2 = 8 −2x2, giving
Volume of slice ≈s2 Δx = (8 −2x2)2 Δx.
Thus
Total volume = V ≈
+
s2 Δx =
+
(8 −2x2)2 Δx.
As the thickness Δx of each slice tends to zero, the sum becomes a deﬁnite integral. Since the
curves y = x2 and y = 8 −x2 intersect at x = −2 and x = 2, these are the limits of integration.

Arc Length
A deﬁnite integral can be used to compute the arc length, or length, of a curve. To compute the
length of the curve y = f(x) from x = a to x = b, where a < b, we divide the curve into small
pieces, each one approximately straight.

Figure 8.27: Length of a small piece of curve approximated using Pythagoras’ theorem
Figure 8.27 shows that a small change Δx corresponds to a small change Δy ≈f ′(x) Δx. The

Length ≈

(Δx)2 + (Δy)2 ≈

(Δx)2 + (f ′(x) Δx)2 =

1 + (f ′(x))2 Δx.
Thus, the arc length of the entire curve is approximated by a Riemann sum:
Arc length ≈
+ !
1 + (f ′(x))2 Δx.
Since x varies between a and b, as we let Δx tend to zero, the sum becomes the deﬁnite integral:
For a < b, the arc length of the curve y = f(x) from x = a to x = b is given by
Arc length =

1 + (f ′(x))2 dx.
Example 5
Set up and evaluate an integral to compute the length of the curve y = x3 from x = 0 to x = 5.

If f(x) = x3, then f ′(x) = 3x2, so
Arc length =

Although the formula for the arc length of a curve is easy to apply, the integrands it generates
often do not have elementary antiderivatives. Evaluating the integral numerically, we ﬁnd the arc
length to be 125.68. To check that the answer is reasonable, notice that the curve starts at (0, 0) and
goes to (5, 125), so its length must be at least the length of a straight line between these points, or
√
52 + 1252 = 125.10. (See Figure 8.28.)

Arc Length of a Parametric Curve

where t is time, has speed given by:
v(t) =

We can ﬁnd the distance traveled by a particle along a curve between t = a and t = b by integrating
its speed. Thus,
Distance traveled =

a
v(t) dt.
If the particle never stops or reverses its direction as it moves along the curve, the distance it travels
is the same as the length of the curve. This suggests the following formula:
If a curve is given parametrically for a ≤t ≤b by differentiable functions and if the velocity
v(t) is not 0 for a < t < b, then

Since the ellipse is inscribed in a circle of radius 2 and circumscribes a circle of radius 1, we expect
the length of the ellipse to be between 2π(2) ≈12.57 and 2π(1) ≈6.28, so the value of 9.69 is
reasonable.

57. The design of boats is based on Archimedes’ Principle,
which states that the buoyant force on an object in wa-
ter is equal to the weight of the water displaced. Suppose
you want to build a sailboat whose hull is parabolic with
cross section y = ax2, where a is a constant. Your boat
will have length L and its maximum draft (the maximum
vertical depth of any point of the boat beneath the wa-
ter line) will be H. See Figure 8.37. Every cubic meter
of water weighs 10,000 newtons. What is the maximum
possible weight for your boat and cargo?

AREA AND ARC LENGTH IN POLAR COORDINATES
Many curves and regions in the plane are easier to describe in polar coordinates than in Cartesian
coordinates. Thus their areas and arc lengths are best found using integrals in polar coordinates.
A point, P, in the plane is often identiﬁed by its Cartesian coordinates (x, y), where x is the
horizontal distance to the point from the origin and y is the vertical distance.1 Alternatively, we
can identify the point, P, by specifying its distance, r, from the origin and the angle, θ, shown in
Figure 8.38. The angle θ is measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis to the line joining
P to the origin. The labels r and θ are called the polar coordinates of point P.

Chapter Eight USING THE DEFINITE INTEGRAL
Relation Between Cartesian and Polar Coordinates
From the right triangle in Figure 8.38, we see that
• x = r cos θ
and
y = r sin θ
• r =

x2 + y2 and tan θ = y
x, x ̸= 0
The angle θ is determined by the equations cos θ = x/

x2 + y2 and sin θ = y/

x2 + y2.
Warning: In general θ ̸= tan−1(y/x). It is not possible to determine which quadrant θ is in
from the value of tan θ alone.
Example 1
(a) Give Cartesian coordinates for the points with polar coordinates (r, θ) given by P = (7, π/3),
Q = (5, 0), R = (5, π).
(b) Give polar coordinates for the points with Cartesian coordinates (x, y) given by U = (3, 4) and
V = (0, −5).
Solution
(a) See Figure 8.39 on page 431. Point P is a distance of 7 from the origin. The angle θ is π/3
radians (60◦). The Cartesian coordinates of P are
x = r cos θ = 7 cos π
3 = 7
2
and
y = r sin θ = 7 sin π
3 = 7
√
3
2 .
Point Q is located a distance of 5 units along the positive x-axis with Cartesian coordinates
x = r cos θ = 5 cos0 = 5
and
y = r sin θ = 5 sin 0 = 0.
For point R, which is on the negative x-axis,
x = r cos θ = 5 cosπ = −5
and
y = r sin θ = 5 sin π = 0.
(b) For U = (3, 4), we have r =
√
32 + 42 = 5 and tan θ = 4/3. A possible value for θ is
θ = arctan4/3 = 0.927 radians, or about 53◦. The polar coordinates of U are (5, 0.927). The
point V falls on the negative y-axis, so we can choose r = 5, θ = 3π/2 for its polar coordinates.
In this case, we cannot use tan θ = y/x to ﬁnd θ, because tan θ = y/x = −5/0 is undeﬁned.
Because the angle θ can be allowed to wrap around the origin more than once, there are many
possibilities for the polar coordinates of a point. For the point V in Example 1, we can also choose
θ = −π/2 or θ = 7π/2, so that (5, −π/2), (5, 7π/2), and (5, 3π/2) are all polar coordinates for
V . However, we often choose θ between 0 and 2π.

Because r = 3 and θ = π/4, one set of polar coordinates for P is (3, π/4). We can also use
θ = π/4 + 2π = 9π/4 and θ = π/4 −2π = −7π/4, to get (3, 9π/4) and (3, −7π/4).

Graphing Equations in Polar Coordinates
The equations for certain graphs are much simpler when expressed in polar coordinates than in
Cartesian coordinates. On the other hand, some graphs that have simple equations in Cartesian
coordinates have complicated equations in polar coordinates.
Example 3
(a) Describe in words the graphs of the equation y = 1 (in Cartesian coordinates) and the equation
r = 1 (in polar coordinates).
(b) Write the equation r = 1 using Cartesian coordinates. Write the equation y = 1 using polar
coordinates.
Solution
(a) The equation y = 1 describes a horizontal line. Since the equation y = 1 places no restrictions
on the value of x, it describes every point having a y-value of 1, no matter what the value of
its x-coordinate. Similarly, the equation r = 1 places no restrictions on the value of θ. Thus, it
describes every point having an r-value of 1, that is, having a distance of 1 from the origin. This
set of points is the unit circle. See Figure 8.41.

(b) Since r =

x2 + y2, we rewrite the equation r = 1 using Cartesian coordinates as

x2 + y2 =
1, or, squaring both sides, as x2 + y2 = 1. We see that the equation for the unit circle is simpler
in polar coordinates than it is in Cartesian coordinates.
On the other hand, since y = r sin θ, we can rewrite the equation y = 1 in polar coordinates
as r sin θ = 1, or, dividing both sides by sin θ, as r = 1/ sin θ. We see that the equation for this
horizontal line is simpler in Cartesian coordinates than in polar coordinates.
Example 4
Graph the equation r = θ. The graph is called an Archimedean spiral after the Greek mathematician
Archimedes who described its properties (although not by using polar coordinates).
Solution
To construct this graph, use the values in Table 8.1. To help us visualize the shape of the spiral, we
convert the angles in Table 8.1 to degrees and the r-values to decimals. See Table 8.2.

Notice that as the angle θ increases, points on the curve move farther from the origin. At 0◦,
the point is at the origin. At 30◦, it is 0.52 units away from the origin, at 60◦it is 1.05 units away,
and at 90◦it is 1.57 units away. As the angle winds around, the point traces out a curve that moves
away from the origin, giving a spiral. (See Figure 8.42.)

434
Chapter Eight USING THE DEFINITE INTEGRAL
In our deﬁnition, r is positive. However, graphs of curves in polar coordinates are traditionally
drawn using negative values of r as well, because this makes the graphs symmetric. If an equation
r = f(θ) gives a negative r-value, it is plotted in the opposite direction to θ. See Examples 5 and 6
and Figures 8.43 and 8.45.
Example 5
For a > 0 and n a positive integer, curves of the form r = a sin nθ or r = a cos nθ are called roses.
Graph the roses
(a)
r = 3 sin 2θ
(b)
r = 4 cos 3θ
Solution
(a) Using a calculator or making a table of values, we see that the graph is a rose with four petals,
each extending a distance of 3 from base to tip. See Figure 8.43. Negative values of r for
π/2 < θ < π and 3π/2 < θ < 2π give the petals in Quadrants II and IV. For example,
θ = 3π/4 gives r = −3, which is plotted 3 units from the origin in the direction opposite to
θ = 3π/4, namely in Quadrant IV.
(b) The graph is a rose with three petals, each extending 4 from base to tip. See Figure 8.44.

Curves of the form r = a + b sin θ or r = a + b cosθ are called limac¸ons. Graph r = 1 + 2 cos θ
and r = 3 + 2 cos θ.
Solution
See Figures 8.45 and 8.46. The equation r = 1+2 cosθ leads to negative r values for some θ values
between π/2 and 3π/2; these values give the inner loop in Figure 8.45. For example, θ = π gives
r = −1, which is plotted 1 unit from the origin in the direction opposite to θ = π, namely on the
positive x-axis. The equation r = 3 + 2 cosθ does not lead to negative r-values.

Polar coordinates can be used with inequalities to describe regions that are obtained from cir-
cles. Such regions are often much harder to represent in Cartesian coordinates.

Example 7
Using inequalities, describe a compact disc with outer diameter 120 mm and inner diameter 15 mm.
Solution
The compact disc lies between two circles of radius 7.5 mm and 60 mm. See Figure 8.47. Thus, if
the origin is at the center, the disc is represented by
7.5 ≤r ≤60

origin is at the center of the original pizza, the slice is represented by
0 ≤r ≤9

Area in Polar Coordinates
We can use a deﬁnite integral to ﬁnd the area of a region described in polar coordinates. As previ-
ously, we slice the region into small pieces, construct a Riemann sum, and take a limit to obtain the
deﬁnite integral. In this case, the slices are approximately circular sectors.
To calculate the area of the sector in Figure 8.49, we think of the area of the sector as a fraction
θ/2π of the area of the entire circle (for θ in radians). Then
Area of sector = θ

Slope in Polar Coordinates
For a curve r = f(θ), we can express x and y in terms of θ as a parameter, giving
x = r cos θ = f(θ) cos θ
and
y = r sin θ = f(θ) sin θ.
To ﬁnd the slope of the curve, we use the formula for the slope of a parametric curve
dy
dx = dy/dθ
dx/dθ.
Example 11
Find the slope of the curve r = 3 sin 2θ at θ = π/3.
Solution
Expressing x and y in terms of θ, we have
x = 3 sin(2θ) cos θ
and
y = 3 sin(2θ) sin θ.
The slope is given by

DENSITY AND CENTER OF MASS
Density and How to Slice a Region
The examples in this section involve the idea of density. For example,
• A population density is measured in, say, people per mile (along the edge of a road), or people
per unit area (in a city), or bacteria per cubic centimeter (in a test tube).
• The density of a substance (e.g. air, wood, or metal) is the mass of a unit volume of the substance
and is measured in, say, grams per cubic centimeter.
Suppose we want to calculate the total mass or total population, but the density is not constant over
a region.

440
Chapter Eight USING THE DEFINITE INTEGRAL
To ﬁnd total quantity from density: Divide the region into small pieces in such a way that
the density is approximately constant on each piece, and add the contributions of the pieces.
Example 1
The Massachusetts Turnpike (“the Pike”) starts in the middle of Boston and heads west. The number
of people living next to it varies as it gets farther from the city. Suppose that, x miles out of town,
the population density adjacent to the Pike is P = f(x) people/mile. Express the total population
living next to the Pike within 5 miles of Boston as a deﬁnite integral.
Solution
Divide the Pike up into segments of length Δx. The population density at the center of Boston is
f(0); let’s use that density for the ﬁrst segment. This gives an estimate of
People living in ﬁrst segment ≈f(0) people/ mile · Δx mile = f(0)Δx people.

Similarly, the population in a typical segment x miles from the center of Boston is the population
density times the length of the interval, or roughly f(x) Δx. (See Figure 8.53.) The sum of all these
estimates gives the estimate
Total population ≈

f(x) Δx.
Letting Δx →0 gives

The 5 and 0 in the limits of the integral are the upper and lower limits of the interval over which we
are integrating.
Example 2
The air density h meters above the earth’s surface is f(h) kg/m3. Find the mass of a cylindrical
column of air 2 meters in diameter and 25 kilometers high, with base on the surface of the earth.
Solution
The column of air is a circular cylinder 2 meters in diameter and 25 kilometers, or 25,000 meters,
high. First we must decide how we are going to slice this column. Since the air density varies with
altitude but remains constant horizontally, we take horizontal slices of air. That way, the density will
be more or less constant over the whole slice, being close to its value at the bottom of the slice. (See
Figure 8.54.)

8.4 DENSITY AND CENTER OF MASS
441
A slice is a cylinder of height Δh and diameter 2 m, so its radius is 1 m. We ﬁnd the approximate
mass of the slice by multiplying its volume by its density. If the thickness of the slice is Δh, then
its volume is πr2 · Δh = π12 · Δh = π Δh m3. The density of the slice is given by f(h). Thus,
Mass of slice ≈Volume · Density = (πΔh m3)(f(h) kg/m3) = π Δh · f(h) kg.
Adding these slices up yields a Riemann sum:
Total mass ≈
+
πf(h) Δh kg.
As Δh →0, this sum approximates the deﬁnite integral:
Total mass =

πf(h) dh kg.
In order to get a numerical value for the mass of air, we need an explicit formula for the density
as a function of height, as in the next example.

Find the mass of the column of air in Example 2 if the density of air at height h is given by
P = f(h) = 1.28e−0.000124h kg/m3.

It requires some thought to ﬁgure out how to slice a region. The key point is that you want the
density to be nearly constant within each piece.
Example 4
The population density in Ringsburg is a function of the distance from the city center. At r miles
from the center, the density is P = f(r) people per square mile. Ringsburg is circular with radius 5
miles. Write a deﬁnite integral that expresses the total population of Ringsburg.
Solution
We want to slice Ringsburg up and estimate the population of each slice. If we were to take straight-
line slices, the population density would vary on each slice, since it depends on the distance from the
city center. We want the population density to be pretty close to constant on each slice. We therefore
take slices that are thin rings around the center. (See Figure 8.55.) Since the ring is very thin, we can
approximate its area by straightening it into a thin rectangle. (See Figure 8.56.) The width of the
rectangle is Δr miles, and its length is approximately equal to the circumference of the ring, 2πr
miles, so its area is about 2πr Δr mi2. Since
Population on ring ≈Density · Area,
we get
Population on ring ≈(f(r) people/mi2)(2πrΔr mi2) = f(r) · 2πr Δr people.
Adding the contributions from each ring, we get
Total population ≈
+
2πrf(r) Δr people.
So
Total population =

2πrf(r) dr people.

Note: You may wonder what happens if we calculate the area of the ring by subtracting the area of
the inner circle (πr2) from the area of the outer circle (π(r + Δr)2), giving
Area = π(r + Δr)2 −πr2.
Multiplying out and subtracting, we get
Area = π(r2 + 2r Δr + (Δr)2) −πr2
= 2πr Δr + π(Δr)2.
This expression differs from the one we used before by the π(Δr)2 term. However, as Δr
becomes very small, π(Δr)2 becomes much, much smaller. We say its smallness is of second order,
since the power of the small factor, Δr, is 2. In the limit as Δr →0, we can ignore π(Δr)2.
Center of Mass
The center of mass of a mechanical system is important for studying its behavior when in motion.
For example, some sport utility vehicles and light trucks tend to tip over in accidents, because of
their high centers of mass.
In this section, we ﬁrst deﬁne the center of mass for a system of point masses on a line. Then
we use the deﬁnite integral to extend this deﬁnition.
Point Masses
Two children on a seesaw, one twice the weight of the other, will balance if the lighter child is twice
as far from the pivot as the heavier child. Thus, the balance point is 2/3 of the way from the lighter
child and 1/3 of the way from the heavier child. This balance point is the center of mass of the
mechanical system consisting of the masses of the two children (we ignore the mass of the seesaw
itself). See Figure 8.57.
To ﬁnd the balance point, we use the displacement (signed distance) of each child from the
pivot to calculate the moment, where
Moment of mass about pivot = Mass × Displacement from pivot.
A moment represents the tendency of a child to turn the system about the pivot point; the seesaw
balances if the total moment is zero. Thus, the center of mass is the point about which the total
moment is zero.

8.4 DENSITY AND CENTER OF MASS
443
Example 5
Calculate the position of the center of mass of the children in Figure 8.57 using moments.
Solution
Suppose the center of mass in Figure 8.58 is at a distance of ¯x from the left end. The moment of
the left mass about the center of mass is −2m¯x (it is negative since it is to the left of the center of
mass); the moment of the right mass about the center of mass is m(l −¯x). The system balances if
−2m¯x + m(l −¯x) = 0
or
ml −3m¯x = 0
so
¯x = 1
3l.
Thus, the center of mass is l/3 from the left end.
We use the same method to calculate the center of mass, ¯x, of the system in Figure 8.59. The
sum of the moments of the three masses about ¯x is 0, so
m1(x1 −¯x) + m2(x2 −¯x) + m3(x3 −¯x) = 0.
Solving for ¯x, we get
m1¯x + m2¯x + m3¯x = m1x1 + m2x2 + m3x3
¯x = m1x1 + m2x2 + m3x3

x =

Continuous Mass Density
Instead of discrete masses arranged along the x-axis, suppose we have an object lying on the x-axis
between x = a and x = b. At point x, suppose the object has mass density (mass per unit length)
of δ(x). To calculate the center of mass of such an object, divide it into n pieces, each of length

Figure 8.60: Calculating the center of mass of an object of variable density, δ(x)

length. See Figure 8.60. Thus, if xi is a point in the ith piece,
Mass of the ith piece, mi ≈δ(xi)Δx.
Then the formula for the center of mass, ¯x = * ximi/ *mi, applied to the n pieces of the
object gives
¯x =
* xiδ(xi)Δx
* δ(xi)Δx .
In the limit as n →∞we have the following formula:
The center of mass x of an object lying along the x-axis between x = a and x = b is
x =

where δ(x) is the density (mass per unit length) of the object.
As in the discrete case, the denominator is the total mass of the object.

Find the center of mass of a 2-meter rod lying on the x-axis with its left end at the origin if:
(a)
The density is constant and the total mass is 5 kg.
(b)
The density is δ(x) = 15x2 kg/m.
Solution
(a) Since the density is constant along the rod, we expect the balance point to be in the middle, that
is, ¯x = 1. To check this, we compute ¯x. The density is the total mass divided by the length, so
δ(x) = 5/2 kg/m. Then

8.4 DENSITY AND CENTER OF MASS

Two- and Three-Dimensional Regions
For a system of masses that lies in the plane, the center of mass is a point with coordinates (¯x, ¯y).
In three dimensions, the center of mass is a point with coordinates (¯x, ¯y, ¯z). To compute the center
of mass in three dimensions, we use the following formulas in which Ax(x) is the area of a slice
perpendicular to the x-axis at x, and Ay(y) and Az(z) are deﬁned similarly. In two dimensions,
we use the same formulas for ¯x and ¯y, but we interpret Ax(x) and Ay(y) as the lengths of strips
perpendicular to the x- and y-axes, respectively.
For a region of constant density δ, the center of mass is given by
¯x =
- xδAx(x) dx
Mass
¯y =
- yδAy(y) dy

¯z =
- zδAz(z) dz
Mass
.
The expression δAx(x)Δx is the moment of a slice perpendicular to the x-axis. Thus, these for-
mulas are extensions of that on page 444. In the two- and three-dimensional case, we are assuming
that the density δ is constant. If the density is not constant, ﬁnding the center of mass may require a
double or triple integral from multivariable calculus.

Figure 8.62: Sliced triangle
Solution
Because the mass of the triangle is symmetrically distributed with respect to the x-axis, ¯y = 0. We
expect ¯x to be closer to x = 0 than to x = 1, since the triangle is wider near the origin.
The area of the triangle is 1
2 · 1 · 1 = 1
2. Thus, Density = Mass/Area = 2m. If we slice the
triangle into strips of width Δx, then the strip at position x has length Ax(x) = 2· 1

(See Figure 8.62.) So

Example 9
Find the center of mass of a hemisphere of radius 7 cm and constant density δ.
Solution
Stand the hemisphere with its base horizontal in the xy-plane, with the center at the origin. Symme-
try tells us that its center of mass lies directly above the center of the base, so ¯x = ¯y = 0. Since the
hemisphere is wider near its base, we expect the center of mass to be nearer to the base than the top.
To calculate the center of mass, slice the hemisphere into horizontal disks, as in Figure 8.63. A
disk of thickness Δz at height z above the base has
Volume of disk = Az(z)Δz ≈π(72 −z2)Δz cm3.

APPLICATIONS TO PHYSICS
Although geometric problems were a driving force for the development of the calculus in the seven-
teenth century, it was Newton’s spectacularly successful applications of the calculus to physics that
most clearly demonstrated the power of this new mathematics.
Work
In physics the word “work” has a technical meaning which is different from its everyday meaning.
Physicists say that if a constant force, F, is applied to some object to move it a distance, d, then
the force has done work on the object. The force must be parallel to the motion (in the same or the
opposite direction). We make the following deﬁnition:
Work done = Force · Distance
or
W = F · d.
Notice that if we walk across a room holding a book, we do no work on the book, since the
force we exert on the book is vertical, but the motion of the book is horizontal. On the other hand,
if we lift the book from the ﬂoor to a table, we accomplish work.
There are several sets of units in common use. To measure work, we will generally use the two
sets of units, International (SI) and British, in the following table.
Force

newton (nt)
meter (m)

1 lb = 4.45 nt
1 ft = 0.305 m
1 ft-lb = 1.36 joules

Chapter Eight USING THE DEFINITE INTEGRAL
One joule of work is done when a force of 1 newton moves an object through 1 meter, so
1 joule = 1 newton-meter.
Example 1
Calculate the work done on an object when
(a)
A force of 2 newtons moves it 12 meters.
(b)
A 3-lb force moves it 4 feet.
Solution
(a)
Work done = 2 nt · 12 m = 24 joules.
(b)
Work done = 3 lb · 4 ft = 12 ft-lb.
In the previous example, the force was constant and we calculated the work by multiplication.
In the next example, the force varies, so we need an integral. We divide up the distance moved and
sum to get a deﬁnite integral representing the work.
Example 2
Hooke’s Law says that the force, F, required to compress the spring in Figure 8.68 by a distance x,
in meters, is given by F = kx, for some constant k. Find the work done in compressing the spring
by 0.1 m if k = 8 nt/m.

Figure 8.69: Work done in compressing

Solution
Since k is in newtons/meter and x is in meters, we have F = 8x newtons. Since the force varies
with x, we divide the distance moved into small increments, Δx, as in Figure 8.69. Then
Work done in moving through an increment ≈FΔx = 8xΔx joules.
So, summing over all increments gives the Riemann sum approximation
Total work done ≈

The Force Due to Gravity: Mass versus Weight
When an object is lifted, work is done against the force exerted by gravity on the object. By New-
ton’s Second Law, the downward gravitational force acting on a mass m is mg, where g is the
acceleration due to gravity. To lift the object, we need to exert a force equal to the gravitational
force but in the opposite direction.

8.5 APPLICATIONS TO PHYSICS
451
In International units, g = 9.8 m/sec2, and we usually measure mass, m, in kilograms. In
British units, mass is seldom used. Instead, we usually talk about the weight of an object, which is
the force exerted by gravity on the object. Roughly speaking, the mass represents the quantity of
matter in an object, whereas the weight represents the force of gravity on it. The mass of an object
is the same everywhere, whereas the weight can vary if, for example, the object is moved to outer
space where gravitational forces are smaller.
When we are given the weight of an object, we do not multiply by g to ﬁnd the gravitational
force as it has already been done. In British units, a pound is a unit of weight. In International units,
a kilogram is a unit of mass, and the unit of weight is a newton, where 1 newton = 1 kg · m/sec2.
Example 3
How much work is done in lifting
(a)
A 5-pound book 3 feet off the ﬂoor?
(b)
A 1.5-kilogram book 2 meters off the ﬂoor?
Solution
(a) The force due to gravity is 5 lb, so W = F · d = (5 lb)(3 ft) = 15 foot-pounds.
(b) The force due to gravity is mg = (1.5 kg)(g m/sec2), so
W = F · d = [(1.5 kg)(9.8 m/sec2)] · (2 m) = 29.4 joules.
In the previous example, work is found by multiplication. In the next example, different parts
of the object move different distances, so an integral is needed.
Example 4
A 28-meter uniform chain with a mass density of 2 kilograms per meter is dangling from the roof
of a building. How much work is needed to pull the chain up onto the top of the building?
Solution
Since 1 meter of the chain has mass density 2 kg, the gravitational force per meter of chain is
(2 kg)(9.8 m/sec2) = 19.6 newtons. Let’s divide the chain into small sections of length Δy, each
requiring a force of 19.6 Δy newtons to move it against gravity. See Figure 8.70. If Δy is small, all
of this piece is hauled up approximately the same distance, namely y, so
Work done on the small piece ≈(19.6 Δy newtons)(y meters) = 19.6y Δy joules.
The work done on the entire chain is given by the total of the work done on each piece:
Work done ≈
+
19.6y Δy joules.
As Δy →0, we obtain a deﬁnite integral. Since y varies from 0 to 28 meters, the total work is

Solution
We assume that the stones were originally located at the approximate height of the construction site.
Imagine the pyramid built in layers as we did in Example 5 on page 418.
By similar triangles, the layer at height h has a side length s = 755(410 −h)/410 ft. (See
Figure 8.73.) The layer at height h has a volume of s2 Δh ft3, so its weight is 200s2 Δh lb. This
layer is lifted through a height of h, so
Work to lift layer = (200s2 Δh lb)(h ft) = 200s2h Δh ft-lb.
Summing over all layers gives

We have calculated the total work done in building the pyramid; now we want to estimate the total
number of workers needed. Let’s assume every laborer worked 10 hours a day, 300 days a year,
for 20 years. Assume that a typical worker lifted ten 50 pound blocks a distance of 4 feet every
hour, thus performing 2000 foot-pounds of work per hour (this is a very rough estimate). Then
each laborer performed (10)(300)(20)(2000) = 1.2 · 108 foot-pounds of work over a twenty-year

We can use the deﬁnite integral to compute the force exerted by a liquid on a surface, for example,
the force of water on a dam. The idea is to get the force from the pressure. The pressure in a liquid
is the force per unit area exerted by the liquid. Two things you need to know about pressure are:
• At any point, pressure is exerted equally in all directions—up, down, sideways.
• Pressure increases with depth. (That is one of the reasons why deep sea divers have to take
much greater precautions than scuba divers.)
At a depth of h meters, the pressure, p, exerted by the liquid, measured in newtons per square
meter, is given by computing the total weight of a column of liquid h meters high with a base of 1
square meter. The volume of such a column of liquid is just h cubic meters. If the liquid has density
δ (mass per unit volume), then its weight per unit volume is δg, where g is the acceleration due to
gravity. The weight of the column of liquid is δgh, so

454
Chapter Eight USING THE DEFINITE INTEGRAL
Pressure = Mass density · g · Depth
or
p = δgh.
Provided the pressure is constant over a given area, we also have the following relation:
Force = Pressure · Area.
The units and data we will generally use are given in the following table:

1 lb = 4.45 nt

In International units, the mass density of water is 1000 kg/m3, so the pressure at a depth of h
meters is δgh = 1000 · 9.8h = 9800h nt/m2. See Figure 8.74.
In British units, the density of the liquid is usually given as a weight per unit volume, rather
than a mass per unit volume. In that case, we do not need to multiply by g because it has already
been done. For example, water weighs 62.4 lb/ft3, so the pressure at depth h feet is 62.4h lb/ft2. See
Figure 8.75.

If the pressure is constant over a surface, we calculate the force on the surface by multiplying
the pressure by the area of the surface. If the pressure is not constant, we divide the surface into
small pieces in such a way that the pressure is nearly constant on each one to obtain a deﬁnite
integral for the force on the surface. Since the pressure varies with depth, we divide the surface into
horizontal strips, each of which is at an approximately constant depth.
Example 7
In 1912, the ocean liner Titanic sank to the bottom of the Atlantic, 12,500 feet (nearly 2.5 miles)
below the surface. Find the force on one side of a 100-foot square plate at the depth of the Titanic if
the plate is: (a)
Lying horizontally
(b)
Standing vertically.
Solution
(a) When the plate is horizontal, the pressure is the same at every point on the plate, so
Pressure = 62.4 lb/ft3 · 12,500 ft = 780,000 lb/ft2.
To imagine this pressure, convert to pounds per square inch, giving 780,000/144 ≈5400 lb/in2.
For the horizontal plate
Force = 780,000 lb/ft2 · 1002 ft2 = 7.8 · 109 pounds.

(b) When the plate is vertical, only the bottom is at 12,500 feet; the top is at 12,400 feet. Dividing
into horizontal strips of width Δh, as in Figure 8.76, we have
Area of strip = 100Δh ft2.
Since the pressure on a strip at a depth of h feet is 62.4h lb/ft2,
Force on strip ≈62.4h · 100Δh = 6240hΔh pounds.
Summing over all strips and taking the limit as Δh →0 gives a deﬁnite integral. The strips vary
in depth from 12,400 to 12,500 feet, so

Figure 8.78: Dividing dam into horizontal strips
Solution
(a) Since the density of water is δ = 1000 kg/m3, at the base of the dam,
Water pressure = δgh = 1000 · 9.8 · 220 = 2.156 · 106 nt/m2.

Chapter Eight USING THE DEFINITE INTEGRAL
(b) To calculate the force on the dam, we divide the dam into horizontal strips because the pressure
along each strip is approximately constant. See Figure 8.78. Since each strip is approximately
rectangular,
Area of strip ≈wΔh m2.
The pressure at a depth of h meters is δgh = 9800h nt/m2. Thus,
Force on strip ≈Pressure · Area = 9800hwΔh nt.
To ﬁnd w in terms of h, we use the fact that w decreases linearly from w = 400 when h = 0
to w = 200 when h = 220. Thus w is a linear function of h, with slope (200 −400)/220 =
−10/11, so
w = 400 −10

Present and Future Value
Many business deals involve payments in the future. If you buy a car or furniture, for example, you
may buy it on credit and pay over a period of time. If you are going to accept payment in the future
under such a deal, you obviously need to know how much you should be paid. Being paid $100 in
the future is clearly worse than being paid $100 today for many reasons. If you are given the money
today, you can do something else with it—for example, put it in the bank, invest it somewhere, or
spend it. Thus, even without considering inﬂation, if you are to accept payment in the future, you
would expect to be paid more to compensate for this loss of potential earnings. The question we will
consider now is, how much more?
To simplify matters, we consider only what we would lose by not earning interest; we will not
consider the effect of inﬂation. Let’s look at some speciﬁc numbers. Suppose you deposit $100 in
an account which earns 3% interest compounded annually, so that in a year’s time you will have
$103. Thus, $100 today will be worth $103 a year from now. We say that the $103 is the future
value of the $100, and that the $100 is the present value of the $103. Observe that the present value
is smaller than the future value. In general, we say the following:
• The future value, $B, of a payment, $P, is the amount to which the $P would have
grown if deposited in an interest-bearing bank account.
• The present value, $P, of a future payment, $B, is the amount which would have to be
deposited in a bank account today to produce exactly $B in the account at the relevant
time in the future.
With an interest rate of r, compounded annually, and a time period of t years, a deposit of $P
grows to a future balance of $B, where

460
Chapter Eight USING THE DEFINITE INTEGRAL
B = P(1 + r)t,
or equivalently,
P =
B
(1 + r)t .
Note that for a 3% interest rate, r = 0.03. If instead of annual compounding, we have continuous
compounding, we get the following result:
B = Pert,
or equivalently,
P = B
ert = Be−rt.
Example 1
You win the lottery and are offered the choice between $1 million in four yearly installments of
$250,000 each, starting now, and a lump-sum payment of $920,000 now. Assuming a 6% interest
rate, compounded continuously, and ignoring taxes, which should you choose?
Solution
We will do the problem in two ways. First, we assume that you pick the option with the largest
present value. The ﬁrst of the four $250,000 payments is made now, so
Present value of ﬁrst payment = $250,000.
The second payment is made one year from now, so
Present value of second payment = $250,000e−0.06(1).
Calculating the present value of the third and fourth payments similarly, we ﬁnd:
Total present value = $250,000 + $250,000e−0.06(1) + $250,000e−0.06(2) + $250,000e−0.06(3)
≈$250,000 + $235,441 + $221,730 + $208,818
= $915,989.
Since the present value of the four payments is less than $920,000, you are better off taking the
$920,000 right now.
Alternatively, we can compare the future values of the two pay schemes. The scheme with the
highest future value is the best from a purely ﬁnancial point of view. We calculate the future value
of both schemes three years from now, on the date of the last $250,000 payment. At that time,
Future value of the lump sum payment = $920,000e0.06(3) ≈$1,101,440.
Now we calculate the future value of the ﬁrst $250,000 payment:
Future value of the ﬁrst payment = $250,000e0.06(3).
Calculating the future value of the other payments similarly, we ﬁnd:
Total future value = $250,000e0.06(3) + $250,000e0.06(2) + $250,000e0.06(1) + $250,000
≈$299,304 + $281,874 + $265,459 + $250,000
= $1,096,637.
The future value of the $920,000 payment is greater, so you are better off taking the $920,000 right
now. Of course, since the present value of the $920,000 payment is greater than the present value
of the four separate payments, you would expect the future value of the $920,000 payment to be
greater than the future value of the four separate payments.
(Note: If you read the ﬁne print, you will ﬁnd that many lotteries do not make their payments right
away, but often spread them out, sometimes far into the future. This is to reduce the present value
of the payments made, so that the value of the prizes is much less than it might ﬁrst appear!)

Income Stream
When we consider payments made to or by an individual, we usually think of discrete payments,
that is, payments made at speciﬁc moments in time. However, we may think of payments made by
a company as being continuous. The revenues earned by a huge corporation, for example, come in
essentially all the time and can be represented by a continuous income stream, written
P(t) dollars/year.
Notice that P(t) is the rate at which deposits are made (its units are dollars per year, for example)
and that this rate may vary with time, t.
Present and Future Values of an Income Stream
Just as we can ﬁnd the present and future values of a single payment, so we can ﬁnd the present and
future values of a stream of payments. We will assume that interest is compounded continuously.
Suppose that we want to calculate the present value of the income stream described by a rate of
P(t) dollars per year, and that we are interested in the period from now until M years in the future.
We divide the stream into many small deposits, each of which is made at approximately one instant.

Assuming Δt is small, the rate, P(t), at which deposits are being made will not vary much
within one subinterval. Thus, between t and t + Δt:
Amount deposited ≈Rate of deposits × Time
≈(P(t) dollars/year)(Δt years)
= P(t)Δt dollars.
Measured from the present, the deposit of P(t)Δt is made t years in the future. Thus,
Present value of money deposited
in interval t to t + Δt
≈P(t)Δte−rt.
Summing over all subintervals gives
Total present value ≈
+
P(t)e−rtΔt dollars.
In the limit as Δt →0, we get the following integral:
Present value =

P(t)e−rtdt dollars.
In computing future value, the deposit of P(t)Δt has a period of (M −t) years to earn interest, and
therefore
Future value of money deposited
in interval t to t + Δt
≈(P(t)Δt) er(M−t).
Summing over all subintervals, we get:
Total future value ≈
+
P(t)Δter(M−t) dollars.

In addition, by writing er(M−t) = erM · e−rt and factoring out erM, we see that

$43,895.58 of the future value comes from interest earned.
Supply and Demand Curves
In a free market, the quantity of a certain item produced and sold can be described by the supply
and demand curves of the item. The supply curve shows the quantity of the item the producers will
supply at different price levels. It is usually assumed that as the price increases, the quantity supplied
will increase. The consumers’ behavior is reﬂected in the demand curve, which shows what quantity
of goods are bought at various prices. An increase in price is usually assumed to cause a decrease
in the quantity purchased. See Figure 8.83.

It is assumed that the market settles to the equilibrium price and quantity, p∗and q∗, where the
graphs cross. At equilibrium, a quantity q∗of an item is produced and sold for a price of p∗each.
Consumer and Producer Surplus
Notice that at equilibrium, a number of consumers have bought the item at a lower price than they
would have been willing to pay. (For example, there are some consumers who would have been

8.6 APPLICATIONS TO ECONOMICS
463
willing to pay prices up to p1.) Similarly, there are some suppliers who would have been willing to
produce the item at a lower price (down to p0, in fact). We deﬁne the following terms:
• The consumer surplus measures the consumers’ gain from trade. It is the total amount
gained by consumers by buying the item at the current price rather than at the price they
would have been willing to pay.
• The producer surplus measures the suppliers’ gain from trade. It is the total amount
gained by producers by selling at the current price, rather than at the price they would
have been willing to accept.
In the absence of price controls, the current price is assumed to be the equilibrium price.
Both consumers and producers are richer for having traded. The consumer and producer surplus
measure how much richer they are.
Suppose that all consumers buy the good at the maximum price they are willing to pay. Divide
the interval from 0 to q∗into subintervals of length Δq. Figure 8.84 shows that a quantity Δq of
items are sold at a price of about p1, another Δq are sold for a slightly lower price of about p2, the
next Δq for a price of about p3, and so on. Thus,
Consumers’ total expenditure ≈p1Δq + p2Δq + p3Δq + · · · =
+
piΔq.
If D is the demand function given by p = D(q), and if all consumers who were willing to pay more
than p∗paid as much as they were willing, then as Δq →0, we would have
Consumer expenditure =
, q∗

D(q)dq = Area under demand
curve from 0 to q∗.
Now if all goods are sold at the equilibrium price, the consumers’ actual expenditure is p∗q∗, the
area of the rectangle between the axes and the lines q = q∗and p = p∗. Thus, if p∗and q∗are
equilibrium price and quantity, the consumer surplus is calculated as follows:

34. In 1980, before the uniﬁcation of Germany in 1990 and
the introduction of the Euro, West Germany made a loan
of 20 billion Deutsche Marks to the Soviet Union, to
be used for the construction of a natural gas pipeline
connecting Siberia to Western Russia, and continuing
to West Germany (Urengoi–Uschgorod–Berlin). Assume
that the deal was as follows: In 1985, upon completion
of the pipeline, the Soviet Union would deliver natu-
ral gas to West Germany, at a constant rate, for all fu-
ture times. Assuming a constant price of natural gas of
0.10 Deutsche Mark per cubic meter, and assuming West
Germany expects 10% annual interest on its investment
(compounded continuously), at what rate does the Soviet
Union have to deliver the gas, in billions of cubic me-
ters per year? Keep in mind that delivery of gas could
not begin until the pipeline was completed. Thus, West
Germany received no return on its investment until after
ﬁve years had passed. (Note: A more complex deal of this
type was actually made between the two countries.)
35. In May 1991, Car and Driver described a Jaguar that sold

straight line, and that $560,000 and 350 are the equilib-
rium price and quantity, ﬁnd the consumer surplus at the

DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS
Understanding the distribution of various quantities through the population is important to decision
makers. For example, the income distribution gives useful information about the economic structure
of a society. In this section we will look at the distribution of ages in the US. To allocate funding for
education, health care, and social security, the government needs to know how many people are in
each age group. We will see how to represent such information by a density function.
US Age Distribution
The data in Table 8.4 shows how the ages of the US population were distributed in 1995. To represent
this information graphically we use a type3 of histogram, putting a vertical bar above each age group
in such a way that the area of each bar represents the fraction of the population in that age group.
The total area of all the rectangles is 100% = 1. We only consider people who are less than 100
years old.4 For the 0–20 age group, the base of the rectangle is 20, and we want the area to be
0.29, so the height must be 0.29/20 = 0.0145. We treat ages as though they were continuously
distributed. The category 0–20, for example, contains people who are just one day short of their
twentieth birthday. (See Figure 8.86.)
3There are other types of histogram which have frequency on the vertical axis.
4In fact, 0.02% of the population is over 100, but this is too small to be visible on the histogram.

Figure 8.86: How ages were distributed in the US in 1995
Example 1
In 1995, estimate what fraction of the US population was:
(a)
Between 20 and 60 years old.
(b)
Less than 10 years old.
(c)
Between 75 and 80 years old.
(d)
Between 80 and 85 years old.
Solution
(a) We add the fractions, so 0.31 + 0.24 = 0.55; that is, 55% of the US population was in this age
group.
(b) To ﬁnd the fraction less than 10 years old, we could assume, for example, that the population
was distributed evenly over the 0–20 group. (This means we are assuming that babies were born
at a fairly constant rate over the last 20 years, which is probably reasonable.) If we make this
assumption, then we can say that the population less than 10 years old was about half that in
the 0–20 group, that is, 0.145 of the total population. Notice that we get the same result by
computing the area of the rectangle from 0 to 10. (See Figure 8.87.)
(c) To ﬁnd the population between 75 and 80 years old, since 0.13 of Americans in 1995 were
in the 60-80 group, we might apply the same reasoning and say that 1
4(0.13) = 0.0325 of
the population was in this age group. This result is represented as an area in Figure 8.87. The
assumption that the population was evenly distributed is not a good one here; certainly there
were more people between the ages of 60 and 65 than between 75 and 80. Thus, the estimate of
0.0325 is certainly too high.
(d) Again using the (faulty) assumption that ages in each group were distributed uniformly, we
would ﬁnd that the fraction between 80 and 85 was 1
4(0.03) = 0.0075. (See Figure 8.87.)
This estimate is also poor—there were certainly more people in the 80–85 group than, say, the
95–100 group, and so the 0.0075 estimate is too low.

Figure 8.88: Smoothing out the age histogram
Smoothing Out the Histogram
We could get better estimates if we had smaller age groups (each age group in Figure 8.86 is 20
years, which is quite large). The more detailed data in Table 8.5 leads to the new histogram in
Figure 8.88. As we get more detailed information, the upper silhouette of the histogram becomes
smoother, but the area of any of the bars still represents the percentage of the population in that age
group. Imagine, in the limit, replacing the upper silhouette of the histogram by a smooth curve in
such a way that area under the curve above one age group is the same as the area in the corresponding
rectangle. The total area under the whole curve is again 100% = 1. (See Figure 8.88.)
The Age Density Function
If t is age in years, we deﬁne p(t), the age density function, to be a function which “smooths out”
the age histogram. This function has the property that
Fraction of population

of all of the population are between a and b, then

What does the age density function p tell us? Notice that we have not talked about the mean-
ing of p(t) itself, but only of the integral
- b
a p(t) dt. Let’s look at this in a bit more detail. Suppose,
for example, that p(10) = 0.015 per year. This is not telling us that 0.015 of the population is pre-

4, not 10.1). However,
p(10) = 0.015 does tell us that for some small interval Δt around 10, the fraction of the population
with ages in this interval is approximately p(10) Δt = 0.015 Δt.
The Probability Density Function
Suppose we are interested in how a certain characteristic, x, is distributed through a population. For
example, x might be height or age if the population is people, or might be wattage for a population
of light bulbs. Then we deﬁne a general density function with the following properties:

8.7 DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS

The function, p(x), is a probability density function, or pdf, if
Fraction of population for which
x is between a and b
=

between a and b
=
, b
a
p(x)dx.
, ∞
−∞
p(x) dx = 1
and
p(x) ≥0
for all x.
The density function must be nonnegative because its integral always gives a fraction of the
population. Also, the fraction of the population with x between −∞and ∞is 1 because the entire
population has the characteristic x between −∞and ∞. The function p that was used to smooth
out the age histogram satisﬁes this deﬁnition of a density function. We do not assign a meaning
to the value p(x) directly, but rather interpret p(x) Δx as the fraction of the population with the
characteristic in a short interval of length Δx around x.
The density function is often approximated by formulas, as in the next example.
Example 2
Find formulas to approximate the density function, p, for the US age distribution. To reﬂect Fig-
ure 8.88, use a continuous function, constant at 0.015 up to age 40 and then dropping linearly.
Solution
We have p(t) = 0.015 for 0 ≤t < 40. For t ≥40, we need a linear function sloping down-
ward. Because p is continuous, we have p(40) = 0.015. Because p is a density function we have
- 100

p(t)dt = 1. Suppose b is as in Figure 8.89; then

- 100

p(t)dt is given by the area of the triangle. This gives
0.015

b = 0.4,
and so
b ≈53.3.
Thus the slope of the line is −0.015/53.3 ≈−0.00028, so for 40 ≤t ≤40+53.3 = 93.3, we have
p(t) −0.015 = −0.00028(t −40),
p(t) = 0.0262 −0.00028t.
According to this way of smoothing the data, there is no one over 93.3 years old, so p(t) = 0 for
t > 93.3.

Cumulative Distribution Function for Ages
Another way of showing how ages are distributed in the US is by using the cumulative distribution
function P(t), deﬁned by
P(t) = Fraction of population
of age less than t
=
, t
0
p(x)dx.
Thus, P is the antiderivative of p with P(0) = 0, and P(t) gives the area under the density curve
between 0 and t.

Chapter Eight USING THE DEFINITE INTEGRAL
Notice that the cumulative distribution function is nonnegative and increasing (or at least non-
decreasing), since the number of people younger than age t increases as t increases. Another way
of seeing this is to notice that P ′ = p, and p is positive (or nonnegative). Thus the cumulative age
distribution is a function which starts with P(0) = 0 and increases as t increases. P(t) = 0 for
t < 0 because, when t < 0, there is no one whose age is less than t. The limiting value of P, as
t →∞, is 1 since as t becomes very large (100 say), everyone is younger than age t, so the fraction
of people with age less than t tends toward 1. (See Figure 8.90.) For t less than 40, the graph of P
is a straight line, because p is constant there. For t > 40, the graph of P levels off as p tends to 0.

Probability
Suppose we pick a member of the US population at random and ask what is the probability that the
person is between, say, the ages of 70 and 80. We saw in Table 8.5 on page 468 that 5% = 0.05 of
the population is in this age group. We say that the probability, or chance, that the person is between
70 and 80 is 0.05. Using any age density function p(t), we can deﬁne probabilities as follows:
Probability that a person is
between ages a and b
=

between ages a and b

Solution
(a) The cumulative distribution function P(t) is equal to the fraction of days on which the catch is
less than t tons of ﬁsh. Since the catch is never less than 2 tons, we have P(t) = 0 for t ≤2.
Since the catch is always less than 8 tons, we have P(t) = 1 for t ≥8. For t in the range
2 < t < 8, we must evaluate the integral
P(t) =

This integral equals the area under the graph of p(x) between x = 2 and x = t. It can be

p(x) =

0.04x
for 2 ≤x ≤6

The Median and Mean
It is often useful to be able to give an “average” value for a distribution. Two measures that are in
common use are the median and the mean.
The Median
A median of a quantity x distributed through a population is a value T such that half the
population has values of x less than (or equal to) T , and half the population has values of x
greater than (or equal to) T . Thus, a median T satisﬁes
, T
−∞
p(x) dx = 0.5,
where p is the density function. In other words, half the area under the graph of p lies to the
left of T .
Example 2
Find the median age in the US in 1995, using the age density function given by
p(t) =

0.015
for 0 ≤t ≤40
0.0262 −0.00028t
for 40 < t ≤93.3.
Solution
We want to ﬁnd the value of T such that

p(t) dt = 0.5.
Since p(t) = 0.015 up to age 40, we have

Figure 8.103: Shaded area is percentage of population with

The Mean
Another commonly used average value is the mean. To ﬁnd the mean of N numbers, you add
the numbers and divide the sum by N. For example, the mean of the numbers 1, 2, 7, and 10 is
(1 + 2 + 7 + 10)/4 = 5. The mean age of the entire US population is therefore deﬁned as
Mean age =
* Ages of all people in the US
Total number of people in the US.
Calculating the sum of all the ages directly would be an enormous task; we will approximate
the sum by an integral. The idea is to “slice up” the age axis and consider the people whose age is
between t and t + Δt. How many are there?
The fraction of the population between t and t + Δt is the area under the graph of p between
these points, which is well approximated by the area of the rectangle, p(t)Δt. (See Figure 8.103.)
If the total number of people in the population is N, then
Number of people with age
between t and t + Δt
≈p(t)ΔtN.
The age of all of these people is approximately t:
Sum of ages of people
between age t and t + Δt
≈tp(t)ΔtN.
Therefore, adding and factoring out an N gives us
Sum of ages of all people ≈
+
tp(t)Δt

N.
In the limit, as we allow Δt to shrink to 0, the sum becomes an integral, so
Sum of ages of all people =

N.
Therefore, with N equal to the total number of people in the US, and assuming no person is over
100 years old,
Mean age = Sum of ages of all people in US

Normal Distributions
How much rain do you expect to fall in your home town this year? If you live in Anchorage, Alaska,
the answer is something close to 15 inches (including the snow). Of course, you don’t expect exactly
15 inches. Some years have more than 15 inches, and some years have less. Most years, however, the
amount of rainfall is close to 15 inches; only rarely is it well above or well below 15 inches. What
does the density function for the rainfall look like? To answer this question, we look at rainfall data
over many years. Records show that the distribution of rainfall is well-approximated by a normal
distribution. The graph of its density function is a bell-shaped curve which peaks at 15 inches and
slopes downward approximately symmetrically on either side.
Normal distributions are frequently used to model real phenomena, from grades on an exam
to the number of airline passengers on a particular ﬂight. A normal distribution is characterized by
its mean, μ, and its standard deviation, σ. The mean tells us the location of the central peak. The
standard deviation tells us how closely the data is clustered around the mean. A small value of σ
tells us that the data is close to the mean; a large σ tells us the data is spread out. In the following
formula for a normal distribution, the factor of 1/(σ
√
2π) makes the area under the graph equal
to 1.

1. Medical Case Study: Flux of Fluid from a Capillary10
The heart pumps blood throughout the body, the arteries are the blood vessels carrying
blood away from the heart, and the veins return blood to the heart. Close to the heart, arteries
are very large. As they progress toward tissues (such as the brain), the arteries branch repeatedly,
getting smaller as they do. The smallest blood vessels are capillaries—microscopic, living tubes
that link the smallest arteries to the smallest veins. The capillary is where nutrients and ﬂuids
move out of the blood into the adjacent tissues and waste products from the tissues move into
the blood. The key to this process is the capillary wall, which is only one cell thick, allowing the
unfettered passage of small molecules, such as water, ions, oxygen, glucose, and amino acids,
while preventing the passage of large components of the blood (such as large proteins and blood
cells).
Precise measurements demonstrate that the ﬂux (rate of ﬂow) of ﬂuid through the capillary
wall is not constant over the length of the capillary. Fluids in and around the capillary are
subjected to two forces. The hydrostatic pressure, resulting from the heart’s pumping, pushes
ﬂuid out of the capillary into the surrounding tissue. The oncotic pressure drives absorption
in the other direction. At the start of a capillary, where the capillary branches off the small
artery, the hydrostatic pressure is high while the oncotic pressure is low. Along the length of
the capillary, the hydrostatic pressure decreases while the oncotic pressure is approximately
constant. See Figure 8.118.
For most capillaries there is a net positive value for ﬂow: more ﬂuid ﬂows from the cap-
illaries into the surrounding tissue than the other way around. This presents a major problem
for maintaining ﬂuid balance in the body. How is the ﬂuid left in the tissues to get back into
circulation? If it cannot, the tissues progressively swell (a condition called edema). Evolution’s
solution is to provide humans and other mammals with a second set of vessels, the lymphatics,
that absorb extra tissue ﬂuid and provide one way routes back to the bloodstream.

Along a cylindrical capillary of length L = 0.1 cm and radius r = 0.0004 cm, the hydro-
static pressure, ph, varies from 35 mm Hg at the artery end to 15 mm Hg at the vein end. (mm

2. Medical Case Study: Testing for Kidney Disease11
Patients with kidney disease often have protein in their urine. While small amounts of
protein are not very worrisome, more than 1 gram of protein excreted in 24 hours warrants
active treatment. The most accurate method for measuring urine protein is to have the patient
collect all his or her urine in a container for a full 24 hour period. The total mass of protein can
then be found by measuring the volume and protein concentration of the urine.
However, this process is not as straightforward as it sounds. Since the urine is collected
intermittently throughout the 24 hour period, the ﬁrst urine voided sits in the container longer
than the last urine voided. During this time, the proteins slowly fall to the bottom of the con-
tainer. Thus, at the end of a 24 hour collection period, there is a higher concentration of protein
on the bottom of the container than at the top.
One could try to mix the urine so that the protein concentration is more uniform, but this
forms bubbles that trap the protein, leading to an underestimate of the total amount excreted. A
better way to determine the total protein is to measure the concentration at the top and at the
bottom, and then calculate the total protein.
(a) Suppose a patient voids 2 litres (2000 ml) of urine in 24 hours and collects it in a cylindrical
container of diameter 10 cm (note that 1 cm3 = 1 ml). A technician determines that the
protein concentration at the top is 0.14 mg/ml, and at the bottom is 0.96 mg/ml. Assume
that the concentration of protein varies linearly from the top to the bottom.
(i) Find a formula for c, the protein concentration in mg/ml, as a function of y, the dis-
tance in centimeters from the base of the cylinder.

(iii) Write an integral that gives the total quantity of protein in the urine sample. Does this

(b) Assuming that concentration changes linearly with height, another way to estimate the
quantity of protein in the sample is to multiply the average of the top and bottom protein
concentrations by the volume of urine collected. Show that this procedure gives the same
answer as integration, no matter what the radius of the cylindrical container, the volume
collected, and the top and bottom protein concentrations.
3. Volume Enclosed by Two Cylinders
Two cylinders are inscribed in a cube of side length 2, as shown in Figure 8.119. What is
the volume of the solid that the two cylinders enclose? [Hint: Use horizontal slices.] Note: The
solution was known to Archimedes. The Chinese mathematician Liu Hui (third century A.D.)
tried to ﬁnd this volume, but he failed; he wrote a poem about his efforts calling the enclosed
volume a “box-lid:”
Look inside the cube
And outside the box-lid;
Though the dimension increases,
It doesn’t quite ﬁt.
The marriage preparations are complete;
But square and circle wrangle,
Thick and thin are treacherous plots,
They are incompatible.

But fear that I will miss the correct principle;
I dare to let the doubtful points stand,

For one who can expound them.

SEQUENCES
A sequence1 is an inﬁnite list of numbers s1, s2, s3, . . . , sn, . . .. We call s1 the ﬁrst term, s2 the
second term; sn is the general term. For example, the sequence of squares, 1, 4, 9, . . ., n2, . . . can
be denoted by the general term sn = n2. Thus, a sequence is a function whose domain is the
positive integers, but it is traditional to denote the terms of a sequence using subscripts, sn, rather
than function notation, s(n). In addition, we may talk about sequences whose general term has no
simple formula, such as the sequence 3, 3.1, 3.14, 3.141, 3.1415, . . ., in which sn gives the ﬁrst n
digits of π.
The Numerical, Algebraic, and Graphical Viewpoint
Just as we can view a function algebraically, numerically, graphically, or verbally, we can view
sequences in different ways. We may give an algebraic formula for the general term. We may give
the numerical values of the ﬁrst few terms of the sequence, suggesting a pattern for the later terms.
Example 1
Give the ﬁrst six terms of the following sequences:
(a)
sn = n(n + 1)
2
(b)
sn = n + (−1)n
n
Solution
(a) Substituting n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 into the formula for the general term, we get

(b)
7
2, 7
5, 7
8, 7
11, 1
2, 7
17, . . .
Solution
Although the ﬁrst six terms do not determine the sequence, we can sometimes use them to guess a
possible formula for the general term.
(a) We have powers of 2, so we guess sn = 2n. When we check by substituting in n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
we get 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, instead of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32. We ﬁx our guess by subtracting 1 from the
exponent, so the general term is
sn = 2n−1.
Substituting the ﬁrst six values of n shows that the formula checks.
(b) In this sequence, the ﬁfth term looks different from the others, whose numerators are all 7. We
can ﬁx this by rewriting 1/2 = 7/14. The sequence of denominators is then 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17.
This looks like a linear function with slope 3, so we expect the denominator has formula 3n+k
for some k. When n = 1, the denominator is 2, so
2 = 3 · 1 + k
giving
k = −1
and the denominator of sn is 3n −1. Our general term is then
sn =
7
3n −1.
To check this, evaluate sn for n = 1, . . . , 6.
There are two ways to visualize a sequence. One is to plot points with n on the horizontal
axis and sn on the vertical axis. The other is to label points on a number line s1, s2, s3, .... See
Figure 9.1 for the sequence sn = 1 + (−1)n/n.
1In everyday English, the words “sequence” and “series” are used interchangeably. In mathematics, they have different
meanings and cannot be interchanged.

Defining Sequences Recursively
Sequences can also be deﬁned recursively, by giving an equation relating the nth term to the previ-
ous terms and as many of the ﬁrst few terms as are needed to get started.
Example 3
Give the ﬁrst six terms of the recursively deﬁned sequences.
(a) sn = sn−1 + 3 for n > 1 and s1 = 4
(b) sn = −3sn−1 for n > 1 and s1 = 2
(c) sn = 1
2(sn−1 + sn−2) for n > 2 and s1 = 0, s2 = 1
(d) sn = nsn−1 for n > 1 and s1 = 1
Solution
(a) When n = 2, we obtain s2 = s1 + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7. When n = 3, we obtain s3 = s2 + 3 =
7 + 3 = 10. In words, we obtain each term by adding 3 to the previous term. The ﬁrst six terms
are
4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19.
(b) Each term is −3 times the previous term, starting with s1 = 2. We have s2 = −3s1 = −3 · 2 =
−6 and s3 = −3s2 = −3(−6) = 18. Continuing, we get
2, −6, 18, −54, 162, −486.
(c) Each term is the average of the previous two terms, starting with s1 = 0 and s2 = 1. We get
s3 = (s2 + s1)/2 = (1 + 0)/2 = 1/2. Then s4 = (s3 + s2)/2 = ((1/2) + 1)/2 = 3/4.
Continuing, we get
0, 1, 1
2, 3
4, 5
8, 11
16.
(d) Here s2 = 2s1 = 2 · 1 = 2 so s3 = 3s2 = 3 · 2 = 6 and s4 = 4s3 = 4 · 6 = 24. Continuing
gives
1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720.
The general term of part (d) of the previous example is given by sn = n(n−1)(n−2) . . .3·2·1,
which is denoted sn = n! and is called n factorial. We deﬁne 0! = 1.
We can also look at the ﬁrst few terms of a sequence and try to guess a recursive deﬁnition by
looking for a pattern.
Example 4
Give a recursive deﬁnition of the following sequences.
(a)
1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, . . .
(b)
1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, . . .
Solution
(a) Each term is twice the previous term plus one; for example 7 = 2 · 3 + 1 and 63 = 2 · 31 + 1.
Thus, a recursive deﬁnition is
sn = 2sn−1 + 1 for n > 1 and s1 = 1.
There are other ways to deﬁne the sequence recursively. We might notice, for example, that the
differences of consecutive terms are powers of 2. Thus, we could also use
sn = sn−1 + 2n−1
for n > 1 and s1 = 1.

494
Chapter Nine SEQUENCES AND SERIES
(b) We recognize the terms as the squares of the positive integers, but we are looking for a recursive
deﬁnition which relates consecutive terms. We see that
s2 = s1 + 3
s3 = s2 + 5
s4 = s3 + 7
s5 = s4 + 9,
so the differences between consecutive terms are consecutive odd integers. The difference be-
tween sn and sn−1 is 2n −1, so a recursive deﬁnition is
sn = sn−1 + 2n −1, for n > 1 and s1 = 1.
Recursively deﬁned sequences, sometimes called recurrence relations, are powerful tools used
frequently in computer science, as well as in differential equations. Finding a formula for the general
term can be surprisingly difﬁcult.
Convergence of Sequences
The limit of a sequence sn as n →∞is deﬁned the same way as the limit of a function f(x) as
x →∞; see also Problem 61.
The sequence s1, s2, s3, . . . , sn, . . . has a limit L, written lim
n→∞sn = L, if sn is as close to
L as we please whenever n is sufﬁciently large. If a limit, L, exists, we say the sequence
converges to its limit L. If no limit exists, we say the sequence diverges.
To calculate the limit of a sequence, we use what we know about the limits of functions, in-
cluding the properties in Theorem 1.2 and the following facts:
• The sequence sn = xn converges to 0 if |x| < 1 and diverges if |x| > 1
• The sequence sn = 1/np converges to 0 if p > 0
Example 5
Do the following sequences converge or diverge? If a sequence converges, ﬁnd its limit.
(a)
sn = (0.8)n
(b)
sn = 1 −e−n
1 + e−n
(c)
sn = n2 + 1
n
(d)
sn = 1 + (−1)n
Solution
(a) Since 0.8 < 1, the sequence converges by the ﬁrst fact and the limit is 0.
(b) Since e−1 < 1, we have lim
n→∞e−n =
lim
n→∞(e−1)n = 0 by the ﬁrst fact. Thus, using the
properties of limits from Section 1.8, we have
lim
n→∞
1 −e−n
1 + e−n = 1 −0
1 + 0 = 1.
(c) Since (n2 + 1)/n grows without bound as n →∞, the sequence sn diverges.
(d) Since (−1)n alternates in sign, the sequence alternates between 0 and 2. Thus the sequence sn
diverges, since it does not get close to any ﬁxed value.
Convergence and Bounded Sequences
A sequence sn is bounded if there are numbers K and M such that K ≤sn ≤M for all terms. If
lim
n→∞sn = L, then from some point on, the terms are bounded between L −1 and L + 1. Thus we
have the following fact:
A convergent sequence is bounded.

9.1 SEQUENCES
495
On the other hand, a bounded sequence need not be convergent. In Example 5, we saw that
1+(−1)n diverges, but it is bounded between 0 and 2. To ensure that a bounded sequence converges
we need to rule out this sort of oscillation. The following theorem gives a condition that ensures
convergence for a bounded sequence. A sequence sn is called monotone if it is either increasing,
that is sn < sn+1 for all n, or decreasing, that is sn > sn+1 for all n.
Theorem 9.1: Convergence of a Monotone, Bounded Sequence
If a sequence sn is bounded and monotone, it converges.
To understand this theorem graphically, see Figure 9.2. The sequence sn is increasing and
bounded above by M, so the values of sn must “pile up” at some number less than or equal to M.
This number is the limit.2

Example 6
The sequence sn = (1/2)n is decreasing and bounded below by 0, so it converges. We have already
seen that it converges to 0.
Example 7
The sequence sn = (1 + 1/n)n can be shown to be increasing and bounded (see Project 2 on
page 534). Theorem 9.1 then guarantees that this sequence has a limit, which turns out to be e. (In
fact, the sequence can be used to deﬁne e.)
Example 8
If sn = (1 + 1/n)n, ﬁnd s100 and s1000. How many decimal places agree with e?
Solution
We have s100 = (1.01)100 = 2.7048 and s1000 = (1.001)1000 = 2.7169. Since e = 2.7183 . . .,we
see that s100 agrees with e to one decimal place and s1000 agrees with e to two decimal places.

GEOMETRIC SERIES
Adding the terms of a sequence produces a series. For example, we have the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, . . .
and the series 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + · · ·. This section introduces inﬁnite series of constants, which
are sums of the form
1 + 1
2 + 1
3 + 1
4 + · · ·
0.4 + 0.04 + 0.004 + 0.0004 + · · · .
The individual numbers, 1, 1
2, 1
3, . . . , or 0.4, 0.04, . . ., etc., are called terms in the series. To talk
about the sum of the series, we must ﬁrst explain how to add inﬁnitely many numbers.
Let us look at the repeated administration of a drug. In this example, the terms in the series
represent each dose; the sum of the series represents the drug level in the body in the long run.
Repeated Drug Dosage
A person with an ear infection is told to take antibiotic tablets regularly for several days. Since the
drug is being excreted by the body between doses, how can we calculate the quantity of the drug
remaining in the body at any particular time?
To be speciﬁc, let’s suppose the drug is ampicillin (a common antibiotic) taken in 250 mg doses
four times a day (that is, every six hours). It is known that at the end of six hours, about 4% of the
drug is still in the body. What quantity of the drug is in the body right after the tenth tablet? The
fortieth?
Let Qn represent the quantity, in milligrams, of ampicillin in the blood right after the nth tablet.

Looking at the pattern that is emerging, we guess that
Q10 = 250(0.04)9 + 250(0.04)8 + 250(0.04)7 + · · · + 250(0.04)2 + 250(0.04) + 250.
Notice that there are 10 terms in this sum—one for every tablet—but that the highest power of
0.04 is the ninth, because no tablet has been in the body for more than 9 six-hour time periods.
Now suppose we actually want to ﬁnd the numerical value of Q10. It seems that we have to add 10
terms—fortunately, there’s a better way. Notice the remarkable fact that if you subtract (0.04)Q10
from Q10, all but two terms drop out. First, multiplying by 0.04, we get
(0.04)Q10 = 250(0.04)10+250(0.04)9+250(0.04)8+· · ·+250(0.04)3+250(0.04)2+250(0.04).
Subtracting gives
Q10 −(0.04)Q10 = 250 −250(0.04)10.
Factoring Q10 on the left and solving for Q10 gives
Q10(1 −0.04) = 250

1 −(0.04)10
Q10 = 250

1 −(0.04)10
1 −0.04
.
This is called the closed-form expression for Q10. It is easy to evaluate on a calculator, giving
Q10 = 260.42 (to two decimal places). Similarly, Q40 is given in closed form by
Q40 = 250

1 −(0.04)40
1 −0.04
.
Evaluating this on a calculator shows Q40 = 260.42, which is the same (to two decimal places) as
Q10. Thus after ten tablets, the value of Qn appears to have stabilized at just over 260 mg.
Looking at the closed forms for Q10 and Q40, we can see that, in general, Qn must be given by
Qn = 250 (1 −(0.04)n)
1 −0.04
.
What Happens as n →∞?
What does this closed form for Qn predict about the long-run level of ampicillin in the body? As
n →∞, the quantity (0.04)n →0. In the long run, assuming that 250 mg continue to be taken
every six hours, the level right after a tablet is taken is given by
Qn = 250 (1 −(0.04)n)
1 −0.04
→250(1 −0)
1 −0.04
= 260.42.

Chapter Nine SEQUENCES AND SERIES
The Geometric Series in General
In the previous example we encountered sums of the form a + ax + ax2 + · · · + ax8 + ax9 (with
a = 250 and x = 0.04). Such a sum is called a ﬁnite geometric series. A geometric series is one
in which each term is a constant multiple of the one before. The ﬁrst term is a, and the constant
multiplier, or common ratio of successive terms, is x.
A ﬁnite geometric series has the form
a + ax + ax2 + · · · + axn−2 + axn−1.
An inﬁnite geometric series has the form
a + ax + ax2 + · · · + axn−2 + axn−1 + axn + · · · .
The “· · ·” at the end of the second series tells us that the series is going on forever—in other words,
that it is inﬁnite.
Sum of a Finite Geometric Series
The same procedure that enabled us to ﬁnd the closed form for Q10 can be used to ﬁnd the sum of
any ﬁnite geometric series. Suppose we write Sn for the sum of the ﬁrst n terms, which means up
to the term containing xn−1:
Sn = a + ax + ax2 + · · · + axn−2 + axn−1.
Multiply Sn by x:
xSn = ax + ax2 + ax3 + · · · + axn−1 + axn.
Now subtract xSn from Sn, which cancels out all terms except for two, giving
Sn −xSn = a −axn
(1 −x)Sn = a(1 −xn).
Provided x ̸= 1, we can solve to ﬁnd a closed form for Sn as follows:
The sum of a ﬁnite geometric series is given by
Sn = a + ax + ax2 + · · · + axn−1 = a(1 −xn)
1 −x
,
provided x ̸= 1.
Note that the value of n in the formula for Sn is the number of terms in the sum Sn.
Sum of an Infinite Geometric Series
In the ampicillin example, we found the sum Qn and then let n →∞. We do the same here. The
sum Qn, which shows the effect of the ﬁrst n doses, is an example of a partial sum. The ﬁrst three
partial sums of the series a + ax + ax2 + · · · + axn−1 + axn + · · · are
S1 = a
S2 = a + ax
S3 = a + ax + ax2.
To ﬁnd the sum of this inﬁnite series, we consider the partial sum, Sn, of the ﬁrst n terms. The
formula for the sum of a ﬁnite geometric series gives
Sn = a + ax + ax2 + · · · + axn−1 = a(1 −xn)
1 −x
.

9.2 GEOMETRIC SERIES
501
What happens to Sn as n →∞? It depends on the value of x. If |x| < 1, then xn →0 as n →∞,
so
lim
n→∞Sn = lim
n→∞
a(1 −xn)
1 −x
= a(1 −0)
1 −x
=
a
1 −x.
Thus, provided |x| < 1, as n →∞the partial sums Sn approach a limit of a/(1 −x). When this
happens, we deﬁne the sum S of the inﬁnite geometric series to be that limit and say the series
converges to a/(1 −x).
For |x| < 1, the sum of the inﬁnite geometric series is given by
S = a + ax + ax2 + · · · + axn−1 + axn + · · · =
a
1 −x.
If, on the other hand, |x| > 1, then xn and the partial sums have no limit as n →∞(if a ̸= 0).
In this case, we say the series diverges. If x > 1, the terms in the series become larger and larger in
magnitude, and the partial sums diverge to +∞(if a > 0) or −∞(if a < 0). When x < −1, the
terms become larger in magnitude, the partial sums oscillate as n →∞, and the series diverges.
What happens when x = 1? The series is
a + a + a + a + · · · ,
and if a ̸= 0, the partial sums grow without bound, and the series does not converge. When x = −1,
the series is
a −a + a −a + a −· · · ,
and, if a ̸= 0, the partial sums oscillate between a and 0, and the series does not converge.

Chapter Nine SEQUENCES AND SERIES
S1 = 1
S2 = 1 + 2 = 3
S3 = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7
S4 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15.
The sequence of partial sums begins
1, 3, 7, 15, . . ..
The formula for Sn gives
Sn = 1 −2n
1 −2 = 2n −1.
(c) This is an inﬁnite geometric series with a = 6 and x = −1
3. The partial sums,
S1 = 6.00,
S2 = 4.00,
S3 ≈4.67,
S4 ≈4.44,
S5 ≈4.52,
S6 ≈4.49,
appear to be converging to 4.5. This turns out to be correct because the sum is
S =

1 −(−1/3) = 4.5.
Regular Deposits into a Savings Account
People who save money often do so by putting some ﬁxed amount aside regularly. To be speciﬁc,
suppose $1000 is deposited every year in a savings account earning 5% a year, compounded annu-
ally. What is the balance, Bn, in dollars, in the savings account right after the nth deposit?
As before, let’s start by looking at the ﬁrst few years:
B1 = 1000
B2 = B1(1.05) + 1000 = 1000(1.05)


	
Original deposit
+
1000
	
New deposit
B3 = B2(1.05) + 1000 = 1000(1.05)2 + 1000(1.05)


	
First two deposits
+
1000
	
New deposit
Observing the pattern, we see
Bn = 1000(1.05)n−1 + 1000(1.05)n−2 + · · · + 1000(1.05) + 1000.
So Bn is a ﬁnite geometric series with a = 1000 and x = 1.05. Thus we have
Bn = 1000 (1 −(1.05)n)
1 −1.05
.
We can rewrite this so that both the numerator and denominator of the fraction are positive:
Bn = 1000 ((1.05)n −1)
1.05 −1
.
What Happens as n →∞?
Common sense tells you that if you keep depositing $1000 in an account and it keeps earning
interest, your balance grows without bound. This is what the formula for Bn shows also: (1.05)n →
∞as n →∞, so Bn has no limit. (Alternatively, observe that the inﬁnite geometric series of which
Bn is a partial sum has x = 1.05, which is greater than 1, so the series does not converge.)

Problems
32. This problem shows another way of deriving the long-run
ampicillin level. (See page 498.) In the long run the ampi-
cillin levels off to Q mg right after each tablet is taken.
Six hours later, right before the next dose, there will be
less ampicillin in the body. However, if stability has been
reached, the amount of ampicillin that has been excreted
is exactly 250 mg because taking one more tablet raises
the level back to Q mg. Use this to solve for Q.
33. On page 499, you saw how to compute the quantity Qn
mg of ampicillin in the body right after the nth tablet of
250 mg, taken once every six hours.
(a) Do a similar calculation for Pn, the quantity of
ampicillin (in mg) in the body right before the nth
tablet is taken.

were made into a bank account earning 4% a year, com-
pounded annually.

42. In theory, drugs that decay exponentially always leave a
residue in the body. However, in practice, once the drug
has been in the body for 5 half-lives, it is regarded as

the amount of drug that can be in the body?
43. This problem shows how to estimate the cumulative ef-
fect of a tax cut on a country’s economy. Suppose the
government proposes a tax cut totaling $100 million. We
assume that all the people who have extra money spend
80% of it and save 20%. Thus, of the extra income gen-
erated by the tax cut, $100(0.8) million = $80 mil-
lion is spent and becomes extra income to someone else.
These people also spend 80% of their additional income,
or $80(0.8) million, and so on. Calculate the total addi-
tional spending created by such a tax cut.
44. (a) What is the present value of a $1000 bond which
pays $50 a year for 10 years, starting one year from
now? Assume the interest rate is 5% per year, com-
pounded annually.
(b) Since $50 is 5% of $1000, this bond is called a 5%
bond. What does your answer to part (a) tell you
about the relationship between the principal and the
present value of this bond if the interest rate is 5%?
(c) If the interest rate is more than 5% per year, com-
pounded annually, which is larger: the principal or
the present value of the bond? Why is the bond then
described as trading at a discount?
(d) If the interest rate is less than 5% per year, com-
pounded annually, why is the bond described as
trading at a premium?
45. The government proposes a tax cut of $100 million as in
Problem 43, but that economists now predict that people
will spend 90% of their extra income and save only 10%.
How much additional spending would be generated by
the tax cut under these assumptions?
46. A ball is dropped from a height of 10 feet and bounces.
Each bounce is
3
4 of the height of the bounce before.
Thus, after the ball hits the ﬂoor for the ﬁrst time, the
ball rises to a height of 10( 3
4) = 7.5 feet, and after it
hits the ﬂoor for the second time, it rises to a height of
7.5( 3
4) = 10( 3
4)2 = 5.625 feet. (Assume that there is no
air resistance.)
(a) Find an expression for the height to which the ball
rises after it hits the ﬂoor for the nth time.
(b) Find an expression for the total vertical distance the
ball has traveled when it hits the ﬂoor for the ﬁrst,
second, third, and fourth times.
(c) Find an expression for the total vertical distance the
ball has traveled when it hits the ﬂoor for the nth
time. Express your answer in closed form.
47. You might think that the ball in Problem 46 keeps bounc-
ing forever since it takes inﬁnitely many bounces. This is

CONVERGENCE OF SERIES
We now consider general series in which each term an is a number. The series can be written
compactly using a
+
sign as follows:
∞
+
n=1
an = a1 + a2 + a3 + · · · + an + · · · .
For any values of a and x, the geometric series is such a series, with general term an = axn−1.
Partial Sums and Convergence of Series
As in Section 9.2, we deﬁne the partial sum, Sn, of the ﬁrst n terms of a series as
Sn =
n
+
i=1
ai = a1 + a2 + · · · + an.
To investigate the convergence of the series, we consider the sequence of partial sums
S1, S2, S3, . . . , Sn, . . . .
If Sn has a limit as n →∞, then we deﬁne the sum of the series to be that limit.
If the sequence Sn of partial sums converges to S, so lim
n→∞Sn = S, then we say the series
∞
+
n=1
an converges and that its sum is S. We write
∞
+
n=1
an = S. If lim
n→∞Sn does not exist, we
say that the series diverges.
The following example shows how a series leads to sequence of partial sums and how we use
them to determine convergence.
Example 1
Investigate the convergence of the series with an = 1/(n(n + 1)):

Chapter Nine SEQUENCES AND SERIES
Solution
In order to determine whether the series converges, we ﬁrst ﬁnd the partial sums:
S1 = 1
2
S2 = 1
2 + 1
6 = 2
3
S3 = 1
2 + 1
6 + 1
12 = 3
4
S4 = 1
2 + 1
6 + 1
12 + 1
20 = 4
5
...
It appears that Sn = n/(n + 1) for each positive integer n. We check that this pattern continues by
assuming that Sn = n/(n + 1) for a given integer n, adding an+1, and simplifying
Sn+1 = Sn + an+1 =
n
n + 1 +
1
(n + 1)(n + 2) =
n2 + 2n + 1
(n + 1)(n + 2) = n + 1
n + 2.
Thus the sequence of partial sums has formula Sn = n/(n + 1), which converges to 1, so the series
*∞
n=1 an converges to 1. That is, we can say that
1
2 + 1
6 + 1

20 + · · · = 1.
Visualizing Series
We can visualize the terms of the series in Example 1 as the heights of the bars in Figure 9.4. The

Here are some properties that are useful in determining whether or not a series converges.

Theorem 9.2: Convergence Properties of Series
1. If
∞

•

2. Changing a ﬁnite number of terms in a series does not change whether or not it converges,
although it may change the value of its sum if it does converge.
3. If lim
n→∞an ̸= 0 or lim
n→∞an does not exist, then
∞
+
n=1
an diverges.
4. If
∞
+
n=1
an diverges, then
∞
+
n=1
kan diverges if k ̸= 0.
For proofs of these properties, see Problems 39–42. As for improper integrals, the convergence
of a series is determined by its behavior for large n. (See the “behaves like” principle on page 404.)
From Property 2 we see that, if N is a positive integer, then *∞
n=1 an and *∞
n=N an either both
converge or both diverge. Thus, if all we care about is the convergence of a series, we can omit the
limits and write * an.
Example 2
Does the series
+
(1 −e−n) converge?
Solution
Since the terms in the series an = 1 −e−n tend to 1, not 0, as n →∞, the series diverges by
Property 3 of Theorem 9.2.
Comparison of Series and Integrals
We investigate the convergence of some series by comparison with an improper integral. The har-
monic series is the inﬁnite series
∞
+
n=1

n = 1 + 1
2 + 1
3 + 1

Convergence of this sum would mean that the sequence of partial sums

3,

Sn = 1 + 1

tends to a limit as n →∞. Let’s look at some values:
S1 = 1,
S10 ≈2.93,
S100 ≈5.19,
S1000 ≈7.49,
S10000 ≈9.79.
The growth of these partial sums is slow, but they do in fact grow without bound, so the harmonic
series diverges. This is justiﬁed in the following example and in Problem 46.
Example 3
Show that the harmonic series 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + · · · diverges.
Solution
The idea is to approximate
- ∞
1 (1/x) dx by a left-hand sum, where the terms 1, 1/2, 1/3, . . . are
heights of rectangles of base 1. In Figure 9.6, the sum of the areas of the 3 rectangles is larger than
the area under the curve between x = 1 and x = 4, and the same kind of relationship holds for the
ﬁrst n rectangles. Thus, we have

x dx = ln(n + 1).
Since ln(n + 1) gets arbitrarily large as n →∞, so do the partial sums, Sn. Thus, the partial sums
have no limit, so the series diverges.

Notice that the harmonic series diverges, even though lim
n→∞an = lim
n→∞(1/n) = 0. Although
Property 3 of Theorem 9.2 guarantees * an diverges if lim
n→∞an ̸= 0, it is possible for * an to
either converge or diverge if lim
n→∞an = 0. When we have lim
n→∞an = 0, we must investigate the
series further to determine whether it converges or diverges.

- ∞
1 (1/x2) dx, show that the following series converges:

n=1
1

4 + 1
9 + · · · .
Solution
Since we want to show that
∞
+
n=1
1/n2 converges, we want to show that the partial sums of this series
tend to a limit. We do this by showing that the sequence of partial sums increases and is bounded
above, so Theorem 9.1 applies.
Each successive partial sum is obtained from the previous one by adding one more term in the
series. Since all the terms are positive, the sequence of partial sums is increasing.
To show that the partial sums of
∞
+
n=1
1/n2 are bounded, we consider the right-hand sum repre-
sented by the area of the rectangles in Figure 9.7. We start at x = 1, since the area under the curve
is inﬁnite for 0 ≤x ≤1. The shaded rectangles in Figure 9.7 suggest that:

Thus, the sequence of partial sums is bounded above by 2. Hence, by Theorem 9.1 the sequence of
partial sums converges, so the series converges.
Notice that we have shown that the series in the Example 4 converges, but we have not found
its sum. The integral gives us a bound on the partial sums, but it does not give us the limit of the
partial sums. Euler proved the remarkable fact that the sum is π2/6.
The method of Examples 3 and 4 can be used to prove the following theorem. See Problem 45.
Theorem 9.3: The Integral Test
Suppose an = f(n), where f(x) is decreasing and positive.
• If
, ∞
1
f(x) dx converges, then * an converges.
• If
, ∞

f(x) dx diverges, then * an diverges.
Suppose f(x) is continuous. Then if f(x) is positive and decreasing for all x beyond some
point, say c, the integral test can be used.
The integral test allows us to analyze a family of series, the p-series, and see how convergence
depends on the parameter p.

If p ≤0, the terms in the series an = 1/np do not tend to 0 as n →∞. Thus the series diverges for
p ≤0.
If p > 0, we compare
∞
+
n=1
1/np to the integral
- ∞
1
1/xp dx. In Example 3 of Section 7.6 we
saw that the integral converges if p > 1 and diverges if p ≤1. By the integral test, we conclude that
* 1/np converges if p > 1 and diverges if p ≤1.
We can summarize Example 5 as follows:

TESTS FOR CONVERGENCE
Comparison of Series
In Section 7.7, we compared two integrals to decide whether an improper integral converged. In
Theorem 9.3 we compared an integral and a series. Now we compare two series.
Theorem 9.4: Comparison Test
Suppose 0 ≤an ≤bn for all n beyond a certain value.
• If * bn converges, then * an converges.
• If * an diverges, then * bn diverges.
Since an ≤bn, the plot of the an terms lies under the plot of the bn terms. (See Figure 9.8.)
The comparison test says that if the total area for * bn is ﬁnite, then the total area for * an is ﬁnite
also. If the total area for * an is not ﬁnite, then neither is the total area for * bn.

Example 1
Use the comparison test to determine whether the series
∞
+
n=1
1
n3 + 1 converges.
Solution
For n ≥1, we know that n3 ≤n3 + 1, so
0 ≤
1
n3 + 1 ≤1
n3 .
Thus, every term in the series *∞
n=1 1/(n3 + 1) is less than or equal to the corresponding term
in *∞
n=1 1/n3. Since we saw that *∞
n=1 1/n3 converges as a p-series with p > 1, we know that
*∞
n=1 1/(n3 + 1) converges.
Example 2
Decide whether the following series converge: (a)
∞
+
n=1
n −1
n3 + 3
(b)
∞
+
n=1
6n2 + 1
2n3 −1.
Solution
(a) Since the convergence is determined by the behavior of the terms for large n, we observe that
n −1
n3 + 3
behaves like
n
n3 = 1
n2
as
n →∞.
Since * 1/n2 converges, we guess that *(n −1)/(n3 + 3) converges. To conﬁrm this, we use
the comparison test. Since a fraction increases if its numerator is made larger or its denominator
is made smaller, we have
0 ≤n −1
n3 + 3 ≤n
n3 = 1
n2
for all
n ≥1.
Thus, the series *(n −1)/(n3 + 3) converges by comparison with * 1/n2.
(b) First, we observe that
6n2 + 1
2n3 −1
behaves like
6n2
2n3 = 3
n
as
n →∞.
Since * 1/n diverges, so does * 3/n, and we guess that *(6n2 + 1)/(2n3 −1) diverges. To
conﬁrm this, we use the comparison test. Since a fraction decreases if its numerator is made
smaller or its denominator is made larger, we have
0 ≤6n2
2n3 ≤6n2 + 1
2n3 −1,
so
0 ≤3
n ≤6n2 + 1
2n3 −1.
Thus, the series *(6n2 + 1)/(2n3 −1) diverges by comparison with * 3/n.
Limit Comparison Test
The comparison test uses the relationship between the terms of two series, an ≤bn, which can

514
Chapter Nine SEQUENCES AND SERIES
be difﬁcult to establish. However, the convergence or divergence of a series depends only on the
long-run behavior of the terms as n →∞; this idea leads to the limit comparison test.
Example 3
Predict the convergence or divergence of
+
n2 −5
n3 + n + 2.
Solution
As n →∞, the highest power terms in the numerator and denominator, n2 and n3, dominate. Thus
the term
an =
n2 −5
n3 + n + 2
behaves, as n →∞, like
n2
n3 = 1
n.
Since the harmonic series * 1/n diverges, we guess that * an also diverges. However, the inequal-
ity
n2 −5
n3 + n + 2 ≤1
n
is in the wrong direction to use with the comparison test to conﬁrm divergence, since we need the
given series to be greater than a known divergent series.
The following test can be used to conﬁrm a prediction of convergence or divergence, as in
Example 3, without inequalities.
Theorem 9.5: Limit Comparison Test
Suppose an > 0 and bn > 0 for all n. If
lim
n→∞
an
bn
= c
where c > 0,
then the two series * an and * bn either both converge or both diverge.
The limit limn→∞an/bn = c captures the idea that an “behaves like” cbn as n →∞.
Example 4
Use the limit comparison test to determine if the following series converge or diverge.
(a)
+
n2 −5
n3 + n + 2
(b)
+

 1
n

Solution
(a) We take an =
n2 −5
n3 + n + 2. Because an behaves like n2
n3 = 1
n as n →∞we take bn = 1/n.
We have
lim
n→∞
an
bn
= lim
n→∞
1
1/n ·
n2 −5
n3 + n + 2 = lim
n→∞
n3 −5n
n3 + n + 2 = 1.
The limit comparison test applies with c = 1. Since * 1/n diverges, the limit comparison test
shows that
+
n2 −5
n3 + n + 2 also diverges.
(b) Since sin x ≈x for x near 0, we know that sin (1/n) behaves like 1/n as n →∞. We apply
the limit comparison test with an = sin (1/n) and bn = 1/n. We have
lim
n→∞
an
bn
= lim
n→∞
sin (1/n)
1/n
= 1.
Thus c = 1 and since * 1/n diverges, the series * sin (1/n) also diverges.

Series of Both Positive and Negative Terms
If * an has both positive and negative terms, then its plot has rectangles lying both above and
below the horizontal axis. See Figure 9.9. The total area of the rectangles is no longer equal to
* an. However, it is still true that if the total area of the rectangles above and below the axis is
ﬁnite, then the series converges. The area of the nth rectangle is |an|, so we have:
Theorem 9.6: Convergence of Absolute Values Implies Convergence
If * |an| converges, then so does * an.
Problem 93 shows how to prove this result.

n2 .
The p-series * 1/n2 converges, since p > 1, so * (−1)n−1 /n2 converges.
Comparison with a Geometric Series: The Ratio Test
A geometric series * an has the property that the ratio an+1/an is constant for all n. For many other
series, this ratio, although not constant, tends to a constant as n increases. In some ways, such series
behave like geometric series. In particular, a geometric series converges if the ratio |an+1/an| < 1.
A non-geometric series also converges if the ratio |an+1/an| tends to a limit which is less than 1.
This idea leads to the following test.
Theorem 9.7: The Ratio Test
For a series * an, suppose the sequence of ratios |an+1|/|an| has a limit:
lim
n→∞
|an+1|
|an|
= L.
• If L < 1, then * an converges.
• If L > 1, or if L is inﬁnite,7 then * an diverges.
• If L = 1, the test does not tell us anything about the convergence of * an.
7That is, the sequence |an+1|/|an| grows without bound.

516
Chapter Nine SEQUENCES AND SERIES
Proof Here are the main steps in the proof. Suppose lim
n→∞
|an+1|
|an|
= L < 1. Let x be a number between L
and 1. Then for all sufﬁciently large n, say for all n ≥k, we have
|an+1|
|an|
< x.
Then,
|ak+1| < |ak|x,
|ak+2| < |ak+1|x < |ak|x2,
|ak+3| < |ak+2|x < |ak|x3,
and so on. Thus, writing a = |ak|, we have for i = 1, 2, 3, . . .,
|ak+i| < axi.
Now we can use the comparison test: * |ak+i| converges by comparison with the geometric series
* axi. Since * |ak+i| converges, Theorem 9.6 tells us that * ak+i converges. So, by property 2
of Theorem 9.2, we see that * an converges too.
If L > 1, then for sufﬁciently large n, say n ≥m,
|an+1| > |an|,
so the sequence |am|, |am+1|, |am+2|, . . ., is increasing. Thus, lim
n→∞an ̸= 0, so * an diverges (by
Theorem 9.2, property 3). The argument in the case that |an+1|/|an| is unbounded is similar.
Example 6
Show that the following series converges:
∞
+
n=1
1
n! = 1 + 1
2! + 1
3! + · · · .
Solution
Since an = 1/n! and an+1 = 1/ (n + 1)!, we have
|an+1|
|an|
= 1/(n + 1)!
1/n!
=
n!
(n + 1)! = n(n −1)(n −2) · · · 2 · 1
(n + 1)n(n −1) · · · 2 · 1.
We cancel n(n −1)(n −2) · · · · · 2 · 1, giving
lim
n→∞
|an+1|
|an|
= lim
n→∞
n!
(n + 1)! = lim
n→∞
1
n + 1 = 0.
Because the limit is 0, which is less than 1, the ratio test tells us that
∞
+
n=1
1/n! converges. In Chap-
ter 10, we see that the sum is e −1.
Example 7
What does the ratio test tell us about the convergence of the following two series?
∞
+
n=1
1
n
and
∞
+
n=1
(−1)n−1
n
.
Solution
Because |(−1)n| = 1, in both cases we have limn→∞|an+1/an| = limn→∞n/(n + 1) = 1. The
ﬁrst series is the harmonic series, which diverges. However, Example 8 will show that the second
series converges. Thus, if the ratio test gives a limit of 1, the ratio test does not tell us anything about
the convergence of a series.

The convergence of an alternating series can often be determined using the following test:
Theorem 9.8: Alternating Series Test
An alternating series of the form
∞
+
n=1
(−1)n−1an = a1 −a2 + a3 −a4 + · · · + (−1)n−1an + · · ·
converges if
0 < an+1 < an
for all n
and
lim
n→∞an = 0.
Although we do not prove this result, we can see why it is reasonable. The ﬁrst partial sum,
S1 = a1, is positive. The second, S2 = a1 −a2, is still positive, since a2 < a1, but S2 is smaller
than S1. (See Figure 9.10.) The next sum, S3 = a1 −a2 + a3, is greater than S2 but smaller than
S1. The partial sums oscillate back and forth, and since the distance between them tends to 0, they
eventually converge.

Example 8
Show that the following alternating harmonic series converges:

(−1)n−1

.
Solution
We have an = 1/n and an+1 = 1/(n + 1). Thus,
an+1 =
1
n + 1 < 1
n = an
for all n,
and
lim
n→∞1/n = 0.
Thus, the hypothesis of Theorem 9.8 is satisﬁed, so the alternating harmonic series converges.
Suppose S is the sum of an alternating series, so S = limn→∞Sn. Then S is trapped between
any two consecutive partial sums, say S3 and S4 or S4 and S5, so
S2 < S4 < · · · < S < · · · < S3 < S1.
Thus, the error in using Sn to approximate the true sum S is less than the distance from Sn to Sn+1,
which is an+1. Stated symbolically, we have the following result:

Chapter Nine SEQUENCES AND SERIES
Theorem 9.9: Error Bounds for Alternating Series
Let Sn =
n
+
i=1
(−1)i−1ai be the nth partial sum of an alternating series and let S = lim
n→∞Sn.
Suppose that 0 < an+1 < an for all n and limn→∞an = 0. Then
|S −Sn| < an+1.
Thus, provided Sn converges to S by the alternating series test, the error in using Sn to approxi-
mate S is less than the magnitude of the ﬁrst term of the series which is omitted in the approximation.
Example 9
Estimate the error in approximating the sum of the alternating harmonic series

+

(−1)n−1/n by
the sum of the ﬁrst nine terms.
Solution
The ninth partial sum is given by
S9 = 1 −1
2 + 1
3 −· · · + 1
9 = 0.7456 . . ..
The ﬁrst term omitted is −1/10, with magnitude 0.1. By Theorem 9.9, we know that the true value
of the sum differs from 0.7456 . . . by less than 0.1.
Absolute and Conditional Convergence
We say that the series
+
an is
• Absolutely convergent if * an and * |an| both converge.
• Conditionally convergent if * an converges but * |an| diverges.
Conditionally convergent series rely on cancellation between positive and negative terms for their
convergence.
Example: The series
∞
+
n=1
(−1)n−1
n2
is absolutely convergent because the series converges and
the p-series * 1/n2 also converges.
Example: The series
∞
+
n=1
(−1)n−1
n
is conditionally convergent because the series converges but
the harmonic series * 1/n diverges.

POWER SERIES AND INTERVAL OF CONVERGENCE
In Section 9.2 we saw that the geometric series * axn converges for −1 < x < 1 and diverges
otherwise. This section studies the convergence of more general series constructed from powers.
Chapter 10 shows how such power series are used to approximate functions such as ex, sin x, cos x,
and ln x.
A power series about x = a is a sum of constants times powers of (x −a):
C0 + C1(x −a) + C2(x −a)2 + · · · + Cn(x −a)n + · · · =
∞
+
n=0
Cn(x −a)n.

522
Chapter Nine SEQUENCES AND SERIES
We think of a as a constant. For any ﬁxed x, the power series * Cn(x −a)n is a series of
numbers like those considered in Section 9.3. To investigate the convergence of a power series, we
consider the partial sums, which in this case are the polynomials Sn(x) = C0 +C1(x−a)+C2(x−
a)2 + · · · + Cn(x −a)n. As before, we consider the sequence8
S0(x), S1(x), S2(x), . . . , Sn(x), . . . .
For a ﬁxed value of x, if this sequence of partial sums converges to a limit S, that is, if
lim
n→∞Sn(x) = S, then we say that the power series converges to S for this value of x.
A power series may converge for some values of x and not for others.
Example 1

25
+ · · · .
Solution
The series is about x = 2 and the odd terms are zero. We use (x−2)2n and begin with n = 2. Since
the series alternates and is positive for n = 2, we multiply by (−1)n. For n = 2, we divide by 4, for
n = 3 we divide by 9, and in general, we divide by n2. One way to write this series is

To investigate the convergence of this series, we look at the sequence of partial sums graphed in

9.5 POWER SERIES AND INTERVAL OF CONVERGENCE

Figure 9.11. The graph suggests that the partial sums converge for x in the interval (0, 2). In Ex-
amples 4 and 5, we show that the series converges for 0 < x ≤2. This is called the interval of
convergence of this series.
At x = 1.4, which is inside the interval, the series appears to converge quite rapidly:
S5(1.4) = 0.33698 . . .
S7(1.4) = 0.33653 . . .
S6(1.4) = 0.33630 . . .
S8(1.4) = 0.33645 . . .
Table 9.1 shows the results of using x = 1.9 and x = 2.3 in the power series. For x = 1.9,
which is inside the interval of convergence but close to an endpoint, the series converges, though
rather slowly. For x = 2.3, which is outside the interval of convergence, the series diverges: the
larger the value of n, the more wildly the series oscillates. In fact, the contribution of the twenty-
ﬁfth term is about 28; the contribution of the hundredth term is about −2,500,000,000. Figure 9.11
shows the interval of convergence and the partial sums.

Notice that the interval of convergence, 0 < x ≤2, is centered on x = 1. Since the interval
extends one unit on either side, we say the radius of convergence of this series is 1.
Intervals of Convergence
Each power series falls into one of three cases, characterized by its radius of convergence, R. This
radius gives an interval of convergence.
• The series converges only for x = a; the radius of convergence is deﬁned to be R = 0.
• The series converges for all values of x; the radius of convergence is deﬁned to be
R = ∞.
• There is a positive number R, called the radius of convergence, such that the series
converges for |x −a| < R and diverges for |x −a| > R. See Figure 9.12.
Using the radius of convergence, we make the following deﬁnition:
• The interval of convergence is the interval between a −R and a + R, including any
endpoint where the series converges.

ﬁnd the values of x for which the power series
∞
+
n=0
Cn(x −a)n converges, we use the ratio test.
Writing an = Cn(x −a)n and assuming Cn ̸= 0 and x ̸= a, we have
lim
n→∞
|an+1|
|an|
= lim
n→∞
|Cn+1(x −a)n+1|
|Cn(x −a)n|
= lim
n→∞
|Cn+1||x −a|
|Cn|
= |x −a| lim
n→∞
|Cn+1|
|Cn| .
Case 1. Suppose lim
n→∞|an+1|/|an| is inﬁnite. Then the ratio test shows that the power series con-
verges only for x = a. The radius of convergence is R = 0.
Case 2. Suppose lim
n→∞|an+1|/|an| = 0. Then the ratio test shows that the power series converges
for all x. The radius of convergence is R = ∞.
Case 3. Suppose lim
n→∞|an+1|/|an| = K|x −a|, where lim
n→∞|Cn+1|/|Cn| = K. In Case 1, K
does not exist; in Case 2, K = 0. Thus, we can assume K exists and K ̸= 0, and we can deﬁne
R = 1/K. Then we have
lim
n→∞
|an+1|
|an|
= K|x −a| = |x −a|
R
,
so the ratio test tells us that the power series:
• Converges for |x −a|
R
< 1; that is, for |x −a| < R
• Diverges for |x −a|
R
> 1; that is, for |x −a| > R.
The results are summarized in the following theorem.
Theorem 9.10: Method for Computing Radius of Convergence
To calculate the radius of convergence, R, for the power series
∞
+
n=0
Cn(x −a)n, use the ratio
test with an = Cn(x −a)n.
• If lim
n→∞|an+1|/|an| is inﬁnite, then R = 0.
• If lim
n→∞|an+1|/|an| = 0, then R = ∞.
• If lim
n→∞|an+1|/|an| = K|x −a|, where K is ﬁnite and nonzero, then R = 1/K.
Note that the ratio test does not tell us anything if limn→∞|an+1|/|an| fails to exist, which can
occur, for example, if some of the Cns are zero.
A proof that a power series has a radius of convergence and of Theorem 9.10 is given in the
online theory supplement. To understand these facts informally, we can think of a power series as
being like a geometric series whose coefﬁcients vary from term to term. The radius of convergence
depends on the behavior of the coefﬁcients: if there are constants C and K such that for larger and
larger n,
|Cn| ≈CKn,
then it is plausible that * Cnxn and * CKnxn = * C(Kx)n converge or diverge together. The
geometric series * C(Kx)n converges for |Kx| < 1, that is, for |x| < 1/K. We can ﬁnd K using
the ratio test, because

Example 3
Show that the following power series converges for all x:
1 + x + x2
2! + x3
3! + · · · + xn
n! + · · · .
Solution
Because Cn = 1/n!, none of the Cns are zero and we can use the ratio test:
lim

|an+1|
|an|

n→∞
|Cn+1|
|Cn|

n→∞

(n + 1)! = |x| lim
n→∞

n + 1 = 0.
This gives R = ∞, so the series converges for all x. We see in Chapter 10 that it converges to ex.

4 · 34
+ · · · + (−1)n−1 (x −1)n
n · 3n
+ · · · .
What does this tell us about the interval of convergence of this series?
Solution
Because Cn = (−1)n−1/(n · 3n) is never zero we can use the ratio test. We have
lim
n→∞
|an+1|
|an|
= |x−1| lim
n→∞
|Cn+1|

.
Thus, K = 1/3 in Theorem 9.10, so the radius of convergence is R = 1/K = 3. The power series
converges for |x −1| < 3 and diverges for |x −1| > 3, so the series converges for −2 < x < 4.
Notice that the radius of convergence does not tell us what happens at the endpoints, x = −2 and
x = 4. The endpoints are investigated in Example 5.
What Happens at the Endpoints of the Interval of Convergence?
The ratio test does not tell us whether a power series converges at the endpoints of its interval of
convergence, x = a ± R. There is no simple theorem that answers this question. Since substituting
x = a ± R converts the power series to a series of numbers, the tests in Sections 9.3 and 9.4 are
often useful.

3 · 33
−(x −1)4
4 · 34
+ · · · + (−1)n−1 (x −1)n
n · 3n
+ · · · .
Solution
In Example 4 we showed that this series has R = 3; it converges for −2 < x < 4 and diverges for
x < −2 or x > 4. We need to determine whether it converges at the endpoints of the interval of
convergence, x = −2 and x = 4. At x = 4, we have the series
1 −1
2 + 1
3 −1
4 + · · · + (−1)n−1
n
+ · · · .
This is an alternating series with an = 1/(n + 1), so by the alternating series test (Theorem 9.8), it
converges. At x = −2, we have the series
−1 −1
2 −1
3 −1
4 −· · · −1
n −· · · .
This is the negative of the harmonic series, so it diverges. Therefore, the interval of convergence is
−2 < x ≤4. The right endpoint is included and the left endpoint is not.

Chapter Nine SEQUENCES AND SERIES
Series with All Odd, or All Even, Terms
The ratio test requires lim
n→∞|an+1|/|an| to exist for an = Cn(x −a)n. What happens if the power
series has only even or odd powers, so some of the coefﬁcients Cn are zero? Then we use the fact
that an inﬁnite series can be written in several ways and pick one in which the terms are nonzero.
Example 6
Find the radius and interval of convergence of the series
1 + 22x2 + 24x4 + 26x6 + · · · .
Solution
If we take an = 2nxn for n even and an = 0 for n odd, lim
n→∞|an+1|/|an| does not exist. Therefore,
for this series we take
an = 22nx2n,
so that, replacing n by n + 1, we have
an+1 = 22(n+1)x2(n+1) = 22n+2x2n+2.
Thus,
|an+1|
|an|
=
22n+2x2n+2
|22nx2n|
=
22x2 = 4x2.
We have
lim
n→∞
|an+1|
|an|
= 4x2.
The ratio test guarantees that the power series converges if 4x2 < 1, that is, if |x| < 1
2. The radius
of convergence is 1
2. The series converges for −1
2 < x < 1
2 and diverges for x > 1
2 or x < −1
2. At
x = ± 1
2, all the terms in the series are 1, so the series diverges (by Theorem 9.2, Property 3). Thus,
the interval of convergence is −1
2 < x < 1
2.
Example 7
Write the general term an of the following series so that none of the terms are zero:
x −x3
3! + x5
5! −x7
7! + x9
9! −· · · .
Solution
This series has only odd powers. We can get odd integers using 2n −1 for n ≥1, since
2 · 1 −1 = 1,
2 · 2 −1 = 3,
2 · 3 −1 = 5, etc.
Also, the signs of the terms alternate, with the ﬁrst (that is, n = 1) term positive, so we include a
factor of (−1)n−1. Thus we get
an = (−1)n−1
x2n−1
(2n −1)!.
We see in Chapter 10 that the series converges to sin x. Exercise 24 shows that the radius of conver-
gence of this series is inﬁnite, so that it converges for all values of x.

81. Before World War I, the British government issued what
are called consols, which pay the owner or his heirs a
ﬁxed amount of money every year forever. (Cartoonists
of the time described aristocrats living off such payments
as “pickled in consols.”) What should a person expect to
pay for consols which pay £10 a year forever? Assume
the ﬁrst payment is one year from the date of purchase
and that interest remains 4% per year, compounded an-
nually. (£ denotes pounds, the British unit of currency.)
82. This problem illustrates how banks create credit and can
thereby lend out more money than has been deposited.
Suppose that initially $100 is deposited in a bank. Ex-
perience has shown bankers that on average only 8% of
the money deposited is withdrawn by the owner at any
time. Consequently, bankers feel free to lend out 92% of
their deposits. Thus $92 of the original $100 is loaned
out to other customers (to start a business, for example).
This $92 becomes someone else’s income and, sooner or
later, is redeposited in the bank. Thus 92% of $92, or
$92(0.92) = $84.64, is loaned out again and eventu-
ally redeposited. Of the $84.64, the bank again loans out
92%, and so on.
(a) Find the total amount of money deposited in the
bank as a result of these transactions.

1. Medical Case Study: Drug Desensitization Schedule11
Some patients have allergic reactions to critical medications for which there are no ef-
fective alternatives. In some such cases, the drug can be given safely by a process known as
drug desensitization. Desensitization starts by administering a very small amount of the needed
medication intravenously, and then progressively increasing the concentration or the rate that
the drug is infused until the full dose is achieved.
An example of a drug desensitization regimen is shown in Table 9.2. Three solutions of
the drug at different concentrations (full strength, 10-fold diluted, and 100-fold diluted) are
prepared. The procedure starts with a low rate of infusion of the most dilute solution and pro-
gresses in 15 minute steps until the highest infusion rate of the most concentrated solution is
reached. At the last stage, the infusion runs until the target dose is reached.
(a) For a target dose of 500 mg of a drug and a full strength solution of 2 mg/ml, make a
spreadsheet that enables you to ﬁll out the ﬁrst 11 steps in Table 9.2, each of which runs for
15 minutes.
(b) How much of the drug is administered in the 12th step? How long does this step last? Fill
in the last row of the table.
(c) Show how a geometric series can be used to calculate the total drug administered in the ﬁrst
11 steps.

3. Probability of Winning in Sports
In certain sports, winning a game requires a lead of two points. That is, if the score is tied
you have to score two points in a row to win.
(a) For some sports (e.g. tennis), a point is scored every play. Suppose your probability of
scoring the next point is always p. Then, your opponent’s probability of scoring the next
point is always 1 −p.
(i) What is the probability that you win the next two points?
(ii) What is the probability that you and your opponent split the next two points, that is,
that neither of you wins both points?
(iii) What is the probability that you split the next two points but you win the two after
that?
(iv) What is the probability that you either win the next two points or split the next two and
then win the next two after that?
(v) Give a formula for your probability w of winning a tied game.
(vi) Compute your probability of winning a tied game when p = 0.5; when p = 0.6; when
p = 0.7; when p = 0.4. Comment on your answers.
(b) In other sports (e.g. volleyball prior to 1999), you can score a point only if it is your turn,
with turns alternating until a point is scored. Suppose your probability of scoring a point
when it is your turn is p, and your opponent’s probability of scoring a point when it is her
turn is q.
(i) Find a formula for the probability S that you are the ﬁrst to score the next point,
assuming it is currently your turn.
(ii) Suppose that if you score a point, the next turn is yours. Using your answers to part (a)
and your formula for S, compute the probability of winning a tied game (if you need
two points in a row to win).
• Assume p = 0.5 and q = 0.5 and it is your turn.
• Assume p = 0.6 and q = 0.5 and it is your turn.
4. Prednisone
Prednisone is often prescribed for acute asthma attacks. For 5 mg tablets, typical instructions
are: “Take 8 tablets the ﬁrst day, 7 the second, and decrease by one tablet each day until all
tablets are gone.” Prednisone decays exponentially in the body, and 24 hours after taking k mg,
there are kx mg in the body.
(a) Write formulas involving x for the amount of prednisone in the body
(i) 24 hours after taking the ﬁrst dose (of 8 tablets), right before taking the second dose
(of 7 tablets).
(ii) Immediately after taking the second dose (of 7 tablets).

Chapter Ten APPROXIMATING FUNCTIONS USING SERIES
10.1
TAYLOR POLYNOMIALS
In this section, we see how to approximate a function by polynomials.
Linear Approximations
We already know how to approximate a function using a degree-1 polynomial, namely the tangent
line approximation given in Section 3.9 :
f(x) ≈f(a) + f ′(a)(x −a).
The tangent line and the curve have the same slope at x = a. As Figure 10.1 suggests, the tangent
line approximation to the function is generally more accurate for values of x close to a.

Figure 10.1: Tangent line approximation of f(x) for x near a
We ﬁrst focus on a = 0. The tangent line approximation at x = 0 is referred to as the ﬁrst
Taylor approximation at x = 0, or as follows:
Taylor Polynomial of Degree 1 Approximating f(x) for x near 0
f(x) ≈P1(x) = f(0) + f ′(0)x
Example 1
Find the Taylor polynomial of degree 1 for g(x) = cos x, with x in radians, for x near 0.
Solution
The tangent line at x = 0 is just the horizontal line y = 1, as shown in Figure 10.2, so P1(x) = 1.
We have
g(x) = cos x ≈1,
for x near 0.
If we take x = 0.05, then
g(0.05) = cos(0.05) = 0.998 . . .,
which is quite close to the approximation cos x ≈1. Similarly, if x = −0.1, then
g(−0.1) = cos(−0.1) = 0.995 . . .
is close to the approximation cos x ≈1. However, if x = 0.4, then
g(0.4) = cos(0.4) = 0.921 . . .,
so the approximation cos x ≈1 is less accurate. For x near 0, the graph suggests that the farther x
is from 0, the worse the approximation, cos x ≈1, is likely to be.

10.1 TAYLOR POLYNOMIALS
539
The previous example shows that the Taylor polynomial of degree 1 might actually have degree
less than 1.
Quadratic Approximations
To get a more accurate approximation, we use a quadratic function instead of a linear function.
Example 2
Find the quadratic approximation to g(x) = cos x for x near 0.
Solution
To ensure that the quadratic, P2(x), is a good approximation to g(x) = cos x at x = 0, we require
that cos x and the quadratic have the same value, the same slope, and the same second derivative at
x = 0. That is, we require P2(0) = g(0), P ′
2(0) = g′(0), and P ′′
2 (0) = g′′(0). We take the quadratic
polynomial
P2(x) = C0 + C1x + C2x2
and determine C0, C1, and C2. Since
P2(x) = C0 + C1x + C2x2
and
g(x) = cos x
P ′
2(x) = C1 + 2C2x
g′(x) = −sin x
P ′′
2 (x) = 2C2
g′′(x) = −cos x,
we have
C0 = P2(0) = g(0) = cos 0 = 1
so
C0 = 1
C1 = P ′
2(0) = g′(0) = −sin 0 = 0
C1 = 0
2C2 = P ′′
2 (0) = g′′(0) = −cos 0 = −1,
C2 = −1
2.
Consequently, the quadratic approximation is
cos x ≈P2(x) = 1 + 0 · x −1
2x2 = 1 −x2

Figure 10.3 suggests that the quadratic approximation cos x ≈P2(x) is better than the linear
approximation cos x ≈P1(x) for x near 0. Let’s compare the accuracy of the two approximations.
Recall that P1(x) = 1 for all x. At x = 0.4, we have cos(0.4) = 0.921 . . . and P2(0.4) = 0.920,
so the quadratic approximation is a signiﬁcant improvement over the linear approximation. The
magnitude of the error is about 0.001 instead of 0.08.

Higher-Degree Polynomials
In a small interval around x = 0, the quadratic approximation to a function is usually a better
approximation than the linear (tangent line) approximation. However, Figure 10.3 shows that the
quadratic can still bend away from the original function for large x. We can attempt to ﬁx this by
using an approximating polynomial of higher degree. Suppose that we approximate a function f(x)
for x near 0 by a polynomial of degree n:
f(x) ≈Pn(x) = C0 + C1x + C2x2 + · · · + Cn−1xn−1 + Cnxn.
We need to ﬁnd the values of the constants: C0, C1, C2, . . . , Cn. To do this, we require that
the function f(x) and each of its ﬁrst n derivatives agree with those of the polynomial Pn(x) at
the point x = 0. In general, the higher the degree of a Taylor polynomial, the larger the interval on
which the function and the polynomial remain close to each other.
To see how to ﬁnd the constants, let’s take n = 3 as an example:
f(x) ≈P3(x) = C0 + C1x + C2x2 + C3x3.
Substituting x = 0 gives
f(0) = P3(0) = C0.
Differentiating P3(x) yields
P ′
3(x) = C1 + 2C2x + 3C3x2,
so substituting x = 0 shows that
f ′(0) = P ′
3(0) = C1.
Differentiating and substituting again, we get
P ′′
3 (x) = 2 · 1C2 + 3 · 2 · 1C3x,
which gives
f ′′(0) = P ′′
3 (0) = 2 · 1C2,
so that
C2 = f ′′(0)
2 · 1 .
The third derivative, denoted by P ′′′
3 , is
P ′′′
3 (x) = 3 · 2 · 1C3,
so
f ′′′(0) = P ′′′
3 (0) = 3 · 2 · 1C3,
and then
C3 = f ′′′(0)
3 · 2 · 1.
You can imagine a similar calculation starting with P4(x) and using the fourth derivative f (4),
which would give
C4 =
f (4)(0)
4 · 3 · 2 · 1,
and so on. Using factorial notation,1 we write these expressions as
C3 = f ′′′(0)
3!
,
C4 = f (4)(0)

1Recall that k! = k(k −1) · · · 2 · 1. In addition, 1! = 1, and 0! = 1.

10.1 TAYLOR POLYNOMIALS

Writing f (n) for the nth derivative of f, we have, for any positive integer n,
Cn = f (n)(0)
n!
.
So we deﬁne the nth Taylor approximation at x = 0:

We call Pn(x) the Taylor polynomial of degree n centered at x = 0 or the Taylor polynomial
about (or around) x = 0.
Example 3
Construct the Taylor polynomial of degree 7 approximating the function f(x) = sin x for x near 0.
Compare the value of the Taylor approximation with the true value of f at x = π/3.
Solution
We have
f(x) =
sin x
giving
f(0) =
0
f ′(x) =
cos x
f ′(0) =
1
f ′′(x) = −sin x
f ′′(0) =

f ′′′(x) = −cos x
f ′′′(0) = −1
f (4)(x) =

f (4)(0) =

f (5)(x) =
cos x
f (5)(0) =
1
f (6)(x) = −sin x
f (6)(0) =
0
f (7)(x) = −cos x
f (7)(0) = −1.
Using these values, we see that the Taylor polynomial approximation of degree 7 is
sin x ≈P7(x) = 0 + 1 · x + 0
2! · x2 −1
3! · x3 + 0
4! · x4 + 1

for x near 0.
Notice that since f (8)(0) = 0, the seventh and eighth Taylor approximations to sin x are the same.
In Figure 10.4 we show the graphs of the sine function and the approximating polynomial of
degree 7 for x near 0. They are indistinguishable where x is close to 0. However, as we look at values
of x farther away from 0 in either direction, the two graphs move apart. To check the accuracy of this
approximation numerically, we see how well it approximates sin(π/3) =

Example 5
Construct the Taylor polynomial of degree 10 about x = 0 for the function f(x) = ex.
Solution
We have f(0) = 1. Since the derivative of ex is equal to ex, all the higher-order derivatives are equal
to ex. Consequently, for any k = 1, 2, . . ., 10, f (k)(x) = ex and f (k)(0) = e0 = 1. Therefore, the
Taylor polynomial approximation of degree 10 is given by
ex ≈P10(x) = 1 + x + x2
2! + x3
3! + x4
4! + · · · + x10
10! ,
for x near 0.
To check the accuracy of this approximation,we use it to approximate e = e1 = 2.718281828 . . ..
Substituting x = 1 gives P10(1) = 2.718281801. Thus, P10 yields the ﬁrst seven decimal places
for e. For large values of x, however, the accuracy diminishes because ex grows faster than any
polynomial as x →∞. Figure 10.6 shows graphs of f(x) = ex and the Taylor polynomials of
degree n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Notice that each successive approximation remains close to the exponential
curve for a larger interval of x-values.

Example 6
Construct the Taylor polynomial of degree n approximating f(x) =

Solution
Differentiating gives f(0) = 1, f ′(0) = 1, f ′′(0) = 2, f ′′′(0) = 3!, f (4)(0) = 4!, and so on. This
means
1
1 −x ≈Pn(x) = 1 + x + x2 + x3 + x4 + · · · + xn,
for x near 0.
Let us compare the Taylor polynomial with the formula obtained from the sum of a ﬁnite geometric
series on page 500:

10.1 TAYLOR POLYNOMIALS
543

1 −x
= 1 + x + x2 + x3 + x4 + · · · + xn.
If x is close to 0 and xn+1 is small enough to neglect, the formula for the sum of a ﬁnite geometric
series gives us the Taylor approximation of degree n:
1
1 −x ≈1 + x + x2 + x3 + x4 + · · · + xn.
Taylor Polynomials Around x = a
Suppose we want to approximate f(x) = ln x by a Taylor polynomial. This function has no Taylor
polynomial about x = 0 because the function is not deﬁned for x ≤0. However, it turns out that
we can construct a polynomial centered about some other point, x = a.
First, let’s look at the equation of the tangent line at x = a:
y = f(a) + f ′(a)(x −a).
This gives the ﬁrst Taylor approximation
f(x) ≈f(a) + f ′(a)(x −a)
for x near a.
The f ′(a)(x−a) term is a correction term that approximates the change in f as x moves away from
a.
Similarly, the Taylor polynomial Pn(x) centered at x = a is set up as f(a) plus correction
terms that are zero for x = a. This is achieved by writing the polynomial in powers of (x −a)
instead of powers of x:
f(x) ≈Pn(x) = C0 + C1(x −a) + C2(x −a)2 + · · · + Cn(x −a)n.
If we require n derivatives of the approximating polynomial Pn(x) and the original function f(x)
to agree at x = a, we get the following result for the nth Taylor approximation at x = a:
Taylor Polynomial of Degree n Approximating f(x) for x near a
f(x) ≈Pn(x)
= f(a) + f ′(a)(x −a) + f ′′(a)
2!
(x −a)2 + · · · + f (n)(a)
n!
(x −a)n
We call Pn(x) the Taylor polynomial of degree n centered at x = a or the Taylor polyno-
mial about x = a.
You can derive the formula for these coefﬁcients in the same way that we did for a = 0. (See
Problem 34, page 545.)
Example 7
Construct the Taylor polynomial of degree 4 approximating the function f(x) = ln x for x near 1.
Solution
We have
f(x) =
ln x
so
f(1) = ln(1) = 0
f ′(x) =
1/x
f ′(1) =
1
f ′′(x) = −1/x2
f ′′(1) =

f ′′′(x) =

f ′′′(1) =
2
f (4)(x) = −6/x4,
f (4)(1) =

Figure 10.7: Taylor polynomials approximate ln x closely for x near 1, but not necessarily farther away
Graphs of ln x and several of its Taylor polynomials are shown in Figure 10.7. Notice that
P4(x) stays reasonably close to ln x for x near 1, but bends away as x gets farther from 1. Also,
note that the Taylor polynomials are deﬁned for x ≤0, but ln x is not.
The examples in this section suggest that the following results are true for common functions:
• Taylor polynomials centered at x = a give good approximations to f(x) for x near a. Farther
away, they may or may not be good.
• The higher the degree of the Taylor polynomial, the larger the interval over which it ﬁts the
function closely.

TAYLOR SERIES
In the previous section we saw how to approximate a function near a point by Taylor polynomials.
Now we deﬁne a Taylor series, which is a power series that can be thought of as a Taylor polynomial
that goes on forever.
Taylor Series for cos x, sin x, ex
We have the following Taylor polynomials centered at x = 0 for cos x:
cos x ≈P0(x) = 1
cos x ≈P2(x) = 1 −x2
2!
cos x ≈P4(x) = 1 −x2

cos x ≈P8(x) = 1 −x2

8! .
Here we have a sequence of polynomials, P0(x), P2(x), P4(x), P6(x), P8(x), ..., each of which is a
better approximation to cos x than the last, for x near 0. When we go to a higher-degree polynomial
(say from P6 to P8), we add more terms (x8/8!, for example), but the terms of lower degree don’t
change. Thus, each polynomial includes the information from all the previous ones. We represent
the whole sequence of Taylor polynomials by writing the Taylor series for cos x:
1 −x2
2! + x4
4! −x6
6! + x8
8! −· · · .
Notice that the partial sums of this series are the Taylor polynomials, Pn(x).
We deﬁne the Taylor series for sin x and ex similarly. It turns out that, for these functions, the
Taylor series converges to the function for all x, so we can write the following:
sin x = x −x3
3! + x5
5! −x7

These series are also called Taylor expansions of the functions sin x, cos x, and ex about x = 0. The
general term of a Taylor series is a formula which gives any term in the series. For example, xn/n!
is the general term in the Taylor expansion for ex, and (−1)kx2k/(2k)! is the general term in the
expansion for cos x. We call n or k the index.
Taylor Series in General
Any function f, all of whose derivatives exist at 0, has a Taylor series. However, the Taylor series
for f does not necessarily converge to f(x) for all values of x. For the values of x for which the
series does converge to f(x), we have the following formula:
Taylor Series for f(x) About x = 0
f(x) = f(0) + f ′(0)x + f ′′(0)
2!
x2 + f ′′′(0)
3!
x3 + · · · + f (n)(0)
n!
xn + · · ·
In addition, just as we have Taylor polynomials centered at points other than 0, we can also
have a Taylor series centered at x = a (provided all the derivatives of f exist at x = a). For the
values of x for which the series converges to f(x), we have the following formula:
Taylor Series for f(x) About x = a
f(x) = f(a) + f ′(a)(x −a) + f ′′(a)

Chapter Ten APPROXIMATING FUNCTIONS USING SERIES
The Taylor series is a power series whose partial sums are the Taylor polynomials. As we saw in
Section 9.5, power series generally converge on an interval centered at x = a.
For a given function f and a given x, even if the Taylor series converges, it might not converge
to f(x). However, the Taylor series for most common functions, including ex, cos x, and sin x, do
converge to the original function for all x. See Section 10.4.
Convergence of Taylor Series
Let us look again at the Taylor polynomial for ln x about x = 1 that we derived in Example 7 on
page 543. A similar calculation gives the Taylor series
ln x = (x −1) −(x −1)2
2
+ (x −1)3
3
−(x −1)4
4
+ · · · + (−1)n−1 (x −1)n
n
+ · · · .
Example 4 on page 525 and Example 5 on page 525 show that this power series has interval of
convergence 0 < x ≤2. However, although we know that the series converges in this interval,
we do not yet know that its sum is ln x. The fact that in Figure 10.10 the polynomials ﬁt the curve
well for 0 < x < 2 suggests that the Taylor series does converge to ln x for 0 < x ≤2. For such
x-values, a higher-degree polynomial gives, in general, a better approximation.
However, when x > 2, the polynomials move away from the curve and the approximations get
worse as the degree of the polynomial increases. Thus, the Taylor polynomials are effective only
as approximations to ln x for values of x between 0 and 2; outside that interval, they should not
be used. Inside the interval, but near the ends, 0 or 2, the polynomials converge very slowly. This
means we might have to take a polynomial of very high degree to get an accurate value for ln x.

Proving that the Taylor series converges to ln x between 0 and 2, as Figure 10.10 suggests,
requires the error term introduced in Section 10.4.

Since the series for ln x about x = 1 converges to ln x for x between 0 and 2, the Taylor series for
ln(1 + x) about x = 0 converges to ln(1 + x) for x between −1 and 1. Notice that the series could
not possibly converge to ln(1 + x) for x ≤−1 since ln(1 + x) is not deﬁned there.

The Binomial Series Expansion
We now ﬁnd the Taylor series about x = 0 for the function f(x) = (1 + x)p, with p a constant, but
not necessarily a positive integer. Taking derivatives:
f(x) = (1 + x)p
so
f(0) = 1
f ′(x) = p(1 + x)p−1
f ′(0) = p
f ′′(x) = p(p −1)(1 + x)p−2
f ′′(0) = p(p −1)
f ′′′(x) = p(p −1)(p −2)(1 + x)p−3,
f ′′′(0) = p(p −1)(p −2).
Thus, the third-degree Taylor polynomial for x near 0 is
(1 + x)p ≈P3(x) = 1 + px + p(p −1)
2!
x2 + p(p −1)(p −2)
3!
x3.
Graphing P3(x), P4(x), . . . for various speciﬁc values of p suggests that the Taylor polynomials
converge to f(x) for −1 < x < 1. (See Problems 26–27, page 551.) The Taylor series for f(x) =
(1 + x)p about x = 0 is as follows:

(1 + x)p = 1 + px + p(p −1)
2!
x2 + p(p −1)(p −2)

for −1 < x < 1.
In fact, when p is a positive integer, the binomial series gives the same result as multiplying
(1 + x)p out. (Newton discovered that the binomial series can be used for noninteger exponents.)

FINDING AND USING TAYLOR SERIES
Finding a Taylor series for a function means ﬁnding the coefﬁcients. Assuming the function has all
its derivatives deﬁned, ﬁnding the coefﬁcients can always be done, in theory at least, by differentia-
tion. That is how we derived the four most important Taylor series, those for the functions ex, sin x,
cos x, and (1 + x)p.
For many functions, however, computing Taylor series coefﬁcients by differentiation can be a
very laborious business. We now introduce easier ways of ﬁnding Taylor series, if the series we want
is closely related to a series that we already know.
New Series by Substitution
Suppose we want to ﬁnd the Taylor series for e−x2 about x = 0. We could ﬁnd the coefﬁcients
by differentiation. Differentiating e−x2 by the chain rule gives −2xe−x2, and differentiating again
gives −2e−x2 + 4x2e−x2. Each time we differentiate we use the product rule, and the number of
terms grows. Finding the tenth or twentieth derivative of e−x2, and thus the series for e−x2 up to
the x10 or x20 terms, by this method is tiresome (at least without a computer or calculator that can
differentiate).
Fortunately, there’s a quicker way. Recall that
ey = 1 + y + y2
2! + y3
3! + y4
4! + · · ·
for all y.
Substituting y = −x2 tells us that
e−x2 = 1 + (−x2) + (−x2)2

+ (−x2)4
4!
+ · · ·
= 1 −x2 + x4
2! −x6
3! + x8
4! −· · ·
for all x.
Using this method, it is easy to ﬁnd the series up to the x10 or x20 terms. It can be shown that this
is the Taylor series for e−x2.

Example 1

Solution
The binomial series tells us that

1 + y = (1 + y)−1 = 1 −y + y2 −y3 + y4 −· · ·
for −1 < y < 1.
Substituting y = x2 gives
1
1 + x2 = 1 −x2 + x4 −x6 + x8 −· · ·
for −1 < x < 1,
which is the Taylor series for
1
1 + x2 .
New Series by Differentiation and Integration
Just as we can get new series by substitution, we can also get new series by differentiation and
integration. Term-by-term differentiation of a Taylor series for f(x) gives a Taylor series for f ′(x);
antidifferentiation works similarly.

for −1 < x < 1.
Multiplying and Substituting Taylor Series
We can also form a Taylor series for a product of two functions. In some cases, this is easy; for
example, if we want to ﬁnd the Taylor series about x = 0 for the function f(x) = x2 sin x, we can
start with the Taylor series for sin x,
sin x = x −x3

However, in some cases, ﬁnding a Taylor series for a product of two functions requires more work.
Example 4
Find the Taylor series about x = 0 for g(x) = sin x cos x.
Solution
The Taylor series about x = 0 for sin x and cos x are
sin x = x −x3

cos x = 1 −x2

3! + x5
5! −· · ·
 
1 −x2
2! + x4
4! −· · ·

.
To multiply these two series, we must multiply each term of the series for sin x by each term of
the series for cos x. Because each series has inﬁnitely many terms, we organize the process by ﬁrst
determining the constant term of the product, then the linear term, and so on.
The constant term of this product is zero because there is no combination of a term from the
ﬁrst series and a term from the second that yields a constant. The linear term of the product is x;
we obtain this term by multiplying the x from the ﬁrst series by the 1 from the second. The degree-
2 term of the product is also zero; more generally, we notice that every even-degree term of the
product is zero because every combination of a term from the ﬁrst series and a term from the second
yields an odd-degree term. To ﬁnd the degree-3 term, observe that the combinations of terms that
yield degree-3 terms are x · −x2
2! = −1
2x3 and −x3
3! · 1 = −1
6x3, and thus the degree-3 term is
−1
2x3 −1
6x3 = −2
3x3. Continuing in this manner, we ﬁnd that
g(x) = x −2
3x3 + 2
15x5 −· · · .
There is another way to ﬁnd this series. Notice that sin x cos x = 1
2 sin(2x). Substituting 2x into
the Taylor series about x = 0 for the sine function, we get
sin(2x) = 2x −(2x)3
3!
+ (2x)5
5!
−· · ·
= 2x −4
3x3 + 4
15x5 −· · · .
Therefore, we have
g(x) = 1
2 sin(2x) = x −2
3x3 + 2
15x5 −· · · .
We can also obtain a Taylor series for a composite function by substituting a Taylor series into
another one, as in the next example.

To simplify, we multiply out and collect terms. The only constant term is the 1, and there’s only one
θ term. The only θ2 term is the ﬁrst term we get by multiplying out the square, namely θ2/2!. There
are two contributors to the θ3 term: the −θ3/3! from within the ﬁrst parentheses and the ﬁrst term
we get from multiplying out the cube, which is θ3/3!. Thus the series starts

Use the series for arctanx to estimate the numerical value of π.
Solution
Since arctan 1 = π/4, we use the series for arctan x from Example 3. We assume—as is the

Table 10.1 shows the value of the nth partial sum, Sn, obtained by summing the nonzero terms
from 1 through n. The values of Sn do seem to converge to π = 3.141 . . .. However, this series
converges very slowly, meaning that we have to take a large number of terms to get an accurate
estimate for π. So this way of calculating π is not particularly practical. (A better one is given in
Project 2, page 583.) However, the expression for π given by this series is surprising and elegant.
A basic question we can ask about two functions is which one gives larger values. Taylor series
can often be used to answer this question over a small interval. If the constant terms of the series for
two functions are the same, compare the linear terms; if the linear terms are the same, compare the
quadratic terms, and so on.

By looking at their Taylor series, decide which of the following functions is largest for t near 0.

Solution
The Taylor expansion about t = 0 for et is
et = 1 + t + t2

Viewing 1/(1 −t) as the sum of a geometric series with initial term 1 and common ratio t, we have

1 −t = 1 + t + t2 + t3 + · · · for −1 < t < 1.

Chapter Ten APPROXIMATING FUNCTIONS USING SERIES
Notice that these two series have the same constant term and the same linear term. However, their
remaining terms are different. For values of t near zero, the quadratic terms dominate all of the
subsequent terms,4 so we can use the approximations
et ≈1 + t + t2

1 −t ≈1 + t + t2.
Since
1 + t + 1
2t2 < 1 + t + t2,
and since the approximations are valid for t near 0, we conclude that, for t near 0,
et <

1 −t.

Two electrical charges of equal magnitude and opposite signs located near one another are called
an electrical dipole. The charges Q and −Q are a distance r apart. (See Figure 10.15.) The electric
ﬁeld, E, at the point P, at a distance R from the dipole is given by
E = Q

Use series to investigate the behavior of the electric ﬁeld far to the left along the line through the
dipole. Show that when R is large in comparison to r, the electric ﬁeld is approximately proportional
to 1/R3.

Solution
In order to use a series approximation, we need a variable whose value is small. Although we know
that r is much smaller than R, we do not know that r itself is small. The quantity r/R is, however,
very small. Hence we expand 1/(R + r)2 in powers of r/R so that we can safely use only the ﬁrst
few terms of the Taylor series. First we rewrite using algebra:

(R + r)2 =

Since r/R is smaller than 1, the binomial expansion for (1+r/R)−2 converges. We are interested in
the electric ﬁeld far away from the dipole. The quantity r/R is small there, and (r/R)2 and higher
powers are smaller still. Thus, we approximate by disregarding all terms except the ﬁrst, giving
E ≈Q
R2
2r

so
E ≈2Qr
R3 .
Since Q and r are constants, this means that E is approximately proportional to 1/R3.
In the previous example, we say that E is expanded in terms of r/R, meaning that the variable
in the expansion is r/R.

THE ERROR IN TAYLOR POLYNOMIAL APPROXIMATIONS
In order to use an approximation with conﬁdence, we need to know how big the error could be. The
error is the difference between the exact answer and the approximate value. When we use Pn(x),
the nth-degree Taylor polynomial, to approximate f(x), the error is the difference
En(x) = f(x) −Pn(x).
We want to ﬁnd a bound on the magnitude of the error, |En|; that is, we want a number that we are
sure is bigger than |En|. In practice, we want a bound which is reasonably close to the maximum
value of |En|.
Lagrange found an expression for the error bound whose form is similar to a term in the Taylor
series:
Theorem 10.1: The Lagrange Error Bound for Pn(x)
Suppose f and all its derivatives are continuous. If Pn(x) is the nth Taylor polynomial for
f(x) about a, then
|En(x)| = |f(x) −Pn(x)| ≤
M
(n + 1)!|x −a|n+1,
where
f (n+1) ≤M on the interval between a and x.
To ﬁnd M in practice, we often ﬁnd the maximum of |f (n+1)| on the interval and pick any
larger value for M. See page 563 for a justiﬁcation of Theorem 10.1.
Using the Lagrange Error Bound for Taylor Polynomials
Example 1
Give a bound on the error, E4, when ex is approximated by its fourth-degree Taylor polynomial
about 0 for −0.5 ≤x ≤0.5.
Solution
Let f(x) = ex. We need to ﬁnd a bound for the ﬁfth derivative, f (5)(x) = ex. Since ex is increasing,
its largest value is at the endpoint of the interval:
|f (5)(x)| ≤e0.5 = √e
for −0.5 ≤x ≤0.5.

10.4 THE ERROR IN TAYLOR POLYNOMIAL APPROXIMATIONS
561
Since √e < 2, we can take M = 2 (or any larger value). Then
|E4| = |f(x) −P4(x)| ≤2
5!|x|5.
This means, for example, that on −0.5 ≤x ≤0.5, the approximation
ex ≈1 + x + x2
2! + x3
3! + x4
4!
has an error of at most
2
120(0.5)5 < 0.0006.
The Lagrange error bound for Taylor polynomials can be used to see how the accuracy of
the approximation depends on the value of x and the value of n. Observe that the error bound for a
Taylor polynomial of degree n is proportional to |x−a|n+1. That means, for example, with a Taylor
polynomial of degree n centered at 0, if we decrease x by a factor of 2, the error bound decreases
by a factor of 2n+1.
Example 2
Compare the errors in the approximations
e0.1 ≈1 + 0.1 + 1
2!(0.1)2
and
e0.05 ≈1 + (0.05) + 1
2!(0.05)2.
Solution
We are approximating ex by its second-degree Taylor polynomial about 0. We evaluate the poly-
nomial ﬁrst at x = 0.1, and then at x = 0.05. Since we have decreased x by a factor of 2, the
error bound decreases by a factor of about 23 = 8. To see what actually happens to the errors, we
compute them:
e0.1 −

1 + 0.1 + 1
2!(0.1)2

= 1.105171 −1.105000 = 0.000171
e0.05 −

1 + 0.05 + 1
2!(0.05)2

= 1.051271 −1.051250 = 0.000021
Since (0.000171)/(0.000021) = 8.1, the error has also decreased by a factor of about 8.
Convergence of the Taylor Series for cos x
We have already seen that the Taylor polynomials centered at x = 0 for cos x are good approxima-
tions for x near 0. (See Figure 10.17.) In fact, for any value of x, if we take a Taylor polynomial
centered at x = 0 of high enough degree, its graph is nearly indistinguishable from the graph of the
cosine function near that point.

Chapter Ten APPROXIMATING FUNCTIONS USING SERIES
It appears that the approximations converge to the true value, cos(π/2) = 0, very rapidly. Now take
a value of x somewhat farther away from 0, say x = π; then cos π = −1 and
P2(π) = 1 −(π)2/2! =
−3.93480 . . .

P14(π) =
· · ·
= −1.000004 . . ..
We see that the rate of convergence is somewhat slower; it takes a 14th-degree polynomial to ap-
proximate cos π as accurately as an 8th-degree polynomial approximates cos(π/2). If x were taken
still farther away from 0, then we would need still more terms to obtain as accurate an approximation
of cos x.
Exercise 18 on page 527 uses the ratio test to show that the Taylor series for cos x converges
for all values of x. In addition, we will prove that it converges to cos x using Theorem 10.1. Thus,
we are justiﬁed in writing the equality:
cos x = 1 −x2
2! + x4
4! −x6
6! + x8
8! −· · ·
for all x.
Showing that the Taylor Series for cos x Converges to cos x
The Lagrange error bound in Theorem 10.1 allows us to see if the Taylor series for a function
converges to that function. In the series for cos x, the odd powers are missing, so we assume n is
even and write
En(x) = cos x −Pn(x) = cos x −

1 −x2
2! + · · · + (−1)n/2 xn
n!

,
giving
cos x = 1 −x2
2! + · · · + (−1)n/2 xn
n! + En(x).
Thus, for the Taylor series to converge to cos x, we must have En(x) →0 as n →∞.
Showing En(x) →0 as n →∞
Proof Since f(x) = cos x, the (n + 1)st derivative, f (n+1)(x), is ± cosx or ± sin x, no matter what n is.
So for all n, we have |f (n+1)(x)| ≤1 on the interval between 0 and x.
By the Lagrange error bound with M = 1, we have
|En(x)| = | cos x −Pn(x)| ≤|x|n+1
(n + 1)!
for every n.
To show that the errors go to zero, we must show that for a ﬁxed x,
|x|n+1
(n + 1)! →0
as
n →∞.
To see why this is true, consider the ratio of successive terms of this sequence. We have
|x|n+2/(n + 2)!
|x|n+1/(n + 1)! =
|x|
n + 2.
Therefore, we obtain the (n+1)st term of this sequence, |x|n+2/(n+2)!, by multiplying the previous
term, |x|n+1/(n + 1)!, by |x|/(n + 2). Since |x| is ﬁxed and n + 2 is increasing, for sufﬁciently
large n, this ratio is less than 1/2 (or any other constant between 0 and 1). Thus eventually each
term in the sequence is less than 1/2 the previous term, so the sequence of errors approaches zero.
Therefore, the Taylor series 1 −x2/2! + x4/4! −· · · does converge to cos x.

10.4 THE ERROR IN TAYLOR POLYNOMIAL APPROXIMATIONS

Deriving the Lagrange Error Bound
Recall that we constructed Pn(x), the Taylor polynomial of f about 0, so that its ﬁrst n derivatives
equal the corresponding derivatives of f(x). Therefore, En(0) = 0, E′
n(0) = 0, E′′
n(0) = 0,
· · ·, E(n)
n (0) = 0. Since Pn(x) is an nth-degree polynomial, its (n + 1)st derivative is 0, so
E(n+1)
n
(x) = f (n+1)(x). In addition, suppose that
f (n+1)(x)
 is bounded by a positive constant
M, for all positive values of x near 0, say for 0 ≤x ≤d, so that
−M ≤f (n+1)(x) ≤M
for 0 ≤x ≤d.
This means that
−M ≤E(n+1)
n
(x) ≤M
for 0 ≤x ≤d.
Writing t for the variable, we integrate this inequality from 0 to x, giving

When x is to the left of 0, so −d ≤x ≤0, and when the Taylor series is centered at a ̸= 0,
similar calculations lead to Theorem 10.1.

FOURIER SERIES
We have seen how to approximate a function by a Taylor polynomial of ﬁxed degree. Such a poly-
nomial is usually very close to the true value of the function near one point (the point at which the
Taylor polynomial is centered), but not necessarily at all close anywhere else. In other words, Tay-
lor polynomials are good approximations of a function locally, but not necessarily globally. In this
section, we take another approach: we approximate the function by trigonometric functions, called
Fourier approximations. The resulting approximation may not be as close to the original function at
some points as the Taylor polynomial. However, the Fourier approximation is, in general, close over
a larger interval. In other words, a Fourier approximation can be a better approximation globally.
In addition, Fourier approximations are useful even for functions that are not continuous. Unlike
Taylor approximations, Fourier approximations are periodic, so they are particularly useful for ap-
proximating periodic functions.
Many processes in nature are periodic or repeating, so it makes sense to approximate them by
periodic functions. For example, sound waves are made up of periodic oscillations of air molecules.
Heartbeats, the movement of the lungs, and the electrical current that powers our homes are all
periodic phenomena. Two of the simplest periodic functions are the square wave in Figure 10.19
and the triangular wave in Figure 10.20. Electrical engineers use the square wave as the model for
the ﬂow of electricity when a switch is repeatedly ﬂicked on and off.

However, these formulas are not particularly easy to work with. Worse, the functions are not dif-
ferentiable at various points. Here we show how to approximate such functions by differentiable,
periodic functions.
Since sine and cosine are the simplest periodic functions, they are the building blocks we use.
Because they repeat every 2π, we assume that the function f we want to approximate repeats every
2π. (Later, we deal with the case where f has some other period.) We start by considering the
square wave in Figure 10.21. Because of the periodicity of all the functions concerned, we only
have to consider what happens in the course of a single period; the same behavior repeats in any
other period.

Fn(x) is known as a Fourier polynomial of degree n, named after the French mathematician Joseph
Fourier (1768–1830),who was one of the ﬁrst to investigate it.5 The coefﬁcients ak and bk are called
Fourier coefﬁcients. Since each of the component functions cos(kx) and sin(kx), k = 1, 2, . . ., n,
repeats every 2π, Fn(x) must repeat every 2π and so is a potentially good match for f(x), which
also repeats every 2π. The problem is to determine values for the Fourier coefﬁcients that achieve a
close match between f(x) and Fn(x). We choose the following values:

For an informal justiﬁcation for the use of these values, see page 573. In addition, the integrals over

and the graphs of the function and the ﬁrst Fourier approximation are shown in Figure 10.22.
We next construct the Fourier polynomial of degree 2. The coefﬁcients a0, a1, b1 are the same

as comparing Figure 10.23 to Figure 10.22 shows.

Figure 10.24 shows that higher-degree approximations match the step-like nature of the square wave
function more and more closely.
We could have used a Taylor series to approximate the square wave, provided we did not center
the series at a point of discontinuity. Since the square wave is a constant function on each interval,
all its derivatives are zero, and so its Taylor series approximations are the constant functions: 0 or 1,
depending on where the Taylor series is centered. They approximate the square wave perfectly on
each piece, but they do not do a good job over the whole interval of length 2π. That is what Fourier
polynomials succeed in doing: they approximate a curve fairly well everywhere, rather than just
near a particular point. The Fourier approximations above look a lot like square waves, so they ap-
proximate well globally. However, they may not give good values near points of discontinuity. (For
example, near x = 0, they all give values near 1/2, which are incorrect.) Thus Fourier polynomials
may not be good local approximations.
Taylor polynomials give good local approximations to a function;
Fourier polynomials give good global approximations to a function.
Fourier Series
As with Taylor polynomials, the higher the degree of the Fourier approximation, generally the more
accurate it is. Therefore, we carry this procedure on indeﬁnitely by letting n →∞, and we call the
resulting inﬁnite series a Fourier series.
The Fourier Series for f on [–π, π]
f(x) = a0 + a1 cos x + a2 cos 2x + a3 cos 3x + · · ·
+ b1 sin x + b2 sin 2x + b3 sin 3x + · · ·
where ak and bk are the Fourier coefﬁcients.
Thus, the Fourier series for the square wave is
f(x) = 1

5π sin 5x + 2
7π sin 7x + · · · .

Harmonics
Let us start with a function f(x) that is periodic with period 2π, expanded in a Fourier series:
f(x) = a0 + a1 cos x + a2 cos 2x + a3 cos 3x + · · ·

The function
ak cos kx + bk sin kx
is referred to as the kth harmonic of f, and it is customary to say that the Fourier series expresses f in
terms of its harmonics. The ﬁrst harmonic, a1 cos x+b1 sin x, is sometimes called the fundamental
harmonic of f.

You may have wondered why different musical instruments sound different, even when playing the
same note. A ﬁrst step might be to graph the periodic deviations from the average air pressure that
form the sound waves they produce. This has been done for clarinet and trumpet in Figure 10.28.6
However, it is more revealing to graph the energy spectra of these functions, as in Figure 10.29.
The most striking difference is the relative weakness of the second and fourth harmonics for the
clarinet, with the second harmonic completely absent. The trumpet sounds the second harmonic
with as much energy as it does the fundamental.

What Do We Do If Our Function Does Not Have Period 2π?
We can adapt our previous work to ﬁnd the Fourier series for a function of period b. Suppose f(x)
is given on the interval [−b/2, b/2]. In Problem 31, we see how to use a change of variable to get
the following result:

The constant 2πk/b is called the angular frequency of the kth harmonic; b is the period of f.
Note that the integrals over [−b/2, b/2] can be replaced by integrals over any interval of length b.

Solution
Since f(x) repeats outside the interval [−1, 1], we have b = 2. As an example of how the coefﬁcients
are computed, we ﬁnd b1. Since f(x) = 0 for −1 < x < 0,

Notice that the coefﬁcients in this series are the same as those in Example 1. This is because the

Seasonal Variation in the Incidence of Measles
Example 5
Fourier approximations have been used to analyze the seasonal variation in the incidence of dis-
eases. One study7 done in Baltimore, Maryland, for the years 1901–1931, studied I(t), the average
number of cases of measles per 10,000 susceptible children in the tth month of the year. The data
points in Figure 10.31 show f(t) = log I(t). The curve in Figure 10.31 shows the second Fourier
approximation of f(t). Figure 10.32 contains the graphs of the ﬁrst and second harmonics of f(t),
plotted separately as deviations about a0, the average logarithmic incidence rate. Describe what
these two harmonics tell you about incidence of measles.

Figure 10.32: First and second harmonics of f(t) plotted
as deviations from average log incidence rate, a0
Solution
Taking the log of I(t) has the effect of reducing the amplitude of the oscillations. However, since the
log of a function increases when the function increases and decreases when it decreases, oscillations
in f(t) correspond to oscillations in I(t).
Figure 10.32 shows that the ﬁrst harmonic in the Fourier series has a period of one year (the
same period as the original function); the second harmonic has a period of six months. The graph
in Figure 10.32 shows that the ﬁrst harmonic is approximately a sine function with amplitude about
0.7; the second harmonic is approximately the negative of a sine function with amplitude about 0.2.
Thus, for t in months (t = 0 in January),
log I(t) = f(t) ≈a0 + 0.7 sin
π
6 t

−0.2 sin

3 t

where π/6 and π/3 are introduced to make the periods 12 and 6 months, respectively. We can
estimate a0 from the original graph of f: it is the average value of f, approximately 1.5. Thus
f(t) ≈1.5 + 0.7 sin
π
6 t

−0.2 sin

3 t

.
Figure 10.31 shows that the second Fourier approximation of f(t) is quite good. The harmonics of
f(t) beyond the second must be rather insigniﬁcant. This suggests that the variation in incidence in
measles comes from two sources, one with a yearly cycle that is reﬂected in the ﬁrst harmonic and
one with a half-yearly cycle reﬂected in the second harmonic. At this point the mathematics can tell
us no more; we must turn to the epidemiologists for further explanation.
Informal Justification of the Formulas for the Fourier Coefficients
Recall that the coefﬁcients in a Taylor series (which is a good approximation locally) are found
by differentiation. In contrast, the coefﬁcients in a Fourier series (which is a good approximation
globally) are found by integration.
7From C. I. Bliss and D. L. Blevins, The Analysis of Seasonal Variation in Measles (Am. J. Hyg. 70, 1959), reported by
Edward Batschelet, Introduction to Mathematics for the Life Sciences (Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1979).

Thus a0 is the average value of f on the interval [−π, π].

, π

, π

and

3. Approximating the Derivative
In applications, the values of a function f(x) are frequently known only at discrete values
x0, x0 ± h, x0 ± 2h,. . . . Suppose we are interested in approximating the derivative f ′(x0).
The deﬁnition
f ′(x0) = lim
h→0
f(x0 + h) −f(x0)
h
suggests that for small h we can approximate f ′(x) as follows:
f ′(x0) ≈f(x0 + h) −f(x0)
h
.
Such ﬁnite-difference approximations are used frequently in programming a computer to solve
differential equations.11
Taylor series can be used to analyze the error in this approximation. Substituting
f(x0 + h) = f(x0) + f ′(x0)h + f ′′(x0)

into the approximation for f ′(x0), we ﬁnd
f(x0 + h) −f(x0)
h

This suggests (and it can be proved) that the error in the approximation is bounded as follows:

Notice that as h →0, the error also goes to zero, provided M is bounded.
As an example, we take f(x) = ex and x0 = 0, so f ′(x0) = 1. The error for various values
of h are given in Table 10.2. We see that decreasing h by a factor of 10 decreases the error by a
factor of about 10, as predicted by the error bound Mh/2.

11.1
WHAT IS A DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION?
How Fast Does a Person Learn?
Suppose we are interested in how fast an employee learns a new task. One theory claims that the
more the employee already knows of the task, the slower he or she learns. In other words, if y% is
the percentage of the task that has already been mastered and dy/dt the rate at which the employee
learns, then dy/dt decreases as y increases.
What can we say about y as a function of time, t? Figure 11.1 shows three graphs whose slope,
dy/dt, decreases as y increases. Figure 11.1(a) represents an employee who starts learning at t = 0
and who eventually masters 100% of the task. Figure 11.1(b) represents an employee who starts
later but eventually masters 100% of the task. Figure 11.1(c) represents an employee who starts
learning at t = 0 but who does not master the whole task (since y levels off below 100%).

Setting up a Differential Equation to Model How a Person Learns
To describe more precisely how a person learns, we need more exact information about how dy/dt
depends on y. Suppose, if time is measured in weeks, that
Rate a person learns
=
Percentage of task not yet learned.
Since y is the percentage learned by time t (in weeks), the percentage not yet learned by that time
is 100 −y. So we have
dy
dt = 100 −y.
Such an equation, which gives information about the rate of change of an unknown function, is
called a differential equation.
Solving the Differential Equation Numerically
Suppose that the person starts learning at time zero, so y = 0 when t = 0. Then initially the person
is learning at a rate
dy
dt = 100 −0 = 100% per week.
In other words, if the person were to continue learning at this rate, the task would be mastered in a
week. In fact, however, the rate at which the person learns decreases, so it takes more than a week
to get close to mastering the task. Let’s assume a ﬁve-day work week and that the 100% per week
learning rate holds for the whole ﬁrst day. (It does not, but we assume this for now.) One day is 1/5
of a week, so during the ﬁrst day the person learns 100(1/5) = 20% of the task. By the end of the
ﬁrst day, the rate at which the person learns has therefore been reduced to
dy
dt = 100 −20 = 80% per week.
Thus, during the second day the person learns 80(1/5) = 16%, so by the end of the second day, the
person knows 20 + 16 = 36% of the task. Continuing in this fashion, we compute the approximate
y-values1 in Table 11.1.
1The values of y after 6, 7, 8, 9, . . . , 19 days were computed by the same method, but omitted from the table.

A Formula for the Solution to the Differential Equation
A function y = f(t) that satisﬁes the differential equation is called a solution. Figure 11.1(a) shows
a possible solution, and Table 11.1 shows approximate numerical values of a solution to the equation
dy
dt = 100 −y.
Later in this chapter, we see how to obtain a formula for the solution:
y = 100 + Ce−t,
where C is a constant. To check that this formula is correct, we substitute into the differential
equation, giving:
Left side = dy
dt = d
dt(100 + Ce−t) = −Ce−t
Right side = 100 −y = 100 −(100 + Ce−t) = −Ce−t.
Since we get the same result on both sides, y = 100+Ce−t is a solution of this differential equation.
Finding the Arbitrary Constant: Initial Conditions
To ﬁnd a value for the arbitrary constant C, we need an additional piece of information—usually
the initial value of y. If, for example, we are told that y = 0 when t = 0, then substituting into
y = 100 + Ce−t
shows us that
0 = 100 + Ce0,
so
C = −100.
So the function y = 100 −100e−t satisﬁes the differential equation and the condition that y = 0
when t = 0.
The Family of Solutions
Any solution to this differential equation is of the form y = 100 + Ce−t for some constant C. Like
a family of antiderivatives, this family contains an arbitrary constant, C. We say that the general
solution to the differential equation dy/dt = 100 −y is the family of functions y = 100 + Ce−t.
The solution y = 100 −100e−t that satisﬁes the differential equation together with the initial
condition that y = 0 when t = 0 is called a particular solution. The differential equation and
the initial condition together are called an initial value problem. Several members of the family
of solutions are graphed in Figure 11.2. The horizontal solution curve when C = 0 is called an
equilibrium solution.

Chapter Eleven DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
First- and Second-Order Differential Equations
First, some more deﬁnitions. We often write y′ to represent the derivative of y. The differential
equation
y′ = 100 −y
is called ﬁrst-order because it involves the ﬁrst derivative, but no higher derivatives. By contrast, if
s is the height (in meters) of a body moving under the force of gravity and t is time (in seconds),
then
d2s
dt2 = −9.8.
This is a second-order differential equation because it involves the second derivative of the unknown
function, s = f(t), but no higher derivatives.
Example 1
Show that y = e2t is not a solution to the second-order differential equation
d2y
dt2 + 4y = 0.
Solution
To decide whether the function y = e2t is a solution, substitute it into the differential equation:
d2y
dt2 + 4y = 2(2e2t) + 4e2t = 8e2t.
Since 8e2t is not identically zero, y = e2t is not a solution.
How Many Arbitrary Constants Should We Expect in the Family of Solutions?
Since a differential equation involves the derivative of an unknown function, solving it usually in-
volves antidifferentiation, which introduces arbitrary constants. The solution to a ﬁrst-order differ-
ential equation usually involves one antidifferentiation and one arbitrary constant (for example, the
C in y = 100 + Ce−t). Picking out one particular solution involves knowing one additional piece
of information, such as an initial condition. Solving a second-order differential equation generally
involves two antidifferentiations and so two arbitrary constants. Consequently, ﬁnding a particular
solution usually involves two initial conditions.
For example, if s is the height (in meters) of a body above the surface of the earth at time t (in
seconds), then
d2s
dt2 = −9.8.
Integrating gives
ds
dt = −9.8t + C1,
and integrating again gives
s = −4.9t2 + C1t + C2.
Thus the general solution for s involves the two arbitrary constants C1 and C2. We can ﬁnd C1 and
C2 if we are told, for example, that the initial velocity is 30 meters per second upward and that the
initial position is 5 meters above the ground. In this case, C1 = 30 and C2 = 5.

SLOPE FIELDS
In this section, we see how to visualize a ﬁrst-order differential equation. We start with the equation
dy
dx = y.
Any solution to this differential equation has the property that the slope at any point is equal to the
y-coordinate at that point. (That’s what the equation dy/dx = y is telling us!) If the solution goes
through the point (0, 0.5), its slope there is 0.5; if it goes through a point with y = 1.5, its slope
there is 1.5. See Figure 11.4.
In Figure 11.4 a small line segment is drawn at each of the marked points showing the slope of
the curve there. Imagine drawing many of these line segments, but leaving out the curves; this gives
the slope ﬁeld for the equation dy/dx = y in Figure 11.5. From this picture, we can see that above
the x-axis, the slopes are all positive (because y is positive there), and they increase as we move
upward (as y increases). Below the x-axis, the slopes are all negative and get more so as we move
downward. On any horizontal line (where y is constant) the slopes are constant.

Figure 11.5: Slope ﬁeld for dy/dx = y
In the slope ﬁeld we can see the ghost of the solution curve lurking. Start anywhere on the plane
and move so that the slope lines are tangent to our path; we trace out one of the solution curves. We
think of the slope ﬁeld as a set of signposts pointing in the direction we should go at each point. In
this case, the slope ﬁeld should trace out exponential curves of the form y = Cex, the solutions to
the differential equation dy/dx = y.
Example 1
Figure 11.6 shows the slope ﬁeld of the differential equation dy/dx = 2x.
(a) How does the slope ﬁeld vary as we move around the xy-plane?
(b) Compare the solution curves sketched on the slope ﬁeld with the formula for the solutions.

Figure 11.7: Some solutions to dy/dx = 2x
Solution
(a) In Figure 11.6 we notice that on a vertical line (where x is constant) the slopes are constant.
This is because in this differential equation dy/dx depends on x only. (In the previous example,
dy/dx = y, the slopes depended on y only.)
(b) The solution curves in Figure 11.7 look like parabolas. By antidifferentiation, we see that the
solution to the differential equation dy/dx = 2x is
y =
,
2x dx = x2 + C,
so the solution curves really are parabolas.
Example 2
Using the slope ﬁeld, guess the form of the solution curves of the differential equation
dy
dx = −x
y .
Solution
The slope ﬁeld is shown in Figure 11.8. On the y-axis, where x is 0, the slope is 0. On the x-
axis, where y is 0, the line segments are vertical and the slope is inﬁnite. At the origin the slope is
undeﬁned, and there is no line segment.
The slope ﬁeld suggests that the solution curves are circles centered at the origin. Later we
see how to obtain the solution analytically, but even without this, we can check that the circle is a
solution. We take the circle of radius r,
x2 + y2 = r2,
and differentiate implicitly, thinking of y as a function of x. Using the chain rule, we get
2x + 2y · dy
dx = 0.
Solving for dy/dx gives our differential equation,
dy
dx = −x
y .
This tells us that x2 + y2 = r2 is a solution to the differential equation.

Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions
Since differential equations are used to model many real situations, the question of whether a so-
lution is unique can have great practical importance. If we know how the velocity of a satellite is
changing, can we know its velocity at any future time? If we know the initial population of a city
and we know how the population is changing, can we predict the population in the future? Com-
mon sense says yes: if we know the initial value of some quantity and we know exactly how it is
changing, we should be able to ﬁgure out its future value.

Figure 11.13: There’s one and only one solution curve through each
point in the plane for this slope ﬁeld (dots represent initial conditions).
In the language of differential equations, an initial value problem (that is, a differential equation
and an initial condition) almost always has a unique solution. One way to see this is by looking at
the slope ﬁeld. Imagine starting at the point representing the initial condition. Through that point
there is usually a line segment pointing in the direction of the solution curve. By following these
line segments, we trace out the solution curve. See Figure 11.13. In general, at each point there is
one line segment and therefore only one direction for the solution curve to go. The solution curve
exists and is unique provided we are given an initial point. Notice that even though we can draw the
solution curves, we may have no simple formula for them.
It can be shown that if the slope ﬁeld is continuous as we move from point to point in the
plane, we can be sure that a solution curve exists everywhere. Ensuring that each point has only one
solution curve through it requires a slightly stronger condition.

EULER’S METHOD
In the preceding section we saw how to sketch a solution curve to a differential equation using its
slope ﬁeld. In this section we compute points on a solution curve numerically using Euler’s method.
(Leonhard Euler was an eighteenth-century Swiss mathematician.) In Section 11.4 we ﬁnd formulas
for some solution curves.
Here’s the concept behind Euler’s method. Think of the slope ﬁeld as a set of signposts directing
you across the plane. Pick a starting point (corresponding to the initial value), and calculate the
slope at that point using the differential equation. This slope is a signpost telling you the direction
to take. Head off a small distance in that direction. Stop and look at the new signpost. Recalculate
the slope from the differential equation, using the coordinates of the new point. Change direction to
correspond to the new slope, and move another small distance, and so on.

Chapter Eleven DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
Example 1
Use Euler’s method for dy/dx = y. Start at the point P0 = (0, 1) and take Δx = 0.1.
Solution
The slope at the point P0 = (0, 1) is dy/dx = 1. (See Figure 11.35.) As we move from P0 to P1, y
increases by Δy, where
Δy = (slope at P0)Δx = 1(0.1) = 0.1.
So we have
y-value at P1 = (y value at P0) + Δy = 1 + 0.1 = 1.1.

Figure 11.35: Euler’s approximate solution to
dy/dx = y
Thus the point P1 is (0.1, 1.1). Now, using the differential equation again, we see that
slope at P1 = 1.1,
so if we move to P2, then y changes by
Δy = (slope at P1)Δx = (1.1)(0.1) = 0.11.
This means
y-value at P2 = (y value at P1) + Δy = 1.1 + 0.11 = 1.21.
Thus P2 is (0.2, 1.21). Continuing gives the results in Table 11.2.
Since the solution curves of dy/dx = y are exponentials, they are concave up and bend upward
away from the line segments of the slope ﬁeld. Therefore, in this case, Euler’s method produces
y-values which are too small.
Notice that Euler’s method calculates approximate y-values for points on a solution curve; it
does not give a formula for y in terms of x.
Example 2
Show that Euler’s method for dy/dx = y starting at (0, 1) and using two steps with Δx = 0.05
gives y ≈1.1025 when x = 0.1.
Solution
At (0, 1), the slope is 1 and Δy = (1)(0.05) = 0.05, so new y = 1 + 0.05 = 1.05. At (0.05, 1.05),
the slope is 1.05 and Δy = (1.05)(0.05) = 0.0525, so new y = 1.05+0.0525 = 1.1025 at x = 0.1.
In general, dy/dx may be a function of both x and y. Euler’s method still works, as the next
example shows.

Example 3
Approximate four points on the solution curve to dy/dx = −x/y starting at (0, 1); use Δx = 0.1.

Solution
The results from Euler’s method are in Table 11.3, along with the y-values (to two decimals) calcu-
lated from the equation of the circle x2 + y2 = 1, which is the solution curve through (0, 1). Since
the curve is concave down, the approximate y-values are above the exact ones. (See Figure 11.36.)

The Accuracy of Euler’s Method
To improve the accuracy of Euler’s method, we choose a smaller step size, Δx. Let’s go back to the
differential equation dy/dx = y and compare the exact and approximate values for different Δx’s.
The exact solution going through the point (0, 1) is y = ex, so the exact values are calculated using
this function. (See Figure 11.37.) Where x = 0.1,
Exact y-value = e0.1 ≈1.1051709.
In Example 1 we had Δx = 0.1, and where x = 0.1,
Approximate y-value = 1.1,
so the error ≈0.005.
In Example 2 we decreased Δx to 0.05. After two steps, x = 0.1, and we had
Approximate y-value = 1.1025,
so error ≈0.00267.
Thus, it appears that halving the step size has approximately halved the error.

The error in using Euler’s method over a ﬁxed interval is Exact value −Approximate value.
If the number of steps used is n, the error is approximately proportional to 1/n.
Just as there are more accurate numerical integration methods than left and right Riemann sums,
there are more accurate methods than Euler’s for approximating solution curves. However, Euler’s
method is all we need.

SEPARATION OF VARIABLES
We have seen how to sketch solution curves of a differential equation using a slope ﬁeld and how to
calculate approximate numerical solutions. Now we see how to solve certain differential equations
analytically, ﬁnding an equation for the solution curve.
First, we look at a familiar example, the differential equation
dy
dx = −x
y ,
whose solution curves are the circles
x2 + y2 = C.
We can check that these circles are solutions by differentiation; the question now is how they were
obtained. The method of separation of variables works by putting all the x-values on one side of
the equation and all the y-values on the other, giving
y dy = −x dx.
We then integrate each side separately:
,
y dy = −
,
x dx,
y2
2 = −x2
2 + k.
This gives the circles we were expecting:
x2 + y2 = C
where C = 2k.
You might worry about whether it is legitimate to separate the dx and the dy. The reason it can
be done is explained at the end of this section.
Example 1
Using separation of variables, solve the differential equation:
dy
dx = ky.
Solution
Separating variables,
1
ydy = k dx,
and integrating,
, 1
y dy =
,
k dx,
gives
ln |y| = kx + C
for some constant C.
Solving for |y| leads to
|y| = ekx+C = ekxeC = Aekx
where A = eC, so A is positive. Thus
y = (±A)ekx = Bekx
where B = ±A, so B is any nonzero constant. Even though there’s no C leading to B = 0, we can
have B = 0 because y = 0 is a solution to the differential equation. We lost this solution when we
divided through by y at the ﬁrst step. Thus, the general solution is y = Bekx for any B.
The differential equation dy/dx = ky always leads to exponential growth (if k > 0) or expo-
nential decay (if k < 0). Graphs of solution curves for some ﬁxed k > 0 are in Figure 11.39. For
k < 0, the graphs are reﬂected in the y-axis.

For k > 0, ﬁnd and graph solutions of
dH

Solution
The slope ﬁeld in Figure 11.40 shows the qualitative behavior of the solutions. To ﬁnd the equation
of the solution curves, we separate variables and integrate:
,
1
H −20 dH = −
,
k dt.
This gives
ln |H −20| = −kt + C.
Solving for H leads to:
|H −20| = e−kt+C = e−kteC = Ae−kt
or
H −20 = (±A)e−kt = Be−kt
H = 20 + Be−kt.
Again, B = 0 also gives a solution. Graphs for k = 1 and B = −10, 0, 10, with t ≥0, are in
Figure 11.40.

This differential equation can be used to represent the temperature, H(t), in ◦C at time t of
a cup of water standing in a room at 20◦C. As Figure 11.40 shows, if the initial temperature is
10◦C, the water warms up; if the initial temperature is 30◦C, the water cools down. If the initial
temperature is 20◦C, the water remains 20◦C.

dt = 2P −2Pt
satisfying P = 5 when t = 0.

Chapter Eleven DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
Solution
Factoring the right-hand side gives
dP
dt = P(2 −2t).
Separating variables, we get
, dP
P =
,
(2 −2t) dt,
so
ln |P| = 2t −t2 + C.
Solving for P leads to
|P| = e2t−t2+C = eCe2t−t2 = Ae2t−t2
with A = eC, so A > 0. In addition, A = 0 gives a solution. Thus the general solution to the
differential equation is
P = Be2t−t2
for any B.
To ﬁnd the value of B, substitute P = 5 and t = 0 into the general solution, giving
5 = Be2·0−02 = B,
so
P = 5e2t−t2.
The graph of this function is in Figure 11.41. Since the solution can be rewritten as
P = 5e1−1+2t−t2 = 5e1e−1+2t−t2 = (5e)e−(t−1)2,
the graph has the same shape as the graph of y = e−t2, the bell-shaped curve of statistics. Here the
maximum, normally at t = 0, is shifted one unit to the right to t = 1.

Justification for Separation of Variables
Suppose a differential equation can be written in the form
dy
dx = g(x)f(y).
Provided f(y) ̸= 0, we write f(y) = 1/h(y), so the right-hand side can be thought of as a fraction,
dy
dx = g(x)
h(y).
If we multiply through by h(y), we get
h(y)dy
dx = g(x).
Thinking of y as a function of x, so y = y(x), and dy/dx = y′(x), we can rewrite the equation as
h(y(x)) · y′(x) = g(x).

The form of the integral on the left suggests that we use the substitution y = y(x). Since dy = y′(x) dx,

g(x) dx.
If we can ﬁnd antiderivatives of h and g, then this gives the equation of the solution curve.

g(x) dx
looks as though we have treated dy/dx as a fraction, cross-multiplied, and then integrated. Although
that’s not exactly what we have done, you may ﬁnd this a helpful way of remembering the method.
In fact, the dy/dx notation was introduced by Leibniz to allow shortcuts like this (more speciﬁcally,
to make the chain rule look like cancellation).

11.5
GROWTH AND DECAY
In this section we look at exponential growth and decay equations. Consider the population of
a region. If there is no immigration or emigration, the rate at which the population is changing is
often proportional to the population. In other words, the larger the population, the faster it is growing
because there are more people to have babies. If the population at time t is P and its continuous
growth rate is 2% per unit time, then we know
Rate of growth of population = 2%(Current population),
and we can write this as
dP
dt = 0.02P.
The 2% growth rate is called the relative growth rate to distinguish it from the absolute growth
rate, dP/dt. Notice they measure different quantities. Since
Relative growth rate = 2% = 1
P
dP
dt ,
the relative growth rate is a percent change per unit time, while
Absolute growth rate = Rate of change of population = dP
dt

610
Chapter Eleven DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
is a change in population per unit time.
We showed in Section 11.4 that since the equation dP/dt = 0.02P is of the form dP/dt = kP
for k = 0.02, it has solution
P = P0e0.02t.
Other processes are described by differential equations similar to that for population growth, but
with negative values for k. In summary, we have the following result from the preceding section:
Every solution to the equation
dP
dt = kP
can be written in the form
P = P0ekt,
where P0 is the value of P at t = 0, and k > 0 represents growth,
whereas k < 0 represents decay.
Recall that the doubling time of an exponentially growing quantity is the time required for it
to double. The half-life of an exponentially decaying quantity is the time required for half of it to
decay.
Continuously Compounded Interest
At a bank, continuous compounding means that interest is accrued at a rate that is a ﬁxed percentage
of the balance at that moment. Thus, the larger the balance, the faster interest is earned and the faster
the balance grows.
Example 1
A bank account earns interest continuously at a rate of 5% of the current balance per year. Assume
that the initial deposit is $1000 and that no other deposits or withdrawals are made.
(a) Write the differential equation satisﬁed by the balance in the account.
(b) Solve the differential equation and graph the solution.
Solution
(a) We are looking for B, the balance in the account in dollars, as a function of t, time in years.
Interest is being added to the account continuously at a rate of 5% of the balance at that moment.
Since no deposits or withdrawals are made, at any instant,
Rate balance increasing = Rate interest earned = 5%(Current balance),
which we write as
dB
dt = 0.05B.
This is the differential equation that describes the process. It does not involve the initial condi-
tion $1000 because the initial deposit does not affect the process by which interest is earned.
(b) Solving the differential equation by separation of variables gives
B = B0e0.05t,
where B0 is the value of B at t = 0, so B0 = 1000. Thus
B = 1000e0.05t

and this function is graphed in Figure 11.44.

Figure 11.44: Bank balance against time
The Difference Between Continuous and Annual Percentage Growth Rates
If P = P0(1 + r)t with t in years, we say that r is the annual growth rate, while if P = P0ekt, we
say that k is the continuous growth rate.
The constant k in the differential equation dP/dt = kP is not the annual growth rate, but the
continuous growth rate. In Example 1, with a continuous interest rate of 5%, we obtain a balance
of B = B0e0.05t, where time, t, is in years. At the end of one year the balance is B0e0.05. In
that one year, our balance has changed from B0 to B0e0.05, that is, by a factor of e0.05 = 1.0513.
Thus the annual growth rate is 5.13%. This is what the bank means when it says “5% compounded
continuously for an effective annual yield of 5.13%.” Since P0e0.05t = P0(1.0513)t, we have two
different ways to represent the same function.
Since most growth is measured over discrete time intervals, a continuous growth rate is an
idealized concept. A demographer who says a population is growing at the rate of 2% per year
usually means that after t years the population is P = P0(1.02)t. To ﬁnd the continuous growth
rate, k, we express the population as P = P0ekt. At the end of one year P = P0ek, so ek = 1.02.
Thus k = ln 1.02 ≈0.0198. The continuous growth rate, k = 1.98%, is close to the annual growth
rate of 2%, but it is not the same. Again, we have two different representations of the same function
since P0(1.02)t = P0e0.0198t.
Pollution in the Great Lakes
In the 1960s pollution in the Great Lakes became an issue of public concern. We set up a model for
how long it would take for the lakes to ﬂush themselves clean, assuming no further pollutants are
being dumped in the lakes.
Suppose Q is the total quantity of pollutant in a lake of volume V at time t. Suppose that clean
water is ﬂowing into the lake at a constant rate r and that water ﬂows out at the same rate. Assume
that the pollutant is evenly spread throughout the lake and that the clean water coming into the lake
immediately mixes with the rest of the water.
We investigate how Q varies with time. Since pollutants are being taken out of the lake but
not added, Q decreases, and the water leaving the lake becomes less polluted, so the rate at which
the pollutants leave decreases. This tells us that Q is decreasing and concave up. In addition, the
pollutants are never completely removed from the lake though the quantity remaining becomes
arbitrarily small: in other words, Q is asymptotic to the t-axis. (See Figure 11.45.)
Setting Up a Differential Equation for the Pollution
To model exactly how Q changes with time, we write an equation for the rate at which Q changes.
We know that

0.46 × 103 Q = −0.38Q
where t is measured in years. Thus Q is given by
Q = Q0e−0.38t.
When 90% of the pollution has been removed, 10% remains, so Q = 0.1Q0. Substituting gives
0.1Q0 = Q0e−0.38t.

Newton’s Law of Heating and Cooling
Newton proposed that the temperature of a hot object decreases at a rate proportional to the differ-
ence between its temperature and that of its surroundings. Similarly, a cold object heats up at a rate
proportional to the temperature difference between the object and its surroundings.
For example, a hot cup of coffee standing on the kitchen table cools at a rate proportional
to the temperature difference between the coffee and the surrounding air. As the coffee cools, the
rate at which it cools decreases because the temperature difference between the coffee and the air
decreases. In the long run, the rate of cooling tends to zero, and the temperature of the coffee
approaches room temperature. See Figure 11.46.

Example 3
When a murder is committed, the body, originally at 37◦C, cools according to Newton’s Law of
Cooling. Suppose that after two hours the temperature is 35◦C and that the temperature of the
surrounding air is a constant 20◦C.
(a) Find the temperature, H, of the body as a function of t, the time in hours since the murder was
committed.
(b) Sketch a graph of temperature against time.
(c) What happens to the temperature in the long run? Show this on the graph and algebraically.
(d) If the body is found at 4 pm at a temperature of 30◦C, when was the murder committed?
Solution
(a) We ﬁrst ﬁnd a differential equation for the temperature of the body as a function of time. New-
ton’s Law of Cooling says that for some constant α,
Rate of change of temperature = α(Temperature difference).
If H is the temperature of the body, then
Temperature difference = H −20,
so
dH
dt = α(H −20).

614
Chapter Eleven DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
What about the sign of α? If the temperature difference is positive (i.e., H > 20), then H is
falling, so the rate of change must be negative. Thus α should be negative, so we write:
dH
dt = −k(H −20),
for some k > 0.
Separating variables and solving, as in Example 2 on page 605, gives:
H −20 = Be−kt.
To ﬁnd B, substitute the initial condition that H = 37 when t = 0:
37 −20 = Be−k(0) = B,
so B = 17. Thus,
H −20 = 17e−kt.
To ﬁnd k, we use the fact that after 2 hours, the temperature is 35◦C, so
35 −20 = 17e−k(2).
Dividing by 17 and taking natural logs, we get:
ln
15
17

= ln(e−2k)
−0.125 = −2k
k ≈0.063.
Therefore, the temperature is given by
H −20 = 17e−0.063t
or
H = 20 + 17e−0.063t.
(b) The graph of H = 20 + 17e−0.063t has a vertical intercept of H = 37 because the temperature
of the body starts at 37◦C. The temperature decays exponentially with H = 20 as the horizontal
asymptote. (See Figure 11.47.)

11.5 GROWTH AND DECAY
615
Taking natural logs:
−0.531 = −0.063t,
which gives
t ≈8.4 hours.
Thus the murder must have been committed about 8.4 hours before 4 pm. Since 8.4 hours
= 8 hours 24 minutes, the murder was committed at about 7:30 am.
Equilibrium Solutions
Figure 11.48 shows the temperature of several objects in a 20◦C room. One is initially hotter than
20◦C and cools down toward 20◦C; another is initially cooler and warms up toward 20◦C. All these
curves are solutions to the differential equation
dH
dt = −k(H −20)
for some ﬁxed k > 0, and all the solutions have the form
H = 20 + Ae−kt
for some A. Notice that H →20 as t →∞because e−kt →0 as t →∞. In other words, in the
long run, the temperature of the object always tends toward 20◦C, the temperature of the room. This
means that what happens in the long run is independent of the initial condition.
In the special case when A = 0, we have the equilibrium solution
H = 20
for all t. This means that if the object starts at 20◦C, it remains at 20◦C for all time. Notice that such
a solution can be found directly from the differential equation by solving dH/dt = 0:
dH
dt = −k(H −20) = 0
giving
H = 20.
Regardless of the initial temperature, H always gets closer and closer to 20 as t →∞. As a
result, H = 20 is called a stable equilibrium4 for H.

for some ﬁxed k > 0. Solving dB/dt = 0 gives the equilibrium B = 10, which is unstable because
if B starts near 10, it moves away as t →∞.
In general, we have the following deﬁnitions.
4In more advanced work, this behavior is described as asymptotic stability.

616
Chapter Eleven DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
• An equilibrium solution is constant for all values of the independent variable. The graph
is a horizontal line.
• An equilibrium is stable if a small change in the initial conditions gives a solution that
tends toward the equilibrium as the independent variable tends to positive inﬁnity.
• An equilibrium is unstable if a small change in the initial conditions gives a solution
curve that veers away from the equilibrium as the independent variable tends to positive
inﬁnity.
Solutions that do not veer away from an equilibrium solution are also called stable. If the
differential equation is of the form y′ = f(y), equilibrium solutions can be found by setting y′ to
zero.
Example 4
Find the equilibrium solution to the differential equation dP/dt = −50+4P and determine whether
the equilibrium is stable or unstable.
Solution
In order to ﬁnd the equilibrium solution, we solve dP/dt = −50 + 4P = 0. Thus, we have one
equilibrium solution at P = 50/4 = 12.5. We can determine whether the equilibrium is stable or
unstable by analyzing the behavior of solutions with initial conditions near P = 12.5. For example,
the solution with initial value P = 13 has initial slope dP/dt = −50 + 4(13) = 2 > 0. Thus,
solutions above the equilibrium P = 12.5 will increase and move away from the equilibrium.
A solution with an initial value P = 12 has initial slope dP/dt = −50 + 4(12) = −2 < 0.
Thus, solutions that have an initial value less than P = 12.5 will decrease and veer away from the
equilibrium. Since a small change in the initial condition gives solutions that move away from the
equilibrium, P = 12.5 is an unstable equilibrium. Notice it is possible to ﬁnd equilibrium and study
their stability without ﬁnding a formula for the general solution to the differential equation.

APPLICATIONS AND MODELING
Much of this book involves functions that represent real processes, such as how the temperature of
a yam or the population of the US is changing with time. You may wonder where such functions
come from. In some cases, we ﬁt functions to experimental data by trial and error. In other cases, we
take a more theoretical approach, leading to a differential equation whose solution is the function
we want. In this section we give examples of the more theoretical approach.
How a Layer of Ice Forms
When ice forms on a lake, the water on the surface freezes ﬁrst. As heat from the water travels up
through the ice and is lost to the air, more ice is formed. The question we will consider is: How
thick is the layer of ice as a function of time? Since the thickness of the ice increases with time, the
thickness function is increasing. In addition, as the ice gets thicker, it insulates better. Therefore,
we expect the layer of ice to form more slowly as time goes on. Hence, the thickness function is
increasing at a decreasing rate, so its graph is concave down.
A Differential Equation for the Thickness of the Ice
To get more detailed information about the thickness function, we have to make some assumptions.
Suppose y represents the thickness of the ice as a function of time, t. Since the thicker the ice, the
longer it takes the heat to get through it, we will assume that the rate at which ice is formed is
inversely proportional to the thickness. In other words, we assume that for some constant k,
Rate thickness
is increasing
=

Thickness,
so
dy
dt = k
y
where
k > 0.
This differential equation enables us to ﬁnd a formula for y. Using separation of variables:
,
y dy =
,
k dt
y2
2 = kt + C.
If we measure time so that y = 0 when t = 0, then C = 0. Since y must be non-negative, we have
y =
√
2kt .
Graphs of y against t are in Figure 11.54. Notice that the larger y is, the more slowly y increases. In
addition, this model suggests that y increases indeﬁnitely as time passes. (Of course, the value of y
cannot increase beyond the depth of the lake.)

The Net Worth of a Company
In the preceding section, we saw an example in which money in a bank account was earning interest
(Example 1, page 610). Consider a company whose revenues are proportional to its net worth (like
interest on a bank account) but that must also make payroll payments. The question is: under what
circumstances does the company make money, and under what circumstances does it go bankrupt?
Common sense says that if the payroll exceeds the rate at which revenue is earned, the company
will eventually be in trouble, whereas if revenue exceeds payroll, the company should do well. We
assume that revenue is earned continuously and that payments are made continuously. (For a large
company, this is a good approximation.) We also assume that the only factors affecting net worth
are revenue and payroll.
Example 1
A company’s revenue is earned at a continuous annual rate of 5% of its net worth. At the same time,
the company’s payroll obligations amount to $200 million a year, paid out continuously.
(a) Write a differential equation that governs the net worth of the company, W million dollars.
(b) Solve the differential equation, assuming an initial net worth of W0 million dollars.
(c) Sketch the solution for W0 = 3000, 4000, and 5000.
Solution
First, let’s see what we can learn without writing a differential equation. For example, we can ask
if there is any initial net worth W0 that will exactly keep the net worth constant. If there’s such an
equilibrium, the rate at which revenue is earned must exactly balance the payments made, so
Rate revenue is earned
=
Rate payments are made.
If net worth is a constant W0, revenue is earned at a constant rate of 0.05W0 per year, so we have
0.05W0 = 200
giving
W0 = 4000.
Therefore, if the net worth starts at $4000 million, the revenue and payments are equal, and the net
worth remains constant. Therefore, $4000 million is an equilibrium solution.
Suppose, however, the initial net worth is above $4000 million. Then, the revenue earned is
more than the payroll expenses, and the net worth of the company increases, thereby increasing the
revenue still further. Thus the net worth increases more and more quickly. On the other hand, if
the initial net worth is below $4000 million, the revenue is not enough to meet the payments, and
the net worth of the company declines. This decreases the revenue, making the net worth decrease
still more quickly. The net worth will eventually go to zero, and the company goes bankrupt. See
Figure 11.55.

Chapter Eleven DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
(a) Now we set up a differential equation for the net worth, using the fact that
Rate net worth
is increasing
=

.
In millions of dollars per year, revenue is earned at a rate of 0.05W, and payments are made at
a rate of 200 per year, so for t in years,
dW
dt = 0.05W −200.
The equilibrium solution, W = 4000, is obtained by setting dW/dt = 0.
(b) We solve this equation by separation of variables. It is helpful to factor out 0.05 before separat-
ing, so that the W moves over to the left-hand side without a coefﬁcient:
dW
dt = 0.05(W −4000).
Separating and integrating gives
,
dW
W −4000 =
,
0.05 dt,
so
ln |W −4000| = 0.05t + C,
or
|W −4000| = e0.05t+C = eCe0.05t.
This means
W −4000 = Ae0.05t
where A = ±eC.
To ﬁnd A, we use the initial condition that W = W0 when t = 0:
W0 −4000 = Ae0 = A.
Substituting this value for A into W = 4000 + Ae0.05t gives
W = 4000 + (W0 −4000)e0.05t.
(c) If W0 = 4000, then W = 4000, the equilibrium solution.
If W0 = 5000, then W = 4000 + 1000e0.05t.
If W0 = 3000, then W = 4000 −1000e0.05t. Substituting t ≈27.7 gives W = 0, so the
company goes bankrupt in its twenty-eighth year. These solutions are shown in Figure 11.55.
Notice that if the net worth starts with W0 near, but not equal to, $4000 million, then W moves
further away. Thus, W = 4000 is an unstable equilibrium.
The Velocity of a Falling Body: Terminal Velocity
Think about the velocity of a sky-diver jumping out of a plane. When the sky-diver ﬁrst jumps,
his velocity is zero. The pull of gravity then makes his velocity increase. As the sky-diver speeds
up, the air resistance also increases. Since the air resistance partly balances the pull of gravity, the
force causing him to accelerate decreases. Thus, the velocity is an increasing function of time, but
it is increasing at a decreasing rate. The air resistance increases until it balances gravity, when the
sky-diver’s velocity levels off. Thus, we expect the the graph of velocity against time to be concave
down with a horizontal asymptote.
A Differential Equation: Air Resistance Proportional to Velocity
In order to compute the velocity function, we need to know exactly how air resistance depends
on velocity. To decide whether air resistance is, say, proportional to the velocity, or is some other
function of velocity, requires either lab experiments or a theoretical idea of how the air resistance is

created. We consider a very small object, such as a dust particle settling on a computer component
during manufacturing,9 and assume that air resistance is proportional to velocity. Thus, the net force
on the object is F = mg −kv, where mg is the gravitational force, which acts downward, and kv
is the air resistance, which acts upward, so k > 0. (See Figure 11.56.) Then, by Newton’s Second
Law of Motion,
Force = Mass · Acceleration,
we have
mg −kv = mdv

Compartmental Analysis: A Reservoir
Many processes can be modeled as a container with various solutions ﬂowing in and out—for ex-
ample, drugs given intravenously or the discharge of pollutants into a lake. We consider a city’s
water reservoir, fed partly by clean water from a spring and partly by run-off from the surrounding
land. In New England and many other areas with much snow in the winter, the run-off contains salt
that has been put on the roads to make them safe for driving. We consider the concentration of salt
in the reservoir. If there is no salt in the reservoir initially, the concentration builds up until the rate
at which the salt is entering into the reservoir balances the rate at which salt ﬂows out. If, on the
other hand, the reservoir starts with a great deal of salt in it, then initially, the rate at which the salt
is entering is less than the rate at which it is ﬂowing out, and the quantity of salt in the reservoir
decreases. In either case, the salt concentration levels off at an equilibrium value.
A Differential Equation for Salt Concentration
A water reservoir holds 100 million gallons of water and supplies a city with 1 million gallons a day.
The reservoir is partly reﬁlled by a spring that provides 0.9 million gallons a day, and the rest of the
water, 0.1 million gallons a day, comes from run-off from the surrounding land. The spring is clean,
but the run-off contains salt with a concentration of 0.0001 pound per gallon. There was no salt in
the reservoir initially, and the water is well mixed (that is, the outﬂow contains the concentration
of salt in the tank at that instant). We ﬁnd the concentration of salt in the reservoir as a function of
time.
It is important to distinguish between the total quantity, Q, of salt in pounds and the concentra-
tion, C, of salt in pounds/gallon where
Concentration = C = Quantity of salt
Volume of water =
Q
100 million
 lb

.
(The volume of the reservoir is 100 million gallons.) We will ﬁnd Q ﬁrst, and then C. We know that
Rate of change of
quantity of salt
= Rate salt entering −Rate salt leaving.
Salt is entering through the run-off of 0.1 million gallons per day, with each gallon containing 0.0001
pound of salt. Therefore,
Rate salt entering = Concentration · Volume per day

giving
A = −1000.
Thus
Q −1000 = −1000e−0.01t,

THE LOGISTIC MODEL
Oil prices have a signiﬁcant impact on the world’s economies. In the eighteen months preceding
July 2008, the price of oil more than doubled from about $60 a barrel to about $140 a barrel.11
The impact of the increase was signiﬁcant, from the auto industry, to family budgets, to how people
commute. Even the threat of a price hike can send stock markets tumbling.
Many reasons are suggested for the increase, but one fact is inescapable: there is a ﬁnite supply
of oil in the world. To fuel its expanding economy, the world consumes more oil each succeeding
year. This cannot go on indeﬁnitely. Economists and geologists are interested in estimating the
remaining oil reserves and the date at which annual oil production is expected to peak (that is, reach
a maximum).
US oil production has already peaked—and the date was predicted in advance. In 1956, geolo-
gist M. King Hubbert predicted that annual US oil production would peak some time in the period
1965–1970. Although many did not take his prediction seriously, US oil production did in fact peak
in 1970. The economic impact was blunted by the US’s increasing reliance on foreign oil.
In this section we introduce the logistic differential equation and use it, as Hubbert did, to pre-
dict the peak of US oil production.12 Problems 29–32 investigate the peak of world oil production.
The Logistic Model
The logistic differential equation describes growth subject to a limit. For oil, the limit is the total oil
reserves; for a population, the limit is the largest population that the environment can support; for
the spread of information or a disease, the limit is the number of people that could be affected. The
solution to this differential equation is the family of logistic functions introduced in Section 4.4.
Suppose P is growing logistically toward a limiting value of L, and the relative growth rate,
(1/P)dP/dt, is k when P = 0. In the exponential model, the relative growth rate remains constant
at k. But in the logistic model, the relative growth rate decreases linearly to 0 as P approaches L;
see Figure 11.61.

This equation was ﬁrst proposed as a model for population growth by the Belgian mathematician P.
F. Verhulst in the 1830s. In Verhulst’s model, L represents the carrying capacity of the environment,
which is determined by the supply of food and arable land along with the available technology.

Qualitative Solution to the Logistic Equation
Figure 11.62 shows the slope ﬁeld and characteristic sigmoid, or S-shaped, solution curve for the
logistic model. Notice that for each ﬁxed value of P, that is, along each horizontal line, the slopes
are constant because dP/dt depends only on P and not on t. The slopes are small near P = 0 and
near P = L; they are steepest around P = L/2. For P > L, the slopes are negative, so if the
population is above the carrying capacity, the population decreases.

We can locate the inﬂection point where the slope is greatest using Figure 11.63. This graph is
a parabola because dP/dt is a quadratic function of P. The horizontal intercepts are at P = 0 and
P = L, so the maximum, where the slope is greatest, is at P = L/2. Figure 11.63 also tells us that
for 0 < P < L/2, the slope dP/dt is positive and increasing, so the graph of P against t is concave
up. (See Figure 11.64.) For L/2 < P < L, the slope dP/dt is positive and decreasing, so the graph
of P is concave down. For P > L, the slope dP/dt is negative, so P is decreasing.

If P = 0 or P = L, there is an equilibrium solution. Figure 11.65 shows that P = 0 is an
unstable equilibrium because solutions which start near 0 move away. However, P = L is a stable
equilibrium.

the solution. However, the equation can be solved analytically by separating variables:

We ﬁnd A by substituting P = P0 when t = 0, which gives

Since (L −P)/P = (L/P) −1, we have

The parameter L represents the limiting value. The parameter k represents the relative growth
rate when P is small relative to L. The parameter A depends on the initial condition P0.
Peak Oil: US Production
We apply the logistic model to US oil production as Hubbert did in 1956. To make predictions, we
need the values of k and L. We calculate these values from the oil production data Hubbert had
available to him in the 1950s; see Table 11.5.
We deﬁne P to be the total amount of oil, in billions of barrels, produced in the US since 1859,
the year the ﬁrst oil well was built. See Table 11.5. With time, t, in years, dP/dt approximates the
annual oil production in billions of barrels per year. Peak oil production occurs when dP/dt is a
maximum.

The slope of the line is −k/L = −0.00036, so we have L = 0.0649/0.00036 = 180 billion
barrels of oil. Thus, the model predicts that the total oil reserves in the US (the total amount in the
ground before drilling started in 1859) were 180 billion barrels of oil.15

If we let t = 0 be 1950, then P0 = 40.9 billion barrels and A = (180 −40.9)/40.9 = 3.401.
The logistic function representing US oil production is
P =
180
1 + 3.401e−0.0649t.
Predicting Peak Oil Production
To predict, as Hubbert did, the year when annual US oil production would peak, we use the fact that
the maximum value for dP/dt occurs when P = L/2. We derive a formula for the peak year (used
again in Problems 29–32 to ﬁnd peak production in world oil). The crucial observation is that, at the
peak, the denominator of the expression for P must equal 2. Since
P = L
2 =
L
1 + Ae−kt ,
we have
Ae−kt = 1.
Using logarithms to solve the equation Ae−kt = 1, we get t = (1/k) ln A. Since A = (L−P0)/P0,
we see that the time to peak oil production is an example of the following result:
13Data from http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=MCRFPUS1&f=A. Accessed Feb, 2012.
14The line is a least-squares regression line.
15If the same analysis is repeated for other time periods, for example 1900–1950 or 1900–2000, the value for L varies
between 120 and 220 billion barrels, while the value of k varies between 0.060 and 0.075.

For a logistic function, the maximum value of dP/dt occurs when P = L/2, and

≈3 billion barrels.
The actual peak in US oil production was 3.5 billion barrels in 1970. Repeating the analysis using
other time periods gives peak oil years in the range 1965-1970, as Hubbert predicted.
Figure 11.67 shows annual US production data and the parabola predicting its peak around
1970. Figure 11.68 shows P as a logistic function of t, with the limiting value of P = 180 and
maximum production at P = 90. In fact, the ﬁrst major oil crisis hit the US in the 1970s, with
spiraling gas prices and long lines at service stations. The decline in US oil production since 1970
was partly mitigated by the opening of the Alaskan oil ﬁelds, which led to a second but lower peak
in 1985. However, the US has increasingly depended on foreign oil.
Although Hubbert’s predictions of the peak year proved to be accurate, extrapolation into the
future is risky. Figure 11.67 and Figure 11.68 show that since 1970, oil production has slowed,
though not as much as predicted.

Interestingly, Hubbert used the logistic model only to estimate k; for L, he relied on geological
studies. It is remarkable that using only annual oil production for 1930-1950, we get an estimate for
L that is in such close agreement with the geological estimates.
US Population Growth
The logistic equation is often used to model population growth. Table 11.6 gives the annual census
ﬁgures in millions for the US population from 1790 to 2010.16 Since we have the population, P(t),
of the US at ten-year intervals, we compute the relative growth rate using averages of estimates of
the form:
1
P
dP
dt
in 1860 =
1
P(1860) · P(1870) −P(1860)
10
.
(See Problem 19 for details.) If we focus on the period 1790–1940, a line ﬁtted to the scatterplot of
(1/P)dP/dt versus P has intercept k = 0.0317 and slope −k/L = −0.000165, so L ≈192. Thus
the differential equation modeling the US population during this period is

After 1940, the actual ﬁgures leave the logistic model in the dust. The model predicts an in-
crease of 9.9 million from 1950 to 1960 versus the actual change of 28 million. By 1970 the actual
population of 203.2 million exceeded the predicted limiting population of L = 192 million. The
unprecedented surge in US population between 1945 and 1965 is referred to as the baby boom.

11.7 THE LOGISTIC MODEL
637
In Problems 29–33, we analyze world oil production.20 When
annual world oil production peaks and starts to decline, major
economic restructuring will be needed. We investigate when
this slowdown is projected to occur.
29. We deﬁne P to be the total oil production worldwide
since 1859 in billions of barrels. In 1993, annual world
oil production was 22.0 billion barrels and the total pro-
duction was P = 724 billion barrels. In 2008, annual
production was 26.9 billion barrels and the total produc-
tion was P = 1100 billion barrels. Let t be time in years
since 1993.
(a) Estimate the rate of production, dP/dt, for 1993 and
2008.
(b) Estimate the relative growth rate, (1/P)(dP/dt),
for 1993 and 2008.
(c) Find an equation for the relative growth rate,
(1/P)(dP/dt), as a function of P, assuming that
the function is linear.
(d) Assuming that P increases logistically and that all
oil in the ground will ultimately be extracted, esti-
mate the world oil reserves in 1859 to the nearest
billion barrels.
(e) Write and solve the logistic differential equation
modeling P.
30. In Problem 29 we used a logistic function to model P,
total world oil production since 1859, as a function of
time, t, in years since 1993. Use this function to answer
the following questions:
(a) When does peak annual world oil production occur?
(b) Geologists have estimated world oil reserves to be
as high as 3500 billion barrels.21 When does peak
world oil production occur with this assumption?
(Assume k and P0 are unchanged.)
31. As in Problem 29, let P be total world oil production
since 1859. In 1998, annual world production was 24.4
billion barrels and total production was P = 841 billion
barrels. In 2003, annual production was 25.3 billion bar-
rels and total production was P = 964 billion barrels.
(a) Graph dP/dt versus P from Problem 29 and show
the data for 1998 and 2003. How well does the
model ﬁt the data?
(b) Graph the logistic function modeling worldwide oil
production (P versus t) from Problem 29 and show
the data for 1998 and 2003. How well does the
model ﬁt the data?
32. Use the logistic function obtained in Problem 29 to
model the growth of P, the total oil produced worldwide
in billions of barrels since 1859:
(a) Find the projected value of P for 2010.
(b) Estimate the annual world oil production during
2010.
(c) How much oil is projected to remain in the ground
in 2010?
(d) Compare the projected production in part (b) with
the actual ﬁgure of 26.9 billion barrels.
33. With P, the total oil produced worldwide since 1859, in
billions of barrels, modeled as a function of time t in
years since 1993 as in Problem 29:
(a) Predict the total quantity of oil produced by 2020.
(b) In what year does the model predict that only 300
billion barrels remain?
34. The total number of people infected with a virus often
grows like a logistic curve. Suppose that time, t, is in
weeks and that 10 people originally have the virus. In the
early stages, the number of people infected is increasing
exponentially with k = 1.78. In the long run, 5000 peo-
ple are infected.
(a) Find a logistic function to model the number of peo-
ple infected.
(b) Sketch a graph of your answer to part (a).
(c) Use your graph to estimate the length of time until
the rate at which people are becoming infected starts
to decrease. What is the vertical coordinate at this
point?
35. Policy makers are interested in modeling the spread of
information through a population. For example, agricul-
tural ministries use models to understand the spread of
technical innovations or new seed types through their
countries. Two models, based on how the information is
spread, follow. Assume the population is of a constant
size M.
(a) If the information is spread by mass media (TV, ra-
dio, newspapers), the rate at which information is
spread is believed to be proportional to the number
of people not having the information at that time.
Write a differential equation for the number of peo-
ple having the information by time t. Sketch a solu-
tion assuming that no one (except the mass media)
has the information initially.
(b) If the information is spread by word of mouth, the
rate of spread of information is believed to be pro-
portional to the product of the number of people who
know and the number who don’t. Write a differential
equation for the number of people having the infor-
mation by time t. Sketch the solution for the cases in
which
(i)
No one
(ii)
5% of the population
(iii)
75% of the population
knows initially. In each case, when is the informa-
tion spreading fastest?

38. The spread of a non-fatal disease through a population
of ﬁxed size M can be modeled as follows. The rate
that healthy people are infected, in people per day, is
proportional to the product of the numbers of healthy
and infected people. The constant of proportionality is
0.01/M. The rate of recovery, in people per day, is 0.009
times the number of people infected. Construct a differ-
ential equation that models the spread of the disease. As-
suming that initially only a small number of people are
infected, plot a graph of the number of infected people
against time. What fraction of the population is infected
in the long run?
39. Many organ pipes in old European churches are made
of tin. In cold climates such pipes can be affected with
tin pest, when the tin becomes brittle and crumbles into
a gray powder. This transformation can appear to take
place very suddenly because the presence of the gray
powder encourages the reaction to proceed. The rate of
the reaction is proportional to the product of the amount
of tin left and the quantity of gray powder, p, present at
time t. Assume that when metallic tin is converted to gray
powder, its mass does not change.
(a) Write a differential equation for p. Let the total
quantity of metallic tin present originally be B.
(b) Sketch a graph of the solution p = f(t) if there is a
small quantity of powder initially. How much metal-
lic tin has crumbled when it is crumbling fastest?
(c) Suppose there is no gray powder initially. (For exam-
ple, suppose the tin is completely new.) What does
this model predict will happen? How do you recon-
cile this with the fact that many organ pipes do get
tin pest?
40. The logistic model can be applied to a renewable re-
source that is harvested, like ﬁsh. If a fraction c of the

and the line dP/dt = cP.
(a) Show that there is an equilibrium at P = (k−c)L/k
and that the annual harvest is then H = c(k−c)L/k.
(b) If k and L are constant and the population is at
the equilibrium in part (a), show that the maximum
possible annual harvest is kL/4 and occurs when
c = k/2.
(c) How can the population and the annual harvest at

happens as c increases beyond k/2 toward k. (As-

41. Federal or state agencies control hunting and ﬁshing by
setting a quota on how many animals can be harvested
each season. Determining the appropriate quota means
achieving a balance between environmental concerns and
the interests of hunters and ﬁshers. For example, when a
June 8, 2007 decision by the Delaware Superior Court in-
validated a two-year moratorium on catching horseshoe
crabs, the Delaware Department of Natural Resources
and Environmental Control imposed instead an annual
quota of 100,000 on male horseshoe crabs. Environmen-
talists argued this would exacerbate a decrease in the pro-
tected Red Knot bird population that depends on the crab
for food. For a population P that satisﬁes the logistic

SYSTEMS OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
In Section 11.7 we modeled the growth of a single population over time. We now consider the
growth of two populations that interact, such as a population of sick people infecting the healthy
people around them. This involves not just one differential equation, but a system of two.
Diseases and Epidemics
Differential equations can be used to predict when an outbreak of a disease will become so severe
that it is called an epidemic23 and to decide what level of vaccination is necessary to prevent an
epidemic. Let’s consider a speciﬁc example.
Flu in a British Boarding School
In January 1978, 763 students returned to a boys’ boarding school after their winter vacation. A
week later, one boy developed the ﬂu, followed by two others the next day. By the end of the month,
nearly half the boys were sick. Most of the school had been affected by the time the epidemic was
over in mid-February.24
Being able to predict how many people will get sick, and when, is an important step toward con-
trolling an epidemic. This is one of the responsibilities of Britain’s Communicable Disease Surveil-
lance Centre and the US’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
23Exactly when a disease should be called an epidemic is not always clear. The medical profession generally classiﬁes
a disease an epidemic when the frequency is higher than usually expected—leaving open the question of what is usually
expected. See, for example, Epidemiology in Medicine by C. H. Hennekens and J. Buring (Boston: Little, Brown, 1987).
24Data from the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre (UK); reported in “Inﬂuenza in a Boarding School,” British
Medical Journal, March 4, 1978, and by J. D. Murray in Mathematical Biology (New York: Springer Verlag, 1990).

Chapter Eleven DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
The S-I-R Model
We apply one of the most commonly used models for an epidemic, called the S-I-R model, to the
boarding school ﬂu example. The population of the school is divided into three groups:
S = the number of susceptibles, the people who are not yet sick
but who could become sick
I = the number of infecteds, the people who are currently sick
R = the number of recovered, or removed, the people who have
been sick and can no longer infect others or be reinfected.
The number of susceptibles decreases with time as people become infected. We assume that the
rate at which people become infected is proportional to the number of contacts between susceptible
and infected people. We expect the number of contacts between the two groups to be proportional
to both S and I. (If S doubles, we expect the number of contacts to double; similarly, if I dou-
bles, we expect the number of contacts to double.) Thus we assume that the number of contacts is
proportional to the product, SI. In other words, we assume that for some constant a > 0,
dS
dt = −

Rate susceptibles
get sick

= −aSI.
(The negative sign is used because S is decreasing.)
The number of infecteds is changing in two ways: newly sick people are added to the infected
group, and others are removed. The newly sick people are exactly those people leaving the suscep-
tible group and so accrue at a rate of aSI (with a positive sign this time). People leave the infected
group either because they recover (or die), or because they are physically removed from the rest of
the group and can no longer infect others. We assume that people are removed at a rate proportional
to the number of sick, or bI, where b is a positive constant. Thus,
dI
dt =
Rate susceptibles
get sick
−
Rate infecteds
get removed
= aSI −bI.
Assuming that those who have recovered from the disease are no longer susceptible, the recov-
ered group increases at the rate of bI, so
dR
dt = bI.
We are assuming that having the ﬂu confers immunity on a person, that is, that the person cannot
get the ﬂu again. (This is true for a given strain of ﬂu, at least in the short run.)
In analyzing the ﬂu, we can use the fact that the total population S + I + R is not changing.
(The total population, the total number of boys in the school, did not change during the epidemic.)
Thus, once we know S and I, we can calculate R. So we restrict our attention to the two equations
dS
dt = −aSI
dI
dt = aSI −bI.
The Constants a and b
The constant a measures how infectious the disease is—that is, how quickly it is transmitted from
the infecteds to the susceptibles. In the case of the ﬂu, we know from medical accounts that the
epidemic started with one sick boy, with two more becoming sick a day later. Thus, when I = 1 and

11.8 SYSTEMS OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
641
S = 762, we have dS/dt ≈−2, enabling us to roughly25 approximate a:
a = −dS/dt
SI
=
2
(762)(1) = 0.0026.
The constant b represents the rate at which infected people are removed from the infected
population. In this case of the ﬂu, boys were generally taken to the inﬁrmary within one or two days
of becoming sick. About half the infected population was removed each day, so we take b ≈0.5.
Thus, our equations are:
dS
dt = −0.0026SI
dI
dt = 0.0026SI −0.5I.
The Phase Plane
We can get a good idea of the progress of the disease from graphs. You might expect that we would
look for graphs of S and I against t, and eventually we will. However, we ﬁrst look at a graph of
I against S. If we plot a point (S, I) representing the number of susceptibles and the number of
infecteds at any moment in time, then, as the numbers of susceptibles and infecteds change, the
point moves. The SI-plane on which the point moves is called the phase plane. The path along
which the point moves is called the phase trajectory, or orbit, of the point.
To ﬁnd the phase trajectory, we need a differential equation relating S and I directly. Thinking
of I as a function of S, and S as a function of t, we use the chain rule to get
dI
dt = dI
dS · dS
dt ,
giving
dI
dS = dI/dt
dS/dt.
Substituting for dI/dt and dS/dt, we get
dI
dS = 0.0026SI −0.5I
−0.0026SI
.
Assuming I is not zero, this equation simpliﬁes to approximately
dI
dS = −1 + 192
S .
The slope ﬁeld of this differential equation is shown in Figure 11.76. The trajectory with initial
condition S0 = 762, I0 = 1 is shown in Figure 11.77. Time is represented by the arrow showing
the direction that a point moves on the trajectory. The disease starts at the point S0 = 762, I0 = 1.
At ﬁrst, more people become infected and fewer are susceptible. In other words, S decreases and I
increases. Later, I decreases as S continues to decrease.

Chapter Eleven DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
What Does the SI-Phase Plane Tell Us?
To learn how the disease progresses, look at the shape of the curve in Figure 11.77. The value of
I increases to about 300 (the maximum number infected and infectious at any one time); then I
decreases to zero. This peak value of I occurs when S ≈200. We can determine exactly when the
peak value occurs by solving
dI
dS = −1 + 192
S
= 0,
which gives
S = 192.
Notice that the peak value for I always occurs at the same value of S, namely S = 192. The
graph shows that if a trajectory starts with S0 > 192, then I ﬁrst increases and then decreases to
zero. On the other hand, if S0 < 192, there is no peak as I decreases right away.
For this example, the value S0 = 192 is called a threshold value. If S0 is around or below
192, there is no epidemic. If S0 is signiﬁcantly greater than 192, an epidemic occurs.26
The phase diagram makes clear that the maximum value of I is about 300. Another question
answered by the phase plane diagram is the total number of students who are expected to get sick
during the epidemic. (This is not the maximum value reached by I, which gives the maximum
number infected at any one time.) The point at which the trajectory crosses the S-axis represents
the time when the epidemic has passed (since I = 0). The S-intercept shows how many boys never
get the ﬂu and thus, how many do get it.
How Many People Should Be Vaccinated?
An epidemic can sometimes be avoided by vaccination. How many boys would have had to be
vaccinated to prevent the ﬂu epidemic? To answer this, think of vaccination as removing people from
the S category (without increasing I), which amounts to moving the initial point on the trajectory
to the left, parallel to the S-axis. To avoid an epidemic, the initial value of S0 should be at or below
the threshold value. Therefore, all but 192 boys would need to be vaccinated.
Graphs of S and I Against t
To ﬁnd out exactly when I reaches its maximum, we need numerical methods. A modiﬁcation of
Euler’s method was used to generate the solution curves of S and I against t in Figure 11.78. Notice
that the number of susceptibles drops throughout the disease as healthy people get sick. The number
of infecteds peaks after about 6 days and then drops. The epidemic has run its course in 20 days.
Analytical Solution for the SI-Phase Trajectory
The differential equation
dI
dS = −1 + 192
S
can be integrated, giving
I = −S + 192 lnS + C.
Using S0 = 762 and I0 = 1 gives 1 = −762 + 192 ln762 + C, so we get C = 763 −192 ln 762.
Substituting this value for C, we get:
I = −S + 192 lnS −192 ln 762 + 763
I = −S + 192 ln
 S

+ 763.
This is the equation of the solution curve in Figure 11.77.
26Here we are using J. D. Murray’s deﬁnition of an epidemic as an outbreak in which the number of infecteds increases
from the initial value, I0. See Mathematical Biology (New York: Springer Verlag, 1990).

Two Interacting Populations: Predator-Prey
We now consider two populations which interact. They may compete for food, one may prey on
the other, or they may enjoy a symbiotic relationship in which each helps the other. We model a
predator-prey system using the Lotka-Volterra equations.
Robins and Worms
Let’s look at an idealized case27 in which robins are the predators and worms are the prey. There
are r thousand robins and w million worms. If there were no robins, the worms would increase
exponentially according to the equation
dw
dt = aw
where a is a constant and a > 0.
If there were no worms, the robins would have no food and their population would decrease accord-
ing to the equation28
dr
dt = −br
where b is a constant and b > 0.
Now we account for the effect of the two populations on one another. Clearly, the presence of
the robins is bad for the worms, so
dw
dt = aw −Effect of robins on worms.
On the other hand, the robins do better with the worms around, so
dr
dt = −br + Effect of worms on robins.
How exactly do the two populations interact? Let’s assume the effect of one population on the other
is proportional to the number of “encounters.” (An encounter is when a robin eats a worm.) The
number of encounters is likely to be proportional to the product of the populations because the more
there are of either population, the more encounters there will be. So we assume
dw
dt = aw −cwr
and
dr
dt = −br + kwr,
where c and k are positive constants.
To analyze this system of equations, let’s look at the speciﬁc example with a = b = c = k = 1:
dw
dt = w −wr
and
dr
dt = −r + wr.
27Based on ideas from Thomas A. McMahon.
28You might criticize this assumption because it predicts that the number of robins will decay exponentially, rather than
die out in ﬁnite time.

644
Chapter Eleven DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
To visualize the solutions to these equations, we look for trajectories in the phase plane. First we
use the chain rule,
dr
dw = dr/dt
dw/dt,
to obtain
dr
dw = −r + wr
w −wr .
The Slope Field and Equilibrium Points
We can get an idea of what solutions of this equation look like from the slope ﬁeld in Figure 11.79.
At the point (1, 1) there is no slope drawn because at this point the rate of change of the worm
population with respect to time is zero:
dw
dt = 1 −(1)(1) = 0.
The rate of change of the robin population with respect to time is also zero:
dr
dt = −1 + (1)(1) = 0.
Thus dr/dw is undeﬁned. In terms of worms and robins, this means that if at some moment
w = 1 and r = 1 (that is, there are 1 million worms and 1 thousand robins), then w and r remain
constant forever. The point w = 1, r = 1 is therefore an equilibrium solution. The slope ﬁeld
suggests that there are no other equilibrium points except the origin.
At an equilibrium point, both w and r are constant, so
dw
dt = 0
and
dr
dt = 0.
Therefore, we look for equilibrium points by solving
dw
dt = w −wr = 0
and
dr
dt = −r + rw = 0,
which has w = 0, r = 0 and w = 1, r = 1 as the only solutions.

Trajectories in the wr-Phase Plane
Let’s look at the trajectories in the phase plane. Remember that a point on a curve represents a pair
of populations (w, r) existing at the same time t (though t is not shown on the graph). A short time
later, the pair of populations is represented by a nearby point. As time passes, the point traces out a
trajectory. The direction is marked on the curve by an arrow. (See Figure 11.80.)
How do we ﬁgure out which way to move on the trajectory? Approximating the solution nu-
merically shows that the trajectory is traversed counterclockwise. Alternatively, look at the original
pair of differential equations. At the point P0 in Figure 11.81, where w > 1 and r = 1,
dr
dt = −r + wr = −1 + w > 0.
Therefore, r is increasing, so the point is moving counterclockwise around the closed curve.
Now let’s think about why the solution curves are closed curves (that is, why they come back
and meet themselves). Notice that the slope ﬁeld is symmetric about the line w = r. We can conﬁrm
this by observing that interchanging w and r does not alter the differential equation for dr/dw. This
means that if we start at point P on the line w = r and travel once around the point (1, 1), we
arrive back at the same point P. The reason is that the second half of the path, from Q to P, is the
reﬂection of the ﬁrst half, from P to Q, in the line w = r. (See Figure 11.80.) If we did not end up
at P again, the second half of our path would have a different shape from the ﬁrst half.
The Populations as Functions of Time
The shape of the trajectories tells us how the populations vary with time. We start at t = 0 at the
point P0 in Figure 11.81. Then we move to P1 at time t1, to P2 at time t2, to P3 at time t3, and
so on. At time t4 we are back at P0, and the whole cycle repeats. Since the trajectory is a closed
curve, both populations oscillate periodically with the same period. The worms (the prey) are at
their maximum a quarter of a cycle before the robins. (See Figure 11.82.)

13. Humans vs Zombies29 is a game in which one player
starts as a zombie and turns human players into zombies
by tagging them. Zombies have to “eat” on a regular ba-
sis by tagging human players, or they die of starvation
and are out of the game. The game is usually played over
a period of about ﬁve days. If we let H represent the size
of the human population and Z represent the size of the
zombie population in the game, then, for constant param-
eters a, b, and c, we have:

How many worms are there at the time when the robin
population reaches its maximum?
21. On the same axes, graph w and r (the worm and the robin
populations) against time. Use initial values of 1.5 for w
and 1 for r. You may do this without units for t.
22. People on the island like robins so much that they de-
cide to import 200 robins all the way from England, to
increase the initial population from r = 2 to r = 2.2
when t = 0. Does this make sense? Why or why not?
23. Assume that w = 3 and r = 1 when t = 0. Do the num-

imum and minimum values of the robin population. Es-
timate the number of worms when the robin population
reaches its minimum.
The systems of differential equations in Problems 25–27
model the interaction of two populations x and y. In each case,
answer the following two questions:
(a) What kinds of interaction (symbiosis,30 competition,
predator-prey) do the equations describe?
29http://humansvszombies.org
30Symbiosis takes place when the interaction of two species beneﬁts both. An example is the pollination of plants by
insects.

For Problems 28–31, consider a conﬂict between two armies
of x and y soldiers, respectively. During World War I, F. W.
Lanchester assumed that if both armies are ﬁghting a conven-
tional battle within sight of one another, the rate at which sol-
diers in one army are put out of action (killed or wounded) is
proportional to the amount of ﬁre the other army can concen-
trate on them, which is in turn proportional to the number of
soldiers in the opposing army. Thus Lanchester assumed that
if there are no reinforcements and t represents time since the
start of the battle, then x and y obey the differential equations
dx
dt = −ay
dy
dt = −bx
a, b > 0.
28. Near the end of World War II a ﬁerce battle took place
between US and Japanese troops over the island of Iwo
Jima, off the coast of Japan. Applying Lanchester’s anal-
ysis to this battle, with x representing the number of US
troops and y the number of Japanese troops, it has been
estimated31 that a = 0.05 and b = 0.01.
(a) Using these values for a and b and ignoring rein-
forcements, write a differential equation involving
dy/dx and sketch its slope ﬁeld.
(b) Assuming that the initial strength of the US forces
was 54,000 and that of the Japanese was 21,500,
draw the trajectory which describes the battle. What
outcome is predicted? (That is, which side do the
differential equations predict will win?)
(c) Would knowing that the US in fact had 19,000 re-
inforcements, while the Japanese had none, alter the
outcome predicted?
29. (a) For two armies of strengths x and y ﬁghting a con-
ventional battle governed by Lanchester’s differen-
tial equations, write a differential equation involving
dy/dx and the constants of attrition a and b.
(b) Solve the differential equation and hence show that
the equation of the phase trajectory is
ay2 −bx2 = C
for some constant C. This equation is called Lanch-
ester’s square law. The value of C depends on the
initial sizes of the two armies.
30. Consider the battle of Iwo Jima, described in Problem 28.
Take a = 0.05, b = 0.01 and assume the initial strength
of the US troops to be 54,000 and that of the Japanese
troops to be 21,500. (Again, ignore reinforcements.)
(a) Using Lanchester’s square law derived in Prob-
lem 29, ﬁnd the equation of the trajectory describing
the battle.
(b) Assuming that the Japanese fought without surren-
dering until they had all been killed, as was the case,

ANALYZING THE PHASE PLANE
In the previous section we analyzed a system of differential equations using a slope ﬁeld. In this
section we analyze a system of differential equations using nullclines. We consider two species
having similar niches, or ways of living, and that are in competition for food and space. In such
cases, one species often becomes extinct. This phenomenon is called the Principle of Competitive
Exclusion. We see how differential equations predict this in a particular case.
Competitive Exclusion: Citrus Tree Parasites
The citrus farmers of Southern California are interested in controlling the insects that live on their
trees. Some of these insects can be controlled by parasites that live on the trees too. Scientists are,
therefore, interested in understanding under what circumstances these parasites ﬂourish or die out.
One such parasite was introduced accidentally from the Mediterranean; later, other parasites were
introduced from China and India; in each case the previous parasite became extinct over part of
its habitat. In 1963 a lab experiment was carried out to determine which one of a pair of species
became extinct when they were in competition with each other. The data on one pair of species,
called A. ﬁsheri and A. melinus, with populations P1 and P2 respectively, is given in Table 11.8 and
shows that A. melinus (P2) became extinct after 8 generations.32

Data from the same experimenters indicates that, when alone, each population grows logisti-
cally. In fact, their data suggests that, when alone, the population of P1 might grow according to the
32Data adapted from Paul DeBach and Ragnhild Sundby, “Competitive Displacement Between Ecological Homologues,”

and when alone, the population of P2 might grow according to the equation
dP2
dt = 0.09P2


.
Now suppose both parasites are present. Each tends to reduce the growth rate of the other, so each
differential equation is modiﬁed by subtracting a term on the right. The experimental data shows
that together P1 and P2 can be well described by the equations
dP1
dt = 0.05P1

−0.15P1P2.
The fact that P2 dies out with time is reﬂected in these equations: the coefﬁcient of P1P2 is
much larger in the equation for P2 than in the equation for P1. This indicates that the interaction has
a much more devastating effect upon the growth of P2 than on the growth of P1.
The Phase Plane and Nullclines
We consider the phase plane with the P1 axis horizontal and the P2 axis vertical. To ﬁnd the trajec-
tories in the P1P2 phase plane, we could draw a slope ﬁeld as in the previous section. Instead, we
use a method that gives a good qualitative picture of the behavior of the trajectories even without a
calculator or computer. We ﬁnd the nullclines or curves along which dP1/dt = 0 or dP2/dt = 0.
At points where dP2/dt = 0, the population P2 is momentarily constant, so only population P1 is
changing with time. Therefore, at this point the trajectory is horizontal. (See Figure 11.86.) Simi-
larly, at points where dP1/dt = 0, the population P1 is momentarily constant and population P2
is the only one changing, so the trajectory is vertical there. A point where both dP1/dt = 0 and
dP2/dt = 0 is called an equilibrium point because P1 and P2 both remain constant if they reach
these values.

11.9 ANALYZING THE PHASE PLANE
651
On the P1P2 phase plane:
• If dP1
dt = 0, the trajectory is vertical.
• If dP2
dt = 0, the trajectory is horizontal.
• If dP1
dt = dP2
dt = 0, there is an equilibrium point.
Using Nullclines to Analyze the Parasite Populations
In order to see where dP1/dt = 0 or dP2/dt = 0, we factor the right side of our differential
equations:
dP1
dt = 0.05P1

1 −P1
20

−0.002P1P2 = 0.001P1(50 −2.5P1 −2P2)
dP2
dt = 0.09P2

1 −P2
15

−0.15P1P2 = 0.001P2(90 −150P1 −6P2).
Thus dP1/dt = 0 where P1 = 0 or where 50 −2.5P1 −2P2 = 0. Graphing these equations in the
phase plane gives two lines, which are nullclines. Since the trajectory is vertical where dP1/dt = 0,
in Figure 11.87 we draw small vertical line segments on these nullclines to represent the direction
of the trajectories as they cross the nullcline. Similarly dP2/dt = 0 where P2 = 0 or where 90 −
150P1 −6P2 = 0. These equations are graphed in Figure 11.87 with small horizontal line segments
on them.
The equilibrium points are where both dP1/dt = 0 and dP2/dt = 0, namely the points P1 =
0, P2 = 0 (meaning that both species die out); P1 = 0, P2 = 15 (where P1 is extinct); and P1 =
20, P2 = 0 (where P2 is extinct).
What Happens in the Regions Between the Nullclines?
Nullclines are useful because they divide the plane into regions in which the signs of dP1/dt and
dP2/dt are constant. In each region, the direction of every trajectory remains roughly the same.
In Region I, for example, we might try the point P1 = 20, P2 = 25. Then
dP1
dt = 0.001(20)(50 −2.5(20) −2(25)) < 0
dP2
dt = 0.001(25)(90 −150(20) −6(25)) < 0.

Now dP1/dt < 0, so P1 is decreasing, which can be represented by an arrow in the direction ←.
Also, dP2/dt < 0, so P2 is decreasing, as represented by the arrow ↓. Combining these directions,
we know that the trajectories in this region go approximately in the diagonal direction

?

(See
Region I in Figure 11.87.)
In Region II, try, for example, P1 = 1, P2 = 1. Then we have
dP1
dt = 0.001(1)(50 −2.5 −2) > 0
dP2
dt = 0.001(1)(90 −150 −6) < 0.
So here, P1 is increasing while P2 is decreasing. (See Region II in Figure 11.87.)
In Region III, try P1 = 0.1, P2 = 0.1:
dP1
dt = 0.001(0.1)(50 −2.5(0.1) −2(0.1)) > 0
dP2
dt = 0.001(0.1)(90 −150(0.1) −6(0.1)) > 0.
So here, both P1 and P2 are increasing. (See Region III in Figure 11.87.)
Notice that the behavior of the populations in each region makes biological sense. In region
I both populations are so large that overpopulation is a problem, so both populations decrease. In
Region III both populations are so small that they are effectively not in competition, so both grow.
In Region II competition between the species comes into play. The fact that P1 increases while P2
decreases in Region II means that P1 wins.
Solution Trajectories
Suppose the system starts with some of each population. This means that the initial point of the
trajectory is not on one of the axes, and so it is in Region I, II, or III. Then the point moves on a
trajectory like one of those computed numerically and shown in Figure 11.88. Notice that all these
trajectories tend toward the point P1 = 20, P2 = 0, corresponding to a population of 20,000 for P1
and extinction for P2. Consequently, this model predicts that no matter what the initial populations
are, provided P1 ̸= 0, the population of P2 is excluded by P1, and P1 tends to a constant value. This
makes biological sense: in the absence of P2, we would expect P1 to settle down to the carrying
capacity of the niche, which is 20,000.

23. In the 1930s, the Soviet ecologist G. F. Gause performed
a series of experiments on competition among two yeasts
with populations P1 and P2, respectively. By perform-
ing population studies at low density in large volumes,
he determined what he called the coefﬁcients of geomet-
ric increase (and we would call continuous exponential
growth rates). These coefﬁcients described the growth of
each yeast alone:

where P1 and P2 are measured in units that Gause estab-

He also determined that, in his units, the carrying
capacity of P1 was 13 and the carrying capacity of P2
was 6. He then observed that one P2 occupies the niche
space of 3 P1 and that one P1 occupied the niche space
of 0.4 P2. This led him to the following differential equa-
tions to describe the interaction of P1 and P2:

54. When two countries are in an arms race, the rate at which
each one spends money on arms is determined by its own
current level of spending and by its opponent’s level of
spending. We expect that the more a country is already
spending on armaments, the less willing it will be to in-
crease its military expenditures. On the other hand, the
more a country’s opponent spends on armaments, the
more rapidly the country will arm. If $x billion is the
country’s yearly expenditure on arms, and $y billion is
its opponent’s, then the Richardson arms race model pro-
poses that x and y are determined by differential equa-
tions. Suppose that for some particular arms race the

1. Medical Case Study: Anaphylaxis37
During surgery, a patient’s blood pressure was observed to be dangerously low. One possi-
ble cause is a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. A diagnosis of anaphylaxis is based in
part on a blood test showing the elevation of the serum tryptase, a molecule released by allergic
cells. In anaphylaxis, the concentration of tryptase in the blood rises rapidly and then decays
back to baseline in a few hours.
However, low blood pressure from an entirely different cause (say from a heart problem)
can also lead to an elevation in tryptase. Before diagnosing anaphylaxis, the medical team
needs to make sure that the observed tryptase elevation is the result of an allergy problem, not a
heart problem. To do this, they need to know the peak level reached by the serum tryptase. The
normal range for the serum tryptase is 0–15 ng/ml (nanograms per milliliter). Mild to moderate
elevations from low blood pressure are common, but if the peak were three times the normal
maximum (that is, above 45 ng/ml), then a diagnosis of anaphylaxis would be made.
The surgeons who resuscitated this patient ran two blood tests to measure Tr, the serum
tryptase concentration; the results are in Table 11.12. Use the test results to estimate the peak
serum tryptase level at the time of surgery by making an assumption of ﬁrst-order kinetics:
the rate of tryptase decay, dTr/dt, is proportional to the concentration of tryptase, Tr. Did this
patient experience anaphylaxis?

The Spread of SARS
In the spring of 2003, SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) spread rapidly in several
Asian countries and Canada. Predicting the course of the disease—how many people would be
infected, how long it would last—was important to ofﬁcials trying to minimize the impact of the
disease.
2. SARS Predictions for Hong Kong
This project compares three predictions about the spread of SARS in Hong Kong. We
measure time, t, in days since March 17, 2003, the date the World Health Organization (WHO)

Kong by day t. On March 17, Hong Kong reported 95 cases.

Chapter Eleven DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
The constants in the three differential equations whose predictions are analyzed in this
project were determined using WHO data available in March 2003. We compare predictions
from the three models for June 12, 2003, the last day a new case was reported in Hong Kong.
(a)
(i) A Linear Model. Suppose P satisﬁes
dP
dt = 30.2,
with P(0) = 95.
Solve the differential equation and use your solution to predict the number of cases of
SARS in Hong Kong by June 12 (t = 87).
(ii) An Exponential Model. Suppose P satisﬁes
1
P
dP
dt = 0.12,
with P(0) = 95.
Solve the differential equation and use your solution to predict the number of cases of
SARS in Hong Kong by June 12 (t = 87).

1
P
dP
dt = 0.19 −0.0002P,
with P(0) = 95.
Solve the differential equation and use your solution to predict the number of cases of

(b)
(i) Comment on the June 12 predictions from the three models.
(ii) What do each of the three models in part (a) predict about the trend in the number of
new cases each day?
(iii) In May 2003, The Lancet published39 a graph like Figure 11.99. What trend do you
see in the data? What does this trend suggest about which model ﬁts the data best?
(c) Assume that the data follow a logistic model, which is the only one in part (a) to predict
that the total number of cases will level off:
(i) Use your answer to part (a) (iii) to predict the maximum number of SARS cases.
(ii) Assume that the data follow a logistic model, but not necessarily with the parameters
given in part (a) (iii). Use Figure 11.99 and the fact that there had been a total of 998
cases of SARS by April 10 to predict the maximum number of SARS cases.
(d) To see how well the three models worked in practice, plot the data in Table 11.13 and each
of the three solution curves from part (a).

Chapter Eleven DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
4. Pareto’s Law
In analyzing a society, sociologists are often interested in how incomes are distributed
through the society. Pareto’s law asserts that each society has a constant k such that the average
income of all people wealthier than you is k times your income (k > 1). If p(x) is the number
of people in the society with an income of x or above, we deﬁne Δp = p(x + Δx) −p(x), for
small Δx.
(a) Explain why the number of people with incomes between x and x + Δx is represented by
−Δp. Then show that the total amount of money earned by people with incomes between
x and x + Δx is approximated by −xΔp.
(b) Use Pareto’s law to show that the total amount of money earned by people with incomes
of x or above is kxp(x). Then show that the total amount of money earned by people with
incomes between x and x + Δx is approximated by −kpΔx −kxΔp.
(c) Using your answers to parts (a) and (b), show that p satisﬁes the differential equation
(1 −k)xp′ = kp.
(d) Solve this differential equation for p(x).
(e) Sketch a graph of p(x) for various values of k, some large and some near 1. How does the
value of k alter the shape of the graph?

12.1
FUNCTIONS OF TWO VARIABLES
Function Notation
Suppose you want to calculate your monthly payment on a ﬁve-year car loan; this depends on both
the amount of money you borrow and the interest rate. These quantities can vary separately: the loan
amount can change while the interest rate remains the same, or the interest rate can change while
the loan amount remains the same. To calculate your monthly payment you need to know both. If
the monthly payment is $m, the loan amount is $L, and the interest rate is r%, then we express the
fact that m is a function of L and r by writing:
m = f(L, r).
This is just like the function notation of one-variable calculus. The variable m is called the depen-
dent variable, and the variables L and r are called the independent variables. The letter f stands
for the function or rule that gives the value of m corresponding to given values of L and r.
A function of two variables can be represented graphically, numerically by a table of values, or
algebraically by a formula. In this section, we give examples of each.
Graphical Example: A Weather Map
Figure 12.1 shows a weather map from a newspaper. What information does it convey? It displays
the predicted high temperature, T , in degrees Fahrenheit (◦F), throughout the US on that day. The
curves on the map, called isotherms, separate the country into zones, according to whether T is in
the 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, or 100s. (Iso means same and therm means heat.) Notice that the isotherm
separating the 80s and 90s zones connects all the points where the temperature is exactly 90◦F.

Figure 12.1: Weather map showing predicted high temperatures, T , on a summer day
Example 1
Estimate the predicted value of T in Boise, Idaho; Topeka, Kansas; and Buffalo, New York.
Solution
Boise and Buffalo are in the 70s region, and Topeka is in the 80s region. Thus, the predicted tem-
perature in Boise and Buffalo is between 70 and 80 while the predicted temperature in Topeka is
between 80 and 90. In fact, we can say more. Although both Boise and Buffalo are in the 70s, Boise
is quite close to the T = 70 isotherm, whereas Buffalo is quite close to the T = 80 isotherm. So we

12.1 FUNCTIONS OF TWO VARIABLES
667
estimate the temperature to be in the low 70s in Boise and in the high 70s in Buffalo. Topeka is about
halfway between the T = 80 isotherm and the T = 90 isotherm. Thus, we guess the temperature in
Topeka to be in the mid-80s. In fact, the actual high temperatures for that day were 71◦F for Boise,
79◦F for Buffalo, and 86◦F for Topeka.
The predicted high temperature, T , illustrated by the weather map is a function of (that is,
depends on) two variables, often longitude and latitude, or miles east-west and miles north-south
of a ﬁxed point, say, Topeka. The weather map in Figure 12.1 is called a contour map or contour
diagram of that function. Section 12.2 shows another way of visualizing functions of two variables
using surfaces; Section 12.3 looks at contour maps in detail.
Numerical Example: Beef Consumption
Suppose you are a beef producer and you want to know how much beef people will buy. This
depends on how much money people have and on the price of beef. The consumption of beef, C (in
pounds per week per household) is a function of household income, I (in thousands of dollars per
year), and the price of beef, p (in dollars per pound). In function notation, we write:
C = f(I, p).
Table 12.1 contains values of this function. Values of p are shown across the top, values of I
are down the left side, and corresponding values of f(I, p) are given in the table.1 For example, to
ﬁnd the value of f(40, 3.50), we look in the row corresponding to I = 40 under p = 3.50, where
we ﬁnd the number 4.05. Thus,
f(40, 3.50) = 4.05.
This means that, on average, if a household’s income is $40,000 a year and the price of beef is
$3.50/lb, the family will buy 4.05 lbs of beef per week.

Notice how this differs from the table of values of a one-variable function, where one row or
one column is enough to list the values of the function. Here many rows and columns are needed
because the function has a value for every pair of values of the independent variables.
Algebraic Examples: Formulas
In both the weather map and beef consumption examples, there is no formula for the underlying
function. That is usually the case for functions representing real-life data. On the other hand, for
many idealized models in physics, engineering, or economics, there are exact formulas.

Example 2
Give a formula for the function M = f(B, t) where M is the amount of money in a bank account
t years after an initial investment of B dollars, if interest is accrued at a rate of 1.2% per year
compounded annually.
Solution
Annual compounding means that M increases by a factor of 1.012 every year, so
M = f(B, t) = B(1.012)t.
Example 3
A cylinder with closed ends has radius r and height h. If its volume is V and its surface area is A,
ﬁnd formulas for the functions V = f(r, h) and A = g(r, h).
Solution
Since the area of the circular base is πr2, we have
V = f(r, h) = Area of base · Height = πr2h.
The surface area of the side is the circumference of the bottom, 2πr, times the height h, giving
2πrh. Thus,
A = g(r, h) = 2 · Area of base + Area of side = 2πr2 + 2πrh.
A Tour of 3-Space
In Section 12.2 we see how to visualize a function of two variables as a surface in space. Now we
see how to locate points in three-dimensional space (3-space).
Imagine three coordinate axes meeting at the origin: a vertical axis, and two horizontal axes at
right angles to each other. (See Figure 12.2.) Think of the xy-plane as being horizontal, while the
z-axis extends vertically above and below the plane. The labels x, y, and z show which part of each
axis is positive; the other side is negative. We generally use right-handed axes in which looking
down the positive z-axis gives the usual view of the xy-plane. We specify a point in 3-space by
giving its coordinates (x, y, z) with respect to these axes. Think of the coordinates as instructions
telling you how to get to the point: start at the origin, go x units along the x-axis, then y units
in the direction parallel to the y-axis, and ﬁnally z units in the direction parallel to the z-axis. The
coordinates can be positive, zero or negative; a zero coordinate means “don’t move in this direction,”
and a negative coordinate means “go in the negative direction parallel to this axis.” For example, the
origin has coordinates (0, 0, 0), since we get there from the origin by doing nothing at all.

Example 4
Describe the position of the points with coordinates (1, 2, 3) and (0, 0, −1).
Solution
We get to the point (1, 2, 3) by starting at the origin, going 1 unit along the x-axis, 2 units in the
direction parallel to the y-axis, and 3 units up in the direction parallel to the z-axis. (See Figure 12.3.)
To get to (0, 0, −1), we don’t move at all in the x- and the y-direction, but move 1 unit in the
negative z-direction. So the point is on the negative z-axis. (See Figure 12.4.) You can check that
the position of the point is independent of the order of the x, y, and z displacements.
Example 5
You start at the origin, go along the y-axis a distance of 2 units in the positive direction, and then
move vertically upward a distance of 1 unit. What are the coordinates of your ﬁnal position?

12.1 FUNCTIONS OF TWO VARIABLES
669
Solution
You started at the point (0, 0, 0). When you went along the y-axis, your y-coordinate increased to 2.
Moving vertically increased your z-coordinate to 1; your x-coordinate did not change because you
did not move in the x-direction. So your ﬁnal coordinates are (0, 2, 1). (See Figure 12.5.)
x
y
z
(0, 2, 1)
Figure 12.5: The point (0, 2, 1) is reached by moving 2 along the y-axis and 1 upward
It is often helpful to picture a three-dimensional coordinate system in terms of a room. The
origin is a corner at ﬂoor level where two walls meet the ﬂoor. The z-axis is the vertical intersection
of the two walls; the x- and the y-axis are the intersections of each wall with the ﬂoor. Points with
negative coordinates lie behind a wall in the next room or below the ﬂoor.
Graphing Equations in 3-Space
We can graph an equation involving the variables x, y, and z in 3-space; such a graph is a picture of
all points (x, y, z) that satisfy the equation.
Example 6
What do the graphs of the equations z = 0, z = 3, and z = −1 look like?
Solution
To graph z = 0, we visualize the set of points whose z-coordinate is zero. If the z-coordinate is
0, then we must be at the same vertical level as the origin, that is, we are in the horizontal plane
containing the origin. So the graph of z = 0 is the middle plane in Figure 12.6. The graph of z = 3
is a plane parallel to the graph of z = 0, but three units above it. The graph of z = −1 is a plane
parallel to the graph of z = 0, but one unit below it.

The plane z = 0 contains the x- and the y-coordinate axis, and is called the xy-plane. There
are two other coordinate planes. The yz-plane contains both the y- and the z-axis, and the xz-plane
contains the x- and the z-axis. (See Figure 12.7.)

Example 7
Which of the points A = (1, −1, 0), B = (0, 3, 4), C = (2, 2, 1), and D = (0, −4, 0) lies closest to
the xz-plane? Which point lies on the y-axis?
Solution
The magnitude of the y-coordinate gives the distance to the xz-plane. The point A lies closest to
that plane, because it has the smallest y-coordinate in magnitude. To get to a point on the y-axis,
we move along the y-axis, but we don’t move at all in the x- or the z-direction. Thus, a point on the
y-axis has both its x- and z-coordinate equal to zero. The only point of the four that satisﬁes this is
D. (See Figure 12.8.)
In general, if a point has one of its coordinates equal to zero, it lies in one of the coordinate
planes. If a point has two of its coordinates equal to zero, it lies on one of the coordinate axes.

Example 8
You are 2 units below the xy-plane and in the yz-plane. What are your coordinates?
Solution
Since you are 2 units below the xy-plane, your z-coordinate is −2. Since you are in the yz-plane,
your x-coordinate is 0; your y-coordinate can be anything. Thus, you are at the point (0, y, −2).
The set of all such points forms a line parallel to the y-axis, 2 units below the xy-plane, and in the
yz-plane. (See Figure 12.9.)
Example 9
You are standing at the point (4, 5, 2), looking at the point (0.5, 0, 3). Are you looking up or down?
Solution
The point you are standing at has z-coordinate 2, whereas the point you are looking at has z-
coordinate 3; hence you are looking up.
Example 10
Imagine that the yz-plane in Figure 12.7 is a page of this book. Describe the region behind the page
algebraically.
Solution
The positive part of the x-axis pokes out of the page; moving in the positive x-direction brings you
out in front of the page. The region behind the page corresponds to negative values of x, so it is the
set of all points in 3-space satisfying the inequality x < 0.
Distance Between Two Points
In 2-space, the formula for the distance between two points (x, y) and (a, b) is given by
Distance =

(x −a)2 + (y −b)2.
The distance between two points (x, y, z) and (a, b, c) in 3-space is represented by PG in
Figure 12.10. The side PE is parallel to the x-axis, EF is parallel to the y-axis, and FG is parallel
to the z-axis.

Using Pythagoras’ theorem twice gives

Thus, a formula for the distance between the points (x, y, z) and (a, b, c) in 3-space is
Distance =

Example 13
Find an equation for a sphere of radius 1 with center at the origin.
Solution
The sphere consists of all points (x, y, z) whose distance from the origin is 1, that is, which satisfy
the equation

x2 + y2 + z2 = 1.
This is an equation for the sphere. If we square both sides we get the equation in the form
x2 + y2 + z2 = 1.
Note that this equation represents the surface of the sphere. The solid ball enclosed by the sphere is
represented by the inequality x2 + y2 + z2 ≤1.

GRAPHS AND SURFACES
The weather map on page 666 is one way of visualizing a function of two variables. In this section
we see how to visualize a function of two variables in another way, using a surface in 3-space.
Visualizing a Function of Two Variables Using a Graph
For a function of one variable, y = f(x), the graph of f is the set of all points (x, y) in 2-space such
that y = f(x). In general, these points lie on a curve in the plane. When a computer or calculator
graphs f, it approximates by plotting points in the xy-plane and joining consecutive points by line
segments. The more points, the better the approximation.
Now consider a function of two variables.
The graph of a function of two variables, f, is the set of all points (x, y, z) such that
z = f(x, y). In general, the graph of a function of two variables is a surface in 3-space.
Plotting the Graph of the Function f(x, y) = x2 + y2
To sketch the graph of f we connect points as for a function of one variable. We ﬁrst make a table
of values of f, such as in Table 12.3.

Now we plot points. For example, we plot (1, 2, 5) because f(1, 2) = 5 and we plot (0, 2, 4)
because f(0, 2) = 4. Then, we connect the points corresponding to the rows and columns in the
table. The result is called a wire-frame picture of the graph. Filling in between the wires gives a
surface. That is the way a computer drew the graphs in Figure 12.11 and 12.12. As more points are
plotted, we get the surface in Figure 12.13, called a paraboloid.
You should check to see if the sketches make sense. Notice that the graph goes through the
origin since (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0) satisﬁes z = x2 + y2. Observe that if x is held ﬁxed and y is
allowed to vary, the graph dips down and then goes back up, just like the entries in the rows of
Table 12.3. Similarly, if y is held ﬁxed and x is allowed to vary, the graph dips down and then goes
back up, just like the columns of Table 12.3.

New Graphs from Old
We can use the graph of a function to visualize the graphs of related functions.
Example 1
Let f(x, y) = x2 + y2. Describe in words the graphs of the following functions:
(a)
g(x, y) = x2 + y2 + 3,
(b)
h(x, y) = 5 −x2 −y2,
(c)
k(x, y) = x2 + (y −1)2.
Solution
We know from Figure 12.13 that the graph of f is a paraboloid, or bowl with its vertex at the origin.
From this we can work out what the graphs of g, h, and k will look like.
(a) The function g(x, y) = x2 +y2 +3 = f(x, y)+3, so the graph of g is the graph of f, but raised
by 3 units. See Figure 12.14.
(b) Since −x2 −y2 is the negative of x2 + y2, the graph of −x2 −y2 is a paraboloid opening
downward. Thus, the graph of h(x, y) = 5 −x2 −y2 = 5 −f(x, y) looks like a downward-
opening paraboloid with vertex at (0, 0, 5), as in Figure 12.15.
(c) The graph of k(x, y) = x2 +(y−1)2 = f(x, y−1) is a paraboloid with vertex at x = 0, y = 1,
since that is where k(x, y) = 0, as in Figure 12.16.

Example 2
Describe the graph of G(x, y) = e−(x2+y2). What symmetry does it have?
Solution
Since the exponential function is always positive, the graph lies entirely above the xy-plane. From
the graph of x2 + y2 we see that x2 + y2 is zero at the origin and gets larger as we move farther
from the origin in any direction. Thus, e−(x2+y2) is 1 at the origin, and gets smaller as we move
away from the origin in any direction. It can’t go below the xy-plane; instead it ﬂattens out, getting
closer and closer to the plane. We say the surface is asymptotic to the xy-plane. (See Figure 12.17.)

Now consider a point (x, y) on the circle x2 + y2 = r2. Since
G(x, y) = e−(x2+y2) = e−r2,
the value of the function G is the same at all points on this circle. Thus, we say the graph of G has
circular symmetry.
Cross-Sections and the Graph of a Function
We have seen that a good way to analyze a function of two variables is to let one variable vary while
the other is kept ﬁxed.
For a function f(x, y), the function we get by holding x ﬁxed and letting y vary is called a
cross-section of f with x ﬁxed. The graph of the cross-section of f(x, y) with x = c is the
curve, or cross-section, we get by intersecting the graph of f with the plane x = c. We deﬁne
a cross-section of f with y ﬁxed similarly.
For example, the cross-section of f(x, y) = x2 + y2 with x = 2 is f(2, y) = 4 + y2. The graph
of this cross-section is the curve we get by intersecting the graph of f with the plane perpendicular
to the x-axis at x = 2. (See Figure 12.18.)

Example 3
Describe the cross-sections of the function g(x, y) = x2 −y2 with y ﬁxed and then with x ﬁxed.
Use these cross-sections to describe the shape of the graph of g.
Solution
The cross-sections with y ﬁxed at y = b are given by
z = g(x, b) = x2 −b2.

12.2 GRAPHS AND SURFACES
677
Thus, each cross-section with y ﬁxed gives a parabola opening upward, with minimum z = −b2.
The cross-sections with x ﬁxed are of the form
z = g(a, y) = a2 −y2,
which are parabolas opening downward with a maximum of z = a2. (See Figures 12.21 and 12.22.)
The graph of g is shown in Figure 12.23. Notice the upward-opening parabolas in the x-direction
and the downward-opening parabolas in the y-direction. We say that the surface is saddle-shaped.

Linear Functions
Linear functions are central to single-variable calculus; they are equally important in multivariable
calculus. You may be able to guess the shape of the graph of a linear function of two variables. (It’s
a plane.) Let’s look at an example.
Example 4
Describe the graph of f(x, y) = 1 + x −y.
Solution
The plane x = a is vertical and parallel to the yz-plane. Thus, the cross-section with x = a is
the line z = 1 + a −y which slopes downward in the y-direction. Similarly, the plane y = b is
parallel to the xz-plane. Thus, the cross-section with y = b is the line z = 1 + x −b which slopes
upward in the x-direction. Since all the cross-sections are lines, you might expect the graph to be a
ﬂat plane, sloping down in the y-direction and up in the x-direction. This is indeed the case. (See
Figure 12.24.)

When One Variable is Missing: Cylinders
Suppose we graph an equation like z = x2 which has one variable missing. What does the surface
look like? Since y is missing from the equation, the cross-sections with y ﬁxed are all the same
parabola, z = x2. Letting y vary up and down the y-axis, this parabola sweeps out the trough-

shaped surface shown in Figure 12.25. The cross-sections with x ﬁxed are horizontal lines obtained
by cutting the surface by a plane perpendicular to the x-axis. This surface is called a parabolic
cylinder, because it is formed from a parabola in the same way that an ordinary cylinder is formed
from a circle; it has a parabolic cross-section instead of a circular one.

Example 5
Graph the equation x2 + y2 = 1 in 3-space.
Solution
Although the equation x2 + y2 = 1 does not represent a function, the surface representing it can be
graphed by the method used for z = x2. The graph of x2 + y2 = 1 in the xy-plane is a circle. Since
z does not appear in the equation, the intersection of the surface with any horizontal plane will be
the same circle x2 + y2 = 1. Thus, the surface is the cylinder shown in Figure 12.26.

CONTOUR DIAGRAMS
The surface which represents a function of two variables often gives a good idea of the function’s
general behavior—for example, whether it is increasing or decreasing as one of the variables in-
creases. However it is difﬁcult to read numerical values off a surface and it can be hard to see all
of the function’s behavior from a surface. Thus, functions of two variables are often represented by
contour diagrams like the weather map on page 666. Contour diagrams have the additional advan-
tage that they can be extended to functions of three variables.
Topographical Maps
One of the most common examples of a contour diagram is a topographical map like that shown in
Figure 12.32. It gives the elevation in the region and is a good way of getting an overall picture of the
terrain: where the mountains are, where the ﬂat areas are. Such topographical maps are frequently
colored green at the lower elevations and brown, red, or white at the higher elevations.

Chapter Twelve FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES
The curves on a topographical map that separate lower elevations from higher elevations are
called contour lines because they outline the contour or shape of the land.3 Because every point
along the same contour has the same elevation, contour lines are also called level curves or level
sets. The more closely spaced the contours, the steeper the terrain; the more widely spaced the
contours, the ﬂatter the terrain (provided, of course, that the elevation between contours varies by
a constant amount). Certain features have distinctive characteristics. A mountain peak is typically
surrounded by contour lines like those in Figure 12.33. A pass in a range of mountains may have
contours that look like Figure 12.34. A long valley has parallel contour lines indicating the rising
elevations on both sides of the valley (see Figure 12.35); a long ridge of mountains has the same type
of contour lines, only the elevations decrease on both sides of the ridge. Notice that the elevation
numbers on the contour lines are as important as the curves themselves. We usually draw contours
for equally spaced values of z.

Notice that two contours corresponding to different elevations cannot cross each other as shown
in Figure 12.36. If they did, the point of intersection of the two curves would have two different
elevations, which is impossible (assuming the terrain has no overhangs).
Corn Production
Contour maps can display information about a function of two variables without reference to a
surface. Consider the effect of weather conditions on US corn production. Figure 12.37 gives corn
production C = f(R, T ) as a function of the total rainfall, R, in inches, and average temperature,
T , in degrees Fahrenheit, during the growing season.4 At the present time, R = 15 inches and
T = 76◦F. Production is measured as a percentage of the present production; thus, the contour
through R = 15, T = 76, has value 100, that is, C = f(15, 76) = 100.
Example 1
Use Figure 12.37 to estimate f(18, 78) and f(12, 76) and interpret in terms of corn production.

12.3 CONTOUR DIAGRAMS
683
Solution
The point with R-coordinate 18 and T -coordinate 78 is on the contour C = 100, so f(18, 78) =
100. This means that if the annual rainfall were 18 inches and the temperature were 78◦F, the country
would produce about the same amount of corn as at present, although it would be wetter and warmer
than it is now.
The point with R-coordinate 12 and T -coordinate 76 is about halfway between the C = 80 and
the C = 90 contours, so f(12, 76) ≈85. This means that if the rainfall fell to 12 inches and the
temperature stayed at 76◦, then corn production would drop to about 85% of what it is now.
Example 2
Use Figure 12.37 to describe in words the cross-sections with T and R constant through the point
representing present conditions. Give a common-sense explanation of your answer.
Solution
To see what happens to corn production if the temperature stays ﬁxed at 76◦F but the rainfall
changes, look along the horizontal line T = 76. Starting from the present and moving left along
the line T = 76, the values on the contours decrease. In other words, if there is a drought, corn
production decreases. Conversely, as rainfall increases, that is, as we move from the present to the
right along the line T = 76, corn production increases, reaching a maximum of more than 110%
when R = 21, and then decreases (too much rainfall ﬂoods the ﬁelds).
If, instead, rainfall remains at the present value and temperature increases, we move up the
vertical line R = 15. Under these circumstances corn production decreases; a 2◦increase causes a
10% drop in production. This makes sense since hotter temperatures lead to greater evaporation and
hence drier conditions, even with rainfall constant at 15 inches. Similarly, a decrease in temperature
leads to a very slight increase in production, reaching a maximum of around 102% when T = 74,
followed by a decrease (the corn won’t grow if it is too cold).
Contour Diagrams and Graphs
Contour diagrams and graphs are two different ways of representing a function of two variables.
How do we go from one to the other? In the case of the topographical map, the contour diagram
was created by joining all the points at the same height on the surface and dropping the curve into
the xy-plane.
How do we go the other way? Suppose we wanted to plot the surface representing the corn
production function C = f(R, T ) given by the contour diagram in Figure 12.37. Along each contour
the function has a constant value; if we take each contour and lift it above the plane to a height equal
to this value, we get the surface in Figure 12.38.

Notice that the raised contours are the curves we get by slicing the surface horizontally. In
general, we have the following result:

684
Chapter Twelve FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES
Contour lines, or level curves, are obtained from a surface by slicing it with horizontal planes.
A contour diagram is a collection of level curves labeled with function values.
Finding Contours Algebraically
Algebraic equations for the contours of a function f are easy to ﬁnd if we have a formula for f(x, y).
Suppose the surface has equation
z = f(x, y).
A contour is obtained by slicing the surface with a horizontal plane with equation z = c. Thus, the
equation for the contour at height c is given by:
f(x, y) = c.
Example 3
Find equations for the contours of f(x, y) = x2 + y2 and draw a contour diagram for f. Relate the
contour diagram to the graph of f.
Solution
The contour at height c is given by
f(x, y) = x2 + y2 = c.
This is a contour only for c ≥0, For c > 0 it is a circle of radius √c. For c = 0, it is a single point
(the origin). Thus, the contours at an elevation of c = 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . are all circles centered at the
origin of radius 1,
√
2,
√
3, 2, . . .. The contour diagram is shown in Figure 12.39. The bowl–shaped
graph of f is shown in Figure 12.40. Notice that the graph of f gets steeper as we move further
away from the origin. This is reﬂected in the fact that the contours become more closely packed as
we move further from the origin; for example, the contours for c = 6 and c = 8 are closer together
than the contours for c = 2 and c = 4.

12.3 CONTOUR DIAGRAMS
685
Solution
The contour at level c is given by
f(x, y) =

x2 + y2 = c.
For c > 0 this is a circle, just as in the previous example, but here the radius is c instead of √c.
For c = 0, it is the origin. Thus, if the level c increases by 1, the radius of the contour increases by
1. This means the contours are equally spaced concentric circles (see Figure 12.41) which do not
become more closely packed further from the origin. Thus, the graph of f has the same constant
slope as we move away from the origin (see Figure 12.42), making it a cone rather than a bowl.

In both of the previous examples the level curves are concentric circles because the surfaces
have circular symmetry. Any function of two variables which depends only on the quantity (x2+y2)
has such symmetry: for example, G(x, y) = e−(x2+y2) or H(x, y) = sin(

x2 + y2).
Example 5
Draw a contour diagram for f(x, y) = 2x + 3y + 1.
Solution
The contour at level c has equation 2x + 3y + 1 = c. Rewriting this as y = −(2/3)x + (c −1)/3,
we see that the contours are parallel lines with slope −2/3. The y-intercept for the contour at level
c is (c −1)/3; each time c increases by 3, the y-intercept moves up by 1. The contour diagram is
shown in Figure 12.43.

Figure 12.44: Contour map of f(x, y) = x2 −y2
Solution
One striking feature of the values in Table 12.4 is the zeros along the diagonals. This occurs because
x2 −y2 = 0 along the lines y = x and y = −x. So the z = 0 contour consists of these two lines.
In the triangular region of the table that lies to the right of both diagonals, the entries are positive.
To the left of both diagonals, the entries are also positive. Thus, in the contour diagram, the positive
contours lie in the triangular regions to the right and left of the lines y = x and y = −x. Further,
the table shows that the numbers on the left are the same as the numbers on the right; thus, each
contour has two pieces, one on the left and one on the right. See Figure 12.44. As we move away
from the origin along the x-axis, we cross contours corresponding to successively larger values. On
the saddle-shaped graph of f(x, y) = x2 −y2 shown in Figure 12.45, this corresponds to climbing
out of the saddle along one of the ridges. Similarly, the negative contours occur in pairs in the top
and bottom triangular regions; the values get more and more negative as we go out along the y-axis.
This corresponds to descending from the saddle along the valleys that are submerged below the
xy-plane in Figure 12.45. Notice that we could also get the contour diagram by graphing the family
of hyperbolas x2 −y2 = 0, ±2, ±4, . . ..

Using Contour Diagrams: The Cobb-Douglas Production Function
Suppose you decide to expand your small printing business. Should you start a night shift and hire
more workers? Should you buy more expensive but faster computers which will enable the current
staff to keep up with the work? Or should you do some combination of the two?

12.3 CONTOUR DIAGRAMS
687
Obviously, the way such a decision is made in practice involves many other considerations—
such as whether you could get a suitably trained night shift, or whether there are any faster comput-
ers available. Nevertheless, you might model the quantity, P, of work produced by your business
as a function of two variables: your total number, N, of workers, and the total value, V , of your
equipment. What might the contour diagram of the production function look like?
Example 7
Explain why the contour diagram in Figure 12.46 does not model the behavior expected of the
production function, whereas the contour diagram in Figure 12.47 does.

Figure 12.47: Correct contours for
printing production
Solution
Look at Figure 12.46. Notice that the contour P = 1 intersects the N- and the V - axis, suggesting
that it is possible to produce work with no workers or with no equipment; this is unreasonable.
However, no contours in Figure 12.47 intersect either the N- or the V -axis.
In Figure 12.47, ﬁxing V and letting N increase corresponds to moving to the right, cross-
ing contours less and less frequently. Production increases more and more slowly because hiring
additional workers does little to boost production if the machines are already used to capacity.
Similarly, if we ﬁx N and let V increase, Figure 12.47 shows production increasing, but at a
decreasing rate. Buying machines without enough people to use them does not increase production
much. Thus Figure 12.47 ﬁts the expected behavior of the production function best.
Formula for a Production Function
Production functions are often approximated by formulas of the form
P = f(N, V ) = cN αV β
where P is the quantity produced and c, α, and β are positive constants, 0 < α < 1 and 0 < β < 1.
Example 8
Show that the contours of the function P = cN αV β have approximately the shape of the contours
in Figure 12.47.
Solution
The contours are the curves where P is equal to a constant value, say P0, that is, where
cN αV β = P0.
Solving for V we get
V =
P0
c
1/β
N −α/β.
Thus, V is a power function of N with a negative exponent, so its graph has the shape shown in
Figure 12.47.

688
Chapter Twelve FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES
The Cobb-Douglas Production Model
In 1928, Cobb and Douglas used a similar function to model the production of the entire US econ-
omy in the ﬁrst quarter of this century. Using government estimates of P, the total yearly production
between 1899 and 1922, of K, the total capital investment over the same period, and of L, the total
labor force, they found that P was well approximated by the Cobb-Douglas production function
P = 1.01L0.75K0.25.
This function turned out to model the US economy surprisingly well, both for the period on which
it was based, and for some time afterward.

Chapter Twelve FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES
12.4
LINEAR FUNCTIONS
What is a Linear Function of Two Variables?
Linear functions played a central role in one-variable calculus because many one-variable functions
have graphs that look like a line when we zoom in. In two-variable calculus, a linear function is one
whose graph is a plane. In Chapter 14, we see that many two-variable functions have graphs which
look like planes when we zoom in.
What Makes a Plane Flat?
What makes the graph of the function z = f(x, y) a plane? Linear functions of one variable have
straight line graphs because they have constant slope. On a plane, the situation is a bit more com-
plicated. If we walk around on a tilted plane, the slope is not always the same: it depends on the
direction in which we walk. However, at every point on the plane, the slope is the same as long as
we choose the same direction. If we walk parallel to the x-axis, we always ﬁnd ourselves walking
up or down with the same slope;6 the same is true if we walk parallel to the y-axis. In other words,
the slope ratios Δz/Δx (with y ﬁxed) and Δz/Δy (with x ﬁxed) are each constant.
Example 1
A plane cuts the z-axis at z = 5 and has slope 2 in the x-direction and slope −1 in the y-direction.
What is the equation of the plane?
Solution
Finding the equation of the plane means constructing a formula for the z-coordinate of the point on
the plane directly above the point (x, y) in the xy-plane. To get to that point start from the point
above the origin, where z = 5. Then walk x units in the x-direction. Since the slope in the x-
direction is 2, the height increases by 2x. Then walk y units in the y-direction; since the slope in the
y-direction is −1, the height decreases by y units. Since the height has changed by 2x −y units, the
z-coordinate is 5 + 2x −y. Thus, the equation for the plane is
z = 5 + 2x −y.
For any linear function, if we know its value at a point (x0, y0), its slope in the x-direction,
and its slope in the y-direction, then we can write the equation of the function. This is just like the
equation of a line in the one-variable case, except that there are two slopes instead of one.
If a plane has slope m in the x-direction, has slope n in the y-direction, and passes through
the point (x0, y0, z0), then its equation is
z = z0 + m(x −x0) + n(y −y0).
This plane is the graph of the linear function
f(x, y) = z0 + m(x −x0) + n(y −y0).
If we write c = z0 −mx0 −ny0, then we can write f(x, y) in the equivalent form
f(x, y) = c + mx + ny.
Just as in 2-space a line is determined by two points, so in 3-space a plane is determined by
three points, provided they do not lie on a line.
6To be precise, walking in a vertical plane parallel to the x-axis while rising or falling with the plane you are on.

12.4 LINEAR FUNCTIONS
695
Example 2
Find the equation of the plane passing through the points (1, 0, 1), (1, −1, 3), and (3, 0, −1).
Solution
The ﬁrst two points have the same x-coordinate, so we use them to ﬁnd the slope of the plane
in the y-direction. As the y-coordinate changes from 0 to −1, the z-coordinate changes from 1
to 3, so the slope in the y-direction is n = Δz/Δy = (3 −1)/(−1 −0) = −2. The ﬁrst and
third points have the same y-coordinate, so we use them to ﬁnd the slope in the x-direction; it is
m = Δz/Δx = (−1 −1)/(3 −1) = −1. Because the plane passes through (1, 0, 1), its equation is
z = 1 −(x −1) −2(y −0)
or
z = 2 −x −2y.
You should check that this equation is also satisﬁed by the points (1, −1, 3) and (3, 0, −1).
Example 2 was made easier by the fact that two of the points had the same x-coordinate and two
had the same y-coordinate. An alternative method, which works for any three points, is to substitute
the x, y, and z-values of each of the three points into the equation z = c + mx + ny. The resulting
three equations in c, m, n are then solved simultaneously.
Linear Functions from a Numerical Point of View
To avoid ﬂying planes with empty seats, airlines sell some tickets at full price and some at a discount.
Table 12.9 shows an airline’s revenue in dollars from tickets sold on a particular route, as a function
of the number of full-price tickets sold, f, and the number of discount tickets sold, d.

In every column, the revenue jumps by $15,800 for each extra 200 discount tickets. Thus, each
column is a linear function of the number of discount tickets sold. In addition, every column has the
same slope, 15,800/200 = 79 dollars/ticket. This is the price of a discount ticket. Similarly, each
row is a linear function and all the rows have the same slope, 239, which is the price in dollars of a
full-fare ticket. Thus, R is a linear function of f and d, given by:
R = 239f + 79d.
We have the following general result:
A linear function can be recognized from its table by the following features:
• Each row and each column is linear.
• All the rows have the same slope.
• All the columns have the same slope (although the slope of the rows and the slope of the
columns are generally different).

Solution
In the ﬁrst column the function decreases by 1 (from 0.5 to −0.5) as x goes from 2 to 3. Since
the function is linear, it must decrease by the same amount in the second column. So the missing
entry must be 1.5 −1 = 0.5. The slope of the function in the x-direction is −1. The slope in the
y-direction is 2, since in each row the function increases by 1 when y increases by 0.5. From the
table we get f(2, 1.5) = 0.5. Therefore, the formula is
f(x, y) = 0.5 −(x −2) + 2(y −1.5) = −0.5 −x + 2y.
What Does the Contour Diagram of a Linear Function Look Like?
The formula for the airline revenue function in Table 12.9 is R = 239f + 79d, where f is the
number of full-fares and d is the number of discount fares sold.
Notice that the contours of this function in Figure 12.65 are parallel straight lines. What is the
practical signiﬁcance of the slope of these contour lines? Consider the contour R = 100,000; that
means we are looking at combinations of ticket sales that yield $100,000 in revenue. If we move
down and to the right on the contour, the f-coordinate increases and the d-coordinate decreases,
so we sell more full-fares and fewer discount fares. This is because to receive a ﬁxed revenue of
$100,000, we must sell more full-fares if we sell fewer discount fares. The exact trade-off depends
on the slope of the contour; the diagram shows that each contour has a slope of about −3. This
means that for a ﬁxed revenue, we must sell three discount fares to replace one full-fare. This can
also be seen by comparing prices. Each full fare brings in $239; to earn the same amount in discount
fares we need to sell 239/79 ≈3.03 ≈3 fares. Since the price ratio is independent of how many of
each type of fare we sell, this slope remains constant over the whole contour map; thus, the contours
are all parallel straight lines.
Notice also that the contours are evenly spaced. Thus, no matter which contour we are on, a
ﬁxed increase in one of the variables causes the same increase in the value of the function. In terms
of revenue, no matter how many fares we have sold, an extra fare, whether full or discount, brings
the same revenue as before.

Example 4
Find the equation of the linear function whose contour diagram is in Figure 12.66.
Solution
Suppose we start at the origin on the z = 0 contour. Moving 2 units in the y-direction takes us to
the z = 6 contour; so the slope in the y-direction is Δz/Δy = 6/2 = 3. Similarly, a move of 2
in the x-direction from the origin takes us to the z = 2 contour, so the slope in the x-direction is
Δz/Δx = 2/2 = 1. Since f(0, 0) = 0, we have f(x, y) = x + 3y.

12.4 LINEAR FUNCTIONS

It is difﬁcult to graph a linear function by hand. One method
that works if the x, y, and z-intercepts are positive is to plot
the intercepts and join them by a triangle as shown in Fig-
ure 12.68; this shows the part of the plane in the octant where
x ≥0, y ≥0, z ≥0. If the intercepts are not all positive,
the same method works if the x, y, and z-axes are drawn from
a different perspective. Use this method to graph the linear
functions in Problems 25–28.

30. Each column of Table 12.11 is linear with the same slope,
m = Δz/Δx = 4/5. Each row is linear with the same
slope, n = Δz/Δy = 3/2. We now investigate the slope
obtained by moving through the table along lines that are
neither rows nor columns.
(a) Move down the diagonal of the table from the up-
per left corner (z = 3) to the lower right corner
(z = 31). What do you notice about the changes
in z? Now move diagonally from z = 6 to z = 27.
What do you notice about the changes in z now?
(b) Move in the table along a line right one step, up two
steps from z = 19 to z = 9. Then move in the same

tice about the changes in z?
(c) Show that Δz = mΔx + nΔy. Use this to explain
what you observed in parts (a) and (b).
31. If we hold y ﬁxed, that is we keep Δy = 0, and step in
the positive x-direction, we get the x-slope, m. If instead
we keep Δx = 0 and step in the positive y-direction, we
get the y-slope, n. Fix a step in which neither Δx = 0
nor Δy = 0. The slope in the Δx, Δy direction is

12.5
FUNCTIONS OF THREE VARIABLES
In applications of calculus, functions of any number of variables can arise. The density of matter in
the universe is a function of three variables, since it takes three numbers to specify a point in space.
Models of the US economy often use functions of ten or more variables. We need to be able to apply
calculus to functions of arbitrarily many variables.
One difﬁculty with functions of more than two variables is that it is hard to visualize them. The
graph of a function of one variable is a curve in 2-space, the graph of a function of two variables is
a surface in 3-space, so the graph of a function of three variables would be a solid in 4-space. Since
we can’t easily visualize 4-space, we won’t use the graphs of functions of three variables. On the
other hand, it is possible to draw contour diagrams for functions of three variables, only now the
contours are surfaces in 3-space.
Representing a Function of Three Variables Using a Family of Level Surfaces
A function of two variables, f(x, y), can be represented by a family of level curves of the form
f(x, y) = c for various values of the constant, c.
A level surface, or level set of a function of three variables, f(x, y, z), is a surface of the
form f(x, y, z) = c, where c is a constant. The function f can be represented by the family
of level surfaces obtained by allowing c to vary.
The value of the function, f, is constant on each level surface.
Example 1
The temperature, in ◦C, at a point (x, y, z) is given by T = f(x, y, z) = x2 + y2 + z2. What do the
level surfaces of the function f look like and what do they mean in terms of temperature?
Solution
The level surface corresponding to T = 100 is the set of all points where the temperature is 100◦C.
That is, where f(x, y, z) = 100, so
x2 + y2 + z2 = 100.

12.5 FUNCTIONS OF THREE VARIABLES
701
This is the equation of a sphere of radius 10, with center at the origin. Similarly, the level surface
corresponding to T = 200 is the sphere with radius
√
200. The other level surfaces are concentric
spheres. The temperature is constant on each sphere. We may view the temperature distribution
as a set of nested spheres, like concentric layers of an onion, each one labeled with a different
temperature, starting from low temperatures in the middle and getting hotter as we go out from the
center. (See Figure 12.69.) The level surfaces become more closely spaced as we move farther from
the origin because the temperature increases more rapidly the farther we get from the origin.

Figure 12.69: Level surfaces of T = f(x, y, z) = x2 + y2 + z2, each one having a constant temperature
Example 2
What do the level surfaces of f(x, y, z) = x2 + y2 and g(x, y, z) = z −y look like?
Solution
The level surface of f corresponding to the constant c is the surface consisting of all points satisfying
the equation
x2 + y2 = c.
Since there is no z-coordinate in the equation, z can take any value. For c > 0, this is a circular
cylinder of radius √c around the z-axis. The level surfaces are concentric cylinders; on the narrow
ones near the z-axis, f has small values; on the wider ones, f has larger values. See Figure 12.70.
The level surface of g corresponding to the constant c is the plane
z −y = c.
Since there is no x variable in the equation, these plane are parallel to the x-axis and cut the yz-plane
in the line z −y = c. See Figure 12.71.

Example 3
What do the level surfaces of f(x, y, z) = x2 + y2 −z2 look like?
Solution
In Section 12.3, we saw that the two-variable quadratic function g(x, y) = x2 −y2 has a saddle-
shaped graph and three types of contours. The contour equation x2 −y2 = c gives a hyperbola
opening right-left when c > 0, a hyperbola opening up-down when c < 0, and a pair of intersecting
lines when c = 0. Similarly, the three-variable quadratic function f(x, y, z) = x2 + y2 −z2 has
three types of level surfaces depending on the value of c in the equation x2 + y2 −z2 = c.

702
Chapter Twelve FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES
Suppose that c > 0, say c = 1. Rewrite the equation as x2 + y2 = z2 + 1 and think of what
happens as we cut the surface perpendicular to the z-axis by holding z ﬁxed. The result is a circle,
x2 + y2 = constant, of radius at least 1 (since the constant z2 + 1 ≥1). The circles get larger as z
gets larger. If we take the x = 0 cross-section instead, we get the hyperbola y2 −z2 = 1. The result
is shown in Figure 12.75, with a = b = c = 1.
Suppose instead c < 0, say c = −1. Then the horizontal cross-sections of x2 + y2 = z2 −1
are again circles except that the radii shrink to 0 at z = ±1 and between z = −1 and z = 1 there
are no cross-sections at all. The result is shown in Figure 12.76 with a = b = c = 1.
When c = 0, we get the equation x2 + y2 = z2. Again the horizontal cross-sections are circles,
this time with the radius shrinking down to exactly 0 when z = 0. The resulting surface, shown in
Figure 12.77 with a = b = c = 1, is the cone z =


the lower cone z = −

How Surfaces Can Represent Functions of Two Variables and Functions of Three Variables
You may have noticed that we have used surfaces to represent functions in two different ways. First,
we used a single surface to represent a two-variable function f(x, y). Second, we used a family of
level surfaces to represent a three-variable function g(x, y, z). These level surfaces have equation
g(x, y, z) = c.
What is the relation between these two uses of surfaces? For example, consider the function
f(x, y) = x2 + y2 + 3.
Deﬁne
g(x, y, z) = x2 + y2 + 3 −z
The points on the graph of f satisfy z = x2 + y2 + 3, so they also satisfy x2 + y2 + 3 −z = 0.
Thus the graph of f is the same as the level surface
g(x, y, z) = x2 + y2 + 3 −z = 0.
In general, we have the following result:
A single surface that is the graph of a two-variable function f(x, y) can be thought of as one
member of the family of level surfaces representing the three-variable function
g(x, y, z) = f(x, y) −z.
The graph of f is the level surface g = 0.
Conversely, a single level surface g(x, y, z) = c can be regarded as the graph of a function
f(x, y) if it is possible to solve for z. Sometimes the level surface is pieced together from the
graphs of two or more two-variable functions. For example, if g(x, y, z) = x2 + y2 + z2, then one
member of the family of level surfaces is the sphere
x2 + y2 + z2 = 1.
This equation deﬁnes z implicitly as a function of x and y. Solving it gives two functions
z =

1 −x2 −y2
and
z = −

1 −x2 −y2.
The graph of the ﬁrst function is the top half of the sphere and the graph of the second function is
the bottom half.

LIMITS AND CONTINUITY
The sheer face of Half Dome, in Yosemite National Park in California, was caused by glacial
activity during the Ice Age. (See Figure 12.83.) As we scale the rock from the west, the height of
the terrain rises abruptly by nearly 5000 feet from the valley ﬂoor, 2000 feet of it vertical.
If we consider the function h giving the height of the terrain above sea level in terms of lon-
gitude and latitude, then h has a discontinuity along the path at the base of the cliff of Half Dome.
Looking at the contour map of the region in Figure 12.84, we see that in most places a small change
in position results in a small change in height, except near the cliff. There, no matter how small a
step we take, we get a large change in height. (You can see how crowded the contours get near the
cliff; some end abruptly along the discontinuity.)
This geological feature illustrates the ideas of continuity and discontinuity. Roughly speaking,
a function is said to be continuous at a point if its values at places near the point are close to the
value at the point. If this is not the case, the function is said to be discontinuous.

Chapter Twelve FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES
The property of continuity is one that, practically speaking, we usually assume of the functions
we are studying. Informally,we expect (except under special circumstances) that values of a function
do not change drastically when making small changes to the input variables. Whenever we model a
one-variable function by an unbroken curve, we are making this assumption. Even when functions
come to us as tables of data, we usually make the assumption that the missing function values
between data points are close to the measured ones.
In this section we study limits and continuity a bit more formally in the context of functions
of several variables. For simplicity we study these concepts for functions of two variables, but our
discussion can be adapted to functions of three or more variables.
One can show that sums, products, and compositions of continuous functions are continuous,
while the quotient of two continuous functions is continuous everywhere the denominator function
is nonzero. Thus, each of the functions
cos(x2y),
ln(x2 + y2),
ex+y
x + y,
ln(sin(x2 + y2))
is continuous at all points (x, y) where it is deﬁned. As for functions of one variable, the graph of a
continuous function over an unbroken domain is unbroken—that is, the surface has no holes or rips
in it.

12.6 LIMITS AND CONTINUITY
707
Solution
(a) The graph and contour diagram of f in Figures 12.85 and 12.86 suggest that f is close to 0
when (x, y) is close to (0, 0). That is, the ﬁgures suggest that f is continuous at the point (0, 0);
the graph appears to have no rips or holes there.
However, the ﬁgures cannot tell us for sure whether f is continuous. To be certain we must
investigate the limit analytically, as is done in Example 2(a) on page 707.
(b) The graph of g and its contours near (0, 0) in Figure 12.87 and 12.88 suggest that g behaves
differently from f: The contours of g seem to “crash” at the origin and the graph rises rapidly
from 0 to 1 near (0, 0). Small changes in (x, y) near (0, 0) can yield large changes in g, so we
expect that g is not continuous at the point (0, 0). Again, a more precise analysis is given in
Example 2(b) on page 707.
The previous example suggests that continuity at a point depends on a function’s behavior near
the point. To study behavior near a point more carefully we need the idea of a limit of a function
of two variables. Suppose that f(x, y) is a function deﬁned on a set in 2-space, not necessarily
containing the point (a, b), but containing points (x, y) arbitrarily close to (a, b); suppose that L is
a number.
The function f has a limit L at the point (a, b), written
lim
(x,y)→(a,b) f(x, y) = L,
if f(x, y) is as close to L as we please whenever the distance from the point (x, y) to the
point (a, b) is sufﬁciently small, but not zero.
We deﬁne continuity for functions of two variables in the same way as for functions of one
variable:
A function f is continuous at the point (a, b) if
lim
(x,y)→(a,b) f(x, y) = f(a, b).
A function is continuous on a region R in the xy-plane if it is continuous at each point in R.
Thus, if f is continuous at the point (a, b), then f must be deﬁned at (a, b) and the limit,
lim(x,y)→(a,b) f(x, y), must exist and be equal to the value f(a, b). If a function is deﬁned at a point
(a, b) but is not continuous there, then we say that f is discontinuous at (a, b).
We now apply the deﬁnition of continuity to the functions in Example 1, showing that f is
continuous at (0, 0) and that g is discontinuous at (0, 0).
Example 2
Let f and g be the functions in Example 1. Use the deﬁnition of the limit to show that:
(a)
lim
(x,y)→(0,0) f(x, y) = 0
(b)
lim
(x,y)→(0,0) g(x, y) does not exist.
Solution
To investigate these limits of f and g, we consider values of these functions near, but not at, the
origin, where they are given by the formulas
f(x, y) =
x2y
x2 + y2
g(x, y) =
x2
x2 + y2 .
(a) The graph and contour diagram of f both suggest that lim(x,y)→(0,0) f(x, y) = 0. To use the
deﬁnition of the limit, we estimate |f(x, y) −L| with L = 0:
|f(x, y) −L| =

x2y
x2 + y2 −0
 =

x2
x2 + y2
 |y| ≤|y| ≤

x2 + y2.

708
Chapter Twelve FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES
Now

x2 + y2 is the distance from (x, y) to (0, 0). Thus, to make |f(x, y) −0| < 0.001,
for example, we need only require (x, y) be within 0.001 of (0, 0). More generally, for any
positive number u, no matter how small, we are sure that |f(x, y) −0| < u whenever (x, y) is
no farther than u from (0, 0). This is what we mean by saying that the difference |f(x, y) −0|
can be made as small as we wish by choosing the distance to be sufﬁciently small. Thus, we
conclude that
lim
(x,y)→(0,0) f(x, y) =
lim
(x,y)→(0,0)
x2y
x2 + y2 = 0.
Notice that since this limit equals f(0, 0), the function f is continuous at (0, 0).
(b) Although the formula deﬁning the function g looks similar to that of f, we saw in Example 1
that g’s behavior near the origin is quite different. If we consider points (x, 0) lying along the
x-axis near (0, 0), then the values g(x, 0) are equal to 1, while if we consider points (0, y) lying
along the y-axis near (0, 0), then the values g(0, y) are equal to 0. Thus, within any distance
(no matter how small) from the origin, there are points where g = 0 and points where g = 1.
Therefore the limit lim(x,y)→(0,0) g(x, y) does not exist, and thus g is not continuous at (0, 0).
While the notions of limit and continuity look formally the same for one- and two-variable
functions, they are somewhat more subtle in the multivariable case. The reason for this is that on the
line (1-space), we can approach a point from just two directions (left or right) but in 2-space there
are an inﬁnite number of ways to approach a given point.

1. Noise Levels at London’s Heathrow Airport
The measure used by the UK government to monitor aircraft noise is called the Loudness Equiv-
alent or Leq.8 This takes the sound energy from each aircraft in decibels or dB and averages
it over a 16-hour day for several months. Based on the ofﬁcial noise output of each aircraft
type and historical data on aircraft movements and ﬂight paths, the Leq is calculated for a wide
area around Heathrow Airport, London. The results are shown as noise contour maps such as
Figure 12.96, where contours are labeled in dB. The 57 dB contour is signiﬁcant since a major
study indicated that community annoyance generally becomes signiﬁcant at this noise level.
(a) Identify the position of the main runways at Heathrow and estimate the noise level in dB
on the runways.
(b) Planes prefer to take off and land facing into the wind. Using the fact that the wind is
generally from the west, explain the shape of the contours at the western and eastern ends
of the runways.
(c) In which direction does the sound level fall most rapidly? Explain.
(d) A sound can be measured by the physical intensity of the sound, L. The decibel measure of
the sound, B, is obtained from the ratio of the sound intensity, L, to a base intensity, L0:
B = 10 log10

The contour levels are show at 3 dB intervals. How do sound intensity levels (L) compare

contour map change?

DISPLACEMENT VECTORS
Suppose you are a pilot planning a ﬂight from Dallas to Pittsburgh. There are two things you must
know: the distance to be traveled (so you have enough fuel to make it) and in what direction to go (so
you don’t miss Pittsburgh). Both these quantities together specify the displacement or displacement
vector between the two cities.
The displacement vector from one point to another is an arrow with its tail at the ﬁrst point
and its tip at the second. The magnitude (or length) of the displacement vector is the dis-
tance between the points and is represented by the length of the arrow. The direction of the
displacement vector is the direction of the arrow.
Figure 13.1 shows a map with the displacement vectors from Dallas to Pittsburgh, from Albu-
querque to Oshkosh, and from Los Angeles to Buffalo, SD. These displacement vectors have the
same length and the same direction. We say that the displacement vectors between the corresponding
cities are the same, even though they do not coincide. In other words
Displacement vectors which point in the same direction and have the same magnitude are
considered to be the same, even if they do not coincide.

Notation and Terminology
The displacement vector is our ﬁrst example of a vector. Vectors have both magnitude and direction;
in comparison, a quantity speciﬁed only by a number, but no direction, is called a scalar.1 For
instance, the time taken by the ﬂight from Dallas to Pittsburgh is a scalar quantity. Displacement is
a vector since it requires both distance and direction to specify it.
In this book, vectors are written with an arrow over them, ⃗v , to distinguish them from scalars.
Other books use a bold v to denote a vector. We use the notation −−→
PQ to denote the displacement
vector from a point P to a point Q. The magnitude, or length, of a vector ⃗v is written ∥⃗v ∥.
Addition and Subtraction of Displacement Vectors
Suppose NASA commands a robot on Mars to move 75 meters in one direction and then 50 meters
in another direction. (See Figure 13.2.) Where does the robot end up? Suppose the displacements
are represented by the vectors ⃗v and ⃗w , respectively. Then the sum ⃗v + ⃗w gives the ﬁnal position.
1So named by W. R. Hamilton because they are merely numbers on the scale from −∞to ∞.

The sum, ⃗v + ⃗w , of two vectors ⃗v and ⃗w is the combined displacement resulting from ﬁrst
applying ⃗v and then ⃗w . (See Figure 13.3.) The sum ⃗w + ⃗v gives the same displacement.

Suppose two different robots start from the same location. One moves along a displacement
vector ⃗v and the second along a displacement vector ⃗w . What is the displacement vector, ⃗x , from
the ﬁrst robot to the second? (See Figure 13.4.) Since ⃗v + ⃗x = ⃗w , we deﬁne ⃗x to be the difference
⃗x = ⃗w −⃗v . In other words, ⃗w −⃗v gets you from the ﬁrst robot to the second.
The difference, ⃗w −⃗v , is the displacement vector that, when added to ⃗v , gives ⃗w . That is,
⃗w = ⃗v + (⃗w −⃗v ). (See Figure 13.4.)

If the robot ends up where it started, then its total displacement vector is the zero vector,⃗0 . The
zero vector has no direction.
The zero vector, ⃗0 , is a displacement vector with zero length.
Scalar Multiplication of Displacement Vectors
If ⃗v represents a displacement vector, the vector 2⃗v represents a displacement of twice the magni-
tude in the same direction as ⃗v . Similarly, −2⃗v represents a displacement of twice the magnitude
in the opposite direction. (See Figure 13.5.)

If λ is a scalar and ⃗v is a displacement vector, the scalar multiple of ⃗v by λ, written λ⃗v , is
the displacement vector with the following properties:
• The displacement vector λ⃗v is parallel to ⃗v , pointing in the same direction if λ > 0 and
in the opposite direction if λ < 0.
• The magnitude of λ⃗v is |λ| times the magnitude of ⃗v , that is, ∥λ⃗v ∥= |λ| ∥⃗v ∥.
Note that |λ| represents the absolute value of the scalar λ while ∥λ⃗v ∥represents the magnitude
of the vector λ⃗v .
Example 1
Explain why ⃗w −⃗v = ⃗w + (−1)⃗v .
Solution
The vector (−1)⃗v has the same magnitude as ⃗v , but points in the opposite direction. Figure 13.6
shows that the combined displacement ⃗w + (−1)⃗v is the same as the displacement ⃗w −⃗v .

Suppose that you live in a city with equally spaced streets running east-west and north-south and
that you want to tell someone how to get from one place to another. You’d be likely to tell them how
many blocks east-west and how many blocks north-south to go. For example, to get from P to Q in
Figure 13.7, we go 4 blocks east and 1 block south. If⃗i and⃗j are as shown in Figure 13.7, then the
displacement vector from P to Q is 4⃗i −⃗j .

We extend the same idea to 3 dimensions. First we choose a Cartesian system of coordinate
axes. The three vectors of length 1 shown in Figure 13.8 are the vector ⃗i , which points along the
positive x-axis, the vector ⃗j , along the positive y-axis, and the vector ⃗k , along the positive z-axis.

Any displacement in 3-space or the plane can be expressed as a combination of displacements in
the coordinate directions. For example, Figure 13.9 shows that the displacement vector ⃗v from the
origin to the point (3, 2) can be written as a sum of displacement vectors along the x- and y-axes:
⃗v = 3⃗i + 2⃗j .
This is called resolving ⃗v into components. In general:
We resolve ⃗v into components by writing ⃗v in the form
⃗v = v1⃗i + v2⃗j + v3⃗k ,
where v1, v2, v3 are scalars. We call v1⃗i , v2⃗j , and v3⃗k the components of ⃗v .
An Alternative Notation for Vectors
Many people write a vector in three dimensions as a string of three numbers, that is, as
⃗v = (v1, v2, v3)
instead of
⃗v = v1⃗i + v2⃗j + v3⃗k .
Since the ﬁrst notation can be confused with a point and the second cannot, we usually use the
second form.
Example 2
Resolve the displacement vector, ⃗v , from the point P1 = (2, 4, 10) to the point P2 = (3, 7, 6) into
components.
Solution
To get from P1 to P2, we move 1 unit in the positive x-direction, 3 units in the positive y-direction,
and 4 units in the negative z-direction. Hence ⃗v =⃗i + 3⃗j −4⃗k .
Example 3
Decide whether the vector ⃗v = 2⃗i + 3⃗j + 5⃗k is parallel to each of the following vectors:
⃗w = 4⃗i + 6⃗j + 10⃗k ,
⃗a = −⃗i −1.5⃗j −2.5⃗k ,
⃗b = 4⃗i + 6⃗j + 9⃗k .
Solution
Since ⃗w = 2⃗v and ⃗a = −0.5⃗v , the vectors ⃗v , ⃗w , and ⃗a are parallel. However,⃗b is not a multiple
of ⃗v (since, for example, 4/2 ̸= 9/5), so ⃗v and⃗b are not parallel.

In general, Figure 13.10 shows us how to express the displacement vector between two points
in components:
Components of Displacement Vectors
The displacement vector from the point P1 = (x1, y1, z1) to the point P2 = (x2, y2, z2) is
given in components by
−−−→
P1P2 = (x2 −x1)⃗i + (y2 −y1)⃗j + (z2 −z1)⃗k .
Position Vectors: Displacement of a Point from the Origin
A displacement vector whose tail is at the origin is called a position vector. Thus, any point (x0, y0, z0)
in space has associated with it the position vector ⃗r 0 = x0⃗i + y0⃗j + z0⃗k . (See Figure 13.11.) In
general, a position vector gives the displacement of a point from the origin.

The Components of the Zero Vector
The zero displacement vector has magnitude equal to zero and is written ⃗0 . So ⃗0 = 0⃗i + 0⃗j + 0⃗k .
The Magnitude of a Vector in Components
For a vector, ⃗v = v1⃗i + v2⃗j , the Pythagorean theorem is used to ﬁnd its magnitude, ∥⃗v ∥. (See
Figure 13.12.) The angle θ gives the direction of ⃗v .

Addition and Scalar Multiplication of Vectors in Components
Suppose the vectors ⃗v and ⃗w are given in components:
⃗v = v1⃗i + v2⃗j + v3⃗k
and
⃗w = w1⃗i + w2⃗j + w3⃗k .
Then
⃗v + ⃗w = (v1 + w1)⃗i + (v2 + w2)⃗j + (v3 + w3)⃗k ,
and
λ⃗v = λv1⃗i + λv2⃗j + λv3⃗k .
Figures 13.13 and 13.14 illustrate these properties in two dimensions. Finally, ⃗v −⃗w = ⃗v +
(−1)⃗w , so we can write ⃗v −⃗w = (v1 −w1)⃗i + (v2 −w2)⃗j + (v3 −w3)⃗k .

How to Resolve a Vector into Components
You may wonder how we ﬁnd the components of a 2-dimensional vector, given its length and di-
rection. Suppose the vector ⃗v has length v and makes an angle of θ with the x-axis, measured
counterclockwise, as in Figure 13.15. If ⃗v = v1⃗i + v2⃗j , Figure 13.15 shows that
v1 = v cos θ
and
v2 = v sin θ.
Thus, we resolve ⃗v into components by writing
⃗v = (v cosθ)⃗i + (v sin θ)⃗j .
Vectors in 3-space are resolved using direction cosines; see Problem 58 on page 754.

Unit Vectors
A unit vector is a vector whose magnitude is 1. The vectors ⃗i , ⃗j , and ⃗k are unit vectors in the
directions of the coordinate axes. It is often helpful to ﬁnd a unit vector in the same direction as a
given vector ⃗v . Suppose that ∥⃗v ∥= 10; a unit vector in the same direction as ⃗v is ⃗v /10. In general,
a unit vector in the direction of any nonzero vector ⃗v is
⃗u =
⃗v
∥⃗v ∥.
Example 5
Find a unit vector, ⃗u , in the direction of the vector ⃗v =⃗i + 3⃗j .
Solution
If ⃗v =⃗i + 3⃗j , then ∥⃗v ∥=

Example 6
Find a unit vector at the point (x, y, z) that points radially outward away from the origin.
Solution
The vector from the origin to (x, y, z) is the position vector
⃗r = x⃗i + y⃗j + z⃗k .
Thus, if we put its tail at (x, y, z) it will point away from the origin. Its magnitude is

13.2
VECTORS IN GENERAL
Besides displacement, there are many quantities that have both magnitude and direction and are
added and multiplied by scalars in the same way as displacements. Any such quantity is called a
vector and is represented by an arrow in the same manner we represent displacements. The length
of the arrow is the magnitude of the vector, and the direction of the arrow is the direction of the
vector.
Velocity Versus Speed
The speed of a moving body tells us how fast it is moving, say 80 km/hr. The speed is just a number;
it is therefore a scalar. The velocity, on the other hand, tells us both how fast the body is moving and
the direction of motion; it is a vector. For instance, if a car is heading northeast at 80 km/hr, then its
velocity is a vector of length 80 pointing northeast.

13.2 VECTORS IN GENERAL
727
The velocity vector of a moving object is a vector whose magnitude is the speed of the object
and whose direction is the direction of its motion.
The velocity vector is the displacement vector if the object moves at constant velocity for one
unit of time.
Example 1
A car is traveling north at a speed of 100 km/hr, while a plane above is ﬂying horizontally southwest
at a speed of 500 km/hr. Draw the velocity vectors of the car and the plane.
Solution
Figure 13.19 shows the velocity vectors. The plane’s velocity vector is ﬁve times as long as the car’s,
because its speed is ﬁve times as great.

Figure 13.19: Velocity vector of the car is 100 km/hr north and of the plane is 500 km/hr southwest
The next example illustrates that the velocity vectors for two motions add to give the velocity
vector for the combined motion, just as displacements do.
Example 2
A riverboat is moving with velocity ⃗v and a speed of 8 km/hr relative to the water. In addition, the
river has a current ⃗c and a speed of 1 km/hr. (See Figure 13.20.) What is the physical signiﬁcance
of the vector ⃗v + ⃗c ?
⃗v + ⃗c
⃗v = Velocity relative to water
∥⃗v ∥= 8 km/hr
⃗c = Velocity of current
∥⃗c ∥= 1 km/hr
Figure 13.20: Boat’s velocity relative to the river bed is the sum, ⃗v + ⃗c
Solution
The vector ⃗v shows how the boat is moving relative to the water, while ⃗c shows how the water is
moving relative to the riverbed. During an hour, imagine that the boat ﬁrst moves 8 km relative to the
water, which remains still; this displacement is represented by ⃗v . Then imagine the water moving
1 km while the boat remains stationary relative to the water; this displacement is represented by ⃗c .
The combined displacement is represented by ⃗v + ⃗c . Thus, the vector ⃗v + ⃗c is the velocity of the
boat relative to the riverbed.
Note that the effective speed of the boat is not necessarily 9 km/hr unless the boat is moving in
the direction of the current. Although we add the velocity vectors, we do not necessarily add their
lengths.
Scalar multiplication also makes sense for velocity vectors. For example, if ⃗v is a velocity
vector, then −2⃗v represents a velocity of twice the magnitude in the opposite direction.
Example 3
A ball is moving with velocity ⃗v when it hits a wall at a right angle and bounces straight back, with
its speed reduced by 20%. Express its new velocity in terms of the old one.
Solution
The new velocity is −0.8⃗v , where the negative sign expresses the fact that the new velocity is in the
direction opposite to the old.

728
Chapter Thirteen A FUNDAMENTAL TOOL: VECTORS
We can represent velocity vectors in components in the same way we did on page 723.
Example 4
Represent the velocity vectors of the car and the plane in Example 1 using components. Take north
to be the positive y-axis, east to be the positive x-axis, and upward to be the positive z-axis.
Solution
The car is traveling north at 100 km/hr, so the y-component of its velocity is 100⃗j and the x-
component is 0⃗i . Since it is traveling horizontally, the z-component is 0⃗k . So we have
Velocity of car = 0⃗i + 100⃗j + 0⃗k = 100⃗j .
The plane’s velocity vector also has ⃗k component equal to zero. Since it is traveling southwest,
its⃗i and ⃗j components have negative coefﬁcients (north and east are positive). Since the plane is
traveling at 500 km/hr, in one hour it is displaced 500/
√
2 ≈354 km to the west and 354 km to the
south. (See Figure 13.21.) Thus,
Velocity of plane = −(500 cos45◦)⃗i −(500 sin 45◦)⃗j ≈−354⃗i −354⃗j .
Of course, if the car were climbing a hill or if the plane were descending for a landing, then the ⃗k
component would not be zero.

Acceleration
Another example of a vector quantity is acceleration. Acceleration, like velocity, is speciﬁed by both
a magnitude and a direction — for example, the acceleration due to gravity is 9.81 m/sec2 vertically
downward.
Force
Force is another example of a vector quantity. Suppose you push on an open door. The result depends
both on how hard you push and in what direction. Thus, to specify a force we must give its magnitude
(or strength) and the direction in which it is acting. For example, the gravitational force exerted on an
object by the earth is a vector pointing from the object toward the center of the earth; its magnitude
is the strength of the gravitational force.
Example 5
The earth travels around the sun in an ellipse. The gravitational force on the earth and the velocity
of the earth are governed by the following laws:
Newton’s Law of Gravitation: The gravitational attraction, ⃗F , of a mass m1 on a mass m2 at a

toward m1.
Kepler’s Second Law: The line joining a planet to the sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times.
(a) Sketch vectors representing the gravitational force of the sun on the earth at two different posi-
tions in the earth’s orbit.
(b) Sketch the velocity vector of the earth at two points in its orbit.
Solution
(a) Figure 13.22 shows the earth orbiting the sun. Note that the gravitational force vector always
points toward the sun and is larger when the earth is closer to the sun because of the r2 term in
the denominator. (In fact, the real orbit looks much more like a circle than we have shown here.)
(b) The velocity vector points in the direction of motion of the earth. Thus, the velocity vector is
tangent to the ellipse. See Figure 13.23. Furthermore, the velocity vector is longer at points of
the orbit where the planet is moving quickly, because the magnitude of the velocity vector is
the speed. Kepler’s Second Law enables us to determine when the earth is moving quickly and
when it is moving slowly. Over a ﬁxed period of time, say one month, the line joining the earth
to the sun sweeps out a sector having a certain area. Figure 13.23 shows two sectors swept out
in two different one-month time-intervals. Kepler’s law says that the areas of the two sectors are
the same. Thus, the earth must move farther in a month when it is close to the sun than when
it is far from the sun. Therefore, the earth moves faster when it is closer to the sun and slower
when it is farther away.

Properties of Addition and Scalar Multiplication
In general, vectors add, subtract, and are multiplied by scalars in the same way as displacement vec-
tors. Thus, for any vectors ⃗u ,⃗v , and ⃗w and any scalars α and β, we have the following properties:
Commutativity
1. ⃗v + ⃗w = ⃗w + ⃗v
Distributivity
4. (α + β)⃗v = α⃗v + β⃗v
5. α(⃗v + ⃗w ) = α⃗v + α⃗w
Associativity
2. (⃗u + ⃗v ) + ⃗w = ⃗u + (⃗v + ⃗w )
3. α(β⃗v ) = (αβ)⃗v

6. 1⃗v = ⃗v
7. 0⃗v = ⃗0
8. ⃗v +⃗0 = ⃗v

displacement vectors.

Using Components
Example 6
A plane, heading due east at an airspeed of 600 km/hr, experiences a wind of 50 km/hr blowing
toward the northeast. Find the plane’s direction and ground speed.
Solution
We choose a coordinate system with the x-axis pointing east and the y-axis pointing north. See
Figure 13.24.
The airspeed tells us the speed of the plane relative to still air. Thus, the plane is moving due
east with velocity ⃗v = 600⃗i relative to still air. In addition, the air is moving with a velocity ⃗w .
Writing ⃗w in components, we have
⃗w = (50cos45◦)⃗i + (50sin45◦)⃗j = 35.4⃗i + 35.4⃗j .
The vector ⃗v + ⃗w represents the displacement of the plane in one hour relative to the ground.
Therefore, ⃗v + ⃗w is the velocity of the plane relative to the ground. In components, we have
⃗v + ⃗w = 600⃗i +

35.4⃗i + 35.4⃗j

= 635.4⃗i + 35.4⃗j .
The direction of the plane’s motion relative to the ground is given by the angle θ in Figure 13.24,
where
tan θ = 35.4
635.4
so
θ = arctan
 35.4

= 3.2◦.
The ground speed is the speed of the plane relative to the ground, so
Groundspeed =

635.42 + 35.42 = 636.4 km/hr.
Thus, the speed of the plane relative to the ground has been increased slightly by the wind.
(This is as we would expect, as the wind has a positive component in the direction in which the
plane is traveling.) The angle θ shows how far the plane is blown off course by the wind.

Vectors in n Dimensions
Using the alternative notation ⃗v = (v1, v2, v3) for a vector in 3-space, we can deﬁne a vector in n
dimensions as a string of n numbers. Thus, a vector in n dimensions can be written as
⃗c = (c1, c2, . . . , cn).
Addition and scalar multiplication are deﬁned by the formulas
⃗v + ⃗w = (v1, v2, . . . , vn) + (w1, w2, . . . , wn) = (v1 + w1, v2 + w2, . . . , vn + wn)
and
λ⃗v = λ(v1, v2, . . . , vn) = (λv1, λv2, . . . , λvn).

13.2 VECTORS IN GENERAL

Why Do We Want Vectors in n Dimensions?
Vectors in two and three dimensions can be used to model displacement, velocities, or forces. But
what about vectors in n dimensions? There is another interpretation of 3-dimensional vectors (or
3-vectors) that is useful: they can be thought of as listing three different quantities — for example,
the displacements parallel to the x-, y-, and z-axes. Similarly, the n-vector
⃗c = (c1, c2, . . . , cn)
can be thought of as a way of keeping n different quantities organized. For example, a population
vector ⃗N shows the number of children and adults in a population:
⃗N = (Number of children, Number of adults),
or, if we are interested in a more detailed breakdown of ages, we might give the number in each
ten-year age bracket in the population (up to age 110) in the form
⃗N = (N1, N2, N3, N4, . . . , N10, N11),
where N1 is the population aged 0–9, and N2 is the population aged 10–19, and so on.
A consumption vector,
⃗q = (q1, q2, . . . , qn)
shows the quantities q1, q2, . . ., qn consumed of each of n different goods. A price vector
⃗p = (p1, p2, . . . , pn)
contains the prices of n different items.
In 1907, Hermann Minkowski used vectors with four components when he introduced space-
time coordinates, whereby each event is assigned a vector position ⃗v with four coordinates, three
for its position in space and one for time:
⃗v = (x, y, z, t).
Example 7
Suppose the vector ⃗I represents the number of copies, in thousands, made by each of four copy
centers in the month of December and ⃗J represents the number of copies made at the same four
copy centers during the previous eleven months (the “year-to-date”). If ⃗I = (25, 211, 818, 642),
and ⃗J = (331, 3227, 1377, 2570), compute ⃗I + ⃗J . What does this sum represent?
Solution
The sum is
⃗I + ⃗J = (25 + 331, 211 + 3227, 818 + 1377, 642 + 2570) = (356, 3438, 2195, 3212).
Each term in ⃗I + ⃗J represents the sum of the number of copies made in December plus those in
the previous eleven months, that is, the total number of copies made during the entire year at that
particular copy center.
Example 8
The price vector ⃗p = (p1, p2, p3) represents the prices in dollars of three goods. Write a vector that
gives the prices of the same goods in cents.
Solution
The prices in cents are 100p1, 100p2, and 100p3 respectively, so the new price vector is
(100p1, 100p2, 100p3) = 100⃗p .

THE DOT PRODUCT
We have seen how to add vectors; can we multiply two vectors together? In the next two sections
we will see two different ways of doing so: the scalar product (or dot product), which produces a
scalar, and the vector product (or cross product), which produces a vector.
Definition of the Dot Product
The dot product links geometry and algebra. We already know how to calculate the length of a vector
from its components; the dot product gives us a way of computing the angle between two vectors.
For any two vectors ⃗v = v1⃗i + v2⃗j + v3⃗k and ⃗w = w1⃗i + w2⃗j + w3⃗k , shown in Figure 13.26,
we deﬁne a scalar as follows:
The following two deﬁnitions of the dot product, or scalar product, ⃗v · ⃗w , are equivalent:
• Geometric deﬁnition
⃗v · ⃗w = ∥⃗v ∥∥⃗w ∥cosθ
where θ is the angle between ⃗v and ⃗w and 0 ≤θ ≤π.
• Algebraic deﬁnition
⃗v · ⃗w = v1w1 + v2w2 + v3w3.
Notice that the dot product of two vectors is a number, not a vector.
Why don’t we give just one deﬁnition of ⃗v · ⃗w ? The reason is that both deﬁnitions are equally
important; the geometric deﬁnition gives us a picture of what the dot product means and the alge-
braic deﬁnition gives us a way of calculating it.
How do we know the two deﬁnitions are equivalent—that is, they really do deﬁne the same
thing? First, we observe that the two deﬁnitions give the same result in a particular example. Then
we show why they are equivalent in general.

Example 1
Suppose ⃗v =⃗i and ⃗w = 2⃗i + 2⃗j . Compute ⃗v · ⃗w both geometrically and algebraically.
Solution
To use the geometric deﬁnition, see Figure 13.27. The angle between the vectors is π/4, or 45◦, and
the lengths of the vectors are given by
∥⃗v ∥= 1
and
∥⃗w ∥= 2

2.
Thus,
⃗v · ⃗w = ∥⃗v ∥∥⃗w ∥cosθ = 1 · 2

= 2.
Using the algebraic deﬁnition, we get the same result:
⃗v · ⃗w = 1 · 2 + 0 · 2 = 2.

13.3 THE DOT PRODUCT
735
Why the Two Definitions of the Dot Product Give the Same Result
In the previous example, the two deﬁnitions give the same value for the dot product. To show that
the geometric and algebraic deﬁnitions of the dot product always give the same result, we must
show that, for any vectors ⃗v = v1⃗i + v2⃗j + v3⃗k and ⃗w = w1⃗i + w2⃗j + w3⃗k with an angle θ
between them:
∥⃗v ∥∥⃗w ∥cosθ = v1w1 + v2w2 + v3w3.
One method follows; a method that does not use trigonometry is given in Problem 69 on page 743.
Using the Law of Cosines. Suppose that 0 < θ < π, so that the vectors ⃗v and ⃗w form a
triangle. (See Figure 13.28.) By the Law of Cosines, we have
∥⃗v −⃗w ∥2 = ∥⃗v ∥2 + ∥⃗w ∥2 −2∥⃗v ∥∥⃗w ∥cosθ.
This result is also true for θ = 0 and θ = π. We calculate the lengths using components:
∥⃗v ∥2 = v2
1 + v2
2 + v2
3
∥⃗w ∥2 = w2
1 + w2
2 + w2
3
∥⃗v −⃗w ∥2 = (v1 −w1)2 + (v2 −w2)2 + (v3 −w3)2
= v2
1 −2v1w1 + w2
1 + v2
2 −2v2w2 + w2
2 + v2
3 −2v3w3 + w2
3.
Substituting into the Law of Cosines and canceling, we see that
−2v1w1 −2v2w2 −2v3w3 = −2∥⃗v ∥∥⃗w ∥cos θ.
Therefore we have the result we wanted, namely that:
v1w1 + v2w2 + v3w3 = ∥⃗v ∥∥⃗w ∥cosθ.

Properties of the Dot Product
The following properties of the dot product can be justiﬁed using the algebraic deﬁnition; see Prob-
lem 63 on page 742. For a geometric interpretation of Property 3, see Problem 66.
Properties of the Dot Product. For any vectors ⃗u , ⃗v , and ⃗w and any scalar λ,
1. ⃗v · ⃗w = ⃗w · ⃗v
2. ⃗v · (λ⃗w ) = λ(⃗v · ⃗w ) = (λ⃗v ) · ⃗w
3. (⃗v + ⃗w ) · ⃗u = ⃗v · ⃗u + ⃗w · ⃗u
Perpendicularity, Magnitude, and Dot Products
Two vectors are perpendicular if the angle between them is π/2 or 90◦. Since cos(π/2) = 0, if ⃗v
and ⃗w are perpendicular, then ⃗v · ⃗w = 0. Conversely, provided that ⃗v · ⃗w = 0, then cos θ = 0, so
θ = π/2 and the vectors are perpendicular. Thus, we have the following result:

736
Chapter Thirteen A FUNDAMENTAL TOOL: VECTORS
Two non-zero vectors ⃗v and ⃗w are perpendicular, or orthogonal, if and only if
⃗v · ⃗w = 0.
For example:⃗i ·⃗j = 0, ⃗j · ⃗k = 0,⃗i · ⃗k = 0.
If we take the dot product of a vector with itself, then θ = 0 and cos θ = 1. For any vector ⃗v :
Magnitude and dot product are related as follows:
⃗v · ⃗v = ∥⃗v ∥2.
For example:⃗i ·⃗i = 1, ⃗j ·⃗j = 1, ⃗k · ⃗k = 1.
Using the Dot Product
Depending on the situation, one deﬁnition of the dot product may be more convenient to use than
the other. In Example 2, the geometric deﬁnition is the only one that can be used because we are not
given components. In Example 3, the algebraic deﬁnition is used.
Example 2
Suppose the vector⃗b is ﬁxed and has length 2; the vector ⃗a is free to rotate and has length 3. What
are the maximum and minimum values of the dot product ⃗a ·⃗b as the vector ⃗a rotates through all
possible positions? What positions of ⃗a and⃗b lead to these values?
Solution
The geometric deﬁnition gives ⃗a ·⃗b = ∥⃗a ∥∥⃗b ∥cosθ = 3 · 2 cosθ = 6 cosθ. Thus, the maximum
value of ⃗a ·⃗b is 6, and it occurs when cos θ = 1 so θ = 0, that is, when ⃗a and⃗b point in the same
direction. The minimum value of ⃗a · ⃗b is −6, and it occurs when cos θ = −1 so θ = π, that is,
when ⃗a and⃗b point in opposite directions. (See Figure 13.29.)

is zero. Since the vectors are given in components, we calculate dot products using the algebraic
deﬁnition:
⃗v · ⃗u = (⃗i +

3⃗j + 0⃗k ) · (⃗i + 0⃗j +

3⃗k ) = 1 · 1 +

Normal Vectors and the Equation of a Plane
In Section 12.4 we wrote the equation of a plane given its x-slope, y-slope and z-intercept. Now
we write the equation of a plane using a vector ⃗n and a point P0. The key idea is that all the
displacement vectors from P0 that are perpendicular to ⃗n form a plane. To picture this, imagine a
pencil balanced on a table, with other pencils fanned out on the table in different directions. The
upright pencil is ⃗n , its base is P0, the other pencils are perpendicular displacement vectors, and the
table is the plane.
More formally, a normal vector to a plane is a vector that is perpendicular to the plane, that
is, it is perpendicular to every displacement vector between any two points in the plane. Let ⃗n =
a⃗i +b⃗j +c⃗k be a normal vector to the plane, let P0 = (x0, y0, z0) be a ﬁxed point in the plane, and
let P = (x, y, z) be any other point in the plane. Then −−→
P0P = (x−x0)⃗i +(y −y0)⃗j +(z −z0)⃗k is
a vector whose head and tail both lie in the plane. (See Figure 13.30.) Thus, the vectors ⃗n and −−→
P0P
are perpendicular, so ⃗n · −−→
P0P = 0. The algebraic deﬁnition of the dot product gives ⃗n · −−→
P0P =
a(x −x0) + b(y −y0) + c(z −z0), so we obtain the following result:

Figure 13.30: Plane with normal ⃗n and containing a ﬁxed point (x0, y0, z0)
The equation of the plane with normal vector ⃗n = a⃗i + b⃗j + c⃗k and containing the point
P0 = (x0, y0, z0) is
a(x −x0) + b(y −y0) + c(z −z0) = 0.
Letting d = ax0 + by0 + cz0 (a constant), we can write the equation of the plane in the form
ax + by + cz = d.
Example 5
(a) Find the equation of the plane perpendicular to ⃗n = −⃗i + 3⃗j + 2⃗k and passing through the
point (1, 0, 4).
(b) Find a vector parallel to the plane.
Solution
(a) The equation of the plane is
−(x −1) + 3(y −0) + 2(z −4) = 0,
which can be written as
−x + 3y + 2z = 7.

738
Chapter Thirteen A FUNDAMENTAL TOOL: VECTORS
(b) Any vector ⃗v that is perpendicular to n is also parallel to the plane, so we look for any vector
satisfying ⃗v · ⃗n = 0; for example, ⃗v = 3⃗i +⃗j . There are many other possible vectors.
Example 6
Find a normal vector to the plane with equation (a)
x −y + 2z = 5
(b)
z = 0.5x + 1.2y.
Solution
(a) Since the coefﬁcients of⃗i , ⃗j , and ⃗k in a normal vector are the coefﬁcients of x, y, and z in the
equation of the plane, a normal vector is ⃗n =⃗i −⃗j + 2⃗k .
(b) Before we can ﬁnd a normal vector, we rewrite the equation of the plane in the form
0.5x + 1.2y −z = 0.
Thus, a normal vector is ⃗n = 0.5⃗i + 1.2⃗j −⃗k .
The Dot Product in n Dimensions
The algebraic deﬁnition of the dot product can be extended to vectors in higher dimensions.
If ⃗u = (u1, . . . , un) and ⃗v = (v1, . . . , vn) then the dot product of ⃗u and ⃗v is the scalar
⃗u · ⃗v = u1v1 + · · · + unvn.
Example 7
A video store sells videos, tapes, CDs, and computer games. We deﬁne the quantity vector ⃗q =
(q1, q2, q3, q4), where q1, q2, q3, q4 denote the quantities sold of each of the items, and the price
vector ⃗p = (p1, p2, p3, p4), where p1, p2, p3, p4 denote the price per unit of each item. What does
the dot product ⃗p · ⃗q represent?
Solution
The dot product is ⃗p · ⃗q = p1q1 + p2q2 + p3q3 + p4q4. The quantity p1q1 represents the revenue
received by the store for the videos, p2q2 represents the revenue for the tapes, and so on. The dot
product represents the total revenue received by the store for the sale of these four items.
Resolving a Vector into Components: Projections
In Section 13.1, we resolved a vector into components parallel to the axes. Now we see how to re-
solve a vector, ⃗v , into components, called ⃗v parallel and ⃗v perp, which are parallel and perpendicular,
respectively, to a given non-zero vector, ⃗u . (See Figure 13.31.)

Figure 13.31: Resolving ⃗v into components parallel and perpendicular to ⃗u
(a) 0 < θ < π/2
(b) π/2 < θ < π
The projection of ⃗v on ⃗u , written ⃗v parallel, measures (in some sense) how much the vector ⃗v
is aligned with the vector ⃗u . The length of ⃗v parallel is the length of the shadow cast by ⃗v on a line
in the direction of ⃗u .
To compute⃗v parallel, we assume ⃗u is a unit vector. (If not, create one by dividing by its length.)
Then Figure 13.31(a) shows that, if 0 ≤θ ≤π/2:
∥⃗v parallel∥= ∥⃗v ∥cos θ = ⃗v · ⃗u
(since ∥⃗u ∥= 1).
Now ⃗v parallel is a scalar multiple of ⃗u , and since ⃗u is a unit vector,
⃗v parallel = (∥⃗v ∥cosθ)⃗u = (⃗v · ⃗u )⃗u .

13.3 THE DOT PRODUCT
739
A similar argument shows that if π/2 < θ ≤π, as in Figure 13.31(b), this formula for ⃗v parallel still
holds. The vector ⃗v perp is speciﬁed by
⃗v perp = ⃗v −⃗v parallel.
Thus, we have the following results:
Projection of ⃗v on the Line in the Direction of the Unit Vector ⃗u
If ⃗v parallel and ⃗v perp are components of ⃗v that are parallel and perpendicular, respectively,
to ⃗u , then
Projection of ⃗v onto ⃗u = ⃗v parallel = (⃗v · ⃗u )⃗u
provided ∥⃗u ∥= 1
and
⃗v = ⃗v parallel + ⃗v perp
so
⃗v perp = ⃗v −⃗v parallel.

Solution
Let ⃗u be a unit vector in the direction of travel. The force of the wind on the sail makes an angle of
30◦with ⃗u . Thus, the component of this force in the direction of ⃗u is
⃗F parallel = (⃗F · ⃗u )⃗u = ∥⃗F ∥(cos 30◦)⃗u = 0.87∥⃗F ∥⃗u .
Thus, the boat is being pushed forward with about 87% of the total force due to the wind. (In fact,
the interaction of wind and sail is much more complex than this model suggests.)
A Physical Interpretation of the Dot Product: Work
In physics, the word “work” has a different meaning from its everyday meaning. In physics, when a
force of magnitude F acts on an object through a distance d, we say the work, W, done by the force
is
W = Fd,
provided the force and the displacement are in the same direction. For example, if a 1 kg body falls
10 meters under the force of gravity, which is 9.8 newtons, then the work done by gravity is
W = (9.8 newtons) · (10 meters) = 98 joules.
What if the force and the displacement are not in the same direction? Suppose a force ⃗F acts
on an object as it moves along a displacement vector ⃗d . Let θ be the angle between ⃗F and ⃗d . First,
we assume 0 ≤θ ≤π/2. Figure 13.33 shows how we can resolve ⃗F into components that are
parallel and perpendicular to ⃗d :
⃗F = ⃗F parallel + ⃗F perp.

740
Chapter Thirteen A FUNDAMENTAL TOOL: VECTORS
Then the work done by ⃗F is deﬁned to be
W = ∥⃗F parallel∥∥⃗d ∥.
We see from Figure 13.33 that ⃗F parallel has magnitude ∥⃗F ∥cosθ. So the work is given by the dot
product:
W = (∥⃗F ∥cosθ)∥⃗d ∥= ∥⃗F ∥∥⃗d ∥cosθ = ⃗F · ⃗d .

⃗F perp
⃗F parallel
Figure 13.33: Resolving the force ⃗F into two forces, one parallel to ⃗d , one perpendicular to ⃗d
The formula W = ⃗F · ⃗d holds when π/2 < θ ≤π also. In that case, the work done by the
force is negative and the object is moving against the force. Thus, we have the following deﬁnition:
The work, W, done by a force ⃗F acting on an object through a displacement ⃗d is given by
W = ⃗F · ⃗d .
Example 9
How much work does the wind do on the sailboat from Example 8 if the boat moves 20 m and the
wind’s force is 120 newtons?
Solution
From Example 8, we know that the force of the wind ⃗F makes a 30◦angle with the boat’s displace-
ment ⃗d . Since ∥⃗F ∥= 120 and ∥⃗d ∥= 20, the work done by the wind on the boat is
W = ⃗F · ⃗d = ∥⃗F ∥∥⃗d ∥cos 30◦= 2078.461 joules.
Notice that if the vectors ⃗F and ⃗d are parallel and in the same direction, with magnitudes F
and d, then cos θ = cos 0 = 1, so W = ∥⃗F ∥∥⃗d ∥= Fd, which is the original deﬁnition. When
the vectors are perpendicular, cos θ = cos(π/2) = 0, so W = 0 and no work is done in the
technical deﬁnition of the word. For example, if you carry a heavy box across the room at the same
horizontal height, no work is done by gravity because the force of gravity is vertical but the motion
is horizontal.

THE CROSS PRODUCT
In the previous section we combined two vectors to get a number, the dot product. In this section
we see another way of combining two vectors, this time to get a vector, the cross product. Any two
vectors in 3-space form a parallelogram. We deﬁne the cross product using this parallelogram.
The Area of a Parallelogram
Consider the parallelogram formed by the vectors ⃗v and ⃗w with an angle of θ between them. Then
Figure 13.35 shows
Area of parallelogram = Base · Height = ∥⃗v ∥∥⃗w ∥sin θ.
How would we compute the area of the parallelogram if we were given ⃗v and ⃗w in components,
⃗v = v1⃗i + v2⃗j + v3⃗k and ⃗w = w1⃗i + w2⃗j + w3⃗k ? Project 1 on page 755 shows that if ⃗v and ⃗w
are in the xy-plane so that v3 = w3 = 0, then
Area of parallelogram = |v1w2 −v2w1| .
What if ⃗v and ⃗w do not lie in the xy-plane? The cross product will enable us to compute the area
of the parallelogram formed by any two vectors.

Definition of the Cross Product
We deﬁne the cross product of the vectors ⃗v and ⃗w , written ⃗v × ⃗w , to be a vector perpendicular
to both ⃗v and ⃗w . The magnitude of this vector is the area of the parallelogram formed by the two
vectors. The direction of ⃗v × ⃗w is given by the normal vector, ⃗n , to the plane deﬁned by ⃗v and
⃗w . If we require that ⃗n be a unit vector, there are two choices for ⃗n , pointing out of the plane in
opposite directions. We pick one by the following rule (see Figure 13.36):
The right-hand rule: Place ⃗v and ⃗w so that their tails coincide and curl the ﬁngers of your
right hand through the smaller of the two angles from ⃗v to ⃗w ; your thumb points in the
direction of the normal vector, ⃗n .
Like the dot product, there are two equivalent deﬁnitions of the cross product:

13.4 THE CROSS PRODUCT
745
The following two deﬁnitions of the cross product or vector product ⃗v × ⃗w are equivalent:
• Geometric deﬁnition
If ⃗v and ⃗w are not parallel, then
⃗v × ⃗w =

Area of parallelogram
with edges ⃗v and ⃗w

⃗n = (∥⃗v ∥∥⃗w ∥sin θ)⃗n ,
where 0 ≤θ ≤π is the angle between ⃗v and ⃗w and ⃗n is the unit vector perpendicular to
⃗v and ⃗w pointing in the direction given by the right-hand rule. If ⃗v and ⃗w are parallel,
then ⃗v × ⃗w = ⃗0 .
• Algebraic deﬁnition
⃗v × ⃗w = (v2w3 −v3w2)⃗i + (v3w1 −v1w3)⃗j + (v1w2 −v2w1)⃗k
where ⃗v = v1⃗i + v2⃗j + v3⃗k and ⃗w = w1⃗i + w2⃗j + w3⃗k .
Problems 45 and 48 at the end of this section show that the geometric and algebraic deﬁnitions
of the cross product give the same result.

The geometric deﬁnition shows us that the cross product is rotation invariant. Imagine the two
vectors ⃗v and ⃗w as two metal rods welded together. Attach a third rod whose direction and length
correspond to ⃗v × ⃗w . (See Figure 13.37.) Then, no matter how we turn this set of rods, the third
will still be the cross product of the ﬁrst two.
The algebraic deﬁnition is more easily remembered by writing it as a 3 × 3 determinant. (See
Appendix E.)

Example 1
Find⃗i ×⃗j and ⃗j ×⃗i .
Solution
The vectors⃗i and ⃗j both have magnitude 1 and the angle between them is π/2. By the right-hand
rule, the vector⃗i ×⃗j is in the direction of ⃗k , so ⃗n = ⃗k and we have
⃗i ×⃗j =

⃗k = ⃗k .
Similarly, the right-hand rule says that the direction of ⃗j ×⃗i is −⃗k , so

Similar calculations show that ⃗j × ⃗k =⃗i and ⃗k ×⃗i = ⃗j .
Example 2
For any vector ⃗v , ﬁnd ⃗v × ⃗v .
Solution
Since ⃗v is parallel to itself, ⃗v × ⃗v = ⃗0 .
Example 3

=⃗i −8⃗j −3⃗k .
To check that ⃗v × ⃗w is perpendicular to ⃗v , we compute the dot product:
⃗v · (⃗v × ⃗w ) = (2⃗i +⃗j −2⃗k ) · (⃗i −8⃗j −3⃗k ) = 2 −8 + 6 = 0.
Similarly,
⃗w · (⃗v × ⃗w ) = (3⃗i + 0⃗j + ⃗k ) · (⃗i −8⃗j −3⃗k ) = 3 + 0 −3 = 0.
Thus, ⃗v × ⃗w is perpendicular to both ⃗v and ⃗w .
Properties of the Cross Product
The right-hand rule tells us that ⃗v × ⃗w and ⃗w × ⃗v point in opposite directions. The magnitudes of
⃗v × ⃗w and ⃗w × ⃗v are the same, so ⃗w × ⃗v = −(⃗v × ⃗w ). (See Figure 13.38.)

48 at the end of this section.
Properties of the Cross Product
For vectors ⃗u ,⃗v , ⃗w and scalar λ
1. ⃗w × ⃗v = −(⃗v × ⃗w )
2. (λ⃗v ) × ⃗w = λ(⃗v × ⃗w ) = ⃗v × (λ⃗w )
3. ⃗u × (⃗v + ⃗w ) = ⃗u × ⃗v + ⃗u × ⃗w .

13.4 THE CROSS PRODUCT
747
The Equation of a Plane Through Three Points
As we saw on page 737, the equation of a plane is determined by a point P0 = (x0, y0, z0) on the
plane, and a normal vector, ⃗n = a⃗i + b⃗j + c⃗k:
a(x −x0) + b(y −y0) + c(z −z0) = 0.
However, a plane can also be determined by three points on it (provided they do not lie on the same
line). In that case we can ﬁnd an equation of the plane by ﬁrst determining two vectors in the plane
and then ﬁnding a normal vector using the cross product, as in the following example.
Example 4
Find an equation of the plane containing the points P = (1, 3, 0), Q = (3, 4, −3), and R = (3, 6, 2).
Solution
Since the points P and Q are in the plane, the displacement vector between them, −−→
PQ, is in the
plane, where
−−→
PQ = (3 −1)⃗i + (4 −3)⃗j + (−3 −0)⃗k = 2⃗i +⃗j −3⃗k .
The displacement vector −→
PR is also in the plane, where
−→
PR = (3 −1)⃗i + (6 −3)⃗j + (2 −0)⃗k = 2⃗i + 3⃗j + 2⃗k .
Thus, a normal vector, ⃗n , to the plane is given by
⃗n = −−→
PQ × −→
PR =

⃗i ⃗j ⃗k
2 1 −3
2 3 2

= 11⃗i −10⃗j + 4⃗k .
Since the point (1, 3, 0) is on the plane, the equation of the plane is
11(x −1) −10(y −3) + 4(z −0) = 0,
which simpliﬁes to
11x −10y + 4z = −19.
You should check that P, Q, and R satisfy this equation, since they lie on the plane.
Areas and Volumes Using the Cross Product and Determinants
We can use the cross product to calculate the area of the parallelogram with sides ⃗v and ⃗w . We say
that ⃗v × ⃗w is the area vector of the parallelogram. The geometric deﬁnition of the cross product
tells us that ⃗v × ⃗w is normal to the parallelogram and gives us the following result:
Area of a parallelogram with edges ⃗v = v1⃗i + v2⃗j + v3⃗k and ⃗w = w1⃗i + w2⃗j + w3⃗k is
given by
Area = ∥⃗v × ⃗w ∥,
where
⃗v × ⃗w =

Volume of a Parallelepiped
Consider the parallelepiped with sides formed by ⃗a ,⃗b , and ⃗c . (See Figure 13.39.) Since the base is
formed by the vectors⃗b and ⃗c , we have
Area of base of parallelepiped = ∥⃗b × ⃗c ∥.

The vectors ⃗a , ⃗b , and ⃗c can be arranged either as in Figure 13.40 or as in Figure 13.41. In
either case,
Height of parallelepiped = ∥⃗a ∥cos θ,
where θ is the angle shown in the ﬁgures. In Figure 13.40 the angle θ is less than π/2, so the product,
(⃗b × ⃗c ) · ⃗a , called the triple product, is positive. Thus, in this case
Volume of parallelepiped = Base · Height = ∥⃗b × ⃗c ∥· ∥⃗a ∥cos θ = (⃗b × ⃗c ) · ⃗a .
In Figure 13.41, the angle, π −θ, between ⃗a and⃗b ×⃗c is more than π/2, so the product (⃗b ×⃗c )·⃗a
is negative. Thus, in this case we have
Volume = Base · Height = ∥⃗b × ⃗c ∥· ∥⃗a ∥cos θ = −∥⃗b × ⃗c ∥· ∥⃗a ∥cos(π −θ)
= −(⃗b × ⃗c ) · ⃗a =
(⃗b × ⃗c ) · ⃗a

Therefore, in both cases the volume is given by
(⃗b × ⃗c ) · ⃗a

Volume of a parallelepiped with edges ⃗a ,⃗b , ⃗c is given by

46. In this problem, we arrive at the algebraic deﬁnition for

tor ⃗v = x⃗i + y⃗j + z⃗k that is perpendicular to both ⃗a

for x, y, and z. Eliminate x and solve for y in terms of
z. Then eliminate y and solve for x in terms of z. Since
z can be any value whatsoever (the direction of ⃗v is un-

Next, show that for any vector ⃗d ,
[((⃗a +⃗b ) × ⃗c ) −(⃗a × ⃗c ) −(⃗b × ⃗c )] · ⃗d = 0.

3. A Warren Truss
A Warren truss is a structure for bearing a weight such as a roof or a bridge with two supports
at either end of a gap. The truss in Figure 13.51 is loaded by weights at points D and E and is
supported by vertical forces at points A and C. The horizontal bars in the truss are 10 ft long
and the diagonal bars are 12 ft. Angles A and C are 65.38◦.
Each bar exerts a force at the two joints at its ends. The two force vectors are parallel to
the bar, equal in magnitude, and opposite in direction. If the bar pushes on the joints at its ends,
then the bar is under compression, and if it pulls it is under tension, and the magnitude of the
force is called the magnitude of the tension or compression.
Engineers need to know the magnitude of the compression or tension in each of the bars
of the truss to prevent them from bending or breaking. To determine these magnitudes, we use
the fact that at each joint the sum of the external forces from the weights and supports and the
pushing and pulling forces exerted by the bars is zero. Find the magnitudes for all seven bars in
this order:
(a) Joint A; Bars AB, AE
(b) Joint C; Bars BC, CD

14.1
THE PARTIAL DERIVATIVE
The derivative of a one-variable function measures its rate of change. In this section we see how a
two-variable function has two rates of change: one as x changes (with y held constant) and one as y
changes (with x held constant).
Rate of Change of Temperature in a Metal Rod: a One-Variable Problem
Imagine an unevenly heated metal rod lying along the x-axis, with its left end at the origin and x
measured in meters. (See Figure 14.1.) Let u(x) be the temperature (in ◦C) of the rod at the point
x. Table 14.1 gives values of u(x). We see that the temperature increases as we move along the rod,
reaching its maximum at x = 4, after which it starts to decrease.

Example 1
Estimate the derivative u′(2) using Table 14.1 and explain what the answer means in terms of
temperature.
Solution
The derivative u′(2) is deﬁned as a limit of difference quotients:
u′(2) = lim
h→0
u(2 + h) −u(2)
h
.
Choosing h = 1 so that we can use the data in Table 14.1, we get
u′(2) ≈u(2 + 1) −u(2)
1
= 160 −135

= 25.
This means that the temperature increases at a rate of approximately 25◦C per meter as we go from
left to right, past x = 2.
Rate of Change of Temperature in a Metal Plate
Imagine an unevenly heated thin rectangular metal plate lying in the xy-plane with its lower left
corner at the origin and x and y measured in meters. The temperature (in ◦C) at the point (x, y) is
T (x, y). See Figure 14.2 and Table 14.2. How does T vary near the point (2, 1)? We consider the
horizontal line y = 1 containing the point (2, 1). The temperature along this line is the cross section,
T (x, 1), of the function T (x, y) with y = 1. Suppose we write u(x) = T (x, 1).

What is the meaning of the derivative u′(2)? It is the rate of change of temperature T in the
x-direction at the point (2, 1), keeping y ﬁxed. Denote this rate of change by Tx(2, 1), so that
Tx(2, 1) = u′(2) = lim

14.1 THE PARTIAL DERIVATIVE
759
We call Tx(2, 1) the partial derivative of T with respect to x at the point (2, 1). Taking h = 1, we
can read values of T from the row with y = 1 in Table 14.2, giving
Tx(2, 1) ≈T (3, 1) −T (2, 1)
1
= 160 −135
1
= 25◦C/m.
The fact that Tx(2, 1) is positive means that the temperature of the plate is increasing as we move
past the point (2, 1) in the direction of increasing x (that is, horizontally from left to right in Fig-
ure 14.2).
Example 2
Estimate the rate of change of T in the y-direction at the point (2, 1).
Solution
The temperature along the line x = 2 is the cross-section of T with x = 2, that is, the function
v(y) = T (2, y). If we denote the rate of change of T in the y-direction at (2, 1) by Ty(2, 1), then
Ty(2, 1) = v′(1) = lim
h→0
v(1 + h) −v(1)
h
= lim
h→0
T (2, 1 + h) −T (2, 1)
h
.
We call Ty(2, 1) the partial derivative of T with respect to y at the point (2, 1). Taking h = 1 so
that we can use the column with x = 2 in Table 14.2, we get
Ty(2, 1) ≈T (2, 1 + 1) −T (2, 1)
1
= 120 −135
1
= −15◦C/m.
The fact that Ty(2, 1) is negative means that the temperature decreases as y increases.
Definition of the Partial Derivative
We study the inﬂuence of x and y separately on the value of the function f(x, y) by holding one
ﬁxed and letting the other vary. This leads to the following deﬁnitions.
Partial Derivatives of f With Respect to x and y
For all points at which the limits exist, we deﬁne the partial derivatives at the point (a, b)
by
fx(a, b) =
Rate of change of f with respect to x
at the point (a, b)
= lim
h→0
f(a + h, b) −f(a, b)

,
fy(a, b) =
Rate of change of f with respect to y
at the point (a, b)
= lim
h→0
f(a, b + h) −f(a, b)
h
.
If we let a and b vary, we have the partial derivative functions fx(x, y) and fy(x, y).
Just as with ordinary derivatives, there is an alternative notation:
Alternative Notation for Partial Derivatives
If z = f(x, y), we can write
fx(x, y) = ∂z
∂x
and
fy(x, y) = ∂z
∂y,
fx(a, b) = ∂z

Chapter Fourteen DIFFERENTIATING FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES
We use the symbol ∂to distinguish partial derivatives from ordinary derivatives. In cases where
the independent variables have names different from x and y, we adjust the notation accordingly.
For example, the partial derivatives of f(u, v) are denoted by fu and fv.
Visualizing Partial Derivatives on a Graph
The ordinary derivative of a one-variable function is the slope of its graph. How do we visualize
the partial derivative fx(a, b)? The graph of the one-variable function f(x, b) is the curve where the
vertical plane y = b cuts the graph of f(x, y). (See Figure 14.3.) Thus, fx(a, b) is the slope of the
tangent line to this curve at x = a.

Similarly, the graph of the function f(a, y) is the curve where the vertical plane x = a cuts the
graph of f, and the partial derivative fy(a, b) is the slope of this curve at y = b. (See Figure 14.4.)

Solution
The positive x-axis points out of the page. Imagine heading off in this direction from the point
marked P; we descend steeply. So the partial derivative with respect to x is negative at P, with
quite a large absolute value. The same is true for the partial derivative with respect to y at P, since
there is also a steep descent in the positive y-direction.
At the point marked Q, heading in the positive x-direction results in a gentle descent, whereas
heading in the positive y-direction results in a gentle ascent. Thus, the partial derivative fx at Q is
negative but small (that is, near zero), and the partial derivative fy is positive but small.
Estimating Partial Derivatives from a Contour Diagram
The graph of a function f(x, y) often makes clear the sign of the partial derivatives. However,
numerical estimates of these derivatives are more easily made from a contour diagram than a surface
graph. If we move parallel to one of the axes on a contour diagram, the partial derivative is the rate
of change of the value of the function on the contours. For example, if the values on the contours
are increasing as we move in the positive direction, then the partial derivative must be positive.

Example 4
Figure 14.6 shows the contour diagram for the temperature H(x, t) (in ◦C) in a room as a function
of distance x (in meters) from a heater and time t (in minutes) after the heater has been turned on.
What are the signs of Hx(10, 20) and Ht(10, 20)? Estimate these partial derivatives and explain the
answers in practical terms.

Figure 14.6: Temperature in a heated room: Heater at x = 0 is turned on at t = 0
Solution
The point (10, 20) is nearly on the H = 25 contour. As x increases, we move toward the H = 20
contour, so H is decreasing and Hx(10, 20) is negative. This makes sense because the H = 30
contour is to the left: As we move further from the heater, the temperature drops. On the other hand,
as t increases, we move toward the H = 30 contour, so H is increasing; as t decreases H decreases.
Thus, Ht(10, 20) is positive. This says that as time passes, the room warms up.
To estimate the partial derivatives, use a difference quotient. Looking at the contour diagram,
we see there is a point on the H = 20 contour about 14 units to the right of the point (10, 20).
Hence, H decreases by 5 when x increases by 14, so we ﬁnd
Rate of change of H with respect to x = Hx(10, 20) ≈−5
14 ≈−0.36◦C/meter.
This means that near the point 10 m from the heater, after 20 minutes the temperature drops
about 0.36, or one third, of a degree, for each meter we move away from the heater.
To estimate Ht(10, 20), we notice that the H = 30 contour is about 32 units directly above the
point (10, 20). So H increases by 5 when t increases by 32. Hence,
Rate of change of H with respect to t = Ht(10, 20) ≈5
32 = 0.16◦C/minute.
This means that after 20 minutes the temperature is going up about 0.16, or 1/6, of a degree each
minute at the point 10 m from the heater.
Using Units to Interpret Partial Derivatives
The meaning of a partial derivative can often be explained using units.
Example 5
Suppose that your weight w in pounds is a function f(c, n) of the number c of calories you consume
daily and the number n of minutes you exercise daily. Using the units for w, c and n, interpret in
everyday terms the statements
∂w
∂c (2000, 15) = 0.02
and
∂w
∂n (2000, 15) = −0.025.
Solution
The units of ∂w/∂c are pounds per calorie. The statement
∂w
∂c (2000, 15) = 0.02
means that if you are presently consuming 2000 calories daily and exercising 15 minutes daily, you

762
Chapter Fourteen DIFFERENTIATING FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES
will weigh 0.02 pounds more for each extra calorie you consume daily, or about 2 pounds for each
extra 100 calories per day. The units of ∂w/∂n are pounds per minute. The statement
∂w
∂n (2000, 15) = −0.025
means that for the same calorie consumption and number of minutes of exercise, you will weigh
0.025 pounds less for each extra minute you exercise daily, or about 1 pound less for each extra
40 minutes per day. So if you eat an extra 100 calories each day and exercise about 80 minutes more
each day, your weight should remain roughly steady.

34. The cardiac output, represented by c, is the volume of
blood ﬂowing through a person’s heart per unit time. The
systemic vascular resistance (SVR), represented by s, is
the resistance to blood ﬂowing through veins and arteries.
Let p be a person’s blood pressure. Then p is a function
of c and s, so p = f(c, s).
(a) What does ∂p/∂c represent?
Suppose now that p = kcs, where k is a constant.
(b) Sketch the level curves of p. What do they represent?
Label your axes.
(c) For a person with a weak heart, it is desirable to
have the heart pumping against less resistance, while
maintaining the same blood pressure. Such a per-
son may be given the drug nitroglycerine to decrease
the SVR and the drug Dopamine to increase the car-
diac output. Represent this on a graph showing level
curves. Put a point A on the graph representing the
person’s state before drugs are given and a point B
for after.
(d) Right after a heart attack, a patient’s cardiac output
drops, thereby causing the blood pressure to drop. A
common mistake made by medical residents is to get
the patient’s blood pressure back to normal by using
drugs to increase the SVR, rather than by increasing
the cardiac output. On a graph of the level curves of
p, put a point D representing the patient before the
heart attack, a point E representing the patient right

after the heart attack, and a third point F represent-
ing the patient after the resident has given the drugs
to increase the SVR.

In Problems 36–37, explain what is wrong with the statement.
36. For f(x, y), ∂f/∂x has the same units as ∂f/∂y.
37. The partial derivative with respect to y is not deﬁned for
functions such as f(x, y) = x2 + 5 that have a formula
that does not contain y explicitly.
In Problems 38–39, give an example of:
38. A table of values with three rows and three columns of a
linear function f(x, y) with fx < 0 and fy > 0.
39. A function f(x, y) with fx > 0 and fy < 0 everywhere.
Are the statements in Problems 40–49 true or false? Give rea-
sons for your answer.
40. If f(x, y) is a function of two variables and fx(10, 20)
is deﬁned, then fx(10, 20) is a scalar.
41. If f(x, y) = x2 + y2, then fy(1, 1) < 0.
42. If the graph of f(x, y) is a hemisphere centered at the
origin, then fx(0, 0) = fy(0, 0) = 0.
43. If P = f(T, V ) is a function expressing the pressure P
(in grams/cm3) of gas in a piston in terms of the tem-
perature T (in degrees ◦C) and volume V (in cm3), then
∂P/∂V has units of grams.
44. If fx(a, b) > 0, then the values of f decrease as we move
in the negative x-direction near (a, b).
45. If g(r, s) = r2 + s, then for ﬁxed s, the partial derivative
gr increases as r increases.
46. If g(u, v) = (u + v)u, then 2.3 ≤gu(1, 1) ≤2.4.
47. Let P = f(m, d) be the purchase price (in dollars) of
a used car that has m miles on its engine and originally
cost d dollars when new. Then ∂P/∂m and ∂P/∂d have
the same sign.
48. If f(x, y) is a function with the property that fx(x, y)
and fy(x, y) are both constant, then f is linear.
49. If f(x, y) has fx(a, b) = fy(a, b) = 0 at the point (a, b),
then f is constant everywhere.
14.2
COMPUTING PARTIAL DERIVATIVES ALGEBRAICALLY
Since the partial derivative fx(x, y) is the ordinary derivative of the function f(x, y) with y held
constant and fy(x, y) is the ordinary derivative of f(x, y) with x held constant, we can use all the
differentiation formulas from one-variable calculus to ﬁnd partial derivatives.
Example 1
Let f(x, y) =
x2
y + 1. Find fx(3, 2) algebraically.
Solution
We use the fact that fx(3, 2) equals the derivative of f(x, 2) at x = 3. Since
f(x, 2) =
x2
2 + 1 = x2
3 ,
differentiating with respect to x, we have
fx(x, 2) = ∂
∂x
x2
3

= 2x
3 ,
and so
fx(3, 2) = 2.
Example 2
Compute the partial derivatives with respect to x and with respect to y for the following functions.
(a)
f(x, y) = y2e3x
(b)
z = (3xy + 2x)5
(c)
g(x, y) = ex+3y sin(xy)
Solution
(a) This is the product of a function of x (namely e3x) and a function of y (namely y2). When we
differentiate with respect to x, we think of the function of y as a constant, and vice versa. Thus,
fx(x, y) = y2 ∂
∂x

e3x
= 3y2e3x,
fy(x, y) = e3x ∂
∂y(y2) = 2ye3x.

14.2 COMPUTING PARTIAL DERIVATIVES ALGEBRAICALLY
767
(b) Here we use the chain rule:
∂z
∂x = 5(3xy + 2x)4 ∂
∂x(3xy + 2x) = 5(3xy + 2x)4(3y + 2),
∂z
∂y = 5(3xy + 2x)4 ∂
∂y (3xy + 2x) = 5(3xy + 2x)43x = 15x(3xy + 2x)4.
(c) Since each function in the product is a function of both x and y, we need to use the product rule
for each partial derivative:
gx(x, y) =
 ∂
∂x(ex+3y)

sin(xy) + ex+3y ∂
∂x(sin(xy)) = ex+3y sin(xy) + ex+3yy cos(xy),
gy(x, y) =
 ∂
∂y(ex+3y)

sin(xy) + ex+3y ∂
∂y(sin(xy)) = 3ex+3y sin(xy) + ex+3yx cos(xy).
For functions of three or more variables, we ﬁnd partial derivatives by the same method: Dif-
ferentiate with respect to one variable, regarding the other variables as constants. For a function
f(x, y, z), the partial derivative fx(a, b, c) gives the rate of change of f with respect to x along the
line y = b, z = c.
Example 3
Find all the partial derivatives of f(x, y, z) = x2y3
z
.
Solution
To ﬁnd fx(x, y, z), for example, we consider y and z as ﬁxed, giving
fx(x, y, z) = 2xy3
z
,
and
fy(x, y, z) = 3x2y2
z
,
and
fz(x, y, z) = −x2y3

Solution
Differentiating f(x, t) = 0.003 sin(πx) sin(2765t) with respect to x, we have
fx(x, t) = 0.003π cos(πx) sin(2765t).
In particular, substituting x = 0.3 and t = 1 gives
fx(0.3, 1) = 0.003π cos(π(0.3)) sin(2765) ≈0.002.

Chapter Fourteen DIFFERENTIATING FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES
To see what fx(0.3, 1) means, think about the function f(x, 1). The graph of f(x, 1) in Figure 14.19
is a snapshot of the string at the time t = 1. Thus, the derivative fx(0.3, 1) is the slope of the string
at the point x = 0.3 at the instant when t = 1.
Similarly, taking the derivative of f(x, t) = 0.003 sin(πx) sin(2765t) with respect to t, we get
ft(x, t) = (0.003)(2765) sin(πx) cos(2765t) = 8.3 sin(πx) cos(2765t).
Since f(x, t) is in meters and t is in seconds, the derivative ft(0.3, 1) is in m/sec. Thus, substituting
x = 0.3 and t = 1,
ft(0.3, 1) = 8.3 sin(π(0.3)) cos(2765(1)) ≈6 m/sec.

To see what ft(0.3, 1) means, think about the function f(0.3, t). The graph of f(0.3, t) is a posi-
tion versus time graph that tracks the up-and-downmovement of the point on the string where x = 0.3.
(See Figure 14.20.) The derivative ft(0.3, 1) = 6 m/sec is the velocity of that point on the string at
time t = 1. The fact that ft(0.3, 1) is positive indicates that the point is moving upward when t = 1.

14.3
LOCAL LINEARITY AND THE DIFFERENTIAL
In Sections 14.1 and 14.2 we studied a function of two variables by allowing one variable at a time
to change. We now let both variables change at once to develop a linear approximation for functions
of two variables.
Zooming In to See Local Linearity
For a function of one variable, local linearity means that as we zoom in on the graph, it looks like a
straight line. As we zoom in on the graph of a two-variable function, the graph usually looks like a
plane, which is the graph of a linear function of two variables. (See Figure 14.22.)
-
-
Figure 14.22: Zooming in on the graph of a function of two variables until the graph looks like a plane
Similarly, Figure 14.23 shows three successive views of the contours near a point. As we zoom
in, the contours look more like equally spaced parallel lines, which are the contours of a linear
function. (As we zoom in, we have to add more contours.)
Figure 14.23: Zooming in on a contour diagram until the lines look parallel and equally spaced
This effect can also be seen numerically by zooming in with tables of values. Table 14.4 shows
three tables of values for f(x, y) = x2 + y3 near x = 2, y = 1, each one a closer view than the
previous one. Notice how each table looks more like the table of a linear function.

Chapter Fourteen DIFFERENTIATING FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES
Zooming in Algebraically: Differentiability
Seeing a plane when we zoom in at a point tells us (provided the plane is not vertical) that f(x, y)
is closely approximated near that point by a linear function, L(x, y):
f(x, y) ≈L(x, y).
The graph of the function z = L(x, y) is the tangent plane at that point. Provided the approximation
is sufﬁciently good, we say that f(x, y) is differentiable at the point. Section 14.8 on page 815
deﬁnes precisely what is meant by the approximation being sufﬁciently good. The functions we
encounter are differentiable at most points in their domain.
The Tangent Plane
The plane that we see when we zoom in on a surface is called the tangent plane to the surface at the
point. Figure 14.24 shows the graph of a function with a tangent plane.
What is the equation of the tangent plane? At the point (a, b), the x-slope of the graph of f is
the partial derivative fx(a, b) and the y-slope is fy(a, b). Thus, using the equation for a plane on
page 694 of Chapter 12, we have the following result:
Tangent Plane to the Surface z = f(x, y) at the Point (a, b)
Assuming f is differentiable at (a, b), the equation of the tangent plane is
z = f(a, b) + fx(a, b)(x −a) + fy(a, b)(y −b).
Here we are thinking of a and b as ﬁxed, so f(a, b), and fx(a, b), and fy(a, b) are constants.
Thus, the right side of the equation is a linear function of x and y.

Example 1
Find the equation for the tangent plane to the surface z = x2 + y2 at the point (3, 4).
Solution
We have fx(x, y) = 2x, so fx(3, 4) = 6, and fy(x, y) = 2y, so fy(3, 4) = 8. Also, f(3, 4) =
32 + 42 = 25. Thus, the equation for the tangent plane at (3, 4) is
z = 25 + 6(x −3) + 8(y −4).

14.3 LOCAL LINEARITY AND THE DIFFERENTIAL
773
Local Linearization
Since the tangent plane lies close to the surface near the point at which they meet, z-values on the
tangent plane are close to values of f(x, y) for points near (a, b). Thus, replacing z by f(x, y) in
the equation of the tangent plane, we get the following approximation:
Tangent Plane Approximation to f(x, y) for (x, y) Near the Point (a, b)
Provided f is differentiable at (a, b), we can approximate f(x, y):
f(x, y) ≈f(a, b) + fx(a, b)(x −a) + fy(a, b)(y −b).
We are thinking of a and b as ﬁxed, so the expression on the right side is linear in x and y.
The right side of this approximation gives the local linearization of f near x = a, y = b.
Figure 14.25 shows the tangent plane approximation graphically.

Find the local linearization of f(x, y) = x2 +y2 at the point (3, 4). Estimate f(2.9, 4.2) and f(2, 2)
using the linearization and compare your answers to the true values.
Solution
Let z = f(x, y) = x2 + y2. In Example 1 on page 772, we found the equation of the tangent plane
at (3, 4) to be
z = 25 + 6(x −3) + 8(y −4).
Therefore, for (x, y) near (3, 4), we have the local linearization
f(x, y) ≈25 + 6(x −3) + 8(y −4).

774
Chapter Fourteen DIFFERENTIATING FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES
Substituting x = 2.9, y = 4.2 gives
f(2.9, 4.2) ≈25 + 6(−0.1) + 8(0.2) = 26.
This compares favorably with the true value f(2.9, 4.2) = (2.9)2 + (4.2)2 = 26.05.
However, the local linearization does not give a good approximation at points far away from
(3, 4). For example, if x = 2, y = 2, the local linearization gives
f(2, 2) ≈25 + 6(−1) + 8(−2) = 3,
whereas the true value of the function is f(2, 2) = 22 + 22 = 8.
Example 3
Designing safe boilers depends on knowing how steam behaves under changes in temperature and
pressure. Steam tables, such as Table 14.5, are published giving values of the function V = f(T, P)
where V is the volume (in ft3) of one pound of steam at a temperature T (in ◦F) and pressure P (in
lb/in2).
(a) Give a linear function approximating V = f(T, P) for T near 500◦F and P near 24 lb/in2.

Solution
(a) We want the local linearization around the point T = 500, P = 24, which is
f(T, P) ≈f(500, 24) + fT (500, 24)(T −500) + fP (500, 24)(P −24).
We read the value f(500, 24) = 23.69 from the table.
Next we approximate fT (500, 24) by a difference quotient. From the P = 24 column, we
compute the average rate of change between T = 500 and T = 520:
fT (500, 24) ≈f(520, 24) −f(500, 24)
520 −500
= 24.20 −23.69
20
= 0.0255.
Note that fT (500, 24) is positive, because steam expands when heated.
Next we approximate fP (500, 24) by looking at the T = 500 row and computing the
average rate of change between P = 24 and P = 26:
fP (500, 24) ≈f(500, 26) −f(500, 24)
26 −24
= 21.86 −23.69
2
= −0.915.
Note that fP (500, 24) is negative, because increasing the pressure on steam decreases its vol-
ume. Using these approximations for the partial derivatives, we obtain the local linearization:
V = f(T, P) ≈23.69 + 0.0255(T −500) −0.915(P −24) ft3
for T near 500 ◦F
and P near 24 lb/in2.

14.3 LOCAL LINEARITY AND THE DIFFERENTIAL
775
(b) We are interested in the volume at T = 505◦F and P = 24.3 lb/in2. Since these values are close
to T = 500◦F and P = 24 lb/in2, we use the linear relation obtained in part (a).
V ≈23.69 + 0.0255(505 −500) −0.915(24.3 −24) = 23.54 ft3.
Local Linearity with Three or More Variables
Local linear approximations for functions of three or more variables follow the same pattern as for
functions of two variables. The local linearization of f(x, y, z) at (a, b, c) is given by
f(x, y, z) ≈f(a, b, c) + fx(a, b, c)(x −a) + fy(a, b, c)(y −b) + fz(a, b, c)(z −c).
The Differential
We are often interested in the change in the value of the function as we move from the point (a, b)
to a nearby point (x, y). Then we use the notation
Δf = f(x, y) −f(a, b)
and
Δx = x −a
and
Δy = y −b
to rewrite the tangent plane approximation
f(x, y) ≈f(a, b) + fx(a, b)(x −a) + fy(a, b)(y −b)
in the form
Δf ≈fx(a, b)Δx + fy(a, b)Δy.
For ﬁxed a and b, the right side of this is a linear function of Δx and Δy that can be used to estimate
Δf. We call this linear function the differential. To deﬁne the differential in general, we introduce
new variables dx and dy to represent changes in x and y.
The Differential of a Function z = f(x, y)
The differential, df (or dz), at a point (a, b) is the linear function of dx and dy given by the
formula
df = fx(a, b) dx + fy(a, b) dy.
The differential at a general point is often written df = fx dx + fy dy.
Note that the differential, df, is a function of four variables a, b, and dx, dy.
Example 4
Compute the differentials of the following functions.
(a)
f(x, y) = x2e5y
(b)
z = x sin(xy)
(c)
f(x, y) = x cos(2x)
Solution
(a) Since fx(x, y) = 2xe5y and fy(x, y) = 5x2e5y, we have
df = 2xe5y dx + 5x2e5y dy.
(b) Since ∂z/∂x = sin(xy) + xy cos(xy) and ∂z/∂y = x2 cos(xy), we have
dz = (sin(xy) + xy cos(xy)) dx + x2 cos(xy) dy.
(c) Since fx(x, y) = cos(2x) −2x sin(2x) and fy(x, y) = 0, we have
df = (cos(2x) −2x sin(2x)) dx + 0 dy = (cos(2x) −2x sin(2x)) dx.

pressure P (in atmospheres). The ideal gas model for CO2 gives what is called the state equation:
ρ =
0.5363P
T + 273.15.
Compute the differential dρ. Explain the signs of the coefﬁcients of dT and dP.
Solution
The differential for ρ = f(T, P) is
dρ = fT (T, P) dT + fP (T, P)dP =
−0.5363P
(T + 273.15)2 dT +
0.5363
T + 273.15 dP.
The coefﬁcient of dT is negative because increasing the temperature expands the gas (if the pressure
is kept constant) and therefore decreases its density. The coefﬁcient of dP is positive because in-
creasing the pressure compresses the gas (if the temperature is kept constant) and therefore increases
its density.
Where Does the Notation for the Differential Come From?
We write the differential as a linear function of the new variables dx and dy. You may wonder why
we chose these names for our variables. The reason is historical: The people who invented calculus
thought of dx and dy as “inﬁnitesimal” changes in x and y. The equation
df = fxdx + fydy
was regarded as an inﬁnitesimal version of the local linear approximation
Δf ≈fxΔx + fyΔy.
In spite of the problems with deﬁning exactly what “inﬁnitesimal” means, some mathematicians,
scientists, and engineers think of the differential in terms of inﬁnitesimals.
Figure 14.26 illustrates a way of thinking about differentials that combines the deﬁnition with
this informal point of view. It shows the graph of f along with a view of the graph around the point
(a, b, f(a, b)) under a microscope. Since f is locally linear at the point, the magniﬁed view looks
like the tangent plane. Under the microscope, we use a magniﬁed coordinate system with its origin
at the point (a, b, f(a, b)) and with coordinates dx, dy, and dz along the three axes. The graph of
the differential df is the tangent plane, which has equation dz = fx(a, b) dx + fy(a, b) dy in the
magniﬁed coordinates.

The Rate of Change in an Arbitrary Direction: The Directional Derivative
The partial derivatives of a function f tell us the rate of change of f in the directions parallel to
the coordinate axes. In this section we see how to compute the rate of change of f in an arbitrary
direction.
Example 1
Figure 14.28 shows the temperature, in ◦C, at the point (x, y). Estimate the average rate of change
of temperature as we walk from point A to point B.

Figure 14.28: Estimating rate of change on a temperature map
Solution
At the point A we are on the H = 45◦C contour. At B we are on the H = 50◦C contour. The
displacement vector from A to B has x component approximately −100⃗i and y component ap-
proximately 25⃗j , so its length is

(−100)2 + 252 ≈103. Thus, the temperature rises by 5◦C as
we move 103 meters, so the average rate of change of the temperature in that direction is about
5/103 ≈0.05◦C/m.
Suppose we want to compute the rate of change of a function f(x, y) at the point P = (a, b) in
the direction of the unit vector ⃗u = u1⃗i +u2⃗j . For h > 0, consider the point Q = (a+hu1, b+hu2)
whose displacement from P is h⃗u . (See Figure 14.29.) Since ∥⃗u ∥= 1, the distance from P to Q is
h. Thus,

Taking the limit as h →0 gives the instantaneous rate of change and the following deﬁnition:
Directional Derivative of f at (a, b) in the Direction of a Unit Vector ⃗u
If ⃗u = u1⃗i + u2⃗j is a unit vector, we deﬁne the directional derivative, f⃗u , by
f⃗u (a, b) =
Rate of change
of f in direction

provided the limit exists.
Notice that if ⃗u =⃗i , so u1 = 1, u2 = 0, then the directional derivative is fx, since
f⃗i (a, b) = lim
h→0
f(a + h, b) −f(a, b)
h
= fx(a, b).
Similarly, if ⃗u = ⃗j then the directional derivative f⃗j = fy.
What If We Do Not Have a Unit Vector?
We deﬁned f⃗u for ⃗u a unit vector. If ⃗v is not a unit vector, ⃗v ̸= ⃗0 , we construct a unit vector
⃗u = ⃗v /∥⃗v ∥in the same direction as ⃗v and deﬁne the rate of change of f in the direction of ⃗v
as f⃗u .
Example 2
For each of the functions f, g, and h in Figure 14.30, decide whether the directional derivative at
the indicated point is positive, negative, or zero, in the direction of the vector ⃗v = ⃗i + 2⃗j , and in
the direction of the vector ⃗w = 2⃗i +⃗j .

Figure 14.30: Contour diagrams of three functions with direction vectors ⃗v =⃗i + 2⃗j and ⃗w = 2⃗i +⃗j marked on each
Solution
On the contour diagram for f, the vector ⃗v =⃗i + 2⃗j appears to be tangent to the contour. Thus, in
this direction, the value of the function is not changing, so the directional derivative in the direction
of ⃗v is zero. The vector ⃗w = 2⃗i +⃗j points from the contour marked 4 toward the contour marked
5. Thus, the values of the function are increasing and the directional derivative in the direction of ⃗w
is positive.

14.4 GRADIENTS AND DIRECTIONAL DERIVATIVES IN THE PLANE
781
On the contour diagram for g, the vector ⃗v =⃗i + 2⃗j points from the contour marked 6 toward
the contour marked 5, so the function is decreasing in that direction. Thus, the rate of change is
negative. On the other hand, the vector ⃗w = 2⃗i +⃗j points from the contour marked 6 toward the
contour marked 7, and hence the directional derivative in the direction of ⃗w is positive.
Finally, on the contour diagram for h, both vectors point from the h = 10 contour to the h = 9
contour, so both directional derivatives are negative.
Example 3
Calculate the directional derivative of f(x, y) = x2+y2 at (1, 0) in the direction of the vector⃗i +⃗j .
Solution
First we have to ﬁnd the unit vector in the same direction as the vector⃗i +⃗j . Since this vector has

⃗u =

Computing Directional Derivatives from Partial Derivatives
If f is differentiable, we will now see how to use local linearity to ﬁnd a formula for the directional
derivative which does not involve a limit. If ⃗u is a unit vector, the deﬁnition of f⃗u says
f⃗u (a, b) = lim
h→0
f(a + hu1, b + hu2) −f(a, b)
h
= lim
h→0
Δf
h ,
where Δf = f(a + hu1, b + hu2) −f(a, b) is the change in f. We write Δx for the change in x,
so Δx = (a + hu1) −a = hu1; similarly Δy = hu2. Using local linearity, we have
Δf ≈fx(a, b)Δx + fy(a, b)Δy = fx(a, b)hu1 + fy(a, b)hu2.
Thus, dividing by h gives
Δf
h
≈fx(a, b)hu1 + fy(a, b)hu2
h
= fx(a, b)u1 + fy(a, b)u2.
This approximation becomes exact as h →0, so we have the following formula:
f⃗u (a, b) = fx(a, b)u1 + fy(a, b)u2.
Example 4
Use the preceding formula to compute the directional derivative in Example 3. Check that we get
the same answer as before.
Solution
We calculate f⃗u (1, 0), where f(x, y) = x2 + y2 and ⃗u =

The partial derivatives are fx(x, y) = 2x and fy(x, y) = 2y. So, as before,

The Gradient Vector
Notice that the expression for f⃗u (a, b) can be written as a dot product of ⃗u and a new vector:
f⃗u (a, b) = fx(a, b)u1 + fy(a, b)u2 = (fx(a, b)⃗i + fy(a, b)⃗j ) · (u1⃗i + u2⃗j ).

782
Chapter Fourteen DIFFERENTIATING FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES
The new vector, fx(a, b)⃗i + fy(a, b)⃗j , turns out to be important. Thus, we make the following
deﬁnition:
The Gradient Vector of a differentiable function f at the point (a, b) is
gradf(a, b) = fx(a, b)⃗i + fy(a, b)⃗j
The formula for the directional derivative can be written in terms of the gradient as follows:
The Directional Derivative and the Gradient
If f is differentiable at (a, b) and ⃗u = u1⃗i + u2⃗j is a unit vector, then
f⃗u (a, b) = fx(a, b)u1 + fy(a, b)u2 = gradf(a, b) · ⃗u .
Example 5
Find the gradient vector of f(x, y) = x + ey at the point (1, 1).
Solution
Using the deﬁnition, we have
grad f = fx⃗i + fy⃗j =⃗i + ey⃗j ,
so at the point (1, 1)
grad f(1, 1) =⃗i + e⃗j .
Alternative Notation for the Gradient
You can think of ∂f
∂x
⃗i + ∂f
∂y
⃗j as the result of applying the vector operator (pronounced “del”)
∇= ∂
∂x
⃗i + ∂
∂y
⃗j
to the function f. Thus, we get the alternative notation
grad f = ∇f.
If z = f(x, y), we can write gradz or ∇z for gradf or for ∇f.
What Does the Gradient Tell Us?
The fact that f⃗u = gradf · ⃗u enables us to see what the gradient vector represents. Suppose θ is
the angle between the vectors gradf and ⃗u . At the point (a, b), we have
f⃗u = grad f · ⃗u = ∥gradf∥∥⃗u ∥

Imagine that gradf is ﬁxed and that ⃗u can rotate. (See Figure 14.31.) The maximum value of
f⃗u occurs when cos θ = 1, so θ = 0 and ⃗u is pointing in the direction of gradf. Then
Maximum f⃗u = ∥gradf∥cos0 = ∥gradf∥.
The minimum value of f⃗u occurs when cos θ = −1, so θ = π and ⃗u is pointing in the direction
opposite to grad f. Then
Minimum f⃗u = ∥gradf∥cosπ = −∥gradf∥.
When θ = π/2 or 3π/2, so cos θ = 0, the directional derivative is zero.
Properties of the Gradient Vector
We have seen that the gradient vector points in the direction of the greatest rate of change at a point
and the magnitude of the gradient vector is that rate of change.
Figure 14.32 shows that the gradient vector at a point is perpendicular to the contour through
that point. If the contours represent equally spaced f-values and f is differentiable, local linearity
tells us that the contours of f around a point appear straight, parallel, and equally spaced. The
greatest rate of change is obtained by moving in the direction that takes us to the next contour in the
shortest possible distance; that is, perpendicular to the contour. Thus, we have the following:
Geometric Properties of the Gradient Vector in the Plane
If f is a differentiable function at the point (a, b) and grad f(a, b) ̸= ⃗0 , then:
• The direction of gradf(a, b) is
· Perpendicular1 to the contour of f through (a, b);
· In the direction of the maximum rate of increase of f.
• The magnitude of the gradient vector, ∥gradf∥, is
· The maximum rate of change of f at that point;
· Large when the contours are close together and small when they are far apart.

Examples of Directional Derivatives and Gradient Vectors
Example 6
Explain why the gradient vectors at points A and C in Figure 14.33 have the direction and the
relative magnitudes they do.
Solution
The gradient vector points in the direction of greatest increase of the function. This means that
in Figure 14.33, the gradient points directly toward warmer temperatures. The magnitude of the
gradient vector measures the rate of change. The gradient vector at A is longer than the gradient
vector at C because the contours are closer together at A, so the rate of change is larger.
Example 2 on page 780 shows how the contour diagram can tell us the sign of the directional
derivative. In the next example we compute the directional derivative in three directions, two that
are close to that of the gradient vector and one that is not.
Example 7
Use the gradient to ﬁnd the directional derivative of f(x, y) = x + ey at the point (1, 1) in the
direction of the vectors⃗i −⃗j ,⃗i + 2⃗j ,⃗i + 3⃗j .
Solution
In Example 5 we found
grad f(1, 1) =⃗i + e⃗j .
A unit vector in the direction of⃗i −⃗j is ⃗s = (⃗i −⃗j )/

f⃗s (1, 1) = gradf(1, 1) · ⃗s = (⃗i + e⃗j ) ·
⃗i −⃗j

≈−1.215.
A unit vector in the direction of⃗i + 2⃗j is ⃗v = (⃗i + 2⃗j )/
√
5, so
f⃗v (1, 1) = grad f(1, 1) · ⃗v = (⃗i + e⃗j ) ·
⃗i + 2⃗j

≈2.879.
A unit vector in the direction of⃗i + 3⃗j is ⃗w = (⃗i + 3⃗j )/
√

f ⃗w (1, 1) = grad f(1, 1) · ⃗w = (⃗i + e⃗j ) ·
⃗i + 3⃗j
√


= 1 + 3e
√

≈2.895.
Now look back at the answers and compare with the value of ∥gradf∥=
√
1 + e2 ≈2.896.
One answer is not close to this value; the other two, f⃗v = 2.879 and f ⃗w = 2.895, are close but
slightly smaller than ∥gradf∥. Since ∥gradf∥is the maximum rate of change of f at the point,
we have for any unit vector ⃗u :
f⃗u (1, 1) ≤∥gradf∥.
with equality when ⃗u is in the direction of gradf. Since e ≈2.718, the vectors⃗i + 2⃗j and⃗i + 3⃗j
both point roughly, but not exactly, in the direction of the gradient vector gradf(1, 1) = ⃗i + e⃗j .
Thus, the values of f⃗v and f ⃗w are both close to the value of ∥gradf∥. The direction of the vector
⃗i −⃗j is not close to the direction of grad f and the value of f⃗s is not close to the value of ∥gradf∥.

GRADIENTS AND DIRECTIONAL DERIVATIVES IN SPACE
Directional Derivatives of Functions of Three Variables
We calculate directional derivatives of a function of three variables in the same way as for a function
of two variables. If the function f is differentiable at the point (a, b, c), then the rate of change of
f(x, y, z) at the point (a, b, c) in the direction of a unit vector ⃗u = u1⃗i + u2⃗j + u3⃗k is
f⃗u (a, b, c) = fx(a, b, c)u1 + fy(a, b, c)u2 + fz(a, b, c)u3.
This can be justiﬁed using local linearity in the same way as for functions of two variables.
Example 1
Find the directional derivative of f(x, y, z) = xy + z at the point (−1, 0, 1) in the direction of the
vector ⃗v = 2⃗i + ⃗k .
Solution
The magnitude of ⃗v is ∥⃗v ∥=

The partial derivatives of f are fx(x, y, z) = y and fy(x, y, z) = x and fz(x, y, z) = 1. Thus,
f⃗u (−1, 0, 1) = fx(−1, 0, 1)u1 + fy(−1, 0, 1)u2 + fz(−1, 0, 1)u3

The Gradient Vector of a Function of Three Variables
The gradient of a function of three variables is deﬁned in the same way as for two variables:
gradf(a, b, c) = fx(a, b, c)⃗i + fy(a, b, c)⃗j + fz(a, b, c)⃗k .
Directional derivatives are related to gradients in the same way as for functions of two variables:
f⃗u (a, b, c) = fx(a, b, c)u1 + fy(a, b, c)u2 + fz(a, b, c)u3 = grad f(a, b, c) · ⃗u .
Since gradf(a, b, c) · ⃗u = ∥gradf(a, b, c)∥cosθ, where θ is the angle between gradf(a, b, c)
and ⃗u , the value of f⃗u (a, b, c) is largest when θ = 0, that is, when ⃗u is in the same direction as
gradf(a, b, c). In addition, f⃗u (a, b, c) = 0 when θ = π/2, so grad f(a, b, c) is perpendicular to
the level surface of f. The properties of gradients in space are similar to those in the plane:

Chapter Fourteen DIFFERENTIATING FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES
Properties of the Gradient Vector in Space
If f is differentiable at (a, b, c) and ⃗u is a unit vector, then
f⃗u (a, b, c) = grad f(a, b, c) · ⃗u .
If, in addition, gradf(a, b, c) ̸= ⃗0 , then
• grad f(a, b, c) is in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of f
• grad f(a, b, c) is perpendicular to the level surface of f at (a, b, c)
• ∥gradf(a, b, c)∥is the maximum rate of change of f at (a, b, c).
Example 2
Let f(x, y, z) = x2 + y2 and g(x, y, z) = −x2 −y2 −z2. What can we say about the direction of
the following vectors?
(a)
grad f(0, 1, 1)
(b)
grad f(1, 0, 1)
(c)
grad g(0, 1, 1)
(d)
grad g(1, 0, 1).
Solution
The cylinder x2+y2 = 1 in Figure 14.42 is a level surface of f and contains both the points (0, 1, 1)
and (1, 0, 1). Since the value of f does not change at all in the z-direction, all the gradient vectors
are horizontal. They are perpendicular to the cylinder and point outward because the value of f
increases as we move out.
Similarly, the points (0, 1, 1) and (1, 0, 1) also lie on the same level surface of g, namely
g(x, y, z) = −x2 −y2 −z2 = −2, which is the sphere x2 + y2 + z2 = 2. Part of this level
surface is shown in Figure 14.43. This time the gradient vectors point inward, since the negative
signs mean that the function increases (from large negative values to small negative values) as we
move inward.

Example 3
Consider the functions f(x, y) = 4−x2−2y2 and g(x, y) = 4−x2. Calculate a vector perpendicular
to each of the following:
(a)
The level curve of f at the point (1, 1)
(b)
The surface z = f(x, y) at the point (1, 1, 1)
(c)
The level curve of g at the point (1, 1)
(d)
The surface z = g(x, y) at the point (1, 1, 3)
Solution
(a) The vector we want is a 2-vector in the plane. Since gradf = −2x⃗i −4y⃗j , we have
gradf(1, 1) = −2⃗i −4⃗j .
Any nonzero multiple of this vector is perpendicular to the level curve at the point (1, 1).
(b) In this case we want a 3-vector in space. To ﬁnd it we rewrite z = 4 −x2 −2y2 as the level
surface of the function F, where
F(x, y, z) = 4 −x2 −2y2 −z = 0.
Then
gradF = −2x⃗i −4y⃗j −⃗k ,

14.5 GRADIENTS AND DIRECTIONAL DERIVATIVES IN SPACE
791
so
gradF(1, 1, 1) = −2⃗i −4⃗j −⃗k ,
and gradF(1, 1, 1) is perpendicular to the surface z = 4−x2−2y2 at the point (1, 1, 1). Notice
that −2⃗i −4⃗j −⃗k is not the only possible answer: any multiple of this vector will do.
(c) We are looking for a 2-vector. Since gradg = −2x⃗i + 0⃗j , we have
gradg(1, 1) = −2⃗i .
Any multiple of this vector is perpendicular to the level curve also.
(d) We are looking for a 3-vector. We rewrite z = 4 −x2 as the level surface of the function G,
where
G(x, y, z) = 4 −x2 −z = 0.
Then
grad G = −2x⃗i −⃗k
So
grad G(1, 1, 3) = −2⃗i −⃗k ,
and any multiple of grad G(1, 1, 3) is perpendicular to the surface z = 4 −x2 at this point.
Example 4
(a) A hiker on the surface f(x, y) = 4 −x2 −2y2 at the point (1, −1, 1) starts to climb along
the path of steepest ascent. What is the relation between the vector gradf(1, −1) and a vector
tangent to the path at the point (1, −1, 1) and pointing uphill?
(b) At the point (1, −1, 1) on the surface f(x, y) = 4−x2−2y2, calculate a vector, ⃗n , perpendicular
to the surface and a vector, ⃗T , tangent to the curve of steepest ascent.

f(x, y) = 4 −x2 −2y2 showing path of

Solution
(a) The hiker at the point (1, −1, 1) lies directly above the point (1, −1) in the xy-plane. The vector
gradf(1, −1) lies in 2-space, pointing like a compass in the direction in which f increases
most rapidly. Therefore, grad f(1, −1) lies directly under a vector tangent to the hiker’s path at
(1, −1, 1) and pointing uphill. (See Figures 14.44 and 14.45.)

792
Chapter Fourteen DIFFERENTIATING FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES
(b) The surface is represented by F(x, y, z) = 4 −x2 −2y2 −z = 0. Since gradF = −2x⃗i −
4y⃗j −⃗k , the normal, ⃗n , to the surface is given by
⃗n = gradF(1, −1, 1) = −2(1)⃗i −4(−1)⃗j −⃗k = −2⃗i + 4⃗j −⃗k .
We take the⃗i and ⃗j components of ⃗T to be the vector gradf(1, −1) = −2⃗i + 4⃗j . Thus, we
have that, for some a > 0,
⃗T = −2⃗i + 4⃗j + a⃗k
We want ⃗n · ⃗T = 0, so
⃗n · ⃗T = (−2⃗i + 4⃗j −⃗k ) · (−2⃗i + 4⃗j + a⃗k ) = 4 + 16 −a = 0
So a = 20 and hence
⃗T = −2⃗i + 4⃗j + 20⃗k .
Example 5
Find the equation of the tangent plane to the sphere x2 + y2 + z2 = 14 at the point (1, 2, 3).
Solution
We write the sphere as a level surface as follows:
f(x, y, z) = x2 + y2 + z2 = 14.
We have
grad f = 2x⃗i + 2y⃗j + 2z⃗k ,
so the vector
grad f(1, 2, 3) = 2⃗i + 4⃗j + 6⃗k
is perpendicular to the sphere at the point (1, 2, 3). Since the vector gradf(1, 2, 3) is normal to the
tangent plane, the equation of the plane is
2x + 4y + 6z = 2 · 1 + 4 · 2 + 6 · 3 = 28
or
x + 2y + 3z = 14.
We could also try to ﬁnd the tangent plane to the level surface f(x, y, z) = k by solving
algebraically for z and using the method of Section 14.3, page 773. (See Problem 46.) Solving for
z can be difﬁcult or impossible, however, so the method of Example 5 is preferable.
Tangent Plane to a Level Surface
If f(x, y, z) is differentiable at (a, b, c), then an equation for the tangent plane to the level
surface of f at the point (a, b, c) is
fx(a, b, c)(x −a) + fy(a, b, c)(y −b) + fz(a, b, c)(z −c) = 0.
Caution: Scale on the Axis and the Geometric Interpretation of the Gradient
When we interpreted the gradient of a function geometrically (page 783), we tacitly assumed that
the units and scales along the x and y axes were the same. If the scales are not the same, the gradient
vector may not look perpendicular to the contours. Consider the function f(x, y) = x2 + y with
gradient vector gradf = 2x⃗i +⃗j . Figure 14.46 shows the gradient vector at (1, 1) using the same
scales in the x and y directions. As expected, the gradient vector is perpendicular to the contour
line. Figure 14.47 shows contours of the same function with unequal scales on the two axes. Notice
that the gradient vector no longer appears perpendicular to the contour lines. Thus, we see that the
geometric interpretation of the gradient vector requires that the same scale be used on both axes.

THE CHAIN RULE
Composition of Functions of Many Variables and Rates of Change
The chain rule enables us to differentiate composite functions. If we have a function of two variables
z = f(x, y) and we substitute x = g(t), y = h(t) into z = f(x, y), then we have a composite
function in which z is a function of t:
z = f(g(t), h(t)).
If, on the other hand, we substitute x = g(u, v), y = h(u, v), then we have a different composite
function in which z is a function of u and v:
z = f(g(u, v), h(u, v)).
The next example shows how to calculate the rate of change of a composite function.
Example 1
Corn production, C, depends on annual rainfall, R, and average temperature, T , so C = f(R, T).
Global warming predicts that both rainfall and temperature depend on time. Suppose that according
to a particular model of global warming, rainfall is decreasing at 0.2 cm per year and temperature
is increasing at 0.1◦C per year. Use the fact that at current levels of production, fR = 3.3 and
fT = −5 to estimate the current rate of change, dC/dt.

14.6 THE CHAIN RULE
797
Solution
By local linearity, we know that changes ΔR and ΔT generate a change, ΔC, in C given approxi-
mately by
ΔC ≈fRΔR + fT ΔT = 3.3ΔR −5ΔT.
We want to know how ΔC depends on the time increment, Δt. A change Δt causes changes ΔR
and ΔT , which in turn cause a change ΔC. The model of global warming tells us that
dR
dt = −0.2
and
dT
dt = 0.1.
Thus, a time increment, Δt, generates changes of ΔR and ΔT given by
ΔR ≈−0.2Δt
and
ΔT ≈0.1Δt.
Substituting for ΔR and ΔT in the expression for ΔC gives us
ΔC ≈3.3(−0.2Δt) −5(0.1Δt) = −1.16Δt.
Thus,
ΔC
Δt ≈−1.16
and, therefore,
dC
dt ≈−1.16.
The relationship between ΔC and Δt, which gives the value of dC/dt, is an example of the
chain rule. The argument in Example 1 leads to more general versions of the chain rule.
The Chain Rule for z = f(x, y), x = g(t), y = h(t)
Since z = f(g(t), h(t)) is a function of t, we can consider the derivative dz/dt. The chain rule
gives dz/dt in terms of the derivatives of f, g, and h. Since dz/dt represents the rate of change of z
with t, we look at the change Δz generated by a small change, Δt.
We substitute the local linearizations
Δx ≈dx
dt Δt
and
Δy ≈dy
dt Δt
into the local linearization
Δz ≈∂z
∂x Δx + ∂z
∂y Δy,
yielding
Δz ≈∂z

Thus,

Taking the limit as Δt →0, we get the following result.

Visualizing the Chain Rule with a Diagram
The diagram in Figure 14.50 provides a way of remembering the chain rule. It shows the chain of

of x and y on t
The diagram keeps track of how a change in t propagates through the chain of composed func-
tions. There are two paths from t to z, one through x and one through y. For each path, we multiply
together the derivatives along the path. Then, to calculate dz/dt, we add the contributions from the
two paths.
Example 2
Suppose that z = f(x, y) = x sin y, where x = t2 and y = 2t + 1. Let z = g(t). Compute g′(t)
directly and using the chain rule.
Solution
Since z = g(t) = f(t2, 2t + 1) = t2 sin(2t + 1), it is possible to compute g′(t) directly by one-
variable methods:
g′(t) = t2 d

sin(2t + 1) = 2t2 cos(2t + 1) + 2t sin(2t + 1).

How to Formulate a General Chain Rule
A diagram can be used to write the chain rule for general compositions.
To ﬁnd the rate of change of one variable with respect to another in a chain of composed
differentiable functions:
• Draw a diagram expressing the relationship between the variables, and label each link in
the diagram with the derivative relating the variables at its ends.
• For each path between the two variables, multiply together the derivatives from each step
along the path.
• Add the contributions from each path.
The diagram keeps track of all the ways in which a change in one variable can cause a change
in another; the diagram generates all the terms we would get from the appropriate substitutions into
the local linearizations.

Example 5
A quantity z can be expressed either as a function of x and y, so that z = f(x, y), or as a function
of u and v, so that z = g(u, v). The two coordinate systems are related by
x = u + v,
y = u −v.
(a) Use the chain rule to express ∂z/∂u and ∂z/∂v in terms of ∂z/∂x and ∂z/∂y.
(b) Solve the equations in part (a) for ∂z/∂x and ∂z/∂y.
(c) Show that the expressions we get in part (b) are the same as we get by expressing u and v in
terms of x and y and using the chain rule.
Solution
(a) We have ∂x/∂u = 1 and ∂x/∂v = 1, and also ∂y/∂u = 1 and ∂y/∂v = −1. Thus,
∂z
∂u = ∂z
∂x(1) + ∂z
∂y(1) = ∂z

and
∂z
∂v = ∂z
∂x(1) + ∂z
∂y(−1) = ∂z
∂x −∂z
∂y .
(b) Adding together the equations for ∂z/∂u and ∂z/∂v, we get

∂v = 2 ∂z
∂x,
so
∂z
∂x = 1

∂z

Similarly, subtracting the equations for ∂z/∂u and ∂z/∂v yields

x = u + v,
y = u −v
for u and v, which yields
u = 1
2x + 1
2y,
v = 1
2x −1
2y.
Now we can think of z as a function of u and v, and u and v as functions of x and y, and apply
the chain rule again. This gives us

An Application to Physical Chemistry
A chemist investigating the properties of a gas such as carbon dioxide may want to know how the
internal energy U of a given quantity of the gas depends on its temperature, T , pressure, P, and
volume, V . The three quantities T , P, and V are not independent, however. For instance, according
to the ideal gas law, they satisfy the equation
PV = kT
where k is a constant which depends only upon the quantity of the gas. The internal energy can then
be thought of as a function of any two of the three quantities T , P, and V :
U = U1(T, P) = U2(T, V ) = U3(P, V ).
The chemist writes, for example,

 ∂U
∂T

P to indicate the partial derivative of U with respect to
T holding P constant, signifying that for this computation U is viewed as a function of T and P.
Thus, we interpret
∂U
∂T

P
as
∂U
∂T

P
= ∂U1(T, P)
∂T
.
If U is to be viewed as a function of T and V , the chemist writes

 ∂U
∂T

V for the partial derivative
of U with respect to T holding V constant: thus,

 ∂U
∂T

V = ∂U2(T,V )
∂T
.
Each of the functions U1, U2, U3 gives rise to one of the following formulas for the differential
dU:

All the six partial derivatives appearing in formulas for dU have physical meaning, but they are not
all equally easy to measure experimentally. A relationship among the partial derivatives, usually
derived from the chain rule, may make it possible to evaluate one of the partials in terms of others
that are more easily measured.
Example 6
Suppose a gas satisﬁes the equation PV = 2T and P = 3 when V = 4. If

P

Solution
Since we know the values of

 ∂U
∂P

V and

 ∂U
∂V

P , we think of U as a function of P and V and use
the function U3 to write
dU =

dU = 7dP + 8dV.
To calculate

 ∂U
∂P

T and

 ∂U
∂T

P , we think of U as a function of T and P. Thus, we want to substitute
for dV in terms of dT and dP. Since PV = 2T , we have
PdV + V dP = 2dT,
3dV + 4dP = 2dT.

In Example 6, we could have substituted for dP instead of dV , leading to values of

In general, if for some particular P, V , and T , we can measure two of the six quantities

between dP, dV , and dT given by the gas law. General formulas for each partial derivative in terms
of others can be obtained in the same way. See the following example and Problem 41.

Solution
Since we are interested in the derivatives

 ∂U

We want to ﬁnd a formula for

Thus, we want to substitute for dV . Since V is a function of T and P, we have
dV =

Since the partial derivatives of a function are themselves functions, we can differentiate them, giving
second-order partial derivatives. A function z = f(x, y) has two ﬁrst-order partial derivatives, fx
and fy, and four second-order partial derivatives.

Example 1
Compute the four second-order partial derivatives of f(x, y) = xy2 + 3x2ey.
Solution
From fx(x, y) = y2 + 6xey we get
fxx(x, y) = ∂
∂x(y2 + 6xey) = 6ey
and
fxy(x, y) = ∂
∂y (y2 + 6xey) = 2y + 6xey.
From fy(x, y) = 2xy + 3x2ey we get
fyx(x, y) = ∂
∂x(2xy+3x2ey) = 2y+6xey
and
fyy(x, y) = ∂
∂y(2xy+3x2ey) = 2x+3x2ey.
Observe that fxy = fyx in this example.
Example 2
Use the values of the function f(x, y) in Table 14.6 to estimate fxy(1, 2) and fyx(1, 2).

= 22.3 −16.0

= 31.5.

The Mixed Partial Derivatives Are Equal
It is not an accident that the estimates for fxy(1, 2) and fyx(1, 2) are equal in Example 2, because the
same values of the function are used to calculate each one. The fact that fxy = fyx in Examples 1
and 2 corroborates the following general result; Problem 54 suggests why you might expect it to be
true.3
Theorem 14.1: Equality of Mixed Partial Derivatives
If fxy and fyx are continuous at (a, b), an interior point of their domain, then
fxy(a, b) = fyx(a, b).
3For a proof, see M. Spivak, Calculus on Manifolds, p. 26 (New York: Benjamin, 1965).

808
Chapter Fourteen DIFFERENTIATING FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES
For most functions f we encounter and most points (a, b) in their domains, not only are fxy
and fyx continuous at (a, b), but all their higher-order partial derivatives (such as fxxy or fxyyy)
exist and are continuous at (a, b). In that case we say f is smooth at (a, b). We say f is smooth on a
region R if it is smooth at every point of R.
What Do the Second-Order Partial Derivatives Tell Us?
Example 3
Let us return to the guitar string of Example 4, page 767. The string is 1 meter long and at time t
seconds, the point x meters from one end is displaced f(x, t) meters from its rest position, where
f(x, t) = 0.003 sin(πx) sin(2765t).
Compute the four second-order partial derivatives of f at the point (x, t) = (0.3, 1) and describe
the meaning of their signs in practical terms.
Solution
First we compute fx(x, t) = 0.003π cos(πx) sin(2765t), from which we get
fxx(x, t) = ∂
∂x(fx(x, t)) = −0.003π2 sin(πx) sin(2765t),
so
fxx(0.3, 1) ≈−0.01;
and
fxt(x, t) = ∂
∂t(fx(x, t)) = (0.003)(2765)π cos(πx) cos(2765t),
so
fxt(0.3, 1) ≈14.
On page 767 we saw thatfx(x, t) gives the slope of the string at any point and time. Therefore,
fxx(x, t) measures the concavity of the string. The fact that fxx(0.3, 1) < 0 means the string is
concave down at the point x = 0.3 when t = 1. (See Figure 14.55.)
On the other hand, fxt(x, t) is the rate of change of the slope of the string with respect to time.
Thus, fxt(0.3, 1) > 0 means that at time t = 1 the slope at the point x = 0.3 is increasing. (See
Figure 14.56.)

Now we compute ft(x, t) = (0.003)(2765) sin(πx) cos(2765t), from which we get
ftx(x, t) = ∂
∂x(ft(x, t)) = (0.003)(2765)π cos(πx) cos(2765t),
so
ftx(0.3, 1) ≈14
and
ftt(x, t) = ∂
∂t(ft(x, t)) = −(0.003)(2765)2 sin(πx) sin(2765t),
so
ftt(0.3, 1) ≈−7200.
On page 767 we saw that ft(x, t) gives the velocity of the string at any point and time. There-
fore, ftx(x, t) and ftt(x, t) will both be rates of change of velocity. That ftx(0.3, 1) > 0 means that

14.7 SECOND-ORDER PARTIAL DERIVATIVES
809
at time t = 1 the velocities of points just to the right of x = 0.3 are greater than the velocity at
x = 0.3. (See Figure 14.57.) That ftt(0.3, 1) < 0 means that the velocity of the point x = 0.3 is
decreasing at time t = 1. Thus, ftt(0.3, 1) = −7200 m/sec2 is the acceleration of this point. (See

Taylor Approximations
We use second derivatives to construct quadratic Taylor approximations. In Section 14.3, we saw
how to approximate f(x, y) by a linear function (its local linearization). We now see how to improve
this approximation of f(x, y) using a quadratic function.
Linear and Quadratic Approximations Near (0,0)
For a function of one variable, local linearity tells us that the best linear approximation is the
degree-1 Taylor polynomial
f(x) ≈f(a) + f ′(a)(x −a)
for x near a.
A better approximation to f(x) is given by the degree-2 Taylor polynomial:
f(x) ≈f(a) + f ′(a)(x −a) + f ′′(a)
2
(x −a)2
for x near a.
For a function of two variables the local linearization for (x, y) near (a, b) is
f(x, y) ≈L(x, y) = f(a, b) + fx(a, b)(x −a) + fy(a, b)(y −b).
In the case (a, b) = (0, 0), we have:
Taylor Polynomial of Degree 1 Approximating f(x, y) for (x, y) near (0,0)
If f has continuous ﬁrst-order partial derivatives, then
f(x, y) ≈L(x, y) = f(0, 0) + fx(0, 0)x + fy(0, 0)y.
We get a better approximation to f by using a quadratic polynomial. We choose a quadratic
polynomial Q(x, y), with the same partial derivatives as the original function f. You can check that
the following Taylor polynomial of degree 2 has this property.
Taylor Polynomial of Degree 2 Approximating f(x, y) for (x, y) near (0,0)
If f has continuous second-order partial derivatives, then
f(x, y) ≈Q(x, y)

Chapter Fourteen DIFFERENTIATING FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES
Example 4
Let f(x, y) = cos(2x + y) + 3 sin(x + y)
(a) Compute the linear and quadratic Taylor polynomials, L and Q, approximating f near (0, 0).
(b) Explain why the contour plots of L and Q for −1 ≤x ≤1, −1 ≤y ≤1 look the way they do.
Solution
(a) We have f(0, 0) = 1. The derivatives we need are as follows:
fx(x, y) = −2 sin(2x + y) + 3 cos(x + y)
so fx(0, 0) = 3,
fy(x, y) = −sin(2x + y) + 3 cos(x + y)
so
fy(0, 0) = 3,
fxx(x, y) = −4 cos(2x + y) −3 sin(x + y) so fxx(0, 0) = −4,
fxy(x, y) = −2 cos(2x + y) −3 sin(x + y) so
fxy(0, 0) = −2,
fyy(x, y) = −cos(2x + y) −3 sin(x + y)
so
fyy(0, 0) = −1.
Thus, the linear approximation, L(x, y), to f(x, y) at (0, 0) is given by
f(x, y) ≈L(x, y) = f(0, 0) + fx(0, 0)x + fy(0, 0)y = 1 + 3x + 3y.
The quadratic approximation, Q(x, y), to f(x, y) near (0, 0) is given by
f(x, y) ≈Q(x, y)
= f(0, 0) + fx(0, 0)x + fy(0, 0)y + fxx(0, 0)
2
x2 + fxy(0, 0)xy + fyy(0, 0)
2
y2
= 1 + 3x + 3y −2x2 −2xy −1

Notice that the linear terms in Q(x, y) are the same as the linear terms in L(x, y). The quadratic
terms in Q(x, y) can be thought of as “correction terms” to the linear approximation.

Figure 14.61: Quadratic approximation,
Q(x, y)
Notice that the contour plot of Q is more similar to the contour plot of f than is the contour
plot of L. Since L is linear, the contour plot of L consists of parallel, equally spaced lines.
An alternative, and much quicker, way to ﬁnd the Taylor polynomial in the previous example is
to use the single-variable approximations. For example, since
cos u = 1 −u2
2! + u4
4! + · · ·
and
sin v = v −v3
3! + · · · ,
we can substitute u = 2x + y and v = x + y and expand. We discard terms beyond the second
(since we want the quadratic polynomial), getting
cos(2x+y) = 1−(2x + y)2

Linear and Quadratic Approximations near (a, b)
The local linearization for a function f(x, y) at a point (a, b) is
Taylor Polynomial of Degree 1 Approximating f(x, y) for (x, y) near (a, b)
If f has continuous ﬁrst-order partial derivatives, then
f(x, y) ≈L(x, y) = f(a, b) + fx(a, b)(x −a) + fy(a, b)(y −b).
This suggests that a quadratic polynomial approximation Q(x, y) for f(x, y) near a point (a, b)
should be written in terms of (x −a) and (y −b) instead of x and y. If we require that Q(a, b) =
f(a, b) and that the ﬁrst- and second-order partial derivatives of Q and f at (a, b) be equal, then we
get the following polynomial:
Taylor Polynomial of Degree 2 Approximating f(x, y) for (x, y) near (a, b)
If f has continuous second-order partial derivatives, then
f(x, y) ≈Q(x, y)

50. The weekly production, Y , in factories that manufacture
a certain item is modeled as a function of the quantity
of capital, K, and quantity of labor, L, at the factory.
Data shows that hiring a few extra workers increases pro-
duction. Moreover, for two factories with the same num-
ber of workers, hiring a few extra workers increases pro-
duction more for the factory with more capital. (With
more equipment, additional labor can be used more ef-

51. Data suggests that human surface area, S, can reason-

55. You plan to buy a used car. You are debating between a 5-
year old car and a 10-year old car and thinking about the
price. Experts report that the original price matters more
when buying a 5-year old car than a 10-year old car. This
suggests that we model the average market price, P, in
dollars as a function of two variables: the original price,
C, in dollars, and the age of the car, A, in years.

56. The tastiness, T , of a soup depends on the volume, V ,
of the soup in the pot and the quantity, S, of salt in the
soup. If you have more soup, you need more salt to make
it taste good. Match the three stories (a)–(c) to the three
statements (I)–(III) about partial derivatives.
(a) I started adding salt to the soup in the pot. At ﬁrst the
taste improved, but eventually the soup became too
salty and continuing to add more salt made it worse.
(b) The soup was too salty, so I started adding unsalted
soup. This improved the taste at ﬁrst, but eventually
there was too much soup for the salt, and continuing
to add unsalted soup just made it worse.
(c) The soup was too salty, so adding more salt would
have made it taste worse. I added a quart of unsalted
soup instead. Now it is not salty enough, but I can
improve the taste by adding salt.

14.8
DIFFERENTIABILITY
In Section 14.3 we gave an informal introduction to the concept of differentiability. We called a
function f(x, y) differentiable at a point (a, b) if it is well approximated by a linear function near
(a, b). This section focuses on the precise meaning of the phrase “well approximated.” By looking
at examples, we shall see that local linearity requires the existence of partial derivatives, but they
do not tell the whole story. In particular, existence of partial derivatives at a point is not sufﬁcient to
guarantee local linearity at that point.
We begin by discussing the relation between continuity and differentiability. As an illustration,
take a sheet of paper, crumple it into a ball and smooth it out again. Wherever there is a crease it
would be difﬁcult to approximate the surface by a plane—these are points of nondifferentiability
of the function giving the height of the paper above the ﬂoor. Yet the sheet of paper models a
graph which is continuous—there are no breaks. As in the case of one-variable calculus, continuity
does not imply differentiability. But differentiability does require continuity: there cannot be linear
approximations to a surface at points where there are abrupt changes in height.
Differentiability for Functions of Two Variables
For a function of two variables, as for a function of one variable, we deﬁne differentiability at a
point in terms of the error and the distance from the point. If the point is (a, b) and a nearby point is
(a + h, b + k), the distance between them is
√
h2 + k2. (See Figure 14.65.)
A function f(x, y) is differentiable at the point (a, b) if there is a linear function L(x, y) =
f(a, b) + m(x −a) + n(y −b) such that if the error E(x, y) is deﬁned by
f(x, y) = L(x, y) + E(x, y),
and if h = x −a, k = y −b, then the relative error E(a + h, b + k)/
√
h2 + k2 satisﬁes
lim
h→0
k→0
E(a + h, b + k)
√
h2 + k2
= 0.
The function f is differentiable on a region R if it is differentiable at each point of R. The
function L(x, y) is called the local linearization of f(x, y) near (a, b).

Partial Derivatives and Differentiability
In the next example, we show that this deﬁnition of differentiability is consistent with our previous
notion — that is, that m = fx and n = fy and that the graph of L(x, y) is the tangent plane.
Example 1
Show that if f is a differentiable function with local linearization L(x, y) = f(a, b) + m(x −a) +
n(y −b), then m = fx(a, b) and n = fy(a, b).
Solution
Since f is differentiable, we know that the relative error in L(x, y) tends to 0 as we get close to
(a, b). Suppose h > 0 and k = 0. Then we know that
0 = lim
h→0
E(a + h, b + k)


−m = fx(a, b) −m.
A similar result holds if h < 0, so we have m = fx(a, b). The result n = fy(a, b) is found in a
similar manner.
The previous example shows that if a function is differentiable at a point, it has partial deriva-
tives there. Therefore, if any of the partial derivatives fail to exist, then the function cannot be
differentiable. This is what happens in the following example of a cone.
Example 2
Consider the function f(x, y) =

x2 + y2. Is f differentiable at the origin?
x
y
z
:
Figure 14.66: The function f(x, y) =

x2 + y2 is not locally linear at (0, 0): Zooming in around
(0, 0) does not make the graph look like a plane

14.8 DIFFERENTIABILITY
817
Solution
If we zoom in on the graph of the function f(x, y) =

x2 + y2 at the origin, as shown in Fig-
ure 14.66, the sharp point remains; the graph never ﬂattens out to look like a plane. Near its vertex,
the graph does not look as if is well approximated (in any reasonable sense) by any plane.
Judging from the graph of f, we would not expect f to be differentiable at (0, 0). Let us check
this by trying to compute the partial derivatives of f at (0, 0):
fx(0, 0) = lim
h→0
f(h, 0) −f(0, 0)
h
= lim
h→0
√
h2 + 0 −0
h
= lim
h→0
|h|
h .
Since |h|/h = ±1, depending on whether h approaches 0 from the left or right, this limit does
not exist and so neither does the partial derivative fx(0, 0). Thus, f cannot be differentiable at the
origin. If it were, both of the partial derivatives, fx(0, 0) and fy(0, 0), would exist.
Alternatively, we could show directly that there is no linear approximation near (0, 0) that
satisﬁes the small relative error criterion for differentiability. Any plane passing through the point
(0, 0, 0) has the form L(x, y) = mx + ny for some constants m and n. If E(x, y) = f(x, y) −
L(x, y), then
E(x, y) =

x2 + y2 −mx −ny.
Then for f to be differentiable at the origin, we would need to show that
lim
h→0
k→0
√
h2 + k2 −mh −nk
√
h2 + k2
= 0.
Taking k = 0 gives
lim
h→0
|h| −mh
|h|
= 1 −m lim
h→0
h
|h|.
This limit exists only if m = 0 for the same reason as before. But then the value of the limit is 1
and not 0 as required. Thus, we again conclude f is not differentiable.
In Example 2 the partial derivatives fx and fy did not exist at the origin and this was sufﬁcient
to establish nondifferentiability there. We might expect that if both partial derivatives do exist, then
f is differentiable. But the next example shows that this not necessarily true: the existence of both
partial derivatives at a point is not sufﬁcient to guarantee differentiability.
Example 3
Consider the function f(x, y) = x1/3y1/3. Show that the partial derivatives fx(0, 0) and fy(0, 0)
exist, but that f is not differentiable at (0, 0).
x
y
z
Figure 14.67: Graph of z = x1/3y1/3 for z ≥0

818
Chapter Fourteen DIFFERENTIATING FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES
Solution
See Figure 14.67 for the part of the graph of z = x1/3y1/3 when z ≥0. We have f(0, 0) = 0 and
we compute the partial derivatives using the deﬁnition:
fx(0, 0) = lim
h→0
f(h, 0) −f(0, 0)
h
= lim
h→0
0 −0
h
= 0,
and similarly
fy(0, 0) = 0.
So, if there did exist a linear approximation near the origin, it would have to be L(x, y) = 0. But
we can show that this choice of L(x, y) does not result in the small relative error that is required for
differentiability. In fact, since E(x, y) = f(x, y) −L(x, y) = f(x, y), we need to look at the limit
lim
h→0
k→0
h1/3k1/3
√
h2 + k2 .
If this limit exists, we get the same value no matter how h and k approach 0. Suppose we take
k = h > 0. Then the limit becomes
lim
h→0
h1/3h1/3
√
h2 + h2 = lim
h→0
h2/3
h
√
2 = lim
h→0

h1/3√
2.
But this limit does not exist, since small values for h will make the fraction arbitrarily large. So the
only possible candidate for a linear approximation at the origin does not have a sufﬁciently small
relative error. Thus, this function is not differentiable at the origin, even though the partial derivatives
fx(0, 0) and fy(0, 0) exist. Figure 14.67 conﬁrms that near the origin the graph of z = f(x, y) is
not well approximated by any plane.
In summary,
• If a function is differentiable at a point, then both partial derivatives exist there.
• Having both partial derivatives at a point does not guarantee that a function is differen-
tiable there.
Continuity and Differentiability
We know that differentiable functions of one variable are continuous. Similarly, it can be shown that
if a function of two variables is differentiable at a point, then the function is continuous there.
In Example 3 the function f was continuous at the point where it was not differentiable. Ex-
ample 4 shows that even if the partial derivatives of a function exist at a point, the function is not
necessarily continuous at that point if it is not differentiable there.
Example 4
Suppose that f is the function of two variables deﬁned by
f(x, y) =

xy
x2 + y2 ,
(x, y) ̸= (0, 0),
0,
(x, y) = (0, 0).
Problem 23 on page 709 showed that f(x, y) is not continuous at the origin. Show that the partial
derivatives fx(0, 0) and fy(0, 0) exist. Could f be differentiable at (0, 0)?

Solution
From the deﬁnition of the partial derivative we see that
fx(0, 0) = lim

f(h, 0) −f(0, 0)

h→0
 1

h2 + 02


h = 0,
and similarly
fy(0, 0) = 0.
So, the partial derivatives fx(0, 0) and fy(0, 0) exist. However, f cannot be differentiable at the
origin since it is not continuous there.
In summary,
• If a function is differentiable at a point, then it is continuous there.
• Having both partial derivatives at a point does not guarantee that a function is continuous
there.
How Do We Know If a Function Is Differentiable?
Can we use partial derivatives to tell us if a function is differentiable? As we see from Examples 3
and 4, it is not enough that the partial derivatives exist. However, the following theorem gives con-
ditions that do guarantee differentiability4:
Theorem 14.2: Continuity of Partial Derivatives Implies Differentiability
If the partial derivatives, fx and fy, of a function f exist and are continuous on a small disk
centered at the point (a, b), then f is differentiable at (a, b).
We will not prove this theorem, although it provides a criterion for differentiability which is
often simpler to use than the deﬁnition. It turns out that the requirement of continuous partial deriva-
tives is more stringent than that of differentiability, so there exist differentiable functions which do
not have continuous partial derivatives. However, most functions we encounter will have continuous
partial derivatives. The class of functions with continuous partial derivatives is given the name C1.
Example 5
Show that the function f(x, y) = ln(x2 + y2) is differentiable everywhere in its domain.
Solution
The domain of f is all of 2-space except for the origin. We shall show that f has continuous partial
derivatives everywhere in its domain (that is, the function f is in C1). The partial derivatives are
fx =
2x
x2 + y2
and
fy =
2y
x2 + y2 .
Since each of fx and fy is the quotient of continuous functions, the partial derivatives are con-
tinuous everywhere except the origin (where the denominators are zero). Thus, f is differentiable
everywhere in its domain.
Most functions built up from elementary functions have continuous partial derivatives, except
perhaps at a few obvious points. Thus, in practice, we can often identify functions as being C1
without explicitly computing the partial derivatives.

CRITICAL POINTS: LOCAL EXTREMA AND SADDLE POINTS
Functions of several variables, like functions of one variable, can have local and global extrema.
(That is, local and global maxima and minima.) A function has a local extremum at a point where
it takes on the largest or smallest value in a small region around the point. Global extrema are the
largest or smallest values anywhere on the domain under consideration. (See Figures 15.1 and 15.2.)

More precisely, considering only points at which f is deﬁned, we say:
• f has a local maximum at the point P0 if f(P0) ≥f(P) for all points P near P0.
• f has a local minimum at the point P0 if f(P0) ≤f(P) for all points P near P0.
How Do We Detect a Local Maximum or Minimum?
Recall that if the gradient vector of a function is deﬁned and nonzero, then it points in a direction in
which the function increases. Suppose that a function f has a local maximum at a point P0 which
is not on the boundary of the domain. If the vector gradf(P0) were deﬁned and nonzero, then we
could increase f by moving in the direction of grad f(P0). Since f has a local maximum at P0,
there is no direction in which f is increasing. Thus, if gradf(P0) is deﬁned, we must have
gradf(P0) = ⃗0 .
Similarly, suppose f has a local minimum at the point P0. If grad f(P0) were deﬁned and nonzero,
then we could decrease f by moving in the direction opposite to grad f(P0), and so we must again
have gradf(P0) = ⃗0 . Therefore, we make the following deﬁnition:
Points where the gradient is either ⃗0 or undeﬁned are called critical points of the function.
If a function has a local maximum or minimum at a point P0, not on the boundary of its do-
main, then P0 is a critical point. For a function of two variables, we can also see that the gradient
vector must be zero or undeﬁned at a local maximum by looking at its contour diagram and a plot of
its gradient vectors. (See Figures 15.3 and 15.4.) Around the maximum the vectors are all pointing
inward, perpendicularly to the contours. At the maximum the gradient vector must be zero or unde-
ﬁned. A similar argument shows that the gradient must be zero or undeﬁned at a local minimum.

Finding and Analyzing Critical Points
To ﬁnd critical points of f we set gradf = fx⃗i + fy⃗j + fz⃗k = ⃗0 , which means setting all the
partial derivatives of f equal to zero. We must also look for the points where one or more of the
partial derivatives is undeﬁned.
Example 1
Find and analyze the critical points of f(x, y) = x2 −2x + y2 −4y + 5.
Solution
To ﬁnd the critical points, we set both partial derivatives equal to zero:
fx(x, y) = 2x −2 = 0
fy(x, y) = 2y −4 = 0.
Solving these equations gives x = 1, y = 2. Hence, f has only one critical point, namely (1, 2). To
see the behavior of f near (1, 2), look at the values of the function in Table 15.1.

The table suggests that the function has a local minimum value of 0 at (1, 2). We can conﬁrm
this by completing the square:
f(x, y) = x2 −2x + y2 −4y + 5 = (x −1)2 + (y −2)2.
Figure 15.5 shows that the graph of f is a paraboloid with vertex at the point (1, 2, 0). It is the
same shape as the graph of z = x2 + y2 (see Figure 12.12 on page 675), except that the vertex has
been shifted to (1, 2). So the point (1, 2) is a local minimum of f (as well as a global minimum).

Example 2
Find and analyze any critical points of f(x, y) = −

Solution
We look for points where gradf = ⃗0 or is undeﬁned. The partial derivatives are given by

x2 + y2 ,
fy(x, y) = −
y

x2 + y2 .
These partial derivatives are never simultaneously zero, but they are undeﬁned at x = 0, y = 0.
Thus, (0, 0) is a critical point and a possible extreme point. The graph of f (see Figure 15.6) is a
cone, with vertex at (0, 0). So f has a local and global maximum at (0, 0).

Example 3
Find and analyze any critical points of g(x, y) = x2 −y2.
Solution
To ﬁnd the critical points, we look for points where both partial derivatives are zero:
gx(x, y) = 2x = 0
gy(x, y) = −2y = 0.
Solving gives x = 0, y = 0, so the origin is the only critical point.
Figure 15.7 shows that near the origin g takes on both positive and negative values. Since
g(0, 0) = 0, the origin is a critical point which is neither a local maximum nor a local minimum.
The graph of g looks like a saddle.
The previous examples show that critical points can occur at local maxima or minima, or at
points which are neither: The functions g and h in Figures 15.7 and 15.8 both have critical points
at the origin. Figure 15.9 shows level curves of g. They are hyperbolas showing both positive and
negative values of g near (0, 0). Contrast this with the level curves of h near the local minimum in
Figure 15.10.

Example 4
Find the local extrema of the function f(x, y) = 8y3 + 12x2 −24xy.
Solution
We begin by looking for critical points:
fx(x, y) = 24x −24y,
fy(x, y) = 24y2 −24x.
Setting these expressions equal to zero gives the system of equations
x = y,
x = y2,
which has two solutions, (0, 0) and (1, 1). Are these local maxima, local minima or neither? Fig-
ure 15.11 shows contours of f near the points. Notice that f(1, 1) = −4 and that there is no other
−4 contour. The contours near (1, 1) suggest that f has a local minimum at the point (1, 1).
We have f(0, 0) = 0 and the contours near (0, 0) show that f takes both positive and negative
values nearby. This suggests that (0, 0) is a critical point which is neither a local maximum nor a
local minimum.

Classifying Critical Points
We can see whether a critical point of a function, f, is a local maximum, local minimum, or neither
by looking at the contour diagram. There is also an analytic method for making this distinction.
Quadratic Functions of the Form f(x, y) = ax2 + bxy + cy2
Near most critical points, a function has the same behavior as its quadratic Taylor approximation
about that point. Thus, we start by investigating critical points of quadratic functions of the form
f(x, y) = ax2 + bxy + cy2, where a, b and c are constants.

Chapter Fifteen OPTIMIZATION: LOCAL AND GLOBAL EXTREMA
Example 5
Find and analyze the local extrema of the function f(x, y) = x2 + xy + y2.
Solution
To ﬁnd critical points, we set
fx(x, y) = 2x + y = 0,
fy(x, y) = x + 2y = 0.
The only critical point is (0, 0), and the value of the function there is f(0, 0) = 0. If f is always
positive or zero near (0, 0), then (0, 0) is a local minimum; if f is always negative or zero near
(0, 0), it is a local maximum; if f takes both positive and negative values, it is neither. The graph in
Figure 15.12 suggests that (0, 0) is a local minimum.
How can we be sure that (0, 0) is a local minimum? We complete the square. Writing
f(x, y) = x2 + xy + y2 =

x + 1
2y
2
+ 3
4y2,
shows that f(x, y) is a sum of two nonnegative terms, so it is always greater than or equal to zero.
Thus, the critical point is both a local and a global minimum.

The Shape of the Graph of f(x, y) = ax2 + bxy + cy2
In general, a function of the form f(x, y) = ax2 + bxy + cy2 has one critical point at (0, 0).
Assuming a ̸= 0, we complete the square and write
ax2 + bxy + cy2 = a

The shape of the graph of f depends on whether the coefﬁcient of y2 is positive, negative, or zero.
The sign of the discriminant, D = 4ac −b2, determines the sign of the coefﬁcient of y2.
• If D > 0, then the expression inside the square brackets is positive or zero, so the function has
a local maximum or a local minimum.
• If a > 0, the function has a local minimum, since the graph is a right-side-up paraboloid,
like z = x2 + y2. (See Figure 15.13.)
• If a < 0, the function has a local maximum, since the graph is an upside-down paraboloid,
like z = −x2 −y2. (See Figure 15.14.)
• If D < 0, then the function goes up in some directions and goes down in others, like z =
x2 −y2. We say the function has a saddle point. (See Figure 15.15.)
• If D = 0, then the quadratic function is a(x + by/2a)2, whose graph is a parabolic cylinder.
(See Figure 15.16.)

More generally, the graph of g(x, y) = a(x −x0)2 + b(x −x0)(y −y0) + c(y −y0)2 has the
same shape as the graph of f(x, y) = ax2 + bxy + cy2, except that the critical point is at (x0, y0)
rather than (0, 0).1
Classifying the Critical Points of a Function
Suppose that f is any function with grad f(0, 0) = ⃗0 . Its quadratic Taylor polynomial near (0, 0),
f(x, y) ≈f(0, 0) + fx(0, 0)x + fy(0, 0)y
+ 1
2fxx(0, 0)x2 + fxy(0, 0)xy + 1
2fyy(0, 0)y2,
can be simpliﬁed using fx(0, 0) = fy(0, 0) = 0, which gives
f(x, y) −f(0, 0) ≈1
2fxx(0, 0)x2 + fxy(0, 0)xy + 1
2fyy(0, 0)y2.
The discriminant of this quadratic polynomial is
D = 4ac −b2 = 4
1
2fxx(0, 0)
 1
2fyy(0, 0)

−(fxy(0, 0))2,
which simpliﬁes to
D = fxx(0, 0)fyy(0, 0) −(fxy(0, 0))2.
There is a similar formula for D if the critical point is at (x0, y0). An analogy with quadratic func-
tions suggests the following test for classifying a critical point of a function of two variables:
Second-Derivative Test for Functions of Two Variables
Suppose (x0, y0) is a point where gradf(x0, y0) = ⃗0 . Let
D = fxx(x0, y0)fyy(x0, y0) −(fxy(x0, y0))2.
• If D > 0 and fxx(x0, y0) > 0, then f has a local minimum at (x0, y0).
• If D > 0 and fxx(x0, y0) < 0, then f has a local maximum at (x0, y0).
• If D < 0, then f has a saddle point at (x0, y0).
• If D = 0, anything can happen: f can have a local maximum, or a local minimum, or a
saddle point, or none of these, at (x0, y0).
Example 6
Find the local maxima, minima, and saddle points of f(x, y) = 1
2x2 + 3y3 + 9y2 −3xy + 9y −9x.
Solution
Setting the partial derivatives of f to zero gives
fx(x, y) = x −3y −9 = 0,
fy(x, y) = 9y2 + 18y + 9 −3x = 0.
1We assumed that a ̸= 0. If a = 0 and c ̸= 0, the same argument works. If both a = 0 and c = 0, then f(x, y) = bxy,
which has a saddle point.

836
Chapter Fifteen OPTIMIZATION: LOCAL AND GLOBAL EXTREMA
Eliminating x gives 9y2+9y−18 = 0, with solutions y = −2 and y = 1. The corresponding values
of x are x = 3 and x = 12, so the critical points of f are (3, −2) and (12, 1). The discriminant is
D(x, y) = fxxfyy −f 2
xy = (1)(18y + 18) −(−3)2 = 18y + 9.
Since D(3, −2) = −36 + 9 < 0, we know that (3, −2) is a saddle point of f. Since D(12, 1) =
18 + 9 > 0 and fxx(12, 1) = 1 > 0, we know that (12, 1) is a local minimum of f.
The second-derivative test does not give any information if D = 0. However, as the following
example illustrates, we may still be able to classify the critical points.
Example 7
Classify the critical points of f(x, y) = x4 + y4, and g(x, y) = −x4 −y4, and h(x, y) = x4 −y4.
Solution
Each of these functions has a critical point at (0, 0). Since all the second partial derivatives are 0
there, each function has D = 0. Near the origin, the graphs of f, g and h look like the surfaces in
Figures 15.13–15.15, respectively, so f has a local minimum at (0, 0), and g has a local maximum
at (0, 0), and h is saddle-shaped at (0, 0).
We can get the same results algebraically. Since f(0, 0) = 0 and f(x, y) > 0 elsewhere, f has
a local minimum at the origin. Since g(0, 0) = 0 and g(x, y) < 0 elsewhere, g has a local maximum
at the origin. Lastly, h is saddle-shaped at the origin since h(0, 0) = 0 and, away from the origin,
h(x, y) > 0 on the x-axis and h(x, y) < 0 on the y-axis.

Suppose we want to ﬁnd the highest and the lowest points in Colorado. A contour map is shown
in Figure 15.19. The highest point is the top of a mountain peak (point A on the map, Mt. Elbert,
14,440 feet high). What about the lowest point? Colorado does not have large pits without drainage,
like Death Valley in California. A drop of rain falling at any point in Colorado will eventually ﬂow
out of the state. If there is no local minimum inside the state, where is the lowest point? It must be
on the state boundary at a point where a river is ﬂowing out of the state (point B where the Arikaree
River leaves the state, 3,315 feet high). The highest point in Colorado is a global maximum for the
elevation function in Colorado and the lowest point is the global minimum.

In general, if we are given a function f deﬁned on a region R, we say:
• f has a global maximum on R at the point P0 if f(P0) ≥f(P) for all points P in R.
• f has a global minimum on R at the point P0 if f(P0) ≤f(P) for all points P in R.
The process of ﬁnding a global maximum or minimum for a function f on a region R is called
optimization. If the region R is not stated explicitly, we take it to be the whole xy-plane unless the
context of the problem suggests otherwise.
How Do We Find Global Maxima and Minima?
As the Colorado example illustrates, a global extremum can occur either at a critical point inside
the region or at a point on the boundary of the region. This is analogous to single-variable calculus,
where a function achieves its global extrema on an interval either at a critical point inside the interval
or at an endpoint of the interval.
To locate global maxima and minima:
• Find the critical points.
• Investigate whether the critical points give global maxima or minima.

840
Chapter Fifteen OPTIMIZATION: LOCAL AND GLOBAL EXTREMA
Not all functions have a global maximum or minimum: it depends on the function and the
region. First, we consider applications in which global extrema are expected from practical con-
siderations. At the end of this section, we examine the conditions that lead to global extrema. In
general, the fact that a function has a single local maximum or minimum does not guarantee that
the point is the global maximum or minimum. (See Problem 26.) An exception is if the function is
quadratic, in which case the local maximum or minimum is the global maximum or minimum. (See
Example 1 on page 831 and Example 5 on page 834.)
Maximizing Profit and Minimizing Cost
In planning production of an item, a company often chooses the combination of price and quantity
that maximizes its proﬁt. We use
Proﬁt = Revenue −Cost,
and, provided the price is constant,
Revenue = Price · Quantity = pq.
In addition, we need to know how the cost and price depend on quantity.
Example 1
A company manufactures two items which are sold in two separate markets where it has a monopoly.
The quantities, q1 and q2, demanded by consumers, and the prices, p1 and p2 (in dollars), of each
item are related by
p1 = 600 −0.3q1
and
p2 = 500 −0.2q2.
Thus, if the price for either item increases, the demand for it decreases. The company’s total pro-
duction cost is given by
C = 16 + 1.2q1 + 1.5q2 + 0.2q1q2.
To maximize its total proﬁt, how much of each product should be produced? What is the maximum
proﬁt? 2
Solution
The total revenue, R, is the sum of the revenues, p1q1 and p2q2, from each market. Substituting for
p1 and p2, we get
R = p1q1 + p2q2 = (600 −0.3q1)q1 + (500 −0.2q2)q2
= 600q1 −0.3q2
1 + 500q2 −0.2q2
2.
Thus, the total proﬁt P is given by
P = R −C = 600q1 −0.3q2
1 + 500q2 −0.2q2
2 −(16 + 1.2q1 + 1.5q2 + 0.2q1q2)
= −16 + 598.8q1 −0.3q2
1 + 498.5q2 −0.2q2
2 −0.2q1q2.
Since q1 and q2 cannot be negative,3 the region we consider is the ﬁrst quadrant with boundary
q1 = 0 and q2 = 0.
To maximize P, we look for critical points by setting the partial derivatives equal to 0:
∂P
∂q1
= 598.8 −0.6q1 −0.2q2 = 0,
∂P
∂q2
= 498.5 −0.4q2 −0.2q1 = 0.
2Adapted from M. Rosser, Basic Mathematics for Economists, p. 316 (New York: Routledge, 1993).
3Restricting prices to be nonnegative further restricts the region but does not alter the solution.

15.2 OPTIMIZATION
841
Since grad P is deﬁned everywhere, the only critical points of P are those where grad P = ⃗0 .
Thus, solving for q1, and q2, we ﬁnd that
q1 = 699.1
and
q2 = 896.7.
The corresponding prices are
p1 = 390.27
and
p2 = 320.66.
To see whether or not we have found a local maximum, we compute second partial derivatives:
∂2P
∂q2

= −0.6,
∂2P

2
= −0.4,

= (−0.6)(−0.4) −(−0.2)2 = 0.2.
Therefore we have found a local maximum. The graph of P is an upside-down paraboloid, so
(699.1, 896.7) is a global maximum. This point is within the region, so points on the boundary give
smaller values of P.
The company should produce 699.1 units of the ﬁrst item priced at $390.27 per unit, and
896.7 units of the second item priced at $320.66 per unit. The maximum proﬁt P(699.1, 896.7) ≈
$433,000.
Example 2
A delivery of 480 cubic meters of gravel is to be made to a landﬁll. The trucker plans to purchase an
open-top box in which to transport the gravel in numerous trips. The total cost to the trucker is the
cost of the box plus $80 per trip. The box must have height 2 meters, but the trucker can choose the
length and width. The cost of the box is $100/m2 for the ends, $50/m2 for the sides and $200/m2
for the bottom. Notice the tradeoff: A smaller box is cheaper to buy but requires more trips. What
size box should the trucker buy to minimize the total cost? 4
Solution
We ﬁrst get an algebraic expression for the trucker’s cost. Let the length of the box be x meters and
the width be y meters; the height is 2 meters. (See Figure 15.20.)

derivatives. The trucker’s cost is itemized in Table 15.2. The problem is to minimize

Chapter Fifteen OPTIMIZATION: LOCAL AND GLOBAL EXTREMA
The length and width of the box must be positive. Thus, the region is the ﬁrst quadrant but it does
not contain the boundary, x = 0 and y = 0.
Our problem is to minimize
f(x, y) = 96
xy + 2y + x + xy.
The critical points of this function occur where
fx(x, y) = −96
x2y + 1 + y = 0
fy(x, y) = −96
xy2 + 2 + x = 0.
We put the 96/(x2y) and 96/(xy2) terms on the other side of the the equation, divide, and simplify:
96/(x2y)
96/(xy2) = 1 + y
2 + x
so
y
x = 1 + y
2 + x
giving
2y = x.
Substituting x = 2y in the equation fy(x, y) = 0 gives
−
96
2y · y2 + 2 + 2y = 0
y4 + y3 −24 = 0.
The only positive solution to this equation is y = 2, so the only critical point in the region is (4, 2).
To check that the critical point is a local minimum, we use the second-derivative test. Since
D(4, 2) = fxxfyy −(fxy)2 = 192

4 > 0
and fxx(4, 2) > 0, the point (4, 2) is a local minimum. Since the value of f increases without bound
as x or y increases without bound and as x →0+ and y →0+, it can be shown that (4, 2) is a global
minimum. (See Problem 29.) Thus, the optimal box is 4 meters long and 2 meters wide.
Fitting a Line to Data: Least Squares
Suppose we want to ﬁt the “best” line to some data in the plane. We measure the distance from a
line to the data points by adding the squares of the vertical distances from each point to the line.
The smaller this sum of squares is, the better the line ﬁts the data. The line with the minimum sum
of square distances is called the least squares line, or the regression line. If the data is nearly linear,
the least squares line is a good ﬁt; otherwise it may not be. (See Figure 15.21.)
Data almost linear: line fits well
Data not very linear: line does not fit well

Solution
Suppose the line has equation y = b + mx. If we ﬁnd b and m then we have found the line. So,
for this problem, b and m are the two variables. Any values of m and b are possible, so this is an
unconstrained problem. We want to minimize the function f(b, m) that gives the sum of the three
squared vertical distances from the points to the line in Figure 15.22.

Figure 15.22: The least squares line minimizes the sum of the squares of these vertical distances
The vertical distance from the point (1, 1) to the line is the difference in the y-coordinates
1 −(b + m); similarly for the other points. Thus, the sum of squares is
f(b, m) = (1 −(b + m))2 + (1 −(b + 2m))2 + (3 −(b + 3m))2.
To minimize f we look for critical points. First we differentiate f with respect to b:
∂f
∂b = −2(1 −(b + m)) −2(1 −(b + 2m)) −2(3 −(b + 3m))
= −2 + 2b + 2m −2 + 2b + 4m −6 + 2b + 6m
= −10 + 6b + 12m.
Now we differentiate with respect to m:
∂f
∂m = 2(1 −(b + m))(−1) + 2(1 −(b + 2m))(−2) + 2(3 −(b + 3m))(−3)
= −2 + 2b + 2m −4 + 4b + 8m −18 + 6b + 18m
= −24 + 12b + 28m.
The equations ∂f
∂b = 0 and ∂f
∂m = 0 give a system of two linear equations in two unknowns:
−10 + 6b + 12m = 0,
−24 + 12b + 28m = 0.
The solution to this pair of equations is the critical point b = −1/3 and m = 1. Since
D = fbbfmm −(fmb)2 = (6)(28) −122 = 24
and
fbb = 6 > 0,
we have found a local minimum. The graph of f(b, m) is a parabolic bowl, so the local minimum is
the global minimum of f. Thus, the least squares line is
y = x −1
3.
As a check, notice that the line y = x passes through the points (1, 1) and (3, 3). It is reasonable
that introducing the point (2, 1) moves the y-intercept down from 0 to −1/3.
The general formulas for the slope and y-intercept of a least squares line are in Project 2 on
page 865. Many calculators have built-in formulas for b and m, as well as for the correlation coefﬁ-
cient, which measures how well the data points ﬁt the least squares line.

How Do We Know Whether a Function Has a Global Maximum or Minimum?
Under what circumstances does a function of two variables have a global maximum or minimum?
The next example shows that a function may have both a global maximum and a global minimum
on a region, or just one, or neither.
Example 4
Investigate the global maxima and minima of the following functions:
(a) h(x, y) = 1 + x2 + y2 on the disk x2 + y2 ≤1.
(b) f(x, y) = x2 −2x + y2 −4y + 5 on the xy-plane.
(c) g(x, y) = x2 −y2 on the xy-plane.
Solution
(a) The graph of h(x, y) = 1 + x2 + y2 is a bowl-shaped paraboloid with a global minimum of 1
at (0, 0), and a global maximum of 2 on the edge of the region, x2 + y2 = 1.
(b) The graph of f in Figure 15.5 on page 831 shows that f has a global minimum at the point (1, 2)
and no global maximum (because the value of f increases without bound as x →∞, y →∞).
(c) The graph of g in Figure 15.7 on page 832 shows that g has no global maximum because
g(x, y) →∞as x →∞if y is constant. Similarly, g has no global minimum because g(x, y) →
−∞as y →∞if x is constant.
Sometimes a function is guaranteed to have a global maximum and minimum. For example, a
continuous function, h(x), of one variable has a global maximum and minimum on every closed
interval a ≤x ≤b. On a non-closed interval, such as a ≤x < b or a < x < b, or on an unbounded
interval, such as a < x < ∞, then h may not have a maximum or minimum value.
What is the situation for functions of two variables? As it turns out, a similar result is true for
continuous functions deﬁned on regions which are closed and bounded, analogous to the closed and
bounded interval a ≤x ≤b. In everyday language we say
• A closed region is one which contains its boundary;
• A bounded region is one which does not stretch to inﬁnity in any direction.
More precise deﬁnitions follow. Suppose R is a region in 2-space. A point (x0, y0) is a bound-
ary point of R if, for every r > 0, the disk (x −x0)2 + (y −y0)2 < r2 with center (x0, y0) and
radius r contains both points which are in R and points which are not in R. See Figure 15.23. A
point (x0, y0) can be a boundary point of the region R without belonging to R. A point (x0, y0)
in R is an interior point if it is not a boundary point; thus, for small enough r > 0, the disk of
radius r centered at (x0, y0) lies entirely in the region R. See Figure 15.24. The collection of all the
boundary points is the boundary of R and the collection of all the interior points is the interior of R.
The region R is closed if it contains its boundary; it is open if every point in R is an interior point.
A region R in 2-space is bounded if the distance between every point (x, y) in R and the origin
is less than some constant K. Closed and bounded regions in 3-space are deﬁned in the same way.

(a) The square −1 ≤x ≤1, −1 ≤y ≤1 is closed and bounded.
(b) The ﬁrst quadrant x ≥0, y ≥0 is closed but is not bounded.

15.2 OPTIMIZATION
845
(c) The disk x2 + y2 < 1 is open and bounded, but is not closed.
(d) The half-plane y > 0 is open, but is neither closed nor bounded.
The reason that closed and bounded regions are useful is the following theorem, which is also
true for functions of three or more variables:5
Theorem 15.1: Extreme Value Theorem for Multivariable Functions
If f is a continuous function on a closed and bounded region R, then f has a global maximum
at some point (x0, y0) in R and a global minimum at some point (x1, y1) in R.
If f is not continuous or the region R is not closed and bounded, there is no guarantee that f
achieves a global maximum or global minimum on R. In Example 4, the function g is continuous
but does not achieve a global maximum or minimum in 2-space, a region which is closed but not
bounded. Example 6 illustrates what can go wrong when the region is bounded but not closed.
Example 6
Does the function f have a global maximum or minimum on the region R given by 0 < x2 + y2 ≤1?
f(x, y) =
1
x2 + y2
Solution
The region R is bounded, but it is not closed since it does not contain the boundary point (0, 0).
We see from the graph of z = f(x, y) in Figure 15.25 that f has a global minimum on the circle
x2 + y2 = 1. However, f(x, y) →∞as (x, y) →(0, 0), so f has no global maximum.

CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION: LAGRANGE MULTIPLIERS
Many, perhaps most, real optimization problems are constrained by external circumstances. For
example, a city wanting to build a public transportation system has only a limited number of tax
dollars it can spend on the project. In this section, we see how to ﬁnd an optimum value under such
constraints.
In Section 15.2, we saw how to optimize a function f(x, y) on a region R. If the region R is
the entire xy-plane, we have unconstrained optimization; if the region R is not the entire xy-plane,
that is, if x or y is restricted in some way, then we have constrained optimization.
Graphical Approach: Maximizing Production Subject to a Budget Constraint
Suppose we want to maximize the production under a budget constraint. Suppose production, f, is
a function of two variables, x and y, which are quantities of two raw materials, and that
f(x, y) = x2/3y1/3.
If x and y are purchased at prices of p1 and p2 thousands of dollars per unit, what is the maximum
production f that can be obtained with a budget of c thousand dollars?
To maximize f without regard to the budget, we simply increase x and y. However, the budget
constraint prevents us from increasing x and y beyond a certain point. Exactly how does the budget
constrain us? With prices of p1 and p2, the amount spent on x is p1x and the amount spent on y is
p2y, so we must have
g(x, y) = p1x + p2y ≤c,
where g(x, y) is the total cost of the raw materials and c is the budget in thousands of dollars.
Let’s look at the case when p1 = p2 = 1 and c = 3.78. Then
x + y ≤3.78.
Figure 15.26 shows some contours of f and the budget constraint represented by the line x+y =
3.78. Any point on or below the line represents a pair of values of x and y that we can afford. A
point on the line completely exhausts the budget, while a point below the line represents values of x
and y which can be bought without using up the budget. Any point above the line represents a pair
of values that we cannot afford.
To maximize f, we ﬁnd the point which lies on the level curve with the largest possible value of
f and which lies within the budget. The point must lie on the budget constraint because we should
spend all the available money. Unless we are at the point where the budget constraint is tangent to
the contour f = 2, we can increase f by moving along the line representing the budget constraint in
Figure 15.26. For example, if we are on the line to the left of the point of tangency, moving right on
the constraint will increase f; if we are on the line to the right of the point of tangency, moving left
will increase f. Thus, the maximum value of f on the budget constraint occurs at the point where
the budget constraint is tangent to the contour f = 2.

Analytical Solution: Lagrange Multipliers
Figure 15.26 suggests that maximum production is achieved at the point where the budget constraint
is tangent to a level curve of the production function. The method of Lagrange multipliers uses this
fact in algebraic form. Figure 15.27 shows that at the optimum point, P, the gradient of f and the
normal to the budget line g(x, y) = 3.78 are parallel. Thus, at P, gradf and grad g are parallel, so
for some scalar λ, called the Lagrange multiplier,
grad f = λ grad g.
Since grad f =

 2
3x−1/3y1/3⃗i +

 1
3x2/3y−2/3⃗j and grad g = ⃗i + ⃗j , equating components
gives
2
3x−1/3y1/3 = λ
and
1
3x2/3y−2/3 = λ.
Eliminating λ gives
2
3x−1/3y1/3 = 1
3x2/3y−2/3,
which leads to
2y = x.
Since the constraint x + y = 3.78 must be satisﬁed, we have x = 2.52 and y = 1.26. Then
f(2.52, 1.26) = (2.52)2/3(1.26)1/3 ≈2.
As before, we see that the maximum value of f is approximately 2. Thus, to maximize production
on a budget of $3780, we should use 2.52 units of one raw material and 1.26 units of the other.

Chapter Fifteen OPTIMIZATION: LOCAL AND GLOBAL EXTREMA
Lagrange Multipliers in General
Suppose we want to optimize an objective function f(x, y) subject to a constraint g(x, y) = c. We
look for extrema among the points which satisfy the constraint. We make the following deﬁnition.
Suppose P0 is a point satisfying the constraint g(x, y) = c.
• f has a local maximum at P0 subject to the constraint if f(P0) ≥f(P) for all points
P near P0 satisfying the constraint.
• f has a global maximum at P0 subject to the constraint if f(P0) ≥f(P) for all points
P satisfying the constraint.
Local and global minima are deﬁned similarly.
As we saw in the production example, constrained extrema occur at points of tangency of
contours of f and g; they can also occur at endpoints of constraints. At a point of tangency, gradf
is perpendicular to the constraint and so parallel to grad g. At interior points on the constraint where
gradf is not perpendicular to the constraint, the value of f can be increased or decreased by moving
along the constraint. Therefore constrained extrema occur only at points where gradf and gradg
are parallel or at endpoints of the constraint. (See Figure 15.28.) At points where the gradients are
parallel, provided grad g ̸= ⃗0 , there is a constant λ such that gradf = λ gradg.
Optimizing f Subject to the Constraint g = c:
If a smooth function, f, has a maximum or minimum subject to a smooth constraint g = c at
a point P0, then either P0 satisﬁes the equations
gradf = λ grad g
and
g = c,
or P0 is an endpoint of the constraint, or grad g(P0) = ⃗0 . To ﬁnd P0, compare values of f at
the points satisfying these three conditions. The number λ is called the Lagrange multiplier.
If the set of points satisfying the constraint is closed and bounded, such as a circle or line
segment, then there must be a global maximum and minimum of f subject to the constraint. If the
constraint is not closed and bounded, such as a line or hyperbola, then there may or may not be a
global maximum and minimum.

15.3 CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION: LAGRANGE MULTIPLIERS
851
Solution
The objective function is
f(x, y) = x + y,
and the constraint is
g(x, y) = x2 + y2 = 4.
Since gradf = fx⃗i + fy⃗j = ⃗i + ⃗j and gradg = gx⃗i + gy⃗j = 2x⃗i + 2y⃗j , the condition
gradf = λ grad g gives
1 = 2λx
and
1 = 2λy,
so
x = y.
We also know that
x2 + y2 = 4,
giving x = y =

How to Distinguish Maxima from Minima
There is a second-derivative test8 for classifying the critical points of constrained optimization prob-
lems, but it is more complicated than the test in Section 15.1. However, a graph of the constraint
and some contours usually shows which points are maxima, which points are minima, and which
are neither.
Optimization with Inequality Constraints
The production problem that we looked at ﬁrst was to maximize production f(x, y) subject to a
budget constraint
g(x, y) = p1x + p2y ≤c.
Since the inputs are nonnegative, x ≥0 and y ≥0, we have three inequality constraints, which
restrict (x, y) to a region of the plane rather than to a curve in the plane. In principle, we should ﬁrst
check to see whether or not f(x, y) has any critical points in the interior:
p1x + p2y < c,
x > 0
y > 0.
However, in the case of a budget constraint, we can see that the maximum of f must occur when
the budget is exhausted, so we look for the maximum value of f on the boundary line:
p1x + p2y = c,
x ≥0
y ≥0.

Chapter Fifteen OPTIMIZATION: LOCAL AND GLOBAL EXTREMA
Strategy for Optimizing f(x, y) Subject to the Constraint g(x, y) ≤c
• Find all points in the region g(x, y) < c where grad f is zero or undeﬁned.
• Use Lagrange multipliers to ﬁnd the local extrema of f on the boundary g(x, y) = c.
• Evaluate f at the points found in the previous two steps and compare the values.
From Section 15.2 we know that if f is continuous on a closed and bounded region, R, then f
is guaranteed to attain its global maximum and minimum values on R.
Example 2
Find the maximum and minimum values of f(x, y) = (x −1)2 + (y −2)2 subject to the constraint
x2 + y2 ≤45.
Solution
First, we look for all critical points of f in the interior of the region. Setting
fx(x, y) = 2(x −1) = 0
fy(x, y) = 2(y −2) = 0.
we ﬁnd f has exactly one critical point at x = 1, y = 2. Since 12 + 22 < 45, that critical point is in
the interior of the region.
Next, we ﬁnd the local extrema of f on the boundary curve x2 + y2 = 45. To do this, we use
Lagrange multipliers with constraint g(x, y) = x2 + y2 = 45. Setting gradf = λ grad g, we get
2(x −1) = λ · 2x,
2(y −2) = λ · 2y.
We can’t have x = 0 since the ﬁrst equation would become −2 = 0. Similarly, y ̸= 0. So we can
solve each equation for λ by dividing by x and y. Setting the expressions for λ equal gives
x −1
x
= y −2
y
,
so
y = 2x.
Combining this with the constraint x2 + y2 = 45, we get
5x2 = 45
so
x = ±3.
Since y = 2x, we have possible local extrema at x = 3, y = 6 and x = −3, y = −6.
We conclude that the only candidates for the maximum and minimum values of f in the region
occur at (1, 2), (3, 6), and (−3, −6). Evaluating f at these three points, we ﬁnd
f(1, 2) = 0,
f(3, 6) = 20,
f(−3, −6) = 80.
Therefore, the minimum value of f is 0 at (1, 2) and the maximum value is 80 at (−3, −6).
The Meaning of λ
In the uses of Lagrange multipliers so far, we never found (or needed) the value of λ. However, λ
does have a practical interpretation. In the production example, we wanted to maximize
f(x, y) = x2/3y1/3
subject to the constraint
g(x, y) = x + y = 3.78.

15.3 CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION: LAGRANGE MULTIPLIERS
853
We solved the equations
2
3x−1/3y1/3 = λ,
1
3x2/3y−2/3 = λ,
x + y = 3.78,
to get x = 2.52, y = 1.26 and f(2.52, 1.26) ≈2. Continuing to ﬁnd λ gives us
λ ≈0.53.
Now we do another, apparently unrelated, calculation. Suppose our budget is increased slightly,
from 3.78 to 4.78, giving a new budget constraint of x+ y = 4.78. Then the corresponding solution
is at x = 3.19 and y = 1.59 and the new maximum value (instead of f = 2) is
f = (3.19)2/3(1.59)1/3 ≈2.53.
Notice that the amount by which f has increased is 0.53, the value of λ. Thus, in this example,
the value of λ represents the extra production achieved by increasing the budget by one—in other
words, the extra “bang” you get for an extra “buck” of budget. In fact, this is true in general:
• The value of λ is approximately the increase in the optimum value of f when the budget is
increased by 1 unit.
More precisely:
• The value of λ represents the rate of change of the optimum value of f as the budget increases.
An Expression for λ
To interpret λ, we look at how the optimum value of the objective function f changes as the value
c of the constraint function g is varied. In general, the optimum point (x0, y0) depends on the
constraint value c. So, provided x0 and y0 are differentiable functions of c, we can use the chain
rule to differentiate the optimum value f(x0(c), y0(c)) with respect to c:
df
dc = ∂f
∂x
dx0
dc + ∂f
∂y
dy0
dc .
At the optimum point (x0, y0), we have fx = λgx and fy = λgy, and therefore
df
dc = λ
 ∂g
∂x
dx0
dc + ∂g
∂y
dy0
dc

= λdg
dc .
But, as g(x0(c), y0(c)) = c, we see that dg/dc = 1, so df/dc = λ. Thus, we have the following
interpretation of the Lagrange multiplier λ:
The value of λ is the rate of change of the optimum value of f as c increases (where g(x, y) =
c). If the optimum value of f is written as f(x0(c), y0(c)), then
d
dcf(x0(c), y0(c)) = λ.
Example 3
The quantity of goods produced according to the function f(x, y) = x2/3y1/3 is maximized subject
to the budget constraint x + y ≤3.78. The budget is increased to allow for a small increase in
production. What is the price of the product if the sale of the additional goods covers the budget
increase?

854
Chapter Fifteen OPTIMIZATION: LOCAL AND GLOBAL EXTREMA
Solution
We know that λ = 0.53, which tells us that df/dc = 0.53. The constraint corresponds to a budget of
$3.78 thousand. Therefore increasing the budget by $1000 increases production by about 0.53 units.
In order to make the increase in budget proﬁtable, the extra goods produced must sell for more than
$1000. Thus, if p is the price of each unit of the good, then 0.53p is the revenue from the extra 0.53
units sold. Thus, we need 0.53p ≥1000 so p ≥1000/0.53 = $1890.
The Lagrangian Function
Constrained optimization problems are frequently solved using a Lagrangian function, L. For ex-
ample, to optimize f(x, y) subject to the constraint g(x, y) = c, we use the Lagrangian function
L(x, y, λ) = f(x, y) −λ(g(x, y) −c).
To see how the function L is used, compute the partial derivatives of L:
∂L
∂x = ∂f
∂x −λ∂g
∂x,
∂L
∂y = ∂f
∂y −λ∂g
∂y,
∂L
∂λ = −(g(x, y) −c).
Notice that if (x0, y0) is an extreme point of f(x, y) subject to the constraint g(x, y) = c and λ0 is
the corresponding Lagrange multiplier, then at the point (x0, y0, λ0) we have
∂L
∂x = 0
and
∂L
∂y = 0
and
∂L
∂λ = 0.
In other words, (x0, y0, λ0) is a critical point for the unconstrained Lagrangian function, L(x, y, λ).
Thus, the Lagrangian converts a constrained optimization problem to an unconstrained problem.
Example 4
A company has a production function with three inputs x, y, and z given by
f(x, y, z) = 50x2/5y1/5z1/5.
The total budget is $24,000 and the company can buy x, y, and z at $80, $12, and $10 per unit,
respectively. What combination of inputs will maximize production? 9
Solution
We need to maximize the objective function
f(x, y, z) = 50x2/5y1/5z1/5,
subject to the constraint
g(x, y, z) = 80x + 12y + 10z = 24,000.
The method for functions of two variables works for functions of three variables, so we construct
the Lagrangian function
L(x, y, z, λ) = 50x2/5y1/5z1/5 −λ(80x + 12y + 10z −24,000),
9Adapted from M. Rosser, Basic Mathematics for Economists, p. 363 (New York: Routledge, 1993).

15.3 CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION: LAGRANGE MULTIPLIERS

and solve the system of equations we get from gradL = ⃗0 :
∂L
∂x = 20x−3/5y1/5z1/5 −80λ = 0,
∂L
∂y = 10x2/5y−4/5z1/5 −12λ = 0,
∂L
∂z = 10x2/5y1/5z−4/5 −10λ = 0,
∂L
∂λ = −(80x + 12y + 10z −24,000) = 0.
Simplifying this system gives
λ = 1
4x−3/5y1/5z1/5,
λ = 5
6x2/5y−4/5z1/5,
λ = x2/5y1/5z−4/5,
80x + 12y + 10z = 24,000.
Eliminating z from the ﬁrst two equations gives x = 0.3y. Eliminating x from the second and third
equations gives z = 1.2y. Substituting for x and z into 80x + 12y + 10z = 24,000 gives
80(0.3y) + 12y + 10(1.2y) = 24,000,
so y = 500. Then x = 150 and z = 600, and f(150, 500, 600) = 4,622 units.
The graph of the constraint, 80x + 12y + 10z = 24,000, is a plane. Since the inputs x, y, z
must be nonnegative, the graph is a triangle in the ﬁrst octant, with edges on the coordinate planes.
On the boundary of the triangle, one (or more) of the variables x, y, z is zero, so the function f is
zero. Thus production is maximized within the budget using x = 150, y = 500, and z = 600.

37. A doctor wants to schedule visits for two patients who
have been operated on for tumors so as to minimize the
expected delay in detecting a new tumor. Visits for pa-
tients 1 and 2 are scheduled at intervals of x1 and x2
weeks, respectively. A total of m visits per week is avail-
able for both patients combined.
The recurrence rates for tumors for patients 1 and 2
are judged to be v1 and v2 tumors per week, respectively.
Thus, v1/(v1 + v2) and v2/(v1 + v2) are the probabil-
ities that patient 1 and patient 2, respectively, will have
the next tumor. It is known that the expected delay in
detecting a tumor for a patient checked every x weeks
is x/2. Hence, the expected detection delay for both pa-
tients combined is given by10
f(x1, x2) =
v1
v1 + v2 · x1

example, capital and labor). Its production function
g(x, y) gives the quantity of the product that can be pro-
duced with x units of the ﬁrst input and y units of the

three-variable function C(p, q, u) where p and q are the

44. A utility function U(x, y) for two items gives the util-
ity (beneﬁt) to a consumer of x units of item 1 and y

variable function V (p, q, I) where p and q are the unit
prices of the two items. For ﬁxed p, q, and I, the value
V (p, q, I) is the maximum of U(x, y) subject to the con-
straint px + qy = I.

in part (a). This curve is called the envelope of the
cross-sections.

three real numbers. The rules say that you must ﬁrst
choose a value λ, then your opponent is free to choose
any values for x and y. Your goal is to make the value of
L(x, y, λ) = 10−x2 −y2−2x−λ(2x+2y) as small as
you can, and your opponent’s goal is to make it as large
as possible. What value of λ should you choose (assum-
ing you have a brilliant opponent who never makes mis-

50. An irrigation canal has a trapezoidal cross-section of area
50 m2, as in Figure 15.42. The average ﬂow rate in the
canal is inversely proportional to the wetted perimeter, p,
of the canal, that is, to the perimeter of the trapezoid in
Figure 15.42, excluding the top. Thus, to maximize the
ﬂow rate we must minimize p. Find the depth d, base
width w, and angle θ that give the maximum ﬂow rate.13

1. Optimization in Manufacturing
A recycling company makes paper from a combination of two raw materials A and B where
A is wood pulp from a timber company and B is waste paper from a recycling depot. The
production function is Q = f(x, y) where Q is the quantity of paper the company can make
using x units of A and y units of B. The cost of acquiring these materials is given by the cost
function C = g(x, y) = px + qy, where p is the unit price of A and q is the unit price of B.
(a) If the company decides to reduce the amount of A that it buys, then it can use the money
saved to buy additional B. The economic rate of substitution, or ERS, of B for A tells
how much additional B can be bought for the cost of a unit of A. Show that the ERS is
gx/gy = p/q.
(b) If the company decides to reduce slightly the amount of A that it buys, then it must buy
additional B in order to maintain a constant level of production. The technical rate of
substitution, or TRS, of B for A tells how much additional B to buy per unit reduction
in A. Show that the TRS is fx/fy. [Hint: The TRS is the rate at which y increases with
respect to x as a point (x, y) slides in the direction of decreasing x along a ﬁxed contour
f(x, y) = Q of the production function.]
(c) Show that to maximize the quantity of paper produced with a ﬁxed budget the company
should use raw materials A and B in quantities such that ERS = TRS.
(d) Show that to minimize the cost of producing a ﬁxed quantity of paper the company should
use raw materials A and B in quantities such that ERS = TRS.

3. Hockey and Entropy
Thirty teams compete for the Stanley Cup in the National Hockey League (after expansion in
2000). At the beginning of the season an experienced fan estimates that the probability that
team i will win is some number pi, where 0 ≤pi ≤1 and
30
+
i=1
pi = 1.
Exactly one team will actually win, so the probabilities have to add to 1. If one of the teams,
say team i, is certain to win then pi is equal to 1 and all the other pj are zero. Another extreme
case occurs if all the teams are equally likely to win, so all the pi are equal to 1/30, and the
outcome of the hockey season is completely unpredictable. Thus, the uncertainty in the outcome
of the hockey season depends on the probabilities p1, . . . , p30. In this problem we measure this
uncertainty quantitatively using the following function:
S(p1, . . . , p30) = −
30
+
i=1
pi
ln pi
ln 2 .
Note that as pi ≤1, we have −ln pi ≥0 and hence S ≥0.
(a) Show that limp→0 p ln p = 0. (This means that S is a continuous function of the pi, where
0 ≤pi ≤1 and 1 ≤i ≤30, if we set p ln p|p=0 equal to zero. Since S is then a continuous
function on a closed and bounded region, it attains a maximum and a minimum value on
this region.)
(b) Find the maximum value of S(p1, . . . , p30) subject to the constraint p1+· · ·+p30 = 1. What
are the values of pi in this case? What does your answer mean in terms of the uncertainty
in the outcome of the hockey season?
(c) Find the minimum value of S(p1, . . . , p30), subject to the constraint p1 + · · · + p30 = 1.
What are the values of pi in this case? What does your answer mean in terms of the uncer-
tainty in the outcome of the hockey season?
[Note: The function S is an example of an entropy function; the concept of entropy is used in
information theory, statistical mechanics, and thermodynamics when measuring the uncertainty
in an experiment (the hockey season in this problem) or physical system.]

THE DEFINITE INTEGRAL OF A FUNCTION OF TWO VARIABLES
The deﬁnite integral of a continuous one-variable function, f, is a limit of Riemann sums:
, b
a
f(x) dx = lim
Δx→0
+
i
f(xi) Δx,
where xi is a point in the ith subdivision of the interval [a, b]. In this section we extend this deﬁnition
to functions of two variables. We start by considering how to estimate total population from a two-
variable population density.
Population Density of Foxes in England
The fox population in parts of England is important to public health ofﬁcials concerned about the
disease rabies, which is spread by animals. Biologists use a contour diagram to display the fox
population density, D; see Figure 16.1, where D is in foxes per square kilometer.1 The bold contour
is the coastline, which may be thought of as the D = 0 contour; clearly the density is zero outside
it. We can think of D as a function of position, D = f(x, y) where x and y are in kilometers from
the southwest corner of the map.

Figure 16.1: Population density of foxes in southwestern England
Example 1
Estimate the total fox population in the region represented by the map in Figure 16.1.
Solution
We subdivide the map into the rectangles shown in Figure 16.1 and estimate the population in each
rectangle. For simplicity, we use the population density at the northeast corner of each rectangle. For
example, in the bottom left rectangle, the density is 0 at the northeast corner, in the next rectangle to
the east (right), the density in the northeast corner is 1. Continuing in this way, we get the estimates
in Table 16.1. To estimate the population in a rectangle, we multiply the density by the area of the
rectangle, 30 · 25 = 750 km2. Adding the results, we obtain
Estimate of population = (0.2 + 0.7 + 1.2 + 1.2 + 0.1 + 1.6 + 0.5 + 1.4
+ 1.1 + 1.6 + 1.5 + 1.8 + 1.5 + 1.3 + 1.1 + 2.0
+ 1.4 + 1.0 + 1.0 + 0.6 + 1.2)750 = 18,000 foxes.
Taking the upper and lower bounds for the population density on each rectangle enables us to ﬁnd
upper and lower estimates for the population. Using the same rectangles, the upper estimate is
approximately 35,000 and the lower estimate is 4,000. There is a wide discrepancy between the
upper and lower estimates; we could make them closer by taking ﬁner subdivisions.

Definition of the Definite Integral
The sums used to approximate the fox population are Riemann sums. We now deﬁne the deﬁnite
integral for a function f of two variables on a rectangular region. Given a continuous function
f(x, y) deﬁned on a region a ≤x ≤b and c ≤y ≤d, we subdivide each of the intervals
a ≤x ≤b and c ≤y ≤d into n and m equal subintervals respectively, giving nm subrectangles.
(See Figure 16.2.)

Figure 16.2: Subdivision of a rectangle into nm subrectangles
The area of each subrectangle is ΔA = Δx Δy, where Δx = (b −a)/n is the width of each
subdivision on the x-axis, and Δy = (d −c)/m is the width of each subdivision on the y-axis. To
compute the Riemann sum, we multiply the area of each subrectangle by the value of the function at
a point in the rectangle and add the resulting numbers. Choosing the point which gives the maximum
value, Mij, of the function on each rectangle, we get the upper sum, *
i,j MijΔxΔy.
The lower sum, *
i,j LijΔxΔy, is obtained by taking the minimum value on each rectangle. If
(uij, vij) is any point in the ij-th subrectangle, any other Riemann sum satisﬁes
+
i,j
LijΔxΔy ≤
+
i,j
f(uij, vij) Δx Δy ≤

MijΔxΔy.
We deﬁne the deﬁnite integral by taking the limit as the numbers of subdivisions, n and m, tend to
inﬁnity. By comparing upper and lower sums, as we did for the fox population, it can be shown that
the limit exists when the function, f, is continuous. We get the same limit by letting Δx and Δy
tend to 0. Thus, we have the following deﬁnition:
Suppose the function f is continuous on R, the rectangle a ≤x ≤b, c ≤y ≤d. If (uij, vij)
is any point in the ij-th subrectangle, we deﬁne the deﬁnite integral of f over R
,
R
f dA =
lim
Δx,Δy→0
+
i,j
f(uij, vij)ΔxΔy.
Such an integral is called a double integral.

870
Chapter Sixteen INTEGRATING FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES
The case when R is not rectangular is considered on page 872. Sometimes we think of dA as
being the area of an inﬁnitesimal rectangle of length dx and height dy, so that dA = dx dy. Then
we use the notation2
,
R
f dA =
,
R
f(x, y) dx dy.
For this deﬁnition, we used a particular type of Riemann sum with equal-sized rectangular
subdivisions. In a general Riemann sum, the subdivisions do not all have to be the same size.
Interpretation of the Double Integral as Volume
Just as the deﬁnite integral of a positive one-variable function can be interpreted as an area, so the
double integral of a positive two-variable function can be interpreted as a volume. In the one-variable
case we visualize the Riemann sums as the total area of rectangles above the subdivisions. In the
two-variable case we get solid bars instead of rectangles. As the number of subdivisions grows, the
tops of the bars approximate the surface better, and the volume of the bars gets closer to the volume
under the graph of the function. (See Figure 16.3.)

Thus, we have the following result:
If x, y, z represent length and f is positive, then

Example 2
Let R be the rectangle 0 ≤x ≤1 and 0 ≤y ≤1. Use Riemann sums to make upper and lower
estimates of the volume of the region above R and under the graph of z = e−(x2+y2).
Solution
If R is the rectangle 0 ≤x ≤1, 0 ≤y ≤1, the volume we want is given by
Volume =
,
R
e−(x2+y2) dA.
We divide R into 16 subrectangles by dividing each edge into four parts. Figure 16.4 shows that
f(x, y) = e−(x2+y2) decreases as we move away from the origin. Thus, to get an upper sum we
evaluate f on each subrectangle at the corner nearest the origin. For example, in the rectangle
0 ≤x ≤0.25, 0 ≤y ≤0.25, we evaluate f at (0, 0). Using Table 16.2, we ﬁnd that

To get a lower sum, we evaluate f at the opposite corner of each rectangle because the surface
slopes down in both the x and y directions. This yields a lower sum of 0.44. Thus,

The true value of the double integral, 0.5577 . . ., is trapped between the lower and upper sums.
Notice that the lower sum increases and the upper sum decreases as the number of subdivisions
increases. However, even with 64 subdivisions, the lower and upper sums agree with the true value
of the integral only in the ﬁrst decimal place.
Interpretation of the Double Integral as Area
In the special case that f(x, y) = 1 for all points (x, y) in the region R, each term in the Riemann
sum is of the form 1 · ΔA = ΔA and the double integral gives the area of the region R:

Interpretation of the Double Integral as Average Value
As in the one-variable case, the deﬁnite integral can be used to compute the average value of a
function:

We can rewrite this as
Average value × Area of R =

If we interpret the integral as the volume under the graph of f, then we can think of the average
value of f as the height of the box with the same volume that is on the same base. (See Figure 16.5.)
Imagine that the volume under the graph is made out of wax. If the wax melted within the perimeter
of R, then it would end up box-shaped with height equal to the average value of f.

Integral over Regions that Are Not Rectangles
We deﬁned the deﬁnite integral
-
R f(x, y) dA, for a rectangular region R. Now we extend the
deﬁnition to regions of other shapes, including triangles, circles, and regions bounded by the graphs
of piecewise continuous functions.
To approximate the deﬁnite integral over a region, R, which is not rectangular, we use a grid
of rectangles approximating the region. We obtain this grid by enclosing R in a large rectangle and
subdividing that rectangle; we consider just the subrectangles which are inside R.
As before, we pick a point (uij, vij) in each subrectangle and form a Riemann sum
+
i,j
f(uij, vij)ΔxΔy.
This time, however, the sum is over only those subrectangles within R. For example, in the case of
the fox population we can use the rectangles which are entirely on land. As the subdivisions become
ﬁner, the grid approximates the region R more closely. For a function, f, which is continuous on R,
we deﬁne the deﬁnite integral as follows:
,
R
f dA =
lim
Δx,Δy→0
+
i,j
f(uij, vij)ΔxΔy
where the Riemann sum is taken over the subrectangles inside R.
You may wonder why we can leave out the rectangles which cover the edge of R—if we in-
cluded them, might we get a different value for the integral? The answer is that for any region that

16.1 THE DEFINITE INTEGRAL OF A FUNCTION OF TWO VARIABLES
873
we are likely to meet, the area of the subrectangles covering the edge tends to 0 as the grid becomes
ﬁner. Therefore, omitting these rectangles does not affect the limit.
Convergence of Upper and Lower Sums to Same Limit
We have said that if f is continuous on the rectangle R, then the difference between upper and lower
sums for f converges to 0 as Δx and Δy approach 0. In the following example, we show this in a
particular case. The ideas in this example can be used in a general proof.
Example 3
Let f(x, y) = x2y and let R be the rectangle 0 ≤x ≤1, 0 ≤y ≤1. Show that the difference
between upper and lower Riemann sums for f on R converges to 0, as Δx and Δy approach 0.
Solution
The difference between the sums is
+
MijΔxΔy −
+
Lij ΔxΔy =
+
(Mij −Lij) ΔxΔy,
where Mij and Lij are the maximum and minimum of f on the ij-th subrectangle. Since f increases
in both the x and y directions, Mij occurs at the corner of the subrectangle farthest from the origin
and Lij at the closest. Moreover, since the slopes in the x and y directions don’t decrease as x and
y increase, the difference Mij −Lij is largest in the subrectangle Rnm which is farthest from the
origin. Thus,
+
(Mij −Lij) ΔxΔy ≤(Mnm −Lnm)
+
ΔxΔy = (Mnm −Lnm)Area(R).
Thus, the difference converges to 0 as long as (Mnm −Lnm) does. The maximum Mnm of f on
the nm-th subrectangle occurs at (1, 1), the subrectangle’s top right corner, and the minimum Lnm
occurs at the opposite corner, (1 −1/n, 1 −1/m). Substituting into f(x, y) = x2y gives

In Section 16.1 we approximated double integrals using Riemann sums. In this section we see how
to compute double integrals exactly using one-variable integrals.
The Fox Population Again: Expressing a Double Integral as an Iterated Integral
To estimate the fox population, we computed a sum of the form
Total population ≈

where 1 ≤i ≤n and 1 ≤j ≤m and the values f(uij, vij) can be arranged as in Table 16.7.

Since the total population is represented by

double integrals in the following theorem:3
Theorem 16.1: Writing a Double Integral as an Iterated Integral
If R is the rectangle a ≤x ≤b, c ≤y ≤d and f is a continuous function on R, then the
integral of f over R exists and is equal to the iterated integral

To evaluate the iterated integral, ﬁrst perform the inside integral with respect to x, holding y
constant; then integrate the result with respect to y.
Example 1
A building is 8 meters wide and 16 meters long. It has a ﬂat roof that is 12 meters high at one corner,
and 10 meters high at each of the adjacent corners. What is the volume of the building?
Solution
If we put the high corner on the z-axis, the long side along the y-axis, and the short side along the
x-axis, as in Figure 16.11, then the roof is a plane with z-intercept 12, and x slope (−2)/8 = −1/4,
and y slope (−2)/16 = −1/8. Hence, the equation of the roof is
z = 12 −1
4x −1
8y.
The volume is given by the double integral
Volume =

R
(12 −1

where R is the rectangle 0 ≤x ≤8, 0 ≤y ≤16. Setting up an iterated integral, we get

The Order of Integration
In computing the fox population, we could have chosen to add columns (ﬁxed x) ﬁrst, instead of the
rows. This leads to an iterated integral where x is constant in the inner integral instead of y. Thus,

, b
a
, d
c
f(x, y) dy

dx
where R is the rectangle a ≤x ≤b and c ≤y ≤d.
For any function we are likely to meet, it does not matter in which order we integrate over a
rectangular region R; we get the same value for the double integral either way.

Iterated Integrals Over Non-Rectangular Regions

The density at the point (x, y) of a triangular metal plate, as shown in Figure 16.13, is δ(x, y).
Express its mass as an iterated integral.

Figure 16.13: A triangular metal plate with density δ(x, y) at the point (x, y)
Solution
Approximate the triangular region using a grid of small rectangles of sides Δx and Δy. The mass
of one rectangle is given by
Mass of rectangle ≈Density · Area ≈δ(x, y)ΔxΔy.
Summing over all rectangles gives a Riemann sum which approximates the double integral:
Mass =
,
R
δ(x, y) dA,
where R is the triangle. We want to compute this integral using an iterated integral.
Think about how the iterated integral over the rectangle a ≤x ≤b, c ≤y ≤d works:
, b

, d
c
f(x, y) dy dx.
The inside integral with respect to y is along vertical strips which begin at the horizontal line y = c
and end at the line y = d. There is one such strip for each x between x = a and x = b. (See
Figure 16.14.)

Figure 16.16: Integrating over a
triangle using horizontal strips
For the triangular region in Figure 16.13, the idea is the same. The only difference is that the
individual vertical strips no longer all go from y = c to y = d. The vertical strip that starts at the
point (x, 0) ends at the point (x, 2−2x), because the top edge of the triangle is the line y = 2 −2x.
See Figure 16.15. On this vertical strip, y goes from 0 to 2 −2x. Hence, the inside integral is
, 2−2x
0
δ(x, y) dy.
Finally, since there is a vertical strip for each x between 0 and 1, the outside integral goes from
x = 0 to x = 1. Thus, the iterated integral we want is
Mass =
, 1
0
, 2−2x
0
δ(x, y) dy dx.

16.2 ITERATED INTEGRALS
879
We could have chosen to integrate in the opposite order, keeping y ﬁxed in the inner integral
instead of x. The limits are formed by looking at horizontal strips instead of vertical ones, and
expressing the x-values at the end points in terms of y. To ﬁnd the right endpoint of the strip, we
use the equation of the top edge of the triangle in the form x = 1−1
2y. Thus, a horizontal strip goes
from x = 0 to x = 1 −1
2y. Since there is a strip for every y from 0 to 2, the iterated integral is
Mass =
, 2
0
, 1−1
2 y
0
δ(x, y) dx dy.
Limits on Iterated Integrals
• The limits on the outer integral must be constants.
• The limits on the inner integral can involve only the variable in the outer integral. For
example, if the inner integral is with respect to x, its limits can be functions of y.
Example 4
Find the mass M of a metal plate R bounded by y = x and y = x2, with density given by δ(x, y) =
1 + xy kg/meter2. (See Figure 16.17.)
y = x2

Solution
The mass is given by
M =

R
δ(x, y) dA.
We integrate along vertical strips ﬁrst; this means we do the y integral ﬁrst, which goes from the
bottom boundary y = x2 to the top boundary y = x. The left edge of the region is at x = 0 and the
right edge is at the intersection point of y = x and y = x2, which is (1, 1). Thus, the x-coordinate
of the vertical strips can vary from x = 0 to x = 1, and so the mass is given by
M =

Think of the ocean as everything below the x-axis in the xy-plane and think of the city as the upper

Figure 16.18: The city by the ocean showing a typical vertical strip and a typical horizontal strip
The distance from any point (x, y) in the city to the ocean is the vertical distance to the x-axis,
namely y. Thus, we want to compute
Average distance =

Area(R)
,
R
y dA,
where R is the region between the upper half of the circle x2 + y2 = 9 and the x-axis. The area of
R is π32/2 = 9π/2.
To compute the integral, let’s take the inner integral with respect to y. A vertical strip goes from
the x-axis, namely y = 0, to the semicircle. The upper limit must be expressed in terms of x, so we
solve x2 + y2 = 9 to get y =
√
9 −x2. Since there is a strip for every x from −3 to 3, the integral
is:

Therefore, the average distance is 18/(9π/2) = 4/π = 1.273 km.
What if we choose the inner integral with respect to x? Then we get the limits by looking at
horizontal strips, not vertical, and we solve x2 + y2 = 9 for x in terms of y. We get x = −

In the examples so far, a region was given and the problem was to determine the limits for an
iterated integral. Sometimes the limits are known and we want to determine the region.

Solution
The inner integral is with respect to y, so we imagine the region built of vertical strips. The bottom
of each strip is on the line y = x/3, and the top is on the horizontal line y = 2. Since the limits of
the outer integral are 0 and 6, the whole region is contained between the vertical lines x = 0 and
x = 6. Notice that the lines y = 2 and y = x/3 meet where x = 6. See Figure 16.19.

Reversing the Order of Integration
It is sometimes helpful to reverse the order of integration in an iterated integral. An integral which
is difﬁcult or impossible with the integration in one order can be quite straightforward in the other.
The next example is such a case.

Solution
Since

y3 + 1 has no elementary antiderivative, we cannot calculate the inner integral symboli-
cally. We try reversing the order of integration. From Figure 16.19, we see that horizontal strips go
from x = 0 to x = 3y and that there is a strip for every y from 0 to 2. Thus, when we change the
order of integration we get

Thus, reversing the order of integration made the integral in the previous problem much easier.

TRIPLE INTEGRALS
A continuous function of three variables can be integrated over a solid region W in 3-space in the
same way as a function of two variables is integrated over a ﬂat region in 2-space. Again, we start
with a Riemann sum. First we subdivide W into smaller regions, then we multiply the volume of
each region by a value of the function in that region, and then we add the results. For example, if W
is the box a ≤x ≤b, c ≤y ≤d, p ≤z ≤q, then we subdivide each side into n, m, and l pieces,
thereby chopping W into nml smaller boxes, as shown in Figure 16.23.

Figure 16.23: Subdividing a three-dimensional box
The volume of each smaller box is
ΔV = ΔxΔyΔz,
where Δx = (b −a)/n, and Δy = (d −c)/m, and Δz = (q −p)/l. Using this subdivision, we
pick a point (uijk, vijk, wijk) in the ijk-th small box and construct a Riemann sum
+
i,j,k
f(uijk, vijk, wijk) ΔV.
If f is continuous, as Δx, Δy, and Δz approach 0, this Riemann sum approaches the deﬁnite

Example 1
A cube C has sides of length 4 cm and is made of a material of variable density. If one corner is at
the origin and the adjacent corners are on the positive x, y, and z axes, then the density at the point
(x, y, z) is δ(x, y, z) = 1 + xyz gm/cm3. Find the mass of the cube.
Solution
Consider a small piece ΔV of the cube, small enough so that the density remains close to constant
over the piece. Then
Mass of small piece = Density · Volume ≈δ(x, y, z) ΔV.
To get the total mass, we add the masses of the small pieces and take the limit as ΔV →0. Thus,
the mass is the triple integral

Example 2
Express the volume of the building described in Example 1 on page 876 as a triple integral.
Solution
The building is given by 0 ≤x ≤8, 0 ≤y ≤16, and 0 ≤z ≤12 −x/4 −y/8. (See Figure 16.24.)
To ﬁnd its volume, divide it into small cubes of volume ΔV = Δx Δy Δz and add. First, make a
vertical stack of cubes above the point (x, y, 0). This stack goes from z = 0 to z = 12−x/4−y/8,
so
Volume of vertical stack ≈
+

ΔV =

Δx Δy Δz =

Next, line up these stacks parallel to the y-axis to form a slice from y = 0 to y = 16. So
Volume of slice ≈

Finally, line up the slices along the x-axis from x = 0 to x = 8 and add up their volumes, to get

Solution
We break the cone in Figure 16.25 into small cubes of volume ΔV = Δx Δy Δz, on which the
density is approximately constant, and approximate the mass of each cube by δ(x, y, z) Δx Δy Δz.
Stacking the cubes vertically above the point (x, y, 0), starting on the cone at height z =

x2 + y2
and going up to z = 3, tells us that the inner integral is
, 3
√
x2+y2 δ(x, y, z) dz =
, 3
√
x2+y2 z dz.
There is a stack for every point in the xy-plane in the shadow of the cone. The cone z =

x2 + y2
intersects the horizontal plane z = 3 in the circle x2 +y2 = 9, so there is a stack for all (x, y) in the
region x2 + y2 ≤9. Lining up the stacks parallel to the y-axis gives a slice from y = −
√
9 −x2 to
y =
√
9 −x2, for each ﬁxed value of x. Thus, the limits on the middle integral are
, √

Finally, there is a slice for each x between −3 and 3, so the integral we want is

Notice that setting up the limits on the two outer integrals was just like setting up the limits for
a double integral over the region x2 + y2 ≤9.
As the previous example illustrates, for a region W contained between two surfaces, the inner-
most limits correspond to these surfaces. The middle and outer limits ensure that we integrate over
the “shadow” of W in the xy-plane.
Limits on Triple Integrals
• The limits for the outer integral are constants.
• The limits for the middle integral can involve only one variable (that in the outer integral).
• The limits for the inner integral can involve two variables (those on the two outer integrals).

DOUBLE INTEGRALS IN POLAR COORDINATES
Integration in Polar Coordinates
We started this chapter by putting a rectangular grid on the fox population density map, to estimate
the total population using a Riemann sum. However, sometimes a polar grid is more appropriate.
Example 1
A biologist studying insect populations around a circular lake divides the area into the polar sectors
in Figure 16.31. The approximate population density in each sector is shown in millions per square
km. Estimate the total insect population around the lake.

Chapter Sixteen INTEGRATING FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES
Solution
To get the estimate, we multiply the population density in each sector by the area of that sector.
Unlike the rectangles in a rectangular grid, the sectors in this grid do not all have the same area. The
inner sectors have area
1
4(π32 −π22) = 5π
4 ≈3.93 km2,
and the outer sectors have area
1
4(π42 −π32) = 7π
4 ≈5.50 km2,
so we estimate
Population ≈(20)(3.93) + (17)(3.93) + (14)(3.93) + (17)(3.93) +
(13)(5.50) + (10)(5.50) + (8)(5.50) + (10)(5.50)
= 492.74 million insects.
What Is dA in Polar Coordinates?
The previous example used a polar grid rather than a rectangular grid. A rectangular grid is con-
structed from vertical and horizontal lines of the form x = k (a constant) and y = l (another
constant). In polar coordinates, r = k gives a circle of radius k centered at the origin and θ = l
gives a ray emanating from the origin (at angle l with the x-axis). A polar grid is built out of these
circles and rays. Suppose we want to integrate f(r, θ) over the region R in Figure 16.32.

Choosing (rij, θij) in the ij-th bent rectangle in Figure 16.32 gives a Riemann sum:
+

f(rij, θij) ΔA.
To calculate the area ΔA, look at Figure 16.33. If Δr and Δθ are small, the shaded region is
approximately a rectangle with sides r Δθ and Δr, so
Δ A ≈rΔθΔr.
Thus, the Riemann sum is approximately

f(rij, θij) rij Δθ Δr.

(c) The bottom boundary of this trapezoid is the line y = (x/2) −1 and the top is the line y = 3,

INTEGRALS IN CYLINDRICAL AND SPHERICAL COORDINATES
Some double integrals are easier to evaluate in polar, rather than Cartesian, coordinates. Similarly,
some triple integrals are easier in non-Cartesian coordinates.
Cylindrical Coordinates
The cylindrical coordinates of a point (x, y, z) in 3-space are obtained by representing the x and y
coordinates in polar coordinates and letting the z-coordinate be the z-coordinate of the Cartesian
coordinate system. (See Figure 16.37.)
Relation Between Cartesian and Cylindrical Coordinates
Each point in 3-space is represented using 0 ≤r < ∞, 0 ≤θ ≤2π, −∞< z < ∞.
x = r cos θ,
y = r sin θ,
z = z.
As with polar coordinates in the plane, note that x2 + y2 = r2.

Setting r = c (where c is constant) gives a cylinder around the z-axis whose radius is c. Setting
θ = c gives a half-plane perpendicular to the xy plane, with one edge along the z-axis, making an
angle c with the x-axis. Setting z = c gives a horizontal plane |c| units from the xy-plane. We call
these fundamental surfaces.
The regions that can most easily be described in cylindrical coordinates are those regions whose
boundaries are such fundamental surfaces. (For example, vertical cylinders, or wedge-shaped parts
of vertical cylinders.)
Example 1
Describe in cylindrical coordinates a wedge of cheese cut from a cylinder 4 cm high and 6 cm in
radius; this wedge subtends an angle of π/6 at the center. (See Figure 16.41.)

Integration in Cylindrical Coordinates
To integrate in polar coordinates, we had to express the area element dA in terms of polar coordi-
nates: dA = r dr dθ. To evaluate a triple integral
-
W f dV in cylindrical coordinates, we need to
express the volume element dV in cylindrical coordinates.
In Figure 16.42, consider the volume element ΔV bounded by fundamental surfaces. The area
of the base is ΔA ≈rΔrΔθ. Since the height is Δz, the volume element is given approximately
by ΔV ≈r Δr Δθ Δz.
When computing integrals in cylindrical coordinates, put dV = r dr dθ dz. Other orders of
integration are also possible.

Example 3
A water tank in the shape of a hemisphere has radius a; its base is its plane face. Find the volume,
V , of water in the tank as a function of h, the depth of the water.
Solution
In Cartesian coordinates, a sphere of radius a has the equation x2+y2+z2 = a2. (See Figure 16.43.)
In cylindrical coordinates, r2 = x2 + y2, so this becomes
r2 + z2 = a2.
Thus, if we want to describe the amount of water in the tank in cylindrical coordinates, we let r go
from 0 to

and

From Figure 16.44 we have z = ρ cos φ and r = ρ sin φ, giving the following relationship:

Each point in 3-space is represented using 0 ≤ρ < ∞, 0 ≤φ ≤π, and 0 ≤θ ≤2π.

Also, ρ2 = x2 + y2 + z2.
This system of coordinates is useful when there is spherical symmetry with respect to the ori-
gin, either in the region of integration or in the integrand. The fundamental surfaces in spherical
coordinates are ρ = k (a constant), which is a sphere of radius k centered at the origin, θ = k (a
constant), which is the half-plane with its edge along the z-axis, and φ = k (a constant), which is a
cone if k ̸= π/2 and the xy-plane if k = π/2. (See Figures 16.45–16.47.)

Integration in Spherical Coordinates
To use spherical coordinates in triple integrals we need to express the volume element, dV , in
spherical coordinates. From Figure 16.48, we see that the volume element can be approximated by
a box with curved edges. One edge has length Δρ. The edge parallel to the xy-plane is an arc of
a circle made from rotating the cylindrical radius r (= ρ sin φ) through an angle Δθ, and so has
length ρ sin φ Δθ. The remaining edge comes from rotating the radius ρ through an angle Δφ, and
so has length ρ Δφ. Therefore, ΔV ≈Δρ(ρ Δφ)(ρ sin φ Δθ) = ρ2 sin φ Δρ Δφ Δθ.

In spherical coordinates, a ball of radius a is described by the inequalities 0 ≤ρ ≤a, 0 ≤θ ≤2π,

Example 5
Find the magnitude of the gravitational force exerted by a solid hemisphere of radius a and constant
density δ on a unit mass located at the center of the base of the hemisphere.
Solution
Assume the base of the hemisphere rests on the xy-plane with center at the origin. (See Fig-
ure 16.49.) Newton’s law of gravitation says that the force between two masses m1 and m2 at a
distance r apart is F = Gm1m2/r2, where G is the gravitation constant.
In this example, symmetry shows that the net component of the force on the particle at the
origin due to the hemisphere is in the z direction only. Any force in the x or y direction from some
part of the hemisphere is canceled by the force from another part of the hemisphere directly opposite
the ﬁrst.
To compute the net z-component of the gravitational force, we imagine a small piece of the
hemisphere with volume ΔV , located at spherical coordinates (ρ, θ, φ). This piece has mass δΔV ,
and exerts a force of magnitude F on the unit mass at the origin. The z-component of this force

16.5 INTEGRALS IN CYLINDRICAL AND SPHERICAL COORDINATES

is given by its projection onto the z-axis, which can be seen from the ﬁgure to be F cos φ. The
distance from the mass δΔV to the unit mass at the origin is the spherical coordinate ρ. Therefore,
the z-component of the force due to the small piece ΔV is

APPLICATIONS OF INTEGRATION TO PROBABILITY
To represent how a quantity such as height or weight is distributed throughout a population, we use
a density function. To study two or more quantities at the same time and see how they are related,
we use a multivariable density function.
Density Functions
Distribution of Weight and Height in Expectant Mothers
Table 16.8 shows the distribution of weight and height in a survey of expectant mothers. The his-
togram in Figure 16.55 is constructed so that the volume of each bar represents the percentage in the
corresponding weight and height range. For example, the bar representing the mothers who weighed
60–70 kg and were 160–165 cm tall has base of area 10 kg · 5 cm = 50 kg cm. The volume of this
bar is 12%, so its height is 12%/50 kg cm = 0.24%/ kg cm. Notice that the units on the vertical
axis are % per kg cm, so the volume of a bar is a %. The total volume is 100% = 1.

16.6 APPLICATIONS OF INTEGRATION TO PROBABILITY
907
Example 1
Find the percentage of mothers in the survey with height between 170 and 180 cm.
Solution
We add the percentages across the row corresponding to the 170–180 cm height range; this is equiv-
alent to adding the volumes of the corresponding rectangular solids in the histogram.
Percentage of mothers = 0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 1 = 9%.
Smoothing the Histogram
If we group the data using narrower weight and height groups (and a larger sample), we can draw
a smoother histogram and get ﬁner estimates. In the limit, we replace the histogram with a smooth
surface, in such a way that the volume under the surface above a rectangle is the percentage of
mothers in that rectangle. We deﬁne a density function, p(w, h), to be the function whose graph is
the smooth surface. It has the property that
Fraction of sample with
weight between a and b and
height between c and d
=
Volume under graph of p
over the rectangle
a ≤w ≤b, c ≤h ≤d
=
, b
a
, d
c
p(w, h) dh dw.
This density also gives the probability that a mother is in these height and weight groups.
Joint Probability Density Functions
We generalize this idea to represent any two characteristics, x and y, distributed throughout a pop-
ulation.
A function p(x, y) is called a joint probability density function, or pdf, for x and y if
Probability that member of
population has x between a and b
and y between c and d
=

above the rectangle

p(x, y) dy dx
where
, ∞
−∞
, ∞
−∞
p(x, y) dy dx = 1
and
p(x, y) ≥0 for all x and y.
The probability that x falls in an interval of width Δx around x0 and y falls in an interval of
width Δy around y0 is approximately p(x0, y0)ΔxΔy.
A joint density function need not be continuous, as in Example 2. In addition, as in Example 4,
the integrals involved may be improper and must be computed by methods similar to those used for
improper one-variable integrals.
Example 2
Let p(x, y) be deﬁned on the square 0 ≤x ≤1, 0 ≤y ≤1 by p(x, y) = x + y; let p(x, y) = 0 if
(x, y) is outside this square. Check that p is a joint density function. In terms of the distribution of
x and y in the population, what does it mean that p(x, y) = 0 outside the square?

908
Chapter Sixteen INTEGRATING FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES
Solution
First, we have p(x, y) ≥0 for all x and y. To check that p is a joint density function, we show that
the total volume under the graph is 1:

The fact that p(x, y) = 0 outside the square means that the variables x and y never take values
outside the interval [0, 1]; that is, the value of x and y for any individual in the population is always
between 0 and 1.
Example 3
Two variables x and y are distributed in a population according to the density function of Example 2.
Find the fraction of the population with x ≤1/2, the fraction with y ≤1/2, and the fraction with
both x ≤1/2 and y ≤1/2.
Solution
The fraction with x ≤1/2 is the volume under the graph to the left of the line x = 1/2:

Example 4
Let p1 and p2 be one-variable density functions for x and y, respectively. Check that p(x, y) =
p1(x)p2(y) is a joint density function.
Solution
Since both p1 and p2 are density functions, they are nonnegative everywhere. Thus, their product
p1(x)p2(x) = p(x, y) is nonnegative everywhere. Now we must check that the volume under the

A machine in a factory is set to produce components 10 cm long and 5 cm in diameter. In fact,
there is a slight variation from one component to the next. A component is usable if its length and

In order to compute this proportion, the company deﬁnes

represents perfect health and x = 1 represents total dis-
ability. In addition, the company uses a density function,
f(x, y), deﬁned in such a way that the quantity
f(x, y) Δx Δy
approximates the fraction of the population with disabil-
ity index between x and x + Δx, and aged between y
and y + Δy. The company knows from experience that a

PARAMETERIZED CURVES
A curve in the plane may be parameterized by a pair of equations of the form x = f(t), y = g(t).
As the parameter t changes, the point (x, y) traces out the curve. In this section we ﬁnd paramet-
ric equations for curves in three dimensions, and we see how to write parametric equations using
position vectors.
Parametric Equations in Three Dimensions
We describe motion in the plane by giving parametric equations for x and y in terms of t. To describe
a motion in 3-space parametrically, we need a third equation giving z in terms of t.
Example 1
Find parametric equations for the curve y = x2 in the xy-plane.
Solution
A possible parameterization in two dimensions is x = t, y = t2. Since the curve is in the xy-plane,
the z-coordinate is zero, so a parameterization in three dimensions is
x = t,
y = t2,
z = 0.
Example 2
Find parametric equations for a particle that starts at (0, 3, 0) and moves around a circle as shown
in Figure 17.1.
x
y
z
I
Start
Figure 17.1: Circle of radius 3 in the yz-plane, centered at origin
Solution
Since the motion is in the yz-plane, we have x = 0 at all times t. Looking at the yz-plane from the
positive x-direction we see motion around a circle of radius 3 in the clockwise direction. Thus,
x = 0,
y = 3 cost,
z = −3 sin t.
Example 3
Describe in words the motion given parametrically by
x = cos t,
y = sin t,
z = t.
Solution
The particle’s x- and y-coordinates give circular motion in the xy-plane, while the z-coordinate
increases steadily. Thus, the particle traces out a rising spiral, like a coiled spring. (See Figure 17.2.)
This curve is called a helix.

17.1 PARAMETERIZED CURVES
919
Example 4
Find parametric equations for the line parallel to the vector 2⃗i + 3⃗j + 4⃗k and through the point
(1, 5, 7).
Solution
Let’s imagine a particle at the point (1, 5, 7) at time t = 0 and moving through a displacement of
2⃗i + 3⃗j + 4⃗k for each unit of time, t. When t = 0, x = 1 and x increases by 2 units for every unit
of time. Thus, at time t, the x-coordinate of the particle is given by
x = 1 + 2t.
Similarly, the y-coordinate starts at y = 5 and increases at a rate of 3 units for every unit of time.
The z-coordinate starts at y = 7 and increases by 4 units for every unit of time. Thus, the parametric
equations of the line are
x = 1 + 2t,
y = 5 + 3t,
z = 7 + 4t.
We can generalize the previous example as follows:
Parametric Equations of a Line through the point (x0, y0, z0) and parallel to the vector
a⃗i + b⃗j + c⃗k are
x = x0 + at,
y = y0 + bt,
z = z0 + ct.
Notice that the coordinates x, y, and z are linear functions of the parameter t.
Example 5
(a) Describe in words the curve given by the parametric equations x = 3 + t, y = 2t, z = 1 −t.
(b) Find parametric equations for the line through the points (1, 2, −1) and (3, 3, 4).
Solution
(a) The curve is a line through the point (3, 0, 1) and parallel to the vector⃗i + 2⃗j −⃗k.
(b) The line is parallel to the vector between the points P = (1, 2, −1) and Q = (3, 3, 4).
−−→
PQ = (3 −1)⃗i + (3 −2)⃗j + (4 −(−1))⃗k = 2⃗i +⃗j + 5⃗k .
Thus, using the point P, the parametric equations are
x = 1 + 2t,
y = 2 + t,
z = −1 + 5t.
Using the point Q gives the equations x = 3 + 2t, y = 3 + t, z = 4 + 5t, which represent the
same line.
Using Position Vectors to Write Parameterized Curves as Vector-Valued Functions
A point in the plane with coordinates (x, y) can be represented by the position vector ⃗r = x⃗i + y⃗j
in Figure 17.3. Similarly, in 3-space we write ⃗r = x⃗i + y⃗j + z⃗k . (See Figure 17.4.)

We can write the parametric equations x = f(t), y = g(t), z = h(t) as a single vector equation
⃗r (t) = f(t)⃗i + g(t)⃗j + h(t)⃗k
called a parameterization. As the parameter t varies, the point with position vector ⃗r (t) traces out
a curve in 3-space. For example, the circular motion in the plane
x = cos t, y = sin t
can be written as
⃗r = (cos t)⃗i + (sin t)⃗j
and the helix in 3-space
x = cos t, y = sin t, z = t
can be written as
⃗r = (cos t)⃗i + (sin t)⃗j + t⃗k .
See Figure 17.5.
Example 6
Use vectors to give a parameterization for the circle of radius 1
2 centered at the point (−1, 2).
Solution
The circle of radius 1 centered at the origin is parameterized by the vector-valued function
⃗r 1(t) = cos t⃗i + sin t⃗j ,
0 ≤t ≤2π.
The point (−1, 2) has position vector ⃗r 0 = −⃗i + 2⃗j . The position vector, ⃗r (t), of a point on the
circle of radius 1
2 centered at (−1, 2) is found by adding 1
2⃗r 1 to ⃗r 0. (See Figures 17.6 and 17.7.)
Thus,
⃗r (t) = ⃗r 0 + 1
2⃗r 1(t) = −⃗i + 2⃗j + 1

Parametric Equation of a Line
Consider a straight line in the direction of a vector ⃗v passing through the point (x0, y0, z0) with
position vector ⃗r 0. We start at ⃗r 0 and move up and down the line, adding different multiples of ⃗v
to ⃗r 0. (See Figure 17.8.)

Figure 17.8: The line ⃗r (t) = ⃗r 0 + t⃗v
In this way, every point on the line can be written as ⃗r 0 + t⃗v , which yields the following:
Parametric Equation of a Line in Vector Form
The line through the point with position vector ⃗r0 = x0⃗i + y0⃗j + z0⃗k in the direction of the
vector ⃗v = a⃗i + b⃗j + c⃗k has parametric equation
⃗r (t) = ⃗r 0 + t⃗v .
Example 7
(a) Find parametric equations for the line passing through the points (2, −1, 3) and (−1, 5, 4).
(b) Represent the line segment from (2, −1, 3) to (−1, 5, 4) parametrically.
Solution
(a) The line passes through (2, −1, 3) and is parallel to the displacement vector ⃗v = −3⃗i +6⃗j +⃗k
from (2, −1, 3) to (−1, 5, 4). Thus, the parametric equation is
⃗r (t) = 2⃗i −⃗j + 3⃗k + t(−3⃗i + 6⃗j + ⃗k ).
(b) In the parameterization in part (a), t = 0 corresponds to the point (2, −1, 3) and t = 1 corre-
sponds to the point (−1, 5, 4). So the parameterization of the segment is
⃗r (t) = 2⃗i −⃗j + 3⃗k + t(−3⃗i + 6⃗j + ⃗k ),
0 ≤t ≤1.
Intersection of Curves and Surfaces
Parametric equations for a curve enable us to ﬁnd where a curve intersects a surface.
Example 8
Find the points at which the line x = t, y = 2t, z = 1 + t pierces the sphere of radius 10 centered
at the origin.
Solution
The equation for the sphere of radius 10 and centered at the origin is
x2 + y2 + z2 = 100.
To ﬁnd the intersection points of the line and the sphere, substitute the parametric equations of the
line into the equation of the sphere, giving
t2 + 4t2 + (1 + t)2 = 100,
so
6t2 + 2t −99 = 0,
which has the two solutions at approximately t = −4.23 and t = 3.90. Using the parametric
equation for the line, (x, y, z) = (t, 2t, 1 + t), we see that the line cuts the sphere at the two points
(x, y, z) = (−4.23, 2(−4.23), 1 + (−4.23)) = (−4.23, −8.46, −3.23),

922
Chapter Seventeen PARAMETERIZATION AND VECTOR FIELDS
and
(x, y, z) = (3.90, 2(3.90), 1 + 3.90) = (3.90, 7.80, 4.90).
We can also use parametric equations to ﬁnd the intersection of two curves.
Example 9
Two particles move through space, with equations ⃗r 1(t) = t⃗i + (1 + 2t)⃗j + (3 −2t)⃗k and
⃗r 2(t) = (−2 −2t)⃗i + (1 −2t)⃗j + (1 + t)⃗k . Do the particles ever collide? Do their paths cross?
Solution
To see if the particles collide, we must ﬁnd out if they pass through the same point at the same time
t. So we must ﬁnd a solution to the vector equation ⃗r 1(t) = ⃗r 2(t), which is the same as ﬁnding a
common solution to the three scalar equations
t = −2 −2t,
1 + 2t = 1 −2t,
3 −2t = 1 + t.
Separately, the solutions are t = −2/3, t = 0, and t = 2/3, so there is no common solution, and the
particles don’t collide. To see if their paths cross, we ﬁnd out if they pass through the same point at
two possibly different times, t1 and t2. So we solve the equations
t1 = −2 −2t2,
1 + 2t1 = 1 −2t2,
3 −2t1 = 1 + t2.
We solve the ﬁrst two equations simultaneously and get t1 = 2, t2 = −2. Since these values also
satisfy the third equation, the paths cross. The position of the ﬁrst particle at time t = 2 is the same
as the position of the second particle at time t = −2, namely the point (2, 5, −1).
Example 10
Are the lines x = −1 + t, y = 1 + 2t, z = 5 −t and x = 2 + 2t, y = 4 + t, z = 3 + t parallel? Do
they intersect?
Solution
In vector form the lines are parameterized by
⃗r = −⃗i +⃗j + 5⃗k + t(⃗i + 2⃗j −⃗k )
⃗r = 2⃗i + 4⃗j + 3⃗k + t(2⃗i +⃗j + ⃗k )
Their direction vectors⃗i + 2⃗j −⃗k and 2⃗i +⃗j +⃗k are not multiples of each other, so the lines are
not parallel. To ﬁnd out if they intersect, we see if they pass through the same point at two possibly
different times, t1 and t2:
−1 + t1 = 2 + 2t2,
1 + 2t1 = 4 + t2,
5 −t1 = 3 + t2.
The ﬁrst two equations give t1 = 1, t2 = −1. Since these values do not satisfy the third equation,
the paths do not cross, and so the lines do not intersect.
The next example shows how to tell if two different parameterizations give the same line.
Example 11
Show that the following two lines are the same:
⃗r = −⃗i −⃗j + ⃗k + t(3⃗i + 6⃗j −3⃗k )
⃗r =⃗i + 3⃗j −⃗k + t(−⃗i −2⃗j + ⃗k )
Solution
The direction vectors of the two lines, 3⃗i + 6⃗j −3⃗k and −⃗i −2⃗j +⃗k , are multiples of each other,
so the lines are parallel. To see if they are the same, we pick a point on the ﬁrst line and see if it is on
the second line. For example, the point on the ﬁrst line with t = 0 has position vector −⃗i −⃗j + ⃗k .
Solving
⃗i + 3⃗j −⃗k + t(−⃗i −2⃗j + ⃗k ) = −⃗i −⃗j + ⃗k
we get t = 2, so the two lines have a point in common. Thus, they are the same line, parameterized
in two different ways.

MOTION, VELOCITY, AND ACCELERATION
In this section we see how to ﬁnd the vector quantities of velocity and acceleration from a parametric
equation for the motion of an object.
The Velocity Vector
The velocity of a moving particle can be represented by a vector with the following properties:
The velocity vector of a moving object is a vector ⃗v such that:
• The magnitude of ⃗v is the speed of the object.
• The direction of ⃗v is the direction of motion.
Thus, the speed of the object is ∥⃗v ∥and the velocity vector is tangent to the object’s path.
Example 1
A child is sitting on a Ferris wheel of diameter 10 meters, making one revolution every 2 minutes.
Find the speed of the child and draw velocity vectors at two different times.
Solution
The child moves at a constant speed around a circle of radius 5 meters, completing one revolution
every 2 minutes. One revolution around a circle of radius 5 is a distance of 10π, so the child’s
speed is 10π/2 = 5π ≈15.7 m/min. Hence, the magnitude of the velocity vector is 15.7 m/min.
The direction of motion is tangent to the circle, and hence perpendicular to the radius at that point.
Figure 17.11 shows the direction of the vector at two different times.

Figure 17.11: Velocity vectors of a child on a Ferris wheel (Note that vectors
would be in opposite direction if viewed from the other side)
Computing the Velocity
We ﬁnd the velocity, as in one-variable calculus, by taking a limit. If the position vector of the
particle is ⃗r (t) at time t, then the displacement vector between its positions at times t and t + Δt is
Δ⃗r = ⃗r (t + Δt) −⃗r (t). (See Figure 17.12.) Over this interval,
Average velocity = Δ⃗r
Δt .

928
Chapter Seventeen PARAMETERIZATION AND VECTOR FIELDS
In the limit as Δt goes to zero we have the instantaneous velocity at time t:
The velocity vector, ⃗v (t), of a moving object with position vector ⃗r (t) at time t is
⃗v (t) = lim
Δt→0
Δ⃗r
Δt = lim
Δt→0
⃗r (t + Δt) −⃗r (t)

,
whenever the limit exists. We use the notation ⃗v = d⃗r
dt = ⃗r ′(t).
Notice that the direction of the velocity vector ⃗r ′(t) in Figure 17.12 is approximated by the
direction of the vector Δ⃗r and that the approximation gets better as Δt →0.

curve and the velocity vector ⃗v = ⃗r ′(t)
The Components of the Velocity Vector
If we represent a curve parametrically by x = f(t), y = g(t), z = h(t), then we can write its
position vector as: ⃗r (t) = f(t)⃗i + g(t)⃗j + h(t)⃗k . Now we can compute the velocity vector:
⃗v (t) = lim
Δt→0
⃗r (t + Δt) −⃗r (t)
Δt
= lim
Δt→0
(f(t + Δt)⃗i + g(t + Δt)⃗j + h(t + Δt)⃗k ) −(f(t)⃗i + g(t)⃗j + h(t)⃗k )

Thus, we have the following result:
The components of the velocity vector of a particle moving in space with position vector
⃗r (t) = f(t)⃗i + g(t)⃗j + h(t)⃗k at time t are given by
⃗v (t) = f ′(t)⃗i + g′(t)⃗j + h′(t)⃗k = dx

Example 2
Find the components of the velocity vector for the child on the Ferris wheel in Example 1 using a
coordinate system which has its origin at the center of the Ferris wheel and which makes the rotation
counterclockwise.
Solution
The Ferris wheel has radius 5 meters and completes 1 revolution counterclockwise every 2 minutes.
The motion is parameterized by an equation of the form
⃗r (t) = 5 cos(ωt)⃗i + 5 sin(ωt)⃗j ,

17.2 MOTION, VELOCITY, AND ACCELERATION
929
where ω is chosen to make the period 2 minutes. Since the period of cos(ωt) and sin(ωt) is 2π/ω,
we must have
2π
ω = 2,
so
ω = π.
Thus, the motion is described by the equation
⃗r (t) = 5 cos(πt)⃗i + 5 sin(πt)⃗j ,
where t is in minutes. The velocity is given by
⃗v = dx
dt
⃗i + dy
dt
⃗j = −5π sin(πt)⃗i + 5π cos(πt)⃗j .
To check, we calculate the magnitude of ⃗v ,
∥⃗v ∥=
!
(−5π)2 sin2(πt) + (5π)2 cos2(πt) = 5π
!
sin2(πt) + cos2(πt) = 5π ≈15.7,
which agrees with the speed we calculated in Example 1. To see that the direction is correct, we
must show that the vector ⃗v at any time t is perpendicular to the position vector of the particle at
time t. To do this, we compute the dot product of ⃗v and ⃗r :
⃗v · ⃗r = (−5π sin(πt)⃗i + 5π cos(πt)⃗j ) · (5 cos(πt)⃗i + 5 sin(πt)⃗j )
= −25π sin(πt) cos(πt) + 25π cos(πt) sin(πt) = 0.
So the velocity vector, ⃗v , is perpendicular to ⃗r and hence tangent to the circle. (See Figure 17.13.)

Velocity Vectors and Tangent Lines
Since the velocity vector is tangent to the path of motion, it can be used to ﬁnd parametric equations
for the tangent line, if there is one.
Example 3
Find the tangent line at the point (1, 1, 2) to the curve deﬁned by the parametric equation
⃗r (t) = t2⃗i + t3⃗j + 2t⃗k .
Solution
At time t = 1 the particle is at the point (1, 1, 2) with position vector ⃗r 0 = ⃗i + ⃗j + 2⃗k . The
velocity vector at time t is ⃗r ′(t) = 2t⃗i + 3t2⃗j + 2⃗k , so at time t = 1 the velocity is ⃗v = ⃗r ′(1) =
2⃗i +3⃗j +2⃗k . The tangent line passes through (1, 1, 2) in the direction of ⃗v , so it has the parametric
equation
⃗r (t) = ⃗r 0 + t⃗v = (⃗i +⃗j + 2⃗k ) + t(2⃗i + 3⃗j + 2⃗k ).

Chapter Seventeen PARAMETERIZATION AND VECTOR FIELDS
The Acceleration Vector
Just as the velocity of a particle moving in 2-space or 3-space is a vector quantity, so is the rate of
change of the velocity of the particle, namely its acceleration. Figure 17.14 shows a particle at time
t with velocity vector ⃗v (t) and then a little later at time t+Δt. The vector Δ⃗v = ⃗v (t+Δt)−⃗v (t)
is the change in velocity and points approximately in the direction of the acceleration. So,
Average acceleration = Δ⃗v
Δt .
In the limit as Δt →0, we have the instantaneous acceleration at time t:
The acceleration vector of an object moving with velocity ⃗v (t) at time t is
⃗a (t) = lim
Δt→0
Δ⃗v
Δt = lim

if the limit exists. We use the notation ⃗a = d⃗v

dt2 = ⃗r ′′(t).

⃗v (t + Δt)
⃗v (t)
⃗v (t + Δt)
Δ⃗v = ⃗v (t + Δt) −⃗v (t)

Components of the Acceleration Vector
If we represent a curve in space parametrically by x = f(t), y = g(t), z = h(t), we can express the
acceleration in components. The velocity vector ⃗v (t) is given by
⃗v (t) = f ′(t)⃗i + g′(t)⃗j + h′(t)⃗k .
From the deﬁnition of the acceleration vector, we have
⃗a (t) = lim
Δt→0
⃗v (t + Δt) −⃗v (t)

dt .
Using the same method to compute d⃗v /dt as we used to compute d⃗r /dt on page 928, we obtain
The components of the acceleration vector, ⃗a (t), at time t of a particle moving in space
with position vector ⃗r (t) = f(t)⃗i + g(t)⃗j + h(t)⃗k at time t are given by
⃗a (t) = f ′′(t)⃗i + g′′(t)⃗j + h′′(t)⃗k = d2x
dt2⃗i + d2y
dt2 ⃗j + d2z
dt2 ⃗k .
Motion in a Circle and Along a Line
We now consider the velocity and acceleration vectors for two basic motions: uniform motion
around a circle, and motion along a straight line.
Example 4
Find the acceleration vector for the child on the Ferris wheel in Examples 1 and 2.
Solution
The child’s position vector is given by ⃗r (t) = 5 cos(πt)⃗i + 5 sin(πt)⃗j . In Example 2 we saw that
the velocity vector is
⃗v (t) = dx
dt
⃗i + dy
dt
⃗j = −5π sin(πt)⃗i + 5π cos(πt)⃗j .

17.2 MOTION, VELOCITY, AND ACCELERATION
931
Thus, the acceleration vector is
⃗a (t) = d2x
dt2⃗i + d2y
dt2 ⃗j = −(5π) · π cos(πt)⃗i −(5π) · π sin(πt)⃗j
= −5π2 cos(πt)⃗i −5π2 sin(πt)⃗j .
Notice that ⃗a (t) = −π2⃗r (t). Thus, the acceleration vector is a multiple of ⃗r (t) and points toward
the origin.
The motion of the child on the Ferris wheel is an example of uniform circular motion, whose
properties follow. (See Problem 44.)
Uniform Circular Motion: For a particle whose motion is described by
⃗r (t) = R cos(ωt)⃗i + R sin(ωt)⃗j
• Motion is in a circle of radius R with period 2π/|ω|.
• Velocity, ⃗v , is tangent to the circle and speed is constant ∥⃗v ∥= |ω|R.
• Acceleration, ⃗a , points toward the center of the circle with ∥⃗a ∥= ∥⃗v ∥2/R.
In uniform circular motion, the acceleration vector is perpendicular to the velocity vector, ⃗v ,
because ⃗v does not change in magnitude, only in direction. There is no acceleration in the direction
of ⃗v .
We now look at straight-line motion in which the velocity vector always has the same direc-
tion but its magnitude changes. In straight-line motion, the acceleration vector points in the same
direction as the velocity vector if the speed is increasing and in the opposite direction to the velocity
vector if the speed is decreasing.
Example 5
Consider the motion given by the vector equation
⃗r (t) = 2⃗i + 6⃗j + (t3 + t)(4⃗i + 3⃗j + ⃗k ).
Show that this is straight-line motion in the direction of the vector 4⃗i + 3⃗j + ⃗k and relate the
acceleration vector to the velocity vector.
Solution
The velocity vector is
⃗v = (3t2 + 1)(4⃗i + 3⃗j + ⃗k ).
Since (3t2 + 1) is a positive scalar, the velocity vector ⃗v always points in the direction of the vector
4⃗i + 3⃗j + ⃗k . In addition,
Speed = ∥⃗v ∥= (3t2 + 1)

42 + 32 + 12 =
√
26(3t2 + 1).
Notice that the speed is decreasing until t = 0, then starts increasing. The acceleration vector is
⃗a = 6t(4⃗i + 3⃗j + ⃗k ).
For t > 0, the acceleration vector points in the same direction as 4⃗i + 3⃗j + ⃗k , which is the same
direction as ⃗v . This makes sense because the object is speeding up. For t < 0, the acceleration
vector 6t(4⃗i + 3⃗j + ⃗k ) points in the opposite direction to ⃗v because the object is slowing down.

Chapter Seventeen PARAMETERIZATION AND VECTOR FIELDS
Motion in a Straight Line: For a particle whose motion is described by
⃗r (t) = ⃗r 0 + f(t)⃗v
• Motion is along a straight line through the point with position vector ⃗r 0 parallel to ⃗v .
• Velocity, ⃗v , and acceleration, ⃗a , are parallel to the line.
If f(t) = t, then we have ⃗r (t) = ⃗r 0 + tv, the equation of a line obtained on page 921.

As in one dimension, we can ﬁnd the distance traveled by a particle along a curve by integrating its
speed. Thus,
Distance traveled =

∥⃗v (t)∥dt.
If the particle never stops or reverses its direction as it moves along the curve, the distance it travels
will be the same as the length of the curve. This suggests the following formula, which is justiﬁed
in Problem 53:
If the curve C is given parametrically for a ≤t ≤b by smooth functions and if the velocity
vector ⃗v is not ⃗0 for a < t < b, then
Length of C =

∥⃗v ∥dt.

Since the ellipse is inscribed in a circle of radius 2 and circumscribes a circle of radius 1, we
would expect the length of the ellipse to be between 2π(2) ≈12.57 and 2π(1) ≈6.28, so the value
of 9.69 is reasonable.

Introduction to Vector Fields
A vector ﬁeld is a function that assigns a vector to each point in the plane or in 3-space. One example
of a vector ﬁeld is the gradient of a function f(x, y); at each point (x, y) the vector grad f(x, y)
points in the direction of maximum rate of increase of f. In this section we look at other vector
ﬁelds representing velocities and forces.
Velocity Vector Fields
Figure 17.18 shows the ﬂow of a part of the Gulf Stream, a current in the Atlantic Ocean.2 It is
an example of a velocity vector ﬁeld: each vector shows the velocity of the current at that point.
The current is fastest where the velocity vectors are longest in the middle of the stream. Beside the
stream are eddies where the water ﬂows round and round in circles.
Force Fields
Another physical quantity represented by a vector is force. When we experience a force, sometimes
it results from direct contact with the object that supplies the force (for example, a push). Many
forces, however, can be felt at all points in space. For example, the earth exerts a gravitational pull
on all other masses. Such forces can be represented by vector ﬁelds.
Figure 17.19 shows the gravitational force exerted by the earth on a mass of one kilogram at
different points in space. This is a sketch of the vector ﬁeld in 3-space. You can see that the vectors
all point toward the earth (which is not shown in the diagram) and that the vectors farther from the
earth are smaller in magnitude.

Definition of a Vector Field
Now that you have seen some examples of vector ﬁelds, we give a more formal deﬁnition.
A vector ﬁeld in 2-space is a function ⃗F (x, y) whose value at a point (x, y) is a 2-
dimensional vector. Similarly, a vector ﬁeld in 3-space is a function ⃗F (x, y, z) whose values
are 3-dimensional vectors.
Notice the arrow over the function, ⃗F , indicating that its value is a vector, not a scalar. We often
represent the point (x, y) or (x, y, z) by its position vector ⃗r and write the vector ﬁeld as ⃗F (⃗r ).
Visualizing a Vector Field Given by a Formula
Since a vector ﬁeld is a function that assigns a vector to each point, a vector ﬁeld can often be given
by a formula.
Example 1
Sketch the vector ﬁeld in 2-space given by ⃗F (x, y) = −y⃗i + x⃗j .
Solution
Table 17.1 shows the value of the vector ﬁeld at a few points. Notice that each value is a vector. To
plot the vector ﬁeld, we plot ⃗F (x, y) with its tail at (x, y). (See Figure 17.20.)

−⃗i +⃗j
Now we look at the formula. The magnitude of the vector at (x, y) is the distance from (x, y)
to the origin since
∥⃗F (x, y)∥= ∥−y⃗i + x⃗j ∥=

x2 + y2.
Therefore, all the vectors at a ﬁxed distance from the origin (that is, on a circle centered at the
origin) have the same magnitude. The magnitude gets larger as we move farther from the origin.
What about the direction? Figure 17.20 suggests that at each point (x, y) the vector ⃗F (x, y) is
perpendicular to the position vector ⃗r = x⃗i + y⃗j . We conﬁrm this using the dot product:
⃗r · ⃗F (x, y) = (x⃗i + y⃗j ) · (−y⃗i + x⃗j ) = 0.
Thus, the vectors are tangent to circles centered at the origin and get longer as we go out. In Fig-
ure 17.21, the vectors have been scaled so that they do not obscure each other.

Example 2
Sketch the vector ﬁelds in 2-space given by (a)
⃗F (x, y) = x⃗j
(b)
⃗G (x, y) = x⃗i .
Solution
(a) The vector x⃗j is parallel to the y-direction, pointing up when x is positive and down when x is
negative. Also, the larger |x| is, the longer the vector. The vectors in the ﬁeld are constant along
vertical lines since the vector ﬁeld does not depend on y. (See Figure 17.22.)

(b) This is similar to the previous example, except that the vector x⃗i is parallel to the x-direction,
pointing to the right when x is positive and to the left when x is negative. Again, the larger |x|
is the longer the vector, and the vectors are constant along vertical lines, since the vector ﬁeld
does not depend on y. (See Figure 17.23.)
Example 3
Describe the vector ﬁeld in 3-space given by ⃗F (⃗r ) = ⃗r , where ⃗r = x⃗i + y⃗j + z⃗k .
Solution
The notation ⃗F (⃗r ) = ⃗r means that the value of ⃗F at the point (x, y, z) with position vector ⃗r is
the vector ⃗r with its tail at (x, y, z). Thus, the vector ﬁeld points outward. See Figure 17.24. Note
that the lengths of the vectors have been scaled down so as to ﬁt into the diagram.

Chapter Seventeen PARAMETERIZATION AND VECTOR FIELDS
Finding a Formula for a Vector Field
Example 4
Newton’s Law of Gravitation states that the magnitude of the gravitational force exerted by an object
of mass M on an object of mass m is proportional to M and m and inversely proportional to the
square of the distance between them. The direction of the force is from m to M along the line
connecting them. (See Figure 17.25.) Find a formula for the vector ﬁeld ⃗F (⃗r ) that represents the
gravitational force, assuming M is located at the origin and m is located at the point with position
vector ⃗r .
Solution
Since the mass m is located at ⃗r , Newton’s law says that the magnitude of the force is given by
∥⃗F (⃗r )∥= GMm
∥⃗r ∥2 ,
where G is the universal gravitational constant. A unit vector in the direction of the force is −⃗r /∥⃗r ∥,
where the negative sign indicates that the direction of force is toward the origin (gravity is attractive).
By taking the product of the magnitude of the force and a unit vector in the direction of the force,
we obtain an expression for the force vector ﬁeld:
⃗F (⃗r ) = GMm

We have already seen a picture of this vector ﬁeld in Figure 17.19.
Gradient Vector Fields
The gradient of a scalar function f is a function that assigns a vector to each point, and is therefore
a vector ﬁeld. It is called the gradient ﬁeld of f. Many vector ﬁelds in physics are gradient ﬁelds.

Figure 17.28: The contour map
of h(x, y) = x + 2y + 3
Solution
See Figures 17.29–17.31. For a function f(x, y), the gradient vector of f at a point is perpendicular
to the contours in the direction of increasing f and its magnitude is the rate of change in that
direction. The rate of change is large when the contours are close together and small when they are
far apart. Notice that in Figure 17.29 the vectors all point outward, away from the local minimum of
f, and in Figure 17.30 the vectors of gradg all point inward, toward the local maximum of g. Since
h is a linear function, its gradient is constant, so gradh in Figure 17.31 is a constant vector ﬁeld.

THE FLOW OF A VECTOR FIELD
When an iceberg is spotted in the North Atlantic, it is important to be able to predict where the
iceberg is likely to be a day or a week later. To do this, one needs to know the velocity vector ﬁeld
of the ocean currents, that is, how fast and in what direction the water is moving at each point.
In this section we use differential equations to ﬁnd the path of an object in a ﬂuid ﬂow. This
path is called a ﬂow line. Figure 17.35 shows several ﬂow lines for the Gulf Stream velocity vector
ﬁeld in Figure 17.18 on page 937. The arrows on each ﬂow line indicate the direction of ﬂow.

How Do We Find a Flow Line?
Suppose that ⃗F is the velocity vector ﬁeld of water on the surface of a creek and imagine a seed
being carried along by the current. We want to know the position vector ⃗r (t) of the seed at time t.
We know
Velocity of seed
at time t
=
Velocity of current at seed’s position
at time t
that is,
⃗r ′(t) = ⃗F (⃗r (t)).
We make the following deﬁnition:
A ﬂow line of a vector ﬁeld ⃗v = ⃗F (⃗r ) is a path ⃗r (t) whose velocity vector equals ⃗v . Thus,
⃗r ′(t) = ⃗v = ⃗F (⃗r (t)).
The ﬂow of a vector ﬁeld is the family of all of its ﬂow lines.
A ﬂow line is also called an integral curve or a streamline. We deﬁne ﬂow lines for any vector
ﬁeld, as it turns out to be useful to study the ﬂow of ﬁelds (for example, electric and magnetic) that
are not velocity ﬁelds.
Resolving ⃗F and ⃗r into components, ⃗F = F1⃗i +F2⃗j and ⃗r (t) = x(t)⃗i +y(t)⃗j , the deﬁnition
of a ﬂow line tells us that x(t) and y(t) satisfy the system of differential equations
x′(t) = F1(x(t), y(t))
and
y′(t) = F2(x(t), y(t)).
Solving these differential equations gives a parameterization of the ﬂow line.

17.4 THE FLOW OF A VECTOR FIELD
945
Example 1
Find the ﬂow line of the constant velocity ﬁeld ⃗v = 3⃗i + 4⃗j cm/sec that passes through the point
(1, 2) at time t = 0.
Solution
Let ⃗r (t) = x(t)⃗i + y(t)⃗j be the position in cm of a particle at time t, where t is in seconds. We
have
x′(t) = 3
and
y′(t) = 4.
Thus,
x(t) = 3t + x0
and
y(t) = 4t + y0.
Since the path passes the point (1, 2) at t = 0, we have x0 = 1 and y0 = 2 and so
x(t) = 3t + 1
and
y(t) = 4t + 2.
Thus, the path is the line given parametrically by
⃗r (t) = (3t + 1)⃗i + (4t + 2)⃗j .
(See Figure 17.36.) To ﬁnd an explicit equation for the path, eliminate t between these expressions

Solving for x(t) ﬁrst, we get x(t) = t + x0, where x0 is a constant of integration. Thus, y′(t) =
t + x0, so y(t) = 1
2t2 + x0t + y0, where y0 is also a constant of integration. Since x(0) = x0 = −2

⃗r (t) = (t −2)⃗i + ( 1
2t2 −2t + 2)⃗j .
The graph of this ﬂow line in Figure 17.38 looks like a parabola. We check this by seeing that an
explicit equation for the path is y = 1
2x2.
Example 3
Determine the ﬂow of the vector ﬁeld ⃗v = −y⃗i + x⃗j .
Solution
Figure 17.39 suggests that the ﬂow consists of concentric counterclockwise circles, centered at the
origin. The system of differential equations for the ﬂow is
x′(t) = −y(t)
y′(t) = x(t).
The equations (x(t), y(t)) = (a cos t, a sin t) parameterize a family of counterclockwise circles
of radius a, centered at the origin. We check that this family satisﬁes the system of differential
equations:
x′(t) = −a sin t = −y(t)
and
y′(t) = a cost = x(t).

Approximating Flow Lines Numerically
Often it is not possible to ﬁnd formulas for the ﬂow lines of a vector ﬁeld. However, we can ap-
proximate them numerically by Euler’s method for solving differential equations. Since the ﬂow
lines ⃗r (t) = x(t)⃗i + y(t)⃗j of a vector ﬁeld ⃗v = ⃗F (x, y) satisfy the differential equation ⃗r ′(t) =
⃗F (⃗r (t)), we have
⃗r (t + Δt) ≈⃗r (t) + (Δt)⃗r ′(t)
= ⃗r (t) + (Δt)⃗F (⃗r (t))
for Δt near 0.
To approximate a ﬂow line, we start at a point ⃗r 0 = ⃗r (0) and estimate the position ⃗r 1 of a particle
at time Δt later:
⃗r 1 = ⃗r (Δt) ≈⃗r (0) + (Δt)⃗F (⃗r (0))
= ⃗r 0 + (Δt)⃗F (⃗r 0).

17.4 THE FLOW OF A VECTOR FIELD
947
We then repeat the same procedure starting at ⃗r 1, and so on. The general formula for getting from
one point to the next is
⃗r n+1 = ⃗r n + (Δt)⃗F (⃗r n).
The points with position vectors ⃗r 0, ⃗r 1, ...trace out the path, as shown in the next example.
Example 4
Use Euler’s method to approximate the ﬂow line through (1, 2) for the vector ﬁeld ⃗v = y2⃗i +2x2⃗j .
Solution
The ﬂow is determined by the differential equations ⃗r ′(t) = ⃗v , or equivalently
x′(t) = y2,
y′(t) = 2x2.
We use Euler’s method with Δt = 0.02, giving
⃗r n+1 = ⃗r n + 0.02⃗v (xn, yn)
= xn⃗i + yn⃗j + 0.02(y2
n⃗i + 2x2
n⃗j ),
or equivalently,
xn+1 = xn + 0.02yn
2,
yn+1 = yn + 0.02 · 2xn
2.
When t = 0, we have (x0, y0) = (1, 2). Then
x1 = x0 + 0.02 · y0
2 = 1 + 0.02 · 22 = 1.08,
y1 = y0 + 0.02 · 2x2
0 = 2 + 0.02 · 2 · 12 = 2.04.
So after one step x(0.02) ≈1.08 and y(0.02) ≈2.04. Similarly, x(0.04) = x(2Δt) ≈1.16,
y(0.04) = y(2Δt) ≈2.08 and so on. Farther values along the ﬂow line are given in Table 17.2 and
plotted in Figure 17.40.

2. Kepler’s Second Law
The planets do not orbit in circles with the sun at the center, nor does the moon orbit in a circle
with the earth at the center. In fact, the moon’s distance from the earth varies from 220,000 to
260,000 miles. In the last half of the 16th century the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe (1546–
1601) made measurements of the positions of the planets. Johann Kepler (1571–1630) studied
this data and arrived at three laws now known as Kepler’s Laws:
I. The orbit of each planet is an ellipse with the sun at one focus. In particular, the orbit lies
in a plane containing the sun.
II. As a planet orbits around the sun, the line segment from the sun to the planet sweeps out
equal areas in equal times. See Figure 17.43.
III. The ratio p2/d3 is the same for every planet orbiting around the sun, where p is the period of
the orbit (time to complete one revolution) and d is the mean distance of the orbit (average
of the shortest and farthest distances from the sun).
Kepler’s Laws, impressive as they are, were purely descriptive; Newton’s great achieve-
ment was to ﬁnd an underlying cause for them. In this project, you will derive Kepler’s Second
Law from Newton’s Law of Gravity.
Consider a coordinate system centered at the sun.3 Let ⃗r be the position vector of a planet
and let ⃗v and ⃗a be the planet’s velocity and acceleration, respectively. Deﬁne ⃗L = ⃗r × ⃗v .
(This is a multiple of the planet’s angular momentum.)
(a) Show that d⃗L
dt = ⃗r × ⃗a .
(b) Consider the planet moving from ⃗r to ⃗r + Δ⃗r . Explain why the area ΔA about the origin
swept out by the planet is approximately 1

(c) Using part (b), explain why dA
dt = 1

(d) Newton’s Laws imply that the planet’s gravitational acceleration, ⃗a , is directed toward the
sun. Using this fact and part (a), explain why ⃗L is constant.
(e) Use parts (c) and (d) to explain Kepler’s Second Law.
(f) Using Kepler’s Second Law, determine whether a planet is moving most quickly when it is
closest to, or farthest from, the sun.

3. Flux Diagrams
A ﬂux diagram uses ﬂow lines to represent a vector ﬁeld. The arrows drawn on a ﬂow line
indicate the direction of the vector ﬁeld. The ﬂow lines are drawn in such a way that their
density is proportional to the magnitude of the vector ﬁeld at each point. (The density is the
number of ﬂow lines per unit length along a curve perpendicular to the vector ﬁeld.)
Figure 17.44 is a ﬂux diagram for the vector ﬁeld in 2-space ⃗F
= ⃗r /∥⃗r ∥2. Since the
ﬁeld points radially away from the origin, the ﬂow lines are straight lines radiating from the
origin. The number of ﬂow lines passing through any circle centered at the origin is a constant
k. Therefore, the ﬂow lines passing through a small circle are more densely packed than those
passing through a large circle, indicating that the magnitude of the vector ﬁeld decreases as we
move away from the origin. In fact,
Density of lines = Number of lines passing through circle
Circumference of circle
=
k
2πr = k
2π 1/r,
so that the density is proportional to 1/r, the magnitude of the ﬁeld.
Sometimes we have to start new lines to make the density proportional to the magnitude.
For example, the ﬂow lines of ⃗v = x⃗i are horizontal straight lines directed away from the y-
axis. However, since the magnitude of ⃗v increases linearly with x, we have to make the density
of lines increase linearly with x. We achieve this by starting new lines at regular intervals. (See
Figure 17.45.)

THE IDEA OF A LINE INTEGRAL
Imagine that you are rowing on a river with a noticeable current. At times you may be working
against the current and at other times you may be moving with it. At the end you have a sense
of whether, overall, you were helped or hindered by the current. The line integral, deﬁned in this
section, measures the extent to which a curve in a vector ﬁeld is, overall, going with the vector ﬁeld
or against it.
Orientation of a Curve
A curve can be traced out in two directions, as shown in Figure 18.1. We need to choose one
direction before we can deﬁne a line integral.
A curve is said to be oriented if we have chosen a direction of travel on it.

Definition of the Line Integral
Consider a vector ﬁeld ⃗F and an oriented curve C. We begin by dividing C into n small, almost
straight pieces along which ⃗F is approximately constant. Each piece can be represented by a dis-
placement vector Δ⃗r i = ⃗r i+1 −⃗r i and the value of ⃗F at each point of this small piece of C is
approximately ⃗F (⃗r i). See Figures 18.2 and 18.3.

position vector ⃗r i on the curve C oriented from P to Q
Returning to our initial example, the vector ﬁeld ⃗F represents the current and the oriented curve
C is the path of the person rowing the boat. We wish to determine to what extent the vector ﬁeld ⃗F
helps or hinders motion along C. Since the dot product can be used to measure to what extent two
vectors point in the same or opposing directions, we form the dot product ⃗F (⃗r i) · Δ⃗r i for each
point with position vector ⃗r i on C. Summing over all such pieces, we get a Riemann sum:
n−1

i=0
⃗F (⃗r i) · Δ⃗r i.
We deﬁne the line integral, written

C ⃗F · d⃗r , by taking the limit as ∥Δ⃗r i∥→0. Provided the
limit exists, we make the following deﬁnition:


i=0
⃗F (⃗r i) · Δ⃗r i.
How Does the Limit Defining a Line Integral Work?
The limit in the deﬁnition of a line integral exists if ⃗F is continuous on the curve C and if C is made
by joining end to end a ﬁnite number of smooth curves. (A vector ﬁeld ⃗F = F1⃗i + F2⃗j + F3⃗k is
continuous if F1, F2, and F3 are continuous, and a smooth curve is one that can be parameterized
by smooth functions.) We subdivide the curve using a parameterization which goes from one end
of the curve to the other, in the forward direction, without retracing any portion of the curve. A
subdivision of the parameter interval gives a subdivision of the curve. All the curves we consider in
this book are piecewise smooth in this sense. Section 18.2 shows how to use a parameterization to
compute a line integral.
Example 1
Find the line integral of the constant vector ﬁeld ⃗F =⃗i + 2⃗j along the path from (1, 1) to (10, 10)
shown in Figure 18.4.

Figure 18.4: The constant vector ﬁeld ⃗F =⃗i + 2⃗j and the path from (1, 1) to (10, 10)
Solution
Let C1 be the horizontal segment of the path going from (1, 1) to (10, 1). When we break this path
into pieces, each piece Δ⃗r is horizontal, so Δ⃗r = Δx⃗i and ⃗F · Δ⃗r = (⃗i + 2⃗j ) · Δx⃗i = Δx.
Hence,

C1
⃗F · d⃗r =
 x=10

Similarly, along the vertical segment C2, we have Δ⃗r = Δy⃗j and ⃗F ·Δ⃗r = (⃗i +2⃗j )·Δy⃗j = 2Δy,
so

C2
⃗F · d⃗r =

⃗F · d⃗r = 9 + 18 = 27.
What Does the Line Integral Tell Us?
Remember that for any two vectors ⃗u and ⃗v , the dot product ⃗u · ⃗v is positive if ⃗u and ⃗v point
roughly in the same direction (that is, if the angle between them is less than π/2). The dot product
is zero if ⃗u is perpendicular to ⃗v and is negative if they point roughly in opposite directions (that is,
if the angle between them is greater than π/2).

960
Chapter Eighteen LINE INTEGRALS
The line integral of ⃗F adds the dot products of ⃗F and Δ⃗r along the path. If ||⃗F || is constant,
the line integral gives a positive number if ⃗F is mostly pointing in the same direction as C, and a
negative number if ⃗F is mostly pointing in the opposite direction to C. The line integral is zero if
⃗F is perpendicular to the path at all points or if the positive and negative contributions cancel out.
In general, the line integral of a vector ﬁeld ⃗F along a curve C measures the extent to which C is
going with ⃗F or against it.
Example 2
The vector ﬁeld ⃗F and the oriented curves C1, C2, C3, C4 are shown in Figure 18.5. The curves C1
and C3 are the same length. Which of the line integrals

Ci ⃗F · d⃗r , for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, are positive?
Which are negative? Arrange these line integrals in ascending order.
C2
C3
C4
C1
Figure 18.5: Vector ﬁeld and paths C1, C2, C3, C4
Solution
The vector ﬁeld ⃗F and the line segments Δ⃗r are approximately parallel and in the same direction
for the curves C1, C2, and C3. So the contributions of each term ⃗F · Δ⃗r are positive for these
curves. Thus, 
C1 ⃗F ·d⃗r , 
C2 ⃗F ·d⃗r , and 
C3 ⃗F ·d⃗r are each positive. For the curve C4, the vector
ﬁeld and the line segments are in opposite directions, so each term ⃗F ·Δ⃗r is negative, and therefore
the integral

C4 ⃗F · d⃗r is negative.
Since the magnitude of the vector ﬁeld is smaller along C1 than along C3, and these two curves
are the same length, we have

C1
⃗F · d⃗r <

C3
⃗F · d⃗r .
In addition, the magnitude of the vector ﬁeld is the same along C2 and C3, but the curve C2 is longer
than the curve C3. Thus,

C3
⃗F · d⃗r <

C2
⃗F · d⃗r .
Putting these results together with the fact that

C4 ⃗F · d⃗r is negative, we have

Interpretations of the Line Integral
Work
Recall from Section 13.3 that if a constant force ⃗F acts on an object while it moves along a straight
line through a displacement ⃗d , the work done by the force on the object is
Work done = ⃗F · ⃗d .
Now suppose we want to ﬁnd the work done by gravity on an object moving far above the surface
of the earth. Since the force of gravity varies with distance from the earth and the path may not

18.1 THE IDEA OF A LINE INTEGRAL
961
be straight, we can’t use the formula ⃗F · ⃗d . We approximate the path by line segments which are
small enough that the force is approximately constant on each one. Suppose the force at a point with
position vector ⃗r is ⃗F (⃗r ), as in Figures 18.2 and 18.3. Then
Work done by force ⃗F (⃗r i)

⃗F (⃗r i) · Δ⃗r i,
and so,

A mass lying on a ﬂat table is attached to a spring whose other end is fastened to the wall. (See
Figure 18.6.) The spring is extended 20 cm beyond its rest position and released. If the axes are as
shown in Figure 18.6, when the spring is extended by a distance of x, the force exerted by the spring
on the mass is given by
⃗F (x) = −kx⃗i ,
where k is a positive constant that depends on the strength of the spring.
Suppose the mass moves back to the rest position. How much work is done by the force exerted

Figure 18.7: Dividing up the

Solution
The path from x = 20 to x = 0 is divided as shown in Figure 18.7, with a typical segment repre-
sented by
Δ⃗r = Δx⃗i .
Since we are moving from x = 20 to x = 0, the quantity Δx will be negative. The work done by
the force as the mass moves through this segment is approximated by
Work done ≈⃗F · Δ⃗r = (−kx⃗i ) · (Δx⃗i ) = −kx Δx.
Thus, we have
Total work done ≈

−kx Δx.
In the limit, as ∥Δx∥→0, this sum becomes an ordinary deﬁnite integral. Since the path starts at
x = 20, this is the lower limit of integration; x = 0 is the upper limit. Thus, we get

Chapter Eighteen LINE INTEGRALS
Example 3 shows how a line integral over a path parallel to the x-axis reduces to a one-variable
integral. Section 18.2 shows how to convert any line integral into a one-variable integral.
Example 4
A particle with position vector ⃗r is subject to a force, ⃗F , due to gravity. What is the sign of the
work done by ⃗F as the particle moves along the path C1, a radial line through the center of the
earth, starting 8000 km from the center and ending 10,000 km from the center? (See Figure 18.8.)
Solution
We divide the path into small radial segments, Δ⃗r , pointing away from the center of the earth and
parallel to the gravitational force. The vectors ⃗F and Δ⃗r point in opposite directions, so each term
⃗F · Δ⃗r is negative. Adding all these negative quantities and taking the limit results in a negative
value for the total work. Thus, the work done by gravity is negative. The negative sign indicates that
we would have to do work against gravity to move the particle along the path C1.

Example 5
Find the sign of the work done by gravity along the curve C1 in Example 4, but with the opposite
orientation.
Solution
Tracing a curve in the opposite direction changes the sign of the line integral because all the seg-
ments Δ⃗r change direction, and so every term ⃗F · Δ⃗r changes sign. Thus, the result will be the
negative of the answer found in Example 4. Therefore, the work done by gravity as a particle moves
along C1 toward the center of the earth is positive.
Example 6
Find the work done by gravity as a particle moves along C2, an arc of a circle 8000 km long at a
distance of 8000 km from the center of the earth. (See Figure 18.8.)
Solution
Since C2 is everywhere perpendicular to the gravitational force, ⃗F · Δ⃗r = 0 for all Δ⃗r along C2.
Thus,
Work done =

C2
⃗F · d⃗r = 0,
so the work done is zero. This is why satellites can remain in orbit without expending any fuel, once
they have attained the correct altitude and velocity.
Circulation
The velocity vector ﬁeld for the Gulf Stream on page 937 shows distinct eddies or regions where
the water circulates. We can measure this circulation using a closed curve, that is, one that starts and
ends at the same point.
If C is an oriented closed curve, the line integral of a vector ﬁeld ⃗F around C is called the
circulation of ⃗F around C.

18.1 THE IDEA OF A LINE INTEGRAL
963
Circulation is a measure of the net tendency of the vector ﬁeld to point around the curve C. To
emphasize that C is closed, the circulation is sometimes denoted

C ⃗F · d⃗r , with a small circle on
the integral sign.
Example 7

Figure 18.10: A ﬂow with zero
circulation
Solution
Consider the vector ﬁeld in Figure 18.9. If you think of this as representing the velocity of water
ﬂowing in a pond, you see that the water is circulating. The line integral around C1, measuring the
circulation around C1, is positive, because the vectors of the ﬁeld are all pointing in the direction of
the path. By way of contrast, look at the vector ﬁeld in Figure 18.10. Here the line integral around C2
is zero because the vertical portions of the path are perpendicular to the ﬁeld and the contributions
from the two horizontal portions cancel out. This means that there is no net tendency for the water
to circulate around C2.
It turns out that the vector ﬁeld in Figure 18.10 has the property that its circulation around any
closed path is zero. Water moving according to this vector ﬁeld has no tendency to circulate around
any point, and a leaf dropped into the water will not spin. We’ll look at such special ﬁelds again
later when we introduce the notion of the curl of a vector ﬁeld.
Properties of Line Integrals
Line integrals share some basic properties with ordinary one-variable integrals:

Properties 3 and 4 are concerned with the curve C over which the line integral is taken. If C
is an oriented curve, then −C is the same curve traversed in the opposite direction, that is, with the
opposite orientation. (See Figure 18.11 on page 964.) Property 3 holds because if we integrate along
−C, the vectors Δ⃗r point in the opposite direction and the dot products ⃗F · Δ⃗r are the negatives
of what they were along C.

If C1 and C2 are oriented curves with C1 ending where C2 begins, we construct a new oriented
curve, called C1 + C2, by joining them together. (See Figure 18.12.) Property 4 is the analogue for

COMPUTING LINE INTEGRALS OVER PARAMETERIZED CURVES
The goal of this section is to show how to use a parameterization of a curve to convert a line integral
into an ordinary one-variable integral.
Using a Parameterization to Evaluate a Line Integral


C
⃗F · d⃗r =
lim
∥Δ⃗r i∥→0
 ⃗F (⃗r i) · Δ⃗r i,

Chapter Eighteen LINE INTEGRALS
where the ⃗r i are the position vectors of points subdividing the curve into short pieces. Now suppose
we have a smooth parameterization, ⃗r (t), of C for a ≤t ≤b, so that ⃗r (a) is the position vector
of the starting point of the curve and ⃗r (b) is the position vector of the end. Then we can divide C
into n pieces by dividing the interval a ≤t ≤b into n pieces, each of size Δt = (b −a)/n. See
Figures 18.19 and 18.20.
At each point ⃗r i = ⃗r (ti) we want to compute
⃗F (⃗r i) · Δ⃗r i.

≈⃗r ′(ti)Δt,
where we use the facts that Δt is small and that ⃗r (t) is differentiable to obtain the last approxima-

Therefore,

C
⃗F · d⃗r ≈
 ⃗F (⃗r i) · Δ⃗r i ≈
 ⃗F (⃗r (ti)) · ⃗r ′(ti) Δt.
Notice that ⃗F (⃗r (ti)) · ⃗r ′(ti) is the value at ti of a one-variable function of t, so this last sum is
really a one-variable Riemann sum. In the limit as Δt →0, we get a deﬁnite integral:
lim
Δt→0
 ⃗F (⃗r (ti)) · ⃗r ′(ti) Δt =
 b
a
⃗F (⃗r (t)) · ⃗r ′(t) dt.
Thus, we have the following result:
If ⃗r (t), for a ≤t ≤b, is a smooth parameterization of an oriented curve C and ⃗F is a vector
ﬁeld which is continuous on C, then

C
⃗F · d⃗r =
 b
a
⃗F (⃗r (t)) · ⃗r ′(t) dt.
In words: To compute the line integral of ⃗F over C, take the dot product of ⃗F evaluated on C
with the velocity vector, ⃗r ′(t), of the parameterization of C, then integrate along the curve.
Even though we assumed that C is smooth, we can use the same formula to compute line
integrals over curves which are piecewise smooth, such as the boundary of a rectangle. If C is
piecewise smooth, we apply the formula to each one of the smooth pieces and add the results by
applying property 4 on page 963.

Solution
Since most of the vectors in ⃗F along C point generally in a direction opposite to the orientation of
C, we expect our answer to be negative. The ﬁrst step is to parameterize C by
⃗r (t) = x(t)⃗i + y(t)⃗j = cos t⃗i + sin t⃗j ,
0 ≤t ≤π
2 .
Substituting the parameterization into ⃗F , we get ⃗F (x(t), y(t)) = (cos t + sin t)⃗i + sin t⃗j . The
vector ⃗r ′(t) = x′(t)⃗i + y′(t)⃗j = −sin t⃗i + cos t⃗j . Then


So the answer is negative, as expected.

Chapter Eighteen LINE INTEGRALS
To parameterize C2, we use the fact that it is part of a parabola with vertex at (0, 2), so its
equation is of the form y = −kx2 + 2 for some k. Since the parabola crosses the x-axis
at (1, 0), we ﬁnd that k = 2 and y = −2x2 + 2. Therefore, we use the parameterization
⃗r (t) = t⃗i + (−2t2 + 2)⃗j with 0 ≤t ≤1, which has ⃗r ′ = ⃗i −4t⃗j . This traces out C2 in
reverse, since t = 0 gives (0, 2), and t = 1 gives (1, 0). Thus, we make t = 0 the upper limit of
integration and t = 1 the lower limit:


⃗F · d⃗r =

So the line integrals of ⃗F along C1 and C2 have the same value.

C ⃗F · d⃗r into three pieces, one of which we have already computed (namely, the
piece connecting (1, 0) to (0, 2), where the line integral has value 3/2). The piece running from
(0, 2) to (0, 0) can be parameterized by ⃗r (t) = (2 −t)⃗j with 0 ≤t ≤2. The piece running
from (0, 0) to (1, 0) can be parameterized by ⃗r (t) = t⃗i with 0 ≤t ≤1. Then

C2 ⃗F · d⃗r = 0, since the vector ﬁeld ⃗F has no⃗i component along the x-axis
(where y = 0) and is therefore perpendicular to C2 at all points.
Finally, we can write

C

⃗F · d⃗r = π + 0 = π.
It is no accident that the result for

18.2 COMPUTING LINE INTEGRALS OVER PARAMETERIZED CURVES
971
The next example illustrates the computation of a line integral over a path in 3-space.
Example 4
A particle travels along the helix C given by ⃗r (t) = cos t⃗i + sin t⃗j + 2t⃗k and is subject to a force
⃗F = x⃗i + z⃗j −xy⃗k . Find the total work done on the particle by the force for 0 ≤t ≤3π.

The work done is given by a line integral, which we evaluate using the given parameterization:

The Differential Notation

There is an alternative notation for line integrals that is often useful. For the vector ﬁeld ⃗F
=
P(x, y, z)⃗i +Q(x, y, z)⃗j +R(x, y, z)⃗k and an oriented curve C, if we write d⃗r = dx⃗i +dy⃗j +dz⃗k
we have

C
⃗F · d⃗r =

P(x, y, z)dx + Q(x, y, z)dy + R(x, y, z)dz.

Evaluate

We parameterize C by x = t, y = 3t, 0 ≤t ≤2. Thus, dx = dt, dy = 3dt, so


Line integrals can be expressed either using vectors or using differentials. If the independent
variables are distances, then visualizing a line integral in terms of dot products can be useful. How-
ever, if the independent variables are, for example, temperature and volume, then the dot product
does not have physical meaning, so differentials are more natural.
Independence of Parameterization
Since there are many different ways of parameterizing a given oriented curve, you may be wondering
what happens to the value of a given line integral if you choose another parameterization. The
answer is that the choice of parameterization makes no difference. Since we initially deﬁned the line
integral without reference to any particular parameterization, this is exactly as we would expect.
Example 6
Consider the oriented path which is a straight-line segment L running from (0, 0) to (1, 1). Calculate
the line integral of the vector ﬁeld ⃗F = (3x−y)⃗i +x⃗j along L using each of the parameterizations
(a)
A(t) = (t, t),
0 ≤t ≤1,
(b)
D(t) = (et −1, et −1),
0 ≤t ≤ln 2.
Solution
The line L has equation y = x. Both A(t) and D(t) give a parameterization of L: each has both
coordinates equal and each begins at (0,0) and ends at (1,1). Now let’s calculate the line integral of
the vector ﬁeld ⃗F = (3x −y)⃗i + x⃗j using each parameterization.
(a) Using A(t), we get

The fact that both answers are the same illustrates that the value of a line integral is independent
of the parameterization of the path. Problems 38–40 at the end of this section give another way of
seeing this.

GRADIENT FIELDS AND PATH-INDEPENDENT FIELDS
For a function, f, of one variable, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus tells us that the deﬁnite
integral of a rate of change, f ′, gives the total change in f:
 b
a
f ′(t) dt = f(b) −f(a).
What about functions of two or more variables? The quantity that describes the rate of change
is the gradient vector ﬁeld. If we know the gradient of a function f, can we compute the total change
in f between two points? The answer is yes, using a line integral.

Finding the Total Change in f from grad f: The Fundamental Theorem
To ﬁnd the change in f between two points P and Q, we choose a smooth path C from P to Q, then
divide the path into many small pieces. See Figure 18.26.
First we estimate the change in f as we move through a displacement Δ⃗r i from ⃗r i to ⃗r i+1.
Suppose ⃗u is a unit vector in the direction of Δ⃗r i. Then the change in f is given by
f(⃗r i+1) −f(⃗r i) ≈Rate of change of f × Distance moved in direction of ⃗u
= f⃗u (⃗r i)∥Δ⃗r i∥
= grad f · ⃗u ∥Δ⃗r i∥
= grad f · Δ⃗r i.
since Δ⃗r i = ∥Δ⃗r i∥⃗u
Therefore, summing over all pieces of the path, the total change in f is given by
Total change = f(Q) −f(P) ≈
n−1

i=0
gradf(⃗r i) · Δ⃗r i.
In the limit as ∥Δ⃗ri ∥approaches zero, this suggests the following result:
Theorem 18.1: The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for Line Integrals
Suppose C is a piecewise smooth oriented path with starting point P and ending point Q. If
f is a function whose gradient is continuous on the path C, then

C
grad f · d⃗r = f(Q) −f(P).
Notice that there are many different paths from P to Q. (See Figure 18.27.) However, the value
of the line integral

C gradf·d⃗r depends only on the endpoints of C; it does not depend on where C
goes in between. Problem 61 on page 984 shows how the Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals
can be derived from the one-variable Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

Solution
(a) The gradient of f is everywhere perpendicular to the path from P to Q, as you expect along a
contour.
(b) Consider the path from P to Q shown in Figure 18.28 and evaluate the line integral

C
gradf · d⃗r = f(Q) −f(P).
Since gradf is everywhere perpendicular to the path, the line integral is 0. Thus, f(Q) = f(P).

Consider the vector ﬁeld ⃗F = x⃗i + y⃗j . In Example 2 on page 969 we calculated

C1 ⃗F · d⃗r and

C2 ⃗F · d⃗r over the oriented curves shown in Figure 18.29 and found they were the same. Find a
scalar function f with grad f = ⃗F . Hence, ﬁnd an easy way to calculate the line integrals, and
explain how we could have expected them to be the same.

One possibility for f is

You can check that gradf = x⃗i + y⃗j . Now we can use the Fundamental Theorem to compute the
line integral. Since ⃗F = gradf we have

C1
⃗F · d⃗r =

C1
gradf · d⃗r = f(0, 2) −f(1, 0) = 3
2.
Notice that the calculation looks exactly the same for C2. Since the value of the integral depends
only on the values of f at the endpoints, it is the same no matter what path we choose.
Path-Independent, or Conservative, Vector Fields
In the previous example, the line integral was independent of the path taken between the two (ﬁxed)
endpoints. We give vector ﬁelds whose line integrals have this property a special name.
A vector ﬁeld ⃗F is said to be path-independent, or conservative, if for any two points P
and Q, the line integral 
C ⃗F · d⃗r has the same value along any piecewise smooth path C
from P to Q lying in the domain of ⃗F .
If, on the other hand, the line integral

C ⃗F · d⃗r does depend on the path C joining P to Q,
then ⃗F is said to be a path-dependent vector ﬁeld.

18.3 GRADIENT FIELDS AND PATH-INDEPENDENT FIELDS
977
Now suppose that ⃗F is any continuous gradient ﬁeld, so ⃗F = gradf. If C is a path from P to
Q, the Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals tells us that

C
⃗F · d⃗r = f(Q) −f(P).
Since the right-hand side of this equation does not depend on the path, but only on the endpoints of
the path, the vector ﬁeld ⃗F is path-independent. Thus, we have the following important result:
If ⃗F
is a continuous gradient vector ﬁeld, then ⃗F
is path-
independent.
Why Do We Care About Path-Independent, or Conservative, Vector Fields?
Many of the fundamental vector ﬁelds of nature are path-independent—for example, the gravi-
tational ﬁeld and the electric ﬁeld of particles at rest. The fact that the gravitational ﬁeld is path-
independent means that the work done by gravity when an object moves depends only on the starting
and ending points and not on the path taken. For example, the work done by gravity (computed by
the line integral) on a bicycle being carried to a sixth ﬂoor apartment is the same whether it is carried
up the stairs in a zig-zag path or taken straight up in an elevator.
When a vector ﬁeld is path-independent,we can deﬁne the potential energy of a body. When the
body moves to another position, the potential energy changes by an amount equal to the work done
by the vector ﬁeld, which depends only on the starting and ending positions. If the work done had
not been path-independent, the potential energy would depend both on the body’s current position
and on how it got there, making it impossible to deﬁne a useful potential energy.
Project 1 on page 1002 explains why path-independent force vector ﬁelds are also called con-
servative vector ﬁelds: When a particle moves under the inﬂuence of a conservative vector ﬁeld, the
total energy of the particle is conserved. It turns out that the force ﬁeld is obtained from the gradient
of the potential energy function.
Path-Independent Fields and Gradient Fields
We have seen that every gradient ﬁeld is path-independent. What about the converse? That is, given
a path-independent vector ﬁeld ⃗F , can we ﬁnd a function f such that ⃗F = grad f? The answer is
yes, provided that ⃗F is continuous.
How to Construct f from −
→
F
First, notice that there are many different choices for f, since we can add a constant to f without
changing grad f. If we pick a ﬁxed starting point P, then by adding or subtracting a constant to f,
we can ensure that f(P) = 0. For any other point Q, we deﬁne f(Q) by the formula
f(Q) =

C
⃗F · d⃗r ,
where C is any path from P to Q.
Since ⃗F is path-independent, it does not matter which path we choose from P to Q. On the other
hand, if ⃗F is not path-independent, then different choices might give different values for f(Q), so
f would not be a function (a function has to have a single value at each point).
We still have to show that the gradient of the function f really is ⃗F ; we do this on page 979.
However, by constructing a function f in this manner, we have the following result:

978
Chapter Eighteen LINE INTEGRALS
Theorem 18.2: Path-independent Fields Are Gradient Fields
If ⃗F is a continuous path-independent vector ﬁeld on an open region R, then ⃗F = gradf
for some f deﬁned on R.
Combining Theorems 18.1 and 18.2, we have
A continuous vector ﬁeld ⃗F deﬁned on an open region is path-independent if
and only if ⃗F is a gradient vector ﬁeld.
The function f is sufﬁciently important that it is given a special name:
If a vector ﬁeld ⃗F is of the form ⃗F = gradf for some scalar function f, then f is called a
potential function for the vector ﬁeld ⃗F .
Warning
Physicists use the convention that a function φ is a potential function for a vector ﬁeld ⃗F if
⃗F = −gradφ. See Problem 62 on page 984.
Example 3
Show that the vector ﬁeld ⃗F (x, y) = y cos x⃗i + (sin x + y)⃗j is path-independent.
Solution
Let’s suppose ⃗F does have a potential function f, so that ⃗F = grad f. This means
∂f
∂x = y cos x
and
∂f
∂y = sin x + y.
Integrating the expression for ∂f/∂x with respect to x shows that
f(x, y) = y sin x + C(y)
where C(y) is a function of y only.
The constant of integration here is an arbitrary function C(y) of y, since ∂(C(y))/∂x = 0. Differ-
entiating this expression for f(x, y) with respect to y and using ∂f/∂y = sin x + y gives
∂f
∂y = sin x + C′(y) = sin x + y.
Thus, we must have C′(y) = y, so g(y) = y2/2 + A, where A is some constant. Thus,
f(x, y) = y sin x + y2
2 + A
is a potential function for ⃗F . Therefore, ⃗F is path-independent.
Example 4
The gravitational ﬁeld, ⃗F , of an object of mass M is given by
⃗F = −GM
r3 ⃗r .
Show that ⃗F is a gradient ﬁeld by ﬁnding a potential function for ⃗F .
Solution
The vector ⃗F points directly in toward the origin. If ⃗F = gradf, then ⃗F must be perpendicular
to the level surfaces of f, so the level surfaces of f must be spheres. Also, if grad f = ⃗F , then

18.3 GRADIENT FIELDS AND PATH-INDEPENDENT FIELDS

∥gradf∥= ∥⃗F ∥= GM/r2 is the rate of change of f in the direction toward the origin. Now,
differentiating with respect to r gives the rate of change in a radially outward direction. Thus, if

⃗r = ⃗F .
Our computations show that ⃗F is a gradient ﬁeld and that f = GM/r is a potential function for ⃗F .
Path-independent vector ﬁelds are rare, but often important. Section 18.4 gives a method for
determining whether a vector ﬁeld has the property.
Why Path-Independent Vector Fields Are Gradient Fields: Showing grad f = −
→
F
Suppose ⃗F is a path-independent vector ﬁeld. On page 977 we deﬁned the function f, which we
hope will satisfy gradf = ⃗F , as follows:
f(x0, y0) =

C
⃗F · d⃗r ,
where C is a path from a ﬁxed starting point P to a point Q = (x0, y0). This integral has the same
value for any path from P to Q because ⃗F is path-independent. Now we show why grad f = ⃗F .
We consider vector ﬁelds in 2-space; the argument in 3-space is essentially the same.
First, we write the line integral in terms of the components ⃗F (x, y) = F1(x, y)⃗i + F2(x, y)⃗j
and the components d⃗r = dx⃗i + dy⃗j :
f(x0, y0) =

C
F1(x, y)dx + F2(x, y)dy.
We want to compute the partial derivatives of f, that is, the rate of change of f at (x0, y0)
parallel to the axes. To do this easily, we choose a path which reaches the point (x0, y0) on a
horizontal or vertical line segment. Let C′ be a path from P which stops short of Q at a ﬁxed point
(a, b) and let Lx and Ly be the paths shown in Figure 18.30. Then we can split the line integral into
three pieces. Since d⃗r = ⃗j dy on Ly and d⃗r =⃗i dx on Lx, we have:
f(x0, y0) =

and thus
fx(x, y) = F1(x, y).
A similar calculation for y using the path from P to Q shown in Figure 18.31 gives
fy0(x0, y0) = F2(x0, y0).
Therefore, as we claimed,
gradf = fx⃗i + fy⃗j = F1⃗i + F2⃗j = ⃗F .

PATH-DEPENDENT VECTOR FIELDS AND GREEN’S THEOREM
Suppose we are given a vector ﬁeld but are not told whether it is path-independent. How can we tell
if it has a potential function, that is, if it is a gradient ﬁeld?
How to Tell If a Vector Field Is Path-Dependent Using Line Integrals
One way to decide if a vector ﬁeld is path-dependent is to ﬁnd two paths with the same endpoints
such that the line integrals of the vector ﬁeld along the two paths have different values.
Example 1
Is the vector ﬁeld ⃗G shown in Figure 18.41 path-independent? At any point ⃗G has magnitude equal
to the distance from the origin and direction perpendicular to the line joining the point to the origin.

path-independent?
Solution
We choose P = (1, 0) and Q = (0, 1) and two paths between them: C1, a quarter circle of radius 1,
and C2, formed by parts of the x- and y-axes. (See Figure 18.41.)

986
Chapter Eighteen LINE INTEGRALS
Along C1, the line integral

C1 ⃗G · d⃗r > 0, since ⃗G points in the direction of the curve.
Along C2, however, we have

C2 ⃗G · d⃗r = 0, since ⃗G is perpendicular to C2 everywhere.
Thus, ⃗G is not path-independent.
Path-Dependent Fields and Circulation
Notice that the vector ﬁeld in the previous example has nonzero circulation around the origin. What
can we say about the circulation of a general path-independentvector ﬁeld ⃗F around a closed curve,
C? Suppose C is a simple closed curve, that is, a closed curve that does not cross itself. If P and Q
are any two points on the path, then we can think of C (oriented as shown in Figure 18.42) as made
up of the path C1 followed by −C2. Since ⃗F is path-independent, we know that

C1
⃗F · d⃗r =

C2
⃗F · d⃗r .
Thus, we see that the circulation around C is zero:

C
⃗F · d⃗r =

C1
⃗F · d⃗r +

−C2
⃗F · d⃗r =

C1
⃗F · d⃗r −

C2
⃗F · d⃗r = 0.
If the closed curve C does cross itself, we break it into simple closed curves as shown in Figure 18.43
and apply the same argument to each one.
Now suppose we know that the line integral around any closed curve is zero. For any two points,
P and Q, with two paths, C1 and C2, between them, create a closed curve, C, as in Figure 18.42.
Since the circulation around this closed curve, C, is zero, the line integrals along the two paths, C1
and C2, are equal.2 Thus, ⃗F is path-independent.

Thus, we have the following result:
A vector ﬁeld is path-independent if and only if

C
⃗F · d⃗r = 0 for every closed curve C.
Hence, to see if a ﬁeld is path-dependent, we look for a closed path with nonzero circulation.
For instance, the vector ﬁeld in Example 1 has nonzero circulation around a circle around the origin,
showing it is path-dependent.
How to Tell If a Vector Field Is Path-Dependent Algebraically: The Curl
Example 2
Does the vector ﬁeld ⃗F = 2xy⃗i + xy⃗j have a potential function? If so, ﬁnd it.
Solution
Let’s suppose ⃗F does have a potential function, f, so ⃗F = gradf. This means that
∂f
∂x = 2xy
and
∂f
∂y = xy.
2A similar argument is used in Problems 46 and 47 on page 966.

18.4 PATH-DEPENDENT VECTOR FIELDS AND GREEN’S THEOREM
987
Integrating the expression for ∂f/∂x shows that we must have
f(x, y) = x2y + C(y)
where C(y) is a function of y.
Differentiating this expression for f(x, y) with respect to y and using the fact that ∂f/∂y = xy, we
get
∂f
∂y = x2 + C′(y) = xy.
Thus, we must have
C′(y) = xy −x2.
But this expression for C′(y) is impossible because C′(y) is a function of y alone. This argument
shows that there is no potential function for the vector ﬁeld ⃗F .
Is there an easier way to see that a vector ﬁeld has no potential function, other than by trying to
ﬁnd the potential function and failing? The answer is yes. First we look at a 2-dimensional vector
ﬁeld ⃗F = F1⃗i + F2⃗j . If ⃗F is a gradient ﬁeld, then there is a potential function f such that
⃗F = F1⃗i + F2⃗j = ∂f
∂x
⃗i + ∂f
∂y
⃗j .
Thus,
F1 = ∂f
∂x
and
F2 = ∂f
∂y .
Let us assume that f has continuous second partial derivatives. Then, by the equality of mixed
partial derivatives,
∂F1
∂y = ∂2f
∂y∂x = ∂2f
∂x∂y = ∂F2
∂x .
Thus, we have the following result:
If ⃗F (x, y) = F1⃗i + F2⃗j is a gradient vector ﬁeld with continuous partial derivatives, then
∂F2
∂x −∂F1
∂y = 0.
If ⃗F (x, y) = F1⃗i + F2⃗j is an arbitrary vector ﬁeld, then we deﬁne the 2-dimensional or
scalar curl of the vector ﬁeld ⃗F to be
∂F2
∂x −∂F1
∂y .
Notice that we now know that if ⃗F is a gradient ﬁeld, then its curl is 0. We do not (yet) know
whether the converse is true. (That is: If the curl is 0, does ⃗F have to be a gradient ﬁeld?) However,
the curl already enables us to show that a vector ﬁeld is not a gradient ﬁeld.
Example 3
Show that ⃗F = 2xy⃗i + xy⃗j cannot be a gradient vector ﬁeld.
Solution
We have F1 = 2xy and F2 = xy. Since ∂F1/∂y = 2x and ∂F2/∂x = y, in this case
∂F2/∂x −∂F1/∂y ̸= 0
so ⃗F cannot be a gradient ﬁeld.

Chapter Eighteen LINE INTEGRALS
Green’s Theorem
We now have two ways of seeing that a vector ﬁeld ⃗F in the plane is path-dependent. We can
evaluate

C ⃗F · d⃗r for some closed curve and ﬁnd it is not zero, or we can show that
∂F2/∂x −∂F1/∂y ̸= 0. It’s natural to think that

C
⃗F · d⃗r
and
∂F2

might be related. The relation is called Green’s Theorem.
Theorem 18.3: Green’s Theorem
Suppose C is a piecewise smooth simple closed curve that is the boundary of a region R
in the plane and oriented so that the region is on the left as we move around the curve. See
Figure 18.44. Suppose ⃗F = F1⃗i +F2⃗j is a smooth vector ﬁeld on an open region containing
R and C. Then

We ﬁrst prove Green’s Theorem in the case where the region R is the rectangle a ≤x ≤b, c ≤
y ≤d. Figure 18.45 shows the boundary of R divided into four curves.

If R is not a rectangle, we subdivide it into small rectangular pieces as shown in Figure 18.46.
The contribution to the integral of the non-rectangular pieces can be made as small as we like by
making the subdivision ﬁne enough. The double integrals over each piece add up to the double
integral over the whole region R. Figure 18.47 shows how the circulations around adjacent pieces
cancel along the common edge, so the circulations around all the pieces add up to the circulation
around the boundary C. Since Green’s Theorem holds for the rectangular pieces, it holds for the
whole region R.

Chapter Eighteen LINE INTEGRALS
Thus, ⃗F is path-independent and therefore a gradient ﬁeld. This argument is valid for every closed
curve, C, provided the region R is entirely in the domain of ⃗F . Thus, we have the following result:
The Curl Test for Vector Fields in 2-Space
Suppose ⃗F = F1⃗i + F2⃗j is a vector ﬁeld with continuous partial derivatives such that
• The domain of ⃗F has the property that every closed curve in it encircles a region that
lies entirely within the domain. In particular, the domain of ⃗F has no holes.
• ∂F2
∂x −∂F1
∂y = 0.
Then ⃗F is path-independent, so ⃗F is a gradient ﬁeld and has a potential function.
Why Are Holes in the Domain of the Vector Field Important?
The reason for assuming that the domain of the vector ﬁeld ⃗F has no holes is to ensure that the
region R inside C is actually contained in the domain of ⃗F . Otherwise, we cannot apply Green’s
Theorem. The next two examples show that if ∂F2/∂x−∂F1/∂y = 0 but the domain of ⃗F contains
a hole, then ⃗F can either be path-independent or path-dependent.
Example 5
Let ⃗F be the vector ﬁeld given by ⃗F (x, y) = −y⃗i + x⃗j
x2 + y2 .
(a) Calculate ∂F2
∂x −∂F1
∂y . Does the curl test imply that ⃗F is path-independent?
(b) Calculate

C
⃗F ·d⃗r , where C is the unit circle centered at the origin and oriented counterclock-
wise. Is ⃗F a path-independent vector ﬁeld?
(c) Explain why the answers to parts (a) and (b) do not contradict Green’s Theorem.
Solution
(a) Taking partial derivatives, we have
∂F2
∂x = ∂

x

x2 + y2 −

−y
x2 + y2

=
−1
x2 + y2 +
y · 2y
(x2 + y2)2 =
y2 −x2
(x2 + y2)2 .
Thus,
∂F2
∂x −∂F1
∂y = 0.
Since ⃗F is undeﬁned at the origin, the domain of ⃗F contains a hole. Therefore, the curl test
does not apply.
(b) On the unit circle, ⃗F is tangent to the circle and ||⃗F || = 1. Thus,3

C
⃗F · d⃗r = ||⃗F || · Length of curve = 1 · 2π = 2π.
Since the line integral around the closed curve C is nonzero, ⃗F is not path-independent. We ob-
serve that ⃗F = grad(arctan(y/x)) and arctan(y/x) is θ from polar coordinates, for −π/2 <
θ < π/2. The fact that θ increases by 2π each time we wind once around the origin counter-
clockwise explains why ⃗F is not path-independent.

18.4 PATH-DEPENDENT VECTOR FIELDS AND GREEN’S THEOREM
991
(c) The domain of ⃗F is the “punctured plane,” as shown in Figure 18.48. Since ⃗F is not deﬁned at
the origin, which is inside C, Green’s Theorem does not apply. In this case

Although the vector ﬁeld ⃗F in the last example was not deﬁned at the origin, this by itself does
not prevent the vector ﬁeld from being path-independent, as we see in the following example.
Example 6
Consider the vector ﬁeld ⃗F given by ⃗F (x, y) = x⃗i + y⃗j
x2 + y2 .
(a) Calculate ∂F2
∂x −∂F1
∂y . Does the curl test imply that ⃗F is path-independent?
(b) Explain how we know that

C
⃗F · d⃗r = 0, where C is the unit circle centered at the origin and
oriented counterclockwise. Does this imply that ⃗F is path-independent?
(c) Check that f(x, y) = 1
2 ln(x2 + y2) is a potential function for ⃗F . Does this imply that ⃗F is
path-independent?
Solution
(a) Taking partial derivatives, we have
∂F2
∂x = ∂

and

=

(x2 + y2)2 .
Therefore,
∂F2
∂x −∂F1
∂y = 0.
This does not imply that ⃗F is path-independent: The domain of ⃗F contains a hole since ⃗F is
undeﬁned at the origin. Thus, the curl test does not apply.
(b) Since ⃗F (x, y) = x⃗i + y⃗j = ⃗r on the unit circle C, the ﬁeld ⃗F is everywhere perpendicular to
C. Thus

C
⃗F · d⃗r = 0.
The fact that

C ⃗F ·d⃗r = 0 when C is the unit circle does not imply that ⃗F is path-independent.
To be sure that ⃗F is path-independent, we would have to show that

C ⃗F · d⃗r = 0 for every
closed curve C in the domain of ⃗F , not just the unit circle.
(c) To check that gradf = ⃗F , we differentiate f:
fx = 1

and

∂

2y
x2 + y2 =

x2 + y2 ,
so that
grad f = x⃗i + y⃗j
x2 + y2 = ⃗F .
Thus, ⃗F is a gradient ﬁeld and therefore is path-independent—even though ⃗F is undeﬁned at
the origin.
The Curl Test for Vector Fields in 3-Space
The curl test is a convenientway of deciding whether a 2-dimensional vector ﬁeld is path-independent.
Fortunately, there is an analogous test for 3-dimensional vector ﬁelds, although we cannot justify it
until Chapter 20.
If ⃗F (x, y, z) = F1⃗i + F2⃗j + F3⃗k is a vector ﬁeld on 3-space we deﬁne a new vector ﬁeld,
curl ⃗F , on 3-space by
curl ⃗F =

∂y −∂F2

⃗i +
∂F1
∂z −∂F3
∂x

⃗j +
∂F2
∂x −∂F1
∂y

⃗k .
The vector ﬁeld curl ⃗F can be used to determine whether the vector ﬁeld ⃗F is path-independent.
The Curl Test for Vector Fields in 3-Space
Suppose ⃗F is a vector ﬁeld on 3-space with continuous partial derivatives such that
• The domain of ⃗F has the property that every closed curve in it can be contracted to a
point in a smooth way, staying at all times within the domain.
• curl ⃗F = ⃗0 .
Then ⃗F is path-independent, so ⃗F is a gradient ﬁeld and has a potential function.
For the 2-dimensional curl test, the domain of ⃗F must have no holes. This meant that if ⃗F was
deﬁned on a simple closed curve C, then it was also deﬁned at all points inside C. One way to test
for holes is to try to “lasso” them with a closed curve. If every closed curve in the domain can be
pulled to a point without hitting a hole, that is, without straying outside the domain, then the domain
has no holes. In 3-space, we need the same condition to be satisﬁed: we must be able to pull every
closed curve to a point, like a lasso, without straying outside the domain.
Example 7
Decide if the following vector ﬁelds are path-independent and whether or not the curl test applies.
(a)
⃗F =
x⃗i + y⃗j + z⃗k
(x2 + y2 + z2)3/2
(b)
⃗G = −y⃗i + x⃗j
x2 + y2
+ z2⃗k
Solution
(a) Suppose f = −(x2 +y2 +z2)−1/2. Then fx = x(x2 + y2 + z2)−3/2 and fy and fz are similar,
so gradf = ⃗F . Thus, ⃗F is a gradient ﬁeld and therefore path-independent. Calculations show
curl ⃗F = ⃗0 . The domain of ⃗F is all of 3-space minus the origin, and any closed curve in the
domain can be pulled to a point without leaving the domain. Thus, the curl test applies.
(b) Let C be the circle x2 + y2 = 1, z = 0 traversed counterclockwise when viewed from the
positive z-axis. Since z = 0 on the curve C, the vector ﬁeld ⃗G reduces to the vector ﬁeld in
Example 5 and is everywhere tangent to C and of magnitude 1, so

18.4 PATH-DEPENDENT VECTOR FIELDS AND GREEN’S THEOREM
993
Since the line integral around this closed curve is nonzero, ⃗G is path-dependent. Computations
show curl ⃗G = ⃗0 . However, the domain of ⃗G is all of 3-space minus the z-axis, and it does not
satisfy the curl test domain criterion. For example, the circle, C, is lassoed around the z-axis,
and cannot be pulled to a point without hitting the z-axis. Thus, the curl test does not apply.

constant along every such circle. Use Amp`ere’s Law to

always toward (or away from) a ﬁxed point O (the center)
and whose magnitude at a point P is a function only of
the distance from P to O. In two dimensions this means
that the vector ﬁeld has constant magnitude on circles
centered at O. The gravitational and electrical ﬁelds of

1. Conservation of Energy
(a) A particle moves with position vector ⃗r (t) = x(t)⃗i + y(t)⃗j + z(t)⃗k . Let ⃗v (t) and ⃗a (t)
be its velocity and acceleration vectors. Show that

d
dt∥⃗v (t)∥2 = ⃗a (t) · ⃗v (t).
(b) We now derive the principle of Conservation of Energy. The kinetic energy of a particle of
mass m moving with speed v is (1/2)mv2. Suppose the particle has potential energy f(⃗r )
at the position ⃗r due to a force ﬁeld ⃗F = −∇f. If the particle moves with position vector
⃗r (t) and velocity ⃗v (t), then the Conservation of Energy principle says that
Total energy = Kinetic energy + Potential energy = 1
2m∥⃗v (t)∥2 + f(⃗r (t)) = Constant.
Let P and Q be two points in space and let C be a path from P to Q parameterized by ⃗r (t)
for t0 ≤t ≤t1, where ⃗r (t0) = P and ⃗r (t1) = Q.
(i) Using part (a) and Newton’s law ⃗F = m⃗a , show
Work done by ⃗F
as particle moves along C

(ii) Use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for Line Integrals to show that
Work done by ⃗F
as particle moves along C
= Potential energy at P −Potential energy at Q.
(iii) Use parts (a) and (b) to show that the total energy at P is the same as at Q.
This problem explains why force vector ﬁelds which are path-independent are usually called
conservative (force) vector ﬁelds.
2. Planimeters
A planimeter is a mechanical device that exploits Green’s Theorem to ﬁnd the area of a planar
region by tracing out its boundary.
A linear planimeter is a rod with one end, the foot, that moves along a straight track as
a wheel at the other end rolls and slides along a curve being traced. The rod acts as an axle
for the wheel so that the wheel rolls without sliding for motion perpendicular to the rod, and
slides without rolling for motion parallel to the rod. The wheel vector is deﬁned by rotating the
displacement vector from wheel to foot clockwise 90◦. For motion in a direction making an
angle θ with the wheel vector, the ratio of roll to distance traveled is cos θ. (This counts rolling
as positive for one direction of rotation and negative for the other.) A meter on the planimeter
measures the amount the wheel rolls. When the user has ﬁnished tracing out a closed curve, the
total roll of the wheel determines the area of the enclosed region. In Figure 18.65 the foot of a
planimeter of length L slides up and down the x-axis as the wheel moves along C from P to Q.
The key fact that makes this work is that the planimeter computes the line integral of the
vector ﬁeld of unit vectors ⃗F in the direction of the wheel vector along the oriented curve C:

C
⃗F · d⃗r = Total roll of wheel.
To see this, divide C into n small, almost straight pieces along which ⃗F has approximately
constant direction. Each piece can be represented by a displacement vector Δ⃗r i = ⃗r i+1 −⃗r i,

PROJECTS FOR CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
1003
and ⃗F (⃗r i) is the unit vector in the direction of the wheel vector at the point of C with position
vector ⃗r i. We have
⃗F (⃗r i)·Δ⃗r i = ∥⃗F (⃗r i)∥∥Δ⃗r i∥cos θi ≈1·(Length of ith piece of C)·cos θi ≈Roll on ith piece of C.
Summing over all the pieces and taking the limit as ∥Δ⃗r i∥→0 gives the result.
In the problems, we ﬁnd a formula for ⃗F and use it to show how area is computed.

3. Amp`ere’s Law

through a surface to the magnetic ﬁeld around the boundary, C, of the surface. The law says
that

C
⃗B · d⃗r = kI,

The orientation of C is given by the right-hand rule: if the ﬁngers of your right hand lie against
the surface and curl in the direction of the oriented curve C, then your thumb points in the
direction of positive current.

is centered on and perpendicular to the z-axis. The direction of ⃗B is tangent to such circles.

(b) A torus is a doughnut-shaped surface obtained by rotating around the z-axis the circle
(x−β)2 +z2 = α2 of radius α and center (β, 0, 0), where 0 < α < β. A toroidal solenoid
is constructed by wrapping a thin wire a large number, say N, times around the torus.
Experiments show that if a constant current I ﬂows though the wire, then the magnitude
of the magnetic ﬁeld is constant on circles inside the torus which are centered on and
perpendicular to the z-axis. The direction of ⃗B is tangent to such circles. Explain why, at
all points inside the torus,
∥⃗B ∥= aNI
2πr ,
and ∥⃗B ∥= 0 otherwise. [Hint: Apply Amp`ere’s Law to a suitably chosen surface S with
boundary curve C. What is the net current passing through S?]
4. Conservative Forces, Friction, and Gravity
The work done by a conservative force on an object does not depend on the path taken but only
on the endpoints—in other words, the vector ﬁeld representing the force is path-independent.
Only for a conservative force is the work done stored as energy; for a non-conservative force,
the work may be dissipated.
(a) The frictional drag force ⃗F on an airplane ﬂying through the air with velocity ⃗v is given
by
⃗F = −c||⃗v ||⃗v .
The constant c is positive and depends on the shape of the airplane. One airplane takes off
from an airport located at the point (2, 0, 0) and follows the path
⃗r (t) = (2 cos t)⃗ı + (2 sin t)⃗j + 3t⃗k ,

THE IDEA OF A FLUX INTEGRAL
Flow Through a Surface
Imagine water ﬂowing through a ﬁshing net stretched across a stream. Suppose we want to measure
the ﬂow rate of water through the net, that is, the volume of ﬂuid that passes through the surface per
unit time.
Example 1
A ﬂat square surface of area A, in m2, is immersed in a ﬂuid. The ﬂuid ﬂows with constant velocity
⃗v , in m/sec, perpendicular to the square. Write an expression for the rate of ﬂow in m3/sec.
⃗v

A
Figure 19.1: Fluid ﬂowing perpendicular
to a surface
Solution
In one second a given particle of water moves a distance of ∥⃗v ∥in the direction perpendicular to the
square. Thus, the entire body of water moving through the square in one second is a box of length
∥⃗v ∥and cross-sectional area A. So the box has volume ∥⃗v ∥A m3, and
Flow rate = ∥⃗v ∥A m3/sec.
This ﬂow rate is called the ﬂux of the ﬂuid through the surface. We can also compute the ﬂux
of vector ﬁelds, such as electric and magnetic ﬁelds, where no ﬂow is actually taking place. If the
vector ﬁeld is constant and perpendicular to the surface, and if the surface is ﬂat, as in Example 1,
the ﬂux is obtained by multiplying the speed by the area.
Next we ﬁnd the ﬂux of a constant vector ﬁeld through a ﬂat surface that is not perpendicular
to the vector ﬁeld, using a dot product. In general, we break a surface into small pieces which are
approximately ﬂat and where the vector ﬁeld is approximately constant, leading to a ﬂux integral.
Orientation of a Surface
Before computing the ﬂux of a vector ﬁeld through a surface, we need to decide which direction of
ﬂow through the surface is the positive direction; this is described as choosing an orientation.1
At each point on a smooth surface there are two unit normals, one in each direction. Choosing
an orientation means picking one of these normals at every point of the surface in a contin-
uous way. The unit normal vector in the direction of the orientation is denoted by ⃗n . For a
closed surface (that is, the boundary of a solid region), we choose the outward orientation
unless otherwise speciﬁed.
We say the ﬂux through a piece of surface is positive if the ﬂow is in the direction of the
orientation and negative if it is in the opposite direction. (See Figure 19.2.)
1Although we will not study them, there are a few surfaces for which this cannot be done. See page 1012.

with area A and orientation ⃗n
The Area Vector
The ﬂux through a ﬂat surface depends both on the area of the surface and its orientation. Thus, it
is useful to represent its area by a vector as shown in Figure 19.3.
The area vector of a ﬂat, oriented surface is a vector ⃗A such that
• The magnitude of ⃗A is the area of the surface.
• The direction of ⃗A is the direction of the orientation vector ⃗n .
The Flux of a Constant Vector Field Through a Flat Surface
Suppose the velocity vector ﬁeld, ⃗v , of a ﬂuid is constant and ⃗A is the area vector of a ﬂat surface.
The ﬂux through this surface is the volume of ﬂuid that ﬂows through in one unit of time. The
skewed box in Figure 19.4 has cross-sectional area ∥⃗A ∥and height ∥⃗v ∥cosθ, so its volume is
(∥⃗v ∥cosθ) ∥⃗A ∥= ⃗v · ⃗A . Thus, we have the following result:
If ⃗v is constant and ⃗A is the area vector of a ﬂat surface, then
Flux through surface = ⃗v · ⃗A .

Example 2
Water is ﬂowing down a cylindrical pipe 2 cm in radius with a velocity of 3 cm/sec. Find the ﬂux of
the velocity vector ﬁeld through the ellipse-shaped region shown in Figure 19.5. The normal to the
ellipse makes an angle of θ with the direction of ﬂow and the area of the ellipse is 4π/(cos θ) cm2.

Chapter Nineteen FLUX INTEGRALS AND DIVERGENCE
Solution
There are two ways to approach this problem. One is to use the formula we just derived, which gives
Flux through ellipse = ⃗v · ⃗A = ∥⃗v ∥∥⃗A ∥cos θ = 3(Area of ellipse) cos θ
= 3
 4π
cos θ

cos θ = 12π cm3/sec.
The second way is to notice that the ﬂux through the ellipse is equal to the ﬂux through the
circle perpendicular to the pipe in Figure 19.5. Since the ﬂux is the rate at which water is ﬂowing
down the pipe, we have
Flux through circle =

(π22 cm2) = 12π cm3/sec.
The Flux Integral
If the vector ﬁeld, ⃗F , is not constant or the surface, S, is not ﬂat, we divide the surface into a
patchwork of small, almost ﬂat pieces. (See Figure 19.6.) For a particular patch with area ΔA, we
pick a unit orientation vector ⃗n at a point on the patch and deﬁne the area vector of the patch, Δ ⃗A ,
as
Δ ⃗A = ⃗n ΔA.
(See Figure 19.7.) If the patches are small enough, we can assume that ⃗F is approximately constant
on each piece. Then we know that
Flux through patch ≈⃗F · Δ ⃗A ,
so, adding the ﬂuxes through all the small pieces, we have
Flux through whole surface ≈
 ⃗F · Δ ⃗A ,
As each patch becomes smaller and ∥Δ ⃗A ∥→0, the approximation gets better and we get
Flux through S =
lim
∥Δ ⃗A ∥→0
 ⃗F · Δ ⃗A .
Thus, provided the limit exists, we make the following deﬁnition:
The ﬂux integral of the vector ﬁeld ⃗F through the oriented surface S is

S
⃗F · d ⃗A =
lim
∥Δ ⃗A ∥→0
 ⃗F · Δ ⃗A .
If S is a closed surface oriented outward, we describe the ﬂux through S as the ﬂux out of S.

19.1 THE IDEA OF A FLUX INTEGRAL
1009
In computing a ﬂux integral, we have to divide the surface up in a reasonable way, or the limit
might not exist. In practice this problem seldom arises; however, one way to avoid it is to deﬁne ﬂux
integrals by the method used to compute them shown in Section 21.3.
Flux and Fluid Flow
If ⃗v is the velocity vector ﬁeld of a ﬂuid, we have

area ∥Δ ⃗A ∥= ΔxΔz
Solution
Consider a small rectangular patch with area vector Δ ⃗A in S, with sides Δx and Δz so that
∥Δ ⃗A ∥= Δx Δz. Since Δ ⃗A points in the ⃗j direction, we have Δ ⃗A = ⃗j ΔxΔz. (See Fig-
ure 19.10.)
At the point (x, 0, z) in S, substituting y = 0 into ⃗B gives ⃗B (x, 0, z) = (1/x)⃗j . Thus, we
have
Flux through small patch ≈⃗B · Δ ⃗A =

Example 4
Each of the vector ﬁelds in Figure 19.11 consists entirely of vectors parallel to the xy-plane, and is
constant in the z direction (that is, the vector ﬁeld looks the same in any plane parallel to the xy-
plane). For each one, say whether you expect the ﬂux through a closed surface surroundingthe origin
to be positive, negative, or zero. In part (a) the surface is a closed cube with faces perpendicular to
the axes; in parts (b) and (c) the surface is a closed cylinder. In each case we choose the outward
orientation. (See Figure 19.12.)

Figure 19.12: The closed cube and closed cylinder, both oriented outward
Solution
(a) Since the vector ﬁeld appears to be parallel to the faces of the cube which are perpendicular to
the y- and z-axes, we expect the ﬂux through these faces to be zero. The ﬂuxes through the two
faces perpendicular to the x-axis appear to be equal in magnitude and opposite in sign, so we
expect the net ﬂux to be zero.
(b) Since the top and bottom of the cylinder are parallel to the ﬂow, the ﬂux through them is zero.
On the curved surface of the cylinder, ⃗v and Δ ⃗A appear to be everywhere parallel and in the
same direction, so we expect each term ⃗v · Δ ⃗A to be positive, and therefore the ﬂux integral

S ⃗v · d ⃗A to be positive.
(c) As in part (b), the ﬂux through the top and bottom of the cylinder is zero. In this case ⃗v and Δ ⃗A
are not parallel on the round surface of the cylinder, but since the ﬂuid appears to be ﬂowing
inward as well as swirling, we expect each term ⃗v · Δ ⃗A to be negative, and therefore the ﬂux
integral to be negative.

For a small patch of surface ΔS with unit normal ⃗n and area ΔA, the area vector is Δ ⃗A = ⃗n ΔA.
The next example shows how we can use this relationship to compute a ﬂux integral.

An electric charge q is placed at the origin in 3-space. The resulting electric ﬁeld ⃗E (⃗r ) at the point
with position vector ⃗r is given by
⃗E (⃗r ) = q

⃗r ̸= ⃗0 .

Figure 19.13: Flux of ⃗E = q⃗r /∥⃗r ∥3 through the surface of a sphere of radius R centered at the origin
Solution
This vector ﬁeld points radially outward from the origin in the same direction as ⃗n . Thus, since ⃗n
is a unit vector,
⃗E · Δ ⃗A = ⃗E · ⃗n ΔA = ∥⃗E ∥ΔA.
On the sphere, ∥⃗E ∥= q/R2, so

The last sum approximates the surface area of the sphere. In the limit as the subdivisions get ﬁner
we have

Thus, the ﬂux is given by


ΔA = q
R2 · (Surface area of sphere) = q
R2 (4πR2) = 4πq.
This result is known as Gauss’s law.
To compute a ﬂux with an integral instead of Riemann sums, we often write d ⃗A = ⃗n dA, as in
the next example.
Example 6
Suppose S is the surface of the cube bounded by the six planes x = ±1, y = ±1, and z = ±1.
Compute the ﬂux of the electric ﬁeld ⃗E of the previous example outward through S.
Solution
It is enough to compute the ﬂux of ⃗E through a single face, say the top face S1 deﬁned by z = 1,
where −1 ≤x ≤1 and −1 ≤y ≤1. By symmetry, the ﬂux of ⃗E through the other ﬁve faces of S
must be the same.
On the top face, S1, we have d ⃗A = ⃗n dA = ⃗k dx dy and
⃗E (x, y, 1) = q
x⃗i + y⃗j + ⃗k
(x2 + y2 + 1)3/2 .
The corresponding ﬂux integral is given by

Thus,
Total ﬂux of ⃗E out of cube =

⃗E · d ⃗A ≈6(2.0944q) = 12.5664q.

Chapter Nineteen FLUX INTEGRALS AND DIVERGENCE
Example 5 on page 1010 showed that the ﬂux of ⃗E through a sphere of radius R centered at
the origin is 4πq. Since 4π ≈12.5664, Example 6 suggests that
Total ﬂux of ⃗E out of cube = 4πq.
By computing the ﬂux integral in Example 6 exactly, it is possible to verify that the ﬂux of ⃗E
through the cube and the sphere are exactly equal. When we encounter the Divergence Theorem in
Chapter 20 we will see why this is so.
Notes on Orientation
Two difﬁculties can occur in choosing an orientation. The ﬁrst is that if the surface is not smooth,
it may not have a normal vector at every point. For example, a cube does not have a normal vector
along its edges. When we have a surface, such as a cube, which is made of a ﬁnite number of smooth
pieces, we choose an orientation for each piece separately. The best way to do this is usually clear.
For example, on the cube we choose the outward orientation on each face. (See Figure 19.14.)

The second difﬁculty is that there are some surfaces which cannot be oriented at all, such as the
M¨obius strip in Figure 19.15.

FLUX INTEGRALS FOR GRAPHS, CYLINDERS, AND SPHERES
In Section 19.1 we computed ﬂux integrals in certain simple cases. In this section we see how to
compute ﬂux through surfaces that are graphs of functions, through cylinders, and through spheres.
Flux of a Vector Field Through the Graph of z = f(x, y)
Suppose S is the graph of the differentiable function z = f(x, y), oriented upward, and that ⃗F is
a smooth vector ﬁeld. In Section 19.1 we subdivided the surface into small pieces with area vector
Δ ⃗A and deﬁned the ﬂux of ⃗F through S as follows:

How do we divide S into small pieces? One way is to use the cross-sections of f with x or y
constant and take the patches in a wire frame representation of the surface. So we must calculate the
area vector of one of these patches, which is approximately a parallelogram.
The Area Vector of a Coordinate Patch
According to the geometric deﬁnition of the cross product on page 745, the vector ⃗v × ⃗w has
magnitude equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by ⃗v and ⃗w and direction perpendicular
to this parallelogram and determined by the right-hand rule. Thus, we have
Area vector of parallelogram = ⃗A = ⃗v × ⃗w .

Figure 19.19: Parallelogram-shaped patch in
the tangent plane to the surface
Consider the patch of surface above the rectangular region with sides Δx and Δy in the xy-
plane shown in Figure 19.18. We approximate the area vector, Δ ⃗A , of this patch by the area vector
of the corresponding patch on the tangent plane to the surface. See Figure 19.19. This patch is the
parallelogram determined by the vectors ⃗v x and ⃗v y, so its area vector is given by
Δ ⃗A ≈⃗v x × ⃗v y.
To ﬁnd ⃗v x and ⃗v y, notice that a point on the surface has position vector ⃗r = x⃗i + y⃗j + f(x, y)⃗k .
Thus, a cross-section of S with y constant has tangent vector
⃗r x = ∂⃗r
∂x =⃗i + fx⃗k ,
and a cross-section with x constant has tangent vector
⃗r y = ∂⃗r
∂y = ⃗j + fy⃗k .
The vectors ⃗r x and ⃗v x are parallel because they are both tangent to the surface and parallel
to the xz-plane. Since the x-component of ⃗r x is⃗i and the x-component of ⃗v x is (Δx)⃗i , we have
⃗v x = (Δx)⃗r x. Similarly, we have ⃗v y = (Δy)⃗r y. So the upward-pointing area vector of the
parallelogram is
Δ ⃗A ≈⃗v x × ⃗v y = (⃗r x × ⃗r y) Δx Δy =

−fx⃗i −fy⃗j + ⃗k
	
Δx Δy.
This is our approximation for the area vector Δ ⃗A on the surface. Replacing Δ ⃗A , Δx, and Δy by
d ⃗A , dx and dy, we write
d ⃗A =

−fx⃗i −fy⃗j + ⃗k
	
dx dy.

The Flux of ⃗F Through a Surface Given by a Graph of z = f(x, y)

Figure 19.20: The vector ﬁeld ⃗F = z⃗k on the rectangular surface S
Solution
We ﬁnd the equation for the plane S in the form z = f(x, y). Since f is linear, with x-slope equal
to 0 and y-slope equal to 3, and f(0, 0) = 0, we have
z = f(x, y) = 0 + 0x + 3y = 3y.
Thus, we have
d ⃗A = (−fx⃗i −fy⃗j + ⃗k ) dx dy = (0⃗i −3⃗j + ⃗k ) dx dy = (−3⃗j + ⃗k ) dx dy.
The ﬂux integral is therefore

Flux of a Vector Field Through a Cylindrical Surface
Consider the cylinder of radius R centered on the z-axis illustrated in Figure 19.21 and oriented
away from the z-axis. The coordinate patch in Figure 19.22 has surface area given by
ΔA ≈R Δθ Δz.
The outward unit normal ⃗n points in the direction of x⃗i + y⃗j , so
⃗n =
x⃗i + y⃗j
∥x⃗i + y⃗j ∥
= R cos θ⃗i + R sin θ⃗j
R

Therefore, the area vector of the coordinate patch is approximated by

Flux of a Vector Field Through a Spherical Surface
Consider the piece of the sphere of radius R centered at the origin, oriented outward, as illustrated
in Figure 19.24. The coordinate patch in Figure 19.24 has surface area given by
ΔA ≈R2 sin φ Δφ Δθ.
The outward unit normal ⃗n points in the direction of ⃗r = x⃗i + y⃗j + z⃗k , so
⃗n =

∥⃗r ∥= sin φ cos θ⃗i + sin φ sin θ⃗j + cos φ⃗k .
Therefore, the area vector of the coordinate patch is approximated by

THE DIVERGENCE OF A VECTOR FIELD
Imagine that the vector ﬁelds in Figures 19.29 and 19.30 are velocity vector ﬁelds describing the
ﬂow of a ﬂuid.2 Figure 19.29 suggests outﬂow from the origin; for example, it could represent the
expanding cloud of matter in the big-bang theory of the origin of the universe. We say that the origin
is a source. Figure 19.30 suggests ﬂow into the origin; in this case we say that the origin is a sink.
In this section we use the ﬂux out of a closed surface surrounding a point to measure the outﬂow
per unit volume there, also called the divergence, or ﬂux density.

Definition of Divergence
To measure the outﬂow per unit volume of a vector ﬁeld at a point, we calculate the ﬂux out of a
small sphere centered at the point, divide by the volume enclosed by the sphere, then take the limit
of this ﬂux-to-volume ratio as the sphere contracts around the point.
Geometric Deﬁnition of Divergence
The divergence, or ﬂux density, of a smooth vector ﬁeld ⃗F , written div ⃗F , is a scalar-valued
function deﬁned by
div ⃗F (x, y, z) =
lim
Volume→0

S ⃗F · d ⃗A
Volume of S .
Here S is a sphere centered at (x, y, z), oriented outward, that contracts down to (x, y, z) in
the limit.
The limit can be computed using other shapes as well, such as the cubes in Example 2.
Cartesian Coordinate Deﬁnition of Divergence
If ⃗F = F1⃗i + F2⃗j + F3⃗k , then
div ⃗F = ∂F1
∂x + ∂F2
∂y + ∂F3
∂z .
The dot product formula gives an easy way to remember the Cartesian coordinate deﬁnition,
and suggests another common notation for div ⃗F , namely ∇· ⃗F . Using ∇= ∂
∂x
⃗i + ∂
∂y
⃗j + ∂
∂z
⃗k ,
we can write
div ⃗F = ∇· ⃗F =
 ∂
∂x
⃗i + ∂
∂y
⃗j + ∂
∂z
⃗k

· (F1⃗i + F2⃗j + F3⃗k ) = ∂F1
∂x + ∂F2
∂y + ∂F3
∂z .
2Although not all vector ﬁelds represent physically realistic ﬂuid ﬂows, it is useful to think of them in this way.

Example 1
Calculate the divergence of ⃗F (⃗r ) = ⃗r at the origin
(a) Using the geometric deﬁnition.
(b) Using the Cartesian coordinate deﬁnition.
Solution
(a) Using the method of Example 5 on page 1010, you can calculate the ﬂux of ⃗F out of the sphere
of radius a, centered at the origin; it is 4πa3. So we have
div ⃗F (0, 0, 0) = lim
a→0

3πa3 = lim
a→0 3 = 3.
(b) In Cartesian coordinates, ⃗F (x, y, z) = x⃗i + y⃗j + z⃗k , so
div ⃗F = ∂
∂x(x) + ∂
∂y(y) + ∂
∂z (z) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
The next example shows that the divergence can be negative if there is net inﬂow to a point.
Example 2
(a) Using the geometric deﬁnition, ﬁnd the divergence of ⃗v = −x⃗i at: (i) (0, 0, 0) (ii) (2, 2, 0).
(b) Conﬁrm that the coordinate deﬁnition gives the same results.
Solution
(a)
(i) The vector ﬁeld ⃗v = −x⃗i is parallel to the x-axis and is shown in the xy-plane in Fig-
ure 19.31. To compute the ﬂux density at (0, 0, 0), we use a cube S1, centered at the origin
with edges parallel to the axes, of length 2c. Then the ﬂux through the faces perpendicular
to the y- and z-axes is zero (because the vector ﬁeld is parallel to these faces). On the faces
perpendicular to the x-axis, the vector ﬁeld and the outward normal are parallel but point
in opposite directions. On the face at x = c, where ⃗v = −c⃗i and Δ ⃗A = ∥⃗A ∥⃗i , we have
⃗v · Δ ⃗A = −c ∥Δ ⃗A ∥.
On the face at x = −c, where ⃗v = c⃗i and Δ ⃗A = −∥⃗A ∥⃗i , the dot product is still negative:
⃗v · Δ ⃗A = −c ∥Δ ⃗A ∥.
Therefore, the ﬂux through the cube is given by

S1
⃗v · d ⃗A =

Face x=−c
⃗v · d ⃗A +

Face x=c
⃗v · d ⃗A
= −c · Area of one face + (−c) · Area of other face = −2c(2c)2 = −8c3.
Thus,
div⃗v (0, 0, 0) =
lim
Volume→0

S
⃗v · d ⃗A
Volume of cube = lim
c→0
−8c3
(2c)3

= −1.
Since the vector ﬁeld points inward toward the yz-plane, it makes sense that the divergence
is negative at the origin.
(ii) Take S2 to be a cube as before, but centered this time at the point (2, 2, 0). See Figure 19.31.
As before, the ﬂux through the faces perpendicular to the y- and z-axes is zero. On the face
at x = 2 + c,
⃗v · Δ ⃗A = −(2 + c) ∥Δ ⃗A ∥.
On the face at x = 2 −c with outward normal, the dot product is positive, and
⃗v · Δ ⃗A = (2 −c) ∥Δ ⃗A ∥.

19.3 THE DIVERGENCE OF A VECTOR FIELD
1027
Therefore, the ﬂux through the cube is given by

S2
⃗v · d ⃗A =

Face x=2−c
⃗v · d ⃗A +

Face x=2+c
⃗v · d ⃗A
= (2 −c) · Area of one face −(2 + c) · Area of other face = −2c(2c)2 = −8c3.
Then, as before,
div⃗v (2, 2, 0) =
lim
Volume→0

S ⃗v · d ⃗A
Volume of cube = lim
c→0
−8c3
(2c)3

= −1.
Although the vector ﬁeld is ﬂowing away from the point (2, 2, 0) on the left, this outﬂow
is smaller in magnitude than the inﬂow on the right, so the net outﬂow is negative.
(b) Since ⃗v = −x⃗i + 0⃗j + 0⃗k , the formula gives
div⃗v = ∂
∂x(−x) + ∂
∂y(0) + ∂
∂z (0) = −1 + 0 + 0 = −1.

Why Do the Two Definitions of Divergence Give the Same Result?
The geometric deﬁnition deﬁnes div ⃗F as the ﬂux density of ⃗F . To see why the coordinate deﬁ-
nition is also the ﬂux density, imagine computing the ﬂux out of a small box-shaped surface S at
(x0, y0, z0), with sides of length Δx, Δy, and Δz parallel to the axes. On S1 (the back face of the
box shown in Figure 19.32, where x = x0), the outward normal is in the negative x-direction, so
d ⃗A = −dy dz⃗i . Assuming ⃗F is approximately constant on S1, we have

S1
⃗F · d ⃗A =

S1
⃗F · (−⃗i ) dy dz ≈−F1(x0, y0, z0)

S1
dy dz
= −F1(x0, y0, z0) · Area of S1 = −F1(x0, y0, z0) Δy Δz.
On S2, the face where x = x0 + Δx, the outward normal points in the positive x-direction, so
d ⃗A = dy dz⃗i . Therefore,

S2
⃗F · d ⃗A =

S2
⃗F ·⃗i dy dz ≈F1(x0 + Δx, y0, z0)

S2
dy dz
= F1(x0 + Δx, y0, z0) · Area of S2 = F1(x0 + Δx, y0, z0) Δy Δz.

By an analogous argument, the contribution to the ﬂux from S3 and S4 (the surfaces perpendicular
to the y-axis) is approximately

∂y Δx Δy Δz,
and the contribution to the ﬂux from S5 and S6 is approximately

Thus, adding these contributions, we have
Total ﬂux through S ≈∂F1
∂x Δx Δy Δz + ∂F2

Since the volume of the box is Δx Δy Δz, the ﬂux density is

Divergence-Free Vector Fields
A vector ﬁeld ⃗F is said to be divergence free or solenoidal if div⃗F
= 0 everywhere that ⃗F is
deﬁned.

(b) The divergence is zero when p = 3, so ⃗F (⃗r ) = ⃗r /∥⃗r ∥3 is a divergence-free vector ﬁeld.
Notice that the divergence is zero even though the vectors point outward from the origin.
Magnetic Fields
An important class of divergence-free vector ﬁelds is the magnetic ﬁelds. One of Maxwell’s Laws
of Electromagnetism is that the magnetic ﬁeld ⃗B satisﬁes
div ⃗B = 0.
Example 4
An inﬁnitesimal current loop, similar to that shown in Figure 19.34, is called a magnetic dipole. Its
magnitude is described by a constant vector ⃗μ , called the dipole moment. The magnetic ﬁeld due to
a magnetic dipole with moment ⃗μ is

To show that div ⃗B = 0 we can use the following version of the product rule for the divergence: if

div(g ⃗F ) = (grad g) · ⃗F + g div ⃗F .

Problems 30–31 involve electric ﬁelds. Electric charge pro-
duces a vector ﬁeld ⃗E , called the electric ﬁeld, which rep-
resents the force on a unit positive charge placed at the
point. Two positive or two negative charges repel one another,
whereas two charges of opposite sign attract one another. The
divergence of ⃗E is proportional to the density of the electric
charge (that is, the charge per unit volume), with a positive
constant of proportionality.

55 miles/hour in the next 1000 feet, after which it moves
steadily at 55 miles/hour.

19.3 THE DIVERGENCE OF A VECTOR FIELD
1033
41. Let ⃗F (x, y) = u(x, y)⃗i + v(x, y)⃗j be a 2-dimensional
vector ﬁeld. Let F(x, y) be the magnitude of ⃗F and let
θ(x, y) be the angle of ⃗F with the positive x-axis at the
point (x, y), so that u = F cos θ and v = F sin θ. Let
⃗T be the unit vector in the direction of ⃗F , and let ⃗N be
the unit vector in the direction of ⃗k × ⃗F , perpendicular
to ⃗F . Show that
div ⃗F = Fθ ⃗
N + F⃗T .
This problem shows that the divergence of the vector
ﬁeld ⃗F is the sum of two terms. The ﬁrst term, Fθ ⃗
N ,
is due to changes in the direction of ⃗F perpendicular to
the ﬂow lines, so it reﬂects the extent to which ﬂow lines
of ⃗F fail to be parallel. The second term, F⃗T , is due to
changes in the magnitude of ⃗F along ﬂow lines of ⃗F .
42. In Problem 64 on page 1015 it was shown that the rate
of heat loss from a volume V in a region of non-uniform
temperature equals k 

stant, S is the surface bounding V , and T (x, y, z) is the
temperature at the point (x, y, z) in space. By taking the
limit as V contracts to a point, show that, at that point,

depend on time, t.

the form ⃗v = 

THE DIVERGENCE THEOREM
The Divergence Theorem is a multivariable analogue of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus;
it says that the integral of the ﬂux density over a solid region equals the ﬂux integral through the
boundary of the region.
The Boundary of a Solid Region
A solid region is an open region in 3-space. The boundary of a solid region may be thought of as the
skin between the interior of the region and the space around it. For example, the boundary of a solid
ball is a spherical surface, the boundary of a solid cube is its six faces, and the boundary of a solid
cylinder is a tube sealed at both ends by disks. (See Figure 19.37). A surface which is the boundary
of a solid region is called a closed surface.
W = Ball
S = Sphere
W =Solid Cylinder
S = Tube and two disks
W = Solid cube
S = 6 square faces
Figure 19.37: Several solid regions and their boundaries
Calculating the Flux from the Flux Density
Consider a solid region W in 3-space whose boundary is the closed surface S. There are two ways
to ﬁnd the total ﬂux of a vector ﬁeld ⃗F out of W. One is to calculate the ﬂux of ⃗F through S:
Flux out of W =

S
⃗F · d ⃗A .
Another way is to use div ⃗F , which gives the ﬂux density at any point in W. We subdivide W
into small boxes, as shown in Figure 19.38. Then, for a small box of volume ΔV ,
Flux out of box ≈Flux density · Volume = div ⃗F ΔV.
What happens when we add the ﬂuxes out of all the boxes? Consider two adjacent boxes, as
shown in Figure 19.39. The ﬂux through the shared wall is counted twice, once out of the box on
each side. When we add the ﬂuxes, these two contributions cancel, so we get the ﬂux out of the solid
region formed by joining the two boxes. Continuing in this way, we ﬁnd that

19.4 THE DIVERGENCE THEOREM
1035
Flux out of W =

Flux out of small boxes ≈

div ⃗F ΔV.
We have approximated the ﬂux by a Riemann sum. As the subdivision gets ﬁner, the sum approaches
an integral, so
Flux out of W =

W
div ⃗F dV.
We have calculated the ﬂux in two ways, as a ﬂux integral and as a volume integral. Therefore,
these two integrals must be equal. This result holds even if W is not a rectangular solid. Thus, we
have the following result.3
Theorem 19.1: The Divergence Theorem
If W is a solid region whose boundary S is a piecewise smooth surface, and if ⃗F is a smooth
vector ﬁeld on an open region containing W and S, then

S
⃗F · d ⃗A =

W
div ⃗F dV,
where S is given the outward orientation.
Example 1
Use the Divergence Theorem to calculate the ﬂux of the vector ﬁeld ⃗F (⃗r ) = ⃗r through the sphere
of radius a centered at the origin.
Solution
In Example 5 on page 1010 we computed the ﬂux using the deﬁnition of a ﬂux integral, giving

S
⃗r · d ⃗A = 4πa3.
Now we use div ⃗F = div(x⃗i + y⃗j + z⃗k ) = 3 and the Divergence Theorem:

S
⃗r · d ⃗A =

W
div ⃗F dV =

W
3 dV = 3 · 4
3πa3 = 4πa3.
Example 2
Use the Divergence Theorem to calculate the ﬂux of the vector ﬁeld
⃗F (x, y, z) = (x2 + y2)⃗i + (y2 + z2)⃗j + (x2 + z2)⃗k
through the cube in Figure 19.40.

Figure 19.40
Solution
The divergence of ⃗F is div ⃗F = 2x + 2y + 2z. Since div ⃗F is positive everywhere in the ﬁrst
quadrant, the ﬂux through S is positive. By the Divergence Theorem,
3A proof of the Divergence Theorem using the coordinate deﬁnition of the divergence can be found in the online supple-
ment at www.wiley.com/college/hughes-hallett.

The Divergence Theorem and Divergence-Free Vector Fields
An important application of the Divergence Theorem is the study of divergence-free vector ﬁelds.
Example 3
In Example 3 on page 1028 we saw that the following vector ﬁeld is divergence free:
⃗F (⃗r ) =
⃗r
∥⃗r ∥3 ,
⃗r ̸= ⃗0 .
Calculate

S ⃗F · d ⃗A , using the Divergence Theorem if possible, for the following surfaces:
(a) S1 is the sphere of radius a centered at the origin.
(b) S2 is the sphere of radius a centered at the point (2a, 0, 0).
Solution
(a) We cannot use the Divergence Theorem directly because ⃗F is not deﬁned everywhere inside
the sphere (it is not deﬁned at the origin). Since ⃗F points outward everywhere on S1, the ﬂux
out of S1 is positive. On S1,
⃗F · d ⃗A = ∥⃗F ∥dA = a
a3 dA,
so

S1
⃗F · d ⃗A = 1
a2

S1
dA = 1
a2 (Area of S1) = 1
a2 4πa2 = 4π.
Notice that the ﬂux is not zero, although div ⃗F is zero everywhere it is deﬁned.
(b) Suppose W is the solid region enclosed by S2. Since div ⃗F = 0 everywhere in W, we can use
the Divergence Theorem in this case, giving

S2
⃗F · d ⃗A =

W
div ⃗F dV =

W
0 dV = 0.
The Divergence Theorem applies to any solid region W and its boundary S, even in cases
where the boundary consists of two or more surfaces. For example, if W is the solid region between
the sphere S1 of radius 1 and the sphere S2 of radius 2, both centered at the same point, then
the boundary of W consists of both S1 and S2. The Divergence Theorem requires the outward
orientation, which on S2 points away from the center and on S1 points toward the center. (See
Figure 19.41.)

19.4 THE DIVERGENCE THEOREM
1037
Example 4
Let S1 be the sphere of radius 1 centered at the origin and let S2 be the ellipsoid x2 +y2+4z2 = 16,
both oriented outward. For
⃗F (⃗r ) =
⃗r
∥⃗r ∥3 ,
⃗r ̸= ⃗0 ,
show that

S1
⃗F · d ⃗A =

S2
⃗F · d ⃗A .
Solution
The ellipsoid contains the sphere; let W be the solid region between them. Since W does not contain
the origin, div ⃗F is deﬁned and equal to zero everywhere in W. Thus, if S is the boundary of W,
then

S
⃗F · d ⃗A =

W
div ⃗F dV = 0.
But S consists of S2 oriented outward and S1 oriented inward, so
0 =

S
⃗F · d ⃗A =

S2
⃗F · d ⃗A −

S1
⃗F · d ⃗A ,
and thus

S2
⃗F · d ⃗A =

S1
⃗F · d ⃗A .
In Example 3 we showed that

S1 ⃗F · d ⃗A = 4π, so

S2 ⃗F · d ⃗A = 4π also. Note that it would have
been more difﬁcult to compute the integral over the ellipsoid directly.
Electric Fields
The electric ﬁeld produced by a positive point charge q placed at the origin is
⃗E = q
⃗r
∥⃗r ∥3 .
Using Example 3, we see that the ﬂux of the electric ﬁeld through any sphere centered at the origin
is 4πq. In fact, using the idea of Example 4, we can show that the ﬂux of ⃗E through any closed
surface containing the origin is 4πq. See Problems 36 and 37 on page 1039. This is a special case of
Gauss’s Law, which states that the ﬂux of an electric ﬁeld through any closed surface is proportional
to the total charge enclosed by the surface. Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) also discovered the
Divergence Theorem, which is sometimes called Gauss’s Theorem.

where S1 is the sphere of radius 1 centered at the ori-
gin.
(b) Let S2 be the sphere of radius 2 centered at the ori-
gin; let S3 be the sphere of radius 3 centered at the
origin; let S4 be the box of side 6 centered at the
origin with edges parallel to the axes. Without cal-
culating them, arrange the following integrals in in-
creasing order:

S2


S3
⃗F · d ⃗A ,

S4
⃗F · d ⃗A .
32. Suppose div ⃗F = xyz2.

given div ⃗F , not ⃗F .]
(b) Using your answer to part (a), but no other informa-
tion about the vector ﬁeld ⃗F , estimate the ﬂux out of
a small box of side 0.2 centered at the point (1, 2, 1)
and with edges parallel to the axes.
(c) Without computing the vector ﬁeld ⃗F , calculate the
exact ﬂux out of the box.
33. Suppose div ⃗F = x2+y2+3. Find a surface S such that

S ⃗F · d ⃗A is negative, or explain why no such surface
exists.
34. As a result of radioactive decay, heat is generated uni-
formly throughout the interior of the earth at a rate of 30
watts per cubic kilometer. (A watt is a rate of heat pro-
duction.) The heat then ﬂows to the earth’s surface where
it is lost to space. Let ⃗F (x, y, z) denote the rate of ﬂow
of heat measured in watts per square kilometer. By def-
inition, the ﬂux of ⃗F across a surface is the quantity of
heat ﬂowing through the surface per unit of time.
(a) What is the value of div ⃗F ? Include units.
(b) Assume the heat ﬂows outward symmetrically. Ver-
ify that ⃗F = α⃗r , where ⃗r = x⃗i + y⃗j + z⃗k and α
is a suitable constant, satisﬁes the given conditions.
Find α.
(c) Let T (x, y, z) denote the temperature inside the
earth. Heat ﬂows according to the equation ⃗F
=
−k grad T , where k is a constant. Explain why this
makes sense physically.
(d) If T is in ◦C, then k = 30,000 watts/km◦C. Assum-
ing the earth is a sphere with radius 6400 km and
surface temperature 20◦C, what is the temperature
at the center?
35. If a surface S is submerged in an incompressible ﬂuid, a
force ⃗F is exerted on one side of the surface by the pres-
sure in the ﬂuid. If the z-axis is vertical, with the positive
direction upward and the ﬂuid level at z = 0, then the
component of force in the direction of a unit vector ⃗u is
given by the following:
⃗F · ⃗u = −

S
zδg⃗u · d ⃗A ,
where δ is the density of the ﬂuid (mass/volume), g is the
acceleration due to gravity, and the surface is oriented
away from the side on which the force is exerted. In this
problem we consider a totally submerged closed surface
enclosing a volume V . We are interested in the force of
the liquid on the external surface, so S is oriented inward.
Use the Divergence Theorem to show that:
(a) The force in the⃗i and ⃗j directions is zero.
(b) The force in the ⃗k direction is δgV , the weight of
the volume of ﬂuid with the same volume as V . This
is Archimedes’ Principle.
36. According to Coulomb’s Law, the electrostatic ﬁeld ⃗E at
the point ⃗r due to a charge q at the origin is given by
⃗E (⃗r ) = q
⃗r
∥⃗r ∥3 .
(a) Compute div ⃗E .
(b) Let Sa be the sphere of radius a centered at the ori-
gin and oriented outward. Show that the ﬂux of ⃗E
through Sa is 4πq.
(c) Could you have used the Divergence Theorem in
part (b)? Explain why or why not.
(d) Let S be an arbitrary, closed, outward-oriented sur-
face surrounding the origin. Show that the ﬂux of
⃗E through S is again 4πq. [Hint: Apply the Diver-
gence Theorem to the solid region lying between a
small sphere Sa and the surface S.]
37. According to Coulomb’s Law, the electric ﬁeld ⃗E at the
point ⃗r due to a charge q at the point ⃗r 0 is given by
⃗E (⃗r ) = q (⃗r −⃗r 0)
∥⃗r −⃗r 0∥3 .
Suppose S is a closed, outward-oriented surface and that
⃗r 0 does not lie on S. Use Problem 36 to show that

S
⃗E · d ⃗A =
 4πq
if q lies inside S,
0
if q lies outside S.

A vector ﬁeld is spherically symmetric about the origin if, on every sphere centered at the

ﬁeld that is spherically symmetric about the origin can be written in terms of the spherical

3. Gauss’s Law Applied to a Charged Wire and a Charged Sheet
Gauss’s Law states that the ﬂux of an electric ﬁeld through a closed surface, S, is proportional
to the quantity of charge, q, enclosed within S. That is,

S
⃗E · d ⃗A = kq.
In this project we use Gauss’s Law to calculate the electric ﬁeld of a uniformly charged wire in
part (a) and a ﬂat sheet of charge in part (b).
(a) Consider the electric ﬁeld due to an inﬁnitely long, straight, uniformly charged wire. (There
is no current running through the wire—all charges are ﬁxed.) Assuming that the wire is
inﬁnitely long means that we can assume that the electric ﬁeld is perpendicular to any
cylinder that has the wire as an axis and that the magnitude of the ﬁeld is constant on any
such cylinder. Denote by Er the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld due to the wire on a cylinder
of radius r. (See Figure 19.44.)
Imagine a closed surface S made up of two cylinders, one of radius a and one of
larger radius b, both coaxial with the wire, and the two washers that cap the ends. (See
Figure 19.45.) The outward orientation of S means that a normal on the outer cylinder
points away from the wire and a normal on the inner cylinder points toward the wire.
(i) Explain why the ﬂux of ⃗E , the electric ﬁeld, through the washers is 0.
(ii) Explain why Gauss’s Law implies that the ﬂux through the inner cylinder is the same
as the ﬂux through the outer cylinder. [Hint: The charge on the wire is not inside the
surface S].
(iii) Use part (ii) to show that Eb/Ea = a/b.
(iv) Explain why part (iii) shows that the strength of the ﬁeld due to an inﬁnitely long
uniformly charged wire is proportional to 1/r.

shows that the electric ﬁeld ⃗E is perpendicular to the sheet and has the same magnitude at
all points that are the same distance from the sheet. Use Gauss’s Law to explain why, on any
one side of the sheet, the electric ﬁeld is the same at all points in space off the sheet. [Hint:

(ii) What are the limits of the ﬂux

(b) Let T be the outward-oriented, closed cylinder of height 2H and radius R whose curved
side is given by x2+y2 = R2, −H ≤z ≤H, whose top is given by z = H, x2+y2 ≤R2,
and bottom by z = −H, x2 + y2 ≤R2. Use part (a) to show that the ﬂux of the electric
ﬁeld, ⃗E , through T is given by

T
⃗E · d ⃗A = 4πq.
Notice that this is Gauss’s Law. In particular, the ﬂux is independent of both the height, H,
and radius, R, of the cylinder.

THE CURL OF A VECTOR FIELD
The divergence is a scalar derivative which measures the outﬂow of a vector ﬁeld per unit volume.
Now we introduce a vector derivative, the curl, which measures the circulation of a vector ﬁeld.
Imagine holding the paddle-wheel in Figure 20.1 in the ﬂow shown by Figure 20.2. The speed at
which the paddle-wheel spins measures the strength of circulation. Notice that the angular velocity
depends on the direction in which the stick is pointing. If the stick is pointing horizontally the
paddle-wheel does not spin; if the stick is vertical, the paddle wheel spins.

Circulation Density
We measure the strength of the circulation using a closed curve. Suppose C is a circle with center
P = (x, y, z) in the plane perpendicular to ⃗n , traversed in the direction determined from ⃗n by the
right-hand rule. (See Figures 20.3 and 20.4.)

We make the following deﬁnition:
The circulation density of a smooth vector ﬁeld ⃗F at (x, y, z) around the direction of the
unit vector ⃗n is deﬁned, provided the limit exists, to be
circ⃗n ⃗F (x, y, z) =

The circle C is in the plane perpendicular to ⃗n and oriented by the right-hand rule.
We can use other closed curves for C, such as rectangles, that lie in a plane perpendicular to ⃗n
and include (x, y, z).
The circulation density determines the angular velocity of the paddle-wheel in Figure 20.1
provided you could make one sufﬁciently small and light and insert it without disturbing the ﬂow.

Example 1
Consider the vector ﬁeld ⃗F in Figure 20.2. Suppose that ⃗F is parallel to the xy-plane and that at a
distance r from the z-axis it has magnitude 2r. Calculate circ⃗n ⃗F at the origin for
(a)
⃗n = ⃗k
(b)
⃗n = −⃗k
(c)
⃗n =⃗i .
Solution
(a) Take a circle C of radius a in the xy-plane, centered at the origin, traversed in a direction
determined from ⃗k by the right hand rule. Then, since ⃗F is tangent to C everywhere and points
in the forward direction around C, we have
Circulation around C =

C
⃗F · d⃗r = ∥⃗F ∥· Circumference of C = 2a(2πa) = 4πa2.
Thus, the circulation density is
circ⃗k ⃗F = lim
a→0
Circulation around C
Area inside C

a→0

πa2 = 4.
(b) If ⃗n = −⃗k the circle is traversed in the opposite direction, so the line integral changes sign.
Thus,
circ−⃗k ⃗F = −4.
(c) The circulation around ⃗i is calculated using circles in the yz-plane. Since ⃗F is everywhere
perpendicular to such a circle C,

C
⃗F · d⃗r = 0.
Thus, we have

πa2 = 0.
Definition of the Curl
Example 1 shows that the circulation density of a vector ﬁeld can be positive, negative, or zero,
depending on the direction. We assume that there is one direction in which the circulation density is
greatest and deﬁne a single vector quantity that incorporates all these different circulation densities.
We give two deﬁnitions, one geometric and one algebraic, which turn out to lead to the same result.
Geometric Deﬁnition of Curl
The curl of a smooth vector ﬁeld ⃗F , written curl ⃗F , is the vector ﬁeld with the following
properties
• The direction of curl ⃗F (x, y, z) is the direction ⃗n for which circ⃗n ⃗F (x, y, z) is the
greatest.
• The magnitude of curl ⃗F (x, y, z) is the circulation density of ⃗F around that direction.
If the circulation density is zero around every direction, then we deﬁne the curl to be⃗0 .

Example 2
For each ﬁeld in Figure 20.5, use the sketch and the geometric deﬁnition to decide whether the curl
at the origin appears to point up, down, or to be the zero vector. Then check your answer using the
coordinate deﬁnition of curl. Note that the vector ﬁelds have no z-components and are independent
of z.

Solution
(a) This vector ﬁeld shows no rotation, and the circulation around any circle in the xy-plane cen-
tered at the origin appears to be zero, so we suspect that the circulation density around ⃗k is
zero. The coordinate deﬁnition of curl gives
curl ⃗F =

⃗k = ⃗0 .
(b) This vector ﬁeld appears to be rotating around the z-axis. By the right-hand rule, the circula-
tion density around ⃗k is negative, so we expect the z-component of the curl points down. The
coordinate deﬁnition gives
curl ⃗F =

∂y
∂z −∂(0)
∂x

⃗j +

⃗k = −2⃗k .
(c) At ﬁrst glance, you might expect this vector ﬁeld to have zero curl, as all the vectors are parallel
to the x-axis. However, if you ﬁnd the circulation around the curve C in Figure 20.6, the sides
contribute nothing (they are perpendicular to the vector ﬁeld), the bottom contributes a negative
quantity (the curve is in the opposite direction to the vector ﬁeld), and the top contributes a
larger positive quantity (the curve is in the same direction as the vector ﬁeld and the magnitude
of the vector ﬁeld is larger at the top than at the bottom). Thus, the circulation around C is
positive and hence we expect the curl to be nonzero and point up. The coordinate deﬁnition
gives
curl ⃗F =

⃗k = ⃗k .
Another way to see that the curl is nonzero in this case is to imagine the vector ﬁeld representing
the velocity of moving water. A boat sitting in the water tends to rotate, as the water moves faster
on one side than the other.

Example 3
A ﬂywheel is rotating with angular velocity ⃗ω and the velocity of a point P with position vector ⃗r
is given by ⃗v = ⃗ω × ⃗r . (See Figure 20.7.) Calculate curl⃗v .
Solution
If ⃗ω = ω1⃗i + ω2⃗j + ω3⃗k , using the determinant notation introduced in Section 13.4, we have
⃗v = ⃗ω × ⃗r =



The curl formula can also be written using a determinant:
curl⃗v =

∂y (ω2z −ω3y)

⃗k
= 2ω1⃗i + 2ω2⃗j + 2ω3⃗k = 2⃗ω .
Thus, as we would expect, curl⃗v is parallel to the axis of rotation of the ﬂywheel (namely, the
direction of ⃗ω ) and the magnitude of curl⃗v is larger the faster the ﬂywheel is rotating (that is, the
larger the magnitude of ⃗ω ).
Why Do the Two Definitions of Curl Give the Same Result?
Using Green’s Theorem in Cartesian coordinates, we can show that for curl ⃗F deﬁned in Cartesian
coordinates
curl ⃗F · ⃗n = circ⃗n ⃗F .
This shows that curl ⃗F deﬁned in Cartesian coordinates satisﬁes the geometric deﬁnition, since the
left-hand side takes its maximum value when ⃗n points in the same direction as curl ⃗F , and in that
case its value is ∥curl ⃗F ∥.
The following example justiﬁes this formula in a speciﬁc case.
Example 4
Use the deﬁnition of curl in Cartesian coordinates and Green’s Theorem to show that

curl ⃗F
	
· ⃗k = circ⃗k ⃗F .

1052
Chapter Twenty THE CURL AND STOKES’ THEOREM
Solution
Using the deﬁnition of curl in Cartesian coordinates, the left-hand side of the formula is

curl ⃗F
	
· ⃗k = ∂F2
∂x −∂F1
∂y .
Now let’s look at the right hand side. The circulation density around ⃗k is calculated using circles
perpendicular to ⃗k ; hence, the ⃗k -component of ⃗F does not contribute to it; that is, the circulation
density of ⃗F around ⃗k is the same as the circulation density of F1⃗i + F2⃗j around ⃗k . But in any
plane perpendicular to ⃗k , z is constant, so in that plane F1 and F2 are functions of x and y alone.
Thus, F1⃗i +F2⃗j can be thought of as a two-dimensional vector ﬁeld on the horizontal plane through
the point (x, y, z) where the circulation density is being calculated. Let C be a circle in this plane,
with radius a and centered at (x, y, z), and let R be the region enclosed by C. Green’s Theorem
says that

C
(F1⃗i + F2⃗j ) · d⃗r =

R
∂F2
∂x −∂F1

When the circle is small, ∂F2/∂x −∂F1/∂y is approximately constant on R, so

Thus, taking a limit as the radius of the circle goes to zero, we have

Curl-Free Vector Fields
A vector ﬁeld is said to be curl free or irrotational if curl ⃗F = ⃗0 everywhere that ⃗F is deﬁned.

Figure 20.8 shows the vector ﬁeld ⃗B for three values of the constant p, where ⃗B is deﬁned on
3-space by
⃗B =

Solution
(a) We can use the following version of the product rule for curl. If φ is a scalar function and ⃗F is
a vector ﬁeld, then
curl(φ⃗F ) = φ curl ⃗F + (gradφ) × ⃗F .

Chapter Twenty THE CURL AND STOKES’ THEOREM
20.2
STOKES’ THEOREM
The Divergence Theorem says that the integral of the ﬂux density over a solid region is equal to the
ﬂux through the surface bounding the region. Similarly, Stokes’ Theorem says that the integral of
the circulation density over a surface is equal to the circulation around the boundary of the surface.
The Boundary of a Surface
The boundary of a surface S is the curve or curves running around the edge of S (like the hem
around the edge of a piece of cloth). An orientation of S determines an orientation for its boundary,
C, as follows. Pick a positive normal vector⃗n on S, near C, and use the right-hand rule to determine
a direction of travel around ⃗n . This in turn determines a direction of travel around the boundary C.
See Figure 20.12. Another way of describing the orientation on C is that someone walking along C
in the forward direction, body upright in the direction of the positive normal on S, would have the
surface on their left. Notice that the boundary can consist of two or more curves, as the surface on
the right in Figure 20.12 shows.

Calculating the Circulation from the Circulation Density
Consider a closed, oriented curve C in 3-space. We can ﬁnd the circulation of a vector ﬁeld ⃗F
around C by calculating the line integral:
Circulation
around C
=

C
⃗F · d⃗r .
If C is the boundary of an oriented surface S, there is another way to calculate the circulation using
curl ⃗F . We subdivide S into pieces as shown on the surface on the left in Figure 20.12. If ⃗n is a
positive unit normal vector to a piece of surface with area ΔA, then Δ ⃗A = ⃗n ΔA. In addition,
circ⃗n ⃗F is the circulation density of ⃗F around ⃗n , so
Circulation of ⃗F around
boundary of the piece
≈

circ⃗n ⃗F
	
ΔA = ((curl ⃗F ) · ⃗n )ΔA = (curl⃗F ) · Δ ⃗A .
Next we add up the circulations around all the small pieces. The line integral along the common
edge of a pair of adjacent pieces appears with opposite sign in each piece, so it cancels out. (See
Figure 20.13.) When we add up all the pieces the internal edges cancel and we are left with the
circulation around C, the boundary of the entire surface. Thus,
Circulation

Taking the limit as ΔA →0, we get

20.2 STOKES’ THEOREM

Figure 20.13: Two adjacent pieces of the surface
We have expressed the circulation as a line integral around C and as a ﬂux integral over S; thus,
the two integrals must be equal. Hence we have1
Theorem 20.1: Stokes’ Theorem
If S is a smooth oriented surface with piecewise smooth, oriented boundary C, and if ⃗F is a
smooth vector ﬁeld on an open region containing S and C, then

C
⃗F · d⃗r =

S
curl ⃗F · d ⃗A .
The orientation of C is determined from the orientation of S according to the right-hand rule.
Example 1
Let ⃗F (x, y, z) = −2y⃗i + 2x⃗j . Use Stokes’ Theorem to ﬁnd

C ⃗F · d⃗r , where C is a circle
(a) Parallel to the yz-plane, of radius a, centered at a point on the x-axis, with either orientation.
(b) Parallel to the xy-plane, of radius a, centered at a point on the z-axis, oriented counterclockwise
as viewed from a point on the z-axis above the circle.
Solution
We have curl ⃗F = 4⃗k . Figure 20.14 shows sketches of ⃗F and curl ⃗F .
(a) Let S be the disk enclosed by C. Since S lies in a vertical plane and curl ⃗F points vertically
everywhere, the ﬂux of curl ⃗F through S is zero. Hence, by Stokes’ Theorem,

C
⃗F · d⃗r =

S
curl ⃗F · d ⃗A = 0.
It makes sense that the line integral is zero. If C is parallel to the yz-plane (even if it is not lying
in the plane), the symmetry of the vector ﬁeld means that the line integral of ⃗F over the top half
of the circle cancels the line integral over the bottom half.
(b) Let S be the horizontal disk enclosed by C. Since curl ⃗F is a constant vector ﬁeld pointing in
the direction of ⃗k , we have, by Stokes’ Theorem,

Chapter Twenty THE CURL AND STOKES’ THEOREM
Since ⃗F is circling around the z-axis in the same direction as C, we expect the line integral to
be positive. In fact, in Example 1 on page 1049, we computed this line integral directly.
Curl Free Vector Fields
Stokes’ Theorem applies to any oriented surface S and its boundary C, even in cases where the
boundary consists of two or more curves. This is useful in studying curl-free vector ﬁelds.


C2 ⃗B · d⃗r , where C2 is the ellipse x2 + 9y2 = 9

(a) On the circle C1, we have ∥⃗B ∥= 2I/(ca). Since ⃗B is tangent to C1 everywhere and points in
the forward direction around C1,

(b) Let S be the conical surface extending from C1 to C2 in Figure 20.15. The boundary of this

Curl Fields
A vector ﬁeld ⃗F is called a curl ﬁeld if ⃗F
= curl ⃗G for some vector ﬁeld ⃗G . Recall that if
⃗F = gradf, then f is called a potential function. By analogy, if a vector ﬁeld ⃗F = curl ⃗G , then ⃗G
is called a vector potential for ⃗F . The following example shows that the ﬂux of a curl ﬁeld through
a surface depends only on the boundary of the surface. This is analogous to the fact that the line
integral of a gradient ﬁeld depends only on the endpoints of the path.
Example 3
Suppose ⃗F = curl ⃗G . Suppose that S1 and S2 are two oriented surfaces with the same boundary
C. Show that, if S1 and S2 determine the same orientation on C (as in Figure 20.16), then

S1
⃗F · d ⃗A =

S2
⃗F · d ⃗A .
If S1 and S2 determine opposite orientations on C, then

S1
⃗F · d ⃗A = −

S2
⃗F · d ⃗A .
Solution
Since ⃗F = curl ⃗G , by Stokes’ Theorem we have

⃗F · d ⃗A =


S2
curl ⃗G · d ⃗A =

In each case the line integral on the right must be computed using the orientation determined by the
surface. Thus, the two ﬂux integrals of ⃗F are the same if the orientations are the same and they are
opposite if the orientations are opposite.

20.3 THE THREE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS
1063
The Gradient and the Curl
Suppose that ⃗F is a smooth gradient ﬁeld, so ⃗F = gradf for some function f. Using the Funda-
mental Theorem for Line Integrals, we saw in Chapter 18 that

C
⃗F · d⃗r = 0
for any closed curve C. Thus, for any unit vector ⃗n
circ⃗n ⃗F =
lim
Area→0

C
⃗F · d⃗r
Area of C =
lim
Area→0
0
Area = 0,
where the limit is taken over circles C in a plane perpendicular to ⃗n , and oriented by the right-hand
rule. Thus, the circulation density of ⃗F is zero in every direction, so curl ⃗F = ⃗0 , that is,
curl gradf = ⃗0 .
(This formula can also be veriﬁed using the coordinate deﬁnition of curl. See Problem 28 on
page 1054.)
Is the converse true? Is any vector ﬁeld whose curl is zero a gradient ﬁeld? Suppose that
curl ⃗F
= ⃗0 and let us consider the line integral 
C ⃗F · d⃗r for a closed curve C contained in
the domain of ⃗F . If C is the boundary curve of an oriented surface S that lies wholly in the domain
of curl ⃗F , then Stokes’ Theorem asserts that

C
⃗F · d⃗r =

S
curl ⃗F · d ⃗A =

S
⃗0 · d ⃗A = 0.
If we knew that 
C ⃗F · d⃗r = 0 for every closed curve C, then ⃗F would be path-independent, and
hence a gradient ﬁeld. Thus, we need to know whether every closed curve in the domain of ⃗F is
the boundary of an oriented surface contained in the domain. It can be quite difﬁcult to determine
if a given curve is the boundary of a surface (suppose, for example, that the curve is knotted in a
complicated way). However, if the curve can be contracted smoothly to a point, remaining all the
time in the domain of ⃗F , then it is the boundary of a surface, namely, the surface it sweeps through
as it contracts. Thus, we have proved the test for a gradient ﬁeld that we stated in Chapter 18.
The Curl Test for Vector Fields in 3-Space
Suppose ⃗F is a smooth vector ﬁeld on 3-space such that
• The domain of ⃗F has the property that every closed curve in it can be contracted to a
point in a smooth way, staying at all times within the domain.
• curl ⃗F = ⃗0 .
Then ⃗F is path-independent, and thus is a gradient ﬁeld.
Example 7 on page 992 shows how the curl test is applied.
The Curl and the Divergence
In this section we will use the second two fundamental theorems to get a test for a vector ﬁeld to be
a curl ﬁeld, that is, a ﬁeld of the form ⃗F = curl ⃗G for some ⃗G .
Example 1
Suppose that ⃗F is a smooth curl ﬁeld. Use Stokes’ Theorem to show that for any closed surface, S,
contained in the domain of ⃗F

S
⃗F · d ⃗A = 0.

1064
Chapter Twenty THE CURL AND STOKES’ THEOREM
Solution
Suppose ⃗F = curl ⃗G . Draw a closed curve C on the surface S, thus dividing S into two surfaces S1
and S2 as shown in Figure 20.21. Pick the orientation for C corresponding to S1; then the orientation
of C corresponding to S2 is the opposite. Thus, using Stokes’ Theorem,

S1
⃗F · d ⃗A =

S1
curl ⃗G · d ⃗A =

C
⃗G · d⃗r = −

S2
curl ⃗G · d ⃗A = −

S2
⃗F · d ⃗A .
Thus, for any closed surface S, we have

S
⃗F · d ⃗A =

S1
⃗F · d ⃗A +

S2
⃗F · d ⃗A = 0.

Thus, if ⃗F = curl ⃗G , we use the result of Example 1 to see that
div ⃗F =
lim
Volume→0

S
⃗F · d ⃗A
Volume enclosed by S =
lim
Volume→0
0
Volume = 0,
where the limit is taken over spheres S contracting down to a point. So we conclude that:
div curl ⃗G = 0.
(This formula can also be veriﬁed using coordinates. See Problem 27 on page 1054.)
Is every vector ﬁeld whose divergence is zero a curl ﬁeld? It turns out that we have the following
analogue of the curl test, though we will not prove it.
The Divergence Test for Vector Fields in 3-Space
Suppose ⃗F is a smooth vector ﬁeld on 3-space such that
• The domain of ⃗F has the property that every closed surface in it is the boundary of a
solid region completely contained in the domain.
• div ⃗F = 0.
Then ⃗F is a curl ﬁeld.

(a) Calculate div ⃗E and div ⃗B .
(b) Do ⃗E and ⃗B satisfy the divergence test?
(c) Is either ⃗E or ⃗B a curl ﬁeld?

20.3 THE THREE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS
1065
Solution
(a) Example 3 on page 1028 shows that div ⃗E = 0. The following calculation shows div ⃗B = 0
also:
div ⃗B = 2I

= 0.
(b) The domain of ⃗E is 3-space minus the origin, so a region is contained in the domain if it misses
the origin. Thus, the surface of a sphere centered at the origin is contained in the domain of E,
but the solid ball inside is not. Hence, ⃗E does not satisfy the divergence test.
The domain of ⃗B is 3-space minus the z-axis, so a region is contained in the domain if it
avoids the z-axis. If S is a surface bounding a solid region W, then the z-axis cannot pierce
W without piercing S as well. Hence, if S avoids the z-axis, so does W. Thus, ⃗B satisﬁes the
divergence test.
(c) In Example 3 on page 1036 we computed the ﬂux of ⃗r /∥⃗r ∥3 through a sphere centered at the
origin, and found it was 4π, so the ﬂux of ⃗E through this sphere is 4πq. Thus, ⃗E cannot be a
curl ﬁeld, because by Example 1, the ﬂux of a curl ﬁeld through a closed surface is zero.
On the other hand, ⃗B satisﬁes the divergence test, so it must be a curl ﬁeld. In fact, Prob-
lem 24 shows that
⃗B = curl

c ln(x2 + y2)⃗k

1. Magnetic Field Generated by a Current in a Wire
Under steady-state conditions, a magnetic ﬁeld ⃗B has curl ⃗B = ⃗0 in a region where
there is no current. We study the steady-state magnetic ﬁeld ⃗B due to a constant current in
an inﬁnitely long straight thin wire. The magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld at a point depends
only on the distance from the wire and its direction is tangent to the circle around the wire
and determined by the right-hand rule. Suppose the current is ﬂowing upward along the z-axis.
Then ⃗B is parallel to the xy-plane and, by the right-hand rule, points counterclockwise around
a circle centered on the z-axis. (See Figure 20.26.)

The scalar c is called the scalar curl or the vorticity of the vector ﬁeld ⃗F . This problem shows
that the vorticity is the difference of two terms, the curvature vorticity, Fθ⃗T , due to turning of
the ﬂow lines of ⃗F , and the shear vorticity, F ⃗
N , due to changes in the magnitude of ⃗F in a
direction normal to ⃗F .

21.1
COORDINATES AND PARAMETERIZED SURFACES
In Chapter 17 we parameterized curves in 2- and 3-space, and in Chapter 16 we used polar, cylin-
drical, and spherical coordinates to simplify iterated integrals. We now take a second look at pa-
rameterizations and coordinate systems, and see that they are the same thing in different disguises:
functions from one space to another.
We have already seen this with parameterized curves, which we view as a function from an
interval a ≤t ≤b to a curve in xyz-space. See Figure 21.1.

Polar, Cylindrical, and Spherical Coordinates Revisited
The equations for polar coordinates,
x = r cos θ
y = r sin θ,
can also be viewed as deﬁning a function from the rθ-plane into the xy-plane. This function trans-
forms the rectangle on the left of Figure 21.2 into the quarter disk on the right. We need two param-
eters to describe this disk because it is a two-dimensional object.
Polar Coordinates as Families of Parameterized Curves
Polar coordinates give two families of parameterized curves, which form the polar coordinate grid.
The lines r = Constant in the rθ-plane correspond to circles in the xy-plane, each circle param-
eterized by θ; the lines θ = Constant correspond to rays in the xy-plane, each ray parameterized
by r.
Cylindrical and Spherical Coordinates
Similarly, cylindrical and spherical coordinates may be viewed as functions from 3-space to 3-space.
Cylindrical coordinates take rectangular boxes in rθz-space and map them to cylindrical regions in
xyz-space; spherical coordinates take rectangular boxes in ρθφ-space and map them to spherical
regions in xyz-space.

21.1 COORDINATES AND PARAMETERIZED SURFACES
1075
General Parameterizations
In general, a parameterization or coordinate system provides a way of representing a curved object
by means of a simple region in the parameter space (an interval, rectangle, or rectangular box),
along with a function mapping that region into the curved object. In the next section, we use this
idea to parameterize curved surfaces in 3-space.
How Do We Parameterize a Surface?
In Section 17.1 we parameterized a circle in 2-space using the equations
x = cos t,
y = sin t.
In 3-space, the same circle in the xy-plane has parametric equations
x = cos t,
y = sin t,
z = 0.
We add the equation z = 0 to specify that the circle is in the xy-plane. If we wanted a circle in the
plane z = 3, we would use the equations
x = cos t,
y = sin t,
z = 3.
Suppose now we let z vary freely, as well as t. We get circles in every horizontal plane, forming
a cylinder as in the left of Figure 21.3. Thus, we need two parameters, t and z, to parameterize the
cylinder.

We can contrast curves and surfaces. A curve, though it may live in two or three dimensions,
is itself one-dimensional; if we move along it we can only move backward and forward in one
direction. Thus, it only requires one parameter to trace out a curve.
A surface is 2-dimensional; at any given point there are two independent directions we can
move. For example, on the cylinder we can move vertically, or we can circle around the z-axis
horizontally. So we need two parameters to describe it. We can think of the parameters as map
coordinates, like longitude and latitude on the surface of the earth. Just as polar coordinates give
a polar grid on a circular region, so the parameters for a surface give a grid on the surface. See
Figure 21.3 on the right.
In the case of the cylinder our parameters are t and z, so
x = cos t,
y = sin t,
z = z,
0 ≤t < 2π,
−∞< z < ∞.
The last equation, z = z, looks strange, but it reminds us that we are in three dimensions, not two,
and that the z-coordinate on our surface is allowed to vary freely.
In general, we express the coordinates, (x, y, z), of a point on a surface S in terms of two
parameters, s and t:
x = f1(s, t),
y = f2(s, t),
z = f3(s, t).

Chapter Twenty-One PARAMETERS, COORDINATES, AND INTEGRALS
As the values of s and t vary, the corresponding point (x, y, z) sweeps out the surface, S. (See
Figure 21.4.) The function which sends the point (s, t) to the point (x, y, z) is called the parameter-
ization of the surface.

(x, y, z) = (f1(s, t), f2(s, t), f3(s, t)) in the surface, S
Using Position Vectors
We can use the position vector ⃗r = x⃗i + y⃗j + z⃗k to combine the three parametric equations
for a surface into a single vector equation. For example, the parameterization of the cylinder x =
cos t, y = sin t, z = z can be written as
⃗r (t, z) = cos t⃗i + sin t⃗j + z⃗k
0 ≤t < 2π,
−∞< z < ∞.
For a general parameterized surface S, we write
⃗r (s, t) = f1(s, t)⃗i + f2(s, t)⃗j + f3(s, t)⃗k .
Parameterizing a Surface of the Form z = f(x, y)
The graph of a function z = f(x, y) can be given parametrically simply by letting the parameters s
and t be x and y:
x = s,
y = t,
z = f(s, t).
Example 1
Give a parametric description of the lower hemisphere of the sphere x2 + y2 + z2 = 1.
Solution
The surface is the graph of the function z = −

1 −x2 −y2 over the region x2 + y2 ≤1 in the
plane. Then parametric equations are x = s, y = t, z = −
√
1 −s2 −t2, where the parameters s
and t vary inside the unit circle.
In practice we often think of x and y as parameters rather than introduce new parameters s and
t. Thus, we may write x = x, y = y, z = f(x, y).
Parameterizing Planes
Consider a plane containing two nonparallel vectors ⃗v 1 and ⃗v 2 and a point P0 with position vector
⃗r 0. We can get to any point on the plane by starting at P0 and moving parallel to ⃗v 1 or ⃗v 2, adding
multiples of them to ⃗r 0. (See Figure 21.5.)

⃗v2
P0
Figure 21.5: The plane ⃗r (s, t) = ⃗r 0 + s⃗v 1 + t⃗v 2 and

Since s⃗v 1 is parallel to ⃗v 1 and t⃗v 2 is parallel to ⃗v 2, we have the following result:

21.1 COORDINATES AND PARAMETERIZED SURFACES
1077
Parameterizing a Plane
The plane through the point with position vector ⃗r 0 and containing the two nonparallel vec-
tors ⃗v 1 and ⃗v 2 has parameterization
⃗r (s, t) = ⃗r 0 + s⃗v 1 + t⃗v 2.
If ⃗r 0 = x0⃗i + y0⃗j + z0⃗k , and ⃗v 1 = a1⃗i + a2⃗j + a3⃗k , and ⃗v 2 = b1⃗i + b2⃗j + b3⃗k , then the
parameterization of the plane can be expressed with the parametric equations
x = x0 + sa1 + tb1,
y = y0 + sa2 + tb2,
z = z0 + sa3 + tb3.
Notice that the parameterization of the plane expresses the coordinates x, y, and z as linear
functions of the parameters s and t.
Example 2
Write a parameterization for the plane through the point (2, −1, 3) and containing the vectors ⃗v 1 =
2⃗i + 3⃗j −⃗k and ⃗v 2 =⃗i −4⃗j + 5⃗k .
Solution
A possible parameterization is
⃗r (s, t) = ⃗r 0 + s⃗v 1 + t⃗v 2 = 2⃗i −⃗j + 3⃗k + s(2⃗i + 3⃗j −⃗k ) + t(⃗i −4⃗j + 5⃗k )
= (2 + 2s + t)⃗i + (−1 + 3s −4t)⃗j + (3 −s + 5t)⃗k ,
or equivalently,
x = 2 + 2s + t,
y = −1 + 3s −4t,
z = 3 −s + 5t.
Parameterizations Using Spherical Coordinates
Recall the spherical coordinates ρ, φ, and θ introduced on page 899 of Chapter 16. On a sphere of
radius ρ = a we can use φ and θ as coordinates, similar to latitude and longitude on the surface
of the earth. (See Figure 21.6.) The latitude, however, is measured from the equator, whereas φ is
measured from the north pole. If the positive x-axis passes through the Greenwich meridian, the
longitude and θ are equal for 0 ≤θ ≤π.

Example 3
You are at a point on a sphere with φ = 3π/4. Are you in the northern or southern hemisphere? If
φ decreases, do you move closer to or farther from the equator?
Solution
The equator has φ = π/2. Since 3π/4 > π/2, you are in the southern hemisphere. If φ decreases,
you move closer to the equator.
Example 4
On a sphere, you are standing at a point with coordinates θ0 and φ0. Your antipodal point is the point
on the other side of the sphere on a line through you and the center. What are the θ, φ coordinates
of your antipodal point?

1078
Chapter Twenty-One PARAMETERS, COORDINATES, AND INTEGRALS
Solution
Figure 21.7 shows that the coordinates are θ = θ0 + π if θ0 < π or θ = θ0 −π if π ≤θ0 ≤2π, and
φ = π −φ0. Notice that if you are on the equator, then so is your antipodal point.

Parameterizing a Sphere Using Spherical Coordinates
The sphere with radius 1 centered at the origin is parameterized by
x = sin φ cos θ,
y = sin φ sin θ,
z = cos φ,
where 0 ≤θ ≤2π and 0 ≤φ ≤π. (See Figure 21.8.)

We can also write these equations in vector form:
⃗r (θ, φ) = sin φ cos θ⃗i + sin φ sin θ⃗j + cos φ⃗k .
Since x2 + y2 + z2 = sin2 φ(cos2 θ + sin2 θ) + cos2 φ = sin2 φ + cos2 φ = 1, this veriﬁes that
the point with position vector ⃗r (θ, φ) does lie on the sphere of radius 1. Notice that the z-coordinate
depends only on the parameter φ. Geometrically, this means that all points on the same latitude have
the same z-coordinate.
Example 5
Find parametric equations for the following spheres:
(a) Center at the origin and radius 2.
(b) Center at the point (2, −1, 3) and radius 2.
Solution
(a) We must scale the distance from the origin by 2. Thus, we have
x = 2 sin φ cos θ,
y = 2 sin φ sin θ,
z = 2 cosφ,
where 0 ≤θ ≤2π and 0 ≤φ ≤π. In vector form, this is written
⃗r (θ, φ) = 2 sin φ cos θ⃗i + 2 sin φ sin θ⃗j + 2 cos φ⃗k .

(b) To shift the center of the sphere from the origin to the point (2, −1, 3), we add the vector
parameterization we found in part (a) to the position vector of (2, −1, 3). (See Figure 21.9.)
This gives
⃗r (θ, φ) = 2⃗i −⃗j + 3⃗k + (2 sin φ cos θ⃗i + 2 sin φ sin θ⃗j + 2 cosφ⃗k )
= (2 + 2 sin φ cos θ)⃗i + (−1 + 2 sin φ sin θ)⃗j + (3 + 2 cosφ)⃗k ,
where 0 ≤θ ≤2π and 0 ≤φ ≤π. Alternatively,
x = 2 + 2 sin φ cos θ,
y = −1 + 2 sin φ sin θ,
z = 3 + 2 cos φ.
Note that the same point can have more than one value for θ or φ. For example, points with
θ = 0 also have θ = 2π, unless we restrict θ to the range 0 ≤θ < 2π. Also, the north pole, at
φ = 0, and the south pole, at φ = π, can have any value of θ.
Parameterizing Surfaces of Revolution
Many surfaces have an axis of rotational symmetry and circular cross-sections perpendicular to that
axis. These surfaces are referred to as surfaces of revolution.
Example 6
Find a parameterization of the cone whose base is the circle x2 + y2 = a2 in the xy-plane and
whose vertex is at height h above the xy-plane. (See Figure 21.10.)

Chapter Twenty-One PARAMETERS, COORDINATES, AND INTEGRALS
Solution
We use cylindrical coordinates, r, θ, z. (See Figure 21.10.) In the xy-plane, the radius vector, ⃗r 0,
from the z-axis to a point on the cone in the xy-plane is
⃗r 0 = a cos θ⃗i + a sin θ⃗j .
Above the xy-plane, the radius of the circular cross-section, r, decreases linearly from r = a when
z = 0 to r = 0 when z = h. From the similar triangles in Figure 21.10,
a
h =
r
h −z .
Solving for r, we have
r =

1 −z
h
	
a.
The horizontal radius vector, ⃗r 1, at height z has components similar to ⃗r 0, but with a replaced by
r:
⃗r 1 = r cos θ⃗i + r sin θ⃗j =

1 −z
h
	
a cosθ⃗i +

1 −z

a sin θ⃗j .
As θ goes from 0 to 2π, the vector ⃗r1 traces out the horizontal circle in Figure 21.10. We get the
position vector, ⃗r , of a point on the cone by adding the vector z⃗k , so
⃗r = ⃗r 1 + z⃗k = a

The parameters are θ and z.

cm from the large open end is given by the function
f(x) =
6
(x + 1)0.7 .
The bell is obtained by rotating the graph of f about the x-axis. Find a parameterization for the ﬁrst
24 cm of the bell. (See Figure 21.11.)

Figure 21.11: The bell of a trumpet obtained by rotating the

Solution
At distance x from the large open end of the horn, the cross-section parallel to the yz-plane is a circle
of radius f(x), with center on the x-axis. Such a circle can be parameterized by y = f(x) cos θ,
z = f(x) sin θ. Thus, we have the parameterization

Parameter Curves
On a parameterized surface, the curve obtained by setting one of the parameters equal to a constant
and letting the other vary is called a parameter curve. If the surface is parameterized by
⃗r (s, t) = f1(s, t)⃗i + f2(s, t)⃗j + f3(s, t)⃗k ,
there are two families of parameter curves on the surface, one family with t constant and the other
with s constant.
Example 8
Consider the vertical cylinder
x = cos t,
y = sin t,
z = z.
(a) Describe the two parameter curves through the point (0, 1, 1).
(b) Describe the family of parameter curves with t constant and the family with z constant.
Solution
(a) Since the point (0, 1, 1) corresponds to the parameter values t = π/2 and z = 1, there are
two parameter curves, one with t = π/2 and the other with z = 1. The parameter curve with
t = π/2 has the parametric equations
x = cos
π
2
	
= 0,
y = sin
π
2
	
= 1,
z = z,
with parameter z. This is a line through the point (0, 1, 1) parallel to the z-axis.
The parameter curve with z = 1 has the parametric equations
x = cos t,
y = sin t,
z = 1,
with parameter t. This is a unit circle parallel to and one unit above the xy-plane centered on
the z-axis.
(b) First, ﬁx t = t0 for t and let z vary. The curves parameterized by z have equations
x = cos t0,
y = sin t0,
z = z.
These are vertical lines on the cylinder parallel to the z-axis. (See Figure 21.12.)
The other family is obtained by ﬁxing z = z0 and varying t. Curves in this family are
parameterized by t and have equations
x = cos t,
y = sin t,
z = z0.
They are circles of radius 1 parallel to the xy-plane centered on the z-axis. (See Figure 21.13.)

Solution
Since φ measures latitude, the family with φ constant consists of the circles of constant latitude. (See
Figure 21.14.) Similarly, the family with θ constant consists of the meridians (semicircles) running
between the north and south poles. (See Figure 21.15.)

with x = a or y = b on a surface z = f(x, y) are examples of parameter curves. So are the grid
lines on a computer sketch of a surface. The small regions shaped like parallelograms surrounded
by nearby pairs of parameter curves are called parameter rectangles. See Figure 21.16.

CHANGE OF COORDINATES IN A MULTIPLE INTEGRAL
In Chapter 16 we used polar, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates to simplify iterated integrals.
In this section, we discuss more general changes of coordinate. In the process, we see where the
factors r and ρ2 sin φ come from when we convert to polar, cylindrical, or spherical coordinates
(see pages 892, 897, and 900).
Polar Change of Coordinates Revisited
Consider the integral

R(x+y) dA where R is the region in the ﬁrst quadrant bounded by the circle
x2 +y2 = 16 and the x and y-axes. Writing the integral in Cartesian and polar coordinates, we have

The integral on the right is over the rectangle in the rθ-plane given by 0 ≤r ≤4, 0 ≤θ ≤
π/2. The conversion from polar to Cartesian coordinates changes this rectangle into a quarter-disk.
Figure 21.18 shows how a typical rectangle (shaded) in the rθ-plane with sides of length Δr and
Δθ corresponds to a curved rectangle in the xy-plane with sides of length Δr and rΔθ. The extra r
is needed because the correspondence between r, θ and x, y not only curves the lines r = 1, 2, 3 . . .
into circles, it also stretches those lines around larger and larger circles.

General Change of Coordinates
We now consider a general change of coordinates, where x, y coordinates are related to s, t coordi-
nates by the differentiable functions
x = x(s, t)
y = y(s, t).
Just as a rectangular region in the rθ-plane corresponds to a region in the xy-plane, a rectangular
region, T , in the st-plane corresponds to a region, R, in the xy-plane. We assume that the change
of coordinates is one-to-one, that is, that each point in R corresponds to only one point in T .

Figure 21.19: A small rectangle Tij in the st-plane and the corresponding region Rij of the xy-plane
We divide T into small rectangles Tij with sides of length Δs and Δt. (See Figure 21.19.)
The corresponding piece Rij of the xy-plane is a quadrilateral with curved sides. If we choose
Δs and Δt small, then by local linearity of x(s, t) and y(s, t), we know Rij is approximately a
parallelogram.
Recall from Chapter 13 that the area of the parallelogram with sides ⃗a and⃗b is ∥⃗a ×⃗b ∥. Thus,
we need to ﬁnd the sides of Rij as vectors. The side of Rij corresponding to the bottom side of Tij
has endpoints (x(s, t), y(s, t)) and (x(s + Δs, t), y(s + Δs, t)), so in vector form that side is
⃗a = (x(s + Δs, t) −x(s, t))⃗i + (y(s + Δs, t) −y(s, t))⃗j ≈

To convert an integral from x, y to s, t coordinates we make three changes:
1. Substitute for x and y in the integrand in terms of s and t.
2. Change the xy region R into an st region T .

Change of Coordinates in Triple Integrals
For triple integrals, there is a similar formula. Suppose the differentiable functions
x = x(s, t, u),
y = y(s, t, u),
z = z(s, t, u)
deﬁne a one-to-one change of coordinates from a region S in stu-space to a region W in xyz-space.
Then, the Jacobian of this change of coordinates is given by the determinant2

Problem 11 at the end of this section asks you to check that the Jacobian for the change of coor-

Solution
Let x = as, y = bt, z = cu. The Jacobian is computed to be abc. The xyz-ellipsoid corresponds
to the stu-sphere s2 + t2 + u2 = 1. Thus, as in Example 2,
Volume of xyz-ellipsoid = abc · Volume of stu-sphere = abc4

FLUX INTEGRALS OVER PARAMETERIZED SURFACES
Most of the ﬂux integrals we are likely to encounter can be computed using the methods of Sec-
tions 19.1 and 19.2. In this section, we brieﬂy consider the general case: how to compute the ﬂux of
a smooth vector ﬁeld ⃗F through a smooth oriented surface, S, parameterized by
⃗r = ⃗r (s, t),
for (s, t) in some region R of the parameter space. The method is similar to the one used for graphs
in Section 19.2. We consider a parameter rectangle on the surface S corresponding to a rectangular
region with sides Δs and Δt in the parameter space. (See Figure 21.21.)

We assume that the vector ∂⃗r /∂s × ∂⃗r /∂t is never zero and points in the direction of the unit
normal orientation vector ⃗n . If the vector ∂⃗r /∂s × ∂⃗r /∂t points in the opposite direction to ⃗n , we
reverse the order of the cross product. Replacing Δ ⃗A , Δs, and Δt by d ⃗A , ds, and dt, we write

gral might not exist if we subdivide the surface in the wrong
way. One way to get around this is to take the formula for a
ﬂux integral over a parameterized surface that we have devel-
oped in this section and to use it as the deﬁnition of the ﬂux
integral. In Problems 17–20 we explore how this works.
17. Use a parameterization to verify the formula for a ﬂux
integral over a surface graph on page 1018.
18. Use a parameterization to verify the formula for a ﬂux
integral over a cylindrical surface on page 1019.
19. Use a parameterization to verify the formula for a ﬂux
integral over a spherical surface on page 1020.
20. One problem with deﬁning the ﬂux integral using a
parameterization is that the integral appears to depend
on the choice of parameterization. However, the ﬂux
through a surface ought not to depend on how the surface
is parameterized. Suppose that the surface S has two pa-
rameterizations, ⃗r = ⃗r (s, t) for (s, t) in the region R of
st-space, and also ⃗r = r(u, v) for (u, v) in the region T
in uv-space, and suppose that the two parameterizations
are related by the change of coordinates
u = u(s, t)
v = v(s, t).
Suppose that the Jacobian determinant ∂(u, v)/∂(s, t) is
positive at every point (s, t) in R. Use the change of co-
ordinates formula for double integrals on page 1086 to
show that computing the ﬂux integral using either param-
eterization gives the same result.

ROOTS, ACCURACY, AND BOUNDS
It is often necessary to ﬁnd the zeros of a polynomial or the points of intersection of two curves. So
far, you have probably used algebraic methods, such as the quadratic formula, to solve such prob-
lems. Unfortunately, however, mathematicians’ search for similar solutions to more complicated
equations has not been all that successful. The formulas for the solutions to third- and fourth-degree
equations are so complicated that you’d never want to use them. Early in the nineteenth century, it
was proved that there is no algebraic formula for the solutions to equations of degree 5 and higher.
Most non-polynomial equations cannot be solved using a formula either.
However, we can still ﬁnd roots of equations, provided we use approximation methods, not for-
mulas. In this section we will discuss three ways to ﬁnd roots: algebraic, graphical, and numerical.
Of these, only the algebraic method gives exact solutions.
First, let’s get some terminology straight. Given the equation x2 = 4, we call x = −2 and
x = 2 the roots, or solutions of the equation. If we are given the function f(x) = x2 −4, then −2
and 2 are called the zeros of the function; that is, the zeros of the function f are the roots of the
equation f(x) = 0.
The Algebraic Viewpoint: Roots by Factoring
If the product of two numbers is zero, then one or the other or both must be zero, that is, if AB = 0,
then A = 0 or B = 0. This observation lies behind ﬁnding roots by factoring. You may have spent
a lot of time factoring polynomials. Here you will also factor expressions involving trigonometric
and exponential functions.
Example 1
Find the roots of x2 −7x = 8.
Solution
Rewrite the equation as x2 −7x −8 = 0. Then factor the left side: (x + 1)(x −8) = 0. By our
observation about products, either x + 1 = 0 or x −8 = 0, so the roots are x = −1 and x = 8.
Example 2
Find the roots of 1
x −
x
(x + 2) = 0.
Solution
Rewrite the left side with a common denominator:
x + 2 −x2
x(x + 2)
= 0.
Whenever a fraction is zero, the numerator must be zero. Therefore we must have
x + 2 −x2 = (−1)(x2 −x −2) = (−1)(x −2)(x + 1) = 0.
We conclude that x −2 = 0 or x + 1 = 0, so 2 and −1 are the roots. They can be checked by
substitution.
Example 3
Find the roots of e−x sin x −e−x cos x = 0.
Solution
Factor the left side: e−x(sin x −cos x) = 0. The factor e−x is never zero; it is impossible to raise e
to a power and get zero. Therefore, the only possibility is that sin x −cos x = 0. This equation is
equivalent to sin x = cos x. If we divide both sides by cos x, we get
sin x
cos x = cos x
cos x
so
tan x = 1.
The roots of this equation are
. . . , −7π

4 , 5π
4 , 9π
4 , 13π
4 , . . . .

Appendix A

Warning: Using factoring to solve an equation only works when one side of the equation is 0.
It is not true that if, say, AB = 7 then A = 7 or B = 7. For example, you cannot solve x2 −4x = 2
by factoring x(x −4) = 2 and then assuming that either x or x −4 equals 2.
The problem with factoring is that factors are not easy to ﬁnd. For example, the left side of the
quadratic equation x2 −4x −2 = 0 does not factor, at least not into “nice” factors with integer
coefﬁcients. For the general quadratic equation
ax2 + bx + c = 0,
there is the quadratic formula for the roots:
x = −b ±
√
b2 −4ac
2a
.
Thus the roots of x2 −4x −2 = 0 are (4 ±
√
24)/2, or 2 +
√
6 and 2 −
√
6.
Notice that in each of these examples, we have found the roots exactly.
The Graphical Viewpoint: Roots by Zooming
To ﬁnd the roots of an equation f(x) = 0, it helps to draw the graph of f. The roots of the equation,
that is the zeros of f, are the values of x where the graph of f crosses the x-axis. Even a very rough
sketch of the graph can be useful in determining how many zeros there are and their approximate
values. If you have a computer or graphing calculator, then ﬁnding solutions by graphing is the
easiest method, especially if you use the zoom feature. However, a graph can never tell you the
exact value of a root, only an approximate one.
Example 4
Find the roots of x3 −4x −2 = 0.
Solution
Attempting to factor the left side with integer coefﬁcients will convince you it cannot be done, so
we cannot easily ﬁnd the roots by algebra. We know the graph of f(x) = x3 −4x −2 will have the
usual cubic shape; see Figure A.1.
There are clearly three roots: one between x = −2 and x = −1, another between x = −1
and x = 0, and a third between x = 2 and x = 3. Zooming in on the largest root with a graphing
calculator or computer shows that it lies in the following interval:
2.213 < x < 2.215.
Thus, the root is x = 2.21, accurate to two decimal places. Zooming in on the other two roots shows
them to be x = −1.68 and x = −0.54, accurate to two decimal places.
Useful trick: Suppose you want to solve the equation sin x −cos x = 0 graphically. Instead of
graphing f(x) = sin x −cos x and looking for zeros, you may ﬁnd it easier to rewrite the equation
as sin x = cos x and graph g(x) = sin x and h(x) = cos x. (After all, you already know what these
two graphs look like. See Figure A.2.) The roots of the original equation are then precisely the x
coordinates of the points of intersection of the graphs of g(x) and h(x).

Example 5
Find the roots of 2 sin x −x = 0.
Solution
Rewrite the equation as 2 sin x = x, and graph both sides. Since g(x) = 2 sin x is always between
−2 and 2, there are no roots of 2 sin x = x for x > 2 or for x < −2. We need only consider the
graphs between −2 and 2 (or between −π and π, which makes graphing the sine function easier).
Figure A.3 shows the graphs. There are three points of intersection: one appears to be at x = 0, one
between x = π/2 and x = π, and one between x = −π/2 and x = −π. You can tell that x = 0 is
the exact value of one root because it satisﬁes the original equation exactly. Zooming in shows that
there is a second root x ≈1.9, and the third root is x ≈−1.9 by symmetry.

The Numerical Viewpoint: Roots by Bisection
We now look at a numerical method of approximating the solutions to an equation. This method
depends on the idea that if the value of a function f(x) changes sign in an interval, and if we believe
there is no break in the graph of the function there, then there is a root of the equation f(x) = 0 in
that interval.
Let’s go back to the problem of ﬁnding the root of f(x) = x3 −4x−2 = 0 between 2 and 3. To
locate the root, we close in on it by evaluating the function at the midpoint of the interval, x = 2.5.
Since f(2) = −2, f(2.5) = 3.625, and f(3) = 13, the function changes sign between x = 2 and
x = 2.5, so the root is between these points. Now we look at x = 2.25.
Since f(2.25) = 0.39, the function is negative at x = 2 and positive at x = 2.25, so there
is a root between 2 and 2.25. Now we look at 2.125. We ﬁnd f(2.125) = −0.90, so there is a
root between 2.125 and 2.25, . . . and so on. (You may want to round the decimals as you work.)
See Figure A.4. The intervals containing the root are listed in Table A.1 and show that the root is
x = 2.21 to two decimal places.

This method of estimating roots is called the Bisection Method:
• To solve an equation f(x) = 0 using the bisection method, we need two starting values
for x, say, x = a and x = b, such that f(a) and f(b) have opposite signs and f is
continuous on [a, b].
• Evaluate f at the midpoint of the interval [a, b], and decide in which half-interval the root
lies.
• Repeat, using the new half-interval instead of [a, b].
There are some problems with the bisection method:
• The function may not change signs near the root. For example, f(x) = x2 −2x + 1 = 0 has
a root at x = 1, but f(x) is never negative because f(x) = (x −1)2, and a square cannot be
negative. (See Figure A.5.)
• The function f must be continuous between the starting values x = a and x = b.
• If there is more than one root between the starting values x = a and x = b, the method will
ﬁnd only one of the roots. For example, if we had tried to solve x3 −4x −2 = 0 starting at
x = −12 and x = 10, the bisection method would zero in on the root between x = −2 and
x = −1, not the root between x = 2 and x = 3 that we found earlier. (Try it! Then see what
happens if you use x = −10 instead of x = −12.)
• The bisection method is slow and not very efﬁcient. Applying bisection three times in a row
only traps the root in an interval ( 1
2)3 = 1
8 as large as the starting interval. Thus, if we initially
know that a root is between, say, 2 and 3, then we would need to apply the bisection method at
least four times to know the ﬁrst digit after the decimal point.
There are much more powerful methods available for ﬁnding roots, such as Newton’s method, which
are more complicated but which avoid some of these difﬁculties.

Find all the roots of xex = 5 to at least one decimal place.
Solution
If we rewrite the equation as ex = 5/x and graph both sides, as in Figure A.6, it is clear that there
is exactly one root, and it is somewhere between 1 and 2. Table A.2 shows the intervals obtained by
the bisection method. After ﬁve iterations, we have the root trapped between 1.3125 and 1.34375,
so we can say the root is x = 1.3 to one decimal place.

Appendix A
Iteration
Both zooming in and bisection as discussed here are examples of iterative methods, in which a
sequence of steps is repeated over and over again, using the results of one step as the input for the
next. We can use such methods to locate a root to any degree of accuracy. In bisection, each iteration
traps the root in an interval that is half the length of the previous one. Each time you zoom in on a
calculator, you trap the root in a smaller interval; how much smaller depends on the settings on the
calculator.
Accuracy and Error
In the previous discussion, we used the phrase “accurate to 2 decimal places.” For an iterative pro-
cess where we get closer and closer estimates of some quantity, we take a common-sense approach
to accuracy: we watch the numbers carefully, and when a digit stays the same for several iterations,
we assume it has stabilized and is correct, especially if the digits to the right of that digit also stay
the same. For example, suppose 2.21429 and 2.21431 are two successive estimates for a zero of
f(x) = x3 −4x −2. Since these two estimates agree to the third digit after the decimal point, we
probably have at least 3 decimal places correct.
There is a problem with this, however. Suppose we are estimating a root whose true value is
1, and the estimates are converging to the value from below—say, 0.985, 0.991, 0.997 and so on.
In this case, not even the ﬁrst decimal place is “correct,” even though the difference between the
estimates and the actual answer is very small—much less than 0.1. To avoid this difﬁculty, we say
that an estimate a for some quantity r is accurate to p decimal places if the error, which is the
absolute value of the difference between a and r, or |r −a|, is as follows:
Accuracy to p decimal places
means
Error less than

This is the same as saying that r must lie in an interval of length twice the maximum error,
centered on a. For example, if a is accurate to 1 decimal place, r must lie in the following interval:
a −0.05
a
a + 0.05
Since both the graphing calculator and the bisection method give us an interval in which the
root is trapped, this deﬁnition of decimal accuracy is a natural one for these processes.

so 22/7 is accurate to two decimal places. Finally,
|3.14 −3.1415 . . .| = 0.0015 . . . < 0.005,
so 3.14 is accurate to two decimal places.
Warning:
• Saying that an approximation is accurate to, say, 2 decimal places does not guarantee that its
ﬁrst two decimal places are “correct,” that is, that the two digits of the approximation are the
same as the corresponding two digits in the true value. For example, an approximate value of
5.997 is accurate to 2 decimal places if the true value is 6.001, but neither of the 9s in the
approximation agrees with the 0s in the true value (nor does the digit 5 agree with the digit 6).
• When ﬁnding a root r of an equation, the number of decimal places of accuracy refers to the
number of digits that have stabilized in the root. It does not refer to the number of digits of
f(r) that are zero. For example, Table A.1 on page 1098 shows that x = 2.2 is a root of
f(x) = x3 −4x −2 = 0, accurate to one decimal place. Yet, f(2.2) = −0.152, so f(2.2)
does not have one zero after the decimal point. Similarly, x = 2.21 is the root accurate to two
decimal places, but f(2.21) = −0.046 does not have two zeros after the decimal point.
Example 8
Is x = 2.2143 a zero of f(x) = x3 −4x −2 accurate to four decimal places?
Solution
We want to know whether r, the exact value of the zero, lies in the interval
2.2143 −0.00005 < r < 2.2143 + 0.00005
which is the same as
2.21425 < r < 2.21435.
Since f(2.21425) < 0 and f(2.21435) > 0, the zero does lie in this interval, and so r = 2.2143 is
accurate to four decimal places.
How to Write a Decimal Answer
The graphing calculator and bisection method naturally give an interval for a root or a zero. How-
ever, other numerical techniques do not give a pair of numbers bounding the true value, but rather a
single number near the true value. What should you do if you want a single number, rather than an
interval, for an answer? In general, averaging the endpoint of the interval is the best solution.
When giving a single number as an answer and interpreting it, be careful about giving rounded
answers. For example, suppose you know a root lies in the interval between 0.81 and 0.87. Averag-
ing gives 0.84 as a single number estimating the root. But it would be wrong to round 0.84 to 0.8 and
say that the answer is 0.8 accurate to one decimal place; the true value could be 0.86, which is not
within 0.05 of 0.8. The right thing to say is that the answer is 0.84 accurate to one decimal place.
Similarly, to give an answer accurate to, say, 2 decimal places, you may have to show 3 decimal
places in your answer.
Bounds of a Function
Knowing how big or how small a function gets can sometimes be useful, especially when you can’t
easily ﬁnd exact values of the function. You can say, for example, that sin x always stays between
−1 and 1 and that 2 sin x + 10 always stays between 8 and 12. But 2x is not conﬁned between any
two numbers, because 2x will exceed any number you can name if x is large enough. We say that
sin x and 2 sin x + 10 are bounded functions, and that 2x is an unbounded function.

1102
Appendix A
A function f is bounded on an interval if there are numbers L and U such that
L ≤f(x) ≤U
for all x in the interval. Otherwise, f is unbounded on the interval.
We say that L is a lower bound for f on the interval, and that U is an upper bound for f on
the interval.
Example 9
Use Figures A.7 and A.8 to decide which of the following functions are bounded.
(a) x3 on −∞< x < ∞; on 0 ≤x ≤100.
(b) 2/x on 0 < x < ∞; on 1 ≤x < ∞.

2/x

Figure A.8: Is 2/x bounded?
Solution
(a) The graph of x3 in Figure A.7 shows that x3 will exceed any number, no matter how large, if x is
big enough, so x3 does not have an upper bound on −∞< x < ∞. Therefore, x3 is unbounded
on −∞< x < ∞. But on the interval 0 ≤x ≤100, x3 stays between 0 (a lower bound) and
1003 = 1,000,000 (an upper bound). Therefore, x3 is bounded on the interval 0 ≤x ≤100.
Notice that upper and lower bounds, when they exist, are not unique. For example, −100 is
another lower bound and 2,000,000 another upper bound for x3 on 0 ≤x ≤100.
(b) 2/x is unbounded on 0 < x < ∞, since it has no upper bound on that interval. But 0 ≤2/x ≤2
for 1 ≤x < ∞, so 2/x is bounded, with lower bound 0 and upper bound 2, on 1 ≤x < ∞.
(See Figure A.8.)
Best Possible Bounds
Consider a group of people whose height in feet, h, ranges from 5 feet to 6 feet. Then 5 feet is a
lower bound for the people in the group and 6 feet is an upper bound:
5 ≤h ≤6.
But the people in this group are also all between 4 feet and 7 feet, so it is also true that
4 ≤h ≤7.
So, there are many lower bounds and many upper bounds. However, the 5 and the 6 are considered
the best bounds because they are the closest together of all the possible pairs of bounds.
The best possible bounds for a function, f, over an interval are numbers A and B such that,
for all x in the interval,
A ≤f(x) ≤B
and where A and B are as close together as possible. A is called the greatest lower bound
and B is the least upper bound.

COMPLEX NUMBERS
The quadratic equation
x2 −2x + 2 = 0
is not satisﬁed by any real number x. If you try applying the quadratic formula, you get
x = 2 ± √4 −8
2
= 1 ±
√−4
2
.
Apparently, you need to take a square root of −4. But −4 does not have a square root, at least, not
one which is a real number. Let’s give it a square root.
We deﬁne the imaginary number i to be a number such that
i2 = −1.
Using this i, we see that (2i)2 = −4, so

Appendix B
1105
x = 1 ±
√−4
2
= 1 ± 2i
2 = 1 ± i.
This solves our quadratic equation. The numbers 1 + i and 1 −i are examples of complex numbers.
A complex number is deﬁned as any number that can be written in the form
z = a + bi,
where a and b are real numbers and i2 = −1, so we say i = √−1.
The real part of z is the number a; the imaginary part is the number b.
Calling the number i imaginary makes it sound as if i does not exist in the same way that real
numbers exist. In some cases, it is useful to make such a distinction between real and imaginary
numbers. For example, if we measure mass or position, we want our answers to be real numbers.
But the imaginary numbers are just as legitimate mathematically as the real numbers are.
As an analogy, consider the distinction between positive and negative numbers. Originally,
people thought of numbers only as tools to count with; their concept of “ﬁve” or “ten” was not far
removed from “ﬁve arrows” or “ten stones.” They were unaware that negative numbers existed at all.
When negative numbers were introduced, they were viewed only as a device for solving equations
like x + 2 = 1. They were considered “false numbers,” or, in Latin, “negative numbers.” Thus,
even though people started to use negative numbers, they did not view them as existing in the same
way that positive numbers did. An early mathematician might have reasoned: “The number 5 exists
because I can have 5 dollars in my hand. But how can I have −5 dollars in my hand?” Today we
have an answer: “I have −5 dollars” means I owe somebody 5 dollars. We have realized that negative
numbers are just as useful as positive ones, and it turns out that complex numbers are useful too.
For example, they are used in studying wave motion in electric circuits.
Algebra of Complex Numbers
Numbers such as 0, 1, 1
2, π, and
√
2 are called purely real because they contain no imaginary
components. Numbers such as i, 2i, and
√
2i are called purely imaginary because they contain only
the number i multiplied by a nonzero real coefﬁcient.
Two complex numbers are called conjugates if their real parts are equal and if their imaginary
parts are opposites. The complex conjugate of the complex number z = a + bi is denoted z, so we
have
z = a −bi.
(Note that z is real if and only if z = z.) Complex conjugates have the following remarkable
property: if f(x) is any polynomial with real coefﬁcients (x3 +1, say) and f(z) = 0, then f(z) = 0.
This means that if z is the solution to a polynomial equation with real coefﬁcients, then so is z.
• Two complex numbers are equal if and only if their real parts are equal and their imaginary
parts are equal. Consequently, if a + bi = c + di, then a = c and b = d.
• Adding two complex numbers is done by adding real and imaginary parts separately:
(a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i.
• Subtracting is similar:
(a + bi) −(c + di) = (a −c) + (b −d)i.
• Multiplication works just as for polynomials, using i2 = −1:
(a + bi)(c + di) = a(c + di) + bi(c + di)
= ac + adi + bci + bdi2
= ac + adi + bci −bd = (ac −bd) + (ad + bc)i.

1106
Appendix B
• Powers of i: We know that i2 = −1; then i3 = i · i2 = −i, and i4 = (i2)2 = (−1)2 = 1. Then
i5 = i · i4 = i, and so on. Thus we have

• The product of a number and its conjugate is always real and nonnegative:
z · z = (a + bi)(a −bi) = a2 −abi + abi −b2i2 = a2 + b2.
• Dividing by a nonzero complex number is done by multiplying the denominator by its conju-
gate, thereby making the denominator real:
a + bi
c + di = a + bi
c + di · c −di
c −di = ac −adi + bci −bdi2

The Complex Plane and Polar Coordinates
It is often useful to picture a complex number z = x + iy in the plane, with x along the horizontal
axis and y along the vertical. The xy-plane is then called the complex plane. Figure B.11 shows the
complex numbers −2i, 1 + i, and −2 + 3i.

The triangle in Figure B.12 shows that a complex number can be written using polar coordinates
as follows:
z = x + iy = r cos θ + ir sin θ.

Appendix B
1107
Example 3
Express z = −2i and z = −2 + 3i using polar coordinates. (See Figure B.11.)
Solution
For z = −2i, the distance of z from the origin is 2, so r = 2. Also, one value for θ is θ = 3π/2.
Using polar coordinates, −2i = 2 cos(3π/2) + i 2(sin 3π/2).
For z = −2 + 3i, we have x = −2, y = 3. So r =

(−2)2 + 32 ≈3.61, and one solution of
tan θ = 3/(−2) with θ in quadrant II is θ ≈2.16. So −2 + 3i ≈3.61 cos(2.16) + i 3.61 sin(2.16).
Example 4
Consider the point with polar coordinates r = 5 and θ = 3π/4. What complex number does this
point represent?

Since x = r cos θ and y = r sin θ we see that x = 5 cos 3π/4 = −5/

Derivatives and Integrals of Complex-Valued Functions
Suppose z(t) = x(t) + iy(t), where t is real, then we deﬁne z′(t) and

z (t) dt by treating i like
any other constant:
z′(t) = x′(t) + iy′(t)

z (t) dt =

x (t) dt + i

y (t) dt.
With these deﬁnitions, all the usual properties of differentiation and integration hold, such as

z′ (t) dt = z (t) + C,
for C is a complex constant.
Euler’s Formula
Consider the complex number z lying on the unit circle in Figure B.13. Writing z in polar coordi-
nates, and using the fact that r = 1, we have
z = f(θ) = cos θ + i sin θ.
It turns out that there is a particularly beautiful and compact way of rewriting f(θ) using com-
plex exponentials. We take the derivative of f using the fact that i2 = −1:
f ′(θ) = −sin θ + i cosθ = i cosθ + i2 sin θ.
Factoring out an i gives
f ′(θ) = i(cos θ + i sin θ) = i · f(θ).
As you know from Chapter 11, page 610, the only real-valued function whose derivative is propor-
tional to the function itself is the exponential function. In other words, we know that if
g′(x) = k · g(x),
then
g(x) = Cekx
z = cos θ + i sin θ

for some constant C. If we assume that a similar result holds for complex-valued functions, then we
have
f ′(θ) = i · f(θ),
so
f(θ) = Ceiθ
for some constant C. To ﬁnd C we substitute θ = 0. Now f(0) = Cei·0 = C, and since f(0) =
cos 0 + i sin 0 = 1, we must have C = 1. Therefore f(θ) = eiθ. Thus we have
Euler’s formula
eiθ = cos θ + i sin θ.
This elegant and surprising relationship was discovered by the Swiss mathematician Leonhard
Euler in the eighteenth century, and it is particularly useful in solving second-order differential
equations. Another way of obtaining Euler’s formula (using Taylor series) is given in Problem 46 on
page 551. It allows us to write the complex number represented by the point with polar coordinates
(r, θ) in the following form:
z = r(cos θ + i sin θ) = reiθ.
Similarly, since cos(−θ) = cos θ and sin(−θ) = −sin θ, we have
re−iθ = r (cos(−θ) + i sin(−θ)) = r(cos θ −i sin θ).
Example 5
Evaluate eiπ.
Solution
Using Euler’s formula, eiπ = cos π + i sin π = −1.
Example 6
Express the complex number represented by the point r = 8, θ = 3π/4 in Cartesian form and polar
form, z = reiθ.

Using polar coordinates, we have
z = 8ei 3π/4.
The polar form of complex numbers makes ﬁnding powers and roots of complex numbers much
easier. Writing z = reiθ, we ﬁnd any power of z as follows:
zp = (reiθ)p = rpeipθ.
To ﬁnd roots, we let p be a fraction, as in the following example.
Example 7
Find a cube root of the complex number represented by the point with polar coordinates (8, 3π/4).

In Example 6, we saw that this complex number could be written as z = 8ei3π/4. So,
3√z =

Using Complex Exponentials
Euler’s formula, together with the fact that exponential functions are simple to manipulate, allows
us to obtain many results about trigonometric functions easily.
The following example uses the fact that for complex z, the function ez has all the usual alge-
braic properties of exponents.
Example 8
Use Euler’s formula to obtain the double-angle identities
cos 2θ = cos2 θ −sin2 θ
and
sin 2θ = 2 cos θ sin θ.
Solution
We use the fact that e2iθ = eiθ · eiθ. This can be rewritten as
cos 2θ + i sin 2θ = (cos θ + i sin θ)2.
Multiplying out (cos θ + i sin θ)2, using the fact that i2 = −1 gives
cos 2θ + i sin 2θ = cos2 θ −sin2 θ + i(2 cosθ sin θ).
Since two complex numbers are equal only if the real and imaginary parts are equal, we must have
cos 2θ = cos2 θ −sin2 θ
and
sin 2θ = 2 cos θ sin θ.
If we solve eiθ = cos θ + i sin θ and e−iθ = cos θ −i sin θ for sin θ and cos θ, we obtain
sin θ = eiθ −e−iθ
2i
and
cos θ = eiθ + e−iθ
2
.
By differentiating the formula eikθ = cos(kθ) + i sin(kθ), for θ real and k a real constant, it can be
shown that
d

Thus complex exponentials are differentiated and integrated just like real exponentials.

NEWTON’S METHOD
Many problems in mathematics involve ﬁnding the root of an equation. For example, we might have
to locate the zeros of a polynomial, or determine the point of intersection of two curves. Here we
will see a numerical method for approximating solutions which cannot be calculated exactly.
One such method, bisection, is described in Appendix A. Although it is very simple, the bisec-
tion method has two major drawbacks. First, it cannot locate a root where the curve is tangent to,
but does not cross, the x-axis. Second, it is relatively slow in the sense that it requires a considerable
number of iterations to achieve a desired level of accuracy. Although speed may not be important
in solving a single equation, a practical problem may involve solving thousands of equations as a
parameter changes. In such a case, any reduction in the number of steps can be important.

1112
Appendix C
Using Newton’s Method
We now consider a powerful root-ﬁnding method developed by Newton. Suppose we have a function
y = f(x). The equation f(x) = 0 has a root at x = r, as shown in Figure C.14. We begin with an
initial estimate, x0, for this root. (This can be a guess.) We will now obtain a better estimate x1. To
do this, construct the tangent line to the graph of f at the point x = x0, and extend it until it crosses
the x-axis, as shown in Figure C.14. The point where it crosses the axis is usually much closer to r,
and we use that point as the next estimate, x1. Having found x1, we now repeat the process starting
with x1 instead of x0. We construct a tangent line to the curve at x = x1, extend it until it crosses
the x-axis, use that x-intercept as the next approximation, x2, and so on. The resulting sequence of
x-intercepts usually converges rapidly to the root r.
Let’s see how this looks algebraically. We know that the slope of the tangent line at the initial
estimate x0 is f ′(x0), and so the equation of the tangent line is
y −f(x0) = f ′(x0)(x −x0).
At the point where this tangent line crosses the x-axis, we have y = 0 and x = x1, so that
0 −f(x0) = f ′(x0)(x1 −x0).
Solving for x1, we obtain
x1 = x0 −f(x0)
f ′(x0)
provided that f ′(x0) is not zero. We now repeat this argument and ﬁnd that the next approximation
is
x2 = x1 −f(x1)
f ′(x1).
Summarizing, for any n = 0, 1, 2, . . . , we obtain the following result.
Newton’s Method to Solve the Equation f(x) = 0
Choose x0 near a solution and compute the sequence x1, x2, x3 . . . using the rule
xn+1 = xn −f(xn)
f ′(xn)
provided that f ′(xn) is not zero. For large n, the solution is well approximated by xn.

Example 1
Use Newton’s method to ﬁnd the ﬁfth root of 23. (By calculator, this is 1.872171231, correct to nine
decimal places.)
Solution
To use Newton’s method, we need an equation of the form f(x) = 0 having 231/5 as a root. Since
231/5 is a root of x5 = 23 or x5 −23 = 0, we take f(x) = x5 −23. The root of this equation is

Appendix C
1113
between 1 and 2 (since 15 = 1 and 25 = 32), so we will choose x0 = 2 as our initial estimate. Now
f ′(x) = 5x4, so we can set up Newton’s method as
xn+1 = xn −x5
n −23
5x4n
.
In this case, we can simplify using a common denominator, to obtain
xn+1 = 4x5
n + 23
5x4n
.
Therefore, starting with x0 = 2, we ﬁnd that x1 = 1.8875. This leads to x2 = 1.872418193
and x3 = 1.872171296. These values are in Table C.4. Since we have f(1.872171231) > 0 and
f(1.872171230) < 0, the root lies between 1.872171230 and 1.872171231. Therefore, in just four
iterations of Newton’s method, we have achieved eight-decimal accuracy.

As a general guideline for Newton’s method, once the ﬁrst correct decimal place is found, each
successive iteration approximately doubles the number of correct digits.
What happens if we select a very poor initial estimate? In the preceding example, suppose x0
were 10 instead of 2. The results are in Table C.5. Notice that even with x0 = 10, the sequence of
values moves reasonably quickly toward the solution: We achieve six-decimal place accuracy by the
eleventh iteration.
Example 2
Find the ﬁrst point of intersection of the curves given by f(x) = sin x and g(x) = e−x.
Solution
The graphs in Figure C.15 make it clear that there are an inﬁnite number of points of intersection,
all with x > 0. In order to ﬁnd the ﬁrst one numerically, we consider the function
F(x) = f(x) −g(x) = sin x −e−x
whose derivative is F ′(x) = cos x + e−x. From the graph, we see that the point we want is fairly
close to x = 0, so we start with x0 = 0. The values in Table C.6 are approximations to the root.
Since F(0.588532744) > 0 and F(0.588532743) < 0, the root lies between 0.588532743 and
0.588532744. (Remember, your calculator must be set in radians.)

When Does Newton’s Method Fail?
In most practical situations, Newton’s method works well. Occasionally, however, the sequence x0,
x1, x2, . . . fails to converge or fails to converge to the root you want. Sometimes, for example, the
sequence can jump from one root to another. This is particularly likely to happen if the magnitude
of the derivative f ′(xn) is small for some xn. In this case, the tangent line is nearly horizontal and
so xn+1 will be far from xn. (See Figure C.16.)
If the equation f(x) = 0 has no root, then the sequence will not converge. In fact, the sequence
obtained by applying Newton’s method to f(x) = 1 + x2 is one of the best known examples of
chaotic behavior and has attracted considerable research interest recently. (See Figure C.17.)

VECTORS IN THE PLANE
Position Vectors
Consider a point (a, b) lying on a curve C in the plane (see Figure D.18). The arrow from the
origin to the point (a, b) is called the position vector of the point, written ⃗r . As the point moves

along the curve, the position vector sweeps across the plane, the arrowhead touching the curve (see
Figure D.19).
A position vector is deﬁned by its magnitude (or length) and its direction. Figure D.20 shows
two position vectors with the same magnitude but different directions. Figure D.21 shows two posi-
tion vectors with the same direction but different magnitudes. An object that possesses both magni-
tude and direction is called a vector, and a position vector is one example. Other physical quantities
(such as force, electric and magnetic ﬁelds, velocity and acceleration) that have both magnitude and
direction can be represented by vectors. To distinguish them from vectors, real numbers (which have
magnitude but no direction) are sometimes called scalars.
Vectors can be written in several ways. One is to write ⟨a, b⟩for the position vector with tip at
(a, b)— the use of the angle brackets signiﬁes that we’re talking about a vector, not a point. Another
notation uses the special vectors⃗i and ⃗j along the axes. The position vector⃗i points to (1, 0) and
⃗j points to (0, 1); both have magnitude 1. The position vector ⃗r pointing to (a, b) can be written
⃗r = a⃗i + b⃗j .
The terms a⃗i and b⃗j are called the components of the vector.
Other special vectors include the zero vector, ⃗0 = 0⃗i + 0⃗j . Any vector with magnitude 1 is
called a unit vector.

||⃗r || = ||a⃗i + b⃗j || =

The direction of a position vector ⃗r = a⃗i + b⃗j is given by the angle θ between the vector and the

Describing Motion with Position Vectors
The motion given by the parametric equations
x = f(t), y = g(t)
can be represented by a changing position vector
⃗r (t) = f(t)⃗i + g(t)⃗j .
For example, ⃗r (t) = cos t⃗i + sin t⃗j represents the motion x = cos t, y = sin t around the unit
circle.
Displacement Vectors
Position vectors are vectors that begin at the origin. More general vectors can start at any point in
the plane. We view such an arrow as an instruction to move from one point to another and call it
a displacement vector. Figure D.25 shows the same displacement vector starting at two different
points; we say they are the same vector since they have the same direction and magnitude. Thus, a
position vector ⃗r is a displacement vector beginning at the origin. The zero vector ⃗0 = 0⃗i + 0⃗j
represents no displacement at all.

The sum ⃗u 1 + ⃗u 2 of two displacement vectors is the result of displacing an object ﬁrst by ⃗u 1 and
then by ⃗u 2; see Figure D.26. In terms of components:
If ⃗u 1 = a1⃗i + b1⃗j and ⃗u 2 = a2⃗i + b2⃗j , then the sum is
⃗u 1 + ⃗u 2 = (a1 + a2)⃗i + (b1 + b2)⃗j .
In other words, to add vectors, add their components separately.

Solution
(a) (3⃗i + 2⃗j ) + (−⃗i +⃗j ) = 2⃗i + 3⃗j
(b) (⃗i + 0⃗j ) + (3⃗i +⃗j ) = 4⃗i +⃗j
(c) (⃗i + 0⃗j ) + (0⃗i +⃗j ) =⃗i +⃗j .
Vectors can be multiplied by a number. This operation is called scalar multiplication because
it represents changing (“scaling”) the magnitude of a vector while keeping its direction the same or
reversing it. See Figure D.27.
If c is a real number and ⃗u = a⃗i + b⃗j , then the scalar multiple of ⃗u by c, c⃗u , is
c⃗u = ca⃗i + cb⃗j .
In other words, to multiply a vector by a scalar c, multiply each component by c.

Solution
We have
6⃗u 2 = 6⃗i + 18⃗j ,
(−2)⃗u 1 = −4⃗i ,
2⃗u 1 + 5⃗u 2 = (4⃗i ) + (5⃗i + 15⃗j ) = 9⃗i + 15⃗j .
Velocity Vectors
For a particle moving along a line with position s(t), the instantaneous velocity is ds/dt. For a
particle moving in the plane, the velocity is a vector. If the position vector is ⃗r (t) = x(t)⃗i + y(t)⃗j ,
the particle’s displacement during a time interval Δt is
Δ⃗r (t) = Δx⃗i + Δy⃗j .

Appendix D
1119
Dividing by Δt and letting Δt →0, we get the following result:
For motion in the plane with position vector ⃗r (t) = x(t)⃗i + y(t)⃗j , the velocity vector is
⃗v (t) = dx
dt
⃗i + dy
dt
⃗j .
The direction of ⃗v (t) is tangent to the curve. The magnitude ||⃗v (t)|| is the speed.
Notice the vector viewpoint agrees with the formulas for speed, vx and vy, given in Section 4.8, so
we write
⃗v (t) = vx⃗i + vy⃗j .
Recall that for motion on a line, the acceleration is a = dv/dt = d2s/dt2. For motion in the plane,
we have the following:
If the position vector is ⃗r (t) = x(t)⃗i + y(t)⃗j , the acceleration vector is
⃗a (t) = d2x
dt2⃗i + d2y
dt2 ⃗j .
The acceleration measures both change in speed and change in direction of the velocity
vector.

Let ⃗r (t) = cos(2t)⃗i + sin(2t)⃗j . Find the
(a)
Velocity
(b)

Solution
(a) Differentiating ⃗r (t) gives the velocity vector
Velocity = ⃗v (t) = −2 sin(2t)⃗i + 2 cos(2t)⃗j .
(b) Finding the magnitude of ⃗v (t), we have
Speed = ||⃗v (t)|| =

(−2 sin(2t))2 + (2 cos(2t))2 = 2.
Notice that the speed is constant.
(c) Differentiating ⃗v (t) gives the acceleration vector
Acceleration = ⃗a (t) = −4 cos(2t)⃗i −4 sin(2t)⃗j .
Notice that even though the speed is constant, the acceleration vector is not⃗0 , since the velocity
vector is changing direction.

DETERMINANTS
We introduce the determinant of an array of numbers. Each 2 by 2 array of numbers has another
number associated with it, called its determinant, which is given by

 = a1b2 −a2b1.
For example


 = 2(−6) −5(−4) = 8.
Each 3 by 3 array of numbers also has a number associated with it, also called a determinant,
which is deﬁned in terms of 2 by 2 determinants as follows:

a1 a2 a3

Notice that the determinant of the 2 by 2 array multiplied by ai is the determinant of the array found
by removing the row and column containing ai. Also, note the minus sign in the second term. An

Suppose the vectors⃗a and⃗b have components⃗a = a1⃗i +a2⃗j +a3⃗k and⃗b = b1⃗i +b2⃗j +b3⃗k .
Recall that the cross product ⃗a ×⃗b is given by the expression
⃗a ×⃗b = (a2b3 −a3b2)⃗i + (a3b1 −a1b3)⃗j + (a1b2 −a2b1)⃗k .
Notice that if we expand the following determinant, we get the cross product:

Determinants give a useful way of computing cross products.

Linear functions (p. 4) have the form
y = f(x) = b+ mx,
where m is the slope, or rate of change of y with respect to x
(p. 5) and b is the vertical intercept, or value of y when x is
zero (p. 5). The slope is

Exponential functions have the form P = P0at (p. 13) or
P = P0ekt (p. 16), where P0 is the initial quantity (p. 13),
a is the growth (decay) factor per unit time (p. 13), |k| is the
continuous growth (decay) rate (pp. 16, 610), and r = |a−1|
is the growth (decay) rate per unit time (p. 14).
Suppose P0 > 0. If a > 1 or k > 0, we have exponen-
tial growth; if 0 < a < 1 or k < 0, we have exponential
decay (p. 15). The doubling time (for growth) is the time re-
quired for P to double (p. 14). The half-life (for decay) is
the time required for P to be reduced by a factor of one half
(p. 14). The continuous growth rate k = ln(1 + r) is slightly
less than, but very close to, r, provided r is small (p. 611).

Operations on Functions
Shifts, Stretches, and Composition Multiplying by a con-
stant, c, stretches (if c > 1) or shrinks (if 0 < c < 1) the
graph vertically. A negative sign (if c < 0) reﬂects the graph
about the x-axis, in addition to shrinking or stretching (p. 21).
Replacing y by (y −k) moves a graph up by k (down if k is
negative) (p. 21). Replacing x by (x−h) moves a graph to the
right by h (to the left if h is negative) (p. 21). The composite
of f and g is the function f(g(x)); f is the outside function,
g the inside function (p. 21).
Symmetry We say f is an even function if f(−x) = f(x)
(p. 22) and f is an odd function if f(−x) = −f(x) (p. 22).
Inverse Functions A function f has an inverse if (and only
if) its graph intersects any horizontal line at most once (p. 24).
If f has an inverse, it is written f −1, and f −1(x) = y means
f(y) = x (p. 24). Provided the x and y scales are equal, the
graph of f −1 is the reﬂection of the graph of f about the line
y = x (p. 25).
Proportionality We say y is proportional to x if y = kx for
k a nonzero constant. We say y is inversely proportional to x
if y = k(1/x) (p. 6).
Limits and Continuity
Idea of Limit (p. 58) If there is a number L such that f(x) is
as close to L as we please whenever x is sufﬁciently close to
c (but x ̸= c), then limx→c f(x) = L.
Deﬁnition of Limit (p. 59) If there is a number L such
that for any ϵ > 0, there exists a δ > 0 such that if |x−c| < δ
and x ̸= c, then |f(x) −L| < ϵ, then limx→c f(x) = L.
One-sided Limits (p. 61) If f(x) approaches L
as x approaches c through values greater than c, then
limx→c+ f(x) = L. If f(x) approaches L as x approaches
c through values less than c, then limx→c−f(x) = L.
Limits at Inﬁnity (p. 63) If f(x) gets as close to L as we
please when x gets sufﬁciently large, then limx→∞f(x) =
L. Similarly, if f(x) approaches L as x gets more and more
negative, then limx→−∞f(x) = L.

Idea of Continuity (p. 53) A function is continuous on
an interval if its graph has no breaks, jumps, or holes in that
interval.
Deﬁnition of Continuity (p. 63) The function f is con-
tinuous at x = c if f is deﬁned at x = c and
lim
x→c f(x) = f(c).

READY REFERENCE

The function is continuous on an interval if it is continuous
at every point in the interval.
Theorem: Continuity of Sums, Products, Quotients
(p. 64) Suppose that f and g are continuous on an interval and
that b is a constant. Then, on that same interval, the following
functions are also continuous: bf(x), f(x)+g(x), f(x)g(x).
Further, f(x)/g(x) is continuous provided g(x) ̸= 0 on the
interval.
Theorem: Continuity of Composite Functions (p. 64)
Suppose f and g are continuous and f(g(x)) is deﬁned on an
interval. Then on that interval f(g(x)) is continuous.
Intermediate Value Theorem (p. 55) Suppose f is con-
tinuous on a closed interval [a, b]. If k is any number between
f(a) and f(b), then there is at least one number c in [a, b]
such that f(c) = k.
The Extreme Value Theorem (p. 196) If f is continu-
ous on the interval [a, b], then f has a global maximum and a
global minimum on that interval.
The Derivative
The slope of the secant line of f(x) over an interval [a, b]

and gives the instantaneous rate of change of f at a (p. 83).

(p. 99). If f ′ > 0
on an interval, then f is increasing over that interval (p. 92).
If f ′ < 0 on an interval, then f is decreasing over that inter-
val (p. 92). If f ′′ > 0 on an interval, then f is concave up
over that interval (p. 104). If f ′′ < 0 on an interval, then f is
concave down over that interval (p. 104).
The tangent line at (a, f(a)) is the graph of y = f(a)+
f ′(a)(x−a) (p. 169). The tangent line approximation says
that for values of x near a, f(x) ≈f(a) + f ′(a)(x −a). The
expression f(a) + f ′(a)(x −a) is called the local lineariza-
tion of f near x = a (p. 169).

Applications of the Derivative
A function f has a local maximum at p if f(p) is greater than
or equal to the values of f at points near p, and a local min-
imum at p if f(p) is less than or equal to the values of f at
points near p (p. 187). It has a global maximum at p if f(p)
is greater than or equal to the value of f at any point in the
interval, and a global minimum at p if f(p) is less than or
equal to the value of f at any point in the interval (p. 196).
A critical point of a function f(x) is a point p in the
domain of f where f ′(p) = 0 or f ′(p) is undeﬁned (p. 187).
Theorem: Local maxima and minima which do not oc-
cur at endpoints of the domain occur at critical points (pp. 188,
192).
The First-Derivative Test for Local Maxima and Min-
ima (p. 188):
• If f ′ changes from negative to positive at p, then f has a
local minimum at p.
• If f ′ changes from positive to negative at p, then f has a
local maximum at p.
The Second-Derivative Test for Local Maxima and
Minima (p. 189):
• If f ′(p) = 0 and f ′′(p) > 0
then
f has a local mini-
mum at p.
• If f ′(p) = 0 and f ′′(p) < 0
then
f has a local maxi-
mum at p.
• If f ′(p) = 0 and f ′′(p) = 0
then
the test tells us
nothing.
To ﬁnd the global maximum and minimum of a func-
tion on an interval we compare values of f at all critical
points in the interval and at the endpoints of the interval (or
lim
x→±∞f(x) if the interval is unbounded) (p. 197).
An inﬂection point of f is a point at which the graph of
f changes concavity (p. 190); f ′′ is zero or undeﬁned at an
inﬂection point (p. 190).
L’Hopital’s rule (p. 243) If f and g are continuous,
f(a) = g(a) = 0, and g′(a) ̸= 0, then
lim
x→a
f(x)
g(x) = f ′(a)
g′(a) .
Parametric equations (p. 249) If a curve is given by the
parametric equations x = f(t), y = g(t), the slope of the
curve as a function of t is dy/dx = (dy/dt)/(dx/dt).
Theorems About Derivatives
Theorem: Local Extrema and Critical Points (pp. 188,
192) Suppose f is deﬁned on an interval and has a local maxi-
mum or minimum at the point x = a, which is not an endpoint
of the interval. If f is differentiable at x = a, then f ′(a) = 0.
The Mean Value Theorem (p. 175) If f is continuous
on [a, b] and differentiable on (a, b), then there exists a num-
ber c, with a < c < b, such that
f ′(c) = f(b) −f(a)
b −a
.
The Increasing Function Theorem (p. 176) Suppose
that f is continuous on [a, b] and differentiable on (a, b).
• If f ′(x) > 0 on (a, b), then f is increasing on [a, b].
• If f ′(x) ≥0 on (a, b), then f is nondecreasing on [a, b].

that f is continuous on [a, b] and differentiable on (a, b). If

Antiderivatives
An antiderivative of a function f(x) is a function F(x) such
that F ′(x) = f(x) (p. 320). There are inﬁnitely many an-
tiderivatives of f since F(x) + C is an antiderivative of
f for any constant C, provided F ′(x) = f(x) (p. 320).
The indeﬁnite integral of f is the family of antiderivatives

f(x) dx = F(x) + C (p. 326).

Applications of Integration
Total quantities can be approximated by slicing them into
small pieces and summing the pieces. The limit of this sum
is a deﬁnite integral which gives the exact total quantity.

To calculate the volume of a solid, slice the volume into pieces
whose volumes you can estimate (pp. 414, 422). Use this
method to calculate volumes of revolution (p. 422) and vol-

Sequences and Series
A sequence s1, s2, s3, . . . , sn, . . . has a limit L, written
lim
n→∞sn = L, if we can make sn as close to L as we please
by choosing a sufﬁciently large n. The sequence converges if
a limit exists, diverges if no limit exists (see p. 494). Limits
of sequences satisfy the same properties as limits of functions
stated in Theorem 1.2 (p. 60) and
lim
n→∞xn = 0
if |x| < 1
lim
n→∞1/n = 0
(p. 494)
A sequence sn is bounded if there are constants K and
M such that K ≤sn ≤M for all n (p. 494). A convergent
sequence is bounded. A sequence is monotone if it is either
increasing, that is sn < sn+1 for all n, or decreasing, that is
sn > sn+1 for all n (p. 495).
Theorem: Convergence of a Monotone, Bounded Se-
quence (p. 495): If a sequence sn is bounded and monotone,
it converges.
A series is an inﬁnite sum  
an = a1 + a2 + · · ·. The
nth partial sum is Sn = a1 + a2 + · · · + an (p. 505). If
S = lim
n→∞Sn exists, then the series  
an converges, and its
sum is S (p. 505). If a series does not converge, we say that
it diverges (p. 505). The sum of a ﬁnite geometric series is
(p. 500):
a + ax + ax2 + · · · + axn−1 = a(1 −xn)

The sum of an inﬁnite geometric series is (p. 501):

The p-series  
1/np converges if p > 1 and diverges
if p ≤1 (p. 509). The harmonic series  
1/n diverges
(p. 507), the alternating harmonic series  
(−1)n−1(1/n)
converges (p. 517). An alternating series can be absolutely
or conditionally convergent (p. 518).

change the value of its sum if it does converge.

Differential Equations
A differential equation for the function y(x) is an equation
involving x, y and the derivatives of y (p. 586). The order of
a differential equation is the order of the highest-order deriva-
tive appearing in the equation (p. 588). A solution to a dif-
ferential equation is any function y that satisﬁes the equation
(p. 587). The general solution to a differential equation is the
family of functions that satisﬁes the equation (p. 587). An
initial value problem is a differential equation together with
an initial condition; a solution to an initial value problem is
called a particular solution (p. 587). An equilibrium solu-
tion to a differential equation is a particular solution where y
is constant and dy/dx = 0 (p. 615).
First-order equations: methods of solution. A slope ﬁeld
corresponding to a differential equation is a plot in the xy-
plane of small line segments with slope given by the differ-
ential equation (p. 591). Euler’s method approximates the
solution of an initial value problem with a string of small
line segments (p. 599). Differential equations of the form
dy/dx = g(x)f(y) can be solved analytically by separation
of variables (p. 604).

First-order equations: applications. The differential equa-
tion for exponential growth and decay is of the form
dP
dt = kP.
The solution is of the form P = P0ekt, where P0 is the initial
value of P, and positive k represents growth while negative k
represents decay (p. 610). Applications of growth and decay
include continuously compounded interest (p. 610), popu-
lation growth (p. 629), and Newton’s law of heating and
cooling (p. 613). The logistic equation for population growth

Solutions can be visualized as trajectories in the wr-phase
plane (p. 644). An equilibrium point is one at which
dw/dt = 0 and dr/dt = 0 (p. 644). A nullcline is a curve
along which dw/dt = 0 or dr/dt = 0 (p. 650).
Multivariable Functions
Points in 3-space are represented by a system of Cartesian
coordinates (p. 668). The distance between (x, y, z) and
(a, b, c) is

(x −a)2 + (y −b)2 + (z −c)2 (p. 671).
Functions of two variables can be represented by graphs
(p. 674), contour diagrams (p. 681), cross-sections (p. 676),
and tables (p. 667).
Functions of three variables can be represented by the
family of level surfaces f(x, y, z) = c for various values of
the constant c (p. 700).
A linear function f(x, y) has equation
f(x, y) = z0 + m(x −x0) + n(y −y0) (p. 694)
= c + mx + ny, where c = z0 −mx0 −ny0.
Its graph is a plane with slope m in the x-direction, slope n
in the y-direction, through (x0, y0, z0) (p. 694). Its table of
values has linear rows (of same slope) and linear columns (of
same slope) (p. 695). Its contour diagram is equally spaced
parallel straight lines (p. 696).
The
limit
of
f
at
the
point
(a, b),
written
lim(x,y)→(a,b) f(x, y), is the number L, if one exists, such
that f(x, y) is as close to L as we please whenever the dis-
tance from the point (x, y) to the point (a, b) is sufﬁciently
small, but not zero. (p. 707).
A function f is continuous at the point (a, b) if
lim(x,y)→(a,b) f(x, y) = f(a, b). A function is continuous
on a region R if it is continuous at each point of R (p. 707).
Vectors
A vector ⃗v has magnitude (denoted ∥⃗v ∥) and direction. Ex-
amples are displacement vectors (p. 718), velocity and ac-
celeration vectors (pp. 727, 728). and force (p. 728). We can
add vectors, and multiply a vector by a scalar (p. 719). Two
non-zero vectors, ⃗v and ⃗w , are parallel if one is a scalar mul-
tiple of the other (p. 720).
A unit vector has magnitude 1. The vectors ⃗i , ⃗j , and
⃗k are unit vectors in the directions of the coordinate axes.
A unit vector in the direction of any nonzero vector ⃗v is
⃗u = ⃗v /∥⃗v ∥(p. 724). We resolve ⃗v into components by
writing ⃗v = v1⃗i + v2⃗j + v3⃗k (p. 721).
If ⃗v = v1⃗i + v2⃗j + v3⃗k and ⃗w = w1⃗i + w2⃗j + w3⃗k

Differentiation of Multivariable Functions
Partial derivatives of f (p. 759).

fy(a, b) =
Rate of change of f with respect to y
at the point (a, b)
= lim
h→0
f(a, b + h) −f(a, b)
h
.
On the graph of f, the partial derivatives fx(a, b) and
fy(a, b) give the slope in the x and y directions, respectively
(p. 760). The tangent plane to z = f(x, y) at (a, b) is
z = f(a, b) + fx(a, b)(x −a) + fy(a, b)(y −b)
(p. 772).
Partial derivatives can be estimated from a contour diagram or
table of values using difference quotients (p. 760), and can be
computed algebraically using the same rules of differentiation
as for one-variable calculus (p. 766). Partial derivatives for
functions of three or more variables are deﬁned and computed
in the same way (p 767).
The gradient vector grad f of f
is grad f(a, b)
=
fx(a, b)⃗i

(p.

or
grad f(a, b, c) = fx(a, b, c)⃗i + fy(a, b, c)⃗j + fz(a, b, c)⃗k
(3 variables) (p. 789). The gradient vector at P: Points in the
direction of increasing f; is perpendicular to the level curve
or level surface of f through P; and has magnitude ∥grad f∥
equal to the maximum rate of change of f at P (pp. 783, 790).
The magnitude is large when the level curves or surfaces are
close together and small when they are far apart.
The directional derivative of f at P in the direction of
a unit vector ⃗u is (pp. 780, 782)
f⃗u (P) =
Rate of change
of f in direction
of ⃗u at P
= grad f(P) · ⃗u
The tangent plane approximation to f(x, y) for (x, y)
near the point (a, b) is
f(x, y) ≈f(a, b) + fx(a, b)(x −a) + fy(a, b)(y −b).
The right-hand side is the local linearization (p. 773). The
differential of z = f(x, y) at (a, b) is the linear function of
dx and dy
df = fx(a, b) dx + fy(a, b) dy
(p. 775).
Local linearity with three or more variables follows the same
pattern as for functions of two variables (p. 775).
The tangent plane to a level surface of a function of
three-variables f at (a, b, c) is (p. 792)
fx(a, b, c)(x−a)+fy(a, b, c)(y−b)+fz(a, b, c)(z−c) = 0.
The Chain Rule for the partial derivative of one variable with
respect to another in a chain of composed functions (p. 799):
• Draw a diagram expressing the relationship between the
variables, and label each link in the diagram with the
derivative relating the variables at its ends.
• For each path between the two variables, multiply to-
gether the derivatives from each step along the path.
• Add the contributions from each path.

Deﬁnition of Differentiability (p. 815). A function f(x, y)

tion L(x, y) = f(a, b) + m(x −a) + n(y −b) such that if
the error E(x, y) is deﬁned by

Theorem: Continuity of Partial Derivatives Implies
Differentiability (p. 819). If the partial derivatives, fx and
fy, of a function f exist and are continuous on a small disk
centered at the point (a, b), then f is differentiable at (a, b).
Optimization
A function f has a local maximum at the point P0 if f(P0) ≥
f(P) for all points P near P0, and a local minimum at
the point P0 if f(P0) ≤f(P) for all points P near P0
(p. 830). A critical point of a function f is a point where
grad f is either ⃗0 or undeﬁned. If f has a local maximum or
minimum at a point P0, not on the boundary of its domain,
then P0 is a critical point (p. 830). A quadratic function
f(x, y) = ax2 + bxy + cz2 generally has one critical point,
which can be a local maximum, a local minimum, or a saddle
point (p. 833).
Second derivative test for functions of two vari-
ables (p. 835). Suppose grad f(x0, y0) = ⃗0 . Let D =
fxx(x0, y0)fyy(x0, y0) −(fxy(x0, y0))2.
• If D > 0 and fxx(x0, y0) > 0, then f has a local mini-
mum at (x0, y0).
• If D > 0 and fxx(x0, y0) < 0, then f has a local maxi-
mum at (x0, y0).
• If D < 0, then f has a saddle point at (x0, y0).
• If D = 0, anything can happen.
Unconstrained optimization
A function f deﬁned on a region R has a global maximum on
R at the point P0 if f(P0) ≥f(P) for all points P in R, and
a global minimum on R at the point P0 if f(P0) ≤f(P) for
all points P in R (p. 839). For an unconstrained optimiza-
tion problem, ﬁnd the critical points and investigate whether
the critical points give global maxima or minima (p. 839).
A closed region is one which contains its boundary; a
bounded region is one which does not stretch to inﬁnity in
any direction (p. 844).
Extreme Value Theorem for Multivariable Functions.
If f is a continuous function on a closed and bounded region
R, then f has a global maximum at some point (x0, y0) in R
and a global minimum at some point (x1, y1) in R (p. 845).
Constrained optimization
Suppose P0 is a point satisfying the constraint g(x, y) = c.
A function f has a local maximum at P0 subject to the con-
straint if f(P0) ≥f(P) for all points P near P0 satisfying
the constraint (p. 850). It has a global maximum at P0 sub-
ject to the constraint if f(P0) ≥f(P) for all points P sat-
isfying the constraint (p. 850). Local and global minima are
deﬁned similarly (p. 850). A local maximum or minimum of
f(x, y) subject to a constraint g(x, y) = c occurs at a point
where the constraint is tangent to a level curve of f, and thus
where grad g is parallel to grad f (p. 850).
To optimize f subject to the constraint g = c (p. 850),
ﬁnd the points satisfying the equations
grad f = λ grad g
and
g = c.
Then compare values of f at these points, at points on the
constraint where grad g = ⃗0 , and at the endpoints of the con-
straint. The number λ is called the Lagrange multiplier.
To optimize f subject to the constraint g ≤c (p. 852),
ﬁnd all points in the interior g(x, y) < c where grad f is zero
or undeﬁned; then use Lagrange multipliers to ﬁnd the local
extrema of f on the boundary g(x, y) = c. Evaluate f at the
points found and compare the values.
The value of λ is the rate of change of the optimum value
of f as c increases (where g(x,y) = c) (p. 853). The La-
grangian function L(x, y, λ) = f(x, y) −λ(g(x, y) −c)
can be used to convert a constrained optimization problem for
f subject the constraint g = c into an unconstrained problem
for L (p. 854).
Multivariable Integration
The deﬁnite integral of f, a continuous function of two vari-
ables, over R, the rectangle a ≤x ≤b, c ≤y ≤d, is called
a double integral, and is a limit of Riemann sums

f dA =

The Riemann sum is constructed by subdividing R into sub-
rectangles of width Δx and height Δy, and choosing a point
(uij, vij) in the ij-th rectangle.
A triple integral of f, a continuous function of three
variables, over W , the box a ≤x ≤b, c ≤y ≤d, p ≤z ≤q
in 3-space, is deﬁned in a similar way using three-variable
Riemann sums (p. 885).

the variables in the integrals further out (pp. 879, 887).
Integrals in other coordinate systems
When computing double integrals in polar coordinates, put
dA = r dr dθ or dA = r dθ dr (p. 891). Cylindrical coor-
dinates are given by x = r cos θ, y = r sin θ, z = z, for
0 ≤r < ∞, 0 ≤θ ≤2π, −∞< z < ∞(p. 896). Spherical
coordinates are given by x = ρ sin φ cos θ, y = ρ sin φ sin θ,
z = ρ cos φ, for 0 ≤ρ < ∞, 0 ≤φ ≤π, 0 ≤θ ≤2π
(p. 899). When computing triple integrals in cylindrical or
spherical coordinates, put dV = r dr dθ dz for cylindrical
coordinates (p. 897), dV = ρ2 sin φ dρ dφ dθ for spherical
coordinates (p. 900). Other orders of integration are also pos-
sible.

Parameterizations and Vector Fields
Parameterized curves
The motion of a particle is described by parametric equa-
tions x = f(t), y = g(t) (2-space) or x = f(t), y =
g(t), z = h(t) (3-space). The path of the particle is a param-
eterized curve (p. 918). Parameterizations are also written in
vector form ⃗r (t) = f(t)⃗i + g(t)⃗j + h(t)⃗k (p. 919). For a
curve segment we restrict the parameter to to a closed inter-
val a ≤t ≤b (p. 921). Parametric equations for the graph
of y = f(x) are x = t, y = f(t).
Parametric equations for a line through (x0, y0) in the
direction of ⃗v = a⃗i + b⃗j are x = x0 + at, y = y0 + bt.
In 3-space, the line through (x0, y0, z0) in the direction of
⃗v
= a⃗i + b⃗j + c⃗k is x = x0 + at, y = y0 + bt,
z = z0 + ct (p. 919). In vector form, the equation for a line is
⃗r (t) = ⃗r 0 + t⃗v , where ⃗r 0 = x0⃗i + y0⃗j + z0⃗k (p. 921).
Parametric equations for a circle of radius R in the
plane, centered at the origin are x = R cos t , y = R sin t
(counterclockwise), x = R cos t, y = −R sin t (clockwise).
To ﬁnd the intersection points of a curve ⃗r (t)

f(t)⃗i + g(t)⃗j + h(t)⃗k with a surface F(x, y, z) = c, solve
F(f(t), g(t), h(t)) = c for t (p. 921). To ﬁnd the intersection
points of two curves ⃗r 1(t) and ⃗r 2(t), solve ⃗r 1(t1) = ⃗r 2(t2)
for t1 and t2 (p. 921).

Vector ﬁelds
A vector ﬁeld in 2-space is a function ⃗F (x, y) whose value at
a point (x, y) is a 2-dimensional vector (p. 937). Similarly, a
vector ﬁeld in 3-space is a function ⃗F (x, y, z) whose values
are 3-dimensional vectors (p. 937). Examples are the gradi-
ent of a differentiable function f , the velocity ﬁeld of a ﬂuid
ﬂow, and force ﬁelds (p. 937). A ﬂow line of a vector ﬁeld
⃗v = ⃗F (⃗r ) is a path ⃗r (t) whose velocity vector equals ⃗v ,
thus ⃗r ′(t) = ⃗v = ⃗F (⃗r (t)) (p. 944). The ﬂow of a vector

ﬁeld is the family of all of its ﬂow line (p. 944). Flow lines can
be approximated numerically using Euler’s method (p. 946).
Parameterized surfaces
We parameterize a surface with two parameters, x
=
f1(s, t), y = f2(s, t), z = f3(s, t) (p. 1076). We also use
the vector form ⃗r (s, t) = f1(s, t)⃗i + f2(s, t)⃗j + f3(s, t)⃗k
(p. 1076). Parametric equations for the graph of z =
f(x, y) are x = s, y = t, and z = f(s, t) (p. 1076). Para-
metric equation for a plane through the point with posi-
tion vector ⃗r 0 and containing the two nonparallel vectors ⃗v 1
and ⃗v 2 is ⃗r (s, t) = ⃗r 0 + s⃗v 1 + t⃗v 2 (p. 1077). Paramet-
ric equation for a sphere of radius R centered at the ori-
gin is ⃗r (θ, φ) = R sin φ cos θ⃗i + R sin φ sin θ⃗j + cos φ⃗k ,
0 ≤θ ≤2π, 0 ≤φ ≤π (p. 1077). Parametric equa-
tion for a cylinder of radius R along the z-axis is ⃗r (θ, z) =
R cos θ⃗i + R sin θ⃗j + z⃗k , 0 ≤θ ≤2π, −∞< z < ∞
(p. 1075). A parameter curve is the curve obtained by hold-
ing one of the parameters constant and letting the other vary
(p. 1081).


C ⃗F · d⃗r has the same value along any piecewise smooth
path C from P to Q lying in the domain of ⃗F (p. 976). A gra-
dient ﬁeld is a vector ﬁeld of the form ⃗F = grad f for some
scalar function f, and f is called a potential function for the
vector ﬁeld ⃗F (p. 978). A vector ﬁeld ⃗F is path-independent
if and only if ⃗F is a gradient vector ﬁeld (p. 978). A vector
ﬁeld ⃗F is path-independent if and only if 
C ⃗F · d⃗r = 0 for

A surface is oriented if a unit normal vector ⃗n has been cho-
sen at every point on it in a continuous way (p. 1006). For
a closed surface, we usually choose the outward orientation
(p. 1006). The area vector of a ﬂat, oriented surface is a vec-
tor ⃗A whose magnitude is the area of the surface, and whose
direction is the direction of the orientation vector ⃗n (p. 1007).
If ⃗v is the velocity vector of a constant ﬂuid ﬂow and ⃗A is
the area vector of a ﬂat surface, then the total ﬂow through the
surface in units of volume per unit time is called the ﬂux of ⃗v
through the surface and is given by ⃗v · ⃗A (p. 1007).
The surface integral or ﬂux integral of the vector ﬁeld ⃗F
through the oriented surface S is

S
⃗F · d ⃗A =
lim
∥Δ ⃗
A ∥→0
 ⃗F · Δ ⃗A ,
where the direction of Δ ⃗A is the direction of the orientation
(p. 1008). If ⃗v is a variable vector ﬁeld and then 
S ⃗v · d ⃗A is
the ﬂux through the surface S (p. 1009).
Simple ﬂux integrals can be calculated by putting d ⃗A =
⃗n dA and using geometry or converting to a double integral
(p. 1010).
The ﬂux through a graph of z = f(x, y) above a region
R in the xy-plane, oriented upward, is

Divergence and Curl
Divergence
Deﬁnition of Divergence (p. 1025).
Geometric deﬁnition: The divergence of ⃗F is
div ⃗F (x, y, z) =
lim
Volume→0

S ⃗F · d ⃗A
Volume of S .
Here S is a sphere centered at (x, y, z), oriented out-
wards, that contracts down to (x, y, z) in the limit.
Cartesian coordinate deﬁnition: If ⃗F
= F1⃗i +
F2⃗j + F3⃗k , then
div ⃗F = ∂F1
∂x + ∂F2
∂y + ∂F3
∂z .
The divergence can be thought of as the outﬂow per unit vol-
ume of the vector ﬁeld. A vector ﬁeld ⃗F is said to be diver-
gence free or solenoidal if div ⃗F = 0 everywhere that ⃗F is
deﬁned. Magnetic ﬁelds are divergence free (p. 1028).
The Divergence Theorem (p. 1035). If W is a solid region
whose boundary S is a piecewise smooth surface, and if ⃗F is
a smooth vector ﬁeld which is deﬁned everywhere in W and
on S, then

S
⃗F · d ⃗A =

W
div ⃗F dV,
where S is given the outward orientation. In words, the Diver-
gence Theorem says that the total ﬂux out of a closed surface
is the integral of the ﬂux density over the volume it encloses.
Curl
The circulation density of a smooth vector ﬁeld ⃗F
at
(x, y, z) around the direction of the unit vector ⃗n is deﬁned
to be
circ⃗n ⃗F (x, y, z) =
lim
Area→0
Circulation around C
Area inside C
=
lim
Area→0

C
⃗F · d⃗r
Area inside C
(p. 1048).
Circulation density is calculated using the right-hand rule
(p. 1048).
Deﬁnition of curl (p. 1049).
Geometric deﬁnition The curl of ⃗F , written curl ⃗F ,
is the vector ﬁeld with the following properties
• The direction of curl ⃗F (x, y, z) is the direction
⃗n for which circ⃗n (x, y, z) is greatest.
• The magnitude of curl ⃗F (x, y, z) is the circula-
tion density of ⃗F around that direction.
Cartesian coordinate deﬁnition If ⃗F
= F1⃗i +
F2⃗j + F3⃗k , then
curl ⃗F =

∂F1
∂z −∂F3

∂x −∂F1
∂y

⃗k .
Curl and circulation density are related by circ⃗n ⃗F
=
curl ⃗F · ⃗n (p. 1051). A vector ﬁeld is said to be curl free
or irrotational if curl ⃗F = ⃗0 everywhere that ⃗F is deﬁned
(p. 1052).
Given an oriented surface S with a boundary curve C
we use the right-hand rule to determine the orientation of C
(p. 1056).
Stokes’ Theorem (p. 1057). If S is a smooth oriented surface
with piecewise smooth, oriented boundary C, and if ⃗F is a
smooth vector ﬁeld which is deﬁned on S and C, then

C
⃗F · d⃗r =

S
curl ⃗F · d ⃗A .
Stokes’ Theorem says that the total circulation around C is
the integral over S of the circulation density. A curl ﬁeld is a
vector ﬁeld ⃗F that can be written as ⃗F = curl ⃗G for some
vector ﬁeld ⃗G , called a vector potential for ⃗F (p. 1059).

Relation between divergence, gradient, and curl
The curl and gradient are related by curl grad f
=
0
(p. 1063). Divergence and curl are related by div curl ⃗F = 0
(p. 1064).
The curl test for vector ﬁelds in 3-space (p. 1063) Sup-
pose that curl ⃗F
= ⃗0 , and that the domain of ⃗F has the
property that every closed curve in it can be contracted to a
point in a smooth way, staying at all times within the domain.
Then ⃗F is path-independent, so ⃗F is a gradient ﬁeld and has
a potential function.
The divergence test for vector ﬁelds in 3-space
(p. 1064) Suppose that div ⃗F = 0, and that the domain of ⃗F
has the property that every closed surface in it is the boundary
of a solid region completely contained in the domain. Then ⃗F
is a curl ﬁeld.

sinm x cosn x dx: If m is odd, let w = cos x. If n is odd, let w = sin x. If both m and n are even and
positive, convert all to sin x or all to cos x (using sin2 x + cos2 x = 1), and use IV-17 or IV-18. If m and n
are even and one of them is negative, convert to whichever function is in the denominator and use IV-19 or
IV-21. If both m and n are even and negative, substitute w = tan x, which converts the integrand to a rational
function that can be integrated by the method of partial fractions.
