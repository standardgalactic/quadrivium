The picture on the cover represents the lattice of subgroups of the Smarandache loop L15(8). 
The lattice of subgroups of the commutative loop L15(8) is a non-modular lattice with 22 
elements. This is a Smarandache loop which satisfies the Smarandache Lagrange criteria. 
But for the Smarandache concepts one wouldn't have studied the collection of subgroups of 
a loop.

PREFACE 
 
 
 
The theory of loops (groups without associativity), though researched by several 
mathematicians has not found a sound expression, for books, be it research level or 
otherwise, solely dealing with the properties of loops are absent. This is in marked 
contrast with group theory where books are abundantly available for all levels: as 
graduate texts and as advanced research books.  
 
The only three books available where the theory of loops are dealt with are: R. H. 
Bruck, A Survey of Binary Systems, Springer Verlag, 1958 recent edition (1971); H. 
O. Pflugfelder, Quasigroups and Loops: Introduction, Heldermann Verlag, 1990; 
Orin Chein, H. O. Pflugfelder and J.D.H. Smith (editors), Quasigroups and Loops: 
Theory and Applications, Heldermann Verlag, 1990. But none of them are 
completely devoted for the study of loops.  
 
The author of this book has been working in loops for the past 12 years, and has 
guided a Ph.D. and 3 post-graduate research projects in this field of loops feels that 
the main reason for the absence of books on loops is the fact that it is more abstract 
than groups. Further one is not in a position to give a class of loops which are as 
concrete as the groups of the form Sn, D2n etc. which makes the study of these non-
associative structures much more complicated. To overcome this problem in 1994 
the author with her Ph.D. student S. V. Singh has introduced a new class of loops 
using modulo integers. They serve as a concrete examples of loops of even order and 
it finds an application to colouring of the edges of the graph K2n.  
 
Several researchers like Bruck R. H., Chibuka V. O., Doro S., Giordano G., 
Glauberman G., Kunen K., Liebeck M.W.,  Mark P., Michael Kinyon, Orin Chein, Paige 
L.J., Pflugfelder H.O., Phillips J.D., Robinson D. A., Solarin A. R. T., Tim Hsu, Wright 
C.R.B. and by others who have worked on Moufang loops and other loops like Bol 
loops, A-loops, Steiner loops and Bruck loops. But some of these loops become 
Moufang loops. Orin Chein, Michael Kinyon and others have studied loops and the 
Lagrange property.  
 
The purpose of this book entirely lies in the study, introduction and examination of 
the Smarandache loops based on a paper about Special Algebraic Structures by 
Florentin Smarandache. As a result, this book doesn't give a full-fledged analysis on 
loops and their properties. However, for the sake of readers who are involved in the 
study of loop theory we have provided a wide-ranging list of papers in the reference. 
We expect the reader to have a good background in algebra and more specifically a 
strong foundation in loops and number theory.

This book introduces over 75 Smarandache concepts on loops, and most of these 
concepts are illustrated by examples. In fact several of the Smarandache loops have 
classes of loops which satisfy the Smarandache notions.  
 
This book is structured into five chapters. Chapter one which is introductory in nature 
covers some notions about groups, graphs and lattices. Chapter two gives some basic 
properties of loops. The importance of this chapter lies in the introduction of a new 
class of loops of even order. We prove that the number of different representations of 
right alternative loop of even order (2n), in which square of each element is identity 
is equal to the number of distinct proper (2n – 1) edge colourings of the complete 
graph K2n.  
 
In chapter three we introduce Smarandache loops and their Smarandache notions. 
Except for the Smarandache notions several of the properties like Lagrange's criteria, 
Sylow's criteria may not have been possible. Chapter four introduces Smarandache 
mixed direct product of loops which enables us to define a Smarandache loops of 
level II and this class of loops given by Smarandache mixed direct product gives more 
concrete and non-abstract structure of Smarandache loops in general and loops in 
particular. The final section gives 52 research problems for the researchers in order 
to make them involved in the study of Smarandache loops. The list of problems 
provided at the end of each section is a main feature of this book.  
 
I deeply acknowledge the encouragement that Dr. Minh Perez extended to me during 
the course of this book. It was because of him that I got started in this endeavour of 
writing research books on Smarandache algebraic notions.  
 
I dedicate this book to my parents, Worathur Balasubramanian and Krishnaveni for 
their love.

Chapter one 
GENERAL FUNDAMENTALS 
 
In this chapter we shall recall some of the basic concepts used in this book to make it 
self-contained. As the reader is expected to have a good knowledge in algebra we have 
not done complete justice in recollecting all notions. This chapter has three sections. 
In the first section we just give the basic concepts or notion like equivalence relation 
greatest common divisor etc. Second section is devoted to giving the definition of 
group and just stating some of the classical theorems in groups like Lagrange's, 
Cauchy's etc. and some basic ideas about conjugates. Further in this section one 
example of a complete graph is described as we obtain an application of loops to the 
edge colouring problem of the graph K2n. In third section we have just given the 
definition of lattices and its properties to see the form of the collection of subgroups 
in loops, subloops in loops and normal subloops in loops. The subgroups in case of 
Smarandache loops in general do not form a modular lattice.  
 
Almost all the proofs of the theorem are given as exercise to the reader so that the 
reader by solving them would become familiar with these concepts. 
 
 
1.1 Basic Concepts 
 
The main aim of this section is to introduce the basic concepts of equivalence 
relation, equivalence class and introduce some number theoretic results used in this 
book. Wherever possible the definition when very abstract are illustrated by examples. 
 
DEFINITION 1.1.1: If a and b are integers both not zero, then an integer d is 
called the greatest common divisor of a and b if  
 
i. 
d > 0 
ii. 
d is a common divisor of a and b and 
iii. 
if any integer f is a common divisor of both a and b then f is also a 
divisor of d.  
 
The greatest common divisor of a and b is denoted by g.c.d (a, b) or simply 
(g.c.d). If a and b are relatively prime then (a, b) = 1. 
 
DEFINITION 1.1.2: The least common multiple of two positive integers a and b 
is defined to be the smallest positive integer that is divisible by a and b and it is 
denoted by l.c.m or [a, b]. 
 

 
8 
DEFINITION 1.1.3: Any function whose domain is some subset of set of 
integers is called an arithmetic function. 
 
DEFINITION 1.1.4: An arithmetic function f(n) is said to be a multiplicative 
function if f(mn) = f(m) f(n) whenever (m, n) = 1. 
 
Notation: If x ∈ R (R the set of reals), Then [x] denotes the largest integer that does 
not exceed x. 
 
Result 1: If d = (a, c) then the congruence ax ≡ b (mod c) has no solution if d /  b 
and it has d mutually incongruent solutions if d/b. 
 
Result 2: ax ≡ b (mod c) has a unique solution if (a, c) = 1. 
 
 
1.2 A few properties of groups and graphs 
 
In this section we just recall the definition of groups and its properties, and state the 
famous classical theorems of Lagrange and Sylow. The proofs are left as exercises for 
the reader. 
 
DEFINITION 1.2.1: A non-empty set of elements G is said to form a group if on 
G is defined a binary operation, called the product and denoted by ' • ' such that 
 
1. a, b ∈ G implies a • b ∈ G (closure property). 
2. a, b, c ∈ G implies a • (b • c) = (a • b) • c (associative law). 
3. There exist an element e ∈ G such that a • e = e • a = a for all a ∈ G (the 
existence of identity element in G). 
4. For every a ∈ G there exists an element a
-1 ∈ G such that a • a
-1 = a
-1 • a = 
e (the existence of inverse element in G) 
 
DEFINITION 1.2.2: A group G is said to be abelian (or commutative) if for 
every a, b ∈ G, a • b = b • a. 
 
A group which is not commutative is called non-commutative. The number of 
elements in a group G is called the order of G denoted by o(G) or |G|. The number is 
most interesting when it is finite, in this case we say G is a finite group. 
 
DEFINITION 1.2.3: Let G be a group. If a, b ∈ G, then b is said to be a 
conjugate of a in G if there is an element c ∈ G such that b= c
-1ac. We denote a 
conjugate to b by a ~ b and we shall refer to this relation as conjugacy relation 
on G. 
 

 
9 
DEFINITION 1.2.4: Let G be a group. For a ∈ G define N(a) = {x ∈ G | ax = 
xa}. N(a) is called the normalizer of a in G. 
 
THEOREM(Cauchy's Theorem For Groups): Suppose G is a finite group and 
p/o(G), where p is a prime number, then there is an element a ≠ e ∈ G such that 
a
p = e, where e is the identity element of the group G. 
 
DEFINITION 1.2.5: Let G be a finite group. Then  
 
∑
=
))

(
N
(o
)
G
(o
)
G
(o
 
 
where this sum runs over one element a in each conjugate class, is called the 
class equation of the group G. 
 
DEFINITION 1.2.6: Let X = (a1, a2, … , an). The set of all one to one mappings 
of the set X to itself under the composition of mappings is a group, called the 
group of permutations or the symmetric group of degree n. It is denoted by Sn and 
Sn has n! elements in it.  
 
A permutation σ of the set X is a cycle of length n if there exists a1, a2, …, an ∈ X 
such that a1 σ = a2, a2 σ = a3, … , an-1 σ = an and an σ = a1 that is in short

 A cycle of length 2 is a transposition. Cycles are disjoint, if there is no element in 
common. 
 
Result: Every permutation σ of a finite set X is a product of disjoint cycles. 
 
The representation of a permutation as a product of disjoint cycles, none of which is 
the identity permutation, is unique up to the order of the cycles. 
 
DEFINITION 1.2.7: A permutation with k1 cycles of length 1, k2 cycles of length 
2 and so on, kn cycles of length n is said to be a cycle class (k1, k2, … , kn). 
 
THEOREM (Lagrange's): If G is a finite group and H is a subgroup of G, then 
o(H) is a divisor of o(G).  
 
The proof of this theorem is left to the reader as an exercise. 
 

 
10 
It is important to point out that the converse to Lagrange's theorem is false-a group G 
need not have a subgroup of order m if m is a divisor of o(G). For instance, a finite 
group of order 12 exists which has no subgroup of order 6. Consider the symmetric 
group S4 of degree 4, which has the alternating subgroup A4, of order 12. It is easily 
established 6/12 but A4 has no subgroup of order 6; it has only subgroups of order 2, 
3 and 4. 
 
We also recall Sylow's theorems which are a sort of partial converse to Lagrange's 
theorem. 
 
THEOREM (First Part of Sylow's theorem): If p is a prime number and 
pα/o(G), where G is a finite group, then G has a subgroup of order pα.  
 
The proof is left as an exercise for the reader. 
 
DEFINITION 1.2.8: Let G be a finite group. A subgroup of G of order p
m, where 
p
m/o(G) but p
m+1 /  o(G) is called a p-Sylow subgroup of G. 
 
THEOREM (Second part of Sylow's Theorem): If G is a finite group, p a 
prime and pα/o (G) but pα+1 /  o(G), then any two subgroups of G of order pα are 
conjugate.  
 
The assertion of this theorem is also left for the reader to verify. 
 
THEOREM (Third part of Sylow's theorem): The number of p-sylow 
subgroups in G, for a given prime is of the from 1 + kp.  
 
Left for the reader to prove. For more about these proofs or definitions kindly refer 
I.N.Herstein [27] or S.Lang [34]. 
 
DEFINITION 1.2.9: A simple graph in which each pair of disjoint vertices are 
joined by an edge is called a complete graph. 
 
Upto isomorphism, there is just one complete graph on n vertices. 
 
Example 1.2.1: Complete graph on 6 vertices that is K6 is given by the following 
figure:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
11 
 
DEFINITION 1.2.10: A edge colouring η of a loopless graph is an G assignment 
of k colour 1, 2, …, k to the edges of the graph G. The colouring η is proper if no 
two adjacent edges have the same colour in the graph G. 
 
For more about colouring problems and graphs please refer [3]. 
 
 
1.3 Lattices and its properties 
 
The study of lattices has become significant, as we know the normal subgroups of a 
group forms a modular lattice. A natural question would be what is the structure of 
the set of normal subloops of a loop? A still more significant question is what is the 
structure of the collection of Smarandache subloops of a loop? A deeper question is 
what is the structure of the collection of all Smarandache normal subloops? It is still a 
varied study to find the lattice structure of the set of all subgroups of a loop as in the 
basic definition of Smarandache loops we insist that all loops should contain 
subgroups to be a Smarandache loop. In view of this we just recall the definition of 
lattice, modular lattice and the distributive lattice and list the basic properties of them.  
 
DEFINITION 1.3.1: Let A and B be non-empty sets. A relation R from A to B is a 
subset of A × B. Relations from A to B are called relations on A, for short. If (a, b) 
∈ R then we write aRb and say that 'a is in relation R to b'. Also, if a is not in 
relation R to b we write 
b
R
a/ . 
 
A relation R on a non-empty set A may have some of the following properties:  
 
R is reflexive if for all a in A we have aRa. 
R is symmetric if for all a and b in A, aRb implies bRa. 
R is antisymmetric if for all a and b in A, aRb and bRa imply a = b. 
R is transitive if for a, b, c in A, aRb and bRc imply aRc. 
 
A relation R on A is an equivalence relation if R is reflexive, symmetric and 
transitive. In this case [a] = {b ∈ A / aRb} is called the equivalence class of a for 
any a ∈ A.  
 
DEFINITION 1.3.2: A relation R on a set A is called a partial order (relation) if 
R is reflexive, anti-symmetric and transitive. In this case (A, R) is called a partial 
ordered set or a poset.  
 
DEFINITION 1.3.3: A partial order relation ≤ on A is called a total order (or 
linear order) if for each a, b ∈ A either a ≤ b  or b ≤ a. (A, ≤) is then called a 
chain, or totally ordered set.  

 
12 
 
DEFINITION 1.3.4: Let (A, ≤) be a poset and B ⊆ A.  
 
i) 
a ∈ A is called a upper bound of B ⇔ ∀ b ∈ B, b ≤ a. 
ii) 
a ∈ A is called a lower bound of B ⇔ ∀ b ∈ B, a ≤ b. 
iii) 
The greatest amongst the lower bounds whenever it exists is called the 
infimum of B, and is denoted by inf B. 
iv) 
The least upper bound of B, whenever it exists is called the supremum 
of B and is denoted by sup B.  
 
DEFINITION 1.3.5: A poset (L, ≤) is called lattice ordered if for every pair x,y of 
elements of L the sup(x, y)and inf(x, y) exist. 
 
DEFINITION 1.3.6: An (algebraic) lattice (L, ∩, ∪) is a non empty set L with 
two binary operations ∩ (meet) and ∪ (join) (also called intersection or 
product and union or sum respectively) which satisfy the following conditions 
for all x, y, z ∈ L.  
 
(L1) x ∩ y = y ∩ x,   
 
 
x ∪ y = y ∪ x 
(L2) x ∩ (y ∩  z) = (x ∩ y) ∩ z,   
x ∪ (y ∪ z) = (x ∪ y) ∪ z. 
(L3) x ∩ (x ∪ y) = x,     
 
 
x ∪ (x ∩ y) = x. 
 
Two applications of (L3) namely x ∩ x = x ∩ (x ∪ (x ∩ x)) = x lead to the 
additional condition (L4) x ∩ x = x, x ∪ x = x. 
 
(L1) is the commutative law 
(L2) is the associative law 
(L3) is the absorption law and  
(L4) is the idempotent law. 
 
DEFINITION 1.3.7: A partial order relation ≤ on A is called a total order (or 
linear order) if for each a, b ∈ A either a ≤ b or b ≤ a. (A, ≤) is then called a 
chain or totally ordered set. A totally ordered set is a lattice ordered set and (A, ≤) 
will be defined as a chain lattice.  
 
DEFINITION 1.3.8: Let L and M be lattices. A mapping f : L → M is called a  
 
i) 
Join homomorphism if x ∪ y = z ⇒ f(x) ∪  f(y) = f(z). 
ii) 
Meet homomorphism if x ∩ y = z ⇒ f(x) ∩ f(y) = f(z). 
iii) 
Order homomorphism if x ≤ y ⇒ f(x) ≤ f(y).  
 

 
13 
f is a homomorphism (or lattice homomorphism) if it is both a join and a meet 
homomorphism. Injective, surjective or bijective lattice homomorphism are 
called lattice monomorphism, epimorphism, isomorphism respectively.  
 
DEFINITION 1.3.9: A non-empty subset S of a lattice L is called a sublattice of 
L, if S is a lattice with respect to the restriction of ∩ and ∪ on L onto S.  
 
Example 1.3.1: Every singleton of a lattice L is a sublattice of L 
 
DEFINITION 1.3.10: A lattice L is called modular if for all x, y, z ∈ L. 
 
(M) x ≤ z ⇒ x ∪ ( y ∩ z) = (x ∪ y) ∩ z  
 
       (modular equation) 
 
Result 1: The lattice is non-modular if even a triple x, y, z ∈ L does not satisfy 
modular equation. This lattice (given below) will be termed as a pentagon lattice.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Result 2: A lattice L is modular if none of its sublattices is isomorphic to a pentagon 
lattice.  
 
DEFINITION 1.3.11: A lattice L is called distributive if either of the following 
conditions hold for all x, y, z in L 
 
x ∪ (y ∩ z) = (x ∪ y) ∩ (x ∪ z) 
x ∩ (y ∪ z) = (x ∩ y) ∪ (x ∩ z)  
      
            (distributive equations) 
 
Result 3: A modular lattice is distributive if and only if none of its sublattices is 
isomorphic to the diamond lattice given by the following diagram 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a 
c 
b 
1 
0 
c 
1 
a 
0

14 
Result 4: A lattice is distributive if and only if none of its sublattices is isomorphic to 
the pentagon or diamond lattice.  
 
For more about lattices the reader is requested to refer Birkhoff[2] and Gratzer [26]. 
 
Result 5: Let G be any group. The set of all normal subgroups of G forms a modular 
lattice. 
 
Result 6: Let G be a group. The subgroup of G in general does not form a modular 
lattice.  
 
It can be easily verified that the 10 subgroups of the alternating group A4 does not 
form a modular lattice.  
 
Result 7: Let Sn be the symmetric group of degree n, n ≥ 5. The normal subgroups of 
Sn forms a 3 element chain lattice.

Chapter two 
LOOPS AND ITS PROPERTIES 
 
This chapter is completely devoted to the introduction of loops and the properties 
enjoyed by them. It has 7 sections. The first section gives the definition of loop and 
explains them with examples. The substructures in loops like subloops, normal 
subloops, associator, commutator etc are dealt in section 2. Special elements are 
introduced and their properties are recalled in section 3. In section 4 we define some 
special types of loops. The representation and isotopes of loops is introduced in 
section 5. Section 6 is completely devoted to the introduction of a new class of loops 
of even order using integers and deriving their properties. Final section deals with the 
applications of these loops to the edge-colouring of the graph K2n.  
 
 
2.1 Definition of loop and examples 
 
We at this juncture like to express that books solely on loops are meagre or absent as, 
R.H.Bruck deals with loops on his book "A Survey of Binary Systems", that too 
published as early as 1958, [6]. Other two books are on "Quasigroups and Loops" 
one by H.O. Pflugfelder, 1990 [50] which is introductory and the other book co-
edited by Orin Chein, H.O. Pflugfelder and J.D. Smith in 1990 [16]. So we felt it 
important to recall almost all the properties and definitions related with loops. As this 
book is on Smarandache loops so, while studying the Smarandache analogous of the 
properties the reader may not be running short of notions and concepts about loops.   
 
DEFINITION 2.1.1: A non-empty set L is said to form a loop, if on L is defined a 
binary operation called the product denoted by '•' such that 
 
a. For all a, b ∈ L we have a • b ∈ L (closure property). 
b. There exists an element e ∈ L such that a • e = e • a = a for all a ∈ L (e is 
called the identity element of L). 
c. For every ordered pair (a, b) ∈ L × L there exists a unique pair (x, y) in L 
such that ax = b and ya = b.  
 
Throughout this book we take L to be a finite loop, unless otherwise we state it 
explicitly, L is an infinite loop. The binary operation '•' in general need not be 
associative on L. We also mention all groups are loops but in general every loop is not 
a group. Thus loops are the more generalized concept of groups.  
 
Example 2.1.1: Let (L, ∗) be a loop of order six given by the following table. This 
loop is a commutative loop but it is not associative.

Clearly (L, ∗) is non-associative as (a4 ∗ a3) ∗ a2 = a4 and a4 ∗ (a3 ∗ a2) = a4 ∗ a5 = a2. 
Thus (a4 ∗ a3) ∗ a2 ≠ a4 ∗ (a3 ∗ a2). 
 
Example 2.1.2: Let L = {e, a, b, c, d} be a loop with the following composition 
table. This loop is non-commutative.

L is non-commutative as a • b ≠ b • a for a • b = c  and b • a = d. It is left for the 
reader as an exercise to verify L is non-associative. 
 
Notation: Let L be a loop. The number of elements in L denoted by o(L) or |L| is the 
order of the loop L.  
 
Example 2.1.3: Let L be a loop of order 8 given by the following table. L = {e, g1, g2, 
g3, g4, g5, g6, g7} under the operation ' • '.

DEFINITION 2.1.2: A loop (L, •) is said to be a commutative loop if for all a, b 
∈ L we have a • b = b • a.  
 
The loops given in examples 2.1.1 and 2.1.3 are commutative loops. If in a loop (L, 
•) we have at least a pair a, b ∈ L such that a • b ≠ b • a then we say (L, •) is a non-
commutative loop.  
 
The loop given in example 2.1.2 is non-commutative. 
 
Example 2.1.4: Now consider the following loop (L, •) given by the table:

We see a special quality of this loop viz. in this loop xy ≠ yx for any x, y ∈ L \ {e} with 
x ≠ y. This is left as an exercise for the reader to verify.

2.2 Substructures in loops 
 
In this section we introduce the concepts of substructures like, subloop, normal 
subloop, commutator subloop, associator subloop, Moufang centre and Nuclei of a 
loop. We recall the definition of these concepts and illustrate them with examples. We 

 
18 
have not proved or recalled any results about them but we have proposed some 
problems at the end of this section for the reader to solve. A new notion called strictly 
non-commutative loop studied by us in 1994 is also introduced in this section. Finally 
the definition of disassociative and power associative loops by R.H.Bruck are given. 
 
DEFINITION 2.2.1: Let L be a loop. A non-empty subset H of L is called a 
subloop of L if H itself is a loop under the operation of L. 
 
Example 2.2.1: Consider the loop L given in example 2.1.3 we see Hi = {e, gi} for    
i = 1, 2, 3, … , 7 are subloops of L. 
 
DEFINITION 2.2.2: Let L be a loop. A subloop H of L is said to be a normal 
subloop of L, if  
 
1. xH = Hx. 
2. (Hx)y = H(xy). 
3. y(xH) = (yx)H  
 
for all x, y ∈ L. 
 
DEFINITION 2.2.3: A loop L is said to be a simple loop if it does not contain 
any non-trivial normal subloop. 
 
Example 2.2.2: The loops given in example 2.1.1 and 2.1.3 are simple loops for it 
is left for the reader to check that these loops do not contain normal subloops, in fact 
both of them contain subloops which are not normal. 
 
DEFINITION 2.2.4: The commutator subloop of a loop L denoted by L' is the 
subloop generated by all of its commutators, that is, 〈{x ∈ L / x = (y, z) for some 
y, z ∈ L}〉 where for A ⊆ L, 〈A〉 denotes the subloop generated by A. 
 
DEFINITION 2.2.5: If x, y and z are elements of a loop L an associator (x, y, z) 
is defined by, (xy)z = (x(yz)) (x, y, z). 
 
DEFINITION 2.2.6: The associator subloop of a loop L (denoted by A(L)) is the 
subloop generated by all of its associators, that is 〈{x ∈ L / x = (a, b, c) for some 
a, b, c ∈ L}〉. 
 
DEFINITION 2.2.7: A loop L is said to be semi alternative if (x, y, z) = (y, z, x) 
for all x, y, z ∈ L, where (x, y, z) denotes the associator of elements x, y, z ∈ L. 
 
DEFINITION 2.2.8: Let L be a loop. The left nucleus Nλ = {a ∈ L / e = (a, x, y) 
for all x, y ∈ L} is a subloop of L. The middle nucleus Nµ = {a ∈ L / e = (x, a, y) 

 
19 
for all x, y ∈ L} is a subloop of L. The right nucleus Nρ = {a ∈ L / e = (x, y, a) for 
all x, y ∈ L} is a subloop of L. 
 
The nucleus N(L) of the loop L is the subloop given by N(L) = Nλ ∩ Nµ ∩ Nρ. 
 
DEFINITION 2.2.9: Let L be a loop, the Moufang center C(L) is the set of all 
elements of the loop L which commute with every element of L, that is,  C(L)  = 
{x ∈ L / xy = yx for all y ∈ L}. 
 
DEFINITION 2.2.10: The centre Z(L) of a loop L is the intersection of the 
nucleus and the Moufang centre, that is Z(L) = C(L) ∩ N(L).  
 
It has been observed by Pflugfelder [50] that N(L) is a subgroup of L and that Z(L) is 
an abelian subgroup of N(L). This has been cross citied by Tim Hsu [63] further he 
defines Normal subloops of a loop L is a different way. 
 
DEFINITION [63]: A normal subloop of a loop L is any subloop of L which is the 
kernel of some homomorphism from L to a loop. 
 
Further Pflugfelder [50] has proved the central subgroup Z(L) of a loop L is normal 
in L. 
 
DEFINITION [63]: Let L be a loop. The centrally derived subloop (or normal 
commutator- associator subloop) of L is defined to be the smallest normal 
subloop L' ⊂ L such that L / L' is an abelian group. Similarly nuclearly derived 
subloop (or normal associator subloop) of L is defined to be the smallest normal 
subloop L1 ⊂ L such that L / L1 is a group. Bruck proves L' and L1 are well defined.  
 
DEFINITION [63]: The Frattini subloop φ(L) of a loop L is defined to be the set 
of all non-generators of L, that is the set of all x ∈ L such that for any subset S of 
L, L = 〈x, S〉 implies L = 〈S〉. Bruck has proved as stated by Tim Hsu φ(L) ⊂ L and 
L / φ(L) is isomorphic to a subgroup of the direct product of groups of prime 
order.  
 
It was observed by Pflugfelder [50] that the Moufang centre C(L) is a loop. 
 
DEFINITION [63]: A p-loop L is said to be small Frattini if φ(L) has order 
dividing p. A small Frattini loop L is said to be central small Frattini if φ(L) ≤ 
Z(L). The interesting result proved by Tim Hsu is. 
 
THEOREM [63]: Every small Frattini Moufang loop is central small Frattini.  
 
The proof is left to the reader. 

 
20 
 
DEFINITION [40]: Let L be a loop. The commutant of L is the set (L) = {a ∈ L / 
ax = xa ∀ x ∈ L}. The centre of L is the set of all a ∈ C(L) such that a • xy = ax • 
y = x • ay = xa • y and xy • a = x • ya for all x, y ∈ L. The centre is a normal 
subloop. The commutant is also known as Moufang Centre in literature. 
 
DEFINITION [39]: A left loop (B, •) is a set B together with a binary operation 
'•' such that (i) for each a ∈ B, the mapping x → a • x is a bijection and (ii) 
there exists a two sided identity 1∈ B satisfying 1 • x = x • 1 = x for every x ∈ B. 
A right loop is defined similarly. A loop is both a right loop and a left loop. 
 
DEFINITION [11] : A loop L is said to have the weak Lagrange property if, for 
each subloop K of L, |K| divides |L|. It has the strong Lagrange property if every 
subloop K of L has the weak Lagrange property. 
 
A loop may have the weak Lagrange property(For more about these notions refer Orin 
Chein et al [11]). 
 
DEFINITION [41]: Let L be a loop. The flexible law FLEX: x • yx = xy • x for all 
x, y ∈ L. If a loop L satisfies left alternative laws that is y • yx = yy • x then LALT. 
L satisfies right alternative laws RALT: x • yy = xy • y. 
 
There is also the inverse property IP (Michael K. Kinyon et al [41] have proved in IP 
loops RALT and LALT are equivalent). 
 
In a loop L, the left and right translations by x ∈ L are defined by yL(x) = xy and 
yR(x) = yx respectively. The multiplication group of L is the permutation group 
on L, Mlt(L)= 〈R(x), L(x): x ∈ L〉 generated by all left and right translations. The 
inner mapping group is the subgroup Mlt1 (L) fixing 1. If L is a group, then 
Mlt1(L) is the group of inner automorphism  of L. In an IP loop, the AAIP implies 
that we can conjugate by J to get L(x)
J = R(x
-1), R(x)
J = L(x
-1) where θ 
J =  J 
-1 θ J 
= J θ J for a permutation θ. If θ is an inner mapping so is θ  
J. 
 
DEFINITION [41]: ARIF loop is an IP loop L with the property θ 
J = θ for all θ ∈ 
Mlt1(L). Equivalently, inner mappings preserve inverses that is (x
-1) θ = (xθ)
-1 for 
all θ ∈ Mlt1(L) and for all x ∈ L. 
 
DEFINITION 2.2.11: A map φ from a loop L to another loop L1 is called a loop 
homomorphism if φ(ab) = φ (a) φ (b) for all a, b ∈ L. 
 

 
21 
DEFINITION [65]: Let L be a loop L is said to be a strictly non-commutative 
loop if xy ≠ yx for any x, y ∈ L (x ≠ y, x ≠ e, y ≠ e where e is the identity element 
of L). 
 
DEFINITION 2.2.12: A loop L is said to be power-associative in the sense that 
every element of L generates an abelian group. 
 
DEFINITION 2.2.13: A loop L is diassociative loop if every pair of elements of L 
generates a subgroup. 
 
Example 2.2.3: Let L be a loop given by the following table:

The nucleus of this loop is just {e}. The left nucleus of L, Nλ(L) = {e}. The Moufang 
centre of the loop L is C(L) = {e}. Thus for this L we see the center is just {e}.  
 
The reader is requested to prove the above facts, which has been already verified by 
the author for this loop L.

2.3 Special identities in loops 
  
In this section we recall several special identities in loops introduced by Bruck, Bol, 
Moufang, Hamiltonian, etc and illustrate them with example whenever possible. As all 
these notions are to be given a Smarandache analogue in the next chapter we have 
tried our level best to give all the identities. 
 
DEFINITION 2.3.1: A loop L is said to be a Moufang loop if it satisfies any one 
of the following identities:  
 
1. (xy) (zx) = (x(yz))x 
2. ((xy)z)y = x(y(zy)) 
3. x(y(xz) = ((xy)x)z  
 
for all x, y, z ∈ L. 
 
DEFINITION 2.3.2: Let L be a loop, L is called a Bruck loop if x(yx)z = x(y(xz)) 
and (xy)
-1 = x
-1y
-1 for all x, y, z ∈ L. 
 
DEFINITION 2.3.3: A loop (L, •) is called a Bol loop if ((xy)z)y = x((yz)y) for 
all x, y, z ∈ L. 
 
DEFINITION 2.3.4: A loop L is said to be right alternative if (xy)y = x(yy) for 
all x, y ∈  L and L is left alternative if (xx)y = x(xy) for all x, y ∈ L. L is said to 
be an alternative loop if it is both a right and left alternative loop. 
 
DEFINITION 2.3.5: A loop (L, •) is called a weak inverse property loop (WIP-
loop) if (xy)z = e imply x(yz) = e for all x, y, z ∈ L. 
 
DEFINITION 2.3.6: A loop L is said to be semi alternative if (x, y, z) = (y, z, x) 
for all x, y, z ∈ L, where (x, y, z) denotes the associator of elements x, y, z ∈ L.  
 
THEOREM (Moufang's theorem): Every Moufang loop G is diassociative more 
generally, if a, b, c are elements in a Moufang loop G such that (ab)c = a(bc) 
then a, b, c generate an associative loop.  
 
The proof is left for the reader; for assistance refer Bruck R.H. [6]. 
 
PROBLEMS: 
 
1. Can a loop of order 5 be a Moufang loop? 
2. Give an example of a strictly non-commutative loop of order 9.

2.4 Special types of loops 
 
In this section we introduce several special types of loops like unique product loop, 
two unique product loop, Hamiltonian loop, diassociative loop, strongly semi right 
commutative loop, inner commutative loop etc. The loops can be of any order finite 
or infinite. Further we recall these definitions and some simple interesting properties 
are given for the deeper understanding of these concepts. Several proofs are left for 
the reader to prove. The concept of unique product groups and two unique product 
groups were introduced in 1941 by Higman [28]. He studied this relative to zero 
divisors in group rings and in fact proved if G is a two unique product group or a 
unique product group then the group ring FG has no zero divisors where F is a field of 
characteristic zero. In 1980 Strojnowski.A [62] proved that in case of groups the 
notion of unique product and two unique product coincide. We introduce the 
definition of unique product (u.p) and two unique product (t.u.p) to loops.  
 
DEFINITION 2.4.1: Let L be a loop, L is said to be a two unique product loop 
(t.u.p) if given any two non-empty finite subsets A and B of L with |A| + |B| > 2 
there exist at least two distinct elements x and y of L that have unique 
representation in the from x = ab and y = cd with a, c ∈ A and b, d ∈ B. 
 
A loop L is called a unique product (u.p) loop if, given A and B two non-empty 
finite subsets of L, then there always exists at least one x ∈ L which has a unique 
representation in the from x = ab, with a ∈ A and b ∈ B.  
 
It is left as an open problem to prove whether the two concepts u.p and t.u.p are one 
and the same in case of loops 
 
DEFINITION 2.4.2: An A-loop is a loop in which every inner mapping is an 
automorphism. 
 
It has been proved by Michael K. Kinyon et al that every diassociative A-loop is a 
Moufang loop. For proof the reader is requested to refer [41, 42]. As the main aim of 
this book is the introduction of Smarandache loops and study their Smarandache 
properties we have only recalled the definition from several authors. A few interesting 
results are given as exercise to the readers. 
 
DEFINITION 2.4.3: A loop L is said to be simple ordered by a binary relation 
(<) provided that for all a, b, c in L  

 
24 
 
(i) 
exactly one of the following holds: a < b, a = b, b < a. 
(ii) 
if a < b and b < c then a < c. 
(iii) if a < b then ac < bc and ca < c b. 
 
The relation a > b is interpreted as usual, to mean b < a. If 1 is the identity 
element of L, an element a is called positive if a > 1, negative if a < 1. This 
notion will find its importance in case of loop rings.  
 
DEFINITION 2.4.4: A loop L is called Hamiltonian if every subloop is normal. 
 
DEFINITION 2.4.5: A loop is power associative (diassociative) if every element 
generates (every two element generate) a subgroup. 
 
DEFINITION 2.4.6: A power associative loop is a p-loop (p a prime) if every 
element has p-power order.  
 
In view of these definitions we have the following theorems. 
 
THEOREM 2.4.1: A power associative Hamiltonian loop in which every element 
has finite order is a direct product of Hamiltonian p-loops.  
 
The proof of the theorem is left for the reader. Refer [6] for more information.  
 
THEOREM 2.4.2: A diassociative Hamiltonian loop G is either an abelian group 
or a direct product G= A ⊗ T ⊗ H where A is an abelian group whose elements 
have finite odd order. T is an abelian group of exponent 2 and H is a non-
commutative loop with the following properties  
 
(i) 
The centre Z= Z(H) has order two element 1, where e ≠1, e
2 = 1.  
(ii) 
If x is a non-central element of H; x
2 = e. 
(iii) If x, y are in H and (x, y) ≠ e and x, y generate a quaternion group. 
(iv) 
If x, y, z are in H and (x, y, z) ≠ 1 then (x, y, z) = e. 
 
The proof is left for the reader and is requested to refer [6]. 
 
Norton [44,45] showed conversely if A, T, H are as specified in the above theorem 
then A ⊗ T ⊗ H is a diassociative Hamiltonian loop. Further more if H satisfies the 
additional hypothesis that any three elements x, y, z for which (x, y, z) =  1 are 
contained in a subgroup then H is either a quaternion group or a Cayley group. We 
define CA-loop, inner commutative loops etc. and prove the following results.  
 

 
25 
DEFINITION 2.4.7: Let L be a loop. An element x ∈ L is called a CA- element in 
L if (ax)b = (xb)a and a(xb) = b(ax) for all a, b ∈ L. A loop L having a CA-
element is called a CA-loop. 
 
DEFINITION 2.4.8: Let L be a loop. L is said to be inner commutative if every 
proper subloop of L is commutative but L is not commutative. We say L is strictly 
inner commutative if every proper subloop of L is commutative but they are not 
cyclic groups. 
 
DEFINITION 2.4.9: Let L be a loop, L is said to be semi right commutative if for 
every pair of elements x, y ∈ L; we can always find an element c ∈ L such that ab 
= c(ba) or (cb)a. 
 
DEFINITION 2.4.10: Let L be a loop if for every triple x, y, z in L at least one of 
the following equality is true: 
 
(i) 
xy = z(yx) or (zy)x 
(ii) 
yz = x(zy) or (xz)y 
(iii) zx = y(xz) or (yx)z 
 
then we call the loop L to be a strongly semi right commutative. 
 
THEOREM 2.4.3: Every strongly semi right commutative loop is commutative. 
 
Proof: Clearly for every triple {1, a, b}, 1, a, b ∈ L; 1 the unit element of L we have ab 
= ba. Hence the claim. 
 
THEOREM 2.4.4: Every commutative loop L in general need not be strongly 
semi right commutative. 
 
Proof: By an example. Consider the loop L = {e, a, b, c, d, g} given by the following 
table; e is the identity element of L. 
 
• 
e 
a 
b 
c 
d 
g

Clearly L is commutative. For the triple a, b, c ∈ L, ab ≠ c (ba) or (cb)a for ab = d 
and c(ba) = cd = a; d ≠ a, hence ab ≠ c(ba). 
 

 
26 
Now (cb)a = ga = c; ab = d ≠ (cb)a = c. So L is not strongly semi right commutative. 
 
THEOREM 2.4.5: Every commutative loop L is semi right commutative. 
 
Proof: Clear from the fact for every pair x, y ∈ L we can choose the identity element e 
of L so that xy = e(yx). 
 
THEOREM 2.4.6: Every semi right commutative loop is not strongly semi right 
commutative. 
 
Proof: The loop L given as an example in Theorem 2.4.4 is commutative, but L is not 
strongly semi right commutative.  
 
We have the following relation 
 
 
Strongly semi right commutative loop 
⇓ 
Commutative loop 
⇓ 
Semi right commutative loop 
 
 
DEFINITION 2.4.11: Let L be a loop. If for a, b ∈ L with ab = ba in L if we have 
(ax)b = (bx)a (or b(xa)) for all x ∈ L then we say the pair a, b is pseudo 
commutative. [we can have a(xb) = (bx)a or b(xa) that is we can take a(xb) 
instead of (ax)b also]. If in L every commutative pair is pseudo commutative 
then we say the loop L is a pseudo commutative loop. If for every distinct pair of 
elements a, b ∈ L we have axb = bxa for all x ∈ L take the associative brackets in 
a way which suits the equality; then the loop is called a strongly pseudo 
commutative loop. Using this concept of pseudo commutativity we now define 
the concept of pseudo commutator of L. 
 
DEFINITION 2.4.12: Let L be a loop. The pseudo commutator of L demoted by 
P(L) = 〈{ p ∈ L / a(xb) = p [(bx)a]}〉 where 〈〉 denotes the set generated by p. 
Similarly we define the strongly pseudo commutator of L denoted by SP(L) = 〈{p 
∈ L / (ax)b = (pb) (ax)}〉. 
 
DEFINITION 2.4.13: Let L be a loop. An associative triple a, b, c ∈ L is said to 
be pseudo associative if (ab) (xc) = (ax) (bc) for all x ∈ L. If (ab) (xc) = (ax) 
(bc) for some x ∈ L we say the triple is pseudo associative relative to those x in L. 
If in particular associative triple is pseudo associative then we say the loop is a 
pseudo associative loop.  

 
27 
 
If in the non-associative loop L if for a non-associative triple a, b, c in L we have 
(ax) (bc) = (ab) (xc) then for all x ∈ L, we say the triple is strongly pseudo 
associative. A loop is strongly pseudo associative if every triple is strongly pseudo 
associative. 
 
DEFINITION 2.4.14: Let L be a loop. PA(L) = 〈{t ∈L / (ab) (tc) = (at) (bc) 
where a(bc) = (ab)c  for a, b, c ∈ L}〉 denotes the pseudo associator of L 
generated by t ∈ L, satisfying the condition given in PA(L).  
 
Similarly we can define strongly pseudo associator SPA(L) of the loop L. Now we 
proceed onto another type of loop called Jordan loop. 
 
DEFINITION [78]: Let L be a loop. We say L is a Jordan loop if ab = ba. a
2(ba) = 
(a
2b) a for all a, b ∈ L. 
 
Example 2.4.1: Let L = {e, g1, … , g7} given the following table:

This is easily verified to be a Jordan loop of order 8. 
 
DEFINITION [65]: A loop L is said to be strictly non-right alternative if (xy)y ≠ 
x(yy) for any distinct pair x, y in L with x ≠ e and y ≠ e. Similarly we define 
strictly non-left alternative loop. We say a loop is strictly non-alternative if L is 
simultaneously a strictly non-left alternative and strictly non-right alternative 
loop.  
 
The following examples give a strictly non-left alternative and a strictly non-right 
alternative loops each of order 6.

2.5 Representation and isotopes of loops 
 
This section is mainly devoted to give the definition of right regular representation of 
loops. We also recall the definition of isotopes and the concept of G-loops. As we 
assume the reader to have a good knowledge of not only algebra but a very strong 
foundation about loops we just recall the definition; as our motivation is the 
introduction and study of Smarandache loops. Here the right regular representation 
or in short representation of loops are given. For a detailed notion about these 
concepts the reader is requested to refer Albert and Burn [1, 8, 9, 10]. 
 
Result: [1]: A set π of permutations on a set L is the representation of a loop (L, •) 
if and only if  
 
a. I ∈ π 
b. π is transitive on L and 
c. for α, β ∈ π,  if αβ
-1 fixes one element of L, then α = β. 
 
Let (L, •) be a finite loop. For α ∈ L, define a right multiplication Rα as a 
permutation of the loop (L, •) as follows: 
 
Rα : x → x • α we will call the set {Rα / α ∈ L} the right regular representation of 
(L, •) or briefly the representation of L. 
 
Result: [8, 9, 10]: If π is a representation of a loop L, then L is a Bol loop if and 
only if α, β ∈ π implies αβα ∈ π.  
 
Result: [8, 9, 10]: If π is the representation of a Bol loop and if α ∈ π then α
n ∈ π 
for n ∈ Z. 
 
Result: [8, 9, 10]: If π is the representation of a finite Bol loop for α ∈ π, α is a 
product of disjoint cycles of equal length.

(eg6) (g1g7g3) (g2g4g5) 
(eg7) (g1g4g2) (g3g5g6) 
 
where I is the identity permutation on the loop L. 
 
Now we go on to give the definition of isotopes for more information please refer 
Bruck [6]. 
 
DEFINITION 2.5.1: Let (L, •) be a loop. The principal isotope (L, ∗) of (L, •) 
with respect to any predetermined a, b ∈ L is defined by x ∗ y = XY, for all x, y ∈ 
L, where Xa = x and bY = y for some X, Y ∈ L.  
 
DEFINITION 2.5.2: Let L be a loop, L is said to be a G-loop if it is isomorphic to 
all of its principal isotopes. 
 
PROBLEMS: 
 
1. Does there exist a loop L of order 7 which is a G-loop? 
2. Can we have loops L of odd order n, n finite such that L is a G-loop? 
3. Give an example of a loop L of order 19 which in not a G-loop. 
4. Which class of loops are G-loops? Moufang? Bruck? Bol? 
5. Is an alternative loop of order 10 a G-loop?

2.6 On a new class of loops and its properties. 
  
 
The main objective of this section is the introduction of a new class of loops with a 
natural simple operation. As to introduce loops several functions or maps are defined 
satisfying some desired conditions we felt that it would be nice if we can get a natural 
class of loops built using integers.  
 
Here we define the new class of loops of any even order, they are distinctly different 
from the loops constructed by other researchers. Here we enumerate several of the 
properties enjoyed by these loops.  
 
DEFINITION [65]: Let Ln(m) = {e, 1, 2, …, n} be a set where n > 3, n is odd 
and m is a positive integer such that (m, n) = 1 and (m –1, n) = 1 with m < n.  
 
Define on Ln(m) a binary operation '•'  as follows:  
 
1. e • i = i • e = i for all i ∈ Ln(m) 
2. i
2 = i • i = e for all i ∈ Ln(m) 
3. i • j = t where t = (mj – (m-1)i) (mod n) 
 
for all i, j ∈ Ln(m); i ≠  j, i ≠ e and j ≠ e, then Ln(m) is a loop under the binary 
operation '•'. 
 
Example 2.6.1: Consider the loop L5(2) = {e, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. The composition table 
for L5(2) is given below: 
 
•

This loop is of order 6 which is both non-associative and non-commutative. 
 
Physical interpretation of the operation in the loop Ln(m):  
 
We give a physical interpretation of this class of loops as follows: Let Ln(m)= {e, 1, 2, 
… , n} be a loop in this identity element of the loop are equidistantly placed on a 
circle with e as its centre.  
 
We assume the elements to move always in the clockwise direction. 

 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Let i, j ∈ Ln(m) (i ≠ j, i ≠ e, j ≠ e). If j is the r
th element from i counting in the 
clockwise direction the i • j will be the t
th element from j in the clockwise direction 
where t = (m –1)r. We see that in general i • j need not be equal to j • i. When i = j 
we define i
2 = e and i • e = e • i = i for all i ∈ Ln(m) and e acts as the identity in 
Ln(m).  
 
Example 2.6.2: Now the loop L7(4) is given by the following table:

Let 2, 4 ∈ L7(4). Now 4 is the 2
nd element from 2 in the clockwise direction. So 2.4 
will be (4 –1)2 that is the 6
th element from 4 in the clockwise direction which is 3.  
 
Hence 2.4 = 3.

THEOREM [56]: Ln contains one and only one commutative loop. This happens 
when m = (n + 1) / 2. Clearly for this m, we have (m, n) = 1 and (m – 1, n) = 1.  
 
It can be easily verified by using simple number theoretic techniques.

The proof is left for the reader as an exercise. 
 
Note: If n = p where p is a prime greater than or equal to 5 then in Ln a loop is either 
commutative or strictly non-commutative. Further it is interesting to note if n = 3t 
then the class Ln does not contain any strictly non-commutative loop. 
 
THEOREM [65]: The class of loops Ln contains exactly one left alternative loop 
and one right alternative loop but does not contain any alternative loop. 
 
Proof: We see Ln(2) is the only right alternative loop that is when m = 2 (Left for the 
reader to prove using simple number theoretic techniques). When m = n –1 that is 
Ln(n –1) is the only left alternative loop in the class of loops Ln. 
 
From this it is impossible to find a loop in Ln, which is simultaneously right alternative 
and left alternative. Further it is clear from earlier result both the right alternative 
loop and the left alternative loop is not commutative.  
 
THEOREM [56]: Let Ln be the class of loops: 
 
1. Ln does not contain any Moufang loop 
2. Ln does not contain any Bol loop 
3. Ln does not contain any Bruck loop.  
 
The reader is requested to prove these results using number theoretic techniques. 
 
THEOREM [65]: Let Ln(m) ∈ Ln. Then Ln(m) is a weak inverse property (WIP) 
loop if and only if (m
2 – m + 1) ≡ 0(mod n). 
 
Proof: It is easily checked that for a loop to be a WIP loop we have "if (xy)z = e then 
x(yz) = e where x, y, z ∈ L." Both way conditions can be derived using the defining 
operation on the loop Ln(m).

It is easily verified L7(3) is a WIP loop. One way is easy for (m
2 – m + 1) ≡ 0 (mod 7) 
that is 9 – 3 + 1 = 9 + 4 + 1 ≡ 0(mod 7). It is interesting to note that no loop in the 
class Ln contain any associative loop.

The proof is left for the reader to verify. 
 
Now we proceed on to study the associator and the commutator of the loops in Ln.  
 
THEOREM [56]: Let Ln(m) ∈ Ln. The associator A(Ln(m)) = Ln(m). 
 
Hint: Recall.  
 
A(Ln(m)) = 〈{ t ∈ Ln(m) / t = (x, y, z) for some x, y, z ∈ Ln(m)}〉. Construct t using 
the definition of Ln(m) it is easily verified A(Ln(m)) = Ln(m).  
 
Similarly if we take Ln(m) any non-commutative loop in Ln(m), we see L'n(m) = Ln(m) 
where L'n(m) = 〈{ t ∈ Ln(m) / t = (x, y) for some x, y ∈ Ln(m)}〉. To prove Ln'(m) = 
Ln(m) it is sufficient to show that for every t ∈ Ln(m) there exists i, j ∈ Ln(m) such 
that (i, j) = t. Thus we see in case of the new class of loops Ln. A(Ln(m)) = L'n(m) = 
Ln(m) for meaningful Ln(m). One of the very interesting properties about this new 
class of loops is their subloops. We see these subloops enjoy some special properties.  
 
Let Ln(m) ∈ Ln, for every t / n there are t subloops of order k + 1 where k = n/t. Let 
Ln(m) = {e, 1, 2, … , n}, for i ≤ t consider the subset. Hi(t) = {e, i, i + t, i + 2t, … , 
i + (k – 1) t} of Ln(m). Clearly e ∈ Hi; it is left for the reader to prove Hi(t) is a 
subloop of Ln(m) of order k + 1. As i can vary from 1 to t, there exists t such 

 
36 
subloops. Let Hi(t) be subloops for i ≠ j we have Hi(t) ∩ Hj(t) = {e}. Also we have 
Ln(m) = 
)t(
Hi
t
1
i=∪
 for every t dividing n. Finally subloops Hi(t) and Hj (t) are 
isomorphic for every t dividing n.  
 
Suppose H is any subloop of Ln(m) of order t + 1 then t / n in view of this we have 
Ln(m) ∈ Ln contains a subloop of order k + 1 if and only if k/n. Now we want to find 
out for what values of n; the Lagrange's theorem for groups is satisfied by every 
subloop of Ln(m).  
 
Let Ln(m) ∈ Ln. The Lagrange's theorem for groups is satisfied by every subloop of 
Ln(m) if and only if n is an odd prime. This is easily verified when n is a prime we 
have |Ln(m)| = p + 1 as the order of the subloop is p + 1 as no t/p so only 1/p so 
there exists a subloop of order 2 and as p / p hence there exists a subloop of order p 
+1. Thus trivially the Lagrange's theorem for groups is satisfied only by loops Ln(m) 
of order p + 1 where p is a prime ( n = p ). Further we have for any loop Ln(m) of Ln 
there exist only 2-sylow subloops. Clearly |Ln(m)| = n + 1 where n is odd (n > 3). As 
2/n + 1 so Ln(m) has 2-sylow subloops. Also if Ln(m) ∈ Ln; n is an odd prime say n = 
p then we see that there exist no element of order p in Ln(m). In view of this property 
we state as "If Ln(m) ∈ Ln, n an odd prime then no element in Ln(m) satisfies Cauchy 
Theorem for groups. It is left for the reader to show that no loop in the class of loops 
Ln has a normal subloop; this leads us to frame a nice property that all loops in the 
class Ln are simple.  
 
Example  2.6.5: The subloops of the loop L5(2) are {e}, {e, 1}, {e, 2}, {e, 3}, {e, 
4}, {e, 5} and L5(2). 
 
The lattice of subloops of L5(2) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Here it is important to note that all these proper subloops are subgroups. Thus the 
lattice of subloops (subgroups) forms a modular lattice. We see Ln(m) ∈ Ln are all S-
loops. Thus we define in case of S-loops the Smarandache subgroups, Smarandache 
subloops and Smarandache normal subloops. We call the related lattice of 
substructures as S-lattices. In view of this we prove the following theorem. 
 
THEOREM 2.6.1: Let Ln(m) ∈ Ln ( n a prime.) The subloops (or subgroups) of 
Ln(m) form a non-distributive modular lattice of order n + 2 where each element 
L5(2) 
{e,5} 
{e} 
{e, 1} 
{e,2} 
{e,4} 
{e,3} 

 
37 
is complement of the other and each chain connecting {e} and Ln(m) is of length 
3.  
 
Proof: We know the loops Ln(m) ∈ Ln (n-prime) have no subloops other than the 
subgroups. Ln(m), {e}, Ai = {e, i}, i = 1, 2, …, n. The following is the lattice of 
subloops:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The order of this loop is n + 2.  
  
Finally before we proceed to define about normalizers of the loops we see by the very 
definition of the loops Ln(m) in the class of loop Ln that all loops are power associative 
as every element in the loop Ln(m) is such that i • i = e for all i ∈ Ln(m) that is every 
element generates a cyclic group of order two; now it is left for the reader to prove 
that no loop in this class Ln is diassociative. 
 
We in case of loops Ln(m) ∈ Ln define two normalizers: First normalizer and Second 
normalizer. 
 
DEFINITION [56]: Let Ln(m) ∈ Ln and Hi(t) be a subloop of Ln(m). The first 
normalizer of Hi(t) is given by N1(Hi(t)) = {a ∈ Ln(m) / a(Hi(t)) = (Hi(t))a} the 
second normalizer N2 (Hi(t)) = {x ∈ Ln(m) / x (Hi(t))x = Hi(t)}. 
 
Example 2.6.6: Take L15(2) ∈ L15. Consider the subloop H1(3) = {e, 1, 4, 7, 10, 
13}, it is easily verified N1(H1(3)) = L15(2).  
 
It is important question to analyse, whether the two normalizers are equal or in 
general distinct. The answer is the two normalizers in general are different for a 
subloop in Ln(m). 
 
We prove this by an example. 
 
Example 2.6.7: Let L45(8) ∈ L45 be  a loop of order 46. Consider H1(15) be a 
subloop of L45(8). N1(H1(15)) can be found to equal to L45(8) that is the whole loop. 
But N2(Hi(15) = H1(5). So the two normalizers are not always equal.  
 
Now the natural concept would be the class equation for groups. The class equation 
for groups is not satisfied by any loop in Ln(m) except only by the commutative loop

Ln(m) ∈ Ln. Now we discuss about the isotopes of the loops Ln(m). Let (L, •) be a 
loop. The principal isotope (L1, ∗) of (L, •) with respect to any predetermined a, b ∈ 
L is defined by x ∗ y = XY, for all x, y ∈ L, where Xa = x and bY = y for some X, Y ∈ 
L. We give the following examples of loops and their principal isotopes.  
 
Example 2.6.8: Let (L5(2), •) be the loop and its principal isotope is  (L5(2), ∗), is 
given below:

The main observation is that the principal isotopes do not in general preserve basic 
properties of the loops. This is illustrated by the following:  
 
The principal isotope of a commutative loop can also be strictly non-commutative.

2.7 The new class of loops and its application to proper edge colouring of 
the graph K2n 
 
In this section we study the right regular representation of the new class of loops 
introduced in section 2.6. We formulate the necessary condition for the existence of 
k-cycle in the representation of Ln(m) and using this we find out the cycle 
decomposition of Ln(m). Further, we prove that the number of different 
representations of loops of order 2n (n ≥ 3), which are right alternative and in which 
square of each element is identity, is equal to the different proper edge colouring of 
the graph K2n, using exactly (2n – 1) colours. As this application happens to be an 
important one we prove each and every other concepts needed first. 
 
THEOREM [65]: Let Ln(m) ∈ Ln. Then for any a ∈ Ln(m) (a ≠ e) the 
transposition (a, e) belongs to the permutation Ra. 
 
Proof: Since in Ln(m) we have a • a = e, Ra : e → e • a = a and Ra : a → a • a = e. 
Hence the transposition (a, e) belongs to the permutation Ra.  
 
THEOREM [65]: Let Ln(m) ∈ Ln and a ∈ Ln(m) (a ≠ e). If the permutation Ra 
contains a k-cycle then, ((m – 1)
k + (– 1)
k–1) (a – x) ≡ 0 (mod n) where x is any 
element in the k-cycle. 
 
Proof: Consider the permutation Ra(a ∈ Ln(m) and a ≠ e). Let the permutation Ra 
contain a k-cycle say (x1, x2, … , xk) (as we are taking the cycle decomposition of 
elements other than a and e, xi ≠ e and xi ≠ a, for i = 1, 2, … , k) 
 
Now x1 • a = x2 that is, x2 ≡ (ma – (m – 1)x1) (mod n)     
x2 • a = x3 so, x3 ≡ (ma – (m – 1)x2) (mod n) or 
x3 ≡ (ma – (m – 1)(ma – (m – 1) x1)) (mod n) or x3 ≡ (ma –(m–1)a + (m- 1)
2x1) 
(mod n).  
 
Finally xk • a = x1 so we get ma (1 – (m – 1) + (m – 1)
2 + … + (-1)
k-1 (m-1)
k-1) + 
(-1)
k (m – 1)
k x1 ≡ x1(mod n). Simplifying this we get ((m – 1)
k + (-1)
k –1 )(a – x1) ≡  
0 (mod n) Since any xi's for 1 ≤ i ≤ k can be taken as the first entry in the cycle (x1, 
x2, … , xk) we have ((m – 1)
k + (–1)
k–1) (a – x) ≡ 0 (mod n) for any x ∈ {x1, x2, …, 
xk}.  
 
Hence the result.  
 
The converse of the above theorem is not true in general. For consider the loop L7(4) 
given by the following table:

(e 6) (1 7 3) (2 4 5) 
(e 7) (1 4 2) (3 5 6) 
 
where I is the identity permutation of the loop L7(4). 
 
Here m = 4 so (4 – 1)
6 + (–1)
6–1 = 728 ≡ 0(mod 7) so (4 – 1)
6 + (–1)
6–1 (a – x) ≡ 
0(mod 7) for any a, x ∈ L7(4), but in the representation of L7(4), no permutation has 
a cycle of length 6.  
 
As an immediate consequence of this we have the following: 
 
COROLLARY [65]: Let Ln(m) ∈ Ln. If m, k (k < n) such that ((m–1)
k +(–1)
k–1, 
n) = 1, then any permutation Ra ∈ π (π the representation of Ln(m)) does not 
have a cycle of length k. 
 
Proof: Suppose the permutation Ra ∈ π has a cycle of length k, then  (( m – 1)
k  +     
(-1)
k–1) (a – x) ≡ 0(mod n) for any x in the k-cycle. But this cannot happen as ((m – 
1)
k + (–1)
k–1, n) = 1 and (|x – a|, n) < n. So the permutation Ra does not contain a 
k-cycle. 
 
COROLLARY [65]: Let Ln(m) ∈ Ln. If there exists k ∈ N (N-natural numbers, k < 
n), such that ((m – 1)
k + (–1)
k–1) ≡ 0(mod n) then there exists no cycle of length 
greater than k in any permutation α ∈ π where π is the representation of Ln(m). 

 
42 
 
Proof: ((m – 1)
k + (–1)
k–1) ≡ 0(mod n) implies ((m – 1)
k + (–1)
k–1) (a – x) ≡ 0 
mod n for any a, x ∈ Ln(m). So all the elements of Ln(m) will decompose into the 
cycles of length at most k, hence no cycle of length greater than k exists.  
 
THEOREM [65]: Let Ln(m) ∈ Ln. If n is an odd prime and k is the least positive 
integer such that (m – 1)
k ≡ (–1)
k (mod n), then any permutation Ra ∈ π (a ≠ e) 
in the representation of Ln(m) is a product of 2 cycles and t, k-cycles where t = 
(n – 1) / k. 
 
Proof: We know by earlier result and by the construction of Ln(m) there exists a 2 
cycle namely (a, e). Now we will show that the other p – 1 elements will decompose 
only as k-cycles. Since it is given that ((m – 1)
k + (–1)
k–1) ≡ 0(mod n) by the earlier 
corollaries there exists no cycle of length greater than k. Now it only remains to show 
that there exists no cycle of length less than k. If not, let there exist a cycle of length s 
(s ≤ k) in the permutation Ra (a ∈ Ln(m) and a ≠ e). Then we have by earlier 
theorem ((m – 1)
s + (–1)
s–1) (a – x) ≡ 0(mod n). Now as x ≠ a and n is a prime 
number we have (m –1)
s ≡ (–1)
s (mod n), which is a contradiction as k is the least 
such number. So no cycle of length less than k-exists. Thus the remaining (n – 1) 
elements will decompose into (n – 1) / k cycles of length k. 
 
Using the theorem and corollaries already proved we find out the decomposition of 
Ln(m) when n is a composite number.  
 
THEOREM [65]: Let Ln(m) ∈ Ln n a composite number. If ((m – 1)
k + (–1)
k–1, 
n) = dk (dk < n) and k is the least integer for this dk, then in any permutation Ra 
∈ π (a ≠ e  and π the representation of Ln(m)), there exists [(dk – 1) / k] cycles 
of length k, where [x] denotes the largest integer not exceeding x for any x ∈ R 
(R: the set of real numbers) and the remaining elements will decompose into 
cycles of length t where t is the least integer such that ((m – 1)
t + (–1)
t–1), n) = 
n.  
 
We will illustrate this result by an example.  
 
Example 2.7.2: Let L45(8) ∈ L45. We will find out the cycle decomposition in the 
representation of the loop L45(8). Here m = 8 and k = 2 is the least integer such that 
(((m – 1)
2 + (–1)
2–1), 45) = 3, so there exists [(3 – 1) / 2] = 1 cycle of length 2. 
k= 4 is the least integer such that (((m – 1)
4 + (–1)
4–1), 45) = 15, so that there exist  
[(15–1)/4] = 3 cycles of length 4.  
 
Further k = 6 is the least number such that (((m – 1)
6 + (–1)
6–1) , 45) = 9 hence 
there exists [(9 – 1) / 8] = cycles of length 6. Now k = 12 is the least number such 

 
43 
that (((m – 1)
12 + (–1)
12–1), 45) = 45. So the remaining 24 element will decompose 
into cycles of length 12, hence there exist 2 cycles of length 12. 
 
COROLLARY [65]: Let Ln(m) ∈ Ln. Then each permutation Ra ∈ π (a ≠ e and π 
is the representation of L(m)) belongs to the same cycle class. 
 
Proof: As in theorems and results we see the cycle decomposition does not depend on 
the choice of a ∈ Ln(m), that is it is the same for all a, a ≠ e. So each permutation Ra 
∈ π belongs to the same cycle class. We know that if the cycle class of permutation is 
(k1, k2, … , kn), then its order is the l.c.m. of the non-zero ki's.  
 
Thus we have the following result: 
 
COROLLARY [65]: Order of each permutation Ra in π is the same for all a ∈ 
Ln(m) ( a ≠ e). 
 
LEMMA [65]: Let L be a right alternative loop of even order say 2s (s ≥ 3) in 
which the square of each element is the identity. Then its representation contains 
identity permutation on L and (2s – 1) other permutations which are products of 
disjoint transpositions. Further no two permutations have any transpositions in 
common. 
 
Proof: Let L be a right alternative loop of even order in which square of each element 
is identity and π be its representation. Clearly I ∈ π (I is the identity permutation on 
L). Take a ∈ L ( a ≠ e). Let Ra: x → y ⇒ xa = y. Now ya = (xa) a = x(aa) (as L is 
right alternative) = x (as the square of each element is identity) so if Ra: x → y then 
Ra : y → x that is Ra is the product of disjoint transpositions. If the transposition (x, y) 
belongs to both Ra and Rb for some a, b ∈ L, then we have Ra: x → y and Rb: x → y 
that is xa = y and xb = y so xa = ab which gives a = b.  
 
Thus no two different permutations have any transposition in common. 
 
LEMMA [65]: Let L = {1, 2, … , n + 1} n odd and Sn +1  be the set of all 
permutations on the set L. If π ∈ Sn+1 is such that  
 
i. 
π contains the identity permutation on L. 
ii. 
π contains n non-identity permutations satisfying the 
following two conditions 
 
a. Each permutation is the product of disjoint transpositions 
b. No two permutations have any transposition in common. 
Then π is a representation of a right alternative loop of 
order n + 1 in which square of each element is identity. 

 
44 
 
Proof: Let π ∈ Sn+1 be a set of permutations on L satisfying the above conditions. First 
we will show that π is a representation of some loop on the set L. To prove the 3 
results of Albert [1]. 
 
a. Clearly π has identity. 
 
b. To show that π is transitive on L. Now these n non-identity distinct 
permutations have (n(n+1))/2 different transpositions. But this is the 
number of possible transpositions over the set of (n+1) elements. So 
for any a, b ∈ L, there exists a α ∈ π such that (a, b) ∈ α, α: a → b. 
Hence π is transitive on L.   
 
c. We will show that αβ
-1 (α ≠ β) where α, β ∈ π, does not fix any 
element of L. For if x ∈ L then the transposition (x, y) ∈ β for some y 
∈ L. For this y ∈ L, the transposition (y, z) ∈ α for some z ∈ L. 
Hence z ≠ x otherwise both α and β will have (x, y) which is not 
possible as α ≠ β. Hence π is a representation for some loop on the 
set L. Now we will show that  
 
i. 
x
2 = e (where e is the identity of the loop L) for all x ∈ L 
and 
ii. 
L is a right alternative loop. 
 
To prove x
2 = e (x ≠ e). Let x ∈ L, consider Rx ∈ π if Rx: x → a then Rx: a → x for 
some a ∈ L, that is if x • x = a and a • x = x. Thus (x • x) x = x implies x • x = e or 
x
2 = e. To prove L is right alternative let x, y ∈ L consider Ry ∈ π if Ry : x → a then Ry: 
a → x that is x • y = a and a • y = a. Therefore (xy) y = x as (a = xy) or (xy)y = x • 
e = x(yy). Hence L is right alternative. Hence π represents a loop on L, which is right 
alternative and in which square of every element is identity. 
 
THEOREM [65]: Let π ∈ Sn+1, satisfy the conditions (i) and (ii) of the above 
lemma. If f(n) is the number of distinct possible choices of π, then any right 
alternative loop of order n + 1(n-odd)in which square of each element is identity 
has the representation out of these f(n) representations. 
 
Proof: Clearly from the above results, the theorem is true.  
 
The major application to edge colouring of the graph K2n is given below. 
 
THEOREM [65]: The number of different representations of loops of order 2n 
(n > 3) which are right alternative and in which square of each element is 

 
45 
identity, is equal to different proper edge colourings of the graph k2n using exactly 
2n – 1 colours. 
 
Proof: Let L = {1, 2, … , 2n} be a set of 2n elements and π ⊂ S2n be the set of 
permutations on L as in the above theorem. Now construction of π can be put in other 
words as follows. Let the number of objects be 2n say 1, 2, … , 2n. From these 2n 
numbers we can form (2n) (2n –1)/2 (this is n(2n – 1)) distinct non-ordered pairs 
in (2n – 1) lines such that each line contains n pairs in which all elements from 1 to 
2n occurs. Obviously, no two lines will have any pair in common. Such partition of 
pairs together with identity will give π.  
 
Now let us look at this problem graph theoretically. Consider the graph K2n which has 
2n vertices and 2n(2n –1)/2 edges that is n(2n – 1) edges. So we can treat each non-
ordered pair as an edge. Now if we give different (2n – 1) colours to the pairs of 
different (2n – 1) lines, then no two edges which meet at a vertex will have the same 
colour, which is a proper edge colouring of the graph K2n using (2n – 1)colours. 
Hence the number of different representations of our loops and the number of 
different proper edge colourings of the graph K2n using (2n – 1) colours are the 
same.  
 
Example 2.7.3: There exists only six different representations of loops of order 6, 
which are right alternative and in which square of each element is identity

Chapter three 
SMARANDACHE LOOPS 
 
In this chapter we introduce the notion of Smarandache loops and illustrate them by 
examples. This chapter has ten sections. The first section defines Smarandache loop. 
In section 2 we introduce substructures in loops like S-subloops, S-subgroups etc. 
Section 3 is completely spent to introduce new classical Smarandache loops. We 
introduce commutator subloops and Smarandache commutative loops in section 4. 
Section 5 is used to define Smarandache associativity and Smarandache associator 
subloops. Since study of loops, which satisfy identity, is a major study in loops in 
section 6 we introduce Smarandache identities in loops. The next section studies the 
special structure like S-left nuclei, S-middle nuclei, S-Moufang centre etc.  
 
The concept of Smarandache mixed direct product is introduced in section 8 which 
enables us to define Smarandache loop level II using this only we are in a position to 
extend the classical theorems, Smarandache Lagrange's criteria and Smarandache 
Sylow criteria. Further in section 9 we introduce Smarandache cosets in loops. The 
last section is used to define the Smarandache analogue of the very recently 
introduced loops by Michael K. Kinyon [40] in 2002, Smarandache ARIF loops, 
Smarandache RIF loops, Smarandache Steiner loops. Only these concepts has helped 
us to get odd order Moufang loops which are S-loops.  
 
Each section of this chapter gives a brief introduction of what is carried out in that 
particular section.   
 
 
3.1 Definition of Smarandache Loops with examples 
 
 
This section is devoted to the introduction of Smarandache loops and illustrate 
them with examples. Smarandache loops were introduced very recently (2002) [81]. 
Here we also give which of the well-known classes of loops are Smarandache loops. 
We would call this Smarandache loop of level I but we don't add the adjective level I 
but just call it as Smarandache loops as Smarandache loops of level II will be 
distinguished by putting II beside the definition.  
 
DEFINITION 3.1.1: The Smarandache loop (S-loop) is defined to be a loop L 
such that a proper subset A of L is a subgroup (with respect to the same induced 
operation) that is φ ≠ A ⊂ L.  
 
Example 3.1.1: Let L be the loop given the following table:

This is a S-loop as Hi = {e, ai}; i = 1, 2, 3, …, 7 are subsets of L which are 
subgroups.  
 
We have the following classes of loops to be S-loops.  
 
THEOREM 3.1.1: The natural class of loops Ln(m) ∈ Ln (n odd, n > 3, (m, n) = 
1, (m – 1, n) = 1 for varying m) are S-loops.  
 
Proof: We see by the very construction of loops Ln(m) in Ln each i ∈ Ln(m) is such 
that i • i = e where e is the identity element of Ln(m). Thus all proper subsets of the 
form {e, i} ⊂ Ln(m) for varying i are groups. Thus the class of loops Ln are S-loops.  
 
It is very exciting to note that the class of loops Ln are not Moufang or Bol or Bruck. 
To be more precise that none of the loops in the class Ln are Moufang or Bol or 
Bruck. But every loop in the class Ln are S-loops.  
 
THEOREM 3.1.2: Every power associative loop is a S-loop.  
 
Proof: By the very definition of a power associative loop L, we see every element in L 
generates a subgroup in L. Hence the claim.  
 
THEOREM 3.1.3: Every diassociative loop is a S-loop.  
 
Proof: Since a loop L is diassociative if every pair of elements of L generate a 
subgroup in L. Thus every diassociative loop is a S-loop.  
 
THEOREM 3.1.4: Let L be a Moufang loop which is centrally nilpotent of class 2. 
Then L is a S-loop.  
 
Proof: We know if L is a Moufang loop which is centrally nilpotent of class 2, that is, a 
Moufang loop L such that the quotient of L by its centre Z(L) is an abelian group; and 
let Lp denote the set of all elements of L whose order is a power of p. Recall that the 
nuclearly derived subloop, or normal associator subloop of L, which we denote by L∗ 
is the smallest normal subloop of L such that L/L∗ is associative (i.e. a group). Recall 

 
49 
also that the torsion subloop (subloop of finite order elements) of L is isomorphic to 
the (restricted) direct product of the subloops Lp where p runs over all primes.  
 
(Theorem 6.2. of R. H. Bruck [6] and [7] some theorems on Moufang loops and 
Theorem 3.9 of Tim Hsu [63] or in the finite case, Corollary 1 of Glauberman and 
Wright [22]). Using the main theorem A of Tim Hsu [63] we see that for p > 3, Lp is a 
group. So L is S-loop when L is a Moufang loop which is centrally nilpotent of class 2.  
 
In view of the Theorem 2.11 of Tim Hsu [63] we have the following:  
 
THEOREM 3.1.5: Let L be a Moufang loop. Then L is a S-loop.   
 
Proof: Now according to the theorem 2.11 of Tim Hsu [63] we see if L is a Moufang 
loop then L is diassociative that is for (x,y) ∈ L, 〈x, y〉 is associative. By theorem 
3.1.3. of ours a Moufang loop is a S-loop.  
 
Now we know Bol loops are power-associative (H.O. Pflugfelder [49, 50] and D. A. 
Robinson [55]) leading to the following theorem.  
 
THEOREM 3.1.6: Every Bol loop is a S-loop.  
 
Proof: Bol loops are power-associative from the above references and by our theorem 
3.1.2. All Bol loops are S-loops. 
 
Now Michael Kinyon [42] (2000) has proved every diassociative A-loop is a Moufang 
loop in view of this we have.  
 
THEOREM 3.1.7: Let L be a A-loop. If L is diassociative or L is a Moufang loop 
then L is a S-loop.  
 
Proof: In view of Corollary 1 of Kinyon [42] we see for an A-loop L. The two concepts; 
L is diassociative is equivalent to L is a Moufang loop so we have L to be S-loop.  
 
In view of this we propose an open problem in chapter 5.  
 
From the results of Kinyon [41] 2001 we see that every ARIF loop is a diassociative 
loop in this regard we have the following.  
 
THEOREM 3.1.8: Every ARIF loop is a S-loop.  
 
Proof: Kinyon [41] has proved in Theorem 1.5 that every ARIF loop is diassociative 
from our theorem 3.1.3 every diassociative loop is a S-loop. So all ARIF loops are S-
loops.  
 
Further using the Lemma 2.4 of Kinyon [41] we have another interesting result.  

 
50 
 
THEOREM 3.1.9: Every RIF-loop is a S-loop.  
 
Proof: According to Kinyon's [41] Lemma 2.4. every RIF loop is an ARIF loop. But by 
our Theorem 3.1.8 every ARIF loop is a S-loop. Hence every RIF loop is a S-loop.  
 
Fenyves [20](1969) has introduced the concept of C-loops.  
 
By Corollary 2.6 of Kinyon [41], every flexible C-loop is a ARIF-loop, we have a 
theorem.  
 
THEOREM 3.1.10: Every flexible C-loop is a S-loop.  
 
Proof: We see every flexible C-loop is a ARIF loop by Corollary 2.6. of Kinyon [41], 
Hence by Theorem 3.1.8 every flexible C-loop is a S-loop.  
 
This theorem immediately does not imply that all non-flexible C-loops are not S-loops; 
for we have the example 4.2 given in Kinyon [41] is a C-loop which is not flexible 
given by the following table:

Thus we have a non-flexible C-loop which is a S-loop leading to the following open 
problem proposed in Chapter 5. For more about C-loops please refer (F. Fenyves) 
[20].  

 
51 
 
Thus we have seen the definition of S-loops and the classes of loops which are S-
loops. Now we proceed on to define substructures in S-loops.  
 
PROBLEMS:  
 
1. Give an example of a loop of order 8 which is not a S-loop.  
2. Can a Bruck loop be a S-loop?  
3. Find a S-loop of order 9 which is not a Moufang loop.  
4. What is the order of the smallest S-loop? 
5. Does there exist a S-loop of order p, p a prime? 
 
 
3.2 Smarandache substructures in Loops 
 
In this section we introduce the concept of Smarandache subloops (S-subloops) and 
Smarandache normal subloops (S-normal subloops). The absence of S-normal 
subloops in a loop L leads us to the definition of Smarandache simple loops (S-simple 
loops). We prove that the class of loops Ln is a S-simple loop of order n + 1. We 
obtain some results about these definitions.  
 
DEFINITION 3.2.1: Let L be a loop. A proper subset A of L is said to be a 
Smarandache subloop (S-subloop) of L if A is a subloop of L and A is itself a S-
loop; that is A contains a proper subset B contained in A such that B is a group 
under the operations of L. We demand A to be a S-subloop which is not a 
subgroup.  
 
In view of this we have the following:  
 
THEOREM 3.2.1: Let L be a loop. If L has a S-subloop then L is a S-loop.  
 
Proof: If a loop L has S-subloop then we have a subset A ⊂ L such that A is a subloop 
and contains a proper subset B such that B is a group. Hence B ⊂ A ⊂ L so L is a S-
loop. So a subloop can have a S-subloop only when L is a S-loop.  
 
Example 3.2.1: Consider the loop L15(2) ∈ L15. H = {e, 1, 4, 7, 10, 13} is a subloop 
of the loop L15(2). Clearly H is a S-subloop of L. But it is interesting to note that in 
general all S-loops need not have every subloop to be a S-subloop or more 
particularly a S-loop need not have S-subloops at all.  
 
This following example will show it. 
 
Example 3.2.2: Let L5(2) be a loop given by the following table: 
 

 
52

It can be easily verified that this loop is a S-loop. This has in fact no subloops but only 
5 subgroups each of order two given by {e, 1}, {e, 2}, {e, 3}, {e, 4} and {e, 5}.  
 
In view of this we have the following definition: 
 
DEFINITION 3.2.2: Let L be a S-loop. If L has no subloops but only subgroups 
we call L a Smarandache subgroup (S-subgroup) loop. 
 
We have very many loops of even order given by the following.  
 
THEOREM 3.2.2: Let Ln(m) ∈ Ln where n is a prime. Then the class of loops Ln is 
a S-subgroup loop.  
 
Proof: Given n is a prime. So Ln(m) ∈ Ln has n + 1 elements and further no number t 
divides n. By the very construction of Ln(m) we see Ln(m) is a S-loop every element 
generates a cyclic group of order 2. Thus we have a class of loops Ln which are S-
subgroup loops for each prime n = p, n > 3.  
 
From this we see the existence of S-subgroup loops.  
 
Now we proceed onto define Smarandache normal subloops.  
 
DEFINITION 3.2.3: Let L be a loop. We say a non-empty subset A of L is a 
Smarandache normal subloop (S-normal subloop) of L if  
 
1. A is itself a normal subloop of L. 
2. A contains a proper subset B where B is a subgroup under the operations 
of L. If L has no S-normal subloop we say the loop L is Smarandache 
simple (S-simple).  
 
We have the following interesting results:  
 
THEOREM 3.2.3: Let L be a loop. If L has a S-normal subloop then L is a S-loop. 
 
Proof: Obvious by the very definition of S-normal subloop we see L is a S-loop.  
 

 
53 
Now we see that a loop may have normal subloops but yet that normal subloop may 
not be a S-normal subloop.  
 
In view of this we have the following: 
 
THEOREM 3.2.4: Let L be a loop. If L has a S-normal subloop then L has a 
normal subloop, so L is not simple.  
 
Proof: By the very definition of S-normal subloop in a loop L we are guaranteed, that 
the loop L must have a normal subloop so L is not simple. Hence the claim.  
 
We define analogous to the case of groups where the normal subgroups of a group 
form a modular lattice in the following:  
 
DEFINITION 3.2.4: Let L be a S-loop. The lattice of all S-subloops of L is denoted 
by S(L). We call this representation by Smarandache lattice representation of S-
subloops. Similarly we define Smarandache lattice representation of S-normal 
subloops and subgroups of a loop L.  
 
The study about these structures in S-loops unlike in groups or loops remain at a very 
dormant state. We prove the following theorems only in case of the new class of loops 
Ln which are analogous to results in groups. 
 
THEOREM 3.2.5: Let Ln(m) ∈ Ln be the class of S-loops. The Smarandache 
lattice representation of S-normal subloops of the loop Ln(m) form a two element 
chain lattice.  
 
Proof: Every Ln(m) ∈ Ln has no S-normal subloops. So the only trivial S-normal 
subloops are e and Ln(m) giving the two element chain 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This can be compared with the normal subgroups in the alternating group An, n ≥ 5. 
 
THEOREM 3.2.6: Let Ln(m) ∈ Ln, n an odd prime. S(L) the lattice of subgroups 
of every loop Ln(m) in Ln has a modular lattice with n + 2 elements for the 
Smarandache lattice representation of S-subgroups.  
 
Proof: Now Ln(m) when n is a prime has only n subgroups each of order two. Say Ai = 
{i, e} for i = 1, 2, …, n having the following lattice representation: 
Ln(m) 
〈e〉  

 
54 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We are not able to state whether in every loop L the normal subloop of L is a S-normal 
subloop of L. This problem we leave it as a problem to be solved in chapter 5. We 
have a class of loops which are S-simple.  
 
THEOREM 3.2.7: Let Ln(m) ∈ Ln, n a composite number. The S-subloops of 
Ln(m) has a modular lattice representation with t-subloops where n/t = p, p and t 
are primes, so p-subloops as n/p = t (p > 3 and t > 3).  
 
Proof: We know Ln(m) ∈ Ln where n = pt where both p and t are primes. We have p 
+ t  S-subloops which form a S-modular lattice.  
 
We have A1, A2, …, Ap and B1, B2, …, Bt as S-subloops having the following lattice 
representation:

For n not a product of two primes the question of representation of S-subloops 
remains an open problem in case of loops in Ln.  
 
 
Example 3.2.3: Let L15(8) be a loop in L15. The subgroups of L15(8) are B1 = {e, 1, 
6, 11}, B2 = {e, 2, 7, 12}, B3 = {e, 3, 8, 13}, B4 = {e, 4, 9, 14}, B5 = {e, 5, 10, 15} 
which are of order 4 and Ai = {e, i} for i = 1, 2, …, 15 each of order 2. Thus we have 
22 subgroups which has the following S-lattice representation.   
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This lattice is both non-modular and non-distributive. This set (L15(8), A1' = {e, 11, 4, 
7, 10, 13}, A2' = {e, 2, 5, 8, 11, 14}, A3' = {e, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15}, {e}) forms the 
diamond lattice which is modular.  
 
THEOREM 3.2.8: Let Ln(m) ∈ Ln. Then Ln(m) are S-simple.  
 
Proof: Each Ln(m) ∈ Ln is simple, so each Ln(m) has no non-trivial normal subloops 
so each Ln(m) ∈ Ln are S-simple. Thus we have a class of loops which are S-simple.

3.3 Some new classical S-loops 
 
In this section we define some new classical S-loops. When we say new they are loops 
not contemplated till date, the term classical means that these loops are built or 
makes use of classical properties in groups like Cauchy, Sylow or Lagranges so we 
choose to call this section 'Some new classical S-loops'. We define and give examples 
of them.  
 
DEFINITION 3.3.1: Let L be a finite S-loop. An element a ∈ A, A ⊂ L; A the 
subgroup of L is said to be Smarandache Cauchy element (S-Cauchy element) of 
L if a
r = 1 ( r > 1), 1 the identity element of L and r divides order of L; otherwise a 
is not a Smarandache Cauchy element of L.  
 
DEFINITION 3.3.2: Let L be a finite S-loop. If every element in every subgroup 
is a S-Cauchy element then we say S is a Smarandache Cauchy loop (S-Cauchy 
loop).  
 
Example 3.3.1: Consider the loop L11(3). Clearly L11(3) is a S-Cauchy loop as every 
subgroup of L11(3) is a cyclic group of order two and 2/|L11(3)| as the order of L11(3) 
is 12.  
 
In view of this we have a nice theorem.  
 
THEOREM 3.3.1: Every loop in the class of loops Ln are S-Cauchy loops.  
 

 
57 
Proof: Every loop in the class of loops Ln is of even order. Further by the very 
construction of the loops in Ln(m) ∈ Ln, every element in Ln(m) is of order two. Since 
all loops in Ln are S-loops and 2/|Ln(m)| we see every loop in Ln are S-Cauchy loops.  
 
DEFINITION 3.3.3: Let L be a finite loop. If the order of every subgroup in L 
divides the order of L we say L is a Smarandache Lagrange loop (S-Lagrange 
loop).  
 
DEFINITION 3.3.4: Let L be a finite loop. If there exists at least one subgroup in 
L whose order divides order of L then L is a Smarandache weakly Lagrange (S-
weakly Lagrange) loop.  
 
THEOREM 3.3.2: Every S-Lagrange loop is a S-weakly Lagrange loop.  
 
Proof: By the very definition of S-Lagrange loop and S-weakly Lagrange loop the result 
follows.  
 
In view of this we get a class of S-Lagrange loops of even order p + 1 where p is a 
prime greater than three.  
 
THEOREM 3.3.3: Let Lp be the class of loops, for any prime p. Then every loop in 
the class of loops Lp are S-Lagrange loop.  
 
Proof: We know Lp(m) ∈ Lp for every prime p is a loop of order p + 1.  The only 
subgroups in Lp(m) are of order 2. Hence the claim.  
 
THEOREM 3.3.4: Let Ln(m) ∈ Ln. Every loop in Ln is a S-weakly Lagrange loop.  
 
Proof: To show every Ln(m) in Ln is a S-weakly Lagrange loop we have to show Ln(m) 
has at least one subgroup whose order divides the order of Ln(m). Clearly for any i ∈ 
Ln(m) we have (e, i) is a subgroup of order 2 as all loops in Ln are of even order 
2/|Ln(m)|. Hence every Ln(m) ∈ Ln are S-weakly Lagrange loops.  
 
But do we have loops in the class Ln such that we have subloops H in Ln(m) where the 
o(H) does not divide the o(Ln(m)). To this end we have such examples.  
 
Example 3.3.2: Let L15(2) ∈ L15 be a loop of order 16. Clearly H = {e, 2, 5, 8, 11, 
14} is a subloop of L15(2) which is not a subgroup but this is a S-subloop of L15(2). 
o(H) = 6 and o(L15(2)) = 16. We see 6 / 16.  
 
But this loop is a S-Lagrange group as it contains only subgroups of order 2 and 4 and 
2 and 4 divide 16.  
 

 
58 
DEFINITION 3.3.5: Let L be a loop of finite order, if the order of every S-
subloop divides the order of L, we say L is a Smarandache pseudo Lagrange loop. 
(S-pseudo Lagrange loop).  
 
DEFINITION 3.3.6: Let L be a finite loop. If L has at least one S-subloop K such 
that o(K)/o(L) then we say the loop L is a Smarandache weakly pseudo Lagrange 
loop (S-weakly pseudo Lagranges loop).  
 
THEOREM 3.3.5: Every S-pseudo Lagrange loop is a S-weakly pseudo Lagrange 
loop.  
 
Proof: Obvious by the definitions 3.3.5 and 3.3.6. 
 
Now we proceed onto define Smarandache p-Sylow subloops.  
 
DEFINITION 3.3.7: Let L be a finite loop. Let p be a prime such that p/o(L). If L 
has a S-subloop of order p, then we say L is a Smarandache p-Sylow subloop (S-p-
Sylow subloop). It is important to note that p
r need not divide the order of L. 
 
DEFINITION 3.3.8: Let L be a finite loop. Let p be a prime such that p/o(L). If L 
has a S-subloop A of order m and B is a subgroup of order p, B ⊂ A, and p/m 
them we say L is a Smarandache p-Sylow subgroup (S-p-Sylow subgroup). 
 
We note here that m need not divide the order of L. Still L can be a S-p-Sylow 
subgroup. Suppose L is a loop such that L is S-subgroup loop then how to define 
Sylow structure in L.  
 
DEFINITION 3.3.9: Let L be a S-subgroup loop of finite order if every subgroup 
is either of a prime order or a prime power order and divides o(L) then we call L 
a Smarandache strong p-Sylow loop (S-strong p-Sylow loop).  
 
It is a notable fact that all subgroups in a finite S-strong p-Sylow loop should have 
order pα where p is a prime and α is a positive integer α ≥ 1.  
 
Such things occur and we define such class of loops also.    
 
THEOREM 3.3.6: Let Ln(m) ∈ Ln where n is a prime number. Then every loop in 
Ln is Smarandache strong 2-sylow loop.  
 
Proof: Given Ln(m) ∈ Ln and n is a prime number. But order of each Ln(m) in Ln is (n 
+ 1), so 2/n + 1. Every element in Ln(m) is of order two. Hence each Ln(m) ∈ Ln is a 
Smarandache strong 2-sylow loop. 
 

 
59 
The only classical theorem, which is left behind, is the Cayley's theorem. Can we have 
any nice analogue of Cayley's theorem? The answer is yes; but for this we have to 
introduce the concept of Smarandache loop homomorphism between loops.  
 
DEFINITION 3.3.10: Let L and L' be two Smarandache loops with A and A' its 
subgroups respectively. A map φ from L to L' is called Smarandache loop 
homomorphism (S-loop homomorphism) if φ restricted to A is mapped onto a 
subgroup A' of L'; that is φ : A → A' is a group homomorphism. The concept of 
Smarandache loop isomorphism and automorphism are defined in a similar way. 
It is important to observe the following facts:  
 
1. The map φ from L to L' need not be even be a loop homomorphism.  
2. Two loops of different order can be isomorphic.  
3. Further two loops which are isomorphic for a map φ may not be 
isomorphic for some other map η. 
4. If L and L' have at least subgroups A and A' in L and L' respectively which 
are isomorphic then certainly L and L' are isomorphic.  
 
Example 3.3.3: Let the two loops L5(3) and L7(3) be given by the following tables: 
 
 
•

Now the table for the loop L7(3) is given below:

This is S-loop of order 8 which is non-commutative, but both the loops are S-
isomorphic. For take A = {4, e} and A' = {7, e} we have a group isomorphism 
between the groups A and A' hence they are S-isomorphic as loops.  
 
In view of this we have the following nice result about the new class of loops Ln for n 
> 3, n odd for varying n.  
 
THEOREM 3.3.7: All S-loops in Ln and for odd n, n > 3 and varying appropriate 
m, have isomorphic subgroups. So all loops in the class Ln are S-isomorphic loops.  
 
Proof: Follows from the fact that every loop Ln(m) ∈ Ln has a subgroup of order 2. 
Hence we have got a S-loop isomorphism between any two loops in Ln even for varying 
n as is evident by the example.  
 
Now a few problems are left open.  
 
Can we have a class of S-loops which have Sn the symmetric group of degree n to be a 
subgroup for every appropriate n? If this is achieved certainly extension of Cayley's 
theorem for S-loops will be possible.  
 
To this end we will have the concept of Smarandache mixed direct product and some 
related results which will be dealt in this book. 
 
PROBLEMS:  
 
1. 
Does there exist a loop L which has Sn as its subgroup? 
2.

3.4. Smarandache commutative and commutator subloops 
 
In this section we introduce the concept of Smarandache commutative loop, 
Smarandache strongly commutative loop, Smarandache commutator loop etc. and 
study them. Further we introduce concepts like Smarandache cyclic loop, 
Smarandache pseudo commutative loops and characterize them. We illustrate each of 
these by examples. The main interesting concept about S-loops is that when the S-loop 
has no S-subloop then the commutator of the loop coincides with the S-commutator 
of the loop. If the S-loop has many S-subloops we can get more than one S-
commutator subloop. This is a unique property enjoyed only by S-loops and not by 
loops. This study has forced us to propose open research problems in chapter 5. 
 
DEFINITION 3.4.1: Let L be a loop. We say L is a Smarandache commutative 
loop (S-commutative loop) if L has a proper subset A such that A is a 
commutative group.  
 
Example 3.4.1: Consider the loop L7(3) given by the following table:

Clearly this loop is non-commutative but it is a S-commutative loop. Thus we see the 
following if a loop is commutative then it is clearly S-commutative leading to the nice 
result.  
 
THEOREM 3.4.1: Let L be a S-commutative loop then L need not in general be 
commutative.  
 
Proof: By an example. The loop given in example 3.4.1 is non-commutative but is S-
commutative.  
 
In view of this we give a definition of Smarandache strongly commutative loops.  
 
DEFINITION 3.4.2: Let L be a loop. L is said to be a Smarandache strongly 
commutative (S-strongly commutative) loop if every proper subset which is a 
group is a commutative group.  

 
62 
 
THEOREM 3.4.2: Let L be a S-strongly commutative loop then L is a S-
commutative loop.  
 
Proof: Obvious by the definitions 3.4.1 and 3.4.2. 
 
THEOREM 3.4.3: Every S-strongly commutative loop in general need not be a 
commutative loop.  
 
Proof: The proof is given by an example. Consider the loop L7(3) given in example 
3.4.1. Clearly L7(3) is non-commutative; but L7(3) is S-strongly commutative as every 
proper subset which is a group in L7(3) is a commutative group. Hence the claim.  
 
THEOREM 3.4.4: Let L be a power-associative loop. L is then a S-commutative 
loop. 
 
Proof: Given L is a power associative loop so any element generates a group so it must 
be a cyclic group, hence abelian. So a power associative loop is a S-commutative 
loop.  
  
THEOREM 3.4.5: Every loop in the class Ln where n is a prime; n > 3 is a S-
strongly commutative loop.  
 
Proof: We know every loop in the class Ln when n is a prime is of order n + 1. We 
have proved the only subloops of Ln(m) are subgroups of order 2 and it has no other 
subloops. Further every element generates a subgroup of order 2. Hence all loops 
Ln(m) in Ln, when n is a prime is a S-strongly commutative loop for every prime p, p > 
3.  
 
THEOREM 3.4.6: Let L be a loop, if Z(L) is a non-trivial centre then L is a S-
commutative loop.  
 
Proof: From the result of Pflugfelder [50] in his book on Quasigroups and loops: 
Introduction shows Z(L) is an abelian subgroup. Hence L is a S-commutative if Z(L) 
is non-trivial.  
 
DEFINITION 3.4.3: Let L be a loop. L is said to be a Smarandache cyclic loop (S-
cyclic loop) if L contains at least a proper subset A which is a cyclic group.  
 
DEFINITION 3.4.4: Let L be a loop. If every proper subset A of L which is a 
subgroup is a cyclic group then we say the loop L is a Smarandache strong cyclic 
loop (S-strong cyclic loop).  
 
THEOREM 3.4.7: Every S-strong cyclic loop is a S-cyclic loop.  
 

 
63 
Proof: Given L is a S-loop by the very definitions 3.4.3 and 3.4.4 we see every S-strong 
cyclic loop is a S-cyclic loop.  
 
It is pertinent to mention here that we cannot in case of loops define the concept of 
cyclic loop but we are gifted for in case of S-loops we can define S-strongly cyclic 
loops.  
 
We have in fact classes  of loops which are S-strongly cyclic.  
 
THEOREM 3.4.8: Every power associative loop which has no other non-cyclic 
subgroups in them are S-strong cyclic loops.  
 
Proof: We know if L is a loop which is power associative and if no subgroup which is 
non-cyclic then clearly L is a S-strongly cyclic loop. 
 
Here we give an example of a S-strongly cyclic group.  
 
Example 3.4.2: Let L5(4) be a loop given by the following table: 
 
• 
e

Clearly this is a S-strongly cyclic group which is also power associative.  
 
Now we proceed onto show Ln is a S-strongly cyclic loop when n is a prime.  
 
THEOREM 3.4.9: Let Ln(m) ∈ Ln, n > 3 and n a prime. Then every loop in Ln(m) 
is cyclic so Ln(m) is a S-strongly cyclic loop.  
 
Proof: Obvious from the fact every element in Ln(m) generates a cyclic group of order 
two and every distinct pair generates only a subloop or the whole loop.  
 
It is still interesting to note that even strictly non-commutative loop can be a S-
commutative loop and S-strongly commutative loop. Also these strictly non-
commutative loops can also be S-cyclic loops or S-strongly cyclic loops. We show 
these by examples.  
 
Example 3.4.3: Let L5(2) be the loop given by the following table:

This loop is non-commutative and non-associative. So L5(2) is a strictly non-
commutative loop but L5(2) is a S-strongly commutative loop and S-strongly cyclic 
loop.  
 
In view of this we have the following:  
 
THEOREM 3.4.10: Let Ln be a class of loops for any n > 3, if n =

α
(αi ≥ 1 for i = 1, 2, …, k) then it contains exactly Fn loops which 
are strictly non-commutative and they are: 
 
1. S-strongly commutative loops and  
2. S-strongly cyclic loops where Fn = ∏

Proof: It can be shown that every element generates a cyclic group of order two and  
any two distinct elements different from identity does not generate a subgroup but 
only a subloop or a S-subloop. Hence all these strictly non-commutative loops are S-
strongly cyclic and S-strongly commutative loops.  
 
It is left as an open research problem in Chapter 5 to find S-strongly commutative 
loops which are not S-strongly cyclic loops. 
 
DEFINITION 3.4.5: Let L be a loop. If A (A proper subset of L) is a S-subloop of L 
is such that A is a pseudo commutative loop then we say L is a Smarandache 
pseudo commutative loop (S-pseudo commutative loop) i.e. for every a, b ∈ A we 
have an x ∈ B such that a(xb) = b(xa) (or (bx)a), B is a subgroup in A. Thus we 
see for a loop to be a S-pseudo commutative we need not have the loop L to be a 
pseudo-commutative loop. If L is itself a pseudo commutative loop then trivially 
L is a S-pseudo commutative loop.  
 
DEFINITION 3.4.6: Let L be a loop. If a proper subset A ⊂ L where A is a S-
subloop is such that for every distinct pair a, b ∈ A we have a • x • b = b • x • a 
for all x ∈ A then we say the loop L is a S-strongly pseudo commutative loop.

The following can be easily derived which is left as an exercise to the reader.

a. S-pseudo commutative      
b. S-strongly pseudo commutative 
 
2. Prove a S-strongly pseudo commutative loop is a S-pseudo commutative loop.

This loop is non-commutative. It is left as an exercise for the reader to verify whether 
L is pseudo commutative. But in any case the loop has no S-subloops. So we are not in 
a position to define S-pseudo commutative in this case.  
 
Similarly we can have examples of loops which are commutative but which do not 
contain S-subloops. This is an example of a commutative loop which has no subloops, 
then how to define S-pseudo commutativity in these cases?  
 
Example 3.4.5: Let L19(10) be a loop which is a commutative loop of order 20. This 
loop has no S-subloops but L19(10) is a S-loop. Then for this loop we are not in a 
position to define S-pseudo commutativity.  
 
DEFINITION 3.4.7: Let L be a loop. The Smarandache commutator subloop (S-
commutator subloop) of L is denoted by L
s is the subloop generated by all the 
commutators in A, A a S-subloop of L. (A ⊂ L).  
 
L
s = 〈{x ∈ A / x = (y, z) for some y, z ∈ A}〉 with the usual notation and if L has no S-
subloops but L is a S-loop we replace A by L.  
 
Thus we have the notion of S-commutator subloop only when the loop L has a proper 
S-subloop or L is a S-loop. We see when L has no S-subloop and if L is a S-loop then 
we have the concept of S-commutator subloop to be one and the same for the loop L 
and for the S-loop.  
 
THEOREM 3.4.11: Let L be a S-loop which has no S-subloops then L' = L
s.  

 
66 
 
Proof: Obvious from the very definition of S-commutator in loop; we see if L has no S-
subloops but is a S-loop we have L' = L
s.  
 
THEOREM 3.4.12: Let Ln(m) ∈ Ln where Ln(m) is assumed to be a non-
commutative loop and n a prime. Then we have L'n(m) = Ln(m) = 
)
m
(
Ls
n
for all 
Ln(m) ∈ Ln.  
 
Proof: Clear from the fact that each Ln(m) when n is a prime is a S-loop which has no 
proper S-subloop or even subloops. In view of this we have L'n(m) = Ln(m) = 
)
m
(
Ls
n
 as in case of non-commutative loop we have L'n(m) = 〈{t ∈ Ln(m)/ t = (x, y) 
for some x, y ∈ Ln(m)}〉. Hence the claim.  
 
Example 3.4.6: Let L be a loop given by L21(11). Find subloops of order 3 and 12 
which are S-subloops that are S-commutator subloops. This is given as an exercise for 
the reader as it needs only simple number theoretic methods.  
 
In view of the definition of S-commutator subloops in a loop L, unlike in a loop we 
can have many S-commutator subloops if L is a loop which has more than one S-
subloop.  
 
THEOREM 3.4.13: Let L be a loop having more than one S-subloop. Then the S-
commutator subloops of L can have more than one subloop.  
 
Proof: If L has more than one S-subloop then we see if in particular the S-subloops 
are disjoint i.e. S1 ∩ S2 = {e} where S1 and S2 are two S-subloops of L then certainly L 
has more than one S-commutator subloop.

3.5. Smarandache associative and associator subloops 
 
 
In this section we introduce the notion of Smarandache associativity in loops, 
Smarandache pseudo associativity and Smarandache associator subloops. Here also 
like Smarandache commutator subloops we can for a given loop have many 
Smarandache associator subloops which is a distinctly an important property enjoyed 
only by Smarandache associators. Further these concepts leads us to several open 
unsolved problems which are enlisted in Chapter 5 of this book.  
 
Further it is exciting to note that the study when the Smarandache associator loop will 
be coincident with the associator loop and strongly pseudo associator loop. It is not 
even imaginable to obtain a relation even when L happens to a S-loop having no S-
subloops the relation between the sets A(L), PA(L), SPA(L), L
s, PA(L
s) and SPA(L
s).  
 
DEFINITION 3.5.1: Let L be a loop. We say L is a Smarandache associative loop 
(S-associative loop) if L has a S-subloop A such that A contains a triple x, y, z (all 
three elements distinct and different from e, the identity element of A) such that 
x • (y • z) = (x • y) • z. This triple is called the S-associative triple.  
 
DEFINITION 3.5.2: Let L be a loop. We say L is a Smarandache strongly 
associative loop (S-strongly associative loop) if in L every S-subloop has an S-
associative triple.  
 
THEOREM 3.5.1: Let L be a loop. If L is a S-strongly associative loop then L is a 
S-associative loop.  
 
Proof: Obvious from the very definitions 3.5.1 and 3.5.2. 
 
We have yet another nice theorem which guarantees or gives a condition on a loop L 
to be a S-associative loop.  
 
THEOREM 3.5.2: Let L be a loop. Let A be a S-subloop of L. If A contains a 
proper subset B which is a subgroup and |B| > 3 then clearly L is a S-associative 
loop.  
 
Proof: Follows from the fact if L is a loop such that it has A to be a S-subloop 
containing a subgroup B of order greater than or equal to 4 then we can take the 
triple in B\{e} and it will be an S-associative triple of L. Hence the claim.  
 
COROLLARY 3.5.1: If L is a S-associative loop, then L is a S-loop.  
 

 
68 
Proof: By the very definition of S-associative loop we see L must contain a S-subloop 
so that L becomes a S-loop.  
 
THEOREM 3.5.3: All S-loops are not S-associative loops but all S-associative 
loops are S-loops. 
 
Proof: By an example. Consider the S-loop L given by L = L13(2). Clearly L13(2) is a S-
loop but it has no S-subloop which has a S-associative triple. Hence the claim. But if L 
is an S-associative loop we know L has S-subloop so L is a S-loop.  
 
THEOREM 3.5.4: Let Ln(m) ∈ Ln be the class of loops where n is a prime. None 
of the loops in this class of loops Ln is a S-associative loop.  
 
Proof: Obvious from the very fact that each Ln(m) ∈ Ln is a S-loop but every loop 
Ln(m) has no S-subloop for Ln(m) has subgroups of order two and no subloops of any 
order other than Ln(m) itself. Hence the claim.  
 
DEFINITION 3.5.3: Let L be a loop if L has a S-subloop A such that for x, y ∈ A 
we have (xy)x = x(yx) then we say the loop L is a Smarandache pairwise 
associative loop (S-pairwise associative loop). 
 
DEFINITION 3.5.4: Let L be a loop if every S-subloop A of L is a S-pairwise 
associative loop we say L is a Smarandache strongly pairwise associative loop (S-
strongly pairwise associative loop).  
 
THEOREM 3.5.5: Every S-strongly pairwise associative loop is a S-pairwise 
associative loop.    
 
Proof: By the very definition of S-pairwise associative loop and S-strongly pairwise 
associative loop we have the theorem to be true.  
 
THEOREM 3.5.6: If L is a S-strongly pairwise associative loop or a S-pairwise 
associative loop, L is a S-loop. 
 
Proof: True by the very definition of the two concepts S-pairwise associative and S-
strongly pairwise associative.  
 
THEOREM 3.5.7: Every loop in class of loops Ln are S-strongly pairwise 
associative.  
 
Proof: All loops in the class Ln are S-loops. Further it can be easily verified using 
simple number theoretic techniques that for every x, y ∈ Ln(m) ∈ Ln we have (xy)x = 
x(yx). Hence the claim.  
 

 
69 
DEFINITION 3.5.5: Let L be a loop. The Smarandache associator subloop (S-
associator subloop) of L is denoted by L
A is the subloop generated by all the 
associators in A, where A is a S-subloop of L ( A ⊂ L) i.e. L
A = 〈{x ∈ A/ x = (a,b,c) 
for some a, b, c ∈ L}〉 with the usual notation 〈B〉 denotes the loop generated by 
the set B. If L has no S-subloop but L is a S-loop we replace A by L itself. Thus we 
have the notion of S-associator subloop only when the loop L has a S-subloop or L 
itself is a S-loop. We see when L has no S-subloops but L a S-loop then the concept 
of S-associator subloop and the associator subloop coincide.  
 
THEOREM 3.5.8: Let L be a S-loop which has no S-subloops then we have A(L) = 
L
A i.e. the associator subloop of L coincides with the S-associator subloop. 
 
Proof: Obvious by the very definition of S-associator subloop and the associator 
subloop of a S-loop.  
 
THEOREM 3.5.9: Let Ln(m) ∈ Ln where Ln(m) is a S-loop and has no S-subloops. 
Then A(Ln(m)) = 
)
m
(
LA
n
 = Ln(m).  
 
Proof: We know for all loops Ln(m) in the class of loops Ln we have A(Ln(m)) = 
Ln(m), using number theoretic techniques. So for the loop Ln(m) in Ln which are 
always S-loops we have, if Ln(m) has no S-subloops then A(Ln(m)) = 
)
m
(
LA
n
= Ln(m). 
Hence the claim. 
 
The natural question which arises is that what happens in case Ln(m) has S-subloops. 
Further we see if L is a loop having many S-subloops we will have several S-associator 
subloops associated with them? Will those S-associator subloops be distinct or 
identical even for different S-subloops? These problems are proposed as open 
problems in the chapter 5 of this book. 
 
Example 3.5.1: Let L = L45(8) be a loop of order 46 in L45. Now L45(8) is a S-loop. 
Further A(L45(8)) = L45(8). Now consider the S-subloop A = {e, 1, 16, 31}. A is a S-
subloop for H = {1,e} is a subgroup of A. We see in fact A itself is a subgroup, now 
the

8
(
LA
45
 = {1, 16, 31, e}. Clearly A(L45(8)) ≠ 
)
8
(
LA
45
. From this we have a nice 
consequence.  
 
THEOREM 3.5.10: Let L be a loop if L is a S-loop having a S-subloop A then in 
general A(L) ≠ L
A.  
 
Proof: By an example. Consider the loop L45(8) given in example 3.5.1. Clearly for the 
S-subloop, A = {e, 1, 16, 31} we see 
)
8
(
LA
45
= {e, 1, 16, 31} but A(L45(8)) ≠ L45(8). 
Hence the claim.  
 

 
70 
Now we proceed onto define Smarandache pseudo associativity in loops.  
 
DEFINITION 3.5.6: Let L be a loop. Suppose A is a S-subloop in L, if we have an 
associative triple a, b, c in A such that (ax)(bc) = (ab)(xc) for some x ∈ A. We 
say L is a Smarandache pseudo associative loop (S-pseudo associative loop) if 
every associative triple in A is a pseudo associative triple of A for some x in A. If L 
is a S-loop having no S-subloops then we replace A by L. 
 
DEFINITION 3.5.7: Let L be a loop and A be a subloop. If for any associative 
triple a, b, c ∈ A we have (ax)(bc) = (ab)(xc) for some x ∈ L then we say the 
triple is strongly pseudo associative. If in particular every associative triple in A 
is strongly pseudo associative then we say the loop L is Smarandache strongly 
pseudo associative loop (S-strongly pseudo associative loop).  
 
If in particular L is a S-loop which has no S-subloop we replace A by L in the 
definition.  
 
DEFINITION 3.5.8: Let L be a Smarandache pseudo associative loop. Then 
PA(L
s) = 〈{t ∈ A/ (ab)(tc) = (at)(bc) where (ab)c = a(bc) for a, b, c ∈ A}〉 
denotes the Smarandache pseudo associator subloop of L (S-pseudo associator 
subloop of L).  
 
DEFINITION 3.5.9: Let L be a loop. A be a S-subloop of L. The set SPA(L
S) = 〈{t 
∈ L / (ab)(tc)=(at)(bc) where (ab)c = a(bc) and a, b, c are in A}〉 denotes the 
Smarandache strongly pseudo associator (S-strongly pseudo associator) subloop 
of L. 
 
Clearly PA(L
s) ⊂ SPA(L
s) this is left for the reader to prove.

3.6. Smarandache identities in Loops 
 
This section is devoted to the introduction of concepts like Smarandache Bol loops, 
Smarandache Bruck loops etc. Also we define Smarandache strong power associative 
loop, Smarandache strong Bruck loop and so on. We study those properties and show 
in case of the class of loops in Ln when n is prime these loops cannot be S-Bruck or S-
Bol or S-Moufang but the class of loops are S-power associative.  
 
We obtain some results about these properties. In fact we have proposed several 
problems of finding conditions for them to be S-strong Bol loops, S-strong Moufang 
loops etc. We define a Smarandache Bol triple in a loop L. We extend this idea to the 
case of Smarandache strong Bol triple. Similarly one can define using Bruck identity 
and Moufang identity.  
 
DEFINITION 3.6.1: A Smarandache Bol loop (S-Bol loop) is defined to be a loop 
L such that a proper subset A of L which is a S-subloop is a Bol-loop (with respect 
to the induced operations). That is φ ≠ A ⊂ S.  
 
Similarly Smarandache Bruck loops (S-Bruck loop), Smarandache Moufang loops (S-
Moufang loop), Smarandache WIP loop (S-WIP loop) and Smarandache right (left) 
alternative loop (S-right (left) alternative loop) are defined. It is pertinent to mention 
that in the definition 3.6.1 we insist A should be a subloop of L and not a subgroup of 
L. For every subgroup is a subloop but a subloop in general is not a subgroup. 
Further every subgroup will certainly be a Moufang loop, Bol loop, Bruck loop and 
right (left) alternative loop, WIP loop etc. since in groups the operation is associative. 
Hence only we make the definition little rigid so that automatically we will not have all 
Smarandache loops to be Smarandache Bol loops, Smarandache Moufang loops etc.  
 
THEOREM 3.6.1: Every Bol loop is a Smarandache Bol loop but every 
Smarandache Bol loop is not a Bol loop. 
 
Proof: Clearly every Bol loop is a Smarandache Bol loop as every subloop of a Bol 
loop is a Bol loop. But a Smarandache Bol loop L is one which has a proper subset A 
which is a Bol loop. Hence L need not in general be a Bol loop.  
 

 
72 
THEOREM 3.6.2: No loop in the class of loops Ln(m), n an odd prime is a  
 
1. Smarandache Bol loop 
2. Smarandache Bruck loop 
3. Smarandache Moufang loop 
 
Proof: We know these loops Ln(m) ∈ Ln when n is an odd prime greater than 3 do not 
have any proper subloops and it has only subgroups of order 2. So for Ln(m) ∈ Ln the 
class of loops are not S-Bol loop, S-Moufang loop or S-Bruck loop. Hence the 
theorem. 
 
THEOREM 3.6.3: Every finite ARIF loop of odd order is a S-Moufang loop. 
 
Proof: By Corollary 2.14 to Theorem 2.13 of [41] 2001 we have every finite ARIF-
loop of odd order is Moufang; so every subloop of this loop will also be Moufang 
hence ARIF loop is a S-Moufang loop.  
 
THEOREM 3.6.4: The loop Ln(m) ∈ Ln is a S-WIP loop if and only if (m
2 – m + 
1) ≡ 0 (mod n) ( n a non-prime).  
 
Proof: We assume n is a non-prime for if we assume n is a prime. Ln(m) has no 
subloops only subgroups of order 2.  
 
Recall that Ln(m) is a WIP loop if (xy)z = e implies x(yz) = e where  
 
x, y, z ∈ Ln(m) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
           …1 
 
Now assume Ln(m) is a WIP loop. x, y, z such that (x – y, n) = 1 and z = xy. Now z = 
xy implies.  
 
z ≡ (my – (m – 1)x) (mod n) 
 
 
 
   
 
           …2 
 
Since Ln(m) is a WIP loop and (xy)z = e we must have x(yz) = e or yz = x.  
 
That is  
 
x ≡ (mz – (m – 1)y) (mod n)   
 
 
 
 
 
           …3 
  
Putting the value of z from (2) in (3) we get 
 
(m
2 – m + 1) (x – y) ≡ 0 (mod n) or (m
2 – m + 1) ≡ 0(mod n)  
           …4 
 
Conversely if (m
2 – m + 1) ≡ 0 (mod n) then it is easy to see that (3) holds good 
whenever (2) holds good, that is (xy)z = e implies x(yz) = e. x, y and z are distinct 

 
73 
elements of Ln(m)\{e}. However if one of x or y or z is equal to e or x = y then (1) 
holds trivially. Hence Ln(m) is a WIP loop. So all subloops will be WIP loops only if n 
is an odd non-prime greater than 3.  
 
DEFINITION 3.6.2: Let L be a loop we call a triple (x, y, z) where x, y, z ∈ L to 
be a Smarandache Bol triple (S-Bol triple) if the Bol identity ((xy)z)y = x((yz)y) 
is true. It is to be noted that x, y, z cannot be interchanged in anyway. 
 
Example 3.6.1: Let L15(8) be a loop. We can verify x = 2, y = 4 and z = 13 is a 
Smarandache Bol triple. Clearly if x = 13, y = 4 and z = 2 is taken we see the Bol 
identity is not true. Thus we define a concept called Smarandache strong Bol triple.  
 
DEFINITION 3.6.3: Let L be a loop. A triple (x,y,z) where x, y, z ∈ L is called the 
Smarandache strong Bol triple if the Bol identity is satisfied by all the 6 
permutations (x, y, z). 
 
We similarly define Smarandache Bruck triple, Smarandache strong Bruck triple, 
Smarandache Moufang triple and Smarandache strong Moufang triple and propose 
some problems. 
 
DEFINITION 3.6.4: Let L be a loop which is not a diassociative loop if L has a S-
subloop A which is diassociative then we say L is a Smarandache diassociative 
loop (S-diassociative loop).  
 
Note: If we assume the loop L to be diassociative then trivially L would be S-
diassociative that is why we assume L is not a diassociative loop. 
 
DEFINITION 3.6.5: Let L be a non-power associative loop. L is said to be a 
Smarandache power associative loop (S-power associative loop) if L contains a 
S-subloop which is a power associative subloop.  
 
Study of these types have  not been carried out in loop theory, i.e. even when the loop 
is not a diassociative loop, can it have subloops which are diassociative. So these two 
definitions not only motivates such study of those loops for which the S-subloops 
happen to hold to a nature or property not possessed by the loop.  
 
Now we proceed on to define Smarandache strong properties. 
 
DEFINITION 3.6.6: Let L be a loop if every proper S-subloop of L satisfies Bol 
identity. We say the loop L is a Smarandache strong Bol loop (S-strong Bol loop).  
 
On similar lines we define Smarandache strong Bruck loop, Smarandache strong 
Moufang loop, Smarandache strong WIP loops, Smarandache strong diassociative 
loop and Smarandache strong power-associative loop. 
 

 
74 
The following theorems are true for all Smarandache strong loops having special 
identities to be satisfied.  
 
THEOREM 3.6.5: If L is a S-strong Bol loop then it is a S-Bol loop.  
 
Proof: Obvious by the very definitions of S-strong Bol loop and S-Bol loops. Similarly 
we can prove theorems on S-strong Bruck loop, S-strong Moufang loops etc.

3.7 Some special structures in S-loops 
 
In this section we introduce the concepts of Smarandache left right and middle 
Nucleus for loops, which have S-subloop, or for S-loops. We also define Smarandache 
centre, Moufang centre first and second normalizer. We show in general 
Smarandache first and second normalizer are different and they coincide only in 
certain loops in Ln. 
 
Finally we prove in case of loop Ln(m) ∈ Ln when n is a prime the concept of 
Smarandache and the general definition coincide. We prove some results for these 
class of loops using number theoretic technique. The section ends with problems 
which are given as exercise for to reader to solve. 
 
DEFINITION 3.7.1: Let L be a loop the Smarandache left nucleus (S-left 
nucleus) S(Nλ) = {a ∈ A/ (a, x, y) = e for all x, y ∈ A} is a subloop of A, where A 
is a S-subloop of L. Thus we see in case of S-left nucleus we can have many 
subloops; it is not unique as in case of loops. If L has no S-subloops but L is a S-
loop then S(Nλ) = S Nλ  = Nλ. 

 
75 
 
DEFINITION 3.7.2: Let L be a loop, the Smarandache right nucleus (S-right 
nucleus) S(Nρ) = { a ∈ A/ (x, y, a) = e for all x, y ∈ A} is a subloop of L where A 
is a S-subloop of L. If L has no S-subloops but L is a S-loop then S(Nρ) = SNρ = Nρ. 
 
DEFINITION 3.7.3: Let L be a loop, the Smarandache middle nucleus (S-middle 
nucleus). S(Nµ) = { a ∈ A/ ( x, a, y) = e for all x, y ∈ A} is a subloop of L where A 
is a S-subloop of L. If L has no S-subloop but L is a S-loop then S(Nµ) = SNµ = Nµ. 
 
DEFINITION 3.7.4: The Smarandache nucleus S(N(L)) of a loop L is a subloop 
given by S(N(L)) = SNµ ∩ SNλ ∩ SNρ. It is important to note that unlike the 
nucleus we can have several Smarandache nucleus depending on the S-subloops. 
If L has no S-subloops but L is S-loop then S(N(L)) = N(L). 
 
DEFINITION 3.7.5: Let L be a loop. The Smarandache Moufang centre (S-
Moufang centre) SC(L) is the set of elements in a S-subloop A of L which 
commute with every element of A, that is SC(L) = {x ∈ A/ xy = yx for all y ∈ A}. 
If L has no S-subloops but L is a S-loop then we have SC(L) = C(L).If L has many 
S-subloops then we have correspondingly many S-Moufang centres SC(L). 
 
DEFINITION 3.7.6: Let L be a loop, the Smarandache centre (S-centre) (SZ(L)) 
of a loop. L is the intersection of SZ(L) = SC(L) ∩ S(N(L)) for a S-subloop A of L. 
 
DEFINITION 3.7.7: Let L be a loop if A is a S-subloop, then the Smarandache 
first normalizer (S-first normalizer) of A is given by SN1(A) = {a ∈ L/ a • A = A • 
a}. 
 
Example 3.7.1: Let L15(2) ∈ L15 be a loop. Clearly A = {e, 1, 4, 7, 10, 13} is a S-
subloop of L15(2). Clearly SN1(A) = L5(2). It is left for the reader to verify in this case 
N1(A) = SN1(A); but if A is not a S-subloop we do not define S-first normalizer. 
 
DEFINITION 3.7.8: Let L be a loop. A a S-subloop of L, the Smarandache second 
normalizer (S-second normalizer) of A is given by SN2(A) = {x ∈ L/ xAx
-1 = A}. 
The two Smarandache normalizer are not equal on any S-subloop in general. 
 
Example 3.7.2: Consider the loop L45(8) where H1(15) = {e, 1, 16, 31}, SN1 
(H1(15)) = L45(8) this is left for the reader to verify: SN2(H1(15)) = {e, 1, 6, 16, 21, 
26, 31, 36, 41} = H1(5). Thus SN1(H1(15)) ≠ SN2(H1(15)) in general.  
 
Now a natural question would be can we have S-subloops A in Ln(m) ∈ Ln for which 
SN1(A) = SN2(A). The answer to this question is yes. We to answer this problem 
introduce a notation for S-subloops in Ln(m). When we say Ln(m) has subloops we 
assume n is an odd non-prime for otherwise it will have no subloops. 

 
76 
 
Notation: Let Ln(m) be a loop, n an odd number which is not a prime for every t/n 
there exist subloops of order k + 1 where k = n/t. So if t/n we denote the subloop by 
Hi(t) ={e, i, i + t, … , i + (k – t)t}, it is a S-subloop of Ln(m) for every i ≤ t. 
 
Example 3.7.3: Now L9(8) ∈ L9 the number which divides 9 is 3. So we have the 
subloop 
 
H1(t) = {e, 1, 4, 7} 
H2(t) = {e, 2, 5, 8} 
H3(t) = {e, 3, 6, 9} 
 
 
The tables for them are as follows

Thus all subloops in L9(8) are abelian groups. So this is also a Smarandache 
Hamiltonian loop as every subloop is an abelian group of order 4. 
 

 
77 
Now we obtain a condition for the normalizers to be coincident in the loops Ln(m) ∈ 
Ln (n not a prime). 
 
THEOREM 3.7.1: Let Ln(m) ∈ Ln and Hi(t) be its S-subloop, then SN1(Hi(t)) = 
SN2(Hi(t)) if and only if (m
2 – m + 1, t) = (2m –1, t). 
   
Proof: Let Ln(m) ∈ Ln and Hi(t) be a S-subloop of Ln(m) first we show the first S-
normalizer SN1(Hi(t)) = Hi(k) where k = t/d and d = (2m – 1, t) we use only simple 
number theoretic arguments and the definition. SN1(Hi(t)) = {j ∈ Ln(m)/ jHi(t) = 
Hi(t)j} is the S-first normalizer of Hi(t). It is left for the reader to verify jHi(t) =  Hi(t)j 
if and only if (2m – 1) (i – j) ≡ 0(mod t) for j ∉ Hi(t). More over for j ∈ Hi(t) we 
have jHi(t) = Hi(t)j.  
 
So the possible values of j in Ln(m) for which jHi(t) = Hi(t)j are given by e, i, i + k, i 
+ 2k, … , i + ((n/k) – i) k. Thus SN1(Hi(t)) = Hi(k) using this fact we see k = t/d, d 
= (2m – 1, t). Now as we have worked for Smarandache first normalizer we can 
work for Smarandache second normalizer and show that SN2(Hi(t)) = Hi(k) here k = 
t/d and d = (m
2 – m + 1, t). This working is left as an exercise to the reader. Using 
these two facts we can say SN1(Hi(t)) = SN2(Hi(t)) if and only if (m
2– m+1, t) = ((2m 
– 1), t). Hence the claim.  
 
THEOREM 3.7.2: Let L be a S-loop which has no S-subloops. Then  
 
1. S(Nλ) = Nλ  
2. S(Nρ) = Nρ 
3. S(Nµ) = Nµ  
4. SN(L) = N(L) 
5. SC(L) = C(L) 
6. SZ(L) = Z(L) 
 
Proof: The proof is obvious by the definitions of all these concepts and their 
corresponding Smarandache definitions. 
 
THEOREM 3.7.3: Let Ln(m) ∈ Ln where n is a prime then SN(Ln(m)) = {e}. 
 
Proof: Now we know when n is a prime. Ln(m) ∈ Ln has no S-subloops but are S-
loops. So we have N(Ln(m)) = {e} as we know SN(Ln(m)) = N(Ln(m)). Hence we 
have SNρ (Ln(m)) = Nρ(Ln(m)), SNµ(Ln(m)) = Nµ(Ln(m)) SNλ(Ln(m)) = Nλ(Ln(m)). 
Now N(L) = Nµ ∩ Nλ ∩ Nρ.  
 
It is enough if we prove Nλ(Ln(m)) = {e} then it would imply N(Ln(m)) = {e}. So we 
shall prove Nλ(Ln(m)) = {e}. If x ≠ e ∈ Nλ(Ln(m)), choose elements y, z ∈ Ln(m) 
such that z ≠ x, xy ≠ z and yz ≠ x. Now x ∈ Nλ(Ln(m)) implies (x, y, z) = e which is 

 
78 
possible only when x = z. However e ∈ Nλ(Ln(m)) as (e, x, y) = e for all x, y, ∈ 
Ln(m). Hence the theorem.  
 
THEOREM 3.7.4: Let Ln(m) ∈ Ln, n a prime, then S-Moufang centre of Ln(m) is 
either {e} or Ln(m). 
 
Proof: Using the fact SC(Ln(m)) = C(Ln(m)) and e ∈ Ln(m) we see if e ≠ i ∈ 
C(Ln(m)) then i • j = j • i for all j ∈ Ln(m). i • j = j • i implies (2m – 1) (i – j) ≡ 
0(mod n) choose j such that (|j – i|, n) = 1 which implies (2m – 1) ≡ zero(mod n). 
Hence Ln(m) is commutative in which case C(Ln(m)) = SC(Ln(m)) = Ln(m). If Ln(m) 
is non-commutative C(Ln(m)) = {e} = SC(Ln(m)). 
 
THEOREM 3.7.5: Let Ln(m) ∈ Ln where n is a prime. Then NZ(Ln(m)) = 
Z(Ln(m)) = {e}. 
 
Proof: If n is a prime we have NZ(Ln(m)) = Z(Ln(m)). So it is enough if we prove 
Z(Ln(m)) = {e}. 
 
We know SZ(L) = S(NCL) ∩ SC(L) = N(L) ∩ C(L) (if n is a prime) = {e} by our 
earlier results.

3.8. Smarandache mixed direct product of loops 
 
In this section we define a new notion called Smarandache mixed direct product of 
loops and prove these loops got as Smarandache mixed direct product are S-loops. 
We define S-loop II. Using the definition of Smarandache mixed product we are able 

 
79 
to get the Smarandache Cauchy theorem for S-loops. Further in this section we extend 
two classical concepts, call them as Smarandache Lagrange criteria and Smarandache 
Sylow criteria. These are substantiated by examples. In fact for each of these concepts 
we have a class of loops, which satisfies it. Finally we give several problems to the 
reader as exercise to solve. As solving of these problems alone can make the reader 
get a deeper understanding of S-loops.  
 
DEFINITION 3.8.1: Let L = L1 × Sn be the direct product of a loop and a group. 
We call this the Smarandache mixed direct product of loops (S-mixed direct 
product of loops). We insist that L is a loop and one of L1 or Sn is group. We do not 
take all groups in the S-mixed direct product or all loops in this product. Further 
we can extend this to any number of loops and groups that is if L = L1 × L2 × … × 
Ln where some of the Li's are loops and some of them are groups. Then L is called 
the S-mixed direct product of n-terms. 
 
THEOREM 3.8.1: Let L = L1 × L2 be the direct product of a loop and a group be a 
S-mixed direct product of loops. Then L is a loop. 
 
Proof: By the very definition of S-mixed product we see one of L1 or L2 is a group. So L 
= L1 × L2 under component wise operation can at most be a loop and never a group 
as one of L1 or L2 is a loop; so the operation is non-associative that is L1 × L2 = {(m1, 
m2) / m1 ∈ L1 and m2 ∈ L2}. 
 
COROLLARY 3.8.1: Let L = L1 × … × Ln = {(m1, m2, … , mn) / mi ∈ Li; i = 1, 2, 
… , n} where some of the Li's are loops and some of the Li's are groups. L is a S-
mixed direct product of loops and L is a loop under component wise operation. 
Now because of this S-mixed direct product alone we are in a position to get 
Cayley's theorem for Smarandache loops.  
 
THEOREM 3.8.2: Let L = L1 × … × Ln be a S- mixed direct product of loops, then 
L is a Smarandache loop. 
 
Proof: Given L = L1 × … × Ln is a S-mixed direct product of loops so we have one of 
the Li is a group. Thus in the loop L we have {(e1, e2, … ei–1, mi, ei+1, … , en) such that 
mi ∈ Li and each ej is the identity element of Lj for j = 1, 2, … , n} = Hi. It is easily 
verified Hi is a proper subset of L, which is a group. So, L is a S-loop. 
 
Example 3.8.1: Let L = L5(2) × S3 = {(m, p)/ m ∈ L5(2) and p ∈ S3}. L is a loop in 
fact a S-loop. It is easily checked L is a non-commutative loop but L is a S-
commutative loop but L is not a S-strongly commutative loop. 
 
In fact L is not a Hamiltonian loop and L may not have S- subloops and may or may 
not have S-normal subloops. This leads to the following. 

 
80 
 
THEOREM 3.8.3: Let L = L1 × L2, be a S-mixed direct product of loops with L1 a 
loop and L2 a group. The loop L is not S-simple. (This is as in the case of direct 
product of groups where we have in case of direct product of groups have normal 
subgroups. Similarly S-mixed direct product of loops contain S-normal subloop 
that is L is not simple). 
 
Proof: Let L = L1 × L2, clearly H = {(m1, e2) | m1 ∈ L1 and e2 ∈ L2, the identity element 
of L2} is a S-normal subloop of L. Hence the claim.  
 
DEFINITION 3.8.2: Let L be a loop. H a subgroup of L. H is said to be a normal 
subgroup of L if H = aHa
-1 for all a ∈ L.  
 
THEOREM 3.8.4: Let L = L1 × L2 be a Smarandache mixed direct product of loop. 
The loop L has a normal subgroup. 
 
Proof: Given L = L1 × L2 is a S-loop, where L1 is a loop and L2 is a group. Let N = {(e1, 
g2) | e1 is the identity of the loop L1 and g2 ∈ L2}. Clearly N is a normal subgroup in L. 
This concept forces us and paves way for the definition of Smarandache loops of level 
II. 
 
DEFINITION 3.8.3: Let L be a loop, if L has a non-empty subset A of L which is a 
normal subgroup in L then we say L is a Smarandache loop of level II denoted by 
S-loop II. 
 
THEOREM 3.8.5: Let L be a S-loop of level II then L is a S-loop of level I that is L 
is a S-loop (by default of notation when we say S-loop it is implied that it is a S-
loop I). 
 
Proof: Clearly if L is a S-loop II. L has a proper subset A such that A is normal 
subgroup under the operation of L. So A is a subgroup under the operations of L. 
Hence the claim. 
 
THEOREM 3.8.6: Every S-loop need not in general be a S-loop II. 
 
Proof: By an example, consider the loop L5(2) given by the following table

Clearly A1 = {e, 1}, A2 = {e, 2}, A3 = {e, 3}, A4 = {e, 4} and A5 = {e, 5} are the only 
subgroups of L5(2). But it is easily verified that none of them are normal subgroups of 
L5(2). So L5(2) is not a S-loop II but is a S-loop. 
 
Example 3.8.2: Let L = L5(2) × S3, L is a S-loop II. For H = {(e1, p1) | e1 ∈ L5(2) is 
the identity element of L and pi ∈ S3} is a normal subgroup of L. Also take

the normal subgroup contained in S3. Then K = {(e1, p1) | e1 is the identity element of 
L5(2) and pi ∈ P} is a normal subgroup of L. 
 
THEOREM 3.8.7: All S-mixed direct product loops L are S-loop II. 
 
Proof: Obvious from the fact L is a direct product of both loops and groups if LK is a 
group in the direct product then in L = L1 × … × Ln we have H = {(e1, e2, … , gk, …, 
en) | gk ∈ Lk, ei ∈ Li for i ≠ k and i = 1, 2, … , n are the identity elements in Li}. H is a 
normal subgroup of L. So L is a S-loop II.  
 
We will discuss about S-loop II separately later in this book. Now we are initiating to 
get some analogue of the classical Cayley's theorem for groups to S-loops. Cayley's 
theorem states "Every group is isomorphic to a subgroup of Sn for some appropriate 
n". (where Sn is the group of permutation of n elements i.e. symmetric group of 
degree n need not be finite unless specified).  
 
Now an analogue of Cayley's theorem for S-loops, that is, the Smarandache Cayley 
theorem for S-loops. 
 
THEOREM 3.8.8 (S-Cayley theorem for S-loops): Every S-loop is S-isomorphic to 
a S-loop got from the S-mixed direct product of loops. 
 
Proof: Given L is a S-loop; so L contains a proper subset A where A is a group. Now 
consider the S-mixed direct product loop L' = L1 × … × Lk where one of Li is itself the 
group A or a Li is a group containing A as a subgroup. The latter is also possible by 
the classical Cayley's theorem for groups. So we can always define a S-isomorphism 
from L to L'. Hence the theorem. This theorem will be called Smarandache Cayley 
theorem for S-loops. 
 
Thus our S-mixed direct product of loops and S-isomorphism of loops help us to get a 
Cayley's theorem for S-loops. 
 

 
82 
The next natural question would be can we have the classical Lagranges' theorem for 
S-loops. The answer is yes only for the S-loops built using S-mixed direct product 
loops. Thus we call this concept the Smarandache Lagrange theorem. 
 
DEFINITION 3.8.4: Let L be a finite S-loop if the order of every subgroup 
divides the order of L then we say S satisfies the Smarandache Lagrange's criteria 
for S-loops. (If L is not a S-loop there is no meaning for this condition. Secondly 
it is not a must all S-loops must satisfy the Smarandache Lagranges criteria but 
we have a class of loops which satisfies the S-Lagranges criteria.) 
 
Example 3.8.3 : Let L5(2) be a S-loop of order 6. It is easily verified every subgroup 
in L5(2) is of order 2 and 2/6. Hence L5(2) satisfies the S-Lagranges criteria. A natural 
question would be does the order of every subgroup divide the order of the loop L 
where L is a finite loop. 
 
The answer to this question is now by an example. 
 
Example 3.8.4 : Consider the loop L45(8). This is a loop of order 46. Clearly  H = 
{e, 1, 16, 31} is a subgroup of L45(8). Clearly 4 / 46. Hence the claim. But we have 
class of S-loops which satisfies the S-Lagranges criteria. 
 
THEOREM 3.8.9 : Every S-loop in the class of loops Ln where n is an odd prime 
greater than 3 satisfies S-Lagranges criteria. 
 
Proof: Given Ln(m) ∈ Ln where n is an odd prime. So each Ln(m) can have at most n-
subgroups of order 2 and no subgroups of any other order. Further |Ln(m)| = n + 1 
= even, we see S-Lagranges criteria is satisfied by the class of loops. 
 
Thus for every prime n > 3, we see we have classes of loops satisfying S-Lagrange 
criteria. Do we have any other loop which satisfy S-Lagranges criteria the answer is 
yes. 
 
THEOREM 3.8.10 : Let L = L1 × … × Ln where each Li is finite and one of the Li 
is a group. Let Ln be the group. Assume no Li is a S-loop that is no loop Li has a 
proper subset which is a group. Then L = L1 × … × Ln satisfies S-Lagrange 
criteria.  
 
Proof: Obvious by the very definition of L. It is left for the reader to verify S-Lagrange 
criteria. Clearly |L|  = |L1| × |L2| × … × |Ln| and by our classical Lagranges theorem 
for groups each subgroup of Lr divides the order of Lr. As only Lr has subgroups and Lr 
is a finite group the result is true.  
 
On similar lines we define Smarandache Sylow criteria.  
 

 
83 
DEFINITION 3.8.5: Let L be a finite loop. If for every prime p/|L| the loop L has a 
subgroup of order p or a subgroup of a power of p then we say the loop L satisfies 
Smarandache Sylow (S-Sylow) criteria.  
 
Example 3.8.5: Let L = L5(2) × S3 be a S-mixed direct product loop. |L| = 36. 2/36 
and 3/36. L has subgroups of order two and order 3 so L satisfies S-Sylow criteria. 
 
Example 3.8.6: Let L =L5(2), |L5(2)| = 6 does not satisfy S-Sylow criteria for L5(2) 
does not have any subgroup of order 3.  
 
It is interesting to note that L = L5 (2) × S3   satisfies S-Sylow criteria but L5(2) does not 
satisfy S-Sylow criteria. This is a very unique property solely enjoyed by the S-mixed 
direct product alone. For in case of all algebraic structures with their product this is 
impossible as even in case of lattice if one lattice is non-distributive, another 
distributive the direct product gives only a non-distributive lattice. But S-mixed direct 
product has enabled us to overcome this problem.  
 
Another natural question would be does all loops of Ln(m) ∈ Ln never satisfy S-Sylow 
criteria. The answer is not so by an example.  
 
Example 3.8.7: Let L7(2) be a loop. Clearly L7(2) has only subgroups of order 2 
only in fact 7 groups of order 2. |L7(2)|| = 8 = 2
3. 2/8. Hence all loops in L7 satisfy S-
Sylow criteria. Thus this class of loops L7 satisfy S-Sylow criteria.  
 
One more problem is can we say only Ln when n is a prime can give loops which 
satisfy S-Sylow criteria. The answer is no. For by another example.  
 
Example 3.8.8: Let L11(2) ∈ L11 is a loop of order 12, 2/12 and 3/12. L11(2) has no 
subgroups of order 3 but L11(2) ∈ L11 where 11 is a prime. L11(2) does not satisfy S-
Sylow criteria. 
 
Example 3.8.9: Let L15(8) ∈L15 be a loop of order 16. Only 2/16 and L15(8) has 
subgroups of order 2. Hence L15(8) satisfies S-Sylow criteria.  
 
THEOREM 3.8.11: Let Ln(m) ∈ Ln if n is equal 2
r – 1. Then |Ln(m)| = 2
r so that 
every loop in the class 
1
2r
L
− satisfies S-Sylow criteria.  
Proof: Obvious form the very definition of S-Sylow criteria and the fact |Ln(m)| = 2
r so 
only 2 is the prime which divides |Ln(m)|. Hence the claim.  
 
In view of this we have the following. Let Ln(m) ∈ Ln be a loop in Ln if n is not of the 
form 2
r – 1 then can we say Ln(m) does not satisfy S-Sylow criteria? We have several 
examples in support of this.  
 

 
84 
Example 3.8.10: Let L = L9(2) × S3. L is S-loop which does not satisfy S-Sylow 
criteria.  
 
THEOREM 3.8.12: Let L = Ln(m) × Sn+1 be the S-mixed direct product loop. Then 
L satisfies S-Sylow criteria.  
 
Proof: Since |Sn+ 1| = (n+1)! so all prime factors of |Ln(m)| = n + 1 are also factors of 
(n + 1)! So obviously L will satisfy S-Sylow criteria.  
 
This is the least condition we can have so that the S-mixed direct product of the loop 
Ln(m) ∈ Ln satisfies S-Sylow criteria.  
 
PROBLEMS:  
 
1. 
Give an example of a loop of order 15 which does not satisfy S-Lagrange 
criteria. 
2. 
Find an example of a S-loop of order 21 which has both 7-Sylow subgroup and 
3-Sylow subgroup. 
3. 
Does there exist a loop of order 21 which does not satisfy both S-Sylow criteria 
and S-Lagranges criteria?  
4. 
Will it be possible for all S-mixed direct product loops to satisfy S-Lagrange 
criteria? Justify your answer. 
5. 
Let L = L13(2) × G (where G = 〈g / g
7 = 1〉 is the S-mixed direct product of 
loops. Does L satisfy S-Lagranges criteria? Will L satisfy S-Sylow criteria? 
6. 
Give an example of a S-loop II of order 26. 
7. 
Give an example of a S-loop of order 25 which is not a S-loop II. 
8. 
Can we say all prime order loops are not S-loops? 
9. 
Is every S-mixed direct product of loop a S-loop II? 
 
 
3.9. Smarandache cosets in loops 
 
In this section we study and introduce the Smarandache coset representation in loops 
when the loop has a subgroup i.e. only when L is a S-loop. This section defines 
Smarandache right (left) coset of H in L. Several interesting examples are given like 
cosets in a group, Smarandache cosets does not in general partition the loop or have 
some nice representation. All these are explained by self-illustrative examples.  
 
This problem leads to the definition of Smarandache right (left) coset equivalence 
sets in a loop L related to a subgroup A of L. In chapter 5 several problems are given 
for the interested reader to develop an interest and carry out research on the 
Smarandache cosets of loops. 
 

 
85 
DEFINITION 3.9.1: Let L be a S-loop. We define Smarandache right cosets (S-
right cosets) in L as follows:  
 
Let A ⊂ L be the subgroup of L and for m ∈ L we have Am = {am/a ∈ A}. Am is 
called a S-right coset of A in L.  
 
Similarly we can for any subgroup A of L define Smarandache left coset (S-left 
coset) for some m ∈ L as mA = {ma / a ∈ A}. If the loop L is commutative then 
only we have mA = Am. Even if L is S-commutative or S-strongly commutative 
still we need not have Am = mA for all m ∈ L.  
 
Example 3.9.1: Let L5(2) be the non-commutative loop given by the following table:

Let A = {e, 1} be the subgroup of the S-loop L5(2). The S-right coset of A is  
 
A • 1 = {e, 1}  
A • 2 = {2, 3} 
A • 3 = {3, 5}  
A • 4 = {4, 2} 
A • 5 = {5, 4} 
 
 
Thus the S-right cosets do not partition L5(2).  
 
Consider the S-left cosets of A 
 
1 • A = {e, 1}  
2 • A = {5, 2} 
3 • A = {3, 4}  
4 • A = {4, 3} 
5 • A = {5,2} 
 
But the S-left cosets has partitioned L5(2). Thus we cannot make any comment about 
the partition.

Let A = {e, 5}, consider S-right coset of A.  
 
A • 1 = {1, 3}  
A • 2 = {2, 7} 
A • 3 = {3, 4}  
A • 4 = {4, 1} 
A • 5 = {5, 1}  
A • 6 = {6, 2} 
A • 7 = {7, 6} 
 
Clearly A does not partition L5(2).  
 
Take A = {e, 5} consider S-left coset of A  
 
1 • A = {1, 3}  
2 • A = {2, 7} 
3 • A = {3, 4}  
4 • A = {4, 1} 
5 • A = {5, 1}  
6 • A = {6, 2} 
7 • A = {6, 7} 
 
Clearly S-cosets do not get partitioned in this case. But mA = Am for all m ∈ L7(4) as 
L7(4) is a commutative loop.  
 
Take B = {e, 4} 
 
B • 1 = {1, 6}  
B • 2 = {2, 3} 
B • 3 = {3, 7}  
B • 5 = {5, 1} 
B • 6 = {6, 5}  
B • 7 = {7, 2} 
 
This also does not partition L7(4). Clearly Bm = mB. Just we have seen for the new 
class of loops; the S-right coset and S-left coset when the loop is non-commutative 
and the loop is commutative.  
 
In both these loops we do not have subgroups of other order. But one of the 
important observations which is made by these problems are: 

 
87 
 
We have a set of elements in L5(2) such that the set with a specified subgroup A gives 
coset decomposition in a disjoint way which is a partition of L5(2). For example in the 
loop L5(2) we have for the subgroup A, the elements {2, 5} and {3, 4} in L5(2) are 
such that we get L5(2) = A ∪ A • 2 ∪ A • 5 i.e. {1. e} ∪ {2, 3} ∪ {4. 5} = L5(2) 
which is a disjoint union. Further using the set of elements {3, 4} we see L5(2) = A ∪ 
A • 3 ∪ A • 4 = {1, e} ∪ {3, 5} ∪ {4, 2}.   
 
So unlike in a group we are able to divide the loop into equivalence classes not using 
all elements but at the same time we cannot say the two sets partition in the same way.  
 
This is possible only when the loop is a non-commutative one for the loop L7(4) 
which is a commutative loop we are not able to get any such relation. So one more 
relevant question would be should n of the loop Ln(m) be a prime number? We will 
first illustrate examples before we try to answer these questions.   
 
Example 3.9.3: Consider the non-commutative loop L7(3) given by the following 
table:

Let A1 = {1, e}, 2A1 = {6, 2}, 3A1 = {3, 4}, 4A1 = {4, 2}, 5A1 = {5, 7}, 6A1 = {6, 5} 
and 7A1 = {7, 3}.  
 
S-right coset decomposition by A1 is A1 = {1, e}, A12 = {2, 4}, A13 = {3,7}, A14 = {4, 
3}, A15 = {5, 6}, A16 = {6, 2} and A17 = {7, 5}. The set {2, 3, 5} and {4, 6, 7} are 
such that L7(3) = A1 ∪ {2, 4} ∪ {3, 7} ∪ {5,6} = A1 ∪ A12 ∪ A13 ∪ A15. Similarly 
L7(3) = A1 ∪ A14 ∪ A16 ∪ A17 = {e, 1} ∪ {4, 3} ∪ {6, 2} ∪ {7, 5}.  
 
S-left coset decomposition by A1 is A1= {1, e}, 2A1 = {6, 3}, 3A1 = {3, 4}, 4A1 = {4, 
2}, 5A1 ={5, 7}, 6A1 = {6, 5} and 7A1 = {7, 3}. Here also the set {2, 3, 5} and {4, 6, 
7} are such that L7(3) = A1 ∪ 2A1 ∪ 3A1 ∪ 5A1 = {e, 1} ∪ {2, 6} ∪ {3, 4} ∪ {5, 7}.  
 

 
88 
L7(3) = A1 ∪ 4A1 ∪6A1 ∪ 7A1 = {e, 1} ∪ {4, 2} ∪ {6, 5} ∪ {3, 7}. The chief thing 
to be noticed is that for the same subgroup the sets associated with the S-left coset 
and S-right coset are the same.  
 
Consider A2 = {e, 4}. S-right coset decomposition by A2. A2 = {e, 4}, A2 • 1 = {1, 2}, 
A2 • 2 = {2, 5}, A2 • 3 = {3, 1}, A2 • 5 = {5, 7}, A2 • 6 = {6, 3} and A27 = {7, 6}.  
 
{2, 3, 7} and {1, 5, 6} are such that we have L7(3) = A2 ∪ A2 • 2 ∪ A2 • 3 ∪ A2 • 7 = 
{e, 4} ∪ {2, 5} ∪ {3, 1} ∪ {6,  7} and L3(7) = {e, 4} ∪ {1, 2} ∪ {5, 7} ∪ {3, 6} = 
A2 ∪ A21 ∪ A25 ∪ A26.  
 
Thus we see depending on the subgroup the sets also differ but we have two sets or 
two decompositions by A2 or by any subgroup in L7(3). Now we will see the problem 
when n = odd non-prime.

Take A = {e, 7} as the subgroup of L9(8).  
 
The S-right coset decomposition by A is A • 1 = {1, 4}, A • 2 = {2, 3}, A • 3 = {3, 
2}, A • 4 = {4, 1}, A5 = {5, 9}, A6 = {6, 8}, A • 8 = {8, 6} and A • 9 = {5, 9}. Thus 
in this case we see a nice coset decomposition into partition and into classes. {1, 2, 6, 
5} and {4, 3, 8, 9}. Here the nicety is  
 
A • 1 = A • 4 
A • 2 = A • 3 
A • 5 = A • 9 
A • 6 = A • 8 
 

 
89 
Thus it is verified L9(8) is got as a disjoint union of cosets. Now take the subgroup of 
order 4. B = {e, 1, 4, 7}. Find the S-right coset decomposition by B.  
 
B • 2 = {2, 9, 6, 3} 
B • 8 – {8, 3, 9, 6} 
B • 5 = {5, 6, 3, 9} 
B • 3 = {3, 8, 5, 2} 
B • 6 = {6, 5, 2, 8} 
B • 9 = {9, 2, 8, 5} 
 
So we in case of subgroups of order four this does not work out by this illustration.  
 
Now we get a loop still of higher order say L15(14) and study the coset representation 
of their subgroups. We will consider the coset representation of the subgroup A = {e, 
4} 
 
 
A • 1 = {1, 7}  
 
A • 2 = {2, 6} 
 
A • 3 = {3, 5}  
 
A • 5 = {5, 3} 
 
A • 6 = {6, 2}  
 
A • 7 = {7, 1} 
 
A • 8 = {8, 15} 
 
A • 9 = {9, 14} 
 
A • 10 = {10, 13} 
 
A • 11 = {11, 12} 
 
A • 12 = {12, 11} 
 
A • 13 = {13, 10} 
 
A • 14 = {14, 9} 
 
A • 15 = {15, 8} 
 
Thus the two sets {1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10, 11} and {5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15} are such that 
L15(14) has a unique decomposition as union of right cosets by these two sets.  
 
Consider the left coset representation by A = {e, 4} 
 
 
1 • A = {1, 13} 
 
2 • A = {2, 15} 
3 • A = {3, 2}  
 
5 • A = {5, 6} 
6 • A = {6, 8}  
 
7 • A = {7, 10} 
8 • A = {8, 12} 
 
9 • A = {9, 14} 
10 • A = {10, 1} 
 
11 • A = {11, 3} 
12 • A = {12, 5} 
 
13 • A = {13, 7} 
14 • A = {14, 9} 
 
15 • A = {15, 11} 
 
 
{1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 15} and {2, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14} are such that those cosets 
representations given by the loop L15(4). But we see the sets for the S-right coset is 
different from the sets for the S-left coset. These observations helps us to define the 
following:  

 
90 
 
DEFINITION 3.9.2: Let L be a loop, A a subgroup of L such that B = {x1 … xt} be 
the subset of L with 
U
t
1
i
i
Ax
L
=
=
(Axi ∩ Axj = φ, i ≠ j) and let C = {y1, …yt} a 
subset of L such that 
U
t
1
i
i
Ay
L
=
=
 (Ayi ∩ Ayj = φ, i ≠ j) further C ∩ B = φ.  
 
Then we say the set C and B are Smarandache right coset equivalent subsets (S-
right coset equivalent subsets) of L related to the subgroup A with S-right coset 
representation.  
 
Similarly we define Smarandache left coset equivalent subsets (S-left coset 
equivalent subsets) of L related to the subgroup A with S-left coset representation.  
 
It is pertinent to note in general the S-right coset equivalent subsets of the group A 
need not be the same as S-left coset equivalent subsets of A. Further it is very essential 
to note that we are not in general guaranteed of such decomposition. This is also well 
illustrated by examples. We do think if L happens to be a commutative loop we may 
not in general have such S-right coset equivalent subsets i.e. representation of L as L 
= U
t
1
i
i
Ax
=
may not be possible with Axi ∩ Axj = φ if i ≠ j.  
 
We define the decomposition whenever it exists as the Smarandache right (left) coset 
representation of the loop L relative to the subgroup A of L. We have proposed several 
research problems for the reader in this direction which is given in Chapter 5.  
 
PROBLEMS: 
 
1. Find for the loop L5(4) the S-left and S-right coset decomposition relative to 
the subgroup A = {1, 4}. 
2. For the loop L11(3) find the S-left coset representation of A = {e, 5}. Find also 
the S-right coset representation related to A = {e, 5}. Are the equivalent set of 
S-right coset same as S-left coset. 
3. Find for the same loop L11(3) when A = {e, 8} the S-right coset and S-left 
coset. Compare it with problem 2.  
4. Does a loop of odd order have a subgroup A such that it has S-right or S-left 
coset representation? Illustrate with examples.  
5. Find for the subgroup A = {e, 8} in L45(8) the S-left (right) coset 
representation.  
6. For the subgroup {e, 7} of L45(8) find S-left (right) coset representation.  
7. Compare problems 6 and 5; also find for B = {e, 38} the S-left (right) coset 
representation.  

 
91 
 
 
3.10. Some special type of Smarandache loops 
 
In this section we introduce 3 special types of S-loops some of them very recently 
studied by M. K. Kinyon [41] viz. we define Smarandache RIF loops, Smarandache 
ARIF loops and Smarandache Steiner loops. We prove using the result of M. K. Kinyon 
[41, 42] certain odd order Moufang loops are S-loops. 
 
THEOREM 3.10.1: All small Frattini Moufang loops (SFM-loops) are S-loops.  
 
Proof: Clearly SMF loops are Moufang p-loop L with a central subgroup Z of order p 
(Tim Hsu [63]). Hence SMF loops are S-loops.  
 
DEFINITION 3.10.1: A Smarandache RIF loop is a loop L which has a S-subloop 
A, such that A is a RIF-loop.  
 
So we see a Smarandache RIF loop need not be a RIF loop. Further when we say A 
is a S-subloop we do not include the condition that A can be a subgroup of L.  
 
DEFINITION 3.10.2: Smarandache ARIF loop is a loop (S-ARIF loop) L which 
has a S-subloop A which is a ARIF loop by itself. Thus we do not need L to be a 
ARIF loop only if a S-subloop of L happens to be a ARIF loop then we say L is a S-
ARIF loop.  
 
Thus only from the results of M. Kinyon 2001 [41], we see ARIF loops are S-ARIF 
loop further we get a class of odd order Moufang loops which are S-loops. Without 
this we would be pondering for odd order S-loops.  
 
Steiner loops arise naturally in combinations, since they correspond uniquely to 
Steiner triple systems, specifically the Steiner loop L corresponds to the triple systems 
{{x, y, xy}: x ≠ y and x, y ≠ 1} on L \ {1} but we may have in a loop L  which has a  
proper subloop to  satisfy the conditions for it to be a Steiner loop. So we are once 
again necessitated to define Smarandache – Steiner loops.  
 
DEFINITION 3.10.3: Let L be a loop, L is said to be a Smarandache Steiner loop 
(S-Steiner loop) if L contains a S-subloop A such that A is a Steiner loop. 
 
As RIF loops includes Steiner loops we have S-Steiner loops (please refer M.K.Kinyon 
[41]) 
 
PROBLEMS: 
 
1. Can any of the loops in the class Ln be S-Steiner loops? 
2. Can any of the loops in the class Ln be S-RIF loops? 

 
92 
3. Does the class of loops Ln have S-ARIF loops? If so give example. 
4. Give an example of a loop L which is not a Steiner loop but a S-Steiner loop. 
5. Explain by an example a loop which is not a ARIF loop but is a S-ARIF loop. 
6. Does their exist a S-RIF loop which is not a RIF loop? 
7. Find a loop of even order which is Moufang and at the same time S-RIF loop.

Chapter four 
PROPERTIES ABOUT S-LOOPS 
 
In this chapter we deal mainly with S-loops II, define S-subloop II, Smarandache 
Moufang loops II and likewise all loops which satisfy an identity. In section 1 we 
define S-loops of level II to satisfy special identities. In the second section, 
Smarandache homomorphisms of level II are defined. Also Smarandache Nuclei II etc 
are defined. Section 3 is fully devoted to the Smarandache representation of S-loop II. 
The Smarandache isotopes are studied in section 4. The final section is completely 
utilized to the study of S-hyperloops, S-A-hyperloops. This study can be restricted only 
to the class of new loops as the hyperstructure have meaning only when they are 
integers modulo n. Every section ends with a list of problems for the reader to solve. 
 
 
4.1 Smarandache loops of level II 
 
This section is devoted to study properties of S-loop II by defining it as in the case of 
S-loop I. We do not claim that all properties, which have been defined and studied for 
S-loop I have been introduced and studied in the case of S-loop II in this chapter. 
What we mainly aim in this chapter is to sketch some definitions and properties of S-
loops II as we assume the reader may try many analogous results. Just for the sake of 
completeness we recall the definition of Smarandache loops of level II and do not 
think it is a repetition. 
 
DEFINITION 4.1.1: Let L be a loop, L is said to be a Smarandache loop of level II 
if L has a normal subgroup. (A ⊂ L where A is a subgroup of L such that mA = Am 
for all m ∈ L is a normal subgroup.)  
 
Several properties were dealt in the chapter 3. Here we view it in a different way and 
distinct from the results derived in chapter 3.  
 
DEFINITION 4.1.2: Let L be a loop. We say L has a Smarandache subloop II (S-
subloop II) if A ⊂ L is a S-loop II that is A is a subloop and has a normal 
subgroup B in it. (We do not demand B to a normal subgroup of L it is sufficient 
that if B happens to be a normal subgroup in A). 
 
THEOREM 4.1.1: Let L be a loop if L has a S-subloop II L need not be a S-loop II 
but it is a S-loop.  
 
Proof: From the very definition of S-subloop II we need L to contain a subloop, A 
which has a normal subgroup relative to A. So we can say L has a subgroup, hence L 

 
94 
is S-loop. But in general it need not be a S-loop II as B ⊂ A, which is a normal 
subgroup of A, B may not be a normal subgroup in L.  
 
We obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for a loop L to have a S-subloop II and 
L to be a S-loop II. 
 
THEOREM 4.1.2: Let L be a loop and A be a S-subloop II. L is a S-loop II only if 
at least one of the normal subgroups in a S-subloop II is a normal subgroup of L. 
 
Proof: The proof is simple and the reader is advised to give the proof of this theorem. 
 
DEFINITION 4.1.3: Let L be a loop. L is said to be a Smarandache Moufang loop 
of level II (S-Moufang loop II) if L has a S-subloop II, A ⊂ L such that (xy) (zx) = 
(x (yz)) x for all x, y, z ∈ A. Clearly even if L is a Moufang loop still L may fail to 
be a Smarandache Moufang loop II for L may not contain any normal subgroups. 
This is once again a main deviation from the definition of S-Moufang loops. 
 
On similar lines we define Smarandache Bol loop of level II, Smarandache Bruck 
loop of level II, Smarandache di-associative loop of level II and Smarandache 
power associative loop of level II. We see none of these properties (say Bol) held 
by a loop guarantees of it to be a Smarandache Bol loop of level II. 
 
DEFINITION 4.1.4: Let L be a loop, L is said to be a Smarandache weak inverse 
property loop (S-WIP loop) II if L has a S-subloop II A(A ⊂ L) such that (xy) z = e 
imply x(yz) = e for all x, y, z ∈ A, e identity element of L. 
 
Example 4.1.1: Let L = L5(2) × S3 be a S-loop II and L1 = L7(2) × S4 be a S-loop II. 
We have a map φ: A → A1 where A = {e} × A3 and A1 = {e} × A4 we have φ: A → A1 is 
a S-homomorphism.  
 
Example 4.1.2: Let L = L5(2) × S3 and L1 = L9(5) × G where G = 〈g / g
3 = 1〉 be any 
two S-loop II. We see L1 and L are S-isomorphic loops. We say two S-loop II are 
isomorphic. So for two S-loop II to be S-isomorphic it is not essential the loops must 
be of same order. So two S-loop II are isomorphic if the two loops have normal 
subgroups of same order which are isomorphic as groups.  
 
DEFINITION 4.1.5: Let L be a loop, L is said to be a Smarandache ARIF loop of 
level II (S-ARIF II) if L has a subset A which is a S-subloop II i.e. B ⊂ A is a normal 
subgroup of A, and A is a ARIF loop.  
 
THEOREM 4.1.3: Every commutative ARIF loop is a S-ARIF loop II. 
 
Proof: Follows from the very definition and the nature of commutativity and the fact 
every ARIF loop is a diassociative.  

 
95 
 
We define S-representation of loops level II and the concept of S-principal isotopes of 
level II relative to S-subloops II. It is left for the reader to study and analyse these 
concepts in an analogous way as it was done for S-loops. Finally it is for the reader to 
solve these properties of S-loop II and differentiate it from S-loop I. 
 
The natural or the classical question would be the study of lattice of subloops of S-
loop II, lattice of S-subloops of S-loop II, the lattice of normal subgroups of S-loop II, 
and the lattice of subgroups of S-loop II. We first illustrate by examples.  
 
Example 4.1.3: Let L = L5(2) × S3 be the mixed product which is a S-loop II. The 
loop L has only one subloop given by A = L5(2) × {1} where {1} is the identity 
element of S3. The lattice of subloops of L has the following figure: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The lattice of S-subloops of L are B1 = L5(2) × {1}, B2 = L5(2) × {1, p1}, B3 = L5(2) × 
{1, p2}, B4 = L5(2) × {1, p3} and B5 = L5(2) × {1, p5, p4}. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The lattice of subgroups of L is given by Ci = {i, e} × {1}, C2 = {i, e} × {1, p1}, C3 = 
{i, e} × {1, p2}, C4 = {i, e} × {i, p3}, C5 = {i, e} × {1, p4, p5} and C6 = {1, e} × S3.    
 
L5(2) × {1} 
L 
{e} × {1} 
L 
B2 
B3 
B4 
B5 
{e}× {1} 
 

 
96 
We have 36 subgroups of this form together with L5(2) × S3. So we do not venture to 
draw the lattice diagram of these subgroups. We proceed on to find the normal 
subgroups of L, Do = {e} × {1}, D1 = {e} × {1, p4, p5} and D2 = {e}  × S 3 having the 
following lattice representation: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Example 4.1.4: To study only the subgroups of a S-loop we take the following 
simple example L, where L = L5(3) × G, here G = 〈g / g
19 = 1〉. Clearly L is a S-loop II.  
 
The subgroups of L are: Ao = {e} × {1},  A1 = {e, 1} × {1} , A2 = {e} × {1}, A3 = {e, 
3} × {1}, A4 = {e, 4} × {1}, A5 = {e, 5} × {1}, A6 = {e} × G, A7 = {e, 1} × G, A8 = {e, 
2} × G, A9 = {e, 3} × G, A10 = {e, 4} × G, A11 = {e, 5} × G together with the largest 
element L for the lattice is to be formed with 13 elements.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This lattice is also non-modular. Thus the study of lattice formation of subgroups, S-
subloops, normal subgroups of the S-loop II is an interesting one as we cannot make 
any decision about the structure of these lattices.

THEOREM 4.1.7: Let Ln(m) ∈ Ln n a prime. If Ln(m) × G where G is a cyclic 
group of order p, p a prime, then we have 2p + 3 = 2n + 3 subgroups forming a 
non-modular non-distributive lattice.  
 
Proof: We have n = p, p a prime. Ai = {e, i} × {1} for i = 1, 2, …, p gives p-
subgroups. Bi = {e,  i} × G for i = 1, 2, …, p gives another p-subgroups. Take A = 
{e} × {1}, B = {e} × G and L = Ln(m) × G. Thus we have 2p + 3 subgroups with the 
following lattice diagram:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
which is easily verified to be a non-distributive non-modular lattice.

4.2 Properties of S- loop II 
 
In this section we define Smarandache loop homomorphism of level II and study the 
concept of Nuclei, centre, Moufang centre for S-loops II, we also define Smarandache 
Lagrange criteria II and Smarandache Sylow criteria II in case of S-loops II. It is left 
for the reader to develop relevant analogue for S-loop II using S-loops. 
 
DEFINITION 4.2.1: Let L and L' be two S-loop II. We say a map φ : L to L' is a 
Smarandache loop homomorphism II if φ: A → A' where A and A' are normal 
subgroups of L and L' respectively and φ is a group homomorphism from A to A'. 
 
We define Smarandache isomorphism II and Smarandache automorphism II from L to 
L' in a similar way.  
 
Note: We cannot get any S-loop homomorphism II from a S-loop II to S-loop if the S-
loop is not a S-loop II. Here we proceed to define Moufang centre, nuclei etc in case 
of S-loop II.  
 
DEFINITION 4.2.2: Let L be a loop. A be a S-subloop II of L. Then Smarandache 
left Nucleus II of loop L is defined as SS(Nλ) = {a ∈ A / (a, x, y) = e for all x, y ∈ 
A} is a subloop of A.  
 
Similarly we define SS(Nµ) and SS(Nρ) the Smarandache middle nucleus II and 
Smarandache right nucleus II respectively. 
 
DEFINITION 4.2.3: Let L be a loop. SSN(L) the Smarandache nucleus II is 
defined to be SSN(L) = SS(Nλ) ∩ SS(Nµ) ∩ SS(Nρ). If the loop L has no S-subloop 
II but L is itself a S-loop II then we replace the S-subloop by the S-loop II itself in 
which case we have SS(Nλ) = Nλ, SS(Nµ) = Nµ and so on. 
 
DEFINITION 4.2.4: Let L be a loop. The Smarandache Moufang centre II of L is 
defined relative to the S-subloop II A, as SSC(L) = {x ∈ A/ xy = yx for all y ∈ A}. 
If L has no S-subloop II but L is a S-loop II then we replace A by L itself in which 
case SSC(L) = C(L). 
 

 
99 
DEFINITION 4.2.5: Let L be a loop, A ⊂ L be the S-subloop II, the centre of the 
loop L; SSZ(L) = SSC(L) ∩ SSN(L). If L does not have a S-subloop II but L is itself 
a S-loop II then replace A by L. Now we see in case of S-loop II we can have like S-
loops several S-nuclei II, S-centre II, S-Moufang centre II but unlike loops which 
has a unique nucleus, centre, Moufang centre and so on. 
 
Now one more question is Smarandache Lagrange criteria II (S-Lagrange criteria II) 
and Smarandache Sylow criteria II. We define these two concepts and leave all the 
properties about S-loops II to the reader. 
 
DEFINITION 4.2.6: Let L be a finite S-loop II. L is said to satisfy Smarandache 
Lagrange criteria II if the order of every normal subgroup of L divides | L |. 
 
DEFINITION 4.2.7: Let S be a finite S-loop II. L is said to satisfy Smarandache 
Sylow criteria II if for every prime p / | L | there is a normal subgroup of order p. 
 
Similarly we define other related concepts for S-loops II.

S-Lagrange criteria II? 
ii. 
S-sylow criteria II?

subloop II? 
7. 
Do we have a loop of odd order in which for all S-subloops we have the same 
SSZ(L)?   
8. 
Find loop which has many S-subloops but a unique SN(L). 
9. 
Find a S-loop isomorphism of two loops of order 18 and order 28. 
 
 
4.3 Smarandache representation of a finite loop L 
 
In this section we introduce the concept of Smarandache representation of a finite 
loop, this definition is possible only when the loop has a S-subloop; other wise we 
have the concept of Smarandache pseudo representations only when L is a S-loop. 
Thus when L is not a S-loop we do not have any Smarandache representation for 
them. 
 

 
100 
DEFINITION 4.3.1: Let L be a finite loop. A be a S-subloop of L (A should not be 
a group). For α ∈ A we define a right multiplication Rα as a permutation of the 
subloop  A as follows: 
 
Rα: x → x • α we will call the set {Rα | α ∈ A} the Smarandache right regular 
representation (S-right regular representation) of the loop L or briefly the 
representation of L.  
 
If a loop L has no proper S-subloops then the loop cannot have Smarandache right 
regular representations. Thus for Smarandache right regular representation to 
exist for a loop L, L must have S-subloops. 
 
THEOREM 4.3.1: The class of loops Ln(m) ∈ Ln, n a prime are S-loops but have 
no S-subloops so these loops do not have S-right regular representation but has 
right regular representations. 
 
Proof: All loops Ln(m) ∈ Ln when n is a prime are S-loops for Ai = {e, i} is a subgroup 
for every i ∈ {1, 2, … , n}. But this class of loops do not have even subloops so all 
the more they do not have S-subloops. Hence we cannot speak of S- right regular 
representation for these loops.  
 
We illustrate the right regular representation of a loop from Ln(m) ∈ Ln when n is a 
prime. 
 
Example 4.3.1: Let L7(4)be a loop given by the following table:

The right regular representation of the loop L7(4) is 
 
I 
(e 1) (2 5 3) (4 6 7) 
(e 2) (1 5 7) (3 6 4) 
(e 3) (1 2 6) (4 7 5) 
(e 4) (1 6 5) (2 3 7) 

 
101 
(e 5) (1 3 4) (2 7 6) 
(e 6) (1 7 3) (2 4 5) 
(e 7) (1 4 2) (3 5 6) 
 
where I is the identity permutation of the loop L7(4). To overcome this problem we 
define Smarandache pseudo representation of loops. 
 
DEFINITION 4.3.2: Let L be a loop. Suppose L has no S-subloops only subgroups 
B then we define Smarandache pseudo representation (S-pseudo representation) 
of loops as the set {Rα | α ∈ B}. 
 
In the example 4.2.1 we see the loop has S-pseudo representation as every element 
generates a subgroup of order 2.  
 
Now we see some interesting properties satisfied by these representations. Let p1 = (e 
1) (2 5 3) (4 6 7) clearly 〈p1, e〉 generates a cyclic group of order 6. Consider p2 = 
(e 2) (1 5 7) (3 6 4), 〈p2, e〉 generates a cyclic group of order 6. Thus we are facing 
a situation in which each representation associated with each subgroup gives a cyclic 
group of order 6. Finally it can be checked that none of the permutation in the 
representation of L7(4) when producted gives a representation in the same set that is 
if {p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, p7, e} = P is the set, pi • pj ∉ P. 
 
Thus Smarandache pseudo permutations of a loop are so pseudo even closure cannot 
be contemplated. 
 
THEOREM 4.3.2: Let Ln(m) ∈ Ln and n an odd prime k is a fixed positive integer 
such that (m – 1)
k ≡ (–1)
k (mod n), then Ln(m) has only S-pseudo permutation 
and any permutation (a ≠ e) in the representation of Ln(m) is a product of a 2 
cycle and t, k-cycles where 
k
1
n
t
−
=
. 
 
Proof: The above example is a proof. Every S-pesudo representation is a product of a 
2 cycles where 
k

n
t
−
=
. Suppose take n = 11, m = 4 then m – 1 = 3 so in the loop 
L11(4) we have (m – 1)
10 + (–1)
9 ≡ 0(mod 11), so k = 10. Now we get a 2-cycle and 
1 10-cycle. For example I is the identity permutation. (e 1) (2, 9, 10, 7, 5, 11, 4, 3, 6, 
8) like wise we get with each (e 2) (e 3) and … (e 11).  
 
The proof of theorem 4.3.2 is left as an exercise to the reader and the proof involves 
only number theoretic techniques. 
 
We propose some problems for the reader.

PROBLEMS: 
 
1. Find the number of S-representation of the loop L9(3). 
2. How many S-pseudo representation exist for L13(4)?

4.4  Smarandache isotopes of loops 
 
In this section we introduce the concept of Smarandache isotopes in loops. The 
Smarandache isotopes exists only when Ln(m) ∈ Ln are loops of order n + 1 where n 
is a non-prime. We see for a given loop we can have several S-isotope loops. 
Characterize those loops for which S-isotopes are only one.  
 
DEFINITION 4.4.1: Let (L, •) be a loop, we define Smarandache principal 
isotope of a S-subloop A, (A, ∗) of the subloop (A, •) for any predetermined a, b 
∈ A for all x, y ∈ A,  x ∗ y = X • Y where X • a = x and b • Y = y. If L has no S-
subloops only subgroups then we do not get the concept of Smarandache 
principal isotope even if L is a S-loop having subgroups. If L is a S-loop having no 
S-subloops then we define for any subgroup Smarandache pseudo isotopes 
associated with L. In case the loop is a S-loop, having no S-subloop the concept of 
Smarandache pseudo isotope coincides with the principal isotope of the loop. 
 
DEFINITION 4.4.2: Let L be a loop having a S-subloop. L is said to be a 
Smarandache G-loop (S-G-loop) if it is isomorphic to all of its Smarandache 
principal isotopes (S-principal isotopes) on the same S-subloop. Thus we see 
unlike in the case of principal isotopes there are many depending on each of the 
S-subloop. 
 
THEOREM 4.4.1: No loop in the class Ln is a S-G-loop. 
 
Proof: Left for the reader to verify using number theoretic techniques as the reader is 
expected to have a good background of number theory.  
 
This theorem is also left as an exercise for the reader. 
 

 
103 
THEOREM 4.4.2: Let Ln(m) ∈ Ln. Then any S-principal isotope with respect to 
the pair (a, a) (a ∈ A ⊂ Ln(m)), A a S-subloop is commutative if and only if A is 
commutative. 
 
THEOREM 4.4.3: The principal isotope of a commutative S-subloop A can also 
be a strictly non-commutative loop. 
 
Proof: Left as an exercise for the reader using number theoretical methods. 
 
PROBLEMS: 
 
1. Find for the loop L51, a S-subloop A, the S-principal isotope. 
2. Find for the loop L45(8); how many S-principal isotopes exist? 
3. Find for the loop L33(17) a S-subloop, whose S-principal isotope is strictly 
non-commutative. 
4. Find for the loops in the class of loops L33: Loops which have several S-
principal isotopes and a loop which has only one S-principal isotope. 
5. Show L19 has no S-principal isotopes only S-pseudo isotopes. 
 
 
4.5 Smarandache hyperloops   
 
The study of hypergroups was introduced only by De Mario Francisco [18] for the 
group Zn of integers modulo n under addition as x ∗ y = x + y, x + y + q for q ∈ Zn 
and denoted by (Zn, q). He proved that the hypergroups of Zn partitions Zn × Zn. The 
definition of hyperloops has meaning only for loop built using Zn. Thus the new class 
of loops defined in Chapter II alone has the relevance for hyperloops. We proceed on 
to define Smarandache hyperloops, Smarandache hyperloops II, Smarandache A- 
hyperloops and Smarandache A-hyperloops II.  
 
We just recall the definition of hyperloops.  
 
DEFINITION [64]: Let (Ln(m), •) be a loop such that (m, n) = 1 and (m – 1, n) 
= 1 using modulo integers. Let '∗' be a binary operation defined on Ln(m) by the 
following rule:  
 
For all x, y ∈ Ln(m), x ∗ y = (x • y, (x • y) • q) where q ∈ Ln(m). Then (Ln(m), ∗, 
q) is a hyperloop. Clearly (Ln(m), ∗, q) is a subset of Ln(m) × Ln(m).  
Example 4.5.1: Let L5(4) = {e, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. The hyperloops of (L5(4), •) is given 
by  
(L5(4), ∗, 5) = {(e, 5), (1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (4, 3), (5, e)} 
(L5(4), ∗, 4) = {(e, 4), (1, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, e), (5, 1)} 
(L5(4), ∗, 3) = {(e, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, e), (4, 5), (5, 2)} 

 
104 
(L5(4), ∗, 2) = {(e, 2), (1, 5), (2, e), (3, 4), (4, 1), (5, 3)} 
(L5(4), ∗, 1) = {(e, 1), (1, e), (2, 3), (3, 5), (4, 2), (5, 4)} 
(L5(4), ∗, e} = {(e, e), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5)} 
 
From this example we see that the hyperloops in general need not be a loop. For the 
simple reason for the hyperloops {L5(4), ∗, n} when n ≠ e is not even closed.  
 
Now one of the natural questions would be, why should one take in the definition. (x 
∗ y) ∗ q we could also take x ∗ (y ∗ q); when we take (x ∗ y) ∗ q instead of x ∗ (y ∗ 
q) the nature of partition is affected. So only in case of hyperloops we define 
hyperloop defined using x ∗ (y ∗ q) as A-hyperloops.  
 
DEFINITION [64]: Let (Ln(m), •) be a loop. Let ∗ be a binary operation defined 
on Ln(m) as x ∗ y = (x ∗ y, x ∗ (y ∗ q)) for all x, y ∈ Ln(m) and q ∈ Ln(m). Ln(m) 
together with the binary operation ∗ is called the A-hyperloop and is given by 
{(Ln(m), ∗, q)A = (x • y, x • (y • q)/ q ∈Ln(m)}.  
 
The A-hyperloop for the L5(4) is given by the following example:  
 
Example 4.5.2: Let (L5(4), •) be the loop. The A-hyperloops of (L5(4), •) is as 
follows: (L5(4), ∗, 5)A = {(e, 5), (1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (4, 3), (5, 3), (5, e), (4, e), 
(3, 4), (2, 1), (3, e), (1, 3), (5, 1), (4, 2), (5, 4), (2, e), (1, e), (5, 2)}. Similarly 
we get 18 elements in each of the cases (L5(4), ∗, 4)A, …, (L5(4), ∗, 1)A. But in case 
of (L5(4), ∗, e)A = {(e, e), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5)}.  
 
Clearly A-hyperloops and hyperloops behave in a different way on the same loop 
which is evident from these examples. 
 
For more about these loops please refer [64]. 
 
DEFINITION 4.5.1: Let Ln(m) ∈ Ln be a loop. The Smarandache hyperloop (S-
hyperloop) of Ln(m) is (Ln(m), q) is a subset of Ln(m) × Ln(m) and q is an 
element of a S-subloop. A of Ln(m) that is x ∗ y = (x • y, (x • y) • q) note if 
Ln(m) has no S-subloops but is a S-loop then we replace A by Ln(m) in this case 
the Smarandache hyperloop coincides with the hyperloop. 
 
DEFINITION 4.5.2: Let Ln(m) ∈ Ln be a loop (Ln(m), q)is defined as the 
Smarandache hyperloop II if q ∈ A, where A is a S-subloop II. x ∗ y =  (x • y, (x • 
y) • q).  
 

 
105 
Note in both the definitions 4.5.1 and 4.5.2 if we take x • (y • q) instead of (x ∗ y) • 
q we get a different S-hyperloops. Like in definition 4.5.1 if L has no S-subloop II but 
L is a S-loop II then S-hyperloop is defined by replacing A by L. 
 
THEOREM 4.5.1: Let Ln(m) ∈ Ln. If n is a prime then S hyperloop of Ln(m) is the 
same as hyperloop of Ln(m). 
 
Proof: If n is a prime Ln(m) is only a S-loop and Ln(m) has no S-subloops.  
 
DEFINITION 4.5.3: Let Ln(m) ∈ Ln we say the Smarandache A-hyperloop (S-A-
hyperloop) of Ln(m) is defined as { Ln(m), q} where q is in a S-subloop B of L. If 
Ln(m) has no S-subloop then we replace B by L provided L is a S-loop and we say 
in this case the A-hyperloop and the S-A-hyperloop coincide. (Ln(m), q , ∗) = {x • 
y, x •(y • q) | q ∈ B}. 
 
DEFINITION 4.5.4: Let Ln(m) ∈ Ln. The Smarandache A-hyperloop II (S-A-
hyperloop II) is the set (Ln(m), q, ∗) = {x • y, x •(y • q) | q ∈ B where B is a S-
subloop II} If Ln(m) has no S-subloop II but is a S-loop II then we replace B by 
Ln(m).  
 
Now we will illustrate by 2 examples one for each.  
 
Example 4.5.3: Let L45(8) ∈ L45, A =  {e, 1, 6, 11,16, 21, 26, 31, 36, 41} is a 
subloop of L45(8) which is a S-loop. The S-hyperloop with respect to A. Find (L45(8), 
∗, q) = {x • y, x •(y • q) | q ∈ A} It is only simple calculation to find the S-A-
hyperloop of A. Find (L45(8), ∗, q) = {x • y, x •(y • q) | q ∈ A}. Compare them.

This is a loop of order 10 commutative and is a S-loop. The S-subloop of L9(5) is A = 
{e, 2, 5, 8} as {e, 2} is a subgroup of L9(5). S-hyperloop {L9(3), ∗, e} = {(e,e),(1,1),

(2, 2), … , (9, 9)}.  {L9(3), ∗, 2}, {L9(3),∗, 5} and {L9(3), ∗, 8} can be calculated 
and test whether the S-hyperloops partition L9(5) × L9(5); on similar lines one can 
find S-A-hyperloop, S-hyperloop II and S-A hyperloop II and compare them and test 
whether they partition or not.

RESEARCH PROBLEMS 
 
 
This chapter proposes open research problems to researchers / students / 
algebraists and above all to those mathematicians who form the growing community 
of researching the Smarandache notions. Since already several researchers are 
working on Smarandache algebraic structures we by writing this book add to the 
attraction of more and more students / researchers to study as this Smarandache

be done otherwise. We list here the fifty two research problems which will be a major
