About the Authors
Nancy W. Hall, M.S., M.Phil., lived the menopause experience in real life as
she wrote this book. In addition to delving into the most up-to-date research
on perimenopause, menopause, women’s health, and treatments for
menopausal symptoms, she relentlessly grilled her friends and a shocking
number of complete strangers about their experiences. 
Nancy received her Master’s degrees in psychology at Yale University. Her
interest in various aspects of parenting led her to research and write about
all sorts of issues pertaining to children’s and women’s health and work-life
concerns. Nancy has been a contributing editor for both Child magazine and
Parents magazine, and a frequent contributor to other parenting, women’s,
and health magazines and Web sites. Her books on child development, family
policy, and health include Balancing Pregnancy and Work: How to Make the
Most of the Next 9 Months on the Job (Rodale, 2004). 
Nancy is the mom of a son and a daughter (both keepers). When she’s not
writing books and magazine articles about these and other topics, she knits,
bakes artisan breads, raises bees, and studies goju ryu karate.
Marcia L. Jones, PhD, has life experience in fertility treatment, perimenopause,
and menopause. In 1991, while attempting to start a family at the age of 38, she
scoured bookstores searching for down-to-earth information on the likely prob-
lems and how to proceed. Her doctor directed her to the only information avail-
able at the time, photocopies of technical articles from medical journals and
pamphlets written by pharmaceutical companies trying to sell product. Today,
many women are delaying childbirth, so the issue of fertility fits nicely into a
discussion of perimenopause and menopause. These experiences served as her
primary motivation for writing this book. She became certain that women in
their mid-thirties to late forties need current, unbiased, reliable information on
perimenopause and menopause written for a layperson.
Thanks to the efforts of her doctor Jane Chihal, MD, a contributor to this
book and a recognized expert on menopause and fertility, Dr. Jones was the
proud mother of two girls ages 6 and 4. 
Dr. Jones received her PhD from Southern Methodist University in anthro-
pology. She led many research expeditions in the Middle East and served 
as an associate professor of anthropology at the University of Tulsa. 
Growing weary of academia, Marcia shifted her career focus and entered the
fast-paced world of software, achieving the rank of chief operating officer and
co-owner of Criterion, a company that developed human-resource software

for Fortune 1000 organizations. She grew Criterion from a $1.5 million com-
pany to a $10 million company and recently sold it to Peopleclick. During the
past 18 years, she has written many articles on people in the workforce and
taught courses in the use of human-resource technology as an adjunct profes-
sor in the Graduate School of Management at the University of Dallas. 
Theresa Eichenwald has extensive experience caring for menopausal women
as an internist at hospitals in New York, Washington D.C., Philadelphia, and,
most recently, Texas. She has taught at Albert Einstein School of Medicine
and Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York. 
In addition to teaching and caring for patients, Dr. Eichenwald has authored a
number of articles for professional journals, covering topics such as breast
cancer and ovarian tumors, as well as patient education pamphlets. She is a
member of the American Medical Association, the American College of
Physicians, and in medical school participated in the American Medical
Student Association Task Force on Aging.

Dedication
To David, through all the ages, and to Wilson and Meg, through all the stages.
Author’s Acknowledgments
My work could not have been accomplished without the solid foundation,
wit, and wisdom of the first edition’s authors, the late Marcia L. Jones, PhD
and Theresa Eichenwald, MD.
Special thanks to Leslie Connor and Sandi Kahn Shelton for always, always
being there for me, and to Leslie, Sandi, and to Judy Theiss and the many
other women with whom I spoke for graciously sharing their time and their
own experiences. Thanks, too, to the hundreds of thousands of women who
unselfishly participate every day in health studies and clinical trials that 
benefit millions of us. It’s not hot in here after all, but it’s nice to know it’s not
just me.
A huge thank you to Marilyn Allen, who put me in the right place at precisely
the right time. 
The terrific Wiley Publishing staff was delightful to work with. Special thanks
to Michael Lewis, who brought me on board and supported my approach to
the book’s second edition. The wonderful support and spot-on advice of my
project editor, Jennifer Connolly, didn’t just make it look easy — with Jenn to
light the way, it really was easy.

Introduction
W
e wrote this book to give women of all ages a clear view of the physi-
cal, mental, and emotional changes related to menopause. For genera-
tions, women of all ages have approached menopause without knowing
specifically what it would mean for them. Oh, you probably knew that
menopause and hot flashes go hand in hand, but even that information isn’t
always true. The truth is that you may never have a hot flash, and if you do, it
will probably be years before you’re menopausal. Common knowledge about
menopause is still too often dominated by myth and misinformation. (The
medical community didn’t even officially recognize the link between estrogen
and hot flashes until 1974!) 
If menopause only concerned a small group of people on a desert island, this
lack of information might be understandable. But over half of the world’s
population will become menopausal one day. Menopause has been the misfit
family member of the research community for years: a collection of symp-
toms and a very real phenomenon, but not a disease. Even medical textbooks
pay scant attention to the topic. Today, one group is paying attention to
menopause. The pharmaceutical industry sees great opportunity in the field
of menopause, and more research is underway. If you’re looking for books to
help reasonably intelligent women navigate the journey of menopause, your
options are still somewhat limited to a choice between pretty, glossy pam-
phlets published by drug companies who may just be a tiny bit biased in
their recommendations, or books that promote the natural aspects of
menopause with such ferocity that you may feel guilty wishing for relief from
troublesome symptoms. If you’re really persistent, you will find some acade-
mic articles in medical journals, but your eyes could glaze over as you try to
pick out straightforward answers to your practical questions. We hope this
book can fill that void. Our goal is to help you digest the research so you can
make objective and informed health decisions based on your own experience
with menopause.
Menopause is not a disease — that’s true. No one is going to die from
menopause or its symptoms, but every day, women die from the medical
effects of low estrogen levels. Your risks of certain diseases and cancers rise
after menopause. Some folks may respond to that statement with one of
their own, “Well, that’s because women are older when they go through
menopause.” True again, but it’s also true that estrogen plays a role in an
amazing number of functions in your body, some of which protect your
organs, increase your immunity, and slow degeneration. This transformation
we call menopause impacts our health in very significant ways. This book
helps you understand the story behind the symptoms and the diseases.

2
Menopause For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
Some women choose to use hormone therapy to relieve symptoms associ-
ated with menopause and protect their body from disease. The choice of
whether to take hormones or not is quite controversial because hormone
therapy has its own significant set of risks. The debate goes on in the medical
community and media concerning the risks of hormone therapy. If you’re like
many women, your confusion only grows as you read more on the subject.
Each new study seems to contradict the findings of the last one. You’re an
intelligent person. But how can you know which study you should believe? In
this book, we try to provide enough information to enable you to make
informed decisions about your health.
About This Book
We have no agenda in writing this book. We’re not trying to sell you medica-
tions, alternative health strategies, or remedies. This book presents accurate
and up-to-date information from the most credible sources. It contains
straightforward information based on reliable medical studies without the
academic lingo common to medical journals. When no clear-cut answers exist
and when quality research shows mixed conclusions, we let you know.
Everyone’s time is limited, so we cut to the chase. We cover the questions
that are important to you during this phase of your life. If you want more
detail, we provide an appendix full of resources to help with your personal
research. We also try not to stray too far from the topic at hand. For example,
during the years leading up to menopause, women may have difficulty getting
pregnant. The same hormonal changes that cause those annoying symptoms
prior to menopause also stifle fertility. Many women in their late 30s who are
trying to get pregnant rely on hormone supplements. Despite the overlap in
hormonal terms, fertility is not a concern for many women going through the
change, so our discussion is limited.
Whether you’re going through the change, have already been there, or are
about to start off down that road, you’ll find the information you need
between these snazzy yellow and black covers. We cover all the health issues
and therapy choices that confront women during the menopausal years.
Foolish Assumptions
Every author has to make a few assumptions about her audience, and we’ve
made a few assumptions about you:

 You’re a woman. (But, believe it or not, your treatment choices can have
implications for the guy in your life, so we’ll talk just a tiny bit about his
health, too.)
 You want to understand what’s going on with your body.
 You’re looking for straight talk for real people as opposed to scientific
jargon and Medicalese (though we have a Medicalese icon to invite you
into short — optional — forays into this territory).
 You want to evaluate your risks of disease as you pass through midlife
and move into your menopausal years.
 You don’t want a book that claims to let you diagnose yourself or figure
out what medications you need. You have a medical advisor to discuss
these things with.
 You want to be able to ask intelligent questions and discuss treatment
alternatives with your healthcare providers.
 You want to feel more confident about the quality of your healthcare.
 You buy every book that has a black and yellow cover.
If any of these statements apply to you, you’re in the right place.
How This Book Is Organized
We’ve organized this book into five parts so you can go directly to the topic
that interests you the most. Here’s a brief overview of each part:
Part I: The Main Facts about Menopause
The journey to menopause often catches women by surprise. You may not
have been expecting to take the journey, or you may have been wondering
when you would begin. In this part, we give you a quick overview of what
your hormones are doing before, during, and after menopause. If you haven’t
thought about things such as hormones and follicles for a while, don’t worry;
we refresh your memory. Your sixth-grade health-and-hygiene course proba-
bly never finished the story. In this part, you get the whole story from how
the egg makes its journey from the ovary to the uterus to what happens when
the ovary goes into retirement. We’ve also added a chapter to answer the spe-
cial questions you may have if you’re among the small group of women who
(through illness, medical treatment, or some other factor) face menopause
more suddenly or much earlier than most women will.

Introduction

Part II: The Effects of Menopause 
on Your Body and Mind
Want to know how hormones affect the health of your body and mind? You
can find the answers in Part II. We devote each chapter in this part to a spe-
cific body part or health issue. In each chapter, you get an overview of how
hormones function in relation to this part of your body and the types of
conditions that can develop, how to recognize them, and what you can do
about them.
Part III: Treating the Effects
You may want to evaluate the pros and cons of hormone therapy (HT) from
time to time during your journey through menopause. This part of the book
brings you up to date on what the medical community knows about HT. We
discuss the effects of HT so that you can make informed decisions. Reading
these chapters provides added benefits as well: You’ll probably find it easier
to evaluate the news about hormone research that comes out in future years.
We also include information about non-HT drugs and alternative treatments.
This will help you make informed decisions on treating menopause symp-
toms and helping to protect your health during the menopausal years with-
out hormones. You may be one of many women for whom hormone therapy
isn’t medically appropriate, or you may just prefer not to take hormones, or
to take them for as short a period as possible.
Part IV: Lifestyle Issues for 
Menopause and Beyond
Part IV is chock full of great ways to stay healthy and enjoy a long and active
life during and after menopause. Staying healthy and active is simpler than
you think. We discuss healthy eating habits and simple ways to stay fit.
Whether you’re looking for natural ways to lower your risk of specific dis-
eases or for ways to slow the aging process, you can find the information you
need right here. We even get into the ways in which this new stage of your life
can be richer and more exciting than any you’ve experienced yet. 
Part V: The Part of Tens
If you’re a fan of For Dummies books, you probably recognize this part. These
are short chapters with quick tips and fast facts. In Part V, we debunk ten
4
Menopause For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

menopause myths, review ten common medical tests you may encounter,
suggest ten terrific exercise programs for menopausal women, and give you
tips about ten powerhouse foods that will help keep you feeling your best —
now and in the years to come.
Part VI: The Appendixes
A glossary of menopause-related terms and a list of menopause-related
resources cap the book.
Conventions Used in This Book
We use our own brand of shorthand for some frequently used terms and
icons to highlight specific information. 
As you read this book, you’ll discover that menopause is a process, with dif-
ferent stages characterized by similar symptoms. These stages are referred
to as perimenopause, the three to ten years prior to menopause when you
may experience symptoms; menopause itself, which you know you’ve reached
only after you’ve reached it because the definition of menopause is the
absence of periods for a year; and postmenopause, which is your life after
you’ve stopped having periods. In this book, we use perimenopause to describe
the premenopause condition, and we use menopause to refer to everything
after that just because the term postmenopause isn’t commonly used.
A major part of this book — the whole of Part III as well as sections in other
chapters — talks about hormone therapy (HT), which is used to alleviate
symptoms and address health concerns prompted by menopause. In litera-
ture and on Web sites, you can see hormone therapies referred to and abbre-
viated any number of ways, including hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
and estrogen replacement therapy (ERT). But we stick pretty closely to using
HT because we feel that it’s the most inclusive and accurate term. Just be
aware that HT means essentially the same thing as HRT.
And, speaking of hormones, a couple of the more important ones for
menopausal women have several subcategories:
 Types of estrogen include estriol, estradiol, and estrone.
 Progesterone is the class of hormone; the form used in hormone ther-
apy is often referred to as progestin.
We sometimes use these terms interchangeably and only refer to the specific
hormone as necessary for clarity.

Introduction

Icons Used in This Book
In this book, we use icons as a quick way to go directly to the information
you need. Look for the icons in the margin that point out specific types of
information. Here’s what the icons we use in this book mean.
The Tip icon points out practical, concise information that can help you take
better care of yourself.
This icon points you to medical terms and jargon that can help you under-
stand what you read or hear from professionals and enable you to ask your
healthcare provider intelligent questions.
This fine piece of art flags information that’s worth noting.
When you see this icon, do what it tells you to do. It accompanies info that
should be discussed with an expert in the field.
The Technical Stuff icon points out material that generally can be classified
as dry as a bone. Although we think that the information is interesting, it’s
not vital to your understanding of the issue. Skip it if you so desire.
This icon cautions you about potential problems or threats to your health.
Where to Go from Here
For Dummies books are designed so that you can dip in anywhere that looks
interesting and get the information you need. This is a reference book, so
don’t feel as though you have to read an entire chapter (or even an entire
section for that matter). You won’t miss anything by skipping around. So, find
what interests you and jump on in!

T
he first act of Dance of the Hormones probably
occurred three decades or so ago for you. Remember
the bittersweet tale of teenage angst and joy that we call
puberty? And now, intermission (the menstrual years)
may be coming to a close as the hormones once again
take the stage for the second act — menopause. Take your
seat and get ready to peruse your program . . .  uh, Part I
of this book.
In Part I, we provide you with an outline to your
menopausal years. We define menopause, review the biol-
ogy, introduce you to the actors —your hormones — and
briefly review the related symptoms and health conditions
(physical, mental, and emotional). There’s even a special
scene with a little extra drama for those of you for whom
the menopause curtain rose early. Get to it before the
usher dims the lights.

 Living a long and healthy life
“You’ve come a long way, baby” seems like a recurring slogan for baby
boomers. The phrase certainly says a lot about the women of this
generation as they approach the rite of passage called menopause. As an
individual, you no doubt feel like you’ve come a long way in your life by the
time you begin to think about menopause. Society in general, and women in
particular, have also come a long way in opening up the discussion about the
mysteries of menopause.
The phrase “you’ve come a long way, baby” closes with “but you’ve got such
a long way to go.” Women today may well live 40 or 50 years after menopause.
We all want to enjoy these years by visiting friends, taking care of our loved
ones and ourselves, and pursuing favorite interests (old and new). In this
chapter, we introduce you to menopause so you know what to expect when
the time comes or what has been happening to you if you’re already in
transition.
Defining Menopause
Puberty and menopause bracket the reproductive season of your life, and
they share many characteristics. They’re both transitions (meaning that they
don’t last forever); they’re both triggered by hormones; they both cause
physical and emotional changes (that sometimes drive you crazy); and they
both close some doors and enrich your life by opening new ones. 

Puberty was the time when your hormones first swung into action. It marked
the beginning of your reproductive years. Remember the ride? Your hormone
levels shifted wildly when you got your first menstrual period. Your emotions
probably went a little haywire for a while, too. Over the course of a few years,
your hormones found a comfortable level. Your unpredictable periods finally
settled into a predictable pattern, and your emotional balance was more or
less restored. 
At the end of your reproductive years, your hormone levels go through a sim-
ilar dance (this time causing the midlife mood swings), but your hormones
eventually find a new, lower level of production. Your periods are erratic for a
while, but they eventually wind down and stop. So do those emotional roller
coaster rides. Unfortunately, this time can be just as confusing as when you
experienced puberty — fortunately, we use this section to unravel the basic
mystery for you.
Getting the terminology right
Have you ever noticed how you don’t really pay close attention to directions
or where you’re going when you’re the passenger in a car? You only start to
worry about every exit number and stop light when you’re the one behind
the wheel. Well, menopause is like that. You hear about menopause and
menopausal symptoms, but you rarely pay much attention to the particulars
until it’s your turn.
When you do slide into the driver’s seat and start paying attention, you may
become frustrated by the confusing terminology associated with the whole
menopause thing. Aside from the pamphlets you get from the doctor’s office,
most books, magazines, and articles treat menopause like a stage that starts
with hot flashes and goes on for the rest of your life. But we know better. The
following list gives you the lowdown on the terms associated with
menopause:
 Menopause: Menopause actually means the end of menstruation. During
the years leading up to menopause (called perimenopause), your periods
may be so erratic that you’re never sure which period will be the last
one, but you aren’t officially menopausal until you haven’t had a period
for a year. 
 Perimenopause: The term perimenopause refers to the time leading up
to the cessation of menstruation, when estrogen production is slowing
down. A lot of the symptoms that folks usually label as menopausal (hot
flashes, mood swings, sleeplessness, and so on) actually take place
during the perimenopausal years. We’re sticklers in this book about
using the term perimenopause rather than menopause to describe this
10
Part I: The Main Facts about Menopause 

early phase because you’re still having periods. We also use peri-
menopause because we want to note the physiological and emotional
changes you experience prior to the end of your periods and distinguish
them from the changes that happen after your body has adjusted to
lower levels of estrogen.
 Postmenopause: Technically, the time after your last period is called
postmenopause, but this word has never really caught on. So, in keeping
with common usage, we most often use the term menopause to refer to
the actual event and the years after menopause and use postmenopause
only when it helps clarify things. When we talk about menopausal
women in this book, we’re talking about women who have stopped
having periods — whether they’re 55 or 75.
The years leading up to and following menopause mark a pretty major trans-
formation in a woman’s life. As you make your way through this period of
your life, you’ll want to know where you’re at within the whole grand scope of
the change and what’s going on inside you. Here’s a brief description of the
phases associated with menopause. (Don’t worry: We give you a lot more
detail about the various stages in Chapters 2 and 4.)
Approaching the change: Perimenopause
Perimenopause is the stage during which your hormones start to shift gears.
Some months, your hormones operate at the levels they’ve worked at for the
past 30 years or so; other months, your aging ovaries don’t produce estrogen
when they should. Your brain responds to this lack of estrogen production by
sending a signal to try to get those ovaries jumpstarted. When they receive
the signal, your aging ovaries overcompensate but don’t produce estrogen in
the same quantities that they used to.
Your period is late because your ovaries produced less estrogen during the
first part of your normal cycle, or because you may never have ovulated,
making the entire cycle weird and unusual — sometimes heavy, sometimes
light.
So, during perimenopause, you still have your period, but you experience
symptoms that folks associate with menopause. If you go to the doctor at this
stage and ask, “What’s happening to me? Could this be menopause?” the
doctor will often go straight to the “Could this be menopause?” part of your
question. Of course you’re not menopausal if you’re still having periods. But
the problem is that many doctors miss the first part of the question — the
“What’s happening to me?” part. This is the real issue you want to get to the
bottom of — the cause of your weird physical and emotional conditions.
11
Chapter 1: Mapping Out Menopause

Menstruating no more: Menopause 
Menopause means never having to say, “Can I borrow a tampon?” again.
If you haven’t had a period for a year, you’ve reached menopause. Women can
become menopausal approximately anytime between the ages of 45 and 55,
with the average age being 51. The definition may seem cut and dry at first
glance, but here are a few situations that may leave you scratching your head.
What if you use a cyclical type of hormone therapy in which you take estro-
gen for several days and progestin during the last few days of your cycle? You
still have a period (the progestin causes you to slough the lining of the
uterus), but you don’t ovulate. Are you menopausal or not? Technically,
you’re delaying your last period. You’re taking a sufficient dosage of estrogen
to rid yourself of perimenopausal symptoms, but you’re no longer fertile.
Here’s another tricky one: If you’ve had a hysterectomy (surgical removal of
the uterus), you’re considered to be “surgically menopausal.” But, if you had
your uterus removed but kept your ovaries, you’re not “hormonally”
menopausal because your ovaries still produce estrogen. By taking your
blood and analyzing your hormone levels, your physician can tell you
whether your hormones are officially at menopausal levels.
These tricky situations cause us to ask, “Who cares about the definition?”
You know a rose is a rose. The main concern here is what’s happening with
your hormones, especially estrogen. Hormonal changes can trigger many
physical and emotional health issues.
When you reach menopause, your hormone production is so low that your
periods stop. Your ovaries still produce some estrogen and testosterone, but
instead of producing hormones in cycles (which is why you have periods and
why you’re only fertile for about four or five days each month), your body
now produces constant, low levels of hormones. The type of estrogen your
ovaries churn out also switches from an active type to a rather inactive form.
Getting past menopause: Postmenopause
Postmenopause is the period of your life that starts after menopause (a year
after your last period) and ends when you do. This is a time when your body
is living on greatly reduced levels of estrogen, testosterone, and progesterone.
In this book, we simply refer to both the cessation of your period and your
life afterward as menopause.
12
Part I: The Main Facts about Menopause 

Anticipating Menopause
When will you become menopausal? The timing varies from woman to
woman. Predicting this stuff is nowhere near an exact science. Heck, you
can’t even use the fact that you started your period earlier than most women
as a predictor that you’ll stop menstruating earlier. (The same goes for start-
ing your period later in life and ending it later in life.) Genetics and lifestyle
may have some impact on the schedule, but basically, it happens when it
happens. But we can give you some ballpark age ranges for these phases.
Most women become perimenopausal sometime between the ages of 35 and
50. You’ll probably know it when you get there because you’ll probably have
some of the symptoms (check out the Cheat Sheet at the front of this book
and Chapter 4) and/or some irregular periods. Women usually become
menopausal sometime in their 50s.
Some events can alter these “normal” age patterns, including lifestyle habits
and medical interventions. Here are a few exceptional types of menopause:
 Premature menopause: A term used when women go through
menopause in their 30s. This timing is considered unusually early, but it
may be normal for you.
 Medical menopause: Refers to menopause induced by chemotherapy,
radiation, anorexia, or other factors. This type of menopause is some-
times reversible, though your periods may take a month, several
months, or even years to return.
 Surgical menopause: Refers to menopause induced by surgery. Removal
of both ovaries results in immediate, nonreversible menopause.
Because your ovaries produce all types of sex hormones (estrogen,
progesterone, and testosterone), surgical removal of your ovaries is fairly
traumatic for your system: you’ll go straight into intense menopausal
symptoms such as hot flashes. (Chapter 3 is devoted to preparing for
and understanding the causes and consequences of premature
menopause.)
Transitioning to Menopause
When a group of women talk about their personal experiences of puberty,
menstrual cycles, and pregnancy, the stories are all over the board. Some
women don’t notice changes in their bodies; others recognize the moment
ovulation or conception occurs. Some women have terrible problems with
13
Chapter 1: Mapping Out Menopause

premenstrual syndrome (PMS); others have trouble-free cycles throughout
their entire lives. Women’s experiences vary with perimenopause and
menopause just as much as they vary with these other changes. In this sec-
tion we cover what you might experience as you begin the transition into 
perimenopause.
Starting out
Most women’s ovaries begin a transformation sometime between the ages of
35 and 50. If your periods end before you reach 40, you experience what’s
known as premature menopause.
Perimenopause is sometimes called a climacteric period, which simply means
that it’s a crucial period. Remember that your ovaries don’t just shut down
one day; the transition is punctuated with production peaks and valleys that
cause many annoying physical and mental symptoms. Perimenopause is a
time of important physiological change — when egg production along with
the production of estrogen and progesterone begins slowing down.
Identifying symptoms
We devote Chapter 4 almost exclusively to the symptoms women may experi-
ence during perimenopause. Several other chapters explain the link between
your hormones and these symptoms.
Less than half of all women experience annoying symptoms such as hot
flashes, heart palpitations, interrupted sleep, and mood swings during the
transitional period prior to menopause. Most women who do experience
these symptoms experience the symptoms while they’re still menstruating on
a regular schedule.
Other women recognize that they’re perimenopausal because their periods,
which used to be as regular as clockwork, are now irregular. Their periods
may be late, they may skip a period, or their flow may be light one month and
resemble a flood the next month.
Unfortunately, no objective medical test exists to determine whether you’re
officially perimenopausal.

Part I: The Main Facts about Menopause 

Calling in the professionals
If you’re in your late 40s or 50s and you’re experiencing the symptoms listed
on the Cheat Sheet and in Chapter 3, you can probably assume that you’re
perimenopausal. But don’t cancel that appointment with your medical advi-
sor to get the symptoms checked out. (If you don’t have an appointment to
cancel, make one and keep it.) Many symptoms of perimenopause are the
same as some of the symptoms of thyroid problems, cardiovascular disease,
depression, and other serious health issues.
Your medical practitioner can help you deal with the undesirable symptoms
of perimenopause and prevent serious health conditions that are more preva-
lent after menopause.
Seeing it through to the end
Because you never really know when perimenopause starts, accurately defin-
ing a timeframe is difficult. Some women experience symptoms for ten years
before their periods stop. The fact is that most of the symptoms you hear
about are caused by the fluctuating hormone levels of perimenopause as
opposed to the sustained, low levels of hormones you experience during
menopause.
You’re officially menopausal one year after your last period. After that, many
people use the term postmenopause to mark the rest of your life (though in
this book, we just keep using menopause).
Treating Menopause
At the end of the perimenopause road, your ovaries (and consequently, your
hormone production) finally wind down. Your body gradually adjusts to the
lower hormone levels typical of life after menopause. Most of the peri-
menopausal symptoms disappear, but now your concerns shift to health
issues associated with prolonged, lowered levels of active estrogen.
Estrogen not only plays a role in reproduction, it also helps regulate a host
of other functions throughout your body. Estrogen protects your bones and
cardiovascular system, among other responsibilities. Those pesky peri-
menopausal symptoms may make life miserable, but they aren’t dangerous to
your health. But the conditions associated with long periods of diminished
estrogen levels are very troublesome. They include
15
Chapter 1: Mapping Out Menopause

 Cardiovascular disease
 Heart disease
 Hypertension (high blood pressure)
 Osteoporosis
 Stroke
So you and your doctor need to work on strategies to prevent these
conditions.
Some women choose hormone therapy (HT) to help prevent disease; others
choose to take medications as individual problems arise. (We cover hormone
therapy in Chapters 11 through 16 and alternative and non-hormonal ways to
deal with certain conditions in Chapter 17.) Whichever path or paths you
choose, each strategy presents benefits and risks. Your choices depend on
your medical history, your family history, and your healthcare preferences.
And remember that both your experiences and medical technologies change
daily, so re-evaluate your options from time to time.
Promoting Longevity
Not long ago, 50 was about as old as we could expect to get. Today, many of
us will live well into our 70s, 80s, and 90s. The fact that most women stop
being fertile in their 40s doesn’t mean that women are no longer productive
after 40. In fact, with the whole reproduction thing out of the way, women
have more time and opportunities to make new contributions to life on earth
(or in space).
One of the keys to a long and happy life is good genes. Another key is taking
good care of yourself and the genes you’re dealt. Regular checkups can
address medical issues as they arise and help prevent others. Eat healthy
foods (and portions), get some exercise, and live life to its fullest.
Everyone agrees that a healthy lifestyle is the best way to reduce trouble-
some perimenopausal symptoms, prevent disease, and promote a long and
healthy life. It’s also the least risky strategy for dealing with perimenopause
and menopause. Taking up this challenge requires self-assessment and a bit
of determination. Shifting to a healthy lifestyle involves eliminating unhealthy
habits, getting at least a half-hour of aerobic exercise five times a week, and
maintaining a healthy, balanced diet that includes at least five servings of
fruit and vegetables each week. We provide some great info on diet, nutrition,
and exercise in Chapters 18 and 19. In Chapter 20, we talk about how the part
of your life that follows menopause can be one of the most rewarding of all.

I
f you’re in your 40s, and you’re like a lot of women, you’ve asked yourself,
“What in the world is happening to me?” Maybe extra girth seemingly
appeared overnight and now won’t go away no matter how many crunches
you do. Or maybe you notice yourself perspiring while lying in bed next to
your partner just as you did when you first got together — except now it hap-
pens in the middle of the night when you’re not even thinking about that.
Does it seem as if the world has gotten dumber and that no one can do things
right anymore? Maybe your irritability and mood swings aren’t caused by the
planets being out of alignment; maybe it’s perimenopause.
In this chapter, we take a look at how your hormones work during your repro-
ductive years and how they change as you approach and enter your nonre-
productive years. Fluctuations or deviations in your hormone levels largely
trigger the physiological, emotional, and mental changes you may notice
during perimenopause and menopause. Getting on a first name basis with
these hormones and learning about their functions won’t necessarily let you
control the havoc they seem to be wreaking. Knowing that your experience is
normal, though, can relieve a lot of worry and uncertainty. 

Setting the Stage
Before we get started, we need to set the stage. Menopause is not a disease,
deficiency, or failure. Nor is it necessarily going to be problematic for you —
every woman’s menopause is different. Menopause is a natural and neces-
sary change in life. Just as infancy, toddlerhood, adolescence, and young
adulthood had their challenges and their rewards, so will your menopausal
years. Only this time around, you have the maturity, sophistication, and
resources to learn about and deal with what’s going on. 
You may see and hear medical terms such as estrogen deficiency, ovarian fail-
ure, and vaginal atrophy used to describe menopause and its symptoms. You
might even come across them in this book. These terms aren’t meant to carry
negative connotations. They’re meant to describe expected conditions.
Viewing menopause as a natural change — not an organ failure — is an
important first step to understanding what might be in store for you and how
best to deal with any symptoms you experience.
Just as women aren’t put on earth for the simple purpose of bearing children,
your ovaries aren’t there just to supply eggs. Your ovaries live a double life —
one as the holder of the seeds of life (oocytes that later develop into eggs),
and the other as a maintenance worker. Your ovaries are a critical source of
hormones for your whole body. After menopause your ovaries don’t retire,
they just change careers. No longer busy with developing follicles that carry
eggs (which release lots of estrogen), the ovaries continue to produce hor-
mones (though in much smaller amounts than before) to help maintain over-
all body functions. 
Because the average life expectancy for people in the United States is about
80 years, the average woman spends a little more than half her life menstruat-
ing and being fertile. And while we live in a culture that puts a lot of emphasis
on these years, the years following menopause can be — and should be —
just as exciting and fruitful. It’s likely that you can expect to spend a signifi-
cant portion of your life just being a woman.
In some circles, the administration of hormone therapy (HT) has long had the
reputation of being a part of the fix-a-failure approach to menopause. But
although we know that HT can help control symptoms such as hot flashes
and vaginal dryness, it’s no longer being routinely recommended for the pre-
vention of health issues such as heart disease and breast cancer. The more
you know about your own body, about how natural hormones (the ones you
make yourself) work, and about how replacement hormones (hormone ther-
apy) work, the better prepared you’ll be to make healthcare decisions tai-
lored just for you.

Part I: The Main Facts about Menopause 

Making the Menstrual Cycle 
and Hormone Connection
Okay, admit it. You didn’t find those long, boring, sterile movies that
explained menstruation to you and your sixth-grade classmates very helpful.
You know the ones — the health-class movies with titles such as “You’re a
Woman Now.” (Back in those days, we didn’t have interesting titles such as
Sex For Dummies.) If you were anything like us, you had difficulty making the
connection between the two-dimensional, cartoon-like illustrations of female
organs and the three-dimensional, high-definition experiences of bloating
and cramps.
In this section, we make the connection between your sex hormones and
your menstrual cycle — hopefully more clearly and meaningfully than those
old movies did.
One of the major functions of sex hormones is to prepare the body to pro-
duce life. So visiting your sex hormones at the reproduction office to watch
them do their jobs as a team is a good place to start the discussion. Then we
take a closer look at each individual member of Team Hormone.
The average menstrual cycle is 28 days, but a cycle that lasts anywhere from
22 to 35 days is perfectly normal. For the purpose of this discussion, we use a
28-day cycle; you can adjust the numbers as necessary to fit your personal
calendar. Figure 2-1 shows hormone levels throughout a menstrual cycle.

Chapter 2: Talking Biology and Psychology

Day 1 of your cycle is the first day of your period (see the “Days of our lives:
Determining Day 1” sidebar to find out how to determine the first day of your
period). Your body begins flushing out the lining of your uterus, which isn’t
needed because a fertilized egg requiring nourishment and support isn’t pre-
sent in your uterus.
Your ovaries are filled with little seeds (eggs) surrounded by support cells
(stroma). During the first half of your cycle (Days 1 to 14), hormones pro-
duced in your brain — follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hor-
mone (LH) — and hormones produced in your ovaries — estrogen — work
together to develop and then release an egg. (For more information on FSH
and LH see the “Linking your brain and body” section later in this chapter.)
During these first two weeks, your estradiol (estrogen) levels are on the rise,
and your progesterone levels are very low. This particular hormone combina-
tion (high estrogen, low progesterone) is why you usually feel so good during
this stretch of your cycle. You owe your energy, restful sleep, upbeat mood,
sharp memory, and terrific concentration to your old friend, estrogen, which
plays a role in many physical and mental systems — not just your reproduc-
tive system.
As soon as the brain senses that estrogen levels are right, it produces a surge
of luteinizing hormone (LH), which triggers the release of an egg — otherwise
known as ovulation. Ovulation usually occurs between Day 12 and Day 16 of
your cycle. (You want the scoop on LH? Check out the “Linking your brain
and body” section later in this chapter.)
After you’ve ovulated, estrogen levels drop, and progesterone production
kicks in. Progesterone, which peaks around Day 20, is a hormone that gets the
uterus ready for a baby. If the egg is fertilized, your progesterone levels stay

Days of our lives: Determining Day 1
The first day of your period is called Day 1.
Simple enough, huh? Sounds pretty definitive.
Well, maybe not. When it comes to your body,
nothing is ever truly definitive. Here’s how
things can get a bit more complicated: Do you
count yesterday as Day 1 because you had
some light bleeding? Or do you call today Day 1
because you really started flowing today? Or
maybe you should count two days ago as Day 1
because you started cramping really badly and
had a bit of spotting.
How to solve this dilemma? Consistency is key.
If you normally have a light day before you start
your regular flow, count your light day as Day 1.
But, if you’re like some women who experience
spotting several days before they actually begin
their period, Day 1 should be the first day of your
regular flow.

high. If the egg isn’t fertilized, progesterone and estrogen levels drop and
menstruation occurs.

hormones do (or what their various nicknames stand for). So we’ve included

Progesterone
Ovaries
Prepares the womb for pregnancy and
helps maintain pregnancy. Although
estrogen is the dominant hormone in the
first half of your menstrual cycle, proges-
terone is dominant in the second half.
The effects of progesterone also include
water retention, sweet cravings, and
fatigue. High doses can work as a seda-
tive or as a depressant. The synthetic
form of progesterone is called progestin.
Testosterone
Ovaries
Considered a “male hormone” even
though the bodies of both men and
women produce it. In women, the ovaries
produce it. During the change, testos-
terone levels drop. Testosterone benefits
women by maintaining healthy libido,
strong bones, and muscle growth.
Quick! What’s a hormone, anyway? Most of us toss this mysterious word
around pretty casually in our everyday lives, and we really use it a lot in this
book, but what does it really mean? Hormones are complex chemicals that
control the release or activity of other chemicals. The network in your body
that controls and regulates these chemicals is called the endocrine system.
Linking your brain and body
Your brain produces the hormones that direct the production of sex hor-
mones in your ovaries. You may say that the hormones produced by your
brain act as senior management, directing operations in your ovaries. The
hormones in your ovaries are the field managers, directing operations in the
field, which is your entire body. The hormones produced by your brain
include
 Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH): When the brain senses that estro-
gen and progesterone levels have dropped, it shoots out some FSH to
the ovaries to tell them to begin developing follicles (nutritious sacs that
cover the eggs) and start producing estrogen.
 Luteinizing hormone (LH): This hormone triggers ovulation. When LH
surges, the follicle releases the egg. The abandoned follicle wrapping,
the corpus luteum, secretes progesterone and estrogen.
22
Part I: The Main Facts about Menopause 

Explaining estrogen
Oh how very sophisticated women are. We don’t just produce estrogen; we
produce three different types of estrogen:
 Estrone (E1): Inactive estrogen predominant after menopause
 Estradiol (E2): Active estrogen
 Estriol (E3): Estrogen produced only during pregnancy
Medical folks use a shorthand system when referring to different types of
estrogen to avoid confusion (and lengthy sentences). 
Throughout the book, we use the generic term estrogen to mean all the differ-
ent types of estrogen, unless distinguishing among them is important for the
discussion at hand.
Estrone (E1)
After menopause, estrone is the predominant type of estrogen streaming
through your body. Before menopause your ovaries make estrone. After
menopause your body fat takes over the job of making estrone. The more
body fat you have, the more estrone you have. Estrone is mainly a stored
form of estrogen. Prior to menopause, your ovaries can convert estrone to
the active form of estrogen, estradiol. That conversion only happens in pre-
menopausal ovaries.
Estradiol (E2)
You may hear doctors or nurses refer to estradiol by its scientific name, 17-
beta estradiol, but most folks know it as “the good stuff.” Before menopause,
estradiol is the predominant form of estrogen produced by your ovaries and
used throughout your body. Estradiol actively helps out with hundreds of

Chapter 2: Talking Biology and Psychology
Putting the “men” back in menopause
Do men go through menopause? Well, techni-
cally, no. But men do experience a drop in
testosterone levels in their 40s. The question of
whether this represents an experience that
might be called male menopause still divides
doctors and researchers. On the other hand, the
terms “andropause” and “viropause” do refer
to a hypothetical male syndrome said to be
characterized by weight gain, irritability, fatigue,
mood swings, loss of libido, decrease in bone
density, and other, remarkably familiar symp-
toms. The jury’s still out on whether your guy is
going through the same thing you are — after
all, these symptoms can all have other causes.
But you might want to save him a little sympa-
thy, just in case.

different physical and mental functions, including maintaining bone density
and giving your brain feedback about levels of the sex hormones. After
menopause, your ovaries stop producing estradiol, and that’s when you
develop many of those annoying symptoms such as hot flashes, palpitations,
changes in your skin, bone, hair, and blood vessels, headaches, and so on.
Your body can convert estrone to estradiol but only with fully functioning
ovaries. Your ovaries are slowing down during perimenopause and
menopause, and your body doesn’t get nearly as much estradiol after
menopause as it used to during your reproductive years.
Estriol (E3)
The weakest of the three estrogens is estriol, which your placenta produces
only if you’re pregnant. If you don’t have any estriol in your body, it’s okay; it
just means you aren’t pregnant.
Promoting progesterone
If all these hormone names are confusing to you, here’s a tip that can help
you make sense of progesterone. Think of progesterone as promoting gesta-
tion; it prepares your womb to nurture a fertilized egg.
Most of your progesterone is made after ovulation. If your egg is fertilized,
the placenta takes over progesterone production during the eighth or ninth
week of pregnancy. If the egg isn’t fertilized, progesterone levels drop. This
lack of progesterone triggers your period. Many doctors believe that symp-
toms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) can be attributed to progesterone.
You can thank progesterone when you crave sweets, feel fatigued, retain
water, and develop acne.
Progesterone gets your body ready to support a pregnancy. How does this
play out? When progesterone levels are high, you feel hungry more often.
Progesterone also slows down the digestion process so that you can absorb
nutrients better, but that slower digestion process can make you feel bloated
or constipated.
Progesterone can cause depression and increase your cholesterol levels.
Progesterone also has a sedating effect that makes some women feel calm
and others feel lethargic. It’s all a matter of perception, but it isn’t your imagi-
nation. Progesterone has been found to be eight times more potent than one
of the drugs used in anesthesia!
24
Part I: The Main Facts about Menopause 

Investigating androgens
Yes, Virginia, your body does produce “male” hormones, and it’s perfectly
normal. Both men and (to a lesser degree) women produce a group of hor-
mones called androgens in their adrenal glands and sex organs (testes in
men, ovaries in women). The androgens affected by menopause are testos-
terone and DHEA (we discuss these two hormones later in this section).
As you age, your body slows its production of both female and male hor-
mones. During the transition of menopause, estrogen and androgen levels
can get a bit out of balance. Even though your androgen levels typically
decrease as estrogen levels decrease, the big decrease in estrogen levels can
alter the balance so that androgen has a greater relative presence than it did
before menopause. This imbalance leads to changes:
 Fat migrates toward your waist.
 Hair thins on your head and starts growing on your chin or upper lip.
 Blood pressure rises.
 Total cholesterol rises.
Okay, okay. Stop cursing your androgens already. They have many positive
effects on women’s bodies too. Check it out:
 Testosterone: This hormone triggers sexual desire. That’s right —
testosterone promotes a healthy sexual desire in women. Testosterone
also helps women build bone, maintain muscle mass (so you burn fat),
and maintain optimal energy levels.
 DHEA: First an introduction is in order. DHEA stands for dehy-
droepiandrosterone (that’s why we use the abbreviation). DHEA is a
building block for testosterone. Your ovaries covert the DHEA from your
adrenal glands into testosterone. Without DHEA you could forget about
all those positives associated with testosterone.
25
Chapter 2: Talking Biology and Psychology
Looking at DHEA regulation 
A technical loophole and special pleading by
two U.S. senators kept DHEA from being regu-
lated by the Food and Drug Administration
under the Anabolic Steroids Act of 2004. Even
so, widespread concern exists about DHEA.
Because it has been used by athletes in doping
(secret use of hormones to promote athletic
performance), the use of DHEA has been
banned by a number of athletic associations,
including the International Olympic Committee,
the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the
National Football League, and the National
Basketball Association.

Some news reports have called DHEA “the fountain of youth” and “the
mother of all hormones,” but so far there’s been no real proof that using this
powerful steroid hormone as a supplement to relieve the symptoms of
menopause is either useful or safe. Although DHEA is widely marketed as an
anti-aging supplement, women who take DHEA may experience side effects
that include facial hair growth, fatigue, headaches, and deepening of their
voices. We still don’t know whether DHEA use is linked to an increase in
breast cancer risk. Because DHEA is unregulated, you may not know how
much you need or how much you’re getting. The bottom line? Never take
DHEA without the approval and close supervision of your healthcare
provider (see “Looking at DHEA regulation”).
Understanding the Stages of Menopause
Menopause, the permanent pause in your periods (menses), is one of those
things that you aren’t sure has happened until long after it’s over. Like the
first time you met your best friend: You probably had no idea that you’d
become so close. You only realized how special that occasion really was
when you were able to look back on it. Okay, maybe menopause isn’t a warm-
and-fuzzy-greeting-card occasion, but it is a passage worth noting.
Are you or aren’t you menopausal? You can answer that question only after
the fact — after you’ve gone a year without your period. Many of the annoy-
ing symptoms assigned to menopause actually are much worse prior to
menopause in the phase known as perimenopause. During perimenopause,
you get both the annoying symptoms (hot flashes, irritability, mood swings,
and so on) and your period. Lucky you.
In this section, we clarify what’s happening to your body during the various
stages of menopause and tell you how to recognize where you are in the great
transition.
Previewing perimenopause
For many women, perimenopause is a big case of déjà vu. Remember puberty
(vaguely)? Remember the crying jags, the mood swings, and the “what’s
wrong with my skin!” traumas? Well, guess what? They’re b-a-a-a-ck. Once
again your hormones are ready to wreak havoc on your body, your emotions,
and your mental faculties. This time around, however, you’re a bit wiser (you
bought this book, didn’t you?), you have experience dealing with change, and
you realize that this too shall pass.
Some doctors advise women who are still experiencing periods not to worry
about “menopausal” symptoms. But you know (because you read it here)
26
Part I: The Main Facts about Menopause 

that the symptoms folks often attribute to menopause are usually felt as
intensely or more intensely during perimenopause. And perimenopause can
last for ten years before a woman stops menstruating altogether and
becomes truly menopausal.
Your mileage may vary! We’ve seen lists that contain dozens of perimenopausal
symptoms. Some women breeze through menopause, others have a tougher
time. Don’t assume that just because your mother, your sister, your best girl-
friend, or the new gal on the Internet menopause message board you’ve been
surfing describes a severe or unusual symptom that you will experience it, too.
Experiencing periodic periods
During perimenopause, things change. If you welcomed your period on the
same day as the full moon for 20 years, you may wake up to find the planets
suddenly out of alignment.
The hormonal shift is due to changes happening in your ovaries. Your ovaries
hold little oocytes (seeds), and each month, some of these seeds develop into
follicles (little sacs that hold an egg). One or two lucky follicles mature and
release an egg. That’s when you ovulate. The oocytes in your ovaries are held
together by a substance called stroma. The stroma produces testosterone,
and the follicles produce estrogen. When you’re very young, you have hun-
dreds of thousands of these little seeds. As you age, you have fewer seeds
and more stroma. As the mix of seeds and stroma in your ovaries changes, so
does hormone production. Your ovaries decrease their production of estro-
gen but continue to produce testosterone.
Sometimes you ovulate during your cycle; sometimes you don’t. Sometimes
the FSH just doesn’t get the follicles producing estrogen right off the bat.
Estrogen levels are low at the beginning of your cycle when they should be
high. Your brain responds to this lack of get-up-and-go by sending another
surge of FSH (see the “Linking your brain and body” section earlier in this
chapter). Finally getting the message, your ovaries become a little frantic and
go into double-time production of estrogen. Right at the time when you
should be ovulating and producing progesterone, your ovaries are just kick-
ing into gear developing a follicle. That means you won’t ovulate when you
usually do and your period will be late.
Your menstrual cycle is all messed up. Your estrogen shoots up, and then it
drops down. You get hot flashes and maybe even heart palpitations (a racing
heart) when estrogen plunges. But just when you’re convinced that some-
thing is seriously wrong and you need to schedule a doctor’s appointment,
you get your period and everything returns to normal. You wonder why you
were so worried and cancel the appointment (if you made one) until the next
weird thing happens.
This is all perfectly fine (maybe not with you, but with Mother Nature) — it’s
all part of perimenopause.
27
Chapter 2: Talking Biology and Psychology

Getting emotional
For some women, it’s not the disrupted sleep, hot flashes, or palpitations that
get their attention — it’s the mood swings. And thank goodness for loved
ones who are right there to let us know just how irritable and unpleasant
we’ve been. Welcome to perimenopause.
Managing mental miscues
You’re already familiar with the roles hormones play in your mental agility
and emotional stability because you’ve dealt with menstrual cycles and, in
some cases, pregnancy. When estrogen levels drop and progesterone levels
rise before your period, you might get those annoying PMS symptoms such
as fuzzy thinking, mood swings, fatigue, and restless sleep.
As hormone levels jump around during perimenopause, these bothersome
symptoms may become more commonplace. Estrogen plays a role in manag-
ing a number of brain operations, and when estrogen levels take a dive
during perimenopause, it’s like guiding a boat that periodically loses its
rudder. Here are some of the mental functions that estrogen helps manage
(and some of the symptoms you may experience when estrogen takes a dive):
 Serotonin production. (Serotonin regulates sleep, pain, libido, mood,
and other mental functions. Less estrogen can mean problems in all
these areas.)
 Body-temperature control. (You experience hot flashes and night sweats.)
 Pain threshold. (You’re more sensitive or intolerant to pain.)
 Attention, mental focus, and concentration abilities. (You have mental
lapses.)
 Communication between nerve cells related to memory. (You become
forgetful.)
Your perimenopause may be longer or shorter than those of your friends.
The average length of perimenopause — from the start of symptoms until the
one-year anniversary of your last period — is about four years. But it’s not
abnormal for perimenopause to last only a couple of years, or for as many as
ten or more years. 
Meeting menopause
The onset of menopause, by definition, takes place a year after your last
period. Very few medical conditions use an anniversary date as a basis for
diagnosis, but lucky us, menopause is one. That’s why figuring out who’s in
the club and who’s not is so hard. After menopause, you’re technically
28
Part I: The Main Facts about Menopause 

postmenopausal (for the rest of your life). The term postmenopausal hasn’t
really caught on in common usage (maybe because it’s such a mouthful). So
we generally use the term menopause to refer both to menopause and the
postmenopausal years.
As far as your body is concerned, reaching menopause is almost a nonevent.
Your ovaries have been slowing down for several years, producing lower and
lower levels of estrogen and only releasing eggs sporadically. Stopping your
periods is a logical outcome of all these changes.
Most of the symptoms ascribed to menopause generally begin during peri-
menopause. But back-to-back (to back) years of lower estrogen-production
levels can result in health issues that you don’t notice until menopause
proper has set in. Over time, lower levels of estrogen (estradiol in particular)
contribute to osteoporosis, cardiovascular problems, and other diseases.
Due to these possible complications later in life, gynecologists and internists
begin measuring your height, keeping a closer eye on your cholesterol levels
and blood pressure readings, and monitoring your lifestyle habits (such as
exercise and diet) as you approach midlife.
Menopause is the time to review your diet, exercise routine, and unhealthy
habits (smoking or excessive consumption of alcohol, for example). In your
earlier life, your body was very forgiving. During menopause, it won’t let you
get away with unhealthy habits — you’ll pay. During menopause, gaining
weight is easier, and losing it is harder. And getting a good night’s sleep and
waking up feeling refreshed and ready to take on the day isn’t as easy as it
used to be. Make some healthy resolutions and stick with them so you don’t
wind up saying, like composer Eubie Blake said when he turned 100, “If I’d
known I was going to live this long, I’d have taken better care of myself.” We’ll
talk more about the benefits of a healthy lifestyle during and after menopause
in Chapter 20.
Seeking Out Support
One thing’s for sure as you look down that menopausal rocky road — and we
don’t just mean the kind in your freezer, though that might come in handy
from time to time. No, we mean it’s time to do what women do best: gather
your reinforcements and find some support.
Repeat after us: Menopause is a normal stage in a woman’s life. When symp-
toms make you uncomfortable and seem to last for years, going through
menopause can almost make us feel as if we’re ill. This is when it’s helpful to
have friends and family members make you repeat over and over “Menopause
is not a disease. Menopause is not a disease. Menopause is not a disease.”
29
Chapter 2: Talking Biology and Psychology

In the case of perimenopause, menopause, postmenopause — whatever you
want to call it — this means three things:
 Girlfriend power: Find some friends to rely on, women who have
already been there, done that, and bought the perspiration-wicking 
t-shirt. Your mom, your aunt, your sister, your best friend, or 600
strangers on an Internet message board — they’re all there for you. Just
remember — everyone’s menopause experience is different. Take all the
comfort and information your fellow gals can offer, but also take every-
thing you hear with a tiny (or not so tiny) grain of salt. If someone tells
you they’re fatigued, it’s appropriate to sympathize and wonder whether
that’s what you’ve been feeling. If you hear that someone is so tired they
spend most of their days in bed, feel free to suspect there might be
something else going on in their life. In which case it’s time to turn to.
 A supportive partner: You know the old saying, “If Mama ain’t happy,
ain’t nobody happy!” It’s the same with menopause. Just because your
true love isn’t sweating bullets in the middle of the night, or changing
moods as quickly as the local weather guy changes the forecast, doesn’t
mean that your sweet baboo isn’t affected by what you’re going through.
Family dynamics are like that: What one person experiences affects
everyone. If you’re single, you probably still have someone who plays
this role for you — someone who’s got your back when you’re facing a
deadline at work, your last good blouse is at the cleaners, and your hor-
mones are raging. It’s true what they say: We all need someone to lean on.
 Medical expertise: By this point in your adult life you probably know
how you feel about your healthcare provider — general practitioner,
internist, gynecologist, nurse-midwife, or alternative medicine practi-
tioner. You might love one of these and look forward to seeing the others
with the joy normally reserved for a root canal appointment. Or you may
have established a great relationship with one or two medical practition-
ers whom you trust and respect. This is a good time to take stock: Do
you trust the person who takes care of you? Do you see eye to eye on
the approach you want to take when the time comes to consider whether
to use hormone replacement therapy or alternative (sometimes called
complementary) treatments or a balance of the two? Or is it time to find
someone new you can turn to for information and support (and to tell
you at 11 o’clock at night that you’re probably not having a heart attack,
but you can come in anyway if you’d feel better)?
The point is clear. You don’t live in a vacuum, and neither should you go
through menopause in one. There are people and resources out there to help
you. And we’re here to be one of those.

T
hough it’s not something you think about a lot, you probably expected all
along to go through menopause sooner or later. Mostly later. But if you’re
one of the roughly 25 percent of women who experience early menopause
because of surgery or some other health factors, you’re now facing a whole
new game plan. You may be one of a significant number who find themselves
experiencing menopause way too early, often without much warning. You find
that the bookstore shelves aren’t exactly sagging under the weight of books
on early menopause, and that your own physician may not even recognize
the symptoms for what they truly are. 
Early menopause isn’t just regular menopause with bad timing. If you’re
already in early menopause, we don’t have to tell you that it’s far more com-
plicated than menopause arrived at the old fashioned way — by aging. And if
you’re facing this possibility now, the best thing you can do to protect your
health and your lifestyle is to educate yourself (and your friends, and your
family, and your doctor).
Which (blush) is why we’re here for you. We’re here so you can figure out
what’s going on. And why. And what to do about it. In this chapter, we discuss
some different ways in which menopause can sneak up on you and shout
“Boo!” before you are even remotely ready for it. While your girlfriends are
still stocking up on tampons and asking, “Is it hot in here, or was that my first
hot flash?” you’re looking menopause in the face. We’ll help you here with an
introduction to menopause — the early edition.

Understanding the Lingo 
As if one kind of menopause isn’t enough to go around, there are actually sev-
eral kinds, each with its own designation. And even though each one leads to
more or less the same outcome (the end of menstruation and fertility), there
are differences among them that will color your experience.
Here’s the obligatory “your mileage may vary” notice. Every case is different.
One woman might breeze through chemotherapy and still be fertile, while a
woman with a similar diagnosis experiences ovarian failure after such treat-
ments. Keep in mind that no two people or sets of circumstances are exactly
alike, so no two outcomes will be the same. So many variables are involved:
your personal health history, your genes and your family’s health history,
your age, body type, general level of health and fitness, environmental cir-
cumstances, lifestyle, and, of course, the nature, history, and extent of your
medical problem.
Induced menopause
Induced menopause occurs when your periods end because of some kind of
intervention that removes or damages your ovaries. In many cases this is the
result of surgery (surgical menopause), but radiation therapy, chemotherapy,
and some medications can also cause your ovaries to quit functioning (med-
ical menopause). 
Surgical menopause
Most cases of surgically induced menopause result from either the removal of
both ovaries (oophorectomy) or from a hysterectomy (surgical removal of
the uterus) that includes removal of the ovaries or results in the cutting off of
the blood supply to the ovaries. After your ovaries are removed, you are
immediately in menopause.
If you have just one healthy ovary, you can continue to produce estrogen and
stave off menopause, at least for a while. Women who have had a hysterec-
tomy but whose ovaries remain intact tend to go through natural menopause
a few years earlier than they might have otherwise. 
You can enter surgical menopause in a number of ways. Hysterectomy is the
most typical cause of surgical menopause. Oophorectomy (ovary removal)
may also be performed along with an elective hysterectomy in the case of
conditions that are not necessarily life-threatening but that have not
responded to any other medical treatments. 
32
Part I: The Main Facts about Menopause 

Fewer hysterectomies are performed these days for non-life threatening con-
ditions than was the case in even the recent past. Certainly this surgery is an
appropriate option under some circumstances. It is, however, an irreversible
option with long-term consequences. Don’t assume that the first suggestion
that you have a hysterectomy is the right decision for you. Get a second (and
a third and a fourth) opinion. Be sure to weigh in the potential for early
menopause when weighing up the costs and benefits of this procedure when
it is genuinely an elective choice.
Don’t be afraid of offending your doctor by asking for a second opinion. If
your doctor is truly looking out for your best interests, he or she should
applaud you for investigating all your options before having major surgery.
Some surgeries intended to treat non-reproductive health conditions may
also result in surgical menopause. Surgical treatment of colon cancer, for
example, may involve removal of the uterus and ovaries. The ovaries may
also be removed to treat disorders driven by or made worse in the presence
of plentiful estrogen. These might include breast cancer or endometriosis.
Medical menopause
Medical procedures and treatments beyond those requiring surgery can also
put you into menopause. These can include radiation therapy, chemotherapy,
and certain medications.
The fact that radiation and chemotherapy have been associated with medical
menopause in many cases doesn’t necessarily mean this will be true in your
case. Understand the risks and possible outcomes, but don’t give up hope
too soon. Every case is different.
Surgical removal of ovaries results in an immediate end to fertility. In cases in
which ovarian functioning has been damaged by medications or radiation,
fertility may decline more slowly and unpredictably. Be sure to talk with your
healthcare provider about the best way to protect against unplanned preg-
nancy during this transitional time.
Premature ovarian failure
Premature ovarian failure (POF) can occur at almost any age prior to the time
at which menopause would be considered natural. Finding out that you are in
menopause in your 30s, even in your 20s, can be devastating, particularly
because it means the end of your fertility.
POF not caused by one of the diseases or conditions described below affects
about one out of 100 women. Sometimes the cause of premature menopause
is never found, but it can be linked to a variety of conditions, among them:
33
Chapter 3: Fooling Mother Nature: Early Menopause

 Immune system disorders
 Severe anorexia
 Genetic disorders
 Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) 
 Chronic, severe physical stress, such as that sometimes experienced by
professional athletes or those with exercise anorexia
 Nutritional deficits
 Pituitary tumors 
Because POF can occur so much earlier than you would expect to start iden-
tifying perimenopausal symptoms, those first hot flashes and skipped peri-
ods might not make you jump up and say, “Aha! This could be menopause!”
Trouble is, it might not make your doctor say this, either. Although POF is
rarely reversible, there are cases in which an early diagnosis and treatment of
the underlying problem could mean the salvation of your ovaries — derailing
that menopause train that’s pulled out of the station way ahead of schedule.
If you even suspect that what you’re experiencing sounds similar to meno-
pause, bring this concern to the attention of your healthcare provider, and do
whatever gentle prodding (or jumping up and down) it takes to get the blood
tests that could point you to a correct — and well-timed — diagnosis.
Coping with Sudden Change 
After you pull the plug on estrogen production — either in one big whoosh or
one prolonged trickle — unless you begin taking HT, your body is going to be
subject to the same changes (see Chapter 4) and risks (see Chapters 11
through 14) that you’d experience in natural menopause. The biggest differ-
ence is in the timing: when it occurs, and how fast it happens. The younger
you are when you experience early menopause, the greater the number of
years you will have to cope with the consequences. Making decisions about
your health and whether to take replacement HT early on, as well as contin-
ued monitoring of your hormone levels (see the next section “Knowing when
you hit menopause”), are crucial.
Knowing when you hit menopause
We define menopause as reaching the one-year anniversary of your last
period. But if your uterus is gone, you can’t have a period. How do you know
when you clear that hurdle? The only way to know is by keeping an eye on
your other symptoms — restless sleep, hot flashes, heart palpitations —
34
Part I: The Main Facts about Menopause 

the whole nine yards. If you experience the classic perimenopausal symp-
toms, you’re probably entering perimenopause and your hormones are dip-
ping and cresting like waves in a storm. You’re probably menopausal when
your symptoms settle down and the seas are calmer. If you’re not sure, ask
your physician for a hormone test that can tell you what your menopause
status is. 
Women who have had hysterectomies but who still have one or both ovaries
often go through menopause one to three years earlier than women who
haven’t.
Getting the help you need 
for your body and mind
Estradiol (or E2), which your ovaries produce, is like a magic serum for your
body. In addition to promoting breast development, bringing on your men-
strual cycles, and helping you get (and stay) pregnant, estradiol has lots of
other roles to play in promoting and protecting your health. It keeps your tis-
sues (inside and out) moist and supple, helps you to grow strong bones (and
you thought it was just the Wonder Bread), promotes normal sexual develop-
ment, and plays many other roles throughout your body. 
If the source (that is, your ovaries) of this wonderful stuff dries up — regard-
less of whether the cause is surgical, pharmaceutical, genetic, or something
altogether different — then you may not even have achieved your peak health
and strength by the time your hormones disappear. Not having had the full
benefit of your hormones to start with can make it doubly hard to keep your
whole body in its best working order when menopause begins to make
demands on your bones, your sexual health, and your overall well-being.
Women in induced or premature menopause who are not taking hormone
therapy are faced almost immediately with increased risk of a number of
health problems. All these are associated with loss of estrogen, so hormone
therapy does alleviate these risks. (We say more about these risks in
Chapters 11 through 14.) Your caregiver can help you to cope with these
sudden changes by working with you to find a medical regimen that mini-
mizes menopausal symptoms while maximizing your overall health outlook.
Even if children (or more children) weren’t officially in your plans, losing
your ability to conceive can be a shaker (for you and the people who care
about you). Losing your options can be difficult, too. Seeing your periods
come and go every month can also be a marker, a healthy part of your func-
tioning. It’s okay to grieve this loss (and to get help in doing so), even if you
are still figuring out what it means for you. Recognize your feelings and talk
with a counselor or therapist about what’s happening to you.
35
Chapter 3: Fooling Mother Nature: Early Menopause

Prepping for Surgical Menopause 
If your physician anticipates that your ovaries will both be removed or dam-
aged during your surgery, she knows that you’ll wake up in an uncomfortable
state of hormone depletion. To help you make a slightly smoother transition
to this new state of affairs, she may start you on hormone supplements prior
to your surgery (if she’s not sure about what she’ll find during surgery, she
may want to wait and start HT after your operation). Although every situa-
tion is different and most are more complex than this, the type of hormone
therapy you are given depends largely — to put it bluntly — on what had to
be removed during your surgery. If you still have a uterus, you will most
likely be given combination hormone therapy (HT) with estrogen and proges-
terone balanced just for you to prevent cancer. If you’ve had a hysterectomy,
then you will be given estrogen therapy (ET) because it can replace your
missing estrogen with no increased risk of uterine cancer (the uterus now
being gone, remember).
A hysterectomy with your ovaries left in place technically shouldn’t slow
down the ovaries’ production of hormones. You should go through natural
menopause (though perhaps a little sooner) if your ovaries are still intact and
producing hormones. 
While you are preparing for the hysterectomy you will have lots of questions
for your surgeon and your general practitioner, internist, or gynecologist.
Before surgery is a good time to talk about what to expect in the way of hor-
mone-related effects, both immediately after surgery and in the long run.
Because this is a very stressful time, especially if you only found out recently
that you have a condition that requires surgery, you may find yourself a little
rattled. Right near the list of the top 10 things that make you forgetful is
having your doctor look up and say brightly, “Do you have any questions?”
This is the universal signal for forgetting everything you wanted to ask, which
is why it’s a good idea to keep a running list. No question is too small — or
too large — to tackle. Questions to ask about menopause-related outcomes of
your surgery might include:
 How likely is it that my ovaries will still be functional after my uterus is
removed? How great a risk is there that the ovaries will have to be
removed, too?
 If my ovaries are removed or damaged, how will that change how I feel
after the surgery? What sorts of symptoms might I experience? How
soon will these begin?
 What kinds of decisions will I need to make about hormone therapy fol-
lowing the surgery?
36
Part I: The Main Facts about Menopause 

 Do you recommend that I begin any hormone therapy before my surgery?
 I have concerns about some of the risks I’ve heard about from women
taking hormone therapy. How do these apply in my case?
If your surgery is to treat a severe or life-threatening illness, don’t let anyone
make you feel that you’re being petty or trivial worrying about menopause
when all you “should” be worrying about is beating your breast cancer or
curing that chronic infection. Certainly you will have questions about both
the reasons for the surgery and the possible outcomes — that’s entirely
normal. But if your doctor says, “We can talk about all that after your surgery,”
be persistent. She may not be able to give you all the answers you need yet,
but it’s entirely justifiable to want — and get — some sense of what you may
be facing after the surgery.
Taking Advantage of Assisted Living
No, no, we don’t mean the kind your Great Aunt Natalie lives in, with the hot
meals and the Bingo games on Saturdays. But under your new circumstances
your doctor will most likely suggest very strongly that you go — and soon —
on some form of hormone therapy. Hormones got you into this strange new
place, by leaving you — literally — in the lurch. And hormones —adminis-
tered with care and patience — can get you out again, or at least play an
important role as you try to get a grip on the changes in your body and your
mind that accompany induced or premature menopause.
As with natural menopause, whether you decide to take hormone replace-
ment therapy is entirely your call. The difference that you need to factor in as
you make this decision is all about the timing. Many women experiencing nat-
ural menopause take hormones for just a few years, until they are over the
most bothersome of their menopausal symptoms. You will need to rely on
hormone therapy indefinitely to ward off the effects of menopause until you
reach the time at which you and your doctor feel you’d be postmenopausal
even by natural menopause standards. At that point, you can work together
to decide whether remaining on hormones is in your best interest, or
whether it’s time to wean you off of them.
Estrogen alone
If you have had your uterus removed, you no longer need to fear that taking
estrogen will contribute to uterine cancer. This means you can control your
menopausal symptoms and reap the benefits of replacement estrogen as it
wards off the health risks described above.
37
Chapter 3: Fooling Mother Nature: Early Menopause

The especially good news for you (you knew there had to be some good news
somewhere, right?) is that new findings coming out of the 15-year-long
Women’s Health Initiative Study says that for women who have had a hys-
terectomy and who are between the ages of 50 and 59, and only for this group,
estrogen therapy not only doesn’t damage the heart, but it can actually pro-
tect you from heart disease.
Combination therapy
With progesterone (and perhaps testosterone) added to the recipe to help
balance the risks of uterine cancer, women who have had their ovaries
removed but who still have an intact uterus can minimize their risk of other
menopausal health problems.
It’s important to note that, especially with combination therapy, one size defi-
nitely does not fit all. What worked for your mother may not work for you.
The balance of hormones that puts your best friend in the pink may leave
you feeling bluer than blue. Be patient as your physician works with you to
find the right balance — and the right dosage — of therapeutic hormones.
You may also hear a lot about the synthetic hormone DHEA if you surf the
Internet or cruise the shelves of your local natural foods store. To listen to
the manufacturer’s claims, you’d think that DHEA is the ultimate wonder
drug, replacing or supplementing your body’s natural hormones to cure what
ails you. Be very careful, though. Although there have been many claims
about its symptom-relieving, vitality-giving qualities, no long-term studies
have proven DHEA to be either effective or safe. Some of its known side
effects (deepening of the voice, thickening of the skin, facial hair growth, and
headaches) are as troublesome as the symptoms you’re trying to free your-
self from. If you’re interested in learning more about this steroid hormone,
ask your physician before you try it on your own.
If you do decide to use DHEA by itself or in combination with other forms of
HT, do not use or suddenly discontinue its use without the supervision of a
physician. 
Got a uterus? Your hormone therapy will probably be a balanced mix of the
hormones normally produced by the ovaries: estrogen and progesterone, or
even estrogen, progesterone, and a bit of testosterone. If you’ve had a hys-
terectomy (no uterus), you can take estrogen-alone therapy (ET).
38
Part I: The Main Facts about Menopause 

Alternatives to HT
Certainly if you are still wary of hormone therapy, there are practical, situa-
tional remedies you can try. Some women find relief in simple approaches to
symptom control: 
 Find fixes for your hot flashes. Sleep in a cool room with a window
partly open, even in cold weather. Keep a pitcher of cool water on your
nightstand, and sleep on 100 percent cotton sheets. If you find that alco-
hol or spicy foods contribute to your hot flashes, avoid them.
 Get a good night’s sleep. Make your bedroom a calming place and don’t
use it for work or exercise. Get plenty of exercise every day, but not
within an hour or two of bedtime. A warm, caffeine-free drink before
bed — warm milk, herbal tea, or hot lemonade — can help you relax. If
you wake up for long periods during the night, get up and read quietly,
or engage in a simple activity such as knitting or reading so that you
don’t come to associate your bed with sleeplessness.
 Calm your moods. Practice meditation or yoga and breathing exercises
every day. 
 Take good care of yourself. Get plenty of rest, maintain a healthy
weight, and don’t smoke. 
 Protect your bones. Do some weight-bearing exercise at least five days a
week. Smoking also compromises bone health — if you smoke, stop. 
39
Chapter 3: Fooling Mother Nature: Early Menopause
And your grandmother on your mother’s side?
If you experience induced or premature
menopause at very nearly the age at which you
would have expected to start natural
menopause, you may have more leeway when it
comes to deciding whether to take hormones.
Here are some things you need to consider
when making this decision:
 Your age and general health
 Any family history of DVT (deep vein throm-
bosis), pulmonary embolism (blood clots
that have traveled to your lungs), or other
blood clots; any family history of stroke
(hormone therapy can increase the risk of
these)
 Any family history of breast cancer (estro-
gen therapy can promote the growth of
breast cancer cells)
 Whether you smoke (hormones and smok-
ing are a time bomb combination, greatly
increasing the risk of other dangers, such
as that of stroke or blood clots)
 Any family history of osteoporosis, which
hormone therapy would help to prevent 

Ask your physician for recommendations for herbal remedies to fight hot
flashes and insomnia if you want to. Bear in mind, though, that few herbal
preparations are regulated in the United States, so you may be getting more
or less than the label indicates, and the product may not be as clean or free
from additives as you’d like to think. Remember, too, that herbs aren’t neces-
sarily any safer, or any more effective, than pharmaceutical hormones. Keep
an open mind, but make sure your health and safety are your first concern,
whether you rely on traditional medicines, alternative products, or a combi-
nation that balances the best of both.
Finding Support: Birds of a Feather 
Taking care of yourself and getting support from people who understand
your situation is especially important for women experiencing early
menopause. Your issues, in many cases, are different from those of women
who go through natural menopause at the expected time in their lives and you
may need to go a little further out of your way than to the next cubicle at the
office or your best friends to find women who know what you’re going
through.
People who don’t “get” premature menopause are usually people who just
haven’t been educated yet. Try to keep this in mind when people ask you
questions about your situation or assume they know what you’re going
through (when they don’t). Even people who care a great deal about you may
say things to you that cause you pain or distress. 
Ask your healthcare provider whether she knows of a support group in your
area for women with early menopause. Or find a supportive message board
online (feel free to lurk a while, or read the boards without becoming a
member) until you find one that seems to offer genuine help and accurate
information.
And don’t forget that the answers to your questions may be found in the
upcoming chapters in this book. Although your situation may be different
from that of most women, in many ways you are all going through the same
things, even if you’re on different timetables.
As you’re making decisions about hormone therapy and your continuing
care, try to find at least one woman to speak with who went into early
menopause years ago. Get the benefit of her hindsight by asking whether she
is happy with the decisions she made, and whether — given ongoing
advances in our understanding of hormone therapy — she thinks she would
make the same decisions today. Are there things she wishes she had done dif-
ferently? What things were relatively easy to handle, and what were some
that were the most difficult? What surprised her the most? Did she find any
unexpected silver linings in this cloud?

Getting In Sync with the
Symptoms
In This Chapter
 Getting in touch with the changes before the change
 Discovering the physical and emotional effects of menopause
 Talking to your doctor
You’re irritable for no reason, you have trouble sleeping, you experience
heart palpitations, and you’re sure somebody keeps sneaking the ther-
mostat up when you’re not looking. Sound familiar? If so, you’re almost cer-
tainly starting down the road to menopause.
Every human body is unique — that’s no surprise. But the path to
menopause reveals just how different we really are. Some women breeze
through the change, experiencing very few physical discomforts or emotional
upsets. Other women experience a whole menu of disturbing symptoms for a
number of years. Fortunately, for most women the symptoms often pass as
you move into menopause and beyond.
In this chapter, we provide an introduction to the perimenopausal and
menopausal symptoms you may experience. We go into much greater detail
concerning the biology of menopause and how to alleviate these symptoms
in other chapters of this book (especially in Chapters 5 through 10).
The symptoms we discuss in this chapter are all symptoms of peri-
menopause or menopause, but they’re not unique to just perimenopause 
or menopause. Other medical conditions — or even normal variations —
cause these symptoms as well. If you experience any symptoms that worry
you, though, don’t just assume that they’re a result of perimenopause or
menopause. Your doctor will help you rule out any more serious causes.

Kicking Things Off with Perimenopausal
Symptoms
In this section we give you the laundry list of symptoms that have been
attributed to the sudden drops of estrogen during perimenopause. Individual
women experience none, a few, or quite a few of these symptoms. If you think
we sound a little vague about what perimenopausal symptoms are like, we’re
guilty as charged, but we have to hedge our bets because everyone’s experi-
ence with menopause is unique.
In fact, many women in the United States report experiencing no peri-
menopausal symptoms at all. For women who do experience symptoms, the
symptoms can range in severity from being somewhat annoying to interfering
with their ability to enjoy life. 
Getting physical
If you do have physical symptoms as you enter and go through peri-
menopause and menopause, though, you may find them hard to ignore.
They’re just, well, different. People often compare reaching menopause with
hitting puberty, but approaching adolescence didn’t bring on hot flashes, hair
loss, insomnia, or heart palpitations.
Many of the physical symptoms are the result of a string of events that are
set in motion when estradiol (the active form of estrogen — the “good” stuff)
levels suddenly drop — a typical occurrence during perimenopause. The
drop causes a chain reaction within your body, which we describe in the
“Revealing the biology behind the symptoms” sidebar later in this chapter.
The relationship between estrogen and serotonin plays a role in many of 
the mental symptoms, but it also has a hand in some of the physical symp-
toms — such as interrupted sleep. Serotonin is a compound that helps the
body regulate sleep and moods. Though all the details aren’t in, estrogen
plays some kind of role in the production and maintenance of serotonin. It’s
amazing how all this stuff gets connected, huh?
Turning up the heat
Hot flashes (also called hot flushes) are the traditional, highly recognized
symptom of menopause — 85 percent of women have them at least a time or
two as they enter perimenopause, and 10 to 15 percent of women report
having them often enough or severely enough to seek medical treatment.
When you have a hot flash, you suddenly feel intensely warm and very
flushed — especially in your face and upper body. Increased perspiration —
anything from a moist upper lip to enough sweat to leave your clothes or
42
Part I: The Main Facts about Menopause 

bedsheets uncomfortably wet — usually accompanies this feeling of warmth.
And sometimes, dizziness, heart palpitations, and a suffocating feeling can
precede or accompany hot flashes. As many comediennes have said, it feels
as though your inner child is playing with matches.
A sudden drop in estrogen levels triggers a hot flash. This drop in estrogen
sends a message to your brain that something is terribly wrong, so your brain
sends out a power burst of adrenaline (norepinephrine). Norepinephrine is the
hormone that triggers the fight-or-flight response in humans, so your body
moves into ready mode, which gets your blood pressure up and your heart
pounding and also causes the blood vessels in your head, neck, and chest to
dilate. All this commotion brings on that sweltering feeling.
Until 1970, doctors didn’t acknowledge hot flashes as a real physical phenome-
non; they attributed the sensation to a woman’s imagination or to a psychologi-
cal problem. In fact, though, the effect of hot flashes is real and measurable —
ask anyone who’s ever slept next to a woman when her internal thermostat
goes haywire. The temperature of your skin may go up as much as six degrees,
as if you had a fever. The symptom is only temporary, though, typically lasting
no more than 10 minutes or so. Hot flashes aren’t dangerous, but the first time
or two that you have one, it can be mighty scary unless you’ve been warned to
expect them.
Sweating your lack of sleep
Night sweats are essentially hot flashes that occur at night. The same estro-
gen drop that triggers hot flashes during the day triggers night sweats.
Night sweats can also be caused by infection, thyroid problems, or other
types of illness, so if this is the only seemingly perimenopausal symptom you
experience, check with your doctor.
Losing your snoozing time
With all the weird symptoms going on during the day, getting a good night’s
sleep so you can wake up feeling rested doesn’t seem like a lot to ask for, but
lack of sleep during this period can be a real problem. Hot flashes in the
middle of the night often result in interrupted sleep. You wake up, often per-
spiring (and sometimes cursing), with damp bedsheets and skin that may end
up being itchy as you cool off and all that sweat dries, and have a hard time
going back to sleep. If your sleep is often interrupted this way, you can build
up quite a sleep deficit, which in turn leads to irritability, anxiety, and mood
swings.
Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that’s found throughout your body, especially
in your brain. A neurotransmitter is a chemical that sends messages from one
nerve cell to another. There’s still a lot we don’t know about serotonin and its
functions, but it’s clear that it can act to affect our muscles, nerves, and
moods.
43
Chapter 4: Getting In Sync with the Symptoms

A rapid drop in estrogen also affects your serotonin levels. Serotonin helps
regulate mood and sleep patterns. (Drugs such as Prozac and Zoloft work on
the principle that serotonin regulation is key to relieving mood swings, irri-
tability, and so on.) Estrogen makes serotonin more available by prolonging
its action. When estrogen drops, it affects your serotonin levels, which con-
tributes to interrupted sleep. 
Getting to the heart of the palpitation issue
Butterflies in your stomach often accompany rapid heartbeats, or palpitations.
The sudden drops in estrogen that are so common during perimenopause
cause reactions all over your body (see the “Revealing the biology behind the
symptoms” sidebar later in this chapter), including heart flutters. The drop in
estrogen causes your body’s natural painkillers and mood regulators (endor-
phins) to drop. Your body interprets this state of affairs as trouble, so a com-
mand is issued to send out a burst of adrenaline (norepinephrine, the
fight-or-flight hormone). Your body is responding as though you had just
encountered a big grizzly bear. The only trouble is you don’t see the grizzly
bear, and you’re left wondering why your body suddenly decided to get ready
to flee from it just when you sat down to a nice candle-lit dinner.
Expecting menstrual irregularities
The approach to menopause can be blamed for a number of menstrual
changes. But remember that you can’t blame all irregularities on peri-
menopause. Consult your healthcare provider about the following irregulari-
ties and all other symptoms before simply writing them off to
perimenopause:
 Irregular periods are quite common in perimenopausal women because
fluctuating hormone levels can interrupt the ovulation cycle. Some
months you ovulate; some months you don’t. If you don’t ovulate, you
don’t produce enough progesterone to have a period, so the lining of
your uterus builds up.
 Heavy bleeding during perimenopause is usually caused by an “eggless”
cycle. You make estrogen during the first part of your cycle, but for
some reason (often unknown), you just don’t ovulate. Therefore, you
don’t produce progesterone, and you develop an unusually thick uterine
lining, which you shed during your period. This process translates into
abnormally heavy bleeding.
 Bad timing has probably struck every woman at one point or another.
We just don’t want you to think that perimenopause is going to make
dealing with your periods easier. As long as you still have periods,
they’re liable to show up at inconvenient times (which can help make
getting rid of them not sound like a bad thing at all).
44
Part I: The Main Facts about Menopause 

If you have unusual bleeding in-between your cycles though, you should con-
sult your doctor. This may be a sign of abnormal cells developing in the lining
of your uterus that should not be ignored.
Handling the headaches
For women who experience migraine headaches immediately before or during
the first few days of their periods, we have some bad news — you may have
more headaches during perimenopause. Headaches during the first few days
of your period mean that you’re sensitive to low estrogen levels, which are
typical at that time. When estrogen levels drop quickly, which happens during
perimenopause, the drop may trigger another one of those headaches. Just as
your estrogen level has become unpredictable, so might your headaches. Just
as you’re congratulating yourself for being headache-free in June, July might
bring on a doozy.
45
Chapter 4: Getting In Sync with the Symptoms
Revealing the biology behind the symptoms
As you may have suspected, the symptoms of
menopause are all tied to plunging hormone
levels. You may feel these symptoms more fre-
quently during perimenopause than menopause
itself because your hormone levels fluctuate more
during perimenopause. Sometimes they rise to
fairly normal levels, and then they come crashing
down. The fluctuation is the trigger for a lot of the
symptoms. In menopause, hormone levels are
consistently lower than they are during your
reproductive years, so they don’t pop up and drop
down so frequently, though symptoms can still
occur.
Here’s a step-by-step guide of what happens to
your body when your estradiol (the active form of
estrogen) levels drop:
1. Your ovaries produce lower levels of estra-
diol, which causes a drop in the amount of
estradiol reaching the brain.
2. Less estradiol in the brain causes a decrease
in your endorphin levels. Endorphins are your
body’s natural painkillers and mood regula-
tors. (If you’re a runner, you’re probably
familiar with the effects of endorphins —
they cause the “runner’s high.”)
3. Lower levels of endorphins in your brain
cause it to think that something is terribly
wrong, so it sends out a burst of adrenaline,
namely norepinephrine (the hormone that
triggers the fight-or-flight response).
4. The burst of norepinephrine causes your
body to kick into ready-for-anything mode
by increasing your heart rate (which causes
those palpitations and flutters), raising your
blood pressure, and dilating your blood ves-
sels. Dilating blood vessels cause the hot
flashes and sweating. If you’re asleep, you
may wake up suddenly. You may also expe-
rience diarrhea or get a feeling of anxiety
and butterflies in your stomach.

Facing the fibroid factoids
Fibroids are simply balls of uterine muscle tissue. Nearly one-third of women
have fibroids by the time they’re 50. Fibroids tend to get bigger as you
approach menopause, but they usually don’t continue to grow in size after
menopause.
You really don’t need to do anything about fibroids unless they cause symp-
toms such as pain, pressure, or increased bleeding. As with other symptoms,
talk with your doctor if you’re having any problems you feel may be related
to fibroids.
Playing head games
The mental/emotional symptoms associated with perimenopause can be very
frustrating given that many women don’t associate their recent irritability or
depression with perimenopause.
The symptoms we list generally pass when your hormones settle into their
new, lower levels after menopause. However, these symptoms severely incon-
venience or otherwise bother many women during perimenopause. If this
description mirrors your situation, there’s no need to sit there suffering in
silence.
Be sure to inform your medical professional about these mental and emo-
tional symptoms. They may be more closely related to hormonal imbalances
than to psychological issues. But, either way, your healthcare professional
can ensure that you get the proper treatment to alleviate your symptoms.
(For more detailed information on the mental and emotional issues associ-
ated with perimenopause, check out Chapter 10.)
Sitting on the mood swings
Mood swings are common among perimenopausal women. But remember
that mood swings are also common before your period (part of premenstrual
syndrome) and after pregnancy. Although medical researchers don’t know all
the details, low levels of estrogen are associated with lower levels of sero-
tonin, which can lead to mood swings, in addition to irritability, anxiety, pain
sensitivity, and insomnia.
Worrying about anxiety
Anxiety is another common symptom perimenopausal women face. As with
mood swings, anxiety seems to be tied to low levels of estrogen. The lower
levels of endorphins and serotonin associated with low estrogen levels may
46
Part I: The Main Facts about Menopause 

trigger anxiety. Another theory is that low levels of estrogen, serotonin, and
endorphins leave you more vulnerable to the emotional stressors in your
world. According to this theory, lower estrogen, serotonin, and endorphin
levels don’t trigger anxiety; they simply limit your ability to deal successfully
with stressful situations.
Touching on irritability
The same hormonal shifts that cause mood swings and anxiety (see the previ-
ous “Sitting on the mood swings” and “Worrying about anxiety” sections)
cause irritability. As with these other symptoms, marked irritability is a tem-
porary condition that seems to blow over after you’re officially menopausal
(if you can put up with yourself for that long).
Recalling memory malfunctions
Memory problems during perimenopause sneak up on you. You forget your
friend’s name one day; you leave your keys somewhere in the grocery store
another day. Pretty soon you start remembering how many times you couldn’t
remember something. We’re not talking about dementia or Alzheimer’s dis-
ease here; we’re talking about forgetfulness and a lack of focus. This category
covers relatively minor memory glitches: You forget where you’re going with
a thought in mid-sentence, or you get to the store and forget what you need
to buy. Thank goodness for sticky notes and grocery lists.
Estrogen seems to facilitate communication among neurons (nerve cells) in
the brain. Much of memory is a matter of the brain sending information from
one memory storage center to another. Because estrogen helps maintain con-
nections and grow new ones, shifting estrogen levels can stymie communica-
tion between memory storage areas. Memory problems seem to be a short-
term issue; some women seem to lose the memory lapses after menopause.
Indications from later stages of the Women’s Health Initiative seem to be that
for women 65 and older only, hormone therapy is associated with an increase
in the risk for dementia and overall cognitive functioning. Because this is the
opposite of what researchers in this large, 15-year study predicted they’d
find, follow-up studies of the relationship between hormone therapy and a
decline in cognitive functioning are continuing. There’s no official word yet
on the effects of hormone therapy in younger women on dementia, cognitive
functioning, or memory.
Even though the Women’s Health Initiative Study reported a statistically sig-
nificant increase in the risk of dementia among women between 65 and 79
who were using either combination (estrogen plus progestin) hormone ther-
apy, the overall risk of Alzheimer’s in the United States is still extremely low. 
47
Chapter 4: Getting In Sync with the Symptoms

Thinking through a haze
Fuzzy thinking is common when you’re deprived of sleep or your hormones
are in flux. When we say fuzzy thinking, we mean the feeling that you’re just
not with it today — as though you’re walking through a fog or you just can’t
concentrate on what you’re doing. Fuzzy thinking can be the result of inter-
rupted sleep (which is extremely common during perimenopause).
Fluctuating hormone levels also cause fuzzy thinking (as you may have experi-
enced during pregnancy or at certain points in your menstrual cycle). Fuzzy
thinking is a temporary thing. It generally clears up when your hormones
settle down and your sleep patterns chill out during menopause. Experiencing
little brain farts now and then doesn’t mean that you’re on the slippery slope
to premature senility — this will pass.
Visiting the Menopausal Symptoms
All the symptoms we describe as perimenopausal have long been attributed
to menopause. But after you’re menopausal (without a menstrual period for a
year), things begin to settle down a bit. Hot flashes subside and your moods
stabilize. Your body and psyche seem to get used to some aspects of lower
estrogen production. A small percentage of women may continue to experi-
ence menopausal symptoms for years after their periods end.
The symptoms experienced after menopause may even be a bit more uncom-
fortable physically. If this describes you, don’t just suffer — work with your
physician to help you find a hormonal or non-hormonal treatment to keep
you comfortable.
Long periods of low levels of estrogen encourage conditions such as osteo-
porosis, cardiovascular disease, heart attack, stroke, colon cancer, and other
diseases discussed in Chapters 5 and 6 of this book.
To avoid wordiness, we use the term menopause in this chapter (and most
others) to refer to the time period that incorporates both menopause and
postmenopause.
Figuring out the physical facts
After you officially reach menopause (after 12 full months without a men-
strual period), you produce lower levels of estrogen without the sudden
spikes and drops typical of perimenopause. Your hormones calm down —
way down. As time goes by, these long periods of low estrogen levels result in
some physical changes.
48
Part I: The Main Facts about Menopause 

In this section, we discuss what these conditions feel like. We go into greater
detail about the biology behind these conditions and how to alleviate the
symptoms in other chapters of this book. (Chapter 7 deals with vaginal and
urinary issues; Chapter 8 covers your skin and hair during menopause.)
Some of the symptoms are the result of lower levels of estrogen, pure and
simple. We call these primary symptoms. Some of these primary symptoms
can actually cause further unpleasantness, which we call secondary 
symptoms.
Looking first at the primary symptoms
The primary symptoms include
 Vaginal dryness: The medical establishment refers to this condition as
vaginal atrophy. Because estrogen keeps vaginal tissues moisturized and
pliant, continuous periods of low estrogen can result in the drying out
and shrinking of vaginal tissue. Between 20 and 45 percent of women in
the United States experience vaginal dryness. They often notice it when
intercourse becomes painful due to a lack of lubrication.
 Vulvar discomfort: Itching, burning, and dryness of the vulva isn’t
uncommon among menopausal women. But remember that many condi-
tions and diseases that affect the vulva have nothing to do with estro-
gen, so have your doctor check out any vulvar changes.
 Urinary incontinence: This condition is much more prevalent in women
during perimenopause and menopause than it is during their earlier
reproductive years. The tissues of your urinary tract become drier and
thinner, and the muscles lose their tone as estrogen levels diminish. You
know you’re experiencing urinary incontinence if you have a hard time
holding it when you laugh, exercise, or sneeze. Your urinary tract, espe-
cially your urethra, depends on estrogen to maintain its form and
muscle tone. The urethra has a hard time sealing off the flow of urine
after years of diminished estrogen levels.
 Urinary frequency: Similar to incontinence, urinary frequency results
from sustained, low levels of estrogen that define menopause. Urinary
frequency simply means that you have to urinate frequently. You may
leave the bathroom and quickly feel as though you have to go again.
This condition can be very frustrating during the day — and even more
frustrating at night. Urinary frequency can also cause interrupted sleep,
which understandably, turns into irritability.
 Headaches: Women who experience their first migraine during peri-
menopause often find that the migraines go away after menopause.
 Skin changes: Lower estrogen levels cause your skin to lose firmness
and elasticity. Estrogen doesn’t literally prevent sagging or wrinkles. But
estrogen does keep your skin supple and help your skin retain fluid, so it
remains “filled out” rather than becoming loose and droopy.
49
Chapter 4: Getting In Sync with the Symptoms

 Hair changes: Your hair becomes thinner and more brittle with
menopause, though some women report that their hair feels as soft and
fluffy as cotton several years into menopause. Estrogen seems to pro-
mote your body’s natural moisturizers, so with lower levels of the stuff
flowing through your body, your hair takes a hit and becomes more brit-
tle and wiry. You also have a tougher time keeping a perm permanent.
Some women, though, also note that their hair has more body than it
used to, and find that they no longer need to shampoo every day to keep
their now somewhat drier hair looking good.
 Weight changes: Your weight shifts to the center of your body — around
your waist. Instead of the lovely hourglass shape you once had, you take
on more of an apple-shaped appearance due to shifting hormone levels.
Although you may gain a bit of weight, you probably can’t directly blame
that on hormonal changes. Your body simply becomes less forgiving
about nutritional imbalances and poor eating, drinking, and exercise
habits.
Leading to the secondary conditions
It’s not over yet. One or more of the primary symptoms can trigger even
more unpleasantness. Here you go:
 Painful intercourse: Vaginal dryness and changes in the shape of the
vagina can lead to discomfort or pain during intercourse. As low levels
of estrogen cause your urovaginal tissues (tissues of the vagina and uri-
nary tract) to become thinner and the supporting muscle to lose its
tone, your organs naturally shift position a bit.
 Interrupted sleep: Hot flashes, urinary frequency, anxiety, and a variety
of other menopausal symptoms can cause interrupted sleep during the
night. You wake up tired and feel fatigued throughout the day because
your body isn’t able to enter the deep stages of sleep at night that make
you feel resilient and energetic.
 Fatigue: If you consistently don’t get a good restful night’s sleep or you
experience insomnia, you may become fatigued. But fatigue can also be
the result of low testosterone levels.
Discovering that it’s more than skin deep
The mental/emotional aspects of menopause are more of a mixed bag. Some
symptoms experienced during menopause usually decrease or go away com-
pletely; others are a bit more difficult to deal with.
50
Part I: The Main Facts about Menopause 

 Anxiety: The anxiety common during perimenopause is often caused by
the rapid drop in estrogen, which initiates a chain reaction (see the
“Revealing the biology behind the symptoms” sidebar earlier in this
chapter). After menopause, unexplained anxiety often dies down, and
you return to your normal self.
 Depression: Women who have had hysterectomies are more likely to
experience menopause-related depression than are women who go
through a natural menopause. Researchers don’t yet understand why
this is the case, but it’s likely that physical, mental, and cultural factors
all play a part.
Also, women who have been on estrogen and suddenly quit taking it,
rather than going through a weaning process, also have more problems
with depression. Estrogen assists in the production of serotonin (a sub-
stance which helps regulate moods), so lower levels of estrogen can
mean lower levels of serotonin.
 Lower libido: Decreased sex drive is a problem for many menopausal
women, but the good news is that 70 percent of women remain sexually
active during their perimenopausal and menopausal years. Lower libido
can be traced to hormonal imbalances and may be the result of testos-
terone levels being too low. (For more information on menopause and
your libido, take a look at Chapter 9.)
 Memory lapses and fuzzy thinking: Though memory lapses and fuzzy
thinking are common during perimenopause, most women notice their
concentration and memory return to normal after menopause. Aging can
cause mental impairment later in life, but you can’t blame everything on
menopause! Remember, though, that recent research has found an asso-
ciation between continued use of hormone therapy after age 65 and a
heightened (but still small) risk of dementia. If you are still using hor-
mone therapy at this point, talk with your doctor about whether the rea-
sons you continued hormone use to this point are still valid.
Understanding That It’s 
Not Your Imagination
Many people associate the word symptom with disease, but the definition we
use throughout this book is much closer to the dictionary definition — a con-
dition or event that accompanies something. If you’re like many women, you
may feel that weird things keep happening to your body or your emotions. 
51
Chapter 4: Getting In Sync with the Symptoms

Maybe you feel a flutter in your chest, and you become convinced that you’re
on the verge of a heart attack. If you go to a cardiologist to check out heart
palpitations, she probably won’t even think to check your hormones because
she’s looking for something in your heart to answer the riddle.
Or maybe the “weird things” going on with you aren’t physical at all. Maybe
they’re emotional — such as becoming easily frustrated at work or chewing
your kids out 50 times a day for the last two weeks. Many women may think
twice about these symptoms, but they don’t bring them up with their doctor.
If you do mention them to your doctor, she may say something such as, “It’s
nothing.” Nothing? We know what you’re thinking, “Try telling that to my co-
workers and my kids.”
Even gynecologists sometimes overlook a hormonal imbalance as the source
of symptoms. Women may suspect that their problem is “chemical” or hor-
monal only to have doctors say that they’re too young for menopause or that
they’re still having periods, so they aren’t menopausal.
Some gynecologists go so far as to give a blood test to check your FSH 
(follicle-stimulating hormone) level to rule out menopause. High levels of FSH
are indicative of menopause. But during perimenopause, your hormone levels
go up and down. One month your FSH may be perfectly normal; another
month it may be high. Without getting tested month after month, determining
whether you’re perimenopausal is difficult.
But women’s estrogen and testosterone levels can (and usually do) get out of
whack even before they officially become menopausal, and the imbalance trig-
gers the annoying symptoms often associated with menopause. Sometimes
you can become even more frustrated after seeking medical advice because
the experts tell you, “It’s nothing,” or they alarm you with the number and
types of tests they want you to take.
The reality is that the symptoms you experience are often more intense
before menopause, during perimenopause, than they are after you make the
change. After you get a hot flash or two, you may figure out that these “weird
things” aren’t part of your imagination and that you’re getting close to
menopause. If you figure out the connection, consider yourself lucky. Few
women realize that the heart palpitations and the irritability can be part of
the same condition — perimenopause. Having read this book, you can be the
local expert — it’s up to you to coach other women through this!

ost of us don’t want to just live through menopause, we want to dance
through it and keep dancing for another 40 or 50 years. Healthy bones
keep your get-up-and-go from turning into sit-down-and-wait — or worse —
fall-down-and-call-for-help.
Osteoporosis literally means “porous bone.” It’s a disease in which your bones
become thin and fragile and more likely to break. In fact, bones can become
so fragile that they’re crushed by their own weight. When the grocery clerk
throws apples on top of the soft bread in your grocery bag, the bread
becomes smashed and deformed from the weight of the apples. A similar
thing happens when your bones in your back press on each other — you 
lose height.
If you’ve seen women, maybe your own mother and grandmothers, shrinking,
developing a stoop, or being treated for fractures, you begin to understand
the toll that losing bone can take on your health, your longevity, and your
ability to remain independent as you age. In this chapter we’ll tell you how to
lower your risk of developing osteoporosis by building healthy bones before
menopause and making some healthy choices in your lifestyle after
menopause. Knowledge and prevention can keep you dancing.

Homing In on Bone Health
Knowing how your body makes bones and what it takes to keep them healthy
is a good place to start when outlining the relationship between the change
and the health of your bones. Your bones don’t quit growing after you
become an adult. They’re alive and changing throughout your life.
Growing big bones and strong bones
When you’re a kid, it’s obvious that your bones are growing. As your bones
get longer, you get taller. But your bones don’t just grow longer; they also get
thicker — denser. The denser the bone, the harder it is to break. Think of
your dinnerware. Those thick earthenware plates are much more difficult to
break than the fragile, translucent, fine china found in expensive restaurants.
People with strong bones have dense bones. Your bones continue to increase
in density until you’re about 30 years old, at which age you reach peak bone
density. If you start building strong, dense bones when you’re young, the
effects of bone loss in midlife are less problematic. The higher your peak
bone density, the better chance you have of keeping your bones healthy.
If illness, surgery, or some other factor causes you to go through menopause
prematurely, your bones are at extra risk. Not only are you subject to bone
loss at an earlier age and for a longer period of time than women who enter
menopause in their 40s or 50s, but — depending on the age at which you go
through menopause — your bones may never reach peak bone density
before you begin to lose bone mass. It will be especially important for you to
follow the advice in this chapter and work with your doctor to monitor your
bone density and stay up to date on advances in bone care.
In general, human males tend to be bigger than females; men also tend to
have denser bones than women. On average, African-American women have
denser bones than Caucasian and Asian women. This is why men and African-
American women generally have less trouble with osteoporosis than
Caucasian and Asian women.
Understanding peak bone density
Peak bone density is the maximum amount of bone that you’ll ever have. Most
people reach their peak by about age 30. Maximizing your peak bone density
is important because, after 35, you lose more bone than you build.
56
Part II: The Effects of Menopause on Your Body and Mind 

Your peak bone density depends on a number of factors such as genetics,
diet, and exercise. You can’t control the genes that control the size of your
frame and your ability to produce bone. But you can control your diet, get
plenty of calcium, vitamin D, and magnesium, and exercise early in life so that
you maximize your peak bone density. Using alcohol only in moderation and
not smoking also helps you reach a high peak bone density.
Keeping Pace with Bone Reconstruction
Even after you grow to your full height, your bones keep gaining and losing
bone material. Your body’s maintenance process, called remodeling, keeps
your bones strong and healthy day in and day out. Hormones help regulate
the maintenance process. So you can imagine that as your hormones change,
it messes up the bone maintenance process. (Check out the “Remodeling
your house of bones” sidebar earlier in this chapter for the ins and outs of
57
Chapter 5: The Business of Your Bones
Remodeling your house of bones
To better understand osteoporosis, it helps to
look at how bone is “built.” Each bone contains
cells that build bone (osteoblasts) and cells that
clear away bone (osteoclasts). Just as in home
remodeling, one crew comes in to knock down
walls, after which another crew comes in to
build the new room. Even medical professionals
refer to the bone-growing process as “remod-
eling” because this life-long process fixes wear
and tear caused by everyday living.
At some point, a section of bone is selected as
a remodeling site. Scientists don’t fully under-
stand how this happens, but at least some of
this takes place as daily wear and tear — and,
yes, exercise — bring on minute microfrac-
tures. This kind of wear actually gives your body
a chance to make itself stronger through
rebuilding. Osteoclasts remove bone by dis-
solving it with acid, which creates a cavity. This
process of breaking down bone is referred to as
bone resorption. What happens to the dissolved
bone? The body is an efficient recycler — the
calcium and other minerals that made up the
bone pass into the bloodstream and are used by
other parts of the body. In fact, whenever your
body needs extra calcium, the osteoclasts get
busy dissolving more bone. That’s why it’s
important to keep the body well supplied with
calcium so your osteoclasts don’t cannibalize
your bones for calcium.
After the osteoclasts have done their thing, the
osteoblasts get to work building new bone by
spreading a gel-like substance in the cavity.
Over the course of a month, this gel hardens
into bone. The bone-remodeling project takes
about two to three months. That’s probably
quicker than your last home-remodeling project,
but it’s a slower healing process than those
associated with other tissues such as muscle or
skin.

bone remodeling.) During your first 30 years on this planet, bone building
exceeds bone destruction in the remodeling process, and your bones stay
nice and healthy. After the big 3-0 or thereabouts, the teardown crew stays
active, but the builders have a harder time keeping up.
Making the calcium connection
Calcium is the central figure in the bone story. Your body needs calcium to
build bones and to keep every cell in your body in shape. Calcium helps mus-
cles contract, nerves respond, and blood clot. Bones store the calcium your
body uses until they release the calcium to a part of the body that requests it.
Findings from the Women’s Health Initiative study give calcium a thumbs up.
Calcium and vitamin D supplements were found to help preserve bone mass.
Calcium and vitamin D also serve to protect against hip fractures, especially in
older women. These supplements weren’t shown to be significantly effective at
preventing other types of fractures. Still, taking these supplements is easy and
inexpensive, so there’s no reason not to add them to your regimen. A slight
increase in the risk of kidney stones is the only risk detected. Table 5-1 lists
calcium requirements by age. As your bones grow larger, your body needs
more calcium. Your calcium requirements level off during your reproductive
years but increase after menopause. The reason — estrogen helps your body
absorb the calcium in your food. What happens to the calcium that’s not
absorbed? It goes out with the trash (other waste products). So to get the
same amount of calcium into your bones, you have to take in more calcium.

You may think that keeping your bones building and rebuilding is simply a
matter of getting enough calcium, and you’d be partly right, but a number of
vitamins and hormones help your body digest and absorb calcium. These vit-
amins and hormones have to be working right for the calcium in your diet to
get incorporated into your bones (see the “Nutrition” section later in this
chapter). The calcium must be digested and absorbed by your body to help
your bones and other tissues that need it.
58
Part II: The Effects of Menopause on Your Body and Mind 

If the calcium in your blood drops below a certain level, your parathyroid
glands, which monitor the amount of calcium in your blood, send the
parathyroid hormone out into the bloodstream to deliver the following mes-
sages to your kidneys and to your osteoclasts:
 Your kidneys get a message: “Save the calcium, don’t put it in the urine!”
In response, your helpful kidneys start activating the vitamin D they’ve
been storing so you can better absorb the calcium you eat.
 Your osteoclasts (the destruction crew) get a message, too: “Start mining
calcium from the bones to beef up supplies in the bloodstream.”
Your body cannibalizes its own bone to supply calcium to other cells if it
doesn’t get enough calcium or vitamin D. As a result, you suffer bone loss.
This can happen, for instance, when you’re pregnant or nursing. If your body
decides there’s not enough calcium in your blood for two, it will place a take-
out order for more calcium to be pulled from your bones so the baby’s needs
can be met.
There are two ways to resolve this problem: Either get more calcium in your
diet or slow down the remodeling process so that the builders can keep up
with the destruction crew. You can get more calcium into your system by
taking supplements, and exercising promotes remodeling. To slow down the
destruction crew, you need medication (see the “Treating Osteoporosis” sec-
tion later on).

Chapter 5: The Business of Your Bones
Losing ground inside and outside your bones
Osteopenia is a condition in which bone density
shows some decline, but not enough to cause
fractures. Left untreated, osteopenia can lead
to osteoporosis, a disease characterized by
weak, porous, and brittle bones.
Doctors actually group osteoporosis into three
types. Type 1, called “postmenopausal osteo-
porosis,” describes bone loss, linked to the fail-
ure of estrogen production. The loss occurs
mostly on the inside of your bones (you might
hear your doctor call it trabecular bone).
Fractures of the vertebrae and hip are typical of
Type I osteoporosis.
Type II osteoporosis affects people over 65 —
men as well as women. Time is the big culprit
here: It’s just been a lot of years since your 30s,
when your bones were in their prime. In Type II
osteoporosis there’s excess cortical bone 
loss — from the outside of the bone. These folks
can also have hip and spine fractures, but
pelvic, shin, wrist, and arm fractures are also
common, as is the “dowager’s hump.” 
Type III ospteoporosis is sometimes called sec-
ondary osteoporosis because it’s secondary to
(caused by) some other factor, such as hyper-
thyroidism (excess thyroid hormone), alco-
holism, a bone tumor, surgical menopause, and
some medications taken on a long-term basis,
including the anticoagulant drug heparin and
anticonvulsant meds.

Recognizing the role of sex hormones
Sex hormones also play a big role in helping your body absorb the calcium
you eat and manage the remodeling process. Hormone imbalance caused by
estrogen deficits affects your bones.
Estrogen helps absorb the calcium and magnesium you eat and deposits it
properly into your skeleton to give you strong bones. Estrogen also has a
calming effect on bone destruction and lets the bone builders stay more or
less caught up with the bone destroyers. As your estrogen supply dwindles
during menopause, the bone destroyers get more active. What’s more, you
aren’t able to digest as much of the calcium and magnesium you get from
your food as your estrogen supply declines. If your eating habits don’t
change, the old amount of calcium and magnesium won’t go nearly as far in
helping to build bone. That’s why most women add calcium and magnesium
supplements to their diet after menopause.
Some of the other sex hormones that help in the bone building process
include progesterone and testosterone, both of which your ovaries produce:
 Testosterone is actually a better bone builder than progesterone. It not
only triggers the osteoblasts to build bone, but it also helps them build
stronger bones.
 Progesterone helps the bone builders repair bone, but only if estrogen is
also present.
The slowdown of estrogen and testosterone production is another one of the
reasons the bone builders have a hard time keeping up with the destruction
crew after menopause.
So, sex hormones are an important player in the osteoporosis game because
they regulate bone remodeling. If you let the bone destroyers get too rowdy
and don’t force the bone builders to keep up with them, bone deteriorates
and becomes less dense.
Boning Up on Osteoporosis
The real danger of osteoporosis is that it sets the stage for literally breaking 
a leg (or a hip, or a wrist, or another bone). As you age, breaking a bone
becomes more than an inconvenience — it can be deadly. A hip fracture car-
ries the same mortality rate as breast cancer in the elderly! And half of hip-
fracture victims become dependent on caregivers for the rest of their lives.
60
Part II: The Effects of Menopause on Your Body and Mind 

Linking osteoporosis and women
First, the bad news about osteoporosis and women: About 25 million
Americans have osteoporosis, and most of them are women. The good news
is that the disease is preventable and treatable, even after menopause.
Women lose bone at very different rates, so the following generalizations
reflect averages for the perimenopausal (premenopausal), menopausal, and
postmenopausal years and don’t necessarily apply to every woman:
 Perimenopause: Most women begin losing bone from their spine before
or during perimenopause at a rate of 1 percent per year. 
 Menopause: After a woman becomes menopausal, the rate of bone loss
increases to about 3 percent per year if she doesn’t receive hormone
therapy.
 Postmenopause: Sometime during the ten years following menopause,
bone loss slows back down to a rate of about 1 percent per year.
In the first five to seven years following menopause, a woman can lose as
much as 20 percent of the total bone she’s expected to lose during her life-
time. By the time a woman is in her 80s, she may have lost as much as 47 per-
cent of her total bone density. If you think skeletons are scary, imagine losing
almost half of yours!
There is some good news, though: Only 25 to 33 percent of women develop
osteoporosis. However, it’s like a thunderstorm. You may only have a 33 per-
cent chance of rain, but if it’s your picnic that gets rained on, you’re gonna
get wet.
Defining and diagnosing osteoporosis
Osteoporosis literally means porous bone — bone that is weak and brittle.
Too little calcium in the bone is the cause of this disease. Both men and
women can develop osteoporosis, but it’s more common in women than men
for a couple of reasons:
 Women’s bones are less dense than men’s bones.
 Testosterone stimulates bone growth and helps build stronger bones.
Men have more testosterone than women.
 More women live further into their senior years than men.
61
Chapter 5: The Business of Your Bones

In your grandmother’s day, doctors only diagnosed patients as having osteo-
porosis if they actually broke a bone because of the disease. Today, technol-
ogy exists that can help identify osteoporosis before it results in painful and
often debilitating fractures. We baby boomers are definitely into prevention.
How does a healthy bone differ from a fragile bone? Imagine cutting the bone
in half so you can see it in cross section (as we illustrate in Figure 5-1).
 A healthy bone looks like Swiss cheese — lots of cheese separated by
small holes.
 A fragile bone looks like lace — lots of holes separated by thin, string-
like structures.
Osteoporosis today is defined in terms of how your bone density compares
with the peak bone density of a healthy, 35-year-old woman, (which serves as
the basis for the Young Adult category in Table 5-2):
 If your bones are just slightly less dense than the bones of an average
35-year-old, the diagnosis is osteopenia — low bone density.
 If they’re significantly less dense than the bones of an average 35-year-
old, the diagnosis is osteoporosis — brittle bones. Table 5-2 shows the
National Osteoporosis Foundation’s criteria used to diagnose osteoporo-
sis as of 1998.

The threshold that separates osteopenia from full-blown osteoporosis comes
from research that shows how much bone you can lose before significantly
increasing your risk of fracture. Folks with osteoporosis have low bone den-
sity, but they also have a higher risk of fracturing a bone.
Looking at causes
Sixty years ago, doctors noticed that osteoporosis occurred primarily in
menopausal women. They suspected that osteoporosis was related to sex
hormones — specifically to estrogen deficiency. Hundreds of research grants
later, medical professionals and ordinary folks know that estrogen levels
affect bone density.
Does menopause cause osteoporosis? The short answer is no. Osteoporosis
is caused by calcium deficiency in the bones, and estrogen plays a role in get-
ting calcium to your bones and keeping bones healthy. (Check out the
“Making the calcium connection” section earlier in this chapter for more on
calcium’s role.)
Deficiencies of other vitamins, minerals, and hormones can influence the
amount of calcium that gets absorbed by your bone, thereby contributing to
the development of osteoporosis. Lack of exercise can promote osteoporosis
as well. Finally, lifestyle choices, such as the use of tobacco and excess alco-
hol, can also play a role in the onset of osteoporosis.
Avoiding the effects
Osteoporosis weakens every bone in your body, leaving them prone to break-
ing. The bones most likely to break include the spine, hip, and wrist bones.
Breaking your wrist may inconvenience you for a few weeks or months. Hip
fractures are much more debilitating. Crushed vertebrae, so often associated
with osteoporosis, can cause you to become shorter. Crushed vertebrae can
leave you with a stooped appearance, too.
63
Chapter 5: The Business of Your Bones

Here’s how fractures of different bones occur and how they might affect your
functioning:
 Spinal fractures: Osteoporotic fractures of the spine are called compres-
sions. The weight of your body crushes, or compresses, the round body
of the vertebra, which provides these fractures with their name, com-
pression fractures. Compression fractures in your spine can leave you
stooped with what appears to be a hump in your back (called a dowa-
ger’s hump).
Between 5 and 15 percent of 50-year-old women get compression frac-
tures in their spine (as in osteoporosis in general, Caucasian and Asian
women are at greater risk than Hispanic or African-American women).
By age 70, that number grows to between 40 and 55 percent. (It depends
on whose research you’re looking at.) Often, these crushed or wedged
vertebrae cause little or no pain. You simply begin to notice poor pos-
ture that you can’t correct by standing up as straight as you can.
You may notice the first sign of crushed vertebrae during your annual
medical exam. After age 40 or 45 your doctor starts measuring your
height. Women with crushed or wedged vertebrae are often shorter than
they were before. If you find yourself getting shorter, the measurement
may not be a mistake — it could be a sign of osteoporosis. Figure 5-2
shows the possible changes in your spine that accompany osteoporosis.

Part II: The Effects of Menopause on Your Body and Mind 

Most women experience little or no pain when the vertebrae collapse,
which is both the good news and the bad. Nobody wants to be in pain,
but the lack of a clear signal that your spine is in trouble means it could
be months or years before the damage is detected and addressed. Some
compression fractures do cause pain, but it’s usually mild and can be
controlled by using an over-the-counter painkiller such as ibuprofen or
aspirin. The pain rarely lasts more than a few months. If you suspect
compression fractures, though, don’t try to take them on by yourself.
Work with your doctor to determine the extent of the problem and the
best course of action.
 Hip fractures: This problem is generally the result of a fall that breaks
the femur, the long bone of the thigh that connects your knee to your
hip. This break often occurs at the head of the femur where it connects
to the hip socket. In some cases, however, it’s the other way around: The
fragile bone simply breaks, causing a fall.
More than 90 percent of hip fractures occur in people over 70. So even
though osteoporosis can begin during perimenopause, it can be cor-
rected or held at bay so that you don’t experience the debilitating
aspects of the disease — the fractures. But don’t underestimate the
trauma of experiencing a broken hip at age 70. Only one-third of all
women who have hip fractures regain the functionality they had prior to
the fracture. Another third wind up in nursing homes. And unfortunately,
about 20 percent die of complications within a year of the fracture.
 Wrist fractures: Wrist fractures are common. When you fall, your first
reaction is to catch yourself by sticking your hands out in front of you.
You don’t have to guess why wrist fractures are common in women with
osteoporosis.
65
Chapter 5: The Business of Your Bones
Your hip bone’s connected to . . . your molars?
Menopausal bone loss can have a devastating
impact on your dental health as well as on your
spine and hips. The loss of bone mass in the jaw
is common in older women (and men), and can
lead to tooth loss when the bone that holds your
teeth in place is weakened. As with so many
health problems, dental bone loss is lowest in
people who have never been smokers, and
highest in long-time smokers who haven’t quit.

Preventing Osteoporosis by Managing
Your Risk Factors
Your risk of developing osteoporosis is higher than your risk of getting
breast, ovarian, or uterine cancer combined. After your 50th birthday, your
risk of developing osteoporosis grows. Forty percent of women over 50 will
sustain a fracture due to osteoporosis in her lifetime. Again, the risk for
Caucasian women is nearly twice as high as the fracture rate for African-
American women. So, the next time you’re sitting in a Mother’s Club meeting,
look to one side. Depending on your ethnicity, it’s likely that either you or the
friend next to you will break a bone because of osteoporosis.
Some women develop osteoporosis as they age, and others don’t. It’s impor-
tant to understand why this happens and how to be one of the women who
doesn’t fall victim to this disease.
If you’re a young woman, you can start preventing osteoporosis today. If
you’re over 35, finding out how healthy your bones are right now is a good
place to start. In either case, prevention and treatment are easier if you
understand how your bones stay healthy, how osteoporosis develops, and
why your risk of developing brittle bones increases after menopause. (Check
out the preceding “Keeping Pace with Bone Reconstruction” section.) Risk
factors vary by age. From childhood through your 20s, you can lower your
risk of osteoporosis by getting enough calcium, vitamins, and minerals; by
exercising; and by avoiding unhealthy activities such as smoking and drink-
ing too much alcohol. (We discuss exercise in Chapters 19 and 23.)
If you have children (whether they’re toddlers or young adults), they can begin
taking measures right away to prevent this disease. The stronger your bones are
early in life, the more you have to work with as you grow older. Having really
dense bones when your bone density peaks (when you’re about 30) gives you
more bone to work with during and after menopause. Young people can develop
strong bones by eating properly and staying fit (see Chapters 18 and 19).
After your 30s are in your rearview mirror and you begin to go through peri-
menopause and menopause, menopausal-related shifts in sex hormones and
other factors increase your risk of osteoporosis. (Check out the “Recognizing
the role of sex hormones” section earlier in this chapter for more on the con-
nection between osteoporosis and these hormones.) Risk factors boil down
to three basic categories:
 Genetic factors and family background
 Personal health history
 Your lifestyle
We devote a subsection to each of these topics.
66
Part II: The Effects of Menopause on Your Body and Mind 

Blaming your genes: Genetic factors
and family background
Your genes establish a lot of the rules concerning how your body develops
and how it ages. So it’s no surprise that genetics plays a role in increasing or
reducing your risk of osteoporosis.
Caucasian and Asian women have higher risks of osteoporosis than women of
African ancestry, particularly during perimenopause and the early years of
menopause. African Americans have a 6 percent lifetime risk of osteoporosis,
but Caucasian and Asian women each have a lifetime risk of about 14 percent.
The lower incidence of osteoporosis in African-American women is probably
due to the fact that African-American women have higher peak bone densities
than Caucasian and Asian women. Even though everyone loses bone with
age, African-American women have the advantage of having stronger bones
from the start.
Body build
Large-boned people generally build more bone than small-framed people, and
they often start out with more bone mass when they hit their bone-building
peak. As they age, large-boned people draw from a larger supply of calcium,
so bone deterioration takes longer. But large-boned people aren’t completely
safe; they get osteoporosis too. Small-boned, or petite, women have lower
peak bone densities, so they have less bone to lose.
Family history of osteoporosis
Medical folks have found that daughters of osteoporosis sufferers tend to
have lower peak bone density than normal for their age. Genes help deter-
mine our ability to make bone, and some women just don’t make as much
bone even with a proper diet and exercise.
Reviewing your personal health history
A number of aspects of your personal history influence your risk of osteo-
porosis, including menstrual and menopause-related issues and the medica-
tions that you take.
Menstruation
Because estrogen prevents bone loss, the more estrogen you produce during
your lifetime, the less your risk of osteoporosis. Not surprisingly, many fac-
tors relating to your periods affect how much estrogen you produce and,
therefore, your risk for osteoporosis. Check out the following:
67
Chapter 5: The Business of Your Bones

 Age at your first period: After you begin menstruation, your body pro-
duces more estrogen. Most girls begin to menstruate sometime between
the ages of 111⁄2 and 13. If you get your period early, you may produce
more estrogen in your lifetime than the average woman. With the addi-
tional estrogen, your bones may have a higher peak bone density than
the average woman. Of course, this assumes that you followed a proper
diet and got appropriate amounts of exercise. If you start out with
higher bone density, you can lower your risk for osteoporosis.
 Age at the onset of menopause: Most women go through menopause
between the ages of 45 and 55. Women who go through menopause ear-
lier begin losing bone earlier than women who start the change later in
life. This is particularly true if you go through premature menopause in
your 20s or 30s because of ovarian loss or failure linked to surgery, med-
ications, illness, or other variables. Women who have their ovaries
removed before age 35 often develop osteoporosis even with hormone
therapy. Women who have their uterus removed (hysterectomy) can go
through menopause two years earlier than other women. The earlier
onset probably results from cutting off some of the bloodflow to the
ovaries. The earlier onset of menopause increases your risk of osteo-
porosis a bit because you have fewer years of estrogen production.
Your body produces much less estrogen after menopause than it did
during your reproductive years, and the more estrogen you produce in
your lifetime, the lower your risk of osteoporosis.
Eating disorders
Anorexia and bulimia (along with over-exercising) can lead to low estrogen
levels, which can cause you to skip periods and your body to begin losing
more bone than it builds. Losing more bone than your body builds leads to
osteoporosis. These conditions also rob you of bone-friendly nutrients.
Medications
Some medications affect peak bone density, raising your risk of osteoporosis.
Ask your physician or read the literature that accompanies the medications
to determine if you’re at risk of bone loss from using a specific medication.
Some of the medications that can affect your bones include
 Corticosteriods used to treat chronic conditions such as asthma,
rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-
ease (COPD) can cause bone loss. These drugs increase bone loss by
inhibiting calcium absorption. Women who take corticosteroid dosages
greater than 5 milligrams for more than two months increase their risk
of bone loss. Sometimes, physicians prescribe Fosamax, a drug that
slows down bone destruction and encourages bone building, along with
certain steroids if long-term steroid use is necessary.
68
Part II: The Effects of Menopause on Your Body and Mind 

 Excessively high dosages of thyroid-replacement medication or an over-
active thyroid (as with Grave’s disease) can decrease bone strength.
Excess thyroid hormone causes bone loss.
 Some of the medications used to treat endometriosis and breast cancer
contribute to rapid bone loss.
 Certain types of diuretics used to treat heart disease or high blood pres-
sure cause the body to excrete more calcium. When used for prolonged
periods of time, they can raise your risk of bone loss. Thiazide diuretics,
on the other hand, actually reduce the amount of calcium excreted in
the urine. They also seem to inhibit bone breakdown.
Surgeries
Certain surgeries can increase your risk of osteoporosis because they impact
your body’s ability to absorb or digest calcium or the vitamins and minerals
needed to get calcium from your diet into the bone. These surgeries include
 Gastrectomy: Removal of all or part of the stomach. This surgery
impacts your ability to digest calcium and other nutrients needed to
build bone.
 Intestinal bypass: Surgery to remove a portion of your intestine. This
surgery impacts your ability to absorb calcium and other nutrients
needed to build bone. Gastric bypass weight-loss procedures can have
the same effect for the same reason.
 Thyroidectomy: Surgery to remove part or all of the thyroid gland. If
your thyroid is removed, you must take thyroid-hormone medication.
Too much thyroid-replacement medication triggers excessive bone loss
and a decrease in bone strength.
Looking to your lifestyle
Now we come to the section about lifestyle issues, most of which you have
some control over. You can’t do much about your age (even if you claim to be
39 years old for the rest of your life, your body knows the truth). But you can
take steps to lower your risk of osteoporosis by picking up some new healthy
habits and eliminating the unhealthy habits.
Age
From the time you’re born until you’re about 30, your main job is to build the
strongest skeleton you can by following a healthful diet, exercising regularly,
and avoiding tobacco and alcohol. After you reach your 30s, your body loses
bone faster than it makes it.
69
Chapter 5: The Business of Your Bones

By the time you’re 70, you’ve probably lost about as much bone as you’re
going to, but other aspects of aging increase your risk of falling and breaking
a bone. By 70 or 80, your body has lost much of its flexibility, you may have
less balance, your eyesight and depth perception may be poor, and you may
be taking medications that affect bone loss or physical conditioning.
Smoking
Smoking is clearly associated with compromised bone health. It accelerates
bone loss, contributes to the development of osteoporosis, and — in the
event that you do break a bone — impairs healing. Smokers have a 41 percent
higher incidence of hip fractures than non-smokers do. The dangers are
greatest for long-time smokers, but even if you haven’t smoked for very long,
you will take longer to heal if you break a bone. The good news is that it’s
never too late to quit and see improvement. If you don’t smoke, don’t start. If
you do, this gives you another good reason to quit.
Alcohol use
More than three drinks a day is considered excessive as far as raising your
risk of osteoporosis. Excessive alcohol consumption decreases bone density.
Moderate drinking, however, actually appears to have a protective effect. If
you don’t drink, don’t start just to give your bones a buzz. If you have an
evening glass of wine, though, it looks like you may be helping your bones.
Exercise
Exercise is the kindest gift you can give your bones after you give them cal-
cium. It’s critical to building strong bones. Exercise puts stress on your
bones, which is a good thing as far as bone density is concerned. Stress
forces the bone tissue to absorb calcium and promotes remodeling; there-
fore, it gets stronger. Exercise also stimulates the muscles around the bone so
that the muscles get stronger and provide more support for your bones.
Exercise also can help decrease your chances of falling and having a fracture
by training your muscles to respond quickly to a trip or accident.
Exercise during childhood and early adulthood is important in preventing
osteoporosis because it helps your bones achieve their full potential
strength. Later in life, exercise helps your bones continue to absorb calcium
so that they stay strong.
Add 30 to 40 minutes of weight-bearing exercise to your routine most days of
the week. Exercises that emphasize core strength (focusing on your core —
back and abdominal — muscles) and balance are especially helpful and can
help prevent falls. Try tai chi, yoga, Pilates, or working out with a balance
ball. Swimming, although one of the best exercises for your overall muscle
strength, heart and lungs, and stamina, doesn’t do much for your bones
(because the water does all the work holding you up).
70
Part II: The Effects of Menopause on Your Body and Mind 

Although physical activity helps protect your body against osteoporosis, too
much strenuous activity can lead to low levels of estrogen. Unless you’re
training for the Olympics, you probably aren’t exercising too strenuously.
Skipping periods can be a sign that you’re over-exercising.
Nutrition
Calcium helps your body build bone. But calcium does much more than the
TV advertisements proclaim. Calcium is also fundamental to regulating your
sleep and moods and to proper muscle function.
Dairy products are the best source of calcium as far as food goes. A variety of
vegetables also contain calcium, but vegetables contain less calcium per
serving than dairy products. The fiber in vegetables makes it harder for your
body to extract and use the calcium in them — strange, but true.
Are soft drinks getting the best of you? Drinking carbonated soft drinks every
day can zap the calcium out of your foods and supplements before it ever
gets into your system. The phosphates in the soda bind with the calcium and
magnesium, making them unusable. If you drink sodas regularly, try to stop
or cut back on them, or increase your consumption of calcium. Doctors rec-
ommend menopausal women get 1,200 milligrams of calcium every day after
age 50 (check with Table 5-1).
Many women find it easier to use calcium supplements than to get all the cal-
cium they need from dairy products. With supplements, you know exactly
how much calcium you’re getting each day and most have the appropriate
amounts of two other nutrients critical to bone building — vitamin D and
magnesium. When choosing a supplement, avoid those made from oyster
shell and dolomite. These supplements can be contaminated with toxic
heavy metals. Calcium-carbonate antacids are one of the cheapest and easi-
est calcium supplements to find. As long as the calcium-carbonate antacid
has no aluminum, it’s safe to take every day. We personally prefer a calcium
supplement that also contains vitamin D and magnesium, two other nutrients
critical to healthy bone maintenance.
Women should get 400 to 600 milligrams of vitamin D and magnesium every
day to maintain healthy bones. In other words, you should have about half as
much vitamin D and magnesium every day as calcium. Magnesium prevents
bone loss by playing an active role in bone growth. It also supports nerve cell
communication (preventing wild mood swings), helps regulate blood pres-
sure, and aids in muscle contraction. The last two functions help prevent
heart attacks. The heart is essentially one big muscle so magnesium helps
keep the contractions regular. Also, magnesium seems to prevent spasms of
the blood vessels, particularly in the arteries around the heart.
71
Chapter 5: The Business of Your Bones

Calcium supplements with magnesium help prevent the constipation that
some women experience when they take calcium supplements. Magnesium is
a natural laxative and one of the main ingredients in milk of magnesia.
Dividing your daily dose of calcium into two parts (say, 500 mg with breakfast
and another 500 mg with dinner) also seems to help.
Vitamin K helps keep the body from cannibalizing bone for calcium by main-
taining proper levels of calcium in the blood. Vitamin K also produces a pro-
tein used to build bone called osteocalcin. You can get vitamin K in green,
leafy vegetables such as spinach and broccoli. You should get at least 100
micrograms of vitamin K a day. (Half a cup of broccoli has about 150 micro-
grams of vitamin K.)
Take your calcium faithfully every day. Findings from the Women’s Health
Initiative show that women who did so had 29 percent fewer hip fractures.
Women who were more haphazard about their calcium supplements had only
marginally fewer hip fractures than women who didn’t take them at all.
Caffeine
Women who drink four or more cups of coffee a day increase their risk of
fractures due to osteoporosis. Caffeine promotes bone loss by increasing the
amount of calcium in your urine. Because coffee has more caffeine than most
teas or colas, curbing your coffee habit is one of the best ways to reduce
your caffeine intake in the quest for healthier bones. If you just can’t get that
coffee monkey off your back, at least drink a cup of milk for each cup of
coffee you drink. You can also switch to decaffeinated beverages.
Foods to watch
You know about the vast array of diets and dieting products available today
to help you lose weight. Be aware that high-protein foods and diets may not
be good for your bones. Acids are sent into the bloodstream to help digest
the protein, and your body hits the bone up for calcium to neutralize these
acids. This leads to bone loss.
Women who eat a lot of red meat each week (5 servings or more) increase
their risk of fractures by 20 percent. Proteins from vegetables, grains, and fish
don’t seem to cause the same responses as proteins from meats. 
Lactose intolerant? Good sources of dietary calcium that won’t give you the
collywobbles include yogurt; some hard cheeses; leafy, green vegetables such
as broccoli, spinach, and kale; and fish canned with the bones left in, such as
sardines and salmon. The many foods now available that have been enriched
with calcium are helpful if you’re no longer friends with milk: look for juices,
breads, and cereals with added calcium.
72
Part II: The Effects of Menopause on Your Body and Mind 

Sunshine
Soaking up some rays can actually help your bones soak up the calcium.
Vitamin D is crucial to your body’s ability to absorb calcium, and sunshine
helps your body make vitamin D. Don’t overdo it, though — this advice isn’t a
free pass to spend hours at the beach courting wrinkles and melanoma. As
little as 15 minutes of sunlight a day can help without turning you into a
crispy critter. Work in your garden, take a walk, or read the paper on your
sunny porch. 
Finding Out Whether You 
Have Osteoporosis
Unfortunately, most women find out they have low bone density only after
they’ve had a fracture. Other women first notice it in the mirror — their pos-
ture seems poor, even when they stand up as straight as they can. Still other
women have a chest x-ray for some unrelated reason and the doctor notices
crushed vertebrae, indicating brittle bones.
Among women 45 to 75, 75 percent have never asked their healthcare
provider about osteoporosis. And many doctors don’t think to bring it up
unless you’re being treated for a fracture. Start the ball rolling by asking your
doctor about whether you need a bone mineral density (BMD) test. Having a
test sometime around your 40th birthday gives you a baseline — that is, a
sort of “before” picture your doctor can use in coming years to compare with
new tests to help determine whether you’re losing bone. These baseline tests
often measure bone in your spin and your hip, but may also include one or
both of your wrists.
Because “official” recommendations, such as those from the U.S. Preventative
Services Task Force, recommend that all women have their first bone density
test after they turn 65, you may have a tough time convincing your insurance
company to cover the cost of this test if you haven’t yet reached this age. If
you have one or more risk factors for osteoporosis, though, it may be possi-
ble to persuade the insurance company to pony up. Bone-density tests can
help your doctor answer three important questions:
1. How much bone, if any, have you lost?
2. How quickly are you losing bone?
3. What’s the best therapy to get your bones healthier and keep you from
losing more bone?
73
Chapter 5: The Business of Your Bones

The bone-density test produces a graphic image of your bone as well as sta-
tistics that compare your bones to healthy bones. You can find out how
quickly you’re losing bone by having these tests repeated every two or three
years. The results of your bone-density test will guide your physician in
choosing an appropriate therapy for bone loss, if one is needed.
Doing the DEXA
To measure bone density, most physicians use a test called a dual energy x-
ray absorptiometry, or DEXA for short, which uses a fraction of the radiation a
chest x-ray uses.
74
Part II: The Effects of Menopause on Your Body and Mind 
Reading a DEXA report
The first thing you’ll notice on the DEXA bone-
density report is the colorful graphic image of
your hip or spine. The report you receive looks
almost like an x-ray except it displays colors
that correspond to different bone densities.
Typically, a legend shows the color gradient
going from low-density bone to high-density
bone. This allows you to see exactly where the
low-density areas are.
Statistics that compare your bone mineral den-
sity (BMD) measurements to the average den-
sity derived from BMD readings of a large
number of 35-year-olds are displayed next to the
image. When they compare your bone density
to this “standard,” the difference is represented
as a percentage. In other words, if your bones
were half as dense as the average 35-year-
old’s, your statistics would read 50 percent; if
your bones were the same, it would read 100
percent.
Suppose your comparison shows that your
bones are within 85 percent of those of a 35-
year-old. Is this terrible, or is it terrific? To deter-
mine if this percentage is statistically significant
(something worth treating), the report also
includes a T-score and a z-score. For those of
you who weaseled your way out of taking sta-
tistics, T-scores show how much your score dif-
fers from “normal.” In this case, normal, or +1, is
the score of a healthy 35-year-old woman of
your ethnic background. Negative T-scores
aren’t so good. A T-score of –1, (1 standard devi-
ation below normal) isn’t too bad (unless you
have already experienced unexplained frac-
tures). Your doctor will probably diagnose you
with osteopenia, which means you have low
bone density (see Table 5-2 for the criteria used
in diagnosing osteoporosis). If your T-score is
2.5 standard deviations below normal, or lower,
your doctor will probably diagnose you as
having osteoporosis and recommend a course
of treatment or some kind of dietary/fitness
intervention.
Your test will also give you a z-score. This is sim-
ilar to your T-score except this test compares
your bone density to that of other women of
your age, weight, and ethnicity.

Preparing an image of your hip only takes a few minutes, and preparing an
image of your spine only takes a few minutes more. The technician can see
the results immediately, although you often receive your report a few days
later. (They don’t want the insurance company to think that the procedure
isn’t worth the money.)
The report shows colored images of your spine and hip reflecting different
bone densities. The statistics that accompany the images compare your bone
density to that of the average 35-year-old woman and to women your own
age. (See the “Reading a DEXA report” sidebar nearby.)
If you’re at high risk for osteoporosis due to genetics or life events (such as
premature menopause), have your initial bone-density test during your early
30s, and have subsequent tests every two years after that.
Opting for another type of test
The DEXA bone-density measurement is probably the most commonly used
procedure, but you or your doctor may opt for another procedure. Several
devices work on the same principle as the DEXA bone scanner, including:
 Dual photon absorptiometry (DPA): Introduced in the early 1980s, DPA
was one of the first devices that could measure bone density in areas
covered by heavy muscle, such as the spine and hip — the best bones to
use as predictors of total body bone density. This machine is a bit
slower and less precise than DEXA and can’t measure small changes, so
using it for comparisons is more difficult.
 Quantitative computed tomography (QTC): Also known as CAT scans or
CT scans, QTCs can measure bone density anywhere in the body. The
advantage of this procedure over the others is that it can accurately
measure the center of each vertebra in the spine. DEXA measurement
can only measure a certain type of vertebrae because other bones are in
the way.
CAT scans aren’t typically used to measure a patient’s bone density on a
yearly basis because it exposes the patient to more radiation than the
other techniques — and they’re pretty expensive.
 Ultrasound: This test is sometimes used to measure bone density in the
heel or kneecap. These machines are portable, so theoretically, more
people can be screened using this quick, inexpensive bone-screening
procedure. On the down side, this machine is limited to measuring bone
density in peripheral sites — places other than the preferred spine and
hip sites. If an ultrasound detects low bone density, you should have a
follow-up DEXA test.
75
Chapter 5: The Business of Your Bones

 Urine tests: As bone dissolves, some of the byproducts show up in
urine. When performed every few months, urine tests can tell whether
bone loss is increasing or decreasing. This test isn’t an accurate diagnos-
tic instrument for osteoporosis because you can have low bone density
but be losing bone slowly. The test is generally used with patients on a
treatment program for osteoporosis to monitor progress.
X-rays are not used to test for bone density because changes in the “white-
ness” of the bone on the x-ray can’t be detected until you’ve lost 30 percent
of your normal bone mass. Clearly you want to take some action before you
lose 30 percent of your bone mass.
Treating Osteoporosis
The first step in reducing bone loss is eliminating unhealthy habits (smoking
and excessive alcohol use, for example) and picking up healthy habits (such
as a healthful diet and an exercise program). Even simple treatment mea-
sures, such as calcium supplements and increased exercise, can slow bone
loss and improve bone density.
More aggressive treatment programs include medications and/or hormone
therapies. These programs can slow and even reverse bone loss. Many physi-
cians recommend that women at high risk of osteoporosis begin hormone
therapy during menopause. Estrogen levels need to be at least half of the
level that they are during a normal menstrual cycle to prevent bone loss.
Some women who have lost a significant amount of bone may have testos-
terone added to their hormone regimen. Hormone therapy should be started
early in menopause in addition to the other treatment programs. We’ll talk
more about hormone therapy and bone loss management in Chapter 16.
Battling bone loss with medication
There are several classes of prescription medications that help prevent or
repair the damage done by osteoporosis. Because they may have side effects
and risks of their own, you will need to work closely with your doctor to
decide whether medication — and which one — is right for you. Even if you
take medication to keep your bones healthy, you will still need to supplement
your diet with calcium and vitamin D, exercise, and follow other bone-
protecting health guidelines.
76
Part II: The Effects of Menopause on Your Body and Mind 

Using hormones 
In 1991, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Department of
Health, and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute launched the
Women’s Health Initiative (WHI), a group of long-term studies of health issues
in the lives of more than 160,000 postmenopausal women. 
Estrogen-alone therapy and bone health
One of these researchers looked at the effect of estrogen-alone (without prog-
estin) hormone replacement on bone health.
For such a long study, the findings that relate to the estrogen-alone study are
short — and not particularly sweet. This type of therapy was associated with
decreases in the risk of hip fracture in post-menopausal women. This protec-
tion came at a steep price, though: women taking the estrogen also suffered a
significant rise in the risk of stroke. In fact, the risk was so great that the WHI
voluntarily suspended the estrogen-only trials before the eight-year follow-up
period was over. The FDA currently advises that estrogen-alone therapy
should be used for as brief a time as possible, and in the smallest effective
dose, to control menopausal symptoms, and should not be prescribed just
for the prevention of disease, including osteoporosis.
77
Chapter 5: The Business of Your Bones
Examining the link between 
bone density and diabetes
Type I diabetes has long been associated with
low bone density, though the reasons are still
poorly understood. Because Type 1 diabetes
tends to be diagnosed relatively early in life,
however, one factor seems to be that diabetes
develops before bone density has had an oppor-
tunity to peak. 
People with Type II diabetes often actually have
better-than average bone density, but recent
research shows that a surprising number are
prone to osteoporotic fractures. It may be that,
because this type of diabetes is associated with
obesity and a more sedentary lifestyle, as well
as with nerve damage that impairs sensitivity in
the feet, falls may simply occur more often,
leading to osteoporotic fractures. 
The incidence of both diabetes and osteoporo-
sis are increasing as longevity increases, and
the complex factors at work here need more
study. In the meantime, follow medical advice
consistent with managing both conditions: exer-
cise and eat right. Make sure you talk with your
doctor about how these conditions might be
related, and how treatment for either disease
might have an impact on your experience with
the other.

Estrogen plus progestin therapy and bone health
Women taking estrogen and progestin together also got a good news/bad
news message from the WHI about HT and osteoporosis. Postmenopausal
women taking this combination therapy had 24 percent fewer fractures of any
kind, and a one-third reduction in hip fractures compared with women taking
a placebo (a fake pill with no active medical ingredients). Not only that, but
hip bone density actually increased in this group by a small percentage: about
3.7 percent after three years. But this study, too, was stopped early. In the
case of the combination HT study, the increased risk of breast cancer was the
main concern. Again, the FDA recommends against the use of HT just to pre-
vent osteoporosis because of this increased breast cancer risk.
Does this mean that HT is universally bad for all women? No, of course not.
Every woman’s case is different, and you’ll need to take your own experi-
ences, feelings, and history into account when working with your doctor to
decide what’s right for you. But the findings from the WHI studies at least
give us a good place to start.

In This Chapter
 Uncovering estrogen’s connection to cardiovascular disease
 Getting the goods on “good” and “bad” cholesterol
 Understanding cardiovascular diseases
 Laying out the risk factors for cardiovascular disease
 Preventing cardiovascular conditions
W
omen usually don’t have heart trouble until after they reach
menopause, at an average age of 51, and your risk for cardiovascular
disease increases after menopause because you lose the protective benefits
of estrogen. Plus, if a woman has a heart attack during mid-life, she’s more
likely than a man to die from it. Why? One reason is that women have differ-
ent symptoms than men. The crushing chest pains that warn men of a heart
attack aren’t as common in women when they experience a heart attack. 
Uncertainty about whether your symptoms signal a potentially serious heart
problem can lead to delays in seeking treatment. So be sure to check out the
section, “Holding off heart attacks,” later in this chapter to review the warn-
ing signs of a heart attack for women, one of the many heart-healthy tips you
can find in this chapter.
In this chapter, we discuss heart attacks and many other types of cardiovas-
cular disease that can affect your health during and after menopause. But
you can keep your heart healthy even after menopause. And what would this
chapter be if we just covered the bad news? We also discuss ways to keep
your heart happy after the change — adopting a heart-healthy diet, getting a
bit of exercise, and eliminating some bad habits.

Keeping Up with All Things Cardio
Okay, we’re not discussing the latest craze in cardio workouts (although
Chapter 19 gives you some great ideas on fitness!); instead, in this section, we
bring to light how your heart and blood vessels work so you can better
understand both the role estrogen plays in your cardiovascular system as
well as the connection between menopause and your cardiovascular health.
In its simplest form, your cardiovascular system consists of your blood vessels
and that big pumping muscle you know as your heart. As seen in Figure 6-1,
blood carries oxygen to the heart and picks up garbage on the way back.
Revealing estradiol’s role in heart health
Estrogen (in particular, the active form, estradiol) does a lot to keep your
blood vessels and heart healthy and free from disease. The following list of
ways estradiol protects you from getting an achy-breaky heart pulls together
all the studies that have been done on estradiol and the cardiovascular
system:
 Estradiol lowers your blood pressure by dilating blood vessels.
 Estradiol increases the good cholesterol and lowers the bad.
 Estradiol keeps platelets (part of your blood) from clotting too quickly.
 Estradiol acts as an antioxidant to keep fat deposits from forming on the
walls of your arteries.
 Estradiol facilitates the release of a chemical that relaxes blood vessels,
which helps reduce vessel spasms and increase blood flow.
Linking cardiovascular disease 
and the menopausal woman
Estrogen, the female hormone produced in the ovaries, is good for your
heart. Estradiol, the active form of estrogen, is the most beneficial form of
estrogen, but (you guessed it) it’s also the type of estrogen that decreases as
you become menopausal. (Chapter 2 is full of information about what your
hormones do — check it out.)
Basically, estradiol is our secret weapon against all kinds of cardiovascular
diseases. It’s what every man wishes he had so that he could avoid the early
onset of heart problems. (See the section, “Revealing estradiol’s role in heart
health,” earlier in this chapter.)
80
Part II: The Effects of Menopause on Your Body and Mind 

You may have heard that before age 50, women are about half as likely as
men their age to have heart disease. This statement has led many people to
perceive heart disease as largely a male problem. It isn’t. Men do tend to
develop heart problems about ten years earlier than women — so on aver-
age, a woman has the heart of a man ten years her junior. But just because
men develop heart disease at an earlier age doesn’t mean that heart disease
isn’t deadly for women. Just as many women as men die of heart disease
each year.
Cardiovascular disease (disease of the heart and blood vessels) increases in
women as estradiol levels decrease. After menopause, your risk of cardiovas-
cular disease shoots way up. Between 45 and 65 years of age, men experience
three times more heart attacks than women. But after age 65, watch out —
women have more heart attacks than men.
We want to give you the total picture here, and unfortunately, that includes
some info you may not want to hear. Of all the ways a menopausal woman
can pass into the hereafter, cardiovascular disease is the most likely culprit.
In fact, after menopause, you’re ten times more likely to die from cardiovas-
cular disease than from breast cancer.

Chapter 6: Getting a Handle on Heart Health

For some reason, the word hasn’t gotten out to women or their doctors.
Heart disease kills more women each year than lung, breast, and colorectal
cancers combined. Also, diagnoses of heart disease and heart attacks are
often delayed in women because the symptoms aren’t recognized and taken
seriously. See the section, “Holding off heart attacks,” later in this chapter for
more information on symptoms.
The term cardiovascular disease (CVD) encompasses conditions that affect
your heart and blood vessels such as heart disease, heart attack, high blood
pressure, coronary-artery disease, and stroke. All these diseases restrict the
flow of blood to the heart or brain.
Considering Cholesterol
You probably hear a lot about cholesterol — from your doctor, and from com-
mercials for cholesterol medications. And you’re not getting forgetful when
you begin to think the cholesterol goals your doctor sets for you get lower
and lower. The more doctors learn about the dangers cholesterol plays in our
health, the more they encourage you to avoid it. 
Lowering your cholesterol isn’t the only important factor in keeping your
heart healthy, but it definitely plays a strong supporting role.
At its basic level, cholesterol is fat — waxy, yellowish, oily fat. However, this
fat (also known as a lipid in med speak) is critical to keeping your well-oiled
body running. Your body uses cholesterol to build and repair cells and to
produce hormones, such as estrogen and testosterone, vitamin D, bile (used
to absorb fat), and myelin (coats the nerves). If your blood contains too
much cholesterol, the cholesterol gets deposited with other crud on the
inside of your blood vessels. Cholesterol travels through your bloodstream
on the back of proteins, so the particles are named lipoproteins (get it? —
lipid plus protein equals lipoprotein). Lipoproteins with more protein than fat
are called high-density lipids (HDL), and those with more fat than protein are
called low-density lipids (LDL). By the time you’re menopausal, your LDL
levels have risen and often exceed those of men your age.
Breaking down the types of cholesterol
Not too long ago doctors thought that the most important cholesterol
number to look at was the ratio of your total cholesterol to your HDL, or
good cholesterol. Now groups such as the American Heart Association and
others recommend looking instead at your individual cholesterol numbers.
Lucky you, you have four of these, one for each aspect of your cholesterol: 
82
Part II: The Effects of Menopause on Your Body and Mind 

 High-density lipids (HDLs): These lipids are called the “good” choles-
terol because they help prevent the buildup of plaque. Because HDLs are
mostly protein with just a little bit of fat, they can carry the extra bad
cholesterol back to the liver so that the body can (literally) flush it away.
 Low-density lipids (LDLs): Also known as the “bad” cholesterol, LDLs
are mostly fat and only a small amount of protein. At normal levels, they
carry cholesterol from the liver to other parts of the body where it’s
needed for cell repair. When LDL cholesterol is too high, it adheres to
the walls of the arteries and attracts other substances. The combined
glob is called plaque.
 Triglycerides: In addition to the fat known as cholesterol, your blood
contains this other type of fat in small quantities. Triglycerides have
very little protein. They’re almost pure fat, and the body uses them to
store energy.
 Total cholesterol: This isn’t literally another type of cholesterol. The
term refers to a measure of the total amount of cholesterol in your blood.
To help separate the good cholesterol from the bad stuff in your mind, just
remember Lousy DeaL: Low-density lipids (LDLs) are the “bad” cholesterol
behind plaque formation.
You really don’t need to eat any cholesterol after the age of one because your
liver produces enough cholesterol on its own. Animal products such as meat,
eggs, and dairy foods are especially high in cholesterol. Even though people
don’t need to eat these types of food to get enough cholesterol, most folks
enjoy meat, cheese, birthday cake (which is full of butter and eggs), and
other good stuff packed with cholesterol.
To find out the shape your blood is in, your doctor checks your cholesterol
and triglyceride levels by taking a blood sample. The results, a cholesterol
profile or a lipoprotein analysis, include your LDL, HDL, total cholesterol, and
triglyceride levels. Using this information, your doctor can identify problems
with your lipids and evaluate your risk of atherosclerosis.
Decoding your numbers
The more we know about cholesterol, the more complex our cholesterol
reports get. Once upon a time we just got numbers that told us whether our
good and bad cholesterol were good, borderline, or bad. It’s not so simple
any more. Each of those four cholesterol numbers we mentioned before pre-
sents a whole range of possibilities. In the case of some of them (total choles-
terol, for instance) lower is better. In others (HDL — remember, that’s your
good cholesterol), a higher number is more favorable. Here’s how to decipher
your report:
83
Chapter 6: Getting a Handle on Heart Health

 Total cholesterol, roughly speaking, is considered to be good if it’s
under 200, bad if it’s over 240, and marginal or borderline if it’s some-
where in between. Your doctor may help you set a more specific individ-
ual goal, though, if you’re at high risk for heart disease based on weight,
lifestyle, or family history. In such a case you may be advised to get far
less than 100.
 HDL (good cholesterol) tends to be higher in women than in men,
though it often drops after menopause. Recent recommendations put
good HDL ranges at 60 or more, marginal HDL between 41 and 59, and
worrisome HDL levels at about 40 or below.
 LDL, or bad cholesterol, has even more specific ranges. Optimal is less
than 100, but anything between 100 and 129 is probably fine. Numbers
between 130 and 159 are considered borderline high, 160 to 189 is high,
and anything over that means you need to work with your doctor,
pronto, to get your bad cholesterol down to a safer level.
 Triglycerides have their own numbers, too: less than 150 is normal; 151
to 199 is borderline; high is 200 to 499; and any triglyceride level charted
at 500 or above is considered very high.
Looking at the factors
We all know that you are what you eat, but diet isn’t the only thing that con-
trols your blood cholesterol. Exercise, insulin, obesity, and age also influence
cholesterol levels.
Your genes probably have the biggest influence on your cholesterol profile.
Your mother, for example, might nibble on salads, avoid desserts, and banish
butter from her plate. Despite her low-fat eating habits, your mother’s choles-
terol profile could actually be worse than your dad’s — even if he loves to eat
cholesterol-intensive grilled cheese sandwiches and enjoys milk shakes with
his grandchildren (when he’s not snacking on a cream-of-something soup). It
may not seem fair, but it happens. Genes are powerful things. (Want to read
more on the respective roles of genes and diets in controlling your choles-
terol? Check out Controlling Cholesterol for Dummies by Carol Ann Rinzler and
Martin W. Graf., M.D. [Wiley]) 
Regulating estrogen’s role
Estradiol (the active type of estrogen) plays a major role in the way lipids are
produced, managed, broken down, and eliminated from the body. Estradiol
also seems to help dilate the blood vessels and keep them from having
spasms. This may be part of the reason that women are prone to cardiovas-
cular problems after menopause.
84
Part II: The Effects of Menopause on Your Body and Mind 

Natural estradiol is one thing, but hormone therapy is another when it comes
to protecting your cardiovascular system. Take a look at Chapter 11 for more
details on this subject, but here’s the most recent word on hormones and
your heart. Fair warning — it’s a little bit surprising.
First, we know that estrogen increases the level of good cholesterol (HDL) in
the blood, and lowers the level of bad (LDL) cholesterol. We also know that
lowering bad cholesterol and raising good cholesterol is generally associated
with better heart health. 
But new findings on the effects of hormone therapy on heart disease and
women seem to contradict this. In fact, the study found two surprising things.
First, women in the study taking estrogen and progestin were 29 percent
more likely to have a heart attack, and twice as likely to have a stroke than
women taking a placebo, or mock drug. Furthermore, women taking estrogen
alone received no significant heart benefits from taking estrogen therapy.
The bottom line on heart health and hormones hasn’t been written yet.
Women from both groups — estrogen alone and estrogen plus progestin —
will continue to be followed up for a number of years. During this time,
researchers will try to figure out this apparent contradiction. We’ll talk more
in Chapter 11 and in Chapter 16 about how to figure out what this means for
you as you make your own decisions about hormone therapy.
Connecting the dots between cholesterol
and cardiovascular disease
If your artery walls are injured (as a result of smoking, cocaine-use, diabetes, or
other factors), your body may react too aggressively in repairing the walls.
White blood cells come to the rescue and bring cholesterol with them to patch
over the damaged area. After a while, other stuff adheres to the spot and this
patch becomes harder, similar to a callus. This harder stuff is called plaque.
This is how bad habits or disease can lead to hardening of the arteries — what
your doctor refers to as atherosclerosis.
Sometimes people have way too much LDL cholesterol and not enough HDL
to carry it out of their bloodstream. When this happens, LDL cholesterol gets
deposited on the artery walls and rots. (Antioxidants can prevent the rotting,
which is one reason that nutritionists tell folks to get plenty of antioxidants if
they want to be good to their hearts.) Other substances then collect with the
rotting cholesterol to form plaque. This is how high cholesterol can lead to
hardening of the arteries.
Antioxidants are substances, such as vitamins A, C, E, or beta-carotene, that
protect cells from damaging oxidation, which appears to encourage aging and
certain diseases.
85
Chapter 6: Getting a Handle on Heart Health

The latter process is a lot like the buildup that causes the drains in your
kitchen sink to clog. Garbage goes down your sink every day, and every day,
a little bit of gunk gets stuck on your pipes. Pretty soon the gunk buildup
slows down the water as it moves through the pipes.
With time, calcium begins to form on the plaque, hardening the arteries. Now
your arteries are narrowed and hardened, and blood has a hard time flowing
to the heart. Just as the water backs up in your sink because of the clog, the
blood backs up in your arteries when they become stopped up. Narrowing
arteries can force your heart to pump harder to get the blood around your
body. When your blood needs more pressure than normal, you have hyperten-
sion (high blood pressure).
Sometimes the plaque in your artery breaks off and gets lodged in a blood
vessel, as shown in Figure 6-2. Imagine pouring clog-busting chemicals down
your drain; except instead of dissolving the clog, the chemicals just loosen
the gunk. Then the chunk o’ gunk gets stuck in the curve of the pipe. When a
piece of plaque gets stuck in a blood vessel, the area of heart muscle that
gets fed by that vessel dies, and you have a heart attack.

Understanding Cardiovascular Diseases
A whole family of diseases affects your cardiovascular system, and a lot of
inbreeding goes on in this family. For example, high cholesterol can lead to
hardening of the arteries. Hardening of the arteries can lead to heart attack
or stroke as well as angina. Hypertension can lead to heart attack or stroke. It
goes round and round and your risk of all these conditions increases as your
natural estrogen levels decline after menopause.
In this section, we introduce you to the members of the cardiovascular-dis-
ease family. Don’t worry, we talk about preventing and treating unexpected
visits from these conditions, too.
Containing coronary artery disease
Coronary artery disease (CAD) affects the blood vessels (the coronary
arteries) that supply blood to your heart muscle. If these vessels are dam-
aged, or if you have too much cholesterol in your blood, coronary arteries
become narrowed or blocked by plaque as cholesterol and calcium build up
inside them. This process is called hardening of the arteries, or atherosclero-
sis. When the heart doesn’t get enough oxygenated blood because of partially
or totally blocked arteries, your heart muscle pays the price. The result is
coronary heart disease. Coronary heart disease may cause angina (chest pain
that we talk about in the “Avoiding angina” section later in this chapter) or a
heart attack (check out the “Holding off heart attacks” section also found
later in this chapter). Here’s a depressing factoid: Nearly a million women in
the United States develop coronary heart disease during the course of a year.
Women often underestimate the severity of their chest pains or don’t realize
that the chest pains are related to heart problems; therefore, they play down
the symptoms to their physician. A couple of the reasons women give for not
seeking help immediately are that they didn’t want to inconvenience anyone
and that they thought that heart disease was a guy thing.
Avoiding angina
To function properly, the heart muscle needs a constant supply of oxygen and
nutrients delivered by the blood. If your veins or arteries become narrowed
by fatty buildup in the artery walls (atherosclerosis), you may experience
severe chest pain called angina. You feel pain because insufficient amounts of
blood are getting through your veins into your heart muscle, and your heart is
straining to pump enough blood to keep your body going strong.
87
Chapter 6: Getting a Handle on Heart Health

Angina can also be caused by spasms in the blood vessels that block blood
flow to the heart. Spasms can occur even if no blockages are present. Women
are much more likely than men to suffer angina with no evidence of blockages.
Symptoms sometimes begin during physical activity or emotional stress.
They typically last about ten minutes and go away after several minutes of
rest. But many women experience chest pain while they’re resting. This is
typically triggered by spasms or an arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat).
Pay attention to warning signs. As a woman, you may not feel the typical
crushing, squeezing, heaviness, or burning chest pain that many men feel
prior to a heart attack. Instead you may experience one or more of the 
following symptoms:
 Back pain
 Bloating
 Chest pain while resting
 Fatigue
 Heartburn or abdominal pain
 Jaw pain
 Joint pain
 Lightheadedness/fainting
 Shortness of breath
 Sweating
Attention all women! Angina is a very common early warning sign of coronary
artery disease (CAD). Because CAD is so lethal in women, heart specialists
typically schedule further tests right away for women with severe chest
pains. (For more on coronary artery disease, check out the “Containing 
coronary artery disease” section earlier in this chapter.)
Unfortunately, a survey studying how emergency-room doctors treated
patients with severe chest pain showed that men received much more 
aggressive and quicker treatment than women did. Also, men were twice 
as likely as women to be sent for coronary arteriography (a special test that
looks at the coronary arteries) and bypass surgery after complaining of chest
pain. If you go to the emergency room with chest pain or anything else that
could be symptoms of a heart attack, insist — or make sure whoever accom-
panies you insists — that a heart attack be taken into serious consideration
as a possible cause.

Part II: The Effects of Menopause on Your Body and Mind 

Holding off heart attacks
Menopausal and postmenopausal women are at an increased risk of heart
attack (myocardial infarction in medicalese). Most women experience heart
attacks after age 60, but heart disease may begin as early as the preteen
years. Cholesterol accumulations have been found in girls as young as ten
years old. These accumulations in young children, called fatty streaks, some-
times turn into more significant buildup later in life.
Blocked arteries often cause heart attacks. Either plaque breaks loose or a
blood clot (a mass of solidified blood) blocks an artery cutting off blood
supply to the heart. If the blockage remains in place for 5 to 10 minutes or
more, the piece of the heart muscle fed by that artery begins to die.
Vessel spasms and arrhythmia are two additional causes of heart attacks, and
evidence suggests that they’re more common triggers of heart attack in
women than in men. Spasms constrict your coronary arteries so blood can’t
get to the heart. Spasms can also cause plaque to break away from the vessel
and get lodged in an artery, cutting off blood supply that way. Arrhythmia, or
an irregular heartbeat, can mess up the pumping action of the heart and cut
off blood supply as well.
Women often have different symptoms before a heart attack than men do.
The symptoms are easy to overlook because they’re often subtle and typical
of many other, less serious problems. Often, women look back and say, “Oh
yeah, now that you mention it, I felt that way yesterday,” after the heart
attack has already occurred.
An unfortunate byproduct of a heart attack is a condition called ventricular
fibrillation. Ventricular fibrillation refers to an irregular heartbeat that hap-
pens when the main pumping chambers of the heart, the ventricles, can’t get
coordinated; therefore, the blood can’t get to the far reaches of the body.
African-American women are at one-third greater risk of heart attack than are
Caucasian women, probably because of their increased level of risk for two
prominent risk factors for heart attack: diabetes and hypertension. If you’re
African-American, be especially vigilant about living a heart-healthy lifestyle
and monitoring your cholesterol and blood sugar.
Fending off hypertension
High blood pressure is another one of those health issues that’s more likely
to pop up as you get older. Until age 55, women usually have lower blood
pressure than men. Between 55 and 65 years of age, women and men are
about equal in the incidence of high blood pressure. After 65, more women
than men have high blood pressure. So, just when you’re dealing with all the
symptoms connected with menopause, you may develop high blood pressure
(your doctor may call it hypertension).
89
Chapter 6: Getting a Handle on Heart Health

About half of all Caucasian women and three-quarters of African-American
women over 50 have hypertension. For some reason, African-American
women are more prone to hypertension than Caucasian women. Mexican-
American women have about as high a chance of having hypertension as
Caucasians, but Cuban-American and Puerto Rican women have lower inci-
dence of hypertension.
No one knows why people develop high blood pressure. About 5 percent of
the time, high blood pressure is caused by a condition such as diabetes or
pregnancy, and it often goes away with treatment or resolution of the precipi-
tating condition.
To visualize high blood pressure, think of blowing up a balloon. As you hold
the balloon opening to your mouth and blow, the air in your mouth is under a
great deal of pressure because you’re trying to pass it through the small
opening in the balloon. Now, think of your heart as your cheeks and your
arteries as the balloon opening — the smaller the balloon opening, the more
pressure in your cheeks as you try to blow. So, if your blood vessels get
smaller due to cholesterol buildup, or whatever, your heart has to pump
harder to pass the blood through these narrower openings. The result: Your
blood pressure rises.
High blood pressure can lead to heart attack, kidney damage, bleeding in the
retina behind your eyes, and stroke. For these reasons, having your blood
pressure checked routinely after you reach 40 (or at any age) is critical.
Many women develop high blood pressure because of obesity. Fortunately,
these women often can reduce their blood pressure dramatically by switch-
ing to a heart-healthy diet (see Chapter 18) and losing weight.
If you’re not overweight, you may need to try some other types of interven-
tion. Some women are able to regulate their blood pressure by reducing anxi-
ety through meditation or other relaxation techniques. If these techniques
don’t work, medication may be the answer to getting your blood pressure
under control. You may have to work with your doctor to find just the right
type of drug and dosage. One drug may work for others but not for you. And,
for some reason, drugs used to control blood pressure are more effective in
men than women.
Staving off stroke
A stroke can occur for one of two reasons: either a blood clot blocks the flow
of blood to your brain or a blood vessel in your brain ruptures. In either case,
oxygen-rich blood can’t get to the brain to nourish it. The problems a stroke
causes depend on the location and severity of the stroke, but speech prob-
lems, physical weakness, paralysis, and permanent brain damage are all pos-
sible stroke complications. Many stroke victims go through rehabilitation
programs that restore full or partial function to the affected areas of the body.
90
Part II: The Effects of Menopause on Your Body and Mind 

Here are the symptoms associated with strokes:
 Difficulty talking or understanding speech
 Dizziness
 Loss of vision, particularly in just one eye
 Unexplained numbness or weakness in the face, an arm, a leg, or one
side of your body
A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is like a mini-stroke. During a TIA, blood flow
to the brain is interrupted (usually by a blood clot). The symptoms of a TIA
usually last only 10 to 20 minutes and end when blood flow returns to
normal. At worst, the symptoms of a TIA last 24 hours; symptoms of a stroke
can last a lifetime. Pay attention to TIAs because they can be early warning
signs of an impending stroke. Half the people who have a TIA suffer a stroke
within a year.
If you have any of the symptoms listed in conjunction with the stroke discus-
sion, call your doctor or 9-1-1 immediately. Seeking immediate treatment for
stroke is critical to your best chances of a full recovery.
Checking Out Your Risk Factors 
for Cardiovascular Disease
Many of the risk factors for complications related to cardiovascular disease
are more risky for women (particularly menopausal women) than men, but
many are risk factors for both men and women — even men and women who
seem to be in good health:
 Alcohol: Women don’t produce as much of a specific enzyme used to
break down alcohol (alcohol dehydrogenase) as men do. So women tend
to feel the buzz from alcohol earlier than men, and alcohol stays in their
systems longer. Three or four drinks a day will cause a noticeable rise in
blood pressure. (We outline the dangers of high blood pressure in the
earlier “Fending off hypertension” section.) In large doses, alcohol acts
as a poison and kills heart tissue.
 Cholesterol: Low HDL levels and a high LDL-to-HDL ratio increase a
woman’s risk for cardiovascular disease. After menopause, most
women’s HDL levels drop a little bit. A bigger change takes place in your
LDL level. As women age, LDL levels keep rising — especially between
the ages of 40 and 60. So your HDL and LDL levels and your LDL-to-HDL
ratio are usually worse as you age.
91
Chapter 6: Getting a Handle on Heart Health

 Cocaine use: Cocaine and its relative — crack — are seriously danger-
ous drugs. Cocaine, whether snorted, smoked, or injected, can cause
serious damage to women’s arteries and heart. Cocaine and crack use
can cause spasms in the coronary arteries, restrict oxygen flow to the
heart, and cause arrhythmia. If a woman has a previous coronary-related
condition such as a mitral valve prolapse (heart murmur), cocaine can
cause sudden death.
 Diabetes: High blood pressure, excessive weight, and inactivity can lead
to adult-onset diabetes in women. Although adult-onset diabetes isn’t real
common, it’s very serious for menopausal women. Diabetes can cause a
host of other problems, one of which is an increased risk of heart disease.
Here’s the scoop on women, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease:
• Women over 45 (menopausal women) are twice as likely as men
their age to develop diabetes.
• Women with diabetes are more than five times as likely to have
some type of coronary “event” (we’re not talking about a gala here;
we’re talking about a heart attack, angina, and so on) than women
without diabetes.
• Women with diabetes are four times more likely to die of a heart
attack. In fact, 80 percent of all people who suffer from diabetes die
of heart attacks
Fortunately, adult onset diabetes can often be prevented or controlled
through weight loss, exercise, and a healthy diet.
 Excessive weight: If you weigh 20 percent or more than your target
weight, you’re overweight. (Chapter 18 has a chart you can use to deter-
mine where you are in relation to your target weight.) For example, if
your target weight (how much people your height and build should
weigh) is 125, you’re overweight if you weigh 150 pounds or more.
Excessive weight increases your risk of high blood pressure, heart dis-
ease, stroke, and even diabetes. Because excessive weight leads to many
diseases and complications, it only makes sense that losing the exces-
sive weight can lower your risk for many diseases and complications.
Excessive weight is a huge and growing problem (no pun intended) —
more than one-third of all Caucasian women and half of all African-
American women in the United States are overweight.
 High blood pressure: High blood pressure can lead to heart attacks and
stroke because it stresses out the blood vessels. Stress on your blood
vessels can constrict the arteries and cause plaque to separate from the
vessel wall and clog your arteries.
Inactivity: For women, inactivity is the most common risk factor for 
cardiovascular disease. Most women never had the time or chance to
incorporate a “workout” into their busy schedules. Chauffeuring chil-
dren and performing household chores, intermingled with a 40- to 50-
hour workweek, often leaves women with no time or desire to take a
92
Part II: The Effects of Menopause on Your Body and Mind 

walk or regularly attend an exercise class. Husbands and children (aren’t
they precious?) may question how you can waste an hour on an activity
that doesn’t directly benefit them or the household. Well, the fact is that
you must make the time (just as your husband or kids do) for physical
activity. Physical activity is not a waste of time — it lowers a woman’s
risk of heart problems by a whopping 50 percent. And keep in mind that
half of all women die of cardiovascular disease. Take a look at Chapter
19 for some ideas on increasing your activity level.
 Personality: Many people believe that too much stress results in high
blood pressure and heart attacks. Whether you’re talking monkeys or
people, the research indicates that it’s a control thing, not a just a stress
thing. Women (and monkeys) who feel in control of their lives are much
less likely to have heart disease. Cholesterol profiles are also much
better for women who feel in control of their jobs, lives, or homes. When
you feel out of control, you’re more likely to feel cynical or hostile, or
you may feel sorry for yourself. Researchers have also linked these per-
sonality traits to a higher incidence of heart disease.
 Smoking: Cigarette smoking triples your risk of heart attack and angina.
Even women who smoke fewer than five cigarettes a day double their
risk of heart disease. When you inhale smoke, your heart beats faster,
your blood vessels constrict, and your circulation slows down. The nico-
tine in cigarettes promotes blood clots (which can lodge in your arteries
to cause heart attacks or stroke). Smokers also have a greater risk of
high blood pressure and emphysema. 
Being Smart about Your Heart
Eating a healthy diet, watching your weight, exercising routinely, avoiding
unhealthy habits, and getting annual medical examinations are the best ways
to prevent cardiovascular problems.
Weighing an ounce of prevention
Keeping your blood clean and lean really helps prevent hardening of the
arteries, which is the source of many serious problems. Controlling your cho-
lesterol boils down to eliminating unhealthy habits (smoking, drinking too
much alcohol, using recreational drugs, and so on), sticking to a healthy diet
(check out Chapter 18), and exercising five days a week for a half-hour (turn
to Chapter 19).
If you’re not able to control your cholesterol through lifestyle changes, you
and your doctor can consider alternatives. A variety of medications are avail-
able today that can lower your cholesterol.
93
Chapter 6: Getting a Handle on Heart Health

But many people develop hypertension even though their cholesterol levels
are terrific. Doctors always seem to check your blood pressure as soon as
you step in the door. So keep those doctor appointments and, if your blood
pressure is high, seek help. Your doctor will work with you to find the right
medication for you, but you’re the one who has to take it every day if it’s
going to work.
Routine checkups (that means at least once a year) with your internist and
gynecologist should prevent cardiovascular problems from sneaking up 
on you.
Treating what ails you
If you maintain regular appointments and seek help when you feel any weird
happenings in your heart (such as palpitations or pain), you should be pretty
safe. Of course, you have to follow the advice given to you by professionals
when problems are detected. If you have high blood pressure, you need to
take your medication. Even though you usually have no symptoms with hyper-
tension, not taking your medication can cause trouble — same goes for cho-
lesterol. Many people have no symptoms when their cholesterol is high, but if
they go untreated, faulty cholesterol levels can cause a world of problems.
Today, a variety of medications are available to treat these conditions.
Sometimes you and your doctor will have to experiment a bit to find out
which medicines work for you, but the effort is worth it because the reward
is a prolonged life.

I
f you think it’s difficult talking to your mom about menopause, envision
talking to her about the vaginal and urinary problems associated with the
change. Probably not going to happen? Join the club. Many women live with
discomfort because they’re too embarrassed to discuss these problems with
anyone — not even their doctors.
In this chapter, we open the discussion so you can not only understand the
potential vaginal and urinary issues you may encounter, but also so you can
feel free to discuss these problems openly with your doctor and get the treat-
ment you need.
Understanding the Normalcy of 
Vaginal and Urinary Changes
Someday, you may notice that your vagina doesn’t seem to be performing its
lubricating duties like it used to when you’re about to engage in sex. Or
maybe sex is becoming a bit uncomfortable. Your private parts may be dry,
and you may experience itching around your vulva or in your vagina, a
watery vaginal discharge, or a burning sensation when you pee. The medical
term for this is atrophic vaginitis, or vaginal atrophy in more common terms.

Vaginal and urinary issues are not unique to menopausal women — some
women experience vaginal dryness during sex long before they’re menopausal,
and other women who have been menopausal for several years have no prob-
lems with vaginal dryness. Some women experience vaginal irritation only tem-
porarily; others find it gets worse with age. It’s a very individual thing.
If you live long enough, without hormone therapy or some type of treatment,
your vaginal lining is going to thin and become drier, but you may never
experience any of the symptoms, pain, or discomfort. You may never even
know that it’s happening. Some women notice dryness during sex or itching
that lasts a few months while their bodies adjust to the lower estrogen levels.
Other women may experience discomfort during sex at first and then more
intense symptoms as time goes on. If you do experience discomfort, you
don’t have to simply put up with it — many treatments are available.
Your urinary tract and your female organs are located next to each other, and
both systems rely on estrogen to function properly. These two facts explain
why problems can arise in both systems during the change and why changes
in your vagina may affect your urinary tract.
Talking Shop with Your Doc
Before you can do anything about urinary-tract or vaginal problems, you
must have a doctor diagnose your condition. Many vaginal symptoms have
nothing to do with menopause, so seeing a medical expert is critical.
You may think that talking to your doctor about painful sex or problems with
your plumbing is embarrassing, but get over it. Your doctor has heard it all
before. Doctors are supposed to ask you about them, but if they don’t, you
should bring the issues up.
Here are some tips for talking to your doctor about your symptoms:
 Keep track: You need to plan ahead for your visit to the doctor. If you
experience vaginal or urinary-tract pain, keep track of when it hurts,
where it hurts, the presence or absence of discharge, the color of the dis-
charge, and any other details. If you experience urine leakage, write down
what time you urinated, how much urine was involved (use any measure
you’re comfortable with — cups, ounces, teaspoons, whatever — and let
the doctor do the conversion), and what triggered the accident. Also
note any type of discomfort and the level of pain.
 Be specific: When you discuss matters with your doctor, don’t just say that
you’re uncomfortable “down there” and then lift your eyebrows to make
your point. Tell the doc specifically what symptoms you’re experiencing.
96
Part II: The Effects of Menopause on Your Body and Mind 

 Be persistent: If the doctor’s response isn’t helpful — “That’s normal for
women your age” — press him on the issue to get the advice and help
you need to deal with the problem. Just because “it’s normal” doesn’t
mean that it can’t be helped.
Overcoming Vaginal Changes
Many women fear that the natural result of menopause is that their vagina
dries out, shrivels up, and becomes a sexual wasteland. Well, that doesn’t
have to happen. In fact, fewer than half of all postmenopausal women com-
plain of vaginal dryness or other symptoms of vaginal atrophy.
Who came up with the term vaginal atrophy? The term atrophy makes you
think of stagnant, dead things, doesn’t it? When we hear atrophy, we think of
those plump little worms that get stranded on a sidewalk after a rainstorm
and end up dried out and dead. Look up the word atrophy in the dictionary —
it means “wasting away” and “failure to grow because of lack of nutrition.” But
don’t worry — you have way more options than that poor little worm does.
Understanding what vaginal 
atrophy is and what it isn’t
We’re going to start by describing what vaginal atrophy is not. It’s not a con-
dition that occurs only in women after menopause, and it doesn’t mean your
vagina is going to shrivel up and blow away.
So what is vaginal atrophy? Glad you asked. Because estrogen keeps your
vagina moist and elastic, loss of estrogen can cause it to become drier, thin-
ner, and less elastic. The downturn in estrogen production can also cause
your vagina to shrink slightly in terms of width and length.
An atrophic vagina has lost some of its plumpness and firmness because the
lining has thinned, and it doesn’t have the furrows and folds typical of a fer-
tile vagina. (Yes, this is one case in which wrinkles are a sign of youth.) The
vagina appears red instead of pink. Also, with less mucous, the vagina
becomes less acidic, so it’s easier for bacteria to grow, which causes the
watery discharge some women experience.
Talk to your doctor about vaginal changes if you experience discomfort.
Dryness and other vaginal-atrophy-related symptoms may prompt you to
avoid sex just when you have more time for it. Don’t be embarrassed to bring
it up — your doctor knows of plenty of ways to fix this one.
97
Chapter 7: Dealing with Vaginal and Urinary Changes

Looking at what less estrogen 
means for your vagina
Estrogen bathes the vagina (and your urinary tract), keeping the tissue lubri-
cated and flexible. Estrogen is the secret behind keeping the female organs
working like a well-oiled machine.
Here’s what the relative lack of estrogen that menopause brings about can
mean to you:
 Your vagina becomes more susceptible to tears or damage from friction.
Sexually transmitted diseases have an easier time invading your body
through tears than through an intact lining. So, step up your protection
after menopause. Also, because tearing your vagina is easier after
menopause, watch the rough stuff.
 As vaginal tissues lose their elasticity, your vagina may become less pliant
and sometimes smaller. Sex may be less enjoyable if you don’t intervene
with some type of therapy to improve pliability and lubrication.
 Your vagina may not get as lubricated during sexual arousal as it did
before menopause, so intercourse may be painful if you don’t use a
lubricant.
 Vaginal mucous keeps your vagina an acidic kind of place. This acidic
environment destroys much of the bacteria introduced into the area
(through sex or wiping after you go to the bathroom). When your pro-
duction of vaginal mucous declines, infections find it easier to grow in
your vagina. After menopause, you become more susceptible to vaginal
bacteria, so you can develop bacterial vaginosis (inflammation of the
vagina caused by bacterial infection).
Doing something about vaginal atrophy
For some women, the easiest way to prevent or slow down the progress of
vaginal atrophy (and probably the most enjoyable one) is to practice regular
sexual activity. Sexual activity increases blood circulation and lubrication
and promotes vaginal elasticity. If you don’t have a sexual partner, masturba-
tion provides the same benefits.
If dryness inhibits your sexual desire, or makes you anxious or nervous about
sex, try one of the many lubricants available over the counter. Some of the lubri-
cants are for use during sexual activity; others act as moisturizers and cause
your vagina to absorb water. Some women also find that vitamin E relieves dry-
ness. Break open a capsule and apply the oil directly to your vagina. Even if you
use an over the counter product, though, you should still mention the problem
to your doctor, who may have better options to recommend.
98
Part II: The Effects of Menopause on Your Body and Mind 

Avoid any lubricants that contain mineral oil or ingredients that begin with
“petro.” These can promote bacterial infections, and can also damage
diaphragms and condoms.
Applying estrogen cream to the vagina also provides relief from the pain and
itching associated with vaginal dryness. Your best bet is to use these medica-
tions as prescribed by your physician. If you have a history of any condition
that prevents you from taking hormone therapy, be sure to discuss the use of
hormone-based vaginal creams with your doctor to make sure they’re safe 
for you. 
Vaginal estrogen creams seem more effective for relieving discomfort due to
dryness than oral hormone treatments. Although most of the estrogen stays in
your vagina, some is absorbed into your bloodstream. However, doctors usu-
ally prescribe such a low dosage for this problem that using a vaginal estrogen
cream shouldn’t substantially increase your risk of endometrial cancer or
breast cancer as oral estrogen does. In fact, vaginal creams are often pre-
scribed for women who don’t want to take hormones orally because they’re at
higher risk of endometrial or breast cancer. Still, there have been some
reports of increased breast development in men whose sexual partners use
estrogen creams, so we know they can get into your bloodstream (or his).
As with hormone therapy (HT) and estrogen pills, you need a prescription
from your doctor for these creams.
By the way, you can use a lubricant during sex in addition to the estrogen
cream to keep things slippery.
Before we change subjects, here’s one last tip: Drinking plenty of water keeps
your entire body hydrated, including your vagina. Think of yourself as an ath-
lete in training and follow an athlete’s regimen: Drink more water. Drink less
alcohol and coffee.
Talking about Urinary Problems
A healthy urinary tract depends on healthy tissue and toned muscle around
the plumbing. About 40 percent of women between the ages of 45 and 64
have urinary-tract problems, which mainly take the form of incontinence
(inability to hold back urine). You may never have a urinary-tract problem,
but if you do, you’ll know the basics because in this section, we arm you with
the information you need to know.
99
Chapter 7: Dealing with Vaginal and Urinary Changes

Getting a grip on types 
of urinary problems
Urinary-tract problems are no longer kept in the closet as they once were.
Everyday, it seems another famous actor appears on a TV commercial confess-
ing his or her problem. Many products are available to help control or elimi-
nate urinary disorders so that you can enjoy all the activities you’ve always
participated in. Ask you doctor about appropriate courses of treatment.
Your urinary tract moves liquid waste from your kidneys, through your blad-
der, and out to the toilet. For the most part, it consists of your kidneys, blad-
der, ureter (the duct that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder), and
urethra. But never mind the technicalities, the relevant fact is that urinary-
tract conditions are more common in women after menopause.
Bet you didn’t know this: The end of the urethra (the little tube that your
urine flows from) is more dependent on estrogen than any other part of your
urinary tract. After menopause, when estrogen has been low for a period of
time, that tube can become inflexible. Simultaneously, the collagen and con-
nective tissue (the fleshy stuff) around your urethra that supports your
plumbing gets thinner. So three problems can occur:
 With less flexibility and thinner tissue in and around your urethra,
you’re more likely to get some microscopic tearing that makes it easier
for bacteria to enter the urethra. Therefore, urinary-tract infections
(UTIs) can get started more easily.
 An overall decrease in your level of estrogen occurs at about the same
time that some women develop a painful and little-understood bladder
disease called interstitial cystitis.
 The urethra has a harder time sealing itself using pressure, so you may
leak or dribble urine when you least expect it and have instances of
incontinence.
Nearly one of every six women over 45 develops one of these urinary-tract
problems. So don’t feel embarrassed when you talk to your doctor. These
problems are quite common and very treatable. But infections only become
worse with time, so go to the doctor right away if you think you’ve got prob-
lems with your plumbing.
Take a look at the “Talking Shop with Your Doc” section earlier in this chapter
for recommendations on recording your symptoms in preparation for your
visit to the doctor. For urinary-tract problems, you can talk to either your
gynecologist or primary-care physician. Your doctor will refer you to a spe-
cialist if needed, but most of the time, a gynecologist or primary-care physi-
cian can handle these issues. We’re not here to diagnose your problems, but
100
Part II: The Effects of Menopause on Your Body and Mind 

in the following sections, we tell you a bit about each of these conditions and
what your doctor might do about them.
Tracking urinary-tract infections
A whole slew of urinary-tract infections (UTIs) are out there, and they can
affect areas of your bladder, kidneys, and so on. One thing all UTIs have in
common is that they’re mainly caused by bacteria entering your plumbing
from your urethra.
The most common UTI, cystitis, affects your bladder. Women are more prone
to bladder infections than men because we wipe after we use the toilet.
That’s right — just tidying up leads to problems. Wiping can sweep germs
from your feces (bowel movements) into your urethra. These bacteria (espe-
cially E. coli) can travel all the way to your bladder (or further into your kid-
neys) and create an infection. (That’s why you should always follow your
mother’s advice — wipe from front to back.) Your urethra is also shorter than
a man’s, making the trip to the bladder shorter and easier for bacteria.
Frequent or vigorous sex can harm the delicate tissue of the vulva and outer
urethra, which in turn allows bacteria into the body causing urinary-tract
infections. Peeing immediately after sex helps you avoid UTIs by flushing out
unfriendly bacteria.
Getting to a diagnosis
If you have a urinary-tract infection, it usually starts with a burning sensation
or pain when urinating accompanied by urgency, frequency, or both. (Urgency
refers to feeling as though your bladder is so full it’s about to burst and you
can’t make it to the bathroom. Frequency is that feeling that you have to go to
the bathroom constantly.)
If you have a UTI, you may find yourself rushing to the bathroom, releasing
just a trickle of urine, and then a short time later, feeling as if you have to go
again. This pattern is especially irritating at night. Repeatedly waking up to
shuffle off to the bathroom can leave you exhausted.
You may also notice that your urine is cloudy, has blood in it, or smells badly.
If the infection is in your kidneys, you may have a fever, chills, back pain,
nausea, or vomiting.
Urgency, frequency, and pain related to peeing are also symptoms of other
conditions. If you experience any or all of these symptoms, make an appoint-
ment with your medical advisor. You’ll have to do the pee-in-a-cup routine so
that the professionals can examine your urine to determine whether you
have a UTI or some other condition. The tests your doctor may run include
101
Chapter 7: Dealing with Vaginal and Urinary Changes

 Urinalysis: The doc examines the urine under a microscope for white
blood cells (which indicate an infection), bacteria, and so on.
 Urine culture: Your doctor sends your urine sample to a laboratory to
find out exactly what type of bacteria are present.
Trying some treatments
Treatment usually includes a short course of antibiotics and instructions to
drink plenty of fluids.
Drinking several glasses of unsweetened cranberry juice every day also helps
your recovery from a bladder infection. Cranberry juice makes urine more
acidic, thereby making it more difficult for bacteria to grow.
Don’t use cranberry juice as an alternative to visiting your doctor if you think
you may have a urinary-tract infection. Some dangerous conditions can
develop if a urinary tract is left untreated.
Covering interstitial cystitis
Interstitial cystitis (IC) is often overlooked or misdiagnosed as a urinary-tract
infection because the symptoms are so similar, but it’s actually a bladder dis-
ease. Interstitial cystitis is often called painful bladder syndrome (PBS)
because its symptoms include general pelvic pain or pressure.
IC is rare, yet nearly a million people suffer from it each year in the United
States, and 90 percent of these are women. It can occur in women who have
reached menopause, but some women also develop IC in their 20s or 30s.
Some medical professionals wonder aloud whether there’s a link between
hormones and IC. We’ve mentioned that tissues in the bladder and through-
out the urinary tract rely on estrogen. Well, the nerve-endings do too. When
estrogen bathes these nerve endings during your reproductive years, you
don’t notice any sensation in your bladder until it’s quite full because estro-
gen keeps your sensory threshold high. But, when your estrogen levels are
reduced during perimenopause and menopause, your pain threshold is low-
ered and you become more sensitive in your bladder area. Here are more
clues that suggest a possible role for hormones in connection with IC:
 The average age of an IC sufferer is 42.
 Premenopausal women who have IC seem to have recurrences during
the part of the menstrual cycle when estrogen levels are falling.
102
Part II: The Effects of Menopause on Your Body and Mind 

Getting to a diagnosis
If you have IC, your doctor won’t find any bacteria when he analyzes your
urine sample, even though the symptoms of IC are similar to those of a bacte-
rial bladder infection (frequent urination — especially at night — a sudden
urge to urinate, and pain that becomes worse as the bladder fills up).
Sometimes the pain, which can get very intense during urination, subsides
after urination. The symptoms may go away from time to time. It’s all quite
mysterious.
Sometimes the pain is pretty generalized and occupies your entire pelvic
area. You may feel pressure, tenderness, or pain in your bladder and the area
around your bladder. If you’re still menstruating, the pain may get worse just
before your periods. You may also have pain during intercourse.
Diagnosing IC isn’t easy. In their search for a cause of your symptoms, doc-
tors initially go through a process of elimination, testing for UTIs and other
conditions. After they eliminate these other possible causes, docs may take a
peak at your bladder by inserting a scope up through your urethra into your
bladder (this is called a cystoscopy, and though it’s about as much fun as it
sounds, you are given an anesthetic to help you through it) to look for scar-
ring or microscopic tears on the walls inside your bladder.
Trying some treatments
The treatment options range from the least invasive — modifying your diet —
to the most invasive — bladder surgery to repair the walls or remove the
entire bladder.
Some women find that eliminating certain foods from their diet helps relieve
bladder irritation. These foods include alcohol, coffee, tobacco, sharp
cheeses, artificial sweeteners, preservatives, and acidic foods. Dyes used in
food and medicines have also been found to irritate the bladder or cause
bladder spasms.
Between modifying your diet and having surgery, you may find success with
some medications: There are several medications in use for the treatment of
IC, including antidepressants, antihistamines, and mild analgesic narcotics
can manage the pain. Only one, Elmiron, has been approved just for IC; it has
been found to repair some of the damage on the bladder wall.
Antibiotics are ineffective in treating an IC. Women misdiagnosed with a 
urinary-tract infection find that the antibiotics prescribed for that condition
do little to help relieve the symptoms of IC.

Chapter 7: Dealing with Vaginal and Urinary Changes

Encountering incontinence
Three-year-olds have a hard time “holding it” when they don’t recognize the
signal telling them that they have to pee until it’s too late. Later in life (after
babies, surgery, and menopause) some women again have trouble “holding
it,” but for different reasons. Sometimes, your body doesn’t follow the orders
your brain calls out.
When you can’t hold back urine, or urine leaks out when you don’t want it to,
you may be incontinent. Lower levels of estrogen contribute to reduced
muscle tone in the urethra, so you can lose bladder control. Wear and tear on
muscles from bearing children or surgery can make the problem even worse.
The urethra (the tube through which urine flows from the bladder out of your
body) is controlled by having more pressure around the urethral tube than in
the bladder, keeping it closed. Estrogen helps increase muscle tone that leads
to increased pressure, which prevents leakage. With lower estrogen levels,
the muscle fibers lose their flexibility. The urethra has a hard time making a
nice tight seal where it connects to the bladder.
Getting to a diagnosis
Incontinence comes in a couple of varieties:
 Stress incontinence: Urine leaks when you laugh, sneeze, or cough, or
when you jump vigorously during exercise (jogging and jumping jacks
can be problematic). Many women whose pelvic muscle tone is shot
because of bearing children or having surgery suffer stress incontinence.
The stress in stress incontinence has nothing to do with psychological
pain you may or may not be feeling; it refers to the stress in your
abdomen. When you cough or laugh, you create pressure in your
abdomen, which puts pressure on the bladder, causing the bladder pres-
sure to become greater than urethral pressure. So laughing and cough-
ing set off a chain reaction that ends in leakage.
About a third of the women who suffer from stress incontinence are pre-
menopausal. After menopause, it can get worse.
 Urge incontinence: A less common type of incontinence. With urge
incontinence, you feel a tremendous urge to urinate, but before you can
get to the bathroom, you begin leaking. You get “caught short” because
you just can’t make it to the bathroom fast enough.
Spasms in your bladder cause this type of incontinence. Urge inconti-
nence is usually caused by a more serious medical problem such as a
herniated disk in your back, fibroids (little, noncancerous wads of
tissue), nerve damage, or even bladder cancer. Contact your doctor
right away so he or she can check out this condition.
104
Part II: The Effects of Menopause on Your Body and Mind 

Trying some treatments
See your doctor if you experience any type of incontinence. Incontinence
may be a symptom of another medical condition, and treating the symptom
may not be the best way to treat the whole disease.
Incontinence due to weakened muscles in the pelvic floor can be treated with
Kegel exercises, which strengthen the muscles around your urethra. If you
went to childbirth classes, you may have heard of these exercises. Well,
Kegels are as useful in menopause as they were after childbirth.
Strengthening the muscles supporting the urethra keeps you from leaking
urine when you laugh, cough, or exercise. Kegel exercises also can help you
improve the muscle tone in your pubococcygeous (PC) muscle — the muscle
you use to stop urine from flowing.
The biggest problem with Kegels is that most women aren’t taught the right
way to do them, so they don’t get the full benefit. The nearby “Strengthening
with Kegels in three easy steps” sidebar starts your Kegel program off on the
right foot. Kegels can be especially effective when combined with biofeed-
back techniques.
Kegels can improve muscle tone, but they don’t strengthen thinned tissue. If
thinning tissue is the cause of incontinence, surgery may be the appropriate
treatment.
Some other methods you can use to handle incontinence caused by weak-
ened muscles include
 Pads: These pads are similar to the pads you wear during your men-
strual period, and they function the same way — the pad absorbs leaked
urine, and you change a used pad when you go to the bathroom. Gel-
affixed, foam pads are also available. These little devices are either
inserted like a tampon or worn over the opening of the urethra. You
have to change them after urinating. This type of pad is most useful for
women whose incontinence problem is primarily limited to certain activ-
ities such as exercise.
 Watching your weight: Maintaining a normal weight helps to relieve
stress on your pelvic floor.
 Silicone caps: Silicone-rubber caps inserted into the urethra are now
available and seem to reduce leakage by about 50 percent.
 Teflon or collagen injections: Some doctors are currently performing
these procedures. The injected Teflon or collagen strengthens the tis-
sues around the urethra or bladder neck by making them thicker. You
normally need multiple injections.
105
Chapter 7: Dealing with Vaginal and Urinary Changes

 Vaginal cones: This approach uses little weights (vaginal cones) to
strengthen muscles related to controlling urine flow. You insert a
tampon-like cone into your vagina and hold it there. The goal is to gradu-
ally increase the weight and the amount of time you hold the cone in
place.
Talk to your doctor about these solutions and others (such as electrical stim-
ulation and vaginal urethral rings). Medications are available that inhibit
bladder contractions, increase the fortitude of the bladder lining, or relax
smooth muscle in both the urethra and bladder — all of which can help curb
symptoms of incontinence. These medications include probanthine, flavox-
ate, oxybutynin, and imipramine — all of which control bladder spasms. As
always, medications have side effects.
If your sleep is interrupted by incontinence, you restrict the amount of fluids
you drink after dinner. Be sure to drink enough fluid during the day to make
up for the curfew.
106
Part II: The Effects of Menopause on Your Body and Mind 
Strengthening with Kegels in three easy steps
Every time you go to the bathroom, end the
outing with a series of Kegel exercises.
Although medical professionals usually say you
only need do these exercises three times each
day, you won’t have to tax your memory if you
just do them every time you urinate. If you follow
this advice, you’ll ensure that you’re exercising
routinely and frequently — two requirements
for successfully strengthening the pubococcy-
geous (PC) muscle, which helps you stop urine
from flowing. Here are the three steps to a
stronger PC:
1. While you’re urinating, squeeze the muscle
you use to stop the flow of urine. Now that
you’ve found your PC muscle, you’re ready
for the workout.
2. Squeeze the PC muscle for 3 seconds (one
one-thousand, two one-thousand, three
one-thousand) and then relax for 5 seconds.
Try to squeeze only your PC muscle, keep-
ing your thigh, abdomen, and buttocks mus-
cles relaxed. Squeezing the other muscles
actually works against the exercise
because it creates pressure above the ure-
thra, which makes it difficult to squeeze the
PC muscle. Do this exercise five times every
time you go to the bathroom.
3. Work up to holding each squeeze for 10
seconds and relaxing for 5 seconds in
between squeezes. Continue doing five of
these each time you go to the bathroom.
After 6 to 8 weeks, you should notice an
improvement in your ability to control the flow
of your urine. Practice while you’re actually uri-
nating to see if you can completely stop the
flow.

N
o, you’re not going crazy or losing your mind if you think that your skin
has gotten drier over the years. Face it — dry skin happens. And it’s
likely to be related — at least in part — to menopause. Depending on which
scientists you believe, the sags and wrinkles in your face may or may not be
due to lower levels of estrogen. Don’t worry — we give you both sides of the
story in this chapter.
Dealing with your hair can get a little, well, hairy, too. If you’re like us, as a
child, you watched an aunt or grandma in total amazement, wondering how
that one hair on her chin got so long. Does grandma have to shave? Read on
to find out why the hair on your head seems to get thinner even as it pops up
in unwelcome places like your face.
We’ll be the first ones to admit that no one is going to win a Nobel Prize for
discovering a pill to relieve the conditions described in this chapter. In the
grand scheme of things, these conditions may be mosquito bites in relation
to the other issues that women face during and after menopause. But they’re
really annoying, and they vex our vanity! So it’s nice to know why they
happen and what you can do about them. We’re also here to help you figure
out what you can’t do (and thus avoid those sounds-too-good-to-be-true
products you see on the late-night infomercials or the shelves of your local
drugstore). That’s what this chapter is for.

Getting the Skinny on Skin
Usually, during perimenopause (the years leading up to menopause) and
menopause, you’re on a heightened state of alert, looking for the changes you
know are happening. You expect your periods to change, and you’re probably
not all that surprised by vaginal and urinary changes. But one day you look
down and realize the texture on the skin on the back of your hands has
become less like satin and more like crepe. Suddenly you have a few extra
laugh lines or crow’s feet around your eyes. You may also notice dry skin or
dry scalp that you never had before. But wait — menopause can’t affect the
outside of you, too, can it? 
Making the skin and hormone connection
Menopause (more specifically the associated decline of estrogen levels)
probably accelerates many of the little annoying changes that accompany
aging. But separating the skin changes due to low estrogen from those that
come as a result of being on this planet for a long time can be difficult. Think
about it. Forty plus years of gravity is going to contribute to sagginess. No
matter whether you’re a woman or a man, your skin has been fighting grav-
ity’s weight ever since you could sit upright. By the time you approach your
70s, you’re left with jowls instead of cheeks and a turkey wattle instead of a
nice, tight neck, and you’ve learned never to look down into a mirror.
Placing blame for skin woes
Besides gravity, a lot of other things contribute to the aging of your skin. The
first one is age itself — simple wear and tear. We just can’t expect to go on
looking like dewy skinned children forever. Muscle movement, sun damage,
inflammation, medications, and other medical treatments can all take the
bloom off the roses in our cheeks.
But estrogen (and its loss during menopause) does play a role in the great
skin caper. The collagen and elastin fibers that keep your skin supple, pliant,
and nicely molded to your frame slowly deteriorate as the active form of
estrogen declines. The degeneration of collagen and elastin fibers leaves
room for wrinkles. Wrinkles (creases in your skin) show up where muscles
contract. For example, when you smile, several facial muscles pull tight, form-
ing one or more lines in the skin adjacent to your mouth. With age, these
lines stay behind even when you’re not smiling. Other wrinkles resemble
straight or branched lines finely etched all over the weakened skin. These
wrinkles are also the result of the double dip of low estrogen levels and aging.
The fatty layer under your skin disappears over time as well, and your skin
loses its flexibility — which leads not only to facial wrinkles, but to a loss of
firmness and smoothness to your whole birthday suit. If your skin were
108
Part II: The Effects of Menopause on Your Body and Mind 

clothes, you’d probably go to the tailor to have it taken in. (In fact, some
women do go to the tailor, also known as the plastic surgeon, to have the
sags tucked.)
Medical folks are divided on how much blame to apportion to gravity and
how much to assign to declining levels of estrogen. Some scientists claim that
skin changes are just part of aging, but others feel that low levels of estrogen
during the years leading up to and after menopause hasten a lot of these
changes in your skin.
The hormone-imbalance crowd points out that estrogen helps bring moisture
to body tissue. Menopause causes lower levels of estradiol (the active kind of
estrogen), which causes tissues and mucus membranes all over your body to
act strangely. How strangely? Some women develop pimples and dry skin at
the same time.
But the bottom line here is that during perimenopause and menopause your
skin loses its elasticity and tightness — it becomes thinner and saggier. As
the fatty layer under your skin thins out over time, it will be easier to see
your blood vessels, and you’ll bruise more easily. Because your skin is less
pliant, it tears more easily than it used to — so you may encounter more
minor cuts and scrapes.
Also, the skin-maintenance process slows down as part of the normal aging
process in both men and women, so your body doesn’t regenerate skin as
quickly as it used to — another reason you may bruise and cut more easily
and heal more slowly.
Slowing the process down
Whether estrogen treatments are effective in slowing the skin-aging process
in menopausal women is still debatable. (Especially because some experts
don’t believe that shifting hormones has anything to do with skin changes in
the first place.) Experts sit on both sides of the fence.
If you want to try an estrogen treatment, skin creams (you can call them
transdermal estradiol therapies if you’re feeling pretentious) seem to be more
effective than oral estrogen in preserving skin collagen. But don’t get overly
optimistic about the results. When you see those smiling, wrinkle-free faces
on the estrogen-cream advertisements, you can be sure that it’s not the estro-
gen skin cream that gives those women their smooth skin, big breasts, and
girlish figures.
Shining a light on the sun’s dangers
The sun is public enemy number one for the skin. Sun exposure can cause
wrinkles when you’re in your 20s or early 30s, and it can cause your skin to
become leathery and unevenly colored years before perimenopause.
109
Chapter 8: Examining Your Skin and Hair on Menopause

Reining in UV rays
The sun’s ultraviolet rays (UV) inflict the greatest harm on your skin. UV rays
from the sun destroy collagen fibers. Remember, the collagen fibers hold the
skin tight and keep it from sagging and wrinkling. The skin has a normal main-
tenance process in which old skin is sloughed off and new skin is rebuilt. UV
radiation messes up this process so that the collagen fibers become disorga-
nized and form “solar scars.” Just 5 to 15 minutes of sunbathing for fair- to
moderate-skinned people can trash the skin-maintenance process for a week.
UV radiation from the sun also causes a buildup of a substance that causes
the skin to stretch (abnormal elastin).
If you use skin creams containing AHA (alpha-hydroxy acids) in an effort to
combat wrinkles, you can create another reason to be careful in the sun. These
substances increase your skin’s sensitivity to the sun, and thus heighten your
risk of sun damage. If you’re using products containing AHA, shield your skin
from the sun and wear a sunblock with an SPF of at least 15 or higher.
SPF, or sun protection factor, is described as a number that tells you how
long you can remain in the sun, while wearing the product, without beginning
to burn. Other factors (such as sweating, swimming, or friction from playing
sports) can shorten sunblock’s period of effectiveness. 
110
Part II: The Effects of Menopause on Your Body and Mind 
Working on wrinkles
Nothing prevents wrinkles like staying out of the
sun. But if the damage has already been done,
you can check out products that claim to retard
the wrinkling process:
 Retinoid creams: These products often
make use of the terms retinoic acid,
tretinoin, and the trademark Retin-A.
Retinoids are vitamin-A acids. To the extent
that they work, they do so by smoothing out
skin pigmentation (color), reducing brown
spots and wrinkles, and giving skin a rosy
appearance. Usually, several months of use
are necessary before you notice any
improvement. 
 Alpha-hydroxy creams:
Alpha-hydroxy
acids work like a skin peel. They help
remove surface skin cells, making your skin
look rosier and smoother. Some advertisers
claim that alpha hydroxy helps your skin
produce new collagen and elastin. If this
were true, alpha hydroxy would actually
improve the layers under the skin, filling the
wrinkles in from the inside out and revers-
ing the aging process. Yeah, we wish. Some
of the side effects of alpha hydroxy include
burning, itching, and general skin pain.
Newer products that contain beta-hydroxy
acids incorporate a mild aspirin-like sub-
stance into the product, which is supposed
to eliminate skin irritation.
 Botox: Wrinkles are caused by contraction
of facial muscles (as we discuss in the
“Making the skin and hormone connection”
section earlier in this chapter). Botox, a
purified form of the botulism toxin, is
injected into the facial muscles. It tem-
porarily removes the wrinkle because the
toxin temporarily paralyzes or weakens the
affected muscles. When the muscles relax,
the wrinkle disappears. After several
months, the paralysis wears off and the
wrinkle returns.

Taking extra-large doses of vitamin A in an effort to improve your skin won’t
work. Mega-doses of vitamin A are toxic — don’t try it!
Caring about skin cancer
Along with lesser problems, UV radiation can cause skin cancer — a serious
side effect of too much sun. Skin cancer can show up years after long-term
exposure to the sun.
By the time you’re menopausal, your risk of skin cancer is higher because
you’ve been exposed to UV radiation for quite a few years. Malignant
melanoma is a rather rare but deadly form of skin cancer. It’s most commonly
diagnosed in folks in their early 50s.
When you’re in the sun for too long, the sun’s UV radiation penetrates your
skin and gets down into the DNA inside the skin cells. It zaps and damages
the DNA — serious stuff because cell reproduction is based on DNA. Any mis-
takes in the DNA can have serious ramifications down the line. Sometimes,
genetic mutations produce cancerous skin tumors. UV rays also suppress the
skin’s immune system, leaving your skin susceptible to cancer cells.
111
Chapter 8: Examining Your Skin and Hair on Menopause
Being a skin-savvy consumer
If snake oil were an effective moisturizer, thou-
sands of women who’ve spent hundreds of
thousands of dollars on questionable anti-aging
skin care products would have absolutely radi-
ant skin. Aging and menopause aren’t for
sissies, but feeling good about our appearance
is important. That’s why it’s so upsetting that a
number of companies prey on our fears about
aging and losing our youthful good looks.
Many of the creams and lotions and potions we
hear about every day do give at least the tem-
porary appearance and feel of smoother,
younger looking skin. Some of them just make
us feel good. And if you think all the claims you
hear and read are legitimate, that would be
understandable. After all, doesn’t the govern-
ment regulate stuff like this for our protection?
Well, yes and no. The U.S. Food and Drug
Administration doesn’t have the authority to
regulate what goes into cosmetics. They can
only get involved if they’ve received reports that
a product has caused harm, or if the sellers of a
particular skin product makes claims that it
works like a medicine or actually changes the
structure of a part of your body — such as
curing wrinkles. When in doubt about a partic-
ular product, ask your doctor or a dermatologist
about how realistic its claims are.
Be wary of products that claim to use “scien-
tific” or “high-tech” breakthroughs to make
your body produce more collagen (creams and
lotions can’t get inside your skin to make this
happen), turn back time, restore aging skin, or
permanently cure wrinkles. You may get
plumper (and thus less visible) wrinkles, but you
could also end up with a much thinner wallet.

Preventing premature skin aging
If you worry about the appearance of your skin, you’re probably wondering
how you can combat the skin changes that accompany the aging process and
menopause. Well, here you go. These are a few ways to keep your skin look-
ing youthful and firm for as long as you can:
 Don’t smoke. On average, smokers have thinner skin and more wrinkles
than non-smokers. A heavy smoker is five times more likely to have a
wrinkled face than a non-smoker of the same age. A 40-year-old, heavy
smoker has the face of a non-smoking 60-year-old in terms of wrinkles.
 Drink plenty of water. Internal hydration can help your skin look
plumper (which makes wrinkles look less evident) and more youthful.
 Follow a regular and sensible skin care regimen. Cleanse your skin
daily with a mild cleanser suitable to your skin’s level of oiliness, follow
with a mild toner, and finish with a good, basic moisturizer (no need to
break the bank). You may not turn back the clock, but you’ll probably be
happier with how your skin looks and feels.
 Avoid exposure to the sun. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation accounts
for 90 percent of the symptoms of premature skin aging. It’s also the
most significant cause of skin cancers.
An awful lot of products that claim to reverse the aging of our hair and skin
are advertised by “Dr.” this and “Dr.” that. Sometimes they’re real medical
doctors and sometimes they’re not. Some legitimate doctors even market
their own skin care product lines. Even some of these may cross a different
line — an ethical one — when they claim to cure wrinkles or restore youth.
Shame on them — be skeptical and take your questions to your own doctor. 
Handling Hairy Issues
Gray hair has nothing to do with menopause, except that both tend to occur
in women over 40. But menopause does bring about changes in hair patterns
in ways you may never have imagined, including losing hair on your head and
growing it on your face.
The hormonal imbalances of menopause can be responsible for those few
hairs on your chin or other spots on your face. Hormone therapy helps
restore some of the balance between hormones in your body, thus helping to
preserve your hair (on your head) and protect your chin from hair growth.
112
Part II: The Effects of Menopause on Your Body and Mind 

Here’s why hair loss is more likely to happen after menopause: Hair follicles
are receptive to hormones. Female hormone (estrogen) levels decrease faster
than male hormone (androgen) levels, so where you once had very high levels
of active estrogen and very low levels of androgen, you now have low levels of
androgen but much lower levels of active estrogen. These lower levels of
estrogen aren’t enough to block the effects of the androgen, one of which is
hair loss.
Losing it — your hair, that is
We all lose a little hair every day. As hair grows, a few of the older strands
jump ship every day. You see them in your hairbrush, but you might not think
much about them until you wonder whether some day there will be more in
your brush than on your head. As you age, hair growth slows, and the hairs
that fall out aren’t replaced as rapidly. About one-third of women between the
ages of 40 and 80 find their hair thinning all over their scalp but more so on
the crown of the head. This is called female pattern baldness. The amount of
hair loss varies from woman to woman. 
Hair loss in women tends to be hereditary. There are other causes of hair loss
in gals, too. These include thyroid disorders, pituitary tumors, stress, poly-
cystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), lupus, stress, and chemotherapy. So if your
hair begins leaving you at an alarming rate, check with your doctor before
you assume that it’s “just” a normal symptom of aging. 
Taking care of your hair
Some women have had success using minoxidil, the same treatment recom-
mended for balding men. This medication is better at preserving hair than
retrieving what was lost, so if you’re going to try it, seek help quickly.
Let’s face it — our hair is important to us. It’s one of the first things people
notice about us. It’s a built-in accessory. There are things we can do, though,
to minimize the impact of lock loss:
 Be kind to your hair. Use soft brushes with gentle bristles. Only brush
your hair as needed and treat your hair tenderly when you do. Avoid
styles that involve pulling the hair back tightly. 
 Get a great haircut that makes the most of what you have. Soft layers
maximize fullness. Shorter is better than longer — extra length can pull
hair down, making it look even thinner.
113
Chapter 8: Examining Your Skin and Hair on Menopause

 Use a mild shampoo and don’t over-condition. Heavy conditioners can
also weigh hair down and emphasize thinness.
 After styling your hair, hang your head down and use your fingers to
fluff hair up before righting yourself. This adds height and the illusion
of fullness to your hair.
 Work with your stylist to find products that add height and texture to
your hair. Light piecing waxes or gels can work well if you take a few
minutes to learn how to use them.
Unless you use a physician-prescribed medication such as minoxidil to stop
falling hair, or resort to hair transplants (some women do, with varying
results), restoring the lush look of your crowning glory may be a little like
using anti-aging creams to fight wrinkles. Although you may not be able to
reverse the effects of aging on your hair, you may succeed at keeping up
appearances.

ravo for life’s little ironies. You may discover that at about the same
time your kids are moving on (and out), you finally have the leisure (and
the cash) for those romantic weekends; your doctor gives you the green light
to toss your contraception; your body is ready to make whoopie; but your
sex organs are preparing for retirement. Or you may discover that your
organs are still willing, but your hormones are not. 
On the other hand, you may expect interest in and capacity for great sex to
decline, only to discover that menopause is the best thing that ever hap-
pened to your sex life. Just don’t just assume that the dire predictions about
loss of libido and dewy freshness giving way to disinterest and dryness are
the rule for everyone. Lots of women find sex after menopause to be better
than ever.
There’s no question, though, that sex changes after menopause — your hor-
monal shifts have repercussions for your private parts as well as your emo-
tional parts. There’s also plenty of pesky cultural silliness to deal with — an
awful lot of folks still hold to the idea that women of a certain age aren’t sup-
posed to be sexy, or sexual. In this chapter we’ll talk about why you shouldn’t
kiss your sex life goodbye just yet, why you still need to be careful about
birth control (and why it may not be too late for a baby if that’s where your
heart lies), and suggest some ways to keep the home fires burning as you
approach and enter menopause.

Looking at Menopause and Your Libido
Menopause opens a new chapter in your life, so it’s no surprise that the
sexual you changes as well. In many cases, the changes are for the better.
Even though there’s never been a medical reason for you to abstain from sex
during your period, most women and their partners refrain from sex for those
days. Now that those menstrual periods have hit the road (or are at least pack-
ing for the journey), you have more opportunities for sex. And remember how
you always seemed to get your period when you were on vacation, no matter
how well you planned? Now you can play around until your heart’s content
without checking and double-checking for those red circles on your calendar.
The crankiness, cramps, and headaches that characterized much of your men-
strual cycle now level out into a kinder and gentler expression of you.
Libido often declines with age. Most scientific studies have found that little
change in sexual activity occurs between the ages of 45 and 55. But, between
55 and 65, sexual activity slows.
And, though women in their 60s may not engage in sex as often as they did in
their younger years, no change occurs in the frequency of orgasm or the level
of sexual enjoyment. So, you may not do it as often, but sex is just as satisfy-
ing. (An interesting note: Research shows that activity with sexual partners
often slows down long before women discontinue masturbating.) Quality
doesn’t have to decline just because quantity does!
The fluctuating hormones that characterize menopause and perimenopause
definitely have an effect on your sex drive. Be prepared for a gradual increase —
or a gradual decrease — in your libido. Of course, you may not be aware of any
change at all, but most menopausal women experience at least brief periods of
a higher- or lower-than-usual sex drive.
Letting your feelings be your guide
When it comes down to it, no one knows your body better than you do, so
pay attention to it. Because every woman experiences menopause a little dif-
ferently, your medical advisor may not be familiar with what’s normal for you —
and what seems different to you. Learn to trust yourself and communicate
openly with your doctor.
This advice goes double for changes in your libido (desire to have sex). Many
doctors ignore sexual issues when treating perimenopausal and menopausal
women. So it’s important that you bring up the issue if your doctor doesn’t.
116
Part II: The Effects of Menopause on Your Body and Mind 

Here are some helpful hints for talking to your doctor:
 Doctors have heard everything; don’t feel embarrassed about your ques-
tions or concerns. If you don’t feel comfortable discussing sex and sexu-
ality with your doctor, find one who’s more engaging. 
 Raise your questions early in the appointment. Take a moment right
after the “Hi, how are you doing today” part to raise the issue by saying
something such as, “ . . . and there’s another problem that we need to
solve before I leave today.” Waiting until you’re actually walking out the
door to bring up a sensitive issue happens so often that doctors actually
have a name for the phenomenon: “the doorknob moment.”
 Keep a diary of any pain, discomfort, or discharge you experience
related to sex. Track things such as how long it lasts, what activity may
have caused the problem, and the level and nature of pain you felt.
 Sexual responsiveness is a natural process, not a right reserved for spe-
cial people. If you’re experiencing troublesome changes in your sexual
desire after menopause, be direct with your doctor. The problem may be
hormonal (low testosterone levels) or there may be other medical rea-
sons for the change.
 If your doctor can rule out medical problems that might be interfering
with your sexual satisfaction, but doesn’t seem comfortable helping you
pursue a solution, ask for a referral to a specialist — in this case, an
accredited sex therapist. 
Turning up the heat
More than half of all menopausal women maintain the same level of sexual
interest after menopause as before. In fact, you may feel less inhibited when
the possibility of pregnancy no longer looms over the bed. After you can
safely put away the contraceptive devices (after you have gone a whole year
without a period), you can be freer to express yourself sexually. 
The famous sex research team of Masters and Johnson proved to the world
that sexual appetite is not tied to estrogen levels (although you may need a
little lubricant to make sex comfortable after estrogen declines). It’s really the
androgens (male sex hormones such as testosterone) produced by your ovaries
throughout your life that keep your sex drive running. Even after menopause
(when your ovaries have gotten out of the estradiol- and progesterone-production
game), your ovaries keep on producing androgens.

Chapter 9: Maintaining Your Sex Life Through Menopause

If you have sex with more than one partner during or after menopause, you
still need to practice safe sex to avoid picking up a sexually transmitted dis-
ease or AIDS.
Even though men don’t go through menopause, their testosterone levels
gradually decline after 40. The physiological changes don’t happen overnight.
Over time, men will notice that it takes longer for them to get an erection and
that they aren’t aroused as easily, which may be good news for a woman who
enjoys foreplay. Women whose partners suffer premature ejaculation can
rejoice. That problem may go away and men gain lasting power as they age.
Even if you’re having fewer periods (or perhaps you haven’t had one in
months), don’t give up your birth control until you’ve been without periods
for a full year. During perimenopause, your hormone levels and the chance of
ovulation are wildly unpredictable. It’s unlikely, but you could just have a hor-
monally hot month and wind up pregnant.
Dealing with a lowered libido
A healthy self-image and adult lifestyle generally include satisfying and safe
sexual activity. Yet many (but not all) women are frustrated by a declining
desire for sex during and after menopause. Understanding the biology behind
a declining libido can help bring about a solution.
Your sex drive can decline sooner than you’d like for several reasons. Some
are mental or emotional — if your self-esteem declines because of changes in
your life or in your body, you may have to address that issue before you can
find your old libido. Some of the reasons are physical — painful sex is noth-
ing to look forward to. And some are hormonal — your hormones are chang-
ing, and if you’d like to maintain your sex drive, your hormones must be
balanced.
Communicating with your doctor is even more important if you’ve experi-
enced early menopause. If your doctor takes your concerns about sex lightly,
find another doctor. You won’t be able to get pregnant after menopause, but
you can still have a hot and healthy sex life.
Adjusting your attitude
It’s hard to feel amorous when you’re depressed. Menopause, in itself, doesn’t
make you depressed, but think about the types of things happening during
these years:
118
Part II: The Effects of Menopause on Your Body and Mind 

 Kids leaving home
 Parents aging and needing closer attention
 You or your spouse retiring
Add to these challenges the everyday issues of maintaining a happy relation-
ship and just coping in a fast-paced world. Now, the one thing that used to be
reliable, your body, is also changing at a faster pace than it has in quite some
time. Is it any wonder that sex is the last thing on your mind?
But if the lack of physical spark bothers you, you need to get rid of the emo-
tional stressors before you can expect your libido to kick in. It may just take
allocating more time to yourself. Take some time to get an exercise program
off the ground. Walking regularly by yourself or with a friend can do plenty to
reduce stress. Talk with friends, a therapist, your hairdresser, or minister
about your challenges. Also, remember to bring up your anxiety or depres-
sion when you talk to your internist or gynecologist.
Making sure that sex isn’t a hurtin’ thing
Hormonal changes can cause the vaginal lining to become thinner, more frag-
ile, and more susceptible to tearing and to produce less lubrication. You’re
more delicate down there — a bit more tender. Vaginal connective tissue also
becomes less pliant, and nerve endings become more sensitive.
The result of this biological shuffle is that intercourse may become painful.
Sexual activity that used to deliver great pleasure can now cause pain
instead. The thought of the discomfort may make you want to get a headache
or clean out your sock drawer when your partner makes amorous advances,
but all is not lost. You can alleviate painful intercourse in a variety of ways:
 Maintain an active sex life. Regular sexual activity keeps blood circulat-
ing in your vulva and slows the drying process. So maintaining an active
sex life helps postpone or altogether avoid the pain associated with dry
vaginal tissues. This is definitely one of those “use it or lose it situations.”
 Talk to your partner about the more sensitive you. Most men aren’t
aware that hormonal changes trigger changes in your vulva and vagina.
Explain to your partner that the two of you need to figure out new bed-
room strategies that can be mutually satisfying.
 Take a firm position. This is a great time to experiment with new posi-
tions for sex. We’re not going to tell you which pages in the Kama Sutra
to consult, but woman-on-top positions may give you more control over
your own comfort.
119
Chapter 9: Maintaining Your Sex Life Through Menopause

 Use a lubricant during intercourse to help keep things moving.
Lubricants can afford hours of interpersonal pleasure. Some women and
their partners make lubricant application a part of foreplay. Water-based
lubricants, such as Astroglide, are healthier for vaginal linings. Avoid
petroleum-based products.
Sometimes women experience regular discomfort due to vaginal dryness —
not just during sex. If you’re one of them, you can use other types of lubri-
cants on a regular basis to relieve this irritation. (See the product literature
for recommended dosage, and check out Chapter 7 on tips for dealing with
vaginal dryness.)

Part II: The Effects of Menopause on Your Body and Mind 
It’s not the estrogen!
Many reports and books make a huge deal
about the fact that no scientific evidence links
changes in estrogen levels to a declining libido.
These publications then make the leap to erro-
neously conclude that hormones have nothing
to do with libido. Although the estrogen, itself,
may not play the deciding role in libido regula-
tion, the balance between estrogen and testos-
terone likely makes a difference.
This subject is a bit controversial so we want to
give you both sides of the argument. On one
side are scientists who conclude that supple-
menting your testosterone during menopause
increases your libido. On the other side are the
lab coats who believe that the science doesn’t
exist to show that prescribing testosterone is
either safe or effective for women who com-
plain of low libido.
Testosterone is produced naturally by women’s
ovaries and has a very positive impact on your
libido, mood, vitality, sense of well being, bone,
and muscle. But, even before menopause, your
body slows down its production of testosterone.
After menopause, you produce about half as
much testosterone as you produced during your
reproductive years. So it’s not unusual for your
libido to decline if your testosterone levels are
too low.
You don’t want to have too much testosterone
either — it can promote breast and liver cancer.
Plus, too much testosterone relative to estrogen
can unleash the effects of testosterone that
estrogen had been keeping under control, such
as facial hair, increased libido, redistribution of
body fat (it moves to the middle of your body),
and acne.
Some doctors shy away from prescribing
testosterone as part of hormone therapy (HT)
because they’re afraid of upsetting the estro-
gen/testosterone balance and causing unpleas-
ant side effects. The trick, whether you’re taking
HT with testosterone or not, is to keep testos-
terone levels high enough to avoid one set of
side effects (including low libido) and in balance
with the other hormones to avoid another set of
side effects (facial hair or acne, for example).
Those folks in the scientific and medical com-
munities who view testosterone as a worthy
treatment for libido problems believe that the
bad side effects felt by some women are
caused by excessively high dosages of testos-
terone. Proponents of testosterone use suggest
using very low dosages and maintaining a bal-
ance between the levels of testosterone and
estrogen.

Don’t use estrogen cream as a sexual lubricant. The estrogen cream can be
absorbed by your partner and cause problems. At least one case of breast
cancer has been reported in a man because his wife used vaginal estrogen
cream as a lubricant. It’s important to read the instructions!
Talking Turkey about Testosterone
Don’t forget that men, as well as women, experience declining libido as they
age! If you’re noticing changes in your sexual relationship, remember that
your partner’s hormones are changing too. Men produce much more testos-
terone than women, but when they reach 40, their testosterone levels begin
declining. However, most men don’t notice an appreciable change in their
libido for about another 10 years. Around the age of 50 or so, the drop in
testosterone causes men to stop having psychogenic erections (erections from
just thinking about sex), and men who could have an erection at the drop of a
hat find that it’s a bit harder (no pun intended) to get things moving.
So, if you’re worried because your partner isn’t pursuing you like he used to,
your menopause may not be at the heart of the matter. Your partner may be
going through hormonal changes of his own, even though his change isn’t as
dramatic as yours. You may even find that his changes are compatible with
yours. It may take him longer to reach orgasm than it used to, giving both of
you more time for long, slow, comfortable lovemaking. 
Keeping Sex Sexy
If you’ve noticed some changes in your sexual relationship, work with your
partner to make things better. Your relationship can evolve to a new level of
meaning and pleasure.
First, you need to communicate with your partner and take stock of the situa-
tion. Is it a libido thing for you? Is it a libido thing for him? Is it technique? Is
it timing? You need to find out what’s going on.
As you and your partner get older and both your testosterone levels decline,
it’s time to focus on foreplay. You may both need more stimulation before
intercourse — take your time! And you may need to incorporate lubricants
into your foreplay if you have vaginal dryness.
Don’t just focus on the anticipated orgasm (yours and your partner’s). Enjoy
each moment. Take time to enjoy all the feelings along the way. If actual inter-
course is uncomfortable today, or just not happening, it’s fine to enjoy other
sensual activities together: a bath or shower, a massage, or watching a sexy
movie together.
121
Chapter 9: Maintaining Your Sex Life Through Menopause

You may also have to use different techniques to provide enough stimulation
for your man to get an erection — you may have to work a little magic to get
his penis into position at this stage of his life. Hand stimulation or oral sex
may be what it takes to get him started. You can also turn to books and coun-
selors — two good sources of information on sexual techniques and other
sexual matters for mature adults. Ask your doctor to recommend a sex thera-
pist accredited by the American Association of Sex Educators, Counselors
and Therapists (www.aasect.org). If you think your sexual issues are related
to concerns about your relationship, look for a sex therapist who is also a
licensed couples or marital therapist; many are both.
Although we baby boomers come from the “sex, booze, and drugs” genera-
tion, these words no longer work together. Take a look at some of the things
that can douse your flame:
 Alcohol: One drink may make you feel relaxed and less inhibited, but
several drinks can put a damper on your libido, your ability to become
aroused, your performance, and your ability to reach orgasm.
 Heavy meals: The way to your partner’s heart might be through a
gourmet dinner, but if your intended destination is a little, um, further
south, go light on the eats. You can always have dinner in bed after.
 Prescription drugs: Serotonin boosters, antidepressants, blood pres-
sure pills, sleeping pills, and many other drugs frequently prescribed for
women and men over 50 can take a toll on your libido — or your part-
ner’s. Let your gynecologist and internist know what medications you
take when you discuss your libido and sexual performance. Alternative
medications may be available that can alleviate some of the negative
side effects.
 Tobacco products: The nicotine in cigarettes and other tobacco prod-
ucts constricts the blood vessels making it more difficult for blood to
rush to your private parts. It’s harder to get aroused and harder still to
experience a satisfactory conclusion.
Diabetes and other medical problems also cause loss of sexual desire and
performance problems. Be sure to consult with your doctor about changes in
your libido because they can result from medical conditions other than
menopause.

Chapter 9: Maintaining Your Sex Life Through Menopause
Starting over: The good news and the bad
Here’s the stereotype: you reach midlife, and
your husband leaves you for a newer model.
Does it happen? Sure it does. But are you ready
for a little myth busting? A 2004 survey of
divorced men and women aged 40 to 79, con-
ducted by the AARP, indicates that women are
more than twice as likely to initiate divorce in
midlife than are men.
Women have a longer life expectancy than men,
too, and are more likely than men to rejoin the
ranks of the single when a spouse dies. About 4
percent of women between the ages of 45 and
54 have been widowed. For women between 55
and 64, though, this figure has risen to almost 12
percent.
No matter how you get there, romance doesn’t
have to be a thing of the past when married
women become single again. Three-quarters of
divorced women in their 50s, for instance, went
on to have a serious sexual relationship. Many
describe their sex lives at this stage as being
better than ever.
Still, sex with a new partner (or partners) is not
completely without its complications. It may
have been years since you popped your last
birth control pill or wrestled with your last
diaphragm, but there are still potential risks
associated with sex with a new partner:
 There are a lot of ugly bugs out there: nei-
ther chlamydia, human papilloma virus
(HPV — some forms of which cause cervi-
cal cancer), gonorrhea, syphilis, hepatitis B,
hepatitis C, nor genital herpes care how old
you are. Menopausal women (and their
partners) can still get STDs — sexually
transmitted diseases.
 HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is age-
blind, too, and becoming more prevalent in
older people as the population ages but
stays healthy enough for sex. Ten percent
of the people newly diagnosed with HIV
every year are over 50.
 The great estrogen flight changes the 
environment in your vagina, making it easier
to contract vaginal infections. Some of
these — such as bacterial vaginosis or viral
vaginitis — aren’t necessarily caused by
sex but are more common in sexually active
women. Anecdotal evidence suggests that
some of these may be more likely to occur
when you’ve been with a new partner or
partners. Others, such as trichomoniasis
vaginosis (“trich”), can be passed among
sexual partners (you and your partner must
both be treated with oral antibiotics if you
get trich).
Not all lubricants are friends with the latex condoms you will need to wear 
with new partners to prevent the spread of STDs. Vaseline and other petroleum-
based lubricants weaken both male and female condoms. Petroleum-based
products may also contribute to vaginal infections.

Flirting with Fertility
For most of us, our menstruating years have been pretty much synonymous
with the years when we expected to be able to get pregnant if we wanted to.
We might have spent a chunk of this time wishing to conceive. Or fervently
hoping not to conceive. Or dreaming of a little magic switch that could turn
our fertility off and on according to our desires and circumstances, with none
of the hassle, mess, or potential side effects accompanying our contraceptive
options. If men were the ones who could get pregnant, we’re willing to bet
that medical science would have figured out a nice, neat, affordable, discreet
form of birth control — years ago — but don’t get us started on that one.
As it happens, the end of fertility doesn’t coincide as neatly with the onset of
perimenopause as we might think — or like. For many women at both ends of
the wishing-and-hoping fertility continuum, this can be problematic.
Staying fertile after all these years . . .
Maybe you just can’t wait for menopause to bring freedom from the need to
wonder and worry about birth control. Not all of today’s available methods
are right for every woman. Your own personal medical history, financial situa-
tion (some of this stuff is expensive), relationship circumstances, or personal
beliefs can complicate the way you browse through the contraceptive menu.
And, except for a few of our more dramatic choices (such as surgical steriliza-
tion or complete abstinence), few of our birth control options are completely
foolproof.
The truth is, you can’t tell very much about the state of your fertility from the
regularity (or even the presence or absence) of your periods. Unless you’ve
gone an entire 12 months without a menstrual period, it’s entirely possible
that you can still get pregnant (admit it — don’t you have a friend or two with
a child whose middle name is “Surprise”?). Trouble is, lots of women don’t
know that and quit using contraception a wee bit earlier than is medically
advisable.
If you’re over 40, your risk (or promise, depending on your point of view) of
pregnancy is quite low. It is not, however, zero. Among women under 40, 170
women out of every 1,000 get pregnant every year. Among women over 40,
this number drops to about 11 out of 1,000 (some of these were intended
pregnancies, some were not). This means two important things for you if you
don’t want to get pregnant:
124
Part II: The Effects of Menopause on Your Body and Mind 

 You have to continue to use birth control faithfully.
 You have to use a method with a high degree of reliability in the face of
decreasing predictability of ovulation. The “rhythm” method, for
instance, never the most reliable of birth control methods even in earlier
stages of your life, is downright risky if the number of days between
your periods is becoming unpredictable.
Women over 40 rank only slightly lower than teenage girls and women in
their early 20s in their rate of unintended pregnancies. Over half of all preg-
nancies to women over 40 are unplanned. If you don’t want to get pregnant,
and you haven’t gone an entire year without a period, take precautions!
Taking one more chance on the stork
Maybe, though, the signs of approaching menopause have sent you into an
emotional tailspin. You aren’t alone if you are still trying for a baby when you
enter perimenopause. As we’ve said, it’s certainly not impossible to get preg-
nant at this point, but your odds are considerably lower than they were at 30
or even 40. The hormone dance that ends in menopause actually begins years
before you stop having periods. Most women don’t know what time the ball
begins and are shocked when they have trouble getting pregnant in their 30s. 
You may have had the same experience that we had when we were teenagers:
Parents, teachers, and even friends had us believing that practically all you
had to do to get pregnant was to jump in a swimming pool with a boy. Okay,
that’s a slight exaggeration, but generally, getting pregnant is easier when
you’re in your teens than when you’re in your 30s.
In fact, according to a recent study, a woman’s fertility begins to decline in
her late 20s, rather than her 30s, as previously thought. Researchers found
that even women in their early- to mid-20s have only a 50-50 chance of
becoming pregnant each cycle even if they have intercourse during the peak
time for conception. In your late 20s to early 30s, the chance drops to 40 per-
cent each cycle, and by the late 30s it’s less than a 30 percent chance.
By the way, that study also finds that men’s fertility also begins to decline
sooner than expected. Men begin to lose their fertility in their 30s rather than
in the 40s as was once thought. So if you’re in your late 30s and your partner
is five years older than you are, your chances of becoming pregnant in any
given cycle could drop to 20 percent. This doesn’t mean that you won’t con-
ceive if you’re in your late 30s; it just means that it may take a few months
longer, especially if your partner is older than you are.
125
Chapter 9: Maintaining Your Sex Life Through Menopause

Tracing the yin and yang of conception
Many things have to happen correctly to make a baby:
 Your ovaries must produce follicles.
 The follicles have to grow big enough to release an egg.
 Your hormones have to be just right for the egg to be released and sur-
vive the journey.
 Your fallopian tubes must be unobstructed so that the egg can swim all
the way through to the uterus to meet some nice sperm.
 Your hormones must create the right type of environment for the egg to
get fertilized and comfortably nestled into the lining of the uterus.
All these things have to come together for you to conceive. As you begin to
experience the hormonal changes of perimenopause, it becomes more likely
that one or more of these essential ingredients may be missing or mis-timed.
Out-of-whack hormones (and that’s the technical term — not!) are to blame
for most of the infertility problems perimenopausal women face.
Taking a dipstick to your estrogen
When you seek some assistance in your bid to get pregnant, one of the first
things fertility doctors do is check to see if you’re capable of ovulating. In
order to ovulate, you need both the right kind of estrogen and the right
amount of this particular form of estrogen in your bloodstream. This form of
estrogen is called estradiol, and your doctor will take a blood sample to check
your estradiol out.
As you approach menopause, your body produces less estradiol but contin-
ues to produce estrone. When it comes to producing follicles and ovulating,
estradiol is the kind that counts: Without adequate levels of estradiol, your
ovaries won’t produce an egg. By measuring both types of estrogen, your
doctor can see whether you’re heading toward menopause or whether you
have some other hormonal problems. (See Chapter 2 for more info on the dif-
ferent types of hormones women produce.)
Because your hormone levels fluctuate during perimenopause, you may still
have periods, but you may not ovulate each month. Your estradiol levels may
be sufficiently high one month and be low another month. Some months are
good for getting pregnant and some months are not so good. By measuring
your estradiol levels each month, your doctor will be able to see if it’s a good
month for producing an egg or not.
126
Part II: The Effects of Menopause on Your Body and Mind 

Messing up the nest with hormones
Sometimes hormonal problems occur after the follicle releases the egg.
Normally the follicle pops open to release the egg and then hangs around long
enough to produce progesterone (after the follicle releases the egg, the empty
sac is called a corpus luteum). The corpus luteum eventually disintegrates.
Progesterone production is necessary for thickening the uterine lining and
preparing it for the egg. If the follicle doesn’t produce enough progesterone,
problems arise that can put an end to conception. If the lining isn’t ready, the
fertilized egg won’t nestle into the endometrium properly.
Progesterone production slows down during perimenopause and menopause,
so you may have problems making a home for a fertilized egg.
Having periods doesn’t mean you’re fertile
Even for women in their prime baby-conceiving years, the planets need to be
aligned to get pregnant. But as you move into your perimenopausal years,
some months you ovulate, and some months you don’t. As time goes by, you
experience more and more cycles in which you don’t ovulate.
You may have a period even if you don’t ovulate.
Taking the good with the bad
There’s good news, and there’s bad news when the subject at hand is concep-
tion and the older woman. Because we don’t want you walking away from this
chapter on a down note, we start off this section with a few gloomy stats and
then turn our attention to the good stuff.
Around the time women hit the 35 to 38 mark (some experts say as early as
30), their fertility gradually declines, and it drops precipitously at 40.
Unfortunately, around this time, a woman’s risk of spontaneous miscarriage
begins to rise. By age 45, women have a 50-50 chance of suffering a sponta-
neous miscarriage if they conceive. Also, by the time women reach 45, the
risk of chromosomal abnormalities in the baby increases to 1 chance in 25. In
other words, for every 25 babies conceived by women 45 or older, one baby
has a chromosomal abnormality such as Down syndrome or spina bifida.
But there are also advantages to becoming a mom for the first time after
40.Women who have waited to have families are typically better prepared for
the sacrifices they need to make to nurture children. Establishing careers,
entertaining friends, travel, and other interests often preoccupy life during
your 20s and 30s. Now you may be more willing to make time to raise a
family, be better educated and more established in your career, and be on
solid financial ground.

And, hey, the perimenopausal symptom of interrupted sleep means that
you’ll probably already be awake when the baby cries. You and the newborn

wake up.

Mental and Emotional Issues
In This Chapter
 Differentiating between menopausal symptoms and emotional or mental changes
 Recognizing depression during menopause
 Remembering to read this chapter 
 Connecting hormones to mental and emotional stress
 Dealing with life changes
M
any of us have “senior moments” even before menopause. You know —
those brain hiccup moments when you’re about to introduce a friend
you’ve known for years and her name suddenly escapes you. Or maybe you
find yourself spending more time thinking about the hereafter as you walk
through the house — as in, “What am I here after?”
You’re not alone. Many women experience these mental lapses during peri-
menopause or menopause. Some women even experience this type of forget-
fulness long before menopause — during their menstrual cycle when
estrogen levels are at their lowest. Estrogen plays a major role in memory
and emotional functions.
Some perimenopausal and menopausal women also fall prey to emotional
rollercoaster rides (and sometimes your friends and family are taken along
for the ride). Fluctuating hormone levels prompt some emotional moments
(remember being a moody adolescent?); others can come as a response to
life events that — coincidentally — are more likely to occur at about the
same stage of life as menopause.
Then again, you may simply not experience many mental and emotional prob-
lems at all during perimenopause or menopause. Like PMS (premenstrual
syndrome), these symptoms are more severe in some women than others.
Some women just seem to be more sensitive to hormonal changes. In fact, if
you had memory lapses and heightened emotions in connection with your
menstrual cycle in the past, they may be part of your perimenopausal and
menopausal experience too.

In this chapter, we cover some of the symptoms you may be experiencing,
how they’re related to your hormones, and how you can tell if a symptom is
hormonal or psychological.
Understanding the Mental and Emotional
Stresses of Menopause
Fortunately, with 40 or 50 years of emotional experience behind you, you’re
most likely quite prepared to cope with the challenges life throws your way.
Midlife changes present you with plenty of new opportunities, but also with a
boatload of things that may be tough to handle.
If emotional issues or serious concerns about possible mental illness bother
you during these years, visit your medical advisor. Life events may certainly
trigger temporary mental or emotional issues, but there’s a difference
between a temporary mental state and a debilitating condition. If your emo-
tional state severely interferes with your daily life for a prolonged period of
time, ask your doctor for a referral to a therapist or counselor.
Finding the link to menopause
You have estrogen receptors all over your brain, particularly in areas associ-
ated with memory and mood, because your brain needs estrogen to function
properly. So, a dip in your estrogen levels can affect your mental and emo-
tional health. But medications, illness, and physical conditions other than
menopause can lead to mental and emotional problems. Ask your doctor to
help you tease out what’s going on. 
The medical establishment didn’t recognize hot flashes as an actual physical
condition (as opposed to whining) until the late 1970s. If going to the doctor
makes you feel as if you’ve stepped through a time warp into the 1950s (“It’s
all in your head. It’s just stress, dear. Go out and buy yourself something
pretty.”), then you, the patient, must take that bull by the horns (or by the
hormones), and make it clear to your medical advisor that you want him or
her to take the subject seriously. The symptoms caused by estrogen fluctua-
tions are at least as common in perimenopause as they are during
menopause itself. You may have to insist on a test to check your hormone
levels. And if you meet resistance, ask your friends for the name of a more
receptive doctor.

Part II: The Effects of Menopause on Your Body and Mind 

We’re sure you’ll be delighted to know that you can have perimenopausal
symptoms and PMS at the same time! Because so many of the symptoms are
the same, especially for women who have a hard time with PMS, it can be dif-
ficult to tell whether your moodiness, fatigue, headaches, and weight gain are
from your PMS or your perimenopause. Keeping a diary can help you tell —
PMS symptoms will be more regularly cyclical, occurring in the days or
weeks before your period. Perimenopausal symptoms are more unpre-
dictable and can occur at any point in your cycle. 
Separating menopausal symptoms 
from psychological disorders
The mental and emotional changes that you experience because of hormonal
changes shouldn’t interfere with your daily life — cause damage to friend-
ships or relationships with the folks at work, make it impossible to manage
your normal schedule of activities, or prompt you to abuse alcohol or drugs
to help you feel better. If your symptoms do provoke these changes, talk to
your doctor, seek out psychological help, or talk to your spiritual advisor. 
You typically experience symptoms of menopause over a limited period of
time, in episodes that come and go as your hormone levels fluctuate.
Although your loved ones may disagree, these symptoms don’t completely
alter your everyday life. They may make you occasionally unpleasant to be
around for a while, but they’re not debilitating or irreversible. On the other
hand, mental disorders do alter your everyday life.
Deciding Whether You’re Depressed
When we talk about the mental and emotional changes you may experience
during perimenopause and menopause, it’s important to distinguish between
these symptoms and the psychological disorders of the same name. For
example, some women experience periods of depression during menopause.
How do you know if you’re in trouble or if this is just a symptom you have to
deal with?
Understanding the differences
During perimenopause and menopause, experiencing episodes of sadness
isn’t unusual. During your younger days, you may have felt moody or blue for
a few days each month before your period. But most women in their 40s and
131
Chapter 10: Mental and Emotional Issues

50s have to deal with physiological changes (as they did when they were
younger) while they’re dealing with one or more items from a menu of life-
changing events: aging parents, the death of a loved one, marital problems,
empty nests, retirement, job loss, and maybe a few unfulfilled dreams.
A hormonal link between depression and menopause seems to exist. Like a
lot of issues that pop up at about the same time that your estrogen begins to
decline, however, this may (or may not) be another coincidence of timing.
Estrogen therapy, for instance, has not been found to be a good treatment for
depression. And after you’re fully into menopause and your fluctuating hor-
mone levels finally settle down, you may find your blues pack up and leave, too. 
This does not mean that any depression you’re feeling isn’t completely real.
Lots of things can cause depression, among them: 
 Hormonal imbalances: Shifting levels of estrogen and other hormones
can contribute to depression.
 Heredity: If you have a parent or other close relative who suffers from
depression, you are much more likely to experience it than is someone
with no family history of this problem.
 Gender: Women are twice as likely as men to have depression.
 Prescription medications: Depression can be a side effect of 
medication.
 Seasonal changes: Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a common prob-
lem, still not fully understood, in which lack of exposure to sunlight
during winter months seems to contribute to depression.
 Situational events: Depression can be triggered by loss or by major life
changes.
We all feel sad, dejected, or blue now and then. You may become upset when
you look in the mirror and see that your face has a few more wrinkles today
than it did last year. Or perhaps you haven’t yet won the Nobel Prize or pub-
lished that novel or climbed Mt. Everest. Or you may be in the midst of pro-
found mourning after the death of a loved one. Such sorrow may last for
several months. This is a completely normal response to a deeply felt emo-
tional loss. The major difference between sad feelings and a true major
depression is that sad feelings eventually pass — depression doesn’t.

Knowing the signs
Are you depressed? If you’re even asking yourself the question, it may be
time to speak with your doctor, but here are some signs that your sadness is
more than just a passing thing:
 Favorite things or activities no longer bring you pleasure
 Your patterns of eating, sleeping, or sexual activity have changed
 Everything seems as though it takes more effort than it used to
 You cry more than you used to or you don’t seem to feel much of 
anything
 You have thoughts about harming yourself
If these descriptions apply to you, talk to a doctor about whether you may be
suffering from clinical depression. People who seek help for their depression
are likely to find relief from medications or other treatments that can help
you to get a handle on depression and feel like yourself again.
Dealing with the Head Games
Your memory works because neurons (nerve cells) talk to each other across
special connectors in your brain. It’s normal for these cells to wear out over
time, but they’re also affected by the decreasing amount of estrogen available
in your body. Estrogen keeps your brain — like so many other systems in
your body — running smoothly. In the case of your brain, it plays a role in
stimulating the growth of new neural connectors, and also helps keep blood
vessels in the brain nicely dilated so that blood can flow through them with-
out interference. So, a decrease in estrogen makes your brain run, well, not
quite as smoothly as before. 
Knowing the symptoms
The mind games associated with menopause are tricky, and they come on
gradually — so gradually that you’re not sure whether you’ve always been
this way or if this is something new. You think you’re going crazy. Your brain
just doesn’t seem to be working the way it used to! Some of the symptoms
you may experience include
133
Chapter 10: Mental and Emotional Issues

 Fuzzy thinking: Having trouble staying focused at work? Do you feel as
though you’re walking around in a fog some days? Many women com-
plain of problems concentrating during perimenopause and menopause.
Shortened attention spans also seem to be associated with hormonal
change.
 Memory lapses: Not everyone experiences memory lapses, but if you
do, they can be annoying, even downright scary. Misplacing your purse
or temporarily forgetting how to spell a simple word is aggravating, but
not recognizing your husband or child is another story altogether. Just
because you occasionally experience this can’t-find-my-pencil type of
memory loss doesn’t mean that you have Alzheimer’s disease or that
you’re going to develop it.
There’s hardly anyone who doesn’t worry about Alzheimer’s when con-
fronted with a frustrating episode of minor memory loss. Remember — losing
your car keys, forgetting what you were about to say, or trying to use your
office key to unlock your front door at home are all examples of normal for-
getfulness. The time to worry is when you can’t remember how to drive your
car, suddenly don’t recognize the person you were talking to, or can’t figure
out how a key works. The old adage about memory is true, too: if you can
remember to worry about your memory, you’re most likely still okay. If those
around you are beginning to be concerned, it’s time to speak with your
doctor.
Looking at the research
Since the first edition of this book came out in 2003, the women’s health com-
munity has almost completely reversed its position on whether hormone
replacement therapy (HRT) is effective for maintaining sharp mental func-
tioning and preventing dementia after menopause. Remember how we said
that estrogen plays an important role in brain health? It really does, so for
years the conventional wisdom was that estrogen replacement would keep
your memory sharp and help to ward off Alzheimer’s.
But — go figure — the research findings of the Women’s Health Initiative
Memory Study don’t bear this out. Instead, this is what the long-term studies
of cognitive functioning and HRT have found so far:
 HRT (neither estrogen-alone nor combination therapy using estrogen
plus progestin) does not protect women from cognitive impairment
associated with aging.
 In fact, hormone therapy actually seems to increase the likelihood of
both general cognitive decline and the development of dementia.
134
Part II: The Effects of Menopause on Your Body and Mind 

As with any longitudinal study, research will continue and long-term findings
may be different. Findings may not apply in the same way to all women in all
groups, either — the WHI memory study, for instance, only looked at women
65 and over, so we can’t say with certainty what the findings mean for
younger women. For now, however, it doesn’t look as if seeking protection
from dementia or cognitive decline is a good reason to go on HRT. If you’re
already taking HRT, talk to your doctor about whether this is still the best
choice for you, and how long you ought to continue taking hormones. 
Beating the memory game
The least invasive (and very effective) ways to improve your memory during
and after menopause are also good for the rest of your health: Stick to a bal-
anced diet and exercise regularly. Also remember (no pun intended; well,
okay, it was intended) that your brain needs exercise too. Throughout your
life, you need to challenge and exercise your brain to keep those neurons
firing and to keep your memory from getting flabby and weak. Here are some
things you can do to help manage your memory:
 Check your thyroid and ovarian hormone levels. Checking your hor-
mone levels can help determine whether your symptoms are related to
menopause or whether you may have a more serious condition.
 Don’t smoke. As if you needed yet another reason to quit smoking, those
gray clouds suffocate the nerve cells as they restrict the amount of
oxygen that gets to your brain.
 Exercise your mental muscle. Do crossword puzzles or sudoku, read,
take a class, or try memorizing poems or recipes. Even just traveling,
trying new foods, or keeping interesting company helps to build new
neural connections and protect existing ones.
 Exercise your body. Get going! Walk or swim, climb mountains or do
yoga — just find something you love to do, and do it! Brisk aerobic activ-
ity three to five times a week for 30 minutes to an hour keeps the oxygen
flowing to your brain, which improves your memory and your mood.
 Get enough sleep. A loss of estrogen can cause disruptions in your
sleep. Whether your particular brand of sleep deprivation is due to
stress, urinary problems, low levels of estrogen, or your partner’s snor-
ing, it can do a number on your memory.
Be careful about using sleeping pills; they interrupt your normal sleep
patterns, which in turn, has a negative impact on your memory. You
should never use sleeping pills for more than two weeks in a row.
135
Chapter 10: Mental and Emotional Issues

 Limit your alcohol consumption. Consumed in excess, alcohol damages
nerve cells in the brain and depletes your body of vitamins necessary
for building neural connections. Ironically, though, a number of studies
show that moderate use of alcohol may actually help protect you from
dementia and senility.
 Take your vitamins. Certain vitamins help build nerve cells and the
neural connectors that you need to remember things (or to just plain
think). Some of the more important vitamins include
• B vitamins: This group includes vitamins B1, B2, B6, and B12, and
the lack of these can cause memory problems. You can find vita-
min B in meat, milk, and eggs, but if you’re vegan or vegetarian,
you can also find them in enriched flour, cereals, and wheat germ,
and in some enriched soy products. If you have a serious B vitamin
deficiency, your doctor may even prescribe vitamin B injections.
• Folic acid: Good news for veggie lovers, this B vitamin relative is
found primarily in vegetables rather than flour and meat. Green,
leafy vegetables, such as spinach, collard greens, kale, and broc-
coli, are rich in folic acid (but it’s also often added to enriched
breads and cereals, for those of you who still don’t like green
foods).
• Antioxidants: The antioxidants serve as rust protection for your
cells. Oxidation of your cells has a similar effect as oxidation of
metal (called rust) — it damages and eventually kills your cells.
Antioxidants include vitamins E and C, beta-carotene, and selenium.
Take a look at Chapter 18 to find out more about the importance of vitamins
during and after menopause. Most women require a multivitamin to get suffi-
cient dosages of these vitamins.
Straightening Out the Commotions 
with Your Emotions
As a woman, if you’re going to develop depression or an anxiety disorder in
your lifetime, it will most likely happen when you’re in your late 30s or early
40s. Is there a link between depression and menopause-related hormone
changes? More than likely. Aside from this fairly obvious coincidence in
timing, some physical characteristics of women with depression point to
lower levels of estrogen as a factor: Women with depression tend to have
lower estrogen levels, and their estrogen levels go up after they pull out of
the depression. Also, women with depression have lower bone density than
136
Part II: The Effects of Menopause on Your Body and Mind 

non-depressed women. Low bone density is another common byproduct of
low estrogen levels. Estrogen therapy, however, has not been found to be an
effective treatment for depression, so the exact nature of the link between
hormonal changes and an increase in emotional upsets, if one exists, still
isn’t well understood.
Feeling your way through the symptoms
Here are the emotional changes you may notice as you approach menopause:
 Anxiety: You’re driving along and all of a sudden you feel panicky. With
anxiety, you may experience both emotional and physical symptoms.
Emotionally you may be irritable or have trouble focusing. Physically,
your heart may start beating as though you’ve just sprinted a 50-yard
dash. You wonder if you should drive straight to the hospital. Heart pal-
pitations or a racing heart accompanied by butterflies in your stomach
are common during perimenopause and menopause.
137
Chapter 10: Mental and Emotional Issues
Connecting mental changes and thyroid function
The thyroid is a butterfly shaped gland in your
throat right in front of your larynx. It produces
the hormone thyroxin, which is responsible for
regulating the rate of oxidation in your body, but
it also has a profound effect on your moods and
your mental functioning. There are two basic
forms of thyroid disease: you can be hyperthy-
roid (in which the thyroid gland produces too
much thyroxin) or — and this is more common
in women, particularly as we age — hypothy-
roid (in which it produces too little). Both disor-
ders result in changes, usually subtle but
sometimes dramatic, in your overall health.
The kicker is that the symptoms of a thyroid
gland on the blink are remarkably similar to the
symptoms of menopause. Thyroid disease also
tends to occur, when it does, at about the same
point in your life as menopause. It’s under-
standable, therefore, that you might go through
menopause blaming your symptoms on estro-
gen depletion without ever knowing your thyroid
is behind some or all of your discomfort. Both
are associated with changes in skin, hair, men-
struation, and weight, with depression, insom-
nia, fatigue, mood swings, and memory
problems, and with anxiety, heart palpitations,
and loss of libido. 
At each checkup your doctor should palpate
(feel) your throat to check the size and shape of
the thyroid gland, but if you or she have con-
cerns about your symptoms she can also order
blood and other tests. She will also look for
symptoms that are common to thyroid dysfunc-
tion but not to menopause, such as tenderness
or pain in the throat, swelling in the arms or legs,
or loss of eyebrows and eyelashes. Treatment
will depend on whether your thyroid levels are
too high or too low, and on what your doctor
determines to be the cause of the malfunction.
Many thyroid problems are treated easily, effec-
tively, and inexpensively with oral medication.

 Depression: If you’re dealing with interrupted sleep, hot flashes, or
memory lapses, avoiding the blues is hard. If you experienced depression
related to PMS or if you had to deal with postpartum (after-childbirth)
depression, you’re more likely to experience depression during the
change (see more about depression earlier in this chapter, under
“Deciding Whether You’re Depressed”).
 Increased sensitivity: You may feel that life isn’t fair or that everything
is your fault, or you may find yourself looking for a fight. Performing at
any level that falls short of perfection can cause a negative emotional
reaction. Or you may experience crying jags — with or without reason.
 Mood swings: One minute everything is fine, and the next minute you’re
sad and gloomy. You may find it difficult dealing with family situations,
relationships at home, or professional relationships.
Understanding the physiology 
and getting relief
When estrogen levels drop, the hormone serotonin decreases. Serotonin
helps decrease anxiety, so when it drops, you tend to get more anxious.
When serotonin drops, it also aggravates adrenaline-inspired irritability and
heart palpitations in addition to anxiety. Your doctor may prescribe sero-
tonin-enhancing antidepressants to relieve anxiety during perimenopause
and menopause. SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) can balance
certain brain chemicals to help relieve the symptoms of depression. 
Keep in mind that, though these symptoms can be annoying, they aren’t actu-
ally dangerous. Anxiety and depression can also be treated without medica-
tion through acupuncture, counseling, biofeedback, yoga, relaxation, herbal
remedies, and massage. (See Chapter 17 for more information on alternative
therapies.) The decision to take antidepressant medication should be yours,
not your doctor’s. If you decide to take them, talk with your doctor about
possible side effects, and never stop taking them suddenly or change your
dosage without medical supervision.
SSRIs are also used to treat depression triggered by an imbalance between
estrogen and progesterone in your body. With estrogen levels lower during
perimenopause and menopause, progesterone can temporarily overpower
the effects of estrogen and testosterone in your brain. You may feel like
crying, or you may feel irritable, grumpy, or downright ugly.
Situational stress (not unfamiliar to women in their 40s and 50s) triggers
changes in ovarian function. Hormone production can then drop off, causing
even more emotional changes. Life events may start your mental and emo-
tional symptoms, but hormonal changes turn up the volume.
138
Part II: The Effects of Menopause on Your Body and Mind 

Managing life changes
Going through menopause might be a little easier if you could do it in a social
vacuum. You know, maybe take a nice stack of great books, a few bottles of
wine, and your favorite comfy clothes and hole up in the mountains (or at the
beach or in a luxury big city penthouse apartment — select your favorite sce-
nario) for, oh, say, three or four years. You might still have hot flashes and
night sweats and irregular periods, but the aggravation factor in your life
would be almost nil.
Instead, though, we all get to go through these life changes in the midst of a
crazy, busy world. Menopause seems to get plunked down into your life just
at the point at which you still have the concerns of a younger woman but are
also beginning to take on the roles of an older one. You might have children
still at home when you start taking care of your aging parents or in-laws.
Perhaps you’re simultaneously dreading and looking forward to having the
nest empty out just a bit. You might be wondering when your periods are
going to stop and your preteen daughter’s are going to start. And you may
have reached a position of new responsibility in your job — and here your
brains seem to be turning to oatmeal.
Whatever’s on your plate, it’s going to bring both stress (and, if you’re lucky)
and joy. Ups and downs. Mood swings and stretches of tranquility. In Chapter
20 we’ll talk a lot more about how the changing features of your life affect
(and are affected by) your menopause experience.

f you’re like most women, the barrage of news flashes
and special reports on hormone therapy that seem to
pop up a few times a year may leave your head spinning.
Flash: “Never take hormones.” Report: “Never stop taking
hormones.” Getting a handle on the risks and benefits of
hormone therapy can be challenging. In this part, we
attempt to demystify the subject, so that you’re in a posi-
tion to make informed decisions (with the assistance of
your medical advisor) about what approach to managing
symptoms is right for you.
In the chapters that follow, we present you with the 
latest information regarding hormone therapy and its 
relationship to your cardiovascular system, breast cancer,
your reproductive organs, your mental and emotional
health, and other health concerns. We also provide a
bunch of information on non-hormonal treatments (both
conventional treatments, such as medications, and non-
conventional routes like herbal therapy and acupuncture)
for many of the symptoms and conditions facing
menopausal women.

ormone therapy (HT) may not be right for everyone, but it definitely
can relieve many menopausal symptoms and prevent or postpone dis-
eases that afflict women later in life.
Many women are experimenting with hormone therapy to figure out the
types, combinations, and dosages that are right for them to maximize the pro-
tective effects of HT and minimize the risks. Some women swear by it. Some
women fear it. Some women do both. New research findings are announced
frequently — sometimes contradicting earlier ones. We make sense of these
findings in many chapters of this book, particularly in Chapter 16.
But many women still aren’t comfortable enough with their level of knowl-
edge about HT to make up their minds about where they stand on the sub-
ject. If you’re a member of this group, that’s okay. In this chapter, we explain
the various hormones and hormone therapy regimens and how they work.
Hormones are powerful, and you should understand what you put in your
body.
Defining Hormone Therapy
Hormone therapy is a program of estrogen or estrogen and progestin that are
administered to relieve menopausal symptoms. Doctors often prescribe hor-
mones during perimenopause (the years before menopause when women

experience many of the symptoms — hot flashes, sleeplessness, and so on —
associated with menopause). After menopause, you can gradually discon-
tinue use of hormone therapy. 
Physicians who recommend that hormone therapy continue after menopause
do so because it provides some protection against osteoporosis and relieves
urogenital atrophy (thinning and drying of your vagina or ureter) caused by
low levels of estrogen. In many women, the hormone boost also improves
mood and the sense of well being. You and your doctor can work together to
determine whether hormone therapy is right for you and how long you
should remain on it.
Some experts don’t like to include the term replacement when referring to
hormone therapy because replacement implies that a deficiency exists.
Producing lower levels of hormones isn’t a disease; it’s one of many natural,
normal transitions a woman’s body makes throughout her lifetime.
Women without a uterus (women who have had a hysterectomy) may take
estrogen by itself. When estrogen is used alone, it’s called unopposed estrogen
therapy because progestin isn’t included to oppose the effects of the estrogen.
From the 1950s through the 1970s, doctors routinely prescribed estrogen (the
female hormone responsible for giving you breasts, a curvy figure, a men-
strual period, and more) by itself to treat menopausal symptoms. As the inci-
dence of endometrial cancer in menopausal women climbed, researchers
noticed that menopausal women were more prone to endometrial cancer if
they were taking estrogen therapy. Researchers also found that if you also
take progesterone (the hormone that causes you to have a period and slough
off the endometrial lining during your reproductive years) for a few days, the
risk of endometrial cancer drops.
Here’s why the addition of progestin (the synthetic form of progesterone)
reduces the risk of endometrial cancer: Estrogen stimulates growth of the
endometrium (uterine lining) to make a nice soft nest for a fertilized egg. The
uterus is neatly designed to shed the endometrial lining if the egg isn’t fertil-
ized. That way you clean out the nest each cycle to get ready for the next
ovulation. Shedding the endometrium also serves another purpose because
an occasional precancerous cell may be located among the endometrial
lining. Stimulated growth month after month causes the occasional precan-
cerous cell to multiply along with the normal cells. If you don’t shed these
precancerous cells, you’re liable to develop endometrial cancer.
So researchers tried giving women progestin (the female hormone that
causes changes in the uterus) for a few days. Just like in a natural cycle,
when the progestin levels rise and then fall, the endometrial lining sheds —
getting rid of any precancerous cells.
144
Part III: Treating the Effects 

Menopausal women who don’t take hormone therapy and women who are
still menstruating (and shed their endometrial lining each month) rarely have
problems with endometrial cancer.
Taking estrogen without balancing (or opposing) it with progestin is referred
to as unopposed estrogen therapy (check out the section, “Unopposed estro-
gen therapy,” for more information). Women who’ve had a hysterectomy are
really the only women who should receive estrogen alone. Without a uterus
(which is removed during a hysterectomy), their chances of developing uter-
ine cancer drop to zero. For most other women who take hormone therapy, a
combination of estrogen and progesterone is necessary.
Slaying the symptoms
For some women, perimenopausal symptoms are so severe that they truly
interfere with their relationships, careers, self-esteem, or happiness.
Physicians have routinely prescribed hormone therapy to alleviate symp-
toms of perimenopause, such as hot flashes, vaginal dryness, disrupted
sleep, mood swings, and so on, and it works fabulously. (Check the Cheat
Sheet or Chapter 3 for a full rundown of perimenopausal and menopausal
symptoms.) Despite studies that suggest that there are health risks associ-
ated with hormone therapy, many women don’t want to go without hormone
therapy because perimenopausal symptoms threaten their enjoyment of life.
People around the world have developed alternative therapies to alleviate
the symptoms associated with perimenopause, and women in the Western
world have started to choose alternatives to traditional hormone therapy.
(Check out Chapter 17 for a rundown of alternative approaches.)
Preventing serious health problems
with hormone therapy
Thanks to improvements in nutrition and healthcare, women living in the
United States and Canada today may live into their 80s and 90s. Consider
this: In 1900, North American women could expect to live to the ripe old age
of 50 (barely into menopause). But today the average life span is about 80
years (way beyond menopause), so you’ve definitely got an incentive to live a
healthier lifestyle. And you may want to consider hormone therapy.
145
Chapter 11: The Basics of Hormone Therapy

Here’s why: Estrogen keeps the engine that is your body running smoothly,
and you’re going to be driving this car for quite some time (unlike the women
in historical times who only drove the car while it was new). Think about how
you maintain your car. It’s one thing to be a quart low on oil when you’re dri-
ving a couple miles to the grocery store. But taking a 2,000-mile trip when
you’re down a quart of oil is a completely different story. Your engine will
burn up long before you reach the end of your journey. You may want to
intervene with medicine even when you’re not sick to keep your body run-
ning smoothly.
The health problems standing in the way of staying active and comfortable
are related to the fact that women produce lower levels of estrogen after
becoming menopausal — which can be 30, 40, or more years of your life. Low
levels of estrogen are associated with such health issues as:
 Osteoporosis
 Hardening of the arteries
 Heart disease (including heart attack and angina)
 Increased risk of some cancers
 Memory changes
Preventing some of these debilitating diseases and conditions is one of the
reasons women have traditionally elected to take hormone therapy. Now that
recent research indicates that hormone therapy is not as effective at dealing
with some of these problems as originally thought (and may even make some
of them worse — we’ll talk more about this later in this and the next few
chapters), it’s especially important to sort out exactly what’s right for you. 
Studies such as the Women’s Health Initiative also emphasize that whatever
you decide to do about hormone therapy, it’s critical that you also choose a
healthy lifestyle that includes frequent exercise, a healthy diet, and regular
medical checkups. 
Ticking Through the Therapies
Every woman’s body is different, and you can choose from a variety of regi-
mens and many different types of hormones. We know that trying to get a
handle on all the available hormones and therapies on the ever-changing
market can be overwhelming. So, in this section, the goal is to help you
understand the different types of treatment programs women use and why
they use them.
146
Part III: Treating the Effects 

Estrogen plays such a large role in so many of your body’s functions that
compensating for the decreased production levels that menopause brings is
a key component of most hormone therapies.
During menopause and beyond, the perimenopausal symptoms generally
begin to subside, and the bigger concern is preventing, delaying, or treating
health issues such as bone loss, cancer, and upwardly mobile blood choles-
terol levels.
Unopposed estrogen therapy
Unopposed estrogen therapy refers to a treatment program in which you
receive only estrogen without any form of progesterone.
Doctors only use unopposed estrogen if you have no uterus (you’ve had a
hysterectomy) because taking estrogen without progestin can lead to
endometrial cancer.
Blood-clotting problems are associated with high dosages of estrogen. If you
smoke and take estrogen, your risk is even higher. Some evidence shows that
the estradiol form of estrogen may be less likely to contribute to blood clots
than the conjugated types of estrogen. Because patches don’t send estrogen
to the liver where it stirs up trouble, they may also lower the risk of clotting.
Even so, be sure your doctor is aware of any personal or family history you
may have of clotting disorders before you use any estrogen products.
If you have an existing problem with liver or gallbladder disease, discuss
these conditions with your doctor before using any type of estrogen. Patients
with uncontrolled blood pressure shouldn’t start on high doses of estrogen.
You should also inform your doctor of any history of diabetes, breast cancer,
endometriosis or fibroid uterine tumors, pancreatitis, or vaginal bleeding.
Treatment methods
Your doctor will evaluate your symptoms and hormone levels to establish an
appropriate dosage. You may take an estrogen pill every day or use a patch
that you apply to your abdomen once or twice a week (the exact timing
depends on the brand and your doctor’s recommendations). Creams you
apply to your skin (like you apply a moisturizer) are also available.
Benefits
Taking unopposed estrogen boosts the amount of estrogen circulating in your
bloodstream. This boost alleviates a variety of symptoms including:
147
Chapter 11: The Basics of Hormone Therapy

 Headaches: Estrogen increases blood flow by relaxing blood vessels.
 Hot flashes, heart palpitations, and anxiety: A drop in estrogen triggers
your brain to release adrenaline, which makes your heart race and your
blood vessels dilate.
 Interrupted sleep: This state of affairs is often the result of hot flashes.
Estrogen alleviates hot flashes and increases serotonin production, so
you’re able to sleep through the night. 
 Mood swings and irritability: Estrogen increases serotonin production.
 Vaginal dryness and atrophy, frequent urination, and urinary inconti-
nence: Estrogen acts as a moisturizer to your urogenital tissues, keeping
them pliable enough to avoid these problems.
Taking unopposed estrogen also eliminates the premenstrual-symptom-like
side effects of bloating, breast tenderness, and similar symptoms caused 
by progesterone. Taking unopposed estrogen also seems to help prevent 
fractures.
Recent research, however, finds that estrogen therapy is not helpful in pre-
venting many of the problems it was previously associated with relieving.
New findings, for example, indicate that it increases your risk of blood clots,
heart attack, and stroke.
Side effects
If you take estrogen alone without progesterone or progestin, you won’t 
have periods after menopause as you would with combination hormone 
therapy (see the “Combination therapy” section later in this chapter). Your
endometrium (lining of your uterus) will continue to thicken and create quite
a buildup. The buildup can lead to endometrial (uterine) cancer. 
Another side effect of estrogen includes breast fullness or tenderness. This side
effect can often be reduced or eliminated by decreasing the dosage or switching
from the pill form of estrogen to an estradiol (active estrogen) skin patch.
Sometimes side effects reflect a reaction to a dye or some inert (inactive)
ingredient in an estrogen tablet and can be eliminated by switching from the
pill to the patch. These side effects may include joint aches, muscle aches,
skin irritation, and a burning sensation that accompanies urination. Skin irri-
tation can also be a side effect of patch use.
Cautions
Have a uterus? Don’t use unopposed estrogen therapy (because of the risk of
endometrial cancer). If you have a history of breast cancer or you’re experi-
encing undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, your physician won’t prescribe unop-
posed estrogen therapy even if you’ve had a hysterectomy. If you only have a
family history of breast cancer, talk with your doctor about whether unop-
posed estrogen is an option for you. 
148
Part III: Treating the Effects 

Stay away from estrogen therapy if you’re pregnant.
Combination therapy
Combination therapy means taking a combination of hormones instead of just
estrogen. Combination therapy typically consists of a combination of estro-
gen and progesterone (or the synthetic form of progesterone called prog-
estin). Some women who experience low libido also take a small dose of
testosterone in their “hormone cocktail.”
Combining progesterone with estrogen provides the benefits of estrogen
while reducing the risk of endometrial cancer that taking unopposed estro-
gen can heighten. The only bad part is that progestin/progesterone may
slightly reduce some of the benefits of estrogen. The sole purpose for includ-
ing progestin in hormone therapy is to reduce your risk of endometrial
cancer. If you have a uterus and you elect hormone therapy, your doctor will
put you on some form of combination hormone therapy. 
Treatment methods
Choosing combination therapy gives you several options, as long as your
medical history doesn’t rule it out. Combination hormone therapy comes in
two basic forms: cyclic and continuous combination therapy. And cyclical
combination therapy has a few different options you can choose from. Each
form has its own set of indications that make it the right choice. 
 Cyclic combination therapy: With this form, you’re taking estrogen and
progestin in a cycle — estrogen in the first part and progestin in the
second. The progestin tells your uterus to shed the endometrial lining,
so you’ll have periods.
“But I thought menopause meant that you don’t have a period,” you say
(with justifiable indignation). Okay, you’re not technically having a men-
strual period; you’re having vaginal bleeding. Drugs, not ovulation, trig-
ger this bleeding. Cyclic hormone therapy causes most women to have
predictable vaginal bleeding, sometimes for years.
There are two common cyclic combination programs:
• In one, you take estrogen every day of the month and estrogen and
progestin together for the last 10 to 14 days of every cycle.
• In the other cyclic combination regimen, you take estrogen every
day for 25 days of the month and progestin for 10 to 12 days, then
no medication for 3 to 6 days each month (expect bleeding on
these days). Some people refer to this regimen as sequential combi-
nation therapy because you take the estrogen and progestin in a
sequence.
149
Chapter 11: The Basics of Hormone Therapy

 Continuous combination therapy: With this form of therapy, you take
estrogen and progestin together every day. This approach is associated
with these benefits:
• Lower risk of endometrial cancer
• Cessation of periods after six months or a year
• Slightly reduced risk of colorectal cancer
• Fewer fractures
• A slightly diminished risk of mild cognitive impairment
• Fewer progestin-related side effects in some women (see the fol-
lowing “Side effects” section), especially bleeding
Pills and patches on the market today combine the two hormones, making
them easy to take. But some women who are sensitive to progestin experience
fewer side effects when using a progestin cream and taking estrogen as a pill
or patch. If you’re bothered by side effects, talk with your doctor about experi-
menting with different dosages or forms to make you more comfortable.
Some women on combination therapy don’t like the side effects they feel on
the days they take progesterone. Don’t stop taking progesterone/progestin
without consulting your doctor, and take it for the exact length of time pre-
scribed by your doctor. Taking estrogen without progestin/progesterone can
lead to endometrial cancer. (For more information, see the “Unopposed estro-
gen therapy” section earlier in this chapter.)
Certain progestins are derived from testosterone and can help women who
complain of low libido (sex drive) during and after menopause. The generic
name for this progestin is norethindrone. Although norethindrone reduces
many of the progestin side effects, it’s not recommended for women with
high LDL-cholesterol or triglyceride levels. Like estrogen, you can take testos-
terone via creams, regular pills, pills that dissolve under your tongue, and
vaginal suppositories. Doctors most commonly prescribe low-dosage skin
creams and pills because these forms cause your body to absorb the testos-
terone more slowly, helping you avoid side effects caused by rapid shifts in
your hormone levels.
Benefits
Combination therapy should give you the best of all worlds — the benefits of
estrogen (and perhaps testosterone) without the risks of endometrial cancer.
Continuous hormone therapy causes fewer side effects in older women (sev-
eral years beyond menopause) than in younger women. Continuous hormone
therapy also causes fewer PMS-type symptoms than cyclic hormone therapy
does. The good news for those of you who are tired of tampons is that one-
third of women stop bleeding when they start the continuous combination
150
Part III: Treating the Effects 

therapy, many others stop monthly bleeding after two to three months, and
most have stopped monthly bleeding after one year of therapy. Another
bonus: women who have problems with their libido often find that a bit of
testosterone in their hormone mix gives it a boost. 
Side effects
Some women have a hard enough time tolerating either human progesterone
or synthetic progestin. Proper dosages and delivery forms can help to curb
the side effects of progestin, which can include acne, bloating, depression,
and weight gain. 
Cautions
Women with a history of breast cancer should not take hormone therapy, and
those with a family history of breast cancer should seek their doctors’
advice. Women who have heart disease, uncontrolled diabetes, high blood
pressure, high triglyceride levels, fibromyalgia, or depression should make
sure their doctors are aware of their history of these conditions before they
prescribe a specific HT regimen.
Contrary to what researchers believed just a few years ago, combination
therapy does not prevent coronary artery disease or reduce the risk of heart
attack. Recent women’s Health Initiative findings show that combination ther-
apy users are at increased risk of
 Heart attack
 Stroke
 Blood clots
 Breast cancer
 Dementia (study included only women 65 and older) 
Selective Estrogen Receptor 
Modulators (SERMs)
Meet the stealth bombers of the hormone therapy world. SERMs are manu-
factured designer drugs that provide the benefits of estrogen to specific parts
of the body while blocking its effects in parts of the body it has the potential
to harm (your breasts and uterus, for instance). SERMs don’t contain estro-
gen itself, but they act to stimulate estrogen receptors where the effects of
estrogen are desired, and to block its effects where they aren’t wanted. The
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved two SERMs for use in
the United States:
151
Chapter 11: The Basics of Hormone Therapy

 Tamoxifen: Though it was designed to prevent further recurrence for
women with a history of specific types of breast cancer, research
showed that Tamoxifen is also effective at improving bone density.
 Raloxifene: Approved by the FDA for treatment and prevention of osteo-
porosis, Raloxifene also seems to be associated with a decrease in the
incidence of breast cancer among its users.
A breast cancer drug that’s effective against osteoporosis and an osteoporo-
sis medication that’s effective against breast cancer? The need to find the one
most effective drug led to a showdown of sorts — but in the Study of
Tamoxifen and Raloxifene (STAR), sponsored by the National Cancer Institute
and other groups, and not in the OK Corral. Recently STAR began releasing
findings from their two-year study comparing the effectiveness of these two
drugs. It’s likely that more results will trickle in, but the main findings so far
indicate that
 Both drugs cut breast cancer risk in half.
 Study participants who took Raloxifene had 39 percent fewer uterine
cancers than those taking Tamoxifen.
 Both drugs increased the risk of blood clots, but Raloxifene users had 29
percent fewer blood clots than Tamoxifen users.
 Both drugs were equally effective at preventing bone fractures.
 Both are associated with menopausal side effects, but Raloxifene takers
experienced fewer of these. 
Treatment methods
Both Tamoxifen and Raloxifene are available in pill form and should be taken
as directed by your physician. 
Benefits
SERMs may reduce bone loss in menopausal women, but not as well as estrogen.
SERMs reduce the risk of breast cancer in women if taken for no more than
five years. Unlike combination hormone therapy, SERMs have no negative
effects on blood lipids, so they won’t raise your triglyceride or LDL-cholesterol
levels.
A lot of research is still ongoing, and new types of SERMs are on their way.
Targeting specific estrogen receptors for enrichment seems to be a very
promising way to help women stay comfortable and healthy during and after
menopause.
152
Part III: Treating the Effects 

Side effects
Unfortunately, SERM use brings some side effects, but STAR found fewer of
these with Raloxifene:
 Insomnia
 Slight increased risk of endometrial cancer (with Tamoxifen)
 Significant hot flashes
SERMs are beneficial to your blood cholesterol, but they do increase the risk
of blood clots in your veins and lungs and may lead to strokes.
Cautions
Anyone at risk of cardiovascular problems should avoid SERMs. Also note
that if you have hot flashes, SERMs have the potential to make them worse. 
Prescribing Pills, Patches, and Pomades
Over the years, scientists have worked hard to provide hormone therapy that
maximizes the benefits and minimizes the side effects and inconveniences.
Basically, you have three hormone therapy paths to choose: your mouth
(pill), skin (patch or cream), or vagina (cream, gel, or ring). 
In the following sections, we list the types of delivery systems available and
the benefits and drawbacks of each. We also go through the different types of
hormones used in hormone therapy one by one and indicate how they can be
delivered. You and your doctor can experiment to find the delivery methods
and dosages that are most effective for you.
Popping pills
Taking pills by mouth is the easiest and most traditional way of taking medi-
cine. Getting the exact dose that the doctor ordered is also simple because
the prescribed dosage is already loaded in the pill; plus the frequency is writ-
ten on the label. For older women who may already be taking several medica-
tions, an additional pill in the parade can be a pain. 
Pasting on a patch
Patches deliver drugs that are absorbed through the skin. In the old days
(five or six years ago), the alcohol in the original bulky patches often caused
153
Chapter 11: The Basics of Hormone Therapy

skin irritation. In today’s thinner, smaller matrix patches the hormone is actu-
ally incorporated in the adhesive that holds it on.
Patches have some significant advantages:
 You put them on once or twice a week.
 They deliver a steady and consistent supply of hormone.
 They’re easier on your liver and digestive tract than pills are because
the medication they release bypasses these areas of your body and goes
straight into your bloodstream.
Exposure to heat can increase the amount of medication released by your
patch (leaving less for later). Doctors don’t recommend exposing it to direct
sunlight (or tanning lamps) or hot environments such as saunas or hot tubs. 
Location, location, location. You may experience different results depending
on where you apply the cream or wear the patch. If your patch falls off, or if
you have bad side effects, talk to your doctor about using a different location
(for example, hip instead of abdomen) before trying a different medication.
Because HT has been associated with an increase in the risk of heart disease,
a five-year study was launched in 2005 at eight medical centers in the United
States to look at whether delivery of HT by patch, rather than in pill form, is
less likely to contribute to cardiac problems. The study, called Kronos Early
Estrogen Prevention Study (KEEPS), will follow younger perimenopausal and
menopausal women than those being followed by the Women’s Health
Initiative. 
Applying creams 
Vaginal lining responds very quickly to treatments applied directly to the
area as a remedy for dryness or atrophy. Some women like vaginal creams
because they deliver the hormones localized in a small area. They won’t,
however, treat your hot flashes, mood swings, bones, or blood cholesterol. 
If you’re treating vaginal dryness or atrophy yet worry about breast or
endometrial cancer, a cream may be a good choice, even though its measure-
ment may be somewhat imprecise. For example, an estrogen cream relieves
vaginal dryness and atrophy but doesn’t increase your risk of breast cancer
because the dosage is low and the estrogen stays put. Vaginal estrogen sup-
positories or tablets are another option. These are neater than creams, easy
to insert, and give a precise dose. You insert them high into the vagina with
an applicator similar to one you’d use for a tampon, only narrower. 
154
Part III: Treating the Effects 

Don’t expose a male sexual partner to the medication in hormone creams or
suppositories. The active ingredients can be absorbed through the skin of his
penis. Don’t use them right before intercourse. Also, some estrogen creams
contain oils that can weaken latex condoms. 
A compounding pharmacy is one that will make up prescriptions in a custom-
tailored dosage (stronger or weaker), formula (a cup of estrogen, a few tea-
spoons of progestin, a pinch of testosterone), or form (cream, gel, even —
though probably not for HT — lollipops or gummy bears). If you just can’t find
the right balance of hormones to keep your risk low and your symptoms at
bay, talk to your doctor about working with a compounding pharmacy to make
up just the right prescription for you. Though not regulated by the Food and
Drug Administration, these are closely regulated by individual states. If there’s
not one near you, ask your doctor to recommend one who does mail order.
Slipping on a ring
This ring doesn’t go on your finger; you place it in your vagina. Rings are
fairly new in the United States, but women in Europe have been using them
for quite a while to address vaginal and urinary symptoms of menopause.
The doctor usually inserts the flexible, hormone-containing ring initially; after
that you can change it — usually every 90 days. The ring slowly delivers an
even supply of hormones to your bloodstream.
Don’t worry: The ring won’t get in your way during sex. But some women do
have a problem tolerating the ring because they have short or narrow vagi-
nas. Also, you can pop it out if you’re straining on the potty. But, if you’re
okay with a diaphragm, the ring isn’t that much different.
A ring is a great option for women with vaginal and urinary tract menopausal
symptoms, but it doesn’t provide all the other health benefits of estrogen
such as relief of perimenopausal symptoms and improved bone maintenance.
The ring’s risk factors for endometrial cancer have not been systematically
compared with those of other estrogen-delivery methods. The Food and Drug
administration, though, warns that this may be a risk if you still have a uterus. 
155
Chapter 11: The Basics of Hormone Therapy
Rejecting injections 
Although hormones are available in a fourth
form (all other forms are described in the sec-
tion, “Prescribing Pills, Patches, and Pomades,”
earlier in this chapter), as shots, they’re not
used in routine hormone therapy. Physicians
generally prescribe hormone shots just prior to
surgery for patients who are about to have their
ovaries taken out. Injections keep the hormone
levels in the patient’s bloodstream from crash-
ing after the surgery.

Searching for Sources
For those of you who like to exchange recipes, here’s a quick overview about
how drug companies make these hormones. In the following sections, you
can see that those folks in white lab coats have been very resourceful in find-
ing ways to create hormones.
Synthetic versus natural hormones
Deciding what’s natural when it comes to hormone therapy can be difficult.
Like beauty, natural (hormone therapy) is in the eye of the beholder. You can
look at natural a couple of ways:
 Natural can mean similar to what you already have in your body. In the
laboratory, scientists can replicate the exact molecular structure of
human hormones. The results are identical to human hormones but
without the stray bits that exist in all animal hormones. So these hor-
mones have the same structure as natural human hormones, but they’re
made in a lab, so they’re synthetic.
 Natural can also mean coming from nature (you know, plants and ani-
mals). Some hormones are derived from plants but need to be modified
to produce a beneficial effect in our bodies. Other hormones come from
animals. So, these natural hormones come from nature, but they’re not
natural to humans.
So, natural isn’t really a good term for describing the hormones used for hor-
mone therapy. In the next section, we give you the source of the hormone —
you get to decide whether you consider it natural or not.
Estrogen
Some really clever scientists have found a variety of sources from which to
make estrogen. Over the years, trying to get the right type and amount of
estrogen into your body has been quite a challenge for the guys and gals in
lab coats.
Before we get started with the recipes for hormone therapy, a quick reminder
about the ins and outs of estrogen may be in order. Three types of estrogen
exist: estrone, estradiol, and estriol. We mention this fact because all types of
estrogen are not created equal. Here’s a brief estrogen primer (the whole
story is in Chapter 2):
156
Part III: Treating the Effects 

 Estradiol is the biologically active type of estrogen and the most potent
form of human estrogen. It’s a player in hundreds of bodily functions.
 Estrone isn’t the workhorse that estradiol is; estrone is more like the
warehouse variety of estrogen that’s stored in your body fat. It can be
turned into estradiol, but only in premenopausal ovaries.
 As for estriol, fuggetaboutit — in this context anyway. Estriol is mostly
found in pregnant women.
All right. Now that that’s taken care of, here are the sources of estrogen that
scientists have come up with:
 Conjugated equine estrogen: Made from the urine of pregnant horses. (If
you’re a vegan or lean toward animal rights activism, this one might not
be right for you.) Some of the most-prescribed estrogens used in hormone
therapy are conjugated equine estrogens. This type of estrogen has the
least amount of estradiol, but it delivers lots of estrone and a significant
amount of equilin, an estrogen used by horses. Although equilins are great
for female horses, doctors occupy both sides of the fence on the subject
of whether equilin is beneficial to human females. Conjugated equine
estrogen is available in pill, injection, and cream form.
 Estradiol estrogen: Derived from soybeans and/or wild yams. These
estrogens are chemically identical to human estradiol estrogen. Estradiol
estrogen is available in every delivery method — pill, cream, ring, and
patch. (Check out the “Prescribing Pills, Patches, and Pomades” section
earlier in this chapter for more info.) In fact, it’s the only type of estrogen
used in the patch.
 Esterified estrogen: Made from soybeans and/or wild yams (sometimes
referred to as Mexican yams). Esterified estrogen provides high levels of
estrone and much lower levels of estradiol estrogen, but it has been
shown to help maintain bone and improve perimenopausal symptoms
and lipid profiles in the blood. Esterified estrogen is available as a pill.
 Estropipate: Also known as piperazine estrogen sulfate. Available as a pill
or cream, this synthetic form of estrogen is chemically similar, but not
identical, to human estrone. A drawback of estropipate: It may actually
aggravate pain in women who have muscle- or bladder-pain syndromes.
 Micronized estradiol: Micronization means that the particles are small
enough to be absorbed into your bloodstream before your digestive
system destroys them. So here we go with the “What’s natural and
what’s not?” discussion. Micronized estradiol is made from a “natural”
plant, but technicians tweak it in the lab so that your body can use it.
You take this estradiol as a pill. Provides women with the same type of
active estrogen (estradiol) that the ovaries produce naturally. The estra-
diol is produced synthetically (in the lab) from soybeans.
157
Chapter 11: The Basics of Hormone Therapy

Some doctors claim that using a form of estrogen that’s molecularly sim-
ilar to human estradiol is no more beneficial to women than estrogen
products derived from pregnant mares; others claim that it makes all the
difference in the world.
Progestin
Most of the side effects attributed to hormone therapy are the result of the
progestin, but progestin protects you from developing endometrial cancer.
Because every woman’s body is different, you may need to do some experi-
menting to figure out which progestin is right for you.
Adding progestin to the hormone therapy mix does seem to reduce the bene-
fits estrogen can have on your cholesterol levels and increase changes to
your mood.
There are three types of progestin on the market:
 Progesterone: Identical to the human hormone produced by the ovary
in premenopausal women. Progesterone is available as a pill and as a
vaginal gel.
 Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA): Originally used to regulate men-
strual cycles. Doctors now prescribe it in hormone therapy to slough off,
or thin, the endometrial lining at the end of a course of estrogen, thereby
reducing the risk of endometrial cancer.
 Progestin derived from testosterone: Includes norethindrone and
norethindrone acetate progestin. They seem to have fewer side effects
than MPA and offer a boost to the libido in some women. These prog-
estins aren’t recommended for women with high cholesterol or low HDL
(the “good” cholesterol) levels. Norethindrone and norethindrone
acetate are available either as pills or patches.
Combinations of estrogen and progestin
For the sake of convenience, you may want to combine estrogen and prog-
estin into a single pill or patch.
A couple brands on the market combine conjugated estrogen with a prog-
estin called medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). The U.S. Food and Drug
Administration approved MPA for women having trouble with their periods.
MPA helps prevent the endometrium (uterine lining) from thickening too
158
Part III: Treating the Effects 

much and helps regulate periods. Because it inhibits over-thickening of your
endometrium, MPA can lower your risk of endometrial cancer.
Conjugated estrogen and MPA is a commonly prescribed combination ther-
apy and can be administered as either sequential courses of estrogen fol-
lowed by progestin or as continuous combination therapy (see the
“Combination therapy” section earlier in this chapter).
Today, new combination therapies use a progestin derived from testosterone,
norethindrone acetate, instead of MPA because it causes less vaginal bleeding.
You can get a combination therapy in both patch and pill forms. The combi-
nation patch administers the estradiol form of estrogen and norethindrone
acetate. Many women like the patch because you don’t have to remember to
take a pill and it’s convenient to have both hormones delivered in a single
patch.
Androgens
When we talk about androgens (male hormones), we’re mainly talking about
testosterone.
You may need to include androgens (most likely testosterone) in your hor-
mone therapy for a couple of reasons. If you’ve become menopausal due to
surgery (removal of your ovaries), your androgens may take a nosedive very
quickly. You may want to bump your androgens up because they help bone
maintenance and libido. Women who experience natural menopause may
need androgens in the regimen because estrogen supplements may decrease
the amount of physiologically active testosterone in your bloodstream
(which could lower your libido and lessen muscle tone).
Using too high a dose of testosterone has some side effects: acne, oily skin,
hair loss, unwanted hair, and a deeper voice. Rest assured that prescribed
dosages are rarely high enough to trigger these side effects.
Doing the Dosing
The guideline that every doctor uses is this: Use the smallest dose possible
to alleviate symptoms and health risks while minimizing the side effects. That
said, individual women react to hormone supplements very differently. No
one knows why a particular regimen causes one woman to experience side
effects and another to sing its praises from the rooftop. Hormone therapy
should be an ongoing process, and a responsible doctor will work with you to
find the dosage that works for you.
159
Chapter 11: The Basics of Hormone Therapy

Your doc will review your personal medical history, your family medical his-
tory, and the results of your physical examination and lab work. He’ll also
want to consider what conditions or problems you’re trying to overcome or
prevent. (For example: Are we talking about lessening perimenopausal symp-
toms or preventing osteoporosis after menopause? Could your libido use a
little boost?) Share your personal preferences and prejudices with your
doctor at this time as well. (Do you have a hard time swallowing pills? Do you
forget to take medicine? Are you determined to turf the tampons as soon as
possible? These kinds of issues.) Convenience and cost are also legitimate
issues to raise.
So just how much active estrogen do you need pulsing through your body to
keep you healthy and comfortable for the years to come? With new informa-
tion from the Women’s Health Initiative about the potential risks of hormone
therapy — particularly for women over 65 — many doctors are prescribing
hormones for shorter periods (no pun intended) than they used to, but every
case is different. You and your doctor may conclude that continuing hor-
mones for some years will be beneficial enough for you to outweigh any risk
factors you have.
If you have issues with your libido, your doctor takes it into the equation
when prescribing hormone therapy. Convenience is also an issue.
Convenience considerations include how many other medications you take
(do you really want to take more pills or use a patch), the cost, and how anx-
ious you are to quit bleeding every month. As far as the last issue goes,
sequential/cyclical therapy (taking estrogen for part of the month and prog-
estin another part of the month) results in continuing your periods for some
time, but continuous combination therapy (taking both estrogen and progestin
at the same time every day) generally stops your periods. SERMs also elimi-
nate your periods.

Understanding Hormone Therapy
and Your Heart
In This Chapter
 Recognizing the contribution of each hormone
 Brushing up on how hormones keep your cardiovascular system healthy
 Discovering the latest research on hormone therapy, your blood vessels, and your heart
U
ntil the results of the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) study were
released early in 2002, most medical folks thought that the one cer-
tainty in hormone therapy (HT) was the benefits it brought to your heart.
Although there’s still no question that the estrogen produced naturally in
your body lowers your risk of heart disease and keeps your blood cholesterol
healthy during your reproductive years, HT (which doesn’t use precisely the
same type of estrogen your body naturally produces) turns out not be the
cure-all for menopausal women that most experts had hoped it would be.
You need to take cardiovascular issues seriously. Whether you’re talking
about stroke, high blood pressure, or heart attack, more women die of cardio-
vascular disease than men do.
This chapter shows you the risks and benefits of hormone therapy as it
affects your cardiovascular system. We also take you through the major find-
ings of the Women’s Health Initiative and other large studies of heart health
as they apply to menopausal women. With this info in hand, you can make
better long-term decisions about how to cope with cardiovascular risks that
increase with age, and how to live a healthy life now and in the future. (But,
before you make any decisions, check out the other HT chapters in this book,
too — Chapter 11 and Chapters 13 through 17.)

Meeting the Players: Hormones
and Your Heart
It seems appropriate that your own natural sex hormones should play a role
in keeping your heart healthy. The jobs they do in your cardiovascular
system before menopause aren’t so different from the ones they play else-
where in your body. They keep you supple, strong, and vigorous, so it makes
sense that they’ll do the same in promoting heart health. 
The star: Estrogen
Because estrogen protects the cardiovascular system, women have about a
ten-year grace period for developing heart disease when compared to men. In
fact, most of the cardiovascular benefits attributed to hormone therapy are
due to the protective nature of estrogen:
 Keeps triglycerides low, and increases HDL (“good”) cholesterol
 Keeps fibrinogen, a protein which can cause blood clots, at healthy
levels 
 Relaxes artery walls to help dilate blood vessels, improve blood flow,
and avoid spasms 
 Reduces the buildup of plaque in your coronary arteries
 Helps prevent dangerous enlargement of the heart
For years hormone therapy — at first just estrogen, and later on, estrogen
with progesterone, to mimic your natural hormonal cycle — was routinely
prescribed for women. Hormone therapy was given not only to limit
menopausal symptoms, but also with the idea that it will keep your heart
strong and healthy. Doctors eventually figured out that estrogen can be a
tricky thing to replace, though. It serves up a few pretty serious potential
side effects along with its benefits. These can include
 Blood clots (deep-vein thrombosis) at high levels
 Increased triglyceride levels (when given as a pill)
 Uterine cancer, in women with a uterus
Continually reviewing your hormone-therapy regimen throughout your life is
very important. Your health conditions can change, which may lead you to
make a change in your program. 
162
Part III: Treating the Effects 

The supporting actor: Progesterone
Progesterone’s main function is to prepare your body for pregnancy. When
progesterone levels peak, most women feel bloated and ravenously hungry.
Your breasts often feel tender and enlarged. If your egg isn’t fertilized, proges-
terone levels drop, you have your period, and these symptoms go away.
With all the uncomfortable symptoms progesterone causes, why in the world
should anyone knowingly take this hormone after they finally rid their sys-
tems of it? Doctors have added progestin — synthetic progesterone — to
nearly all HT programs to lower the risk of endometrial cancer. (Women who
have their uterus surgically removed don’t receive progestin because they no
longer have to worry about uterine cancer, so they can take estrogen alone,
or unopposed estrogen.)
Although progestin reduces the risk of endometrial cancer, it has some nega-
tive effects on your cardiovascular system. In particular, progestin
 Lowers HDL (“good” cholesterol) levels.
 Increases triglycerides (very-low-density lipid — nearly all fat).
 Lowers your sensitivity to insulin, which affects your ability to process
glucose. This effect is of great concern to diabetics.
 Tends to make women’s bodies store fats instead of breaking them
down.
The assistant: Testosterone
Women’s bodies naturally produce testosterone, a so-called male hormone.
When given with estradiol (the active form of estrogen), testosterone helps to
relax and dilate the blood vessels, improving the flow of blood. If testos-
terone is given on its own with no estradiol, it seems to have the opposite
effect, promoting plaque buildup on vessel walls. Testosterone is tricky stuff,
so if you’re taking it, ask your doctor to keep an eye on your blood choles-
terol and modify treatment as needed.
Understanding the Difference Between
Hormones and Hormone Therapy
The Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) study, the one that stirred the HT debate
early in 2002, recruited over 160,000 volunteers to make sure the study’s find-
ings would be applicable to a wide range of women. The WHI put together
four large studies, one of them specifically about hormones. 
163
Chapter 12: Understanding Hormone Therapy and Your Heart

The WHI researchers focused their look at hormones on two clinical trials:
one on unopposed estrogen (remember, that’s estrogen all by its lonesome,
with no progestin), and one in which participants took conjugated equine
estrogen combined with MPA, or medroxyprogesterone acetate (this type is
often called combination therapy). 
Remember, estrogen — at least in its homegrown state in your own body — is
good for the heart and blood vessels. The WHI folks were surprised, then,
when they found no protective function for cardiovascular health in either
the unopposed estrogen or the estrogen plus progestin group. In fact, in
some cases, particularly among study participants taking estrogen and prog-
estin, the hormone therapy was actually having some detrimental effects. In
this section, we tackle the differences that the WHI study uncovered.
Using estrogen plus progestin
Compared with those taking a placebo, the group taking the estrogen and
progestin therapy experienced more
 Breast cancer 
 Heart attacks and an overall increase in coronary heart disease

Part III: Treating the Effects 
Living in “The Big Study” era
You know how there was a Big Band era, right?
Well, you’re fortunate enough to live in the “Big
Health Study” era . . . at least when it comes to
studies on hormones and menopause. In addi-
tion to the WHI, these long-term studies are
making hormone headlines: 
 The Framingham Heart Study (FHS) is the
longest-running study of health in America,
with data on three generations in one
Massachusetts town. 
 The Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replace-
ment Study (HERS) collects data on the
effects of hormone therapy on 2,763 women
with a history of heart disease.
 The Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) has stud-
ied menopause and other health issues
since 1976. 
 KEEPS (Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention
Study) is the new kid on the block, still in the
early stages of a study of hormones and the
heart in women 40 to 50. 
In most cases, other heart researchers reported
similar findings to those of the WHI. In the HERS,
women who were taking unopposed estrogen
did not experience any protection from heart
disease or deaths from heart disease, and expe-
rienced a greater incidence of blood clots. In
the first year of this study there was an
increased incidence of heart disease (but again,
the HERS participants had a prior history of
heart disease). In the Framingham study, after
24 years of follow-up, women who had been
taking unopposed estrogen reported twice the
levels of coronary heart disease that they had
experienced prior to menopause. 

 Stroke
 Blood clots (deep vein thrombosis — clots in the lower body and legs —
and pulmonary embolism — clots that broke off and traveled to the
lungs) 
There was no protective effect against either heart disease or peripheral
artery disease.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has placed a warning on estrogen
products, advising against their use to prevent coronary heart disease.
Taking unopposed estrogen
In the estrogen group, and, again, compared with the women who took place-
bos, the group taking the actual estrogen therapy experienced
 More strokes 
 A slight trend toward a greater risk for blood clots 
The only good news: Marginally fewer women (those at the younger end of
the 50- to 79-year-old group studied) from the unopposed estrogen group
required procedures to open clogged arteries. 
Identifying the Heart Disease Culprit
Does your risk of heart disease increase over time because of menopause, or
just because you’re older? Is the culprit age, or is it menopause itself?
Doctors say that our “absolute risk” of many diseases more or less doubles
with each passing decade (encouraging, huh?). Your risk for a given disease in
your 60s, then, is about twice what it was when you were in your 50s. And yet,
most of us know vital, healthy women who make it to their 70s, 80s, even 90s
and beyond without getting cancer, or heart disease, or lung disease, or any of
the other serious conditions we often associate with aging. This is why studies
such as these large ones, that follow individuals for years or even decades, are
an important means of figuring out what factors differ between the people
who get sick and the people who stay remarkably healthy for their ages.
Considering the age of menopause
The age at which you reach menopause seems to be one of the heart disease
risk factors worth looking at. The Nurses’ Health Study found that 
165
Chapter 12: Understanding Hormone Therapy and Your Heart

 The risk of heart attack for women who experienced early menopause
after their ovaries were surgically removed increases with younger age
at menopause.
 Entering menopause in your early 40s instead of your 50s increases the
risk of heart disease, hardening of the arteries, and death from certain
types of heart disease.
The WHI studied women of normal menopause age and older (50 to 79), but
the Framingham and Nurse’s Health Studies include younger women as well.
Younger women are the primary focus of the KEEPS initiative. Studies such as
these will help us learn more about the relative effects of age and of
menopause.
Factoring in other factors
Of course, things are never simple in research. Simply looking at age at
menopause and heart disease will probably not tell us much. Good research
teases out the likely effects of age plus other risk factors, including
 Genetics
 Lifestyle
 Health history and health habits
All of these factors interact so that every woman’s situation — and thus her
risk of heart disease — is unique. The Nurses’ Health Study, for example,
shows that if you entered menopause early, after ovary removal, and you’re a
smoker, you are at increased risk for coronary heart disease.
Given the lack of a definitive answer about which of several answers puts a
middle-aged woman at risk for heart disease, we can only suggest that you
take care of the variables you can control:
 Eat a diet low on the food chain, high in fruits and vegetables, and low 
in animal products (see Chapter 18, “Eating for the Change,” for more
suggestions.
 Don’t smoke!
 Use alcohol in moderation or not at all.
 See your doctor regularly and follow her advice about keeping your cho-
lesterol and blood pressure at a healthy level.
 Exercise regularly.
166
Part III: Treating the Effects 

Skimming the Fat: Hormone 
Therapy and Your Blood
In general, what’s good for your blood is good for your heart. Age and bad
habits can contribute to the accumulation of fats and calcifications in your
arteries, clogging them up just like old plumbing, and raising your risk of a
whole host of dangerous events and conditions, including hypertension,
heart attack, stroke, and angina. In this section we’ll talk about some of these
risks, and the role that hormones and hormone therapy play in their develop-
ment and their management. 
Combating hypertension
Hypertension (high blood pressure) is often caused by hardening of the arter-
ies or coronary artery disease. Over the years, lipids and cholesterol can get
deposited on the walls of your blood vessels. This process, called atheroscle-
rosis, causes your arteries to thicken and impedes the flow of blood through
your veins. This can raise your blood pressure, forcing your heart to pump
harder. Hypertension can lead to stroke, heart attack, heart failure, and other
serious health problems such as kidney disease and vision problems.
Recognizing the signs
One of the scariest things about hypertension is that about 30 percent of
people who have it never have any symptoms at all — only a blood pressure
check will reveal the condition. Some women, though, have warning signs like
these:
 Vision problems
 Severe headaches
 Blurred vision
 Shortness of breath
Smoking, being older than 35 (need we add that most menopausal women
are?), overweight, African American, or eating fatty foods or too much salt
also put you at greater risk of hypertension; so does a family history of the
condition.
Once upon a time it was thought that higher blood pressure was a normal
part of aging, the body’s way of helping blood through stiffening veins and
arteries. Now we know, of course, that high blood pressure (hypertension) is
a danger sign at any age, and is associated with heart, kidney, and eye dis-
eases, as well as an increased risk of stroke.
167
Chapter 12: Understanding Hormone Therapy and Your Heart

Determining the role of hormones
By helping maintain healthy triglyceride and cholesterol levels in your blood,
estrogen lowers your risk of developing atherosclerosis, which is a major
cause of angina, heart attacks, and other problems. Estrogen can help pre-
vent atherosclerosis in two ways:
 It decreases LDL levels: Estrogen helps get rid of some of the “bad” cho-
lesterol in your blood by increasing the amount of LDL your liver breaks
down, so that more LDL gets purged from your arteries. Estrogen pills
are more effective than patches at this job, but both work over time.
 It increases HDL levels: HDL cholesterol is the type of cholesterol that
can carry excess fat out of your bloodstream and back to your liver for
reprocessing.
In spite of the role estrogen plays in regulating cholesterol, neither unop-
posed estrogen therapy nor combination (estrogen plus progestin) therapies
have been found to protect women against heart disease, peripheral artery
disease, or coronary death. The WHI found that among the younger women
in their 50- to 79-year-old study group, there was a slight hint of lowered risk
of cardiovascular disease among those using unopposed estrogen. Even so,
the FDA warns against the use of any type of HT to prevent heart coronary
heart disease. If you feel you need HT for the relief of menopausal symptoms,
take the smallest effective dose for the shortest possible amount of time
needed to treat your symptoms. 
You can only use unopposed estrogen if your uterus has been removed.
Cleaning out clots and clogs
A chunk of the plaque (the goop formed by fat, and other substances) can
break off and clog an artery, causing a heart attack or stroke. A stroke can
also be caused by blood clots forming unexpectedly because of the presence
of a greater-than-necessary level of clotting chemicals in your blood. These
clots can get stuck in a blood vessel that feeds your brain (stroke), in a deep
vessel the feeds your heart (deep vein thrombosis) or lung (pulmonary
embolism), or in your heart itself (heart attack). All in all, the blood, blood
vessels, and heart comprise your cardiovascular system, and a problem in one
area means trouble for another. To avoid blood problems that can lead to
heart disease, keep your total cholesterol, LDL (“bad” cholesterol), and
triglyceride levels low and keep your HDL (“good” cholesterol) levels high.
Recognizing the signs
As with hypertension, blood clots can sneak up on you without giving you
any obvious symptoms. Pulmonary embolism can cause shortness of breath,
or it may not. Early signs of a stroke may include some or all of these:
168
Part III: Treating the Effects 

 Numbness or weakness on one side of your body
 Sudden blurring or dimming of vision
 Difficulty speaking
 Sudden dizziness or severe headaches with nausea and vomiting
 Sudden confusion or loss of consciousness
Rapid treatment is critical in stroke treatment. If you even suspect that you or
someone with you is having a stroke, call for emergency care immediately!
Determining the role of hormones
WHI findings indicate a strong association between unopposed estrogen ther-
apy and stroke. The increased risk was so great that the researchers halted
the treatment portion of the study on unopposed estrogen and heart health
in 2002. Again, keeping your triglyceride and cholesterol levels normal is the
most important way to lower your risk of blood clots and the damage they
can do. Your body’s own home-grown estrogen does this naturally, but estro-
gen — with or without progestin — HT has been associated with an increased
risk of stroke and blood clots. Keep your doctor aware of any history of
blood clots or stroke in your family. If you are at risk, your doctor may decide
you are not a good candidate for hormone therapy.
Another large study, the Nurses’ Healthy Study, also found that hormone
therapy (estrogen and progesterone) increased the risk of stroke in the first
two years of use. After two years, the risk seemed to drop back down to a
risk level corresponding to the risk women not using hormone therapy face.
In women, maintaining this balance is even more important than your total
cholesterol number.
169
Chapter 12: Understanding Hormone Therapy and Your Heart
Deciphering the diet data
Findings from the WHI Dietary Modification
study confused a lot of folks, because, women
who followed a low-fat diet did not have signif-
icantly less heart disease than those following
their normal diet. Does this give you the green
light to replace fruits with French fries? Um . . .
no. First, women on the low-fat diet did exhibit
small improvements in LDL (“bad” cholesterol)
levels, blood pressure, body weight, and levels
of a blood clotting factor called Factor VII C.
Second, the study looked only at total fat intake,
so good fats such as those containing omega-3
acids (in Chapter 18 we fill you in on these) were
lumped in with saturated and trans fats. Third,
many of the women in the low-fat group hadn’t
stuck closely to the study’s low-fat guidelines.
Women who did so had better individual out-
comes. Bottom line? Restricting your consump-
tion of saturated fats and trans fats plays an
important role in keeping you healthy.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has placed warnings on estrogen
products against their use to prevent coronary heart disease.
Oiling the Pump: HT and Your Heart
The changes that menopause brings have a large impact on your heart, so it
makes sense that hormone therapy has a large effect also.
Slowing the pace
A fluttering heart doesn’t always signal new love. Many women experience
heart palpitations (a pounding, racing heart) for the first time during the
change. 
Palpitations can indicate a variety of cardiovascular problems and should 
be taken seriously. Check these symptoms out with your primary care 
physician.
The effects of hormone therapy on heart palpitations aren’t really on the
radar screen of scientists investigating the benefits and harms of hormone
therapy. When your estrogen levels drop, as they do during the change, your
brain sends out adrenaline in an attempt to spur on estrogen production.
Your heart responds to this adrenaline surge by pounding. 
Keeping angina away
Angina can feel like you have a weight on your chest. Although some women
feel angina even when they do nothing, most women feel the pressure only
when they exercise. You feel pressure because your heart isn’t getting
enough blood. When you exercise, spasms cause your coronary arteries to
tighten, which restricts the flow of blood to your heart. In response, your
heart screams to get your attention, and you feel chest pain.
Estrogen, prior to menopause, has a soothing effect on blood vessels and
reduces spasms. The WHI, however, found an increased risk of heart attack
among participants in the estrogen plus progestin study.
Ironically, there was some hint in the findings of the WHI study of women
taking unopposed estrogen, that women at the younger end of their group of
50- to 79-year-old participants may actually have experienced a slight
decrease in cardiovascular risk. 
170
Part III: Treating the Effects 

Avoiding the big one
The medical name for a heart attack is myocardial infarction (sometimes
abbreviated as MI). A heart attack is caused by a blockage (usually from a
blood clot or a plaque deposit) in one or more of your coronary arteries.
Blockages can restrict blood flow to your heart and cause either a heart
attack or the death of heart tissue (heart disease).
A woman having a heart attack may experience the symptoms men do —
pain in the chest, jaw, and right arm, sweating, and shortness of breath. But
you may also have nausea, abdominal and/or back pain, nausea, vomiting,
and extreme fatigue. It still takes longer for a woman’s heart attack to be diag-
nosed in the emergency room than it does for a man’s, so don’t delay. Seek
emergency help immediately if you even think it’s a heart attack.
Women’s Health Initiative findings
The WHI study found that heart attacks actually increased 24 percent for
women using conjugated estrogen and MPA progestin, and an 81 percent rise
in the risk of coronary heart disease. But, although the risk of having a heart
attack increased, the incidence of dying from one didn’t. Based on this infor-
mation, some doctors are removing patients from hormone therapy. Others
are taking more of a wait-and-watch attitude, especially given that these
results are out of whack with a number of other studies.
Unopposed estrogen
Estrogen improves blood flow in your coronary arteries by dilating the blood
vessels, helping your body continue to eliminate plaque inside the vessels,
and maintaining healthy clotting. Estrogen therapy, however, provides no
protection from heart disease for women older than 60. Among younger
study participants there was a hint of lowered cardiovascular risk and a pos-
sibility of lowered rates of procedures to open arteries.
Estrogen plus progestin
The WHI study found an increased risk of heart attacks in this group, and no
suggestion of protection against cardiovascular disease or peripheral artery
disease.

Checking Out Hormone Therapy
and Breast Cancer
In This Chapter
 Recognizing your breast-cancer risks
 Debating the benefits of HT and the risk of breast cancer
 Choosing an HT regimen with breast cancer in mind
I
s hormone therapy (HT) risky business in terms of increasing your risk 
of developing breast cancer? Reports place hormones at the scene of the
crime time and again, and it is clear now that long-term exposure to estrogen
plus progestin therapy is strongly associated with breast cancer. Questions
remain, though, about who is at greatest risk, and what guidelines exist to
help you make informed decisions about hormone use. In this chapter, you
can find out what researchers know for sure and what they’re still studying
about HT and the risk of breast cancer.
Beginning with Breast Basics
Breast tissue and fat are the two main components of the breast. You no
doubt already know about fat, so that subject needs no further explanation.
But breast tissue is slightly more complex.
Breast tissue is composed of sections called lobes. Lobes are made up of lob-
ules, which produce milk when you breastfeed. Ducts carry milk from the lob-
ules to the nipple. Cancers tend to form either in the lobules or in the ducts.
Figure 13-1 illustrates the parts of a breast.

Defining Breast Cancer
Whether breast cancer forms in the lobules or the ducts, it begins when cells
divide and grow at an abnormally fast rate. The cells morph into odd shapes
and start clumping together to form cancerous (malignant) tumors.
What triggers this process? Researchers know that it takes a mutation (a freak
act of nature that affects the basic building blocks of cells) to get things
going, but no one knows how the initial cells become mutated. Most
researchers feel that a carcinogen (a cancer-causing agent) in the environ-
ment serves as the trigger. There are two main types of breast cancer and
one condition that can lead to cancer:
 Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS): Technically, this is cancer, because the
cells are abnormal and grow very quickly. It’s called in situ (which means
in place) because the cancer cells haven’t spread beyond a very
restricted area (usually a breast duct or lobule). Carcinoma in situ is
sometimes called Stage 0 cancer. Although your doctor will likely recom-
mend removing such a cancer, your treatment will probably not be as
aggressive as it would for an invasive cancer.

Part III: Treating the Effects 

 Lobular cancer in situ (LCIS): Though contained for now in the lobules,
this is not considered a true cancer. Your doctor may advise a “watch
and wait” approach or a hormone treatment (more on these in the sec-
tion on “Using Hormones as Therapy” later in this chapter).
 Invasive ductile cancer: This type of cancer starts in the ducts and
spreads to surrounding tissues.
 Invasive lobular cancer: This type of cancer starts in the lobules and
spreads to surrounding tissues.
Both invasive ductile and invasive lobular cancers can move through the
breast tissue into your blood vessels, thereby gaining access to your entire
body. When this happens, the cancer is said to have metastasized, or spread.
Early detection means you can treat cancer before it spreads. 
Taking Care of Your Breasts
You probably already know about the importance of performing a monthly
breast self-exam and getting a regular mammogram. The following sections
tell you why these two simple tests are so vital to your breast health.
Examining your breasts every month
The American Cancer Society recommends that you examine your breasts for
lumps and bumps every month after you reach the age of 20. And your
doctor should do a breast exam as part of your yearly gynecological visit.
The American Cancer Society even offers self-exam guide cards you can hang
in your shower that show you how to perform a breast exam and what you
should look and feel for. Ask your gynecologist for a card, give the American
Cancer Society a call (phone: 800-ACS-2345) and ask a representative to send
you one, or request one at www.cancer.org.
The most common symptom of breast cancer noticeable during a self-exam is
a hard, immovable lump in your breast, which may or may not be painful.
Sometimes the skin that stretches over the lump looks thick or indented;
sometimes it looks dimpled like an orange peel. You may also notice that
your nipple leaks a dark fluid or turns inward. If you notice any of these signs,
contact your doctor.
175
Chapter 13: Checking Out Hormone Therapy and Breast Cancer

Sometimes a lump you feel in your breast isn’t cancerous. Breast lumps can
occur as the result of several breast conditions. (For more information on
breast conditions, take a look at Breast Cancer for Dummies, Ronit Elk and
Monica Morrow published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.)
Making time for mammograms
Although you may see articles every year or so questioning the necessity of
mammograms, most medical folks say, “Just do it.” Mammograms are rela-
tively painless, cost effective, and fast.
Have your first mammogram around age 35 so your doctor has something
with which to compare future mammograms. If you’re between 40 and 49, you
should have a mammogram every year or two. If you’re over 50, do it every
year. At your annual checkup, make sure your medical practitioner gives you a
clinical breast exam, too (essentially a more expert version of your self-exam).
Here’s a fact: The best chance of surviving breast cancer comes from early
detection. Individuals who downplay the importance of annual screenings
question whether mammogram screenings actually decrease the death rate.
The more useful measure of the effectiveness of mammograms is whether
regular mammograms increase the detection rate of new breast cancers —
and they do! 
If you’re a woman in your 40s, having mammograms on a regular basis can
reduce your chance of dying from breast cancer by about 17 percent. For
women between the ages of 50 and 69, regular mammograms can reduce
deaths by about 30 percent. Early detection can reduce the numbers of
women who have to undergo drawn-out and painful treatments for breast
cancer. With today’s mammogram technology, healthcare providers can iden-
tify cancer at an early stage, before it invades the bloodstream and gains
access to other parts of your body. Early detection allows doctors to treat
breast cancer with a shorter and less invasive course of treatment.
Medicare pays for a yearly mammogram for all women over 40, plus a base-
line mammogram for women between 35 and 39. 
Determining Estrogen’s Role
Although a great deal of controversy surrounds the why’s and how’s, nearly
everyone agrees that estrogen plays some role in the development of breast
cancer. Even the natural estrogen in your body during your reproductive
years increases your risk of breast cancer because it stimulates cell repro-
duction in your breasts. When it comes to estrogen and menopause, here are
the things most experts agree on:
176
Part III: Treating the Effects 

 Estrogen is a key promoter of breast-cancer development. So controlling
estrogen levels in breast tissue should lower your risk of breast cancer.
 The earlier you begin perimenopause and the shorter your reproductive
cycle is, the lower your risk of breast cancer because these factors
decrease you total lifetime exposure to high levels of estrogen.
 Being overweight (gaining 45 pounds or more after your 18th birthday
or being 20 percent over your target weight) after the onset of
menopause increases estrogen levels in your body and can increase the
risk of breast cancer. (Check out Chapter 18 for more information on
determining your ideal weight.)
This risk doesn’t apply to perimenopausal women who are overweight
(though extra weight does put you at risk for other health problems).
Checking the Link between 
HT and Breast Cancer
Findings from several parts of the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) study
address the relationship between hormone therapy and breast cancer. The
major findings were:
 Women taking estrogen plus progestin began to show an elevated inci-
dence of breast cancer after four years of use, so much so that the treat-
ment portion of the study was actually stopped early.
 Women taking estrogen plus progestin also tended to have larger, faster-
growing tumors than did the women taking placebos in this study.
 Out of every 10,000 women, 38 taking estrogen plus progestin were diag-
nosed with breast cancer, as opposed to 30 women out of every 10,000
who were taking placebos.
 Women taking estrogen alone did not have an elevated risk of breast
cancer after seven years of hormone use. In fact, this therapy actually
seemed to have some protective effect against breast cancer. In the
group of roughly 5,000 women taking estrogen, 129 got breast cancer. In
the same sized group of women taking placebos, 161 got cancer.
Outcomes from other large studies of hormone use have their own findings,
only some of which are consistent with what the WHI found:
 In the HERS study of 2,763 women with a history of heart disease,
women taking estrogen plus progestin were at increased risk for breast
cancer.
177
Chapter 13: Checking Out Hormone Therapy and Breast Cancer

 In the Nurse’s Health Study (of over 120,000 participants), the duration
of hormone use was significant. Breast cancer incidence was higher in
women taking estrogen plus progestin (compared with those taking
placebos), but only after 20 or more years of hormone use.
 Women in the Nurse’s study taking estrogen alone had an increased risk
for breast cancer after only five years of use. 
All of these studies found that taking estrogen plus progestin was associated
with an increase in breast cancer. In some cases, this increased risk was only
apparent after a number of years of hormone use, but in the WHI study risk
was apparent after only four years and increased with each additional year of
hormone use.
These results of the WHI estrogen-alone study sound like good news for
women who have had a hysterectomy (remember, only women without a
uterus can take estrogen alone), but were somewhat surprising to
researchers. Estrogen has for so long been associated with an increased risk
of breast cancer, and other studies seem to support an estrogen-breast
cancer link. The Nurse’s study found that women taking estrogen only had an
elevated risk of breast cancer. Doctors are continuing to follow up on the
women in the estrogen-only study, to find out whether lifetime risk of breast
cancer is consistent with this initial WHI finding.
The risk of breast cancer for any given woman is still small, and we still don’t
know what the effects of hormones on younger women will be (the WHI study
also focused on the use of hormones by women between 50 and 79), so we
don’t know what outcomes for younger women would be. Other studies, such
as the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study (KEEPS), is still (as of this
writing) collecting data on the effects of hormone use in younger women and
in those receiving their estrogen from a patch instead of by mouth; which
may have a lowered risk of side effects. In the meantime, the WHI findings are
significant and will likely help to shape the way most doctors approach rec-
ommending estrogen to their patients.
Assessing Your Risks
The two biggest risks for breast cancer are being female and being over 40.
Both risks are realistically unavoidable, and they both present you with a
whole bunch of positives. So who would want to avoid them?
178
Part III: Treating the Effects 

Recognizing risks you can’t control
As frustrating as it is, some breast-cancer risk factors are out of your control.
Even your own estrogen appears to heighten your breast-cancer risks (see
the “Determining Estrogen’s Role” section earlier in this chapter). This sec-
tion lists the risks you can’t do anything about, but you can control other fac-
tors (which we cover in the “Recognizing risks you can control” section later
in this chapter):
 Age: Of course it’s not fair, but the older you get, the greater your risk of
breast cancer. That’s an important fact to keep in mind. When you’re
younger than 40, your risk is quite low. But, after 40, your breast cancer
risk increases until you’re about 80. The good news is that when you hit
80, your risk of breast cancer actually decreases a bit. 
 Breast density: Breasts with more breast tissue than fat tissue are com-
paratively denser, and detecting small tumors in dense breast tissue is
more difficult than detecting them in fatty tissue. At least one study has
found a correlation between greater breast density and an increased risk
of breast cancer. 
 Ethnicity: In North America, Caucasian women have the highest risk of
breast cancer. Ashkenazi Jews are at greater risk of breast cancer than
women from other cultures too (it appears that they have a higher rate
of the genetic mutation known as BRCA1, which we’ll discuss momentar-
ily). Hawaiian and African-American women have the next highest risk of
breast cancer, while Latinas, Asian Americans, and Native Americans
have the lowest rates of breast cancer in the United States.
 Genetics: If someone in your immediate family has breast cancer, your
risk of breast cancer almost doubles. If both mom and sis have breast
cancer, your risk is about 21⁄2 times greater than the risk of a woman
without breast cancer in her family.
If you’re worried about your family history of breast cancer, you may
want to take genetic tests that look for two genetic mutations — BRCA1
and BRCA2 — that leave you more susceptible to breast cancer.
However, only about 10 percent of breast cancers come from inherited
genetic mutations.
The letters BRCA stand for breast cancer. BRCA1 is a genetic mutation
found in people with a family history of ovarian and breast cancer.
BRCA2 is a genetic mutation found in people with a family history of
male and female breast cancer. Your lifetime risk of getting breast cancer
if you carry one of these genetic mutations is between 50 percent and 85
percent. The presence of one of these (especially BRCA1) also increases
your risk of developing ovarian cancer. 
179
Chapter 13: Checking Out Hormone Therapy and Breast Cancer

 Location of fat on your body: If you wear your fat high in your body
(around your midsection), your risk of breast cancer is about six times
as high as that of a woman who wears her fat around her hips, thighs,
and buttocks.
 Menstrual history: The later you begin menstruating and the earlier you
begin menopause, the lower your risk of breast cancer, presumably
because you generate less estrogen over your lifetime.
 “Precancerous” breast tumors: Receiving a diagnosis of abnormal cell
growth, carcinoma in situ, for example, increases your risk of breast
cancer. (Check out the “Defining Breast Cancer” section earlier in this
chapter for more on carcinoma in situ.)
Fibrocystic condition of the breast, a condition in which you develop little
lumps in your breast tissue (usually seven to ten days before your
period), does not increase your risk of breast cancer.
Recognizing risks you can control
The very thought of breast cancer may make you feel panicked and helpless,
but there are risk factors you can control. If a look at the list below shows
that you’re already following a “breast healthy” lifestyle, give yourself a pat
on the back: 
 Alcohol consumption: Having more than three drinks a week raises your
risk of breast cancer. This fact holds true whether you’re taking hor-
mone therapy (HT) or not, but it’s especially true if you take the conju-
gated equine form of estrogen. Alcohol raises the level of estrogen (the
estrone type) in your body. 
 Antioxidants: Vitamins A, C, E, beta-carotene, selenium, and glutathione
are antioxidants that protect the body from premature aging and cancer
(see Chapter 18 for more on antioxidants). When taken by menopausal
women, these antioxidants lower the risk of breast cancer.
 Dietary fat: Dietary studies yield mixed results, but most indicate (or at
least strongly suggest) that a diet high in fat, especially saturated and
animal-derived fats, increases your risk. Animal fats also introduce pesti-
cides and antibiotics into your diet. 
 Exercise: Multiple studies associate regular exercise with a lowered risk
of getting an initial cancer or a recurrence.
 Pregnancy: Women who have at least one pregnancy have a lower risk
of breast cancer during their lifetime than women who have never been
pregnant. But you have to read the fine print that accompanies this risk
factor because you actually have a slightly higher risk of breast cancer
during the ten years immediately following the birth. After ten years or
180
Part III: Treating the Effects 

so, your risk of breast cancer drops so that women with one child have a
lower risk of breast cancer than women who have never borne a child. In
general, the more babies you have, the lower your lifetime risk of breast
cancer.
 Weight gain/obesity: Gaining more than 45 pounds at any point
increases your risk of breast cancer. Breast cancer is linked to higher
levels of estrogen (especially the estrone type of estrogen found in fat).
(Check out Chapter 18 for additional information on weight-related
issues.)
Using Hormones as Therapy
A special class of artificially created hormones has the potential to treat or
help to prevent certain breast cancers in some women. Many cancer cells are
classified as hormone receptor positive — that is, they seek out and link up
with hormones that promote their growth. Estrogen or progestins connect
with these cancer cells much as two puzzle pieces fit together; this linkage
promotes or accelerates the cancer’s activity. Hormone therapy (sometimes
called anti-estrogens or anti-progestins) work in different ways to prevent
your body’s hormones from making this cancer connection.
181
Chapter 13: Checking Out Hormone Therapy and Breast Cancer
Knowing for sure: Tests for breast cancer
If you find a lump in your breast, there are sev-
eral ways to examine it to see if the lump is
something to be concerned about. The type of
test your doctor uses depends on the size of the
lump and its location:
 Fine needle aspiration: Right in the office,
the doctor sticks a tiny needle into the lump,
drains some fluid, and sends the fluid off to
the lab to check for cancerous cells.
 Needle core biopsy: The doctor performs
this test in the hospital as an outpatient pro-
cedure, and uses a local anesthetic. The
doctor sticks a needle into the suspected
problem area, removes some breast tissue,
and sends it to the lab to be checked.
 Open biopsy: This surgical procedure is
performed in the hospital using anesthesia.
The doctor makes a small incision and
removes part or all of the lump, which he
then sends to the lab for analysis.
 Noninvasive procedures:
Non-surgical
technologies such as PET scans, MRI, and
ultrasounds are sometimes used for
screening following an abnormal mammo-
gram, but studies show that they miss too
many cancers to be a standard replace-
ment for biopsy.

Counting the ways
If tests reveal that your cancer is hormone receptor positive, there are basi-
cally four classes of hormone treatment that your doctor might recommend:
 SERMs (selective estrogen receptor modulators). These man-made hor-
mones work by blocking the cancer cell’s hormone receptors. It’s a little
like using an outlet plug to keep your child from sticking her finger in the
socket and getting hurt. Two SERMs have been prominent in the cancer
news of late: Tamoxifen (designed to fight breast cancer) and Raloxifene
(an osteoporosis medication that turned out to have cancer-fighting
potential).The STAR study found them to be equally effective at fighting
cancer, but Raloxifene has fewer side effects (see Chapter 11 for more
information about SERMs).
 ERDs (estrogen receptor down-regulators). ERDs are a lot like SERMs,
except that instead of merely blocking cancer cells’ receptors to keep
them from getting a green light from hormones, they actually destroy the
cancer cells’ estrogen receptors so they can’t communicate with your
hormones at all.
 Aromatase inhibitors. No, these don’t have anything to do with keeping
you from smelling the cookies baking. Remember that after your ovaries
throw in the towel, your body’s fat cells continue to make a certain
amount of estrogen that can feed growing cancers. Aromatase inhibitors
keep a lid on how much estrogen your body can make after menopause.
There’s one more way doctors can manipulate your hormones to help pre-
vent cancer or the recurrence of cancer, or to try to inhibit a cancer that’s
already there. Remember when we talked about how premature menopause
can result from surgical removal of your ovaries, from the use of certain med-
ications, or from exposure to radiation treatments? Doing any of these things
on purpose can have the same effect: shutting down the working of your
ovaries. This results in less estrogen being available to promote cancer
growth. The down side, of course, is that doing these will put you into
menopause. 
Most of these hormone therapies are administered by mouth, as a daily pill.
Remembering to take your pill and adhering to the routine your doctor rec-
ommends is very important.
Reviewing the risks and benefits
The benefits of using these kinds of hormone therapies are obvious. They can
help to prevent an initial breast cancer in women at greatest risk, work
toward preventing a recurrence in those who have had breast cancer already,
help to shrink tumors before or after more traditional treatment, or augment
182
Part III: Treating the Effects 

each other, because one type of hormone therapy is sometimes prescribed
when another has done the best work it can and still needs some help.
Hormone therapy doesn’t typically take the place of traditional therapies
such as surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy, but it can support and enhance
these, or, when before them, give them a head start by shrinking the size of a
tumor.
Hormone therapies of this kind, alas, are not without unpleasant side effects.
You may experience hot flashes, moodiness, vaginal dryness, and weight
gain. Some therapies increase your risk of uterine cancer (the breast cancer-
fighting element outweighs the small less-than-one percent increase in risk,
though), weaken your bones, increase the risk of blood clots, and cause
upset stomach.
Choosing Your HT Regimen 
If you’re a woman concerned about breast cancer (and aren’t we all?), you
will find conflicting information and advice at every turn about the use of
hormone therapies. When the first edition of this book was released, the type
of HT believed to have the greatest correlation with breast cancer risk was
estrogen-alone. New information from the WHI seems to implicate estrogen
plus progestin, while the estrogen alone trial actually found a hint that estro-
gen use might have a small protective effect when it comes to breast cancer.
Findings like these don’t make decision-making that much simpler.
Take a close look at yourself when you answer the question, “Is HT right for
me?” The role of HT in breast cancer is still unanswered. Despite lots of
research, all we can say is, “We don’t know.” You need to review all the avail-
able information on breast cancer and HT and then consider your own med-
ical issues and family history.

H
ormone therapy (HT) has been linked to all kinds of reproductive can-
cers. In some cases, HT is thought to lower the risk of cancer. In other
cases, it may increase the risk of cancer. And, in others, it’s thought to have
absolutely no effect.
In this chapter, we look at cervical, colon (or more accurately colorectal),
endometrial (uterine), vaginal, vulval, and ovarian cancers. In each case, we
introduce you to the particular cancer and its symptoms, review the screen-
ing procedures and tests, discuss the role (or lack thereof) HT plays in con-
nection with each cancer, and perform a quick risk-benefit analysis.
What about breast cancer? Well, because of all the issues that surround that
topic, — it gets its very own chapter — Chapter 13.
Colorectal Cancer
The colon and the rectum are the last stops on the digestive tract before
waste moves out of the body. The first six feet or so of the large intestines is
called the colon; the last six inches is called the rectum. If you’re wondering
how your body holds six feet of tubing, take a look at Figure 14-1, which
shows the location of the colon and rectum.

Though commonly known as colon cancer, the proper name for this type of
cancer is colorectal cancer because it can occur in either the colon or the
rectum. And yeah, we know these aren’t really reproductive organs, but
they’re in the same neighborhood, and are often checked as part of your reg-
ular gynecological exam, so they’re along for the ride in this chapter.
Colorectal cancer is a slow-growing cancer that begins as a polyp (a small
growth) on the mucous lining (mucosa) of the colon, as shown in Figure 14-2.
Polyps can show up in the colon and be perfectly harmless (asking why is
like asking cats why they pounce; they just do). But some polyps have the
potential to become cancerous.
One of the most common cancers, colorectal cancer is the third leading
cause of cancer death in American women (behind lung and breast cancer).
Over 90 percent of cases are found in people over 50 years of age. Colorectal
cancer is easily detectable, and you can easily prevent it by making a few
healthy lifestyle choices and having regular checkups.

Recognizing the signs
Rectal bleeding and bloody stools are the most common symptoms of col-
orectal cancer. Additional symptoms include diarrhea, constipation, skinny
stools, frequent gas pains, and feeling as though you can’t completely pass
the stool. Some people with this disease lose weight, feel fatigued, or become
anemic (a condition in which you don’t have enough red blood cells to carry
oxygen around your body).
Finding out for sure: Screenings and tests
A number of screening procedures reduce your risk of colon cancer. Having
an annual screening, in fact, is the number-one way to reduce your risk of col-
orectal cancer if you’re a woman over age 50. When your doctor checks you
out for colorectal cancer, she can look for cancer and polyps on the lining of
your colon that may become cancerous. Removing any polyps removes some
of your cancer risk as well.

Chapter 14: Reviewing Reproductive Cancers and Hormone Therapy

Here’s why catching polyps early is so important: When colorectal cancer is
found before it spreads to other areas of the body, the survival rate is 96 per-
cent. When colorectal cancer spreads, long-term survival rates drop dramati-
cally. So getting annual screenings after you turn 50 is well worth the effort.
Generally doctors start out with minimally invasive screening procedures,
such as the digital exam and fecal occult test, and move to more invasive pro-
cedures only when initial results warrant additional tests. The following tests
are generally your first line of defense:
 Digital rectal exam: Your doctor inserts a gloved finger into your
rectum to check for lumps, bumps, or other changes in the rectum. Not
the most pleasant part of your annual checkup, but important all the
same.
 Fecal occult blood test: This test is a bit messy, but it really must be
done. Some of the newer tests look like some home pregnancy tests — a
piece of paper turns a different color if the sample has blood in it. Your
doctor takes a sample during your exam and places it on a test card. You
know the results immediately. There’s a home version, too, that you use
in the privacy of your own bathroom and return to the doctor.
If blood is found in your stool or the doctor feels something suspicious
during the digital exam, the doctor may perform one of these procedures to
further check things out:
 Colonoscopy: While you’re under mild sedation, your doctor inserts a
scope into your colon, which allows her to carefully examine the walls of
your colon and rectum (yes, all six feet or so). She can even take pic-
tures of your colon walls, and any polyps can be removed on the spot
and examined by a lab for evidence of cancer.
 Sigmoidoscopy: Doctors normally sedate patients before performing
this test. Your doctor inserts a thin scope about 10 to 12 inches into
your rectum through which he can see any polyps or damaged areas in
your colon and take a sample if necessary.
 Barium enema: You may hear folks refer to this test as a lower GI series.
It’s not used very often; colonoscopies and sigmoidoscopies are more
common. This procedure involves a barium enema and a technician taking
a series of x-rays of your colon and rectum. The barium highlights your
colon — particularly any polyps or growths. If you have growths, your
doctor will probably follow up with a colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy.
A colonoscopy is now recommended as a routine screening procedure for
people 50 and over.
188
Part III: Treating the Effects 

Determining the role of hormone therapy
For reasons unknown (though most researchers suspect estrogen plays the
role of the heroine here), hormone therapy actually lowers your risk of colon
cancer. In fact, you reduce your risk of colon cancer by more than one-third
while you take hormone therapy. The Women’s Health Initiative findings on
hormone therapy and colorectal cancers were a bit complicated, though.
Women taking estrogen plus progesterone therapy had fewer colorectal can-
cers, but they were more advanced cancers than the ones found among par-
ticipants taking placebos. 
The risk reduction only exists while you stay on hormone therapy; the pro-
tection diminishes after you stop taking it.
Assessing your risks
Some of the factors that raise your risk of colorectal cancer are
 Age: Over 90 percent of colorectal cancer patients are over the age of 50.
With each decade after 50, your risk doubles.
 Diet: Diets high in fat and low on fiber-rich vegetables are associated
with more colon cancer. Eating red meat frequently (once a day) can
double your risk. Animal fat not only is the saturated, unhealthy variety
of fat, but also is the place in which toxins gather. If the animal you’re
eating was exposed to pesticides or other toxins before it became
dinner, you get those poisons when you chow down. 
 Family history: Genetics play a role in colorectal cancer (and many
other cancers as well). If you have one or more family members with
colon cancer, your risk doubles.
 Lifestyle: If going from the couch to the freezer to grab a bowl of ice
cream is your idea of a brisk walk, you can cut your risk of colorectal
cancer in half by putting down the spoon and exercising. Whether you
bike, jog, or simply walk (not to the fridge), you lower your risk. Turn to
Chapter 19 for the skinny on exercise.
Endometrial (Uterine) Cancer
Cancer of the uterus is usually referred to as endometrial cancer because the
cancer usually starts in the endometrium — the lining of the uterus. Take a
look at Figure 14-3 to see the uterus and nearby organs.
189
Chapter 14: Reviewing Reproductive Cancers and Hormone Therapy

Endometrial cancer is one of the most common reproductive cancers in
North America, but it’s readily detected — 75 percent of cases are caught
before the cancer moves beyond the pelvic region — and treatment is very
effective.
The endometrium is very responsive to changes in hormone levels. Too high
a level of estrogen or continued high levels of estrogen over a sustained
period of time cause cells in the endometrium to continue to multiply. If a
mutant cancer cell or two are among those normal endometrial cells, the
estrogen will stimulate cell growth and allow the cancer cells to multiply
along with the normal cells. The occasional cancer cell is usually not a prob-
lem because it gets flushed away during your period, so it doesn’t have a
chance to proliferate. But, with high levels of estrogen (stimulating cell
growth), these cancer cells can multiply.
If you don’t have a uterus because you’ve had a hysterectomy, you don’t
need to worry about endometrial cancer because you don’t have endometrial
tissue.

Part III: Treating the Effects 

Recognizing the signs
Most cases of endometrial cancer are caught and caught early enough to cure
because the symptoms are so obvious. Any of these symptoms are a signal to
see your doctor:
 Bleeding after menopause
 Irregular vaginal bleeding
 Unusual spotting between periods during perimenopause
Pain and cramping are generally not an early symptom of this type of
endometrial cancer. (But, after endometrial cancer develops, it can invade
the blood vessels and spread to other organs causing this type of pain.)
Sometimes there are no symptoms at all.
Finding out for sure: Tests
A number of tests can identify endometrial cancer:
 Ultrasound: Using sound waves, the doctor is able to create images of
the uterine lining with this test. Ultrasounds are done in the doctor’s
office, and they’re relatively painless. An ultrasound wand is inserted
into the vagina so the technician can get a clear view of the uterus and
lining.
 Saline infusion sohohysterogram or SIS: This specialized form of ultra-
sound is increasingly common these days because it gives us far better
and useful pictures of the endometrium and intrauterine cavity. It is per-
formed in the doctor’s office.
 Endometrial aspiration or biopsy: In this test, the doctor removes a
tissue sample from the lining of the uterus for examination. Endometrial
aspirations can be done in the doctor’s office. Usually there’s no need
for painkilling medication beyond ibuprofen.
 Dilation and curettage (D & C): While you’re under anesthesia, your
doctor will gently scrape tissue from the lining of the uterus for 
examination. 
 Hysteroscopy: This test — now routinely used at the same time that a D
& C is performed — involves the doctor inserting a special microscope
into the uterus to examine the lining (while you’re under anesthesia in
the operating room).
191
Chapter 14: Reviewing Reproductive Cancers and Hormone Therapy

Determining the role of hormone therapy
This one is pretty simple. The higher the dose of estrogen and the longer the
duration of high estrogen levels, the higher the risk of developing cancer in
your uterus.
In the 1970s, after women had been taking estrogen replacement therapy
without a progestin (a term that encompasses both synthetic and natural
forms of progesterone) for years, medical folks noticed that the incidence of
endometrial cancer was three to eight times higher among women taking
estrogen compared to women not taking it.
After studying the problem, doctors realized that without a progestin, the
lining of the uterus continued to thicken unchecked. So now hormone ther-
apy includes a progestin to routinely flush the lining of the uterus through
vaginal bleeding (cyclical hormone therapy) or to keep the lining from grow-
ing (continuous hormone therapy). For more information on the different
types of hormone therapy, turn to Chapter 11.
If you don’t have a uterus because you’ve had a hysterectomy, you don’t
need progesterone in your hormone therapy (as women with a uterus do) to
balance the estrogen to avoid endometrial cancer.
Assessing your risks
Because an imbalance in hormones (particularly estrogen and progesterone)
increases your risk of this type of cancer, things that alter your hormone
levels can raise your risk:
 Age: Over 95 percent of women with endometrial cancer are over 40
years of age. The rate of endometrial cancer rises between the ages of 40
and 70 and then drops around age 80.
 Estrogen: Taking estrogen replacement therapy without progesterone
increases the risk of endometrial cancer, so estrogen alone therapy is
not recommended for women who still have a uterus. 
 More years of menstruation: The earlier you began menstruation and
the later you reach menopause, the more periods you have in a lifetime.
More periods mean more estrogen, and that means greater risk. 
 Obesity: Women who are 20 percent over their ideal weight walk around
with sustained, high levels of estrogen because their body fat produces
it. (For more on weight-related issues, see Chapters 18 and 19.)
If you’re obese, losing weight reduces your risk of endometrial cancer.
192
Part III: Treating the Effects 

Birth control pills actually lower your risk of endometrial cancer. Women who
use the pill for more than two years reduce their risk by about 50 percent,
and women who use the pill for more than five years reduce it by 80 percent.
Ovarian Cancer
The ovaries hold your oocytes (seeds that develop into eggs over the course
of a woman’s reproductive years) and produce sex hormones throughout
your life. Take a look at Figure 14-3 to locate the ovaries. Ovarian cancer origi-
nates from cells in the ovary — both the egg-making cells and the lining of
the ovary.
Cancer of the ovaries (known as ovarian cancer) kills silently, with no early,
predictable warning signs. Few tangible symptoms warn women of this dis-
ease until the tumor has spread beyond the ovary. Ovarian cancer is deadly,
but fortunately, it’s very rare.
Some researchers suggest that ovarian cancer is related to frequency of ovu-
lation during your lifetime. Every time you ovulate, you get a little tear in the
ovary wall. The cells of your ovary repair the tear by dividing rapidly. This
wear and tear in connection with the rapid cell division needed to repair the
damage may be the source of ovarian cancer. Given this explanation, women
who have taken birth-control pills (either the old-time high-dose pills or the
current low-dose pills) may actually lower their risk of ovarian cancer
because the pill suppresses ovulation.
If you’ve had no pregnancies, you may have a higher risk of ovarian cancer
than women who have been pregnant simply because you’ve never experi-
enced prolonged periods of time during which you haven’t ovulated.
Recognizing the signs
Most of the symptoms of ovarian cancer seem unremarkable because they
can apply to any number of conditions, many of them harmless. Many women
first notice bloating in their abdomen. Other women experience nausea, vom-
iting, or gas that doesn’t respond to changes in diet. Frequent urination and
constipation are also possible symptoms as are abdominal or pelvic pain.
The problem is that the symptoms usually aren’t present until the disease
has entered an advanced stage.
Finding out for sure: Tests
If you experience any of the symptoms listed in the “Recognizing the signs”
section directly above, consider getting a pelvic exam and then a blood test
that looks for the presence of CA125. CA125 is an ovarian cancer antigen,
meaning that it’s a substance that causes the body to fight ovarian cancer. If
your CA125 levels are high, you may have ovarian cancer. Unfortunately,
193
Chapter 14: Reviewing Reproductive Cancers and Hormone Therapy

determining the meaning of high CA125 levels is tricky. Sometimes elevated
levels show up if you have endometriosis, ovarian cysts, or fibroids or if
you’re pregnant. Because this test produces a lot of false positives, most doc-
tors don’t use it very often. But you should discuss this test with your doctor
during your annual gynecological screening after you turn 50.
Just because your CA125 levels aren’t elevated doesn’t necessarily mean you
definitely don’t have ovarian cancer — 20 to 30 percent of women with ovar-
ian cancer don’t have elevated CA125 levels. Likewise, having elevated CA125
levels doesn’t mean that you absolutely have ovarian cancer, but it’s a reason
to further explore the cause of the results. 
Because CA125 screening can result in either a false positive or a false nega-
tive, doctors also rely on other tests to rule out ovarian cancer:
 Pelvic ultrasound: With this exam, a technician inserts a sounding
device into your vagina so he or she can view an image (a sonogram) of
your ovaries. Tumors can be identified with the sonogram.
 CAT scan: The CAT in CAT scan stands for computerized axial tomogra-
phy. This procedure lets your doctor get a graphic image of your ovaries
to check for tumors.
 Laparoscopy: This is a minor surgical procedure in which the doctor
makes a tiny incision in your belly button and inserts a scope to get a
better view of your ovaries. This exam is done under a general anesthe-
sia in an operating room on an outpatient basis.
Determining the role of hormones
Hormone therapy doubles your risk of dying of ovarian cancer. The good
news is that this risk is very low to begin with, so doubling it raises it from
about 1 percent to 2 percent. In a study of over 200,000 women, those who
had used unopposed estrogen (estrogen without the protective effects of
progestin) for ten years or more increased their risk of ovarian cancer. 
Birth-control pills may reduce your risks of ovarian cancer, mainly because
they suppress ovulation, not because of the estrogen or progesterone levels
in your bloodstream. Using birth-control pills for two years reduces your risk
by 40 to 50 percent. Using birth-control pills for five years reduces your risk
by 60 to 80 percent a risk reduction that can last for as long as 10 years from
the time you take your last pill.
Fertility drugs that increase the number of eggs released during ovulation or
increase the number of ovulations you have over a lifetime can increase your
risk of ovarian cancer. Again, it doesn’t seem to be the blood hormone levels
that create the problem so much as the physical wear and tear of ovulation.
194
Part III: Treating the Effects 

Assessing your risks
Ovarian cancer is fairly rare. It only affects 4 percent of women, most of
whom are over 50 years of age. But this form of cancer is quite deadly
because it usually goes unnoticed until the advanced stages of the disease.
Certain factors increase your risks for ovarian cancer:
 A family history of ovarian cancer (mother, sister, or daughter) or breast
cancer (mother or sister). Having the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene that
increases breast cancer risk also increases your risk of ovarian cancer
(you can read more about this gene in Chapter 13, “Checking out
Hormone Therapy and Breast Cancer”).
 The use of fertility drugs that stimulate the ovaries to release multiple
follicles during a single ovulation
 Being over the age of 50
 Being of Ashkenazi Jewish genetic heritage
 Taking hormone therapy for a number of years
 Having never been pregnant
Cancers Unaffected by Hormone Therapy
We’re including information on a couple of other cancers of the female per-
suasion even though hormone therapy has no known effects on a woman’s
risk of developing these cancers or her ability to recover from them.
So why are they here? We primarily include them so we don’t leave you won-
dering how hormones affect these reproductive organs. After all, only women
have these organs, so questioning the effects of hormone therapy on them is
natural.
Also, we think a book that addresses health issues facing menopausal women
would be incomplete without at least discussing these cancers.
Vaginal and vulvar cancers
Although cancers of the vagina or the vulva are rare, they occur with greater
frequency in midlife. Of women diagnosed with vulvar cancer, for instance, 85
percent are over 50. Fifteen percent, though, are under 40, so it’s important to
be aware of the risks at any age.
195
Chapter 14: Reviewing Reproductive Cancers and Hormone Therapy

One risk factor for vaginal cancer is having been exposed to the drug DES
while your mother was pregnant with you (DES was given in the 1950s to pre-
vent miscarriage, but has since been associated with a number of cancers
among both the women who took it and their daughters). Others include
having HPV (human papilloma virus), and being 30 or younger or 60 or older.
The main risk factor for vulvar cancer is HPV infection. Having a large
number of sexual partners (or having partners who have themselves had
many partners) increases your risk.
Using hormone therapy has not been found to increase the risk of vaginal or
vulvar cancers.
Cervical cancer
Cervical cancer (cancer of the cervix) can be detected early with a Pap smear.
Because human papilloma virus is associated with cervical cancer, practicing
safe sex can help to prevent it (but not with 100 percent certainty). Over
100,000 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed in the United States every
year, but the five-year survival rate after treatment is over 90 percent.
HT is not known to have any impact on cervical cancer.

I
n Chapters 12 through 14, we detail the relationships (positive, negative,
and neutral) between hormone therapy (HT) and cardiovascular disease
and several types of cancer. This chapter reviews a number of conditions you
may hear discussed in the same breath as HT. 
In this chapter, we define each of these conditions, discuss the signs and
symptoms, and review how the conditions have been linked to HT. We dis-
cuss the symptoms because, whether they’re linked to HT or not, these con-
ditions usually affect folks who are over the age of 40, so you may want to be
aware of them.
Dealing with Deep Vein Thrombosis 
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is probably not a phrase you use everyday, and if
you do hear it, we hope it’s from a doc on a TV drama and not from your own
doctor. Thrombosis is a five-dollar word for a blood clot (a lump of coagulated
blood) that forms in a deep vein and impairs the flow of blood through the
vein.
To find deep veins, you have to look no farther than your upper arms, your
legs, and your pelvis, but 95 percent of DVTs occur in your leg. These veins
lie deeper under the skin than surface veins and return more blood to the
heart. A clot in one of these veins can cause more complications than a clot
in surface veins.

Blood is designed to clot, right? Sure. When you cut yourself, normal clotting
keeps you from bleeding to death. But a clot forming inside a vein is up to no
good. If it breaks free from the wall of the vein and travels through your
bloodstream, it can travel to your lung. Here it can form a blockage called a
pulmonary embolism — pulmonary meaning it’s in the lungs and embolism
meaning a part of a blood clot. If the diagnosis is missed, pulmonary
embolism is fatal about 33 percent of the time.
Recognizing the signs
By far, the most troublesome and common cases of DVT occur in the leg. It’s
a good idea to acquaint yourself with possible symptoms:
 Pain or tenderness in your calf or thigh
 Redness: Your leg may look red as though you bumped it.
 Swelling in your whole leg or along a blood vessel
 Warmth: Your leg may feel warm to the touch.
These symptoms may signal a blood clot in your lung (pulmonary embolism):
 Chest pain that gets worse with a deep breath
 Cough that may bring up blood
 Sudden shortness of breath, even if you’re not exercising
About half of all blood clots come without any warning at all. If you do have
any of these symptoms, treat them as an emergency and seek medical atten-
tion immediately. Prompt treatment may save your life.
Determining the role of hormones
Deep vein thrombosis has long been linked to estrogen (that’s why you might
have heard blood clot risk warnings in connection with the use of birth con-
trol pills). 
A growing body of evidence exists (including that from the Women’s Health
Initiative [WHI] study) that shows a correlation between the use of conju-
gated estrogen therapy and blood-clotting problems. The risk was found to
be greater for women taking estrogen plus progestin (women on the hormone
had double the blood clot risk of women on placebos). Study participants
taking unopposed estrogen (with no added progestin) also had a somewhat
elevated (but not statistically significant) risk of blood clot. 
198
Part III: Treating the Effects 

Both of the WHI hormone studies were stopped early because of increased
health risks associated with hormone therapy, so it’s unknown whether these
patterns would have gotten stronger or changed with longer hormone use.
Clearly, though, hormones are associated with increased risk of DVT. The risk
is greatest during the first year of use.
Determining the reason behind the clotting connection is more controversial.
Some researchers believe that not all forms of estrogen would have this effect
on women. They believe that the type of estrogen (conjugated estrogen) is
responsible for the increase in clotting. Research in the future may show that
hormone therapy using natural estradiol (which the body uses more easily
than conjugated equine estrogen) won’t increase the risk of DVT or pul-
monary embolism. 
The method of hormone delivery may also affect DVT risk. The WHI studied
only women taking hormone therapy by mouth. Some evidence suggests that
the skin patch, which delivers the medication more directly into the blood-
stream, bypassing the liver, may be safer. The Kronos Early Estrogen
Prevention Study (KEEPS) was formed to examine this and other questions
about the safety of hormone therapy. A future edition of this book may be
able to answer this question. In the meantime, carefully consider the risk of
DVT and other blood-clotting problems, particularly if you’re taking or think-
ing of taking estrogen plus progestin therapy. 
Women with a history of blood-clotting problems should approach hormone
use with extreme caution. Many doctors will not prescribe hormone therapy
for women who have already had one or more blood clots, especially if they
have a genetic defect linked to clotting disorders. If you have had a blood
clot, and tests show that you have such a genetic predisposition to clots, you
should not use any estrogen-containing products. 
Dissecting Diabetes
Diabetes is characterized by high levels of glucose (sugar) in the blood. These
high concentrations of glucose are the result of the body’s inability to absorb
the sugar a person eats.
Insulin is a hormone that acts as the great facilitator in the blood-to-tissue
glucose-transfer process. When the glucose levels in your blood get relatively
high, your pancreas releases insulin to help your cells absorb the sugar in
your blood and use it for energy. When the pancreas produces insufficient
insulin, diabetes is the result. This can occur because either the body can’t
make enough insulin or the tissues quit responding to insulin and won’t take
in glucose. 
199
Chapter 15: Considering Hormone Therapy and Other Health Conditions

Two main kinds of diabetes exist:
 Type-1 diabetes: No one knows what causes Type-1 diabetes, but the
condition is genetic. (It was once called juvenile-onset diabetes because
the majority of sufferers are diagnosed before their 20th birthday.) In
Type-1 diabetes your pancreas doesn’t produce enough (or, in some
cases, any) insulin.
 Type-2 diabetes: This form of diabetes, in which your body produces
enough insulin but still cannot metabolize sugar properly, is the most
common and is most often diagnosed in people over 40 years of age.
Eighty percent of people with this form of diabetes are overweight.
Excess weight in combination with age is the greatest risk factor for
Type-2 diabetes.
Recognizing the signs
Over 18 million people in the United States live with diabetes. The American
Diabetes Association says that more than 5 million of these are people walk-
ing around with the disease who haven’t yet been diagnosed. Symptoms
include:
 Extreme thirst (causing you to drink an unusual amount of fluids)
 Frequent urination
 Constant hunger
 Unexpected weight loss
 Fatigue
 Itchy skin or genitals
 Pain or numbness in your extremities
 Slow-healing wounds
Determining the role of hormones
No one has yet demonstrated that hormone therapy actually leads to diabetes.
Some very small and short-term studies suggest that hormone therapy could
slightly increase your blood-glucose levels, but most other studies have found
absolutely no increase in risk of diabetes for women who take HT. Similarities
between diabetic and menopausal symptoms may contribute to a delay in diag-
nosis. Menopausal hormone changes can also increase the likelihood of low
200
Part III: Treating the Effects 

blood sugar episodes and contributing to vaginal and urinary-tract infections. If
you’re a diabetic and are also approaching or going through menopause, work
extra closely with your doctor to help you keep your blood sugar under control
(and read more about menopause and diabetes in Chapter 18).
Facing the Facts about Fibromyalgia
Ever heard of this one? Well, nearly 80 percent of the people who suffer from
fibromyalgia are women, and most of them are over 40 years of age. The laun-
dry list of symptoms may make you say, “You’ve gotta be kidding,” but we’re
not fibbing about fibromyalgia.
Fibromyalgia is not a disease, but a chronic condition in which you experi-
ence a broad group of symptoms including muscle and soft-tissue pain, ten-
derness, and fatigue. Fibromyalgia is normally first diagnosed between 30 and
50, but it can be later.
Recognizing the signs
Fibromyalgia symptoms are intensely felt and varied. They can include
 Stiffness and soreness, especially in the morning.
 Extremely tender places on your body, especially where tendons and
muscles meet (on the inside of your elbows and in your hips and knees,
for example). Pain in 11 of the 18 tender points is usually the threshold
doctors look for in diagnosing this condition.
 Difficulty getting a full night’s sleep.
 General fatigue.
 Irritability, mood changes, and depression.
 Problems with eye muscles. (Your eye may turn inward or close slightly.)
 Numbness, burning, or cold sensations in your hands and feet.
Some people with fibromyalgia also experience problems with their memory
or concentration, difficulty hearing, sensitivity to certain sounds, and may
suffer migraine headaches.
201
Chapter 15: Considering Hormone Therapy and Other Health Conditions

If you have or think you may have fibromyalgia, you may want to check out
Fibromyalgia For Dummies (Roland Staud with Christine Adamec, Wiley
Publishing, Inc.).
Determining the role of hormones
The cause of fibromyalgia isn’t well understood. Most scientists believe that
some type of hormonal imbalance causes the condition, but they can’t agree
on which hormones are unbalanced. Researchers are focusing their attention
on these areas:
 Brain chemicals that control mood and the sleep cycle
 Hormones released by the pituitary gland (which are also found in the
brain and are sensitive to estrogen)
 Deficiencies in growth hormones
A link to the female sex hormones also seems likely because fibromyalgia is
most likely to occur
 In women approaching menopause or who have gone through
menopause
 In women who have just had a baby (especially women over 35)
 A few years after women have had a tubal ligation or a hysterectomy
Getting the Goods on Gallbladder Disease
The gallbladder is a warehouse for bile, a greenish liquid that helps digest
fats. The gallbladder is supposed to take the bile from the liver and inject it
into the intestines (where it goes to work) via a bile duct. When too much
cholesterol is present in the bile, the cholesterol hardens, forming crystals
inside the gallbladder. The crystals then come together to form gallstones.
Recognizing the signs
Most people don’t even know they have gallstones. They experience no
symptoms and only find the stones when they’re tested for some other condi-
tion (such as ulcers or kidney stones). Any pain is usually like a dull ache or
cramping. But large or numerous gallstones can cause strong pain, vomiting,
202
Part III: Treating the Effects 

or nausea lasting from 30 minutes to several hours. You feel it in your upper
abdomen under your ribcage. Sometimes the pain radiates, moving all the
way down your lower back or up to your right shoulder. If gallstones cause
other infections, doctors usually remove your gallbladder, but gallstones
themselves are rarely life threatening.
If you have a high fever or chills, your bile duct (pathway to the small intes-
tine) may be inflamed or blocked. A blocked bile duct can also cause urine to
be dark yellow, stool to be light in color, and skin to take on a yellow cast. The
symptoms often occur at night or after eating (especially a high-fat meal).
Determining the role of hormones
Estrogen is believed to promote gallstones. Because estrogen, taken by
mouth, has to be processed in the liver before entering the bloodstream, it
tends to increases the level of LDL cholesterol (the bad stuff) in the bile.
Raising the level of cholesterol in the bile can increase the risk of gallstone
formation.
Using estrogen in patch form means estrogen doesn’t go through the liver.
This avoids adding cholesterol to the gallbladder and limits gallstone 
formation.
Thinking about Your Thyroid
Many of the 11 million or more Americans who have thyroid disease — either
an over- or an underactive thyroid gland — are women over 50. The thyroid,
a butterfly shaped gland at the base of your throat, is responsible for helping
to regulate growth and metabolism throughout the body. 
Recognizing the signs
Symptoms of hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid) include unexplained
weight gain, depression, memory loss, hair loss, heart palpitations, fatigue,
feeling cold all the time, and dry skin. If you have hyperthyroidism (overac-
tive thyroid), you may experience fatigue, insomnia, weight loss, intolerance
to heat, and jittery or nervous feelings. Both disorders may cause enlarge-
ment of the thyroid gland.
203
Chapter 15: Considering Hormone Therapy and Other Health Conditions

The symptoms of thyroid disease mimic those of other diseases and changes.
In fact, among women at midlife, symptoms are so similar to some
menopausal symptoms that you may dismiss them as just a normal part of
the change. Doctors recommend a thyroid function check (a simple blood
test) every five years. 
Determining the role of hormones
Remember that the thyroid gland is a part of your endocrine system, just as
your ovaries are. So it’s no surprise that estrogen and thyroxin interact with
each other, especially as your hormone levels begin to shift. Unopposed
estrogen can interfere with the working of thyroxin, leaving you in a hypothy-
roid state (remember, hypo means too little). The addition of progesterone
often eases the situation. If your thyroid functioning is perfectly normal,
estrogen therapy shouldn’t cause a problem. If you’re already taking thyroid
medication to help balance your thyroxin levels, though, work closely with
your caregiver to keep both thyroid hormones and estrogen at healthy levels. 
Looking at Lupus
Lupus is the short name for a disease called systemic lupus erythematosus.
Although lupus is a fairly rare disease, it’s much more common among
women than men — particularly women between the ages of 15 and 45.
Because lupus is a disease of the immune system, it attacks nearly every
organ in your body. The immune system normally protects your body from
infections. However, with lupus, the immune system starts attacking
“friendly” tissues in your own body. This wreaks havoc in your body, causing
tissue damage and illness.
Lupus is a complex disease, and researchers have yet to determine the cause.
The likely scenario is that no single cause exists. Instead, a combination of
genetic, environmental, and possibly hormonal factors may work together to
cause the disease.
The hormone connection is curious. If you look at the U.S. population in gen-
eral, only 1 out of 2,000 people have lupus. But, if you only consider women
between the ages of 14 and 45 years old, 1 in 250 has the disease. This leads
scientists to conclude that the female sex hormones are somehow involved.
204
Part III: Treating the Effects 

Recognizing the signs
Lupus can affect many parts of the body, and it often attacks the joints, skin,
kidneys, heart, lungs, blood vessels, and brain. Although people with the dis-
ease may have many different symptoms, some of the most common symp-
toms are
 Extreme fatigue
 Kidney problems
 Painful, swollen, inflamed joints (arthritis)
 Skin rashes and inflammation
 Unexplained fever
Many women who have lupus initially think that their swollen or stiff joints
are simply caused by arthritis. In fact, some researchers believe that lupus 
is related to rheumatoid arthritis. If left untreated, lupus can cause many
complications.
Determining the role of hormones
Given that women of childbearing age are at greatest risk of this disease, it’s
not surprising that researchers have found an increase in lupus among
women taking hormone therapy. The complicated nature of lupus and the
suggestion that estrogen replacement could trigger or exacerbate lupus has
led many doctors to be wary of prescribing it to women who have the 
disease. 
One large study found that women taking hormone therapy had double the
risk of developing lupus compared with menopausal women not taking hor-
mone therapy. The longer women used estrogen, the greater their risk of
developing the disease. Some of these findings, though, may have been com-
plicated by other factors in the women’s health histories, so some
researchers are uncertain about whether estrogen is uniformly bad for
women with lupus. Research is ongoing, but if you have a personal or family
history of lupus, work with your doctor to keep abreast of news about the
disease and, if needed, to identify alternatives to traditional hormone therapy
for menopausal symptom relief (check out Chapter 17 for information on
alternatives). 
205
Chapter 15: Considering Hormone Therapy and Other Health Conditions

Monitoring Migraines
Roughly 10 to 11 percent of people in the United States and Canada suffer
from migraines, and 70 percent of them are women. Most women who have
them are between the ages of 30 and 49; many have a family history of
migraines. 
Recognizing the signs
Migraines are not like everyday headaches. They’re a whole lot worse, but
they also have many qualities that distinguish them from more garden-variety
headaches. Migraine pain can be intense enough to cause nausea and vomit-
ing. Your head may throb and you may feel hot at the site of the pain, or
might feel pain on only one side of the head, and sensitivity to light, noise,
and strong odors. Some people also see auras, flashing lights or blind spots in
their field of vision.
Determining the role of hormones
Fluctuations in estrogen levels are one of the most common migraine trig-
gers. A sudden drop in estrogen brings on a migraine in many women. It’s
also worth noting that 
 Menstrual migraines generally occur during the part of the cycle when
estrogen levels drop.
 Women often report that migraines go away during pregnancy and after
menopause.
Many women first suffer these headaches during their reproductive years,
specifically a day or two before or on the first day or two of their period.
Other women get migraines around the time they ovulate, when estrogen
levels again drop. 
Headaches with other causes can feel a bit like migraines. A sudden
headache that’s significantly more painful than any you’ve ever had warrants
an emergency call to the doctor. Such pain may indicate a stroke or brain
aneurysm. 
The active form of estrogen in HT relieves the symptoms associated with
migraines. Women on a cyclical hormone therapy regimen (one in which you
quit taking estrogen for a few days each month) are more likely to have
migraines because of rapid drops in estrogen. Continuous hormone therapy
may prevent the headaches.
206
Part III: Treating the Effects 

Considering Cognition
Menopause moments. That’s what many of us call those brief episodes of for-
getfulness that seem to occur more and more often as we get older. We’ve all
been there: forgetting why we went into the other room, or buying a bag full
of groceries but forgetting the milk we went to the store for in the first place.
A certain amount of memory loss is a normal part of aging. For years, hor-
mone replacement was touted and prescribed for, among other things, its
ability to keep us mentally sharp in our perimenopausal years and beyond.
New findings, though, have turned this notion around 180 degrees.
Recognizing the signs
We’d bet there’s scarcely a person reading this who hasn’t secretly feared
that losing her keys or coming up blank on an acquaintance’s name heralds
the onset of Alzheimer’s disease. There’s a big difference, though, between
mild cognitive impairment (a little trouble with memory, concentration, cal-
culations, word retrieval, and the like) and dementia:
 Losing your car keys is normal; forgetting how to drive is not.
 Forgetting a friend’s birthday is normal. Not recognizing your friend
when you run into her isn’t.
 It’s normal to forget to put the milk away. It’s not normal to put the milk
away in the oven.
There are many causes of mild cognitive impairment, but there are also many
things that contribute to normal everyday forgetfulness: fatigue, insomnia,
poor nutrition, thyroid imbalances, depression, stress, and some medications
can all contribute to forgetfulness. So can simply having too much to do or
keep track of. It’s no wonder many of us end up calling one kid by the other
one’s name or forgetting the dry cleaning.
Determining the role of hormones
The Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) looked at whether
hormone use had an effect on mild cognitive impairment (forgetting your
keys) and on dementia (not knowing what a key is). The unofficial expecta-
tion was that estrogen would have a protective effect against cognitive
decline, but the findings surprised and dismayed the researchers:
207
Chapter 15: Considering Hormone Therapy and Other Health Conditions

 Women taking unopposed estrogen and those taking estrogen plus prog-
estin both experienced poorer cognitive functioning than did women
taking a placebo. The effect was strongest on women who had poorer
cognitive functioning to begin with.
 Both unopposed estrogen and estrogen plus progestin therapies were
associated with sharp increases in the risk of dementia. Almost half of
the dementia in both groups was due to Alzheimer’s disease.
It’s important to note that the WHIMS participants were all 65 or older. No
one can say for certain yet what the effects of hormones on the cognitive
functioning of younger women would be. Unless additional research yields
more positive outcomes, though, doctors are no longer prescribing hormone
therapy just to prevent cognitive decline or dementia.

Making the Decision about
Hormone Therapy
In This Chapter
 Recognizing a variety of opinions
 Connecting the studies to the headlines
 Weighing your options during perimenopause
 Weighing your options during menopause
W
e want to start this chapter by encouraging you to return to it periodi-
cally over the next few years. Your decisions about coping with peri-
menopause and menopause will probably change as your health issues
evolve, your priorities shift, and new options for controlling menopausal
symptoms (check out Chapter 4) and conditions such as osteoporosis (more
on this in Chapter 5) become available. This evaluation process doesn’t end
with a one-time pronouncement about whether to use or not use HT that you
have to follow for the rest of your life. You can (and should!) revisit your
alternatives periodically.
Outlining Attitudes about HT
Women have a lot of different feelings about hormone therapy (HT):
 “Natural is beautiful. I don’t need estrogen replacements to age gracefully.”
 “I tried to go the natural route, but living with these symptoms is a 
nightmare.”
 “I’d like to take advantages of the benefits of hormone therapy, but what
I hear about the risks really scares me. It feels like a no-win thing.”
 “You can have my hormones when you pry them out of my beautiful,
youthful hands!”
 “I’ve tried hormones, and they were awful. I guess I can put up with hot
flashes for a couple of years.” 

It’s certainly possible to hold two (or more) beliefs about hormones at the
same time, and your opinions and concerns may shift as you learn more or
your symptoms wax and wane. Your ideas will also be influenced by what you
hear on the news about hormone research, your doctor’s approach to prescrib-
ing them, and experiences your mom, sisters, and friends have had with them.
Don’t be surprised if your friends and relations try to influence your decisions
about hormone therapy. You may feel pressured to use — or not use — HT,
depending on who’s doing the talking and what her experience was. If your
sister found happiness in using HT, or your next door neighbor had a bad
reaction to it, they may just assume you’ll have the same experience. Keep in
mind, too, that the controversy surrounding the use of HT may make some
women feel better if you do what they are doing. You may feel pressured when
you run up against an over-the-top cheerleader for HT, or someone who insists
its use is the root of all evil. If this is the case, acknowledge their experience
(“I’m so glad the hormones made your hot flashes less of a problem”), thank
them for their advice (“It’s great to be able to learn what worked for other
people”), then quietly slip off and make the decision that’s best for you.
No two women will have the same set or severity of symptoms, the same per-
sonal or family medical history, and the same beliefs and expectations about
menopause. That means that what will work best for you might not be the
same approach that worked for your mom or your friend at work.
Taking Everything into Consideration
The purpose of HT is to bring your hormones into a “healthy” balance after
your ovaries quit producing enough estrogen. This balance can help to keep
discomfort and anxiety in check. 
210
Part III: Treating the Effects 
Revisiting WHI answers — and questions
Early results from the Women’s Health Initiative
(WHI) study, released in 2002 when the first edi-
tion of this book was being written, seemed to
put the kibosh on hormone therapy (HT). Not
only did a combination of estrogen and prog-
estin not lower the risk of cardiovascular dis-
ease, it actually increased the risk of breast
cancer, heart attacks, strokes, and blood clots.
Another part of the study found that taking
estrogen alone led to an increase in stroke.
Based on these findings, the National Institutes
of Health, the sponsor of the study, terminated
both parts of the hormone trial several years
ahead of schedule. Although the participants
were told to stop taking their hormones,
researchers are continuing to follow up on
women in both groups to assess any long-term
effects of hormone use.

211
Chapter 16: Making the Decision about Hormone Therapy
The WHI study was designed carefully to mini-
mize the risk of coming up with outcomes that
were due to chance or coincidence. It was
designed to study a huge number of women
(more than 161,000 of them) over a 15-year
period. No study, however, is perfect or will
come up with results that are universally applic-
able to all women. Clearly, the findings of this
study raise big and bright red flags about the
use of hormone therapy. Concerns are great
enough that the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has mandated that a warning be incorpo-
rated into the packaging of hormone therapy
products (see the later sidebar “Heeding the
warnings”). 
That said, there are a few legitimate questions
the WHI findings can’t answer:
 What are the risks and benefits of hormone
use for younger women? Thee WHI studied
women between the ages of 50 and 79, but
many women begin to take hormones
during their perimenopausal years, often
well before the age of 50. At least one WHI
finding, a hint of lower risk of cardiovascu-
lar disease among women taking unop-
posed estrogen, applied only to women at
the younger end of the study’s age spec-
trum, so age may well be a factor. This may
be an especially important question for
women who go through menopause at an
extremely early age. Women in this group
almost always begin hormone therapy at a
young age and may stay on it for decades.
 What do the WHI findings tell us about the
effects of taking hormones other than the
ones studied? In a word, nothing. This isn’t
through negligence on the part of the
research group. It made sense for them to
study the forms of hormones most often
taken by women in the United States: con-
jugated equine (equine means they were
derived from horses, specifically from the
urine of pregnant mares) estrogen plus
MPA progestin. Other major studies per-
formed in the 1980s and 1990s showed that
horse-derived estrogens might produce
higher risks of heart disease than the nat-
ural estradiol form of estrogen. Some
experts believe that treating menopausal
symptoms with estrogens more closely
matching those of actual human women
might yield quite different results and fewer
risks. Bottom line? We just don’t know yet.
 What are the risks of short-term use of hor-
mones? Women in the WHI studies took
their hormones for seven or eight years. The
FDA now recommends taking hormones —
if at all — for only as long as is necessary
to ease women past the stage in which
menopausal symptoms are most trouble-
some. Granted, the study did, in some
cases, discover risks (for a rise in the inci-
dence of coronary heart disease, for exam-
ple) occurring within the first year of use.
We still don’t know much about the use of
hormones for brief periods of time.
 Would the potential risks be as severe if
hormones were taken in a different form?
The answer (so far) to this question is a
resounding “maybe.” Women in the WHI
took their hormones orally, in pill form, so
the medication was processed by organs in
the body (especially in the liver) instead of
being delivered more directly to the blood-
stream. But we know that estrogen admin-
istered vaginally, for instance, seems to
ease vaginal atrophy without a rise in the
risk factors associated with oral estrogen
use. The Kronos Early Estrogen Study
(KEEPS) is, as this edition of the book is
being written, looking at the benefits and
risks of administering hormones through a
transdermal patch you wear on your skin
(for the record, they’re also looking at a par-
ticipant age range that includes younger
women than the WHI did).

But taking hormone therapy does present health risks. Estrogen encourages
the growth of some breast cancers and may also be a problem for women
who have or are at risk for gallbladder or liver problems, blood clots, or 
undiagnosed vaginal bleeding. 
So how do you decide? The information in this chapter (and other HT-related
chapters in this book) can help you perform a cost-benefit analysis that
includes your personal concerns, habits, and health profile.
If you have a family or personal history of osteoporosis or colorectal 
cancer, this may be a mark in the “pros” column as you weigh the benefits of
hormone therapy against its potential risks. (Check out Chapter 17 for infor-
mation on treating osteoporosis without hormones.)
As with any personal decision, you also have to consider your values,
lifestyle preferences, and personal preferences. Also, look at your medical
history and that of your family. You may eventually face the same medical
problems that affect your parents, siblings, or grandparents. We help you
sort through these issues, too.
Weighing the Benefits and Risks of HT
Most women consider hormone therapy (HT) chiefly because their symp-
toms make them uncomfortable. Only you can decide whether this disruption
warrants use of a medication that might have other effects on your health.
(Check out the “Figuring out just how bad it really is” sidebar later in this
chapter to get an objective look at your symptoms.) It’s important, though, to
know what other potential benefits and risks are associated with taking hor-
mones. Later in this chapter we’ll give you the dirt on how hormones can
affect your heart health and your risk of breast cancer. 
Rounding up the benefits 
First, though, here’s a quick overview of some other hormone-related health
findings.
Controlling perimenopausal symptoms — in both its unopposed estrogen
form and combination (estrogen plus progestin) form — relieves peri-
menopausal and menopausal symptoms and protects your body. HT has
been found to be quite effective at relieving
 Hot flashes
 Insomnia and fitful sleep due to hot flashes or night sweats 
 Vaginal dryness and atrophy (thinning and shrinking)
212
Part III: Treating the Effects 

Some evidence points to the fact that menopausal symptoms are actually
worse during perimenopause than after you’re officially menopausal. The
wild hormone fluctuations are probably the culprit. But that means that, if
you’re like most women, your symptoms will subside eventually. If your
symptoms are driving you crazy now, though, or if you are in the small group
of women who continue to have some symptoms after menopause, work with
your healthcare provider to find a level of hormone or alternative treatment
(read up on other treatments for symptoms in Chapter 17) that brings relief.
Avoiding bone breaks
WHI results indicate that taking HT (estrogen plus progestin or estrogen
alone) dramatically reduces the risk of osteoporosis and the debilitating
results of the disease in Caucasian and Asian women. Evidence from the WHI
shows that hormone therapy (estrogen plus progestin) has a beneficial effect
on women’s bones. Specifically:
 Women taking combination hormone therapy experienced 24 percent
fewer overall fractures and 33 percent fewer hip fractures during the
years of the study.
 Bone density, measured in the hip, increased 3.7 percent after the first
three years among women taking combination hormone therapy (and
only 0.14 percent among women taking a placebo.
 Women taking unopposed estrogen were also at decreased risk for 
fractures.
 Findings applied both to women felt to be at high risk of osteoporosis
and those judged to be at lower risk.
The protective effects of HT on your bones only last as long as you take hor-
mones. So when you stop — wham — you begin losing bone mass quickly.
Keeping colon cancer at bay
Here’s another one of those “we don’t know exactly why, but it does” benefits
of HT. While you take HT, you have a slightly lower risk of developing colon
cancer. After you discontinue using hormones, the protection gradually disap-
pears. Specifically, findings for women taking estrogen plus progestin included:
 A 44 percent decline in the risk for colorectal cancer 
 Among the cases of colorectal cancer that were found in the hormone
and placebo groups, there was no difference in the characteristics of the
cancers
Strangely, though, the tumors found among the women in the hormone ther-
apy group were more likely to be advanced when first discovered (more
likely to have spread to the lymph nodes and other parts of the body). The
spread (metastasis) of cancer in this way is more likely to indicate a poorer
outcome. So far, researchers are unable to explain this finding. 
213
Chapter 16: Making the Decision about Hormone Therapy

Corralling the risks
HT also presents some additional risks to women:
 It increases your risk of endometrial cancer if you take estrogen with-
out also taking progesterone. 
 It increases your risk of gallbladder problems. HT increases your risk
of gallstones. The risk can be lowered by using a patch instead of a pill.
 It increases your risk of breast cancer. Recent WHI findings indicate
that taking combination HT (estrogen plus progesterone) increases your
risk for breast cancer by as much as 24 percent. The evidence is stack-
ing up on this issue (see Chapter 13).
 It increases your risk of deep-vein blood clots. Women who took HT
during the WHI combination therapy trials had two times the risk of
blood clots as women taking placebo. Among women taking estrogen
alone, there was also a pattern suggesting greater risk for blood clots
that cause pulmonary emboli (blood clots that travel to the lungs).
Chapter 15 talks about the relationship between clots and HT.
 It increases your risk of dementia. In the WHI trials, this was true both
for the estrogen plus progestin study and the estrogen alone trial. Risk
was greater for women who already had some degree of cognitive
impairment.
Getting to the Heart of Cardiac Health
One of the most dramatic changes in the way researchers and healthcare
providers think about hormone therapy in the past few years is the change in
our understanding of heart disease. Because heart disease is the most common
cause of death among women, this is no small matter. For years doctors
assumed that estrogen (and thus hormone therapy of both major types — with
and without the addition of estrogen) provided a significant level of protection
against heart disease. This assumption was so strong that many healthcare
providers routinely prescribed hormone therapy to help prevent heart disease.
The WHI findings on hormone therapy and heart disease have helped us to
rethink our former assumptions. In fact, the Food and Drug Administration
now recommends that HT (in either form) should no longer be prescribed for
the prevention of heart disease. There are some differences, though, in find-
ings related to combination therapy use and the use of unopposed estrogen.
Read on to find out about research that applies to your situation.

Part III: Treating the Effects 

Going along on estrogen alone
Just a few years back, most experts would have said that taking hormone
therapy provided a strong measure of protection against coronary heart dis-
ease and related concerns, such as stroke, peripheral artery disease (PAD),
and deaths from heart attack. Since then, information from the WHI has
raised serious concerns about the link between coronary heart disease and
HT. Here are the major heart-related findings from the WHI for women (who
have had hysterectomies) taking estrogen alone:
 The WHI results show that estrogen provided no protection against
coronary heart disease, heart attack, or coronary death, especially
among women 60 and older.
 For women in the younger end of the study group only, there was a non-
significant suggestion of lower rates of heart attack and a decrease in
the need for procedures for clearing arterial blockage.
The WHI study included women between the ages of 50 and 79. Though more
age-specific research is needed, there are a few suggestions that the use of HT
may have different outcomes for women at different ends of this age range.
Based on these findings, the jury is still pretty much out on the issue of estro-
gen use for women who can use the unopposed version (that is, women who
no longer have a uterus and are thus free of the endometrial cancer risk asso-
ciated with estrogen use). If you’re in this group, especially if you are younger
than 60, talk with your doctor about whether the benefits of short-term use of
estrogen therapy might not outweigh the risks.
If you still have a uterus and thus the only form of hormone therapy available
to you is estrogen plus progestin, the FDA recommends that you not take hor-
mones for the prevention of heart disease. Given the increased risk of heart
disease, whether you want to consider them at all will probably depend on
the severity of your menopausal symptoms and your level of risk for other
diseases, such as colorectal cancer and osteoporosis.
Hormone therapy shouldn’t be used to prevent or treat heart disease or
heart attack. You should also discuss with your doctor any plan to use hor-
mone therapy if you have a history of heart disease or heart attack. The first
line of defense against heart disease and heart attack should be a healthy
diet, regular exercise, and an overall healthy lifestyle.
What about other types of cardiovascular disease such as high cholesterol
and triglyceride levels and hypertension (high blood pressure)? Glad you
asked. Estrogen is a mixed bag as far as cholesterol and triglycerides are 
concerned:
215
Chapter 16: Making the Decision about Hormone Therapy

 Estrogen lowers LDL levels (by as much as 15 percent in one study).
 Some forms of estrogen raise HDL (“good” cholesterol) levels.
 Oral estrogen seems to increase triglycerides (boo), but the patch tends
to lower triglycerides (yeah).
If you have a problem with blood cholesterol and triglycerides, you need to
find the right type of estrogen to keep them in check.
Estrogen’s benefits are clearer in relation to high blood pressure. It helps
dilate blood vessels and improve blood flow, both of which lower your blood
pressure.
The WHI unopposed estrogen study was stopped because of the high inci-
dence of stroke in the group taking estrogen (compared with that of the
group taking a placebo). 
Adding progestin to the mix 
Now, when you add progestin (synthetic forms of the hormone progesterone)
to the hormone therapy, everything changes. Progestin seem to dull the posi-
tive effects of estrogen on your cardiovascular system. 
For women taking combination therapy (estrogen plus progestin):
 There was an overall 24 percent increase in the risk of coronary heart
disease
 There was an 81 percent increase in the risk of coronary heart disease in
the very first year of taking hormones
Your risk of heart attack increases while taking combination HT (estrogen
plus progestin), but you’re not more likely to die of a heart attack while
taking HT (compared with women who don’t take any form of hormones).
Here are the findings related to the combination HT (estrogen plus progestin)
on your blood:
 It lowers HDL cholesterol (when taken in pill form).
 It raises triglycerides (when taken in pill form).
It’s important to note that researchers stopped the WHI study, but they didn’t
put the breaks on because participants were in grave danger of dying from a
heart attack or heart disease. (Although use of hormone therapy seemed to
increase the risk of heart attack, it didn’t increase the risk of dying from a
heart attack.) Researchers halted the estrogen plus progestin study because
of the increased risk in breast cancer.
216
Part III: Treating the Effects 

Before the WHI study, most doctors agreed that women could lower their risk
of cardiovascular problems by using HT. Most doctors now agree that combi-
nation HT shouldn’t be the first line of defense against cardiovascular dis-
ease. Here’s what we know:
 The risk of stroke doesn’t increase during the first year of HT use, but it
increases over time — after the first year for about five years (even in
healthy women).
 Your risk of suffering a heart attack increases while taking HT, but you’re
not more likely to die of a heart attack while taking HT.
Assessing Your Personal Risk
As you approach menopause, the risks and rewards of HT may look different
to you. The pros and cons may become more balanced; you may even throw
up your hands and say, “Damned if I do, damned if I don’t.” What can you do
to sort through the decision-making process? Read on. While you’re reading,
take your family medical history and personal health concerns into account.
And keep in mind that you can always take a fresh look at the situation next
month or next year.
Some studies indicate that use of HT slightly increases your risk of breast
cancer (other studies show no effect whatsoever — so it’s still controversial).
If you’re worried about your risk of breast cancer, take an objective look at
your personal risk factors for the disease.
It’s important to realize that risk is not the same as certainty. We all know
people who smoked and drank and lived a long life and others who lived
healthy and exercised and died of a heart attack well before their time. But, in
between these unlikely extremes, you can evaluate your risk factors and try
to take some steps to improve your chances of preventing disease.
Many women choose to weigh their risk of osteoporosis and cardiovascular
disease against their risk of breast cancer because HT protects you from
osteoporosis but may raise your risk for breast cancer, and depending on
what form of HT you take, it may or may not help protect you from heart 
disease.
If you are at great risk of osteoporosis but have few risk factors for breast
cancer or cardiovascular disease, HT may be for you. If you’re at great risk
for breast cancer, you may want to consider other alternatives for protecting
your bones and heart. Chapters 17 through 19 give you some great ideas
about alternatives.
217
Chapter 16: Making the Decision about Hormone Therapy

Some of the risk factors for each of the conditions are things that you can
control by modifying your lifestyle, eating habits, or other behaviors. You can
lower these risks immediately by making some changes now.
Summing Up the Studies
If you’ve made it this far through the chapter, you’ve digested a lot of infor-
mation, and your plate is probably still full. We thought we’d included a little
synopsis at this point to help you separate your peas from your potatoes,
regroup, re-energize, and re-weigh the risks and benefits associated with hor-
mone therapy.
You should realize that the best-studied type of HT is the regimen in which
women take a daily pill that contains both conjugated equine estrogen and
MPA progestin. Studies of other regimens are more scattered in terms of the
size of the study group and the types of HT investigated. So these results are
heavily biased toward the benefits and risks of combination therapy using
conjugated estrogen and MPA progestin. (For more information on all the dif-
ferent types of therapies and hormones, check out Chapter 10.) For now,
Table 16-1 provides a rough summary of the benefits and risks of HT.

Part III: Treating the Effects 

Presenting the Options 
for Perimenopause
In the following sections, we present several ways that women deal with peri-
menopausal symptoms. Even though we group them into individual options,
you may want to mix and match. For example, we discuss diet and exercise,
herbal solutions, and HT in separate sections. But adopting better eating and
exercise habits can only enhance the positive aspects of herbs or HT.
Option 1: The lifestyle solution
If you’re perimenopausal and your symptoms annoy you but rarely interfere
with your life, some lifestyle changes may be enough to alleviate them. Many
women find that some of the symptoms of perimenopause fade with a
renewed focus on getting or staying fit.
Eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly, as described in Chapters 18
and 19, will boost your immune system, help maintain bone density, and keep
your blood lean so you lower your risk of cardiovascular disease and reverse
some of the effects of low estrogen levels that define menopause. A healthy
diet and exercise trim you down and improve your state of mind. 
219
Chapter 16: Making the Decision about Hormone Therapy
Heeding the warnings
The strongest statement the federal Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) can make about
potential dangers associated with a medication
(other than withdrawing a product from the
market) is the issuing of what they call a “black
box” warning. Early in 2003, the FDA mandated
the use of these notices on hormone medication
packaging. The warnings vary according to the
specific product, but they all include statements
to the effect that
 Estrogens increase the risk of getting uter-
ine cancer.
 Hormone therapy, with or without prog-
estins, should not be used to prevent heart
attacks, heart disease, blood clots, or
strokes.
The warnings on your package may vary,
depending on which specific type of HT you
take. Read any black box notice carefully, take
its warnings seriously, and discuss with your
healthcare provider any part of the warning you
don’t understand. As with any hormone med-
ication, have regular checkups and discuss with
your doctor on a regular basis whether you con-
tinue to need to take the product.

Option 2: The herbal solution
For most women, perimenopausal symptoms are not life-threatening so using
drugs and hormones to relieve symptoms may seem like using a shotgun to
kill mosquitoes. You may want to consider some non-HT alternatives to allevi-
ate your symptoms. These alternatives can be as diverse as herbs, relaxation
techniques, and vaginal lubricants. Herbs of interest for relieving peri-
menopausal symptoms include black cohosh, soy, dong quai, and ginseng.
We cover herbal solutions and relaxation techniques in detail in Chapter 17.
Option 3: The HT solution
Maybe you aren’t wild about taking medication, but your symptoms are inter-
fering with your quality of life; HT may be the answer. HT has been shown to
relieve hot flashes because estrogen helps regulate body temperature. In
addition, estrogen improves sleep and lowers anxiety by increasing the pro-
duction and extending the action of serotonin (a brain chemical that regulates
mood and activity level). Serotonin boosts concentration, improves pain tol-
erance, enhances memory, and regulates adrenaline so you avoid heart palpi-
tations. Progesterone has been added to the HT regimen to reduce the risk of
endometrial cancer that estrogen-only HT would present.
Many women choose to take HT to get rid of their annoying perimenopausal
symptoms and may get added protection for their bones and hearts.
If you decide that HT is for you, remember that perimenopausal symptoms
eventually subside for most women. You may decide to limit your use of HT
to perimenopause. 
Remember that many types of estrogen and progesterone (and combinations
thereof) are available. It may take time to try some different formulas to find
the correct therapy for you. When it comes to HT, one size does not fit all.
Quitting HT
Most experts now recommend taking HT at the lowest dose possible and for
the shortest time available. If you’re taking HT when you hit menopause, it
may be a good time to re-evaluate your situation and consider the benefits
you want to gain from hormone therapy. As you reconsider your decision,
talk to your doctor. Do not simply stop taking HT. If you elect to quit taking
HT, your doctor is the person in the best position to guide you.
220
Part III: Treating the Effects 

Differences exist between the benefits and risks of long-term HT use and
short-term HT use (see Table 16-1 for a summary). The risks you’re most wor-
ried about may not be a problem (or as big a problem) if you’re taking HT for
the short term — just long enough to get through the perimenopausal symp-
toms. With the recent study results in from the Women’s Health Initiative,
preventing cardiovascular disease no longer seems like a good reason to
begin HT. To reduce heart disease and cardiovascular risks, start by improv-
ing your diet, getting more exercise, and quitting smoking. These methods
are absolutely safe and proven to reduce your risk of cardiovascular prob-
lems (including heart attack and stroke). After you make it through the hot
flashes (with or without the use of HT) and you stop having periods, it’s time
to consider what you want to do about preventing health problems associ-
ated with sustained, low levels of estrogen. This is a good time to re-evaluate
your regimen and consult with your healthcare advisor.
Recognizing Whether HT Is for You
Making the decision to take HT should only come after you’ve studied all the
issues: your personal risk factors, medical history, and priorities. Are you pri-
marily interested in reducing hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms?
In maintaining a youthful appearance? In keeping the va-va-voom in your sex
life? In reducing your risk of osteoporosis? In the end, only you — in consulta-
tion with your doctor and taking all of these variables into consideration —
can decide what is right for you. 
No one facet of your health history and lifestyle can point you with certainty
to the right answer about whether to use HT. You can, however, use the state-
ments in the sections below to help you identify your greatest concerns and
priorities. Knowing what these are can help point you in the right direction.
Deciding that HT may not be for you
Read the following statements and see if you agree with them. If you’re in
agreement with a lot of these statements, you may want to try HT alterna-
tives including a healthy diet, exercise, herbal alternatives, and other preven-
tative treatments:
I’ve had breast cancer.
My mother, sister, or daughter has had breast cancer.
I have coronary heart disease.
221
Chapter 16: Making the Decision about Hormone Therapy

I don’t have or can live with my menopausal symptoms.
I have a history of blood clots, DVT, or pulmonary embolism. 
I hate taking medication and believe herbs can do a better job than drugs.
I typically eat a healthy, balanced diet.
I exercise regularly, and I’m successful at maintaining my target weight.
I think physicians and pharmaceutical companies are just out to make
money from women going through menopause.
I haven’t gone to a doctor in years and don’t plan on starting now.
My mom had an easy menopause and I think I will, too.
I have few risk factors for osteoporosis or colorectal cancer.
Thinking you may be ready for HT
No one wants to take medicine just to take it. Women who take HT during
menopause are concerned about preventing disease or eliminating discom-
fort. To find a successful HT regimen, you must have confidence in your
doctor and understand why you’re making this decision. Even if you decide
to try HT, you may have to experiment for a while (under your doctor’s guid-
ance) to find the right hormone regimen.
222
Part III: Treating the Effects 
Figuring out just how bad it really is
Just how bad are your perimenopausal symp-
toms? This is a pretty subjective area. One
woman may say hers aren’t that bad while
another who has precisely the same number of
hot flashes in a week might call hers unbear-
able. A recent poll (sponsored in part by a phar-
maceutical company that makes women’s
healthcare medications) says that the vast
majority of women find their menopausal symp-
toms to be much worse than they expected, but
an independent study published at about the
same time says most menopausal women
describe their quality of life as good. This little
quiz is designed to help you decide whether
perimenopausal symptoms are interfering with
your quality of life. There are no right or wrong
answers and all of these are normal — you
decide how bothersome your own symptoms
are for you. 
How often do you experience hot flashes or
night sweats?
 Never — cool as a cucumber here.
 Four or five times a month, but I can cope.
This, too, will pass.
 Daily — my boss is going to fire me if I
adjust the office thermostat one more time.
 Constantly — I’m thinking of having central
air conditioning installed in my bra.

If you find yourself agreeing with some of these statements, you may want to
consider HT:
I have a lot of osteoporosis in my family.
My mother or grandmother broke her hip.
My hot flashes and mood swings are driving me crazy.
I’ve been taking HT for a year now and haven’t had any trouble.
I’m a junk-food junkie and I hate to exercise.
My sex life is a huge problem because I’m not in the mood for it and 
intercourse is painful.
Given my risk factors, I think that I’m at greater risk for osteoporosis than
breast cancer.
223
Chapter 16: Making the Decision about Hormone Therapy
How often do you experience interrupted sleep
or insomnia?
 About the same as I have in the past; sleep-
ing is one of the things I do best.
 I get a full eight hours — in two-hour
blocks.
 Often enough that I have the TV schedule
between midnight and 4 a.m. memorized.
 Sleep? Who sleeps?
Do you feel irritable, anxious, or apprehensive?
 Nah, I’m my usual charming self.
 Irritable? Anxious? Why? Do I seem anxious
to you? No, really, tell me!
 I’m mostly okay, but telephone company
ads make me cry.
 WHY?! WHAT MAKES YOU ASK? NONE OF
YOUR DARN BUSINESS!
Are you experiencing vaginal dryness, burning,
or itching?
 Hadn’t ever crossed my mind — things are
fine.
 Hmm, now that you mention it . . ..
 Is this what they meant when they said,
“love hurts?” Not tonight, honey. Probably
not tomorrow night, either.
 Even during everyday activities I feel dry
and uncomfortable.
Do you experience any other perimenopausal
problems, such as headaches, prickly skin,
leaking urine when laughing or exercising, 
forgetfulness, a fluttery heart . . .
 Uh . . . no. Do you?
 No, not me. Well, okay, once in a while.
 You kidding? Where do I trade in my panty
liners for some Depends?
 Yes, yes, yes, yes, and yes. What else is on
that list?
If you experience many of these symptoms 
but they appear at about the same time each
month — prior to your period — and then go
away for some length of time during each 
menstrual cycle, you probably have premen-
strual syndrome rather than perimenopausal
symptoms.

I think there are a lot of HT options, and I’m good at sticking to a medical
plan.
I’m not big on herbal remedies to prevent or treat serious diseases.
I have a good rapport with my doctor, and I’d like to give HT a try.
If you still have concerns or questions, talk to your physician. Don’t simply
stop a therapy you’re presently taking. Your medical advisor may be able to
help you interpret the information you read about a study. Don’t base your
decision about HT — or any medication, for that matter — on TV commer-
cials or newspaper articles.

Non-Hormone Therapies

 Soothing your privates with lubricants
 Beefing up your bones without estrogen
 Heading toward a healthy heart without hormones
W
e’d hate for you to go away thinking that, when it comes to treating
menopausal symptoms, your choices are hormones or nothing. At
least one-third of perimenopausal and menopausal women in the United
States use some form of nonconventional therapy (medical therapies not com-
monly used or previously accepted in conventional Western medicine) to
treat their symptoms.
There are a number of alternatives to hormone therapy for women seeking
help coping with perimenopausal symptoms such as hot flashes or vaginal
dryness. There are also plenty of women who — because they can’t or prefer
not to take hormones — look for alternative treatments for concerns
common among women in their menopausal years. There are, for instance,
things you can do to lower your risks of osteoporosis or heart disease. 
If you’re using (or considering using) nonconventional therapy, let your
physician know what you’re taking or planning to take. Natural supplements
are still medicines — they can affect the way your body functions, just as
conventional medications can. Treat these nonconventional approaches as
seriously as you treat other medications — maybe even more seriously,
because there are few FDA controls on them, and typically they haven’t
undergone safety studies.

One way to approach nontraditional therapy is to use it in conjunction with
traditional medicine. We devote a number of chapters in this book to hor-
mone therapy (HT) and traditional approaches to dealing with the symptoms
of perimenopause and menopause, but in this chapter we talk about the use
of herbs, mind-body therapies, and acupuncture. 
If eliminating the annoying symptoms of perimenopause were all that it took
to keep women healthy during their menopausal years and beyond, (and if
the alternative therapies worked reliably and effectively on all women), alter-
native therapies would be a good bet (though lack of controlled studies on
most of them mean we can’t adequately compare their complications and
risks to those of hormone therapies. But staying healthy during peri-
menopause and menopause requires the prevention of more serious health
issues that begin when your body starts producing lower levels of estrogen.
That means we’ll also be covering non-hormonal ways to help protect the
health of your bones and cardiovascular system.
Weighing the Pros and Cons of Herbs
Interest in nonconventional therapy is growing. Some women enjoy taking a
more holistic approach to their lives, menopause included, and others have
made the choice to avoid at least some forms of conventional medicine (pos-
sibly including hormone therapy) for various reasons. In this section, we
detail why more doctors are coming around to considering some herbal ther-
apies as an acceptable treatment for some patients. 
Complementary and alternative medicines are the names we use to refer to
nonconventional therapies in this chapter: complementary if you use them in
addition to conventional medicine and alternative if you use them in place of
conventional medicine. Though we sometimes think of them as fringe or new-
age therapies, many have long been part of a traditional way of health care in
a much older sense of “traditional.” In the days before it was possible to run
to the corner drugstore to get a prescription filled, many people relied suc-
cessfully on plant-based medicines to help heal what ailed them.
Some therapies that were once considered nonconventional may be adopted
by conventional medicine after years of research and treatment success.
Nonconventional courses of treatment have become so popular that the
National Institutes of Health now has a branch devoted to studying them. The
National Center for Complimentary and Alternative Medicine (http://
nccam.nih.gov) conducts research and supports public information on the
pros and cons of many alternative therapies. Today, safely exploring these
types of treatment is becoming easier and easier.
226
Part III: Treating the Effects 

Considering conventional concerns
Conventional medicine’s concerns about herbal treatments deal largely with
the lack of scientific studies of the plants. Some herbs have been studied in
controlled experiments (especially in Germany, where herbs are better stud-
ied and integrated into conventional medicine than they are here), but many
have not, so researchers aren’t sure whether they work any better than a
sugar pill. 
Because any plant therapy sold as medicine in the United States must go
through a rigorous approval process involving testing and clinical trial, most
manufacturers of such processes opt instead to market their products as
dietary supplements. The FDA has no authority over the sale of these prod-
ucts unless they have been demonstrated to cause harm. This lack of over-
sight means there is no guarantee that a given product contains what the
label says it does, contains the strength indicated on the packaging, or is free
from contaminants such as dirt, other herbs, lead, or traces of prescription
drugs. Whenever possible, look for standardized supplements that have been
verified by private programs such as U.S. Pharmacopoeia, NSF International,
ConsumerLab.com, or Good Housekeeping’s Seal of Approval.
Conventional medicine is also concerned about dosage: how much of a given
herb to take. Even if the packaging lists a recommended dose, it will certainly
not be tailored to your specific concern, body size, or symptom severity. A
given package may even contain more or less of the product than is adver-
tised on the label. In 2006, for example, a consumer testing laboratory that
discovered several popular brands of ginseng contained far lower concentra-
tions of the herb than promised (even though at least one of them was adver-
tised as being “extra strength”).
Seeking safety in herbal therapy
Throughout this book, we often recommend that you seek the advice of a
healthcare expert before embarking on a course (or change of course) of
treatment. When it comes to herbs, though, it’s not always clear who the
expert is. Your regular doctor or gynecologist is a good first choice. Many
conventional practitioners are open to discussing complementary and alter-
native medicines with you. Chances are your doctor has many patients taking
these products, and will be happy to advise you in this regard. Your pharma-
cist, too, may be able to answer questions about herbs.
You may want to speak with an herbalist. Here, however, some caution is
called for. There are currently no national standards or licensing require-
ments for people wishing to call themselves herbalists. Anyone could hang
227
Chapter 17: Taking an Alternate Route: Non-Hormone Therapies

out a shingle advertising their services as an herbalist — such a person
might be learned and wise, or . . . not. That said, there are many schools and
universities that teach herbal medicine, and the American Herbalist’s Guild
certifies herbalists who meet their rigorous qualifications for membership
(look for “AHG” after a practitioner’s name). Your physician may be able to
recommend an herbalist to you, but so might the clerk at your local natural
food’s store. You can also check directly with an organization such as the
AHG (www.americanherbalistsguild.com). Just be discriminating.
Germany has relatively strict guidelines for regulating herbal supplements.
Their health authorities use the guideline of reasonable certainty, which
means that they consider the experiences of general practitioners — not just
clinical trials — in evaluating a plant drug. The Complete German Commission
E Monographs: Therapeutic Guide to Herbal Medicines (by Mark Blumenthal,
published by Integrative Medicine Communications) is an English translation
of the German “safe herb” list (the Commission E report). For more informa-
tion on herbs, you can also check out Herbal Remedies For Dummies
(Christopher Hobbs, Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
Relieving Your Symptoms with Plants
Herbal treatments for the mental, emotional, and physical symptoms associ-
ated with perimenopause and menopause abound. (A lot of these herbal
treatments also relieve similar premenstrual-syndrome symptoms as well.)
Herbalists use a number of botanical therapies that are mild, effective, and
reliable. Some therapies have been tested in clinical trials; others have been
proven helpful during years of use. Still others have both up- and downsides
you might want to consider. We’ll give you more information about the most
commonly used of these (including their scientific names) in the section later
in this chapter, “Getting the scoop on individual herbs.”
Cataloging herbal therapies by symptom
If you’re wondering what herbal therapy can do for you, here are some of the
symptoms that perimenopausal and menopausal women look to herbs to
relieve, and the herbs that may be effective:
 Depression and anxiety: angelica Siberian ginseng ginkgo, licorice 
root, St. John’s Wort, motherwort, Asian ginseng, ashwaganda or 
Indian ginseng 
 Heart palpitations: black cohosh, hawthorn, motherwort 
 Heavy bleeding: yarrow, lady’s mantle, shepherd’s purse, bayberry or
wax myrtle 
228
Part III: Treating the Effects 

 Hot flashes and night sweats: black cohosh, motherwort, Asian ginseng,
common sage 
 Insomnia: Siberian ginseng licorice root, lavender, motherwort, passion
flower or maypop, kava or kava kava, scullcap, valerian, ashwaganda, or
Indian ginseng 
 Memory problems: bacon, Asian ginseng, ginkgo, and rosemary
 Vaginal dryness: black cohosh, marigold, licorice root, American 
ginseng, and red clover
We don’t claim to be herbalists, but we do know that women in Europe and
Asia have used some herbs for years to treat the symptoms of peri-
menopause and menopause. However, we give no advice as to dosage for a
couple of reasons:
1. The quantity of active ingredients varies from brand to brand.
2. You should always seek help from a physician or a qualified herbalist
before taking herbs.
Herbs are natural, but natural doesn’t mean that they’re always without side
effects. Lots of things — sunshine, poison ivy, fresh tomatoes, rattlesnake
venom — are natural, but not all of them are good for you.
Getting the scoop on individual herbs
Many of the herbs used to treat perimenopausal and menopausal symptoms
are phytoestrogens (phyto means plant, and you know what estrogen is).
Phytoestrogens are plant estrogens — natural sources of estrogen that act in
your body as weak estrogens and seem to produce estrogen effects in
menopausal women. In other words, they reduce perimenopausal and
menopausal symptoms.
If you take phytoestrogens without a progestin, you’re at a higher risk for
endometrial cancer. Phytoestrogens are natural, but they are still mild forms
of estrogen and cause your uterine lining to continue to thicken. If you use
these herbs, simply mention it to your doctor. He or she can monitor your
bleeding and perform tests or recommend therapy as needed. (For more
information on unopposed estrogen therapy, see Chapter 11.)
Always tell your doctor if you’re taking any of these herbs. Some of them
interfere with the effectiveness of other medicines. Mention them when your
doctor asks you, “What medicines are you taking?” This is especially impor-
tant if you’re being treated for cancer, clotting disorders, high blood pres-
sure, antidepressants, hormone therapy, diabetes, heart or liver disease, or if
you’re planning to have surgery soon.

Ashwagandha or winter cherry (Withania somnifera)
Much like ginseng, eleuthero, and licorice, ashwagandha is said to reduce
stress and depression and aid sleep with long-term use. The sedative effects
of ashwaganda may be heightened if you drink alcohol or take barbiturates. 
Black cohosh (Actaea racemosa, Cimicifuga racemosa)
Even though current studies yield mixed results on whether black cohosh is
effective at relieving menopausal symptoms, women have used it for hun-
dreds, maybe thousands, of years. (Early Native Americans used black
cohosh, and other folk medicines made use of it.) Today it’s one of the more
commonly used phytoestrogens in the battle against perimenopausal symp-
toms because it relieves hot flashes, vaginal atrophy, tension, elevated blood
pressure, restless sleep, and stress.
Again, black cohosh is a phytoestrogen, so talk to your doctor before using it if
you have breast cancer or if you plan on using it for more than three or four
months.
If you’re going to give black cohosh a try, you can find it sold under the brand
name Remifemin. Remifemin is the extract approved in Germany to treat
menopause, and it seems to have fewer side effects than other formulas. The
German recommendation is to use it for six months or less (to avoid thicken-
ing of your endometrium).
Dong Quai (Angelica sinensis)
Also known as tang gu. Be careful with this one. This herb has been used for
hundreds of years in traditional Chinese medicine to “strengthen the blood,”
but its possible side effects are numerous and significant enough to warrant a
thorough discussion with your doctor prior to use. Dong quai is the natural
form of Coumadin (generic name: warfarin), a “blood-thinner” drug doctors
often prescribe for women who have arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat)
because it dilates the blood vessels and decreases clotting to improve blood
flow to your heart. It also seems to eliminate hot flashes.
Possible drawbacks? Dong quai has been implicated in promoting the growth
of breast cancer cells, even in women not taking estrogen therapy. It also
interferes with blood clotting, so if you’re having surgery be sure to let your
doctor know beforehand that you’ve been using this herb. You should stop
using it two weeks before surgery. Also, don’t use dong quai if you’ve had
unexplained vaginal bleeding. Try to avoid aspirin and other drugs that serve
to thin your blood while using this herb.
Ginkgo (Gingko biloba)
Here’s one that’s been in the news quite a bit. This herb is said to improve
your memory and feeling of well-being, and one study of 200 women showed
that it increased sexual desire.
230
Part III: Treating the Effects 

Don’t use it with abandon. Ginkgo interferes with blood clotting so be sure to
let your doctor know that you’re using this herb. If you’re scheduled to
undergo an operation, quit taking ginko at least two weeks before surgery.
And don’t take it if you’re taking other blood thinners such as the drug
Coumadin (or the herb dong quai). It can also cause skin rashes, headaches,
nausea, and diarrhea.
Ginseng (Panax ginseng, Panax quinqafolium, Eleutherococcus 
senticosus)
People all over the world consume a variety of different types of ginseng to
increase vitality, improve memory, relieve anxiety, and kickstart low libido.
Historically, menopausal women have used ginseng to relieve depression,
fatigue, memory lapses, and low libido. It doesn’t seem to raise your estrogen
levels or cause your endometrium to thicken, as some of the phytoestrogens
tend to do.
Do not use ginseng if you’re taking medications for depressions, anxiety, dia-
betes, or blood thinners. It’s been known to cause mania when combined
with certain antidepressant medications. 
Kava or kava kava (Piper methysticum)
Herbalists use kava to reduce anxiety and chronic pain and to promote sleep
and relaxation. However, even herbalists recognize a need for further tests to
determine if this herb is potentially toxic to the liver.
There is a risk that kava may cause severe liver damage. Talk to your doctor
before taking it.
Motherwort (Leonorus cardiaca)
The Chinese have used motherwort for a long time. Western herbalists make
use of it to treat menopausal anxiety, insomnia, heart palpitations, and vagi-
nal atrophy.
Do not use motherwort if you’re being treated for a thyroid condition.
Peony (Paeonia lactiflora)
Peony helps dilate the blood vessels so that blood flows more smoothly
through your cardiovascular system. Some folks claim that it also improves
your mental focus and reduces mental lapses.
Peony has been associated with liver toxicity. Only use this herb under the
supervision of a physician.
Red clover (Trifolium pratense)
Menopausal women often find that this herb, historically used to treat skin
and breathing problems, relieves vaginal dryness and lowers their LDL (“bad”
231
Chapter 17: Taking an Alternate Route: Non-Hormone Therapies

cholesterol) levels while increasing their HDL (the good stuff) levels. Red
clover contains isoflavones (the chemicals that make phytoestrogens work
like estrogen), so it acts as a mild estrogen.
As with all phytoestrogens, don’t use red clover if you’re being treated for
migraines, liver or kidney problems, or cancer. 
Sage (Salvia officinalis)
Sage is said to relieve hot flashes, but the claim hasn’t been widely researched.
Saint John’s wort or goat weed (Hypericum perforatum)
The popularity of Saint John’s wort for treating depression has grown tremen-
dously in recent years, but people have used this herb since the Middle Ages.
During perimenopause and menopause, women use it to treat mild depres-
sion. Research on its effectiveness yields mixed results.
This herb can cause sensitivity to light, anxiety, gastrointestinal symptoms,
dizziness, and other symptoms. It also interferes with a variety of other med-
ications, so as with any herb; tell your doctor that you’re taking it.
Soy
Soy is a plant estrogen (phytoestrogen), so it has the same pluses and prob-
lems as other phytoestrogens. It’s reported to relieve hot flashes, interrupted
sleep, anxiety, and other perimenopausal symptoms. However, too much soy
has the same effect as unopposed estrogen (unfettered thickening of the uter-
ine lining).
Although many advertisements for soy products point to the health of
women in Japan and China as evidence that they work, women in these cul-
tures start eating soy early in life, and they eat mostly fermented-soy prod-
ucts, such as miso (soybean paste) and tempeh (a chicken-like soybean food),
rather than soy-protein drinks and milk. But studies have shown that soy can
clean up your blood by reducing your total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol (the
bad cholesterol), triglycerides, and blood pressure while raising your HDL
(the good cholesterol) levels. (Read more about soy in Chapter 18.)
Vitex or chasteberry (Vitex agnus castus)
Vitex, or chaste tree, acts like progesterone by helping to reduce peri-
menopausal stress and depression. (Some women have found that it does
just the opposite, but reports of vitex causing stress and depression are
rare.) Because it acts like progesterone, vitex may help stabilize the uterine
lining. 
Side effects associated with vitex are not severe, but may include spotting
between periods, headache, and hair loss.
232
Part III: Treating the Effects 

If any herbal therapy gives you heart palpitations or anxiety, stop using it
immediately.
Getting Touchy about Acupuncture
Acupuncture is a form of Chinese medicine in which an acupuncturist inserts
long, thin needles into specific points along critical energy pathways in your
body, to treat pain or disease. The acupuncturist is trained to identify and
insert needles into the points on your body corresponding to your symp-
toms. For the doubters out there, acupuncture has been around for thou-
sands of years and isn’t all that far out. Asian doctors have successfully
performed surgeries using acupuncture as the anesthesia.
Acupuncture stimulates your body’s ability to resist or overcome
menopausal symptoms by correcting energy imbalances. Acupuncture also
prompts your body to produce chemicals that minimize pain and discomfort.
Acupuncture is widely recognized as a legitimate form of complementary or
alternative medicine, and many insurance plans cover this type of therapy. If
you’re interested in trying this therapy, ask your doctor for a referral to a
qualified specialist. Most states regulate and license acupuncturists, so you
can get names of acupuncturists from your state department of health.
233
Chapter 17: Taking an Alternate Route: Non-Hormone Therapies
Avoiding problems with plants
As we state throughout this chapter, just
because herbs are natural doesn’t mean they’re
always safe. Many of them can cause
unwanted side effects (but, remember, so can
hormones). If you decide to use herbal thera-
pies to alleviate menopausal symptoms, be
especially wary of
 Exaggerated claims. If a product purports to
be able to completely cure your symptoms,
improve your sex life, prevent heart disease,
and give you sparkling kitchen floors, it’s
time to be skeptical.
 Any product containing ephedra (ma
huang). Banned in 2004 after being linked
with heart attacks and deaths, ephedra can
still be found in a number of herbal products. 
 Mixtures of different herbs. It’s hard enough
to tell what’s inside when you buy single
herbs.

Soothing Symptoms with 
Mind-Body Therapies
Stress can be great if it motivates you to do your best — as in a race. But, if
you’re continually harried and worried, stress can actually do damage to
your mind and body. It can lead to changes in your eating and sleeping pat-
terns, anxiety, depression, and irritability. (Sounds a bit like menopause,
huh?) Continued stress can also affect your immune system, making you
more susceptible to cancer, hypertension, heart problems, and headaches —
the medical concerns women worry about after menopause. Take a look at
some of these non-medical therapies that can help you relax and reduce the
stress in your life. 
Tuning in to biofeedback
Biofeedback, which relies on the interconnectedness of mind and body, has
been around in a high-tech form since the 1960s, but it uses some of the
mind-body lessons embraced by ancient martial arts. Biofeedback uses moni-
toring instruments to provide you with physiological information (feedback)
about things such as your breathing or your pain level. By watching the moni-
toring device, and through trial and error, you learn to adjust your thinking to
control your body in ways that folks used to think were involuntary. 
Some of the menopause-related conditions you can treat with biofeedback
are hypertension, migraine pain, insomnia, stress, and urinary incontinence. 
Getting your yoga groove on
Now here’s a great way to address a whole host of potential problems at
once. Yoga can help you improve both strength and flexibility (two things
that may begin to decline after you’ve been on this planet for about 35 years)
and relieve stress. Staying flexible and strengthening the muscles in your
torso contribute to better balance and reduce your risk of falling and break-
ing a bone. A regular yoga practice that combines exercise, stretching, medi-
tation, and mindful breathing also promotes oxygen flow, improves posture,
reduces stress (and may thus strengthen your immune system), and
improves your overall quality of life. 
234
Part III: Treating the Effects 

Slip Sliding Away with 
Topical Treatments
Many perimenopausal and menopausal women experience vaginal atrophy
(drying and thinning of the vagina). In addition to using herbal therapies, you
can treat this condition in several ways without using hormone therapy.
You can buy lubricants without a prescription in the grocery store that will
help relieve the day-to-day discomfort of vaginal dryness. Replens is one of
the more popular brands of lubricants and has been shown to be as effective
as vaginal estrogen cream in relieving vaginal dryness in tests. Replens
comes in a tube with an applicator, and works best if you use it once a week. 
If vaginal atrophy is causing painful intercourse, we have a prescription-free
solution for you. A number of lubricants are designed to help you get slip-
pery. In fact, you may find that sex is more fun when you “butter up” than it
was before. K-Y Jelly has been around for years. Hospitals and doctors’
offices use it for lubricating thermometers when taking temperatures rectally
and for many other purposes. It also works well as a lubricant before inter-
course. Astroglide is another terrific product that can make you more slip-
pery. You can rub all of these products on your vagina prior to intercourse.
Offering Options for Bone 
and Heart Health
Prolonged periods of low estrogen levels can promote bone deterioration and
cardiovascular conditions. The latter is of special concern, because new
research doesn’t give hormone therapy the credit it once did for offering pro-
tection against heart disease. Although many women may still choose to use
hormone therapy (HT) to prevent osteoporosis, other medications and thera-
pies that directly treat both of these issues are available. 
Battling bone loss with medication
If you entered midlife with a history of strong bones, you’re ahead of the
game. In any case, you can minimize your risk of osteoporosis by taking cal-
cium supplements and vitamin D — and it’s never too late to begin practicing
a form of weight-bearing exercise, a critical component of keeping your bones
healthy. If you are at high risk for osteoporosis, your doctor may also pre-
scribe medication to help you keep your bones strong.
235
Chapter 17: Taking an Alternate Route: Non-Hormone Therapies

Talking bisphosphonates
A group of drugs called bisphosphonates are among the most effective med-
ications for halting and reversing bone loss in menopausal women.
Remember the tearing-down and strengthening through rebuilding we talked
about in Chapter 5? These drugs work by slowing down the destruction
phase of this process. The following list (brand names followed by generic
names in parentheses) contains some examples of bisphosphonates. 
Actonel (risedronate), Fosamax (alendronate), Aredia (pamedronate), Boniva
(ibandronate sodium), and Zoneta (zoledronic acid) are among the most
commonly used bisphosphonates. Approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for use in the United States in 1995, for instance, Fosamax pre-
vents bone material from breaking down. Women who are taking hormone
therapy can use this drug to get even more protection from fractures. 
Evidence is growing that links bisphosphonate medications (such as
Fosamax) to an increased risk for osteonecrosis of the jawbone, a rare but
extremely dangerous disease in which bone in the jaw actually dies. As of this
writing there is no cure for this disease. Discuss your potential risk for this
side effect with your doctor. If you are already taking a bisphosphonate med-
ication, bring this up with your doctor well in advance of any invasive dental
procedures you may need, because dental extractions or surgery have been
implicated in triggering this side effect in susceptible individuals. 
Introducing calcitonin
Miacalcin (calcitonin) is a nasal spray that uses a different technique to slow
down bone loss than the bisphosphonates use. Calcitonin is actually a hor-
mone that occurs naturally in your body. It helps regulate your calcium levels
by slowing the rate of bone deterioration and promoting rebuilding. It also
relieves bone pain caused by osteoporosis. Calcitonin can be administered
either as an injection or a nasal spray, and is typically only prescribed for
women who have been in menopause for at least five years. 
Ranging in on Raloxifene
Raloxifene (Evista) fights osteoporosis by increasing bone mass and slowing
bone loss. A SERM (selective estrogen receptor modulator), one of Raloxifene’s
side effects is that it helps to prevent breast cancer. (Read more about
Raloxifene and other SERMs in Chapters 11 and 13.)
Controlling cardiovascular disease
Cardiovascular disease includes conditions that affect the blood, blood ves-
sels, or heart (otherwise known as the cardiovascular system). (For more
information on how this system works, see Chapter 6.) Because heart disease
is the top cause of death of women in the United States, it’s important to do
236
Part III: Treating the Effects 

what you can to control your risks for problems in this area. Reducing the
risks of cardiovascular disease was thought to be one of the biggest benefits
of HT, but the results of the Women’s Health Initiative study have called all
that into question. (See Chapter 12 for the lowdown on this issue.) 
Reducing your risk of heart attack with drugs
Half of all heart attacks occur in people with normal cholesterol levels, so a
healthy cholesterol profile doesn’t mean you’re out of the woods. Of course,
the other side of that story is that half of all heart attacks occur in people
with lousy cholesterol profiles. So try to maintain a healthy diet and exercise
program and take your cholesterol medication if your doctor recommends it.
Arteriosclerosis (clogged arteries) isn’t the only problem that triggers a heart
attack. Many other conditions can lead to a heart attack as well:
 Angina (blood vessel spasms)
 Arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat)
 Blood clots
 High blood pressure
To reduce your risk of heart attack, be sure to maintain a healthy diet, exer-
cise regularly, and take the medication your doctor prescribes to treat high
cholesterol and any of these cardiovascular conditions. There are more than
a dozen classes of medication used to control or prevent heart attacks, but
these are among the most commonly used:
 ACE inhibitors: ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors are used
both for the prevention and treatment of heart attacks. If used within 24
hours of the start of heart-attack symptoms, ACE inhibitors can keep
you from dying of the heart attack and prevent heart failure stemming
from the heart attack. 
 Aspirin: By keeping your platelets (special blood cells responsible for
clotting) from sticking together and forming blood clots, one or two
daily “baby” (81 mg) aspirin can lower your risk of heart attack. 
Even though aspirin is an over-the-counter medication, it can have dan-
gerous side effects. Read the warning label on the bottle and discuss
possible side effects with your doctor. Be sure to tell your doctor that
you’re taking aspirin regularly if you’re facing surgery.
 Blood thinners: Coumadin (warfarin) is another drug doctors use to pre-
vent blood from clotting. Coumadin, a prescription drug is more effec-
tive than aspirin in preventing blood clots, so you must use caution and
have your blood monitored regularly when taking it. 
237
Chapter 17: Taking an Alternate Route: Non-Hormone Therapies

 Thrombolytics: Thrombolytics can dissolve a clot and restore blood
flow to the heart. These drugs must be administered within six hours of
the heart attack (before heart tissue begins to die from lack of oxygen)
to be effective.
 Vasodilators: These drugs help blood vessels relax and dilate (widen) so
that your heart doesn’t have to work as hard to get oxygen-rich blood in.
Nitroglycerin is a common vasodilator given to women who suffer from
angina. Take these drugs as directed by your doctor.
Other classes of medications used to treat or prevent heart attack include
antiarrhythmia medications, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, diuret-
ics, and others. Each type works differently and will be prescribed according
to the nature of your risk or heart disease. Some focus on keeping your blood
pressure at a normal level, while others keep your blood lean and mean —
that is, they boost your good (HDL) cholesterol, lower the bad (LDL) choles-
terol, and keep both of these and your triglycerides in balance.
Living a hearty lifestyle
Clean living will put you on the right road to heart health, too. Cardiac spe-
cialists recommend taking these steps:
 Get your blood cholesterol levels checked every year (total cholesterol,
LDL, HDL, and triglycerides). For more information on blood cholesterol
tests see Chapter 5.
 Visit your doctor regularly to assess your risk of cardiovascular problems.
 Read the labels on your foods and choose foods that are low in satu-
rated fat and cholesterol.
 Eat at least five fruits and vegetables each day to reduce your risk of
heart disease (and cancer).
 Keep your weight in check (turn to Chapter 18 for more on weighty
issues).
 Exercise regularly (see Chapter 19 for recommendations).
 Don’t smoke and avoid second-hand smoke. 
A life full of anger, anxiety, depression, and isolation also increases your risk
of cardiovascular disease. If one or more of these emotional conditions rule
your life, it’s not healthy, especially for your cardiovascular system. Having a
network of friends or relatives who can offer you emotional support can
lower your risk of cardiovascular disease. Try meditation or physical activity
to reduce anger, depression, and anxiety. You may want to share your symp-
toms with a healthcare provider in order to begin treating them.

Lifestyle Issues 
for Menopause
and Beyond

In this part . . .
Your body is changing. That’s a fact. Your body is less
forgiving about things like the dish of ice cream you
just couldn’t resist. That’s a fact too. With all the changes
going on, now is a perfect time to subscribe (or renew
your subscription) to healthy habits like balancing your
diet, getting a bit of physical activity, and breaking those
bad-health habits. A few slight modifications in your daily
routine can ensure that your body is living up to its poten-
tial. In this part, we offer practical advice that makes get-
ting or staying fit before and after the change relatively
easy. (And dare we say fun?) We even talk about how life
after menopause can be the richest and most rewarding
part of your life so far.

Chapter 18
Eating for the Change
In This Chapter
 Eating well to prevent and manage health problems
 Healthy eating for the long run
 Understanding why a healthy weight is important now
You’ve probably noticed that your body is less forgiving these days. That
extra glass of wine hits you a little harder than it might have when you
were in your 20s, going to your head now and then disturbing your sleep
later. Today you may find it tougher to start exercising, and your muscles and
joints protest a little louder — and a little longer — than they did back then,
often leaving you sore and achy. And an injury can set you back twice as long
now as it did when you were a 20-something.
Menopause gets your attention, up front and personal, with less than subtle
physical reminders such as hot flashes, weight shifting to your middle, heart
palpitations, and the like. You can’t help but take notice that your body is
changing.
There’s another way of looking at menopause, though. Think of menopause
as a welcome wake-up call to help you make the most, not just of these
important years, but of the rest of your life. It’s an opportunity for taking
stock, and, if necessary, for making a few critical course corrections. Lower
estrogen levels may increase your risk of medical problems such as osteo-
porosis and cardiovascular disease, but a healthy diet and lifestyle can lower
your risk for many of these medical issues, give you more energy, and
improve your quality of life. It can also reduce some of the annoying symp-
toms of menopause, such as hot flashes.
Paying attention to your eating habits — not just what you eat, but how you
eat — is critical at this point in your life. Because your metabolism starts to
slow down, and because you may be inclined to decrease your physical activ-
ity as you reach middle age, gaining weight is easier and taking it off can be
harder than it used to be.

In this chapter, we don’t recommend any quick fixes. To stay healthy, you
have to develop healthy habits. Habits are built on small changes that you
can live with — without feeling as though you’re making tremendous sacri-
fices. If you adopt healthier eating habits, you can avoid dieting and feel
better. We don’t have a miracle program; we just give you some great ways to
eat healthier so you can get to a healthy weight, maintain it, and help reduce
your risk of many diseases that strike menopausal women.
Eating to Promote Good Health
“You are what you eat” may sound trite, but it’s true. Scientific evidence
demonstrates that the foods you ingest affect your health, but you probably
have real-life experiences that prove this point. During the major transforma-
tion that is menopause, you want maximum energy and protection from dis-
ease. A proper diet can help ensure success on both fronts.
How do you promote good health through your diet? By adopting or main-
taining healthy eating habits. Many studies link healthy eating habits to good
health. Healthy eating habits mean eating a balanced diet of foods that keeps
your body well nourished and able to fend off disease and environmental
toxins.
Studies show that people who eat at least five helpings of fruit and vegetables
each day cut their risk of stroke by nearly a third (and they also lessen their
risk of cancer and heart disease). Another study found that the single most
important factor in keeping the immune system healthy is a balanced diet.
Eating right helps your body fight off illness and protects your blood vessels,
your bones, and your heart and other organs from chronic disease. Dieticians
recommend that you eat five to ten servings of fruits and vegetables each
day. Why? The antioxidants, phytochemicals, and fiber in fruits and vegeta-
bles build immunities, lower your blood pressure, and reduce your risk of
heart disease, stroke, and many types of cancer.
Eating healthy is easier than you think. You don’t have to walk around with a
calorie-counting book. You don’t have to eliminate all your favorite foods.
You don’t have to eliminate snacks. And you don’t have to live solely on
grapefruit juice and tofu. All you have to do is eat the right proportion of car-
bohydrates, protein, and fats and consume the right number of calories per
day. The number of calories you need to maintain your current weight is
probably between 1,500 and 2,200 calories each day. Your doctor can help
you to figure out the right number for you, which will depend on your height,
weight, how active you are, and your body mass index (to figure out your
body mass index, or BMI, read the “Finding a healthy weight” sidebar, later in
this chapter).
242
Part IV: Lifestyle Issues for Menopause and Beyond 

Here’s a quick example of a simple fruit-and-veggie meal plan that provides
even more than five of these great foods in one day:
 Breakfast: Add a handful of raisins and some diced apple to your morn-
ing oatmeal, and drink a glass of fruit juice with it. 
 Mid-morning snack: Snack on an orange or a banana.
 Lunch: Prepare a small green salad or cup of fruit salad with your meal.
 Afternoon snack: Munch on some raw veggies with low-fat dip or
hummus.
 Dinner: Be sure to have a vegetable and a salad or two vegetables.
 Evening snack: Enjoy a stem of grapes or another glass of juice.
See how easy that is? Even the most die-hard veggie haters like something
from the vegetable group, and nearly everyone enjoys fruit, so turning your
diet in a healthier direction can be fun and enjoyable.
243
Chapter 18: Eating for the Change
Sneaking in the vegetables
We admit that some folks aren’t crazy about
vegetables, or find them bothersome to prepare.
If you’re one of them, try these easy and pain-
less tips for fitting more vegetables into your
diet: 
 Add chopped carrots, bell peppers, zuc-
chini, or yellow squash to meatloaf. These
veggies make tasty additions, and veg-
etable-phobic folks barely notice them.
 Add vegetables to your pasta. Sauté garlic,
onions, and chopped carrots or zucchini in
a pan sprayed with vegetable oil. When the
pasta is tender, dump it in with the sautéed
vegetables.
 Combine a variety of colorful vegetables
together. You can stir-fry (spray vegetable
oil on the pan instead of pouring it from the
bottle to lower the amount of oil you use),
roast (spray with vegetable oil and broil 
in the oven for 10 minutes), or grill the 
vegetables outside (forget the vegetable oil
altogether) and then arrange them in color-
ful layers to make them visually appealing.
 Cook vegetables ahead to use all week. If
you’re grilling or roasting anyway, toss
some sliced onions, zucchini, tomatoes, and
peppers with a little vegetable oil and cook
them alongside your other food. Stored in
zip-top bags, they’ll be ready in your fridge
to add to pasta or sandwiches, or to top
pizzas.
 Add chopped vegetables to rice. Peas,
corn, broccoli, tomatoes, and bell peppers
work well, but you can use any of your
favorite vegetables.
 Take advantage of convenience. Snag
some bags of pre-sliced or shredded veg-
etables from your grocer’s produce section,
or frozen vegetables from the arctic aisle,
and you’re halfway there.

Trendy diets come and go — and then come back again with a new name.
Forget about them. You don’t need to follow the advice of some late-night,
slick-talking, infomercial guru to eat healthy and achieve or maintain a
healthy weight. A well-balanced diet will keep you full, and proper portion
sizes along with exercise and planning will keep you at your preferred weight.
We list several great resources for eating healthier and losing weight or keep-
ing it off in Appendix B.
Getting the right mix of nutrients
People eat for a lot of reasons other than to satisfy hunger. In fact, sometimes
people eat even when they’re not hungry (we’re guilty and bet you are too,
sometimes). You may eat for emotional reasons: out of boredom, because
you’re tired, angry, lonely, sad, happy, anxious — you name the emotion and
we’ve all eaten in the throes of it. Sometimes certain environments trigger
eating — you nibble as you clear the table, talk on the phone, or watch TV.
If you want to stay healthy and stick to a healthy weight, you need to eat with
a purpose! Think of food like fuel. What do you need to keep your body fueled
during the day? (The “fuel” is your blood sugar, which gives you the energy to
build muscle, repair cells, and fight illness.) You need to feed your body the
right mixture of proteins, complex carbohydrates, and fats to keep your well-
tuned machine purring. Table 18-1 shows the breakdown for a healthy, bal-
anced diet.
Table 18-1
Balancing the Scales of a Healthy Diet
Nutrient
Percent of Daily Calories
Protein
10–20
Complex carbohydrates
50–70
Fats

Based on American Heart Association dietary guidelines.
Proteins, carbohydrates, and fats work as a team to keep your energy level
high and your body in good repair. Simple carbohydrates (such as sugar)
give you quick energy, but it only lasts a few minutes. Complex carbohy-
drates (such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables) fuel your body for one to
three hours. Proteins provide energy over the course of four or five hours,
and fats fuel your body for most of the day (five to six hours). Getting the
right combination of foods throughout the day will give you energy and keep
you from having sudden cravings or feeling tired, anxious, or sleepy.
244
Part IV: Lifestyle Issues for Menopause and Beyond 

Phytochemicals, plant nutrients that are still being researched, may protect
against heart disease and cancer and build your immune system. They’re
found in red grapefruit, tomato, watermelon, lemons, and limes.
At any given meal, you don’t want to include too much refined sugar (the
energy you get only lasts 15 to 20 minutes, and you quickly become tired and
hungry) or too much fat (provides lots of calories, but not enough short-term
energy). If you get the right combination of protein, complex carbohydrates,
and fats you’ll feel fully charged for three to five hours.
The best way to approach this nutritional trio is to eat some foods belonging
to each category during each meal, but if you can’t manage that, make sure
you achieve the proper proportion by the end of the day.
In addition to eating right, you need to drink plenty of fluids. Although you’ll
still hear lots of recommendations to drink eight glasses of water a day, most
researchers now say that listening to your body is a better guide. If you’re
thirsty, drink. If you’re exercising, drink a little extra water before, during, and
after your workout. If you’re increasing the fiber in your diet, you may want
to drink a couple more glasses of water each day to help the flushing process.
Coffee, tea, sugar-free hot chocolate, and sugar-free soft drinks help you keep
your fluids up without tacking on too many extra calories. Don’t forget that
caffeine has a diuretic effect — it can actually promote the passage of fluids
out of the body (more peeing!), and carbonated soft drinks, even the sugar-
free kind, inhibit calcium absorption and can also contribute to heartburn, so
limit your intake of these.
If you blow it one day, don’t stress out. If you find yourself regularly strug-
gling to eat the right amounts of the right foods, try sitting down and plan-
ning out your meals for a few days at a time. Paying attention to what you eat
helps you control your eating and weight.
Fine-tuning your carb intake (carbohydrate, not carburetor)
The bulk of your diet should consist of complex carbohydrates, which works
out well because fruits and vegetables — the food group you’re supposed to
eat five servings of each day — generally contain complex carbohydrates.
Simple carbohydrates
The quickest way to raise your blood sugar is to eat sugar (soft drinks, candy,
jam). It takes very little effort for your body to take sugar and put it into your
bloodstream.
These simple sugars give you a quick burst of energy, but your blood sugar
drops just as quickly after about 15 minutes. Even athletes find that the quick
rush of sugar doesn’t do much to enhance their performance, so avoid these.
245
Chapter 18: Eating for the Change

Complex carbohydrates
Think of complex carbohydrates as “plant foods” because they include fruits
and vegetables as well as whole grains. They are digested more slowly than
simple carbohydrates so they provide fuel over a longer period of time —
one to three hours.
Choose fresh fruits and vegetables over the canned or processed variety
because the fresh versions contain more nutrients and fiber and less sugar
and salt. Choose whole-grain products (flours, breads, cereals, and so on)
over refined or processed grains because a lot of the vitamins, minerals, and
fiber are in the outer layer (the hull) of the grain, which is removed during
processing. If you’re not a fan of dense and chewy whole wheat products, try
some of the “white wheat” products, which are lighter but still provide some
of the nutrients of whole wheat.
Fiber is a type of complex carbohydrate and is sometimes called roughage.
Fiber is simply plant material that doesn’t break down in the human digestive
system.
 Soluble fiber dissolves in water and is found in a variety of berries and
other fruits as well as oats, legumes, and potatoes. Because they pass
more slowly through your digestive system, you keep a full feeling
longer.
 Insoluble fibers are not digested, so they act like brooms sweeping
through your digestive system and ushering out those partially digested
remnants from yesterday’s meal. This type of fiber prevents constipation
and improves a number of digestive problems such as spastic colon and
hemorrhoids.
You should eat eight or nine servings of high fiber foods everyday. This isn’t
as tough as it seems if you eat your vegetables and fruits and choose whole
grain breads and cereals. If you ever have colon polyps, you’ll want to bump
up the amount of fiber in your diet.
Building with proteins
Proteins help build and repair cells, muscles, and tissues.
Meat, fish, and dairy products, as well as peas and beans, are foods high in
protein. Most of these foods, with the exception of peas and beans, also con-
tain high levels of fat and cholesterol. (Chapter 5 tells you about the dangers
of too much cholesterol.)
So how do you keep your body healthy while getting adequate amounts of
protein? By choosing lean cuts of meat over fatty cuts. Put fish or chicken on
your plate more often than red meat (fatty fish such as salmon or tuna pro-
vide a special nutrient called Omega-3 acids — we’ll talk more about these in
246
Part IV: Lifestyle Issues for Menopause and Beyond 

the next chapter). Place low-fat milk products in your grocery cart instead of
their whole-milk cousins, or try soy milk. And limit your daily calories from
protein to 10 to 20 percent of your total intake.
Most Americans eat a lot more protein than your body requires. You only
need four ounces of protein per day. (A four-ounce serving of meat is about
the size of a deck of cards.) A serving of fish or meat and a couple servings of
low-fat dairy products will give you enough protein for the day.
Energizing with fats
Fats supply fatty acids that your body can’t produce and help your body
absorb the (fat-soluble) vitamins A, D, E, and K.
Per gram, fats give you twice the energy of carbohydrates and proteins, but
they also contain twice the calories! High-fat foods are packed with calories
and help you gain weight more quickly and easily than other foods. Fats also
raise your cholesterol levels and increase your risk of cardiovascular disease,
cancer, and diabetes.
You need a certain amount of fat in your diet, but you don’t have to work to
include it. Most Americans get way more fat than they need, which helps
explain why the United States is an overweight nation.
Foods high in fats include both plant and animal foods. Here are just a few:
fried foods, salad dressings, meats (bacon, roast beef, lamb, pork, hot dogs,
and more), dairy products (cream cheese, butter, ice cream, cheese, milk,
and so on), pastries, nuts, and many other foods we love! (For more informa-
tion on the dangers of fats and cholesterol when it comes to your cardiovas-
cular system, please check out Chapter 5.)
The lowdown on the three basic types of fats:
 Saturated fats: Found in butter, whole milk, meat, peanut butter, and
pastries (among other things), saturated fats elevate your cholesterol
and triglyceride levels.
Avoid eating more than 10 to 20 milligrams of saturated fats a day (less if
you can). Trans-saturated fats (“trans fats”) also raise cholesterol levels.
You find these rascals in fried foods, bakery goods, and hard margarines.
(Look for margarines that have “No trans fats” printed on their labels.
Your heart will thank you.) Packaged foods must now include informa-
tion on their labels that tell you how much trans fat they contain.
 Polyunsaturated fats: These fats usually come from plants. Corn 
oil, safflower oil, and many soft margarines fall into this category.
Polyunsaturated fats lower your bad cholesterol (LDL), but they also
lower your good cholesterol (HDL). Limit yourself to one tablespoon of
polyunsaturated fats a day.
247
Chapter 18: Eating for the Change

 Monounsaturated fats: Although these fats are a bit more helpful than
the others, you still need to keep monounsaturated fats under control
(between 15 and 25 milligrams per day, which equals about 2 table-
spoons of oil). These fats lower your bad LDLs and keep your good HDLs
high. You can find monounsaturated fats in peanuts and peanut oil,
olives and olive oil, and avocados.
Opt for polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats over saturated fats and
trans fats. And take advantage of the low-fat options that line the aisles of
grocery stores. If you keep your consumption of fats down, you can cut your
risk of cancer.
Rethinking how you eat
To maintain a high level of energy and keep yourself charging ahead through-
out the day, you have to put the right type of fuel into your tanks and main-
tain a continuous flow of fuel to your body.
To maintain your energy level, build muscle, and burn calories, balance your
eating over the course of the day. Eat at regular intervals — approximately
every three to six hours. If you follow this timetable, snacks actually play a
key role in your daylong meal plan. They add the right types of food for bal-
ance and keep you from feeling deprived of food. This doesn’t mean to add to
the overall amount you’re consuming every day — just parcel out the meals a
little differently. 
When it is time to sit down for a full meal, try re-imagining the way you plan
your meals and prepare your plates. The American Heart Associations “New
American Plate” initiative helps you to make the transition from a mostly
meat-based meal to one that’s a little lower on the food chain. In this plan,
vegetable- and grain-based dishes take center stage while protein and fats
play supporting roles. You may already eat a number of meals this way —
think of a dinner of pasta with pesto and a little cheese, or a chef salad with
lots of veggies and a bit of cheese, ham, and egg, for instance.
Increasing numbers of Americans are identifying themselves as vegetarians,
vegans, or “flexitarians,” so it’s also easier than ever to find mostly plant-
based meals, even when you eat out. Ethnic restaurants are often wonderful
places to find this kind of eats — consider Greek salad (ask for the dressing
on the side), Buddha’s Delight at a Chinese restaurant, or vegetarian stews
and curries at an Indian restaurant. In our supersized culture, portion sizes in
restaurants are still likely to be way too big. As soon as your food arrives, ask
for a carryout container and put half or more of your order into it before you
even start eating. You won’t be tempted to overindulge, you’ll have great left-
overs for tomorrow, and — eventually — restaurants may get the idea.
248
Part IV: Lifestyle Issues for Menopause and Beyond 

Some people eat only once a day. Why? Some folks take up this bad habit in
an attempt to lose weight. Others claim that they don’t have time to eat
throughout the day. Whatever the reason, it’s a bad idea. If you only eat once
a day, you’re more likely to pig out when you do eat and get so stuffed that
you feel tired and groggy after the meal. Plus, a once-a-day feeding regimen
doesn’t give your body the nutrients it needs to burn calories and build
muscle and tissue throughout the day.
Eating to Prevent or Contain Problems
Feeding your body the right foods can help forestall some health problems
and diet can be part of a treatment regimen for certain conditions. This sec-
tion talks about the most helpful nutrients for health maintenance and 
prevention:
 Antioxidants: Ongoing research shows the importance of antioxidants in
slowing the aging process. Antioxidants eliminate free radicals from your
body. Free radicals are to your body what rust is to your car: They pro-
mote damage to your infrastructure, leading to heart disease, lower
immunity, cataracts, diabetes, and cancer. Antioxidants hook up with the
free radicals and escort them safely out of your body so they can do no
harm. Colorful fruits and vegetables (such as broccoli, berries, grapes,
and carrots) are especially high in antioxidants.
 Fiber: Fiber pushes food through your digestive system helping protect
your body against colon cancer, diverticulitis (inflammation of the little
pouches inside your colon), spastic colon, other digestive problems,
and hemorrhoids. It helps lower your cholesterol levels and stabilizes
blood-sugar levels. Fiber also gives you a full feeling and helps you con-
trol your weight.
Fiber is found in the skins of vegetables and fruits and the outer layers
of grains, so eating the skin of your baked potato and choosing whole
grains helps increase the amount of fiber in your diet.
 Phytoestrogens: Researchers are just beginning to discover the benefits
of phytoestrogens, which are sometimes called isoflavones. Soy proteins
and isoflavones are phytoestrogens (plant estrogens), which lower cho-
lesterol and support your immune system. They may protect against
breast cancer, heart disease, and osteoporosis. You can find soy in tofu,
tempeh, soymilk, and soy yogurt. Flaxseed is another powerful source of
phytoestrogens. These miniscule, teardrop-shaped seeds come in brown
or golden varieties and contain essential fatty acids, Flax is no Johnny-
come-lately seed — its benefits have been touted for centuries and are
promoted for their cholesterol-lowering capabilities. Research suggests
249
Chapter 18: Eating for the Change

they may also hold promise as a cancer-fighting food. Flaxseed must be
ground to be absorbed by the body and it has a short shelf life. Buy
them in small quantities and grind them in a spice mill or coffee grinder,
then sprinkle on oatmeal or mix into baked goods such as breads and
muffins. Flax oil may also be of benefit but should not be used for cook-
ing; heating destroys its beneficial properties.
A very small percentage of people are allergic to flaxseed. Start with only
1⁄2 teaspoonful a day, and call your doctor immediately if you experience
allergy symptoms such as a rash or shortness of breath.
A single serving of soy per day is beneficial. Some research indicates
that too much soy can negatively impact your hormone balance.
250
Part IV: Lifestyle Issues for Menopause and Beyond 
The joy of soy
Soy isn’t just hidden away at the health-food
store any more. These days it’s found in all kinds
of products at the grocery store: tofu is right
there on the shelf in the produce department,
and crisp green edamame — fresh, unfer-
mented soy beans — are making a splash as
chichi bar snacks. 
There’s a good reason why soy is popping up all
over. Researchers are increasingly convinced
that soy may offer significant benefits to peri-
menopausal women. Studies have linked it with
decreases in breast cancer, heart disease, and
osteoporosis. 
This beneficial bean contains special proteins
and isoflavones (plant estrogens) that lower
cholesterol and support your immune system.
Other researchers, however, are concerned
about whether the isoflavones in soy could
themselves promote the growth of estrogen-
sensitive cancers. Your age may make a differ-
ence, too. A Dutch study showed that soy’s
benefits were greater for women who added it
to their diets during the perimenopausal period.
Women who jumped on the soy bandwagon in
their 60s and 70s showed little improvement in
bone density. Here again, prevention is likely to
be far more effective than trying to improve your
health after it has begun to decline.
Most doctors agree that a single serving of soy
per day is beneficial. Here are some easy ways
to add it to your diet:
 Snack on edamame, or toss them into
salads. Shelled or still in the pod, these
bright green beauties can be found in the
frozen food aisle. Follow package directions
to cook them and salt lightly.
 In Asian restaurants, ask for tofu to be
added to your vegetable stir-fry or your pad
thai.
 Substitute soy milk (it even comes in choco-
late) for regular in your glass or over your
breakfast cereal. 
 Don’t care for tofu? Try tempeh, another fer-
mented soy product that comes in a variety
of flavors, baked or in stir fries.
 Stir a spoonful of miso into soups and salad
dressings. This salty paste adds a subtle
savory taste to foods, and keeps for a long
time in your refrigerator. 

Strengthening your bones
Osteoporosis (brittle bones) is particularly common in women after
menopause because long periods of lower estrogen levels promote bone loss.
To slow the rate of bone loss, it’s important that you have plenty of calcium
in your diet and an adequate supply of the vitamins that help your body
absorb calcium.
Diet and exercise are two of the best and easiest ways to improve the health
of your bones. In the following sections you’ll find some great information for
bone-healthy eating.
Feeding your calcium needs
You should ingest between 1,200 to 1,500 milligrams of calcium each day
(check out the table in Chapter 4 for your exact dosage). If you want to break
that down into an eating plan, you need to eat two cups of dairy products,
one cup of juice with added calcium, and two calcium-rich foods each day.
Many foods are naturally high in calcium, including dairy products (try to get
the low-fat type) and green, leafy vegetables such as kale and collard greens
(green vegetables that are high in oxalic acid, such as spinach, inhibit your
body’s absorption of calcium). Fish canned with its bones, such as canned
tuna or salmon, is also high in calcium. Many juices, breakfast products (such
as cereal and frozen waffles), and breads are “calcium-fortified,” making it
even easier to add calcium to your diet.
Many women, especially those who are lactose intolerant and have trouble
digesting dairy products, don’t get enough calcium through the foods they
eat and find it easier to take calcium supplements. If you’re one of these
people, take supplements (usually a pill or chewable tablet) throughout the
day rather than in one large dose. This way you’ll ensure maximum absorp-
tion of the calcium.
Calcium citrate and calcium carbonate are the recommended supplements
because they’re more easily absorbed than calcium phosphate, calcium lac-
tate, and calcium gluconate, and they’re free from contaminants. Avoid using
bone meal and dolomite as calcium supplements because they can be conta-
minated with lead.
Take calcium supplements with a glass of orange juice or tomato juice — the
vitamin C helps you absorb the calcium. Taking calcium supplements with
milk is also great because the lactose and vitamin D in milk also helps you
absorb calcium.
251
Chapter 18: Eating for the Change

Here are some great tips (if we do say so ourselves) to help you get more 
calcium into your diet:
 If you eat cereal for breakfast, try the brands that have 400 or 500 mil-
ligrams of calcium in each serving. Instant oatmeal is also a good source
of calcium but only contains about 100 milligrams of calcium in each
packet.
 Add low-fat grated cheese to baked potatoes, salads, toast, or your
favorite vegetables.
 Combine fat-free ricotta cheese with fat-free cream cheese and a squeeze
of honey for a great bagel spread. You get more calcium and a very satis-
fying treat.
 Add nonfat, dry, powdered milk to oatmeal, casseroles, pancakes,
yogurt, or smoothies to bone up on calcium.
 Citrus juices with added vitamin D and calcium are easy to work into
your daily routine and can give you much of the calcium you need 
each day.
 Some antacids, such as Tums, not only relieve indigestion, they also 
contain 500 milligrams of calcium. They’re worth a chew!
Absorbing some helper vitamins
You need 400 IU (international units) of vitamin D each day to help your body
absorb calcium. That recommendation increases to 600 to 700 IU after your
70th birthday. But don’t ever exceed 800 IU of vitamin D a day, because vita-
min D is a fat-soluble vitamin and can be toxic if you get too much. Most milk
products and cereals are fortified with vitamin D so it’s not difficult to meet
your daily requirements through a good breakfast.
You can get all the vitamin D you need by getting 10 to 15 minutes of sun-
shine each day. Sunshine stimulates your skin to produce vitamin D. (Take a
walk and kill two birds with one stone! You can get your vitamin D and some
exercise.) Don’t forget to protect your skin, though, by avoiding the midday
sun. Take your sunshine early or late in the day.
Vitamin K is also good for your bones and is found in green vegetables such
as lettuce, broccoli, cabbage, and spinach.
If you take medications to thin your blood or to prevent blood clots, talk 
with your doctor before consuming large amounts of green vegetables, as 
vitamin K can interfere with the effectiveness of these medicines. 
Potassium and magnesium are also critical in your quest to maintain bone
strength. You can get these nutrients by including greens (as in collard
greens, mustard greens and so forth), beans, whole grains, vegetables, and
fruits in your meals every day.
252
Part IV: Lifestyle Issues for Menopause and Beyond 

Pumping up your cardiovascular system
Keeping your cardiovascular system healthy is a matter of keeping your
blood lean and your vessels clean. Lean blood (low in LDL cholesterol —
“bad cholesterol” — and triglycerides) prevents the fatty deposits that can
lead to all sorts of cardiovascular problems from forming in your arteries.
Curbing the fats in your diet and replacing them with fruits, whole grains, and
vegetables can help maintain healthy blood, arteries, and heart. The antioxi-
dants, fiber, and other beneficial nutrients found in these plant foods help
prevent cholesterol from oxidizing and damaging your arteries and heart.
Fruits and vegetables deliver more fiber and complex carbohydrates and less
fat than any other food group, which is critical to maintaining lean and clean
blood. Also, the calcium, antioxidants, and other vitamins found in fruits and
vegetables keep your blood, blood vessels, and heart healthy. Plus fruits and
vegetables are 90 percent water (low in calories) and very filling.
Watch those high-cholesterol foods such as egg yolks, sausage, bacon, ice
cream, butter, cheese, pastries, fried foods, and fatty cuts of meat. Not sur-
prisingly, these foods can raise the cholesterol levels in your blood.
253
Chapter 18: Eating for the Change
Alcohol and menopause
Recently there’s been lots of mixed press about
the health effects of alcohol. Some reports indi-
cate that drinking in moderation may actually
have benefits for heart health, could raise good
cholesterol, and inhibit the formation of blood
clots. A cocktail or a glass of wine, however,
can trigger and intensify your menopausal
symptoms. Alcohol temporarily increases the
level of estrogen in your bloodstream, making
hot flashes more likely. A drink can also further
interfere with your ability to remain asleep at
night. There may be even more serious conse-
quences of drinking alcohol if you’re taking hor-
mone replacement therapy. Findings from the
Nurse’s Health Study indicate that for those on
HRT, consuming even one and a half drinks a
day makes your risk of breast cancer 30 percent
higher than it is for women who don’t drink alco-
hol at all. Here are some tips:
 If you don’t drink, this is not a great time to
start.
 If you do drink, moderation’s the watch-
word. Limit your intake to no more than one
drink a day.
 Consider substituting a healthier beverage
for booze at least some of the time. Seltzer
or club soda, tomato or fruit juice, iced tea,
or smoothies are thirst-quenching and can
be just as festive — good for your spirits as
well as your body.

Watch your sodium if you’re concerned about high blood pressure (and one
out of five Americans should be concerned). Avoiding processed foods,
smoked meats and fish, salty snack foods, canned vegetables, olives, pickles,
and fast food can greatly reduce the sodium in your diet. Choose fresh veg-
etables and meats and low-sodium alternatives.
Weighing in on the Weight Issue
You know, we know, everybody knows that being overweight is unhealthy.
But did you know that some variations on excess weight are more dangerous
than others? Lower estrogen levels at this time not only make gaining weight
more likely, but they also trigger redistribution of fat. That curvy pear shape
turns into more of an apple shape as fat migrates to your middle. Carrying
excess belly fat around in your menopausal years entails greater health risks
than fat distributed more evenly around your frame.
The good news is that menopause can provide the perfect opportunity to
assess yourself and your goals near the midpoint of your life, and get you
started down the road to a new, healthier you. 
How much weight is too much?
Two-thirds of Americans are overweight. Whether you count yourself among
them or not, weight is likely to have been of at least middling (no pun
intended) concern to you at some point in your life. Here are just some of the
reasons why weight has an incredibly important effect on health. 
 Overweight women are more likely to suffer heart disease, stroke, dis-
eases of the blood vessels, and certain types of cancer, including breast
and colon. 
 Overweight women are also more likely to die at a younger age than the
average woman. 
 Maintaining a healthy weight is kinder to joints and muscles and makes
exercising regularly easier and more fun. 
 Extra weight increases your risk of high cholesterol and arteriosclerosis
(hardening of the arteries), 
 Overweight women are more likely to die at a younger age than women
of normal weight.
254
Part IV: Lifestyle Issues for Menopause and Beyond 

A healthy weight is one that is associated with people who have few health
problems. You can find your recommended weight by referring to weight
tables published by insurance companies. Insurance companies try to figure
out the weight ranges for women who live the longest. This is one of the sim-
plest ways to determine a healthy weight. 
One of the best ways to help your overall quality of life during and after the
change is to maintain a healthy weight.
Body fat (measured by your Body Mass Index — BMI — explained in the
“Finding a healthy weight” sidebar) is an even better predictor of your poten-
tial for health problems than weight. Studies show that the higher your BMI,
the greater your risk of hypertension (high blood pressure). Menopausal
women are already more susceptible to hypertension and other cardiovascu-
lar diseases (see Chapter 5). The risk of hypertension begins to increase
when your BMI gets above 20 and rises steadily as your BMI increases. It’s
thought that extra weight makes blood vessels constrict. Even a modest
weight gain (5 to 10 pounds) after menopause raises your risk of hypertension
(high blood pressure). The Nurses’ Health Study found that women who lost
10 to 20 pounds during the course of the study had a lower risk of hyperten-
sion than women who maintained a steady weight.
255
Chapter 18: Eating for the Change
Menopause and diabetes
Adult-onset diabetes can lead to a slew of other
medical conditions, such as hypertension, cir-
culation problems, skin ulcers, nerve disorders,
stroke, blindness, heart disease, and kidney
problems. If you’ve gained more than 12 pounds
since you were 18, you’ve increased your risk of
adult-onset diabetes; if you’ve gained more than
40 pounds, your risk of diabetes has gone 
way up, and you don’t want that. Women who
lose weight can reduce their risk of diabetes
dramatically.
If you already have diabetes, the onset of peri-
menopausal symptoms may throw off all your
carefully laid plans to maintain your blood sugar
at a healthy level. Even worse, because varia-
tion in both blood sugar level and estrogen level
can lead to similar symptoms — such as hot
flashes and fatigue — you may not know which
one to blame. The combination of diabetes and
dropping estrogen levels can exacerbate sexual
symptoms such as vaginal dryness and yeast
infections, too.
More than ever, you need to monitor your blood
sugar carefully, follow a healthy diet, and 
work with your healthcare provider to keep 
your treatment regimen working for you. The
dosages of any medications you are on will
probably have to be fine-tuned, and your doctor
may recommend a statin or other cholesterol-
lowering medication. These drugs are highly
effective at reducing bad (LDL) cholesterol
levels. This in turn can combat the increased
risk of heart disease posed by menopause.

Because of estrogen’s role in maintaining healthy blood and vessels, women’s
risk of cardiovascular problems rise after menopause as estrogen levels fall.
In addition, your risk of cardiovascular disease increases even more as your
BMI increases.
If you’ve gained more than 12 pounds since you were 18, you’ve increased
your risk of adult-onset diabetes; if you’ve gained more than 40 pounds, your
risk of diabetes has gone way up, and you don’t want that. Women who lose
weight can reduce their risk of diabetes dramatically.
Eating to control body weight
Many of us struggle with controlling our weight, and it’s no wonder. If you’re
like us, you grew up with a parent or grandparent telling you to “clean your
plate if you want dessert” and with advertisements claiming that “nothin’
says lovin’ like somethin’ from the oven!” But we’re here to tell you that the
struggle to control your weight is a worthwhile battle. Achieving or maintain-
ing a healthy weight has a tremendous impact on your overall health.
You don’t have to quit eating your favorite foods; just watch the size of your
portions. Awareness is the first step.
256
Part IV: Lifestyle Issues for Menopause and Beyond 
Finding a healthy weight
Your very own, personal healthy weight can be
fine tuned by evaluating your body fat. Body fat
is the real villain in this story, not weight. To
measure body fat, visit your physician or health
club. Your doc (or a helpful individual at your
local club) will use calipers to measure the
amount of fat in several places on your body, or
if she wants to be really accurate, she’ll
immerse you in a tub of water to see how much
water you displace. A good, general rule of
thumb is that healthy women have between 18
and 27 percent body fat.
Another measurement, your Body Mass Index
(BMI), is based on height and weight, provides
a good estimation of body fat, and is easier to
calculate. To determine your BMI:
1. Multiply your height (in inches) by itself.
2. Divide your weight (in pounds) by the
number you got in step 1.
3. Multiply your answer in step 2 by 705.
This is your BMI. If your score is less than 
25, you’re in the healthy range. Women with a
BMI higher than 30 (or if you’re using a weight
table — 20 percent more than your recom-
mended weight) are considered obese.

Counting calories
To lose weight, you have to reduce the calories you eat and/or burn more
calories through exercise. To maintain a healthy weight when you reach that
point, you have to strike a balance between the calories you eat and the calo-
ries you burn through activity. But remember: you must get the proper nutri-
ents to keep your body healthy and protect it from disease throughout the
process. That’s the secret to success.
Let’s face it, nobody likes to count calories. If you’re at a healthy weight and
simply want to eat a healthier diet, try eating lower on the food chain (more
fruits, veggies and grains, and fewer animal-based products), and making
desserts and high-fat snacks an occasional treat, not a part of your everyday
diet. You’ll have more energy, suffer fewer food cravings, and help your body
ward off disease and chronic medical conditions.
If your goal is to eat healthy to shed pounds, you need to become aware of
the calories you’re eating and the source of those calories. Keep your calo-
ries within a healthy range, add a bit of exercise five days a week, and you
can shed pounds while you improve your health.
Most people can eliminate lots of empty calories — the calories you eat with-
out a purpose just because they’re there. Do you ever finish up the French
fries on your child’s plate? Do you snack on leftovers as you clear the table? If
so, you’re falling into the empty-calorie trap.
Here are the calorie recommendations for women:
 To maintain your weight: 1,500 to 1,600 calories a day
 To lose weight: 1,300 to 1,400 calories a day
If you’re extremely active (exercising for more than an hour each day), add
100 calories to the recommendations.
Exercise burns up calories, so you can lose weight more easily and keep it off
by incorporating exercise into your fitness plan. For some tips on fitting fit-
ness into your daily life, check out Chapter 19.
If you’re trying to watch your calories, watch the alcohol. Limit your alcohol
intake to no more than three drinks (11⁄2 ounces of liquor, a 4-ounce glass of
wine, or 12 ounces of beer) a week. Wine and beer have about 100 to 150 calo-
ries. The alcohol in a mixed drink is 100 calories or so, and if you mix it with
something sweet, you can consume up to 400 calories per drink.
257

Nibbling on little nothings
The following list provides some good nutritional tips that have little or no
caloric cost:
 Lettuce, parsley, radishes, watercress, and celery provide nutrients with-
out the calories.
 Use butter-flavored sprays when cooking instead of oil to shave off fat
and calories.
 Sugar-free gelatin adds a bit of free dessert to any meal.
 Hot pepper and picante sauces add a bit of spice without a lot of 
calories.
 Low-fat bouillon is a great substitute for butter-based sauces when serv-
ing pasta or steamed vegetables.
 Fat-free cream cheese, mayonnaise, salad dressing, and sour cream are
free in terms of fat calories as long as you use only 1 tablespoon.

Discouraging diets
It seems as if someone is always pushing a new
diet that promises to make weight disappear
using a secret no one else has discovered.
Many of us try one of these “miracle” diets and
end up looking for a new one because the
weight we lose reappears. The secret to getting
to a healthy weight and staying there is to —
are you ready for this? — avoid diets. Most
diets have you chomping at the bit, waiting for
the pounds to come off so you can go back to
eating the foods you want. When you go back
to your old habits, the weight returns.
Eating healthier can help you lose weight and
keep it off because it encourages you to change
the way you think about food. You begin to think
about food as a fuel, as opposed to a treat that
you can’t have or a substance that you must eat
despite its cardboard-like flavor. You begin to
think about what your body needs to stay lean,
build muscle, rejuvenate tissue, and ward off
disease.
Beware of unbalanced diets that tell you to
completely avoid one of the major nutrients
(complex carbohydrates, fats, or protein). By
cutting out one of these groups, you may also
eliminate fiber, antioxidants, or phytochemicals
that protect your body from aging and disease.
Low-carbohydrate and high-protein diets are
high in cholesterol and low in fiber, which may
increase your risk of heart disease, cancer, and
digestive problems.
Liquid diets offer quick weight loss, but you
mostly lose muscle. When you lose more
muscle than fat, you actually have a higher per-
cent of body fat even though you weigh less.
Also, some liquid diets can damage your heart,
kidney, and liver and cause an irregular heart-
beat and many other health problems.

Foregoing fat
It’s really tough. Many of our favorite foods are high in fat. Take away the fat,
and they don’t seem so good. Believe it or not, we have some tips for eating
satisfying meals that are a bit less fatty. If you really dislike the low-fat alterna-
tives, go ahead and have the high-fat food, just reduce the portion size, and
have it less often. Only eat half of that bratwurst or eat a donut hole instead
of the whole donut. Here are some other great tips:
 Try mixing instant bouillon in hot water and adding a few tablespoons to
vegetables, rice, or pasta instead of putting butter or margarine on the
food. You get that rich taste without the fat.
 Similarly, a tiny drizzle of olive oil — one of the “good” fats — provides
great flavor without a lot of unhealthy calories.
 Choose lean cuts of beef (tenderloin instead of rib-eye, for example) —
they have less marbling than the fattier cuts.
 Try putting low-fat yogurt or low-fat cottage cheese on top of your baked
potato instead of butter or sour cream. Salsa’s great on baked potatoes,
too, and adds no fat at all.
 When you order a salad at a restaurant, get the salad dressing on the
side. And, if the restaurant doesn’t have a low-fat alternative, try using
one tablespoon of a vinaigrette — or even a spoonful of a balsamic vine-
gar, which has such a rich flavor you probably won’t even miss the oil.
 Eat spicy toppings such as salsa, ginger, or picante sauce instead of
cream sauces.

 Developing new exercise routines
W
ith all the changes going on with your body, now is a great time to
make sure that you’re physically fit. Physical activity and exercise
during perimenopause and menopause can relieve many of the common
physical and mental/emotional symptoms that accompany the change.
We have some good news: You don’t need to be an athlete or join a health
club to realize tremendous health benefits from exercise. According to sev-
eral studies, one hour of moderate exercise five times a week improves the
quality and duration of your life. In this chapter, we introduce you to exer-
cises that you can do in your home, and show you ways to fit fitness into
your busy life.
Maybe you’re already physically active, and you want to move your program
up a notch. If so, pat yourself on the back. Studies indicate that only 20 per-
cent of American women get 30 minutes of exercise five times a week. Even if
you’ve got a head start on the rest of us, though, we’ll offer tips everyone can
use to reduce health risks and help control menopausal symptoms. 
Recognizing the Benefits of Exercise
The lower estrogen levels in your body during the change can contribute to a
number of medical conditions, memory lapses, and emotional transforma-
tions. Physical activity can help you reclaim your grip on life and fight off car-
diovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, osteoporosis, and more.

The type of physical activity we’re talking about consists of movement that
burns calories. Jogging or playing tennis burns lots of calories quickly, but
seemingly mundane activities such as vacuuming, gardening, and raking
leaves can be beneficial if you do them for a long enough period of time (45
minutes to an hour). The trade-off is simple: Do a vigorous activity for a short
period of time or a moderately demanding activity for a longer period of time.
Many terrific studies show that physical activity makes a difference in the
health of menopausal women. Exercise puts a positive spin on many of the
health concerns women face during and after the change.
Tweaking your attitude
A variety of studies show that exercise and physical activity improve your
ability to cope with stress and depression. One study even shows that run-
ning is more effective than psychotherapy for reducing depression, and the
results aren’t that difficult to believe. The term runner’s high isn’t a joke —
physical activity helps your body release endorphins, substances that natu-
rally relieve pain and elevate your mood.
You can relieve the perimenopausal symptoms of anxiety, irritability, mood
swings, decreased libido, and depression by sticking to a fitness plan that
gives you time to build your mental and physical fitness.
Setting aside some time for exercise each day also helps you organize your
thoughts and feelings, relieve stress and anxiety, and re-establish your grip
on life. If you make the initial effort, you’ll begin to look forward to your time.
Flashing less — sleeping more
Only about 1 in 20 women who exercise experience hot flashes. Compare that
stat to the ratio of women in the non-exercising crowd who experience hot
flashes — about 1 in 4 — and you can quickly see why tying on those sneak-
ers and going for a walk is a good thing. Hot flashes are a pain in their own
right, but they can also turn into night sweats and cost you precious dream
time. Exercise can lessen this effect and make your sleep more restful.
Exercise also helps women sleep better at night for another reason. Yes, exer-
cise makes you tired, but there’s more to the story. Exercise affects the
amount of melatonin (a hormone that helps regulate sleep) in your body.
Melatonin levels are normally high in young children, but they appear to
decline gradually with age in some adults. Exercise keeps the pineal gland
producing melatonin at night (when levels are naturally higher), even though
melatonin levels actually decline when you exercise.

Shedding pounds
Women typically gain about one pound a year from their late 30s through
their mid-60s. A pound may not sound like much, but it adds up over the
years. Weight gain raises your risk of many diseases. Women who incorporate
30 to 60 minutes of physical activity into their lives every day can maintain
their present weight or lose weight (but exercising an hour each day is the
prescription for overall health, not just weight loss).
You can find all kinds of ways to lose weight, but to lose weight and keep it
off, walking is one of the most effective physical activities. After studying
thousands of dieters, one study found that 49 out of 50 people who lost 30
pounds or more walked for at least half an hour at a brisk pace every day.
The bonus: you don’t need any equipment or special conditions other than
comfortable shoes and personal motivation.
Keeping your heart healthy
Just because a woman generally has the heart of a man 10 years her junior
because of the estrogen her body produces, doesn’t mean that heart disease
doesn’t catch up with the female of the species. Keeping your heart healthy
through diet, exercise, and medication, if necessary, should be a priority for
your menopausal years.
Cleaning up with good cholesterol levels
Physically active women tend to have higher levels of the good cholesterol
(HDL) than women who aren’t so active. If you start exercising today, you can
notice higher HDL-cholesterol and lower LDL (bad) cholesterol levels within
a few months.
Listening to a beating heart
Because physical activity improves your cholesterol profile, your blood ves-
sels are less apt to play host to fatty buildup that results in arteriosclerosis.
Arteriosclerosis can cause hypertension (high blood pressure), heart dis-
ease, and stroke, so getting physical reduces your risk of all three.
The Nurses’ Health Study revealed that walking briskly for three hours a
week can reduce your risk of heart disease by 40 to 50 percent. The study
also showed that even women who just started walking regularly benefited
by reducing their risk of heart disease.
The more often you exercise and the longer your workout, the more benefits
you gain.
263
Chapter 19: Focusing on Fitness

Keeping a lid on blood pressure
Because exercise improves your cholesterol profile, your risk of high blood
pressure goes down too. With a healthier cholesterol profile, your blood ves-
sels are less likely to get clogged with plaque (deposits of fat mixed with
other substances that are covered with a layer of calcium and found on the
walls of your blood vessels). Arteriosclerosis causes your blood vessels to
narrow and forces your heart to beat harder to get the blood through, raising
the pressure in your blood vessels and resulting in hypertension (high blood
pressure).
Exercising sound judgment
In case you haven’t guessed by now, regular exercise seems to cure whatever
ails you. This statement is especially true in relation to cardiovascular dis-
ease. Moderate exercise, such as walking for 30 minutes five times a week,
can improve the health of your body and mind.
Exercise benefits your cardiovascular system in many ways:
 Improves your circulation
 Increases your good (HDL) cholesterol levels
 Reduces total cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood pressure
 Increases your endurance
 Reduces anxiety, depression, and emotional stress
 Increases your metabolism so that you burn more calories, even at rest
 Builds another support group when you do it with friends
Shoring up your bones
After menopause, women begin losing bone density. They risk developing
osteoporosis (brittle bones; check out Chapter 5 for more info) as a result of
the loss. People who have osteoporosis are prone to fractures. This tendency
forces them to restrict their daily activity, which in turn impacts the quality
and longevity of their life. To prevent osteoporosis and fractures, take our
advice:
 Include weight-bearing exercises in your exercise routines to increase
bone density (bone strength) and to slow or prevent bone loss. (See
“Strengthening bones and toning muscle” later in this chapter.)
 Improve your balance and flexibility with stretching and core-training
exercises that can help you reduce your risk of falling and fracturing
your bones. (Jump to the “Flexing through stretching” section later on
for more information.)
264
Part IV: Lifestyle Issues for Menopause and Beyond 

Doing without diabetes
Diabetes is a serious health condition that can produce a host of other med-
ical problems ranging from hypertension to blindness. Exercise can reduce
your risk of adult-onset diabetes by helping you keep your weight in a safe
range and by improving your body’s response to insulin. (For more on dia-
betes, see Chapter 15.)
Even if you’re overweight or leading a sedentary lifestyle now, you can
reduce your risk of developing diabetes by beginning a fitness program. A
small increase in activity will help, but more activity provides more protec-
tion against diabetes. In one study, women who walked briskly for three
hours a week reduced their risk of diabetes as much as women who worked
out vigorously for half that amount of time. Our point? You don’t need to
train for a marathon to reduce your risk of diabetes.
Steering clear of colon cancer
In Chapter 14 we discuss the benefits of getting your colon checked regularly.
Exercise is another way to protect yourself against colon cancer. Exercise
keeps waste (and any carcinogens you may have ingested) moving through
your digestive tract and out of your body so the waste doesn’t linger in your
colon. The level of activity we recommend earlier in this chapter (an hour a
day five days a week) offers some protection against colon cancer.
Sharpening your memory
Staying active as you age has been proven to have a very positive impact on
memory and judgment. Getting more blood and oxygen flowing to your brain
seems to trigger these positive effects.
Living long and prospering
Without cracking open a fortune cookie, we can say with some confidence
that daily exercise can extend your life. One group of 60- to 80-year-olds cut
their death rate in half by walking two miles every day. Not too shabby.
265
Chapter 19: Focusing on Fitness

Focusing on Fitness Fundamentals 
Whatever activities you decide to do to improve your physical fitness, make
sure that you enjoy them. If you don’t like an activity, you won’t work it into
your daily schedule, and you won’t do it for long.
Plan your week out in advance to make sure that you reserve time for your
workout. Make your fitness time a priority that you won’t give it up whenever
things get busy. Planning your exercise in the morning, before other responsi-
bilities throw you off-course, is helpful. People who make exercise a life-long
habit are more likely to exercise in the morning. And exercise in the a.m.
increases your metabolism and keeps it elevated until you go to sleep —
many more hours of increased metabolism. 
Whenever you exercise, working physical activity into your day helps you
accomplish your primary long-term goal — living a long and healthy life —
and it makes you feel pretty good in the short term, too.
Getting started
If you haven’t been getting much exercise, begin your program slowly. For the
first few weeks, exercise three times a week for about 20 or 30 minutes per
session. Then, when you feel good with that pace and decide you want to
bump it up a notch, add a few more days and a little more time to your work-
out. Another way to move to the next level is to increase the intensity of your
workout. If you’re walking, go further or faster or walk twice a day on certain
days of the week. Or you may want to start jogging instead of walking. The
bottom line: You gain more by exercising longer or faster.
Regardless of how you decide to increase the intensity of your workout, make
sure that your body gets used to each level before you move on to the next. If
you start experiencing any abnormal symptoms (such as chest pain, short-
ness of breath, and so on) as you increase your exercise intensity, please con-
tact your doctor immediately.
Health clubs or the local YMCA are nice because they offer motivation and
instruction as well as an opportunity to form a support group with people
who are also trying to stay healthy. But you don’t have to join a club to
receive these kinds of benefits. Asking a friend from your neighborhood to
join in your morning walk or play a set of tennis can also provide the support
and motivation you need to stick with it.
If you have any health problems, visit your doctor for a thorough physical
before starting a new or more vigorous exercise program.
266
Part IV: Lifestyle Issues for Menopause and Beyond 

Fitting in fitness
Does anyone have a spare hour (or half-hour) in her day? When someone
raises the subject of exercise, you may think, “When do I have time to take a
walk or work out?” We know that demanding days leave you with little discre-
tionary time or energy.
But your family and your friends would agree that nothing is more important
than your health. Besides, you’re going to take time out of your life and away
from your family and friends for your health whether you exercise or not. So,
either take the time to exercise now or spend some time with the medical
professionals taking care of your health later.
Planning your program
After the onset of perimenopause, you want to keep your hormones balanced,
your diet balanced, and yes, your fitness program balanced. You should incor-
porate three types of activities into your fitness routine: aerobic exercise, flex-
ibility training, and strength training. Don’t worry — you don’t have to do all
three each day, but you should fit all three into your weekly fitness plan.
 Aerobic activity: Aerobic activity strengthens your cardiovascular
system, helps your endurance, and also helps you burn fat. Basically, it’s
the perfect type of exercise for women of all ages. Whether you perform
your aerobic activities in vigorous, relatively short bursts or at a slightly
slower pace for longer periods of time, the benefits work out the same.
For example, you can burn 200 calories by walking for 30 minutes or by
jogging for 18 minutes.
267
Chapter 19: Focusing on Fitness
Pumping your blood on busy days
Here are five simple ways you can incorporate
physical activity into an already busy day.
1. Take the stairs instead of the elevator.
Whether you go up or down, you get your
blood pumping and your legs working.
2. Walk the dog. Studies show that people
who walked their dog five days a week for
20 minutes a day lost an average of 14
pounds in less than a year (and it’s good for
Fido’s health, too).
3. When you go shopping, park your car away
from the store and walk briskly to your des-
tination. When you’re in a mall, take a lap 
or two. 
4. On your break time at work, climb the stairs
or take a walk. Some days, this may be 
the only time you have to get moving.
Remember: Every little bit helps. 

Aerobic exercise benefits your body because it forces your cardiovascu-
lar system and muscles to exert themselves. Too little exertion, and you
don’t gain all the benefits of exercise; too much exertion, and you stress
your cardiovascular system (and your muscles).
More vigorous forms of aerobic exercise include jogging, walking,
cycling, aerobic dance, martial arts, and jumping rope. Even activities
you probably don’t think of as exercise can give you a light aerobic
workout — walking your dog, golfing, shopping, gardening, or playing
with the kids.
 Flexibility training: This aspect of your workout routine can protect 
you from injury, improve your balance, and provide muscle flexibility.
Stretching is the simplest and easiest way to improve your flexibility 
and agility. Working with a fitness ball can improve your flexibility and
balance while strengthening and toning your muscles. Yoga is probably
the oldest form of stretching.
 Strength training: Incorporating strength training into your exercise
schedule helps you build muscle tone, endurance, and bone density.
Because strength training builds muscle, it speeds up your metabolism
so you burn more calories — even when you’re resting. (Muscle burns
more calories than fat does, so the more muscle you have, the more
calories you burn.) Weight training and Pilates both improve muscle
strength.
Scheduling fitness fun time
A total fitness program incorporates aerobic exercise, flexibility training, 
and strength training in a weekly fitness plan. One example of such a plan
includes one easy day and two (non-consecutive) rest days. On the other four
days, work out at a steady pace. No time? Working out for three 15 minute
periods is as effective as working for one 45 minute stretch.
If you have trouble sticking to your fitness routine, make an appointment.
Schedule a standing appointment with yourself to take a brisk walk first thing
in the morning or after dinner each day or make an appointment to get up
earlier in the morning so you have a focused time to work out — put it on the
calendar and stick to it!
Be sure to warm up before each session and cool down afterward. (For more
information, see the “Warming up and cooling down” section later in this
chapter.) In the fitness programs mentioned here, we fit stretching into the
program by doing it as part of our warm-up and cool-down routines, but you
can add more stretching to your program or add a yoga class to your sched-
ule. Stretching improves flexibility and keeps your muscles from getting sore. 
268
Part IV: Lifestyle Issues for Menopause and Beyond 

 Day 1: Start off with a warm-up. Then move onto 20 to 30 minutes of aer-
obic activity followed by 20 minutes of strength training (see the
“Strengthening bones and toning muscle” section later in this chapter).
End your workout with a cool-down that includes at least 5 to 10 min-
utes of stretching.
 Day 2: Do 20 to 30 minutes of aerobic exercise but at a lower intensity
than your Day 1 workout. Remember your warm-up and cool-down time.
 Day 3: Do the Day 1 routine — warm-up, aerobic exercise, strength train-
ing, and then a cool-down with some good stretching. Your intensity
should be the same as that of Day 1.
 Day 4: Take a day off to rest and restore your muscles. Resting is also
important for your body.
 Day 5: Follow the same workout as Days 1 and 3.
 Day 6: This is ladies’ choice day. Do something different for your aerobic
exercise, something a bit lighter — gardening, dancing, yard work, swim-
ming with the kids, or golfing — but do it for 45 minutes rather than a
half-hour.
 Day 7: Take the day to rest and relax to restore your muscles.
269
Chapter 19: Focusing on Fitness
Zoning in on your target heart rate
Your target heart rate tells you how much effort
you put into an exercise. Here’s how you can
check your heart rate:
1. Put your index and middle finger on your
opposite wrist and find your pulse. (You can
also use the carotid artery in your neck,
which is under your jawbone.)
2. Count the number of beats for ten seconds
(you need a clock with a second hand).
3. Multiply that number (the number of beats
in ten seconds) by six. The result is your
number of heartbeats per minute — your
heart rate.
After you know how to figure out your heart
rate, you can figure out your target heart-rate
zone, which is important when exercising. You
should try to keep your heart rate within your
target heart-rate zone during exercise to
achieve the perfect workout intensity and max-
imum benefits.
1. Subtract your age from 220, which is the
maximum heart rate (a heart rate you don’t
want to even approach).
2. Multiply your answer from Step 1 by 0.6. The
resulting number is the lower limit of your
target heart-rate zone.
3. Multiply your answer from Step 1 by 0.85.
The resulting number is the upper limit of
your target heart-rate zone.

Talk to your doctor about your fitness plan first, especially if you haven’t
exercised in a long time, you have heart disease, you’re overweight, or you
have any other medical condition. After you get the okay from your doctor,
consider using a certified personal trainer to guide you.
Flexing through stretching
What’s so tough about stretching? You probably did it back when you were
taking grade-school gym class, doing ballet, or running track, right? Well,
things have changed a bit. In the past few years, medical and exercise experts
have come a long way in understanding the physics behind stretching. Some
of the old stretching exercises actually hurt your body more than they helped
it. Be sure to follow this good advice about stretching while performing the
great stretching routine found in the section, “Warming up and cooling
down,” later in this chapter (see Figures 19-1 through 19-6):
 Stretch during your warm-up and cool-down periods.
 Don’t bounce. Stretch slowly until you feel some tension, not pain.
 When warming up, hold the position for 10 to 30 seconds, relax, and
then stretch again.
 When cooling down, hold the position 30 seconds, relax, and then
stretch again. If you’re working on flexibility, try doing each stretch
twice during the cool-down and stretch a bit further the second time.
If you increase your stretching intensity during the cool-down period
when your muscles are already warm, you can increase your range of
motion and get more out of your stretch. Stretching when your muscles
are warm helps you build flexibility much more quickly because warm
muscles stretch better than cold ones, and elastic and stretched mus-
cles are flexible muscles.
 Never stretch a muscle if you’ve had a recent muscle, ligament, tendon,
joint, or bone injury or if you feel a sharp pain. If you feel a sharp pain —
as opposed to the dull ache of well-exercised muscles — consult your
doctor before continuing with your stretching routine.
If you’re interested in additional information on stretching, take a look at the
resources in Appendix B.
Yoga and Pilates are both terrific activities if you really want to work on your
flexibility, balance, and core strength. Yoga consists of three main compo-
nents: exercise, breathing, and meditation, and Pilates offers exercises
derived from yoga, dance, and other areas. With either, start at the beginning
and be patient with yourself. If you’re interested in finding out more, check
out Power Yoga For Dummies (Doug Swenson, Wiley Publishing, Inc.) and
Pilates for Dummies (Ellie Herman, Wiley Publishing, Inc.).

Part IV: Lifestyle Issues for Menopause and Beyond 

Warming up and cooling down
Be sure to start each workout with an easy warm-up period and end each ses-
sion with a cool-down period. Warming up puts your muscles and cardiovas-
cular system on alert that they’re about to go to work. Cooling down gives
them a chance to relax after a satisfying workout. You can do the same activi-
ties for both your warm-up and cool-down sessions.
Warming up and cooling down can be as simple as walking or cycling for 
5 to 10 minutes and then doing some light, gentle stretching for another 
15 minutes.
Never stretch cold muscles — you can damage them. That’s why you start
your warm-up session with a bit of walking or cycling. Also, don’t bounce or
pull hard as you stretch during your warm-up, a time when your muscles are
still pretty cold.
If you’re worried about time, you may be inclined to skip your warm-up and
jump right into your routine. Not a good idea. Warming up prevents injury
and helps you ease into your workout without straining your muscles.
Starting slowly actually lets you exercise longer.
The six simple stretches shown in Figures 19-1 through 19-6 stretch each of
your major muscle groups. Try holding each stretch for 10 to 30 seconds.
Over time, you may want to try to stretch further, which is great, but don’t
strain your muscles and be sure to stop when you feel tightness — don’t
stretch until you feel pain. If you stretch until you hurt, your muscles actually
begin to contract, and you don’t accomplish anything except hurting your
muscles.

2. Bend one leg so that your knee touches your chest.
3. Lean forward, reach out, and touch your toes.
If you can’t touch your toes, stretch as far as possible without experienc-
ing pain. With time, you’ll be able to get closer and closer.
4. Repeat Steps 1 through 3 with the opposite leg.
1. Lie on your back.
2. Raise your legs in the air and bend them at the knee.
3. Grab both legs behind and below the knee.
4. While keeping your back as flat to the floor as possible, pull your thighs
in toward your chest.
A lot of people tend to cheat at the end of their workout, but definitely do
some light stretching as part of your cool down — it’s terrific for your flexibil-
ity, and can minimize soreness later. 
Exercises for Women with Osteoporosis
The best exercises to prevent or slow down osteoporosis are weight-bearing
exercises — exercises, such as walking and strength training, that include
gravity and tension on your muscles. Stress builds bone (see, stress is good
for something), and putting weight on your bones provides the stress your
Figure 19-6:
Warming up
your lower
back and

274
Part IV: Lifestyle Issues for Menopause and Beyond 

bones need to grow in strength. Weight-bearing exercise promotes bone
growth, which is critical for women of any age. During and after the change,
when your estrogen levels are lower, weight-bearing exercise can keep bones
strong and healthy by increasing bone density.
Although you move your muscles when you swim or cycle, these aren’t the
best exercises for building bone. The water (in swimming) and the bicycle
seat (in cycling) take a lot of the load off your bones.
If you have osteoporosis, your bones may be more liable to break. Weight-
bearing exercises are great for strengthening bone, but increasing your flexi-
bility and balance can also help you avoid osteoporosis-related complications
by reducing your risk of falling and breaking bones in the first place. You can
improve your flexibility by including stretching in your fitness routine (check
out the two preceding sections). And you can improve your balance through
exercise as well. 
Strengthening bones and toning muscle
Walking is a great way to fight osteoporosis, but a combination of walking and
strength training is even better for building bone. You may choose to do both
of these weight-bearing exercise routines on the same day or split them up
during the course of the week. Weight-bearing exercises strengthen only the
bones that you work, so walking strengthens your legs, but it won’t help your
other bones. You need to introduce strength-training exercises into your fit-
ness program to accomplish that feat.
The best strength-training program is one that includes all your major muscle
groups. This type of program improves your bone density in important areas,
but it also improves your balance, which is important in avoiding falls that
can cause fractures.
Start your strength-training regimen with a good, all-around strength-training
routine using the seven exercises shown in Figures 19-7 through 19-13. These
exercises strengthen your chest, arm, shoulder, leg, abdominal, and back
muscles. You can start with three to five repetitions of each exercise and
increase the number as your interest and endurance dictates. If you want to
vary this routine or try some more advanced strength-training exercises,
check out Appendix B for additional resources.

Don’t laugh. It’s not as easy as you may think.
3. Switch sides and lift your left arm and right leg at the same time.
Adding balance to your routine
To avoid falling and possibly breaking a bone, spend some time working on
balance. You can challenge the muscles that keep you balanced in many fun
ways, and you can tone your muscles at the same time. Talk to a personal
trainer to find out more about the following exercise aids:
 Fitness balls: Sometimes called Swiss balls or exercise balls, fitness balls
are becoming very popular because they help you strengthen the core
balancing muscles (abdominal, back, and hip muscles) that you use in
many everyday activities.
If you’re up for a challenge, sit on one of these balls and try to lift your
feet; you can work up a sweat, exercise your abdominal muscles, and feel
like a seal in a sideshow all at the same time. There are a million ways to
use these balls to improve your balance, as well as your muscle tone.
Figure 19-13:
Back

280
Part IV: Lifestyle Issues for Menopause and Beyond 

 Balance boards: Stepping on this board feels like jumping on a moving
surfboard after drinking three glasses of wine. Essentially, a ball is
attached to the bottom of the board to challenge your balance (to say
the least). As you strengthen your “balance” muscles with this contrap-
tion, you improve your overall sense of balance and your muscle tone.
 Exercise tubing: If your friends or family members see you with this
one, they’ll think that you’re playing with a giant rubberband, so you
may want to use this exercise aid in private. Exercise tubing is used in
conjunction with stretching to increase flexibility.
All of these props can help you improve your balance, flexibility, and
strength. They can be used at home or in a health club.
Exercises to Protect Your Heart
A balanced fitness plan will keep you stay healthy after menopause. Aerobic
exercises, which are the core of a good cardiovascular workout, increase
your blood circulation, strengthen your heart muscles, and improve your
cholesterol profile.
Working on and working 
up to heart health
You can choose from any number of great aerobic sports or activities to
improve your fitness. Cycling, jogging, swimming, and stair climbing are few
examples. If you want to vary your workout, try an aerobic activity other
than walking or check out the resources in Appendix B that have more infor-
mation on beginning a fitness plan. 
Exercise is the best gift you can give your cardiovascular system. Just 30 min-
utes of walking five or more times a week can effectively improve your cardio-
vascular health. All you need for walking is a comfortable pair of shoes and
30 minutes. If you need to break your workout up into two 15-minute sessions
or three 10-minute sessions during the day, don’t worry; it still works!
As you improve your cardiovascular fitness, you’ll feel less tired when you
workout even though you’re doing the same amount of exercise. You’ll also
notice that your heart rate will gradually decrease, both during exercise and
when at rest.
281
Chapter 19: Focusing on Fitness

Build your endurance and stamina slowly. Don’t over do it when you first begin
an exercise program. Be sure to stay within your target heart range (see the
“Zoning in on your target heart rate” sidebar earlier in this chapter). If you’re a
beginner, keep to the lower end of your target range until you establish a com-
fortable workout plan. You can lower your risk of heart problems associated
with exercise if you monitor your heart rate. To get the most out of your aero-
bic exercise, exercise at your target heart rate for at least 20 minutes.
A simple way to check whether your workout intensity is appropriate is what
we call the walk-and-talk test. If you’re exerting yourself but you can still carry on
a conversation while you exercise, you’re probably exercising at the right pace.
If you want to continue to build your cardiovascular fitness, increase the
intensity of your workout by increasing the
 Distance you run, walk, swim, or jog
 Speed at which you move
 Time you spend doing the activity
 Number of days you exercise
 Level of difficulty of your course. (If you’re a walker or cyclist, find a
hilly course; if you use a treadmill, increase the incline or spend some
time on a stair-climbing machine.)
As you increase the intensity of your workout, your cardiovascular fitness will
improve and you will burn more calories. But when you make your workout
more challenging, do it slowly and take one step at a time. For example, you
may choose to exercise at the same pace but add another 1⁄2 mile to your walk. 
Walking for fun and fitness
Walking is perhaps the easiest way to begin a fitness program. You don’t need
a bunch of equipment; all you need is the will to get moving. But before you
put your feet to the pavement, you have to map out a route you’ll follow on
you daily trek. Here are some pointers:
 Measure out a 2-mile course that you can easily expand to a 3-mile
course when you want to increase the length of your walk.
 Pick a pretty area in your neighborhood, around your workplace, or at a
local park. Or maybe your neighborhood park or school has a track you
can use (though circling a track can get monotonous).
 Make sure that your route is conveniently located. You don’t want to
give yourself the “it takes too long to get there” excuse.
282
Part IV: Lifestyle Issues for Menopause and Beyond 

For the first two weeks of your new walking regimen, walk the 2 miles three
times a week and time yourself. Your pace should be brisk enough to get your
heart pumping, but not so fast that you can’t talk and breathe at the same time.
A good pace for many folks is to walk 2 miles in about 35 minutes. During Weeks
3 and 4, you can step up your program a bit. Walk four times a week instead of
three. And try to increase your pace — do your 2 miles in a half-hour.
At this point in your exercise progression, you need to check yourself and
see how you feel. How easy was the transition from Weeks 1 and 2 to Weeks 3
and 4? Do you feel like you can do more or are you comfortable with your
current routine? Depending on your age and your health, you may want to
stick with this walking schedule for a while. When you feel your body getting
stronger and your outlook is ready for another challenge, you can move
along to the next level. (For the sake of simplicity, we use a weekly progres-
sion to outline this entire schedule. But remember that your Week 5 doesn’t
have to begin until you are ready for it.)
During the course of the next four weeks, your goal should be to walk 3 miles
five times a week. Work up to this goal slowly. Add 1⁄2 mile to your distance
during Week 5. At that point you’re walking 2.5 miles four times during the
week. Then, for Week 6, walk 2.5 miles again but try to walk five times this
week instead of four times. Keep your pace brisk.
If you’re ready to go on after Week 6, charge ahead and add another half mile
to your distance and walk five times this week. By Weeks 7 and 8, you’ve
reached your goal of walking 3 miles five times a week. But just because
you’ve reached this goal doesn’t mean you can’t aim higher. The important
thing is that you find your comfort level. Many people are fine with this work-
out level for the rest of their lives — it can boost your spirits and your health.
Want to take your program further? You’ve got the idea by now — simply add
distance, go faster, or make the course harder (try gentle hills). If you miss a
workout, don’t beat yourself up about it — just start again the next day —
good habits are hard to break!
It may take you three or four months to reach the goal of 3 miles five times a
week — and that’s fine. It’s not a contest. You’re doing this for yourself and
your health. Your only opponent is inactivity.

E
ventually, perimenopause turns into real menopause. One of these morn-
ings you’ll take a look at your calendar and realize that your last period
was a full 12 months ago. It may occur to you that you haven’t had a hot flash
in ages, and that your moods are smooth and steady. Or you may already be
beyond that magic 12-month marker.
Congratulations: You’re post-menopausal! At 16 or 30 or 45 you might not have
thought of this as a positive milestone. After all, women in their second half
century are old. Dried up. Sexless. Crones. Past their sell-by date. Yeah, right.
Tell that to Tina Turner. Lauren Bacall. Gloria Steinem. Astronaut Sally Ride.
Billie Jean King. Television Journalist Diane Sawyer. Dolly Parton. In fact, try
telling that to any number of your friends, relations, and co-workers who are
active, healthy, lively women of — as they used to say — a certain age.
You’ve seen the joke cards and birthday cake inscriptions: “Life begins at 40.”
Many menopausal women will tell you that, for them, life began at menopause.
In this chapter we talk about why, far from being the end of the line, lots of
women find that reaching menopause marks the beginning of the best stage
of life. We’ll also talk more about the context of your whole life and all that
goes into it, not just about specific health issues.

Going from Menopause to Infinity
Sure, there are health issues to stay on top of after you reach menopause.
Throughout this book we talk about the fact that changes in your body’s pro-
duction of hormones are linked to an increase in your risk for a number of
potential health problems, including
 Cardiovascular disease (look back to Chapters 6, 12, and 16 for more on
heart disease)
 Osteoporosis (bone up in Chapters 5, 15, and 16)
 Hypertension (more in Chapters 5 and 16)
 Weight gain (check Chapter 18 for the skinny on diet and weight)
 Memory loss (wait, wait — oh, yeah, remember to look in Chapters 10
and 15)
But you can take advantage of a couple of ways to make this part of life just
as enjoyable, or even more so, than it always has been: 
 Make healthy lifestyle choices. The best lifestyle choices can help to
minimize health risks. Sticking to a healthy diet and a regular exercise
plan that you love enough to make it a part of your life can go a long 
way toward keeping you young — at heart and everywhere else (see
Chapters 18 and 19).
 See your healthcare provider regularly. It’s important to have a doctor
who views this stage of your life as being promising and full of potential.
When you were a young girl and got your first period, you may have felt
like this was a good time to see a new doctor (maybe a specialist in ado-
lescent medicine, and maybe a woman, if you had been seeing a man up
to this point). 
In many ways, this time of life is a lot like that one. Menopause is just as
much a marker as adolescence was that you’ve reached a new stage in
your development. If you’re happy with your healthcare situation, con-
sider yourself fortunate and stay with the providers you’re seeing now. If
you’re not, though, this is a good time to shop around for a doctor’s or
physician’s associate with whom you feel more simpatico. It seems
ironic to quote the tagline from a cigarette ad campaign when we’re talk-
ing about good health, but here goes. You’ve come a long way, baby.
Make sure your health advisors aren’t stuck back in the 1960s in the way
they view women at midlife and beyond.
286
Part IV: Lifestyle Issues for Menopause and Beyond 

Here are some tips when searching for a new doctor:
• Look for a healthcare provider who sees you as a whole person,
not just a medical history or a bearer of symptoms.
• Help your doctor to avoid stereotypes about aging.
• Look for a doctor who advises you to be as active as possible (then
follow the advice).
• Listen to the way your doctor talks about you and your health. Is
he or she concerned not just with helping you to stay free of dis-
ease, but with your overall wellness and happiness?
Working and Playing Well with Others
Menopause and the changes in your life at this time can affect the people
around you in various ways. This is certainly true of your husband or partner
(who, don’t forget, is also aging). It’s true of your children, your friends, your
boss, your co-workers, and everyone else. 
Managing a family
Menopause can be a funny time for women with families, especially if you still
have children at home. You may have spent the past few years wondering
whether your periods would stop before your daughter’s began. Or wonder-
ing whether you could have just one more baby. Or living in fear of having
one more baby. Whether this makes your life easier or harder, menopause
cuts off some of your choices in this regard. Unless you plan to adopt, or fate
fixes you up with a partner who comes with ready-made kids, you aren’t
going to have more children. 
Of course, you may have children still at home. This can be a wonderful time
with your children. You may have more patience than ever and more of a sense
of perspective on life’s ups and downs. Reaching midlife also seems to make
the clock and the calendar pages turn faster. Suddenly the years of parenthood
seem foreshortened — the years of childhood slip away faster, and your kids
reach new life stages of their own, even as you have. Watching them make this
transition brings a host of competing feelings: delight for them, worry, envy at
their chance to explore new activities and roles, sorrow at their impending
absence, pride at the job you’ve done raising them, or just plain relief.
The other side of this coin is that watching your children grow up may bring
you a sense of sadness that these young years have passed for you. Some
women find this especially true of watching their adolescent daughters reach
their sexual maturity. Envy of youth isn’t pretty, but it happens to all of us to
one degree or another. Try not to beat yourself up about it.
287
Chapter 20: Enjoying a New Lease on Life

You and your partner 
When you married or started living together, or when your children were
born, the dynamic between you and your husband or partner probably
changed dramatically. Instead of going through life face-to-face, concerned
mostly with each other, parenthood repositioned you. Your chief (shared)
responsibility became your child or children. You began to travel through life
side-by-side, facing outward to take care of children, jobs, a home, and all the
responsibilities of adult life.
When the last child moves out, the dynamic will change again. By now you
both probably have too much going on to re-create those intense, face-to-
face, me-and-you-against-the-world days, and you might not want to anyway.
In addition to shared interests outside of the home, the members of most
couples also have interests of their own. 
More than a million older women are abused in a relationship every year. Few
shelters have specific programs for older women, but your need for safety
and security is the same as everyone else’s. If you need help, call the national
domestic violence hotline at any time of day or night: 1-800-799-SAFE (7233).
There are no rules for how a couple should behave at this stage of life together.
Many find that this is a time of renewed togetherness and discovery of the
changed and developed people you both are. Sadly, others find that the
mutual changes in your respective goals, values, and outlook have led to
irreconcilable incompatibilities. We can’t tell you what to expect, except to
advise that change is almost inevitable during this part of your lives together.
288
Part IV: Lifestyle Issues for Menopause and Beyond 
Looking back, looking forward
Progress doesn’t always proceed in a straight
line. Sometimes it’s two steps forward, four
steps backward, and a couple of baby steps
forward again. The first medical text on meno-
pause, published in 1837, offered women reas-
surance that what they were going through
was perfectly normal, that menopause was not
a disease, and didn’t have to be a big deal to get
through: menopause was described as “a tem-
porary inconvenience” was how the enlight-
ened (male) author described the change of
life.
Now try this one on. Almost 100 years after this
enlightened (male!) author spoke so sensibly of
menopause, medical journals took a giant step
backward, and began using phrases such as
“sheer misery,” “hatred between husband and
wife,” and “cow-like passivity and disinterest”
when describing menopause and what couples
and women could expect from these years.
Do yourself and other women a favor, and
refuse to be part of the stereotype, or to put
yourself in the care of any healthcare providers
who foster this kind of attitude.

This can be scary as you search for new footing together. This period can
also be exciting and wonderful, but it almost always takes some hard work,
dedication, and commitment. Find what works for the two of you.
If you find that, for either or both of you, this period is simply agonizing, seek
help from a professional counselor. You might benefit from couples’ (or indi-
vidual) counseling if:
 One or both of you feels angry and resentful.
 One or both of you feels bored and stuck in a rut.
 There are unresolved issues over an infidelity.
 The relationship is physically or emotionally abusive.
If either or both of you are concerned, don’t wait until counseling becomes a
last resort, and don’t assume that the need for counseling means the relation-
ship is over. Think of it instead as an opportunity for course correction and
renewal. Neither of you is the person you were when you got together, so it’s
unrealistic to expect the relationship to be the same. It’s perfectly reason-
able, though, to expect that it can be something new, and something better.
Caring for aging parents
You’re a part of the “sandwich generation.” As our parents live longer and
many of our children stay home longer or return to the nest after leaving,
we’re in the middle, taking care of members of both a younger and an older
generation. Even as you may be offering loving and supportive good-byes to
all the baby birds in your nest and looking forward to having some more
room and time and resources for yourself, or yourself and your partner, new
nest-mates may come to roost in your home. 
289
Chapter 20: Enjoying a New Lease on Life
Sandwiched in between
If you’re taking care of both your kids and one
or more of your parents, you’re not alone:
 Close to half of all Americans between 45
and 55 have dependent children and living
parents.
 The American Association of Retired
People (AARP) says that 22 million Americans
take responsibility for caring for aging par-
ents or other relatives. 
 Most of these caregivers are women (bet
you’re not surprised).
 Most women caring for older parents are
also still employed either full- or part-time.

If you’re one of these people, we know that you know that bearing this much
responsibility — for one or more children, a spouse or partner, one or both
parents, a job, a house, and other responsibilities in the community may
become so great that just having a guest for dinner or having to feed the cat
when your kids forgot to do it can put you right over the top. This kind of
stress can get so bad that your health may begin to suffer.
Be kind to yourself. Take steps to get some help:
 Enlist the assistance of siblings and other family members (including
those kids).
 Call on professional help. Ask your or your parents’ physicians for local
resources, or call your state’s office on aging (look in the blue pages in
your phone book).
 Get some exercise nearly every day, and try to eat right.
 Get a little respite by spending time with friends or engaging in hobbies.
 Investigate adult daycare centers in your area. Even the occasional use
of centers or respite caregivers can give both you and your parents a
break.
 Ask your employer if your company’s Employee Assistance program has
resources for adult caregivers.
Retiring Gracefully (or Not)
Being menopausal at home is one thing. For many women, dealing with
menopausal symptoms at work can be altogether different. In the United
States, women make up roughly half of all the workers in the paid labor force.
Most of these women plan to continue working up until they reach retirement
age. This makes it likely that you’ll go through menopause while you’re still
working.
Taking care of your body on the job
When it comes to workplace issues, some nations are a few steps ahead of
others. In the United Kingdom and Australia, for instance, meeting the work-
place needs of menopausal women is actually an issue that’s being discussed
and worked on.
290
Part IV: Lifestyle Issues for Menopause and Beyond 

If you’re pregnant, laws in the United States and other countries protect your
job. You can’t, for instance, be fired for being pregnant. And if your pregnant
body aches when you stand up all day, the law says they have to give you a
chair — or change your duties, or protect you from potential workplace haz-
ards. We think it would be nice if employment law made basic, compassion-
ate allowances for things such as:
 Making sure perimenopausal women with unpredictable, Niagara-style
periods have access to decent, private bathrooms, and permission to
use them whenever they need to. Ever try teaching a classroom full of
4th graders all morning without being given 10 minutes to change a
tampon?
 Ensuring that a little fresh air actually enters the workplace of women
whose internal thermostats are likely to set themselves, without warn-
ing, to thermonuclear. Nobody loves a workplace princess who hijacks
the air conditioning, but is it too much to ask that the powers-that-be let
you cool off for a few minutes to keep you from passing out?
 Advice, support, and informed personnel in the company health office.
 Time off for medical appointments.
 While we’re at it, how about fewer menopause jokes from the guys in the
boardroom about hot flashes, and more offers of support?
If you’re dealing with menopausal symptoms on the job, try these tips:
 Plagued by hot flashes? Keep cool water or iced tea in the office fridge.
 Dress in layers — say, a cardigan or jacket over a shell — so you can
remove one or two without your co-workers think you’re initiating a
game of strip poker.
 Exhausted after a night of insomnia? In the best of all possible worlds,
call in and say you’ll be working from home today. Don’t work in the best
of all possible worlds? Perk yourself up with a brisk walk on your lunch
break.
Looking before you leap
How does the notion of changing jobs (“At your age?”) make you feel? Terrified?
Amused? Excited and wistful? If you fall into the latter group, it may be just
the right time to think of making the leap to something new. Many women
find that, after they’ve weathered the emotional and bodily changes that
come with menopause, they feel braver and more able to take on lifestyle
changes. The hard truth of knowing that probably a little less than half of
291
Chapter 20: Enjoying a New Lease on Life

your lifespan lies ahead of you may make you view your time as something
that’s more precious than ever. This can make you less patient with a job that
makes you unhappy. 
Don’t let anyone hand you any baloney about old dogs and new tricks. Before
you hand in your two-week notice, however, ask yourself some important
questions: 
 What skills do you have to bring to a new job? What kind of work envi-
ronment do you enjoy? If you can envision your dream job, what does it
look like?
 Do you want a new job because you want a new job, or because you
think it will fix other problems in your life?
 What kind of work environment makes you happy? How busy do you like
to be? Do you enjoy having people around, or do you like to work by
yourself? 
 How long can you afford to be unemployed while you look for or create
another job for yourself?
 How will changing jobs affect your health insurance? 
Finding Your Spirit in Whatever You Do
So you’ve come out — or will soon come out — on the other side of
menopause. Gone are the periods (which, we admit, may be a source of
regret for some). Gone are the hot flashes. Gone are the “menopause
moments” — those brief episodes of frustrating and embarrassing forgetful-
ness. In exchange, you get back your sense of emotional well being, your
equanimity, and your even temper.
Appreciating the upside
Many women find that getting through menopause brings them unexpected
physical, psychological, and emotional gifts:
 Freedom from worrying about an unwanted pregnancy: This can con-
tribute to a freer, richer, more spontaneous sex life, as well as to a sense
of closure with respect to your reproductive years.
 A larger sense of freedom: We don’t just mean freedom from worrying
about whether there’s a maxipad in your purse or a tampon in your
292
Part IV: Lifestyle Issues for Menopause and Beyond 

pocket. We mean a broader sense of freedom from worry about whether
you can take care of yourself and your life, and from worry about what
others will think of you if you speak your mind or do what you want to do.
 More energy: Lots of women talk about not just needing less sleep after
menopause, but of having a greater sense of energy, power, and possibility.
 Less concern with living according to the expectations of others:
In this way, as in others, menopause mirrors adolescence, giving you 
a sense of play and exploration, an open space in which to reinvent
yourself.
 Less tolerance for putting up with things that annoy you or waste your
time, and less tolerance for people who don’t treat you well: Because
(we hope) this is coupled with a diminished likelihood to let anger take
center stage in your emotional life, you probably won’t need to blow
anyone out of the water with your displeasure. At the same time, you
may feel completely comfortable asking an intimidating maître d’ for a
better table, explaining sweetly to your insurance company why they’re
in the wrong to reject one of your claims, or turning down a lunch date
with someone who makes you feel inferior. 
 A reassessment of what’s important in your life. Maybe vacuuming the
living room can wait while you take the dogs for a walk or write in your
journal. Perhaps this is the year to turn the chairmanship of the commu-
nity center bazaar over to someone else so you have time to paint every
morning. Maybe you need to get away by yourself for a weekend once in
a while, just to walk in the woods or meditate or go a whole day without
talking. Or maybe you and your sweet baboo will finally quit putting off
that trip to Paris.
Seeing things in a new light
Midlife and the onset of your post-menopausal years are busy and sometimes
hectic. Still, we find that this is a good place to stop and rest for a moment.
You may find yourself wanting to take stock at this point and ask yourself
some of the big questions:
 Am I happy?
 Am I achieving what I want to be achieving?
 Am I making a positive difference in the lives of the people I love?
 What do I want to do with the rest of my life?
293
Chapter 20: Enjoying a New Lease on Life

Some women, at this stage in their lives, report feeling a sense of spirituality
and connectedness with others that they had never experienced before. You
may have had to deal with the deaths of one or more relatives or friends. You
may even be coping with the death of a spouse or lover. Many women at this
age have faced health scares of their own. In short, while old age is still pretty
far up the road, having to deal with issues of mortality may change the way you
look at life. Sadness is normal in the face of unavoidable crises of this sort, but
so is a bittersweet new sense of perspective on life from beginning to end. 
If you find yourself really unable to move on after the death or illness of a
loved one, or a health crisis of your own, seek counseling.

your life and the lives of those around you. Live every moment as if it is
important — it is.
Living Happily Ever After
Your experience of menopause — and of the many years ahead — will be
shaped by lots of different things:
 Your health
 Your expectations for this time and the expectations of those around you
 The way the other women in your family view menopause and midlife
 The opportunities available to you in your work and your life
When you were a child, people would ask you what you wanted to be when
you grew up. Throughout your life you’ve had to make decisions that have
helped to shape the answer to this question. A handful of choices you’ve
made along the way — about education, romance, employment, where to 
live — have gotten you where you are today. We hope that’s a good place.
Menopause can be viewed in lots of ways: as a journey, a milestone, a process,
a path. We especially like to think of it as a ride that takes you places you’ve
never been before and opens new and unexpected doors in your life. Most of
all, we like to think we’ve helped you not only to survive this little milestone
in your life but to relax and enjoy the ride. 
Now it’s your turn to help the women in your life who are just starting down
the perimenopausal path. Encourage them to stay informed, to take charge of
their own health, and their own lives, and to expect the best (or at least to
not expect the worst) of these years.
Finally, we wish you the best of health and all the happiness in the world.
Most of all, we hope you never stop asking, “Where do I go from here?”

Ten Menopause Myths Exposed
In This Chapter
 Ferreting out the realities of menopause
 Keeping sex sexy after the change
 Determining the accuracy of blood tests
O
ne survey we recently came across shows that half of all women going
through menopause feel unprepared and uninformed to face the change.
Check out these common menopause myths and see how many of them
you’ve heard — and how many you bought into! Because menopause and
misconceptions go hand and hand so often, we couldn’t limit ourselves to 
ten myths in this Part of Tens chapter.
You’re Too Young to Be Menopausal 
in Your 30s and 40s
Not really. Even though most women begin menopause sometime between 
45 and 55 years of age (and the average age is 51), going through menopause
earlier isn’t impossible or unheard of. Making the situation seem even less
cut and dry are those annoying symptoms, such as hot flashes, crying jags,
mood swings, and interrupted sleep, that usually occur years before you
actually quit having periods (official menopause). Those physical changes
that characterize what most people refer to as the change are really more
characteristic of perimenopause (the period of fluctuating hormone levels
leading up to menopause). You can experience perimenopausal symptoms
for a decade before the onset of menopause. So having hot flashes and fertil-
ity issues pop up when you’re in your late 30s and early 40s is perfectly normal.

But keep your gynecologist informed about your periods because skipping
periods during your late 30s or early 40s can also indicate medical problems.
For some women, certain conditions and medical treatments cause the early
onset of menopause, for example:
 Chemotherapy or radiation treatment may cause your ovaries to shut
down early, depending on the type of treatments used.
 If you have both of your ovaries removed, you immediately experience
surgical menopause. The ovaries, once responsible for producing the
active form of estrogen that serves many bodily functions, are gone, 
and menopause begins.
 Prolonged anorexia can cause you to stop menstruating. If the problem
isn’t addressed in time, anorexia can lead to early — and irreversible —
menopause. 
 Autoimmune disorders (diseases of your immune system) and thyroid
problems can result in premature menopause. (Chapter 3 can tell you
more about menopause before age 40.)
If you go through menopause earlier than most women, you may also increase
your risk of developing menopause-related medical conditions, such as osteo-
porosis and cardiovascular disease, earlier. So talk to your doctor about ways
you can prevent these conditions.
Menopause Is a Medical Condition 
That Must Be Treated with Medicine
Not exactly. Remember puberty? Well menopause is puberty in reverse, with
all the accompanying physical and emotional changes. (Sounds like a lot of
fun when we put it that way, huh?) Menopause is not a medical condition in
that it is not a disorder. It’s a natural passage from your reproductive years to
the rest of your life.
Menopause isn’t a condition that requires medical attention any more than
puberty requires medical attention. (The same degree of patience, however —
along with a good dose of humor — is required.) The changes that take place
are normal and natural. The care given to women on their journey through
menopause is meant to alleviate discomfort and prevent disease rather than
to interfere with the natural process. Many women don’t experience any
symptoms at all — they have no discomfort associated with the change, so
there’s nothing to treat. Other women find that herbs or a healthy lifestyle
300
Part V: The Part of Tens 

are effective in relieving symptoms. (We discuss the herbal route in Chapter
17, and Chapters 18 and 19 provide some great information on diet, nutrition,
and exercise.) As it turns out, eating healthy and staying fit go a long way
toward keeping your body and mind healthy without the estrogen they used
to rely on.
Sometimes you need an extra biological boost, which can come in the forms
of food supplements (calcium, for example) and hormone replacement ther-
apy (HRT).
Because lower levels of estrogen over prolonged periods of time can result in
other medical problems, work with your doctor to weigh up the risks and
benefits, consider your own concerns and health history, and find therapies
that are appropriate for you.
Keep in mind that it’s tempting to attribute all symptoms during your peri-
menopausal and menopausal years to menopause. During this time you’re
still as susceptible to the same illnesses and diseases as anyone else, so don’t
be shy about bringing troublesome symptoms to the attention of your doctor.
Menopause Isn’t a Disease, So There’s 
No Need to See a Doctor
Think again. Menopause isn’t a medical condition, but that fact doesn’t mean
you can ignore it. Your doctor should be aware of any new symptoms you
experience or new medical issues that arise as you enter perimenopause and
menopause.
Night sweats, fuzzy thinking, interrupted sleep, hot flashes, mood swings,
fatigue, and irritability are recognized (and annoying) symptoms of peri-
menopause. But these symptoms can also signal more serious medical prob-
lems such as anemia, Epstein-Barr virus, thyroid problems, and other issues.
You want to rule out the more serious medical issues before you assume that
you’re experiencing perimenopause symptoms. So keep track of your symp-
toms: Write down when, how often, and for how long you experience them,
and then share this information with your gynecologist or primary-care
physician.
301
Chapter 21: Ten Menopause Myths Exposed

You may think that the main purpose of a visit to your doctor is to assess
your current health and fix the related problems. But as you reach the point
in your life at which most women enter perimenopause and menopause, your
doctor will spend a greater amount of time trying to prevent the development
of serious conditions including breast cancer, cervical cancer, hypertension,
cardiovascular disease, high blood-cholesterol levels, and more.
You Lose the Urge to Have 
Sex after the Change
Hardly. Nearly half of menopausal women are satisfied with their sex life. If
you do your own poll of your premenopausal friends (or tune into a daytime
talk show), you’ll probably find that the percentages are pretty comparable.
Some women actually find sex more enjoyable and feel sexier than ever. You
don’t have to worry about getting pregnant, you and your partner have some
experience under your belts (so you know how to enjoy yourselves and your
relationship), and you and your special someone may have more time to
spend together.
That said, some women find intercourse to be painful because of vaginal dry-
ness or vaginal atrophy. If this is a problem for you, you can find some great
remedies at the pharmacy or the grocery store. Vaginal moisturizers and
vaginal estrogen pills or creams can be used regularly to treat vaginal dry-
ness. Lubricants can be used during foreplay to eliminate painful intercourse.
Sexual stimulation begets sexual lubrication. In other words, the more you
use it, the slower you lose it. Don’t forget that masturbation can help you
stay in shape, too — orgasms are good for you, no matter how you have
them. In fact, that famous sex doctor, Alfred Kinsey, found that even though
marital intercourse declined as women got older, solitary sexual activity
didn’t decline until women were well past 60. Another study found that even
though women’s overall lubrication and sexual activity declined slightly after
menopause, the frequency and pleasure of orgasm did not. For more about
the change and your sex life (and making changes to your sex life), check out
Chapter 9.

Part V: The Part of Tens 

Irregular Vaginal Bleeding
Always Means Cancer
Not exactly. Almost all perimenopausal women experience irregular men-
strual cycles. In some months, you go 25 days between cycles; in others, you
go 38 days. Some months are heavy, and others are light. Or you may even
skip a month or two. These menstrual irregularities are generally caused by
fluctuating hormones that get out of balance during perimenopause.
If you go through a super-absorbent pad or tampon every couple of hours,
experience bleeding after intercourse, or experience bleeding more often 
than every three weeks, see your gynecologist to find out what’s happening.
Sometimes this type of irregular bleeding can signal more serious problems.
Also, if you’re bleeding between your menses or you bleed after you’ve gone
even six months without a period; please consult your gynecologist right away.
Humps Accompany Old 
Age — End of Story
No way. Women don’t automatically turn into camels as they age. Vertebrae
only collapse and result in spinal humps in some cases of osteoporosis (brittle
bone disease).
If you don’t want to acquire a hump, though, you need to begin strengthening
your bones early in life by getting lots of calcium in your diet and exercise in
your day. Osteoporosis is largely treatable with medicine and can often be
prevented with the help of good nutrition, exercise, and calcium substitutes.
If your bones are in bad shape as you approach menopause, several drugs that
can slow bone deterioration are on the market. The estrogen in hormone ther-
apy is also very effective at slowing the rate of bone loss. A non-pharmaceutical
approach to avoiding a hump is to add some regular strength-building exer-
cises to your week.
303
Chapter 21: Ten Menopause Myths Exposed

Only HRT Can Relieve the Symptoms
False. Although hormone replacement therapy is a very effective way to elim-
inate many annoying menopausal symptoms, it’s not the only way. But before
we get to the matter at hand, we want to remind you that less than half of all
women experience the symptoms we so often associate with menopause (or
perimenopause). So you may get lucky and avoid these symptoms without
any type of intervention. Also, remember that the symptoms, such as hot
flashes, interrupted sleep, fuzzy thinking, mental lapses, and so on, are tem-
porary and may eventually go away in their own time.
Now, if these symptoms are making your life miserable, you can try a number
of different remedies. Start out by adopting a healthier lifestyle. Here are a
few quick ideas (for more info, check out Chapters 18 and 19):
 Cut down on fats and junk foods.
 Eat only moderate amounts of meat and protein.
 Fill your plate with vegetables and fruits.
 Keep an eye on your alcohol intake. (Don’t drink more than three to five
alcoholic drinks a week.)
 Exercise at least three to five days a week for a half-hour each day.
You may also want to try an herbal remedy (such as black cohosh) or include
some soy in your diet. Edamame (a type of large-seed soybean) and tofu are
excellent sources of soy. (For more information on alternative ways to deal
with the change, turn to Chapter 17.)
Women Don’t Need to Worry 
about Heart Attacks
Wrong. Heart disease kills many more women each year than cancer does. 
In fact, the odds are that one out of two women will die of a heart attack or
stroke. Estrogen seems to provide some protection to your cardiovascular
system, so women generally have a lower risk of heart attack than men. After
menopause, when you no longer produce estrogen, your risk of heart attack
and stroke rises. A healthy diet and regular exercise can help lower your risk
of cardiovascular disease.
304
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Most Women Get Really Depressed
During Menopause
False. Actually, women tend to get more depressed during the “procreation”
years than during menopause. However, your emotions can take a tumble
during perimenopause. Irritability, mood swings, and interrupted sleep can
take a toll on your emotions. (For more information on the mental and emo-
tional issues tied to menopause, peruse Chapter 10.) But you can find ways
to alleviate these symptoms. A healthy diet and a regular exercise program
help many women alleviate symptoms. Also a slew of pharmaceutical and
herbal therapies can help resolve mental and emotional symptoms. (Take a
look at Chapter 16.)
If you fought bouts of depression earlier in life, you may see a return of the
symptoms during perimenopause, but remember that perimenopausal symp-
toms are transient and will go away in time. If you experience symptoms or
signs of depression, talk to your doctor.
You’ll Break a Bone If You 
Exercise Too Hard
Nope. Weight-bearing exercise (exercise that puts stress on your bones) is one
of the best ways to help your body build bone. If you have osteoporosis or
your bone density is getting low, the combination of weight-bearing exercise
and calcium supplements (with vitamins D and K and magnesium) will pre-
vent further bone loss.
If you’ve been living a sedentary lifestyle with little or no regular exercise (or
you want to change your exercise regimen), discuss your exercise plan with a
physician before you begin moving that body. Combining exercises that help
your flexibility and balance with a walking program is a good way to get started.
Flexibility and balance exercises can help you avoid falling and fractures.
After you have that body moving, try adding some weight-bearing exercises
to the routine. (Check out Chapter 19 for some terrific suggestions.)
305
Chapter 21: Ten Menopause Myths Exposed

A Blood Test Can Determine Whether
You’re Going Through Menopause
Well, here’s the deal: Many gynecologists will test your levels of follicle stimu-
lating hormone (FSH) to determine whether you’re going through menopause.
FSH is the hormone that tells the ovaries to get a follicle ready — this message
kicks off your menstrual cycle. As your ovaries slow down, your brain tries to
keep things moving at the regular pace, so it shoots out lots of FSH. Also, your
brain doesn’t see much estrogen coming back that says, “Alright already, the
follicles are on their way,” so FSH keeps on coming. Consistently high levels of
FSH indicate the onset of menopause to the medical community.
But here’s the catch: FSH levels will tell you when your ovaries are pretty
close to shutting down follicle production, but they won’t tell you if your 
hormones are in the wild state of fluctuation typical of the perimenopausal
years. Unfortunately, most women are most interested in finding out what’s
going on with their bodies when they just start experiencing weird things
such as hot flashes, mood swings, and heart palpitations. By the time their
FSH levels remain high, they’ve already figured the puzzle out — periods
have pretty much stopped and the test just confirms the logical deduction
that menopause is indeed near.

Chapter 22
Ten Medical Tests for 
Menopausal Women
In This Chapter
 Uncovering common medical problems
 Making an annual trip to the gynecologist’s office
 Relying on early detection of disease
T
his chapter lists some basic health tests that help doctors identify dis-
eases and other problems in their early stages — when they’re more
treatable. (We must confess that we include more than ten tests in this chap-
ter, which kind of goes against the letter, but not the spirit, of the Part of Tens
law.) Early detection is the key to successful treatment of nearly every disease
that affects menopausal women. Avoiding the tests doesn’t mean that you
can avoid the related diseases, so visit your doctors regularly and follow
through with their recommendations.
Pelvic Exam and Pap Smear
No one likes to put their feet in the stirrups and their privates in the saddle
every year, but doing so sure helps you avoid some nasty problems down the
line. You should have an annual gynecological exam. The gynecologist will
check your female organs including your breasts, your vaginal tissue, your
cervix, and your uterus. Your gynecologist will also perform a Pap smear to
test for cervical cancer every year.
If you’ve had a complete hysterectomy for benign reasons, you should have a
pelvic exam and Pap smear (to check for noncancerous medical issues) every
year for three years, and then, the Pap can be done every three years. However,
you still need a breast and pelvic exam every year.

Rectal Exam
Everyone squirms when this exam is the subject at hand. Everybody hates it,
but the risks of postponing a rectal exam can be quite devastating to you and
your loved ones. Regular rectal exams can help detect problems early —
when they can be easily and painlessly treated. Part of this test is a digital
exam in which the doctor checks your organs for signs of disease. The doctor
inserts a gloved finger into your rectum to evaluate the health of your tis-
sues. Keep in mind that the long-term benefits greatly outweigh the short-
term unpleasantness of the procedure. And also remember that your doctor
chose this field of medicine.
The other part of this exam is a fecal occult test, which enables doctors to
check whether you have blood in your stool. This part of the test is neces-
sary because the presence of blood can be an indication of problems, such 
as cancer, in your colon.
You should have a rectal exam once a year during your annual gynecological
physical, especially after age 50.
Colonoscopy
Colon cancer is a form of cancer that progresses very slowly and is readily
treatable. But it’s the third leading cause of cancer deaths among American
women. No one likes the test — it’s that simple. And women avoid discussing
the issue until they have symptoms. The problem is that patients very often
don’t experience any symptoms until the disease is in an advanced stage — 
a point when successful treatment is much more difficult.
While performing a colonoscopy, your doctor can find and remove precancer-
ous polyps (doctors know them as adenomatous polyps) before they have a
chance of becoming cancerous. The night before your colonoscopy, you drink
a potion that helps clean out your colon. While you’re under the influence of
a light sedative, the doctor inserts a flexible scope into your colon that allows
her to view the colon walls in search of polyps or other unhealthy tissue. If
she finds a polyp, she can remove it and send it to the lab for analysis. Lab
analysis determines if the polyp is benign or precancerous.
Want to cut your risk of colon cancer by one-third? All you have to do is regu-
larly schedule (and go through with) a colonoscopy. If you’re over 50, have a
colonoscopy every five years — more often if you have polyps, or if you have
a family history of either colon cancer or polyps.
308
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Bone-Density Screening
If you have strong risk factors for osteoporosis (such as a history of anorexia
or many family members who have had bone density problems), your doctor
may recommend that you get a baseline bone-density screening at around 40.
The results provide your doctors with something to compare future screen-
ings to. If you show signs of bone loss in this or subsequent tests, you’ll have
bone screenings every two years.
If you’ve never had a bone screening, you’re over 40, and you have no spe-
cific factors that put you at especially high risk, talk to your doctor about
whether you need a bone screening, and if so, when.
Mammogram
Early detection is the key to reducing your risk of breast cancer, so you
should begin getting annual mammograms when you’re 40 years old with a
baseline taken at age 35. If your mother or sister has had breast cancer, get
your first mammogram even earlier, when you’re 30.
The American Cancer Society recommends that you get a mammogram every
one to two years after age 40 and every year after you turn 50. Other groups
advise less frequent mammograms. In our opinion, annual mammograms are
your best bet even if scientists are still debating the merits of a yearly regimen.
Cholesterol Screening
A cholesterol screening checks your total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol (bad cho-
lesterol), HDL cholesterol (good cholesterol), and triglycerides (another form of
fat found in your blood) and computes your cholesterol ratio. Take this simple
blood test every five years. You should take it when you’re fasting — nothing to
eat or drink for 12 hours before the test. If your doctor identifies problems with
your cholesterol or triglyceride levels or you have a history of high blood pres-
sure, diabetes, thyroid problems, or obesity, your doctor may want to screen
you more frequently.
If you have diabetes, make sure you have a complete cholesterol screening
every year.
309
Chapter 22: Ten Medical Tests for Menopausal Women

Fasting Blood-Glucose Test
Adult-onset diabetes can lead to coronary heart disease, so you want to diag-
nose this problem early. Begin having your blood sugar (glucose) tested when
you’re 20 and repeat the test every three to five years — more frequently if
you experience problems. The blood-glucose test is a simple blood test
administered after you’ve had nothing to eat or drink for 12 hours (that’s
where the fasting part of the name comes from). You can also screen for 
diabetes by checking for sugar in your urine.
Thyroid Screening
The symptoms of thyroid problems and the symptoms of menopause can be
quite similar. Get your first thyroid screening at age 35. The screening measures
your levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (THS) and thyroid antibodies.
Ovarian Hormone Screening
Out of necessity, the standard practice for prescribing hormone therapy is 
a method of trial and error — a “try this regimen and let me know how you
feel” kind of approach. Everybody processes hormones differently, so the
amount of hormone in a medication isn’t the amount that reaches your blood-
stream. For example, the same form of estrogen may affect two women differ-
ently. And your body may respond better to some estrogens than others. 
The key to what “works” and what doesn’t is the amount of estradiol (the
active form of estrogen) your body produces in response to the estrogen
you’re taking. The only accurate way to know how much estradiol you’re
churning out is to draw blood and analyze it for hormone levels. (Saliva 
tests are available, but they’re less accurate.)
That said, the majority of doctors stick with the standard dosing formulas
and do the trial-and-error thing until you tell them you’re feeling better. You
do have the option of having a hormone screening to find out whether you’re
in menopause, or how far along you are on the road toward it, but not many
doctors recommend it. Estradiol levels below 90 pg/ml result in the typical
hot flashes, interrupted sleep, mood swings, and other annoying peri-
menopausal symptoms. If your estradiol level is closer to 20 or 30 pg/ml, 
you are almost certainly in menopause. 
310
Part V: The Part of Tens 

That said, ovarian hormone screening is far from perfect. For starters, estro-
gen levels fluctuate quite a bit during your cycle. Secondly, if you’re peri-
menopausal, your cycles are not as reliable as they used to be, so it’s hard 
to tell exactly where you are at any given time. The symptoms you’re experi-
encing are likely to tell you as much — you’re perimenopausal — as a blood
test will.
Stress Test
You may think that your life has been one big stress test, but actually, a stress
test is a legitimate medical procedure. A stress test is basically an electrocar-
diogram (EKG) that a technician performs while you walk on a treadmill. You
may have had an EKG in the past to qualify for life insurance or as part of an
annual exam. The purpose of the test is to see how your heart responds to
the stress of exercise. If you’re overweight, have high blood pressure, or
experience chest pain or shortness of breath with mild exertion, your doctor
may suggest a stress test. Your doctor may also perform a stress test to
check out your heart before you begin a new exercise program.
The procedure is simple. A technician sticks some electrical wires on your
chest to record the electrical activity in your heart. This information tells 
the doctor if your heart is getting enough oxygen or if it’s been damaged. To
stress your heart, you walk on a special treadmill while you’re plugged into
the EKG.

Ten Terrific Fitness Programs 
for Menopausal Women
In This Chapter
 Walking your way to better health
 Swimming for shore
 Developing a hankering for yoga
N
eed help getting your fitness program off the ground? In this chapter,
we provide some great suggestions to help you clear the runway.
Many women dread the thought of a workout, because to them, the concept
implies sweat, finding time that they don’t have, and too much effort. If this
description fits you, think again. You can find a workout that fits your sched-
ule and your desired level of energy output. (If you hate to sweat, check out
the water-based workouts we include in this chapter.)
Be sure to warm up and cool down for five to ten minutes before and after
you workout. If you have trouble with your heart, blood pressure, choles-
terol, or diabetes; if you suffer from a respiratory condition; if you’re over-
weight; if you smoke; or if you’ve been a couch potato for more years than
you can remember, discuss your physical-fitness plans with your doctor
before getting started. And think of your weekly fitness routine as a buffet.
Include a little of everything on your plate — aerobic training, strength train-
ing, and flexibility and balance-building exercises.
Core Strength Training
Core-stability training and weight training are great ways to improve your bal-
ance and flexibility, reduce your risk of injury, and lessen your amount of
soreness associated with performing daily activities. Core stability training is

basically strength training that targets the muscle groups that make up the
core of your body — the abdominal, lower-back, hip, and pelvic muscles are
the primary focus. Strengthening your core muscles allows them to do their
job (maintaining your body’s stability and balance) better. Adding weight
training to your workout maintains strength, raises your metabolism, and is
great for your bones. (For more on safely working with weights, check out
Weight Training For Dummies, by Liz Neporent, Suzanne Schlosberg, and
Shirley Archer, and Ten Minute Tone-Ups For Dummies, by Cindy Targosz, 
both published by Wiley.)
These muscles are the foundation of support for just about any activity your
body does. The everyday aches and pains that many women feel are often
the result of weakened core-muscle groups. Your body tries to compensate
for these weak muscles, which can lead to pain in your lower back and arm
and leg joints.
Here’s how core strength training works: You incorporate exercises that chal-
lenge your abdominal, lower-back, hip, pelvic, and oblique muscles. You can
strengthen these muscles with traditional exercises and callisthenic-type
movements. (Chapter 19 is full of great exercises to help you strengthen
these muscles, and we include even more resources in Appendix B.)
Some additional toys are available that can add variety and fun to your work-
out and make your workout more effective. Equipment such as balance balls,
stability boards, and old-fashioned medicine balls makes targeting the mus-
cles that help maintain your stability and balance easier. Strengthening these
muscles can also improve your posture.
Walking
Walking is an inexpensive and convenient way to relieve stress, improve your
fitness, and build muscle tone. However, only 6 percent of people who get all
their exercise from walking meet the U.S. Surgeon General’s guidelines for fit-
ness. To make sure that your efforts bring you good health, walk
 At least 30 minutes per session
 At least four times a week
 At a moderately intense pace. You should cover about 31⁄2 miles in an
hour (or 13⁄4 miles in a half hour). For more on how hard to work when
you work out, see “Zoning in on your target heart rate” in Chapter 19.
Chapter 19 has a whole section on how to design a walking program.
314
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Elliptical Training
The elliptical-training machine is a terrific way to get aerobic exercise with-
out hurting your joints with high-impact workouts. An elliptical trainer looks
like a combination of a treadmill and a climber that grew arms! The machine
is called an elliptical trainer because your feet move in the shape of an oval
during the workout instead of back and forth like they do on a treadmill or up
and down like they move on a climber. Because your feet follow an oval path,
the exercise is low impact but still provides a full range of motion for your
legs. The arms on the machine go back and forth while you stride, so you get
a total body workout.
Running
Running reduces your risk for developing heart disease, high blood pressure,
adult-onset diabetes, and several types of cancer. It also increases the levels
of good (HDL) cholesterol in your blood, which helps you get rid of the bad
(LDL) cholesterol. (For more information on cholesterol levels, see Chapter
5.) Running also improves your cardiovascular and respiratory systems and
can help you control your weight. (Some people lose up to 12 pounds the
first year they start running without reducing the calories they eat.)
Getting started on a running regimen is easy; all you need to do is chart out a
course (in a safe area) and get a pair of good running shoes. If you’re a begin-
ner, try running a mile. If you can’t do a mile, try alternating between running
and walking until you can cover the entire mile without the walking part.
Then add a little distance at a time. Initially schedule about 30 minutes of
running time and build up the duration as you go.
Swimming
Swimming is easy on your joints and helps build muscle strength equally on
both sides of your body. In fact, swimming forces you to use all of your mus-
cles. Now that’s what we call a workout! It’s a great exercise for people look-
ing to increase their overall physical fitness and endurance or recover from
an injury.
If you’ve had a hip or knee replaced or you suffer from arthritis, swimming is
an excellent way to maintain aerobic conditioning through low-impact exercise.

Cycling
Perhaps walking and running are too slow for you, and you’re not really a
water person. Taking up cycling, whether in the gym or on the road, may be
for you. Cycling is a great aerobic workout that improves your cardiovascular
health, muscle tone, and stamina.
If you’re just getting started, you may want to try a stationary bike at your local
YMCA or health club. Try riding for six minutes at 15 miles per hour (or 55 rev-
olutions per minute), five times a week. Gradually work up to 20 to 25 minutes,
five times a week, at the same speed. As you become accustomed to cycling,
you can build your aerobic fitness even more by increasing your speed.
After spending some time in the saddle, you may want to try a spinning class.
A spin class is a group indoor-cycling class that can really help you build your
aerobic fitness. You can find spin classes at many YMCA locations, commu-
nity colleges, and health clubs across the country. An instructor guides each
class and makes your “ride” on a special stationary bike as challenging as
you like.
If you’re more of the outdoor type, get that bicycle out of the garage, check
the brakes and tires, and take it out for a ride. Don’t forget about safety:
Always wear a helmet and choose a course in a safe neighborhood that has
little traffic and contains few hills.
Start by riding for ten minutes on a relatively flat course (preferably away
from traffic) five times a week. Add two minutes to your workout each week
(riding five times a week) so that by the end of Week 11 you’re riding for 30
minutes five times a week.
Yoga
Yoga is a great way to improve your health. Studies have shown that yoga can
reduce stress, lower blood pressure, relieve arthritis, and build strength and
flexibility. The breathing techniques used during a yoga workout help increase
the oxygen levels in your blood.
Some styles of yoga focus more on spiritual aspects, such as meditation or
chanting, and are great for stress reduction and relaxation. Other forms focus
on body alignment and challenging workouts that improve muscle tone, bal-
ance, and flexibility. All forms of yoga use poses and breathing techniques to
316

heighten the mind-body connection. You can pull out your copy of Yoga For
Dummies (Georg Feuerstein, Wiley Publishing, Inc.) for more information.
What? Don’t have one? You may want to check it out.
T’ai Chi
T’ai chi helps stretch and tone muscles, relieve stress, and improve balance
and circulation. It may even lower your blood pressure. This ancient, Chinese
form of exercise, meditation, and self-defense involves controlled movements
done slowly and continuously. The forms are similar to those used in other
martial arts. If t’ai chi sounds like it may be up your alley, T’ai Chi For Dummies
(Therese Iknoian with Manny Fuentes, Wiley Publishing, Inc.) is one place 
to start.
Pilates
Even though Pilates (puh-lah-teez) entered fitness centers fairly recently, its
roots actually date back to the 1920s. You can think of Pilates as a combina-
tion of yoga, stretching, and calisthenics all rolled up into one set of exercises.
These exercises work on many of the same muscle groups as a core-stability-
training program (check out our “Core Strength Training” section earlier in this
chapter) and offer many of the same advantages. In Pilates, you perform slow,
extremely focused movements that work the muscles in your abdomen, lower
back, and buttocks. And yes, there’s a snazzy yellow-and-black covered book on
this subject too — Pilates For Dummies (Ellie Herman, Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
Water Aerobics
Here’s a great exercise for women who feel out of place jumping around in an
aerobics class in front of a bunch of other people. Why’s it so great? Your legs
are under water — if you miss a step or have to take a breather, no one’s the
wiser. Water aerobics helps you work your cardiovascular system, arm mus-
cles, and leg muscles. It’s less stressful on your joints than a lot of exercise
programs, which makes it a great exercise for people with arthritis, and it
improves your balance and coordination. Many health clubs and YMCA loca-
tions offer classes led by professional trainers. Water aerobics is a great way
to have fun, stay cool, and get active.

Ten Powerhouse Foods for
Menopausal Women
In This Chapter
 Ten foods for a healthier lifestyle
 Tips for buying, storing, and preparing them
T
here are thousands of healthy, delicious foods out there that are great 
for women at any age and have special nutritional benefits during your
menopausal years (and beyond). These are some of the stars of this lineup.
Soy Joy
Soy is the queen of powerhouse foods. Researchers believe that soy offers
benefits to perimenopausal women in the form of reduced menopausal symp-
toms (such as hot flashes). Soybeans and their derivatives contain proteins
and isoflavones (plant estrogens) that may lower cholesterol. Some researchers,
however, are concerned that plant estrogens may have some of the same
effects as regular estrogens, and that too much soy may even promote the
growth of estrogen-sensitive cancers.
Most doctors agree that a serving a day of soy products is probably safe.
Tofu and other soy products are excellent sources of protein, iron, and cal-
cium, making them a staple for vegans, vegetarians, and those who want to
limit their consumption of animal fats.
In addition to the salt, sweet, bitter and sour tastes we all recognize, gas-
tronomes have identified a fifth basic flavor called umami (sometimes spelled
umame). Umami is described as savory and meaty. Cheeses, mushrooms, sea-
weed, fish sauce, nuts, and soy products have this flavor.

Soy crumbles, a kind of textured vegetable protein, can stand in for ground
meats in soups, chili, or pizza. Soymilk doesn’t taste much like cow’s milk,
but can be a reasonable substitute if you’re a vegan or lactose intolerant. You
can eat edamame (green soy beans) as a snack, or sprinkle them into salads
or pasta dishes. Tempeh, a solid form of soy with a chicken-like texture, can
be grilled or roasted. Tofu in its different forms can be blended, stir-fried,
grilled, or drained and crumbled. Miso, a smooth, salty, savory soy paste,
adds that delicious umami hit to many foods — stir a spoonful into salad
dressing or soup. 
Nuts to You
It’s true, nuts are a fatty food, but their fats are largely unsaturated. Besides,
we’re not suggesting you eat ounces and ounces of them every day. Nuts
such as walnuts and almonds contain linoleic and alpha-linoleic fatty acids
(good-for-you fats), antioxidants, magnesium, vitamin E, selenium, and other
nutrients. They’ve been touted for their beneficial effects fighting blood clots
and osteoporosis. 
Think of nuts as accessory foods — the gold belt on your little black dress.
Chop and add to salads, pasta, stir-fries, fruit dishes, and desserts, or just
grab a few whenever you’re struck by the urge to munch something crunchy. 
Catch of the Day
One: fish is really good for your heart and cardiovascular system. Two: fish
can be a source of unhealthy toxins. Which is true? Both. But because fish
really is a very heart-healthy food, adding 1 or 2 servings a week to your diet
is a great way to take care of yourself and treat yourself. At the same time,
doing what you can to minimize your risk of exposure to the mercury fish
around the world have picked up through exposure to environmental pollu-
tion is important. 
Fish is delicious and versatile, and the tastiest ways to prepare it tends to be
quick and simple. But we also love fish because it’s high in protein and con-
tains heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids, the kind that lower bad LDL choles-
terol and raise healthy HDL cholesterol. A diet rich in fish may also help to
protect you from blood clots, inflammation, osteoporosis (especially fish
canned with the bones), arthritis, and certain cancers.
320
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Keep your mercury exposure low while you enjoy the benefits of fish. The
Environmental Working Group’s online calculator (http://www.ewg.org/
issues/mercury/20031209/calculator.php) uses your weight to deter-
mine how much tuna you can safely eat every week. Some fish markets now
buy their fish from merchants who test and certify their products as being
mercury-free — ask your fishmonger for more information.
The sky (or the sea) is the limit when it comes to cooking fish. Grill it, broil it,
bake it, steam it, just don’t slather it with mayonnaise or bread it and fry it. 
I Yam What I Yam
Are those yams or sweet potatoes at the grocery store? Both are terrific for
you and easy to prepare, but yams have an edge over sweet potatoes when 
it comes to nutrition. Yams are yummy, inexpensive, and a great source of
antioxidants, vitamin C, potassium, magnesium, vitamin B6, and fiber. Eating
them regularly has been linked to a decrease in hot flashes. 
Select yams that are firm, without cracks or blemishes. Bake, mash, or steam
them, or cut into small pieces and add them to vegetable stir-fries. Store
yams in a cool spot (not the fridge, and never in plastic bags) out of direct
sunlight, and use within 10 days of purchase. 
The Berry Blues
Okay, we admit it, we’re partial to blueberries, but we can sneak in lots of
other berries under the same heading and still stay within our “Ten Power-
house Foods” limit. When your mom said to eat your fruits and vegetables,
she might as well have said, “eat your colors,” because deeply colored fruits
and veggies tend to have the most nutrients.
Berries are delicious and fun to pick. Blueberries are high in vitamin C and
fiber, and they pack a whopping 38 percent more antioxidants than other
berries. But cranberries also offer up a healthy helping of vitamin C, and are
well-known fighters of urinary-tract infections. Raspberries have similar bene-
fits, and a serving of strawberries has even more vitamin C than your recom-
mended daily allowance. Eat them by the handful, toss them onto cereal or
oatmeal, fold them into muffins, or mix them together for an all-berry fruit
salad.
321
Chapter 24: Ten Powerhouse Foods for Menopausal Women

Flax Flying
Flaxseeds, like soy products, are a great source of phytoestrogens. Flax packs
a lot of nutrition into its tiny, teardrop-shaped seeds. The oil hidden within the
seed contains essential fatty acids that have been associated with lowered
cholesterol. Flaxseed may also be valuable for its cancer-fighting properties. 
A very small percentage of people are allergic to flaxseed. Start with only 1⁄4
teaspoonful a day, and call your doctor immediately if you experience allergy
symptoms such as a rash or shortness of breath. 
Flaxseed must be ground (in a mill rather like a pepper mill) in order for your
body to absorb its nutrients. Because the oils spoil rapidly, only grind what
you’re going to use within a few days and refrigerate what you don’t use
immediately. Sprinkle over cereals, salads, and soups, or mix into breads and
muffins. Bottled flax oil can also be used, but heating destroys its benefit, so
don’t cook with it. 
Orange You Glad . . .
. . . we didn’t say bananas? Yeah, bananas are great for you, too (the fiber! the
potassium!), but oranges have their own appeal (ouch).
With only about 60 calories in a medium orange and a boatload of vitamin C,
fiber, antioxidants, and other beneficial nutrients, oranges are associated with a
decreased risk of stomach and other cancers, and have anti-inflammatory prop-
erties that promote healing. Eaten (or drunk the form of orange juice) when 
you take your iron supplement, oranges promote absorption of iron. Eat them
plain, drink their juice, or slice them and add to salads, stir-fries, and Asian
dishes. Even orange zest (the bright orange part of the orange peel) contains
nutrients — add it to salads, drinks, and savory stews. 
If you and milk are no longer friends, look for calcium-enriched orange juice.
Sadly, there is still no rhyme for “orange.” 
Tea for You
Tea’s just so darned civilized that if we were stranded on a desert island we’d
probably be okay as long as we’d brought some along. Besides being delicious
and somehow both calming and stimulating, both green and black teas are 
322
Part V: The Part of Tens 

terrific for you. Tea contains the most powerful antioxidant polyphenols of
any food, making it effective at fighting the cell damage associated with inflam-
mation and heart disease. Tea also has cancer-fighting properties. Drinking 
tea — hot or iced — is still the most common way to take it. Some Asian
recipes also incorporate tea leaves into stir-fries and marinades. Tea ice 
cream is increasingly widely available.
Green tea is made from tea leaves that haven’t been fermented like black tea.
Herb teas, while sometimes delicious and nutritious, are not true teas at all.
Only leaves from the Camellia Sinensis plant are true tea leaves.
It’s Easy Eating Greens
It was too hard to select just one leafy green — here’s the whole group. We
may not have loved them when we were little kids, but we do now. Leafy,
green vegetables such as kale, spinach, bok choy, Swiss chard, mustard
greens, turnip greens, collard greens, and all their friends and relations have
earned a place at our tables. Leafy greens all differ a little from each other,
but in general they’re marvelous sources of iron, fiber, vitamin C, manganese,
calcium, copper, B vitamins, and antioxidants.
With greens, the less cooking the better. Some are best gently steamed or stir-
fried, some are happy to be eaten raw in salads. Store greens, unwashed and
wrapped gently in paper towels and placed in a plastic bag, in the refrigera-
tor. Before using, rinse well, drain or pat dry, and chop or tear into the right-
sized pieces for your recipe.
Yo! Yogurt!
Even if you’re not a huge fan of dairy foods, or if you’re lactose intolerant and
have trouble digesting lactose (the sugar in milk and milk-based foods), you
can still be friends with yogurt. Periodically there are reports of people in
various parts of the world who claim that yogurt helps members of their cul-
ture (no pun intended) to live to be 120 years old or more. Although we can’t
vouch for that, we can confirm that yogurt’s a fabulous source of calcium,
perfect for helping you to stave off osteoporosis. 
323
Chapter 24: Ten Powerhouse Foods for Menopausal Women

If your doctor prescribes antibiotics, eating yogurt every day while you’re
taking the medicine can help to prevent the stomach upsets that can accom-
pany antibiotics. It can also help to ward off another unfortunate conse-
quence of antibiotic use: vaginal yeast infections. Be sure to look for yogurt
that contains live Lactobacillus acidophilus cultures. 
Is frozen yogurt better for you than ice cream? There’s no easy answer to this
one. On average, frozen yogurt has less fat than ice cream, but depending on
the brand and the flavor, frozen yogurt may have plenty of sugar and almost
as many calories as ice cream. To be safe, treat frozen yogurt as an occa-
sional treat, and read the label to be sure of what you’re getting.
Yogurt’s great straight from the carton, but it’s also wonderful spooned 
over granola or other cereals, or mixed with fruit salad. Try to avoid heavily
sweetened varieties, and choose low-fat or fat-free over whole milk yogurt. 
If you’d rather not eat it plain, mix in a little fresh fruit or a spoonful of fruit
spread. Yogurt can also take the place of some or all of the mayonnaise or
sour cream in salad dressings to lighten them up. When buying yogurt, look
for the words “active yogurt cultures” or “Contains Lactobacillus acidophilus
cultures” on the label.

L
iterature on menopause is often filled with a dazzling
array of medical terms, jargon, and other overstuffed
phrases. We, of course, try to simplify this state of affairs.
But, in case you run across a word that you need a quick
definition for, whether it’s in this book or other literature
about menopause, we include a glossary of terms —
Appendix A. In Appendix B, we provide you with a bunch
of additional sources of information — from books to Web
sites —that do a great job covering menopause and other
health-related issues of interest to women.

Appendix A
Glossary
Adenomatous polyp: Pre-cancerous polyp in the lining of the colon.
Amenorrhea: Condition in which menstrual periods cease because of some
congenital defect, malnutrition, hormone imbalance, or other cause (includ-
ing normal ones such as pregnancy).
Androgens: Hormones that produce masculine effects on the body, such as a
deep voice and facial hair. Both men and women produce androgens,
although women produce them in much smaller amounts.
Angina: Pain in the chest, arm, or neck caused by lack of blood flow to the
heart. Angina is often a symptom of coronary artery disease.
Antioxidant: A substance, such as vitamins A, C, E, or beta-carotene, that
protects cells from damaging oxidation, which appears to encourage aging
and certain diseases.
Aromatase inhibitors: A class of drugs which decrease the amount of estro-
gen your body produces after menopause.
Arteriosclerosis: See atherosclerosis.
Atherosclerosis: A type of arteriosclerosis in which cholesterol and other
fatty substances build up in the walls of blood vessels, causing narrowing of
the blood vessels. Sometimes referred to as hardening of the arteries. It can
lead to coronary artery disease.
Atrophy: See vaginal atrophy.
Bisphosphonates: A group of medications used to treat osteoporosis that
stimulate bone growth and slow down bone destruction.
Body Mass Index (BMI): A formula for estimating body fat using a weight-
to-height ratio. For weight in pounds and height in inches, BMI = Weight/
Height2 × 704.5.

BRCA1: A gene responsible for controlling cell growth. Inheritance of an
abnormal version of this gene increases your risk of developing breast
cancer.
BRCA2: A gene responsible for controlling cell growth. As with BRCA1, inheri-
tance of an abnormal version of this gene raises your risk of developing
breast cancer, but BRCA2 also increases your risk of ovarian cancer.
Carcinoma in situ: Condition in which abnormal cancer cells are contained
within a specific location within the body and haven’t spread to other areas.
At this stage, most cancers can be successfully treated.
Cardiovascular disease (CVD): Disease that affects the heart, arteries, veins,
and capillaries.
Cholesterol: A fat-like substance that comprises an important part of the
body’s cells. At normal levels, cholesterol performs important functions
involving certain hormones and nutrients. In excess, cholesterol is associated
with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Three forms of cholesterol
are found in blood: high-density lipids (HDL), low-density lipids (LDL), and
very-low-density lipids (VLDL). Found in all foods made from animals.
Combination therapy: A type of hormone therapy that includes both 
estrogen and progesterone.
Conjugated estrogens: A mixture of estrogens sometimes used in hormone
therapy. They’re chemically different from human estrogen and can come
from either plants or horses.
Continuous combination therapy: A type of hormone therapy regimen in
which a woman takes estrogen and progestogen together throughout the
month.
Coronary artery disease (CAD): A disease in which the blood vessels that
feed the heart become narrow and restrict blood flow to the heart.
Atherosclerosis is the process that leads to coronary artery disease.
Coronary heart disease (CHD): Damage to the heart resulting from coronary
artery disease. Because the terms are so similar, many people use them
interchangeably.
Corpus luteum: A yellow sac formed from the remains of the follicle after the
follicle releases an egg. The corpus luteum produces progesterone if the egg
is fertilized.
328
Part VI: Appendixes

Cyclic combination therapy: A type of hormone therapy regimen in which a
woman takes estrogen by itself for several days of the month, followed by a
period in which she takes estrogen and progestogen.
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Blood clots in the veins near the bones that are
surrounded by muscle (usually the upper arm, thigh, or pelvic areas). These
veins lie deeper under the skin than surface veins and return more blood to
the heart. A clot in one of these veins can be fatal if not detected and treated.
DEXA: Abbreviation for dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry — a method of mea-
suring bone-mineral density. Used to screen for osteoporosis.
DHEA: Abbreviation for dehydroepiandrosterone, a male hormone produced
in a woman’s adrenal glands and ovaries.
Dowager’s hump: A slang term for the appearance of a hump in the back
associated with osteoporosis. Caused by the collapse of vertebrae in the
spine due to porous, brittle bones. The term comes from the outdated idea
that osteoporosis is a condition that only strikes postmenopausal women
(little old ladies, or dowagers).
Endometrium: The lining of the uterus.
Estradiol: The active form of estrogen made in the ovaries prior to
menopause. The most potent form of estrogen in humans. Plays a role in
many bodily functions.
Estriol: Form of estrogen only produced during pregnancy.
Estrogen: A female hormone produced in the ovaries and in the adrenal
glands.
Estrogen receptor: A “docking station” on a cell that allows that particular
body part to make use of estrogen. Estrogen receptors are located all over a
woman’s body but are highly concentrated in estrogen-sensitive tissues such
as uterus and breast tissue.
Estrone: A type of estrogen made by the ovaries, adrenal glands, and body
fat before menopause. After menopause, body fat makes estrone; therefore,
estrone is the only type of estrogen in good supply after menopause. Estrone
is less active than estradiol estrogen.
Fibrinogen: A type of protein that helps blood clot.
329
Appendix A: Glossary

Follicle: A little sac created from an oocyte (seed) in the ovary. The follicle
produces estrogen in the ovary. At least one of these little guys releases an
egg each month during a woman’s reproductive years. After the egg is
released, the follicle is called a corpus luteum.
Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH): A hormone produced in the brain that
promotes ovulation by triggering the ovaries to begin developing follicles.
Doctors consider continued high levels of FSH to be an indication of
menopause. The FSH keeps trying to stimulate follicle production when the
cupboard is bare — the ovary can no longer crank out follicles — which is a
sign that the ovary is entering retirement and you’re entering menopause.
HDL: Abbreviation for high-density lipid. HDL is “good” cholesterol because
it can carry fat from the body cells back to the liver for excretion. Lipids
are made up of protein and fat. Lipids with more protein than fat are called
high-density lipids; lipids with more fat than protein are called low-density
lipids (LDL).
Hormone: Chemicals produced in organs that travel through the body to
activate or moderate functions in other parts of the body.
Hormone-receptor site: A “docking station” on a cell where hormones can
connect to cells to manipulate them.
Hormone replacement therapy (HRT): See hormone therapy.
Hormone therapy (HT): Treatment designed to adjust hormone levels using
synthetic or natural female hormones. Doctors generally administer this
treatment to women going through perimenopause and/or menopause.
Hypertension: Another name for high blood pressure.
Hysterectomy: Surgical removal of the uterus. A simple hysterectomy removes
only the uterus. A complete hysterectomy removes the uterus and the ovaries.
A complete hysterectomy causes surgical menopause.
Incontinence: The inability to “hold it” or keep from urinating.
Interstitial cystitis (IC): A bladder condition that’s hard to diagnose, but the
symptoms include mild discomfort, pressure, tenderness, or intense pain in
the bladder and surrounding pelvic area. Symptoms may include an urgent
need to urinate (urgency), a frequent need to urinate (frequency), or a combi-
nation of these symptoms.
Isoflavone: See phytoestrogen.
330
Part VI: Appendixes

Labia: The lips of the vaginal opening. See also vulva.
LDL: Abbreviation for low-density lipids. LDLs are found in the bloodstream
and are thought to carry cholesterol from the liver to body cells. Eating a diet
high in saturated fats and cholesterol will raise your LDL levels. The higher
the LDL level, the greater the incidence of heart attack or coronary artery
disease.
Libido: Sex drive.
Lobules: Milk-producing glands in the breast. Cancer sometimes starts in the
lobules.
Luteinizing hormone (LH): A hormone made in the pituitary gland. In
women, it triggers ovulation.
Menarche: The onset of menstrual periods, which signals the beginning of a
woman’s reproductive maturation.
Menopause: The technical meaning is the end of menstruation — no menses
for 12 months. Because periods are so irregular in the months leading up to
menopause, the medical community generally doesn’t consider you to be 
officially menopausal until 12 months after your last period. Strictly speaking,
menopause should only refer to the time after periods have stopped, 
but it’s often used loosely to refer to all stages of menopause including 
perimenopause, menopause, and postmenopause.
Menses: This word is derived from the Latin word for month. The term refers
to your period — the periodic flow of blood from the uterus.
Oophorectomy: Surgical removal of one or both ovaries.
Osteoblast: Cells that build new bone.
Osteoclast: Cells that break down bone during the bone-maintenance
process.
Osteopenia: Loss of bone density that isn’t sufficiently severe enough to be
called osteoporosis. If action isn’t taken to better maintain the bone, this
condition will turn into osteoporosis over time.
Osteoporosis: Loss of bone density. Makes bones brittle, porous, and weak.
Ovaries: Female sex organs that store “seeds” (oocytes), some of which
develop into follicles. You’re born with two ovaries. They produce the hor-
mones estrogen and progesterone as well as a small amount of testosterone.
331
Appendix A: Glossary

Ovulation: The process by which the egg is released from the follicle.
Oxidation: Technically, this term refers to the process through which oxygen
combines with another substance — as when metal turns to rust. So what
does this have to do with menopause? Unstable oxygen molecules, free radi-
cals in med speak, are produced as your body’s cells go about their daily
chores. Because they’re unstable, free radicals react with other molecules as
they move through your body. Oxidation does some good things, but it also
damages healthy cells, which can lead to cancer, heart disease, and other ail-
ments common to menopausal women.
Palpitation: In this book, we use this term to refer to a rapid heartbeat.
Pap test: Papanicolaou test. A routine test performed at your annual visit to
the gynecologist, in which a sample of cells is taken from your cervix to
check for abnormal and potentially cancerous cells. Sometimes called a pap
smear.
Perimenopause: Time frame prior to menopause when hormones fluctuate
radically, periods may be irregular, and women may experience physical and
emotional symptoms (such as hot flashes, heart palpitations, mood swings,
irritability, and crying jags). Perimenopause may begin ten years prior to
menopause but more typically begins four to six years prior to menopause
and continues through the first year after menstrual periods stop.
Phytoestrogen: Estrogen produced by plants (such as the soybean plant)
that binds with human estrogen receptors and results in estrogen-like
actions. Sometimes called isoflavone.
POF: See premature ovarian failure.
Polyp: A growth, usually non-cancerous, that protrudes from tissues, usually
in a mucous membrane similar to those in the digestive tract. In this book, we
discuss colon polyps.
Postmenopause: The years after menopause when the ovaries have stopped
functioning. This is the time when health conditions associated with long
periods of low estrogen (osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease) are
your top concern.
Premature menopause: Experiencing menopause at an unusually early age
(such as in your 30s). Premature menopause leaves you at risk of osteoporo-
sis and higher cholesterol fairly early in life.
332
Part VI: Appendixes

Premature ovarian failure (POF): Failure of the ovaries to perform their
normal function, usually because of disease, hormone imbalance, and med-
ical treatments such as radiation or chemotherapy. In some cases of POF, the
cause is never determined.
Premenopausal: Term associated with women who haven’t yet gone through
menopause.
Progesterone: A female hormone produced by the ovaries after ovulation to
prepare the uterus for fertilization.
Progestin: Synthetic form of the natural hormone progesterone.
Progestogen: Any hormone, natural or synthetic, which has the same effect
on the body as progesterone.
Pulmonary embolism: Blockage of an artery in the lungs by a blood clot.
Sequential combination therapy: A type of hormone therapy regimen in
which a woman takes estrogen, followed by progestogen, followed by a
period in which no hormones are taken.
SERMs: Abbreviation for selective estrogen receptor modulators — special
“designer hormones” used in hormone therapy. They can activate estrogen
receptors in some parts of the body while blocking estrogen receptors in
other parts of the body. SERMs are particularly useful for women who want
the benefits of HT but don’t want to increase their risk for breast cancer.
Serotonin: A brain chemical that regulates sleep, mood, libido, pain, and
more.
Surgical menopause: Menopause that is the result of the surgical removal of
the ovaries.
Testosterone: A male hormone produced by the ovaries in low levels. Helps
maintain muscle mass, bone, and libido in women.
Transdermal: A method of delivering medication in which the medication is
absorbed through the skin and goes directly into the bloodstream.
Triglyceride: A chemical form of the fats that circulate in the bloodstream
and are used by the body to make cholesterol.
Unopposed estrogen: A type of hormone therapy regimen in which a woman
uses estrogen without progestogen to balance it.
333
Appendix A: Glossary

Urethra: The little canal through which you urinate.
Urinary-tract infection (UTI): An infection that affects the bladder, urethra,
or kidneys.
Vaginal atrophy: Thinning and drying of vaginal tissue often experienced
during perimenopause and menopause.
Vulva: Collective term for the external genital organs that are visible between
a woman’s thighs consisting of the mons (fleshy, rounded area covered by
pubic hair), labia (lips or folds of the vagina), hymen (thin mucous mem-
brane that keeps the vagina partially closed), clitoris (a woman’s pleasure
spot), and some glands, including those involved in keeping the vaginal area
lubricated.

Resources
I
f you’re interested in finding more information about menopause, hor-
mones, and related conditions, here’s a quick guide to some terrific
resources.
Fabulous Books about Menopause,
Health, Fitness, and Related Issues
These are some of our favorite reference books. They contain some good
information, and the authors wrote them with the layperson in mind. You can
find these books at your local library or bookstore.
Better Than I Ever Expected: Straight Talk about Sex after Sixty, by Joan Price
(Seal Press, 2006). Just as the title promises, Price helps you keep the home
fires burning (even better than before) through perimenopause to
menopause and far, far beyond.
Bob Greene’s Total Body Makeover: An Accelerated Program of Exercise and
Nutrition for Maximum Results in Minimum Time, by Bob Greene (Simon &
Schuster, 2004). What has Oprah got that you haven’t got? Personal trainer
Bob Greene. In this book, Greene offers you a challenging 12-week program of
exercise (be prepared to sweat) and appealing, healthy food. Greene knows
that you don’t live in a vacuum, too — he’ll help you out with the emotional
aspects of neglecting your fitness and nutrition.
Caring for Yourself While Caring for Your Aging Parents, Third Edition: How to
Help, How to Survive, by Claire Berman (Owl Books, 2005). At the same time
that you’re taking care of yourself as you enter menopause, you may still be
taking care of your children. More and more women in the middle of their
lives are also juggling the care of aging parents. If you’re in this group,
Berman’s advice is invaluable, compassionate, wise, and down to earth.

Dr. Susan Love’s Hormone Book: Making Informed Choices, by Susan Love and
Karen Lindsey (Three Rivers Press, 2003). This updated edition of Love’s orig-
inal book on dealing with the symptoms of menopause and taking care of
your health in the years to come presents a balanced approach to
menopause and hormone therapy. 
Healthy Women, Healthy Lives, by Susan E. Hankinson, Graham A. Colditz,
JoAnn E. Manson, and Frank E. Speizer (Simon & Schuster, 2002). With that
many authors, it has to be good. This updated edition of Healthy Women,
Healthy Lives offers important lessons about reducing your risk for many
chronic diseases and several forms of cancer. Using results from one of the
largest studies of women in the world, the Nurses’ Health Study, this resource
can help you make better-informed personal-health choices. It’s informative,
yet very easy to read and understand.
Kathy Smith’s Moving Through Menopause: The Complete Program for Exercise,
Nutrition, and Total Wellness, by Kathy Smith and Robert Miller (Warner,
2002). This one has been out for a few years, but the advice Smith offers is
still right on target for those of us facing what she calls “the half-time bell.”
Although the main focus is on exercise (including yoga and Pilates), Smith
offers her workout advice in the context of taking care of every aspect of
your life.
Menopause and Perimenopause, by Mary Jane Minkin (Yale University Press,
2004). Distilled from years of study, practice, and women out there in the hot
flash zone, Minkin’s book offers clear explanations of what’s causing your
symptoms, how to manage them, and how to take care of your health in the
decades to come.
Menopause Before 40: Coping with Premature Ovarian Failure, by Karin Banerd
(Trafford Publishing, 2004). Although this is a good general reference on
menopause, if you’re going through or have gone through premature
menopause, you’ll find answers to your specific questions about why this is
happening to you, and how you can cope with the rush job your body’s
giving you. Best of all, you get the benefit of the wisdom of other women
who’ve gone through the same thing, and their tips about how best to take
care of yourself in the years to come.
The Okinawa Program: How the World’s Longest-Lived People Achieve
Everlasting Health — And How You Can Too, by Bradley J. Willcox, D. Craig
Willcox, and Makoto Suzuki (Three Rivers Press, 2002). Yeah, okay, this one’s
been around for a while, but that’s because it’s an enduring classic. And,
yeah, it’s a long enduring classic — but there’s gold in them there 496 pages.
Why do those folks on Okinawa live such long, such healthy, such happy
lives? Find out.

What You Wear Can Change Your Life, by Trinny Woodall and Susannah
Constantine (Riverhead Trade, 2005). Menopause changes your body in
almost every aspect. Why shouldn’t your outsides get a makeover, too — one
you can control? BBC Television’s Trinny and Susannah will help the brand
new you to look . . . well, like the brand new you, only with better clothes.
Look better, feel better. 
The Wisdom of Menopause: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and
Healing During the Change, by Christiane Northrup, MD (Bantam Books,
2006). Respected holistic physician Cristiane Northrup lived it before she
wrote it, and emphasizes not only mental and physical health aspects of
menopause, but also the grace and strength to be found in this period of 
your life.
Younger Next Year for Women, by Chris Crowley and Henry S. Lodge (Workman
Publishing, 2005). The same straightforward health and lifestyle information

340
Part VI: Appendixes

Women’s Health Initiative
http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/whi/index.html
http://www.whi.org/index.php 
Consider this listing a two-for-one bonus. The first address is for the main
page of the Women’s Health Initiative. The second is a site that was set up for
participants in the study, but it has some terrific information on the study’s
results that have already been published. Also, the section concerning HRT in
the news is great because it provides links to all the media coverage of the
study’s already-published results concerning hormone therapy.
The Nurses’ Health Study
http://www.channing.harvard.edu/nhs/index.html
Since 1979, the Nurses’ Health Study (and its second stage, named, appropri-
ately enough, the Nurses’ Health Study II) has shed light on what women do
to take care of their health — especially with respect to the use of hormone
therapy — and how it’s working out for them.
Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study
http://www.kronosinstitute.org/keeps.html
This is one to watch — an ongoing study that may provide the answers to
some of our — and your — questions about the effects of hormone therapy
in women at the younger end of the normal perimenopause spectrum, and
about different ways of administering hormones.
The Framingham Heart Study
http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/about/framingham/
The good people of Framingham, Massachusetts, near Boston, have opened
their hearts (and their medical files) for more than half a decade in the ser-
vice of improving the health of people everywhere. Check it out — in addition
to being an important chapter in American medicine, it’s a wonderful human
interest story.
