About the Author
Janine Warner is a best-selling author, professional speaker, and strategic
Internet consultant. Since 1995, she has written ten books about the Internet,
including the best-selling Dreamweaver For Dummies, a guide to Macromedia’s
award-winning Web design program, 50 Fast Dreamweaver Techniques, and
Managing Web Projects For Dummies. 
Janine was inspired to write a book about family Web sites after giving her
sister-in-law a digital camera for Christmas and then helping her learn to use
her computer to make the most of all those digital pictures. In Creating Family
Web Sites For Dummies, Janine combines her personal experience using the
Internet to communicate with family and friends with more than 10 years of
professional experience working on the Internet. She still remembers what it
was like when computers were a mystery to her (they still are sometimes), and
she draws on her background in journalism to serve as a “techy translator.” 
Drawing also on her international experience, Janine uses a broad range of
examples from many countries in this book. Her expertise in multimedia,
technology, and education have taken her on consulting assignments from
Miami to Mexico and on speaking engagements from New York to New Delhi.
She is fluent in Spanish and travels regularly to Spain and Latin America for
consulting projects and speeches.
A recognized Internet expert, Janine has been a featured guest on numerous
radio and television shows, including news programs on ZDTV, ABC, and NBC.
Janine is a former member of the faculty at the University of Southern
California Annenberg and the University of Miami, and she currently serves
as the Multimedia Program Manager for the Western Knight Center, a joint
project of USC and Berkeley that provides specialized training for profes-
sional journalists.
From 1998 to 2000, Janine worked for The Miami Herald, first as their Online
Managing Editor and later as Director of New Media. She also served as
Director of Latin American Operations for CNET Networks, an international
technology media company. 
An award-winning reporter, she earned a degree in Journalism and Spanish
from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and worked for several years
in Northern California as a reporter and editor at Vision Latina Newspaper and
the Pulitzer-Prize-winning Point Reyes Light, and as a freelance writer for more
than a dozen other publications.

Dedication
To all the families and friends who long to be closer, I offer this guide and
encourage you to share your pictures, stories, and dreams. May you always
be surrounded by those you love.
Author’s Acknowledgments
Let me start by thanking my own family for their love, support, and inspiration
to create this book. My sister-in-law Stephanie’s optimism and regular cards
and photos helped me develop the idea for this book, my brother Kevin has
been a solid source of support and guidance over the years, and their three
beautiful daughters are a regular source of joy in my life.
Thanks to all four of my fabulous parents, Malinda, Janice, Helen, and Robin.
Thanks to my brother Brian, my uncle tom and aunt mindy (whose preference
not to use capital letters in their names is just one of their charming quirks),
and all of my extended family.
Thanks to David LaFontaine, the man of my dreams who I look forward to cre-
ating my own family with, and to his sisters, Linda, Beth, and Sarah, for helping
break him in for me. Thanks to his wonderful parents for raising him to be
such a caring and thoughtful man, and to his entire clan for making me feel
like part of the family. David, your patience, support, and inspired sense of
humor are such a gift, especially when I’m up against tough book deadlines. 
Special thanks to the wonderful team that made the production and creation of
this book possible: my agent Margot Maley, Acquisitions Editor Bob Woerner,
and especially Susan Pink, for her extraordinary effort and attention to detail in
editing this book. 
Thanks to Susie Gardner (www.hopstudios.com) for her contributions to the
blogging chapter. I wish you all the best with your own book and highly rec-
ommend Buzz Marketing with Blogs For Dummies.
Special thanks to some of the talented people who helped create the many pho-
tographs, images, and designs featured in this book. Thanks to Photographer
Zach Goldberg, his beautiful wife, and their adorable son Max for sharing their
amazing images. Zach is available for personal and professional photo assign-
ments in LA and will travel by arrangement throughout the U.S. For more
information, visit www.FrozenFoto.com or call 323-662-7751. Thanks also to
photographers Jessica Verma (www.jessicaverma.com) and David LaFontaine
(www.davidlafontaine.com). 

A Spanish gracias to Miguel Calderon and everyone at GrupoW (www.grupow.
com). With more than five years experience creating Web sites, Miguel’s com-
pany has won more Internet awards than any other multimedia agency in
Mexico and has been recognized internationally, especially for its exceptional
design work. As the organizers of the premier conference on Macromedia
Flash in Mexico (www.flashformexico.org), GrupoW specializes in creating
animations, interactive games, and other complex Web projects for clients
around the world.
Over the years, I’ve thanked many people in my books — former teachers,
mentors, and friends — but I have been graced by so many wonderful people
now that no publisher will give me enough pages to thank them all. So let
me conclude by just thanking my lucky stars that this book is finally done.
Complete. Finished. This is it. (And don’t even tell me those aren’t complete
sentences.)

Introduction
W
ant to create a Web site for a wedding, a new baby, or a teenager’s
sporting event? This book is dedicated to helping you build beauti-
fully designed Web pages, as quickly and easily as possible — even if you’re
new to the Internet. The instructions and ideas you find here will help you
harness the power of the Web to share stories, images, and anything else you
can imagine — whether your family and friends live down the street or on the
other side of the world.
About This Book
If your family is like most of the families I know, you don’t have time to wade
through a thick book before you start working on your Web site. That’s why I
wrote Creating Family Web Sites For Dummies in a way that makes it easy for
you to find the answers you need quickly. You don’t have to memorize this
book or even read it in order. Each section is designed to stand alone, giving
you easy answers to particular questions and step-by-step instructions for
specific tasks.
The first part of the book will help you master the basics, from registering a
domain name to taking the red out of someone’s eyes in a photo to creating a
custom Web page. In the second part of the book, project-specific chapters
show you how to use predesigned template pages to develop some of the
most popular family Web sites: baby sites, wedding sites, travel sites, and
hobby sites. The CD that comes with this book has all the templates and
graphics, and each corresponding chapter includes step-by-step instructions
to help you customize the pages and images. If you’re in a rush to get a baby
site or a wedding site up and running, go directly to the specific chapter and
you should find everything you need.
Don’t worry about memorizing the new technical terms you find in this book.
I’ve tried to keep the tech-talk to a minimum, but if you don’t understand a
word, turn to the glossary in the back. Feel free to dog-ear the pages, too — 
I promise they won’t complain!

Conventions Used in This Book
Keeping things consistent makes them easier to understand. In this book,
those consistent elements are conventions. Notice how the word conventions
is in italics? That’s a convention I use frequently. I put new terms in italics
and then define them so that you know what they mean.
Here’s another convention. When I include URLs (Web addresses) or e-mail
addresses in text, they look like this: www.janinewarner.com. When I pre-
sent URLs on their own lines, they look like this:
www.janinewarner.com
I assume that your Web browser, like most, doesn’t require the introductory
http:// for Web addresses. If you use an older browser, remember to type
http:// before the address.
When I introduce you to a set of features, such as options in a dialog box, 
I often set the items apart in a bulleted list. When I want you to follow instruc-
tions, I use numbered steps to walk you through the process.
What You’re Not to Read
You don’t have to read this book cover to cover (and I certainly don’t expect
you to read it on the beach). If you’re in a hurry, go right to the information
you need most and get to work. If you’re new to Web design, skim through
the chapters to get an overview and then go back and read in greater detail
whatever is most relevant to your project. Whether you’re building a simple
site for the first time or working to redesign a more complex site, you find
what you need in these pages.
Foolish Assumptions
Although you may think that you need to be a professional Web designer to
create a beautiful Web site for your family, I don’t. In keeping with the philoso-
phy behind the For Dummies series, this book is an easy-to-use guide designed
for readers with a wide range of experience.

In Chapter 1 you find an introduction to the wide range of options for creat-
ing a Web site, some of which don’t require any special software. But if you
want to get the most out of this book and create your own custom site, you
need a Web design program and an image editor. I use Adobe Photoshop
Elements 3 and Microsoft FrontPage 2003 in the exercises in this book.
How This Book Is Organized
I organized Creating Family Web Sites For Dummies into parts that walk you
through the various steps to creating a Web site — from registering a domain
name to publishing your site on the Internet. I also included a variety of alter-
natives, so you can upload a few pictures to a photo site to get a baby picture
online right away or take more time and create a completely customized Web
site in a program such as FrontPage.
This section provides a breakdown of what you can find in each part so you
can find the information that’s most useful to you. Remember, you can always
start with a simple solution and build a more complex Web site later (like
maybe when your kids are old enough to do it for you.)
Part I: Introducing Family Web Sites
Part I introduces you to the wild world of Web design and the things you
should do to get started creating your own home page on the Internet. In
Chapter 1, I take you on a tour of family Web sites that I think are especially
well designed and organized, using them as examples to help you come up
with ideas for your own Web project. Chapter 1 also features an overview of
the many different ways you can build a Web site, from free photo album sites
that make it easy to get pictures online fast to comparisons of online design
services and software programs you can use to create your own completely
customized Web site.
In Chapter 2, it’s time to get organized and gather the elements you’ll want to
include on your Web site, sketch the structure and navigation for your site,
and develop a simple project plan to keep you on track. Chapter 3 shows you
how to search for and register a domain name, and includes a few tips about
what to do if your first choice is already taken. Chapter 4 explains how Web
servers work and how to choose the best service provider to host your site.
You even find out about a few places where you can host a Web site for free.

Introduction

Part II: Lookin’ Good: Images and Design
The best way to make your Web site shine is to fill it with gorgeous images —
and then make sure they don’t take too long to download. This part is all about
finding great images, making them look their best, and optimizing them for
the Internet. In Chapter 5, you discover where to find clip art and royalty-free
photographs you can use to add color and a more professional look to your
pages. You also find instructions for downloading images from the Web, tips
for scanning images and artwork, and information on retrieving photos from
a digital camera. In Chapter 6, you get an introduction to Adobe Photoshop
Elements, an image editor designed to be easy enough for beginners, yet pow-
erful enough to create great images for the Web. In Chapter 7, you discover
the timesaving tools in Photoshop Elements that can help you organize your
images and automate the process of creating photo albums and Web galleries.
Part III: Creating Web Pages and 
Adding Multimedia
In Part III you find out how to build Web pages, work with templates, and
bring your site to life with multimedia. Chapter 8 introduces you to Microsoft
FrontPage, with instructions for creating and editing pages, setting links, and
publishing your site on the Internet. In Chapter 9, you see how templates
work and how to use them to simplify page creation and to develop a consis-
tent look for your site. And in Chapter 10, you discover the sites and sounds
of multimedia with an overview of the many options for adding audio, video,
and animation to your Web pages.
Part IV: Creating Special Project Sites
In Part IV, you find a range of project-specific chapters for creating —right
away — some of the most popular family Web sites. Chapters 11 through 14
feature specially designed templates and graphics included on the CD with
this book — simply follow the step-by-step instructions in each chapter and
you can customize your own sites from these predesigned pages and images.
Chapter 11 starts you off with a baby Web site and tips for getting photos of a
newborn online fast. Chapter 12 covers the steps for creating a wedding site,
from the invitation, to directions to the reception, to a photo album of your
best wedding photographs. You even find tips about using online gift reg-
istries and including links to your favorite online stores. In Chapter 13, you
4
Creating Family Web Sites For Dummies 

discover the modern answer to family vacation slide shows: a Web site that
showcases your travel pictures. In Chapter 14, you find out to create sites to
show off your favorite activities, such as hobbies, clubs, and sports teams.
Chapter 15 introduces you to one of the fastest growing trends on the
Internet — blogging. Also known as Web logs, blogs are sophisticated online
journals your entire family can use to post regular messages and stories on
your family Web site.
Part V: The Part of Tens
The Part of Tens is a quick reference. In Chapter 16, you discover ten family-
oriented Web sites featuring educational and entertaining destinations for the
whole clan. Chapter 17 lists ten important rules for designing Web pages, and
Chapter 18 completes the book with ten ways to test, update, and promote
your Web site.
Part VI: Appendixes
Appendix A features online calendar services you can link to your Web site
or use as stand-alone solutions to keep your family organized and on time.
You also find great resources for researching your family history, exploring
genealogy, and creating a family tree. Appendix B is a glossary of the terms
you need to know when working on the Web — and then some!
And finally, Appendix C is a guide to the CD-ROM and the great templates,
images, and software that accompany this book.

 Comparing different types of Web sites
 Getting ideas from great examples
 Choosing the best tools for the job
A
s photo albums turn digital and e-mail addresses become common-
place, modern families are building their own Web sites, contributing to
an increasingly popular part of the Internet where you can find everything
from elaborate wedding invitations to vacation pictures to the first photo of
a newborn.
You don’t need advanced computer skills anymore to create a family Web
site. Today, sharing photos online is as easy as pressing the Enter key to
upload images to a photo site. And you can create a wedding or baby site by
simply filling out a form. Even if you want to create a customized Web site,
the software programs and resources available now make it easier than ever
to personalize the way you share family stories and memories over the
Internet.
In this chapter, I introduce you to the many ways you can build a Web site
so you can better appreciate your options and decide which method is best
for you. Then I take you on a tour of family Web sites so you can see what’s
possible. Finally I compare the most popular Web design and image editing
programs so you can find the best tools for your project.
Connecting Families Over the Web
My goal in this book is not just to help families create Web sites but to help
people around the world get closer by sharing their stories and photos with
loved ones over the Internet. Here are a few ways people like you are using
the Internet to keep in touch:

10
Part I: Introducing Family Web Sites 
 Baby sites: Many parents are using Web sites and blogs (online journals)
to chronicle every milestone of their child’s life, from the first tooth to
the first day of school. Chapter 11 features templates and tips for creat-
ing a baby Web site, and Chapter 15 covers blogs, which are becoming
increasingly popular on the Web.
 Sites for younger kids: Better than a bumper sticker, Web sites are a
great way to showcase your favorite student’s work, clubs, after-school
activities, hobbies, and more. Chapter 14 features templates and instruc-
tions for creating a sports or hobby Web site.
 Sites for older kids: Tech-savvy high-school kids are showing off with
graduation sites, prom sites, and team sites. Creating a Web site is like
having your own yearbook, only better. If you want to create your own
completely customized site, see the introduction to FrontPage 2003 in
Chapter 8.
 Travel sites: The days of vacation slide shows in the living room are
fading fast. Today, families are creating vacation sites with online photo
albums to share snapshots from their latest adventures. Chapter 13 pro-
vides examples and templates.
 Wedding sites: Before they say ‘I do,’ more and more couples are building
wedding Web sites that feature invitations, directions, guest registries,
and more. Chapter 12 provides templates and instructions for creating a
wedding site.
If you’re anxious to put up a Web site right away, skip ahead to one of the
chapters listed in the preceding list. You find everything you need to get a
site up quickly. If you have a little more time to think about your project or
you want to create a more general family site, continue reading this chapter
to discover more about the range of options for creating a Web site.
Comparing Web Site Options
If you’ve never created a Web site before, you may not realize how many
ways you can publish photos and other information on the Web, or how
many software programs and service providers there are to choose from.
You’ve probably seen Web sites in many styles, but you may not know that
some of the differences in how those sites look depends on the type of tech-
nology used to create them.
Choosing how to create a Web site is an important first step. You can start
simply, with an online photo album site or with an online service that does
nearly everything for you. Or you can create a site based on templates, like
the ones featured on the CD for Chapters 11 through 14, or you can create a
completely customized Web site. This section provides a brief review of your
options.

11
Chapter 1: Touring Family Web Sites
Different types of sites
Here’s a brief list of some of the different kinds of Web sites you can create
and the technical options that go with them:
 Online photo album sites: Even if you plan to create a more complex Web
site later, you may want to set up an online photo album site because it’s
one of the fastest and easiest ways to put photos online. Best of all, these
photo sites are free, and they don’t bombard your pages with lots of adver-
tising like the free Web site services at Geocities or Tripod. Photo album
sites make their money by charging for prints, which they are happy to
send to you or your loved ones for about 20 or 30 cents each. The most
popular free online photo album sites, including Ofoto.com, shown in
Figure 1-1, are featured in the “Photo album and printing services” sidebar.
Photo album and printing services
If you’re looking for an easy way to share
photos online, but you still think it’s nice to have
a physical, tangible photo printed on paper, you
may be happy to discover the services listed in
this sidebar, which provide both free online
photo album services and an easy way for 
you — or anyone else with access to your photo
album — to order prints.
To create a photo album, you just upload your
images; they become instantly available on the
Web to anyone with your user ID and password.
(Passwords are required to ensure privacy so
you can restrict who views your personal
images.) You don’t even have to optimize your
images (optimizing involves reducing the file
size of images so they download faster), so you
won’t need an image program such as
Photoshop. Indeed, sites such as Ofoto and
Shutterfly encourage you to upload high-reso-
lution images because the better the resolution,
the better the print quality.
The following sites offer online photo album and
printing services:
 Ofoto (www.ofoto.com): Kodak’s online
photo site makes it easy to upload images
for free and share your photo album with
friends and family. Like other photo sites,
Ofoto makes money by charging for prints.
At 29 cents per print, Ofoto is not the
cheapest, but they boast that the archival
quality of their pictures means they’ll last as
long as conventional film prints. The site
offers basic image editing and cropping
tools and enables you or anyone with
access to your site to create and order
printed calendars and photo books from
your pictures.
 Shutterfly 
(www.shutterfly.com):
Shutterfly offers simple editing tools,
enables you to post and share photos for
free, and sells printing services. Shutterfly
has an intuitive interface, and their special-
ized printing options enable you to turn your
pictures into greeting cards, bound photo
albums, personalized calendars, coffee
mugs, T-shirts, or tote bags. Prints at
Shutterfly cost 29 cents each.
 Yahoo Photos (photos.yahoo.com)
offers online photo album services similar
to Ofoto and Shutterfly, but their digital
prints are priced at only 19 cents each.

12
Part I: Introducing Family Web Sites 
 Free online services: If price is your biggest concern and you want to
create a Web site, you may be pleased to find that several companies will
let you publish your site for free. The catch is that these companies then
sell advertising on your pages, and you have no control over what ads will
run next to your words and pictures. Yahoo! features a free Web site cre-
ation tool at Geocities.com, and you’ll find similar solutions at Angel
fire.com and Tripod.com. All three enable you to create template-based
sites or to upload your own pages to their system (although they offer
limited space and visits to your site). You find more about these and
other Web server options in Chapter 4.
 Specialty Web-based solutions: The easiest way to create a professional-
looking Web site for your family is to use an online service, such as
family.myevent.com, as shown in Figure 1-2. You’ll find similar ser-
vices at www.eweddings.com and www.babyjellybeans.com, but I
chose to feature family.myevent.com because I think it’s one of the
best in terms of price and ease of use and because you can create a vari-
ety of Web sites in one place (for weddings, babies, bar mitzvahs, or any
other event). The family.myevent.com site offers a complete package
of features, including planning tools, maps, and hotel reservation sys-
tems. Simply choose the template you want for your design, fill in a few
forms, and upload your photos. You can create and publish a complete
Web site in a matter of minutes.

13
Chapter 1: Touring Family Web Sites
 Blogging software: Millions of people now have blogs, or online jour-
nals, on the Internet. Their popularity has spawned a variety of software
programs designed to facilitate easy updates, such as Blogging.com, as
shown in Figure 1-3. A blog may be your best option if you want to make
frequent updates to your Web site. One of the more famous family blogs
is The Trixie Update, which Trixie’s stay-at-home dad updates many
times a day to keep her mom informed while she’s at work. That site and
many other blogging sites are featured in Chapter 15.
 Predesigned templates: I included with this book a collection of tem-
plates to make it easy for you to create a variety of common Web sites,
such as a wedding site and a baby site. To use these templates, you need
a Web design program, such as Microsoft FrontPage 2003, and an image
program, such as Adobe Photoshop Elements 3. Although you have to
know the basics of these programs to create a template-based site, the
process is still much easier than creating a site from scratch. You also
have more design control than you do if you use templates at an online
service such as Tripod, where you can change only the content. When
you edit templates in a program such as FrontPage 2003, you have the
option of altering the design as much or as little as you choose. Many
Web design programs include templates you can use, and you can buy
or download free templates from a variety of Web sites. To use the tem-
plates included on the CD, check out Chapters 11 through 14.
Figure 1-2:

this one

expertise.

14
Part I: Introducing Family Web Sites 
 Fully customized sites: If you use a program such as Macromedia
Dreamweaver MX 2004 (which is what I used to create my own Web site,
featured in Figure 1-4) or Microsoft FrontPage 2003 (featured in this
book), you can create a fully customized Web site. You’ll need more
technical expertise to create a customized Web site than you need to
use one of the template options, but you’ll have the greatest design con-
trol over your pages. Even if you start by using a template to create your
site, you can always go back later and further customize your pages in
one of these programs. However, just mastering the technical features 
of a Web design program doesn’t make you a great designer. Templates
can help you avoid common design mistakes and create a professional-
looking site, even if you can’t draw a stick figure. (To find out more
about design, check out the design tips in Chapter 17.)
 Database-driven sites: The most sophisticated Web sites on the Internet,
such as the online store at Amazon.com or the news site at CNN.com, were
created by using complex programming and databases. Combining a
database that records information about users with the ability to gener-
ate pages automatically is what enables Amazon to greet you by name
when you return to their site, track your orders as you buy books, and
even make recommendations based on your previous purchases. I defi-
nitely don’t suggest that you begin with a custom database. You don’t
need anything this sophisticated anyway, unless you want to sell lots of
products or publish dozens of articles and photos to your site every day.
Figure 1-3:

Web site,

regular
updates or

online
journal.

Recommendations
The type of Web site you create depends on your budget, your expertise, and
your time. If cost is your biggest concern and you don’t mind sharing your
pages with advertisers, try Angelfire.com or Geocities.com, but be aware
that you’ll have limited design options and no control over the ads that appear
on your pages.
If your goal is to get a feature-rich site online as quickly and easily as possi-
ble, I recommend family.myevent.com. For a nominal fee, you can choose
from a variety of high-quality site designs, add sophisticated features such
as an online calendar, and use their simple system to publish your site in a
matter of minutes or hours, even if you have no technical expertise. You do
the development online, filling out a series of forms with the text you want on
your site and then uploading your photos through a system that’s similar to
attaching a photo to an e-mail message.
If you use a service like family.myevent.com, you don’t need any software,
unless you want to edit your images before you post them to your site. (You
find instructions for resizing, cropping, and editing images in Chapter 6.)

Chapter 1: Touring Family Web Sites

16
Part I: Introducing Family Web Sites 
If you want more control over your site and no ads, a Web site built with the
templates included in this book and hosted on a commercial service provider
is a great option. With just a little knowledge of a program such as FrontPage
2003 (covered in Chapters 8 and 9), you can customize predesigned Web
page templates. The beauty of creating your own site design with a program
like FrontPage is that you can add as much text and as many images as you
want, and you can change the design as much or as little as your talent and
time allow.
When you use a program such as FrontPage (whether you use templates or
not), you create and edit your Web pages on your own computer and then
transfer them to the server when you’re ready to publish your site to the
Web. The transfer process is easy and the benefit of building the site on your
computer first is that you can test your work and experiment with different
options before you publish your site on the server and make it available on
the Internet.
No matter what option you choose, you can register your own domain name
and point it to your Web site. This means you can direct people to your own
special Web address, such as www.the-smith-family.com, whether you
host your site at AngelFire.com, at family.myevent.com, or on your own
server. You find out how to register a domain name in Chapter 3 and how to
choose the best service provider in Chapter 4.
Protecting your privacy
Many parents wonder whether it is safe to put
their children’s photos on the Web; others
simply don’t want to share their stories with the
world for fear that they may attract unwanted
attention. Although there have been some
highly publicized cases of children running into
trouble because of someone they met online,
such incidents are rare. I consider a child’s
photo appearing on a Web page to be roughly
equivalent to his or her image appearing in a
school yearbook or in a sports team photo in a
local newspaper.
Millions of families have created Web sites and
enjoy sharing their photos and stories. Rather
than expressing concern about making their
stories and photos public on the Web, many
families report that they have made new friends
and reconnected with old ones thanks to their
Web sites.
Here are some other things you can do to pro-
tect your personal information:
 Don’t include your home address or phone
number on your Web site.
 Don’t include your work address or phone
number.
 Be careful when writing about the times
when you won’t be at home, such as the
dates you’ll be on vacation.

Chapter 1: Touring Family Web Sites
Best Practices and Models
A great Web site combines beautiful images and well-written text in a design
that makes it easy to find your way to the most important information. But if
you’re staring at a blank computer screen, creating a Web site can seem
daunting. To help inspire you, this section presents a few well-designed or
innovative Web sites. So sit back, relax, and get your browser ready to go for
a ride — after reading the descriptions of these sites, you may want to see
them for yourself.
Wedding sites that inspire
When Jonathon and Joanne decided to get married on a Caribbean island,
they knew that creating a Web site would make it easier to coordinate the
travel arrangements and accommodations for their guests. On the site,
shown in Figure 1-5, they posted helpful information, such as the “Things to
Bring” section, which includes passports, suntan lotion, and snorkel gear. If
you visit the site at wedding.studio2f.com, you’ll find many wonderful sto-
ries about how they met, as well as regular updates for friends and family
who couldn’t travel to attend the wedding.
Figure 1-5:
This site
combines a
simple,
elegant
design with
valuable
information,
such as all
the special
things
guests
should 
pack for a
wedding on
a tropical
island.

Jonathon and Joanne’s Web site was created using blogging software, which
makes it easy to add updates (even from a tropical island). You find more
information about blogs in Chapter 15. In Chapter 12, you find instructions
for creating a customized wedding site using the templates provided on the CD.
Studying other people’s wedding sites is a great way to see what you can do
with your own site. You’ll find many more wedding sites online at
www.topweddingsites.com/
Baby sites to make you smile
The MoriCentral.com Web site, shown in Figure 1-6, features photos and
stories from everyone in the Mori family, but there’s no question that the chil-
dren are the stars of the show. In addition to a photo gallery and guest book,
the Moris have included a section called Jared’s Anecdotes filled with fun sto-
ries about their son. Visit the site to see a great example of a clean, simple
design, with lots of great photos and clever stories about the kids.

Part I: Introducing Family Web Sites 

Family sites for everyone
Martin and Emiko created a Web site (www.martin-emiko.net) to help keep
their distant families informed about their lives and growing family. He’s from
Switzerland and she’s from Japan, so they are always far away from someone
in the family. In addition to a great collection of stories and photos, the use of
a long image across the top of each page, shown in Figure 1-7, is a simple but
dramatic design trick and an ideal way to showcase the many landscapes
they’ve photographed in their travels.
Here are a few other family Web sites you may want to visit for ideas:
 The Demar Family Web site at members.cox.net/botiff features an
animation on the front page that includes a recording of the voices of
some family members. The combination of the mother’s voice welcom-
ing you to the site and the kids making snide comments in the back-
ground as she talks provides a humorous introduction that draws you
into the site and gives you a good idea about what to expect when you
get there.

Part I: Introducing Family Web Sites 
 The Miller Family Web site at www.millfam.org boasts several sophisti-
cated features, put together by using a combination of services. Check
out the bulletin board for neighborhood and family events, and visit
their content-managed site, as they call it, to see a family blog linked to a
custom family Web site. (You find out more about blogs in Chapter 15
and more about calendars in Appendix A).
 The Bratz family Web site, at webpages.charter.net/bratz, features
a fall sports schedule with a full calendar of games and other sporting
events of interest to family and friends.
 Vicki and Tony’s Web site at www.geocities.com/vickips/ is an exam-
ple of how much you can do with a good sense of humor, even on a free
Web site like Geocities.
Travel sites around the world
The Mansz and McKerral family Web site at www.mansz.com, shown in 
Figure 1-8, is more than just a place to share photos of friends and family.
They’ve created a site that’s a showcase of bird photos from their travels and
a great resource for other birders. Whatever your hobby or passion, a family

Tribute sites to make you proud
Creating a Web site for friends or family members is a beautiful way to pre-
serve their memory and pay tribute to their life. Figure 1-9 features a simple
Web page that my Uncle Tom created for my grandmother, Carol McCain. We
all have fond memories of grandma’s house on the lake, where I learned to
water ski and enjoyed sitting on the long deck staring out at the water and
waiting for a chance to wave at the Dixie boat.
Choosing Tools
All Web pages are simply text pages that can be opened in any editor capable
of reading text, such as Microsoft Word or even Notepad. I’ve chosen to
use FrontPage 2003 and Photoshop Elements 3 in this book because they’re
relatively easy to use and reasonably priced, yet powerful enough to create
complex Web sites. I recommend that you start with these programs if you’re
new to Web design. You can always move on to more advanced programs if
you decide you want more features and options.

A note of caution, however. It’s easy to get dazzled by all the effects, filters
and tools. Don’t fall into the trap of using filters and other fancy features just
because you can. (“Look Ma, I made my photo look like a watercolor! Now it
looks like a Japanese print! Wait, let me try Fresco.”) Keep in mind that the
most important thing is to make your photos and Web pages look good and
download quickly on the Internet.
My goal in this section is to help you understand the strengths and weaknesses
of the most popular Web design programs so you can find the program that’s
best for you now and in the future.
Comparing image editing programs
You’ll find many choices in the world of image editing programs, from high-
end programs such as Adobe Photoshop (which retails for about $650) to
simple programs that you can download for free over the Internet. Here’s a
quick comparison of some of the most popular image editing programs.
 Adobe Photoshop CL: By far the most popular image editing program in
the history of computer design, Photoshop CL is a powerful program
that lets you create, edit, and manipulate images. This is a professional
tool, with a professional price tag (about $650), so unless you have a
huge budget or you’re a serious photographer or designer, it’s probably
not the right choice for you.
 Adobe Photoshop Elements 3: Shown in Figure 1-10, Photoshop
Elements 3, which now comes bundled with the creation tools from
Photoshop Album, features many of the same powerful tools as
Photoshop CL but is easier to use and costs about $100. Elements pro-
vides more than enough power for almost anything you’d need to do on
a family Web site. That’s why I’ve chosen Photoshop Elements 3 as the
image editing tool for this book. You find instructions for how to use
Elements in Chapters 5, 6, and 7.
The difference between the two versions of Photoshop boils down to this:
The expensive version is used by people like magazine editors and high-
fashion photographers to do painstaking, exacting work on their photos,
to make a flawless image suitable for viewing by millions and optimized
for print. Given enough time, you can use Photoshop to make a mule look
like a supermodel. For the rest of us, who just want to edit photos, or
maybe make it look like Uncle Ernie’s basset hound was driving the lawn-
mower, Photoshop Elements 3 should be all you’ll ever need.
 Macromedia Fireworks MX 2004: This image design program has many
special features that make it easy to create images that download
quickly and look good on the Web. A few years ago, Fireworks was the

23
Chapter 1: Touring Family Web Sites
best image program for the Web, but that’s no longer true due to
enhancements to Photoshop Elements and other programs in this list.
Today, the main reason for choosing Fireworks is if you use Dream-
weaver as your Web design program, because the two programs are 
fully integrated.
 Corel Draw Graphics Suite 12: Although not as popular as Adobe
Photoshop, CorelDraw is a professional-grade image program that is rich
in features. This suite of programs costs less than Adobe Photoshop but
more than Elements.
 Ulead PhotoImpact XL: This image editing program often comes bun-
dled with the software for digital cameras and scanners. It’s easy to use
and has a wide range of features, including several automated correction
features. The ExpressFix Photo Wizard, for example, helps correct for
common photography mistakes such as red eye and lens distortion.
You’ll also get everything you need to edit and convert images for the
Web — and at a lower price than Adobe’s or Corel’s products.
 Apple iPhoto: Often bundled with Apple computers as part of the iLife
suite, iPhoto is an excellent image editor and by far the best choice for
Mac users. (You can’t get this program for a PC.) If you have iPhoto, you
have everything you need to create images for the Web.

Comparing Web design programs
In the early days of the Web, people were using lots of different visual HTML
editors. Today, only a few major ones are left: Microsoft FrontPage, Adobe
GoLive, and Macromedia Dreamweaver:
 Microsoft FrontPage 2003: I chose to use FrontPage 2003 in this book
because it is less expensive than its competitors and relatively easy to
use. It’s also the most popular Web design program among consumers
(although Dreamweaver wins among professional designers). If you work
with other Microsoft Office programs, you should feel comfortable with
FrontPage because it’s similar to Microsoft Word and is integrated into
Microsoft Office. You find a basic guide to FrontPage in Chapter 8 and a
special guide to working with templates in FrontPage in Chapter 9. For
more about FrontPage, visit www.frontpage.com, as shown in Figure 1-11.
 Macromedia Dreamweaver MX 2004: By far the most popular choice
among professional Web designers, Dreamweaver has received great
reviews and attracted considerable attention because it offers high-end
Web design features and lots of control for programmers who like to
work in the code behind their Web pages. Dreamweaver features many
customizable palettes and floating dialog boxes, which makes it look
more like an image editor than a word processor. If you’re serious about
Web design, this is the tool to use. If you’re still new to the Web, you’ll
save money and probably have an easier time with a program such as
FrontPage. For more about Dreamweaver, visit www.dreamweaver.com,
shown in Figure 1-12, or buy my book, Dreamweaver MX 2004 For
Dummies (published by Wiley).
If you want to use the templates provided on the CD, but prefer to use
Dreamweaver to do your Web design, visit www.digitalfamily.com.
You’ll find a special bonus for readers of this book — instructions for
using Dreamweaver to create the template sites featured in Chapters 11
through 14.
 Macromedia Contribute 3.0: This program is reasonably priced and
easy to use, but it’s not a stand-alone program. Instead, it works with
Dreamweaver. Contribute can be used to edit a Web site created in
Dreamweaver, which makes it easy for anyone to update pages, but
you’ll need a pro to create the site in Dreamweaver first. Contribute is an
ideal choice if you’re hiring a Web designer to create your site or if one
member of the family is an experienced designer who wants to use
Dreamweaver.
 Adobe GoLive CS: Similar in features to Dreamweaver MX 2004, GoLive
CS is used by many professional Web designers, especially those who
are loyal to Adobe and are already using Photoshop CS. GoLive CS is a
professional design tool and not generally recommended for beginners
or hobbyists.

No matter what software programs you choose for image editing and Web
design, the basic concepts are the same. If you’re new to Web design, I recom-
mend that you start with FrontPage 2003 and Elements. However, don’t forget
that you can use whatever image or Web design program you prefer with this
book, and you can always move on to more advanced programs later if you
decide you want more features and options.

 Keeping track of the bigger picture

 Updating and revising your site
B
efore you dive into building your first Web site, do yourself a favor and
save your family some grief by spending a little time thinking through
what you want to put on your site, how you plan to build your site, and how
you will add new pages, images, and other content in the future. Then spend
some time thinking about how you’re going to organize the links on your site
so visitors can find what they’re looking for on your pages. If you don’t, you
may get an e-mail message from someone like Uncle Alf or Cousin Squeegee
when he can’t find the pictures of Bobbie Junior’s latest Little League game.
One of my favorite sayings is, “Learn from other people’s mistakes; you won’t
live long enough to make them all yourself.” My goal in this chapter is to
share some of the best tricks and techniques the experts have learned the
hard way — so you can spend more time on the fun stuff, such as creating
graphics and cool page designs.
Determining What You Want 
on Your Site
When creating a family Web site, one of the first things you may want to do is
hold a brainstorming session with the people who will be working on, and
appearing in, your site. The purpose of this initial meeting is to think of the
stories, images, and other features you may want to include on the Web site,
such as photos (old and new), lists of favorite books, awards and schedules of
team events, descriptions of other activities, and favorite family anecdotes.

28
Part I: Introducing Family Web Sites 
Writing it down
To tell the best story with your Web site, some-
one in the family has to do some writing. Many
people find this a daunting task, so here are a
few tips:
 Write about what interests you. If you’re
not interested in what you’re writing, why
should you assume anyone else will be?
Step away from overused introductions and
clichés and look for creative verbs, colorful
adjectives, and unusual ways to tell a 
story. Instead of starting a biography with
“Jessica was born on July 25,” consider
writing something like, “It was so hot 
the day Jessica was born, grandma still
remembers the chocolate cigars melting all
over the sheets in the guest room.”
 Interview family members to get the best
stories and details. Don’t trust your memory
to get the facts right. Grab a notebook or a
tape recorder and interview each family
member to collect the best stories and the
intimate details that bring a biography to
life.
 Write in a conversational tone. Many
people are more formal and serious when
writing than they would ever be when talk-
ing. The result is often stiff and dull writing.
To avoid this trap, try writing your Web site
text as if you were writing a letter to a
favorite aunt or telling a story to a friend.
 Write one thing at a time. Trying to write too
much at one time is a quick way to discover
writer’s block. Instead of sitting down to
write all the text for your Web site, focus on
one section or one family member’s biogra-
phy. Then move on to the next writing
assignment.
 Determine who, what, where, when, and
how. These provocative little words provide
a powerful tool for making sure you’ve 
covered the key points in a story. If you’re
stuck, ask yourself each of these questions.
As you review your writing, make sure
you’ve answered them all.
 Read other Web sites for ideas. Still not
sure what to say on your Web site?
Consider reading what other families have
said on their sites. Many great family Web
sites are featured in Chapters 1 and 16.
 Write a first draft. Don’t expect your writing
to be perfect the first time you sit down to
put pen to paper or fingers to a keyboard. If
you do, you’ll probably have a hard time get-
ting anything on the blank page. Most pro-
fessional writers revise their work over and
over again and then have someone else edit
and revise it again.
 Less is more. When revising and editing, cut
out unnecessary words. Trying to fill space
is a bad habit some of us learned when we
had to write a ten-page paper in high
school. It takes more time to write con-
cisely, but a story that is told well in few
words has more effect than one that drags
on and on and on.
 Make sure the text is readable on your
Web pages. When you lay out the text, don’t
use a type size that’s too small or distract-
ing background patterns. Make sure the
color of the text contrasts well against the
background.
 Find an editor. Every writer needs an editor.
Before you let your words go on a live site,
ask someone who has a good eye for detail
to look over your work. And don’t get defen-
sive if the person suggests ways to improve
your work. Constructive criticism is not per-
sonal; it’s about getting the best story on the
page.

A good brainstorming session is a nonjudgmental free-for-all — a chance for
everyone involved to make suggestions without worrying about whether
anyone will like their ideas. If you stifle someone’s creativity early in the
process, that person may feel less inclined to voice other ideas in the future.
And you never know when a seemingly crazy idea will lead to a great one.
You should end the session with a long “wish list.” Your next challenge is to
pare that list down to what’s most important, and create a plan for putting all
the items on the list online.
Here’s an example of a slimmed-down wish list:
 Photos of each member of the family
 A picture of our house
 A welcome letter for the front page of the site
 A picture from mom and dad’s wedding
 Baby pictures of Joanne and Tim
 Excerpts from the baby books
 School pictures of Joanne and Tim
 A picture of Joanne in karate class
 A picture of Tim playing baseball
 Stories from Tim and Joanne about school and sports activities
 A family history page with genealogy information
 Pictures of grandma and grandpa
 Links to favorite Web sites
While you’re considering the possibilities for what you want to include in
your Web site, you may also want to go through the questions in the planning
guide that follows to help decide how you want to build, host, and design
your site.
Whether you are working alone or have a team of family members involved,
the following guidelines are designed to help you sort through some of the
most common questions you’ll have to answer as you start working on your
site:
 What do you want to accomplish with your Web site? It’s easy to get
distracted by all the things you could do with your site. This first ques-
tion is designed to help you clarify what’s most important to you. For
example, is your main goal to share photos with distant family mem-
bers? Or do you want to communicate better within your immediate
family? After you define your goals, use them to guide the rest of your
decisions and keep you on track.
29
Chapter 2: Getting Organized

If you find that you want to accomplish many goals with your site, try to
prioritize them so you have a sense of what’s most important to you as
you start building your site.
 Who will work on your site? If you will be sharing the project, consider
breaking up the Web site development into different tasks, such as build-
ing the site, writing the text for each page, and designing the look of the
site. Think about the interests and skills of each family member and
assign different tasks accordingly.
 What software will you need? I chose FrontPage 2003 as the primary
Web design program covered in this book because it’s the most common
program used by consumers, but you may prefer a more sophisticated
program, such as Macromedia Dreamweaver MX 2004. You find an
overview of software options and online services in Chapter 1.
 Do you want to include multimedia files, such as video or audio?
Although editing multimedia files is more complex than creating Web
pages, adding digitized video and audio to a Web page is relatively easy.
If you want to add clips from your family movies but no one in your
family is an expert in video, consider having a local video lab digitize
the video for you. Look for video services in the phone book, in a local
Internet directory, or by using a search engine such as Google, which
features the ability to search for businesses in a local area.
 Do you want interactive features, such as a calendar or gift registry?
Creating your own interactive calendar requires more sophisticated pro-
gramming skills than creating a simple Web page with text and pictures,
unless you use an online service, such as the one at calendar.yahoo.
com. Gift registries are great features for baby and wedding sites. You
find instructions for creating pages that feature gift sites in Chapters 11
and 12.
 Do you want to register a domain name, such as www.smithfamily.
com, for your site? It’s a good idea to register a domain name early
because it can take at least a few days for the registration process to be
completed. (You’ll find information on searching for and registering a
domain name in Chapter 3.)
 Do you want to pay for a commercial service provider or use a free
hosting service? Commercial service providers cost as little as $5 a
month, making them a more viable option than ever before. If you
choose to use a free hosting service, such as the ones at www.tripod.
com or www.geocities.com, you’ll save some money but your design
options and the size of your site will be limited. (See Chapter 4 for more
information on hosting options.)

Part I: Introducing Family Web Sites 

Site Development Overview
In a nutshell, building a Web site involves creating a home page (often called
the front page) that links to other pages representing different sections of the
site. Those pages, in turn, can link to subsections that can then lead to addi-
tional subsections.
Two big parts of Web site planning are
 Determining how to divide your site into sections
 Determining how pages link to one another
If you’re new to Web design, you may think that you don’t need to worry
about how to manage updates and additions to your Web site. But all good
Web sites grow (or they grow stale), and the bigger they get, the harder they
are to manage. Planning how you will link new sections of your Web site now
can make a tremendous difference later.
It’s even more important to create a structure and plan for your site if more than
one person is working on the site (perhaps each child in the family is building
his or her own section). Without organization and a few conventions for
naming files and creating new links, confusion may rule in your virtual world.
Creating a preliminary map of your site can help you plan and manage the
site’s development. To create a diagram that represents the pages on your
site, you can sit down with a piece of paper and a pen, use a program
designed for developing flowcharts, such as MacFlo or Visio, or use a word-
processing or graphics program. I like to draw boxes to represent pages and
use arrows to show how one page will link to another.
Paper sticky notes are also great tool for Web site planning because you can
move them around. Each sticky note can represent a page or a section of
your site. As you’re planning the structure and flow of the site, rearrange the
sticky notes to accommodate new ideas. You may want to use string to show
how the pages will be linked.
Try grouping pictures and other content that you want on your site into sec-
tions. For example, you might create a section about your kids and include
their baby pictures as well as more recent photos. Or you might take those
same pictures and group them in separate sections to create a Web page for
each sibling.
Refer to the Web site wish list described earlier in this chapter to make sure you
remember all the things you wanted on the site when you first started planning.
31
Chapter 2: Getting Organized

Navigating and linking
As you start planning the organization of the pages and links on your Web
site, consider these questions. When site visitors arrive at your home page,
where do you want them to go? How will they move around your site? How
will they find the information that is important to them?
A good way to help answer these questions is to imagine that you are a typical
user of your site. For example, you might say to yourself, “If I were grandma
and I came to the site looking for Susan’s new school photo, what would
make it easy for me to find it?”
In a well-designed Web site, users navigate easily and intuitively from one
page to another and can make a beeline to the information most relevant to
them, such as the freshly posted photos of a newborn. Figure 2-1 is a sample
structure for a family Web site.

32
Part I: Introducing Family Web Sites 

As you plan the navigation of your site, make sure that visitors can do the 
following:
 Follow different paths to the same important information. It may seem
repetitive at first, but providing more than one link to the same page
makes it easier for visitors to find their way around your site. For exam-
ple, if you have a family history section, you may want to link to that
page from many other pages in your site, such as the page about your
daughter’s wedding as well as the page about your grandparents.
 Move back and forth between pages and sections. Links that help
users move forward and backward through a site can be especially
useful. In a slide show or image gallery, navigational arrows that link
from one page to the next make viewing a series of photos a breeze.
 Return to main pages and subsections in one step. To make it easy to
jump to the main pages and sections of your site, provide a menu of
links on every page. Most big Web sites feature this kind of navigational
element, often called a menu bar. When links to key pages appear on
every page on the site, visitors don’t have to retrace their steps back to
the home page. Here’s an example of a menu bar you might create with a
row of links to the main sections of a family site:
Home Page ~ Dad ~ Mom ~ Mikayla ~ Savannah ~ Jessica
Following the rules for file names
When you’re building a Web site, you have to follow stricter rules for naming
the Web pages, images, and multimedia files in your site than you do on a
Macintosh or PC computer. That’s because most Web servers run on the Unix
operating system, which can’t support the kinds of complex file names you
can use on a Mac or PC computer.
When you create HTML pages, images, or other files for your Web site, you
can’t use any spaces or special characters, such as apostrophes or asterisks,
in the file names. You can, however, use hyphens and underscores (the
underline character above the hyphen on your keyboard). Web designers
routinely use hyphens and underscores in place of spaces. For example, you
can’t name an image dumb picture of Sue.jpeg or Sue’s picture.jpeg,
but you can name it dumb-picture-of-Sue.jpeg or picture_of_Sue.jpeg.
Being thoughtful about how you name the pages on your site can help you
keep track of the content. For example, suppose that your Web site includes
a section for your annual New Year’s family letter. Simple names such as
family-letter.html may make sense to you when you first start. But what
do you name the file next year and the year after that, when you add more
family letters?
33
Chapter 2: Getting Organized

The simple solution is to add dates to the end of file names. For example, a
good file name for the yearly letter is family_letter_date.htm, where
date is the four-digit year. The first year’s letter might be family_letter_
2005.htm, and the next year’s would be family_letter_2006.htm.
Adding dates to image files is even more important because you typically
have many photos from the same event or of the same person. Therefore,
you may want to be even more specific when naming image files, for example,
Susan-swimming-06-05-2005. For special events, such as a birthday, you
may want to create a separate folder with a name like susan-birthday-05,
and then save all the images inside that folder so you don’t have to add a
date to each image file.
If more than one person is working on your Web site, come up with a naming
system that makes sense to everyone involved. Doing so will make keeping
track of pages and images easier.
Understanding file name extensions
All files in a Web site need to include what’s called an extension, usually a
three- or four-character identifier tacked to the end of the file name and 
preceded by a period. The extension is used to identify the type of file. For
example, a file name followed by .html or .htm was created by using HTML
(HyperText Markup Language), which is the programming language used to
create Web pages.
Although most Web servers support both .htm and .html file extensions in
file names, some service provides require that you use the longer .html
extension, especially for the main page of your site, which should be named
index.html. This can lead to problems because most Web design programs,
such as Microsoft FrontPage, automatically name the main page of your site
index.htm. If you have trouble viewing the page when you transfer your site
to your server, the problem may be that the file needs to be renamed index.
34
Part I: Introducing Family Web Sites 
Under construction? No hard hats here!
Good Web sites are always under construc-
tion. Don’t greet your visitors with an “Under
Construction” placeholder, which seems to say,
“You clicked this link for no good reason. Come
back another day, and maybe we’ll have some-
thing for you to see.” Instead, let visitors know
that new treats are coming by putting notices
on pages that already have content. A message
like “Come here next Thursday for a link to
something even cooler” is a great idea. Never
make users click a link and wait for a page to
load, only to find that nothing but a person with
a hard hat is waiting for them.

html. I’ve never found a server that doesn’t support the longer .html
version, so I’ve used that naming convention throughout this book.
FrontPage makes it easy to rename your files with the .html extension with-
out risking broken links. (See Chapter 8 for more information about working
with FrontPage.) If you’re not sure what is required on your Web server,
check with your service provider.
If you’re not used to seeing something like .html, .gif, or .jpeg at the end
of a file name, that’s because most Windows computers hide this last part of
a file name to make names appear simpler for users. Macintosh computers
don’t require extensions, so you won’t see them on a Mac unless you add
them yourself. Table 2-1 provides a list of common file extensions.
Table 2-1
Common Extensions for Web Site Content

.pdf
A popular option for long documents or pages that have
complex formatting on the Web
.rm, .qt, and .wmv
Used for three of the most popular video formats; these and
other multimedia extensions are covered in Chapter 10.
Programs such as FrontPage 2003 and Photoshop Elements 3, which I use 
in later chapters, take care of putting the proper extensions on your files 
for you. If you stick with these programs, you shouldn’t have to worry 
about extensions. Make sure, however, that you never delete a file name’s
extension.
If you’re having trouble opening a file, a missing extension may be the prob-
lem. This is a common occurrence when someone on a Mac e-mails a file to
someone on a PC (because extensions are not used on the Mac). Because the
PC system requires extensions to identify file types and to determine what
program to use to open the file, you may need to manually add the extension
before you can open the file on a PC. (For details on this task, see the next
section.) For example, if someone on a Mac sends you a digital photo and you
35
Chapter 2: Getting Organized

can’t open it on your PC, adding .jpeg to the end of the file name may solve
the problem. If you use a Mac, you can avoid this problem by adding the
appropriate extension to your files before you send them to a PC.
Adding a file name extension
To add an extension to a file name, simply select the file name as you 
would select any file name to rename it, and add a period followed by the
appropriate extension to the end of the name. For example, a GIF image
called silly-kitty should be renamed to silly-kitty.gif before it is
linked to your Web pages. Make sure you don’t add a space between the
name and the extension.
The easiest way to rename a file on a Windows computer is to place your
cursor directly over the name and right-click. Select Rename from the list that
appears, click to place your cursor at the end of the existing file name, and
then type a period and the extension.
On a Macintosh computer, click once on the file name to select it, and then
click to place your cursor at the end of the existing file name and type the
period followed by the extension.
Viewing file extensions under Windows
Many Windows computers come preset not to display file name extensions.
That means you won’t see extensions, such as .gif or .doc, at the end of a
file name. The extensions may still there; they’re just not visible.
If you’re creating all the files for your Web site on a Windows computer
with programs such as FrontPage and Photoshop, you shouldn’t have to
worry about extensions and your best option may be to leave them hidden.
However, if you receive files from someone who uses a Macintosh or you’re
having trouble with links that don’t work or images or other files that can’t
be displayed on your computer, missing extensions may be the problem.
Before you can add or change an extension, you have to be able to see it. To
make extensions visible on a PC, simply change your folder preferences as
follows:
1. Double-click any folder name to open that folder on your hard drive.
The folder opens and the files in the folder become visible.
2. Choose Tools➪Folder Options from the top of the folder window.
The Folder Options dialog box appears.
3. Click the View tab.
4. Scroll down to the Hidden files and folders section, as shown in
Figure 2-2.

5. Make sure that the Hide Extensions for Known File Types option is
turned off.
If the option has a check mark, click to remove it.
6. Click the Apply Changes to All Folders button, at the top of the 
dialog box.
If you click OK at the bottom of the dialog box, you apply these changes
only to the folder you are viewing. You may consider this option if you
want to make the extensions visible in the folder where you have your
Web site pages but don’t want visible extensions in any other folders on
your computer.
If you find that any of your files are missing extensions, see the earlier section
titled “Adding a file name extension.”
Viewing file extensions on a Mac
Macintosh computers don’t use file extensions to identify file types the way
Windows computers do. If you use a Mac you may need to add file extensions
for your Web pages, images, and any other content you want on your Web site.
Some software programs, such as FrontPage, add file extensions automatically,
even when you create files on a Mac. Other programs, such as Photoshop, don’t
add extensions automatically, so you’ll need to add them manually as you
name your files. (For a list of common extensions, refer to Table 2-1.) Macs
don’t hide extensions, so after you add one to the end of a file it should be
visible immediately.

Chapter 2: Getting Organized

Setting Deadlines for Finishing 
Your Web Site
It’s easy to have big ideas and think of all the ways you can create a cool Web
site for your family. But when you get down to the task of developing the pages,
you may find that accomplishing everything is not as easy as you thought it
would be. One problem I’ve seen with personal projects, such as family Web
sites, is that they aren’t managed as formally as you might manage a business
project and the people working on them are almost never given deadlines
The first challenge is setting realistic deadlines. The second is making every-
one involved believe that the deadlines are important. If you want to set
deadlines that family members will stick to, plan the launch of your Web site
around a special date. For example, plan to get your new family Web site
online to show grandma when she comes to visit in August, or to surprise
mom on her birthday, or before the first day back to school. Use a date that’s
special to you or your family and one that will help keep everyone motivated.
The Never-Ending Project
One of the best and worst things about building a Web site is that there is no
clear beginning, middle, or end to the task. You can always add more pages,
pictures, and links, and you can never do enough testing.
Don’t underestimate the importance of checking your Web site regularly to
make sure it has no broken links or missing images. If you’re building the site
by yourself, ask someone else to check over your work and test it, especially
after you’ve published it to the live server. If you have a team of people work-
ing on your family Web site, you may want to assign them to check each
other’s work regularly.
And remember, you don’t have to do put everything on your Web site all at
once. The best model is to start small and keep it simple until you see how
much your family will use your site and what features they consider most
important. You can always add old family photos or create a new section for
a hobby or a special event later. The best family Web sites are much like the
families who build them: They grow and develop and continue for genera-
tions to come.

Registering Your Site’s 
Domain Name
In This Chapter
 Searching for names to see whether they’re already taken
 Registering a domain name
 Understanding domain name options
 Creating e-mail addresses
T
he address for your Web site is called its domain name. It’s what visitors
need to know to find your Web site. For example, Walt Disney’s Web site
has the domain name www.disney.com.
Even before you start building your Web site, I recommend that you register
your own domain name. The process is simple, painless, and costs less than
$10 per year. (You find detailed information about the best places to register
your domain name later in this chapter.)
I registered my own name, www.JanineWarner.com, years ago, but I didn’t
think of registering a domain name for my entire family until recently. And
because we have a common name, I was too late to get www.warner.com. In
this chapter, you see how I found a name for my family Web site even though
my first choice was already taken. You also find step-by-step instructions for
searching for and registering your own domain name.
Finding and Registering a Name
If you don’t register a domain name, your Web site’s address will be an 
extension of the domain that your service provider registered and will
look something like this:
www.serviceprovider.com/users/yournamehere

If you register a domain name, you can point the name wherever your Web
site is hosted, and your address should look more like this:
www.yourfamilyname.com
(For information about choosing a service provider to host your Web site,
see Chapter 4.)
Your domain name is your calling card — it should be short and sweet, and
easy to say and write. If your Web address is too long or complex, it will be
hard for family members to remember or type on a keyboard.
Searching for a new name
You can register any domain name that hasn’t already been taken by some-
one else. To check to see whether a domain name is already registered, do a
simple search at any domain registration Web site, such as www.godaddy.
com, as shown in Figure 3-1.

Part I: Introducing Family Web Sites 

Finding out whether a name is already in use is easy — and free. In the early
days of the Web, you could register domain names only at www.network
solutions.com, but the service is now available through hundreds of sites.
These services connect to the same master databases that track all the domain
names on the Web, but they charge different amounts for domain registration.
Many of these services also offer Web site hosting (covered in detail in Chap-
ter 4), e-mail, and more. If you do a Web search on domain registration, you’ll
find thousands of matches. My favorite domain registration service for price
and options has been www.godaddy.com, which boasts that it has registered
more domains in the last few years than any other company. I also recommend
www.1and1.com, an international company that offers competitive domain reg-
istration services and claims to be the largest Web hosting service in the world.
Unfortunately, common domain names were taken long ago. But even if your
first choice for a domain name is unavailable, don’t give up. With a little trial
and error, you’re likely to find a variation that will work fine. (You’ll find sug-
gestions for finding a domain name in the “Naming tips” section that follows.)
To search for and register a domain name for your family, follow these steps:
1. Use a Web browser to visit a domain name registrar.
As mentioned, I recommend www.godaddy.com.
2. In the search area on the registrar’s site, type the name you want to
register.
In Figure 3-1, I’m searching for warnerfamily.
3. Click to begin your search.
The results of your search are displayed. (If you use godaddy.com, for
example, you would click the Go button.) My results are shown in 
Figure 3-2.
4. If the name you want is not available and you don’t like the alterna-
tives offered, try another name.
Most registration services provide a list of recommended alternatives if the
name you want is taken. If you still need a little help, read on.
If you register a domain name at www.godaddy.com, you’ll be offered many
additional products and services during the registration process. I don’t like
this aggressive sales technique, which makes you scroll through pages of
product offers before you can complete your registration, but I do like the
low prices at Go Daddy and their excellent, 24-hour customer support. So let
me just reassure you that you don’t need any additional products or services,
such as Web hosting and Spam blocking software, to register a domain name.
You can simply skip through these product pages by clicking “no thanks”
until you get to the final checkout page to complete your registration.

Chapter 3: Registering Your Site’s Domain Name

Naming tips
Don’t get frustrated if you find that your family name is already taken. You
can almost always find a variation on your name that will serve you well. Try
one of the following tricks:
 Add a word or phrase that indicates geographic location, for example,
www.michiganwarners.com or www.thecanadasmiths.com.
 Sometimes a different but equally appropriate name can work. For exam-
ple, my Uncle David’s family has always been referred to as The David’s
because there were too many McCains (my mother’s last name) to refer
to everyone by their last name. A good name for my uncle’s Web site
would be www.thedavids.com
 Try something playful, such as the www.funfrinkles.com or www.
lovinggibsons.com.
 Although you may use a hyphen or an underscore in your name, the
best choice is a word or a combination of words run together. For exam-
ple, you could register www.the-sunshine-family.com, but that’s
harder to convey verbally because you have to explain the hyphens. If
you simply use www.sunshinefamily.com, you can say, “My address is
SunshineFamily dot com, all one word.”

42
Part I: Introducing Family Web Sites 

 The best domain names are easy to remember, easy to convey (can be
said in one simple sentence), and easy to spell.
 Don’t choose a name that’s too close to someone else’s if they have a
site you’d be embarrassed to be associated with. (Always check the site
of the name you want before you choose a close variation.)
I searched for www.warnerfamily.com, www.thewarners.com, and
www.thewarnerfamily.com, but none were available. At that point, I was
thinking about how our Warner family deserved to be able to use our own
name — and sure enough, www.ourwarnerfamily.com was still available.
With a little persistence, I’m sure you’ll find the right domain name for your
family, too.
Naming rules
As you consider what you want to use for a domain name, remember the 
following rules. Note that these rules are based on technology requirements
and laws, so there aren’t any good ways to get around them:
 Make sure your domain name doesn’t violate a trademark. (You can do a
simple trademark search at www.uspto.gov. If you’re starting a busi-
ness or concerned about violating someone’s trademark, consult an
attorney.)
 The only punctuation allowed is the hyphen and the underscore — no
spaces, periods, apostrophes, or other punctuation.
 Domain names are not case sensitive. For example, you can get to my
Web site by entering www.janinewarner.com or www.JanineWarner.
com. Because people are accustomed to seeing capital letters in a person’s
name, I often capitalize the J and W when I type my domain name.
 Anything that comes after a domain name (after the dot-com part of the
address) is case sensitive. For example, www.JanineWarner.com/books
takes you directly to the page on my site where I list my books. You can’t
get there if you capitalize the B in books.
Buying a name from someone else
Buying and selling domain names has become big business in a world where
your name is your front door, your street address, and much of your identity.
Web businesses dedicated solely to the sale of domain names have sprung up
around the world.
43
Chapter 3: Registering Your Site’s Domain Name

I’ve heard a few sensational stories about domain names being sold for exor-
bitant prices. However, for the most part, many names and variations on
names are still available for the registration price, so few people offer huge
amounts of money for a domain name anymore, even if it’s a great one. If you
have your heart set on a name and find that it’s already taken, contact the
owner and try negotiating.
You can find out to whom a domain name is registered by going to
www.NetworkSolutions.com
and clicking the WHOIS Lookup button at the top of the home page. The reg-
istration listing includes the street address and e-mail address of the person
who registered the domain name, as well as information about the server or
service provider that hosts the domain.
Searching the WhoIs database at Network Solutions is free, but if you want to
register a domain name, I suggest you use a lower-priced registration service.
Network Solutions was once the only place to register domain names and
remains one of the most expensive ones.
If you want to keep your own name and address out of the domain database
at WhoIs, use the Private Domain Registration option, available exclusively at
www.godaddy.com. It costs $9 per year in addition to the $8 registration fee,
but it will keep your personal information out of the public database.
Disputing a domain name
Almost as soon as it became possible to register domain names, people
started fighting over who had the right to own their name.com. Recognizing
a potential bonanza, many early Web users registered dozens of names they
thought they might be able to sell later. Country names, product names, and
44
Part I: Introducing Family Web Sites 
Your virtual image
I tell my friends that they should register their
own names as domain names because I con-
sider that an important way to protect what I
call your virtual image. I registered www.
JanineWarner.com years ago and I use it as
a place to showcase everything I want the
world to know about my books, speaking
engagements, and more. A personal Web site
serves as a great way to promote yourself,
whether you are job hunting, developing a con-
sulting business, or simply want to share your
story with the world. After you’ve registered 
a domain name for your family, consider regis-
tering names for each member of the family
individually.

many common terms (such as www.toothpaste.com) were snatched up
early. Not surprisingly, ownership of some of those names came into dispute
when a company that thought it had a legal right to the name tried to take it
from the person who registered it.
45
Chapter 3: Registering Your Site’s Domain Name
Registering multiple domain names
Excerpted from Janine’s Business Technology
column, originally published in The Miami Herald
Can anyone find your Web site?
I am amazed when I type a business name into
a browser and don’t find the site I’m looking for.
I must confess, sometimes it’s because I’ve
typed it wrong, or assumed they were using
their full name when they were using some
alternative. I eventually find what I’m looking for,
but don’t count on all your visitors to be as per-
sistent as I am.
A shortened version of your business name may
seem like a better domain name because it
requires less typing, but if your customers know
you by your full name, they may be confused.
For example, the official site for American
Airlines is www.aa.com, but they’ve been
smart enough to register more than one name,
so if you type in www.americanairlines.
com, you go to the same site.
My best advice: Register every variation and
misspelling of your name you can think of and
direct those domain names to your Web site.
(Just because some people didn’t do well in the
third-grade spelling bee doesn’t mean they
don’t have money to buy your products or ser-
vices online.)
Directing more than one domain name to the
same Web site is a relatively simple technical
detail you can arrange through your Internet
service provider or the company where you reg-
ister the name. And it’s not that expensive.
Some of the new registration sites, such as
godaddy.com, charge as little as $8 per year.
(You’ll pay $29 at www.register.com and $16
at www.buydomains.com.)
Also consider registering the same name with
different domain endings, such as .org, .net
and, most importantly, .com. The Seattle Ballet,
for example, registered seattleballet.org
(the domain ending used by most nonprofits),
but they should also consider registering
seattleballet.com because many people
will assume that’s the address.
Consider whitehouse.gov. The .gov at the
end of that name distinguishes it as an official
government site. You can’t register a .gov site
as an individual, but anyone can register .com
(which stands for commercial) and .org (which
stands for organization).
I don’t recommend visiting the .com version of
Whitehouse. It’s a hard-core porn site, and pro-
vides a dramatic lesson in the importance of
protecting your domain name. I’m sure that site
receives many visits from unsuspecting people
who type .com instead of .gov. The .org ver-
sion of Whitehouse isn’t an official government
site either, although it does at least have a pic-
ture of the White House. It also has lots of criti-
cal commentary on the U.S. government.
The moral here is that if you are a nonprofit, a
government organization, or a university (usu-
ally distinguished by .edu), you should also
register your name.com, just to make sure
that people don’t end up at a site that’s trying to
get traffic from your name recognition.
Similarly, if the .com version of a name you
want is unavailable, registering the .net,
.biz, or .info versions may be a fine alter-
native. But make sure that the site that has the
.com version is not a direct competitor or
something you’d be embarrassed by if your vis-
itors found it by accident.

The courts seem to be applying the same laws to domain names that they
apply to trademarks. For example, if you have a legal trademark such as Levi
and someone registers www.levi.com before you do, you can probably go to
court and force the person to give you the domain name. If you don’t have a
trademark, you may have no other alternative than to try and buy it from the
person or choose an alternative.
Even if you have a strong case, domain name disputes can be lengthy and
expensive. In many cases, you’re better off avoiding names that may be
deemed suspect by large, established companies. If your last name is Disney,
you may have a strong case for registering www.disney.com (if it were still
available), but you still might lose in court and would undoubtedly run out
of money before Disney Enterprises, Inc. would in the legal battle.
If you think you have a case against someone who has taken your name, don’t
bother Godaddy or Network Solutions with your complaint. They don’t handle
domain name disputes; they just register names on a first-come, first-served
basis. Instead, talk to the guilty party directly. If that doesn’t work, take it
court. If you can get a judge to rule that you’re right, the domain registration
service will revoke the name and let you have it.
Understanding Domain Name Endings
When you search for a domain name, you need to determine not only the first
part of the name but also the ending. Table 3-1 provides a list of common
domain name endings, their purposes, and any restrictions.

The .com domain has emerged as the most valuable because it is the best
recognized and the one people are most likely to remember. However, all
these domains work the same way in terms of directing users to a Web site
address. For example, www.smith.com, www.smith.net, and www.smith.
org work the same way on the Internet.
Country domains
Nearly every country in the world now has its own domain. Country domains
include domains such as .am for Armenia, .br for Brazil, .uk for the United
Kingdom, .sa for Saudi Arabia, and .zw for Zimbabwe.
What about .tv and .ws?
A few foreign country codes have become popular in the United States
because they represent common acronyms, such as .tv, which many
assume stands for television but is really the domain for the county of
Tuvalu. Similarly, .ws is assumed to mean Web site (and is even listed that
way on some registrar sites), but it is the country code for Western Samoa.
You can register a name with the .ws or .tv domain even if you don’t live in
one of those countries, but these domain codes are not as common as the
ones listed in Table 3-1.
47
Chapter 3: Registering Your Site’s Domain Name

Although you can register a domain name with a country code from any-
where in the world, it’s generally more expensive to register a country
domain. The price ranges from $10 to $80 per year, depending on the price
set by the particular country.
Creating E-mail Addresses for the Family
After you’ve registered a family domain name, you can set up e-mail addresses
at that domain. (See Figure 3-3.) For example, if you register www.moscowitz.
com, you can then set up an e-mail address such as frank@moscowitz.com or
a more general address such as family@moscowitz.com. Most domain regis-
trars also offer e-mail services for as little as $10 per year.
If you’re hosting your Web site by using a different company from the one
you used to register your domain name, you may prefer to set up an e-mail
address at the Web hosting company. There is no right or wrong choice in
this matter. Make your decision based on which service you find easiest to
use, most reliable, or most cost effective.

 Comparing free hosting sites
I
f you’ve ever heard the phrase, “Wherever you go, there you are,” you may
appreciate how the Internet works. There is no one “there” in the Internet,
no master computer that holds all the information in the world. Instead, you
find innumerable “theres,” each represented by a computer connected to
another computer to make up a network, which is connected to other net-
works connected to networks of networks. Essentially, the Internet is a bunch
of computers and wires strung together all across the globe.
When you visit a Web site, you are essentially viewing pages stored on another
computer’s hard drive, and it generally doesn’t matter if that computer is across
the office or thousands of miles away. What does matter is what kind of com-
puter it is, what software it uses, and how it’s connected to the Internet. In this
chapter, you discover how Web servers work, why you need one to host your
Web site, and how to choose one that best fits your needs and your budget.
Understanding Web Servers
A Web server is a computer with a permanent connection to the Internet and
special software that enables it to communicate with Web browsers, such as
Internet Explorer or Netscape. As a general rule, you create a Web site on your
computer’s hard drive, using a program such as FrontPage or Dreamweaver,
and then transfer the completed site to a server when you’re ready to publish
your site on the Internet.

50
Part I: Introducing Family Web Sites 
Most Web servers are connected through special high-speed Internet lines
with odd names such as T1 and T3. These lines afford greater bandwidth, so
they can transport more information more quickly (much faster than a cable
modem or a DSL line).
Bandwidth measures the carrying capacity of a connection on the Internet.
Compare it to a garden hose and its capacity to transport water. The larger
the diameter of the hose, the more water it can carry. Bandwidth works the
same way: The greater the bandwidth, the faster the transmission of informa-
tion. On the Internet, information is digital data, measured in kilobytes and
megabytes (the same way it’s measured on your hard drive). The larger the
file, the more bandwidth is required to transport the file across the Internet.
For example, most short text files (1 to 20 pages) are only a few kilobytes in
size so they take only a few seconds to send, even over a 56K modem (the
equivalent of a garden hose in this analogy). Sending the entire manuscript
of, say, War and Peace will take a little longer. But the kinds of files that take
the most bandwidth — the ones that warrant a fire hose, or a high-speed 
connection such as a cable modem or a DSL line — are video and animation
files, PowerPoint presentations, and large color images, which can be many
megabytes in size.
Plain old telephone service
Many different kinds of phone lines exist. Most
homes have a basic phone line, a twisted
copper wire the phone company still calls
POTS, or plain old telephone service (yes, that’s
really what they call it). Many homes and 
businesses have upgraded to DSL (Digital
Subscriber Line), which supports multiple
phone lines and provides higher bandwidth and
better signal quality than a POTS line. For a
higher price, some businesses get T1 lines,
which are high-speed, dedicated connections
that transmit digital signals at 1.544 megabits
per second and can handle many phone lines
and Internet connections at a time. At the top of
the heap, a T3 line transmits digital data at
44.746 megabits per second (trust me, that’s
really fast).
To help you compare the differences in band-
width, visualize them as if they were running
water:
56K modem — garden hose
DSL or cable modem — fire hose
T1 line — small waterfall
T3 line — Niagara falls
Most Internet service providers use T1 or T3
lines, which afford them a permanent connec-
tion to the Internet with lots of bandwidth that
they then split up among customers. A single T1
line is the equivalent of about 24 phone lines.
The bandwidth that you can transfer across
such a line can be divided and shared among
many users. Thus, when you pay an ISP for a
connection to the Internet, you’re paying for a
small portion of the high-speed line that the ISP
shares among many users.

51
Chapter 4: Choosing a Web Hosting Service Provider
A number of companies, such as Microsoft and Netscape, make software for
Web servers as well as the browsers used to look at the pages they serve.
Each system has its own features and limitations, but all of them do essen-
tially the same thing: serve files from a Web site to its visiting audience.
Web servers use the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to deliver Hypertext
Markup Language (HTML) and other files to a client, usually a browser. At the
low end, a Web server can be set up on almost any desktop computer with a
connection to the Internet. If you use a 56K modem, the connection is slow,
but setting up a Web server at the low end doesn’t cost much, as long as you
have the technical expertise — and you need a lot of that to run a Web
server. At the high end of the Web server spectrum, a powerful computer
with a fast and dedicated Internet connection and the staff to keep every-
thing working costs many thousands of dollars.
Some servers are designed to handle only one Web site; others handle many
sites simultaneously. Universities, government organizations, and private
companies generally operate the latter. Internet service providers usually
have one or more large servers capable of hosting 100 or more Web sites on
each server. When you set up your site with an ISP, you essentially rent a
small section of the hard drive on one of their servers. ISPs can section off a
server and provide you with access to only the part of the server that you’re
using to manage your Web site, even though many other Web sites may be
hosted on the same computer.
Many people who are setting up Web sites for the first time think that they
need to run their own Web servers to put their sites on the Internet. Let me
reassure you that you don’t have to run a server to publish a Web site. This is
a good thing because maintaining a server can be complicated and expen-
sive, requiring skills that are quite different than the ones you need to
develop Web pages. Unless you’re building a large and complex Web site, set-
ting up your own server is not necessary — and definitely not recommended!
Let the ISPs take care of that part and dedicate your time and resources to
building a great Web site for your family.
Choosing a Service Provider
So you’ve established that you definitely don’t want to run your own server.
Now, how do you find an Internet service provider? And what exactly does a
service provider do?
Internet service providers sell accounts that let you connect to the Internet,
host a Web site on their server, or both. To log onto the Internet to check
e-mail or to surf the Web, you want a user account, a service provided by your
ISP (unless you log on through a university, a large company, or another pri-
vate service). To build a Web site, you want a Web hosting account, which is

52
Part I: Introducing Family Web Sites 
usually sold separately from a user account. For example, you may like using
AOL as your service provider to log onto the Internet but choose a company
such as XO, shown in Figure 4-1, for Web hosting.
Although you don’t have to use the same service to host your Web site that
you use to access the Internet, sticking with the same company may be a
good choice if you’re happy with your user account and like the customer
service your provider offers. Most ISPs, such as XO, lease Web space to cus-
tomers and can set up an account for you in a few days.
If cost is your biggest concern, you may want to select one of the free Web
hosting options featured later in this chapter in the “Comparing Free Hosting
Services” section.
The big-ticket items at ISPs are bandwidth, disk space, and security. Bandwidth
gets expensive if lots of people visit your site, because more visitors mean
more use of the connection.
The bigger your site — the more images and especially the more sound files,
video, and animation files you include — the more you’ll pay for the disk
space to host it. Because video files are much larger than images or text files,
video takes up much more hard drive space and requires more bandwidth to
be viewed. As a result, providing many hours of video on your site can be
expensive. Most people limit their sites to a few short video clips (30 seconds
to a few minutes each) to save on hosting expenses.

Chapter 4: Choosing a Web Hosting Service Provider
Some Web hosting packages include secure e-commerce capabilities and
sophisticated programming options. Unless you’re planning to create a com-
mercial site (maybe a family business?) or to put large amounts of video or
sound files on your site, you’ll probably do fine with the simplest or lowest-
level Web hosting package your service provider offers.
Shop around; many service providers offer basic Web hosting services for $5
to $10 per month. Some services also offer discounts if you pay for a year in
advance.
Finding an Internet service provider
The best place to look for an ISP is also the most obvious: Look online! Also,
ask around and get references from people you trust.
If you want to find a server anywhere in the world, The Directory (www.
thedirectory.org) claims to list more Internet service providers and bul-
letin board services than any other such registry in the world. The main page
of the site may not look like much, but it’s been around for almost ten years
and boasts a comprehensive list of service providers.
If you use the Web design program FrontPage 2003, which is featured in this
book, you may want a service provider that supports FrontPage extensions,
which are advanced features included in the program that require special
support on the server. Microsoft’s Web site at www.frontpage2003.com
includes a list of companies that provide FrontPage hosting.
Asking the right questions
Running a Web server is an increasingly competitive business, and not all
companies offer the same features. Before you select an ISP, consider what
you want on your Web site and make sure that you find a service that meets
your needs. The goal is to find the provider with the best collection of ser-
vices within your budget. Here are a few questions you may want to ask when
considering which service provider to use to host your Web site.
How much do you charge?
Choosing an ISP is a little like choosing a cellphone company or a long- 
distance service. In theory, all phone companies provide the same ability
to make a phone call, but as you’ve probably discovered, they offer a wide
variety of rate plans and special services.

My best advice is to get a good start on the development plan for your site so
that you know what kinds of services you’ll need before you shop around for
a service provider. (You can find more information about planning a Web 
project in Chapter 2.) You may decide, for example, that you want 24-hour
technical support so you can get help at night after work, but you don’t want
to pay extra for secure financial transactions because you don’t plan to sell
products online.
Two of the biggest factors in cost are how much hard drive space you need
and whether you want a secure server. As a general rule, the more server
space you need, the more you pay. Most family sites shouldn’t need more
server space than is included with most basic plans, which range from about
50MB to 500MB. In a world where new computers often come with 100GB
hard drives, you may think that 50MB of space doesn’t sound like much. But
remember that, on the Web, you want your files to be small so that they load
as quickly as possible. A site with a few hundred pages and graphics may be
less than 10MB if the images are optimized and you don’t include multimedia,
such as video and audio files which take up much more hard drive space
than text and image files).
It’s a good idea to make sure your service provider will let you add more
space if you need it. However, you can always move to another server if you
need to. And if you register a domain name (covered in Chapter 3), you can
redirect your domain to the new server and your URL never has to change.
In addition to the cost of server space, most ISPs charge a fee based on how
much bandwidth you use (measured by the amount of traffic on your site).
This fee is like paying rent based on the number of people who walk through
your door. Most Web sites created by families don’t get enough traffic to
worry about added bandwidth costs, and the standard amount included in
your basic plan should be plenty. But be aware that many service providers
do charge for excessive bandwidth use, so you may see additional bandwidth
as an option among their offerings.
Do you provide e-commerce services?
Most Web server accounts that support secure e-commerce transactions,
such as Storefront.net shown in Figure 4-2, charge extra for the service. If
you’re thinking of starting a family business, you may want to make sure your
service provider can handle e-commerce transactions. If you plan to sell a
lot of products, I also recommend a shopping cart system, a program that
enables visitors to add products to a checkout page that tracks and tallies
selected items as a visitor moves through your site. (You can buy shopping
cart systems separately, but many service providers include these programs
as an added feature.)
54
Part I: Introducing Family Web Sites 

Do you provide security?
Security is a complicated issue on the Web, but mostly it deals with encryp-
tion, a process of encoding and decoding messages so that they’re harder to
intercept by people who might want to steal confidential information, such as
credit card numbers. A secure server is called secure because the data being
transmitted between the browser and the server is encrypted. No system is
100 percent secure, but as a general rule, the stronger the encryption, the
more it costs. If you’re trying to keep credit card numbers private, you may
be willing to pay a premium for security, but if you’re creating a family Web
site, you probably don’t need to pay extra for a secure server.
Do you provide technical support?
Because each service provider is different, you can’t find everything you
need to know about your server in this, or any other, book. If you run into
trouble uploading or maintaining your site, you need to contact your hosting
company to find out more about the specifics of connecting to their Web
server. If you want to use more advanced services, such as an e-commerce
system, you’re even more likely to need their help. The bottom line: Technical
support is important, and it’s always a good idea to make sure you can get
help when you need it.

Chapter 4: Choosing a Web Hosting Service Provider

56
Part I: Introducing Family Web Sites 
Some ISPs have knowledgeable technical support staff on call 24 hours a day;
others may never answer the phone (especially those with the lowest rates).
Before you even sign up for service, call the tech support line of the service
providers you’re considering to see how long it takes each one to respond to
your initial questions. If you have trouble finding out how to buy an ISP’s ser-
vices, you’ll probably have even more trouble getting help after the ISP has
your money.
Most ISPs post FAQs (frequently asked questions) on their Web sites. FAQs
can be a great place to get answers to common questions and to find out
about common problems other users are having — before you even sign up.
Expect your ISP to give you basic assistance, such as helping you understand
the specific aspects of how to log on to their server and upload your pages.
However, few ISPs provide help with actual Web design and development, so
don’t judge them badly if they won’t give you advice about the design or
graphics for your site.
What kind of backup systems do you have in place?
Backup systems are crucial on the Internet — technical problems are
common, servers go down, and the contents of a Web server can be lost if its
not backed up regularly. Any reputable service provider should have a regu-
lar backup system in place. If they balk when you ask about their backup
system, they’re probably not reliable or well run.
Protecting yourself with clever passwords
An extraordinary number of people use the
same word for their user ID and password. That
may seem like a good idea because using the
same word makes your password easier to
remember, but it’s also the easiest password for
someone to guess if they find your user ID.
Other common passwords are the name of your
pet, your spouse’s name, or a birthdate. Those
are fine options if you’re not too worried about
security, but if you want to make it harder for
someone to break into your computer system,
use more than just a name or a common word.
Adding punctuation and mixing the case in your
password makes it much harder to guess, but
not necessarily harder to remember if you’re
clever. For example, if your dog is named Spot
and you live at 44 Maple, you can add the
number to your dog’s name to create a great
password such as spot44. The goal is to come
up with a password that is easy for you to
remember, but hard for someone else to guess,
even if they use a software program designed
to try random names as passwords.
Mix numbers and words together, and you make
it much harder for anyone to break into your
computer system. Add a random capital letter,
and you make it even harder. Oh, and don’t leave
your password on a sticky note next to your
computer, unless you want anyone who walks
into your home or office to have access to your
system.

57
Chapter 4: Choosing a Web Hosting Service Provider
Always keep a backup of your Web site on your own computer. You’re proba-
bly doing this already if you created the site on your hard drive, but it’s a
good idea to keep an extra copy of the site on a disk or a CD. If you use con-
sultants to do any of the work for you, get copies of their work. Similarly, if
other members of your family are working on the site, make sure you collect
their work in one place and keep it backed up.
Where are you located?
When you look for a Web hosting service, keep in mind that it doesn’t need to
be in your geographic location. You can send files anywhere on the Internet,
so your Web site can be almost anywhere. If you’re in a small town or an iso-
lated area where few companies provide Web hosting, you may want to look
beyond your neighborhood to find a better deal. For example, I live in Los
Angeles, but I use Internet hosting services in Michigan (www.nexcess.net)
and Canada (www.tera-byte.com). Although California has reputable ser-
vice providers, these two came highly recommended and I’ve had great expe-
riences hosting Web sites with both companies.
Can I host more than one domain name?
As you compare options, you may notice that some providers charge more
for packages that enable you to host multiple domain names. You might
choose a package that supports multiple domain names if you want each
member of the family to be able to register their own domain name and set
up their own site separately. For example, you could set up www.Jean
Doherty.com, www.JoshDoherty.com, and www.TheDohertyFamily.com as
separate sites on the same account. Although a Web hosting package that
supports multiple domain names is more expensive, it may save you money
compared to the cost of setting up a different Web hosting account for each
family member’s Web site.
Note that there is a difference between hosting multiple domain names that
point to different Web sites, as in the example in the preceding paragraph,
and pointing two or more domain names to the same site. If you want two
names, such as www.TheDohertyFamily.com and www.TheDohertys.com, to
both direct visitors to the same site, you can manage that with your domain
name registrar and save the cost of a premium Web server account that sup-
ports multiple domain names. Check with your domain name registrar for
more information on how to direct multiple domain names to the same Web
server.
Publishing a Web Site to a Server
After you build your Web site on your own computer, you transfer the site’s
files to your Web server by using a technology protocol called FTP.

58
Part I: Introducing Family Web Sites 
The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) describes the system used to transfer any
files from one computer to another on the Internet. The term is often used as
a verb, as in, “Can you FTP that graphic to the Web server?” A number of free-
ware and shareware programs have been designed for file transfers, such as
Fetch for the Macintosh and WS_FTP for Windows.
FTP might seem like computer magic at first, but it’s simple and easy to do.
To upload — or FTP — your site, you just copy files from your computer to
your server. FrontPage 2003 has built-in FTP capabilities, making this process
almost automatic. In Chapter 8, I provide step-by-step instructions on how to
use FrontPage 2003 to FTP your Web site to your server.
If you’re not using FrontPage 2003 or you want an alternative, I recommend
the WS_FTP program. You can download a trial version of WS_FTP from
www.ipswitch.com.
You also find a copy of the WS_FTP program on the CD that accompanies
this book.
To use an FTP program like WS_FTP, follow these steps:
1. Open your FTP program.
FTP programs are relatively simple utilities designed to move files from
one computer to another. Usually they have two windows: One displays
the contents of your computer’s hard drive, and the other displays the
files and folders on your Web server, as shown in Figure 4-3.
2. Enter the information for your service provider.
As you see in Figure 4-4, you need to enter your server’s host name, as
well as your unique user ID and password to connect to your Web server.
3. Click to select the files or folders you want to transfer.
4. Click the arrow that points from the window that represents your
computer to the window that represents the Web server.
The files are automatically transferred from your computer to the
server. This process can take a few minutes depending on the size of
the files you’re transferring.
You can also use an FTP program to transfer files from your Web server to
your computer. Simply select the files in the window that represents your
server and click the arrow that points to the window that represents your
computer.

Part I: Introducing Family Web Sites 
Moving to a New Server
As you consider which ISP is best for you, remember that you can always
move to a new server later if your situation changes. Transferring your Web
site to a new ISP is a relatively painless process, but it does require some
organization if you want to move without your site going down in the
process.
One of the biggest advantages of having your own domain name is that you
get a permanent address. That means your visitors will always use the same
address to find you, even if you move to a server on the other side of the
world.
If you don’t have your own domain name, your Web address will include the
name of your service provider. That means if you change service providers,
you have to change your address, too. (You can find more information about
domain names in Chapter 3.)
Follow these general steps to move your site to a new service provider and
redirect your domain name:
1. Set up an account with a new service provider.
2. Transfer the files from your site to the new server and test your site on
the new server to make sure everything works properly.
3. Notify the service where you registered your domain name that the
name should be redirected to the new server. You can usually make the
request to redirect your domain name yourself by filling out a few forms
on your registrar’s Web site.
4. After you request that your domain be redirected, your service provider
will send you an e-mail message to verify that you really want to make
the change. This ensures that you haven’t made the request by accident
and that no one else is trying to steal your domain name by redirecting
it to another server without your permission. The request may expire if
not confirmed, so respond to this verification e-mail promptly.
5. After your domain name is safely directed at the new server and every-
thing is in working order, notify your old service provider to close your
account.
Comparing Free Hosting Services
The word free makes many people skeptical. You may be wondering what’s
the catch, so before I tell you about some free hosting sites on the Web, let
me tell you what you can expect from them.

61
Chapter 4: Choosing a Web Hosting Service Provider
First, you’ll face many design limitations. You can’t just upload your own Web
site to their server as you can with a commercial service provider. Instead,
you’re generally limited to using the templates and designs provided by the
free site. So the first thing you give up is design control and options.
Second, you’ll be limited in the size of your site and the amount of bandwidth
you can use. If you want to put lots of big photos online, you may quickly run
out of space or exceed the bandwidth limitations. When that happens, your
viewers might be greeted with an error message instead of your pages.
And finally, you’ll have to share your pages with advertising — that’s the real
catch. These free sites make money by selling advertising that they display
across the pages they host, and you won’t have any control over the ads that
may appear on your pages. Across the top of your family Web site, you may
find a car ad one day and an ad for diet pills or an online gambling site the
next day.
If you don’t mind these limitations or think they’re worth it because the price
is right, keep reading. Just remember, Web site hosting can cost as little as
$5 per month, so you may not be saving much with a free site. (Also beware
of bait-and-switch tricks. Many of these sites try to attract users with free
server space and then sell premium services for a fee. Before you pay for
these added services, shop around. You may find comparable services for a
much better price elsewhere.)
The following services provide free, basic Web hosting services:
 Yahoo! Geocities (www.geocities.com): This popular one-stop solution
to e-mail and Web page hosting also provides PageBuilder, PageWizard,
and SiteWizard. These programs enable you to use basic click-and-drag
techniques to arrange your photos and text, and provide some simple
templates into which you can insert your content.
 Angelfire (www.angelfire.com): Especially popular among young
people, Angelfire, shown in Figure 4-5, offers free, basic Web site hosting,
if you don’t mind sharing your pages with their advertisers. Owned and
operated by Terra-Lycos, this site features a variety of other options
(prices vary by service), including a blogging program, as well as pre-
mium services that let you store up to 100MB of images and MP3 music
files. (If you want to know more about blogging, see Chapter 15.)
 Tripod (www.tripod.com): Also owned by Terra-Lycos, Tripod is
designed to reach a more mature market than Angelfire, but it features a
similar suite of options, including basic Web site hosting for free (with
ads), and the option to upgrade to more advanced services, such as
their blogging software, for a fee.

Although none of these free services will let you set up a site with your own
domain name (instead, they assign you a name like www.geocities.com/
yourusername), you can register a domain name at a site such as www.
godaddy.com and then use the services offered by your domain registration
service to forward your domain name to your address at the free Web server.
Then when visitors type your domain name, they’ll be directed to the free
site by your domain registrar.

W
hat would your family Web site be without pictures? Adding images,
such as vacation photos and old family portraits, can make your Web
site more attractive and bring family stories to life. But how do you get those
great images on your computer so you can add them to your Web site?
Consider scanning your children’s artwork and keepsakes, as well as the
great prints you’ve taken over the years. And if that’s not enough, add clip art
and royalty-free photos (professional pictures can enhance the overall look of
your site and compliment your snapshots).
In this chapter, you discover how to download images from Web sites through
a browser, such as Internet Explorer or Netscape, and where to purchase clip
art and photos on CDs. You also find out how to scan printed materials, such
as artwork and photos, with Adobe Photoshop Elements 3 and a scanner, and
retrieve images from a digital camera. In Chapter 6 you find an introduction to
editing photos and preparing them for the Web, and in Chapter 7 you find tips
for organizing images and using Elements 3 to create Web photo galleries and
photo album pages.
Click! Using Images You Find Online
So you’ve surfed to a site that has an image on it that you’d love to use on
your Web site. Maybe it’s a still image from your favorite movie, or a photo of
the Sydney Opera House, which is exciting for you because your family went
to Australia last year. Maybe it’s a picture of a cartoon character that bears a

strong resemblance to your spouse. Whatever the image and whatever your
reason for wanting to use it, can you just grab it from the Web site and use it
on your site? Well, although it’s technically possible to save the image to your
hard drive, it may not be legal to use it.
Before I show you how to download images from the Web I have to include a
little legal disclaimer. When you publish something on the Internet, you are
in the same category as publishers who produce books or magazines. That
means you have the same legal obligations to respect copyright. Be careful
not to copy images or graphics from other people’s Web sites without asking
permission. You find a few guidelines about copyrighted material in the fol-
lowing section.
How do you know what you can and can’t use? Most commercial photos,
taken by professional photographers or journalists, are copyrighted. When
an image is copyrighted, the person who owns the rights has the right to
determine who can use it. Generally, you need to either purchase the right to
use a photo or obtain written permission. Simply giving credit to the photog-
rapher by name or citing the source of the image is usually not enough.
The same goes for cartoons, drawings, artwork, and clippings from newspa-
pers and magazines. For example, scanning a greeting card and using the
image on your Web site would almost surely violate the copyright of the
greeting card company.
The exceptions? Images you find on Web sites that offer copyright-free images,
images you purchase with the expressed right to reuse the images, and images
that are considered public domain, such as vintage photos where the original
photographer is unknown or where the subject of the photo is a person, place,
or thing that’s considered public property. For example, you can find many
freely available photos of the Statue of Liberty, presidents, Mount Rushmore,
and other common subjects.
So, now that the attorneys are happy, here are the steps to follow if you do
have the right to use an image and want to copy it from a Web site:
1. In a Web browser, open the Web page containing the image you want.
2. Place your cursor directly over the image and right-click (in Windows)
or click and hold (on the Mac).
A pop-up menu appears, as shown in Figure 5-1.
3. Choose Save Picture As from the drop-down menu.
The Save Picture dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 5-2.
4. If you want, type a new name in the File name box.
5. Click Save.
The image is saved to the specified location.
66
Part II: Lookin’ Good: Images and Design 

After you’ve saved the image, you can use it as you would any other image
you create or capture on your hard drive.
If you follow these steps and the Save Picture As command is dimmed, the
site’s designer has protected the images from copying and saving, and you
won’t be able to save the image to your hard drive.

Chapter 5: Gathering Images: Scanning, Downloading, and Finding Clip Art

Searching for Photos and Clip Art
Now where do you find professional photos, artwork, cartoons, and more for
your site? On the Web, of course, and also on CD.
For the most part, clip art refers to graphic images, such as cartoons, draw-
ings, and sketches, and the word stock is used when referring to photographs.
An image that’s royalty free isn’t necessarily free. Royalty free means you don’t
have to continue to pay royalties for the right to use an image or graphic.
When downloading free images, purchasing images from a Web site, or using
clip art or photos from a CD, be sure to check the fine print for any restric-
tions. For example, some images are free to use on only noncommercial sites.
If you sell products or services through your family site, you may have to pay
a higher fee for commercial use.
Finding royalty-free images 
and clip art online
If you’re looking for a specific image, such as a drawing of a duck for a baby
site, try an online search (for example, type ducks + free clip art in Google).
You can find an extraordinary amount of free images on the Web, but you
often get what you pay for.
If you’re willing to invest a little in quality images, I recommend the following.
Some of these sites provide free images, but most charge a usage fee, espe-
cially for the highest quality images.
Most of the sites listed here offer the same images at high, medium, and low
resolution, and some charge more for the highest resolution. When you’re
talking about images, resolution refers to the amount of detail in an image.
The higher the resolution, the bigger the file size and the better the quality
of the image. As a general rule, you’ll want high-resolution images only if you
plan to print them (especially if you want to make large prints). On the Web,
low resolution is preferred because the file size is smaller and the file down-
loads faster.
Most image sites enable you to search through photos and other graphics by
keyword (for example, you could search for photos of Paris to find professional
photos to complement your travel pictures). Some of these sites also have
images organized in categories you can browse. All these sites make it easy to
download pictures immediately:
68
Part II: Lookin’ Good: Images and Design 

 Public Domain Images (www.pdimages.com): As the name implies, this
site provides access to a wide range of images considered to be in the
public domain because the photographer is either unknown or has relin-
quished the copyright. Although they do charge for some of the images
on this site, many are available for free.
 Getty Images, Inc. (www.gettyimages.com): Getty Images is the largest
supplier of royalty-free digital imagery on the Web, specializing in pho-
tographs and illustrations of a wide variety of subjects, including film
footage. Pay for images and footage as you go.
 Stockbyte (www.stockbyte.com): Stockbyte is a great source for inter-
national royalty-free photos. You can purchase photographs at a high or
low resolution.
 Photos.com (www.photos.com): Photos.com is a subscription-based 
service for royalty-free stock photography and photo objects. A 1- to 12-
month subscription gives you unlimited access and use of its collection.
 ImageSource (www.imagesource.com): You can register on this site for
free and search through a vast array of professional photos, paying only
for what you select to download.
 Clipart Connection (www.clipartconnection.com): A great source for
free clip art and animations designed for the Web.
 Clipart.com (www.clipart.com): This subscription-based site boasts
the largest collection of clip art on the Web, but you have to pay a
weekly, monthly, or annual fee.
 Web Promotion (www.webpromotion.com): A great source for animated
GIFs and other Web graphics. Artwork on this site is free.
Purchasing photos and clip art on CD
Photo and clip art CDs are available in most office supply stores and copier
or printer stores, and you can often get a big selection of images for $10 or
less. CDs with hundreds of images on them are not hard to find, and many
come with images in several popular categories. You can also buy specialized
collections, such as ocean images, nature scenes, pictures of animals, cars,
homes, famous locations, or people.
A search for photos on CD (using Google, Yahoo, or another search site) will
result in a long list of sites that sell images on CD. Here are a few sites where
you can order clip art and photo CDs:
 Photos for Me (www.photosforme.com): This site offers CD collections
of photos, graphics, and even video.
 PunchStock (www.punchstock.com): Boasting 550,000 images from more
than 30 vendors, you’re sure to find what you’re looking for at this CD site.

Chapter 5: Gathering Images: Scanning, Downloading, and Finding Clip Art

Working with Scanners
Scanners have had a huge effect on the types of images you can include on
a Web site. In the past, you had to use a professional copier service to turn
printed artwork, photos, and drawings into electronic images. Now, with the
widespread use of scanners, capturing digital images for your Web site has
never been easier.
Scanning printed images for your site
Now that scanners are available for less than $100, many families are investing
in these seemingly magical devices. You can scan not only old photographs
and printed materials, but also just about anything you can fit on the glass
plate of your scanner. Some newer scanners, such as the HP Scanjet 4670,
make it possible to scan oversized artwork with a detachable glass plate that
can be moved across a large image or object.
Use your imagination — scan your hand to show far-away relatives your
engagement ring, scan a piece of china to show off a special pattern, scan the
lid of a painted box to create a beautiful abstract image, or scan fabrics to
create textured images (great for background images and buttons). Just be
careful not to scratch the delicate glass on the scanner.
Some scanning suggestions:
 You can scan only the area that interests you or that will fit within the
intended display or print space. This works well if you want to eliminate
some people in a group photo or want to select only the flower bed from
a picture taken in someone’s back yard.
 You can scan in color or in black and white, regardless of the nature of
the original. In fact, it’s often best to scan black-and-white photos as
color because it gives you more image content to work with when you’re
editing the image later. Scanning in color is especially important if you
want to use a program such as Photoshop Elements to add color to a
black-and-white image after it’s scanned.
 You can scan your images at a high resolution, creating a very large file
and preserving as much detail as possible, or you can scan at a low reso-
lution, creating a smaller file with less fine detail. If you plan to do any
editing of the image before it finds its way to your Web site, scan it at a
higher resolution (300 ppi or higher) so that you have lots of content to
work with. As you find out in Chapter 6, you can reduce the image resolu-
tion later, after the desired edits are completed, by optimizing the image.

Setting up your scanner
Scanners have become exceptionally easy to use. Modern scanners are plug
and play, meaning all you have to do is connect the scanner to your com-
puter and install the scanner software. Although your scanner software
should enable you to scan, fax, and e-mail images, I generally prefer to scan
images with an image editor, such as Photoshop Elements.
Every scanner is different so you should follow the instructions that come
with your system. Many manufacturers instruct you to simply connect the
scanner and restart your computer. Others direct you to install the software
on the CD before you connect the scanner. Either way, it’s a relatively pain-
less process. Unless you run into conflicts or have faulty equipment, you
should be able to get a new scanner up and running in a matter of minutes.
The installation process informs not only the operating system, but also all
your applications, that a scanner is now available. This means if you start
Photoshop Elements after installing your scanner, the File➪Import menu will
include your scanner by name, as shown in Figure 5-3.

Chapter 5: Gathering Images: Scanning, Downloading, and Finding Clip Art

Scanning an image
When you’re ready to scan an image, place it so it faces the scanner’s glass
plate. Position the image or object you want to scan by following any sym-
bols (such as arrows or dots) or picture instructions (icons that look like a
sheet of paper) that appear along the edges of the plate. Don’t worry too
much about making sure the image is facing the right direction, you can
always rotate it later in an image program such as Elements by choosing
Image➪Rotate).
Most scanners have a “sweet spot” that gives you the best scan possible. See
the instructions that came with your scanner or do some experiments to find
the best placement for your scanner. (The sweet spot is usually in the middle.)
You have two primary options for scanning in Photoshop Elements 3. If you
want to use your scanner’s software, start from the Editor view in Elements
and choose File➪Import, and then select your scanner’s name from the list of
options (refer to Figure 5-3). Elements launches your scanner software and
imports the image after the scan is complete.
If you want to use the scanning features built into Elements 3 (which I prefer),
you start from the Organizer view and use the scan dialog box, as shown in
Figure 5-4.

Part II: Lookin’ Good: Images and Design 

To scan an image from the Organizer view in Elements, follow these steps:
1. From the Organizer in Photoshop Elements, choose File➪Get
Photos➪From Scanner, as shown in Figure 5-5.
Note: To open Organizer view, click the Photo Browser button at the top
of the Editor workspace or choose the View and Organize Photos button
on the Welcome screen when you first launch Elements.
2. In the Get Photos from Scanner dialog box, select the scanner you
want to use.
If you’ve connected your scanner properly, it should appear in the list. If
your scanner is not visible, consult the scanner’s manual.
3. Use the Browse button to select the folder where you want to save
your scanned images.
Elements saves scanned images in its Scanned Photos folder, but you
can specify any folder available on your computer system.
4. Specify the format and adjust the quality settings.
You can choose to save your scan as a JPEG, TIFF, or PNG file. As a gen-
eral rule, JPEG is best for photographs for the Web, TIFF is best for print,
and PNG is best for line art, such as drawings. Your choice doesn’t matter
too much at this stage because you can convert the image to any format
available in Elements after you finish the scan.

73
Chapter 5: Gathering Images: Scanning, Downloading, and Finding Clip Art

The quality settings apply to only JPEG — the higher the quality, the
more detail you will get in the scan and the larger the file size. As a gen-
eral rule, choose a mid to high quality to get the best scan. (See Chapter
6 for instructions on reducing and optimizing images for the Web, an
important final step before placing an image on a Web page.) In the
example shown in 5-6, I’ve chosen to scan my image as a JPEG at the
Maximum quality setting.
5. Click OK.
The Scan dialog box opens.
6. Select the scan option that corresponds to the type of image you’re
scanning.
7. Click the Preview button.
A preview of the image appears in the dialog box.
8. Click a handle at the edge of the preview and drag to adjust the pre-
view to cover only the area you want to scan.
In the example shown in Figure 5-7, I dragged the handles to select only
the photograph in the middle of the scanner plate, eliminating the white
border around the image and the remainder of the scanner plate.
9. Click the Scan button to scan the image.
The scanner makes a final pass over the image and the final scanned ver-
sion appears in the New Photos window in the Organizer.
To use Elements edit features, click to select the image in the New Photos
window and then click the Edit Your Photo button at the top of the screen.
You find further instructions for editing, resizing, and optimizing images for
the Web in Chapter 6.

Part II: Lookin’ Good: Images and Design 

If you want to scan several photos at once, say three or four photos from a
batch of prints, you can lay them on the scanner’s plate side by side and scan
them as a group. You can also place them all on the scanner bed and then use
the preview and resizing process to scan them one at a time if you want to
capture each one separately. Either option is likely to save you time replacing
images between scans.
Downloading Images from 
a Digital Camera
In the early days of digital cameras, downloading images was a complex
process that involved connecting your camera to your computer with a spe-
cial cable and then using a software program to download the images to your
hard drive. You can still use that option with most digital cameras, but today
there are simpler ways to get your images on your computer. The options
described in this section can be used with most digital cameras (consult the
manual that came with your digital camera for details about your system).
Copying images from a memory card
If you have the right card reader in your computer or printer, you can simply
remove the memory card from your camera, slide it into your computer, and
copy the files to your hard drive as you’d copy images from a CD or floppy
disk. Most digital cameras use CompactFlash cards, SmartMedia cards, or
some other kind of removable storage device. Many computers now come
with all these card readers built in. However, if your computer doesn’t have
Figure 5-7:

Chapter 5: Gathering Images: Scanning, Downloading, and Finding Clip Art

what you need, you can buy adapters that will let you use a PCMCIA slot or
USB port. (Check with your local computer store to find the right adapters
for your system.)
Importing images directly into 
an image program
If you’ve installed the software that came with your digital camera and you
have an image program such as Photoshop Elements 3 you can import images
directly into your image editor. This option may help you keep track of your
images and save you the step of opening them in the editor or adding them
into the Organizer after you’ve copied them from the camera. This option also
works for retrieving images from a cellphone or other device.
To import images into Elements from a digital camera or other device, make
sure Elements is in the Organizer view and follow these steps:
1. Insert your camera’s memory card into the appropriate slot on your
computer or plug your camera into the computer with the cable that
came with your camera.
Consult the camera’s manual for more detailed instructions, if necessary.
Note: If Photoshop Elements is open when you connect your camera or
insert a memory card, the Get Photos from Camera or Card Reader dialog
box may open automatically. If so, skip the next step.
2. Choose File➪Get Photos➪From Camera or Card Reader.
The Get Photos from Camera or Card Reader dialog box appears.
3. Click to deselect any images you don’t want to import.
Elements automatically selects all the images on the camera or memory
card, but you can click to uncheck any images you don’t want to import.
4. Specify where you want to save your images.
Elements saves your images in a new subfolder named with the date you
are saving the images. As you see in Figure 5-8, I’m saving these images
on 10-31 — and yes, I’ve been interrupted many times tonight by trick-
or-treaters. If you prefer, click the New Name option; you can change the
name of the subfolder to anything you like, or use the Browse button to
specify a folder on your hard drive.
5. Select the Rename Files option and enter a name in the text field.
Elements will use the name you enter, followed by sequential numbers,
beginning with 001. If you don’t select the Rename Box, Elements will
save your files with their current names; if you’re copying files from a
digital camera, those current names are probably a long number that
has no meaning to you.
76
Part II: Lookin’ Good: Images and Design 

6. Click the Get Photos button.
Elements copies your images from the camera or card to your com-
puter’s hard drive, saves them in the specified folder, and displays them
in the New Photos window. When the download is complete, the Delete
Files on Device dialog box opens.
7. In the Delete Files on Device dialog box, choose Yes to delete the files
from your camera or card reader or No to leave them untouched.
To retrieve images from a cellphone, choose File➪Get Photos➪
From Mobile Phone, and then follow Steps 3 through 7.
After your images are downloaded from a camera, a cellphone, or another
device, you can work with them as you would any other image. In Chapter 6,
you find instructions for editing, cropping, and optimizing your images so
that they load quickly and look their best on your Web pages.

n the old days, my grandmother carefully cut printed pictures into clever
shapes to create designs for her holiday letters and photo album pages. If
she were still with us today, she’d be amazed by all the ways you can edit,
alter, and restore photographs with a computer.
In this chapter, you leave the scissors and glue behind and discover some
of the extraordinary things you can do today with a program like Photoshop
Elements 3. You find out how to correct red eye (if the flash makes your sub-
jects look like zombies), how to resize images, and even how to restore old
pictures.
Perhaps most important in this book about creating Web sites, the last part
of this chapter helps you understand the differences between the main image
formats that work on the Internet — JPEG and GIF — and how to optimize
your images so that they download more quickly.
You can use a number of competing image editing programs to complete
the tasks described in this book. I recommend Adobe Photoshop Elements 3
because it’s based on the industry standard in image editing, Adobe Photoshop
CL, but is a lot easier to use. And at about $100, Elements is also a great value.

Introducing the Elements Workspace
Although Photoshop Elements 3 is a stripped-down version of its big sister pro-
gram Adobe Photoshop CL, it’s still a powerful tool. The workspace, shown in
Figure 6-1, is clean and simple, and its myriad tools and palettes can be moved
and resized so you can customize the program to fit your work style.
To help you get familiar with the program, this section introduces you to the
four primary components of the workspace: the toolbox, options bar, menu
bar, palettes.
The toolbox
Shown in Figure 6-2, the Elements toolbox has 22 buttons and the primary
color picker. You can use these tools to alter, copy, crop, and retouch images,
select portions of an image, paint in the image, and enter text.

Many toolbox buttons have a small triangle in the lower-right corner, indicat-
ing that multiple tools are accessible from the button. To view these alternate
tools, simply click and hold the button for a moment, until a small fly-out
menu appears, as shown in Figure 6-3.

Chapter 6: Creating and Editing Images for the Web

The options bar
Running across the top of the Elements workspace is the options bar (labeled
in Figure 6-1), containing drop-down lists, check boxes, and radio buttons,
each controlling how the currently selected tool will work. For example,
when the paint brush tool is active, options are available for changing the
size and shape of the brush. Switch to the text tool, and the options bar fea-
tures font and size options, much like a toolbox in a word processor.
The menu bar
No program is complete without a menu bar (labeled in Figure 6-1). Click the
menu names and you can choose from a list of commands. If an ellipsis (...)
follows the command name, the command launches a dialog box with addi-
tional options. Otherwise, the command kicks in automatically.
If you do something to your image you don’t like, the greatest menu command
ever created (for this program and any other) is Edit➪Undo. If you’re a key-
board shortcut fan, that’s Ctrl+Z in Windows and Ô-Z on the Mac.
The palettes
Like every Adobe application, the Elements workspace is filled with palettes,
small windows that hold formatting options and other setting. The various
palettes provide tools to help you edit and examine your image. To open a
palette, select its name from the Window menu. For example, Window➪
Color Swatches opens a palette with color options. Note that each palette
has a More button. Clicking More displays a list of additional commands.
Palettes can be left in their column on the right side of the workspace or
dragged out into the workspace, as shown in Figure 6-4 where I’m applying a
bevel to a small image to create a button. To move a palette, drag it by its tab,
and release it where you like. After you detach a palette from the main appli-
cation window, it gains its own title bar for easy moving and identification.
82
Part II: Lookin’ Good: Images and Design 

Cropping and Resizing Images
Cropping and resizing images are two of the most important things you should
do when you prepare an image for the Web. Resizing is important for two rea-
sons. One, you want images to be small enough to display well on a computer
monitor. Two, the smaller you make the image, the more you reduce the size
and the faster the image downloads to your user’s computer.
When you crop an image, you cut off the top, bottom, or sides, reducing the
overall size of the image. Cropping is especially important on the Web because
it’s harder to view an image on a computer screen. Figure 6-5 is a good exam-
ple of how cropping can help focus attention on the subject of an image while
removing distracting background elements, such as the lamp to the left. In
addition, cropping results in a smaller image, a bonus when you then go to
resize the image.

83
Chapter 6: Creating and Editing Images for the Web

To crop a photo in Photoshop Elements, follow these steps:
1. With the image open in Elements, select the cropping tool from the
Tools palette (labeled in Figure 6-5).
2. Click and drag within the image to designate the area you want
to crop.
To increase or decrease the size of the cropping box, drag the handles at
the corners or edges of the crop area.
3. Double-click in the middle of the selected area to complete the crop.
(You can also click the cropping tool again to complete or cancel the
crop.) The cropped area disappears.
To resize a photo in Photoshop Elements, follow these steps:
1. With the image open in Elements, choose Image➪Resize➪Image Size.
The Image Size dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 6-6.

84
Part II: Lookin’ Good: Images and Design 

2. Specify the height or the width.
Although you have multiple options for changing image size, I think the
simplest option is to adjust the image size in the Pixel Dimensions area
at the top of the screen and use the percentage setting. If you keep the
Constrain Proportions box selected, you need to change only the height
or the width. Elements automatically adjusts the corresponding setting
to maintain the original proportions of the image. 
3. Leave the other settings unchanged.
Unless you know that you want to change the resolution, scale, or pro-
portions, leave those at the default settings. Although you will probably
want to change your image resolution (72 dpi is optimal for the Web), it’s
best to make that change in the Save for Web dialog box described in the
“Optimizing Images for the Web” section, later in this chapter. Making
other adjustments in this dialog box gets complicated and it’s easy to
distort the image.
4. Click OK.
The image is resized.
When you view an image in Elements, you can display it at full size, or you
can use the zoom tool (labeled in Figure 6-2) to increase or decrease the size
in which the image appears on your screen.
By changing the display size, you can figure out how much you want to change
the actual size of your image. Here’s how: Click to select the zoom tool from
the toolbox, and then click anywhere on the image to increase the display size.
Alt+click (on a PC) or Option+click (on a Mac) to decrease the display size.
When the image is the size you want, look at the percentage (displayed at the
very top of the screen next to the file name). Then enter that percentage in the
Image Size dialog box.
Figure 6-6:
Use the
Image Size
dialog to
change the
dimensions
of an image.
85
Chapter 6: Creating and Editing Images for the Web

To redisplay the image in its actual size on your monitor, double-click the
zoom tool.
Adjusting the size of a digital image is more complicated than many people
imagine because you have to consider the physical dimensions of the image
in relation to its resolution. Resolution is affected by the number of dots per
inch in the image (the dpi) and the size and number of the dots depend on
many factors. If you’re looking at a picture on a computer screen, for exam-
ple, the image can be displayed only at 72 dpi, the resolution of the average
monitor. If you’re printing the image on a printer, where the resolution can
vary from about 300 to 1200 dpi or more, the image may print much smaller
than it looked on the screen because of the higher dpi.
In the Image Size dialog box (refer to Figure 6-6), the Pixel Dimensions area rep-
resents what you see on the screen. If you set the width to 500 pixels, the image
should span 500 pixels across the screen at 72 dpi no matter what because the
computer monitor display is set at 72 dpi. The Document Size area represents
the size you expect your image to be when you print it, but only if you print it
at the specified resolution. If the Document Size is .8 inches at 216 dpi (refer to
the example in Figure 6-6) and you print the picture on a 1200 dpi printer, it
won’t print at .8 inches.
I can’t possibly explain the intricacies of image resolution and printing in this
book. If you want to find out more about Photoshop Elements, I recommend
Photoshop Elements 3 For Dummies by Deke McClelland and Galen Fott (pub-
lished by Wiley).
Replacing and Editing Content
Do you have an image in which something is just a bit out of balance? Maybe
the family’s too close to the left edge of the photo, and you have a big gap on
the other side. Perhaps Uncle Mike has a lamp sticking out of his shoulder.
Whether it’s a small object, multiple objects, or entire members of the family,
moving (or removing) them is no big deal.
Selecting content
Before you can manipulate or change something in an image, you have to
select it. Photoshop Elements has various selection tools but the primary
ones are the marquee tools, the lasso tools, and the selection brush.
86
Part II: Lookin’ Good: Images and Design 

The marquee tools
To see both the rectangular and the elliptical marquee tools, click the 
downward-pointing arrow at the corner of the marquee tool (labeled in Fig-
ure 6-7). You use these tools to select squarish or circular regions of your
image. Simply click to select either tool, and then move your cursor into the
image to see the cursor’s crosshairs. Then click and drag with your mouse to
mark off the desired region, as shown in Figure 6-7.
To make a perfectly square or perfectly round selection, hold down the Shift
key while dragging with a marquee tool.
The lasso tools
Located next to the marquee tools are the three lasso tools: the lasso, the
magnetic lasso, and the polygonal lasso (refer to Figure 6-3). The lasso tool is
used to make freehand selections. Simply click the tool, move your cursor to
your document, and draw a selection around what you want. In Figure 6-8,
the lasso tool is being used to select just the barn.

Chapter 6: Creating and Editing Images for the Web

The magnetic lasso tool snaps itself to pixels that have a high degree of con-
trast to neighboring pixels, such as a dark object against a light background.
Simply click the magnetic lasso where you want to begin and move the cursor
around the object, and the selection line snaps to the object’s outline.
The polygonal lasso tool enables you to snap to straight selection lines, one
click at a time. Simply click in one location with your cursor to start, move to
a new location, and click. Elements sets down a straight line between these
points.
The selection brush
For my money, the selection brush is the greatest addition to the toolbox yet.
With this selection tool, you simply choose your brush size and then drag
your cursor over the area you want to select, as if you were painting it with a
paintbrush.
Cutting, copying, and pasting
After you have something selected, you can cut, copy, or paste that selection
anywhere in your document. These three commands are found on the Edit
Figure 6-8:

After you make a selection in an image (as detailed in the preceding section),
you’re ready to delete, copy, move, or change your image by using the steps in

closer to another, remove an object (or a person) from an image, or even
replace one part of an image with a section you’ve copied from another image.

Chapter 6: Creating and Editing Images for the Web
Selecting layers and tools in Photoshop images
If you find yourself trying to edit or alter part of
your image but the program won’t let you, here
are a few tips that may help cut down on your
frustration.
Photoshop Elements is a complex program with
many tools and options, and if you don’t choose
just the right one, you may run into trouble. This
can be confusing until you get used to it, but
keep in mind that each tool in the Tools palette
is designed to do just one job, For example, if
you’re entering text with the text tool and then
you decide you want to move that text to
another part of the page, you have to first select
the move tool.
Another confusing feature is the concept of
layers in Photoshop Elements. Essentially,
layers enable Elements to separate an image
into different parts, making it possible to manip-
ulate those parts independently. This is useful,
for example, if you create an image, fill it with
the color blue, and then add text on top of it. The
blue area becomes the background layer and
the text is added as a new layer on top of it.
Because Elements treats the text as a new
layer, you can move the text anytime without
affecting other parts of the image.
To select a layer, simply click the layer name in
the Layers palette (available by choosing
Window➪Layers). The active layer is shaded
grey and appears darker than the other layers.
You can switch from one layer to another by
clicking the desired layer, and you can even
move layers in the Layers palette by clicking and
dragging. If you want a layer to cover another
layer, for example, move it higher up the list.
If you’re trying to do something in the program
that you think should work but doesn’t, you
probably haven’t selected the correct tool or
layer. Keep this is mind, and you can save your-
self a lot of grief as you find how to use this truly
great program.

To cut and paste a selected area of an image, follow these steps:
1. Using the selection tool of your choice, select the content you want to
reposition.
See the preceding section for details on the different selection tools.
2. Choose Edit➪Cut.
The content disappears from the image, shown in Figure 6-9, where I’ve
cut one of the seals out of this image. (Don’t worry, you’ll paste it back
in to make it reappear in the next step.)
3. Move your cursor to the part of the image where you want the content
to be moved and choose Edit➪Paste.
You can also move your cursor onto any other image open in Elements
and paste the selection into a different image file. The part of the image
that you selected and cut is inserted into the image on a new layer, as
shown in Figure 6-10, where you can see that I’ve moved the seal a little
away from its original location.
4. Click the move tool (labeled in Figure 6-10).
Figure 6-9:

a section
out of an

move it to
another
place in the

or paste into
a different
image.
90
Part II: Lookin’ Good: Images and Design 

5. Click and drag to reposition the pasted section, as shown in Figure 6-11.
The pasted content moves as you drag it around the screen. You can
also use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move a layer (a good trick
for making more precise adjustments). When you move the image, make
sure to click in the middle of it; if you click a handle on the edge you risk
resizing or rotating the pasted section.
When you use the paste function, the newly created layer becomes active
by default. However, it’s easy to click another layer area and lose track of
the layer you want to be manipulating. To make sure that the desired layer
is active, check the Layers palette. The active layer is shaded grey and
appears darker than the other layers. To select a layer, simply click the
layer name in the Layers palette.
6. To resize or rotate the pasted section, use the handles that appear
around it.
If you want to resize a layer, click and drag a corner handle. To rotate the
layer, place your cursor slightly beyond a corner handle until it changes
to a curved, two-headed arrow. Using the curved arrow, drag your cursor
clockwise or counterclockwise to rotate the image section. In the exam-
ple, shown in Figure 6-11, I rotated the seal slightly so that it would line
up better next to the other two seals.

Working with the clone stamp tool
If you’ve deleted content or moved content from one spot to another, you
probably have a hole that needs filling. The clone stamp tool (visible in
Figure 6-1), copies content from one part of an image to another. You can use
this tool to cover up unwanted items, such as a zit on someone’s nose, by
copying one area and pasting it over the item you want to remove. This is an
amazing tool because it makes a precise replica of the pattern in the selected
area, creating such a perfect patch that even your mother won’t notice that
you’ve cleaned up your acne.
To use the clone stamp tool, follow these steps:
1. Select the clone stamp tool (labeled in Figure 6-12).
2. Position the cursor over an area of the image you want to sample.
3. Alt-click (Windows) or Option-click (Mac) to designate the sampling
point, the portion you want to copy from.
4. Move your cursor to the area you want to cover, and click and drag to
begin painting.
The sampled area fills the area you’re painting, providing an ideal way to
replace a pattern, such as the sand in Figure 6-12.

You can change the clone stamp tool options, such as size and opacity, by
adjusting the tool options in the options bar at the top of the screen.
Repairing the Signs of Wear, 
Tear, and Age
If you have old photos stacked in drawers or boxes, chances are the images
are getting cracked, scratched, ripped, torn, spotted, or stained. Perhaps
entire sections of the image are destroyed.
If you find your favorite images have suffered this fate, don’t panic. You can
solve many of these problems by using Elements, after you can the images
into your computer. The images probably can’t be restored to their perfect
original condition, but in most cases they can be salvaged so that you aren’t
reduced to heaving them on the dustheap of family history.
Scratches, tears, or cracked edges can be restored easily by replacing miss-
ing content with other content from the same image (or another image), as

Chapter 6: Creating and Editing Images for the Web

we’ve just seen. With a little ingenuity, you can bring back lost details, as well
as remove stains and spots. No, this isn’t an ad for a household cleaning
product. Using the brush, smudge, dodge, and burn tools, by themselves or
in concert, you can correct just about anything that’s happened to your old
photos. (Too bad we don’t have tools like that in real life.)
Scratches, scuffs, and tears (along edges or even right down the middle of
the image) are easily repaired with the following tools:
 The Dust & Scratches filter: Use this filter to remove scratches and scuff
marks.
 The smudge tool: Blend away small blemishes, tiny scratches, spots,
holes from a thumbtack, and more with the smudge tool.
 The dodge tool: This tool lightens dark regions and shadows to bring
out detail lost to fading and stains.
 The burn tool: The reverse of the dodge tool, the burn tool darkens the
region you apply it to. This is handy for scuff-marks and some types of
stains.
Using the Dust & Scratches Filter
The purpose of the Dust & Scratches filter is apparent in its name. When you
scratch the surface of a photo, you typically get a white line. Dust tends to
form dark splotches on the photo’s surface. The Dust & Scratches filter
attempts to compensate for these defects by locating adjacent pixels with a
high degree of difference in contrast and color. It then reduces those differ-
ences, resulting in a smoother, more even distribution of color and contrast.
This filter is not the solution for really big scratches and tears, but it’s just
the thing for an image covered in multiple tiny scratches that has a beat-up,
dusty look.
To use the Dust & Scratches filter, follow these steps:
1. Select the portion of the photo that you want to correct.
If you’re not sure how to make a selection, see the “Replacing and
Editing Content” section, earlier this chapter. If you don’t make a selec-
tion, the entire photo will be filtered.
2. Choose Filter➪Noise➪Dust & Scratches.
The Dust & Scratches dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-13.
94
Part II: Lookin’ Good: Images and Design 

3. Adjust the Radius for the filter, as desired.
This setting determines the size of the pixel groups to be compared and
their differences in contrast and color. You’ll probably want to keep this
setting on a low number, such as 1 or 2, and use the Threshold settings
to balance it. Click to select the Preview option and your changes are
applied to the image in real time so you can see the effect and find the
best setting. I’ve left it unchecked in the example so you can see the dif-
ference between the original image and the preview of the altered image.
4. Adjust the Threshold setting, as desired.
This setting determines how great the disparity in contrast and color
should when making adjustments to the pixels within the given radius.
You shouldn’t need to go over about 10 or 15 on most images but, again,
use the preview window to find the best setting for your image
5. Check out the results in the Preview window.
Use the (+) and (-) buttons beside the Preview window to zoom in and
out. Drag with your mouse inside the Preview window to reposition and
view different sections of the image.
6. To apply the filter, click OK.

Chapter 6: Creating and Editing Images for the Web

Working with the smudge tool
Small marks, stains, or other little blemishes can be smoothed away with the
smudge tool (labeled in Figure 6-2). For example, you might use the smudge
tool on freckles or small scars on a face, tiny imperfections on furniture, or a
dot on a picture that came from dirt on the camera’s lens, the scanner bed, or
the original image’s surface.
To smudge away small spots, stains, and image imperfections, follow these
steps:
1. Select the smudge tool.
2. Click to insert the cursor where you want to work in the image.
3. Drag a very small distance at a time.
You want to smudge pixels from the clean area around your imperfection
onto the area to be smoothed away.
4. Repeat this process, smudging in tiny increments, until the imperfec-
tion is gone.
If this action doesn’t produce the desired effect (for example, the smudging
effect is too pronounced or in some other way too obvious), try switching to
the clone stamp. 
You can always start over again in Elements by using the Undo command to
reverse your actions — such as a failed attempt at smudging away a blemish.
You can choose Edit➪Undo as many times as you want. (Elements has unlim-
ited Undo capabilities and will reverse any actions taken since the last time a
file was saved.)
I often find that using the clone stamp and the smudge tool in combination is
the best strategy. First use the clone stamp to replace the content, and then
use the smudge tool to smooth out any rough edges. Trial and error is again
the best way to find the right balance for your image. Finding the right tool
depends on the quality of your original image and how you want the final
result to look.
Using the dodge and burn tools
Instead of replacing, covering, or blending pixels, the dodge, burn, and
sponge tools (labeled in Figure 6-2) change brightness, contrast, and color.
Based on real-world darkroom procedures, the dodge and burn tools work in
tandem, having opposite but related effects on pixels. The dodge tool light-
ens, and the burn tool darkens.
96
Part II: Lookin’ Good: Images and Design 

To use the dodge or burn tool, follow these steps:
1. Select the tool of your choice: dodge to lighten, or burn to darken.
2. Place your cursor over the area you want to lighten or darken.
3. Click and drag to dodge or burn.
The area of the image becomes lighter or darker accordingly.
You can adjust the size and exposure of the dodge and burn tools by changing
the brush tool options in the options bar at the top of the screen. Use the Set
the Brush Size option to increase or decrease the area affected by the dodge
or burn tool. Use the Exposure option to increase or decrease the effect.
Lowering the setting can soften the effect; raising the setting can strengthen
the effect. For example, if you’re trying to dodge a dark area in an image so that
it becomes lighter and more of the details are visible in the shadows, lowering
the Exposure setting can make the effect less dramatic, so you can lighten the
area without making it look too light or underexposed.
When I’m using tools such as burn and dodge I often use the Undo command
(my favorite trick in Photoshop Elements). I try something, and if it doesn’t
look right, I choose Edit➪Undo (or press Ctrl+Z on a PC and Ô-Z on a Mac)
and then try again. With this technique, you can experiment with an image
without worrying about doing irreparable damage to it. Photoshop Elements
has unlimited levels of undo, so you can back up multiple steps.
Eliminating Red Eye
Red eye in an image occurs when the light generated by a camera’s flash unit
bounces off the retina of the subject being photographed. It’s a common prob-
lem that has been turning friends and family members into red-eyed monsters
for years. Fortunately, Elements has a special tool dedicated to this common
problem: the red eye removal tool (labeled in Figure 6-2).
To use the red eye removal tool, follow these steps:
1. Click to select the red eye removal tool in the Tools palette.
2. Click and drag the cursor over the red area of an eye.
As soon as you release the mouse button, the red is removed. In Fig-
ure 6-14 I have selected the center of the eye, but not yet released it
to take the red out.
3. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 as necessary.
97
Chapter 6: Creating and Editing Images for the Web

Sometimes the red eye removal tool does too good a job and not only removes
the red but also blackens any reflective highlights on the pupils and leaves eyes
looking lifeless and unnatural. You can compensate for this by using the dodge
tool to lighten any highlights left behind or, if necessary, using the paintbrush
to paint the highlights back in. And, as with any tool in Elements, don’t forget
you can always undo your work with the Edit➪Undo command and try again.
Correcting Colors and Contrast Fast
The color and contrast in your photos can be out of whack for a multitude
of reasons. Time, temperatures, sunlight, and grimy fingers are the usual sus-
pects. Accidents can happen in the darkroom, camera, or film canister as well.
Regardless of the path your image took to its current condition, Elements
offers quick fix mode to help you out. This new editing mode places a series
of the most common photo correction tools in a handy sidebar, allowing you
to choose option buttons or manual sliders to repair your image.
You don’t want to go hog-wild with the quick fix tools, applying three or four
of them at a time. In most cases, color and contrast issues can be corrected
with one or maybe two tools. If your first choice doesn’t solve the problem,
click its corresponding reset button and give another option a try.

Part II: Lookin’ Good: Images and Design 

To use the quick fix tools, click the Quick Fix button at the top of the main
application window. The Quick Fix sidebar appears, as shown in Figure 6-15.
The following options are available in the Quick Fix sidebar:
 To improve color balance, shadows, and highlight details, click the Auto
button next to the words Smart Fix in the General Fixes section. Use the
Amount slider below the Smart Fix Auto button to vary the amount of
the adjustment made to your image.
 To improve contrast and color in your image, click the Auto button next
to Levels in the Lighting section. Auto Levels improves contrast and
color by looking at the lightest and darkest pixels in your image and
compensating when the variance is not sufficient
 To improve the image’s contrast without affecting color, click the
Auto button next to Contrast in the Lighting section. Use the Lighten
Shadows, Darken Highlights, and Midtone Contrast sliders to make
manual adjustments.
Just below the Lighting section of the Quick Fix sidebar is a Color section.
Elements claims that the Auto button in the Color section improves color and
contrast automatically, but you’ll have more control if you use the sliders in
the Color section to make manual changes. It’s easy to overdo color correc-
tion and dramatically change the natural colors of an image.

Chapter 6: Creating and Editing Images for the Web

Choosing the Best Format for the Web
Before you put your images on your Web pages, you need to make sure that
they’re in the right format and optimized, a process of compression and reduc-
tion designed to give an image the highest possible visual quality at the smallest
possible file size.
Why optimize? To provide the best experience for your site visitors, you want
them to see your images quickly. To view an image on a Web page, a browser
has to first download the image file to the local computer. The bigger the file
size, the longer it takes to download. The better an image is optimized, the
faster it will appear.
Fortunately, this is an area where Elements excels. In the Save for Web dialog
box, available from the File menu, you can make a wide range of adjustments
to an image and convert it to any Web format, all in one easy-to-use interface.
You can even preview your image — complete with file size and estimated
download time — as you adjust the settings. This makes it easy to see the
effects of your compression and reduction adjustments in real time and
experiment until you get the results you want. The trick is to make the image
as small as you can while keeping the image at an acceptable quality.
One of the benefits of using the Save for Web dialog box is that Elements cre-
ates a copy of your image when you’re finished, leaving your original file
untouched and creating a new file ready for your Web site. (It’s a good idea
to save your high-quality original because any edits you make in Photoshop
later will work better on a higher resolution version of the image.)
Today’s Web browsers support three file formats: GIF (Graphics Interchange
Format), JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group), and PNG (Portable
Network Graphics). You want to choose the format that’s best for the type
of image you’re working with. In general, use JPEG for multicolored images
such as photographs and GIFs for line art and drawings. PNG is not com-
monly used on the Web but I cover it here because it’s included in Elements
and may be used more on the Web in the future.
Using GIF for art
GIF is an 8-bit format that can have a maximum of 256 colors. When you’re
preparing a GIF file for the Web, the more you limit the number of colors, the
smaller the file size becomes.
If you’ve ever enlarged a digital image, you know that it’s made up of lots and
lots of tiny dots. And if you look closely, you’ll see that the dots are different
100
Part II: Lookin’ Good: Images and Design 

colors and even shades of colors that blend on the computer screen to create
the illusion of a solid image. When you reduce the colors in a GIF file, you’re
essentially taking away some of the colored dots. Often the change is imper-
ceptible when you look at the image at full size, but you have to be careful. If
you take away too many colors, the change can be dramatic and may not be
worth the reduction in file size. In the upcoming optimization section, you
see how the Save for Web dialog box makes it easy to compare how an image
looks with different color settings before you save your changes.
GIFs can also be compressed, a process that further reduces file size. GIFs
use a compression method called LZW, after its creators, Lempel, Ziv, and
Welch. When you compress an image, you essentially remove unused space
within the file. This a lossless compression method that causes little change
in the appearance of the image but can greatly enhance download speed.
Because GIF supports a maximum of only 256 colors in an image, you shouldn’t
use this format to optimize an image with thousands of colors. GIF is best
suited for images with a limited number of total colors, preferably with a high
degree of contrast where the edges at which two colors meet are sharply
defined. The logo in Figure 6-16 is a prime candidate for GIF optimization.
Using JPEG for photos
JPEG stands for the Joint Photographic Experts Group, an organization of
companies and academic institutions around the world. The JPEG format is
designed for continuous tone images that contain a nearly unlimited range of
colors and shades of grey.
JPEG is a 24-bit format, giving it a color depth of 2 to the 24th power — or
16,777,215 maximum colors. This compression method is designed to favor
changes in brightness and contrast over changes in color hue, an approach
Figure 6-16:
The GIF
format is
best for
logos,
cartoons,
and other
images that
use only a
few colors.
101
Chapter 6: Creating and Editing Images for the Web

that mimics the limitations of our own eyes. Unlike GIF, JPEG uses a compres-
sion method that removes information from the image, but it does so in a
clever way, taking advantage of the fact that most of us are better at noticing
brightness and contrast differences than minute changes in color tone.
Because JPEG compression removes data from a file it’s called a lossy com-
pression method. The challenge with JPEGs is to compress them as much as
possible without losing too much quality. In the optimizing section that fol-
lows, you see how the Save for Web dialog box makes it easy to compare the
effects of compression settings until you have the best balance of size and
quality for your Web image.
The second letter in the JPEG acronym — P for Photographic — is a telling clue
as to what types of images are best saved in this format. JPEGs are preferred
for photographs, photo-realistic images, and any graphics that use millions of
colors and lots of color gradation, or shades of gray, like the image shown in
Figure 6-17.
Understanding PNG
PNG, like GIF, uses a lossless compression method. It also has both 8-bit and
24-bit options. The 8-bit version is comparable to GIF in producing quality
images with low file sizes. PNG can often produce slightly large files, but only
by a kilobyte or two.
Unfortunately, the 24-bit version of PNG doesn’t compete well against JPEG.
Because the PNG compression method is lossless (removing no additional
data from the image), files optimized in the 24-bit format are typically double
the size than when optimized in the JPEG format. This format is not widely
used on the Internet and I generally recommend you stick with GIFs or JPEGs
for your images.

Optimizing Images for the Web 
The process of optimizing an image for the Web involves several steps, all of
which can affect the appearance of an image as well as its file size. To help
you sort through these settings to find the best combination for your images,
Elements includes a special dialog box just for converting images for the Web.
Make sure you do your cropping, editing, and resizing before you use the Save
for Web dialog box. You get better results when you edit an image at the high-
est quality.
In the Save for Web dialog box, you can preview your image and select your
optimization settings, choosing the format, amount of compression, and
color options. To display the Save for Web dialog box, open any image in
Elements and choose File➪Save for Web.
The dialog is broken into separate panes so you can compare your original
image (on the left) with the optimized results (on the right) to decide which
settings give the best results. Below the original image, you see its file name
and file size. Below the optimized image, you see the effects of the optimiza-
tion settings and the new file size and estimated download time.
Download time is calculated by using an estimated Internet connection. You
can change the setting by right-clicking the file size and optimization time text.
This displays the Preview pop-up menu, shown in Figure 6-18, from which you
can select the access speed of your choice. (These days most people have at
least a 56K modem, so I prefer that setting.)
Optimizing GIF images
If you’re working with a graphic, such as a logo, a cartoon character, or some
other drawing that has less than 256 total colors, you should use the GIF
options in the Save for Web dialog box and reduce the colors as much as pos-
sible. To help make up for the degradation in image quality that can happen
when colors are removed, GIF uses a trick called dithering. Dithering involves
alternating pixels in a checkerboardlike pattern to create subtle color varia-
tions, even with a limited color palette. The effect can smooth the edges in an
image and make it appear that the image uses more colors.
103
Chapter 6: Creating and Editing Images for the Web

To convert an image to a GIF with the Save for Web dialog box, follow these
steps:
1. Open the image that you want to use on your Web site in the Editor
window of Photoshop Elements.
Choose File➪Open, locate the photo on your hard drive, and double-
click to open it.
2. Choose File➪Save For Web.
The Save For Web dialog box appears.
3. In the Optimized File Format list, choose GIF.
GIF is the preferred image format for line art, such as a logo shown in
Figure 6-19.
4. Set the number of colors in the Colors box.
The fewer colors you use, the smaller the file size and the faster the image
will download. For an even smaller file size, reduce the number to 4 or 8,
but be careful. The ideal number depends on your image; if you go too far,
you’ll adversely affect the image’s appearance.

5. Click the Transparency box if you want to maintain a transparent area
in your image.
Any area of the image that was transparent when you created the image
in the editor appears transparent in the preview window. If you don’t
have a transparent area in your image, this setting will have no effect.
Transparency is a good trick for making text or another part of an image
appear to float on a Web page because the transparent background
won’t display on the Web page. You can select transparency as a back-
ground option in the New File dialog box when you create an image.
6. Leave the other settings unchanged.
Unless you have a lot of experience with creating images for the Web,
leave the remaining settings unchanged and trust that Elements has
made the best choices for you.
7. Click OK.
The Save Optimized As dialog box opens.
8. Enter a name for the image and save it into the images folder in your
Web site folder.
9. Repeat these steps for each image you want to prepare for your site.

Chapter 6: Creating and Editing Images for the Web

Trial and error is a great technique in the Save for Web dialog box. In Fig-
ure 6-19, for example, I reduced the image to only two colors to see what it
would look like and to show you that the preview window provides a good
way to test your settings. (Don’t reduce your images as dramatically as I did
in the example.) As you can see in the preview image on the right, reducing
the image to only two colors made the text almost unreadable because it
removed the black that was used in the lettering. When I increased the setting
to eight colors, it looked fine and was still only 2.1KB, so that’s the setting I
finally saved it in.
Optimizing JPEG images
If you have an image with lots of colors, such as a photograph or a highly
complex drawing or painting, convert it to the JPEG format. This format is
ideal for optimizing continuous tone images and is capable of supporting
some 16.7 million colors.
With JPEGs, instead of choosing a number of colors, you choose how much
compression should be applied, a process that removes data to make the
image smaller. In the Save for Web dialog box in Elements, you can compare
compression levels on the same image and see how the quality is affected.
Essentially, the lower the quality of the image, the faster it will download.
However, don’t go too low or the image won’t look like much when it’s
viewed.
If you have a digital photograph or another image that you want to prepare
for the Web, follow these steps to optimize and save it:
1. Open the photograph that you want to use on your Web site.
Choose File➪Open, locate the photo on your hard drive, and double-
click to open it.
2. Choose File➪Save For Web.
The Save for Web dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-20.
3. In the Optimized File Format list, choose JPEG.
JPEG is the preferred image format for photographs and other multicol-
ored images.
4. Set the compression quality.
Use the preset options: Low, Medium, High, Very High, or Maximum from
the pull-down list. Or use the slider in the Quality field to make more
precise adjustments. Lowering the quality reduces the file size and
makes the image download more quickly.
106
Part II: Lookin’ Good: Images and Design 

Elements uses a compression scale of 0 to 100 for JPEG, with 0 the lowest
possible quality (the highest amount of compression and the smallest file
size) and 100 the highest possible quality (the least amount of compres-
sion and the biggest file size). You can use the slider in the dialog box to
make smaller adjustments until you reach the best balance between image
quality and file size.
I prefer to change compression levels manually, as described in Step 4,
because I like being able to make minute adjustments to get the best 
balance of quality and file size. If you prefer a quick fix, use the Preset
pull-down list. The three JPEG options — Low, Medium, and High —
automatically sets compression to 10, 30, and 60, respectively.
5. Leave the other settings unchanged.
Unless you have a lot of experience with creating images for the Web, let
Elements make the choices for you.
6. Click OK.
The Save Optimized As dialog box opens.
7. Enter a name for the image and save it into the images folder in your
Web site folder.
8. Repeat these steps for each image you want to prepare for your site.

Chapter 6: Creating and Editing Images for the Web

Creating Banners and Buttons
You can enter text directly into a Web page and format text with any font on
your computer. Unfortunately, for the text to display in the font you desire,
that font has to be on your user’s computer also. Using text on a Web page
works fine when you aren’t too concerned about the font or you’re using
common fonts, such as Times or Arial, but if you want to create beautifully
designed banners with more unusual fonts, such as Papyrus (shown in Fig-
ures 6-21 and 6-22), you’re better off creating a banner or button as an image.
That way, you can guarantee that your text will display on a visitor’s computer
exactly as it did when you created it. You can also use colored backgrounds,
or even images as backgrounds, as shown in the examples in this section.
Why not create all the text for your Web pages as images? For one thing, it
takes a lot more time to create images than to just type your text into a page
in a program such as FrontPage. But more important, images take longer to
download than text. You should use this trick sparingly and save it for text
that really matters, such as the banners at the top of your pages or the but-
tons that you use to navigate your site.
Before you start creating a banner or button, select the color you want for
the background in the default foreground and background box at the bottom
of the toolbox (labeled in Figure 6-2). When you create a new file, you can
apply only the Background color choice.
To create a button or banner graphic for your Web pages, follow these steps:
1. If it’s not already open, launch Photoshop Elements.
2. Choose File➪New➪Blank File.
The New dialog box appears.
3. In the Name box, enter a name for the button or banner.
4. Specify the width and height.
If you’re creating a banner graphic, most Web designers recommend that
you create a banner that is 700 pixels or less wide because it will display
well on most computer screens at that size. If you’re creating a button,
consider making it 150 to 300 pixels wide, depending on the design of
your page. In Figure 6-21, I created an image that is 200 by 80 pixels.
The height of your banner and buttons can be anything you like, but
remember you’re using up real estate on your page, and the bigger you
make these images the longer they take to download.
5. Set the resolution to 72 pixels/inch.
If you’re creating an image for print, you should use a much higher reso-
lution. When you’re creating an image for the Web, however, the graphic
will be viewed on a computer monitor, and most computer monitors 
108
Part II: Lookin’ Good: Images and Design 

display only 72 pixels/inch. The more pixels, the larger the file size and
the longer the file takes to download.
6. If you haven’t already set the background color (see the tip preceding
this set of steps), specify the color now.
Your options are White, Background Color (which uses the background
color selected in the toolbox), or Transparent (which creates an image
with no background). The Transparent option is a good choice if you
want your words to look like they float on a page. (Don’t worry if you
haven’t preselected the color you want for the background color; you
can change it in Step 12.)
7. Click OK.
The blank image is created with the background color specified in Step 6.
8. Select the text tool in the Tools palette.
9. Use the text formatting options in the options bar at the top of the
screen to specify the font face, size, style, and color.
10. Click to insert your cursor on the new blank image, and begin typing
to enter the text you want on your button or banner.
If you want to change the font or other text formatting options after you
add text to an image, make sure the text tool is selected from the Tools
palette, click and highlight to select the text you want to change, and
then make an adjustments in the options bar at the top of the screen.

11. If the Layers palette is not already open, choose Window➪Layers.
Notice that the text appears on its own layer, separate from the back-
ground of the image, unless you created a transparent background,
which is not treated as a separate layer.
12. Edit the background and the text layers independently.
Click a layer to select it. For example, if you want to change the back-
ground color, select the background layer and choose Edit➪Fill. In the
Fill Layer dialog box, use the pull-down menu in the Use box to specify
the background color (the color represented by the swatches at the
bottom of the toolbox). A transparent background can’t be edited inde-
pendently, so you can’t fill it with a color without affecting the text, but
you can edit the text without altering the transparent background.
13. Choose File➪Save For Web.
The Save for Web dialog box appears.
14. In the Optimized File Format list, choose GIF.
GIF is the best format for images that use only a few colors, such as
logos or banners.
15. Set the number in the Colors box.
Limiting the number of colors helps reduce the file size and make the
image download more quickly. For an even smaller file size, reduce this
number as much as you can without affecting the appearance of the
image too adversely.
16. Save the button or banner and give it a new name.
Repeat these steps for each button or banner you want to create.
Make sure you save the original Photoshop Elements image as well as the
optimized GIF or JPEG image you create for the Web. When you save an image
for the Web, the layers are compressed. If you keep the original, layered
image, you can make changes later more easily.
As you see in Figure 6-22, you can also create banners or buttons by inserting
text over a photograph. Simply open an existing image, and follow Steps 4
through 15. If you use a photograph, also change Step 13 to save your image
as a JPEG and Step 14 to specify your preferred compression option instead
of reducing the number of colors.

Organizing Images and Creating
Photo Albums and Galleries
In This Chapter
 Working with the Organizer
 Viewing your organized images
 Creating photo albums and Web galleries
I
f your household is anything like mine, you have a few catchall areas, where
things accumulate without much order. Among these, you probably have a
drawer or box full of photos and other memorabilia you’ve been intending to
arrange in a photo album or scrapbook. Often, it seems you don’t even realize
how disorganized you are until you need a particular photo, drawing, or clip-
ping and can’t find it.
If you’re tired of digging around boxes and opening every folder on your
hard drive when you want to find an image, you’ll appreciate the features in
Photoshop Elements 3 that make it easier to keep track of images and turn
folders full of digital pictures into well-designed photo album pages and Web
galleries.
In addition to being a great photo editing program, Elements 3 includes a fea-
ture called Organizer. In the first part of this chapter, you discover how to
create catalogs and collections of digital photos, drawings, and scanned doc-
uments with Organizer so you can find them more easily in the future. In the
second part of this chapter, you find instructions for using the creation tools
in Elements 3 to build photo album pages and Web photo galleries that you
can add to your Web site.

Getting Organized
Elements has three main work areas:
 Editor, where you resize and alter images (covered in Chapter 6)
 Organizer, where you select images and organize them in catalogs and
collections
 Creator, where you can use automated tools to create a variety of proj-
ects, including photo albums, calendars, and Web galleries
In the following sections, I cover Organizer and Creator with a series of 
exercises that begin with selecting images in Organizer and culminate in a
complete Web photo gallery generated by Creator. (Photo galleries are ideal
additions to sites like the ones you can create with the templates in Chap-
ters 11 through 14.)
Starting Organizer
Knowing where your images are is an important first step to creating any
image project. Taking time to get your photos and other images into collec-
tions before you start creating projects such as photo albums will save you
time later and help ensure you have all your images handy, even if they come
from different sources.
You can open Elements’ Organizer window in a couple of ways. The simplest
way is to select View and Organize Photos on the Welcome screen (see Fig-
ure 7-1), which appears when you first launch Elements. To open Organizer
from the Editor window, click the Photo Browser icon at the top of the screen.
If you’ve already opened Elements, you can start Organizer by clicking the
Photo Browser button on the shortcuts bar, as shown in Figure 7-2. Opening
the Organizer can take a few seconds, so be patient.
Touring the Organizer workspace
Before you begin using Organizer, it’s a good idea to take some time and get
to know the environment. At the top of the screen is the title bar, which tells
you that you’re in the Organizer (see Figure 7-3). Below that are some familiar
menus, including File and Edit.

Chapter 7: Organizing Images and Creating Photo Albums and Galleries

On the right side of the workspace in Photo Browser, you see two tabs
labeled Tags and Collections (these are not available from Date view):
 The Tags tab features six categories: Favorites, Hidden, People, Places,
Events, and Other, for images that defy categorization.
 The Collections tab enables you to view the images you’ve collected and
stored in named groups by using the organizational options, described
in the following section.
In the top-right corner is the Help box, where you can type a question and
press Enter (or click the little question mark button) to query the help files.
Just below the Help field, you find two icons that enable you to control how
your images are displayed in the Organizer: Photo Browser and Date View. If
you prefer to organize your images according to when they were taken, you’ll
like Date view, as shown in Figure 7-4. If you prefer to organize images accord-
ing to what they contain, the main Photo Browser window (refer to Figure 7-3)
is your best choice. Note that not all the Organizer options are available in
Date view.

Part II: Lookin’ Good: Images and Design 

Gathering Your Images
Elements offers a number of ways to group and organize images. You start with
a catalog, Adobe’s name for its system for managing images. As you create a
catalog, Elements gathers information about each image (including its file
name, location on your computer, size, and date) and stores the information
in a database. Elements doesn’t actually move your images anywhere; it just
records their location on your system and stores other relevant information
about them to help you keep track of images and create projects in the future.
You can further organize your images into collections, which makes it easier
to select only the pictures you like best from a large group. You can create a
collection by choosing specific images from multiple catalogs, or a subcate-
gory of a catalog. For example, if you take 100 pictures at a family reunion,
you probably want to show about 10 or 20 of them to family and friends. By
gathering images into a collection, you can easily select a subset of images
from a catalog or a group of catalogs and then use them to make a creation,
such as a Web gallery (covered in the “Creating a Web gallery” section at the
end of this chapter).

Chapter 7: Organizing Images and Creating Photo Albums and Galleries

Creating a catalog
To help you stay organized, you can create different catalogs for different
groups of photos. You can also create collections within a catalog, as you see
in the following section. The first step is creating a catalog.
Follow these steps to create a catalog in Elements:
1. With the Organizer window open in Elements, choose File➪Catalog.
A prompt appears, as shown in Figure 7-5 with the New, Open, Save As,
and Recover buttons.
2. Click the New button to start a new catalog.
The New Catalog dialog box opens.
3. In the File Name box, type a name for the catalog.
You can call the catalog anything you want, but it’s helpful to make it
something you’ll remember so you can keep track of multiple catalogs. I
like to use descriptive names, such as Jenny’s Wedding or New House.
4. Click Save.
The catalog is created and opened, ready for you to add photos.
Follow these steps to add your photos to the catalog:
1. To open a catalog, choose File➪Catalog and then click the Open button.
If you have just created a catalog, it should be open and empty in
Organizer.
Figure 7-5:

116
Part II: Lookin’ Good: Images and Design 

2. Choose File➪Get Photos.
You can select images from a camera, a scanner, a folder on your com-
puter, or a mobile phone — or by searching if you don’t know the location
of the images. The search option lets you quickly identify images on any
available hard drive, CD, or other storage device connected to your
system.
You can always add more images after a catalog is created. This is a
good way to retrieve images from different places on your computer
system or from different storage devices. Each time you add more
photos, you can choose from the full list of options, including From
Camera, From Scanner, and From Files and Folders. However, if you add
images from a removable storage device, such as a memory card or a
CD, that source will have to be inserted into the computer when you
want to retrieve those images again.
3. To add images that are already on your computer, choose From Files
and Folders.
The Get Photos from Files and Folders dialog box opens.
4. Navigate around your hard drive to find the folder containing the
photos, and then click the folder name or the names of the individual
files you want to select.
You can click and drag to select multiple images, or use Ctrl-click (on a
PC) or Ô-Click (on a Mac) to select nonconsecutive images. If you select
a folder name, all the images in the folder are added to the catalog.
If you’re using Windows, you can choose how you want to display your
files in the Get Photos from Files and Folders dialog box to make it easier
to identify the images you want to add to your catalog. In Figure 7-6, I
selected the Thumbnails option, which displays small versions of the
images so I can see what they look like. Use the List option if you prefer
to view your images by file name, or use Details to see the creation date,
size, and file type. These options are available from any folder on your
system and from all the dialog boxes you use to open or get images in
Elements.
5. Click the Get Photos button.
The images you selected are added to your open catalog and are dis-
played in the work area, as shown in Figure 7-7.
6. To add more images, repeat Steps 2 through 5.
When you add additional images to an existing catalog, the new images are
displayed in their own window when you click Get Photos. To view the entire
catalog, click the Back to All Photos button at the top of the work area.

Part II: Lookin’ Good: Images and Design 

Want to see larger thumbnails of your images in Photo Browser? Click and
drag the slider (located in the lower-right corner of the work area) to make
the images larger or smaller.
Creating collections
One of the best ways to further organize your images is to create collections
within your catalogs. You can create as many collections as you want within
each catalog. Collections can be used to create a variety of projects, such as
calendars and photo albums.
The first step is to create a collection and give it a name. Follow these steps:
1. With the Organizer open in Elements, click the Collections tab.
2. Click the New button.
3. In the drop-down list, choose New Collection to create a single 
collection.
The New Collection Group option in the list lets you organize multiple
collections into a group that can be managed collectively.
4. In the Create Collection dialog box, enter a name for the collection.
You can call your collection anything you like, but it’s always good prac-
tice to use a descriptive name that will help you identify its contents
later, such as “Photos of dad acting goofy.” In the example shown in
Figure 7-8, I created separate collections for three groups of images and
named them Halloween, New House, and Nieces.
If you want to assign your new collection to an existing collection group,
use the Group pull-down list to make the association. You can also add
notes in this dialog box to describe the collection.
5. Click OK.
The collection is created and its name is added to the list of collections
in the Collections tab.
6. Add your images to the collection.
Drag an image from the open catalog in the Organizer work area and
drop it on the collection name in the Collections panel. Or right-click an
image, choose Add to Collection, and select the name of the collection
from the drop-down list. Collections are automatically saved and associ-
ated with the catalog.
119
Chapter 7: Organizing Images and Creating Photo Albums and Galleries

Assigning tags to identify images
After your images are in a catalog, you keep track of and prioritize them by
assigning tags to them. To assign a tag, simply right-click an image in the
Organizer window, choose Attach Tag, and then select from a list of cate-
gories and subcategories. For example, if you choose People, as I have in the
example in Figure 7-9, you can then further categorize the image as Friend or
Family. You can create as many categories and subcategories as you like. In
the example, I created a subcategory called Warner Family.
To create a category or subcategory, click the arrow next to New at the top of
the Collections tab, enter a name in the Create Category or Create Subcategory
dialog box, and specify any relevant associations. For example, when I created
the Warner Family subcategory, I associated it with the Family subcategory of
the People category.
Elements then lets you view images in groups based on any category or sub-
category. For example, if you click the People option in the Tags tab, all
images tagged as People appear in the work area. If you choose Family,
only images tagged as People with the subcategory Family are shown.

120
Part II: Lookin’ Good: Images and Design 

The Star options (shown in the list in Figure 7-9) are for rating images. For
example, you can tag all your best pictures from all your family gatherings
with 5 stars and then view only images with 5 stars to see all your best shots
at once.
You can even use tags in combination. For example, you can tag photos to
identify them as Family photos and rank them with star ratings. Then you can
search for only your best family images.
Creating Photo Albums 
and Web Galleries
After all the organizing in the first half of this chapter, it’s time for the fun
part, turning those images into a photo album or Web gallery so you can
show them off to family and friends. After all, what good are all those great
pictures if you keep them hidden on your computer’s hard drive?

Chapter 7: Organizing Images and Creating Photo Albums and Galleries

This is where Element’s Creator features come in. The Create button is on the
shortcuts bar at the top of the screen in both the Organizer and Editor views
in Elements. When you click the Create button, the Creation Setup window
opens, as shown in Figure 7-10, and you can choose from a list of Creation
types, including Photo Album Pages, Postcards and Wall Calendar.
In this section, you find step-by-step instructions for creating a photo album
and a Web photo gallery. The Postcard and Wall Calendar options are best
suited for creating designs that will be printed, so I don’t cover them in this
book. If you want to add a calendar to your Web site, try one of the online 
calendar services featured in Appendix A, such as the free calendars at 
calendar.yahoo.com.
Creating a photo album
When you create a photo album in Elements, you organize your images onto
pages that can be printed or saved as a PDF file and attached to an e-mail
message or linked to a Web site.

You can’t create a photo album until you have created a catalog (a good first
step to organizing your images anyway). The instructions in the “Gathering
Your Images” section, earlier in this chapter, show you how to create catalogs
and collections.
To create a photo album, follow these steps:
1. Click the Create button or choose File➪New➪Creation.
After a few seconds, the Creation Setup window appears.
2. In the Select a Creation Type list, double-click Photo Album Pages.
The Create Photo Album Pages wizard opens.
3. Specify the style of your album and choose from a list of options:
a. Click to select the style you want to use for your photo album.
The panel on the right side of the window features a long list of
style choices, with thumbnail samples of each option. If you click
the style name once, you can view a sample of the style in the main
portion of the window, as shown in Figure 7-11.

6. In the Create Photo Album Pages window, click and drag to change
the order in which your photos will appear in the album, and then
click Next Step.
Note that each image thumbnail (one for each image that you added
to the album) has a page number. You can use your mouse to drag the
thumbnails to another position in the album. As you drag, a vertical line
follows your mouse, indicating the location where the image will end up
when you release the mouse button.
7. In the Customize window, double-click the title area to edit the text,
and then click Done.
Replace the words Double-click to Insert Title with your caption, and use
the options in the dialog box to specify the font, size, alignment, and
style of the title text. In the example shown in Figure 7-13, I’ve changed
the title to Our Family Tree.

8. Use the View Page pull-down list at the top of the Customize window
to view and edit the pages in your photo album, and then click Next
Step.
You can edit a caption on your album pages, just as you edited the title
on the first page, by double-clicking the caption area and using the
options in the Caption dialog box to specify the font, size, alignment,
and style of the text. You can write captions as long as you like, but if
you want your images to appear on one page, limit yourself to no more
than a sentence or two for each image.
9. In the Album Pages Name box, name your album and then click Save.
You can type a name or use the title page for the name by clicking the
Use Title for Name option.
10. In the Share window, click to select the option that corresponds to
what you want to do with your album.
Your options are as follows:
• Create a PDF: Shown in Figure 7-14, this option saves your album
in portable document format (PDF), a common format for sharing
documents on the Internet. If you choose this option, you are
prompted with three quality options. Optimize for Viewing
Onscreen makes the PDF file as small as possible (the best option
if you want to e-mail your photo album or add it to a Web page).
Optimize for Printing is the best option if you want to print your
file (you can e-mail a PDF at this quality setting, but it will take
longer to download). Use Full Resolution if you want to leave your
images untouched.
• Print: This option opens the Print dialog box, where you can spec-
ify how you want to print your pages.
• E-mail: This option creates a PDF file and also automates the
process of sending that PDF file as an attachment to an e-mail mes-
sage. When you select E-mail option, the Attach Creation Items to
E-mail dialog box opens, and you can enter the e-mail address of
Figure 7-14:
You can
save your

PDF file.
126
Part II: Lookin’ Good: Images and Design 

the person you want to send the album to and specify the quality
you want for your images. (Unless you and the person you are
sending the photo album to both have fast Internet connections,
choose the Optimize for Viewing on a Screen option so that the file
will download more quickly.) Elements takes care of everything: It
creates a PDF file of your album, launches your e-mail program,
composes a message to the address you entered, and attaches the
PDF file to the message. All you have to do is add a personal mes-
sage to the e-mail and click the Send button.
11. When you’re finished, click Done.
Elements saves your creation.
PDF, which stands for Portable Document Format, is a common format for
documents that contain text or graphics and is especially useful when you
want to preserve formatting. You can add a PDF file to a Web page as you
would to any other page in your Web site — by creating a link. (You can find
instructions for creating links in Chapter 8.)
If you want to use your PDF file on your Web site, make sure to give it a Web-
friendly name, meaning don’t use special characters or spaces. To view a PDF
file, your visitors must have Adobe Acrobat Reader, a free viewer that can be
easily downloaded from www.adobe.com and is now built into most Web
browsers.
Creating a Web gallery
One of my favorite features, the Web Photo Gallery option enables you to
quickly and easily design an online photo gallery that you can add to your
Web pages. Adobe Elements not only resizes your images and optimizes them
for the Web but also creates the HTML pages, inserts your images into them,
and links the pages. It’s an incredible timesaver, especially if you’re creating a
large photo gallery for your site.
Creating a Web gallery is similar to creating a photo album. You identify the
catalog or collection you want to use, select the images, and then make a few
formatting choices before saving your work.
If you want to make changes after you’ve created a gallery, you have to start
over and generate the gallery again. But don’t worry, this doesn’t take as long
as you may think because Elements saves your settings and generates new
galleries in a matter of seconds. You can always go back and re-create your
gallery, changing any of the settings to alter the final result. Each time you
create a Web gallery, Elements creates new copies of all your images and new
pages to display them on, according to the settings you specify in the Creation
Wizard.
127
Chapter 7: Organizing Images and Creating Photo Albums and Galleries

To create a Web gallery in Elements, follow these steps:
1. Open Photoshop Elements and choose File➪New➪Creation.
After a few seconds, the Creation Setup window appears.
2. In the Select a Creation Type list, double-click Web Photo Gallery.
The Adobe Web Photo Gallery dialog box appears, as shown in Fig-
ure 7-15.
3. At the top of the Photos area (on the left), click the Add button.
The Add Photos dialog box appears. If you started the Web photo
gallery wizard with a catalog open, the images are added automatically.
4. Use the options under Add Photos From to select the images you want
to include in your Web photo gallery, and then click OK.
The Add Photos dialog box closes and the Adobe Web Photo Gallery
window becomes visible again.
5. Specify formatting as follows:
• Gallery Style list: You can choose from a variety of layout designs,
such as Baby Boy and Space. To see what a style looks like, select
it from the pull-down list. A preview of the style is displayed at the
top of the dialog box. In the example in Figure 7-15, I selected the
Winter style.
Figure 7-15:

128
Part II: Lookin’ Good: Images and Design 

• Banner tab: The banner is the text that appears at the top of your
gallery pages. You can leave this option blank or fill in the boxes to
add a title, a subtitle, and an e-mail address (which automatically
creates an e-mail link to the specified address on all your pages).
You can also specify the font face and font size for the title and
subtitle text. Use the Destination Site Folder box at the bottom of
the dialog box to specify a name for your gallery, and browse to
choose where you want the files to be saved on your hard drive. If
you want to add the gallery to your Web site, I recommend that
you save the gallery in a subfolder within your Web site folder.
• Thumbnails tab: The settings on this tab affect the size and style
of the thumbnail images displayed on the gallery pages that
Elements creates. You can choose Small, Medium, Large, or Extra
large. As you generate your Web gallery, Elements creates a copy
of each of your images in the specified thumbnail size, leaving your
original images untouched. If you’re not sure what size you want,
try Medium; you can always change your mind later and generate a
new Web gallery with thumbnails in another size.
At the bottom of the Thumbnails tab are options for captions you
might want to appear with your images. Specify the font face and
size and then choose what you want Elements to use to generate
the text for your caption. Your options are Filename, which adds
captions based on the name of the image file, Date, which inserts
the creation or save date of the image, and Caption, which inserts
caption text you added to the General image properties. (You open
the Image Properties dialog box by right-clicking an image in the
Organizer and choosing Show Properties). You can select any com-
bination of these options.
• Large Photos tab: When a visitor clicks a thumbnail-sized image on
the main page of the photo gallery, a new page with a larger photo
appears in its stead — in whatever size you specify here. You can
also adjust the image quality by dragging the slider. (The lower the
quality, the faster the image will download.) The Caption options
are the same as those described for the Thumbnails tab.
• Custom Colors tab: You can change the colors of the text and
pages in your gallery by using the color pickers next to each
option: Background, Banner, Text, Link, Active Link, and Visited
Link. For best results, use light-colored text on a dark background
or dark text on a light background.
6. When you’ve specified the settings and format options for your Web
photo gallery, click Save to create it.
Elements creates your Web photo gallery and displays the pages in
the Elements viewer. The viewer mimics a Web browser, as shown in
Figure 7-16.
129
Chapter 7: Organizing Images and Creating Photo Albums and Galleries

When creating a Web photo gallery, which takes remarkably few seconds,
Elements creates copies of all your selected images, converts them to JPEG
format, and saves them as thumbnails and as larger images. Then Elements
does something most image programs couldn’t dream of — it creates HTML
pages and links everything for you.
When the gallery is completed, it includes a main HTML page (or pages,
depending on how many images you selected), which displays the thumbnail
images in the style you chose in the creation wizard. Each thumbnail is linked
to a different page, which displays the larger version of that image. To view a
Web gallery on your own computer, open any of the pages with a Web browser
by choosing File➪Open and finding the main page of the gallery site, which
should be called index.html.
After the photo gallery folder is generated (with whatever name you entered),
it contains three subfolders named images, pages, and thumbnails. You can
add a Web photo gallery to any Web site by saving or copying the folder and
its subfolders (with all the images, thumbnails, and pages) into your Web site
folder (the folder I recommend you create to hold all the images and pages of
your entire Web site).
You can open any of the HTML files in the pages folder with a Web design
program such as FrontPage or Dreamweaver to edit them further. You find
instructions for editing pages and creating links in FrontPage in Chapter 8.

n Part III you discover how easy it is to build Web pages,
work with templates, and add sound, video, and anima-
tion. Beginning in Chapter 8, you find an introduction to
Microsoft FrontPage 2003, a Web design program that makes
creating a new site almost as easy as creating a document
in Microsoft Word. Chapter 9 explains the various ways
you can create and use templates in FrontPage 2003, and
Chapter 10 provides an overview of the many multimedia
formats in use on the Internet today and instructions for
adding audio, video, and more to your Web pages.

C
onsidered the most popular Web design program for people who are
not professional designers, FrontPage 2003 combines a familiar interface
(it looks a lot like Microsoft Word) with sophisticated tools. You can use
FrontPage to build a simple Web site or a complex one, even if you’re new to
the world of the Web.
FrontPage 2003 can help you with every aspect of Web development, from
creating pages, to setting and correcting links, to publishing your pages on a
Web server. In this chapter, you get an introduction to this Web design pro-
gram, an overview of some of the most important features, and step-by-step
instructions for creating a simple Web page.
The features covered in this chapter can be applied to your work whether
you’re creating a custom page or using predesigned templates, such as the
ones featured in Chapters 11 through 14, and want to edit or add to a page
design. In the next chapter, you find a guide to using and creating templates
in FrontPage.

Introducing the Many Components
of FrontPage 2003
FrontPage can be overwhelming at first, with its many features, menu items,
and display options. To help you get familiar with the program, this section
introduces you to the interface and provides an overview of the basic func-
tions of FrontPage. In the sections that follow, you find out how to create a
page in FrontPage, add text, insert an image, and even create links.
Starting with the workspace
You have more than one option for creating Web pages in FrontPage. You can
 Create a blank page
 Edit an existing page
 Use one of the many FrontPage templates or themes
 Load your own template (from this book’s CD or a number of other
sources)
If you choose to create a blank page, FrontPage starts a new blank HTML
page in the main workspace. The workspace consists of a main window that
shows the page you’re working on and menus and toolbars across the top of
the screen. Figure 8-1 shows the FrontPage workspace with a blank HTML
page open. You can type text directly onto a page in the workspace and apply
basic formatting, such as bold and italics as you would in a program like
Microsoft Word.
Figure 8-1:
The
FrontPage
workspace
includes a

window, a
menu bar,
and optional
toolbars.
134
Part III: Creating Web Pages and Adding Multimedia 

The big, open area in the main area of the workspace is the document window,
which is where you work on new and existing pages. Four display options are
accessible through small icons at the bottom left of the screen: Design, Split,
Code, and Preview. You can switch from one display setting to another by
clicking the respective icon at the bottom of the page.
You can choose from the following four display options in the FrontPage
workspace:
 Design view: By default, FrontPage presents new pages in Design view,
which displays the page much as it would appear in a Web browser,
except links are not functional. To select Design view, click the Design icon
at the bottom left of the screen (this is the option selected in Figure 8-1).
 Preview: If you want to test your links, click the Preview icon. The work-
space is transformed to function like Microsoft’s Web browser, Internet
Explorer.
 Code view: If you want to see the HTML code behind the page, click the
Code icon to change to Code view. If you’re not accustomed to looking at
programming code, the page may look like hieroglyphics.
 Split view: If you want to find out how to read or write HTML, try the
Split view, which enables you to see HTML code in both Code and
Design views simultaneously, as shown in Figure 8-2.
Pages viewed on the Web may not always look exactly the way they do in
FrontPage because not all browsers support the same HTML features or dis-
play them exactly the same way. For best results, always test your work in a
variety of Web browsers and on different computers. The best way to make
sure that your pages are displayed consistently on different machines (such
as your cousin’s Macintosh or your grandfather’s 8-year-old computer) is to
simplify the design.

Chapter 8: Working with Microsoft FrontPage

Meandering through the menu options
FrontPage has many menu options that probably look familiar, especially if you
use other Microsoft products such as Microsoft Word. Click the File menu and
you’ll find the same Save and Print options you’d find in Word. You’ll also find a
few new options, such as Open Site, which enables you to open an entire Web
site rather than just a single page, and Preview in Browser, which enables you
to open the page you are working on in a Web browser to see how the page will
appear on the Web.
The Edit menu contains the well-known Cut, Copy, and Paste options, plus
some new ones. For example, the Check In and Check Out options are helpful
if you’re working with a team of developers; when someone is working on a
page on the Web site, these options keep track so that no one else overwrites
that person’s work.
The View menu provides access to some helpful design features, such as
grids and rulers, which you can use as guides when designing a page. The
Tracing Image option enables you to insert an image into the background
of a page and use it to guide your design work. Many professional designers
use this feature to create a design in a program such as Photoshop and then
re-create the design in FrontPage for the Web.
The Task Pane option opens a pane on the side of the workspace, as shown in
Figure 8-3. The task pane gives you easy access to help files, as well as links to
training information, online discussion areas, and recommended downloads.
As you get started working with FrontPage, take a few minutes to click the
other menu options. For example, the Format menu provides font, number-
ing, and bullet options, and the Tools menu is where you’ll find spell check.

pane, on the
right side of

Part III: Creating Web Pages and Adding Multimedia 

If you’re not sure what an option does, you can look it up quickly in the
FrontPage Help features, available in the task pane (use the Ctrl+F1 shortcut
for quick access).
Toddling across the toolbars
At the top of the screen in the standard interface, you’ll find the standard and
formatting toolbars. In FrontPage, as in word processing programs, these two
toolbars hold the most commonly used features, such as bold, italics, and
alignment options. To add or remove a toolbar, choose View➪Toolbars and
select an option. The Pictures toolbar, for example, provides quick access to
many of the program’s image formatting features.
The Insert Table, Insert Layer, and Insert Picture icons are located on the
standard toolbar, which appears at the top of the work area. In Figure 8-4, I
used the Insert Picture icon to add a photo to a Web page. (Special thanks to
Chris and Natalie, as well as photographer Jessica Verma, for letting me fea-
ture their photos in this chapter.) You find detailed instructions for adding
images in the “Adding an image” section later in this chapter.

Chapter 8: Working with Microsoft FrontPage

Before You Create or Edit Pages
When you work with a program such as FrontPage, you create your Web pages
on your own computer and then transfer them to a Web server when you’re
ready to publish them on the Web.
To ensure that your Web pages and related files transfer correctly to the
server, it’s important to store all the files for your Web site in one main folder
on your computer. That’s because links are created based on where pages,
images, and other files are in relation to each other. You can create subfold-
ers within the main folder to better organize your files, but just make sure
that everything is stored within one main folder before you start creating
links or inserting images.
FrontPage includes special site management features to help you organize
your Web site, but these features work only after you have identified your
main Web site folder in FrontPage. In this section, I describe three ways you
can open an existing Web site or create a site in FrontPage.
When you create files or subfolders in a Web site, it’s important to name those
files and folders without any spaces or special characters. But when you create
the main folder for your Web site, you can name it anything you like because
the main folder is used to store your site only on your hard drive and won’t be
transferred to the Web server when you publish your Web site. For more tips
on naming files in a Web site, see Chapter 2.
Opening an existing site in FrontPage
If you want to edit an existing Web site in FrontPage or are using one of the
predesigned template sites featured in Chapters 11 through 14, you should
first open in FrontPage the main folder that contains your Web site files.
Follow these steps to open in FrontPage an existing Web site or one of the
predesigned templates from the CD:
1. Choose File➪Open Site.
The Open Site dialog box appears.
2. Navigate your hard drive until you locate the main folder of your
Web site.
3. Double-click to select the folder name.
4. Click Open.
Because your new folder was not created in FrontPage, a dialog box
appears, stating: “FrontPage needs to add information to your folder in
order to help manage your Hyperlinks and other Web site content.”
138
Part III: Creating Web Pages and Adding Multimedia 

5. Click Yes.
The Web site folder is opened and the files and subfolders in your main
site are displayed in the FrontPage work area (as shown in Figure 8-5).
Creating a Web site folder
Although you can create a site from within FrontPage, I prefer to create a new
main site folder myself on my hard drive and then open it in FrontPage. This
option enables me to save my Web site folder wherever I want to on my hard
drive, instead of being limited to the default folder FrontPage uses. FrontPage’s
site management features will work the same.
To create a Web site folder and then open it in FrontPage, follow these steps:
1. Create a folder on your hard drive as you’d create any new folder.
On a PC, you can choose File➪New Folder in Windows Explorer to create
a new folder anywhere on your hard drive. On a Mac, choose File➪New
Folder from within any existing folder. You can name the main folder of
your site anything you like, but I suggest using a name that means some-
thing to you, such as Baby Web Site.
Figure 8-5:
When
you open
a site in
FrontPage,

work area.
139
Chapter 8: Working with Microsoft FrontPage

2. In FrontPage, choose File➪Open Site.
The Open Site dialog box appears.
3. Navigate around your hard drive until you locate the new folder you
created for your Web site.
4. Double-click to select the folder name.
5. Click Open.
Because your new folder was not created in FrontPage, a dialog box
appears, stating: “FrontPage needs to add information to your folder in
order to help manage your Hyperlinks and other Web site content.”
6. Click Yes.
The Web site folder is opened and the files and subfolders in your main
site are displayed in the FrontPage work area (refer to Figure 8-5).
Creating a New Web Page
Whether you’re working on a new site or an existing one, after you’ve opened
your main site folder in FrontPage, you’re ready to create new pages.
To create a page in FrontPage, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪New. 
2. In the New task pane, select Blank Page, as shown in Figure 8-6. 
Many other features are accessible from the New task pane, such as templates
and Web package solutions, but don’t worry about those for now. In this
chapter, you create a simple HTML file. In Chapter 9, you find out how to
use predesigned templates and other automated features.
Creating a headline
Suppose that you want to center a headline and make it big and bold, such as
the one shown in Figure 8-7. Follow these steps:
1. Click to insert your cursor at the top of the blank page and type
some text.
Type anything you like — you just need something that you can format
so you can follow the formatting instructions in this section.
If you have text in a word processor or another program, you can copy
and paste that text into your FrontPage document.
140

2. Highlight the text you want to format.
3. On the formatting toolbar, do the following:
a. Click the Bold icon.
This icon and the others in this set of steps are labeled in Figure 8-7.
The heading becomes bold.

b. Click the Center icon.
The text is centered.
c. Use the Size pull-down menu and choose 36.
The text changes to font size 36.
Indenting text
If you want to add more text to your page, you can simply continue typing or
you can copy and paste to move text from a Word document or other file into
your Web page. To add more text to a page and indent the text, follow these
steps.
1. Press the Enter key to create a paragraph break.
To create a line break rather than a paragraph break, press Shift + Enter
(on a PC) or Shift + Return (on a Mac).
2. Type a little more text after your headline text.
A single sentence or a couple of short lines is enough.
3. Highlight the text you want to indent.
4. Choose Text➪Indent.
If you want to add more text that’s not indented, make sure no text is selected
and then choose Text➪Outdent to transition back to plain text mode. You can
also use the Increase and Decrease Indent buttons on the toolbar at the top of
the page.
Adding an image
Using FrontPage to add an image to your Web page is simple. The challenge is
to create a good-looking image that loads quickly in your viewer’s browser.
You need another program, such as Photoshop Elements or Fireworks, to
create and edit images. You find out more about editing images in Chapters 5
and 6, but for now, I assume that you have a GIF or JPEG image file ready to
load on your page.
The only image formats that will display on a Web page are GIF and JPEG. If
you don’t have an image handy for this next exercise, use one of the sample
image files on the CD-ROM.
142
Part III: Creating Web Pages and Adding Multimedia 

PNG is also an accepted image format on the Web, but Web designers rarely
use it because browsers do not support PNG as well as they support GIF and
JPEG.
Before you insert an image on your page, you should do two important tasks.
First, choose File➪Save to save your new HTML page in your Web site’s folder
on your hard drive (even if the page is still blank). This step is important
because FrontPage can’t properly set the link to your image until it identifies
the relative locations of the HTML page and the image. Until you save the
page, FrontPage doesn’t know what folder the page is in, so it won’t be able
to set the link properly.
For this same reason, the second task is to make sure that the image file is
stored in the same main folder you created for your Web site. Many designers
create a subfolder called images so that they can keep all their image files in
one place.
If you move the page or image to another folder on your hard drive after you
insert the image on your page, you risk breaking the link between the page
and the image, and an ugly broken image icon appears when you view your
page in a browser. If you want to move files and folders without breaking
links, make sure your site is open in FrontPage (as described in the “Before
You Create or Edit Pages” section) and make your changes from the Web site
folder view (refer to Figure 8-5).
If you do break a link to an image, you can correct it by clicking the broken
image icon and then clicking the Insert Picture icon on the standard toolbar
and selecting the image again.
Follow these steps to place an image on your Web page:
1. Click the Insert Picture icon on the standard toolbar (labeled in
Figure 8-4).
The Picture dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 8-8.
2. Navigate to the folder that has the image you want to insert.
3. Double-click to select the image you want.
The image appears on your Web page.
4. Double-click the image on your page.
The Picture Properties dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 8-9.
5. Specify image attributes, such as alignment, horizontal and vertical
spacing.
The Picture Properties dialog box enables you to specify many options
for how your images are displayed on your Web page. These various
options are described in Table 8-1.
6. Click OK to close the Picture Properties dialog box.

Alignment
Wraps text aligned to the right or left around the
image. The other options — Baseline, Top, and
Middle — control the horizontal alignment of text
or other objects next to the image.
Border Thickness
Adds a border, specified in pixels, around an
image. FrontPage makes 0 the default setting, so
if you don’t want a border you can ignore this
option. (I nearly always use 0.)
Horizontal Spacing
Inserts blank space, measured in pixels, to the
left and right of the image.
Vertical Spacing
Inserts blank space, measured in pixels, above
and below the image.
Width
Alters the width of the image in pixels or by a 
percentage. FrontPage automatically specifies
the width of the image based on the size of the
image file.
Height
Alters the height of the image in pixels or by a
percentage. FrontPage automatically specifies
the height of the image based on the size of the
image file.

Opens the image in an image editor.
Picture File Type Button
Opens the Picture File Type dialog box, where
you can specify the image format. Options are
GIF, JPEG, PNG-8, and PNG-24. If your image file
includes an extension, such as .jpeg or .gif,
you do not need to use this dialog box. (See
Chapter 2 for more on image extensions and
Chapter 6 for more on image formats.)
Low-Res
Inserts a second image in the same place on a
page. The low-resolution image loads first and is
then replaced by the primary image. This option
is useful when you have a large image file
because you can set a smaller image file (such
as a black-and-white version) as the Low-Res
image and it will display while the main image
downloads.
Text
Displays the words you enter only if the image
doesn’t appear on your viewer’s screen because
the viewer has images turned off or can’t view
images. Special browsers for the blind “read”
this text so visitors can identify images even if
they can’t see them.
Long Description
Inserts a longer text description in the code
behind your image.
Default Hyperlink Location
Displays the address or path if the image links to
another page. (For more about linking, see
“Setting Links” later in the chapter.)
Target Frame
Specifies where the page that you’re linking to
should open. This is important when you’re using
an HTML frameset or when you want a link to
open a new browser window.
The options in the Video tab do not apply to still images. For instructions on
adding video, see Chapter 10.
To resize an image in FrontPage, you can drag the edge of the image or change
the Height and Width values in the Picture Properties dialog, but those are not
the best methods. When you change the dimensions of the image in FrontPage,
146
Part III: Creating Web Pages and Adding Multimedia 

you change not the size of the image but the way it appears on the page. That’s
a bad idea because it distorts the image. In addition, if you use this method to
make the image smaller, you make your visitors download a larger file than 
necessary.
You’re always better off using an image editor, such as Photoshop Elements,
to change the physical size of an image. You find out how in Chapter 6.
Setting Links
Creating links on a Web page is much easier than most people imagine. After
you’ve opened or created a Web site in FrontPage, the Insert Hyperlink option
takes care of just about everything for you. FrontPage keeps track of the loca-
tions of your files and folders and inserts the necessary information to create
a link from one page to another or to any other file in your site. (If you haven’t
already opened your site in FrontPage, you find instructions for doing so in
the “Before You Create or Edit Pages” section, earlier in this chapter.)
If you’re creating a link to another Web site or to an e-mail address, you need
only the address; FrontPage takes care of the rest. This section includes
instructions for creating all three of these common kinds of links.
Linking pages within your Web site
Linking from one page to another page in your Web site is easy. The most
important things to remember are to save your pages before you start setting
links and to make sure that all your Web page files are in your main Web site
folder.
147
Chapter 8: Working with Microsoft FrontPage
Creating pages makes it easier to set links
When you start working on your family Web
site, consider creating a bunch of “holder”
pages right away. Doing so enables you to orga-
nize the structure of your site before you start
setting links. After all, you can’t link to a page
that doesn’t exist. If you plan to have, for exam-
ple, three main links on your front page to the
family history page, the baby page, and the
photo album, go ahead and create pages for
each of those sections, even if you don’t have
anything to put on them yet. With these initial
pages in place, you benefit from having an early
plan for organizing the site and can start setting
links among the main pages right away.

Here’s how you create a link to a page within your Web site:
1. In FrontPage, create a new page or open the page on which you want
to create a link.
Remember, always save the page you’re working on before you set links.
2. Select the text or image that you want to serve as the link.
That is, select the text or image that will open another page when a user
clicks it.
3. Click the Insert Hyperlink icon on the standard toolbar.
(The icon is labeled in Figure 8-4.) The Insert Hyperlink dialog box
appears.
4. Navigate around your hard drive to find the page to which you want
your image or text to link.
5. Click the file name to select the page, and then click OK.
The link is set and the dialog box closes. If you selected text, the words
appear underlined and in a different color. If you selected an image, you
will not see any change in the way the image appears unless you have
added a border to your image, an option I don’t recommend. (For more
on using image borders, see the Border Thickness option in Table 8-1.)
It’s always a good idea to test your links. To do so now, click the Preview icon
at the bottom of the screen and your links will become active. Simply click
the linked text or image to open the page it links to. Click the Design icon at
the bottom of the screen to edit your page or create additional links.
Linking to pages outside your Web site
Linking to a page on another Web site is even easier than linking to another
page within your site. If you have the URL of the page to which you want to
link, you’re most of the way there.
To create an external link, follow these steps:
1. In FrontPage, create a page or open the page from which you want
to link.
2. Select the text or image that you want to serve as a link.
3. Click the Insert Hyperlink icon on the standard toolbar.
The Insert Hyperlink dialog box opens.
148
Part III: Creating Web Pages and Adding Multimedia 

4. In the Address box at the bottom of the dialog box, enter the URL of
the page you want to link to.
Alternatively, you can click the arrow to the right of the Address box and
choose any link from the list. FrontPage collects your recently visited
URLs in this list.
If you’re not sure of the URL or you don’t want to type it, you can click
the Browse the Web icon (the small icon that looks like a globe with a
magnifying glass over it at the top of the Insert Hyperlink dialog box).
FrontPage launches Internet Explorer and, if you’re connected to the
Internet, lets you browse the Web. When you find the page you want to
link to, leave it displayed in the browser, switch back to FrontPage, and
the URL is automatically inserted in the Address box.
5. Click OK.
The Insert Hyperlink dialog box closes and the link is set.
Although you don’t have to type the http:// at the beginning of a Web site
address to get to a site in most browsers, you need to use the full URL, includ-
ing the http://, when you create an external link. Otherwise, the browser
may think that www.whatever.com is the name of a folder on your Web server
rather than an external site address, and you’ll get a 404, Page Not Found
error.
See Figure 8-10 for an example of how you set a link to the Wiley Publishing
Web site, using its full URL.

Chapter 8: Working with Microsoft FrontPage

Setting a link to an e-mail address
Another common link option is to link directly to an e-mail address, making it
easy for visitors to send you a message. I recommend that you invite visitors
to contact you because getting feedback on your Web site is half the fun.
Setting a link to an e-mail address is almost as easy as setting a link to another
Web page. Before you start, make sure you have the e-mail address to which
you want to link handy because you’ll have to insert that into the link field in
the Insert Hyperlink dialog box.
To a visitor to your Web page, text linked to an e-mail address looks just like
text linked to a Web page, so it’s a good idea to identify e-mail links. Unlike
links to other Web pages, which simply open a page in the browser window,
an e-mail link launches an e-mail program on the user’s computer and inserts
the e-mail address. E-mail links make it easy to send you an e-mail, but click-
ing one can be disconcerting if a visitor isn’t expecting to open his or her
e-mail program.
To create an e-mail link in FrontPage, follow these steps:
1. In FrontPage, create a page or open the page on which you want to
create an e-mail link.
2. Click to highlight the text or image where you want to create the link.
3. Click the Insert Hyperlink icon on the standard toolbar.
The Insert Hyperlink dialog box appears.
4. Select the E-mail Address option, at the bottom left of the dialog box.
The Insert Hyperlink dialog box changes to display e-mail link options.
5. In the Text to display box, enter or edit the text you want to use to
represent the link on the page.
6. In the E-mail address box, enter the e-mail address you want to link to.
For example, in Figure 8-11, I’m creating an e-mail link to Janine@
jcwarner.com. The mailto: is inserted automatically when you enter
an e-mail address.
7. If you want to add a subject line to the user’s e-mail when the user
clicks your e-mail link, enter some text in the Subject box.
If you’re creating links to the same e-mail address repeatedly, you may
appreciate that FrontPage stores e-mail addresses after you link to them.
You can find them in the Recently used e-mail addresses area of the Insert
Hyperlink dialog box. Simply click the e-mail address you want to reuse
and it’s inserted into the E-mail Address box.
8. Click OK and the e-mail link is set.

Changing Background Colors 
and Other Page Properties
In the Page Properties dialog box, FrontPage provides access to many of the
features that apply to an entire page, including the page’s background color,
link and text colors, and page title. (The page title appears at the top of the
browser, next to the browser name, and is also the text saved in a user’s
bookmarks list.)
The Page Properties dialog box has multiple tabs across the top, each contain-
ing options that apply to the entire page. You can make many adjustments to
a Web page, but to keep things simple, the following steps show you how to
change the most common elements on your pages: the background color, text
color, and the title.
Follow these steps:
1. Right-click the page and choose Page Properties, or choose File➪
Properties.
The Page Properties dialog box appears.
2. In the Title field of the General tab, enter a title for your page.
The title of your page appears at the very top of the browser window.
Page titles are important because they’re used by many search engines
and by browsers to identify your page when it’s bookmarked by a user.
If you don’t enter a title, FrontPage titles your pages with the words
“New Page.”

3. Click the Formatting tab.
The Background, Text, and Hyperlink color options become visible, as
shown in Figure 8-12.
4. In the Background pull-down list, select a background color.
Select any color you like from the displayed colors in the pull-down list,
or select More Colors to open the More Colors dialog box and click to
select any color from the color wheel. The color you select fills the color
swatch box in the Background box in the Colors area. The color does
not fill the background of your page until you click the OK button, which
also closes the dialog box. If you want to alter the text color or other
options, don’t click OK until you’ve made all your changes.
Make sure that the background and text colors you select look good
together and, more important, that the text color is readable against the
background color.
5. In the Text pull-down list, select a text color.
The process is similar to setting the background color. Select any color
you like from the displayed colors in the pull-down list, or select More
Colors to open the More Colors dialog box and click to select any color
from the color wheel. The color you select fills the color swatch box in
the Text box in the Colors area.
6. After you’ve made your changes, click the OK button to close the Page
Properties dialog box.
Your changes are applied to the page.

Part III: Creating Web Pages and Adding Multimedia 

Creating Complex Page Designs
with Tables and Layers
One of the most frustrating aspects of Web page design is that you can’t just
place pictures and text anywhere you want on a page. If you drag an image to
the bottom-left corner of a Web page, for example, the image pops back up to
the top and aligns itself to the left of the page, unless you specify another
alignment option. This annoying limitation is not the fault of FrontPage or
Dreamweaver or any other Web design program; it’s a limitation of HTML and
the way that Web design works.
Sure, you can align images and text with the left, right, and center alignment
options, but when you want to create more complex designs, you’re best
served by using HTML tables or HTML layers. Layers are by far the easier
option. You simply insert a layer by choosing Insert➪Layer or by clicking the
Layers icon on the toolbar. After you’ve created a layer, you can insert an
image, text, or other content into the layer, and simply click and drag to place
the layer and its contents anywhere you want on the page.
Unfortunately, layers are still a relatively new formatting option in HTML and
are not supported by all browsers, which is why many professional designers
still use HTML tables to create complex page designs even though they’re much
harder to work with. If you know that all your visitors are using one of the latest
versions of Internet Explorer or Netscape, you should be able to use layers with-
out concern. But if someone visits your site with an older browser, beware that
content inserted into a layer may not appear on that visitor’s screen.
Because all browsers do not support layers, I chose to use HTML tables to
create the designs in the templates for Chapters 11 through 14. If you use
one of these page templates, you may notice the dotted lines within the page
designs that represent the edges of the tables. You can click and drag the
edges of a table to resize the cells, and you can add, merge, split, and delete
table cells in the Tables Properties dialog box to adjust the cells in a table.
To open the Table Properties dialog box, choose Table➪Table Properties and
then select Table to edit the entire table or Cell to edit a selected cell within
the table.
Like most designers, when I create tables to control page design, I set the
border value of the table to 0 so visitors don’t see the table I use to keep
images and other content in place. You can create a table by clicking the
Insert Table icon on the toolbar.
Working with layers and tables can get complicated, and covering them in
detail is beyond the scope of this book. To discover more about creating
complex page designs by using tables and layers, consult the help files in
FrontPage or pick up a copy of FrontPage 2003 For Dummies by Asha Dornfest
(published by Wiley).

Chapter 8: Working with Microsoft FrontPage

Previewing Your Page in a Browser
FrontPage displays Web pages much like a Web browser, but it doesn’t let you
follow links. Also, different browsers display pages differently. So, to check
links and to see how your Web page looks, it’s important to check your work
in multiple Web browsers (at least Netscape and Internet Explorer) regularly.
The simplest way to preview your work and test your links is to save the
page you’re working on, and then choose File➪Preview in Browser. FrontPage
provides multiple options so that you can view your page at different screen
resolutions and in different browsers.
When you install FrontPage, it automatically finds a browser on your com-
puter and uses that browser as the default in the Preview in Browser option.
If you want to test your work in other browsers (and you should), add more
options to the list. Choose File➪Preview in Browser➪Edit Browser List, and
then navigate around your hard drive to find the icon for the browser you
want to add to the list. The browser must be on your hard drive for you to
add it to the list.
Publishing Your Pages to a Web Server
When you build a Web site with FrontPage, you create all the pages on your
computer. Then when you’re ready to publish your site on the Internet, you
transfer all the pages, images, and other content to a Web server. The advan-
tage of this method is that you can edit your pages on your computer and
work out any problems before going “live.”
You can publish a single page or an entire site full of pages all at once. After
you publish your site for the first time, updating or revising your site is as
easy as replacing the page or images you’ve added or changed.
Follow these instructions to set up FrontPage to connect to your Web server
and publish your Web site:
1. Choose File➪Publish Site.
The Remote Web Site Properties dialog box appears.
2. Specify a Remote Web server type.
FTP is the most common method for transferring files to a Web server. If
you use a commercial service provider to host your Web site, select the
FTP option. If you use a server that supports FrontPage extensions and
you’re using these advanced features (which are not covered in this
book), choose the FrontPage or SharePoint Services option. Don’t worry
about the WebDAV system, unless you know that your system uses this
154
Part III: Creating Web Pages and Adding Multimedia 

advanced development option. If you’re publishing your Web site to a
server within your company, university, or organization and you’re on
the same network, you may use the File System option. If you’re not
sure which option to use, check with your service provider or system
administrator.
3. Enter a Remote Web site location.
If you are using a commercial service provider and selected the FTP
option in Step 2, enter the FTP location, which is usually your domain
name preceded by ftp (for example ftp.mydomain.com. Beware, however,
that the location address can vary depending on the kind of Web server
you’re using and how it was set up. Again, check with your service
provider or system administrator if you’re not sure how to access your
Web server.
If you selected one of the more advanced Web server types in Step 2,
check with your system administrator for connection information
required in this step and the following steps.
4. Enter an FTP directory.
This is usually a long address to a directory on the server, and it will
look something like: /web/users/jcwarner.
5. Click to select the Publishing tab at the top of the Remote Web Site
Properties dialog box.
6. Click to select the Changed pages only option.
This ensures that only the pages you have updated on your site will be
published. If you’re publishing your site for the first time, all pages will
be transferred to the server. After that, only pages that you have changed
will be transferred.
7. Click OK.
The User Name and Password dialog box appears.
8. Enter your user name and password.
If you don’t know your user name and password for your server, your
service provider or system administrator should be able to provide you
with that information.
9. Click OK.
FrontPage automatically accesses your Web server, displaying the con-
tents of the server on the right side of the window and the contents of
your site on your hard drive on the left, as shown in Figure 8-13.
10. In the Local Web site window, select the files and folders that you
want to publish on the server.
To select multiple files, Shift+click (on a PC) or Ô+click (on a Mac) as you
select the file names, or click and drag to select multiple files at once. You
can also use Ctrl+click (PC and Mac) to select noncontiguous files.
155
Chapter 8: Working with Microsoft FrontPage

11. Click the single, right-facing arrow between the Local Web site and
Remote Web site windows to transfer the files.
FrontPage copies the selected files to your Web server, replacing any
older versions with the same file names.
The built-in FTP features in FrontPage make it easy to publish your Web site
to a server and to update your site. After you transfer your files to the server,
it’s always a good idea to test your work by viewing your published pages
with a Web browser. If you find any errors or want to make further changes,
simply edit the page in FrontPage and then replace the page on the server
with your corrected page.
In Chapter 9 you find an introduction to working with FrontPage templates.
And in Chapters 11 through 14 you find instructions for using FrontPage to
customize the various predesigned Web pages included on the CD to create a
baby site, wedding site, sports site, and travel site. Using the instructions in
this chapter, you can edit any of the predesigned sites on the CD — even alter-
ing them to create different kinds of Web sites. For example, you can turn the
predesigned travel site or wedding site into a more general family Web site.

W
ant to create a personalized Web page without having to do all the
work yourself? If so, you’re going to love working with templates.
A template is essentially a predesigned page that you can customize by
replacing the images and text with your own content. Web site templates
come in many forms, from basic HTML pages to more advanced template 
formats unique to the program in which they were created. For example,
Macromedia Dreamweaver — a popular Web design program — offers a tem-
plate format with special features that work in only that program. FrontPage
boasts two kinds of template formats.
To help you create beautiful, professionally designed Web sites quickly and
easily, I’ve included a collection of predesigned Web site templates on the CD
that accompanies this book. In Chapters 11 through 14, you find instructions
for personalizing these templates to create a variety of Web sites. The tem-
plate pages on the CD are saved in basic HTML format so they can be opened
and edited in any Web design program. If you want to take advantage of the
special template features in FrontPage 2003, you can turn any of the pre-
designed template pages on the CD into FrontPage templates by using the
instructions in this chapter.
If you want to use the templates provided on the CD but prefer to use
Dreamweaver for your Web design, visit www.digitalfamily.com. On the
site, you’ll find a link to special bonus materials for readers of this book —
instructions for using Dreamweaver MX 2004 to create the template sites 
featured in Chapters 11 through 14.

Understanding FrontPage Templates
Like other Web design programs, FrontPage 2003 enables you to open a pre-
designed HTML page, such as the templates included on the CD, and edit the
content as you would any other HTML page.
Because templates are so useful for creating Web sites, FrontPage features
two special template formats. You can also open any basic HTML template in
FrontPage. The following list will help you appreciate the differences between
these two options.
 The simplest FrontPage template format uses the .tem extension. These
templates are essentially basic HTML pages, but when you save a file
in this template format in FrontPage, it becomes available in the New
dialog box and can easily be used to create new pages.
 FrontPage also supports a more advanced format called dynamic Web
templates. These files are designated by the .dwt extension and include
locked regions, which can’t be altered (a trick favored by professional
designers who want to prevent novices from ruining their page layouts).
Dynamic Web templates also enable you to make global changes to a Web
site; any page created from a dynamic Web template can be automatically
altered by changing the original template and applying those changes to
all pages created from that template. Creating dynamic Web templates is
much more technically complicated than creating basic FrontPage tem-
plates, and dynamic Web templates are generally used by professional
designers on big Web sites with many contributors. If you want to get
into these more advanced template features in FrontPage, I recommend
FrontPage 2003 For Dummies by Asha Dornfest (Wiley Publishing).
Figure 9-1 shows an example of a simple HTML template designed for a baby
Web site. Notice that the image area in the middle of the page is represented
by a graphic with the words Insert Photo to make it easy to identify where to
place your picture on the page. Similarly, the text area under the graphic
reads, Insert photo caption here. No matter what format a template is in, you
will often find images and text that include instructions like this to make it
easier to see where you should personalize the content without altering the
design. In a template such as this one, you can also edit the graphics, such as
the Next and Previous buttons that appear to the right and left of the photo.
However, image files have to be edited in a program such as Photoshop
Elements 3 (covered in Chapter 6). 
The template folders on the CD that correspond to Chapters 11 through 14
include the image files for the banners and buttons used in the page designs.
That means you can customize the graphics as well as replace the images
and text.
158
Part III: Creating Web Pages and Adding Multimedia 

Finding Templates
You can get Web page templates from a variety of sources, starting with the
CD that came with this book. In Part IV I walk you through the steps of using
the templates on the CD to create four common Web sites: a baby site, a wed-
ding site, a travel site, and a sports or hobby site. Although each template
was designed for a specific kind of site, you can mix and match or alter these
templates to create dramatically different site designs. For example, you can
use the banner graphic and buttons from the baby site with the page layout
for the wedding site to create a new design that combines your favorite ele-
ments of these two templates.
FrontPage comes with a variety of templates, and you can download more
templates for free from the Microsoft Web site by visiting
office.microsoft.com/templates
These templates can also be used in their entirety or combined with any
other templates to create new designs.
You’ll find many services that sell templates designed especially for use in
FrontPage. To locate sites that sell templates, type the words FrontPage and
template in a search engine such as Google; you’ll discover thousands of
Figure 9-1:

matches. The cost ranges from a few dollars to hundreds of dollars and the
quality and designs vary dramatically.
No matter where you get your templates, the instructions in the following
section will help you put them to use in FrontPage.
Creating New Pages and Sites
You can use templates to create one Web page or to create all the pages in a
Web site. Often, you’ll use one template for the main page of your site and a
different template for each of the main subsections, such as the pages within
a photo gallery. Microsoft has developed many Web site templates that pro-
vide a collection of page designs that combine to make up an entire site.
You can find the FrontPage templates in the New dialog box, which opens in
the right side of the work area when you choose File➪New. The New dialog
box, shown in Figure 9-2, is divided into four sections: New page, New Web
site, Templates, and Recently used templates.
The New dialog box, shown in Figure 9-3, is divided into four sections: New
page, New Web site, Templates and Recently used templates.

160
Part III: Creating Web Pages and Adding Multimedia 

I find the options in the New dialog box a little confusing, so let me try to help
you make sense of your choices:
 New page: In this section, selecting the More Web site templates option
opens the New Page Templates dialog box, where you’ll find individual
template pages, such as a single predesigned Photo Gallery page or the
Bibliography page (refer to Figure 9-2). When you select one of these tem-
plate options, FrontPage creates an individual HTML page from the tem-
plate you selected and opens it in the main work area, where you can edit
the new page as you would any other page in Front Page. You can create
as many pages as you like from any of the New page templates. You can
also save any of these individual page designs into an existing Web site.
For example, you can add a bibliography page to a site you’ve created
about the history of circus elephants. (You find step-by-step instructions
for creating a page from a template in the exercise that follows.)
 New Web site: In this section, selecting the More Web site templates
option opens the New Web Site Templates dialog box, where you’ll find
predesigned Web site templates. When you select a Web site template,
such as the Corporate Presentation template, FrontPage creates multiple
HTML pages from the site template and displays the names of the pages
and folders in the site in the FrontPage Web Site window. In Figure 9-4,
you see the files and folders generated when you select the Personal
Web site template. Many of the FrontPage Web site templates include

Chapter 9: Timesaving Templates

images, which are automatically copied to the images folder of the new
site when it’s created. To open a page in the new site, double-click the
file name in the Web Site window. To edit the images, you need to use a
program such as Photoshop Elements, covered in Chapter 6.
 Templates: This section of the New dialog box features a search field
you can use to look for templates on the Microsoft site and a link labeled
Templates on Office Online. If you click the link and are connected to
the Internet, FrontPage launches Internet Explorer and opens the Office
Templates page on the Microsoft Web site. Although both features
can lead you to more templates that you can download and install in
FrontPage, most of what you’ll find on the Office site are templates
designed for business use, not for personal or family sites.
 Recently used templates: As the name implies, this section of the New
dialog box features shortcuts to the last few templates you’ve opened.
No matter which of these options you select, after you’ve created a page or a
site from a template, you can edit the pages just as you would edit any page
in FrontPage. To help you get the idea of how this all works, the following
exercise shows you how to create a new HTML page from a template in the
Page Templates dialog box.

To use a FrontPage template to create a single new HTML page, follow these
steps:
1. Choose File➪New.
The New page dialog box opens on the right side of the screen.
2. In the New page section, select the More page templates option.
The Page Templates dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 9-5.
3. Click to select the template you want to use to create your new page.
The Page Templates dialog box has four tabs across the top, each with a
different set of options:
• General: Displays templates that came with the program and can be
used to create a single predesigned Web pages (open in Figure 9-5).
• My Templates: Displays any templates you’ve added to FrontPage
(adding a template is covered in the following section of this 
chapter).
• Frames Pages: Displays templates for creating pages designed with
HTML frames.
• Style Sheets: Displays a list of predesigned Cascading Style Sheets
(CSS). Style sheets in HTML, which work much like styles in a pro-
gram such as Word, enable you to save a set of formatting options
so that you can apply them all at once to text or other elements on
a Web page. Style sheets are not templates, but they can be applied
to pages created with templates just as they can be applied to any
other page. Working with CSS is beyond the scope of this book, but
Figure 9-5:
FrontPage
features a
variety of

designs.
163
Chapter 9: Timesaving Templates

you can find lots of information about CSS in FrontPage 2003 For
Dummies by Asha Dornfest (Wiley Publishing).
4. Click OK.
FrontPage creates a page based on the selected template.
5. Choose File➪Save to save and name the new page.
Always save any new page before you start setting links or inserting
images. If you’re adding the new page to an existing site, make sure to
save the page in the main folder of that site. If you’re using the new page
to create a site, use the New folder icon at the top of the Save As dialog
box to create a folder for the files of your site when you save the file.
You can name the new page anything you like; just remember not to use
spaces or special characters.
You can edit a new page created from a template as you would any other file
in FrontPage. To replace existing text, highlight the words you want to replace
and type to enter new text. You can use the icons on the toolbars to format
the text, align the text, and more. (Chapter 8 covers many basic page editing
features in FrontPage, including inserting images and setting links.)
Adding Templates to FrontPage
You can save any page as a template in FrontPage to make it available from the
New Templates dialog box. You have a few options for this task, depending
on where your templates come from and how they were made.
If you downloaded templates from the Microsoft Web site, they’re automati-
cally added to the Page Templates or Web Site Templates dialog box. To
download templates from the Microsoft site, visit
office.microsoft.com/templates
Browse the template section of the Office Template site until you find a tem-
plate you want to download, as shown in Figure 9-6. When you click the
Download Now button, the template is imported directly into FrontPage and
becomes available in the list of Web site templates.
Several templates are in the Author Files section of the CD that came with
this book. These templates are predesigned HTML pages. You can edit them as
you would edit any HTML page in FrontPage, and you can save them as tem-
plates to make them available in the My Templates tab of the Page Templates
dialog box. The templates on the CD are organized in folders based on the
chapters to which they correspond. For example, the wedding site template
pages are located in the template-wedding-site folder, which is in the Ch12
Wedding Site folder.
164
Part III: Creating Web Pages and Adding Multimedia 

Creating New Templates in FrontPage
You can save any HTML page as a template in FrontPage and add it to the
options in the My Templates tab of New Page templates dialog box.
If you want to save an HTML page as a template in FrontPage (such as the
templates on the CD that accompanies this book or templates you purchase
from a Web site), follow these steps:
1. Open the page you want to save as a template in FrontPage as you
would open any other Web page.
Choose File➪Open and locate the file on your hard drive or other media,
such as a CD.
2. Choose File➪Save As.
The Save As dialog box appears.
3. Click the arrow to the right of the Save as type box to reveal the file
type options, and select FrontPage Template (see Figure 9-7).
The page is saved as a template and added to the My Templates section
of the Page Templates dialog box.

Chapter 9: Timesaving Templates

Using templates is a great way to create a well-designed Web site quickly and
easily — even if you think you have the design talents of a toad. But don’t
stop with the predesigned pages of a template. You can alter templates as
much as your imagination allows to create your own personalized Web site,
while still benefiting from the original, professionally designed features of
the template. You find instructions for editing Web pages in FrontPage in
Chapter 8, and for creating and editing images in Chapter 6.

In This Chapter
 Adding video to your pages
 Inserting audio files
 Adding animation to your pages with Flash
 Working with other multimedia and plug-in files
A
still photo is a great way to show off a baby’s smile, but when you want
to capture the sound of a child’s laughter or the sight of a baby’s first
steps, you need audio, video, and other multimedia files on your Web pages.
This chapter provides an introduction to the many kinds of multimedia you
can use on the Web, from video and audio to animations and interactive navi-
gation features. Although I can’t show you everything there is to know about
editing video or creating animations — that gets complicated and would fill
an entire book — you will find recommendations for easy-to-use video editing
programs and other resources that can help you create multimedia yourself.
In the first section, I offer a few suggestions for creating digitized videos from
your home movie collection and how to capture, with almost any digital
camera, short clips that are ideal for the Web. Later in the chapter, I cover
audio files and working with Macromedia Flash MX 2004 (the most popular
program for creating animations and other interactive features for the Web)
and offer some general information about the range of other multimedia soft-
ware on the market.
One of the most important parts of this chapter is the series of step-by-step
exercises in each section that show you how to use FrontPage 3 to insert 
multimedia files into your Web pages. Adding a video file or a Flash animation
is similar to inserting an image into a Web page, with a few additional steps
that control how the multimedia file will play.

If you have a video file ready and just want to find out how to add it to your
Web site, skip ahead to the section on “Inserting video into a Web page.” If
you have an audio file, read “Inserting a background sound” and “Creating a
link to a sound file.” To add a Flash file to your pages, skip ahead to “Inserting
Flash files.”
If you’re not sure where to begin, but you know that you want to spruce up
your pages with multimedia, keep reading. Throughout this chapter, you find
tips for creating and converting multimedia and an overview of the many
options available.
Adding Video to Your Web Pages
Video is best for illustrating things that are hard to convey in words or still
images, such as a gymnast’s cartwheel or the trick or treat of a well-dressed
goblin on Halloween. Use video as a complement to still photos and written
stories. For example, in a Web site about your daughter’s ballet class, you
might describe the teacher’s best lessons, share your daughter’s aspirations
to be a professional ballerina, and then offer a link to a short video clip where
she shows off a few dance steps.
A little video goes a long way on the Web, where seconds of video may require
minutes to download on a slow dial-up connection. Unless you’re very experi-
enced with video and know that your visitors have fast connections and fast
computers, it’s best to stick with short video clips of no more than 30 seconds
to 2 minutes. That may not seem like much, but remember that most television
commercials are only 15- to 30-second spots. If you’re clever about editing your
video, you can say a lot in a few seconds.
One of the greatest challenges of working with video is that you have so many
choices. You can shoot video with a digital video camera or on videocassette
and then convert it to a digital format. (You find tips about digitizing in the
next section, “Preparing video for the Web.”) If you want to edit your video,
you can choose from a wide range of video editing programs, covered in the
“Comparing video editing programs” sidebar. Then you have to decide which
video format you want to use — Windows Media, QuickTime, RealMedia, or
any of at least a half dozen options covered in the “Comparing video formats”
section, later in this chapter.
After you’ve made those choices, you still have to think about how you want
to link the video to your pages (covered in “Inserting video into a Web page”).
And, finally, I recommend that you include at least a few words describing what
visitors will see on the video, how long it is, and the type of program needed to
view it. You want your visitors to know what to expect so that they don’t get
frustrated because they have to wait longer than they thought for your video
to load or they can’t play it because they don’t have the right software.

Comparing video editing programs
Anyone who’s had to sit through someone else’s
amateur home movies knows why video editing
software is so crucial. Too many blurry, shaky
images, stomach-wrenching zooms, and abrupt
pans, and you find yourself clutching the arms
of your chair and hoping you don’t have to sit
through much more.
Even professionals fall prey to these common
mistakes, which is why even pros shoot at
about a 20:1 ratio — that is, they expect to have
to shoot 20 minutes of tape to capture 1 usable
minute of video. Be kind to your audience and
do what the pros do — ruthlessly cut your video
down to only the very best moments, and
arrange segments so that they have a logical
beginning, middle, and end.
Every program listed in this section lets you per-
form basic editing and cutting as well as create
fade-ins. The programs also support the addi-
tion of special features, such as opening titles,
voice-overs, and music tracks. As you go up the
price scale, you add features for creating spe-
cial effects, slow motion, fast motion, and even
filters that can make your video look like a
scratchy sepia-toned 1920s era silent movie.
The following are some of the most popular
video editing programs on the market today:
 Adobe Premiere: This high-end video edit-
ing program is comparable to the Holly-
wood standard, Final Cut Pro, but it’s not
quite as expensive and it works on a PC. To
use this program effectively, you need a
very fast computer, gigabytes of available
hard drive space, and a lot of free time.
 Adobe Premiere Elements: This new “lite”
version of Adobe Premier is much better
suited to a home user. It costs about $600
less (retailing for about $100) and the menus
and options are much simpler to master.
Unless you’ve managed to get your mitts on
a $30,000 high-definition video camera,
Premiere Elements is more than enough for
your needs.
 Pinnacle Studio Plus 9.0: This program is
aimed at the “prosumer” market, meaning
it’s designed for people who have some
familiarity with shooting and editing video
and want a lot of features but aren’t profes-
sionals and don’t have a company expense
account to cover their costs. Studio Plus
does the basics, capturing video and allow-
ing you to cut and paste scenes, dub audio,
and create titles. It also includes some spe-
cial effects (such as slow motion, burring,
and stretching an image) and even a blue-
screen feature, which lets you film against
a blue background and then combine video
files to create movies of things that aren’t
possible, like making it appear as though
your hamster can dunk a basketball as well
as Michael Jordan can.
 Ulead MediaStudio: This program includes
both VideoStudio and a useful audio editing
program. “Lite” versions of Ulead’s products
are often bundled with capture cards or
other hardware and provide basic video edit-
ing features. MediaStudio is designed for
people who want to make their own versions
of music videos on a tight budget. You can
also add plug-ins that enable MediaStudio to
work with high-definition video and do basic
retouching of the images.
 iMovie: Part of Apple’s iStudio suite and an
excellent video editing program, iMovie is
available only for the Macintosh. Many
Macs now come with iStudio already
installed, so if you have a newer Mac you
probably already have this editing program.
Acclaimed for its intuitive interface, iMovie
is fully integrated with the rest of iStudio,
which includes iPhoto, and works seam-
lessly with Mac’s DVD and CD creation 
software.

Preparing video for the Web
Before you can add video to your Web pages, it must be in a digitized format
so that it can be read by a digital device, such as a computer or a DVD player.
If you use a digital camera, your video is already digitized. If you’re using a
camera that records to tape, however, you’ll have to digitize the contents of
the cassettes before you can put the video online.
Digitizing your home video collection and old family movies can yield great
material for your family Web site. And the good news is that you don’t have
to digitize, optimize, or edit your own video — you can have someone do it
for you. Many companies offer these video services for a reasonable fee. To
find a service in your area, check your yellow pages under video editing ser-
vices or ask about digitizing video wherever you can get film developed —
many of these stores now offer video digitizing services as well.
After the video is digitized, it should be optimized, before you add it to your
Web pages. Optimizing video involves stripping out excess information and
using compression technologies to make the file download faster without
compromising too much on quality. Unfortunately, the limits of bandwidth
won’t let you put motion-picture quality video on your Web site, but you can
still produce video that looks good and works well on the Web if you have the
right tools and know a little about video editing.
Video editing is more complex than working with still images. But if you have
a video editing program, such as Adobe Premier Elements, optimizing video
and doing simple editing and cutting is something most people who are com-
fortable with computers can master in a matter of hours or days.
Comparing video formats
Video can be saved for the Web in several video formats and compression
options. Unfortunately, no one video option works for everyone on the Web.
To make sure video works best for your visitors, you may want to include
multiple choices. For example, you could have one link to a video file at the
highest quality for visitors with fast connections, and another link to a file at
a lower quality for those who are still limited to dial-up accounts. You may
also want to save video in different formats. In this section, I describe the
most common video formats and give you a few suggestions for choosing
the one that will work best for your audience.
To view video, your Web site visitors need a video player, sometimes referred
to as plug-in because it plugs in to the browser to extend its functionality.
These days, most computers come with preinstalled video and audio players
that will play the most common video formats, including Windows Media and
170
Part III: Creating Web Pages and Adding Multimedia 

MPEG. If you use a Windows computer, you probably have Windows Media
Player on your computer. If you use a Mac, you probably have QuickTime.
Both video players can handle multiple video formats and can be used on
both the Mac and the PC.
If you don’t have the player you want, you can download most of them for
free. Video players are relatively easy to install, even for novices, which is
why I recommend that you include instructions for downloading the best
player for the video on your Web pages. For tips on how to word these
instructions, see the “Creating warnings for multimedia files” sidebar. (In the
list of video formats that follows, I’ve included Web addresses for the most
popular players.)
What happens when you click a link to a video depends on many factors,
including the software available on your computer. Even if you use one of
the most popular formats, video may not work the same on someone else’s
system. For example, your computer may be set to open any video format
with Windows Media Player, but your cousin may watch the same video in
another program, such as the RealPlayer, because her office computer is set
up with different software.
Choosing the right video format
How do you know which format to use? One option is to ask your family and
friends which format they prefer and use their favorite option. If your friends
and family can’t agree, or you’re trying to reach a broad audience, your best
bet is to choose the most popular formats and provide instructions on your
Web page to help visitors download and install the corresponding player.
(You find a description of video formats in the sidebar called “Popular video
formats.”)
According to many Web designers, the most widely supported option for
video these days is Windows Media. Most PC computers now come with the
Windows Media player, and a version is available for Mac users as well. Other
Web designers prefer RealMedia and RealAudio formats from RealNetworks
because they say these formats provide better streaming and quality options.
The biggest challenge with RealMedia is that it requires special software on
the Web server. (Check with your Internet hosting service for rates and sup-
port.) QuickTime is another popular format, especially among Mac users.
Windows Media, RealMedia, and QuickTime are most popular formats, in
large part because they support streaming. To stream multimedia means to
make it possible to play a file while its downloading from the server. This is
valuable because video and audio files can take a long time to download.
171
Chapter 10: Lights, Camera, Action: Adding Video, Audio, and Motion

Here’s how streaming works. When you click a link to a video file, your com-
puter begins to download it from the server. If you’re using a player that 
supports streaming, the video or audio file begins to play as soon as the first
part of it is successfully downloaded. If you don’t use streaming, the entire
file must be downloaded before play can start. Although it can take the same
amount of time to download the entire file, streaming can greatly reduce the
time it takes to view a video online.
You can convert video from one file format to another relatively easily with
most video editing programs. For example, you can open a video in AVI
format in a program such as Adobe Premier Elements (a great video editor
for beginners) and then choose File➪Export to convert it to any of a dozen
formatting and compression options. For example, you could convert an AVI
file to the Windows Media format with the compression setting for a 56K
modem or into the QuickTime format with the compression setting for a
cable modem. Editing video can get complicated, but converting a video file
is easy after you understand the conversion options. (For more video soft-
ware options, see the “Comparing video editing programs” sidebar.)
To help you appreciate the differences in quality and playback speed of
some of the video formats covered in this chapter, I included a sample video
on the CD and saved it in MPEG, Windows Media, and QuickTime formats
with different compression options. For example, karate-demo-QT-56k.qt
is a QuickTime file saved at a relatively low-quality setting so that it won’t
take as long to download over a modem. You’ll find the same video clip saved
in QuickTime at a higher-quality compression level better suited for those
with a cable modem. That file is karate-demo-QT-high.qt. The files in
Windows Media format and MPEG are named similarly. All were created from
the same AVI file by using the Adobe Premier Elements Export option. I also
included that original AVI file on the CD for comparison.
If you view these clips, you can quickly appreciate the variations in video
quality when you use different compression options. For example, the ver-
sion I saved in Windows Media at the 56K compression setting is only 146K,
which should take about 20 seconds to download over a 56K modem, but the
video looks very fuzzy because it has been compressed so much. In contrast,
the version saved in Windows Media at the higher quality level is nearly 2MB,
which takes about 4 1⁄2 minutes to download over a 56K modem, but it looks a
lot better. That’s why many designers offer both options on their Web sites.
Those who are willing to wait or have higher bandwidth are rewarded with
better quality video.
To view these video clips and see some of the differences for yourself, insert
the CD that came with this book into your computer’s CD player. The sample
files are in the video-clips folder, which is in the Ch10 Multimedia folder
in the Author Files section of the CD.
172
Part III: Creating Web Pages and Adding Multimedia 

You can copy the videos to your hard drive or just play them from the CD.
But note that you need more than 50MB of free space on your computer for
all the video files on the CD.
173
Chapter 10: Lights, Camera, Action: Adding Video, Audio, and Motion
Popular video formats
The following list provides a brief description of
the most common digital video formats:
 Windows Media Video:
Defined by
Microsoft and popular on the PC., this video
format supports streaming and can be
played with Windows Media Player as well
as many other popular players. Beware that
Windows Media is especially restrictive
when it comes to copyrighted content and
may restrict your ability to copy and play
commercial content, such as a clip copied
from a DVD.
File extension: .wmv
Web site: www.microsoft.com/
windows/windowsmedia
 RealVideo: This streaming file format was
designed by RealNetworks to play in
RealPlayer (available for Mac and PC).
RealMedia provides optimization well
suited to low-speed and high-speed con-
nections, but requires special software on
your Web server.
File extension: .rm
Web site: www.real.com
 MPEG: Pronounced “m-peg.” Video in the
MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group)
format can be optimized to download much
faster than formats with similar quality, such
as AVI. MPEGs can be played on most video
players, including Windows Media Player,
RealPlayer, and dedicated MPEG players.
File extension: .mpeg
Web site: www.mpeg.org
 QuickTime: Based on the MPEG standard,
QuickTime was developed by Apple. The
QuickTime player is built into the Macintosh
operating system and is used by most Mac
programs that include video or animation.
QuickTime is a great format for video on the
Web and supports streaming, but it’s used
primarily by those who favor Macs
(although QuickTime files can be viewed
with the Windows version of the QuickTime
plug-in).
File extension: .qt
Web site: www.quicktime.com
 AVI: Created by Microsoft, AVI (Audio Video
Interleave) is one the most common video
formats on Windows computers and can be
played on most common video players. AVI
is fine if you’re viewing video on your own
computer, where the file doesn’t have to
download, but these files are generally too
big to use on the Internet. If your files are in
AVI, you should convert them to one of the
other formats in this list before adding them
to your Web site. Otherwise, you force your
visitors to download unnecessarily large
video files.
File extension: .avi
Web site: No one site about AVI exists, but
you can find information if you search for
AVI at www.microsoft.com.

Inserting video into a Web page
You can insert a video file on your Web page so that the file plays when a visi-
tor opens the page. However, I recommend that you create a special page for
each video file and give your viewers an idea of what to expect before they
click the link. You don’t want to surprise your visitors with video. You want
to coax them into it, setting the stage and making sure they know it’s worth
the wait to download your Academy-Award caliber production.
You insert video on a Web page much like you insert an image file, as you see
in the following exercise, except you have more settings. For example, you
can set video to play when someone opens a link, or you can require that visi-
tors roll their cursor over an image to make it play.
You can also choose to loop, or repeat, the video. Why would you want to
make a video file play over and over again? Playing a short video clip repeat-
edly is a clever way to make the clip seem longer than it is. For example, a 
30-second clip of a child laughing may be highly entertaining when played
over and over again because it can sound like ongoing laughter.
174
Part III: Creating Web Pages and Adding Multimedia 
Creating warnings for multimedia files
Because multimedia files require special players, it’s a good idea to include a warning message
anytime you add video, audio, or other multimedia files to your Web site. The message should
include an explanation of the type of file you’re using, the size of the file, how long it may take to
download, and what kind of player is required to view it.
The following is an example of a warning you might include just below a video file:
To play this video file, roll your cursor over the image above. The video clip is 30 seconds long
and shows our daughter in her karate class. If you’re using a modem connection, it may take
a minute or two for the video to download and play. If the video does not appear to be playing
or if you receive an error message, you may not have the necessary software to play the video.
You can download a free multimedia player for a Windows computer by visiting www.
microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia and clicking the link for Microsoft’s Windows
Media Player. Make sure to download the player that’s right for your operating system. If
you have an Apple computer, you’ll want the Mac version. If you use a PC, choose the Windows
version.
You may want to recommend another player or shorten the message. If you’re sure your visitors
have the necessary software to play your multimedia files, you may want to include only a descrip-
tion of the video or audio file and information about its length or file size. If you include more than
one version of the file in different formats or sizes, make sure to explain the options so your visi-
tors know which is best for their system.

Looping is easily overdone on the Web, so use it judiciously. If you’ve ever
arrived at a page and been frustrated because you couldn’t turn off a flashing
animation or sound file, you understand the risk. Motion on a Web page can
get distracting and even annoying. Used prudently, looping is a good trick for
making a video clip seem longer than it is, but repeat a clip no more than
three times and then turn it off automatically. You find out how to specify
looping and other options in FrontPage in the “Setting video options” section,
later in this chapter.
The steps in this section will work for video files in any of the formats covered
earlier in this chapter, such as RealMedia, QuickTime, and Windows Media for-
mats. The “Comparing video formats” section, presented earlier, describes the
most common video options.
If you don’t have a video file but want to follow this exercise, you can use
the karate class video file, located in the Ch10 Multimedia folder in the
Author Files section of the CD. (In Figure 10-1, you can see what the file
looks like when inserted on a Web page.) I’ve included several versions of
this video, but I suggest you use karate-demo-WMV-high.wmv or, if you
prefer QuickTime, karate-demo-QT-high.mov.

175
Chapter 10: Lights, Camera, Action: Adding Video, Audio, and Motion

To use FrontPage to insert a video file, follow these steps:
1. Before you start, make sure the video file you want to insert is saved
in the multimedia subfolder in your main Web site folder.
You should keep all the files in your Web site in one main folder on your
hard drive. I suggest you create a subfolder for multimedia so you can
keep videos and other files organized.
2. In FrontPage, open the Web page, and click the cursor where you want
the file to be displayed on your Web page.
Make sure you’re in Design view in FrontPage by clicking the Design icon
at the bottom left of the page.
3. Choose Insert➪Picture➪Video, as shown in Figure 10-2.
(Video is the last option on the list, and you may need to use the down-
pointing arrow at the bottom of the menu to make all options visible.)
The Select Video dialog box appears.
4. Browse your drive to locate the video file you want to insert on your
page, and click to select it.
In the example I’m creating for this exercise, I selected a file called
karate-demo-WMV-high.wmv, which is in the Ch10 Multimedia folder
in the Author Files section of the CD.
Figure 10-2:

176
Part III: Creating Web Pages and Adding Multimedia 

5. Click Open.
The dialog box closes and the file is inserted on the page. The first frame
of the video appears on the page, representing the video.
6. Double-click the video image.
The Picture Properties dialog box appears.
7. Click the various tabs and specify the options you want:
• Click the Appearance tab and specify alignment, spacing, and size.
• Click the General tab and specify link options.
• Click the Video tab and specify loop, loop delay, and start options.
For detailed descriptions of the different options, see the “Setting video
options” section, which follows.
8. Click OK.
The Picture Properties dialog box closes.
9. To play the video, click the Preview button at the bottom of the
FrontPage work area.
If you prefer, choose File➪Preview in Browser to see the video as it will
appear when viewed with a browser on the Web.
It’s always a good idea to save your work in FrontPage regularly. You can do
so by choosing File➪Save, or using the key command, Ctrl+S (on a PC) or Ô-S
(on a Mac). If you haven’t already saved your changes before you choose the
preview option, FrontPage will prompt you to save your work before opening
your page in a browser. If you haven’t saved the page you’re working on,
FrontPage displays an asterisk in front of the file name in the tab at the top
of the work area. 
Setting video options
Inserting a video into a Web page is a simple process, but specifying all the
options can get complicated. In this section, you find descriptions of FrontPage
video options, divided into sections based on the tabs in the Picture Properties
dialog box.
The Appearance tab
The Appearance tab in the Picture Properties dialog box, shown in Figure 10-3,
offers the following options:
 Wrapping Style: Use this option to control how text wraps around your
video file. If you choose None, the video appears centered on the page
with nothing on either side. If you choose Left, the video appears on the
177
Chapter 10: Lights, Camera, Action: Adding Video, Audio, and Motion

left and the text wraps around the right side of the video. If you choose
Right, text wraps around the left side of the video.
 Alignment: The option enables you to specify how the video is aligned
on the page. Alignment works just as it does for images. Left, Right, and
Center align the video file to the left, right, or center, respectively, as you
would expect. The other options — Top, Middle, and Baseline — control
how the text next to the video aligns in relation to the video file. For exam-
ple, if you choose Middle, any text next to the video will align so that it
starts at the same level on the page as the middle of the video file on the
page. You can’t align text to appear on top of a video file. (You’d have to do
that in a video editing program before inserting the video on your page.)
 Border Thickness: This option specifies the width of the border around
the file. If you don’t want a border, enter 0 in this field.
 Horizontal Spacing: If you want to insert a blank space on either side of
the video, enter the number of pixels you want to add. That amount of
space will be inserted on the left and right sides of the video. Adding a
little space around an image or video is a good practice because it pro-
vides some separation between the video and other features on the page
and helps keep your design from looking too busy.
 Vertical Spacing: If you want to insert blank space above and below the
video, enter the number of pixels you want to add. That amount of space
will be inserted on the top and bottom of the video.
 Specify Size: If you want to specify the size of the area in which the
video file will be displayed on the page, select this option. Otherwise,
the video will appear in its actual size. To control the actual size of the
video, you must use a video editor, such as Adobe Premier Elements. If
you choose Specify Size, you can enter the width and height separately
or you can choose Keep Aspect Ratio and when you change the width or
the height the other will adjust automatically.
Figure 10-3:
The
Appearance
tab contains
alignment,
spacing,
and size
options.
178
Part III: Creating Web Pages and Adding Multimedia 

• Width: You can specify the width of the video in pixels or as a per-
centage of the browser window’s width.
• Height: You can specify the height in pixels or as a percentage of
the browser window’s height.
• Keep Aspect Ratio: Click this box if you want to ensure that the
height and width remain relative to the actual size of the video.
For example, suppose the video is 800 pixels wide by 600 pixels
high. If you check this box, you can change the width to 400 and
the height automatically changes to 200 to maintain the original
ratio.
The General tab
Most of the options in the General tab, shown in Figure 10-4, don’t apply to
video, because FrontPage uses this dialog box for a variety of file types. The
following options, however, do apply to video:
 Text: Check this option if you want to associate text with your video.
The text appears on the page only if the video is not visible. It’s impor-
tant to use this option to provide a description so that anyone using a
browser that can’t view the video will know what the video contains.
This text is used also by special browsers for the blind that “read” Web
pages to their users.
 Long Description: Use this option if you want to provide a more detailed
description of your video. You can use this option in addition to the Text
option.
Figure 10-4:
Use the
Location
option if you
want to
create a link
from a video
file to
another
page or
Web site.
179
Chapter 10: Lights, Camera, Action: Adding Video, Audio, and Motion

 Location: This option creates a link from the video clip on your Web
page to another page or Web site. Although it’s not common to link a
video file like this, you may want to use a link on the video to lead your
visitors to a related page or to more video. Use the Browse button to set
a link to another page or file on your site. If you want to link to another
Web site, enter the URL.
 Target Frame: If you use frames in your Web site, use this option to
specify the target frame you want the linked page to open into. If your
Web site uses frames and you don’t specify a target, the link will open in
the same frame as the link. A frames is an advanced Web design feature
that makes it possible to display multiple Web pages on one screen.
(I don’t cover frames in this book, and I don’t generally recommend
that you use them.)
The Video tab
The options under the Video tab, shown in Figure 10-5, apply only to video
files:
 Video Source: This option contains the link information that tells the
browser the location of the video file on your Web site. If you’ve already
linked your video to your page, the name of the video file and any folders
that it resides in should appear in this area. Do not change this information
unless you have moved the video file or want to reset the link.
 Loop: If you set the video to loop more than once, the video will replay
the number of times specified.
Figure 10-5:
You’ll find
the Loop
and Start
options
here.
180
Part III: Creating Web Pages and Adding Multimedia 

 Forever: Check this option if you want your video to play continuously,
but beware that your visitors will have no way to stop your video short
of closing the page.
 Loop Delay: Use this option to specify how long you want the browser
to wait after playing the video before starting it again.
 Start: This area of the dialog box contains two options relating to when
the video begins to play:
• On File Open: As soon as the page is opened, the video begins to
download and then plays.
• On Mouse Over: After a user moves the cursor over the image that
represents the video file on the page, the video begins to download
and then plays.
181
Chapter 10: Lights, Camera, Action: Adding Video, Audio, and Motion
Shooting video with a digital camera
If you’re in the market for a new video camera,
go digital. You’ll be able to use the video for your
Web site much more easily and you can still
save the video to a DVD to play on your home
entertainment system.
You may also be pleased to discover that you
can create short videos with many of the still
digital cameras on the market. For example,
most consumer-level digital cameras from
Canon, Nikon, and others can be used to record
video (they even capture sound). You may be
limited to shooting only 30 seconds of video at a
time, but the quality is remarkably good. Many
people don’t even realize their digital camera
will capture video as well as still images. Most
cameras with this feature have a setting option
that looks like a small, old-fashioned movie
camera. With a digital camera in this mode,
pushing the shutter starts video recording,
pushing it again stops it. If you don’t press the
shutter again before the 30-second limit, the
video stops recording automatically. You can
take multiple video clips and edit them together
or cut them into even smaller segments. Set the
camera back on the auto setting to take still 
pictures.
The example of the karate video featured in this
chapter and included on the CD was taken with
this technique. Using a Canon PowerShot digi-
tal camera, I captured a 30-second video of
a karate class and edited it to an even shorter 
20-second clip — plenty long enough to give
viewers an idea of what the kids look like
in a practice session. (You find the clip in
the video-clips subfolder in the Ch10
Multimedia folder on the CD.)
Remember, video fills up a camera’s memory
card much faster than still images (because
video files are much larger). The average 30-
second AVI format video from a digital camera
is at least 25MB. If you don’t already have a
memory card that holds at least 128MB, invest
in one before you start shooting video.

Adding Audio to Your Web Pages
FrontPage provides two choices for adding sound to your Web pages. The
first choice is to insert the sound file as a background sound so that the file
plays as soon as a visitor opens the page. The second choice is to create a
link to the sound file. When a user clicks the link, a multimedia player, such
as Windows Media Player, opens and plays the sound file.
Inserting a background sound
You can use FrontPage to insert a sound file into the background of a Web
page. The sound plays when a visitor opens the page. You can get many kinds
of sound files on CDs and Web sites, or you can record your own by plugging
a microphone into your computer and using any common sound recording
program, such as Sound Recorder.
In case you don’t already have an audio file and want to use one to follow this
exercise, I included a WAV file on the CD called jungle-animals.wav. You can
find this file in the Ch10 Multimedia folder in the Author Files section of
the CD.
Follow these steps to insert a sound file:
1. Before you start, make sure the audio file you want to insert is saved
in the main folder for your Web site.
I recommend creating a multimedia folder in your main Web site folder
for audio and other multimedia files, just as you should create an image
folder for your image files.
2. In FrontPage’s Design view, open the Web page to which you want to
add the audio file.
Make sure you’re in Design view by clicking the Design icon at the
bottom left of the page.
3. Choose File➪Properties.
The Page Properties dialog box appears. This dialog box contains many
settings that affect the entire page.
4. Click the General tab.
5. In the Background Sound area at the bottom of the page, click the
Browse button next to the Location option.
The Background Sound dialog box appears.

6. Browse to locate the sound file you want to insert in your page.
7. Click the file name to select it, and then click the Open button
(or double-click the file name).
The sound file is inserted into the background of the page, and the file
name and path appear in the Location box in the Background Sound
dialog box. In the example I’m creating in this exercise, I selected a file
called jungle-animals.wav, which was saved in the multimedia
folder for my sample Web site, as shown in Figure 10-6.
8. Specify the loop options in the Page Properties dialog box.
The loop options are at the bottom of the dialog box. You can choose to
loop, or repeat, the sound file a set number of times, or you can click to
select the Forever box and the sound file will play continuously. If you
set the Loop option to 0, the file will play once.
9. Click OK.
Your audio file options are saved and the Page Properties dialog box
closes.
Creating a link to a sound file
The second way to add audio to your Web page is to link to a sound file.
When a user clicks the link, it launches a sound player, such as Windows
Media Player, and plays the file.

Part III: Creating Web Pages and Adding Multimedia 
Popular audio formats
The following list provides a brief description of
each of the most common digital audio formats:
 MP3: By far the most successful audio com-
pression format, MP3 comes from the same
family as MPEG and supports streaming
audio. Most music you can download from
the Internet is in MP3 format, and it is
clearly the first choice of most Web devel-
opers. This format includes technology to
add watermarks, identification marks that
are invisible to most viewers but identify the
creator of the original music file when ana-
lyzed more carefully.
File extension: .mp3
Web site: www.mp3.com
 Windows Audio:Microsoft’s Windows Audio
format supports streaming and can be
played with Windows Media Player as well
as many other popular players. Windows
Audio is especially restrictive when it comes
to copyrighted content, which makes it pop-
ular among big recording studios but may
prevent your ability to copy and play com-
mercial music, such as songs copied from a
CD, even for legal personal use.
File extension: .wma
Web site: www.microsoft.com/
windows/windowsmedia
 RealAudio: This streaming file format was
designed for the Internet by RealNetworks
and can be played in RealPlayer (available
for Mac and PC). RealAudio is especially
popular among radio stations and entertain-
ment sites because it provides optimization
well suited to low-speed and high-speed
connections.
File extension: .ra
Web site: www.real.com
 Ogg Vorbis: The newest audio format on the
Web, Ogg Vorbis is open source that is not
patented. As a result, it is constantly being
improved by programmers who volunteer to
work on it, but you may not get much direct
support for this file type. Ogg Vorbis is the
only audio format for the Web that offers
surround sound for those who have multi-
ple speakers.
File extension: .ogg
Web site: www.vorbis.com
 WAV: This file format is popular in digital
media because it offers the highest sound
quality possible. But audio files in this
format are often too big for use on the Web,
averaging 10MB for a minute of audio (in
comparison, an MP3 file that is five times
longer can be less than one third the size).
Although WAV files are commonly used on
the Internet because of their nearly univer-
sal compatibility, I recommend that you
convert WAV files (especially for long audio
clips) to one of the other audio formats
described in this sidebar and compress
them before linking them to your Web site.
File extension: .wav
Web site: No official Web site exists for
WAV files, but you can find some documen-
tation at www.microsoft.com if you
search for WAV.

To create a link to a sound file, follow these steps:
1. Before you start, make sure the audio file you want to insert is saved
in the multimedia folder in your Web site folder.
I suggest that you create a multimedia folder in your main Web site
folder for your multimedia files.
2. In FrontPage, create a new page or open the page on which you want
to create a link.
Remember, always save the page you’re working on before you set links.
3. Select the text or image that you want to serve as the link.
That is, select the text or image that, when clicked, will open the sound
file.
4. Click the Insert Hyperlink icon on the standard toolbar.
(The icon looks like a globe with a link of chain next to it.) The Insert
Hyperlink dialog box appears.
5. Select the name of the sound file that you want your image or text to
link to, and then click OK.
The link is set and the dialog box closes. If you selected text, the words
appear underlined and in a different color. If you selected an image and
have not added a border, you will not see any change in the way the
image appears.
When a user clicks a link to a sound file, the browser must open a multimedia
player capable of reading the sound file format. If no such program is available
on the user’s computer, the audio file will not play. Because of this, include a
description of the audio file on your Web page with instructions for download-
ing the media player. For details of this process, see the “Creating warnings for
multimedia files” sidebar, earlier in this chapter.
Adding Animations with Flash
Macromedia Flash is by far the most widely used technology on the Web for
creating animations as well as many other interactive features, such as games
and interactive quizzes. Flash is ideally suited for use on the Web because
you can use it to create highly complex images and interactive features that
download quickly and adjust to fit any size screen.
185
Chapter 10: Lights, Camera, Action: Adding Video, Audio, and Motion

Flash is so popular on the Internet because it utilizes vector graphics, a tech-
nology in which the graphics are based on mathematical descriptions that
take up far less space than bitmapped graphics. Vector graphics can be
scaled up or down to fill a browser window of any size without affecting the
image quality or the size of the file that’s downloaded.
Flash files can be recognized by their file extension, .swf. As a format designed
specifically for the Web, Flash continues to win acclaim and widespread
adoption, and the program needed to view Flash files is now built into most
browsers. You can even synchronize sound in Flash.
Inserting a Flash file into your Web site is easy, but creating Flash files gets
complicated and requires Macromedia’s Flash creation program. If you want
to find out how to create Flash files, I recommend Flash MX 2004 For Dummies
by Gurdy Leete and Ellen Finkelstein (published by Wiley).
The good news is that Flash is so popular you can find Flash animations
almost as easily as you can find clip art. A number of Web sites offer free
Flash animations, and you can buy Flash files if you want something more
sophisticated or original. Just type the word Flash in any search engine and
you’ll find many great resources.
Inserting Flash files
If you don’t already have a Flash file, use the sample Flash file on the CD
accompanying this book. Just look for any file with the .swf extension, such as
logo-animation.swf in the Ch10 Multimedia folder in the Author Files
section.
To add a Flash file to a Web page with FrontPage, follow these steps:
1. Before you start, make sure the Flash file you want to insert is saved
in the multimedia folder in your Web site folder.
I suggest that you create a multimedia folder in your main Web site
folder for Flash files and other multimedia files.
2. Create a page, or open an existing Web page in FrontPage.
3. Click to insert the cursor where you want the Flash file to be displayed
on your Web page.
Make sure you’re in Design view in FrontPage by clicking the Design icon
at the bottom left of the page.
4. Choose Insert➪Picture➪Movie in Flash Format, as shown in Figure 10-7.
The Select File dialog box appears. Note that you may need to use the
expansion arrow to make the Picture option visible, as shown in Fig-
ure 10-7.
186
Part III: Creating Web Pages and Adding Multimedia 

5. Browse your drive to locate the Flash file you want inserted on your
page, and click to select it.
In the example I’m creating for this exercise, I selected a file called
logo-animation.swf.
6. Click Insert.
The dialog box closes and the Flash file is inserted on the page. In Design
view, the Flash file is represented by a large grey box with the name of the
file, as shown in Figure 10-8.
7. Double-click the grey box that represents the Flash file.
The Movie in Flash Format Properties dialog box opens.
8. Click the Appearance tab and specify options such as background
color, alignment, spacing, and size.
You find detailed descriptions of these options in the “Setting Flash
options” section that follows.
9. Click the General tab and specify options such as Auto play and loop.
Again, refer to the “Setting Flash options” section for more information
on these options.

Chapter 10: Lights, Camera, Action: Adding Video, Audio, and Motion

10. Click OK.
The Movie in Flash Format Properties dialog box closes.
11. Click the Preview button at the bottom of the FrontPage work area to
play the Flash file.
FrontPage doesn’t display Flash files in Design view, but it will play them
in Preview mode. If you prefer to check your work in a browser, choose
File➪Preview in Browser and the page will be displayed in a Web browser,
where the Flash file should function as it would on a Web page.
Flash files require a special Flash plug-in, which is built into most browsers.
If your visitors don’t have such program on their computers, the file will not
play. Because of this, make sure you include a description of the multimedia
file and instructions for downloading the player. See the sidebar on “Creating
warnings for multimedia files” for an example of such a warning.
The Flash plug-in, which you can get at www.flash.com, is free and down-
loads very quickly.

Part III: Creating Web Pages and Adding Multimedia 

Setting Flash options
Like other multimedia formats, Flash, has many options. These options,
called attributes in HTML, are especially important for Flash files because
many of them — such as height and width — are required for the files to
work properly in a browser. FrontPage takes care of setting the height and
width automatically, but you may want to change some other settings.
The Appearance tab
The Flash options shown in Figure 10-9 are available under the Appearance
tab in the Movie in Flash Format Properties dialog box in FrontPage.
The following is a brief description of each setting:
 Quality: This option enables you to prioritize the antialiasing options
of your images versus the speed of playback. Antialiasing, which makes
your files appear smoother, can slow down the rendering of each frame
because the computer must first smooth any rough edges. The Quality
parameter enables you to regulate how much the process is slowed
down by letting you set priorities based on the importance of appear-
ance versus playback speed. You can choose from these Quality options:
• Low: Antialiasing is never used. Playback speed has priority over
appearance.
Figure 10-9:
Double-click
a Flash file
and you’ll
find most
of these
settings.
189
Chapter 10: Lights, Camera, Action: Adding Video, Audio, and Motion

• Auto Low: Playback begins with antialiasing turned off. If the Flash
player detects that the processor can handle it, antialiasing is
turned on. Use this option to emphasize speed at first but improve
appearance whenever possible.
• Auto High: With this more sophisticated option, playback is set to
begin with antialiasing turned on. However, if the frame rate sup-
ported by the user’s computer drops too low, antialiasing turns
off to improve playback speed. This option emphasizes playback
speed and appearance equally at first but sacrifices appearance for
the sake of playback speed if necessary.
• Medium: Antialiasing is used only when needed. Appearance and
playback speed are balanced.
• High: Antialiasing is always used. Appearance has priority over
playback speed.
• Best: Antialiasing is always used. Appearance has priority over
playback speed. Not noticeably different from the High option
 Scale: Specify this option only if you change the file’s original Height and
Width settings. The Scale parameter enables you to define how the Flash
movie displays within those settings. The following options in the Scale
drop-down list enable you to set preferences for how a scaled Flash
movie is displayed in the window:
• Default (Show All): This option displays the entire movie in the
specified area. The width and height proportions of the original
movie are maintained and no distortion occurs, but borders may
appear on two sides of the movie to fill the space.
• No Border: This option enables you to scale a Flash movie to fill a
specified area. No border appears, and the original aspect ratio is
maintained.
• Exact Fit: The Flash movie is shown with the set width and height,
but the original aspect ratio may not be maintained.
 Background Color: This option sets a background color that fills the
area of the file. This color appears if the specified height and width are
larger than the file and during periods when the movie isn’t playing
because it’s loading or has finished playing.
 Alignment (under Movie): This alignment option controls how the Flash
file is aligned within the Flash display area on the page (as specified by
the selected height and width options). Unless you’ve changed the dis-
play area of the Flash file so that it’s larger than the actual size of the
Flash file (which I don’t recommend), you should keep this set to the
default, Center.
 Alignment (under Layout): This alignment option enables you to specify
how the Flash file is aligned on the Web page. Layout alignment for a
190
Part III: Creating Web Pages and Adding Multimedia 

Flash file works just as it does for images. Left, Right, and Center align
the video file to the left, right, or center, respectively, as you would
expect. The other options — Top, Middle, and Baseline — control how
the text next to the video aligns in relation to the video file. For example,
if you choose Middle, any text next to the video will align so that it starts
at the same level on the page as the middle of the video file on the page.
You can’t align text to appear on top of a video file. (You have to do that
in a video editing program before inserting the video on your page.)
 Border Thickness: This option specifies the width of the border around
the file. If you don’t want a border, enter 0 in this field.
 Horizontal Spacing: If you want a blank space on the left and right sides
of the Flash file, enter the amount of space in pixels.
 Vertical Spacing: If you want a blank space above and below the Flash
file, enter the amount of space in pixels.
 Specify Size: To specify the size of the area in which the Flash file will
appear on the page, select this option. Otherwise, the Flash file will
appear in its actual size.
• Width: You can specify the width of the Flash file in pixels or as a
percentage of the browser window’s width.
• Height: You can specify the height in pixels or as a percentage of
the browser window’s height.
• Keep Aspect Ratio: Check this box if you want to ensure that the
height and width remain relative to the size of the Flash file. For
example, if the Flash file is 400 pixels wide by 200 pixels high and
you check this box, you can change the width to 200 and the height
automatically changes to 100 to maintain the original ratio.
The General tab
The Flash options shown in Figure 10-10 are available under the General tab
in the Movie in Flash Format Properties dialog box in FrontPage. The follow-
ing is a brief description of the most important settings:
 Name field: This name is not the same as the file name. You need to 
provide a name for the Flash file only if you’re using a programming or
scripting language to control the file. The name is used by the script to
identify the file. You can leave this field blank or name the file whatever
you want (just don’t use spaces or special characters). FrontPage applies
a name if you leave the field blank.
 Source URL: This text field specifies the location of the .swf file. When
you create a link to a URL, this field is filled in by FrontPage. Although
you can change it manually, I recommend you do so only if you are very
experienced with creating links.
191
Chapter 10: Lights, Camera, Action: Adding Video, Audio, and Motion

 Base URL: You can use this attribute to specify the directory where your
Flash files are stored. If your visitors have trouble displaying your Flash
files, this setting can help their browsers identify the location of Flash
files. Unless your visitors use older browser version, this setting should
not be necessary.
 Playback: The following options control how the Flash file will play.
• Auto Play: This option controls the Play parameter, enabling you to
determine whether a Flash movie starts as soon as it downloads to
the viewer’s computer or a user must click the Flash file to play it. A
check mark in this box causes the Flash file to start playing as soon
as the page finishes loading. If you don’t check this box, whatever
option is set in the Flash file itself will be used to start the movie.
• Loop: Checking this box causes the Flash file to repeat (or loop). If
you don’t check this box, the Flash movie will play once and then
stop after it reaches the last frame.
• Show Menu: This option enables you to display a menu of options
if you’ve created a menu to go with the file.
• SWLiveConnect: Checking this box will insert the value “true.”
This attribute is used only by Netscape. Checking the box can
help ensure that your files play properly for visitors who use the
Netscape browser.
 Network Location: These settings identify the Class ID for Flash files and
the location of the Flash Player in case a visitor doesn’t have the plug-in
needed to display a Flash file. Microsoft automatically inserts the Class
ID and Netscape and Internet Explorer plug-in URLs in these boxes. You
should not to change these settings unless you know that you want to
specify a different location.

This is
where you
specify loop
and auto
play options.

Part III: Creating Web Pages and Adding Multimedia 

Working with Other Multimedia Formats
So many plug-ins, so little bandwidth. You can find hundreds of technologies
that use plug-ins to add special features to Web pages. Some of them give you
fabulous results, such as special sound effects, 360-degree images, and even
three-dimensional worlds. But with plug-ins — perhaps more than with any
other technology on the Web — you have to be careful. Web page visitors
aren’t usually excited about having to download a new plug-in, even if you as
a Web site creator are excited about deploying it. Indeed, many visitors are
scared by the idea, others are just plain annoyed, and still others lack the
hardware or software requirements to run the plug-in. Don’t risk doing that to
your viewers, especially when they’re family, unless you have a compelling
reason.
If you send visitors off to get a plug-in just so they can see a logo spinning
around in all its three-dimensional splendor, they aren’t going to be happy. On
the other hand, if your site features interactive games or a three-dimensional
environment with chat capability targeted for visitors with those interests,
they may be quite happy to go get a plug-in. Make sure that you let your users
know what they’re in for before you send them off on a plug-in adventure.
The best place to find out about multimedia formats is the Web itself. Any
technology that’s worth using should have a sophisticated Web site that
explains how the program works and where to find the necessary software
to create and watch it.

Creating Special
Project Sites

In this part . . .
T
he project-specific chapters in this part are designed
to tell you everything you need to get a Web site up
and running quickly for special events. Whether you want
to create a site for your new baby, for your wedding, or to
show off family vacation photos, you’ll find everything you
need in Chapters 11, 12, and 13. In Chapter 14, find out how
to create a site for your hobbies, clubs, or sporting events,
complete with instructions for including video. On the CD
that accompanies this book are predesigned template
pages and graphics that make it easy to personalize the
designs featured in each of these chapters. In Chapter 15,
you discover how one of the fastest growing trends on the
Internet — blogging — is a great way to post frequent mes-
sages and family stories online.

 Using templates to create your site
 Getting your site online
N
othing compares to a baby’s first photos or the eagerness of friends
and family who want to see them right away. That’s why this chapter
shows you how to get photos online in the quickest and easiest way possible,
and then goes on to cover creating a more elaborate Web site where you can
chronicle a child’s growth and development over time.
In the first section of this chapter you find out about online photo album serv-
ices, which provide an immediate solution to getting your photos online and
accessible to anyone with a connection to the Web. Then I introduce you to
online services that provide one-stop Web site solutions. Finally, you find out
how to use the templates included on the CD to create your own custom baby
Web site. You can use all three options or go directly to the section that covers
the option you like best.
Creating an Online Photo Album
If you want to get a few digital images online as fast as possible, the simplest
and least expensive option is a free photo album site, such as Shutterfly or
Ofoto. Here’s how they work. You log on with a Web browser, fill out a regis-
tration form, and then click a button to select the images you want to upload
from your hard drive. The images become instantly available on the site (to
anyone to whom you’ve given your user ID and password).

You don’t even have to optimize your pictures to make them download faster.
These sites want you to upload high-resolution images because those are
better for printing — and that’s how they make their money, selling prints
for 20 to 30 cents each. (Just beware that on a dial-up connection, it can take
several minutes to upload a big image file.)
The most popular free online photo album sites are Shutterfly (www.shutter
fly.com), Kodak’s Ofoto (www.ofoto.com), Yahoo Photos (photos.yahoo.
com), and You’ve Got Pictures (available only to AOL members).
The downside of these sites is that they don’t give you any choice about the
design for your photo album pages and little room for text to go with your
images. If you like the simplicity of an online service but want to create a Web
site that’s more advanced than an online photo album, consider using a serv-
ice such as family.myevent.com. For more on these and other services, see
Chapter 1.
If you want to create a custom Web site for your baby, read on. The rest of
this chapter is filled with instructions for creating your own baby site by 
personalizing the template pages and graphics on the CD.
Using the Templates on the CD
To make it easier for you to create a Web site, I’ve designed a template Web
site with graphics of a stork, a sun, and a baby bottle, in soft pastel blues and
yellows. A template is essentially a predesigned Web page that you can cus-
tomize by replacing the images and text with your own content. As the owner
of this book you are welcome to use the templates on the CD in any way you
like. You can make minor changes to insert your child’s pictures and name, or
you can make more dramatic changes, altering the graphics and page layout.
To keep things simple, I saved the page templates on the CD as basic HTML
files so you can edit them with any Web design program. 
In this chapter, you find out how to customize the templates in Microsoft
FrontPage 2003 and edit the images in Photoshop Elements 3.
If you prefer to use the Macromedia Dreamweaver MX 2004 program, visit
www.digitalfamily.com, where you’ll find step-by-step instructions for
using Dreamweaver to customize the baby Web site template.
All the template pages and images you need to create the design featured in
this chapter are on the CD that came with this book. To use them, insert the
CD into your computer and copy the contents of the Ch11 Baby Site folder
(located in the Author Files section of the CD) to your hard drive. Inside
that folder you’ll find three subfolders:
198
Part IV: Creating Special Project Sites 

 sample-baby-site contains a completed Web site you can use as a
model.
 template-baby-site contains the pages you should work with as you
create your own site.
 photoshop-files contains all the graphics for the site in their original
PSD format, which makes them easy to edit in Photoshop Elements.
When you copy images from a CD to your hard drive, you may find that the
files are locked, meaning you can’t save changes to them. To correct this on
a PC, right-click the Ch11 Baby Site folder and choose Properties. In the
Attributes area of the Properties dialog box, deselect the Read Only option.
Click Apply and then click OK. If you’re using a Mac, Ô-click the folder name,
choose Get Info, and deselect the Locked option.
Touring Baby Sites
As you see in Figure 11-1, the photos are the focus of the sample Web site,
which begins with a picture of Max the day he was born. The photo album
begins on the front page, but you can choose to create the photo album as a
subsection and include more text or multiple images on the front page. Either
way, the Next and Previous buttons help your visitors navigate through your
pages, and the buttons on the left can make it easy to jump to any of the main
sections. Using the template pages on the CD, you can add as many pages as
you want to your baby’s Web site and create new buttons for as many sec-
tions as you want.
If you have a large collection of images you want to add to your Web site,
you’ll appreciate the creation tools in Photoshop Elements 3.0. These tools
automate the process of resizing images and creating the pages and links.
You find instructions for creating Web photo galleries in Chapter 7.
Most baby Web sites feature lots of photos, as well as other relevant infor-
mation about a newborn — time and date of birth, weight, height, and other
details. In the template site for this chapter, I called that section Details, but
you can change the text on that button (as well as any of the other graphics
in this site) by following the instructions in the following section, “Editing the
Graphics for Your Baby Site.”
Another popular feature of a baby site is a gift registry (like the one shown in
Figure 11-2), where you can include links to online stores that offer gift registry
services. Shops such as Baby Gap and Pottery Barn Kids have everything you
need to create a registry and identify all the goodies you’d like for your child. If
you search Google with the words baby gift registry, you’ll find dozens of Web
sites that provide these services. Adding links to these sites is easy, as you’ll
see in the “Creating a Gift Registry” section later in this chapter.

Part IV: Creating Special Project Sites 

Before you build your own baby Web site, I encourage you to visit other baby
Web sites for ideas. One of the most impressive baby sites I’ve ever seen is
The Trixie Update at www.trixieupdate.com. Mori Central at www.mori
central.com is another great example of a site that showcases baby photos,
stories, and more.
Editing the Graphics for Your Baby Site
The button and banner graphics for this baby site use generic words, so you
don’t have to edit them. However, I encourage you to personalize the graph-
ics and make them your own. For example, the banner in the template folder
includes the text Introducing Our New Baby, but I changed the text in the
sample site (refer to Figure 11-2) to Introducing Max Goldberg.
In this section, I show you how to personalize the banner and buttons in the
template site. In the next section, you find out how to optimize photographs
and insert them into the photo frame included in the site’s design. You’ll find
that it’s easier to put your site together if you prepare all the graphics (photos,
buttons, and so on) before you start building your pages.
If you haven’t already copied the graphic files for this chapter from the CD,
insert the CD into your computer and copy the Author Files in the Ch11
Baby Site folder to your hard drive. Inside that folder, you’ll find a subfolder
called photoshop-files that contains all the graphics in their original
Photoshop Elements format (indicated by the .psd extension). These image
files are saved in a high-resolution format and include layers, which makes
them easier to edit than the optimized graphics in the images folder in the
template-baby-site folder.
If you don’t already have a graphics program that supports layers, I recom-
mend Photoshop Elements 3.0. If you use another image program, such as
Photoshop CS or Dreamweaver Fireworks, the editing techniques described
in this chapter will be similar but not identical.
Editing the banner graphic
At the top of the main page of the baby template Web site, I created a graphic
that features a sun and a stork and the words Introducing Our New Baby. In this
section, you personalize the graphic by replacing the words Our New Baby with
your baby’s name.
201
Chapter 11: It’s a Baby! Web Site

To add your baby’s name to the banner graphic, follow these steps:
1. Launch Photoshop Elements 3 (or any image design program that sup-
ports layers).
2. Open the banner.psd graphic in the photoshop-files folder.
Choose File➪Open and locate the file on your hard drive.
3. If the Layer’s palette is not already open, choose Window➪Layers to
open it.
The Layers palette opens on the right side of the screen, as shown in
Figure 11-3. Note that this graphic has four layers, called Stork, Baby
Name, Introducing, and Background. Before you can edit any part of this
graphic, you must first select the layer that corresponds to the section
you want to change.
4. In the Layers palette, click the Baby Name layer.
The Baby Name layer becomes shaded in a darker grey, indicating that
it’s the active layer, as shown in Figure 11-3.
5. Click the text tool (represented by a T) in the Tools palette on the left
side of the work area.
If the Tools palette is not open, choose Window➪Tools to open it.

6. Click and drag to highlight the words Our New Baby, and then type
your baby’s name.
The words Our New Baby disappear and your baby’s name appears in
their place. You can also use the Backspace and Delete keys to remove
the original text.
7. Use the text formatting options at the top of the work area to change
the font face, color, and font size.
In the banner image included on the CD, I used a 30-point, bold Comic
Sans MS font for the words Our New Baby. If you don’t have Comic Sans
or you want to change it, you can use any font you want.
8. Change other parts of the banner, as desired.
If you want to change the word Introducing, for example, click to select
the Introducing layer and repeat Steps 5 through 7. I used the same
Comic Sans MS font for the word Introducing, but reduced the point size
to 18. For more information on editing text in graphics and adjusting font
options, see Chapter 6.
9. To save your changes, choose File➪Save For Web.
The Save for Web dialog box opens.
10. In the Optimized File Format list, choose GIF, as shown in Figure 11-4.
The GIF format is the preferred file format for line art, such as cartoons
and logos, on the Web. (You find more on image formats for the Web in
Chapter 6.)
11. In the Colors box, set the number to 64.
Limiting the number of colors reduces the file size and makes the image
download more quickly. For an even smaller file size, reduce this number,
but don’t go too far or you’ll adversely affect the appearance of the image.
For more information on Web graphics options, see Chapter 6.
12. Click OK to save the new banner.
The Save Optimized As dialog box opens.
13. Save the file in the images folder in your Web site folder, and give it a
new name.
You can name the new banner anything you like as long as you don’t use
spaces or special characters.
Your new customized banner is now ready to be inserted in your Web page.
You’ll find instructions for doing so later in this chapter in the “Editing a tem-
plate page” section.
203
Chapter 11: It’s a Baby! Web Site

If you make changes to the banner that you’re not happy with and want to
start over again, you can always go back to the .psd file you were working on
before you saved the image as a GIF. If you really mess up and want to start
over, open the banner2.psd file. It’s the same as banner.psd. I added it to
the folder as a backup because I know how easy it is to make mistakes when
you’re just starting out in a program like Photoshop Elements. Similarly, I’ve
included button.psd and button2.psd graphics to give you a second chance
with that design as well. As a general rule, save a backup copy of any photo or
graphic before you start editing it.
Editing the button graphics
The buttons on this site are labeled My Album, Details, and Registry. Optimized
versions of all three are saved in the images folder, which is in the template-
baby-site folder, with the names button-album.gif, button-details.gif,
and button-registry.gif, respectively.
You can change the words on these buttons and you can create additional
buttons with new text, or you can skip this exercise and use any or all the
Figure 11-4:

graphic.
204
Part IV: Creating Special Project Sites 

predesigned buttons just as they are. (They’re already linked to their respec-
tive pages.) If you don’t want to use a particular button, simply delete it from
the template pages.
To keep text readable on buttons and banners, you need to be concise. The
fewer words the better and the shorter the words the better. For example,
don’t try to provide a long explanation like “Baby’s height, weight, and time
of birth” in a button. Instead, limit yourself to a simple word that conveys a
more general meaning, like “Details.”
To edit the text on the button.psd graphic, follow these steps.
1. Launch Photoshop Elements 3.
2. Open the button.psd graphic in the photoshop-files folder.
Choose File➪Open and locate the file on your hard drive.
3. If the Layers palette is not already open, choose Window➪Layers to
open it.
The button graphic has three layers, called Text, Bottle, and
Background, as shown in the Layers palette in Figure 11-5.

4. In the Layers palette, select the Text layer.
The Text layer becomes shaded a darker grey, indicating it is the active
layer.
5. Select the text tool (the T in the Tools palette).
If the Tools palette is not open, choose Window➪Tools to open it.
6. Highlight the words Button Text on the sample button, and then type
the text you want to use.
Your text replaces the words Button Text.
If you have trouble changing the text, try the following. Delete the Text
layer by dragging it to the small trash icon at the top of the page, click to
insert your cursor on the button, and type new text by using the text tool.
7. Use the text formatting options on the toolbar at the top of the work
area to change the font face, color, and font size, as shown in Fig-
ure 11-6.
I used a 13-point, bold, Comic Sans MS font for the buttons in this tem-
plate. If you change the font in one button, I recommend that you change
the font in all the buttons so that they look the same. For more informa-
tion on changing text in graphics, font options, and colors, see Chapter 6.

8. When you finish editing the button, choose File➪Save for Web.
The Save For Web dialog box opens.
9. In the Optimized File Format pull-down, choose GIF.
10. In the Colors box, set the number to 32.
Limiting the number of colors reduces the file size and makes the image
download more quickly. I’m using fewer colors in this image than I did
in the banner because the design is less complex and has less color 
variation.
11. Click OK to save the new button.
The Save Optimized As dialog box opens.
12. Save the file in the images folder in your Web site folder and give it a
new name.
Repeat these steps for each button you want to create. After you edit all the
button graphics, you’ll be ready to create the navigation area for your Web site.
Preparing Photos for Your Baby Site
In most families, new babies are a favorite photo subject. But before you put
those cute pictures on your Web site, you need to optimize them so they
download as quickly as possible for your visitors. You find more detailed
information about editing and optimizing images in Chapter 6, but to help
you get your baby site online as quickly as possible, the following steps walk
you through the basic process of resizing and converting photos to prepare
them for the Web so you can add photos to your baby site right away.
To resize and optimize a photo and insert it into the photo frame used in the
templates for the baby site featured in this chapter, follow these steps.
1. Launch Photoshop Elements 3.
2. Open one of the photo frame graphics in the photoshop-files folder
in the Ch11 Baby Site folder from the CD.
Choose File➪Open and locate the photo-frame graphic. For this template,
I’ve created three photo frames, one for tall photos (photo-frame-tall.
psd), one for wide photos (photo-frame-wide.psd), and one for photos
you’ve cropped into a square (photo-frame-square.psd).
3. In the Layers palette, click to select the Photo layer.
If the Layers palette isn’t open, choose Window➪Layers. All three photo
frame graphics have two layers called Photo Layer and Background, as
shown in Figure 11-7.
207
Chapter 11: It’s a Baby! Web Site

4. Open the photograph you want to use on your Web site.
Choose File➪Open, locate the photo on your hard drive, and double-
click to open the file.
5. Resize the photo to fit in the photo frame.
Choose Image➪Resize and specify the height and width you want in the
Image Size dialog box. For your images to fit into the photo frames for
this template, wide photos should be no larger than 320 x 215 pixels, tall
photos should be no larger than 180 x 275 pixels, and square photos
should be no larger than 210 x 210.
6. Copy the photo and paste it into the picture frame.
a. Click to select the move tool in the Tools palette.
b. Click to place your cursor anywhere in your photo file, and then
choose Select➪All.
c. Choose Edit➪Copy.
d. Click to place your cursor in the middle of the picture frame
image, and then choose Edit➪Paste.
Your photo appears in the picture frame and a new layer is created.
You can adjust the position of your photo by dragging it within the
picture frame image or by using the arrow keys on your keyboard.

208
Part IV: Creating Special Project Sites 

e. Delete the original Photo layer.
To do so, click to select the original Photo layer (the tan box) and
then drag it to the small trash can icon at the top of the Layers
palette.
f. Delete the Text layer.
7. Choose File➪Save For Web.
The Save For Web dialog box appears.
8. In the Optimized File Format list, choose JPEG.
9. Set the Quality to 80 percent.
Lowering the quality helps reduce the file size and makes the image down-
load more quickly. For an even smaller file size, reduce this number more,
but don’t go too far or you’ll adversely affect the appearance of the image.
10. Save the new photo in your Web site folder with a new name.
Repeat these steps for each photo you want to prepare for your site. Then
follow the steps in the next section to insert the images into your pages.
Creating a Baby Web Site by 
Using the Templates
The templates in this chapter were designed to make it easy to create a simple
Web site for a baby. Remember, though, that you can always add more pages
and even new sections to your site later.
To help you get started and make it easy for you to build a complete site
quickly, I created five template pages for your baby site:
 index.html is the main page.
 registry.html is the gift registry.
 details.html is where you list the baby’s height, weight, and other
information.
 album.html and album2.html are two photo album pages.
You can use any of these template pages. And you can create new pages
based on any of these page designs by choosing File➪Save As and giving the
page a new name.
If you want to edit the banner, buttons, or other graphics for this site, I suggest
you work on the images before you start building your pages. For instructions
209
Chapter 11: It’s a Baby! Web Site

on editing the image files in this site, see the “Editing the Graphics for Your
Baby Site” section, earlier in this chapter.
Opening the template site in FrontPage
Before you edit any pages of a Web site in FrontPage, you should first use the
Open Site command in FrontPage to identify your main Web site folder. Keep all
the files that you will use in your Web site in one main folder and then use sub-
folders to organize files within your site. Doing so makes it easier to upload the
files correctly to your server and helps FrontPage set the links properly. In the
following exercises you work with the files in the template-baby-site folder.
Follow these steps to open the main folder for your baby Web site in
FrontPage:
1. If you haven’t done so already, insert the CD that came with this book
into your computer’s CD drive and copy the folder called template-
baby-site from the Ch11 Baby Site folder onto your hard drive.
I also suggest you rename the folder something that has more meaning
for you, like Baby Jessica’s Web site. Also make sure that any new image
files you created in the earlier exercises are saved in the images folder
inside the main site folder before you continue with these steps.
2. Open the template site in FrontPage 2003 as you would open any
other Web site.
Choose File➪Open Site and locate the template-baby-site folder
(or whatever you named it) on your hard drive. Click to select the folder
and click Open to open the site in FrontPage. The Web site opens in
FrontPage and the files and subfolders are displayed in the Web Site
window, as shown in Figure 11-8.
Editing a template page
After you open the template site, you can begin to work on the individual pages
of the site. To edit the text in any of the template pages, follow these steps:
1. With the Web site open in FrontPage, as shown in Figure 11-8, double-
click the name of the file you want to edit.
If you choose index.html, the front page of the site opens.
The first page of any Web site must be named index.html, but the
other pages can be named anything you like, as long as you don’t use
any spaces or special characters.
210
Part IV: Creating Special Project Sites 

2. Highlight any text you want to replace on the page and type your own
words in its place.
This works much like replacing text in any word processing program.
Simply click and drag to select a word or words, use the Delete key to
delete the existing text, and then type to enter your own text. You can
also use the copy and paste function to copy text from another docu-
ment, such as a Word file, into a page in FrontPage.
3. Click File➪Save.
Any changes you made to the page are saved.
4. Choose File➪Preview in Browser.
The page is displayed in a Web browser. If you have more than one
browser on your computer, you may see multiple browser options, such
as Netscape and Internet Explorer. Choose the one that you prefer.
To edit the text on any of the pages in the site, follow the preceding instruc-
tions. For more information on FrontPage’s editing features, such as formatting
text and setting links, see Chapter 8.
Figure 11-8:

Open Site
feature in

211
Chapter 11: It’s a Baby! Web Site

To replace the images in any of the template pages, follow these steps:
1. Copy your photo files into the template-baby-site\images folder.
Before you link new photos into a Web site, it’s important that you first
copy all the image files to the images folder in the Web site folder. Copy
or move your image files the same way you would copy or move any
files from one folder to another on your computer’s hard drive.
2. With the Web site open in FrontPage, double-click the name of the file
you want to edit.
The page opens in the FrontPage work area. For example, if you choose
album.html, the first photo album page of the baby site opens.
3. With the Web page open in FrontPage, click to select the image you
want to replace. Then use the Delete key on your keyboard to delete
the image.
The image disappears from the page. Be careful not to move your cursor’s
location on the page before the next step because you want to insert the
new image in exactly the same place as the old one.
4. Choose Insert➪Picture➪From File, locate the image you want to use
on your hard drive, and click to select the image.
The new image appears in place of the old one. In the example in Fig-
ure 11-9, I replaced the photo-frame image in the photo album page
with a photograph of Max and his mother.
5. Repeat Steps 2 through 4 to replace any other images on the page.
6. Choose File➪Save.
Any changes you made to the page are saved.
7. Choose File➪Preview in Browser.
The page is displayed in a Web browser.
To replace images in any other pages in the site, follow the same instructions.
For more information on working with images in FrontPage, see Chapter 8.
Creating and changing links
The Next and Previous buttons in the photo album pages are already set to
link from one to the next, with the third page linking back to the first page.
If you add photo album pages, you need to adjust these links accordingly.
212
Part IV: Creating Special Project Sites 

To change or create a link from one page on your site to another, follow these
steps:
1. With the Web site open in FrontPage, double-click the name of the file
you want to edit.
If you choose album2.html, the second album page of the baby template
site opens. The template page contains a blank image that you should
replace with your own picture. In Figure 11-10, you see the page after I’ve
inserted a photograph of Max and his father, Zach, who is playing monster
for the camera.
2. Click to select any image or text you want to use to create a link.
The selected image or text is highlighted. In the example, I selected the
Next button.
3. With the image or text area still selected, click the Insert Hyperlink
icon on the standard toolbar.
(The icon is labeled with a tooltip in Figure 11-10.) The Edit Hyperlink
dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 11-11.
Figure 11-9:
Replace the
graphics in
the template
pages with
your own
photos.
213
Chapter 11: It’s a Baby! Web Site

4. Browse to find the page you want to link to, and click the file name to
select it.
In the example, I created a link to a new photo album page, which I called
album3.html. I encourage you to use numbers in file names for photo
album pages because it makes it easier to keep track of the sequence as
you create links.

214
Part IV: Creating Special Project Sites 

5. Click OK to close the dialog box.
The link is set.
6. Choose File➪Save.
Any changes you made to the page are saved.
7. Choose File➪Preview in Browser.
The page is displayed in a Web browser.
8. Click the image or text where you created the link to test your work.
If you set the link properly, the page you linked to opens in the browser.
It’s a good idea to test your links because it’s so easy to set them incor-
rectly (especially when you’re linking a series of pages to create a photo
album). Although you’re using the browser to view pages on your hard
drive, the links should work just as they will when the pages are published
on the Internet.
For more information about creating links in FrontPage, such as how to
create links to other Web sites or to e-mail addresses, see Chapter 8.
Creating or deleting pages
To further customize your baby Web site, you can add or delete pages. To
delete a page, simply click to select the file name of the page in the Web Site
window in FrontPage and press the Delete key on your keyboard.
If you remove a page or section, make sure that you also delete any naviga-
tion buttons that link to that page. For example, if you decide not to include
a gift registry on your site, you should delete the registry.html page and
delete the Registry button on each page in which it appears. (To delete the
button, simply click to select it and press Delete.) When you delete the button,
the link is removed automatically. If you add or remove photo album pages,
you may need to adjust the Next and Back button links accordingly. Use the
instructions in the preceding section to create new links.
To add new pages, choose the template page that is most like the page you
want to add, and then choose File➪Save As to create a copy. Give the new
page a new name so that you don’t overwrite the existing page. After you
save a copy of the page, you can make changes to it in FrontPage without
affecting the original page.
215
Chapter 11: It’s a Baby! Web Site

Creating a gift registry
The links in the gift registry page are special because instead of linking to
another page on your Web site, they link directly to your personalized gift
registry page within the store’s Web site.
To create a link to another Web site, such as an online store with a gift reg-
istry section, follow these steps:
1. Open the file in FrontPage where you want to create a link to another
Web site.
To create your gift registry links, open registry.html.
2. Click to select the image or text you want to use to create the link, and
then click the Insert Hyperlink icon on the standard toolbar.
You can create your gift registry links with text, such as the name of
each store (refer to the sample site in Figure 11-2). 
3. In the Address box of the Insert Hyperlink dialog box, insert the URL
of the page you want to link to.
If you’re not sure of the URL or you don’t want to type it, you can use the
Browse the Web option (you have to be connected to the Internet for this
to work). To use this feature, click the Browse the Web icon (it looks like
a globe with a magnifying glass) at the top of the Insert Hyperlink dialog
box. FrontPage launches Internet Explorer. Navigate in IE to find the page
you want to link to. Then, leave that page displayed in the browser and
switch back to FrontPage. The URL is automatically inserted into the
Address box.
If you prefer to enter the URL by copying and pasting (perhaps because
you already have the page displayed in a browser and don’t want to have
to go through all the steps of logging into your registry to open it again),
see the instructions on copying a URL into the Insert Hyperlink dialog
box in Chapter 12.
4. Click OK to close the dialog box.
The link is set.
5. Choose File➪Save.
Any changes you made to the page are saved.
6. Choose File➪Preview in Browser.
The page is displayed in a Web browser.
7. To test your work, click the link.
Repeat these instructions to link to additional gift registries and other Web
sites.
216
Part IV: Creating Special Project Sites 

Publishing Your Web Site
You should always test your work before you put it up for all the world to see
on the Internet. Before you publish your site to a server, preview it in a browser
and test the links and images to make sure they look good and work properly.
Ideally, you should have someone else test it as well because a fresh eye often
catches things we miss in our own work. If you know someone with a good eye
for detail, have that person read your text, too. To preview your site with a
browser, open the first page of the site in FrontPage and choose File➪Preview
in Browser.
To publish your Web site on the Internet, you need a Web server, such as
those offered by commercial service providers (you find suggestions for
choosing a service provider in Chapter 4). After you set up an account with
a service provider, you simply transfer the files you created from your hard
drive to the server. You find instructions for using FrontPage to send your
site to your server at the end of Chapter 8.
If you want more instructions for editing your pages than I’ve provided in this
chapter, check out Chapter 8, which provides a basic FrontPage tutorial. If
you want to get into more advanced editing and design with FrontPage, I rec-
ommend FrontPage 2003 For Dummies by Asha Dornfest (Wiley Publishing).

S
omething old, something new, something borrowed, and now you better
have something on the Internet too. Wedding Web sites have become an
important part of the planning process and a vital place for guests to find
everything from maps to your online gift registry.
The instructions in this chapter combine with the templates and images pro-
vided on the CD to help you create the important sections of your Web site —
from the invitation to the wedding photo album. I know you have plenty of
details to worry about, so my goal is to make building your wedding Web site
as easy as possible.
With that in mind, if you want the easiest, fastest one-stop-shopping kind of
solution for your wedding Web site needs, consider using a service such as
the one at family.myevent.com. Although your design options are limited
to their templates and they charge a monthly fee, MyEvent.com provides
everything you need for your Web site in one place; you don’t even have to
install any software on your computer. For more on this and other similar 
services, see Chapter 1 or visit family.myevent.com.
The instructions in this chapter show you how to edit the graphics in this
site in Photoshop Elements 3, and how to edit template pages in Microsoft
FrontPage 2003. If you prefer to use the Macromedia Dreamweaver MX 2004
program, visit www.digitalfamily.com, where you’ll find instructions for
using Dreamweaver to customize this wedding Web site template.

Touring Wedding Sites
I’ve created a sample wedding site based on the template for this chapter and
included the sample pages on the CD as a model. As you see in Figure 12-1,
this site features a photo of the bride and groom on the first page, as well as
a place to list the people in the wedding party.
The sample site in this chapter features pictures from Scott and Kelly’s wed-
ding. Before the wedding, the most important information to have on the site
is directions and a gift registry. After the wedding, you may want to go back
and add images taken during the ceremony. (Special thanks to photographer
Zach Goldberg of www.frozenfoto.com for letting me use his beautiful
images in this chapter and others.)
Many people like to keep the gift registry on their site even after the wedding
date, to give guests a chance to send late gifts.
The templates for this chapter are designed to help you create the most
common pages in a wedding site — the invitation, directions, and registry
pages. You can always add or remove pages and change the design as much
as you like.

Part IV: Creating Special Project Sites 

Maps and instructions for finding your wedding and reception locations are
probably the most valuable resources you can include on a wedding site. In
addition to writing out the directions, you may want to link directly to a map
at Yahoo Maps (maps.yahoo.com) or Mapquest (www.mapquest.com).
You can also make it easier for your friends and family to buy you presents
(and what’s better for them may also be better for you.) Most wedding Web
sites include a page with links to online stores and other Web sites that offer
gift registry services. Shops such as Williams Sonoma and Macy’s make it easy
to create your own gift registry and identify the place settings and home fur-
nishings you’d like as you start your new life together. If you search Google.
com with the words wedding gift registry, you’ll find dozens of Web sites that
provide gift registry services. Adding links to these sites is easy, as you’ll see
in the “Creating a link to another Web site” section later in this chapter.
Even before the wedding, you can create a wedding album section, like the
one shown in Figure 12-2, and feature photos of the engaged couple and even
the bachelor party (if you’re not too embarrassed). Creating a section for the
photo album now lets your visitors know that this is the place to come back
to later to see the wedding photos — and saves you time later when you’re
anxious to put those wedding photos online.

Chapter 12: Happily Ever After: Creating a Wedding Site

Ready to dive in and create your own wedding Web site? Before you get
started on your own site, spend some time looking at other Web sites. You
can find lots of great ones at www.topweddingsites.com.
Preparing Photos for Your Wedding Site
Unlike most of the other template Web sites in this part of the book, this site
was designed so that you don’t have to edit the buttons or headings as graph-
ics. Instead, these elements were created as text, which you can edit in a Web
design program. (You find instructions for doing that in the “Creating Your
Wedding Site” section, later in this chapter.)
In this section, you find out how to optimize photographs and insert them
into the photo frame included in the site’s design. I encourage you to do this
before you start building your pages because it’s easier to create your site
when the images are prepared.
If you don’t have a graphics program that supports layers, I recommend
Photoshop Elements, which I used for the exercises in this chapter. You can
also use another image program, such as Photoshop CS or Dreamweaver
Fireworks. The process will be similar, but you may need to make minor
adjustments to the steps in this section.
Before you get started, insert the CD that came with this book into your com-
puter’s CD drive and copy the author files from the Ch12 Wedding Site
folder onto your hard drive. To help you design your site, I’ve included three
folders in the Ch12 Wedding Site folder:

When you copy images from a CD to your hard drive, you may find that the
files are locked, meaning you can’t save changes to them. To correct this on a
PC, right-click the Ch12 Wedding Site folder and choose Properties. In the
Attributes area of the Properties dialog box, uncheck the Read Only option.
Click Apply and then click OK. If you’re using a Mac, Ô-click the folder name,
choose Get Info, and uncheck the Locked option.
Before you put any photos on your Web site, you need to optimize them so
they will download as quickly as possible for your visitors. (If you’re not sure
222
Part IV: Creating Special Project Sites 

what I mean by that, you find more detailed information about editing and
optimizing images in Chapter 6.) The steps in this section walk you through
the basic process of resizing and optimizing photos so you can add them to
the templates and create a photo album for this site right away.
To resize and optimize a photo and insert it into the photo frame used in the
wedding site templates, follow these steps.
1. Launch Photoshop Elements 3.
2. Open one of the photo frame graphics in the photoshop-files folder,
which is in the Ch12 Wedding Site folder on the CD.
Choose File➪Open and locate the file on your hard drive. For this tem-
plate, I created three photo frames, one for tall photos (photo-frame-
tall.psd), one for wide photos (photo-frame-wide.psd), and one for
photos you’ve cropped into a square (photo-frame-square.psd).
3. If the Layers palette isn’t open, choose Window➪Layers.
The Layers palette opens in the right side of the screen. Each of the
photo frame images has two layers, called Photo layer and Background.
In Figure 12-3 you see the photo-frame-wide.psd file open in Elements.
Before you can change a part of any graphic, you must first select the
layer that corresponds to it.
4. In the Layers palette, select the Photo layer.
The Photo layer becomes shaded in a darker grey, indicating it is the
active layer.
5. Open the photograph you want to use on your Web site.
Choose File➪Open, locate the photo on your hard drive, and double-
click to open it. In Figure 12-3 you see both the photo frame image and
a photograph open at the same time in Photoshop Elements. You can
open multiple images in Photoshop Elements, making it easy to copy the
contents of one graphic into another.
6. Resize the photo so that it fits in the photo frame.
Choose Image➪Resize and specify the height and width you want in the
Image Size dialog box. If you want to insert your photo into the photo
frame designed for this template, you need to make it the same size or
smaller than the tan or purple area that appears in the sample image.
Wide photos should be no larger than 325 by 240 pixels, and tall photos
should be no larger than 240 by 315 pixels. The smaller frame used on
the front page requires a photo no larger than 260 by 165.
223
Chapter 12: Happily Ever After: Creating a Wedding Site

7. Copy and paste the photo into the picture frame image.
a. Select the move tool from the Tools palette.
b. Click to place your cursor anywhere in your photo file and then
choose Select➪All.
c. Choose Edit➪Copy.
d. Click to place your cursor in the middle of the picture frame
image and then choose Edit➪Paste.
Your photo appears in the picture frame and a new layer is cre-
ated. You can adjust the position of your photo by clicking and
dragging it within the picture frame image or by using the arrow
keys on your keyboard.
e. Delete the original Photo layer.
To do so, select the original Photo layer (the tan box) and drag it
to the small trash can at the top of the Layers palette.
f. Delete the original Photo layer.
For more information about resizing an image or using copy and
paste to copy an image from one file to another, see Chapter 6.

224
Part IV: Creating Special Project Sites 

8. Choose File➪Save For Web.
The Save for Web dialog box opens.
9. In the Optimized File Format pull-down list, choose JPEG.
10. Set the Quality to 80 percent.
Lowering the quality helps reduce the file size and make the image down-
load more quickly. For an even smaller file size, reduce this number 
further, but don’t go too far or you’ll adversely affect the appearance
of the image.
11. Save the new photo in your Web site folder with a new name.
You can name the photo anything you like as long as you don’t use
spaces or special characters.
Repeat these steps for each photo you want to prepare for your site. Then
follow the steps in the next section to insert these images into your pages.
Creating Your Wedding Site
I designed the templates for this chapter to include the kinds of common fea-
tures you’re likely to want on a wedding site. In the template-wedding-site
folder, you find a predesigned page for the front page, which includes a place
for a photo and the names of those in the wedding party. You also find sepa-
rate template page designs for the ceremony, directions, and a gift registry, as
well as pages designed for a photo album.
The templates are predesigned Web pages that you can customize by simply
replacing the images and text with your own content. (FrontPage offers two
special template formats, which you can find out about in Chapter 9.) To
keep things simple, I’ve saved the templates as basic HTML files so you can
edit them with any Web design program and quickly turn them into your own
Web site. If you’re planning to build a larger, more complicated Web site and
want to create lots of new pages with these same designs, you may want to
save the page designs as FrontPage templates. For more information, see the
instructions in Chapter 9.
To help you get started and make it easy for you to build a complete site
quickly, I created eight template pages for your wedding site:
 index.html is the front page.
 invitation.html is the invitation.
 directions.html is the directions page.
225
Chapter 12: Happily Ever After: Creating a Wedding Site

 ceremony.html is the ceremony page.
 album1.html, album2.html, and album3.html are the photo album.
 registry.html is the gift registry.
By naming these files so that they correspond to their contents, it makes it
easier to identify the pages later when you want to work on them.
The main page of any Web site must be named index.html, but the rest of
the pages can be named anything you like, as long as you don’t use spaces or
special characters and you use the .html extension at the end of every page.
You can create new or additional pages for your site from any of the templates
on the CD by choosing File➪Save As and using a new name to the new file (just
make sure you keep the .html extension).
Starting with the Open Site process
FrontPage works best when you use the program’s Open Site feature to iden-
tify your Web site folder before you edit any pages. Keep the files for your
Web site in one folder — doing so makes it easier to upload the files to your
server later and helps FrontPage set the links properly.
You’ll be working with the files in the template-wedding-site folder. You
may want to begin by renaming that folder something else, such as Our
Wedding Site, so you can identify it more easily on your hard drive.
Follow these steps to use the FrontPage Open Site command to open the tem-
plate folder for the wedding Web site:
1. If you haven’t done so already, insert the CD that came with this book
into your computer’s CD drive and copy the folder called template-
wedding-site from the Ch12 Wedding Site folder to your hard drive.
2. Open the template site in FrontPage as you would open any other Web
site.
Choose File➪Open Site and locate the template-wedding-site folder
(or whatever you named it) on your hard drive. Click to select the folder
and then click Open in the Open Site dialog box. The Web site opens
in FrontPage and the files and subfolders are displayed, as shown in
Figure 12-4.
226
Part IV: Creating Special Project Sites 

Editing a template page
After you open the template site, you can begin to work on the individual
pages of the site.
To edit the text in any of the template pages, follow these steps:
1. With the Web site open in FrontPage, as shown in Figure 12-4, double-
click the name of the file you want to edit.
For example, if you choose directions.html, the directions page of the
wedding template site opens.
2. Highlight any text you want to replace on the page and type your own
words in its place.
The process is similar to replacing text in any word processing program.
Simply click and drag to select a word or words, use the Delete key to
delete the existing text, and then type to enter your own text. You can
also use the copy and paste function to copy text from another docu-
ment, such as a Word file, into a page in FrontPage.

227
Chapter 12: Happily Ever After: Creating a Wedding Site

Be careful when you delete text in these predesigned pages because it’s
easy to delete more than you intend, altering other aspects of the page.
If that happens, choose Edit➪Undo to reverse the step. If you really
mess up the design (which is easy to do, especially when you’re new
at this), you can always copy the page from the CD to your hard drive
again and start over.
3. Choose File➪Save.
Any changes you made to the page are saved.
4. Choose File➪Preview in Browser.
The page is displayed in a Web browser.
Follow these instructions to edit the text on any of the other pages in the site.
For more information on editing pages with FrontPage, see Chapter 8.
Adding images to your pages
Adding and replacing images on a Web pages is almost as easy as editing the
text. To replace an image in any of the template pages, follow these steps:
1. Copy your photo files into the images folder in your main wedding
Web site folder.
The main folder is called template-wedding-site unless you’ve
renamed it.
Before you link new photos into a Web site, it’s important that you first
copy all the image files into the images folder in the Web site folder so
that the links to the images will be set properly. If you don’t do this, your
images may not display properly when you transfer the site to a Web
server. Copy or move your image files the same way you copy or move
any files from one folder to another on your computer’s hard drive.
2. With the Web site open in FrontPage, double-click the name of the
template or other HTML page you want to edit.
The page opens in the FrontPage work area. In the example, shown in
Figure 12-5, I’ve opened the template page called ceremony.html.
3. Click to select the image you want to replace.
The image is selected in the work area.
4. Press the Delete key on your keyboard to delete the image.
The image disappears. Be careful not to move your cursor — in the next
step, you insert the new image in the same place as the old one.
228
Part IV: Creating Special Project Sites 

5. Choose Insert➪Picture➪From File, locate the image you want to use
on your hard drive, and click to select the image.
The new image appears in place of the old one.
6. Repeat Steps 3 through 5 to replace any other images on the page.
7. Choose File➪Save.
Any changes you made to the page are saved.
8. Choose File➪Preview in Browser.
The page is displayed in a Web browser.
To replace images in any other pages on the site, open the page you want to
edit and follow these same instructions. For more information on working
with images in FrontPage, see Chapter 8.
Changing and adding links
Creating links from one page on your site to another, especially in a program
like FrontPage, is much easier than most new Web designers imagine. In the
following exercise, I show you how to create a link from the photo album
Figure 12-5:
To insert an

229
Chapter 12: Happily Ever After: Creating a Wedding Site

page (album.html) to another photo album page called album2. You can use
these same instructions to create a link from any page on your site to another,
such as a new page with the bride and groom’s vows linked to the ceremony
page.
To change or create a link, follow these steps:
1. With the Web site open in FrontPage, double-click the name of the file
in which you want to create or change a link.
In the example shown in Figure 12-6, I chose album.html.
It’s a good idea to create the pages you want to link to before you create
the links. In this example, I opened the album.html file, and chose File➪
Save As to create a new page that I named album2.html. Then I used
File➪Save As again and created album3.html. Next, I opened each file
separately and inserted a different image in each file.
2. Click to select the image or text that you want to use to create a link,
and then click the Insert Hyperlink icon on the standard toolbar.
In Figure 12-6, I selected the Next button.
3. In the Insert Hyperlink dialog box, browse to find the page you want
to link to, and then click the page’s file name to select it.

230
Part IV: Creating Special Project Sites 

4. Click OK to close the dialog box.
The link is set. In the example, I created a link to a new photo album
page, which I named album2.html. Using numbers in file names for
photo album pages makes it easier to keep track of the sequence as you
create links.
5. Click File➪Save.
Any changes you made to the page are saved.
6. Choose File➪Preview in Browser.
The page is displayed in a Web browser. It’s always a good idea to test
your links because it’s so easy to set them incorrectly (especially when
you’re linking a series of pages to create a photo album).
7. Test your work by clicking the new link.
If you set the link properly, the page you linked to opens in the browser.
Although you’re using the browser to view pages on your hard drive, the
links should work just as they will when the pages are published to the
Internet as long as you keep all your pages in the same folder when you
transfer them to the server.
For more information on creating links with FrontPage, such as how to create
links to other Web sites or to e-mail addresses, see Chapter 8.
Deleting pages from your site
If you decide that you don’t want to use a page in the template wedding site,
just delete it. To delete a page, click to select the page’s file name in the Web
Site window in FrontPage (refer to Figure 12-4), and press the Delete key.
If you remove a page or section, make sure that you also delete any navigation
buttons that link to that page. For example, if you want to delete the invita-
tion page, you need to open each of the pages in the site with a link to the
invitation page, click to select the button or text that links to that page, and
delete it. When you delete the graphic or text that is linked, you automati-
cally remove the link as well.
Creating a link to another Web site
Linking to a page in another Web site is similar to linking to a page within your
own site. But instead of using the Insert Hyperlink dialog box to browse for a
page on your hard drive, you insert the URL of the site you want to link to.
Two places where you’re likely to want to create links to other Web sites are
the directions page, where you may want to link to a map on a site such as
231
Chapter 12: Happily Ever After: Creating a Wedding Site

Mapquest.com, and the gift registry page, where you’ll want to link directly
to your gift registry sites. When you create the link, it’s easier to use copy
and paste to insert the URL rather than type a long, complicated address.
You find instructions for using copy and paste to create a link in the following
exercise.
To create a link to another Web site, follow these steps:
1. Open the file in FrontPage where you want to create a link to another
Web site.
I chose directions.html because I want to add a link to a Mapquest.
com map to the reception.
2. Click to select the image or text you want to use to create the link and
then click the Insert Hyperlink icon on the standard toolbar.
I selected the words map to the reception.
3. In the Address area of the Insert Hyperlink dialog box, insert the URL
of the page you want to link to.
If you’re not sure of the URL or you don’t want to type it, you can use the
Browse the Web option (you have to be connected to the Internet for this
to work). To use this feature, click the Browse the Web icon (it looks like
a globe with a magnifying glass) at the top of the Insert Hyperlink dialog
box. FrontPage launches Internet Explorer. Navigate in IE to find the page
you want to link to. Then leave that page displayed in the browser and
switch back to FrontPage. The URL is automatically inserted into the
Address box.
If you prefer to enter the URL by copying and pasting (perhaps because
you already have the page displayed in a browser and don’t want to
have to go through the steps of logging into your registry to open it
again), see the instructions on copying a URL into the Insert Hyperlink
dialog box in the following section, “Copying a URL to create a link.”
4. Click OK to close the dialog box.
5. Choose File➪Save.
Any changes you made to the page are saved.
6. Choose File➪Preview in Browser.
The page is displayed in a Web browser.
7. To test your work, click the link.
If you set the link properly and are connected to the Internet, the site you
linked to will open in the browser, even though the page you’re working
on is on your computer and not yet published on the Web. That’s because
a link to a URL simple instructs a browser to open the address of the Web
site, irrespective of where the page with the link is located.
232
Part IV: Creating Special Project Sites 

For more information about creating links with FrontPage, such as how to
create links to other Web sites or to email addresses, see Chapter 8.
Copying a URL to create a link
You can save a lot of time and tedious typing by using the copy and paste
functions to insert a URL in the Insert Hyperlink dialog box when creating a
link to another Web site.
This is an especially valuable trick when you’re linking to a gift registry page
or to a specific map, because these links are long, complicated addresses
designed to take a visitor directly to a customized page on the site.
To use copy and paste instead of trying to retype the address, follow these
steps:
1. Open a browser, such as Internet Explorer, and enter the URL of the
Web site you want to visit.
For example, enter www.mapquest.com to visit the map site.
2. Place your cursor at the beginning of the address line in your
browser.
Make sure you’re at the very beginning of the address so you don’t miss
any of it. You can use the arrow keys on your keyboard to adjust the
location of your cursor.
3. Click and drag to select the entire URL (make sure you don’t miss any
part of it), and then choose Edit➪Copy.
Although you won’t see anything happen, the URL is copied and saved
to your computer’s clipboard.
4. Open the page where you want to create the link in FrontPage.
You can have multiple computer programs open at once on your com-
puter so you can more easily switch from a page in FrontPage to your
browser and back.
5. With the text or image that you want to link selected in FrontPage,
click the Edit Hyperlink icon.
6. In the Insert Hyperlink dialog box, click to place your cursor in the
Address area, and choose Edit➪Paste.
The URL you copied from the browser appears in the address line.
7. Click OK to close the Insert Hyperlink dialog box.
The link is created.
233
Chapter 12: Happily Ever After: Creating a Wedding Site

8. Choose File➪Preview in Browser.
The page is displayed in a Web browser.
9. Click the image or text where you created the link to test your work.
Publishing Your Web Site
You should always test your work before you put it up for all the world to see
on the Internet. To preview your site with a browser, open the first page of
your site in FrontPage, choose File➪Preview in Browser, and then systemati-
cally click the links to make sure they go where you intended. If you find a
broken or misdirected link, open the page with the bad link in FrontPage and
recreate the link correctly. (You find instructions in the “Changing and adding
links” section, earlier in this chapter.) Check the images as well, to make sure
they look good and work properly.
If you know someone with a good eye for detail, ask that person to test your
site too — and to check the text for typos, misspellings, or other errors that
can make your pages more difficult to understand. I suggest you publish your
Web site online and then send the address to a few close friends or family so
that they can check the site for you. After you get their feedback, make any
necessary changes to the site, and then send out a broad announcement.
To publish your Web site on the Internet, you need a Web server, such as
those offered by commercial service providers (you find suggestions for
choosing a service provider in Chapter 4). After you have set up an account
with a service provider, you simply transfer the files you created from your
hard drive to the server. You find instructions for using FrontPage to send
your site to your server at the end of Chapter 8.
If you want more instructions for editing your pages than I provide in this
chapter, Chapter 8 provides a basic FrontPage tutorial. If you want to get into
advanced editing and design with FrontPage, I recommend FrontPage 2003 For
Dummies by Asha Dornfest (published by Wiley).

I
f your family is anything like mine, you’ve had to sit through your share of
family vacation slide shows and spend hours looking through snapshots
from camping trips, cruises, and other adventures.
Sharing travel photos is nothing new, but the modern computer is replacing
the old slide projector and more and more families are now using travel Web
sites to share their stories. Equipped with a digital camera and a laptop,
adventure travelers, especially those on extended trips, are creating detailed
sites — often before they even return home.
In this chapter, I introduce you to the world of travel Web sites with a sample
site created by my friend Ken Riddick to show off his amazing underwater
photography from a scuba diving adventure. Ken graciously agreed to let me
share his photos and Web site in the book. I used his site as a model for the
templates that go with this chapter, so you can create a similar site with your
travel photos — even if you take them on land. The templates and graphics
shown in this chapter are on the CD, in the Ch13 Travel Site folder in the
Author Files section.

Inside that folder you’ll find three subfolders:
 sample-travel-site contains a complete Web site you can use as a
model.
 template-travel-site contains the pages you should work with as
you create your own site.
 photoshop-files has all the graphics for the site in their original .psd
format, which makes them easy to edit in Photoshop Elements.
In the following pages, you create an image montage to showcase many
photos on one page. You also find out how to optimize images so they down-
load quickly on the Web and how to create a virtual slide show against a
black background so your pictures really stand out on your pages. You use
Microsoft FrontPage 2003 to customize the pages of this template site and
Photoshop Elements 3 to edit the graphics.
If you prefer to use Macromedia Dreamweaver MX 2004, visit www.digital
family.com, where you’ll find instructions for using Dreamweaver to cus-
tomize the travel Web site.
When you copy images from a CD to your hard drive, you may find that the
files are locked, so you can’t save changes to them. To correct this on a PC,
right-click the Ch13 Travel Site folder and choose Properties. In the
Attributes area of the Properties dialog box, deselect he Read Only option.
Click Apply and then click OK. If you’re using a Mac, Ô-click the folder name,
choose Get Info, and deselect the Locked option.

Part IV: Creating Special Project Sites 
Putting photos online the easy way
I’ve tried to make it as easy as possible for you
to create a travel Web site in this chapter. But if
all you want to do is show off your photos, here
are a couple of alternatives that are much faster
and easier.
If you’re not concerned about the design and
just want to make your photos accessible over
the Internet, consider using an online photo site,
such as Ofoto.com or Shutterfly.com.
These sites make it easy to upload your photos,
and they automatically create a simple online
photo album. They provide this service for free
and make their money by trying to convince you
and your visitors to use their services to print
the photos (20 to 30 cents each).
If you want to create something more advanced
than an online photo album but not as compli-
cated as creating your own custom site like the
one described in this chapter, consider using a
service such as family.myevent.com. For
more on this and other similar services, see
Chapter 1.

Taking Your Visitors with You
Before you start building your own Web travel site, I encourage you to visit a
few others for ideas. For a look at a site by a family of true adventure travel-
ers, visit www.rfleming.net and discover how mom, dad, and two little girls
spent two years circling the globe.
To get a glimpse of the deep and an idea of the kind of Web site you can create
with the templates for this chapter, take a tour of Ken’s scuba site at
www.counsinswest.com/fpdiving
Ken’s Web site is made up of a colorful collection of underwater photos that
come to life against the black background of his pages. No matter what the
subject of your travel site, you can appreciate the simple but effective design
principals he uses to invite you into his site and take you on your own under-
water adventure.
As you see in Figure 13-1, Ken’s front page features a photomontage made up
of eight images. Notice how he’s edited the images so that they’re not the
same size, a key factor in making the montage graphically interesting.
Figure 13-1:
A photo-

a great way
to show off

Chapter 13: Wish You Were Here: Vacation Sites

He’s also used a large font and white letters for the words Diving French
Polynesia, and he’s carefully placed the letters against dark parts of the
images so there’s enough contrast for the text to be readable.
One of the challenges of placing text over an image is that the words can get
lost when set against a busy background. The safest options are light-colored
letters against a dark area in an image or dark letters against a light area. For
example, you might use dark burgundy letters against a sandy stretch of
beach, or bright yellow letters over the darkest part of a photo of a sunset.
Below the montage, as you can see in Figure 13-2, Ken has written a brief
introduction to the site, which explains where French Polynesia is and what
he saw there. Moreover, he tells visitors how many photos are in the slide
show and how to navigate through the pages. In addition to the Next and
Previous links on each page, each photo in the montage is linked to a larger
version of the image.

Part IV: Creating Special Project Sites 

Preparing the Photos for Your Web Site
Most travel Web sites feature lots of photos, and preparing those images
should be the first step in creating a Web site. In the following exercise, you
find out how to crop a photo, resize it to fit a design, and save it in the right
format for the Web. Cropping is especially important on the Web because you
generally have to reduce the size of an image for it to display well on a com-
puter screen. Trimming the edges of an image enables you to focus your
viewer’s attention on the most important parts of a picture.
The following steps will walk you through the process of cropping, resizing,
and optimizing a photograph for your travel site:
1. Launch Photoshop Elements 3.
2. Open the photograph you want to prepare for your Web site.
Choose File➪Open and locate the file on your hard drive.
3. Crop out any unnecessary or distracting elements in the image.
a. Click to select the cropping tool in the Tools palette.
b. Click to place your cursor in your photo and drag to draw a box
where you want to make the crop.
c. Use the small squares at the corners of the box to adjust the
cropping area, as shown in Figure 13-3.
d. Double-click the center of the image to complete the crop.
The area outside the cropping square is removed.
4. Resize the photo.
Choose Image➪Resize➪Image Size and specify the height and width you
want in the Image Size dialog box. To fit the design in the sample site,
make horizontal photos no more than 375 pixels wide, and vertical
photos no more than 275 pixels wide. If you keep the Aspect Ratio
option checked, the height of your images will automatically adjust to
remain proportional to the width you specify.
5. Choose File➪Save For Web.
The Save for Web dialog box opens.
6. In the Optimized File Format pull-down, choose JPEG.
JPEG is best for photographs on the Web, and GIF is best for images with
limited colors, such as buttons and logos.
239
Chapter 13: Wish You Were Here: Vacation Sites

7. Set the Quality to 80 percent.
Lowering the quality reduces the file size and makes the image down-
load more quickly. For an even smaller file size, reduce this number
more; but don’t go too far or you’ll adversely affect the appearance of
the image. For information on optimizing graphics for the Web, see
Chapter 6.
8. Save the new photo into your Web site folder and give it a new name.
Repeat these steps for each photo you want to prepare for your site.
Then follow the steps in the next section to create a photomontage. For
more information about cropping, resizing, and retouching your images,
see Chapter 6.
Creating a Photomontage
A photomontage is a great way to show off several photos at once and makes
an ideal centerpiece for the front page of a travel site. The montage Ken uses
on his front page is stunning, but it’s also complicated and big. Ken can get
away with that because he knows most of the people who visit his site have
fast connections to the Internet and nice big monitors. I don’t assume that’s
the case for everyone who will visit your site, so for this exercise, I created a

on the Web.
240
Part IV: Creating Special Project Sites 

much simpler design for a montage. I also built a color-coded frame (see
Figure 13-4) to make it easy for you to follow along. You’ll find the image in
the photoshop-files folder. The file is called montage-design.psd.
In case creating a montage seems too complicated or you don’t want to take
the time to create a personalized banner, I’ve created a banner with a diverse
collection of travel photos designed to go with any travel site. The banner is in
the images folder of the template-travel-site folder. You can skip the fol-
lowing section and use the completed banner if you prefer. (You find out how
to insert a banner into the main page of your travel site in the “Customizing
the Sample Template Site” section, later in this chapter.)
Preparing images for the montage
To create this montage, you need to select four photos to feature in the design.
In the following exercise, I show you how to resize your images and fit them
into the montage:
1. Launch Photoshop Elements 3.
2. Open all four of the photographs you want to include in your montage.

Chapter 13: Wish You Were Here: Vacation Sites

Choose File➪Open and locate each file on your hard drive. You can have
multiple image files open at once, but you can work on only one image at
a time. You can switch from one image file to another by simply clicking
to place your cursor anywhere on the image you want to work on. If the
image you want is not visible, choose Window and select the name of the
image from the open image file names displayed at bottom of the menu.
3. Crop each image to the size and shape required for the montage.
The images in this montage will be small, so it’s often best to use only a
portion of the image. To crop an image, follow these steps:
a. Click to select the cropping tool in the Tools palette.
b. Click to place your cursor in your photo, and then drag to draw a
box where you want to make the crop.
c. Use the small squares at the corners of the box to adjust the
cropping area.
d. Double-click in the center of the image to complete the crop.
The area outside the cropping square is removed.
4. Resize the photos.
For each photo, choose Image➪Resize➪Image Size and specify the height
and width you want in the Image Size dialog box. To fit the images in the
montage, you need four images with these sizes:
• The leftmost image should be 175 x 200 pixels
• The two images in the middle area should be 150 x 100 pixels.
• The image on the right should be 275 x 200 pixels.
5. Choose File➪Save As and save the resized image with a new name.
It’s a good idea to save each of your resized and prepared images in case
you need to go back and change anything in your montage image later. If
you use the Save As option and give the edited images new names, you
can keep your original images untouched.
Pasting images into the montage
Next, copy and paste each image into the montage by following these steps:
1. Choose Window, and then choose the file name of the first image you
want to copy into your montage.
2. Copy the image.
a. Click to select the move tool in the Tools palette.
b. Click to place your cursor somewhere in your prepared image,
and then choose Select➪All.
c. Choose Edit➪Copy.
242
Part IV: Creating Special Project Sites 

3. Click to place your cursor in the montage image.
4. Click to select the first layer in the Layers palette (or any other area
you want to replace with your image).
The selected layer turns to a darker grey, indicating that it’s the active
layer.
5. Choose Edit➪Paste.
The photo appears in the montage. When you paste a photo into an exist-
ing image like this, a new layer is automatically created (see Figure 13-5).
You can move the image you pasted by clicking and dragging it within
the montage or by using the arrow keys on your keyboard (a great trick
for making more precise adjustments to placement).
6. Repeat Steps 1 through 6 for each image in the photomontage.
If you want to delete a layer, click to select it, and then drag it to the
trash can at the top of the Layers palette. You can also click and drag to
change the order of layers. This is useful if you want one layer to appear
above another layer, for example a text layer on top of an image layer.
When two or more layers overlap, the layer that is highest in the list in
the Layers palette appears on top.
7. Choose File➪Save For Web.
The Save for Web dialog box opens.
Figure 13-5:

243
Chapter 13: Wish You Were Here: Vacation Sites

8. In the Optimized File Format pull-down, choose JPEG.
9. Set the Quality to 80 percent.
Lowering the quality reduces the file size and makes the image down-
load more quickly.
10. Save the photomontage in your Web site folder and give it a new name.
Customizing the Sample Template Site
You can use the travel site design for any kind of site and, conversely, you can
use any of the templates featured in Part IV to create a travel site. (Although
you may have to make more changes to the template that was intended for the
wedding site before it will serve you well as a travel design, any template can
be edited to fit any topic. You can even combine elements from different tem-
plates to create a new design. For example, you can create a photomontage by
using the predesigned images and instructions from this travel site to create a
montage of newborn photos for the front page of your baby site.)
You can edit template pages as you would any other file. For example, to
format text, you use the standard Microsoft icons on the toolbar at the top of
the FrontPage work area. You find instructions for customizing the travel site
in the exercises that follow, but these instructions assume you have at least
some general knowledge of FrontPage. (For more information on FrontPage 3,
see Chapter 8.)
Opening the template site in FrontPage
FrontPage 3 works best when you use the program’s Open Site feature to
identify your Web site folder before you edit any pages. Make sure you keep
the files for your Web site in one folder; doing so makes it easier to upload
the files to your server later and helps FrontPage set the links properly.
In the following exercises, you’ll be working with the files in the template-
travel-site folder from the Author Files section of the CD. To help you
get started and make it easy for you to build a complete site quickly, I created
four template pages for your travel site:
 index.html is the main page.
 album1.html, album2.html, and album3.html are photo album pages
that are already linked to one another.
After you copy the template-travel-site folder to your hard drive, I sug-
gest you name it something else, such as Hawaii Vacation Site, so you can
identify it more easily. You should also make sure that you’ve copied all your
244
Part IV: Creating Special Project Sites 

edited photos and graphics into the images folder before going through the
steps that follow so that FrontPage can identify all your files during the Open
site process.
Follow these steps to use the FrontPage Open Site command to open the tem-
plate folder for the travel Web site:
1. If you haven’t done so already, insert the CD that accompanies this
book into your computer’s CD drive and copy onto your hard drive
the travel-template-site folder, which is in the Ch13 Travel Site
folder in the Author Files section.
See the warning at the beginning of the chapter if you have trouble
saving these files after you edit them. I’ve named the template folder
template-travel-site, but you may want to begin by renaming the
folder something that has more meaning to you, such as Hawaii Vacation
Site, so you can identify the folder more easily on your hard drive.
2. Open the template site in FrontPage as you would open any other Web
site.
Choose File➪Open Site and locate the Web site folder on your hard drive.
Click to select the folder name, and then click Open. The Web site opens
in FrontPage and the files and subfolders are displayed, as shown in
Figure 13-6. You can open any files into the FrontPage editor by double-
clicking the file name.

Chapter 13: Wish You Were Here: Vacation Sites

Replacing graphics in a template page
After you opened the template site, you can begin to work on the individual
pages of the site. In the exercise that follows, I start by replacing the banner
image in the first page of the template site, but you can use these same steps
to replace any image in the site, such as the photos in the photo album pages. 
To replace an image in any the template pages, follow these steps:
1. With the Web site open in FrontPage (refer to Figure 13-6), double-
click the file name of any page you want to edit.
If you choose index.html, the front page of the travel site template
opens. The main page of any Web site must be named index.html, but
the other pages can be named anything you like, as long as you don’t
use spaces or special characters.
2. Click to select the image on the Web page that you want to replace.
In the example in Figure 13-7, I’m replacing the banner image in the main
page of the site.
3. Press the Delete key on your keyboard to delete the image.
The image disappears from the page. Be careful not to move your cursor
before the next step — you want to insert the new image in the same
place as the old one.

246
Part IV: Creating Special Project Sites 

4. Choose Insert➪Picture➪From File, locate the image you want to use
on your hard drive, and click to select the image.
The new image appears in place of the old one.
5. Repeat Steps 2 through 4 to replace any other images on the page.
6. Choose File➪Save.
Any changes you made to the page are saved.
7. Choose File➪Preview in Browser.
The page is displayed in a Web browser.
To replace images on any other pages, follow the same instructions. For more
information on working with images in FrontPage, see Chapter 8.
Editing text in a template page
In Ken’s travel site, he wrote wonderful descriptions of the fish, sharks, and
other critters he and his friends saw on their scuba diving trip. No matter
what the topic of your travels, your images will have greater meaning if you
include written descriptions.
To add or edit text in any of the template pages, follow these steps:
1. With the Web site open in FrontPage (refer to Figure 13-6), double-
click the name of the file you want to edit.
If you choose album1.html, the first photo album page of the travel site
opens.
2. Highlight any text you want to replace on the page, and type your
own words in its place.
The process is similar to replacing text in any word processing program.
Simply click and drag to select a word or words, use the Delete key to
delete the existing text, and then type to enter your own text. You can
also copy text from another document, such as a Word file, and paste it
into your Web page in FrontPage.
3. Choose File➪Save.
Any changes you made to the page are saved.
4. Choose File➪Preview in Browser.
The page is displayed in a Web browser.
To edit the text on any of the other pages in the site, follow the same instruc-
tions. For more information on editing pages with FrontPage, see Chapter 8.
247
Chapter 13: Wish You Were Here: Vacation Sites

Changing background and text colors
In Ken’s scuba site, he uses a black background, which provides a dramatic set-
ting for his photos. In the sample template site, I chose a lighter background,
using an image I created in Photoshop Elements, so that I could better control
the color and make it match the banner image.
To change the background and text colors in a Web page, follow these steps:
1. With the Web site open in FrontPage (refer to Figure 13-6), double-
click the name of the file you want to edit.
For this example, I opened album1.html, the first photo album page of
the travel site.
2. Right-click anywhere on the page and choose Page Properties.
The Page Properties dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-8.
3. Click the Formatting tab.
4. In the Colors area, choose a background color.
Click the down arrow next to Background and choose any color you like
from the displayed colors in the pull-down list, or choose More Colors to
open the More Colors dialog box, where you can click to select any color
from the color wheel. The color you select fills the color swatch box.
The color does not fill the background of your page until you click OK,
which also closes the dialog box. If you want to alter the text color or
other options, don’t click OK until you’ve made all your changes.
Figure 13-8:
You can
change
background
and text
colors here.
248
Part IV: Creating Special Project Sites 

If you prefer to use a background image, as I did in the template site,
select the Background picture option and use the Browse button to
locate the image you want to use as a background. If you don’t want to
use the background color in the template page, deselect the Background
picture option.
5. In the Text pull-down list, choose a text color.
The process is similar to setting the background color. Choose any color
you like from the displayed colors in the pull-down list, or choose More
Colors to open the More Colors dialog box and click to select any color
from the color wheel. The color you select fills the color swatch box.
6. Click OK.
The Page Properties dialog box closes and any colors you selected are
applied to the page. If you’re not happy with the results or you want to
make further changes, go back to Step 2.
Creating or deleting pages
The template-travel-site folder includes a main page and three photo
album template pages that are already linked to one another with Next and
Previous buttons. (If you want to find out how to add or change links, see
Chapter 8.)
To add new pages, choose the template page that is most like the page you
want to add and then choose File➪Save As to create a copy. Make sure to
give the new page a new name so you don’t overwrite the existing page. After
you save a copy of the page, you can make changes to it in FrontPage without
affecting the original page.
To delete a page, simply click to select the file name of the page in the Web Site
window in FrontPage and press the Delete key on your keyboard. If you remove
a page or section, make sure that you also delete any links to that page.
Publishing Your Web Site
Before you publish your site for all the world to see, make sure you preview
it in a browser and test the links on your hard drive. To preview your page,
choose File➪Preview in Browser.
To publish your Web site, you need access to a Web server, such as those
offered by commercial service providers. (Suggestions for choosing a service
provider are in Chapter 4.) After you set up an account with a service provider,
249
Chapter 13: Wish You Were Here: Vacation Sites

you simply transfer the files you created from your hard drive to your Web
server. You find instructions for using FrontPage to send your site to your
server at the end of Chapter 8.
If you want more instructions for editing pages, see Chapter 8 for a basic
tutorial in using FrontPage. If you want to get into more advanced editing and
design with FrontPage, I recommend FrontPage 2003 For Dummies by Asha
Dornfest (published by Wiley).

 Adding video to your site
 Sending your site to a Web server
S
ome of my favorite family Web sites were created for sports teams and
clubs. I love these sites because they often feature action photos from
sporting events as well as inspiring stories of unexpected victories.
If you’re involved in a sport, club, or hobby, or have a child or other family
member who is and you want to create a Web site to help organize a calendar
of games or special events, explain the intricacies of the new rules, or show
off photos or trophies, this chapter is for you.
In the following pages, you find a sample Web site I created for my friend
Lorion LaRose Edwards. She and I both study karate at United Studios of Self
Defense in Los Angeles. (You can find more about the karate classes they
offer throughout the country at www.ussd.com). Although I use Lorion’s
karate Web site as a model in this chapter, you can create any kind of sports,
hobby, or related Web site by using the templates designed for this chapter.
To make this as easy as possible for you, I’ve included everything you see in
this chapter on the CD, including the full sample karate site, the templates for
the Web pages in the exercises, and the buttons, banners, and other images.
You’ll find these files in the Author Files section of the CD in the Ch14
Sports Site folder.

This chapter walks you through the process of personalizing the pages and
graphics in this site so you can quickly and easily create your own Web site. In
the first section, you tour the sample karate Web site to get a better idea of the
pages you’ll want in your own site. Next, you edit the banner, the buttons, and
other images by using Photoshop Elements 3. Finally, you put it all together in
FrontPage 2003 and add a video file to really bring this site to life. I encourage
you to focus on the sections most important to you and skip any that you
don’t need. For example, if you don’t want to change the text in the buttons,
you can skip that section and use them as they are. Similarly, if you don’t plan
to include video on your site, you don’t need to read the video section at the
end of the chapter.
If you prefer to use Macromedia Dreamweaver MX 2004 to edit these tem-
plates, visit www.digitalfamily.com for instructions.
Identifying the Key Sections of Your Site
Before you get into the details of creating pages and graphics, it’s a good idea
to step back and think about what you want to include on your Web site. To
give you some ideas, this section takes you on a tour of Lorion’s karate site.
Designing the main sections
The first page of your Web site is the most important. As the starting place
for your visitors, the home page should welcome people into the site and
provide easy access to the most relevant information for each visitor. More
252
Part IV: Creating Special Project Sites 
Putting up a Web site the easy way
I’ve designed this chapter to make it as easy as
possible for you to create a Web site for a sport,
club, or hobby with FrontPage and Photoshop
Elements. But even with the templates and
graphics on the CD, you still have a multistep
process to go through before your Web site can
be published. If creating your own pages in
FrontPage and setting up your own account
with a service provider are more than you want
to do, try a simpler alternative.
The fastest and easiest way I’ve found to create
a Web site like this is to use an online service,
such as the one at family.myevent.com.
You won’t have as much design control with a
service such as MyEvent, and they charge more
than a Web hosting provider, but they do make
it as easy as possible for you to get your site
online quickly.

than anything, you want to give visitors lots of options and enough introduc-
tory information to help them make informed choices when they click a link
to another page in the site.
In the front page of the sample karate site, shown in Figure 14-1, the naviga-
tion buttons on the left provide easy access to the main sections of the site.
The introductory text on the right explains that this site is about Lorion’s
karate class and that visitors will find photos, a calendar, and even a video by
following the links on the left. The challenge in writing text for the main page
of a Web site is to keep it brief but still provide a good overview. If you put
too much information on the front page, you risk creating confusion or over-
whelming your visitors. But if you don’t include enough information, your 
visitors may get lost or miss some of the best parts of your site.
At the top of the page, note the banner graphic. Most good Web sites include
some kind of main heading like this to quickly identify what the Web site is
about. In the sample site, the banner states, Welcome to my karate Web site.
The template site has a more generic banner that states Welcome to my Web
site, but you can personalize the banner later. (You find instructions for chang-
ing the text on the banner and other graphics in the “Customizing Your Web
Site Graphics” section.)

253
Chapter 14: In Your Spare Time: Creating Club, Sports, and Hobby Sites

Defining the subsections
For each subsection of your Web site, you may want to create a different
banner. For example, the front page banner might say Welcome to my Karate
Web Site, and the front page of the photo section might say Karate Photo Album.
To keep things simple in the sample site, I used the same banner at the top of
all the sections, and added a heading below the banner with the name of the
section, such as the Photo Album heading you see in Figure 14-2. Whatever
you choose, it’s a good idea to use the same option throughout your site
because it’s easier for visitors to find their way around when navigation
options and page headers are consistent.
Customizing Your Web Site Graphics
Before you start building your Web pages in FrontPage, I suggest that you
prepare the graphics in Photoshop Elements because it’s easier to put your
site together when you have all the pieces ready. I’ve broken the graphics
section of the chapter into four parts, based on each type of image in the site:
the banner, the buttons, the headings, and the photo frames. In the exercise
that follows, you find instructions for customizing the banner graphic.

Part IV: Creating Special Project Sites 

Before you get started, insert the CD that came with this book into your com-
puter’s CD drive and copy the Ch14 Sports Site folder from the Author
Files section of the CD onto your hard drive. To help you design your site,
I’ve included three folders in the Ch14 Sports Site folder:
 photoshop-files has the graphics in a format that makes them easy
to edit. These are the images you should use for the exercise in the next
few sections.
 sample-karate-site features the site shown in Figures 14-1 and 14-2.
 template-sports-site has the template pages and graphics you
should use as the basis of your site.
When you copy images from a CD to your hard drive, you may find that the
files are locked, so you can’t save changes to them. To correct this on a PC,
right-click the Ch14 Sports Site folder and choose Properties. In the
Attributes area of the Properties dialog box, uncheck the Read Only option.
Click Apply and then click OK. If you’re using a Mac, Ô-click the folder name,
choose Get Info, and uncheck the Locked option.
Editing the banner graphic
At the top of the main page of the sample karate Web site, I created a graphic
that features images symbolizing karate. I designed this banner image to
make it easy for you to replace each part with your own content. Take a look
at the banner at the top of the page in Figure 14-2 and think about changes
that you want to make to your banner graphic. You can replace the text, add
your own logo or team emblem on the left, and insert an image on the right.
To edit the banner graphic, follow these steps.
1. Launch Photoshop Elements (or any image design program that sup-
ports layers).
2. Open the banner.psd graphic, which is in the photoshop-files folder.
Choose File➪Open and locate the file on your hard drive.
3. If the Layers palette is not already open, choose Window➪Layers.
The Layers palette opens on the right side of the screen, as shown in
Figure 14-3. This graphic has the following layers: Welcome, Text, Logo,
Graphic, and Background. Before you can change any part of this graphic,
you must first select the layer that corresponds to it.
4. To change the words To my Web site, which are on the Text layer, do
the following:
a. In the Layers palette, click to select the Text layer.
The Text layer becomes shaded in a darker grey indicating that it’s
the active layer.
255
Chapter 14: In Your Spare Time: Creating Club, Sports, and Hobby Sites

b. Click to select the text tool in the Tools palette.
If the Tools palette is not open, choose Window➪Tools to open it.
c. Click to highlight the words To my Web site and then type to
replace the words with the text you want in your banner.
In the sample site, I simply added the word karate, so the text
reads Welcome to my karate Web site.
d. Use the text formatting options at the top of the work area to
change the font face, color, and size.
In the sample site, I used 16-point, bold, italic Myriad Pro for the
words To my Web site. You can use any font you want; just click
and drag to select the text before you change the text formatting
options. If you change the font, however, I recommend that you
also change the font in the other graphics on this site so that they
all look the same. For more information on editing text in graphics
and adjusting font options, see Chapter 6.
5. If you want to change the word Welcome, click to select the Welcome
layer, click and drag to select the word Welcome, and repeat Steps 4b
through 4d.
I used 30-point bold, italic Myriad Pro for the word Welcome.

256
Part IV: Creating Special Project Sites 

Now that you’ve replaced the text, it’s time to turn your attention to the logo.
I used a generic graphic in this banner (a series of colored circles instead of
the Chinese text you see in the karate sample site). You should replace this
graphic with your own logo or another image that better represents the topic
of your Web site. Continuing where you just left off, follow these steps:
1. Open the image file that you want to add to the banner.
Choose File➪Open, locate the image file on your hard drive, and double-
click to open it.
2. Resize the image.
Choose Image➪Resize and specify the height and width in the Image Size
dialog box. If you want to integrate your logo into the existing banner
design, make it approximately the same size as the circle in the sample
image, about 1 inch, or 72 pixels, square.
3. Copy and paste the logo into the banner image.
a. Click to select the move tool in the Tools palette.
b. Click to place your cursor somewhere in your logo image, and
then choose Select➪All.
c. Choose Edit➪Copy.
d. Click to place your cursor on the left side of the banner image.
e. Click to select the Logo layer in the Layers palette.
The Logo layer turns to a darker grey, indicating that it’s the active
layer.
f. Choose Edit➪Paste.
The new graphic appears in the banner and a new layer is created.
You can adjust the position of the graphic by clicking and dragging
it within the banner image or by using the arrow keys on your key-
board. For more information about resizing an image or using copy
and paste to copy an image from one file to another, see Chapter 6.
4. Delete the original Logo layer.
To do so, click to select the original Logo layer and then drag it to the
small trash can icon at the top of the Layer palette.
5. Add your own image to the right side of the banner.
If you don’t have an image you want to insert in the right side of the
banner, you can simply leave it blank and skip ahead to Step 6.
The blue rectangle in the sample image is there to make it easy for you
to replace it with your own image, as follows:
a. Delete the Graphic layer by selecting it and dragging it to the
small trash can icon at the top of the Layers palette.
257
Chapter 14: In Your Spare Time: Creating Club, Sports, and Hobby Sites

b. Choose File➪Open, locate on your hard drive the image file you
want to use, and double-click to open it.
c. Resize or crop the image.
Because this is a long, narrow, small area, you may want to crop a
small part of a graphic or photo, as I did with the banner for the
karate site shown in Figure 14-1. To fit your image in the area of the
blue image, resize or crop it to about 250 by 65 pixels. For more
information on cropping or resizing, see Chapter 6.
6. Choose File➪Save For Web.
The Save for Web dialog box opens.
7. In the Optimized File Format pull-down, choose GIF, as shown in
Figure 14-4.
8. Set the number in the Colors box to 64.
Limiting the number of colors reduces the file size and makes the image
download more quickly. For an even smaller file size, reduce this number
further, but don’t go too far or you’ll adversely affect the appearance of
the image. For more information on Web graphics options, see Chapter 6.
9. Save the new banner in your Web site folder and give it a new name.

Your new, customized banner is now ready to be inserted into your Web pages.
You find instructions for doing so later in this chapter in the “Customizing the
Template Site” section.
Editing the button graphics
The buttons in the sample Web site are labeled Calendar, Photo Album,
Activities, Favorites, and Video Section. All five predesigned buttons are in
the images folder in the template-sports-site folder, and are already
linked to their respective pages. You can use these buttons just as they are
in your site, or you can edit them to change the text, image, and links. If you
don’t want to use one of the predesigned buttons in the template site, simply
delete it (just make sure you delete it from every page where it appears).
In the following exercise, you find instructions for editing the button.psd file
included in the photoshop-files folder in the Ch14 Sports Site folder.
This image was created with layers, to make it easy to change any one ele-
ment without affecting the others. For example, you can replace the text but
keep the blue circle if you don’t have a logo you want to use in its place.
I’ve included a .psd file for each button, labeled button-calendar.psd,
button-activities.psd, and so on. You can edit any of these buttons or
you can use the generic button.psd file to create a new button, as you do
in the following exercise.
When you add text to buttons and headings, the trick is to be concise. The
fewer and the shorter the words, the better. For example, don’t try to provide
a long explanation like My favorite Web sites in a button. Instead, limit your-
self to the most important word, Favorites.
To edit any button graphic in the photoshop-files folder or to create a new
one based on the button.psd file, follow these steps.
1. Launch Photoshop Elements.
2. In the photoshop-files folder, open the button graphic that you
want to edit.
Choose File➪Open and locate the file on your hard drive. To create a
new button, I suggest you use button.psd.
3. If the Layers palette is not already open, choose Window➪Layers.
The Layers palette opens on the right side of the screen. The button.psd
file has three layers: Text, Logo, and Background. Before you can change
any part of this graphic, you must first select the layer that corresponds
to it.
259
Chapter 14: In Your Spare Time: Creating Club, Sports, and Hobby Sites

4. In the Layers palette, click to select the Text layer.
The Text layer becomes shaded in a darker grey, indicating that it’s the
active layer.
5. Click to select the text tool in the Tools palette.
If the Tools palette is not open, choose Window➪Tools to open it.
6. Click to highlight the words on the button, and then type to replace
the words with the text you want to use.
In the button.psd file, you want to replace the words, Your Text Here.
If you have trouble changing the text, you can delete the Text layer by
dragging it to the small trash icon at the top of the page, click to select
the Text tool from the toolbox, insert your cursor on the button, and
type new text.
7. Use the text formatting options at the top of the work area to change
the font face, color, and font size.
Remember, you have to click and drag to select the text before you can
change the formatting options. In the buttons for this template, I used
12-point, bold Myriad Pro. If you don’t have Myriad Pro or you prefer to
change it, you can use any font you want. If you change the font, how-
ever, I recommend that you also change the font in the other graphics in
this site so that they all look the same.
8. To replace the logo on the button, first open the image file that you
want to add to the button.
Choose File➪Open, locate the image file on your hard drive, and double-
click to open the file.
You can enlarge the display of an image to make it easier to work on the
details. To do so, click the zoom tool (which looks like a magnifying
glass) from the Tools palette and then click the image where you want to
enlarge it. To reduce the image display size, press Alt+Click (on a PC) or
Ô+Click (on a Mac). To return the image to its actual size, double-click
the zoom tool.
9. Resize the image.
Choose Image➪Resize and specify the height and width in the Image Size
dialog box. If you want to integrate the image into the existing button
design, make it approximately the same size as the circles in the sample
image, about 20 pixels square.
10. Copy and paste the image.
a. Click to select the move tool in the Tools palette.
b. Click to place your cursor somewhere in your logo image, and
then choose Select➪All.
c. Choose Edit➪Copy.
260
Part IV: Creating Special Project Sites 

d. Click to place your cursor on the left side of the button image.
e. Click to select the Logo layer in the Layers palette.
The Logo layer turns to a darker grey, indicating it’s the active layer.
f. Choose Edit➪Paste.
The new graphic appears in the button and a new layer is created.
You can adjust the position of the graphic by clicking and drag-
ging it within the button image or by using the arrow keys on your
keyboard.
11. Delete the original Logo layer.
To do so, click to select the original Logo layer and drag it to the small
trash can at the top of the Layer palette.
12. Choose File➪Save For Web.
The Save For Web dialog box opens.
13. In the Optimized File Format pull-down, choose GIF.
14. Set the number in the Colors box to 32, as shown in Figure 14-5.
Limiting the number of colors reduces the file size and makes the image
download more quickly, but if you reduce the number too far, you risk
degrading the image quality. (For more information on optimizing
images for the Web, see Chapter 6.)
Figure 14-5:
This dialog
box makes
it easy to

261
Chapter 14: In Your Spare Time: Creating Club, Sports, and Hobby Sites

15. Save the new button in your Web site folder and give it a new name.
In the example in Figure 14-5, I created a button with the words My
Awards but I didn’t change the logo image, so the image retains the
generic round circle you’ll find in the button.psd file.
Repeat these steps for each button you want to create or change. The next
task is to edit the heading graphics for your Web site.
Editing the heading graphics
The heading graphics are the easiest to edit because they have only two layers,
one for the background and one for the words, as you see in Figure 14-6. To
edit a heading graphic, open it and follow Steps 1 through 7 in the preceding
exercise. The file names for the heading graphics are the same as the button
labels — Calendar, Photo Album, Activities, Favorites, and Video Section —
preceded by the word heading (for example, heading-activities.psd). I’ve
also included a generic heading.psd file that you can use to create new head-
ing graphics.
It’s a good idea to use the same words for heading graphics and their corre-
sponding navigation buttons. That way, it’s easier for visitors to find their
away around the pages of your Web site.
Figure 14-6:
The heading

Part IV: Creating Special Project Sites 

Preparing the photos for your Web site
Before you add photos to your Web site, you should optimize them so that
they will download as quickly as possible. If you’re not sure what I mean by
optimizing an image, read Chapter 6.
The following steps walk you through the process of resizing and optimizing
a photo and inserting it in the photo frame used in the template:
1. Launch Photoshop Elements.
2. Open the picture-frame-tall.psd graphic in the photoshop-files
folder.
Choose File➪Open and locate the file on your hard drive. You can open
it from the CD if you prefer.
I created two photo frames, one for a tall image and one for a wide image.
On the front page, the design calls for a tall image, but in the photo album
pages you can use both tall and wide images.
3. If the Layers palette is not already open, choose Window➪Layers.
The Layers palette opens on the right side of the screen. This graphic has
three layers, called Text, Photo, and Background. Before you can change
any part of this graphic, you must first select the layer that corresponds
to it.
4. In the Layers palette, click to select the Photo layer.
The Photo layer becomes shaded in a darker grey, indicating that it’s the
active layer.
5. Open the file containing the photograph you want to use on your
Web site.
Choose File➪Open, locate a photo on your hard drive, and double-click
to open it. If you’re using the tall photo frame, you need to use a verti-
cally oriented photo or crop a wide photo into a vertical shape.
6. Resize the photo you want to insert into the photo frame.
Choose Image➪Resize and specify the height and width you want in the
Image Size dialog box, as shown in Figure 14-7. Wide photos should be
no larger than 315 by 210 pixels, and tall photos should be no larger than
180 by 275 pixels.
7. Copy the photo and paste your photo into the picture frame image as
follows:
a. Click to select the move tool in the Tools palette.
b. Click to place your cursor anywhere in your photo file, and then
choose Select➪All.
c. Choose Edit➪Copy.
263
Chapter 14: In Your Spare Time: Creating Club, Sports, and Hobby Sites

d. Click to place your cursor in the middle of the picture frame
image, and then choose Edit➪Paste.
Your photo appears in the picture frame and a new layer is cre-
ated. You can adjust the position of your photo by clicking and
dragging it within the picture frame image or by using the arrow
keys on your keyboard.
e. Delete the original Photo layer.
To do so, click to select the original Photo layer (the blue box) and
drag it to the small trash can icon at the top of the Layers palette.
f. Delete the Text layer.
8. Choose File➪Save For Web.
The Save For Web dialog box opens.
9. In the Optimized File Format pull-down, choose JPEG.
10. Set the Quality to 80 percent.
Lowering the quality helps reduce the file size and make the image
download more quickly. For more information on optimizing graphics
for the Web, see Chapter 6.
11. Save the new photo in your Web site folder with a new name.

264
Part IV: Creating Special Project Sites 

Repeat these steps for each photo you want to prepare for your site. Then
follow the steps in the next section to insert these images into your pages.
Customizing the Template Site
I’ve created the templates for this chapter with a sports, hobby, or club site
in mind. If you don’t plan to edit any of the graphics on the Web site, you can
jump right in and start building your pages by following the steps in this sec-
tion. If you want to edit the banner, buttons, or other graphics, I suggest you
work on the images first so that you have all the pieces of your site ready
before you begin working on the page designs.
I include a template for each of the sections of the site, but you can use the
same template for all the pages. In the exercises in this section, I start with
the first page of the site because it’s the starting point for everything else and
the most complicated page to create.
Opening the template site in FrontPage
You can edit template pages as you would edit any other file in FrontPage. For
example, to add text, you simply place your cursor on the page where you
want the text to appear and type. FrontPage is a relatively easy Web design pro-
gram, especially if you already use a program like Microsoft Word. For example,
FrontPage has the same standard Microsoft icons on the toolbar for aligning
and formatting text.
FrontPage works best when you use the program’s Open Site feature to identify
your Web site folder before you edit any pages. You should also keep all the
files for your Web site in one folder — doing so makes it easier to upload the
files to your server later and helps FrontPage set the links properly. You’ll be
working with the files in the template-sports-site folder, but I suggest you
begin by renaming that folder something else, such as My Karate Site, so you
can identify it more easily on your hard drive.
Follow these steps to use the FrontPage Open Site command to open the tem-
plate folder for the sports Web site:
1. If you haven’t done so already, insert the CD that came with this book
into your computer’s CD drive and copy the template sports-site
folder from the Ch14 Sports Site folder onto your hard drive.
2. Open the template site in FrontPage as you’d open any other Web site.
Choose File➪Open Site, locate the Web site folder on your hard drive, click
to select the folder, and then click Open. The Web site opens in FrontPage
and the files and subfolders are displayed, as shown in Figure 14-8.
265
Chapter 14: In Your Spare Time: Creating Club, Sports, and Hobby Sites

Editing text in a template page
After you open the template site, you can begin to work on the individual pages
of the site. To edit the text in any of the template pages, follow these steps:
1. With the Web site open in FrontPage (refer to Figure 14-8), double-
click the name of the file you want to edit.
If you choose index.html, the front page of the sports site template
opens. The main page of any Web site must be named index.html, but
the other pages can be named anything you like. I named the files in
this site with the same names as the buttons and heading graphics to
make it easy for you to identify them. For example, the activities page
is called activities.html. In the example (see Figure 14-9), I opened
album3.html.
2. Highlight any text you want to replace on the page and type your own
words.
Simply click and drag to select a word or words, press the Delete key to
delete the existing text, and then type to enter your own text. You can
also use the copy and paste function to copy text from another docu-
ment, such as a Word file, into your Web page in FrontPage.

When you
open a Web
site folder in
FrontPage,
the files and
subfolders

visible in the
workspace
area.
266
Part IV: Creating Special Project Sites 

3. Choose File➪Save.
Any changes you made to the page are saved.
4. Choose File➪Preview in Browser.
The page is displayed in a Web browser.
To edit the text on any of the other pages in the site, follow the same instruc-
tions. For more information on editing pages with FrontPage, see Chapter 8,
which covers many basic page editing features.
Replacing images in a template page
The following instructions show you how to replace or add an image to a page.
Before you do, however, make sure all your image files are in the images folder
in the main Web site folder so that the links will be set properly.
To replace the images in any of the template pages, follow these steps:
1. With the Web site open in FrontPage (refer to Figure 14-8), double-
click the name of the file you want to edit.
The page opens in the FrontPage workspace.
Figure 14-9:

and edit text

you would in
Microsoft
Word.
267
Chapter 14: In Your Spare Time: Creating Club, Sports, and Hobby Sites

2. Click to select the image you want to replace.
In the example in Figure 14-10, I’m replacing the banner image, which
is called banner.gif, in the main page of the site, which is called
index.html.
3. Press the Delete key on your keyboard to delete the image.
The image disappears from the page. Be careful not to move your cursor
or to delete more than the image, because you want to insert the new
image in the same place as the old one.
4. Choose Insert➪Picture➪From File, and locate and select the image
you want to use on your hard drive, as shown in Figure 14-10.
The new image appears in place of the old one.
5. Repeat Steps 2 through 4 to replace any other images on the page.
6. Click File➪Save.
Any changes you made to the page are saved.
7. Choose File➪Preview in Browser.
The page is displayed in a Web browser.
To replace images in any other pages in the site, follow the same instructions.
For more information on working with images in FrontPage, see Chapter 8.
Creating or deleting pages
The sports-template folder includes a template page for each of the main
pages in the sample site. You can add pages or remove pages to further cus-
tomize the site to your own liking.
Figure 14-10:
To cus-
tomize the
template,
replace the
generic
graphics
with your
images.
268
Part IV: Creating Special Project Sites 

To add pages, choose the template page that is most like the page you want
to add and choose File➪Save As to create a copy. Give the new page a new
name so you don’t overwrite the existing page. After you save a copy of
the page, you can make changes to it in FrontPage without affecting the 
original page.
If you remove a page or a section, make sure that you also delete the naviga-
tion buttons that link to that page. To do that, you need to open each page
in the site, click to select the button that links to that page, and delete the
graphic that represents the button. When you delete the button, you auto-
matically remove the link.
One of the best ways to develop a Web site is to experiment. Don’t be afraid
to add more text and images to the pages or to add new sections. If you need
more instruction than I’ve provided in this chapter, see Chapter 8 for a basic
tutorial in using FrontPage. If you want to get into more advanced editing and
design with FrontPage, I recommend FrontPage 2003 For Dummies by Asha
Dornfest (published by Wiley).
If you want to add an interactive calendar to your site to keep track of games,
meetings, and other events, check out Yahoo! Calendar (yahoo.calendar.
com), one of the most widely used calendar programs. This free service is
powerful and adaptable. You can choose from a gallery of images so that
each month (or week or whatever) will have a different picture. You can even
specify who to share your calendar with — which is useful if you’re trying to
keep track of dance recitals or soccer practices and you want multiple people
to have access to the dates. Yahoo! also has a handy feature that enables you
to sync their online calendar with a Palm or Outlook program. You can also
choose which holidays you want to have listed, and even set reminders for
special dates.
Editing the Video Pages
Sports and club sites are especially well served by adding video files because
you have so much great motion to show off. Only video can capture the swing
of a bat, the twirl of a skirt in a dance class, the laughter and play in a club-
house, or the blocks and kicks featured in the video in the sample karate site.
If you don’t want to add video to your site, I suggest you simply delete the
video.html page and the Video Section button on each of the remaining
pages. If you do want to add video, read on.
In case you don’t have a video file and want to follow this exercise to see how
it works, I included on the CD a video file used in the sample karate site. This
.wmv file is in the multimedia folder of the sample-karate-site folder,
which is in the Ch14 Sports Site folder.
269
Chapter 14: In Your Spare Time: Creating Club, Sports, and Hobby Sites

Adding a video file to your Web page is similar to adding an image file. To use
FrontPage to insert a video file, follow these steps:
1. Make sure the video file you want to insert is saved in the main folder
of your Web site.
I suggest you create a multimedia folder inside your main Web site
folder so you can keep your video files separate from the other files in
your site. This helps with the organization of your site and makes it easy
to find the video if you want to edit or remove it later.
2. Open the Web page in FrontPage, and click to insert the cursor where
you want the file to be displayed on the page.
Make sure you’re in Design view in FrontPage by clicking the Design icon
at the bottom left of the page.
3. Choose Insert➪Picture➪Video.
Note that Video is the last option at the bottom of the list, and you may
need to use the expansion arrow to make it visible. The Select Video
dialog box appears.
4. Browse your drive to locate the video file you want to insert, and click
to select it.
In the example for this exercise, I selected the karate-demo.wmv file.
5. Click Open.
The dialog box closes, the video file is inserted on the page, and the first
frame of the video appears on the page.
6. Double-click the video image to open the Picture Properties dialog box.
You can set many options in the Picture Properties dialog box, as shown
in Figure 14-11.
7. Click the Appearance tab and specify alignment, spacing, and size
options.
Alignment works much like it does with images. If you align the video
to the left or right, you can wrap text around it. The settings in the Size
area are inserted automatically, but you may want to change this setting
to display the video in a smaller area, which can improve the quality and
help the video fit better on smaller monitors. You find detailed descrip-
tions of Picture Properties options in Chapter 10.
8. If you want to create a link from the video file to any other Web page,
video, or other file, click the General tab.
Most of the options in the General tab don’t apply to video. (FrontPage
uses this same dialog box for a variety of file types.) However, at the
bottom is the Link box, where you can set your video to link to another
page or Web site. Just enter the URL of the site you want to link to or use
the Browse button to locate a page within your Web site.
270
Part IV: Creating Special Project Sites 

9. Click the Video tab and specify loop, loop delay, and start options.
If you choose to not loop your video, it will play once and stop. If you
want your video file to play over and over, set the number of times you
want it to repeat in the Loop box. The Loop Delay option will cause the
video to pause for the specified time before it repeats.
10. Click OK.
The Picture Properties dialog box closes.
11. To play the video, click the Preview button at the bottom of the
FrontPage work area.
FrontPage doesn’t display video files in Design view, so you have to
switch to Preview. If you prefer to view the page in a browser, choose
File➪Preview in Browser. You’ll see the video as it will appear when
viewed with a browser on the Web.
Publishing Your Web Site
Congratulations, you made it to the end of the chapter. You should be well on
your way to completing your club, hobby, or sports Web site. Your final step
is to publish your site to a Web server to make it accessible to other people
on the Internet.
Figure 14-11:

271
Chapter 14: In Your Spare Time: Creating Club, Sports, and Hobby Sites

Most family sites are hosted by commercial service providers. (You can find
suggestions for choosing a service provider in Chapter 4.) After you set up an
account with a service provider, you simply transfer the files from your hard
drive to the Web server. To use FrontPage to send your site to the server, see
Chapter 8.
Even after you’ve published your Web site to a server, you’re not really fin-
ished. All good Web sites grow, and you can always add more pages and
graphics to your site in the future. Updating seems to work best when you
develop a regular schedule. For example, you could add new photos every
Sunday or update team stats the day after each game. This works well for
your visitors, too, because they know what to expect and when to return to
the site to see updates.
If you want more instructions for editing and updating your pages, see
Chapter 8, which provides a basic FrontPage tutorial. If you want to get into
advanced editing and design with FrontPage, I recommend FrontPage 2003 For
Dummies by Asha Dornfest (published by Wiley).

B
logs are increasingly in the news. You may have heard about blogs on
the radio or read about them in a newspaper or magazine, but if these
strangely named Web sites are new to you, don’t worry, this chapter is
designed to help you appreciate this dynamic part of the Internet.
Blogs, or Web logs, are online journals that are updated frequently, some-
times even daily. An update, (also called an entry or a post) is usually quite
short, perhaps just a few sentences, and readers can often respond to an
entry online. People who write blogs are commonly called bloggers. Bloggers,
tongue in cheek, call themselves and their blogs the blogosphere.
Many early blogs focused on technology, news, and politics, but that has
changed dramatically in the last few years. Today, blogs are written by people
who are chronicling their lives, keeping track of a particular interest, or just
writing for themselves. Increasingly, mothers, fathers, teenagers, even entire
families are writing blogs. Their informal, engaging style and interactive format
make them attractive for families looking to continue conversations they begin
in e-mail messages, letters, or phone calls. For families spread across the state,
country, or globe, a blogcan be an instant “family fix” when time differences
make a phone call impossible.
Blogs are a great way to keep everyone in a family abreast of the latest family
news without running up the phone bill — you can simply read back over
important updates to find out the latest news. In addition, many blogs are
being used to host photographs, and their chronological structure can be a

great way to keep track of a baby’s growth, a trip, or the process of planning
a wedding.
But what makes a blog different from any other family Web site? A blog is
designed around a particular form of publishing: frequent, short updates,
often using links and accompanied by a corresponding set of comments from
readers. Blogs are meant to be written and read regularly — even daily. Their
tone is usually informal, almost stream of consciousness. Although the writ-
ing may be free form, a blog has some common organizational structures that
make understanding and participating in the conversation easy for readers.
Reading a Typical Blog
Most people name their blogs and display the name prominently at the top of
the page. Some names are simple and descriptive, such as the blog shown in
Figure 15-1 called Suman Kumar’s Wedding Blog. Others are clever twists of a
phrase, or personal, funny word combinations.
Below the name, you usually find the most recent update or blog entry. The
date and sometimes the time are displayed so that you can tell when the last
entry was created. Previous entries appear in reverse chronological order
down the page. Blogs are often long pages that scroll on and on with a series
of dated entries and invitations to readers to comment. (You find more about
comments in the “Invite comments” section, later in this chapter).
On the right or left side of the browser window, a blog often includes a collec-
tion of links and related resources, such as an invitation to subscribe to an
e-mail list, explanatory or biographical information, links to archived entries,
or links to recommended Web sites.

How Families Are Using Blogs
Families are making use of blogs to share a wide range of information with
family and friends. The examples in this section will provide you with ideas
for how you might use this technology to create your own online journal.
Communicating with friends and family
At heart, a blog is a communication tool. Whatever else it does, a blog is first
and foremost about establishing dialogue. With a family blog, the dialogue is
usually with family members and friends near and far.
Busymom.net, shown in Figure 15-2, is a good example of a blog that keeps
friends and family up-to-date on all the family news, from first days at school
to the different grocery shopping strategies of Busy Mom and Busy Dad. Busy
Mom’s blog, at Busymom.net, goes back to April 2003. She posts frequently,
usually multiple times a day. On August 24, 2004, for example, she wrote
three entries. The longest was only 63 words.
Busy Mom’s audience is very vocal, often posting a dozen or so comments on
each entry (see Figure 15-3). In response to an entry about trying to plan a
week’s worth of meals, for example, her audience responded with favorite
recipes, shopping strategies, and sympathetic anecdotes.
Readers of Busymom.net can keep track of big and little events in Busy Mom’s
life. Sometimes that means a lot of posts about errands that need running and
back-to-school shopping, but sometimes things take a serious turn. In June

Chapter 15: The Family Blog: Sharing Stories with an Online Journal
To blog or not to blog
Most of the blogs in this chapter are focused on
a specific topic, such as a new baby, a wedding,
or the life of a busy mom. Blogs can be created
as stand-alone Web sites or you can choose to
create a blog as a part of a bigger Web site. For
the most part, you have more options and
greater design control if you create a site your-
self in a program such as FrontPage (covered in
Chapters 8 and 9) than if you use one of the
blogging software programs featured at the end
of this chapter. If your main goal is to update
your site regularly with written text, a blog may
be your best and simplest choice. If you’re more
interested in sharing lots of photos, video, and
other information and you want to be able to
create a more complex design or use the tem-
plates included with this book, you’re better off
using one of the design options covered in
Chapters 11 to 14. If you really want both, con-
sider creating your own custom site and then
linking to a blog.

2003, Busy Mom’s mom was diagnosed with lung cancer, and many of her blog
posts talked about her mom’s treatments and experiences, as well as Busy
Mom’s sadness about her mom’s illness.

Many a blog is devoted to chronicling wedding planning and the ceremony
itself. Blogs make the complicated organization and endless details involved
in wedding planning a little easier, because the bride and groom can post
information to the blog instead of making phone call after phone call. Some
wedding blogs are also used to advise guests on accommodations and wed-
ding activities.
One of the best wedding blogs I’ve seen was created by Jonathan and Joanne,
who created wedding.studio2f.com for their wedding in the U.S. Virgin
Islands. Their Web site, shown in Figure 15-4, keeps guests apprised of the
arrangements they’re making for the ceremony and reception, such as hotel
accommodations, ferry schedules, and a trip to a nearby island.
The site also includes links to Jonathan and Joanne’s gift registries, a count-
down to the wedding day, and current weather information for St. John.
Although there are many ways to design a wedding Web site (see Chapter 13
for alternatives), many people use blogging software because it’s quick and
easy to set up and requires little technical experience. (You find more about
blogging software later in this chapter.)

Babbling about babies
Everyone loves a new baby, and grandparents who don’t live nearby can
never get enough information and pictures. A baby blog makes it easy to
share the trials and tribulations of a new baby’s life with friends and family.
A variety of software programs and technologies are available for designing
baby sites and blogs. Use any of the blogging software programs featured at
the end of this chapter, and see Chapter 11 for some other alternatives for
creating a baby Web site.
One of the most impressive baby blogs on the Internet is The Trixie Update,
at www.trixieupdate.com/, which chronicles the life and times of Beatrix
MacNeill, born July 31, 2003. The site is astonishing in its detail, seemingly cov-
ering every moment of Trixie’s daily routine. When you arrive, you find out
whether Trixie is awake or asleep, find out about her daily actives, and can
even keep track of changes in the Diaper Log (2,611 as of 7:45 p.m. August 26,
2004). The Trixie Update is maintained by her dad, Ben. He started the blog
because Trixie’s mom, Jennifer, had to go back to work and wanted to stay con-
nected during the day.
An important component of The Trixie Update is the TPOD (Trixie Picture of
the Day), as shown in Figure 15-5. You can follow Trixie’s growth from day one
by tracking back through more than a year of photos. The Trixie Update also
has postings sorted into categories such as Behavior, Day-to-Day Minutiae,
Inner Workings, Milestones, and Site News.
New stories are added to Trixie Update every couple of weeks or so and the
site’s comments often include advice and commiserations from other parents,
as well as responses from a growing list of people who have become fans of
Trixie and her well-reported activities.

The data-tracking features of The Trixie Update (numbers of diaper changes,
feedings, naps, and so on) have been spun off into software called Trixie
Tracker, a subscription-based program built by Trixie’s father Ben, who sells
it in three-month subscriptions for $10. You can visit www.trixietracker.

Traipsing the travel logs
When family members travel, individually or together, an extended group of
people usually want to know all about the trip. If you’re a college student
preparing for a semester abroad, a young couple going around the world, or
a family taking an unusual vacation, consider starting a blog so your friends
and family can track your progress. It’s cheaper than postcards and your
messages are sure to get home before you do!
The Fleming family, Sarah and Ray and their two young daughters, left home,
career, and school behind in the U.K. to pursue a trip around the world in
July 2003. The Flemings decided to chronicle their trip with a blog, as shown
in Figure 15-6. To produce their travel site, called The Fleming Family Travel
Tales, they brought along a computer, two digital cameras, and a digital video
camera.
Visit the site at www.rfleming.net to read about their stops in places like
Canada, the United States, Fiji, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia,
Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, and France.

Writing a Good Blog
Professional writers often look down on bloggers, because their informal
online writing rarely benefits from a good editor. Blogs are known for their
casual writing and unpredictable subject material, but the best blogs have
proven that — regardless of punctuation and spelling — even “novice” writ-
ers can be entertaining enough to attract a broad audience.
Bloggers with an especially engaging subject, such as chronicling a trip around
the world, have the advantage of inherently interesting material, but even mun-
dane material can attract an audience if you have an engaging style and voice.
Here are three guiding principles to writing a successful blog:
 Develop a writing style and tone appropriate to your subject material.
 Post often, even if your posts are short.
 Allow your readers to comment on your posts.
Develop a writing style and voice
A great site design and technical gimmicks are no replacement for developing
an interesting, readable writing style. Most of us don’t do much personal writ-
ing in our everyday lives or even keep a diary. Writing about yourself is never
easy, and you may find yourself freezing up in front of the computer screen or
becoming stilted and unnecessarily verbose.
A number of great books about writing are available in your local bookstore,
and they may be good resources if you’re having trouble and are determined
to improve. Some of my favorite books on writing include the following:
 Woe Is I: The Grammarphobe’s Guide to Better English in Plain English,
2nd Edition, by Patricia O’Connor (Riverhead Books): An unexpectedly
entertaining and cleverly written book on grammar that will help you
correct some of the most common mistakes in English.
 Bird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life, by Anne Lamott
(Anchor Publishing): In her humorous and self-deprecating style, Lamott
shares her secrets for staying sane as a single mom while struggling to
become a successful writer. Lamott’s other best-selling books include
Traveling Mercies and Operation Instructions, based on the first year of
her son’s life.
 On Writing, by Stephen King (Pocket Books): With an honest account of
the many rejection letters and other setbacks he suffered in his early
days as a writer, King shares his best advice for other aspiring authors.
280
Part IV: Creating Special Project Sites 

 On Writing Well, by William Zinsser (Harper Resource): Celebrating its
25th anniversary, this book is a classic guide on writing clearly and 
concisely.
Here are a few suggestions you can use to develop your own voice and style
for your blog. First, remember that a blog is a conversation. Try to write the
way you speak. Avoid jargon and clichés and don’t overuse the thesaurus. It
may be helpful to speak your entry out loud before trying to type it or to read
it aloud after you’ve written it. If you find yourself struggling as you read aloud
or speaking unnaturally, think about what you might have said if you were
talking to a friend rather than writing.
Second, write your blog with a specific friend or family member in mind.
Thinking of someone you know well and who might want to read your blog
will help you relax your writing style. That’s why it’s become popular for
many people to start personal journal entries with Dear Diary. The goal is
to get your writing to sound more like you and less like a lofty essay.
Always consider your audience. If you’re writing for only close friends and
family, you don’t need to explain that Sarah is your 8-year-old daughter every
time you mention her. But if your blog attracts a wider audience, you may
want to create references or glossaries to help new readers follow along.
Finally, before you start blogging, spend some time visiting other blogs that
are like the one you’re thinking of starting. Read one or two for a few weeks
and pay attention to things like the length of posts, frequency, writing style,
and subject material. You can get some great ideas for your own blog by
noting what you find interesting and compelling in other people’s blogs.
Update, update, update
The blogs that attract the most readers are the ones with frequent updates. If
you start a blog, be prepared to spend some time working on it every day or
two. If you’re going to be a blogger, you have to blog! It takes discipline for
most of us to write, even conversationally, every day. If you find yourself
dreading posting to your blog, maybe a blog isn’t for you.
As you go about your day, keep the blog in the back of your mind. You may
even want to carry a notebook where you can jot down reminders for topics
you want to blog about later. Start paying attention to the parts of your life
that are most interesting to you; those will likely be the areas your friends
and family are most interested in as well. Don’t be afraid to write about
everyday activities — parking tickets and car repairs — but don’t neglect
to talk about what you’re thinking and feeling. All these areas will make it
possible for you to update frequently.
281
Chapter 15: The Family Blog: Sharing Stories with an Online Journal

Having a co-blogger can take some of the pressure off, especially if all authors
contribute regularly. If you’re going to be working with several people on one
blog, talk over how often you expect each other to post so that you can keep
some focus and cohesion to your blog.
If you will be updating your blog on a weekly, biweekly, or monthly basis, try
to be consistent about when you add new posts so that your readers know
when to catch up. For example, you may choose to update your site every
Sunday evening.
Invite comments
One of the most important aspects of blogs is that they feature the writing of
the blogger as well as the comments of readers. When you visit a blog, you
often find a comment link under the text of each blog posting. Clicking that
link enables you to read comments from other people and submit your own.
Usually bloggers make their own comments in the posts on their site, but
sometimes a blogger adds a response in the comment section because it’s a
more direct way to address someone else’s comment.
Not all bloggers choose to implement the comment feature, but if you want to
develop a dialogue with your audience, comments are the best way to do so.
The comment feature is an easy way to involve your audience and get valu-
able feedback about what you’re doing with your blog.
If you do decide to allow comments on your blog, be sure to keep an eye on
them. The comment feature makes it possible for anyone to add comments
to your blog and you may not always like what they have to say. For example,
spammers sometimes take advantage of inattentive bloggers to do some mar-
keting that you may not want on your blog. All good blogging software makes
it easy for the author to remove comments. (You find more about software
options at the end of this chapter.)
Before You Blog
Blogs are a lot of fun for bloggers and readers, but you should consider some
issues before you get started. I’ve already mentioned the time and commit-
ment a blog requires. If your life is already busy and you don’t absolutely love
writing your blog, the likelihood is that you’ll put off posting and eventually
let your blog die. Guilt over infrequent posts can definitely increase your
stress load, so consider yourself warned.
282
Part IV: Creating Special Project Sites 

If I haven’t scared you off yet, the next thing you should consider is whether
to use your own name and those of your friends and family. Some bloggers
choose to remain anonymous to the general public to maintain some personal
privacy; others have decided that keeping an online journal is already so
public that they may as well use their name. This is a personal decision that
may be affected by the kinds of subjects you plan to discuss in your blog.
You should consider some legal and professional issues as well. You may be
tempted to talk about specific situations that made you angry — be careful
about identifying people you are upset with and making statements that
might be construed as libelous. Any written material that is untrue and harm-
ful can be the basis for legal action. For example, if you write about a current
or former employer in a way that you can’t prove to be true and that could be
construed as harmful to their business, you may risk legal action. Your family
may read with sympathy and support; others may not.
Even if you don’t write anything directly negative about your work, your
employer may become concerned about your blog (especially if they see that
you’re posting to it on company time). If you plan to talk about your profes-
sional life, think hard about how much you should reveal about life at the
office and be especially careful about what you say.
Finally, be aware that someone may become unhealthily interested in you or
your family. This has not been a common experience on the Net, but don’t
take unnecessary risks by providing your home address or phone number.
Some bloggers choose not to even identify the city they live in or the com-
pany they work for.
283

Bleeding-edge blogs
The snazziest blogs today are using some of the
most cutting-edge Internet technology avail-
able. Here’s a quick list of what’s hot and what
you can expect to see on more blogs in the
future:
 Moblogging: Blogging with photos, often
taken on-the-go with your mobile phone
and sent via your phone to your blog.
 RSS/XML feeds: RSS (Rich Site Summary)
is an Internet technology that can deliver
your posts to your reader’s computers or
notify them whenever you update your blog.
 Audblogging: Posting audio entries to your
blog by recording messages from your
phone (mobile or otherwise).

Comparing Blogging Software
and Services
Unless you want to build a custom blog, starting a blog requires little techni-
cal knowledge. If you have access to a computer and the Internet, you’ll find
special blog software solutions that can be set up in minutes — usually for
little to no cost. This section describes the options available.
Using a hosted blog service
Following are some of the most popular companies that provide blogging
solutions on the Web:
 Blogger, www.blogger.com/
 TypePad, www.typepad.com
 LiveJournal, www.livejournal.com
 Diaryland, www.diaryland.com
 MySpace, www.myspace.com
All provide a way for you to start a blog quickly and inexpensively.
Blogger, shown in Figure 15-7, is one of the best for beginners without much
technical know-how, and you can’t beat the price — it’s free! Setup takes
fewer than five minutes and you can start posting right away. When you set
up an account at Blogger, you must first enter a name for your blog and
choose one of the prefab designs. Your blog is hosted on Blogger’s servers,
and you log into their Web site to add posts to your blog.
Blogger is a great way to get started, but if you decide you want more features
and greater personalization options, consider purchasing one of the more
advanced programs, such as Moveable Type, covered in the next section.
Although American Online doesn’t call it blogging, they now offer online jour-
nals that function similar to a traditional blog. Visit hometown.aol.com to
find more about AOL’s online services. If you’re an AOL member, search for
the keyword Journal.
284
Part IV: Creating Special Project Sites 

Doing it yourself
Serious bloggers often opt to purchase blogging software that they can install
and customize on their own server. Although this option is not for the techni-
cally faint of heart, the resulting control, especially of your site’s design, may
be worth the investment of time and money. This solution also means that
your postings are not vulnerable to the whims of a commercial company,
which might change its policies or close its doors.
If you choose this option, you’ll also want to register a domain name and
select a Web hosting company. You find information about how to take care
of both these tasks in Chapters 3 and 4, respectively. If you’re setting up Web
hosting to run blogging software, make sure the hosting service you choose
includes the ability to install software on the server. You’ll also want to be
sure that any required programs or technologies needed to run blog updating
software are available to you. You should be able to find any necessary soft-
ware on the Web site of the company that sells the blogging software.
Two of the most robust blog software systems are
 Movable Type, www.movabletype.org/
 pMachine Pro, www.pmachine.com/
Licensing fees vary depending on what features you need, but noncommer-
cial pricing, which is lower, is available. Both programs must be installed on
your Web server and require some technical experience (although you’ll find
detailed instructions on their Web sites).

I’ll add them to my family site at www.digitalfamily.com and try to include

Earning Clams at Whyville
www.whyville.net
When members of the online community at Whyville were challenged with
reporting on winter Solstice celebrations around the world, many quickly
determined that the best strategy was to recruit an international team and
compare notes. That wasn’t so hard in a virtual world in which half the 
members come from outside the U.S. The real challenge came when they

wanted to celebrate their success and discovered they’d first have to find
how to negotiate different time zones. Most of them were only 12 or 13, with
early bed times.
No one assigned the task of studying time zones, but then much of the learn-
ing that happens at Whyville isn’t assigned, it’s discovered. That’s just one of
the secrets of success in this online learning environment, which is also get-
ting attention from adults who hope to apply some of the lessons acquired in
Whyville to online communities for grownups.
Whyville.net, shown in Figure 16-1, is run by Numedeon Inc. It was started
in 1999 by a small group of scientists, educators, and Internet experts who
wanted to create a place where young people could find out about science
through experience, not just by memorizing terms.
Whyville is a 3-D world where you can take a virtual bus around town, get-
ting off at activity-filled places such as the Center for Disease Control, the
Currency Exchange, or the House of Illusions. If you want something changed
in Whyville, you can start a petition at City Hall; with enough votes, you can
get your idea implemented. Members earn “clams” by solving science prob-
lems, getting published in the Whyville Times, or developing a business in
Whyville’s burgeoning entrepreneurial environment. The extent to which
kids are acquiring business skills at Whyville is another development that’s
attracting attention from other sites.

information by entering a real question, such as, “Why is the ocean full of
fish?” The kid’s site, shown in Figure 16-3, features a wealth of resources
including a kid-friendly dictionary, thesaurus, almanac, atlas, and clip art

Ten Web Design Tips
In This Chapter
 Keep it simple
 Break up your pages with white space
 Back up your site
 Be consistent
 Stay small and fast
 Follow the three clicks rule
 Map it out
 Avoid distracting animations
 Don’t cram your pages
 Work as a team
O
ne of the advantages of working with a team of other Web designers is
that you get to compare notes and trade ideas. You may not have this
luxury if you’re designing a site for your family, so in this chapter I collected
design tips from a variety of sources. I hope they help you create a functional
and beautiful Web site for your family.
Keep It Simple
Creating a clear and intuitive navigational system is one of the most important
elements in creating a Web site. Nothing is likely to frustrate your visitors more
than not being able to find what they’re looking for.
Make sure that visitors can easily get to all the main sections of your site
from every page in the site. You can best do this by placing at the top or side
of every page a set of links to each main section. This set of links is called a
navigation row or navigation bar, and it’s a common feature on well-designed
sites. If the pages are very long, consider including a navigation bar at the
bottom of the page as well. The bottom of the page is also an ideal place to
include basic contact information.

Your goal is to make sure that viewers don’t have to use the Back button in
their browsers to move around your site.
Break Up Your Pages with White Space
One of the best design features you can add to a page is nothing at all —
also known as white space. Understand that white space, in this case, is not
always white; it’s simply space that you haven’t crammed full of text or
images. It can be any color, but it’s usually most effective if it’s the color or
pattern of your background.
White space gives the eye a rest — something readers need when they’re
staring at a computer monitor. You can use white space to separate one type
of information from another and to focus the viewer’s attention where you
want it most. Some of the most beautiful and compelling designs on the Web
use only a few well-thought-out elements against lots of white space.
Back Up Your Site
Make sure you have a system in place to back up your Web site. Even the
best Internet service providers have technical problems, so you should keep
a backup of your site where you have easy access to it and can get it back
online quickly. Update the copy regularly to make sure you have the latest
version of your site backed up.
Also keep a backup of your original source files. For example, when
you develop images for the Web, you usually start in a program such as
Photoshop, creating a high-resolution image that may include layers and
other elements. Before the image goes on your Web site, those layers are 
flattened and the image is compressed or reduced and converted to a GIF or
JPEG file. If you ever want to go back and alter that image, you’ll want the
original source file. Whether you create your own images or hire a profes-
sional designer, make sure you develop a system for saving the original text,
images, and other content.
Be Consistent
Most Web sites work best, and are easiest to navigate, when they follow a
consistent design. Case in point: Most readers take for granted that books
don’t change their design from page to page, and that newspapers don’t
302
Part V: The Part of Tens 

change headline fonts and logos from day to day. Consistency is one of the
primary tools used in books and newspapers to make it easy for readers to
distinguish different elements and follow a story or theme.
As you lay out your Web page, keep related items close to one another and
be consistent about how you design similar content elements. You want your
viewers to instantly understand which pieces of information are related to
each other. Distinguish different kinds of information by their
 Design
 Location
 Prominence
This type of organization makes following information visually much easier.
Make sure that similar elements follow the same design parameters, such as
type style, banner size, and page background color. Give elements of similar
importance the same weight on a page. If you use too many different elements
on a page or on the same Web site, you’ll confuse your viewers.
To ensure a consistent style, define a set of colors, shapes, or other elements
that you use throughout the site. Choose two or three fonts for your Web site
and use those consistently as well. Using too many fonts makes your pages
less appealing and harder to read.
Strive for consistency in your designs — except when you’re trying to be
unpredictable. A little surprise here and there can keep your Web site alive.
Stay Small and Fast
Despite the promises about the arrival of unlimited bandwidth, the biggest
problem on the Internet is still speed. If you make sure your pages download
quickly, your viewers will be more likely to keep clicking. You may create the
best design ever to grace the Web, but if it takes too long to appear on your
viewer’s screens, no one will wait around long enough to compliment you on
your design talents.
If your page designs take a long time to download, here are a few likely rea-
sons and suggestions for how to make them load faster. First, take a look at
multimedia elements and consider reducing the size or at least offering users
the option to skip large multimedia files, such as Flash animations. You don’t
want to make users wait too long to see the first page of your site. If you sus-
pect that static images are the problem, consider reducing the size of the
303
Chapter 17: Ten Web Design Tips

images or using optimization methods, such as compression or color reduc-
tion, which make file sizes smaller so images download faster. Optimization
and other image techniques are described in Chapter 6.
Follow the Three Clicks Rule
The three clicks rule states that no important piece of information should
ever be more than three clicks away from anywhere else on your Web site.
The most important information should be even closer. Some information,
such as contact information, should never be more than one click away.
You can make finding information easy for viewers by creating a site map
(as explained in the next section) and a navigation bar (as explained in the
“Keep It Simple” section).
Map It Out
As your site gets larger, providing easy access to all the information on your
Web site may get harder and harder. A great solution is to provide a site map,
which is an outline or a diagram that illustrates the hierarchy and content of
your site and includes links to the most important pages in the site.
The site map can get complicated and busy if you have a lot of pages and
links, so it’s usually best to create a site map in outline form. Don’t put lots of
graphics in your site map — it should be functional above all else. A site map
doesn’t have to look pretty; it has to make it easy for your visitors to get to
any page on the site.
Avoid Distracting Animations
A little motion brings the Web to life. Too much motion distracts viewers
from what you want them to read and see.
When something is flashing in the corner of your eye, reading what’s in front
of you can be difficult. Animations are a great way to grab attention, but make
sure you’re not taking attention away from the rest of your site. Creating ani-
mations that repeat only a few times is a great compromise. Many animation
304
Part V: The Part of Tens 

programs enable you to set the number of loops (the number of times the ani-
mation repeats). I recommend that you let an animation run for three loops
(or sequences) and then make it stop. Your visitors can always reload the
page if they want to see the animation again.
Create animations that look great, attract attention, and then stop moving so
your viewers can focus on the rest of the material on your pages.
Don’t Cram Your Pages
Don’t overwhelm your pages (and readers) with graphics, banners, frames,
or other gimmicks. Likewise, avoid large graphics that can take forever to
download. Give readers a few broad choices on the front page and then let
them narrow their quest for the information they need as they progress
through your site. Many designers recommend no more than four to eight
links and no more than three images on any page.
Work as a Team
The best Web sites are created by teams of developers that include experi-
enced programmers, designers, and editors. Remember that as you start
to build your own Web site, and don’t expect your site to have the flash of
professional sites.
That said, why not create your own team of specialists? Do you have a
teenager who studied programming in school? An aunt or an uncle who is a
talented designer? Should mom or dad take on the role of project manager or
should they be the ones to test everyone else’s work and let an older sibling
manage the development process?
If you start with the vision that everyone in your family can contribute some-
thing, you may find that building a family Web site is a great way not only to
stay in touch with distant family and friends but also to bring your family
together around a shared project.
Even the youngest members of your family can contribute by creating artwork
that you then scan, bringing color and fun to a Web site page. (You find tips
and suggestions for managing your project in Chapter 2.)

on’t think that you’re finished with your site just because you’ve pub-
lished it online. A good Web designer is never finished — you can always
add more information, test your pages and links to make sure everything func-
tions properly, and find ways to promote your Web site so friends and family
will come and see your great work.
In this chapter, you find tips about adding new stories and images to your
Web site, finding and correcting broken links, and using e-cards to invite
people to visit your new site.

Send an E-card to Announce 
Your New Site
Many people send a simple e-mail message to promote their Web sites. That
can work fine, but it’s even more fun to send an e-card with a colorful charac-
ter, animation, and music to dramatize your announcement.
Hallmark.com is one of my favorite e-card sites because it has lots of
free cards with clever sayings, professional designs, and interactive anima-
tions. Most of the free e-cards at Hallmark.com even include sound. Blue
Mountain.com is another great e-card site, but you have to pay for the plea-
sure of sending their professional greetings.
When choosing an e-card to announce your Web site, look for blank cards or
the Friendship and Any Occasion sections, where you’ll find messages that
are easily personalized.
Make Your Site Easy to Find
Search engines can make it easier for friends and family to find you, but you
have to be listed on them first. The good news is that registering your site
with most search engines is simple and free. Google and Yahoo!, the two most
important search engines, include a link on their home page for adding your
URL to their database. After you add your Web address to a search engine,
the address becomes available in the matches when someone searches for
your Web site.
Here are a few tips to make it easier to add your Web address to the two most
popular search engines:
 Google: By far the most popular search engine, Google is the place most
people look when they want to find something on the Web. To make
sure you’re included in their search feature, point your browser to www.
google.com and click the About Google link at the bottom of the page.
Then click the Submitting Your Site link and enter the Web address of
your site in the URL field. For example, to submit the site I created for
this book, I entered www.digitalfamily.com.
 Yahoo!: Respected as the first search engine on the Web, Yahoo! is
another important place to submit your Web site. To make sure you’re
included on Yahoo!, point your browser to www.yahoo.com and scroll
down to the bottom of the page. Click the How to Suggest a Site link at
the bottom left of the page. Like many search engines, Yahoo! includes
free and paid submission options. Click on Submit Your Site for Free to
add your URL at no cost.
308
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Although hundreds of search services are available on the Web, Yahoo! and
Google are by far the most important. If you’re just trying to make your family
Web site a little easier for friends and family to find if they don’t already know
your address, submitting your site to these two is probably all you need to do.
If you want to make sure you’re listed in more places, a wide array of services
are available to help you. However, most search engine submission services
charge to help you get high rankings and no one can guarantee you top billing
in any search engine. Why can’t anyone guarantee your placement in a search
engine? Because search engines intentionally make their criteria for matches
secret to try to prevent sites from forcing their way to the top. Sites such as
Google consider several factors when ranking Web sites and their criteria can
change from week to week or month to month as they strive to provide better
results.
Update Regularly
Many families have regularly scheduled phone dates, such as every Sunday
evening or every Saturday morning. The routine of these calls helps family
members know what to expect and when they can find each other at home.
If you want your visitors to know when to look for updates, consider making
changes to your Web site on a regular basis. I like updating my family Web site
every Saturday morning with new photos and stories. That way, my friends
and loved ones know that they can always log in on the weekends to get the
latest reports.
Wait Until New Technologies 
Are Widely Supported
A big mistake novice Web designers make is to try to use every new tool and
technique as it becomes available. Although it may be fun to show off the latest
bells and whistles of the Web, most Internet users lag behind new innovations
and may not be able to see your handiwork.
With a family Web site, you’re likely to be serving an audience that is not on
the cutting edge of technology, so you should be careful about updating your
site with the latest innovations. In general, wait to use a new technology until
it’s been on the Web for one to three years or until common browsers support
it so users don’t need a plug in. Adobe’s Portable Document Format (PDF), for
example, was problematic in the early days because users needed to down-
load a special program to view a file in PDF. Today, both Netscape and Internet
309
Chapter 18: Ten Tips for Testing, Updating, and Promoting Your Site

Explorer browsers support PDFs and the format is commonly used for forms,
brochures, and other documents that require special formatting.
If you really love a new technology and just have to use it on your site, at
least try to provide an alternative. For example, if you create a section of
your site that requires a special plug-in to view a 3-D virtual tour of your new
house, you might also create an alternative Web page that features static 2-D
photographs so that visitors who don’t have the 3-D plug-in and don’t want to
download it can still get a glimpse of your new home.
Make Your Pages Load Quickly
No matter how beautiful your site or how many great images and stories it
has, your friends and family may never see them if the pages take too long to
download.
You can use a number of techniques to help ensure that your pages load
quickly for your visitors, but the most important involve reducing the file size
of your images and multimedia files. Text loads quickly, but pictures can take
a while. Video, audio, and animation files are usually the biggest and take the
longest to download.
To find out how long it will take for a page on your Web site to download,
visit www.websiteoptimization.com. You can enter any URL into this free
online service and get a report that shows how many seconds it will take for
that page to load at a variety of connection speeds. For example, I entered
www.pets.com and got the following results:
Connection Rate
Download Time
14.4K
129.21 seconds
28.8K
64.71 seconds
33.6K
55.49 seconds
56K
33.37 seconds
ISDN 128K
10.36 seconds
T1 1.44Mbps
1.08 seconds
There is no magic answer to how long your pages should take for your view-
ers, but faster is always better. In general, I recommend you make sure you
site doesn’t take more than 30 seconds on a 56K modem.

Part V: The Part of Tens 

In Chapters 5 and 6 you find a number of tips for reducing the time it takes
for your images to download. And in Chapter 10 you find descriptions of the
best formats for multimedia on the Web and instructions for linking audio,
video, and animation to your pages.
Test Your Links
It’s relatively easy to create links on a Web site (especially if you use a pro-
gram such as FrontPage, which is covered in Chapter 8). Unfortunately, it’s
also relatively easy to break links by moving files around, deleting files or
images, or just typing a URL or Web address incorrectly.
As you build your Web site, it’s important to check your links, but don’t stop
there. After you publish your pages to your Web server, you should check
them again.
You can check links by simply viewing your own pages with a browser and
systematically clicking each link to make sure it works. An easier way, how-
ever, is to use the Link Valet, available at
www.htmlhelp.com/tools/valet/
Just enter the URL of your Web site into the Check Site box, and Link Valet
will check every link on your site to make sure that it works. The test usually
takes just a few seconds. When it’s finished you’ll get a detailed report on the
links on your site, with broken links marked in red so they’re easy to find.
If you discover broken links on your Web site, you can use FrontPage to cor-
rect them. For more on setting links in FrontPage, see Chapter 8.
Ask Friends and Family to Test Your Site
Even though your Web site looks good to you, that doesn’t mean it will look
good to everyone else. One of the most common problems I’ve seen on the
Web happens when designers create pages with very small type — as people
get older, most of us find that it’s harder to read small print.
Make sure you design your site with those with limited eyesight in mind.
Better yet, ask them to review your designs. A fresh set of eyes can help you
find mistakes you may have missed and point out problems that may not be
apparent to you.
311
Chapter 18: Ten Tips for Testing, Updating, and Promoting Your Site

Make It Easy for Visitors to Contact You
Don’t assume that all your visitors have your contact information. Although
some families prefer not to post their street address or home phone number
on their Web site (for privacy reasons), I do recommend that you at least
include an e-mail address. Even if most of your visitors already have your
contact information at home, your Web site can be a handy place to find it.
You never know when a friend may be traveling without his or her contact
list, or a loved one may lose an address book and appreciate being able to
find your contact information from your easy-to-find Web site.
I also recommend that you invite feedback from your visitors. If you want to
make your Web site better and more enjoyable for your visitors, ask them
what they want to see on your site and how you can make it easier for them
to use it.
Test for Accessibility
Making your Web site accessible means making sure anyone can access the
information on your pages. Internet users who are blind or have limited
vision use synthetic speech synthesizers to “read” Web sites and refreshable
Braille displays that translate Web content. But if you don’t design your site
to be accessible to these special programs, users may not be able to under-
stand the information on your pages.
An estimated 10 percent of the Internet audience in the United States can’t
view a site that does not comply with accessibility requirements, and that seg-
ment is expected to increase as more Americans over the age of 55 choose
to use browsers with speech synthesizers. These programs are also used by
people who can’t use their hands well enough to work a keyboard or a mouse.
Designing a site that’s accessible requires a little more attention to detail, but
making your site inviting to everyone is mostly just about following good
interface and design rules.
And the benefits go far beyond reaching people with disabilities. Accessible
Web design also makes sites work better in language translation programs and
can help ensure that content displays well in some of the newest browsers,
such as those for PDAs and other wireless devices.
Here are a few tips for creating accessible Web sites:
 Use alternative text for images and multimedia. Also known as alt text,
alternative text is an option in HTML (the language used to create Web
pages) that provides a text description if the image or multimedia file
312
Part V: The Part of Tens 

can’t be displayed. Alternative text is especially important when you use
images as links because screen readers can’t decipher text in an image.
 Create links that have clear descriptions about where they go, group
related information together, and be consistent about where navigation
links are located so they are easy to find on all your pages.
 Choose colors carefully. If you’re distinguishing sections of your site
with color coding, remember that color differences won’t mean anything
to someone who can’t see them. Also be careful to provide enough con-
trast between text and background colors so that those who are visually
impaired can still decipher the words. For example, light-colored text
on a light background is much harder to read than dark text on a light
background.
 If you use multimedia, provide transcripts of audio and text descriptions
of video and animation files.
 Test your site at the Center for Applied Special Technology site. To use
their free service, visit www.cast.org/bobby and enter the address of
any Web site into their online testing tool, called Bobby. You get a free
report listing errors or omissions that may limit accessibility.
 Try this simple test to see how well the content and links on your site are
organized. Imagine that you’re reading your Web site to someone over
the phone. Start at the top of the page and read all the content from left
to right. Does it make sense? How long would it take the person on the
other end of the phone to find the information he or she wanted if this
was the only way the person could access the information on your site?
To find more about accessible design, visit www.webable.com.
Visit Other Web Sites for Ideas
One of the best ways to acquire good habits in Web design is to visit other
people’s Web sites and study what works and what doesn’t on their pages.
As you look at other family Web sites, ask yourself these questions: What do
you like about the site, and why? Can you easily find the information you are
most interested in? How do you navigate around the site? Are animations and
other multimedia elements useful or distracting? Do the images load quickly?
Is the text easy to read?
Sometimes the best way to discover the problems in your own site is to look
for problems on someone else’s Web site and then come back to your own
with a fresh perspective. Chapter 1 includes a list of Web sites you can use
as examples, and you’ll find even more in the family section at Yahoo!

Calendar and Genealogy
Resources
O
ne of the challenges of creating a Web site is that you have so many serv-
ices and software programs to choose from. To help you find two of the
most popular online services — calendar and genealogy resources — I’ve put
together this list of some of the best sites and services available.
In the following pages, you find calendar systems you can add to your Web
site, genealogy services, and family tree software. For recommendations
about Web design and image software, see Chapter 1. For suggestions about
video editing software, see Chapter 10.
Calendar Programs
If you have trouble keeping track of all the important dates, appointments, and
special events in your family, consider adding a calendar to your Web site proj-
ect. Many of the online calendar services make it possible for multiple people
to use the same system, so everyone with your password can view and add to
each other’s schedules. You can link these calendars to your family Web site
or use them independently (in case you don’t want everyone in the family to
know your schedule):
 Yahoo! Calendar (yahoo.calendar.com): This free service is one of the
most widely used calendar programs. You can choose from a gallery of
images so that each month (or week or whatever) will have a different
picture (see Figure A-1). You can choose who to share your calendar
with — which is useful if you’re trying to keep track of the location and
time of dance recitals or soccer practices, and you want everyone else
to be aware of the dates as well. Yahoo! also has a handy feature that
enables you to sync their online calendar with your Palm or Outlook
program. You can choose which holidays you want to have listed, and
set reminders (so you will never again forget important dates, such as
the South African Day of Reconciliation).

 MyEvents (www.myevents.com): This online calendar service offers a free
introductory period and then charges about $4 a month. Besides all the
standard calendar functions (keeping track of dates, sharing the calendar,
sending reminders), MyEvents also includes contact manager and orga-
nizer features. These functions can be integrated with Palm and Outlook.
The site also features limited file storage and photo album options.
 Connect Daily (www.mhsoftware.com): You can test out this service
before paying for it by downloading a free version of the software. This
sophisticated time-management software is designed for businesses and
organizations and may be more than your family needs, but if you’re
trying to coordinate an entire softball team, PTA, or other group, you
may appreciate the added features.
Genealogy Services and 
Family Tree Programs
The Internet has made it easier than ever to research family histories and
trace your roots. The following services and software programs can help you
with your research and with designing a family tree that you can link to from
your Web site:

 Ancestry.com (www.ancestry.com): Boasting the largest collection of
family history records on the Web, this popular site, shown in Figure A-2,
features census records, immigration information, marriage and death
records, and more — all organized in easy-to-use searchable databases.
The site offers a free 14-day trial and then charges a fee for continued
use of these and other services.
 Genealogy.com (www.genealogy.com): If you want to broaden your
search, try the services at Genealogy.com, as shown in Figure A-3.
This site also provides a free 14-day trial period.
 FamilyTreeMaker.com (www.familytreemaker.com): If you’ve ever
tried to draw a family tree, you know how complicated it can be to
create all the lines and boxes that you need to make your family
history make sense. Save yourself the trouble and consider investing
in FamilyTreeMaker. This program, which costs less than $30, makes it
easy to organize large amounts of family history information, and it’s
fully integrated with Ancestry.com so you can use the two in tandem.
 FamilyTreeSearcher (www.familytreesearcher.com): Although the
information on this site may not be as extensive as what you find at
Ancestry.com, the price is right. This free service provides search 
features and lots of great advice about researching your ancestors.

Elements. See also animation.
animation: A series of images that, when displayed one after the other, cre-
ates the effect of movement.
antialiasing: A process that gives the illusion of smoothing the jagged edges
of a graphic by intermixing pixels of adjoining colors along the edges of the
graphic.
application: Any program (such as a word processor, spreadsheet, database,
or desktop publishing program) that performs functions for a user.
application server: Helps the Web server to process specially marked Web
pages. When the browser requests one of these pages, the Web server hands

off the page to the application server, which processes it before sending the
page to the browser.
attachment: An electronic file (such as text or a graphic) that’s sent along
with an e-mail message.
attribute: A part of the HTML specification that modifies the behavior of a tag
as well as the text, graphic, or other element that the tag describes.
AVI: For Audio Video Interleave. A Windows-native animation format similar
to QuickTime.
background: A solid color, an image, or a textured pattern that appears
behind the text and graphics on a Web page.
bandwidth: The amount of data that can be sent through a communications
channel. Represents the Internet’s carrying capacity. Some types of informa-
tion, such as graphics, take up more bandwidth than others, such as text.
batch processing: Performing the same function on many files or documents
at the same time.
baud: A measure of the speed at which data transmits. Baud rate indicates
the number of bits of data transmitted in one second. One baud is equal to
one bit per second. Common modems today have baud rates of 33,600, or
56,000 kilobits per second (Kbps).
beta version: The last stages of development of a computer program before
it’s ready to be sold to the public. The beta version of the program is released
to a select group of users for testing for errors, or bugs. Many companies now
make beta versions of their software programs available to the public for free
before releasing the final version.
bit: The smallest piece of information a computer uses. Bits are combined in
various ways to represent different types of information. Eight bits form a byte.
bitmapped image: A graphic formed by an array of dots (pixels) on a screen.

find something of interest, as in browsing through folders (directories) or
browsing the Web.
322
Part VI: Appendixes 

browser: A program, such as Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Internet Explorer,
that’s used along with an Internet connection to view pages on the Web.
byte: A measurement of computer storage. One byte equals eight bits.
cache: Pronounced cash. A special section of RAM or disk memory that’s set
aside to store frequently accessed information. Cache is used also as a verb
to refer to the act of storing such information. Many Web browsers cache
information on your computer to help download Web pages more quickly.
CGI script: CGI stands for Common Gateway Interface. A program that pro-
vides greater levels of interactivity than basic HTML by passing information
from browsers to servers using forms or queries. Many Web sites use CGI
scripts to perform functions such as online discussion areas and shopping
systems. These scripts are written in sophisticated programming languages
such as Perl, C, and C++.
chat: Real-time written discussion that takes place on the Internet.
client: The Internet is a client/server arrangement. The client (usually a Web
browser) is the end-user side, which usually resides on a personal computer
and communicates with a Web server. See also server.
close tag: Also called end tag. An HTML tag that designates the end of a for-
matting section, usually the same as the opening tag but with a forward slash
mark. For example, the close <CENTER> tag is </CENTER>. See also start tag.
compressed file: A data file modified to consume less space, often by using a
program such as WinZip or StuffIt. Prior to use, a compressed file must be
decompressed.
contact link: Links to the site developer’s e-mail address, to an e-mail form, or
to a page of e-mail addresses for key contacts. Makes contacting the people
behind the Web site easy for Web site viewers. 
cookie: Information stored on your hard drive by a program on a Web site that
you visit. This information is used to track your preferences and activities as
you use the site and if you return to it later. Cookie technology enables a Web
site to greet you by name, remember your password, and provide custom
information. Cookies are controversial because some people view them as
an invasion of privacy. Most of the latest browsers enable you to prevent
cookies from being stored on your computer.
cross-platform: Having versions for more than one operating system, such as
UNIX, Macintosh, and Windows XP. Can also refer to applications, such as
those created in Java, that run across multiple, incompatible computer sys-
tems with little or no modification.
323
Appendix B: Glossary

CSS: For Cascading Style Sheets. Part of the HTML specification that enables
you to define style properties (such as font, color, and spacing) and then
make global formatting changes by applying those styles, similar to the way
you use styles in word processing and desktop publishing programs.
cyberspace: The entire world of online information and services. Coined by
William Gibson is his novel Neuromancer.
database: A collection of information compiled in one or more tables, with
fields organized in columns and records in rows.
database program: Enables the collection of data in an organized format, 
permitting manipulation of the data in a variety of ways. Examples include
FileMaker Pro, Access, FoxPro, and dBASE.
default: A condition set automatically in a program when no explicit selec-
tion is made. In HTML, the value assigned to an attribute when none is 
supplied.
desktop: In a graphical environment, a term assigned to the always open file
folder that you first see when your computer finishes booting up. In Windows,
the physical path to the desktop is c:\windows\desktop. Desktops are tra-
ditionally decorated with background images and can include shortcuts to
programs, files, and folders.
desktop publishing program: An application used to typeset publications

Appendix C: About the CD

Author-created material 
In the Author Files section of the CD, you’ll find a number of files that I’ve
created to go with this book. First, you find a collection of multimedia files in
a variety of formats, such as MPEG, Windows Media, and QuickTime. I included
these files so that you’d have what you need to follow the exercises in Chap-
ter 10 and to help you appreciate the levels of quality you can expect from
different multimedia formats and compression settings.
The rest of what you’ll find on the CD is a collection of Web site templates and
graphics that you can use to create your own custom Web sites. Chapters 11
through 14 are designed to help you create a specific kind of Web site, such
as a baby site or a wedding site. In each of the corresponding folders on the
CD, you’ll find everything you need — templates, graphics, and even a com-
pleted sample site.
When you copy images from a CD to your hard drive, you may find that the
files are locked, meaning you can’t save changes to them. To correct this on a
PC, right-click the folder name and choose Properties. In the Attributes area
of the Properties dialog box, deselect the Read Only option. Click Apply, and
then click OK. If you’re using a Mac, Ô-click the folder name, choose Get Info,
and deselect the Locked option.

Troubleshooting
I tried my best to compile programs that work on most computers with the
minimum system requirements. Alas, your computer may differ, and some
programs may not work properly for some reason.
342
Part VI: Appendixes 

The two likeliest problems are that your system doesn’t have enough memory
(RAM) for the programs you want to use, or you have other programs running
that are affecting the installation or running of a program. If you get an error
message such as Not enough memory or Setup cannot continue, try one
or more of the following suggestions and then try using the software again:
 Turn off any antivirus software running on your computer. Installation
programs sometimes mimic virus activity and may make your computer
incorrectly believe that a virus is infecting it.
 Close all running programs. The more programs you have running, the
less memory is available to other programs. Installation programs typi-
cally update files and programs; so if you keep other programs running,
installation may not work properly.
 Have your local computer store add more RAM to your computer. This
is, admittedly, a drastic and somewhat expensive step. However, adding
more memory can really help the speed of your computer and allow
more programs to run at the same time.
