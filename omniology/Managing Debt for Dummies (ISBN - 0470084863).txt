achieve his dream by combining journalism with the law. Therefore,
he earned an undergraduate degree in journalism and a law degree
from the University of Houston Law School. Later, he and a partner
established a law firm in Texas, building it into one of the most suc-
cessful consumer bankruptcy firms in the state. He subsequently
began a successful consumer law firm in South Texas.

coauthored or ghostwritten numerous books on topics related to

Authors’ Acknowledgments
Thanks to Joan Friedman, the editor for this book. Despite relocat-
ing to Texas from Indiana with her family in the middle of this pro-
ject and having to get her family settled before the start of school,
Joan made the editing process a breeze and was a pleasure to work
with. This book is a far better product because of her. A big thanks
as well to Kathryn Perron, our technical reviewer, for her queries
and comments.
Mary would also like to thank her husband, Rodney Root, for his
constant support while she toiled away for endless hours this
summer in front of her computer and for his willingness to do more
than his share of the housework and errand-running so she could
enjoy her down time.

Introduction
C
all us clairvoyant: You’re concerned about how much you owe
to your creditors. Join the crowd! We won’t even try to guess
how many people are worried about their debts as we write these
words. Suffice it to say the number is staggering, and it keeps on
growing.
As we write, total consumer debt has skyrocketed to a whopping
$2.2 trillion dollars. Data from the Federal Reserve Board shows
that the annual rate of consumer debt has risen throughout this
decade, driven primarily by revolving credit — mostly credit card
debt. Statistics show that people in the United States now spend
more than they take home; they make up the difference by drawing
down their savings, using credit, or not paying all their financial
obligations. These dismal facts are fueled by a variety of factors,
including higher energy and healthcare costs; stagnant wages; easy
access to credit; rising interest rates; inadequate savings; and poor
understanding of basic money management.
Whether you picked up this book because you’re drowning in debt
and looking for a financial life raft or because you’re just feeling
uncomfortable about the amount you owe to your creditors, we’re
here to help. In this book, we show you how to assess the state of
your finances; live on what you make; get your debts paid off as
quickly as possible; and deal with high-risk debts like your mort-
gage, car loan, and federal taxes.
When your financial problems are behind you (which will happen if
you put our advice into action), we prepare you for your financial
future. We walk you through the credit rebuilding process and
explain the basics about credit and debt and money management.
About This Book
You won’t find any how-to-get-out-of-debt-overnight advice in
Managing Debt For Dummies. We know that slow and steady wins
the race. Getting out of debt takes time — months or even years,
depending on how much you owe relative to your income. Despite
what some ads claim, there are no shortcuts to debt reduction.

Getting out of debt may also require a lot of hard work and sacri-
fice. For example, for your family to meet its financial obligations
without using credit, you may have to slash your spending to the
bare bones and work at a second (or even a third) job.
But here’s the great news: If you follow the advice in this book,
your debt will diminish. Eventually, you’ll have more disposable
income, and you’ll start to gain financial peace of mind. You’ll even
be able to put money away for your family’s financial future and
work toward such goals as buying your own home, taking a vaca-
tion, helping pay for your kids’ college educations, and funding
your retirement.
As you already know, getting into debt is easy. Getting out is not. In
this book, we provide everything you need to meet that challenge.
Conventions Used in This Book
We’ve tried to make Managing Debt For Dummies as user friendly
as possible. After all, you have enough stress in your life; you don’t
need a book that’s tough to navigate! Here are some of the conven-
tions we use throughout the book:
 When we introduce a new term, it appears in italics. We pro-
vide a definition or explanation nearby.
 We use sidebars (gray boxes with their own headings that are
set apart from the rest of the text) to share information that
isn’t crucial but may be interesting to you.
 All Web addresses appear in monofont so they’re easy to pick
out if you need to go back and find them.
Keep in mind that when this book was printed, some Web
addresses may have needed to break across two lines of text. If
that happened, rest assured that we haven’t put in any extra char-
acters (such as hyphens) to indicate the break. When you use one
of these Web addresses, type in exactly what you see in this book,
pretending as though the line break doesn’t exist.
What You’re Not to Read
Of course, we think that every word in this book is essential read-
ing. But we’re not going to check up on you to make sure you’re
studying each chapter in depth!
Managing Debt For Dummies 
2

You can certainly skip the sidebars if you’re crunched for time,
and we hope that some chapters in Part III of this book don’t
apply to you. (If every one of them does apply to you, you have
our sympathy — your stress level must be extraordinary!)
Foolish Assumptions
We assume that because you’re taking the time to read these
words, you’re serious about wanting to get out and stay out of
debt, and you’re willing to do whatever it takes to achieve that
goal. That’s great, because the road to financial health is not
always smooth.
We also assume that you don’t know very much about money man-
agement. Don’t be embarrassed, and don’t let that fact prevent you
from taking action against your debt. Most U.S. consumers need
help with basic money management and in this book, we offer
exactly that.
How This Book Is Organized
We’ve packed this book full of information and advice to help you
tackle your debts and move your finances onto sounder ground,
and we’ve organized everything into five parts.
Part I: Getting a Grip
on Your Finances
We have three goals for this part of the book: give you an overview
of what’s involved in getting control of your finances and dealing
with your debts; guide you through the preliminary steps in the
debt management process; and help you get your game face on.
Maybe you have been determinedly uninformed about exactly how
much you owe to your creditors and how that compares to your
income. Maybe you haven’t wanted to know how badly your debts
have damaged your credit history. We help you face facts about
the state of your finances.
We encourage you to take a hard look at your relationship with
money and to determine whether that relationship has contributed
to your debt problems. We also help you develop a can-do attitude
about getting out of debt because your attitude can mean the dif-
ference between success and failure.

Part II: Going on a Debt Diet
In this part, you find the nuts and bolts of debt management. We
walk you through the budget-building process and explain how to
use your budget to manage your money. We suggest ways to spend
less and make more, and we show you how to use a variety of debt
management strategies that make it easier to keep up with your
debt payments. We also show you how a credit counseling agency
can help you (and how to find a good one), and we explain how to
act when debt collectors come calling.
Part III: Tackling Your 
High-Stake Debts
In this part, we focus on specific kinds of debts, like mortgages, car
loans, rent, court-ordered child support, federal taxes, and federal
student loans. We tell you what’s at stake when you fall behind on
each type of debt, and we offer options for avoiding the negative
consequences.
Part IV: Avoiding Debt Problems
down the Road
Ah, here’s where things get easier. In this part, we assume that
most of your debt problems are in the past and, having followed
the advice in this book, you’re wiser about your money now. We
show you how to rebuild your credit history, build your savings,
set financial goals, and use credit as a tool for managing your
money and building your wealth. Here’s to a happier and finan-
cially healthier future!
Part V: The Part of Tens
What would a For Dummies book be without this part? Not a For
Dummies book, we guess. First, we turn you on to an array of free
and low-cost resources for finding out more about debt manage-
ment and financial management in general. Then we help you avoid
some of the more common mistakes consumers make when they
owe too much money to their creditors.

Part I
Getting a Grip on
Your Finances

In this part . . .
O
ur goal in this book is to help you work your way out
of debt, and we start that process by tackling some
preliminaries. First, you need to get clear about the facts
of your ﬁnancial situation: Exactly how much are you
spending each month relative to your household income?
How much debt do you have? What do your credit report
and credit score say about the state of your ﬁnances? And
how do your ﬁnances stack up against the standard ratios
that ﬁnancial professionals use to evaluate someone’s
ﬁnancial health?
Facing the truth about your ﬁnances is tough, and muster-
ing the self-discipline to make necessary sacriﬁces is even
tougher. But don’t despair: In this part, we also give you
lots of advice and encouragement to help you develop a
get-out-of debt mindset.

The Basics of Managing
Too Much Debt
In This Chapter
 Figuring out where you stand financially
 Knowing what to do when you owe too much
 Dealing with debt collectors
 Handling your most important debts
 Building your financial future
G
oing into debt is as American as Mom’s apple pie and fireworks
on the Fourth of July. It’s the American way! Unfortunately, if
it’s also your way, you may be so deep in debt that you live paycheck
to paycheck, using credit cards and home equity loans to make ends
meet and pay for unexpected expenses. Maybe you despair of ever
being able to buy a home, have a comfortable retirement, or take a
vacation with your kids. (Are we hitting a nerve?) You’ve probably
just about given up on the American Dream.
Many creditors claim that consumers owe too much because
they’re irresponsible spenders, but recent studies tell a different
story. For example, a 2006 study based on information from the
Federal Reserve Board reveals that U.S. wages have been flat (after
adjustments for inflation) since 2001, while the costs of such basics
as housing, medical care, food, and other household essentials
have increased. In other words, not all U.S. consumers are in debt
because they’re spendthrifts; instead, we’ve all taken a national
pay cut.
Okay, so consumers at all income levels are being stretched to
their limits — including you, which is undoubtedly why you picked
up this book. But chances are that you haven’t yet taken decisive
action to improve your financial situation. Maybe you haven’t even
acknowledged the state of your finances, much less changed your
lifestyle and become more careful about your spending. Even if

you’re well aware that you’re in financial jeopardy, chances are you
don’t know what to do about your situation. You may be frozen by
fear and confusion.
If you’re trying to keep up with your financial obligations but you
feel like poor Sisyphus, struggling to keep the boulder he’s pushing
uphill from rolling over him, you’re in the right chapter. Starting
here, we give you the information you need to take control of your
finances and turn them around.
Taking Stock of Your Finances
You need a clear idea of the current state of your finances in order
to figure out the best way to deal with your debts. Here’s how you
can begin to take stock of your finances (a topic we discuss in
detail in Chapter 2):
 Compare your monthly spending to your monthly income.
Prepare yourself for a shock. Most people underestimate the
amount that they actually spend relative to what they earn. By
doing this comparison, you may quickly realize that you’re
using credit to finance a lifestyle you can’t afford, and you’re
spending your way to the poorhouse. If that’s the case, you
must reduce your spending to meet your financial obligations,
and you may need to do a lot more than that depending on
the seriousness of your financial situation.
 Order copies of your credit histories from the three 
national credit-reporting agencies: Equifax, Experian, and
TransUnion. We provide the contact information in Chapter 2.
Your credit history is a warts-and-all portrait of how you
manage your money: to whom you owe money, how much
you owe, whether you pay your debts on time, whether you
are over your credit limits, and so on. Being charged higher
interest rates on credit cards and loans is a direct consequence
of having a lot of negative information in your credit history.
 Find out your FICO score. Your FICO score, which is derived
from your credit history information, is another measure of
your financial health. These days, many creditors make deci-
sions about you based on this score rather than on the actual
information in your credit history. See Chapter 2 for instruc-
tions on ordering this score.
We understand that things beyond your control — like bad luck
and rising prices — may be partly to blame for your debt. We also
know that chances are you’re at least partly responsible as well.
For example, you may
Part I: Getting a Grip on Your Finances 
10

 Pay too little attention to your finances. You forget to pay your
bills on time; you don’t pay attention to the balance in your
checking account so you bounce checks a lot; and/or you have
a lot of credit accounts.
 Maintain high balances on your credit cards. As a consequence,
you can afford to pay only the minimum due on the cards, you
pay a lot in interest on your credit card debts, and all that debt
has lowered your FICO score.
 Have little (or nothing) in savings so you have to use credit to
pay for every unexpected expense.
 Mismanage your finances because you don’t know how to
manage them correctly.
The National Foundation for Credit Counseling surveyed its
member credit counseling agencies in early 2006 to determine the
key reasons consumers were filing for bankruptcy. The survey
showed that 41 percent of consumers blamed their bankruptcy on
poor money management skills; 34 percent attributed it to lost
income; and 14 percent cited an increase in medical costs.
If compulsive spending is the cause of your financial problems,
get help from an organization like Debtors Anonymous (www.
debtorsanonymous.org) or from a mental health therapist.
Compulsive spending is an addiction just like alcoholism, and
you can’t beat it on your own. You’ll always have debt problems
if you can’t control your spending.
Using a Budget to Get Out of Debt
After you assess the seriousness of your financial situation, you
need to prepare a plan for handling your debt, including keeping
up with your creditor payments — or at least keeping up with
payments to your most important creditors. One of the first things
you should do is prepare a household budget (or spending plan,
as some financial experts euphemistically call it). Whether your
annual household income is $20,000 or $100,000, living on a budget
is probably the single most important thing you can do to get out
of debt and to avoid debt problems down the road.
A budget is nothing more than a written plan for how you intend to
spend your money each month. It helps you
 Make sure that your limited dollars go toward paying your
most important debts and expenses first.
 Avoid spending more than you make.
Chapter 1: The Basics of Managing Too Much Debt 11

 Pay off your debts as quickly as you can.
 Build up your savings.
 Achieve your financial goals.
In Chapter 4, we walk you through the budget-building process
from start to finish.
Reducing your spending and making more money often go hand in
hand with creating a budget. We provide lots of practical sugges-
tions for doing both in Chapter 5.
Getting out of debt usually requires that you change your spending
habits. Because those changes may affect everyone in your family,
if you have children (especially preteens or teens), you and your
spouse or partner should invite them to help you create your
household budget. They can suggest expenses to cut and things
they can do to improve your family’s financial situation. By involv-
ing them, your kids will be less apt to resent the effects of budget
cuts on their lives. Also, you’ll be giving your kids the education
they need to become responsible money managers as adults.
Taking the Right Steps When
You Have Too Much Debt
If you don’t owe a ton of money to your creditors, living on a
budget may be all that it takes for you to whittle down your debts
and hold on to your assets. If you owe a lot, living on a budget is
only the first step in the get-out-of-debt process. You may also
need to do some or all of the following:
 Cut deals with your creditors. Ask your creditors to help you
keep up with your debts by lowering your monthly payments
on a temporary or permanent basis, reducing the interest rate
on your debts, or letting you make interest-only payments for a
limited period of time. Before you approach any of your credi-
tors, you’ve got homework to do. For example, you need to
• Create a list of all your debts and the relevant informa-
tion pertaining to each debt. In Chapter 6, we explain the
specific information to include on your list.
• Review your budget to figure out how much you can
afford to pay on your debts every month, starting with
the ones that are the most important. Don’t allow a cred-
itor to pressure you into agreeing to pay more than you
think you can afford.
Part I: Getting a Grip on Your Finances 
12

Whenever you talk with a creditor, explain why you’re calling
and exactly what you’re asking for. If the first person you
speak with says no to your request, politely end the conversa-
tion and ask to speak with a manager or supervisor.
 Borrow money to pay off debt. When you get new debt in
order to pay off existing debt, the process is called consolidat-
ing debt. We realize that going into debt to get out of debt may
not sound sensible, but if it’s done right, it can be a smart
debt-management strategy. To do it right, however, all the
following should apply when you consolidate:
• The interest rate on the new debt is lower than the rates
on the debts you pay off.
• The monthly amount of the new debt is lower than the
combined monthly total for all the debts you consolidate.
• The new debt has a fixed interest rate.
• You commit to not using credit again until you’ve paid
off the new debt.
In Chapter 7, we explain the various ways to consolidate debt,
including transferring credit card debt to a lower rate card
and getting a bank loan. We also discuss debt consolidation
offers that will do you more harm than good.
 Get help from a credit counseling agency. The advice and
assistance of a credit counseling agency can be a godsend
when you have a lot of debt and are struggling to take control
of it. This kind of agency can especially help when you are
confused about what to do or lack confidence about your
ability to improve your finances on your own. As you find
out in Chapter 8, a credit counseling agency can
• Help you set up a household budget.
• Evaluate a budget you have already created to suggest
changes that will help you get out of debt faster, avoid
the loss of assets, and so on.
• Negotiate lower payments with your creditors and put
you into a debt management plan.
• Improve your money management skills.
Not all credit counseling agencies are on the up and up, so
take time to choose one that is reputable. First and foremost,
that means working with a nonprofit, tax-exempt agency that
charges you little or nothing for its services. In Chapter 8, we
offer a complete rundown of all the criteria to consider when
you are choosing a credit counseling agency.
Also in Chapter 8, we warn you against mistaking a debt settle-
ment firm for a credit counseling agency. If you’re not careful,
Chapter 1: The Basics of Managing Too Much Debt 13

it can be an easy mistake to make because some debt settle-
ment firms try to appear as though they are credit counseling
agencies. However, there are big differences between the two.
The goal of debt settlement firms is to profit off of financially
stressed consumers — not help them improve their finances.
They charge a lot for their services, and many of them don’t
deliver on their promises. Consumers who work with debt set-
tlement firms often end up in worse financial shape than they
were before.
 File for bankruptcy. When you owe too much relative to your
income, your best option sometimes is to file for bankruptcy,
especially if you’re concerned that one of your creditors is
about to take an asset that you own and don’t want to lose.
You can file a Chapter 7 liquidation bankruptcy, which wipes
out most but not all of your debts, or a Chapter 13 reorganiza-
tion bankruptcy, which gives you three to five years to pay
what you owe and may also reduce the amounts of some of
your debts. Throughout this book, we explain how bank-
ruptcy can help you deal with various types of debts.
Handling Debt Collectors
Being contacted by debt collectors can be unnerving, especially if
they try to pressure you into paying more than you think you can
afford by calling you constantly, threatening you, and using other
abusive tactics. Some debt collectors can be so difficult to deal
with that you may promise them just about anything to make them
leave you alone.
Realizing your rights
Debt collectors don’t like taking no for an answer. Most of them are
paid according to how much they collect, and they know from
experience that pushiness pays off. They also know that most con-
sumers are unaware of the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices
Act (FDCPA), which gives them rights when debt collectors contact
them and restricts what debt collectors can do to collect money.
For example, the FDCPA says that you have the right to
 Ask a debt collector for written proof that you owe the debt
he’s trying to collect from you. The debt collector is obligated
to comply with your request.
 Dispute a debt if you do not think that you owe it or if you dis-
agree with the amount. You must put your dispute in writing
and send it to the debt collector within 30 days of being con-
tacted by the debt collector for the first time.
Part I: Getting a Grip on Your Finances 
14

 Write a letter to a debt collector telling him not to contact you
again about a particular debt. After the debt collector receives
your letter, he cannot communicate with you again except to
let you know that he’ll comply with your request or to inform
you of a specific action he’s about to take in order to collect
the money you owe.
The FDCPA also says that a debt collector cannot
 Call you before 8 a.m. or after 9 p.m. unless you indicate that
it’s okay.
 Contact you at work if you tell the collector that your
employer doesn’t want you to be called there.
 Call you constantly during a single day or call you day after
day. That’s harassment!
 Use profane or insulting language when talking to you.
 Threaten you with consequences that are not legal or that the
debt collector has no intention of acting on.
Many states have their own debt collection laws. Sometimes those
laws provide consumers with more protections from debt collec-
tors than the federal law. Contact your state attorney general’s
office to find out if your state has such a law.
If a debt collector violates the law, get in contact with a consumer
law attorney right away. The attorney will advise you of the actions
you may want to take.
We’re not suggesting that you should never deal with a debt collec-
tor. If you agree that you owe a debt, and if your finances allow,
you may want to work out a plan with the debt collector for paying
your debt over time, or the debt collector may agree to let you
settle your debt for less than the full amount you owe.
Understanding why debt collectors
behave like they do
The adage know thy enemy certainly applies to debt collectors.
Understanding why debt collectors behave like they do helps take
some of their power away and empowers you in return.
One of the main reasons debt collectors are so darn persistent
(and can be quite aggressive at times) is money. Most of them are
paid according to the amount of money they collect: The more
they collect, the more they earn; if they collect nothing on your
debt, they get nothing. Other debt collectors actually purchase
Chapter 1: The Basics of Managing Too Much Debt 15

your bad debt from the creditor you originally owed the money to.
These collectors need to recoup the investment they’ve made by
purchasing your past-due debt.
A second explanation for the behavior of debt collectors is one we
address in the previous section: They know that most consumers
don’t have a clue about their legal rights related to debt collection.
Debt collectors are more than willing to push the legal envelope
because experience shows that a lot of consumers will pay at least
a portion of what they owe if collectors harass them enough and
scare them into submission.
There is a third reason for pushy collection practices as well: If the
debt collector’s phone calls and letters don’t get you to pay your
past-due debt, he has to invest additional time and money to take
further action. This situation applies specifically to the collection
of unsecured debts, like credit card debts or unpaid medical bills.
When you acquire an unsecured debt, you don’t have to give the
creditor a lien on one of the assets you own (which would give the
creditor an automatic right to take the asset if you didn’t pay your
debt). If you can’t or don’t pay a past-due unsecured debt, the debt
collector has to sue you for the money, which costs him time and
money. Then if the debt collector wins the lawsuit, he has to try to
collect the money you owe by doing one of the following:
 Seizing one of your assets (assuming you have an asset that
the debt collector can take)
 Having your wages garnished (if your state allows wage
garnishment)
 Placing a lien on one of your assets so you can’t sell it or
borrow against it without paying the debt first
All three options cost the debt collector more time and money. If
your debt is small, the debt collector may decide it’s just not worth
the effort to sue you; his time is better spent going after other con-
sumers with debts that he thinks will be easier to collect. The
same is true if you are judgment proof, meaning that you don’t have
any assets the debt collector can take or put a lien on, you are
unemployed, or your state doesn’t permit wage garnishment.
Paying Special Attention 
to High-Stake Debts
Some debts deserve special attention because the consequences
of falling behind on them are especially serious. For example,
depending on the type of debt, you may risk losing an important
Part I: Getting a Grip on Your Finances 
16

asset, being evicted, having your income tax refunds taken (or
intercepted), and maybe even serving jail time. In later chapters,
we give you detailed guidance regarding how to handle debts such
as the following:
 A mortgage (see Chapter 10)
 A car loan (see Chapter 11)
 Rent or utility bills (see Chapter 12)
 Medical bills and court-ordered child support obligation (see
Chapter 13)
 Federal income taxes (see Chapter 14)
 Federal student loans (see Chapter 15)
Talk with a consumer law attorney as soon as you become con-
cerned about your ability to keep up with payments on a high-
stake debt. The attorney can help you figure out a way to avoid a
default. If you’re already in arrears and being threatened with a
foreclosure, repossession, lawsuit, or some other serious legal
action, run — don’t walk — to the attorney’s office.
Getting a Financial Education
What would you do if you had no debt? Would you buy a new
house? Take a great vacation? Boost your retirement savings?
We’ve got great news: If you follow the steps we outline in this
book, you’ll eventually have to answer that question for yourself
because your debt will disappear and you’ll have money to put
toward your financial goals. Getting from here to there won’t be
easy, but you can do it. If you’re having trouble getting yourself
psyched up for the challenge, take a look at Chapter 3.
To make sure you succeed, we encourage you not only to deal with
your debt head-on but also to become the smartest money man-
ager you can be. After all, when you get to the other side of your
debt problems, you never want to return.
In the sections that follow, we give your financial education a quick
jump-start. To get more details, see Chapters 16 and 17.
Good debt, bad debt: What’s 
the difference?
Considering that you have serious problems with debt, you may be
surprised to hear this: We eventually want you to use credit cards
Chapter 1: The Basics of Managing Too Much Debt 17

and get loans again. Why on earth would we steer you back into
debt when getting out of it is such hard work? Because owing
money to creditors is not necessarily a bad thing.
Whether debt is good or bad depends on why you took on the debt
in the first place and how you manage it — whether you make your
payments on time, for example. It also depends on how much debt
you have relative to your income because too much debt, even if
you’re able to keep up with your payments, harms your credit his-
tory and brings down your credit score (see Chapter 2).
Why debt can be a good thing
Going into debt can be a good thing in many circumstances. For
example, you could go to your grave trying to save up enough
money to purchase a home, so a mortgage is a wonderful thing —
especially if the value of your home grows over time. Also, a home
equity loan is a good financial tool when you use it to improve or
maintain your home (again, with the goal of increasing its value).
A car loan is another example of good debt because most of us
need a vehicle to get to and from work, and most of us can’t afford
to purchase a car for cash. Debt is also good when it helps you
build your wealth; for example, you borrow money to purchase
your home or rental property. Some debt helps you save money in
the long run, like getting a loan to make your home more energy
efficient so you can reduce your energy bills.
When debt isn’t so good
Debt is detrimental to your finances when you run up your credit
card balances in order to live beyond your means or to purchase
goods and services that don’t have any lasting value for you or
your family. For example, restaurant meals, happy hour drinks,
clothing, jewelry, and body care services don’t have any lasting
value, but they sure can run up your credit card balances.
Debt is also a negative thing when you have so much that you can’t
afford to repay it (especially when your home is at risk), when the
amount you owe lowers your credit score, or when you borrow
money from shady operators (like finance companies or payday
loan companies) who charge high interest rates.
Distinguishing between
types of credit
You may think that all credit is created equal. Lots of people think
so, which is one of many reasons they run into debt problems.
In this section, we brief you about various types of credit. They
Part I: Getting a Grip on Your Finances 
18

definitely aren’t created equal, and you should get familiar with
these terms so you can become a better credit consumer.
Here are the types of credit you should be familiar with:
 Secured: With this kind of credit, the creditor guarantees that
it will be paid back by putting a lien on an asset you own. The
lien entitles the creditor to take the asset if you don’t live up
to the terms of your credit agreement. Car loans, mortgages,
and home equity loans are common types of secured credit.
 Unsecured: When your credit is unsecured, you simply give
your word to the creditor that you will repay what you borrow.
Credit card, medical, and utilities bills are all examples of
unsecured credit.
 Revolving: If your credit is revolving, the creditor has
approved you for a set amount — your credit limit — and
you can access the credit whenever you want and as often
as you want. In return, you must pay the creditor at least
a minimum amount on your account’s outstanding balance
each month. Credit cards and home equity lines of credit
are examples of revolving credit.
 Installment: With installment credit, you borrow a certain
amount of money for a set period of time and you repay the
money by making a series of fixed or installment payments.
Examples of installment credit include mortgages, car loans,
and student loans.
We give you the complete credit rundown (not runaround!) in
Chapter 16.
Seeing yourself through 
a creditor’s eyes
To be a savvy consumer, you also need to know the criteria that
creditors use to evaluate you when you apply for new or additional
credit. Although creditors may take other factors into account, fol-
lowing are the three biggies:
 Your character: Does your credit history show that you’ve got
a history of repaying your debts?
 Your financial capacity: Can you afford to repay the money
you want to borrow?
 Your collateral: If you have a poor credit history, or if you are
asking to borrow a lot of money, creditors want to know
whether you have assets that you can use to secure your debt
or guarantee payment on it.
Chapter 1: The Basics of Managing Too Much Debt 19

These criteria not only determine whether a creditor will approve
or deny credit; they also impact how much credit you’re given,
what your interest rate is, and what other terms of credit apply.
See Chapter 16 for details.
Building a better credit history
Right now, when you’re smothered by debt, you may not be able
to think about improving your credit history — you’ve got too
many other immediate concerns. But tuck this topic into the back
of your mind because when you’ve had money troubles, rebuilding
your credit history should be one of your first goals. Having a posi-
tive credit history is essential to getting new credit with attractive
terms. (And as we explain in the section “Good debt, bad debt:
What’s the difference?”, you do want to have access to credit again
down the road.)
The credit rebuilding process, which we walk you through in
Chapter 16, is quite simple: You get small amounts of new credit
and repay the debt on time. For example, you get a MasterCard or
Visa card, use it to purchase some goods or services you need, and
pay off your card balance according to your agreement with the
card issuer. You should also borrow a small amount of money from
a bank and pay off the loan according to the terms of your agree-
ment with the lender.
As you do these things, you add new positive information to your
credit history. Meanwhile, the negative information in your credit
history gradually begins to disappear because, with a few excep-
tions, most damaging credit record information can be reported for
only seven years and six months. As time passes, your credit his-
tory will gradually contain more positive than negative informa-
tion, assuming that you manage your finances responsibly.
Why is rebuilding your credit history so crucial? First, if you have a
negative credit report, you won’t qualify for a credit card with a
low interest rate, and you’ll have trouble borrowing a significant
amount of money from a bank. Here are some other potential con-
sequences of a negative credit history:
 Potential employers who review your credit record as part of
the job application process may not hire you. You could also
be denied a promotion with your current employer if it checks
your credit report as part of the process.
 Life insurance companies may penalize you by charging you a
higher premium or not selling you as much insurance as you
would like.
Part I: Getting a Grip on Your Finances 
20

 Landlords may not want to rent to you.
 You may not be able to get a security clearance or certain
types of professional licenses.
Avoid companies that promise to rebuild your credit or promise to
presto chango make all the negatives in your credit history disap-
pear. Not only are you wasting your money, but (depending on the
tactics a credit repair firm uses) you also may violate federal law if
you do what the firm tells you to do. See Chapter 16 for details.
Using other financial
management basics
As you know all too well, life is full of twists and turns. You may
initiate some of these changes, but others come at you with no
warning. Either way, having a good handle on the basics of money
management helps you keep your finances on track and cope with
the inevitable bumps in the road.
Here are some of the financial basics you should have under your
belt (see Chapter 16 for details):
 Setting and achieving your financial goals. The problem:
There’s a gap between what you’d like to achieve with your
money and the actual money you’ve got available. The solu-
tion: Set (and work methodically toward) financial goals.
Goal setting involves deciding what you want to do with your
money, setting realistic time frames for achieving each goal,
and deciding how you’ll accomplish them. You may decide to
work toward achieving several goals at the same time, or you
may focus all your efforts on attaining one very important and
relatively costly goal, like owning your own home.
 Building a financial safety net. As you start your financial
recovery, one of your first goals should be growing the bal-
ance in your savings account. Having money in savings means
that you can pay cash instead of going into debt for expenses
such as car repairs and home maintenance. The money in
your savings account can also help you weather a job loss.
Financial experts advise that you stash away a minimum of 10
percent of your take-home pay every month.
 Using a budget. Even as your finances improve, don’t throw
away your budget! As we explain in Chapter 4, there is no
better money management tool than a budget. Even if you’re
so successful at conquering your debt that you end up with
Chapter 1: The Basics of Managing Too Much Debt 21

lots of disposable income, we want you to continue to use a
budget to plan your spending and monitor what you actually
do with your money each month.
You’re far more likely to achieve the financial goals you set
for yourself if you build them into your budget than if you just
wing it.
 Being a responsible money manager. As your finances
improve, don’t get sloppy about the way you manage your
money. If you do, you could end up right back where you are
today as you’re reading these words. Avoid backsliding by set-
ting financial goals, having enough money in savings, and living
on a budget. Also, make these truisms part of your daily life:
• Whenever possible, pay with cash, not credit.
• Pay your bills on time.
• Don’t run up your credit card balances.
• Don’t treat your home equity like it’s a piggy bank.
 Becoming a lifelong money learner. The financial manage-
ment guidance we provide in this book is really only the tip
of the iceberg. There is a lot more to uncover, and fortunately,
you’ve got access to countless resources for additional educa-
tion — books, magazines, newspapers, the Web, classes at
your local college, and so on. For a sampling of the possibili-
ties, see Chapter 18.
Being smart with your money requires a lifelong commitment
because the laws that pertain to credit and debt change over
time, as do laws that apply to other aspects of money manage-
ment, such as taxes and investments. Also, as you age, you’ll
have different financial needs and a different relationship with
your money. For example, even if you aren’t thinking about
retirement today, we promise you will someday!
 Relying on professional advice and assistance. No matter
how much you learn about money management, you’re never
going to know as much as financial professionals like CPAs,
financial planners, insurance agents and brokers, and estate-
planning attorneys. At times, you’re going to need the advice
and assistance these pros can give. For example, they can
help you avoid paying too much in taxes, get your retirement
planning on track, save for your child’s college education, pur-
chase the appropriate types and amounts of insurance, avoid
costly money mistakes, and tackle estate planning (Your estate
is simply all the assets you own, regardless of their value.)
In Chapter 17, we explain how each type of financial pro can
help you, and we highlight various resources you can use to
identify the specific advisors you need on your financial team.

Facing Financial Facts
In This Chapter
 Being honest with yourself about your debts
 Examining whether you’ve got an emotional problem with money
 Finding out what your credit reports say
 Figuring out your FICO score
 Comparing your spending to your income
You’ve bought our book, so we assume that means you’re at
least a little worried, maybe really worried, about your debts,
and you’re not sure what to do about them. We seriously doubt
that you’re reading this book just for the fun of it!
Here’s something else we assume: You probably don’t have a good
handle on the true state of your finances. After all, it’s human
nature to try to avoid bad news.
We understand. Facing financial facts can be unsettling and even
scary. Also, when you know the state of your finances, you proba-
bly can’t ignore the fact that improving your financial situation
requires changing your lifestyle and making some big sacrifices.
But no matter how scary it is, confronting the reality of your finan-
cial situation is essential. You have to take that first step before
you can create an effective plan of action for dealing with your
debts. Unless you know where you are, it’s hard to know where you
need to go. And until you come face to face with the facts of your
finances, you may find it impossible to develop the resolve and
self-discipline you need to implement your plan of action.
In this chapter, we guide you through a series of financial fact-
finding exercises. They include answering some questions about
your money situation and how it’s affecting your life, evaluating

your relationship with money, checking out your credit history
information, ordering your FICO credit score, and comparing your
family’s spending to your household income.
The more bad news you get as you complete these exercises, the
more critical it is that you get serious about dealing with your
debts. The sooner you do, the quicker and easier it will be to
improve your finances and the less likely that your creditors will
take some of your assets or that you’ll have to file for bankruptcy.
So let’s get going!
Answering Some Questions
You’ll get a general sense of the severity of your debt problem by
honestly answering the following questions. The more often you
answer ‘yes,” the more you have cause for concern.
 Are you clueless about how much money you owe to your
creditors?
 Over time, is a growing percentage of your household income
going toward paying your debts?
 Do you ever pay your bills late because you don’t have
enough money?
 Have you stopped paying some of your debts?
 Are you paying only the minimum due on some of your credit
cards because you can’t afford to pay more?
 Are you using credit and/or credit card cash advances to help
pay debts and/or your basic living expenses, like groceries,
rent, utilities, and so on?
 Have you maxed out any of your credit cards, or have any of
your cards been cancelled for nonpayment?
 Do you have little or nothing in savings?
 Have you borrowed money from friends or relatives to pay
your bills?
 Have debt collectors begun calling you, and/or are you receiv-
ing threatening notices from some of your creditors?
 Are you having a hard time concentrating at work because
you are worried about money?
 Are you losing sleep because of your finances?
 Have you and your spouse or partner begun fighting about
money?
Part I: Getting a Grip on Your Finances 
24

 Are you drinking more or using illegal drugs in order to try to
cope with your money worries?
 Are you an overspender? Answering the 15 questions at the
Debtors Anonymous Web site can help you decide. According
to the site, most compulsive spenders answer yes to at least 8
of the 15 questions. Go to www.debtorsanonymous.org and
click on “Take a Debt Quiz.”
Evaluating Your Relationship
with Money
Some serious soul-searching is in order if you’re worried about
how much you owe to your creditors. If you are really honest with
yourself, you may conclude that you are the reason you’ve got a
debt problem. Here are two good books that can help you honestly
evaluate your relationship with money and change the way you
think about it:
 Your Money or Your Life: Transforming Your Relationship with
Money and Achieving Financial Independence (Penguin) by Joe
Dominguez and Vicki Robin. This personal finance classic
helps you evaluate the role that money plays in your life,
reorder your priorities, and live on what you make.
 The Financial Wisdom of Ebenezer Scrooge: 5 Principles to
Transform Your Relationship with Money by Ted Klontz, Rick
Kahler, and Brad Klontz (Hci Publishing). This book combines
quotes from Charles Dickens’s A Christmas Carol, real stories
of people with money problems, and the authors’ own advice
to help you figure out how your attitudes about money affect
your life and to help you change destructive patterns.
Equating stuff with success
You may have the misconception that you are what you buy, which
means the more you spend, the more successful and important you
are. It’s easy to develop that mindset because we are bombarded
with messages that equate money and stuff with success. How often
do you see ads promoting frugality, saving, or self-denial?
If you’re hanging with a fast set and struggling to keep up, it may
be time to reevaluate your friendships. Trying to keep up with the
Joneses may be driving you into the poor house.
Chapter 2: Facing Financial Facts 25

Recognizing emotional spending
Maybe you spend money for emotional reasons. For example, think
about what you do when you feel sad or disappointed, or when you
want to celebrate a success. Do you head to the mall or click on
your favorite retail Web site? Do you treat yourself to an expensive
meal or enjoy a weekend getaway even though you really can’t
afford it?
If this describes your behavior, you need to get a handle on why
you’re overspending. Meet with a mental health professional; you
may qualify for help from a low-cost/no-cost clinic in your area.
Or get involved with Debtors Anonymous (DA). DA uses the time-
tested methods of Alcoholics Anonymous to help people under-
stand why they spend and to gain control over their spending. To
find a DA chapter in your area, go to www.debtorsanonymous.org,
or call 781-453-2743.
Living for the moment
Maybe your problem is that you live for today and don’t think
about tomorrow. In some ways, living in the moment is great, but
not if you turn a blind eye toward your future. How do you know if
you’ve got this attitude toward money? You probably
 Use credit too much.
 Don’t try to pay off your credit balances as quickly as possible,
using the rationale that there will be plenty of time to do that
later.
 Save little, if anything.
 Rarely if ever take time to balance your checkbook and check
out your credit reports and credit score, much less develop
and use a household budget.
These money attitudes are self-destructive, and they do catch up
with you eventually. Since you’re reading this book, they probably
already have.
Checking Out Your Credit Reports
There are three national credit reporting companies: Equifax,
Experian, and TransUnion. Reviewing the information in your credit
report from each is an excellent way to get a clear picture of how
you fare financially.
Part I: Getting a Grip on Your Finances 
26

Getting copies of your credit reports
For a comprehensive picture of your creditworthiness, order a
copy of your credit report from each of the national credit report-
ing agencies, not just from one. Each report may contain slightly
different information about you, in part because all creditors do
not necessarily report all consumer account payment information
to each of the three agencies.
You are entitled to one free copy of each of your credit reports
every 12 months. To order your free reports, go to www.annual
creditreport.com, or call 877-FACT-ACT.
If you’ve already obtained copies of your free credit reports during
a particular 12-month period, you must pay a fee to order addi-
tional copies. In most states, the cost will be $10 per report. (Some
states also charge a sales tax.) However, depending on your state,
you may be entitled to pay less for additional copies of your credit
reports. Call your state attorney general’s office to find out.
Also, you are always entitled to a free credit report if
 You are unemployed and intend to apply for a job within the
next 60 days.
 You are receiving public welfare assistance.
 You believe that you have been the victim of identity theft.
 You have been denied credit, employment, insurance, or a
place to rent within the past 60 days because of information in
your credit report.
To order additional copies of your credit reports after you’ve
obtained your free annual credit reports, you must contact each of
the three credit reporting agencies individually. You can order the
copies via the mail, by phone, or online. Here’s the ordering infor-
mation you need:
 Equifax: www.equifax.com; 800-685-1111; Disclosure
Department, P.O. Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374
 Experian: www.experian.com; 888-397-3742; P.O. Box 2104,
Allen, Texas 75013
 TransUnion: www.transunion.com; 800-888-4213; P.O. Box
1000, Chester, PA 19022
Chapter 2: Facing Financial Facts 27

If you order additional copies by mail, put your request in a letter
that includes the following information, and be sure to sign your
letter:
 Your full name (including Jr., Sr., III, and so on)
 Your Social Security number
 Your date of birth
 Your current address and previous addresses for the past
five years
 Your phone number, including area code
 The name of your current employer
Knowing why your reports matter
The credit report you get contains the very same information that
your current creditors and potential future creditors review to make
decisions about you. The more negative information that is con-
tained in your credit histories (such as past-due accounts, accounts
in collection, accounts that your creditors have charged off as uncol-
lectible, tax liens, and so on), the worse your finances are.
Your existing creditors may use the information to decide if they
will raise the interest rates you are paying, lower your credit limits,
or even cancel your credit. And whenever you apply for new
credit, the creditors review your credit record information to
decide whether to approve your application, how much credit to
give to you, the interest rate you must pay, and so on.
Many insurance companies, landlords, and employers also review
your credit record information to make decisions about you. If they
find a lot of negative information, insurance companies may not
agree to insure you or may charge you higher than normal premi-
ums; landlords may refuse to rent to you; and employers may not
want to hire you or to give you the promotion you applied for.
Most negative information remains in your credit reports for seven
years and six months. A Chapter 7 liquidation bankruptcy and a
Chapter 13 reorganization of debt will linger for ten years. A tax
lien will stick around until you pay it.

For more detailed information about credit reporting, including
advice on understanding your credit reports and correcting prob-
lems in them, pick up a copy of Credit Repair Kit For Dummies by
Steve Bucci (Wiley).
Finding Out Your FICO score
A growing number of creditors, as well as insurance companies,
employers, and landlords, use your credit score together with (or
rather than) your credit history to make decisions about you. Your
credit score is a numeric representation of your credit-worthiness,
and the number is derived from your credit history information.
Like your credit history, the score is a snapshot of how you’ve
managed credit in the past, and it is generally considered to be an
indicator of how well you are likely to manage credit in the future.
There are a variety of different credit scores. For example, Equifax,
Experian, and TransUnion have each developed their own credit
scores. (Each credit-reporting agency sells its credit score on its
own Web site.) But the FICO score has become the industry stan-
dard. You can order your FICO score by going to www.myfico.com.
Your FICO score will range from 300 to 850. The higher your score,
the better: A score of at least 720 is considered to be very good.
If your score is well below 720, you may still qualify for credit from
some creditors, but you’ll be charged a higher interest rate, and
you may not qualify for as much credit as you would like. Likewise,
insurance companies may be willing to sell you insurance, but
you’ll probably pay extra for the coverage, and you may not be
able to purchase as much insurance as you would like. And when
you have a low FICO score, some landlords will not rent to you,
and you may not qualify for certain kinds of jobs, especially those
that involve handling money.
You can raise your FICO score by improving the state of your
finances. For example, your credit score will go up if you
 Pay down your account balances.
 Begin paying your debts on time.
 Build up your savings.
 Minimize the amount of credit you apply for.
 Correct problems in your credit histories.
Chapter 2: Facing Financial Facts 29

Comparing Your Spending
to Your Income
Now comes the real measure of the state of your finances: Figuring
out how your total spending compares to your total household
income. You may be in for a shock. Are you ready?
Gathering the necessary materials
To complete this exercise, you need a pad of paper, a pen or pencil,
and a calculator. You also need the following financial information:
 Check registers
 Bank statements
 Receipts for major purchases not made with a credit card
 Credit card account statements
 Other expense records for the past 12 months
You also need records of your income for the past 12 months, such
as pay stubs and deposit slips or direct deposit information. If
you’re self-employed, you need your business records.
Your spouse or partner should gather up the same information
because the goal of this exercise is to give you as complete a pic-
ture as possible of how your household spending compares to your
household income.
Categorizing your expenses
Create a worksheet modeled after the one at the end of this chap-
ter. Doing so will help you organize your spending and income
information and make sure that you don’t overlook anything. (This
worksheet will also come in handy if you read Chapter 4, where we
help you build a budget.)
The worksheet divides your spending into three categories:
 Fixed expenses: These are expenses that stay the same from
month to month. Examples include your rent or mortgage, car
loan, home equity loan, and insurance.
Part I: Getting a Grip on Your Finances 
30

 Variable expenses: These types of expenses tend to vary from
month to month. Examples include groceries, gas, utilities,
restaurant meals, movies, CDs, books, and so on.
 Periodic expenses: These kinds of expenses may be fixed or
variable. The difference is that you pay them just once in a
while, such as quarterly, every six months, or annually. Tuition,
some insurance premiums, property taxes, and dues are
common examples of periodic expenses.
Some of the expenses listed as fixed spending on the worksheet
may actually be periodic expenses for you. For example, instead of
paying your auto insurance every month, you may pay it every
quarter.
After you’ve calculated total annual amounts for each of your
debts and for all your living expenses, transfer those dollar
amounts to the appropriate lines on your worksheet.
Figuring out the fritter factor
It’s easy to fritter money away: a latte here, a happy hour drink or
two there, lunch out with the girls, some new clothes. Before you
know it, it’s the end of the month and you don’t have any money
left in your checking account. Where did it all go? Most likely, you
unconsciously frittered it away on unnecessary, miscellaneous
items. Each purchase may not have cost much, but together over a
month’s time, they add up to a significant amount.
For example, let’s assume that every workday you spend $3 on a
latte. In a month, you spend $60, and in a year that tiny daily pur-
chase adds up to $720! If you also spend $2.50 per day for a bagel
or pastry to go with the latte, you’re spending $110 each month
and more than $1,300 per year!
To help you get a handle on how much you fritter away, for one
month we want you to write down everything you purchase with
cash, a debit card, or a credit card. Your spouse or partner should
do the same. Carry a small notebook with you whenever you leave
the house so you can record every expenditure right away instead
of trying to remember it later.
After the month is up, add up everything you spent on nonessential
items. We bet you’ll be surprised to see how much it amounts to.
Multiply this number by 12, and put that number in your work-
sheet under “Other” in the “Variable Spending” section.
Chapter 2: Facing Financial Facts 31

Totaling spending and earnings
Add up the numbers in each of the three spending categories to
get a subtotal for each category. Then add up the subtotals. The
final number represents the amount you are currently spending
each year.
Next, add up all the income you received during the same 12-month
period. Take into account not just your net household income
(which is your take-home pay: your gross income minus all deduc-
tions), but also any other income you or your spouse or partner
may receive: government benefits, investments, royalties, child
support or spousal support, income from a family business, and
so on. Record that total on your worksheet too.
If you are entitled to receive child support and/or spousal support
but the payments rarely come, don’t include those amounts when
you calculate a total annual income number for your household. If
it’s unreliable income, you can’t count on it to help cover your
spending.
Calculating your financial
bottom line
After you have a total annual income amount and a total annual
spending amount, subtract your spending total from your income
total.
If the final number you calculate is negative, that means the
amount you are spending is more than your annual household
income. You may be financing your lifestyle by using credit cards
and cash advances, and/or you may be falling behind on some of
your obligations. Furthermore, you may not be paying some of
your bills at all, which means that if you add the amount of those
bills into your calculations, you have an even bigger deficit.
If you ended up with a positive number, your finances may be in
better shape than you think. Or not. If the number is small, you
may be just barely staying ahead. And if your bottom line is posi-
tive only because you’re paying just the minimum due on your
credit cards each month or because you’ve stopped paying some
of your debts, you have no cause for celebration. If this describes
your situation, you are treading water at best, and a financial set-
back like a job loss or an expensive illness could be financially
devastating.

Adopting an Attitude
for Success
In This Chapter
 Thinking positively
 Dealing with disappointments
 Making your family part of the solution
G
etting out of debt can be no fun! We’re the first to admit it
because we’ve been there. Like countless other people, we’ve
had our share of money troubles over the years, so we understand
what a drag it is to pinch pennies, give up the things you enjoy, and
work harder than ever. We’ve also counseled people whose finances
were in such bad shape that getting out of debt meant having to take
other steps like consolidating their debts, negotiating with their
creditors, and even giving up some of their assets.
It can be daunting to owe a bundle to your creditors and to be faced
with the change and sacrifices that are necessary to turn your
finances around. Success may require every ounce of determination
and self-discipline you can muster. It also requires that you be able
to maintain a can-do attitude — a get-out-of-debt attitude — over a
sustained period of time because your finances are probably going
to improve gradually, not overnight.
In this chapter, we help you develop the right thinking for the chal-
lenges ahead. We tell you how to overcome self-doubt and set your
mind to the job, and we provide advice and encouragement for
staying the course despite any setbacks and disappointments you
may encounter along the road to financial health. We also offer sug-
gestions for alleviating the stress you may experience as a result of
your get-out of-debt efforts. In addition, we explain the value of
involving your family in those efforts. We provide specific advice
for keeping the lines of communication open between you and
your spouse or partner and for helping your kids cope.

Believing in Yourself
A positive, I-can-get-out-of-debt attitude is key to turning your
finances around. You have to believe that you’ve got what it takes.
Here are some proven strategies for helping you believe in yourself
and set your resolve:
 Draw strength from tough challenges you’ve faced in the
past. Maybe someone in your family had a serious illness, you
went through a divorce, a close relative or friend died, or you
experienced a major disappointment in your career. Think
about what you did to get through those tough times. Use the
memories to remind yourself of your strengths and abilities.
 If you believe that you’re largely responsible for your
family’s financial problems, don’t beat yourself up about
what you did or didn’t do. You can’t change what happened,
and letting feelings of self-recrimination and guilt bog you
down makes it a lot harder to do what you need to do now.
Benefit from your mistakes and move on. When negative
thoughts come into your head, try to let them go.
A negative attitude can be contagious. If you act bummed out
all the time about your family’s financial situation, your bad
attitude is likely to spread to everyone else in your house-
hold. Don’t forget that your kids are observing how you
behave in the face of adversity, so set a good example.
 Remember that you’re not the only person who has ever
experienced financial problems. Millions of people have
been where you are and have had to do what you must now
do to get out of debt. If they can do it, so can you!
 Get inspired by reading a book or watching a TV documen-
tary about someone who had to overcome something diffi-
cult. These types of stories are plentiful, but if you need some
suggestions, consider FDR, Nelson Mandela, Helen Keller, or
Stephen Hawking.
 Motivate yourself by visualizing your future. Close your eyes
and think about what life will be like when you don’t have a
lot of debt, you’re not stressed out about money all the time,
you’ve got a comfortable balance in your savings account,
and you and your family can afford a few extras.
 Don’t stay silent about your money troubles. You don’t need
to shout it from the rooftops, but let your close friends and
family members know that you are going through some finan-
cially tough times, even if you have to swallow your pride and
admit some mistakes. You may need their support and
encouragement. If you’ve kept your financial problems a
Part I: Getting a Grip on Your Finances 
38

secret until now, telling people about them can take a huge
load off your shoulders. And you just may discover that your
friends or relatives have been in similar situations.
If some of your friends or family members are experiencing
money problems, create your own support group. Get together
regularly to share ideas about getting out of debt, to give one
another encouragement, and to celebrate your successes.
 Boost your self-confidence by getting smarter about money.
Enroll in a basic personal finance class; read a good book on
the subject, like Personal Finance For Dummies, 4th Edition, by
Eric Tyson, MBA (Wiley); or make regular visits to personal
finance Web sites like www.bankrate.com for practical infor-
mation about all aspects of everyday money management.
 Be realistic about how long getting out of debt will take. Don’t
expect to pay off your high-interest debts, build your savings
account, and have extra money in your pocket by next week.
Depending on the specifics of your finances, tackling your debt
could take months or years. As long as you’re serious about
dealing with your debts, you’ll see gradual improvement in your
finances, but there’s no quick fix for serious money problems.
 Rethink your definition of success. It’s easy to get caught up
in the idea that success means spending a lot of money. After
all, the more stuff you have, the happier you’ll be, right?
That’s certainly what credit card companies and advertisers
want you to believe! But there are other ways to define suc-
cess: being a good parent, spouse, and friend; helping the less
fortunate; living an ethical life; making a difference in your
community; and so on. Money can’t buy any of these things,
yet all of them can bring you profound and lasting happiness.
 Stop making excuses. Maybe you hear yourself saying, “Yes,
but I don’t have time to find cheaper insurance.” “Yes, but
living on a budget is too much work.” Yes, but I can’t earn
more money right now.” You can make the necessary changes
in your life. You can’t afford to make excuses.
Handling Setbacks
When you begin down the path toward financial health, you may get
off course occasionally. If you do, don’t beat yourself up. Instead,
refocus, steel your resolve to do better from now on, and move
forward.
Okay, that’s great advice, but is it realistic? Negative thinking can
creep up on any of us, making it seem impossible to move forward.
Maybe you’re tired of living on a budget, having to say no to your
Chapter 3: Adopting an Attitude for Success 39

kids, and working all the time. Maybe you’ve been hit with a finan-
cial setback like a creditor who refuses to negotiate with you or the
loss of an asset you wanted to hold on to. Of course you’re going to
feel blue once in a while. What can you do about it? Lots.
 Celebrate each get-out-of-debt success. At a minimum, take
time to acknowledge what you’ve achieved. Maybe you got one
of your creditors to agree to lower the interest you are paying,
or you landed a part-time job that will allow you to pay off
your debts faster. Celebrating your successes, no matter how
small, can help motivate you to keep moving forward.
 Stay active. Exercise is a great way to get rid of stress, frustra-
tion, and negative thoughts. So when you’re feeling down,
don’t plop yourself in front of the TV. Go for a run or walk,
take a bike ride, swim, or play your favorite sport.
 Find things to laugh about. Rent a funny movie, spend time
with a witty friend, watch your favorite sitcom, read the funny
papers, or check out a jokes and humor Web site like the one at
http://swcbc.org/humor. A good belly laugh is therapeutic.
 Do something fun. There are plenty of ways to have fun on
the cheap. Read a good book, play board games, do puzzles
with your kids, go for hikes, dig in the garden, invite friends
over for a potluck meal, rent a movie, enjoy your local park,
visit a museum, and so on.
 Count your blessings. Draw strength from the good things in
your life. Volunteering (maybe at a food bank or homeless
shelter) is an excellent way to get rid of a “poor me” attitude
and to keep your situation in perspective.
 Accept what you can’t change. If your financial problems are
the result of things you had no control over (maybe you lost
your job in a downsizing or had a bad accident that landed
you in the hospital), railing against your fate is a waste of
time. Accept what happened and move on. Say the Serenity
Prayer used by Alcoholics Anonymous and other self-help
organizations: “God grant me the serenity to accept the things
I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and
the wisdom to know the difference.”
 Find peace through prayer or meditation. Whether it’s a
church or synagogue, your house, or the beach, find a quiet
place where you can recharge your spirit regularly. Use prayer
or meditation to detach yourself from the negatives going
on in your life. Tell yourself, “All this will pass.” And it will,
eventually.

If you’re experiencing more than the occasional blues — if you can’t
shake your negative feelings — you may be depressed. Depression
will sap your energy and make it difficult, if not impossible, to move
forward (see the “Signs of depression” sidebar). Get help by sched-
uling an appointment with a mental health professional. We can
hear you saying, “But I can’t afford that!” Your local chapter of the
Mental Health Association is a good resource for finding the help
you need at an affordable price. To locate the chapter nearest you,
go to www.nmha.org/infoctr/FAQs/treatment.cfm. This site also
provides contact information for other mental health resources you
or someone in your family may need.

Signs of depression
Depression can be a debilitating disease, but in most cases it’s also very treatable.
If, after reading the following list of symptoms, you suspect that you may be
depressed, schedule an appointment with a mental health therapist right away.
Keep in mind that you don’t have to have all these symptoms to be diagnosed as
depressed.
The signs of depression include
 Feeling sad all the time.
 Feeling worthless, hopeless, and/or guilty for no rational reason.
 Constant anxiety and/or irritability.
 Lethargy.
 Loss of interest in the activities you used to enjoy.
 A change in your sleep patterns: You want to sleep all the time, you are having
trouble falling asleep, or you’re not getting a full night’s sleep.
 Difficulty concentrating and making decisions.
 A lot of headaches or stomachaches.
 Loss of interest in eating or a need to overeat.
 Using alcohol and/or illegal drugs to avoid reality.
 Constantly thinking about death or even suicide. If you have these thoughts, get
help immediately. The crisis hotline of the National Strategy for Suicide
Prevention is a good resource: Call 800-273-8255. It will connect you immedi-
ately to someone with your local suicide crisis center who can help you deal
with your feelings.

Asking for Help
You may find that you need more than pure willpower and resolve
(coupled with the information in a good book like this) to help you
handle your debt problems. If you are having trouble committing
to a get-out-of-debt program and staying focused, or if you can’t
shake feelings of discouragement and hopelessness about your
finances, take advantage of these resources:
 Debtors Anonymous (DA): Drawing on the time-tested princi-
ples and approach of Alcoholics Anonymous, DA chapters
around the country help consumers with spending problems.
DA meetings are free and open to anyone. Hearing other DA
members talk about their own struggles and successes can be
inspiring. And having a sponsor — someone to call when you
feel discouraged or want to spend money that you shouldn’t —
can help you stay in control of your life and get out of debt. To
find a DA chapter near you, use your local Yellow Pages, go
to the organization’s Web site (www.debtorsanonymous.org),
or call the organization at 781-453-2743.
 Mental health professionals: Individual or group therapy can
be invaluable when emotional problems are getting in the way
of your get-out-of-debt efforts. If you have medical insurance
but it doesn’t cover mental health therapy, or if you don’t
have insurance, find out about low-cost/no-cost mental health
resources in your area. A good place to start is the Web site
of the National Mental Health Association, www.nmha.org/
infoctr/FAQs/treatment.cfm.
 Other books about money and your relationship with it:
Reading books like Your Money or Your Life: Transforming Your
Relationship with Money and Achieving Financial Independence
(Penguin Books) by Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin and Mary
Hunt’s Debt-Proof Living: The Complete Guide to Living
Financially Free (Broadman & Holman Publishers) by Mary
Hunt, a recovering credit card addict, can help you rethink
your attitude toward spending and debt. They can also help
you live a life that is simpler, more personally rewarding, and
less focused on spending money.
 Your friends and family: Don’t let pride and embarrassment
keep you from letting the people closest to you know that
you’re having financial trouble. You’ll isolate yourself when you
are most in need of their moral support and encouragement.

Making Your Family Members
Your Financial Allies
If you’re the primary money manager in your family, you will prob-
ably shoulder most of the responsibility for turning your family’s
finances around. However, that does not mean you shouldn’t
involve the rest of your family in the effort. The cooperation of
your spouse or partner is essential. Although you may pay the bills
each month, you and your spouse or partner both spend your
family’s money, so he or she has a very direct effect on the success
or failure of your get-out-of-debt program.
You should also be honest about your family’s finances with your
children. They don’t need to know all the details, but if your chil-
dren are old enough to sense money-related tension and anxiety in
your household, you need to tell them what is going on and what
you are doing to improve things.
Pulling together with 
your spouse or partner
The support and cooperation of your spouse or partner is essen-
tial to getting your family’s finances back on track. One of you can’t
be pinching pennies while the other is spending like there is no
tomorrow. Both of you should be totally committed to getting out
of debt and not using credit.
If you and your spouse or partner have trouble talking calmly about
your family’s financial problems and what to do about them, avoid
letting your conversations degenerate into arguments. You may find
that talking about money is easier in a public place, such as a coffee
shop or a park. If a change of venue doesn’t improve your commu-
nication, consider scheduling an appointment with a marriage
counselor or religious advisor so you can get at the root problems.
When you talk with your spouse or partner about your debts, try
to stay focused on solutions to your financial problems instead of
letting the conversation turn into a blame game. Both of you are
probably responsible for your debts to some degree, and finger-
pointing won’t pay the bills.
Chapter 3: Adopting an Attitude for Success 43

But keep in mind that no matter how hard you try to cooperate with
one another, money problems create a lot of stress in a relationship.
We can’t offer easy solutions for getting through the tough times
ahead. We can only encourage you to work hard at keeping your
relationship amicable.
If your spouse or partner is unwilling to work with you to help your
family get out of debt, and if you are concerned that his or her
spending will condemn you to a life of financial troubles, you may
want to reevaluate your relationship. Although ending your relation-
ship at the same time you are trying to resolve your family’s finan-
cial problems won’t be easy, you may conclude that it’s best. If you
are thinking about divorce, our book Divorce For Dummies (Wiley)
explains how to prepare emotionally and financially for that process.
Talking money with your children
If you’re like a lot of parents, your initial instinct may be to protect
your children from your family’s financial problems. Usually, that’s
not a good thing. Even very young children are amazingly percep-
tive about negative changes in their environment. They may not
know exactly how things have changed or why, but they can sense
the change and may develop problems as a result unless you help
your kids understand and deal with what is going on.
Help your children maintain a sense of security by explaining your
family’s financial situation and what they can expect in the months
ahead. Take their ages and maturity levels into consideration when
you decide what to say and how to say it. Tell them as much as you
think they need to know and can process intellectually, and be
careful not to scare them.
You probably need to go into greater detail with a preteen or
teenage child than you do with a younger child. Teen and preteen
kids generally have more financial needs and wants than young
children and are more subject to peer pressure, so they need a
clear sense of how they may be affected by your efforts to get out
of debt. For example, they may have to start bringing their lunches
to school, or you may need them to get part-time jobs to help pay
for their gas, auto insurance, or nonessentials.
Compared to your younger kids, your preteens and teenagers are
most apt to have difficulty accepting the fact that they can’t do and
have all the things they have become used to. Peer pressure can be
a powerful thing!
Part I: Getting a Grip on Your Finances 
44

Regardless of the age of your children, reassure them that things
may be different for a while, but you love them and everything will
be okay. Help them feel safe by letting them know that you and
your spouse or partner are putting a financial turnaround plan
together, by keeping their day-to-day routines as unchanged as
possible, and by doing fun things together.
Be alert to signs that your family’s financial problems are creating
a lot of stress in your children’s lives or that they are becoming
depressed. Signs of trouble include crying, angry outbursts, with-
drawal, behavior problems at school, headaches, stomachaches,
not wanting to go to school . . . just about anything out of the ordi-
nary. Try to get your kids to talk about what is bothering them. If
they won’t, or if their symptoms get worse, they probably need to
meet with a mental health professional. Contact the psychologist
at their school, and consider letting their teachers know what is
going on so they can look for signs of trouble as well.
As you help your children cope with your family’s financial circum-
stances, bear in mind that your money troubles offer you an oppor-
tunity to teach them important lessons about managing money and
the dangers of too much debt. When they become adults, they may
be able to use those lessons to avoid financial trouble. One good
way to help them master these lessons is to involve them in creat-
ing a monthly household budget. We talk about budgeting and the
role your children can play in that process in Chapter 4.

Building a Budget

 Distinguishing between high- and low-priority financial obligations
 Reviewing a budget surplus
 Making your budget work month to month
W
e know. You hate the idea of a household budget. However,
it’s a basic money management tool for getting out and
staying out of debt. So if you’re serious about improving the state
of your finances and avoiding future problems, you need to lose
your anti-budget bias.
A budget is nothing more than a written plan for how you intend to
spend your money each month, how much you’ll contribute to sav-
ings and retirement, and so on. A budget helps you live within your
means. When you’re drowning in debt, it’s your financial life raft.
In this chapter, we show you how to create a monthly household
budget and how to monitor your compliance with it from month to
month. If you can’t afford to pay all your obligations in a certain
month, we tell you which debts to pay and which to put off. We
also warn you against using certain types of loans to generate
extra cash.
Over time, if you stick to your budget and follow the rest of the
advice in this book, your financial situation will improve. But even
after your financial outlook is rosier, you should continue to
manage your money by using a budget. Otherwise, you may get
careless about your spending or begin using credit too much, and
the amount of your debt may begin creeping up to dangerous
levels again.

Living on a budget will also make it easier for you to
 Build up your savings so you have money to fall back on if you
are hit with a big unexpected expense, lose your job, or have
to take a pay cut.
 Purchase big-ticket items with minimal use of credit.
 Help make your family’s financial dreams come true — a new
home, a great vacation, college educations for your kids, a
comfortable retirement.
The benefits of living on a budget are huge, so let’s get started
creating one for your household.
Comparing Your Monthly
Spending and Income
Creating a monthly budget for your household is not a complicated
process, but it can be time consuming. Simply stated, here’s what
you need to do:
 Compare your current total monthly spending to your current
total monthly income.
 Reduce your spending as necessary so it’s less than your
income.
 Allocate your dollars appropriately so you are able to pay all
your living expenses and debts.
In Chapter 2, we ask you to compare your annual spending to your
annual income in order to get a fix on the state of your finances. If
you have not already completed that exercise, now’s the time to do
it; that information will be essential to the budgeting process in
this chapter. Don’t worry, we’ll wait for you!
After you’ve completed that exercise, take these steps:
1. Divide each of the annual dollar amounts on the Chapter
2 worksheet by 12 in order to come up with monthly
amounts.
2. Make copies of the spending and income worksheet at
the end of this chapter (so you can use the worksheet
multiple times).
3. Record each monthly amount in the appropriate place on
the worksheet.
Part II: Going on a Debt Diet 
50

4. Review the dollar amounts and adjust them up or down
as necessary so they are as accurate as possible. For
example, the cost of your auto insurance may be about to
increase, your child’s tuition is going to go up next month,
or your income is going to go down.
If your annual totals don’t include living expenses and
debts that you should be paying but aren’t because you
don’t have enough money, be sure to add them to your
annual totals before you divide by 12. For budget-building
purposes, you must have an accurate picture of all your
living expenses and debts.
5. Subtract your total monthly spending from your total
monthly income. Record that amount on the worksheet. It
will be either a positive or a negative number.
Tackling a Budget Deficit
If the bottom-line number on your worksheet is negative, you’ve got
a budget deficit. You may be making up the difference between your
Chapter 4: Building a Budget 51
Making budgeting a family affair
As we discuss in Chapter 3, developing a budget and making it work is something
that you and your spouse or partner should do together. After all, you’re both spend-
ing your family’s money. It’s a good idea to involve your kids in the process too.
Sit down as a family and talk about why your family needs to live on a budget and
what budgeting involves. Show your kids the income and expense worksheets you
fill out as you work your way through the budgeting process. Share your current
income and spending figures with them, let them know how much less your family
needs to spend each month, and ask your kids for budget-cutting ideas, including
things they are willing to give up. Also, discuss any budget cuts you plan to make
that will directly affect them.
At the end of each month, sit down as a family and compare your budgeted spend-
ing to your actual spending. Celebrate if your family’s spending is in line with its
budget by doing something inexpensive together — maybe ice-cream cones for all
or a picnic in the park. When your comparison shows that your family spent more
than was budgeted, talk about why you went over budget and what all of you can
do to ensure that it doesn’t happen again.
When your children feel like an important part of your family’s financial team and
understand that you value their input, they will be more apt to pull with you, not
against you. Also, they’ll be less apt to resent changes that may affect them.

total monthly income and your total monthly spending by using
credit cards, getting credit card advances, borrowing money, writing
hot checks, paying bills late, or not paying them at all. Stop doing
those things! They’re driving you deeper and deeper into debt.
Cutting expenses
Deal with your budget shortfall instead by reducing your spending.
Review your budget, looking for expenses you can cut back or
eliminate. Focus first on your discretionary spending because
those are nonessential items. You’ll find most of your discretionary
spending items in the “Variable Spending” category on your work-
sheet; however, some of your fixed and periodic spending items
may also be discretionary. For example, cable is not an essential
expense, you may be able to find a less expensive Internet provider
than the one you now use (or go to the library when you need to
get onto the Internet), and maybe you can cancel some of your
memberships.
If your deficit is small and most of it is due to waste and fluff, you
may be able to move your budget into the black just by eliminating
nonessentials. But you may not be that lucky. Instead, you may
have to go through several rounds of budget cutting and do some
serious belt-tightening before your household’s total monthly
spending is less than its total monthly income. Use your worksheet
to calculate the impact of each round of cuts on your budget’s
bottom line.
If you need spending reduction suggestions, check out our ideas in
Chapter 5.
Focusing on reducing debt
rather than saving
If you are still contributing to savings and/or a retirement plan, stop
doing that for now. Use that money to cover your living expenses
and pay down your high interest debts. Why? The money in your
savings and retirement accounts earns only a few percentage points
of interest each month — most likely far less than the interest rates
on your debts. Therefore, when you have debt, every month you
pay more in interest than you can earn in interest on your savings.
When your financial situation improves, you can start contributing
to savings and retirement again. For now, you must put every
penny you have toward your essential living expenses and toward
paying down your high interest debts.
Part II: Going on a Debt Diet 
52

Using other strategies
Moving your budget from red to black may require more than
budget cutting alone. The same is true if you can afford to pay only
the minimum due on your high interest debts. When you pay just
the minimum each month, it takes months if not years to pay off
those debts, and you pay hundreds of dollars in interest — dollars
that you could put to better use.
Other get-out-of-debt strategies you may need to consider include
 Increasing your household income: Get a second job, turn
your hobby into a part-time business, or let your boss know
that you would like to work more hours. If your spouse or
partner is not working outside the home, discuss whether a
paying job makes sense — at least until your finances
improve. In Chapter 5, we review your moneymaking options.
 Negotiating with your creditors: Some of them may be willing
to lower your monthly payments or make other changes to
help you afford to continue paying on your debts. In Chapter 6,
we explain how to negotiate with your creditors.
 Consolidating your debts: Debt consolidation involves bor-
rowing money to pay off high interest debt and to lower the
total amount you pay on your debts each month. We explain
how debt consolidation works and your consolidation options
in Chapter 7.
 Getting help from a reputable nonprofit credit counseling
agency: The agency can help you develop your budget and
may also suggest setting up a debt management plan. In
Chapter 8, we explain how credit counseling works and how
to find a good credit counseling agency.
 Filing for bankruptcy: Bankruptcy should always be your
option of last resort. When may it become your best option?
• If you’re about to lose an important asset
• If your monthly expenses are so much higher than your
income that it will take years of sacrifice and barebones
budgeting before your debts are manageable and you
have a little extra money left over each month
After reviewing your financial information, a bankruptcy attor-
ney can tell you whether you should file for bankruptcy and
which type of bankruptcy to file: a Chapter 13 reorganization,
which gives you three to five years to pay your debts; or a
Chapter 7 liquidation, which wipes out most of your debts.

bankruptcy process, read Personal Bankruptcy Laws For
Dummies by James P. Caher and John M. Caher (Wiley).

Paying the Important Stuff If
You Can’t Pay Everything
If you’ve cut your budget to the bare bones and you still can’t
afford to pay all your debts and cover all your living expenses,
you have to decide what you will and won’t pay. Here’s how to
prioritize:
Part II: Going on a Debt Diet 
54
Gauging your finances by using
standard percentages
Financial experts agree that in general each of your basic living expenses, as well
as the total amount of debt you owe (secured and unsecured), should equal no more
than a certain percentage of your net household income. (Net household income is
your income after deductions for taxes and other expenses; it’s your take-home pay.)
When you’re developing your budget, one way to pinpoint expenses that need
reducing is to compare your numbers to the standard percentages below. After you
have a budget, you can also use the standard percentages to monitor the state of
your finances over time.
If your percentages are a little higher than the ones on the following list, you don’t
necessarily have cause for concern because certain expenses may be higher in
your part of the country. Housing, for example, varies greatly from place to place.
Also, some financial books and Web sites may use slightly different percentages
than the ones below. There is no one correct set of figures. These are just approx-
imate amounts for you to use as spending guidelines:
 Your monthly housing expense: 25 percent of your net household income (35
percent if you take into account homeowner’s insurance, property taxes, home
maintenance, and repairs)
 Consumer debt (credit cards, student loans, medical debts, and so on): 10 per-
cent of your net household income
 Utilities: 15 percent of your net household income
 Transportation: 15 percent of your net household income
 Savings: At least 10 percent of your net household income
 Everything else (food, clothing, medical insurance, prescriptions, entertain-
ment, and so on): 25 percent of your net household income

 Essential living expenses: Your essential living expenses
belong at the top of your “Bills to Pay” list, including putting
bread on your table, keeping a roof over your head, keeping
your utilities on, and gassing up your car if you need it to earn
a living. However, make sure that you have reduced those
expenses as much as you possibly can.
 Secured debts: Your secured debts also belong at the top of
the list of things to pay. Keep reading if you aren’t sure what a
secured debt is.
 Certain unsecured debts: Some of your unsecured debts
should take priority over others. We go into detail in the upcom-
ing section “Knowing when to prioritize an unsecured debt.”
Distinguishing between secured
and unsecured debt
A secured debt is a debt that you collateralized with an asset that
you own. (The asset is often referred to as your collateral.) When
you collateralize a debt, the lender puts a lien on that asset, which
gives the lender the legal right to take the asset if you fall behind
on your payments. For example, if you have a mortgage loan, your
lender has a lien on your home. If you have a car loan, the lender
has a lien on your vehicle.
A lot of your debt, like credit card debt, is probably unsecured,
which means that the creditors do not have liens on any of your
assets. If you don’t pay an unsecured debt, the creditor will try to
get you to pay up. If you don’t, the creditor may bring a debt collec-
tor on board to try to get your money. If you still don’t pay, the
creditor must sue you to get the court’s permission to try to collect
what you owe. The creditor can ask the court for permission to
 Seize one of your assets
 Put a lien on an asset so you can’t borrow against it or sell it
without paying your debt
 Garnish your wages (taking a portion of them each pay
period), assuming wage garnishment is legal in your state

an unsecured debt
Depending on your circumstances, certain unsecured debts should
be treated as top priorities given the potential consequences of not

paying them. Unsecured debts that deserve priority treatment
include
 Child support, especially if it’s court ordered. In Chapter 13,
we provide advice for what to do if you’ve fallen behind on
your payments, and we warn you about the potential conse-
quences of not making them.
 Federal income taxes. Uncle Sam has almost unlimited
powers to collect past-due tax debts. In Chapter 14, we review
those powers and explain what to do if you fall behind on
your taxes.
 State income taxes. If you don’t pay these taxes, your state
can sue you, garnish your wages, or seize your property.
 Property taxes and homeowner’s insurance, if these expenses
aren’t included in your mortgage payments. When you don’t
pay your property taxes, the taxing authority will eventually
take your home. If your homeowner’s insurance gets cancelled
for nonpayment, your lender will buy insurance for you, but the
insurance will be very expensive, so the total amount of your
monthly mortgage payments will increase.
 Federal student loans. The IRS can collect what you owe
when you fall behind on your federally guaranteed student
loans. In Chapter 15, we offer advice about how to avoid
defaulting on your student loans.
 Your health insurance, if you’re responsible for the pay-
ments. Keeping up with your health insurance is especially
important if you or a family member has an ongoing health
problem. Without insurance, an expensive illness or accident
could push you into bankruptcy.
 Medical bills. A growing number of healthcare providers,
including hospitals, are getting very aggressive about collect-
ing on their patients’ past-due accounts, even suing patients
in some instances. If you owe money to a healthcare provider,
contact the provider to try to work out a plan for paying what
you owe.
If one of your unsecured creditors turns your debt over to a debt
collector, no matter how much the debt collector may hound and
threaten you, do not give in to the collector’s demands if paying
the unsecured debt means you can’t pay your priority debts or
living expenses. In Chapter 9, we tell you how to deal with debt
collectors.

56

Examining a Budget Surplus
If your monthly spending and income comparison shows that you
have money left over each month, you still may not have cause for
celebration. For example, you may have a surplus because you’re
not paying some of your bills or you’re meeting some of your obli-
gations by using credit cards. If this is the case, you must still
reduce your spending so your income covers all your bills and
living expenses each month.
A key aspect of getting out of debt is not using your credit cards.
We certainly understand that sometimes you may have to use a
credit card to pay for a financial emergency if you have no extra
money in your budget and nothing in savings. But you should
resolve to pay off the amount you charge as quickly as possible:
the next month, if possible. And you should try not to charge any-
thing more until you’ve wiped out the new credit card debt.
You may also have a surplus because you’re paying only the mini-
mum due on your outstanding credit cards balances each month.
You’ll never get out of debt that way! If you have any surplus in
your budget, use it to accelerate the rate at which you pay off the
balances, starting with the highest rate card.
Even if you can cover your monthly obligations without using
credit cards and while paying more than the minimum due on
your card balances, don’t assume that you shouldn’t reduce your
spending. You must be concerned about how much you owe to
your creditors, or you probably wouldn’t be reading this book. Cut
back where you can, and use that additional money to pay off your
debts as fast as you can, starting with the debt that has the highest
interest rate. After you’ve paid off that one, focus on paying off the
debt with the next highest rate of interest, and so on. When you’ve
paid down your high interest debts, start building up your savings.
Finalizing and Sticking
to Your Budget
After you’ve reduced your spending as much as you can and
decided what you will and won’t pay if you can’t afford to pay
everything, it’s time to finalize your household budget. Make a
fresh copy of the worksheet at the end of this chapter. Label the
new worksheet “Monthly Household Budget,” and record your
revised monthly spending amounts, as well as your monthly
Chapter 4: Building a Budget 57

income amounts. Now you have a written plan for what you’re
going to do with your money each month.
Review the budget with your family members, and post it in a visi-
ble location so everyone can see it — maybe on a bulletin board in
your kitchen or family room or on the front of your refrigerator.
Steeling your resolve
Now comes the hard part: living according to your budget. There
is no sense in having a budget if you and your family are not going
to stick to it. Sticking to your budget won’t be easy, but keep your
eye on the prize: less financial stress, fewer debts, less damage to
your credit history, and (eventually) more money to spend the
way you want.

Leave these loans alone
If you don’t have enough money to pay all your living expenses and debts, do not
raise the money you need by getting one of the following types of loans. Although
they may give you some temporary financial relief, in the end they’ll make things
worse — maybe a lot worse. When it comes to improving your finances, there are
no easy answers or shortcuts. You’ve just got to bear down and do it.
 Advance fee loan: Just as its name implies, to get this kind of loan you must pay
money upfront to the lender — sometimes as much as several hundred dollars.
Some advance fee lenders will take your money and run, but others will give
you a very high interest loan. Traditional lenders do not make advance fee loans.
 Finance company loan: Finance companies make relatively small, high interest
loans. Some finance company loans are downright dangerous: The lender may
be less than honest about all the fees associated with its loan; or it may mis-
lead you into thinking that you’re getting an unsecured loan when in fact the
loan is secured by one or more of your household goods, such as your furni-
ture, entertainment center, and so on. (This detail is usually buried in the fine
print of the loan agreement.) If you default on the loan, you risk losing the
asset(s). Some finance companies encourage consumers to get a bigger loan
than the consumers can afford so they’ll end up in default.
 Payday loan: This is a very short-term, high interest loan made by check cashing
companies, some finance companies, and businesses that do nothing but make
payday loans. To get this loan, you write a personal check to the lender for the

Chapter 4: Building a Budget 59
amount of money you want to borrow plus the amount of the lender’s fee —
usually a percentage of the loan amount or a set amount for every $50 or $100 you
borrow — and you agree to repay the loan on your next payday. The lender pays
you the amount of the check less its fee but does not cash your check.
On your next payday when you repay the loan, you get the check back. If you
can’t repay the loan on the next payday, the lender rolls over the loan until the
following payday in exchange for you paying the lender another fee, which will
probably be higher than the first fee. Over time, if you keep rolling over the loan
and paying higher and higher fees, the cost of the loan skyrockets, and you have
a harder and harder time paying it off.
Some states have payday loan laws. Contact a consumer law attorney or your
state attorney general’s office to find out if your state has such a law and what
your rights are.
 Pawnshop loan: This is a short-term loan (no more than three months in most
states) with a very high interest rate. Here’s how this kind of loan works: You
give the pawnshop an item that you own, like a TV, DVD player, piece of jew-
elry, or computer. The pawnshop lends you a percentage of the item’s value. At
the end of the loan period, if you cannot afford to pay the loan plus interest, the
pawnshop keeps your item and sells it.
 Tax refund loan: Also known as a tax anticipation loan or an instant refund loan,
this kind of loan involves borrowing against your future IRS tax refund. Some
tax preparers, as well as finance companies, car lenders, retailers, and check
cashing companies, make this kind of loan. Usually the loan will be for no more
than $5,000, and it will last for no more than ten days. In addition to having to
pay a very high rate of interest on the loan, you must also pay the lender an
upfront fee, and you must file your tax return electronically to the tune of about
$40. So when you consider the loan’s interest rate plus the fees involved, the
effective rate of interest you pay to borrow against your own money may be in
the triple digits. When the IRS issues your tax refund, it deposits the money
directly into an account set up by the lender, who takes its money and gives you
the rest.
 Car title loan: If you own your car free and clear, some lenders will make you a
loan for a small fraction of what your car is worth. Usually the loan will be for
no more than 30 days and will have a very high rate of interest. To get the loan,
you must give the lender the title to your vehicle and a set of car keys. The major
danger with this kind of loan is that if you miss a loan payment, you risk the loss
of your car. Depending on the loan agreement, all it may take is one missed
payment.

As you go through each month, be mindful of every dollar you
spend, every check you write, and every time you use your debit
card or go to an ATM machine. Refer to your budget regularly to
make sure you are staying on track. If you find that you have over-
spent in one area, try to compensate by reducing your spending in
another area.
If your kids ask for things that you’ve not budgeted for, remind
them why your family is trying to spend less. If they are older,
maybe they can earn the money they need for what they want.
As we suggest in Chapter 2, carry a small notebook or some other
small record-keeping device with you for writing down everything
you purchase with cash, debit card, or credit card each day. Keep
all your receipts as well. You need this information at the end of
each month when it’s time to evaluate how well you are doing.
Checking your progress each month
To live on a budget, each month you must compare your actual
monthly spending to what you budgeted. Here’s how:
1. On your monthly budget, add a column to the right of
each dollar amount that’s labeled “Actual.”
2. Compile all your spending records for the month (check
registers, bank statements, receipts, the information in
your spending notebook) and all your income records to
figure out your actual expense and income numbers.
3. Record these amounts in the appropriate places in the
“Actual” column of your budget for the month.
4. Calculate subtotals and grand totals for the month.
If you spent more than you budgeted on something, or if your total
spending exceeded what you budgeted, try to figure out why you
spent more. Here are some possible explanations:
 You overlooked a living expense or debt when you devel-
oped your budget.
 Your budget isn’t realistic. It’s too bare bones, so it’s impossi-
ble for you and your family to live on it.
Part II: Going on a Debt Diet 
60

 Your family did not try hard enough to live according to
your budget. Making a budget work takes a 100 percent com-
mitment from everyone in your household.
 You were hit with an unexpected expense that month. For
example, you were working late at the office, so your childcare
expenses increased, or your car broke down and you had to
spend money getting it fixed.
 Some of your expenses increased for reasons beyond your
control. The cost of gas went up or your insurance premium
increased, for example.
 Your income dropped. Maybe you had to take a cut in pay,
your sales commissions were lower than usual, or a client did
not pay you that month.
Depending on your conclusions, you may need to revise some of
the numbers in your household budget. If you have to increase the
amount of an expense, try to decrease another expense by the
same amount. If you have to revise your budget to reflect a
decrease in your household’s monthly income, try to offset the
decrease with budget cuts as well.
If your monthly comparison shows that some of your expenses were
lower than what you budgeted, don’t revise your budget right away.
Wait a month or two to see if the changes are permanent. If they are,
put the extra money toward your high interest debts, focusing first
on paying off the debt with the highest rate of interest. Do the same
if your income increases permanently.
Your budget is a dynamic document that should change as your
finances change, hopefully for the better. Gradually, if you stick to
your budget, you’ll start paying off your debts faster. Eventually,
you’ll also be able to add some extras to your budget (maybe some
of the things you’ve had to give up for now) and start contributing
to savings so you’ll have a financial safety net. If you continue to be
careful about your spending and to minimize your use of credit,
before you know it, you family will be in a position to make its
financial dreams come true.

Chapter 5
Slashing Your Spending and
Making More Money
In This Chapter
 Cutting back on housing costs, utilities, food, and more
 Boosting your household income
W
hen your monthly expenses are greater than your income,
you must rein in your spending and stop using your credit
cards. The same is true if you’re just barely getting by each month,
if you’re paying only the minimum due on your credit cards, or if
you have little or nothing in savings.
Finding ways to increase your family’s income may also be essen-
tial, especially if you’ve cut your budget to the bare bones and
you’re still sliding backwards, just treading water, or paying for
every unexpected expense with a credit card. Working at another
job or working more hours at your current job are two options you
may want to consider.
This chapter provides you with practical suggestions for reducing
your spending and boosting your income. Although every idea in
this chapter won’t apply to you, the advice we offer here may help
trigger other ideas that make sense for your particular situation.
Finding Ways to Spend Less
In this section, we offer a treasure trove of ideas for spending less,
organized by category of everyday expense: housing, utilities,
food, transportation, healthcare, and so on. Some of the ideas are
small and simple but yield big benefits over time, especially when
done in combination with other money-saving suggestions.

Don’t reject any cost-cutting ideas right off the bat, even if imple-
menting them means major changes in your lifestyle and a lot of
sacrifice. Be open to anything and everything, and try to focus less
on what you’re giving up and more on where spending less will
help get you in the end.
After you give up a few “essentials,” you may discover that you
don’t even miss them. You may find that not having them actually
improves your quality of life. For example, using public transporta-
tion to get to and from work gives you time to read, think, and
maybe even relax. And cutting out some activities that have filled
your kids’ after-school hours and weekends may open up new
opportunities for and your kids to interact.
Looking for good deals
Before we tackle specific areas of your household budget, we have
a couple tips for getting the most out of your money no matter
what you’re buying.
First is a Web site that should be on your list of favorites: www.
yokel.com. Whether you’re in the market for a prom dress, a car,
a DVD player, or a new refrigerator, you can locate the best deals
in your area by going to this site.
Next is a piece of advice about advertising: Although you should
always try to buy things when they’re on sale, you shouldn’t buy
an item just because it’s discounted. Instead, make purchases
based on whether you truly need an item. If you scour the Sunday
ad flyers in your newspaper looking for good deals, you’re bound
to be tempted to buy things you don’t really need. Keep this in
mind: That item that looks like such a good deal today may get
marked down even more in a week or two.
If you can’t resist a sale, you may have a spending problem. People
with spending problems tend to buy for the sake of buying, even
when they know they shouldn’t. Spending makes them feel good at
the time but lousy later. Even so, they spend again. If you think you
may have a spending problem, don’t be embarrassed. Get help
from other overspenders by going to a Debtors Anonymous (DA)
meeting in your area. To find a DA chapter in your area, go to
www.debtorsanonymous.org or call 781-453-2743.
Spending less on your housing
Housing is probably the single biggest item in your budget, espe-
cially if you are a homeowner and you take into account the cost of
Part II: Going on a Debt Diet 
66

maintenance, repairs, insurance, and taxes. You can rein in your
housing costs in many ways.
 Renters: Following are some options to consider if you’re
renting:
• If you’re close to the end of your lease, find a cheaper
place to live. If you’ve got time left on your lease, read
your lease agreement to find out how much it costs to
break it so you can move out early.
• Move in with your parents or other relatives while you
work on improving your finances.
• Stay where you are but get a roommate if your lease
allows.
Read Chapter 12 for more information about breaking your
lease or adding a roommate.
 Homeowners: If you own your home, consider the following
possibilities:
• Look into mortgage refinancing to lower your monthly
payments. Be careful, however, about refinancing with a
mortgage that may create problems for you down the
road, like an interest-only mortgage or one with a big
balloon payment at the end. If you are confused about
whether a particular mortgage is good or bad for your
finances, talk to a financial advisor, a nonprofit credit
counseling agency, or a real estate attorney.
• Rent out an extra room in your home.
• Lease your home to someone else and move into
cheaper digs. Make sure the rent you charge covers
your mortgage payments plus the cost of your home-
owner’s insurance, property taxes, and routine mainte-
nance and repairs.
• Sell your home. We know this may be a lot to ask, but if
you’re paying for more house than you can truly afford,
getting out from under the debt is a good thing.
Lowering your utility bills
The cost of heating and cooling a home always seems to go up, up,
up. Add in the cost of water, wastewater, and lights, and you may
find yourself gasping when you open your utility bills each month.
Here are some suggestions for bringing down these costs:
 Use your heat and air conditioning less by keeping your home
cooler in the winter and warmer in the summer. Keep your
Chapter 5: Slashing Your Spending and Making More Money 67

thermostat set at 68 degrees in the winter and at no less than
78 degrees in the summer.
 Lower the temperature on your water heater, but not to less
than 120 degrees.
 Ask if your local utility company offers free energy audits.
You’ll find out where your house is losing energy and what
you can do to make your home more energy efficient. The
utility may also offer rebate programs that can lower the cost
of your energy improvements, or you may qualify for a low-
interest/no-interest home energy loan to finance expensive
improvements like installing a more energy-efficient heating
and cooling system.
 Find out if your utility offers an energy saving program. For
example, some power companies automatically shut off your
household appliances during peak use hours each day.
 Replace your commode with one that uses less water. Also,
replace old showerheads with new, low-flow heads.
 Make your home more energy efficient by caulking, using
weather stripping, and adding insulation, all of which are rela-
tively easy do-it-yourself projects.
 Use fans, not AC, to cool your home.
 Hang up your clothes to dry. Not only is using a dryer expen-
sive, but all that hot air makes your clothes wear out faster.
 If you have to replace your washing machine, get one that
loads from the front rather than the top. You’ll reduce your
energy use by as much as 50 percent and save on water too.
 Take showers, not baths, and limit the length of your showers.
 Replace old-fashioned light bulbs with the new ultra-efficient
fluorescent bulbs.
 Never run a dishwasher that is only half-full of dishes.
 Fix leaky faucets.
Eating for less
One of the easiest expenses to reduce is the amount you spend on
food. Reducing your grocery bill may mean eating more homemade
foods and less prepackaged items, which has some added bonuses:
You’ll be eating healthier, and you’ll probably shed a pound or two!
 Plan out your meals for the coming week based on your
budget, and go to the grocery store with a list of the items you
need. Buy them and nothing more.
Part II: Going on a Debt Diet 
68

 Minimize your trips to the grocery store. The more trips you
make, the more you are apt to spend. Also, never shop when
you are hungry. You’re more apt to load your cart up with
items you really don’t need.
 When you make a meal, double the recipe and store the extra
half in your freezer. When you have to work late one night or
are feeling frazzled after a difficult day at the office, you’ll be
less tempted to purchase prepared food or carryout on your
way home because you have a meal waiting that you can just
pop into the microwave.
 Clip coupons and read the grocery store inserts in your local
newspaper for good deals on items you plan on buying.
Coupon Web sites like www.couponcabin.com, www.coupon-
craze.com, and www.coolcoupons.com offer savings at spe-
cific stores and on popular national brands. Some offer free
product samples too.
 Shop at several different grocery stores. Some may offer
better deals on certain items that you use.
 Purchase house brands.
 Minimize your use of prepared foods and convenience items.
You pay a premium for them.
 If you drink regularly, drink less and buy less expensive wine,
beer, or hard liquor.
 Purchase groceries at warehouse stores, discount houses, and
buying clubs. When practical, buy in bulk.
Don’t buy perishable items in large quantities unless you are
sure you will use them up before they spoil. Also, don’t buy
items in bulk or on sale that you’re not sure your family will
use; they’re only good deals if you actually use them!
 Pack lunches for yourself and your family.
 Make your own morning coffee instead of buying it on your
way to work.
 Eliminate sodas and junk food from your diet.
 Reserve dining out for special occasions only.
 Celebrate a special occasion with a picnic rather than with a
restaurant meal.
 Pop your own popcorn for the movies. Old-fashioned home-
made popcorn tastes a whole lot better than the prepopped
stuff available at most movie theaters, and it’s a lot cheaper too.
 When your family goes on a day trip, pack your meal instead
of eating at a restaurant.
Chapter 5: Slashing Your Spending and Making More Money 69

 Grow your own vegetables and herbs. If you don’t have a
green thumb or if you lack the space for a garden, buy your
fruits and veggies at your local farmers’ market.
Paying less for transportation
After the cost of housing, the cost of getting from here to there may
be your second biggest monthly expense. You may already have
found ways to trim your transportation budget since the cost of a
tank of gas has been rising, but you may find some new ideas here.
 Use public transportation, ride your bike, walk, or carpool to
work if possible. If you use public transportation or carpool,
you may be able to read and enjoy the passing scenery. If you
ride your bike or walk, you may even lose a few pounds.
 Shop around for the best deal on gas. Driving a little farther to
fill up your tank for less may be worth the extra miles and time.
 If your vehicle is a gas guzzler or expensive to maintain, con-
sider selling it and purchasing a reliable, less expensive used
vehicle.
 Change your own oil, and do your own simple car repairs. Your
local community college or an adult education program in your
area may offer a class in basic car maintenance, or maybe a
neighbor or friend can show you the basics. Also, the “Car Talk”
guys on National Public Radio feature a humorous but down-to-
earth do-it-yourself guide to car repair and maintenance at their
show’s Web site, www.cartalk.com/content/diy.
 Pump your own gas, and wash your own car. Also, don’t buy a
higher grade gas than your car really needs.
 Find a reliable mechanic who won’t charge you an arm and a
leg every time you bring your vehicle to the repair shop. Ask
people you know, especially people who drive cars similar
to yours, for the names of good mechanics. A shade tree
mechanic — someone who maintains and repairs cars in his
backyard — may provide affordable, high quality service.
Avoid having your car repaired by a dealer or at a chain car
repair shop.
The experts on the “Car Talk” radio show maintain a “humon-
gous database of over 16,000 great mechanics, recommended
by — and for — the Car Talk community.” Access their
Mechanics File by going to www.cartalk.com/content/mechx.
 Ask your teenagers to pay for their own gasoline and auto
insurance or to help contribute to the cost.

Having fun for less
Reducing your budget does not mean that you and your family
have to eliminate fun from your lives. It means cutting out the frills
and taking time to find affordable ways to have a good time. Think
back to when you were just married and money was tight or to
when you were a kid. What did you do for fun then? Do any of
these cheap fun suggestions sound familiar?
 Use your public library instead of buying books and DVDs, or
swap these items with your friends.
 Go to www.zunafish.com and exchange your used books,
CDs, DVDs, and video games with others online for a buck a
trade. As the Web site says, “Trade the stuff you’re done with
for the stuff you want!”
 Commune with nature. Go for a hike, ride your bike, have a
picnic in the park, go fishing, enjoy the babble of a swift run-
ning creek, and take time to enjoy the sunset.
 Have fun the old-fashioned way: Put jigsaw puzzles together,
play card and board games, do crossword puzzles, play cha-
rades, create a scrapbook, or put all your photos in an album.
 Use your community pool.
 Take advantage of free events in your community.
Chapter 5: Slashing Your Spending and Making More Money 71
Just how much do your vices cost?
There may be a silver lining in your cash crunch if you are a regular smoker or
drinker. Not having the money you need to pay your creditors and cover your basic
living expenses may convince you that it’s time to become a nonsmoker or to give
up that glass or two (or three) of wine you sip at the end of each day, or that six pack
of beer you throw back each evening.
Let’s assume, for example, that you and your spouse or partner enjoy a $15 bottle of
wine with dinner each night. In a week’s time, your nightly bottle of wine costs you
$105. That’s $402 a month and nearly $5,000 a year! Now that’s a lot of money to
spend on the fruit of the vine!! Just think what you could do with that money instead.
Now, let’s look at how much you’re spending to smoke. Let’s assume that you smoke
half a pack of cigarettes every day, and you pay $5 for each pack. More than $900
of your money is going up in smoke each year, which doesn’t even take into account
how much extra you’re paying for life insurance because of your unhealthy habit.
If you give the habit up, you can reduce the cost of your premium by as much as 30
percent. You’ll probably pay less for health insurance as well.

 Entertain with potluck meals.
 Invite your friends over for a backyard barbeque with a twist:
Everyone brings something to throw on the grill.
 Curl up with a good book.
 Use two-for-one-coupons or share an entrée with your dinner
companion when you want to dine out.
 Trade babysitting services with friends or relatives who
also have young children so going out occasionally is more
affordable.
Looking good for less
When you are rolling in dough, you can afford to spend a bundle on
salons, spas, personal trainers, and so on. But those are all luxu-
ries you can’t afford right now. They gotta go! Here are suggestions
for keeping yourself and your family looking good for less:
 Do your own manicures and pedicures, or get together with a
girlfriend and do them for each other.
 Cut and color your own hair, get it cut and colored less fre-
quently, or look in your Yellow Pages or on the Web for a
beauty school in your area. Most beauty schools offer free or
low-cost cuts and coloring so students can hone their skills
while being supervised by experienced professionals.
 Cut your family members’ hair.
 Get a massage at a massage school in your area. Find one in
your local Yellow Pages, or go to www.naturalhealers.com.
 Eliminate expensive cosmetics, creams, and lotions. Although
the packaging may not be as attractive as the high priced stuff,
drug store cosmetics, creams, and lotions usually do the job.
 Minimize your use of dry cleaning, and wash and iron your
own shirts, blouses, and pants. If you hate ironing, watch TV
or listen to music while you work out those wrinkles.
 If you belong to a health club and your membership is about
to expire, find a less expensive alternative or — if you rarely
go to the club — cancel your membership. Your local YMCA
or community center may be more affordable options.
 Speaking of health, give up those glasses of wine or bottles of
beer you drink every night. Not only do they cost you money
(see the sidebar “Just how much do your vices cost?”), but
they also increase the number of calories you consume each
day and jeopardize your health if you’re a problem drinker.

Dressing for less
With a little planning and ingenuity, you and the rest of your family
members can look like fashion plates without paying top dollar.
The key is to plan ahead, eliminate impulse buying, and maybe
rethink where you shop. Here are some suggestions for how to
look like a million dollars on the cheap:
 Shop for clothes only when you truly need them, not for fun
or out of boredom.
 At the end of each season, take an inventory of the clothing
items you need to replace because they are worn out or
because your kids have outgrown them. Then take advantage
of end-of-season sales.
 Check out thrift shops, nearly new stores, and yard sales.
You’re likely to find some great deals.
 Buy on sale whenever possible, and shop at discount stores
like T.J. Maxx, Target, Marshalls, and Kohl’s.
 If you have young children, make their clothes last longer by
buying them a little big. Then roll up the sleeves and pants
bottoms, and shorten the hems on skirts and dresses.
 Swap clothes with friends or family members.
 If you’ve got the time and the skills, make some of your own
clothes.
Reducing your phone costs
Over the past decade or so, the amount of money you spend to
stay in touch has probably increased. Cellphones are ubiquitous,
and phone companies offer a plethora of extras that are nice but
unnecessary. Therefore, reducing the amount that you spend on
your phone service each month may not be much of a challenge,
and those reductions should have little or no real impact on your
lifestyle. Here are some suggestions for staying in touch for less:
 Shop around for the best deal on phone service. If you’re in
the market for a cell phone and service plan, Web sites like
www.letstalk.com and www.myrateplan.com can help you
home in on your best options.
 Cancel your landline and go with Internet-based phone serv-
ice through your cable company or a company like Vonage,
SunRocket, or Skype. Typically, you pay a flat fee of about $25
for unlimited domestic calls. However, most of these compa-
nies require that you have high-speed Internet access, and
Chapter 5: Slashing Your Spending and Making More Money 73

you may need to purchase a headset, so before you ditch your
landline put pencil to paper to be sure you’ll save money.
 Make sure that your calling plan matches the way you use
your phone. For example, if you make a lot of in-state calls,
your calling plan should have a low intrastate rate, and if you
frequently call out of state, be sure your plan offers low inter-
state rates. Some plans allow unlimited long distance calling
on weekends, in the evenings, or 24/7. Call your service
provider to make sure that your plan fits your needs.
 Consider a family plan for your cell phone service if multiple
people in your household have wireless phones. Also, ask
your teens to pay for the cost of having a cell phone.
 Get rid of your landline, if you have a cell phone with an
unlimited calling plan.
 Review the extras you’re paying for like voice mail, call waiting,
caller ID, call forwarding, and so on. Do you really need them?
 Minimize your use of directory assistance.
Saving on prescription drugs
If the cost of prescription drugs is taking a big bite out of your
budget, don’t do without the drugs you need. Follow some of this
advice for reducing what you pay for your pills:
 Ask your doctor for free samples whenever he prescribes a
prescription drug for you or someone in your family.
 Ask your doctor if there is a generic alternative to the drug
he prescribes, or whether he can prescribe a less expensive
alternative. Many newer drugs are more expensive than their
older equivalents, but they are not necessarily better.
 Buy 90-day supplies of the drugs you take regularly in order to
save on the dispensing fee that many pharmacies charge each
time they fill a prescription.
 Talk with your doctor about prescribing a higher dose of the
pill you normally take, and use a pill splitter to split it in half.
You pay for fewer refills this way. However, your doctor
should have the final say on whether this is a good option for
your particular medication.
 Shop around before you get a prescription filled. You may be
surprised at the range in prices from drugstore to drugstore.
 Purchase your prescription drugs from an online pharmacy —
one licensed by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy
through its VIPPS program. (The VIPPS seal of approval will be
Part II: Going on a Debt Diet 
74

prominently displayed on the site.) Go to the association’s Web
site at www.nabp.net for a list of the online pharmacies it has
licensed. Reputable online pharmacies include www.costco.
com, www.drugstore.com, and www.familymeds.com.
 Buy in bulk, from a mail-order pharmacy, medications that
you take regularly.
 Find out if you qualify for a drug assistance program. Some
programs are income based, but others, like Merck’s, offer
prescription drug discounts to consumers who are uninsured
regardless of their incomes. Partnership for Prescription
Assistance at www.pparx.org offers an online databank of
drug assistance programs.
Drug discount cards tend to be bad deals, in part because they
have so many restrictions. For example, you may not be able to
use your card to buy generic drugs or drugs online, or you may be
able to use it only at certain pharmacies.
Inching down your insurance costs
Maintaining your insurance coverage is essential even when you
need to cut back. Without it, a serious illness, a car accident, or
flood or wind damage to your home could be financially devastat-
ing and push you into bankruptcy.
Shop around for the best deal on your insurance. An insurance
broker can help you, or you can explore your options by using a
Web site like www.insure.com. For example, you may be able to
get less expensive coverage by switching to another provider, by
raising your deductibles (the amount of money you have to pay out
of pocket before your insurance company starts to pay) on your
current policies, or by getting rid of any insurance bells and whis-
tles you really don’t need.
Also, make sure that you are getting all the insurance discounts
you’re entitled to. For example, you may be entitled to a discount if
you don’t commute to work in your car, if you take a class to
refresh your driving skills and knowledge, if you purchase your
home and auto insurance from the same company, if you’re over
65, if you install certain safety features in your home, and so on.
Homeowners insurance
Following are specific tips for reducing your home insurance costs:
 When you insure your home, don’t count the value of the land
your home sits on. Insure the structure only.
Chapter 5: Slashing Your Spending and Making More Money 75

 Find out if you’ll save money by installing deadbolt locks and
smoke detectors. If your home already has a security system,
make sure it’s reflected in your policy.
 If someone in your family was a smoker but has kicked the
habit, find out if your insurance company will lower your pre-
mium costs. Households with smokers often pay a premium
for insurance because burning cigarettes are a leading cause
of house fires.
Auto insurance
Consider the following ways you may trim your auto insurance bill:
 If your vehicle is old and not worth very much, drop your col-
lision coverage, especially if you’re spending more on the
coverage than your car is worth. Another option is to increase
the deductible amounts for your collision and comprehensive
coverage.

Blogs that can help you make
every penny count
Blogs can be a great way to find out what other people in your same financial straits
are doing to cut back and live on a budget. They can also provide you with moral
support and encouragement. Here are a few of the blogs we think are worth a visit:
 The Budgeting Babe (www.budgetingbabe.blogspot.com). This blog
claims that it’s dedicated to “all of the young working women who want to spend
like Carrie in a Jimmy Choo store, but have a budget close to Roseanne . . .”
 Everybody Loves Your Money, (www.everybodylovesyourmoney.com).
The author of this blog grew up in a family where money was tight.
 The Frugal Duchess (www.sharonhr.blogspot.com). A Miami Herald per-
sonal finance columnist who claims that she has “fine tastes and a small
budget” writes this blog.
 Frugal for Life (www.frugalforlife.blogspot.com). This blog is all
about living a simple, frugal life.
 Savvy Saver (www.savvysaver.blogspot.com). This blog is dedicated to
“making smart money decisions, living below your means, and increasing per-
sonal wealth.”
 Spending Wisely (www.spendingwisely.com). For thoughts and musings
on spending, saving, and simple living, check out this blog.
 Stop Buying Crap (www.stopbuyingcrap.com). The goal of this blog is to
help people stop wasting money.

 Be sure that you are getting all the discounts you may be enti-
tled to, such as discounts for
• Driving a car with antilock brakes, automatic seat belts,
and airbags.
• Being in a particular profession. Statistics show that
people in certain types of professions — engineers and
teachers, for example — tend to have fewer accidents.
• Your military service. Some insurance companies give
you a break on the cost of your insurance if you are cur-
rently in the military or if you used to be.
 If you have to purchase a new car, buy one like your granny
might drive. High profile/high performance cars cost more to
insure.
 Find out if your association membership entitles you to a dis-
count on your auto insurance.
Health insurance
Health insurance costs continue to skyrocket, and finding ways to
reduce them can seriously help your household budget. Here are
some suggestions:
 Talk with your employer’s health plan administrator, or with
your insurance broker or agent if you are not part of a group
plan, about what you can do to lower your monthly health
insurance costs. Possibilities may include increasing your
annual deductible, switching insurance companies, or chang-
ing plans. Keep the following in mind:
• If you’re willing to sacrifice the freedom to go to what-
ever doctor, pharmacy, or hospital you want, you can
save money. Sign up with a plan that limits your choices;
the more flexibility, the more costly the plan.
• If someone in your family has a preexisting medical con-
dition, don’t change plans or insurers before you are
clear about how coverage for that condition may be
affected. Some plans or providers may refuse to cover
the condition at all or may not cover it for a period of
time — six months to a year, for example.
• Be aware that the insurance plan with the lowest pre-
mium cost is not a good deal if it doesn’t offer the cover-
age and benefits you need. In the long run, paying a little
extra to have the appropriate coverage may mean lower
out-of-pocket expenses for doctors, hospitals, and pre-
scription drugs.
 If your income is low and you have few if any assets of value,
find out if you qualify for Medicaid, a federal/state health
Chapter 5: Slashing Your Spending and Making More Money 77

insurance program that is state administered. To check on
your eligibility, go to www.familiesusa.org, click on
“Consumer Assistance Program Locator,” and choose your
state. You’ll get a direct link to your state’s Medicaid office.
 If you don’t qualify for Medicaid, you may be able to get health
coverage for your children through the federal State Children’s
Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). Go to www.insurekidsnow.
gov for information about the program in your state.
Bringing in More Bucks
If slashing your spending doesn’t free up all the money you need to
meet your financial obligations and accelerate the rate at which
you pay off your debts, look for ways to increase your household’s
monthly income. Maybe what it will take to improve your financial
outlook is working extra hours at your current job (if you’re paid
by the hour), taking a second job, or working for yourself as a free-
lancer. This section discusses the in and outs of each of these
income boosters.
If your spouse or partner is a stay-at-home parent and he or she is
considering getting a paying job, take into account the costs of
working outside the home, such as childcare and transportation,
so you can be sure that the change makes financial sense. The
online calculator at www.fincalc.com/bud_06.asp?id=6 makes
that analysis easy.
If making more money will be an uphill battle because demand for
your skills is declining or because the industry you work in is
depressed, consider getting trained for a new career by attending
your local community college or a reputable trade school. Before
you leap into anything, however, find out where the experts expect
future job opportunities to be. Start your research by looking
through the Occupational Outlook Handbook and the Career Guide
to Industries, two publications available at the Web site of the U.S.
Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics, www.bls.gov.
Earning more at your current job
Your current employer may be an immediate source of additional
income. If you are paid by the hour, let your boss know that you
want to work additional hours. If demand for your employer’s prod-
uct or service is growing or if your employer is opening a new office
or store, you may be able to add another shift to your schedule,
work longer each day, or work on weekends, especially if you have
a good reputation as an employee.

78

Asking for a raise is another option, assuming you can justify your
request. For example, a raise may be in order if you have not
received one in a long time, if you have assumed new responsibili-
ties without additional compensation, or if you recently completed
an important project. Other possible reasons to ask for a raise
include a stellar performance review and the fact that co-workers
in your same position may be paid more than you.
Another way to earn more money at your current place of employ-
ment is to apply for a promotion. Let your boss know that you
want to be considered for a higher paying job in your same depart-
ment. If you’re qualified to work in other departments, schedule a
time to meet with the managers of those departments to let them
know that you are interested in working for them.
Looking for a new job
Getting a better paying job with a new employer is another obvious
way to boost your income. In this section, we share tips for start-
ing a job search.
Doing your homework
Prepare for your job hunt by whipping your résumé into shape,
writing a short but snappy cover letter, and honing your interview
skills. If you need help doing any of these things, you’ll find a wealth
of free information on the Web. Here are a few sites to check out:
 The Writing Center at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute: This
site (www.wecc.rpi.edu) offers a clear, step-by-step process
for creating a winning résumé. Click on “E-handouts,” and look
for “Resumes.”
 The Career Advice section of Monster.com: At www.
monster.com, you can find résumé assistance, help figuring
out how much salary to ask for, and a self-assessment center
for evaluating your skills and abilities. You also get career-
specific advice based on whether you want to change careers,
are looking for a job, or are 50 years old or over. You can even
go through a virtual interview to help prepare for the kinds of
questions you’re likely to be asked in a job interview.
 Career Builder: This Web site helps you build an online
résumé from scratch or improve the one you already have.
Then you can post it at the site so employers who are looking
for someone like you can see it. To access the site’s résumé
building help, go to www.careerbuilder.com and click on
“Post Resumes” at the top of the home page. Then click on
“Build Your Resume.”
 The Wall Street Journal’s Career Journal: The site www.
careerjournal.com/jobhunting features a “Job-Hunting
Chapter 5: Slashing Your Spending and Making More Money 79

Advice” section that is full of useful articles and tips on using
the Internet to find a job, creating effective résumés and cover
letters, job search strategies, interviewing tips, strategies for
negotiating your salary, and more.
Finding out about new job opportunities
So when your résumé and cover letter are up-to-date, and you’re
ready to turn a practice interview into a real one, how do you find
potential employers? Here are some ideas:
 Let your friends know that you’re in the market for a better
paying job. They can keep their eyes and ears open for oppor-
tunities at their workplaces.
 Visit job search Web sites. Scope out a variety of job sites to
figure out which ones best meet your needs and are easiest to
use. Here are some possibilities:
• National online job Web sites like CareerBuilder (www.
careerbuilder.com), Job-Hunt.org (www.job-hunt.
org), Monster.com (www.monster.com), and America’s
Job Bank (www.ajb.dni.us). Some of these sites will
send you e-mail alerts to let you know about new job
listings that match your job search criteria.
• Niche online job sites that focus on a narrowly defined
type of job or on jobs within a specific industry. For
example, www.dice.com focuses on high tech jobs; www.
bankingboard.com zeroes in on jobs in the mortgage
banking, title, escrow, and real estate fields; and www.
allretailjobs.com focuses on — you guessed it — all
types of positions in the retail world.
• Your state’s employment office. Most of these sites
include a job bank of openings with local and national
private sector employers, nonprofits, state government,
and sometimes local governments.
• The Web sites of your local and county government.
These sites may feature job banks with a focus on gov-
ernment job openings in your specific locale.
• The Web sites of any professional or trade organizations
you belong to. Many of these organizations list job open-
ings of specific interest to their members.
• www.craigslist.com. Craigslist features traditional and
offbeat job listings for many larger cities.
Visit the QuintCareers Web site (www.quintcareers.com/
top_50_sites.html) for descriptions and links to 50 great
job sites. Also, search for jobs by industry type — from
jobs in the airline industry and law enforcement to jobs in
academia, fashion, retail, finance, and advertising — at www.
quintcareers.com/indres.html.

80

 Read the employment listings in your local newspaper or in
newspapers in nearby areas.
 Attend job fairs. Job fairs are a great way to meet employers
in your area who are hiring. You may even have the opportu-
nity to do some initial interviews at the job fairs or to set up
interviews for a later date. You can find out about job fairs
through your local media; by visiting www.careerfairs.com,
www.careerbuilder.com, or other Web sites dedicated to job
fairs; and by searching the Internet.
 Network. Many great jobs are never advertised online or in
newspapers. Instead, they are filled via word of mouth,
through networking. Networking involves letting anyone and
everyone know that you are looking for a job, including your
former bosses, professional associates, friends, relatives,
neighbors, elected officials you may know, and even people
you just happen to meet. Any of these individuals may know
about a job opening that would be perfect for you.
You can also network by attending networking events. For
example, your local Chamber of Commerce may sponsor
breakfasts, luncheons, or happy hours that are organized to
help professionals network. Other good networking opportuni-
ties include meetings of your alumni association, meetings of
clubs and associations you may belong to, community events,
cocktail parties and dinner parties, and conferences — just
about anywhere that you are going to be with other people.
When you are networking, be prepared to explain in concise
terms exactly what type of job you are looking for and to
describe your skills and experience. You may have only a few
minutes to make a good first impression.
Carry business cards with you at all times in order to take full
advantage of every networking opportunity that comes your
way, and whenever you meet people who could be helpful in
your job search, get their business cards so you can follow up.
You may even want to carry copies of your résumé with you
whenever you leave your home so you can pass them out when
appropriate. For more information about all aspects of network-
ing, go to www.careerjournal.com/jobhunting/networking.
 Schedule an appointment with an employment agency in
your area or with an executive recruitment firm (also
known as a headhunter) if you are looking for a mid- to
upper-level management position.
Employment agencies and executive recruitment firms are
paid a fee for linking up employers and employees. Typically,
employers pay the fees of executive search firms, but you may
have to pay the fee if an employment agency finds you a job.
Be clear about who will pay before you sign an agreement with
Chapter 5: Slashing Your Spending and Making More Money 81

a business that says it will try to help you find employment. If
you’ll be responsible for the fee, make certain you understand
the amount and the conditions of the fee you’ll owe.
Getting (and surviving) a second job
Thinking about making more money by working at another job,
known as moonlighting? Join the crowd. According to the U.S.
Department of Labor, about 7.2 million Americans hold down more
than one job. You can find a second job by using the same job-
hunting resources we suggest in the previous section.
Moonlighting can be a great way to make some extra bucks, as long
as your second job doesn’t interfere with your ability to be effec-
tive at your primary job. You also need to make sure that you’ll
come out ahead financially after taking into account any additional
expenses you may incur by working two jobs: transportation,
childcare, food costs, and so on.
If you signed a contract with your current employer, read it before
you take a second job. The contract may prohibit you from work-
ing for specific types of employers or from moonlighting at all.
If you feel like your life is already a juggling act, a second job is
going to make keeping all your balls in the air even more of a chal-
lenge. However, you can take steps to alleviate some of the stress
that working multiple jobs may create. For example,
 Ask your spouse or partner and your older children to
assume more of the day-to-day household chores if you are
the one who is responsible for most of them.
 Create a schedule of when things need to be done, and post it
on your family’s bulletin board or refrigerator.
 Accept the fact that for now, some things at home will fall
through the cracks, and everything may not get done accord-
ing to your standards.
 Make casseroles, soups, and other nutritious one-pot meals that
you can freeze and that will feed your family for several days.
 Try to find a second job you enjoy doing — maybe a job that
relates to a hobby or special interest of yours. You won’t be as
likely to resent the extra work if what you are doing is fun.
 Avoid taking a second job that involves a lot of pressure and
stress, especially if you’re already under a lot of pressure and
stress at your main job. You’ll quickly burn yourself out, and
you may begin having health problems.
Part II: Going on a Debt Diet 
82

 Look for a second job that is relatively close to either your
home or your main job so you are not spending a lot of time
commuting.
 Grab naps when you can!
Considering freelancing
Depending on what type of skills you have, you may be able to
boost your income by doing part-time freelance work. When you
are a freelancer, you are self-employed and offer your services to
other businesses. For example, you may be a freelance copywriter,
graphic designer, software designer, CPA, and so on.
Working for yourself may sound appealing and can be quite prof-
itable, but if you need an immediate infusion of cash, it’s probably
not your best bet. Usually, before you can expect to see any money
from freelancing, you have to
 Prepare information explaining your services.
 Decide how you will charge for your services (by the hour, by
the project, or on a monthly retainer basis, for example) and
how much you will charge.
 Let potential clients know about your services and then hope
that some of them will contract with you.
 After you are hired, invoice your clients and cross your fin-
gers that they’ll pay you quickly.
Obviously, being a successful freelancer, especially when you’re
holding down a regular job, takes organization, self-discipline, the
ability to manage numerous tasks simultaneously, and a little bit of
luck. However, if freelancing appeals to you, here are some ways to
find out more about the process and about potential freelancing
opportunities:
 Talk to people you know who are already freelancing.
 Let your former employers know you would like some freelance
work.
 Visit www.quintcareers.com/freelancing_career.html.
 Read Freelancing For Dummies by Susan M. Drake (Wiley).
There is a For Dummies book for everything, isn’t there?
 Register at www.guru.com so that businesses looking for some-
one who offers your type of service know how to find you.
Chapter 5: Slashing Your Spending and Making More Money 83

When you freelance, your clients won’t deduct taxes from the
money they pay you. Therefore, you owe those taxes to Uncle Sam
on April 15. If you are making a considerable amount from freelanc-
ing, it’s a good idea to pay your taxes quarterly. Otherwise, you
may end up in hot water with the IRS if your tax return shows that
you owe more taxes than you can afford to pay when April 15
comes around. Meet with your CPA to figure out the best way to
handle your taxes as a freelancer.

84
The skinny on business scams
Beware of business “opportunity” scams that you may find out about on the Internet,
in your local newspaper, through the mail, and so on. Typically, the promoters of these
scams promise that you’ll earn big bucks after you pay them for equipment, software,
supplies, training materials, and/or business leads. Typically, the value of what they
sell you is negligible and far less than the fee you pay to the business promoters. Two
of the most common work-at-home scams are envelope stuffing and medical billing.
If a business opportunity sounds interesting, ask the promoter to send you printed
information about its offer. Among other things, the information should
 Indicate the promoter’s name, address, and phone number.
 Explain the business opportunity in detail — what you will get for your money
and what assistance the promoter will give you.
 State the opportunity’s total cost, as well as how and how often you’ll be paid,
who will pay you, and all terms and conditions for getting paid.
Ask for the names and phone numbers of people who have pursued the business
opportunity, and contact them to find out if it lived up to their expectations. If the
business promoter offers instead to provide you with a list of testimonials from
happy business owners, don’t accept it. The testimonials may be made up. Don’t
work with a business opportunity promoter who has no information to send you or
no references you can contact.
Also, ask to see a copy of the contract you will have to sign if you agree to work
with the promoter. The contact information should match the company’s printed
information and whatever you may have been told via an e-mail or over the phone.
Federal law requires promoters who charge more than $500 for a business oppor-
tunity to also tell you how much you can earn from the opportunity and the number
and the percentage of individuals who have earned at least that much recently.
Never pay any money to one of these companies without checking first with your
local Better Business Bureau and with the Better Business Bureau where the com-
pany is located, as well as with your state attorney general’s office and with the
Federal Trade Commission. They can tell you if they’ve received complaints from
consumers who feel that a business opportunity promoter ripped them off. Contact
these same organizations if you get ripped off by a business opportunity scam, and
talk to a consumer law attorney if you lost a substantial amount of money as a result.

Negotiating with
Your Creditors
In This Chapter

I
f slashing your spending, making more money, and living on a
strict budget are not enough to resolve your financial problems,
it’s time to bite the bullet and contact your creditors. You want to
find out if they will negotiate new, more affordable debt payment
plans so you can get caught up with whatever is past due and con-
tinue paying on your debts. You may resist the idea of negotiating,
but getting some relief from your debts can mean no more futile
struggles to keep up with what you owe, an end to threatening let-
ters and calls from annoying debt collectors, and less damage to
your credit history.
We can’t guarantee that 100 percent of your creditors will agree to
sit down at the bargaining table with you. But if you contact them
soon enough — as soon as you realize it’s going to be a struggle to
keep up with your debts, or as soon as you begin to fall behind on
your payments — we bet that most creditors agree to work with
you. They may not give you everything you ask for, but just a few
concessions from your creditors can make a big difference to the
state of your finances and, ultimately, can help keep you out of
bankruptcy court.
In this chapter, we tell you about the preparation you should do
before you contact any of your creditors, and we fill you in on how
to contact them and who to speak with. We also explain what you
should and should not say during your negotiations and highlight
the importance of putting in writing the details of any agreement
you may reach with a creditor.

Getting Ready to Negotiate
Upfront planning and organizing is essential to the success of any
negotiation, whether you’re trying to negotiate world peace or con-
vince one of your creditors to let you pay less each month or have
a lower interest rate.
Your upfront planning and organizing should include
 Creating a detailed list of your debts.
 Deciding which debts to negotiate first and what you want to
ask from each of your creditors.
 Reviewing your budget (or creating one if you don’t have one
yet — see Chapter 4).
 Pulling together your financial information.
In this section, we walk you through each of these steps. If you
don’t do the necessary planning and organizing, you won’t have
any idea what you really need from each creditor and what you can
offer in return. You’ll be shooting in the dark, and the results could
be disastrous for your finances.
If you don’t feel comfortable about doing your own negotiating,
you may want to ask your attorney or CPA to handle it for you if
you have a long-established relationship with that person.
Assuming you have that kind of relationship, the CPA or attorney
may agree to help you out for very little money. Another option is
to get negotiating help from a nonprofit credit counseling agency in
your area. (In Chapter 8, we explain how to choose a credit coun-
seling agency and review the various ways that it can help you
with your debts.) You can also ask a friend or relative for help,
especially if you know someone who is good at making deals.
Listing all your debts
Create a list of all your debts, separating the ones that are high pri-
ority from the ones that are low priority. (In Chapter 4, we distin-
guish between these two types of debt.) For each debt on your list,
record the following information:
 The name of the creditor
 The amount you are supposed to pay every month
 The interest rate on the debt
 The debt’s outstanding balance
Part II: Going on a Debt Diet 
86

Also, note whether you are current or behind on your payments. If
you are behind, record the number of months you are in arrears
and the total amount that is past due.
You should also note whether a debt is secured or unsecured. For
each secured debt, write down the asset that secures it. For exam-
ple, your car secures your auto loan, and your house secures your
mortgage and any home equity loans you may have. (In Chapter 4,
we explain the differences between secured and unsecured debts.)
When you list your unsecured debts, like your credit card debts
and past-due medical bills, list them according to their interest
rates. Put the debt with the highest rate at the very top of the list,
followed by the one with the next highest rate, and so on.
Leave space next to each debt on your list for recording the new
payment amount you would like each creditor to agree to, or for
recording any other changes you want from a creditor, such as a
lower interest rate or the ability to make interest-only payments
for a period of time. You will record this information after you have
reviewed your budget.
Zeroing in on certain debts first
As we explain in Chapter 4, all debts are not created equal. Some
debts are more important than others because the consequences
of falling behind on those obligations are a lot more severe. For
example, if you don’t keep up with your secured debts, the credi-
tors may take back their collateral: the assets you used to guaran-
tee payment. You could also lose assets if you don’t pay the taxes
you owe to the IRS. (Part III of this book offers specific information
about negotiating various types of high priority debts.) Therefore,
when you are preparing to negotiate with your creditors, negotiate
these debts first:
 Your mortgage
 Your past-due rent
 Your car loan
 Your utility bills
 Your court-ordered child support obligation

Chapter 6: Negotiating with Your Creditors 87

During your negotiations, don’t be so eager to reach an agreement
with one of your creditors that you offer to pay more than you
really can afford. Also, don’t agree to a temporary change in how
you pay a debt if you really need the change to be permanent. If
you can’t live up to the agreement as a result, most creditors prob-
ably won’t negotiate with you again.
When you negotiate your lower priority debts, which will probably
all be unsecured debts (such as credit card debt and medical bills),
start by negotiating the one with the highest rate of interest. That’s
because the debt is costing you the most each month.
Reviewing your budget
After you create your list of debts, it’s time to review your house-
hold budget. You need to figure out exactly what you need from
each creditor in order to be able to pay off any past-due amounts
and keep up with future payments. For example, you may want a
creditor to agree to
 Lower the amount of your monthly payments on a permanent
or temporary basis.
 Lower your interest rates.
 Let you make interest-only payments for a while.
 Waive or lower certain fees.
 Let you pay the amount that is past due by adding that total
to the end of your loan rather than paying a portion of the
past-due amount each month.
If you are at least 120 days past due on a debt, you may want to ask
the creditor to let you settle the debt for less than the full amount
you owe on it. The creditor may be willing to do that if it’s con-
vinced that settling is its best shot at getting at least some of what
you owe. For example, the creditor may know that suing you for
the full amount of your debt would be a waste of time because you
are judgment proof: You have no assets that the creditor can take,
and your state prohibits wage garnishment.
There can be federal tax ramifications to settling a debt for less.
The amount the creditor writes off is treated as income to you and
may increase the amount you owe to the IRS when your taxes are
due. For example, if you owe $10,000 to a creditor and the creditor
agrees to let you settle the debt for $6,000, it sends the IRS a 1099
form reporting the $4,000 difference as your income. However, you
may not be affected if you are insolvent by IRS 1099 standards. A
CPA can tell you if the IRS considers you to be insolvent.
Part II: Going on a Debt Diet 
88

When one of your creditors agrees to let you settle a debt for less,
ask the creditor to report the debt as current and to remove all
negative information related to the debt from your credit report.
The creditor may or may not comply with your requests, but you
won’t know unless you ask.
Chapter 6: Negotiating with Your Creditors 89
Negotiating basics
When they sit down at the bargaining table, savvy negotiators employ some basic
rules to increase their chances of leaving with a deal that makes them happy. So
take a cue from them by keeping the following in mind when you negotiate with your
creditors:
 Never put all your cards on the table. When you tell a creditor how much you
can afford to pay on a debt each month, the number of months that you want to
make interest-only payments, and so on, always hold a little back. By not let-
ting the creditor know right away what your bottom-line offer is, you give your-
self some room to negotiate. If you are lucky, the creditor will accept your initial
offer. But if the creditor responds with a counteroffer — maybe he wants you
to pay a little more each month than you’ve suggested, or he offers to lower
your interest rate two percentage points when you had asked for a four-point
reduction — you can either respond with another offer or accept the creditor’s
offer and still be better off financially than you are now.
 Know your bottom line. Know the minimum that you need to get out of your
negotiations and the most that you can afford to give to a creditor. Never agree
to more than that.
 Understand that you have to give a little to get a little. A negotiation is success-
ful when both parties leave the bargaining table with something. For example, in
exchange for a creditor agreeing to lower your monthly payments, you may have
to give the creditor a lien on another one of your assets. However, your goal is to
give as little as possible in exchange for getting as much as possible.
 Recognize who has the edge in your negotiations. Whoever has the edge will
have a stronger bargaining position, and the other person will have to give a
little extra in order to have any chance of leaving the bargaining table with
something. Your creditors will almost always be in a stronger position than you.
That’s certainly true for your secured creditors because if you can’t strike a deal
with them, they know they can always take your collateral back.
 Never be demanding, and never get angry or confrontational. If you do, the
creditor may simply cut off the negotiations. When you feel like you are about
to lose your cool, end the conversation and resume it after you’ve had an oppor-
tunity to clear your head and calm down.

Pulling together your 
financial information
Some creditors may want to review your financial information
before they agree to negotiate with you or agree to the changes
you request. Prepare for that possibility by gathering together the
following information and putting everything in one place for easy
access:
 Your household budget
 The list of all your debts
 A list of your assets and their approximate values
Sharing information about your assets with your creditors can
be dangerous. If one of them decides to sue you to collect on
your debt, you’ve made it easy for that creditor to figure out
which asset(s) to go after. However, if you are anxious to
strike deals with your creditors so you can continue paying
off your debts, you are between a rock and a hard place; you
may have no option but to share the information with them.
Another risk you take by sharing information about your
assets is that a creditor may demand that you sell one of your
assets and give it the sale proceeds. However, you don’t have
to take that step unless you want to and unless doing so is in
your best financial interest.
 Copies of your loan agreements
After you have pulled together your financial information, review
your list of assets to determine if you can use any of them as collat-
eral. (Ordinarily, you must own the assets free and clear in order to
use them as collateral.) Perhaps you own a boat, motorcycle, or
RV, for example. As a condition of agreeing to lower your monthly
payments or to let you make interest-only payments for a couple
months, one of your secured creditors may require that you
increase your collateral. If you do not have any assets that you can
use as collateral, the creditors may decide it is too risky to work
with you, and they may decide to take back the collateral you’ve
already used to secure your debts with them.
A creditor may make having a cosigner a condition of any new
agreement. We suggest that you determine ahead of time if a friend
or relative would be willing to cosign for you. As a cosigner, your
friend or relative will be as responsible for living up to the agree-
ment as you are, which means that if you default on the agreement,
Part II: Going on a Debt Diet 
90

the creditor can look to your cosigner for payment. To be fair,
before you ask someone to cosign for you, be sure that you can
live up to the terms of the agreement. Also, make your friend or rel-
ative aware of the risks of cosigning before she signs any paper-
work related to the agreement.
Getting Down to Business:
Contacting Creditors
After you’ve completed all your upfront planning and organizing,
you’re ready to begin contacting your creditors. How you contact
them — in person or by phone — and who you talk to will depend
on the type of creditor. For example, if the creditor is local (and
not part of a national chain), an in-person meeting is appropriate,
and you probably want to meet with the owner, credit manager, or
office manager. However, if you want to negotiate your MasterCard
or Visa bill, your mortgage, or the debt you owe to a national retail
chain, for example, you start negotiating by calling the company’s
customer service number.
If a creditor asks you to put your negotiating request in writing,
send the details of your request via certified mail and request a
return receipt. That way, you have confirmation that your letter
was received, and you will know when to follow up.
Whenever you speak with someone, maintain a record of who you
spoke to (name and title), the date of your conversation, what you
asked for, how the creditor responded, and the specifics of any
agreement you reached. You should also file away all correspon-
dence related to your negotiations that you send or receive.
When you contact a creditor for the first time, explain that you are
having financial problems and provide a general explanation of
why the problems have occurred. For example,
 You lost your job.
 Your child is ill, and you have been saddled with a lot of unre-
imbursed medical expenses.
 Your former spouse is not paying you the child support you’re
entitled to.
 You took on too much credit card debt.
Chapter 6: Negotiating with Your Creditors 91

Give the creditor confidence that you’ll be able to live up to any
agreement you may reach with one another by explaining what you
are doing (or have already done) to improve your financial situa-
tion and to minimize the likelihood that you’ll develop money
problems in the future. For example,
 You are living on a strict budget.
 You have enrolled in a money management class.
 You are working at a second job.
 Your spouse has taken a job outside the home.
Tell the creditor that you want to continue paying on your debt,
but in order to do so you need the creditor to agree to some
changes. Be specific about exactly what you want the creditor to
agree to. For example, you would like to pay $100 less each month
on your debt or to make interest-only payments for three months.
If you get nowhere with the first person you speak with, end your
conversation and try negotiating with someone higher up, like a
supervisor or a manager. That person is likely to have more 
decision-making authority and to be in a position to agree to your
request. In fact, when you call a creditor for the first time, you may
want to ask the person you speak with if he has the authority to
negotiate with you. If that person does not, ask who does.
Some of your creditors may refuse to negotiate directly with you
and may indicate that you should contact a credit counseling
agency and let it do the negotiating for you. In Chapter 8, we tell
you how credit counseling agencies work.
If the person you are negotiating with tries to pressure you into
paying more than you can afford, stick to your guns.
Making the Agreement Official:
Putting It in Writing
Whenever you and a creditor reach an agreement, ask for the
agreement to be put in writing. If the creditor refuses, prepare the
agreement yourself, date and sign it, and then send a copy to the
creditor. The agreement should include
 Its duration.
 All deadlines.
 All payment amounts.
Part II: Going on a Debt Diet 
92

 Applicable interest rates.
 The amount of any fees you have agreed to and under what
circumstance you must pay each fee.
 Everything the creditor has agreed to do or not do. For exam-
ple, the creditor may agree to waive certain fees, forgive a
past-due amount, or not report to the credit bureaus that your
account is delinquent.
 When you and the creditor will be considered in default of the
agreement and the consequences of the default
If a problem develops with your agreement after it is official — if
your creditor violates some aspect of the agreement or accuses
you of doing the same thing — and you do not have the terms of
the agreement in writing, resolving your differences may be diffi-
cult. Each of you is apt to have different memories of the agree-
ment details. As a result, you may both have to hire attorneys to
help you work out your disagreement, and you may end up in
court where a judge will decide what to do.
Before you sign any agreement that you may reach with a creditor,
especially if it involves a lot of money or an asset that you do not
want to lose, ask a consumer law attorney to review the agree-
ment. You want to be sure that you are adequately protected and
that the agreement does not have the potential to create future
problems for you.
Don’t hire an attorney until you have found out how much he will
charge to do the review, which should not take more than one hour
of his time. Most attorneys charge between $100 and $500 per hour
for their services, depending on where they practice law and the
size of the law firms they work for: Attorneys in metropolitan areas
on the East and West coasts tend to charge more than attorneys in
rural areas or in the Midwest. Attorneys who work for large firms
tend to charge more per hour than attorneys with smaller firms.
If you cannot afford to hire an attorney, you may be able to get
help from the Legal Aid Society in your area, which is essentially a
law firm for poor people. Also, if there is a law school in your area,
it may run a legal clinic, and an attorney or law school student with
the clinic can review your agreement for free. Another option is to
contact your local or state bar association to find out if it can refer
you to a consumer law attorney who does a lot of pro bono work
for financially strapped consumers.
After you have a final agreement with a creditor, revise your
budget accordingly. When you are ready to contact another credi-
tor, be sure that you prepare for your negotiations by working with
the revised budget, not with your old one.

Chapter 7
Consolidating Your Debts
In This Chapter
 Understanding when debt consolidation makes sense
 Getting a rundown on your consolidation options
 Steering clear of options that can make your finances worse
D
ebt consolidation is another option for managing your debts
when you owe too much to your creditors. It involves using
new debt to pay off existing debt. When done right, it can help you
get out of debt faster and pay less in interest on your debts.
Although debt consolidation is not the answer to your money prob-
lems, in many situations it can help when you use it together with
other debt management strategies in this book. However, if your
finances are in really bad shape, consolidating your debts probably
won’t help much, if at all.
In this chapter, we explain when debt consolidation is and isn’t a
good debt management strategy. We also review the various ways
you can consolidate your debts, explain how each option works,
and review its advantages and disadvantages. We then warn you
against dangerous debt consolidation offers that harm, not help,
your finances.
Knowing When Debt Consolidation
Makes Sense
When you consolidate debt, you use credit to pay off multiple
debts, exchanging multiple monthly payments to creditors for a
single payment. When done right, debt consolidation can help you
accelerate the rate at which you get out of debt, lower the amount
of interest you have to pay to your creditors, and improve your
credit rating. However, to achieve these potential debt consolida-
tion benefits, the following criteria need to apply:

 The interest rate on the new debt is lower than the rates on
the debts you consolidate. For example, say you have debt on
credit cards with interest rates of 22 percent, 20 percent, and
18 percent. If you transfer the debt to a credit card with a rate
of 15 percent, or you get a bank loan at a rate of 10 percent
and use it to pay off the credit card debt, you improve your
situation.
 You lower the total amount of money you have to pay on
your debts each month.
 You don’t trade fixed-rate debt for variable-rate debt. The
risk you take with a variable rate is that although the rate may
start out low, it could move up. Worst-case scenario: The rate
could increase so much that you end up paying more each
month on your debt.
 You pay off the new debt as quickly as you can. Ideally, you
apply all the money you save by consolidating (and more, if
possible) to paying off the new debt.
 You commit to not taking on any additional debt until you
pay off the debt you consolidated.
Paying less on your debts isn’t the only benefit of debt consolida-
tion. Another advantage is that by juggling fewer payment due
dates, you should be able to pay your bills on time more easily. 
On-time payments translate into fewer late fees and less damage to
your credit history.
However, too many consumers consolidate their debts and then
get deep in debt all over again because they are not good money
managers, because they have spending problems, or because they
feel under less pressure after they’ve consolidated, so they get
careless about their finances. For these consumers, debt consoli-
dation becomes a dangerous, no-win habit.
Considering Your Options
You can consolidate your debts in several ways. Your options
include
 Transferring high interest credit card debt to a credit card
with a lower interest rate.
 Getting a bank loan.
 Borrowing against your whole life insurance policy.
 Borrowing from your retirement account.
Part II: Going on a Debt Diet 
96

Deciding if debt consolidation is right for you and which option is
best can be confusing. If you need help figuring out what to do, talk
to your CPA or financial advisor, or get affordable advice from a
reputable nonprofit credit counseling organization (see Chapter 8).
The more debt you are thinking about consolidating, the more
important it is to seek objective advice from a qualified financial
professional. Otherwise, you may make an expensive mistake.
Transferring balances
Transferring high interest credit card debt to a lower interest credit
card — the lower, the better — is an easy way to consolidate debt.
You can make the transfer by using a lower rate card that you already
have, or you can use the Web to shop for a new card with a more
attractive balance transfer option. Sites to shop at include www.
cardtrak.com, www.cardweb.com, and www.cardratings.com.
Before you transfer balances, read all the information provided 
by the card issuer that explains the terms and conditions of the
transfer — the stuff in tiny print. After you review it, you may con-
clude that the offer isn’t as good as it appeared at first glance. For
example, you may find that the transfer offer comes with a lot of
expensive fees and penalties and that the interest rate on the
transferred debt can skyrocket if you are just one date late with a
payment.
Also, higher interest rates (not the balance transfer interest rate)
will apply to any new purchases you make with the card, as well as
to any cash advances you get from it. If the credit card offer does
not spell out what the higher rates are, contact the card issuer to
find out.
When a credit card company mails you a preapproved balance
transfer offer, the interest rate on the offer may not apply to you.
That’s because most offers entitle the credit card company to
increase the interest rate after reviewing your credit history.
To be sure that a balance transfer offer will really save you money,
ask the following questions:
 What’s the interest rate on the offer, and how long will the
rate last? Many credit card companies try to entice you with a
low rate balance transfer offer, but the offer interest rate may
expire after a couple months, and then it may increase consid-
erably. In fact, you could find yourself paying a higher rate of
interest on the transferred debt than you were paying before.
If you can’t afford to pay off the new debt while the low rate
Chapter 7: Consolidating Your Debts 97

offer is in effect, don’t make the transfer unless the higher rate
will still be lower than the rates you are currently paying.
Some people try to avoid higher rates on transferred credit
card debt by regularly moving the debt from one card to
another. Doing so damages your credit history and hurts your
credit scores.
 What must I do to keep the interest rate low? Know the
rules! Usually, a low rate will escalate if you don’t make your
card payments on time. However, if the card you use to con-
solidate debt includes a universal default clause, the credit
card company can raise your interest rate at any time if it
reviews your credit history and notices that you were late
with a payment to another creditor, took on a lot of new debt,
bounced a check, and so on.
The method you use to transfer credit card debt — going to
the bank to get a cash advance through your credit card, writ-
ing a convenience check, or handling the transfer by phone or
at the Web site of the credit card company — can affect the
interest rate you end up paying on the new debt, as well as
the fees you’re charged as a result of the transfer. Typically,
getting a cash advance at your bank is the most costly option.
Before you transfer credit card debt, get clear about the inter-
est rate and fees associated with each transfer option, and
choose the one that costs the least.
If you decide to use one of the convenience checks you
receive from a credit card company, be aware that some of
those checks may have lower interest rates than others, and
the interest rates associated with some of the checks may last
longer than others. The terms associated with each check
should be spelled out in the information the credit card com-
pany mailed with the checks. If you are confused, call the
credit card company.
 When will interest begin to accrue on the debt I transfer?
Usually, the answer is “right away.”
 How much is the balance transfer fee? Fees vary, but typi-
cally they are a percentage of the amount you transfer, usually
with a max of $50 to $75. Some credit card companies charge
a flat balance transfer fee.
 What method will the credit card company use to compute
my monthly payments? Credit card companies use one of
several types of balance computation methods to determine
the amount you must pay each month, and some methods
cost you more than others.
Part II: Going on a Debt Diet 
98

Look for a card that uses the adjusted balance or the average
daily balance (excluding new purchases) method to figure out
your minimum monthly payments. Avoid credit cards that use
the two-cycle average daily balance method if you can.
Also note whether the card has a 20- or a 30-day billing cycle —
the number of days between statements. You pay more to use a
card with a 20-day cycle.
If you plan to make purchases with the credit card after you’ve
paid off the transferred card balances, also pay attention to the
interest rate that applies to new purchases.
Getting a bank loan
Borrowing money from a bank (or a savings and loan or credit
union) is another way to consolidate debt. However, if your finances
are not in great shape, you may have a hard time qualifying for a
loan with an attractive interest rate.
You can use different types of loans to consolidate debt: debt con-
solidation loans, loans against the equity in your home, and loans
to refinance your mortgage.
When you’re in the market for any type of loan, it pays to shop
around. Some lenders offer better terms on their loans, and some
loan officers may be more willing than others to work with you.
However, if you have a good long-standing relationship with a
bank, contact it first.
Taking out a debt consolidation loan
As the name implies, a debt consolidation loan has the specific pur-
pose of helping you pay off debt. Depending on the state of your
finances and how much money you want to borrow, you may qualify
for an unsecured debt consolidation loan — one that doesn’t require
a lien on your assets. But under the best of circumstances, most
banks won’t lend you more than $5,000 unsecured.
If you qualify only for a secured debt consolidation loan, you have
to let the bank put a lien on one of your assets. That means if you
can’t keep up with your loan payments, you risk losing the asset. It
also means that if you have no assets to put up as collateral, get-
ting a debt consolidation loan is out of the question.
If a lender tells you that the only way you can qualify for a debt
consolidation loan is to have a friend or family member cosign the
note, think twice before you do that. As cosigner, your friend or
family member will be as obligated as you are to repay the debt. If
Chapter 7: Consolidating Your Debts 99

you can’t keep up with your payments, the lender will expect your
cosigner to finish paying off the note, and your relationship with
the cosigner may be ruined as a result. Plus, making the payments
could be a real financial hardship for your cosigner, and if she falls
behind on them, her credit history could be damaged.
Borrowing against your home equity
If you’re a homeowner and you are current on your mortgage pay-
ments, some lenders may suggest that you consolidate your debts
by borrowing against your home’s equity. Equity is the difference
between your home’s current value and the amount of money you
still owe on it. Most lenders will loan you up to 80 percent of the
equity in your home.
Some lenders let you borrow more than the value of your equity in
some cases. Never do that! If you borrow more than the value of
your equity and then you need or want to move, you won’t be able
to sell your home because you owe more on it than it is worth.
Pros and cons
Consolidating debt by using a home equity loan can be attractive
for a couple reasons:
 It’s a relatively easy way to pay off debt, and the loan’s inter-
est rate will be lower than some other debt consolidation
options.
 Assuming you’re not borrowing more than $100,000, the inter-
est you pay on the loan is tax deductible.
However, and this is a really big however, your home secures the
loan, which means that if you can’t make the loan payments, you
can lose your home. If your finances are already going down the
tubes, borrowing against the equity in your home is risky business
and just doesn’t make sense. And even if you’re able to meet your
financial obligations right now, if you owe a lot to your creditors
and you have little or nothing in savings, a job loss, an expensive
illness, or some other financial setback could make you fall behind
on your home equity loan.
Also, be aware that if you sell your home and you still owe money
on your mortgage and on your home equity loan, you have to pay
back both loans for the sale to be complete. In other words, if your
home doesn’t sell for enough to pay off everything you owe on
your home, you have to come up with enough money to pay the
difference. If the housing market in your area is cooling off, and
especially if you paid top dollar for your home, consolidating debt
by tapping your home’s equity is probably not a good move.
Part II: Going on a Debt Diet 
100

If you do decide that a home equity loan makes sense for you, keep
the following in mind:
 Borrow as little as possible, not necessarily the total amount
that the lender says you can borrow.
 Pay off the debt as quickly as you can. Lenders typically offer
very relaxed home equity loan repayment terms, and why
not? The longer it takes you to repay your home equity debt,
the more money the lender earns in interest.
 Know your rights. When you borrow against your home, the
Federal Truth in Lending Act requires lenders to give you a
three-day cooling off period after you sign the loan paper-
work. During this time, you can cancel the loan in writing. If
you do, the lender must cancel its lien on your home and
refund all the fees you’ve paid.
 Beware of predatory home equity lenders who encourage you
to lie on your loan application so you can borrow more money
than you actually qualify for. These lenders gamble that you’ll
default on the loan and they’ll end up with your home. The
same is true of unscrupulous home equity lenders who over-
appraise your home (give it a greater value than it’s really
worth) in order to lend you more money than you can afford
to repay.
Also, steer clear of lenders who want you to sign loan agree-
ments before all the terms of the loan are spelled out in black
and white, and avoid loans with prepayment penalties.
Two ways to borrow against your home equity
You can tap the equity in your home in one of two ways: by getting
a home equity loan or by using a home equity line of credit. Here’s
a quick overview of how each option works:
 Home equity loan: The loan has a fixed or variable interest
rate, and you repay it by making regular monthly payments
for a set amount of money over a specific period of time. If
you apply for a variable rate loan, be sure you understand
what will trigger rate increases and the likely amount of each
increase. If you’re not careful, the initial rate can increase so
much that you may begin having problems making your loan
payments.
 Home equity line of credit (HELOC): A HELOC functions a lot
like a variable rate credit card. You’re approved to borrow up
to a certain amount of money — your credit limit — and you
can tap the credit whenever you want, usually by writing a
check. Typically, a lender calculates the total amount of your
credit line by taking a percentage (usually between 75 and 80
Chapter 7: Consolidating Your Debts 101

percent) of your home’s appraised value and then subtracting
from it the outstanding balance on your mortgage. The lender
also reviews your credit history and/or credit score and takes
a look at your overall financial condition.
While you have to repay a home equity loan by making fixed
monthly payments that include both interest and principal,
with a HELOC you usually have the option of making interest-
only payments each month or paying interest and principal on
the debt. If you opt to make interest-only payments, the
amount of the payments depends on the applicable interest
rate and on how much of your total credit limit you are using.
For example, if you have a $10,000 HELOC but you’ve bor-
rowed only $5,000 of that money, the amount of interest is cal-
culated on the $5,000.
The problem with making interest-only payments is that the
longer the principal is unpaid, the more your HELOC costs
you, especially if the interest rate starts to rise. Also, if your
HELOC expires after a certain number of years and there is no
provision for renewing it, the lender will probably want you to
pay the total amount you still owe in a lump sum, also known
as a balloon payment. If you can’t afford to pay it, you may
lose your home.
Federal law requires lenders to cap the interest rate they
charge on a HELOC. Before you sign any HELOC-related paper-
work, get clear on the cap that applies. Also, find out if you
can convert the HELOC to a fixed interest rate and the terms
and conditions that apply if you do.
Refinancing your mortgage and getting cash out
If you are still paying on your mortgage, refinancing the loan at a
lower rate and borrowing extra money to pay off other debts may
be another debt consolidation option to consider. (The new mort-
gage pays off your existing mortgage.) However, refinancing is a
bad idea if
 You’ve been paying on the mortgage for more than 10 years,
assuming it’s a 30-year note. During the first 10 years of a loan,
you mostly pay interest on the loan, but after 10 years, you
begin paying on the loan’s principal. This means that you are
closer to having your mortgage paid off and to owning your
home outright. If you refinance, you start all over again with a
brand-new mortgage.
 You can’t afford the payments on the new loan. If you fall
behind, eventually your mortgage lender will initiate a 
foreclosure.
Part II: Going on a Debt Diet 
102

It may make sense to consolidate debt by going from a 30-year note
to a 15-year note, assuming you can afford the higher monthly pay-
ments. (You pay less interest on a 15-year mortgage, so going from
a 30-year to a 15-year loan won’t mean doubling your monthly pay-
ments.) Run the numbers with your loan officer.
You’re playing with fire if you use a mortgage refinance to consoli-
date debt by trading a traditional mortgage for an interest-only
mortgage! Sure, your monthly payments may be lower initially, but
after five years (or whenever the interest-only period ends), they
will increase substantially, maybe far beyond what you can afford.
Chapter 7: Consolidating Your Debts 103
Shopping for a home equity loan 
or line of credit
When you’re in the market for a home equity loan or a home equity line of credit,
you’re not obligated to apply only to the lender who holds your home mortgage. You
can apply to any lender who does home equity lending. So shop around for the best
deal by using the following terms of credit to compare your options:
 Annual percentage rate (APR): This is the cost of your borrowing expressed as
a yearly rate. It includes all fees and other costs that you must pay to obtain the
credit.
 Monthly periodic rate: Also referred to as a finance charge, this is the rate of
interest you’ll be charged each month on your outstanding debt. The higher the
rate, the more the debt will cost you.
 Fees: The more fees and the higher the fees you have to pay, the more it will cost
you to borrow against your home equity. Fees are usually negotiable, but if you’re
not in a strong financial position, you won’t have much bargaining power. Many
home equity loans come with the fees built in. This means that you end up bor-
rowing more money but getting less cash and paying more in interest.
 The amount of your monthly payments: If you start to fall behind on your pay-
ments because they are more than you can afford, your interest rate may
increase. If you fall too far behind, you may lose your home.
 How long you have to repay the borrowed money: The longer you take to repay
it, the more interest you pay and the greater your risk that something will happen
in your life that will make it impossible for you to repay your debt.
 Whether you have to make a balloon payment: A balloon payment is a lump
sum payment that you may owe at the end of a loan or when a home equity line
of credit expires. If you can’t afford to make the payment, you risk foreclosure,
even if you’ve made all your monthly payments on time.

Borrowing against your life 
insurance policy
If you have a whole life insurance policy, you can consolidate your
debts by borrowing against the policy’s cash value. If you have this
kind of policy, you pay a set amount of money each month or year,
and you earn interest on the policy’s cash value.
Here are two advantages of this option:
 There is no application to complete and no credit check.
 After you borrow the money, you won’t have to repay it accord-
ing to a set schedule. In fact, you won’t have to repay it at all.
But there’s a catch, of course. After you die, the insurance com-
pany will deduct the loan’s outstanding balance from the policy
proceeds. As a result, your beneficiary may end up with less than
he or she was expecting, which can create a financial hardship for
that person. For example, your surviving spouse or partner may
need the money to help pay bills after your death, or your child
may need the policy money to attend college.
Before you borrow against your life insurance, read your policy so
you understand all the loan terms and conditions. Also, be clear
about any fees you may have to pay because they will affect the
loan’s total cost. If you are unsure about anything, talk with your
insurance agent or broker.
Borrowing from your 401(k) 
retirement plan
If you’re employed, you may be enrolled in a 401(k) retirement plan
sponsored by your employer. If your employer is a nonprofit, you
may have a 403(b) retirement plan, which works like a 401(k). The
money you deposit in your retirement plan is tax-deferred income.
In other words, whatever you deposit in the account each year
won’t be recognized as income until you begin withdrawing it
during your retirement years. Your employer may match a certain
percentage of your deposits.
Most employers that offer 401(k) plans allow their employees to
borrow the funds that are in their retirement accounts, up to
$50,000 or 50 percent of the value of the account, whichever is less.
If the value is less than $20,000, your plan may allow you to borrow
as much as $10,000 even if that represents your plan’s total value.
Part II: Going on a Debt Diet

No matter how much you borrow, you have five years to repay the
money, and you’re charged interest on the unpaid balance.
Borrowing against your 401(k) plan may seem like an attractive
way to consolidate debt — after all, you’re just borrowing your
own money! There’s no loan application to complete and no credit
check. However, unless you are absolutely sure that you can and
will repay the loan within the required amount of time, taking
money out of your retirement account to pay off debt is a really
bad idea. Here’s why:
 If you don’t repay every penny within five years, and assum-
ing you are younger than 591⁄2 when you borrow the money,
you have to pay a 10 percent penalty on the unpaid balance.
On top of that, the IRS treats whatever money you don’t repay
as an early withdrawal from your retirement account, which
means that you’re taxed on it as though it’s earned income. As
a result, on April 15 you can end up owing Uncle Sam a whole
lot more in taxes than you anticipated, and you may not have
enough money to pay them. (In Chapter 14, we explain your
options for paying your taxes and tell you what the IRS may
do to collect any taxes you don’t pay.)
You may promise yourself that you’ll repay your retirement
account loan, but with no lender (or debt collector) pressur-
ing you into paying what you owe, are you disciplined enough
to do that? If you’re like a lot of consumers, you’ll keep prom-
ising yourself that you’ll pay back the loan, but you’ll never
get around to it. Or if you begin having trouble paying for
essentials, those expenses will take priority, and you may
have no money left to put toward repaying your retirement
account loan.
 Every dollar you borrow represents one less dollar you’ll have
for your retirement if you don’t repay the loan. Using your
retirement account like a piggy bank could make your so-called
golden years not so golden.
 While the loan is unpaid, your retirement account earns less
tax-deferred interest. Therefore, there is less money in the
account when you retire.
 If your employer matches the contributions you make to your
retirement plan, those contributions may end while you’re
repaying the loan. This also means less money for your 
retirement.
 Your employer may charge you a steep loan application fee —
a couple hundred dollars or more. The fee increases the total
cost of the loan.
Chapter 7: Consolidating Your Debts 105

 If you leave your job before you’ve paid off the loan — 
regardless of whether you leave because you found a better
job, you were fired or laid off, or your employer went belly 
up — your employer will probably require that you repay the
full amount of your outstanding loan balance within a very
short period of time, somewhere between 30 and 90 days. If
you can’t come up with the bucks, the IRS will treat the unpaid
money as an early withdrawal for tax purposes, and you’ll also
have to pay the 10 percent early withdrawal penalty.
Use the online calculator at www.bankrate.com/brm/calc/401kl.
asp to figure out whether borrowing from your 401(k) is a good
idea.
If you are younger than 591⁄2, you may qualify for an early hardship
withdrawal from your 401(k), even if your plan does not permit you
to borrow from it. A withdrawal differs from a loan because you
take the money out of your account without the option of repaying
it. Therefore, you are permanently reducing the amount of money
you’ll have for your retirement. To be eligible for a hardship with-
drawal, you must prove to your employer that you have “an imme-
diate and heavy financial need” and that you’ve exhausted all other
financial avenues for handling the need. Although your employer
determines what constitutes “an immediate and heavy financial
need,” avoiding an eviction or foreclosure or paying steep medical
bills almost certainly qualifies. You have to pay federal taxes on
the money you take out for the year in which you get the money,
and you also have to pay a 10 percent early withdrawal penalty.
There’s no free lunch in life, is there!
Avoiding Dangerous Debt
Consolidation Possibilities
When your debts are creating a lot of stress, your judgment may get
clouded. You may start grasping at straws and do something really
stupid that you would never do if you were thinking clearly — like
fall for one of the many debt consolidation offers out there that are
outrageously expensive and maybe even scams. Here are some of
the worst offenders to avoid:
 Debt counseling firms that promise to lend you money to
help pay off your debts. If you get a loan from one of these
outfits, it will not only have a high interest rate, but you may
have to secure the loan with your home. Watch out! In
Chapter 8, we tell you how to find a reputable nonprofit coun-
seling agency that can help you deal with your debts. That
Part II: Going on a Debt Diet 
106

chapter also explains how to avoid agencies that pretend to
be nonprofits.
 Finance company loans: These companies often use advertis-
ing to make their debt consolidation loans sound like the
answer to your prayers. They are not. Finance company loans
typically have high rates of interest and exorbitant fees. As if
that’s not bad enough, working with a finance company will
further damage your credit history.
 Lenders who promise you a substantial loan (probably more
than you can afford to repay), no questions asked, in
exchange for your paying them a substantial upfront fee: No
reputable lender will make such a promise. Not only will these
disreputable lenders charge you a high percentage rate on the
borrowed money; they will also put a lien on your home or on
another asset you don’t want to lose.
 Companies that promise to negotiate a debt consolidation
loan for you and to use the proceeds to pay off your credi-
tors: In turn, they tell you to begin sending them money each
month to repay the loan. The problem with many of these
companies is that they never get you a loan or pay off your
creditors. You send the company money every month while
your credit history is being damaged even more, and you’re
being charged interest and late fees on your unpaid debts.

F
eeling overwhelmed by your debts and unsure how to take
control of your finances despite the advice you’ve read in this
book so far? Have you tried without success to pursue the self-help
options we discuss in other chapters? Take heart; there is a calm
port in the storm called a credit counseling agency. Among other
services, the agency can help you develop a budget and figure out
a way to deal with your debts.
The benefits of credit counseling presume that you work with a
reputable, nonprofit credit counseling agency that employs trained
and certified credit counselors and that charges fairly for its serv-
ices. Many credit counseling agencies talk a good game and have
impressive Web sites, but they charge an arm and a leg for their
services and deliver little in return. If you work with one of them,
your finances could end up worse, not better. Yikes!
If you’re in the market for credit counseling, this chapter is for you.
We give you the information you need to locate a reputable organi-
zation. We explain how good credit counseling agencies operate,
and we provide you with a set of questions to ask before you agree
to work with an agency. We also give you the lowdown on debt
management plans in case a credit counseling agency suggests that
it set one up for you, and we tell you how to get the most benefit
from such a plan.

We also illuminate the dangers of working with a debt settlement
firm: a firm that agrees to settle your debts for less than what you
owe on them. Some consumers confuse debt settlement for credit
counseling; we explain how they differ. Finally, we tell you what to
do if you are ripped off by a credit counseling agency or a debt set-
tlement firm.
Finding a Reputable Credit
Counseling Agency
A reputable credit counseling agency evaluates your finances and
comes up with a plan for helping you get out of debt and avoid
financial problems in the future. Among other things, the agency
 Reviews your budget to make sure it is realistic and sug-
gests improvements and/or additional cuts. If you do not
already have a budget, the agency helps you develop one.
 Assesses the state of your finances. After reviewing your
financial information, the agency gives you a realistic picture
of where you are right now financially: no better or worse off
than a lot of consumers, on the brink of bankruptcy, or some-
where in between.
 Figures out how you can keep up with your debts. The agency
may revise your budget in order to generate more cash flow
(the amount of money you have to spend) each month so 
you can pay your debts off faster. Or it may recommend 
that you participate in a debt management plan in order 
to lower your monthly debt payments to amounts you can
afford. If your finances are in really bad shape, the agency may
suggest that you meet with a consumer bankruptcy attorney.
If the credit counseling agency advises you to pay off your
debts through a debt management plan, the agency will
explain how the plan works and review its pluses and
minuses. Also, the agency should give you a general idea of
how much you’ll have to pay on your debts each month if it
sets up a debt management plan for you.
When a credit counseling agency sets up a debt management
plan for you, the plan will address your unsecured debts, like
credit card debts, unpaid medical bills, and student loans.
Most credit counseling agencies will not help you with your
secured debts, such as your mortgage, home equity loan, and
car loan. In Chapters 10 and 11, we help you figure out what to
do about your mortgage and your car loans when you can’t
keep up with them.
Part II: Going on a Debt Diet

 Helps you set financial goals and provides you with finan-
cial education. The financial education may include work-
shops and seminars on various aspects of money
management, as well as brochures and workbooks.
Telling the good from the bad
Most credit counseling agencies are truly interested in helping con-
sumers get a handle on their debts and develop a solid foundation
for a financially sound future. However, some agencies are mostly
out to make a buck (or lots of bucks) off consumers who are des-
perate for help and unaware of the differences between reputable
and disreputable credit counseling agencies.
Sadly, consumers who work with a bad apple agency are apt to pay
it a lot of money — money they could have used to pay their debts
or their living expenses — and get little or nothing in return. In
fact, many of these consumers end up worse off financially than
they were before. For example, bad apple credit counseling agen-
cies may charge excessive fees, push consumers into debt manage-
ment plans when they don’t need them (so the agencies can charge
plan administration fees each month), and offer no financial educa-
tion or goal-setting assistance.
That’s the bad news. The good news is that it’s relatively easy to
find a good credit counseling agency, assuming that you know the
questions to ask and the telltale signs that an agency may not be
on the up and up.
If an agency’s promises about what it can do for you sound too good
to be true, watch out! No matter how much you may want to believe
what it says, look for another credit counseling agency to work with.
Avoid credit counseling agencies that solicit your business by
phone or e-mail. Also, don’t be impressed by agencies that spend
money on glossy print ads and regular ads on TV or radio.
Reputable organizations do not spend a lot of money on advertis-
ing and rely mostly on referrals and word of mouth.
Locating agencies in your area
When you look for a credit counseling agency to work with, check
out a couple so you can feel confident that you are going to get
good help. Ask friends or relatives who have had a good past expe-
rience with credit counseling for a referral. Don’t know anyone
who’s worked with this kind of agency? Here are two other excel-
lent resources for finding a good one:
Chapter 8: Using Credit Counseling to Get a Grip on Your Finances 111

 The National Foundation for Credit Counseling: www.nfcc.
org or 800-388-2227
 The Association of Independent Consumer Credit
Counseling Agencies: www.aiccca.org or 800-450-1794
The counselors who work for credit counseling agencies that are
affiliated with these two organizations are trained and certified.
Another excellent source of reputable credit counseling agencies is
the Web site of the United States Trustee. These days, people who
want to file for bankruptcy have to obtain a certificate to file from a
credit counseling agency. Only credit counseling agencies that
have been certified by the federal Trustee’s office can issue this
type of certificate. We think it’s safe to assume that the certified
agencies are reputable. To find a certified credit counseling agency
in your state, go to www.usdoj.gov/ust and click on “Credit
Counseling and Debtor Education.”
If you don’t find credit counseling agencies in your area, or if you
will have a difficult time going to a credit counseling agency’s office
during business hours, many good agencies offer online counseling
that can be just as effective as meeting face to face with a credit
counselor. However you choose to get the counseling, your
method of selecting a credit counselor and your expectations
should be the same.
Knowing what to ask and 
the answers to expect
After you have the names of some agencies, ask each the following
set of questions by meeting with a representative from each
agency, e-mailing them from their Web sites, or talking with them
on the phone. Do not pay a credit counseling agency any money or
sign any paperwork until you have received satisfactory answers
to each of these questions:
 Are you a federally approved, nonprofit, tax-exempt credit
counseling agency? Nonprofit agencies will charge you the
least for their services and provide you with the most in
return. Some credit counseling organizations are for-profit
businesses even though their names make them sound like
they are nonprofits.
Get proof that a credit counseling agency is truly a nonprofit
by asking for a copy of its IRS approval of nonprofit status letter.
The letter is a one-page document. Don’t work with an agency
that refuses to let you look at this letter or never provides it.
Part II: Going on a Debt Diet 
112

 Do you have a license to offer credit counseling services in
my state? Although some states do not license credit counsel-
ing organizations, many do. You can find out if your state
requires licensing by contacting your state attorney general’s
office. If your state does issue licenses, ask for the name of the
licensing agency and then get in touch with it to confirm that
the credit counseling agency has a valid license.
 What services do you offer? The upcoming section “Working
with a Credit Counselor” describes the services the agency
should offer.
 How do you charge for your services? Reputable credit
counseling agencies charge little or nothing for most of their
services. However, if you participate in a debt management
plan, you will be charged a small monthly administrative 
fee — probably $40 per month tops. Less reputable agencies
charge substantial upfront fees — as much as several hundred
dollars — as well as steep monthly fees if they put you in a
debt management plan.
Some credit counseling agencies that are not on the up and up
don’t charge large fees but charge a lot of small fees instead.
Over time, all those small fees really add up. Ask the credit
counseling agency for a comprehensive list of fees. If it refuses
to provide a list or tells you it does not have one, steer clear!
Some states regulate the amount of money a credit counseling
agency can charge to set up a debt management plan and to
administer it. Contact your state attorney general’s office to
find out if it regulates these fees.
Watch out for credit counseling agencies that encourage you
to give them voluntary contributions. The contributions are
nothing more than fees to make the agencies more money at
your expense.
 Will I be assigned a specific credit counselor to work with?
You should expect to work with one credit counselor.
 How do you pay your credit counselors? Reputable agencies
pay their counselors a salary or pay them by the hour. Avoid
agencies where the credit counselors make money by selling
services to consumers. The counselors are nothing more than
commissioned sales people who have a financial incentive to
get you to buy as many services as possible whether you
need them or not.
 Can I see a copy of the contract I must sign if I work with
you? Don’t work with an agency that does not use a contract
or that won’t share a copy with you. The contract should
clearly state exactly what services the agency will be provid-
ing to you, a timeline for those services, and any fees or
Chapter 8: Using Credit Counseling to Get a Grip on Your Finances 113

expenses you must pay. It should also provide information
about any guarantees the credit counseling agency is making
to you, as well as the name of the credit counselor you’ll be
working with and the counselor’s contact information.
 How will you keep my personal and financial information
private and secure? With identity theft on the rise, you must
feel confident that the agency has a strong policy in place to
protect your information from strangers.
After you find an agency you’d like to work with, check it out with
your local Better Business Bureau and with your state attorney
general’s office. If either organization indicates that numerous con-
sumers have filed complaints against the agency, reconsider your
decision.
You should also check with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at
www.ftc.gov or by calling 877-382-4857. The FTC is aggressively
cracking down on businesses that pretend to be nonprofit credit
counseling agencies.
Working with a Credit Counselor
After you have chosen a credit counseling agency, your assigned
credit counselor will spend time becoming familiar with you and
your finances. If you meet face to face with the counselor, you
should expect your initial meeting to last about an hour, and you
should expect to have a couple follow-up meetings. If you get your
counseling online, you will exchange information and get your
questions answered via e-mail.
Sharing your financial situation
At your first meeting (or soon after), be prepared to provide your
counselor with such information as
 Your household budget, if you have one
 A list of your debts, including whether they are secured or
unsecured (see Chapter 4)
 The amount of money due on each debt every month
 The interest rate for each debt
 Which debts you are behind on
Part II: Going on a Debt Diet 
114

 The assets you own and their approximate market values
(meaning how much you could sell them for)
 Copies of your most recent tax returns or pay stubs reflecting
your monthly take-home pay
The counselor uses all this information to prepare a get-out-of-debt
plan that is customized just for you. Not only will the plan provide
you with a road map for getting out of debt; it should also help you
work toward your financial goals like buying a home, saving for
your retirement, helping your children pay for their college educa-
tions, and so on.
As part of your plan, the credit counselor may suggest that you
enroll in one or more of the agency’s money management seminars
and workshops so you can gain the information and tools you need
to avoid debt problems in the future and achieve your financial
goals. The seminars and workshops may focus on topics like smart
budgeting, managing debt, financial goal setting, and so on. Also, the
counselor may give you free money management materials to read.
Whittling down your debt with a
debt management plan
If your counselor is unable to figure out a way for you to pay off
your debts by reducing your expenses and maybe making more
money, the counselor may recommend that you participate in a
debt management plan. When you participate in such a plan, the
counselor tries to negotiate smaller monthly payments with your
creditors.
Getting creditors to buy in
The counselor determines exactly how much you can afford to pay
to your unsecured creditors each month in order to eliminate each
debt over a three- to five-year period. Then the counselor contacts
the creditors to find out if they will agree to let you pay the amounts
you can afford. In some instances, the counselor may also ask the
creditors for other concessions, such as lowering your interest rates
and reducing or waiving any fees you may owe to them.
If your unsecured creditors believe that giving you what you need
is their best shot at getting the money you owe, and if they believe
you are likely to file for bankruptcy otherwise (which means they
may not get a penny from you), they will probably agree to the
Chapter 8: Using Credit Counseling to Get a Grip on Your Finances 115

plan the credit counselor has proposed. However, most large credi-
tors will have a minimum amount that they expect you to pay on
your debts each month; unless you commit to paying it, they won’t
agree to participate in your plan. If some of your creditors refuse
to work with you, you have to continue paying them according to
the original agreements with them.
Many creditors are willing to offer special concessions to con-
sumers who pay off their debts through a debt management plan.
In return, they expect that consumers will not incur additional
debt while they are in their plans.
Working the plan
After the credit counselor has prepared your final debt manage-
ment plan, ask for a copy. Do not sign it until you have read it care-
fully, understand everything in it, and are sure that you can live up
to it. Note any restrictions in the plan. For example, it may prohibit
you from taking on additional credit with your current creditors or
applying for new credit while it is in effect. If you violate any aspect
of your plan, you risk having it cancelled.
When your plan is official, you pay your credit counselor every
month the amount of money you have agreed to pay on your
debts, as well as the required monthly fee. In turn, the counselor
pays your creditors.
Make sure your debt management plan says that your credit coun-
selor will send you regular monthly updates on the status of your
debt management plan, including confirmation that each of your
creditors was paid according to the terms of the plan.
Beware of credit counseling agencies that spend little or no time
evaluating your finances before advising you to enroll in a debt
management plan or that ask you to begin paying on a debt man-
agement plan before your creditors have agreed to work with you.
Also, be aware that some creditors who agree to be part of your
plan may report you as slow paying or as paying through a debt
management plan, which will damage your credit history a little.
However, statistics show that successfully completing a debt man-
agement plan actually increases your FICO score: the numeric rep-
resentation of your creditworthiness that is derived from the
information in your credit history. (For more information about
FICO scores, see Chapter 2.)

116

Actively managing your plan
Even when you are careful about choosing a credit counseling
agency to work with, if you participate in a debt management plan,
problems can develop that may undermine the plan benefits.
Follow these tips to minimize the potential for problems:
 After your counselor tells you which of your unsecured credi-
tors have agreed to participate in your debt management
plan, contact them to confirm their participation before you
send the counselor any money.
However, taking this step before paying any money may not
always be possible. Due to cost constraints, a nonprofit credit
counseling agency may not contact your creditors to find out
if they will participate in your debt management plan until
you have given the agency an initial month’s payment on the
plan. The agency wants to be sure that you are serious about
paying your debts before it spends time negotiating the plan
details with your creditors.
 If your counselor tells you that one of your creditors won’t
agree to participate in your plan until you send the counselor
an upfront payment, contact the creditor to confirm that what
the counselor says is true.
 Make sure that the schedule your counselor sets up for paying
your debts provides enough time for your creditors to receive
what they are owed each month before the payment due dates.
Otherwise, you risk racking up late fees and penalties.
 Every month, just after the date that your counselor is due to
make a payment, confirm with the counselor that the payment
was made on time.
 Whenever you receive a monthly statement of your account
from one of the creditors participating in your debt manage-
ment plan, review it carefully to make sure your account was
credited appropriately. Also, make sure that each creditor
made whatever concessions it agreed to make, such as lower-
ing your interest rate, waiving certain fees, or allowing you to
make reduced payments or interest-only payments for a while.
Avoiding Debt Settlement Firms
Some people confuse debt settlement firms, also known as debt
negotiation firms, with credit counseling agencies. Don’t make this
mistake. Although a debt settlement firm may try to confuse you
by choosing a name that sounds like a nonprofit credit counseling
agency, debt settlement companies are in business to make money.
Chapter 8: Using Credit Counseling to Get a Grip on Your Finances 117

The services they offer are very different from those of a legitimate
credit counseling agency. Also, if you work with a debt settlement
firm, you risk harming your finances and damaging your credit his-
tory and your FICO score.
Being wary of false promises
Debt settlement firms claim that they can settle your unsecured
debts for less than the full amount you owe on them. In other
words, after you pay the settlement amounts, your creditors will
consider the debts to be paid in full. For example, if you owe
$10,000 in credit card debt, a debt settlement firm may tell you that
it can get the creditor to agree to let you pay the debt off for $6,000.
You can try to settle your own debts, for free. You don’t need a
debt settlement firm to do it for you. In Chapter 6, we tell you how
to negotiate with your creditors.
(But keep in mind that if a creditor agrees to forgive part of your
debt, the IRS will probably treat that forgiven amount as income to
you, and you will be taxed on it. If you receive an IRS 1099 form
related to a debt that you settled, talk to a CPA. If the CPA can prove
that you were insolvent at the time that the amount of the debt was
forgiven, you won’t be taxed on that amount. You’re insolvent if you
don’t have enough money to pay your debts and living expenses
and you don’t have any assets you can sell to pay off the debts.)
Some debt settlement firms also promise that after they settle your
debts, they can get all the negative information related to those
debts removed from your credit history. Not true! Only the credi-
tors that reported the negative information can remove it.
If you agree to work with a debt settlement firm, you may be told
to stop paying your unsecured creditors and to begin sending that
money to the firm itself. The problem is that a debt settlement firm
may be all talk and no action. It may not be able to settle your
debts for less. In fact, it may not even try. Furthermore, if it does
intend to try to settle your debts, it may take months for the firm
to accumulate enough money from the payments you are sending
to be able to propose settlements to your creditors. Meanwhile,
your debts are going unpaid, your credit history is being damaged
further, and the total amount you owe to your creditors is increas-
ing because late fees and interest are accumulating.
If you question a debt settlement firm about the consequences of
not paying your debts, you may hear that your unsecured credi-
tors won’t sue you for their money. That is flat-out wrong.
Part II: Going on a Debt Diet 
118

Preventing worse financial problems
Debt settlement firms charge much more money than legitimate
credit counseling agencies. If you work with a debt settlement firm,
you may have to pay one or more substantial upfront fees, as well
as additional fees that may be based on the number of unsecured
credit accounts you have, the amount of debt you owe, or the
amount of debt that the firm gets your creditors to forgive. In the
end, the cost of working with a debt management firm may be
more than the amount of money you save from settling your debts.
Be careful if a debt settlement firm offers to loan you money,
maybe more than you can really afford to pay. Not only is the loan
likely to have a very high interest rate and other unattractive
terms of credit, but if you are not careful, you may sign paperwork
giving the firm the right to put a lien on an asset you own. The firm
is hoping that you’ll fall behind on your loan payments so it can
take the asset from you.
Getting Relief If You 
Get Ripped Off
If you get taken by a disreputable credit counseling organization or
by a debt settlement firm, contact a consumer law attorney right
away. The attorney will advise you of your rights. He may recom-
mend sending a letter on his law firm stationery to the credit coun-
seling organization or debt settlement firm threatening legal action
unless the firm makes amends to you (such as by giving you your
money back). The credit counseling organization or debt settle-
ment firm may agree to the attorney’s demands in order to avoid a
lawsuit. If it does not respond or refuses to do what the letter asks,
you can decide if you want to go forward with a lawsuit.
Assuming that you have a strong case, the attorney will probably
represent you on a contingent fee basis. This means that you won’t
have to pay the attorney any money to represent you. Instead, the
attorney gambles that you will win your lawsuit, and the attorney
will take his fee from the money that the court awards you as a
result. If you lose your lawsuit, you do not have to pay the attorney
a fee. However, depending on your agreement with one another,
win or lose, you may have to pay the attorney’s court costs and
any other fees and expenses related to your case.
Chapter 8: Using Credit Counseling to Get a Grip on Your Finances 119

Regardless of whether you sue the credit counseling organization
or debt settlement firm, you should file a complaint against it with
your state attorney general’s office, your local Better Business
Bureau, and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Although none
of these organizations can help you get your money back or undo
any damage done to your credit history and your FICO score, other
consumers who may be thinking about working with the same
credit counseling agency or debt settlement firm may think twice
after reading your complaint. Also, if your state attorney general’s
office or the FTC receives a lot of complaints about the credit
counseling agency or debt settlement firm, it may take legal action
against it. For example, it may file a class action lawsuit on behalf
of everyone who was ripped off.

Dealing with Debt Collectors
In This Chapter

 Standing up for your rights
D
ebt collector. If you’ve ever been contacted by one (or heard
horror stories from people who have), just reading those two
words may give you a queasy feeling in the pit of your stomach.
Even dealing with relatively friendly and polite debt collectors can
be downright intimidating. And if you’ve ever had the misfortune
to be contacted by aggressive, high-pressure debt collectors, you
know all too well that they are willing to harass and threaten you
with all sorts of dire consequences, like jail time, in an effort to get
you to pay up.
This chapter arms you with the information and the tools you need
to take control when debt collectors come calling. The goal is to
ensure that they don’t make your life totally miserable or pressure
you into paying debts you really can’t afford to pay. We explain
how debt collectors operate so you understand why they act the
way they do, what the law says debt collectors can and can’t do in
order to collect money from you, and some disturbing new trends
in debt collection that it pays to know about.
The chapter also spells out your debt collection rights and your
options for responding to a debt collector’s demands, including
meeting with a consumer law attorney — something that we fre-
quently advise you do. Many debt collectors have become so
aggressive and brazen that even when you let them know they
have violated your rights, they keep on violating them. Therefore,
we believe that you must arm yourself with the information in this
chapter and consult with a consumer law attorney. Otherwise,
aggressive, arrogant debt collectors are going to victimize you.

You probably won’t have to pay a consumer law attorney any
money to represent you if you’ve got a strong case against a debt
collector because the attorney will charge on a contingent fee basis.
In other words, the attorney takes his fee out of whatever money
the court awards you if you win your lawsuit and gets no fee at all
if you lose. Even better, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the
federal law that regulates the activities of debt collectors, says that
if you win the lawsuit, the debt collector must pay your attorney’s
fees.
Understanding How Debt
Collectors Operate
When you fall behind on the payments you are obligated to make
to a creditor, you receive an increasingly serious-sounding series of
notices demanding payment. If you don’t pay, the creditor is likely
to turn your debt over to an outside debt collection agency. When
this happens, it won’t be long before a debt collector who works
for the agency contacts you.
First impressions
Some debt collectors are difficult and demanding right from the
start. Others may start out acting relatively friendly on the phone,
but if you do not agree to pay what you owe right away, they
ratchet up the pressure the next time they get in touch.
Some debt collectors have a deliberate strategy of starting out
being really friendly in order to encourage you to let your guard
down and say something that could help them collect from you.
Other debt collectors have the opposite strategy; they are aggres-
sive and insulting from the get-go. They want to make you cry or
feel so guilty about owing money that you will agree to pay your
debt regardless of whether doing so is a wise financial move.
Why are debt collectors generally so unpleasant and pushy? Most
are paid according to how much they collect, usually on a percent-
age basis. In other words, the more money they collect, the more
money they make. Other debt collectors are paid according to the
number of collection calls they place or the number of demand let-
ters they send out, another method that provides them a financial
incentive to be persistent, pushy, or even worse. Still others don’t
work for creditors at all; they buy creditors’ old debts, often at a
discount. Then the debt collectors try to make a profit by collect-
ing as much as possible as quickly as possible.

122

Debt collectors also know that statistically, the longer a debt goes
unpaid, the less likely it is that they will ever collect it. This knowl-
edge motivates them to start out strong and also encourages them
to create a false sense of urgency when they talk to you. For exam-
ple, they may pressure you to commit to paying your debt by a
specific deadline or according to a very short timetable. If you
don’t agree to their demands, they may try to scare you into capit-
ulating by threatening you with a lawsuit, the loss of your personal
property, the garnishment or seizing of all your income, even jail
time — regardless of whether these consequences are likely to
happen or are even legal. In the upcoming section “What debt col-
lectors can do,” we review exactly what actions debt collectors can
take if you don’t pay a debt and under what circumstances.
What debt collectors can’t do
Knowledge is power, and that truth certainly applies to dealing
with debt collectors. Knowing how they operate and what they can
and can’t do to collect a debt from you should make it easier to
deal with them and help protect you from their bluster, bullying,
and threats.
The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) is the federal law
that applies to debt collection. It clearly states what debt collec-
tors cannot do in order to collect money from consumers. The law
applies to the collection of personal, household, and family debts
like your mortgage and car loan, other personal loans, your credit
card debts, past-due utility bills, past-due student loans, medical
and insurance debts, condo fees, unpaid legal judgments against
you, and bounced checks.
The FDCPA applies to outside debt collectors but not to a credi-
tor’s own in-house debt collectors (meaning debt collectors who
are employees of a creditor). However, if your state has its own
debt collection law, it may cover in-house as well as outside debt
collectors. The FDCPA also governs the debt collection activities of
attorneys who collect debts for their clients, but it does not apply
to employees of federal and state agencies who collect debts for
those agencies.
If your state has its own law that applies to debt collectors, it may
be tougher and more comprehensive than the federal law. Contact
your state attorney general’s office to find out if your state has a
law and about the protections it provides you.
Debt collectors who are covered by the FDCPA cannot do any of
the following to collect a debt from you:
Chapter 9: Dealing with Debt Collectors 123

 Call you before 8 a.m. or after 9 p.m. unless you tell them it is
okay to do so. Also, they cannot contact you at any time that
you indicate is inconvenient. For example, if you work the
night shift and normally sleep from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., you can
tell debt collectors not to call you during those hours. If they
do, they are breaking the law.
In fact, you don’t have to talk to debt collectors any time of
the day or night if you don’t want to. To put an end to their
calls, the FDCPA entitles you to tell debt collectors not to call
you again. If you say “Stop,” they must stop.
 Call you on a Sunday.
 Contact you at work if the debt collector knows that your
employer does not want you to be contacted there during
working hours.
 Get in touch with your employer about a debt you owe, unless
the debt is past-due child support.
 Contact your relatives, friends, or neighbors about the money
you owe in order to embarrass you into paying your debts.
Debt collectors can contact these people to obtain informa-
tion about how to contact you, such as your address or phone
number, but they are not permitted to say why they want that
information.
 Communicate with you about your debt by using a postcard or
an envelope that clearly indicates that a debt collector sent it.
 Use a letter or envelope to communicate with you that
appears to have come from a government agency or a court.
 Call you over and over again during a relatively short period
of time. For example, they cannot call you repeatedly during a
single morning or afternoon or call you day after day. Such
behavior is harassment, and the FDCPA makes harassment
illegal.
 Swear or insult you when you are having a conversation, or
threaten you with the loss of your reputation or with jail time.
However, debt collectors can threaten you with specific con-
sequences if you don’t pay what you owe, assuming that the
consequences are legal and that they intend to make good on
their threats. For example, they can threaten to garnish your
wages unless your state prohibits it, or to take an asset that
you own if they are legally entitled to take it. Again, it pays to
know your state laws; your state may have a law that protects
you from the loss of your home unless you have failed to keep
up with your mortgage.
 Order you to accept collect calls from them.
Part II: Going on a Debt Diet 
124

 Deposit a post-dated check you have given them before the
date on the check.
 Collect more than you owe on a debt, unless the contract you
have with the creditor that turned your debt over to collec-
tions allows the debt collector to do that.
As soon as a debt collector does anything that violates the FDCPA
and/or your state debt collection law, begin keeping a detailed
record of exactly what the debt collector did, including the date
and time of each illegal action. Also, save all correspondence you
receive from a debt collector, including envelopes. This informa-
tion can be invaluable if you meet with a consumer law attorney
and the attorney advises that you sue the debt collector.
Some debt collectors are so aggressive that when you tell them
they have broken the law or threaten to sue you, they adopt a “So
what?” attitude and just continue the same behavior. The only
effective way to deal with them is to get in touch with a consumer
law attorney.
What debt collectors can do
Some debt collectors harass and threaten people with dire conse-
quences to get them to pay their debts. But in reality, if a debt col-
lector is trying to collect an unsecured debt (one not collateralized
with an asset), such as a credit card debt, medical bill, or small
personal loan, he is quite limited in terms of the legal actions he
can take to collect from you. This is important information to have
when you are deciding how best to respond to a debt collector’s
demands. In the next section, we review various ways you can
respond to a debt collector when he tries to get you to pay a past-
due unsecured debt.
If the debt is secured, the story is quite different. A secured debt is
one collateralized with an asset that you own, like your mortgage
and your car loan; you could lose that asset if you do not take care
of the debt. Part III of this book zeros in on the collection of
secured debts like your home mortgage and car loan, as well as
other high-stake debts. The rest of this chapter focuses on the col-
lection of unsecured debts.
If the amount of your debt is relatively small, the debt collector is
likely to give up trying to collect it if you don’t agree to pay what
you owe right away. Most debt collectors are paid based on the
amount of money they collect. When it becomes apparent that col-
lecting from you is going to take time and effort, they are likely to
move on to greener pastures. However, you don’t get off scot-free:
Chapter 9: Dealing with Debt Collectors 125

The fact that the debt was sent to collections and remains unpaid
will further damage your credit history and your credit score.
Debt collectors will go to considerable lengths to collect large
debts. In fact, they may sue you in order to try to collect the
money you owe. If a debt collector sues you, you will be notified of
the lawsuit via a summons, which tells you why you are being sued
and for how much, who sued you, and on what date you must
appear in court.
Get in touch with a consumer law attorney as soon as you receive
a summons. The attorney may be able to negotiate a settlement
with the debt collector, which would bring an end to the lawsuit
and mean that you avoid the costs of a trial. If the negotiations are
unsuccessful, the attorney can represent you in court. Trying to
defend yourself is foolhardy.
Should the debt collector win the lawsuit, the judge awards him a
certain amount of money. However, the debt collector cannot col-
lect the money from you right away. Instead, he must get the
court’s permission to take specific actions in order to try to collect
from you. For example, the debt collector may ask the court for
permission to
 Garnish your wages if wage garnishment is legal in your
state. (It is not legal in Pennsylvania, South Carolina, or
Texas.) If the court gives the debt collector permission to gar-
nish your wages, it will issue an order requiring your
employer to withhold a certain amount of money from each of
your paychecks for a set period of time. That money goes
toward paying down your debt.
If the debt collector is trying to collect unpaid child support
that a court ordered you to pay, a past-due federal student
loan, or unpaid taxes that you owe to the IRS, the debt collec-
tor may get permission to garnish a portion of a pension you
may be receiving and even some of your monthly Social
Security income. Under certain circumstances, a portion of
your Social Security income can also be garnished to pay
past-due spousal support.
 Take one or more of your assets. If a debt collector gets per-
mission to take an asset that you own, such as a boat or
motorcycle or real estate other than your home, the asset is
sold in a public auction and the proceeds are applied to your
debt. If the proceeds are not enough to pay off the debt in full,
the debt collector is entitled to try to collect the deficiency
amount from you.
Part II: Going on a Debt Diet 
126

 Put a judgment lien on one of your assets. When a lien is
placed on one of your assets, you cannot sell it or borrow
against it without paying the debt collector the money you
owe so the lien can be removed.
If you have no assets, and if your state does not permit wage gar-
nishment, you are judgment proof. In other words, a debt collector
can do nothing to collect the money you owe.
Depending on the amount of the debt you are being sued for, your
case may be heard in small claims court. The maximum amount
you can be sued for in a small claims court ranges widely from
state to state, from $1,500 to $15,000. When your case is heard in
small claims court, you may have to represent yourself because
many states do not allow attorneys in that kind of court. In that sit-
uation, we encourage you to consult with an attorney about how to
defend yourself.
Knowing Your Options When 
a Debt Collector Calls
The FDCPA gives you a number of different ways to respond to a
debt collector. In other words, you don’t have to pay a debt just
because a debt collector demands that you do.
The best option for you depends on a number of factors, including
the kind of debt the debt collector is trying to collect, your finan-
cial situation, and whether you agree that you owe the debt. If you
are not sure about how to respond to a debt collector, talk to a
consumer law attorney.
Never voluntarily offer information to a debt collector, and do not
allow yourself to be drawn into a conversation with one. The
FDCPA does not require that you provide any information to a debt
collector or answer any questions a debt collector may ask you. By
talking to a debt collector, you may unwittingly provide informa-
tion that she can use against you later. As they say, loose lips sink
ships! For example, never give a debt collector your bank account
numbers or any information about your assets.
When a debt collector calls you, ask him for his name and phone
number and tell him that you’ll call him right back. By doing so,
you gain time to collect your thoughts and decide how best to
respond to the debt collector. Plus, simply by placing the call,
you’re likely to feel more in control of the conversation.
Chapter 9: Dealing with Debt Collectors 127

Asking for proof
When a debt collector contacts you about a debt for the first time,
that person is legally obligated to send you a written statement
within five days indicating how much money you owe and to whom
you owe it. The notice must also inform you of your right to
request written verification of the debt and your right to dispute
the debt.
It’s a good idea to request verification of a debt, whether you are
sure that you owe it or not. If you know that you owe the money,
requesting verification buys you some time to figure out how to
deal with the debt. If you are not sure that the debt is yours or you
think that you owe less money than the debt collector wants you
to pay, you must ask that the debt be verified. Always put your veri-
fication request in writing, and ask the debt collector to respond to
you in writing. Ask the collector to verify not only the original
amount of the debt that is still owed, but also any interest, late
fees, and collection fees; ask him to itemize each amount instead of
presenting the debt as a lump sum.
According to the Federal Trade Commission, which enforces the
FDCPA, the number-one complaint it receives about debt collectors is
that they try to collect more money than the consumers really owe.
Make a copy of the letter for your files, and send the request via
certified mail with a return receipt requested. That way, you know
when the letter was received. If the debt collector never responds
with the verification, you have proof that the debt collector vio-
lated the FDCPA.
Some states limit the kinds of debt-related expenses a debt collec-
tor can charge consumers. Find out if your state has such limits by
getting in touch with your state attorney general’s office or with a
consumer law attorney. Also, the contract you signed with your
original creditor — the creditor who turned your debt over to a
collection agency or sold the debt to the agency — may limit the
fees that you can be charged. If you do not have a copy of the con-
tract, ask the debt collector for a copy. Get in touch with a con-
sumer law attorney if the debt collector does not respond to your
request or says he does not have a copy either.
If you are confused by the debt collector’s verification letter — for
example, the amount of money the debt collector says you owe is
expressed as a lump sum instead of being broken out — contact
him again in writing and ask for a clear explanation. If the debt col-
lector does not provide a clear explanation, get in touch with a
consumer law attorney.
Part II: Going on a Debt Diet 
128

Paying the debt
If you agree that you owe the amount a debt collector is trying to
collect, you may want to go ahead and pay it. However, don’t pay it
if doing so jeopardizes your ability to pay your high priority debts,
such as your car loan, your mortgage, or other secured debts.
Also, don’t pay it if doing so undermines your ability to cover your
basic living expenses, such as food, utilities, and medical insur-
ance. In Chapter 4, we explain how to distinguish between high and
low priority debts and expenses.
Do not let a debt collector guilt you into paying a debt that you
really can’t afford to pay. If you find yourself wanting to give in to
the demands of a debt collector because you feel guilty, end the
conversation right away so you can collect your emotions and
steel your resolve.
Negotiating a settlement
A debt collector may take a something is better than nothing atti-
tude and agree to let you clear up your debt by paying less than
the total amount you owe. If the collector recognizes that you
really can’t pay any more than what you are offering, he may settle
with you so he can earn at least some money for his efforts. If the
debt collector purchased your debt from the original creditor for
cents on the dollar, he can still make a profit if he collects at least
something from you quickly.
If you are considering filing for bankruptcy, you may want to break
our rule about not sharing any personal information with a debt
collector. If you mention bankruptcy to a debt collector, the threat
of that possibility may motivate him to settle your unsecured debt
for less than what you owe. The debt collector knows that after
you file for bankruptcy, he will likely get nothing from you.
If you don’t feel confident trying to negotiate your own debt settle-
ment agreement, hire a consumer law attorney to do it for you,
especially if the debt you owe is substantial.
Debt settlement can cause you to owe more in federal income
taxes because the amount that you don’t pay is reported to the IRS
as income. However, depending on the state of your finances when
you settle the debt, the IRS may decide that you are insolvent. If it
does, you won’t owe any federal taxes.
Chapter 9: Dealing with Debt Collectors 129

The fact that you settled a debt shows up as negative information
in your credit report because it indicates that you’ve had financial
problems. However, it also indicates that you took responsibility
for paying as much as you could on the debt, which may somewhat
offset the negatives. Also, your credit report will show that the set-
tled debt is not outstanding anymore, which is a good thing for
your credit history.
Sticking to your budget
Before you begin negotiating a settlement with the debt collector,
review your budget (see Chapter 4) so you have a clear idea
exactly how much you can afford to pay. Do not offer more than
you can afford.
When you know how much you can afford, begin your negotiations
by offering less. You never know; the debt collector may accept
your offer. If he doesn’t, you’ve got room to maneuver, and by
agreeing to pay more, you come across as reasonable and accom-
modating, which may work in your favor.
Before the debt collector agrees to begin negotiating with you, you
may be asked to provide information about your assets and your
debts, as well as your income and living expenses. Giving this
information to the debt collector is a double-edged sword; the debt
collector won’t negotiate with you unless you provide it, but you
are giving the collector valuable information he may use against
you to
 Pressure you into paying more than you feel comfortable
paying.
 Collect from you if you reach a payment plan agreement and
later default on it.
 Collect what you owe if you are unable to reach an agreement
with one another.
Any of these potential consequences is a very real danger, so do
not give any additional information to a debt collector without con-
sulting a consumer law attorney first.
When you negotiate with a debt collector, whether you are negoti-
ating a debt settlement agreement or a payment plan (which we
discuss in the upcoming section “Working out a payment plan”), do
not give him information such as your bank account numbers,
place of employment, or references. The debt collector can use
that information to help him collect money from you should your
negotiations not work out or should you reach an agreement and
then not be able to live up to it.
Part II: Going on a Debt Diet 
130

Cleaning up your credit history
As part of your negotiations, ask the debt collector to remove from
your credit records all negative information related to the settled
debt that has been added to your records since the debt was
turned over to him. (The debt collector cannot remove any nega-
tive information about your debt that was added to your credit
files when the debt was still with the creditor.) The debt collector
may scoff at your request, or he may agree to it. As they say, it
never hurts to ask.
If the debt collector claims he does not have authorization to get
information removed from your credit history and says that only
the creditor to whom you originally owed the debt can do so, ask
for the name and phone number of the person you should contact.
If this person agrees to your request, ask that the agreement be put
in writing. That way, if the creditor reneges on its promise, a con-
sumer law attorney may be able to pressure the creditor to make
good on your agreement. After reaching this type of agreement,
you need to check your credit histories (see Chapter 2) to make
sure that the negative information has been removed.
Putting the deal in writing
After you and the debt collector reach an agreement on a debt set-
tlement amount, get the details of the agreement in writing before
you give the collector any money. Otherwise, you risk paying the
money and then having the debt collector claim that there never
was a deal. It’s also a good idea to hire a consumer law attorney to
review the agreement so you can be certain it protects you and does
not have the potential to create problems for you down the road.
If the debt collector won’t put your agreement in writing, prepare
an agreement yourself, sign it, and send it to the debt collector via
certified mail, return receipt requested. That way, if you end up
suing the debt collector for failing to live up to the agreement, you
have a document that spells out exactly what the debt collector
promised to do.
At a minimum, your agreement should clearly state
 How much you have agreed to pay.
 Whether you will pay the settlement amount in a lump sum or
over time.
 When the lump sum is due, or when you will make each
smaller payment.
 How you will make the payment(s), such as via an electronic
bank transfer or with a cashier’s check. Avoid giving a debt
Chapter 9: Dealing with Debt Collectors 131

collector a personal check because some unscrupulous debt
collectors use the information on consumers’ checks to trans-
fer money out of their bank accounts.
 That the debt collector agrees to report to the credit bureaus
it works with that your debt has been “paid in full” as soon as
the debt collector receives the settlement amount from you.
 Any concessions that the debt collector has agreed to make.
 Under what conditions the agreement will have been
breached or broken, and the consequences of the breach. For
example, if you do not make your payments by the date
they’re due or if you don’t make them at all, you have
breached the agreement and the debt collector may be enti-
tled to cancel the agreement and begin trying to collect from
you all over again.
Do not sign the agreement until it reflects everything you agreed to
and unless you understand everything in it. After you sign the
agreement, make a copy for yourself and file it in a safe place. If
problems later develop with your agreement, you can share this
document with a consumer law attorney.
It’s a good idea to have a consumer law attorney review the debt
settlement agreement before you sign it to make sure that your
interests are well protected and that you are not creating any
potential problems for yourself in the future.
Getting right with the IRS and credit bureaus
When a debt collector agrees to settle a debt that you owe for less
than the full amount, the IRS looks at the amount you are not
paying as income to you. Therefore, if you settle a debt for at least
$600 less than what you owe on it, the debt collector may have to
file an IRS 1099-C. If so, the debt collector will send you a completed
copy of this form for your taxes. However, depending on your finan-
cial situation, you may not have to pay taxes on the income listed
on the form. Consult with a tax professional in this situation.
If the debt collector agrees that after you pay the settlement
amount he will report to the credit bureaus that your debt has
been paid in full, and/or if he agrees to get negative information
related to the collection account removed from your credit files,
order copies of those files about one month after you pay the set-
tlement amount. Review them to make sure that the debt collector
did what he promised to do. If he did not, you or a consumer law
attorney should send the debt collector a letter via certified mail,
return receipt requested, politely but firmly demanding that he live
up to the terms of your agreement. Attach a copy of the agreement
to the letter. Also, make a copy of the letter for your files.
Part II: Going on a Debt Diet 
132

Taking your case to the creditor
If the debt collector refuses to negotiate with you, or if the two of
you don’t see eye to eye on some aspect of the proposed settle-
ment, contact the creditor who turned your debt over to the debt
collector. Find out if the creditor may be willing to negotiate or
may see things a little more your way.
If you have proof that the debt collector violated your FDCPA
rights or that there is something wrong with the original agreement
between you and the creditor (the creditor violated your state’s
usury law by charging you too much interest or did not disclose all
the terms of credit associated with your debt, for example), the
creditor may want to settle with you in order to minimize the likeli-
hood that you may file a lawsuit. Of course, the creditor can settle
with you only if it has not sold your debt to a debt collector.
Working out a payment plan
If you can’t negotiate a debt settlement agreement that you can
afford, you can ask the debt collector to let you pay the full
amount of the debt over time in a series of payments. A reasonable
time to ask for will depend on the size of your debt. If it is a very
large debt, your payments could stretch out for years. However,
most debt collectors are going to want you to pay what you owe as
quickly as possible and may even try to pressure you into borrow-
ing money from a friend or relative to pay the debt off fast.
Review your budget first (see Chapter 4) to figure out how much
you can afford each month, and make sure that making the pay-
ments will not affect your ability to pay your priority debts and
your most important living expenses. As with a debt settlement
agreement, get all the details of your payment plan in writing
before you pay the debt collector any money.
As we mention in the previous section, never send a personal
check to a debt collector. Make any payments that you agree to
with a cashier’s check. That way, you keep your bank account
information private.
Disputing the debt
If you do not agree that you owe a debt at all, or if you disagree
with the amount of the debt, send the debt collector a letter dis-
puting it. You must send this letter within 30 days of the debt col-
lector’s initial contact with you. According to the FDCPA, after the
debt collector receives your letter, he must either provide you with
Chapter 9: Dealing with Debt Collectors 133

written proof of the debt or cease all communication with you.
Although the debt collector is not required to respond within a
specific period of time, you should expect that the response will be
timely. After all, the debt collector wants to collect from you as
quickly as possible; he probably won’t let a lot of time pass before
getting back to you.
As soon as you let a debt collector know that you dispute a debt,
the debt collector must report the debt as “in dispute” to the
credit bureaus it works with. If the debt collector does not do so,
he has broken the FDCPA, and you should contact a consumer law
attorney about what to do. The fact that your debt is in dispute
will remain in your credit history until the debt collector provides
you with proof that you owe it and that the amount of the debt is
accurate. It’s possible, therefore, that the “in dispute” information
could remain in your credit history for a couple months or even
longer if you don’t accept the debt collector’s initial proof.
Saying that you can’t pay
If you do not have the money to pay a debt in either a lump sum or
through a series of installments, or if you and the debt collector
cannot agree on a settlement amount, send the debt collector a
letter stating that you cannot afford to pay what you owe and you
do not want to be contacted again about it. Although it’s never a
good idea to not pay a debt that you owe, it may be your only real
option if your finances are in very bad shape. (See Chapter 4 for an
explanation of the debts you should always try to pay and the ones
that are less important when you cannot pay everything.)
The FDCPA says that after the debt collector receives your letter,
she must cease all communication with you other than to confirm
receipt of your letter or to let you know about an action she is
going to take to try to collect the money (such as suing you).
If the amount of the debt is relatively small, you may never hear
from the debt collector again. The same is true if the debt collector
determines that you are judgment proof, meaning you have no
assets that the debt collector can take and your state does not
permit wage garnishment.
Asking not to be contacted again
Even if you intend to pay a debt, you can send a debt collector a
letter stating that you do not want to be contacted again about it.
You may want to exercise this option because the debt collector
Part II: Going on a Debt Diet 
134

has been very difficult to deal with or simply because you do not
want to be contacted anymore about the money you owe.
Again, after the debt collector receives your letter, he cannot con-
tact you except to confirm receipt of your letter and to inform you
about any collection actions he intends to take. If the amount of
your debt is relatively small, you may never hear from the collec-
tor again. If the amount of the debt is substantial, the debt collec-
tor may decide to play hardball and sue you for the money.
Feeling Haunted by Old Debt
A dangerous new breed of debt collector is on the scene. These
people specialize in the collection of very old debts and often think
nothing of flagrantly breaking the law in order to make a buck. For
example, these debt collectors are
 Contacting consumers about debts that have been charged
off as uncollectible. When a creditor charges off a debt, that
essentially means, “I am not going to collect on this debt right
now, but I may decide to try to collect it later.” The creditor
may take this step because it thinks the amount of the debt is
too small to bother with or because the consumer who owes
it is judgment proof.
The creditor may decide to try to collect the debt later, maybe
even years after the consumer has forgotten all about it, or it
may sell the debt to a debt collector who specializes in col-
lecting very old debts. Debt collectors who buy old debts are
not breaking any laws unless they violate the FDCPA or your
state’s debt collection laws when they try to collect an old
debt.
When a debt collector purchases a very old debt that you
owe, he can find out how to contact you by working with a
skip tracing company that specializes in finding people, or he
can locate you via the Internet. Also, if the debt collector has
an account with a national credit bureau, he can obtain your
current address from your credit file.
 Trying to collect debts for which the statute of limitations
has expired. The statute of limitations is the amount of time
during which you can be sued for nonpayment of a debt. The
statute of limitations begins on the first day you miss a debt
payment, and it typically lasts between four and six years.
However, depending on your state and the type of debt, it
could be as short as 3 years or as long as 15 years. To find out
Chapter 9: Dealing with Debt Collectors 135

the statute of limitations on your past-due debts, speak to a
consumer law attorney in your state or contact your state
attorney general’s office. A debt collector is legally entitled to
collect a debt after the statute of limitations has run out on it;
however, the debt collector is breaking the law if he sues you
over the debt or threatens to sue you.
You can unintentionally reactivate the statute of limitations on
an old debt by telling a debt collector that you agree to pay
some money on the debt, even a very small amount like $5.
When the statute of limitations is reactivated, it starts running
all over again as though you just defaulted on the debt. Also,
in some legal jurisdictions you can restart the statute of limi-
tations on a very old debt simply by acknowledging that the
debt is yours.
After the statute of limitations is reactivated, you are at risk
for being sued by the debt collector. If he wins, the court may
give the debt collector permission to collect the money you
owe by seizing assets you own, putting a lien on an asset you
own, garnishing your wages, and so on.
 Telling credit bureaus that an old debt in your credit history
is a new debt. Most negative information can remain in your
credit history for only seven years and six months. Some debt
collectors take this unscrupulous and illegal step in order to
put pressure on you to pay the debt, promising that when you
do, they will get the new negative information removed.
Review your Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion credit histo-
ries every six months so you can spot problems and get them
cleared up (see Chapter 2). If you discover an old debt that
should no longer be reported in your credit report, dispute

Take those library fines seriously
In an effort to fill up their dwindling coffers without raising taxes or user fees, a
growing number of municipal governments, including county and local govern-
ments, are using debt collectors to collect consumers’ unpaid library fines, parking
tickets, fees for animal services (like rabies tags), ambulance fees, and the like when
their own collection efforts have been unsuccessful. If your local or county gov-
ernment hires a debt collector to try to collect a $10 past-due library fine or a 
$15 past-due parking ticket from you, the impact on your credit record and credit
score is the same as if you had defaulted on a loan. In other words, it will be one
more negative in your credit history, and it will bring down your credit score.

the debt with the credit bureau that prepared the report fol-
lowing the directions that should have come with it. If you are
not able to resolve the error yourself, get in touch with a 
consumer law attorney who has specific experience dealing
with credit record problems.
If a debt collector violates your legal rights when he contacts you
about a debt that has been charged off or for which the statute of
limitations has expired, get in touch with a consumer law attorney
right away. You should do the same if a debt collector tries to get
away with reporting to the credit bureaus that one of your old
debts is new. Don’t let the debt collector get away with any illegal
actions. Stand up for your rights! The last section of this chapter
explains how a consumer law attorney can help you and highlights
other actions you can take when your debt collection rights are
violated.
Taking Action When a Debt
Collector Violates Your Rights
Debt collectors who flaunt the law deserve to be punished for 
their bad behavior. Even if a debt collector violates the law in a 
relatively minor way, you should take action by filing formal com-
plaints against the debt collector with the appropriate government
offices and by scheduling an appointment with a consumer law
attorney to discuss your legal options. Unless you let the debt col-
lector know you mean business, the violations will likely continue
and escalate. Taking such action doesn’t just provide you with a
sense of justice; it can help ensure that the debt collector does not
harm other consumers.
Complaining to the Federal 
Trade Commission
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has responsibility for enforc-
ing the FDCPA. Whenever a debt collector violates that law, you
should file a complaint with the FTC. Although the FTC will not go
after the debt collector on the basis of your complaint alone, if it
receives enough complaints about debt collectors working for the
same company, it will sue the company. Your complaint can help
the FTC build its legal case.
Chapter 9: Dealing with Debt Collectors 137

You can file your FTC complaint online at www.ftc.gov. You can
also register your complaint by calling the FTC at 800-382-4357, or
you can write to the FTC at Federal Trade Commission, Consumer
Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC
20580.
Be as specific as possible about how and when the debt collector
violated your legal rights. If you have any documentation that
helps prove the violation, mail your complaint to the FTC and
attach copies of the documentation to the letter.
You should also send a copy of your complaint to the debt collec-
tor. Just knowing that you have contacted the FTC may be all it
takes to convince the debt collector to stop the illegal behavior.
Contacting your state attorney 
general’s office
If your state has a law that applies to debt collectors, file a com-
plaint about the debt collector with your state attorney general’s
office. Your attorney general’s office won’t sue a debt collector on
your behalf alone, but your complaint may help the office build a
legal case against a debt collection company.
Consulting a consumer law attorney
Do not hesitate to make an appointment with a consumer law
attorney as soon as a debt collector violates your federal or state
debt collection legal rights. If the lawyer agrees that your rights
have been violated, and depending on the severity of the violation,
the attorney may suggest sending a letter to the debt collector
warning that if the behavior continues, you will file a lawsuit.
Sometimes, a sternly worded letter from an attorney is all it takes
to make a debt collector obey the law.
If the debt collector’s behavior has been especially egregious —
telling your employer about the money you owe, harassing you
constantly about your debt, showing up at your home to threaten
you with dire consequences, and so on — or if the attorney’s letter
to the debt collector does not accomplish its goal, the lawyer may
recommend that you file a lawsuit.
You can sue for both actual and punitive damages under the
FDCPA. When you sue for actual damages, you are asking the court
to order the debt collector to reimburse you for the harm that he
Part II: Going on a Debt Diet 
138

did to you. That harm may include lost wages and out-of-pocket
expenses, as well as pain and suffering. If you ask for punitive dam-
ages as well, you are asking the court to make the debt collector
pay you additional money as a way of discouraging him from
breaking the law again.
When you sue a debt collector and win, the FDCPA entitles you to
collect attorney’s fees and court costs from the debt collector
regardless of whether the court awards you actual or punitive
damages.
If your state has its own debt collection law, your attorney may
decide to sue in state court rather than in federal court. Which
court you end up suing in depends on exactly how the debt collec-
tor violated your rights and whether the FDCPA or your state law
offers you better legal remedies for the harm you suffered.

Managing Your Past-Due
Mortgage
In This Chapter
 Understanding the various steps in a foreclosure
 Taking action to avoid a foreclosure
 Knowing what to do when a foreclosure is inevitable
You know the tune: “Be it ever so humble . . .” Whether you
own a tract house in suburbia, an inner city brownstone, or a
mansion on a hill, losing it in a foreclosure easily ranks as one of
life’s worst experiences, financially and emotionally. Financially,
you lose what is probably your most valuable asset, not to mention
all the money you put into it. You may also forfeit any equity you
built up in your home (the difference between what your home is
worth and the balance on your mortgage). Also, aside from filing
for bankruptcy, nothing damages your credit history more than a
foreclosure.
Emotionally, losing your home means losing a fundamental piece of
your life and an important measure of success. A foreclosure may
make you feel like a failure; your self-esteem may take a big hit. You
may also feel embarrassed because the foreclosure will be in the
public records and may even be listed in your local newspaper
(along with other foreclosures in your area). And if you lose your
home, your friends and neighbors will want to know why you’re
moving.
As if that isn’t enough, a foreclosure disrupts your family’s life,
adds stress to your relationships with your spouse and kids, and
forces you to pack and move (which is difficult even under the best
circumstances).

Okay, enough of the bad news. Now for the good news: You can
avoid a foreclosure, assuming you tackle your mortgage problem
soon enough and are clear about your options. In this chapter, we
explain how the foreclosure process works, including what hap-
pens after you fall behind on your mortgage in the weeks and
months leading up to the date that your home is sold on the court-
house steps. We then describe various steps you can take to hold
on to your home. We also highlight the important role that a con-
sumer law attorney can play before, during, and after a foreclosure.
If you fall behind on your home equity loan or on another loan that
you secured with your home, you’re also at risk for a foreclosure.
Your mortgage lender is referred to as the first lien holder, and the
other lenders with liens on your home are referred to as the second
lien holder, third lien holder, and so on. When a lender other than
your mortgage lender forecloses on your home, that other lender
pays off the mortgage lender and any other lenders with earlier
liens, and it becomes the owner of your home. Then the lender
tries to sell your home to recoup as much of its money as possible.
Getting Familiar with the
Foreclosure Timeline
The foreclosure process varies from state to state (according to
each state’s law) and even from lender to lender. However, the fol-
lowing timeline provides you with a general idea of what happens
when you fall behind on your mortgage:
 Your mortgage payment becomes due. Most mortgages have
a 15-day grace period. The grace period is the period of time
after your mortgage due date during which you can pay the
loan without being charged a late fee.
 Your mortgage is 16 days past due. When your loan’s grace
period is up, you are charged a late fee. Your mortgage lender
(or the company that is servicing your mortgage for your
lender — sending your payment coupons, processing your
payments, and so on) may get in touch to find out when it can
expect your payment.
 You are 30 days late on your mortgage. If you still have not
paid your mortgage, and if your lender has not yet received
your next month’s payment either, the lender may turn up the
heat by calling you and/or sending you notices urging you to
get caught up on your mortgage or get in touch.
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
144

As soon as you begin having problems keeping up with your
mortgage, contact a HUD-approved housing counseling
agency. (HUD is the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development.) These agencies offer consumers free advice
and assistance with a wide variety of housing-related issues,
including foreclosures. Among other things, the agency will
work directly with your lender to try to find a way for you to
keep your home. However, while you are working with this
agency, stay aware of your foreclosure date; some mortgage
lenders will move your foreclosure forward while working
with you at the same time. To find a HUD-approved housing
counseling agency in your area, go to www.hud.gov/
offices/hsg/sfh/hcc/hcs.cfm.
 Your mortgage is between 45 days and 60 days past due. If
you’ve not paid the full amount of your mortgage arrearage
(the amount that is past due), and you’ve not contacted your
lender to work out a way to pay it and to continue paying 
on your mortgage at the same time, the lender will turn your
loan over to an attorney who will handle the foreclosure. The
attorney will send you a notice called a “Notice of Default,” a
“Notice of Delinquency,” or something similar. The notice indi-
cates exactly how much you must pay in order to get current
on your mortgage and the number of payments that are past
due. If you’ve not yet contacted your lender to discuss your
mortgage problem, now’s the time.
At about the same time you receive the notice of foreclosure,
your mortgage lender will probably return to you any partial
payments you may have made on your mortgage. Don’t spend
that money! You may need it as you try to negotiate with the
lender to avoid losing your home.
 Your loan is at least 60 days past due. In most states, the
next notice you receive if you’ve still not worked out a way to
deal with your mortgage loan is a “Notice of Acceleration.”
(The exact name of the notice in your state may be a little 
different.) The notice tells you that the entire amount of your
outstanding loan balance is now due in full, not just the past-
due amount. It also indicates when and where your home will
be sold if you do not pay the loan balance. This notice marks
the official start of your foreclosure.
 About 90 to 100 days after your loan has become past due. At
this point, you still have time to avoid the loss of your home,
but your options are fewer and less attractive. Meanwhile, the
foreclosure clock is ticking. Exactly how much time you have
before your home is taken from you depends on whether fore-
closures in your state are nonjudicial (statutory) or judicial.
Chapter 10: Managing Your Past-Due Mortgage 145

Nonjudicial foreclosures tend to happen a lot faster. See the
upcoming sidebar “Judicial versus nonjudicial: What’s the dif-
ference?” for the basic distinctions between the two types.
Until your home is sold to a new buyer, your lender will usu-
ally be happy to call off the foreclosure if you can come up
with the bucks you need to reinstate your loan, which
involves paying your mortgage arrearage in full plus all late
fees and all the lender’s foreclosure-related expenses.
However, if you have a history of missing mortgage payments,
your lender may decide that you’ve been so much trouble it
would prefer to foreclose rather than let you reinstate your
loan. If you do reinstate it, you must resume making your reg-
ular mortgage payments again.
 Assuming the foreclosure process moves forward. If you
have not already consulted with a HUD-approved housing
counseling agency, now’s the time — don’t delay! But if you
believe that your lender is about to take back your home, get
in touch with a bankruptcy attorney. Filing for bankruptcy
stops the foreclosure process and buys you some time to
figure out what to do about your mortgage. The upcoming
section “Handling a Hopeless Situation” discusses the benefits
of filing.
 Sometime after you receive the acceleration notice. Shortly
after, or months after, you get the notice (the timing depends 
on how foreclosures work in your state), your home is sold in a
public auction, possibly on the front steps of your county court-
house. Most home auctions are poorly advertised, so there
probably won’t be a lot of bidders for your home — maybe 
just your mortgage lender. Few bidders means that foreclosed
homes are typically sold for what is owed on them or for less. If
your home is auctioned off for less than your outstanding loan
balance, you have to make up the difference, or deficiency. If you
can’t afford to pay it, your lender can sue for the money.
In a few states, you still have a small window of opportunity
to reinstate your loan even after your home has been auc-
tioned off. Review your loan paperwork or mortgage docu-
ment to find out if you have such a window, or talk to a real
estate attorney.
 After the foreclosure sale. After your home has been sold, a
local sheriff, constable, or marshal shows up with an eviction
notice that indicates the date by which you and all your
belongings must be out of the house. You may also be told
who purchased your home and for how much.
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
146

If your mortgage lender bought your home, it hires a realtor to
sell your home for as much as possible.
If your home sold for less than the outstanding balance on
your mortgage, you receive a notice from your lender asking
you to pay the deficiency. If your lender writes off the differ-
ence between what you owed on your mortgage and what
your home sells for, it sends a 1099 form to the IRS, and that
difference is counted as income for you. As a result, you could
owe more in federal income taxes when April 15 rolls around.
Chapter 10: Managing Your Past-Due Mortgage 147
Judicial versus nonjudicial. 
What’s the difference?
When your lender initiates a foreclosure, the process will involve the court, be
purely administrative, or be some combination of both. A foreclosure that involves
the court is referred to as a judicial foreclosure, and one that does not is called a
nonjudicial or statutory foreclosure. Which process you go through when your
house is foreclosed on depends on the state where your home is located.
In a judicial foreclosure state, your lender must sue you in order to get the court’s
permission to take your home. You receive an official notice, or summons, from the
court, informing you of the lawsuit. You have to attend at least one court hearing. If
you’re not already working with a consumer law attorney, hire one as soon as you
receive this notice!
Judicial foreclosures are relatively time consuming. From start to finish, they may
take as long as a year. You can delay or stop a foreclosure at any time up until the
sale of your home.
If foreclosures in your state are nonjudicial (statutory), there is no lawsuit and no
court hearing, so the process is much faster than a judicial foreclosure. In fact, after
the process begins, your home may be sold in just a few months. The mortgage
lender probably has to file paperwork with the court, advertise your debt in your
local newspaper, send you the appropriate notice(s), and give you one more oppor-
tunity to either pay the full amount that you owe or work out a way to avoid a fore-
closure. Failing both, your home is sold, and you must move out.
Even though there is no court involvement in a nonjudicial foreclosure, hire an attor-
ney to help you anyway. The attorney may be able to stop or slow down the fore-
closure process.
For a summary of the foreclosure process in your particular state, go to www.
foreclosures.com/pages/state_laws.asp or talk to a consumer law
attorney.

However, depending on your financial situation, the IRS may
decide that you are insolvent, which means that you would
not have to pay any federal taxes that year. Talk to a CPA
about whether you are insolvent by IRS standards. If you are,
the CPA can file the appropriate paperwork with the IRS to
prove your insolvency.
Keeping a Foreclosure at Bay
As soon as you know that you’re going to have problems keeping
up your mortgage, or as soon as you’ve missed a payment, get in
touch with your mortgage lender to discuss your options. Contact
its workouts or loss mitigation department. Also, get in touch with a
HUD-approved housing counseling agency, especially if you are
intimidated by the idea of talking with your mortgage lender or
don’t feel confident about dealing with financial matters.
If you obtained your mortgage through a national lender, you 
probably have to contact the mortgage servicing company that
your lender hired to manage your loan, rather than your actual
lender. National lenders don’t administer the mortgages they make.
Throughout the rest of this chapter, when we refer to your lender
or mortgage lender, know that we’re referring to either the mort-
gage servicing company or your actual mortgage lender.
If you’ve already missed a payment or two, read each and every
notice you receive about your mortgage. The notices inform you of
your rights, alert you to important deadlines associated with your
past-due mortgage, and provide you with opportunities to try to
resolve your mortgage arrearage. Also, if you receive a voice mail
message about your mortgage, return the call right away.
Don’t assume that if you do not pick up a certified letter related 
to your past-due mortgage, the foreclosure process won’t move
forward. It will.
Taking immediate steps
If your finances are not in extremely bad shape, you may be able to
resolve your mortgage problem on your own, assuming you act
right away. Here are some options for continuing to pay on your
mortgage and for getting caught up on any mortgage arrearage:
 Develop a realistic household budget, and stick to it. In
Chapter 4, we explain how to prepare a budget.
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
148

 Review your existing budget for expenses you can reduce or
eliminate. In Chapter 5, we offer lots of budget-cutting ideas.
When you can’t afford to pay all your debts, always pay your
high priority debts first, including your mortgage (see
Chapter 4).
 Negotiate reduced payments with your other creditors and
put the money you save toward your mortgage. If you need
help negotiating, schedule an appointment with a federally
approved credit counseling agency. In Chapter 6, we show you
how to negotiate.
 Lower your monthly debt payments by consolidating your
debts. In Chapter 7, we tell you how debt consolidation works
and provide consolidation advice.
 Borrow money. This may be a good option if you are sure
that your financial problems are temporary. For example,
maybe you fell behind on your mortgage because you lost
your job, but you’re going to begin a new job next month.
Possible sources of short-term cash include
• A loan from a friend or relative
• A cash advance from a credit card
• Money borrowed from your retirement account
• Money borrowed from a cash value (whole life) insur-
ance policy you may own
In Chapter 7, we detail the risks of borrowing from your retire-
ment account or your life insurance policy.
Do not borrow money from any of these sources unless you
are 100 percent sure that your financial problems are behind
you and you’ll be able to repay the loan. You only add to your
problems otherwise.
If you’re having problems paying a mortgage that is federally
insured, you may be able to get help from a plan or program that
other homeowners are not eligible for. To find out, get in touch with
the agency that insured your loan, such as the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the U.S. Farmers Home
Administration (FmHA), or the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA). If you obtained your loan through a state or local housing pro-
gram, contact the agency that administers the loan. The agency
may also have special plans or programs for homeowners who are
having mortgage problems. You may also want to talk with a HUD-
approved housing counseling agency.
Chapter 10: Managing Your Past-Due Mortgage 149

Negotiating with your lender
If you can’t figure out a way to deal with your mortgage on your
own, get in touch with your mortgage lender right away to find out
if it will help you. For example,
 The lender may agree to let you pay any arrearage you owe 
in a lump sum in a couple of months. This may be a good
arrangement if you fell behind on your mortgage because 
of a temporary financial setback.
 If a lump sum payment is not realistic, the lender may let you
add a portion of the arrearage to each of your regular mort-
gage payments over a set period of time, or it may agree to
add the arrearage to the end of your mortgage so you can 
pay it off in installments then.
If your lender proposes an arrangement that you don’t think you
can afford, let the lender know, and propose an alternative.
While you are paying off your mortgage arrearage, you must make
all your regular mortgage payments. Negotiating a way to deal with
your past-due mortgage does not affect your obligation to continue
paying your loan.
Before you approach your lender about your arrearage, pull together
relevant financial information: a copy of your loan agreement; your
current household budget; proof of your current household income;
your most recent federal tax return; and a list of your assets, includ-
ing their market values. The lender may also want proof of some of
your expenses, like your utility bills, car payments, and home mainte-
nance costs. Be sure to review the negotiating tips we supply in
Chapter 6.
You may read in other books or on Web sites that your mortgage
lender may agree to a permanent or temporary change in the
terms of your mortgage loan, such as changing the interest rate or
lowering your monthly payments. Don’t get your hopes up! Such a
change is highly unlikely, especially if you got your loan through a
national mortgage lender. Most national lenders sell their mortgage
loans to investor pools, so the loans are not theirs to change. Your
best shot at a temporary or permanent change in the terms of your
mortgage is if you obtained your loan through a local lender.
If you are considering renting out your home and living somewhere
cheaper so you can better afford to pay your mortgage arrearage and
keep up with future mortgage payments, don’t move out until you
and the lender have reached an agreement. Lenders will negotiate
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
150

with homeowners in your situation only if the homeowners are still
living in their homes. The section “Considering more drastic options”
later in this chapter discusses renting out your home.
If you and your lender work out a way for you to pay your arrearage,
make sure the plan is communicated to the department handling
your foreclosure. Otherwise, the foreclosure will continue moving
forward. Also, ask the lender to put the terms of your agreement in
writing. If the lender refuses, prepare your own agreement. The
agreement should include your loan number and all the agreement
terms. Make copies, and send one copy to the person with whom
you negotiated the agreement and another to the lender’s foreclo-
sure department. Keep the original for your files.
Refinancing your loan
You may want to consider refinancing your existing loan, especially
if you have a lot of equity in your home, to pay off your current
loan and any arrearage. Your goal is to get a new mortgage with
more affordable monthly payments. Your current lender probably
won’t agree to refinance your loan given the problems you’ve had
with your current loan, but you may find another lender ready to
bargain with you. After all, loan officers make money according to
the number of new loans they write!
Generally, refinancing isn’t a good idea if you don’t have a lot of
equity in your home. In fact, you may not be able to find a lender
who will give you a new loan if you don’t have much equity.
If you do refinance and you’re retired or close to retirement, try to
avoid getting a new 15- or 30-year loan. Having to make mortgage
payments for so many years may strain your budget; it could even
force you to delay retirement or begin working again if you’ve
already retired. If you don’t owe a large amount on your home, a
better option is to refinance with a short-term (maybe five-year)
loan, if you can afford the payments.
When you think about refinancing, be very careful about the terms
you agree to. Read all the fine print in the loan agreement. Watch
out for interest rates that start out low and then increase. Also,
beware of interest-only mortgages; payments that are affordable
during the interest-only period can skyrocket when you begin
paying interest and principal. At that point, you have to make up
for those first years when you paid nothing on the principal.
Chapter 10: Managing Your Past-Due Mortgage 151

If your finances are in such bad shape that you can’t find a tradi-
tional lender to refinance your mortgage, you may want to con-
sider working with a hard money investor. This is a legitimate
investor who makes loans that traditional lenders consider too
risky. A hard money loan comes with high fees and a high interest
rate, so it is usually not a permanent solution to your problem. But
it could be a good way to buy yourself time to sell your home or to
pursue another option for avoiding a foreclosure. To find a hard
money lender, talk to a real estate agent, look under “Real Estate
Investor” in your local Yellow Pages, or search for “hard money
investors” on the Internet.
Considering more drastic options
If you and your lender can’t work out a way to pay your mortgage
arrearage, you can’t find affordable refinancing, and you continue
to have problems paying your mortgage, it’s time to take more
drastic action. You may need to consider
 Renting out your home and renting a less expensive home
or apartment for yourself. If you pursue this option, be sure
that the rental income from your home covers not just your
monthly mortgage payments, but also the cost of your home-
owner’s insurance and property taxes if those expenses are
not included in your monthly payments, as well as the cost of
maintaining your home.
 Finding someone to assume your mortgage. If your loan is
assumable (your loan paperwork indicates whether it is or
isn’t), you can try to find someone to take it over so you won’t
be responsible for paying on the loan anymore. If your loan is
not assumable, but it’s an option you’d like to consider, your
lender may agree to an assumption. After all, getting money
from someone else is preferable to not getting any money
from you!
 Selling your home. Yes, it’s tough, but it may be necessary.
We discuss this possibility in the upcoming section “Handling
a Hopeless Situation.”
How a Lawyer Can Help
When you have problems keeping up with your mortgage and are
worried that you may face a foreclosure, the advice and assistance
of a consumer law attorney can be invaluable. The attorney can
explain exactly how the foreclosure process works in your state,
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
152

advise you of your legal rights, and talk with you about your alter-
natives for avoiding a foreclosure.
If you want to negotiate with your lender regarding your mortgage
arrearage, but you don’t feel comfortable doing so yourself, you may
want to hire your attorney to do it for you. In fact, turning the negoti-
ations over to an attorney is wise even if you feel comfortable with
negotiating; the attorney knows what you can ask from a lender, is
prepared to respond to your lender when it makes an offer, and will
understand the lender’s (sometimes confusing) lingo.
Here are some other things an attorney may be able to do:
 Identify problems in your loan paperwork or in your loan 
closing that can help you stop a foreclosure or slow down 
the foreclosure process
 Leverage more negotiating bargaining power with your lender
 Reduce the total amount that you owe on your mortgage
For example, the attorney may determine that your lender does
not have an enforceable lien on your home; has been charging 
you too much interest; did not accurately disclose all the terms of
your mortgage loan according to the requirements of the Truth in
Lending Act (TILA); violated the terms of the federal Real Estate
Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA); and so on.
If you don’t meet with an attorney until after your foreclosure 
has begun, the attorney may be able to help you gain some control
over the process if it turns out that all the required procedures
leading up to the foreclosure were not followed or your rights were
violated after the foreclosure began. For example, you may not
have been given an opportunity to cure your default (get caught up
on your past-due mortgage), assuming you have that right under
your contract or according to your state’s law. Or you may not
have received certain notices by the required deadlines.
The attorney can also tell if you should consider filing for bank-
ruptcy in order to stop the foreclosure and can refer you to a good
bankruptcy attorney. (Some consumer law attorneys are also bank-
ruptcy attorneys.) We discuss bankruptcy in the next section.
For affordable legal help, contact the Legal Aid office in your area
or get in touch with your state or local bar association to find out if
they have a list of housing attorneys who will help you for little or
no money. An alternative to an attorney may be a nonprofit foreclo-
sure prevention organization, if there is one in your area.
Chapter 10: Managing Your Past-Due Mortgage 153

Handling a Hopeless Situation
Say your mortgage is 90 to 100 days past due and you’ve not come
up with a way to avoid the loss of your home (unless your rich
uncle Harry dies — quick — and leaves you a bundle of cash).
Tough action is now required. Your goal should be to minimize 
further damage to your finances. Here’s what you may need to do:
 Hire a lawyer. If you receive a notice that the foreclosure 
has officially begun and you’re not already working with a con-
sumer law attorney, schedule an appointment with one pronto!
After a foreclosure begins, the attorney may be able to slow or
stop the process, but that becomes more unlikely with each
passing day.
 Sell your home. You may be wise to cut your losses and sell.
Selling your home is a good idea if you have a lot of equity in
it and the real estate market in your area is strong. If you sell
it, you’ll probably get more for it than if your home is sold on
the auction block. Therefore, you’re more likely to get the
money you need to pay off your lender, and you may even be
able to put some money in your own pocket. Selling your
home also damages your credit history less than losing it in a
foreclosure.
Don’t dillydally around trying to sell your home yourself
unless you already know someone who wants to buy it. Work
with a real estate agent. You don’t have time to waste because
the foreclosure clock is ticking away.
 Short-sell your home. If the real estate agent you hire doesn’t
think you can sell your home for enough to pay your lender
everything you owe before the foreclosure date, ask the
lender to agree to a short sale, which means you can sell your
home for less than what you owe on it. The lender may agree
in order to minimize its foreclosure costs.
If your lender agrees to a short sale, before you finalize the
sale, try to get a written agreement from the lender stating
that you don’t have to pay the loan deficiency. Keep in mind
that the lender will report the deficiency amount to the IRS as
1099 income, which could cause you to owe more in income
taxes that year. However, if the IRS decides that you are insol-
vent based on the condition of your finances, you won’t owe
any federal taxes for the year the deficiency is reported.
Consult with a CPA to determine whether you are insolvent.
The CPA can also file the appropriate paperwork with the IRS
to prove that you are.
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
154

Your agent may already know someone who would like to 
purchase your home. If not, the agent may get in touch with 
a hard money investor who regularly purchases distressed
properties like yours. It’s not unusual for real estate agents to
have relationships with these kinds of investors because the
agents receive a finder’s fee every time they bring a distressed
property to an investor.
 Deed your home back to the lender in lieu of a foreclosure.
This step simply involves giving your home back to your
lender. However, it’s not an option if you have a lot of equity
built up in your home because you will lose the equity.
Although a deed in lieu of foreclosure keeps a foreclosure off
your credit history, the fact that you gave your home back will
show up. That information does almost as much damage to
your credit history as a foreclosure does.
If you give your home back, the lender will expect you to have
your home appraised — usually at your expense — in order to
find out how much it’s likely to sell for. If the appraisal shows
that your home won’t sell for enough money to pay off the 
outstanding balance on your home and cover all your lender’s
foreclosure costs as well, the lender will look to you to pay the
deficiency, or it may refuse to okay a deed in lieu of a foreclo-
sure. Or the lender may agree to a deed in lieu of a foreclosure
and let you pay less than the full amount of the deficiency if
the lender believes that by doing so it will end up with more
money than if it proceeds with a foreclosure. Bottom line: The
lender will do whatever is in its best interest financially.
 File for bankruptcy. If things look bleak, you can file for bank-
ruptcy in order to stop a foreclosure. If you file a Chapter 13
reorganization bankruptcy, you can take three to five years to
pay off your mortgage arrearage, all late fees you owe, and the
foreclosure-related costs your lender has incurred. Plus, you
have to continue making your regular mortgage payments at
the same time. If you file a Chapter 7 liquidation bankruptcy,
you lose your home, but you don’t have to pay your mortgage
arrearage, any late fees, or the lender’s foreclosure costs.
During the six to eight months that you are in Chapter 7 bank-
ruptcy, it’s possible (depending on the state of your finances
after you’ve eliminated most of your other debts through the
bankruptcy) that you could catch up on your past-due mort-
gage payments. In that case, you would be current on your
mortgage when you emerged from bankruptcy and could keep
your home.
Chapter 10: Managing Your Past-Due Mortgage 155

If your lender has done anything to violate your rights, your
bankruptcy attorney can sue the lender for these violations as
part of the bankruptcy process. As a result of the lawsuits, you
may end up owing less. For example, maybe your lender did
not comply with the federal Truth in Lending Act (TILA) when
it gave you your mortgage, charged you too much interest, vio-
lated the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) when
you closed on your home, or did not provide you with the
required notifications during the months leading up to the
foreclosure.
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
156
Steering clear of foreclosure scams
Desperate straits sometimes call for desperate measures. However, be careful what
you do to avoid the loss of your home. There are plenty of sleazy scam artists who
will pretend they can help you when, in fact, they have their sights set on getting
your home. If you are contacted by a company or individual claiming to be able to
help you avoid losing your home in a foreclosure, or if you find out about such an
offer, don’t agree to anything or sign any paperwork until you have had a consumer
law attorney or a counselor with a HUD-approved housing counseling agency
review all the paperwork related to the offer.
Here are some common foreclosure scams:
 A company offers to give you a loan so you can get current on your mortgage
and to pay your mortgage for a limited period of time. In return, you must make
monthly payments to the company. Unless you read all the details in the paper-
work, you assume that by making those payments you are repaying the loan the
company made to you. In fact, when you sign the agreement, you actually trans-
fer ownership of your home to the company. In other words, the payments you
are making are rent payments because you are now a tenant in your own home.
To buy back your home, you must pay the home’s current market value or a price
indicated in the agreement, and often very expensive fees as well. Furthermore,
the agreement probably gives the company the right to evict you from the home,
maybe if you are just one day late with a payment.
 You are told that in return for giving a company the title to your home, you can
continue living there while you buy back your home. However, the terms of the
buyback are so impossible that eventually you fall behind on your payments and
are forced to move out.
 A company offers to help you work things out with your mortgage lender so you
can keep your home. In exchange, it charges you an exorbitant amount of
money. However, the company does little or nothing to really help you, and even-
tually you lose your home.

 Understanding what happens when your vehicle is auctioned off
 Getting your vehicle back after it’s been repossessed
 Avoiding a repossession in the first place
 Seeking legal help
H
aving your car repossessed can be disastrous. Most of us
need a car to get to work, and using public transportation is
not always a realistic alternative. Living without a car makes every-
thing more difficult, and to boot, a repossession adds to the nega-
tive information in your credit history. (Like most other negative
information, the fact that your car was repossessed lingers in your
credit history for seven and a half years.)
In this chapter, we explain how repossession works and when the
process is likely to begin. We explain what an auto recovery spe-
cialist (a.k.a. the repo man) can and can’t do to take your car, and
we tell you how you can get it back after it’s been repossessed. 
We also review your options for avoiding repossession in the first
place. Last but not least, we tell you how a consumer law attorney
can help you before, during, and after the loss of your car.
Running through a Repossession
If you fall behind on your car payments, you are playing with fire.
The company that financed the purchase of your vehicle is legally
entitled to take it back without getting the court’s permission first.
To make matters worse, most states don’t require auto lenders to
give consumers any advance notice of their repossession plans. In

other words, if you live in one of these states, you could walk out
your front door one morning and find that your car is not in your
driveway, or you could leave your office one afternoon and dis-
cover that your vehicle is gone. The repo man took it!
Knowing the law
For specific information regarding when your car can be taken,
exactly how the repossession process works, and your reposses-
sion rights, do these two things:
 Find out about the law in your state by speaking to your state
attorney general’s office or with a consumer law attorney.
 Review the details of your car loan agreement.
Your loan agreement may give you the right to avoid repossession
by curing the default, or getting caught up on your car loan within a
certain period of time. If you have already missed a loan payment,
meet with a consumer law attorney immediately.
When you are worried about having your vehicle repossessed, a
natural response is to try to hide it by storing it at the home of a
friend or relative or by moving the vehicle out of state. Don’t do so
until you have checked with a consumer law attorney or with your
state attorney general’s office. It may be illegal in your state to try
to hide your vehicle from the repo man.
Expecting the repo man
The repo man may arrive to take your car when you are at home,
at work, at church — pretty much anytime. If he shows up at your
home, he can come onto your property to get the vehicle; he can
even go into your garage, but he cannot break into the garage if
your car is inside and the garage door is locked.
Exercising your rights
If you are aware that a repo man has come to take your car, you
don’t have to just hand over the keys. No law requires that you
make it easy for him. You can even stop the repo man dead in his
tracks by telling him, “Do not take my car,” “Leave my car where it
is,” or something similar. Don’t assume, however, that he won’t try
again. He will, and eventually he’ll get your vehicle.
In most states, the repo man cannot threaten, bully, or intimidate
you physically or verbally in order to scare you into giving up your
vehicle, and he cannot use force against you. If he does, he is
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
158

breaching the peace, and that’s illegal. At the same time, don’t
become physical with the repo man, or you may be charged with
assault.
If someone claiming to be a government official arrives with the
repo man, ask to see proof of that person’s official status. Normally,
the only reason a policeman or other law enforcement official is
involved in a repossession is to deliver a court order requiring you
to give up your vehicle. (If you don’t obey a court order, you’re
breaking the law.)
When there is no court order, the law enforcement official is proba-
bly there just to intimidate you, which may be a violation of the
federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act or your state’s debt col-
lection law. If the person in uniform is just pretending to be a law
enforcement official, he is impersonating a law officer, which is a
federal or a state offense. Either way, get in touch with a consumer
law attorney immediately.
Ask for copies of any legal documents that you are told relate to
the repossession. Assuming you receive them, share the docu-
ments with a consumer law attorney. They may contain errors or
other problems that the attorney can use to try to get your car
back. For example, the lender may have violated the federal Truth
in Lending Act (TILA) by not revealing all the terms of your loan, or
your loan agreement may charge you a higher rate of interest than
your state allows.
Preparing for a lawsuit
Call the police immediately if the repo man violates your rights
when he is trying to take your car — for example, he breaches the
peace or breaks into your locked garage. After the police help you
deal with the emergency, contact a consumer law attorney. You
may have a good basis for a lawsuit against the repo man.
If other people see the repo man breaking the law, get their names
and contact information. If you decide to file a lawsuit, your attor-
ney may want to talk with the witnesses and may decide to call
them to testify if the lawsuit goes to trial.
Maintain a record of every expense you incur related to the 
repossession of your car, including legal fees and court costs, lost
wages, travel expenses, copying, and the cost of any medical care
you seek because of sleep or emotional problems resulting from
the repossession. If you sue your auto lender and win the lawsuit,
the judge will probably order the defendant to reimburse you for
expenses you can prove.
Chapter 11: Keeping Your Wheels on the Road 159

Having Your Car Auctioned Off
After your vehicle is repossessed, the lender stores it and arranges
to sell it in a public auction. In most states, the lender is required
to notify you in writing about the date, time, and location of the
auction so you can buy your vehicle back or reinstate your auto
loan before the vehicle is sold. The upcoming section “Getting Your
Vehicle Back” explains the ins and outs of both options.
When your vehicle is sold, the lender applies the sale proceeds to
your outstanding car loan balance; to the late fees you owe; and to
the lender’s costs of repossessing, storing, and selling it. If the pro-
ceeds don’t cover everything, the lender is legally entitled to ask
you to make up the difference, or deficiency.
Although your auto lender is legally obligated to sell your vehicle
for a “commercially responsible price,” don’t count on the vehicle
selling for enough money to avoid a deficiency. That rarely hap-
pens in a public auction.
Arranging to pay the deficiency
If you cannot afford to pay the full amount of the deficiency in a
lump sum, ask the lender if you can pay it over time in installments.
The lender may okay an installment plan to avoid the expense of
trying to collect the money from you. You and the lender need to
reach an agreement about the amount of each installment, the
amount of any down payment or final balloon payment you may
have to make, the interest rate that will apply to the installment
payments, and so on.
If you and the lender come to an agreement about paying the 
deficiency, get it in writing. Do not begin making payments until
you have everything in writing. If the lender won’t prepare an
agreement, write one yourself and send the lender a copy after 
you have signed and dated the original.
Anticipating what happens if 
you can’t pay the deficiency
What if the lender refuses to let you pay the deficiency through an
installment plan and insists that you pay what you owe in a lump
sum? Don’t give in to his demands if by doing so you jeopardize
your ability to keep up with your priority debts and/or your most
important living expenses.
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
160

By not giving in, you leave the lender with three options. The
lender can
 Turn your deficiency over to a debt collector. In Chapter 9,
we explain how debt collectors work and your rights when
they contact you.
 Sue you for the right to collect the deficiency. If the lender
wins the lawsuit, it may ask the court for permission to do
one of several things:
• Put a lien on one of your assets so you can’t borrow
against it or sell it until you pay the deficiency.
Chapter 11: Keeping Your Wheels on the Road 161
Saving the personal items in your car
If you are concerned that your vehicle is about to be repossessed, don’t leave any
personal belongings in it. Remove the CD player, radio, TV, or VCR if you installed it
after purchasing the vehicle. Take out your dry cleaning, CDs, tools, sporting equip-
ment, child seats, and so on. You’re entitled to get these items back if they are in
your car when it is taken, but let’s be realistic: Personal items can easily “disap-
pear” in a repossession.
Also avoid leaving your loan paperwork in the glove compartment of your vehicle.
If you hire a consumer law attorney after the repossession, having that paperwork
makes her job easier.
If any personal property is in your vehicle when it is taken, write a polite letter to
the lender right away saying that you want the items returned immediately or you
want to be reimbursed for them. (If you want to get your loan paperwork returned,
you should write a similar letter asking for it.) Include in your letter an itemized list
of everything you want back. If you have photos of the items, make copies and send
them with the letter. Do the same if you have receipts from when you purchased the
items. Keep in mind that your loan agreement may give you only a limited period of
time to make your request.
Make a copy of the letter for your files. Then send the original letter with copies of
all backup information to the lender via certified mail with a return receipt requested.
That way you have a record of when the lender received your correspondence.
Consult with a consumer law attorney if the lender refuses to return everything that
you have asked for, claims that the items you want back were not in your vehicle
when it was taken, refuses to reimburse you for the items, or wants to reimburse you
for less than what you believe the items are worth. If any of your personal property
is worth a substantial amount of money, the attorney may advise you to sue the
lender and/or the company that employs the repo man.

• Seize one of your assets, sell it, and apply the proceeds
to your debt.
• Garnish your wages, assuming wage garnishment is legal
in your state. When your wages are garnished, the lender
receives a portion of them for a limited period of time.
Contact a consumer law attorney as soon as you know that your
lender is going to sue you to collect the deficiency you owe.
 Write off the deficiency and report it as uncollectible to 
the credit bureaus it works with. The lender is most apt 
to do this if the amount of the deficiency is relatively small.
However, when a creditor writes off a debt, it is legally entitled
to resume its collection efforts at any time.
Getting Your Vehicle Back
After your vehicle is taken and before it is auctioned off, you 
have two options to try to get your vehicle back. One option is 
to buy it back from the lender. Buying it back may make financial
sense if your vehicle is worth more than the outstanding balance
on your loan.
Your other option may be to reinstate your car loan. Reinstating the
loan means that you agree to resume paying on it according to
your original agreement with the lender.
Don’t consider either option until you have reviewed your budget
(see Chapter 4). As angry as you may be about the loss of your vehi-
cle, trying to get it back is a really bad idea if your finances are in no
better shape now than they were when your car was repossessed.
Also, before you do anything, talk with a consumer law attorney.
The attorney may find problems with your loan paperwork or with
the way that your car was repossessed. You may be able to use
those problems to your advantage if the lender is worried about
the possibility of a lawsuit.
Buying back your car
To buy back your vehicle before it is sold, you must make a lump
sum payment to your lender that covers the full amount of the out-
standing balance on your car loan, all the late fees you owe, and
the costs that your lender incurred seizing and storing your vehi-
cle. When you do, the lender gives you title to your vehicle, which
means that you own it free and clear.
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
162

Before you make the payment or sign any buyback paperwork, get a
written, itemized accounting from the lender of exactly how much
you owe. Because you are paying the loan off early, the accounting
should show that the lender is crediting you for unearned interest on
the loan and auto insurance payments. If you have any questions or
concerns about the accounting, talk with a consumer law attorney.
Instead of buying your car back before the auction, you may want
to wait until the auction itself. The advantage of waiting is that if
you are the high bidder, you’ll probably end up paying less to get
your car back at auction. The disadvantage, of course, is that you
may not be the high bidder.
Reinstating your car loan
Reinstating your car loan can be another way to get your car back
after it has been repossessed. You need to make certain that your car
loan allows it, and your lender must say that a reinstatement is okay.
To reinstate your loan, you must not only pay the amount of the
loan that is past due plus late fees; you must also reimburse the
lender for all its repossession and storage costs. Then you must
resume making your regular car loan payments (on time).
You may think that if you reinstate your car loan, you can turn
around and sell your vehicle for enough money to pay the loan off
and maybe even make a small profit. Don’t bank on it. That’s a pos-
sibility only if you have very few payments left on the loan and
your vehicle is worth a lot more than what you owe on it. Because
Chapter 11: Keeping Your Wheels on the Road 163
Considering a personal loan
If you are tempted to borrow money from a friend or family member to buy your car
back, make absolutely sure that you can afford to repay it. Otherwise, you may have
your car, but you may lose an important relationship. If you are sure that you can
repay the loan, treat it as seriously as if you were getting the loan from a bank. Put
all the terms in writing, and let your friend or relative put a lien on your vehicle. That
way, if you default on the loan, the friend or relative has the option of taking the vehi-
cle as payment.
Even if you give your friend or family member a lien on your car, that person may
feel uncomfortable taking the vehicle if you default on the loan. Conversely, you may
get upset if that person does take it. More often than not, borrowing money from
someone you know is a bad idea.

most vehicles start losing value as soon as they hit the road, your
car is probably worth less, not more, than your loan balance.
If your car loan agreement gives you the right to reinstate your
loan, and you believe that you can live up to all the terms, ask your
lender for a reinstatement. Be aware that the lender likely won’t
agree to your request, preferring instead to get some money for
your vehicle right away by selling it at a public auction. But there
is always the possibility that your lender may go along with a 
reinstatement, especially if your vehicle is not worth much. So go
ahead and ask; you’ve got nothing to lose.
Avoiding a Repossession 
in the First Place
Repossession may not be inevitable, assuming you act quickly
enough. You can take steps to avoid it, including negotiating with
your lender, selling your vehicle, and filing for bankruptcy.
If you are not sure whether any of these options are right for you,
meet with a consumer law attorney. The attorney can help you
evaluate them in light of the state of your finances, the laws of 
your state, and the terms of your loan agreement.
Negotiating a way to keep your car
Say that your credit history is in relatively good shape and you
haven’t yet missed a car loan payment, but you are worried about
keeping up with those payments. You may want to approach your
lender about extending the term of your loan (its duration) in order
to lower your monthly payments. If the lender agrees, you will pay
more in interest over the life of the loan, but that trade-off may
help you keep your vehicle.
Having realistic expectations
Review your budget (see Chapter 4) before you begin negotiating
with your car lender so you know exactly how much you can afford
to pay on your car loan each month. If you agree to more than you
can afford and you default on your new loan agreement, the lender
will probably initiate repossession.
If you just need some temporary relief from your car payments,
maybe because you lost your job and your new one does not start
for a month or two, your lender may agree to work with you. For
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
164

example, the lender may let you make interest-only payments or
reduced loan payments for a while. (Usually an auto lender will not
extend a temporary relief arrangement past three months.)
Before you ask for such temporary relief, read your loan agree-
ment. It may give your lender the right to call your loan, or demand
that you pay it in full immediately, even after you get caught up on
what is past due. If that’s what your loan agreement says, you can
ask the lender to waive its right to call the loan, but the lender
probably will say no. Even if your lender agrees, don’t expect to get
the change in writing.
Make sure that you understand exactly how you must make up the
difference between what you would have been paying on your loan
if you had continued making your regular payments and what you
will be paying if your lender agrees to give you temporary relief.
Your lender may want you to pay the difference in a lump sum after
you begin making your regular loan payments again or at the end
of your loan agreement. Or the lender may agree to let you pay the
difference in installments at the end of your loan.
If your lender does not seem interested in negotiating, you may be
able to sweeten the pot by putting up more collateral. In other
words, the lender puts a lien on another asset you own (in addition
to the lien it has on your vehicle). If you don’t live up to the new
loan payment arrangement, the lender can take both assets. This
option may interest a bank or credit union. If your loan is with a
national car lender, like GMAC or Ford Motor Credit (companies
that finance cars on a national basis and do not make any other
kinds of loans), this option won’t work. National car lenders are
not interested in getting additional loan collateral.
If you’re not confident about your negotiating ability or you tend to
get flustered by numbers and legalese, ask an attorney, CPA, or
friend to do the negotiating for you. Some lenders can be very diffi-
cult to deal with and have no qualms about taking advantage of
your weaknesses.
Protecting yourself
If your lender agrees to any temporary or permanent changes in
the terms of your car loan, ask for everything to be put in writing.
Don’t sign the agreement until you have read it thoroughly and
have received clear answers to any questions you have.
If possible, have a consumer law attorney review the agreement
before you sign it. The attorney can make certain that you are ade-
quately protected, that the lender is not charging you more than
the allowable maximum rate of interest, and that the lender has
Chapter 11: Keeping Your Wheels on the Road 165

disclosed all the terms of credit as required by the federal Truth in
Lending Act.
When you read the agreement, pay careful attention to these 
provisions:
 The amount of your payments
 The payment due date
 The interest rate
 How you must catch up on any past-due loan payments
 How you must make up the difference between what you
would have paid on your car loan and what you will be paying
(if the lender agrees to change the terms of your loan for a
limited period of time)
 When you (or the lender) will be considered in default of the
agreement
 The consequences of defaulting
Selling your car
If you fear that you won’t be able to keep up your car payments,
you can try to sell your car before you miss any loan payments and
use the proceeds to pay off your car loan. Your goal is to sell it for
more than your outstanding loan balance so you have some cash
to buy a used vehicle. However, that rarely happens.
Here’s a more realistic situation: You probably owe more on your
vehicle than it’s worth. Unless you can come up with the difference
between what your car sells for and what you still owe on it, the
lender won’t give you clear title to the vehicle, which means you
can’t complete the sale.
Another option is to find someone to take over your loan pay-
ments, assuming that your loan agreement allows it and the lender
okays it. In this situation, the other person takes your car and
starts making the loan payments.
The lender probably won’t remove you from the loan paperwork, so
even though you no longer have the car, you are still liable for the
loan. If the person who assumes your car note loses the vehicle in
repossession and does not pay the lender the deficiency that remains
after the car is auctioned off, the lender can come after you for the
money. Plus, your credit history suffers even though you weren’t the
one who defaulted. For these reasons, this option works best if you
know (and trust) the person who takes over your loan payments.

Chapter 11: Keeping Your Wheels on the Road 167
Selling your vehicle fast 
(and for a good price)
You end up with more money in your pocket if you sell your car to an individual buyer
rather than to a used car dealer. Follow this advice to get your car sold quickly and
for top dollar:
 Price your car fairly. A good resource for determining your car’s current
national market value is the Kelley Blue Book. You can access it at
www.kbb.com, or you can find a copy at your local library. Other sites you may
want to visit to come up with a realistic asking price include www.edmunds.
com, www.nadaguides.com, and www.autosite.com.
After you have determined your vehicle’s national market value, review ads for
cars similar to yours in your local newspaper and/or in local car buying and sell-
ing magazines. In your area, your vehicle may command a higher or lower
asking price than the market value indicated by the national resources.
Ask for slightly more than you are willing to take because most buyers expect
you to negotiate. If you get no nibbles after you have advertised your car, reduce
the price.
Consider the overall condition of your car when you decide on an asking price.
Discount the price for dents and dings, old tires, worn upholstery, a radio that
gets iffy reception, a CD player that does not work, and so on.
 Take care of inexpensive repairs before you put your car on the market. Be
prepared to share your repair and maintenance records with potential buyers
so they know that you have taken good care of the car.
 Clean your car inside and out before you show it to prospective buyers. First
impressions count!
 Let your friends and relatives know that you are selling your car. Advertising it
via word of mouth could save you the cost of an ad.
 Advertise in your local newspaper and/or on the Web. Web sites to consider
include www.craigslist.com or car buying and selling sites like www.
autobytel.com, www.autotrader.com, and www.cars.com. If you
advertise on the Web, include a photo or two.
When you write your ad, highlight your car’s pluses but don’t misrepresent its
condition. The pluses may include that your car has had just one owner, it’s
always been kept in a garage, it has low mileage, it’s never been in an accident,
it’s in perfect condition inside and out, and so on.
To be safe when potential buyers want to look at your car, meet them during the day in
a public location like a mall parking lot, rather than at your home. Also, have someone
else with you when you meet with a prospective buyer to sign the sale paperwork.

Giving your car back voluntarily
When you and the lender can’t work out a way for you to keep
your car, and when selling it is not a viable option, you can just
give it back to the lender. Doing so is called a voluntary reposses-
sion. The main benefit is that you don’t have to reimburse the
lender for the costs of repossessing your car. However, you may
still have to pay the lender for the costs of storing and selling it.
After you give your car back, the process works pretty much as if
you lost your car in repossession. Your car is auctioned off; the
lender applies the sale proceeds to your loan’s outstanding bal-
ance, all unpaid late fees, and the costs of storing and selling the
vehicle; and you must pay any deficiency.
Don’t voluntarily give up your car or sign any paperwork related to
it without trying to get your lender to give you some concessions.
After all, you’ll be saving the lender the cost of repossessing the
vehicle. For example, you may want to ask the lender to let you 
off the hook for any deficiency you may owe and to agree not to
report the voluntary repossession to the credit bureau(s) it works
with. Your lender probably won’t agree to most concessions, but it
may forgive a very small deficiency if it decides that collecting it
would probably take too much time and money, or if it knows that
you are judgment proof because you own no assets and your state
does not permit wage garnishment.
If your lender agrees to some concessions, put them in writing
(because the lender probably won’t do so). Sign and date the docu-
ment, and send a copy to your lender via certified mail; request a
return receipt for your records. That piece of paper will come in
handy if the lender goes back on your agreement.
Most auto lenders are pretty hard nosed and not disposed to
making concessions to consumers who have fallen behind on their
loan payments. However, it never hurts to ask. Who knows, your
lender may just have a heart!
Filing for bankruptcy
Filing for bankruptcy buys you time to figure out what to do about
your car loan, and it stops a repossession dead in its tracks
because of the automatic stay. The automatic stay makes all your
creditors cease their efforts to collect from you as long as you are
in bankruptcy. However, if you filed for bankruptcy in the past and
your case was dismissed because you didn’t comply with some
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
168

aspect of the bankruptcy process, the automatic stay lasts for just
30 days. (A bankruptcy judge may agree to extend it.)
Don’t even think about handling your own bankruptcy! It’s a com-
plicated process, and you won’t fully benefit from it if you try to
represent yourself. To locate a good bankruptcy attorney in your
area, go to the Web site of the National Association of Consumer
Bankruptcy Attorneys (NACBA) at www.nacba.org, or contact
your local or state bar association for a referral.
An attorney will help you figure out which type of bankruptcy you
must file — a Chapter 7 liquidation or a Chapter 13 reorganization —
based on your financial information and the requirements of the fed-
eral bankruptcy law. Most consumers file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy.
The attorney will also handle all the paperwork that a bankruptcy
involves, help you deal with your creditors, and be by your side
when you have to go to court.
Before you can file for bankruptcy, federal bankruptcy law requires
that you consult with a federally approved consumer credit coun-
seling agency and obtain a certificate of credit counseling comple-
tion from the agency. The consultation can take place in person, via
the Internet, or on the phone, and it must occur no less than 180
days before you file. To find a list of federally approved consumer
credit counseling agencies, go to the U.S. Trustee Program’s Web
site, www.usdoj.gov/ust. Click on “Credit Counseling & Debtor
Education” and then on “Approved Credit Counseling Agencies.”
However, say that a repossession is imminent and you need to file
for bankruptcy right away in order to avoid the loss of your vehi-
cle. Most bankruptcy attorneys allow consumers in this situation
to go through the credit counseling by phone or by computer at
their offices. It should take only about 10 or 15 minutes to com-
plete the counseling. After you’ve done so, the credit counseling
agency faxes or e-mails the certificate of credit counseling comple-
tion to the attorney’s office, at which point the attorney files your
bankruptcy paperwork with the court.
Benefiting from a Chapter 13 debt reorganization plan
By filing a Chapter 13 reorganization bankruptcy, you get up to 60
months to pay the remaining balance on your car loan, including
all past-due payments, interest owed, and late fees. At the start of
the bankruptcy, your attorney prepares your debt reorganization
plan, which details exactly how you intend to deal with each of
your outstanding debts, including your car loan. The bankruptcy
court must approve the plan.
Chapter 11: Keeping Your Wheels on the Road 169

After you have the court’s approval, you must pay all your debts
according to the plan. If you don’t, you risk having your bank-
ruptcy dismissed, which means that your auto lender could try
again to repossess your car.
Using Chapter 7 to hold on to your car
There are two ways that you can try to keep your car when you file
a Chapter 7 liquidation bankruptcy:
 Reaffirming your car loan: By reaffirming (if your lender
agrees to it), you continue paying on the loan according to
your original agreement with the lender. However, as a condi-
tion, after you sign the reaffirmation paperwork, you must pay
in one lump sum the full amount of your past-due loan pay-
ments, all late fees you owe, and possibly the fees the lender
had to pay its attorney as a result of your bankruptcy.
Your lender may agree to let you pay the amount of the loan
that is past due in installments rather than in a lump sum.
 Redeeming your car: To redeem your car, first you must
reach an agreement with the lender about the vehicle’s cur-
rent value, and then you pay that value immediately in a lump
sum. For example, say that you owe $10,000 on your vehicle,
and you and the lender agree that it is worth only $5,000. You
have to pay $5,000 to the lender. When you do, the lender
releases its lien on your vehicle, giving you clear title to it. In
other words, you own your car free and clear.
Unlike most other negative credit record information, which stays
on your record for seven and a half years, a Chapter 7 bankruptcy
lingers in your credit history for ten years.
For detailed information about how bankruptcy works, pick up a
copy of Personal Bankruptcy Laws For Dummies by James P. Caher
and John M. Caher (Wiley). You can also find out more about how
bankruptcy works by visiting the Web site of the American
Bankruptcy Institute (www.abiworld.org) and clicking on
“Consumer Education Center.”
Hiring an Attorney
A consumer law attorney can help you avoid a repossession and
can help even after a repossession has occurred.
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
170

Before you lose your car
Given how quickly a repossession can happen, ideally you want to
meet with a consumer law attorney as soon as you know that you
are going to have trouble keeping up with your car payments and
before you have missed a single payment. (In many states, one
missed payment can trigger repossession.) If you have already
missed payments, schedule a meeting right away. There may still
be time to prevent the loss of your car.
Bring your loan paperwork to the meeting so your attorney can
review it for possible problems. The attorney may be able to use
those problems to gain some bargaining power with your auto
lender (or to recommend that you sue).
What kinds of problems is an attorney looking for? The lender 
may have
 Violated the federal Truth in Lending Act when it gave you the
loan by not disclosing all the loan terms of credit.
 Not properly perfected its lien on your vehicle. If a lien is not
perfected, your lender may not be able to properly repossess
your vehicle. Your lender may actually be an unsecured credi-
tor, not a secured one, which means that the lender must get
the court’s permission to take your car back.
 Violated your state’s Deceptive Trade Practices Act or a simi-
lar law in your state by adding hidden charges to your loan.
 Charged you a higher interest rate than your state allows.
 Breached or broken your loan agreement. For example, the
lender may not have respected your loan agreement’s grace
period: a period of time after the payment due date during
which you can pay the loan without incurring a late fee and
without being considered in default.
The attorney will review your options for dealing with your car
loan problem in light of the terms of your loan agreement, the laws
of your state, and the details of your financial situation.
If the attorney advises you to file a lawsuit, she will probably agree
to represent you on a contingent fee basis. That means you won’t
pay the lawyer a fee regardless of whether you lose or win the law-
suit. Instead, if you win, the attorney takes her fee from the money
that the court awards you. Otherwise, the attorney does not get
anything.
Chapter 11: Keeping Your Wheels on the Road 171

If you have a different type of agreement with your attorney, you
may have to reimburse her for all court costs and expenses associ-
ated with your lawsuit no matter what the outcome of your lawsuit.
After repossession
Meet with a consumer law attorney as soon as your vehicle gets
taken to discuss your options for getting it back. Bring with you
the loan agreement, any records you kept of conversations you
had with your lender when you were trying to avoid repossession,
all paperwork related to the repossession, and any records you’ve
kept of expenses you incurred related to the repossession.
If the attorney concludes that your rights were violated when your
car was repossessed or sold, or that the lender violated some of
your other rights, he may be able to help you get your car back,
get the lender to agree to lower the amount of the deficiency you
pay, or get some other concessions. The attorney may also con-
clude that you should sue the lender and/or the repo man.
Finding an attorney
Here are two reliable resources for finding a consumer law attorney:

org or 617-523-8089
 National Association of Consumer Advocates in the District of
Columbia: www.naca.net or 202-452-1989
Your local or state bar association is another resource; most bar
associations provide attorney referrals.

Avoiding an Eviction and the
Loss of Your Utilities
In This Chapter
 Steering clear of an eviction
 Finding out about the eviction process
 Understanding the problems you may face post-eviction
 Keeping your utilities turned on
 Reestablishing utility service
W
hen you are struggling to make ends meet and you fall
behind on rent, probably the worst thing that can happen is
to receive an eviction notice. Suddenly, your bad dream is a full-
fledged nightmare. Your mind races as you try to figure out how
you can possibly come up with the money you need to stay where
you are living. If you conclude that it’s Mission Impossible, you’re
faced with the challenge of quickly finding somewhere else to live,
not to mention getting all your belongings packed up and moved
out, pronto. What a disaster!
We know that facing eviction is incredibly tough, especially if you
have children. In this chapter, we try to make the going a little
easier by explaining your alternatives for avoiding an eviction. We
hope you find one that works for you. If not, we help prepare for
what’s to come by explaining how an eviction works.
We also provide information about how to avoid having your utili-
ties terminated. We illuminate your options for keeping your lights
shining, the water running, your heat and air conditioning blowing,
and your phone functioning. We provide an overview of the utility
termination process, from the initial notice you receive about your
past-due bill to the steps you must take to get your service back on
after it’s been terminated. We also discuss how your state Public
Utility Commission fits into the picture.

Keeping a Roof over Your Head
Throughout this chapter, we use the word apartment to refer to the
place you live, whether it’s actually an apartment or it’s a duplex,
condo, or home. Our advice applies to any rental property.
You probably signed a lease with your landlord before you moved
in. The lease is a contract that spells out the obligations you have
to your landlord and vice versa. It indicates the start and end dates
of the rental contract; the amount of rent you must pay each
month; the amount of money you must put up as a security
deposit; and all the other terms and conditions of your lease,
including when you can be evicted.
Don’t assume that your landlord won’t evict you because you have a
history of paying your rent on time or because you think that your
landlord likes you. Ultimately, your relationship with your landlord
is a financial one. If you miss rent payments (even one), your land-
lord will make a dollars-and-cents decision about what to do.
The laws of your state determine the specific details of the eviction
process in your area. However, we can safely say that when an
eviction begins, the process moves quickly; you won’t have a lot 
of time to find a new place to live unless you can slow the process
down or even stop it.
Keep in mind that being evicted makes it harder for you to find 
a new place to live. The new landlord will probably run a credit
check as part of the application process, and your current landlord
has probably reported your late payments and eviction to the
national credit bureaus. If you find a landlord who will rent to 
you despite your credit history, you may have to pay a larger than
usual security deposit and/or get another adult to cosign (and be
responsible for) your lease.
For these reasons (and others), you want to avoid eviction at all
costs. Evaluate your options for dealing with your rent as soon 
as you realize you can’t keep up with it. Act quickly to pursue
whichever option you think is best. Your options may include
 Paying your past due rent immediately.
 Negotiating with your landlord.
 Terminating your lease.
 Breaking your lease.
 Subleasing your apartment or finding someone to assume
your lease.
 Getting a roommate.
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
174

In the following sections, we detail each option so you can con-
sider which may work best for you.
If you are already in jeopardy of being evicted, meet with a landlord–
tenant attorney so you can find out about your state’s eviction law,
review your lease to see what it says about evictions, and talk about
your options. If you cannot afford to pay for an attorney, get in touch
with your local tenant’s council or your local or state bar associa-
tion. The tenant’s council can advise you of your rights and may be
able to refer you to a low-cost/no-cost attorney. Another alternative
is to contact the Legal Aid Society in your area; a Legal Aid attorney
will help you for free.
Paying your past-due rent
Getting caught up on your past-due rent is the most obvious way
to avoid being evicted. However, when money is tight, that can be
easier said than done.
If you know that your finances are about to take a positive turn (so
you’ll be able to keep up with your rent), you may want to borrow
money from a friend or relative to pay your past-due rent. You may
also want a loan if you intend to move out of your apartment but
need more time to find a new place to live.
If you do not want to ask someone you know for the money, you
may qualify for help from a nonprofit or government agency in
your area that provides emergency housing assistance. Contact
your local, county, or state housing or welfare agency. Your church
may be another option.
Negotiating a way to stay
Maybe you truly believe that your money problems will be short
lived; you’ve looked at your budget (Chapter 4) and your financial
prospects, and you know that things will improve in a few months.
If you are certain that you won’t have trouble paying your rent
after your problems are over, talk with your landlord about making
reduced rent payments for a while. Your landlord may agree if you
can convince him that your financial prognosis is good and if you
have had a good rent payment history until now. However, if
you’ve been a problem tenant — paying your rent late, having
noisy parties, making unreasonable demands, and so on — don’t
hold your breath waiting for a “yes.” Your landlord may be happy
to show you the door.
Chapter 12: Avoiding an Eviction and the Loss of Your Utilities 175

You may have a more difficult time negotiating a way to remain in
your apartment if your landlord is a big bureaucratic company
rather than an individual who maintains a direct relationship with
his tenants.
If your landlord is willing to let you make smaller rent payments for
a limited period of time, get the terms of your agreement in writing.
Be sure the agreement addresses all the following:
 The amount of the reduced payments.
 The duration of the reduced payments.
 When you will be in default of the agreement
 The consequences of a default.
 How and when you must pay any rent that is already past due.
Your landlord may agree to take the money out of your secu-
rity deposit, but if your security deposit won’t cover it all, you
need to agree how you’ll make up the balance. Many landlords
prefer to reserve security deposits to pay for cleaning and
repairing an apartment after a tenant moves out, so your 
landlord may expect you to pay your past-due rent in full.
 How you’ll make up the difference between your normal
monthly rent and what you will be paying. Your landlord may
want you to pay the difference in a lump sum by a certain
date, or he may expect you to pay a little extra each month
after you resume making regular rent payments. Some (but
not many) landlords will agree to deduct the difference from
your security deposit and then look to you to make up what-
ever money you may still owe.
 Whether you must pay an additional security deposit.
Terminating your lease
If your lease is month to month (unlike most leases, which last for
a year), you can end it at any time for any reason, as long as you
do so according to the terms of the lease. After the lease is legally
terminated, your landlord cannot hold you responsible for any
future rent payments.
Most month-to-month leases require that you give your landlord at
least 30 days written notice of your termination plans. However, if
you rented the apartment with a longer lease that has become a
month-to-month lease, be sure you look at the lease agreement.
Some landlords require 60 days notice given at the end of the
month. If you give notice at the beginning of a month, it could be
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
176

three months before you can legally move out without breaking the
terms of the lease.
After you give notice, your landlord is entitled to any back rent 
or late fees you owe, and to be reimbursed for any damage you
have done to your apartment. Your landlord deducts the fees and
expenses from your security deposit and is required to send you
any money left from the deposit within the period of time specified
in your lease. (If you break a lease, do not expect to get your
deposit back.) If the security deposit does not cover everything
you owe, your lease probably entitles your landlord to ask you for
the difference. If you do not pay it, your landlord may sue you. See
the sidebar “The skinny on security deposits” in this chapter to
find out how security deposits work.
Breaking your lease
Sometimes, breaking your lease can be a good way to avoid an
eviction. When you break your lease, you move out before the term
of the lease is up and before the landlord files an eviction suit.
If your lease is almost up, and depending on its terms and the laws
of your state, it may cost you less to finish out the lease than to
break it. (This assumes that you can come up with the money to
stay there until the lease ends.)
Before you break your lease, read it carefully to see if it spells out 
a specific break-your-lease process and the consequences of not
following that process. Among other things, your lease may require
you to give your landlord a certain amount of advance notice
about your plans, and it may obligate you to continue paying 
rent until your landlord finds someone to replace you as a tenant.
However, your state requires your landlord to find a new tenant 
as quickly as possible.
Your lease may also give your landlord the right to be reimbursed
for the expenses he incurs trying to find a new tenant: the cost of a
newspaper ad, for example. However, in many leases, reletting fees
are a set amount.
Breaking your lease won’t release you from your obligation to 
pay your landlord any past-due rent you owe before you move out.
Unless you pay that debt, your landlord deducts it from your secu-
rity deposit together with any late fees and other expenses you owe.
If your security deposit is not large enough to cover everything, you
must pay the balance (unless your landlord decides to waive it).
Chapter 12: Avoiding an Eviction and the Loss of Your Utilities 177

Depending on your state, if you break your lease and your landlord
can’t rent your apartment for as much as you were paying, he can
look to you to make up the difference until your lease term is up.
Renting your apartment 
to someone else
Subleasing your apartment may be another way to avoid an evic-
tion, depending on the terms of your lease. When you sublease to
someone, that person (the sublessee) moves into your apartment
and pays the rent according to the terms of your lease. However,
because your lease remains in effect until its term is up, if the sub-
lessee stops paying the rent, your landlord can hold you liable for
the missed payments. Also, the landlord can hold you responsible
for any other lease violations the sublessee may commit, such as
trashing the apartment and refusing to pay for the damage.
Before you begin the sublease process, read your lease to confirm
that it allows subleasing and, if it does, whether you must comply
with any special requirements or conditions. For example, most
leases (and some state laws) require tenants to get upfront
approval from their landlords before they sublet their apartments.
You risk being evicted if you don’t get that approval. Also, your
lease may entitle your landlord to meet whomever you are thinking
about subleasing to, and it may require the sublessee to pay an
additional security deposit.
If your lease does not allow you to sublet your apartment, your
landlord may okay such an arrangement anyway. For example, she
may agree to it if she is convinced that you cannot afford to con-
tinue paying your rent; subleasing may be the quickest and best
way for her to guarantee a reliable flow of rental income.
Screening candidates
Obviously, if you are going to sublease your apartment, it’s criti-
cally important to screen applicants so you can feel confident that
the person you choose will be a responsible tenant. This goes for
friends, relatives, and casual acquaintances — not just for
strangers.
Ask anyone who wants to sublease your apartment to complete a
written application. The application should ask for current contact
information, including address, phone number, and e-mail address;
personal and rental references; occupation; monthly income; and
employer name and contact information. Confirm the application
information, and check the references. It’s also a good idea to run 
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
178

a background check on anyone you are considering seriously. For
between about $10 and $35 (depending on the amount of detail 
you want), the background check will tell you about an applicant’s
rent payment history, whether the applicant has a criminal history,
and more.
Putting a sublease in writing
When you find someone to sublease to, prepare a written agree-
ment. At a minimum, it should state the following:
 The amount of rent the sublessee must pay each month and
the rent due date
 The amount of any security deposit your landlord may require
from the sublessee
 All other lease obligations of the sublessee
 The duration of the sublease agreement
 The process that the sublessee must follow if he wants to stop
subleasing before your agreement is up
 The consequences of breaking the agreement
Considering similar options
Your lease may allow you to let someone assume it, which is a
better alternative than subleasing because the person who
assumes your lease becomes legally liable for it. In other words,
you give up all your interest in the lease. If the person who
assumes your lease breaks the lease, your former landlord cannot
hold you responsible for any money owed. (This presumes that
you get a release from the lease when the other person assumes it;
check your lease agreement to make sure that’s the case.)
Another alternative is for your landlord to give the new renter 
a totally new lease and allow you to terminate your own lease 
without having to pay any penalties. If you save the landlord the
expense and hassle of finding a good tenant, she may be willing to
take this option.
Sharing your space
Finding a roommate to split the cost of your rent and utilities may
be the perfect answer to your problem. Before you let someone
move in with you, be sure that your lease allows you to have a
roommate. If it does, be clear about any rights your landlord may
have, such as the right to approve a roommate before he moves in.
If you violate the terms of your lease, you may face eviction.
Chapter 12: Avoiding an Eviction and the Loss of Your Utilities 179

If you get a roommate, your landlord may be entitled to cancel
your current lease so the two of you can sign a new lease as legal
co-tenants. As co-tenants, you share equal responsibility for com-
plying with the lease terms. This means, among other things, that
you are equally responsible for the entire amount of your rent even
though you are sharing the cost. If one of you cannot come up with
his share of the rent or if one of you moves out suddenly, the other
is legally obligated to pay the full amount of the rent due.

Tips for finding a roommate or sublessee
Sharing your place with a roommate or subleasing it can be a great way to avoid an
eviction. But either arrangement can blow up in your face if you are not careful
about who you choose. Follow these steps to minimize your risk:
 Ask your friends, family members, and business associates for referrals.
However, assuming that birds of a feather may flock together, don’t ask for a
referral from anyone who has a bad rental track record, is an overspender, or
is unreliable.
 Prepare an ad that plays up the selling points of your apartment. Focus on fea-
tures that make it most attractive, such as its size, location, and amenities. The
ad should also provide basic information such as the monthly rent, the amount
of any security deposit, and when someone can move in.
Advertise your apartment on Web sites like www.craigslist.org and www.
sublet.com. You may also want to place an ad in your local daily paper or
your community weekly paper (or in your college or university newspaper if you
are a student).
 Post notices about your apartment on community bulletin boards.
 Take digital photos of your apartment. You can include them in any online ads
you post and send them to anyone who expresses interest.
 Clean your apartment thoroughly and get rid of clutter before you show it to
anyone. Your apartment should make a good first impression.
 Schedule appointments so anyone interested can see your apartment and so
the two of you can meet.
 Have applications available for anyone interested. Verify all the application
information, check references, and run a background check on anyone you are
seriously considering. Also, if you are looking for a sublessee, have a copy of
your lease available for applicants to review so they know what their obliga-
tions would be (such as paying the first and last month’s rent).

If your landlord wants you and your roommate to sign a new lease
as co-tenants, make sure that she is not going to raise your rent.
Such an increase may undermine the very reason you’re going to
have a roommate — to lower your monthly rent expense.
Your landlord may also expect you to pay an additional security
deposit if a second person moves in. If so, try to get your room-
mate to pay it because you’ve already put one deposit down.
Finding a compatible roommate
If you need to find a roommate (see the sidebar “Tips for finding a
roommate or sublessee”), first make a list of the qualities you do
and don’t want in a roommate. Going through this exercise can
increase the likelihood that you’ll end up with someone you’re 
compatible with. For example, if you like peace and quiet at the 
end of the day, avoid someone who likes to party a lot or is used to
having friends over all the time. If you’re a neatnik, avoid living with
a slob or else you’ll feel like you’re in an episode of The Odd Couple.
Ask anyone who applies to be your roommate to complete a rental
application; see the earlier section “Screening candidates” for
advice about what the application should contain. Spend some
time with each applicant so you can get a sense of whether that
person fits the bill. If you get a bad feeling about someone, no
matter how good he or she looks on paper, trust your gut and
don’t room with that person.
Discussing the business of living together
After you find a roommate, discuss how the two of you will manage
the practical aspects of living together. For example,
 How will the rent get paid each month? Will you each write a
check for one-half of the rent, or will one of you write a check
for the full amount and get reimbursed by the other?
 Does the roommate have to pay you the first and last 
month’s rent?
 Who will pay any additional security deposit your landlord
may require?
 How will you share joint expenses like the bills for utilities,
cable, and Internet service?
 How much notice must your roommate give you if she decides
to move out before your lease is up, and what does she owe
you financially if she does?
 Under what circumstances can you ask your roommate to
leave if you decide that living together isn’t working out?
Chapter 12: Avoiding an Eviction and the Loss of Your Utilities 181

 Is your roommate obligated to help you find an acceptable
new roommate if she moves out before your lease is up?
 How will you share the housework?
 If you are going to share a home, how will you divvy up any
chores your landlord doesn’t handle, such as mowing the yard
and shoveling snow?
Talk through these and any other issues you think are important to
address, and put answers down on paper. Doing so helps minimize
the potential for misunderstandings and conflict and makes it
easier to resolve any problems that may arise. Be sure that both of
you sign and date the agreement and that you each have a copy.
You may want to have a landlord–tenant attorney review the agree-
ment you draft before you ask your roommate to sign it. That way,
you can be sure it protects you adequately from potential prob-
lems, especially if there is a lot of money involved.
If you and your roommate sign a new lease with your landlord and
then your roommate breaks the lease by moving out early, your
landlord may have the right to ask you to leave. If the lease gives
your roommate the right to sublease to someone, the agreement
between the two of you should require your roommate to find a
sublessee before moving out (assuming that the landlord approves
the sublease).
Facing Eviction
You’ve tried everything you can think of to avoid being evicted, but
the writing is on the wall. Now you need to get up to speed on how
evictions work.
Before we tell you how evictions generally work (the process can
be a little different depending on the details of your state’s eviction
law), you need to know that after the process begins, it moves
quickly. An eviction may take just a few weeks to complete, and if 
a court orders you to vacate your apartment, you may have just a
few days to move out. If you are concerned about being evicted,
begin looking for a new place to live immediately, and be prepared
for your housing hunt to take time; most landlords won’t rent to
you because you’re being evicted.
Also, begin planning now for how you’ll come up with the money
to pay a new security deposit. Being evicted means that you won’t
get back the security deposit you paid to your current landlord.
Plus, your new landlord may require you to put down a larger than
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
182

usual deposit given your rental history. (He may also require that
you have another adult cosign your lease.)
If you need to move out of your apartment right away but can’t yet
afford to pay a security deposit or monthly rent, start talking to rel-
atives and friends about staying with one of them until you get
back on your financial feet.
Receiving a warning
Before an eviction can begin, your landlord sends you either a
notice to pay or vacate or a notice to vacate. If you receive the first
type of notice, your landlord is giving you an opportunity to avoid
an eviction by paying what you owe. If you receive the second 
type of notice, your landlord is telling you that he wants you out,
period. The first notice will indicate the date by which you must
pay or make payment arrangements in order to continue living in
your apartment, and the date by which you and all your belongings
must be out if you cannot come up with the money. The second
notice just tells you when you must be out.
Assuming you receive a notice to pay or vacate, you can respond
in one of several ways. Your best response depends on such things
as your short- and long-term financial prospects, the terms of your
lease, and your relationship with your landlord.
Paying what you owe
Obviously, a good response to an imminent eviction is to pay your
landlord what you owe by the due date. Not only do you avoid
being evicted, but you also buy yourself some time to either move
out on your own terms or pursue one of the options we describe in
the earlier section “Keeping a Roof over Your Head.” However, if
you have not been able to come up with rent money before now,
you probably won’t come up with it when the notice arrives.
Moving out by the vacate date
Moving out won’t let you off the hook for your past-due rent or for
any fees your landlord may be entitled to collect, such as late fees
and bounced check fees. In addition, you lose your security deposit.
If your security deposit is not large enough to cover everything
you owe, your landlord may be entitled to ask you to make up the
difference. If so, talk to your landlord about whether you can pay
the difference in installments. If not, unless you can figure out a
way to come up with the money, your landlord may turn your debt
over to a debt collector or even sue you for it, especially if the
amount you owe is substantial.
Chapter 12: Avoiding an Eviction and the Loss of Your Utilities 183

Disputing the amount that your landlord says you owe
If you disagree with the amount of money that the warning notice
says you must pay in order to avoid being evicted, talk to your
landlord and write her a letter stating how much you think you
really owe. Attach to the letter copies of any documentation you
have that helps make your argument, such as copies of past rent
checks endorsed by your landlord or correspondence from your
landlord. Make a copy of your letter for your files, and send the
original letter with copies of the documentation to your landlord
via certified mail. Request a return receipt so you know when your
landlord received the letter.
Getting a summons from the court
If the eviction process moves forward, your landlord files a com-
plaint with your local small claims court, housing court, justice of
the peace court, or whatever low-level court in your area handles
evictions. The complaint states why your landlord thinks you
should be evicted.
After the complaint is filed, an eviction hearing is scheduled. The
court sends you a summons (which is usually served by a consta-
ble) officially notifying you that your eviction has begun. The sum-
mons also indicates the date of your eviction hearing or trial.
If you are not already working with a landlord–tenant attorney, con-
tact one immediately. Don’t delay: You may have only a few days to
respond to the court’s notice. If you can’t afford to pay an attorney
and your income is low enough, contact your local Legal Aid Society.
Depending on the facts of your situation, the attorney may advise
you to do one of the following:
 Fight the eviction. Tell the judge why you should not have to
move out or why your landlord should give you more time to
catch up on your rent. The judge may sympathize with your
situation and ask your landlord to try to work something out
so you can stay put or at least have additional time to find a
new place to rent. (For example, maybe the school year is
almost over, and you need a few extra weeks to keep your chil-
dren in school. Or maybe the rental market in your area is very
tight, and you need more time to find another apartment.)
To fight your eviction, you may have to file an answer or
response to your landlord’s lawsuit by the deadline on the
summons. However, in some jurisdictions, you can just show
up in court on the date of your trial and indicate that you
intend to fight the eviction.
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
184

 Settle with your landlord. Your landlord may agree to drop
his lawsuit if you agree to do certain things by a set date, such
as pay all the past-due rent that you owe and move out. Get
the terms and conditions of any agreement in writing.
 Do nothing. If you do not respond to the court summons and
you don’t show up in court on the trial date, the court will
probably award your landlord a default judgment against you.
That means that the landlord gets the right to make you move
out by the date set by the judge.
If you don’t show up for your trial, you forfeit your right to defend
yourself against any lies or misleading statements your landlord
may make, and you give up the opportunity to ask your landlord
questions that may be helpful to you in the lawsuit. Also, you can’t
ask the court for extra time to move out.
When you do appear in court, dress neatly and conservatively. You
don’t have to wear a power suit, but you should avoid plunging
necklines, short skirts, tight pants, jeans, shorts, and T-shirts.
Being removed from your home
If your landlord wins the lawsuit, you will probably receive a court
notice telling you the date by which you must be out of your apart-
ment. The deadline probably won’t be very long after the judge
issues his decision. If the notice contains anything you don’t
understand, talk with your attorney; get an explanation from the
office of your local constable, sheriff, or marshal (whichever one
enforces evictions in your area); or ask the court clerk’s office.
If you don’t have a place to move to yet, find one immediately. In the
meantime, ask your attorney whether she thinks you can get the
eviction delayed or cancelled. For example, the attorney may sug-
gest that you formally appeal the court’s decision. If you do, a higher
court will hear your request for an appeal. If the judge in that court
decides that you are entitled to appeal, your eviction is put on hold,
and another eviction trial is scheduled. You may not win the second
trial either, but at least you get more time to find a new place to live.
The downside is that you may have to pay a bond to appeal.
What if your eviction moves forward, and you and your belongings
are still in your residence on the date by which you are supposed
to be gone? A local constable, sheriff, or marshal comes to your
home, asks you to leave, and usually moves all your belongings
into storage. Sometimes, depending on your jurisdiction, your
belongings are just moved to the curb. At this point, you are break-
ing the law if you reenter your home without the permission of the
landlord or the court, and you could be taken to jail.
Chapter 12: Avoiding an Eviction and the Loss of Your Utilities 185

When your belongings are in storage, you have to contact the
moving and storage company and make arrangements to reim-
burse it for its moving and storage costs. Do so quickly: After
about 30 days, the moving and storage company will begin selling
your things.
Remaining on the hook 
for the money you owe
After you’ve been evicted, your landlord may sue you for any past-
due rent you still owe and for any late fees and other expenses
your lease says he is entitled to. Contact a landlord–tenant attor-
ney right away if you are sued. The attorney may be able to con-
vince the landlord to drop the lawsuit in exchange for you paying a
substantial portion of the money you owe, or in exchange for you
giving the landlord an asset you own as payment.
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
186
The skinny on security deposits
Usually, when you sign a lease agreement, you must give your landlord a security
deposit. Then when you legally move out of your apartment, you are entitled to any
money left in the deposit after all deductions. (Your state or locality may also enti-
tle you to receive interest on the deposit.) Depending on the terms of your lease and
your state’s law, the deductions may include unpaid past-due rent and fees, plus
the cost of any repairs, maintenance, and cleaning that are beyond normal wear
and tear.
Your landlord must provide you with a written itemization of all the deductions taken
from your security deposit. You are entitled to receive the itemization within a cer-
tain amount of time after you move out — usually no less than two weeks and no
more than one month.
If you do not receive the security deposit money you believe you are entitled to
and/or the itemized accounting by the required deadline, send a polite letter to your
landlord requesting it. If your landlord does not respond or refuses to send you the
money or to provide you with the itemized accounting, get legal advice. The attor-
ney may recommend sending a demand letter on his letterhead to the landlord, and
the landlord may respond with what you are asking for. Otherwise, you may have to
sue the landlord. If you sue for a relatively small amount of money, you can file your
lawsuit in small claims court and handle the case yourself. However, if you want to
sue for the itemized accounting, you must sue in another court because you can
sue only for money in small claims court.

If the lawsuit moves forward and your former landlord wins a 
judgment against you, the landlord can ask the court for permis-
sion to collect on the judgment by garnishing your wages, taking
one or more of your assets, or putting a lien on one of your assets.
However, if wage garnishment is illegal in your state and if you own
no assets of any value (or if all your assets are exempt from the
landlord’s collection actions), your landlord is out of luck because
you are judgment proof.
Maintaining Your Essential 
Utility Services
You rely on utility companies every minute of every day. They light
your home and power your appliances. They keep the temperature
just right. They let water flow from your faucets and flush waste
down your toilets. They keep you connected to the outside world
through telephones and computers. Doing without one or more of
these services is not just inconvenient; it may be dangerous to
your family’s health and safety.
Knowing the players
Most companies that provide utility services are investor-owned,
for-profit businesses. In most states, they are regulated by state
Public Utility Commissions (PUCs), sometimes known as Public
Service Commissions. However, in some states, the utilities that
provide your gas, water, and wastewater services are regulated by
different government agencies. Visit your state PUC Web site or call
your PUC to find out about the specific utility services it regulates.
You may receive your electric power, water, and wastewater from a
municipal utility. If you live in a rural area, your electric power may
be provided by an electric rural cooperative, which is a private,
nonprofit utility owned and operated by its members. Most state
PUCs have no jurisdiction over municipal utilities or electric rural
cooperatives.
Regardless of who provides your utility services, if you are having a
tough time paying your utility bills, you may receive a notice from
one or more of them threatening you with the loss of your service.
(Maybe you’ve even had your service terminated for nonpayment.)
In the sections that follow, we explain your options for avoiding the
loss of your utility services, focusing on investor-owned utilities, and
we provide a general explanation of how the termination process
works, including the appeals process. If your utility is municipally
Chapter 12: Avoiding an Eviction and the Loss of Your Utilities 187

owned or a rural electric cooperative, contact its customer service
office to find out how the utility handles terminations.
We don’t discuss wireless phone or cellphone companies in this
chapter because they are minimally regulated by individual states,
which means they are not held to the same standards as traditional
phone companies when it comes to service terminations, appeals,
and so on. With no tough consumer-oriented regulations that apply
to the wireless industry, you are pretty much at the mercy of your
wireless company if you can’t afford to pay your cell phone bills.
Avoiding a termination
When you fall behind on a utility bill, the utility sends you a series
of notices asking you to pay the outstanding balance. The timing
and number of the notices is regulated by your state PUC or by
some other state regulatory agency. Initially, the notices are part of
your monthly statements. If you don’t pay what you owe or make
payment arrangements with the utility, you’ll probably begin
receiving separate notices. Eventually, a final termination notice
arrives. At about the same time, someone with the utility company
may also call to warn you that you’re about to lose your service
and to advise you of how you can stop the termination.
The final notice indicates the date on which your service will be
disconnected and the date by which you can pay the total amount
due to avoid the termination. It lists the reason for the termination,
the amount of any reconnection fees you have to pay, and a
number to call if you want to speak with someone about the money
you owe. The notice also either spells out your termination rights
and remedies, including your right to appeal a termination before
or after you lose your service, or provides a number to call to find
out about them.
When you receive a final notice, it’s not too late to avoid having
your service disconnected, assuming you act immediately. A gov-
ernment program, a local charity, or even your utility company
itself may have programs that can help you with your bill.
Asking for help
Resources in your community may be able to help you keep your
utilities on. Some provide emergency assistance when you are
about to have a utility service terminated. Others provide help
paying your utility bills each month for a limited period of time,
assuming you qualify.
Each resource has its own criteria regarding whom it will help and
under what conditions. For example, some resources help only
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
188

people with very low incomes, while others offer assistance only
when utility bills are the highest — in the summer or winter, for
example. If you apply for assistance from one resource and are
turned down, apply to another for help.
When you apply for assistance, be prepared to share basic infor-
mation about your finances, such as your monthly income and
expenses, as well as proof of your income (a pay stub will probably
do). You may have to provide additional financial information as well,
depending on whom you apply to and the kind of help you ask for.
Most government agencies and nonprofit organizations that offer
utility bill assistance do not help consumers pay their water and
wastewater bills or their phone bills.
Check into the following community resources when you can’t
keep up with your utility bills:
 The utility you are having problems paying: It may have 
a special fund for helping qualified customers keep up with
their utility bills. Call the utility’s customer service office to
find out if it does and if you qualify for help.
 Your state PUC: Some PUCs offer limited financial assistance
to qualified consumers who are having problems staying cur-
rent on their utility bills. They can also refer you to other
sources of assistance.
 Your state, county, or local human services or housing
agency: If these agencies cannot help you, they can refer you
to other possible sources of help.
 Your state or local Low Income Home Energy Assistance
Program (LIHEAP): This program helps income-eligible con-
sumers pay their heating and cooling bills for a limited period
of time. The program is funded by the federal government and
administered by local and state governments. For more infor-
mation about LIHEAP and how to apply for program assis-
tance, read the sidebar “Look to LIHEAP.”
Most LIHEAPs do not help pay your light or water bills. Also,
every year, the federal government allocates a limited amount
of money to LIHEAP. So depending on when you apply for help
from the program, there may not be any money left.
 A local charity: Some community-based nonprofits provide
direct services to low-income individuals and families. These
services may include food; clothing; and assistance paying for
basic needs like food, shelter, and utility service.
 A church in your area: Some churches help needy people pay
their bills.
Chapter 12: Avoiding an Eviction and the Loss of Your Utilities 189

If you are elderly, you may be eligible to receive help from a local or
state government agency or from a community-based organization 
in your area that focuses on assisting older adults. To locate such
assistance, use the Eldercare Locator sponsored by the U.S.
Administration on Aging. Call 800- 677-1116 between 9 a.m. and 8 p.m.
eastern time, Monday through Friday, or go to www.eldercare.gov.
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
190
Look to LIHEAP
If your income is low enough and you are in jeopardy of losing your ability to heat
or cool your home because you have fallen behind on your utility bill, the Low
Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, may be able to help.
The program is funded by the federal government and administered by individual
states or local governments. Eligibility criteria for LIHEAP assistance, as well as
levels of assistance, vary from state to state and even from community to commu-
nity. In addition to helping eligible consumers pay their utility bills, some LIHEAPs
also help consumers reduce their future bills by helping finance the cost of weath-
erizing their homes or making energy-related repairs.
To obtain contact information for the government agency that runs the LIHEAP in your
area, go to www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/liheap/grantees/states.
html or call the National Energy Assistance Referral project (NEAR) at
886-674-6327. Another way to obtain the information is to send an e-mail message
that includes your name, as well as the name of your city, county, and state, to the
National Center for Appropriate Technology at energyassistance@ncat.org.
If you meet the eligibility requirements for the LIHEAP in your area and decide to
apply for assistance, be prepared to provide program staff with the following:
 Copies of your last several utility bills
 Proof of your household’s gross income(income before taxes and other deductions)
 Documentation showing how much you receive from other sources of income,
such as Social Security, the federal Supplemental Security Income program, unem-
ployment insurance, state assistance programs, a private pension, and so on
 A termination notice you may have received from your utility
 Proof of your current address
 Proof of the number of individuals living in your household and a Social Security
card for each of them
 Proof that you are a U.S. citizen or permanent resident
If you do not qualify for LIHEAP assistance, or if you qualify but need more assistance
as well, ask LIHEAP staff about other possible sources of help in your community.

Setting up a payment plan
If you can afford to pay something on your past-due bill each month
in order to get caught up, review your budget (see Chapter 4) to
determine exactly how much you can pay. Then contact your 
utility’s customer service department to discuss a payment plan. 
If your past-due balance is not substantial and you can afford to 
pay it off according to the standard formula your utility uses to 
calculate monthly payment plan amounts, you may be able to set
up a plan over the phone.
If the amount the utility wants you to pay based on its standard
formula is more than you think you can afford, ask for a more
lenient payment plan. To apply for lower monthly payments, you
have to fill out an application. When the utility reviews your appli-
cation, it takes into account such factors as the amount of your
past-due bill, how long the money has been past due, your utility
bill paying history, your income relative to your expenses, the size
of your family, and how much you can afford to pay on your debt
each month.
Maintain a written record of every conversation you have related
to your request for a payment plan. Note the name and title of each
person you speak to, the date of the conversation, and what was
said. If you reach an agreement about a payment plan, record the
terms of the agreement, and then compare what you wrote down
to the terms of the plan agreement that you receive from the utility.
If the agreement contains anything that you do not understand or
you didn’t agree to, or if the agreement does not reflect something
that the utility representative promised, get in touch with the
person who helped you work out the plan.
If you get nowhere with the first person you speak to about a pay-
ment plan, ask to talk to his supervisor. If you strike out with the
supervisor too, you can ask the PUC for help. The next section
explains how the PUC can help.
If you and your utility cannot work out a payment plan that you
can afford and that is acceptable to the utility, you may be out of
luck. Although the utility must try to come up with a plan that
meets your needs, it is not obligated to agree to one that makes
your monthly payments too small and that is going to take too 
long to complete.
If a termination is imminent and you have run out of options, you
may want to appeal to your state PUC. Don’t dawdle! Most states
limit the amount of time you have to file an appeal. In some states,
you have only one week to appeal after your utility notifies you of
its final decision. Another option for avoiding a termination is to
file for bankruptcy, which we discuss later in this chapter.
Chapter 12: Avoiding an Eviction and the Loss of Your Utilities 191

Before you agree to any installment payment plan, make sure that
you understand all its terms and conditions. For example, the util-
ity may require you to make a lump sum payment on your utility
debt as a condition of setting up the plan. If you do not have the
money to make the payment, one of the resources we list in the
previous section may be able to help you.
Depending on your state, if you don’t live up to the terms of your
payment plan, your utility does not have to agree to give you
another one; it can cut off your service unless you pay what you
owe. Also, when you default on the plan, the termination process
may be accelerated.
A resource of information about your utility rights is your state
utility advocate. This person is usually located within the office of
your state attorney general.
Appealing to your state PUC
If you do not agree with a decision your utility makes (and your
utility refuses to change its stance), or if you believe that your 
utility has violated your rights (and it denies that it did anything
wrong), you can take your case to your state PUC, assuming it 
regulates the utility company in question.
To appeal a decision that a municipally owned utility makes, get in
touch with your local mayor, city council members, and/or city
manager. If your problem is with an electric cooperative, contact
the cooperative to find out how to appeal.
You may want to contact the PUC if you and your utility are unable
to work out an affordable payment plan or if you disagree with the
amount of money it says you must pay to avoid a termination, for
example. You can file an appeal with the PUC to try to avoid a ter-
mination. When you do, your utility must suspend the termination
process. (It can reactivate that process if you lose your appeal.)
You can also appeal a termination after it happens.
Starting the process
Most PUCs allow you to file an appeal in writing or by phone. Some
also allow you to file online. Filing in writing is best because you have
a written record of exactly what you said and what you asked for.
After the PUC receives your appeal, a staff person reviews it. She
may try to resolve your problem administratively, or she may send
you a letter indicating that the PUC cannot help you or that your
utility company did nothing wrong.
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
192

If you don’t like what the PUC decides, you can submit a written
request asking to have your complaint reviewed at a higher level.
In your letter, explain why an additional review is merited. Your
justification must be more than simply, “I don’t like the PUC’s first
decision.” You must be able to argue that your utility violated your
rights or did not follow the prescribed termination process to the
letter, that the PUC did not adequately review your initial com-
plaint, and so on.
If the PUC agrees to the review, you may have to attend a dispute
resolution meeting or conference. If your problem does not get
resolved, you can request a formal hearing.
Holding a hearing
Most PUC hearings are more informal than trials; a hearing does 
not occur in a courtroom, and the rules and procedures are more
relaxed than in a trial. Usually, an administrative law judge presides
over the hearing, and you and a representative of your utility com-
pany are given opportunities to present your sides of the issue.
You can represent yourself at the hearing, or you can have a con-
sumer law attorney represent you. If you represent yourself, it is a
good idea to meet with an attorney or with a utility counselor. This
person can explain the hearing process to you, review the kinds of
questions you are likely to be asked, and discuss possible hearing
outcomes. Having this information ahead of time can help alleviate
any anxiety you feel about the hearing process and make you a
more effective advocate for yourself.
Prior to the hearing, gather up any records you have that help 
support your side of the issue. For example, if you claim that the
amount your utility company says is past due is incorrect, bring
proof of what you have paid on past utility bills. If you claim that
your service should not be terminated because someone in your
family is too ill to do without the service even for a day or two, get
a letter from your family member’s doctor stating that fact. You
may also be entitled to have witnesses attend the hearing and give
testimony on your behalf.
At the end of the hearing, the judge makes a decision. If you do not
like the decision and it means that a termination is imminent, you
may want to file for bankruptcy to stop it (assuming you still
cannot come up with the money you need).
Chapter 12: Avoiding an Eviction and the Loss of Your Utilities 193

Filing for bankruptcy
Filing for bankruptcy is an extreme step to prevent the loss of your
utility service. However, if you have pursued other options without
success, you may be left with no alternative. You can use bank-
ruptcy not just to keep your utility service on but also to get rid of
your past-due utility debt, regardless of whether you file a Chapter
13 reorganization bankruptcy or a Chapter 7 liquidation bankruptcy.
However, no later than 20 days after the start of your bankruptcy,
you must pay the utility a “reasonable” deposit — usually two to
three months’ worth of payments — to continue your service.
If you are considering bankruptcy, you must go through credit
counseling with a federally approved credit counseling agency no
more than six months before you file. When you do, you get a cer-
tificate to permit the filing of the bankruptcy. However, if you have
to file right away and you have not yet gone through the counsel-
ing, you can probably get the required counseling at the office of
your bankruptcy attorney by phone or online. (If you are in this sit-
uation and have not yet hired an attorney, ask the attorney you are
considering hiring if completing the counseling in her office is an
option. If not, look for a different attorney.) The credit counseling
agency will fax or e-mail the certificate you need to your attorney
who, in turn, will file your bankruptcy for you. Usually, all of this
can be done in the same day.
As soon as you know the writing is on the wall and filing for bank-
ruptcy is inevitable, meet with a bankruptcy attorney to find out
how the process works and to figure out whether you can file a
Chapter 7 or a Chapter 13. The attorney will also help you com-
plete all the bankruptcy paperwork and guide you through the
bankruptcy process. For detailed information about the consumer
bankruptcy process, read Personal Bankruptcy Laws For Dummies
by James P. Caher and John M. Caher (Wiley).
Reestablishing Utility Service
If your utility service is terminated, you must pay the portion of
your bill that is past due, as well as all late fees and a reconnection
fee, to get your service back. You may also have to pay a deposit. If
you don’t have the money to pay everything and can’t or don’t
want to borrow what you need from a friend or relative, look for
help from one of the resources listed in the “Asking for help” sec-
tion earlier in this chapter.
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
194

If you believe that your service has been wrongfully terminated —
maybe you think that the utility did not follow all the rules leading
up to the termination — file an appeal with the PUC. If you win, the
utility may waive the reconnection fee and deposit requirements,
adjust the amount that it says is past due, work out a payment plan
so you can pay what you owe, and so on. For more information
about how the appeals process works, see the section of this 
chapter called “Appealing to your state PUC.”
Depending on where you live, your utility may be prohibited from
terminating your heat during the coldest months of the year or
from cutting off your air conditioning during the summer to avoid
endangering the health of anyone in your household. Also, termi-
nations are usually limited or prohibited if someone in your home
is seriously ill or relies on life-support equipment. In addition, most
utilities must jump through extra hoops before they can terminate
service if an elderly person, infant, or young child lives with you.

Chapter 13
Handling Medical Bills and
Child Support Obligations
In This Chapter
 Realizing the importance of paying
 Reviewing your medical bills for errors
 Figuring out how to make payments
W
e address two particularly difficult types of debts in this
chapter: medical debt and past-due court ordered child
support. They are difficult not only because of the potential legal
and financial consequences of not paying them, but also because
they can create more emotional stress and upheaval in your life
than most other debts. Not paying these debts can have serious
negative consequences on the people you care about, like a sick
child or spouse who needs ongoing care, or the children from your
previous marriage or from an unmarried relationship.
If you’re struggling to pay these debts, you won’t find easy answers
in this chapter. However, you will find a discussion of your options,
as well as an overview of what happens if you don’t pay them and
advice for avoiding legal trouble.
Appreciating the Risks of Not
Paying Your Medical Bills
Even if you have health insurance, a brief stay in the hospital or an
illness or accident that requires outpatient tests and extended
treatment can leave you with a mountain of medical debt to pay. If
you have no health coverage, your medical bills can easily exceed
what you can ever afford to pay. In fact, medical debt has become
one of the leading causes of consumer bankruptcy.

Making matters worse, a growing number of doctors and hospitals
are responding to their own economic pressures by getting tough
on patients who don’t (or can’t) pay their medical bills. You may
find that a doctor or hospital is willing to be quite aggressive about
collecting from you. The medical provider may
 Turn your past-due account over to a debt collector. Some
debt collectors blatantly flaunt the requirements of the fed-
eral Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). See Chapter 9
for details on this law and how to respond to a debt collec-
tor’s efforts.
If a medical provider turns your account over to a debt 
collector, that fact will almost certainly end up in your 
credit history. It will lower your credit score, even if the 
debt is relatively small.
 Sue you for the money you owe. By doing so, the medical
provider can get a court’s permission to put liens on your
property, freeze your bank accounts, seize your assets, and/or
garnish your wages (if you live in a state that allows wage 
garnishment).
 Refuse to treat you (or your family member). The provider
may take this step even if you (or your family member) have 
a serious and ongoing medical problem and even if you’re
paying off the debt through an installment plan. Some medical
providers require patients who owe them money to pay cash
up front in order to obtain additional medical care. These poli-
cies may not create insurmountable barriers to care if you live
in an urban area, but they create real problems for people in
rural areas where there are few (if any) alternative providers.
Taking Action to Reduce 
Your Medical Debt
If you’ve got high medical bills and you’re worried about how to
pay them, first try to reduce the amount of the bills as much as
possible:
 Be sure that the bills are accurate. When you find errors, get
them corrected and get your bills adjusted.
Don’t assume that medical billing errors don’t matter if you
have health insurance. They do. These errors can mean
higher co-pays and out-of-pocket costs for you and maybe
even higher premiums when your policy is renewed.
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
198

 Make your insurance company pay for everything it should.
If your bills are the result of an accident that someone else
caused, get that person’s insurance company to pay as many
of the bills as possible.
 Pursue all medical discounts you may be eligible for.
 Take advantage of medical bill paying assistance if you’re
eligible. You may qualify for help if you have a low income or
no health insurance.
In the sections that follow, we detail each of these options.
Reviewing bills with a fine-tooth
comb
Too many people put doctors and hospitals on a pedestal. They
assume that medical bills are always accurate or are afraid to
speak up when they find errors. Get over it! Medical professionals
are human beings just like you and me, which means that they
sometimes make billing mistakes.
Usually, the mistakes are innocent — information gets keyed in
wrong, for example. But even innocent errors can be costly. And
some billing errors are deliberate. For example, a doctor may use
one code to describe the treatment he provided to you but use a
different code to charge more for his services. Or a doctor may
purposefully charge you for a procedure you never received, or bill
for more hours of operating time than were actually required.
Studies show that the incidence of hospital billing fraud is rising.
Protect yourself by reviewing every medical bill you receive line by
line. Look for overcharges, double billings, and charges for care
and services you didn’t get.
If you have health insurance, make certain that your medical
provider does not bill you for charges you are not responsible for.
For example, your medical provider may bill you for the difference
between the total amount of your bill and the amount that the
insurance paid on the bill even though you’re responsible only for
making a small co-payment. If this happens to you, fight it; contact
the medical provider’s billing office first, and get the insurance
company involved if necessary.
You may be thinking, “Review my medical bills!! Easy for you to
say, but have you ever tried to decipher one of those things?”
You’re right. Most medical bills are full of codes, numbers, and
Chapter 13: Handling Medical Bills and Child Support Obligations 199

abbreviations that mean nothing to you and me. So if you can’t
make heads or tails of your bill, call the medical provider’s billing
office. Start asking questions, and don’t be afraid to ask more ques-
tions if you don’t understand an explanation or if something doesn’t
seem quite right. Politely but firmly let the person you speak with
know that you’re not going to pay your bill until you understand
exactly what you’re being charged for. The bigger the bill, the more
important it is for you to conduct a thorough audit.
For help figuring out your medical bills, order the medical billing
workbook published by Medical Billing Advocates of America
(MBAA). You can purchase the workbook for $22.95 at the organi-
zation’s Web site, www.billadvocates.com.
Making your health plan pay 
what it should
If you have health coverage and your health plan refuses to pay
one of your medical claims or does not pay as much as you think it
should, read your policy to see if you can find a reason for the
company’s decision. There may be a good explanation. But if there
isn’t, contact your plan’s customer service office and ask for one.
If you’re not satisfied with what you find out, get help resolving
your claim issue from your insurance agent or broker or from your
employer’s plan administrator if you receive health coverage
through your job. If these people can’t help you, send a letter to
the insurance company after calling to get the name and title of the
person to whom you should write. Be as specific as possible in
your letter about why you think your claim should be paid or why
you think more of the claim should be paid.
Your next avenue of recourse if your letter doesn’t get results is to
appeal your plan’s decision. The appeals process should be
spelled out in your policy or plan booklet. At the same time, you
may also want to file a complaint against the insurance company
with your state’s insurance department. (It may be called an insur-
ance commission in your state.) The department may have a com-
plaint resolution process for resolving problems between
consumers and their health plans.
If you let your insurance company know in writing that you have
filed a formal complaint against it with the insurance department
in your state, the insurer may decide to rethink how it handled
your claim. Insurance companies don’t want problems with state
insurance departments.
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
200

Finally, if the amount of money at issue is substantial, you may
want to hire a consumer law attorney to help you collect on a
claim. A letter from the attorney may be all it takes to convince the
insurance company to reverse its decision. Or you may have to file
a lawsuit to get results. If the attorney feels that you have a strong
case, she will probably agree to represent you on a contingent fee
basis: You won’t pay the attorney an upfront fee, but if you win
your lawsuit and collect any money that the court awards you as a
result, your attorney takes a percentage of what’s collected.
Exactly how much your attorney takes and all the other terms of
your financial arrangement should be put in writing.
Taking advantage of discounts 
when you’re hospitalized
Pursue all rate reductions you may be entitled to when you or
someone else in your family is hospitalized. For example,
 If your income is very low and you own few if any assets of
value, you may qualify for the hospital’s charity program. To
be eligible, you may have to prove that you applied for and
were denied Medicaid coverage. Medicaid is a federal/state
program for people with limited incomes. Individual states
administer the program and set their own eligibility rules,
although the federal government sets broad eligibility guide-
lines. For more information about the Medicaid program and
about your state’s particular eligibility rules, go to www.cms.
hhs.gov/medicaid/whoiseligible.asp.
 Some states require hospitals to offer discounts to any unin-
sured patient regardless of the patient’s income. However,
hospitals may offer this discount only if you ask for it, so
speak up if you don’t have health insurance. Then make sure
that the discount is reflected on your hospital bill.
 If your state does not require hospitals to offer discounts to
uninsured patients and you have no insurance, ask the hospi-
tal to charge you the same prices it charges insurance compa-
nies. Insurance companies are billed for services at a much
lower rate — as much as 60 percent lower — than what unin-
sured patients are charged. If the first person you talk to in the
hospital’s billing office says “no,” ask to speak to his manager.
Remind the hospital that charging you the same rates it
charges insurance companies makes it easier for you to pay
your hospital bill and less likely that you’ll have to file for
bankruptcy. If you file for bankruptcy, the hospital will receive
little or nothing on the bill.
Chapter 13: Handling Medical Bills and Child Support Obligations 201

If you don’t ask for a discount before you are billed by a hospital,
ask for it later and request an adjusted bill.
Pursuing other options for 
reducing your debt
Depending on your income and the total value of your assets, you
may have other options for reducing the amount you owe to med-
ical providers. For example,
 If your medical bills are the result of an auto accident that was
not your fault, make sure that the insurance company of the
other driver pays as much as possible on the bills.
 Contact churches and social service organizations in your
area to find out if any of them can help you with your medical
bills.
 Apply for Medicaid. In most states, after you are enrolled in
the program, Medicaid not only helps you pay future medical
bills but also pays bills that are as old as three months,
assuming they are for Medicaid-covered services. For informa-
tion about your state’s Medicaid program, go to www.cms.
hhs.gov/medicaid/stateplans.
Some hospitals let you whittle down your debt by doing volunteer
work. If this option interests you, speak to a hospital financial
counselor.
Tackling Your Remaining Debt
When you know exactly how much you owe on your medical bills,
you have a few options for paying the debt (assuming you don’t
have the cash to pay it in full):
 Ask the medical provider to set up an installment plan. Most
providers will let you pay this way, assuming you don’t owe so
much that it will take years before your debt is paid.
Before you ask a doctor or a hospital for a payment plan,
review your monthly household budget (see Chapter 4) so
you know how much you can afford to pay each month. Don’t
pay more. For a more detailed discussion of installment plans,
including negotiating tips, see Chapter 6.
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
202

Get clear about the terms and conditions of the installment
plan before you agree to it. For example,
• Will you be charged interest? If so, what will the interest
rate be?
• Are there any fees associated with the agreement?
• When will you be considered in default of the agreement,
and what will happen if you are?
Some doctors and hospitals will not provide additional care to
patients who have outstanding debt, sometimes even when
they’re paying off that debt through an installment plan.
 Pay your medical bills with a credit card. This option may
work if you have a relatively low interest, fixed-rate credit
card with enough available credit. You must make sure that
you can afford the monthly card payments.
Some hospitals encourage uninsured patients or patients with
high deductible policies who can’t afford to pay the full
amount of their bills to apply for a medical credit card.
However, the cards are usually not good deals given their
interest rates — as high as 23 percent. You’re probably better
off negotiating a payment plan because you may not have to
pay any interest on your medical debt and, if you do, the
interest rate will probably be lower than the rate associated
with the medical credit card.
 Get a bank loan. Obviously, you need to find out if you qualify
for one, and you must feel comfortable with the terms.
If you owe a lot of money to a healthcare provider and you own a
home, the provider may try to pressure you into paying the debt
by tapping the equity in the home or refinancing your mortgage
and getting cash out. Bad ideas! Sure, you get the healthcare
provider off your back, but your home will be at risk if you can’t
keep up with the loan payments.
Your final option, if none of the others works, may be to file for
bankruptcy. If a medical provider is threatening to take legal action
against you, filing for bankruptcy is probably your best move.
Depending on your overall financial situation, you may be able to
get rid of the debt completely by filing a Chapter 7 liquidation
bankruptcy.
If you don’t qualify for Chapter 7, you can use a Chapter 13 reor-
ganization to reduce what you owe on some of your debts. You can
also get up to five years to pay off most of your remaining debts,
Chapter 13: Handling Medical Bills and Child Support Obligations 203

including medical debts, through monthly installments. For more
information about bankruptcy and medical debts, pick up a copy
of Personal Bankruptcy Laws For Dummies by James P. Caher and
John M. Caher (Wiley).
Before you file for bankruptcy, schedule an appointment with a
nonprofit credit counseling agency (see Chapter 8). The agency
may be able to help you figure out a way to handle your medical
bills some other way.
Prioritizing Paying Child Support
Child support is most often an issue when you are divorced and
have minor children (which means under age 18 in most states)
from your former marriage. Depending on the terms of your
divorce agreement, a court order may be in place requiring you to
pay your ex-spouse a sum of money each month for a set amount
of time. The court order may also require that you provide your
kids with health insurance, help pay for their college educations,
and so on.
If you have minor children from a non-married relationship, you
can also owe child support if the other parent obtains a child sup-
port court order.
Assuming the child support court order was written (or modified)
after December 31, 1993, and assuming you are employed, your
child support payments are automatically deducted from your
wages. However, if you and the other parent decided not to have
the payments automatically deducted, if you are self-employed, or
if you are unemployed, you are legally obligated to make your own
child support payments regardless of the state of your finances.
Even if you’re going through tough financial times, you have a
moral (as well as a legal) obligation to help take care of your kids
by paying your court ordered child support each month. Making
those payments should be one your top priorities. Your kids
should not have to pay the price for your money problems, nor
should their other parent have to sacrifice or work harder to make
up for the child support you don’t pay.
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
204

Knowing the Consequences 
of Not Paying
You face serious consequences if you don’t keep up with your child
support obligation and the other parent takes steps to get the child
support court order enforced. Here are some possibilities:
 The state that ordered you to pay child support will come
after you for the money.
 A child support debt collection agency may try to collect 
from you.
 The other parent may hire an attorney to collect from you.
 A family law judge may put you in jail until you pay your past-
due child support.
Starting a new family has no effect on your financial obligations to
the minor children you already have. You must continue providing
them with support according to the terms of the child support
court order. The court will not modify the court order just because
you have more kids.
If you fall behind in your child support obligation, eventually, a gov-
ernment office, a private collection agency, or an attorney may con-
tact you. (When and if you are contacted about your past-due child
support largely depends on how aggressive the other parent of
your children is about collecting the money you owe.) In the follow-
ing sections, we explain what you may be up against in each case.
Getting the government involved
Every state has a Child Support Enforcement program (CSE),
which is funded in part by the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services (HHS). The CSE office has a variety of tools at its
disposal for collecting past-due child support from a parent,
although the exact tools vary from state to state.
If you fall behind on your child support payments and your child’s
other parent contacts the CSE office in the state where your court
order was issued, the office will contact you about the money you
owe and ask you to pay it.
Chapter 13: Handling Medical Bills and Child Support Obligations 205

Assuming you can’t afford to pay the money in a lump sum, the
office may agree to let you get caught up through an installment
payment plan. It may put a lien on one or more of your assets to
guarantee that you live up to the terms of the plan. If you renege, it
may take the assets, sell them, and apply the proceeds to your
child support debt.
When you and the CSE office agree on a payment plan, get the
agreement in writing, including all terms and conditions. If the
office refuses to okay an installment plan that you can afford, you
can file an appeal.
If you ignore the CSE’s efforts to contact you about your child sup-
port debt, or if you can’t reach an agreement with one another
about how you will get caught up on your payments, the CSE may
do one or more of the following to collect what you owe. (Exactly
what the office does and how quickly it acts vary from state to
state and also depend on how long your debt goes unpaid and how
much past-due child support you owe.) The CSE may
 Put liens on some of your nonexempt assets so you can’t
borrow against them, transfer them into someone else’s name,
or sell them without first paying your child support debt.
 Take some of your nonexempt assets and sell them in order to
pay off your past-due child support debt. However, the CSE
office won’t take your home or the assets you need to earn a
living.
 Put a lien on your bank and/or investment account or levy the
funds in those accounts. (Levy is legal talk for seizing the funds.)
 Suspend or cancel your driver’s license and/or your profes-
sional license, such as a license to practice law or medicine. It
may also suspend your hunting or fishing license.
 Deny or suspend your passport.
 Try to embarrass you by posting your photo and information
about your child support debt on the Internet or on “wanted”
posters.
 Intercept money you may be awarded by an insurance com-
pany in the settlement of a claim, including a personal injury
or Worker’s Compensation claim.
 Intercept any money you may win in a lottery.
 Intercept your state and/or federal income tax refund.
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
206

 Ask the IRS to collect the money you owe. If the IRS gets in
touch about your child support debt and you can’t afford to
pay it in full, the agency may agree to let you pay in install-
ments. If you don’t cooperate with the IRS or if you violate the
terms of your agreement with the agency, it may take your tax
refunds and/or seize some of your assets, sell them, and apply
the proceeds to your child support debt.
 Take you to court. Remember: You may even be jailed for
past-due child support!
If you owe at least $1,000 in past-due child support, HHS requires
that the debt be reported to the three national credit reporting
agencies so that creditors, employers, landlords, insurance compa-
nies, and anyone else who looks at the reports will see that you
have fallen behind on your obligation to your children. Obviously,
that information reflects badly on you.
Being pursued by a child support
collection agency
Instead of dealing with the government, your children’s other
parent may hire a private child support collection agency to collect
the money you owe. She may do that because she wants quicker
action than her state’s CSE office can provide or because the CSE
has been trying to collect from you but has not yet succeeded.
Although private debt collection agencies don’t have at their dis-
posal all the collection tools that state CSE offices can use, they are
frequently able to get faster results than the government because
they don’t have as much bureaucratic red tape to deal with. Also,
they juggle fewer cases than CSE offices handle, and they are
better staffed. Bottom line: They have more time and resources to
focus on collecting the child support you owe. Also, they are moti-
vated by money to keep pursuing you because they get paid by
taking a substantial portion of the money they collect.
Initially, most private child support collection agencies will contact
you directly to discuss how you intend to get caught up on what
you owe. If you cannot pay your debt in full, the agency that con-
tacts you tries to get you to agree to an installment payment plan.
If you can’t afford one or you aren’t able to agree on the terms of a
plan, the agency may ask the court for permission to do one or
more of the following:
Chapter 13: Handling Medical Bills and Child Support Obligations 207

 Have your wages garnished, if wage garnishment is legal in
your state.
 Place liens on some of your assets.
 Enforce a lien that may already be in place as part of your
divorce agreement.
 Freeze assets, such as the money in your retirement plan, any
settlements you have received from a lawsuit or from an
insurance company, or an inheritance. When these assets are
frozen, you cannot sell, borrow against, or transfer them with-
out clearing up your child support debt first.
The federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) does not
regulate private child support collection agencies. However, some
states have passed laws to govern what these agencies can and
can’t do. To date, those states are Arkansas, Connecticut, Illinois,
Louisiana, Maine, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Washington, and West
Virginia.
If you are contacted by a child support debt collection agency and
you cannot afford to pay your debt in a lump sum or through an
installment plan, discuss your options with a bankruptcy attorney.
The attorney may be able to help you figure out what to do about
your debt so you can avoid having to file bankruptcy.
Hearing from an attorney
Another way that the other parent of your minor children may try
to collect the past-due child support you owe is by hiring a family
law attorney. For example, your former spouse may get in touch
with the attorney who represented her in your divorce.
The attorney can take all the same steps that a private debt collec-
tion agency can to collect what you owe. These steps include put-
ting a lien on one or more of your assets, enforcing an existing lien,
taking a portion of your wages up to the amount of your debt, seiz-
ing some of your assets, and freezing some of your assets.
If you hear from an attorney about your past-due child support
obligation, get in touch with a family law or bankruptcy attorney
right away.

Keeping Up with Your Obligation
When money is tight and you wonder if you can keep up with your
child support payments, you must do everything you can to make
them. Your kids’ quality of life is at stake, and you may face serious
consequences if you fall behind (as we explain in the previous 
section).
Making tough choices
To avoid missing child support payments, here are some steps you
can take:
 Review your budget for each and every spending reduction
you can possibly make. If you don’t have a budget, it’s time to
prepare one (see Chapter 4).
 Consider getting another job or doing freelance work. Use the
additional income to help pay your child support.
 Contact your creditors about lowering your monthly pay-
ments. In Chapter 6, we tell you how to negotiate.
 Consolidate your debts to reduce the amount you have to pay
to your creditors each month. We detail the ins and outs of
debt consolidation in Chapter 7.
 If you believe your financial problems are temporary, borrow
the money you need to keep up with your child support pay-
ments (or catch up on payments you’ve already missed).
 If you believe your financial problems are temporary, use
credit card convenience checks to handle your child support
obligation in the short term. Although you’ll be charged a high
rate of interest on the money you borrow, the cost may be
worth it if you can avoid falling behind on your payments.
 Sell assets. Are you driving a nice car? Do you have a boat or 
a motorcycle? What about that rare coin collection you own?
Sell what you can, and use the sale money to take care of 
your kids.
If you can’t keep up with your child support payments and
your mortgage or rent payments too, you may even need to
consider selling your home. You can buy a less expensive
place to live or find a place to rent.
Chapter 13: Handling Medical Bills and Child Support Obligations 209

 Ask the court that issued the child support court order to
modify the order on a temporary or permanent basis. If the
court agrees, you are still responsible for paying any child
support you may have already missed. We explain how modifi-
cations work in the next section.
 File for bankruptcy. You can’t use bankruptcy to wipe out
past-due child support, but you can use it to get rid of other
debt, which may make it easier for you to keep up with your
child support obligation in the future. Also, if you file for
Chapter 13 bankruptcy, you can have up to five years to pay
off the full amount of the child support that is past due.
However, you must make each of your current child support
payments on time while you are in bankruptcy.
The longer you delay paying your past-due child support, the
harder it will be for you to get caught up, and the bigger the poten-
tial consequences of falling behind.
Asking the court for a modification
You can ask the court to lower how much you have to pay in child
support each month if your financial circumstances have changed
substantially since the court order was written. For example,
 You lost your job and have not found a new one.
 After months of looking, you’ve landed a new job, but it pays
far less than what you used to earn.
 You’re unable to work because of a serious illness or accident.
Depending on your situation, the court may agree to modify the
court order on a temporary or permanent basis. But the court
won’t agree to a modification unless it is satisfied that you have
exhausted all options for keeping up with your current obligation.
If the judge agrees to a temporary modification, the court will
determine how long the modification will last and how much you
must pay while the modification is in effect. The judge may require
you to make up the difference between what you would have been
paying and what you actually paid during the period of lower pay-
ments by increasing the amount of your child support payments
for a while after the modification period ends. Alternatively, the
judge may require you to make up the difference by giving your
children’s other parent an asset that you own that is approximately
equal in value to the amount of money she won’t be receiving
during the modification period.
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
210

It’s best to work with a family law attorney if you want your child
support obligation to be modified. The attorney assesses your situ-
ation and lets you know whether you have a good shot at a modifi-
cation. If you decide to file a request for a modification, the
attorney represents you at the hearing.
Filing a request for a modification does not change your obligation to
pay child support according to the original court order. Therefore,
while you are waiting for the modification hearing to take place, con-
tinue making your payments. If you can’t pay the full amount of the
payments, pay as much as you can. Courts don’t look kindly upon
deadbeat parents! Also, any child support you don’t pay can be col-
lected from you. In fact, the judge may require that you pay what you
owe by a certain date as a condition of a modification.
You increase your chances of getting a modification if your kids’
other parent agrees to your request for the change. Even better is
if the two of you can work out all the terms and conditions of the
modification before your court hearing.

Chapter 14
Catching Up on Your 
Federal Taxes
In This Chapter
 Filing your return and paying by April 15
 Knowing your options if you can’t pay on time
 Facing the consequences of getting behind
O
wing past-due taxes to Uncle Sam is serious business. No
creditor has greater power than the IRS to collect from you,
and the agency can be relentless and ruthless in pursuit of its
money. Furthermore, while your taxes are outstanding, the IRS
charges you interest and penalties. As a result, if you drag your
feet long enough, you may end up owing more in interest and
penalties than you owe in taxes!
In this chapter, we explain how to avoid paying interest and penal-
ties to the IRS by meeting your federal tax obligations on April 15.
We then give you the rundown on your options for paying your
taxes after they are due, including setting up an installment pay-
ment plan with the IRS and asking the agency to let you settle your
debt for less. And we explain how bankruptcy can help you deal
with your unpaid taxes.
We also clue you in on the consequences of ignoring your federal
tax obligations. (Did you know the IRS can put a federal tax lien on
your assets, take some of your assets — maybe even your home —
and have your wages garnished?) Finally, we explain how the
appeals process works when you want to formally object to an IRS
decision.

Respecting the Sanctity 
of April 15
April 15 is drawing near, and you’re in a panic. You owe income
taxes to Uncle Sam, but you don’t have enough money in your
bank account to pay them. What to do, what to do? Here’s what not
to do: Don’t bury your head in the sand! It’ll cost you, big time!
At the very least, file your tax return on time, or file IRS Form 4868,
“Application for Automatic Extension to File,” which gives you until
August 15 to get your return to the IRS. You can download the
extension request form at www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f4868.
pdf, order it by calling 800-829-3767, or pick it up at your local IRS
office.
An extension to file your tax return is not an extension to pay your
taxes. Taxes are due on April 15, come hell or high water, and the
IRS begins charging interest and penalties on your unpaid taxes on
April 16 (as we explain in the next section). For this reason, paying
some of your taxes on April 15 is better than paying nothing at all.
The more you pay, the less your tax debt will grow because of
interest and penalties.
If you don’t have enough money in your bank account to pay all
the taxes you owe by April 15, consider using one of the following
options to get them paid. As we point out in this list, each option
can be costly. It’s a good idea to consult with a CPA or financial
advisor about whether any of these options is right for you. That
person may suggest that you will be better off asking the IRS to let
you pay what you owe in installments or to let you settle your debt
for less through an Offer in Compromise. We discuss both of these
payment options later in this chapter.
 Pay with plastic. You have to pay a fee of about 2.5 percent on
the amount that you charge to the IRS. And, of course, if you
don’t pay the full amount of your tax debt when you receive
your account statement, you pay interest to the credit card
company.
Don’t assume that you can pay your taxes with a credit card,
declare bankruptcy, and make the debt disappear. If you file
for bankruptcy before you’ve paid off your tax-related credit
card debt, the bankruptcy court treats the debt exactly the
same way it would treat your taxes if they were still outstand-
ing. In other words, if the taxes would be dischargeable in
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
214

bankruptcy, you’ll be able to use bankruptcy to get the credit
card debt discharged. However, if the taxes cannot be dis-
charged in bankruptcy, you cannot use bankruptcy to get rid
of the credit card debt either.
 Use a credit card convenience check. This option is rela-
tively expensive because you probably have to pay a fee to
the credit card company for the privilege of using the conven-
ience check. Plus, if you can’t pay off the amount of the check
right away, interest accrues.
 Borrow against your home equity. The good news is that the
interest you pay on the borrowed money is probably tax
deductible. The bad news is that if you can’t repay the bor-
rowed money, you may lose your home.
Facing the Music on April 16
If you don’t pay the full amount of your income taxes on April 15,
you can expect your tax bill to increase, and you can expect to
hear from the IRS.
Tallying penalties and interest
On April 16, the IRS begins charging you penalties and interest on
your unpaid taxes:
 Penalties: For every month or part of a month that you have
an outstanding income tax debt, you’re charged a penalty 
that equals 5 percent of what you owe (including accrued
interest and penalties), with a maximum penalty of 25 percent.
If 60 days pass and you’ve still not filed your tax return, the
minimum penalty becomes $100 or the full amount of money
that you still owe to the IRS — whichever is less.
 Interest: You’re charged interest, compounded daily, on your
outstanding tax debt (taxes plus accumulated interest and
penalties). The interest rate is the federal short-term rate,
which is set every three months, plus 3 percent.
The IRS may agree to reduce the amount of penalties you owe if
you have a good reason for needing a reduction. For example,
maybe there’s been a serious illness or death in your family; or
maybe a fire, flood, or earthquake destroyed your tax records.
Unfortunately, owing too much to your other creditors or misman-
aging your money does not warrant a reduction.
Chapter 14: Catching Up on Your Federal Taxes 215

Also, if you can prove to the IRS that it miscalculated the amount
of interest it says you owe or made some other error affecting the
amount of interest being charged, the IRS may agree to reduce the
amount of interest it says you owe so far. In reality, however, con-
vincing the IRS that it made a mistake is a very big challenge.
Being pressured to pay
In addition to penalizing you financially for a past-due tax bill, the
IRS starts asking you to pay up.
First, you receive a “Notice of Taxes Due and Demand for
Payment,” which is essentially an IRS bill for the taxes you owe
plus interest and penalties. If you disagree with the amount stated
on the bill, immediately call the phone number on the notice or
talk to someone at your local IRS office.
If you ignore the first notice, you receive a second notice asking for
payment. However, this notice comes with an IRS publication
explaining that the IRS may put a federal tax lien on all your assets
and/or levy on (seize) some of them in order to collect your tax
debt.
Next, an outside debt collector may get in touch to try to collect
your tax debt or to obtain information that the IRS can use to col-
lect what you owe, possibly by setting up an installment plan for
you. (The collector gets 25 percent of any money he collects.)
Figuring out how to pay
If you couldn’t pay your taxes on April 15, you probably can’t pay
them in full after that date either, especially since interest and
penalties increase the debt. If that’s the case, you probably have
only three ways to take care of the debt and prevent the IRS from
taking steps to collect the money from you:
 Set up an installment payment plan. Depending on how
much you owe in income taxes and the overall state of your
finances, an IRS payment plan may be the way to go. In the
next section, we explain how installment plans work.
 Make the IRS an Offer in Compromise (OIC). Under certain
circumstances, the IRS will let you settle your debt for less
than the full amount you owe. However, getting the IRS to con-
sider an OIC, much less accept it, can be an uphill battle. In
the upcoming section “Using an Offer in Compromise to cut a
deal with the IRS,” we clue you in on how OICs work.
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
216

 File for bankruptcy. If your finances are in dire shape and you
owe a bundle to the IRS, filing for bankruptcy may be your
best bet, especially if you file before the agency puts a federal
tax lien on your assets. However, filing won’t get rid of your
tax debt — it will be waiting for you to pay it when you com-
plete your bankruptcy — nor will it stop the collection efforts
of the IRS. Read the section “Filing bankruptcy to deal with
your tax debt” later in this chapter for more details.
Paying your taxes in installments
When you can’t afford to pay your income taxes in full, you may be
able to pay them through an IRS installment plan, which requires
you to make monthly payments. However, the IRS won’t give you
an installment plan if any of your tax returns for previous years
have not been filed.
The process for setting up an installment payment plan depends
on how much you owe to the IRS: less than $10,000; more than
$10,000 but less than $25,000; or more than $25,000. (The more
money you owe to the IRS, the more paperwork you have to fill
out.) But the first step, regardless of how much you owe, is to fill
out IRS Form 9465, “Installment Agreement Request.” To get this
form, go to www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f9465.pdf, call 800-829-
3767, or visit your local IRS office.
When you complete the form, you have to indicate the following:
 How much you want to pay on your tax debt each month:
The faster you pay off your tax debt, the less you end up
paying in interest and penalties. Best-case scenario, you can
afford to pay the debt before next year’s taxes are due.
However, don’t agree to pay more than you can afford. If you
fall behind on your payments, the IRS will cancel your install-
ment plan, and it may take steps to collect what you owe. See
Chapter 4 for help creating a monthly budget so you know
what a realistic payment would be.
 How each payment will be made: The easiest and safest way
to ensure that each payment will be made in full and on time
is to have payments automatically debited from your bank
account or for your employer to treat them as automatic pay-
roll deductions. However, you can tell the IRS that you will
make the payments yourself.
After you’ve filed your request for an installment plan, the IRS con-
tacts you within 30 days to let you know if your request has been
approved or rejected. The agency may tell you that it needs more
information before it can make a decision. If your plan is approved,
Chapter 14: Catching Up on Your Federal Taxes 217

you pay a $43 plan setup fee, which the IRS takes out of your first
payment.
If the IRS okays your installment plan, it expects you to comply
with two specific terms and conditions. You must
 Make each installment payment in full and on time. Here’s
an excellent reason to be realistic about how much you can
afford to pay to the IRS each month.
 Pay your income taxes and file your tax returns on time
while your plan is in effect. In lieu of filing a return, you may
file an application for an extension to file, as long as you do so
by April 15.
If you don’t comply with these conditions, the IRS considers you in
default, which means it may cancel the plan and try to collect the
money you owe. In other words, you could find yourself facing the
very consequences you hoped to avoid by setting up an install-
ment plan in the first place.
Paying off less than $10,000
When you owe the IRS less than $10,000, the agency automatically
greenlights your installment plan request, assuming the following
are true:
 The IRS is satisfied that you cannot pay what you owe in a
lump sum.
 You (or you and your spouse, if you file jointly) filed each of
your tax returns on time over the previous five years or filed
extension requests on time.
 You paid any taxes due on time during the previous five years.
 The amount of your monthly payments is high enough to get
your income tax debt (including all interest and penalties)
paid in full within three years.
Paying off more than $10,000 but less than $25,000
If you owe this much, approval of your installment plan won’t be
automatic. However, the IRS will probably agree to an installment
plan, assuming your monthly payments are large enough to wipe
out your income tax debt within five years.
If you can’t afford to pay your tax debt within five years through an
installment plan, you can ask the IRS to allow you to take longer.
However, to get the agency’s permission to do that, you have to fill
out Form 433-A, “Collection Information Statement.” We talk about
this form in the next section.
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
218

Paying off more than $25,000 in taxes
When you owe the IRS more than $25,000 in taxes and you want to
pay that debt in installments, you must complete two forms: IRS
Form 9465 and IRS Form 433-A, “Collection Information Statement.”
You may also have to provide the IRS other information about your
finances.
The “Collection Information Statement” asks for a lot of detailed
information about your finances. Among other things, you have to
provide information about your assets, monthly expenses, and
sources of monthly income. Filling out the form is time consuming.
When you fill out the “Collection Information Statement,” you 
tell the IRS exactly what it needs to know if it decides later to 
try to collect your tax debt, maybe because you default on your
installment payment plan. Sure, the IRS can find out the informa-
tion on its own, but that process takes time. So by completing the
“Collection Information Statement,” you make it a whole lot easier
for the IRS to collect from you. However, you have no choice if you
need to pay your tax debt in installments.
The IRS uses the information on the “Collection Information State-
ment” to figure out how much you can afford to pay on your tax
debt each month. To help it make this calculation, the IRS com-
pares your total monthly income from all sources to your total
monthly living expenses.
When the IRS adds up your expenses to get a monthly total, it
includes only those expenses it considers to be essential, and its
definition of essential expenses may be quite different from yours.
For example, its total won’t include the monthly cost of your cable
television or your gym membership. Also, it won’t include the
monthly payments you may be making on your credit card debts
or on other unsecured debts. In other words, the IRS may end up
with a monthly expense total that vastly understates what it really
costs you to live. (You may be able to get the IRS to change its
mind about an expense it considers nonessential if you can prove
that the expense is essential to your ability to earn a living.)
Wait, it gets worse! When it comes to expenses that the IRS does
consider to be essential, like food and clothing, it may not recog-
nize the total amount that you’re spending every month. Here’s
why: The IRS uses standard monthly guideline amounts to budget
for essential expenses, which may be less than what you actually
spend. For example, if you spend $400 per month on food but the
agency’s guidelines say you should be spending only $350, the IRS
uses $350 when it calculates what you can afford to pay on your
income tax debt each month.
Chapter 14: Catching Up on Your Federal Taxes 219

In other words, the IRS may conclude that you can afford to pay
more each month on your tax debt than you feel is realistic. Unless
you can do some drastic budget cutting, paying off your debt
through an installment plan is wishful thinking. What are your
options? Get the IRS to accept an Offer in Compromise, or file for
bankruptcy. (We discuss each of these in upcoming sections.) Or
try to get the IRS to change its mind about what you can afford to
pay each month. Doing so probably requires that you formally
appeal the agency’s decision. For an overview of how the appeals
process works, read the sidebar “Appealing an IRS decision.”
If your knees shake and your mouth gets dry when you think 
about negotiating with the IRS, ask someone else to do it for you.
That someone else can be an attorney, a CPA, or someone who 
has power of attorney to conduct your financial affairs. Your repre-
sentative completes IRS Form 2848, “Power of Attorney and
Declaration of Representative,” which can be downloaded at
www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f2848.pdf. If you want that person
to also have access to confidential information and documents
relating to your taxes and your finances — information that the IRS
would normally share only with you — your representative also
needs to complete IRS Form 8821, “Tax Information Authorization,”
which can be downloaded at www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8821.
pdf. Both forms can also be obtained by calling 800-829-3767 or by
visiting a local IRS office.
Using an Offer in Compromise to cut a deal with the IRS
If your finances are in such dire shape that you cannot afford to pay
the full amount of your income tax debt in installments or any other
way, the IRS may agree to let you settle the debt for less — maybe
for pennies on the dollar — through an Offer in Compromise (OIC).
However, OICs are hard to get, and you won’t be eligible for one
unless all your tax returns for the previous five years have been
filed and you’re not already in bankruptcy.
Settling your debt for less with the IRS can be tricky business.
Although you can try doing it yourself, you increase the odds of
success by hiring a pro like a CPA or a tax attorney with experience
negotiating OICs.
Beware of companies that advertise on the Internet offering to help
you prepare your OIC (for a fee, of course). Many of them have
little or no expertise with OICs and, therefore, little chance of get-
ting the IRS to accept yours.
You initiate the OIC process by completing IRS Form 656, “Offer in
Compromise,” which is actually a package of forms and worksheets,
including a “Collection Information Statement for Individuals.” You
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
220

must also pay the IRS a $150 OIC application fee, although you can
get the fee waived under certain conditions. Don’t pay the applica-
tion fee until you know whether you qualify for a waiver.
In addition, you must make a nonrefundable, partial payment on
your OIC when you submit your request. The amount of the pay-
ment depends on how much you are asking to settle your debt for
and the terms of your offer, such as how long you want to take to
pay it. Usually, the more time you want, the bigger your offer must
be. For example, if you agree to pay your settlement amount in one
lump sum, the IRS will probably agree to take less money from you
than if you want to pay the settlement amount in installments over
a year or more.
After you file all the appropriate IRS forms and pay the application
fee and the nonrefundable, partial payment on your OIC, the IRS
agrees to formally consider your offer if it concludes that one of
the following conditions applies to you:
 You will probably never be able to pay the full amount you
owe to the IRS, and it will probably never collect the money
from you — maybe because you have no assets of value and
you make very little money relative to the amount of your tax
debt.
 The amount of taxes that the IRS says you owe is incorrect.
You probably have to make this case to the IRS. The agency is
unlikely to make it for you.
 Your tax debt shouldn’t be collected because of an economic
hardship or some other special circumstances that you face.
If the IRS decides that one of these conditions applies to you, it
evaluates your OIC by using the information on your “Collection
Information Statement” form. Meanwhile, the agency halts any
actions it may already be taking to collect from you, which means
no more calls from debt collectors, no more wage garnishment,
and no asset seizures. (If the IRS rejects your OIC, its collection
efforts can immediately resume.)
While the IRS is reviewing your OIC, the ten-year statute of limita-
tions on collecting your tax debt is suspended. After it makes its
decision, the statute of limitations begins running again. If you’re
unhappy with the agency’s decision regarding your OIC and you
file an appeal, the statute of limitations is suspended again while
your appeal is being considered. The effect of having the statute of
limitations suspended is that the period of time during which the
IRS can try to collect from you gets pushed farther into the future.
Chapter 14: Catching Up on Your Federal Taxes 221

Getting the green light
If the IRS gives your OIC request the go-ahead, and if you agreed to
pay the amount in a lump sum, you must make the payment within
90 days. If you agreed to a short-term deferred payment plan, you
have up to 24 months to pay what you owe. And if you set up a
longer-term plan, you have to pay the settlement amount in equal
payments over the period that remains on the statute of limitations
for collecting your tax debt.
When you pay the settlement amount in installments, regardless of
the term of your payment plan, you must make each payment on
time, and you must file your tax returns on time and pay any taxes
you owe on time while your plan is in effect. If you don’t, you will
be in default of your agreement with the IRS, and the agency may
take action to collect what you still owe to it.
Being rejected
You’re notified in writing if the IRS rejects your OIC. The notice you
receive explains why your offer was rejected. Most OICs get
rejected because the IRS thinks that the amount of the settlement
offer is too small. In other words, the IRS believes it can reasonably
expect to collect more from you given the value of your real and
personal assets and the amount of your future income.
If the IRS rejects your offer for this reason, it tells you what it con-
siders to be an acceptable settlement amount given your finances.
If you don’t understand the explanation or disagree with the
agency’s decision, call the number on the IRS notice.
You can submit a new offer to the IRS if it rejects your first one. If
you are working with a CPA or attorney, she may call the IRS rev-
enue officer (also called a field officer) assigned to your case to dis-
cuss what kind of offer the IRS would find acceptable. If you’re
handling your own OIC, you can make the same call.
You can also appeal the agency’s decision about your OIC. The
notice explains how to file an appeal. The sidebar “Appealing an
IRS decision” in this chapter summarizes the appeals process.
Filing bankruptcy to deal with your tax debt
Filing for bankruptcy is a good way to deal with your tax debt
when your finances are in such bad shape that neither an install-
ment plan nor an OIC is a real option. It’s also a smart move if you
think that the IRS may be about to seize some of your assets or gar-
nish your wages. Exactly how bankruptcy affects your tax debt is a
complicated matter determined by a variety of criteria and consid-
erations, including how long you’ve owed the taxes and whether
the IRS has already put a federal tax lien on your assets.
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
222

If the IRS has not yet filed a tax lien, and assuming your tax debt is
more than three years old and that you filed your tax returns on
time during those three years (or filed for an extension), you can
do one of the following:
 File a Chapter 7 liquidation bankruptcy to get rid of your tax
debt.
 File a Chapter 13 reorganization bankruptcy to reduce the
total amount that you owe to the IRS and get three to five
years to pay your remaining tax debt, including interest and
penalties, in full.
If your income tax debt is less than three years old, you cannot use
Chapter 7 to get rid of the debt. Instead, you must file Chapter 13,
which gives you up to five years to pay the full amount of your
income tax debt, including all penalties. If the IRS has already filed
a tax lien, you must also pay interest on your outstanding tax debt.
If you file for bankruptcy after the IRS has filed a federal tax lien,
your tax debt becomes a secured debt. As a result,
 You can’t use Chapter 7 to wipe out the debt. Instead, you
have to pay the full amount after your bankruptcy is over.
However, paying it should be easier because you won’t owe as
much to other creditors.
 You won’t be able to reduce your tax debt through Chapter 13,
and you have to pay the full amount of the debt while you are
in bankruptcy (over a three- to five-year period). In addition,
while you are in bankruptcy, the bankruptcy court charges
you interest on your unpaid tax balance. The interest rate will
be a local rate.
So, what’s the lesson in all this? When you can’t afford to pay your
federal income taxes and you are thinking about bankruptcy, con-
sult with a consumer bankruptcy attorney immediately — before
the IRS puts a lien on your assets. For more information about 
federal income taxes and personal bankruptcy, get a copy of
Personal Bankruptcy Laws For Dummies by James P. Caher and 
John M. Caher (Wiley).
Liens and Levies: Collecting 
Past-Due Taxes
If you ignore your IRS tax debt, or if you and the IRS can’t come to
an agreement about an installment payment plan or an OIC, the
Chapter 14: Catching Up on Your Federal Taxes 223

agency may take steps to collect what you owe. Whether it does,
how quickly it does, and exactly what it does depend in large part
on the specific IRS revenue officer handling your case. Some rev-
enue officers are aggressive (a little like pit bulls), but others are
more likely to help you figure out a way to pay your tax debt so
you can avoid what comes next.
Besides the personality of the revenue officer, other factors help
determine whether the IRS tries to collect your debt. They include
 How much you owe. The more you owe, the more likely that
the IRS will try to collect its money.
 The amount of your income. The IRS may decide to garnish
your wages in order to collect what you owe.
Law prohibits the IRS from collecting from you if you can
prove that your income is less than your living expenses and
that, therefore, your tax debt is uncollectible. However, the
IRS determines your expenses according to its standard guide-
lines, which are very low. Proving that your tax debt is uncol-
lectible may be a losing battle, but a tax attorney or a CPA
with experience dealing with the IRS may be able to make
your case.
 Whether you have any assets that the IRS can take. If you do,
the IRS puts a federal tax lien on all of them. The lien also
applies to any assets you may acquire in the future. The next
section offers a quick lesson on federal tax liens.
After the liens are in place, the IRS may levy on, or take, some
of your assets. The levy may happen right away or not for
some time. Find out how levies work in the upcoming section
“Losing your assets because of a levy.”
If you earn next to nothing and all your assets are exempt from the
IRS, you’re safe — for now, anyway. (The agency will probably let
interest and penalties continue to accrue so your tax debt grows
larger by the day.) Periodically, the IRS reviews your financial situa-
tion to see if it’s improved. If it has, and assuming that the ten-
year statute of limitations for tax debt has not expired, the IRS will
collect as much as it can from you. The sidebar “What the IRS can’t
take from you” in this chapter offers an overview of the assets that
are safe from the clutches of the agency.
Knowing how tax liens work
Before the IRS can put a lien on your assets, it must send you a
“Notice and Demand for Payment.” If you don’t pay the full amount
of your tax debt within ten days of the notice date, the IRS puts a
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
224

federal tax lien on your assets, including those you have only an
interest in. The lien also applies to any assets you may acquire or
have an interest in some time later. The lien may even get attached
if you apply for an installment payment plan within the ten-day
period.
The IRS files the tax lien in your county courthouse, making it part
of the public record. Therefore, the lien shows up in your credit
history and harms your credit score. You cannot sell, borrow
against, or transfer any of the assets that the lien is attached to
without paying off the tax lien.
There are only a few ways to get a lien released. You can
 Pay the full amount you owe to the IRS in a lump sum, includ-
ing all penalties and interest.
 Pay your debt in full through an installment payment plan.
Some IRS agents release a tax lien after your installment plan
has been set up.
 Settle your debt for less through an Offer in Compromise.
 Wait for the ten-year statute of limitations on your tax debt to
run out. However, the IRS is likely to refile the lien before the
ten years are up.
Chapter 14: Catching Up on Your Federal Taxes 225
What the IRS can’t take from you
The IRS has the power to take just about any asset of yours that it can get its hands
on in order to collect the taxes you owe. However, there are a few exceptions. These
exempt assets are specific to the IRS. In other words, they are not the same as the
assets that you can keep when you file for bankruptcy.
The IRS must keep its mitts off the following:
 Your fuel, food, furniture, and personal items, up to a certain amount
 The books and tools you need to earn a living, up to a certain amount
 Unemployment payments
 Worker’s compensation payments
 Certain types of public assistance payments
 Service-related disability payments
 Certain annuity and pension benefits
 Court ordered child support payments

Appealing an IRS decision
You can appeal most IRS decisions related to your outstanding tax debt by using
one of two processes: the Collection Appeals Program (CAP) or the Collection Due
Process (CDP).
When you appeal a collection action that the IRS may be about to take, the IRS must
suspend the action while your appeal is being considered. (Your appeal has no
effect on the accrual of interest and penalties on your unpaid taxes.) If the agency
rules against you, the IRS can resume whatever it was doing.
 The Collection Appeals Program (CAP): You can use this process to try to clear
up a dispute related to a lien before or after it has been filed, a pending levy, the
seizure of one of your assets, or the denial or termination of an installment pay-
ment plan. The good news is that the CAP is relatively fast. The bad news is that
if you’re unhappy with the outcome of your appeal, you can’t take the IRS to
court.
Here’s how the process works: If you are notified of an IRS decision related to
an issue covered by the CAP, contact an IRS collections staff person to let him
know that you are disputing the agency’s action. (The number to call should be
on the notice you receive.) If you get no satisfaction, ask to speak to an IRS col-
lections manager. This person should speak with you about your dispute within
a day of your request. If you don’t like what the manager tells you either, ask to
have your dispute forwarded to an appeals officer.
If an IRS revenue agent contacts you about an IRS decision — for example, she
tells you how much the IRS has decided you owe — and if you want to appeal
the decision, ask to have a conference with a collections manager. If the meet-
ing doesn’t resolve your problem, file a request for an appeal with the IRS Office
of Appeals right away by completing IRS Form 9423, “Collection Appeal
Request.” You can download the form at www.irs.gov/pub/irs-
pdf/f9423.pdf or get it by calling 800-839-3676. The IRS must receive your
request within two days of the meeting. Otherwise, it can resume its efforts to
collect from you. If you file your request for an appeal on time, the appeals offi-
cer decision is legally binding on you and on the IRS.
 The Collection Due Process (CDP): You can pursue this kind of appeal if you
receive a tax lien notice or a levy notice from the IRS. In most instances, you
must file your appeal with the IRS Office of Appeals within 30 days of receiving
the notice. Fill out IRS Form 12153, “Request for a Collection Due Process
Hearing,” which you can obtain at www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f12153.
pdf. During the 30-day period and while your appeal is being considered, the
IRS will put its collection actions on hold, as long as it does not think that its
ability to collect from you may be in jeopardy. For example, it may not put things
on hold if it believes that you are getting ready to transfer or hide an asset that
it wants to take from you.

After you get the tax lien released, the IRS sends you a “Release of
Federal Tax Lien” notice. It also files that notice with your county
courthouse so the public records reflect the fact that the agency
no longer has a lien on your assets.
When you receive the IRS notice, contact the three national credit
bureaus in writing and ask them to remove the tax lien information
from your credit files. Attach a copy of the IRS notice to your letter.
A month or two later, check your credit histories to find out if the
information has been removed. If you have problems getting the
lien information removed, contact a consumer law attorney who
has experience resolving problems with credit reporting agencies.
Losing your assets because of a levy
A levy is a powerful collection tool that the IRS can use to seize your
real or personal assets. For example, it may levy on the money in
your bank accounts; your home and other real estate you own; your
car, motorcycle, boat, or RV; and so on. It may also take any commis-
sions you earn and any dividends and rental income you receive. It
can also take money out of your retirement account, seize the cash
value of your life insurance policy, and garnish your wages.
(In some states, you can be fired just because the IRS is garnishing
your wages. For example, if you are responsible for a lot of money,
your employer may fire you out of concern that your financial
problems may cause you to steal from the business.)
Usually, the IRS won’t levy on your assets unless you’ve ignored all
its efforts to get you to pay what you owe, or your efforts to pay
your debt through an installment plan or with an OIC have not
worked out. The bigger your debt, the more likely that the IRS will
try to seize some of your assets.
If you do nothing to stop the levy, the IRS eventually serves you
with a “Notice and Demand for Payment,” a “Final Notice of Intent
to Levy,” and a “Notice of Your Right to a Hearing.” These papers
are served no less than 30 days before a levy is scheduled to occur.
Chapter 14: Catching Up on Your Federal Taxes 227
When the hearing is over, the IRS sends you a letter telling you what the Office
of Appeals has decided. If you agree with the decision, you and the agency must
abide by it. However, if you don’t agree, you have 30 days from the date that the
decision was issued to request a judicial review in federal tax court or in a U.S.
District Court. If the court reviews your case and decides in favor of the IRS, it’s
the end of the road for you.

If you’re not already working with a bankruptcy attorney, get one
pronto. The attorney may be able to stop the levy or at least put it
on hold to give you more time to figure out what to do. For exam-
ple, you may decide to appeal the agency’s levy plans. However,
you have a limited amount of time to appeal, so don’t dillydally.
(The sidebar “Appealing an IRS decision” provides a broad expla-
nation of how the appeals process works.)
For the best results, never handle your own appeal. Hire a CPA or a
tax attorney who understands the appeals process and the lingo to
help you.
If the levy moves forward and the IRS takes one or more of your
assets, you can appeal its action, assuming you can make a case
that the agency did not follow all the legally required procedures
related to a levy.
If the IRS levies on your bank account, the bank cannot give your
funds to the IRS for 21 days, which gives you time to figure out how
to avoid the loss of your money. As soon as you find out that the
IRS is going to levy on your bank account, meet with a bankruptcy
attorney because filing for bankruptcy will stop the levy. If you
don’t file or you don’t file in time, the bank sends the money in
your account, up to the amount of your tax debt, to the IRS.
The IRS can levy on any bank accounts that have your name on
them even if the funds are not for your own use. For example, if
your name is on your mother’s checking account so you can help
manage her financial affairs, that account is in jeopardy as well.
If the IRS takes one of your assets
When the IRS seizes one of your assets, it uses newspaper advertis-
ing and fliers to let people know the asset will be sold in a public
auction. Then it must wait at least ten days to conduct the sale.
Before the sale, the IRS decides on a minimum bid amount for your
property. Usually that amount equals about 80 percent of the
forced sale value of your asset less the amount of any liens other
creditors may have on it. (For example, the IRS took your car and
your bank has a $5,000 lien against it, or the IRS seized your home
and your mortgage company has a $100,000 lien on it.) If you think
that the minimum bid amount set by the IRS is too low, you can file
an appeal to ask the agency to either recompute the amount or use
a private appraiser to make the calculation.
After your property is sold, the IRS uses the sale proceeds to reim-
burse itself for the costs it incurred taking and selling your prop-
erty. Then it applies any money left over to your tax debt. If there
is not enough to pay that debt in full, you have to pay the balance.
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
228

If your property sells for more than enough to reimburse the IRS
for the expenses it incurred taking and selling your property and to
pay off your tax debt, you’re entitled to ask for the IRS to give you
whatever money is left. However, if your creditors have liens on
your assets and they file claims with the IRS, the IRS will pay their
claims with the leftover money before it pays you a dime.
Chapter 14: Catching Up on Your Federal Taxes 229
You’ve got a friend at the IRS
The Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS) is an independent agency within the IRS
charged with protecting the rights of taxpayers. Its main office is in Washington,
D.C., but it has at least one local office in every state. For contact information for
the office nearest you, go to www.irs.gov/advocate and click on “Contact Your
Advocate” and then “View Local Taxpayer Advocates By State.” Or you can call
877-777-4778. The local offices report directly to the national TAS office, not to 
the IRS.
You can ask the TAS for help if you’re unable to resolve an issue related to your tax
debt despite following the appropriate IRS rules and procedures, including those
that apply to the IRS appeals process. For example, you believe that an IRS
employee didn’t follow IRS rules or didn’t act in a timely manner and that you were
harmed or will be harmed as a result. The TAS will not help you just because you dis-
agree with an IRS decision.
You can also ask the TAS for help if you believe that you will suffer “a significant
economic hardship” as a result of an action that the IRS is about to take or has 
taken — seizing one of your assets, for example, or garnishing your wages.
Examples of “a significant economic hardship” include not being able to pay for
necessities such as food, shelter, and clothing; not being able to get to work; and
possibly putting your job at risk. Medical emergencies usually qualify too. The TAS
may respond to a hardship by issuing a Taxpayer Assistance Order (TAO) in order
to stop an IRS collection action.
After the TAS office in your area receives your request for help, a case advocate
reviews it, listens to your point of view, and determines if you have legitimate cause
for complaint. If your problem falls within the purview of the TAS, someone is
assigned to help you. While the office is trying to resolve your problem, the IRS must
suspend certain kinds of collection actions. For example, it may not put a lien on
your assets or levy one of your assets until it knows the outcome of the TAS efforts.
File IRS Form 911, “Application for Taxpayer Assistance Order,” to ask the TAS for
help. You can download this form at www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f911.pdf
or obtain a copy at your local IRS office. You can also call 800-829-3767 and ask to
have a copy of the form mailed to you.

Getting the asset back from the IRS
You may be able to get the asset back from the IRS before it’s sold
if one of the following is true:
 You pay the agency the full amount you owe.
 The agency decides that the cost of selling the asset will
exceed what you owe.
 You can prove to the IRS that having the property back will
help you pay your tax bill.
 The agency’s Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS) determines
that returning the property to you is in your best interest and
in the best interest of the government. For example, some of
your real estate has toxic chemicals on it, and the IRS decides
that you should incur the cost of cleaning up the chemicals.
The sidebar “You’ve got a friend at the IRS” explains what the
TAS does and doesn’t do.
You can also request that the IRS return the property to you —
even after it’s been sold — if you can prove that the IRS did not do
the following:
 Provide you with all the legally required notices before taking
your property, or give you the proper amount of time to
respond to one of its notices.
 Follow established agency procedures. For example, before it
took your asset, the IRS did not confirm exactly how much
you owed to it; the IRS failed to make certain that you had
equity in the asset it took; or the agency did not ensure that it
couldn’t collect from you in some other way.
 Abide by the terms of the installment payment plan you nego-
tiated with the agency (if the agreement states that the IRS
will not levy on your property).
If the IRS sells some of your real estate, you can redeem or buy it
from whoever purchases it within 180 days of the sale. However,
you must be able to pay the same amount that the buyer paid for
your property plus interest at an annual rate of 20 percent.

Taking Responsibility for Your
Federal Student Loan
In This Chapter
 Understanding your repayment responsibilities
 Taking steps to avoid a loan default
 Finding out about loan consolidation and cancellation
I
t’s pretty easy to get federally guaranteed student loans to help
pay for your college education, assuming you have the patience
to complete all the application paperwork. The hard part, given
how much you may owe when you graduate, is repaying those
loans. These 2004 statistics from the Project on Student Debt help
illustrate the problem:
 More students than ever before are borrowing money to
finance their college educations, and the amounts that they
are borrowing are larger than ever before. In just seven years,
the amounts they borrowed increased a whopping 60 percent.
 About two-thirds of college graduates now owe on student
loans, compared to less than 50 percent in the early 1990s.
 Over the last two decades, the amount of debt per student
has tripled after adjusting for inflation.
 Since 1993, the number of students graduating with high
levels of student loan debt — at least $40,000 — has increased
tenfold. According to the Project on Student Debt, most recent
college graduates would have difficulty repaying this amount
over ten years, which is the average student loan repayment
period.
 More than 40 percent of all college graduates who don’t
pursue a graduate education point to the amount that they
owe in student loans as the reason.

Being saddled with a substantial loan debt after graduation is
tough, especially if your job pays less than what you hoped for
when you borrowed the money. However, when it’s time to start
paying back what you borrowed, your student loan lender won’t
care about any of that. Your lender expects you to repay the
money according to the terms of your loan agreement. If you don’t,
you face serious consequences that can affect your ability to
pursue your post-graduation plans like buying a new car and
becoming a homeowner.
In this chapter, we help you meet your federal student loan obliga-
tions. We explain your options for repaying your loan, and we
review the various steps you can take to avoid defaulting on the
debt if you have problems keeping up with the payments. We also
tell you when you may be eligible to have all or part of your stu-
dent loan debt cancelled, and we explain the pros and cons of con-
solidating multiple student loans.
Preparing to Pay Back 
Your Student Loan
If you finance your college education with a federal student loan,
you must repay the loan after you graduate, drop out of school, or
stop attending school on at least a half-time basis. Depending on
your specific type of loan, you have a grace period of six or nine
months before your payments must begin. (See the next section for
a summary of the different types of federal student loans.)
Use your grace period wisely by making preparations to pay off
your student loan debt. Your preparations should include the 
following:
 Get clear about exactly what kind of student loan you have.
This is important because the type of loan affects not only the
length of your loan grace period but also your loan repayment
options, the interest rate you’re charged, who to contact if you
begin having problems repaying the loan, and so on. If you are
not sure what kind of loan you have, review your student loan
paperwork or go to the U.S. Department of Education’s (DOE)
National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) at www.nslds.
ed.gov/nslds_SA. You can also use this site to keep track of
the outstanding balance on your loan.
 Find a job so you’ll have the money you need to make each
of your loan payments. See Chapter 5 for job-finding advice.
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
232

 Prepare a monthly budget. Your budget will help you allocate
your dollars to meet your financial obligations. In Chapter 4,
we provide a quick and easy lesson on budgeting basics.
 Choose a loan repayment plan. The upcoming “Choosing a
loan repayment plan” section reviews your options.
Depending on what kind of student loan you have, interest may
begin to accrue during the grace period. You can pay the loan
interest each month, or you can opt to have all the accrued inter-
est added to the loan’s outstanding balance so you can repay the
interest later.
At the start of your grace period, a financial aid officer from your
school explains your responsibilities as a borrower and provides
you with information about your student loan, your repayment
options, who to send your payments to, when your first payment is
due, and what will happen if you ignore your obligation to repay
your student loan. Also, sometime during the grace period, your
federal student lender or loan servicer contacts you about repaying
your student loan. If the end of your grace period draws near and
you’ve not heard from anyone, contact your lender immediately.
Clarifying the kind of federal 
student loan you have
There are two basic federal student loan programs, each com-
prised of a number of various low-interest loans. One loan program
is administered directly by the U.S. Department of Education
(DOE). Individual lending institutions administer the loans within
the other program.
 Direct Loan Program: Loans within this program are made
directly by the DOE. They include Direct Subsidized Loans,
Direct Unsubsidized Loans, Direct PLUS Loans, and Direct
Consolidation Loans. (We discuss PLUS loans in the sidebar
“For parents only: Repaying a federal PLUS loan.” We cover
Direct Consolidation Loans in the section “Consolidating Your
Student Loans.”) If you have one of these kinds of loans, DOE’s
Direct Loan Servicing Center collects and processes all your
loan payments.
 Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFEL): Loans under
this program include subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford
loans, FFEL PLUS Loans, and FFEL Consolidation Loans.
Private lending institutions administer all these loans. (We dis-
cuss PLUS loans in the sidebar “For parents only: Repaying a
Chapter 15: Taking Responsibility for Your Federal Student Loan 233

federal PLUS loan.” You can find out about FFEL Consolidation
Loans in the section “Consolidating Your Student Loans.”)
When it comes time to repay these loans, you either deal
directly with the lending institution that gave you the loan or
with a loan servicer — a company hired by the lending institu-
tion to collect and process your loan payments.
There is a third kind of low-interest federal loan called a Perkins
Loan. If you have one, you got it when you applied directly to the
school you attended. When you repay a Perkins Loan, you send
your payments directly to the school or to a loan servicer hired by
the school.
Choosing a loan repayment plan
During the grace period after you graduate or leave school, you
choose one of four plans for repaying your Direct or FFEL student
loan. The plan you choose determines the amount of your loan pay-
ments, how long it will take you to repay your loan, and so on. If you
don’t choose a plan, you are automatically put in a standard plan.
After you choose a repayment plan, you can switch to a different
one if you decide that your first choice doesn’t work for you or if
your financial circumstances change. You can switch plans as often
as you like if you have a Direct Loan, but if you have a FFEL Loan,
you can make a plan change just once a year.
If you have a Perkins Loan, your school determines the amount of
your monthly payments. The school makes its decision based on
the amount of the loan and the length of your loan repayment
period, which will be no more than ten years.
If you have a Direct Loan, your debt repayment plan options are as
follows:
 Standard plan: This plan works much like a traditional bank
loan. Every month for a set period of time (up to ten years),
you make fixed payments of at least $50 until you’ve repaid
the amount of your loan plus interest. Your monthly payments
are higher with this plan than with the other plans, but the
total amount of interest you pay is less.
 Extended plan: This plan works like the standard plan except
you get between 12 and 30 years to repay your loan. Exactly
how long you get depends on how much you owe. Your
monthly payments with this kind of plan are smaller than with
the standard plan, but you pay more in interest over the loan
term.
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
234

 Graduated plan: With this kind of plan, your payments start
out small and gradually increase up to a certain amount. The
assumption is that when you are first out of school, you can’t
afford to pay much on your loan, but your income will
increase over time so you’ll be able to handle larger loan pay-
ments. Usually, you get 12 to 30 years to repay your loan with
this kind of plan; exactly how long you have depends on the
total amount of money you owe when it’s time to start paying
back the money you borrowed.
 Income-contingent plan: If you opt for this repayment plan,
the size of your monthly loan payments is recalculated every
year based on the adjusted gross income you reported on your
last IRS tax return. Your family size, the total amount of your
student loan debt, and the interest rate on the debt are also
considered. If your income is extremely low in a particular
year, it’s possible that you may not have to pay anything at all
on your student loan. Meanwhile, however, interest continues
accumulating so the total amount of your debt grows larger.
Here are your payment plan options if you have a FFEL Loan:
 Standard plan: This plan works like the standard plan for a
Direct Loan.
 Graduated plan: This plan works like the graduated plan for a
Direct Loan.
 Extended plan: You can use this plan if you owe more than
$30,000 in FFEL Loan debt. You get up to 25 years to repay the
debt, and your payments may be fixed or graduated.
 Income-sensitive plan: This kind of plan works much like the
Direct Loan income-contingent repayment plan.
For help making sense of the dollars and cents of each payment
plan, use the DOE’s interactive calculators at www.ed.gov/
offices/OSFAP/DirectLoan/calc.html. You can also talk to
your lender or to your school’s financial aid office.
If you opt for an income-contingent or income-sensitive repayment
plan and you have an outstanding loan balance after 25 years of
paying on your loan, the balance will be wiped out. For tax pur-
poses, however, the IRS treats the amount of the loan that is for-
given as income, which could create income tax problems for you
when April 15 arrives. (In Chapter 14, we explain your options when
you can’t afford to pay the taxes you owe.) The 25-year period does
not include any periods of loan deferment or forbearance. (We dis-
cuss deferments and forbearance later in this chapter.)
Chapter 15: Taking Responsibility for Your Federal Student Loan 235

If your payments are automatically debited from your bank
account, you may qualify for a reduced interest rate on your stu-
dent loan. Also, some lenders will reduce your rate after you’ve
made a certain number of consecutive monthly loan payments on
time. To find out if you are eligible for an interest rate reduction,
contact your lender if you have a FFEL Loan or call 800-848-0979 if
you have a Direct Loan.
Avoiding a Default
When your loan grace period is up, you are responsible for repay-
ing your loan. If you don’t make arrangements to pay back the
loan, and if you ignore all efforts by the student loan lender or loan
servicer to contact you about setting up a payment plan, you’re in
default.
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
236
For parents only: Repaying 
a federal PLUS loan
If you are the parent of a college student, you may be helping to finance your son
or daughter’s education with federal Direct or FFEL PLUS loans. These kinds of loans
differ from other types of federal student loans in some important ways:
 You, not your child, are legally obligated to repay them.
 You must begin repaying the loans while your child is still in college.
 There is no loan grace period.
 You cannot repay a Direct PLUS Loan through an income-contingent plan (but
an income-sensitive plan is usually an option if you have a FFEL PLUS Loan).
There are also many similarities between PLUS loans and the federal student loans
your son or daughter may have. For example,
 As long as your PLUS loan is not in default, you may be eligible for a loan defer-
ment or for forbearance if you are having trouble paying the loan.
 If you have multiple PLUS loans, you can consolidate them into a single loan.
 Under certain conditions, you can get your PLUS loan cancelled.
For more information about repaying a Direct PLUS Loan, contact the Direct Loan
Servicing Center at 800-848-0979. For information about repaying a FFEL PLUS Loan,
contact the lender who holds your loan.

You can also default on the loan if you don’t keep up with your pay-
ments. For example, if you have a Direct or FFEL loan and you’re
obligated to make monthly payments on the loan, you’ll be in
default after you are 270 days behind on the payments. If you are
repaying the loan on a different schedule, you’ll be in default after
you are 330 days in arrears. With a Perkins Loan, you’re in default
after you miss just one loan payment!
If the DOE holds your loan, you can avoid a default by using your
American Express, MasterCard, or Visa to catch up on what you
owe. To do so, call 800-621-3115.
Realizing the consequences
Defaulting on your student loan has serious consequences. For
example,
 The full amount of your outstanding loan balance, not just the
past-due amount, may be due immediately.
 The loan may be turned over to a debt collection agency.
 You will owe late fees and collection costs.
 Your credit history will be damaged.
 Your federal income tax refunds may be seized and applied to
the balance on your loan. Your state tax refunds may also be
taken, depending on your state.
 Your lender may sue you for the money you owe.
 Your wages may be garnished.
 In some states, you may be denied a professional license.
 You won’t be eligible for a loan deferment or forbearance.
 You won’t be entitled to additional federal financial aid,
including any financial aid you may apply for on your chil-
dren’s behalf.
 You could lose your eligibility for other federal loans, such as
loans from the Federal Housing Administration or from the
Veteran’s Administration. However, you can reinstate your eli-
gibility by paying the loan in full, by consolidating the loan
through either the FFEL or Direct loan consolidation pro-
grams, or by rehabilitating your loan through DOE’s loan
rehab program. We explain consolidation and rehabilitation
later in this chapter.
Chapter 15: Taking Responsibility for Your Federal Student Loan 237

Considering your options
The best way to avoid a default (aside from staying current on
your payments) is to contact your lender or loan servicer as soon
you realize you are going to have problems making your payments.
You should also review your budget (see Chapter 4) to see if you
can cut spending, and consider getting a second job to help cover
your loan payments. Another option may be to switch to a less
expensive repayment plan.
If none of these strategies works, you may need to pursue a loan
deferment or forbearance, or even file for bankruptcy in order to
avoid a default. We discuss all three options in detail in this section.
If you have multiple student loans and you’ve already defaulted 
on one or more of them, you may be able to avoid some of the con-
sequences of a default by consolidating the loans. Contact the
appropriate lender(s) to find out if you can consolidate. For more
information about student loan consolidation, read “Consolidating
Your Student Loans” later in this chapter.
Deferring payments
A loan deferment suspends your loan payments for a limited period
of time — usually for no more than three years. In other words,
during the deferment period, you won’t have to pay on your loan.
If the loan that you want deferred is an unsubsidized Stafford Loan,
interest accrues during the deferment period. As a result, you owe
more at the end of the period than you did at the start, unless you
arrange to pay the interest each month.
Although the exact process for getting a deferment depends on
your lender, it usually involves completing an application and
meeting certain eligibility criteria. For example, to be eligible for a
deferment, at least one of the following must apply:
 You’re unemployed.
 You’re enrolled at least half-time in an eligible school.
 You’re in a graduate fellowship program or in a rehabilitation
training program for the disabled.
 You’re serving in the military.
 You’ll suffer an economic hardship if you have to make your
loan payments.
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
238

If you’re paying on a Stafford Loan that you obtained prior to 
July 1, 1993, you may be entitled to receive a deferment for other
reasons besides the ones on this list. Talk to your lender or loan
servicer.
You’ll find additional information about the terms and conditions
of a loan deferment at the DOE’s Federal Student Aid Web site,
studentaid.ed.gov. Click on “Publications” on the right side of
the page and scroll down until you find the publication entitled
“Repaying Your Student Loans.” For specific information related to
your situation, contact your lender or loan servicer if you want to
defer payment on a Stafford Loan. If you want a deferment on a
Direct Loan, get in touch with the Direct Loan Servicing Center by
calling 800-848-0979. If you have a Perkins Loan, speak with the
school that gave you the loan.
While you’re waiting to learn if you’ve been approved for a loan
deferment, you must continue making your loan payments.
Otherwise, you risk defaulting on the loan. If that happens, you can
kiss your chances for a deferment goodbye.
Finding relief with forbearance
If you can’t get a loan deferment, you may be able to use forbear-
ance to avoid a loan default. Forbearance either postpones your
loan payments or reduces them for a specific period of time — 
typically between one and three years. You have to pay interest on
your loan during the forbearance period, but you can have the
accrued interest added to your outstanding loan balance so you
can pay it off over time.
To obtain forbearance, you must apply to your lender and prove
that your situation merits your getting a temporary break on your
student loan obligation. Possible reasons for getting forbearance
include the following:
 Your health is poor, or some other personal problem makes it
difficult for you to keep up with your loan payments.
 You have a medical or dental internship or residency.
 The amount that you must pay on your student loan (or
loans) is equal to or greater than 20 percent of your gross
monthly income. This reason applies only to certain types of
federal student loans.
Your lender may give you forbearance for other reasons. Contact it
to find out.
Chapter 15: Taking Responsibility for Your Federal Student Loan 239

Using bankruptcy to avoid a default
You can’t wipe out your outstanding student loan balance by filing
for bankruptcy, unless you get a hardship discharge, which is tough
to do. You have to be totally down and out financially to qualify for
a hardship discharge, and you must prove to the court that you
made a good faith effort to repay the loan before you filed for bank-
ruptcy. If you apply for a hardship discharge, a hearing is held, and
a bankruptcy judge determines whether you qualify. Your lender
attends the hearing to object to the hardship discharge.
Assuming that a hardship discharge is unlikely, you can still use
bankruptcy to avoid a default. For example, if you file a Chapter 7
liquidation bankruptcy, you won’t have to pay on the loan while
you are in bankruptcy. You’ll be expected to resume making your
payments after the bankruptcy is over. Since you can use Chapter 7
to eliminate other types of debts, you may improve your financial
situation enough that keeping up with your student loan obligation
after bankruptcy won’t be a problem.
If you file a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, you have three to five years to
pay the amount of your student loan — principal only — that is in
arrears. You cannot pay on the past-due interest while you’re in
bankruptcy; you must pay it afterwards. In addition, while you are
in Chapter 13, you must pay all your current loan payments as they
come due.
Turning Things Around 
after a Default
If you do default on your student loan, you can undo the damage
through a loan rehabilitation. Assuming you complete the rehabilita-
tion successfully, your loan is no longer in default, the information
related to the default is removed from your credit history, your
wages are no longer garnished, and you don’t have to worry anymore
about having your tax refunds seized. Also, your eligibility for future
federal student aid and other types of federal loans is reinstated.
To rehabilitate your student loan, you and the lender have to agree
on a rehabilitation plan, including
 How much your loan payments will be during the rehabilita-
tion period.
 How many payments you have to make. (Typically, you have
to make 12 consecutive on-time monthly payments.)
 When each payment is due.
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
240

The details of your rehabilitation plan depend on the type of loan
that’s in default and on the agreement between you and to the
lender.
After you satisfy all the terms of your loan rehabilitation agree-
ment, you have to resume paying on your loan according to the
terms of your original loan agreement. Also, if you rehabilitate a
FFEL Loan, the DOE makes the loan available for purchase by a
lending institution that participates in the FFEL program. In other
words, you may end up working with a different lender (and/or
loan servicer) than the one you were paying before your loan went
into default.
To find out more about how rehabilitation works and specific
details about the process for your particular type of loan, contact
the DOE’s Federal Student Aid Ombudsman at 877-557-2575. The
Ombudsman can answer questions about your student loans and
help you resolve loan-related disputes. For more information, go to
the Web site www.ombudsman.ed.gov.
Consolidating Your Student Loans
If you have multiple federal student loans, consolidating them into
a single loan may be a smart step. You and your spouse can even
consolidate all your individual federal student loans into a single
loan. Here are the potential benefits:
 You may be able to lower the overall interest rate you are
paying on your student loan debt and also lower the total
amount you pay on the debt each month.
 You can lock in a fixed interest rate, which is advantageous if
rates are low.
 Trading one payment for multiple payments means that you
are less apt to be late with a payment or miss a payment and
be charged fees and penalties as a result.
 You may be able to increase the amount of time you have to
repay your student loan debt and lower the amount of your
loan payments as a result. If you can, you get between 10 and
30 years to pay off the new debt; the exact amount of time
depends on how much student loan debt you owe and the
loan repayment option you choose when you consolidate. 
The downside of taking longer to pay off the debt is that you
could end up paying a lot more in interest over the life of your
loan — as much as 50 percent in certain circumstances.
Chapter 15: Taking Responsibility for Your Federal Student Loan 241

If you’ve defaulted on a student loan, you may be able to get out of
default by consolidating, assuming you and the lender can come to
terms and that you meet certain requirements.
With a few exceptions, all the same loan payment plans outlined in
the “Choosing a loan repayment plan” section of this chapter are
available to you when you consolidate. Contact the DOE if you want
to consolidate your Direct Loans. To consolidate FFEL Loans, shop
around for the best deal by contacting lenders who participate in
the FFEL program. However, if all the FFEL Loans you want to con-
solidate are with the same lender, you must consolidate through
that lender, unless you need to repay your new loan through an
income-sensitive plan and that lender doesn’t offer that plan.
If you can’t get an FFEL Consolidation Loan, or if you can’t get one
with income-sensitive terms that you can afford, you may be able
to consolidate by using a Direct Consolidation Loan.
Talk to your lender about all the downsides related to consolidat-
ing your student loans so you can weigh the advantages of making
that move against the disadvantages. For example, get clear about
the total cost of paying off a consolidated loan versus the total
cost of repaying the full amounts of the student loans you have
now. Also, take into account the financial benefits you may lose 
by consolidating, such as interest rate discounts, loan principal
rebates, and loan cancellation benefits, among others. Also, review
the DOE’s “Consolidation Checklist” at studentaid.ed.gov (click
on the “Repaying” tab and then on “Loan Consolidation”) to make
sure you are not overlooking any important considerations related
to consolidating your student loans.
You used to be able to consolidate Direct and FFEL student loans
while you were still in school. However, the federal Higher Education
Reconciliation Act of 2005 eliminated that option unless you’re
enrolled less than half-time. Now you cannot consolidate the loans
until you are out of college.
Canceling Your Student Loan
Under certain circumstances, and assuming your loan is not in
default, your lender may agree to cancel all or part of your student
loan. In other words, you won’t have to repay it. Yeah! Unfortunately,
you can’t get your loan cancelled just because you’re not able to
find a job, you didn’t complete your course of study (with a few
exceptions), or you are unhappy with the quality of the education
your loan helped to finance. You must have a much better reason for
a loan cancellation. Here are some examples:
Part III: Tackling Your High-Stake Debts 
242

 You can’t earn a living because you are totally and perma-
nently disabled due to an illness or injury, and your disability
is expected to last indefinitely or to result in your death.
 Your school closed before you were able to complete your
course of study or within 90 days of your withdrawal from the
school. However, you’re not eligible for a loan cancellation if
you are now completing a comparable course of study at
another school or if you haven’t received a diploma from the
closed school but you completed all your required coursework.
If you complete a course of study that is comparable to the
one you were pursuing at your former school before it closed,
and you have already obtained a discharge of your student
loan, you may have to pay back the amount of the loan that
was cancelled.
 You are a full-time teacher working in a low-income area, or
you are teaching a subject for which there is a teacher short-
age. To find more, go to studentaid.ed.gov. Click on the
“Repaying” tab and then on “Cancellation and Deferment
Options for Teachers.”
 You are pursuing a career for which there is a shortage of
workers.
Also, if you die, your survivors shouldn’t have to pay off your stu-
dent loan; the lender should cancel it.
If you don’t qualify for a loan cancellation based on the criteria in
the previous list, there may still be hope! You may be able to get all
or some of your federal loan cancelled, or you may be able to get
loan-paying assistance, if one of the following is true:
 You live in a state that rewards students who pursue specific
careers. These states either cancel these students’ loans or
pay off part of their loans. To find out if your state has such a
program and whether you qualify for it, get in touch with the
agency in your state that is responsible for postsecondary
education. To find out how to contact that agency, call
800-433-3243 or move your mouse to studentaid.ed.gov,
click on “Funding,” and then click on “State Aid.”
 You enlist in the military. Some branches of the armed serv-
ices use loan repayment programs as recruitment tools. To
find out more, visit your local recruitment office.
 You become an AmeriCorps volunteer. The AmeriCorps pro-
gram provides an opportunity for citizens to donate a year of
their lives to working with a nonprofit organization, public
agency, or community or faith-based organization that is
Chapter 15: Taking Responsibility for Your Federal Student Loan 243

addressing a critical community need. For more information
about AmeriCorps, contact the Corporation for National and
Community Service at 800-942-2677 or visit its Web site at
www.americorps.org.
If you have studied to be a registered nurse, you may qualify for
loan repayment assistance through the Nursing Education Loan
Repayment Program (NELRP), assuming you agree to work in an
area where there is a shortage of nurses. To find out about the pro-
gram’s terms and conditions, call the federal Bureau of Health
Professionals at 877-464-4772 or go to http://bhpr.hrsa.gov/
nursing/loanrepay.htm.
The process for getting a federal student loan cancelled is long and
involved. For more information about how the process works, con-
tact the Direct Loan Servicing Center at 800-848-0979 for a Direct
Loan or the lender or agency that holds your FFEL Loan. If you
have a Perkins Loan, get in touch with the school that gave you the
loan.

W
hen problems with debt have ruined your credit history, it’s
a good idea to begin the credit rebuilding process as soon
as possible so you can add new positive information to the record.
Eventually, as the amount of positive information in your credit
history increases, you become attractive to creditors again, and
you qualify for credit with more favorable terms.
New credit? You may be wondering why we would we want you to
owe money to creditors ever again. But we have our reasons!
The first reason is that debt is not necessarily a bad thing. What
distinguishes good debt from bad is the kind of debt and how
much you owe. Debt can actually be a positive force in your life
and a valuable money management tool.
The second reason is that having a credit history full of negative
information limits your opportunities and makes it difficult, if not
impossible, to achieve your financial goals. For example,
 Insurance companies may not be willing to sell you the
amount of life insurance you feel that you need, and/or they
may charge you more for your policies.
 A potential employer may be unwilling to give you a job.
 If you’re a renter looking for a new place to live, some land-
lords will refuse to rent to you.
In other words, a bad credit history closes a lot of doors.

The credit rebuilding advice that we provide in this chapter helps
you open those doors. We step you through the credit rebuilding
process, and we warn you against trying to accelerate the process
by working with a credit repair firm.
Before we turn our attention to the ins and outs of credit rebuild-
ing, we give you some basic information about the various types of
credit so that in the future, you’re better prepared to make smart
credit choices. We also explain how creditors evaluate you when
you apply for credit.
Separating Good Debt from Bad
Not all debt is bad. Whether your debt is good or bad depends on
the type of debt, the reason you owe it, and whether you can afford
to repay it. When used the right way, debt can help you manage
your finances more effectively, leverage your wealth, buy things
you need, and handle emergencies. But if you’re not careful, debt
can wreak havoc on your finances and destroy your dreams.
Debt can be a positive force in your life when it helps you
 Build your family’s net worth — the difference between the cur-
rent value of your assets and the amount of debt you owe. A
mortgage is a perfect example. Good debt is even better debt
when the value of the asset you finance increases over time.
 Buy something that will save your family money for years to
come. For example, you get a loan so you can weatherize your
home and lower your utility bills.
 Purchase something important or essential to your life that
you could never afford to buy if you had to pay for it with
cash. Examples of this kind of debt include a car loan and a
mortgage.
 Invest in yourself in order to increase your earnings potential.
For example, you borrow money to return to college or to
upgrade your skills so you can make more money in your cur-
rent field of work or move into a more lucrative career.
Student loans are a common example of this kind of debt.
 Pay for an unexpected emergency when you don’t have the
cash to cover it. For example, your car breaks down far from
home and you need to have it towed; or you have no health
insurance and your child needs expensive medicine.
However, debt can be a negative force in your life when you
Part IV: Avoiding Debt Problems down the Road 
248

 Go into debt to buy nonessential goods or services that do
not increase your wealth and have no lasting value. Examples
include restaurant meals, groceries, clothing, personal items,
and vacations. The longer you take to repay the debt and the
higher the interest rate on the debt, the worse the debt. Credit
card debt is the most common example of this kind of debt.
Credit card debt is not bad if you pay it in full as soon as you
receive your statement, or if you pay the debt in full within a
very few months and you don’t charge more on the card until
you’ve paid off the outstanding balance on your account.
 Secure the debt with your home or with another asset you
don’t want to lose when you’re not sure that you can afford to
repay the debt.
 Have a high interest rate and make low monthly payments. By
the time you pay off the debt, the amount you pay in interest
exceeds the value of the product or service you financed.
 Borrow money from dangerous lenders like advance fee
lenders, payday lenders, and finance companies.
Distinguishing Between the
Different Kinds of Credit
The word credit refers to a wide variety of products, each with its
own characteristics. To use credit wisely, you need to understand
the differences between each type. That way, you can match your
credit needs with the appropriate type of credit. Otherwise, you
may pay more than you should for the credit you get, which could
get you into serious trouble.
Defining secured and 
unsecured credit
All credit is either secured or unsecured. Usually, the more money
you want to borrow and/or the worse your credit history is, the
more likely it is that you’ll qualify only for secured credit.
When your credit is secured, the creditor has a lien on one of your
assets, which means that it can take the asset if you don’t repay
your debt according to the terms of the credit agreement. The
asset with the lien on it is referred to as your collateral.
Here are common examples of secured debts:
Chapter 16: Getting Good Credit Back 249

 Mortgage: The home you are financing usually secures this
kind of loan.
 Car loan: The car itself is the loan collateral.
 Home equity loan: Your home secures this kind of debt.
 Secured credit card: The money in your savings account or a
certificate of deposit (CD) collateralizes your secured credit
card. (Get the scoop on how secured cards work in the upcom-
ing section “Using a credit card to begin the rebuilding
process.”)
 Line of credit: Depending on the specific type of credit line, it
may be secured by your home, the funds in your bank
account, a certificate of deposit, or some other asset you own.
Two of the most common credit lines are a home equity line of
credit and a credit line associated with your checking
account. (The latter allows you to write checks for more than
the total amount of money in the account.)
Unsecured credit works quite differently. When a creditor gives
you this kind of credit, it simply accepts your word that you’ll
repay your debt according to the terms of your agreement with
one another. You give your word by signing on the dotted line. If
you go back on your word and you don’t respond to the creditor’s
demands for payment or to the calls of the debt collector the credi-
tor may hire, the creditor may sue you to try to collect its money.
Following are examples of unsecured debts:
 Some bank loans: Unsecured bank loans are called signature
loans.
 Most MasterCard and Visa cards: When you are approved for
this type of credit, you agree to pay at least a minimum
amount each month on your card balance.
 American Express cards: Depending on the type of American
Express card you have, you must either pay the card balance
in full each month or you can pay it over time like you can
with a MasterCard or Visa.
 Retail store and gasoline charge cards: You must repay these
kinds of cards the same way that you must repay a MasterCard
of Visa, by paying at least the minimum due each month.
Looking at credit another way
Another way to look at credit is according to whether it’s install-
ment, open-end; installment, closed-end; or non-installment credit.
Part IV: Avoiding Debt Problems down the Road 
250

(Another term for installment credit is revolving credit.) What do
these terms mean?
 Installment, open-end credit: Most credit cards fall into this
category. You are given a fixed amount of credit — your credit
limit — that you can use however you want and whenever you
want. When you use the credit, you must pay at least a mini-
mum due amount each month, and you can also pay the full
amount that you owe right away.
 Installment, closed-end credit: You are given a fixed amount
of credit to be used for a specific purpose. For example, you
buy a couch from a local retailer who finances the purchase.
In return, you must pay a set amount of money to the retailer
each month until you’ve repaid your debt, including whatever
interest you are charged. Other examples of this kind of credit
include car loans, mortgages, and student loans.
 Non-installment credit: This kind of credit often comes with a
very high credit limit, but you must pay the full amount of the
credit that you use when you receive your bill. The traditional
American Express card is a good example of this kind of
credit. Also, if your local grocery store allows you to sign for
groceries and then expects you to pay for all your purchases
at the end of each month, you’re feeding your family by using
non-installment credit.
Seeing Yourself the Way 
Creditors See You
Whenever you apply for credit, reputable creditors evaluate your
application according to three basic criteria: your character,
capacity, and collateral. They decide how you measure up against
these three criteria by reviewing your credit history and checking
out your credit score. They may also ask you to provide them with
detailed information about your assets and debts.
Your credit history (or credit record) is a record of how well or
how poorly you’ve managed your finances over time. The more
negative information there is in your credit history, the more diffi-
cult it is for you to qualify for credit with attractive terms. In fact, if
your credit history is in really bad shape, some creditors may
refuse to give you any credit at all. Others may give you credit only
if you collateralize it with an asset you own, which means that if
you don’t own an asset you can use as collateral, you won’t qualify
for the credit.
Chapter 16: Getting Good Credit Back 251

When creditors check out your credit score, they probably look at
your FICO score. Although other types of credit scores exist, this is
the one most creditors use. Your credit score is based in large part
on your credit record information, so the better that information
is, the higher your score will be. In Chapter 2, we fill you in on what
you can do to boost your score.
Here’s how the three C’s of credit work:
 Your character: To assess your character, creditors review
your credit record information to find out if you’ve failed to 
pay your credit accounts on time, stopped paying your child
support, been sued by any of your creditors, filed for bank-
ruptcy, and so on. Although having this sort of information in
your credit history does not necessarily mean that you’re a bad
person, it’s definitely not helpful when you apply for credit.
 Your capacity: Creditors don’t want to give you credit unless
they think you can afford to repay it. To make that determina-
tion and to figure out how much credit to give you, creditors
review your income, find out the amount of debt you already
have, and perhaps evaluate your assets. Creditors also review
your credit history to see if you’ve applied for a lot of credit
recently. If you have, they may decide that you’re a big credit
risk; they’ll either not give you any credit or give you less than
you ask for. They may also charge you a higher rate of interest
and may require that you secure the debt with an asset.
 Your collateral: If you apply for a lot of credit or if your credit
history is not great, creditors want to know if you have assets
that you can use to secure the credit you want. If you don’t,
they will probably turn down your request for credit.
Rebuilding Your Credit History
If your credit history reads like a horror novel, how do you begin
to repair it? Get started as soon as your financial situation has sta-
bilized: You’re living on a budget, you’ve resolved all your debt
problems, and/or you’ve completed your bankruptcy, for example.
The credit rebuilding process is not difficult, but it takes time. Your
goal is to add positive information to your credit history by obtain-
ing a small amount of new credit from a reputable creditor, paying
it off according to the terms of your credit agreement, obtaining
additional credit and paying it off on time, and so on.
Don’t sabotage your credit rebuilding efforts by applying for a lot
of credit right away. Rebuilding your credit should be a gradual,
measured process. Easy does it!
Part IV: Avoiding Debt Problems down the Road 
252

At the same time that you are applying for small amounts of credit
and paying it off on time, the negative information in your credit
history starts to go away because federal law says most of it can
be reported for only seven years and six months. (However, a
bankruptcy can remain in your credit history for ten years, and if
you’ve defaulted on your student loan or your child support obli-
gation, that information sticks around until you’ve cleared up the
debts. Federal tax liens are reported until you pay what you owe
and get the liens released.)
As long as you manage your finances responsibly while you’re
rebuilding your credit, the amount of positive information in your
credit history will gradually increase. Also, as time goes on, credi-
tors will pay more attention to the positive information you’re
adding than to any bad information that still remains in your credit
history. Eventually, you have a credit history you can be proud of!
If there are underlying reasons for your financial problems — you
overspend for emotional reasons, or you’ve got a gambling addic-
tion, for example — rebuilding your credit before you deal with
your demons is a dangerous waste of time. That’s because after
you rebuild your credit, you’re likely to ruin it again (and again 
and again).
Laying the groundwork 
for credit rebuilding
Before you begin the credit rebuilding process, you need to get
some preliminaries out of the way. These preliminaries help you
ensure that the process goes smoothly:
 Order a copy of your credit history from each of the three
national credit-reporting agencies. Review each record 
for errors, and correct any inaccuracies you find. The last
thing you need when your credit histories are already full of
negative-but-true information is for them to contain negative-
but-false information too!
Each year, you’re entitled to a free copy of your credit history
from each of the three national credit bureaus. In Chapter 2,
we explain how to order yours.
Common credit record errors include the following:
• Accounts that don’t belong to you. Watch out! These
accounts may be a sign that you’ve been the victim of
identity theft, or they may be the result of an error on the
part of the credit bureau that is reporting the information.
Chapter 16: Getting Good Credit Back 253

• Incorrect information about your accounts. For example,
your credit report wrongly indicates that you defaulted
on a loan or that you paid your MasterCard late, or some
of your credit account numbers are wrong.
• Information about some of your accounts is incomplete.
For example, your credit report does not show that you
paid off a loan, got a federal tax lien released, or com-
pleted your Chapter 13 bankruptcy.
• Negative account information that is too old to be reported
still shows up.
• Some of your identifying information (like your Social
Security number, name, or address) is wrong. These kinds
of errors can cause your credit information to be con-
fused with someone else’s. As a result, that other
person’s information could end up in your report.
Correcting credit record problems isn’t always easy. If you
need some tips, check out The Credit Repair Kit by John
Ventura (Kaplan Publishing) or Credit Repair Kit For Dummies
by Stephen R. Bucci (Wiley).
After you correct an error in your credit history, order
another copy of that record a month or two later to make sure
the erroneous information has not returned. Sometimes,
credit reporting agencies mistakenly reinsert erroneous infor-
mation after that information has been corrected.
 Find out your FICO score. This is the credit score most credi-
tors use to get a quick measure of how your credit compares
to other debtors. It’s derived from your credit record informa-
tion. Generally, the higher your credit score, the more attrac-
tive you are to creditors; the lower your score, the harder it is
to get credit, and the more the credit you get will cost you. A
score between 650 and 700 is good; a score above 700 is stel-
lar. Go to www.myfico.com to get your score.
 Start saving. A savings account is the foundation of most
credit rebuilding. In fact, it may be impossible for you to
rebuild without having money in savings. If you have not
already begun stashing money away on a regular basis, start
now. Save as much as you can each month, even if it’s not a lot.
For credit rebuilding purposes, you should have at least $1,000
in a savings account. However, don’t stop there. You also need
money in savings so you can pay for unexpected expenses
with cash rather than with a credit card. Ideally, you should
have at least six months worth of living expenses in savings so
that if you lose your job or you can’t work for a while because
of an illness or accident, you can still pay your bills.
Part IV: Avoiding Debt Problems down the Road 
254

An easy way to save is to have your employer automatically
deduct money from your paychecks and direct deposit the
funds into your savings account.
Using a credit card to begin 
the rebuilding process
After you’ve taken care of the credit rebuilding preliminaries, apply
for a MasterCard or a Visa. Look for one with attractive terms of
credit, and don’t accept a credit card offer until you’ve read the
card agreement from start to finish. The sidebar “Credit card com-
parison criteria” explains the terms to consider.
Credit card companies are entitled to change the terms of your
credit card whenever they want, as long as they tell you about the
change at least 15 days prior to its effective date. They may make a
change because a lot of negative information has been added to
your credit history since they gave you credit or because your
credit score has dropped. Sometimes a creditor makes a change 
in credit terms that applies to all its cardholders.
You can use your MasterCard or Visa card in one of two ways to
rebuild your credit:
 Use your card to make small purchases each month, and then
pay the card balance in full and on time.
 Use your card to buy something relatively expensive, and pay
off the card balance over time. (Make sure you’re buying
something you need; don’t make a nonessential purchase just
for the sake of rebuilding your credit!) After you’ve paid off
the first balance, charge something else and pay off that bal-
ance too. Always try to pay more than the minimum due each
month, and avoid charging anything else on the card until
you’ve paid off each balance.
If you have too much negative information in your credit history,
you may not qualify for a regular MasterCard or Visa right away.
Instead, you may have to apply for a secured card. If you use the
secured card responsibly, you’ll eventually qualify for an unse-
cured MasterCard or Visa.
A secured MasterCard or Visa card looks exactly like an unsecured
card. The difference is that the bank issuing the secured card
requires that you secure your purchases by depositing a certain
amount of money in a savings account at the bank or by purchas-
ing a certificate of deposit (CD) for a certain amount of money.
Chapter 16: Getting Good Credit Back 255

Part IV: Avoiding Debt Problems down the Road 
256
Credit card comparison criteria
Some credit cards are better than others. Generally speaking, credit cards with low
interest rates and low fees are more attractive than cards with higher rates and
fees.
The federal Truth in Lending Act makes it easy to compare credit card offers
because it requires credit card companies to give you specific written information
about the terms of the credit card you apply for or the credit card they offer you
when they send you a preapproved offer. (Lenders must give you this same infor-
mation when you apply for a bank loan.) Here are some of the terms of credit that
creditors must provide:
 Annual percentage rate (APR): This is the cost of the credit expressed as an
annual rate. Pay close attention to a card’s default APR — the rate you end up
paying if you make a payment late (or pay some other creditor late), you exceed
your credit limit, or your credit score drops below a certain amount. Your APR
could triple depending on the terms of the credit offer!
 Balance calculation method: When you carry a balance on your credit card,
the credit card company figures out how much interest to add to that balance
by using one of several different methods. Some methods cost you more in inter-
est than others. The least expensive balance calculation methods are adjusted
balance and average daily balance excluding new purchases. The most expen-
sive are two-cycle average daily balance including new purchases and two-
cycle average daily balance excluding new purchases.
 Fees: Credit card fees can be really costly, so look for cards that have few and
low fees. Examples of common fees include an annual or membership fee, a
late fee, a bounced check fee, a fee for exceeding your credit card limit, and a
balance transfer fee. Believe it or not, some cards charge you a fee every time
you use them or because you don’t use them often enough!
 Grace period: This is the amount of time you have to pay the full amount of your
card balance after the end of the last billing cycle before you’re charged inter-
est on the balance. The longer the grace period, the better; a 25-day grace
period is probably the best you’ll do. Some cards have no grace period; avoid
them if you expect to carry a balance on your credit card.
 Periodic rate: This is the rate of interest you’re charged each day on your card’s
outstanding balance. If you expect that you may carry a balance on your credit
card, get the lowest rate you can. The rate may be fixed or variable, but even a
fixed rate isn’t truly fixed because a creditor can raise it at any time after it gives
you 15 days notice. Also, pay attention to the interest rates that apply to bal-
ance transfers, cash advances, and other transactions you may make with a
credit card. These rates won’t be the same as the periodic rate.

Your credit limit on the card is a percentage of the money in your
savings account or the value of the CD. If you don’t pay your credit
card according to the terms of your credit agreement, the bank
that gave you the card is legally entitled to get paid by tapping
your collateral up to the amount of your outstanding card balance,
including interest and fees. Also, the card issuer may close your
account or ask you to put up additional collateral to keep the
account open.
You should shop for a secured credit card by evaluating the same
terms of credit that you should consider when you’re in the market
for a regular credit card (see the sidebar “Credit card comparison
criteria”). However, you also need to consider some additional cri-
teria for secured cards:
 How much collateral you must put up to get the card. The
less, the better, because you won’t have access to that money.
 Whether you earn interest on your collateral, and at what
rate.
 The size of your credit limit and whether you can increase it.
To increase it, you may have to give the credit card company
additional funds for collateral, and you need a record of on-
time card payments.
 When the card issuer can tap your collateral.
 Whether you can covert the card to an unsecured card at
some point, the terms of the conversion, and the terms that
will apply to the card after it becomes unsecured. For exam-
ple, will you have to pay a fee to convert? What will the inter-
est rate be on the card after you do convert? Will the rate be
fixed or variable? What will your credit limit be?
 If you cancel your credit card account, how quickly you’ll get
back your collateral, and under what conditions you can get
your collateral back if the credit card company cancels your
account.
Some companies other than banks issue secured cards to con-
sumers, but don’t deal with them. They won’t report your pay-
ments to any of the national credit bureaus, so having one of their
cards does not help you rebuild your credit history. Also, some of
these companies allow you to use your secured credit card only to
purchase items from a catalog of products that they provide.

Getting a loan: The next step 
in the rebuilding process
Applying for a bank loan (or for a loan from a savings and loan in
your area or a credit union you belong to) and paying it back on
time is the next step in the credit rebuilding process. Set up an
appointment with a loan officer at a bank in your area to discuss
your borrowing needs. The bank where you have your checking
and savings accounts is a good place to start.
When you meet with a loan officer, be upfront about the fact that
you’ve had financial problems. He’ll find out about them anyway
when he looks at your credit history. Explain what you have done
to improve your finances and avoid money troubles in the future.
Let him know that you have begun the credit rebuilding process
and, as part of the process, you would like a small bank loan.
If the first loan officer you talk to refuses to lend you money, try a
different bank. You may have to meet with loan officers at several
different banks before you find one willing to work with you.
If a bank turns you down for a loan, before you apply to another
bank make sure that you understand exactly why you didn’t get
the loan. Then address the reasons you got a thumbs down. Keep
in mind that sometimes, qualifying for a bank loan after financial
difficulties is just a matter of time; only more time can increase the
distance between you and your past problems.
If your credit history is full of very negative information — loan
defaults, accounts that were closed by your creditors, IRS tax liens,
creditor lawsuits, a bankruptcy, and so on — you may not find a
lender willing to give you a loan under any circumstances right
away. If that’s the case, bide your time and manage responsibly any
credit you already have. Eventually, you’ll be able to get a loan.
At first, you may qualify only for a small, secured loan — maybe
just $500 or $1,000. If you qualify for an unsecured loan, it will also
be for a relatively small amount of money, and the interest rate
may be a little higher than if the loan is secured.
After you are approved for a loan, make all your payments on time
and live up to all the other terms of your agreement with the
lender. Then after you’ve repaid the loan, order a copy of your
credit history from whichever credit reporting agency or agencies
the lender reports to so you can be sure that the loan-related
credit record information is accurate. If you find any errors, get
them corrected right away. Don’t apply for a second loan until
Part IV: Avoiding Debt Problems down the Road 
258

you’ve cleared up any problems in your credit history related to
the loan you’ve just paid off.
Next, apply for a second loan with either the lender that gave you
the first loan or with a different lender. If your first loan was
secured, this time you may qualify for an unsecured loan. If not,
apply for a second secured loan. Eventually, as your credit record
information improves, you’ll be able to obtain an unsecured loan.
Looking toward your credit future
Your financial life will start looking up as the credit rebuilding
process moves forward, assuming that you follow all the advice in
this chapter. Gradually, your credit history will become more posi-
tive than negative, and your FICO score will go up.
Periodically during the credit rebuilding process, order a copy of
your credit history from each of the three national credit reporting
agencies (see Chapter 2). Check each report to make sure the new
positive information you are adding to it is being reported accu-
rately, and look for other errors. If you find any problems, get them
corrected so they don’t derail your credit rebuilding efforts.
As you begin looking more attractive to creditors, you’ll qualify for
credit with lower interest rates and other consumer-friendly terms.
Assuming you don’t misuse the credit you apply for, it will help you
manage your family’s finances better, achieve your family’s finan-
cial goals, and gain financial peace of mind. In Chapter 17, we show
you how to keep your financial life on track after you have your
credit back.
As your credit history improves, you may be tempted to apply for
a lot of credit. Don’t! Every time you apply for credit, that fact
shows up in your credit history as an inquiry. The more inquiries
there are, especially within a relatively short period of time, the
more your credit history is damaged and the lower your FICO
score will be. Also, if you apply for too much credit, you may find
yourself drowning in debt all over again.
Steering Clear of Credit Rebuilding
Rip-Offs
Some consumers are so eager to obtain new credit after their
money troubles are over that they fall for the promises of credit
rebuilding organizations that claim they can make the negative
information in credit reports disappear, like magic. Steer clear of
Chapter 16: Getting Good Credit Back 259

these companies! They’re bad apples. Some use illegal methods to
get you a problem-free credit record; if you do what they tell you to
do, you’ll be breaking the law too, and you may even be prosecuted.
Recognizing unscrupulous methods
Typically, these firms use one of two methods to get you a 
problem-free credit history:
 The credit repair firm tells you to apply to the federal govern-
ment for an EIN (employee identification number) and use
that number rather than your Social Security number when
you apply for credit. Essentially, the firm is telling you to leave
your damaged credit history behind by making creditors think
you’re someone else. The firm is asking you to commit fraud.
Don’t do it!
 The firm disputes so much of the information in your credit
history that the credit reporting agency can’t respond to all
the disputes within the time frames established by the federal
Fair Credit Reporting Act. The law says that if a credit report-
ing agency does not resolve a dispute related to information
in your credit history by the legally required deadline, the dis-
puted information must be removed from your credit report
regardless of whether the information is accurate.
The problem with this credit rebuilding method is that even-
tually the credit reporting agency will probably determine
that the disputed information is accurate. At that point, the
agency will put the information back into your credit history.
If that happens, not only will you have wasted your money
working with the credit repair firm, but you may be charged
with fraud. If you are, you’ll have a much bigger problem than
a damaged credit history to deal with!
Part IV: Avoiding Debt Problems down the Road 
260
Credit-related laws and federal agencies
that can protect you
The federal government has passed an array of laws to protect you when you apply
for and use credit. Those laws include
 The Equal Credit Opportunity Act: When you apply for credit, this law prohibits
creditors from discriminating against you because of your race, country of
national origin, gender, age, religion, or marital status. Creditors are also pro-
hibited from discriminating against you because you receive public assistance.

Chapter 16: Getting Good Credit Back 261
 The Home Equity Loan Consumer Protection Act: This law requires lenders to
give you specific kinds of written information about the terms of a home equity
loan or home equity line of credit before you apply for it.
 The Truth in Lending Act: This law requires creditors to provide you with spe-
cific written information about the terms of their credit offers in order to help
you understand the cost of the credit and to make it easier for you to compare
credit offers.
If you believe that a creditor has violated your rights under one of these laws, you
can try to resolve the problem by
 Writing a complaint letter to the creditor.
 Contacting a consumer law attorney. Depending on the nature of your prob-
lem and the amount of money involved, the attorney may recommend filing a
lawsuit.
 Filing a formal complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) if your com-
plaint is with a creditor other than a bank, savings and loan, or credit union. You
can file a complaint online at www.ftc.gov or by calling 877-382-4357. It’s a
good idea to complain to the FTC even if you sue the creditor because if it
receives a lot of complaints about the creditor or about a particular practice
within the creditor’s industry, the FTC may file a class action lawsuit on behalf
of all consumers who have been harmed by the creditor or practice. Also, some-
times as a result of consumer complaints, Congress passes new legislation or
amends existing laws.
If a bank, savings and loan, or credit union has violated your legal rights, register a
complaint with the federal agency or office that oversees the lender. Exactly who
to contact depends on the kind of lender you want to complain about. Here are your
options:
 Federally chartered savings and loans and federal savings banks (FSBs):
Complain to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Thrift Supervision,
800-842-6929 or www.ots.treas.gov.
 State-chartered banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System:
Complain to the Federal Reserve System, Division of Consumer and Community
Affairs, 202-452-3693 or www.federalreserve.gov.
 State-chartered banks that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation but are not members of the Federal Reserve System: Complain to
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Division of Supervision and
Consumer Protection, 877-275-3342 or www.fdic.gov.
 Nationally chartered banks (which have the word national or the abbreviation
N.A. in their names): Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Consumer Affairs
Division, 800-722-2678 or www.occ.treas.gov.
 Federally chartered credit unions: Complain to the National Credit Union
Administration, Consumer Affairs Division, 703-518-6300 or www.ncua.gov.

Some credit rebuilding firms may not ask you to do anything ille-
gal, but they charge you a lot of money for helping you build a new
credit history even though they can’t do anything that you can’t do
yourself for little or no money. Also, by sharing your personal and
financial information with one of these firms, you make yourself
more vulnerable to identify theft because you can’t control who at
the company sees your information.
Knowing your rights
We know that despite our sage advice, you may decide to hire a
credit repair firm anyway. If you do, knowing your rights under the
federal Credit Repair Organizations Act (CROA) can help you avoid
getting ripped off. Here are some of the law’s protections:
 The credit repair firm must use a written contract to spell out
all the services it will provide to you and their total costs.
 After you sign the contract, the firm must give you three days
to change your mind about working with it.
 Before you sign the contract, the credit repair firm must pro-
vide you with a copy of a brochure called “Your Consumer
Credit File Rights Under State and Federal Law.”
 The firm cannot take any money from you until it has provided
you with all the services that it spelled out in your contract.
If a credit repair firm violates any of the terms of the CROA, your
contract with the firm is automatically cancelled, and you do not
owe the company one red cent, even if it did everything it specified
in its contract. Also, you can sue the credit repair firm for actual
and punitive damages. Actual damages represent what the firm’s
CROA violations actually cost you in dollars and cents. Punitive
damages represent money that the judge may order the credit
repair firm to pay you as punishment for breaking the law and to
help deter the firm from violating the provisions of the CROA again.
If you want to sue a credit repair firm, don’t act as your own
lawyer. Hire a consumer law attorney with specific experience han-
dling cases like yours. If you have a strong case, the attorney will
take it on contingency, which means that the attorney gets paid by
sharing in whatever money she may win for you. If you lose your
lawsuit, the only money you will probably owe the attorney is reim-
bursement for her expenses. Also, if you win, the credit repair firm
must reimburse you for whatever you pay to the attorney and for
your expenses.

Life after Too Much Debt:
Staying on Track
In This Chapter
 Using money management fundamentals
 Getting advice and assistance from financial pros
You’ve got your finances under control . . . finally! You’re worry-
ing less about money now and sleeping easier. Maybe you’ve
even begun to rebuild your credit history with an eye to the future.
Congratulations for facing your financial problems head-on and
turning your situation around.
Now you face a new challenge: You must continue moving your
financial life forward and not get hijacked by too much debt again.
In this chapter, we help you meet that challenge by reviewing key
fundamentals of sound money management. We also suggest
assembling a team of financial professionals to call on as you move
forward, and we explain how each professional can help.
Setting Financial Goals
Now that you are no longer putting every nickel and dime toward
your debts and essential expenses, you and your family members
have probably begun thinking about how to spend the money you
have left over each month, as well as about big-ticket items you
would like to finance. Thinking about how to spend your money is
fine. But if you start spending without having a plan, you are likely
to end up right back in the same financial mess you were in when
you first picked up this book. A far smarter approach is to estab-
lish your financial goals and then to use your household budget to
help achieve them. (See Chapter 4 for a refresher on budgeting.)

Your financial goals should be specific, realistic, time based, and
flexible. For example, “By the end of 2007, I will have three credi-
tors paid in full” or “By June 2007, I will have the money I need for
a down payment on a car.”
When you are setting your financial goals, place each goal into one
of three categories:
 Short-term goals: These are goals that you believe you can
accomplish within the next six months to one year, such as
putting a certain amount of money in your savings, paying off
a loan, outfitting your kids for the start of school, or having
enough money to join a health club.
 Medium-term goals: These are goals that you feel you can
achieve within the next five years, such as having enough
money for a down payment on a home, paying off a car loan,
or putting a certain amount of money in your retirement
account.
 Long-term goals: These are goals that you project will take
you longer than five years to achieve. They may include send-
ing your kids to college, having enough money to retire, taking
your dream vacation, and so on.
Be realistic about your goals and about how long it will take you to
achieve each one. If you are not, you’ll be setting yourself up for
frustration and disappointment.
A short-term goal for you may be a medium-term or even a long-
term goal for someone else. The specific category that a goal
belongs in depends on your particular financial situation and on
how quickly you want to achieve the goal.
Unless you are lucky enough to come into a financial windfall, you
probably can’t afford to work toward all your goals at the same
time. If you try to do so, you may spread yourself so thin finan-
cially that you don’t achieve any of them. Instead, prioritize your
goals so you know which goals to focus on first. Most likely you
will begin working toward short-term goals first because they are
probably the most pressing, but you may be able to work on some
of your medium- and long-term goals at the same time. For exam-
ple, maybe you want to pay off your car loan over the next six
months, and you also want to start stashing money away for a
down payment on a home with the goal of having the money you
need in two years.
After you decide which goals to work toward first, decide how
you’ll achieve each goal and set a realistic time frame for doing
Part IV: Avoiding Debt Problems down the Road 
264

what you’ve set out to do. For example, you may decide to get a
second job and put all the money you earn from it toward a certain
goal. You may decide to finance another goal through a combina-
tion of cash and credit. Revise your budget as necessary.
Building a Financial Safety Net
One of your very first financial goals should be to build up your
savings account so you have a financial safety net. Experts advise
that you contribute a minimum of 10 percent of your net income to
savings every month with the goal of having enough money in the
account that you can pay your living expenses for at least six
months if you lost your job. That account also allows you to pay
cash, not credit, if you are hit with an unexpected big expense.
If you draw down your savings, start building it up again right away.
Always be prepared for the next big expense or financial setback.
The easiest way to save is to have a set amount of money automati-
cally deducted from each of your paychecks and deposited directly
into your savings account. That way, you never have access to the
money so you won’t have to worry about spending it before it gets
in the bank. Also, you get used to living without it.
Be realistic about the amount of money you can afford to save each
month. If you decide to save $100 per paycheck and then you pull
out $99 from your savings account to pay for some of your living
expenses, you are defeating the purpose of your savings program.
Living with a Budget
In Part I of this book, we advise you to get your spending under
control and pay down your debts by living on a budget. We also
explain that a budget is a fundamental money management tool
(see Chapter 4).
Now that your financial situation has improved, you may be
tempted to toss your budget aside and just wing it when it comes
to spending your money. Bad idea! Although the numbers in your
budget will be different than they were when you had more debt,
your budget continues to serve the same purpose as it did before:
It helps you allocate your money wisely and know when you need
to cut back on your spending. Now you can also use your budget
to help you achieve your family’s financial goals. Without budget-
ing for them, those goals may never become realities.
Chapter 17: Life after Too Much Debt: Staying on Track 265

Be sure to review your budget periodically to make sure it continues
to reflect your family’s values and spending priorities. Also, be sure
to revise your budget whenever your financial situation changes.
Managing Your Credit
Throughout this book, we explain a lot about using and abusing
credit — as in what not to do. The same advice applies when your
finances are in better shape. Here are some of the key points:
 Minimize your use of credit. Pay with cash whenever possible,
even it if means that you can’t buy something right away
because you have to save for it.
 Avoid letting your credit card balances build. Pay them off as
quickly as you can.
 When you are in the market for credit, shop around for the
best terms of credit (see Chapter 16).
 Check your Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion credit histories
every six months, and correct any problems you find. Order
your FICO score twice a year as well (see Chapter 2).
 If you experience a financial setback and begin having prob-
lems paying your debts, get in touch with your creditors right
away. They are more apt to help you work out a way to avoid
a default if you get in touch before you fall behind on your
payments.
Most car lenders can take back your car without any advance
warning if you miss just one car payment (see Chapter 11).
 Whenever possible, avoid using your home as loan collateral
and borrowing against the equity in your home.
 Know your credit rights, and don’t be reluctant to exercise
them. If you need advice about how to handle a money-related
legal problem, consult with a consumer law attorney.
 Remember that credit offers that sound too good to be true
are usually bad deals for you or even scams. Steer clear.

Assembling a Team of 
Financial Advisors
As your finances improve, you’ll have more money to spend and
invest, your assets will grow (we hope), and Uncle Sam will want to
take a bigger bite out of your income. The more money and other
assets you have, the more important it is for you to have a team of
financial advisors in place who can answer your questions, help
you plan your finances, assist you with your taxes, and help you
avoid money-related problems. Depending on your particular situa-
tion and on how much of your financial planning and management
you want to do yourself, you may want to maintain an ongoing rela-
tionship with some of the advisors we list in this section, or you
may need their help only periodically.
It can be especially helpful to consult with financial professionals
just before or after important life events such as marriage, divorce,
the birth or adoption of a child, retirement, the death of a spouse,
the receipt of an inheritance, and so on. Each of these events can
have important implications for taxes, insurance, investing, and
estate planning.
Naming the players
Consider making the advisors on the following list part of your
financial team. Although you may not need their help right away,
we suggest that you identify the ones you’d like to work with
before you need their assistance:
 A certified public accountant (CPA): A CPA can help you
manage your money better, fine-tune your savings and invest-
ment strategies, and reduce the income tax you owe each
year. Some CPAs also prepare tax returns; in fact, some spe-
cialize in helping individuals deal with tax-related matters.
Part IV: Avoiding Debt Problems down the Road 
268

The more complicated your taxes — you own rental property,
you or your spouse is self-employed, you have a home office,
and so on — the more valuable the help of a tax CPA can be.
The CPA can help you avoid expensive mistakes that cost you
more in taxes and can suggest ways to minimize how much
you owe in taxes.
 A financial planner: A financial planner offers many of the
same services as a CPA; some CPAs are also financial planners.
A financial planner can help you develop a financial plan to
achieve your financial goals and assist you with the implemen-
tation of financial planning strategies. The financial planner can
also identify financial issues and problems you should address
and act as a sounding board when you are getting ready to
make a major purchase (like a home) or when you are thinking
about making a major life change (such as retiring). She can
help you be sure that you have thought through all the issues
related to taking that step. Financial planners can also help you
decide which investments make the most sense for you.
When you’re in the market for a financial planner, steer clear of
commission-based planners. They make their money by trying
to convince consumers to purchase financial products such as
insurance, mutual funds, and annuities — products a consumer
may or may not need. A better choice is to work with a fee-
based (or fee-only) planner. This sort of planner gets paid by
charging a percentage of the dollar value of the assets he man-
ages for you, like stocks, mutual funds, and bonds (but not real
estate). A third type of financial planner charges by the hour.
This kind of financial planner is most apt to take a big picture
look at your finances because he is not trying to sell your prod-
ucts or make money by managing your investments.
 An estate-planning attorney: This kind of attorney is not 
just for rich people. If you have assets and you want to be
sure that when you die they go to certain people, you need
this person’s help. He can advise you about various estate-
planning tools you may want to use in order to control who
ends up with your stuff; these tools include a will, a living
trust, an irrevocable trust, and life insurance. He can also 
help you plan for the management of your finances should
you become temporarily or permanently incapacitated and 
be unable to make your own financial decisions.
 An insurance broker or agent: Having adequate insurance is
an essential aspect of managing your finances and protecting
yourself from financial loss. Insurance can also be an impor-
tant part of your estate plan. An insurance agent or broker
advises you about your insurance needs, helps you find the
best insurance, and assists you when you’re having problems
with your insurance company.
Chapter 17: Life after Too Much Debt: Staying on Track 269

An insurance agent sells insurance for a specific company,
which means that if you work with an agent, your insurance
choices are limited. An insurance broker, on the other hand,
reviews all the insurance products on the market, or those
being sold by a wide range of companies, and identifies the
products that are best for you.
The assistance of financial advisors can be especially helpful if you
receive a substantial inheritance, are nearing retirement, have chil-
dren and want to begin planning for their college educations, expe-
rience a financial setback, begin making substantially more money
than you have earned in the past, and so on. Although their advice
and assistance cost money, the investment can save you lots of
money in the long run.
Finding reliable advisors
The best sources of referrals for the professionals you want on
your financial team are the friends, family members, and profes-
sional associates whose opinions you respect.
Get the names of several different CPAs, financial planners, and so
on. Meet with all of them to find out how they work, how they
charge for their services, and if the chemistry between the two of
you is right. Go to each meeting armed with a set of questions and
a pad of paper for taking notes.
Other sources of referrals to financial professionals include your
banker, a financial professional, and the consumer law attorney
you may have worked with to clear up your debt problems. Also,
organizations such as these can help:

dummies! We understand that you may need additional help and
information, including one-on-one assistance. So in this chapter we

ing more about how to use credit responsibly.
To write this chapter, we culled our data banks, consulted with our
associates, and searched the Web. We feel confident that when you

you gain from reading our book (not to mention with your own
hard work), you’ll soon be out of debt and on the road to wealth,

American Bankruptcy 
Institute (ABI)
If you think that filing for bankruptcy may be in the cards for you,
visit the ABI’s Web site to gain an overview of how the process
works. Go to www.abiworld.org and click on “Consumer
Education Center.”

While you’re there, you can also search for an ABI-certified con-
sumer bankruptcy attorney in your area. Attorneys who are ABI-
certified have demonstrated a special interest and expertise in
consumer bankruptcy law by passing a comprehensive, daylong
written ABI exam and committing to participate in at least 60 hours
of legal continuing education over a three-year period. ABI certifi-
cation is the gold standard in bankruptcy law certification.

addition, the site features a variety of online calculators and a free
e-mail newsletter.
A Consumer Bankruptcy Attorney
Consulting with a bankruptcy attorney is a smart step to take
before your finances are in desperate shape and you have no alter-
native but to file for bankruptcy. The attorney can provide you
with advice about how to avoid bankruptcy, when filing for bank-
ruptcy is a good idea, and what you should and should not do to
get the maximum benefit from filing. It’s best to work with a board-
certified bankruptcy attorney. Some states certify bankruptcy
attorneys, and the American Bankruptcy Institute provides quali-
fied bankruptcy attorneys with national certification.

Chapter 19
Ten Debt Don’ts
In This Chapter
 Avoiding problems with your debts
 Steering clear of mistakes that make your finances worse
W
hen you are worried about the amount of money you owe
to your creditors and confused about how to handle your
debts, it’s easy to do things that you later regret.
Although there are plenty of ways that you can trip up when you
are struggling to keep up with your debts, in this chapter we warn
you about the ten most common mistakes we’ve seen consumers
make. We hope that our warnings help you avoid some headaches
and hassles.
Ignoring Your Debts
When you feel overwhelmed by your debts, you may be tempted to
stuff bills and notices from your creditors in a drawer, and you
probably don’t return creditors’ calls. Bad idea!
Sweeping your debts under the rug just leads to higher bills
because interest and late fees keep coming. You end up at greater
risk for being sued by your creditors, having your car repossessed,
losing your home (or being evicted if you’re a renter), and having
your utilities shut off. So no matter how much it hurts, open those
bills, return your creditors’ calls, and put a plan in place for deal-
ing with your debts.
Falling Behind on Car Payments
If you don’t stay current on your car loan, you risk having your car
repossessed. As we explain in Chapter 11, repossession can
happen without any warning after just a single missed payment.
One day you have your car, and the next day you don’t. If you need

your vehicle to earn a living, losing it could spell disaster for your
finances. At the very least, it makes life more difficult for you and
your family.
Managing Money Without 
a Budget
It’s foolhardy to think that you can get out of debt without using a
written household budget to help you reduce your spending and
manage what you do with your money. No tool is more fundamen-
tal to managing your debts and to ensuring that your limited dol-
lars go toward paying your top priority debts and living expenses.
Review your written budget each pay period to make sure it con-
tinues to reflect the state of your finances and so you can decide if
you want to revise your budget — allocate more of your income to
savings, for example. If you haven’t already done so, be sure to
read Chapter 4.
Paying Creditors Just Because
They’re Aggressive
When money is tight and you don’t have enough to pay all your
debts, never make decisions about which ones you’ll pay based on
which creditors hound you the most. The ones that bother you the
most may be the creditors you should pay last.
Base your decisions instead on the consequences of not keeping up
with a particular debt. The bigger and badder the consequences,
the more important it is to pay the debt. For example, if you don’t
pay your mortgage, you could lose your home; if you fall behind on
your car loan, your vehicle will be repossessed; and if you don’t pay
your federal taxes or your child support, you’re at risk for a wide
range of possible consequences, none of them pleasant.
On the other hand, say that you don’t pay your credit card debts.
Yes, the credit card companies may eventually sue you to get the
court’s permission to garnish your wages, seize some of your
assets, and so on. But that process takes time — unlike a reposses-
sion, for example. And if your debts are not large, a credit card
company may decide to write off what you owe as bad debt.
Furthermore, you can use bankruptcy to get rid of credit card debt,
but filing for bankruptcy won’t erase your obligation to pay your
mortgage, car loan, federal taxes, or child support.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
278

Making Promises That 
You Can’t Keep
When a creditor contacts you about a past-due debt, or when you
contact the creditor to negotiate a way to catch up on past-due
payments and stay current on future payments, never agree to pay
more than you truly believe you can afford. Base your decision on
your household budget.
When you don’t have enough money in your checking account to
pay what you owe to a creditor, don’t give the creditor a postdated
check, gambling that by the time the date of the check arrives, the
money you need to cover it will be in your account. There is noth-
ing to stop the creditor from depositing the check before its date,
which could cause the check to bounce. If that happens, you have
to pay an insufficient funds fee to the bank, and you have to pay a
fee to the creditor as well. On top of that, if you can’t come up with
the money you need to make good on the check, you may be pros-
ecuted for passing a bad check.
If you over-promise and then begin having problems living up to
the agreement, you lose credibility. That makes it difficult (perhaps
impossible) to negotiate any additional concessions. Also, if you
default on the agreement you made with a creditor, you may find
that the full amount you owe — not just the past-due amount —
becomes due immediately.
Continuing To Use Credit Cards
It’s a no-brainer! If you’re having problems keeping up with your
credit card payments, don’t rack up more credit card debt. If you
can’t afford to pay for something with cash, don’t buy it.
Help yourself out by leaving your credit cards at home. For even
greater protection, put your credit cards in a plastic bag of water
and then place the bag in your freezer. If you’re tempted to use your
cards, by the time the ice has melted, you may think better of it.
Borrowing Against Your Home
When you’re having problems making ends meet, don’t put your
home on the line. You may be tempted to borrow against the equity
you’ve built up or to use your home as collateral to get another
Chapter 19: Ten Debt Don’ts 279

type of loan. Don’t. If you can’t afford to keep up with your loan pay-
ments, you could lose what is probably your most valuable asset.
Working with a For-Profit 
Credit Counseling Agency
Always work with a nonprofit credit counseling agency, not a for-
profit agency. A for-profit credit counseling agency is in business 
to make as much money as possible off your financial woes.
Therefore, you cannot trust that its recommendations are in your
best interest. Some for-profit agencies may tell you to do things
that make them money at your expense and that could get you into
legal hot water.
Getting a High-Risk Loan
Some for-profit credit counseling agencies try to loan you money,
claiming that the loan is a way out of your financial morass. Other
creditors, like finance companies, also claim that their loans will
help you deal with your debts. Always beware of loan offers that
are made by nontraditional lenders, especially offers that require
you to use as collateral your home, car, or some other asset that
you don’t want to lose.
Although loans from nontraditional lenders may sound tempting,
steer clear. If you read the loan paperwork carefully, you find that
the loans are a very expensive source of cash and that the terms
actually set you up to lose your collateral.
Asking a Friend or Relative 
to Cosign a Loan
If you cannot qualify for a loan from a traditional lender because of
the state of your finances, think twice before you ask a friend or
family member to help you get the loan by cosigning for it. If some-
one you know is the cosigner and then you fall behind on your loan
payments, the lender will look to your friend or family member for
the money you owe. Not only may paying your loan put your
cosigner in a financial bind; it may very well ruin your relationship.
