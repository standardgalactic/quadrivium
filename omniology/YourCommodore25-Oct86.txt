Spaced Out
AN UNHOLY ALLIANCE BETWEEN
Hewson and Llamasoft, has resulted in
the release of tridis Alpha billed as a
shoot-em-up with an intellectual twist.
John Gilby ship has to contend with
thousands o f  Licker Liners, Zebedee
Zonkers, Bubble Blasters and Cigger
Cruisers.
The intellectual bit occurs when you
progress to ﬁghting on two planets at the
same time. It's just been released and
costs E8,95 on cassette and 112.95 on
disk.
Still in Space, Gremlin has released
Project Nova for the C-16/Plus/4. It's a
space combat simulation in which you
have the opportunity to be a space pilot.
There are 12 stages through which to
progress, starting at novice and building
up t o  the much coveted legendary
status.
Star Trek has now been a cult TV
series for  20 years and the ofﬁcial
computer version will be launched in
late September by Beyond. Francis Lee
of Beyond said: "We are very proud to
be playing such an important part in this
major happening, and we have no doubt
that the Star Trek project will be the
most signiﬁcant licensing deal signed
this year."

Hard Lines
Euromax is set to expand its range ot
Arcade and arcade turbo joysticks with
three new models and a revised and
improved version of the Competition
Pro -  now to be called the Euromax
Micro Pro
According to Euromax, there is a
need for much better quality joysticks
due t o  the increase in  'fast action'
games. Euromax told Your Commodore
"We have taken the opportunity t o
advance designs to achieve the absolute
best in terms of accuracy, responsive-
ness, sensitivity and reliability".
The Elite (115.95) is now available as is

lot of criticism because of its diabolical
slowness. Firstline software has come to

owners with the Enhancer 2000 disk
drive. Claims for the Enhancer include:
Commodore compatability, super high
speed. one year warrantyalxceptional
durability, double density V ' ,  35 track.

Generally Speaking
If you're a bit short of cash and feel that
you need a new computer then maybe
Ariolasoft is about to come to your aid.
The Great Ariolasoft Spot the Screen
Shot Challenge has  recently been
launched.
Every Ariolasoft game which you buy
will contain a mystery screen shot and in
order to win a fantastic prize you must
name the game featured in the shot.
If you get your answer right then you
could win a  free game, a badge or
money-off tokens. From there your
entry will go into a prize draw (it's
eligible even if you guessed the wrong
game) a n d  t h e  grand pr iz e is  a
computer.
You can choose from either a C128, a
Spectrum 128, and Amstrad 6128 or an
Atari 130XE.
Anyone out there with a pirate cop‘
of Word Star, beware! The MicroPro
Word Star amnesty has now come to an
end after 750 disks had been returned
for legitimisation.
Robin Oliver, Micropro's MD said:
"Just for the record, I would like to
repeat what we said at the time of the
announcement of the amnesty, that we
will not prosecute any of those peoplc.
neither will we disclose their names to
anyone." He added: "The amnesty is
now over, and we will take a severe view
of software pirates that come to our
notice, since we feel that we have been
more than so far."
Still on the subject of crime, there's a
new home burglar alarm system which
may save y ou losing y ou precious
Commodore computer.
Autolarm, from Raceamble, is a new
home and commercial security system
which can be installed by the user with
the aid of just a screwdriver.
The Autolarm controller forms the
heart of the system, it has a powerful
internal siren (battery powered) and a
key switch with over 2000 different keys.
The controller can be used alone to
warn if your computer is unplugged or
the mains lead cut. The controller costs
E45 and a whole system can be bought
for less than £200.
Citizen Europe, makers of printers,
have been going round doing their bit
for education i n  this country. The
company recently donated 20 printers to
the local education authority for use in
schools in the Uxbridge area. Miora
Kizawa, MD of the company, the mayor
of Hillingdon recently attended a
ceremony t o  had over the printers,
accompanied by members of Greenway
Secondary School.

NEXT ISSUE, YOUR COMMODORE
will have a bright new look, A look that
will be more in tune with the country's
most discerning computer owners. Yes,
we mean you!
Over t h e  pas t m o n t h  o r  s o,
completed readers survey forms have
been ﬂooding into our ofﬁce. We're
very ﬂattered to ﬁnd that, by and large,
you think we've got it about right. Of
course there'll be a few minor adjust-
ments here and there, but you'll still ﬁnd
all your favourite features.
You'll also ﬁnd something else too!
Because next issue, to mark our sophist-
icated new look, we'll be giving away a
FREE cassette packed with software to
suit every taste, to run on a CEp4 (or C128
in C64 mode).
•
Firstly, there'll be an exclusive game
written by Tony Crowther, one of the
UK's top games writers. Called RI-D1,
the game puts you in control of a robot
droid which you have to try to guide out
of an enemy complex. Needless to say,
there are lots of enemy droids trying to
stop you from doing just that! As you'd
expect fr om a  Crowther game, the
action is fast and furious and the sound
track superb!
The second program is a Basic Exten-
sion_ Anyone who's programmed on the
C64 will have craved the sophisticated
toolkit commands as found on some
rival micros, You know what we mean:
RENUMBER, to help tidy up programs;
AUTO, to relieve you of the bind of
typing lin e  numbers yourself; and
TRACE, to help you ﬁnd out why your
latest masterpiece just crashed. The
Your Commodore Basic Extension will
have these and more - in fact no fewer
than 2 7  n e w  commands t o  mak e
program design and development so
much easier.
Finally, those of you with disk drives
should not be without the Your Com-
modore Disk Utility, It will give you a
wide range of powerful commands to
aid your disk usage. You will be able to
change Headers and IDs on all disks,
change t h e  LO AD address o f  any
programs, even protect your disk from
prying eyes, plus lots more.
So don't miss the November 1986
issue of Your Commodore. Cancel that
holiday, forget the new car picket your
newsagent instead!

FOR SO ME T IME THERE WAS A
deﬁnite gap i n  t h e ﬂow o f  new
adventure games for the C64. This error
on the part of those who control our
spare time entertainment seems to have
been rectiﬁed to such an extent that
there now appears to be almost a glut of
releases to attract our attention.
There have been several re-releases
of programs originally f o r other
computers and a fair number of brand
new titles from well known software
houses. Mastertronic has done it again
with the 64 version of an Old Spectrum
game called Kenaila -  at 11.99 this has
got to be worth buying. Bored of the
Rings from CRI was also a Spectrum
winner and has at last appeared for the
64.
Doomdark 's Revenge -  another
Spectrum chartbuster -  a  game of
adventure/strategy par excellence from
Beyond, looks all set to keep many a 64
user tied to the keyboard for weeks of
fantastic derring-do! Most of the better
games today appear as conversions for
several computers almost at the same
time and it is good to see that several
software houses a re  prepared t o
persevere w i t h  conversions o f
yesterday's winners.
New releases include Borrowed
Time from Activision, Pilgrim and The
Very Big Cave Adventure from CRL.
Mystery Voyage from Colleen -
newcomers to the adventure scene -the
fabulous Ultima IV from US Gold, and of
course level Nine's lastest, The Price of
Magik,
The Price is Right
Could this be Level Nine's best yet? The
Price of Magik is a sequel to Red Moon,
their award winning game of 1985. The
action nearly all takes place within the
conﬁnes of The House of the Red Moon
and the crux of the game is your search
to ﬁnd and defeat the evil sorcerer
Myglar.
There are no pure treasures to ﬁnd
and no score is given, although SCORE is
recognised and will elicit a report on
your present sanity and apparent age!
The aim of the game is to learn (and ﬁnd
a use for) some 18 odd spells that will
ﬁnally enable you t o neutralise the
powers of the wicked Myglar.
level Nine's last game was The Worm
in Paradise and this set a new standard
for adventures i n  this country. A
vocabulary of over 1000 words, a parser
that makes sense of complex sentences
and an operating system that permits the
typing in of  commands even whilst
pictures are being drawn on the screen
(multi-tasking).
The Price of Magik has all this and
more. It also incorporates RAM SAVE
and RAM RESTORE which enables the
player to rapidly 'save' and subsequently
'restore' the game position to/from a
section of the computer's memory. A
very useful facility if you anticipate a
dangerous move or decision ahead! The
RAM SAVEd position is lost when you
switch off the computer and is not
recorded if you perform a tape SAVE.
Another level Nine ﬁrst sees the light
of day in this program - the command
OOPS. This is not so dissimilar to RAM
SAVE as it enables you to return to your
last previous location. Very useful if
there are a number of chests to open
and some of them explode and reduce
yor stamina (hit points). OOPS and it
never happened!
Your stamina is fairly important, as
there are several unpleasant creatures
that will not let you past without a ﬁght.
A weapon and some form of armour are
useful ﬁnds before you get too involved!
Magik may also help and bear in mind
that simple killing i n  such a n
environment might release yo u r
opponent's ghosts - who may not be all
that friendly to you in the future?
Some creatures may be controlled by
you. Needless to say, Magik will be a
deﬁnite plus for this, learning to use
each of the 18 spells requires knowledge
of both the type name of the spell -ZAP,
FLY, HYP etc. and the object that will
enable you to 'focus' your powers to
perform that particular Magik. Clues
found along the way will supply the type
name and trying to CAST XXX will tell
you what else is needed to make that
spell work.
This is also the ﬁrst adventure game
to be protected against piracy by using
the Lensiok system. This requires a
plastic prismatic lens arrangement
(supplied with each game), that converts
what appears on the screen as a graphic
jumble into a readable two letter code.
This code is entered and if you have it
correct, then the program continues. If
not then you have to try again until you
get it right.
At least in 'The Price of Magik', you
get a second, third, fourth (and on)
chance to get the Lenslok code right.
Some programs using Lenslok NEW the
program if you do not get the code
right! Upper case characters seem to be
fairly easy to identify but I found that the
lower case characters ,
read. Just t a k e  care, read  t h e
instructions, get the lens the right way
up and all should be well.
This adventure is probably the best
yet from level Nine, the graphics are
drawn quickly and the text is up to the
usual high standard. The idea of ﬁnding
spells rather than a series of treasures is
clever and keeps the mind sharp
throughout. Although most of the clues
and necessary items to make the spells
work are perfectly logical, Level Nine's
own brand of humour is never far away.
Even if  you feel you are coping
reasonably well, never forget that Level
Nine will provide comprehensive clue
sheets o n  receipt o f  a  stamped
addressed envelope and t h e hint
request form that comes with every
game.
Runecaster casts a critical I
eye over the latest releases
on the adventure scene.
1

A d v e n t u r e
These clue sheets are by far and away
the best I have ever seen. They consist of
hundreds of numbered references of
which two sections are lists of objects
and places. Look up an object or place
and you will be directed to additional
numbered references that will provide a
hint to g e th e r w i t h  additional
references.
All the answers are jumbled up. so
that looking up one clue will not draw
your eyes to answers you do not wish to
see. Even if you want to cheat heavily,
the clues will only point you in the right
direction and NOT give you a deﬁnitive
answer to the entire game. Brilliant!
There are often a number of red
herrings within these clues. You may
spot a  Three Headed Minotaur
mentioned next to the Trumpet you are
looking up; but there is no guarantee
that such a creature is actually part of the
game! I  wish other software houses
could learn just how sensible such a
system of self help clue sheets can be.
The only sadness I feel in seeing a
new adventure from Level Nine is that
this means we have to wail at least three
or four months before we see the next
one!
Lost At Sea
Colleen is a relatively new software
house, based in Wales and not across the
Irish Sea as the name would lead you to
expect. Having produced an interesting
and instructive music disk for the C64
that includes a guitar iutor, SD chip
tutor, drum machine and a  music
creator, it is not surprising that the ﬁrst
adventure program from this company
features sound rather than graphics.
Mystery Voyage is available on both
tape and disk and is a three part
adventure requiring codes learnt in one
part to continue to the next. The ship in
which you are travelling founders in
rough seas leaving you alone on a
rickety raft admidst a number of small
islands. Can you survive long enough to
escape alive?
First you must ﬁnd a  series o f
treasures to appease a sea monster who
blocks your path to freedom. This is no
easy task, as to add to your troubles, you
have no food or drink, without which
you will surely perish.
The location desciptions are detailed
and set the scene well, with the
occasional sound effects adding to the
mind's impression of the places visited.
The puzzles are in the fairly classic
mould, with certain locations not
accessible until the right objects/actions
have been located/performed.
There are a number of clues that will
put you on the right path and the
puzzles, while not particularly difﬁcult,
must be solved in the right sequence o r
you will die of hunger or thirst. Mapping
is important and read the descriptions
carefully to distinguish the difference
between certain watery locations!
The command parser is of a simple
nature, generally reacting to a straight
verb/noun input. There is very little
interaction with the creatures you meet
although talking to some of them is
important. Examining objects is vital to
the game but only a few give much in the
way of additional information.
This may be a good game for novice
adventurers, as the lessons learnt here
will stand them in good stead when they
come to tackle a more devious plot in
the future. There are plenty of locations
to visit and map right from the start and
frequent use of the SAVE facility is to be
recommended -  preferably just after
you have been fed and watered!
The sound effects may be switched
off, which is probably a good thing.
After the ﬁrst few hearings they become
a nuisance, purely because they have
been programmed in direct mode and
you have to wait for them to ﬁnish
before you can type i n  any new
commands. Future programs from
Colleen will probably have these effects
in background mode using th e
interrupts, allowing a  multi tasking
similar to that used by Level Nine's
graphics.
It is good to see a new software house
producing adventure games and
although this one will not reach the top
of the charts, the game is sound (!) and
hopefully will be the ﬁrst of many.
Neo Classic
As we are often telling you, THE classic
adventure is that of the colossal caves
from way back then, written by Messrs
Crowther and Woods. There have been
a number of reincarnations of this game
for the C64. some better than others. We
now have yet another version, this time
from the fertile minds of St Brides and
distributed by CRL.
9
The Very Big Cave Adventure is
distinctly different.
Your guide and mentor around the
caves is none other than Trixie Trinian,
kitted out as usual in boater, blue
gymslip and black stockings. Judging by
the mud around, she is also wearing her
wellies! Anyone who has played one of
the serious versions just has to get this
one.
It i s  written using The Quill,
Illustrator and The Patch, all from Gilsoft
and shows just what sort of professional
products these adventure writing
utilities can create. The graphics are
good, appear quickly a n d  t h e
descriptions full and highly amusing.
the whole adventure is completely
recognisable as a  Colossal Caves
derivation but the entire game is full of
minor alterations that make it a joy to
play.
For those that have enjoyed these
caves before, there will b e  many
surprises! Trixie and her friends have
been there before you, and have altered
many of the puzzles - rotten little devils.
There are some of the original treasures
remaining but you may also ﬁnd such
gems as the odd Chippendale table to
pick up as well.
For those that are new to the caves
just lean back and enjoy a zany treasure
hunt with an amusing guide. The game is
well put together and has all the latest
add-ons that come with Gilsoft's Patch,
most useful of these is the RAM SAVE.
This is very rapid and will save using up
too much of your lamp's fuel whilst you
are trying to sort out how to catch that
dratted bird!
The program has a fast loader and
because of its size, the game is played in
two parts, but you must SAVE your
position either to tape or disk before
leaving the ﬁrst spot. This will ensure
that you have all the treasure arid any
vital objects you need to carry through
to the second part. The second part has
strong overtones o f  A l i c e  i n
Wonderland, complete with tardy,
chattering rabbit.
Throughout the adventure beware
of words that have a double meaning.
Where a word may be understood in
more than one way expect the least
likely interpretation. The vocabulary
understood in each half is not extensive
neither does the program understand
complex input commands. For all that,
there is a feeling of depth to the game
with plenty of items to examine and a
good range of responses.
One of the 'magic words' from the
original cave adventurers was PLUGH,
transporting you from one location to
another, Type this in here and you will
get a 'plug' for St Brides next game. I can
hardly wait!
Find The Lady
One type of now standard adventure is
based on the detective story. There have

been several published, ranging from
Infocom's D e a dline  thr ough
Melbourne Houses's Sherlock and in a
way including Activision's Mindshadow.
The latter just barely creeps in, although
in the strictest sense it is not quite a
detective game as the solution is quite
tightly deﬁned -  providing you have
solved the puzzles in the right order.
Activision has now released a top of
the range detective game - Borrowed
Time. This is a disk based program for
the C64/128 and if this genre is your kind
of thing - buy it. You play the part of
private eye Sam Harlow and initially you
do not know what problem you have to
solve! You start in your ofﬁce, just two
rooms; one for you and one for your girl
Friday, Iris Spencer.
There are plenty of hints suggesting
that someone is looking for you and a
very brief phone call where a voice gasps
out: "Sam, they want you dead...". You
must not only stay alive but ﬁnd out what
is the root of all these problems and
solve the mystery.
Borrowed Time is unusual in offering
the facility of either using they keyboard
in the usual way or a joystick. The screen
is divided into four parts. One, just over
a quarter, displays a  good graphic
picture at the present scene. Beneath
this is the text window, used for your
input commands and the computer's
responses,
On the right of the screen is a list of
verbs/nouns accessed by a pointer (with
the joystick) and above this, pictorial
icons of objects held, together with a
compass rose for joystick directions.
I found the use of  a  joystick
completely superﬂuous, as many of the
words I wished to enter were not on the
limited list displayed. It was also easier to
enter the single letter 'EP. to travel east,
than to position the pointer over the
correct part of the compass. Perhaps I'm
old fashioned and you will think
otherwise.
The graphics are very good, clear and
readily understood. Good use of sprites
give many of the screens the quality of
moving pictures washing blows on the
line, heads move in the crowd and faces
grimace under gags. They may be turned
off, but often show something that will
trigger an important action, so are best
left on!
The text often over-runs the text
window and RETURN has to be pressed
to display the rest of the message. For
this reason alone, I would rather have
access to thz entire message rather than
the option of limited joystick commands
(which takes up the additional space).
Starting in his ofﬁce, Sam Harlow can
look at his ﬁles about his last few cases
and generally explore his two rooms -
Iris is out at the moment. On leaving the
ofﬁce, he is attacked by two gunmen
and stands a very good chance of being
shot dead!
Fortunately the game starts again
very quickly and you can try again, there
is also a QUICKSAVE option that will
enable you to skip over the ﬁrst few
moves that you feel must be taken
before his hasty demise. His actions are
1
severely limited within the ﬁrst ﬁve
locations and perhaps I am just not cut
out to be a detective but it took me the
best part of two hours before I could
break the pattern of being killed within
only a few moves from the start!
In case y ou have the  same
experience, the answer to this problem
is MPDL WE EPPS at location number
ﬁve. This will give you time to do what I
was trying to do for the best part of those
two hours! Believe me, there are plenty
of further opportunities of getting killed
but at least you can have the chance to
wander around the city and learn
something before it happens!
The input command parser is quite
intelligent but for the most pan a
straight verb/noun input will be quite
sufﬁcient, with the program cleverly
interpreting what you have in mind and
acting very much as your co-pilot. Text
descriptions and responses are detailed
and explain a great deal as you proceed,
keeping the pressure going all the time.
There is the option for nine SAVE
GAME positions (accessible via function
key 1). use them. Mapping is also
important, as there is always the
possibility of sudden death around the
corner and you will not have time to
backtrack all that often to check your
psoition. Keep a notebook handy to
make notes of car/house numbers etc.
for the same reason.
Many of the people mentioned in
the case ﬁles in your ofﬁce will turn up
during your investigations - again, a few
notes will help refresh your memory. I'm
not sure whether it will be important,
but do remember that this is an
American program, so watch your
language! What we would call blinds,
they call shades; a cheque is a check and
so on. Most important objects are shown
in text on the screen so you can check
the spelling.
A fascinating type of adventure with
both good graphics and good text and
most important of all a riveting story
line. For all that I prefer my trusty sword
to Sam's ﬁnely crafted gun, this is some
program.
Exodus Plus
As you will have seen in our special
feature in the June issue. Ultima IV is n
ow available, certainly as an American
import at £49 but also should be out in its
British form fr om  U S Gold a t
considerably less. If you like wielding a
sword in fantastic lands with a quest to
keep you going for weeks - look it out,
its worth getting a disk drive specially to
play it!
Exodus: Ultima Ill has been out for
some time now and is well worth
searching for. I've even seen it on offer
for as little as £3.95 (bankrupt stock). If
you have had trouble solving this one,
you might try giving my friend 'Dart, the
mighty ﬁnder of marks and cards' a buzz
on 0442 832593. If he can remember that
far back pre Ultima IV-he may be able
to give you a useful tip or two!

Lionel Jack provides
a handy menu routine
for C64 owners.
You've all seen at some time
how pop-up menus can really
give programs a look of pro-
fessionalism. Well now you
can achieve the same affect in
your o w n  programs. This
utility allows the user to call a
number of pop-up menus of
his/her o w n  des ign t o
enhance their own screen
display which is returned to
its original state when the
menus are erased.
Machine Code
Although the work horse of
the program has been written
in M a c h i n e  C o d e  ( f o r
obvious speed) it has been
designed t o  b e  accessible
from Basic.
Before you can use the
program you must type in the
mac hine c o d e  l o a d e r
program. This program is not
too long and has an automatic
save facility at the end (tape
or disk) so that you are just
left with the source code for
quick, easy loading fr om
Basic.
Demonstration
Once the Machine Code is
saved you can type in the
small demonstration program
to see just what the program
is capable of. I his routine has
been written on a very simple
level just to give you an idea
of how everything works. The
number, size, c olour and
position of your own menus is
completely under your own
control. Refer to Figurel for a
complete breakdown of the
demonstration program.
You will ﬁnd a short delay
when you run the demo. This
is just the computer reading
the text into memory, this
means that the menus will
appear almost immediately
when c alled later i n  t h e
program.

Designing your own
menus
When designing your own
menus there are just ﬁve
parameters that y ou mus t
pass to the M/C to get the
size, colour etc. that y ou
require. If you examine the
demons tration pr ogr am
these parameters are:
I: The number of lines that
you want i n  y our  menu.
Always add two to the total
that you require to allow for a
border across the top and
bottom.
WI This is the width of the
menu. Again add two to your
total t o allow for a border
down the sides.
C: This is the colour of the
shadow o f  the menu. The
program w ill automatically

make the foreground of the
menu the next higher colour
in the Commodore colour
table. If you therefore choose
0 (black) a s  t h e  shadow
then the foreground will be 1
(white).
This indicates which menu
you wish to display. ril discuss
text later but for now all that
you need to know is that the
menu numbers correspond
to the order in which the text
appears i n  t h e  D A T E
statements (lines 500-570 in
the demo). In other words if
B=3 then you will get the third
block of text in the menu.
SA: This is the start position of
the top left hand corner of
the menu. It should be equal
to a screen memory location.
For your information location
1024 is at the top left hand
corner o f  the screen, you
should be able to work out
the rest from there.
Entering Text
The only other thing you
need to know is how to set up
your text. You may have as
much text as you like in each
of your menus, as long as it
will all ﬁt on the screen, but
care needs to be taken that it
appears exactly how you want
it to.

When writing your text as
DATA statements (see demo)
you might need to placeextra
spaces between words o r
even have words connected
(see line 570 in demo). This is
only to make sure that the
text is correctly spaced in the
menus. Plan y our  menus
carefully before you enter the
DATA statements and y ou
should have no problems.
You may have noticed that
the text data in the demo has
an asterisk (*) at the end of
each line. This merely an
indication to the computer
that this is the end of the text
for a particular menu. As my
demo is pretty short my text
for each menu has not gone
over o n e  line, b u t  as  I
suggested earlier your text
may be as long as you like and
may therefore require more

Make sure that you place an

STARTING
BASIC
Commodore

Sean Gray
Commodore 128. Starting Basic
Book 1
Sean Gray
Glentop
E5.95
This lively book forms an ideal companion
to the 128. The author has made a
determined attempt to break away from
the textbook style without getting too
light in his approach.
Gray approaches his subject from the
standpoint of a total beginner, playing
around with the keyboard ﬁrst of all and
rapidly meeting syntax errors. After this
introduction the book concentrates on
the Basic commands in a programming
environment. T his  means  t h a t  i t
introduces each set of commands within
/7
SPC/ﬂa
very short games programs explaining
their purpose and full syntax. Some
chapters set exercises to give you a chance
to see how much is sinking in.
All of the listings which incoroporate
graphic symbols use a special form of
notation, similar to the listings in this
magazine, a n d  t h e  meanings  a r e
explained i n  o n e  o f  t h e  book 's
appendices.
When t h e  graphics a n d  s ound
commands are introduced the book takes
time to explain the principles involved
with easy to understand diagrams. All the
time the author encourages you to stand
on your own two feet and not just to allow
yourself to be spoon fed.
This becomes apparent in the closing
chapters where Gray shows how to plan a
program. Each section of the program is
listed individually and dissected so that
each project is  fully  described and
justiﬁed.
For newcomers to computing via the
C128 this  b o o k  provides a  us eful
introduction and at just under £6 it offers
excellent value.
The Ofﬁcial Commodore 128
Personal Computer Book
Mitchell Waite, Robert [Afore,
Jerry Volpe
Sams (Macmillan)
$12.95
This is a very general book on the C128.
more of an expanded brochure than a
manual. Much of its time is spent talking
about the various modes and applications
of the 128. Apparently aimed at the ﬁrst
time user this is not a book for ﬁrst time
buyers. The text does go into graphics,
sprite and music commands but much of
its 200 pages ar e concerned w it h
describing the computer, its facilities and
general architecture.
In many places it is not an easy read,
14
relying more on verbal description rather
than examples but this problem is eased
slightly by the use of colourful diagrams
when applicable.
If you're getting the impression that I
disliked this book they you're wrong. I'm
just a little doubtful where its market
would lie. For the uninitiated it is a bit
heavy in places, for the technical buff it
has something to offer but once read
there is little to be gained by re-reading.
It is the sort of book which should be
given away with the computer. It falls
between the stools of being a book for
beginners and one for experienced users.
One useful section concentrates on the
CP/M operating system and its related
commands but another describes the
types of application software available.
Most o f  t he information c an b e
gleaned from various magazine articles
and at the price there are many better
bargains appearing on the market with a
meatier content.
Oxford Pascal on the Commodore
64
Ian Sinclair
Cassell Computing
E7.95
This is the ofﬁcial guide to the Pascal
compiler marketing by Oxford Computer
systems (Software) Ltd and deals with both
the cassette and t h e  extended disk
versions.
Ian Sinclair is a proliﬁc writer of books
on all aspects of computing and this shows

1
in the clear,concise style. Throughout the
book he lakes every opportunity to try to
sell the advantages ol Pascal over Basic
and a very convincing argument it makes.
Oxford Pascal is written speciﬁcally for
the features of the 64 which means that
extra comma nds are available for graphics
or sound and for incorporating machine
code routines within a program. Sinclair
covers all of these areas along with the
more usual commands in just enough
detail to set the reader on the path to the
structured programming which Pascal
demands. All keywords are highlighted in
bold capitals which makes browsing a
delight,
Example programs a r e  us ed t o
illustrate t h e  c or r ec t s y ntax  a n d
structuring and the author has kept them
short to allow the beginner to see what is
happening without hav ing t o  ty pe
furiously for an hour beforehand_
Where the tape and disk versions vary
a suitable note is made but sensibly the
majority of these commands are given a
chapter to themselves.
This book is very simple to follow and
written in  a style which is very easily
understood. A  recommended read for
anyone c ontemplating buy ing t h e
program.
ON THE
The Amiga Handbook
David Lawrence a n d  M a r k
England
Sunshine Books
£7.95
The whole publishing world seems to be
full of general books about computers or
computer systems. This book is a bit of an
exception purely because most people
are curious about the Amiga's new and
innovative range o f  capabilities. So
complex is the beast that after describing
the system overview, there is very little
room left in the book for programming
examples. After reading the book you end
up feeling that you've only shaken hands
with the machine rather than having
gained an intimate knowledge.
This book should prove invaluable to
anyone thinking of splashing out on the
new machine. It will also be a companion
in t h e  ﬁrst few months o f  use but
eventually it will outlive its usefulness as
the system becomes more familiar.
Gadgets, icons, the Blitter, Intuition
and all the other mysteries of the machine
are cleary explained in layman's terms.
The actual harnessing of  the Amiga's
power is not dealt with in great detail.
I found the description of the internal
chips of the Amiga a little offputting in its
position at the beginning of the book. A
more general introduction would have
given a less daunting approach to the
non-tec hnic ally  m i n d e d  r eader .
Although I  admit that the text makes
things crystal clear, I must also admit that
it is difﬁcult to cloud a shallow pool.
A recommended r ead f o r  those
contemplating a spending spree but an
Amiga owner would look for something
more meaty.
The Anatomy of the 1571 Disk
Drive
Rainer Ellinger
First Publishing
E12.95
0-948015-801
FIRST PUBLISHING REALLY HAS GOT
its act together when it comes to pub-
lishing detailed documentation o n
Commodore products. In this offering
over half of the book is given over to a
complete disassembly of the 1570/71
ROM and the rest of the book is a
detailed instruction manual.
The ﬁrst section of the book explains
about setting u p  t h e  drive an d
15
formatting diskettes. This is followed by
explanations of the simpler commands
in Basic 7_0_
Each c ommand des c ription i s
preceded by a clearly laid out table in
bold characters. Here the command is
shown in lour forms: the current 7.0
style, the abbreviation for it, the old style
command used before Basic 3.0 came
along, and the command as it used from
the Monitor. Beneath this table is an
explanation of the use of the command
and any points which are essential to the
user. Sensibly, this section carries the
essential warning about the save and
replace command whic h does n o t
appear to have been improved since the
old PET days. NEVER use (
Advanced disk commands are dealt
with in a similar no nonsense way. This
points out the senseless implementation
of the BACKUP command which has no
earthly use for 99.9•Y. of C128 users.
Sequential and relative ﬁles ar e
covered with varying degrees of success_
The section o n  sequential ﬁling is
excellent but relative ﬁles are dealt with
in a sketchy mariner, This is no real fault
with the book, it's just that the concept
of relative ﬁle creation is too complex to
be dealt with in theshort space available
within the book. Perhaps we can look
forward to a deﬁnitive work on the
subject in the near future_
The rest of the book is of interest to
advanced programmer's only_ The block
access commands are investigated in
sufﬁcient depth, allowing the adven-
turous programmer to try them out.
CP/M formats are described along with
the range of formats which the 1571 will
recognise.
The GCR coding used by the disk
system t o  store information is  fully
detailed, including how the sync marks
are used to tell the disk drive where it is
to start reading from.
For the price of this book you get a
wealth of knowledge which is a must to
the serious programmer and a sound
investment for a novice who wishes to
scale the heights o f  professionalism.
Much of the ROM disassembly is of no
real use to the majority of programmers
but holds a strange fascination for buffs
such as myself.
I hate books which purport to being
the only book you'll ever need' and this
book lays no such claim. In this case I
feel moved to make the claim for them:
for the majority of users this is THE
deﬁnitive work_
Children at Risk
David Porter
Kingsway Publications
E4.95
0-86065-374-9
DAVID PORTER HAS BEEN INVOLVED
with computers for many years but his
main concern at the moment is the
welfare of children in today's high tech
world.

B o o k  R e v i e w s
Children at Risk looks at all the
pressures to which a child is subjected
and the areas of Porter's concern seem
principally to be media related. Apart
from the ﬁnal chapters on child abuse
and drug addiction, the book concerns
itself with video and ﬁlm, role-playing
games, comics and computers.
From the outset Porter makes the
reader aware of his Christian beliefs
which will alienate potential readers
who are agnostics or  atheists. Does
Porter think that Christians care more
about t h e ir  c hildr en t h a n  n o n -
Christians? I hope not, but why limit the
audience by  indirectly insulting the
Moslems, Sikhs, Jews and various other
concerned groups by giving the book
such a heavily religious slant?
Part of the answer to this criticism is
that the book is published by a staunchly
Christian publishing house. Personally, I
feel this is a pity because such views
undoubtedly deserve a wider airing.
Very little attention has been drawn
to the harm which computer games may
be having on today's child and the
question which must be posed is how
divorced from reality are games?
The elimination of wave after wave of
aliens is not Porter's concern, no doubt
he played war games or cowboys and
indiaos in his own childhood and still
grew up to be a well adjusted adult. He
sees part of the threat in Adventure
games which delve into the depths of
satanism a n d  Black Magic . M o r e
importantly, in my opinion, he names
the main evils as piracy and hacking.
Piracy is the bane of the computer
industry and yet no effective legislation
exists to prevent schoolchildren up and
down the country from breaking the law
each day. Porter implies that this puts
the child on the wrong tracks and who
knows where this may lead?
Many cases o f  c hildren being
accused and convicted of breaking into
personal ﬁles and private systems via
modem-linked hacking have been given
news coverage lately. Surely this is akin
to breaking and entering?
Porter h a s  g o t  m a n y  s tr ong
arguments t o  p u t  forward i n  each
section of the book but I'm still left with
the feeling t h a t  t h e  author sees
bogeymen lurking in everything new,
hiding behind the beneﬁts. In aligning
himself with Mary Whitehouse he sets
up his stall from the dedication page, by
the middle of the book I was suffering
from Bible-bashing fatigue but by the
end I was more thoughtful.
Porter is  a  persuasive man who
deserves a n  audienc e b u t ,  l i k e
medicine, it may leave a bad taste in your
mouth.
Interestingly, t h e  book  is  being
promoted by Dave Carlos of Solutions
PR company. Is this a penance for being
involved with Domark's Friday the 13th
promotion which used a sickeningly
gory mask in  its banned advertising
campaign?
Getting The Most From Your
Printer
W Penfold
Bernard Babani
E2.35

TO ENCAPSULATE ALL YOU WANT TO
know about a printer in a mere 84 pages
is a challenge, to say the least. When this
involves all t h e  popular makes o f
computer, the task appears impossible.
Undaunted by the problems, Penfold
takes a brave stab at the subject and
almost succeeds.
The author's main concession is to
limit the text to the use of Epson dot
matrix printers. I t  would have been
better to mention this fact on the back of
the book for those who have printers
which are not Epson compatible.
Compared to most of the material
available o n  t h is  subject (almost
exclusively manufacturers' manuals),
this is a useful guide to some of the most
desirable facilities which these printers
provide.
Although the book  waxes lyrical
about the various typefaces, pitches,
underlining, spacings, tab settings and
the like, it omits to mention the thorny
subject o f  user deﬁned characters.
Penfold's obvious aim is to stick to the
normal printing functions of a matrix
machine and this is borne out by the
section on wordprocessors.
The commands used are written in
various Basics: Commodore, MSX,
Spectrum, Q L ,  Ac or n,  Ams tr ad,
Memotech and the ill-fated Enterprise.
If the book was thicker or if the range of
machines more limited, there would
have been room to include much more
information. St ill w e  mus t a llo w
publishers plenty of room to make their
proﬁts.
What we are left with is a very useful
guide f o r  newcomers t o  Eps on
compatibles or for those users who rely
on an interface t o  control straight-
forward printing and leave the clever
stuff to the big boys.

IF COMMS SOUND LIKE THE THINGS
your grandfather wore i n  the c old
weather, or if baud rate suggests the
speed at which ennui sets it  when
watching yet another tedious Australian
'soap', then I strongly recommend this
thin volume to you.
All o f  the buzzwords are here:
modems, stop bits, parity and duplex. As
each word is encountered a full explana-
tion is given which reveals the subject as
a simple core shrouded in thick veils of
jargon.
16
Penfold does not stop here, the book
also delves into what you can (politely)
do with your modem and stretches the
subject in t o  direct communication
between computers and radio com-
munications.
The section on direction connection
(local networks) is especially interesting
to Commodore owners because the
mystery of the non-standard RS-232 (the
user port) is explained at length. Later in
the book some simple program listings
are given for  direct communications
between Vic 20s and C64s.
For a mere E3 all this is remarkable
value.
Handbook o f
Commodore's
Simons' Basic
Jane G Reh
Brady Communications Co. Inc.
(Prentice Hall Publishing Co.)
£11.25
EVERY COMMODORE OWNER HAS
heard of Simons' Basic (S.13.). If you have
never become acquainted with S,B. then
this is the book for you. Indeed, even if
you are conversant with S.B., you may
yet ﬁnd some surprises here.
Jane Reh has  compiled a  very
comprehensive survey o f  S.B. which
clariﬁes t h e  original manual v ery
efﬁciently. I t  would be hard t o get
frustrated w it h  t h is  b o o k  as  a ll
commands are well deﬁned in some 22
different sections, which cover almost
everything y ou need t o  know. I n
addition there are plenty of sub-sections
and a  ﬁne collection o f  illustrative
programs. So if you really want to get to
grips with S.B., this is the book for you.
David Simons has had the good sense
to 'extend' his programs and offers some
streamlined ideas for you to try out. An
interesting chapter on new methods of
Data Handling is introduced involving
'local' and 'global' variables, while
structured Programming gives four new
commands: PROC, END PROC, CALL,
EXEC. T hes e c ommands  s implify
programming tasks and could lead you
into business programming in a modest
way -  A 'touch of Pascal' to quote the
author. Perhaps so, but you will have to
work on this one yourself to make full
use of the commands.
Naturally everyone's concept of S.B.
is as a graphics program. This is fully
clariﬁed here and the creation and use
of sprites is happily dealt with -  ideas
aplenty here.
Sound and Music are adequately
covered and the read functions for
Joystick, Paddle and Lightpen discussed.
The author does not seem too happy
with these - quite rightly tool!
I am happy t o note that, in  his
foreword, David Simons gives full credit
to Jane Reh for the compilation of the
book. Good luck to both of them and to
you when you use it as it is an enjoyable,
well presented, well documented book
which is good value for money. E . M .

karate chop a lump of wood.
You hav e 2 0  seconds t o
hammer the keys and reach a
sufﬁcient power level. This
element of the game is far too
easy a n d  i t  i s  a lm o s t
impossible n o t  t o  qualify.
Then some kind soul throws
shurikens a t  y ou. These
pointed stars, aimed high,
medium or low and coming at
you at a variety of speeds must
be deﬂected with your trusty
sword.
The graphics, although
large and colourful are fairly
crude and are accompanied
by various far eastern grunts.
The game though has n o
lasting appeal,and even at the
budget pr ic e, c annot b e
recommended.

THIS TITLE COULD JUST AS
well b e  c alled Y e  O ld e
Summery Gaymes. Eig h t
medieval combats for you to
try. Six against an adversary
(either human or computer)
and t w o  dexterity based
archery contests.
The object of the game is
very much to knock lumps
ouit of your opponent before
he does likewise to you. Each
player starts with 10 shields
and each shield consists of 10
roses, A  successful hac k
removes a  rose from your
adversary's total and t h e
game ends  w hen eit her
player runs out of shields or
time r uns  o u t  -  nic ely
depicted b y  wax dripping
from a candle.
The combat sports are two
sword ﬁghts, quarterstaff,
pikestaff, a battle axe and -
my favourite -  the ball and
chain -  a sort of conkers for
grown ups! For each event,
you have four aggressive and
four defensive manoeuvres
available t o you as well as
moving left arid right. You can
also tr y  shooting wooden
horses with the long bow and
moving targets with the cross
bow.
The whole game is very
nicely animated with some
excellent backdrops and
some appropriate mus ic
although I preferred to turn
this off and listen tothe sound
of weapon against bone. The
game is on a multi load tape
and f o r  onc e, I  had n o
problems with it whatsoever.
A highly enjoyable game to
play w i t h  t h e  a d d e d
advantage of being very well
presented. G.R.H.

ARAC IS A DROID AND AS
such has only a limited range
of actions. He can move left
and right, jump and ﬁre a net.
But, if he can ﬁnd two extra
legs and the power globe, he
can transform into Arach-
nidroid with the ability to fall
upwards and ﬁr e energy
bolts.
Only in that form can he
hope to deactivate the three
reactors. Even then, he might
need a little help from his
friends.
Assorted creatures inhabit
the complex and by ﬁring his

can capture them. These

Startrek. If this means nothing
to y ou then this game is
modelled o n  o n e  o f  t h e
golden o l d i e s  o f  t h e
computer world.
The galaxy has  been
attacked by an alien force and
they have already taken over
many sectors of your space
map. By hyperspacing to their
locations y ou must defeat
them all in battle and free the
galaxy.
To help you, you have two
laser cannon and a tristate set
of shields green, amber and
red, Green is a defenceless
state, enter combat in this
state y ou won't last long.
Amber is suitable for a single
opponent but r ed will b e
needed for serious battle.
Using y o u r  on- boar d
computer y ou are given a
display showing the galaxy
grip map which indicates the
number o f  ships i n  each
sector. Selecting a destination
using t w o  inter s ec ting
coloured bars you zoom off
through a  tremendous ly
effective 3D space warp to
face the foe.
As you do battle damage
occurs and you have to repair
your ship quickly or run for it.
Everything y o u  d o  takes
energy a n d  t his  c an b e
repleated b y  resting i n  a
cleared zone or  by  hyper-
spacing to an energy square
on the map.
As you gradually mop up
the empire your command
rating goes  u p  towards
Legendary, the highest status
in the universe.
Gremlin really seems to
have come to terms with the
C-16, the action seeming very
realistic indeed. Excitement
and a little planning make this
an excellent game.

AMBITIOUS BUT SUCCESS-
ful is the way I'd describe this
boxing simulation. Personally
I'm not a fan of the pugilistic
pastime b u t  a  c omputer
version is  bloodless a n d
bruiseless so it's OK by me.
The graphics are really
outstanding with the view of
the r ing showing Bruno's
back a s  h e  fac es  h i s

feints ar e c ontr olled b y

are not re-deﬁnable so hard
luck if you don't like them.
This method o f  control is
complex a n d  c ould hav e
been s impliﬁed i f  t h e
function keys had been used.
Bruno' s opponents are
loaded individually from tape
but you must beat each one to
progress to the next. This is
because there is  an entry
code awarded but once you
know the code you can skip
the defeated contenders in

characteristic style and you
must beat them a t  Light,

the next ﬁghter. Each ﬁght
lasts three minutes and you
must knock the other guy
down three times to win.
The screen display shows
the opponents cartoon faces

ask because the backdrop
seems to cause more attribute
problems than its worth. For
most of the game poor jack
seems to be ﬂying about with
a box around him. Although
the S p h i n x  w i t h  h e r
inscrutible smile does make
an interes ting scene, i t
detracts from the quality of
the gameplay.
Around the sphinx screen
are a number of ledges with
bombs resting on them. The
upper ledges are patrolled by
little men and a giant bird,
insect o r  something ﬂies
between the ledges in pursuit
of lack.
The little men gradually
get tired o f  patrolling the
same old ledge and drop to
progressively lower  ledges
until they reach the bottom of
the screen. Here they mutate
into large black balls which
ﬂoat ar ound t h e  screen
adding to Jack's problems.
Bonus disks are supposed
to appear but I've yet to see
any.
This game c ould hav e
been the best C16 game on
the market but the confused

A STRANGE LITTLE PLAT-

two o r  m o r e  associated

problem. You have very little

supposed t o  b e  d o in g .
Frequently, large areas of the
screen appear blank and you
must leap into the unknown
hoping that a platform will
miraculously appear under-
neath you. There are ropes to
be climbed, platforms that
collapse u n d e r  y o u  a n d
assorted nas ties  t o  b e
avoided. Everything that you
do though must b e done
quickly. Platforms under you
quickly burst into ﬂames and
there is also a time limit on
most screens.
Hercules needs a lot of
experimentation if you are to
get anywhere and this seems
to put a lot of people off the
game. Certainly, a straw poll
in the ofﬁce resulted in a
50/50 split of those who loved

REMEMBER MERCENARY?
If you don't then rush out and
but it immediately SO that you
can try the Second City. If you
do dash out and buy this data
disk.
Back a lr e a d y ?  O K .
Mercenary is Novagen's tour
de force. In the ﬁrst game you
had crash landed i n  t h e
middle of a civil war on the
planet Targ but the Palyars
and Mechanoids ar e s till
going at it hammer and tongs.
Again y ou must decide
whose side your on but your
decision is  totally arbitrary
because all your interested in
is the cash which will buy you
your escape_
In Mercenary you were
battling above and below
Central City but now you ﬁnd
yourself in the deep south in
the grip of a long, long winter.
The Palvar Commander's
brother-in-law is the prison
governor here and he has his
beady eye on you from the
start.
As in the ﬁrst game you
have to buy your ﬁrst ship on
the planet. Although t h e
price is still the same, other
commodities a r e  m o r e
expensive than they used to
be.
The graphics in this game
is up to the high standard of
Mercenary. For those who
haven't seen it, Targ is shown
in wire frame 3D style, like
Elite. U n l i k e  Elit e ,  • t h e
graphics move very quickly as
you skim the planet's surface
in your search for an elevator.
Along the way you can marvel
at the architectural delights of
Targ, created by Walton, the
planet's greatest architect.
Philistines with itchy trigger
ﬁngers can ﬁre a volley or two
at some of these buildings but
be warned, t h e  Targian's
won't take such disrespect
lying down.
The 3 D  effec ts  a r e
tremendous and y our  not
limited t o  merely skipping
along the ground. If you turn
upwards to 90 degrees your
ship will zoom heavenward
where you can stop and look
back to see the city. There, far
below, you can see the streets
laid out in a grid which you
can draw before zooming
back down to the surface for a
soft landing
When you bought your
ship, t h e  Palyars s ent a
message stating the location
of o n e  o f  their lifts. O n
reaching the correct place
you may descend into the
subterranean city.
Your next task is to ﬁnd
the brieﬁng room which is an
easier task than in Centraal
City, b u t  ﬁnding us eful
objects i s  har der . T h e
Mechanoids brieﬁng room is
around here as well so you
can easily decide who's side
you're on.
Access to the Mechanoid's
hideout i s  n o t  easy. T he
brieﬁng room only has those
strange tr iangular  d o o r s
which, we are told, lead to the
author's cheat rooms. These
are locked and only he has
the key.
The game now follows a
maze g a m e  patter n b u t
beware, t h e  d ir t y  tric k s
brigade have set traps. One
which I  found very quickly
was t h e  entrance t o  t h e
prison. This is a total dead
end_ When you turn around
after entering the door has
disappeared and t h e  only
option appears to be quitting
from the game., or is it?
Quitting does not mean
ending the game, as you may
think. You reappear on the
planets surface in a vehicle
but without arty of the useful
objects which you may have
picked u p  underground.
Once more you have to ﬁnd
the lift. What do you mean,
y ou'v e f o r g o t t e n  t h e
location? Nothing left but to
systematically search f o r
another lift.
Second City is for those
who really enjoyed the ﬁrst
game. I t  i s  n o t  s o  very
different i n  s ty le t o  it s
predecessor. The wire framed
buildings are still the same
and t h e  markings o n  t he
doors have not changed in
meaning. I t  is , however,
much harder to succeed.
Some humorous touches
take the form of billboards.
One with the Commodore
logo, another with the Atari
logo and a  third with the
name of one of the author's
previous creations. Hitting
the CBM logo gives the same
'traitor' response as before
and blasting the Atari sign will
bring congratulations. Don't
go for the third sign though,it
-will bring the author's curse
down ar ound y o u r  ears.
Things are going to get harder
is the threat.. so be warned.

GENERAL K N O W L E D G E
games are enjoying a great
deal o f  interes t a t  t h e
moment, thanks to the way
Trivial Pursuit has grabbed
popular attention. M i n d
Pursuit bases its style on the
original concept of categorised
questions but translates the
board game into a suitable
form f o r  t h e  c omputer
medium.
The board is replaced by a
snaking pathway of stepping
stones whic h eac h player
must n e g o t ia t e .  E a c h
correctly answered question
allows you to move on a step
or t w o depending o n  the
difﬁculty level and at several
points y ou ar e given t h e
opportunity to choose a short
cut of difﬁcult questions or
continue on your way with
softer options.
The point values of the
squares are 25, 50 and 100. For
25 points you simply have to
say if a statement is true or
false. Fifty points are awarded
if y ou answer a  question
correctly from a menu of four
optional responses. To gain
100 points you have to type in
your o w n  answer t o  a
question_
The high scoring option
has a pitfall. Even though it
allows you to omit a letter to
get one letter wrong, the
answer still has to be substan-
tially the same as the one
given. F or  example, 'boy
scouts' is a correct response
to a  question but 'scouts'
would be deemed incorrect.
Although some of my fellow
players moaned lik e crazy
about this, I thought it was a
valud attitude. In my time I've
played agains t ques tion
masters who have applied the
same rule in the board game.
After Monster Trivia I was
set to complain bitterly about
the American bias o f  the
questions but not now. The
sport questions a r e  v er y
American b u t  if  these are
treated a s  'stinkers' t h e
majority o f  t h e  o t h e r
questions are fair enough.
Only o n e  question really
annoyed me and that was 'In
the popular nursery rhyme,
who chased the weasel?' (no
the answer isn't 'pop').
I don't know if there are
plans t o  r eleas e e x t r a
question databases for  the
game but I hope so. There is
no facility for  building u p
your own questions and 1
found that many  o f  t h e
questions w e r e  repeated
during a second playing of
the game. On two occasions
in a game the same question
occurred twice.
Some of the questions use
graphics or music which is a
good example of using the
computer's capabilities to the
full.
Each player in turn presses
a k ey  t o  stop a  running
number generator. The value
given selects the area o n
which the question will be
asked. The six categories are:
sports and games, science and
nature, history a n d  geo-
graphy, T V  a n d  ﬁlm  o r
culture. Throwing a six gives
you a  general knowledge

gives you the chance of an
extra turn if  you answer it
correctly.
The game is only available
on disk and each side of the
disk has questions ranging
from simple t o  extremely
difﬁcult. A limit can be set on
the response time, a score
limit can be set or an overall
time limit. The adds variety to
the game, it's just a pity that
the response time can't be set
for indiv idual players t o
handicap t h o s e  ir r itating
know ails that I always seem to
be pitted against!
At the end of each game a
scoreboard i s  pres ented
which shows the percentage
of correct responses given by
each player. In the case of a
drawn game this can be used
to determine the victor. Apart
from this, it is interesting to
see h o w  y o u r  ov er all
performance measures and
means that a one player game
can be just as much fun as the
full four player game.
There appears t o  b e  a
slight pr oblem w i t h  t h e
screen d i s p l a y  w h i c h
probably results fr om t h e
difference between British
and American mains supplies.
The screen is split using an
interrupt a n d  t h e  l i n e
between the board and the
question area ﬂickers a row of
characters in  an extremely
irritating way.
The problems of syntacti-
cally correct answers is offset
slightly by a comprehensive
guide in the instructions. As a
result Scottish, Welsh and
Norhern Irish players w ill
probably t ur n u p  o n  U S
Gold's doorstep with murder
on their mind when they read
that the correct response to a
question whose answer is
Great Britain should be typed
in as England!
A good game but I'm still
waiting for the perfect Trivia.

C64 + joystick
HOT WHEELS IS BASED ON
Mattel's toy cars of the same
name and is aimed at the
littlies, I t  represents a new
concept c alled Computer
Activity Toys imported by US
G old f r o m  A m e r i c a ' s
excellent Epy x  c ompany
(Summer Games, Impossible
Mission, etc),
To say that this isa brilliant
game would be like saying
that the Sun is a newspaper.
The programming standard is
as high as  usual but t he
gameplay which results from
all this effort does not go far
enough.
Al the start of the game
you have to select your car
from the showroom or build
it yourself in the factory. The
showroom cars resemble the
Hot Wheels range but the DIY
cars are created by selecting a
front, middle and rear section
from the range available in
the workshops.
In both cases the overall
colour of the car has to be
selected in the paint shop.
The car is then sprayed with
clouds of colour and the car is
ready for the road.
Next y ou ﬁnd yourself
outside the c ar salesroom
waiting to hit the road. As you
travel ar ound ther e ar e
several options for  you t o
choose from: you can go for a
carwash o r  p a r k  i n  a
multistorey c arpark a n d
change your car again. The
only really interesting part is
the d e m o l i t i o n  d e r b y
stadium. After the fuss about
choosing a car colour I was
disappointed to ﬁnd that the
demolition car is always red.
The action is seen in plan
view w it h  t h e  f o u r  cars
represented b y  c oloured
blocks. As the cars bump into
one a n o t h e r  gr adually
become mis-shapen u n t il
they turn into grey wrecks. At
any point you can leave the
stadium and return to normal
life in your old car.
With nothing much to do
in this part of town, you'll
soon b e  itching t o  whizz
along the expressway and
investigate the other part of
town. This tr ip is done in
automatic gear. I n  other
words you sit and watch as the
car does  it s  o w n  thing,
eventually reaching the other
location (why's the car on the
wrong s ide o f  t h e  road,
daddy?).
In this part of town you
can t o p  u p  y our  petrol,
change oil,tune the engine or
swap your car for a shiny, red
ﬁre engine. These activities
provide a bit of fun to the
game especially catching the
dripping oil which seems to
drain from all over the car
body.
More c ould have been
made of this section. Why is
the price of the petrol shown
but not used as part of the
game? Surely it  would be
more fun to earn money at
the demolition derby and
spend it on the services in this
part of town? Running out of
petrol a n d  badly  running
engines could have made this
much more entertaining and
would give greater purpose
to the game.
On the good side, tuning
the engine and operating the
ﬁre engine takes a  bit o f
thought.
To tune each piston you
have to use your eyes and
ears. T he performance o f
each piston in  turn is  re-
presented by a sine wave and
a sound. An ideal curve and
sound is given as a reference
and the idea is to match the
current piston's performance
to this. After each piston is set
the t w o  waveforms a r e
compared and success gives a
green light display.
One of the houses has a
habit of bursting into ﬂames
and the race is on to collect
the ﬁre engine and dowse the
ﬂames before t h e  hous e
burns down. Changing from
your c ur r ent c a r  means
parking it in the ﬁre station
garage with its up and over
doors. Then the ﬁre engine
can emerge from its garage
and d a s h  o f f  t o  t h e
conﬂagration.
On arrival at the ﬁre, the
water tank is shown and the
idea is to dowse the ﬂames in
each w indow  befor e t h e
water runs out. Fail in your
task and the house burns
down before your very eyes.
This could have been a
superb entertainment if just a
little more thought had been
put into it. As it  stands it
provides short lived entertain-
ment and I was left with the
feeling that playing with the
actual t o y s  w o u ld  h a v e
greater appeal t o  m o s t
children.

assume that this tool too will ﬁnd a place
in the home, and if so, what will people
use it for? Cal-Kit from Ariolasoft aims to
be useful to home users and-there are
some 20 initial ideas as to how it might
prove helpful.
A spreadsheet is really no more than
a very large sheet of paper divided up
into rows and columns. It allows you to
make calculations on a given set of
ﬁgures, for example your household
expenses, and then re-calculate things
quickly and simply without the need to
rewrite the whole thing if, say, the
mortgage rate changes. It can be used
for nothing grander than checking your
bank balance or working out how many
rolls of wallpaper you need to decorate
the lounge or , o n  a  higher level,
managing y our  company's ﬁnances.
One term often associated with spread-
sheets is "what if?" This is because it is
easy t o work out problems such as
"What if I increase the price by 10% but
lose 3% of my sales as a result?".
One of the worst things about using a
program like this is if you load it in and
are presented with a series of rows and
columns and you have absolutely no
idea what to do next. It is here that Cal-
Kit comes into its own. Not only do you
get an easy to follow tutorial in the
instruction manual, but you also get 20
previously designed forms, all of which
come in  two formats. The ﬁrst has
sample ﬁgures already loaded in to show
you the sort of results to expect and the
second is left blank for you to use your
own ﬁgures. If the design of the form is
not quite to your liking, the tutorial
shows you how you can easily change it.
For example, you might not have a car
and so have no use for a row giving
details of motor expenses but prefer to
substitute it for itemising your children's
school fees.
It is these templates that make the
package easy to use and I for one would
not have bothered setting up my own
sheets i f  I  had nothing t o  g o  on.
Amongst the templates included are:-
home budget, metr ic  conversion,
starting a business and calculating loan
repayments.
So how does it all work? As I have
mentioned, the sheet is divided up into a
series of rows and columns. In Cal-Kit,
the maximum size of the sheet is 26
columns (A-Z) by  99 rows (1-99). By
referring to its co-ordinates, you can
easily address any particular cell e.g. C34
or K4 etc. The content of each cell can be
text, numeric or formula. An example
taken from the home budget template
will show how it all ﬁts together.
In the ﬁrst column, you write down
details of the varioius items of income
and expenditure-salary, rent, travel etc.
These are all text cells as are the labels
for the text 12 columns -  January,
February etc. In the appropriate cell,
24
you enter the relevant amount. For
example, if cell B2 represents salary for
January and you earned 1500, you enter
500 in cell B2, This would be a numerical
cell. If all your outgoings for January
were in cells B20 through to B30 and you
wanted to know your total expenses,
you get the program to total cells B20 to
B30 and to put the result in B32. This is an
example of a formula cell. Having input
all your ﬁgures, you can quickly get
answers for your nett income or see how
much you are spending on beer on a
month by month breakdown.
The program itself is very easy to use.
A help screen is always available if you
need it and there are several facilities
designed to make life as simple for you
as possible. A  typical example is the
replicate command. Say you have just
entered a formula to add up all the
expenses for January and want to do the
same for the rest of the year, a simple
command allows y ou t o  copy t h e
formula across without having to write it
out a dozen times. Sheets can be loaded
from and saved to disk and be printed
out if  required. If you use Paperclip
word processor, you can integrate the
sheet into a report or a begging letter to
your bank manager,
The acid question is, I  suppose,
would I use it myself and the answer is
probably yes. T he hesitancy is  not
through any fault of the program.. I
would r ec ommend t h a t  w it h o u t
hesitation to anyone who has a lot of
ﬁgurework problems. It is just that I can't
come to terms with the fact that my days
are numbered!

Allen Webb gives
kernal routines and
ﬂoating points the
once over.
BEFORE STARTING WORK
this month, I want to plug two
books which are invaluable to
the machine code user. Both
are b y  N ic k  Hampshire,
Richard Franklin and Carl
Graham:
1) The Commodore 64 ROMs
Revealed: T his  is  a  fully
annoted source code of the
ROM contents and is the best
I've seen.
2) Advanced Commodore 64
Basic: This gives an in-depth
description of the functioning
of Basic with a particularly
good chapter o n  ﬂoating
point operations.
From now on, as a matter
of convention, I will signify
the registers holding a 16 bit
address as  ( low byte/high
byte). F o r  ex ample, t h e
routine at SABlE which prints
a string requires the start
address in the accumulator
(low byte) and i n  t h e  Y
register (high byte). I n my
short hand,this is represented
by (A/Yl. OK?
Kemal Routines
You may frequently want to
LOAD or SAVE data to disk or
cassette. There are kernal
routines to handle both of
these. Before SAVEing o r
LOADing, there are two other
reoutines necessary to set up
the ﬁle details. These are
SETLES and SETNAM.
SETLFS
1
This routine, c alled f r o m
$FFBA, sets up a logical ﬁle. It
is called w ith t h e  device
number in the X register, the
logical ﬁle number in  the
ac c umulator  a n d  t h e
secondary address in the Y
register.
SETNAM
This routine sets up the name
of the ﬁle. It is called at $FFBD
with the start address of the
name in the X and Y registers
and the length of the name in
the accumulator. If you don't
want to give the ﬁle a name,
set the accumulator to zero
before calling the routine.
W E L C O M E  T O  T H E
These routines must be
called before calling the SAVE
or LOAD routines.
Load
This routine is called from
SFFID5. The accumulator is set
to zero if you want to make a
load of 1 if you want to verify a
ﬁle. I f  y ou have set t he
secondary address t o  zero
when you called SETIFS, you
must supply the load address
in the (X/Y) registers. If the
secondary address was one,
the ﬁle loads to the address in
its header.
Try these routines out,
they work as they are with
both disk and cassette.
As I will show later, it is
possible to set up ﬁles in a
neater way by use of routines
in the Basic ROM.
Although the kernal has
some handy routines, it is the
Basic ROM which is the real
mine o f  handy  bits  and
pieces. Before I launch into
this ROM, however, I must
bend your minds with a little
theory on the use of ﬂoating
point.
Floating Point
Floating point representation
is a complex system so I will
only touch on the subject.
We have already used eight
and 16 bit integar numbers.
The problem is, how do we
represent decimals? T h e
answer is in ﬁve or six bytes!
When ﬂoating point numbers
are being manipulated, the
six byte unpacked system is
used. When a  number is
being saved in RAM, a more
efﬁcient ﬁv e by te packed
format is used. The number is
represented b y  four  bytes
which make up the mantissa.
In packed format, bit seven of
the most signiﬁcant mantissa
byte holds the sign bit. In
unpacked format, the sign is
kept in the extra byte_ The
ﬁnal byte holds the exponent.
The exponent decides the
position of the decimal point.
6
Listing 1 shows a complete
LOAD routine. The routine
assumes that the device is
stored in location DEV, the
ﬁlename is stored in  RAM
starting at address BUFFER
and the name length is in
NAMELEN. T he secondary
address is set to one.
If M1 represents the most
siginiﬁcant b y t e  o f  t h e
mantissa and M4  the least
signiﬁcant byte, a  ﬂoating
point number is given by:
2(EXPONENT-129) ( 1+( ( M1
AND 127)+(M2+(M3+M4/256)
/256)/128)
If packed format is used,
the sign is incorporated by
multiplying that lot by:
(-1 )t(rs/11 AND 128)
See what I  mean about
complicated. It also explains
why ﬂoating point operations
are so slow! If you want to
know more about it, try the

; we want to load
; perform load
Save
This routine is called from
$FFD8. Rather more inform-
ation is required before RAM
can be saved. We need to
know t h e  start a n d  e n d
addresses o f  the block o f
RAM. This is achieved in quite
a neat way. The start address
of the block is stored in a pair
of zero page locations in the
usual low/high format. The
accumulator is loaded with
the low byte of this pair. The
end address plus one is stored
in (X/Y) and t h e  routine
called. Listing 2 saves a block
of RAM from address SA to
address F A .  T h e  bas ic
assumptions are as in listing 1_
books cited earlier.
The ﬂo a t i n g  p o i n t
routines us e t w o  ﬂoating
point ac c umulators  f o r
storing data, FAC # 1 and
FAC # 2. FAC # 1 occupies
locations $61 to $66 inclusive
($61 is the exponent and $66
the s ign)  a n d  F AC  # 2
occupies locations $69 to 56E
inclusive ($69 is the exponent
and $6E the sign). Some other
zero page locations are also
used.
Just bear in  mind what
ﬂoating point numbers are
for and we will look at their
manipulation later.

the conversion of integer and
ﬂoating point numbers.
First, t h e ir  ar e t hr ee
routines which will convert a
ﬂoating point number  i n
FAC # 1 to an integer. They
accept integers i n  various
ranges:
$B1AA
This routine takes a ﬂoating
point number in the range
-32767 to 32767 and converts
it to an integar in (A/Y).
$13113F
This routine takes a ﬂoating
point number in the range
zero to 32768 and converts it
to an integer in ($61462).
SB7F7
This routine takes a ﬂoating
point number in the range
zero to 65535 and converts it
to an integer in ($14/$15)-
$113CCC
II you want to perform the
equivalent to INT, this routine
converts F AC #  1 t o  a n
integer and then reﬂoats it
into FAC # 1.
93391
Converts an integer in the
range 0 to 32767 in (Y/A) to a
ﬂoating point  number i n
FAC 1 .
$13DDD
Converts the value in MC 0 1
into a string terminated by 0
and returns with the start
address of the string in (A/Y).
This is the same format as the
print string routine at $ABlE.
To pr int a  ﬂoating point
number in M C  0 1, simply
use:
JSR $BDDD
JSR $AB1E
A routine at $BDD7 does
htis in one go thereby saving
three bytes.
$137135
This r outine performs  a
function similar to VAL in that
it converts a string starting at
($22/$23) and length in the
accumulator to a number in
FAC 4 1
OK, that's all for this time.
Next month Ill continue with
the Basic ROM and discuss
how to pass parameters to
machine code.

Homework To Part 7
Last month's  homewor k
was a mixed bag. Question 1
asked y o u  t o  prov ide a
routine prompting for a key
press. Here is one solution:
In order to save space. the
37
routine uses just one message
with FLAG deciding whether
or not the message is written
in reverse ﬁeld. You should
recognise all the ROM calls
from earlier parts o f  t h e
series. The odd ﬂashing effect
is d u e  t o  inter fer enc e
between the ﬂash and the
screen scan. Press CTRL to see
the effect of introducing a
delay to slow down the ﬂash
rate.
Questions 2 and 3 were

linked and involved redeﬁned

SYS 49152 moves t h e
character set t o  $3000 and
initialises the new set. SYS
49155,X rolls the character X
left one pixel e.g. to scroll A,
use SYS 49155,1.
I'm feeling generous this
month so there's only one
question for your homework.
Imagine that y o u  a r e
writing a  simple adventure
interpretor and that you have
a table of the ﬁrst four letters
of each word in a vocabulary.
For example:
TAKELOOKEATSINGTHRO...
Words less t h a n  f o u r
letters long are padded with
spaces (chr$(32)).
I want a simple routine
which does the following:
1) Prompts a n d  inputs  a
string.
2) Takes t h e  ﬁr s t  f o u r
characters of the input and
searches t h e  table f o r  a
match.
3) If a  match is  found, a
friendly message tells you of
the position of the word in
the table.
4) If no match is found, a
message a d v is e s  y o u
accordingly_
5) The table may be limited to
256 characters (64 words). 1

Eric Doyle looks at some
new utilities from Canada
courtesy of A r i o l aso f t .
I'VE HAD AN INCOMPATABILITY PROB-
lem between my 64 and printer for the
past three or four years. The 64 works
happily to its 40-column screen but my
printer produces 80 column printouts.
My wordprocessor is my bread and
butter, and each month I face the same
problem of formatting my artful prose
into a n  intelligible doc ument b y
switching from a 40-column composing
screen to the double sized output screen
and t hen scrolling bac k  a n d  for th
'windowing' my way around the pages.
Then I  hav e t o  t ur n back t o  m y
(de)composing screen t o  mak e any
changes. I often think how nice it would
be to have an 80-column screen and avoid
this daily chore.
Of course there are ways around this
problem such as  using the Tasword
wordpro which redeﬁnes characters to
force a pseudo 80-column screen on to
the normal Commodore screen but I also
need a jumbo-sized database and spread-
sheet screen.
After obtaining a copy of the excellent
PaperClip wor dpr o a n d  Consultant
database, I noticed that the originating
company, Batteries Included of Canada,
had many other superb products. This fact
has not escaped the ever watchful talent
scouts of Ariolasoft and the result is the
appearance of the B1-80 adaptor in the
Ariolasoft catalogue.
Used with the 1701 and 1702 Commo-
dore monitors, this 80-column adaptor
slots in a 6545 video processor and Basic
v4.0 Disk Operating System into 8K of
memory from $8000 to $9FFF. Existing
software has to be adapted to ﬁt the 80-
column format and skirt around the
essential screen operating system. As far
as I can see this means using Batteries
Included products at the moment but
that's probably a  plus if  you haven't
already shelled out for a wordprocessor.
Installation is simplicity itself. Pop the
unit into the cartridge port and connect
the monitor using easy-to-follow instruc-
tions and supplied adaptor leads. In a
matter of minutes your 64 is ready for
crystal-clear, 80-column, monochrome
working.
One major advantage over the 64's
big, little sister is that switching from 40 to
80, and back again, is achieved by a SYS
command thus  avoiding the hoohah
normally associated w it h  t h e  128's
composite/RGB outputs. Using the SYS
within a  program is  permissable but
although I had no problems in switching
in t he 6545 processor and operating
system without clearing its associated
screen RAM, going i n  t he opposite
direction always resulted in a blank 40-
column screen.
I found no real problem in using either
PaperClip or The Consultant on the wide

IEEE-488 Bus System with Parallel Printer
and Cartridge Expansion Ports
screen even though I was not using either
of the standard Commodore monitors.
Trying it on the CBM 1701 the picture
appeared even sharper.
Another problem I  have with my
printer is the self-imposed one of linking a
Centronics mac hine t o  m y  6 4  i n
preference to the descenderless Com-
modore models. To get a good listing to
print in PETSCII code on an ASCII printer
requires an adaptor. Once more the
Ariolasoft/Batteries Included link - up
rushes to the rescue with BI Interface.
The attachment is  a  little messy
because the unit attaches to the serial port
and taps a power supply from the cassette
port which means that the printer adaptor
dangles off the back of my computer by
two leads. A third lead then trails off to my
printer. This is made even worse because I
also use a disk drive on the serial port, so
the lead to the adaptor has to stretch
across to the daisy-chaining output from
my 1541 to allow the disk drive to be
linked into the system. Aesthetically this is
unpleasing but it is a common problem
with most similar adaptors so you just
have to get used to the idea or do as I do.
By raising the computer on wooden
wedges you can tuck the unit under the
body of the 64 and out of sight.
A M E M I M
Cassette-based system users may be
throwing their hands up in horror at the
thought of sacriﬁcing their cassette port
for a mere power tap. I'm pleased to say
that the back of the plug has a duplicate
cassette connector so that both units can
be used in tandem with no ill effects.
Once installed a few switches have to
be set according to the type of printer on
the other end. You can opt for the usual
device number four or  select ﬁve i f
another printer, such as a daisywheel, is
linked into the system. A second switch
controls the PETSCII/ASCII converter
which I'll explain in a minute. The third
switch acts as a CAPS lock and the ﬁnal
switch w ill add line feeds for  those
printers which fail to recognise 'return'
commands.
The converter switch does not actually
send out the various graphic symbols of
the PETSCII code but converts these to the
kind of abbreviations which are found in
the Basic listings in Your Commodore. For
example, t h e  rev ers ed Q
symbolises a cursor down, CHRS117), will
appear as DW N in brackets. This has two
advantages, the adaptor will work on a
wider range of ASCII compatible printers
and the listings produced are clear and

R e v i e w
unambiguous. Some of the abbreviations
could be better but you get used to what
you're given!
Gathering dust in a cupboard, I have a
4040 d
disk backup procedures. O K, I  c an
struggle along with two 15415 but I need a
special program which always means
slowing down the duplication process.
The v4.0 DOS has useful commands like
BACKUP which can only work on the
older dual systems because all 1.541s have
a driv e number o f  zero and these
commands work on drives with number
zero and one. Hence the insistence on
using a drive number with disk commands
on the 1541 when this is rarely necessary
because the default value is zero. More a
case o f  syntactic good practice than
necessity.
Off the hobby horse and back to the
review. The third RI product is called
BusCard II and it allows the cartridge port
to interface with Centronics or IEEE-488
equipment. Earlier CBM machines relied
heavily on the IEEE connection and many
bargains can still be found in secondhand
outlets. The interface has three outputs;
the normal cartridge port connector, a
parallel output and the IEEE Bus. System
conformation is determined by a bank of
eight switches allowing communication
with a total of seven devices numbered
four to 10.
Connec tion o f  t h e  Bu s C a r d
necessitates delving into the innards of
the 64 to ﬁnd the R44 resistor to which a
clip is  c onnec ted. Alt h o u g h  t h e
instructions g o  o u t  o f  their way t o
describe ac c ur at ely  w h e r e  t h e
connection point is, the words fail to hit
the mark. Terms such as 'right' and
'bottom' are subjective and rely upon
your viewpoint and conception of these
terms_ In their unending quest for clarity,
BI i n c l u d e  t w o  u n a m b i g u o u s
photographs to clarify any doubt that the
verbal description may leave. Nice try but
the important area of these photos is so
dense that any detail is lost in a black blur.
Once the connection has been made
the lead can be left in place, even when
the interface is removed. Apart from this
increased ﬂexibility to your system you
also get v4.0 DOS to enable you to use it to
best advantage,
Before I leave the new Ariolasoft range
I would just like to give a plug for the
aforementioned software packages
which, for my money, give the best value
available.
PaperClip is available for 40-column
C645 and 80-column C64s and C128s,
allowing printouts up to 250 columns
wide. All three versions appear on the
same disk so n o upgrading problems
there. A  dongle t o  plug into y our
joystick port comes with each pack sold
which at least means that you can back up
your disk easily.
What you get for your money is a
word processor which approaches perfec-
tion even though b y  state-of-the-art
standards a few improvements could be
made.
For example, pop-up menus and
attention to irritating features would help.
This includes the fact that pressing the
'return' key halfway along a line erases the
rest o f  that line. Normally this  is
something you can get used to but after a
long night it can have disastrous results_
Here speaks the voice of experience!
Early one morning while writing another
gem for Your Commodore (editor please
note my plea for overtime!), I decided to
amend an earlier piece of text which I had
written. Next morning, or later that day, I
discovered that I'd fallen asleep at the
keyboard, my hand had rested on the
'return' key and effectively erased a
substantial portion of text. Luckily, I'd
saved to disk recently so no major harm
was done but I couldn't help wondering
'What if?'.
Apart from all of the usual facilities
such as search and replace, text block
movement, appending ﬁles and so on,the
program has many extra facilities which
raises it way above the rest The ability to
deﬁne commonly used phrases as a
variable can save a lot of typing time and
41
the production of form letters and assoc-
iated address ﬁles is a boon to mailshots.
For the uninitiated, a form letter is one in
which the text remains the same but
names, addresses a n d  a n y  o t h e r
nominated details are read in from a ﬁle to
customise o r  personalise what would
otherwise be a general circular.
Other word pros look at text blocks as
page width chunks but PaperClip can
select vertical sections of any width so
that tables of ﬁgures can easily be moved
or transposed with the minimum of fuss.
The columns can even be sorted into
alphabetical or numerical order without
leaving the program!
Adding to this full printer control, the
ability to pause to change a daisywheel
with a screen message to say which one,
the ability to produce linked, or global,
ﬁles and you have a very useful tool rather
than a gloriﬁed typewriter.
The Consultant is  perhaps not as
revolutionary but its main advantage is
that it is very easy to build up a database
from scratch. User friendliness is not
something I associate with this branch of
ﬁle management but I have no complaints
with either the 'base development or the
report creation systems in this package.
Multipage records add to the ﬂexi-
bility of information storage and retrieval.
Once your base is established, you can
even produce a ﬁle suitable for form letter
creation for use with PaperClip.
One area I've not covered with any of
these products is the one of cost. Really it
all depends on what you warn from your
system. For the home-user PaperClip's
facilities would lie  dormant and 80-
columns would be an expanse which
could be avoided. For the professional or
serious user it's all a matter of need. One
thing I will say is that any of the products
are worth examining but the peripheral
interfaces are in  a  highly competitive
market where costs and facilities can vary
widely.
My only regret is that I now have to
pack everything away and return it. Hope
the Editor's got a crowbar to release my
grip on these goodies.

issue o f  Your Commodore
did not have a printer option
since I had no access to a
Commodore printer.
After publication I  d i d
manage to gain access to an
MPS 801, albeit  f o r  a n
evening, and was able to add
the necessary programming.
The program w ill pr int

when prompted t o  enter
these records will cause the

Entering -1 will exit back to
the main menu.
A title may also be given to
the printout, eg, date and the
printing can be stopped by
pressing 's'.
All alterations and new
lines are displayed in Figure 1,
Line 3526 allows you to print
records from the latest search

Steve Carrie answers some
of your queries about his
Mach assembler series.
SINCE THE PUBLICATION O F  M Y
Mach Assembler system, several people
have written into the ofﬁce reporting
various bugs. Most of these problems
have occurred with the MONITOR and
MACRO sections of the system, the
ASSEMBLER i s  s o  f a r  causing n o
problems.
Some of the letters I-have received,
have reported problems which have not
shown up on my version of the system. I
suspect that ( due t o  t h e  lack o
checksum error checking on the Basic
listings) these have been caused by
mistakes during entry of the program.
The Monitor
I'll deal ﬁrst with the MONITOR. The
TTY command seems to be causing
problems (again). It would seem that it
will n o t  wor k  correctly w ith disk-
orientated commands_ I'm afraid that,
without a  complete rewrite o f  the
program, nothing can be done about
this. TTY will still work with M,R and
other non-disk commands (and also
with the D command of the Mach 4
extension). If you require a listing of
your source code, I suggest that you exit
to Basic and simply LOAD and LIST the
program to the printer since the Mach 1
editor uses the same area of memory
and the same format as a normal Basic
program.
OK, ﬁrst the TTY command. Below is
a reprint o f  t h e  Mac h 5  printer
alterations which ﬁrst appeared in the
April issue of Your Commodore. In
addition t o  this , a n  extra change
8891 should be 04
8890 should be 04
88A2 should be 04
8460 should be 4C
88A4 should be 00
(address $8460) is included to prevent
the excessive linefeeds during printer
list. Note that the changes originally
included for  the Assembler are not
shown h e r e  s inc e t h e  assembler
accesses the disk drive, it will not allow
the assembly listing to be sent to the
printer. Make the changes in the order
shown.
Use t h e  M  f unc t ion o f  t h e
MONITOR to alter the following:
Next, c hange t h e  f o llo w in g
sequence of bytes: •
address 8E80 20 23 87 AD AF 02 FO 05 EA
EA 20 A8 BE 60 20 12 87 4C 83 BE
address 9EA0 20 A8 BE 6C 02 03 00 00 A2
04 20 C9 El A9 04 85 9A 60
address 89E2 20 80 8E
address 8A4A 20 8E BE
address 88B5 4C AO BE
address 887E EA EA 4C A8 BE
Now save the MONITOR as follows:
S MON 8200,8[00 for original version.
S MO N 7D00,8F00 for the extended
version (Mach 4).
The Macro
Now for the MACRO processor, Firstly,
the save addresses given originally were,
I think, incorrect. The save option is:
S MACRO 9000,9C40
First load and run the MONITOR_
Now exit to Basic and rerun the original
Basic listings of the Macro Processor.
Now the .SER bug can be solved by
setting the byte at address 98F9 to 60
(hex). Further improvements can be
46
made by by 5etting the following sequence
of bytes at address 9206.
address 92D6 A8 99 40 03 C8 CO DO F8
Now y ou c an save t he Mac ro
Processor using the above S command.
This should correct the MACRO
problems.
Some of the letters received asked
speciﬁc questions and the section thai
follows attempts to answer them.
The MONITOR DIR command will
list t h e  directory o f  any 1541/1570
formatted disk (unprotected).
The HEX and DEC commands were
originally included to allow the user to
enter the display data in either HEX or
DEC format. Both should work the same
(apart from the said formats) and return
to the >  prompt.
Some printing errors did occur in the
original series of articles (like missing #
off /  < ).
The M command will display only
eight byte values per line in HEX or DEC
mode.
EPROMing this series of programs
would probably require a rewrite and
since a better version has now been
written I doubt it would be a good idea.
I don't think that the legendary bug
in the early 64 ROM will affect the
system.
I think  I'v e covered jus t about
everything, however if anyone has any
further problems with this system, then
write to: Steve Carrie, 33 Elm Hill,
Arbroath, Tayside, Scotland DD1 4ES_

David Janda brings you mom
news and views from the
!communications world.
FIRST OFF, REMEMBER A COUPLE OF
months ago I previewed the Voyager 7
modem from Modern House, together
with the new Mustang cartridge from Y2
Computing? Well i n  the preview I
mentioned that I  couldn't get t h e
Voyager to auto-answer. It transpired
that the model they sent me hadn't got
an auto-answer board in it, neither have
any Voyager 7s with a serial number less
than 1200. If you have a Voyager that
doesn't auto-answer then send it back to
Modem House says MH's Keith Rose.
Keith is also at pains to point out that the
basic price of the Voyager does include
auto-answer as standard.
I w a s  t o  hav e r ev iewed Y 2
Computing's Bulletin Board software
this issue, but the editor (bow) and
myself haven't managed to get down to
Yrs HQ. But according to Andy Waller,
who runs the Soley Sixty Four area on
Micronet (which has now moved to
*600110) its very nice indeed. f69 inc.
VAT and p&p gets you a very compre-
hensive scrolling type BB package which
can be used on the 64 or C128 with a
single disk drive. Andy has managed to
tweak the package a bit so it operates in
Viewdata format, and he has set up a BB
to demonstrate it (0522-689324, 10PM-
8AM, 1200-75 Viewdata). Y2 also has a
demonstration board which show off
the packages features (0923-50161, 7PM-
9AM, 1200-75 scrolling).
Micronet
The big news this month is all about
MUD (Multi User Dungeon). Micronet's
mega-star PR person Peter Probert
informed m e  a b o u t  t h i s  n e w
development a  day before going to
press. Details are scarce, but here they
are The game should be up and running
by the end of July in which case you may
have already played it! The game itself is
called Shades and is  based o n  the
original Essex MUD. When implemented
on Micronet it will be open access to all
Micronet subscribers; there'll be no
extra subscription charge or anything
like that. The game will be run on a PDP-
11, and I am informed that converting it
to run in Viewdata mode is a major
achievement. No extra link software will
be needed to play the game as is the case
with Compu net MUD, yet there will be
split-screens with current text displayed
in Blue, and previous in Cyan. There will
also be the ability to view past text.
Two key features make Micronet
MUD rather interesting -  capacity and
price. Up to 64 people will be able to
play simultaneously, which is double the
norm. As  far as price is concerned
Micronet MUD will cost just 99p an hour
all inclusive! Compared to Compunets
MUD which costs £1.76 per hour (ex.
VAT), it would appear that Micronet
MUD is exceptionally good value for
money.
Turbo Chat (*811411) has  been
improved t o  accommodate the four
messages per  page. I t  was s till i n
development stages at the time o f
writing and is being offered free to users
whilst on the development stage.
Compunet
If you are not a subscriber to Compu net
then why not? I have been informed by
acting editors MN1, APB1, DM8 and
PD10, who are the business boys behind
the HHGTTG area at 149682 that the
Hitch Hikers Guide T o The Galaxy
directory is  t h e  best new  d ir  o n
Compunet Does this merit a special
investigation b y  Communic ation
Corner? Is it the best thing next to sliced
bread? Would i t  interest Marvin?
Citizens I haven't got a clue! So why
way, on with the drivel.
First, alphanumeric COTOs. I know
have mentioned these before, but now
they have been in operation for a month
it's worth commenting on how effective
they are. Before, to GOTO a particular
area of interest you had to enter the
page where the director was. Now areas
of interest have a name rather than a
number associated with them. Names
are easier t o  remember and it  has
'opened up' Compunet GOTO NEWS,
MEGA, COMMS and so on is so much
easier!
Federation II, the multi-user space
adventure from Compunet is well under
development. Al Lenton at Compunet
informed me at the time of writing that
800 locations had been written so far. No
speciﬁc date has been set for when it will
be on line to all but late Autumn was
mentioned. I  have a little more news
on the Telex front. Compu net intends to
offer Telex facilities around the end of
August. To the best of my knowledge

We review the Adventure
Creator from Incentive
Software.
AT LONG LAST, YOU HAVE FINISHED
your masterpiece. The plot is better than
Lord of the Rings and the problems
would bafﬂe even Sherlock Holmes. The
only snag though is that you haven't got
a clue about programming and it looks
as if you will never be able to convert
your ideas from paper to computer. Fear
not though. Like all the best stories, this
one has a happy ending. For there over
the horizon, like a knight on a white
charger, is the latest utility package from
Incentive -  t h e  Graphic Adventure
Creator.
Written originally for the Amstrad
(when i t  received rave reviews) the
package allows you to turn your game
into a professional looking product with
quickly drawn pictures to accompany
your text if you so desire. You can also
market your product without having to
pay any licensing fee to the authors
although they do ask you to give them a
plug somewhere i n  t h e  game. B e
warned though. You will not be able to
sit down in front of your machine and
start earning lots of money just like that,
there is an awful lot of preparation to be
done ﬁrst.
The main program - the creator itself
- consists of a menu of various options
available to you. From here you can
deﬁne lists of words that will be "under-
stood" by the program, save and load
ﬁles, draw pictures and describe your
locations etc. Before you start doing any
of this, it is advisable to have a labelled
map of your story complete with notes
about the location of objects and details
of the various problems to be solved in
the game. The reason for this is nothing
more sinister than that the logic behind
creating an adventure is so complex. you
simply will not be able to remember it
all.
I found that it was easiest if I started
off by entering all my location descrip-
tions. This gave me a handy framework
to use when I started moving objects
about and playing about with logic
conditions. Each location is  called a
room although it can be anything that
you want from a planet to a matchbox.
Descriptions can be up to 250 characters
long which seems more than adequate
as at this stage you have not yet des-
cribed the exits or objects present. You
are prompted in turn for  the room
number, it s  description, exits and
picture associated with it (if any). You
can also have as many rooms as you want
up to a maximum of 9999. The only thing
that holds you back is lack of memory
and it is up to you to balance the size of
the game against the amount of detail
you require. You start off with just over
23K to play with although there is a fair
bit of data compression done by the
program.
You should now think about creating
lists o f  verbs and nouns that t h e
program will understand. It is worth
while loading the "Quick Start" ﬁle at
this stage as it contains lists of the most
commonly used words as well as some
essentially system messages that must be
included in the game. These can be
edited as you see ﬁt although you must
keep the meanings the same. This allows
you to give your games a more personal
touch they  won't keep coming up with
the same messages as everybody else
who has used GAC. Your list of verbs is
simply entered. Assign each new word a
unique number and that is all there is to
it. i f  several words have the same
meaning, then you give them all the
same number. For example, you might
want "kill", "attack" and "hit" to mean
50
the same thing and so you create verb
number 20 three times over, one for
each of the synonyms.
Any messages that y ou want t o
appear in the text are similarly created.
Nouns and objects are treated slightly
differently though. A  list of nouns is
created as before but any variation in the
form of a particular noun has to go onto
the objects list. For example, assu me that
you want a bucket in your game so you
deﬁne the noun bucket. In the object
list, you then further deﬁne this as a
bucket of water and an empty bucket -

the two forms that the bucket will take
within the game. Objects have to be
given the room number in which they
appear.
Any object which has not yet put in
an appearance or is to be removed from
the game is assigned to room zero, a
mythical location controlled by  the
program. To continue our example, you
can set up the bucket of water in room 1
and the empty bucket in room zero.
Then when the player empties the
bucket, you simply get the program to
swap the objects so that the empty
bucket is now in room 1 and the bucket
of water removed to room zero. Objects
can also be assigned a weight or cost if
you want t o include those particular
features in your game.
The program features a 785 word

R e v i e w
L
vocabulary w i t h  several advanced
features. These include the ability to
understand "it" -  as in "take the book
and burn it" - as well as distinguishing
every single word and not just the ﬁrst
four letters as in most similar programs.
The parser can also cope with adverbs
(open the chest carefully) and adjectives
(get the iron key).
Once you have described all your
words and rooms (and it is really very
simple to do so once you have got the
hang of it) you are ready to get involved
in the nitty gritty of  designing your
adventure, namely putting in the logic.
This is done by establishing a set of
conditions and at ﬁrst appearance, looks
extremely daunting. It still looks that
way at second and third appearance so
take the time to sit down and re-read the
instruction manual very carefully. The
conditions are structured into three tiers
- high priority, local and low priority.
High pr ior ity  involves things  lik e
whether y ou ar e dead and this is
checked before the player inputs his
command. Local conditions apply to the
room that the player is in and might
include things such as is the ﬁre lit or is
he carrying the key. Finally low priority
conditions include general items such as
inventory and score.
The conditions appear as a series of
mnemonics and refer to speciﬁc verbs
and nouns, controlled by the rules of
logic_ A typical entry might be "IF )VERB
20 AND NOUN 15) MESS 35 WAIT END".
This would translate as:- If you type
empty bucket, then print " the ﬁre
splutters and goes out" and then wait for
the next input. Note that before you do
this, you would have to check that the
player was carrying the bucket, that it
was full and that there was a lit ﬁre in the
room. You can begin to see why the
conditions look daunting!
The for mat f o r  t h e  entries is
(CONDITION) (ACTION) o r  ( f t . . )
(THEN DO...) There are 256 markers
that can be set. These are used for
information that can be in either of two
states. For example, a  door can be
locked or  unlocked, a guard can be
asleep or awake. Similarly, you can use
various counters. Yo u  might hav e
ingested poison and must ﬁnd a cure
within 10 moves. When you test your
adventure, you can obtain a  list of
markers and counters, showing their
current states, a useful aid to debugging.
Of course, a vital part of any graphic
adventure creator is  ability t o draw
pictures. Certainly, t h e  examples
included in the small sample game are of
a very high quality and are drawn very
quickly. This knowledge of what can be
produced is very reassuring to someone
like myself with not an ounce of artistic
skill and I found that like the rest of the
package, this part of it was very simple to
use. Each picture is assigned a number
and two pictures can be merged if you
run out of memory or want to show a
51
special effect such as a crystal bridge
appearing over the chasm when you
wave the wand. Most of the picture
would remain the same and you just
need to superimpose the bridge.
You are allowed up to four colours in
each picture although you can obtain
more by a judicious use of the shade
command which produces a stippling
effect using one or two ink colours. You
can create ellipses and rectangles, draw
lines and dots as well as creating mirror
images of your picture. Mistakes are
easily rectiﬁed and you can remove as
many o f  y o u r  prev ious  gr aphic
commands as you want. Speed is very
important in graphic adventures - there
is nothing worse than waiting ages for a
picture to draw itself. CAC scores with a
very efﬁcient ﬁll routine. Some irregular
shapes may need more than one ﬁll
command but you are given hints as to
how to make the most efﬁcient use of
this routine.
I found GAC to be a very simple
product to use. You are prompted for
most o f  your inputs and can always
return easily to the main menu if you
make a mistake. The use of logic takes
some getting used to, riot because it is
very difﬁcult but because there are so
many things that you must think about
and reset. You can guarantee that you
will miss something glaringly obvious. It
is also very easy to miss or ignore your
own faults, so when you think that you
have ﬁnished, get several friends to try

your game out for you land have a go at
inputting as many daft entries as you can
think of in order to see if your game is
properly error trapped. My one slight
criticism o f  the product is  that the
instruction manual could have been
better presented but apart from that, I
can thoroughly recommend GAC as
a useful tool for all budding Tolkiens.

Neil Day with news for Club 128 members.
TRYING TO KEEP YOUR COMMODORE
readers up to date with comings and
going in the Club 128 part of Compunet
is like trying to take dictation on to
marble slabs with a chisel. Things move
very fast on the electronic networks and
it can be a bit hard to keep up. Upload
times ar e often fairly  short, a n d
interesting items are added each day. So
in this  monthly  diar y  y ou'll ﬁnd
references to directories that should be
of long-term interest to Club 128 users,
as well as mentioned of a few speciﬁc
frames that are typical of what you're
likely to ﬁnd. I've asked the authors of
the frames to try to extend them to
ensure they are still available for Your
Commodore readers.
GOTOS
A very simple innovation has provided a
way t o  overcome one o f  the few
irritations on Compunet. The tree-like
directory structure has always made
browsing a rather tedious experience.
Each frame displayed on the screen has
10 entries. One of these usually says
" M O R E "  You select ***MO R E"
to move to the next "branch" of the
directory and then, invariably, have to
move further along the structure with
yet another " M O R E ' ,  and y et
another, u n t il t h e  last syllable o f
recorded time, as Shakespeare used to
say, but he surely wasn't using an ISTEL
line at 90p per hour!.
Thanks to the universal validity of
Murphy's law, the recent and most
interesting new frames are always at the
outer twigs of the tree structure, and is is
usually simpler to read THE JUNGLE
NOW or some other newsy frame to ﬁnd
out about the latest additions (Selecting
GOTO on the duckshoot and typing
NEWS will ﬁnd the latest JUNGLE NOW
frame: well worth checking frequently).
However, since the introduction of
the GOTOS directory, ﬁnding new
frames is a breeze. Select GOTO on the
duckshoot and type GOTOS t o  get
there: t h e n  DIR a  frame f o r  t h e
particular day  you're interested in.
There is one GOTOS directory for each
Life. the universe
and everything
day. So neat and simple it would be
surprising if it hadn't been thought of
before, and it has: ICPUG has been
using a similar system for some time.
Superbase And Superscript
The difference between the people who
write a complex piece of software and
the ones who use it is a bit like the
difference between biological parents
and adoptive ones: all programs bear
the stamp of their progenitors, but for
good day-to-day gossip, you just can't
beat the users! Since the disappearance
of Precision Line, t h e  rarely used
Precision Software directory, ICPUG has
started up an excellent help and advice
directory on Superbase (frame 143672).
In this directory you'll ﬁnd users of the
popular database program talking with a
mixture o f  affection and aggravation
that exactly echoes the weary tones of
52
long-suffering parents w h o  would
manage to ﬁnd something endearing in
the la t e s t  c hains aw  mas s ac r e
perpetrated by their offspring!
If you use the Superbase program
you'll ﬁnd i t  helpful t o  check the
contents of this directory regularly as a
wide range o f  problems ar e very
speedily answered by a number of users
whose pool of experience is impressive.
ICPUG also supports a Communi-
cations directory at 147653. Under this,
at frame 193731, are hints for Superscript
users. For example, there is some useful
advice about how to set up Superscript
ﬁles for input into the Commodore
Modem Editor as Compunet Frames. If
the neanderthal text entry on this editor
drives you crazy and you have a lot of
text to upload, DM87's advise will be
very welcome.
Utilities And Useful Programs
TEC (GOTO TEC) is another good source
of useful applications information and
utility type programs. For example, at
fram 187578 there is a wedge, uploaded
by AWG , t o  enhance Basic w it h
instructions to renumber the lines in
programs, delete a range of lines, and
many other fancy commands.
Another directory which users should
watch, for handy utilities and appli-
cations advice, is the one organised by
the Independent Compunet C lu b
(GOTO ICC). Users of Trigsoft's versatile
UPC1 cartridge should check our PHILS
UPC DI R on 190718 uploaded by APD1.
From this directory you can download
an enhanced version of the Phil's Mon
program supplied o n  disk with the
cartridge.
Well, that better be it for this month.
If you're not yet a member of Compu net
I hope this list of goodies, all available
free incidentally, will entice you to join.
If you area Compunet member, and you
ﬁnd something you think might be of
interest to a wider audience please send
me a courier (NAD2) or mbx Prestel

hit a little white ball into a hole in the
grass that seems to get progressively
smaller the closer you get to it.
Mind you, any game that can keep
editors of computer games magazines
amused during the whole of  a hot
summer afternoon has to be worth more
than a second look!
This golﬁng simulation has one or
two long-awaited factors which have
been lacking in other games of this type
such as Nick Faido Plays the Open and
Golf Construction Set. At last you are
given the exact yardage to the hole from
all positions of the course, so that your
choice of club is much less hit and miss.
This enables you to swing at the ball with
much more conﬁdence.
Two factors that I feel are missing
from this program are that there is no
way of saving the game in progress and
you cannot obtain a golﬁng handicap.
However the graphics are excellent and
the colours have a realistc look. The
sound too is a vast improvement on rival
games. The swish of the backswing and
the thud as clubhead meets ball are
almost as pleasant to the ear as the
gentle 'dollop' as the ball disappears
into the hole.
After entering your names into the
frame, y ou have a  choice o f  four
courses. For breakfast you can start with
a light r omp around number one
course, for lunch you can tackle the
slightly more difﬁcult second, for after-
noon tea the third course becomes a
little heavier but the main course is not
easily digestible and I  suggest a stiff
drink to calm your nerves before taking
on this challenge.
The one thing they all have in
common is that they are completely
surrounded by  water. In fact nearly
every shot means steering the ball
between and over vast expanses of the
deep blue sea_ As a golﬁng hacker
myself, I was slightly disappointed to
ﬁnd the one of the courses did not
resemble a  normal golf course and
lacked the familiar sights of fairways
trees and bunkers.
There are three levels of play, starting
with novice and moving up to amateur
and then t o  professional. A s  y ou
progress from novice to amateur, the
dreaded hook and slice come into play,
and as a professional you have to cope
with swirling winds as well.
But before you attempt these heady
heights, I suggest that you start at the
practice range and tone up your swing
and timing. Then you will be ready to
take your 14 clubs and tackle one or all
four of the courses.
The manual will assist none golfers in
their selection of club as it helpfully
gives the minimax yardages achievable
with all the different woods and irons.
Next you aim the cursor in the direction
you wish the ball t o  go and then
readjust, allowing for the strong wind
that will blow the ball into the nearest bit
of water it  can ﬁnd at the earliest
opportunity!
I'm sure that all sounds rather simple
and I  can hear the seasoned golfers
exclaim: "Keep your head still, left arm
straight, slow backswing, high follow-
through, hit  through the ball, don't
break your wrists too early!" The only
54
thing I can say with any certainty is that
the animated golfer does all these things
better than I do.
The little man automatically starts his
swing when you press the ﬁre button_
However the amount of power in the
shot depends on the exact moment you
release the button during the back-
swing. The hook and slice factor relies
on joystick timing as the clubhead hits
the ball. If you are too early (or nervous!)
the ball will shoot off at an alarming
angle and disappear into the depths. If
you break your wrists too late the ball
will go right and you will probably need
a pair of wellies to retrieve it!
Eventually y ou should reach the
putting surface where at least there isn't
any water, because, unlike most British
courses, it doesn't ever rain in computer
golﬁng games (at least not in any I've
seen so far!). Reading the slope of the
greens comes with practice but you are
given help as to the amount of slope and
whether y ou ar e facing a n  uphill,
downhill or sideways lie. After each hole
the Leaderboard records your score and
that of your rivals,
Leaderboard i s  a n  interes ting
variation on the golﬁng theme and is
well worth buying since i t  can b e
enjoyed at all levels of play. The standard
of the graphics is very realistic which
makes it doubly enjoyable and the skill
factor means the practice should make
beating par an obtainable objective.

Eric Doyle takes a nostalgic
look at the advent of the 64
and speculates on its future.
In a world that is constantly changing,
the longevity of  the Commodore 64
reveals the high quality and advanced
features which it boasted back in 1983.
Sord, Jupiter, Aquarius, Enterprise,
Texas; the list of discontinued lines is a
catalogue of disasters. Even Sir Clive's
Empire has fallen. Commodore may still
be limping from the C16/Plus 4 wars but
the 64 looks as if it will go on for a long
time yet, weathering all the storms safe
within the shelter of the C1213.
As a  refugee from the cramped
conﬁnes of my faithful Vic 20, the wide
open spaces of the 64K memory made
me feel like a pioneer of the old West,
High tech agoraphobia was offset by the
limited RAM for Basic programming but
the rudimentary Basic soon drew me
into machine code programming. Now I
wander about the innards of the 64 as
Freely as I prowl the rooms of my house.
One of the surprising features of the
64 is the SID chip. The sound capabilities
of this phenomenal hunk of technology
are still being explored. To date I've
heard my own voice resynthesised with
Anirog's Voice Master, been stunned by
Rob Hubbard's innovative music and
have recently heard an excellent repro-
duction of a big band digitised in the
States.
The addition o f  Mus ic  Sales'
synthesiser has revived my interest in
keyboard play ing, t h o u g h  R ic k
Wakeman's recent demonstrations
show that I've still got a lot more to
learn!

Basic Problems
The only thing I really detest about the
machine is the feeble excuse for a Basic
language which resides in the ROM. The
advanced sound facilities, sprites and
bit-mapped screen lie beyond the reach
of inexperienced programmers and the
number o f  pokes required mak e
machine code a desirable skill to master.
If the apocryphal tales are to be
believed, the actual 64 Basic was to be a
much more sophisticated implement-
ation but disagreements between the
programming team and Commodore
resulted in the panicky inclusion of the
old Vic style ROM. Simons' Basic was an
early attempt at providing a better Basic
but the cost of the cartridge put most
people off. If Commodore had grasped
the nettle of bundling software earlier
all 64s could have been supplied with a
Simon cartridge. The kindest thing I can
say about this extended Basic is that it
would have been better than nothing.

C 6 4

Although the Basic was initially a
curse, its existence has since given rise to
a wide variety of extensions over the
years, culminating in the recent glut of
cartridges w i t h  on- boar d t o o lk it
commands and a variety of alternative
languages such as Logo, Pilot, Oxford
Pascal, Forth and, more recently, C-
Basic.
CP/M was originally planned as an
extension and the early reviews of the
machine made much of the forthcoming
Z80 module. The reality was less ex-
hilarating than the anticipation. The unit
eventually hauled its elf under  t h e
scrutiny of the public gaze and failed
principally because many of the CP/M
programs were devised for an 80 column
screen, too wide for the 64.
"  l 4 l l a t M a a t i 1 . r 4 S I t t a
Mobilisation
Sprites, Moveable Object Blocks, ﬁred
the imaginations of programmers who
had struggled with the laborious move-
ment of charavters across the (JOG (User
Deﬁned Graphics) landscapes of the Vic
screen. Sections of the screen which
could be moved without affecting the
underlying background opened up the
possibility of more complex gameplay.
The limitation of eight sprites at one
time caused serious ﬂicker effects until
programmers mastered interrupt tech-
niques. This fools the computer into
believing that there are only  eight
sprites but splits the visible screen into
several smaller screens during the scan.
As a viewer of such a game you are
unaware that anything unusual is going
on but the effects can be staggering.
Such was the impact of the sprite
concept that their appearance even
beneﬁtted Spectrum owners. Routines
which produced pseudo sprites were
written and this has resulted in  the
production of the graphically superior
games we see today on all makes of
computers.
It's The Biz
The computer market has been in a state
of constant ﬂux ever since the appear-
ance of home computers. Back in 1980a
PET machine with a mere 16 or 32K of
memory was considered to be a respect-
able business machine. By 1983, the
market had become so sophisticated
with the development of 16 bit machines
that the 64 never really caught on in the
business sector.
Today the 128 is more suited t o
business applications but a lot of serious
software has been produced for the 64
and much of the current 128 software
consists of 80 column conversions of
original 64 programs.
The software varies in quality and
complexity but the 40 column screen is
the real limitation. Many  packages
employ a scrolling screen which pans
sideways as the character count passes
40 Such techniques provide a solution
to the column limitation but this means
that an overview of the document is
difﬁcult unit a printout is made.
Viva 64
The 64 has proved t o the computer
industry that people need compatibility.
After several years o f  buying and
building up a software library no-one
wants to be faced with rebuilding it brick
by brick when upgrading to a newer
model. This is one of the reasons for the
Plus 4's failure and the 128's success.
Many fortunes have been made and
lost in the 64 market and, though the 64
will not go on forever, it will be around
for some time yet.

Eric Doyle leads you through
the long and glorious history
of C64 games of all types.
ANOTHER VISITOR. STAY AWHILE.
Stay for-ever!
When I ﬁrst heard these words, I
knew that Impossible Mission was going
to b e  something special. The voice
synthesis was not only quite clearly
enunciated but also sounded a little like
Vincent Price. When the game started
properly the animation was cartoon-
like.
All this did not disguise the fact that
Impossible Mission was nothing more
than a platform game with the hero
leaping from ﬂoor to ﬂoor collecting
pieces o f  a  puzzle. The difference
between Mission and other games avail-
able at that time was that it set higher
standards of technical wizardry and the
basic gameplay was placed into a new
context.
In most platform games, and this is as
true today as it was then, the aim was just
to collect 'treasure' and nothing more.
The treasure puzzle in Mission was used
to create a further dimension to the
game by acting as a key to the eventual
success of the player.
Although i t  is  refreshing t o  see
ingenuity at work, it would be too much
to expect every game to display the same
degree of original thinking, but to be a
blockbuster a game deﬁnitely needs
something extra. This can be excellent
graphics, sound or it might merely be a
gimmick. It's nice if the game is com-
pulsive or addictive, as well!
Games don't have to be complex to
be addictive. Hewson has had no small
amount of success with Uridium. The
most striking feature of this game is the
use of colour giving the graphics a plaus-
ible 3D look. Apart from that it is just a
good old fashioned shoot down the
alien ships type of game. A  chance
element is brought in where you can
gamble against the computer to gain a
higher bonus which does add extra
excitement to the proceedings.
Shoot-em-ups and platform games,
in one form or another, dominated the
early market. Who can forget Donkey
Kong, Manic  Miner and all o f  the
derivatives? Bu t  players o f  Pacman
would hardly recognise this as a basis for
the multitude o f  mazes which have
enjoyed popularity lately.
581
Into The Labyrinth
Platform games and mazes are very
similar, In each a ﬁxed path has to be
followed and treasures collected. This
has given rise to the maze adventure
where certain objects have t o  b e
collected t o  help y ou t o  proceed
towards the game's end. Only a few
objects can be carried at a time and
some are useful while others are harmful
or serve no purpose at all.
Microdeal specialised in this type of
game with the Cuthbert series and Lands
of Havoc. These days every company
seems to have a maze. Virgin has Sorcery
and Shogun, Blackwyche did very nicely
for Ultimate, Space Doubt from CR1, the
excellent Cauldron II from Palace Soft-
ware and Frankle Goes to Hollywood by
Ocean,
All of these games owe allegiance to
the numerous adventure games which
have been popular since the early days
of main frame computers. An adventure
is a mind game, a series of puzzles which
you must solve by interacting with the
program's database o f  locations and
objects.
Interrogations take place through
textual input. At ﬁrst only two word

Cepiel G a m e s

north, take object, examine object. Ever
since inglish was ﬁrst used in Melbourne
House's Hobbit, the world of adven-
turing has changed. Graphical repre-
sentations were ﬁrst put to good effect
in the Hobbit to supplement the verbal
descriptions of locations, though they
are not the ﬁrst. Sierra On-Line, based in
the States, used graphics in adventures
before the 64 was even dreamed of and
collectable items often used to appear
and disappear in the graphics as they
were dropped or collected.
For sheer devilry and difﬁculty, any
look at adventures would not be able to
avoid Level 9 which specialises in this
genre. T he lis t o f  successes seem
endless: Worm in Paradise, Red Moon,
Dungeon Adventure, Lord's of Time and
many more.
Though Level 9  takes the British
laurels for the best adventures, it is
Infocom's range must be lauded world-
wide. The Zork Trilogy gets harder as
you progress through the series but for
me the best adventure award would go
to Hitch-hikers Guide to the Galaxy. This
little demon follows the comicapproach
which made the radio series so success-
ful. The problems set are so complex and
hilariously funny that it challenges even
the most experienced adventurer.
Board Meetings
Boardgames are a popular source of
inspiration for software writers. Chess,
Monopoly, Scrabble and Trivial Pursuits
have all been successfully translated to
the 64,
I have mixed feelings on some of the
Trivia games because they offer no real
alternative to the board game. US Gold
tried t o  computerise the game with
Monster Trivia but somewhere along
the line no-one thought to Anglicisethe
questions. Anirog had a go with Trivia, a
game based heavily on the original and
with a database generator to allow your
own q u e s t io n s  t o  b e  a d d e d .
Unfortunately the input of answers in
both cases has problems. In Monster
Trivia your spelling and syntax must be
correct: World War Two and the Second
World War are not the same thing to a
computer. An irog's game relied on your
partner verifying your answer and a
better solution to the problem.
By far the best Trivia style game is
Powerplay from Arkana because it keeps
the original idea o f  inconsequential
general knowledge questions but gives
multi-choice answers selected b y
joystick, a board 'game within the game'
where you challenge your partner to a
quick response question and answer
session, and the chance to create your
own question base. The board game is
played on a perspective board in an
Ancient Greek setting where you in-
crease the power of your playing pieces
by correct answers and try to challenge
and overcome your enemy in a Chess/
Archon-like combat.
Most boardgame conversions d o
allow you to select the computer as an
opponent which is handy if you don't
know anyone else who likes to play. The
oldest o f  these is  Chess and much
debate rages about which is the best.
The two main contenders are Audio-
genic's Grandmaster and Colossus
Chess by CDS. Both companies would
argue strongly that their game is the
most challenging but in my opinion the
3D facility of Colossus just gives it the
edge.
Undisputably, Leisure Genius (now
allied to the Virgin Games empire) has
the best range of board games with
Scrabble, Monopoly and Clued°. The
accuracy of these games is guaranteed
because they are licensed by the original
manufacturers.
Card games have been less successful
despite several attempts to spice them
up. The latest and lowest example is
Samantha Fox -  Strip Poker in which
clothes are not the only thing that's been
ripped off.
Big names sell games could be the
current motto of a large section of the
software industry. Brian Jack's Super
Challenge, D a l e y  T homps on's
Decathlon, Steve Davis Snooker, Roland
Rat, Supergran, Minder are all names
given t o  add extra charisma t o the
games.
59
Biggies Flies Down
Film titles have also been attempted but
with less success. Activision's Ghost-
busters proved to be an enormous seller
but for me it was an excellent example of
the emperor's new clothes. The digitised
voice was amazing, the programming
was clever and the reviewers acclaimed
it as a game of great merit. The hype was
immense but the garneplay was dull and
repetitive.
'You've seen the ﬁlm, read the book,
now play the game' is the sort of hype
wihch ﬁlls me with dread. A View to a
Kill, Friday the 13th and the dreadful
Back to the Future were all strongly
bound to the storyline of the ﬁlm on
whose success they depended. It took
Microsoft to prove that games of the ﬁlm
can be created successfully with the
interpretation of Biggles.
Biggles is really four games in one.
The three linked games on the ﬁrst side
of the tape switch about fairly randomly,
but completion of them all gives you a
far better chance to complete side two.
The pleasant part of  all this is that,
though s ide o n e  is  principally a
collection of shoot-ern-up games, side
Iwo is a very simple ﬂight simulator but
has an arcade adventure element. A
wide variety o f  entertaining a n d
challenging games w ith a  storyline
which sticks to the plot.
The inclusion of the simulator was a
calculated risk after the success o f
Ariolasoft's Skyfox. M u c h  m o r e
complex ﬂight simulators abound. If you
want to ﬂy a Harrier see Anirog, Mirror-
soft have a Spitﬁre or  two in their
hangar, Activision allows you to try the
Space Shuttle but by  far t he most
popular subject for simulators is the 747.
One of the most complex is that of Doc
Soft which would provide a challenge to
a professional pilot.
As a ﬂight trainer,Solo Flight from US
Gold is unbeatable, Many years ago I
saw a version of this imported from
American publisher Microprose. It cost
a fortune and did not have the excellent
voice simulation training facilities of this
latest update. For anyone wishing to try

If battles in the air are more your
forte, ACE will give you plenty to think
about. Cascade's heavily publciised
game is one of my favourite pastimes.
Flying a jet in search of your prey brings
all o f  the realism o f  modern aerial
dogﬁghts into your living room.
To Boldly Go...
The most well known ﬂying hits are
those which take place in deep space.
Startrek was the ﬁrst computer game
that I ever heard of and variants have
appeared at regular intervals.
Domark's Codename Ma t t  I I  is
probably the best available which still
retains the true essence of the original
game. The aliens are invading and your
mission is to clean up the galaxy sector
by sector to make the universe a safe
place to live in.
Manipulation of maps, manpower
and machine is the key. Search out and
destroy t he enemy ships around a
gridded area o f  space. When each
enemy squadron is located the screen is
switched from the usual repair and
reconnaissance screens t o  a  battle
screen on which the enemy ships scream
in to the attack.
This idea was taken to its limit by
Firebird with Elite. A cargo ship in deep
space is under control and must be
taken from planet to planet to trade in
goods both legal and contraband. The
proﬁts from successful missions can be
spent on more advanced weaponry for
your ship to protect it from pirate craft
who patrol around the space stations

The most striking part of the game is
the use of 3D wire-frame graphics which
give a real sense of depth to the screen. I
admit that the original BBC version has
more of a fast arcade feeling about it but
on the C64 there is more realism and a
few more problems to contend with.
Another approach t o  the subject
came with the PSI-5 Trading Company
where part of your mission is to select a
crew. Candidates appear with their
curriculum vitae and each one must be
considered for a particular role on the
ship. The sense of realism becomes
apparent when battle commences.
Some of your crew will panic, some go
totally to pieces, but most will hopefully
function even more efﬁciently under
stress.
Psi-5 is a game of total absorption and
one o f  t h e  closest games t o  m y
impression of life amongst the stars, a
feeling whic h is  enhanced b y  t he
excellent graphics.
For sheer programming skill Acti-
vision's Koronis Rift is worth seeing. It is
a planetbound action game based
around an interplanetary scrap metal
company. Find and cannibalise wrecked
ships under enemy ﬁre to improve your
chances of survival.
The planet surface generation
employs advanced fractal graphics
which create a 'real' terrain to roam
about on as you try to locate the tangled
remains o f  unsuccessful pioneers'
spaceships.
This Sporting Life
Simulations of sport may seem like an
odd concept. Many people write them
off because o f  t h e  contradiction
60
between being out there playing the
game and being sat indoors in front of a
TV screen. They are missing the point,
the games should not be seen in the
same light.
The ﬁrst sport simulation that I
bought for my C64 was Commodore's
own International Soccer cartridge,
probably the best game in the catalogue.

of a novelty and we still use it in the
ofﬁce f o r  t h e  occasional league
championship.
Field sports probably account for
more broken joysticks than any other
game but US Gold's Summer and Winter
Games collection are a little less frantic
but much more enjoyable and skillful
than many o f  its  competitors. The
graphics are superb and the only bad
thing I can say is that the British National
Anthem is painful to listen to.

something available. There's Squash,
Basketball, Baseball, American Football,
Soccer, Boxing, Cricket., Snooker and
Darts w it h  addictive oddities lik e
Ballblazer and Rollerball alongside all of
the Martial Arts game.
I've yet to see Polo and Water Ski-ing
simulations but I'm sure it's just a matter
of time.
The current emphasis seems to been
Golf simulations. The best in the ﬁeld
being Ariolasoft's Golf Construction Set
and US Gold's Leaderboard. The two
games are quite different though similar
in appearance. Construction Set has
more technical considerations and the
ability to design, or at least load, many
different courses. Leaderboard has
much more of an arcade feel.
Games have come and gone over the
past three years and it would take several
editions o f  Your Commodore to do
justice to the range of games for the 64.
The market is maturing, but what is
maturing into?
Future Markets
Although t h e  games mark et s till
accounts for the largest part o f  the
industry the competition has heated up
lately with the appearance of budget
programs. Many of them are golden
oldie re-releases but there is a rising tide
of n e w  c h e a p  la b e l pr ogr ams .
Mastertronic has  b e e n  a lo n e  i n
exploiting this area for quite some time
now. Whether this trend will be good for
the market on such a large scale is
debatable. The rewards are small for the
programmer compared t o  t h e  fast
fortunes of the early days. The impetus
to spend time producing large, complex
games will be lessened on a simple
equation o f  r e w a r d s  a g a in s t
development time.
The other side of the coin is that a
new attitude will accommodate the
changing market and it will once again
parallel the pop music industry where
budget and full price products exist
happily side by side.

Eric Doyle looks at the C64's
potential as a small business
machine. I I
AS A POTEN IIAL BUSINESS MACHINE
the C64 is fading fast in the face of the
competition from its big sister the 128.
This does not mean it has no purpose in
business b u t  i t  does highlight t he
advantage of an 80 column screen over
the 64's 40 columns.
Generally s peak ing bus ines s
software can be broken down into three
main categories: wordprocessors,
databases and spreadsheets. Of these by
far the most competitive area is  in
word processing.
Not all businesses will beneﬁt from
computerisation because they can often
demand mo r e  t ime than standard
manual systems, especially if a database
is to be utilised. Another consideration
is your accountant. After all, it is he who
must sort out the information from the
reams of printout paper which the end
of the year will generate. A spreadsheet
is a very versatile and powerful tool but
in the wrong hands it can be more of a
curse than a blessing.
Wordprocessing
To be classiﬁed as a wordprocessor a
program need do no more than to turn
your computer into a typewriter. In fact
the following program could be all you
need i f  you only need to print the
occasional memo:
10 OPEN 4,4,7:A$=" ":?CHRS(14)
20 GET AS.IF 
"
 THEN 20
30 PRINT AS;:IF AS=CHRS(20) THEN
BSFLEFT$tBSIENiB$0-1):GOTO 20
40 1 3 $ =
PRINT 4,13$:BS=”
50 GOTO 20
Such a simple program has many dis-
advantages for serious business applica-
tions. The width of the text is ﬁxed to the
width set on the printer, paragraph
lengths must be less than 255 characters
and words whic h ar e too long t o
squeeze on to the end of a line will be
split in an arbitrary manner_
The professional user w ill meet
circumstances where t he document
width varies, they may prefer right
justiﬁed alignment like the columns of
this article and repeated page headers,
footers a n d  number ing m a y  b e
required.
As s omeone whos e liv elihood
depends on the printed word, my own
requirements stretch to word counts
and character counts to make sure my
copy will ﬁt into the space allotted
by the editor. Being fallible, I occassion-
ally spell words incorrectly so a spelling
checker is required and I sometimes
want to search through my text for a
particular word or phrase which I wish to
change s o  a  'search and replace'
function is essential.
A good general purpose word-
processor i s  Speedipen f r o m ICI_
Software. It lacks a spelling checker, a
wordcount and has only rudimentary
printer controls. It does have all of the
other functions and the manual is slim
and easily assimilated. Tasword 64 and
Supersoft's WordPerfect are also worthy
of consideration.
For mo s t  business us ers  t h e
enhanced printing facilities of an Epson
or Star machine may be desirable. In this
case o n e  o f  t h e  mor e expensive
wordpros will be needed. The two main
contenders are Ariolasoft's Paper Clip
and Precision Software's Superscript.
Both offer a full range of advanced
facilities inc luding s pell checking,
special printer commands and 'mail
merge'.
Mail merge is particularly useful for
mailshot purposes. We've all seen the
personalised letter s  w hic h mak e
comments such as, "the prize car will be
delivered to the Smith household at 22
Yourstreet, Yourtown". Every letter has
the name and address of the recipient in
the relevant place. To do this a list of
names and addresses is stored on a
database and a general letter is written
on the wordpro. Instead of an actual
name and address, the letter contains a
coded symbol which sets the printout to
search the database for the next name
and address and insert it in the text. In
this way several hundred personalised
letters can be printed out with each
recipients name inserted correctly.
As a guide to prospective buyers I
would suggest that you go for the most
complex wordprocessor that you can
afford, ensuring that the manual is com-
prehensive and c omprehens ible.
Although y ou won't use all o f  the
functions all of the time you will bless
62
the wisdom of your decision as your
business needs expand. The home user
probably won't need to use a wordpro
very often but it's handy for creating
party invites, jumble sale ads and the like
as well as storing oft used documents
such as  curriculum v itae f o r  j o b
applications. In this case your needs will
be modest so go for the cheaper end of
the market armed with the knowledge
that there are plenty of sharks in this
range.
Databases
Databases are ﬁlling systems which can
use the special facilities of a computer to
create a cross-referencing system which
would be impossible with a standard
ﬁling cabinet.
Many databases are available but
care mus t b e  taken i n  making a
selection. I was using First Publishing's
FirstBASE for a demonstration recently. I
chose it because it is easy to understand
and simple to set up. During the demo I
accidentally hit the wrong key, the
program crashed and I lost some of the
information which I had entered. This
was no major disaster but it did not
impress my audience when I had to
reload the program all over again. 'Time
is money in my business. I wouldn't want
that to happen too often.', remarked
one of the observers,
still use the program for my demon-
strations because in  many ways it's
excellent for modest applications and
it's disk based. Disks are essential to
make a database work efﬁciently other-
wise you are limited to the computer's
memory size to store all of the entries.
This is alright for home use but for
business it would be a non-starter. If
each ﬁle is just 256 characters long you'd
be lucky to get more than 150 entries
which could be manipulated at onetime
and each time you add to or update your
ﬁle it means resaving the whole ﬁle set at
the end of each session. If the computer
locks up you'd have to re-enter the
whole series of corrections and altera-
tions again.
Before considering disk systems let's
look at a tape system from Dutch based
company Radarsoft distributed b y
Ariolasoft in this country. Databasis is
data processing at its simplest level. The
ﬁrst requirement is  an input sheet

(template) w h ic h  has  a l l  o f  t h e
categories of information printed on it
and space to put in the speciﬁc details
for each ﬁle entry.
The Databasis program has two ready
made templates, one for an address ﬁle
and the other is a catalogue for your
record collection. There is  also the
facility to create your own template.
Each unit of a database is known as a
record and each entry on the record is
known as a ﬁeld. Databasis allows you to
select particular ﬁelds and a range of
records for sorting into alphabetical or
numerical order and for hardcopying on
your printer.
The system limits y ou t o  36,000
characters with a  maximum record
length of 250 characters. For a system
which fully utilises the maximum record
allotment, the ﬁle would only allow 144
records. Great f o r  home us e b u t
seriously limited for even the smallest
business.
Disk systems us e memory very
sparingly, normally only  having one
record in memory at a time. Each record
has an allotted space on the disk and this
is the same number of characters for
each record.
When designing a template you are
requested to specify a length for each
ﬁeld. This is the maximum number of
characters which will ﬁt. For example, if
you design a ﬁeld for Surname it has to
be long enough for any surname you are
l
save on disk space. A ﬁeld length of ten
characters would be ﬁne if you only
know people called Smith, Jones or
Williams but if a Fitzwilliam turns up
you'd have to redesign the whole record
template to accommodate them. This
could mean re-entering all o f  t he
existing entries on to the new template,
a daunting task as your ﬁle grows.
If a ﬁeld is larger than the entered
information the computer generates
padding characters which will not show
up on the screen but increases the entry
to a standard length for storage. In this
way all of the entries on the disk are the
same length and a redundant record can
be replaced by a new one without fear of
overwriting another viable entry.
The most powerful database on the
market i s  Pr ec is ion Softwar e's
Superbase, T he facilities mak e t h e
manual a daunting prospect. In anticipa-
tion o f  this the package contains an
audio cassette tutorial which will at least
make 80% of users proﬁcient enough to
satisfy their  o w n  database needs.
Advanced requirements are catered for
in the manual and for those who still
have trouble there is  a  very useful
supplementary b o o k  o n  advanced
techniques av ailable f r o m  t h e
manufacturers.
Using the sort and search facilities in
this program you can specify several
parameters. For instance, if you want to
ﬁnd all Commodore 64 owners named
John, with blue eyes and living in New-
castle, you can do it assuming you base
has ﬁelds for such information.
When printing out information you
don't always need all of  the record
information printed out and often the
order on the template will be wrong.
This necessitates the creation of a report
card template which uses speciﬁed
information from the standard record
set and prints it out in the given manner.
Spreadsheets
For home use, spreadsheets and similar
account programs are not usually neces-
sary. Many home accounts programs
have been published but, f o r  t he
majority of people, a record of the year's
spending is not required. On a monthly
basis, the ﬂuctuations in incomings and
outgoings can be better dealt with using
pen and paper and probably in less time
than it takes to load the program.
A spreadsheet is a matrix of boxes.
Nothing more, nothing less. What
makes it so special is that the user can
deﬁne the number and contents of each
box.
The boxes are known as cells and
after decided the dimensions of the
spreadsheet you can then deﬁne the size
and contents of each cell. A cell can
contain o n e  o f  f o u r  ty pes  o f
information: descriptive text, a blank
space, a numerical value or a formula.
Descriptive text is used for column or
row labels to clarify the purpose for that
series of cells. The computer does not
need labels  b u t  y o u  a n d  y o u r
accountant will.
Fixed sums are entered as numerical
values. An example would be a list of
unit costs and quantities on an invoice
spreadsheet. Each box is located by a
general labelling system which often
takes the form of letters across the sheet
and numbers down the sheet. Locating a
particular cell requires the input of the
two co-ordinates such as d5 or z9. If a
sheet has more than 26 characters wide
then double letter labelling is used e.g.
AA,BB,CC etc. or AA,AB,AC...AZ,BA,
BB,BC etc.
To save time and utilise the computer
to bes t advantage, c ells  c an b e
controlled by formulae. In our example
of an invoice, placing a value in the
quantity column and a ﬁxed value in the
unit cost column could automatically
generate a total for each entry on the
invoice and update the grand total and
VAT section at the bottom of the invoice
sheet,
The problem with a spreadsheet is
that the sheer size of the matrix will not
ﬁt on the screen and a method of
window scrolling has been devised to
partially overcome this problem. This
works well when typing in cell contents
but often on a ledger spread you will
want to compare two entries which are
at opposite ends of the sheet. One solu-
tion is to printout the sheet but this is
time consuming so most sheets allow
split screen viewing. In such a situation
you can specify that certain cells will
appear on one half of the screen and a
63
separate distant set of cells will appear in
the other half. Often this facility is
further enhanced by allowing the two
screens to be scrolled separately.
Printouts are another headache for
the spreadsheet programmer and two
principal s o lu t io n s  h a v e  b e e n
formulated, horizontal o r  vertical
printing.
In horizontal printing the ﬁrst 80
columns of the spreadsheet are printed
across the paper and the full length of
the sheet is printed down the paper. The
printer then prints the next 80 columns
under this and so on until all of the
columns have been printed. The next
job for the user is to set to with sticky
tape and construct the full sheet from
the 80 column sections.
Vertical pr inting is  s imilar t o
horizontal but the letters are printed at a
90 degree rotation and it is the ﬁrst 80
rows which appear across the top of the
page until the last column is printed and
then the next 80 rows are tackled.
A further u5e of the spreadsheet is
especially useful as the business changes
in size. Because the columns can affect
one another it is possible to artiﬁcially
alter entries to see what the net effect
will be.
If you decide that a higher grade raw
material will improve your product sales
over a period of time, you can put in the
new cost and immediately see the effect
on your proﬁt margin. Estimating the
effect your improved product will have
on overall sales will allow you to see how
soon the business will recover, a useful
demonstration when persuading your
bank manager to make the necessary
funds available.
Although I have said that the 64 is limited
to 40 columns there is a way around this.

an 80-column screen chip in place of the

Consultancy are all available on the

HIRNITIIRE
Eric Doyle cuts his way A
through the jungle of
cartridges now available for
the C64.
IITI LAITY
CAR OWNERS HAVE BEEN CUSTOM-
k ing t h e i r  v ehic les  f o r  y ears .
Modiﬁcations r ange f r o m  m e r e
decoration to the purely practical and,
although furry dice and go-faster stripes
have yet to appear, there is a simlar trend
in the computing world. Utilities of all
kinds abound and the current trend
seems to be more towards cartridges
than either disk or cassette.
Cartridges are the most efﬁcient way
to store programs and can achieve
fasterloading rates than any  other
storage medium. Why is it  that this
market has only recently blossomed?
Up to the beginning of last year the
majority o f  cartridges available were
Commodore's own, most of which were
less than average games. Companies
such as Supersoft had pioneered the
ﬁeld of utility programs with monitors
and toolkits but it is fair to say that these
weren't as freely available as the range of
disk and cassette utilities.
Today there are several companies
producing cartridges and most of them
have Dutch connections. The widest
range belongs to Robtech but there are
also Evesham Mic ro Centre's Freeze
Frame, the Power Cartridge from KCS,
Home and Personal Computers Final
Cartridge, and the Expert System from
Trilogic. Mos t carry machine c ode
monitors on board, have some form of
disk turbo and a reset switch.
The Robcom 50 cartridge has a Basic
toolkit which adds useful keywords such
as RENUMBER t o  ev en o u t  lin e
numbering intervals and AUT O  t o
generate lin e  numbers w it h  equal
spacing. The machine code monitor
occupies fr ee R A M  a t  49152 b u t
it can be relocated in  any part o f
memory.
By far the most interesting aspects of
the u n i t  ar e t h e  tur bo facilities.
Alongside a special tape turbo is a head
alignment facility to make sure that the
tape recorder is set up correctly. O f
course, only  Robcom tur bo saved
programs w ill tur bo load because
commercial cassettes carry their own
unique turbo systems. This is not true of
the turbo disk system which improves
the speed of any normally saved disk
tenfold.
The main problem with the Robtech
systems is  that they  currently us e
computer RAM and many programs will
overwrite t h e  c ar tr idge lo a d e d
operating systgem and cause a crash.
The Land Of OS
The new generation of cartridges are
ethereal phantoms of the Operating
System. Using just and handful of bytes
as a toe-hold in the host computer they
exist in symbiotic harmony to the user's
beneﬁt. It is interesting to ponder that
the reason for this development has its
roots in piracy.
The development o f  the British
market has always relied heavily on
cassette based software. I was fortunate
enough to have a disk drive in the early
days and slow loading cassette games
were frustrating t o  use, rather lik e
having to ride your bike everywhere
because there's no petrol for your sports
car. Like many other people, I spent my
time ﬁnding ways to transfer the tape
programs on to disk. The arrival of turbo
tapes was initially a relief and in some
cases these loaded faster than disk. Soon
turbo disk systems were developed and
was thrown back into my search for
transfer programs.
Now t h e  main function o f  t he
cartridges is to create backup copies of
cassettes on to disk. This has created a
major controversy i n  t h e  industry
because ther e is  nothing t o  s top
unscrupulous people fr om making
illegal copies for their friends. lust as
home taping is killing the pop industry,
so backup piracy injures the computer
trade. Dongles and other  software
protection systems have been tried but
this increases the cost of programs and
any commonly adopted system would
soon lead to a black market counter
measure. Optical systems like Lenslok
are good ideas b u t  render many
programs useless to me because of my
large screen monitor.
64
Various pressure groups have been
formed to suppress piracy but to no
avail. T h e  s olution lies  w it h  t h e
development of safeguards within the
computer itself.
Beating Basic
Basic is a convenient language to put
your computer through its paces but it is
also a  very inefﬁcient system. Most
programmers would like to use machine
code but few can spare the time. The
slowness of Basic can be overcome by
converting the code using a compiler.
A program is stored in memory as
raw Basic code. When the program runs,
this code is interpreted word by word as
a jump table to various routines which
handle the variables dictated by  the
program. Basic is therefore known as an
interpretive language.
A c ompiled program i s  faster
because t h e  interpretation stage is
performed when the program has been
written a n d  debugged a n d  t h e
c onv erted p r o g r a m  i s  s av ed.
Compilers, such as Basic-64 from First
Software and Blitz from Supersoft, are
disk based and often take a while to
actually convert a program. Patience is
rewarded with a program which will run
extremely quickly and often occupies
less space in memory. Both systems will
operate with most Basic extensions but
these must be resident in the machine
when the program is used.
Basic-64 just has the edge because it
will accept positively dimensioned
arrays b u t  Blit z  w o n ' t .  Program
dependent arrays dimensioned by  a
variable will not be accepted by either
e.g. DIM AN .
If you decide to try machine code, an
assembler is essential. Although crude
assemblers a r e  available i n  mos t
cartridges they are not as ﬂexible as a
double pass assembler such as Laser
Genius from Ocean.
True assemblers allow you to write
your program using numbered lines as
in Basic. Instead o f  the usual Basic
commands each line has one mnemonic
machine code command and lines can
be inserted or deleted as the program
develops.
Laser Genius allows you to use labels
for jumps within a program. This means
that instead of calculating the value for

the jump, a  name is  given t o  the
instruction which forms the entry point
to the required routine. The assembler
program will insert the necessary value
for the jump when the actual code is
written by the assembler.
The great advantage of such a system
is that instructions can be inserted into
the code when debugging or improving
a routine without having to worry about
the effect this may have on the rest of the
program. The nearest equivalent to such
a labelling procedure in Basic is the
subroutine procedure deﬁnition in BBC
Basic. Even on the 64, if you add a line or
two, you have to ensure that none of the
jumps have been affected by the added
lines.
Keeping On-Line
I've already mentioned Robtech's
azimuth alignment utility  o n  t h e
Robcom Cartridges but there is also
Interceptor Software's kit. The Power
Cartridge fr om KCS has a n  audio
function which is designed to allow the
user to listen through a multiload tape
for the point at which the desired
program starts. A secondary advantage is
that you can use this function to crudely
align your tape head.
Disk drives are a different matter and
can be quite costly to re-align. Robtech
produces a disk maintenance kit which
allows you to perform this task without
any great technical knowledge. Re-
alignment is fairly simple to achieve but
65
the necessary adjustments mean that
some dismantling o f  t h e  driv e is
necessary.
With such a range of utilities, the 54
can b e  customised t o  y our  o w n
particular needs. This is  t h e  main
advantage of a mature machine because
you g e t  t h e  beneﬁt o f  years o f
experience and experimentation. There
is still plenty of room for innovation but
the advent of the new series of compu-
ters may cause a slow drying up of speciﬁc
64 developments. On the cheerful side,
there is a 64 in the 128 and I remember
rash statements of the death of the 64
when t h e  Plus /4 and C- 16 wer e
launched. Look what has happened to
them. Long live the 64.

David Janda dons his white
coat to examine the
lenatomy of C.
IN THIS ARTICLE, I INTEND To TAKE A
look at the structure of a C program,
together with an overview of the basics
necessary in understanding C.
Data Types
C has a variety of data types. When a
constant is  declared, the micro can
usually tell what ty pe the variable
should take by simply looking at the
data that will initialise it. But what if the
value is to change? The compiler needs
to know what type of data is going to be
held in a particular variable, and that is
why dec lar ing variables i s  v er y
important.
There ar e seven basic types i n
standard C:
int
long
short
unsigned
char
ﬂoat
double
In standard C — int, long, short and
unsigned would be data types that are
used to represent intergers — whole
numbers. Int is usually assigned with the
standard word size of the micro. A short
integer can be no longer than int and
long no smaller than int.
However, actually implementing all
these different types on a small version
of C can be impracticle, and often, one
type can store the same value as
another.. T h e  C  Pow er  package

(reviewed in Your Commodore June
1986) makes no distinction between int,
long and short; they are treated by the
compiler as being the same. In the case
of C Power, int, long and short use two
bytes (16 bits) to represent numbers, so
the range of the integers that these types
can represent is from -32768 to +32767.
Actually declaring the variables is simple
enough, just specify the type followed
by the name of the variable:
int age;
long count;
short box;
int a, b, c;
As you can see, more than one
variable can be declared on the same
line.
A variation of integer variables is the
unsigned integer. An unsigned integer
must not be less than zero. It normally
occupies the same space in memory (in
C Power this is true) and thus can be
larger than a signed integer. Declaring
an unsigned integer is done as follows:
unsigned int fred:
The char type is in fact an unsigned
integer in the range of zero to 255. The
computer translates a  number t o  a
corresponding character. Declaring
char variables is done as follows:
char initial;
char ﬁrst, second, last;
char letter = 'A'
Float and double are types used to
represent numbers with a  fractional
part. In standard C, double can store a
number greater than ﬂoat, but in C
Power they  ar e treated t he same.
Declaring ﬂoating point variables is
done like this:
ﬂoat pi;
ﬂoat part = 66.342
Constants can be deﬁned in each
type:
66
whole = 1234;
letter = 'B';
beep = 9007';
laugh = 3.14111;
It's important to note that in the
example the characters /007 were NOT
assigned to beep. There are characters
in the ASCII/CBM codes which cannot
be displayed. C allows a character to be
represented as long as it is preceded by
the backslash character. Another
method is to use escape sequences:
/n — newline
it — tab
/b backspace
/r — carriage return
if — form feed
/ /  — backslash
— single quote
I" — double quote
As an example, consider this line of
C:
print f("This line/nis split")
This would be printed as:
This line
is split
Why? Because the escape sequence
/n would print a new line. This type of
feature is very useful in C Power, as it
enables control codes (such as those for
colour) to be embedded in text.
String handling is also catered for in
C. However, unlike Basic, a C string
cannot be dynamically created. It must
be declared like all other C variables.
Further mor e, y ou cannot declare
strings like this:
char name = "Your Commodre";
Consider this example:
main ()
/* A simple C example •/
char name[401:

E199 95

P r o g r a m m i n g
printf("Hello, what's your nameUn");
scanf ("%s", name);
printf("Pleased t o  meet y ou %s,"n
name);
What's going on? Well, ﬁrst the
name is stored in any array whose type is
char. The functions printf() and scanf()
are used for I/O, and the conversion
speciﬁcation 'cx,s' is used to get and put
the actual string.
C has a number of functions that are
associated with string handling. First, it is
vital to point out that even though a
string may  b e  dimensioned t o  n
elements (in our example 40), once a
string has been assigned to the array, the
end of the string will be followed by a
zero (null) character. In other words, if a
string array of 10 elements was speciﬁed,
and I entered my name, the array would
look like the following in memory;
DavidOnnnn
Where 'n' is an unassigned element
of the array. This is important when
learing how to use C functions.
C string functions may vary between
different implementations of C; here is
what C Power has to offer.
strncat (sl, s2, n)
strcmp (51, s2)
strncmp (51, s2, n)
char strcpy (sl, s2)
char strncpy 5 2 ,  n)
strlen (5)
char index (s, c)
char rindex c )
The ﬁrst two functions join strings si
and s2 and leave the result as st strncat
differs in so far as it will only copy n
elements. The next two functions are
used to compare two strings, and will
return a value of zero if the two strings
are the same size, < zero if sl is less than
s2 and > 0 if 51 greater than s i
As with the previous example, the
second of the pair will only work on n
characters. The next pair of functions
will copy 52 into st and strlen will return
the number of characters in a string.
The last two functions will set a
pointer t o  t h e  leftmost/rightmost
occurence of character c in the string S.

C is a very powerful language. It will
be one of the most popular languages of
the BOs -  90s and will no doubt spawn
many varients. It has been described as a
'crude' language; that is, one that has
many hi-level features, yet is to low level
in many respects.
Whatever the case, it is portable,
compact and fast -  three character-
istics which are important for micro
users.
Loops -  for, while, do
Decision -  if, else, switch, case, default
Branches -  break, continue, goto
Data types -  car, int, short, long,
unsigned, ﬂoat, double, struct, union,
typedef
Storage classes -  auto, extern, register,
static,
Please note that n o t  a ll these
keywords may be implemented on all
versions of C.

which chips do what.
LOOK INSIDE A COMPUTER
and what do you see? Lots and
lots of chips. What are they
doing there?
It is tempting to visualise a
computer's memory  as  a
massive s la b  o f  tar mac
covered i n  thousands o f
regular depressions whic h
hold numerical values. For
the user this image may be
very us eful b u t  t o  t h e
designer nothing could be
further from the truth. The
architecture is as complex as
any gothic cathedral and yet,
in a similar way, the many
small parts are united by a
poetic, logical oneness.
Although I will be looking
at the C64 i n  detail, t he
principles ar e tr ue for  all
computers whether made by
Commodore o r  not .  T h e
architecture o f  a computer
can b e broken down into
several main areas: R AM,
Basic interpreter, i n p u t /
output routines  (kernal),
character pattern information
and video/audio/peripheral
communication channels.

Memory
As everyone ﬁnds when they
power up their brand new 64,
only 38K of this memory is
available to the user for Basic
programs with a further 4095
bytes lying idle at the higher
end o f  memory ready for
machine c o d e  programs
(49152-53247). The memory.
block diagram shows how the
standard memory is laid out
under normal circumstances.
This brings us back to the
tarmac slab syndrome. The
diagram actually represents
the contents of several chips
scattered widely about the
printed circuit board inside
the computer's casing.
The largest section of the
64 is comprised of eight RAM
chips bearing the numerical
code 4164 or 3764. Each chip
contains 8192 m e m o r y
locations (bytes) and together
they form the 64K of RAM
implied by  the computer's
name.
Given that the total 64K of
RAM occupies all memory
locations up to 65535, how
can the ROMs occupy some
of these locations at the same
time?
Remember that the brain
of the computer is the CPU
(the 6510 chip). This can be
commanded to communicate
with s pec iﬁc  ar eas  o f
memory. looking at the 3D
r epr es entation o f  t h e
computer's memory y ou'll
see that R AM and R O M
memory is 'stacked' in certain
areas. To give a memory con-
ﬁguration as shown in  the
previous diagram, the CPU
must b e  t old with whic h
layers of these stacks it can
communicate.

You may also notice that
the higher  p a r t  o f  t h e
memory is triple layered in
places. The selection of which

computer. Here the character

communicates t h e  inputs
from t h e  k ey board, t h e
cassette recorder and t h e
joystick ports. CIA2 controls
the user port and the serial
DIN socket for printers and
disk drives. Highly charged
owners of a C128 may have
found that sparking their
static charge to the joystick
port results in the need to
replace CIA'. Delicate things
these chips!

Burnt Chips
What is a chip? We all know
that i t  contains memory
locations b u t  h o w  is  t h e
information stored?
The standard description
of a byte is a row of switches
which may be off (0) or on (I).
In electrical terms this means
that a one is represented by
an electrical voltage, a zero by
no voltage.
This achieved in different
ways depending on whether
the chip is RAM or ROM. The
difference between RAM and
ROM is that RAM is volatile
and anything stored there
disappears when the machine
is turned off (usually by one of
the kids playing with the
mains p lu g s ) .  R O M  i s
unchangeable w it h  eac h
memory being 'bur nt i n '
permanently.
Each byte in the ROM is
represented by  an array of
eight diodes which act like
little fuses. When a chip is
programmed a  zero bit is
created by  overloading the
corresponding diode. T he
diode blows like a fuse and
the bit can no longer pass a
current, the computer reads
this as zero, This method is
consequently k n o w n  a s
'blowing' a chip.
RAM chips fall into one of
two categories: dynamic or
static. Most of the differences
will n o t  concern us  her e
except t h a t  dy namic  i s
cheaper to buy but not as easy
to maintain as static. In the 64
the only  static RAM c hip
holds the colour information,
the rest is dynamic.
Bit information is held as a
charge or lack of charge on
arrays of tiny capacitors. This
charge has a tendency to leak
away fr om dynamic chips
and must b e  refreshed at
regular intervals. The busy
bee Vic chip helps out here by
doing the rounds every three
thousandths of a second.
Small power  surges a t
power u p  c an randomly
charge u p these capacitors
which is why you must never
assume that any  memory
location is set to zero.
Controlling t h e  c om-
puter's memory is the key to
exciting programming on any
machine. I n  future install-
ments we will look at the
major Commodore home
computers and see what can
be learnt by comparing and
contrasting their chips.

Like everyone that has had the pleasure of seeing this system in
operation you will be amazed by both the speed and ease of
use. It is compatible with the majority of commercial software,
speeding up both the program loading and SEOIREL ﬁles
Fitting requires the insertion of two sub assembly boards, one
in the 154 I and one in the '64/•128. This does not normally
entail soldering, although a small amount will be necessary
with some machines.

E d u c a t i o n
Margaret Webb brings you
the latest in spelling
packages.
FOR A LONG TIME TEACHING AND
learning spelling has been approached
in a very "laissez faire" manner. It was
thought that correcting the way a child
spelt a word would stop the creative
ﬂow and thus stunt the pupil at an
important point i n  his  educational
growth. I don't wholly subscribe to this
theory; the rules of spelling have to be
learnt, especially i n  a n  age when
illiteracy seems to be everywhere and
being literate may help the child in a
shrinking job market.
Of course, society and advertisers in
particular, seem to be contriving t o
undermine any good work being done
in o u r  s c h o o ls  i n  l a n g u a g e
development. How many times have
you, for example, seen phrases such as
"Kwik Save", "Beanz meanz Heinz",
"lotta bottle", "lo fat"?
As yet, I have not seen a computer
program which teaches and tests the
rules of spelling such as " i before e
except after c". This is surprising since it
is fundamental to our spelling system
(illogical though i t  may  seem o n
occasion). Instead, software authors
prefer to tackle spelling from the "word
list" approach whereby you test, by rote,
the child's knowledge of lists of words.
Whilst this technique has its value, it
should be used to help reinforce the
spelling r ules  a n d  highlight t h e
exceptions to them. There appears to be
a dearth of spelling software around but
here a couple which may be of help.
Word Wobbier from Longmans is in
the form of a game in which you move a
little man around a grid collecting the
letters in the correct order to spell the
proscribed word. The grid is constructed
from vertical and horizontal conveyor
belts and has, of course, the obligatory
nasty which tries to kick you off the grid.
The game has a number of faults,
Movement along t h e  conveyors is
sluggish and can often lead t o  an
impossible situation where you cannot

move from a letter square before it
changes, thus loosing a life. Another
fault is the difﬁculty level, At the "very
easy" level, words such as "notice" and
"important" are given -  hardly easy
words! Both of these faults tend to cause
the child to lose quickly and thereby
give up as a failure.
However, these are not the worst
parts of the game. In order to tell the
player which word has to be spelled, the
word is put on the screen. Surely this is
self defeating.
A more effective way would be to
illustrate the word to be written out. This
method has its limitations in that not all
words can be adequately turned into
recognisable graphics. In addition,some
degree of ambiguity may occur, for
example, the words vase, urn, pot and
crock could be represented by the same
picture. This approach can, however, be
implemented t o  provide a  simple
learning program to help infants with
reading and spelling of basic words such
as colours, zoo and farm animals, toys
and parts of the body. I'm not aware of
any computer programs which use this
approach although hand-held games
have used this principle for several years
by asking the user to write the word for a
picture speciﬁed in a booklet.
Programming the computer can be a
sort of spelling aid. Anyone who has
dabbled with programming will know
that a  spelling mistake results in  a
"SYNTAX ERROR". Playing adventure
games c an als o reinforce spelling
technique. The use of an incorrectly
spelled word usually results in a "Sorry I
don't understand..." phrase. This could
be used to good effect in conjunction
with the graphical technique described
earlier in the form of simple graphical
adventures. The player would only be
allowed to take or use an object if the
word is typed in correctly. There must be
enterprising teachers/programmers
who can implement these ideas in really
effective software.
The advent of speech synthesis has
brought a whole new slant to learning
spelling since you can now be told what
to spell.
The Cave of the Word Wizard is a
disk based game in which the child
guides an explorer through eight levels
of caves looking for four jewels. He has
with him a torch to ﬁnd his way around
and a  pack of  sticking plasters. The
plasters are your "lives" and are used up
if the explorer trips over a rock or is
bitten by "nasties". The torch battery
tends to run down and leave you in the
dark unable to ﬁnd your way out. Both
battery power and band-aids can be
replenished by spelling words correctly
when the wizard magically appears and
tells you a word.
There a r e  1 0  carefully graded
spelling lists starting at list one with very
simple words such as ant, cat, red, man,
toy and web, through to level 10 words
such as synonomous, photosynthesis,
correspondence and pterodactyl. All in
all, about a thousand words which will
keep players of all ages busy. T h e
animation is not exactly state of the art
but it's some of the best around for
educational software. Certain words can
be difﬁcult to understand because of the
limitations of electronic intonation but
this is the best speak and spell game I've
seen. The surprising feature is that it was
written in 1983 and rather sadly
American. Why can't our programmers
produce comparable work?
Time for a quick "Crie de Coeur".
You may have noticed that Teacher's Pet
has not appeared every month recently.
The simple facts are that I ' m  n o t
receiving sufﬁcient new material (even
though the Editor does his best) to give
you new ideas. I would be grateful if all

work with our new software
service.
IT'S THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING.
You sit at the computer keyboard having
just ﬁnished a marathon typing session
entering one of  the superb programs
from Your Commodore. Your ﬁngers
reach for  the keyboard and press the
letters R ,  U  and N / .  You s it back
expectantly and.. nothing happens.
Well, I'm sure that we have all had
problem before now. When i t  does
happen it's a matter of spending hours
searching through the program for any
typing mistakes. No matter how long you
look or how many people help you, you
can usually guarantee that at least one
little bug slips through unnoticed.
Here, at Your Commodore, we pride
ourselves on the quality of listing that we
print. Unfortunately, this usually means
that they are also very long, thus taking
longer to type in and leaving more room
for errors. All o f  the listings in Your
Commodore are taken straight from a
printout o f  working programs, i t  is
therefore very unusual f or  errors t o
appear in the magazine.
Because of the length of our programs
we do get a large number of requests from
readers who would like us to put speciﬁc

Obviously this is very time consuming and
means that we can't spend as much time
working on the magazine as we would
like.
The
Your Commodore Software

rams for the C64 or C128 on disk or tape
published in Your Commodore. The cost
of a cassette is i4.00 and a disk will cost
16.00.
Unless otherwise stated all C64 and

None of the programs are protected
and we suggest that you make back up

All programs on the cassette will be

However, we cannot guarantee that all
programs will work correctly with this

recommend that before you use any of

Your commodore teams up
with Micronet to bring you 4
very special offer.
IF Y O U  O W N  A  COMMODORE
Communications modem you are no
doubt aware that you can use it to access
Prestel and Micronet. Before you can do
so you need to have the VIEWDATA
software that is available on Compunet
and your own account on Micronet
which costs E16.50.
Your Commodore has teamed up
with Micronet to give you your ﬁrst
quarter's subscription t o  Mic ronet
totally FREE.
Once you have your FREE subscrip-
tion to Micronet you will have the whole
of the services offered by Prestel and
Micronet at your disposal. You can
browse around the News pages o f
Prestel, send messages to friends who
have Prestel accounts, go on to one of
the chatlines and talk to people from all
over the country. In fact you have all
sorts of information at your ﬁngertips,
from train times to the latest sports
results.
Micronet is  usually just a  local
telephone call away, this means that
after six O'clock in the evening it will
cost you around 50p for an hour on the
system.
Once you start t o use Micronet,
which is a section of Prestel only open to
members of the Micronet 'club', you
will no doubt want to download some of
the software that is available onto your
own disk/tape. Before you can do this
you usually have t o  purchase t h e
Mustang software from Micronet at a
price of E5.00. We will give it to you
FREE. This software gives your computer
the ability to download software from
Micronet, be it a free game or a E20.00
wordprocessor.
The Your Commodore offer only
provides y o u  w i t h  f r e e  Mustang
software a n d  y our  ﬁr s t quarters
subscription. If you do buy anything
from the system you will of course have
to pay for it youself,

R e v i e w
Gordon Hamlett has been
giving his C64 some speech
therapy with the help of
Superior Software.
THINK OF ALL THE BAD NAMES YOU
have ever called your computer. Maybe
when your latest program has just
crashed for the umpteenth time or
when, after several hours of playing, you
have failed to beat your best score on
the latest mega-game by a measly 25
points. Certainly my machine has had to
suffer some decidedly unparliamentary
terms. And isn't it a relief to know that
the beast can't answer back?
Well, I'm afraid that I've got some
bad news for you. Using this latest utility
from Su p erio r Softw are, y o u r
Commodore cannot only answer you
back, but the speech is of such a quality
that you will even be able to understand
what it says to you!
Speech!, as t h e name suggests,
allows you to include speech in your
own programs. When you consider all
the vagaries of the English language,
with such potential problems as plough,
though, cough and tough, you will see
that this is no mean achievement. The
system works by dividing the different
sounds that groups of letters make into
49 different phonemes. For example,
consider the following four words; hard,
bat, mail and bare. All of them involve
the letter ''a" to give them their main
vowel sound and yet all four are totally
different from each other. In Speech!,
you would enter the vowel sounds as
HAARD, BAET. MAYL and BAIR. Most of
these unusual sounds are vowel sounds
but there are also a few special con-
sonant combinations such as "zh" to get
seizure rather than "z" to get zebra.
The authors claim that you can
generate an unlimited vocabulary by
using these phonemes so your ﬁrst task
is to type in the phrase that you are
interested in and see what the computer
throws back at you. The chances are that
it will sound either partially or nothing
like what you intended. Don't worry
though. The trick is to spell words
phonetically using phonemes rather
than spelling them normally. Thus
education might become "ehdyuw
kayshun". You soon become used to
typing in words this way and when you
play them back, they generally sound
reasonable and recognisable. Once you
have a phrase that is almost, but not
quite, you can start tweaking and ﬁne
tuning it. This might mean changing a
ﬁnal "s" into a "z" or shortening or
lengthening one of the vowel sounds.
Everyday conversation would b e
pretty boring if everything was spoken
on the same note with not intonation or
inﬂection in the voice and Speech!
allows you to play about with these
factors as well.
You can adjust the overall pitch of
THE GIFT
OF THE
e
the voice from reasonably high to very,
very low. Punctuation also affects
intonation. A question mark will raise
the pitch of the ﬁnal syllable whilst a full
stop will lower it.
The commands required to control
the speech are simplicity itself. •PITCH
and *SAY are the two main commands.
You can also adjust the emphasis placed
on each individual phoneme as you aim
for a more natural rendition of a word or
phrase. This is done via the • SPEAK
command and is likely to involve more
tweaking of your word. This seems to be
a more hit or miss affair than the *SAY
command. One of the phrases that I
was playing about with was "I am a
Dalek. Exterminate." When I  tried it
direct using *SAY, the ﬁrst sentence was
all right but needed some changes of
intonation whilst the second half was
ﬁne. When I changed to *SPEAK though,
"I am a Dalek" was excellent but the
program kept throwing out all my
attempts at "exterminate." Maybe I was
just using the wrong phonemes but it
was annoying when it sounded ﬁne
earlier.
The acid test f o r an y speech
synthesiser is how it actually sounds
and whether I understand it without any
undue effort. Speech! is excellent on
both counts, providing that you take the
time and trouble to make it so. Certainly,
it is great fun trying. As for what you
would use it for, I am not going to say too
much as it is the subject of a competition
included in the package to win a pair of
professional walkie-talkies. Personally, I
am going to set it up to say to the
mother-in-law, all the things that I never
had the courage to say myself.

COMMODORE
Keith Eyeions brings you an
insight into some little used
Basic commands on the
C64.
SO YO U THINK YOU KNO W ALL
about Commodore Basic V2? You may
assume that all it is is a few simple
GOT0s, PRINTS, FOR...NEXT loops and
IF...TH ENs, along with a mass of tedious
POKEs. But look again, for in the depths
of the Basic ROM several underused,
but highly  useful, statements and
functions lie hidden.
To s tart w it h ,  her e ar e s ome
commands simplifying and clarifying the
import job of printing and displaying
things on the screen. Many a user has
been bafﬂed and bemused, or  just
bored, by the tedious array of reverse
ﬁeld graphic characters that, when
included in PRINT statements, position
the cursor, change colour, and control
printing in many other ways. But these
confusing symbols can be replaced by
the following commands:
TAB
You might have thought that the 64 does
not have a TAB command, merely cursor
control symbols in PRINT statements.
Well, it does. At least, it does have half a
TAB command. Instead of requiring row
and column co-ordinates, as most Basics
do, Basic V2 uses only one number, in
the range zero to 255. I t  moves the
cursor the speciﬁed number of spaces
from the left-most space of the line that
the cursor is on. As a screen line is 40
spaces across, six full lines can b e
accessed. It is most useful for positioning
things in columns.
SPC
Examples:
PRINT TAB (20) "HELLO"
replaces the horrible:
PRINT "[RIGHT 20] HELLO"
PRINT TAB(190) "HELLO"
is the same as:
PRINT "[DOWN 4] [RIGHT 301 HELLO"
This function is similar t o TAB, but
instead o f  moving t h e  cursor t he
speciﬁed number of positions from the
left column, it moves the cursor from its
present position, This is very useful
when you have a PRINT statement with a
large number of spaces between items.
As well as being difﬁcult to count when
typing in a listing, they waste memory.
Replacing them with SPC neatens the
program, saves memory, and makes the
listing easier to understand at a glance.
Example;
PRINT "COMMODORE" SPC(29) "64"
replaces
PRINT ''COMMODORE [29 SPACES] 64"
CHRS
This function can be very useful in
programs, where it can replace control
symbols in PRINT statements. It prints
the character or control with the ASCII
value stated in brackets.
79
Example:
PRINT CHRS(155)
is the same as
PRINT "
Anyone trying to type in the latter
command would probably have to look
up the control symbol in the manual,
before discovering that it is obtained by
pressing the Commodore key and the
eight key.
Here is a list of the useful ASCII
codes:

To make your program really clear
and easily understandable at a glance,
set variables to the ASCII codes you want
to use, as below:
10 RED=28: BLUE=31: WHITE=5:
CLEAR=147: HOME=19
Then, later in your program, you can
see them in this way:
100 PRINT CHRS(RED)
POW))
This little known function gives the
position o f  the cursor, i n  columns
distance from the left of the screen. It
returns a value from zero to 79, but those
values from 40 to 79 mean the same as
zero to 39. The number in brackets has
no relevance (as in the funciton FRE(0))
but must be included.
Examples:
PRINT POS(0)
P=POS(0)
Next, here are a few general useful
commands that y ou may not know
about.

H e l p
Save Wi t h  En d  O f  Tape
Market
This command is very useful if you have
a cassette with several or many programs
in it. If you tell the computer to LOAD,
and give it a speciﬁc program name and
it fails to ﬁnd that program, it will carry
on trying to ﬁnd it indeﬁnitely, even
when it comes to the end of the tape.
Although t h e  auto-stop o n  t h e
Datasettee w ill s top t he tape, t he
computer will still think it is receiveing
data, and continue with a blank screen.
If however, you save the last program
on the tape in the format shown below,
it will put an end of tape market after it.
This means that, i f  t h e  situation
described above occurs, the computer
will halt the load as soon as the tape
ends, and give an indication on the
screen that the program has not been
found.
Example:
SAVE"PROGRAM NAME",1,2
Status
After the computer has completed an
input o r  output operation from an
external device, i t  sets the variable
STATUS (which can be abbreviated to
ST) to give an indication of the status of
the operation. I f  y ou enter *PRINT
STATUS' after  s witc hing o n  t h e
computer, '0' will be printed.
If, however, you do it after a load
error, or a ﬁle operation, you will ﬁnd it
prints a positive number. A  detailed
table giving the STATUS code values is
given on page 85 of the Programmers
Reference G uide, b u t  t h e  mos t
important values are those in which bits
4, 5 or 6 are set. Bit 5, after a cassette read
operation, indicates a checksum error,
while bit 4 indicates and unrecoverable
read error or mismatch. Bit 6 indicates
the end of a ﬁle.
STATUS can be used when dealing
with ﬁles, to ﬁnd out when the end of a
ﬁle is reached, by checking bit 6, and to
ﬁnd out whether a read operation is
successful, by checking bits 4 and 5.
Example:
IF STATUS AND 32 OR ST AND 16 THEN
PRINT "ERROR"
IF STATUS AND 64 THEN PRINT "END
OF FILE"
CLR
This does NOT clear the screen! It makes
available all possible memory, without
erasing any program i n  memory. I t
erases all variables, arrays, gosub return
addresses and loops, closes all ﬁles, and
resets the data pointer. It is useful in
direct mode after y ou have r un a
program, and want to free memory,
without erasing the program, for other
uses. It is also useful in a big program,
when you want to go on to something
different, for which you don't need all
the old memory consuming variables
that you had been using.
Wait
This statement stops t h e  program
operation unt il t h e  contents o f  a
speciﬁed memory location change to
match a speciﬁed bit pattern, usually in
response t o  an external event. The
computer takes the value stored in the
location given, and does a logical AND
operation with the next number in the
command. If a third number is given in
the WAIT command, then it is exclusive-
ORed w it h t h e  result o f  t he ﬁrst
calculation. If the ﬁnal result is positive,
then the program continues, if not, then
the process repeats.
Examples
10 POKE 198,0: WAIT 198,255
This clear the keyboard buffer, and
then waits f o r  location 198, which
contains the number of characters in the
buffer, to change from zero. This causes
the program t o  wait until a  key is
pressed, and is equivalent to
10 GET KM IF KES=" THEN 10
WAIT1,32,32
This waits for a key to be pressed on
the tape unit.
POKE 161,0: WAIT 161,8
This gives a pause of around 35
seconds. Location 161 is part of the three
bytes storage for the built in clock, and
stores units of 256 jifﬁes (60ths of  a
second). This example sets it to zero, and
then waits for the 8 bit to be set. To
change the length of the pause, change
the 8 to another one of the following
numbers: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 or 128. To
calculate the length of  the pause in
seconds, multiply the number by four.
Finally here are two useful space
saving commands.
ON.. GOTO/GOSUB
This statement is very useful if you have a
decision point in a program, where the
computer jumps to a different part of
the program, depending on the value of
a variable. For example, if you had a
point in a program where a menu of
options is displayed, and the computer
asks for you to choose by giving it a
number, t h e  computer might then
process this with the following lines:
100 IF N=1 THEN 200
110 IF N=2 THEN 250
120 IF N=3 THEN 475
130 IF N=4 THEN 100
140 IF N=5 THEN 900
All this can be replaced by:
100 ON N GOTO 200,250,475,100,900
All the computer does is jump to the
Nth address in the list following the ON
GOTO or  GOSUB command. I f  the
value of N is zero, or greater than the
number o f  addresses lis ted, t h e
computer ignores  t h e  c ommand.
Negative values give an illegal quantity
error.
DEF FN
This is  very useful when the same
complicated calculation is done several
times in one program, and is duplicated
unnecessarily. It deﬁnes a function as
any mathematical formula (e.g. X=3*X).
It has a  name, like any variable,
consisting of one of two letters.
Examples
10 DEE FNA(X)=X*3
sets up function A to multiply a number
by three.
50 PRINT FNA(7)
calls this function, and prints the value
21. It uses the number seven in the
function, as X, and multiplies it by three.
Try changing the function to do other
things, and put different numbers in
place of the seven. The X in the DEF FN is
unimportant and could be any variable,
it is merely what the computer labels the
number (in this case seven that you give
it when you use the function, and it does
not affect the actual variable X if you are
using it.
Some functions are independent of
the value given in brackets, as in this
case.
10 DEF FNA(X)=INT(RND(1)*10)+1
50 PRINT FNA(0)
This pr ints  a  r andom number
between one and 10, and, as X is not
involved in the calculation, it does not
matter what number you put in brackets
when you use the function.
This function is, in  fact, a good
example of how you can use functions to
save space. Having deﬁned it, all you
need to do to get a random number is:
R = INA(0) which is much simpler than
R = INT(RND(1)*10)+1
Finally
I h o p e  that y o u  w ill ﬁn d  these
commands useful and that what I have
written has given yoiu a slightly better
idea of what Basic can do.
If you have any ideas for advice or
hints that may  beneﬁt other Your
Commodore readers then please send

Add a new language to your
C64 with this program by
Mycroftt Appleby.
AS WE ALL KNOW THE COMMODORE
64 is a wonderful little machine. the only
thing that lets it down is the lack of a
decent language f o r  it .  T he Basic
supplied with the machine is so out-
dated tht it has no graphics, no sound
and no other 'fancy commands.
I have therefore produced a version
of PILO T t h a t  w i l l  r u n  o n  t h e
Commodore that comes complete with
lots of new commands. If you have never
come across PILOT before this is what
the name stands for:
Programmed, Instruction, Learning or
Teaching language.
As the name suggests PILOT is used
very widely in educational applications,
though this  version i s  very muc h
expanded for most others,
The original program was written in
Basic and was obviously quite slow. The
version presented here was compiled
using the BLITZ compiler, making it a
little faster_
In this issue of Your Commodore is
the actual program. It is presented as a
small Basic move program and a series of
Basic loaders.
After entering and SAVEing a ll
programs, LO AD the BASIC MOVE
program and RUN it. Next LOAD the
BASIC LOAD 1 program and RUN it, the
LOADERS will do the rest. When the
programs have ﬁnished they will save
the program PILOT on to your disk or
tape, this is the program that you should
LOAD and RUN in future.
Before you can use PILOT you should
LOAD and run the PILOT M/C program.
Once you have done this LOAD and
RUN PILOT,
Also in this issue are the instructions
for using the language, in  a  future
edition I will give a few demo programs
to help you on your way.
PILOT, a Short Introduction
Pilot was ﬁrst implemented on main-
frame computers many years ago. This
version was known as CORE PILOT and
had very few instructions, no provision
for editing, and no numerical capability
at all. T he nex t upgrade saw t he
introduction o f  numerical handling,
more than one variable, and some
editing functions, this was called COM-
MON PILOT. Finally the most recent
introduction was  PILOT 77 whic h
introduced arrays, (unction handling,
and lots more.
The present form you see is very
altered to ﬁt a micro and to utilise its
facilities, and as such falls somewhere
between COMMON PILOT and PILOT
77. So now you are the owner of MICRO
PILOT for the Commodore 64.
A lot of extensions have been made
for the introduction of graphics, sound,
logical structures, cassette, and a screen
editor, but the interpreter is still very
much a PILOT interpreter. Existing Pilot
programmers should ﬁnd themselves at
home with it, while Basic programmers
will ﬁnd i t  is  a  new and pleasing
experience.
There follows a description of the
instructions and errors etc. The way a
program is written. edited,and run isstill
very much in  the Basic tradition so
programming in PILOT is not as difﬁcult
as it ﬁrst may seem.
MICRO PILOT V6.4
Command Set
These commands may only be used in
command mode, i.e. not in a PILOT
program when it is running but in the
general housekeeping of the program,
editing, a n d  ex amination o f  t h e
program. Parameters may be passed to
these commands and their  correct
formatting is shown under the correct
command description. Most commands
need only their ﬁrst two letters entered
e.g. RU for RUN will sufﬁce, but for EXIT,
NEW, and RESET all the letters need to
be typed due to their destructive nature
and the dire consequences should they
be entered in error.
Display and Execution
Commands
These are used to execute the pilot
program and to examine the program's
contents,
RUN -  Clears all variables, stacks, and
starts execution of PILOT program from
the ﬁrst line.
LIST -  Displays PILOT program lines
speciﬁed, defaults to ﬁrst and last lines.
i.e.
LIST - will display all program lines
LIST 30 - will display line 30
LIST -100 - will display all lines up to line
100
LIST 60- - will display all lines from 60
onwards
LIST 70-120 - will display all lines from 70
82
to 120 inclusive.
The listing may be slowed down by
pressing the 'RVS' key or halted with the
'STOP' key.
PUST -  Same as list but output i5 to
printer instead of screen.
Programming Aids and
Program Interrogation
Commands
These enable rapid debugging of any
PILOT program by  use o f  variable,
program, and statement investigation to
trace, locate, and correct an error.
DUMP - Will display a table of current
variable names in use and their values.
LABELS - Will display all PILOT program
lines, with line numbers, that contain
labels.
FIND - Will hunt for a speciﬁed string
through a PILOT program and display all
the lines that contain it. i.e. FIND
"FRED" will hunt for the string FRED_
REPLACE -  Will hunt through a PILOT
program f o r  a  speciﬁed string and
replace each occurrence o f  i t  with
another speciﬁed string. i.e. REPLACE
"FRED" WITH "BASIL" will replace each
occurrence of FRED in a PILOT program
with BASIL,
FREE - Displays the number of free bytes
left for access by PILOT programs.
AUTO -  Star ts  a u t o ma t ic  l i n e
numbering. On each carriage return a
new line number is displayed. If the line
is empty the automatic line numbering
stops. Lines are numbered in increments
of 10. Start line number defaults to 10,
i.e. AUT O  7 0  w ill start auto line
numbering from line 70 in increments of
10. AUTO will start numbering from 10
in 10s.
CONTINUE -  Restarts PILOT program
after the 'STOP' key has been pressed or
a PILOT break (BO instruction has
occurred.
Operating System Commands
These commands are involved in the
reinitialisation of the PILOT interpreter,
the Basic system, a n d  t h e  PILOT
program.
EXIT -  Ends operation of PILOT inter-
preter and returns to Basic with the
message 'BASIC OK'.
RESET - Total reset of pilot interpreter,
total reseting of all system variables,
restarts interpreter program from start.
NEW -  Clears all variables, stacks, and
the current pilot program.

C 6 4  L a n g u a g e
Load and Save Commands
These commands allow the user to store
and recall programs on tape.
LOAD -  This command is similar in
operation to that of the Basic interpreter
in normal operation except that when
the program is  being loaded i t  is
displayed on the screen.
SAVE - This is also similar to Basic except
that the program is listed on the screen
as it is saved.
VERIFY - This is similar to Basic except
that the program is listed on the screen
as it is being checked. If the program on
tape differs to that in the computer's
memory then the message "PROGRAM
ERROR" is displayed.
APPEND -  This is a command that is
similar to 'LOAD' except that the current
program in memory is not erased and
the program to be appended is tagged
on to the end oft he existing program. To
append a program there must already be
a program in memory to append it to.
RUN -  Not really a command but a
security device in this case. It can only be
used in  program mode as the only
instruction on the ﬁrst line of a program.
When a program has this as its ﬁrst line it
will not list when loading, if stopped
with the stop key the system will reset,
and when loading is completed the
program will automatically run.
MICRO PILOT V6.4
Instruction Set
These instructions can be used in both
PROGRAM and CO MMAND mode.
Program mode is  during the actual
execution o f  the PILOT program. In
command mode the execution of the
instructions i s  t h e  s ame a s  f o r
commands.
Instructions are composed of a single
letter followed by a colon the data after
that c o lo n  i s  dependent o n  t h e
instruction. The only exceptions to this
rule are labels, procedure deﬁnitions,
procedure calls, and Y/N conditional
ﬂags (all explained later).
Output Instructions
These instructions allow the output of
data or text to the screen or external
device (i.e. printer, sound generator).
T: Ty pe. This will display the text
following the instruction on the
screen. Starting and terminating
quotes are not needed. If the text
string ends with a semi-colon ';'
then the line feed is suppressed and
the next line printed will be on the
same l i n e .  Va r ia b le  names
embedded in the text will be con-
verted i n t o  t h e ir  values, and
reincorporated into the text.
Format
lots of text
T: lots more text;
P: Pr int. This is the same as •T:', except
output is to the printer and not to
the screen.
Format
P: lots of text
P: lots more text;
Input Instructions
These allow the input of data or text
from the keyboard/screen editor.
A: Accept input. Input a  string o f
characters into the named variable
following the instruction, with a
prompt of " .  The Screen editor
will stop operate. If the variable
name ends with a semi-colon then
the PILOI program will not end
with nothing being entered, but
jusdt re-displays the prompt and
tries again to get an answer. If the
variable n a m e  e n d s  i n  a n
exclamation mark 'I' (or next to a
semi-colon s ee abov e), t h e n
prompt and answer are directed to
the printer for hard copy record of
dialog between pilot program and
user.
Format
A:VARNAMES
A: VARNAMES;
A:VARNAMESI;
I: I n p u t .  This will get a  character
directly from the keyboard and
assign it to the named variable. If no
key is pressed then the variable
becomes empty. • If the variable
name ends in a semi-colon then the
pilot program waits until a key is
pressed before continuing.
Format
I :VARNAMES
I:VARNAMES;
Branch and Jump
Instructions
These ins truc tions  inter r upt t h e
program ﬂow and direct it to another
point in the program.
J: J ump. Jumps to the named label or
line number. Jumping t o  lin e
numbers is not recommended due
to them changing whenever a
program is  edited, though they
have a speed advantage, and when a
program has been completed the
command 'LABELS' can be used in
conjunction w it h  'REPLACE' t o
convert all labels t o  their line
number equivalents.
Format
1:*label
J:30
Label. This sign indicates a label and
needs n o  colon after it. When
encountered in the normal running
of a  program this instruction is
ignored, but when a ins tr uc tion
is executed the interpreter will
search through the program until
the named label is  found and
program execution w ill recom-
mence from the line following the
label.
Format

Maths and String
Manipulation Instructions
These allow a certain amount of maths
and string manipulation of variables and
numbers.
C: Calculate. This  w ill mak e o n e
variable equal t o  either a) The
contents of the string variable after
any manipulation or concatination
has taken place, or b) The mathe-
matical result of two variables or
numbers, operated on by
ie. resultS=ﬁrstS4-secondS makes the
value of result$ equal to the sum of
the values of the variables ﬁrstS and
secondS_
Format-
CVAR1S---VAR2$=VAR3S -  Mak e
the value of varlS equal to the sum
of the values of var.3$ and yarn.
C:VAR1SVAR2S-4 -  Mak e t h e
value of var
var2S minus 4.
C:VAR1S=5/VAR2S -  Mak e t he
value of varlS equal to 5 divided by
the value of var—S.
CNAR1S,-
vart$ equal to 5 multiplied by 9.
CFULLNA.MES=FIRSTNAMES SEC-
ONDNAME$ - Makes the value of
full names equal to the value of ﬁrst-
nameS a space and then the value of
secondname$, i.e. if  ﬁrsinameS-
'Mycroftt' and secondnameS=Ap-
pleby% then the value of fullnameS
would be 'Mycroftt Appleby'.
E: Execute. This instruction takes the
contents of a variable and treats it as
a PILOT program line. This means it
can be used for arrays and other
such like as well as a form of user
deﬁned instruction. T he string
following the instruction may be a
mixture of variables and ordinary
text.
i.e. N S  where aS=V*LABEL' will
execute a ins tr uc tion and jump
to the label "'LABEL'.
Format
E:instruction$
Termination Instructions
These occur in a PILOT program when-
ever the running of the program needs
to b e  interrupted and a  return t o
command mode made.
S: Stop. Ends execution o f  PILOT
program, returns t o  command
mode, and displays 'READY.' promt.
Format-
S:
B: B r e a k .  Su s p e n d s  p r o g r a m
execution, saves current program
line, and displays where program
was broken. Functions i n  a n
identical way t o the 'STOP' key
being pressed. The program can be
restarted from the next line by the
use of the 'CONTINUE' command.
Format-
B:

Recursive Instructions
These enable the repeated operation of
a set of instructions.
L: Loop. This is followed by a numeric
parameter, either a variable or a
number. It indicates the number of
loops to be made_ The end of the
loop set of instructions is given by
the ' U : '  command (see below).
Loops may be nested up to 10 deep
with return address and value of the
loop variable saved on the stack.
10 1_15
20 T:hello
30 T:said
40 T:FRED
50 U:
Will print 'hello said FRED on the
screen 5 times
Format
L:5
LAS
U: Until. This deﬁnes the end of the
loop. When a loop is in operation
and 'U:' is encountered, the para-
meter after the last 1:instruction is
decremented, and if still positive
execution is recommenced at the
line following the loop instruction_
If. however, the result is zero then
the loop is  ﬁnished, the loop
information is removed from the
stack, and program execution
continues from the next line.
Format- U:
Variable Handling
Instructions
These a r e  associated w i t h  t h e
manipulation o f  variables and their
relative values.
W: Wipe variable. This will erase any
variable name and value from the
variable list except TIMES.
Format-
VA RN AMES
N: N e w  variable list. This erases all
variable names and values from
variable list except TIMES
Format-
N:

name in the variable list and assigns
it a value. More than one variable
may be cited in the line, but all must
be separated by  a colon A l l
variable values giv en mus t b e
included in quotation marks.
Format-
D:VAR1S="vall"NAR2S="val2"
M: Matc h variable w it h  lis t. This
instruction is  the very base o f
PILOT's tex t manipulation and
comparative functions. This  in -
struction will take a named variable
and compare its value with a list in
one o f  tw o possible ways. The
outcome of this match will set a ﬂag
to either 'Y' or  'N' (yes or  no)
depending, this is called the match
ﬂag. This can be used to operate an
instruction conditionally by putting
either a Y or a N between the in-
struction letter and the colon i.e.
•TY:fred' will only type 'fred' if the
match ﬂag is Y, and 'TN:wrong' will
type 'wrong' if the match ﬂag is N.
The two functions are as follows a)
The 'AND' match, denoted by a
sign between the variable name and
the list, this will only set the match
ﬂag to 'Y' if ALL the items in the list
are contained in the variable value,
otherwise it is set to 'N'. b) The 'OR'
match, denoted b y  a  V '  sign
between the variable name and the
list, this will set the match ﬂag to 'Y'
if any of the members of the list are
contained i n  the variable value,
otherwise it is set to 'N'. There can
only be a maximum of 25 items in
the list.
Format ('or' matches) -
M:ANSWFRS/Y,YES,y,yes. Will set
the match ﬂag to Y if either Y,yes,y,
or yes are contained in the value of
ANSWERS,
Format ('and' matches) -
M:ENGLANDS+ london, capital,
england. Will set the match ﬂag to Y
if london, capital, and england are
ALL c ontained t h e  v ar iable
ENGLANDS.
Procedure Deﬁning and
Calling
Procedures are sections of program that
work much like a subroutine in Basic.
Procedures may have other procedures
from within them and these may be
nested up to 10 deep.
Deﬁning a procedure is done with
square brackets T h e  open bracket
followed b y  t h e  procedure na- te
denotes the start of the procedure, and a
closed bracket following t h e  las t
instruction of the procedure denotes
the end of the procedure i.e.
The procedure 'FRED' that prints the
word 'fred' on the screen 5 times can be
deﬁned as follows.
10 [FRED
20 L:5
30 T:FRED
40 1.1:1
If that program were to be run as it
stands nothing would happen as the
interpreter will ignore any procedure it
comes across unless it is properly called.
A procedure is called from within a
program much lik e a  user deﬁned
instruction o r  command b y  simply
having the procedure name as the
program line. Procedures may not be
called fr om command mode as this
would lead to confusion with ordinary
commands i.e.
To call the procedure 'FRED' 10 times
the following addition to the program is
made.
50 L:10
60 FRED
70 U;
80 S:
Line 6 0 is  t he lin e  that calls t he
procedure. When this is encountered
execution commences of the procedure
'FRED' and when the end bracket 'I' end
of procedure i s  found execution
recommences at line 70.
Pilot Graphics Facilities
These instructions enable the creation
and manipulation of graphic shapes on
the screen. These involve the use of text
and a pixel (point) graphics system. The
pixel system operates on a matrix of BO
horizontal points and 50 vertical points.
Text can also be displayed on the screen
concurrently with the pixel graphics,
block graphics are treated the same way
as text. Text always has the higher
priority, so text can be displayed on a
pixel graphic shape, but a shape being
drawn over text will only be drawn in
gaps between words or blank areas of
screen. All the display methods are done
by using the 'G:' instruction and there
are three modes of graphic display as
follows.
Mode 1
G: Followed by a string in quotes. This
functions identically to 'T:' except the
text is enclosed in quotes, these are not
printed and only serve to allow the use
of in text cursor control and colour
change functions. The semicolon, if
used. must be outside the quotes.
Format G :" LO T S OF TEXT"
G:"LOTS MORE TEXT";
Mode 2
G: Followed by  two co-ordinates, in
brackets, separated by a comma. This
can then be followed by  a string in
quotes as  above. T he co-ordinates
deﬁne the x/y position that the printing
of the tex t starts from. These c o-
ordinates can be variables or constants,
The x and y values must not excede 39
horizontally, and 24 vertically.
Format G:(0,20)"LOTS OF TEXT"
G: (XS,YS)"LOTS MORE TEXT"
Mode 3
This is the most complex and important
graphics mode as it controls the pixel
graphics.
The G: instruction is followed by a
worded instruction which has its own
parameters following it. Variables or
constants may be used. The parameters
refer to positions, angles. and directions
on the screen. Two methods are used,
absolute plotting, and relative plotting.
The absolute system treats the screen as
a Cartesian grid of zero to 79 on the x axis
and zero to 49 on the y axis, and the
84

C 9 4  L a n g u a g e
origin at the bottom left hand corner of
the screen. All points and distances are
taken from the position of the origin.
The relative system is more vector based
and uses the last point plotted as its
reference point.
The last point plotted is known as the
graphics cursor position or the 'turtle'.
This is because the graphics cursor is
considered as an invisible turtle walking
around the screen leaving or rubbing
out a trail behind him. This approach
means that the system is easier to Under-
stand for children. This is why it is known
as 'TURTLE' graphics. Most of the kei nal
graphics functions (i.e. plotting a point,
or drawing a line between two points)
are written in 6502 assembly language
machine code, and are thus very fast.
Mode 3 Instructions
TEXT -  Sets text mode. Replaces the
block graphics with lower case letters
i.e. G:TEXT
GRAPHICS -  Sets graphics mode.
Replaces lower case letters with block
graphics i.e. G:GRAPHICS
PLOT - Sets (turns on) a pixel in absolute
co-ordinates or at current turtle position
in current ink colour. If co-ordinates are
given t h e  turtle will mov e t o  that
position i.e.
G:PLOT(10,20) -  Sets a point at co-
ordinates 10,20.
G: PLOT - Sets a point at current turtle
pos it ion.
UNPLOT -  Identical to PLOT except it
will reset (turn off) a pixel at the location
speciﬁed. Syntax and options are the
same as for PLOT i.e. G:LINPLOT(X$,Y$)
TURN - This sets the turtle direction to a
set number of degrees, increments the
angle, or  decrements the angle. This
assumes a circle of 360 degrees going
clockwise around a circle, with 0  and
360 degrees being at 12 o'clock i.e.
G:TUR N TO 30- Sets the turtle direction
to 30 degrees.
G;TURN - 5  -  Decrements the turtle
direction by 5 degrees.
G:TURN ANGLES -  Increments the
turtle angle by the value of the variable
'ANGLES'.
DRAW -  Will draw a line of pixels
between two points in the current ink
colour. The last point plotted becomes
the new turtle position. The absolute
mode needs four parameters, start x and
y co-ordinates, and end x and y co-
ordinates. The relative mode can draw
to a speciﬁed point, relative t o the
origin, from the current turtle position,
or from the current turtle position a
certain number of pixels in the current
turtle direction. i.e. it makes the turtle
walk to a point leaving a trail of walks a
certain distance leaving a trail, in a
predeﬁned direction i.e.
G:DRAW (0,0) TO (79,49) - Will draw a
line of pixels from co-ordinates 0,0 to
79,49.
G:DRAW TO (10,10) -  Will 'walk' the
turtle from wherever it is to co-ordinates
10,10 leaving a trail.
C:DRAW 5 -  Will 'walk' the turtle 5
pixels in the current turtle direction
leaving a trail.
UNDRAW -  Erases a line instead of
drawing it, Identical syntax and options
as DRAW i.e. G:UNDRAW (X1$,Y1S) TO
(X2$,Y2S)
CIRCLE -  Draw a  circle o r  arc o f
speciﬁed radius, position , a nd arc length
(in degrees), in the current ink Colour.
Parameters that are passed in relative
and absolute mode are the start and end
arc position, i.e. 0 and 360 would draw a
c
circle etc, and the radius. For absolute
operation t h e  centre o f  the circle
position must be speciﬁed, whilst for
relative operation the centre is taken to
be the current turtle position. The turtle
moves to the ﬁnal point plotted i.e.
G:C1RCLE (ARCSTARTS.ARCENDS) AT
(XPOS$,YPOS$) RADIUSS - Will draw a
circle of radius equal to the value of
variable RAD1US$, a t  co-ordinates
XPOS$ a n d  YPO S$, a n d  f r o m
ARCSTART$ t o  ARCEND$ degrees
around the circle.
G:CIRCLE (90,270)AT10 - Draws a semi-
circle o f  radius 10 at current turtle
position.
G:CIRCLE A T  (10,10)5 -  Draws a
complete circle o f  radius 5  at c o-
ordinates 10,10.
UNCIRCLE - Is the same as circle except
a circle or arc is erased. Options and
syntax the same i.e.
G:UNCIRCLE (0,360) AT (40,25) 10
RESET -  Sets turtle position t o  the
absolute origin, sets direction to north,
and 'homes' text cursor t o top left
corner. N o  parameters passed i.e.
G:RESET
MOVE - Will move the position of the
turtle to an absolute position on the
screen, or a speciﬁed number of pixels
in the current turtle direction. Similar in
action to 'DRAW X$' and 'DRAW TO X$'
i.e.
G:MOVE TO  (XS,Y$) W i l l  set the
current turtle position to the values of
variables X$ and Y$.
G:MOVE 5- Will move the turtle 5 pixels
in the turtle direction.
INK - This changes the ink colour to the
parameter that follows. All subsequent
printing and ploting is done in this
colour until it is changed. The ink colour
can also be changed by  the normal
means i.e. using the keys 1 to 9.
G:INK 1 -  Will make all printing and
plotting in white.
BORDER - This will change the border
colour to the parameter that follows the
instruction i.e.
G : B
hla k.
PAPER This sets the background colour
to the parameter following the instruc-
tion i.e.
G:PAPER 2 W ill  make the background
or paper colour red.
LINE - This command is similar to DRAW
and has all the same parameters and
85
functions, except one extra parameter
has been added to enable the drawing of
dotted lines. This is a number between 0
and 255 and when converted to binary it
will show what pattern will be drawn,
where a 0 is a space and a 1 is a dot i.e.
G:LINE1(X1$,Y1S)TO(X2S,Y2$) -  Will
draw dots widely spaced.
G:LINE254(X1S,Y1S)TO(X2S,Y2$) -  Will
draw long dashes with small spaces
between.
Sprite Graphics Under Pilot
The G:SPR1TE instruction is used t o
deﬁne and manipulate sprites. The in-
structions is followed by the number of
the sprite that you want to deal with,
then the data to indicate what is to
happen to that particular sprite.
= - This will deﬁne a sprite. Only sprites
0,1,2 can have their shapes deﬁned but
the shapes are repeated for the other
sprites. e.g. sprite 0,3,6:1,4,7:2,5 are
identical.
The equals sign is followed by a line
of 24 dots (shifted 'Q's) o r  spaces
enclosed in brackets. This deﬁnes the
ﬁrst line of the sprite, where a dot indi-
cates a dot on the sprite and a space
indicates a blank. There must be 20 more
lines o f  24 characters enclosed i n
brackets to deﬁne the other 20 lines of
the sprite i.e. to deﬁne sprite 0 as a box
shape the following program can be
used.

the position indicated by the x and y co-
ordinates. The grid the sprites are on is 0
to 320 horizontally and 0 to 200 vertically
all absolute co-ordinates and the origin
is the top left hand corner i.e.
G:SPRITE 3 (150,190) - Would set sprite 3
to the position 150,190.
COLOUR - This will set the colour of the
indicated sprite i.e.
G:SPRITE 2 COLOUR 0 -  Will set the
colour of sprite 2 to black.

I
EXPANDX -  This doubles the width of
the indicated sprite if it has not already
been expanded i.e.
G:SPRITE 5 EXPANDX - Will double the
width of sprite 5.
CONTRACTX - This will halve the width
of the indicated sprite if it has been
expanded i.e.
G:SPRITE 7 CONTRACTX -  Will halve
the width of sprite 7.
EXPANDY -  Operates the same as
expandx except it doubles the height i.e.
G:SPRITE 6 EXPAND'? - Will double the
height of sprite 6.
CONTRACTY -  Operates the same as
contractx except it halves the height i.e.
G:SPRITE 0 CONTRACTY -  Will halve
the width of sprite O.
Please see the Commodore 64 user
guide for further details about sprites
and graphics.
PILOT Variables
There can be up to 25 variables, each
with UNIQUE names up to any length
with a l l  characters signiﬁcant. An y
characters may be used in the name. A
dollar sign m u s t  be the ﬁnal character
of the name to indicate that it is a
variable. Variable values can be either
numeric or string, which one is depen-
dant upon the context in which it is
used.
Numeric Variables
I hese are to eight signiﬁcant digits, full
ﬂoating point. Strings have a numeric
value of zero '0'. Scientiﬁc notation is
not supported.
String Variables
These variables can have string lengths
up to 255, of any characters. Numbers
have a string value equal to it, i.e. 25.36=
25.36.
Time Variable
This is a system variable which holds the
current time in HHMMSS format. It
starts up at 000000 when the machine is
switched on, and will reset at 235959. The
value can be operated on at any time as a
normal variable, but if deﬁned it must be
a valid value in the above format.
Sub Stringing
The inclusion of two bracketed numbers
after the variable name takes only part of
the value. The ﬁrst number indicates the
ﬁrst character to be considered, and the
second number is the number of charac-
ters t o  b e  u s e d  i . e .  W h e r e
NAMES="MYCROFTT DAVID APPLEBY",
NAME$(9,5) will equal "DAVID".
PILOT Error Messages
The error messages inform the user that
Instruction Errors
there is a mistake in the program, or an
unpredicted event in the program has
arise& There are three kinds of error
messages command, instruction, and
both. Instruction errors suspend the
programs execution (as i n  the '13:'
instruction), display the message and
indicate the line that the error occured
in. The continue command will recom-
mend program execution.
Example of instruction error -  'LABEL
NOT FOUND ERROR ? IN LINE 30'.
Example o f  command error -  'FILE
NAME TOO LONG ERROR ?'.
TOO MANY VARIABLES. This happens
when an attempt is made to deﬁne more
than 25 variables.
NO SUCH VARIABLE. This occurs when
an attempt is made to access a variable
that has not been deﬁned.
LABEL NOT FOUND. When a jump to a
label has been made and the label does
not exist, this error message is displayed.
T o o  MANY  MATCHES. Used in con-
junction with the match '1\
tion, where there is more than 15 items
in the match list,
PARAMETER O UT OF RANGE. Means
that a number or variable has been used
which is outside the acceptable range of
the parameter in question.
DIVISION BY ZERO, Used in conjunc-
tion with the calculate 'C:' instruction,
where, in a division calculation, the
denominator of the equation is equal to
zero.
SPRITE. An error has occured in deﬁning
or manipulating a sprite.
PROCEDURE END WITHOUT START.
This happens when the interpreter
encounters t h e  ' I '  e n d  procedure
symbol without ev er starting that
procedure.
PROCEDURE NOT FOUND. A call was
made to a non-existent procedure.
TOO MANY  PROCEDURES. Only 10
nested calls to procedures are allowed.
TOO MANY  LOOPS. An attempt has
been made to next more than 10 loops.
Combined Instruction and
Command Errors
SYNTAX. This happens when a spelling
mistake occurs in  a command or  a
program, or an incorrect command or
instruction is encountered, Also it will
arise when the correct format is not
adhered too, although spaces can be
included at various points to aid the
reading of the program.
OUT O F  M E M O R Y .  W h e n t  h e
computer runs out of memory storage
for the program, variables, or to execute
any k in d  o f  memor y  consuming
operation. Or there are more than 400
program lines.
Command Errors
FILE NAME TOO LONG. File names can
86
be up to 16 characters long, excess of this
produces this error.
PROGRAM. After a DVERIFY command
if the program veriﬁed is not the same as
the one in memory a program error
occurs.
CONTINUE. This happens i f  after a
CONTINUE command is executed and it
is not possible to continue.
APPEND. I f  a APPEND command is
executed and there is  not program
already residing in memory.

A full screen editor is implemented,
identical to the normal Basic one. This
means that any program line can be
edited by just moving the 'cursor' to the
relevant piece of code and overtyping,
or using the insert or delete keys to
modify t h e  line. A  repeat k ey  is
supported, so that if any key is held
down for more than half a second it will
repeat at a rate of about 12 characters a
second.
All lines of pilot programs must have
a unique line number. If the number is
not unique then it will replace the other
line, Programs always start with the
lowest line number ﬁrst and progress in
10s, lines may be inserted between other
lines b y  choosing a  lin e  number
between the two i.e. line number 15
would be inserted between lines 10 and
20. After such alterations the lines are
renumbered in 10s,

COMMODORE LISTINGS ARE RATHER
well known for the horrible little black
blobs that always abound. Unfortunately
the graphics characters which are used to
represent graphic and control characters
do not reproduce very well and they are
also difﬁcult to ﬁnd on the Commodore
keyboard.
In future all control and graphics
commands will be replaced by a mnemonic
within square brackets. This mnemonic is
not typed out as printed in the magazine
but rather the corresponding key or keys
on the keyboard are pressed. For example
[RIGHT] means press the cursor right key,
you do not type in [RIGHT]. All of the
keywords, what keys to press and how
they are shown on the screen are shown
below.
Any character that is accessed by pressing
shift and a  letter will be printed as
[Sletter].
[SA] s hift and A

Any character that is  accessed by
pressing the Commodore key and a letter

The Essential Package
Over there they call it Swift-Calc: over here
we just call it Swift, but whatever you call
it, it's the most affordable and easy-to-use
professional quality Spreadsheet around!
The Americans have voted with their
wallets and made Swift one of the top ten
Home Management programs, according
to the highly respected Billboard chart, But
its British. written by Dave Middleton of
Metamorphosis Developments, and
published in the UK by Audiogenic
Software.
Swift Spreadsheet is the essential ﬁnancial
modelling package. Use it in business, at
home, or in your club or society to help you
in budgetting. costing. quotations,
household ﬁnancial planning, or any task
where the manipulation of ﬁgures is
involved.
Swift will prove indispensable in
forecasting and decision-making due to its
'What If' capabilities - it can show you
instantly how results are affected when you
change one or more of the contributory
factors.
Even if you haven't used a Spreadsheet
before, you will soon be able to harness
the power of Swift to your own special
requirements,
