Dedication
To my husband for always listening, no matter how long my stories take. And
to Safra, my guiding light.   —Holly
To Tsafi, my better half, who has been extremely patient and supportive with
a hectic year of travel and work and letting many chapters of this book join
us on vacations and weekends.   —Denise
Authors’ Acknowledgments
This book would not be possible without the help and support of many, many
people. Our colleagues at SAP were very generous with their time and
research materials, providing us with interviews, research materials, and
even whole sections revised or written in their hand.
Special thanks are due to Gary Dickhart, who couldn’t stop writing (we’re
waiting for your GRC book, Gary), David Milam and Dave Anderson, who
helped us greatly improve our chapter on risk management (Chapter 2). Mark
Crofton made important contributions to the financial compliance chapters
in Part II. Marina Simonians and David Ahrens provided tremendous support
for Part III, “Going Green.” Paul Pessutti helped us with interviews, reviews,
and revisions in the very complex area of global trade (Chapter 8), as well as
our related Part of Ten (Chapter 17). Christian Berg, who is both a colleague
and an expert in the area of sustainability, shaped Chapter 14. We would also
like to thank Karan Dhillon for his excellent interview and research materials;
his input can be seen throughout the book, as can the influence of Bob
Crochetiere, whose interview was also formative. We also extend our appreci-
ation to the following people who helped us in bringing this book together:
Nenshad Bardoliwalla, Wolfgang Bock, Ben Cesar, Lee Dittmar, Ravi Gill,
Marko Langes, Melissa Lea, Joe Miles, Phil Morin, Jim Mullen, Tom Neacy,
Barry Nemmers, Eric Solberg, Axel Streichardt, and Greg Wynne. Thank you
for the time you spent working with us, despite very hectic schedules.
We’d like to thank the writers at Evolved Media: Dan Woods, Deb Cameron,
Charlotte Otter, D. Foy O’Brien, James Buchanan, Kermit Pattison, David
Penick, and Justin Jouvenal.
We would also like to extend our sincere thanks to the great people at Wiley,
especially Katie Feltman, Beth Taylor, and Linda Morris, for all their hard
work, dedication, and perceptive editing.

Introduction
G
RC is an acronym that may be Greek to the uninitiated, but chances are
if you picked up this book, you are at least interested in knowing what
it means. And even if not everyone knows what GRC means, the concepts
involved are ones that everyone understands.
The G is governance. In short, this means taking care of business, making sure
that things are done according to your standards (and those of the ever-
present regulators, not to mention your company’s Board of Directors). It
also means setting forth clearly your expectations of what should be done so
that everyone is on the same page with regard to how your company is run.
The R is risk. Everything we do involves an element of risk. When it comes to
running across freeways or playing with matches, it’s pretty clear that certain
risks are just not to be taken. When it comes to business, however, risk
becomes a way to help you both protect value (what you have) and create
value (by strategically expanding your business or adding new products and
services). 
The C is what everyone knows about — compliance with the many laws and
directives affecting businesses (and citizens) today. One of the authors of this
book would also like to extend that C to controls, meaning that you put certain
controls in place to ensure that compliance is happening. This might mean
monitoring your factory’s emissions or ensuring that your import and export
papers are in order. Or it might just simply mean that the same person is not
creating vendors and cutting checks to her brother-in-law Frank on the sly.
The C relates to laws as familiar as Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) or as emergent as
Europe’s REACH (if we’ve got you on that one, see Chapter 12).
But when you put it all together, GRC turns out to be not just what you have
to do to take care of business, but a paradigm to help you grow your business
in the best possible way and — even more — to figure out what that way is.
About This Book
When we decided to write a book about GRC, we thought about writing a book
for experts, a thought-leadership book. And although this book is no slouch
in the area of thought-leadership (if we do say so ourselves), we decided 
that what was needed the most was a way to start the conversation about
GRC. What are you doing, in terms of governance, risk, and compliance?
What should you be doing? And do you know that it’s a much bigger picture

than you realize, encompassing areas like sustainability and dovetailing very
nicely with developing and executing your key business strategies?
That’s why this book was originally going to be called GRC For Dummies. But
(as you can see by the title), it’s SAP GRC For Dummies. That’s a bit of a mis-
nomer because unlike classics like SAP NetWeaver for Dummies, this book is
not all about SAP software. It’s mainly about GRC. But SAP has leading soft-
ware for GRC, so at the end of relevant chapters, we tell you about products
like SAP GRC Risk Management and how it can help you. This book could
have been all about SAP GRC, easily — there are probably areas that SAP
covers that you don’t even know about. (For example, we bet you didn’t
know that SAP is a leader in the area of software for environmental manage-
ment.) But just a disclaimer before we start—there’s a lot more to learn about
SAP GRC than we cover in this book. We focus on giving you the background
to get started conceptually in the most important areas. 
Now that we’ve explained a bit about the book, are you ready to get started
and to become well-versed in GRC? That way, if you need a conversation
stopper for Aunt Ida at Thanksgiving — or, better, a conversation starter
when talking to almost anyone about what it takes to succeed in business
today — you’ll be prepared.
Foolish Assumptions
In writing this book, we made a few assumptions. If you fit one of these
assumptions, this book is for you:
 You’re interested in GRC from a corporate perspective. You can think
about GRC from an individual perspective (paying your taxes, protecting
your identity, and balancing your checkbook, for example), but this
book talks about how to use GRC to improve your company, not your
household.
 You have some background in common business terms like profit and
loss and common accounting terms such as general ledger and purchase
order.
 You’re not adverse to acronyms. GRC can be a little like alphabet soup at
times. For clarity, we provide a glossary to help you find your way through
the more obscure TLAs (three-letter acronyms).
How This Book Is Organized
To help you get a better picture of what this book has to offer, we explain a
little about how we organized it and what you can expect to find in each part.

SAP GRC For Dummies 

Part I: Governance, Risk, and 
Compliance Demystified
You need to have a good foundation in place to see how GRC can help you.
Part I starts out with the ABCs of GRC to give you the big picture and then
heads straight into risk and governance to round out your education.
Part II: Diving into GRC
The C in GRC is for compliance, and Part II takes you through some of the reg-
ulations companies must comply with and the corporate scandals that led to
those regulations. Once you know about them, what do you do about them?
This part also addresses tools like access control and process control that
can help you ensure compliance. And, since globalization has brought so
many companies into the global trade arena, Part II provides details about
the compliance-related issues you need to know about to effectively source
goods from or sell goods to other countries.
Part III: Going Green
Saving the planet is on everyone’s minds these days, and it’s not just good
policy—it’s good business, too. Part III addresses how you can ensure that
your company’s policies about people, processes, and products keep you
compliant with the law and enable you to deepen your company’s shade of
green. 
Part IV: Managing the Flow of Information
GRC is strategic. It can provide you with new insights into how to run your
business. Part IV first delves into the flow of information in the enterprise
from an IT GRC perspective, ensuring that data is kept secure and private, for
example. It then turns to the important area of sustainability reporting, the
nonfinancial reporting that more and more companies are doing and which is
so important to a variety of stakeholders, from employees to investors to
nongovernment organizations such as Greenpeace. Finally, and perhaps most
importantly, Part IV addresses how you can use what you learn about your
company through a program of integrated GRC to help you envision and exe-
cute the best possible corporate strategy.

Part V: The Part of Tens
Maybe the Part of Tens are your favorite part in any For Dummies book (we
always look for them). Here you’ll find best practices for GRC implementation
and best practices for global trade. You’ll also find pointers to resources to
help you in your quest to become an expert in the area of GRC, from books to
blogs to web sites.
Glossary
As you read this book (or skip from chapter to chapter, section to section,
looking over only those parts that interest you), you may have additional
questions in some areas. That’s why we include a comprehensive glossary,
chock full of definitions of the many terms that you’re likely to encounter as
you learn more about GRC. 
Icons Used in This Book
To help you get the most out of this book, we use icons that tell you at a
glance if a section or paragraph has important information of a particular
kind.
This icon indicates information that is more technical in nature, and not
strictly necessary for you to read. If technical jargon gives you a headache,
feel free to skip these.
When you see this icon, you know we’re offering advice or shortcuts to
quickly improve your understanding of GRC concepts.
Look out! This is something tricky or unusual to watch for.

Where to Go from Here
If you’re new to SAP GRC or GRC in general, your next step is to head straight
to Chapter 1, which gives you the ABCs of GRC, as well as providing food for
thought about what GRC can do for you.
If you’re a professional in a particular area — such as global trade, risk man-
agement, or IT governance — you could decide to visit particular chapters in
no particular order. But (and we’re probably biased) we think the best way
forward from here is straight into Chapter 1 (with a few intervening pages to
entertain you on your way there).

In this part . . .
You start your GRC education with the ABCs of GRC.
Even if you’re a GRC expert, Chapter 1 gives you the
panoramic view of how GRC can help you run your busi-
ness better. You then move into the all-important area of
risk — nothing ventured, nothing gained. You ﬁnd out that
properly managing risk is one of the most important fac-
tors for business success today. And to put those
management strategies into practice systematically,
Chapter 3 lays a solid governance foundation, uncovering
what governance means and all its implications.

G
overnance, Risk, and Compliance, almost always referred to as GRC, is
the latest addition to the parade of three-letter acronyms that are used
to describe the processes and software that run the business world. The goal
of GRC is to help a company efficiently put policies and controls in place to
address all its compliance obligations while at the same time gathering infor-
mation that helps proactively run the business. Done properly, GRC creates a
central nervous system that helps you manage your business more effectively.
You also derive a competitive advantage from understanding risks and choos-
ing opportunities wisely. In other words, GRC helps you make sure that you
do things the right way: It keeps track of what you are doing and raises an
alert when things start to go off track or when risks appear.
This opening chapter takes you on a top-to-bottom tour of GRC to help you
understand in greater detail what GRC means and what companies are doing
to lower the costs and create new value.
Getting to Know GRC
GRC is not just about complying with requirements for one quarter or one
year. Rather, those who are serious about GRC, meaning just about everyone
these days, seek to create a system and culture so that compliance with
external regulations, enforcement of internal policies, and risk management
are automated as much as possible and can evolve in an orderly fashion as
business and compliance needs change. That’s why some would say that the
C in GRC should stand for controls: controls that help make the process of
compliance orderly and make process monitoring — and improvement —
easier.

Some parts of the domain of GRC — measures to prevent financial fraud, for
example — are as old as business itself. Making sure that money isn’t leaking
out of a company and ensuring that financial reports are accurate have always
been key goals in most businesses—only recently have they attained new
urgency.
Other parts of GRC related to trade compliance, risk management, and envi-
ronmental, health, and safety regulations are somewhat newer activities that
have become more important because of globalization, security concerns,
and increased need to find and mitigate risks. For example, to ship goods
overseas, you must know that the recipient is not on a list of prohibited com-
panies. These lists change daily. Growing concern about global warming and
other pressures to reduce environmental impact and use energy efficiently
have increased regulations that demand reporting, tracking, and other forms
of sociopolitical compliance. Companies are also interested in sustainability
reporting, measuring areas such as diversity in the workplace, the number of
employees who volunteer, and environmental efforts, so that companies can
provide data about corporate social responsibility. Financial markets punish
companies that report unexpected bad news due to poor risk management.
One simple goal of GRC is to keep the CFO out of jail, but that description is
too narrow to capture all of the activity that falls under the umbrella of GRC.
(It’s also an exaggeration; the truth is that simple noncompliance is more
likely to result in big fines rather than a long trip to the big house. But, that
said, most executives prefer to leave no stone unturned rather than risk
breaking rocks in the hot sun.) Most companies now face demands from 
regulators, shareholders, and other stakeholders. Financial regulations like
Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) in the United States and similar laws around the world
mean that senior executives could face criminal penalties if financial reports
have material errors. (For more on Sarbanes-Oxley, flip ahead to Chapter 4.)
All of this means a lot more testing and checking, which is costly without
some form of automation. 
If GRC seems like a sideshow to your main business, remember you can’t get
out of it, so you might as well make it work for you, not against you. At first,
especially in 2004 — the first year in which Sarbanes-Oxley compliance became
mandatory — companies frequently engaged in a mad rush, throwing people,
auditors, spreadsheets, and whatever resources were required at the problem.
Although the rush to comply was heroic, it was far from efficient. Now compa-
nies are understanding how to turn GRC activities into an advantage.
The question every company must answer is the following: Will we do the
bare minimum to make sure that we stay out of trouble, or can GRC become
an opportunity for us to find new ways of running our business better? 
10
Part I: Governance, Risk, and Compliance Demystified 

Because it is concerned with creating a sustained stream of high-quality infor-
mation about a business, GRC has a large overlap with Corporate Performance
Management (CPM), a topic we cover in greater detail in Chapter 15.
If the burdens of GRC are a cloud, the silver lining is that in learning how to
keep track of business in greater depth, GRC activities are transformed from
an annoyance to a gateway to an expanded consciousness in a company, which
can lead to better performance, reduced costs, and competitive advantage.
GRC is part of the natural process of turning strategy into action, monitoring
performance, and tracking and managing the risks involved. Choosing to see
GRC as an opportunity can mean significant savings in auditing costs, creating
new sources of information for improving processes, finding risks earlier, and
most of all, avoiding those nasty surprises that spark a punishing reaction in
the stock market.
Getting in the Business Drivers’ Seat
In some ways, GRC is nothing new: Almost every activity under the bailiwick
of GRC has been going on for quite some time in the business world. The seg-
regation of duties that is required by Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley has always
been part of an auditor’s toolkit of recommendations when it comes to prevent-
ing fraud. Companies have always been under the obligation to report financial
results accurately, to comply and report on their performance with respect to
environmental, safety, and trade laws, and to identify risks as early as possible.
Every well-run company — whether private or public — puts its own unique
self-inflicted policies in place and makes sure that they are being followed. As
times change, all of these measures must be updated.
What caused the birth of GRC as an area of focus for companies and those
who provide consulting services and software was a perfect storm of urgency
about various issues. Consider the following elements of that perfect storm:
 In the wake of the go-go culture of the Internet investing boom of the late
1990s, massive, systematic fraud was revealed at major companies such
as Enron, WorldCom, Adelphi, and others. In many cases, the controls
and external forms of scrutiny that were in place to stop such bad
behavior had failed for many different reasons, including fraud, conflicts
of interest, and other forms of malfeasance.
 At the same time, the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 led to a
worldwide tightening of controls on trade, especially with respect to
sales of certain types of products or materials that were deemed danger-
ous if fallen into the wrong hands. For example, ITT shipped night vision
goggle components to China and other countries, resulting in a U.S.
Department of Justice fine of $100 million.
11
Chapter 1: The ABCs of GRC

 The third force driving the urgency of GRC is the rising concern about
energy consumption and the environment. Instability in the Mideast,
scarcity of oil supply due to increased consumption, and lack of new oil
discoveries have driven oil prices to record highs. Worries about global
warming have caused a new wave of demands for energy efficiency,
reductions in environmental impact, and a desire for companies to
demonstrate the long-term sustainability of their operations.
Lawmakers around the world awoke to this crisis and felt a burning need to
DO SOMETHING! A debate still rages about the wisdom of the governmental
response, but there is no mistaking the result: an across-the-board increase 
of the volume and urgency of compliance activities. But seeing GRC only in
terms of Sarbanes-Oxley and financial compliance is a mistake. Although
complying with Sarbanes-Oxley and other similar laws that have been
enacted worldwide certainly spurred many companies to action, after they
got started, companies realized that there was a whole other field of compli-
ance, risk, and governance-related activities that needed to be performed
with greater attention and efficiency.
Investors, along with governments and regulators, insurance companies, rat-
ings agencies, and activist stakeholders have also joined in increasing the
urgency with respect to transparency and accuracy of information about the
company’s operations and actions taken to mitigate risks and issues. Stock
markets have dealt brutal punishment to companies that report problems
with internal controls or other negative surprises. Consider these statistics:
 According to a McKinsey Study, investors in North America and Western
Europe will pay a premium of 14 percent for companies with good gover-
nance, as shown in Figure 1-1.
 The difference in stock market value for companies that had good inter-
nal controls versus those that did not is 33 percent.
 AMR Research predicted that companies would spend $29.9 billion on
compliance initiatives in 2007 alone, up 8.5 percent from the previous
year, indicating that GRC spending continues to grow as companies 
cope with the myriad challenges in this area.
All of these forces combined led to the creation of the domain of GRC as
companies realized that an ad hoc approach to meeting these demands was
too expensive and actually increased risk for the companies because they
couldn’t mitigate issues they didn’t know about. 
The difficulty facing most companies right now is not how to meet these GRC
challenges — the fact is, the forces that are driving increased attention to
GRC are not optional for the most part and companies have no choice but 
to comply — but rather how to comply efficiently in a way that produces 
benefits. GRC shouldn’t be just a cost that does nothing else for your busi-
ness, but that may become your attitude if you want to be just good enough
to barely meet minimum compliance standards.
12
Part I: Governance, Risk, and Compliance Demystified 

One way of thinking of GRC is to compare the process of managing a company
to driving a car. When you drive a car, you have a certain set of rules that you
are expected to abide by. You have to have a driver’s license and insurance.
Your car must be inspected for compliance with safety and environmental
laws. When you are driving, you are encouraged by law enforcement and
penalties to drive within speed limits and other restrictions. You may have
your own rules about driving, such as never driving while talking on your cell
phone in order to be as safe as possible. Other activities such as maintaining
the car are up to you and various drivers will have different approaches.
Some will change the oil more often than recommended or rotate tires fre-
quently, some will use premium gas, and so on.
What has happened with GRC, to use the driving analogy again, is that the laws
for everything related to driving got tighter and more restrictive and the
penalties got higher. In addition, the rewards for driving efficiently and safely
became much higher. So, you can now figure out how to drive just to keep out
of trouble with external watchdogs, or you can figure out how to drive in a
new more efficient way that better helps your business win in the marketplace,
while still playing by all the rules.
GRC is a new management mentality. The bad news is that more work is
required to comply with regulations. More testing and controls have to be 
in place and the organization has to be carefully designed. As exceptions to
Investors worldwide will pay a premium of 14%
or more for shares in companies with good
governance.
But companies with internal controls deficiencies

policies occur, behavior must be checked and monitored. As people are pro-
moted or job descriptions change, controls must be put in place so that com-
pliance can be maintained. New forms of data must be captured and consulted.
Risks must be proactively discovered while they are still small enough to
manage. Without a doubt, this brave new world requires more work, and
there is a shortage of trained people and expertise to carry it out.
The upside of GRC is that in addressing these issues systematically, the culture
and performance of a company improves. In many ways, GRC is concerned
with meta processes, which are those that look at the shape and flow of infor-
mation in other processes in order to identify weak points. Controls and 
compliance are only one result of GRC: They put the C in GRC, if you will.
When properly addressed, GRC helps identify ways that core business
processes can be improved. Identification of risks also leads to discovery of
opportunities. Governance processes can help create orderly ways to evolve
a company, and improve program and change management across the board. 
Getting Motivated to Make 
the Most of GRC
Although concern about GRC is growing, most companies that have engaged
in a program of GRC are usually reacting to some pressure or concern that
takes GRC from a necessary evil to an initiative that can really benefit the
company if is executed thoroughly and efficiently. A serious approach to GRC
may flow from any or all of these motivating forces that we discuss in the fol-
lowing sections.
Complying with financial regulations
New laws in the United States and in many other countries mean that if seri-
ous errors in financial reports are found, those responsible will face criminal
prosecution. Section 302 of Sarbanes-Oxley says exactly this, and prosecutors
around the nation have shown great eagerness to enforce this law.
It is not just American companies that are facing such dramatic penalties. See
the “A global reaction to improve governance” sidebar later in this chapter
for more on changes to GRC laws in other countries around the world.
Governments of most of the largest economies have passed their own forms
of legislation increasing the level of scrutiny about financial reporting and
controls.
The driving force behind this regulation is the fear that inaccurate financial
reporting will damage the financial system. Without accurate financial infor-
mation, investors will have little to go on when making decisions about where
14
Part I: Governance, Risk, and Compliance Demystified 

to place their money. If confidence drops too far, all companies, not just those
who have engaged in bad behavior, will find it harder and more expensive to
raise money. This is not the first time that such fears have been raised and
reporting requirements have been tightened. Even the powerful tycoons of
the Robber Baron era had bankers insisting on better accounting.
So, while compliance with regulations aimed at improving financial reporting
and governance is really just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to GRC,
fears related to such compliance are clearly the force that has driven most
companies to action.
Failing an audit
There is nothing like failing an audit to spur companies to improve their GRC
processes. In the wake of a failed audit, which must be reported in public
financial statements, investors frequently lose confidence and sell stock. 
Nowadays, audits can fail for more reasons than ever. Discovery of fraud or
other bad behavior is of course the most dramatic reason. But in the face of

The march of the three-letter acronyms
The world of enterprise software has given birth
to many Three-Letter Acronyms, called appro-
priately by yet another three-letter acronym: TLA.
Here is a sample of the most common TLAs:
 Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) soft-
ware emerged in the 1990s to provide a
complete financial model of a business
along with tracking many other aspects.
ERP was about closing the books faster
and tracking the key financial and man-
agement processes of a business.
 Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
software emerged in the late 1990s to give a
name to software that tracked sales, service,
billing, and other activities related to cus-
tomer interactions with a business. CRM
was about getting closer to the customer.
 Supply Chain Management (SCM) software
emerged in the 1990s to track the flow 
of goods and manufacturing processes
among a distributed network of partners
working together. SCM helped manage
increased specialization, outsourcing, and
globalization.
 Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) soft-
ware emerged in the 1990s to give a name to
the processes related to creating new prod-
ucts, bringing them to market, and improving
them. PLM was about helping increase the
speed of product development.
 Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)
software emerged in the 2000s to automate
controls to facilitate compliance with finan-
cial, environmental, health, and safety, and
trade regulations, enforce internal controls,
increase the efficiency of audits, identify
risks, and employ proper governance proce-
dures to keep all of these activities up to date
and effective.

tighter regulations for governance and reporting, audit problems can include
the lack of adequate controls, improper segregation of duties, insufficient
oversight of the creation of financial reports, and many other causes. So 
even if nothing is wrong, you can fail your audit for not having sufficient 
documentation.
In the wake of a failed audit, reporting requirements skyrocket. Controls, which
are detailed reports of various types of activity that must be cross-checked for
problems, may have to be run on a monthly or quarterly basis instead of annu-
ally. New controls are usually introduced. Other sorts of testing to discover
problems will also usually result. The work related to all of this new activity
must be staffed either from inside a company or by personnel from an auditing
or consulting firm. Either way, costs rise.

Part I: Governance, Risk, and Compliance Demystified 
A global reaction to improve governance
Everyone talks about Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX), but
it’s certainly not the only law shaping gover-
nance today. Numerous countries have enacted
legislation to improve governance. As with the
United States, many of these countries have
passed legislation in response to the outcry
over corporate scandals. Although they differ by
name, the laws passed by various countries
have similarities, namely with regard to estab-
lishing internal controls and effecting improved
financial reporting:
 Japan: J-SOX: On June 7, 2006, Japanese
legislators passed the Financial Instruments
and Exchange Law, part of which includes
the so-called J-SOX requirements. The two
main components of the J-SOX legislation
are the “Evaluation of and Reporting on
Internal Control for Financial Reports,”
which forces management to assume
responsibility for developing and operating
internal controls, and the “Audit of Internal
Control for Financial Reports,” in which a
company’s external auditor, aside from its
regular auditing duties, must conduct an
audit of management’s evaluation of the
effectiveness of internal control for financial
reports. The J-SOX requirements took effect
starting in April 2008.
 Canada: Bill 198: Bill 198, also known as C-
SOX, became effective on October 1, 2003.
Its formal name is “Keeping the Promise for
a strong Economy Act (Budget Measures),
2002.” This bill requires companies to
“[create and] maintain a system of internal
controls related to the effectiveness and
efficiency of their operations, including
financial reporting and asset control.” It
also requires companies to place internal
controls over their disclosure procedures.
 Australia: CLERP 9 in Australia: In 2001,
Australia passed the Corporations Act,
which governs corporate law. In 2004, a
reform to the Corporations Act was passed,
called the Corporate Law Economic Reform
Program (Audit Reform & Corporate Dis-
closure) Act 2004 (or CLERP 9). CLERP 9
aims to make sure that business regulation
is consistent with promoting a strong econ-
omy, in addition to providing a framework
that helps businesses adapt to change.
Three entities were created by CLERP 9:
The Financial Reporting Council, the
Australian Stock Exchange’s Corporate
Governance Council, and the Shareholder
and Investors Advisory Council. 

The rising costs that occur after a failed audit are a powerful motivator for a
company to automate its GRC processes so that controls and testing are
much easier and cheaper.
Experiencing a rude awakening
Another sort of inspiration for improved GRC performance comes in the form
of outside scrutiny. When auditors come in and start asking questions, some-
times companies discover that they don’t really have their GRC issues under
control after all. Usually this happens because people do not deeply under-
stand the demands that laws and regulations are placing on them or the 
complexity of meeting those demands using their current software systems.
Scrutiny can also come from senior management, the board of directors, new
employees, auditors, and so on. The problem with GRC and the reason that it
has become a new TLA is that it can be hard and complicated to get right.
Companies that lack the knowledge and expertise may think they are safe
when they actually are not.
Going from private to public
The imminent conversion of a company from a private form of ownership to a
public form can be another driver of increased attention to GRC. An Initial
Public Offering (IPO), in which a company sells stock to the public for the
17
Chapter 1: The ABCs of GRC
 England: Combined Code of Corporate
Governance: In England, as in many other
countries, legislation has been enacted as
a response to corporate scandal. Two of the
most famous scandals were Polly Peck and
Maxwell of the late ‘80s and early ‘90s.
These scandals led to the creation of quite
a few reports that dealt with many gover-
nance issues. One of these reports, the
Hampel Report, led to the Combined Code
of Corporate Governance (1998). Some of
the areas the Combined Code covers are
the structure and operations of a company’s
board, its directors’ pay, accountability and
audit, and the responsibilities of institutional
shareholders.
 India: Clause 49: Clause 49 went into effect
in December 2005. Its main goal is to
improve corporate governance for all com-
panies listed on India’s Stock Exchange.
Clause 49 focuses on issues that are
already implemented in many other coun-
tries, such as establishing a board of direc-
tors and appointing a managing director
who reports to the board, in addition to the
creation of an audit committee. A revised
Clause 49 was released on October 9, 2004.
This revision covers many areas, including
a clarification and enhancement of the
responsibilities of the board and the direc-
tor and a consolidation of the roles of the
audit committee as they relate to controls
and financial reporting.

first time, is a common way for a private company to become a public one.
But other events such as selling bonds or issuing other forms of debt can
also initiate the same requirements to meet higher levels of reporting.
Private companies also seek to improve their GRC processes if they may be
up for sale to public companies that have to meet more stringent levels of
governance and reporting. Whether you’re looking at a merger or acquisition
or taking a company public, having all the ducks in a row, so to speak, can
make the acquisitions process much smoother and can also make the differ-
ence between controlling the timing of an IPO or playing catch-up to try to
get things in order.
On the other hand, even private companies can benefit from implementing
the best practices highlighted by SOX. Private companies with government
contracts get a favorable reaction from the government when they implement
best practices based on SOX. There’s certainly no harm in improving internal
controls and corporate governance, and the benefits can be very real both in
terms of clean financials and process efficiencies.
Managing growth
Smaller companies that are on a dramatic growth curve frequently use a GRC
implementation as a way to make sure that as new employees are quickly
hired, threats to the organization’s financial health do not occur. With appro-
priate controls and tests, management can rest assured that the company is
not at risk as more new people take over key tasks.
18
Part I: Governance, Risk, and Compliance Demystified 
Jail, schmail
The drumbeat of GRC consultants stating that
“we’ll keep you out of jail” has too long defined
the conversation about GRC. It’s time for a real-
ity check.
Jail is a remedy for people who are engaged in
criminal activity. But if you’re entering a GRC
program to stay out of jail, you’re missing the
point. The point of GRC is to run your business
better, expand your consciousness of what is
going on, and provide employees with guidance
about what they should be doing and to find out
when they’re not doing it.
You can apply that knowledge to all sorts of
areas: governance, risk, compliance, trade,
environmental, data privacy, and much more. If
you do it right, GRC can help you run your busi-
ness better than ever before, gain competitive
advantage, and increase the rewards to you
and your shareholders.
From a shareholder perspective, which is worse:
a CEO going to jail or an entire company running
itself on stale data?

Smaller companies generally have more issues with segregation of duties for
obvious reasons. Segregation of duties requires dividing key steps among
employees to help prevent fraud that could take place if one person did all
the tasks. But with fewer employees, there is less specialization and a single
person may be doing many more tasks than in a larger company.
One common misunderstanding is that implementing GRC means that all
potential conflicts are eliminated. Even in the largest companies, this is
almost never the case. Usually, some employees are able to do things that
might result in fraud. Such potential conflicts can be handled by adding con-
trols and tests that reveal any bad behavior.
Taking out an insurance policy
When new owners arrive to take over a company, implementing GRC is one
common way to make sure that everything is operating properly and that
nothing fraudulent is taking place. GRC is like added insurance for the new
owners: Adding the controls and testing that is part of a thorough GRC imple-
mentation provides added assurance that the financial management of a com-
pany is taking place in a proper way and that the condition of the company is
accurately conveyed by its accounting reports.
Managing risk
Companies that have had a series of nasty surprises often improve GRC pro-
cesses and automation as a way to create an early warning system to identify
and manage potential operational risks. Unforeseen risks can lead to punish-
ment in the markets as investors worry about what problems might be next.
As this chapter has noted, it is a mistake to think of GRC only in financial
terms. Risks that have dire financial consequences can arise from a multitude
of operational factors that never show up on a balance sheet. For example, in
a manufacturing plant, what if spare parts inventory for a key piece of equip-
ment drops to dangerously low levels? If someone notices this, how can they
go on record to make sure that the significance of the risk is understood and
that management knows that something must be done to avoid a huge prob-
lem? The risk management processes of GRC provide just such a solution.
Reducing costs
The desire to cut costs related to GRC is another major driver of GRC auto-
mation. In the mad rush to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley in 2004, many 
compliance activities were performed manually. Information was gathered,
19
Chapter 1: The ABCs of GRC

organized in spreadsheets or other simple ways, and then used to make sure
that the company was complying with all requirements. 
While this sort of manual work was inevitable the first time around, and per-
haps even beneficial in that it gave those involved a hands-on understanding
of what sort of work needed to be done and information needed to be assem-
bled, it was not efficient.
Given the shortage of personnel trained in GRC and the expense of using
external consultants and auditors to perform reporting and analysis related
to controls and testing, many companies are seeking to implement GRC as a
way to increase automation and cut costs. Some companies have reported
reductions in auditing costs of more than 20 percent.
Struggling with the high 
volume of compliance
Risk goes way beyond financials and so does compliance. Globalization means
that goods may be sourced from just about anywhere and shipped anywhere,
and the compliance requirements for moving these goods are significant:
each cross-border trade can involve as many as 25 different parties and gen-
erate 35 documents that must be tracked and saved. Furthermore, security
issues have made the “anywhere” part of this more difficult as well; there are
about 50 denied persons lists — lists of undesirable persons and companies
that governments forbid shipping goods to — that must be checked before
goods are shipped.
Environmental regulations are also increasingly the focus of compliance. The
number of environmental regulations companies must comply with is con-
stantly growing, both at the state and national level, particularly relating 
to hazardous substances. In many cases, the sheer volume of compliance
activities forces automation because no other approach is feasible.
Introducing the GRC Stakeholders
No matter what the motivators and how much automation you may apply,
the essence of GRC is to change the hearts and minds of the people in a com-
pany. The responsibility for GRC enforcement and implementation is spread
across a variety of different stakeholders, each of which plays an important
role. Understanding the interactions between these stakeholders is a key 
element of a successful program of GRC improvement.
20
Part I: Governance, Risk, and Compliance Demystified 

GRC stakeholders inside a company
Like every other major trend affecting business, increased attention to GRC
concerns is having its effect on the organizational chart. Of course, the ulti-
mate responsibility for all corporate issues resides with the board of direc-
tors and the CEO, and then devolves down through the organization. At most
companies, the operational responsibility for implementing a program for
improving GRC performance resides with the COO or CFO. The consequences
of inadequate attention to GRC processes are so extreme that interest from
senior management is at an all-time high.
The need for effective management of GRC has led to the creation of a new
set of titles that may include any of the following:
 Chief Compliance Officer, Vice President of Compliance
 Chief Risk Officer, Vice President of Risk
 Chief Sustainability Officer, Vice President of Sustainability
 Manager of
• SOX
• Compliance
• Risk
• Sustainability
• Trade Management
• Environment, Health, and Safety
Some analysts recommend that companies keep any organization dedicated
to GRC as small as possible. From this point of view, GRC should be some-
thing for which every line of business is responsible. The creation of a sepa-
rate department dedicated to GRC is an invitation to empire building. After a
department dedicated to any specific purpose is created, it tends to grow.
The ideal way to implement GRC is to make compliance efficient and easy
through controls, training, and automation so that improved business
processes make the process easy, a part of everyone’s day-to-day work,
instead of creating a large cost center.
GRC stakeholders outside a company
Investors and shareholders have perhaps the most to lose monetarily from
failures of GRC processes. When a stock price drops after a company reports
an audit failure, a material breach of compliance with regulations, or any
other sort of negative event that could have been foreseen, investors are
demonstrating their profound concern.
21
Chapter 1: The ABCs of GRC

Besides investors, the other important external groups are institutions inside
and outside of government that set rules that must be followed. This group
includes all of the following types of organizations:
 Legislative bodies that make laws that must be complied with.
 Government agencies responsible for carrying out laws, such as OSHA,
the EPA, U.S. Customs, and many others. 
 Financial regulators that set standards for financial reporting, such as
the Securities Exchange Commission, Financial Accounting Standards
Board, Federal Reserve, Bank for International Settlements, and others. 
 Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs) charged with setting policies
that govern how business is done, such as the United Nations.
 Trade organizations such as the World Trade Organization, World
Intellectual Property Organization, NAFTA, CAFTA, and others.
 Auditing firms that certify the correctness of procedures and policies
used for financial reports.
This list of stakeholders is constantly changing as new issues arise and new
laws and regulations are created to address them.
Understanding GRC by the Letters
So far in this chapter, we’ve treated GRC like a large black box: a mysterious
container full of improved processes and software for automation. Now it is
time to open that box and look inside at all the moving parts. The challenge
in moving to a more detailed discussion of GRC is that the meaning of the
terms and the actions required are different depending on the nature of 
the business. GRC activities at a stock brokerage firm will be quite different
from those at a chain of grocery stores, for example, although the goals at 
the highest level are the same.
This section breaks down GRC into its component parts by looking at the
meaning of each of the three words that make up the acronym: governance,
risk, and compliance. The challenge here is that these words are general
terms as well as terms of art applied to GRC, so we start our discussion by
separating the informal meanings of the terms from the precise way these
words are used with respect to GRC.
22
Part I: Governance, Risk, and Compliance Demystified 

Governance
Governance is a general term. The way that a board of directors works with a
CEO is a form of governance, for example. The governance in GRC is that
which is exercised by the CEO on down. How are you going to do what you
must do to execute on a strategy? How is the CEO making sure that the right
policies and procedures are in place to run a company? How are those poli-
cies communicated? What sort of checking is done to make sure that the 
policies and procedures are being followed? How are the policies and proce-
dures updated? What controls are in place? How can methods of checking
and confirming that policies are being followed be improved?
Risk
The word risk is the trickiest of the three that make up the GRC acronym. All
of GRC, for example, can be seen as an exercise in understanding and control-
ling the risk of running a business. So a program of GRC improvement helps
reduce the risk of failing to comply with regulations for financial reporting,
trade, environmental protection, or safety. GRC also deals with the risk of not
having adequate governance structures to keep a company under control and
effectively managed. Every business strategy runs certain risks that can be
identified at the outset and must be monitored. There is also the risk of not
identifying operational risks that may have significant impact on a business
early and dealing with them adequately. The R in GRC includes all these risks,
in fact, any risk the business faces.
Compliance
Compliance is the term that has a general meaning that is closest to the way
it applies specifically to GRC. Compliance in general means that you are satis-
fying a set of conditions that has been set forth for you. Compliance implies
that someone else has set those conditions up and that you must meet them.
That’s exactly what’s going on in GRC. Most of the time, when people talk
about compliance, they are referring to external standards for which compli-
ance is mandatory. The word compliance also sometimes refers to internal
standards as well.
Defining the C in GRC as standing for controls can broaden the discussion.
Compliance is what we have to do, and controls are the way we do it.
Furthermore, controls are a way to monitor that the business is compliant,
and also efficient and orderly in every way.
23
Chapter 1: The ABCs of GRC

Figure 1-2 shows the way that the three core activities of governance, risk
management, and compliance interact.
Figure 1-2 shows GRC from the top down. Governance guidelines, which are
the policies and rules of the game for a company that explain how the com-
pany will be run to best meet its obligations and pursue the business strategy,
are set forth by senior management. The operational executives then carry out
programs and put in place controls that ensure compliance, frequently with the
help of consultants or auditors who are expert in applying GRC. Risk manage-
ment results in the creation of mechanisms so that risks can be brought to the
attention of senior managers who then take steps to reduce them.
So although Figure 1-2 shows a top-down structure, in most companies, GRC
is actually implemented from the bottom up, like this:
1. The company puts in place controls to make sure that compliance
requirements are satisfied so that no laws or regulations are violated.
2. After the controls are in place, which may take a year or more to achieve,
the next task is to analyze what has been done to make it more efficient
and effective and to reduce costs associated with compliance. 
At this stage processes for governance may begin to be developed as
internal policies are added to external requirements and the company
looks at its compliance activities from the top down.
Risk management processes may be added at any time during this cycle,
depending on how worried a company is about risks connected to a particu-
lar strategy or about unforeseen risks. With this cycle in mind, in the next few
sections, we explain the activities involved in each area of GRC in greater

detail. In preschool, you may have learned letters by remembering that A is
for apple: The same approach can be taken with GRC. We take the bottom up
approach in our explanation and work through the acronym from right to left.
C Is for Compliance: Playing 
by the Rules
The goal of the compliance process is to make sure that a company meets or
exceeds all of the demands that are placed on it by external institutions that
make laws and regulations for various purposes. Compliance is also concerned
with self-inflicted rules; in other words, policies related to how a company
does business. Financial compliance is the one that has gotten the most
attention in the past couple of years, but trade management and environmen-
tal, health, and safety compliance are also always key concerns. These areas
are all interrelated and provide companies a set of guidelines to follow from a
perspective of best practices and processes. Each of these areas will be cov-
ered in detail later in this section.
Some regulations require that reports of activities are created and may set
thresholds for acceptable financial ratios or amounts of emissions, for exam-
ple. Others require that a company’s processes have a certain shape or follow
certain guidelines so that certain types of bad behavior become impossible or
extremely difficult. But by far the most frequently mandated item from a com-
pliance perspective is the mandate that a company have sufficient controls to
detect bad behavior. A complete grasp of what controls are and how they
work is key to a complete understanding of GRC.
Controls: Mechanisms of compliance
Controls are the means by which bad behavior or violations of policies are
discovered. Controls also provide companies with an alert mechanism for
highlighting what processes are working well and which areas need to be
improved. By finding out what’s working and what’s not, companies can 
optimize all their processes through the enterprise.
Some controls are preventative, meaning that they stop you from doing things
that are not allowed. Preventative controls are frequently part of access 
control, which is the discipline of allowing people to have access only to
transactions and capabilities that they need to do their jobs and to limit the
potential for bad behavior. Access control is key to managing segregation of
duties, which is one of the most important mandates of Sarbanes-Oxley. See
Chapter 5 for more information about segregation of duties.
25
Chapter 1: The ABCs of GRC

Although stopping people from bad behavior is a great idea, preventative
controls are too blunt an instrument to enforce complex policies that may
prohibit actions that take many steps to complete. Most of the controls that
are used to enforce policies in a company are detective controls, which ana-
lyze what has gone on in a company and reveal policy violations or bad
behavior after it has happened. Although in some ways it seems like creating
a system that makes bad behavior impossible is preferable, in practice, the
processes in a business are too complex and fluid to be automated in such 
a rigid way. When implementing policies and enforcing them with detective
controls, you never stop people from doing what they need to do to keep the
business running. You do, however, detect the problems after they occur and
then come up with remedies of various sorts to mitigate the problems and
prevent them in the future. Mitigating controls are those controls that are put
in place to fix any problems created by violations of policies. Mitigating con-
trols are descriptions of steps that need to be taken to fix problems.
Detective controls can either be automated or manual. For a manual control,
someone may have to scour through the logs of various types of activity to
find certain types of transactions and record them in a spreadsheet. Then the
collected transactions are analyzed to see if any of the transactions have vio-
lated a policy. Automated controls gather the information and check for the
violation automatically. Automated controls can also generate alerts and
cases that can be assigned to the appropriate manager for remediation. One
of the key methods for making GRC processes more efficient is through the
application of automated controls. Given that most companies have around
500 controls in place, improving the efficiency of controls can mean signifi-
cant savings. (For more on access control, see Chapter 6; turn to Chapter 7
for more on internal controls.)
Controls are determined by the direction provided by corporate governance
and risk management and then are applied to the most important processes
of the enterprise. One common control is to check the credit of each new 
customer before doing business with them. A control could take the form of
looking at each new customer record and then examining activity to see if a
credit check was performed. If new customers have been created without credit
checks being performed, a mitigating control may need to be executed, per-
haps to perform the credit check after the fact. Then the control may analyze
why the credit check was not performed. Perhaps the problem is systematic,
resulting from inadequate training, for example. Maybe the people creating
new customers did not know that a credit check was required. Perhaps the
problem was that the system used to check credit is unreliable so that credit
checks cannot always be performed. Whatever the reason, the control can dis-
cover a problem that must be dealt with to comply with a policy or regulation.
Some controls are run once a year; for example, to check whether policies for
capitalizing equipment are followed. Other controls may be run once a quar-
ter or once a month. One of the things that usually happens when problems
are discovered in an audit is that controls are run more frequently. If the con-
trols are manual, this means that someone must be doing a lot more work,
26
Part I: Governance, Risk, and Compliance Demystified 

which can drive up auditing and personnel costs (and the cost of doing busi-
ness). Replacing manual controls with automated controls is one way to allow
controls to be run more frequently — in some cases, continuously — without
large additional costs. That way, if 1 in 100 transactions violates a control, an
automated control will catch it every time without incurring the cost of
checking the 99 transactions that did not violate the control. A manual con-
trol that tests every transaction would find such a problem, but the more
common approach — sampling transactions — is unlikely to find needles in
haystacks. Automated controls save money, run 100 percent of the time, and
allow you to practice exception management.
In the process of designing, applying, and analyzing controls in a business, you
develop a deeper understanding of the processes of your business. Problems
discovered by controls can lead to the redesign of processes to better meet
both business and compliance goals. To get the most out of GRC, the insights
gathered in compliance activities must be shared with managers in each
department so that compliance can become part of the process of continuous
improvement.
Domains of compliance
The sorts of controls just described are used in numerous domains of compli-
ance: financial management, global trade, and environmental, health, and
safety. In each of these areas, different external regulators have set forth
increasingly complex rules and regulations. Proof of compliance with these
regulations may be required in the forms of controls, reports, and certifica-
tions to the veracity of reported information. The section below summarizes
the sorts of compliance that are required in each area. For much more infor-
mation, see the following parts of this book:
 Financial compliance is covered in Part II.
 Trade management is also covered in Part II.
 Environmental and safety concerns are covered in Part III.
In addition to these traditional domains of compliance, some newer compli-
ance domains also fall under the GRC umbrella:
 Privacy regulations
 Risk management regulations
 Sustainability
 Internal policies
In the following sections, we discuss each of these domains in detail.
27
Chapter 1: The ABCs of GRC

Financial compliance
Financial compliance these days is dominated by the regulations that have
been introduced by Sarbanes-Oxley. Section 302 of the law makes it a crime
to certify financial statements that have material errors. Section 404 requires
strict segregation of duties to prevent various forms of bad behavior includ-
ing fraud, inaccurate reporting, and other forms of malfeasance.
Section 302 requires that CEOs and CFOs literally sign on the dotted line on
annual and quarterly reports and certify that the information is true. Behind
that signature are many other levels of signatures of everyone in the chain 
of command, stating that they vouch for the numbers they provided for this
report. Controls designed to monitor key processes are one of the ways that
executives and managers feel comfortable putting their signatures on these
reports: Controls help to verify that the numbers are accurate and not inflated.
If a CEO knows that processes like order-to-cash, revenue recognition, and
procure-to-pay are all being monitored closely through a comprehensive set
of controls, the CEO (and those under him or her) can feel comfortable certi-
fying that there is no fraud or inaccuracies in financial reports. If errors do
show up, everyone involved will be more understanding if a full set of compli-
ance and information quality procedures are in place and diligently enforced.
Section 404 is handled through putting access control mechanisms in place.
When someone is given access to a computer system, a role is usually assigned
to them. That role has a set of permissions that grants that user access to a
certain set of transactions. In a modern computer system like SAP ERP, for
example, there can be more than 20,000 transactions and more than 100,000
data elements. Each company has hundreds of roles in place. It is impossible
to manually check that the roles assigned to any one individual do not grant
access that would violate any reasonable segregation of duties schemes.
Depending on the nature of a business, a company may have to provide other
forms of reporting, such as levels of capital for banks or other indicators of
financial health.
Modern GRC systems help automate the process of implementing, running,
and analyzing controls, performing segregation of duties checks, and creating
regulator reports of all kinds. 
Trade management compliance
Compliance with trade management regulations was never simple and has
only become more complex in the post-9/11 era. If you’re doing business with
someone overseas, you must document the answers to the following sorts of
questions:
 Who is it acceptable to do business with?
 Which goods can be sent to which countries?
 What are the limits on amount of goods sent to each country or buyer?
28
Part I: Governance, Risk, and Compliance Demystified 

 What goods qualify under trade agreements?
 How must goods be labeled?
 What information is required to clear customs?
 Is a license required?
 Is a letter of credit required?
Each country has its own regulations. For example, worldwide there are
approximately 50 different lists of denied persons or companies that coun-
tries prohibit sending goods to. Many of these lists change daily. Although
U.S. exporters are mainly concerned with the lists of denied persons from 
a U.S. perspective, best practices state that they should also check the lists
for the countries to which they are shipping the goods. Also, governments
are starting to use more advanced methods of providing information and are
requiring electronic submission of global trade documents. Globalization and
outsourcing mean that more and more goods are moving across borders.
When products are shipped, regulations of the receiving and sending coun-
tries must be satisfied as well as any countries that the goods pass through.
Companies at one time left many of these tasks to the shipping and freight-
forwarding companies. But now compliance is so challenging and the penalties
so severe that this is less often a viable solution. The latest trade management
systems help automate these activities as much as possible through integra-
tion with internal systems like ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) and SCM
(Supply Chain Management) and external sources of information.
Environment, health, and safety compliance
Environmental, health, and safety regulations are constantly moving forward
as new dangers are identified and new concerns arise. OSHA and the Clean
Air Act in the United States, the RoHS act and REACH acts in Europe, and
standards for labeling of hazardous materials, are just a small sample of 
the sort of regulations in effect.
For example, for companies that create and ship hazardous materials, label-
ing requirements differ throughout the world, as do requirements for the data
sheets that accompany such materials.
Risk management compliance
Although laws regarding risk management are not yet mainstream compliance
requirements in the U.S., risk management is increasingly becoming a compli-
ance issue as well. Switzerland and Germany already have laws mandating
risk management. In the U.S., official recommendations indicate that compli-
ance for risk management may not be far away: the U.S. Amended Sentencing
Guidelines state that organizations must take reasonable steps to ensure that
their compliance and ethics programs are followed, including monitoring and
auditing to detect criminal conduct and to evaluate periodically the effective-
ness of their compliance and ethics program. Although risk management is
29
Chapter 1: The ABCs of GRC

not explicitly stated in the guidelines, what is required to meet them is basi-
cally, in fact, a systematic approach to managing and monitoring risks. Also,
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC) recommends a top-down, risk-based
approach to organizations’ SOX compliance requirements.
Data privacy and security compliance
The problem of identity theft is driving increased regulation as well, both in the
areas of data privacy and computer security, which go hand in hand in pro-
tecting sensitive data. Regulations are on the rise in this area, whether it’s
laws regarding how sensitive data must be protected or laws that kick in if a
security breach has occurred (for example, the California Security Breach
Notification Law). In the healthcare industry, HIPAA has strong implications
for how data is handled. The COBIT framework helps companies organize
their compliance in this area; Chapter 14 covers the important topic of IT GRC.
Sustainability reporting
A new horizon in this area is the domain of sustainability, which doesn’t yet
fall in the realm of compliance, but one day might. Companies are increasingly
being asked to demonstrate that their operations do not have long-term dam-
aging effects on the planet and that they practice good corporate citizenship.
The United Nations releases a list of 230 sustainability indicators that compa-
nies may one day be required to report on. Chapter 13 discusses the topic of
sustainability.
R Is for Risk: Creating Opportunity
Risk management is the process of uncovering what could go wrong for the
express purpose of making more things go right. All strategies and all oppor-
tunities worth pursuing involve risks that must be monitored and managed.
Racecars win not just because of their gas pedal but also because of their
brakes, which help drivers deftly maneuver around corners and other obsta-
cles. In the same way, risk management can help companies identify potential
pitfalls and thereby optimize their opportunities for success.
Many types of operational risks don’t appear on the balance sheet but can
have disastrous consequences. Risks in this category include such hazards as
 Environmental catastrophes
 Difficulties with integration of acquisitions
 An aging workforce
 Extreme weather
 Currency fluctuations
30
Part I: Governance, Risk, and Compliance Demystified 

 Kidnapping
 Terrorism
For example, if a key supplier is going to be taken over by a competitor, the
sooner a company knows about it, the better. Or perhaps, a major customer
has indicated they are in big financial trouble and may cut back on orders. Or,
what if replacement parts for a critical piece of equipment are no longer being
produced? A well-run company has a way for its employees to identify such
risks and raise the alarm so that the risks can be prioritized and mitigated.
Unmanaged risks increase the potential for unpleasant surprises. Thinking
that risk management is only about catastrophic risks is a mistake. A series of
unanticipated smaller risks can have an equally devastating effect, especially
if they cause targets for financial performance to be missed, even by a small
amount.
Risk management, though it initially sounds negative, has great potential for
helping companies maximize their opportunities. Reporting mechanisms to
raise alerts about risks may also be used to identify opportunities. When done
properly, risk management can be like a crystal ball that helps you get a vision
of the future, tweak it according to your strategy, and make that improved
vision come true.
G Is for Governance: Keeping 
Focused and Current
Governance is about the big picture, about steering a company in the right
direction and evolving policies, procedures, and processes as needed.
Governance is about how you are doing what the strategy of your business
demands that you do. Governance is about establishing the larger goals, the
top-down perspective that organizes compliance and risk management activi-
ties as well as everything else a company does. Governance is also about
how the data gathered by GRC processes is analyzed and used to improve a
business. 
At the highest level, governance is about steering the corporation: making sure
that a company is selling the right products in the right markets. Governance
exists to translate the strategy set by the board of directors and CEO into the
actions that will bring that strategy to life.
The first step most companies take with respect to GRC is to put in place con-
trols that ensure the firm is complying with external requirements. But after
that has been accomplished, the sort of self-governance shown in Figure 1-3
becomes an issue.
31
Chapter 1: The ABCs of GRC

Self-governance means adding policies, procedures, and controls to enforce
them to those already imposed by external parties. Self-governance helps
create a continuous feedback loop of information to improve the operations
of a company and to make sure that any important operational processes
take place as desired by the board and CEO.
One of the most important governance activities is to look at the existing set
of controls for both imposed and self-imposed governance and ensure that
they have the proper scope and effect. In performing this analysis, a company
frequently gains insights into how to redesign its processes to increase effi-
ciency and better align them to corporate goals. After new ideas for improve-
ments have been discovered, they must be implemented in order to take
effect. In other words, governance, when properly implemented, helps guide
the evolution of a company. For this reason, there is a natural link between
governance and program management.
Hitting the Audit Trail
Increased attention to GRC has been a boon for auditing firms as companies
have hired them to help make sure they are complying with Sarbanes-Oxley
and other regulations. Auditors have been asked to help design and imple-
ment controls and to perform other forms of testing to ensure compliance.

Most auditing activity involves examining the transactional record of a com-
pany that is kept in various sorts of audit trails that record corporate activity.
When this work is performed manually, it can take an enormous amount of
time to carry out. One of the goals of most GRC improvement programs is to
automate as many controls as possible, which means that audits can become
more efficient. This can mean a reduction in certain kinds of auditing fees, but
it also means that auditors can spend more time on higher-value activities.
With more automation, the costs of audits drop but the benefits of audits rise.
Designing Your Approach to GRC
Each company approaches GRC differently depending on its needs and cir-
cumstances. Some firms find that focusing on compliance is all they want to
tackle. Firms in this group may not have trade management or environmen-
tal, health, and safety problems to deal with and may feel that their existing
processes for identifying risks are working adequately. Other companies may
feel they have a good collection of compliance processes in place already and
just want to improve their risk management.
But no matter where a company started from and where it is at now with
respect to its GRC processes, the cost of compliance is large and growing.
Some analysts estimate that companies spend $1 million on compliance for
every $1 billion in revenue. Eventually, the board of directors and CEO will
want to reduce GRC costs, or maybe another of the motivators we mentioned
earlier in this chapter kicks in. That’s when a program of GRC improvement
begins.
After the rush to clean up
The most common pattern that leads to a desire to reduce GRC costs was
caused by the rush to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley in 2004 (see Figure 1-4).

Chapter 1: The ABCs of GRC

 In 2004, companies went through the sprint phase. Risks were identified
and managed with appropriate controls. Roles and user access were
cleaned up.
 In 2005, the marathon phase began. Companies focused on staying clean
and lowering the costs of compliance.
 In 2006 and beyond, companies started to focus on automation to bring
costs down to the lowest level possible.
Another, no doubt oversimplified, way of putting it is that companies rushed
to get clean regardless of cost, and then sought to stay clean as cheaply as
possible.
Stages of GRC adoption
Observers and analysts watching the progression of GRC adoption have iden-
tified four stages of growth and maturity that companies move through as
they improve their GRC processes: reacting, anticipating, collaborating, and
orchestrating. As shown in Figure 1-5, the first step is reacting, which is the
rush to get things done. 
The second step, where most companies are now, involves anticipating needs
and increasing automation. The third step involves higher levels of collabora-
tion in which GRC awareness is propagated throughout an organization. In
the fourth phase of GRC adoption, a company seeks to better orchestrate and
optimize its activities based on greater visibility.

As companies grow in their maturity, they cut costs for compliance and audit-
ing, increase the scope of activities that are monitored by GRC processes,
and make better use of existing systems for GRC purposes.
What GRC Solutions Provide
Companies have found that the ad hoc approach that was used in the sprint
to get clean is expensive and unwieldy. Manual processes that use spread-
sheets to gather and analyze information work to establish compliance, but
drive costs up as the same manual work is repeated again and again. Executing
controls through armies of testers has the same problem. With an ad hoc
approach, there is no common repository for GRC information and little ben-
efit from GRC activities. An integrated approach to GRC allows for risks from
one side of the business to be reviewed by the other side, helping to quickly
build a corporate knowledge base of best practices. The benefits of an inte-
grated approach to GRC can best be accrued by implementing an integrated
GRC solution.
For example, sometimes companies briefly give super-user control of their
systems to people who otherwise don’t have that level of access, perhaps for
year-end processing or because key personnel are on leave. Such access
must be tracked and later carefully revoked. The ad hoc approach to access
control can get you clean, but it doesn’t keep you clean: It’s hard to remem-
ber to revoke that access after the stress of year-end processing has passed.
Smaller companies take the approach of having their audit partners run a
one-time testing to identify access control risks annually. The problem is that
this provides only a snapshot, and without a GRC solution to help monitor
this on a day-to-day basis, problems may go unnoticed for nearly a year
before they are uncovered.
Vendors of GRC software such as SAP have created products that are aimed
at making GRC processes as efficient and inexpensive as possible. Companies
are increasingly adopting GRC solutions because doing so saves money
through automation and provides a consistent context for management of GRC
processes. Using GRC software is especially advantageous in today’s environ-
ment in which there is a shortage of people with GRC skills and experience.
GRC solutions provide a common language and ready-made policies and con-
trols that are built to work with the systems you have in place. A large part of
the value of GRC systems comes from the content that such solutions provide.
For example, a good global trade solution should come with real-time checks
of denied parties lists and a way to generate the proper customs documenta-
tion to ensure that goods cross borders as quickly as possible. 
35
Chapter 1: The ABCs of GRC

Integrated GRC systems not only have a system for managing access control
but they also have rules that take into account the thousands of specific
transactions inside an ERP system so that segregation of duties conflicts can
be avoided. In addition, GRC systems not only have systems for automating
the collection of information and the analysis of that information for controls,
but they come with a large set of commonly needed controls that are ready to
implement.
Perhaps the largest benefit of GRC systems is that they come with a step-by-
step approach of the sort shown in Figure 1-6 that is proven through the
experience gathered at numerous companies.
The general approach of one component of SAP’s solution, SAP GRC Process
Control, is to follow these steps:
1. Document the control environment.
What are you doing? What are your processes? Where are the risks?
2. Test: Implement the process and access controls needed to address
the risks identified.
3. Remediate: Resolve exceptions found by the controls.
4. Analyze: Use the information gathered to gain a deeper understand-
ing of the business. 
5. Optimize: Improve both GRC and business processes as insights are
gathered.

Systematic application of a GRC solution leads to a process that constantly
deepens management’s understanding of what is going on in a business and
increases their confidence that risks are being managed. Figure 1-7 shows
how this leads to a closed-loop system of constant improvement of GRC
processes.
With such a process of continuous improvement in place, companies get the
most important benefit that they are seeking from GRC—the peace of mind
that comes from knowing that financial information is accurate, risks are
being managed, regulations are being complied with, and that the probability
of nasty surprises is as low as it can be.

 Looking at SAP Risk Management
R
isk is a fact of life. No matter what your plans are, whether it’s crossing
the street, going on vacation, or buying a subsidiary — risk is inevitably
involved. However, not all risk is bad. Effective risk management can allow
you to protect the value that you’ve worked to build within your organization
and can also allow you to create new value by identifying opportunities to
build growth, increase competitive advantage, and drive efficiencies through-
out your organization. 
In this chapter, we talk about risk in a new way and discuss how you can use
risk management to both protect value and create new value. This new
approach to risk management enables you to embed a strategic risk method-
ology across your enterprise, at all levels, from operational management, to
line of business owners, risk managers, and senior executives and directors.
This approach to risk management can help enhance performance and inno-
vation for new products, new processes, and new strategies and can allow
risk to become an additional driver of business change.
Discovering Enterprise Risk Management
Enterprise risk management provides a framework for your business to identify
your risks and decide which risks are likely to happen and what the associated
impact will be for your business. By managing this type of information, you can
better protect the value that you have created across your business because
you are more aligned with your risks and can mitigate the potential impact of
those risks.

Enterprise risk management also allows you to become more strategic and
proactive about how your business operates. By using technology to track,
monitor, and even model key risk indicators directly against business perfor-
mance, you can begin to implement change across the enterprise to increase
efficiency and improve business processes. This can lead not only to cost
savings and an improved bottom line, but also to a higher degree of perfor-
mance within your business, and a higher level of competitiveness within
your industry.
In Chapter 1, we talked a bit about compliance and how you can make sure
that you’re following all the laws that apply to businesses. By complying with
laws, you avoid fines and ensure that your business processes and policies
are effectively implemented. Profits increase because fraud is eliminated, or
at least detected and remedied quickly. In a sense, compliance — the C in
GRC — is nonnegotiable: You have to make sure that you do the things that
you have to in order to comply with regulations that govern your business. 
The R in GRC, for Risk, is more strategic and its potential impact on the bottom
line is greater as well. With effective risk management, you can both help 
protect value — your brand name, your quarterly earnings, your sales — and
create value, evaluating the impact of risk on strategy execution as well as
finding new opportunities and evaluating them from a risk-intelligent per-
spective. How you manage risk can literally revolutionize the way you run
your business. The R in GRC is sometimes seen as optional, after all, we have
to comply, and we have to govern well in order to comply. Not everyone real-
izes that managing risk is every bit as important. As we discuss in this chap-
ter, risk management is far from optional. In today’s environment, evaluating
everything from a risk-intelligent perspective can help you win against the
competition and protect your brand at a time when news travels around the
world at the speed of light. And because risk management takes into account
what could go wrong, your risk-adjusted strategy has a much greater chance
of being executed effectively.
Defining Risk
Risk is typically defined as the potential for loss caused by an event that can
adversely affect the achievement of a company’s objectives. That’s true
enough, but it’s only part of the story. Risk awareness can also inform strat-
egy, helping companies select the opportunities to pursue that are most
likely to succeed and that offer the most bang for the buck. That’s why we
say that risk can both help you protect value — protect what you’ve got —
and create value — help you figure out the best way for your business to go
in the future.
40
Part I: Governance, Risk, and Compliance Demystified 

Figure 2-1 lists some types of risks that businesses should think about. Now
that we’ve got you uptight about risk, don’t worry: In this chapter, we also
lead you through some ways to deal with these risks. Thinking about them
may seem like courting failure, but it is in fact one of the best ways to improve
your chances of success.
Although some of the risks illustrated in Figure 2-1 might be considered nega-
tive, keep in mind that some risks can also result from success. You could
have a product launch where demand is much greater than anticipated. Your
founder may be a great entrepreneur and company starter, but not have the
skills to keep the company growing at that initial pace (partly because the
best starters of companies are so good at starting things that they are not
very excited about keeping them going; they start itching to start something
else). Just as both positive and negative events produce stress in our lives
(for example, weddings and new babies are positive events, but undeniably
stressful), so business success can bring stress and associated risks as well.
The risks of success must also be taken into account in order to protect value
in the present and create value in the future.
You have likely heard the sayings, “no risk — no return” or “nothing ventured,
nothing gained.” Taking smart risks is part of being a successful business-
person. Rather than not taking risks, systematically cataloging, evaluating
and managing your risks, as we discuss in this chapter, can be thought of as
helping you to take the right risks, the ones most likely to pay off. Furthermore,
rather than running around and gathering information about all your risks —
which is difficult to manage and keep updated — technology can help you
out by monitoring and reporting on the risks you want to manage closely.

Chapter 2: Risky Business: Turning Risks into Opportunities

Ignoring Risk (At Your Peril)
If you really wanted to ignore risk, you probably wouldn’t be reading this
chapter. Because you are reading it, we assume you’re at least a little willing
to think about it. There are two approaches to handling risk: You can think
about risk and try to reduce the chances of the risk becoming reality, or you
can choose to not think about risk and just let things happen.
If you notice that the wiring in your house is starting to be a little unreliable,
you might call an electrician. For example, if you’re in the basement and the
children run upstairs, and you see sparks fly, you call an electrician. If you
didn’t pay attention to that risk, when your house catches on fire, you call
the fire department. The risk became a reality — “a loss event.” You might
call this approach firefighting. But wouldn’t it be better to call an electrician
before the situation got to that point? Of course it would. In order for that to
happen, you have to notice the problem and do something about it. You can
prevent that risk and avoid going into firefighting mode.
Many people — and companies — find themselves in a similar type of fire-
fighting, or crisis, mode. Crisis mode is expensive, and depending what the
crisis is, you might have losses from which you can’t recover (old family pic-
tures burned in the fire, for example). An electrician’s bill is lower than the
loss associated with losing your photo albums and other treasures, not to
mention the potential harm to family members and the cost of rebuilding
after the fire. It’s clear that while an electrician’s bill might be high, it’s nowhere
near as high as the cost of the house burning down. In other words, the elec-
trician’s bill offers a good return on investment relative to the risk, which is
an important consideration when evaluating responses to risks.
An effective risk management program helps you foresee problems and pre-
vent or mitigate them. But without effective risk management, the financial
impact can be severe when risks become reality; that is, when incidents or
loss events occur. A recent Deloitte Research study found that in the past
decade, nearly half of all Fortune 1000 companies experienced a loss event
that caused their stock price to decline by 20 percent in one month. Recovery
took a long time — more than a year for half of those affected. Another 22
percent of the companies never recovered their stock value.
Upon further examination, Deloitte found that the loss of stock value was not
the result of a single incident; rather, 80 percent of the losses occurred when
two (or more) risks in different areas of the company turned into loss events
at the same time. Here are some examples of these types of situations:
 A new competitor enters the market at the same time that your supplier
can’t deliver
 A sharp rise in customer returns and complaints occurs at the same
time a competitor introduces a product upgrade
42
Part I: Governance, Risk, and Compliance Demystified 

 Production is stalled because permits for air, water, or waste are exceeded
at the same time that inventory is at a record low and demand is high
Only through systematic monitoring of risks can you see two or more events
coming at the same time and recognize that, if they’re not mitigated in some
way, together they form a real threat to the company’s financial and competi-
tive position. If the number of accidents in a factory is rising at the same time
the scheduled maintenance of equipment is being neglected, the ingredients
for a disaster are brewing. By systematically monitoring risks, you can see
the train wreck before it happens and prevent it.
Sorting Through the Approaches 
to Risk Management
If you really take a firefighting approach to risk, you probably won’t be success-
ful in the long term. But in practice, many companies do take risk seriously
and try to evaluate their risks in one way or another — they just don’t do so
in a systematic way. In this section, we look at some of the possible approaches
to risk management.
The ad hoc approach
The ad hoc approach means that some of the people are thinking about risk,
some of the time. With this approach to risk management, risk assessment is
mainly intuitive. Much of the company’s knowledge about risk is kept in
someone’s head, and no validation of the assumptions surrounding the risk
can be made. If the expert gets a better job offer somewhere, or even changes
teams, all of the risk information is lost. With this approach, you can’t learn
from the mistakes of others. This type of risk management is better than
nothing, but because there’s no shared information, this approach offers no
common vocabulary, it isn’t formalized, and your mileage — and value — will
definitely vary.
The fragmented approach
Another way of thinking about the fragmented approach is that lots of people
are thinking about risk in different ways. In this approach, managers generally
are looking at risk, but they are using their own tools and their own vocabu-
laries or terminology to manage their own organizational or departmental
risks. And in doing so, their management approach is often very informal.
43
Chapter 2: Risky Business: Turning Risks into Opportunities

44
Part I: Governance, Risk, and Compliance Demystified 
Who cares about risk?
In addition to business owners, a variety of
other stakeholders are concerned about risk
and how risks are managed. Here are some of
them:
 Boards of Directors. Boards of directors
worry about risks. You tell the board the
plan, and they ask you, what are the risks?
What do we know about them?
 Investors. Investing is all about risk. Is
investing in this company a good bet, or is it
too risky? If investors are confident that the
company is assessing its risk accurately,
they will be more willing to invest in and
support the growth of the company.
 Companies that provide data for investors.
For example, Standard & Poor’s issues
credit ratings for companies. These ratings
determine how much their bank will charge
them to loan money. Standard & Poor’s now
includes the company’s approach to risk in
its evaluation, so whether a company con-
ducts risk management affects whether it
will be able to borrow money and at what
rate.
 Managers. Good managers also care about
risks: they are often compensated based on
their group’s performance, and risk man-
agement will maximize that performance.
 Regulators. Although the R in GRC has tra-
ditionally been separate from the C (compli-
ance), risk-related regulations are on the
rise: 
Switzerland has passed a law that requires
boards of directors of publicly held compa-
nies to describe their procedures for con-
ducting risk assessments in the notes to
their financial statements. Companies may
instead list the significant risks that they
face.
In Germany, the Act on Control and
Transparency in Enterprises (KonTraG)
specifies that companies must perform risk
management, and they must do so in a way
that allows them to address the risks before
they turn into incidents. Furthermore, they
have to address the risks in a way that
aligns with their corporate objectives.
In the United States, the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and
the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) has published Auditing Standard 
No. 5, which recommends a top-down,
risk–based approach to organizations’ SOX
compliance requirements (assessment of
internal control over financial reporting). As
such, companies are implementing a risk-
based methodology to implement and main-
tain their policy and control environment. 
Even where risk management is not directly
named by regulators, it turns out that you
need effective risk management as part of
the underlying business environment. The
U.S. Amended Sentencing Guidelines state
that organizations must take reasonable
steps to ensure that their compliance and
ethics programs are followed (including
monitoring and auditing to detect criminal
conduct) and must periodically evaluate the
effectiveness of their compliance and
ethics program. Although risk management
is not explicitly stated, analysis of the guide-
lines shows that what is required to meet
the guidelines is basically, in fact, a sys-
tematic approach to managing and moni-
toring risks. 

Commonly, these managers keep Excel spreadsheets filled with risk informa-
tion, but each manager does things differently, making comparisons difficult
or impossible. Furthermore, the frequency of updates may vary widely, with
the sales department conducting risk assessments quarterly while the devel-
opment organization does them once a year.
This siloed approach means that you have no way of aggregating data about
risk. Because you can’t aggregate the data, you can’t really gain an enterprise
view of risk, either. There is no transparency of the risks at an enterprise level,
and generally any formal focus on risk management is on the negative aspect
of risk, rather than a proactive approach to strategic risk management.
This fragmented approach to risk, with everyone doing their own thing, creates
a false sense of security. You think your organization is managing risk, but in
fact, the organization lacks any visibility or insight into common business sit-
uations with regard to risk. With this approach, you can’t really protect value
or create value. The only real perspective offered is historical, and managing
a business based solely on a historical perspective doesn’t allow a business
to move forward.
The risk manager’s job approach
With the risk manager’s job approach, some people are appointed to think
about risk some of the time. With this approach, the company believes it is
taking risk seriously because it has hired or appointed a risk manager. The
risk manager then has the job of gathering information from all the line of
business managers, meeting with them to discuss their risks, and working
with them to provide ongoing risk-related information. This approach does
have some merit because it indicates that risk is taken seriously and is given
the support of management. If this is the only approach your business takes,
however, it can lead to isolated support for risk management, which at best
can yield only isolated benefits. Another danger of this approach is that line
of business experts generally only communicate their risk information rather
than taking responsibility for managing their risks: They report the information
up the chain and then consider their job done. They don’t take responsibility
for mitigating and managing the risks; after all, they think, that’s the risk man-
ager’s job. 
The systematic, enterprise-wide approach
Another way of thinking about the systematic, enterprise wide approach is to
say that this approach means that the right people are thinking about the
right risks at the right time. The infrastructure and processes that have 
45
Chapter 2: Risky Business: Turning Risks into Opportunities

historically served risk management are now straining under the weight of a
global economy in which change is a constant and information travels at the
speed of light. Companies are increasingly putting into place an enterprise-
level methodology for thinking about risk.
Such an approach provides a framework for analyzing and managing risks in
the context of corporate strategy and performance, for gaining an under-
standing of the true exposures relating from risk correlation, and for com-
plete transparency so that risks can be effectively managed at the right 
time. By agreeing on a common vocabulary, a unified catalog of risk types, a
common methodology for assessing the probability of risks occurring and 
a formal remediation or response methodology, companies can take a more
strategic view of their risks, and risk can become a driver of the business to
help enable performance and innovation.
Without the help of a system that can help you automate monitoring of risks,
however, even a common methodology and a risk-aware culture won’t really
help you protect your brand value, let alone create value. If the market finds
out about loss events before or at the same time that you do, and that news
is published through the media, it’s already too late. Risk management today
needs to provide automated monitoring of key risk indicators as soon as cer-
tain thresholds are reached so that relevant risk information is constantly
being identified, analyzed, and managed before the risks become loss events
and negatively impact the business.
With this type of automated risk monitoring, different scenarios can be mod-
eled for future projects or products and these scenarios can be effectively
risk-adjusted and managed, supporting intelligent choices about strategic
directions. For example, if a salesperson enters a large quote, there is a risk
that the sale won’t close (and an even bigger risk if we are counting too much
on the success of that sale). With automated risk monitoring, that large quote
can trigger an e-mail to the salesperson with a few questions to help charac-
terize the risks associated with the deal. In this way, risks can be collected
and updated as part of standard operating procedure, rather than relying on
someone to get around to updating their risks. 
A cultural approach
In a cultural approach, all of the people thinking about risk some of the time.
Face it: line of business managers and their teams have the best view of the
risks in their particular areas. Creating a culture in which risks are reported,
managed, and monitored by each of the business units is powerful, particularly
if reporting is easy to do. The responsibility for managing risks — because they
have a direct impact on business performance — must stay with the line of
business.
46
Part I: Governance, Risk, and Compliance Demystified 

Part of this involves instilling in the culture a way to think about risk. It’s clear
that we live in uncertain times. By taking this uncertainty into account —
rather than ignoring it — we can incorporate risk into the complete business
cycle of strategy- and objective-setting, business planning and budgeting, exe-
cuting against plan, and measuring performance.
Identifying the Critical Components of a
Successful Risk Management Framework
As you might have guessed, all of the approaches to risk management that we
discussed in the previous section are not mutually exclusive. In this section,
we combine the best of these approaches to see what it takes to build a suc-
cessful risk management framework. A successful enterprise risk management
framework requires four components:
 Making risk part of the culture from the top level down
 Building an organization to help with risk
 Instituting a systematic framework for dealing with risk
 Using technology to automate the monitoring and the management of
risks 
In the next few sections, we unpack each of these components in more detail.
A culture that takes risk seriously, 
from the C-suite down
Building risk into the culture doesn’t mean having employees hang-gliding off
the roof of corporate headquarters. What it does mean is that there is support
for risk management that starts at the top with the C-level executives, includ-
ing the CEO, CFO, and COO. This level of risk buy-in is critical. Further, if the
company puts a policy in place and an employee violates it, a response from
C-level executives to the whole company helps to clarify that this initiative is
to be taken seriously. C-level execs have to hold themselves to the same stan-
dards that they expect of their employees; they must build risk analyses into
their own decision-making.
One effective way for the C-suite to help build a culture of risk management is
in creating a formalized risk policy — communicating their expectations to all
employees and setting standards for how often risk management and report-
ing must be done.
47
Chapter 2: Risky Business: Turning Risks into Opportunities

The C-level executives guide the company regarding its objectives and plans.
This information is critical in developing an effective risk management frame-
work. After all, if you don’t know where you’re going, it’s hard to figure out
what might try to stop you or slow you down.
Strategy and planning starts at the top, but it builds on input from the whole
company. Line of business executives do their budgets as input to the corpo-
rate budget. Plans and objectives are set at the top, but also at the depart-
mental level.
48
Part I: Governance, Risk, and Compliance Demystified 
Reticence about risk
Not all corporate cultures are willing to talk
about risk. Here are some attitudes that prevent
frank discussion of risk:
Risk is negative. Some people think that risk is
negative and so, in order to be “positive,” they
avoid discussions of risk. Such thinking reflects
an outdated understanding of risk in which risk
is viewed as something bad rather than as a
positive force that can both protect value and
actually create value by helping companies find
new opportunities and manage those opportu-
nities effectively.
I don’t want to be the bearer of bad news. If we
have a corporate policy of shooting messen-
gers, there will be some fear about bringing up
what can go wrong. This requires cultural rein-
forcement that we want to know what the risks
are: how the deal could possibly fall through,
what factors might cause the product to be late,
or whether our supplier is showing signs of
instability and may not be able to supply. The
point to make here is that we are trying to take
into account all risks at an early stage to see
how we can mitigate the risk and increase our
chances of success. Remember that even
promising new business opportunities can be a
risk if we don’t prepare for the increased capac-
ity that success will require.
If you know my risks, you know my strategy.
Who wouldn’t like to be in the other team’s locker
room and find out what plays the coach is plan-
ning to use in the Super Bowl? Information about
risks is strategic, so it must be treated as privi-
leged information, just like any other aspect of
corporate strategy. For this reason, although you
want risk to be part of the culture, you have to
think about who is trustworthy enough to have
the complete picture of all the risks. Educating
people about risk should include a vetting
process that employees go through before being
included in risk management discussions.
Furthermore, risk information may sometimes fall
under attorney-client privilege and thus must be
managed within the legal department; it’s impor-
tant to support this kind of clear authorization.
I can’t let my risk managers network. Risk man-
agers obviously must be discreet and savvy
enough to know what they can network about
and what they can’t. Although risk information
is strategic, competing companies face many 
of the same risks, particularly regarding com-
pliance with the ever-increasing number of reg-
ulations. Networking about best practices —
while not revealing corporate secrets — is 
key to developing in-house expertise in risk
management.

In much the same way, line of business managers generally can see certain
risks most clearly. That’s why managing risk is everyone’s business: The com-
posite of all those unique perspectives creates the most complete picture of
the risks that the company faces and helps pinpoint the most strategic risks
to consider.
To get even more specific about what moving risk into the culture really means,
Table 2-1 lists various roles and responsibilities to consider for helping them
integrate risk.
Table 2-1
Moving Risk into the Culture, Role by Role
Executives
Executives should view risk management as a critical part of 
performance management. Risk should be considered when 
deciding which corporate strategies to pursue (such as merg-
ers and acquisitions, new product development, and the like). 
Once the strategy is set, executives need to review the top risks 
and monitor the key risk indicators for meeting each of the com-
pany objectives.
Based on the new transparency of risks across the enterprise, 
create risk-adjusted proformas for what-if analyses and 
scenario testing.
Benefit: Executives gain transparency across all enterprise 
risks that can help them be proactive, because they can view 
the most up-to-date risk data in dashboards, reports and alerts.
Risk managers
Risk managers are able to leverage all the data currently in their 
enterprise systems so the risks can be automatically identified 
and monitored.
The professional risk management team needs a single platform 
to automate risk management processes across the disparate 
systems within their enterprise. They need an open framework 
to integrate other systems to provide an end-to-end risk 
process across the extended enterprise of customers, suppli-
ers, and partners. This also includes manual processes. Rather 
than trying to fight collaboration done manually using the 
phone, email, and spreadsheets, the risk management 
processes should incorporate these tools automatically into 
risk management processes.
Benefit: By taking this approach, risk managers will be able to 
focus on collecting and analyzing important risk information, 
and become strategic advisors to the business units.

Table 2-1 (continued)
Line of business 
Line of business managers need tools to be able to drive their 
managers
performance and respond to their top risks to help them 
achieve their objectives. 
They need company- and role-based risk best practice play-
books. Line of business experts should be provided with guides 
that help them identify risks that often occur within business 
processes, provide potential mitigation and management strate-
gies, and include benchmark assumptions and setup of risk 
monitoring processes.
Companies can learn from the experiences of these users, 
examining which responses were effective in the past so that 
they can avoid making mistakes twice. 
Benefit: Line of business managers start to own and drive risk 
management for their areas, a true sign that risk management 
is now part of the culture.
A risk management organization:
Distributing responsibility 
throughout the culture
Even if risk is part of the company culture, someone needs to be minding the
store, ensuring that risk information is being gathered and updated so that it
can properly inform corporate decisions large and small. Appointing a corpo-
rate risk manager can help ensure that risk management is given the attention
and focus it requires.
As with any type of corporate messaging, having someone in charge helps
ensure that the message is delivered and is owned by the business units. Risk
managers should have as part of their objectives the goal of building a risk-
aware organization. Effective risk management should permeate the organiza-
tion, providing vertical visibility from the top management to the line of
business managers and their workers. Risk management professionals should
push responsibility for risk down to the level of line of business owners. In
this way, risks can be rolled up and monitored at other levels as needed.
You can easily see how risk managers can help the company manage risks by
pushing responsibility down into the organization. What’s a little more subtle
is the horizontal visibility that this ultimately provides.
By monitoring, managing, and documenting risks and risk response actions,
the company builds a pool of experience in managing risks. Managers can
learn how to better manage, and even model, risks in their own organization,
50
Part I: Governance, Risk, and Compliance Demystified 

but also the experience of how one division can benefit another. A manager in
one division can learn from the experience of those in other parts of the com-
pany. Risk expertise accrues and the experience of the company as a whole is
leveraged. Managers learn not only from their own experience but also from
the experience of others in a very real and tangible way.
51
Chapter 2: Risky Business: Turning Risks into Opportunities
Regulatory risks are diverse: All hands on deck
Companies today must comply with many differ-
ent regulations, and that means monitoring many
kinds of risks to achieve a holistic approach to
GRC. Because the risks are so diverse, neither
corporate risk managers nor the C-suite execu-
tives can have a complete handle on them. Line
of business owners must monitor and manage
these risks, often with the help of experts in the
organization. Here are some of the types of risks
that must be monitored:
Environment, Health, & Safety Risks
The environment, health, and safety (EH&S)
umbrella contains many risks that pose potential
threats to your employees and your company. If
you don’t comply with EH&S regulations, not only
do you expose your employees to unnecessary
harm, but you potentially face significant fines
and penalties, disruption to production, and
damage to your company reputation. However, if
you manage EH&S issues effectively, you can
lower your operating costs and ensure the safety
of your employees. See Chapter 10 for more
details on this type of risk.
The Risk of Noncompliance with Emissions
Regulations 
A related operational risk for many companies
is emissions control. The potential for political,
financial, and public image fallout for noncom-
pliance with regulations such as the Kyoto
Protocol, the U.S. Clean Air Act, or the EU IPPC
Directive is enormous. Noncompliance with
greenhouse gas emissions regulations poses an
even greater risk to brand image and corporate
goodwill for companies that operate complex,
multifaceted manufacturing facilities. See
Chapter 11 for more details on this type of risk.
The Risk of Noncompliance with Financial
Regulations
The passing of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)
means that institutional investors, rating agen-
cies, and regulators have started assessing
GRC management as part of their evaluation of
companies. Furthermore, the stakes for non-
compliance with financial regulations such as
SOX have become more than just fines and
penalties. Stock valuations and credit ratings
can be affected by your inability to comply with
mandated regulations. There are numerous
other laws to consider as well in this category,
including those dealing with security and pri-
vacy, as well as your responsibility for your part-
ners, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
See Chapters 4 through 7 for more information
on this type of risk.
Global Trade Risks
Security concerns of the post-9/11 era have
spawned a host of new trade and transport reg-
ulations. To ensure that you are not trading with
any entities on government-issued “watch lists”
or “sanctioned party lists,” you need to identify
your business partners — and their outsourcing
suppliers — throughout your global supply chain.
Noncompliance with these trade regulations can
be expensive; in extreme cases companies have
even had their trade licenses or privileges
revoked. See Chapter 8 for more information on
global trade risks.

The risk manager’s role, then, becomes like that of another business owner,
helping the organization improve its wall-to-wall risk awareness and risk man-
agement approach. The risk manager can also help develop best practices.
It’s important to send a message that risk managers support the corporation
in risk management, not that they “handle” risk management. Human resources
supports the organization with detailed information about health insurance
and the like. But employees have to file their own health claims and know
what coverage they have. Similarly, risk professionals support risk manage-
ment but they cannot possibly have the breadth of knowledge of all the risks
that people across the organization have. Risk is everyone’s job.
A systematic framework in place
Because you’re looking for consistency and comparability in your approach
to risk management, you need a systematic approach to gathering and man-
aging that information. One way to do this is by adopting an enterprise risk
management framework that leverages technology to collect, monitor, and
manage the key risk information. The important factor here is to put measures
in place that drive consistency so that everyone is not out there creating
apples-and-oranges spreadsheets that, though perhaps wonderful on a depart-
mental level, are impossible to compare with the kumquats-and-cucumbers
spreadsheets produced by another division.
This systematic framework also sets boundaries for the type of risk manage-
ment the company will do. It answers the following types of questions:
 How quantitative does the analysis need to be?
 Which areas of the business are we going to include?
 Which types of risks are we going to monitor?
 What are the key risk indicators associated with those risks?
Technology that creates a risk picture
The final component you need is a technology infrastructure that provides an
ability to manage and communicate all components of risk and response. A
good technology infrastructure should
 Automate the collection, analysis, monitoring, and response of risk-related
information
52
Part I: Governance, Risk, and Compliance Demystified 

 Monitor key systems across business processes to ensure real-time iden-
tification and management of key risks. Raise alerts when key figures
reach preset thresholds (for example, a 5 percent increase in use of a
single-sourced material) 
 Incorporate risk evaluation into corporate strategy and planning so busi-
ness units have visibility into key risks before it is too late
A risk management technology platform provides the foundation for stronger
collaboration and understanding across the enterprise. By having a common
set of risk content embedded in the technology solution, lines of business
managers can now manage risk by using a common system to classify risk.
Doing this drives more strategic integration across departments in managing
the interdependencies of risks. Each department is now working against
aligned risk management goals and objectives, which are enforced at the
underlying technology layer. Such a technology infrastructure can help a cor-
poration manage risk as it seeks to protect value (by monitoring and mitigat-
ing its risks) and create value (by marrying risk information to strategy).
Taking the Four Steps to Enterprise 
Risk Management
Enterprise risk management means that risk management is not an isolated
activity: An enterprise-wide approach includes all risks and takes input from
across the enterprise. Enterprise risk management also means that risk is also
seen as a strategic opportunity, not just a tactical program to mitigate the
effect of loss events. Managing risks can be aligned with corporate strategy:
Rather than reviewing an endless list of risks and developing tactical remedia-
tion plans, risks can be proactively and strategically managed in light of what
the company is trying to achieve short-term and long-term. 
With that framework in place, you’re ready to get down to the process for
enterprise risk management, which is comprised of four large steps:
 Risk planning: For each business activity, what are we trying to achieve,
what are the assumptions and constraints, and what risks do we want to
monitor?
 Risk identification and analysis: For each business activity, we identify
the risks. For each risk we look at the nature of the risk, its probability of
occurrence, and the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the risk. 
 Risk response: Is there anything we can do to reduce, mitigate, or even
remove the risk? How much will this cost? What is the potential ROI of
taking this step? Who’s responsible for making sure that the response
happens?
53
Chapter 2: Risky Business: Turning Risks into Opportunities

 Risk monitoring: In this step, we continuously track and monitor each
of the risks and analyze any risks that, despite our efforts, turn into 
incidents.
Unlike other processes where you follow the steps and you’re done, enterprise
risk management is an ongoing and perpetual process, so the final step circles
back to the first step, as shown in Figure 2-2.
The bottom line is that this process provides you with “news you can use”:
actionable information that helps you make better decisions and removes
roadblocks from the projects that are important to you.
Risk planning
Risk planning is a first step in any enterprise risk management process. It typ-
ically involves defining the boundaries of the risk assessment, deciding who
should participate, and capturing any assumptions or constraints about the
business activity. The planning process also helps organizations establish
their risk appetite and risk thresholds and helps them define their process 
to manage their risks more strategically and effectively.
Proper risk planning helps drive consistency across the organization in terms
of how risks are defined and managed. Part of the planning process is to
ensure that risks are aligned with corporate goals. A historical challenge of
risk management was that risks have not been aligned with corporate strat-
egy, and therefore management of these risks did not proactively and strate-
gically support the enterprise.
Figure 2-2:
The Risk
Manage-
ment
Process.
54
Part I: Governance, Risk, and Compliance Demystified 

Risk identification and analysis
The next step is to identify and analyze all of the risks to the business. For each
risk, the goal is to analyze the impact of the particular risk occurring and quan-
tify the risk, both in terms of likelihood (probability) and in terms of potential
loss (impact). It is important in this phase to collaborate and aggregate across
the enterprise to ensure that all risks are identified, as well as ensuring an
understanding of the impact of the risks and any associated loss event.
You should consider two key attributes when analyzing risk:
 Probability: How likely is it to happen? Think about the weather as an
example. A popular weather site includes an hour-by-hour probability of
precipitation. But some possible weather conditions are, well, less possi-
ble than others. On a dry July day in Washington, D.C., for example, the
risk of heavy rain is characterized as minimal. But the risk of heavy snow
and ice buildup is also said to be minimal. In D.C., rain is far more likely
than snow in July, but these events are categorized as being equally prob-
able. Assign a probability to your risks as accurately as you can. (Perhaps
because of its sensitivity to the issue of quantifying risks, this same
weather site now assigns a percentage probability to various weather
events, listing a 0 percent chance of snow in July in Washington, D.C.)
 Impact: What will happen if this risk becomes reality? What will be the
consequence? It could be significant; it could be catastrophic. Where
possible, estimate the risk in terms of monetary value. Bear in mind that
some risks, like possible loss of human life, are qualitative instead; you
can’t put a price on someone’s life (unless you’re an insurance company).
By quantifying the risks and determining a probability of their occurrence,
management can see what risks are either most likely or are associated with
the highest potential loss. Identification and analysis yields a short list of
your most critical risks, the ones that really have an impact. If those risks can
be reduced or mitigated in some way, the bottom line will look a lot healthier.
Risk response is the next step to consider.
Risk response
After you know what the risks are and what the potential losses could be, you
have to think about what you can do about them. The risk response phase
primarily deals with balancing the cost of risk avoidance and opportunity.
Risk response allows you to develop and manage resolution strategies for
critical risks that could significantly impact the business. Part of this is being
able to identify interdependencies between risks across the organization. For
55
Chapter 2: Risky Business: Turning Risks into Opportunities

example, a risk of a supplier going bankrupt could cause associated risks
within the sales and marketing organizations. A response process also allows
the line of business owners to effectively manage their risks. Risk response
helps business owners identify and implement the appropriate technology or
processes to manage the impact of a loss event to their line of business. Now,
there are some risks you can’t do anything about if you didn’t anticipate them,
such as an earthquake, hurricane, or a big change in the economy: These you
just have to accept. But in many cases, you can select a response that allows
you to better manage the impact of these risks. In fact, when submitting risks
to managers, employees may also provide what they view as some possible
responses and even quantify how those responses could help.
The type of quantitative analysis mentioned in the identification and analysis
step can be used to compare the return on investment of various responses,
which may be used in combination or separately. Based on the return on
investment, you may decide to choose one response over another.
Every response is recorded in the enterprise risk management framework,
whether it actually prevents the risk or not. The next time someone is faced
with a similar question like this, she can look at the experience of others to
discover whether hiring more people, one possible approach to a project in
trouble, actually helped. (Hiring people doesn’t always help; for example,
consider the classic question: If one woman can have a baby in 9 months, 
can 9 women have a baby in one month?) If your organization is using spread-
sheets, this information might be on someone’s laptop rather than in your
enterprise risk management framework, where it can be informative to others
who are managing similar risks.
Part of managing risks is looking at what best practices suggest. If you don’t
have much experience yet, consultants can be helpful in providing input. But
with enterprise risk management, whether you get outside help or not, you
begin to harness everyone’s experience in a systematic way, building your
own database of best practices. 
Any risk response has a status. It’s all well and good to say that you will hire
three more people to help with a project, but if you don’t have three people
to hire, the status has to reflect this fact. Depending how hard it is to find
qualified help, the response might not be as effective as you had hoped. The
status of the risk has to be updated periodically so that the risk can be prop-
erly monitored, which is the next phase to consider. 
Risk monitoring
After you’ve decided what kinds of risks you want to consider, quantified them
in terms of likelihood and potential loss, and considered your responses, the
next step is to monitor them, analyzing the information you have from a
number of perspectives.
56
Part I: Governance, Risk, and Compliance Demystified 

For example, what classes of risks are causing the most problems? This may
point us in a strategic direction for change. Are there any changes in the risk
levels? Are some business units going beyond the risk appetites or thresholds
set for them by management? Is the information on the risks being monitored?
Monitoring can happen in several ways, but one popular way to present it, if
you are using enterprise risk management software, is through a risk dash-
board. Risk dashboards can be presented at multiple levels based on the
target audience, including C-level executives, risk managers, or even line of
business owners. The information contained within the dashboards can be
aggregated to track and monitor multiple risk elements or can present only
the risk information that a given role needs to monitor or is interested in. 
Risk monitoring frequency depends on many things, but here are a few to
consider:
 Priority of the risk (“high priority risks could be updated or monitored
daily or weekly, depending on the impact”)
 Company or regulatory policy (“all risks are reviewed every quarter”)
 Frequency of new information (“earthquake” (no new information) vs.
“product development timeline” (new information after each R&D team
meeting)) 
Analyzing What Went Wrong: 
When Risk Becomes Reality
A certain proportion of risks are going to become loss events: That’s just how
life works. Products are delayed, some sales are lost, a new competitor steps
in on the scene, or a key component for our product is stuck in customs
somewhere.
Enterprise risk management can help you understand and better manage a
loss event. By analyzing this incident and reviewing what went wrong, you
can see whether the risk could have been prevented or its impact reduced if
certain measures had been taken sooner. By analyzing and managing these
incidents in a systematic way, you have the opportunity to avoid additional
problems in the future.
With incident analysis, you look at factors like:
 What went wrong?
 What caused the problem to occur?
 Was this a risk that was even being tracked? 
57
Chapter 2: Risky Business: Turning Risks into Opportunities

 What were the costs of managing the risks and implementing a response
plan compared to the costs of the incident?
 What was the nature of the loss? Was it a financial loss? An opportunity
loss?
 What was the root cause? Is our product out of date or not suited for the
current market? Were our people (sales or support) unfriendly or
unhelpful? 
 What response strategies did we try and why didn’t they work? Maybe
they did work, but not as well as you hoped. In either case, you need to
know what went wrong where and how you can do better next time.
Incidents have much to teach you, and doing an analysis of what went wrong
is important to making more things go right in the future.
Automating the Risk Management Cycle
So far in this chapter, we’ve talked about managing risks in a manual way. How-
ever, the process of monitoring risks can be automated as well by implement-
ing an enterprise risk management software application. For example, if you
enter a lead for a potential sale with a dollar value above a certain amount,
the enterprise risk management software could alert the key participants
about the risk, or even implement a workflow to send a survey to document
the key risk information regarding the deal. Once submitted, that survey
could be sent to the risk manager or to your manager, depending on how it
has been set up, and key risk indicators against this risk could be automati-
cally monitored. This implies a level of integration between the software you
use to track leads and your enterprise risk management software.
Taking the SAP Approach: SAP 
GRC Risk Management
The SAP application that supports this enterprise approach to risk manage-
ment is called SAP GRC Risk Management. This application is integrated with
all other SAP applications, making it easy to raise alerts about key business
processes right from the software itself. Monitoring these risks is a key fea-
ture of SAP GRC Risk Management.

SAP GRC risk management 
and key risk indicators
You may have heard of KPIs — key performance indicators — that help com-
panies and employees track progress toward their goals. Key risk indicators
(KRIs) provide the same kind of metric, but in the realm of risk. KRIs tell you
that if a certain risk is realized, it represents a significant problem. SAP GRC
Risk Management provides automatic KRI monitoring. Furthermore, as shown
in Figure 2-3, KRIs are related to risk targets and thresholds, making it very
concrete that if a certain metric reaches a certain level, the risk owner must
be notified.
Figure 2-3 highlights how KRI monitoring helps drive and automate the risk
management process.
The process of KRI monitoring starts with identifying the key risk indicators:
 What are the top key risk indicators that could affect your business
processes?
 Which of your business processes or activities are “worth” tracking from
a risk management perspective?
 What are your company’s goals and how do risks align to those? How do
they differ by line of business?
The next step is to set thresholds for each KRI using configurable business
rules. For example:

ment.

Chapter 2: Risky Business: Turning Risks into Opportunities

 Setting a level (for example, more than three injuries in a quarter)
 Monitoring percentage increase or decrease (for example, a 5 percent
increase in unplanned manufacturing downtime) or percentage by
volume (more than 0.5 percent customer complaints per product
shipped)
If any of these thresholds are reached or exceeded — more than three
injuries in a quarter for example — an alert is raised so that the situation
receives immediate follow up.
Finally, the risk appetite for each line of business and for the enterprise as a
whole needs to be documented. How much loss can the business absorb
based on current capitalization? It may make sense for some parts of your
business to take more risks (in a product line, for example) while other lines
of businesses, which provide a steady revenue stream — your cash cows —
will be managed more conservatively.
Monitoring risks and key risk indicators
with SAP GRC Risk Management
Here are some situations where you could use SAP GRC Risk Management to
monitor risks and the associated key risk indicators:
 Mass exodus. SAP GRC Risk Management integrates with SAP Human
Capital Management so that you can generate an alert if key people from
the same group are leaving the company, perhaps because they are being
wooed by a competitor.
 Accidents on the rise. SAP GRC Risk Management integrates with SAP
Environment, Health & Safety, so you can raise an alert if an accident 
(or two of the same type) occurs, indicating a safety problem.
 Projects are late; deals hang in the balance. The new product release is
key to several important sales deals. SAP GRC Risk Management inte-
grates with SAP Project System and SAP Customer Relationship
Management so you can receive alerts both on the status of the project
and on the revenue that depends on its timely delivery.
 Supplier reliability on the wane. Maybe your suppliers usually deliver
on time, but that on time delivery is slowly falling behind. SAP GRC Risk
Management, working with SAP ERP, can alert you to this trend — before
it becomes a problem.
 Entering a new market. One possible risk is noncompliance with trade
regulations for that market. SAP GRC Risk Management integrates with
SAP Global Trade Services, so you could choose to receive alerts when
60
Part I: Governance, Risk, and Compliance Demystified 

export declarations are being rejected due to improper product classifi-
cations for customs.
 Maintaining a safe working environment. For example, a mining com-
pany is required to maintain equipment according to safety standards.
Safety equipment is scheduled for periodic inspections. SAP GRC Risk
Management integrates with SAP ERP, so you could choose to receive
alerts when inspections are not conducted on time. 
 Meeting government reporting requirements. Think of a pharmaceutical
company that is required to follow FDA regulations, including procedures
on how to conduct clinical trials. You could choose to set up an alert
that monitors data in SAP HCM that shows whether each relevant
employee has successfully completed training in clinical trial document
submission. 
 Changes in your competition. Your largest customer is going through 
a merger and acquisition process and the merging company buys from
your biggest competitor. You need to get an alert of all sales activities
and start to determine ways to manage the risk of losing this customer
due to the merger. SAP GRC Risk Management is integrated with SAP
CRM, so it can alert you to all relevant sales activities.
 Market fluctuation. You do 25 percent of your sales in Brazil and need
to monitor the fluctuation rate of the real (BRL). You set up a key risk
indicator to monitor the risk of booking a deal on a day when the real is
below the monthly average so that you are alerted about how currency
fluctuation impacts contract bookings. This could represent a difference
of $1 million in the contract booking, so you might want to wait until the
rate is more favorable to book the contract if you can.
Using SAP GRC Risk Management: 
A Fictional Case Study
To see how SAP GRC Risk Management works in the real world, we’ve created
a fictional case study. Plastic Time, a fictional plastics manufacturing company,
produces styrene, and the CEO has been asked if they can fill an order for 2
million pounds in 30 days — a tight deadline that requires a quick answer.
Because Apslcom (a fictional customer) is a prospect the company has been
pursuing for some time, Plastic Time is very interested in making the sale.
But to evaluate the opportunity intelligently, Plastic Time’s CEO asks the
management team to factor in all the risks so that he can give the client a
solid answer to its inquiry. He also asks them to include the corporate risk
manager in the analysis process. 
61
Chapter 2: Risky Business: Turning Risks into Opportunities

Where should we produce?
Three possible plants could produce the styrene: one in China, Romania, and
in the U.S. Whichever plant is chosen, Plastic Time needs assurance that it
can ramp up production very quickly and get the necessary supplies. The
planning team performs a quick analysis of the ramp-up scenarios and from 
a pure cost standpoint, China seems to be the best choice. The general man-
ager assembles the management team to quickly convene and evaluate the
Chinese plant from a risk standpoint.
Considering China
At the meeting, the Chief Risk Officer shows the management team the GRC
Risk Management Dashboard. The dashboard shows how all the risks affect
each other and provide a complete picture of the risks the Chinese plant
faces. All the risks are linked to KRIs that the software automatically updates,
so the management team is viewing the latest risk information for the plant. 
The CRO uses the assessment capability to see the impact of adding a job for
producing 2 million pounds of styrene in 30 days. She also sends out a survey
by e-mail to the key line managers to get their input on the risks involved in
giving this job to the Chinese plant. It appears that high-level risks such as
the global economy are under control for that timeframe. The survey results
indicate that the risks in the area of suppliers will require further assessment.
After all, suppliers are key to filling the order on time. The CRO asks her team
to conduct a fast assessment that includes suppliers, timeframes, deadlines,
and deliverables and all the risks related to these factors.
The additional assessment shows that increasing staffing and responsibility
will not be a problem for this plant. However, the results also show that the
Chinese plant is currently struggling with a key supplier, and shows a 58 per-
cent probability risk that the key supplier will not be able to meet this new
demand, which would incur a loss of $15.6 billion due to penalties and
unsaleable inventory if the decision were made to produce there.
The management team asks about alternative suppliers for the plant, but the
Chinese team has already started working with a new supplier, which is 
currently ramping up production and is expecting to come online in about
four months — too late to help with the Apslcom deadline. Considering yet
another supplier would require getting import licenses, and given the time-
frame, that won’t work either. The CRO shows how GRC Global Trade Services
shows that the cost of an expedited effort in China makes China actually the
most expensive location for the job — the opposite of what the initial calcula-
tions showed. (For more on SAP GRC Global Trade Services, see Chapter 8.)
In addition, SAP GRC Risk Management shows that there’s a 50 percent
chance that the job wouldn’t get done on time, regardless of the cost.
62
Part I: Governance, Risk, and Compliance Demystified 

Considering Romania
China is clearly not the best choice, and the U.S. plant is both costly and over-
booked by comparison, so the team looks at the plant in Romania. The Chief
Risk Officer reviews the top two risks for Romania, which are financial and
environmental. Data for this plant indicates a lower level of supply chain
risks, and the line of business managers there do not indicate any additional
production problems. However, the increased revenue from this job will put
the plant over the compliance audit threshold, placing higher compliance
costs on the company; however, U.S. compliance processes and controls will
be leveraged to minimize the risk and the impact of the additional compliance
requirements. The increased revenue substantially offsets the cost of the addi-
tional compliance requirements, given that these requirements can be met
efficiently because of the SAP GRC implementation that is already in place.
The second risk to be considered is environmental. What are the current
carbon targets in Romania based on the new production limits? SAP GRC Risk
Management automatically monitors the key environmental risk indicators
and shows that the Romanian plant falls below emissions permit limits even
with the expected increase in production. There is no risk of having to apply
for new permits or buy emissions credits.
After finishing this evaluation, the team settles on the Romanian plant and
creates a draft of the operational plan. The CRO then works to get all of the
risks and mitigation plans into GRC Risk Management so that progress on 
the job can be monitored.
The bottom line is that Plastic Time can make a confident reply to Apslcom,
assuring the client it can handle the job (and confident that it makes good
business sense, too).
Using SAP Risk Management: 
An SAP Case Study
When Henning Kagermann became CEO of SAP AG, he wanted to know how
risks were being identified, reported, and managed within the company. What
he found was pretty typical. Everyone at SAP said, yes, we track our risks, and
here are the spreadsheets we use.
As you might suspect, risks were being managed in a fragmented and ad hoc
manner. Everyone did it in their own way, and in most cases, their methodol-
ogy was sound, but the result was far from systematic or even comparable in
any rigorous way.
63
Chapter 2: Risky Business: Turning Risks into Opportunities

The idea for creating SAP GRC Risk Management was born, to give SAP the
ability to identify and manage their own risks within their own business. The
benefits SAP realized by implementing SAP GRC Risk Management solutions
are quantifiable in several ways:
 Cost savings: Time is money, and now SAP spends approximately 30 per-
cent less time managing risk activities centrally and throughout the busi-
ness (previously, SAP employees spent this time manually completing
and tracking risk assessments, consolidating assessments, and rolling
up and generating reports).
 Reduced insurance premiums: Because SAP is monitoring its risks sys-
tematically, insurance companies can reduce their premiums. Using SAP
GRC Risk Management drove down insurance costs, saving the company
$4 million annually in insurance premiums. Because of automatic KRI
monitoring, fewer risks result in incidents, and there are fewer claims.
“Prior to the implementation, we had an average of 7 to 10 claims per
year within our Americas region alone,” says George Haitsch, Vice
President Corporate Risk, Global Risk Management, SAP AG. “Now we
average just 2 to 4 claims annually for the entire SAP Group.” 
 Risk management as competitive advantage: SAP GRC Risk Management
has made SAP AG a tougher and savvier competitor. “All loss events
impact the bottom line, making us less profitable,” states Phil Morin,
senior director of risk management, SAP AG. “If we reduce the number 
of loss events, we have more money to invest in areas such as research
and development @md and that’s got to be good news for our customers.”
 Monitoring important KRIs: Part of the competitive advantage derives
from the ability to important information such as the sales pipeline, new
project launch status, and the effectiveness of internal controls.
Gleaning the Benefits of SAP 
GRC Risk Management
SAP GRC Risk Management enables businesses to understand the true nature
and exposure of enterprise risks. Benefits include increased visibility into risks,
the ability to leverage existing data throughout the enterprise, the ability to
align risk management with strategy, and the ability to make better decisions.
 Increase visibility: SAP GRC Risk Management enables and automates the
cross-enterprise identification, monitoring, and mitigation of risks across
lines of business. It provides visibility and transparency of risks across the
enterprise to allow organizations to be more accountable and make more
effective risk-based business decisions.
64
Part I: Governance, Risk, and Compliance Demystified 

 Leverage all the information, everywhere: SAP GRC Risk Management
taps into the vast data stores of the systems in your SAP landscape, but
doesn’t stop there. It can embrace information in non-SAP enterprise
applications as well as incorporating unstructured risk information held
in other ERP systems, e-mail systems, spreadsheets, and documents. It
automatically collects and aggregates all risk-relevant information at an
enterprise level, creating a single repository for ERM. This consolidated
information matures over time into a database of the company’s experi-
ence, learning, and best practices for dealing with risks, helping you
avoid making the same mistakes twice, even in different divisions. 
 Consolidate risk management and strategy management: SAP GRC Risk
Management aligns risk management with corporate strategy. Effective
strategy management requires a consolidated view of objectives, under-
lying strategy execution initiatives, KPIs, and related risks. The synergy
between risk management and strategy is further considered in Chapter 15. 
 Better, more informed decision-making: SAP GRC Risk Management
provides you with the information you need to make better decisions
that take into account important risk factors. SAP GRC Risk Management
allows you to conduct what-if scenarios, allowing you to factor in multi-
ple scenarios to help you see how various market conditions and other
variables could impact your plans. Relationships between data elements
are dynamic; adjust the KRI thresholds for various areas and the risk
forecasting automatically adjusts itself. Constant, real-time monitoring 
of KRIs provides confidence that the risk information you use to help
you make solid decisions reflects the current state of all risks.
SAP GRC Risk Management gives you proactive and risk-adjusted management
of enterprise performance, providing the tools you’ll need to compete effec-
tively in the future.

Governance: GRC in Action
In This Chapter
 Getting to know the ropes of governance
 Creating a governance plan
 Maintaining a good governance framework
I
n the past few chapters, we examined the R (risk) and the C (compliance)
of GRC. In a nutshell, risk not only deals with what could go wrong, but
also where a sophisticated and enterprising company might be able to divine
opportunities. Examining risk involves finding the lemons and maybe some
water and sugar to make fresh lemonade. Compliance, on the other hand, is
doing what you are supposed to do from a regulatory standpoint. Simply put,
comply or pay the consequences.
On their own, the two legs of risk and compliance make something of a fairly
wobbly stool. They are all talk and no action. They are a car with no engine.
It’s the third leg, governance, that allows the stool to stand, or the car to
drive, depending on which analogy you favor.
In this chapter, we show you the benefits of good governance, how to create
a blueprint for it, and how to make sure that you maintain a positive approach
to governance over time. We also take a look at the importance of automation
in executing your governance plan and examining the details of the SAP 
solution.
Getting to Know Governance
So, what is governance? Avoiding risk and trying to make lemonade out of
lemons seem like pretty good ideas. So, too, is complying with relevant rules
and regulations rather than paying fines, risking the company’s brand and
reputation, or worse.
However, without the governance component, compliance and risk are merely
ideas floating around the boardroom. It’s a classic stereotype: white-haired
corporate leaders sitting in the boardroom congratulating themselves

because they know what the risks to the company are and have identified
how to comply with various laws and regulations. Meanwhile, the company
falls into a giant hole of risks and is as lawless as Bonnie and Clyde with
regard to compliance because no one has taken management’s knowledge
and acted on it. The corporate execs may be aware of risk and compliance
issues, but without governance, there is no framework within which to estab-
lish a risk and compliance program.
Generally, governance is thought of as the activities and responsibilities under-
taken by the CEO and all of the other bigwigs to run and oversee the company.
Within the context of GRC, governance means doing all of the work to under-
stand risk and compliance issues and then creating policies and procedures
that act on that knowledge to ensure that risks are avoided, opportunities are
acted on in a timely manner, and compliance to internal and external laws
and regulations is actively pursued throughout the company. Governance is
also about establishing what should happen if a risk scenario occurs or some
unit of the company, intentionally or accidentally, violates internal or external
regulations. In brief, governance is the structure any company implements to
succeed in achieving its operating goals in the manner that it defines as the
right way from a risk and compliance perspective.
One way to delineate the boundaries and relationships between governance,
risk, and compliance is to think of owning a home. Compliance is the legal
side of governance, which means you have to comply with all local ordi-
nances, pay your property taxes, get approval for improvements from the
planning board, be a good neighbor, appropriately dispose of garbage and
other waste, and hold homeowners’ insurance. Risk is identifying where and
when noncompliance of the law could occur and identifying risk factors asso-
ciated with homeownership, such as maintenance issues, threat of fire, illegal
behavior on the property, loss of value due to an external action such as a
change in zoning ordinances, and failure to comply with zoning ordinances.
Governance is everything you do to achieve those goals: You have taxes auto-
matically paid from an escrow account, find good homeowners insurance, keep
the yard clean, recycle, install smoke detectors, keep a regular maintenance
schedule for repairs, and ensure everyone living in the house follows the law.
Further, a few of these governance initiatives, such as smoke detectors, an
escrow account, and a regular maintenance schedule function as controls (the
tools of governance) in that they are the means to achieve governance goals.
(For more on controls, flip to Chapter 7.)
Governance is not about creating a slow-moving internal bureaucracy. Far
from it: Governance is about creating a fast-moving, disciplined, agile, and
continuous enterprise-wide initiative centered on the areas of risk and com-
pliance. You may not be able to control government regulations or forestall
events such as the loss of a single source supplier or a natural disaster, but
governance is where the corporation and its leadership are in the driver’s
seat. Corporate leadership identifies risks and compliance issues and then
establishes the governing framework to ensure that the company manages
68
Part I: Governance, Risk, and Compliance Demystified 

risk and compliance in a way that helps drive it toward meeting its goals and
objectives, while also remaining alert to opportunities and agile enough to
act on them. The goal of governance is to break down barriers so that imple-
mentation of GRC is not done in a piecemeal fashion. GRC is not G or R or C
separately, but a unified and enduring system that is adopted throughout the
enterprise. The goal is to create a management system where all compliance
and risk structures, such as policies, processes, risk monitoring, controls, test
plans, remediation cases, and documentation are centrally managed to break
down obstacles that could hamper an integrated implementation of GRC.
Further, a strong governing framework takes into account the value of imple-
menting proactive and collaborative processes that balance opportunities
with financial, legal, and operational risks in a transparent manner.
Gleaning the Benefits 
of Good Governance
A strong governing framework has many benefits. Here are just a few:
 Increased shareholder value: A properly functioning and documented
governing framework can provide corporate leaders with an increased
sense of security as they reflect on the efforts they are making toward
managing compliance and risk issues. Governance can also provide reas-
surance to those outside of the company by demonstrating the organiza-
tion’s capacity for understanding the need to manage risk and compliance
issues as well as its ability to institute a functioning GRC system. The
result can be measured in the strengthening of the company’s brand and
reputation, which translates into stronger shareholder value.
 Lower overall costs: A unified and holistic approach to GRC also helps to
lower the overall yearly costs to managing a company’s risk and compli-
ance activities. For example, a GRC approach increases efficiency, allowing
a company to reduce the number of people dedicated to this function and
the number of hours required to carry out risk and compliance duties.
 Improved financial performance: A strong governing framework facili-
tates transparency, giving company leaders a logical and structured
process to proactively and more effectively address risk scenarios and
compliance issues. Further, by providing the tools to mitigate risk 
and manage compliance, companies can reduce performance 
variability and increase overall financial performance.
 Sustainability of efforts: Because a systematic framework is more effi-
cient and functional than a piecemeal approach, it is also far more sus-
tainable because it is less expensive from a human resources point of
view and is better able to adapt to an ever changing and increasingly
complicated business environment.
69
Chapter 3: Governance: GRC in Action

 Greater agility: In addition, as a company adapts and alters its business
model to reflect changes in the market or evolved goals, it will be better
able to evaluate how those changes will affect its risk and compliance
landscape and how individual scenarios interrelate. As a result, the com-
pany will be more adept and faster at developing processes and policies
to address these issues.
Drafting Governance Blueprints
To stick with our house metaphor from earlier in the chapter: Before you can
build the house, you need a blueprint, which may include quite a bit of cus-
tomization to meet the tastes of an individual homeowner. Governance is no
different in that it must start with a plan, but that plan will be different for
individual companies and industries due to the idiosyncratic nature of a com-
pany, its regulatory environment, and the need to create a specific area of
practice for the governance organization. 
For example, the pharmaceuticals and life sciences industries have strict
compliance requirements from the FDA; therefore, a governance structure 
for this sector would need to incorporate the rules for FDA validation.
Given that variation, here’s an overall design map to consider following as
you develop your specific blueprint:
 Create a governance office. Creating a dedicated office eliminates the
notion that governance of risk and compliance issues is some sort of
sideline job such as “Hey Ted, why don’t you organize Mary’s retirement
party, and, by the way, could you set up a governance structure for risk
and compliance?” It takes this issue and makes it part of the company’s
structure rather than allowing it to languish as an ad-hoc effort among
individual units.
The governance office is in charge of helping to populate and support the
company’s code of conduct and all risk- and compliance-related policies.
For example, the office could be in charge of investigating violations with
regard to segregation of duties policies and enforcing those policies. The
governance office is also something of a go-to point where employees and
line managers could bring questions about how to resolve issues when
two policies conflict or where a policy conflicts with a stated company
objective.
Functions of the governance office could also include fraud reporting and
prevention, diffusing and communicating policies, training on policies
and conduct, regular reporting, and coordinating compliance functions
among varying business units, to name a few.
70
Part I: Governance, Risk, and Compliance Demystified 

It is also important to note that if your company operates in more than
one country or in subdivisions with distinct sets of regulations and
rules, it would be a good idea to create a centralized governance office
with satellites localized to each geographic or relevant subdivision.
 Localize offices and policies. If your company needs to create satellite
offices for geographic areas, each of these subsidiaries should be able 
to make changes to the overall set of policies as they relate to local laws
and regulations. However, as much as possible, changes should attempt
to stay close to the central framework to maintain consistency across
the enterprise.
Localized changes and exceptions as well as all other policies and proce-
dures, should be stored in a centralized and accessible database so that
they are available to employees.
You should also sprinkle local governance officers throughout the orga-
nization where it makes logical sense to do so. The intent is to make fol-
lowing the governance framework as easy and accessible as possible.
 Ensure partner and third-party compliance. Create a structured and
standardized means to describe and communicate internal policies that
partners must follow. You must also make sure that you have a way to
verify that those partners are living up to your standards.
Be sure that as the relationship unfolds, there are documented processes
that can be used for internal and external audits.
 Communicate. Employees must feel empowered to report when violations
to policies have occurred or when they have identified previously
unknown risk scenarios. They must have access to several ways for
such communication to occur, such as a unique and standard GRC e-mail
address, phone number, or even via Web forms. The governance office
should also maintain an open-door policy for employees.
Be aware that if you allow anonymous communication, you run the risk
of false reporting. Creating the position of ombudsman, which is essen-
tially an advocate for employees making a report of a violation or incon-
sistency in a policy, helps to alleviate this worry while also helping
employees feel more secure because a dedicated officer is in charge of
representing their interests.
Creating a Framework 
for Great Governance
After you understand that you need a governance structure in place, you’re
probably starting to wonder what a strong governing framework looks like.
Simply speaking, it is a unified approach where strategy is set at the top 
and disseminated down to corporate vice presidents, line managers, and
71
Chapter 3: Governance: GRC in Action

employees (wisdom can flow downhill too). At each level, VPs, managers, 
and employees are responsible for the individual roles they are assigned in
order to implement and carry out on an ongoing basis the tactical initiatives
necessary to achieve the strategic goals. Essentially, the top-level manage-
ment creates a culture that is managed by a governance structure and cre-
ates a report card that gauges the effectiveness of the governance model.
Further, the size and scope of a corporation’s GRC efforts are determined by
the industry it is in, its relative regulatory environment, and the idiosyncratic
tendencies of its board and executive level leadership. However, some con-
ventions as to the establishment and structure of a governing framework
apply across industries and regulatory environments.
Either the board or the CEO might initiate a GRC program, but whatever the
spark, after the need for a systematic approach to GRC is identified, the CEO
generally examines governance issues with the board. Such governance issues
might include establishing a risk committee, if one does not already exist, or
to place this role under an existent committee, delineating in general terms
the risks the company should examine such as operational, compliance, trade
regulations, financial, external scenarios, and so on, and then making a rec-
ommendation for how the board (company) should proceed. One hallmark 
of companies that take governance seriously is the appointment of a Chief
Compliance Officer to own and manage the overall governance structure.
72
Part I: Governance, Risk, and Compliance Demystified 
Executives are key to the G in GRC
As discussed in Chapter 4, corporations have
had to incorporate compliance with numerous
regulations and laws since nearly the dawning
of civilization. However, Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX)
altered the landscape in a very significant way
by placing responsibility and accountability for a
company’s financial reporting squarely on the
shoulders of executives and board members.
Further, accountability includes making sure the
opportunity for a violation does not exist. As
stated in the law, executives and board members
are responsible for instituting effective internal
controls to ensure that the corporation — and by
extension, stockholders and investors — is pro-
tected from malfeasance throughout the enter-
prise. (Simply put, an employee or department
manager cannot do bad things, or if they do,
processes are in place to detect it and policies
exist to address it.)
On this last point, take the example of the store
clerk who, when handed cash at the register, is
faced with a choice — pocket the cash or place
it in the till. If there are no company rules or
processes (a tool of governance) in place, the
clerk may keep the cash and simply adjust the
register totals to avoid being caught.
In this case, the clerk is stealing, but in the con-
text of SOX, the fact that the opportunity for the
clerk to steal existed (ineffectual controls) is the
fault of executives and is something they are
liable for. By having lax governance, executives
are allowing employees to make a choice and
have the opportunity to take an action that could
hurt the company and its investors, and are
therefore liable.

73
Chapter 3: Governance: GRC in Action
Roles of the board and audit committee
With the explicit declaration in SOX that corpo-
rate leaders carry responsibility and account-
ability for the integrity of information provided to
investors and regulators, they must understand
what their role should be within a governance
framework in order to comply with the expecta-
tions created by SOX.
Board of Directors: In what has come to be
known as the Caremark case (Caremark
International Inc. Derivative Litigation; 698 A.2d
959; Del. Ch. 1996) former Delaware Supreme
Court Chief Justice E. Norman Veasey estab-
lished what is commonly termed the Caremark
Standard for Corporate Compliance programs.
Essentially, Veasey is answering the following
questions for the board of directors: What kind
of compliance program needs to be established
to fulfill the duty of oversight? And, how far must
directors go to fulfill the duty of disclosure?
Veasey then established the following seven
protocols:
 The board must truly be independent.
 The board should engage in governance,
not merely be advisors.
 Quarterly meetings on the topic of compli-
ance (GRC) should be held and directors
should expect to spend a minimum of 100
hours per year on these issues.
 There should be a regular evaluation of the
CEO and independently advised audit, nom-
inating, and compensation committees on
the board of directors.
 The board should establish and monitor
compliance programs.
 There should be a limit to the number of
boards that directors may serve on.
 The board should carefully review disclo-
sure documents to make sure that relevant
audiences and materials are made reason-
ably available.
Audit Committee: For those who draw the short
stick and are assigned to the audit committee,
the following are questions you should consider
when measuring potential risk to non-compli-
ance. These also directly relate to how this
committee should operate within a functional
governing framework.
 Are you in control of the agenda or are man-
agement and the auditors?
 Do you know the effectiveness of internal
controls?
 Do you recognize or know about off-balance
sheet financing practices or past history at
the company?
 How do you find out about third-party 
transactions?

control personnel have to evaluate ramifi-
cations on financial, technology, legal, and
operational decisions affected by internal

After the CEO examines governance issues with the board, the CFO and COO
are brought into the process. Risks (including compliance issues) have been
identified and a plan of action has been drawn up, which leads to the creation
of an implementation plan. The challenge here is expressing and implement-
ing the strategic initiatives throughout the company while also translating
those strategies into tactical actions that need to be taken at the managerial
and employee levels. The implementation plan must include how to assess
the way all levels of the company are following through on the agenda. In
other words, you have to find a way to tell people what you want them to do,
what they need to do in specific terms, and then make sure they are doing it.
To do this, the governance office should write down the policies and processes
(governing frameworks) and communicate them by dashboard, Power Point
presentations, strategy documents, or in any other manner that would work
for your company (a GRC clown, billboards, blimp, fun tattoos . . . let your
imagination run wild.) These policies and processes are then translated into
various types of plans (that is, tactics), such as management-by-objectives,
key performance indicators (KPIs), controls such as access control and
process control (see Chapters 6 and 7 for more on these), and other over-
sight and operational tools. In other words, use what works for you to get
people to do what needs to be done.
As the implementation plans are drawn up, the CEO, along with the CFO and
COO, may determine that their efforts would be strengthened by creating a
high-level officer — with a title such as Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) —
who is given the job of overseeing that the company is complying with exter-
nal regulatory requirements as well as internal policies and procedures (the
captain of a tight ship). 
CCOs are responsible for the ethical conduct of a company and are a recent
creation that has come in the wake of the passage of SOX. Additional offices
and departments can also be created depending on the needs of the individ-
ual corporation.
Depending upon the company, the CCO role could include managing policy
development; implementing and enforcing policy, which includes training,
communications and investigating policy misconduct or violations; assuring
corporate compliance with third-party (vendor or customer) guidelines and
policies, managing internal audits, facilitating external audits, and responding
to various requests from and required reporting to regulatory agencies.
Another important role played by a chief compliance officer, and one that
would translate to any company and industry seeking to strengthen its GRC
efforts, is to identify compliance violation trends.
Identifying compliance violation trends is distinct from efforts such as pre-
venting employees from downloading objectionable material from the
Internet. Rather, it involves scanning a number of resources — news media,
industry journals, regulatory Web sites, speeches by regulatory officials, and
74
Part I: Governance, Risk, and Compliance Demystified 

so on — for enforcement trends that could help the company focus its efforts
and highlight new risk scenarios. For example:
 Responsibility for partners: A few years after enactment of SOX, regula-
tory watchers were surprised to discover that the regulatory agencies
had held a few companies liable for the actions of their partners or third-
party organizations. To respond, some companies began an internal
75
Chapter 3: Governance: GRC in Action
Controls: Tools of governance
Controls are one of the more powerful tools of
governance. They encompass all of the actions,
processes or physical barriers that direct or
guide a resource or person to achieve a desired
result. Although there are many methods, they
all pretty much can be placed in the following
three categories:
Preventative controls: Preventative controls are
used to prevent an identified risk scenario from
actually occurring. For example, Segregation of
Duties (see Chapter 5 for more on that) is a pre-
ventative control because, among other things,
it seeks to ensure that no one person can estab-
lish a vendor relationship and then make a pay-
ment to that vendor. Preventative controls are
considered to be the most effective controls
because they help deter malicious behavior or
avoid risks and alert management in a timely
fashion.
Detective controls: Detective controls are used
to determine if any bad behavior or risk scenario
has occurred or is occurring. They are also
used to validate that monitored processes —
such as payments to vendors, financial report-
ing, or regulatory compliance — are being per-
formed within certain tolerances. For example,
within SAP’s GRC solutions, tolerances for
financial reporting can be set so that if one unit
is reporting a drop or increase in net sales that
exceeds set tolerances (“why are we selling so
many shorts in January?”), which could indicate
a reporting issue (“Actually, one division has
transferred a bunch of shorts to another division
and someone is labeling those as sales”) and/or
a business issue (“We may not be producing
enough shorts to meet demand”), a report is
created and appropriate personnel are notified
in order to set the response plan into action
(“We need to label the transfer appropriately
and increase shorts production”). These con-
trols are important because they provide infor-
mation to help a company understand where it
is within the risk and compliance spectrum and
what actions, if any, should be taken at any
given time.
Corrective controls: Corrective controls are
policies and procedures that lay out what
actions are to be undertaken if a risk scenario
occurs (“Why did Bob set up a vendor relation-
ship with a company named Bobcom and then
approve a check to be sent to a private resi-
dence?”). These provide the methods neces-
sary to correct whatever condition may exist
(“We need to talk with Bob”). Within the SoD
example, if an individual is found with conflict-
ing roles — establish a vendor and then make
a payment (“Bob?”) — that person’s roles are
redefined to remove the exception (“Bob, we
still need to talk”). 
If a net sales tolerance is exceeded and a report
is generated, actions such as an internal audit
of that particular unit could be undertaken to
understand why the tolerance may have been
exceeded, and justify and document it (i.e.,
more people are buying shorts in January
because more people are going on vacation to
Florida at that time).

analysis of how they interact with their partners and third-party organi-
zations and for any scenarios that could possibly place them at risk of
being held accountable for the actions of others. In this way, the efforts
to seek out trends helped these companies enact preventative controls
to address the new risk scenarios they had discovered.
 Conversations between partners: Another compliance violation trend
to consider is scrutiny of the collaboration between two partner compa-
nies. It is not hard to imagine that conversations that unintentionally
veer into the area of unit costs could be interpreted as attempts at price
fixing. To react to this kind of risk, a company could enact an initiative 
to examine how conversations between partners are carried out and to
establish a system of procedures to ensure regulatory compliance.
Evaluating Your Governance Framework
After a governing structure is in place, you must still evaluate whether it is
performing well and ensure that it is capable of achieving the company’s
goals. These two questions could prove helpful in assessing the strength 
of a governance framework:
 What is the structure of the risk management process from a strategic
and operational perspective?
 What’s the structure of the legal and regulatory compliance department?
From a strategic and operational 
perspective
When evaluating the structure of the risk management process from a strate-
gic and operational perspective, what you’re hoping to find is that the risk
management process is relatively sophisticated and somewhat self-managed
so that it could be relied upon for data that is accurate and thorough in its
nature and scope. The bottom line is that strategic and operational risks are
vital bits of data for a company to know, so therefore the company should
allow the experts to run and develop that data with little or no interference
(in other words, keep micromanagement to a minimum).
For example, in the case of a large software implementation deal, risk man-
agement would and should have the expertise to make sure the salespeople
are not over-committing the company to something it cannot deliver on, or
that the implementation may in some way as yet unseen cause the company
to lose money, displease the client by not meeting the deliverables, cause a
legal risk (such as a compliance infraction), garner negative publicity, or
some combination of the above.
76
Part I: Governance, Risk, and Compliance Demystified 

So, if you feel that your risk management efforts follow the model outlined in
Chapter 2, it is likely that risks are being identified and that the company is
able to develop a plan to mitigate those risks, which is the essence of good
governance — managing risk and compliance within the company’s business
environment.
From a legal and regulatory 
compliance perspective
The second question to answer when evaluating your governance framework
is, “What are the tasks that the legal and regulatory compliance department
should perform?” The tasks for this group fall into the areas of setting, com-
municating, and enforcing policies. More specifically, the group tasked with
compliance should do the following:
 Identify legal and regulatory risks
 Evaluate policies from the standpoint of completeness, especially
regarding whether they are complete (or whether a new policy is
needed)
 Evaluate policies from the standpoint of enforcement. Are the policies
being enforced the way they should be? 
 Evaluate policies from the standpoint of effectiveness. Are the policies
achieving their stated goals? Are they effective?
 Decide on and implement a strategy for communicating policies and 
governance initiatives
 Assess where and whether training is necessary and if so who should
receive training and how often (for example, new hires receive training
and company wide refreshers are held quarterly on various topics)
 Make sure that staff is available to answer questions about policies and
that everyone knows how and where to report policy violations if 
necessary
 Decide how to respond to any violations of policies
 Establish a performance metric so that it can demonstrate what the
group has done and communicate the value of its work to the company
In all, the evolution and ongoing efforts toward a strong governance regime
are part of an iterative process that involves as much intuition and learning
through experience as it does an application of long established business
practices.
77
Chapter 3: Governance: GRC in Action

Perhaps, though, the best way to test for the effectiveness of the company’s
governance efforts is if every employee at any level of the organization knows
what the company expects of them, they know what the policies are, they
know where to find them, and have been trained on those relative to their
function. (Sounds like the perfect employee, doesn’t it?)
Hurdles to Instituting and Maintaining 
a Good Framework
With any project that is worth doing, there are going to be a number of chal-
lenges and hurdles to overcome at implementation and throughout the life of
the initiative. Establishing and maintaining a good governance framework is
no different because there are a number of ways for a company to go astray.
In the next few sections, we give a few examples of issues to be considered.
78
Part I: Governance, Risk, and Compliance Demystified 
The Open Compliance and Ethics Group
For those seeking a good resource to help them
get started on the journey toward GRC or for
those seeking to better hone their efforts, the
Open Compliance and Ethics Group (OCEG) pro-
vides quite a bit of information at its Web site
www.oceg.org. The OCEG is a nonprofit organi-
zation dedicated to helping companies align
their GRC efforts in order to drive business per-
formance and promote integrity.
To this end, the online magazine Compliance
Week published a series of articles by Scott L.
Mitchell, chairman and CEO of the OCEG . These
articles are intended to help companies put the
goals of GRC into practice. (The series can be
found online at www.complianceweek.
com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Page.
viewPage&pageId=345.) Throughout the
11 part series, a number of best practices are
highlighted that relate directly to the gover-
nance function of GRC (many of these overlap
with the information provided above).
Here is a summary of a few of Mitchell’s points:
 Corporate culture is a safety net for the
company facilitating information sharing
 Talented individuals should drive the gover-
nance initiative and should occupy decision
making roles
 The governing framework ensures that
objectives (strategic, operational, financial,
and compliance) can be achieved; prob-
lems being detected in a timely manner;
when detected the response is timely and
effective; and the framework complies with
internal and external regulations
 Information should be able to easily reach
relevant external stakeholders
 Technology should be used appropriately 
 Process and nomenclature should be ubiq-
uitous among the company’s units and
reflect industry norms
 Valid tests and metrics should be in place to
validate the framework is functioning as
intended and detect issues

Avoiding GRC silos
For most companies, compliance issues and risk analysis have been done on
something of a case-by-case basis. For example, a new regulation is enacted,
causing the company to respond by assigning its legal team to establish what
the company’s responsibilities are in order to comply. A plan of action on
that one issue is then created and implemented.
As time goes by, the company, wittingly or unwittingly, creates a variety of
piecemeal structures to address individual risk and compliance issues rather
than creating a unified and efficient enterprise-wide approach. In this way,
the company has established numerous GRC-related silos under a plethora 
of issue areas. Such efforts are inefficient, carry a higher degree of risk, lack
visibility, and miss out on opportunities that could be created using a more
holistic approach.
As Scott Mitchell writes in the first segment of his series for Compliance
Week, “How Do We Align Our GRC Initiatives?” many organizations operate
between three and 15 GRC silos divided among various business segments,
such as financial, human resources, billing, and so on. He notes that with the
above issues of a segmented GRC approach, these companies also place a
significantly greater compliance burden on their core business functions.
These companies may recognize the need to make investments to manage
compliance and risk, but because they have established a segmented rather
than unified governing structure, they are mismanaging their investments.
Making GRC strategic
As the previous example demonstrates, many companies have perceived GRC
(though they may not have thought of compliance and risk management in
terms of GRC) to be an adjunct project rather than an ongoing and iterative
process integrated into the company’s operations.
In the years following the passage of SOX, many companies considered com-
pliance and risk to be tactical issues rather than a unified strategic initiative,
which, in many cases, led to over-reliance on third-party contractors (primar-
ily audit firms operating outside of their regular audit functions) to carry out
the controls necessary to comply with the new regulations (and, by extension,
assess risks in this area). In this manner, auditing firms were able to grow rev-
enues from non-audit clients by providing controls, doing all of the testing of
those controls, and then telling the client what controls they should have in
order to comply with the requirements of SOX.
Not only is this expensive (auditors were more than happy to bring in teams
to perform these functions and then reap significant fees for these services),
but the knowledge of how to establish a compliance system and create the
79
Chapter 3: Governance: GRC in Action

governance framework around it was left with the auditors — the company
likely retained very little of this “how to” knowledge. It was the equivalent 
of receiving a fish someone else caught rather than learning how to catch it
yourself.
The solution is for companies to start perceiving GRC as more than just
addressing separate issue areas and perceive it as a strategic initiative rather
than a set of tactics to be applied on a piecemeal basis. As such, a company
should integrate this knowledge and function into its day-to-day operations
rather than having an outside firm carry out the process for them. A company
could hire an auditing firm to consult on what controls are needed, how to test
them, and help document the process. At that point, however, the process
should be brought in-house. Third parties can still be helpful to periodically
evaluate how well the GRC initiative is being carried out, however, and to sug-
gest improvements.
Justifying the cost of GRC
The fact that cutting costs equals increased profits, all other things being
equal, is a very simple formula for people to understand. You can easily see
that executives and managers face huge pressures to make sure that costs are
as low as they can be. In many ways, cost control is their number one impera-
tive. Within the context of GRC, though, top-down pressures could push some
managers and executives to cut GRC-related investments to the point that the
company’s exposure to risk and compliance violations is increased.
For example, think back to the homeowner’s analogy we mentioned earlier in
this chapter. When a person buys a house, they have it inspected to ensure
that the roof doesn’t leak, the electric system is up to code and safe, the exte-
rior walls are painted and there are no signs of rot, the septic system is in good
working order as is the rest of the plumbing, and that the foundation is solid.
However, as time goes by, a certain amount of wear and tear occurs on the
house. Without continued investments to replace the roof before it leaks,
update the electric system, maintain the plumbing, and fix cracks in the foun-
dation, there is a risk of failure with profound consequences to the house and
the people living in it. Further, a lack of investment may cause the home to
violate certain municipal codes or ordinances. And of course, the batteries 
in the smoke detectors need to be regularly checked and replaced.
GRC for a company is no different: It has to be an ongoing investment. There-
fore, it is important to incorporate within the governing framework a means
to rationalize and communicate the need (risks and benefits) to maintaining
investments in GRC in an enterprise-wide and sustained manner.
One solution to this issue, writes Scott Mitchell, is to develop a thorough and
logically argued business case for GRC investment that can be easily accessed
80
Part I: Governance, Risk, and Compliance Demystified 

and communicated to all levels to assure enterprise-wide understanding of the
importance of maintaining the GRC home and what that entails.
The challenge, though, is that many of the benefits to GRC and a strong gov-
erning framework are difficult to quantify because they either prevent a risk
scenario from occurring or are difficult to measure and report. One example
of a factor that’s difficult to report is the fact that if employees are better at
their jobs, the brand and reputation of the company are more highly regarded,
better decisions are being made at all levels, and so on. Further, some in lead-
ership may not view GRC as a high priority worthy of continued investment.
As Mitchell writes, “An effective business case will communicate GRC’s strate-
gic value by showing key components of the GRC program support or enable
overall strategy.” An effective business case should also quantify the problems
and issues that are being avoided by showing the costs of non-compliance,
costs of minimally complying (that is, inefficiencies caused by silos, duplica-
tion of efforts, errors, visibility, etc.), and miscellaneous risks such as unethi-
cal behavior by a single or small group of actors within the company. It should
then explain the benefits of GRC, and explain the journey to GRC.
Applying GRC too narrowly
It may be obvious that the framework and tools of governance should be
applied to resolve SoD issues and to ensure SOX compliance, among others,
applying the framework and tools (controls) across all activities of the com-
pany, even in areas that may at first glance seem to be outside of the scope 
of GRC is also important.
For example, charitable contributions may seem like a relatively benign area.
However, suppose that a company contributes a certain amount to a number
of charities in a year and payments on that commitment are made in three
installments.
A company with lax oversight (lack of controls or too narrowly applied) on
how those payments are made is establishing the opportunity for a number
of risks to occur, such as employee fraud and/or noncompliance with tax
laws and financial reporting requirements. If a payment isn’t made because
an employee managed to divert it or a mistake occurs, and the company
claims it as a deduction, that contribution, rather than serving the greater
good, could create a significant financial risk and sully the company’s reputa-
tion and brand.
Within a broad and strong governance framework, these payments would be
established within the system in the same manner as a vendor contract. Con-
trols would be in place to prevent or identify an issue and report it to the
appropriate person, and a process to react and mitigate the impact of 
the event would exist.
81
Chapter 3: Governance: GRC in Action

Setting up checks and balances
Within any governing structure, a robust set of checks and balances must be
in place to ensure that the system is operating as intended and to make sure
that there is little chance a risk or compliance issue could be missed.
At a company that perceives its risk management and compliance efforts as a
strategic initiative designed to drive company performance and integrates a
broad and strong governance framework, controls would be in place to docu-
ment and send an alert if income from operations deviates from set tolerances.
And policies and processes would be in place to address the alert limiting the
company’s risk exposure and liability.
Further, and importantly, within this type of framework, systems would be in
place to check the checkers. A good governance framework addresses the
question of what happens if the manager who receives the alert does not act
on it.
Governance includes creating a strong and responsive corporate culture that
can overcome the social, financial, and career pressures to act irresponsibly
that may be experienced by any individual. Essentially, it is policy with some
controls to establish culture and enforce behavior.
Just as checks should be placed on individuals within the system, there
should be checks on the system as a whole as well. This is where a mix of
technology and external oversight can be used to enhance internal oversight.
In the case of Enron, they did have limited external oversight in the form of
Arthur Anderson, but this proved to be dysfunctional in terms of providing
the type of oversight the company needed to avoid the risk scenario that
played out. A proper governance framework includes some degree of external
oversight that is qualitative and has the independence to be effective, ask dif-
ficult questions, and hold the company accountable to its own GRC goals.
Making the Argument for Automation
Within a governing framework, tactical software has an important role to play.
After all, when considering the complexity and scope of a company’s activi-
ties that would fall under the domain of GRC, and in particular governance, it
is easy to see that manual processes and self-reporting by employees would
fall short. For this reason, automation of critical functions is key to achieving
the goals of efficiency, transparency, uniformity, data collection, reporting,
and documentation, to name a few.
For example, would a manual process detect if ten payments to one vendor
for $10,000 each are entered into the system, yet are totaled out at less than
82
Part I: Governance, Risk, and Compliance Demystified 

$100,000? Or would a manual process be able to generate an automatic report
if an important disbursement step is being manipulated or accidentally
missed?
The answer to these questions is a profound maybe.
As companies see the need for a unified and holistic GRC strategy, they are
also seeing the need to weave technology into the mix at every level of the
organization. And they are looking for products that not only match their
business model, but also the compliance and risk scenarios for their respec-
tive industries. They want IT solutions that can decidedly answer the preced-
ing questions in the affirmative and do so in a manner that reflects the
environment they operate in.
Therefore, they are looking for IT solutions that facilitate a unified corporate
strategy, incorporate the three control classifications (see the sidebar
“Controls: Tools of governance” elsewhere in this chapter), aid in discovering
new opportunities where GRC can align with the overall business goals of the
organization, and reduce the potential for loss or mitigate scenarios as they
may occur across the enterprise. Further, the benefits derived from this
approach would extend to partners, suppliers, and customers in a truly 
systemic approach.
Just as you should avoid implementing a governance framework in a piece-
meal fashion, the same is true for GRC IT applications. Fragmented or seg-
mented automation efforts only confound the overall goal of a unified and
systemic governing structure.
The SAP Approach: Integrated 
Holistic IT for GRC
As one example of an integrated IT approach, SAP provides a suite of inte-
grated solutions that are intended to support a holistic approach to GRC by
automating end-to-end GRC processes, which includes corporate governance
and oversight, risk management, and compliance management.
The primary motivations behind SAP’s unified platform approach flow directly
from established GRC goals, which, in a general sense, are to effectively govern
GRC activities from a system-wide and integrated perspective. Embedded in
the platform architecture is the intention to treat GRC as being one piece of the
company’s core business processes so that it can be integrated within the day-
to-day activities of the company.
The applications within the suite are each targeted towards a particular
aspect of GRC with one each for governance (SAP GRC Repository, shown in
Figure 3-1), risk (SAP GRC Risk Management), and a number targeted toward 
83
Chapter 3: Governance: GRC in Action

compliance (SAP GRC Access Control; SAP GRC Process Control; SAP GRC
Global Trade Services; and SAP applications for environment, health, and
safety compliance management).
Further, harkening back to the beginning of this chapter, as governance seeks
to break down barriers between risk and compliance activities, each of the
SAP GRC applications is designed to support the overall goals of the company’s
governance framework. For example, SAP GRC Risk Management provides
support for best practices such as collaborative risk analysis, predefined risk
responses, and continuous monitoring and reporting. The SAP GRC Global
Trade Services application embeds regulatory and corporate compliance into
core logistical processes. And the applications for environment, health, and
safety align business processes with environmental, occupational safety, 
and product safety regulations as well as internal policies to make manage-
ment of all three sharper and more efficient.
From a governance perspective, these applications feed into the SAP GRC
Repository — the central IT tool for governance — in order to centralize
management in terms of documentation, testing, remediation, and control
monitoring. As such, the SAP GRC Repository centrally documents and stores
all governance, risk, and compliance information for enterprise-wide and
industry specific needs, and provides the means to centrally manage compli-
ance structures, policies, processes, risk and control libraries, test plans,
remediation cases and evidence.
In addition, the application links risks and controls to multiple external 
security and control modalities — such as the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations and Control Objectives for Information and Related
Technologies — as well as to financial reporting requirements and health,
and safety regulations.

In short, the intent is to desegregate disparate GRC structures in order to
reduce system complexity and ensure the company is maximizing its return
on investment (ROI) for its GRC efforts.
Coming to Grips with Governance
It’s easy to view GRC as something of a burden because, on its surface, it
appears to come with costs and seems to be placing constraints on the core
functions of the company. This is especially true of the governance part of it
because this is where you actually have to go and talk to people and change
what they are doing, and as we all know, change is hard.
However, if you look past the surface, you will find that GRC is only a con-
straint to those activities and potential actions that could cause the company
harm. And governance is the mechanism by which a company frees itself of
risk and takes on its regulatory responsibilities — in other words, does its
chores — in the best way possible.
So it is even easier to accept what may at first glance seem to be a contrarian
point of view, which is that an integrated and holistic governing framework —
and GRC system in general — can liberate corporate resources by automat-
ing its risk and compliance management and placing related functions within
a highly efficient and cost effective system. And on top of that, governance
initiatives can play a significant role in helping a company find and create
opportunities to enhance core functions.
Far from being a burden, governance can be, and often is, an agent for change
and for systematically helping an organization achieve its goals.

Diving into GRC

In this part . . .
You plumb the depths of everyone’s favorite GRC 
regulation, Sarbanes-Oxley, and then take a step back
to examine how fraud can happen and the segregation 
of duties that can prevent it. You’ll then jump into the
important areas of controls: access control, making sure
that roles don’t conﬂict in ways that promotes violations,
and process control, whereby you put in controls to
watch over key business processes, making them efﬁcient,
compliant, and easy to monitor. Taking all this in, you 
then look at one of the most complex areas of compliance:
global trade, where hundreds of regulations govern
imports and exports and acronyms abound.

S
arbanes-Oxley, otherwise known as SOX, is a law passed in 2002 that is
changing the way companies and their senior executives behave. Some
say it is the most important securities law since the 1930s, when legislation
was enacted after the Depression and the subsequent banking crisis. SOX
was passed in response to the corporate and financial scandals of the
early 2000s, when companies such as Enron and WorldCom covered up
or misrepresented a variety of questionable transactions, resulting in a
crisis in investor confidence and huge losses to their shareholders. The
US government responded quickly, passing the Sarbanes Oxley Act, which
holds up a mirror to the way corporations do business. Spawned from scan-
dal, SOX is an attempt to find the moral compass that businesses lost in the
2000s.
In 2000, 2001, and 2002, the stock market finished lower than the year before
for three years in a row: a feat that hadn’t occurred since the 1930s. When
you consider the snowballing effect of company scandals, the loss of billions
of investor dollars, and a huge decline in investor trust, it was clear that
something needed to happen. The Public Company Accounting Reform and
Investor Protection Act of 2002, or SOX, is that something. In this chapter, we
look at the events that led to the creation of SOX and the ramifications the
law has for your business.

Figuring Out Whether SOX
Applies to You
SOX applies to you if you are:
 A publicly traded company, a division of a publicly traded company, or a

 By law, you are not allowed to punish whistle-blowers. (In other words,
don’t shoot the messenger.)

Discovering Why SOX Became Necessary
In the late 1990s, a stock market bubble was created: More and more compa-
nies were going public, and the share prices of listed companies kept going up.
Some companies forgot to serve their shareholders and instead focused on the
numbers. They were more interested in making analysts happy than making
their shareholders happy. In addition, extreme competition for experienced
executives pushed company leadership to offer shares as part of their compen-
sation, which meant there was more of a drive to keep the prices going up.
Enron, for example, threw any bad deals into off-the-books partnerships to hide
their bad assets, and their accounting practices no longer represented the real-
ity of their finances. Then there were conflicts of interest for companies such
as Arthur Andersen, which provided consulting services and audit services to
Enron at the same time. Still, as the gatekeepers, Arthur Andersen should have
drawn attention to the corporate fraud that was taking place (in fact, however,
Arthur Andersen went out of business partly because its employees gave the
order to shred documents at Enron.) When it became public knowledge that
companies were indulging in willful fraud and corruption, there was a decline
of public trust in accounting and financial reporting. People were losing billions
of their investment dollars. In 2000, 2001, and 2002, the stock market ended
every year down compared to the previous year. The US government needed to
make investors confident in the market again, and so SOX was born.
Have corporate scandals such as those seen at Enron happened before? In
his book The Complete Guide to Sarbanes-Oxley (Adams Media), UCLA law
professor Stephen M. Bainbridge says that they have, many times:
“History teaches us that market bubbles are fertile ground for fraud. Cheats
abounded during the Dutch tulip-bulb mania of the 1630s. The South Sea
Company, which was at the center of the English stock market bubble in the
early 1700s, was a pyramid scheme. Fraud was rampant before the Great
Crash of 1929. Hence, it was hardly a shock to find fraudsters and cheats
when we started turning over the rocks in the rubble left behind when the
stock market bubble burst in 2000.”
After the 1929 stock market crash and the resulting Great Depression, Congress
passed several statutes to regulate the securities markets. In 1933, it passed
the Securities Act, which legislated against fraud in the sale of securities, and
allowed issuers to sell any securities, even unsound ones, provided they gave
buyers enough information to make an informed investment decision.
The content of these 80-year-old laws requires companies and auditors to
maintain strict financial controls. However, because this was clearly not hap-
pening, it became necessary for the US government to re-release the laws.
They did just that in 1992, reinstating the older laws.
91
Chapter 4: How Sarbanes and Oxley Changed Our Lives

Being SOX-compliant means that companies are allowing investors to make
informed decisions with clean, up-to-date, and management-certified informa-
tion. Misinformation, whether intentional or not, is now punishable by law.
This insistence on clean information levels the playing field for investors and
shareholders. Instead of operating in the dark, they can now see the light.
Who Are Sarbanes and Oxley, Anyway?
The Sarbanes in Sarbanes-Oxley, is Paul Sarbanes, a lawyer and Democratic
senator who represented Maryland in the Senate from 1977–2007. Elected to
the House of Representatives in 1970, Sarbanes sat on the House Watergate
Committee in 1974 to introduce the first Articles of Impeachment for obstruc-
tion of justice against President Richard Nixon. In 2002, he was the Senate
sponsor of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Michael G. Oxley was a Republican
member of the House of Representatives for Ohio, from 1981–2007. In 2002,
he was chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, giving him pri-
mary responsibility for Sarbanes-Oxley on the House side.

The scandals: How bad were they?
The names Enron and WorldCom have become
synonymous with scandal, and for good reason:
The scope of their misdeeds is staggering. The
Enron debacle is estimated to have wiped out
some $60 billion in shareholder value, whereas
WorldCom lost roughly $175 billion worth of
investors’ money. WorldCom’s $103 billion bank-
ruptcy filing in 2002 was the largest in U.S. his-
tory; Enron’s $63 million filing in 2001 was the
second largest.
In the wake of the scandal, Enron laid off nearly
all of its 22,000 employees, and WorldCom cut
its staff by 5,100 before heading into bankruptcy.
Many of those employees lost pensions, retire-
ment savings, and college tuition funds.
And because many pension funds around the
country had invested in Enron and WorldCom, the
ripples from the scandals spread far and wide.
For example, the Florida’s state pension fund lost
$335 million when Enron went bankrupt. The
Oklahoma Teachers Retirement System lost $17
million before selling its holdings in WorldCom.
The scandals also set off a wave of investiga-
tions into the accounting practices of other cor-
porations including Tyco, Qwest, and Coca Cola.
The scandal even had political ramifications.
Many questioned the Bush administration’s
close ties to Enron officials; California residents
recalled their governor, Gray Davis, and elected
Arnold Schwarzenegger in part because of the
state’s power crisis, a crisis in which Enron
played a role.
Historian Joel S. Seligman told The Washington
Post that Enron “was the most important cor-
porate scandal of our lifetimes. It was one of the
immediate causes of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
the governance reforms of the New York Stock
Exchange and NASD, and the most consequen-
tial reorientation of corporate behavior in living
memory.”

Sarbanes and Oxley, whose pictures appear in Figure 4-2, both retired from
public life in 2007.
Breaking Down SOX to the Basics
SOX aims to restore investor confidence and enhance corporate governance
by using a series of internal checks and balances. The goal is to ensure trans-
parent financial reporting. SOX consists of 11 titles and 65 sections. Instead of
quoting you the full letter of the law, we have selected a specific group of
important sections related to compliance to give you an overview.
Sections 302 and 906: Threatening
management with a big stick
SOX seeks to prevent the kinds of failures of leadership that happened at com-
panies such as Enron, and much of the law is aimed at corporate managers and

Alphabet soup: Your handy guide 
to SOX terminology
Here are some of the many acronyms you’ll
hear tossed around when discussing SOX, and
what they stand for:
 COBIT: Control Objectives for Information
and Related Technology
 COSO: Committee of Sponsoring Organiza-
tions of the Treadway Commission
 FASB: Financial Accounting Standards
Board
 GAAP: Generally accepted accounting
principles
 IFRS: International Financial Reporting
Standards
 ITIL: Information Technology Infrastructure
Library
 PCAOB: Public Company Accounting Over-
sight Board
 SEC: Securities and Exchange Commission

directors. Section 302 places responsibility for the content of the financial
reports firmly at the feet of the CEO and CFO by requiring that they certify
them. Certification is nothing new, but with SOX, the conditions of certification
have become much more rigorous. There is zero tolerance for misinformation.

SOX: A Layperson’s Translation 
We want to help you understand the most impor-
tant things about SOX. This means we try to put
something very technical — law — into plain
English. There are professionals who both make
the law clearer and sometimes make it more
complicated: Those people are called lawyers.
Just keep in mind that we make no guarantees
about our explanations here; go talk to a lawyer
if you want that kind of help. Also, we can rec-
ommend another book for more information:
SOX For Dummies (Wiley Publishing), by Jill
Gilbert Welytok, who is a lawyer.
302: The CEO and CFO are directly responsible
for the accuracy, documentation, and submis-
sion of all financial reports, as well as the inter-
nal control structure to the SEC.
(Translation: The CEO and CFO are on the hook
for making sure the company’s financial reports
sent to the US Securities and Exchange Com-
mission are right. We talk more about Section
302 in a bit.)
401: Financial statements must be accurate,
without any incorrect information, and include
all off-balance sheet liabilities, obligations, or
requirements. 
(Translation: It is no longer possible for compa-
nies to hide any information that might affect
their share price if it became common knowl-
edge. They must present their true face to the
world, warts and all.)
404: All annual financial reports must contain an
Internal Control Report, stating that manage-
ment is responsible for an “adequate” internal
control structure. Management should provide
an assessment of the internal control structure,
and report any shortcomings. 
(Section 404 is another biggie; we’ll explain this
one in detail later.)
406: Companies must disclose whether they have
adopted a code of ethics for their top financial
managers and if not, why not. The code must
establish standards and provide for avoiding
conflicts of interest. It must mandate personal
and corporate compliance with SOX regulations.
(Translation: A code of ethics will guide finan-
cial managers on how to behave should they be
tempted to stray from the path.)
409: Companies are required to disclose on an
almost real-time basis information concerning
material changes in its financial condition or
operations.
(Translation: If there are big changes to the
company’s financial condition or its operations,
the company has to tell the SEC.)
802: Imposes fines and/or sentences of up to
20 years imprisonment for altering or destroy-
ing records with the aim to disrupt a legal
investigation.
(Translation: Destroying documents is bad.)
906: Requires that each periodic report filed with
the SEC is certified by the CEO and CFO and that
it complies fully with the statute and presents
fairly the financial condition of the company.
(Translation: So that CEOs and CFOs can never
again say, “I didn’t know.”)

Section 302 requires that when filing either an annual or quarterly report,
both the CEO and the CFO must certify that they have
 Reviewed the report
 Found that the report does not contain any material untrue statements,
any material omission, and is not misleading
 Found that the financial statements and related information present the
financial condition and financial results fairly and accurately
In addition, the CEO and CFO must acknowledge that they
 Are responsible for internal controls, have reviewed these controls in
the last 90 days, and have reported on these findings
 Have provided a list of all deficiencies in the internal controls and infor-
mation on any fraud that involves employees who are involved with
internal activities
 Have noted any significant changes in internal controls or related factors
that could have a negative impact on the internal controls
This set of acknowledgements is changing the way CEOs and CFOs work.
They are forced to actively monitor and assess controls to ensure that
no fraud can take place. Senior management now has to spend time and
money finding out precisely, and in detail, how their controls are working.
They can no longer — as many of the Enron management team did — plead
ignorance.
SOX considers this new level of commitment from executives in certifying
what they know so essential that it appears twice in the legislation: once in
Section 302 and again in Section 906. This is what is becoming known as the
“Belt and Suspenders Theory” (the name comes from the fact that some
people, just to be sure their pants won’t fall down, wear both a belt and
suspenders). 
In Section 906, the big stick appears. Here lie the criminal penalties for failure
to comply: a $1 million fine or a 10-year sentence for executives who claim
ignorance of misinformation, and $5 million fine or a 20-year sentence for
executives who willfully provide misinformation. Some stick, huh? (However,
the jail sentences will only be used in extreme cases, where executives are
shown to have willfully misrepresented the facts. For errors in their compli-
ance framework, senior staff members are more likely to face fines and penal-
ties.) Figure 4-3 shows a timeline of convictions under SOX during the
regulation’s first year. 
95
Chapter 4: How Sarbanes and Oxley Changed Our Lives

Section 404: Ensuring a healthy
immune system
The rules set out in Section 404 can be compared to the guidelines for a
healthy lifestyle: Having a healthy immune system, for example, is not just a
case of luck. We have to make good choices: eat lots of fruit and vegetables
rather than junk food, drink lots of water, and take vitamins. Buying fresh pro-
duce and vitamins can be expensive, but we decide that being healthy is
worth the extra expense. Lots of healthy individuals make a more healthy
society. Section 404 is fresh food and vitamins for a company: It may cost you
to implement the internal controls, but they ensure that your business runs
wholesomely and that bugs like fraud are flushed out before they make the
company sick. Lots of clean, healthy companies make for a clean and healthy
investment culture.
The content of Section 404 is succinct, weighing in as it does at 168 words:
“(a) Rules Required. The Commission shall prescribe rules requiring each
annual report required by section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 to contain an internal control report, which shall
(1) state the responsibility of management for establishing and maintain-
ing an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial
reporting; and
(2) contain an assessment, as of the end of the most recent fiscal year of
the issuer, of the effectiveness of the internal control structure and proce-
dures of the issuer for financial reporting.

(b) Internal Control Evaluation and Reporting. With respect to the inter-
nal control assessment required by subsection (a), each registered public
accounting firm that prepares or issues the audit report for the issuer
shall attest to, and report on, the assessment made by the management
of the issuer. An attestation made under this subsection shall be made in
accordance with standards for attestation engagements issued or
adopted by the Board. Any such attestation shall not be the subject of a
separate engagement.”
What does Section 404 mean for business?
Section 404 requires that companies build up an internal control system that
is checked by the CEO and CFO, and then by an external auditor. The control
system should guarantee that the closing accounts are correct and should
also have built-in checks to prevent fraud. A company’s internal access con-
trols and process controls must be able to spot inconsistencies. Many com-
panies are choosing to automate their processes to help them monitor for
fraud. The human element is, unfortunately, not a guarantee of consistently
clean information.
Although Section 404 can be summed up in a few words, it is no lightweight.
According to University of Austin, Texas business law professor Robert A.
Prentice, in his forthcoming article, “Sarbanes-Oxley: The Evidence Regarding
the Impact of Section 404,” in the Cardoza Law Review, “whether SOX will ulti-
mately be considered a success or not depends on the legacy of 404.” Section
404 also has the loudest detractors and supporters. For more information,
see the “The cases for and against Section 404” sidebar in this chapter.
97
Chapter 4: How Sarbanes and Oxley Changed Our Lives
The cases for and against Section 404
Supporters of 404 believe that to avoid fraud and
improve investor confidence, companies must
have good internal controls and independent
audits. The reports produce clean information
for the capital markets. Companies with poor
internal controls tend to have more risk. The
benefits of 404 — better gatekeeping, clean
information, less risk — far outweigh the nega-
tives. Since the implementation of SOX in 2002,
no major domestic corporate scandals (except
for backdated ones) have occurred. In other
words, 404 and its SOX counterparts are doing
the job they were meant to do.
Detractors believe the costs of 404 outweigh the
benefits. Direct costs of 404 implementation
have far exceeded expectations. A major factor
has been the increased audit fees. These costs
are especially burdensome for small compa-
nies. Companies are either choosing to list on
the London and Frankfurt Stock Exchanges
instead of in New York to avoid the regulations,
or they are choosing to go private. Foreign firms
are choosing not to go public in the U.S. All this
is damaging New York’s image as financial cap-
ital of the world. Detractors also say the law,
with its emphasis on penalization, is too tough.

Information Technology: SOX in a Box
In any company, the Information Technology (IT) group — the computer
geeks — plays a vital role in helping companies become compliant. When
processes are defined, automated, monitored, and corrected, maintaining
internal control and ensuring clean information is much easier. IT drives the
financial reporting processes by managing data, documents, and key opera-
tional processes. Therefore, the role of the Chief Information Officer (CIO),
who is responsible for the security, accuracy, and reliability of the systems
that manage and report the financial data, now plays a vital role in the certifi-
cation and compliance process. Far from being a dead-end job, the CIO is now
a powerful political role in a company.

Part II: Diving into GRC 
COSO’s Five Main Elements of Internal Control
Control environment: The foundation for all
other elements, influencing the control con-
sciousness of the people within the organization
and encompassing every aspect of how the
organization is structured and works.
(Translation: This is the big picture. If your control
environment is healthy and is already functioning
well, then sowing the seeds of compliance will be
straightforward. If your control environment is
sick and needs help, you are probably looking at
a big change management project.)
Risk assessment: The identification and analy-
sis of risks to the achievement of the organiza-
tion’s business objectives.
(Translation: In order to know your business, you
need to know your risks and know them well.)
Control activities: The policies and procedures
that help the board and management ensure
that their control decisions are carried out in
relation to identified risks.
(Translation: You’ve identified your risks, your
control environment is good, and now you need
to set up the policies and procedures that will
help senior executives make their decisions.)
Information and communication: This must occur
at two levels: first, the board must communicate
its control objectives to all employees; and
second, the IT system must capture and report
pertinent information in a time frame and format
that enables the organization’s board and man-
agement to carry out its responsibilities.
(Translation: Both the head and the body need
to be working together. If the messages don’t
get to the brain, the body will die.)
Monitoring: The ongoing monitoring of internal
control systems includes regular and ad hoc
functional and management reviews. It should
be based on risk assessment, with serious defi-
ciencies being reported to the board.
(Translation: Procedures are not always perfect.
They can have weaknesses or break down. You
need to monitor them to ensure that you know
when they are failing you. You are the master of
your processes; they are there to serve you and
not the other way around.) 

As SOX regulations have enhanced the role of IT within a company, they have
also created a boom in IT projects and solutions. Niche companies are provid-
ing SOX solutions, while large software vendors are also providing software to
automate internal controls as part of a larger GRC project. SOX has created an
internal controls industry that is run by an army of vendors and consultants.
IT frameworks: Your template 
for compliance
The SEC has mandated U.S. companies to use a recognized internal control
framework. There are a number of these, including COBIT (Control Objectives
for Information and Related Technology) and ITIL (Information Technology
Infrastructure Library). Some companies may choose one framework to
structure their controls, whereas others may cherry-pick sections from
each, although that could be more time-consuming and lead to gaps. Sound
like more rules? Maybe, but the IT frameworks are really skeletons on which
companies flesh out their own unique set of business processes.
COBIT builds on the financial compliance framework provided by COSO. COBIT
is widely recommended by analysts, auditors, and consultants. It is published
by the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA) and the IT
Governance Institute, which notes that the work that goes into meeting SOX
requirements should not only be regarded as compliance but also as an oppor-
tunity to build strong governance models. ITIL is a best practice library devel-
oped in the U.K. from work done for Office of Government Commerce. 
COSO’s control framework
COSO was originally formed in 1985 as part of a private sector initiative by
the National Commission on Fraudulent Financial Reporting. Since 2002,
COSO has been extended and renamed. The COSO Enterprise Risk
Framework emphasizes the importance of identifying and managing risks
across the enterprise.
COSO defines internal control as “a process, effected by an entity’s board of
directors, management, and other personnel, designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the achievement of objectives in the following categories: 
 Effectiveness and efficiency of operations
 Reliability of financial reporting
 Compliance with applicable laws and regulations”
99
Chapter 4: How Sarbanes and Oxley Changed Our Lives

The SOX ripple effect
Implementing any of these frameworks has a huge impact on the IT and
Finance functions within a company. Companies implementing COSO, COBIT,
or ITIL should not underestimate the training and change management impli-
cations. People in Finance will have new processes to monitor, repair, and
report on; IT employees will require new design and procedural skills; HR
departments will have to hire or train people to make these shifts. Being SOX-
compliant is not something only CEOs, CFOs, CIOs, board members, or audi-
tors have to worry about. It changes the way everyone in a company works.
Paying Up: What’s SOX
Going to Cost You?
For most organizations, the first year of SOX compliance was not easy. It was
costly and time consuming. Companies had to redesign and document their
roles and processes. Usually managed as a project, SOX compliance caused
significant disruption to business activities. Guidance from the authorities
was limited, and the auditors themselves were often unsure of what was
required. Because little SOX-compliant software was available, most initial
projects were mainly manual or spreadsheet based and painstakingly slow.
The basic goal of most companies was to get through the audit without mate-
rial weaknesses, whatever the cost. Not surprisingly, costs were significant.
SOX Costs Then
KPMG, a global firm specializing in audit, tax, and advisory services, con-
ducted a survey of 90 Fortune 1000 companies covering their first year com-
pliance with SOX, which revealed that:
 Twelve percent of companies disclosed material weaknesses in their
internal controls over financial reporting. 
 On average, companies spent around $1 on SOX compliance for every
$1000 of revenue. 
 On average, companies remedied 271 control deficiencies in SOX during
the first year. They still had another 77 deficiencies left to address at the
end of that year. 
 Two-thirds of the companies disclosing a material weakness in their
internal controls over financial reporting changed their CFOs within
three months of filing their SEC returns.
100
Part II: Diving into GRC 

SOX Costs Now
In the early years, SOX cost. Now, SOX still costs, but a study commissioned
by Financial Executives International (FEI) shows that the SOX-related costs
are coming down. FEI surveyed 172 companies with a market capitalization
above $75 million and found that in 2006, SOX-related costs came down 23
percent. Employee hours spent on compliance came down 10% from 2005 to
2006, while external hours (by auditors) decreased 14 percent. The survey
also found that:
 Compliance costs were cheaper for companies with centralized opera-
tions than for those with decentralized.
 Twenty-two percent of respondents feel the benefits of compliance out-
weigh the costs (up from 15 percent in 2005).
 Sixty percent agree that compliance has improved investor confidence.
 Forty-six percent say financial reports are more accurate, while 48 percent
say financial reports are more reliable.
 Thirty-four percent agree that compliance has helped prevent or detect
fraud.
Chances are good that complying with SOX is going to cost you a lot, but not
as much as it would have cost you if you were becoming SOX-compliant in
2003. The range of software vendors offering products to help you automate
your internal controls has grown exponentially since then. Independent audi-
tors have had a few years to absorb what they have to do. The SEC has clari-
fied its requirements. A few years ago, the experts were all fumbling around
in the dark, but they have seen the light. Their clarity will help you become
SOX-compliant faster, better, and cheaper than your predecessors on the
stock market in the prehistoric days of 2002.
Setting the Record Straight
Up to 5 percent of companies on the U.S. Stock Exchange have restated their
financials since SOX. Auditors’ thresholds for materiality are much lower,
even when just looking at the numbers. If there are errors in previous years,
or big mistakes such as the backdating of stock options, you will have to
restate your previous financials. By facing the mistakes, you are saying to
investors, “We did wrong, but we are willing to admit it and fix it.” 
101
Chapter 4: How Sarbanes and Oxley Changed Our Lives

Other Laws You Need to Know About
In 1988, prior to SOX, the U.S. government also reinforced the 1977 Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act requirements, which define how you report your inter-
national trade to the government and outlaws bribery. According to the law,
corrupt payments to foreign officials to obtain or keep business are illegal.
Since 1988, the law also pertains to foreign firms or employees who act in the
U.S. in furtherance of any illegal payments.
We’re All In This Together: Convergence
SOX requires that US-listed companies have a system of internal controls and
that directors monitor and report on operational risk. All companies must
follow the U.S.-specific generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
Similar standards are emerging elsewhere, and the spread of the International
Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) outside the US means that a convergence
is taking place in financial reporting and requirements. Figure 4-4 shows you a
map of SOX-like laws around the world.
Japan’s J-SOX
In 2006, the Japanese Financial Instruments and Exchange Law was promul-
gated and it comes into being in 2008. This law has become affectionately
known as J-SOX. Also inspired by corporate scandals, J-SOX requires that
companies implement a management assessment of internal controls on
financial reports. Like SOX, J-SOX is relevant to listed companies and their
subsidiaries. It is expected that J-SOX will prompt mass audit automation, as
it has in the U.S.

Australia’s CLERP-9
The Corporate Law Economic Reform Program (CLERP) Law of 2004 aims to
strengthen Australia’s financial reporting framework. The details of CLERP
are less prescriptive than SOX: They contain reforms to the existing corpo-
rate governance provisions, including changes to financial reporting and
executive remuneration. Provisions are in place to ensure auditor and analyst
independence.
Canada’s C-11
Brought into law in 2005, C-11 has established a procedure for the disclosure
of wrongdoings in the public sector and ensures protection for the person
who discloses these. (Protecting the whistleblower is also a big part of SOX.)
Basel II
Basel II has created an international standard for banking that regulators can
use when making regulations on how much capital banks must have to offset
potential risk. The more risk a bank has, the more capital it should have in
place to ensure that it stays solvent. This requirement proactively provides a
big safety net should things go horribly wrong.
Sorting Out the Benefits of SOX
SOX is no longer in its infancy. The law has begun to mature and reveal its
promise. According to the article “The Unexpected Benefits of Sarbanes-
Oxley” by Stephen Wagner and Lee Dittmar, published in the Harvard
Business Review, publicly held companies who have been through the SOX
mill and come out the other end intact are seeing unexpected benefits. Some
of these include
 A better control environment, where executives set the tone for ethical
behavior and employees follow suit 
 Facing the mountain of documentation required by SOX means making
improvements to procedures and employees’ understanding of these
procedures
 The Audit Committee takes its role seriously
103
Chapter 4: How Sarbanes and Oxley Changed Our Lives

 Functions converge, processes become streamlined and standardized
 The reduction of needless complexity
 Strengthening weak links
 Reduction of human error by automating processes
SOX is not aimed at private companies. However, those that do choose to
implement the SOX requirements will discover that this creates competitive
advantage, as PriceWaterhouseCoopers stated in its 2006 white paper,
“Finding the Silver Lining: How Private Companies Can Benefit from the New
Governance and Disclosure Standards.” SOX is the new gold standard for
business management processes, and private companies may find that they
ignore it at their peril, particularly if they are competing with listed compa-
nies for contracts. SOX rules will decrease the risks associated with consum-
mating the deal for pre-IPO companies. For companies with sophisticated,
widely distributed shareholders, the existence of well-documented internal
controls and governance policies will attract investment capital at lower cost.
And for closely held companies, a reliable control environment will help
owners to protect and preserve their wealth.

disclose changes to their material information, and refrain from shredding
documents. Regulations also mean companies have to stay clean, and this
process is called governance.
This chapter addresses how things got messy in the first place. We look at
what the errors are — intentional or otherwise — that companies make on
a day-to-day basis that open them up to fraud and bad governance.
In the U.S., the SEC prosecutes three levels of culpability: negligence, gross neg-
ligence, and fraud. In this chapter, we address these, as well as another quality
that makes for financial unkemptness: entropy. Entropy means that things fall
apart, not intentionally, but through bad management and bad systems.
The good news is that SOX’s rigorous financial reporting requirements have
led to fewer prosecutions for fraud and negligence. Research from Deloitte
shows that the number of fraud actions has fallen since 2003, when SOX
became law. Companies are getting clean and staying clean.

Defining Fraud
Fraud is a deliberate misrepresentation of events that causes another person
to suffer damages, usually monetary ones. Fraud — or the opportunity to be
fraudulent — is all around us. We are faced with the opportunity to commit
fraud every day. We can walk out of grocery stores with items we haven’t
paid for, either by accident or on purpose. How we respond to a situation —
either returning or concealing the items — depends on our situation,
integrity, and character.
In companies, through lack of compliance and bad governance, employees are
presented with opportunities for fraud all the time. The onus is on manage-
ment to ensure that these opportunities are as rare as possible. Management
must be proactive about fraud, removing the conditions from the workplace
where fraud can occur.

Preventing the abuse of power
by segregating duties
In the U.S. government, the well-known doctrine
of separation of powers ensures that the execu-
tive, legislative, and judicial branches don’t have
undue control over their respective branches of
government. In the world of business, this con-
cept is called segregation of duties (SoD). The
concept of segregation of duties has been in
place in the business world for quite some time,
but it is now being more fully implemented in the
U.S. and around the world, due to laws like
Sarbanes-Oxley and J-SOX. 
Segregation of duties involves dividing up job
functions so that the likelihood of fraud is
greatly diminished and putting controls in place
to ensure that key processes can be monitored.
SoD helps ensure that no one party has too
much power, much like in government, and that
when two or more parties collude to commit
fraud, it is detected before it is too late. Without
such oversight, a single party or group could
commit fraud, leading to damage of the institu-
tion and its shareholders, as was the case in the
Barings Bank scandal (see the “The Barings
Bank scandal — Operations risk extraordi-
naire” section for more information).
Segregating duties follows a pattern. This pat-
tern helps keep key employees of a business in
check. It starts with identifying a function that
must be performed — a function that the com-
pany cannot afford to eliminate. This function,
in order to be carried out, involves a power that
could potentially be abused. 
The functions to examine in this way generally
fall within four categories of duties or responsi-
bilities: authorization, custody, record keeping,
and reconciliation. In a perfectly segregated
system, different employees would perform each
of these four major functions. One person should
not control two or more of these responsibilities.
Sometimes, a branch office is too small to assign
these functions to different people and one
person must take on more than one of these
functions: In this case, a manager is assigned to
oversee all of that person’s transactions. This is
an example of a mitigating control.

U.S. law states that fraud requires specific intent — you have to know that
you are intentionally violating a law or regulation. That’s why lying about
your weight is not fraudulent, but lying about the capability of a product in
order to entice someone to buy it is.
Motivations for fraud
One motivation for fraud is pretty obvious: garden-variety greed. However,
there are others. When people are in a desperate situation — needing to pay
for healthcare for their aging parents, for example — they might deliberately
act in a fraudulent way at work to get the needed funds. This doesn’t mean
that they are greedy or bad, but that they are desperate and that the lack of
controls in the work environment has created an opportunity for them to
commit fraud.
The second situation is Cover Your, um, Assets (CYA) Syndrome. Someone
makes mistakes at work, takes risks she shouldn’t take, and then doesn’t
want to get caught, so she cooks the books and covers her trail. The basic
motivation in this case is fear.
Sowing the seeds of fraud
Just like certain weather conditions promote hurricanes, certain corporate
practices create just the right conditions for fraud to occur, including
 Complexity: Allowing the proliferation of unique roles. Roles are meant to
simplify access control (and management) by standardizing the system
access given to people in certain kinds of jobs. But pretty soon, Susan in
accounts payable needs special privileges for year-end and Ralph in pro-
curement needs some other permission and all the orderliness is gone.
These “special” privileges are never revoked, opening the door for segre-
gation of duties violation and — you guessed it — fraud
 Letting users do too much: Concentrating power in one employee so
that an employee can commit fraud by, for example, creating a phony
vendor and cutting a check to them
 Unrealistic expectations: Encouraging employees to meet unrealistic
goals, especially when teamed with financial compensation that inadver-
tently places pressure on people to achieve these goals in any way
possible
 Lack of oversight: Providing opportunities for employees to test the
waters for fraud, resulting in weaknesses that go unnoticed by others
107
Chapter 5: Fraud, Negligence, and Entropy

 Shooting the messenger: Demeaning or penalizing people who bring
risks to management’s attention
 Brushing it off: Rationalizing or trivializing bad behavior so that
employees continue to exploit the situation and managers do not con-
front suspicious behavior
Some common examples of fraud
One type of fraud involves employees, who may be unaware of controls in
place to prevent fraud, testing the waters to see if they can get away with
something. For example, say a retail clerk discovers that customers pay for
their catalog merchandise at the customer service desk. The clerk then finds
a customer’s order, gives it to him, receives the payment, and places it in the
cash drawer. Payment comes in the form of check, credit card, or cash. The
customer signs a receipt of merchandise and that record goes in the drawer
with the payment copy. But the clerk is having difficulty making ends meet,
so one day she decides to keep the cash and destroy the merchandise receipt
for a $20 transaction. The clerk waits to see if there are any questions about
the missing money. When no one questions her, she does it again; the next
time, removing payment for two transactions. When the control (which
matches the receipts to a shipment manifest) is eventually performed, it
reveals missing merchandise. The controls that were invisible to the clerk
gave her an opportunity to test the waters.
Another type of fraud involves savvy employees who know exactly how the
controls work and can manipulate them to their own advantage. For example,
a payables clerk who is responsible for managing payments knows that pay-
ments that don’t reach the vendor are almost always questioned, and vendor
reconciliations between payables and payments are done periodically.
However, the payables clerk knows that reconciliations are sometimes four or
five months behind. Every year, the company makes a charitable contribution
in three installments. The amount is significant during good years and is usu-
ally reduced in bad years. The clerk changes the vendor name and address
for one payment cycle to divert a payment to himself and, immediately after
the payment cycle, reverts the name back to the charity. The charity never
complains about not receiving the third installment because they assume the
company has reduced its contribution because of a bad year. In this case,
there was no segregation of duty between vendor changes and payments.
This oversight allowed the clerk to divert the payment by using his own
authorized capabilities for unauthorized purposes. The vendor reconciliation
ignored the insignificant amount, among the millions in payments, and the
clerk was able to pay his aging parents’ healthcare bills: It’s another case of
desperation meeting bad controls.
108
Part II: Diving into GRC 

Another type of fraud involves outright theft of goods from the company. Say
that in the procurement process, an order is created and approved, goods or
services are received, and then invoiced payments are made. A secretary
places orders for stationery supplies and receives them, taking a large share
of them home. She starts out with pens and then moves on to printer car-
tridges, creating an eBay store for printer supplies to supplement her salary.
In this case, Segregation of Duties (SoD) would have prevented this problem
by requiring that one person create the order, another person receive the
goods or services, and a third person pay the invoices.
The Barings Bank scandal: Operations
risk extraordinaire
Some dishonest people, of course, do a lot more damage than a clerk pocket-
ing cash or a secretary filching office supplies. An extreme example of fraud
is the Barings Bank case, where rogue trader Nick Leeson defrauded Barings
Bank and its customers of billions of dollars, causing the bank to collapse.
This was a case of CYA syndrome: Leeson made mistakes and had to employ
a spiral of distraction techniques to cover his, er, tracks.
On Thursday, February 23, 1995, Nick Leeson, assistant director and general
manager of Barings Futures Singapore (BFS), a branch of Barings Bank of
England, left Singapore with his wife and flew to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The
next day, Leeson faxed his resignation to Barings, citing health reasons.
Taken as just a simple account of the activities of an ordinary person over
the course of two days many years ago, this would seem to have no real sig-
nificance. But Nick Leeson was no ordinary person. He was a rogue trader,
and his activities in the few years just prior to 1995 caused the collapse of
Barings Bank, a dramatic event that reverberated for years in the halls of
banking worldwide.
In 1989, Leeson began his Barings employment with the settlements depart-
ment of Barings Securities Limited, the trading division of Barings Bank. He
was just 22 years old. Soon after arriving, he was sent to Hong Kong and
Jakarta to sort out problems with Barings operations in both cities, and he
was successful in doing so. These successes placed Leeson in a position of
favor with his bosses, and in a few years’ time, he was rewarded for his efforts.
In April 1992, Leeson was sent to Singapore to head the settlements and
accounting departments of the newly formed Barings Futures (Singapore)
Ltd. (BFS). This new position also included leading BFS’s Singapore
International Monetary Exchange (SIMEX) floor operation.
109
Chapter 5: Fraud, Negligence, and Entropy

Both of these jobs effectively placed Leeson in the position of being in charge
of both the front- and back-office workings of BFS. Because of this and also
due to the complicated nature of Barings’ regular management structural
changes, it was unclear who Leeson was supposed to report to. In effect, he
had no day-to-day boss, apart from supervision that he was supposed to
receive from Barings in London.
Soon after arriving in Singapore, Leeson took the SIMEX traders’ exam, which
he passed. But he didn’t tell SIMEX that he had been turned away by the
Securities and Futures Authority in the UK when he applied to take the
traders’ exam there, due to his failure to report a judgment against him for
a personal debt. Barings knew about Leeson’s problem in the UK, but they
too failed to inform SIMEX.
What followed was fairly complicated. Leeson set up a false BFS account
and began making gambles in the SIMEX futures market (using monies from
subsidiaries’ accounts that were not supposed to be used) and racked up
considerable losses. But instead of reporting those losses as losses, Leeson
reported them as gains. This went on and eventually came to a head just after
the Kobe earthquake in Japan, which caused the Japanese markets to tumble.
Leeson had bet on a rapid recovery for the Nikkei, but this recovery didn’t
materialize. After it was over, Leeson’s losses amounted to $1.4 billion, twice
the amount of Barings’ trading book.
The day Leeson and his wife fled Singapore, his superiors had arrived at the
BFS offices and discovered the false account, but it was too late. The Bank of
England attempted a bailout of Barings, but did not succeed. Barings was a
230-year-old institution, the personal bank to Her Majesty the Queen. About a
week after Barings’ collapse, the Dutch group ING purchased Barings for £1.
Here are some of the lessons that can be learned from the Barings Bank
scandal:
 Watch for warning signs. Leeson’s disqualification for the UK trader’s
exam should have raised an alert.
 Don’t play favorites. Barings was impressed with Leeson’s successes
and thus didn’t alert SIMEX that Leeson had been disqualified from
taking the UK trader’s exam. 
 Always segregate major responsibilities. This case was a segregation of
duties violation deluxe: Leeson was in charge of both back- and front-
office operations. Not only could he create bogus accounts, but he could
also move money into them and in turn report the losses as profits, all
with no oversight.
 Lack of supervision. Management oversight is key. Leeson had no real
supervision; it was unclear who his boss was. Given today’s virtual
workforce, this lesson cannot be overemphasized.

Negligence: More Likely Than Fraud
U.S. law defines negligence as acting with deliberate disregard of the conse-
quences of the act. It defines gross negligence as acting with knowledge of
the fact and with deliberate disregard of the consequences of the act. The
difference between gross negligence and fraud is that fraud is considered as
acting with intent. Fraud is so difficult to prove that the term is rarely
invoked. Negligence is far easier to prove — and fits in quite well with human
nature’s tendency to drop the ball.
Lack of compliance with regulations such as SOX usually results in charges of
negligence or gross negligence, which leads to fines. Therefore, a company
may receive a SOX-related fine if management doesn’t give a good reason why
they haven’t adopted a code of ethics, forgets to disclose material changes of
information, or is slapdash about financial reporting and internal controls.
The classic example of segregation of duties failure is when an employee can
set up a vendor and make a payment to a vendor. This scenario provides the
employee with the opportunity to set up a fictitious vendor and pay himself.
An auditor combing through a company’s transactions will see this as a red
alert.
Failure to segregate duties is known as setting the fox to guard the henhouse,
because it provides employees with opportunities for fraud. Because fraud is
hard to prosecute, SoD failures are more likely to lead to fines for negligence,
gross or otherwise. 
To mitigate the potential for charges of negligence, a company should segre-
gate the duties, allowing one person to set up the vendor and another to pay
the vendor. If, for practical reasons, the company can’t segregate the duties,
it needs to put in compensating controls, such as having a manager check all
the transactions that the person who does too much enters into the account-
ing system.
Entropy: Errors, Omissions,
and Inefficiencies
Entropy is the tendency for things in general to naturally fall into disorder.
Think of the proliferation of papers on the top of your desk during a busy week.
The same thing can happen in corporate accounting systems. The disorder is
unintentional and it can happen because of bad management, inefficiency, and
just plain not taking the time to rigorously follow an organizational system. No
111
Chapter 5: Fraud, Negligence, and Entropy

fraud or gross negligence occurs, but a company makes errors and omissions.
This kind of lack of control is very expensive to companies in terms of loss of
revenue, and it is often only recognized after it is too late.
When people work in large teams, assuming that someone else took care of
a particular task can lead to work being neglected. Or, tasks might be done
twice, because one worker doesn’t realize that another worker already took
care of a particular job. In this way, the work environment becomes ineffi-
cient, but no one recognizes it until it is too late.
As companies grow and start to become unwieldy, they also lose control of
their system permissions. Some examples are
 Roles: A role contains a set of permissions in the system for an individ-
ual to complete their job in the organization. Roles need to be analyzed
to ensure they don’t contain any internal segregation of duty conflicts.
For example, a role may contain the ability to set up a vendor and make
a payment. And to make it worse, this role could be assigned to many
people across a company, thereby increasing exponentially the chance
of fraud.
 Users: Users are assigned roles to complete their assigned responsibili-
ties. In most organizations, the assignment requires an approval to make
sure that the roles are appropriate. However, many times, roles are not
removed from individuals when they are transferred or take on addi-
tional responsibilities. An individual can acquire dangerous combina-
tions of capabilities as additional roles are added and others are not
taken away.
 Superusers and temporary users: Superusers are those people who have
exceptional knowledge of the system and are given broad access. All
organizations have these key individuals and an implied trust is given
to these people that this broad access is only used when necessary.
However, having too many superusers with access that is far broader
than necessary can lead to trouble. Temporary users gain their privi-
leges for special occasions, such as year end closing. In a pinch, it’s easy
to grant temporary users those privileges and forget to revoke them,
turning temporary users into overly privileged characters.
Cleaning Up: The Mop-Up Operation
If you’ve taken a good hard look at your company, you may see that things
aren’t as clean and efficient as they could be. You want to get compliant and
clean. How do you go about it? Since SOX was passed, companies and their
senior management have had to learn to think like auditors.
112
Part II: Diving into GRC 

Thinking like an auditor
SOX requires public companies to document every tiny step of each of their
processes from beginning to end. The auditor’s job is to follow each process
(such as order to cash, for example) and ask the following questions:
 Who’s involved throughout the process?
 What kind of access do they have? What other accesses do they have?
 Who has approved what?
This exercise is extremely time- and resource-intensive, especially when you
consider that companies often have different systems (running their Human
Resources on SAP and their Procurement on Oracle, for example), and within
the various systems there are hundreds of different roles. The auditor is
expected to understand both the business side and the IT side, and then pull
all this data together to run reports. This monumental task is why auditors
get paid so much. They are highly paid detectives, sniffing out SoD violations
and the potential for fraud and negligence.
Making the computer your auditor
Managing all these interdependencies is like three-dimensional chess, and
even massive spreadsheets with teams of analysts can’t reveal all the possi-
ble combinations that could lead to problems, let alone monitor them in real
time. The only way to handle all this kind of complexity is to automate it,
making technology into a virtual auditor. Chapters 6 and 7 tell you how.

Role of Roles
In This Chapter

 Discovering the SAP approach to access control
I
n Chapter 5, we discuss how fraud can occur where duties are not clearly
segregated. To minimize fraud, companies need to wisely segregate the
duties of employees. And to segregate duties, companies rely on roles and
access control.
The concepts behind these terms are simple. Everyone in the company should
have a well-defined role that minimizes the opportunity for fraud. And when an
employee needs to access a computer system, access controls need to be in
place that allow the employee to access only what he needs to do to perform
his job: nothing more, nothing less. In this chapter, we look at these concepts
in-depth. We also discuss how roles can wind up being much more complicated
and difficult to manage than you might expect. We also take a look at the SAP
solutions for access control.
Understanding Access Control and Roles
Employees perform their duties once they are logged into the system, but it’s
also vital to monitor how they get there. Most companies have thousands of
users. Each user has one or more role. Each role has access to a certain
number of transactions in the system. Many companies have more than one
system to which users have access. Each of these systems have hundreds of
screens, with multiple transactions. All this adds up to a massive number of
places where segregation of duties violations can occur — hundreds of thou-
sands, in fact. 

Access control is a gatekeeper function that patrols system access, ensuring
that these myriad holes, these places where violations can take place, remain
safely plugged. It’s rather like the Immigration Department of a company’s
system: providing specific visas for specific stays in the country. Immigration
carefully monitors who does what, separating the short-term holiday-makers
from those who plan to do business in a country. Immigration checks pass-
ports, issues visas for those who need them and visa waivers for those who
don’t and occasionally, refuses entry to someone who they believe may pose
a threat. In this way, they ensure that people enter the country for the right
reasons and have the applicable amount of time in which to have their holi-
day or do their job. By cautiously giving the right people, the right kind of
access, they ensure that no violations occur. So it is with access control.
Of course, employees aren’t actually tourists or business travelers, and happily
the vast majority are trustworthy. But good governance — and auditability —
means that we need to carefully segregate duties. By not properly segregating
duties, companies create opportunities for fraud as well as human error, each
of which leads to revenue loss. This is why companies require a method to
tighten up and organize access to financial systems. But before we take a look
at where we stand today, let’s take a look back and see how we got here.
Getting a Handle on Access Control
Access control refers to what a person can do in a computer system or appli-
cation after she has signed on. The sign-on process is referred to as authenti-
cation — proving to the system that you are who you say you are. The most
common form of authentication is password authentication. For the purposes
of this chapter, we assume that authentication is already taken care of. To
sign on, you might have had to do a fingerprint scan, a retinal scan, or simply
type the password that is on a sticky note on your monitor (we hope not!).
Now that you’ve signed on, what can you do? In this chapter, we talk about
the access you and others have to applications, especially financial applica-
tions, after you have signed in or, in other words, after you have successfully
authenticated yourself.
These days, we think of access control in terms of access to computer sys-
tems. But it wasn’t always this way. Access once meant primarily physical
access to buildings and rooms in buildings. You might have seen racks of
keys on a wall (or a picture of such a key rack). Typically one person was in
charge of all the keys and managed them from one office. If you needed
access to a room you didn’t have a key to, you would walk into the room
where that key rack was, talk to the person behind the desk, sign out a key,
116
Part II: Diving into GRC 

and promise to bring it back. This was definitely primitive, but there was a
record of who had what access and to where. And if a key was missing from
that rack, the person in charge would come looking for it. Very few people
had all the keys; for example, a janitor would have a jangling bunch of keys,
with access to virtually every room because he or she had to clean them all
or at least empty the trash every day. (The plot line of many films includes a
scene of someone posing as a janitor to get to some secret information.)
Today companies have to control not only access to buildings, but also to
computer systems. Both have become more sophisticated over time; rooms
and buildings now have keyless entry and other fancy electronic entry sys-
tems. Access control to computers has also gone through some evolution.
Users and permissions
Way back in the mists of time, system administrators would give permissions
to various users. Users would get a username and password and then would
be given access to various applications. (Not all computer platforms allowed
for this, though. PCs were meant to belong to a single person, so the whole
concept of access control had to be added on later.)
The equation went like this: 1000 users equals 1000 sets of permissions.
That’s a lot of unique sets of permissions to keep changing or revoking as
people changed jobs or took on additional responsibilities.
117
Chapter 6: Access Control and the Role of Roles
Your essential access control glossary
Lots of lingo gets thrown around in discussions
about access control. Here are some of the
terms you’ll hear most often:
 User: An individual employee’s technical
access to the system
 Superuser: An individual with technical
access to all system features and all
transactions
 Role: Access to specific functions by virtue
of the employee’s job title or responsibilities.
Possible roles include salesperson, accounts
payable clerk, and purchasing agent.
 Access Control: A means to control who
does what in the system
 Transaction: A field or set of fields used to
perform an action in the system (for exam-
ple, Set Up Vendor Account)
 Event: An action performed by a user (for
example, logging on, opening an application)

The roles revolution
As the number of users increased, it became harder for system administrators
to manage their associated permissions. One day, someone had a bright idea.
What if we give salespeople access to the system based on their job and not
on their user name? It would be easier to manage access based on a limited
number of roles instead of based on the number of users. Role-based access
control was a major step forward, organizing and streamlining access to com-
puter systems.
The equation changed. A thousand users have 50 jobs; 50 roles with associ-
ated permissions.
That looks pretty good, right? Much more manageable and auditable. And if a
user changes jobs — or takes over someone else’s duties — they could be
assigned more than one role, but we still only need 50 roles.
How Access Control Got Messy
In theory, roles looked like a huge step forward, anyway. But like many good
ideas, maintenance is tricky. And today, at many companies, there are once
again almost as many roles as there are users. 
How did access control get messy again? There are at least five contributing
factors:
 Every user is different
 Virtual things are hard to track
 IT and business don’t speak the same language
 Exceptional circumstances dictate exceptional access
 Large scale increases complexity
In the next few sections, we look at each of these factors in more detail.
Every user is different
Going from 1000 users to 50 roles sounded pretty good. But then, as life would
have it, one salesperson needed a little more access than another one. And one
accounts payable clerk needed slightly different access from another. Over
time, the number of roles escalates to close to 900 roles for 1000 users, and a
lot of those roles are similar, but not exactly the same. Now in walks the auditor,
and the job of seeing whether duties are properly segregated just got a whole
118
Part II: Diving into GRC 

lot harder. If an auditor has 50 roles to check, that’s pretty simple, though each
one might be complex. But when almost every user has a unique role, checking
900 roles for segregation of duties violations is going to take a long time.
Virtual things are hard to track
Imagine you are sitting at your desk when suddenly, all the files and folders
on your hard drive physically manifest in your workspace.
Okay, you can start breathing again; that can’t happen. The fact is that virtual
things are hard to keep track of. And so it is with access control. 
The visual image of the keys on the rack made it easy to see when one was
missing. The keeper of the keys would quickly find you if you had one out
longer than you said you would.
Roles get messy in part because access is virtual. When someone needs
access (a key, in this analogy) to get something temporarily (say someone’s
sick and they need access to their transactions), IT typically forgets to ask for
the “key” back again; that is, to revoke the access. And when their colleague
is back at work, the individual who got the exceptional access doesn’t go
back and ask to have it revoked.
Worse, sometimes (under pressure) IT hands out a “master key” so they
don’t have to keep track of five different keys late on Friday afternoon before
the holiday weekend, but once again, they forget to ask for the keys back.
Handing out a master key lets you open all the doors, or, on a computer
system, access all the transactions. Such access must be carefully controlled. 
Seeing a mess is difficult when that mess is on a hard drive or when it’s a
computer abstraction, such as roles. That’s why unless a disciplined
approach has been taken to controlling access, the mess is probably bigger
than you know.
IT and business don’t speak 
the same language
Sometimes, two groups simply don’t speak the same language. Historically,
access control has always been the preserve of the IT department, with no
input from the business side. The IT department looks at access control from
the perspective of technical roles, with application, transaction, screen, or
field-level access. Businesspeople tend to think about job roles and would
simply ask IT to set up access for a marketing manager, which seems very
clear to the business person but offers no guidance about application, trans-
action, screen, and field access. This communication gap must be bridged.
119
Chapter 6: Access Control and the Role of Roles

When IT attempts to communicate problems to business, the same type
of communication problem ensues. For example, if IT decides to check for
segregation of duties violations and runs a report or a query, it may find a
violation within the procurement department and notify them. However,
procurement doesn’t understand the report because it’s too technical and
not in their language. They hand it back to IT, telling them to fix it. Unless
reports are written in language that business understands (we have made
a payment to a vendor who shouldn’t be paid, a duplicate check is going to
go out), they won’t take responsibility for access control problems.
Exceptional circumstances dictate
exceptional access
IT departments do try to keep access control managed. However, at certain
times, IT departments may be pressured by users. At year end, when people
need to close the books, they want to run reports and get data into the system.
Perhaps Mr. E, who has access to these transactions, has had to make an emer-
gency visit to the doctor. His colleagues call IT and demand access to his trans-
actions. Or perhaps someone in the payroll department is on vacation, and HR
needs to run paychecks. Under pressure, IT hands out access. The problem
arises when IT forgets to revoke the access, or when the users forget to remind
IT to do so. In this way, you see users with roles that become more and more
nonstandard over time, a kind of insidious accumulation of access, sort of like
putting on weight over the holidays.
Large scale increases complexity
Small companies can get away with users having unique roles. When compa-
nies grow and develop a huge pool of roles, which they have created them-
selves or inherited through mergers and acquisitions, access becomes a
nightmare to manage. Add to the mix multiple instances of different brands
of software, and you find that managing users with unique roles becomes
impossible. There are hundreds of roles. No one knows exactly what they all
mean; they probably conflict with each other, and there are likely to be SoD
violations within the roles themselves. This scenario leaves the company
open to fraud.
If any or all of these situations prevail at your company, it’s time to repair
your access control. Poor access control is not only a security risk, but it’s a
mess for auditors to try and figure out, and you don’t want unhappy auditors.

Getting Clean
So proliferation of roles, implementation of numerous software systems, and
the passage of time have all contributed to a very complicated access control
picture. Complexity is the enemy of security and good governance. So, how
can you reduce this complexity? 
Figuring out where you stand
Analysis is the first step toward righting the ship. Analysis entails bringing IT
and businesspeople to the table and analyzing the roles that exist and their
associated SoD violations. For example, duties are not properly segregated if
a user can both
 Set up a vendor and make a payment
 Change an order and complete a goods receipt
 Change a receipt and make adjustments to inventory
Automating role analysis is a good idea if you have the tools to do so. This
automation does not replace the meeting of the minds between IT and busi-
ness, but can simplify the process and make it easier to untangle the mess.
121
Chapter 6: Access Control and the Role of Roles
Ten SoD violations you may not have thought of
Most people know that you shouldn’t allow the
same person to set up a vendor and cut a
check. But some SoD violations are a little less
obvious. Here are 10 more segregation of duties
violations to get the wheels turning as you ana-
lyze your roles:
 Depositing cash and reconciling bank
statements
 Approving time cards and distributing
paychecks
 Preparing an order and changing a billing
document 
 Changing an order and creating a delivery
 Creating a journal entry and opening a
closed accounting period
 Creating general ledger accounts and post-
ing journal entries
 Maintaining accounts receivable master
data and posting receipts
 Maintaining bank account information and
posting payments
 Maintaining assets and creating a goods
receipt
 Completing goods transfer and adjusting
physical inventory counts

We once heard an anecdote of an access control consultant who would visit
a company and talk to its IT department about roles. He would ask them to
provide six roles that they thought were good and six roles that they thought
were bad. After running a scan with an automated tool, he invariably found
that almost all the “good” roles were bad, too. Consider the impact of these
bad roles: If one role has three SoD violations, and 3,000 users have that role,
that bad role creates 9,000 conflicts.
The sheer number of potential violations that most companies have shocks
them into reality. Where they once believed they didn’t have a problem, they
now know it is time to be tactical, to fix their controls, and clean up their roles.
Starting the conversation
The first step is one of the hardest. You need to bring IT and businesspeople
to the table together, along with internal auditors.
If the roles that exist are causing SoD violations, somewhere a breakdown of
communications is occurring among these stakeholders.
Examining the org chart
Some of the problems may stem from the jobs themselves. Are employees
given conflicting duties? Cleaning up their roles in the system won’t change
the problem if what is needed is a fundamental reorganization that segregates
duties effectively among employees.
Defining auditable roles
Who owns and defines the roles? It’s highly possible that businesspeople
think this is the province of IT. But the people who define the jobs should
define the roles that reflect those jobs. Therefore, ownership should belong
to the business process owners. By taking responsibility for this area, line-of-
business managers accept that good role management is part of their every-
day business.
Mapping the business roles to technical roles
Here is where the IT department comes into play. Business roles need to be
mapped to technical roles.
Business process owners can define which permissions make up a role,
document role status, and keep change histories. They can redesign roles
and analyze what would happen if a role changes. (For example, how many
people would still be able to do their jobs, and would new SoD violations
be created?). Business process owners can develop new roles. This kind
of control consciousness will take the discomfort out of company audits.
Companies learn to be proud of their good, clean roles.
122
Part II: Diving into GRC 

If you think that it sounds like line of business managers should take the lead
here, you’re correct. They need consultation and communication with IT so
that these two groups can develop a common language. But business process
experts, not IT managers, should be ultimately responsible for defining roles
in a way that achieves clean access control and avoids SoD violations.
By standardizing and centralizing role design, testing, and maintenance, tech-
nical experts and business process owners can speak a common language.
Taking these steps increases consistency and lowers IT costs. 
When you can’t segregate duties
If only one person handles accounting in a small branch office, you can’t
segregate those duties. In these cases, SoD is not the ultimate answer.
Sometimes duties can’t be segregated properly because of a small or
remote staff. Such cases require management oversight to ensure that
SoD violations are not occurring. Instead of segregation of duties through
access control, a compensating control needs to be put in place so that a
manager reviews the transactions entered by such employees. Chapter 7
describes these types of controls in more detail.
Staying Clean
After the roles are tidy, a method to detect violations, prevent further viola-
tions, and fix violations that have occurred — across systems, across
instances, and across applications — must be put into place. 
Change is constant, and as employees are promoted, go on vacation, are
transferred, or move to another company, the nice clean roles may get
messed up again. Staying clean requires continued vigilance and review as
these events take place to ensure that roles remain clean. Two things can
help companies stay clean: identity management that makes it clear who did
what (nice for auditing) and compliant user provisioning, which makes it
easy to set up users the right way the first time.
In the online world, we have all grown used to needing different usernames
and passwords for different Web sites. We all know the pain of forgetting
a password. In the corporate world, it is much the same — employees
need access to servers and applications, all with many different passwords
and different schedules for changing them. However, the pain of forgetting
a password in the corporate world is greater, and the cost of resetting a user
password is high — estimated at between $50 and $500 per password.
Identity management solutions allow employees to sign on once and have
their identities tracked throughout the system. This helps with auditability;
all transactions are associated with that person’s identity, no matter where
123
Chapter 6: Access Control and the Role of Roles

they are executed across the system landscape. Compared with correlating
multiple usernames and passwords from different systems, the audit trail
with identity management systems is much improved. 
Identity management helps keep track of who is doing what. Setting up users
is known as user provisioning. Users are given an identity that gives them
access to all the systems they need and assigns them the roles necessary to
do their jobs in a way that is free of SoD violations (which is why you’ll hear
it called compliant user provisioning). Because all of this setup work can be
complex without automation, it can take a long time — as much as a week —
to give new employees access to all the systems they will need. Automating
user provisioning accelerates this process to just a few hours — which
means workers are happy with the access they need and auditors are happy
because the access is clean from the start. 
Part of user provisioning relates to assigning roles with their associated
access. When a variance from an existing role is requested, a review process
should be put into place to see if such variances are really needed or if the
access can be handled in another way. The idea is, once again, to keep roles
clean and standard, known quantities, free of SoD violations and without those
“just for this user” variances that eventually create access control problems.
Managing Exceptional Access
What if you have a small branch office and just one accounting clerk? What if
you have year-end closing and need to grant exceptional access to the system?
Remember the master key? The key supervisor hands it out to someone who
needs it desperately, and never gets it back. The people who receive these
special keys are called superusers. Just like Superman, superusers have super-
powers and can do anything. 
Superuser access is hard to manage and risky to control, and yet it is some-
times needed. Some users are given carte blanche access, giving them free
access to all systems, all objects, all transactions. This is the worst case
scenario, because it means that their company has no control over who
does what.
Furthermore, one of the first questions external auditors ask is “How many
users have superuser access?”
For all these reasons, exceptional access needs to be managed carefully.
Rather than handing out such access freely, both IT and business need to
coordinate their work so that privileges can be granted, monitored, and
revoked in a timely fashion to prevent SoD violations.
124
Part II: Diving into GRC 

The SAP Approach: SAP GRC
Access Control
Like many of the dilemmas in GRC, automation can reduce the scope of the
effort and make day-to-day enforcement of business rules easier and more
cost effective. For example, a major retailer recently took its company public.
Before going public, the retailer had six employees scouring Excel spread-
sheets to validate that the company was not creating risks by giving one
employee too much access to any of the systems. It chose to automate this
process instead, saving considerable time and cost. 
SAP GRC Access Control provides a comprehensive, cross-enterprise set of
preventive and detective access controls that enables business managers,
auditors, and the IT team to define and oversee proper SoD enforcement. It
addresses risk analysis and remediation, enterprise role management, com-
pliant user provisioning, and superuser access management.
Risk analysis thoroughly scans existing roles to check for violations. This
analysis handles a heterogeneous system landscape, which means it encom-
passes not only SAP software but also enterprise applications from Oracle,
PeopleSoft, and JD Edwards. The application delivers a comprehensive data-
base of SoD rules that addresses all core processes (see Figure 6-1).
SAP GRC Access Control also offers oversight of exceptional access. When
special privileges are needed, a temporary ID grants the user regulated access.
Such a user may be given access to conflicting roles and be able to perform
Figure 6-1:

landscapes. 
125
Chapter 6: Access Control and the Role of Roles

certain emergency transactions, but everything that user does in the system is
logged in a report for scrutiny. The temporary ID is issued with an expiration
time or date, so that after a certain point, the user is logged out of the system.
The IDs are automatically revoked so that no follow-up is necessary.
Compliant user provisioning, another feature of SAP GRC Access Control,
streamlines adding users and ensures that as new users are added, access
control stays clean. The idea is to automate everything from one authorita-
tive source, usually the HR system, where you define a new user account. SAP
GRC Access Control detects the creation of a new account and interprets the
business role attached to the user account into technical roles. Once it
knows what this user does to perform his or her job, and what accesses are
needed, it can create a user account, an identity with a username and pass-
word, and all the information necessary to give this person the appropriate
access for his role.
SAP GRC Access Control also provides a documented log of events — who
had access to what, who put what kind of information in and who approved
access to what transaction. These are just the kind of things that warms an
auditor’s heart.
Where Do You Go from Here?
After a company has gotten clean and is staying clean, the idea is to stay in
control. The sprint phase is over, the access control muscles are fit and well-
trained, and it’s time for the marathon. By staying healthy, keeping their roles
clean and eyes open for SoD violations, a company will be prepared for the
auditor’s next visit.
Proper SoD and access control over sensitive transactions is one of the most
effective safeguards against fraud. This is usually difficult to deploy and sus-
tain given the thousands of users, roles, and processes that all require testing
and remediation. Automating this process helps ensure that access control is
handled cleanly and consistently.
In Chapter 7, we expand the discussion of controls from access control to
controls placed in business processes to ensure that business processes are
proceeding in an efficient and auditable fashion.

Chapter 7
Taking Steps toward Better
Internal Controls
In This Chapter
 Obtaining better internal controls
 Discovering the advantages of automated controls
 Putting automated controls into practice
A
lmost every problem that a company confronts can be traced back to
a lack of good internal controls. Good internal controls mean that you
know what is going on in the business, in every key business process. Strong
internal controls can also help you monitor and reduce risks. Internal controls
are really the essence of good governance, taking a policy and translating it
into the details of day-to-day business practices.
In this chapter, we look at the importance of good internal controls and how
automating those controls can streamline your business and help you catch
the exceptions to the rule. Finally, we look at the SAP solution for automating
internal controls: SAP GRC Process Control.
Understanding Internal Controls
Internal controls may mean different things to different people. To a clerk
in the purchasing department, having an internal control may mean double-
checking vendor invoices for inconsistencies; to a CEO, an internal control
may mean evolving a control policy to ensure effective overall governance.
Also, control owners and business process owners may find themselves at
loggerheads. A control owner is in charge of designing controls and making
sure they work properly to prevent problems. A business process owner, on
the other hand, is mainly concerned about running his or her department,
looking at the bottom line. If, for example, an employee is able to create a
vendor and pay a vendor, the control owner recognizes that this situation

urgently calls for a swift segregation of duties to mitigate risk. However, the
business process owner may believe that there is a legitimate need for the
dual responsibility. (Their concerns can be reconciled, as we’ll see later in
this chapter.)
Controls encompass all the actions, processes, or physical barriers that
direct or guide a resource to achieve a desired result. Often they prevent,
detect, or correct risks from becoming barriers to success. Here are some
different types of controls:
 Preventative controls: These controls prevent a bad event from happen-
ing. For example, a company may use a private network to ensure that
company data is not exposed to public networks.
 Detective controls: These controls determine whether a bad event has
already happened. For example, when a bank statement is received, it is
reconciled to the customer’s records to detect processing errors by the
bank or customer. 
 Corrective controls: These controls come into play once a problem is
discovered. An example would be removing access from users who have
excessive privileges or executing a backup and recovery plan after a
physical disaster has occurred.
The adoption of good internal controls in order to become SOX- (or regulation-)
compliant is a top-down process that starts with management. Management
recognizes that the regulations exist and cannot be ignored. They select a team
to define how the regulations, including the attendant standards and practices,
will be implemented as controls in the company. Control owners and business
process owners work out how to incorporate these regulations into the busi-
ness through automated controls.
After the controls become woven into the fabric of the company — sweeping
strategically across processes, locations, and systems — they help close off
avenues of risk. Companies may then enjoy such happy side-effects as pre-
venting unintentional errors, improving efficiency, and keeping auditors smil-
ing and building shareholder value in the process.
Exploring the Benefits of Better Controls
Companies have processes. These processes contain risks, which are barri-
ers to success and avenues for fraud and negligence. Therefore, companies
must have controls. Nowadays, with the compliance requirements of regula-
tions such as SOX, companies are trying to be more proactive about their
controls. Being more proactive about controls requires effort and input, but
also has many benefits. 
128
Part II: Diving into GRC 

Benefit one: Business process improvement
One byproduct of implementing strong internal controls is business process
improvement. When companies start to take a close look at their business
processes and document, measure, and monitor them, they can make them
more efficient and streamlined. It gives companies a chance to examine their
processes closely and ask themselves probing questions such as, “Why does
it take seven people for us to do something, when Company X only needs
three people to do the same thing?”
Benefit two: Management by exception
By establishing a norm (such as “The process works this way and when it
doesn’t, a control will alert us”), companies learn to manage by exception.
Controls start to function as a barometer of how things are operating in the
company — and give an early warning of how things could go awry, or an
indication of trends. Controls can also flag how companies need to change or
improve their processes. If companies don’t continue to assess their controls
and respond to the changes that controls indicate are necessary, they could
be considered negligent.
Benefit three: Real-time monitoring
Automated internal controls are like traffic cops. They prevent accidents (by
directing the flow of traffic), detect accidents (by listening to the radio), and
clean up after accidents (removing damaged cars and calling an ambulance
to take the injured to hospital). (We cover automated controls in more detail
in the section, “Seeing How Automated Controls Make Things Easier” later in
this chapter.)
Like traffic cops, automated internal controls can be on duty 24 hours a day,
seven days a week, monitoring both past activity and activity taking place in
real time. In any automated process, key points in the process should serve
as checkpoints to make sure that previous steps were completed and the
next processing step is ready for execution. In most companies, the checks
and balances used to monitor the automated processes rely on staff to
review reports or transactions to make sure that the transaction is recorded
accurately and in accordance with accepted accounting guidelines.
Before automation, auditors were the primary feedback loop to managers to
ensure that processes were operating effectively and efficiently. Auditors
played the role of traffic cop, but without automated internal controls, their
methods were not adequate. Auditors used sampling techniques — selecting
129
Chapter 7: Taking Steps toward Better Internal Controls

a sample of transactions and tracing them through a process, while giving
special attention to the checkpoints, and looking for evidence that staff had
reviewed reports.
Without automation, which covers so many more transactions in a shorter
period, auditors are limited as to how many tests they can perform within
their given review time. They take the results of their sample test and project
them to the entire population of transactions processed by the system.
Because of the gap between the testing methods and the processing meth-
ods, samples are not always representative of the total population.
As traffic cops, automated internal controls have the power to apply the
same method of testing on an ongoing basis. All transactions can be tested
and exceptions are more easily highlighted. Management can then address —
and report on — any exceptions.
130
Part II: Diving into GRC 
A lack of internal controls: The trading scandal 
at Societe Generale in Paris
A rogue trader at the French bank Societe
Generale somehow lost close to $7.1 billion by
engaging in secret, unauthorized derivatives
trades. According to a January 29, 2008, article
in the New York Times, the trader in question, 31-
year-old Jérôme Kerviel, admitted to French offi-
cials that he had placed the unauthorized trades,
which were actually worth around $70 billion —
more than the worth of the bank itself — before
many of them were reversed. 
Apparently, according to the same New York
Times article, once these trades were detected,
the bank was able to move quickly to stop many
of them, hence the loss of (just!) $7.1 billion.
And in a February, 6, 2008, Washington Post arti-
cle, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde
was quoted as saying that the internal controls
that Societe Generale had in place didn’t func-
tion and that when they did they weren’t prop-
erly followed up. 
Kerviel, for his part, also admitted to officials
that he had hacked his fellow employee’s com-
puters at the bank and penned fake emails to
cover his tracks. In one press report, a col-
league of Kerviel’s described him as a “com-
puter genius.”
Kerviel had apparently taken only four vacation
days in 2007, which he himself told police was an
obvious sign that a trader doesn’t want his
actions reviewed by supervisors or fellow
employees. If, for example, the human resources
department at the bank had a control in place to
warn them when an employee isn’t taking his or
her vacation days, a query to that person’s super-
visor could be sent asking them to check into the
matter. 
The case is far from settled as this book goes to
press, but Lagarde has already issued an 11-
page report, which suggests that banks gener-
ally focus more on internal fraud, involve
managers and committees in supervising risk
controls, reinforce internal controls over how
much money traders can risk, and raise the
fines that France’s banking commission can levy
on banks that violate regulations.

Benefit four: Mindset changes
Implementing automated controls requires more than changes to software.
Doing so also requires a mindset change. Management commits to a code of
ethics and to a new control consciousness, but they also have to ensure that
this filters down throughout the company.
Here is an example of how automation and better internal controls required a
mindset change. When companies implemented the automated procure-to-pay
process, vendors often complained that their invoices weren’t being paid. In
the old manual process, the accounting clerk would call the ordering depart-
ment and ask if the goods had been received or where the receiving documents
were in the process. In the automated process, the goods were delivered to the
ordering department but no paperwork was presented. Instead, the receiving
personnel were expected to enter the goods receipt into the system. The quan-
tity entered was then electronically compared to the invoiced receipt quantity.
Under the manual process, before the receiver could use the goods, the deliv-
ery person would ask for a signature. However, if the goods were delivered and
able to be used, there was no incentive for the recipient to enter their goods
receipt into the system. So when companies looked at the invoice receipts,
there were many items not covered by a goods receipt.
This imbalance held up many vendor payments — the system was not going
to pay an invoice for goods that were not received. It became essential to
report outstanding invoices without goods receipts as part of internal con-
trols to motivate employees to make timely entries.
Seeing How Automating Controls
Makes Things Easier
In the early 1990s, most companies had their own systems that they built to
run their accounting, purchasing, and personnel functions. With these sys-
tems came the necessary controls — sometimes as many as 500 of them. In
these home-grown systems, controls would be tested at various times, either
quarterly or at month-end, or, for some controls (such as three-way match),
perhaps only once a year. Typically, companies would manage their controls
in an Excel spreadsheet, with an attached control plan outlining the 10 to 15
steps to take if a particular control broke. This process was an extremely
intensive, laborious, and time-consuming.
Widespread adoption of enterprise resource planning (ERP) in the late 1990s
enabled companies, among other things, to automate their common processes.
ERP helped integrate each of the functional areas into an end-to-end process
131
Chapter 7: Taking Steps toward Better Internal Controls

that could be automated. After processes were automated, companies
needed to automate their checks too, and so automated internal controls
were born.
To understand how this changed the business landscape, look at one exam-
ple of a process before and after automation. Before automation, the procure-
to-pay process involved lots of paperwork: the ordering department would
send paperwork to the purchasing department, which would then select the
vendor, negotiate the price, and inform the ordering department of the
expected arrival. The purchasing department would send delivery informa-
tion to the warehouse or mailroom staff who would match the order with the
delivery manifests when the goods arrived. The goods would be delivered
and the receipt signed and sent to the accounting department. When the
vendor invoiced the company, the accounting department would compare
the invoice quantity with the received amounts. They would then verify that
the invoice price was equal to the order price, and schedule the payment
based on the invoice terms. The procure-to-pay process involved multiple
departments and a whole lot of paper.
Now, after procure-to-pay is automated, all the paperwork comparisons done
by people in the accounting department are no longer necessary. Instead,
when the order is entered, the received quantity is recorded and automati-
cally compared and the invoice is paid on schedule according to the invoice
terms. Also, the work of the purchasing department is minimized: A depart-
ment can create orders and preselect vendors without having to involve the
purchasing department in every transaction. When the goods arrive, the
recipient records this event during the receiving process, where the quanti-
ties received are compared with the quantities ordered. When purchasing
receives the vendor invoice, they can then compare the price and the quan-
tity before making payment.
The arduous paperwork and continuous checking is removed when a process
is automated. That’s because the software is doing the checking for you.
The newsletter Compliance Week’s series, GRC Illustrated, points out these
additional benefits of automated controls:
 Cheaper, with fewer errors: The average purchase-to-pay transaction
can be reduced from $12.03 to $8.58 when moving from a low to a high
level of automation. Automated transactions are between 10 and 25 per-
cent less prone to error.
 Better protection: Preventative controls embedded in a system cannot
be ignored and are not subject to interpretation.
 Quicker to detect and fix: There is little or no time lag between an event
occurring and being detected, so management can be notified immedi-
ately of a problem.
132
Part II: Diving into GRC 

 Embedded into core systems: When compliance is embedded rather
than bolted on, it enforces policies at the point of access and the point
of transaction.
 Simultaneous control and monitoring: A well-designed automated
control offers both control and monitoring. In effect, testing is built in.
Further, automated controls can produce reports that serve as their
own documentation. All of this makes an auditor’s job easier.
 Automatic evidence: Automated controls produce evidence on the fly,
in audit trails and transaction logs.
 Death of the sample: Some processes benefit from having every transac-
tion analyzed, instead of just a sampling. Some precarious patterns and
trends only reveal themselves when all transactions of a particular type
are scrutinized.
 Ripple effect: The operational benefits to implementing controls extend
beyond financial compliance. Companies can use the principles of gover-
nance, risk, and compliance to improve all business processes by intro-
ducing transactional, master data, and configurable controls to help
monitor processes, and then improve them.
Automated internal controls are like speed cameras; they catch every single
violation of a control instead of the occasional scofflaw. And like speed cam-
eras, they reduce effort — after you install speed cameras on a highway or
residential street, police officers don’t have to sit around with radar guns
looking for cars going over the speed limit, pulling them over, and writing
tickets. Figure 7-1 illustrates the reduced effort and increased efficiency of
automated controls.

Chapter 7: Taking Steps toward Better Internal Controls

Taking Five Steps to Better
Internal Controls
The evolution and automation of internal controls have a number of advan-
tages for companies — lowered costs, fewer errors, management by excep-
tion, and regulatory compliance. And, by improving internal controls in a
particular area, companies can take the lessons learned and then scale those
improved controls out to the whole organization.
There are five steps to a healthy internal control environment:
 Documentation
 Testing
 Remediation
 Analysis
 Optimization
In the next few sections, we look at each in more detail.
Documentation: The mapping exercise
A company looks at SOX and other regulations to see which areas of their
business are going to be affected by the regulation’s requirements. They then
go through an intensive mapping process, identifying the business processes,
subprocesses, and departments that are involved.
The next step is to highlight the risks and compliance issues. For example,
when someone is taking orders from new customers, they need to make sure
that a credit check is performed every time. The company should develop a
control that will be done from outside its order-taking system that checks all
transactions and reports back on whether the system is running credit
checks for all new customers.
Then companies develop controls. Manual controls tend to be vulnerable to
human error or fraud, so companies automate as many of their internal con-
trols as they can. They write scripts or programs that will be kicked off on a
preset basis to perform control checks and then report back. Some manual
controls will still be needed, but automated controls can substantially reduce
the amount of work needed to monitor controls.
134
Part II: Diving into GRC 

Testing: Real-time and historical
After the documentation phase, companies then implement control checks,
either preventative checks, such as those that seek out Segregation of Duties
(SoD) violations, or detective checks, which are after-the-fact checks on what
happened (historical) or what’s happening right now (real-time). By automat-
ing both real-time and historical checks, a company can form a clearer idea of
how their business is operating.
Remediation: Fixing the problem
When an internal control flags an issue — either a control violation or a con-
trol failure — someone must fix it. The control software should automatically
create a case in the system that includes all the details of what happened,
why the case has been created, what control has failed, and who is going to
fix it. The system should ensure that cases are automatically assigned to the
people who are responsible for that business area: the business process
owners as well as the control owners.
When the system creates a case, it should notify the control owner that they
are responsible for investigating the failure, and notify the business process
owner that a problem has been found and that she is now responsible for
fixing it.
Responsibilities for fixing the problem differ depending on what happened
with the control. Investigation of the problem could show that there’s a con-
trol failure instead of a control violation. In the case of a control failure, such
as a control that raises false positives, only the control owner needs to adjust
the control and run it again to make sure it’s working.
In the case of a control violation, the work mainly falls to the business
process owner, who must then fix the problem. When the business-process
owner fixes the problem, she records all activities: what she did, how it’s
going to solve the problem, and why it will no longer be an issue. After she
records all of that, she can close the case. She runs the control again and
makes sure that it passes this time.
Analysis: Reports for management
In the analysis phase, managers report on the control environment. The
senior management in charge of compliance (whether it’s the compliance
team, the Chief Financial Officer, Chief Risk Officer or the Compliance Vice
135
Chapter 7: Taking Steps toward Better Internal Controls

President) runs reports: what controls have run recently, how many failed,
and which business processes are most at risk. The most important of these
reports is always that which impacts a significant account, or anything that
ends up on the income statement.
The reports are available so that companies can measure and analyze their reg-
ulatory compliance. At a board meeting, management will now ask, “How are
we doing with regard to financial compliance?” and having this quick, up-to-the-
minute status will enable them to ascertain how compliant the company is.
Optimization: Barring risk
Finally, the control software should optimize controls by preventing risks from
entering enterprise applications. Companies that implement preventative
measures such as compliant change control (see Chapter 13) and compliant
user provisioning (see Chapter 6) will see a reduction in control violations
because risk never enters the enterprise applications that they use to run
their business.
Getting to Know the SAP Approach:
SAP GRC Process Control
SAP GRC Process Control is a single solution for enterprise control manage-
ment. It provides centralized control management for automated and manual
controls. It enables management by exception: It prioritizes remediation
activities and gives managers visibility into what is happening in the control
environment. In the next few sections, we look at the highlights of the SAP
GRC Process Control solution.
SAP GRC Process Control provides a single system for automated and manual
controls. It manages financial controls, operational controls, and IT controls
across multiple enterprise systems and aims to improve controls through reg-
ular assessments. Figure 7-2 provides an overview of the bottom-up structure
of SAP GRC Process Control.
Single system of record
To ensure good governance, you need a single system of record. SAP GRC
Process Control includes the SAP GRC Repository, which documents and
stores records for all governance, risk, and compliance information across
136

a company. SAP GRC Process Control leverages all this information and links
it to security frameworks like COSO and COBIT and legislation like SOX, so
that companies gain a clear understanding of their control matrix. It also
helps you to avoid redundancies, take controls and reuse them in different
contexts, and identify control gaps.
Continuous monitoring
SAP GRC Process Control monitors business process controls for fraud,
abuse, and inefficiencies. It continuously checks for weaknesses in master
data and configuration set-ups and flags specific transactions that show
heightened risks across your company’s critical processes, such as procure-
to-pay, order-to-cash, and reconcile-to-report. (See the next section for more
details on the controls for these vital processes.)
SAP GRC Process Control helps eliminate false positives by integrating
directly with enterprise applications and enables your company to drill down
on supporting data for faster solutions to problems.
Out-of-the-box monitoring
SAP GRC Process Control has a predefined rule set for SAP and non-SAP soft-
ware that companies can adjust with their own parameters to create a wide
variety of custom controls. Companies can quickly ramp up and get controls in

place because they don’t have to create them from scratch. SAP GRC Process
Control delivers automated controls monitoring for the following business
processes:
 Reconcile to Report: The financial close process is extremely vulnerable
to errors and miscalculation, particularly if a company has multiple loca-
tions and financial applications. SAP GRC Process Control guards against
these risks by closely monitoring subledgers, general ledgers, and finan-
cial consolidations, while at the same time enabling companies to
reduce manual controls, streamline the financial close, and ensure the
accuracy of financial results.
 Order to Cash: The order to cash business process concludes with rev-
enue recognition, making it vital that companies have the right controls
in place to prevent human error or intentional fraud. With SAP GRC
Process Control, companies can implement automated process control
monitoring to identify revenue leakage, improper shipping cut-offs, and
other potentially fraudulent activities. In doing so, companies ensure
control effectiveness and efficiency for their order management, inven-
tory, accounts receivable, and general ledger applications.
 Procure to Pay: SAP GRC Process Control controls the efficiency and
efficacy of the purchasing, inventory, and accounts payable applications
by helping companies to enforce corporate procurement policies and
reduce spending on goods and services. Companies can monitor the
real-time status of procure-to-pay activities as they are processed by
multiple applications across the enterprise, giving them better visibility
into how transactions are affecting working capital. It helps them elimi-
nate duplicate vendor payments, lost discounts, and improperly valued
inventory.
End-to-end internal controls
What are some of the other advantages of having end-to-end internal con-
trols? For one thing, internal and external auditors will be relieved of the
onerous task of sifting through hundreds of transactions. Instead, the system
will provide them with reports.
SAP GRC Process Control helps companies monitor controls across their IT
landscapes to ensure proper change management and to prevent risks from
being introduced into production environments. These controls help ensure
the integrity of enterprise system data, the reliability of application process-
ing, and the proper development and implementation of software.
138
Part II: Diving into GRC 

Of course, some controls require human intervention. SAP GRC Process
Control supports manual control activities with smooth, workflow-driven
procedures that automatically notify the appropriate people of tasks and
action items and remove potential confusion. When control testers are
unable to respond quickly, workflows escalate or reroute notifications.
Testers are walked through guided procedures, and approved spreadsheet
templates and policy documents help minimize data collection errors.
Control testers can attach files and documents to serve as evidence of work
done, while the software maintains a complete audit trail and change history
of work done. SAP GRC Process Control also captures the monetary risk
quantification for failed tests, letting you know not only what went wrong
but how much that risk could cost you if it’s not mitigated. 
SAP GRC Process Control provides remediation case management. It detects
global exceptions and prioritizes corrective action. The workflow-based noti-
fications alert users to failed tests or assessments while documenting remedi-
ation activities and resolutions. Dashboards and reporting help provide
insight into failed controls as well as allowing you to drill down for details
about how to address the underlying problem being identified. 
SAP GRC Process Control also helps companies prevent control exceptions
from turning into material weaknesses by providing real-time visibility into all
GRC activities. Companies can use a geographical heat-map that superimposes
their business over a particular operating region, allowing them to identify
trouble spots for control exceptions and drill down for answers. Companies
can assign cases for fixing on the centralized remediation workbench, and
actions are tracked, documented, and measured.
The product can normalize the certification process by providing a hierarchi-
cal bottom-up progression of sign-off activities from business process owners
to location owners, corporate signers, and up to the CFO/CEO. Sign-off status
is monitored through dashboards and reports to ensure that executives are
kept informed of progress.

T
he world is growing smaller every day. Sure, it’s a cliché, but when it comes
to trade it’s never been truer. More and more, we are buying goods from
other countries, and we are sending our exports abroad. (Figure 8.1 illustrates
the sharp growth in exports.) We live in an age of unprecedented globalization.
Today, a doctor in India might analyze X-rays from a patient in London, or a
Japanese auto company might build cars with Brazilian parts in a factory in
the United States. The pace of exchange is only speeding up as new free trade
treaties are inked from Central America to East Asia. Companies are increas-
ingly sourcing, manufacturing, and distributing goods on a global basis.
The open doors mean business opportunities, but they also mean new
headaches. Managing global trade adds an extra layer of complexity to any
business. It’s one thing to source a widget from Walla Walla, but an entirely
different experience to get it from a factory in Guangzhou, Bangalore, or
Minsk. How do you ensure the widget arrives at the same time every month?
What global trade treaties need to be complied with? How can you track all
the documentation?
When it comes to exporting goods, how do you ensure that the thousands of
orders you ship every day don’t end up in an embargoed country or, worse
yet, in the hands of terrorists? You’re probably thinking “Wait . . . terrorists?!?”
Before you reach for the antacid, read on.
By creating an organized system for dealing with global imports and exports,
these challenges and others can be effectively managed. This chapter gives
you an understanding of how global trade works and the best practices to
put in place to ensure you meet the requirements of global trade regulations.

Understanding Four Reasons Why Global
Trade Is So Complex
Four major bottlenecks lead to problems in global trade. By understanding
each of them, you can begin to understand how to put together a strategy to
manage them. The four major reasons why global trade can be tricky are
 Long supply chains
 New regulations and security initiatives
 Modernization of government IT systems
 Increasingly complex regulations

How does global trade relate to GRC?
For companies involved in importing or export-
ing any part of their value chain, the C in GRC is
familiar. Global trade requires tremendous effort
in the area of compliance. Companies that don’t
comply with global trade regulations face fines,
penalties, or the possibility that their goods are
stuck somewhere gathering dust because the
proper paperwork hasn’t been filed. You can
easily translate these implications into risks, the
R in GRC. For example, in addition to compliance
issues, global trade presents risks because it is
often difficult to forecast when goods will be
delivered. Putting the proper policies and pro-
cedures in place ensures that a company has
an effective governance structure for global
trade.

In the next few sections, we look at each in detail.
Long supply chains
Cross border transactions accounted for $10 trillion in trade in 2007. That
figure is expected to grow to more than $70 trillion by 2025. The world is being
knit into one giant marketplace. Companies are selling more goods overseas,
manufacturers are sourcing parts and goods from overseas suppliers, and
companies are outsourcing production to a number of foreign nations to save
money. Figure 8-2 shows the leading importers while Figure 8-3 shows leading
exporters.
The length of supply chains brings up new problems many companies aren’t
prepared for. How do you get the goods out of a foreign country? You may
discover, for example, that it takes 50 days to import parts from China one
month, but 55 days the next month. This uncertainty forces many companies
to keep expensive safety stock on hand. These issues also feed into the deci-
sion about where to source goods from. For example, it may be more expen-
sive to source goods from Vietnam than China, but the Vietnamese delivery is
more predictable. In that case, it might actually be easier to just source the
parts from Vietnam. Duties and tariffs also must be figured into the costs of
global trade.

New regulations and security initiatives
Have you been hassled at airport security checkpoints recently? Taking off
your shoes, getting rid of nail clippers, and having the contents of your luggage
rifled through became common after September 11, 2001. But the terrorist
attacks also meant increased inspections on the import and export of goods.
Governments around the world enacted new regulations and security initia-
tives in the wake of the attacks. The United States and other countries have
tried to ensure dangerous materials that could be used to make bombs or
other weapons aren’t shipped to terrorists. Therefore, companies shipping
abroad need special licenses from the government to ship certain products.
Governments also restrict certain goods, such as firearms, from being
shipped to certain people or organizations. The act of managing the export
or import of these controlled goods is known as “product-level compliance.”
Governments also issue outright bans on shipping anything to certain indi-
viduals or groups, such as terrorist-related organizations. The act of manag-
ing and monitoring all the people and entities in the supply chain is known as
“party-level compliance.” To make things more complicated, there are more
than 50 different “restricted party” lists that various governments and gov-
ernment agencies have developed and update on a daily basis.
Violations of these regulations can result in large fines and even jail time for
company executives (see the “$100 million export fine” sidebar elsewhere in
this chapter for more information). President Bush recently signed into law

(IEEPA) that increases the maximum fines for violating export control laws
from $50,000 per violation to $250,000, or twice the amount of the transaction
that is the basis of the violation with respect to which the penalty is imposed.
The maximum criminal penalties for committing willful violations of IEEPA-
based export control laws will increase to $1,000,000, with a maximum jail
sentence of 20 years.
Finally, you also have to be aware of the additional layer of embargoes and
sanctions. For example, shipping goods to Cuba, under most circumstances,
is illegal for U.S. companies.
Modernization of government IT systems
Governments are notoriously slow adapters of new technology, so it may
come as no surprise that many are just now automating systems for keeping
track of import and export documentation. Nevertheless, companies must
have systems in place to interface with various customs authorities electroni-
cally. Here are a few of the key international customs players and how they
handle import and export documentation:
 United States: Exporters are required to electronically file the export
declaration via the U.S. Census Bureau’s Automated Export System
(AES). U.S. Customs has also automated its import system, which is
called the Automated Broker Interface (ABI). Certified licensed brokers
usually handle the filing of import documents for most companies
because the process is so highly complicated. However, a growing
number of companies are self-filing these days because doing so is
cheaper and they can control their own data. Another key development
is the Automated Commercial Environment or ACE, which represents a
business process transformation on the part of Customs that will help
electronically speed legitimate trade while providing greater security.
The frequently asked questions document on ACE is 113 pages long,
indicating that there will be quite the learning curve when and if the
Automated Commercial Environment becomes a reality.
 European Union: The E.U. embarked on a six-year program to modern-
ize its customs systems in 2004. The European eCustoms Initiative will
create a paperless environment for customs and trade documentation.
All 25 E.U. member states will be on the common system by 2010. The
initiative includes the New Computerized Transit System (NCTS), the
Automated Export System (AES), and in 2008, the Automated Import
System (AIS).
 Australia: Australia has put in place an electronic system for customs
clearance called the Integrated Cargo System (ICS). Companies are able
to access customs and other government agencies through a single elec-
tronic window.
145
Chapter 8: It's a Small World: Effectively Managing Global Trade

Increasing complexity of regulations
The explosion in global trade has resulted in an equally large increase in trade
regulations. A typical cross-border shipment can involve more than 25 parties
and create 35 documents. It gets even more staggering: There are more than
600 trade laws and 500 trade agreements to be considered when shipping
internationally. Keeping up with the document trail can be maddening.
According to a 2003 report from the Aberdeen Group, “Ensuring that ship-
ments comply with international shipping regulations is one of the most time-
consuming aspects of trade.” The situation hasn’t gotten any better since this
statement was made. Additionally, importers and exporters must frequently
deal with a variety of agencies in the same country to ensure that they are
in compliance with, for example, the U.S. State Department as well as the
Department of Commerce. 
In addition, here are some terms that can help you through some of the
alphabet soup of security initiatives and regulations created by government
bureaucracy:
 International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR): A set of government
regulations that control the import and export of defense goods and
services, such as guns and munitions (and this can include military

Considering importing or exporting:
Points to ponder
Here are some basic questions for you to keep
in mind when setting up your importing and
exporting system:
 Which laws and regulations do I have to
consider?
 How do I classify products and calculate
duties?
 How do I ensure electronic communica-
tions with customs authorities?
 How do I ensure I have the right import and
export documents?
 How can I keep track of inventory at a cus-
toms warehouse?
 Can I take advantage of international trade
agreements?
 Can I claim refunds on my exports?
 How can I mitigate the financial risks of
importing and exporting?

technology, such as encryption or night vision goggles). It requires that
defense-related items only be shared with U.S. citizens, unless special
approval is given by the State Department.
 Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT): A voluntary
U.S. Customs regulatory program that aims to keep terrorists from
infiltrating the supply chain in the United States. The program requires
important import/export businesses such as importers, rail lines,
airlines, cargo companies, and others to certify their supply chain
security procedures and share their security guidelines with their
business partners.
 Export Administration Regulations (EAR): Part of the US Commerce
Department, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) implements
and enforces the EAR regulations. Commercial products as well as
“dual use” items that have both commercial and military use fall
under EAR regulations.
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act: It may not seem like an act that was passed to
ensure greater corporate accountability in the wake of Enron and
other scandals would impact global trade regulation, but it does. The
act requires company officials to verify the accuracy of financial state-
ments including the values of imports and exports. It is also important
to maintain a paper trail in case of an audit. 
 Container Security Initiative (CSI): No, it’s not a TV show. CSI is a US
Customs and Border Patrol initiative passed in 2002 and is focused on
ensuring that terrorists are not able to deliver goods by ship.
 REACH: Passed in June 2007 and coming into effect in phases, the EU’s
Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical sub-
stances (REACH) legislation will impact many companies who export
products to the EU. For more information on REACH compliance, see
Chapter 12.
 Harmonized Tariff Schedules: The HTS comprises a hierarchical struc-
ture for describing all goods in trade for duty, quota, and statistical
purposes. This structure is based upon the international Harmonized
Commodity Description and Coding System (HS), administered by the
World Customs Organization in Brussels. Accurately classifying your
goods according to the HTS is one of the most tedious and important
steps when exporting or importing products.
Now that you have an idea of some of the challenges facing companies that
want to trade internationally, let’s look at some best practices for setting up
a global trade process on both the import and the export side.
147
Chapter 8: It's a Small World: Effectively Managing Global Trade

Figuring Out the Complexities
of Importing
Importing and exporting are vastly different processes. Importing goods
is mainly about figuring out how to speed your items through customs,
whereas exporting is much more about making sure your company complies
with regulations, such as embargoes and restricted party lists. In this chap-
ter, we start by looking at importing, which is broken down into a number
of steps.
Classifying an item: What is it?
One of the most difficult, expensive, and time-consuming elements of import-
ing goods begins before the item even arrives at the border. The importer
must classify the good, or assign it a 10-digit code called a Harmonized Tariff
Schedule. Customs authorities use the number to determine the tariffs and
duties an importer pays. Specifically, the first six numbers of the code are
the same for a particular item in every country (that’s the harmony in the
Harmonized Tariff Schedule). The last four numbers vary from country to
country, but describe the item more specifically and provide information for
the statistical purposes of tracking trade.
Classifying an item is difficult because the importer must take into considera-
tion all of the things that make up the item. For example, a simple item such
as a t-shirt can be classified in many ways depending on where it’s manufac-
tured, as well as its material, color, stitching, and packaging. For more com-
plicated items, the complexity quickly escalates and, for the most part, can’t
be determined without the blueprints of the product itself.
Because the process is so complicated, most companies outsource the classi-
fication process to law firms that specialize in the area. Unfortunately, this
option is expensive and slow.
Classifying a product is also important when determining where to source
goods from. The import duties and taxes can have a major impact on the cost
of a good. For example, it might cost $8 to manufacture a good in China, but
$10 in Vietnam. The tariff on the item is $5 from China, but only $2 from
Vietnam. Even though it is cheaper to manufacture the good in China, it
would actually be cheaper to source it from Vietnam.
148
Part II: Diving into GRC 

Making way for the goods: Pre-clearance
After a product is classified, the import process begins. An importer or buyer
creates a purchase order inside an order management system. The importer
sends the purchase order to the exporter, who arranges for the items to be
transferred to a port to get shipped or flown out of the country. At the same
time, the exporter sends an Advanced Shipping Notice (ASN) to the importer
or to the broker the importer has hired to guide the import process. The ASN
lists the items and their value so the importer can calculate the duty and pre-
pare the proper import documents.
The whole idea is to finish all this paperwork before the goods arrive, so they
can speed through customs to get to your store or factory.
Making it through: Clearing Customs
The next step is clearing goods through customs. Most companies outsource
this task to a customs broker, but a few larger companies, such as Wal-Mart,
handle it in house. Most companies rely on a broker because the process is
complex and requires a special license to clear items through customs. For
U.S. Customs, the two key documents that must be filed are forms 3461 and
7501, which tell Customs what the importer is bringing into the country. This
is known as making an entry. As mentioned earlier, U.S. Customs now requires
these items to be filed electronically. Most companies use the data from the
purchase order to populate these forms, which are then sent to the customs
broker. If the importer is a self-filer, the forms are filed directly with Customs’
Automated Broker Interface. When the documentation is completed, the
goods are trucked (also known as drayage) to a warehouse and then distrib-
uted to the importer’s store or factory.
Reconciling value: The step
most often missed
One of the most important steps in the importing process is one that many
companies never take: reconciling the product values they declared in their
backend systems with the actual value customs assigned to the items. This
value is known as the Customs Declared Value and it can be very different
from the value the importer originally listed. The difference between these
values represents an unreconciled inconsistency in the accounting system.
The issue of proper reconciliation has become especially important because
the Sarbanes Oxley Act requires that company officials verify the accuracy of
financial statements, of which import values are a critical part.
149
Chapter 8: It's a Small World: Effectively Managing Global Trade

Getting the lead out: Brand protection
One theme that you’ll see again and again in this book is that the buck essen-
tially never stops. Companies are partnered in long and complex value chains
around the world. And guess what? You can’t say you’re responsible just for
your part because the marketplace, and increasingly, the government says
otherwise. Mattel learned this lesson quite painfully in 2007 when its brand
became synonymous with lead paint on toys. Laws like the Foreign Trade
Corrupt Practices Act, which relates to bribery in other countries, mean that
legally and in terms of your brand, you and your partners are one big family
and as we all know, what one family member does affects all the rest.
Making Sure You’re Complying with All
19,391 Exporting Restrictions
Exporting is generally less complex than importing, but there are a whole
different set of challenges involved. Violating export laws and regulations
can carry a much greater cost in terms of fines and damage to a company’s
reputation than similar violations on the import side. (And no, there probably
aren’t really 19,391 exporting restrictions, but sometimes it seems like it!)
Knowing who you’re dealing with
An exporter must understand who he is dealing with at all times. There are
two possible pitfalls:
 Shipping to someone on a restricted parties list
 Shipping to someone in an embargoed or sanctioned country
In the wake of Sept. 11, countries have put in place additional security mea-
sures to ensure that dangerous goods don’t fall into the hands of terrorist
groups. This has resulted in a profusion of restricted party lists, or individu-
als or groups that can’t have goods shipped to them. The difficulty for busi-
nesses is that there are more than 50 restricted party lists around the world
and some countries — such as the United States — have more than one list
for different agencies. To make matters more confusing, these lists are regu-
larly updated, so keeping on top of changes can be extremely hard. Third-
party companies monitor and update these lists, which can be purchased
and downloaded for use with global trade software.
150
Part II: Diving into GRC 

Companies must also make sure they do not ship goods to sanctioned or
embargoed countries. This seems straightforward, but many companies fail
to grasp how these regulations actually work. If a company is U.S. owned, it
must comply with U.S. embargoes and sanctions. For example, that means
that, with few exceptions, a U.S. company with operations in Canada can’t
ship goods to Cuba because the U.S. has an embargo on Cuba.
Checking restricted parties lists and embargoed countries might not sound
so bad until you consider scale. Many companies are shipping thousands
of orders a day to dozens of different countries, and there are more than
50 restricted parties lists around the world. Checking those orders against
all those lists can quickly become a logistical nightmare. However, there are
ways to smooth the process by automating it (see the last section in this
chapter for details).
Obtaining the right export licenses
Exporters must also track whether a product needs an export license, which
is required for certain classes of goods, such as firearms, advanced technol-
ogy, and medical devices. These products are called controlled goods. How
do you know whether you need an export license? In the U.S., you find
out through the Commerce Department’s Web site (www.bis.doc.gov/
licensing/exportingbasics.htm). Using this site, you can find out
whether the item you are trying to export has an Export Control Classification
Number (ECCN), which means you need a license to export that item. Items
that are not controlled fall under and are referred to as EAR99 or NLR (No
License Required).
151
Chapter 8: It's a Small World: Effectively Managing Global Trade
The $100 million export fine
Just how serious are penalties for not complying
with global trade regulations? Try $100 million
serious. In March 2007, a prominent American
company agreed to plead guilty and pay a fine of
up to $100 million for failing to obtain the proper
export license for shipping night vision goggles
parts to China, Singapore, and Great Britain. The
company also pled guilty to leaving information
off of arms exports reports from 2000 to 2004. U.S.
Justice Department officials said the company
was willingly violating the export restrictions and
didn’t take action to stop the violations until the
department found out what was going on. The
company faced two major problems: it shipped
the wrong items and it shipped them to the
wrong destinations.

Knowing how the product will be used
The first important question to ask when you’re exporting is who you’re
exporting to. The second important question is what is the item and what will
it be used for. The company with the $100 million export fine didn’t violate
the who — they violated the what. The company knowingly shipped a prod-
uct with a military use out of the U.S. without the proper permission.
Here are some of the major compliance concepts governments use to deter-
mine if a company has followed global trade guidelines:
 End use: Before exporting an item, you have to think about what it is,
who will get it, and what it might ultimately be used for. Under global
trade compliance regulations, a company that ships an item overseas
can be held responsible if the buyer uses it for an illegal purpose, or if
the buyer turns around and sells it to someone else, who uses it illegally.
 Dual use: A company can also be held responsible if it ships a product to
a buyer that uses it in an unintended way that is illegal or harmful. For
example, a reputable medical supply company sold plasma filters to a
medical organization in Europe. The filters ultimately ended up in the
hands of a terrorist organization that found they could be used to filter
anthrax just as effectively. This example raises the question of how a

company could know all the ways its products could be used maliciously.
The answer is that the company must take reasonable care and once such
nefarious uses are brought to light, it must attempt to guard against them.
 Reasonable care: The Customs Modernization Act of 1993 has made it
the responsibility of all importers and exporters to take affirmative steps
to ensure compliance with the Customs laws. For organizations, a compli-
ance program must be institutionalized, both to set up proper procedural
safeguards and to ensure that all employees understand what is required.
When the government audits a company, they want to see if the company
has demonstrated “reasonable care” to comply with the law.
These regulations may be unsettling, especially for companies that ship sen-
sitive materials, but there are ways to ensure you don’t fall victim to one of
these violations. The compliance regulations include a provision called rea-
sonable care, which means if a company can demonstrate it did everything
possible to avoid an illegal end use or dual use, it may not be held responsi-
ble for the misuse. 
Taking Advantage of the System:
Trade Preference Management
Trade agreements and most favored nation status can make doing business
in certain countries much more attractive. For example, the North American
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) eliminated trade tariffs on many goods traded
between the United States, Canada, and Mexico including agriculture, cars,
textiles, and computers.
Such agreements allow companies to qualify for duty-free exports as long as
the goods meet certain criteria. Many companies leave millions of dollars on
the table each year by not taking advantage of these agreements because it
requires personnel or knowledge they don’t have. Companies should think
about taking advantage of global trade preferences.
Discovering the Different Ways
to Manage Global Trade
As you have seen, managing global trade is only slightly less complicated
than bringing about world peace or landing a man on the moon. So how do
companies manage it? Historically, the answer has been not very well because
there has not been a truly great way of tackling global trade tasks on both the
importing and exporting sides. 
153
Chapter 8: It's a Small World: Effectively Managing Global Trade

Some companies have done little to comply with restricted parties lists.
They have either been ignorant of restricted parties lists or have hoped they
wouldn’t get caught shipping items to banned individuals.
Other companies have managed to comply with the regulations in a limited
way by using manual means, but at great expense of time and money. For
example, an employee at a company might compare a handful of interna-
tional sales orders against various restricted party lists. If it’s a major com-
pany with hundreds or thousands of sales orders each day, the employee
might only be able to ensure a fraction of the sales orders are not violating
import and export regulations.
This is no way to run a global trade operation in today’s security-charged
environment. In fact, you might be a little freaked out at this point with all the
talk of terrorists, restricted party lists, export licenses, and myriad regula-
tions. Fortunately, there are applications that can take the heavy lifting out of
global trade management. Global trade management software can automate
nearly all of the tasks, including checking automatically to ensure that you
don’t ship goods without a license or to a restricted party.
Using the SAP Approach: SAP GRC
Global Trade Services
SAP GRC Global Trade Services manages all the complexities of international
trade including full regulatory compliance and management of risk while
trading on a global basis. It consists of separate modules that enable compa-
nies to improve their supply chain and comply with international regulations.
SAP GRC Global Trade Services automates the key tasks needed to effectively
trade with partners around the world. What’s more, SAP GRC Global Trade
Services is integrated with SAP’s other GRC solutions, such as SAP GRC Risk
Management (see Chapter 2).
The product requires minimal installation and ramp-up time; it is installed on
a single server, and there is no client software to install. Authorized users
around the world can access the application via their Web browsers.
Components of the solution include
 Export management: Automates and streamlines complex export
processes to ensure faster delivery to customers by minimizing delays
at national borders while ensuring compliance with relevant regulations
and mitigating the financial risk of global transactions. 
154
Part II: Diving into GRC 

 Import management: Helps to expedite customs clearance for import
shipments to reduce costly buffer stock and implement just-in-time
inventory management. SAP GRC Global Trade Services allows you
to easily classify products, calculate duties, streamline electronic
communication with customs authorities, ensure import compliance,
and efficiently manage letters of credit. 
 Trade preference management: Helps you make the most of interna-
tional trade agreements with capabilities to solicit vendor declarations,
determine the eligibility of products for preferential treatment, and issue
certificates of origin to customers.
 Restitution management: Enables you to manage and calculate the resti-
tution for the export of common agricultural products (CAP) out of the
European Union with capabilities to assign securities, manage export
licenses, maintain recipes, and calculate and apply for refunds. 
SAP GRC Global Trade Services automates, streamlines, and standardizes the
global trade compliance tasks that many companies have ignored or struggled
with in the past. Many companies have manual compliance systems, which
are slow and require a large staff to carry out. SAP GRC Global Trade Services
also saves money by keeping tasks in house — such as classifying products —
that were once outsourced, and by helping companies take advantage of
global trade preferences in international trade treaties. Most importantly, SAP
GRC Global Trade Services helps companies avoid hefty fines or even jail time
that can result from failing to comply with global trade regulations.

G
oing green. Everyone has heard the phrase, but what exactly does it
mean? It’s rapidly becoming one of the day’s trendiest catchphrases,
but the idea behind going green conveys a deep truth about a way of living
that individuals and businesses would do well to adopt. The focus? What is
happening to the earth and how it affects our quality of life, not to mention
the potential financial impacts.
When individuals go green, they demonstrate their concern for the preserva-
tion, restoration, and improvement of the natural environment in just about
everything they do. They express consideration for conserving natural
resources and preventing pollution, from how much water they use while
taking a shower or washing the dishes, to the quantity and type of fuel their
vehicles consume, to the products they use to clean and the sources of
energy they tap to heat and cool their homes.
In particular, people are increasingly concerned about how energy produc-
tion using fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas impacts the environment, and,
in turn, our future quality of life. They are also making choices based on
whether products and services are earth friendly, ethically produced and
made, recyclable, and energy-efficient.
When a business goes green, whether it is a global leviathan, such as Shell Oil
or a small but bourgeoning startup in the discrete manufacturing industry, that
business demonstrates its commitment to these matters, which are increas-
ingly becoming government mandates or regulations. In addition, however,
green businesses are also obligated to enhance the health and safety programs
for both their employees and the public, at times on a global level.

This is why, unlike today’s consumers, most companies don’t really have a
great deal of leeway when it comes to going green. Of course, they have a
hand in the extent to which they green themselves, but they must all comply
to a minimum degree with an expanding battery of environmental directives
and standards that are inextricably tied up with — yes, you guessed it — GRC.
This chapter introduces the various issues your company needs to consider
before it takes the leap into the wild green yonder, from the benefits your com-
pany stands to reap from voluntarily going as green as possible to the harm
you risk by insisting that the color you are now — whatever it may be — is
just fine and dandy.
Whether you are committed to the principles of environmental stewardship
or have given little thought to the ways your company’s processes and prod-
ucts affect the world and its people, this chapter is designed to demystify
what it means to go green and show you how to make choices that reduce
your company’s impact on the environment. You also find out that the sooner
you start to build a more nature-friendly company, the happier, healthier, and
safer you, your employees, your customers, your neighbors, and the rest of
the planet will be.
Discovering the Three Ps of Going Green:
People, Processes, and Products
The business world today is one of environmental plans that are as global-
ized as they are country-specific. It is a world of high-profile failures and suc-
cesses that can make or break not simply a corporation’s fiscal year but the
corporation itself. It is a world, as well, of complex legislation ranging from
laws that protect the tufted plover of Lower Tasmania to those that guarantee
the rights of both a company’s employees and the communities that are
affected by the waste products of the company’s production efforts.
It is a world, in short, of environmental governance, risk, and compliance
management: a mix of legislation, common sense, and PR smarts that com-
bine to form a policy expressive of a company’s overall philosophy and
worldview. For a business to maintain a balanced environmental, health, and
safety policy, it must constantly juggle three vital factors: its people,
processes, and products. Managed smartly, however, the rewards of compli-
ance can be as big as they are surprising.
The next few chapters explore in detail each of the three components in your
company’s overall green routine: your people, processes, and products.
Chapter 10 focuses on keeping employees safe; Chapter 11 covers making
sure your processes are green; and Chapter 12 delves into the issue of
making environmentally friendly products.

Going Green: It’s Not Just 
for Tree-Huggers Anymore
No doubt about it, global warming is changing the earth and with it, the way
companies conduct their business. Nicholas Stern, an adviser to the British
government and the former head of the World Bank, has predicted that if
greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the ensuing climate change could
rip off 20 percent of the global GDP by 2050.
Every single business today, large or small, should be in the process of going
green. A whole bunch of carrots are available for those who do: The payoffs
can be very rewarding. On the other hand, there are plenty of big ugly sticks
poised to smack those who remain stubbornly entrenched in their old,
“brown” ways, and probably the biggest stick of all is the negative impact on
a company’s brand.

Understanding Why Your Company
Should Go Green
A 2006 Sierra Club poll showed that the proportion of Americans who worry
about the environment “a great deal” or “a fair amount” has jumped from
62 to 77 percent. Environmentalism, in other words, is on everyone’s radar.
As such, the choice for today’s companies doesn’t simply lie between the
extremes of the far-out tree hugger who chains himself to a redwood tree, on
the one hand, or, on the other, to falling into a bottomless abyss of paranoid
anxiety about impending lawsuits.
The speed with which information travels is another factor that is sobering
companies into going green. By the time a company finds out about an envi-
ronmental problem, the news about that problem may have already spread
around the world. Pick up a magazine or newspaper, and on any given day
you’re likely to see reports about green successes or failures. Green is news,
and news travels faster than ever.
Going green is literally everywhere. We could easily compare the current shift
toward enhanced environmental awareness to the events that resulted from
the dot.com boom of the early to mid-90s. Just as it was news then to have
a Web site, or even brochureware, so, too, is it news to be green now. Of
course, this won’t always hold true. Trends become fads, and fads eventually
become norms. For smart businesses, however — that is, for businesses that
go green proactively now — some nice press for being an environmental
pioneer is just one of the benefits.
The fact is, lots of companies used to go green because they had to, either by
law or as a last-ditch effort to improve their public image. Now, however,
those same companies have found that reducing pollutants and wasteful
practices also contributes to the increased efficiency of internal processes.
All of this — need we spell it out? — creates a positive impact on the bottom
line. Companies can profit substantially from going green!
Just listen to Sir Richard Branson, the mogul king sitting at the top of the
Virgin empire. “I believe we need to make a virtue out of investing in clean
technology and renewable energy,” he said in an interview for Saab’s Web
site (www.saabbiopower.co.uk/), “and not be ashamed to want to make
profits out of it. For too long, environmentally friendly technology and issues
about the environment have been seen as a corporate social responsibility
issue and not an opportunity to create new wealth in the future. Governments
alone cannot solve the problems we face unless the capitalist world invests in
a sustainable future.”
162
Part III: Going Green 

Profits aside, there are many, many reasons why your business needs to go
green. Here are five that even your kids will agree make sense. To go green is to
 Differentiate yourself from the competition
 Create major customer satisfaction
 Improve your reputation
 Meet and create demands for green products
 Do the right thing
In addition, creating green environments and green buildings provides lots of
benefits for lots of different groups of people. Here are just a few examples
of how going green benefits multiple parties, beyond just employees and
customers:
Local environments benefit from
 Greenhouse gas reduction
 Improved water quality
 Improved air quality
 Solid waste reduction
Organizations benefit from
 Lower waste disposal cost
 Safer and healthier working environments
 Reduced use of materials
 Unique marketing potential
Cities benefit from
 Enhancements to existing recycling programs for increased value
 Demonstrated environmental leadership
 Preservation of local quality of life
Owners and residents benefit from
 Lower utility bills
 Healthier/more productive living and working environments
 Reduced maintenance costs
 Increased resale value
 Preferential mortgages

Chapter 9: Making Your Company Environmentally Friendly

Going Green Is Good Business
A fantastic way to motivate yourself to go green fast is to examine the long
list of real-world benefits and rewards that your business is sure to reap the
moment you begin. Going green is not simply the right thing to do; it makes
good business sense too. In this section, you’ll learn how going green can
enhance your image, build trust with regulators, and influence the course of
life on Planet Earth (pretty heady stuff, that).
Enhance your image
From making your customers happy to building trust with regulatory authori-
ties, from reducing your risk exposures to nurturing the ecosystem, you can
find numerous ways to do the right thing while simultaneously improving
your company’s image. The next few sections outline several companies who
have gone green and detail some of the benefits they’ve reaped.
Consumers and shareholders alike never have been easily fooled, so they
know who is genuine and who is simply greenwashing (that is, appropriating
one or another environmental virtue for the sake of creating a false, pro-
environmental image). The evidence is there. People who live and work in
green environments are healthier and safer. Knowing as much, your customers
only want more, which is why they are the ones who sit behind the wheel of
the machine going green.
Hewlett Packard
As you can see from our list in the “Ten green giants” sidebar, HP isn’t the
only global manufacturer heeding the call to go green. It has experienced a
120 percent increase worldwide in the number of inquiries connected to the
environment since the last half of 2006. In 2005, the company received $6 bil-
lion in requests for proposals that had some environmental element. Pat
Tiernan, vice president for corporate social environmental responsibility, has
said that that number continues to climb.
As such, the company has taken the full lifecycle of products into account
when greening its supply chain. For example, they provide all of their part-
ners up- and downstream with a list of substances that are either hard on the
environment or entirely banned and then take measures to ensure that these
partners are adhering to respective laws. Bonnie Nixon Gardiner, global pro-
gram manager of supply chain social and environmental responsibility, says
this policy is “non-negotiable.”
Wal-Mart
Starting with toothpaste, milk, soap, soda, beer, DVDs, and vacuum cleaners,
Wal-Mart has begun working with suppliers to gauge and reduce the energy it
takes to manufacture, purchase, and distribute their products. In addition, the
164
Part III: Going Green 

company has pledged to encourage the rest of its suppliers to respond to
their new program. One means of doing this entails working more closely with
them, as well as with organizations such as the Carbon Disclosure Program.
The company’s Chief Merchandising Officer said, “This is an opportunity to
spur innovation and efficiency throughout our supply chain that will not only
help protect the environment but save people money at the same time.”
If other companies in the Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) industry can
implement likeminded energy-reduction policies, especially those businesses
with supply networks on the scale of Wal-Mart’s, proliferating efficiency stan-
dards and product innovation across multiple industries becomes an even
greater possibility.
Sun Microsystems
One of the ways that Sun has responded to the public clamor for a deepened
shade of green is to decrease the number of distribution centers in its supply
chain. To do this, it has simply increased the amount of finished product that
ships directly to customers. The resulting benefits are clear — less energy,
less plastic and paper, and less manpower. Savings from these cuts go towards
improving other green processes, such as, for example, the means by which
they disperse information to partners and customers. By using the Internet to
communicate, Sun has reduced paper costs from $10 million to $1 million and
saved two million pounds of paper each year. That’s nearly 6,000 trees still out
there converting carbon dioxide to oxygen for the rest of us!
Timberland
According to Gary Smith, Timberland’s senior vice president of global supply
chain, the outdoor clothing and shoe company has implemented a sustain-
ability agenda that accounts for the use of energy, materials, chemical, and
systems across its supply chain. Recently, for example, it installed a wind
tower at one of its sites. Elsewhere, it has implemented solar panels to heat
the water used to steam materials in its hand-sewn shoes. About one-third of
the company’s product line (over 10 million pairs of shoes) now incorporates
water-based adhesives. Just four years ago that number was nearly zero. It is
also taking measures to replace its polyvinyl chloride (PVC), a plastic consid-
ered detrimental to public health and the environment, with greener materi-
als by 2008.
DHL
DHL’s director of environmental strategies and policies, Winfried Haeser, says
the company sees reliance on fossil fuels and their damage to the environ-
ment as a challenge to be addressed on a global scale. One of the ways it has
reduced its resource expenditure was to ensure the highest possible loading
cycles are matched with the shortest possible distances traveled by its vehi-
cles, using internal optimization software to map out the best delivery routes.
Consequently, DHL has cut delivery mileage by 14 percent since 2001 and
added more than 20,000 tons of airfreight capacity without the need for addi-
tional flights. The company is also searching out alternative fuel technology,
165
Chapter 9: Making Your Company Environmentally Friendly

including bio-fuels and natural gas. According to current calculations, such
means could save several million euros per year by 2012 and cut greenhouse
gas emissions from its road vehicles to 5 percent below 1990 levels, a target
that is in line with provisions of the international Kyoto Protocol.
IBM
This techno monster has responded to customer demand by launching its
“Project Big Green.” The program commits $1 billion per year to increase the
level of energy efficiency in the information technologies markets. Since the
program’s birth, IBM has been more heavily bombarded by customer
requests than ever before.
Build trust with regulatory authorities
The maze of environmental regulations becomes more complex each day,
which in turn places a burden on regulatory agencies. As a result, regulators
place a high value on companies they can trust to do the right thing. Creating
a transparent audit trail and the means by which to access the wide range of
required documentation is a great way to build valuable goodwill with these
guys. Plus, it has been shown time and again that people like doing business
with companies they believe are on the up and up. When you comply with
environmental, employee, and consumer protection regulations of all kinds,
you are more likely to have a positive image in the public eye and in the
media. Provide full evidence of your compliance to all regulatory authorities,
and you can hardly lose.
Influence future events
If you don’t already know, you may be surprised to learn that mega-corporations
such as Xerox, Ford Motor Company, and Johnson & Johnson have joined
ranks with a host of powerful NGOs (non-governmental organizations) like
The Nature Conservancy and the National Wildlife Fund to become members
of the U.S. Climate Action Partnership (USCAP). If that’s not enough, they have
also requested that the U.S. government “quickly enact strong national legisla-
tion to require significant reductions of greenhouse gas emissions.” According
to their promo, they believe that addressing the “climate change challenge
will create more economic opportunities than risks for the U.S. economy.”
Many businesses are also signing up for programs like the California Climate
Registry Voluntary Program and the U.S. Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse
Gases Program. Companies in the former program voluntarily report their
CO2 emissions for the first year and then, after three years, their top six air
polluters, as well. Those businesses in the latter program — including utili-
ties such as Niagara Mohawk, Houston Lighting and Power, and New England
Electric Systems, manufacturers like General Motors and Alcan Ingot, coal
166
Part III: Going Green 

producers such as Consol and Peabody, chemical giants such as Dow and
DuPont, and IT innovators like IBM — report any activity that reduces emis-
sions of greenhouse gases or increases carbon fixation or sequestration.
Saving the planet, clearly, is not the only reason to take such a proactive stance
in the overall move to go green. Nor is the prospect of making a few more fast
bucks. What all these companies have in common is a vision of the possibility
that they get to help draft the very regulations they will soon need to oblige. In
other words, joining the go-green game early on can garner you a precious
advantage: that of receiving advance notification of future changes in the regu-
latory industry. Staying ahead of the game can enable companies to forecast
trends and influentially engage key people and agencies. Furthermore, they can
also meet and, frequently, beat regulations before enforcement policies are set.
What can this mean for you? While your competitors are rushing to catch up,
you will already be in the process of seeking out other ways to increase your
competitive advantage. With prospects like these, is it any wonder that USCAP
has pledged to “work with the President, the Congress, and all other stake-
holders” to enact a climate change program at the earliest possible date?
Implementing Green Practices
Just by planting trees, switching light bulbs, and filtering your water, you can
make a real difference in the environment. In the next few sections, we take a
look at a few practices your company can adopt to make going green easier.
Trees matter
More than 20 percent of the world’s oxygen is produced in the Amazon rain-
forest alone. And yet since 1992, the number of rainforest acres has dropped
by 50 percent. Ponder this for about a millisecond and you can see why
businesses everywhere have begun to engage in tree plantings. Accor North
America, for example, is planting 20,000 trees throughout the United States
and Canada — one for each of its employees. Another such philanthropic
company is Milliken Contract; since launching Trees for All on Arbor Day
2006, Milliken customers have added about 8,000 trees of renewed forests
through their online program. 
Let there be (green) light!
If every American home replaced just one old light bulb with a compact fluo-
rescent lamp (CFL) bulb, the country would save enough energy to light more
than 3 million homes for a year, more than $600 million in annual energy
167
Chapter 9: Making Your Company Environmentally Friendly

costs, and prevent greenhouse gases equivalent to the emissions of more
than 800,000 cars. Imagine what the numbers would be if businesses began to
use these bulbs across their entire operations.
Here are some of the advantages of CFL (ENERGY STAR) bulbs:
 Use about 75 percent less energy than standard incandescent bulbs and
last up to 10 times longer
 Save about $30 or more in electricity costs over each bulb’s lifetime
 Produce about 75 percent less heat, so they’re safer to operate and can
cut energy costs associated with home cooling
Water: To bottle or not to bottle?
Some companies provide bottled water for their employees. This seemingly
healthy choice is actually very negative for the environment. A 2001 report
by the World Wide Fund for Nature estimates that approximately 1.5 million
tons of plastic are wasted in the bottling of 89 billion liters of water each year.
Notwithstanding the plastic itself, the energy needed to make and deliver
these bottles to market depletes limited fossil fuels. Due to their unregulated
use of resources and their production of billions of plastic bottles, bottled
water companies are creating a real strain on the environment.
For individuals and businesses alike, the alternative to consuming bottled
water is to use local water treated and purified with your own systems. The
three most common methods of water purification are reverse osmosis, dis-
tillation, and water filtration. By offering employees filtered water instead of
water bottles, you and the environment both win, again.
Reduce your risk
A vital part of going green involves continually tracking your key perfor-
mance indicators and compliance with internal and external regulations to
ensure that you are not breaking any laws. Such practices enable you to
manage risk in a way that minimizes everyone’s bad dream of costly fines or
forced shutdowns. And the trend of adding C-suite jobs with titles like Chief
Compliance Officer and Chief Sustainability Officer further reinforces the
need for “owners” to be responsible for managing these risks. The company’s
success depends on it. Of course, your key stakeholders will love you all the
more, too, when you are on top of your GRC because you’ll have the report-
ing and collaborative capabilities that enable you to communicate with them
on a regular, timely basis.
168
Part III: Going Green 

Going Green Is also the Law
No one goes into business these days jumping for joy at the idea of complying
with the laws in highly regulated industries. But facts, as they say, are facts.
Environmental compliance regulations are not merely here to stay: They are
growing exponentially. The current list includes such gems as ISO 14001, EPA
Clean Air Act Title V, EPA Clean Water Act, EU Emission Trading Scheme (ETS),
US SARA 313 and Canadian NPRI Reporting, Health & Safety Management
(OHSA 18001, COSHH), Social Accountability (SA 8000), Risk Management
(AS/NZS 4360), and Information Security (BS/ ISO 17799). And these are the
“minor” ones! For a clearer view of the whole regulatory picture, read on.
Compliance
Are you a manufacturer of lingerie? Do you produce house paint? Are golf
balls the bread and butter in your company’s refrigerator? How often does
your motherboard factory send waste material off to the county landfill site?
Each and every one of today’s businesses, no matter whether you are the
man on the corner selling hot dogs or the leading builder of jet fighter tur-
bines, absolutely, positively, without a solitary doubt must comply with
today’s environmental regulations, standards, directives, and laws, of which
there are many. They don’t call it “the long arm of the law” for nothing.
For better or worse, your operations affect consumer health, employee
safety, and, just as importantly, the environment, which is why our current
environmental compliance requirements in all their massive scope and com-
plexity make the Sarbanes-Oxley Act look like a legislative midget. The
American Chemistry Council, for example, estimates in its “Guide to the
Business of Chemistry, 2005” that 3.4 percent of the industry’s total revenue
is spent on environmental health and safety. The bulk is directed toward capi-
tal equipment and remediation, but substantial expenditures are also handed
to the consultants needed to help you comply. This is to say nothing of the
technology you must implement if you want to stay on top of the game.
To the uninitiated, the notion of compliance can seem as abstract as the
theory of relativity. Fear not, however. It can be complicated, just not that
complicated. Although the requirements themselves may be, their subjects
are not. Simply put, they are the three Ps we mentioned earlier: your com-
pany’s people, processes, and products. When your business is compliant,
it is managing its plants and manufacturing processes in such a way that
your equipment, personnel, storage and distribution facilities, and products
are not creating any damage as defined by the environmental and exposure
specifications associated with current law. Simple, huh?
169
Chapter 9: Making Your Company Environmentally Friendly

Well, sort of. You’ve also got to manage the levels of emissions and waste cre-
ated across the full lifecycle of your operations, from R&D through delivery
to the marketplace. And then of course your product has a half-life, and a full
one, too, at whose end it must be properly disposed of. You are frequently
held accountable for managing these, as well. Love them or hate them, they
are not going away. The sooner your business takes them into account, the
better off you are likely to be.
Risks of noncompliance: Fines and
public relations nightmares
The consequences of noncompliance range anywhere from token slaps on
the wrist to prison sentences for top executives to the loss of a company’s
goodwill to the forced closure of your business and consequent financial col-
lapse. Recently, the most notable examples of trouble that can befall erring
companies concern the disastrous events surrounding the toy giant Mattel.
170

Environmental health and safety in the modern
world: Complexity and compliance
Managing environmental issues is complicated
today and only becoming more so. Companies
are paying more attention than ever to this area
because of pressure from the following forces,
both internal and external to the company:
 Advent of numerous rigid environmental
regulations
 Registration, Evaluation, and Authorization
of Chemicals (REACH)
 Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment

Here’s what happened around the world when The New York Times began
revealing that the Chinese manufactures to whom Mattel outsources much of
its work used lead paint in their toys:
 June 15, 2007: 1 million piece recall of the toy Thomas & Friends begins.
 June 19, 2007: Eric S. Lipton and David Barboza begin a series of stories
on lead paint hazards in Chinese-made toys.
 August 2, 2007: US Consumer Product Safety Commission begins recall
of Fisher-Price character toys for lead paint hazard.
 August 14, 2007: Mattel’s total recall approaches 18.7 million toys.
The aluminum maker Alcoa was hurt so badly in a recent scandal that it is
close to selling both its packaging and consumer business, along with its auto-
motive castings business, and has plans to restructure its electrical and elec-
tronic solutions business in the Americas and Europe. Kahoot Products Inc.,
the maker of the plastic totem badges used by the Boy Scouts of America, had
to recall 1.6 million badges, which are made in China. Is it any wonder that
environmentally attributable childhood diseases, including asthma, lead poi-
soning, and cancer, cost the U.S. as a whole nearly $55 billion annually?
Obviously this problem is huge. The resulting flak has given all these compa-
nies — and Chinese manufacturers on the whole — a considerable black eye.
The problem, however, is not merely an environmental one. Employees are
involved because the materials they are handling are potentially toxic and
the consumers who purchased the faulty products stand to be victimized, as
well. This is to say nothing of the incredible fall that the brand owner takes,
which in turn can have possibly disastrous consequences on the world econ-
omy; if things go badly enough, ripples can be seen around the globe. And
even if no one is hurt, the entire toy industry is itself now poisoned by one of
the greatest bugaboos of all — bad faith. Ask Union Carbide about bad faith;
after killing 3,000 in Bhopal, India, they are one of the most abhorred compa-
nies in the world. Ask Exxon, too, a company that has scarcely been able to
clear its name nearly 20 years after the Valdez oil spill! No doubt many com-
panies bounce back from bad press, but is this a risk that you, your PR team,
and your stockholders want to take? It’s definitely something to consider.
A Final Word About Going Green
By now it should be abundantly clear that environmental health and safety is
here to stay. Your plans for going green, therefore, should be a line item on
your budget this month, not a few years down the road. Do not underestimate
171
Chapter 9: Making Your Company Environmentally Friendly

the nature and extent of the changes, either: the solutions required to accom-
plish this transition are not mutually exclusive to one or two of your depart-
ments or processes. Rather, you should anticipate implementing green
methodologies across the entirety of your corporate ecosystem, top to
bottom and side to side.
To do so, you want to consider the following matters:
 Protecting your employees, customers, and neighbors
 Reducing risks of occupational incidents and unauthorized releases of
substances
 Preserving and, whenever possible, enhancing the environment
 Developing and installing a single, integrated platform that enables you
to effectively monitor your GRC and environmental health and safety
processes
 Complying with a burgeoning complex of regulations
 Improving your company’s overall flexibility and transparency 
 Providing near real-time reporting to all regulatory agencies
With more than 250 new environmental directives and standards around the
world in 2006 alone, it is critical that your business deploy more open stan-
dards, flexible communications, and compliance support. The more you do,
and the faster you do it, the more easily you can reach across multiple envi-
ronmental regulations and regional variations, and the more manufacturers,
dealers, suppliers, customers, and regulatory authorities will want to work
with you. At the end of the day, you will all be benefiting the environment and
each other, and you will be doing it while speaking the same green language.

Keeping Employees
Healthy and Safe
In This Chapter
 Keeping employees safe
 Striving for zero accidents
 Taking the SAP approach to employee health and safety
Just as your first priority is to maintain the soundness of your own mind and
body, so too should your company’s first order of business be to ensure
that the people in it are always healthy and safe. After all, it stands to reason:
Your people are the lifeblood of your business — literally. Injured or sick
employees present the unwelcome specter of misery and loss; recent estimates
put the costs associated with occupational injuries and illness near $170 bil-
lion: costs that are not receiving the support of government subsidies but are
simply draining your company’s coffers. Healthy people, on the other hand, are
happy people, and happy people make productive, happy businesses. At the
end of the day, it’s as simple as understanding that the shin-bone is connected
to the knee-bone.
The mere thought that your company could be a major contributor to 
the astronomical costs associated with yearly occupational injuries and
illnesses — again, the number is quickly rising toward the $200 billion mark —
should be enough to send you and your top team members running to the
board room for an emergency summit on how to design and institute a health
and safety program comprehensive enough to protect the well-being of your
employees, vendors, contractors, and visitors.
Perhaps you have already begun. If so, our hats are off. If, however, you have
not begun, but are about to or if you are faced with islands of nonintegrated
information, it’s important that you first consider a variety of critical factors.
As you know, the success of your business ultimately depends on how happy
you keep your employees. Your employees’ happiness, on the other hand, is
really dependent on the extent to which your health and safety agenda
includes managing their commitment and involvement, and providing them
with training that meets industry-wide certification standards. You also need

to create structured methods to analyze your worksites in ways that enable
you to accurately assess potential risks and then develop the means to pre-
vent and control hazards.
In this chapter, we cover the basics of safety, including implementing a safety
plan, minimizing accidents, and educating employees. We also look at some
of the many benefits of improved safety, including lowered healthcare costs
and better employee recruitment and hiring.
Keeping Your Employees Safe and
Healthy: The Big Picture
The ramifications of a health and safety plan are as extensive as they are
positive. When you take planned, verifiable measures to implement a health
and safety program that manages employee commitment and involvement,
worksite analysis, hazard prevention and control, and certified training for
all employees — from your ground-level workers right on up to your C-level
hotshots — you can create a virtually foolproof program for success.
Have a look at the potential benefits. In addition to increasing the morale and
productivity of your people, your business’s turnover will decrease even as
the quality of your product improves. Plus, you can almost certainly count on
enhanced labor and management relations, along with an overall improve-
ment in the use of your human resources.
Happy, healthy, whole employees translate to lower workers’ compensation
insurance costs, reduced medical expenditures, smaller expenditures for
return-to-work programs, and fewer faulty products. You spend less paying
for job accommodations for injured workers, and you also spend less for the
overtime benefits that are sure to accrue when your healthy people have to
step in for those who are not.
Both your employees themselves and their families benefit from your health
and safety program, too. Staying healthy guarantees that their incomes are
protected and their family lives are free of the discontent that would be sure
to result from the anxiety and stress brought on by injury or illness.
In short, caring for and protecting people in your workplace makes them feel
a part of the whole, a part of the world around them, so that when at last you
are ready to create a unified strategy committed to environmental responsi-
bility in every sector of the company’s ecosystem, your employees will waste
no time jumping on board the GRC wagon. The well-being of employees is
good for everyone and everything — our businesses, our fellow workers, our
families, our communities, and our economy.
174
Part III: Going Green 

Enabling and maintaining good health
Unless your employees maintain optimum health, they cannot perform at the
high levels required to create superior products. To ensure their good health,
your business should consider initiating a healthcare management program
that includes
 A health center with qualified staff able to access vital information on
demand; such data ought to entail personal information, case histories,
injury and illness records, medical measures, restrictions, vaccinations,
and the like; staff should be able to quickly and easily evaluate medical
parameters, review general health statistics, display personal exposure
record information, and provide statistics needed by workers’ compen-
sation associations
 Health surveillance protocols appropriate to each employee’s personal
exposure situation. As a means of reducing lost work hours, maximizing
health center facility operations, and cutting company costs; all unnec-
essary protocols should be eliminated
 Physicians armed with statistics that enable them to recognize potential
sources of danger, avoid occupational diseases, conduct occupational
epidemiology studies, and provide evidence to any concerned persons
or agencies that specified treatments and services have been rendered
 First-aid training for specified individuals, along with an accurate, regu-
larly updated list of who has received such training and where in the
company they are located
Avoiding accidents
People make mistakes, disaster strikes, fires start, chemicals spill, and fork-
lifts go out of control. What we call accidents are almost always preventable
(well, except for the natural disasters), and sometimes despite our efforts at
prevention, they do occur. Certainly some industries have more inherent
risks to the safety of their employees than others, particularly those involv-
ing mining, chemicals, construction, lumber, maritime activities, and manu-
facturing. Regardless of how comparatively safe or dangerous your industry
is, safety risks are a concern for every company doing business today.
Your organization can take its first steps toward building a strong health and
safety agenda simply by engaging in some good old-fashioned common sense,
and then by applying universally recognized prevention principles. Foremost
among these principles is an employee-training program that addresses the
specific needs and requirements of your industry and a comprehensive
system to manage all of this.
175
Chapter 10: Keeping Employees Healthy and Safe

Information goes a long way toward combating the sort of ignorance or lack
of awareness that is responsible for the majority of occupational injuries.
Moreover, educating your people constitutes the foundation of the culture
change that needs to transpire in your organization if its employees are to
successfully participate in the transformation from a business that is brown,
or yellow, or even pale green to one that is decidedly emerald-colored in
terms of its environmental friendliness (more on this in Chapter 11).
Here is a list of procedures we suggest you follow to begin a program struc-
tured to help minimize employee risks:
 Establish safety committees. Committee members may include facility
managers or administrators, various department heads, and employee
representatives. The main goal of the committee is to assess all
employee safety risks at the facility, keeping an eye on the most
common areas of employee exposure to harm. After risks are identified,
the committee can determine how to reduce those risks. 
 Encourage employee involvement and safety awareness. Safety com-
mittees ought to encourage employees to actively participate in making
decisions that affect them. You can talk to them about what problems
they encounter in performing their duties that could contribute to injury.
You can also solicit their suggestions. To promote further employee
awareness, you may consider introducing a safety education program.
 Reward safe work practices. Developing an incentive program can help
to motivate employees to more effectively follow workplace safety prac-
tices. The program might reward teams whose efforts result in a reduc-
tion of on-the-job injuries, or better yet, zero-based injury periods. Pick a
perk, any perk. You may be surprised at how far these sorts of things
can go to make people happy. You can also establish an employee safety
goal each year for your facility, which can be expressed, for instance, as
a target number of workers’ compensation claims that are benchmarked
against the average number from prior years.
Healthy benefits equal employee
recruitment retention
Employees are your most valuable assets. In addition to focusing on their
health and safety, rewarding them with additional benefits demonstrates the
depth of your commitment to their well-being. Needless to say, strong bene-
fits also make it easier to recruit and retain talented employees.
Health care, paid time off, and retirement plans are the most common types
of benefits employees receive, but some companies are increasingly offering
more types of benefits intended both to improve the quality of life of their
176
Part III: Going Green 

current employees while simultaneously attracting the best possible candi-
dates for new positions. Of course, these efforts also translate to enhanced
morale and improved job performance.
For example, your company might offer tuition reimbursement for those
employees who want to further their education while working. Your company
might also consider creating daycare facilities in the workplace. To compen-
sate employees who don’t have kids, you can initiate a cafeteria plan. Under
this umbrella, each employee is given a set allowance that can be used
toward any benefit they choose. This way, they can pick the options from
which they will receive the most benefit.
Other benefits provided by some employers include gym facilities to allow
employees to fit exercise into their busy schedules, onsite massage therapy,
cafeterias that sell reduced price meals to working employees, and onsite
laundry services — all using organic foods, beverages, products, and supplies. 
Lastly, flexible work plans are another type of benefit that has a proven posi-
tive influence on employee productivity, attendance, and morale. Flexible
work plans allow your employees to adjust their working conditions within
constraints set by the company and may include such options as flex-time,
compressed work weeks, job sharing, and home-based work.
Moving Down the Road to Zero Accidents
Many companies across a spectrum of industries and sectors are no longer
content to keep their occupational accident count to a mere minimum. Instead,
in a movement motivated by the goal of having zero accidents, they are taking
aggressive steps to eliminate them altogether. The ultimate goal of such an
agenda is zero accidents, injuries, or illnesses, and zero environmental harm. 
Organizing and managing a comprehen-
sive health and safety program
To build a health and safety program that is as successful as it is comprehen-
sive, you first need to identify and activate a central point of focus around
which the rest of the components in your program can revolve. Regardless of
the industry you do business in, whether it is retail, oil and gas, or discrete
manufacturing, the perfect place to start is the place where your employees
execute their actual work. From the workplace, you can evaluate and manage
your risk assessments, review your incidents, and evaluate your work proce-
dures. (Risk assessments are invaluable, providing you with tools for detailed
analysis and documentation of the risks in each workplace.) In addition, your
workplace scenario provides a springboard from which to generate statistics
177
Chapter 10: Keeping Employees Healthy and Safe

and create accident and near-miss reports, and update the company accident
record. Finally, the workplace is an optimal place from which to organize, per-
form, and evaluate both site inspections and health and safety briefings.
Yet another protocol that you can establish around the workplace to help
meet your health and safety objectives pertains to exposure summaries.
Creating a summary for each workplace enables you to see an overview of
every employee and thus more easily assess their performance on the basis
of predetermined timeframes. Later, when you compare individual summaries
with your risk assessments, you’ll be able to more clearly see the strengths
and weaknesses of your agenda and make any needed adjustments. For exam-
ple, having ascertained that one of your workplaces stands in jeopardy of an
accident due to high levels of employee exposure to hazardous substances,
you can now introduce the safety measures needed to establish or guarantee
the safety of your people. The sorts of patterns that were once obscure now
become discernible as a result of the regular documentation provided by
your exposure summaries.
The next key step here is to figure out how you can use technology to help
you manage incidents and stay organized. Automation can reap many bene-
fits and can help you identify patterns of risk that may be undetectable using
manual processes. Furthermore, in addition to implementing software that
can help you track and ultimately greatly reduce incidents and accidents,
your company should have an easy-to-use interface or e-mail-based form that
makes it easy for all employees to enter near-misses. Tracking these near-
misses closely can help you reduce accidents even further. 
Assessing risks
Unless you have mechanisms in place to regularly assess the risks inherent
to your operations, you stand little chance of developing improvements to
your overall health and safety program. The processes involved in releasing
hazardous substances and materials, taking control measurements, following
accidents or near-misses, executing preventive monitoring are all classic
opportunities to assess risks.
Any number of methods can be deployed to do this. You can begin with the
oldest trick in the book; that is, by using observation. Actually watching how
people work to pick up the little details that contribute to an overall pattern
of behavior can produce amazing results. The more ways you can discover to
prevent accidents — much less near misses — the better off you and your
employees will be in the long run.
In addition to the various observation techniques you implement, you can
also compare measured values and reference values, and you can evaluate
questionnaires. When a risk cannot be quantified by measurements, you can
178
Part III: Going Green 

contrast standardized criteria, such as laws or other sources. Protection
goals and safety measures for a given risk can then be defined and assessed
yet again to determine their level of success.
After you have measured your data, it is important that you process and
effectively manage it. It is equally vital that all of the steps and tasks required
to define, perform, evaluate, and document your measurements are taken
into account, as well. Creating an exposure record is a great way to systemati-
cally record the risks in your work places, including hazardous substances,
noise, climate, and lighting, all at the same time. You can also update the
exposure record automatically to create a hazardous-substance inventory to
meet legal requirements. As changes to your exposure record accrue, you will
have a complete history available at any time.
By evaluating the relationships between employees and various assessed risks,
you can propose accurate health-surveillance protocols for each employee,
derived from his or her personal exposure. Such a measure will also result in
reduced healthcare costs; unnecessary employee health-surveillance protocols
are effectively eliminated, thus reducing visits to the doctor.
Standardizing your procedures
Critical to the success of your health and safety program is the establishment
of clear standard operating procedures for handling and working with haz-
ardous substances (more about this in Chapter 12), machines, and installa-
tions, or for performing tasks that are potentially dangerous. Two types of
standard operation procedures ought to be in effect at all times. The first type
guides individual procedures; the second provides boundaries for groups of
employees.
Laws such as the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) in the United States,
the hazardous-substance directive in Germany, and other, similar EU legisla-
tion, require that standard operating procedures for handling hazardous sub-
stances contain certain information, including definitions and descriptions of
 Workplace and tasks
 Hazardous substances 
 Dangers to humans and the environment
 Protective measures and rules of conduct
 Behavior in dangerous situations
 First aid
 Waste disposal measures
179
Chapter 10: Keeping Employees Healthy and Safe

Managing accidents
Beyond your company’s obligation to guarantee the well-being of your
workers, you want to reduce your accident count to a minimum — preferably
zero — if only because doing so reduces costs. As a result, your concern with
accident statistics and their analysis is crucial. Not only do you need to
record and report accidents that have happened, but you also must account
for every near miss — episodes in which no one was harmed, but could have
been. And when you analyze data for both accidents and near misses, you
can produce more effective and informative accident reports.
180
Part III: Going Green 
OSHA
The goal of folks over at the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration (OSHA) is to ensure
the safety and health of employees in the United
States by working with them and their employers
to create better working environments.
According to their statistics, in 2005 there were
4.2 million occupational injuries and illnesses
among U.S. employees. Breaking it down,
approximately 4.6 of every 100 employees expe-
rienced a job-related injury or illness, and in
2006, 5,703 employees lost their lives on the job.
Clearly, it’s a good thing we have these guys
around: Believe it or not, they have made a dif-
ference! Over four million injuries and nearly
6,000 deaths may seem like a lot, but it could have
been much, much worse. Since its inception in
1971, OSHA has helped to cut workplace fatalities
by more than 60 percent and occupational injury
and illness rates by 40 percent. At the same time,
U.S. employment has increased from 56 million
employees at 3.5 million worksites to more than
135 million employees at 8.9 million sites.
OSHA’s top priority is getting reports of imminent
dangers. Second on the list are fatalities or acci-
dents serious enough to send three or more
employees to the hospital. The third-level priority
derives from employee complaints, while refer-
rals from other government agencies come
fourth. Fifth are targeted inspections, such as the
Site Specific Targeting Program, which focuses
on employers that report high injury and illness
rates, along with special emphasis programs that
zero in on hazardous work and equipment.
Follow-up inspections are the final priority.
OSHA has the last word concerning health and
safety laws of the land. From Dow Chemical,
DHL, and UPS to AAA, Martinizing Dry Cleaning,
and the local mom-and-pop news stand, all
businesses great and small must comply with
the legislation over which OSHA presides. If you
don’t play by the rules, you’re liable to get hurt.
OSHA cuffs violators with penalties ranging up
to $70,000, depending on how likely the violation
is to result in serious harm to employees.
One of these rules concerns employee rights.
Every business owner must post a federal or
state OSHA poster to provide their employees
with information about their safety and health
rights. To speak with a compliance assistance
specialist about training and education in job
safety and health issues, you can contact the
OSHA office nearest you. OSHA also provides
businesses with an interactive training applica-
tion that “walks” users through specific OSHA
standards and helps them to identify potential
hazards throughout a given workplace. You can
also find information on specific topics by visit-
ing the OSHA Web site (www.osha.gov).

Managing your accidents and near misses and creating legally compliant
reports for them begins with an accident record. Enter data about accidents
and near misses and the people who experienced or witnessed them. In addi-
tion to the information that is legally required for your reports, you may
also want to enter data for your own company-specific accident recording
policies.
Inspecting your sites and creating
new safety measures
Another key role in effective health and safety programs is filled by site
inspections. Among the numerous rewards they bestow upon the smart
people who execute them is the ability to ensure that their employees
are adhering to established health and safety rules and regulations,
both legal and private, and to maintain safety technology and health
protection standards. Of course, inspections also serve to emphasize
the importance of such standards to employees in every corner of your
corporate landscape.
The data you need to plan and perform a site inspection should be available
as a consequence of the activity in the areas where actual work is performed,
and of your risk assessments, too. When a risk is noted during an inspection,
you need to implement and track measures to reduce or eliminate it.
Typically such measures fall into three categories: 
 Technical measures, such as maintenance orders
 Organizational measures, such as physically separating persons and haz-
ards or using timed access
 Person-related measures, such as holding safety briefings
Storing information about various safety measures is a good idea, including
 Responsible parties
 Priorities for mitigating risks
 Planned, execution, and check dates
You should be able to produce and review the safety measures implemented
following a site inspection at any time.
181
Chapter 10: Keeping Employees Healthy and Safe

Educating your employees
Laws and regulations in all sectors insist that companies train their employ-
ees in the basics of workplace safety. Depending on your industry, employees
may need to learn how to handle hazardous substances or operate heavy
machinery and dangerous electrical appliances. Whatever the case, health
and safety briefings also teach them about the risks they encounter on the
job and the measures that are required to avoid them. Typical briefings teach
employees about current industrial hygiene and safety and accident-prevention
regulations, too.
Accident prevention briefings nearly always take precedent, however, touch-
ing on technical and organizational safety measures, such as installing pro-
tective grids or establishing fully enclosed systems, may be included.
Because many accidents result from people behaving in a way that isn’t safe,
safety education is a key to preventing them. 
182
Part III: Going Green 
OSHA, by any other name, around the world
Most first-world countries have a framework of
health and safety law that is backed by a means
of enforcement. In addition, people injured as a
result of their work generally have the right to
sue their employers in the civil courts for negli-
gently causing such injury.
Almost all countries have their own legislation,
frequently within widely differing court systems.
The British, for example, have the Health and
Safety at Work Act of 1974 (it is set, however, in
the context of the European Union, whose laws
take priority over those of the member states).
Here are a few of the Act’s requirements (those
in other countries are similar, give or take dif-
ferences here and there). Under this Act,
employers must:
 Provide a healthy and safe workplace
 Take reasonable precautions for the safety
of themselves and of others (including, of
course, contractors, visitors, and paying
customers)
 Prevent onsite operators from emitting toxic
substances into the general atmosphere
 Ensure that their products are reasonably
safe, and provide information on safety pre-
cautions to be taken in their use
 Allow for the appointment of trade union
or employee safety representatives and
set up safety committees, if requested by
representatives

Making the Case for Automation
and Integration
In all likelihood, your company’s operations are vast. Your organization’s
footprint includes a supply chain that begins with human relations and runs
out to cover the logistics inherent to all your plant operations, wherever they
may be in the world, and the timely shipping of your product to a demanding
market. If you haven’t reached this stage yet, you are headed in that direc-
tion. Either way, you need to ensure the health and safety of every single one
of your employees, vendors, contractors, and visitors. Moreover, the reports
you produce must be directed not only to your C-suite, but also to various
other employees, the public, the government, and a plethora of local agen-
cies, all according to rigid schedules.
Called upon to create such accountability using stand-alone means and appli-
cations or, worse, manual techniques, you would quickly succumb to a quag-
mire of logistic complications and bureaucratic difficulties, thus obstructing
your ability to function as a business. You must change your methods to
meet the demands of the times, and you must do it in a way that enables you
to continue growing.
To implement your occupational health and industrial hygiene and safety
programs such that they are comprehensive, the means by which you acti-
vate and manage them should work in concert, focused to achieve a single,
clearly articulated goal. In the end, any aspect of this program that is stand-
alone is more likely to function as an obstacle to your ends than as a support.
When you integrate, you can
 Access all existing data (human resource business processes, plant
maintenance, and materials management, among others) from a single
location to see a wider picture
 Improve cooperation among different departments and enhance the flow
of information
 Update dependent data instantly. Changes to hazardous-substance
data, for instance, can result in generation of new standard operating
procedures
 Track and control safety measures automatically 
 Expand your range of reporting options. Extract data from industrial
hygiene and safety, occupational health, HR, and logistics 
 Complete documentation of all processes. Accident management, health
and safety briefings, and health-surveillance protocols can all be man-
aged from one location
 Achieve global standardization of procedures and documentation
183
Chapter 10: Keeping Employees Healthy and Safe

Remember, your aim is not simply to lower accident counts, but to achieve
total prevention. By seamlessly integrating your data, your processes, and
your people, you guarantee better safety for your workforce while simultane-
ously decreasing their stress. Just as importantly, because you can comply
more easily with both current and forthcoming employee health and safety
laws and policies, you create deeper public trust. You also save substantially
on healthcare costs to boot.
Taking the SAP Approach to Employee
Health and Safety
SAP offers enterprise-class software to help companies organize and control
their efforts around employee health and safety through two modules of SAP
EH&S: Occupational Health and Industrial Hygiene and Safety.
The Occupational Health module
The functionality included in the Occupational Health module streamlines
and improves the standard processes required to manage the well-being of
your company’s employees. In addition, it helps forge the way for implement-
ing a full-scale healthcare management program throughout your enterprise,
all of whose processes protect data, uphold medical confidentiality, and con-
sider current legal requirements.
The Occupational Health module offers the following advantages:
 Automatic assignment of protocols based on actual employee exposure
and tasks
 Automatic monitoring of protocol frequencies
 Elimination of superfluous examinations, which saves time and money
for your occupational health department, your employees, and your
company as a whole
 Access to all relevant industrial hygiene and safety information
 Active participation of the occupational health department in risk
assessments, site inspections, and decisions to release hazardous sub-
stances and materials for public and private use
 Minimization or elimination of the need to edit HR data
 Appointment scheduling based on current time management data
 Documentation of all processes in compliance with current law
184
Part III: Going Green 

 Standardization of data entry
 Flexible reporting based on validated data
 User-specific combining of necessary functions
 Worldwide deployment in a range of languages
Because Occupational Health integrates with the entire SAP landscape, all of
your departments can benefit from its functionality. For example, the solution
enables you to ensure that each employee receives the health surveillance
protocols appropriate to his personal exposure situation. As a result, you
eliminate those health surveillance protocols that are unnecessary, maximize
use of your health center facility, and increase the time your employees spend
on more productive activities. Because your company can actively pursue pre-
ventive health management with minimal staff and administrative effort, you
gain the further advantage of reducing your company’s overall costs.
A final integration benefit of deploying SAP Occupational Health lies in the way
it uses information already entered in the industrial hygiene and safety func-
tion of SAP Environment, Health & Safety (SAP EH&S) as well as in the HR man-
agement function of SAP ERP Human Capital Management (SAP ERP HCM).
Data pulled from these systems can be triangulated to provide a total view into
protocols, employees, and associated risks. This automation provides new effi-
ciencies for organizations and most definitely impacts the bottom line.
The Industrial Hygiene and Safety module
Just as the functionality included in Occupational Health streamlines and
improves the standard processes required to manage the well-being of your
company’s employees, so too does the functionality in the Industrial Hygiene
and Safety module of SAP EH&S. When your company deploys it, you can
easily gather accumulated data from the processes you follow to manage
your industrial hygiene and safety programs and receive optimal support in
making critical decisions. The resulting foresight you gain takes you further
down the path toward zero accidents and total prevention.
In the next few sections, we outline the critical concerns that the Industrial
Hygiene and Safety addresses.
Risk assessment
Using Industrial Hygiene and Safety, you can
 Build process flows, track resources, and deploy automated question-

Chapter 10: Keeping Employees Healthy and Safe

 Employ summated ratings for mixed substances based on hazardous
substances found in your workplaces, or based on compositions speci-
fied in the SAP EH&S substance database and calculation of indexes.
 Create hazardous substance inventories to meet legal requirements by
establishing exposure records and updating them automatically. Ensure
that hazardous-substance information and agent-specific information is
stored and edited at one place only in your enterprise.
 Implement multilevel release processes before introducing hazardous
substances or materials. If the use of substances or materials are not
approved for entire enterprises, specific plants, or individual work-
places, set according locks.
Standard operating procedures
Industrial Hygiene and Safety provides support for standard operating
procedures:
 Establish the right procedures to avoid any hazard. The content of each
standard operating procedure is created from existing data. If any data
that is marked as relevant — such as reference values or protective
measures — is changed in the hazardous-substance database, the soft-
ware creates new standard operating procedures automatically.
 Integrate procedures into existing report-generation and report-
management functions of SAP EH&S to receive full status management
and versioning of documents, as well as to import external documents
into the application.
 Create standard operating procedures in any language by working with
phrases, for example reusable text modules that you can translate into
all the languages installed with the software. Build standard operating
procedures for each workplace in all languages spoken by your employ-
ees (as required by law).
Accident management
Accident management is of course a key feature and the following high-
lights some of the ways Industrial Hygiene and Safety supports accident
management:
 Create accident records to enter data for any type of accident or near-
miss, defining general and specific fields via the SAP classification system.
 Generate accident reports at the push of a button, and dispatch them
via your choice of mail, fax, or e-mail.
 Record accident causes in standardized formats. Use root cause hierar-
chies proposed by workers’ compensation associations, or enter your
own causes.
186
Part III: Going Green 

The following options are available for the statistical evaluation of accident
data and the analysis of areas where there is a high concentration of
accidents:
 Evaluations directly in SAP software, such as the 1000-employee quota
or the one-million-hour quota
 Transfer accident data to SAP NetWeaver Business Intelligence or exter-
nal statistics programs, allowing flexible evaluations that take other
information into account, for example, from SAP ERP Human Capital
Management (HCM)
 Transfer data from injury and illness records to accident management
records; first-aid centers and accident administration can work together
more effectively; duplicate data entry is eliminated
Site inspections
Industrial Hygiene and Safety provides support for site inspections. You can
 Create a site inspection using data stored in your risk assessment tools
and work-area related objects. Use the questionnaire function to create
checklists for recording detailed results in detail.
 Use the full functionality of SAP ERP’s Plant Maintenance, Quality
Management, and Customer Service components to create and process
notifications via the industrial hygiene and safety measure tool. For
example, you can create a maintenance notification — complete with the
safety measures to be carried out — and transfer these tasks to Plant
Maintenance for further action, while tracking their progress in Plant
Maintenance from Industrial Hygiene and Safety. When all tasks have
been completed, you will be notified in your Business Workplace inbox.
In the final step, simply assess the result.
 Extract all costs incurred for processing industrial hygiene and safety
measures developed after site inspections from the software and use
them to calculate total amounts. An overview of costs to implement
safety measures is available at any time. If any of the cost details are
missing, you can add it manually.
 Review safety measures implemented following site inspections, along
with their results, at any time. Use these measures for documentation
and evaluation purposes.
 Know what you must report and when. Manage reporting calculations
and use predefined templates to transform composite data and generate
agency-approved reports.

Chapter 10: Keeping Employees Healthy and Safe

Safety briefing and worker qualification
With SAP Industrial Hygiene and Safety, you can access the training and event
management functions in SAP ERP HCM to manage health and safety brief-
ings. Account for those employees who have received new training as well as
those who require a refreshment course. Detect shortcomings in employee
health and safety knowledge by comparing their skills sets to those required
to perform respective tasks. Determine where employees can safely work,
along with the machinery they can operate without danger to themselves and
others, by regularly assessing their qualifications. Store results of employee
training in your employee master data. Because many health and safety brief-
ings are valid only for a limited period of time, SAP Industrial Hygiene and
Safety automatically proposes repeat sessions.

Making Your Business Processes
Environmentally Friendly
In This Chapter
 Keeping up with innovative green building practices
 Assessing your environmental risks
 Discovering the special environmental challenges of manufacturers
A
ll businesses have processes, the day to day work that gets the job done.
These processes can be proactive about protecting the environment, or
they can keep up the status quo. Energy use, site selection, green building,
and recycling are some of the issues that affect all companies. Some companies
have more to consider in the area of making their processes environmentally
friendly; in particular, those in the manufacturing industry. In addition to the
green measures all companies take, manufacturers can hold all their processes
up to a green light and see how benefiting the environment in the areas of
emissions control, energy management, and waste management also makes
good business sense.
The costs of abusing energy, working inappropriately with hazardous materi-
als, and subjecting people to unsafe and unhealthy working environments
have materialized in more ways than one. Beyond the financial outlays, a vital
regulatory culture has emerged, creating an atmosphere in which it is now
virtually impossible to conduct business as usual, carte blanche. Businesses
of every type and size must now proactively seek and develop new ways to
comprehensively examine, analyze, and govern their processes such that
they are both profitable and compliant with existing laws and regulations.
This chapter suggests a variety of ways and means to achieve these ends
including changing your company’s culture by establishing new energy man-
agement programs and discovering ways to build your facilities in solid green.
Integrating a GRC program that encompasses all of your business phases,
including your emissions control and waste management, is a point of critical
concern that we shed a bit more light on, too. 

Essentially, your approach to GRC needs to shift from one of bits and pieces —
what amounts to a fragmented approach — to one that delivers key function-
ality across all dimensions of your business processes — a holistic approach.
Without a holistic GRC program, you will be hard pressed to achieve the sort
of flexibility and transparency that is required of your business if it is to meet
current environmental regulations. With it, not only will you be compliant,
but also you will be productive, profitable, and progressing in your program
of going green.
Discovering Ways in which All
Companies Can Go Green
Everyone affects the environment. When you go green as a company, here are
a few areas where you can make changes that both help the environment and
often save money to boot
 Establish an energy management program
 Build, renovate, and clean with sustainable resources and materials
 Recycle
 Reduce travel
The thing about processes is that they are what we do and have been
enshrined as “the way we’ve always done things.” And as you know, if you
keep doing what you’re doing, you’ll get what you’ve always got. In other
words, greening your processes means change, including a cultural shift that
affects every employee in the company.
When your company goes green, the entire corporate culture must undergo
what is known as a paradigm shift: a major alteration in the way it sees,
thinks, feels, and acts about where its resources come from, how much of
them there are, what their consumption can and cannot achieve, and, impor-
tantly, how much it costs to use them.
Reducing Your Energy Use and Costs
The prime mover behind changing your corporation’s general lack of aware-
ness of its energy resources into an attitude of understanding and respect lies
in your ability to show people the consequences of their actions, along with
the work processes that motivate those actions. People must be able to visu-
alize in concrete terms the ways and means by which their actions correspond
to the energy resources that they consume.
190
Part III: Going Green 

For example, the trick to increasing the knowledge of the employees at Kodak
lay in giving them the means by which they could visualize in concrete ways
the relationship between their actions and the energy resources they were
consuming. The management team at Kodak understood that people usually
don’t fully comprehend the effect of leaving the lights on at night. For exam-
ple, we get a bill at the end of the month, and we see that it is perhaps higher
than the month before. Maybe we complain a bit about it, too. Ordinarily,
though, that’s the end of it. A significant shift in thinking and acting has not
come about because of what is essentially a minor statistic. 
However, Kodak’s management also saw that people feel bad when they see
carbon dioxide in the air. But they needed a way to create a link between that
feeling and the fact that the longer we leave the lights on, the greater our
carbon footprint.
To make it concrete, Kodak made polar bears their mascot to help employees
connect their energy use with carbon emissions. News at the time showed a
polar bear that was about to drown because the greenhouse effect is melting
the polar icecaps; the hunting grounds this bear had once been able to swim
to were no longer there, so he just kept on swimming, waiting for them to
appear. Team Kodak made the effective connection between leaving the lights
on and a drowning polar bear to help their people visualize the consequences
of their actions.
In consequence of such presentations, Kodak’s energy management program
began to demonstrate quantitative and qualitative shifts. Of course it didn’t
hurt that Kodak leveraged the shift still more by displaying the facility’s
resource consumption right next to the My HR display, which is where every-
one goes to see the bonuses they receive for contributing to enhanced energy
conservation!

Data centers are a little too hot these days
The green issues developing from the increase
in computing power have emerged as a preemi-
nent concern for companies from Nashville to
Hong Kong. And it’s no wonder: Data centers
consumed about 60 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh)
in 2006, roughly 1.5 percent of the total U.S. elec-
tricity consumption. The energy consumption of
servers and data centers has doubled in the past
five years, too, and that number is projected to
double again over the next five years, to more
than 100 billion kWh. The result is $7.4 billion in
annual costs. A recently issued EPA report
(“Report to Congress on Server and Data Center
Energy Efficiency”), however, showed that data
centers in the United States can save up to $4
billion in annual electricity costs alone by devel-
oping and using more efficient equipment and
operations.[0]

Building, Renovating, and Cleaning with
Sustainable Resources and Materials
Green building principles are changing how we construct and use our work-
places. Provided you take the ten following suggestions for green building,
you will have tools that are proven to lower overhead costs, improve produc-
tivity, and strengthen the bottom line.
Begin at the beginning with green design
Integrating green principles into a building’s design can save 40 percent in
costs and create 40 percent better performance than merely adding green
gizmos to a building put together the old way. To gain maximum advantage,
you must think green from the start. Here are just a few ways that better
design can deepen your green ways: long, narrow building shapes maximize
natural lighting and ventilation for workers; fixed elements, such as stairs,
mechanical systems, and restrooms at a building’s core create flexible and
open perimeters, which also enable more daylight to reach work areas; oper-
able windows and skylights allow natural ventilation in temperate weather;
and windows with low emission glazing minimize interior heat and glare.
The best way to execute green design is to hire the right project team mem-
bers, for example, from your architects and engineers to your contractors
and consultants — people who have expertise with green design tools and
technologies across the gamut. In all likelihood, these experts understand the
principals and characteristics of certification systems such as that established
by the U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental
Design (LEED), which has become a universal means of evaluating how green
a building is. Figure 11-1 shows the web site for LEED. (For more on LEED 
certification, flip ahead to the section, “Getting LEED Certified” later in this
chapter.)
Pick the right spot
To make your facility really green, you can’t build it on the habitat of an endan-
gered species or on farmland, parkland, or historic or prehistoric sites. Nor
can you build it within 100 feet of wetlands. In-fill properties such as parking
lots and vacant lots make for great places to set up sustainable developments,
as do redevelopment sites such as rail yards and remediated brown fields.
When you pick spots such as these, you do two things: First, you avoid adding
to urban sprawl, and second, you avoid risking damage to other environmen-
tally significant areas.
192
Part III: Going Green 

Crunch your numbers
If your project team wants to build green on a standard budget, it first has to
apply a cost/benefit analysis to each of the project’s components. A green
roof costs more to install than a standard roof, for example, but in the end, it
brings a larger return on investment. It lasts longer and provides greater ben-
efits. Standard roofs don’t lower energy costs, either, nor do they enable you
to manage your storm water.
Make friends with your site plan
Your business campus profits greatly when you minimize roads and parking
lots, reduce grading and earth work in general, maximize sediment control,
and create easy access to public transportation — construction costs will be
lower and your overall footprint smaller. Taking these steps also earns you
points with LEED (one of the three major rating systems currently in use by
green builders worldwide, the other two being the U.K.’s Bream and Australia’s
Green Star.)

Chapter 11: Making Your Business Processes Environmentally Friendly

Reduce unnecessary strains on your HVAC
Until now, many people haven’t considered just how much landscaping — or
the lack thereof — can impact heating and cooling costs. The energy from heat
islands — places where sunlight pours onto dark, non-reflective surfaces —
transfers to building interiors, which in turn requires cooling systems to work
that much harder. Covering west- and south-facing building walls with green
screens (metal lattices planted with vines or climbing flowers) can substan-
tially reduce this effect. Mature trees, too, can do the same by shading park-
ing areas, roads, building walls, and roofs on low-rise buildings, roads, and
parking areas. Finally, green roofs landscaped with drought-tolerant grasses
and plants can also reduce the heat island effect.
Exploit the advantages of technology
Taking advantage of technology has always been a great way to get ahead. If
you want to conserve energy, and sometimes even generate it, your company
can install individual climate controls and motion-sensitive lighting sensors.
Highly efficient HVAC systems are now on the market, too. These heating and
cooling units don’t deplete the ozone or require more energy than green (for
example, chlorine free) refrigerants because they don’t use refrigerants that
are based on chlorofluorocarbon, hydrochlorofluorocarbon, or halon.
Command the water
Conservative irrigation systems, waterless urinals (believe it or not, these are
more sanitary than standard urinals), and drought-tolerant landscape foliage
(native plants preferred) that are just as happy with recycled or nonpotable
water. These are just a few ideas to help make you master of your “hydro-
verse.” Water conservation should be a top item on your green building
agenda.
Use green and recycled building materials
Building materials that are both sustainable and nontoxic can now be had on
the cheap, including low and zero-VOC paints, strawboard made from wheat
(as opposed to formaldehyde-laced particle board), and linoleum flooring
made from jute and linseed oil (as opposed to toxin-packed standard vinyl).
Not only are these materials comparable to or less than standard materials 
in price, but also they create a more positive impact on the environment.
Other green materials include 100 percent recycled carpeting and heavy
steel, acoustic ceiling tiles and furniture with significant recycled content,
and soybean-based insulation.

Chapter 11: Making Your Business Processes Environmentally Friendly
Green on the scene: How SAP practices 
environmental awareness
Innovating new technology to optimize business
processes is not the only thing on the SAP radar:
This is one company that is highly concerned
with how its practices impact the environment,
as well. To that end, SAP has established a firm
protocol of green procedures that begin inside
the company itself. For example, to reduce CO2
emissions at its Palo Alto campus, SAP uses
electric vehicles and shuttles, and purchases as
many local goods as possible. Moreover, its uri-
nals are waterless, its lighting system has been
revamped to considerably decrease energy con-
sumption, and all paper products are recycled.
On a larger scale, SAP has a clearly defined
global environmental policy that will be fully
implemented by the end of 2009. To ensure this,
a global head of Social Responsibility who
reports directly to the SAP C-suite and board of
directors has been appointed.
As a further reflection of this commitment to the
environment, SAP has begun construction on a
brand new complex in Philadelphia, PA to house
its American headquarters (shown in the
figure), the entirety of which will be LEED certi-
fied. Among the many features to be included in
the campus structures are
 The ability to harvest natural daylight via
sensors in the lighting system, which auto-
matically dims lights as required (for exam-
ple, rooms will go dark as soon as they are
unoccupied)
 A geo-thermal cooling system that cools
water underground before transporting it
into buildings
 Green roofing

Build smart, build green
If you think that where and what you build is more important than how you
build, think again. For example, providing your people with clean, healthy air
in your buildings has got to be at the top of your list of priorities, right? To
create it, you’ve got to consider your construction processes from the start.
Ensure that your building crews coordinate their wet and dry activities; that
way, you can prevent making dry materials breeding grounds for mold or bac-
teria by contaminating them with moisture. If your mechanical ductwork is
sealed in the factory before shipment and then kept that way until you install
it, there is less chance that it will be exposed to ambient toxins.
Renovate green
Not everyone is building, but renovation and upkeep are a constant process.
If you are not building a new facility from scratch, green renovation is the
way to go. Your green revamp can include everything from a new green roof
to more efficient HVAC and lighting systems, enlarged existing windows, and
low-VOC paints and flooring, to name just a few.
Clean green
Green cleaning is something all companies can do to help the environment
and the health of their employees. Microfiber and green cleaning solutions
can decrease environmental pollutants.

Toyota’s emerald city
The South Campus expansion of Toyota Motor
Sales’ headquarters in Torrance, California, was
as affordable to build as any basic low-rise
business campus. Architects from LPA in Irvine,
California designed 624,000 square feet of space
in two three-story buildings on a budget of $90
per square foot. The buildings are long and
narrow with north-south orientations to maxi-
mize interior daylight — more than 90 percent
of the building’s occupants enjoy natural light
and outdoor views. Rooftop photovoltaic panels
and highly efficient air-handling units and a 
gas-powered chiller enable the facility to
achieve 31 percent more energy efficiency than
the company’s other, traditionally constructed
buildings. As if that is not impressive, the busi-
ness campus’s 40-acre, drought-tolerant land-
scaped site consumes 60 percent less water
than a campus planted with sprinkler-depen-
dent turf. To save a whopping 20.7 million gal-
lons of potable water a year, it uses recycled
water for landscape irrigation, building cooling,
and toilet flushing.

Solvents and cleaners run off through your drainage system and pollute the
environment. If you haven’t done it already, your organization can deepen its
green by switching to nonpolluting cleaning products. Furthermore, the link
between traditional cleaning products and asthma indicates that greening this
area of the company may also help employee health as well as being safer for
the environment. Some materials, such as microfiber, offer effective cleaning
without chemicals.
Recycle
There’s no question that recycling saves money and is good for the environ-
ment. The California Integrated Waste Management Board, estimates that
over the next seven years, $2 billion will be added to California’s economy
and over 45,000 new jobs will be created by meeting the state’s 50 percent
recycling goal. Recycling just one ton of paper per year saves 17 trees and
7,000 gallons of water. The numbers are just as impressive when you recycle
steel and glass, too. Salvaging a ton of steel saves 2,500 pounds of iron ore,
1,400 pounds of coal, and 120 pounds of limestone. When you recycle a single
ton of glass, roughly ten gallons of oil are saved. These are real numbers,
reflecting deeply meaningful benefits.
197
Chapter 11: Making Your Business Processes Environmentally Friendly
Recycling construction waste
Taking steps to recycle your construction waste
saves you money while being kind to the planet.
You’ll find many online resources on this topic,
but here are a few ideas to get you started:
 Ask subcontractors to include waste removal
in their bids. This gives them an incentive to
reduce waste as much as possible.
 Instead of hauling off the concrete and
asphalt from demolished facilities, you can
crush and use it as structural fill for the new
building, saving major dollars. With such an
option, why would you cart the rubble away
and then actually pay for gravel you need to
make structural fill?
 Ask suppliers to remove all unnecessary
packaging to minimize construction waste.
 Process scrap lumber or wood into wood
chips, compost, animal bedding, or boiler
fuel.
 Sell metals such as aluminum, steel, brass,
and copper to scrap metal yards.
 Keep cardboard only dumpsters on the job
site so that a local recycling firm can pick
up cardboard.
 Find out what recycling facilities exist in your
area. You may be able to donate glass to be
recycled into fiberglass or used instead of
sand in paving materials. Asphalt shingles
can be recycled for asphalt paving and
street repairs in some areas.
You’ll find more bright ideas online. Check out
Construction & Demolition Recycling, an online
magazine (www.cdrecycler.com/) as a starting
point.

Of course, the solutions needed to achieve these ends require extra work, but
in the end, considering their importance, they are well worth the effort.
Providing convenient recycling bins near trash cans makes it easier for
employees to recycle rather than simply trash their waste. Special recycling
areas for office recyclables, such as printer cartridges can also be put in place.
Reducing travel
One way for CIOs to help green their companies is to reduce corporate travel
by investing in state-of-the-art teleconference solutions, such as Cisco’s Tele-
Presence. Teleconferencing may not replace all meetings, but if new technolo-
gies can eliminate employee travel by just ten percent, the reduction in your
company’s budget, not to mention its carbon footprint, could be substantial.
Various CIOs have confirmed that the performance of their company’s sales
teams have risen after they deployed videoconferencing. Less travel equals
happier employees — another benefit.
Getting LEED Certified
If you’re really serious about building green, you may want to consider pursu-
ing LEED certification. To achieve LEED certification, your construction pro-
ject must satisfy specific green criteria, which varies according to one of six
credit categories. These include Sustainable Sites, Water Efficiency, Energy

Sick building syndrome
Approximately 23 percent of office workers in the
United States experience two or more sick build-
ing syndrome (SBS) symptoms a year, including
dizziness, nausea, and eye, nose, and throat irri-
tation. Since 2002, when the Indoor Environment
Department at the Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory in California conducted the study, that
percentage can only have risen. On a positive
note, however, the study also showed that the
improved air quality that comes from designing,
cleaning, and building green lowers SBS symp-
toms by 20 percent to 50 percent! Working in
green facilities can also reduce allergies and
asthma by as much as 25 percent, and employ-
ees can be spared outbreaks of the cold and flu
by 9 percent to 20 percent. Healthy productive
employees, lowered healthcare costs: The ben-
efits just keep accruing. It’s something to think
about before that dreaded congestion in your
head makes clear thinking a distant memory.

and Atmosphere, Materials and Resources, Indoor Environmental Quality,
and Innovation in Design. Your project can also earn additional points when 
it incorporates green-building innovations. The level of certification your 
project is awarded depends on points earned, and ranges progressively from
Certified, Silver, Gold, and Platinum. Figure 11-2 shows the Molecular Foundry
at Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory, which achieved a LEED Gold certifi-
cation. Compared with conventional building methods, this facility emits 85
percent less greenhouse gases, as shown in Figure 11-3.
Currently, 2,000 buildings are registered for new construction that adheres 
to LEED. Since 2000, 45 million square feet of structured property has been
LEED certified.

By attaining LEED certification, your company’s buildings are virtually guar-
anteed to reduce their impact on the environment, increase their occupancy
rates, lower their operational costs, and, in all likelihood, increase in value.
As if that’s not enough, there’s a good chance that they will promote improved
employee productivity even as absenteeism is reduced. An overall surge
toward greater corporate social responsibility should also be among the list
of benefits you’ll begin to accrue:
 The LEED standard has been adopted nationwide by federal agencies,
and by state and local governments; LEED’s ratings system and refer-
ence guide is the defining standard for building performance.
 Many private companies are now acknowledging LEED as the industry
standard by which to measure how green their buildings are.
 LEED provides a clearly defined methodology for creating green practices
and structures.
 Following LEED enables companies to avoid the need to establish local
certification bodies.
 It makes good sense.
 It’s the right thing to do!
Here are some companies who own buildings that are now LEED certified:

The following list includes examples of tax credits with which organizations
have been rewarded for attaining LEED certification:
 Baltimore County, MD: ten year tax credit.
 Chatham County, GA: property tax abatement for first five years, which
then tapers off by 20 percent each year for the next five years thereafter.
 Cincinnati, OH: 100 percent tax exception of assessed property value.
 In Maryland, all capital projects greater than $5,000 must earn LEED cer-
tification; commercial developers receive tax credit for building green.
 In Nevada, owners of LEED Silver Buildings receive tax abatements and
tax exemptions for products or materials used in their construction.

 In New York, the State Green Building Tax Credit program provides a tax
incentive to commercial developments incorporating specific green
strategies informed by LEED.
Overall, an increasing number of states are pushing LEED certification, partic-
ularly for public buildings, as shown in Figure 11-4.
Assessing Your Environmental Risks
At the top of your priorities list should be the means by which you address
the level of environmental risk to which your business is exposed. In general,
risk assessment is the scientific process of evaluating the adverse effects
caused by a substance, activity, lifestyle, or natural phenomenon. When your
business assesses its risk, you specifically estimate the type and magnitude
of harm to which you may expose those who come into contact with haz-
ardous substances and dangerous goods that you produce or use in your
processes and products.
Failing to assess your risks, or worse, failing to comply with current laws and
regulations carries penalties, frequently quite severe. Noncompliance could
in fact cost your business millions of dollars. It could even cost you your
business.
After you have endowed your business with the enterprise-wide vision that
results from a comprehensive risk assessment, management at all levels can
avail themselves of the data they need to successfully put effective gover-
nance in place, including setting policies and procedures to ensure compli-
ance. This assessment will also lead toward improved decisions and superior

risk intelligence. You will be able to avoid those missed opportunities of the
past, where efficiency could have been improved and risk/return portfolios
optimized, where your ultimate business predictability and shareholder value
could have skyrocketed but did not, all because you simply did not have the
tools needed to do the job.
Greening Manufacturing
Every company in business today needs to implement a program of culture
change, energy management, and green practices. However, if you conduct
business in the automotive, electronic, high tech, oil and gas, life sciences,
pharmaceutical, textile, food, consumer packaged goods, or cement industry
sectors, among others, complying with environmental regulations is a long-
standing practice (though of course, nearly all businesses can keep working
to deepen their shade of green). This section talks about the challenges faced
by these industries, starting with the C in GRC: compliance.
Green legislation
So far we’ve talked about how all companies can go green. However, for many
industries, going green is not a choice; the C in GRC kicks in, and companies
face compliance with a variety of regulations related to their processes. Here’s
an overview of green legislation applicable to processes. (Note that some
green legislation, such as REACH, relates to products and is discussed in
Chapter 12.)
Although federal governments have taken steps to address climate change in
the wake of startling new revelations about the potential dangers we face
should we continue to ignore the warning signs, it is the states or countries
themselves that have largely motivated the enactment of more green legisla-
tion. The moves have assumed a myriad of forms, from energy efficiency
rebate programs, renewable portfolio standards, and clean energy fund cre-
ations, to high-occupancy vehicle lane adoptions, reforestation, and low-
carbon technology tax incentives. But the last few years in particular have
seen increased public pressures on governments to step up engagement with
all climate matters.
The Northeastern, Mid-Atlantic, and Western states account for nearly 35 per-
cent of the U.S. population and just about a quarter of all consumed power.
No wonder they have exercised the greatest efforts toward creating such reg-
ulations as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) and the Western
Governor’s Association (WGA), both of which seek to implement cap-and-trade
systems that create compliance carbon markets. Other green plans include
low-carbon automotive and fuel standards and greenhouse gas emissions
generator performance standards applied to power purchase contracts.

place for years and another that has just come into effect — the Environmental
Protection Agency’s (EPA) Clean Air and Water Acts, and Waste Electrical and
Electronic Equipment (WEEE) — by whose laws your business must abide,
regardless of whether you intend to go green.
EPA Clean Air Act
The federal 1990 Clean Air Act (CAA) was created by the EPA to help control
and reduce smog and air pollution in the United States. It derives from the
Clean Air Act in 1963, the Clean Air Act Amendment in 1966, the Clean Air Act
Extension in 1970, and the Clean Air Act Amendments in 1977. Although the
whole of America is accountable to CAA legislation, the states nevertheless
contribute to ensuring that its requirements are met. State air pollution 
agencies, for example, conduct hearings on permit applications from power
or chemical plants and fine companies for violating air pollution limits.
Corollaries to the CAA in other countries include the Clean Air Act 1956 in the
U,K. and a similar Clean Air Act in Canada. In European Union, it is called
Clean Air for Europe (CAFÉ).
The EPA wields the CAA to limit the amount of pollutants that can be in the
air in the United States at any given time. According to CAA stipulations,
states are not allowed to create weaker pollution controls than those the Act
has set for the country.
Because pollution control problems often require special knowledge of local
industries, geography, housing patterns, and the like, the EPA relies on states
to create state implementation plans that outline the regulations they will use
to reduce their pollution. All states must conduct hearings wherein the public
can comment on and contribute to the development of implementation plans.
Should the EPA disapprove of a state’s plan, it can take steps to enforce por-
tions of the CAA that they deem the state to have neglected.

Power to the states!
The legal ramifications of climate change were
finally acknowledged in the Supreme Court
decision for Massachusetts, et al. v. EPA, et al.
At long last, the state of Massachusetts was
granted the right to sue the United States
because of the injury it sustained from rising
sea levels and other climate-related impacts.
This granting of standing to sue rivals the impor-
tance of the Court’s proclamation that the EPA
has the authority to monitor greenhouse gases
as an “air pollutant” under Title II of the Clean
Air Act.

To achieve new air quality goals and regulatory reform, the EPA has recently
added new amendments to the CAA. Specifically, the new laws
 Encourage the use of market-based principles and other innovative
approaches such as performance-based standards and emissions trad-
ing. In emissions trading, a system used in the European Union, compa-
nies are issued permits and if they don’t use them, can sell them to
other companies who need them at a profit, with the overall effect of
reducing emissions
 Provide a framework from which alternative clean fuels can be used by
setting standards in the fleet and California pilot program; these can be
met by the most cost-effective combination of fuels and technology
 Advance the use of clean low sulfur coal and natural gas, as well as innov-
ative technologies to clean high sulfur coal through the acid rain program
 Reduce enough energy waste and create enough of a market for clean
fuels derived from grain and natural gas to cut dependency on oil imports
by one million barrels/day
 Promote energy conservation through an acid rain program that gives
utilities flexibility to obtain needed emission reductions through pro-
grams that encourage customers to conserve energy
Through provisions in the EPA, the United States government provides indi-
vidual states with funding to conduct scientific research, engage expert stud-
ies, and engineer new, environmentally oriented designs.
EPA Clean Water Act
Until changes were made to the Clean Water Act (CWA) in 1977, it was known
as the Federal Water Pollution Control Amendments of 1972. It is the main
federal law governing water pollution throughout America. There is also a
Clean Water Act of Ontario, Canada.
When the CWA was originally implemented, efforts focused on regulating dis-
charges from traditional “point source” facilities, such as municipal sewage
plants and industrial facilities, with little attention paid to runoff from con-
struction sites, farms, streets, and other “wet-weather” sources. Greater
attention is now being given to physical and biological integrity of the coun-
try’s waters, as well.
Over the last decade, programs endorsed by the CWA have shifted from
approaches focused on specific sources and pollutants to strategies that are
holistic and watershed-based. This new methodology emphasizes protecting
healthy waters as much as it does restoring damaged ones and addresses a
complete spectrum of concerns, as opposed to the simply looking at those
that are bound by the Act’s regulations. Another characteristic of the new
204
Part III: Going Green 

approach pertains to the involvement of stakeholder groups in the develop-
ment and implementation of strategies for achieving and maintaining state
water quality and other environmental goals.
The CWA is the foundation of surface water quality protection in the United
States today. Although it does not address the regulation of ground water or
water quantity issues, it does ensure the reduction of pollutant discharges
directly into waterways. In addition, the Act helps finance municipal waste-
water treatment facilities and manages polluted runoff. It also hopes to achieve
the broader goal of restoring and maintaining the chemical, physical, and 
biological integrity of the nation’s waters so as to guarantee the protection 
of fish, shellfish, wildlife, and people who participate in water-related recre-
ational activities.
The Act enabled the establishment of a system for granting and regulating
discharge permits called the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES). This system regulates point sources that discharge pollutants into
waters of the United States. Permits are issued by state environmental agencies
and EPA regional offices. There is also a system of regulating the discharge of
dredged and fill material into jurisdictional waters of the United States, handled
by the Army Corps of Engineers under Section 404.
The creation of the Act further precipitated the EPA to institute guidelines that
regulate water pollution from industry categories. These regulations have
been published for 56 categories and apply to between 35,000 and 45,000
facilities that discharge directly to the nation’s waters, as well as another
12,000 facilities that discharge into publicly-owned treatment works. They are
responsible for preventing the discharge of almost 700 billion pounds of pol-
lutants each year. The EPA has updated some categories since their initial
creation, and has also added new categories.
205
Chapter 11: Making Your Business Processes Environmentally Friendly
It cost big bucks to pollute!
Together with the Environmental Protection
Agency, nine states and 13 environmental
groups filed a suit in 1999 against American
Electric Power, one of the nation’s biggest coal-
fired electricity producers, contending that the
company had violated limits set by the Clean Air
Act at 30 of 46 coal-fired units. The company
recently settled, agreeing to spend as much as
$4.6 billion to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide
and nitrogen oxides. It is also forking out $60
million to clean up and repair damage it is
accused of having caused to nearby parks and
waterways.
Yet another recent case involves a group of res-
idents and businesses that is suing IBM Corp.
for more than $100 million. According to the 94
plaintiffs, one of IBM’s former plants in upstate
New York has placed an entire community and
ecosystem at harm’s risk by exposing it to toxic
doses of trichloroethylene (TCE), a metal clean-
ing solvent associated with ailments, such as
kidney cancer and brain damage.

Unfortunately, as of 2007, approximately half of the rivers, lakes, and bays
under EPA protection are still not safe enough for fishing and swimming.
Technology-based standards have been relatively successful because they
apply to specific sources and are enforceable. The health-based and water-
quality-based standards, which focus on specific toxins and the quality of
specific bodies of water, respectively, leave much to be desired and are diffi-
cult to enforce. Non-point source pollution — usually diffused runoff from
farms, streets, and yards — is the most important remaining cause of these
problems; oversights prevented it from being addressed in the original Clean
Water Act.
To help municipalities create wastewater treatment plants capable of meeting
its standards, the Act provides for federal financial assistance in the form of
construction grants. The Act also established pretreatment requirements for
industrial users contributing wastes to Publicly Owned Treatment Works.
Waste Electrical and Electronic 
Equipment (WEEE)
Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE, European Community
directive 2002/96/EC) was created to contend with the rapidly swelling
mounds of electrical and electronic equipment in states of all members 
of the European Union (EU). The directive complements EU measures on
landfill and the incineration of waste. Together with Reduction of Hazardous
Substances (RoHS, Directive 2002/95/EC), WEEE became European law in
February 2003, establishing collection, recycling, and recovery targets for all
types of electrical goods. If your company is working with one or more mem-
bers of the EU, it will affect your business.
This directive holds manufacturers of waste electrical and electronic equip-
ment responsible for disposing of it in an environmentally conscientious
manner, either by ecological disposal or by reuse/refurbishment of the col-
lected WEEE. All such companies should plan to establish infrastructures for
collecting WEEE such that users of electrical and electronic equipment from
private households should have the possibility of returning WEEE free of
charge. The directive requires the substitution of safe materials in place of
various heavy metals (lead, mercury, cadmium, and hexavalent chromium)
and brominated flame retardants (polybrominated biphenyls (PBB) or poly-
brominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE)) in new electrical and electronic equip-
ment put on the market from July 2006. 
206
Part III: Going Green 

According to WEEE, the following items are defined as electronic waste:
 Small household appliances such as microwaves and vacuum cleaners
 Large household appliances such as refrigerators and washing machines
 Entertainment electronics such as televisions, stereos, and DVD players
 Office and communication such as computers, printers, phones, and faxes
 Lighting equipment such as fluorescent light tubes
 Surveillance equipment such as video cameras
 Sports and leisure equipment such as treadmills and Stairmasters
 Automatic issuing systems such as vending machines
 Electronic tools such as drills, saws, chainsaws, and lawnmowers
 Medical appliances and instruments

WEEE man
Together with Canon, the Royal Society of Arts in
the U.K. unveiled a 22-foot tall sculpture entitled
‘WEEE Man’ on London’s South Bank in April
2005. Made from 3.3 tons of electrical goods —
the average amount of electrical waste one U.K.
individual creates in a lifetime — the sculpture,
shown in the figure, was created as a means to
stress the importance of the Waste Electrical
and Electronic Equipment directive that became
law in February 2003. Of the 25 EU member states
directed by WEEE to transpose its provisions into
national law by August 2004, only Cyprus com-
plied. Since its creation, the sculpture has trav-
eled throughout the United Kingdom.

Adopting Green Practices 
for Manufacturing
With a view toward your risks and what you want to achieve, you can con-
tinue to pursue green practices, both where they are mandated and done
proactively before mandates become an issue.
Establish an energy management program
Energy management is the discipline of conserving resources to lower costs
to the greatest possible degree. All businesses need such a program to match
the health and safety measures and emissions controls they have in effect.
The goal of all businesses, of course, is to get the best throughput at the
lowest cost. For example, the last thing you want to do is make your lowest
contribution products during the highest peak hours. What you do want, on
the other hand, is to make your most profitable products using the assets
that are at once the most productive and least costly. 
After your company has established a corporate culture in such a way that
everyone is on board and understands what is best for both themselves and
the planet, you can begin to create a bill of materials for your energy
resources. An energy bill of material, or BOM, is the same as any other BOM.
It is a detailed list of the types and amounts of energy that are used to create
a given product. Creating an energy BOM enables you to attach costs to your
energies in specific ways. If you can’t see how much it costs to use a given
resource, you don’t have the information that is required for revolutionary
innovations. Nothing can be done to make improvements! It is important for
you to see the exact impact that consuming a specific type and amount of
energy has in the overall scheme of things.
To create your energy bill of materials, however, you need metrics — a means
by which to accurately measure your energy usage in near real time. Therefore,
you must first remove the archaic allocation of costs to resources from the
equation. If you allocate your periodic energy bill across all your costs —
when in effect that bill may include multiple stretches of time in a given
period, one that includes various rates for the energy components that go
into the bill — your view of the impact is bound to be skewed.
You cannot see a clear picture of your usage and costs until you first juxtapose
your costs against the energy conditions of any given time. You need to shift
from making decisions around your costs later in the day or week or month
to making those decisions right now, at this very instant. This change is
something that cannot be accomplished by enhanced awareness and nifty
208
Part III: Going Green 

slogans. For example, you can attach metrics software to a specific heat
exchanger to find out how much water is going through it at specific times in
the day. Merely to introduce a kilogram of water to the process system
requires energy. And if it leaves the system with more heat in it than when it
was introduced, then that is wasted energy that results in unnecessarily
higher costs.
Reduce emissions
Another way to guarantee the strength of your environmental compliance
while simultaneously creating a distinction between you and your competi-
tion is to implement a superior emissions management program. 
The first steps toward realizing this goal include building a structured repre-
sentation of your plants and processes, defining and applying all forecast sce-
narios, analyzing your complex emissions data, and establishing performance
goals based on your key performance indicators (KPIs).
Next, to ensure that you can gather the data required for you to surpass all
compliance requirements, you have to track, analyze, and record emissions
measurement data. You have got to build and deploy forecasting tools to
assess the effects of operational modifications, as well, and create alerts 
to automatically detect excessive emissions output. Additionally, you need to
measure the environmental impact of the excessive emissions you do create,
employ tools to indirectly measure greenhouse gas emissions, and then cali-
brate and maintain that measurement equipment.
After you’ve gathered your data, you will be ready to document and create
reports with it. Doing so means that you must analyze and present data in
real-world scenarios, automatically generate and distribute detailed emis-
sions records, maintain contact data for all pertinent authorities, and docu-
ment your communications for shareholders, investors, and the public.
Finally, your organization will want to consider the best ways to participate in
all potential emissions trading and collaborative scenarios. You can project
certain success in this endeavor once you connect to trading platforms and
emissions markets via integrated interfaces, generate all documentation 
and data required for trading approval, employ forecasting tools to estimate
credits, and manage trading process with integrated transaction support.
At the end of the day, instead of interrupting operations just to meet regula-
tory requirements, you will have met them in a way that harmonizes with
your existing manufacturing processes. And rather than searching for emis-
sions credits to meet prescribed targets, you will have generated significant
revenue by selling those credits on emissions trading markets.
209
Chapter 11: Making Your Business Processes Environmentally Friendly

Reduce waste
Unless your environmental health and safety risk assessment process has
accounted for the ways your business treats and manages waste, you still
have work to do. An optimum program centralizes waste management such
that the master data for the by-products of your business processes are
clearly visible, ready to answer any logistics, service management, reporting,
and compliance concerns that may arise. This master data includes details
on waste approval and disposal sites as well as all waste tracking documents,
including waste manifests, consignment notes, transport notes, and data
from any biohazard detection systems (BDSs) that may be in place.
Are your storage, disposal, and treatment facilities on- or offsite? Do you
know exactly how much waste you generate, along with when and where it
comes from? Have you reckoned your costs according to areas and types of
waste? If you have satisfactorily asked and answered questions like these, it
is probable that your waste management program is in good hands. If not, 
it’s important you consider making some changes.
Deal with hazardous substances
Managing the hazardous waste bugaboo so that these substances don’t sneak
into places where they aren’t wanted should be one of your greatest concerns.
Establishing an efficient hazardous substances management system entails
targeting the ways and means by which your company uses hazardous sub-
stances in its daily business. This, in turn, requires instituting documented
ways to handle, store, transport, and dispose of them safely, and to track
them systematically. For a more complete discussion of this subject, please
see Chapter 12.
Like hazardous substances, your dangerous goods must be kept under strict
observation at all times. This subject, too, will be thoroughly discussed in
Chapter 12.
Optimize occupational health
A program that enables you to successfully prevent occupational illness and
injury includes creating a health center with qualified staff able to access
vital information on demand, health surveillance protocols appropriate to
each employee’s personal exposure situation, available physicians, and qual-
ity first-aid training. For a complete discussion of the subject, please see
Chapter 10.
210
Part III: Going Green 

Promote industrial hygiene and safety
Every one of your company’s processes needs to consider the well-being of
your employees, vendors, contractors, and visitors. Included in these consid-
erations are your standard operating procedures, work areas, employee 
training, benefits, incident/accident logs, exposure profiles, and compliance
reporting. For a complete discussion of the subject, please see Chapter 10.
Ensure product safety
This uber-critical facet of your business lives at the core of Chapter 12. For
now, suffice it to say that an appropriate product safety agenda can enable
your company to control specification management, automate product com-
position calculations, initiate rule-based material safety data sheet (MSDS)
authoring, automatically generate and ship MSDSs, receive support for global
hazardous substance management GHS and REACH compliance, implement
global label management, and deploy interfaces for data exchange with con-
tent providers.
Taking the SAP Approach to Making
Your Processes Environmentally Friendly
To ensure both thorough compliance and progress toward environmental
goals, you need a unified, enterprise-wide framework to correlate and align 
all current and forthcoming GRC initiatives. Without this single system of
record, it’s not likely your organization will be able to achieve a comprehen-
sive view of your GRC activities. In turn, the chance that you will be able to
assume a risk-based approach that satisfies multiple, interrelated company
initiatives and regulatory mandates is equally doubtful.
Initiating a successful, unified GRC strategy entails two fronts. First, you need
to implement a company-wide design for your environmental health and
safety processes. Second, you must holistically integrate all of your systems
to create a standard technology platform that provides collaboration 
and communication capabilities and allows you to adapt to new or forth-
coming compliance regulations.
By implementing a central data repository that is reusable, transparent, and
flexible — effectually embedding GRC strategies into the core of all your busi-
ness methodologies — your company will minimize duplicated efforts, opti-
mize effectiveness, and enhance simplicity over the long run. Along the way,
211
Chapter 11: Making Your Business Processes Environmentally Friendly

you will also have established clear systems to manage inefficiencies in every
aspect of your operational phases, from your product safety (which includes
hazardous substances and dangerous goods) and waste management to your
industrial hygiene and safety and your occupational health. If by then your
business has not progressed beyond merely complying and reached that place
where it is actually excelling, rest assured that it won’t be long until you do.
This is SAP’s approach to GRC — integrated so that your environmental risk
assessment feeds into the SAP Enterprise Risk Management (see Chapter 2
for details).
Without customized software integrated into your organizational processes,
your company will have great difficulty meeting industry demands to comply
with the regulatory standards that seem to be growing up around you faster
than luxury condos in every city center. SAP GRC environmental solutions
include SAP Environmental Compliance for emissions control, energy man-
agement, and other regulatory mandates, as well as the Waste Management
module in SAP Environment, Health, & Safety (SAP EH&S) for tracking the by-
products of your processes. Both solutions are fully integrated into the SAP
Business Suite family of business solutions.
SAP Environmental Compliance
The most difficult obstacle to surmount when attempting to comply with
today’s stringent emissions standards and engage in successful emissions
trading is the inability to easily access and use the multitude of systems that
are required to run a typical manufacturing plant. SAP Environmental
Compliance enables you to overcome these barriers. Because it is a compos-
ite application with sophisticated cross-functionality, it provides you with
access to emissions-related applications, functionality, and data that are
trapped in assorted systems spread throughout your company. And not only
can you fully access and exploit these wide-ranging data sources, but SAP
Environmental Compliance also enables you to extract and integrate relevant
emissions-related data from them, which is then used as the basis for
on-going emissions calculations.
As you can imagine, the resulting benefits are legion. When you deploy this
application to its full capacity, you can conquer access barriers, align your
business processes, and enhance the flow of information throughout your
business. The system can monitor, document, and control plant emissions
output, maintain compliance status, and track, document, and create reports
for performance benchmarks. You can also use it to engage in trading, energy
management, and collaboration management to communicate with key stake-
holders, both in and out of the company.
To perform these tasks, SAP Environmental Compliance uses
212
Part III: Going Green 

 Master data from SAP Human Resources
 Material consumption data from SAP Supply Chain Management
 Emissions-relevant substance data provided by the SAP EH&S capabilities
in SAP Product Lifecycle Management
 Equipment data and functional hierarchies produced by the asset life-
cycle management capabilities of SAP Product Lifecycle Management
 Plant maintenance cost information from SAP Financials
 Third-party data historians or other plant floor operational systems via
SAP xApp Manufacturing Integration and Intelligence (SAP xMII)
 Emission-certificate pricing data from third-party emissions trading 
platforms
By participating in emissions trading, companies that meet prescribed
targets receive credits; they can then trade these credits like stocks to
companies that haven’t met their targets (the potential revenue from
such trading is well into the hundreds of millions of dollars)
In addition, SAP Environmental Compliance works with SAP Product Lifecycle
Management to create plant maintenance orders that optimize workflow for
compliance tracking. It updates SAP Financial, too, so that emissions below
the permitted levels are treated as financial assets, and it submits buy or sell
emissions-certificate orders through trading platforms. All required data is
regularly and systematically delivered to SAP Business Intelligence for report-
ing purposes.
Building emissions models and analyzing emissions
With SAP Environmental Compliance, your business can build structured 
representations of facilities and processes. You can also generate records
that detail emissions types, source amounts, and environmental effects, and
automatically estimate complex emissions data. Forecast scenarios can be
defined and applied, and performance goals estimated based on environmen-
tal key performance indicators. When you need to document your communi-
cations as required by industry regulations, this application does it for you,
automatically and on demand.
Managing compliance
Use SAP Environmental Compliance to track, analyze, and record emissions
measurement data, control interactive processes, and exercise risk manage-
ment responsibilities. This application evaluates existing emissions data, as
well, and generates forecast scenarios to assess the effects of operational
modifications. While your asset management teams can deploy it to calibrate
and maintain measurement equipment, your operational teams can lighten
their load by letting its functionality manage workflow and role-based tasks.
Triggers that automatically generate alerts when emission values exceed
213
Chapter 11: Making Your Business Processes Environmentally Friendly

plant limitations can be built within this application. It also enables you to
measure the impact of excess emissions and determine corrective actions,
and employ sophisticated scenarios and tools to indirectly measure emis-
sions, such as greenhouse gas emissions (these are estimated using electric-
ity consumption data).
Creating reports and documentation
With SAP Environmental Compliance’s data warehousing capabilities, you have
the power to analyze and present data and scenarios, generate and distribute
data and reports, and maintain accurate, current information regarding all
authorities involved. Moreover, you can deploy the application to manage
role-based employee access to plant- and process-specific permits. 
Controlling trading and collaboration
Gaining access to emissions trading markets requires your company to collect,
document, and verify the data that is called for by various regulatory agencies.
False or inaccurate data can result in the appearance of counterfeit credits on
the open emissions markets. It goes without saying that those parties who are
responsible can suffer punishments ranging in severity from fines to forced
closure.
SAP Environmental Compliance gives you data management capabilities and
reporting functions that adhere to formats required by regulators, plus inte-
grated interfaces that connect to market places and trading platforms. You can
comply with strict regulations and data provision requirements while taking
advantage of all of the benefits of trading emissions and none of the risk.

SAP Environmental Compliance at E.ON Energie
One of the world’s largest private energy ser-
vices providers, E.ON Energie employs a work-
force of 66,000 around the world, with 40 plants
and buildings across Europe. Its subsidiary, E.ON
Benelux, provides energy to the Netherlands,
Belgium, and Luxembourg. 
E.ON Energie needed to implement a low-cost
solution that would ensure total regulatory com-
pliance while increasing compliance efficiency
and reducing costs for exception and incident
management. At the same time, they wanted to
reduce their risk of noncompliance and simplify
their reporting processes. 
SAP Environmental Compliance gave the com-
pany the tools it needed to meet these goals. It
enabled them to automate their emissions, com-
pliance, and permit management processes. The
solution also provided them with the means to
generate transparency and flexibility in the eval-
uation and analysis of their emissions data. The
company was given an emissions data-auditing
solution that meets modern accounting require-
ments, as well, along with support for automatic
data uploading via SAP ERP and other systems.

SAP Waste Management: A core 
component of SAP Environment, 
Health, and Safety
The Waste Management module in SAP Environment, Health, and Safety cen-
tralizes functionality and tasks to improve the comprehensive visibility, logis-
tics, service management, reporting, and compliance in all of your business’s
waste-related concerns.
SAP Environment, Health, and Safety is fully integrated with SAP ERP, so Waste
Management enables you to access and use data from a host of related but
disparate SAP applications, including SAP Materials Management, SAP Quality
Management, SAP Production Planning, SAP Sales and Distribution, and SAP
Controlling and Finance. Consequently, the business processes that are
enabled by this sophisticated integration run enterprise-wide.
You can organize and manage data for approval manifests and waste disposal
sites, to say nothing of all of your waste master data, including waste types,
amounts, and locations. Procedural processing, invoicing, and cost control,
too, can all be executed under the auspices of this module, as can any task
related to producing reports and documentation.
The ability to automatically produce documents and reports on demand via
pre-established templates and rules is a real boon, since the amount and types
of documents and reports that regulators demand you use to track waste and
comply with standards are astronomical. Your material master data, for exam-
ple, must provide a detailed description of your waste, including its physical
and chemical properties, any other specific properties, toxicological data,
safety data, and associated dangerous goods data. Your waste manifests must
be equally detailed. They need to specify the type and quantity of your waste,
statistical analyses of it, consignment notes, transportation notes and trans-
port emergency cards (tremcards), MSDSs, and BDSs. As well, you must list
the name and location of your disposal partner, and the costs associated with
the disposal. Invoices must also be produced. The list goes on. In short, the
complications related to managing your organization’s waste are enough to
merit a business in its own right.
Before you can build any of the aforementioned documents and reports, you
must first have clearly classified your waste. Depending on the concentration
of hazardous substances in it, waste can be hazardous or non-hazardous. The
Waste Management module of SAP EH&S simplifies and automates this classi-
fication with a tool designed for the automated derivation of data-using rules.
215
Chapter 11: Making Your Business Processes Environmentally Friendly

At the end of the day, compliance will not be the only thing you have
achieved using this module. You will also have established credibility, both
with the public and with the regulatory agencies that monitor you. This credi-
bility has great value. When it comes to your brand, the benefits can hardly
be estimated — the public loves businesses it believes are trustworthy. Your
regulators are overwhelmed; companies that lighten their workload are 
not forgotten and receive such important benefits as early notification of
forthcoming laws and regulations. News like this may enable you to imple-
ment changes faster and sooner and thus gain that extra edge against the
competition.

Making Your Products
Environmentally Friendly
In This Chapter
 Defining hazardous materials and dangerous goods
 Staying current on materials legislation
 Managing customer and supplier compliance
A
t the beginning of this Part, we discuss in general terms what it means
to “go green,” along with some of the main characteristics of “green
people.” The chief concern of any green person or company lies in whether
their actions and the products they make or use are friendly to the earth,
safe, ethically produced and made, recyclable, and energy-efficient. In short,
both green people and green businesses are careful to consider the effect of
their decisions not only on their own quality of life, but also on the quality of
life of everyone around them. Going green is about considering our impact in
all that we do, from cooking with organic food using energy efficient appliances
to manufacturing pesticides in Vapi, India.
As our many examples in this chapter demonstrate, it’s extremely unwise for
any company in business today to shirk its regulatory obligations; noncom-
pliance carries the potential of stiff penalties and lost good faith, either of
which can prove fatal. The way to ensure that you stay on top of the compli-
ance game in all your dealings, and hence profit in the process, is to imple-
ment a comprehensive GRC program that embeds environmental and
sustainability initiatives in every aspect of your operations. The sooner you
do, the happier you, your customers, and your suppliers will be. If that is not
enough of an incentive for change, consider that after you take just a few basic
steps, you’ll have joined the ranks of many others who are doing their share
to protect and preserve the environment. In this chapter, we show you how
to put the focus on making your products green (and no, we’re not talking
about green beer and shamrock cookies for St. Patrick’s Day).

Discovering What It Takes to Make
Products Environmentally Friendly
Given the current social and environmental climate, it should come as no sur-
prise to be asked pointblank whether your products are green. Regardless of
the type of product you make, your ability to answer that question suitably
will depend on a number of factors. Inasmuch as it is possible, for example,
can you affirm that your products are organic and biodegradable? Are all of
the materials and substances in your products GRAS — that is, generally rec-
ognized as safe, non-hazardous, and non-corrosive? Do your products limit
the consumer’s exposure to health hazards and use minimal amounts of
resources to make? Do they minimize the overall impact on the environment?
These are just a few of the considerations your company should be entertain-
ing, if it hasn’t already done so.
Your company has other matters to consider, too, however. The realm of
environmental, health, and safety compliance — where your products must
pass muster if you want to continue selling them on the open market — is no
longer the exclusive province of companies in the chemical or pharmaceuti-
cal industries. The regulatory and brand expenses for failing — or, worse,
refusing — to conform have ensured that compliance is now a central con-
cern for the high tech and oil and gas industries, to say nothing of the food
and beverage, utilities, consumer product, discrete manufacturing, and retail
and service industries. Most municipalities, towns and cities, are now even
bound to comply.
What this means to your business is that you must document to a T every
material that goes into the products you make, sell, and distribute. In addi-
tion, adhering to these regulations means that you’ve got to maintain an 
up-to-date bill of materials, and document the structure, price, weight, and
dimensions of the goods you produce.
Earlier we also pointed out that if you understand your processes, it’s very
probable that you understand and control your products, too. If this is the
case, then you collect, organize, evaluate, and analyze data pertaining to 
your factories and suppliers, as well as to the countries they are located in 
or come from. It may be, on the other hand, that you don’t know any more
about going green than that everyone says it’s a good thing. If this is the 
case, here are some further questions that your company will need to answer
before you can determine how far you are from achieving truly green prac-
tices, and thus, from making environmentally friendly products:
 To begin with, what materials or harmful substances, if any, do you use
in your processes?
 Can your suppliers provide immediate feedback about the compliance of
the materials they use?
218
Part III: Going Green 

 Do you have an overview of environmental regulations in different coun-
tries and the ability to account for variations in compliance requirements?
Whether it’s REACH, Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS), China
RoHS, Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE), or others in an
expanding list of regulations and standards, the compliance challenges and
risks you face are substantial.
Noncompliance can result in costly fines, legal ramifications for top execu-
tives, revocation of operating permits, and loss of brand value or important
customers. If your company doesn’t have a comprehensive GRC program —
whereby environmental and sustainability initiatives are embedded in every
aspect of its operations such that they are consistent across your enterprise
and reflected in the communities where you do business — it’s high time you
figure out what you need to do to make it happen.
Figuring Out What Your Materials 
Are and What They Do
If you think that materials are the only things a product is made of, think again.
Materials may indeed be the heart and soul of your products, but they are a
heart and soul made of very, very important — to say nothing of tricky —
things that regulatory agencies and watchdogs call “substances.”
From man-made synthetics such as gasoline, concrete, and plastics to natural
matter such as cotton, gold, and wood, every material in every product is
comprised of substances. Some of them are pure, and some impure. Moreover,
substances can be made of compounds or elements. Compounds are mixtures
of two or more elements, such as water — a pure substance, by the way. An
element, on the other hand, is a single substance, such as hydrogen or oxygen,
that can’t be broken down into constituent substances.
The question that is no doubt bouncing around in your brain right now like a
stray kernel of popcorn is probably, “Why the basic chemistry lesson?” Don’t
worry. This is where the chemistry ends and the product compliance begins.
The lesson is this: material or substance, pure or impure, everything with
which you make your products must be certifiably documented, right down
to their tiniest constituents. More importantly, you need to know the nature
of every substance in your products, insofar as it is clean or hazardous. Why? 
This is how today’s laws demand that products be classified: either they are
made of clean materials and substances — meaning they pose no threat to
people or the environment — or they are made of materials that are hazardous,
in which case they do pose a potential threat, however minor. Regarding 
environmental, health, and safety compliance, such materials constitute 
two separate categories: hazardous materials and dangerous goods.
219
Chapter 12: Making Your Products Environmentally Friendly

As a business owner, investor, or consumer, after you recognize the far-
reaching impact of these conditions, the way you see and engage the world
will be substantially altered. Dow Chemical has recently acknowledged this 
in its efforts to help people understand that because chemistry is literally
everywhere, there is scarcely anything more important in our lives. When
consumers comprehend the full scope and impact of chemicals in their lives,
they will be sure to insist that the companies with which they do business
comprehend it, too — and then act appropriately. As a result, the way you 
do business can’t help but to change.
Defining hazardous materials
In the United States, hazardous materials are defined and regulated according
to laws and regulations administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA), the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA),
the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC). Although each agency has its own definition, taken as a
whole, these definitions provide a comprehensive picture of the nature of 
hazardous materials.
As we just mentioned, a hazardous material is any item or agent that has the
potential to cause harm to humans, animals, or the environment, alone or
through other factors or agents.
OSHA defines as hazardous any substance that is a health or physical hazard.
This includes
Carcinogens
Irritants
Sensitizers
Toxic agents
Corrosives
Other agents considered hazardous include those that act on the hematopoi-
etic system (the system that makes blood) or damage the lungs, skin, eyes, or
mucous membranes.
Many chemicals are considered to be hazardous materials. Among them are
Combustibles
Explosives
Flammables
Oxidizers
Pyrophorics
Unstable-reactives or water-reactives
220
Part III: Going Green 

Chemicals that when normally handled, used, or stored may produce or
release gases, dusts, vapors, fumes, mists, or smoke that have any of the pre-
viously mentioned characteristics are also considered hazardous materials.
The EPA piggybacks on the OSHA definition of a hazardous material and adds
to it any item or chemical that can cause harm to people, plants, or animals
when released into the environment by:
Spilling
Leaking
Pumping
Pouring
Emitting
Emptying
Discharging
Injecting
Escaping
Leaching
Dumping
Disposing
The DOT defines a hazardous material as any item or chemical that is a risk
to public safety or the environment when being transported and monitors it
as such under the following regulations and codes:
 Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR)
 International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code 
 Dangerous Goods Regulations of the International Air Transport
Association (IATA)
 Technical Instructions of the International Civil Aviation Organization
(ICAO)
 U.S. Air Force Joint Manual, Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military
Air Shipments
In Europe, transportation by road is regulated according to ADR legislation
(International Carriage Of Dangerous Goods By Road — “Accord européen
relatif au transport international des marchandises dangereuses par route”),
while transportation by rail is regulated according to RID (“Reglement
International concernant le transport des marchandises Dangereuses par
chemin de fer”).
The NRC regulates items or chemicals that are “special nuclear source” or 
by-product materials or radioactive substances.
Defining dangerous goods
The same agencies that regulate hazardous materials in the United States
(OSHA, EPA, DOT) regulate dangerous goods, as well. Many hazardous materi-
als are also considered dangerous goods. They may be radioactive, flammable,
221
Chapter 12: Making Your Products Environmentally Friendly

explosive, toxic, corrosive, and biohazardous. Among them are oxidizers,
asphyxiates, pathogens, and allergenics. In short, like a hazardous material, 
a dangerous good is any solid, liquid, or gas that has the potential to cause
harm to humans, animals, or the environment, alone or through other factors
or agents.
Dangerous goods are divided into nine classes, some of which include sub-
classes according to the nature of the harm they can cause.
 Class 1: Explosives
 Class 2: Gases
 Class 3: Flammable liquids
 Class 4: Flammable solids; substances liable to spontaneous combustion;
substances that in contact with water emit flammable gases
 Class 5: Oxidizing substances and organic peroxides
 Class 6: Toxic and infectious substances
 Class 7: Radioactive material
 Class 8: Corrosive substances
 Class 9: Miscellaneous dangerous substances and articles
You might wonder why hazardous materials and dangerous goods are catego-
rized and regulated by different laws if they are mostly the same? Well, actu-
ally, so do we. But the real point is that at the end of the day, all of these
substances, chemicals, articles, and items must be managed, tracked, and
reported on.
Realizing the Benefits of Compliance
The current global market presents more challenges than ever to today’s
businesses, especially those that are working in the design and manufacturing
industries. The total product output of some companies can consist of liter-
ally hundreds of thousands of materials and substances. To guarantee their
environmental, health, and safety compliance demands massive effort, to say
nothing of money. Ad hoc and manual approaches no longer present viable
solutions, because they are largely as expensive as they are inefficient, with a
high percentage of them increasing the risk of non-compliance. Instead, com-
panies must build infrastructures to ensure environmental and product 
compliance whose foundations lie in collaborative supplier and customer
relationships. These solutions must be adaptive, as well; as products change,
so, too, do market demands, and with them related environmental legislation.
222
Part III: Going Green 

The benefits of complying
Think about what the world is saying about product compliance:
 If you are to be fully compliant, your legislators demand that you fulfill
all existing regulations.
 Your customers demand, as well, that you meet their compliance guide-
lines, which are frequently more rigid than those of legislators.
 The analyses performed by your sales and marketing department shows
that your competitors are all compliant. Consequently, you must be at
least as compliant as they are, if you want to survive.
 Negative messages regarding your inability to comply will not be tolerated
by your shareholders. The good faith of your consumer base is dependent
upon whether you can continue to enhance your brand’s reputation.
Given these pressures, it makes perfect sense that so many companies are
investing in environmental, health, and safety compliance solutions. According
to AMR Research’s 2007 IT spending projections, environmental, health, and
safety compliance-related initiatives are the third most important areas impact-
ing future IT investments. It only takes a quick glance at the evidence to see
that the advantages of such investments far outweigh the liabilities.
The sort of comprehensive solution your business needs to step in line with
green directives — one that is integrated into core business processes — will
retrieve required compliance data from sources that are dispersed through-
out your enterprise, automatically determine which data is missing to ensure
strict compliance and minimize risk, and store it in structured form.
Centralizing the data ensures not only that it will be visible and available to
all relevant parties across global operations, but also that the data accessed
is current and accurate. Open standards and flexible communications enable
manufacturers, dealers, suppliers, customers, and regulatory authorities to
speak the same green language. Your IT costs will drop, too, because the
same master data will be used for all materials and products. On the whole,
compliance will be significantly streamlined, thus reducing the time and
effort you spend on compliance efforts while freeing up resources to focus on
other fundamental concerns. This in turn lowers the total cost of ownership.
There are still more benefits to implementing an enterprise-wide solution,
each following from one to the next. For example, when auditors call, you’ll
be able to give them any documentation or reports that they request. As a
result of your tip-top compliance record, the specter of legal fines and other
consequences will vanish. And as soon as the public learns of this, your
image in their eyes and in the media’s will be all the shinier.
223
Chapter 12: Making Your Products Environmentally Friendly

Finally, the barriers that lead to quality problems will largely disappear; your
company’s cross-departmental business processes will have been integrated.
Your sales capabilities will skyrocket, too, because obstacles to the market
will also have been eradicated. Come the end of the day, your competition
will be hard pressed to keep up when your products are reaching the market
faster, greener, and at far less cost. 
The risks of failing to comply
Today’s active laws and directives, Registration, Evaluation, Authorization of
Chemicals (REACH) and Reduction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) among
them, are government-sanctioned. If your company should fail or refuse to
comply with them, the penalties will be immediate. Frequently, they will be
extremely harsh, too, as the record shows.
For example, when a number of Apple’s products did not comply with environ-
mental regulations, many countries in the EU were forced to stop purchasing
them, resulting in heavy losses of revenue on both sides of the value chain.
The same thing happened when Palm, Inc. failed to comply. One of their major
products is no longer available to the European market. 
If you are a company doing business in or with the United Kingdom, it can cost
up to £5,000 per instance for failing to comply with RoHS. The same goes for
failing to submit compliance documentation to any authority that requests it.
The retailer Boots, for example, was penalized for not having informed its cus-
tomers that a percentage of its profits are put into a product recycling fund.
In Germany, regulators fine noncompliant businesses 50,000 and ban their
products from the market. In France, companies can be fined 7,500 for an
infraction. Spain and Ireland, on the other hand, are off the charts when it
comes to fines: In these countries, you can suffer penalties of upwards of 
1.2 million and have your products removed from your customers’ shelves! 
A penalty was issued against a Dutch producer that refused to comply with
the Waste Electrical and Electronics Equipment (WEEE) directive; another
was levied against municipal authorities for failing to create a municipal recy-
cling location. Sony used more cadmium in their PlayStations than is allowed
for by RoHS in the Netherlands and paid for the mistake dearly: When the
country refused to sell the product in 2001, Sony lost an estimated $110 mil-
lion in revenue.
The moral to the story is clear: failure to comply with product safety regula-
tions results in lost revenue and fines, delayed or restricted access to the
market in the short term, and lost market share in the long term, all of which
can result in still more costs that are precipitated by the emergency measures
you will likely have to implement when confronted with these unwanted out-
comes. As we noted in Chapter 9, the events that resulted from the failure of
toy giant Mattel to produce environmentally friendly products were both 
224
Part III: Going Green 

disastrous and globally infamous. In 2007 alone, the company had to recall 18
million toys around the world. Because of this mistake, Mattel continues to
face declining market share.
Using Hazardous Materials Responsibly
Whether you are producing and selling hazardous substances and dangerous
goods or purchasing them for use in your own processes, managing them so
that they don’t sneak into places where they aren’t wanted should be one of
your greatest concerns. Establishing an efficient EH&S management system
entails targeting the ways and means by which your company uses hazardous
substances and dangerous goods in its daily business. This, in turn, requires
instituting documented ways to handle and store them safely, and to track
them systematically.
Specifically, you will need to
 Register your materials
 Store materials safely
 Classify and identify the hazardous substance
 Create an inventory that details all hazardous substances and dangerous
goods in your possession
 Monitoring hazardous substance concentrations in the workplace
 Determine and assess risks to employees, vendors, contractors, and 
visitors
 Arrange, undertake, and monitor the success of protection measures
 Create standard operating procedures for work areas and substances
 Conduct employee health and safety briefings about hazardous sub-
stance handling
 Implement standard protocol to handle and report accidents
 Report safety records
 Package and identify hazardous substances and dangerous goods in
accordance with regulations
 Create and manage labels, transportation emergency cards (tremcards),
and current, accurate material safety data sheets (MSDSs)
 Ship material safety data sheets before delivery or when the hazardous
substance is delivered, as well as after they have been changed
These tasks fall into four main categories: customer compliance management,
supplier compliance management, compliance reporting, and comprehensive
225
Chapter 12: Making Your Products Environmentally Friendly

task management. In the next few sections, we look at each in a little more
detail.
Customer compliance management
Your solution should enable you to respond to customer compliance requests
quickly and accurately. It should also allow you to record all replies to cus-
tomer queries about any given product and automatically tell you which 
customers require new documents in the event of changes or new environ-
mental conditions. Such functionality will lower your costs across the board,
especially if you’re making large quantities of product in conjunction with
multiple global suppliers.
Supplier compliance management
It is as important to exchange product data with suppliers as it is to do so
with customers. Your solution to supplier compliance management should
include a current, accurate database and be able to automatically request
missing data about contents, substances, or compositions that you can
receive from suppliers in standard formats. After you have the data, you’ll
need to document it for subsequent inspection. If details or regulations rele-
vant to your product change, you should be able to send a request to your
suppliers for updates.
Compliance reporting
Yet another functionality you need is the ability to generate and distribute
reports that meet the requirements of all parties in the compliance chain —
from regulatory authorities and product developers to environmental officers
and customers. You also want to track both the creation date of particular
reports and the recipients, so that you can generate and sending new reports
in the event of detected changes. With strong document and data manage-
ment capabilities, duplications will be a thing of the past, and you’ll be able
to circumvent the difficulties of conflicting data formats, multiple languages,
and change management.
Comprehensive task management
Suppliers, customers, regulatory authorities, internal departments, factories,
sites, and overseas subsidiaries — these are all participants in the compli-
ance process, and you must be able to cooperate with each of them together
226
Part III: Going Green 

and in groups. For example, when you want to see whether a product is RoHS
compliant, you need to verify all information, such as the lead content of a
part that you purchased from a supplier. If data is omitted, the ideal solution
would automatically request that the supplier provide you with the exact
lead-weight percentage of the product and confirm when the data arrives. 
Working with Hazardous Materials
It should go without saying that there are serious consequences associated
with producing, handling, and shipping hazardous materials and dangerous
goods, particularly if improper procedures are involved. Accidents while
transporting these materials are of special concern, which is why a well-
structured rubric of standardized procedures, methods, and regulations 
has been established to help ensure public and environmental safety.
Hazardous materials and dangerous goods work their way up and down the
supply chain, from outside, on your vendor side, and from within, to your
customers. Along the way, extreme care must be taken to store these buga-
boos when and where needed. Meantime, you must know exactly where they
are, and you must know how much there are, as well. To guarantee maximum
control and subsequent adherence to applicable industry regulations, you
need to establish a system whose functionality enables your operational
teams to transparently maintain all dangerous goods master data, including
their automatic classification using expert rules.
The laws that regulate the transportation of hazardous materials and danger-
ous goods are those we mentioned earlier in this chapter in the section called
“Defining hazardous materials.”
Packing
In the United States, the Hazardous Materials Regulation (HMR), created by
the Department of Transportation (DOT) Pipeline and Hazardous Materials
Safety Administration (PHMSA), outlines the rules for packing all hazardous
materials and dangerous goods so that they can be safely transported. The
HMR stipulates how to
 Classify and package hazardous materials
 Mark and label packages
 Complete shipping papers
 Provide required emergency response information
227
Chapter 12: Making Your Products Environmentally Friendly

In addition, the HMR specifies whether the vehicle transporting hazardous
materials must be placarded and the specific placards required, along with
the amount and type of training required to handle and ship hazardous 
materials. 
Not all countries use the same graphics (label, placard, and/or text informa-
tion) in their national regulations. Some use graphic symbols, but without
English wording or with similar wording in their national language.
Materials communications
Communicating information pertaining to the hazardous materials or danger-
ous goods you are transporting and the potential hazards associated with
them requires that you produce and manage detailed documents about them,
including multilingual material safety data sheets (MSDSs) and transportation
emergency cards (tremcards), as well as the appropriate placards and labels
on the goods themselves.
A sophisticated material safety data sheet (MSDS) system plays a key role in
these areas. Its database constitutes the central storage location for all infor-
mation about the materials your company uses or produces. And should
someone be harmed by a hazardous substance or dangerous good, your cur-
rent, accurate database enables you to record the incident in your exposure
log and then create the subsequent required reports.
You’ll need to be able to answer questions about your use of hazardous mate-
rials, so you’ll need to have all your information in good order. Check whether
the data in your vendor MSDS is up-to-date; organize your vendor MSDS for
audits and other official checks; link vendor MSDSs to material masters; 
prepare safety operating procedures such that they are readily available in
appropriate work areas; and, lastly, ensure that labels on incoming materials
reflect hazardous information in respective vendor MSDSs.
Transporting materials
The transportation of hazardous materials and dangerous goods is subject 
to the most widely regulated practices in the world, which are standardized
on the whole by Model Regulations on the Transportation of Dangerous
Goods. This set of directives is issued by the Committee of Experts on the
Transport of Dangerous Goods of the United Nations Economic and Social
Council. The International Civil Aviation Organization’s regulations for air
transport of hazardous materials are a modified version of this model, for
example. Many other individual airline and governmental requirements are
incorporated with the ICAO’s regulations, as well, per the universally abided
International Air Transport Association Dangerous Goods Regulations.
228
Part III: Going Green 

Transportation by sea requires compliance with similar legislation, as well,
and is overseen by the International Maritime Organization. To be certain that
their national regulatory schemes accord with international law, individual
nations around the globe have built the transportation regulations for their
dangerous goods to meet the requirements of the UN’s Model Regulations.
No matter what mode you use to transport your goods, your company must
ensure that the drivers of road vehicles and stewards (for those goods moving
by rail, air, or sea) have instructions in writing that detail the exact type, quan-
tity, and nature of those goods. Those companies that move goods by road in
Europe, for example, must comply with ADR legislation. It demands that all
drivers be in possession of a tremcard, composed in a language that he can
read and understand. These instructions must also include a version in the
language of the country of origin, of the recipient country, and of all countries
through which the dangerous goods are being transported.
Keeping Up with Materials Legislation
The myriad laws, regulations, and directives that have been enacted since the
mid-twentieth century to protect both humanity and the environment are 
the number one reason why today’s companies need a substantial GRC solu-
tion for all matters related to environmental, health, and safety compliance.
Among the ones that stand to most influence businesses and society alike 
are Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH) and
Reduction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS). The following sections detail
those regulations that your company must comply with if you want to stay 
in business.
Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)
Congress created this Act in 1976 so that the EPA could track the 75,000
industrial chemicals currently produced or imported into the United States.
Whereas the EPA can screen these chemicals, require reporting or testing of
those that may pose a danger to environmental or human health, and ban the
manufacture and import of those chemicals that pose an unreasonable risk, 
it nonetheless grandfathered most existing chemicals. This is significant, and
stands in direct contrast to the European Union’s newly enacted Registration,
Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH), which we cover in the
next section. The primary subjects of TSCA regulation are polychlorinated
biphenyl (PCB) products, including PCB disposal and limits for PCB contami-
nation of the environment. The TSCA is found in United States law at 15 USC
(C. 53) 2601-2692.
229
Chapter 12: Making Your Products Environmentally Friendly

The TSCA has several subchapters, the second of which authorizes the EPA
to impose laws for asbestos abatement in schools and requires accreditation
of persons who inspect for asbestos-containing materials (the first subchap-
ter treats the regulation of the aforementioned PCB products). The other 
subchapters require the EPA to publish a guide to radon health risks, perform
studies of radon levels in schools and federal buildings, identify sources of
lead contamination in the environment, regulate amounts of lead allowed in
products, including paint and toys, and establish state programs to monitor
and reduce lead exposures.
The TSCA supplements other Federal statutes, too, including the Clean Air
Act and the Toxic Release Inventory under the Emergency Planning and
Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA). As a result of the TSCA, the EPA has
been negotiating with firms such as General Electric for the remediation of
areas such as the upper Hudson River, which is contaminated with PCBs. 
Registration, Evaluation, Authorization 
of Chemicals (REACH)
Until its final enactment on June 1, 2007, REACH (EC 1907/2006) was a matter
not only of serious legislative debate, but also on the receiving end of bitter
condemnation. And though it may still be grounds for all sorts of feelings,
good and bad, the fact is that its regulations will force businesses around the
world to make some excruciating decisions about tens of thousands of sub-
stances by June 2008, because that is the date of the first regulatory deadline
set to affect existing chemical products. REACH, whose provisions will be
phased-in over 11 years, now replaces 40 existing pieces of legislation in the
European Union (EU). Companies can find explanations of REACH in the guid-
ance documents, on the EU’s REACH web site (see Figure 12-1) and a number
of help desks are available for consultation. The European Commission is
slated to conduct a series of reviews of REACH Annexes until December 2008
(Annexes I, IV, V, XI, XIII).
What REACH says
The TSCA (which hasn’t been amended since its enactment over 30 years
ago) is to REACH what a speck of dust is to the sun. The difference between
them — to say nothing of both the immediate and long-term consequences of
the latter — is enormous. Remember our discussion on the difference
between substances and materials? Well, this is where those differences
come into play even as they are obliterated. Forget materials. REACH forces
companies to comply on the level of substances — an enormous task com-
pared to complying with the TSCA.
230
Part III: Going Green 

The current registration process, in which you must register every product
you make with the European Chemicals Agency (ECA), covers nearly 30,000
substances. Of these, 2,500 are likely to be hazardous to human health or the
environment and will have to undergo continued testing to show that they
can be used safely. Over the next dozen years, however, as many as 100,000
existing substances will be subject to REACH evaluation, authorization, and,
in many cases, restriction. Ultimately, the ECA estimates that a total of 150,000
to 200,000 substances will be registered, though some authorities put that
number much higher, going so far as to suggest that there will be half a mil-
lion applications for approval.
Who REACH affects
American companies under the impression that they will not be affected by
this law because it derives from EU legislation are sorely mistaken. If you are
one of them, you would do well to adjust your attitude immediately. In fact,
REACH should assume the status of a critical business matter that will affect
the operations of your company, your vendors, and your customers across
whole enterprises.
REACH is so important that Robert Matthews, a REACH authority and partner
in the Washington-based law firm McKenna, Long & Aldridge, has recom-
mended that industry executives “elevate REACH compliance from the envi-
ronment, health, and safety departments in [their] firms to the level of a
business development-unit reporting directly to the company president.”
Recently, Dupont assigned top-level executives to manage REACH compliance
and processes — an indication of how serious and important this issue is to
businesses today.
Figure 12-1:
The EU’s
REACH site
provides
compliance
information.
231
Chapter 12: Making Your Products Environmentally Friendly

Supervision from the top is necessary, Matthews says, because compliance
with REACH by U.S. businesses will require executives to make decisions that
will significantly affect their “product selection, exports, suppliers and cus-
tomers and use of products by customers.” Those businesses that fail to pre-
register their products with the ECA in the six-month window between June
and December of 2008 risk losing their phase-in status during the subsequent
authorization period. If that happens, their products cannot be brought to
market, because continued production or import of chemicals and substances
that are not preregistered will be illegal. The ramifications don’t end there,
however. Your substance only needs to be listed as a candidate for blacklisting
under REACH for it to lose status as a marketable product on a global level. In
such cases, companies need to have alternative products ready to go.
One good thing about the preregistration process is that you are not required
to provide every piece of data about your substances for long-term registra-
tion. To begin, you only need the name of the substance, its chemical abstract
and European inventory numbers, and range of production volume. Each
chemical product or substance will be given one registration number under
REACH.
Registration is not the only process involved in complying with REACH, how-
ever. For example, those companies that produce or deal in common bleach,
which is used in products as diverse as paper, makeup, and cleaning supplies,
must also provide their customers with appropriate compliance documenta-
tion, conduct testing based on foreseeable use-case scenarios, and share
resulting information with others in the industry so that they, too, can con-
duct testing.
The process by which multiple producers of the same substances share data
is both facilitated and formalized when they gather together in substance
information exchange forums (SIEFs). This collaboration will enable them to
facilitate registration by compiling existing information (such as health risks,
toxicity, test data, controls, and so forth), conducting studies and exposure
scenarios, and resolving chemical classifications. Collaboration on this 
level requires some serious cooperation. And also merits extreme caution:
Participating companies must avoid antitrust complications pertaining to 
the exchange of information or the making of agreements that may prevent,
restrict, or distort competition. Beyond participation in SIEFs, two or more
manufacturers or importers can choose to band together in consortia and
handle their registrations jointly. Although such arrangements may facilitate
compliance, they should also be reviewed carefully for potential antitrust
issues.
The phenomenal effort required to participate in SIEFs, in conjunction with the
sustained costs and effort required for REACH registration and evaluation, may
push some companies to sacrifice pre-registration for some of their products,
232
Part III: Going Green 

especially if those products are not among their top sellers. This, actually, is
one of the goals of REACH. Over the long-term, it will force companies to with-
draw what regulators have termed “substances of very high concern” (SVHC).
By forcing changes in the market strategies, research and development, prod-
uct selection and substitutions of companies, REACH is sure to affect compa-
nies everywhere, even those that do not do business in Europe. In this sense,
the law presents much more than just a matter of product stewardship and
environmental concern.
As for the estimated costs of REACH, they are astronomical. According to the
European Commission, the chemical industry alone is set to fork out $3.1 bil-
lion in direct expenses. The indirect numbers that will result from laboratory
test work, managerial and administrative labor, new software implementation,
safety-data gathering, and legal fees — to say nothing of the costs associated
with merely using affected chemicals — are estimated to skyrocket as high as
$2.9 billion.
According to a survey of 62 multinational companies by the Dutch company
KPMG, 92 percent expect REACH to affect the availability or price of raw
materials and products. Nearly 30 percent expect REACH to affect more than
a quarter of all materials and products, and approximately 10 percent do not
think they’ll be able to manufacture certain products once REACH takes full
effect.
Given the supply-chain issues that will result from the enormous scale of
REACH, it is the small to mid-size companies that are likely to suffer the great-
est losses, along with companies that produce specialty chemicals. For exam-
ple, distributors will have to pass information up and down the supply chain,
in which case breaches of confidentiality are sure to result. After customers
learn who the major suppliers are, it is only a matter of time before the 
middleman is cut from the chain.
The following list includes some steps suggested to help prepare for and miti-
gate REACH’s impact:
 Ascertain which REACH requirements will affect your products, cus-
tomers, and suppliers
 Implement structures to guarantee executive responsibility and 
accountability
 Create a fund to handle your compliance response
 Decide which products you intend to pre-register well before the June
2008 deadline
 Define your research and development efforts to accord with REACH so
that you can transition to alternate substances should any products be
threatened by blacklisting

Reduction of Hazardous 
Substances (RoHS)
Reduction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS), an EU directive that is part of a
global push toward more environmentally sound manufacturing practices
and policies, restricts the use of six substances in new electrical and elec-
tronic equipment placed on the market after July 1, 2006. By making it illegal
for companies to manufacture products with more than 0.1 percent of lead,
mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyls (PBB),
and polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE), RoHS aims to reduce pollution
and prevent human health problems. China, Japan, and all EU countries are
bound by RoHS.
Evidence of compliance with RoHS needs to be provided only if an enforcement
authority asks for it. Failure of an organization to comply with RoHS can result
in serious penalties (including heavy fines and jail time), not to mention a black
eye for your reputation. When requested, you must provide documentation of
compliance to the governing bodies through materials declarations or analysis.
Some medical devices and military equipment that contain lead are exempt
from RoHS regulation.

One approach to REACH: Dow Corning
Dow Corning, a manufacturer of silicones and
polycrystalline silicon, is one of numerous com-
panies in the chemical industry that sees the full
scope of implications posed by REACH and is
taking active steps to address them all on every
front, including those to ensure sustainable
development and improve the levels of protec-
tion to human health and the environment.
Preparing internally for SIEF and consortia par-
ticipation, as well as for the registration of
nearly 100 Silicon-based substances and other
raw materials, filling gaps in data needed for
registration dossiers, updating compliance doc-
umentation, and managing an extensive IT port-
folio are only a few of the things Dow Corning is
doing to ensure that their company is still viable
under REACH.
Their business-centric approach also entails
conducting product-line REACH workshops, edu-
cating professionals about REACH, highlighting
issues specific to products lines, mining data,
evaluating entire product portfolios, determining
the volumes of substances manufactured and
imported into Europe, and assessing the impact
of REACH on sales and profits. In addition, to
guarantee communication requirements both up
and down the supply chain, the company is
engaging in comprehensive dialogues with its
suppliers, customers, and distributors. The
immediate effort includes identifying a REACH
contact person at each company and establish-
ing solid REACH messaging. 
Finally, the company’s concern with future
directions is manifested in their ongoing exam-
ination of the various business and investment
decisions that will be driven by REACH to refor-
mulate and requalify their product lines.

EU manufacturers must obtain a declaration of RoHS compliance for every
part, component, and material they use. To prevent undue complications,
however, they may obtain just one certificate of declaration for parts that
belong to the same class or type with the same RoHS-compliant composition.
Importers, however, must request equipment suppliers to declare compli-
ance for their equipment.
In China and Japan, electronic information products (EIPs) must be labeled
as 100 percent compliant or partially compliant (having one or more sub-
stances) with the Environmental Protection Use Period (EPUP), which states
the number of years that the consumer will be safe from product leakage.
Mandatory product testing is being considered in both countries.
The products affected by RoHS include
Household appliances
IT and telecommunications equipment
Consumer equipment
Lighting products/systems
Electrical and electronic tools
Toys, leisure and sports equipment
Automatic dispensers
Business affected by RoHS include
 Manufacturers and sellers of electrical and electronic equipment
 Resellers of electrical and electronic equipment
 Companies that import or export electrical and electronic equipment
from and to countries in the EU 
The following list includes some steps suggested to help ensure that your
products comply with RoHS:
 Test your materials
 Monitor your supply chain partners for compliance
 Searching for and switching to RoHS-compliant suppliers
 Produce, organize, and maintain proper documentation of compliance
Exploring the SAP Approach 
to Product Compliance
By now, you’ve seen that no matter what your business today, you must
comply with a growing host of environmental regulations and customer
requirements — a minimum of 15 environmental regulations in over 15 
countries — by collecting, organizing, analyzing, evaluating, and documenting
235
Chapter 12: Making Your Products Environmentally Friendly

data about the precise makeup of your products. To do so requires software
solutions that run enterprise-wide even as they streamline your processes. 
In short, you’ve got to automatically monitor the compliance status of your
products, facilitate communication with suppliers and customers, and enable
users to generate and manage reports quickly and efficiently. The SAP solu-
tion for environmental product compliance can help to meet all of these chal-
lenges. Developed on the SAP NetWeaver platform, the solution is part of the
mySAP Product Lifecycle Management application, which seamlessly inte-
grates with SAP Product Safety, SAP Materials Management, and SAP Sales
and Distribution, among others. Specifically, it includes the SAP Environment,
Health & Safety application (which contains SAP Hazardous Substance
Management and SAP Dangerous Goods Management) and the TechniData
Compliance for Products application.
Compliance for Products 
by TechniData (CfP)
Until now, the dominant means of gathering data across multiple disconnected
sources has been the spreadsheet, which, in addition to being error-prone
and expensive to maintain, generally impedes efficient analysis. The other
shortcoming of spreadsheets is that you can’t integrate them into your core
processes to streamline compliance tasks. If you have been trying to meet
compliance regulations using spreadsheets in conjunction with other stand-
alone solutions, you’ve probably struggled, besieged from beginning to end
by an overwhelming mass of disjunctive documents and data.
Technidata’s CfP can integrate into your ERP ecosystem without any additional
interfaces, providing you with a business solution that is both transparent
and adaptive on a single standardized, platform. Armed as such, your com-
pany can ensure the successful attention to environmental requirements for
product development, sourcing, procurement, and manufacturing — today
and tomorrow. 
The solution retrieves compliance data from widely dispersed sources through-
out the enterprise and automatically determines which information is missing.
After data is received, not only does CfP store it in structured form, but 
also it renders it to meet a diverse spectrum of data formats, including the
International Material Data System (IMDS), Automotive Industry Action
Group (AIAG), Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), IPC
1752, or Microsoft Excel. Consequently, all pertinent compliance data is avail-
able on demand to participants anywhere along the value chain. 
The CfP solution offers a number of key functional areas for compliance man-
agement, all of which are accessible from the compliance manager cockpit,
which serves as the central user interface. From the cockpit, you can import,
236
Part III: Going Green 

export, and store all compliance data, because it is integrated with either the
internal bill of materials in your SAP software or another external product-data
management application. It also enables you to enter data manually, query
supplier data, and check if products meet particular conditions. With CfP, all
data is centralized, so you can reuse it at any time to fill requests for reports
and declarations. You can run future assessment scenarios to determine the
impact of alternative product parts or suppliers on your ability to maintain
compliance, and you can generate, manage, and distribute customer docu-
mentation. The compliance manager cockpit interface supports version man-
agement, change pointers, and customer-specific standard formats, as well.
The scope and depth of businesses and products for regulatory agencies to
monitor make it impractical or impossible to guarantee compliance under all
circumstances. Consequently, they expect your company and your supply
chain partners to maintain reliable due diligence processes. To determine
that reasonable steps to comply have been taken, authorities will request
compliance documentation and inspect the processes that you use to collect
data and evaluate your product, as well as any number of other analyses.
With CfP, you can rest assured that your business will easily pass these tests.
The key functional areas in CfP include
 General Compliance Management
• Manage activities such as to-do lists, where-used lists, and change
requirements and communicate with all supply-chain partners.
• Control lists of materials and substances prohibited by WEEE and
RoHS, among many others.
• Maintain product structure required to comply automatically.
• Calculate product data required to comply automatically.
• Retrieve comprehensive product status using traffic light 
functionality.

BOM structure modifications, and customer requests.
 Compliance Reporting
• Generate flexible reports that fulfill all declaration requirements
and define report release strategies.
• Analyze compliance issues according to supplier, part number, and
regulatory-list criteria.
 Supplier Compliance Management
• Use latest communication standards (for example, Nemi, IPC,
RossettaNet, AIAG) to exchange compliance request data with sup-
pliers about all products.
237
Chapter 12: Making Your Products Environmentally Friendly

• Define due dates and send reminders for compliance requests to
all suppliers.
• Upload supplier compliance status and parts information using
open data exchange capabilities.
• Enable all suppliers to retrieve compliance request information
from your system.
 Customer Compliance Management
• Retrieve and manage customer compliance requests and statuses.
• Confirm compliance by declaring all customer compliance requests.
• Track all relevant data exchange with customers using flexible
methods (e-mail, portal, and so on).
SAP EH&S
Like CfP, SAP Environment, Health & Safety offers a fully integrated solution
for all of your product compliance issues on a single, standardized platform.
The material master — the central data object in this system — is a product
of this integration, reaching across the enterprise to centralize your core
business data and enable you to access, examine, organize, modify, and docu-
ment information pertaining to sectors as diverse as accounting, operations
scheduling, distribution, warehouse management (including available stock),
and purchasing — all toward the goal of quickly and efficiently managing
your product safety, hazardous material, and dangerous goods needs. It is
also used to represent raw and auxiliary materials, utilities, semi-finished
products, production resources, and tools.
Here are the most important hazardous substance and dangerous goods 
management functions in SAP EH&S: 
 Substance specification management: Flexible, central storage of all 
dangerous goods and hazardous substance and agent data.
 Specification workbench: Enter and edit all specification data from a 
central interface.
 Phrase management: Maintain language-independent information in text
form.
 EH&S Native Language: Store, display, and print compliance reports 
correctly.
 EH&S Expert and EH&S Easy Expert: Automatically execute variety of
work steps such as the rating of hazardous substances.
 Material-to-specification assignment: Assign one or more materials to 
a specification, or one or more specifications to a material (links to

238
Part III: Going Green 

 Bill of materials transfer: Automatically generate hazardous substance
composition from the bill of material.
 Work area management: Enterprise structuring from the point of view
of hazardous substance management.
 Risk assessment: Introduce and track safety measures after determining
and evaluating hazards.
 Health and safety briefing: Present organized health and safety informa-
tion to employees who work with hazardous substances.
 Document templates: Use templates to facilitate the flexible creation of
EH&S reports. 
 Report generation: Create of EH&S reports.
 Generation variant: Link document templates with a validity area and
one or more ratings to precisely control how reports are generated.
 Report management: Access, check, release, and manage all existing,
inbound, and outbound EH&S reports.
 Report shipping: Manually and automatically distribute EH&S reports 
to employees, customers, and suppliers.
 Material safety datasheets: Define dangerous goods and hazardous
material transport papers and generate them automatically or manually.
 Sales and distribution processing: Define dangerous goods and hazardous
material checks and process them through SAP Sales and Distribution. 
 Global label management: Determine and print correct labels for 
hazardous substances and dangerous goods. 
 Specification information: Access and output all dangerous goods and
hazardous system substance data. 
 Industrial hygiene and safety information system: Access and evaluate
work areas, exposures, risk assessments, and safety measures and
create hazardous substance inventories. 
 Data import and export: Transfer dangerous goods and hazardous
material data to and from legacy systems, suppliers, and data providers.
 Portal: Provides access to all internal and external functions and infor-
mation via a tailored interface.

dangerous goods are
 Substance volume tracking
 Document management and shipping
 Bill of materials transfer
239
Chapter 12: Making Your Products Environmentally Friendly

 Specification information system
 Phrase management
Substance volume tracking
This feature provides a structure for controlling the substance volumes needed
for REACH and other regulatory reporting. It tracks substance volumes by
monitoring the relevant material movements in the SAP system, exploding
materials to base ingredients through bills of material, material-specification
assignments, and compositions. It derives and aggregates required data for
other relevant criteria, too, such as year, plant, and country. You can define
threshold limits for each regulation and substance, and execute Web-based
checks via other business processes, including purchasing, production, and
sales. When the system determines that a regulatory limit has been met or
exceeded, either it will send a warning or block the relevant business process.
Document management and shipping
The solution enables you to manually or automatically locate, generate,
manipulate, organize, and ship high-quality documents and reports such as
MSDSs, standard operating procedures, and labels in a variety of formats.
Because the solution enables precise control of the amount and content of
the data in your documents, you can create documents that are specific to
your product and to both the destination countries and those through which
the goods will travel. Multilingual documents and labels can be created, too,
as can complex labels.
Your documents can hold all specification data, as well as graphics and other
documents. Using a modified version of Microsoft Word (Windows Word
Processor Integration [WWI]), you can define the exact document layout.
Version and status management is also available for use with documents,
including those that you import. You can search documents with user-
friendly functions, via the Internet or your company intranet. Further, the
solution can automatically determine whether an MSDS is required based on
an order or delivery through SAP Sales and Distribution. After it has ascer-
tained which MSDS (or bundles of MSDSs) it needs, the system automatically
locates, produces, and distributes them, ensuring that all legal requirements
are fulfilled.
Bill of materials transfer
You can use the bill of materials transfer solution to create the composition
of a specification that is assigned to a material from your bill of material
(BOM), either manually or automatically, creating new specifications and
their compositions or changing existing ones during the process. The EH&S
Expert automatically generates the data you need and converts units of mea-
surement. The system also changes the composition of the specification
accordingly if an item in the BOM changes. When specifications for a product
are altered, the system can automatically ship the most current version to
those who require it.
240
Part III: Going Green 

Specification information system
You can execute detailed searches for specifications and specification data
using the specification information solution. For example, you can use any
substance property as a search criterion. When you run a full-text search, the
system runs through all short and long texts in all relevant languages simulta-
neously. If desired, you can customize the solution to extend the delivered
search functionality. In addition, you can sharpen your results once a hit list
is displayed and then distribute them using the SAP system, Microsoft Excel,
or a browser using HTML format. 
Phrase management
SAP EH&S uses text modules, called phrases, to assign texts to specification
properties. Not only can you manage and translate phrases on demand, but
also you can import commercial phrase libraries and then customize them 
to meet your specific needs. Phrases can be used in all of your documents,
including your reports, MSDSs, labels, and technical data sheets.

Managing the
Flow of
Information

In this part . . .
You discover that when you come right down to it,
GRC is all about the ﬂow of information, both out to
all your stakeholders in the important area of sustainabil-
ity and across the enterprise — literally through its
network pipes and out across the Internet, covered by the
area of IT GRC and data governance. But the most impor-
tant thing that a strong, integrated approach to GRC can
do is improve your visibility into your business in a way
that helps you run your business better and align corpo-
rate performance management (CPM) with GRC efforts.
CPM and GRC are inextricably linked, and you’ll see how
GRC can help you ﬁnd out things you didn’t know before
about your business — key information that can impact
your strategic direction.

Social Responsibility
In This Chapter
 A brief history of sustainability

 Some approaches to automation
S
ustainability, long a mantra of environmentalists, has now firmly entered
the vocabulary of the business world. Simply put, sustainability means
meeting the needs of the present without compromising the needs of the
future.
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) means that companies see the chal-
lenges of sustainability and realize that as a company, they have the responsi-
bility to do something about that. CSR integrates social and environmental
concerns into business operations and relationships with shareholders. Some-
times people refer to this concept as “corporate citizenship” or “corporate
responsibility.” All of these terms carry the same basic meaning: corporations
must worry about more than bottom line profits. Now they must consider
their environmental and social impact. This is often called “triple bottom line
performance.”
What’s the triple bottom line? We’re not going to abandon that first most pop-
ular bottom line (you know, the one about moolah), but now it’s more complex.
The triple bottom line includes three essential elements:
 Profits
 Environmental impact
 Social impact
How is your company going to practice CSR? That’s where corporate sustain-
ability comes in. It’s a management philosophy that meets present goals for
profits and growth without jeopardizing the company’s future — and that

means operating in an environment with more stakeholders, more variables,
and higher expectations.
As we discuss in this chapter, sustainability also makes perfect sense as a
business strategy. It encourages efficiency, good planning, and public good-
will — all key facets of success in an era of globalism. In this chapter, we 
discuss the myriad of advantages to taking a sustainable approach to your
business. We also cover the challenges of sustainability reporting and make
some suggestions for an automated solution.
Discovering the Great Power and
Responsibility of Big Companies
Corporations now have unprecedented economic power. According to Bruce
Piasecki’s book World Inc., 51 of the 100 largest economies in the world are
corporations, not nations. The 100 largest multinational corporations now
control 20 percent of global foreign assets. Only 21 nations have GDP markets
larger than the annual sales revenue of each of the six largest multinational
corporations.
Like Spider-Man says, “With great power, comes great responsibility.” Corp-
orations are expected to act as good global citizens and address social and
environmental concerns that previously had been left to governments and
non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Those that don’t, face a backlash
from consumers, investors, activists, and the media. 
Consider these recent examples:
 In August 2007 Mattel, the world’s largest toy maker, recalled 21 million
toys in the U.S. because the products were covered in lead paint by man-
ufacturers in China or contained magnets that could choke children.
Mattel’s safety checks — which include independent audits of facilities
and ownership of many of its own factories in China — did not prevent
the chain of events that led to the recall. The company’s public image
took a battering, and it faces lawsuits over the dangerous toys.
 Nike suffered worldwide criticism for employing child labor in third
world countries, particularly at soccer ball factories in Pakistan. In 2001,
the company issued its first corporate responsibility report and admit-
ted that it “blew it” when it came to monitoring its production facilities.
Its corporate responsibility report admitted, “Even when records keep-
ing is more advanced, and hiring is carefully done, one mistake can
brand a company like Nike as a purveyor of child labor.”
Critics often portray globalism as freeing corporations from responsibility. In
many ways, however, globalism has increased expectations on the corporation.
246
Part IV: Managing the Flow of Information 

Now corporations must worry about more than pleasing their shareholders;
they must answer to other stakeholders, such as government regulators,
their customers, their employees, and activist groups. Companies that fail to
act as good citizens now face substantial risks. They can squander consumer
goodwill and undermine their own viability. They are accountable to cus-
tomers at home and workers in Asia, Latin America, or Eastern Europe. If the
latter are mistreated, the former may boycott. Similarly, corporations can’t
look at the environment as a local issue. It’s no longer just a question of how
a factory impacts local groundwater; now it must consider how its emissions
might effect global warming.
CSR has become part of big business. More than 1,800 companies in 60 coun-
tries publish sustainability reports that detail nonfinancial areas, such as their
employment in local communities and environmental impacts. About 1,000
companies around the world follow the sustainability reporting guidelines 
of the Global Reporting Initiative. In 2005, the Economist magazine declared,
“Corporate Social Responsibility is now an industry in its own right.” 
Here are just a few examples:
 Automaker Toyota has an “Earth Charter,” a worldwide environmental
policy affecting every aspect of its operations.
 GE, the fifth largest U.S. company, launched its “ecoimagination” campaign
to develop cleaner technologies such as solar energy, hybrid locomotives,
fuel cells, lower emission aircraft engines, lighter and stronger materials,
efficient lighting, and water purification technology. It vowed to reduce its
own emissions by one percent and report publicly on meeting its sustain-
ability goals.
 Interface, a floor covering and fabric manufacturer, has committed itself
towards ambitious goals: eliminating waste, eliminating toxic substances,
and moving toward renewable energy. The company issues an annual
sustainability report following the standards from the Global Reporting
Initiative.
Getting the Lowdown on Sustainability
The idea of sustainability has evolved over the last two decades. The first
major milestone came in 1987 with the World Commission on Environment
and Development. The U.N. created the commission to address growing con-
cern “about the accelerating deterioration of the human environment and
natural resources and the consequences of that deterioration for economic
and social development.” The commission was chaired by former Norwegian
Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland and the report “Our Common Future”
came to be known as “The Brundtland Report.” It established what continues
to be the classic definition of sustainability:
247
Chapter 13: Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility

“Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present
without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.”
This philosophy echoes the “seventh generation” philosophy of the Native
American Iroquois Confederacy, which mandated that chiefs always consider
how their actions would play out seven generations in the future. 
In 1992, 178 governments endorsed the Rio Declaration on Environment and
Development, also known as Agenda 21, an environmental summit in Brazil.
248
Part IV: Managing the Flow of Information 
Sustainability in action: The Wal-Mart effect
Sustainability enhances the bottom line. Just
ask the most notorious cost cutting behemoth
of them all — Wal-Mart. When CEO Lee Scott
took over in 2000, the company faced a series of
PR woes: a class action lawsuit by female
employees, opponents blocking new stores,
criticism for its stingy wages and health bene-
fits, and millions of dollars in fines for violating
air- and water-pollution laws.
The company began a PR counterattack to
polish its image. But then something funny 
happened — it found sustainability made good
business sense too. Wal-Mart discovered that
by eliminating excessive packaging on its Kid
Connection toy line, it could save $2.4 million a
year in shipping costs, 3,800 trees, and one mil-
lion barrels of oil. Wal-Mart determined it could
save $26 million a year in fuel costs for its fleet
of 7,200 trucks merely by installing auxiliary
power units that keep cabs warm or cool while
drivers rest during mandatory ten-hour breaks
from the road. Before that, drivers would let
their engines idle, wasting fuel.
In 2006, Wal-Mart announced plans to invest
$500 million in sustainability. It will double the
efficiency of its vehicle fleet in ten years, reduce
solid waste from US stores by 25 percent in
three years, and cut energy consumption by 30
percent. Its stores also have boosted offerings
of eco-friendly products: It’s the biggest seller
of organic milk and the biggest buyer of organic
cotton in the world.
Wal-Mart operates 14 “sustainable value net-
works,” made up of Wal-Mart executives, sup-
pliers, environmental groups, and regulators that
focus on areas such as facilities, internal oper-
ations, logistics, alternative fuels, packaging,
chemicals, food and agriculture, electronics,
textiles, forest products, jewelry, seafood, and
climate change. The company opened dialogs
with the World Wildlife Federation, the Natural
Resources Defense Council, and Greenpeace.
“Sustainability helped us develop the skills to
listen to people who criticize us and to change
where it’s appropriate,” Scott says.
The company is the biggest private user of elec-
tricity in the US — each of its 2,074 supercenters
uses an average of 1.5 million kilowatts annually.
It also has the nation’s second-largest fleet of
trucks, which travel a billion miles a year. By
Wal-Mart’s own admission, its U.S. operations
were responsible for 15.3 million metric tons of
carbon emissions in 2005 — more than the com-
bined emissions of Bolivia and Cyprus.
But the sheer size of Wal-Mart means that even
small changes have huge reverberations
because its supply chain is so big. The environ-
mental campaign that Scott admits started out as
a “defensive strategy” was, in his view, “turning
out to be precisely the opposite.” Employees felt
better about the company, the company saved
money, and customers did, too. In short, sustain-
ability turned out to be a bottom line strategy, too.

Later that year, the U.N. created the Commission on Sustainable Development
to monitor and report on implementation of the agreements at the local,
national, regional, and international levels.
The U.N. is now working with some of the world’s largest financial institutions,
pension funds, and research firms, representing more than $6 trillion in assets,
to develop environmental, social, and governance (ESG) guidelines that will 
be more transparent to shareholders. These “Principles for Responsible
Investment” include signatories, such as Citigroup, Bank of Tokyo, ABN AMRO,
and hundreds of other financial institutions.
Meanwhile, changes also were afoot in the corporate world. Traditionally,
companies had evaluated their performance on strictly financial measures,
such as accounting figures and stock prices. In the 1980s and 1990s, they
began to realize that their approach was too narrow. They began adopting
new frameworks, such as the balanced scorecard to gain a more holistic and
strategic picture of performance and strategy. New measurement systems
began to include intangibles such as customer satisfaction, employee satis-
faction, and product innovation. Research has shown that more balanced
measurement systems are linked to better business performance. 
Companies began issuing sustainability reports in the 1990s. In 1999, a coali-
tion of activist groups, in cooperation with the United Nations, released the
first sustainability reporting guidelines. This evolved into the Global Reporting
Initiative (GRI). The GRI remains the de facto standard in sustainability
reporting used by organizations in more than 60 countries. In 1990, virtually
no corporations issued non-financial reports. Now more than 1,800 do so.
The concern about sustainability is more than “do-goodism.” Customers and
investors increasingly demand that corporations act as good stewards — a
mandate that companies ignore at their peril. In the U.S., socially responsible
investment firms manage more than $2 trillion in assets. The market has rec-
ognized this ethic with new indexes, such as the Dow Jones Sustainability
Index and FTSE4Good. According to Al Gore, cofounder of the investment
firm Generation, “the full spectrum of value that represents a corporation’s
activities can only be understood if you look outside the narrow confines of
financial reports.”
This area continues to mature rapidly. The U.N. is now working with some of
the world’s largest financial institutions, pension funds, and research firms,
representing more than $6 trillion in assets, to develop ESG guidelines that
will be more transparent to shareholders. New automated solutions are
under development. AMR Research predicts that 89 percent of companies in
the U.S. and 62 percent of companies in Europe are going to invest in IT for
sustainability between 2007 and 2009.
Without a doubt, sustainability is here to stay. But sustainability isn’t just
about doing what’s right: It’s also good for your business. In the next section,
we show you how.

Chapter 13: Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility

Discovering Why Sustainability 
Is Good Business
Businesses cannot operate as they did a generation ago. Until recently, corpo-
rations could operate with the attitude famously summed up by economist
Milton Friedman, “The business of business is business.” Of course, the busi-
ness of business is still business — but the story doesn’t end there. Now they
operate in a more complicated, interconnected global economy. Businesses
must integrate social and environmental concerns into their operations in
order to be successful. In short, they must manage the “triple bottom line.”
In the old fashioned view, the bottom line referred to only economic indicators
like wages, profits or taxes. The new formula recognizes role of social factors
such as investment in the local community, employee benefits or antidiscrim-
ination policies and environmental ones like carbon emissions, the balance of
renewable versus non-renewable energy sources and water consumption. 
Say you’re the CEO of a multinational corporation who’s evaluating perfor-
mance of plants in Latin America. The factory is no longer evaluated purely
on productivity or profitability. Now executives ask new questions: What are
its social investments in the surrounding community? What are its emissions
of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases? What is the ethnic and gender
diversity of the workforce? And how do all these things factor into the overall
enterprise with 50 factories around the world?
Do you think these executives are doing this just to pander to the Sierra Club?
Think again. Nearly three quarters of executives say economic factors are the
leading drivers behind CSR. According to AMR Research, 51 percent of com-
panies with sustainability initiatives reported gains in competitive advantage.
Managers recognize sustainability 
as a top priority
The changing ethos of business is reflected in the 2006 Global Survey of
Business Executives conducted by the prestigious consulting firm McKinsey
and Co. In the survey, only 16 percent of those surveyed said that the sole
role of the corporation was to generate the highest returns. In contrast, 84
percent said companies should balance the quest for profits with contributions
to the broader public good. Yet these same executives said the business world
still hadn’t lived up to the challenge: 70 percent agreed that “significant” or
“substantial” improvements were needed.
250

Why do managers see this as a priority? The KPMG International Survey of
Corporate Responsibility Reporting listed leading drivers of this movement
cited by executives. Figure 13-1 shows the results of the survey.
Several forces are fueling the movement for corporate sustainability manage-
ment. In the next few sections, we examine the most important ones.
Stakeholders exert pressure
In the good old days, a CEO could go about his business while answering to
relatively few stakeholders — namely the board of directors, shareholders,
and customers. Now businesses have far more stakeholders, including cus-
tomers, regulators, NGOs, vendors, competitors, and employees. 
Who exactly is driving sustainability efforts can vary by region across the
globe. One survey by the Economist Intelligent Unit (EIU) asked more than
1,200 executives around the world to name the stakeholders who were most
influential in their sustainability efforts. In Western Europe, the top stakeholder
was the customer (56 percent); in North America, it was the competitors 
(45 percent); and in Asia-Pacific it was government regulators (51 percent).
According to a survey by AMR Research, 27 percent of companies have busi-
ness relationships dependent on their own environmental stance. But this
appears to be scratching the surface: 57 percent expect such relationships to
be dependent on their stance within the next two years. These stakeholders
increasingly demand environmental stewardship and social responsibility.
And they are more proactive about punishing those who fail to meet these

expectations. In 1994, Greenpeace learned that Shell UK was planning to 
dispose of Brent Spar — a 453-foot-tall, 14,500 ton cylindrical oil storage 
facility — by dumping it in the North Sea. Environmentalists cried foul, and
Greenpeace launched a major public relations offensive against the oil com-
pany. Greenpeace activists landed on Brent Spar by boat, occupied the plat-
form for three weeks and generated ongoing news coverage before being
expelled. Shell resorted to high-powered water cannons to keep a Greenpeace
helicopter from approaching Brent Spar — providing more graphic television
images.
Protests and boycotts against Shell broke out across Europe. Even the worker
representatives on Shell Germany’s supervisory board expressed “concern
and outrage” at Shell’s decision to “turn the sea into a trash pit.” The mayor
of Leipzig banned Shell gas in city vehicles. German economics minister
Guenther Rexrodt announced that his ministry would join the boycott. Shell’s
German sales dropped 20 to 30 percent; in some areas they plummeted 40
percent.
Shell’s response was uncoordinated and unfocused. Finally, the company had
little choice but to give in. Shell UK announced that it would abandon plans to
sink the Brent Spar and that it would instead dismantle the platform on land.
The episode proves a stark example of the power of these new stakeholders
in influencing corporations. Some firms have learned to take proactive steps
to reinforce a socially responsible image. British Petroleum (BP) has adopted
such a strategy — at least insofar as an oil company is able to do so. BP has
announced goals to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 10 percent — one of
the first big companies to take such a step. It also has vowed to reduce over-
all air, waste, and water emissions. It has built BP Solar International into one
of the world’s leading manufacturers of solar power generating equipment.
The company signed a $30 million contract with the Philippine government
to install over 1,000 packaged solar systems in 400 remote villages. BP also
promised to eliminate flaring, the burning of natural gas generated in con-
junction with crude oil production and a major source of carbon dioxide
emissions. Chris Rose, deputy executive director of Greenpeace — the very
group that vexed Shell during the Brent Spar episode — called BP one of “the
good guys in this industry.”
Activists increasingly see corporations as agents of social change. Instead of
branding these companies as bogeymen, they often woo them as potential
allies. In many cases, convincing a huge company such as Wal-Mart — with
its giant supply chain and influence over its rivals — to alter its environmental
policies may have a greater impact than lobbying for government regulations.
As a 2007 article in the Financial Times observed, “Suppliers and activist
groups that once dueled over government regulatory standards are battling
instead to win over the Wal-Mart buyers who head its product-focused ‘sus-
tainability networks.’”
252
Part IV: Managing the Flow of Information 

Customers increasingly shop green. One survey commissioned by British
retailer Marks & Spencer shows consumers are thinking more about ethical
and health issues when they buy clothing and food:
 Almost one-third said they had decided not to buy an item of clothing
because they felt concerned about where it had come from or under
what conditions it had been made. 
 Fifty-nine percent said they had also avoided buying a food product due
to similar concerns. 
 Seventy-eight percent said they would like to know more about the way
clothes are made including the conditions in the factories where 
they come from and the use of chemicals in their manufacture.
 Seventy-two percent of food shoppers said they were concerned about
the future of fish stocks.
Think of CSR as a form of compliance. In strict sense, the term compliance
refers to adhering to government regulations. But in broader sense, we can
think of practicing CSR as compliance with stakeholder expectations.
Sustainable businesses have 
better access to capital
Investors and venture capitalists are demanding more sustainability.
Companies that fail to recognize this trend risk losing out on a significant
source of investment in the years ahead. The European Social Investment
Forum (Eurosif) has a mission to “address sustainability through financial
markets.” The group estimates that the efforts will grow to Euro 1.25 billion
by the end of 2006.
The Socially Responsible Investors (SRI) community now wields considerable
clout. Nearly one out of every 10 dollars invested today falls under the cate-
gory of socially responsible investment. These institutional and mutual fund
investors are pushing for greater disclosure and challenging Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles. Shareholder resolutions on social and envi-
ronmental issues increased more than 16 percent from 299 proposals in 2003
to 348 in 2005. Institutional investors that filed or co-filed resolutions on
social or environmental issues controlled nearly $703 billion in assets in 2005,
a 57 percent rise over 2003. 
Failing to live up to these standards can backfire. For example, the FTSE4Good
semi-annual review resulted in the deletion of 17 companies from the index. 
A dozen were ejected for failing to meet environmental criteria, two for failing
to adhere to labor standards in the supply chain, two for failing to meet anti-
bribery standards, and one for owning a weapons company. Each company
was named in the report.
253
Chapter 13: Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility

Government regulations 
increasingly require it
Corporations now operate in a more complicated regulatory environment. In
the U.S., the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was passed in the wake of the Enron collapse
and other corporate scandals. Under Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX), environmental
liabilities and risks are valuated, reported, and financially disclosed. CEOs or
CFOs who fail to abide by Sarbanes-Oxley face severe penalties: up to $5 mil-
lion in fines and/or up to 20 years in prison for willful certification of any
statement not complying with the law.
The U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission is showing an interest in environ-
mental enforcement. The SEC and independent financial auditors scrutinize
environmental financial reporting like never before.
In the European Union, the new REACH guidelines (Registration, Evaluation,
and Authorisation of Chemicals) makes the industry responsible for assess-
ing and managing the risks posed by chemicals and providing appropriate
safety information to users. All manufacturers and importers of chemicals
must identify and manage risks linked to the substances they manufacture
and market and document their actions with a registration dossier, which
must be submitted to the European Chemicals Agency. (See Chapter 12 for
more information on REACH.)
But why just be reactive to regulations? Government regulation is often a
reaction to public pressure. Companies that practice effective sustainability
can anticipate these challenges ahead of time. The trick is to be ahead of the
curve — and that’s what every business wants, right?
Sustainability helps you manage risk
Sustainability is a form of advanced risk management. One 2005 report by
UBS Equity Research concluded that “Social risk is business risk; business
risk translates into financial risk.” 
Corporations are waking up to the fact that costs are not as easily external-
ized as we used to think; selling products with associated health risks may
translate into paying the costs for those health risks at some point in the
future. The litigation that pummeled tobacco and asbestos companies in the
U.S. may be a precursor of what other companies may face in the future.
Nothing like a few multibillion dollar verdicts to change people’s thinking.
More areas of potential big litigation loom on the horizon: Climate change,
pollution, junk food, ozone depletion. The state of California sued six of the
world’s largest auto makers, saying that greenhouse gas emissions from their
vehicles caused billions of dollars in damages.
254
Part IV: Managing the Flow of Information 

The previously mentioned UBS Equity Research study notes that if a firm or
an industry externalizes costs, the price is normally not negotiated at the
time. Instead, the price may be renegotiated at a future date, and sometimes
in a court of law. In other words, you can pay a fixed cost now for CSR or
gamble on paying an unknown cost later — one that may be determined by
trial lawyers and 12 angry men and women. 
CSR protects your brand image
The reputation of the brand is one of the most valuable assets of any company.
Corporations now operate in a globally networked world where information
spreads within minutes. An environmental or social problem in a small village
halfway around the world can influence the attitude of customers at the local
Toys R Us. A hard-earned reputation can be damaged or destroyed in a day. 
Corporations now come under great scrutiny from third-party groups. These
may include environmental groups, human rights organizations, scientific
alliances, and so on. The public is often biased more favorably towards these
groups than corporations. In fact, the public can be downright skeptical
towards big business. When an NGO gets into a dispute with a corporation,
the burden of proof usually falls to the corporation. 
CSR is a means to protect brand image. It shows the world you want to be a
responsible citizen. When problems do arise, it shows you will correct them
quickly and decisively and own up to your mistakes. 
Transparency has become a powerful brand differentiator and marketing
tactic. British food retailer Marks & Spencer launched a major campaign
called “look behind the label” to tell customers about how its products are
sourced and made. For example, a package of crackers might list its environ-
mental footprint, with CO2 emissions, along with nutritional information.
Such proactive tactics have generated many positive news items, according
to an analysis by the Geneva-based ethical reputation research firm
Covalence.
Two-thirds of chief financial officers at leading U.S. retailers say their com-
pany is actively involved with “green” or environmentally friendly practices,
according to a new study by BDO Seidman, LLP. Among the 100 largest retail-
ers, 83 percent are involved in green practices and 62 percent have increased
their green investments during the past two years. When asked to identify
the greatest motivator for this change, two-thirds of the CFOs cited the com-
pany’s corporate image among consumers and shareholders. Tax breaks or
tax incentives were only cited by 15 percent of the CFOs. In other words,
brand image proved a much greater motivator than government policy.
255
Chapter 13: Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility

It helps you attract and 
keep the best employees
Today corporations compete for the best workforce. Many people, especially
those from younger generations, want more than just a high salary; they also
want to feel good about their company. They want to work for an enterprise
that makes meaningful contributions to the world. Your cafeteria food may 
be great, but if the news is full of reports about your company causing birth
defects in the Third World, your employees are not going to have warm feel-
ings about their employers.
Companies have become social institutions in their own right and they are
accountable to their own employees. CSR shows the world you want to be a
good global citizen and this helps recruitment and employee satisfaction, 
and lessens absenteeism and turnover.
CSR is ethical
Business leaders are just like the rest of us: They have moral values. In the
KPMG International Survey of Corporate Responsibility Reporting, ethical
considerations were cited by 53 percent of executives cited ethical considera-
tions as the number two factor behind their sustainability initiatives, second
only to economic considerations.
Take the example of Novo Nordisk. Like many western companies, it does
business in China. But it also has taken on a pressing health problem — even
though it may limit future growth. In China, diabetes is growing at a faster
rate than the rest of the world due to the transition to a Western diet and
lifestyle. Novo Nordisk has 60 percent of the Chinese market for insulin. If
they succeed in reducing the effects of diabetes through education, presum-
ably sales of insulin will not increase at the current rate. Yet the company
believes that it’s better to do the right thing rather than just seek profits. To
that end, they’re investing considerable effort into diabetes education, both
for the public and for healthcare professionals.
It helps business planning and innovation
Sustainability reporting does more than assuage external stakeholders; it’s
also a management tool. It opens new windows into your operations. Imagine
that your company wants to expand overseas production and is considering
whether to invest in a factory in India and another in China. Sustainability
reporting gives you an auditable database with benchmarks for examining
256
Part IV: Managing the Flow of Information 

key questions. How do the two factories compare in emissions of greenhouse
gases? How about employee turnover? Investment in workers? Managers can
get a fuller picture and make wiser decisions.
CSR increases profits
Finally, let’s not forget the good old bottom line: profits. In the KPMG Inter-
national Survey of Corporate Responsibility Reporting, economic factors
were listed as the top driver behind this movement. 
Sustainability helps companies reduce inefficiency and minimize lost profits.
Saving resources and energy means reducing costs for both procurement and
waste at the same time. Improvements in environmental, health, and safety
measures have a real payoff: fewer accidents, fewer lost workdays, and fewer
fines. Environmentally sound products gain more market share and earn
more profits. Balancing social, environmental, and economic considerations
contributes to long-term prosperity. 
Sustainability management is good management. Pharmaceutical companies
receiving above average EcoValue21(r) ratings have outperformed companies
with below average ratings by approximately 17 percentage points (1700
basis points) since May 2001. 
Similarly, a report by the Economist Intelligence Unit found a strong correla-
tion between sustainability efforts and profits: Companies that rated their
sustainability efforts most highly saw annual profit increases of 16 percent
and share price growth of 45 percent. Those that ranked their own efforts
poorly saw profits grow by only 7 percent and share price by 12 percent.
Business is still about the bottom line, but now there are three of them: profit,
environmental impact, and social impact. Nearly 70 percent of chief execu-
tives of mid-sized to large companies believe that sustainability is vital to
their profitability, and more than two-thirds say it will remain a high priority,
according to recent global client surveys by Price Waterhouse Coopers. The
business of business is still business — it just has to operate in a new climate.
Sustainability is about adapting to a changing world. And, like Darwin told us,
the ones who adapt best survive, and the ones who don’t become extinct.
Consumers reward companies whose CSR programs:
 Have a good fit with the business mission and strategy.
 Demonstrate proactive versus reactive timing (regardless of whether
motivation is profit or altruism).
 Make solid business sense. Sustainability is not about charity. If it is not
good business, consumers are skeptical.
257
Chapter 13: Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility

Discovering the Possible 
Downside of CSR
Still, sustainability has its share of skeptics in the business world. They point
to a lack of empirical evidence of its effectiveness. Indeed, many of the argu-
ments in its favor are theoretical and anecdotal. It’s difficult to measure con-
structs, such as brand value or corporate reputation and tie them to
sustainability initiatives.
In addition, costs are easily quantifiable whereas benefits of sustainability are
more elusive. You look at the budget and see you invested $1 million on sus-
tainability, but how does one measure the payoff in customer loyalty? More-
over, the benefits of sustainability initiatives often appear after a time lag.
Companies that take a purely pragmatic approach may focus excessively 
on the downside of such initiatives — their cost — and underestimate their
benefits.
Even worse, sustainability can backfire if not implemented wisely. If you’ve
billed yourself as a green company and then get exposed for violating your
own standards, you’ll be branded as a hypocrite. The Center for Responsible
Business at the University of California at Berkeley found that when social ini-
tiatives are not aligned with corporate objectives, CSR can “actually become
a liability and diminish previously held beliefs about firms.” Reporting must
withstand the scrutiny of being audited. Under the watchful eyes of stake-
holders around the world, corporations need to prove that their reporting is
more than whitewash or — as it’s known within environmental circles —
greenwash. 
Managing Sustainability Performance
After you’ve decided that sustainability is worthwhile, now comes the tough
part: actually doing it. Unfortunately, managing corporate sustainability is
largely a work in progress and standards and measures continue to evolve.
These methods are still manual, time consuming, inefficient, and costly.
Worse, the information gathered and reported often is not transparent or
auditable. In short, these practices simply are not sustainable.
Sustainability is a global trend, but not a uniform one. Part of this rests on
confusion about the meaning of sustainability itself. Businesses often are con-
fused by new demands. They have trouble devising sustainability targets and
aligning social and environmental objectives with financial ones. In the afore-
mentioned EIU survey of more than 1,200 executives, only 53 percent of com-
panies claimed to have a sustainability policy in place — and only half of
those extended it beyond internal operations into their supply chains.
258
Part IV: Managing the Flow of Information 

The current reporting process is a mess
Many companies borrow from templates, such as the Global Reporting
Initiative. Yet standards vary and reports are often lean and labor intensive.
In the EIU survey, only 22 percent of executives said their companies had
formal procedures for triple bottom line reporting (although 40 percent
planned to adopt them within the next five years).
Common problems with sustainability reporting include
 Information flows sequentially, and there are technical obstacles for
each step. 
 The whole process relies on manual operations. Information is typically
exchanged by e-mail. Data is stored in Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.
Validation and consolidation require considerable effort and time. The
whole process is prone to errors. 
 Whole teams spend weeks or months gathering the data, making sure
that it’s correct and consolidating it. Because this whole process is
based on manual operations, many companies invest in third party
assurance by hiring expensive auditing companies. Costs can reach 
two million euros per an annual report.
 Sustainability solutions often aren’t integrated into other existing systems.
According to a survey of 150 companies in the U.S. and Europe by AMR
Research, less than one-third use their ERP systems to help manage CSR
issues. Yet these enterprise-wide systems should be the very foundation
of balancing environmental, social, and business objectives.
New tactics are required
Companies must move from reactive, uncoordinated tactics to proactive strat-
egy. In other words, you must embed sustainability into your key business
processes. Sustainable development then becomes a natural part of business
development.
The benefits of such a shift include
 Competitive advantage. Sustainability monitoring can be cumbersome
and time consuming. By doing it efficiently, you gain competitive advan-
tage over rivals
 Long-term success. This depends not only on financial performance, but
also on performance of non-financials, for instance, energy efficiency,
carbon footprint, toxic substances in products, etc. 
 Improved internal and external benchmarking. You gain more insight into
your sustainability performance. This allows you to feed back information
259
Chapter 13: Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility

from internal or external benchmarks into your strategy management to
help you identify opportunities to improve your business.
 Better informed investment decisions 
 Reduced financial risk, stemming from reducing environmental and
health risks
 Speed. Reporting requirements would be fulfilled more quickly
 Flexibility. An automated solution meets immediate needs and remains
adaptable to future ones.
Discovering Why an Automated 
Solution Is Needed
The problem of manual, cumbersome sustainability reporting requires an
automated solution, and, the AMR study cited earlier indicates that the
market recognizes this as well, with the majority of companies in the US 
and in the EU planning to invest in IT for sustainability between 2007 and
2009. In the next few sections, we explore some of the reasons an IT solution
is needed.
Sustainability reporting 
is a recurring problem
Sustainability reporting is becoming an increasingly important part of doing
business. As it becomes more institutionalized, reporting requirements will
only increase. Companies need a solution that doesn’t have to be reinvented
again and again. 
Companies are regularly asked for sustainability data by various parties: their
own executives, the press, NGOs, interest groups, and regulators. Under a
manual system, this information must be calculated again and again. With 
an automated system, data is always up to date and can be gathered and 
customized with a few clicks.
Huge amounts of data are involved
Sustainability reporting is complex and undoubtedly will become even more
so in the years ahead. It’s simply impractical to manage so much data without
a comprehensive solution. A solution must work across different business
260
Part IV: Managing the Flow of Information 

applications and must be able to draw data from systems of record. An inte-
grated suite is critical.
Integration is a plus
A successful solution must integrate various back end systems. Such a solution
leverages existing IT investments and builds upon existing infrastructure.
Sustainability cannot be viewed in isolation. To the contrary, it must be
absorbed into the very heart of the enterprise. For example, sustainability 
is closely tied to risk management, governance, compliance, financials, and
supply chain management, and thus should be integrated with all relevant
software applications to ease sustainability metrics and reporting.
Such a solution would automatically pull relevant information from other 
systems of record. This would save the trouble of repeatedly hunting down
bits of data and entering them manually. It also would be more efficient than
building an entirely new system from scratch, which only introduces redun-
dancy into the organization and creates problems with integration. 
Key performance indicators could be displayed in some kind of dashboard or
portal to give managers a quick snapshot. Managers could rest assured that
they have an accurate picture that uses their best and most current data
from other enterprise software.
Automation creates supply 
chain transparency
An automated solution helps solve one of the most vexing problems of sus-
tainability efforts: the integrity of the supply chain. The supply chain is often
a weak link in sustainability. In the Economist Intelligence Unit survey, about
one fifth of executives admitted their company has performed poorly in set-
ting standards for suppliers in environmental and human rights issues.
Companies are being held accountable for problems in their supply chain —
even when they are not directly responsible. For example, Mattel took a
public beating when suppliers in China used lead paint on toys. In the mind
of the consumer, it matters little where the problem originated; the buck
stops with the name of the brand they see on the shelf.
Clearly, companies need more control over their own supply chains. This
task has grown more complex in the era of globalism, when supply chains
can stretch thousands of miles and involve hundreds of partners. Companies
261
Chapter 13: Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility

need sustainability software that interfaces with that of their suppliers. Ideally,
a solution would “plug in” to the systems of supply chain partners. This
would make the entire supply chain more transparent, which is something
stakeholders have come to expect.
Automation means auditability
Companies are starting to require that their suppliers adhere to their sustain-
ability requirements. In addition, the U.N. Global Compact and industry codes
of conduct require members to ensure that suppliers are compliant. Currently
this manual process involves a hodge-podge of emails, surveys, on site
audits, and so on. A value chain sustainability application would analyze the
requirements of, for example, regulations, industry groups or customers, and
automate the audit, documentation, and response process. It would provide
key performance indicators on sustainability programs and show what rev-
enue is “at risk” by poor supply sustainability management.
For example, Wal-Mart has unveiled a “Sustainability 360” plan and has set a
goal of one day using only renewable energy and creating no waste — and the
giant retailer has challenged its suppliers, customers, and employees to do
the same.
In 2007, Wal-Mart announced it will ask suppliers to measure and report
greenhouse gas emissions incurred in the making of certain products. The
company will start with a pilot group of about 30 manufacturers of seven
common products, including toothpaste, soap, beer, milk, and DVDs. Wal-
Mart plans to eventually widen the project to include about 68,000 suppliers.
The move is part of an overall strategy that forces manufacturers and suppli-
ers to comply with Wal-Mart standards or risk losing contracts. “This is an
important first step toward reaching our goal of removing nonrenewable
energy from products that Wal-Mart sells,” John Fleming, Wal-Mart’s chief
merchandising officer, said in a statement.
Automation yields analytics 
and benchmarks
An IT solution provides a scorecard that can be tailored to many uses. Data
can be customized for specific stakeholders or user groups. Value and units
of measure could be converted from euros to dollars or kilos to pounds.
Reporting units could be customized; an airline could compare plane types 
in terms of their environmental impact while a keyboard manufacturer could
compare all its various types of keyboards in terms of the environmental
impact of their component parts.
262
Part IV: Managing the Flow of Information 

Consider a greenhouse gas management application. Many companies grap-
ple with the problem of trying to quantify their carbon footprint. Such an
application would automate the process by analyzing both the company’s
own direct “smokestack” emissions and indirect emissions from sources,
such as travel, buildings, supply chain, and partners. Such an application
could integrate ERP/manufacturing applications, sourcing, supply chain, and
human resources. Executives could analyze key questions such as the poten-
tial for global warming or ozone depletion. They could compare performance
in plants across the globe, drilling down and slicing data however they choose.
Features of a greenhouse gas management application could include:
 Changing query display options with one-click navigation. Change sort-
ing, swap axes, change aggregation methods (sums, average) or change
the display (ranked list, Olympic, cumulated. . .)
 Performance management
 Trend analysis
 Data mining
 Benchmarking
An IT solution speeds distribution of data
Different business regulations, complicated by regional differences, require
access to information across disparate enterprise systems. An IT solution
builds upon an integrated business applications environment that is cross-
enterprise, and spans regional issues, business mandates, and industry 
regulations.

IT GRC
In This Chapter
 Figuring out IT GRC in terms of risk and compliance
 Securing software applications
 Protecting corporate assets
S
o far, this book has been a general argument for instituting a Governance,
Risk and Compliance regimen within your organization. In this chapter,
we discuss the very significant role that IT plays in supporting and managing
GRC efforts. IT must be appropriately monitored and up to the task at hand in
order for the system to function and to comply with regulations, such as SOX.
What you don’t know about IT GRC can and will come and bite you in the
tuckus. Why? SOX and other regulatory initiatives, both financial and opera-
tional, have set responsibility for protecting the integrity of financial report-
ing on the shoulders of CEOs and directors, which we are sure is something
you have heard ad nauseam.
The reality of this situation is that companies have had to initiate a host of
policies, procedures, and internal controls to live up to that mandate. And
although corporate officers cannot be expected to know every iota of detail
about what is going on under the hood, they must have a depth of under-
standing of the efficiency of the company’s internal controls, policies, and
procedures in order to competently certify the company’s financial reporting.
Simply saying, “Hey, we got IT all over the place” is not going to be enough if
federal regulators and auditors come sniffing around the front door. To meet
the requirement that you “competently certify the company’s financial
reporting,” not to mention live up to a whole host of other regulations, such
as those requiring data privacy, you must have effective controls in place,
which means effective use of IT and policies surrounding technology. In this
chapter, we cover the many tools you can use to protect data and secure IT
assets.

As with most GRC issues, with IT GRC, it makes sense to take an enterprisewide
and integrated approach. However, managing risk and compliance issues has
generally been made more difficult by the past tendency of companies to
implement iterative and fragmented approaches to GRC, which in turn has led
to fragmentation within the IT systems and infrastructure used to support GRC.
Further, compliance and risk have become more complex as customers and
suppliers seek to hold businesses more accountable in how those relationships
are carried out. An IT system must be able to handle this degree of complexity.
Getting a Handle on What IT GRC Is
Essentially, IT GRC encompasses the technical tools (software and hardware)
and related policies and procedures used to support compliance and risk
management efforts from an IT perspective based on established best

Learned Hand: One man’s control 
is another’s negligence
A good question to ask yourself is, “I have poli-
cies and IT related controls in place, but are they
enough to satisfy regulators and auditors if
something goes wrong?” To answer that ques-
tion, we need go no farther than one of the U.S.’s
most celebrated and aptly named jurists —
Learned Hand. 
Learned Hand never made it to The Show — the
Supreme Court of the United States — but he did
make it as far as chief judge for the United States
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, where
he made two rulings he is now famous for.
The first relates to establishing negligence in a
legal context. In the United States v. Carroll
Towing, Hand established what is known as the
“calculus of negligence,” which, to paraphrase,
says that if you can create benefits or mitiga-
tions at a low cost as compared to the amount
of risk and its likelihood of occurring, and you
don’t, then you are negligent.
For example, if you operate a public storage
warehouse, installing smoke detectors and a
sprinkler system is a good way to respond to the
risk of fire and avoid being sued for negligence.
As this relates to technology, most Internet ser-
vice providers include spyware and antivirus
protections as a means to reduce risk and avoid
being accused of negligence. For a corporate
CEO, maintaining a strong, proactive and enter-
prisewide GRC system is one way to live up to
Hand’s calculus of negligence should something

making noises.
(Wondering about that second ruling Judge
Hand made? It is indeed unrelated, so forgive
the digression. The government had accused
one taxpayer of avoiding taxes because this
wily fellow used the tax code to his advantage
to avoid paying as much taxes as he could.
Hand ruled that it is not up to taxpayers to pay
as much as they can, but that it is their right to
pay as little as they can as long as they are fol-

practices. Specifically, Gartner, an IT research and advisory company, issued
a report by Mark Nicolett and Paul E. Proctor in May of 2007 that delineates
eight core IT GRC functions:
 Controls and policy mapping: IT controls and policies should be
mapped into defined control objectives.
 Policy distribution and attestation: Policies should be broadly dissemi-
nated throughout the enterprise with a means for employees to attest
that they have read them and will comply.
 IT control self-assessment and measurement: Assess your use of IT con-
trols and collect data so that you can measure exactly how well you are
doing and can note improvements over time.
 GRC asset repository: IT assets should be defined and grouped accord-
ing to the business process they support and classified according to
requirements for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
 Automated general computer control collection: Essentially the status
of computer controls can be collected from the source in an automated
fashion.
 Remediation and exception management: Show where there were gaps
in your process or problems (exceptions) and document how you
addressed them so that you can show this information to auditors.
 Basic compliance reporting: Integrate compliance data in a form that is
acceptable to auditors
 Advanced IT risk evaluation and compliance dashboarding: This helps
the business make good decisions based on IT risk management and
compliance information.
What Gartner is essentially saying is that IT GRC is about defining IT policies,
processes, and controls so that they are based on best practices; making sure
these policies are widely known throughout the enterprise; mapping the poli-
cies to technical controls; evaluating compliance issues and the risk of being
noncompliant; and then automating the audit and regulatory reporting of
your company’s efforts.
Understanding IT Governance in 
Terms of Risk and Compliance
Simply put, IT governance is about how a company manages its IT landscape.
It is governance directly tied to IT topics, so it involves fashioning IT policies
and procedures that the company establishes in order to govern itself from a
risk and compliance perspective.
267
Chapter 14: IT GRC

Further, IT governance is aligned with the overall enterprise governance
strategy so that every employee and every process complies with prescribed
IT policies. Examples could be password policies and rules around how pass-
words are used, mandatory IT training, rules for e-mail usage, IT governance
related documentation, and so on.
In terms of risk
When it comes to risk, IT GRC is fairly straightforward. It essentially deals
with how to set policies and procedures that minimize risks to the network,
applications, and data.
Information security involves ensuring the integrity and privacy of corporate
data. So naturally IT GRC must ensure that adequate security measures are in
place to protect information both from internal and external attack (as well
as snafus resulting from plain old human error). But there are other consider-
ations as well.
Suppose that the company is going to do an upgrade to the system that gen-
erates financial reports. In this instance, what are the documented policies
and procedures for backing up the existing system? Who is in charge of
checking the various components of the system? And who is testing — and
what pieces are they testing — to make sure the components are actually
going to support the business needs the system is designed to address?
Then there is the area of disaster recovery. Katrina is the oft- and overused
example of this kind of thing, but when the hurricane struck it put every
worst-case IT risk scenario to the test. Those companies that were prepared
managed to recover because they understood the need to have disaster
recovery systems in place that could mitigate the impact of a hurricane 
hitting the Gulf Coast.
The threat doesn’t necessarily have to be a large-scale catastrophe, such as
Katrina. A heavy snowfall, rain causing a roof to collapse, or a mouse chewing
on some wires causing a fire are all examples of possible disasters. In either
event, the company that has considered its IT risks and established the
means to respond to them will survive both the immense hurricane and 
the tiny mouse.
Your disaster recovery plan needs to include not only your company’s physi-
cal location, but also that of your backup site. For example, say that your
company is located in an area that is geologically secure, far enough north 
to avoid hurricanes, and far enough south to never have more than a gentle
sprinkling of rain or dusting of snow. However, if it is using an offsite vendor
to back up data or has located its data recovery center in another geographic
region, what are the policies for managing a storm or fire or some other event
268
Part IV: Managing the Flow of Information 

that could threaten that data? Also, has there been a study to measure the
risk associated with that site as compared with others?
If a vendor is responsible for managing data, is there a system of accountability
for what happens if an incident occurs? An example could be stipulations —
such as penalties or assurances — dealing directly with such issues in a ser-
vice level agreement.
Other risks that require policies in order to deal with the potential for such a
scenario playing out include loss of intellectual property, leaking of customer
information, and more. We discuss these issues in greater detail later in the
chapter, but the larger point here is that governance as it concerns risk is
about ensuring business continuity and mitigation of financial risks based on
and with regard to the IT resources of the company.
In terms of compliance
If your company operates across state and national boundaries, or it hopes
to one day do so, compliance extends far beyond SOX or even HIPAA (the
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act). Here’s a quick rundown
of some of the data privacy regulations around the world. Remember that, to
date, the U.S. takes this topic less seriously than other regions:
 Europe: The European Data Protection Directive, which has shaped leg-
islation in each member country 
 Canada: Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act
 Japan: Personal Information Privacy Act
States within the U.S. are also getting into the act to shore up protections
they may feel the federal government is moving too slowly on. For example,
according to the Data Governance Institute (DGI), the California Security
Breach Information Act requires state agencies, nonprofit institutions, and
companies, regardless of geographic location, to notify their California 
customers if personal information maintained in digital format has been 
compromised. (The DGI is a very good resource for those interested in 
learning more on IT compliance issues. For more info, see their Web site
www.datagovernance.com).
The California Security Breach Information Act means that if you do business
via the Internet on your Web site hosted in, say, Massachusetts and you collect
shipping addresses and credit card information in order to send and process
orders and you believe that your security was compromised, you have to
notify each customer in California who may have been affected. Simply placing
an ad in the newspaper is not enough. California is not the only state with such
a law — Arkansas, Connecticut, New York, Delaware, and many others have
passed their own versions.
269
Chapter 14: IT GRC

There is no doubt, then, that the scope of managing compliance as it relates
to your IT systems is a rather daunting task. This is where the control frame-
works come into play, including COBIT and COSO (see the next two sections).
These control frameworks provide an outline of the issues you need to look
at, as well as providing some nice four- and five-letter acronyms for you to
add to your alphabet soup.
COBIT
Published by the IT Governance Institute and the Information Systems Audit
and Control Association (ISACA), COBIT (Control Objectives for Information
and Related Technologies) is an open source standard that provides an IT
governance framework to manage risk and compliance issues based on best
practices.
According to ISACA, the bottom-line function for IT is to support the business
goals for the company. To do that, COBIT supports an IT governance frame-
work that helps a company make sure that its IT systems are aligned with 
the business, that IT enables the business and maximizes IT’s benefits to the
business, that IT resources are used responsibly, and IT risks are managed
appropriately. For more information, go to the ISACA Web site at www.
isaca.org.
COSO
The full name for COSO (www.coso.org) is the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and it is a voluntary private
sector organization dedicated to improving the quality of financial reporting
through business ethics, effective internal controls, and corporate governance.
As such, the organization has created an internal control framework known
as the COSOS-Enterprise Risk Management Framework. According to a COSO
publication titled “Enterprise Risk Management — Integrated Framework:
Executive Summary,” the framework is based on eight interrelated compo-
nents by which to evaluate the company’s risk management strategy:
 Internal Environment
 Objective Setting
 Event Identification
 Risk Assessment
 Risk Response
 Control Activities
 Information & Communication
 Monitoring
270
Part IV: Managing the Flow of Information 

However, COBIT and COSO, while they are helpful, have something of a one-
size-fits-all feel to them and may not be specific enough to get your company
to its desired scenario, ensuring that all is well under the hood.
Therefore, to augment these frameworks, it is advisable to bring in an inde-
pendent auditor to identify critical transactions and examine whether the
company has the right controls around those from an IT perspective.
The frameworks may be too generic to rely on entirely, but if your company
has a breach of security, you would at least be in a position to say that you
have a documented structure in place: You have performed due diligence.
Further, these frameworks can serve as an organizing principle around which
you can develop your compliance initiatives, ensuring that all the bases are
covered.
Keeping up with the pace of change
A properly functioning IT governance framework recognizes the constantly
changing nature of IT. Such a framework would frequently evaluate current
processes against a changing landscape — new threats, risks, laws, and
evolving technologies in order to keep the calculus of negligence tilted in
your favor.
Your company may have come up with a better mouse trap five years ago, but
unfortunately the mouse has gotten a lot bigger and a heck of a lot smarter.
Within the brief evolutionary cycle of risk and compliance, it is very easy to
neglect to recognize the true threat posed by the mouse and adequately
adapt your systems.
Perspective is key, and one of the best ways to gain a good perspective is to
look outside of your company to experts that can help you see with clarity
what your industry expects, what your customers and vendors expect of you,
and what regulatory agencies expect of you. Challenging your own assump-
tions about how up-to-date and correct your systems are may require looking
to an auditor to gain much needed perspective.
If you do this due diligence, in a pinch, you will be able to look at the norms
and exceptions (for example, the tolerances and when you may have exceeded
them) for your spend management systems and clearly declare whether your
reporting is complete, accurate, and valid as measured against the industry
and aligned with the company’s risk and compliance profile. 
271
Chapter 14: IT GRC

Securing Your Software Applications
Applications are software that is designed to perform some meaningful func-
tion. For a company, application software could be any one of the enterprise
systems such as enterprise resource planning, supply chain management, or
customer relationship management, or the databases that maintain informa-
tion on everything from products to customers to the financial transactions
of the company.
Therefore, application security directly relates to making sure those assets
perform properly and are not vulnerable to attack by hackers or misused
internally by employees. 
Generally, application security has been widely recognized as a good thing
that everybody must have, but it has also commonly been interpreted as
solely the province of the IT department. With the passage of SOX (yes, we
know, more about SOX), CEOs and directors are more accountable than ever
for what goes on under the hood of their companies, so ignoring application
security comes with a significant set of perils. Simply put, IT may run and
manage this function, but the CEO needs to understand what they are doing
and how they are doing it.
Taking basic application 
security measures
The tools of application security are the same kinds of controls used in nearly
every other aspect of GRC: software, hardware, and guidelines establishing
set policies and procedures for employees to follow. Further, because of the
recognized risk of being hacked, application developers are building security
measures into their software, and application security should be an evalua-
tion point for software purchases.
Some of the most basic and elemental application security measures are
items that have reached a high degree of ubiquity throughout society, such
as firewalls, anti-virus software, and anti-spyware software. Routers can also
get into the act by making sure that internal IP addresses can be hidden and
ensuring that packets with internal IP addresses do not come into the firewall
from the outside (an attack technique called IP spoofing). Other measures
can include encryption of information as it travels from one point to another
or biometric authentication tools that ensure the user is certified to access
certain data or use a particular piece of hardware.
Application security can be enhanced through a practice known as threat
modeling, which can include a wide range of possible scenarios such as a 
failure of the application to operate properly, a malicious action taken by an
272
Part IV: Managing the Flow of Information 

internal or external player, or some other form of attack that either exposes
the data held by the application, allows unauthorized individuals to use the
application, or crashes it.
As with the governing frameworks discussed above, companies need to
assess their unique risk and compliance needs when establishing a threat
model, but here are some general rules of the road as a starting point:
 Understand the business objectives the application is used to support.
After all, spend management applications fulfill different roles from 
customer relationship management.
 Determine who uses the application and the roles those people are 
performing.
 Know in a fairly precise sense the data used by the application and place
a value on that data. Is it a database with credit card numbers or is it
inventory control software?
 Understand when the application is used. Does it manage vendor pay-
ments or keep track of the number of SKUs held in a warehouse?
 Precisely understand how the application works. What are its mechanics?
 Use the above information to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities.
 Assess the likelihood of the identified threats and the potential impact
to the company (financial, brand, compliance).
 Create procedures and policies around responses to potential threat
scenarios.
 Consider the words of Learned Hand and install or create appropriate
counter measures to protect the applications from the threats. (For
more on the aptly named jurist, see the “Learned Hand: One man’s con-
trol is another’s negligence” sidebar elsewhere in this chapter.)
 As with every recipe in this book, stir in a rounded cup of regularly-
update-all-of-the-above.
Consolidating security solutions
Obviously the level and number of possible threats and risks to your applica-
tions has grown over the years. First it was hackers, then along came 
viruses, followed by spyware, and on and on. In addition, with each 
iteration, your company wisely thought it prudent to integrate some form of
countermeasures — such as firewalls, anti-virus software, and so on — and
then policies to enhance the technical countermeasures — such as “Don’t
open e-mail attachments from unidentified or unknown sources.” In addition,
each of these was targeted toward a specific and/or emerging threat.
273
Chapter 14: IT GRC

Over the years, these countermeasures and policies have accumulated. Some
are still in use even as the company seeks the next best mousetrap and
others have been cast aside as their utility faded or they were replaced by
something else.
These various solutions have likely worked fairly well at keeping the com-
pany’s applications and network safe from various threats. However, as you
seek to gain a better idea of your inventory and start poking around the
garage, the basement, and the attic, you may begin to realize that your 
application security tools and policies lack a common approach or oversight.
Therefore, it is important to take a look and see if this is true for your com-
pany and if so, implement a plan to bring uniformity to the company’s
approach based on accepted best practices.
Consolidating the IT infrastructure makes sense, particularly for global com-
panies. For example, IBM is consolidating its back office functions and moving
them into global regions — procurement in China, service delivery in India —
and building shared service centers and centers of excellence as a way to
improve efficiencies and develop new products and services. To do all this,
IBM overhauled its management culture. By consolidating these functions,
they can be optimized so that they cost less and also more consistently man-
aged. Managing compliance in one location is obviously much more efficient
than managing it in many locations around the world. 
Making friends with the IT department
As you begin to look at the various frameworks upon which the company
could build its own system, dig into threat modeling, and consider how to
defragment your security assets and policies, it’s also a good time to bridge
what can often be a rather large gap between the IT and business sides of the
business. The following points, taken from “New Era of Corporate Governance:
Application Security Implications of Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Proposals
to Securities and Exchange Commission,” by Gary Dickhart, should help by
providing a starting point for those efforts:
 Make sure that there is a process to facilitate knowledge sharing
between the business and IT sides
 Simplify technical information so that it is accessible to non-IT personnel
 Application security counter measures — policies and technical tools —
should be a part of daily life for managers
 People close to the daily operations of the company should handle 
security-related activities in order to best monitor trends
 Align all processes, policies, and countermeasures with best practices
274
Part IV: Managing the Flow of Information 

 The board and CEO should integrate policies, processes and counter
measures into a unified approach covering physical security, information
security, information privacy, fraud detection, a means for employees to
report issues, and ethics training.
Keeping the Kimono Closed: Data Privacy
If there was a hit parade of IT GRC issues, data privacy would top the charts.
It has become a hot area for government regulation and has received an
immense amount of media attention, which means it is being considered
beyond business circles and is generally out in the public consciousness. In
fact, public awareness of the risk of identity theft has sparked increased use
of shredders at home, firewalls on personal computers, as well as a whole
host of other counter measures to protect private information.
Public policy setters, being the keen observers that they are, have been busy
looking for ways to enforce the public’s wish that government agencies, 
nonprofits, and the business community take steps to protect all forms of
information.
HIPAA (the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) is but one
example of efforts to hold organizations accountable for protecting private
information. Not only does the law protect health information, but billing
information as well. Further, national standards have been set for maintaining
the security of this information, which specify a series of administrative,
technical, and physical security procedures to assure the confidentiality of
health information stored electronically.
HIPAA is but one example of laws requiring organizations to take steps to
assure the integrity of their information systems in order to protect con-
sumers’ e-mail addresses, Social Security numbers, contact information,
credit card numbers, bank account numbers, and on and on.
With the attention this one issue has received by the media, there is also 
a certain amount of corporate peer pressure being applied. Consider for a
moment the hit your brand and reputation would take if it were to become
public knowledge that someone lost a laptop with thousands of credit card
numbers.
Generally speaking, protecting this information has landed on the CIO’s desk
because this role is responsible for and has direct jurisdiction over digital
assets. However, accountability, unlike water, generally flows up, so it is
important for business side executives and board members to take an active
interest in the measures being taken to secure data.
275
Chapter 14: IT GRC

Protecting Key Corporate Assets:
Intellectual Property
What if your company loses a laptop holding proprietary information, such
as CAD drawings of your next big idea or other forms of intellectual property?
The key to your success as a company is typically associated with protecting
key corporate assets and those assets are at least in part digital (if you are a
software company, they may be entirely digital). This is not strictly about
data privacy, but it is about data protection: keeping information from falling
into the wrong hands.
Cinching up the kimono
So, how is a company supposed to manage all of its information? Digitally
mark every bit of proprietary information? Digital signatures? Watermarking?
276
Part IV: Managing the Flow of Information 
Protecting employee information: Data loss at HP
In August 2006, Computerworld reported on the
results of a survey conducted by Ponemon
Institute LLC and Vontu Inc., a San Francisco-
based provider of data loss prevention prod-
ucts. The survey concluded that 81 percent of
reporting companies had experienced a theft or
loss of sensitive employee information — items
such as names, addresses, and social security
numbers. In most cases, the sensitive data was
on company laptops that had been stolen or
gone missing. One company that experienced
such a loss was HP.
In HP’s case, the laptop in this case was owned
by Fidelity. It contained data on approximately
200,000 HP employees and was to be used to
showcase new software that Fidelity said would
help HP in certain administrative tasks related to
HP’s retirement plan. According to an article in
the Register, Fidelity didn’t brief HP beforehand
that the data was to be used to showcase the
software in question. But the Register went on to
say that the loss of the laptop was, according to
HP, due to “human error.” Was the “human
error” a case of an employee leaving the laptop
unattended, thereby resulting in its theft? 
How did such an error occur, and who was
responsible for the loss of Fidelity’s laptop? 
These questions raise issues of oversight and
accountability, especially at Fidelity. A March
2006 CNet article mentions that no abuses of the
employee information had thus far occurred,
and that employee PIN numbers for the Fidelity
accounts were not part of the missing data. This
would seem to indicate that the accounts
wouldn’t be easily breached by anyone with
malicious intentions. 
So many companies report a loss of employee
data (81 percent as cited earlier) that this IT GRC
issue should raise serious concern for security
and IT professionals in all companies, even
those with small employee databases. Best
practices in the area of data protection must be
considered, both for employee data and for
client data (which is really the problem in many
cases, including HP’s). 

Encrypted and password protected files? Have some form of IT security
guard escort this data throughout the organization and its partners? And how
do you make these efforts universal throughout the organization on a highly
granular or granular enough level or align it with corporate security policies?
In large part, this is a challenge with a lot of ideas and possibilities, but without
a defining technology or method. According to the Gartner report mentioned
earlier, and others in the field, there is no definitive IT GRC product — yet. It is
an emerging market and as time goes on, products will emerge or a core of
applications used for existing needs will be leveraged into an end-to-end IT
GRC solution.
However, as you begin to consider how your company handles IT GRC, there
is one overarching thought that could help you create a context within which
to target your efforts — leveraging the network.
Leveraging the network
A company’s network is the one place that all of its data and applications come
into contact with each other and the conduit through which information trav-
els throughout the enterprise and beyond. Therefore, thinking in terms of a
277
Chapter 14: IT GRC
The buddy system: Keeping track of partners
Control of information often extends beyond the
company’s walls: Suppliers and partners often
receive sensitive information, so it is important
to consider what measures are being taken to
ensure these people act responsibly too. As a
starting point, it would be wise to consider:
 Setting and documenting policies defining
who the partners are and which partners
should have access to what and what can
be shared with a partner.
 Ensuring that partners’ internal policies
should match your goals with regard to IT
GRC and protecting information. This can be
accomplished via a service level agreement
stating what each side must live up to.
 Collaborating carefully. There is also the
issue of federated websites and the means
by which partners gain access behind the
curtain. Protocols should be established
that are protective and create an auditable
trail, but allow for an efficient workflow.
 Integrating the GRC framework with under-
lying network technology to prevent data
leakage.
 Enforcing data transfer policies.
 Encrypting communications and other forms
of IP data transfer.
The partner’s IT environment should have the
capacity to be able to support your company’s
IT GRC goals. Especially for key partners, a site
visit is in order to evaluate how well what the
partner says matches what it does (for example,
how easy is it to gain physical access to
servers?).

single platform approach rather than trying to react to each technology threat
and/or risk scenario is a very important message.
If you think of the possible risks in terms of IT assets — such as laptop com-
puters, cell phones, BlackBerries, and the like — and sending data from one
point to another electronically, these risks have an important factor in
common. The common point of data departure is from the network — a
hacker breaks into the network to gain access, a device is connected to the
network to access and download data, or information is sent via the network.
Therefore, rather than attempt to come up with a multitude of countermea-
sures, protections can be placed at the network level.
To begin, most companies carry volumes of data with a range from high to low
sensitivity. Therefore, considering the amount of data, it’s helpful to establish
policies and procedures to delineate the level of importance for certain types
of information. For example, customer credit card or social security numbers
should hold a much higher priority than other types of information. High
value information should receive an elevated degree of protection such as
being encrypted, strict password protection, and other controls.
Other ways data can walk away
Go into a store and at the checkout line among the flashlights and gum, you’ll
see a jump drive. This tiny device connects via a USB port and allows data to
be moved between computers. It also allows product specifications, intellec-
tual property, and customer information to leave the building without pass-
ing through the network (necessarily). This particular type of threat indicates
that certain data must receive special protection, or classification. Such data
should not be allowed to walk out of the building via a jump drive or another
device, such as an iPod. Data protection is another important issue.
Ultimately, employees must be trained to handle data properly depending on
their role and privileges. You must determine who handles sensitive data and
ensure that they are aware of the policies surrounding it, have a legitimate
reason for being given access to it, and do not have conflicting roles (see
Chapter 6) that could compromise their ability to be objective with regard 
to handling the data. For this latter issue, access control could provide an
appropriate resource. As an example, access control could be used to ensure
that an IT administrator with access to credit card numbers is unable to cor-
relate those numbers with customer names and other information.
In all, the intent is to add an extra layer of protection and risk prevention in
order to prevent problems or quickly resolve them if they occur.
278
Part IV: Managing the Flow of Information 

Protecting IT assets
As the means to carry information have evolved to include devices such as
cell phones, BlackBerries, laptops, jump drives, and so on, controlling whether
someone can walk away with sensitive information is something of a whole
new world. It’s not enough to simply restrict access to the building, but to
consider that even a properly credentialed employee could load work-related
information onto a jump drive or laptop and have it stolen or misplace it. 
In a perfect world, every access point in the network would recognize when a
foreign device has been connected to it. This may be accomplished when a
device is connected directly to the network, for example the system would
recognize a jump drive has been connected and would issue a report and/or
require a password in order for data to be downloaded. 
Also, because certain types of information have been given a high value, there
could be a lock preventing, say, CAD designs (intellectual property) or Social
Security numbers from being downloaded to any mobile device. This lock
could also prevent data from coming into a database storing this information
so that the information’s integrity would not be compromised.
However, frequently, authorized employees download information onto a
laptop. You may want them to be able to do that, but you would also want to
prevent a jump drive or other device from being able to attach to the laptop.
Further, with RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tags, it would be possible
to monitor whether laptops leave their assigned workstations and even if
someone walks out the front door with them. It could also be possible to place
a chip on the laptop that wipes it clean should it move from a certain area.
As cell phones have gone from a means to communicate to data carrying and
management tools (smart phones), they also represent a risk. Therefore,
countermeasures such as requiring passwords for phones every 10 to 20 min-
utes could prevent a misplaced or stolen phone from being used for access to
all kinds of data. The same holds true for BlackBerries and any other mobile
devices employees use to do their jobs.
In general, it is important to seek out solutions that enforce guidelines no
matter what technology is in use. For example, if a foreign device is trying 
to download information, it should be noticed and prevented from doing so.
Uploading information should also be monitored, so that when the next pro-
tocol arrives (like BitTorrent) or the next Web 2.0 innovation arrives (such as
wikis), data leaving the network this way is monitored as well.
Although technology can help with some of these issues, strong IT governance
must align with these goals. For example, there should be policies surround-
ing the use of passwords, restrictions on USB usage, restricting where assets
279
Chapter 14: IT GRC

can be moved to, policies on how IT assets can be handled, access to server
rooms, elimination of SoD issues, policies about how certain types of infor-
mation can be handled, policies requiring employees to use company cell
phones or other mobile devices, and so on. 
And enforcement of these policies should be done at the network layer when
possible.
Communication
Information doesn’t have to travel outside of the company on a mobile device.
E-mail, file transfer, conference calls, and other means to communicate also
present a challenge.
And when considering the volume of these communications, preventing all of
the imaginable risk scenarios can seem like a rather daunting prospect.
The first step is to take a rather surgical approach to it. For example, data with
a high level of sensitivity should receive a higher level of protection when it
travels across or outside of the network. In the case of an email, packet scan-
ning would identify if an email has a high value attachment and the network
could block it from traveling to an outside IP address or from being sent at all.
Emails and other correspondence could be scanned for certain code words
such as those relating to an impending merger or large scale business initiative.
Pattern recognition technology is another control that could be applied.
Essentially, these are IT solutions that look at usage patterns and can deter-
mine when usage exceeds or contrasts in some way with a defined pattern,
such as “Why are we sending more encrypted emails to one address or set of
addresses than is normal?” or “Why is someone browsing around our data-
bases that carry customer information?” Once identified, the user can be
logged out and/or an e-mail sent to an appropriate person to determine what
is going on and if necessary initiate a response.
When considering communications such as conference calls and video con-
ferencing, all of which enable a higher level of collaboration, it is important to
ensure these interactions are secure, but also that they happen efficiently so
they can facilitate collaboration. Manual controls such as policies establishing
how these conversations are to occur — use of secure call conferencing and
passwords — could be employed. There is also the idea of application-to-
application security, which could prevent connections to nonapproved 
conferencing technology. 
In short, policies and the network should be in the position of being able to
identify what is coming in and going out and to assure that when sensitive

n this chapter, we look at the relationship between corporate performance
management (CPM) and GRC. The goal of our analysis is to show how cre-
ating processes for collecting and analyzing the data that is used for GRC
overlaps to a significant extent with CPM. If you think about both GRC and
CPM at the same time when you are designing ways to gather and make sense
of information, you can cut costs and create a flow of high-quality data that
helps run the business better (which is the goal of CPM), while at the same
time achieving the goals of GRC.
If you’ve slogged through this book’s coverage about the many different ways
of complying, managing risk, and governing your company, it should be clear
that making GRC processes work effectively is quite a bit of work. The same
thing is true of improving CPM processes to get better information. Although
some of this work is mandatory and other tasks just make good sense, one
thing is clear — most companies’ investment in GRC is a major one, so com-
panies must maximize the benefit by making every step meet as many needs
as possible.
The fundamental idea is that GRC or CPM shouldn’t be addressed in a narrow
way. When you approach either topic, you are looking at a business process
and how it needs to be monitored and controlled. What kind of information
must be provided to evaluate operation efficiency, levels of risk, and compli-
ance with regulations? A full set of requirements involves tracking the aspects
of the process that may be useful for both CPM and GRC. This chapter exam-
ines the things these two processes have in common and recommends some
ways of thinking about both topics at the same time.

Turning On the Lights with CPM
As companies have grown larger and more complex, the demand for action-
able information has grown dramatically. Boards of directors, CEOs, CFOs,
and executives at all levels want an accurate view of the performance of the
business. Outsourcing has also driven the need for more detailed informa-
tion. A company that hires another company to perform a task seeks to keep
track of how the work is going, which is especially important because under
most regulatory schemes, the company using the outsourcer is liable for
what the outsourcer does. The world moves fast, and serious operational
risks can appear in a blink.
As with most common needs of business, this desire for information has been
recognized, studied, and analyzed. The name given for the large number of
activities that take place to provide better information to managers is called
corporate performance management, or CPM. To understand how CPM and
GRC are two sides of the same coin, you first must look at the different parts
of CPM.
CPM has evolved from financial budgeting and consolidation to a complete
360-degree view of performance management for an organization. This
panoramic view adds in strategy management and profitability management
to optimize the basics of financial budgeting and consolidation. Although
CPM has been covered in many books, white papers, seminars, and confer-
ences, it can be accurately simplified into the following dimensions:
 Strategy management: This part of CPM concerns itself with translating
corporate goals into initiatives and key performance indicators, which
provide guidance that align actions across the organization. Strategy
management also encompasses monitoring the performance of the cor-
poration to see if the strategy that has been set forth is being achieved.
The mechanisms of strategy management are initiatives, KPIs (key 
performance indicators), and high-level analysis techniques like the 
balanced scorecard that organizes important indicators of a company’s
performance. One important idea behind strategy management is that
the company must understand its behavior not only in financial terms
but also in terms of the other sorts of public and private value that is
created. The challenge of strategy management is to ensure that all
employees understand the impact that their actions have on the perfor-
mance of the organization. Therefore, key performance indicators must
be chosen carefully and calculated from accurate data.
 Planning: With a strategy clearly in place, planning can begin. But you
shouldn’t think of planning only in terms of budgets. Planning is about
strategic resource allocation. What resources does each part of the busi-
ness need to do its job? How are resources going to be allocated accord-
ing to the strategy? How will the company know if the resources are being
282
Part IV: Managing the Flow of Information 

used properly? What are measures of success for each department? What
performance is expected according to those measures? What are the
potential risks to the plan?
 Reporting and consolidation: In this phase of CPM, you take financial
results and consolidate them for various purposes. For example, the
results are consolidated both for financial reporting (to the SEC), known
as statutory consolidation, and for management reporting (in such a
case, consolidation by business unit or product line makes more sense).
 Revenue, cost, and profitability modeling: Understanding the profitabil-
ity of your business activities provides perspective and guidance for your
strategic planning cycle. As you create a strategy — a plan — and exe-
cute it, it is vital to understand the profits and losses associated with cus-
tomers, channels, products, and other business activities. To do this, you
must be able to predict and track revenue and costs. Accurate models for
these numbers enable you to forecast profits, which becomes an impor-
tant factor in understanding the success of a corporate strategy and
helps you compare alternatives when allocating resources.
If we take a step back, it is easy to see a parallel between the general shape
and patterns of activity in CPM and GRC. Both disciplines have a strong top-
down component. Strategy in CPM sets the broad picture. Governance in GRC
does the same thing. Strategy is of course related to governance. Strategy is
the what: governance is the how.
In fact, the components of CPM and GRC are, in most cases, two halves of the
same coin. Strategy management lays out the goals of the organization as
well as initiatives for turning those goals into action. Governance provides
the rules, policies, and applicable regulations that must govern those actions.
Business planning is more effective when it is informed about material risks
to the business, and resources for mitigating those risks are allocated appro-
priately — and risks must be analyzed in the context of business plans in
order to establish relevance and material impact. Financial results need to be
consolidated in a way that ensures compliance in order to be reportable. In
each case, parallel business processes are utilizing the same data for separate
but related purposes.
The planning stage moves to a more detailed level. In CPM, resources are
allocated and KPIs are created. In GRC, some of those same KPIs may be used
to identify and manage risks or to help identify improper behavior. Some KPIs
may be called Key Risk Indicators (KRIs), but they are usually numbers that
can be used for many purposes if they are meaningful.
In the reporting and consolidation stage, the convergence becomes stronger.
Neither CPM nor GRC can be effective without accurate data. Financial
reporting, referred to as statutory reporting, must obviously be compliant
283
Chapter 15: Turning On the Lights with GRC and CPM

with generally accepted accounting principles and other applicable regula-
tions. The certifiability of the numbers being reported depends in large 
measure on GRC activities such as segregation of duties. If this groundwork
has been laid, executives can have confidence in their statutory reporting.
Although CPM is concerned with the meaning of the numbers, GRC is con-
cerned with the traceability and auditability of the processes used to create
those numbers.
With respect to modeling, both CPM and GRC create many models of correct
or desired activity and then detect and measure variances from the model.
The core components of CPM and GRC are correlated. They are so similar
and have so many overlapping aspects that it seems obvious that they
should be addressed in a synchronized and integrated manner. But in prac-
tice, this is rarely the case for a variety of reasons. In the next section, we
explore the case for an integrated approach to CPM and GRC and the barriers
in the way.
Making the Case for CPM 
and GRC Integration
The case for an integrated approach to CPM and GRC amounts to the follow-
ing argument:
 Both CPM and GRC are involved with monitoring business activity.
 Both CPM and GRC are part of virtually every business process in the
enterprise.
 When designing a business process, the needs of both CPM and GRC
should be incorporated so that monitoring, compliance, and risk man-
agement are part of the normal way of doing business.
 Addressing CPM and GRC in an integrated fashion will result in cost sav-
ings, better information, and improvements in the quality of both CPM
and GRC processes.
Companies set their overall business strategy and have a need to tie in key
risks associated with the overall strategy. For example, say that a company’s
key strategy is to enter the Chinese market. The KPI for this objective is to
grow market share in China by 10 percent of the company’s overall revenue
by only investing $5 million on the overall plan. Before the company executes
on this key objective of entering the Chinese market, management needs to
know what risks are involved, such as infrastructure, resources, market con-
ditions, and regulations. In addition, besides evaluating the risks of entering
the Chinese market, how will the company track against the $5 million plan
284
Part IV: Managing the Flow of Information 

and ensure profitability against its budget? In this example, you can see the
need to tie in CPM (for planning, profitability, and actuals against budgets)
with GRC (for measuring risk and monitoring regulations).
Although this argument is theoretically compelling to most people, in practice,
CPM and GRC are frequently not integrated.
Understanding obstacles to integration
The convergence of CPM and GRC faces a variety of obstacles. First of all,
both CPM and GRC are in their early stage of definition and acceptance. Just
a short time ago, CPM and GRC were only addressed by point solutions that
handled a single area, such as managing Sarbanes-Oxley compliance. Now,
point solutions compete with integrated suites that address the whole prob-
lem. The notion of an integrated suite of solutions that addresses both CPM
and GRC is only just starting to appear on the horizon. Many analysts predict
that this convergence will happen quickly and CPM and GRC will soon be
thought of together, but this idea is still in its infancy.
Another obstacle is that the integrated approach may run into organizational
and political barriers. If a department is in charge of GRC, it may not want to
become part of the CPM department, or vice versa. If someone is in control of
a niche function, she may not want to see it integrated into another depart-
ment. This sort of barrier is common to many efforts at improving business
processes.
The tendency to think of GRC, and to a lesser extent CPM, as pass/fail activi-
ties also reduces the appetite for pursuing an integrated approach. The “tone
at the top,” meaning the attitude management expresses about the impor-
tance of an activity, is an important element of a successful program. When
the goal is to focus only on compliance at the lowest possible cost, opportu-
nities for integration are hard to pursue.
Competition for resources can also slow any progress toward pursuing an
integrated approach. CPM and GRC are often seen only to produce enterprise-
wide benefits, which means that it may sometimes be hard to find advocates
for improving these processes. Although high-quality information is of benefit
to every level of a company, unless a specific champion for it emerges at
some level, an integrated approach will not be pursued.
Past efforts at creating dashboards for executives can also be a barrier. Some
of these efforts failed to live up to expectations and left senior executives
with a lasting sense of disappointment. Even though service-oriented archi-
tecture (with its ability to refresh data frequently across the network) and
improved enterprise software makes information more accessible, some
executives are reluctant to pursue such projects because of past failures.
285
Chapter 15: Turning On the Lights with GRC and CPM

The negative effect of excessive scrutiny is another objection to increased
monitoring of the sort that comes with an integrated approach to CPM and
GRC. Some companies argue that they don’t want to make employees feel
that Big Brother is watching them as they pursue their activities. Although 
it may be true that expressing distrust of employees can be damaging to
morale, collecting more information doesn’t have to be negative. Expressing
clear KPIs and KRIs along with targets for performance can provide employ-
ees with a sense of relief because they have clear guidance about what is
expected of them.
Instrumenting the enterprise
Perhaps the best way to understand the convergence of CPM and GRC is 
to step back and take an abstract view. The goal of both CPM and GRC is to
monitor other activities and then provide information to help improve their
effectiveness, efficiency, and form. Both CPM and GRC collect data that sum-
marizes the activity of the business processes of the enterprise. To a large
extent, CPM is looking to quantify certain activities (How much revenue? How
much expense? How efficient was a process?). GRC is frequently looking to
see that certain activities took place (Was a credit check obtained and was
the process followed?) as well as quantities (Is too much purchasing flowing
through a single supplier, creating a risk?).
In both cases, after the information is gathered and analyzed, a process of
informing someone may be initiated that reports on the failure or success 
of the business process in meeting its goals. In this way, the information 
collected by both CPM and GRC leads to the creation and execution of new
processes for reporting and problem resolution.
The goal of most efforts at improving CPM and GRC is also the same; that is,
to take point activities and merge them into an integrated whole. The infor-
mation both CPM and GRC provide is much more valuable when it is timely.
But in many cases, information for both CPM and GRC is collected through
manual processes that create data that is stale, weeks or months behind the
actual performance of the enterprise. Using such data is like attempting to
drive a car by looking in the rearview mirror.
To avoid delays in creating high-quality information, the process of collecting
the data must be built into the business processes. This is the goal of most
improvement programs for CPM and GRC. But the highest level of efficiency
is obtained when the needs of both CPM and GRC are taken into account
when designing a fully instrumented business process. When this happens,
information about both CPM and GRC is available as soon as possible, which
allows quick reaction time to solve problems or manage risks. Efficiencies
from this integrated approach result from the fact that common data, activi-
ties, and people are leveraged across both CPM and GRC.
286
Part IV: Managing the Flow of Information 

Often improvements in GRC are promoted based on the goal of “keeping the
CFO out of jail.” But this narrow perspective obscures the larger benefit of
improved instrumentation of a business. In the fast changing modern market-
place where risks can appear in a flash, running your business based on num-
bers that are stale and old is worse than going to jail (okay, some may argue
this point). For this reason, some CFOs have stopped attributing investments
in better instrumentation to compliance. Getting better data about the busi-
ness in a timely fashion helps both compliance and running the business.
How can you tell the difference between data for compliance and data for
performance? Some CFOs say you can’t tell the difference and have stopped
trying to make this distinction.
So, from a high level, the value and efficiencies of integrated CPM and GRC
are clear. But business happens at the level of detail. How will an integrated
approach improve my day-to-day operations? Read on to find out.
Collecting the payoff from CPM 
and GRC integration
A variety of benefits flow from an integrated approach. Perhaps the most pro-
found is a sense of security. When CPM and GRC are integrated, you are look-
ing at reports and dashboards that reflect the current state of the business.
Answers to the following questions are readily available: How are we perform-
ing? Are we in compliance? Are our risks growing? Without integration of CPM
and GRC, the answers to such questions are only available in hindsight. How
are we doing? We won’t know for a month.
Providing immediate access to performance and compliance data also
improves the payoff in groups dedicated to performance. These groups stop
acting as human integrators who manually assemble needed information.
They cease to be in reactive mode, jumping to address problems, and are
more often seeking out new kinds of problems. Risk can be sought out sys-
tematically, not discovered after the fact.
The clock speed of a business can also move faster. If you know that you have
an accurate view of the performance of your business and your risks are
being monitored, you can devolve responsibility to the edges of the business
and let everything run faster in a more distributed manner.
Some analysts see the integration and automation of CPM and GRC as the only
remedy to the faster pace of change and higher risk profile of the modern
business environment. These analysts suggest we have reached an inflection
point for most large businesses. The complexity of the modern enterprise has
outstripped the informal performance and compliance approaches of the pre-
vious generation. One simple formulation of this viewpoint comes in the rec-
ommendation to integrate, take an enterprise perspective, and then automate
287
Chapter 15: Turning On the Lights with GRC and CPM

CPM and GRC processes. The enterprise must be fully instrumented not as a
luxury but as the only way to steer the car. To revisit our driving analogy,
instead of looking in the rear view mirror, integrated CPM and GRC turns the
lights on and allows you to see obstacles and risks sooner and to drive faster.
In the next couple of sections, we look at two examples that help illustrate
the practical benefits of integrated CPM and GRC.
Supplier concentration
Imagine that you work in a manufacturing firm and that your ability to produce
certain products depends on delivery of components from suppliers. As part
of your GRC program, you institute a search for concentration in specific 
suppliers of key components so you can identify potential vulnerabilities.
In the typical nonintegrated approach to GRC, you might have analysts exam-
ine the bill of materials for products being manufactured, enter the key 
components into a spreadsheet, sort them by supplier, and then identify the
suppliers that pose the most risk. Then a program could be initiated to find
alternative suppliers. For that moment in time, you understand your supplier
concentration and have mitigated the risk.
An integrated approach would recognize that the concentration of risk in
suppliers will change over time. Identifying and managing concentration
would be made part of routine operations. Here’s how this might work:
 The bill of materials for each product would be extracted on a monthly
basis into an automated report that would sort the components by sup-
plier to reveal any concentration. Concentrations above a certain level
would trigger an event that would notify the appropriate executives.
 The report and any events would be reviewed during a monthly GRC
meeting to determine how they should be remediated.
 The task of finding a new supplier, redesigning products to reduce con-
centration, or improving the service-level agreement with the supplier
would be assigned to the appropriate executives.
 Product design staff would be part of the team managing concentration
so that new product design could be performed in such a way to avoid
excessive concentration in one supplier.
In this way, the management of a specific risk, supplier concentration, has
become part of an improved process that provides the company with more
information about supplier concentration to meet CPM objectives and has
baked risk remediation processes into standard operating procedure.
288
Part IV: Managing the Flow of Information 

Loan processing
Loan processing offers another example of the convergence of CPM and GRC.
The process of making loans in most financial institutions is highly distrib-
uted. Hundreds or thousands of people are involved in evaluating the risk in
each loan application and determining whether the loan meets the accept-
able parameters. The acceptable parameters change constantly as interest
rates and market conditions change.
Much of the processing of loans can be automated to improve the performance
of a company. In automating loan processing and approval, the loan must be
evaluated to determine if it meets certain parameters. One compliance issue
related to such automation called “configuration persistence.” It can be pos-
sible for someone to change the parameters in a system and then run a loan
through that is improper, fraudulent, or perhaps a legitimate exception. The
process of automation, which was introduced to increase performance, could
be supplemented by a compliance event that is raised each time the configu-
ration parameters are changed. If the change is not approved by an appropri-
ate person within a certain amount of time, it would be escalated to more
senior executives. In this way, automation to improve performance is
extended to address compliance.
Seeing CPM and GRC Integration 
in Practice
In the next few sections, we look at a few more detailed examples that illustrate
the opportunity of CPM and GRC integration.
The intersection of actuals
CPM and GRC take a different view of actuals, the numbers that reflect the
financial and operational performance of a business. To CPM, the quantity 
of these numbers is the important thing. (How much revenue? How much
expense? How much income?). To GRC, the traceability and auditability of
the numbers are primary. The best quality information is both accurate and
auditable.
But as anyone who has worked in accounting knows, no automated system
always gets everything right. Accountants and bookkeepers are always
making journal entries to correct the information collected about the busi-
ness. But as recent scandals have shown, journal entries may also be abused
to fraudulently influence financial reports.
289
Chapter 15: Turning On the Lights with GRC and CPM

So the best integration of CPM and GRC would be one that addresses the
intersection. Processes must be in place to allow journal entries to be made
to increase the accuracy of the numbers, but these journal entries must be
scrutinized and audited as an enforced policy to make sure that no fraud is
taking place. A good GRC system will also enforce segregation of duties to
mitigate the risk of fraud. The faster the journal entries can be made, while
still ensuring good governance, the better information a company will have —
with minimal external audit expenses.
Strategy, risk, and planning
Almost all strategic plans include an expected scenario along with pessimistic
and optimistic variants. Why? Because every strategy faces risks and obsta-
cles that may slow it down, resulting in the pessimistic scenario. Or perhaps
things will go better than expected, resulting in the optimistic scenario.
An integrated approach to CPM and GRC puts KPIs and key risk indicators
(KRIs) in place to measure the risks and in effect determine which scenario 
is accurate. From a CPM perspective, the measures help determine what the
performance is and how close or far the company is from its expected sce-
nario. From a GRC perspective, the measures indicate magnitude of risks that
a company is facing. From both perspectives, having a clear picture allows
the right remediation to be taken in a timely manner.
For example, if a company decides to change its strategy from acquiring new
customers to increasing the share of wallet from existing customers, the 
KPIs that define success also change. Revenue per customer becomes more
important than new customers added each quarter. The risks change as well.
An integrated program of CPM and GRC allows the focus to shift not just at a
high level, but at the level of instrumentation that gives specific guidance to
those carrying out the change in strategy.
Governance and strategy
Strategy reflects what the business is intending to do; that is, what decisions
or choices the business is going to make to achieve whatever it has decided
to achieve. In this way, strategy reflects the what of an organization’s goals.
CPM has historically focused on measuring how well the what is being
achieved. Governance really reflects the how — the codes of conduct and the
policies and frameworks that reflect how the strategy should be realized.
The case for integration of CPM and GRC is based on the convergence of the
what and the how. The mechanisms to keep track of each overlap in many
ways that must be balanced. The focus on what over how leads to the kinds
of errors that have been reported in recent scandals, where the pressure to
290
Part IV: Managing the Flow of Information 

produce results overcame governance mechanisms. Overemphasis of how
over what can lead to an organization focused on compliance at the expense
of performance. At its worst, this means a company has perfectly clean
audits but goes out of business.
Discovering the Reusable 
Technology of GRC
One of the benefits of taking a serious approach to GRC is that new capabilities
are brought into an organization. GRC processes and supporting software exist
to monitor activities of a business. What is less well understood is that the soft-
ware platform that supports GRC is actually a framework that can be used for
many other purposes besides GRC, including CPM, business intelligence,
process optimization, and automating processes for problem resolution.
Right now, GRC software is a bit further along in its maturity, so this section
briefly describes the aspects of the software platform that supports GRC. In
the past, this same layer of software has sometimes been referred to as the
GRC foundation. Whatever it is called, a GRC platform usually provides the
following capabilities that have multiple uses.
Repository
A GRC platform must have a repository that stores unstructured items such
as documents and also structured information that describes controls,
processes, events, and so on. The repository must have some sort of reten-
tion management so that auditors can see how information changed over
time and who changed it. All sorts of information can be stored in the reposi-
tory, including predefined parameters and process descriptions that tailor
the GRC application to a particular industry or purpose.
Document management
Documents that describe strategy, policies, controls, and reports delivered to
regulators all must be kept in a central location with versions and a historical
archive. A GRC platform must have a document management solution to per-
form this function. Frequently, this solution is implemented through a stan-
dard that allows any document management system that meets the standard
to be used for the repository. An integrated approach to GRC and CPM lever-
ages the documentation in a shared repository from strategy creation all the
way down to spend compliance of the budget against the strategy.
291
Chapter 15: Turning On the Lights with GRC and CPM

Case management
When a task or issue arises, people are assigned to address it. Case manage-
ment functionality in a GRC platform provides an environment for tracking
the work done on a case and supporting other forms of collaboration. A case
ties GRC and CPM together when, for example, someone in finance makes
several journal entry reversals that could impact the actuals for the quarter.
Such an occurrence would automatically send the CFO or VP of Finance a
case alerting them about the compliance risk and providing them with overall
reporting visibility.
Workflow
GRC platforms frequently support defined workflows for approvals, case
management, and other tasks that require participate of many people in a
series of well-defined steps. With the addition of CPM in the process, the
workflow can also be tied to all the steps in the month-end closing process
along with any GRC-related substeps.
Process modeling
GRC platforms frequently support forms of business modeling that can be
used to describe the processes in a company. These models are then used to
analyze the efficiency of processes and to determine where and how to imple-
ment controls. In CPM, the business templates can tie into GRC to expedite
key processes such as month-end close. In addition, CPM has a predictive
engine that shows the root cause and effect of issues that can also be tied
into GRC business modeling.
Policy engine
A policy engine is part of a GRC platform that allows declarative expression 
of policies that are implemented in the systems to enforce certain activities
using mechanisms of the GRC platform and of enterprise applications. CPM
also has processes and documentation, such as how to close the books at
year end that are tied to GRC policy engine.
292
Part IV: Managing the Flow of Information 

Rule engine
A rule engine is a way of expressing rules that govern the behavior of the GRC
platform. Rules can be used to determine how to handle events, what to do if
a control is violated, how to distribute reports, and so on. Expressing auto-
mation as rules allows a large number of people to participate in determining
the behavior of the GRC platform. In CPM, rules are set for activities, such as
cost allocation per headcount for each facility that resides in the rules engine.
When the value for a rule is above the threshold, a case is created and
assigned to the relevant user. The user is then referred back to the documen-
tation or policy engine for information on how to fix the broken process.
Controls
A GRC platform provides an environment for expressing the design of a
system of controls and implementing and tracking the information gathered
from them. Preventative or detective controls can be implemented in the GRC
platform or at the direction of the GRC platform in enterprise applications,
the network, or through other means. Any portion of CPM, whether it’s bud-
geting, booking of actuals, the consolidation process, setting of the overall
strategy, or monitoring and measuring profitability can be tied to a control
within GRC. For example, if a product profit margin is below 10 percent, a
control can be put in place in GRC, allowing the user to be alerted if the profit
margin becomes too thin.
Reporting
GRC platforms usually are able to produce reports as part of their basic func-
tionality as well as exporting data to data marts or data warehouses for more
advanced analysis. The marriage of CPM with GRC reporting enables the pro-
duction of optimal analytics for performance as well as the ability to measure
the effectiveness of governance and compliance in the organization.
Standardized interfaces to components
A GRC platform usually implements many of its components, such as data-
bases, data warehouses, and document repositories using standardized inter-
faces that allow the implementation to be provisioned by any product that
implements the standard. CPM also ties into these key interfaces and enables
companies to leverage their underlying systems to extract master data and
leverage it for these components.
293
Chapter 15: Turning On the Lights with GRC and CPM

Composite apps on the platform
All of these components of GRC and CPM can be combined to create new
applications to automate processes or provide environments for special
kinds of analysis. Such composite applications can be used for GRC, CPM, 
or any purpose that is required, such as optimization or management of 
specific processes or line of business.

re you eager to get started with GRC? This chapter details the strategies
used in the most successful GRC projects.
Evaluate Which of the Most Prevalent
GRC Issues Apply to You
The most prevalent GRC issues facing companies include audit compliance,
segregation of duties, and internal productivity and resource availability.
For audit compliance, you should
 Establish an approach and process to manage risks.
 Pinpoint sources of deficiencies and data sources to identify 
preventative measures.
 Eliminate conflicting testing methods and reconciliations.
For segregation of duties, you’ll want to
 Identify business functions that produce risks when executed 
by one person.
 Gain risk visibility on 100 percent of user population.
 Perform risk analysis before committing and approving changes 
to access controls.

To improve internal productivity and resource availability
 Focus on prevention. It’s better to prevent bad things from happening in
the first place than to simply detect them after the fact.
 Document test results and violations by business process and organiza-
tion. Doing so will give you a scorecard of what’s happening in various
business processes and units.
 Select controls and tolerances concurrent with organization policies,
procedures, and regulations. In other words, you don’t want alarms
going off all the time — just when something warrants further 
investigation.
Adopt Best Practices
The 2006 SAP GRC Benchmarking Survey identified seven best practices 
for GRC:
 Document well and store the documentation centrally. All processes
should be well-documented and stored in a central repository, including
the documentation of policies, work papers, and evidence to meet
requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley sections 302 and 404.
 Automate as many controls as possible. The majority of process control
testing is automated and can be scheduled for appropriate locations,
business units, or legal entities.
 Automate the flow of manual controls to keep them moving. Manual 
control testing is streamlined with automated task assignments, guided
procedures, and workflows. 
 Find segregation of duties (SoD) violations automatically. SoD risk identi-
fication and remediation should be performed automatically, across 
multiple ERP environments and instances.
 Automate user provisioning and changes. User access administration 
and change management should be automated with approval notification
and mandatory compliance verification.
 Make business people responsible. Business process managers should
be accountable for control documentation and testing, not Internal 
Audit or IT.
 Audit yourself. Internal Audit should regularly perform audits to cover
the effectiveness and efficiency of operations, the reliability of financial
reporting, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and safe-
guarding of assets.

Implement Key GRC Strategies
You can reduce risks, time, and cost by putting these plays into your GRC
playbook:
 Promote effective business personnel participation.
 Reduce effort by automating.
 Segregate business and technical issues.
 Attack the sources of problems to promote prevention.
 Leverage processes to integrate best practices into the organization.
Set Yourself Up for Success
Here are some success factors that can help you ensure the success of your
GRC implementation project: 
 Identify the right people to help:
• Active executive participation
• A good project manager
• Decision makers
• People who can encourage collaboration among all parties
• People who have deep knowledge of the business processes 
 Employee and company knowledge are essential.
 Don’t wait for the perfect time or future functionality.
 Focus on priorities and methodologies.
 Focus on high-risk areas, not all risks.
Watch Out for Danger Signs
Just like you work to ensure success, you have to watch out to look for signs
of the following problems as well:
 A big bang approach. Don’t be overly ambitious. Do not implement all
the products at one time.
 Unrealistic expectations. Make sure that management doesn’t believe
compliance can be achieved in a few weeks or when the project ends.
299
Chapter 16: Top Ten GRC Strategies

 The project staff is made up of contractors only. Make sure key 
internal staff works on the project as well. Having only contractors
assigned to the project means that little knowledge transfer will take
place. Furthermore, contractors don’t have a relationship with the 
business and won’t know the unique circumstances and challenges 
your company faces. 
 No authority. Project leaders are given little decision-making authority
and are simply told to just keep doing things the way we’ve always done
them. Successful GRC implementations require lots of input as well as
latitude to make important changes.
Define GRC Roles and Responsibilities
A successful GRC implementation requires broad participation. So the first
question you may hear is “What do I have to do?” Table 16-1 contains some
answers, depending on who asks the question.

Move to Strategic Adoption 
of Automated Controls
Manual controls can only check a sample of transactions, and the controls
have to be tested every day. Automatic controls check every transaction, and
after initial testing, can simply run, allowing you to manage by exception. Not
all controls can be automated controls, but the more automated controls you
put in place, the easier your job becomes.
Adopt Strategies for Cleaning 
Up Access Control
Segregation of duties violations are largely prevented through effective
access control. Because these problems have evolved over time, you’ll need
to get everyone on board in cleaning up this area.
Be sure to separate technical and business issues:
 Roles and profiles belong to IT.
 User assignments and circumstances belong to business.
 Collaboration of both required to validate results.
302
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Segregate role cleanup from user cleanup:
 Roles must not contain conflicts.
 Business managers can then take unneeded access away from particular
roles or specify an alternative if the access must be kept, such as addi-
tional supervision. 
Sometimes changing a business process or responsibilities is much easier
than trying to build roles around the process.
Eliminate risks and use mitigation for exceptions:
 Investigate and implement controls to eliminate the risk.
 Ensure users only have the access they need.
 When you need to make exceptions, identify alternative controls, and
decide who will monitor them.
Getting Your GRC Project Going 
and Keeping It Going
Begin your GRC efforts by having some business workshops to launch the
project. Here are some things to do at those workshops:
 Identify risks to be monitored.
 Discuss industry-specific risks. 
 Look at which areas of the business currently have role conflicts that
must be resolved (hint: IT and risk management professionals may
already know what these are and can point them out). 
 Start thinking about mitigating controls.
Like any effort, the focus on GRC can fizzle if not nurtured. Have a quarterly
business meeting to keep the GRC effort going:
 After initial implementations, quarterly meetings help reinforce 
GRC efforts.
 Provides assurance new risks are recognized as changes occur.
 Risk identification and recognition becomes routine.

Ten Best Practices in Global Trade
In This Chapter
 Making sure you can trust your partners
 Obtaining the proper licenses
 Leaving a paper trail
G
lobalization means a lot more of us are involved in global trade 
these days. Here are ten best practices to help you navigate these 
complicated waters. (And don’t forget to read Chapter 8 for much more 
information.)
Automate or Else
Global importing and exporting has grown so complex it’s absolutely crucial
to automate your import and export processes. Dozens of countries, hun-
dreds of regulations, and thousands of orders can quickly create a mountain
of paperwork. More importantly, it’s simply not feasible to hand check each
order to ensure it complies with global trade regulations. Rolling the dice can
have major consequences for companies — large fines and public disgrace.
The best solution is to put in place a software system — such as SAP GRC
Global Trade Services — that automates all of the essential import and
export tasks. 
Don’t Go to Pieces
Remember the old war between VHS and Beta? Customers who bought 
one system couldn’t use tapes from the other and vice versa. It was a big
mess. Today, some companies handle global trade the same way. Different

departments within each company often manage imports and exports using
processes and tools that are not necessarily compatible company wide.
Doing this is a recipe for disorder, inefficiency, and mistakes. The best way 
to handle importing and exporting is to create a central repository for all of
your global trade data and standardize on best practices for global trade.
Make Sure You Can Trust Your Partners
You might spend months centralizing your efforts and setting up the perfect
global trade system, but your hard work can easily be compromised by the
companies to which you outsource key importing and exporting tasks. A 
law firm might misclassify your product or a customs broker might not file
import documents properly. Choosing partners who are as committed to
excellence as you are is important. Check their background and research
their reputation before hiring them.
Avoid Importing Delays
The old cliché is especially true when it comes to importing. Delays at 
the border can have major costs. Goods may not arrive in time for the all-
important holiday shopping season. Parts arriving late can bring manufactur-
ing to a halt and the uncertainty of when goods will arrive means expensive
safety stock must be kept on hand. A clearly delineated importing plan is 
the best way to stave off these border snags. The plan should feature a good
customs broker (if needed), a system for processing documents, classifying
goods, and clearing goods through Customs.
Get On Board with the Government’s
High-Tech Documenting Processes
The government is not usually known for its tech savvy, but one area where 
it has made strides in the last decade or so is in importing and exporting 
documentation. In fact, many trade documents are required to be filed 
electronically with the U.S. government. Even though some companies have
shirked these new regulations, it’s critical to have a software system in place
to file these documents, rather than pay a third party an arm and a leg to
handle it for you.
306
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Know Who Is Allowed at the Party
We all know people who can ruin a good party, so we don’t invite them. It’s
no different in the export business. More and more countries and govern-
ment agencies maintain growing lists of “restricted parties” that can not be
shipped to. These bans are usually on terrorist-related groups and can
change daily. In addition, shipping some goods to countries that are embar-
goed or are sanctioned is illegal. Needless to say, violating these restrictions
can result in major penalties, bad press, and jail time. The best way to avoid
these pitfalls is to implement an automated system to flag shipments that
might violate embargoes, “restricted parties” lists, or other government 
regulations.
Know Who You’re Shipping to
Security can be tricky to navigate in the post-September 11 world. One of 
the trickiest aspects for exporters is making sure that their goods don’t fall
into the wrong hands. Under global trade regulations, a shipper can be held
responsible if terrorists use its goods for nefarious purposes — even if the
goods are used in a way that the company never intended. (For example,
coffee filters were used by terrorists to sift anthrax, a use coffee filter makers
never anticipated.) Companies can sidestep these potential headaches by
setting up a system to flag goods that could possibly cause problems if they
are exported.
Get the Right Licenses
It seems like there is a license for everything these days. Exports, it turns 
out, are no different. The licenses aren’t just required for obvious goods like
firearms, but for advanced technology, medical devices, and other classes 
of goods. Failing to get a proper license can result in major fines.
Take the Free Money
Companies leave millions of dollars on the table each year by not taking
advantage of international trade agreements. The North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA), the Central America-Dominican Republic-United States
307
Chapter 17: Ten Best Practices in Global Trade

Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) and others offer companies breaks on 
tariffs, if their products qualify for the program. It can be a headache to
determine if your products meet the standards, but software can make the
task much simpler. Why throw away free money? 
Leave a Paper Trail
An international shipment can create as many as 35 different documents 
as an item travels to its destination. Saving and keeping track of these 
documents may be a hassle, but it has become absolutely crucial. Because
companies can be held liable for shipping dangerous items to terrorists 
or even for terrorists misusing their items for bad purposes, it’s important 
to have a paper trail documenting the precautions you took to follow inter-
national trade regulations. In addition, accounting regulations enacted in the
wake of the Enron collapse mean companies must keep detailed financial
records of importing and exporting transactions. Audit trails are important 
to keeping your company, not to mention the regulators, happy.

system or application once she has signed on. Role-based access control
defines a person’s access to transactions according to their job function. 
accounting controls: Procedures and documentation concerned with 
safeguarding of assets, the conduct and recording of financial transactions,
and the reliability of financial records.

controls can be executed on every relevant transaction, ensuring greater
accuracy with less effort.
Basel II: An international standard for banking that regulators can use when
making regulations on how much capital banks must have to offset potential
risk. The more risk a bank has, the more capital it should have in place to
ensure that it stays solvent. The regulation was the second such standard
issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, and hence the name
Basel II.
board of directors: Publicly traded companies must have a board of direc-
tors. The members of company’s board of directors are elected by its share-
holders. The board of directors is responsible for looking out for the interests
of the shareholders as well as other stakeholders such as employees.

Most charts of accounts classify each account into one of five categories:
Assets, Liabilities, Equity, Income, or Expenses. 
CIO (Chief Information Officer): An executive who is responsible for a
