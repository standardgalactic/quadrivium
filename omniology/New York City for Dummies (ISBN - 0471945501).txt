Introduction
T
he diversity, depth, resilience, and spirit of New York have been chron-
icled so much in the news and in films and books that it’s almost a
cliché. But in New York’s case, the cliché is not only accurate, but it’s 
also one we New Yorkers take pride in. And New Yorkers usually disdain
clichés. We like things to be new, fresh — exciting. In a way, New Yorkers
have short attention spans; a restaurant, show, club, or store may be the
hottest thing to hit the city for a couple of months, and then another
opens or is discovered, and that once-hot place quickly becomes passé.
But not everything has to be new and hot for New Yorkers. We don’t
always appreciate change because it means we may have lost something
we had come to love. New Yorkers respect the old standards — places
and things that never change. Those are essential ingredients that make
up New York. What would we do without that reassuring sight of the
Lady in the harbor? Or the gleaming spire of the Empire State Building?
Or the perfect pizza? Or a Sunday in Central Park? Or the rumbling of the
trains beneath our feet? Or the sounds of jazz from a Village club? So
even though New York is ever-changing, its core remains the same. And
we wouldn’t have it any other way.
In the pages that follow, I do my best to guide you to what’s hot and new,
without leaving out the old standards. I tell you where to find the best
New York has to offer. I steer you to places both on and off the beaten
path. But really, what I hope to accomplish in this book is to present
New York as simply as possible so that you can decide what path you
want to be on during your visit.
About This Book
Maybe this is your first trip to New York, or maybe you’re a repeat visi-
tor; in either case, I assume that you want to find out what you need to
know plus a little bit more. But I don’t want to overload you with infor-
mation, which is very easy to do when you’re talking about New York.
This book is both a guidebook and a reference book. You can read it
cover to cover, or you can jump in anywhere to find the information you
want about a specific task, such as finding a hotel or working out your
budget. Whether you’re sitting in your living room trying to make a
reservation or standing on the corner of 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue
wondering where to eat, New York City For Dummies, 4th Edition, is set
up so that you can get the facts, analysis, and recommendations you
want, quickly.

Please be advised that travel information is subject to change at any
time — this is especially true of prices. I therefore suggest that you write
or call ahead to confirm prices and details when making your travel
plans. The author, editors, and publisher cannot be held responsible for
readers’ experiences while traveling. Your safety is important to us, how-
ever, so I encourage you to stay alert and be aware of your surroundings.
Keep a close eye on cameras, purses, and wallets, all favorite targets of
thieves and pickpockets.
Conventions Used in This Book
In this book, I’ve included lists of hotels, restaurants, and attractions. As
I describe each, I often include abbreviations for commonly accepted
credit cards. Take a look at the following list for an explanation of each:
AE: American Express
DC: Diners Club
DISC: Discover
MC: MasterCard
V: Visa
I’ve divided the hotels into two categories: my personal favorites and
those that don’t quite make my preferred list but still get my hearty seal
of approval. Don’t be shy about considering these “runner-up” hotels if
you’re unable to get a room at one of my favorites or if your preferences
differ from mine — the amenities offered by the runners-up and the serv-
ices that each provides make all these accommodations good choices to
consider as you determine where to rest your head at night.
I also include some general pricing information to help you as you
decide where to unpack your bags or dine on the local cuisine. I’ve used
a system of dollar signs to show a range of costs for one night in a hotel
(the price refers to a double-occupancy room) or a meal at a restaurant
(included in the cost of each meal is soup or salad, an entrée, dessert,
and a non-alcoholic drink). Check out the following table to decipher the
dollar signs:

Dummies Post-it® Flags
As you’re reading this book, you’ll find information that you’ll want to reference as you
plan or enjoy your trip –– whether it be a new hotel, a must-see attraction or a must-
try walking tour. Mark these pages with the handy Post-it® Flags included in this book
to help make your trip planning easier!

For those hotels, restaurants, and attractions that are plotted on a map,
a page reference is provided in the listing information. If a hotel, restau-
rant or attraction is outside the city limits or in an out-of-the-way area, it
may not be mapped.
Foolish Assumptions
As I wrote this book, I made some assumptions about you and what your
needs may be as a traveler. Here’s what I assumed about you:
 You’re an experienced traveler who hasn’t had much time to explore
New York and wants expert advice when you finally do get a chance
to enjoy that particular locale.
 You’re an inexperienced traveler looking for guidance when deter-
mining whether to take a trip to New York and how to plan for it.
 You’re not looking for a book that provides all the information avail-
able about New York or that lists every hotel, restaurant, or attrac-
tion available to you. Instead, you’re looking for a book that focuses
on the places that will give you the best or most unique experience
in New York.
If you fit any of these criteria, then New York City For Dummies gives you
the information you’re looking for!
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into six parts covering the major aspects of your
trip. Each part is further broken down into specific components so that
you can go right to the subtopic you want (you don’t have to read all
about nightlife if you’re just looking for a jazz club, for example).
Following are brief summaries of the parts.
Part I: Introducing New York City
In this part, I give you my opinion on the very best of New York when it
comes to hotels, attractions, events, and restaurants. This part also
includes some basic information on culture, history, architecture, and
food, along with the differences the seasons make in determining when
you may want to come to New York and a yearly calendar of events.
Introduction 3

Part II: Planning Your Trip to New York City
This part covers the nitty-gritty of trip planning: how to manage your
money and plan your budget for your New York visit; how to get to New
York; whether you should join an escorted tour or choose a package
tour; what to do if you have special needs; and other minute details.
Part III: Settling Into New York City
This part is all about getting around, from the moment your plane lands
or you step off the train or bus. I cover ground transportation into the
city, the public transit system, and sights to see on foot. This part also
includes information about the many New York neighborhoods and what
makes them distinct. From there, I explain New York lodging and how to
find the best room rate, and then I give you my favorite hotels along with
a number of very good runners-up. Finally, this part includes a chapter
on eating in New York. Here I give you an overview of the food scene in
New York, along with snacking options like pizza, bagels, dessert, and
cheap eats.
Part IV: Exploring New York City
This part describes what to see and do, from touring famous buildings
to attending a TV show taping. This part also includes a chapter on
shopping the local stores. Here, I point out the best shopping neighbor-
hoods and the city’s best stores. To help you fit in all that you want to
see without getting worn out, I also provide some sample itineraries to
help you organize your time in the city.
Part V: Living It Up after Dark: 
New York City Nightlife
This part covers New York’s major arts attractions, from Broadway
shows to clubs, and gives you an idea of what each activity costs and
how to get discount tickets. I also include a chapter on nightclubs, places
to have a drink, and other more or less civilized forms of relaxation.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
The Part of Tens gives you a few of my top tens of New York. You can
take them seriously. Or you can take them for what they are — fun.
Either way, I think you will enjoy them.
In back of this book I’ve included an appendix — your Quick Concierge —
containing lots of handy information you may need when traveling in New
York, like phone numbers and addresses for emergency personnel or area
hospitals and pharmacies, lists of local newspapers and magazines, proto-
col for sending mail or finding taxis, and more. Check out this appendix
when searching for answers to lots of questions that may come up as you
travel. You can find Quick Concierge easily because it’s printed on yellow
paper.

Icons Used in This Book
Keep your eyes peeled for icons, which appear in the margins through-
out the book. These little pictures serve as a kind of shorthand or code
to alert you to special information. Here’s the decryption key:
Keep an eye out for the Bargain Alert icon as you seek out money-saving
tips and/or great deals.
The Best of the Best icon highlights the best New York has to offer in all
categories — hotels, restaurants, attractions, activities, shopping, and
nightlife.
Watch for the Heads Up icon to identify annoying or potentially danger-
ous situations, such as tourist traps, unsafe neighborhoods, budgetary
rip-offs, and other things to beware of.
Find out useful advice on things to do and ways to schedule your time
when you see the Tip icon.
Look to the Kid Friendly icon for attractions, hotels, restaurants, and
activities that are particularly hospitable to children or people traveling
with kids.
Secret little finds or useful resources that are worth the extra bit of
effort to get to or find are highlighted by the Worth the Search icon.
Where to Go from Here
Sure, New York can seem overwhelming, but it doesn’t have to be. It can
seem budget-busting, but it doesn’t have to be. In New York, you can find
something for everyone — and that’s what makes it so special. This book,
and all it offers, should help assuage any fears or apprehensions you may
have as it guides you to a fun and stress-free trip to the Big Apple.

Part I
Introducing 
New York City

In this part . . . 
I
give you a taste of the best of New York City, with a spot-
light on the top restaurants, hotels, attractions, sights, and
sounds that make up this unique city. I do my best to guide
you to what’s hot and new, as well as to the old standards. I
tell you where to ﬁnd the best New York has to offer, and I
steer you to places both on and off the beaten track.
In this part, I also give you a brief history of New York City, as
well as overviews of the architecture and cuisine, and I ﬁnish
up with a list of books and ﬁlms you may enjoy as you get
ready to hit the town.

Chapter 1
Discovering the Best of 
New York City
In This Chapter
 Celebrating the most festive parades and seasons
 Finding rooms in the best hotels, both grand and budget
 Enjoying meals at the most delicious restaurants and street eats
 Visiting Lady Liberty and other top attractions
 Giving the credit card a workout at the top shops
 Choosing the spots with the best nightlife
W
elcome to New York City! No matter when you visit, there’s sure
to be something of interest going on. In this chapter, I list my
choices for the best events, hotels, restaurants, attractions, shopping,
culture, and nightlife.
Whether you’re looking for a world-class hotel, exotic cuisine to enjoy,
or the view from the Empire State building, I have no doubt you’ll soon
compile your own “Best of” list . . . but here’s a good place to start!
Best Events
Best Parade: West Indian-American Day Carnival and Parade. Held on
Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn, this is the biggest parade in New York. The
music (calypso, soca, reggae, and Latin), the amazing costumes, and the
incredible Caribbean food make this an unforgettable experience. If
you’re lucky enough to be in town on Labor Day, don’t miss it. See
Chapter 3.
Best Time of Year to Come to New York: Summer. Most people prefer
the temperate days of fall to visit New York, and that’s when the city is
most crowded; but my personal favorite season is summer, when the
streets are empty, restaurants and shows are easier to get into, and
countless free outdoor cultural events abound.
Best Season in New York: Christmas. Lighted Christmas trees on Park
Avenue, the big snowflake at the corner of 57th Street and Fifth Avenue,

As Little Italy has shrunk, Chinatown
has grown. The streets are mobbed daily
with seafood, fruit and vegetable, and 
DVD, CD, and sunglass vendors compet-
ing for very little sidewalk space.  
Chinatown also encompasses stores and 
restaurants that specialize in Thai, Viet-
namese, and Malaysian goods as well.   
Narrow streets are lined with skyscrapers 
here and during the week the activity is 
relentless. You’ll also find some of the 
city’s oldest and most historic structures 
here. At night and on weekends the 
area, however, is eerily desolate.

The once-famous Bohemian enclave where off-beat
became the Beats is still the city’s best people-
watching neighborhood. You won’t find any high-
rises here, just quaint, narrow streets and beautifully
preserved brownstones and townhouses.
I’m not sure why this very tiny stretch of furniture
stores, boutiques, and a few restaurants
has been designated a neighborhood, but it has.
Maybe the powers that decide these things
wanted a companion to SoHo so they came up
with NoHo (North of Houston Street).
The East Village now is home to some of the city’s
most interesting restaurants and despite its counter-
culture reputation, real estate prices are very
“establishment.”
Here’s another neighborhood that has a cute
acronym (North of Little Italy). This is really old Little
Italy in architecture, but there is nothing old about
the very hip boutiques and cafes that are sprinkled
throughout the relatively small enclave.
What once was an artist’s destination has become a
very affluent and very trendy tourist destination.
You’ll find just about all the top designer names in
retail here housed in historic cast-iron buildings.
This is where so many immigrants, especially Jewish,
settled as their first home in America. And there is
still some of that old world feel to the neighborhood
but it is fading fast as it becomes the city’s newest
hot spot for restaurants, bars, and clubs.
In the 1980s TriBeCa (Triangle Below Canal), with its
sprawling lofts and hip restaurants, became one of
the most desirable places to live. After September 11, 
2001 and its close proximity to the World Trade
Center, the area lost a bit of its luster, but that was
only temporary. TriBeCa is thriving once again.
Sadly, this once unique and charming neighborhood,
squeezed by the expansion of Chinatown, has shrunk
to a mere block or two. And what’s left, with very
few exceptions, is nothing like what it once was. You
can’t even get a good plate of pasta here anymore.

The heart of corporate Manhattan, 
Midtown East is also where you’ll find such
landmarks as Grand Central Station, the
Empire State Building, St. Patrick’s
Cathedral, the Chrysler Building, and the
United Nations.
This bustling sprawl of an area includes
many of the city’s best hotels, the Art Deco
masterpiece, Rockefeller Center, and a
neighborhood called Hell’s Kitchen where
you’ll find some of the city’s most ethnically
diverse restaurants.
In the truly American tradition, everything
here is big and gaudy and, as a result, the
streets here are constantly crammed with
people who have come to gawk at the big
and the gaudy — meaning the neon
wonderland of Times Square. 
This is a quiet, mostly residential neighbor-
hood. On its southern fringe is the Indo-
Pakistani enclave known as Curry Hill.
The heart of this neighborhood is the 
postcard-perfect little park that’s so 
exclusive you need a key to get into it. 
You don’t need a special key to live in the 
quaint and very beautiful brownstones 
that surround the park, but you do need 
money. Many of the buildings here date
back to the 1800s, giving the area a real
19th century feel. 
Cheaper rents attracted many publishing
and media businesses and, as a result, the
neighborhood is now bursting with
restaurants and clubs. Along with Union
Square, and the wildly popular greenmarket,
the Flatiron Building embodies the spirit of
this vibrant neighborhood.
With galleries everywhere, Chelsea is now 
one of the city’s arts centers. There is an
almost small town feel to this neighborhood,
which has also become the center for the 
city’s gay population.

This 843-acre nature retreat in the heart
of Manhattan is one of the great parks
of the world. Even if nature is not your 
thing, from the Central Park Zoo to the
Carousel, from playgrounds to skating
rinks, there is something for everyone in
Central Park.
This mostly residential neighborhood also
features landmarks like Lincoln Center,
the Museum of Natural History, and the
Cathedral of St. John the Divine and is
enviable because it is surrounded by two
great parks, Central Park and Riverside
Park.
Long the address of the rich and famous,
the Upper East Side is also the home to
the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the
Guggenheim, and other fantastic
museums along “Museum Mile.” You’ll
also find a thick concentration of
restaurants and bars, and, of course,
some great and very expensive shopping 
along tony Madison Avenue.

the trees at Rockefeller Center and Lincoln Center, the Hanukah meno-
rah at Grand Army Plaza at Fifth Avenue and 59th Street, the decorations
in department store windows, restaurants, and hotels. And even though
the crowds, especially around midtown and Rockefeller Center, might
bring out the Scrooge in you, the atmosphere is almost always festive
and like no other time of year. 
Best Day to Come to New York: New Year’s Day. The holidays are over.
You’ve had enough festivity — see above. You’ve wisely skipped the
insanity of New Year’s Eve and arisen fresh and sober. Get out on the
town early; you have the city practically to yourself. 
Best Hotels
For more information on all the hotels listed, refer to Chapter 9.
Best Hotel: Ritz-Carlton New York Central Park. The combination of a
great location, just across from Central Park, large well-outfitted rooms,
and typically excellent Ritz-Carlton service is as good as it gets.
Best Hotel for Modern New York Elegance: The Mercer. The best of the
hip, downtown hotels, the Mercer is located in the heart of SoHo. The
high-ceilinged, loftlike rooms and suites, some with fireplaces and all
with ceiling fans and luxurious bathrooms, are spectacular.
Best for Classic Old World Elegance: Hotel Plaza Athénée. That
European feel pervades the hotel from the old-world design to the first-
rate concierge service.
Best Trendy Hotel: The Hotel on Rivington. The first major hotel on the
increasingly trendy Lower East Side is a glass marvel with floor to ceiling
windows, views galore, soaking tubs, and THOR, one of the hottest bar/
restaurants in the city.
Best Times Square Hotel: Hotel QT. This moderately-priced recent
(2005) addition to the Times Square hotel scene was a very welcome
one. There is much to like about the Hotel QT besides its price and loca-
tion, but what I love best is the swimming pool — in the lobby — with a
swim-up bar. 
Best Moderately Priced Hotel: The Lucerne. This is my favorite hotel
on the Upper West Side and one of my favorites in New York. The homey,
neighborhood feel of the hotel combined with exceptional service and
nice-sized, well-equipped rooms make this a very attractive mid-priced
option.
Best Budget Hotel: Chelsea Lodge. If you don’t mind sharing a toilet
with other guests, this charming hotel offers impeccable comforts —
including an actual sink and shower — at a budget price.
Part I: Introducing New York City 
16

Best for Families: Hotel Beacon. Not only is this hotel a great deal —
you can get good-size suites for so much less than you would pay in
Midtown — the Upper West Side, with its parks, the Museum of Natural
History, and fun, inexpensive restaurants, is also a great neighborhood
for children.
Best Romantic Hotel: Sofitel New York. How can an almost 400-room
hotel be romantic? Maybe it’s because the hotel is French-owned and
staying here feels like you’ve escaped for a naughty tryst in Paris.
Best Hotel Bar: Bemelmans Bar. in the Carlyle Hotel. Named after book
illustrator Ludwig Bemelmans, who created the Madeline books and
painted the mural in the bar, this romantic, charming bar features white-
gloved service and wondrous cocktails.
Best Hotel Renovation: Carlton Hotel. This former flophouse has been
restored to its 1904 Beaux Arts grandeur by architect David Rockwell. Its
sweeping lobby with a two-story waterfall is a marvel. 
Best Hotel Suite: Townhouse Suite in the Kitano New York. Each of the
three one-bedroom suites built inside the landmark town house that is
part of this hotel feature a long hallway leading to a sunken living room
with original art, a state-of-the-art stereo system, and a tea maker with
green tea.
Best Restaurants
For more information on the restaurants listed, head to Chapter 10.
Best Restaurant: Aquavit. Though its new digs are not nearly as charm-
ing as its former town house setting, the service and the food are as
good as ever.
Best Special Occasion Restaurant: Chanterelle. If you want to impress
that special loved one, you won’t ever go wrong if you choose Chanterelle.
The food is consistently superb, the room lovely and intimate, and the
service impeccable.
Best for Romance: Café des Artistes. If the murals of the naked wood
nymphs don’t get you in the mood, the old school French cooking cou-
pled with traditional, white-gloved service certainly will.
Best Chinese: New York Noodletown. With all the culinary wonders that
Chinatown has to offer, this is a tough choice. Noodletown’s my current
favorite, where the soups are always fresh and comforting and anything
that’s salt-baked is guaranteed to be sublime.
Best French: Daniel. For faultless French cooking, nobody does it better
than Chef Daniel Boulud, especially here at his signature restaurant.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of New York City 17

Best Italian: ’Cesca. It’s difficult to find a restaurant that presents dishes
totally original to New York, but ’Cesca, with its truly farmhouse rustic
cuisine does just that — and very successfully.
Best Mexican: Pampano. Another new arrival in New York, and I, for
one, am grateful for it. Seafood is what they do best here and that
includes the amazing ceviches and the lobster tacos.
Best Seafood: Oceana, You won’t believe what chef Cornelius Gallagher
can do with fish. His culinary creations look so good on the plate that
they are worthy of museum status. What’s really remarkable is that the
food tastes as good as it looks. 
Best Steak: Frankie & Johnnie’s. Whether you choose the former
speakeasy that is the original location in the Theater district or the
newer branch located in actor John Barrymore’s former townhouse,
your steak, particularly the house sirloin, will remind you why Frankie &
Johnnie’s has been around since 1926. 
Best Jewish Deli: Katz’s Delicatessen. This deli’s the choice among
those who know their kreplach, knishes, and pastrami. No cutesy sand-
wiches named for celebrities here — just top-notch Jewish classics.
Best Burger: Burger Joint. Who woulda thunk that a fancy hotel like Le
Parker Meridien would be the home to a place called Burger Joint that
serves great burgers at great prices?
Best Pizza: Patsy’s Pizzeria. This great East Harlem pizzeria has been
cranking out coal-oven pizza since 1932. It was the favorite of Frank
Sinatra, who used to have Patsy’s pizzas packed and shipped to him 
in Vegas.
Best Breakfast: Good Enough to Eat. They’ve been lining up on
Amsterdam Avenue on weekend mornings for over 20 years to get a
taste of chef/owner Carrie Levin’s bountiful home-cooked breakfasts.
Best Dessert: Fiamma Osteria. Many impressive pastry chefs work
around the city, but few of them can top the remarkable Elizabeth Katz.
Her creations make you want to skip the entrees and head straight for
dessert.
Best Ice Cream: Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory. A treat from the Ice Cream
Factory is the perfect reward after a brisk walk across the Brooklyn
Bridge. Rich homemade ice cream with a view of the Manhattan skyline —
that’s a tough combination to beat.
Best Bagel: Absolute Bagels. These aren’t huge, like some bagels you
can find these days, but they’re always hot and baked to perfection.
Best Hot Dog: Gray’s Papaya. The hot dogs are so good here that it’s
tough to eat just one. But even though they’re delicious, stop at two if
you know what’s best for you.
Part I: Introducing New York City 
18

Best Times Square Restaurant: Virgil’s Real BBQ. Times Square is a
restaurant wasteland with bad theme restaurants or overpriced national
chains. Virgil’s, in a sense, is a barbecue-theme restaurant, but they do
an excellent job of smoking meats.
Best New/Old Dining Room: Country. Designed by architect David
Rockwell, the upstairs restaurant in the recently renovated Carlton Hotel
is a marvel with restored mosaic tiles on the floor, dramatic chandeliers,
nooks overlooking the hotel lobby, and most impressive a gorgeous
Tiffany skylight dome that had been hidden for years and uncovered
during the renovation. 
Best Attractions
For more information on the attractions below, please refer to Chapter 11.
Best Attraction: Statue of Liberty. If you have time to do only one thing
on your visit to New York, sail to the Lady in the harbor. No other monu-
ment embodies the nation’s, and the world’s, notion of political freedom
and economic potential more than Lady Liberty. It is also the ultimate
symbol of New York, the personification of the city’s vast diversity and
tolerance.
Best Skyscraper: Empire State Building. Like the Statue of Liberty, the
Empire State Building, once again the tallest building in New York, is one
of the city’s definitive icons. The view from the 86th-floor observatory is
unforgettable.
Best-Looking Building: Chrysler Building. This award goes to the
chrome-topped, gargoyle-laden Art Deco masterpiece, the Chrysler
Building.
Best Historic Building: Grand Central Terminal. Even if you don’t 
have to catch a train, make sure you visit this Beaux Arts gem that was
built in 1913 and beautifully restored in the 1990s to recapture its initial
brilliance.
Best Museum: American Museum of Natural History. You could spend
your entire visit to New York at this 4-square-block museum; there’s that
much to see. From the famed Dinosaur Hall to the adjoining Rose Center
for Earth and Space, the Museum of Natural History houses the world’s
greatest natural science collection.
Best Art Museum: Metropolitan Museum of Art. It’s not only the best
art museum in New York, but the best in North America as well. The
number of masterworks housed here is mind-boggling.
Best Museum for Older Children: Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum. This
humongous retired aircraft carrier offers almost as many thrills as a
theme park. Note: Closed for renovations until 2008.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of New York City 19

Best Museum for Younger Children: Children’s Museum of Manhattan.
This museum is strictly hands-on and designed for ages 2 to 12. Beyond
the normal exhibits, something special is always happening here.
Best Park: Central Park. Though New York has many wonderful parks,
Central Park has no real competition here. It’s one of the world’s great-
est urban refuges, serving as a center of calm and tranquility amongst
the noise and bustle of Manhattan.
Best Location in Central Park for a Picnic: The Pool. At 100th Street,
the Pool is like being in another world. It’s relatively quiet and undiscov-
ered, and with weeping willows, ducks, geese, egrets, and a hawk or two,
this watering hole is an oasis of tranquility.
Best Place to Take the Kids: Central Park. Again, head to Central Park.
With a lovely carousel, a zoo, two ice-skating rinks, and numerous play-
grounds and ball fields, Central Park is a children’s wonderland.
Best Street: Broadway. Fifth Avenue has the reputation, but it has lost
some luster in the past few years with the proliferation of chain and
theme stores, so my pick is Broadway. As it stretches from one end of
Manhattan to the other, no street captures the city’s diversity better than
Broadway.
Best Neighborhood to Stroll: Greenwich Village. Though I’m partial to
the Upper West Side, I have to give the nod here to Greenwich Village.
With its historic streets, hidden cafes, cozy restaurants, and eccentric
characters, Greenwich Village is a constant, but pleasant, barrage on the
senses.
Best Bridge: Brooklyn Bridge. New York is a city of bridges connecting
the various islands to the mainland and beyond. But none equals the
splendor and originality of the Brooklyn Bridge. Walking across it is a
must.
Best Free Attraction: Staten Island Ferry. With views of the Statue of
Liberty, Ellis Island, lower Manhattan, the Verrazano Narrows Bridge,
and the rest of New York Harbor — and the chance to mingle with 
commuters — you can’t beat the price of this ride.
Best Shopping
For more information on the stores listed, skip to Chapter 12.
Best Store: Saks Fifth Avenue. Not as overwhelming as other depart-
ment stores, Saks is consistently good. And don’t miss those window
displays at Christmas.
Best Clothes Store: Barneys. This store is the pinnacle with prices to
match.
Part I: Introducing New York City 
20

Best Bookstore: Coliseum Books. This book-lover’s paradise is a mini-
superstore (if there is such a thing) with the heart of an independent.
Best Music Store: Tower Records. A huge selection and frequent sales
make this my personal favorite.
Best Shopping Zone: SoHo, NoHo, and NoLita. All three neighborhoods
are within easy walking distance of one another and feature the newest,
trendiest boutiques.
Best Culture and Nightlife
For more information on the listings below, jump to Chapters 14 and 15.
Best Performance Space: Carnegie Hall. You can find few greater per-
formance spaces in the world than this one. Visually and acoustically
brilliant, Carnegie Hall regularly attracts an amazing array of talent.
Best Free Cultural Event: Shakespeare in the Park. Imagine Shakespeare
performed by stars, under the stars, in Central Park. No wonder it has
become a New York institution.
Best Children’s Theater: Paper Bag Players. For children ages 4 to 9,
this group performs in the winter only and offers tales told in imagina-
tive and original ways.
Best Jazz Club: Village Vanguard. The acoustics and sight lines aren’t
great, but you can’t do better for finding consistent, good-quality jazz.
Best Rock Club: Mercury Lounge. This venue is intimate, but not
obscure. The Merc is the best for hard-edged rock and roll.
Best Comedy Club: Gotham Comedy Club. Comfortable and sophisti-
cated, this is where the best come to hone their acts.
Best Pub: Ear Inn. Located in an old hanger-on in chic SoHo, I hope it
continues to survive amongst the lush lounges that surround it.
Best Dive Bar: Subway Inn. Sure, I know you came to New York to go to
a dive bar. Enter the Subway Inn, and it’s as if you stepped into a 1940s
moody film noir — minus the cigarette smoke, of course.
Best Bar with a View: Rise Bar, in the Ritz-Carlton Battery Park Hotel.
With views of Lady Liberty, New York Harbor, and incredible sunsets,
this bar is worth seeking out even if you’re not staying at the hotel.
Best Bar for Cocktails: Pegu Club. Owned by former Bememlman’s
master mixologist, Audrey Saunders, the creative cocktails, whether,
shaken, stirred, or poured, are always perfect.

N
ew York is not an obscure destination. Even people in the most
remote parts of the globe know about the Empire State Building
and the Statue of Liberty. But no matter how much you know (or don’t
know) about New York, it may help you to get a little background on the
city before you arrive. Here’s a quick overview — historical timelines,
architectural highlights, culinary tidbits, a recommended reading and
films list — that may help you discover a part of what makes New York
unique.
Hunting Down a Little History
The area that became New York City was the home to many Native
Americans before Giovanni da Verrazano arrived in 1524. Even though
Verrazano didn’t stay, a bridge was named after him. And it wasn’t until
1609, when Henry Hudson, while searching for the Northwest Passage,
claimed it for the Dutch East India Company, that New York was recog-
nized as a potential, profitable settlement in the New World.
Hudson (the river that separates Manhattan from the mainland is named
after him) said of New York, “It is as beautiful a land as one can hope to
tread upon.” The treading didn’t really start until years later, but by
1625, Dutch settlers established a fur trade with the locals and called
their colony New Amsterdam. A year later, Peter Minuit of the Dutch
West India Company made that famous deal for the island. He bought
New Amsterdam from the Lenape Tribe for what has widely been
reported as $24.

New Amsterdam became a British colony in the 1670s, and during the
Revolutionary War it was occupied by British troops. England controlled
New York until 1783 when it withdrew from the city two full years after
the end of the American Revolution. Two years after that, New York was
named the first capital of the United States. The first Congress was held
at Federal Hall on Wall Street in 1789, and George Washington was inau-
gurated president. But New York’s tenure as the capital didn’t last long.
A year later, the government headed south to the newly created District
of Columbia.
By 1825, New York City’s population swelled to 250,000 and rose again to
a half-million by mid-century. The city was a hotbed of Union recruit-
ment during the Civil War; in the 1863 draft riots, Irish immigrants vio-
lently protested the draft and lynched 11 African Americans.
With industry booming, the late 19th century was termed the “Gilded
Age.” New York City was an example of this label in action; millionaires
built mansions on Fifth Avenue, while rows of tenements teeming with
families (made up of the cheap, mostly immigrant laborers who were
employed by the industrial barons) filled the city’s districts. In 1880, the
city’s population boomed to 1.1 million.
More European immigrants poured into the city between 1900 and 1930,
arriving at Ellis Island and then fanning out into neighborhoods like the
Lower East Side, Greenwich Village, Little Italy, and Harlem. With the city
population in 1930 at 7 million and a Depression raging, New York turned

1524 Giovanni da Verrazano sails into New York Harbor.
1609 Henry Hudson sails up the Hudson River.
1621 The Dutch West India Company begins trading from New York City.
1626 The Dutch pay 60 guilders ($24) to the Lenape Tribe for the island of New
Amsterdam.
1664 The Dutch surrender New Amsterdam to the British and the island is
renamed after the brother of King Charles II, The Duke of York.
1765 The Sons of Liberty burn the British Governor in effigy.
1776 Independence from England is declared.
1789 The first Congress is held at Federal Hall on Wall Street, and George
Washington is inaugurated.
1792 The first stock exchange is established on Wall Street.

to a feisty mayor named Fiorello La Guardia for help. With the assistance
of civic planner Robert Moses, who masterminded a huge public works
program, the city was remade. Moses did some things well, but his high-
way, bridge, tunnel, and housing projects ran through (and sometimes
destroyed) many vibrant neighborhoods.
While most of the country prospered after World War II, New York, with
those Moses-built highways and a newly forming car culture, endured an
exodus to the suburbs. By 1958, the Dodgers had left Brooklyn and the
Giants had left the Polo Grounds in Upper Manhattan. This economic
slide climaxed in the late 1970s with the city’s declaration of bankruptcy.
As Wall Street rallied during the Reagan years of the 1980s, New York’s
fortunes also improved. In the 1990s, with Rudolph Giuliani — whom
they haven’t named anything after yet — as the mayor, the city rode a
wave of prosperity that left it safer, cleaner, and more populated. The 
flip side of this boom was that Manhattan became more homogenized.
Witness the Disney-fication of Times Square — the ultimate symbol of
New York’s homogenization — and the growing gap between the rich
and poor.
Everything changed on September 11, 2001, when terrorists flew planes
into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. But New York’s grit 
and verve showed itself once more, as the city immediately began to
rebound emotionally and financially from that terrible tragedy. As this
book goes to press, ground has broken on a memorial, but bickering on
what should be built on the site continues. Stay tuned.

Looking at Local Architecture
I admit it: I’m no architectural scholar. I’m easy. I see a building, and if it
looks old and sturdy and has ornate design, I’m impressed. New York
has many of these buildings, along with a slew of tall, sleek, modern
buildings. The architectural styles in New York are as diverse as the pop-
ulation. Table 2-1 lists some of New York’s more prominent styles, dates,
and structures that represent those styles.

Lauding the Local Cuisine
I dare you to define the local cuisine of New York: Is it a hot dog with
mustard? Pastrami on rye? A bagel and a schmear? A “slice” (of pizza, of
course)? It’s all of them and more. The cuisine of New York is the cuisine
of the world. A little bit of everything goes into the melting pot, and the
mix is constantly changing. A few years ago, you couldn’t get good
Mexican food. Now, with the influx of thousands of Mexican immigrants,
good, authentic Mexican restaurants abound.
But what defines New York cuisine is not just different ethnic foods, but
the different trends, styles, and types of restaurants. Food is important
in New York. And it’s also big business. This is a city where a hamburger
can sell from $3 to $30, or an omelet with mounds of caviar can sell for
$1,000. It’s also the city where you can find a restaurant where the only
item on the menu is peanut butter. Everyone can find something to eat in
New York. For a list of some of New York’s best restaurants in every cate-
gory, see Chapter 10.
Recommending Books and Movies
New York City has inspired writers for hundreds of years, and filmmak-
ers since the invention of the form. You may gain another level of under-
standing of the city by reading or watching some of the following novels,
non-fiction works, or films.
New York City on paper
For the definitive history of New York City from its birth to the end of
the 19th century, you won’t find a better read than the Pulitzer Prize–
winning Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898, by Edwin G.
Burrows and Mike Wallace (Oxford University Press, 1998). Another rec-
ommended historical look at the growth of New York City — this one
Part I: Introducing New York City 
26

told in a breezy narrative tone — is Epic of New York City: A Narrative
History, by Edward Robb Ellis (Kodansha, 1990).
One of master biographer Robert A. Caro’s early works, The Power
Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York (Vintage, 1975),
focuses on how the vision of master builder Robert Moses transformed
New York to what it became in the second half of the 20th century.
In Great Bridge: The Epic Story of the Building of the Brooklyn
Bridge (Simon & Schuster, 1983), David McCullough devotes his
estimable talents to the story of the building of the Brooklyn Bridge.
The companion volume to a PBS Series (see New York: A Documentary
Film later in this chapter), New York: An Illustrated History, by Ric
Burns, Lisa Ades, and James Sanders (Knopf, 2003) uses lavish photo-
graphs and illustrations to show the growth of New York City.
The great essayist E.B. White’s classic, Here is New York (Little
Bookroom, 1999), is as relevant today as it was in 1948 when it was 
written. Another timeless masterpiece is Miroslav Sasek’s illustrated
children’s book from 1960, This is New York (Universe Books, 2003).
Both books are available in recent reprints.
One of New York’s best chronicler’s is long-time newspaperman, Pete
Hamill. His Downtown, (Back Bay Books/Little, Brown and Company,
2004) is a wonderful history of Manhattan from Times Square to Battery
Park. 
New York City on film
Few places are as cinematic as New York City. Filmmakers sometimes
think of the city as a character itself. The list of movies in which New
York plays a crucial role is too long to cover in depth, but some of these
top New York City movies are worth renting before you visit.
Possibly the best New York City promotional film is the musical On The
Town, with Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra. This film is about three sailors
who spend their 24-hour leave exploring Gotham. Shot on location, all
the landmarks, circa 1949, are captured in Technicolor.
Woody Allen is known as a New York filmmaker and proudly shoots all
his films (with the exception of “Match Point,” shot in London) in the
city. One of his best and a good, but maybe a bit dated, look at neurotic
New York is 1977’s Annie Hall.
Following in Woody Allen’s footsteps are director Rob Reiner and writer
Nora Ephron, the team who made When Harry Met Sally in 1989. It’s 
a gorgeous cinematic tribute to New York. By the way, the famous “I’ll
have what she’s having” scene was filmed in Katz’s Delicatessen (see
Chapter 10 for more on this famous deli).
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into New York City 27

“I love this dirty town,” says Burt Lancaster in the gritty, crackling Sweet
Smell of Success. In this beautifully photographed black-and-white
movie from 1957, Lancaster plays malicious gossip columnist J.J.
Hunsecker, and Tony Curtis is perfectly despicable as the groveling 
publicist, Sidney Falco.
Another filmmaker identified with New York is Martin Scorsese. He has
made many films in which New York plays a central role, including Mean
Streets (1973), The Age of Innocence (1993), and 2002’s Gangs of New
York, which was actually filmed in Italy. But the one film where New York
is a character, and not a very flattering one, is Taxi Driver. The Academy
Award–nominated 1976 movie about an alienated and psychotic taxi
driver is tough and bloody, but if you want to see images of pre-cleanup
Times Square, check this film out.
The best history of New York on video is the Ric Burns documentary,
New York: A Documentary Film (1999). The seven-disc, 14-hour DVD
(also available on VHS) with a poignant, post-9/11 epilogue is a must-see
for anyone interested in the evolution of this great city.

Deciding When to Go
In This Chapter
 Choosing the best time to visit New York City
 Keeping your cool (or dressing warmly!)
 Flipping through the calendar of events
B
ecause New York offers such a wide variety of attractions and
sights, people visit the city year-round, regardless of the weather.
In addition to giving you the lowdown on New York life during each
season, this chapter includes a calendar of events if you’d like to plan
your visit around a particular activity.
Revealing the Secrets of the Seasons
Summer or winter, rain or shine, great stuff is always going on in New
York City, so I can’t really tell you a “best” time to go. I can, however,
give you some of the pros and cons, season by season.
Winter: With the exception of the first few weeks in December, winter is
a great time to come to New York if you’re searching for bargains. Hotel
rates are at their lowest, tickets to top shows are attainable, and reser-
vations at the best restaurants are very manageable. But if your idea of a
vacation doesn’t involve walking around bundled in layers of protective
clothing to insulate you from the biting cold, then don’t come during a
New York winter.
Spring: This is the wettest time of year, but in between the showers, the
flowers in the park bloom and the temperatures are more pedestrian-
friendly. As a result, the tourists make their way back to the city and
hotel rates begin to rise, especially in late spring.
Summer: The city is sticky, streets begin to radiate a pungent stench,
and tempers can be testy. Why then, do I love the summer in New York
so much? Because I’ve got so many free outdoor events, like concerts
and plays, to choose from. Restaurants are less crowded, museums and
other attractions are more manageable, I can picnic in Central Park, and
I can walk around in shorts, sandals, and a T-shirt.

Fall: With mild temperatures and dry days, fall is New York’s best weather
season. But it’s also the busiest time of year in the city. Everyone is back
to school or work; street fairs continue through the early fall; and reserva-
tions at restaurants and hotels are tougher to snag. You’ll also be hard-
pressed to find bargains during this period.
To get an idea of the kind of temperatures and weather you may experi-
ence during a particular month in New York, take a look at Table 3-1.

Part II
Planning Your Trip to 
New York City

In this part . . . 
I
suggest ways to get the most value out of your travel
budget and prepare you for how much things cost in New
York City. I also discuss your options for getting to New York
City, whether you’re ﬂying, driving, or taking the train.
I also discuss planning resources that can be a big help for
families, seniors, travelers with disabilities, and gay and les-
bian travelers coming to the city.
Finally, I discuss the important details, from renting a car to
travel insurance, staying in touch with home, and following
the latest information on airline security.

Chapter 4
Managing Your Money
In This Chapter
 Deciding how to spend your money
 Cutting the costs, but not the fun
 Getting, carrying, and keeping your funds
N
ew York has a way of devouring your cash. With almost as many
ATMs (and their accompanying fees) as there are things to spend
money on, the Big Apple can be a big budget-buster. But as long as you set
realistic goals for your spending and plan ahead, you don’t have to worry
about mortgaging the house to finance your trip. In this chapter, I share
ways you can get the best value for your dollars without going broke.
Planning Your Budget
New York has a reputation as one of the most expensive cities to live in,
not only in the United States, but in the world. So dismiss any notions
that you can get off on the very cheap here. But that reputation is also
exaggerated; you can spend a week in the Big Apple for somewhat less
than a king’s ransom. In fact, you can make your trip to New York wallet-
friendly in lots of ways. You just have to know what you’re doing and do
a bit of groundwork.
Hotel
The biggest challenge in terms of saving money in New York is finding an
affordable place to stay. As I discuss in Chapter 9, a decent hotel room in
New York can run at least $150 per night, including a hotel tax of 15.25
percent. This expense is the biggest drain on your budget unless you
want to share a bathroom or explore a youth hostel — and you don’t
want to do that, do you? So definitely look for bargains, but do be realis-
tic. A hotel room is going to cost you some dough.
Transportation
First off, pack comfortable walking shoes — walking is the preferred
mode of transportation in New York. Next, invest in a MetroCard (the
major form of admittance to New York’s public transportation). One ride
on the subway costs $2 (although you can purchase an “unlimited”

MetroCard . . . more about that in Chapter 8), and if you transfer to a bus,
the transfer is free with MetroCard. The New York subway system is a
marvel. At times it is overcrowded (try to avoid riding on it at rush hour),
and in the summer, the stations can be extremely toasty (even though all
the trains are air-conditioned), but no other means of transportation can
get you to your destination within the city cheaper and faster. See
Chapter 8 for more information about getting around New York.
Buses, which accept both MetroCards and exact change, are also an
inexpensive alternative to the subway and a nice way to see the city. But
with many stops and the regular heavy traffic in Manhattan, they can be
extremely slow.
Yellow cabs are the city’s other great resource. They’re usually plentiful —
they say approximately 19,000 cabs are on the streets at any given time —
and you can usually get a cab without too much hassle (except on rainy
days and at the pre-theater hour). Cabs offer relatively affordable rides,
particularly if you’re in a group of up to three people. They’re also the
most convenient way to get to parts of town where the subway doesn’t 
go. You pay $2.50 as soon as the cabbie turns on the meter, plus 40¢ per 
1⁄5 mile or 30¢ per minute when stuck in traffic. There’s also a 50¢ nighttime
surcharge and a $1 surcharge Monday through Friday, from 4 to 8 p.m.
As signs all over Manhattan say: “Don’t Even THINK About Parking
Here.” If you’re considering renting a car in New York or using your own
car for transportation around town, think again. (Find more discussion
on parking and driving in Chapter 7.)
Food
You can get every conceivable kind of food in New York at just about any
price. We all know about those three- and four-star restaurants that may
cost more than two nights at a New York hotel, but not as well-known
are those hidden gems (and there are plenty) that cost you less than $20
for an excellent meal. If you want to save even more, you can always get
pizza, bagels, hot dogs, falafel, and other (surprisingly) good street food
throughout New York to satisfy your hunger pangs. Chapter 10 offers
tips on selecting food that fits both your appetite and your budget.
Sights
Entrance fees vary from attraction to attraction. If you’re planning on visit-
ing a lot of them, consider buying a CityPass, which gets you reduced
admission to six of the city’s top attractions for $63 (a savings of more
than 50 percent of what you would pay for separate admissions). See
Chapter 11 for more information about places and things to see in the city.
Some attractions request a suggested contribution for admission, which
means that you can pay whatever you want. But be reasonable — if you
offer up a couple of dollars to get a family of six into the Metropolitan
Museum, you’re likely to get a sneer with your tickets. Some museums
also offer a free admission night, which, for obvious reasons, is usually
Part II: Planning Your Trip to New York City 
38

the busiest night of the week. See the individual museum listings in
Chapter 11 for details.
Shopping
When it comes to shopping, only you know how much you want to
spend. You can find bargains in New York on electronics, CDs, and
because of the many options, clothes as well. But unless you happen
upon a sample sale or another sale, top designer duds are going to cost
you. (Of course, you can buy designer knockoffs on the street, but the
quality is somewhat less than the real thing, to say the least.)
Nightlife
Again, how much you spend on nightlife entertainment depends on what
you’re interested in doing. At the top end are Broadway shows, which
average $75 and up for the best orchestra seats, and supper clubs where
you can see a cabaret act for around $60, not including drinks. If you just
want to people-watch at a wine bar or pub around happy hour, you’ll be
hard-pressed to spend more than $20.

Taxes
Regular sales tax is 8.65 percent — not a small amount, especially if you
buy expensive stuff. Remember that advertised prices, from restaurants
to hotels to most shops, almost always exclude sales tax. The prices in
this book also do not include sales tax.
Year round there is no tax on clothing and footwear under $110 in New
York City.
Hotel taxes run 15.25 percent. If you think this seems ridiculous, be glad
that you didn’t plan your trip a few years ago, when the hotel tax was
19.25 percent! (Occasionally, things in New York do get cheaper.) A room
charge of $2 per night is also added to your bill. Remember to ask
whether the price quoted to you includes these additional amounts, both
for travel packages and hotel rooms; they can make quite a difference.
Tips
Bottom line: Expect to tip for every service you get in New York. Use the
following guidelines when tipping:
 Waiters: Simply double the tax on your bill and round up to the
nearest dollar (which is a tip of about 17 percent). Often, restau-
rants add the tip (15 to 20 percent) to the bill automatically for par-
ties of six or more.
 Bartenders: If you’re just drinking at a bar, 10 to 15 percent takes
care of it.
 Taxi drivers: No matter how bumpy the ride, tip 15 percent.
 Everybody else: Bellhops get $1 or $2 per bag; maids get $1 per
day; coat-check people get $1 per garment; and automobile valets
get $1.
Cutting Costs, But Not the Fun
You can cut costs in plenty of ways — some little and some big. Note the
Bargain Alert icons scattered throughout this book, which offer hints on
ways to trim the fat from your budget. While you’re planning a trip, keep
a few things in mind:
 Travel at off-peak times. Although New York doesn’t have a real off
season, the prices at some hotels during nonpeak times are half of
what they are during the peak travel seasons. See Chapter 3 for a
discussion of the New York travel seasons.
 Try a package tour. For many destinations, you can book airfare,
hotel, ground transportation, and even some sightseeing just by
making one call to a travel agent or packager, for a price much less
Part II: Planning Your Trip to New York City 
40

than if you put the trip together yourself. (See Chapter 5 for more
on package tours.)
 Reserve a room with a refrigerator and coffeemaker. You don’t
have to slave over a hot stove to cut a few costs; several motels
have minifridges and coffeemakers. Buying supplies for breakfast
will save you money.
 Always ask for discount rates. Membership in AAA, frequent-flier
plans, trade unions, AARP, or other groups may qualify you for sav-
ings on car rentals, plane tickets, hotel rooms, and even meals. Ask
about everything; you may be pleasantly surprised.
 Ask if your kids can stay in the room with you. A room with two
double beds usually doesn’t cost any more than one with a queen-
size bed. And many hotels won’t charge you the additional person
rate if the additional person is pint-size and related to you. Even if
you have to pay $10 or $15 extra for a rollaway bed, you’ll save
hundreds by not taking two rooms.
 Try expensive restaurants at lunch instead of dinner. Lunch tabs
are usually a fraction of what dinner costs at most restaurants, and
the menu often offers many of the same specialties, only sometimes
in smaller portions. Many of New York’s best restaurants partici-
pate in Restaurant Week in January and June — $20 and some
change nets you a two- or three-course lunch — and some extend
this fixed-price bargain throughout the summer or even year-round.
 Don’t use the hotel phone. Some hotels in the moderate-to-
expensive range now offer free local calls from rooms, but don’t
count on it. Instead, if you have one, bring your cellphone and use
it. See Chapter 7 for more info.
 Stay away from the minibar. I know it’s tempting, but if you want a
snack, pick one up at the closest deli. Open that minibar and crack
open that can of peanuts . . . and then a beer, and before long
you’ve spent $20 on a snack.
 Use the buses and subways. Taxis get expensive quickly, especially
in gridlock traffic. See Chapter 8 for hints on navigating the public
transit system.
 Buy a daily or weekly MetroCard pass. See Chapter 8 for more info
about the MetroCard and its budget-saving powers.
 Walk a lot. A good pair of walking shoes can save lots of money in
taxis and other local transportation. As a bonus, you get to know
your surroundings more intimately because you explore at a slower
pace.
 Seek out small, local restaurants. Often not only is the food less
expensive, but it’s also better than some of what you get at the big-
name tourist traps. Turn to Chapter 10 for suggestions.
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 41

 Visit museums that have a “suggested donation,” or go on the
nights that are free. See Chapter 11 to find out which days and
nights are free at my favorite museums.
 Buy your Broadway and Off-Broadway tickets at TKTS. You can
get same-day performances for some of Broadway’s best shows by
standing in line at the TKTS booth in Times Square or downtown at
the South Street Seaport. See Chapter 14 for more info.
 Buy your drinks at happy hour. Many bars throughout the city
have happy hours, usually between the hours of 4 to 8 p.m. or there-
abouts, when you can save considerably on the price of a drink.
 Go to jazz clubs early in the week, when many do not have cover
charges. See Chapter 15 for more info.
Handling Money
New York is one of the safest cities in the country, but that doesn’t mean
you should go around carrying wads of cash (although you should always
make sure you have at least $20 in taxi fare on hand). Below are the best
ways to access money in New York.
You’re the best judge of how much cash you feel comfortable carrying 
or what alternative form of currency is your favorite. That’s not going 
to change much on your vacation. True, you’re probably going to be
moving around more and incurring more expenses than you generally 
do (unless you happen to eat out every meal when you’re at home), and
you may let your mind slip into vacation gear and not be as vigilant
about your safety as when you’re in work mode. But, those factors aside,
the only type of payment that isn’t quite as easy to use when you’re
away from home is your personal checkbook; remember, some places
don’t accept out-of-town checks.
Using ATMs and carrying cash
The easiest and best way to get cash away from home is from an ATM
(automated teller machine), sometimes referred to as a “cash machine,”
or “cashpoint.” The Cirrus (% 800-424-7787; www.mastercard.com)
and PLUS (% 800-843-7587; www.visa.com) networks span the globe;
look at the back of your bank card to see which network you’re on, then
call or check online for ATM locations at your destination. Be sure you
know your personal identification number (PIN) before you leave home
and be sure to find out your daily withdrawal limit before you depart.
Also keep in mind that many banks impose a fee every time your card is
used at a different bank’s ATM, and that fee can be higher for interna-
tional transactions (up to $5 or more) than for domestic ones (they’re
rarely more than $1.50). On top of this, the bank from which you with-
draw cash may charge its own fee. To compare banks’ ATM fees within
the U.S., use www.bankrate.com. For international withdrawal fees, ask
your bank.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to New York City 
42

If your own bank doesn’t have branches in New York, call to find out if
it’s affiliated with a bank in the city. Doing so may save you the extra
$1.50 or more charge for using a nonaffiliated ATM. Many banks limit the
amount of money per day that you can withdraw from an ATM; before
you depart, be sure you know your bank’s daily withdrawal limit.
ATMs are everywhere in New York, including in banks, supermarkets,
and delis. You can get cash at any hour of the day or night, but you pay 
a higher surcharge at the non-bank affiliated ATMs. Some clubs (where
there’s no reentry after you leave) have up to a $5 surcharge, so make
sure you have enough cash on you when you go in. 
Charging ahead with credit cards
Credit cards are a safe way to carry money: They also provide a conven-
ient record of all your expenses, and they generally offer relatively good
exchange rates. You can also withdraw cash advances from your credit
cards at banks or ATMs, provided you know your PIN. If you’ve forgotten
yours, or didn’t even know you had one, call the number on the back of
your credit card and ask the bank to send it to you. It usually takes five
to seven business days, though some banks will provide the number
over the phone if you tell them your mother’s maiden name or some
other personal information. 
Some credit cards let you get cash advances at ATMs. However, interest
rates for cash advances are often significantly higher than rates for
credit card purchases. More importantly, you start paying interest on
the advance the moment you receive the cash.
Toting traveler’s checks
These days, traveler’s checks are less necessary because most cities
have 24-hour ATMs that allow you to withdraw small amounts of cash as
needed. However, keep in mind that you will likely be charged an ATM
withdrawal fee if the bank is not your own, so if you’re withdrawing
money every day, you might be better off with traveler’s checks — 
provided that you don’t mind showing identification every time you
want to cash one. 
You can get traveler’s checks at almost any bank. American Express
offers denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and (for cardholders only)
$1,000. You’ll pay a service charge ranging from 1 percent to 4 percent.
You can also get American Express traveler’s checks over the phone by
calling % 800-221-7282; Amex gold and platinum cardholders who use
this number are exempt from the 1 percent fee. 
Visa offers traveler’s checks at Citibank locations nationwide, as well as
at several other banks. The service charge ranges between 1.5 percent
and 2 percent; checks come in denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500,
and $1,000. Call % 800-732-1322 for information. AAA members can
obtain Visa checks for a $9.95 fee at most AAA offices or by calling 
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 43

% 866-339-3378. MasterCard also offers traveler’s checks. Call % 800-
223-9920 for a location near you. 
If you choose to carry traveler’s checks, be sure to keep a record of their
serial numbers separate from your checks in the event that they are
stolen or lost. You’ll get a refund faster if you know the numbers.
Dealing with a lost or stolen wallet 
Be sure to contact all of your credit card companies the minute you dis-
cover your wallet has been lost or stolen and file a report at the nearest
police precinct. Your credit card company or insurer may require a
police report number or record of the loss. Most credit card companies
have an emergency toll-free number to call if your card is lost or stolen;
they may be able to wire you a cash advance immediately or deliver an
emergency credit card in a day or two. Call the following emergency
numbers in the United States:
 American Express % 800-221-7282 (for cardholders and traveler’s
check holders)
 MasterCard % 800-307-7309 or 636-722-7111
 Visa % 800-847-2911 or 410-581-9994

Getting to New York City
In This Chapter
 Taking a plane, train, or automobile
 Choosing between a package or escorted tour
 Finding the best package or tour for your needs
You can get to New York in a variety of ways, depending on where
you’re starting from. Choosing the best mode of transit for your
needs and preference depends on distance, convenience, and cost. Are
you willing to arrange your own transportation? Or would you prefer to
have someone else make all the arrangements (such as a travel agent or
tour company)? When you arrive, do you want to explore the city by
yourself? Or do you want the company of a group? In this chapter, I give
you the pros and cons of each option.
Choosing the Airport
Three major airports serve New York City: LaGuardia, JFK (aka Kennedy
or John. F. Kennedy), and Newark Liberty. The city is easily accessible
from all three (see Chapter 8 for details on transportation between air-
port and city), although choosing to arrive at one or another may affect
the price of your ticket. If you’re looking for the best price, be flexible and
accept a flight to any of these three airports. However, if saving money
isn’t your first priority, you may want to consider these differences:
 LaGuardia Airport, in northern Queens, is the closest airport to
Manhattan (therefore, the cab rides from the city are cheaper and
get you to and from the airport faster). It’s also the smallest of the
three. Although the number of flights allowed to arrive here has
increased in recent years, the choices are more limited than at the
other two airports. This is primarily a domestic, not an interna-
tional, airport. Also, the increased number of flights has led to an
increase in delays.
 John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), in southern Queens,
is the official international airport for New York. Its international
status makes it the largest and busiest airport in the metro area in
terms of the volume of arrivals and departures (although Newark

rivals it). Also, of the three major airports, it’s the farthest from the
city center.
 Newark International Airport is in New Jersey but is somewhat
closer to Manhattan than JFK, especially if your accommodations
are on the West Side or downtown.
Two other airports in outlying areas service New York City: Westchester
Airport in White Plains, New York (25 miles north of the city), and
MacArthur Airport in Islip, Long Island (50 miles east of the city).
MacArthur is the closest airport that budget carrier Southwest Airlines
services. However, the inconvenience and high cost of getting into the
city from these out-of-the-way airports far outweigh the money you save
by using them.
Flying to New York
If you’re in the Northeast or mid-Atlantic, flying may be only one of your
options for reaching New York City (see the sections following on arriv-
ing by car, train, and bus). If, however, you’re coming from further away,
then flying is probably your best bet. You have a lot of options when it
comes to airlines, number of flights, and price range (from no-frills to
first-class).
Finding out which airlines fly there
Almost every major domestic carrier serves at least one of the New
York–area airports; most serve two or all three. The major ones include
 American (% 817-433-7300; www.aa.com)
 America West (% 800-235-9292; www.americawest.com)
 Continental (% 800-525-0280; www.continental.com)
 Delta (% 800-221-1212; www.delta.com)
 Northwest (% 800-225-2525; www.nwa.com)
 United (% 800-241-6522; www.united.com)
 US Airways (% 800-428-4322; www.usairways.com)
In addition to the domestic airlines, many international carriers serve
JFK and Newark airports. Among the ones who offer the most frequent
service are
 Aer Lingus (% 800-474-7424 or 01-886-8888; www.aerlingus.ie)
 Air Canada (% 888-247-2262; www.aircanada.ca)
 Air New Zealand (% 0800-737-767; www.airnewzealand.co.nz)
 British Airways (% 0845-77-333-77; www-britishairways.com)
Part II: Planning Your Trip to New York City 
46

 Qantas (% 612-9691-3636 or 800-227-4500; www.qantas.com.au)
 Virgin Atlantic (% 0870-380-2007; www.virgin-atlantic.com)
The “no-frills” airlines like JetBlue (% 800-JETBLUE; www.jetblue.
com); Airtran (% 800-AIRTRAN; www.airtran.com); ATA (% 800-I-Fly-
ATA; www.ata.com); and Independence Air (% 1-800-FLY-FLYi; www.
flyi.com) frequently offer rock-bottom rates to New York City from des-
tinations across the country. If you like flying Southwest, the nearest
that budget carrier comes to New York City is MacArthur Airport on
Long Island, about 50 miles east of New York City.
Getting the best deal on your airfare
Competition among the major U.S. airlines is unlike that of any other
industry. Every airline offers virtually the same product (basically, a
coach seat is a coach seat is a . . .), yet prices can vary by hundreds of
dollars.
Business travelers who need the flexibility to buy their tickets at the last
minute and change their itineraries at a moment’s notice — and who
want to get home before the weekend — pay (or at least their companies
pay) the premium rate, known as the full fare. But if you can book your
ticket far in advance, stay over Saturday night, and are willing to travel
midweek (Tues, Wed, or Thurs), you can qualify for the least expensive
price — usually a fraction of the full fare. On most flights, even the short-
est hops within the United States, the full fare is close to $1,000 or more,
but a 7- or 14-day advance purchase ticket may cost less than half of that
amount. Obviously, planning ahead pays.
The airlines also periodically hold sales, in which they lower the prices 
on their most popular routes. These sale fares have advance purchase
requirements and date-of-travel restrictions, but you can’t beat the prices.
As you plan your vacation, keep your eyes open for these sales, which
tend to take place in seasons of low travel volume — January through
March here in New York. You almost never see a sale around the peak
summer vacation months of July and August, or around Thanksgiving or
Christmas, when many people fly, regardless of the fare they have to pay.
Consolidators, also known as bucket shops, are great sources for interna-
tional tickets, although they usually can’t beat the Internet on fares
within North America. Start by looking in Sunday newspaper travel sec-
tions; U.S. travelers should focus on the New York Times, Los Angeles
Times, and Miami Herald.
Bucket shop tickets are usually nonrefundable or rigged with stiff cancel-
lation penalties, often as high as 50 percent to 75 percent of the ticket
price, and some put you on charter airlines with questionable safety
records.
Chapter 5: Getting to New York City 47

Frequent-flier membership doesn’t cost a cent, but it does entitle you to
better seats, faster response to phone inquiries, and prompter service if
your luggage is lost or stolen, or your flight is canceled or delayed, or if
you want to change your seat. And you don’t have to fly to earn points;
frequent-flier credit cards can earn you thousands of miles for doing
your everyday shopping. With more than 70 mileage awards programs on
the market, consumers have never had more options. Investigate the pro-
gram details of your favorite airlines before you sink points into any one.
Consider which airlines have hubs in the airport nearest you, and, of
those carriers, which have the most advantageous alliances, given your
most common routes. To play the frequent-flier game to your best advan-
tage, consult Randy Petersen’s Inside Flyer (www.insideflyer.com).
Petersen and friends review all the programs in detail and post regular
updates on changes in policies and trends.
Several reliable consolidators are worldwide and available on the Net.
STA Travel (% 800-781-4040; www.statravel.com), the world’s leader
in student travel, offers good fares for travelers of all ages. Flights.com
(% 312-332-0090; www.flights.com) started in Europe and has excel-
lent fares worldwide. FlyCheap (% 800-FLY-CHEAP or 800-359-2432;
www.flycheap.com) is owned by package-holiday megalith MyTravel
and so has especially good access to fares for sunny destinations. Air
Tickets Direct (% 888-858-8884; www.airticketsdirect.com) is
based in Montreal and leverages the currently weak Canadian dollar for
low fares.
Booking your flight online
The “big three” online travel agencies, Expedia (www.expedia.com),
Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), and Orbitz (www.orbitz.com)
sell most of the air tickets bought on the Internet. (Canadian travelers
should try www.expedia.ca and www.travelocity.ca; U.K. residents
can go to www.expedia.co.uk and www.opodo.co.uk.) Each has differ-
ent business deals with the airlines and may offer different fares on the
same flights, so shopping around is wise. Expedia and Travelocity also
send you an e-mail notification when a cheap fare becomes available 
to your favorite destination. Of the smaller travel agency Web sites,
SideStep (www.sidestep.com) receives good reviews from users. It’s a
browser add-on that purports to “search 140 sites at once,” but in reality
it only beats competitors’ fares as often as other sites do.
If you’re willing to give up some control over your flight details, use an
opaque fare service, like Priceline (www.priceline.com) or Hotwire
(www.hotwire.com). Both offer rock-bottom prices in exchange for
travel on a “mystery airline” at a mysterious time of day, often with a
mysterious change of planes en route. The airlines are all major, well-
known carriers — and the possibility of being sent from Philadelphia 
to Chicago via Tampa is remote. But your chances of getting a 6 a.m. or
11 p.m. flight are pretty high. Hotwire tells you flight prices before you
buy; Priceline usually has better deals than Hotwire, but you have 
to play their “name your price” game. Note: In 2004, Priceline added 
Part II: Planning Your Trip to New York City 
48

non-opaque service to its roster. You now have the option to pick exact
flights, times, and airlines from a list of offers — or opt to bid on opaque
fares as before.
Great last-minute deals are also available directly from the airlines them-
selves through a free e-mail service called E-savers. Each week, the airline
sends you a list of discounted flights, usually leaving the upcoming Friday
or Saturday and returning the following Monday or Tuesday. You can sign
up for all the major airlines at one time by logging on to Smarter Travel
(www.smartertravel.com), or you can go to each individual airline’s
Web site. Airline sites also offer schedules, flight booking, and information
on late-breaking bargains.
Other helpful Web sites for booking airline tickets online include

Driving to New York City
If you’re visiting New York from the Northeast or mid-Atlantic, certainly
consider driving your car; but just as certainly, park it after you get here.
Some long-term outdoor lots charge less than $35 a day for parking. You
can find these lots along the West Side Highway and in the 50s west of
Eighth Avenue. Also ask if your hotel has an arrangement with a nearby
parking lot for a discount on their daily rate. Most do, but you may not
have in-and-out privileges.
You also can park near a commuter train station in New York, New Jersey,
or Connecticut and take the commuter rail into the city. You still have to
find parking near the station, but it’s somewhat cheaper than parking in
Manhattan. For information about PATH train stations in New Jersey, con-
tact the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey (% 800-234-PATH or
800-234-7284; www.panynj.gov). The Metropolitan Transportation
Authority (MTA) New York City Transit (www.mta.info) operates not
only the city’s subways and buses but also the Long Island Rail Road 
(% 718-217-LIRR or 718-217-5477), which serves Long Island, and the
Metro-North Railroad (% 212-532-4900), which serves upstate New York
and Connecticut.
Chapter 5: Getting to New York City 49

In all cases, plan your arrival to avoid rush hours. Traffic jams in New
York can be dreadful at the points of connection between the island of
Manhattan and the surrounding metropolitan area (where all the air-
ports are located). At rush hour, tunnels and bridges completely clog 
up. And don’t think that you can get around the traffic by “reverse 
commuting” — coming into the city when everybody is leaving —
because it doesn’t work that way. Even if most of the traffic is outbound
at around 5 p.m., a significant number of people commute back to
Manhattan and the number of inbound lanes is actually reduced to help
the traffic that’s leaving get out more quickly.
Try to arrive well outside the peak hours of 8 to 10 a.m. and 4:30 to 7 p.m.
The weekend rush is the worst. In summer, outbound traffic starts as
early as 2 p.m. on Fridays, and inbound traffic on Sunday evenings is
absolutely nightmarish.
Arriving by Other Means
If you don’t want to fly or drive, many modes of land-based transporta-
tion service New York City.
By train
New York is well served by Amtrak (% 800-USA-RAIL or 800-872-7245;
www.amtrak.com). The most convenient route to New York City is the
Northeast Corridor line, which runs between Washington, D.C. and
Boston. If you’re coming from anywhere on this line, taking the train is a
lot smarter than taking a plane. The ride is likely to be shorter: You don’t
have to commute in traffic to and from the airport; you don’t need to be
there two hours in advance to check in and pass through security, and
there’s no waiting on the other end to collect your luggage. The train is
also more comfortable — no dry airplane air, more freedom to stroll
along the aisle, more room to work or sleep, and so on. Be sure to book
in advance.
The train isn’t necessarily cheaper, though. Prices on Amtrak remain
high, but it offers specials and package tours that are worth looking into.
Call % 800-872-7245 for information about special rates, or check the
Web site.
Amtrak trains arrive at Penn Station on the West Side, a hub for land
transportation in the heart of the city. The average round-trip fare to
New York on regular trains is around $126 from Boston (a 41⁄2-hour jour-
ney); $168 and up from Chicago (a 16- to 18-hour trip, usually overnight);
and $142 from Washington, D.C. (about 31⁄2 hours). Note that these are
coach fares, which means (except for Chicago) that seats are unreserved
and not guaranteed (that is, if all the seats are full, you have to stand).
You can reserve a seat in the pricier business-class and first-class
wagons if you don’t want to risk standing.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to New York City 
50

Amtrak has instituted new security measures: To buy a ticket, you must
show a photo ID, such as a driver’s license or passport.
Amtrak’s Acela (www.acela.com) express train cuts down on travel
time, although you pay for that perk. For example, the New York–Boston
run costs about $220 round-trip. Travel on Acela between Washington,
D.C., and New York takes about 2 hours and 45 minutes; between Boston
and New York about 3 hours.
By bus
The bus can be a viable option for getting to New York City if you’re
coming from as far north as Boston, as far south as Washington, D.C.,
and as far west as the middle of Pennsylvania. Offering express bus serv-
ice from several northeastern and mid-Atlantic cities, Peter Pan Bus
Lines (% 800-237-8747; www.peterpanbus.com) features wide-bodied
coaches equipped with video cassette players (which show movies
during the trip), climate control, and plenty of overhead storage com-
partments. Buses arrive at the Port Authority Bus Terminal at 42nd
Street and Eighth Avenue, connecting directly to subways, city buses,
and taxis.
For other regional bus companies (there are more than 20) that offer
runs to New York City, check with the Port Authority (% 212-564-8484;
www.panynj.gov/tbt/pabframe.HTM).
The bus is probably the cheapest way to reach New York from most cities
in the Northeast (with discount fares available for seniors, students, and
children). Travel time from Washington D.C. to New York City is between
three and four hours, from Philadelphia usually less than two hours.
If you decide to ride the bus to New York City, make sure of two things:
 Book your trip on an express bus, or you’ll spend a few more hours
getting there.
 Try to get on a Peter Pan bus. Greyhound/Trailways runs on the
same line and books through the same Web site, but their buses
aren’t nearly as comfortable as Peter Pan buses, and you may end
up in the middle of, say, the Maine to Miami run. (The code on the
Web site is PPP for Peter Pan, GLI for Greyhound/Trailways).
Joining an Escorted Tour
You may be one of the many people who love escorted tours. The tour
company takes care of all the details and tells you what to expect at
each leg of your journey. You know your costs upfront, and you don’t get
many surprises. Escorted tours can take you to the maximum number of
sights in the minimum amount of time with the least amount of hassle.
Chapter 5: Getting to New York City 51

If you decide to go with an escorted tour, I strongly recommend purchas-
ing travel insurance, especially if the tour operator asks to you pay
upfront. But don’t buy insurance from the tour operator! If the tour oper-
ator doesn’t fulfill its obligation to provide you with the vacation you
paid for, don’t think that it’ll fulfill its insurance obligations either. Get
travel insurance through an independent agency. (I tell you more about
the ins and outs of travel insurance in Chapter 7.)
When choosing an escorted tour, along with finding out whether you
have to put down a deposit and when final payment is due, ask a few
simple questions before you buy:
 What is the cancellation policy? Can they cancel the trip if they
don’t get enough people? How late can you cancel if you’re unable
to go? Do you get a refund if you cancel? If they cancel?
 How jam-packed is the schedule? Does the tour schedule try to fit
25 hours into a 24-hour day? If getting up at 7 a.m. every day and
not returning to your hotel until 6 or 7 p.m. sounds like a grind, cer-
tain escorted tours may not be for you.
 How large is the group? The smaller the group, the less time you
spend waiting for people to get on and off your bus or public trans-
portation. Tour operators may be evasive about this, because they
may not know the exact size of the group until everybody has made
reservations, but they should be able to give you a rough estimate.
Also, get an idea of the general age range of the group; whether the
tour’s geared to seniors, students, families, or some other demo-
graphic may affect your decision to sign up.
 Is there a minimum group size? Some tours have a minimum
group size and may cancel the tour if they don’t book enough
people. If a quota exists, find out what it is and how close the oper-
ator is to reaching it. Again, tour operators may be evasive in their
answers, but the information may help you select a tour that’s sure
to happen.
 What exactly is included? Don’t assume anything. You may have 
to pay to get yourself to and from the airport. A box lunch may be
included in an excursion, but drinks may be extra. How much flexi-
bility do you have? Can you opt out of certain activities, or does
the bus leave once a day with no exceptions? Are all your meals
planned in advance? Can you choose your entree at dinner?
Depending on your recreational passions, I recommend one of the fol-
lowing tour companies:
 Globus (% 866-755-8581; www.globusandcosmos.com) sometimes
runs first-class independent tours of New York (often as part of a
larger, multi-city itinerary). A “host” is available to answer questions
Part II: Planning Your Trip to New York City 
52

but doesn’t take you around the city, except on a designated day.
The package includes everything — hotel, local transportation, and
even tips. Check the Web site for the most up-to-date tour offerings.
 Maupintour (% 800-255-4266 or 913-843-1211; www.maupintour.
com) specializes in lavish “grand tours.” These escorted tours often
feature Broadway shows and an excursion to the Hudson Valley.
The cost of a tour may run about $2,000 per person depending on
the options you select, plus airfare.
Choosing a Package Tour
For lots of destinations, package tours can be a smart way to go. In many
cases, a package tour that includes airfare, hotel, and transportation to
and from the airport costs less than the hotel alone on a tour you book
yourself. That’s because packages are sold in bulk to tour operators,
who resell them to the public.
Package tours can vary a good bit in terms of what’s provided. Some
offer a better class of hotels than others; others provide the same hotels
for lower prices. Some book flights on scheduled airlines; others sell
charters. In some packages, your choice of accommodations and travel
days may be limited. Some let you choose between escorted vacations
and independent vacations; others allow you to add on just a few excur-
sions or escorted day trips (also at discounted prices) without booking
an entirely escorted tour.
To find package tours, check out the travel section of your local Sunday
newspaper or the ads in the back of national travel magazines such as
Travel + Leisure, National Geographic Traveler, and Condé Nast Traveler.
Liberty Travel (call % 888-271-1584 to find the store nearest you; www.
libertytravel.com) is one of the biggest packagers in the Northeast
and usually boasts a full-page ad in Sunday papers.
Other good sources of package deals are the airlines themselves. Most
major airlines offer air/land packages, including American Airlines
Vacations (% 800-321-2121; www.aavacations.com), Delta Vacations
(% 800-221-6666; www.deltavacations.com), Continental Airlines
Vacations (% 800-301-3800; www.covacations.com), and United
Vacations (% 888-854-3899; www.unitedvacations.com). Several big
online travel agencies — Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz, Site59, and
Lastminute.com — also do a brisk business in packages. If you’re unsure
about the pedigree of a smaller packager, check with the Better Business
Bureau in the city where the company is based, or go online at www.
bbb.org. If a packager won’t tell you where it’s based, don’t purchase
anything from it.

N
ew York may seem intimidating, but if you can get over your initial
awe, you may find that things are easier for people with special
needs here than in other cities. New York offers so many things to see
and do that anybody can find something suitable, and specialized serv-
ices are available for just about everything and everyone.
Traveling with the Brood: Advice for Families
Forget Disney World — New York is the true kid capital of the United
States. And don’t believe the hype about it being unsafe. As long as 
parents — and children — come prepared, you can have a safe, enjoy-
able, enriching experience that the kids will long remember.
You can find good family-oriented vacation advice on the Internet at
sites, such as the Family Travel Forum (www.familytravelforum.
com), a comprehensive site that offers customized trip planning; Family
Travel Network (www.familytravelnetwork.com), an award-winning
site that offers travel features, deals, and tips; Traveling Internationally
with Your Kids (www.travelwithyourkids.com), a comprehensive site
that offers customized trip planning; and Family Travel Files (www.
thefamilytravelfiles.com), which offers an online magazine and a
directory of off-the-beaten-path tours and tour operators for families.
Parents should research all the places the family plans to visit; see
Chapter 8 for descriptions of New York’s neighborhoods. Parents and
children should go over safety issues before leaving (see the Quick
Concierge); be sure to create a plan so that children know what to do 
if they get lost.

Finding a family-friendly hotel
Finding a hotel that caters to children may be your biggest concern when
traveling to New York. But you’re in luck — some New York hotels market
special services just for families, including play areas and programs. Be
sure to ask about these services when you call for a reservation.
If watching your wallet is a concern, look for a hotel that lets children
stay in your room for free. You may also want to consider getting a room
with a kitchenette; eating some meals in your room (or preparing and
taking food with you) can help defray food costs. In Chapter 9, look for
the Kid Friendly icons next to hotels that offer family-friendly options.
Getting around
If you and your children don’t want to tangle with public transportation
from the airport or around the city, you can always take taxis. But if your
children are patient enough, you can get almost anywhere on the bus or
subway. Make sure to review the safety tips I give in Chapter 8 and in the
Quick Concierge before hitting the road. (By the way, children under 3
feet, 8 inches tall ride New York’s subways for free.)
Finding baby-sitting services
Many hotels have baby-sitting services or can provide lists of reliable
sitters. If your hotel can’t make a recommendation, try the Baby Sitters
Guild (% 212-682-0227) or the Frances Stewart Agency (% 212-439-
9222). These sitters are licensed, insured, and bonded and take your
children on an outing.
Touring the town
To help you plan outings with your children, look for the Kid Friendly
icons throughout this book, which point out places of particular interest
to children. You’ll find this icon next to such sights as the Bronx Zoo,
Central Park Zoo, and Central Park. For more information about planning
activities for children, pick up a copy of Frommer’s New York City with
Kids (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
Time Out New York, a magazine that comes out every Wednesday, is an
excellent source for finding out about child-friendly activities and events.
Look for the “Kids” listings near the back of the magazine. There is also,
Time Out New York Kids, which helps to steer you in the right direction
for fun with your kids.
For teenagers, some neighborhoods may be more interesting than
others. Downtown neighborhoods (such as Chelsea, the East and West
Villages, SoHo, NoHo, and NoLiTa) have younger crowds, lots of alterna-
tive music stores, coffee shops, and funky clothing stores. (For more
detailed descriptions of these neighborhoods, see Chapter 8.) Fans of
MTV’s Total Request Live may want to check out the show’s Times
Square studios.

Making Age Work for You: Advice for Seniors
Mention the fact that you’re a senior citizen when you make your travel
reservations. Although all the major U.S. airlines except America West
have cancelled their senior discount and coupon book programs, many
hotels still offer discounts for seniors. In most cities, New York included,
people over the age of 60 qualify for reduced admission to theaters,
museums, and other attractions, as well as discounted fares on public
transportation.
Members of AARP (formerly known as the American Association of
Retired Persons), 601 E St. NW, Washington, D.C. 20049 (% 888-687-2277
or 202-434-2277; www.aarp.org), get discounts on hotels, airfares, and
car rentals. AARP offers members a wide range of benefits, including
AARP: The Magazine and a monthly newsletter. Anyone over 50 years of
age can join.
Many reliable agencies and organizations target the 50-plus market.
Elderhostel (% 877-426-8056; www.elderhostel.org) arranges study
programs for those aged 55 and over (and a spouse or companion of 
any age) in the United States and in more than 80 countries around the
world. ElderTreks (% 800-741-7956; www.eldertreks.com) offers
small-group tours to off-the-beaten-path or adventure-travel locations,
restricted to travelers 50 and older. 
Recommended publications offering travel resources and discounts 
for seniors include: the quarterly magazine Travel 50 & Beyond (www.

Accessing New York City: Advice 
for Travelers with Disabilities
Most disabilities shouldn’t stop anyone from traveling because more
options and resources exist than ever before. In general, New York is
progressive in its efforts to make the city accessible for the disabled.
Equal access is now mandated by law, but implementation has been
gradual and is not complete. The city makes progress every day, though;
you may want to check on the latest changes.

Travel agencies and organizations
Many travel agencies offer customized tours and itineraries for travelers
with disabilities. Among them are Flying Wheels Travel (% 507-451-
5005; www.flyingwheelstravel.com), Access-Able Travel Source
(% 303-232-2979; www.access-able.com), and Accessible Journeys
(% 800-846-4537 or 610-521-0339). Big Apple Greeter (% 212-669-2896;
TTY 212-669-8273; www.bigapplegreeter.org) offers tours for travel-
ers with disabilities free of charge. Advance reservations are necessary.
FEDCAP Rehabilitation Services, 211 W. 14th St., New York, NY 10011

and summer tours.
Organizations that offer assistance to disabled travelers include
MossRehab (www.mossresourcenet.org), the American Foundation
for the Blind (AFB; % 800-232-5463; www.afb.org), and Society for
Accessible Travel and Hospitality (SATH; % 212-447-7284; www.sath.
org). AirAmbulanceCard.com is now partnered with SATH and allows
you to preselect top-notch hospitals in case of an emergency.
For more information specifically targeted to travelers with disabilities,
the community Web site iCan (www.icanonline.net/channels/
travel/index.cfm) has destination guides and several regular columns
on accessible travel. Also check out the quarterly magazine Emerging
Horizons (www.emerginghorizons.com) and Open World Magazine,
published by SATH.
Hospital Audiences, Inc. (220 W. 42nd St., 13th Floor, New York, NY
10036 (hot line % 888-424-4685 or local 212-575-7676; TTY 212-575-7673;
www.hospitalaudiences.org), has various programs including
“Describe,” which allows theatergoers who are blind or visually impaired
to enjoy theater with audio-describers giving a summary of the action
onstage. The hot line provides accessibility information to performance
and art venues and about programs that are signed for the hearing
impaired. You also can order Access for All, the accessibility guidebook
on city cultural institutions, for $5. The New York Society for the Deaf,
817 Broadway, 7th Floor, New York, NY 10003 (% TTY 212-777-3900;
www.nysd.org), provides travel tips for the hearing impaired. Society for
Accessible Travel & Hospitality (SATH), 347 Fifth Ave., Suite 610, New
York, NY 10016 (% 212-447-7284; www.sath.org), offers a wealth of
travel resources for people with all types of disabilities and recommends
access guides, travel agents, tour operators, companion services, and
more. Annual membership costs $45 for adults and $30 for seniors and
students.
Hotels
Some older, smaller, and budget hotels have not been updated to current
access regulations. However, other hotels, including chains such as
Hilton, offer features that accommodate wheelchairs, like roll-in 
showers, lower sinks, and extra space for maneuverability. Simply ask
for one of these accessible rooms when you make your reservation.

Transportation
Taxis are required by law to take persons with disabilities, wheelchairs,
and guide dogs. For getting into the city from one of the airports, the
Gray Line Shuttle (% 800-451-0455 or 212-315-3006) has minibuses with
lifts. The vans go only to Midtown hotels, and you must make a reserva-
tion to get a ride.
All buses in Manhattan and 95 percent of New York City buses are
equipped with wheelchair lifts and special areas where the bus seats
fold up to make extra room. The buses also “kneel,” lowering their front
ends so that the first step is more accessible. Wheelchair passengers
don’t have to request these bus services in advance; just show up at the
bus stop. The driver can help put a wheelchair on the ramp and secure
the chair inside the bus.
Subway access for travelers with disabilities is still limited, but the MTA
New York City Transit keeps working at increasing accessibility. You can
certainly experience the thrill of a New York subway ride by boarding
and getting off at the accessible stations, but the bus is a much more
flexible option. The following are wheelchair-accessible stations and
lines in Manhattan:
 Brooklyn Bridge/City Hall (4/5/6)
 14th Street/Union Square (4/5/6/N/Q/R/W)
 34th Street/Herald Square (B/D/F/Q/N/R/V/W)
 42nd Street/Port Authority Bus Terminal (A/C/E)
 Grand Central/42nd Street (4/5/6)
 50th Street (southbound only, C/E)
 51st Street (6)
 Lexington/63rd Street (F)
 66th Street/Lincoln Center (1/2)
 125th Street (4/5/6)
 175th Street (A)
 Roosevelt Island (F)
Accessible stations are marked with an icon on the free subway map 
distributed in the subway. You also can get a free brochure, Accessible
Transfer Points, from MTA Customer Assistance, 370 Jay St., Room 702,
Brooklyn, NY 11201 (% 718-330-3322; TTY 718-596-8273). Braille subway
maps are available from The Lighthouse, Inc., 111 E. 59th St., New York,
NY 10022 (% 800-334-5497 or 212-821-9200), which also produces con-
certs and exhibitions by the vision impaired.

Following the Rainbow: Advice 
for Gay and Lesbian Travelers
New York ranks with San Francisco as one of the most gay-friendly cities
in the United States. Greenwich Village and Chelsea have large gay popu-
lations, and the West Village and Chelsea areas offer abundant nightlife.
Many agencies offer tours and travel itineraries specifically for gay and
lesbian travelers:
 Above and Beyond Tours (% 800-397-2681; www.abovebeyond
tours.com) is the exclusive gay and lesbian tour operator for
United Airlines.
 Now, Voyager (% 800-255-6951; www.nowvoyager.com) is a 
well-known San Francisco–based gay-owned and -operated travel
service.
 International Gay & Lesbian Travel Association (IGLTA; % 800-
448-8550 or 954-776-2626; www.iglta.org) provides information
about gay-friendly hoteliers, tour operators, and airline representa-
tives. It offers monthly newsletters and a membership directory
that’s updated once a year. Annual membership is $200, plus a $100
fee for new members.
The following are a few of the major gay organizations in New York City:
 The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Community Center,
208 W. 13th St. between Seventh and Eighth avenues (% 212-620-
7310; www.gaycenter.org) is a fabulous source of information, and
also offers literally hundreds of events and activities each month,
from readings, films, and dances to advice and medical referrals. Call
or visit the Center’s excellent Web site to get information about the
programs it sponsors. The Center also offers a list of gay-friendly
accommodations and a calendar of local cultural events.
 The Organization of Lesbian and Gay Architects and Designers
(% 212-475-7652) offers a free map of lesbian and gay historical
landmarks.
 Gay Men’s Health Crisis (GMHC), 119 W. 24th St. (% 212-807-6655;
www.gmhc.org) has an AIDS hotline, serves anyone with HIV, and
offers a wide variety of programs.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to New York City 
60

For the most up-to-date information about events and entertainment, try
any of the city’s gay-friendly publications. The weekly Time Out New
York (www.timeoutny.com) includes a comprehensive gay and lesbian
section. HX Magazine (www.hx.com), a free publication available in
restaurants, clubs, and bars, lists events around town. Gay City News
(www.gaycitynews.com) appears every other Thursday, and The New
York Blade News (www.nyblade.com), a weekly newspaper, is pub-
lished on Thursdays. GoNYC Magazine is free glossy monthly that
focuses on articles and listings of interest to the lesbian community
(www.gonycmagazine.com).
The following travel guides are available at most travel bookstores and
gay and lesbian bookstores:
 Out and About (% 800-929-2268 or 415-644-8044; www.
outandabout.com) offers guidebooks and a newsletter ($20 per
year; 10 issues) packed with solid information on the global gay
and lesbian scene.
 Spartacus International Gay Guide (Bruno Gmünder Verlag;
www.spartacusworld.com/gayguide) and Odysseus are both
good, annual English-language guidebooks focused on gay men.
 The Damron guides (www.damron.com) include annual books for
gay men and lesbians.
 Gay Travel A to Z: The World of Gay & Lesbian Travel Options
at Your Fingertips by Marianne Ferrari (Ferrari International; Box
35575, Phoenix, AZ 85069) is a very good gay and lesbian guidebook
series.
New York City also has two GLBT bookshops: the oldest gay bookstore
in the country (founded in 1967) — the Oscar Wilde Bookshop at 15
Christopher St. (% 212-255-8097; www.oscarwildebooks.com) and
Creative Visions Books & Video at 548 Hudson St. (% 800-434-7126 or
212-645-7573; www.creativevisionsbooks.com).

Chapter 7
Taking Care of the 
Remaining Details
In This Chapter
 Renting a car . . . Not!
 Playing it safe
 Staying healthy and connected
 Finding the latest security tips
O
h, how I hate those little details — the ones I always forget. But if I
had paid more attention to those details, I could have avoided all
the last-minute hassles I’ve experienced on trips. Go over the points in
this chapter so that you don’t make the same mistakes I always do when
traveling.
Renting a Car: Not in New York!
One of the first questions that comes to mind when organizing a trip is:
“Do I need to rent a car?” In New York, the answer is clear: No! You just
don’t need one; New York is a great walking city, and you can take fast
and cheap public transportation almost anywhere. Need I mention that
gas is even more expensive than back home; parking can be a nightmare;
and driving the city streets is — more often than not — a high-speed,
high-stakes game of dodge ’em that’s not for the weak of heart? (Not to
mention that you probably don’t want to spend valuable time and $185
cash at the car pound should your car get towed!)
Playing It Safe: Travel and Medical Insurance
Three kinds of travel insurance are available: trip-cancellation insurance,
medical insurance, and lost luggage insurance. The cost of travel insur-
ance varies widely, depending on the cost and length of your trip, your
age and health, and the type of trip you’re taking. You can get estimates
from various providers through InsureMyTrip.com. Enter your trip cost

and dates, your age, and other information, for prices from more than a
dozen companies. Here is my advice on all three types of travel insurance.
 Trip-cancellation insurance helps you get your money back if you
have to back out of a trip, if you have to go home early, or if your
travel supplier goes bankrupt. Allowed reasons for cancellation can
range from sickness to natural disasters to the State Department
declaring your destination unsafe for travel.
A good resource is “Travel Guard Alerts,” a list of companies 
considered high-risk by Travel Guard International (www.
travelinsured.com). Protect yourself further by paying for the
insurance with a credit card — by law, consumers can get their
money back on goods and services not received if they report the
loss within 60 days after the charge is listed on their credit card
statement. 
Many tour operators, particularly those offering trips to remote or
high-risk areas, include trip-cancellation insurance in the cost of
the trip or can arrange insurance policies through a partnering
provider. This option is a convenient and often cost-effective way
for you to obtain insurance, but make sure the tour company is a
reputable one. Some experts suggest you avoid buying insurance
from the tour or cruise company you’re traveling with, saying it’s
better to buy from a third party insurer than to put all your money
in one place.
 Medical insurance coverage doesn’t make sense for most people
travelling domestically. Most existing health policies cover you if
you get sick away from home — but check before you go, particu-
larly if you’re insured by an HMO.
 Lost luggage insurance is not necessary for most travelers. On
domestic flights, checked baggage is covered up to $2,500 per tick-
eted passenger. On international flights (including U.S. portions of
international trips), baggage coverage is limited to approximately
$9.07 per pound, up to approximately $635 per checked bag. If you
plan to check items more valuable than the standard liability, see if
your valuables are covered by your homeowner’s policy, get bag-
gage insurance as part of your comprehensive travel-insurance
package, or buy Travel Guard’s “BagTrak” product. Don’t buy insur-
ance at the airport, as it’s usually overpriced. Be sure to take any
valuables or irreplaceable items with you in your carry-on luggage,
as many valuables (including books, money and electronics) aren’t
covered by airline policies. 
If your luggage is lost, immediately file a lost-luggage claim at the
airport, detailing the luggage contents. For most airlines, you must
report delayed, damaged, or lost baggage within 4 hours of arrival.
The airlines are required to deliver luggage, once found, directly to
your house or destination free of charge.

com); Travel Insured International (% 800-243-3174; www.travel
insured.com); and Travelex Insurance Services (% 888-457-4602;
www.travelex-insurance.com).
Staying Healthy When You Travel
Getting sick ruins your vacation, so I strongly advise against it (of course,
last time I checked, the bugs weren’t listening to me any more than they
probably listen to you). New York won’t make you sick more than any
other city, and the water is safe to drink. Beyond that, take this basic
advice for keeping your health in tiptop shape.
For domestic trips, most reliable healthcare plans provide coverage if
you get sick away from home.
Before leaving on your trip, talk to your doctor if you have a serious
and/or chronic illness; she may make some recommendations for keep-
ing yourself healthy and comfortable while you travel. For conditions
such as epilepsy, diabetes, or heart problems, register with MedicAlert
(% 888-633-4298; www.medicalert.org) and wear your identification
tag, which alerts doctors to your condition and gives them access to
your records through MedicAlert’s 24-hour hotline. The United States
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (% 800-311-3435; www.
cdc.gov) provides up-to-date information on health hazards by region
and offers tips on food safety.
Staying Connected by Cellphone or E-mail
Staying in touch with the folks at home (or with each other) is much
easier these days thanks to the rapidly expanding cellphone networks
and various plans that give you plenty of unlimited minutes. Access to
the Internet from your phone or at hotel or public terminals (or from
your own laptop, via Wi-Fi, or via a handy modem cord and plug) also
makes communicating while traveling much less complicated.
Using a cellphone across the U.S.
Just because your cellphone works at home doesn’t mean it’ll work else-
where in the country (thanks to our nation’s fragmented cellphone
system). It’s a good bet that your phone will work in major cities. But
take a look at your wireless company’s coverage map on its website
before heading out — T-Mobile, Sprint, and Nextel are particularly weak
in rural areas. If you need to stay in touch at a destination where you
know your phone won’t work, rent a phone from InTouch USA (% 800-
872-7626; www.intouchglobal.com) or a rental car location, but beware
that you’ll pay $1 a minute or more for airtime.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to New York City 
64

If you’re not from the U.S., you’ll be appalled at the poor reach of our
GSM (Global System for Mobiles) wireless network, which is used by
much of the rest of the world. Your phone will probably work in most
major U.S. cities; it definitely won’t work in many rural areas. (To see
where GSM phones work in the U.S., check out www.t-mobile.com/
coverage/national_popup.asp) And you may or may not be able to
send SMS (text messaging) home.
Accessing the Internet away from home
Travelers have any number of ways to check their e-mail and access the
Internet on the road. Of course, using your own laptop — or even a
phone, PDA (personal digital assistant), or electronic organizer with a
modem — gives you the most flexibility. But even if you don’t have a
computer, you can still access your e-mail and even your office com-
puter from cybercafes.
Taking advantage of cybercafes
Although no definitive directory for cybercafes exists — these are inde-
pendent businesses, after all — two places to start looking are www.
cybercaptive.com and www.cybercafe.com.
Some of the places where you can check your e-mail in New York
include:
 The Times Square Visitors Center: 1560 Broadway, between 46th
and 47th streets (% 212-768-1560; open daily 8 a.m.–8 p.m.)
 easyInternetcafé: 235 W. 42nd St., between Seventh and Eighth
avenues (% 212-398-0775; www.easyeverything.com; open 
24 hours)
 CyberCafe: in Times Square at 250 W. 49th St., between Broadway
and Eighth Avenue (% 212-333-4109; www.cyber-cafe.com), and
in SoHo at 273 Lafayette St., at Prince Street (% 212-334-5140)
 Kinko’s: numerous locations, including 100 Wall St., at Water Street
(% 212-269-0024); near City Hall at 105 Duane St., between Broadway
and Church Street (% 212-406-1220); 245 Seventh Ave., at 24th St.
(% 212-929-2679); 60 W. 40th St., between Fifth and Sixth avenues
(% 212-921-1060); and 221 W. 72nd St., at Broadway (% 212-362-5288)
Finding other ways to surf the Web
Aside from formal cybercafes, most youth hostels have at least one com-
puter you can use to access the Internet. And most public libraries offer
Internet access free or for a small fee. Avoid hotel business centers
unless you’re willing to pay exorbitant rates. (More hotels are offering
free Internet access in their business centers, but it’s not something they
all do.)
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 65

Most major airports now have Internet kiosks scattered throughout
their gates. These kiosks, which you may also see in shopping malls,
hotel lobbies, and tourist information offices, give you basic Internet
access for a per-minute fee that’s usually higher than cybercafe prices.
The kiosks’ clunkiness and high prices mean they should be avoided
whenever possible.
To retrieve your e-mail, ask your Internet Service Provider (ISP) if it has
a Web-based interface tied to your existing e-mail account. If your ISP
doesn’t have such an interface, you can use the free mail2web service
(www.mail2web.com) to view and reply to your home e-mail. If you 
need to access files on your office computer, look into a service called
GoToMyPC (www.gotomypc.com). The service provides a Web-based
interface for you to access and manipulate a distant PC from anywhere —
even a cybercafe — provided your “target” PC is on and has an always-on
connection to the Internet (such as with Road Runner cable).
With your own computer
More and more hotels, cafes, and retailers are signing on as wireless
fidelity (Wi-Fi) “hotspots” from where you can get high-speed connection
without cable wires, networking hardware, or a phone line. Mac owners
have their own networking technology, Apple AirPort. T-Mobile Hotspot
(www.t-mobile.com/hotspot) serves up wireless connections at more
than 1,000 Starbucks coffee shops nationwide. Boingo (www.boingo.com)
and Wayport (www.wayport.com) have set up networks in airports and
high-class hotel lobbies. IPass providers (see below) also give you access
to a few hundred wireless hotel lobby setups. To locate other hotspots
that provide free wireless networks in cities around the world, go to
www.personaltelco.net/index.cgi/WirelessCommunities.
If Wi-Fi is not available at your destination, most business-class hotels
throughout the world offer dataports for laptop modems, and a few
thousand hotels in the U.S. and Europe now offer free high-speed
Internet access. In addition, major Internet Service Providers (ISP) have
local access numbers around the world, allowing you to go online by
simply placing a local call. The iPass network has dial-up numbers in
most of the world’s countries. You’ll have to sign up with an iPass
provider, who will then tell you how to set up your computer for your
destination(s). For a list of iPass providers, go to www.ipass.com and
click on “Individuals Buy Now.” One solid provider is i2roam (www.
i2roam.com; % 866-811-6209 or 920-235-0475). 
Wherever you go, bring a connection kit of the right power and phone
adapters, a spare phone cord, and a spare Ethernet network cable — or
find out whether your hotel supplies them to guests.

66

Keeping Up with Airline Security Measures
With the federalization of airport security, procedures at U.S. airports
are more stable and consistent than ever. Generally, you won’t be
delayed if you arrive at the airport one hour before a domestic flight; if
you show up late, tell an airline employee so that he or she can (hope-
fully) whisk you away to the front of the line.
Don’t leave home without a current, government-issued photo ID, such
as a driver’s license or passport. Keep your ID at the ready to show at
check-in, at the security checkpoint, and sometimes even at the gate.
(Children under 18 don’t need government-issued photo IDs for domes-
tic flights, but they do for international flights to most countries.)
In 2003, the TSA phased out gate check-in at all U.S. airports. And 
E-tickets have made paper tickets nearly obsolete. Passengers with 
E-tickets can beat the ticket-counter lines by using airport electronic
kiosks or even online check-in from your home computer. Online check-
in involves logging on to your airlines’ website, accessing your reserva-
tion, and printing out your boarding pass — and the airline may even
offer you bonus miles to do so! If you’re using a kiosk at the airport,
bring the credit card you used to book the ticket or your frequent-flier
card. Print out your boarding pass from the kiosk and simply proceed to
the security checkpoint with your pass and a photo ID. Curbside check-
in is also a good way to avoid lines, although a few airlines still ban
curbside check-in; call before you go.
Speed up security by not wearing metal objects such as big belt 
buckles. If you’ve got metallic body parts, a note from your doctor can
prevent a long chat with the security screeners. Keep in mind that only
ticketed passengers are allowed past security, except for folks escorting
disabled passengers or children.
Federalization has stabilized what you can carry on and what you
can’t. Travelers in the U.S. are allowed one carry-on bag, plus a “per-
sonal item” such as a purse, briefcase, or laptop bag. Carry-on hoarders
can stuff all sorts of things into a laptop bag; as long as it has a laptop 
in it, it’s still considered a personal item. The Transportation Security
Administration (TSA) has issued a list of restricted items; check its web-
site (www.tsa.gov/public/index.jsp) for details. 
Airport screeners may decide that your checked luggage needs to be
searched by hand. You can now purchase luggage locks that allow
screeners to open and re-lock a checked bag if hand-searching is neces-
sary. Look for Travel Sentry certified locks at luggage or travel shops and
Brookstone stores (you can buy them online at www.brookstone.com).
For more information on the locks, visit www.travelsentry.org.

W
hether you’re landing at one of the three major area airports,
alighting from Amtrak, or taking the family car to New York City,
this chapter helps you get to where you’re going.
Getting from the Airport to Your Hotel
The New York airports, like airports in most cities, are located away from
the center of things — LaGuardia and Kennedy are in the borough of
Queens, and Newark Airport is across the Hudson River in New Jersey.
From any of these airports, taking a taxi is the easiest and most hassle-
free option, but it’s also the most expensive. Another possibility is to use
a car service or van service (see the following sections for information).
At the cheaper end, you can take a bus or a train.
If you take a cab, make sure that a uniformed, official taxi dispatcher
hails your cab. Always stand in the official taxi line and take a licensed
New Jersey taxi or New York City yellow cab. If someone approaches you
offering a cab ride, just keep walking toward the cab line; illegal drivers,
who may take you on an unwelcome ride, abound at all three main air-
ports. Remember that taxis are required by law to take no more than
four people, and you should always tip 15 percent of the fare, regardless
of whether the driver helps you with your bags.

Part III: Settling Into New York City 

From JFK
John F. Kennedy International (JFK) is New York’s largest airport. Its sev-
eral terminals are located along a great loop. Each terminal has a taxi
stand, bus stops, and car service pickup points. After collecting your
luggage, follow the “Ground Transportation” signs or the signs for the
closest exit to the transportation of your choice.
A cab from JFK to Manhattan takes about 45 minutes, depending on the
traffic (which can be fierce), and costs a flat rate of $45 plus tolls and tip.
The toll is $4.50 each for the Queens Midtown Tunnel and the Triborough
Bridge; the Queensborough Bridge is free, as are the Williamsburg and
Manhattan bridges, but they can get very crowded. Still, if your destina-
tion is downtown and the Williamsburg and Manhattan bridges are free of
construction, they should be your best bets to get into the city quickly.
Your cab driver should know the fastest way into town considering the
traffic situation. If you arrive at night (8 p.m.–6 a.m.), you have to pay a
50¢ night surcharge and a $1 surcharge Monday through Friday from 
4 to 6 p.m.
A private car service (a “limo” in New York-ese) is another option. In
fact, a ride in a private car can cost a little less than a cab ride. Also, the
driver meets you just outside the baggage claim area, so you don’t have
to wait in line for a cab. Following are some of the car companies that
service JFK; call ahead for a reservation:
 Allstate: % 800-453-4099 or 212-333-3333
 Carmel: % 800-922-7635 or 212-666-6666
 Dial 7: % 800-777-8888 or 212-777-7777
Another possibility is to take a shared transportation service (a “mini-
van” in New York lingo). Follow the “Ground Transportation” signs upon
your arrival and sign up at one of the desks. Options include:
 New York Airport Service (% 800-872-4577, 718-875-8200, or
212-875-8200; www.nyairportservice.com) offers regular bus
service to and from Manhattan. The buses stop outside each termi-
nal at JFK; follow the directions to ground transportation and wait
by the sign. When boarding the bus at the airport, purchase your
ticket on the bus or from the dispatcher at the sign. Buses leave
every 20 minutes. The bus makes three stops in Manhattan: across
from Grand Central Terminal (the southeast corner of 42nd Street
and Park Avenue), the Port Authority Bus Terminal (42nd Street and
Eighth Avenue), and Penn Station (1 Penn Plaza between 31st and
33rd streets, just off Seventh Avenue). The price is $15 one-way or
$27 round-trip; children under 12 ride free, but watch out for the
limit of one free child per full-fare adult. You can take advantage of a
$1 discount for tickets purchased on the Web site; discounted rates
are available for students and seniors, but only if tickets are pur-
chased from the ticket counters in Manhattan. Add $2 for the
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 73

Midtown Hotel Shuttle, which serves hotels between 33rd and 57th
streets. When you leave New York, you can take the bus service
from any of these three stops, but you need to call 24 hours in
advance to reserve a hotel pickup.
 Super-Shuttle (% 800-BLUE-VAN or 212-BLUE-VAN; www.super
shuttle.com) has vans on call 24 hours a day to all destinations in
Manhattan. The price is $13 to or from the airport if you’re staying
at a hotel; if you’re staying at a residential address, the price is $15
from the airport and $22 to the airport for the first passenger in
your party and $9 for each additional passenger; children under 3
ride free. You can reserve in advance for your pickup to head back
to the airport.
Last and least is public transportation. Going from JFK to Manhattan by
public transportation is really cheap but really time-consuming. This
option is best reserved for those traveling light and with more time than
money. A few bumpy years after opening in 2003, AirTrain JFK is begin-
ning to operate more efficiently. And you can’t beat the price — only $7
if you take a subway to the AirTrain, $12 if you take Long Island Rail
Road. From Midtown Manhattan, the ride can take anywhere from 40
minutes to an hour, depending on your connections. Subway lines that
connect with the AirTrain are the A, E, J, and Z; the E, J, Z to Jamaica
Station and Sutphin Blvd.–Archer Ave. Station, and the A to Howard
Beach/JFK Airport Station. The MTA is contemplating adding connec-
tions to the AirTrain in Lower Manhattan sometime in the next decade,
but there’s not much they can do now to speed up the trip.
From LaGuardia
Smaller than JFK, LaGuardia receives fewer flights than its two New
York–area counterparts — but, paradoxically, it experiences more flight
delays, according to the FAA. Just step outside the terminal at the 
baggage-claim level for ground transportation.
The fare for a taxi ride from LaGuardia to Midtown runs about $20 to $30
plus tolls and tip. The toll is $4.50 each for the Queens Midtown Tunnel
and Triborough Bridge; the Queensborough Bridge is free, as are the
Williamsburg and Manhattan bridges. Allow 30 minutes or more for this
trip, depending on traffic.
A private car service is also an option (see “From JFK,” earlier in 
this chapter). Call ahead to one of these reliable car companies for a
reservation:
 Allstate: % 800-453-4099 or 212-333-3333
 Carmel: % 800-922-7635 or 212-666-6666
 Dial 7: % 800-222-9888 or 212-777-7777
Part III: Settling Into New York City 
74

New York Airport Service (% 800-872-4577, 718-706-9658, or 718-875-
8200; www.nyairportservice.com) also serves LaGuardia. It offers the
same service to and from LaGuardia as for JFK (see “From JFK,” earlier in
this chapter). Buses leave every 20 minutes, and the cost is $12 one-way
or $21 round-trip (children under 12 free, $1 Internet discount, discounted
rates for students and seniors available only from the service’s ticket
counters in Manhattan). Add $2 for the Midtown Hotel Shuttle service.
Shared transportation services are a good option from LaGuardia as
well. Follow the “Ground Transportation” signs upon your arrival and
sign up at one of the desks.
Super-Shuttle (% 800-BLUE-VAN or 212-BLUE-VAN; www.supershuttle.
com) has vans on call 24 hours a day to all destinations in Manhattan. The
price is $13 to and from the airport if you’re going to a hotel; if you’re
staying at a private residence, the price is $15 from the airport and $22
to the airport for the first passenger in your party and $9 for each addi-
tional passenger. Children under 3 ride free. You can reserve in advance
for pickup to go back to the airport.
As for public transportation, the M60 bus gets you from the airport to a
choice of subway stops: first the Astoria Boulevard stop in Queens on the
N or W line, then into Manhattan at one of the subway stops on 125th
Street (2 or 3; 4, 5, or 6; or A, B, C, or D subway lines), and finally to the
Cathedral Parkway/110th Street stop and the 116th Street/Columbia
University stop on the 1 subway line. Another possibility: The Q48 and
Q33 buses bring you to a stop of the 7 train in Queens, which eventually
takes you to Times Square. Curbside bus signs and stops are clearly
marked. If you’re using the bus-and-subway system’s MetroCard, you’re
allowed free transfers to approved connecting buses and subways within
two hours of initial card use. In both cases, you face a complicated, two-
hour odyssey that you shouldn’t attempt unless you’re really looking to
save money.
From Newark
Although it’s in New Jersey, Newark is closer to Manhattan than JFK,
especially if your final destination is downtown or the West Side of
Manhattan. The Air Train to Newark airport has been a revelation, con-
necting Newark’s three terminals with the long-term parking lots and
with the Rail Link (the railroad station of Newark Airport). From there,
you can catch a train directly into New York Penn Station ($12). See the
end of this section for details.
The airport taxi dispatcher sets the price of a cab — about $34 to $45 —
from Newark to Manhattan based on your destination, to which you add
toll and tip. You pay a $6 inbound-only toll (toward Manhattan) for
either the Holland Tunnel or the Lincoln Tunnel, and you should tip 15
percent. You will most likely take a New Jersey cab on the way in and a
New York cab on the way back to the airport. The trip takes about 40
minutes each way, assuming traffic is moving.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 75

You can take a private bus as well. Olympia Airport Express (% 212-
964-6233; www.olympiabus.com) offers regular service between Newark
and destinations in Manhattan for $13 each way or $26 round-trip (chil-
dren under 30 inches tall ride free, seniors and travelers with disabilities
pay $6 — but only if you buy your ticket at the ticket counters). Buses
run every 20 minutes, and the ride takes 30 minutes or longer, depend-
ing on traffic. From the Grand Central Station stop (at 120 E. 41st St.
between Park and Lexington avenues), you can transfer to Olympia
Trails’ Midtown Shuttle, which takes you to any destination between
30th and 65th streets for an additional $5 (you can purchase the ticket 
at the airport). Other stops in Manhattan are Penn Station (at the north-
west corner of 34th Street and Eighth Avenue) and the Port Authority
Bus Terminal (gates 316 and 317 at the Airport Bus Center, on 42nd
Street between Eighth and Ninth avenues).
In the airport, follow the “Ground Transportation” signs and stop at the
Olympia Airport Express counter, or go directly to the bus stop outside
that corresponds to your destination; you can buy your ticket at the
counter or from the driver. If you’re traveling from Manhattan, you can
find a dispatcher on duty at the bus stop at 34th Street and 8th Avenue
and a counter in the Airport Bus Center; at the 41st Street stop, you can
buy your ticket from the Western Union office or from the driver.
Another possibility is to take a minivan. Follow the signs for ground
transportation upon your arrival and sign up at one of the desks:
 Super-Shuttle (% 800-BLUE-VAN or 212-BLUE-VAN; www.super
shuttle.com) has vans on call 24 hours a day to all destinations in
Manhattan. The price is $13 to or from the airport if you’re going to a
hotel; if you’re staying at a private residence, the price is $15 from
the airport and $22 to the airport for the first passenger in your
party and $9 for any additional passengers; children under 3 ride
free. You can reserve in advance for pickup to go back to the airport.
 Newark Airport Express (% 877-8-NEWARK or 877-863-9275;
www.graylinenewyork.com) has vans every 20 minutes serving
hotels between 23rd and 63rd streets. The fare is $16 to and $21
from Newark Airport; children under 6 ride free; round-trip is $28.
You also can take public transportation:
 To get to the AirTrain (% 800-772-2222 or 973-762-5100; www.air
trainnewark.com) from your terminal, take the airport monorail
(monorail stations are located in each terminal) to the Rail Link 
station served by Amtrak and New Jersey Transit, where you can
catch a direct train to New York Penn Station (a 20-minute ride).
Trains run every 20 minutes on weekdays and every half-hour on
weekends; service is less frequent in the evening after 9 p.m. A one-
way trip on New Jersey Transit is $12 for adults and $9.05 for chil-
dren and seniors. Purchase tickets from the automated vending
Part III: Settling Into New York City 
76

machines in the station; if you purchase a ticket from the conduc-
tor on the train, add $5 to the price.
 An even cheaper option is to catch a New Jersey Transit train to
Newark Penn Station (a five-minute ride; $6.80 adults and $5.80 
children and seniors), where you can hop a PATH train to
Manhattan. The PATH train works quite well and costs only $1.50.
From Newark, the train makes four stops in New Jersey and five
stops in Manhattan, which are Christopher Street (in Greenwich
Village on Hudson Street), 9th Street, 14th Street, 23rd Street, and
33rd Street, all along Sixth Avenue. Allow about 40 minutes for the
trip between Newark Penn Station and 33rd Street.
Note that the PATH train to Manhattan is very crowded with com-
muters during morning rush hour and from Manhattan during the
evening rush hour. If you’re toting luggage, paying the extra $3 to
take the train from the airport directly to New York Penn Station is
far easier.
From MacArthur Airport (Long Island)
Although I don’t recommend flying into MacArthur Airport in Islip, Long
Island, 50 miles east of Manhattan, the budget airline Southwest flies
there. So if you get a rock-bottom fare on Southwest, you may decide it’s
worth it to fly into MacArthur. Be aware that taxi service into the city is
not available from there, but you can reserve a private car (a limo, as we
say in New York), which costs about $125 for a 11⁄2-hour trip. Call Colonial
Transportation (% 631-589-3500; www.colonialtransportation.com)
for reservations.
Another option is to take the shuttle, also run by Colonial Transportation
(a white van marked “Express Service”) from outside the terminal to the
Ronkonkoma train station. From there you can take the Long Island Rail
Road (% 718-217-5477) into New York Penn Station. A shuttle comes
every 20 minutes and costs $5; the train ride costs about $10, depending
on the time of day. The trip takes about 1 hour and 45 minutes.
Finally, you can use the Hampton Jitney (% 631-283-4600; www.
hamptonjitney.com). Take a local cab to the Jitney’s bus stop in
Ronkonkoma for about $15, and then catch the bus (a 11⁄2-hour ride) 
into Manhattan for $27.
Arriving by Train
As I mention in Chapter 5, Amtrak offers regular service to New York from
many cities in the United States. Amtrak trains arrive at Penn Station
(between Seventh and Eighth avenues and 31st and 33rd streets), a large,
noisy space with fast-food outlets galore and cramped waiting areas.
From the station, you can take a cab to wherever you’re headed; signs
guide you to the taxi stand on Penn Plaza Drive, a passageway situated
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 77

between Penn Station (close to Eighth Avenue) and the Long Island Rail
Road Terminal (LIRR, close to Seventh Avenue).
Another option is public transportation; the station is well connected
with the 1, 2, 3, A, C, or E trains and several buses. However, this isn’t
the best alternative, especially if you’re unfamiliar with the city and you
have a lot of luggage. Elevators are virtually unheard of in New York’s
subway stations, so count on lugging your bags up and down multiple
flights of stairs.
Arriving by Car
I don’t recommend having a car in New York for the reasons I outline in
Chapter 7. If you decide to arrive by car, you’ll immediately understand
why I tried to dissuade you.
You know you’re approaching New York when the traffic and signs multi-
ply beyond all expectations. Open your eyes and sharpen your senses; if
you’re unfamiliar with the tangle of highways, thoroughfares, and park-
ways, then getting into Manhattan can be a nerve-racking experience.
Remember that you won’t find signs for Manhattan; signs give the names
of specific tunnels, bridges, and streets instead.
If you arrive from the west or south, the New Jersey Turnpike is your
jumping-off point to Manhattan. Take exit 14C for the Holland Tunnel
(which lets you out around Canal Street in Manhattan), exit 16E for the
Lincoln Tunnel (which deposits you in far-west Midtown at 42nd Street),
or exit 18, the turnpike’s end, for the George Washington Bridge (which
lets you out at 181st Street, far uptown). The inbound-only toll (toward
Manhattan) is $6; you pay no outbound toll (you’re free to leave, so to
speak).
From the north, take the Deegan Expressway (I-87); from the northeast,
take the New England Thruway (I-95) to the Bruckner Expressway. To
get to the east side of Manhattan, follow the signs to the Triborough
Bridge ($4.50 toll in both directions), but then be careful to follow the
signs to FDR Drive and avoid going on to Queens — unless that’s your
destination. FDR Drive runs along the East River all the way to the south-
ern tip of Manhattan and has exits at different points. If you want to get
to the west side of Manhattan, exit I-87 at the Sawmill River Parkway and
follow it to the Henry Hudson Parkway, pass the Henry Hudson Bridge (a
$2.25 toll), and you can find yourself on the West Side Highway, which
runs along the Hudson on the west side of the island to its southern tip
and has exits at different streets.
When approaching a toll plaza, stay in the lanes marked “Cash” and not
“EZ-Pass,” (unless, of course, you have an EZ-Pass). EZ-Pass is a toll pay-
ment system where a scanner identifies your car by an electronic tag
mounted on your windshield and deducts the toll from a prepaid
Part III: Settling Into New York City 
78

account. No attendants man the EZ-Pass booths, so you can’t pay cash
in those lanes.
If you’re coming from the Northeast, many of the contiguous states have
an EZ-Pass program, and your tag from the other states also works in
New York City.
The Cross Bronx Expressway runs east-west and connects to the George
Washington Bridge; you can use it to get to whichever side of the island
you want, but its traffic jams are infamous (especially on days when the
Yankees play at home).
After you’re on the West Side Highway or FDR Drive, take the exit closest
to your destination — all exits have street names — and calm down:
You’ve made it to New York!
Figuring Out the Neighborhoods
Getting to know New York and all its neighborhoods is easy (see the
“Manhattan Neighborhoods” map on p. 80). Most of the city’s famous
sights are on the island of Manhattan, bounded by the Hudson River to
the west and the East River — guess where? — to the east. With the
exception of a few of the downtown streets, the main avenues run north-
south and the streets run east-west.
Downtown
“Downtown” is both a place and a state of mind; physically, everything
below 14th Street is considered downtown. Chelsea, the Flatiron District,
and Gramercy Park are not, strictly speaking, downtown, but I’ve included
them in this section because they’re in that nebulous zone that’s neither
downtown nor Midtown.
Lower Manhattan and the Financial District
Lower Manhattan is where the city was born and as a result, the area 
is home to some of the most important historic landmarks, including
Trinity Church, South Street Seaport, and the Brooklyn Bridge.
Much of the area is considered the Financial District but may be even
more famous now as Ground Zero. Until September 11, 2001, the
Financial District was anchored by the World Trade Center, with the
World Financial Center complex and Battery Park City to the west, and
Wall Street running crosstown a little south and to the east. Now, a
gaping hole sits where the Twin Towers and five other buildings stood.
Ground Zero has been cleaned, and a beautiful, though temporary, PATH
station has reopened. Designs for what will eventually be constructed 
on the site have finally been approved, but it will be years before those
designs are fully realized. For more information about visiting the World
Trade Center site, see Chapter 11.

City Hall remains the northern border of the district, abutting Chambers
Street. Most of the streets of this neighborhood are narrow concrete
canyons, with Broadway serving as the main uptown-downtown artery.
Just about all the major subway lines congregate here before they either
end or head to Brooklyn.
Since September 11, 2001, Lower Manhattan has revitalized itself and
now has so much to offer. The local community has united to promote
the area. Check out these Web sites for useful information on new devel-
opments and exciting events that you can find downtown. Both www.
lowermanhattan.info and www.downtownny.com, the Web site for the
Alliance for Downtown New York, Inc., are updated daily.
TriBeCa, Chinatown, Little Italy, and the Lower East Side
TriBeCa, the acronym for the Triangle Below Canal (Street), is one of the
city’s hippest neighborhoods. It’s an area of residential lofts inhabited by
artists and celebrities, as well as the home of some of the most fashion-
able and chic restaurants in town. Hip doesn’t translate into big crowds,
though; the neighborhood, especially at night, is very quiet. Canal Street
runs straight across the island, going through the heart of Chinatown,
which lies to the east of TriBeCa. Chinatown is a sprawling neighbor-
hood that bursts with shops selling Asian wares, cheap souvenirs, boot-
leg DVDs and CDs, and counterfeit watches, bags, and sunglasses (more
about these offerings in Chapter 12). The streets are lined with Asian
restaurants of every variety, and the sometimes very ripe aroma of fish
from the countless fish stalls fills the air.
North of Chinatown and centered around Mott and Mulberry streets is
Little Italy. The neighborhood, squeezed by the northern encroachment
of Chinatown, has sadly been reduced to not much more than a tourist
trap, with just a few remaining cafes, stores, and mediocre restaurants.
To the east and north of Little Italy is the Lower East Side, a historic
area that was a Jewish ghetto in the 19th century. The neighborhood is
now a bubbling mix of hipster-trendy (alternative music clubs, adventur-
ous new restaurants) and old-world remnants from its historic past. The
farther east you go, the sketchier the neighborhood can get.
Orchard Street is where you can find great bargain hunting in many old-
world fabric and clothing stores that thrive between club-clothes bou-
tiques and trendy lounges. Keep in mind that the old-world shops close
early on Friday afternoon and remain closed all day on Saturday (the
Jewish Sabbath). The exponentially expanding hipster set can be found
in the blocks between Allen and Clinton streets south of Houston and
north of Delancey, with more new shops, bars, and restaurants popping
up in the blocks to the east every day. The Lower East Side Business
Improvement District operates a neighborhood visitor center at 261
Broome St., between Orchard and Allen streets (% 866-224-0206 or
212-226-9010), that’s open daily from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. (sometimes later).
Stop in for an Orchard Street Bargain District shopping guide (which
they can also send you in advance), plus other information on this 
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 81

historic yet freshly hip ’hood. You can also find shopping, dining, and
nightlife directories online at www.lowereastsideny.com.
Greenwich Village, the East Village, SoHo, and NoHo
SoHo (which stands for south of Houston Street — pronounced “how-
ston,” not “hyoo-ston”) is famous for its cast-iron architecture and, in the
past 25 years, its thriving art scene. The art scene, however, is not as
thriving as it was just a decade ago, with just a few galleries remaining;
artists can no longer afford the astronomical rents. Still, SoHo’s cachet
has been established and you can find numerous chic boutiques and
some interesting restaurants here as well. The eastern part of SoHo,
rebaptized NoLiTa (north of Little Italy), is where young, innovative
fashion and accessory designers have opened small shops. The neigh-
borhood has merged north into NoHo (north of Houston), a small, fash-
ionable area just east of Broadway and north of Houston Street. You can
find some of the city’s most trend-setting restaurants here.
Greenwich Village, also called simply “the Village,” is a center of art,
dining, shopping, music, and gay life. The neighborhood is roughly bor-
dered by Houston Street to the south and 14th Street to the north.
Known for its architecture, the Village has the shortest street in the city
(Weehawken, just one block long) and the narrowest house (on Bedford
Street, where poet Edna St. Vincent Millay once lived). It’s an area that
never sleeps, yet it still manages to give off a sense of quiet and beauty.
Within the Village itself is the West Village, west of Seventh Avenue,
which is the historic center of New York’s gay community and is cen-
tered around Sheridan Square and Christopher Street. It has a residential
feel, with beautiful tree-lined streets and comfortable neighborhood
cafes. East of Broadway, the Village becomes the East Village, a center
for alternative music and dance clubs, which draws a younger, edgier
crowd. More raw and less polished, and despite rising rents, the East
Village still clings proudly to its seediness. Despite that, some excellent
restaurants and a growing number of boutiques can be found in the East
Village. The area between the East Village and West Village (that is,
between Broadway and Seventh Avenues) is simply referred to as the
Village. In the middle sit New York University and Washington Square
Park, landmarked by the park’s famous arch.
Chelsea, the Flatiron District, and Gramercy Park
Chelsea, which extends from 14th Street to 26th Street and from the
Hudson River to Fifth Avenue, is now the city’s largest gay community.
The neighborhood lays claim to lots of art galleries and many cutting-
edge cafes, restaurants, and a congregation of high-end, velvet rope–
guarded nightclubs. East of Chelsea is the Gramercy Park area — a
quiet, elegant, moneyed neighborhood known for its jewel of a park and
handsome architecture. In between are Union Square and the Flatiron
District, a lively hub of New York life that was home to New York’s
dot.com companies in the late 1990s, before the virtual economy went
bust. This area, bordered by the historic Flatiron Building to the north
Part III: Settling Into New York City 
82

(at Broadway and Fifth at 23rd Street) and Union Square to the south, is
where members of the fashion industry — models, advertising people,
photographers, and so on — meet and eat.
Midtown
Midtown is roughly defined by 26th Street to the south and 59th Street
to the north. This is concrete canyon territory, where skyscrapers block
out most of the sun and sky. During the day, Midtown is a hectic center
of commerce, seething with people on their way to or from work, while
at night, the restaurant scene is lively and generally very expensive. This
is the city’s biggest hotel neighborhood, with choices running the gamut
from cheap to chic.
Within Midtown to the southeast lies Murray Hill, just east of Fifth
Avenue and below 42nd Street. It’s a mixture of business and residential
property, where a 40-story slab may rub up against a 5-story apartment
building. The Murray Hill area is safe and quiet — for New York. The
Empire State Building is the major sightseeing stop here. Above 42nd
Street is Midtown East, which is more commercial and includes a
number of famous shops that line 59th Street between Fifth and
Lexington. The main attractions in this area are the United Nations,
Grand Central Terminal, St. Patrick’s Cathedral, Rockefeller Center, and
the stunning Chrysler Building. The stretch of Fifth Avenue from Saks 
at 49th Street extending to the Plaza Hotel at 59th is home to the city’s
most high-profile, haute shopping, including Tiffany & Co. and Bergdorf
Goodman. Here you can find the city’s finest collection of grand hotels,
mostly along Lexington Avenue and near the park at the top of Fifth.
To the southwest lies the Fashion or Garment District (roughly between
26th and 42nd streets west of Fifth Avenue), with its array of fabric shops
and wholesale fashion stores. At the heart of it, at the intersection of 
34th Street, Broadway, and Sixth Avenue (also called the Avenue of the
Americas), is Herald Square, a bustling (some would say choked-with-
crowds) shopping area. Herald Square is the home of Macy’s, and with
ongoing development, more national chain stores are appearing all the
time. Other than that, it’s a pretty grim commercial area that lacks any
real charisma.
Farther north, on the west side, is Times Square, a once legendary place
full of peep shows and sex shops until a business partnership completed
an ambitious (and completely transforming) improvement campaign.
Times Square is now a family-oriented area with renovated theaters and
the famous neon, which is bigger, brighter, and louder than ever (includ-
ing the largest TV screen in the world, the Sony Jumbotron). Crowds are
sometimes impenetrable, so be prepared for a major jostling. Just up
Broadway is the Theater District. The area churns with activity, and the
scale is grand, so it’s not the kind of place to step out for a casual stroll
under the trees (there aren’t any, anyway). Famed Restaurant Row is
close by on 46th Street. A number of hotels are centered around Times
Square, so if you don’t mind the crowds, generally higher prices, and
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 83

want to be as close as possible to the pulse of the city, this is where you
want to be.
Just west of the Theater District is Hell’s Kitchen, probably the most
picturesquely named neighborhood in New York City. Once a rough-and-
tumble immigrant community and the home turf of Irish gangs, Hell’s
Kitchen has seen some gentrification. In an amusing example of New
York’s constant effort to reinvent itself, real-estate developers have
pushed to rename the area “Clinton Hill” or “Theater District West,” but
thankfully, the natives have resisted those monikers. Ninth Avenue has
blossomed into one of the city’s finest dining avenues; just stroll along
and choose from a world of great, inexpensive dining options, from
American diner to Mediterranean to traditional Thai.
Uptown
Most of the northern part of the island of Manhattan is comprised of
three major neighborhoods, each with their own distinct characters.
The Upper West Side
Located to the west of Central Park, the Upper West Side is bordered by
Columbus Circle, the Time Warner Center and Lincoln Center to the
south, and Columbia University and the Cathedral of St. John the Divine
to the north. The area is home to some beautiful, historic residential
buildings, such as The Dakota, where John Lennon lived and died, and
The Ansonia, once the home of Babe Ruth. Other streets are lined with
brownstones, townhouses, and apartment buildings. In the past decade,
the area has grown tremendously with a proliferation of superstores,
movie theaters, and some very good new restaurants. Also in this neigh-
borhood, you find the American Museum of Natural History. Though it’s
a bit away from the action of Midtown and downtown, the Upper West
Side is a good option for reasonable hotels.
The Upper East Side
To the east of Central Park and stretching to the East River, the Upper
East Side’s main draw is Museum Mile, a stretch of Fifth Avenue that
includes the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Guggenheim, the Museum
of the City of New York, the International Center of Photography, the
Frick Museum, and the Jewish Museum, all within a walkable stretch.
Madison Avenue from 60th Street well into the 80s is the monied crowd’s
main shopping strip. The neighborhood has an upper-crust, old-money
feel and, west of Lexington Avenue, is generally pretty quiet after sun-
down. East of Lexington along Third, Second, and First avenues, you
encounter a number of lively restaurants and clubs.
Harlem
Harlem stretches from about 96th Street east of Fifth Avenue and 110th
Street west of Fifth to 155th Street. Spanish Harlem (El Barrio) runs
between East 100th and East 125th streets. Harlem real estate has shot
Part III: Settling Into New York City 
84

up the past few years; restaurants, new apartments, and clubs are begin-
ning to line the streets, and historic brownstones are constantly being
restored. Exploring the area is becoming safer and safer, and that’s a
very good thing considering there’s so much to see here, such as the
Morris-Jumel Mansion, the Schomburg Center, the Studio Museum, and
the Apollo Theatre. Above Harlem, you’ll find Washington Heights and
Fort Tryon Park, home to the Cloisters annex of the Metropolitan
Museum of Art.
Finding Information after You Arrive
The following places can help you get your bearings after you arrive in
New York:
 NYC & Company (the former Convention & Visitors Bureau) has a
Visitor Information Center (810 Seventh Ave. between 52nd and
53rd streets; % 212-484-1200; www.nycvisit.com; Open: Mon–Fri
8:30 a.m.–6 p.m., Sat–Sun 9 a.m.–5 p.m.) where you can find useful
printed material, pick up coupons for theaters and attractions, and
buy tickets for New York’s top sights, as well as the CityPass (see
Chapter 11). Together with American Express and CitySearch.com,
NYC & Co. has developed electronic kiosks at various locations in
the city, called Ticket axis (see the second-to-last item in this list).
Using the touch-screen, you can get directions and get information
about attractions and events.
 The Grand Central Partnership (Grand Central Terminal, East 42nd
Street and Vanderbilt Avenue; Open: Mon–Fri 8:30 a.m.–6:30 p.m.,
Sat–Sun 9 a.m.–6 p.m.) offers an information window inside Grand
Central Terminal and a cart outside.
 The Manhattan Mall (Sixth Avenue and 32nd Street; Open: Mon–Sat
10 a.m.–8 p.m., Sun 11 a.m.–6 p.m.; % 212-465-0500) offers traveler
information on the first floor.
 The 34th Street Partnership (Penn Station, Seventh Avenue between
31st and 33rd streets; Open: Mon–Fri 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Sat–Sun 
9 a.m.–6 p.m.; % 212-719-3434; www.34thstreet.org) has a window
inside Penn Station and an information cart at the Empire State
Building at Fifth Avenue and 32nd Street. You find carts at Greeley
Square (32nd Street at Broadway and Sixth Avenue) in the summer
and at Madison Square Garden (above Penn Station at Seventh
Avenue and 32nd Street) in above-freezing weather. The carts open 
a little later and close a little earlier than the indoor window.
 Ticket axis kiosks are electronic touch-screen kiosks offering infor-
mation and tickets at the touch of a finger. The number of locations
is increasing, but at press time, kiosks can be found at the Visitor
Information Center (see first bullet in this list), New York Skyride
(on the second floor of the Empire State Building), Intrepid Sea-Air-
Space Museum, Circle Line Tours, Museum of the City of New York,
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 85

New York Hall of Science (in Queens), New York Botanical Gardens
(in the Bronx), Museum of American Financial History (26 Broadway
at Wall Street), and Brooklyn Museum of Art (Brooklyn).
 The Times Square Visitors Center, 1560 Broadway, between 46th
and 47th streets (where Broadway meets Seventh Avenue), on the
east side of the street (% 212-768-1560; www.timessquarebid.
org), is the city’s top info stop. This pleasant and attractive center
features a helpful info desk offering loads of citywide information.
There’s also a tour desk selling tickets for Gray Line bus tours and
Circle Line boat tours; a Metropolitan Transportation Authority
(MTA) desk staffed to sell MetroCard fare cards, provide public
transit maps, and answer all your questions about the transit
system; a Broadway Ticket Center providing show information 
and selling full-price show tickets; ATMs and currency exchange
machines; and computer terminals with free Internet access cour-
tesy of Yahoo!. It’s open daily from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
Getting Around New York
You may not be used to riding a subway, taking a bus, hailing a taxi, or,
yes, walking to where you want to go, but that’s what New Yorkers do
(few own cars, and those who do use them only on weekends to get out
of the city). You’ll find yourself doing the same. The guidelines and tips
in this section will have you navigating the island of Manhattan like a
native in no time. Remember that taxis, subways, and most buses run 
24 hours a day.
Traveling by subway
Besides walking, riding the subway is my preferred mode of transporta-
tion. And some 3.5 million people seem to agree with me each day,
because they ride it, too. The subway is quick, inexpensive, relatively
safe, and pretty efficient, as well as being a genuine New York experience.
The subway runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The rush-hour crushes
are roughly from 8–9:30 a.m. and from 5–6:30 p.m. on weekdays; the
trains are relatively uncrowded the rest of the time.
The subway fare is $2 (half price for seniors and those with disabilities),
and children under 44 inches tall ride free (up to three per adult).
For more information visit www.mta.nyc.ny.us/nyct/subway.
Finding the entrance and getting on board
You can easily locate a subway entrance along the sidewalk by looking
for a set of stairs that heads underground. Most stops also have signs
above them that list the lines that run through those stations.
Part III: Settling Into New York City 
86

Some subway entrances close at night. Each stairway has a globe on top
of it that’s supposed to tell you whether the entrance is open (green for
open, red for closed), but the globes aren’t always accurate; look down
the stairs to find out whether the entrance is open (a big clue is if there’s
a locked gate at the bottom of the staircase!).
The famous New York City subway token was phased out in 2003 and
now the only way to gain entry to the subway is with the MetroCard, a
magnetically encoded card that debits the fare when swiped through the
turnstile (or the fare box on any city bus). After you’re in the system,
you can transfer freely to any subway line that you can reach without
exiting your station. MetroCards also allow you free transfers between
the bus and subway within a two-hour period.
MetroCards can be purchased from each station’s staffed token booth
(which is what they’re still called, even though the token itself has been
phased out), where you can only pay with cash. At the ATM-style vending
machines now located in just about every subway station, you can pay
with cash, credit cards, and debit cards. See the section “Understanding
the MetroCard,” later in this chapter, for details.
The Cheat Sheet at the front of this book shows you the pertinent
subway stops, and all the maps in this book also show subway stops.
You can usually find a subway map inside each subway car, on the plat-
form, and on the wall in the subway station. You also can get a detailed
subway map from the token booth inside each station.
Getting where you want to go
If you need directions in the subway, trying to get information from the
token-booth attendant can be frustrating. The acoustics are horrible, 
the people behind you are impatient, and it’s difficult to make yourself
heard. Instead, pick out a friendly or knowledgeable face; you’d be sur-
prised how willing we New Yorkers are to help out.
The orientation of the subway system is mainly north-south (or uptown-
downtown); you can find only a few points at which the lines go straight
east-west. To travel up and down the west side (and also to the Bronx
and Brooklyn), take the 1, 2, or 3, line; the A, C, or E line; or the B, D, or 
F line.
The N, R, Q, and W lines first cut diagonally across town from east to
west and then snake under Seventh Avenue before shooting out to
Queens.
The crosstown S line, the Shuttle, runs back and forth between Times
Square and Grand Central Terminal. The 7 line also goes from Times
Square to Grand Central Station (with a stop at Fifth Avenue). Farther
downtown, across 14th Street, the L line works its own crosstown magic.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 87

Lines have assigned colors on subway maps and trains — red for the 1,
2, 3, line; green for the 4, 5, 6 trains; and so on — but nobody ever refers
to them by color. Always refer to them by number or letter when asking
questions. Within Manhattan, the distinction between different num-
bered trains that share the same line is usually that some are express
and others are local.
Express trains often skip about three stops for each one that they make;
express stops are indicated on subway maps with a white (rather than
solid) circle. Local stops usually come about 9 blocks apart.
Directions are almost always indicated using “Uptown” (northbound)
and “Downtown” (southbound), so be sure to know what direction you
want to head in. The outsides of some subway entrances are marked
UPTOWN ONLY or DOWNTOWN ONLY; read carefully, because it’s easy to head in
the wrong direction. After you’re on the platform, check the signs over-
head to make sure that the train you’re waiting for is traveling in the right
direction. If you do make a mistake and get on the wrong train, it’s a good
idea to wait for an express station, like 14th Street or 42nd Street, so you
can get off and change for the other direction without paying again.
Staying safe
To keep yourself safe in the subway, heed this advice:
 At night, use the off-hours waiting areas, which are usually close to
the exits to the street. They’re clearly marked with signs overhead.
 Don’t tempt thieves by displaying money or valuables on the
subway.
 Don’t try to stop a subway door that’s closing. You can end up with
a bruised hand or arm — or something more serious. Just wait for
the next train.
 Always stand a few feet back from the tracks on the subway 
platform.
 Avoid subways late at night, and splurge on a cab after about 10 or
11 p.m. — it’s money well spent to avoid a long wait on a deserted
platform. Or take the bus.
Traveling by bus
The New York City bus system reaches far and wide, traveling to just
about all points of the city on a north-south and an east-west grid. You
even get a tour of the city as you ride! Remember that because traffic can
be horrific during the day, buses are much slower going than the subway.
To check out the bus routes, grab one of the free city bus maps available
right by the front door of every bus and also in the booths at subway
stations. If you want to scan the routes before you get to town, you can
access full bus maps via the Internet at www.mta.info.
Part III: Settling Into New York City 
88

Bus stops are located every couple of blocks along each route. The stop
is either a small, glass-walled shelter or a simple sign on a post (blue
with a bus icon) stating the bus numbers. Each bus has a sign above 
the windshield that flashes its route and end destination. Schedules for
buses are posted at most bus stops and are relatively reliable. The buses
run every 5 to 20 minutes or so, depending on the time of day.
Some buses are labeled “Limited” and make only a few major stops along
the line; they’re particularly useful when you want to go a long distance.
These express buses are designated only by an orange “Limited” sign
placed on the dashboard to the right of the driver. Limited bus stops
also display the orange sign.
Like the subway fare, bus fare is $2 — half price for seniors and riders
with disabilities, free for children under 44 inches (up to three per adult).
The fare is payable with a MetroCard or exact change. Bus drivers don’t
make change, and fare boxes don’t accept dollar bills or pennies. You
can’t purchase MetroCards on the bus, so you have to have them before
you board.
If you pay with a MetroCard, you can transfer to another bus or to the
subway for free within two hours. If you pay cash, you must request a
free transfer slip that allows you to change to an intersecting bus route
only (legal transfer points are listed on the transfer paper) within one
hour of issue. Transfer slips cannot be used to enter the subway.
All buses in Manhattan, and 95 percent of New York City buses in the
other boroughs, are equipped with wheelchair lifts and special areas
where the seats in the back fold up to make room for securing wheel-
chairs on board. The buses also “kneel,” scrunching down when they
stop so that the first step is not quite so high up.
The Alliance for Downtown New York’s Downtown Connection offers a
free bus service that provides access to important Downtown destina-
tions including Battery Park City, the World Financial Center, and South
Street Seaport. The service, which operates from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven
days a week, brings Lower Manhattan residents, workers, and visitors
closer to downtown businesses, events, shopping, and attractions.
The Downtown Connection’s five-mile route runs in two directions: from
Chambers Street on the West Side to Beekman Street on the East Side.
The service makes stops at dozens of locations and is able to transport
about 30 passengers per bus (20 seats and 10 standees). Six buses run
on weekdays and four buses on the weekend.
The climate-controlled buses are ADA-wheelchair accessible and run on
ultra-low sulfur fuel. Each vehicle is also equipped with diesel-particulate
filters and electronically controlled fuel-injected engines. For more infor-
mation on the Downtown Connection, call the Downtown Alliance at 
% 212-566-6700, or visit www.downtownny.com.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 89

Understanding the MetroCard
The MetroCard fare card is a high-tech system that encodes a certain
number of rides on a magnetic strip on the back of a thin plastic card.
MetroCards are accepted on both buses and subways and have a lot of
advantages over tokens: They don’t weigh a ton, you can slip the card in
your wallet or pocket, you can buy and recharge it in an automatic vend-
ing machine, you get a free ride for every $10 you spend, and last but not
least, you get one free transfer between bus and subway (or vice versa)
for each ride as long as you make the transfer within two hours of your
initial boarding.
Two types of MetroCards are available for purchase:
 Pay-Per-Ride is the regular card I just described, which can be used
for up to four people by swiping up to four times (bring the whole
family). You can put any amount from $4 (two rides) to $80 on your
card. Every time you put $10 or $20 on your Pay-Per-Ride MetroCard,
it’s automatically credited with an additional 20 percent — that’s one
free ride for every $10 you spend, or six trips for the price of five.
You can refill your card at any subway station at any time until 
its expiration date, which is usually about a year from the date of
purchase.
 Unlimited-Ride can’t be used for more than one person at a time or
more frequently than 18-minute intervals. These cards are available
in three values: the Daily Fun Pass, which allows you a day’s worth
of unlimited subway and bus rides for $7; the 7-Day MetroCard,
for $24; and the 30-Day MetroCard, for $76. Seven- and thirty-day
Unlimited-Ride MetroCards can be purchased at any subway sta-
tion or MetroCard merchant.
Fun Passes can’t be purchased at token booths — you can only buy
them at a MetroCard vending machine, from a MetroCard merchant,
or at the MTA information desk at the Times Square Visitors Center.
Unlimited-Ride MetroCards go into effect the first time you use 
them — so if you buy a card on Monday and don’t use it until
Wednesday, Wednesday is when the clock starts ticking. A Fun 
Pass is good from the first time you use it until 3 a.m. the next day,
while 7- and 30-day MetroCards run out at midnight on the last day.
These unlimited MetroCards can’t be refilled; throw them out once
they’ve been used up and buy a new one.
In addition to being sold in the subway, MetroCards are sold at many
hotels and in thousands of shops all over town (if a shop offers the card,
it has a sign in its window saying so).
The MetroCard has one corner snipped off and a small hole on one side.
To use your MetroCard in the subway, swipe the card horizontally
Part III: Settling Into New York City 
90

through the reader in the same direction you’re traveling, with the cut-
off corner on top and at the back (and between your fingers) and the
little hole leading the way. To use your MetroCard on the bus, insert the
card downward into the machine with the snipped-off corner up and to
the left, the little hole on the bottom and the side with the magnetic
strip facing you. The machine eats the card momentarily and then spits
it back out and beeps — also displaying, for your information, how much
money is left on your card.
Seniors and persons with disabilities get a 50 percent discount with the
MTA New York City Transit. You can apply for the discount by writing to
Customer Assistance Division, MTA, 370 Jay St., 7th Floor, Brooklyn, NY
11201. Or you can download the application from the MTA Web site
(www.mta.info), or call % 718-330-1234. You can recharge your dis-
counted MetroCard at the vending machines and ticket booths in
subway stations.
Traveling by taxi
There are times when I have to break down, open my wallet, and get into
a taxi. Like when I’m late, it’s not rush hour, and I need to be somewhere
fast. Or when I’m not near public transportation, if I’m with a group of
three or four, or if it’s just too late at night and I want to be home safe
and fast, then a taxi is my best option.
Taking a cab costs you $2.50 for the initial charge, plus 40¢ per 1⁄5 mile 
or 40¢ per 120 seconds waiting charge, plus a 50¢ night surcharge (from
8 p.m.–6 a.m.) and a $1 surcharge between 4 to 8 p.m. The average fare
in Manhattan is $7.
When you’re waiting on the street for an available taxi, look at the
medallion light on the top of oncoming cabs. If the light is out, the taxi
is in use. When the center part (the number) is lit, the taxi is available —
this is when you raise your hand to flag the cab. If all the lights are on,
the driver is off duty. A taxi can’t take more than four people, so expect
to split up if your group is larger. If it’s raining and it’s rush hour and
everyone is looking for a cab, either be prepared to battle it out amongst
the seasoned New York cab riders, or do what I do and head for the
nearest subway station.
Follow these suggestions to make your ride as smooth as possible:
 When announcing your destination to the driver, speak clearly.
Remember that English is probably not your driver’s first language.
 Try to know the cross-street of your destination (“Third Avenue
and 41st Street”). Many drivers don’t know the city as well as you
may expect, and if you give a specific street address (like “1500
Broadway”), the driver may not immediately know the exact loca-
tion, and his confusion may end up costing you more money.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 91

 If your driver is driving too fast for you, ask him nicely to slow
down. You have the right to a safe (as well as a smoke-free and
noise-free) trip.
 Have your money ready (you can track the charge on the meter;
remember to add the 50¢ night surcharge and the $1 4-to-8 p.m sur-
charge). You want to disembark rapidly to avoid traffic jams.
 Have small bills with you when boarding a cab; drivers generally
don’t accept bills larger than $20.
 Tip 15 percent.
 Ask for a receipt: It has the taxi medallion number on it, which is a
useful detail if you forget something in the car.
 Check that you have all your belongings before leaving. Taxi drivers
are usually very honest, but the same is not necessarily true of the
customers who use the cab immediately after you.
 Disembark from the curbside door to avoid the stream of traffic
that is dodging around your stopped vehicle on the other side.
 Wear a seat belt — accidents can happen.
 Remember your taxi’s medallion number (which is listed on 
your printed receipt). If you leave anything behind in the cab or 
if you want to register a complaint, call the Taxi and Limousine
Commission Consumer Hotline (% 212-NYC-TAXI or 212-692-8294)
and reference the medallion number to help identify your driver.
Seeing New York on Foot
Walking is one of the preferred modes of transportation in New York —
at least it’s one of mine. Walking not only lets you ponder the wonder
that is New York, it’s also good exercise. And best of all: It’s free.
When walking in New York, however, don’t do as we New Yorkers do. We
zigzag across the streets, rush against the lights, dodge taxis and buses,
and tempt fate on an almost daily basis. So be smart and exercise some
caution when walking. Always be careful when crossing the street, even
when you have the light; drivers sometimes get distracted. And cross
only at crosswalks. Keep your eyes open for distracted walkers who
sometimes resemble NFL blockers. And if you’re gawking at some amaz-
ing edifice, do it standing still. Otherwise you may find yourself flattened
by one of those blockers.
Walk as if you’re driving, staying to the right. Unfortunately, most bicy-
clists seem to think that the traffic laws don’t apply to them; they often
blithely fly through red lights and dash the wrong way on one-way
streets, so be on your guard.
Part III: Settling Into New York City 
92

As I mentioned, walking is sometimes faster than taking the bus and
sometimes even taking a taxi. Traffic can move through Midtown at a
snail’s pace — especially during rush hours — and pedestrians typically
outdistance cars and buses by blocks.
If you plan to do a lot of walking, be sure to bring comfortable shoes!
You’ll not only be on your feet seeing the city all day, but you’ll probably
be on your feet indoors, too — you can rack up a lot of mileage inside
the Metropolitan Museum of Art, for example.

Best Hotels

 Arriving without a reservation
 Deciding among New York’s best hotels
 Choosing a backup if your favorite isn’t available
W
ith more than 230 hotels and 70,000 hotel rooms, the sleeping
options in New York are staggering. Do you want to spend most
of your travel budget on a luxurious hotel? Do you want to stay close to
the neon and noise of Times Square? Do you want a room with a view of
Central Park? Do you want a room vastly bigger than your linen closet
back home? These are just some of the questions you need to ask your-
self before you book a room.
Getting to Know Your Options
In some cities and regions, chain hotels might be the most prevalent
option, but that’s not the case in New York City. In this section, I briefly
discuss nationally known chains with hotels in New York as well as one-of-
a-kind hostelries and bed and breakfasts you can find only in New York.
Independent hotels
Most of the hotels I list in this chapter fall in the class of independent
hotels (versus hotel chains) because I feel that such hotels give you
more of a taste of the city. Don’t be misled, though; in New York, inde-
pendent hotels include everything from huge business hotels run by
large corporations — or by the master builder, Donald Trump — to small
boutique hotels that are family-owned and run the gamut from very
expensive to inexpensive.

Chain hotels
Just a few of the hotels I list in this chapter are major national chains.
Far from the kind of cookie-cutter sameness you may find elsewhere, the
chains I choose, usually moderate to inexpensive in price, hold up well
in comparison to similarly located independent hotels. (See the Quick
Concierge for the toll-free numbers and Web sites of New York’s major
chain hotels.)
Bed & Breakfasts and inns
New York is not the Berkshires, where there are B&Bs galore. Still, the
city has some very nice B&Bs and inns (usually in historic brownstones
in residential neighborhoods) that offer quaint alternatives to the typi-
cally big, cold behemoth of a hotel the city is more famous for. If you’d
like to check out some B&B options, try these associations and reserva-
tion agencies:

Finding the Best Room at the Best Rate
In all but the smallest accommodations, the rate you pay for a room
depends on many factors — chief among them being how you make your
reservation. A travel agent may be able to negotiate a better price with
certain hotels than you can get by yourself. (That’s because the hotel
often gives the agent a discount in exchange for steering his or her busi-
ness toward that hotel.)
Chapter 9: Checking In at New York’s Best Hotels 95

The rack rate is the maximum rate a hotel charges for a room. It’s the
rate you get if you walk in off the street and ask for a room for the night.
You sometimes see these rates printed on the fire/emergency exit dia-
grams posted on the back of your door.
Hotels are happy to charge you the rack rate, but you can almost always
do better. The best way to avoid paying the rack rate is surprisingly
simple: Just ask for a cheaper or discounted rate. You may be pleasantly
surprised.
Room rates (even rack rates) change with the season, as occupancy rates
rise and fall. But even within a given season, room prices are subject to
change without notice, so the rates quoted in this book may be different
from the actual rate you receive when you make your reservation.
As you proceed with the selection process, don’t forget that the basic
rate a hotel charges you isn’t what you end up paying. The hotel tax in
New York City is 13.25 percent, and don’t forget the room charge of $2
per night. When you reserve a room, make sure to find out whether the
price you’re being quoted includes taxes.
You don’t have to just take the room and rate that a hotel offers you. With
a little know-how, you can get the room you want at a price you can afford.
Below are some tried-and-true tips to help you locate the best room for
the best available price.
Trying out a travel agent
Hotels sometimes have discount rates that they offer only to that dying
breed: the travel agent. But you can usually get the same discount from
the Internet. But then you have to do the work. So if you’re shy about bar-
gaining, an agent may be better equipped to negotiate discounts for you.
Taking the do-it-yourself approach
The following tips can help you save money on your room if you decide
to reserve a room without using a travel agent:
 Ask for the best rate. Sometimes the easiest approach is a straight-
forward one. A hotel typically won’t extend its discount room rates
unless you ask for them.
 Mention your memberships. When you reserve a room, mention
your membership in AAA, AARP, frequent-flier programs, and any
other corporate rewards programs you belong to. These member-
ships may shave a few dollars off your room rate.
 Call all available numbers. Most hotels have both a local number
and an 800 central reservation number. Sometimes these numbers
have different rate information. Call both numbers and compare
the rates that each one gives you.

96

Choosing your season carefully
Room rates can vary dramatically — by hundreds of dollars in some
cases — depending on what time of year you visit. Winter (Jan–Mar) is
best for bargains, with summer (especially July and Aug) coming in at
second. Fall is the busiest and most expensive season running from
September right up until the days before Christmas — expect to pay top-
dollar for everything. See Chapter 3 for more information on the best
time to visit the city.
Going uptown or downtown
A New York subway can whisk you anywhere you want to go in minutes,
so you don’t have to stay in Midtown, where the most expensive hotels
are.
You get the best value for your money by staying outside the Theater
District, in the residential neighborhoods where real New Yorkers live,
like Greenwich Village, Chelsea, Murray Hill, or the Upper West Side.
Visiting over a weekend
If your trip includes a weekend, you may be able to save big. Business
hotels tend to empty out on weekends, and rooms that go for $300 or
more Monday through Thursday can drop dramatically, as low as $150
or less, after the execs have headed home. These deals are especially
prevalent in the Financial District, but they’re often available in tourist-
friendly Midtown, too. Look in the Travel section of the Sunday New York
Times for some of the best weekend deals, which are also often adver-
tised on a hotel’s Web site. Or just ask when you call.
Buying a money-saving package deal
A travel package that gets your plane tickets and your hotel stay for one
price just may be the best bargain of all. In some cases, you get airfare,
accommodations, transportation to and from the airport, plus extras like
a sightseeing tour or discount coupons to shows or restaurants. All this
may be less than the hotel alone would have cost had you booked it
yourself. See Chapter 5 for more information.
Avoid excess charges and hidden costs
When you book a room, ask whether the hotel charges for parking. Use
your own cellphone, pay phones, or prepaid phone cards instead of dial-
ing direct from hotel phones, which usually have exorbitant rates. And
don’t be tempted by the room’s minibar offerings: Most hotels charge
through the nose for water, soda, and snacks. Finally, ask about local
taxes and service charges, which can increase the cost of a room by 15%
or more. If a hotel insists upon tacking on a surprise “energy surcharge”
that wasn’t mentioned at check-in or a “resort fee” for amenities you
didn’t use, you can often make a case for getting it removed.
Chapter 9: Checking In at New York’s Best Hotels 97

Investigating reservation services
These outfits usually work as consolidators, buying up or reserving
rooms in bulk, and then dealing them out to customers at a profit. You
can get 10 to 50 percent off; but remember, these discounts apply to rack
rates — inflated prices that people rarely end up paying. You may get a
decent rate, but always call the hotel directly to see if you can do better.
See Chapter 5 for more information.
Surfing the Web for hotel deals
Hotels often offer “Internet only” deals that can save you 10 to 20 per-
cent over what you’d pay if you booked over the telephone. Also, hotels
often advertise all of their available deals on their Web sites, so you
don’t have to rely on a reservation agent to fill you in. What’s more,
some of the discount reservations agencies (see below) have sites that
allow you to book online. 
And consider joining the Playbill Online Theater Club (www.playbill
club.com), a free service that offers some excellent members-only rates
at select city hotels, in addition to discounts on theater tickets. American
Automobile Association members can often score the best discounts by
booking at www.aaa.com. 
Travel search sites such as Orbitz (www.orbitz.com), Expedia (www.
expedia.com), Priceline (www.priceline.com), and Travelocity
(www.travelocity.com) offer other discount options. Shop around.
And if you have special needs — a quiet room, a room with a view — 
call the hotel directly and make your needs known after you’ve booked
online.
Shopping online for hotels is generally done one of two ways: by booking
through the hotel’s own Web site or through an independent booking
agency (or a fare-service agency like Priceline). These Internet hotel
agencies have multiplied in mind-boggling numbers of late, competing
for the business of millions of consumers surfing for accommodations
around the world. This competitiveness can be a boon to consumers
who have the patience and time to shop and compare the online sites
for good deals — but shop you must, for prices can vary considerably
from site to site. And keep in mind that hotels at the top of a site’s listing
may be there for no other reason than that they paid money to get the
placement.
Priceline’s booking process allows you to select which neighborhood
you want to stay in; start with downtown and the Upper East and West
Sides with your lowest bids.
On the downside, many hotels stick Priceline guests in their least 
desirable rooms. Be sure to go to the BiddingforTravel Web site (www.
biddingfortravel.com) before bidding on Priceline; it features a fairly
up-to-date list of hotels that Priceline uses in major cities. For both
Priceline and Hotwire, you pay upfront, and the fee is nonrefundable.
Part III: Settling Into New York 
98

Note: Some hotels do not provide loyalty program credits or points or
other frequent-stay amenities when you book a room through opaque
online services.
In addition, you can read descriptions of some hotels online through
NYC & Company, the New York City Convention & Visitors Bureau 
(% 212-484-1222; www.nycvisit.com). Some of the descriptions offer
links to individual hotel Web sites, allowing you to book your room online.
Hotelguide.com (www.hotelguide.com) is another source of information
about New York hotels. Citysearch (newyork.citysearch.com) and
TripAdvisor (www.tripadvisor.com) have hotel guides as well.
Finding the top-notch room
After you make your reservation, asking one or two more pointed ques-
tions can go a long way toward making sure you get the best room in the
house. Always ask for a corner room; they’re usually larger, quieter, and
have more windows and light than standard rooms, and they don’t always
cost more. Also ask if the hotel is renovating; if it is, request a room away
from the renovation work. Inquire, too, about the location of the restau-
rants, bars, and discos in the hotel –– all sources of annoying noise.
Street noise in New York can be deafening, but many hotels have double-
paned or soundproofed windows. If you’re a light sleeper, ask whether
the room you’ve booked is facing the street or off the street. And if you
aren’t happy with your room when you arrive, talk to the front desk. If
they have another room, they should be happy to accommodate you,
within reason.
Arriving without a Reservation 
(Not Recommended)
Your lodging options may be limited if you arrive without a reservation.
However, making a few phone calls can get you a room most of the time.
As with airline travel, services that call themselves consolidators or
wholesalers purchase lots of rooms at a big discount and then pass some
of the savings on to you. The hotel stays full, the consolidator makes
money, and you may save a lot (or only a little) in the bargain. Money
aside, consolidator and reservation services often can get you a room
when you can’t find one anywhere else. The service usually makes you
pay for your stay upfront and in full; however, you’ve gotta pay some-
time, and this way, the figure may be more like what you had in mind.
If you arrive in New York without a reservation and have trouble booking
directly with the hotels, then try the following bureaus:
 Quikbook (% 800-789-9887; www.quikbook.com): Covers 50
hotels; discounts can reach 60 percent
Chapter 9: Checking In at New York’s Best Hotels 99

 Turbotrip.com (% 800-473-7829; www.turbotrip.com): Provides
comprehensive lodging and travel information for destinations
throughout the United States and worldwide
 Hotel Discounts (% 800-715-7666; www.hoteldiscounts.com): Is
another good source for last minute reservations
New York City’s Best Hotels
Hotel rates in New York are the most expensive in the United States. In
2005, the average price of a hotel room was close to $230 per night. And,
not only are you paying more for your room, you are getting less than
you would in other cities. Here is a breakdown of what sort of space and
amenities you can expect at each price level.
Getting what you pay for: Picking a price range
Each hotel listing is prefaced with a number of dollar signs ranging from
one ($) to five ($$$$$), corresponding to price. This is roughly what you
can expect in terms of room size and standard amenities in each of these
price categories:
 $ ($99–$150): These hotels are true bargains, but services are
sparse. Your room will probably be small, you might have to share
a bathroom, and don’t expect room service, fitness equipment,
movie or cable channels, or bellhops.
 $$ ($150–$250): Expect these rooms to be a little larger and of
better quality and comfort than those in the first category. You may
have access to a fitness center and business facilities, and the hotel
may throw in a complimentary continental breakfast and/or free
Internet service.
 $$$ ($250–$350): Typically, you get room service, a phone with a
dataport, probably a refrigerator and perhaps some kind of minimal
cooking facility, cable TV and/or DVD/VCR, free access to a health
club, wireless Internet, complimentary breakfast or beverages (and
possibly afternoon wine and cheese), and an on-site restaurant.
 $$$$ ($350–$500): On top of the amenities listed for the preceding
category, you can expect plenty of space, fine furnishings, a variety
of dining and drinking options in the hotel, and excellent service.
Because these hotels often cater to businesspeople, they some-
times offer special amenities like complimentary car service to the
Financial District.
 $$$$$ ($500 and up): In this range, you get more than a place to
stay: You get an experience. These hotels have style, elegance, and
a reputation for impeccable service.

Affinia Dumont
$$$$
Midtown East
Located a bit away from the center of Midtown, but still within easy walk-
ing distance of Herald Square shopping, the Empire State Building,
Madison Square Garden, and Grand Central Station, this may be New
York’s only fitness suite hotel. When you book a room, you can request a
“Fit Kit” that will be prepared, with no extra charge, to be used if you only
have time to work out in your room. The hotel also has a complete fitness
spa with the most advanced weights, cardio equipment, and massage and
skin treatments. But even if you don’t want to break a sweat during your
stay, the hotel features amenities that make it a very attractive option,
including a full kitchen, at least one 27-inch television, a large desk with
an ergonomic chair, the “Affinia Bed” with a custom-designed mattress,
four-selection “pillow menu,” and a minibar stocked with unusual options,
such as health elixirs.

The Algonquin
$$$
Midtown West
The atmosphere in this 1902-built landmark building is so steeped in writ-
ers’ lore that you’ll feel guilty turning on the television instead of reading
the latest issue of the New Yorker that’s provided in each of the guest
rooms. Rooms can be extremely cramped but they are equipped with pos-
sibly the most comfortable, inviting beds in the city as well as 21st-century
technology like high-speed Internet and flat-screen televisions. If you have
a tendency toward claustrophobia, head to the plush lobby where you can
sit in cushy chairs, sip exquisite (and expensive) cocktails, have a snack, or
just read or play on your laptop (the lobby is Wi-Fi equipped). Meals are
served in the celebrated Round Table Room, while the fabulous Oak Room
is one of the city’s top cabaret rooms. The publike Blue Bar is home to a
rotating collection of Al Hirschfeld drawings that’s well worth a browse.

The Benjamin
$$$$
Midtown East
From the Jazz Age design of the exterior and lobby, you would never know
that the Benjamin is a relatively new hotel. But after you check into your
spacious room and notice the numerous high-tech amenities, such as Bose
Wave radios, Internet browsers for the televisions, high-speed Internet
access, and an ergonomic chair at an executive desk with moveable 
Chapter 9: Checking In at New York’s Best Hotels 105

workstation, you know you are definitely in the 21st century. Many of the
amenities are geared toward business travelers, but why should they be
the only ones to experience all this comfort and luxury? All rooms are airy,
but the deluxe studio and one-bedroom suites are extra large. The hotel
even offers a few one-bedroom suites with terraces. How many hotels can
boast a “sleep concierge” who consults with you and recommends the right
choice from a “pillow menu” of 11 choices? Lexington Avenue can get very
busy most weeknights and mornings, so if you’re a light sleeper, book a
room off Lexington. Bathrooms feature Frette robes, under-the-counter TV
speakers, a shower caddy, and shower water pressure that’s headstrong
enough to make you think you’ve just experienced a deep-tissue massage.

Casablanca Hotel
$$
Midtown West
Try to picture the exotic, romantic setting of the movie Casablanca — ceil-
ing fans, mosaic tiles, and North African–themed art, and then try to picture
that setting in the heart of neon-blinding, cacophonous Times Square. The
combination seems unlikely, but really, who wouldn’t want a desert oasis
in the middle of all that mayhem? And that’s what the Casablanca Hotel
really is: a calming refuge where you can escape from the noise and crowds.
Rooms might not be the biggest around, but they are well-outfitted with
the aforementioned ceiling fans, bathrobes, free bottles of water, compli-
mentary high-speed Internet access, and beautifully-tiled bathrooms
where, if you wish, you can open the window and let sounds outside remind
you where you really are. Because of its location, moderate prices, and size
(only 48 rooms), the Casablanca is in high demand so book early.
See map p. 102. 147 W. 43rd St. (just east of Broadway). In the heart of Times Square.

The Carlyle-A Rosewood Hotel
$$$$$
Upper East Side
This 34-story grand dame towers over Madison Avenue majestically, per-
fectly epitomizing the old-world, moneyed neighborhood where it stands.
Service is white-glove (literally) and doormen actually wear bowler hats;
the many celebrities or dignitaries, some with faces obscured by silk
scarves, sip tea in the hotel’s cozy Gallery. Guest rooms range from sin-
gles to seven-room suites, some with terraces and full dining rooms. All
have marble bathrooms with whirlpool tubs and all the amenities you’d
expect from a hotel of this caliber. Many suites have breathtaking views of
either downtown or the West Side and Central Park. The Carlyle is also the
Part III: Settling Into New York

home of Bemelmans Bar, Café Carlyle for great cabaret, and the elegant
Carlyle restaurant.

Chelsea Lodge
$
Chelsea
This small hotel housed in a Chelsea brownstone is not only a charmer,
but it’s also a great value for those on a tight budget. Though the rooms are
small, everything is in top-notch condition. Rooms on the first floor have
high ceilings and give the appearance of being bigger. Beds are full-size
and each room has its own sink and in-room shower stall; toilets are
shared. I really like the location in the heart of trendy, yet residential
Chelsea, and coupled with the stylishness of the rooms, you’d be hard-
pressed to do better for the money. Best for couples rather than shares.

Cosmopolitan Hotel–Tribeca
$
TriBeCa
If you’re looking for a budget hotel and you don’t want to share a bath-
room, go downtown to this perfectly decent TriBeCa choice. The modern
IKEA-ish furniture includes a work desk and an armoire (a few rooms have
a dresser and hanging rack instead); for a few extra bucks, you can have a
love seat, too. Beds are comfy, and sheets and towels are of good quality.
Rooms are small but make the most of the limited space, and the whole
place is pristine. The TriBeCa location is safe, superhip, and subway-con-
venient. Don’t expect much in the way of services here, but this is still a
perfectly acceptable choice for the money.

Doubletree Guest Suites Times Square
$$$
Midtown West
Located in the heart of ear-splitting, eye-socket burning Times Square, this
43-story Doubletree, is a wonderland for children. From the fresh-baked
chocolate chip cookies given out upon arrival, the spacious and affordable
suites big enough for two 5-year-olds to play hide-and-seek (as mine did),
and the all-day children’s room-service menu to the proximity to the gar-
gantuan Toys “R” Us, the TKTS Booth, and other kid-friendly Times Square
offerings, this Doubletree is hard to beat for families. Bathrooms have two

Gershwin Hotel
$
Flatiron District
This creative-minded, Warhol-esque hotel caters to up-and-coming artis-
tic types — and well-established names with an eye for good value — with
its bold modern art collection and wild style. The lobby was recently ren-
ovated, and along with a bar, Gallery at the Gershwin, much of the original
art remains. The standard rooms are clean and bright, with Picasso-style
wall murals and Philippe Starck–ish takes on motel furnishings. Superior
rooms are best, as they’re newly renovated, and well worth the extra $10;
all have either a queen bed, two twins, or two doubles, plus a newish pri-
vate bathroom with cute, colorful tile. If you’re bringing the brood, two-
room suites, or Family Rooms, are a good option. The hotel is more
service-oriented than you usually see at this price level, and the staff is
very professional.

Hotel Beacon
$$
Upper West Side
Okay, so you’re not in Times Square or in trendy SoHo, but when you’re at
the Hotel Beacon, you’re on the Upper West Side, and for families, you
won’t find a better location — or value. Close to Central Park and Riverside
Park, the Museum of Natural History and Lincoln Center, and major
subway lines, it’s not like the Beacon is in a desolate spot. Rooms here are
generously sized and feature a kitchenette, a roomy closet, and a new
marble bathroom. Virtually all standard rooms feature two double beds,
and they’re plenty big enough to sleep a family on a budget. The large one-
and two-bedroom suites are some of the best bargains in the city; each has
two closets and a pullout sofa in the well-furnished living room. The two-
bedrooms have a second bathroom, making them well outfitted enough to
house a small army — including my own. There’s no room service, but a
wealth of good budget dining options that deliver, along with excellent
markets like Fairway, make the Beacon even more of a home away from
home.

Hotel Carlton on Madison Avenue
$$$
Flatiron District
This 1904 Beaux Arts hotel, formerly known as the Seville Hotel, was get-
ting very worn around the edges when it was rescued by architect David
Rockwell and refurbished magnificently in 2005. The highlight of that $60
million renovation is the new grand, sweeping lobby complete with a
marble curving staircase and a cathedral-like high ceiling. The Hotel
Carlton has successfully recaptured the majestic glory of the past and
blended it with New Age nods like contemporary furnishings in the lobby
along with a bubbling, two-story waterfall. Rooms are generously sized and
retain that Beaux Arts motif with the addition of modern amenities like
wireless Internet and iPod clock radios. The marble bathrooms offer plenty
of counter space; some rooms have bathtubs while others just have show-
ers. Off the lobby is the acclaimed bi-level restaurant Country where,
above the upstairs dining room, a stained-glass skylight dome that had
been boarded up since World War II has been meticulously restored.

Hotel Elysée
$$$
Midtown East
This romantic gem of a hotel in the heart of Midtown might be easy to
miss; it’s dwarfed by the modern glass towers on either side of it. But that
it is so inconspicuous is part of the Elysée’s immense romantic appeal.
Built in 1926, the hotel has a storied past as the preferred address for
artists and writers. The hotel still retains that sexy, discreet feel and now
is run expertly by HK Hotels (The Giraffe, The Gansevoort, and The
Library). Rooms were recently renovated and have many quirky features;
some have fireplaces, others have kitchens or solariums and all are deco-
rated in country-French furnishings. Good-size bathrooms are done up in
Italian marble and are well outfitted. Off the gorgeous black and white
marble-floored lobby are the legendary Monkey Bar and the restaurant,
The Steakhouse at the Monkey Bar. On the second floor is the Club Room
where a free continental breakfast is offered daily along with complimen-
tary wine and cheese weekday evenings.

Hotel Gansevoort

Meatpacking District
Built from the ground up by hotelier Henry Kallan (of New York’s Hotel
Giraffe and The Library), the Gansevoort became the first major hotel in
Chapter 9: Checking In at New York’s Best Hotels 109

the white-hot Meatpacking district. And now, this sleek, 14-floor zinc-colored
tower, with its open, sprawling clubby lobby, the very popular Jeffrey
Chodorow–owned, Jeffrey Beers–designed restaurant Ono, and the indoor/
outdoor rooftop bar and pool (with music piped underwater), is the sym-
bolic anchor of the district. Despite its potentially excessive trendiness, the
Gansevoort offers, as do all of Henry Kallan’s hotels, excellent, personable
service. Rooms are good-size with comfortable furnishings in soft tones and
high-tech amenities like plasma televisions and wireless Internet. Suites have
a living room and separate bedroom and some have small balconies and bay
windows. The generously sized bathrooms are done up in ceramic, stainless
steel, and marble and are impeccably appointed. In all the guest rooms and
throughout the hotel, original art by New York artists is on display.

Hotel Giraffe
$$$$
Flatiron District
This hotel, in the fashionable Madison Park area, has a cozy, intimate,
lived-in feel to it. Guest rooms evoke an urban European character with
high ceilings, velveteen upholstered chairs, and original black-and-white
photographs from the ’20s and ’30s. All the rooms are good-sized with high
ceilings, and deluxe rooms and suites feature French doors that lead to
small balconies with large windows and remote-controlled blackout
shades. Bathrooms are spacious with plenty of marble counter space and
glass-paneled doors. But the services are what really separate this hotel
from so many others. In the hotel’s elegant lobby, you can find a conti-
nental breakfast and coffee, cookies, and tea are available there all after-
noon. Wine, cheese, and piano music are offered each evening. The lovely
rooftop garden is the perfect place for a glass of wine in the evening or
morning coffee during warm weather.

Hotel Metro

Midtown West
With its Art Deco style, decent-sized rooms, and slew of free amenities, the
Metro, just a block from the Empire State Building, is one of Manhattan’s
best values. The rooms are outfitted with smart retro furnishings, playful
fabrics, and fluffy pillows. Though on the small side, the marble bathrooms
are lovely and have shower stalls big enough for two. The two-room family
suite has a second bedroom in lieu of a sitting area; families on tighter
budgets can opt for a roomy double/double. The comfy, fire-lit library/
lounge area off the lobby, where complimentary buffet breakfast is laid out
and the coffeepot’s on all day, is a popular hangout. The well-furnished

Hotel Newton
$
Upper West Side
On the burgeoning northern extreme of the Upper West Side, the Newton
is a budget hotel that seems to be a notch above in almost every category.
The lobby is small but tasteful, and the rooms are generally large, with
good, firm beds, a work desk, and a sizable new bathroom, plus roomy
closets in most (a few of the cheapest rooms have wall racks only). Some
rooms are big enough to accommodate families with two doubles or two
queen beds. The suites feature two queen beds in the bedroom, a sofa in
the sitting room, plus niceties like a microwave, minifridge, and iron,
making them well worth the few extra dollars. This AAA-approved hotel is
impeccably kept. The 96th Street express subway stop is just a block away,
providing convenient access to the rest of the city, and the Key West Diner
next door is a favorite for huge, cheap breakfasts.

The Hotel on Rivington
$$$$ Lower East Side
The contrast of a gleaming 21-story glass tower luxury hotel located in the
midst of 19th and early 20th century lower east side low-rise tenement
buildings is striking, but an accurate representation of what that neigh-
borhood has become today. You may not be close to the center of
Manhattan if you stay at the Hotel on Rivington, but you will be in a dually
historic and trendy location, where old world customs and institutions
coexist peacefully with the new and the super cool. From the floor-to-ceil-
ing windows of your room, surrounded by modern amenities such as flat
panel televisions, Japanese soaking tubs in the bathrooms, tempur-pedic
mattresses on the beds, you have incredible and totally unobstructed city
views. Along with these views, 75 percent of the rooms have private ter-
races, the option of in-room spa services, and heated, tiled floors in the
large bathrooms. Room service is provided by the hotel’s ultra trendy
restaurant THOR.

Hotel QT

Midtown West
Owned by Andre Balazs, of The Mercer, Hotel QT offers much of the
Mercer’s style without the hefty rates. From its enviable Midtown location
to many extras like a steam room and sauna, free high-speed Internet, com-
plimentary continental breakfast, and good-sized rooms including a number
with bunk beds, Hotel QT, which opened in 2005, is now one of the best
moderate options in the Times Square area. Upon entering, you check in at
a kiosk/front desk where you pick up periodicals or essentials to stock your
minibar. Making your way to the elevators, you might see guests swimming
in the lobby pool or having a drink at the pool’s swim-up bar. The rooms
are sparse in tone, but the platform beds, queen and king-sized, are plush
and come equipped with Egyptian cotton sheets. Bathrooms are small and
sliding doors economically hide either the shower or the toilet. But for
prices this low, along with the extras offered, who are we to quibble?

The Kitano New York
$$$$
Midtown East
This elegant, Japanese-owned, Murray Hill gem offers a unique mix of East
and West sensibilities. The marble and mahogany lobby, with its Y-shaped
staircase and Botero bronze Dog, is one of the most attractive in New York.
The hotel was first opened in 1973; in the mid-1990s, along with acquiring
an 1896 landmark town house next door, the Kitano was fully renovated.
If you’re a very lucky (and wealthy) individual, you’ll get the opportunity
to stay in one of three one-bedroom town house suites, each with sunken
living rooms, bay windows, and original, eclectic art. Or, if your sensibili-
ties are Eastern-oriented, the hotel offers a Tatami suite, with tatami mats,
rice paper screens, and a Japanese Tea Ceremony room. Most rooms are
not quite that luxurious or unique, but all include tasteful mahogany fur-
niture, soundproof windows, and, for a real taste of Japan, green tea upon
arrival. Marble bathrooms are large and have heated towel racks and
removable shower heads. At the mezzanine-level bar, Wednesday through
Saturday evenings turn into the acclaimed Jazz at the Kitano.

Greenwich Village
On a beautiful tree-lined block in a quiet residential part of Greenwich

why it has a loyal European following. Each bright guest room is tastefully

done in rattan and outfitted with a writing desk, a mini-library of books,
an alarm clock, a washbasin, and a few extras that you normally have to

Every floor has two shared bathrooms (with hair dryers) and a small,
simple kitchen. The Larchmont is a great choice if you’re on a budget and
don’t mind sharing a bathroom. And if you’re looking for a trendy down-
town base that’s close to some of the city’s best shopping, dining, and
sightseeing (and your choice of subway lines are just a walk away), you
can’t do much better than the Larchmont Hotel.

Le Parker Meridien
$$$$
Midtown West
With its central location, incredible amenities like the 17,000-square-foot
fitness center with a rooftop pool, and three excellent restaurants, Le
Parker Meridien just about has it all. The gorgeous, always bustling lobby
also serves as a public space, and elevators with televisions that continu-
ously show Tom & Jerry and Rocky & Bullwinkle cartoons and Charlie
Chaplin shorts are a wonder for the kids. The spacious hotel rooms,
though a bit on the IKEA side, have a fun feel to them with hidden draw-
ers and swirling television platforms, inventively exploiting an economi-
cal use of space. The slate and limestone bathrooms are large but
unfortunately come only with a shower. Norma’s serves one of the best
breakfasts in the city, and many, myself included, have rated the burgers
at Burger Joint as the best in the city. A stay at Le Parker Meridien is def-
initely a New York experience in itself.

The Library Hotel
$$$
Midtown East
I’m usually very suspicious of theme hotels, but this one, located a block
from the main branch of the New York Public Library, is an exception. Each
of the ten guestroom floors are dedicated to one of the ten major cate-
gories of the Dewey Decimal System. When I visited the hotel I was appro-
priately booked into the “Geography and Travel” room. There I was
greeted with books, such as Barcelona, by Robert Hughes, and Bella
Tuscany, by Frances Mayes. The most disappointing thing about all those
books is that I was only staying one night and didn’t have the chance to
read any of them. Still, there was something comforting about having them
by my bed. Or maybe it was just the comfy rooms, which come in three

categories: petite (really small), deluxe, and junior suite; and feature
mahogany built-ins, generous desks, and immaculate marble bathrooms.

The Lowell
$$$$$
Upper East Side
The Lowell’s style of luxury is best described as elegant, sophisticated
20th-century opulence. It has the feel of a residential dwelling; the lobby
is small and clubby with first-rate European, old-world service. The rooms
are the real treasures here — each different from the other and all very
good-size. About two-thirds are suites with kitchenettes or fully equipped
kitchens; some have private terraces and most have working fireplaces. In
the rooms you’ll also find nice big, cushy armchairs, lots of leather, inter-
esting artwork, and porcelain figurines scattered about. Bathrooms are
Italian marble and outfitted with Bulgari amenities. The Pembroke Room
offers breakfast, including a hearty English breakfast and afternoon tea
while the Post House is best known for their steaks. On a quiet, tree-lined
street one block from Central Park and right in the middle of Madison
Avenue shopping, the Lowell’s location is ideal for those who want (and
can afford) an urban retreat away from the Midtown madness.

The Lucerne
$$
Upper West Side
This magnificent 1903 landmark building that was recently transformed
into a luxury boutique hotel is a triumph on many levels. The Lucerne best
captures the feel of the Upper West Side, and you won’t do better if you
want to stay in this very special neighborhood. Service here is impeccable,
especially for a moderately priced hotel. The rooms are all comfortable
and big enough for kings, queens, or two doubles with attractive bath-
rooms complete with travertine counters. Some of the rooms have views
of the Hudson River. The suites are extra special here and include kitch-
enettes, stocked minifridges, microwaves, sitting rooms with sofas, and
extra televisions. The highly rated restaurant, Nice Matin, offers room
service or eat-in breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Or you may want to skip
room service and order takeout from nearby Zabar’s or H&H Bagels.

Chapter 9: Checking In at New York’s Best Hotels 115
Country in the city
If you’re looking for an alternative to the quintessential huge New York hotel or if you
want a taste of urban hominess where you may actually meet your innkeeper, you
have a number of options to consider.
On the steep end of the economic scale, but definitely worth the price if authentic 19th-
century Victorian romance is what you’re seeking, is the fabulous Inn at Irving Place,
56 Irving Place (between 17th and 18th streets), (% 800-685-1447 or 212-533-4600;
www.innatirving.com). (See the “Midtown Hotels” map.) Rates range from $325
to $525. All 12 rooms in this 170-year-old townhouse are named after late 19th century
or early 20th century New Yorkers, many inspired by the works of Edith Wharton and
Henry James. Complimentary breakfast is served each morning in Lady Mendl’s parlor,
where, if the weather is nippy, you can find a comforting fire roaring.
Breakfast prepared by culinary students at the New School is one of the highlights of
the Inn on 23rd, 131 W. 23rd St. (between Sixth and Seventh avenues), (% 877-387-2323
or 212-463-0330; www.innon23rd.com). (See the “Midtown Hotels” map.) Each of
the inn’s 14 rooms, which range in price from $219 to $359, was distinctly decorated by
the personable owners, Annette and Barry Fisherman, with items they’ve collected
from their travels over the years.
The first home of the Gay Men’s Health Crisis, an 1850 brownstone in the heart of
Chelsea, is now the charming Colonial House Inn, 318 W. 22nd St. (between Eighth
and Ninth avenues), (% 800-689-3779 or 212-243-9669; www.colonialhouse
inn.com). (See the “Midtown Hotels” map.) This 20-room, four-story walk-up caters
to a largely gay and lesbian clientele, but everybody is welcome, and straight couples
are a common sight. Some rooms have shared bathrooms; deluxe rooms have private
bathrooms, and some have working fireplaces. The inn has a roof deck with a cloth-
ing optional area. Breakfast is included in the rates, which range from $80 to $130 for
a shared bathroom or $135 to $150 for a deluxe.
On the increasingly popular yet still residential Upper West Side is the aptly named
Country Inn the City, 270 W. 77th St. (between Broadway and West End Avenue), 
(% 212-580-4183; www.countryinnthecity.com). (See the “Uptown Hotels”
map.) This 1891 townhouse has only four rooms, but all are spacious, quaintly deco-
rated, and come with full kitchens. Rates range from $150 to $300 and include break-
fast items stocked in your refrigerator. But you’re on your own here in many respects.
You won’t find a resident innkeeper, and a maid only services your room every few
days. Still, if you’re the independent sort, the inn’s charm makes it an excellent choice.

The Mercer
$$$$
SoHo
The best of the downtown, celebrity-crawling, hip and trendy hotels, the
Mercer is a place where even those who represent the antithesis of hip
(and I’m speaking personally) can feel very much at home. The corner of
Mercer and Prince streets, the location of the hotel, is the epicenter of
SoHo, but once inside the hotel there is a pronounced calm — from the
postmodern library lounge and the relaxed Mizrahi-clad staff, to the huge
soundproof loftlike guest rooms; the hotel is a perfect complement to the
scene outside your big window. The Mercer is one of the few New York
hotels with ceiling fans and even if you don’t need to use them, they look
very nice whirring above your extremely comfortable bed. The tile-and-
marble bathrooms have a steel cart for storage and an oversize shower
stall or oversize two-person tub (state your preference when booking).

The Peninsula–New York
$$$$$
Midtown East
Housed in a beauty of a landmark, Beaux Arts building, the Peninsula is
the perfect combination of old-world charm and modern, state-of-the-art
technology. Rooms are huge with plenty of closet and storage space, but
best of all is the bedside control panel that allows you to regulate lighting,
television, stereo, air-conditioning, and signal the DO NOT DISTURB sign on
your door. Even though you really don’t have to leave the comfort of your
bed, eventually you will need to go to the bathroom and when you do,
you’ll not be disappointed. The huge marble bathrooms all have spacious
soaking tubs with yet another control panel at your fingertips including
the controls for, in most rooms, a television so you can watch while taking
your bubble bath (now that’s happy excess). The Peninsula also features
one of the best and biggest New York hotel health clubs and spas, the
rooftop Pen-Top Bar, and a faultless concierge desk. All this wonderful-
ness, however, doesn’t come cheap, but if a splurge is what you want, you
won’t do much better than the Peninsula.

Plaza Athénée
$$$$$
Upper East Side
If money is no object and you don’t want to stray too far from Madison
Avenue shopping, this elegant, sophisticated hideaway is for you. Antique
furniture, hand-painted murals, and the Italian marble floor that adorns
the exquisite lobby give the Plaza Athénée a distinctly European feel.
Part III: Settling Into New York 
116

Service here is as good as it gets with personalized check-in and an atten-
tive staff. The rooms come in a variety of shapes and sizes, but all are high-
ceilinged and spacious with entrance foyers that give them a residential
feel. The suites have so much closet space that this New Yorker, used to
miniscule apartment closets, was very envious. The marble bathrooms are
outfitted with thick robes made exclusively for the hotel; put one on and
you may never want to take it off. The lush lounge is appropriately called
Bar Seine and is a welcome spot for a pre-dinner cocktail. It’s not the most
technologically advanced hotel — the televisions are old and the rooms
don’t have VCRs or DVD players. You don’t come to the Plaza Athénée for
the high-tech life, however; you come to escape it.

Red Roof Inn
$
Midtown West
Manhattan’s first and only Red Roof Inn offers welcome relief from
Midtown’s high-priced hotel scene. Both the rooms and bathrooms are
more spacious than you may find at most hotels in the category. The high-
ceilinged lobby also has an elegant feel, again unusual for a budget hotel.
What’s more, in-room amenities are better than most competitors’, and
furnishings are brand-new, and comfortable. Located very close to the
Empire State Building and Herald Square, on a street in Manhattan’s Little
Korea, the smell of Korean barbecue permeates the air, which can be good
or bad, depending on how you feel about Korean barbecue. Complimentary
continental breakfast adds to the good value.

The Ritz-Carlton New York, Battery Park
$$$$
Financial District
Located on the extreme southern tip of Manhattan, you can’t get further
downtown than this. And if you don’t mind being away from most of the
action, no options are better than this one. Not only do you get typically
excellent Ritz service, but you also get amazing views of New York Harbor
from most guest rooms. You can even use one of the hotel telescopes for
close-ups of Lady Liberty. This modern, Art Deco–influenced high-rise is
different in style than the English countryside look of most Ritz-Carlton
hotels, but that’s where the differences end. Here you find the full slate of
comforts and services typical of Ritz-Carlton, from Frette-dressed feather
beds to the chain’s signature Bath Butler, who will draw a scented bath for

The Ritz-Carlton New York, Central Park
$$$$$
Midtown West
Not only does this Ritz own one of the best locations in the city, on Central
Park South overlooking Central Park, but it also, despite the incredible lux-
uriousness, manages to maintain a homey elegance that does not intimi-
date you with stuffy service or an over-abundance of style. Rooms are
spacious and decorated in traditional, English countryside style. Suites are
larger than most New York City apartments, and rooms facing Central Park
come with telescopes. The marble bathrooms are also oversized and fea-
ture a choice of bathrobes — terry or linen — and extravagant Frederic
Fekkai bath amenities. For families who can afford the very steep prices,
the hotel is extremely kid-friendly. Suites have sofa beds, and cribs and roll-
away beds can be brought in. Adults can enjoy the New York Times three-
star-winning restaurant Atelier and the Switzerland-based La Prairie Spa.

The Roger
$$$
Midtown East
This Murray Hill hotel, formerly known as the Roger Williams, shed its tra-
ditional, slightly worn veneer and was reborn in 2005 with a glitzy, color-
ful new look and style — not to mention a hip name. This Roger wears its
new look very well. The welcoming lobby, which has an odd assortment of
mod, yet comfortable seating, hosts small jazz combos three nights a
week. The rooms come in a number of varieties — some small, some gen-
erous, some with huge landscaped terraces, others with views of the
nearby Empire State building, and all with impressive amenities such as
colorful quilts, flat panel televisions, complimentary high-speed Internet,
and good-sized marble bathrooms. The Roger is now one of the top
choices in what is a quiet, yet convenient Midtown location. A floating
granite staircase leads from the lobby to a mezzanine lounge, where you
can breakfast in the morning and drink cocktails by candlelight at night.

Sofitel New York
$$$
Midtown West
The block of 44th Street between Fifth and Sixth avenues is known as “Hotel
Row,” and some of the hotels there are historic and extremely elegant. The
soaring Sofitel is the newest addition to the block and, in my opinion, the
best of the bunch. Thanks to the hotel’s entrance and the warm, inviting
lobby with check-in tucked off to the side, it feels like you’re entering a
“grande dame” hotel and not one that is no more than five years old. That’s
one of the reasons the hotel is so special. The designers have successfully
melded modern new-world amenities with European old-world elegance.
The rooms are spacious and ultra-comfortable, adorned with art from New
York and Paris. The lighting is soft and romantic, and walls and windows are
soundproofed. Suites are extra special, equipped with king beds, two tele-
visions, and pocket doors separating the bedroom from the sitting room.
Bathrooms in all rooms are magnificent with separate showers and soaking
tubs. A unique gift shop called Le Petit Bijou features hard-to-find fun
French products, including perfumes and cosmetics, and a stylish French
restaurant called Gaby bakes delicious croissants for breakfast.

Waldorf=Astoria and the Waldorf Towers

Midtown East
This massive one-square-block Art Deco masterpiece is not only a hotel
icon, but a genuine New York City landmark and the epitome of old-school
elegance. The lobby is so big and grand, it’s reminiscent of Grand Central
Station, including having its own signature clock. With over 1,000 rooms,
the pace can be hectic, but after you’re in your room, all airy with high
ceilings, traditional décor, comfortable linens and beds, and spacious
marble bathrooms, you quickly forget about that hectic pace and chill out.
If you crave more luxury, book a room on the Astoria level, which features
huge suites, deluxe bathroom amenities, access to the clubby Astoria
Lounge for breakfast or afternoon hors d’oeuvres, and free entry to the
hotel’s fitness club (others pay a fee); or for even more opulence, try a
suite in the Waldorf Towers where most rooms are bigger than New York
City apartments. One of three bars in the hotel, Sir Harry’s Bar (off the
lobby) is the main gathering spot for a pre- or post-dinner cocktail, but

Chapter 10
Dining and Snacking 
in New York City
In This Chapter
 Landing a reservation at a hot restaurant
 Finding out about your dining options
 Getting the most out of your food budget
 Listing the top New York City restaurants
You can’t do better than New York for the dining possibilities; the
city is bursting with restaurants of every type and category. You
could eat out every night of the year and still have a mountain of restau-
rants to climb before you’ve been to them all. Chefs are as famous as
rock stars, and when a new restaurant opens, the pomp and circum-
stance sometimes equals the opening of a major Broadway show. What
I’m trying to say is that eating out in New York is a very big deal —
something many New Yorkers take seriously.
Although I’m intrigued by the food-mania that has gripped Gotham,
maybe we’ve taken it a bit too far. Food and eating should not be taken
too seriously. I’m not completely down on this mania, however. The
upside has been an increase in quality restaurants.
The variety of restaurants in New York is staggering — from American to
multi-ethnic, from a simple diner to an elegant four-star palace. All that
variety can be intimidating, but it shouldn’t be. You know what you like;
now you just need to know where to find it.
Getting the Dish on the Local Scene
Unless the restaurant you’re interested in doesn’t take reservations, it
always pays to make a reservation, especially if your party is bigger than
two. You’ve got nothing to lose by calling ahead. If you’re booking dinner
on a weekend night, it’s a good idea to call a few days in advance if you
can. And if you’re really set on visiting one very special restaurant, let’s
say Aquavit, call well in advance, preferably before you even arrive in
the city.

If you’ve tried and still can’t get a reservation for the dates you want, 
try for an early dinner, between 5 and 6 p.m., or a later one, after 9 p.m.
That’s all you may get offered anyway, so if, for example, your heart is
set on dining at BLT Fish or Maremma while you’re in town, you may
have to take what’s offered.
Most top places start taking reservations 30 days in advance, so if you
want to eat at a hot restaurant at a popular hour — Saturday at 8 p.m.,
say, at Daniel — mark your calendar and start dialing 30 days prior at 
9 a.m. If you’re booking a holiday dinner, call even earlier. Many of the
top restaurants require you to leave a credit card number when making
a reservation, and if you don’t show up, they penalize you with a service
charge.
Smoking
Since the tough new no-smoking laws were imposed in 2003, smoking is
banned in all restaurants all over the city, with the exception of some
outdoor spaces.
Other restaurant sources
The best online restaurant sources are:
 Citysearch (www.citysearch.com): Runs a restaurant page that’s
updated weekly as part of its comprehensive offerings, including
reader reviews
 New York Magazine (www.nymag.com): The online arm of weekly
New York magazine
 New York Today (www.nytoday.com): The New York Times’ arts
and lifestyle site where you can access a database of the paper’s
very influential restaurant reviews
 Village Voice (www.villagevoice.com): Especially good for the
cheap eats reviews by Robert Sietsema
The best online source for the serious foodie is www.chowhound.com, 
a national Web site with message boards in local areas, including New
York, where you can make an inquiry about a certain restaurant, type 
of food, or location, and within a few hours, you may have five or more
very informative responses.
The Zagat Survey (www.zagat.com), though far from my favorite
source because its reviews are often popularity contests, is still a good
online database; consider using it as a starting point. The guide, which
has made a name for itself by rating restaurants based on extensive
diner surveys, maintains a searchable database. It is, however, now
charging a fee to access the online information, which, with all the other
better online options available, is not worth it (in my opinion). Better
just to buy the book.
Part III: Settling Into New York 
126

If you don’t feel the need for a book, stop at any newsstand for a copy of
the slick weekly Time Out New York; the “Eat Out” section includes list-
ings for TONY’s 100 Favorite Restaurants in every issue, as well as cover-
age of new openings and dining trends. Weekly New York magazine also
maintains extensive restaurant listings in the “Cue” section at the back
of the magazine.
Trimming the fat from your budget
Yes, prices in New York are high, but you can eat well without spending a
lot of money if you follow a few simple rules — and you never need to sac-
rifice quality. The best and most famous restaurants are expensive, but
you don’t need to pay through the nose if you keep these tips in mind.
 Go for the prix fixe menu at top restaurants. Usually, the best
deals are at lunch, when many of the best restaurants in New York
offer a special deal — a three-course meal for $20 to $30.
 Drink before you eat. Restaurants get you with the drinks.
That’s where they make their money. If you insist on a bottle of
wine with dinner, it’s gonna cost you. Have your wine at happy
hour before dinner.
 Eat at ethnic restaurants. Most authentic ethnic restaurants are in
the $ category. (See the table later in this chapter.)
 Skip the national fast-food chains and go for local food. It may be
fast, but it’s not as cheap as advertised, and with so many good,
inexpensive local restaurants, you really have no excuse for eating
at a national fast-food chain while in New York.
 Order takeout. Thousands of takeout places all over Manhattan
deliver to hotel rooms for free, and they offer food more varied and
far less expensive than room service. (Don’t forget to tip the deliv-
ery person.)
 Avoid eating in the big tourist centers like Times Square and
Rockefeller Center. Not only are food prices jacked up in these
areas, the food is usually not very good. Try to plan your meals and
snacks for before or after you visit the big tourist sights, or in adja-
cent neighborhoods, rather than busy hubs of visitor activity.
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in New York City 127
Great fixed-price deals at top restaurants
New York’s popular Restaurant Week, held every January and June, pioneered the
idea of offering prix fixe (fixed-price) bargain lunches. In 2006, the price was $24.07
(24/7, get it?) Happily, some of the best restaurants in New York have adopted the idea;
even better, several have extended the offer throughout the year, making it possible to
have a superior culinary experience for an affordable price year-round. Check with
individual restaurants to see if they offer a prix fixe lunch special.

For the listings below I offer two price indicators for each restaurant: a
number of dollar signs, which gives you an idea of what a complete meal
costs; and the price range of the entrees on the menu. Those two pieces
of information can help you choose a place that’s right for you and your
budget.
One dollar sign ($) means inexpensive, and five dollar signs ($$$$$ —
the maximum) means extravagant. The symbols reflect what one person
can expect to pay for an appetizer, entree, dessert, one drink, tax, and
tip. Here’s a more complete key to the dollar-sign ratings that I use in
this chapter:
Dollar Sign(s)
Price Range
$
=
Under $25
$$
=
$25–$35
$$$
=
$35–$50
$$$$
=
$55–$70
$$$$$
=
Over $70
Our dollar signs give you a rough idea of how much a meal will cost, but
don’t use them as the only factor in your decision; restaurants may offer
prix fixe meals or other deals that aren’t reflected in their price rankings.
As you peruse the listings, check the maps in this chapter to pinpoint a
restaurant’s location. The indexes at the end of this chapter can help
you select a restaurant by location, cuisine, or price.
New York’s Best Restaurants
A.O.C. Bedford
$$$$
Greenwich Village
MEDITERRANEAN/FRENCH
You’ll find this brick-walled, cozy romantic charmer tucked away on
equally cozy and romantic Bedford Street in the West Village. Here the
A.O.C. in the restaurant name stands for appellation d’origine contrôlée —
the French designation for high quality food products. But on the menu
you’ll not only find A.O.C. products from France, but D.O.C., the Italian des-
ignation, and D.O., the Spanish. But you really won’t need all those desig-
nations to know that what you are eating is of high quality — just a few
bites will suffice. The paella marinera, a constant on the menu, is prepared
for two, stuffed with jumbo shrimp (heads on for more flavor), squid, scal-
lops, mussels, and clams and cooked perfectly in moist Spanish Calasparra
rice. Finish your meal with a selection of cheeses, A.O.C., D.O.C., and D.O.-
quality only, of course. The restaurant has an impressive wine list, and bot-
tles are, as they should be, decanted at your table.

Aquavit
$$$$$
Midtown East
SCANDINAVIAN
I’ll miss the waterfall and the intimate town house setting that Aquavit
regrettably vacated in early 2005. Thankfully, however, the food and staff
have had no trouble adjusting to the transition. Everything remains impec-
cably first rate. The restaurant is now housed in the bottom of a glass
tower on East 55th Street, and designed in sleek Scandinavian style with
modernist furniture. In the front of the restaurant is an informal and less
expensive cafe while past a long bar is the dining room. 
After the move, if anything, the food has improved. The smoked fish —
really all the fish — is prepared perfectly. I often daydream about the her-
ring plate: four types of herring accompanied by a tiny glass of Aquavit,
distilled liquor not unlike vodka flavored with fruit and spices, and a frosty
Carlsberg beer. The hot smoked Arctic char on the main à la carte menu,
served with clams and bean purée in a mustard green broth, is also a
winner. Most fixed-price menus offer a well-chosen beverage accompani-
ment option.

Barbetta
$$$$
Midtown West
ITALIAN
The debate over what is New York’s oldest restaurant rages on, and Barbetta
(est. 1906), is in the thick of that debate. But there is no argument about
Barbetta’s sustained excellence during that period. The first and still one of
the few New York restaurants to serve cuisine from Piemonte, Italy’s north-
western-most region, Barbetta’s food, like its sumptuous décor, is richly ele-
gant. This is as far from your typical red-sauce joint as you’ll find. At
Barbetta, if you dine in the autumn or winter, you just might have the pleas-
ure of white truffles, flown in from Piemonte, and shaved over your already
decadent gnochetti ai formaggi, freshly-made, delicate gnocchi in an unfor-
gettable cheese sauce or the stunning creation of an edible quail’s nest filled
with fonduta cheese and surrounded by three tiny, speckled quail’s eggs.
You can choose from one of the restaurant’s 1906 creations like the bolliti
misti, a Piemontesi specialty, a mix of boiled meats and broth served from
an antique silver cart, but for a meal this unique, you must order 48-hours
in advance. Barbetta also features in the warmer months, one of the city’s
most romantic outdoor gardens. Though this is a theater-district restaurant

Becco
$$$
Midtown West
ITALIAN
If you’re a fan of Lidia’s Italian-American Kitchen on PBS, you’ll be happy to
know you can sample Lidia Bastianich’s simple, hearty Italian cooking
here. Becco, on Restaurant Row, is designed to serve her meals “at a dif-
ferent price point” (read: cheaper) than her East Side restaurant, Felidia.
The prices are not rock bottom, but in terms of service, portions, and qual-
ity, you get tremendous bang for your buck at Becco. The prix fixe menu
features a “Symphony of Pasta,” unlimited servings of the three fresh-made

daily pastas. An excellent selection of Italian wines is available at $25 a
bottle. If you can’t make up your mind about dessert, have them all: a tast-
ing plate includes gelato, cheesecake, and whatever else the dessert chef
has whipped up that day. Lidia herself does turn up at Becco and Felidia
regularly.

The Biltmore Room
$$$$
Chelsea
ASIAN FUSION
The name Biltmore Room conjures up a retro, noirish feel, but besides the
dazzling décor (much of it salvaged from the old Biltmore Hotel), there’s
nothing retro or noirish about the food here. You might want to start with
an original cocktail like “The Way of the Dragon,” with vodka, lime juice,
honey, mint, and a blast of hot pepper, and you know you’re onto some-
thing unique. Fiery is a good word to describe much of the cuisine, espe-
cially the Tataki of Blue Fin Tuna starter, with a tear-inducing cayenne
pepper oil that is balanced by cucumber ginger sorbet. For those who are
heat-shy, the crisp squash blossoms stuffed with crab in a mild mango chili
dipping sauce is a good option. The main dishes also display an Asian influ-
ence, especially the excellent Indian-spiced wild king salmon and the Thai-
marinated free-range chicken. For dessert, those passionate about chocolate
are not disappointed by the warm chocolate tort, while the passion fruit
souffle is worth the extra wait. Seating is not the most comfortable —
you’re close to your neighbors no matter where you’re seated — and the
room can get very cacophonous. Know that going in, and you can enjoy
the room’s visual splendor while dining on the chef’s innovatively tangy
creations.

BLT Fish
$$$$
Flatiron District
SEAFOOD
With the addition of the remarkable BLT Fish in 2005, chef/owner Laurent
Tourondel (BLT Steak, see p. 138, and BLT Prime) has created an eating
empire in Manhattan. This, his seafood branch of the empire, is actually
two restaurants with two distinct kitchens. The downstairs is a casual,
moderately-priced faux seafood shack with a raw bar, fried fare, and the
much in demand (deservedly so) lobster roll. Upstairs — you can walk the
steps or take a glass elevator — is the elegant (with prices to match) dining
room. Here you can sit under a skylight or near the open kitchen and
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in New York City 137

watch an army of servers move from the kitchen through the room with
huge platters topped with whole fish, which are dressed up beautifully and
ready for consumption. The crispy red snapper “Cantonese Style” is fil-
leted table side. But you have to crack the hard salt shell of the sea salt
crusted New Zealand pink snapper to get to the tender, juicy flesh under-
neath. You won’t go wrong with anything on the menu here. Like BLT Steak
and BLT Prime, don’t expect quiet conversation.

BLT Steak
$$$$$
Midtown East
STEAKHOUSE
Steakhouses are often stereotyped as bastions of male bonding, testos-
terone-fueled with red meat and hearty drinks. But BLT (Bistro Laurent
Tourendel) Steak breaks that mold in a big way; on the night I visited, I
noticed more women — slinky and model-like, chomping on thick cuts of
beef — than men. That doesn’t mean men can’t also enjoy the beef here.
It’s served in cast iron pots and finished in steak butter with a choice of
sauces — béarnaise, red wine, horseradish, and blue cheese, to name a
few. I recommend the New York strip or the succulent short ribs braised
in red wine. Both dishes can be shared, which may be a good idea, espe-
cially after devouring the airy complimentary popovers and sampling an
appetizer like the incredible tuna tartare or a side of onion rings. This is
not a restaurant for intimate conversation; even the music was muffled by
the cacophonous din of the diners.

Bread Tribeca
$$$
TriBeCa
NORTHERN ITALIAN
It’s about time a New York restaurant recognized the distinctive, seafood-
rich cuisine of Liguria. And even better that the restaurant is the very good
Bread Tribeca. Two staples of the region are done perfectly here: the fritto
misto, a mixture of fried fish such as calamari, cod, and mussels along with
wedges of vegetables, and zuppa de pesce, assorted seafood in a saffron-
tomato sauce. The homemade pastas, another trademark of Ligurian food,
are also excellent. Don’t miss the pansotti, ravioli-like dumplings served
with a walnut sauce, and the taglierini, a spaghetti-like pasta accompanied
by pesto with haricots verts and potatoes. A wood-burning oven turns out
excellent thin-crust pizzas and roasted meats. The breads are superb,
especially a baguette slathered with a remarkable sardine, tomato, and
peperoncino mixture. Most of the tables are communal so if the restaurant
Part III: Settling Into New York 
138

is crowded don’t expect intimacy. The 50-inch television above the bar is
often a distraction, not a complement, to the food.

Bubby’s Pie Company
$$
TriBeCa
AMERICAN
Brave the lines to get in, squeeze into one of the close tables, try to block
out the loud noise, and as soon as you begin to eat Bubby’s comfort food,
you immediately forget all that discomfort. Whether it’s the slow-cooked
pulled-pork barbecue; the magnificent, lighter than air meatloaf; or the but-
termilk fried half chicken, coupled with sides like collard greens, sautéed
spinach, macaroni and cheese, and baked beans, Bubby’s dishes define
comfort. Save room for the desserts, especially the homemade pies; one
taste of the chocolate peanut butter pie immediately brings on a flood of
happy childhood flashbacks. Breakfast is big here and lasts well into the
middle of the day. Brunch is a big thing in trendy TriBeCa and on week-
ends the waits can get very lengthy. Celebrities need comfort too, and you
may spot one or two at Bubby’s seeking anonymity and down-home chow.

Café des Artistes
$$$$$
Upper West Side
FRENCH
One of the oldest restaurants in Manhattan, Café des Artistes was estab-
lished in 1917, and with its gorgeous “wood nymph” murals painted in the
1930s, it’s still one of the most romantic restaurants in the city. The solid,
French country food served is very expensive, but this is a place to
splurge, to soak in not only the history but the romantic aura exuding from
those murals. You don’t find any fancy twists on French cooking here, and
if they appear on the menu, stick with the old favorites, such as the
starters like salmon five ways or snails; or entrees like Dover sole with
brown butter sauce, roasted duck, or the challengingly hearty stew pot au
feu, complete with marrow bone. For dessert, the chocolate bread pud-
ding is a treat, while the hot fudge Napoleon is truly, as described by my
waiter, a “killer.” The waiters here have been around the block a few times,
so service is refreshingly old school. The restaurant does a brisk, pre-
Lincoln Center business, so if you want intimacy and romance (the main
reason to come here), reserve before or after the rush.

Carmine’s
$$
Upper West Side
FAMILY-STYLE SOUTHERN ITALIAN
This fun, family-style Upper West Side institution will not let you go home
hungry. Portions are huge here, and though big often means bad, it doesn’t
at Carmine’s. Remarkably, the restaurant turns out better pasta and
entrees than most 20-table Italian restaurants. I’ve never had pasta here
that wasn’t al dente and the marinara sauce is as good as any I’ve had in
Manhattan. For starters, the daily salads are always fresh and the moun-
tainous platter of fried calamari perfectly tender. Rigatoni marinara and
ziti with broccoli are pasta standouts, and the best meat entrees include
veal parmigiana, broiled porterhouse steak, and the remarkable chicken
scarpariello (chicken pan broiled with a lemon-rosemary sauce). The
tiramisu is pie-size, thick and creamy, and bathed in Kahlúa and Marsala.
Order half of what you think you need. Don’t expect intimate conversation
here; in fact, ear plugs may be in order. Unless you come early, expect to
wait. Carmine’s also has an outlet in Times Square.

Celeste
$$
Upper West Side
ITALIAN
I’m wary of fancy, trendy Italian restaurants that can’t hold a candle to my
late nonna’s (Italian for “grandmother”) magnificently simple cooking. Tiny,
but charming, Celeste, however, dispels my wariness with some delicious
simple creations of its own. Celeste has a wood-burning pizza oven, which
churns out thin-crusted, simple-but-delicious pizzas. The “fritti” (fried)
course here is unique; the fritto misto de pesce (fried mixed seafood) is
delectable, but the fried zucchini blossoms (something my nonna did so
well), usually available in the summer and fall, are amazing. The fresh
pastas are better than the dried pasta; I never thought the fresh egg noo-
dles with cabbage, shrimp, and sheep’s cheese would work, but the com-
bination is delicious. Not on the menu but usually available are plates of
rare, artisanal Italian cheeses served with homemade jams. Though the
main courses are also good, stick with the pizzas, antipasto, frittis, and
pastas. For dessert, try the gelato; the pistachio was the best I’ve ever had
in New York. The restaurant has been “discovered,” so go early or late or
expect a wait.

Cendrillon features authentic, yet innovative Filipino food in a comfortable
setting with exposed brick, a skylight in the main dining room, and cozy
booths up front. How authentic? Try a shot of lambagong, also known as
coconut grappa. It’s a potent alcoholic drink distilled from the coconut
flower sap and blended with sugarcane sap — as far as I know, Cendrillon
is the only restaurant to carry this Filipino specialty. The drink will ignite
your appetite for the flavors to follow, like the amazing squash soup with
crab dumplings or the fresh lumpia (Asian vegetables covered in a purple
yam and rice wrapper) with tamarind and peanut sauce. Cendrillon’s
chicken adobo, chicken braised in a marinade of vinegar, soy, chilis, and
garlic renders the bird as tender and tasty as you could ever imagine while
Romy’s (the chef/owner) spareribs, marinated in rice wine and garlic,
rubbed with spices, and cooked in a Chinese smokehouse are as good as
any ribs I’ve had cooked in a Texas smokehouse. Save room for the exotic
desserts like the Buko pie, made with coconut and topped with vanilla
bean ice cream or the halo halo, a parfait stuffed with ice creams and sor-
bets with flavors like avocado, jackfruit, and purple yam.

’Cesca
$$$$
Upper West Side
ITALIAN COUNTRY
It’s not easy to describe the Italian food served in ’Cesca; it’s like nothing
many New Yorkers have experienced before. Where else have you had
roasted sardines paired with a “soft” egg? With a roaring wood-burning
oven used to roast everything from oysters to peppers, this place is as
rustic as it gets. Imagine yourself in an Italian farmhouse where you’re
served slow-cooked meats, like pork shank with the fat cooked off and the
meat falling from the bone or a hearty potato gnocchi with tender braised
duck. Try to save room for the equally interesting desserts, like honey goat
milk gelato or fresh figs with fig gelato. Service is friendly and informal,
and the restaurant is spacious and comfortable with a large bar area com-
plete with long tables where you snack on marinated olives, fritto misto, or
spicy parmigiana fritters while sipping unusual Italian wines. ’Cesca is one
of the most popular restaurants on the Upper West Side, so call well ahead

If you want the royal treatment as you dine on excellent and innovative
French cuisine, you can’t do better than Chanterelle. The dining room is
simple but beautiful, with a pressed-tin ceiling, widely spaced large tables,
comfortable chairs, and gorgeous floral displays; the restaurant also
boasts a superb modern art collection. Expect knowledgeable service;
your waiter will have no trouble answering any questions you have about
the menu. The seasonal menu changes every few weeks, but one signature
dish appears on almost every menu: a marvelous grilled seafood sausage.
Cheese lovers should opt for a cheese course — the presentation and

FRENCH/AMERICAN
Supervised by chef Geoffrey Zakarian, the chef of the popular and
acclaimed Town restaurant, it’s hard to believe that this stunningly ele-
gant, urbane restaurant in the recently renovated Hotel Carlton, could be
the country in Zakarian’s, Town/Country duo. There’s really nothing coun-
try about the place. And that’s not a knock. Gorgeously designed by archi-
tect, David Rockwell, the restaurant’s magnificent centerpiece is the
restored 200-sq.-ft. Tiffany skylight dome that was hidden over the years
by a dropped ceiling. Zakarian’s prix fixe menu, which changes every other
week, matches the décor’s sophisticated style. When I visited for an early
spring dinner, warm asparagus in a light lemon vinaigrette was an out-
standing first course option while the lamb cannelloni — tender pieces of

shredded lamb in a wanton-thin dumpling — made the perfect second
course accompaniment. Of the third course options, the striped bass with
crushed herbs, potatoes, and clams was the standout. A selection of
cheeses is offered as a dessert option and very hard to resist. Downstairs
is the more countrified, darker, wood-paneled, equally excellent Café at

Daniel
$$$$$
Upper East Side
FRENCH COUNTRY
Many reasons explain why Daniel (Daniel Boulud’s signature restaurant) is
a New York Times four-star winner: the luxurious décor, the comfortable
seating, the impeccable, white-gloved service — but the best reason is
Boulud’s faultless classic country French cooking. The menu is heavy with
game dishes in elegant but unfussy preparations, plus Daniel signatures
like black sea bass in a crisp potato shell, with tender leeks and a light
Syrah sauce. Excellent starters include foie gras terrine with fennel confit
and dried apricot compote, and rosemary and blood orange glazed endive.
Sublime entrees include spit-roasted and braised organic guinea hen with
black truffle butter, and chestnut-crusted venison with sweet potato purée.
But you can’t really go wrong with anything here. The wine list is terrific
and, divided between seasonal fruits and chocolates, the desserts are uni-
formly excellent. Tip: You can dine in the lounge and sample the same food
without the formality (jacket-and-tie for men is not enforced in the lounge).

FRENCH BISTRO
Compared to Daniel Boulud’s signature and formal restaurant Daniel (see
listing earlier in this chapter), db Bistro Moderne is as casual as a burger
joint. But casual means the models who dine here wear Armani T-shirts
while digging into burgers that cost $29. Okay, so it’s not your typical
coffee-shop burger. Boulud’s famous creation is made with minced sirloin,
foie gras, preserved black truffle, and braised short ribs on a Parmesan
onion roll. So casual may mean many things, but here it does not mean
cheap. Despite the silly burger excess, the food is, like all Boulud’s ven-
tures, outstanding — especially bistro favorites such as bouillabaisse, coq
au vin, and frogs’ legs.

INDIAN
In a city overpopulated with Indian restaurants, it takes a lot to stand out,
but Devi does just that. Devi offers $55 tasting menus (vegetarian and non-
vegetarian) and that’s really the way to go here. The menu features nine
small courses that will let you sample much of what the restaurant has to
offer. Some of the highlights include tender tandoori chicken stuffed with
spicy herbs, halibut coated in a cilantro rub and accompanied with mint
coconut chutney and lemon rice, zimikand koftas, delicate yam koftas in a
creamy tomato-onion sauce, and the addictive, crispy okra, the Indian
equivalent of french fries. With the tasting menus, you get a choice of
desserts; of them, I strongly recommend the fabulous falooda, an Indian
sundae that’s a refreshing combination of noodles with honey-soaked basil
seeds, mango, and strawberry sorbet in lemongrass-infused coconut milk.

and long-time friend of the Lurgis family, who have owned the restaurant
since 1959. Maybe you’ll get to sit in what was writer James Baldwin’s
favorite corner table; the restaurant is actually mentioned in his biogra-
phy, or one of the tables off the bar, possibly the one that a resident ghost
is rumored to occasionally inhabit. The menu here features the exact same
dishes brought from Spain that are now so familiar such as paella a la
Valenciana, shrimp al ajillo, and mariscada (mixed seafood) with green
sauce. Of course, all of this is complemented with El Faro’s particularly
potent signature sangria, also known as “truth serum.”

Flor de Mayo 
$
Upper West Side
CHINESE/CUBAN
Cuban/Chinese cuisine is a New York phenomenon that started in the late
1950s when Cubans of Chinese heritage immigrated to New York after the
revolution. Most of the immigrants took up residence on the Upper West
Side, and Cuban/Chinese restaurants flourished. Many have disappeared,
but the best one, Flor de Mayo, still remains and is so popular that a new
branch opened further south on Amsterdam Avenue. The kitchen excels at
both sides of the massive menu, but the best dish is the la brasa half-
chicken lunch special — beautifully spiced and slow-roasted until it’s fork
tender and falling off the bone, served with a giant pile of fried rice, boun-
teous with roast pork, shrimp, and veggies. Service and atmosphere are
reminiscent of Chinatown: efficient and lightning-quick.

One of the great, late-night dining spots in Manhattan, Florent (open nearly

close, Florent gets busy, and tables are tightly packed, almost uncomfort-
ably so in some cases. This place has a real sense of humor (check out the
menu boards above the bar) and a CD catalog full of the latest indie
sounds, all adding to the hipster fun. The food’s good, too; the grilled
chicken with herbs and mustard sauce is a moist and flavorful winner, as
is the French onion soup crowned with melted Gruyère. You can always
pick from diner faves like burgers and chili, in addition to Gallic standards

Frankie & Johnnie’s
$$$$
Midtown West
STEAKHOUSE
When a restaurant opens a new branch of its original, red flags immediately
go up. Does that mean the restaurant has immediately become a chain and
thus quality has eroded to chain food status? In the case of Frankie &
Johnnie’s, the legendary theater district former speakeasy turned steak-
house, which opened another outlet in 2005, in the two-story townhouse
owned once by actor John Barrymore, those fears were quickly allayed
after one bite of their signature sirloin. Not only are Frankie & Johnnie’s
steaks vastly underrated in the competitive world of New York steakhouses,
but the other non-steak options are superb as well. The crab cake appe-
tizer has an overwhelmingly high crab to cake ratio — and that’s a good
thing — while the sides of hash browns are the best I’ve had. Service is
steakhouse old school and if you are staying in midtown, the restaurant
provides complimentary stretch limo service to and from the restaurant.

The Lower East Side was once the home to many Kosher wine factories,

ness and their delicacy with the coppa (a spicy cured ham) with hot pep-
pers and rucola (arugula) being the standout. The “tramezzini,” a crustless
sandwich is nothing like the crustless sandwiches served at high tea. Here,
among other things, you can have yours stuffed with tuna and chickpeas
or with pollo alla diavola, spicy shredded pieces of dark meat chicken. The
“Fritto” section of the menu includes a wonderful mozzarella in corroza,
breaded mozzarella stuffed with a juicy anchovy sauce and lightly fried.

STEAKHOUSE
One of the oldest steakhouses in New York, Keen’s, established in 1885,
not only serves the basics of a steakhouse — porterhouse for two, T-bone,
and filet mignon with the requisite sides like creamed spinach and hash
browns — but they serve chops: lamb chops, prime rib, short ribs, and
most notably, mutton chops. It is the mutton chop, with its two flaps of
long, thick, rich subtly gamy meat on either side of the bone, that has
made Keen’s the true original that it is. Keen’s is no gussied up remake of
old New York. It’s the real thing. Its authenticity shows in everything from
the thousands of ceramic pipes on the ceiling (regular diners, including
celebrities like Babe Ruth, George M. Cohan, and Albert Einstein, were
given their own personal pipes) to the series of wood-paneled rooms
(some with fireplaces), leather banquettes, a clubby bar with a three-page
menu of single malts, and even the framed playbill Lincoln was reading at
the Ford Theater that infamous evening in 1865.

Provençal, Dijonnaise, or the comforting blend of shallots, parsley, and
white wine. Steaks and chops are cooked over an open fire and the steaks

Since it first opened in late 1999, this Roman-style osteria has remained a
hot ticket. Lupa is blessed with an impeccable pedigree: Among its owners
is Mario Batali, the Food TV “Iron Chef” who has built a miniempire in the
Manhattan restaurant world. It offers high-quality food at good value —
you can eat very well here and not have to max out your credit card. The
food is consistently tasty — but don’t expect big portions. That’s part of
the secret to the good value, but don’t worry — you won’t starve. The
menu is thoughtful and creative, focusing on lusty Roman fare like ricotta
gnocchi with sausage and fennel, or pork saltimbocca. Wines, too, have
been thoughtfully chosen, and you can order a bottle from the extensive
list or sample one of several varieties that come in a carafe. Here, perhaps
more than at any other Batali enterprise, the service hits just the right
notes: Servers are both warm and supremely knowledgeable. Make a reser-
vation, or go early to snag one of the tables set aside for walk-ins.

When you think of Korean food, you probably think of barbecue at your

In the heart of New York’s Koreatown, find the two women in the window
lovingly rolling and stuffing fresh mandoo and you know you’ve arrived.
Because of the constant preparation, the dumplings are incredibly fresh
and stuffed with a variety of ingredients. The restaurant offers many
options, including Mool Mandoo (the basic white dumpling filled with pork
and vegetables), Kimchee Mandoo (steamed dumplings with potent kim-
chee, Korean spiced cabbage, tofu, pork, and vegetables), and Goon
Mandoo (a pan-fried dumpling filled with pork and vegetables). You really
can’t go wrong with any of these, so sample them all with a Combo
Mandoo. Soups are also special here; try the beef noodle in a spicy, sinus-
clearing broth. The seats are nothing more than wooden benches here, so
Mandoo Bar is more suited for quick eats rather than a lingering meal. This
makes it perfect for nearby Empire State Building touring and/or shopping

Maremma

ITALIAN/WESTERN
Maremma is the name of the rocky, rough coastal region of Tuscany where
Italian cowboys roam the land and the menu at Maremma is the unlikely
mix of Tuscan and cowboy cuisine. Here you’ll find small plates on the
menu like the spin on the traditional sloppy joe called “sloppy Giuseppe”:
tender pieces of shredded beef over thick-crusted Tuscan bread, or the
“bordatino di mare,” sticks of fried seafood with a crispy polenta crust
served with spicy “Tuscan ketchup.” The addition of chocolate to the wild
boar ragu that covers the fresh pappardelle is a nod to the west, while a
touch of bourbon westernizes the tomato and grana padano sauce served
over artisanal pasta. The Tuscan fries, traditional french fries but with
herbs and garlic sprinkled on them, are an addictive revelation. Not only
is Maremma the only Italian/Western restaurant in New York, it is also
probably the only restaurant in New York that serves Rocky Mountain oys-
ters (also known as bull’s testicles). Are you cowboy enough to try them?

enclosed wine cellar is visible from the small dining room, the restaurant
stays open very late, and you’ll find hipsters in jeans and t-shirts as well
as suits eating here. The combination of urban and rural, along with the
creative menu, makes Mas so special. The dishes are innovative, the ingre-
dients are fresh — many of them are supplied from upstate New York
farms. The tender, perfectly prepared, braised pork belly is served with
polenta and a stew of escargot and lima beans, and the duck breast melds
magically with apple purée, sautéed Brussels sprouts, and chestnuts.
Service is low key, but attentive, and seating, though somewhat cramped,
is not so bad that it dims the romantic aura of the restaurant.

Molyvos serves some of the best simple, unpretentious traditional Greek

ment of familiar appetizers like the spreads tzatziki, melitzanosalata, and
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in New York City 149

taramosalata, and a terrific vegetable dolmades, grape leaves filled with
rice, raisins, and pine nuts. Move on to a sampling of hot mezedes like
spinach pie or an appetizer of grilled octopus. I often daydream about
Molyvos’s traditional entrees, like rabbit stifado (a rabbit stew that tastes

New York Noodletown 
$
Chinatown
CHINESE
So what if the restaurant has all the ambience of a school cafeteria? I’m wary
of an over-adorned dining room in Chinatown; the simpler the better I say.
And New York Noodletown is simple, but the food is the real thing. Seafood-
based noodle soups are spectacular as is the platter of chopped roast pork.
Those two items alone would make me very happy. But I’m greedy and
wouldn’t leave the restaurant without one of its perfectly prepared shrimp
dishes, especially the salt-baked shrimp. If you’re lucky and your hotel has
a good-size refrigerator, take the leftovers home — they’ll make a great snack
the next day. New York Noodletown keeps very long hours, which makes it
one of the best late-night bets in the neighborhood, too.

Noche Mexicana

Upper West Side
MEXICAN
This tiny Mexican restaurant serves some of the best tamales in New York.
Wrapped in cornhusks, as a good tamale should be, they come in two vari-
eties: in a red mole sauce with shredded chicken or in a green tomatillo
sauce with shredded pork. Each order contains three tamales and costs
between $4 and $6, making it a cheap and almost perfect lunch. The bur-
ritos are authentic and meals unto themselves. The tinga burrito, shred-
ded chicken in a tomato-and-onion chipotle sauce, is my favorite. Each is
stuffed with rice, beans, and guacamole. Don’t get fancy here; stick with
the tamales, burritos, and soft tacos, the best being the taco al pastor, a
taco stuffed with pork marinated with pineapple and onions.

ITALIAN
Nonna (Italian for grandmother) carries on the Italian grandmother tradi-
tion more than admirably, with excellent traditional pastas and main
courses. On the menu, you’ll find excellent spaghetti carbonara (made the
right way: without cream); spaghetti and meatballs, with an exceptional
meatball; pasta fagioli; linguine with clams; pork braciole; sausage and
peppers; and antipasti items like Sicilian caponata, homemade mozzarella,
and spicy cherry peppers stuffed with prosciutto and provolone. Specials
are offered daily. Friday is lobster fra diavolo, Tuesday is lasagna, but the
best day, of course, is Sunday, when “Nonna’s Sunday Feast” is offered: six
courses including rigatoni with a “Brooklyn meat gravy,” the Italian-
American translation meaning meat-based tomato sauce. You think you’ve

MALAYSIAN
One of the few Malaysian restaurants in Manhattan (and also one of the
best) is Chinatown’s Nyonya. This spacious, bustling restaurant designed
like a South Asian tiki hut offers efficient and friendly service, but the huge
portions of exotic, spicy food are the real treat. Coconut milk–, curry–, and
chile pepper–laden dishes are staples of Malaysian cuisine, and they’re
the norm at Nyonya. The Malaysian national dish, roti canai (an Indian pan-
cake with a curry chicken dipping sauce), is outstanding. The noodle
soups are meals in themselves; prawn mee (egg noodles, shredded pork,
large shrimp in a spicy shrimp broth) is sinus-clearing, and the curry spare
ribs are nothing short of spectacular. Even the drinks and desserts are
exotic, including sooi pooi drink (sour plum) and pulut hitam dessert
(creamy black glutinous rice with coconut milk). But vegetarians beware:
The menu doesn’t hold much for you here; most dishes are prepared in
either a meat or fish broth.

SEAFOOD
When you enter Oceana, the nautical themes are obvious. But this is no

and horseradish sorbet; striped bass wrapped in a ham croissant; and
stuffed artichoke and Icelandic cod basted in butter and herbs. His dishes
look so good on the plate you might not want to eat them, but that would
be a big mistake. In this case the artwork is extremely edible. Oceana also
features an excellent wine list and your waiter will help pair wines with
your dishes if you desire. Though this is not your everyday restaurant —

The Odeon

TriBeCa
AMERICAN BRASSERIE
For over two decades the Odeon has been a symbol of the TriBeCa 
sensibility. In fact, the restaurant can claim credit for the neighborhood’s
cachet — it was the first to lure artists, actors, writers, and models to the
area below Canal Street before it was given its moniker. Why did they
come? They came to drink, to schmooze, and to enjoy the hearty no-frills
brasserie grub like the still-splendid country frisee salad with bacon,
Roquefort cheese, and pear vinaigrette; the truffled poached egg; grilled
skirt steak; moules frites (mussels with fries); and sautéed cod. Though the
restaurant has not always been the celebrity magnet it was in its heyday
of the 1980s, the food, drink, and that inviting, open, deco-ish room has
withstood the test of time and has surpassed trendy to now claim well-
deserved New York establishment status.

Upper West Side
GREEK
This is not your father’s Greek restaurant. This is serious, innovative Greek-
influenced cuisine. Here, in a cozy Upper West Side townhouse, you’ll find
nods to authentic Greek country food as evidenced by the challenging “Offal
Tasting Menu.” For those of you who dare, there is the jellied “head cheese”
of pork, the grilled kidneys, and the braised tongue. But for all us other less-
adventurous diners, we just have to resort to the fresh and delicate raw
“meze” like sea urchin with beets and Greek cheese fondue, yellowtail with
cracked green olives, and lamb with arugula and feta cheese. Or a cooked
appetizer of chilled roasted octopus drizzled with an anchovy vinaigrette.
Some of the exciting entree creations include the pork two ways, grilled ten-
derloin and braised belly, the pan-seared John Dory with a crab orzo salad,
or the pasta called Manti, a four-cheese ravioli in a sage brown butter sauce.

CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN
When chef/restaurateur Tom Valenti opened Ouest in 2002 it signaled a
very welcome renaissance in the Upper West Side dining scene. And Ouest
still remains the neighborhood’s shining star. With plush red banquettes
and an intimate balcony area, Ouest is both cozy and clubby. Service is
personable but also efficiently professional. But what really draws the
crowds is Valenti’s mastery in the kitchen, especially with meats like his
signature braised lamb shank or his melt-in-your-mouth braised beef short
ribs. The quality suffers not one iota when you switch to seafood. The
sautéed skate is perfectly prepared with a simple sauce of parsley and
olive oil, while the baby calamari in a spicy tomato sopressata sauce appe-
tizer was so good I actually smiled as I ate. The desserts, including dense
chocolate cake and a variety of sorbets, are excellent.

Pampano
$$$$
Midtown East
MEXICAN SEAFOOD
Because I usually prefer my Mexican food simple and cheap, good expen-
sive Mexican food is, in my mind, a contradiction in terms. Pampano, how-
ever, and the things it does with Mexican ingredients, especially seafood,
has made me reconsider my bias. Set in a lovely, lush townhouse, seating
here is much more comfortable than I’m used to, which is a bonus. But
even if I were seated on a hard bench, the ceviche here would taste spec-
tacular. For a rare and very special treat, try a lobster taco — you won’t
find that at your local taqueria. Of the entrees, it’s difficult to order any-
thing but the fantastic pampano adobado, sautéed pompano with creamy
black rice, roasted garlic, and chile guajillo sauce; but you won’t suffer too
much if you settle for the very memorable pan-fried baby red snapper in
a chile de arbol sauce. Save room for chocolate flan for dessert and maybe
a cleansing shot of one of the restaurant’s many excellent tequilas.

Paola’s

Upper East Side
ITALIAN
There is no shortage of Italian restaurants on the Upper East Side, but
strength is not always in numbers and many are mediocre at best. There
is nothing, however, mediocre about Paola’s, and having survived and
thrived in the neighborhood for over ten years is testament to the restau-
rant’s quality and charms. The two dining rooms are comforting and invit-
ing, the larger centered around a wood-burning oven used to cook many
of the restaurant’s meat dishes, the other the smaller, but cozy, wine room.
Most appealing of all is the menu. Pastas are usually homemade; the pap-
pardelle with a rich duck meat ragu is a standout while the hand-rolled
trofie served with pesto is a Paola’s specialty. The stinco d’agnello, slow
roasted lamb shank with sage and parmesan polenta, is a hearty main
course. Or try something roasted in the wood-burning oven like the natu-
rally raised, corn fed poussins, served with potato gratin and sautéed
greens. Fig ice cream topped with port-soaked figs is the decadent way to
finish your meal.

first-rate cuts — the only ones this 113-year-old institution serves — are
dry-aged on the premises and come off the grill dripping with fat and
butter, crusty on the outside and pink within. If you really want to be fool-
ish, you can order sole or lamb chops, but why bother? The $5.95 Peter
Luger burger, however, served only at lunch, is a little-known treasure. As
sides go, the German fried potatoes are crisp and delicious, and the
creamed spinach is everything it should be.

among them is Pho Viet Huong. The menu is vast here and needs intense
perusing, but your waiter will gladly help you pare it down. The Vietnamese
know soup and pho, a beef-based soup is the most famous, but the hot and
sour canh soup, with either shrimp or fish, is the real deal. The small is
more than enough for two to share while the large is more than enough for
a large family. The odd pairing of barbecued beef wrapped in grape leaves
is another of the restaurant’s specialties and should not be missed. The
bun, various meats and vegetables served over rice vermicelli, are simple,
hearty, and incredibly inexpensive. You’ll also find Vietnamese sandwiches
here; French bread filled with ham, chicken, eggs, lamb, and even pâté. All
of the above is best washed down with an icy cold Saigon beer.

BARBECUE
RUB is short for Righteous Urban Barbecue — a cool name and after tast-
ing some of the barbecue that comes out of the restaurant’s custom-made,
New York City Health Department–approved smoker, righteous is an apt
description. The smoked turkey and barbecued chicken were the best I’ve
had; moist inside with a distinctive smoked flavor, and the ribs, St.
Louis–style, were delicate and crispy, yet tender and meaty. The “burnt
ends,” the fatty part of the brisket, however, were a bit tough. The best
way to get a taste of all of RUB’s barbecue is to order the humongous
“Taste of the Baron” — a little of everything is piled high on a platter. The
restaurant is cramped and loud and the prices are urban (meaning high),
but the food at RUB will provide all the comfort you need.

Porcao
$$$$
Flatiron District
BRAZILIAN STEAKHOUSE
If you decide to dine at Porcao, make sure you not only bring a hefty
appetite, but also a serious craving for meat, red in particular. Porcao
serves in the rodizio style, a Rio-originated style in which waiters roam
from table to table serving hot, juice-dripping meat cooked “churrasco”
style (cooked upright, on a skewer, over hot coals) straight from the skew-
ers. There is no menu at Porcao; you pay one price for all you can eat.
Choices include ten varieties of meats, a rolling tray of salmon, sides liked
fried yucca and fried banana, and a full salad bar. Turn your pig chip up to
the green side and the waiters will arrive at your table ready to serve.
Before you have a chance to sample the meat, possibly the tender, juicy,
picanha (top sirloin) or the equally delicious alcatra (similar to pot roast),
another waiter will arrive to serve you something else. To slow the
process, turn your chip to red, and the waiters will halt until you are ready
for more. If you get thirsty, try a caipirinha, a Brazilian specialty drink
made with lime and cachaca (sugar cane liquor).

I am usually very wary of “fusion” cuisine, but in Sapa’s case, the combi-

histories is a natural one. Begin your journey in the Mediterranean with a
spectacular salad of romaine hearts, endive, and Taleggio cheese with pear
fritters in a pear vinaigrette. Move quickly to Vietnam and sample one or
two rolls prepared at Sapa’s “roll bar;” the spiced yellowfin tartare with
avocado and green papaya sprouts was my favorite. When it comes to the
main courses, the ginger-crusted ahi tuna over braised oxtail is the signa-
ture dish. The restaurant is cavernous, with high ceilings and bright white
walls, and service is extremely personable and knowledgeable. The dining
experience at Sapa is exotic on every level — even the restroom area, with
its candle-adorned bubbling pool, Chinese screens decorating the row of
bathroom doors, and soft music, is worth the trip even if you don’t have
to go.

home-cured gravlax, here served over a chickpea-scallion pancake in a
flying-fish caviar and dill sauce; the grilled calamari; the mixed seafood filo
purse; and the perfectly cooked hangar steak over egg noodles. For
dessert don’t miss the tarte tatine, a homemade apple tart served with cin-
namon ice cream and warm honey. In warm weather, the sidewalk cafe is
a great place for people-watching.

Family-friendly restaurants
Although it’s always smart to call ahead to make sure a restaurant has kids’ menus
and high chairs, you can count on the following restaurants to be especially accom-
modating (and find more info on each restaurant from the alphabetical list in this chap-
ter). You and the kids may consider Florent or Artie’s Delicatessen. And don’t forget
pizzerias — John’s Pizzeria and Lombardi’s especially.
Choose from some of these other great options for the whole family:
 Bubby’s: Even the pickiest kid can find something on this menu.
 Carmine’s: This rollicking, family-style Italian restaurant was created with kids in
mind. You won’t have to worry about them making too much noise here.

and great desserts.
 Mickey Mantle’s (42 Central Park South, between Fifth and Sixth avenues,

graph hounds and children, but he more than made up for it in retirement when he
opened his extremely kid-friendly restaurant, located just across the street from
Central Park. (See the “Midtown Dining” map.)
 Serendipity 3: Kids love this whimsical restaurant and ice-cream shop, which
serves up a huge menu of American favorites, followed by colossal ice-cream
treats.
 Tavern on the Green (Central Park West and W. 67th Street, % 212-873-3200): Your
kids will be wowed by the Central Park setting. What’s more, if the little ones get
rambunctious, you can just take them outdoors to blow off a little steam. (See the
“Uptown Dining” map.)
 Virgil’s Real BBQ: This raucous Times Square barbecue joint is possibly one of
the loudest restaurants in New York, so the kids will fit right in.

For enormous portions of perfectly charred and seasoned red meat in a
burlesquelike setting (complete with semi-nude, old-time stripper photos,
which adorn the red velvet walls, roomy burgundy banquettes, and a
steady flow of lounge music), visit the appropriately named Strip House.
As soon as one of those steaks lands on your table, the semi-nudes quickly
take a backseat to the enjoyable task in front of you: devouring that meat.
The signature strip steak still brings back fond memories, and you really
can’t go wrong with either the filet mignon or the porterhouse for two,
carved at your table. The sides here are innovative variations on the stan-
dards: creamed spinach with black truffles, French fries with herbs and
garlic, and, best of all, the crisp goose fat potatoes. They sound scary, but
they’re worth the indulgence. Desserts are monumental — especially the
multi-layered chocolate cake — so have your waiter bring extra forks for
sharing. With the exception of those few previously mentioned banquettes,
seating is tight so don’t expect intimacy.

Tamarind
$$$
Flatiron District
INDIAN
Inexpensive Indian restaurants, like inexpensive Mexican restaurants,
abound in Manhattan so much so that it’s often not worth splurging on a
more upscale restaurant when you can get the same quality food at a
cheaper price. In Tamarind’s case, innovative and flavorful variations on
the old standards served flawlessly in a sleek, gallerylike setting make the
splurge most definitely worth it. Adjacent to the bar is a glassed-in cubicle
where you can watch the chefs work the tandoor ovens. Just about any-
thing that comes out of those ovens is spectacular. The incredible breads,
Bhel Poori, and the assorted crisps and noodles with sweet and sour chut-
neys make great starters, especially when accompanied by an Indian beer.
But try not fill up on the bread and starters and save room for entrees like
the Jhinga Angarey (jumbo prawns marinated in yogurt and chiles). If you
venture from the tandoor, try the lamb pasanda (apricot-filled grilled lamb
in a cashew and saffron sauce) or Tamarind swordfish marinated in
tamarind chutney and fenugreek leaves. You can also choose from a
number of vegetarian options here; the Raji vegetarian Thali, an assort-

Like so many other steakhouses, Uncle Jack’s is testosterone-fueled.
Portions are monstrous, décor is plush and bawdy with huge banquettes, it
boasts a lively bar with a large variety of single malt scotches, and two pri-
vate party rooms with helpful tuxedoed waiters are available. But don’t let
all that “manliness” deter you from enjoying the excellent cuts of meat.
Steaks are dry-aged for 21 days, and that seems perfect for the tender 28-
ounce T-bone, big enough for two big men. The 48-ounce porterhouse, Uncle
Jack’s signature dish, is large enough for a family. The restaurant also fea-
tures chops; the thick-cut pork chop marinated for 24 hours in Jack Daniels
holds its own against the steak and seafood. And the baked clams appetizer
is as good as I’ve had at many Italian restaurants. Desserts are, of course,
mammoth, but find room to at least share the spectacular pecan pie.

$37–$75; most steaks: $37. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V. Open: Mon–Sat noon–midnight.
Virgil’s Real BBQ
$$$
Midtown West
BARBECUE/SOUTHERN
The pickings are slim in Times Square for decent, value-priced food, so my
suggestion for the best bet in the immediate area is Virgil’s. The “theme” is
Southern barbecue, and the restaurant, sprawling with dining on two levels,
is made to look and feel like a Southern roadhouse with good ole boy deco-
rations on the walls and blues on the soundtrack. But forget the gussied-up
theme stuff and enjoy the surprisingly authentic smoked meats, especially
the spice-rubbed ribs, which are slow cooked and meaty. Or you can try the
smoked slices of Owensboro lamb or the Texas beef brisket. For starters,
the corn dogs with poblano mustard are something New Yorkers rarely have
the pleasure of experiencing, and the barbecue nachos — tortilla chips
slathered with melted cheese and barbecued pulled pork — are a meal in
themselves. Desserts are what you would expect from a restaurant emulat-
ing a Southern theme: big and sweet. Try the homemade ice cream sand-
wich made with the “cookie of the day.” Virgil’s is a great place to bring the
kids; they can make as much noise as they want here and no one will notice.
See map p. 132. 152 W. 44th St. (between Sixth and Seventh avenues). % 212-921-
9494. www.virgilsbbq.com. Reservations recommended. Subway: 1, 2, 3, 7, 9, N,
R to 42nd Street/Times Square. Sandwiches: $6–$11; main courses and barbecue
platters: $13–$26. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V. Open: Sun–Mon 11:30 a.m.–11 p.m., Tues–Sat
11:30 a.m.–midnight.

Wondee Siam 
$
Midtown West
THAI
Hell’s Kitchen offers countless ethnic culinary variations and one of the
most prevalent is Thai — there are at least six in a 5-block radius. My favorite
among these is the tiny, zero-ambience Wondee Siam. I don’t need colorful
decorations or a big fish tank to enjoy authentic, uncompromisingly spicy
Thai food and that’s what I get at Wondee Siam. Here you don’t have to
worry that your waiter will assume you want a milder form of Thai. If a little
red asterisk appears next to your item, you can be sure it is appropriately
spicy. The soups are terrific, especially the sinus-clearing Tom Yum. In fact,
a whole section of Yum (chilis) dishes is on the menu; my favorite being the
Larb Gai, minced ground chicken with ground toasted rice. The curries are
also first rate as are the noodles, including the mild pad Thai. This is strictly
BYOB and you’ll want to do so to complement the spicy food. 
See map p. 132. 792 Ninth Ave. (between 52nd and 53rd streets). % 212-459-9057.
Reservations not accepted. Subway: C, E to 50th Street. Main courses: $7.50–$18 (most
under $10). No credit cards. Open: Mon–Sat 11 a.m.–11 p.m., Sun 11 a.m.–10:30 p.m. 
Dining and Snacking on the Go
New York is a city where everyone is constantly on the move. The pace
feels like you have just 15 minutes before your curtain goes up, the game
begins, or the tour starts. More often than not, you don’t have time to sit
down to a leisurely dinner. We’re well aware of the rush here in New
York, which is why you can find so many quick and tasty eats.
Breakfast
I’m going to be honest: I think brunch is for suckers. I mean, what is it
but a slightly fancier version of breakfast at inflated prices — and it’s
usually not served until after 11 a.m. . . . and only on weekends! Talk
about scams. I’ll take breakfast over brunch any day — especially on
weekends. Some of my favorite restaurants for breakfast — not to be
confused with brunch — include:
 Big Wong King, 67 Mott St. between Canal and Bayard streets
(% 212-964-1452). No eggs. No coffee. No pancakes. Can this be
breakfast? You bet it can. Not much is more satisfying in the morn-
ing than a hot bowl of congee (rice porridge with either pork, beef,
or shrimp), accompanied by a fried cruller and tea served in a glass.
Big Wong is a breakfast favorite among the residents of Chinatown.
Opens daily at 8:30 a.m. (See the “Downtown Dining” map.)
 Clinton St. Baking Company, 4 Clinton St. at Houston Street 
(% 646-602-6263). The blueberry pancakes with maple butter and
the buttermilk biscuit egg sandwich are worth braving the morning
lines. Or wait until the lines subside and have them for lunch and
dinner — they’re served all day. Opens at 8 a.m. daily. (See the
“Downtown Dining” map.)
Part III: Settling Into New York 
160

 Good Enough to Eat, 483 Amsterdam Ave. between 83rd and 84th
streets (% 212-496-0163). Waiting on line for breakfast is another of
my pet peeves, and the wait for breakfast at this Upper West Side
institution on the weekends is ridiculous and should be avoided. So
go during the week when you can gorge on pumpkin French toast, a
“Wall Street” omelet, baked honey-mustard glazed ham with Vermont
cheddar, or “Peter Paul” pancakes filled with Belgian chocolate
chips, coconut, and topped with roasted coconut. Opens weekdays
at 8 a.m., weekends at 9 a.m. (See the “Uptown Dining” map.)
 Norma’s, at Le Parker Meridien hotel, 118 W. 57th St. between Sixth
and Seventh avenues (% 212-708-7460). Norma’s is a glorious ode
to comfort food. It’s pricey but worth it for classics done with style
and creativity. Open weekdays at 6:30 a.m., weekends at 7 a.m. (See
the “Midtown Dining” map.)
 Veselka, 144 Second Ave. at 9th Street (% 212-228-9682). The
Greek diner may be extinct in Manhattan, but this Ukrainian diner
lives on. And we’re all very grateful, because New York just would
not be the same without Veselka’s buckwheat pancakes and cheese
blintzes. Open 24 hours. (See the “Downtown Dining” map.)
Bagels
We take our bagels seriously here in New York, and I admit to being a
bagel snob. I like mine moist, not too big, and without too much adorn-
ment. Here, in my estimation, is a list of places to find New York’s best
bagels, which, of course, are the world’s best:
 Absolute Bagels, 2708 Broadway between 107th and 108th streets
(% 212-932-2105). Their egg bagels, hot out of the oven, are per-
fectly-sized and melt in your mouth. (See the “Uptown Dining” map.)
 Ess-A-Bagel, 359 First Ave. at 21st Street (% 212-260-2252; www.
ess-a-bagel.com) and 831 Third Ave. between 50th and 51st
streets (% 212-980-1010). These are a little too hefty for my taste,
but they have a very loyal following, so I must acknowledge Ess-a-
Bagel’s worthiness. (See the “Midtown Dining” map.)
 H&H Bagels, 2239 Broadway at 80th Street (% 212-595-8003; www.
handhbagel.com) and 639 W. 46th St. at 12th Avenue (% 212-595-
8000). For years my undisputed favorite bagel, but in their arro-
gance, they raised their prices to $1 per bagel, and, as is usually the
case, the quality declined as well. But it’s still an excellent bagel.
Takeout only. (See the “Uptown Dining” map.)
 Murray’s Bagels, 500 Sixth Ave. between 12th and 13th streets 
(% 212-462-2830) and 242 Eighth Ave. at 23rd Street (% 646-638-
1334). There’s nothing like a soft, warm bagel to begin your day,
and Murray’s does them beautifully. (See the “Downtown Dining”
and “Midtown Dining” maps.)
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in New York City 161

Pizza
Hear this Chicago: Your deep-dish pizza abominations have nothing on
the delectable thin-crusted New York variety. And even though the quality
of pizza in the city — due to the very troubling proliferation of Domino’s,
Pizza Hut, and other fast-food pizza chains — has noticeably declined, this
is still where you can find the best pizza anywhere west of Italy.
So when pizza is what you seek, search out the real deal and don’t be
tempted by the sad, soggy imitations that seem to litter every block. You
can find the best pizza in the city at:
 Grimaldi’s Pizza, 19 Old Fulton St. between Front and Water streets
(% 718-858-4300). At the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge in Brooklyn,
the pizza made by the Grimaldis, who have made pizzas in New
York for almost 100 years, is cooked in a coal-oven and features a
crisp, thin crust; homemade mozzarella; and a rich, flavorful sauce.
If you need incentive to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge, Grimaldi’s
is it. (See the “Brooklyn Dining” map.)
 John’s Pizzeria, 278 Bleecker St. near Seventh Avenue South 
(% 212-243-1680), 260 W. 44th St. between Broadway and Eighth
Avenue (% 212-391-1560), and 408 E. 64th Street, at First Avenue
% 212-935-2895. Thanks to recent expansion, you can now choose
from one of three John’s locations in Manhattan. The quality has
been diluted somewhat, but not enough to skip this favorite. Thin-
crusted and out of a coal oven with the proper ratio of tomato
sauce to cheese, John’s is worthy of its loyal following. The original
Bleecker Street location is the most old-world romantic and my per-
sonal favorite. (See the “Downtown Dining” and “Midtown Dining”
maps.)
 Lombardi’s, 32 Spring St. between Mulberry and Mott streets 
(% 212-941-7994). Claiming to be New York’s oldest pizzeria (circa
1905), Lombardi’s still uses a generations-old Neapolitan family
pizza recipe. The coal-oven kicks out perfectly cooked pies, some
topped with ingredients such as pancetta, homemade sausage, and
my favorite, fresh-shucked clams. A garden in the back makes
Lombardi’s even more inviting during warm weather. (See the
“Downtown Dining” map.)
 Patsy’s Pizzeria, 2287 First Ave. between 117th and 118th streets
(% 212-534-9783). The coal oven here has been burning since
1932, and although the neighborhood in East Harlem where Patsy’s
is located has had its ups and downs, the quality of pizza at this
place has never wavered. Try the marinara pizza: a pie with fresh
marinara sauce, but no cheese (the pie is so good that you won’t
miss the mozzarella). Unlike at the other pizzerias mentioned here,
you can order by the slice at Patsy’s. 
With the exception of Patsy’s, most of the pizzerias I’ve listed are not the
place to go for a quick slice. Unfortunately, it’s tough to find a good
Part III: Settling Into New York 
162

“slice” of pizza anywhere in New York. If a slice is all you want, a few of
my top choices include:
 Sal & Carmine’s, 2671 Broadway between 100th and 101st streets.
(See the “Uptown Dining” map.)
 Joe’s Pizza, 7 Carmine St. at Sixth Avenue. (See the “Downtown
Dining” map.)
 Two Boots, 42 Avenue A between 3rd and 4th streets, and four
other Manhattan locations.
Hamburgers and hot dogs
While most of the country in the 1960s and ’70s was being inundated
with Golden Arches every few miles, New York proudly held out. But
then in the 1980s, the arches came, and now, just like everywhere else 
in the world, the Golden Arches are here to stay. But that doesn’t mean
that you should settle for what’s conveniently familiar when you can 
find so many better, and even cheaper, options that aren’t affiliated with
national fast-food chains. Instead, check out any of New York’s best
burger joints listed below:
 Big Nick’s Burger Joint, 2175 Broadway at 77th Street (% 212-
362-9238). Be careful you don’t get singed as you enter Big Nick’s,
where the griddle is perilously close to the entrance and burgers
are always frying. Trying to decide whether you want your burger
with buffalo meat, turkey, or ground beef is one problem; the
other is what you want on it, because at Big Nick’s, the options
are dizzying.
 Burger Joint, in the Le Parker Meridien Hotel, 118 W. 57th St.
between Sixth and Seventh avenues (% 212-245-5000). This clever
addition to the Le Parker Meridien Hotel is hidden off the lobby by
a red curtain, but word has spread about the perfect $4.50 ham-
burgers sold at this real joint where it’s just burgers, fries, and beer.
(See the “Midtown Dining” map.)
 New York Burger Co., 303 Park Ave. South, between 23rd and 24th
streets (% 212-254-2727), and 678 Sixth Ave., between 21st and
22nd streets (% 212-229-1404). You won’t feel guilty as you devour
the burgers at this “healthy” fast-food alternative. The beef is all-
natural, Coleman beef devoid of added hormones or antibiotics and
served on a fresh baked brioche bun. If that sounds too sterile for
you, it’s really not. The burgers have plenty of flavor and are
offered with a variety of toppings and sides. 
 P.J. Clarke’s, 915 Third Ave., at 55th Street, (% 212-317-1616;
www.pjclarkes.com). P.J. Clarke’s has been a midtown institution
for over 50 years and Clarke’s hamburger, like the restaurant’s old
wood walls, the broken telephone booth, and the hidden dining
nook for two, has been blessedly preserved. Nothing more than a
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in New York City 163

slab of chopped meat cooked to order, on a bun and for the curious
price of $8.10, the hamburger is a simple masterpiece. 
 Rare Bar & Grill, 303 Lexington Ave., between 37th and 38th
streets, (% 212-481-1999). You might pay a little more for your
burger at Rare Bar & Grill — they range from $13 to $18 — but you
are paying for eight ounces of Grade A American chuck beef that is
ground daily at the restaurant. Rare has a number of interesting
varieties; my favorite is the M & M burger with caramelized shallots,
cheddar cheese, and apple smoked bacon flambéed in whiskey. 
What’s better than a New York City hot dog from a cart on the street?
How about two New York City hot dogs from a cart on the street? Better
yet, skip the cart and head to the Upper West Side Gray’s Papaya, 2090
Broadway at 72nd Street (% 212-799-0243), for one of the cheapest
meals on the planet, the “recession special”: $2.45 for two beef dogs and
a fruit drink. And the good thing is that at Gray’s, there’s always a reces-
sion. (See the “Uptown Dining” map.)
If you’re on the Upper East Side and yearn for a hot dog fix, head to
Papaya King, 179 E. 86th St. (% 212-369-0648), the poor man’s Gray’s
Papaya. (See the “Uptown Dining” map.)
New York delicatessens
New York delis are all about pastrami and attitude. And New York has
plenty of both. Some of the best delis include:
 Artie’s Delicatessen, 2290 Broadway between 82nd and 83rd streets
(% 212-579-5959). This new kid on the deli block can hold its own
on the playground with the big boys, thank you very much, espe-
cially in the wiener department. (See the “Uptown Dining” map.)
 Barney Greengrass, the Sturgeon King, 541 Amsterdam Ave.
between 86th and 87th streets on the Upper West Side (% 212-
724-4707). This unassuming, daytime-only deli has become leg-
endary for its high-quality salmon (sable, gravlax, Nova Scotia, kip-
pered, lox, pastrami — you choose), whitefish, and sturgeon (of
course). (See the “Uptown Dining” map.)
 Carnegie Deli, 854 Seventh Ave. at 55th Street (% 800-334-5606 or
212-757-2245). Even big eaters may be challenged by mammoth
sandwiches with names like “Fifty Ways to Love Your Liver”
(chopped liver, hard-boiled egg, lettuce, tomato, and onion). (See
the “Midtown Dining” map.)
 Katz’s Delicatessen, 205 E. Houston St. at Ludlow Street (% 212-
254-2246). The tour buses line up outside Katz’s for good reason:
This old-world deli is the city’s best. But be prepared to wait or try
to hit it in the off hours. (See the “Downtown Dining” map.)

Sweet treats
As all of you are my witnesses, I now stand and confess: I am a sugar
addict. I cannot end a meal without a decadently sweet fix. Be it ice cream,
cake, cookies, or candy, I’m like that spoiled girl in the movie Willie Wonka
and the Chocolate Factory. You know, “I want the world . . . I want the
whole world,” as long as the major ingredient is sugar. Fortunately, I live 
in New York, and thus I can fulfill my constant sweet cravings. So if you
suffer as I do, look for some of New York’s best sweet sources to help get
you through the day.
Ice cream
For the best ice cream in New York, you have to travel across the
Brooklyn Bridge to the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory, Fulton Ferry
Landing Pier in Brooklyn (% 718-246-3963), where everything is freshly
made, including the hot fudge for your sundae. (See the “Brooklyn
Dining” map.) For original, exotic flavors, like Green Tea, Red Bean, 
and Almond Cookie — perfect complements to a spicy Asian meal in
Chinatown — head to the Chinatown Ice Cream Factory, 65 Bayard St.
between Mott and Elizabeth streets (% 212-608-4170). (See the
“Downtown Dining” map.) Jon Snyder, owner of the curiously named Il
Laboratorio del Gelato, 95 Orchard St. between Broome and Delancey
streets (% 212-343-9922; www.laboratoriodelgelato.com), uses only
the freshest ingredients to create sweet magic in his laboratory. (See the
“Downtown Dining” map.)
A new entry into the New York ice cream market is the Arizona-based
Cold Stone Creamery at 253 W. 42nd St. between Seventh and Eighth
avenues (% 212-398-1882) and 1651 Second Ave. at 86th Street (% 212-
249-7080; www.coldstonecreamery.com). The super-rich ice cream here
is mixed on a frozen granite stone and made into creations like “mud pie
mojo,” “coconut cream pie,” and the irresistible “German chocolate cake.”
(See the “Midtown Dining” and “Uptown Dining” maps.)
Serendipity 3, 225 E. 60th St. between Second and Third avenues (% 212-
838-3531), serves regular meals, but why bother when you can go right to
the restaurant’s signature dish: the Frozen Hot Chocolate, a slushy version
of everybody’s cold-weather favorite. (See the “Midtown Dining” map.)
Mmmm . . . hot chocolate
Although the second coming of the Ice Age could not deter me from
seeking out ice cream, some people, inexplicably, feel that ice cream is
best eaten in hot weather. The winter alternative to ice cream is hot
chocolate, and at some bakeries and candy stores, the hot chocolate is
so rich and so good that the next time you have to succumb to one of
those packages of Swiss Miss, you’ll find yourself spitting the vile swill
across the room.
At Jacques Torres Chocolate, 60 Water St. in Brooklyn (% 718-875-9772;
www.mrchocolate.com), the lines on winter weekends begin forming at

9 a.m. Customers wait for hot chocolate perfected by the former pastry
chef of the restaurant Le Cirque. You can choose from many varieties,
but the most popular is the hot chocolate with allspice, cinnamon, sweet
ancho chile peppers, and hot chipotle peppers. (See the “Brooklyn
Dining” map.)
The Chocolate Bar, 48 Eighth Ave. between Jane and Horatio streets 
(% 212-366-1541; www.chocolatebarnyc.com), features not only hot
chocolate, but chocolate tea, and if you can’t live without the stuff in the
middle of August, Iced Chocolate as well. (See the “Downtown Dining”
map.) Both Jacques Torres and The Chocolate Bar also make sinfully
delicious chocolates to accompany your chocolate beverage. And if that
doesn’t get you through the day, nothing will.
Baked goods
For something sweet to go with that hot chocolate, New York has no
shortage of bakeries. The baked goods at the Buttercup Bakery, 973
Second Ave. between 51st and 52nd streets (% 212-350-4144), live up 
to the store’s mouth-watering name. And besides incredible cakes and
pies, the Buttercup makes the best banana pudding in town. 
In the East Village, Moishe’s Kosher Bake Shop, 115 Second Ave.
between Sixth and Seventh streets (% 212-505-8555), bakes fresh chal-
lah and babka daily, but I go for the perfect black-and-white cookies.
(See the “Downtown Dining” map.) On the Upper West Side, you can’t
find better cupcakes (in such flavors as Oreo cookie, Heath Bar, and
Coconut) than at Crumbs, 2211⁄2 Amsterdam Ave. between 75th and
76th streets (% 212-712-9800).

Part IV
Exploring 
New York City

In this part . . . 
H
ow do you get to Carnegie Hall? Practice . . . and the N,
R, or W train! Here’s where I go over the top attrac-
tions, guided tours, the shopping scene, and speciﬁc itiner-
aries that guarantee a good time no matter how long your
visit lasts.

Chapter 11
New York’s Top Sights
In This Chapter
 Honing in on New York City’s top sights
 Finding the best attractions to match your interests
 Taking a guided tour by bus, boat, or on foot
I
t’s taken me years to get around to seeing many of the sights I’m rec-
ommending that you visit during the week or few days you’re here. To
get in as much as possible in the time you have, consider these pointers:
 Visit the more popular museums and attractions as early as possi-
ble before lines begin to form. Check the hours of the attraction
and do your best to be there at or near the time the attraction
opens to avoid wasting time waiting on lines.
 Plan each half day so that the sights you want to see are close by.
For example: Visit the World Trade Center site early because you
don’t have to worry about times of operation. Then walk over to
Wall Street and the Financial District, take in one of the lower
Manhattan museums, and then either walk or take a subway to
Chinatown for lunch.
 Consider a guided bus tour or a Manhattan island cruise. Most
are around three hours long, and you get a good overview of the
city’s attractions. After the tour is done and you’ve seen all the
major landmarks, you can spend more of your time concentrating
on what interests you, which may include something you saw
during your tour.
 Buy tickets in advance. Some attractions, like the Empire State
Building, sell tickets online. They may be slightly more expensive,
but if you’re looking to save time from waiting on a line, the few dol-
lars may be worth it. Purchasing a CityPass (see the sidebar “Save
time and money with CityPass,” later in this chapter) saves you
both money and ticket-buying time.

New York City’s Top Sights
American Museum of Natural History
Upper West Side
You need at least two hours to take in even a small sampling of this vast
museum, which spans four city blocks. In addition to special exhibitions,
the museum features an astonishing permanent collection of taxidermic
wildlife (including a famous herd of African elephants); an enormous exhi-
bition dedicated to biodiversity; interactive exhibits for kids; and displays
of gems, dinosaur fossils, and meteorites, among other treasures. It also
has an IMAX theater. The planetarium — a huge sphere housed in a glass
box several stories tall — is part of the Rose Center for Earth and Space.
The top half of the sphere houses the state-of-the-art Space Theater, which
airs a breathtaking space show “Cosmic Collisions” narrated by Robert
Redford; the bottom half houses the Big Bang, a multisensory re-creation
of the first moments of the universe.
See map p. 180. Central Park West (between 77th and 81st streets). % 212-769-5100.
www.amnh.org. Subway: B, C to 81st Street/Museum of Natural History stop, then
walk south along the front to the entrance. Bus: M10 (north/south bus running on
Central Park West, Eighth Avenue uptown, and Seventh Avenue downtown), and M79
(crosstown bus running on 79th Street) stop right at the museum. Suggested admis-
sion: $14 adults, $8 children ages 2–12 (free under 2), $11 seniors and students.
Museum admission plus Space Show: $30 adults, $19 children, $23 seniors and stu-
dents. Open: daily 10 a.m.–5:45 p.m., Fri 10 a.m.–8:45 p.m. The museum is fully acces-
sible to wheelchairs and the hearing impaired.
Bronx Zoo Wildlife Conservation Park
The Bronx
With more than 4,000 animals living on 265 acres, the Bronx Zoo is not only
the largest metropolitan animal park in the United States, it’s also one of
the city’s best attractions. Visit any of the numerous exhibits scattered
throughout the zoo; the best is the Wild Asia Complex, a zoo within a zoo
that includes Jungle World, an indoor re-creation of Asian forests, and the
Bengali Express Monorail (open May–Oct), which takes you on a narrated
ride high above free-roaming Siberian tigers, Asian elephants, Indian rhi-
noceroses, and other non-native New Yorkers. You can also visit the Congo
Gorilla Forest, home to those inquisitive gorillas and other African rain-
forest animals. Also located within the zoo are a Children’s Zoo (open
Apr–Oct), Butterfly Zone, camel rides, and the Skyfari aerial tram (each
an extra $2 charge).
Fordham Road and Bronx River Parkway, the Bronx. % 718-367-1010. www.bronx
zoo.com. Subway: 2 to Pelham Parkway, and then walk west to the Bronxdale
entrance. Bus: Liberty Lines’ BxM11 express bus. Admission: $8 adults, $6 seniors, $5

additional charges may be applied for some exhibits.
Part IV: Exploring New York City 
182

Brooklyn Bridge
Downtown
With sweeping views of lower Manhattan, Brooklyn, and the New York
Harbor, the walk across the historic stone-and-steel Brooklyn Bridge is one
of my favorite New York activities. Crossing takes between 20 and 40 min-
utes each way, depending on how long you linger to enjoy the views. You
can sit on the benches along the way if you need a break or just want to
stop for a bit to try to comprehend that you’re really in New York and that
this is not a movie set.
The perfect complement to your stroll over the Brooklyn Bridge is a stop
for delicious homemade ice cream at the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory
% 718-246-3963, located in the shadow of the bridge at the Fulton Ferry
Fire Boat House on the river. The ice cream fortifies you for your return
stroll into Manhattan.
See map p. 176. Sidewalk entrance to the Manhattan end of the bridge is on Park
Row just across from City Hall, south of Chambers Street. Subway: 4, 5, 6 to Brooklyn
Bridge/City Hall; exit across the street from the entrance. Bus: M1 (north/south bus
running down Broadway and up Center Street/Lafayette/Park and Madison avenues),
although traffic congestion makes the subway a better choice.
Central Park
Upper West Side, Upper East Side
This 843-acre refuge in the middle of the city, is one of New York’s most
glorious wonders. (See the map “Central Park” for location details.)
Throughout the year, but especially in nice weather, Central Park is a sanc-
tuary for New Yorkers and visitors looking for a green escape from the
pace and tone of the city streets. (Though you can stay in touch with home
Chapter 11: New York’s Top Sights 183
Save time and money with CityPass
The New York CityPass (% 208-787-4300; www.citypass.net) gives you admis-
sion to six major attractions in the city: the American Museum of Natural History
(Space Show is not included), Circle Line Harbor Cruise, Empire State Building
Observatory, Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum, Guggenheim Museum, and Museum
of Modern Art (MoMA). The pass costs $63 ($46 for children ages 12–17), almost 50
percent less than you pay if you purchase each ticket separately. You can buy the
CityPass online, at the first attraction you visit, or at one of the Ticket axis electronic
kiosks maintained by NYC & Company (at the Visitor Information Center at 810 Seventh
Ave. between 52nd and 53rd streets), You can also pick up passes at NY Skyride on the
second floor of the Empire State Building, Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum, and at the
Circle Line. Note that the CityPass is good for only nine days, and it doesn’t include
admission to the NY Skyride show on the second floor of the Empire State building or
the Space Show at the Hayden Planetarium.

or office if necessary — Central Park is now wireless.) Here you can spend
hours strolling (or biking) miles of paths that wind through acres of land-
scaped fields and rolling hills. The park offers pleasures for kids of all 
ages — you and your children may enjoy taking a boat ride on the lake
(call Loeb Boathouse, % 212-517-2233, for rental information), skating
around Wollman Rink just north of the pond (% 212-439-6900), or visiting
the polar bears and other animals in Central Park Zoo. In the summer, the
park plays host to Shakespeare in the Park and SummerStage (see Chapter
14), a series of free concerts. For information about tours of the park, flip
to “Seeing the city on special-interest tours” and “Faring well with free
walking tours,” later in this chapter. 
Even though the park has the lowest crime rate of any of the city’s
precincts, keep your wits about you, especially in the more remote north-
ern end. It’s a good idea to avoid the park after dark, unless you’re head-
ing to one of the restaurants for dinner or to a SummerStage or
Shakespeare in the Park event.
See map p. 185. From 59th to 110th streets (between Fifth Avenue and Central Park
West, the continuation north of Eighth Avenue). Information Center: % 212-310-6600.
www.centralparknyc.org. Subway: A, B, C, D, 1 to 59th Street/Columbus Circle
stop for the southwest main entrance, N, R, W to Fifth Avenue/59th Street stop for the
southeast main entrance. Buses run along both sides of Central Park and make sev-
eral stops; the M10 runs up and down Central Park West, and the M1, M2, M3, and
M4 run south down Fifth Avenue on the east side of the park (they go north on
Madison Avenue). Open: 24 hours.
Chrysler Building
Midtown East
Number 405 Lexington Avenue is one of the most stunning buildings in New
York or any other city. Topped by a shiny steel needle, with triangular win-
dows that are illuminated at night, it looks like something out of Oz. Steel
sculptures are poised on its battlements like gargoyles. The building was
designed by William Van Alen; finished in 1930, it enjoyed the title of world’s
tallest building until 1931, when the Empire State Building was completed.
The observation deck is no longer open to the public, but be sure to visit
the lobby — an Art Deco tour de force in chrome, wood, and marble.
See map p. 178. 405 Lexington Ave. (at 42nd Street). Subway: 4, 5, 6, 7, S to 42nd
Street/Grand Central stop, follow the exit signs for Lexington Avenue, pass the bar-
rier, and take the passage in front of you toward the right, which brings you right
inside the Chrysler at the lower level. If you miss this exit, go up to street level and
cross the street walking east. Bus: M104 from the Upper West Side (runs down
Broadway and crosses town at 42nd Street) and M42 across town on 42nd Street;
both stop right in front of the building. On the east side and from downtown, take the
M101, M102, or M103 (running up Third Avenue and down Lexington Avenue). Open:
Mon–Fri 8 a.m.–6 p.m.

Chapter 11: New York’s Top Sights 185

The Cloisters
Upper Manhattan
Located at the north end of Manhattan in Fort Tryon Park, this museum is
constructed from portions of medieval and early Renaissance European
cloisters that were shipped across the Atlantic. The Cloisters houses an
important collection of medieval art, including stained glass, metalwork,
sculpture, and an impressive series of unicorn tapestries. The gardens that
hug one side of the complex authentically reproduce the herbs, flowers,
and other plants found in typical medieval cloisters. Both the museum and
the gardens have a commanding view of the Hudson River and the New
Jersey Palisades. If you choose to get here by bus, consider that although
the bus takes you right to the museum and offers a scenic, interesting ride,
the ride is a long one (up to an hour or more, depending on where you
start, as compared to 30 to 45 minutes on the subway). The subway is a
good alternative; it takes you right to the entrance of Fort Tryon Park.
See map p. 187. At the north end of Fort Tryon Park, 1 block north of West 190th Street.
% 212-923-3700. www.metmuseum.org. Subway: A to 190th Street stop, and then
take the elevator to street level (don’t walk up the long ramp — it takes you out of
your way). Once outside, you see the park entrance; walk north along Fort
Washington Avenue to the entrance of Fort Tryon Park and follow the signs along
the path north to the Cloisters. Bus: The M4 (north/south bus running on Madison
Avenue, 110th Street, Broadway, Fort Washington Avenue uptown, and Fifth Avenue
downtown) is very convenient and stops right at the museum; if you’re in a hurry, you
can take the subway and then catch the bus for the last part of the run. Suggested
admission: $12 adults, $7 seniors and students, free for children under 13 when
accompanied by an adult; fee includes admission to the Metropolitan Museum. Open:
Tues–Sun 9:30 a.m.–5:15 p.m.; Nov–Feb closes at 4:45 p.m.
Ellis Island
Downtown
From its opening in 1892 to its closing in 1954, more than 12 million immi-
grants, including my own ancestors, entered America through the Registry
Hall on Ellis Island. After a $160 million restoration in the 1980s, it
reopened as a museum dedicated to the history of immigration. An enor-
mous pile of luggage and other personal items (children’s dolls, hair-
brushes, clothing, and the like) remind visitors of the huddled masses who
passed through here. Other exhibits illustrate how these immigrants
changed the demography of the United States. And the American
Immigrant Wall of Honor remembers more than half a million people who
came to the U.S. in search of a better life. Ellis Island offers an optional
audio tour (narrated by Tom Brokaw) and a documentary film called Island
of Hope, Island of Tears. Note that a round-trip ferry ticket to Ellis Island
includes a trip to Liberty Island, the site of the Statue of Liberty.
See map p. 176. In New York Harbor. % 212-363-3200 for general information, 212-
269-5755 for ticket and ferry information. www.statueoflibertyferry.com or
www.nps.gov/elis. Transport: Ferry from Battery Park. Subway to ferry ticket
booth: 4, 5 to Bowling Green stop, and then walk through the park heading south; the

Ellis Island $12 adults, $4.50 children ages 3–17 (free under 3), $9.50 seniors. Open:
daily 9:30 a.m.–5 p.m. (extended hours in summer). Ferries run from Manhattan about
every 30 minutes, in winter 10:30 a.m.–3:30 p.m. and in summer 9 a.m.–4:30 p.m.
Tickets are sold only until an hour before the last ferry departs. Note that if you want
to visit both Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty, you can’t take the last ferry; taking
the last ferry enables you to visit only one of the two attractions. Due to security
restrictions, no backpacks, luggage, or coolers are allowed.
Empire State Building
Midtown East
You can’t see King Kong dangling from the top of the Empire State Building
as he did in the 1933 and 2005 versions of King Kong, but you can get one of
the best views of Manhattan from this 1,472-foot Art Deco structure — that
is, if visibility is good the day you go. You can find a visibility rating posted
in the lobby of the building, and you should take the rating seriously — zero
visibility means that you really won’t see a thing except clouds and fog. The
observatory is on the 86th floor and has both an outdoor and an indoor
viewing area. Huge lights glow in the top of the building and are lit up in dif-
ferent colors at night in honor of various holidays. On the second floor is
the NY Skyride (% 212-279-9777), a simulated aerial tour of New York,
which is worth seeing if you can’t go for the real thing.
Lines to visit the observation deck can be horrible at the concourse-level
ticket booth, so be prepared to wait — or purchase advance tickets online
using a credit card at www.esbnyc.com. You pay slightly more — tickets
were priced $2 higher on the Web site at press time — but it’s well worth
it, especially if you’re visiting during busy seasons, when the line can be
shockingly long. You’re not required to choose a time or date for your tick-
ets in advance; they can be used on any regular open day. However, order
them well before you leave home, because only regular mail shipping is
free. Expect them to take 7 to 10 days to reach you (longer if you live out
of the country). Overnight delivery adds $15 to your total order. With tick-
ets in hand, you’re allowed to proceed directly to the second floor — past
everyone who didn’t plan as well as you did!

Grand Central Station
Midtown East
Even if you’re not catching one of the Metro-North commuter trains, make
Grand Central part of your itinerary. Finished in 1913 and beautifully reno-
vated ten years ago, this Beaux Arts masterpiece features a 12-story vibrant
blue ceiling on which the stars of the zodiac are traced in 24-karat gold and
a central kiosk over which the landmark brass clock is perched. Aside from
the gorgeous main concourse, Grand Central offers a very good dining con-
course on the lower level; top restaurants including Michael Jordan’s The
Steakhouse, the famous Oyster Bar & Restaurant (a glitzy bar), and
Campbell Apartment; and a gourmet food market, Grand Central Market.
You can enjoy a guided tour ($10 suggested donation) of the terminal given
by the Municipal Art Society (12:30 p.m. Wed; % 212-935-3960).
See map p. 178. Main entrance on 42nd Street at Park Avenue. Subway: S, 4, 5, 6, 7
train to 42nd Street/Grand Central stop. Bus: M1, M2, M3, M4 running up Madison
Avenue and M101, M102, M103 running down Lexington Avenue take you right there.
Open: 24 hours.
Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum
Midtown West
The USS Intrepid, an aircraft carrier that saw active duty in World War II, is
the focal point of this large naval museum and is now a National Historic
Landmark. On deck, you find 40 aircraft from various periods on display.
Some of the other vessels moored here are the submarine Growler, the
naval destoyer USS Edson, the A-12 Blackbird (the world’s fastest spy
plane), and the newest addition, a retired British Airways Concorde jet.
For the kids, this is like an educational amusement park with thrill rides
like the naval flight simulator. Memorabilia and naval displays are housed
below decks. Note: Unfortunately, the Intrepid is closing in late 2006 for
repairs. It is scheduled to reopen in 2008.

Metropolitan Museum of Art
Upper East Side
As the largest museum in the Western Hemisphere, the Met has something
for everyone, from its world-famous Egyptian collection to its massive
holdings of European and American masterpieces to its beautiful sculp-
ture garden. Highlights also include the Asian collection, the collection of
Chapter 11: New York’s Top Sights 189

musical instruments, and the armor collection. And kids love the costume
displays on the lower level. You’re not going to get all of this in only one
visit, so try to narrow your focus before you go. Tours of various parts of
the collection are conducted several times an hour; you also can take a
self-guided audio tour or a “highlights” tour. For schedules, check the tour
bureau in the Great Hall or call % 212-570-3930.

Museum of Modern Art (MoMA)
Midtown West
After two years of being temporarily ensconced in Queens, MoMA
returned to its original Manhattan location in late 2004. And though the
address is the same, the building is now, with over 630,000 square feet,
almost twice the size of the original. The renovation, designed by Yoshio
Taniguchi, highlights space and light, with open rooms, high ceilings, and
gardens — a beautiful work of architecture and a perfect complement to
the art that resides within. This is where you’ll find van Gogh’s Starry Night,
Cezanne’s Bather, Picasso’s Les Demoiselles d’Avignon, and the amazing
sculpture by Rodin, Monument to Balzac. Whenever I visit, I like to browse
the fun “Architecture and Design” department, with examples of design for
modern appliances, furniture, and even sports cars. MoMA also features
edgy new exhibits and a celebrated film series that attracts serious
cinephiles. But the heart of the museum, as it was before the renovation,
remains the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden, which has been
enlarged; the museum’s new design affords additional views of this lovely
space from other parts of the museum.

tower. The entertainment ranges from the outdoor skating rink to Radio City
Music Hall, where the Rockettes perform. Call % 212-247-4777 for back-
stage tours, and see Chapter 14 for more information. You can tour the NBC
Studios (call % 212-664-3700), where NBC’s “Today” show tapes. Show up
with your “We [heart] You, Matt!” sign and you may get on TV. A multitude
of stores and restaurants are located under the center’s concourse. For a

Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum
Upper East Side
Frank Lloyd Wright designed this famous museum, whose swirling, shell-like
shape resembles a . . . hmmm, I’m not really sure; I’ll let you decide. Inside,
the exhibition space curves in a spiral; you can take an elevator to the top
and work your way down if you don’t want to make the hike up. Exhibits are
constantly changing. The museum’s addition, the Tower Galleries, holds the
permanent collection of 19th- and 20th-century art, which includes works
by the Impressionists and founding modernists, including Picasso. Free
tours of the museum are available; check the Web site for special events like
films, concerts, and lectures that may be on the schedule.
The Guggenheim has a branch museum in SoHo, at 575 Broadway at Prince
Street (% 212-423-3500). The SoHo branch houses continually changing

Top of the Rock
Giving the Empire State Building some friendly competition in the spectacular views
arena is the observation deck of 30 Rockefeller Plaza known as Top of the Rock. First
constructed in 1933 to invoke the grandeur of a luxury ocean liner, the 70th floor deck
was closed in 1986, but reopened in late 2005. Though not quite as high as the Empire
State Building, the deck here is more spacious and the views just as stunning. You
might have just as much fun getting up to the observation deck as you will on the deck
itself; the glass-ceiling sky shuttle elevators project images from the 1930s through
present day as they zoom their way up. Reserved time tickets help minimize the lines
and are available online. The observation deck is open daily from 8:30 a.m. to midnight;
admission is $14 for adults, $12 for seniors, $9 for ages 6 to 11, and free for children
under 6. For more information call % 877-NYC-ROCK (877-692-7625) or 212-698-2000;
or visit www.topoftherocknyc.com.

and walk 2 blocks north to the entrance. Bus: The bus is a good idea because it brings
you closer: Take the M1, M2, M3, M4 up Madison and walk 1 block west (it goes south
on Fifth), or take the M86 crosstown on 86th Street. Admission: $18 adults, $15 sen-
iors and students, free for children under 12 when accompanied by an adult; pay
what you wish on Fri 6–8 p.m. Open: Sun–Wed 10 a.m.–5:45 p.m., Fri–Sat 10 a.m.–
8 p.m. Closed Thurs.
Staten Island Ferry
Downtown
You can’t beat the price of this attraction — it’s free. And not only do you
get an hour-long excursion (round-trip) in New York Harbor, but you get
beautiful views of the Statue of Liberty. You also get to mingle with com-
muters: people who take this ferry everyday to work in Manhattan. Your
journey also provides great views of Ellis Island, the Verrazano Narrows
Bridge, and Governor’s Island. Returning from Staten Island, you can enjoy
that very famous view of the lower Manhattan skyline.
See map p. 176. Departs from the Whitehall Ferry Terminal at the southern tip of
Manhattan. % 718-727-2508. www.ci.nyc.ny.us/html/dot. Subway: R, W to
Whitehall Street; 4, 5 to Bowling Green; 1 to South Ferry (ride in the first 5 cars).
Admission: free ($3 for car transport on select ferries). Open: 24 hours; ferries run
Mon–Fri every 20–30 min., less frequently on off-peak and weekend hours.
Statue of Liberty
Downtown
Lady Liberty is one of the grandest symbols of what New York and America
stand for. And it’s for that reason that the interior and base of the Statue
were closed for security measures after the terrorist attacks of September
11, 2001. Access has improved, but is still somewhat limited (you can’t
climb to the Statue’s crown). Now you can explore the Statue of Liberty
Museum, peer into the inner structure through a glass ceiling near the base
of the Statue, and enjoy views from the observation deck on top of the 16-
story pedestal. Whether you choose to wander the grounds or just get a
look via the Staten Island Ferry, Circle Line Cruise, or on your way to Ellis
Island, the Statue of Liberty is a must-see.

Island $12 adults, $4.50 children ages 3–17 (free under 3), $9.50 seniors. Open: Daily
10:30 a.m.–5 p.m. (extended hours in summer). Ferries from Manhattan run about
every 30 minutes in winter 10:30 a.m.–3:30 p.m., in summer 9 a.m.–4:30 p.m. Tickets are
sold only until an hour before the last ferry. Note that if you want to visit both Ellis
Island and the Statue of Liberty, you can’t take the last ferry; taking the last ferry

enables you to visit only one of the two attractions. Due to security restrictions, no
backpacks, luggage, or coolers are allowed.
Times Square
Midtown West
There’s no doubting that Times Square has evolved into something much
different than it was over a decade ago when it had a deservedly sleazy
reputation. Yet there is much debate among New Yorkers about which
incarnation was better. For New Yorkers, Times Square is a place we go
out of our way to avoid. The crowds, even by New York standards, are sti-
fling; the restaurants, mostly national chains, aren’t very good; the shops,
also mostly national chains, are unimaginative; and the attractions, like
Madame Tussauds New York wax museum are kitschy. I suppose it’s a
little too Vegas for us. Still, you’ve come all this way; you’ve got to at least
take a peek, if only for the amazing neon spectacle of it.
Most of the Broadway shows are centered around Times Square, so plan
your visit around your show tickets. For your pre-dinner meal, walk 2
blocks west to Ninth Avenue where you’ll find a number of relatively inex-
pensive, good restaurants. If you are with the kids, the Ferris wheel in the
Toys “R” Us store makes a visit to Times Square worthwhile.
See map p. 178. At the intersection of Broadway and Seventh Avenue, between 42nd
and 44th streets. Subway: 1, 2, 3, 7, N, Q, R, S, W train to Times Square/42nd Street
stop. Bus: M6, M7 down Seventh Avenue or M104, M10 down Broadway offer a per-
fect view of Times Square.
United Nations
Midtown East
A guided one-hour tour of the United Nations headquarters examines the
history and purpose of the U.N. and takes you through the General
Assembly Hall and the Security Council Chamber. You also can walk
through the grounds and a beautiful garden (the rose garden is fantastic)
that offers a view of the East River, Roosevelt Island, and Brooklyn. The
grounds feature many sculptures that member states have given the U.N.,
like the symbolic pistol with a knot in the barrel, a gift from the govern-
ment of Luxembourg.

visitor entrance at 46th Street). % 212-963-8687. Subway: 4, 5, 6, 7, S to Grand
Central/42nd Street stop, walk east on 42nd Street to First Avenue, turn left, and walk
to the visitor entrance at 46th Street. Bus: Much more convenient than the subway;
take the M15 down Second Avenue and up First Avenue, the M104 down Broadway
and 42nd Street, or the M42 crosstown on 42nd Street. Admission: Free to the park and
lobby; guided tour $12 adults, $8.50 children, 5–14, $6.50 students, $8.50 seniors. Children
under 5 are not allowed on the guided tours. Open: 9:30 a.m.–4:45 p.m.; tours every 30
minutes 9:30 a.m.–4:15 p.m.; no tours on weekends in Jan and Feb. Reservations
required only for non-English tours (French, Spanish, Russian, or Chinese).

Wall Street and the Stock Exchange
Downtown/Wall Street
On weekdays, Wall Street offers a glimpse into the teeming world of finance
that characterizes lower Manhattan. This is where it all started; it’s the
historical heart of the city and its financial center today. See the 
skyscrapers — many among the first ever built — and throngs of people
who inhabit this world. While you’re here, visit the Stock Exchange, its
interactive information center (% 212-656-3000), and the Museum of
American Financial History (26 Broadway at Wall Street). The Stock
Exchange building, which dates from 1903, is a classical temple for dollar
worship; from the observation gallery, you can watch the world’s largest
stock frenzy in action. Closed to the public for security reasons, the gallery
is scheduled to reopen in the future, but at press time, no date has been
set. Call the information center to find out if tourist visits to the exchange
have resumed. If they have, get there early if you want to avoid a long wait
in line; admission is free, but you need admission tickets, which are given
out starting at 9 a.m.
See map p. 176. Wall Street runs between Broadway and South Street. New York
Stock Exchange: 20 Broad St. at Wall Street. % 212-656-3000. Subway: 4, 5 train to
Wall Street stop, or N, R to Rector Street, and then walk east across Broadway to
Wall Street. Bus: M1, M6 down Broadway and up Trinity Place. Admission: Free.
Open: Call for information.
World Trade Center site (Ground Zero)
Downtown
Do you call a place where over 3,000 people lost their lives an “attraction”?
Or do you now call it a shrine? This is the quandary of the World Trade
Center site. As the time of this writing it is still just a site, and though
ground was broken for rebuilding in the summer of 2004 controversy
remains over what actually will be built on the site. So don’t expect to see
much more than a big open hole for years to come. The most recent news
suggests that the planned “Freedom Tower” will be built by 2011. Don’t
hold your breath.
In the mean time, you can see the site through a viewing wall on the
Church Street side of the site; on that “Wall of Heroes” are the names of
those who lost their lives that day along with the history of the site, includ-
ing photos of the construction of the World Trade Center in the late 1960s
and how, after it opened in 1972, it changed the New York skyline and
downtown. A walk along the Wall of Heroes remains a painfully moving
experience.
See map p. 176. Broadway at Fulton Street. Subway: 1, 2, 4, 5, A, C, J, M, Z to Fulton
Street/Broadway Nassau stop, and then walk west on Fulton. Bus: M1 and M6 run

Yankee Stadium
The Bronx
Next to the Coliseum in Rome, you’re not going to find many sports arenas
more famous than the House That Ruth Built. The Yankees play from April
until October (and, because they seem to be in the playoffs most years,
mostly through Oct). Tickets, which range in price from $12 to $115, are
tough to snag, but if you plan in advance (and even if you don’t), you should
be able to score a seat by going through a broker or scalping (be careful of
forgeries) the day of a game. (For more information about admission to
Yankees’ games, see “The New York Sports Scene,” later in this chapter.
If your visit to New York falls during the off-season, you can still check out
Yankee Stadium by taking the Yankee Stadium Tour, which runs year-
round. The Insider’s Tour of Yankee Stadium (% 718-579-4531) is the
official tour of the stadium and takes you onto the field, to Monument Park,
and into the dugout. You even visit the press box and take a peek inside the
clubhouse. Tours are offered daily at 10 a.m., except for on New Year’s Day,
during Opening Day preparations (and usually during the three weeks
prior), on weekends when the team is at home, and on weekdays when a
home day game is scheduled. If you’re timing allows you to catch a tour,
plan to arrive by 9:40 a.m. Tickets for the one-hour, basic Classic Tour are
$14 for adults and $7 for kids 14 and under. No reservations are required;
all you need to do is show up at the ballpark’s press gate just before tour
time, but it’s still a good idea to call ahead and confirm.

After you’ve seen the top sights, check out these additional attractions.
Other excellent museums
The Met and MoMA (see “New York City’s Top Sights,” earlier in this
chapter) are probably New York’s best-known art museums, but many,
many others are available for you to explore.
American Folk Art Museum
Midtown West
This gorgeous, ultramodern boutique museum is not only a stunning struc-
ture, but it also heralds American folk art’s entry into the top echelon of
museum-worthy art.
The modified open-plan interior features an extraordinary collection of
traditional works from the 18th century to the self-taught artists and crafts-
people of the present, reflecting the breadth and vitality of the American
Chapter 11: New York’s Top Sights 195

folk-art tradition. A splendid variety of quilts, in particular, makes the tex-
tiles collection the museum’s most popular. The book- and gift shop is out-
standing, filled with one-of-a-kind objects.

Tues–Thurs and Sat–Sun 10:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m., Fri 10:30 a.m.–7:30 p.m.
The Frick Collection
Upper East Side
This museum features the splendid collection of tycoon Henry Clay Frick
and is housed in his Gilded Age mansion, more or less as he organized it.
The painting collection includes works by old masters of the 16th and 17th
centuries, including Tiziano (also known as Titian), Vermeer, Rembrandt,
and El Greco, as well as 19th-century artists, including Turner and Whistler.
The furnishings and ceramic collections are also worth seeing. Enjoy some
fantastic art and see how the cultured aristocracy of Old New York lived.
Allow at least two hours.

10 not admitted, children under 16 admitted only with an adult); admission includes
audio guide. Open: Tues–Sat 10 a.m.–6 p.m., Sun 11a.m.–5 p.m.
Brooklyn Museum of Art
Brooklyn
New York’s second largest museum after the Met, the Brooklyn Museum
of Art is housed in a beautiful Beaux Arts building and has a collection that
includes major Egyptian and African art; in fact, it lays claim to the largest
collection of Egyptian artifacts in the world after London and Cairo. The
museum also contains important 19th-century American and European
paintings; 28 period rooms, some of them rescued from now-demolished
historic buildings; and an important sculpture collection, including a rich
Rodin gallery. The museum has built a reputation for dynamic temporary
exhibitions as well. Recent ones have included a stunning watercolor ret-
rospective, an exhibit of the Romanov treasures, and the controversial,
Giuliani-boycotted show “Sensation,” which presented cutting-edge art-
work from Britain. You’re not going to have any trouble getting here
because the museum has its own subway stop. Allow at least three hours.
On the first Saturday of every month, The Brooklyn Museum of Art runs a
program from 5 to 11 p.m. that includes free admission to the museum and
a slate of live music, films, dancing, curator talks, and other entertainment
that can get pretty esoteric — think karaoke, lesbian poetry, silent films,
experimental jazz, and disco. As only–in–New York events go, First
Saturday is a good one — you can always count on a full slate of cool.

Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum
Upper East Side
Part of the Smithsonian Institution, the Cooper-Hewitt is housed in the
Carnegie Mansion, built by steel magnate Andrew Carnegie in 1901. Some
11,000 square feet of gallery space is devoted to changing exhibits that are
invariably well conceived, engaging, and educational. Shows are both his-
toric and contemporary in nature. Many installations are drawn from

This New York treasure, boasting one of the world’s most important col-
lections of original manuscripts, rare books and bindings, master draw-
ings, and personal writings has reopened after two years of extensive
renovations. Those renovations include a welcoming entrance on Madison
Avenue; new and renovated galleries, so that more of the library’s hold-
ings can be exhibited; a modern auditorium; and a new Reading Room with
greater capacity and electronic resources and substantially expanded
space for collections storage.

Museum of Television & Radio
Midtown West
Have you ever wanted to travel back in time and “be there” during an unfor-
gettable TV or radio moment — to watch the first moon landing, hear Orson
Welles’s War of the Worlds radio broadcast, or see the first ever Sesame
Street program? Now you can. The Museum of Television & Radio has more
than 100,000 radio and television programs in its permanent collection,
Chapter 11: New York’s Top Sights 197

almost all of which are available for your viewing or listening pleasure. The
museum is actually more like a library; instead of wandering from one
exhibit to the next, you “check out” recordings or videotapes and play them
in audiovisual cubicles — anything from Sid Caesar to vintage cartoons to
your favorite commercials from childhood. Several theaters and listening
rooms can accommodate large groups for special screenings. “Exhibits” are
thematic documentaries that cover topics as diverse as “horror on TV” and
“the history of presidential campaign advertising” (on second thought,
maybe those two topics aren’t so diverse after all). It’s best to go during
the day, during the week; on evenings and weekends, the crowds make it
hard to get a viewing booth.

tries between 1863 and 1935. Now it’s a museum and a National Trust for
Historic Preservation. The tenement museum tells the story of the great
immigration boom of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when the
Lower East Side was considered the “Gateway to America.” The only way

Notable New York City architecture
You can walk the city streets with your eyes skyward and your mouth
open in awe over some of the magnificent structures scattered through-
out the city. The Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building are two
of the most famous buildings in New York and are also top sights (see
their listings earlier in this chapter). But you may want to gawk at some
of these other structures, too.

Flatiron Building
Flatiron District
The Flatiron Building (its original name was the Fuller Building) takes its
name from its unusual triangular shape. Built in 1902, it was one of the first
skyscrapers in Manhattan. Although only 20 stories tall, it’s one of the
most recognized and unique buildings in the city. Now, the area sur-
rounding the building, which features a number of publishing houses, mod-
eling agencies, and dot.com companies, has been named after the building
and is known as the “Flatiron” district.

Street). Subway: N, R train to 23rd Street. Bus: M6 and M7 down Broadway or M2,

New York Public Library
Midtown West
With its white Corinthian columns, allegorical statues, and the world-
famous lion sculptures (their names are Patience and Fortitude) at the
entrance, the New York Public Library is one of the country’s finest exam-
ples of Beaux Arts architecture. Oh, and you can find a lot of good books
inside, too. A book- or publishing-related exhibit is usually scheduled at
the library. After a $5 million restoration, what was once known only as
Room 117, a Beaux Arts masterpiece with incredible views of Fifth Avenue
and 42nd St, reopened in late 2005 and is now known as the Lionel Pincus
and Princess Firyal Map Division. Here you will find possibly the finest and
most extensive collection of maps in the world.

U.S Customs House
Downtown
This 1907 National Historic Landmark houses the National Museum of the
American Indian, George Gustav Heye Center. The granite structure fea-
tures giant statues carved by Daniel Chester French (of Lincoln Memorial
fame); the statues lining the front personify Asia (pondering philosophi-
cally), America (bright-eyed and bushy-tailed), Europe (decadent, whose
time has passed), and Africa (sleeping). Inside, the airy oval rotunda,
designed by Spanish engineer Raphael Guastavino, was frescoed by
Reginald Marsh to glorify the shipping industry (and, by extension, the
Customs office once housed here).

Completed in 1913, the Woolworth was the tallest building in the world for
a time. Designed by famous architect Cass Gilbert, the Gothic tower is
known for its beautifully decorated interior and exterior. Mr. Woolworth paid
$15.5 million cash for the structure, and it shows. Besides the stunning exte-
rior, this building — once known as “The Cathedral of Commerce” — has
gorgeous mosaic ceilings, a marble staircase, and statues of people involved
in the building’s construction. Enjoy it from the outside, because of height-
ened security, the public is not allowed inside.

Beautiful places of worship
New York is a city known for its religious tolerance. Places of worship for
just about every denomination are everywhere, and many are housed in
remarkable structures worth checking out even if religion is not want
you came to New York to get.
Abyssinian Baptist Church
Harlem
This Baptist church, founded in 1808 by African-American and Ethiopian
merchants, is the most famous of Harlem’s 400-plus houses of worship.
The chamber of commerce has declared the church a “Living Treasure.”
Come for Sunday morning services at 9 and 11 a.m. to get a sample of the
Harlem gospel tradition.

Cathedral of St. John the Divine
Upper West Side
Towering over Amsterdam Avenue near the edge of Harlem is an unlikely
sight: the largest Gothic cathedral in the world. The cathedral, begun in
1892, is still only two-thirds complete; the towers, transcepts, choir roof,
and other aspects remain unfinished. The architects and builders have
continually employed Gothic engineering, stone-cutting, and carving tech-
niques. Numerous chapels throughout the cathedral commemorate vari-
ous ethnic groups and traditions. You can visit the towers on the first and
third Saturdays of the month. Three services per day are held during the
week (7:15 a.m., 12:15 p.m., and 5:30 p.m.), and four are held on Sunday 
(8 a.m., 9 a.m., 11 a.m., and 7 p.m.).
The cathedral hosts numerous concerts, including dance, choir, and classi-
cal music performances. But by far the most unforgettable special event is
the Blessing of the Animals, held in early October as part of the Feast of St.
Francis of Assisi. A procession of critters — everything from dogs and cats
to camels and elephants — parades through the church; each is blessed in
honor of St. Francis, the patron saint of animals. Call 212-316-7540 for tick-
ets; advance reservations are necessary for this popular event.

Trinity Church
Downtown
This Wall Street house of worship — with neo-Gothic flying buttresses,
beautiful stained-glass windows, and vaulted ceilings — was designed and
consecrated in 1846. The historic Episcopal church stood strong while
office towers crumbled around it on September 11, 2001; however, an elec-
tronic organ has temporarily replaced the historic pipe organ, which was
damaged by dust and debris. The gates to the historic church currently
serve as an impromptu memorial to the victims of the September 11, 2001,
Chapter 11: New York’s Top Sights 203

terrorist attack, with countless tokens of remembrance left by both locals
and visitors alike.
Also part of Trinity Church is St. Paul’s Chapel at Broadway and Fulton
Street, New York’s only surviving pre-Revolutionary church and a transi-
tion shelter for homeless men. It was transformed into a relief center after
September 11.

at groundbreaking (Mar 24, 1900) to the present. Kids can enjoy the inter-
active elements and the vintage subway cars, old wooden turnstiles, and

South Street Seaport and Museum
Downtown
The whole Seaport neighborhood is an important historical landmark that
has been progressively restored, in part by the South Street Seaport
Museum and in part by private businesses. This attraction offers a look at
commerce in the past and in the present. The Seaport’s cobbled streets
and restored brick buildings house many interesting shops and pubs, and
two huge warehouses from the days when sailing ships ruled trade now
contain indoor shopping complexes and fine restaurants. On the water-
side, the museum has completed the restoration of a number of historical
ships that you can visit, including the Peking, an enormous four-master
built of steel; the Ambrose, a lightship; and Lettie G. Howard, a fishing
schooner. Still under restoration are the Ellen McAllister, a large tugboat,
and the Marion M., a wood-hulled chandlery lighter. Two of the restored
Chapter 11: New York’s Top Sights 205

ships, the schooner Pioneer and the W. O. Decker, a cute wooden tugboat,
take people out for tours of the harbor from May through October.
At Pier 17 of the Seaport, on the third floor of the building there, two rows
of deck chairs line the south terrace and overlook the water. These chairs
are a great place to relax and take in the view of Brooklyn, the bridges, and
New York Harbor. On weekends, though, the seats fill up fast.

New York City for teens
Let’s not underestimate the interests of teenagers; I know many who are
much more adult than I am. On the other hand, I know a few who tend
toward the infantile. So what appeals to both adults and kids, probably
also appeals to teens. Still, don’t forget these options that may go over
well with the teens.
American Museum of the Moving Image
Queens
Is there a teenager who doesn’t like going to the movies? I don’t think so,
which is why this movie lovers’ museum is perfect for teens. “Behind the
Screen,” the museum’s major exhibit, is a two-floor installation that takes
you step-by-step through the process of moviemaking. The museum
houses more than 1,000 artifacts, from technological gadgetry to cos-
tumes, and interactive exhibits where you can try your own hand at sound-
effects editing or create your own animated shorts, among other
simulations. Teens also love the popular “BLIP: Arcade Classics from the
Museum Collection” exhibit of vintage, playable video games. The museum
is close to a working studio complex where many movies and TV shows
are filmed. Woody Allen and Martin Scorsese have made movies in the
neighborhood, so if you’re lucky, you may even happen upon a real movie
being made. “Insiders’ Hour” tours are offered every day at 2 p.m.

Fun for TV fans
With all the sitcoms and talk shows based in New York, the city often
feels like one big set. If applauding on cue is what you’d like to do while
you’re visiting the city, check out these major shows where you can do
just that.
One TV show you won’t need a ticket for is the Today show. All you have
to do to see Matt, Meredith, and Al is get up early and join the crowd out-
side the Rockefeller Center studio on 49th Street between Fifth and Sixth
avenues. (The show schedules more out-of-doors segments in warmer
weather, including the Friday Summer Concert Series.) You have a good
chance of getting on camera if:
 You’re holding up a creative sign.
 You want to propose to your significant other on the air.
 You show up and stick around during some really bad weather.
For the shows listed here, it’s a good idea to arrange for tickets as far in
advance of your trip as possible — I’m talking six months or more. Tickets
are always free. For more information about getting tickets to TV tapings,
contact NYC & Company at % 212-484-1222; www.nycvisit.com.

Part IV: Exploring New York City 
208

Don’t forget to stop by the Museum of Television & Radio. See the listing
in the section “More Cool Things to See and Do,” earlier in this chapter.
The New York Sports Scene
You can get a real feel for New Yorkers when you watch their hometown
teams. Sitting in the bleachers or nosebleed seats at Yankee Stadium or
at Madison Square Garden is a (cheap) thrill, and the minor league
teams are a hit in the big city.
Yankees and Mets: Major leaguers
With two baseball teams in town, you can catch a game almost any day
from opening day in April to the beginning of the playoffs in October.
(Don’t bother trying to get subway series tix, though — they’re the
hottest seats in town. Ditto for Opening Day or any play-off game.)
The Amazin’ Mets play at Shea Stadium in Queens (Subway: 7 to Willets
Point/Shea Stadium). For tickets (which ran $5–$45 for regular-season
games in the 2006 season) and information, call the Mets Ticket Office 
at % 718-507-TIXX, or visit www.mets.com.
The Bronx Bombers, a.k.a. the Yankees, haven’t won a World Series since
the turn of the century, so they are overdue to win their 27th. The Yanks
play at the House That Ruth Built, Yankee Stadium (Subway: C, D, 4 to
161st Street/Yankee Stadium). For tickets ($12–$100 in 2006), contact
Ticketmaster (% 212-307-1212 or 212-307-7171; www.ticketmaster.com)
or Yankee Stadium (% 718-293-6000; www.yankees.com). Most of the
expensive seats (field boxes) are sold out in advance to season ticket
holders. You can often purchase these very same seats from scalpers, but
you’ll pay a premium for them. Bleacher seats (the cheapest) are sold the
day of the game.
Down on the farm in New York: The minors
The Brooklyn Cyclones, the New York Mets’ A-level farm team, and the
Staten Island Yankees, the Yanks’ junior leaguers, both play in sparkling,
picturesque stadiums. What’s more, with bargain-basement ticket prices
(which topped out at $13 for the Cyclones, $11 for the Yanks in the 2006
season), these teams offer a great way to experience baseball in the city
for a fraction of the major-league hassle and cost. Both teams have
already developed a rabidly loyal fan base, so it’s a good idea to buy your
tickets for the 2007 summer season in advance.
The Cyclones have been a major factor in the revitalization of Coney
Island; Keyspan Park sits right off the legendary boardwalk. For
Cyclones info and tickets, call % 718-449-8497 or visit www.brooklyn
cyclones.com (Subway: D, F, N, Q to Stillwell Avenue/Coney Island).
Chapter 11: New York’s Top Sights 209

The SI Yanks play at the Richmond County Bank Ballpark, just a five-
minute walk from the Staten Island Ferry terminal (Subway: N, R to
Whitehall Street; 4, 5 to Bowling Green; 1 to S. Ferry). To reach the SI
Yanks, call % 718-720-9200 or go online to www.siyanks.com.
The city game: Basketball
Though the New Jersey Nets (www.njnets.com) are scheduled to be
moving to Brooklyn in 2007 or 2008, two pro teams now play in New York
at Madison Square Garden (Seventh Avenue between 31st and 33rd
streets; % 212-465-6741; www.thegarden.com; 212-307-7171 or www.
ticketmaster.com for tickets; Subway: A, C, E, 1, 2, 3, 9 to 34th Street).
MSG is the home court for the excitingly hapless New York Knicks
(% 877-NYK-DUNK or 212-465-JUMP; www.nyknicks.com). It’s also 
the home court for the New York Liberty (% 212-465-6080; www.ny
liberty.com), who electrify fans each summer with their tough-playing
defense and All-Stars like Becky Hammon.
Back on the Ice: NHL action
The New York Rangers also play at Madison Square Garden (Seventh
Avenue between 31st and 33rd streets; % 212-465-6741; www.newyork
rangers.com or www.thegarden.com; Subway: A, C, E, 1, 2, 3 to 34th
Street). The Rangers have been going through tough times, but tickets
are hard to get nevertheless, so plan well ahead; call % 212-307-7171,
or visit www.ticketmaster.com for online orders.
Seeing New York by Guided Tour
If your time is limited and you want an overview of the city’s highlights,
a guided tour is the way to go. Also, because New York has tours for just
about every interest, you’re sure to find one that fits your needs. Below
I’ve listed some of the best tours in the city.
If you decide to take a group tour, ask about group size when you call to
reserve your spot. Generally, you want as small a group as possible to
minimize the time required to get organized and move around.
Seeing the city by tour bus
Several companies offer very general city sightseeing tours, many on
double-decker buses. These tours are fine for seeing the sights and ori-
enting yourself to the city, but don’t expect too much from the running
commentary.
Gray Line New York Tours (% 800-669-0051 or 212-397-2600; www.gray
linenewyork.com) Gray Line offers just about every sightseeing tour
option and combination you could want. There are bus tours by day and
by night that run uptown, downtown, and all around the town, as well as
bus combos with Circle Line cruises, helicopter flights, museum admit-
tance, and guided visits of sights. There’s no real point to purchasing
Part IV: Exploring New York City 
210

some combination tours — you don’t need a guide to take you to the
Statue of Liberty, and you don’t save any money on admission by buying
the combo ticket. I’ve found Gray Line to put a higher premium on accu-
racy than the other big tour-bus operators, so this is your best bet
among the biggies. The All Loop tour is $44 for adults and $34 for chil-
dren, 5 to 11.
Although they aren’t tour buses, public buses crisscross the city. If
having a tour guide isn’t essential, consider taking advantage of the $2
tour that the buses afford. Try the M1 all the way down Fifth Avenue
from Museum Mile to 42nd Street; then change to the M104 and go
across to Times Square, up Broadway through the Theater District, past
Lincoln Center, and on to the Upper West Side. Or stay on the M1 all the
way to City Hall and Battery Park.
Cruising around the island
 Circle Line (% 212-563-3200; www.circleline42.com) offers the
famous “Full Island Cruise,” which sails around Manhattan in three
hours (daily Mar–Dec; $25 adults, $12 children, $20 seniors). The
cruise leaves from Pier 83 at West 42nd Street and Twelfth Avenue.
You see Manhattan from both sides, go under the George Washington
Bridge, and pass down through Hell Gate, the murky, swirling spot
where the East River and the Harlem River meet. Departing from the
same location, Circle Line also offers a shorter cruise, which goes
back and forth around the lower half of Manhattan and lasts two
hours (daily Mar–Dec; $20 adults, $10 children, $17 seniors); and a
Harbor Lights cruise, also a two-hour cruise (at dusk, call for precise
schedule; $20 adults, $10 children, $17 seniors). From Pier 16 at the
South Street Seaport, Circle Line has a one-hour Liberty cruise to see
the Lady and the harbor (daily Mar–Dec; $13 adults, $7 children, $11
seniors). Allow up to 45 minutes for ticketing and boarding.
Chapter 11: New York’s Top Sights 211
Transportation Alternatives
You really don’t want to burden that nag with a carriage ride through Central Park in
the middle of the summer, do you? Better you should hire a real beast of burden — a
driver of a pedicab who probably really needs the money. Pedicabs are becoming very
common sights on the streets of New York. The drivers are friendly and informative,
plus they don’t litter the streets. Manhattan Pedicab, Inc. (% 212-586-9486; www.
ajnfineart.com), one of the two primary pedicab companies, charges $35 for a
half hour, $65 for a full hour, and $10 for an impromptu street pick-up. Tours are also
available, including Upper East and Upper West Side Bar and Restaurant Tours, and
a Central Park–Rockefeller Center Tour. Another option is the Manhattan Rickshaw
Company (% 212-604-4729; www.manhattanrickshaw.com), whose fares range
from $8 to $15 for a pick-up to $50 for an hour’s ride.

To get to Pier 83 via the subway, take the A, C, or E train to Port
Authority or the N, Q, R, S, 1, 2, 3, or 7 to Times Square, and then
take the M42 bus westbound on 42nd Street or walk west to Twelfth
Avenue. To reach Pier 16, take the 1, 2, 4, 5, A, C, J, M, or Z train to
Fulton Street/Broadway Nassau and then walk east to the Seaport.
(See the “Midtown Attractions” map.)
 New York Waterways (% 800-533-3779; www.nywaterway.com),
the nation’s largest privately held ferry service and cruise operator,
also does the 35-miles around Manhattan, but does it on faster cata-
maran boats, passing by all the same sights as the Circle Line in
only two hours. They also offer a staggering amount of different
sightseeing options, including a very good 90-minute New York
Harbor Cruise, Romantic Twilight Cruise, Friday Dance Party
Cruise, and Baseball Cruises to Yankee games. The two-hour
Manhattan cruise goes around the island from Pier 78 at West 38th
Street and Twelfth Avenue and from Pier 17 at the South Street
Seaport (daily May–Nov from Pier 38, weekends May–Sept from
Pier 17; $24 adults, $12 children, $19 seniors). The 90-minute
harbor cruise departs from Pier 78 only and circles around the
lower part of Manhattan and up the East River (daily year-round,
but on a reduced schedule in January and February, so call for info;
$27 adults, $12 children, $16 seniors).
To reach Pier 78, take the free shuttle (blue, red, and white; it stops
at regular city bus stops and you hail it as a cab) that runs along
57th, 49th, 42nd, and 34th streets and up and down Twelfth Avenue;
or take the hotel bus that runs twice a day (call for route and
schedule). To get to Pier 17, take the 1, 2, 4, 5, A, C, J, M, or Z to
Fulton Street/Broadway Nassau and then walk east to the Seaport.
(See the “Midtown Attractions” map.)
 Bateaux New York (% 866-211-3806; www.bateauxnewyork.com)
offers gourmet lunch and dinner cruises under a glass dome: The
ship has a glass top with a special anti-fog system and is climate
controlled, making the evening cruises quite romantic. The three-
hour dinner cruise sails down the Hudson River and around to the
East River and back, passing by the Statue of Liberty (daily;
$88–$117). Jackets and ties required. Board 30 minutes before
departure from Pier 61 at Chelsea Piers. Via the subway, take the 
C, E train to 23rd Street and then the westbound M23 bus on 23rd
Street. (See the “Midtown Attractions” map.)
 Spirit Cruises (% 866-211-3805 or 212-727-2789; www.spirit
cruises.com) runs year-round cabaret-style cruises, including a
two-hour lunch cruise (with a narrated tour of the harbor and a
buffet lunch; ranging from $56 weekdays January through March up
to $125 weekends April through December) and a three-hour dinner
sunset cruise (with live music and a buffet; from $53 weekdays
Jan–Mar up to $84 Sat Apr–Dec). Prices include taxes and service.
Cruises board 30 minutes before departure from Pier 61 at Chelsea
Piers. To get there via the subway, take the C, or E train to 23rd
Street and then take the westbound M23 bus on 23rd Street.

Flying high with helicopter tours
If you can afford it, a helicopter tour is something you absolutely shouldn’t
miss! For a breathtaking tour, try Liberty Helicopters (% 212-967-6464;
www.libertyhelicopters.com), which offers several packages from
$69 up to $185. Liberty runs several tours every day, and reservations
are only necessary for groups of three people or more. The helicopters
can hold up to six people. Note that tours are very short — from about
10 minutes to about 25 minutes. The tours start both from the VIP
Heliport at West 30th Street and 12th Avenue and from the Downtown
Manhattan Heliport at Pier 6 and the East River (four blocks south of
Wall Street).
To get to the VIP Heliport by subway, take the A, C, or E train to Penn
Station, and then walk (or take the M34 crosstown bus) four blocks west
on 34th Street, turn left on Twelfth Avenue, and walk two blocks south.
To reach the Downtown Manhattan Heliport, take the 1 train to South
Ferry, walk northeast on South Street for approximately four blocks to
the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and turn right toward the water.
You will be asked to present identification before boarding a helicopter
tour, so make sure you have your driver’s license or passport with you.
Broadening your mind with architectural 
and historical tours
 The Municipal Art Society (% 212-439-1049 or 212-935-3960;

tours aimed at individualistic travelers. Each tour is led by a highly
qualified guide who gives insight into the significance of buildings,
neighborhoods, and history. Topics range from the urban history 
of Greenwich Village to “Williamsburg: Beyond the Bridge” to an
examination of the “new” Times Square. Weekday walking tours are
$12; weekend tours are $15. Reservations may be required depend-
ing on the tour, so it’s best to call ahead. A full schedule is also
available online.
 NYC Discovery Tours (% 212-465-3331) offers more than 70 tours

tory and literature (“The Charles Dickens Tours”). Tours are about

 Joyce Gold History Tours of New York (% 212-242-5762; www.
nyctours.com) features weekend walking tours of neighborhoods
all over Manhattan, going everywhere from Harlem to Wall Street.

the New School. Tours are conducted on weekends from March to
December and cost $12.
Chapter 11: New York’s Top Sights 213

 Adventures on a Shoestring (% 212-265-2663) is one of the earli-
est entrants into the booming walking tour market. Host Howard
Goldberg has provided unique views of New York since 1963,
exploring New York with a breezy, man-of-the-people style. Tours
focus on behind-the-scenes views of neighborhoods. A variety of
Greenwich Village tours emphasize the haunted, the picturesque,
and the historic; the Historic Roosevelt Island tour includes taking
the Roosevelt Island Tram. He even does theme walks, such as
“Marilyn Monroe’s Manhattan” and a “Salute to Katherine Hepburn.”

year, rain or shine.

 Hidden Jazz Haunts (% 718-606-8842), hosted by New York Jazz

tours are small (2 to 10 people), and he bases the destinations on
the jazz interests of his clients. If you’re into Bebop, he shows you
Minton’s Playhouse, the still-standing but now defunct jazz club
that was the supposed birthplace of bop. From there he takes you
to other, active Harlem clubs that he feels embody Minton’s Bebop

Chapter 12
Shopping in New York City
In This Chapter
 Surveying the shopping scene
 Knowing the big names
 Discovering the best shopping neighborhoods
 Finding the most interesting stores
You have to ask yourself two potentially tough questions when you
come to New York: Did you come here to see the sights, like the
Empire State Building or the Statue of Liberty? Or did you really come
here to hit the stores and explore all the city’s amazing shopping possi-
bilities, in essence, to give your credit card a major workout? Only you
know the answer to those questions. But if your answers involve your
credit card, when it comes to shopping, you can’t do better than New
York. This chapter gives you a starting point from which you can begin
your New York shopping adventure.
Surveying the Shopping Scene
First, you need to know that regular shopping hours don’t really exist in
New York. Most department stores are open Monday through Saturday
10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Sunday noon to 5 p.m., with a late-night Thursday
(and often Mon) until 8 p.m. However, the open hours of other stores,
shops, and boutiques vary widely, and the only way to know them for
certain is to call the store you want to visit.
New York City sales tax is 8.65%, but it is not added to clothing and
footwear items under $110. If you’re visiting from out of state, consider
having your purchases shipped directly home to avoid paying sales tax.
As with any shipped purchase be sure to get proper documentation of
the sale and keep those receipts handy until the merchandise arrives at
your door.
If you’re on the hunt for a specific item that we don’t mention in this
chapter, two excellent resources for shopping information are the
weekly magazines New York (www.nymetro.com), which spotlights
“sample” sales (see sidebar “Scoring at the sample sales,” later in this
chapter), and Time Out New York (www.timeoutny.com).

Knowing the Big Names
Shopaholics, I’m sure the names that follow are all very familiar to you,
but for the many others (also known as the non-shopping afflicted), this
list helps you get to know some of the biggest and best-known of the
New York stores.
 Barneys: This store sets the tone for upscale chic for both men and
women. 660 Madison Ave. at 61st Street (% 212-826-8900; www.
barneys.com; Subway: N, R, W to Fifth Avenue/59th Street). (See
the “Uptown Shopping” map.) Barneys Co-Op, in two locations,
downtown in Chelsea (236 W. 18th St. between Seventh and Eighth
avenues; % 212-593-7800; Subway: 1 to 18th Street) and uptown on
the Upper West Side (2151 Broadway between 75th and 76th streets;
% 646-335-0978; Subway: 1 to 79th Street), has blossomed into a
real fashion hotspot with its own strong identity, sisterly but sepa-
rate from the chic Barneys New York Madison Avenue headquarters.
Twice a year, Barneys hosts its famous warehouse sale in its ware-
house facility in Chelsea. Prices change daily, so markdowns are 50
to 80 percent off the original retail prices on all clothing and gifts. 
If you’re planning a shopping trip to the city, keep your eyes open
and your ear to the ground to find out when these sales occur. 255
W. 17th St. between Seventh and Eighth avenues.
 Bergdorf Goodman and Bergdorf Goodman Men: Bergdorf’s repre-
sents the pinnacle of exclusive shopping, with prices to match. 745
Fifth Ave. at 58th Street (main store) and 754 Fifth Ave. at 57th Street
(men’s store) (% 212-753-7300; www.bergdorfgoodman.com;
Subway: N, R, W to Fifth Avenue/59th Street). (See the “57th Street
Shopping” map.)
 Bloomingdale’s: Ever hear of Bloomies? If not, move on to the next

Chapter 12: Shopping in New York City 223

 Henri Bendel: The store is gorgeous and so are the goods inside —
super stylish and expensive stuff for women with a flair for the
funky and frilly. 712 Fifth Ave. between 55th and 56th streets 
(% 212-247-1100; Subway: N, R to Fifth Avenue). (See the “57th
Street Shopping” map.)
 Lord & Taylor: L&T is, in its own way, retro-chic, kind of the anti-
dote to those boutiques in SoHo and NoLiTa. The holiday windows
are always a treat. 424 Fifth Ave. at 39th Street (% 212-391-3344;
www.lordandtaylor.com; Subway: B, D, F, V to 42nd Street or the 
7 train to Fifth Avenue). (See the “Midtown Shopping” map.)
 Macy’s: Macy’s has something for every taste and every price
range. The annual floral show in its great hall is a special event as is
the thrill of meeting Santa — just like Natalie Wood did in Miracle
on 34th Street. The annual Thanksgiving Day parade ends here.
Herald Square where West 34th Street, Sixth Avenue, and Broadway
meet (% 212-695-4400; www.macys.com; Subway: B. D, F, N, Q, R, V,
W to 34th Street). (See the “Midtown Shopping” map.)
 Saks Fifth Avenue: If you only have time to stop in one department
store while you’re in town, Saks is the one. Smaller and more lavish
than some of the other department stores, Saks best typifies New
York verve and spirit. 611 Fifth Ave. at 50th Street (% 212-753-
4000; www.saksfifthavenue.com; Subway: E, V to Fifth Avenue/
53rd Street). (See the “Midtown Shopping” map.)
 Tiffany & Co.: Tiffany’s, as in Breakfast at Tiffany’s. You can ogle
the jewels, housewares, and other shoppers just like Audrey
Hepburn did in the classic movie. 727 Fifth Ave. at 57th Street 
(% 212-755-8000; www.tiffany.com; Subway: N, R, W to Fifth
Avenue/59th Street). (See the “57th Street Shopping” map.)
Shopping in Open-Air Markets
New York hosts some great outdoor farmers’ markets, flea markets, and
street fairs — weather permitting, of course.
New York has greenmarkets at different locations throughout the city 
on different days, but the biggest and the best is the Union Square
Greenmarket. You can find pickings from upstate and New Jersey farms,
fresh fish from Long Island, homemade cheese and other dairy products,
baked goods, plants, and organic herbs and spices. It’s a true New York
scene with everyone from models to celebrated chefs poring over the
bounty. The Union Square Greenmarket is open all year but is at its peak
August through October when the local harvest — tomatoes, corn,
greens, grapes, peppers, and apples — flourishes. The Greenmarket is
set up on the west and north sides of the square, between 14th and 17th
streets, every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday year-round
from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Go early for the best selection. (See the “Downtown
Shopping” map.)
Part IV: Exploring New York City 
224

Antiques are big in New York, and the locals love to browse and (some-
times) stumble upon real treasures in several markets.
 The Annex Antique Fair & Flea Market, on Sixth Avenue at 25th
Street, is probably the most famous market of its type. It has furni-
ture, but also a lot of bric-a-brac, and it’s open Saturday and Sunday
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (See the “Midtown Shopping” map.)
 The SoHo Antique Fair and Collectibles Market, on Grand Street
at Broadway, also has furniture and accessories. It’s open Monday
through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (See the “Downtown
Shopping” map.)
 The I.S. 44 Flea Market, on Columbus Avenue between West 76th
and 77th streets, specializes in secondhand clothes, antiques, and
jewelry; it’s open on Sundays from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (See the
“Uptown Shopping” map.)
On weekends from spring to fall, you can catch a major New York enter-
prise called the Street Fair. The Street Fair is a generic fair; the food,
clothes, and crafts sold by vendors are the same at every fair, and if
you’ve seen one, you’ve seen them all. Still, New Yorkers cram the
streets when they’re held, and not only can you find some good items at
very low prices, the fairs are fun for people-watching. Look for listings in
the magazines Time Out New York and New York.
New York’s sidewalks are also home to a plethora of (usually illegal)
street vendors. And they don’t succumb to bad weather. Indeed, at the
first sign of rain, men selling umbrellas magically appear on almost
every corner! Don’t spend more than $5 for an umbrella unless you’re
absolutely desperate. These “umbrella men” and other street vendors
operate year-round, working the streets and subway stations of the most

Scoring at the sample sales
A bargain-hunter’s dream, sample sales are events at which New York fashion design-
ers sell — at deep discounts — discontinued styles, overstocks, and the sample out-
fits they create to show to store buyers (hence the name “sample sales”). How great
are the deals? It’s entirely possible to get a $300 dress from a big-name designer for
$45 or less. Because the sales aren’t widely publicized and may last anywhere from
two days to a week, you have to hunt around to get the inside scoop. The weekly mag-
azines Time Out New York and New York publish lists of upcoming sales; you also can
try the Web sites www.nysale.com, www.dailycandy.com, and www.inshop.
com for information.
Bring cash; credit cards are rarely accepted. You have more to choose from if you fit
what designers call an “average” size — a U.S. 8 or 10 for women, a 40 for men. Items
are sold as-is, so try things on before you buy.

popular neighborhoods. Other vendors sell everything from socks to
“pre-owned” Rolex watches. Sometimes you can find bargains, but it’s
best to approach these enterprises with extreme skepticism. The thou-
sands of street vendors who offer gold jewelry and watches at cheap
prices are selling fake goods, of course — with the exception of the occa-
sional vendor of stolen merchandise. You can find fake Rolexes and
other phony big-name watches for as little as $25 if you bargain, even
less for smaller models or if you buy more than one. These pieces usu-
ally keep good time, but even if they don’t, you obviously won’t be get-
ting a warranty with your purchase. Other hotbeds for imitation (or
knock-off) designer goods and poor quality, bootleg DVDs are the stall
shops along Canal Street in Chinatown — see the following section for
more information.
Discovering the Best Shopping Neighborhoods
Zones for great shopping exist throughout New York. Some, however, 
are better than others. And new zones seem to sprout every year, so
you’re hard-pressed not to find good shopping no matter where you
happen to be. What follows are the best neighborhoods, as of this writ-
ing, for shopping.
Madison Avenue
If you can find any bargains on Madison Avenue, let me know, and I’ll
investigate that very rare phenomena. No, you won’t score any deals
here; the stores in this neighborhood are some of the most expensive in
town. But that doesn’t mean you can’t have fun window-shopping and
dreaming about winning the lottery.
High fashion (and high prices) is what you find in the stores on Madison
Avenue between 57th and 78th streets. (If you can’t find some of these
stores on the “Uptown Shopping” map, check out the “Midtown Shopping”
map.) Here you can find Barneys (see the “Knowing the Big Names,” sec-
tion earlier in this chapter) and some other high-end emporiums. To catch
everything, start at one end and walk the length of this swanky strip. Take
the 6 train to 77th Street and walk south; or take the 4, 5, 6 to the 59th
Street stop or the N or R to Lexington Avenue and walk north. I’ve men-
tioned only a few of my favorite stores along this strip; you’re sure to find
others along the way.
Along Madison Avenue, you find top European fashion designers’ shops,
such as the ultra-elegant Giorgio Armani, 760 Madison Ave. at 65th
Street (% 212-988-9191), and his younger and less expensive line,
Emporio Armani, 601 Madison Ave. at 60th Street (% 212-317-0800);
the sometimes-outrageous Moschino, 803 Madison Ave. at 68th Street
(% 212-639-9600); the trendy Italian designer Dolce & Gabbana, 825
Madison Ave. at 69th Street (% 212-249-4100); and the famous
Valentino, 747 Madison Ave. at 65th Street (% 212-772-6969).
Part IV: Exploring New York City 
226

American designers are represented, too. Browse Calvin Klein, 654
Madison Ave. at 60th Street (% 212-292-9000); Eileen Fisher, 521
Madison Ave. at 53rd Street (% 212-759-9888); and Polo/Ralph Lauren
and Polo Sport, 867 Madison Ave. at 72nd Street (% 212-606-2100),
among others.
If you’re in search of fine Italian shoes and leather, visit Prada, 841
Madison Ave. between 69th and 70th streets (% 212-327-4200). Don’t
forget to stop by Bulgari, 783 Madison Ave. at 67th Street (% 212-717-
2300), the big name in Italian jewelry, to see what the ladies in Monte
Carlo are wearing around their necks this year.
Fifth Avenue and 57th Street
From classic department stores to flagship “brand” stores like Disney,
you’ll find a lot of variety (except in price, which is usually high) on
luxury items, jewelry, clothing, and accessories in this area.
Midtown
Big name shopping is the order of the day in this area, centered on Fifth
Avenue south of 59th Street and East 57th Street up to Lexington Avenue.
(See the “Midtown Shopping” and “57th Street Shopping” maps.) This is
the area where you can find a number of major stores like Bloomingdales,
Tiffany & Co., Bergdorf Goodman, The Disney Store, and Saks Fifth
Avenue (see “Knowing the Big Names,” earlier in this chapter). To get
here, take the subway to one of the nearby stops: the E or V train to Fifth
Avenue/53rd Street, the N, R, or W to Fifth Avenue/59th Street, or the 4, 5,
or 6 to 59th Street. From any of these starting points, you can explore
north and south on Fifth Avenue and east and west on 57th Street.
Stores on this stretch include those of some top European haute couture
designers, such as Christian Dior, 21 E. 57th St. between Fifth and
Madison avenues (% 212-931-2950); Chanel, 15 E. 57th St. between Fifth
and Madison avenues (% 212-355-5050); Gianni Versace, 647 Fifth Ave. at
54th Street (% 212-317-0224); and Laura Biagiotti, 4 W. 57th St. at Fifth
Avenue (% 212-399-2533). The high-end names for accessories and shoes
are here also, including Ferragamo, 725 Fifth Ave. at 56th Street (% 212-
759-3822); Gucci, 685 Fifth Ave. between 53rd and 54th streets (% 212-
826-2600); Hermés, 11 E. 57th St. between Fifth and Madison avenues 
(% 212-751-3181); Louis Vuitton, 1 E. 57th St. at Fifth Avenue (% 212-
758-8877); and Fendi, 720 Fifth Ave. at 56th Street (% 212-767-0100).
Among the other big names in this area is Niketown, 6 E. 57th St. at Fifth
Avenue (% 212-891-6453), the five-floor shoe and clothing emporium
that appears to be one giant “Just Do It” commercial. As you enter, check
out the five-story screen that unfurls periodically to show a video mon-
tage of Nike’s ultra-famous pitchmen and -women. A few blocks down on
Fifth Avenue is The NBA Store, 666 Fifth Ave. at 52nd Street (% 212-515-
NBA1), where, in addition to all sorts of NBA and WNBA merchandise,
you may catch a player appearing for an in-store signing.

SoHo, NoHo, and NoLiTa
Head downtown for the edgy, the alternative, the hip, the tacky, and the
cheap (though sometimes it costs a lot of money to look cheap). (See
the “Downtown Shopping” map.)
Downtown
We all moan that SoHo is too trendy; do you really want to shop where
off-duty supermodels shop? Okay, don’t answer that one. Despite the
complaints, SoHo remains one of the best shopping neighborhoods in
the city; it’s the epicenter of cutting-edge fashion where you can defi-
nitely find something unique to show off to your friends back home.
NoLiTa and NoHo are two of the shopping zones of the moment. And the
“moment” has lasted for more than a few years now and doesn’t seem to
be fading. Here you can find tiny boutiques specializing in high-quality
fashion and design. Don’t expect cheap here, and if you’re an early bird,

do your shopping somewhere else first; most shops don’t put out the
welcome mat before 11 a.m.
SoHo is loosely bordered by Grand Street to the south, Avenue of the
Americas (Sixth Avenue) to the west, Broadway to the east, and Houston
to the north, forming a quadrangle. Here’s my suggested plan of attack:
Enter the quadrangle at one of the four corners and walk up and down
or left and right (pretend that you’re hoeing a field). Take the A, C, or E
train to Canal Street, the C or E to Spring Street, the N or R to Canal
Street or Prince Street, the 6 to Bleecker Street or Spring Street, or the F
or V to Broadway/Lafayette Street.
Designer boutiques include American Anna Sui, 113 Greene St. (% 212-
941-8406), and Todd Oldham, 123 Wooster St. (% 212-226-4668); French
Tehen, 91 Greene St. (% 212-925-4788); and Italian Dolce & Gabbana,
434 W. Broadway between Prince and Spring streets (% 212-965-8000).
The Hat Shop, 120 Thompson St. between Prince and Spring streets 
(% 212-219-1445), is a full-service milliner for women that also features
plenty of off-the-rack toppers. The same street also features shoe stores
galore — high-end home design and housewares boutiques add to the
appeal. The Puma Store, 521 Broadway (% 212-334-7861) offers an
amazing array of Puma athletic shoes made especially for non-athletes.
Rizzoli, 454 W. Broadway (% 212-674-1616), a bookstore synonymous
with elegance, is also in the area; shop here for unusual editions and
extravagant art books. Kate’s Paperie, 561 Broadway (% 212-941-9811)
features paper products; stationery, note paper, cards, and paper toys
so scrumptious you may be tempted to eat them. Just kidding.
NoLiTa and NoHo are on the east side of Broadway and Lafayette from
SoHo. You find smaller buildings, smaller shops, and a less hyped atmos-
phere in these neighborhoods. Interesting boutiques dot the tree-lined
streets; the best streets to start your exploring are Elizabeth and Prince.
Lunette Et Chocolat, 25 Prince St. between Elizabeth and Mott streets
(% 212-925-8800), translates, I think, to eyewear and chocolate. Here
you can ponder your choice of frames while having a chocolate crepe at
the garden cafe in the rear. Now that’s the kind of shopping I like.
Herald Square and the Garment District
You can actually find some bargains around here, along with an actual
mall. (See the “Midtown Shopping” map.)
Midtown
This area is dominated by the self-proclaimed, “Biggest Department
Store in the World”: Macy’s. But you can also find Lord & Taylor here
(see “Knowing the Big Names,” earlier in this chapter). But it’s because
of Macy’s and Lord & Taylor that the area has attracted other big names
like Old Navy, 150 W. 34th St. (% 212-594-0049), where you can outfit
your extended family at bargain-basement prices; discounter H&M,
Chapter 12: Shopping in New York City 229

1328 Broadway at 34th Street (% 212-564-9922); and the mega-sneaker
emporium, Foot Locker, 120 W. 34th St. (% 212-629-4419). At Sixth
Avenue and 33rd Street is the Manhattan Mall (% 212-465-0500), where
you can find mall standards like Radio Shack and LensCrafters.
Chinatown and the Lower East Side
The heart of Chinatown’s commercial zone runs along Canal Street, from
West Broadway to the Bowery. (See the “Downtown Shopping” map.)
Here, interspersed with more fruit, vegetable, and fish markets than you
can imagine, you pass store after store — most merely hallway-sized
stalls — selling “designer” sunglasses, watches, and handbags (think
Gucci, Coach, Louis Vuitton, and kate spade, for example), as well as
bootleg CDs and DVDs of just released movies. The film quality of these
bootlegs is so bad that you feel like you’re watching a movie through a
screen door. No matter what you find here, don’t expect quality; still, it
can be fun to browse, and after you get a sense of the prices, haggle a bit.
Existing alongside this extravaganza of fake merch is the other
Chinatown, where you can find quirky, one-of-a-kind Asian-inspired gifts
at bargain-basement prices. Mott Street, south of Canal Street, has a
stretch of knickknack and housewares shops that sell everything from
lacquered jewelry boxes and toys to embroidered silk pajamas and pot-
tery dinnerware. If you prefer one-stop shopping, try Pearl River, 477
Broadway at Grand Street (% 212-431-4770), technically in SoHo, this 
is a department store complete with a waterfall and specializing in all
things Chinatown — food, music, movies, clothing, and more.
The Lower East Side’s main shopping is on Orchard Street, now known
as the Historic Orchard Street Shopping District, which basically runs
from Houston to Canal along Allen, Orchard, and Ludlow streets, spread-
ing outward along both sides of Delancey Street. The bargains aren’t
quite what they used to be, but prices on leather bags, shoes, luggage,
and fabrics on the bolt are still quite good. Be prepared for the hard sell
and don’t worry about saying no.
Before you browse, stop into the Lower East Side Visitor Center, 261
Broome St. between Orchard and Allen streets (% 866-224-0206 or
212-226-9010; Subway: F to Delancey Street.), for a shopping guide that
includes vendors both old-world and new. Or you can preview the list
online at www.lowereastsideny.com.
Other shopping areas
A host of other shopping zones exist all around Manhattan. If you’re
looking for something specific, chances are there’s a part of town that
sells nothing but what you want. The most famous is probably the
Diamond District, a conglomeration of jewelry and gem stores along
West 47th Street between Fifth and Sixth avenues (www.47th-street.
com). If you’re after beads, crafts, and notions, the area between 35th
Part IV: Exploring New York City 
230

and 39th streets between Fifth and Sixth avenues is the place to go. In
the Village, Bleecker Street between Sixth and Seventh avenues is home
to a number of used CD stores (check out St. Mark’s Place between
Second and Third avenues as well).
Teenagers and those striving for a younger look love the shoes, clothing,
and leather shops that populate 8th Street from Second to Sixth avenues
(east of Broadway, 8th Street becomes known as St. Mark’s Place). Clothes
and accessories for trendsters are also to be found on Seventh and Ninth
streets.
Lower Manhattan and the Financial District
You won’t find any major shopping zones in Lower Manhattan and the
Financial District, but you will find a few excellent stores like Century
21, 22 Cortlandt St. (% 212-227-9092). This king of discount department
stores is across the street from the World Trade Center site, along with
the city’s best electronics retailer, J&R Music & Computer World, Park
Row (% 800-426-6067 or 212-238-9000), which is a block-long empo-
rium where you can find great prices on everything from cameras and
computers to CDs and software.
The most concentrated shopping in this area is at the South Street
Seaport (% 212/732-8257; www.southstreetseaport.com). Familiar
names like Abercrombie & Fitch, Bath & Body Works, Brookstone, and
the Sunglass Hut line Fulton Street, which is the Seaport’s main cobbled
drag; similar shops fill the levels at Pier 17, a waterfront barge-turned-
shopping mall. There’s nothing here you can’t get anywhere else in
Manhattan, but come anyway — for the historic ambience and the won-
derful harbor views.
Chapter 12: Shopping in New York City 231
They say it’s not a mall . . .
But what else would you call it? The Shops at Columbus Circle, located in the Time
Warner Center, features not only some of the biggest (and most expensive) names in
retail, but it also offers shopping with a view of Central Park. The mall, located just off
the southwest corner of Central Park, is two city blocks long and four stories high. But
the picturesque view doesn’t really matter to serious shoppers who are setting their
sights on the goods at retailers like Williams Sonoma, A/X Armani Exchange, Coach,
Hugo Boss, Joseph Abboud, Eileen Fisher, Thomas Pink, and the massive 59,000-
square-foot Whole Foods Market. For more information about the Shops, you can
check out the mall’s Web site at www.shopsatcolumbus.com or call % 212-
823-6300.

The Best of New York Shopping A to Z
If your shopping intentions are less of the browsing variety, here are
some of New York’s specialized shopping options.
Beauty
 C.O. Bigelow: Who’d think that a 166-year-old apothecary would
carry the city’s most eclectic, enjoyable, and international collec-
tion of healthy skin and personal care products? The goodies run
the gamut from Kusco-Murphy hair creams to French Elgydium
toothpaste, a bestseller. 414 Sixth Ave., between Eighth and Ninth
streets (% 212-533-2700; www.bigelowchemists.com; Subway: A,
C, E, F, V to W. 4th Street). (See the “Downtown Shopping” map.)
 Kiehl’s: More a cult than a store. Everyone from models to stock-
brokers stop by this always-packed old-time apothecary. 109 
Third Ave. between 13th and 14th streets (% 212-677-3171; www.
kiehls.com; Subway: L, N, R, 4, 5, 6 to 14th Street/Union Square).
(See the “Downtown Shopping” map.)
 Ricky’s: This chain of funky drug stores also features a wide range
of beauty products. If you’re just dying for a multi-colored wig, 
rainbow-colored lipstick, glitter galore, and more than 80 kinds of
hair brushes, and even edible undies, this is the store for you. At
numerous locations, including 44 E. 8th St. at Greene Street 
(% 212-254-5247; www.rickys-nyc.com; Subway: N, R to 8th
Street). (See the “Downtown Shopping” map.)
 Zitomer: This three-story drugstore is more a mini-department
store than a pharmacy. They have their own very good line of cos-
metics called Z New York. Big Apple lip gloss makes a wonderful
souvenir — something you won’t find in your local Walgreens. 969
Madison Ave. at 76th Street (% 212-737-2016; www.zitomer.com;
Subway: 6 to 77th Street). (See the “Uptown Shopping” map.)
Books
 Books of Wonder: This store is so saccharin that you may think
you’ve stepped onto the set of the children’s television show,
Barney. But just like they inexplicabley love Barney, kids also love
this place. 16 W. 18th St. between Fifth and Sixth avenues (% 212-
989-3270; www.booksofwonder.net; Subway: L, N, R, 4, 5, 6 to 14th
Street/Union Square). (See the “Midtown Shopping” map.)
 Coliseum Books: This is my favorite book store in New York. Before
there were Barnes and Noble superstores, there was Coliseum
Books. The store is now at a new location opposite Bryant Park. 
11 W. 42nd St. between Sixth and Fifth avenues (% 212-803-5890;
www.coliseumbooks.com; Subway: B, D, F, V to 42nd Street). (See
the “Midtown Shopping” map.)
Part IV: Exploring New York City 
232

 Drama Book Shop: This store has a resident theater company and
in-house performance space. Offering thousands of plays, from
translations of Greek classics to this season’s biggest hits, the shop
also offers books, magazines, and newspapers on the craft and
business of the performing arts. 250 W. 40th St. between Eighth 
and Ninth avenues (% 212-944-0595; www.dramabookshop.com;
Subway: A, C, E to 42nd Street). (See the “Midtown Shopping” map.)
 Forbidden Planet: Here’s the city’s largest collection of sci-fi,
comics, and graphic-illustration books. The proudly geeky staff
really knows what’s what. 840 Broadway at 13th Street (% 212-473-
1576; www.forbiddenplanetnyc.com; Subway: L, N, R, 4, 5, 6 to
14th Street/Union Square). (See the “Downtown Shopping” map.)
 Murder Ink: Claiming to be one of the oldest crime bookstores in
the world, this store is a gathering ground for crime-writing afi-
cionados. It also hosts numerous author readings. 2486 Broadway,
between 92nd and 93rd streets (% 212-362-8905; www.murderink.
com; Subway: 1, 2, 3 to 96th Street). (See the “Uptown Shopping”
map.)
 The Strand: A New York legend, The Strand is worth a visit for its
staggering “18 miles of books” as well as its extensive inventory of
review copies and bargain titles at up to 85 percent off list price.
828 Broadway at 12th Street (% 212-473-1452; www.strandbooks.
com; Subway: L, N, R, 4, 5, 6 to 14th Street/Union Square). Strand
Annex: 95 Fulton St. between William and Gold streets (% 212-732-
6070; Subway: 4, 5, 6 to Fulton Street). (See the “Downtown
Shopping” map.)
Edibles
 Dean & DeLuca: This upscale gourmet store in the heart of SoHo 
is a symbol of that area’s prosperity. The store features premier
quality across the board at premium prices. A small cafe up front
makes this place a great stop for a cappuccino break from SoHo
shopping. 560 Broadway at Prince Street (% 212-226-6800; www.
dean-deluca.com; Subway: N, R to Prince Street).
 Dylan’s Candy Bar: Dylan (daughter of Ralph) Lauren is one of the
co-owners of this new wonderland that would make Willy Wonka
proud. Located across the street from Bloomingdale’s, Dylan’s
stocks candy classics like Necco wafers, Charleston Chews, and
both of my favorite childhood chewing gums: Black Jack and Gold
Mine. 1011 Third Ave. at 60th Street (% 646-735-0078; www.dylans
candybar.com; Subway: 4, 5, 6, N, R to 59th Street). (See the
“Midtown Shopping” map.)
 Economy Candy Store: While Dylan’s is the new generation of
candy store, Economy Candy, open since 1937 and located in the
gentrified Lower East Side, is a blast from the past. Here, if you are
Chapter 12: Shopping in New York City 233

somewhat aged like your author, you will recognize treats from
your childhood like Hot Tamales, Bit O Honey candy, Kosher rock
candy, Atomic Fireballs, and Necco Wafers. 108 Rivington St.,
between Delancey and Norfolk streets. (% 212-254-1531; www.
economycandy.com; Subway: F to Delancey Street). (See the
“Downtown Shopping” map.)
 Fairway: You won’t find a better all-in-one market in Manhattan.
Here you can find the best and most modestly priced vegetables
and cheeses in the city. Fairway also carries gourmet items you
may find at Dean & Deluca, but at a fraction of the cost. The Harlem
store is huge and features a walk-in freezer complete with down
jackets provided for customers. 2127 Broadway between 74th and
75th streets (% 212-595-1888; www.fairwaymarket.com; Subway:
1, 2, 3, to 72nd Street). Also at 2328 12th Ave. at 132nd Street 
(% 212-234-3883; Subway: 1 to 125th Street). (See the “Uptown
Shopping” map.) A brand new location has opened in Red Hook,
Brooklyn (480–500 Van Brundt St., Brooklyn).
 Zabar’s: More than any other of New York’s gourmet food stores,
Zabar’s is an institution. This giant deli sells prepared foods, 
packaged goods from around the world, coffee beans, fresh breads,
and much more (no fresh veggies, though). You can also find an
excellent — and well-priced — collection of housewares and restau-
rant-quality cookware. Prepare yourself for serious crowds. 2245
Broadway at 80th Street (% 212-787-2000; Subway: 1 to 79th
Street). (See the “Uptown Shopping” map.)
Electronics
 B&H Photo & Video: Looking for a digital camera at a good price?
You really can’t do any better than B&H, the largest camera store in
the country. This camera superstore has everything from lenses to
darkroom equipment. The store can be somewhat intimidating, but
service is helpful. Just follow the signs to find whatever you’re
seeking. 420 Ninth Ave. at 34th Street (% 800-606-6969; www.bh
photovideo.com. Subway: A, C, E to 34th Street). (See the “Midtown
Shopping” map.)
B&H closes early on Fridays (2 p.m.) and isn’t open at all on
Saturdays or major Jewish holidays.
 J&R Music & Computer World: This block-long, Financial District
emporium is the city’s top discount computer, electronics, small
appliance, and office equipment retailer. Park Row at Ann Street,
opposite City Hall Park (% 800-426-6027 or 212-238-9000; www.
jandr.com; Subway: 2, 3 to Park Place; 4, 5, 6 to Brooklyn Bridge/
City Hall). (See the “Downtown Shopping” map.)
Part IV: Exploring New York City 
234

Museum Stores
 Metropolitan Museum of Art Store: Treasures from the museum’s
collection have been reproduced as jewelry, china, and other objets
d’art and sold in the museum’s stores. The range of art books is
dizzying, and upstairs is an equally comprehensive selection of
posters and inventive children’s toys. At numerous locations,
including 1000 Fifth Ave. at 82nd Street (% 212-570-3894; www.
metmuseum.org/store; Subway: 4, 5, 6 to 86th Street). Also at 15 
W. 49th St. (% 212-332-1360; Subway: B, D, F, V to 47–50 streets/
Rockefeller Center). (See the “Midtown Shopping” map.)
 MoMA Design Store: Across the street from the Museum of Modern
Art is this terrific shop, whose stock ranges from museum posters
and clever toys for kids to fully licensed reproductions of many of
the classics of modern design. The SoHo store is equally fabulous.

Music
 Colony Music Center: Housed in the legendary Brill Building, the
Tin Pan Alley of ’50s and ’60s pop, this place has been around since
1948. You can find a great collection of Broadway scores and cast
recordings; decades worth of recordings by pop song stylists both
legendary and obscure; the city’s best collection of sheet music
(including some hard-to-find international stuff); and a great selec-
tion of original theater and movie posters. 1619 Broadway at 49th

49th Street; 1 to 50th Street). (See the “Midtown Shopping” map.)
 House of Oldies: I skipped many a high school class to spend time in
this musty old store searching for doo-wop recordings. The store has
over one million vinyl records in stock in everything from R&B to
surf music. So if vinyl oldies are your thing, House of Oldies is your
dream come true. 35 Carmine St. at Bleecker (% 212-243-0500; www.

 Jazz Record Center: My friend the jazz buff from Paris swears by
this place as the best to find rare and out-of-print jazz records. In
addition to the extensive selection of CDs and vinyl (including 78s),
the store also offers videos, books, posters, magazines, photos, and
other memorabilia. 236 W. 26th St., 8th floor, between Seventh and
Eighth avenues (% 212-675-4480; www.jazzrecordcenter.com;
Subway: 1 to 28th Street). (See the “Midtown Shopping” map.)
 Tower Records: Even though this mighty chain has filed for bank-
ruptcy protection, it’s still my favorite music superstore, and I’m
pulling for its survival. Both main locations are huge multimedia
superstores brimming with an encyclopedic collection of music —
classical, jazz, rock, world, you name it. The downtown location
has a “bargain annex” and the 66th St. store (across from Lincoln
Center) has a breathtakingly huge and complete classical section.

Toys
 American Girl Place: Your princess will never forgive you if you
don’t take her to this gargantuan, 43,000-square-foot emporium for
little girls featuring a cafe, a bookstore, and a theater. If you come,
don’t forget to bring her favorite doll so it can get a makeover at
the store’s own doll salon. 609 Fifth Ave. at 49th Street (% 800-845-

 F.A.O Schwarz: After a year closed due to bankruptcy, this legend
reopened and now carries those hard-to-find and oh-so-expensive
items like Vespa scooters for older children, mini luxury cars like
Hummers and Jaguars, and serious karaoke machines. At the soda
fountain kids can load up on sugar to fuel their romp through the
magical store. 767 Fifth Ave. at 58th Street. (% 212-644-9400 ext.

Five Great Options
In This Chapter
 Exploring the best of New York in three, four, or five days
 Making the most of many museums
 Following the paths of history
I
’ve lived in New York for more than half my life, and I still haven’t
seen it all. That’s not because I don’t have the desire to see it all; it’s
just that in New York, you can’t see it all. So if you feel a bit overwhelmed
by all the options, I’ve laid out a few itineraries in this chapter that help
you focus on your interests and use your time most efficiently, while
giving you a good sampling of what New York has to offer. Remember,
these are just my ideas — feel free to tailor these itineraries to suit your
own schedule and taste.
New York in Three Days
Although your three-day visit may take place in the middle of the week,
I’m writing this chapter as if your three days are part of a long weekend.
Even if you’re constantly on the move, you just can’t cover all of New
York in 72 hours. This itinerary enables you to get a taste of New York —
just enough to make you want to come back for more. You’re always 
welcome.
Day one
Okay, start with getting a big picture of Manhattan. The best way to do
this is to take either a three-hour Circle Line Cruise or the two-hour
New York Waterways (see Chapter 11) full-island cruise. Both encircle
Manhattan from the water. You pass by the Statue of Liberty and Ellis
Island, see the Lower Manhattan skyline, go up the East River where 
you cruise under the Brooklyn Bridge, view the United Nations, cruise
around to the Hudson River where you pass the George Washington
Bridge, and then head back to dock on the West Side piers.

The ride on both cruises is generally calm, but if you’re like me and just
looking at the water from a boat begins to turn your face an unpleasant
shade of green, you may want to consider the land alternative: a double-
decker bus tour. Gray Line New York (see Chapter 11) offers many tour
options, but the one that passes most of the major attractions is the
downtown loop. The tour takes approximately two hours and shows you
Times Square, the Empire State Building, the Flatiron building, Rockefeller
Center, Greenwich Village, the Lower East Side, and Chinatown.
Be aware that the tour is only as good as the tour guide and, unfortu-
nately, some of the Gray Line double-decker bus tour guides will fill you
with misinformation. Also, if you’re here for a three-day weekend, hold
this tour for either Saturday or Sunday morning. The double-decker
buses don’t have special lanes, so they get stuck in traffic just like any-
thing else on wheels. Traffic is light on Saturday and Sunday mornings,
and you should cruise through the tour without any traffic hiccups.
You’re deposited on the West Side Highway around 42nd Street after
your morning tour (if you took the boat rather than the bus). Head over
a couple of blocks to Ninth Avenue and have lunch at one of Hell’s
Kitchen’s inexpensive ethnic restaurants. See Chapter 10 for some
restaurant suggestions. After lunch you can walk east across 42nd Street
to see many of the sights you couldn’t view from the boat. You pass
through the most famous crossroads in the world, 42nd and Broadway.
Make your way through the crowds and continue east where you hit
Bryant Park; if you see camera crews and tents in the park it means it’s
Fashion Week. On Fifth Avenue at 42nd is one of New York’s great struc-
tures: the New York Public Library. As you walk further east between
Park Avenue and Lexington Avenue, you see Grand Central Station,
another of New York’s architectural treasures, and at Lexington Avenue,
the city’s most magnificent Art Deco building, the Chrysler Building.
Finally, make your way back to Fifth Avenue and walk eight blocks south
to 34th Street. Look up — all the way to the top of the Empire State
Building. You’ve got your tickets already (order them online before 
you leave), so you don’t have to wait on line to get to the 86th-floor
Observatory, and check out the view from the tallest building in 
New York.
You’ve done a lot of walking, so head back to your hotel and rest for a
bit before setting out again. It’s Friday night and that means museums
are usually open late. You don’t have time to hit them all, so I recom-
mend The Metropolitan Museum of Art (see Chapter 11), where, not
only will you be in one of the world’s greatest museums, but on Friday
(and Sat) the Met’s beautiful Great Hall Balcony Bar is open for cocktails
with classical music from a string quartet. From May to October in good
weather, the lovely open-air Roof Garden Cafe overlooking Central Park
is also open.
After the museum and cocktails, you’ve got reservations at one of those
four-star restaurants run by a chef you’ve seen on television and on the
Chapter 13: Following an Itinerary: Five Great Options 239

cover of a famous magazine. Now you can judge for yourself what all the
fuss is about.
Day two
Make sure you have your hotel give you a wake-up call — you have
plenty of time to sleep on the flight home. Head down to Chinatown in
the morning and watch as the fish markets, and there are a lot of them,
prepare the day’s catch (some still flopping in the ice). Canal Street is
the area’s major thoroughfare, and by 11 a.m. on most days, especially
on Saturdays, the sidewalk is absolutely teeming; so the earlier you get
to Chinatown, the better. Have a late breakfast or early lunch at one of
the neighborhood’s great, cheap restaurants. (See Chapter 10 for tips.)
After eating, walk or get on the number 6 train at the Canal Street station
and take it one stop downtown to the Brooklyn Bridge/City Hall stop.
You’re going to see New York’s City Hall, but it’s the Brooklyn Bridge
that you want. If the weather is decent, follow the signs to the walkway
that takes you across that truly amazing structure. Don’t forget to turn
around for numerous photo ops with the New York skyline behind you.
After you reach Brooklyn and you’ve sufficiently worked off that meal in
Chinatown, you deserve a reward; head down to the river’s edge, under
the Brooklyn Bridge, and buy yourself an ice cream at the Brooklyn Ice
Cream Factory (see Chapter 10).
If you don’t want to walk back across the bridge, take the C train at High
Street back into Manhattan and get off at the Spring Street stop. At Spring
Street you’ve entered the chic, fashion-conscious neighborhood known
as SoHo. Traverse Spring Street and then up West Broadway to Prince
Street. With all the designer boutiques and funky (but expensive) stores
to explore, the going is going to be slow. You didn’t forget your plastic,
did you? Walking north across Houston, you enter Greenwich Village.
You’ll think you’re in old Europe with the narrow streets, quaint brown-
stones, and numerous cafes. Have a cappuccino at one of the cafes, or eat
an early dinner (look for early-bird and prix-fixe specials!), and then head
back to your hotel to freshen up. Tonight’s the night you’ve got tickets to
that Tony–award winning show on Broadway. This is also your chance to
take a peek at the neon spectacle of Times Square. After the show, if you
are still itching to move, hit one of the downtown dance clubs (see
Chapter 15), or if you’re hungry and just want a late bite, you have
numerous options to choose from.
Day three
For some reason, you wake up and miss hearing the sounds of birds
chirping like you hear back home. Not to worry — get on the subway
and make your way to New York’s green oasis, Central Park. But first
pick up some bagels and coffee for a breakfast alfresco. For hints on
where you can get the best bagels, see Chapter 10. The park is vast with
much to explore (see Chapter 11 for ideas); then amble over to the
Museum of Natural History, on Central Park West. The museum opens
Part IV: Exploring New York City 
240

at 10 a.m.; if you get there much later on a Sunday, expect to wait in line.
You won’t be able to see this entire phenomenal museum, but make sure
you see the dinosaurs or maybe the space show at the Rose Center for
Earth and Space. (For more on what to see, head to Chapter 11.)
After the museum, you may still have time to catch a gospel service
(assuming this is Sun) in Harlem, which you can follow up with a soul
food lunch (see Chapters 10 and 16). Or head across the park to the
eastside and walk Museum Mile where you can see museums like the
Guggenheim, the Frick, and the Whitney to name just a few (see
Chapter 11). You won’t have time to explore all of them, but find one
that interests you and make it your afternoon destination.
Have a light dinner at one of the city’s very good pizzerias or anywhere
else you like and then cap off your whirlwind New York weekend listen-
ing to some live music at a club or relax in a cozy lounge. See Chapter 15
for tips on where to find them.
New York in Five Days
Compared to three days in New York, you’re going to feel like five days is
a lifetime — until all the things you want to do begin to add up and you
realize even in five days you can’t do it all. Don’t worry, and try not to
stress. Remember, you’re never going to do it all. But the following five-
day itinerary should help give you an idea of what you can do, and it will
be plenty.
Day one
Start your day and your visit at the beginning — where the city was
born: Manhattan’s southern tip, New York’s oldest and most historic
precincts. Leave early to catch the morning’s first ferry to the Statue 
of Liberty and Ellis Island (Chapter 11). This ride will take up most of
your morning.
After you’re back on the island, if you didn’t arrange for tickets before you
left home, pop over to the downtown TKTS booth at South Street Seaport
(the line is usually shorter here than at the Times Square location) to pick
up some discounted tickets for a Broadway or Off-Broadway show
(something’s always available for the evening; see Chapter 14).
By now, you’re sure to need lunch, if you haven’t succumbed to your
hunger already. Do you want a leisurely meal or a quick snack? Check the
options listed in Chapter 10. Or hop the subway over to Brooklyn (the A
or C line will whisk you from Lower Manhattan over to the High Street
stop in minutes) and stroll back to Manhattan over the majestic Brooklyn
Bridge. The bridge and the views from it beg to be photographed. Or, if
you prefer, use the time to enjoy one of Lower Manhattan’s many historic
or cultural attractions, such as the insightful and moving Museum of
Jewish Heritage, a Living Memorial to the Holocaust; surprisingly
Chapter 13: Following an Itinerary: Five Great Options 241

diminutive Wall Street; or the National Museum of the American Indian,
housed in the stunning, 1907 Beaux Arts U.S. Customs House, which is
worth a visit for the architecture alone. See Chapter 11 for more informa-
tion on the city’s best architecture. Or just wander Battery Park with its
many memorials and stunning views of New York harbor.
Head back to your hotel to freshen up so you can enjoy a leisurely
dinner at one of the city’s hundreds of fantastic restaurants, see a
Broadway show, or stop at a club for some dancing or just to listen to
some jazz.
Day two
Spend the bulk of your day at one of the big museums: either the
Metropolitan Museum of Art or the American Museum of Natural
History. Both of these can easily fill a week of browsing, so you may
want to begin with a Highlights Tour. Don’t miss the dinosaurs or the
Space Show at the Natural History Museum’s Rose Center for Earth 
and Space.
After you’ve had enough of the museum, head into Central Park
(Chapter 11) to see some of its many highlights; both museums sit on 
its fringe. You’ve worked up a big appetite with all that walking, so plan
for another special dinner followed by the nightlife of your choice; the
options are limitless.
Day three
Start your morning with a full-island cruise with either Circle Line (three
hours) or New York Waterways (two hours), which circumnavigate
Manhattan and offer a fascinating perspective on the island. If you’re
strapped for time, opt for the 11⁄2-hour cruise that ferries you around
New York Harbor and halfway up the East River.
Spend the afternoon roaming some of the city’s downtown neighbor-
hoods: SoHo, the winding 19th-century streets of Greenwich Village,
and exotic Chinatown. Walk the prime thoroughfares, poke your head
into shops, or park yourself at a street-side cafe and just watch the
world go by. If you prefer to have a knowledgeable guide as you explore,
schedule a guided walking tour (see Chapter 11 for a list of various
tours, including free ones).
Stay downtown for the evening; catch dinner in a stylish (or authenti-
cally old-world) restaurant and follow dinner up with a trip to a cutting-
edge dance club or model-laden cocktail lounge. (See Chapter 15 for
recommendations.) Or if you’ve had enough of downtown, head back to
your hotel and freshen up, then head uptown for dinner; maybe order up
some down-home cooking in Harlem and wander over for some jazz at
the Lenox Lounge or St. Nick’s Pub.
Part IV: Exploring New York City 
242

Day four
Head over to Rockefeller Center and see if you can get on one of the
early NBC Tours (for information on times, ticket prices and reserva-
tions, call % 212-664-7174). While you are waiting for the tour to begin,
zip up to the Top of the Rock, where views, many feel, are better or com-
parable to those from the Empire State Building. Then make your way to
the nearby MoMA. If it is a weekday morning, you might actually see the
works on exhibit at this amazing and amazingly popular museum rather
than having to peer around a mass of bodies for a peek at them. 
After you’re done, walk eight blocks to Grand Central Terminal (the
walk is pleasant on a nice day) to admire that marvelous Beaux Arts
monument to modern transportation. The dining concourse on the
lower level gives you some very good lunch options.
If you never made it to the Top of the Rock, head down to the Empire
State Building (flip to Chapter 11 for details) to see the view from the
86th-floor observation deck of New York’s tallest building and ultimate
landmark skyscraper. Spend the rest of the afternoon browsing a few of
the Big Apple’s brilliant smaller museums. Take in the Frick Collection,
the Whitney, or the recently renovated Morgan Library. Or, if you prefer,
use the afternoon to stroll up Madison Avenue and gawk, or exercise your
credit line, at the staggeringly expensive shops.
Enjoy another evening at the theater, or catch a performance at Lincoln
Center, Carnegie Hall, or one of the city’s other terrific performing-arts
institutions. Don’t forget the innovative Brooklyn Academy of Music;
it’s easy to get to by subway with many of the major lines stopping
nearby (see Chapter 14).
Day five
Use the morning to explore one of the major attractions you’ve missed
thus far. If you spent day two at the Met, spend today at the American
Museum of Natural History. If you made it to the top of the Empire
State Building, but not the Top of the Rock, now’s your chance to com-
pare views. Or go see Frank Lloyd Wright’s iconic Guggenheim Museum.
Tour the nerve center of international relations: the United Nations. If
you haven’t seen Central Park yet, go now; you cannot leave New York
without visiting it. If you’ve already done all the above, maybe today is
the day you leave Manhattan for the Bronx and make a stop at the fabu-
lous Bronx Zoo or the Bronx Botanical Garden. Or head to Brooklyn for
the sometimes-controversial Brooklyn Art Museum (see Chapter 11).
In the evening, celebrate the end of a great vacation with some live
music. Flip to Chapter 15 for a rundown of the city’s nightlife offerings. 
A night of jazz at the legendary Village Vanguard, or rock at Arlene
Grocery, or maybe some Haitian compass music at S.O.B.’s, makes a
very festive close, as does a night of laughs at one of the city’s legendary
Chapter 13: Following an Itinerary: Five Great Options 243

comedy clubs, such as Carolines or the Comedy Cellar. Or, for the ulti-
mate in New York elegance, dress to the nines and opt for a night of
champagne and cabaret at the venerable Cafe Carlyle or Feinstein’s at
the Regency. If you want the velvet rope experience, head to one of the
city’s hottest dance clubs. This is your last night, so make it memorable.
New York for Museum Mavens
You would easily need (at least) five days to see the many museums and
galleries in New York. But even if you’re a maven, that’s a bit extreme.
Here’s my stress-free two-day museum itinerary.
Start at the busiest and most extensive museum, the Metropolitan
Museum of Art. Plan to arrive at the museum around opening time 
(9:30 a.m.) to avoid the crowds. Give yourself a minimum of two hours
for your visit. Remember, the Met is closed on Mondays. From the Met,
stroll up Museum Mile and try to decide if you want to go inside that
funny-looking building called the Guggenheim, or head south from the
Met to the Frick or the Whitney or any of the other fine museums in 
the area. But you won’t have time to visit more than one before your
hunger wins out. You can hit a branch of El Paso Taqueria on 97th
Street, between Park and Lexington avenues, or take a taxi up to Patsy’s
Pizzeria on First Avenue and 116th Street for the best pizza in New York.
See Chapter 10 for more restaurant information.
After lunch, head to 53rd Street, between Fifth and Sixth avenues, and
visit the jewel-like Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) (see Chapter 11). 
If you still have the time and energy, just up the street is the stunning
American Folk Art Museum (also detailed in Chapter 11). If you’re truly
dedicated, you can try to make it to west Chelsea in time to hit the gal-
leries there, and then eat at one of the innumerable restaurants nearby.
After a night dreaming of gilded treasures, take the subway out to
Brooklyn for part two of your museum-going adventure and the second-
largest museum after the Met, the Brooklyn Museum of Art. You’re in
Brooklyn and you’ve got all morning so give yourself three hours at this
wonderful museum.
Take the train back to Manhattan and, if you didn’t get to Chelsea for a bit
of gallery hopping, now’s your chance. Or check out the New Museum of
Contemporary Art in SoHo. In either neighborhood, you can visit galleries
galore. For more information about museums in New York, see Chapter 11.
New York for Families with Kids
New York, despite its gritty reputation, is a wonderland for children. Start
your family vacation at the great Museum of Natural History. Promising
the little ones a peek at Barney, proceed directly to the fourth floor and
Part IV: Exploring New York City 
244

the Dinosaur exhibit. Don’t worry, after they view the real dinosaurs, they
may forget all about that sugary purple one. After they’ve had enough
dinosaurs, take the brood to the Rose Center for Earth and Space,
whose four-story-tall planetarium sphere hosts the excellent Robert
Redford–narrated Space Show that will awe all of you. The museum is
right across from Central Park, the perfect place for a picnic lunch with
the family. Children can explore much in Central Park: playgrounds
galore, boat rides, the Central Park Zoo, the Carousel, and ice-skating. 
To do it all takes a day in itself.
After lunch, take the C train at Central Park West and 81st Street down-
town to Times Square, where the kids can gawk at all the lights, familiar
stores, arcades, and junk food that the reinvented tourist zone has to
offer. If you have little ones, take them to the Toys “R” Us superstore
(see Chapter 12) where they can get a ride on the store’s free indoor
Ferris wheel. You’re all probably famished by now, so treat the family to
dinner at Virgil’s Real BBQ or Carmine’s, both extremely kid-friendly
(see Chapter 10).
The next day, head over to the Hudson River piers in the West 40s and
take either the three-hour Circle Line cruise around Manhattan or the
90-minute New York Waterways Harbor Cruise. Both offer a different
perspective on some of the city’s greatest attractions like the Statue 
of Liberty, Ellis Island, the Brooklyn Bridge, and the United Nations.
For lunch, the pizza at John’s Pizzeria, just off Times Square, can make
any kid happy. After lunch work your way to 34th and Fifth and the
Empire State Building. Because you’ve already bought tickets (see
Chapter 11), you won’t have to wait in line, and you and your family are
quickly whizzed up to the 86th-floor observatory where you experience
the same view King Kong had when he climbed to the top of the city’s
tallest building. From the observation deck, look downtown and tell the
kids that is where they’re going for dinner: to Chinatown where the con-
stant commotion, street vendors, flopping fish, and all-around exotic feel
may excite the children as much as it does you. After the excitement of
the day you’re all going to be famished and ready for a big, communal,
and inexpensive dinner at one of Chinatown’s many restaurants.
After dinner, take the 6 train uptown to 14th Street/Union Square where
you will switch to the number 4 express train. Stay on the train until you
come out of the tunnel and see the bright lights of Yankee Stadium. Your
stop is 161st Street, Yankee Stadium, and you’re here to see the most
celebrated franchise in all sports play, the New York Yankees.
If you have another day with the family, take a poll from the kids on what
they want to do. Return to Central Park? Head up to the Bronx Zoo? Or 
out to Queens and the NY Hall of Science. Visit a few museums like the
New York Transit Museum, the Skyscraper Museum, or the Children’s
Museum? Check out South Street Seaport? Explore the activities of
Chelsea Piers? Don’t worry. With any of these choices, you can’t go wrong.
Chapter 13: Following an Itinerary: Five Great Options 245

It’s always good to have a Plan B in case it rains (or snows). The weather
may very well determine how much walking you can do (or want to do).
New York for History Buffs
The history of most cities is written in its neighborhoods. New York is no
exception. Try out this itinerary and visit some of the city’s historic neigh-
borhoods to get a good feel for the character and growth of New York.
Start in Lower Manhattan, at the extreme southern tip of the island of
Manhattan. At Battery Park, you can see Castle Clinton, completed in
1808. Just a short walk away is the gorgeous U.S. Customs House, built in
1907, which houses the National Museum of the American Indian at the
George Gustav Heye Center.
Though most of the lower Manhattan historic sights are within walking
distance, the Alliance for New York offers free bus service on their
Downtown Connection bus (see Chapter 8 for details).
Next on your walking/bus tour should be historic Wall Street and the
Federal Hall National Monument (circa 1842), along with the famous
statue of George Washington. Also on Wall Street is Trinity Church, built
in 1846 and beautifully preserved.
For a taste of very modern and very tragic history, just a few blocks up
from Trinity Church you can see the huge, soon-to-be-built-upon open
lot that, before September 11, 2001, was the site of the World Trade
Center. Almost directly across the street and miraculously spared from
the terrorist attacks is the St. Paul’s Chapel, built in 1766 and part of the
Trinity Church, where George Washington was a frequent worshiper.
From here, you want to get on one of those free buses and take it east to
the South Street Seaport and Museum where the 18th- and 19th-century
buildings lining the cobbled streets and alleyways have been impeccably
restored. You can also hit the very modern mall-like shopping center and
numerous restaurants here if you’ve had too much history or just want
to take a lunch break.
After lunch, you can head to another historic downtown neighborhood,
the Lower East Side, which is a tenement neighborhood where many
immigrants — notably Eastern European Jews — settled back in the mid-
to late-19th century. Delancey Street and historic Orchard Street are
the main thoroughfares to explore. And to get the best taste of what life
was like for the immigrants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, visit
the Lower East Side Tenement Museum (see Chapter 11). Then treat
yourself to some great ice cream at Il Laboratorio del Gelato next door
or head to Houston Street and Katz’s Delicatessen for a genuine New
York egg cream (see Chapter 10).
Part IV: Exploring New York City 
246

Take a break and rest a bit before heading out to your next neighbor-
hood, Greenwich Village. The Village has always been the domain of the
unconventional; the place for radical thinkers; the haunt of literary fig-
ures like Henry James, Eugene O’Neill, and Dylan Thomas. Artists like
Edward Hopper and Jackson Pollack and the famous beatniks Allen
Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, and William Burroughs lived and hung out in
Greenwich Village. Unlike other parts of the city, the Village is not laden
with historical landmarks. Its landmarks are its streets, alleyways, and
brownstone blocks.
The physical center of the Village is Washington Square Park, located in
the heart of New York University, where along with some serious chess
players, some entertaining street performers, and a few determined drug
dealers, you can see the famous Washington Square Arch. The heart of
beatnik society was centered on Bleecker and MacDougal Streets. Stop
and have an espresso at one of the many cafes in the area; the people-
watching doesn’t get any better. The West Village around Christopher
Street is the center of the pioneering gay community where you find
some quaint boutiques and more cafes.
Dinnertime should be approaching, and maybe you’ve planned ahead
and have reservations at Mas or A.O.C. Bedford, or maybe you just want
to try one of those pizzas from Lombardi’s. For more ideas on restau-
rants you may want to check out, see Chapter 10. No matter when you
get out of dinner, the Village will still be buzzing with activity. You may
want to hear some jazz at the venerable Village Vanguard club or catch a
comedy show at the Comedy Cellar (see Chapter 16 for more on clubs
and bars), or check out the Tower Records at 4th and Broadway (or its
Bargain Annex right next to it).
Continue your historic neighborhood itinerary the next day on the
Upper West Side. The Upper West Side has a history of liberalism and of
being a home to musicians. It’s only fitting that Lincoln Center, at 64th
Street and Broadway, is the unofficial gateway to the Upper West Side.
From Lincoln Center cut over to Central Park West and you see the
grandeur of that boulevard lined with Beaux Arts apartment houses, the
oldest being the Dakota, built in 1884 on Central Park West and 72nd
Street. The Dakota has the infamous distinction of being not only the
location for the Roman Polanski film Rosemary’s Baby, but also where
John Lennon, who lived there with Yoko Ono, was shot and killed. Other
famous residents of the Dakota have included Leonard Bernstein, Lauren
Bacall, and Judy Garland.
Walk west across 72nd Street to Broadway where you can see the 
area’s other magnificent residence, the Ansonia at 73rd and Broadway.
Musicians such as Caruso, Toscanini, and Igor Stravinsky, to name just 
a few, have called this building home.
If you’re hungry, grab some lunch at Zabar’s (see Chapter 10), the area’s
most famous gourmet food store, and take it either to Riverside Park for
Chapter 13: Following an Itinerary: Five Great Options 247

a picnic lunch overlooking the Hudson River or walk a few blocks east 
to Central Park. If you choose to go east, you may want to stop at the
New-York Historical Society at Central Park West and 77th Street (see
Chapter 11 for details). If you choose west, stroll up Riverside Drive,
which, like Central Park West, features some of the city’s most stately
apartment houses.
After lunch head up to Harlem where the wealthiest New Yorkers lived in
the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Many of the Harlem mansions still
stand and are impeccably preserved. On 130th Street between Fifth and
Lenox avenues, you can see a series of 28 redbrick townhouses, known
as the Astor Row Houses, which date back to the early 1880s. On 139th
Street between Adam Clayton Powell Jr. and Frederick Douglass boule-
vards sits the impressive Strivers’ Row, where hardly a brick has
changed among the gorgeous neo-Italian Renaissance town houses that
were built in 1890. After the original white owners moved out, these
lovely houses attracted the cream of Harlem, “strivers” like Eubie Blake
and W. C. Handy.
Handsome brownstones, limestone townhouses, and row houses are
sprinkled atop Sugar Hill, 145th to 155th streets between St. Nicholas and
Edgecombe avenues, named for the “sweet life” enjoyed by its residents.
Finally, head up to 160th Street, east of St. Nicholas Avenue, to see
Manhattan’s oldest surviving house, the 1765-built Morris-Jumel Mansion
(65 Jumel Terrace; % 212-923-8008; www.morrisjumel.org; Open:
Wed–Sun 10 a.m.–4 p.m. for tours).
All that history works up a major appetite, so stay in Harlem for dinner;
you can’t go wrong with the soul food buffet at Charles’ Southern Style
Kitchen (see Chapter 10 for a description).

A
s the song says, New York is the “city that never
sleeps.” And with such an embarrassment of nighttime
riches to choose from, New York truly is an insomniac’s
dream. In the chapters that follow, I go over some of the
venues for theater, dance, and music that you may want to
visit. I also give you a roundup of clubs and bars where you
can kick back and relax or dance the night away.

N
o other city rivals New York in the breadth and scope of the 
performing arts offered. From the incredible range of theater,
opera, dance, and symphony to live rock and jazz, the bounty is almost
too full. Your biggest problem is going to be choosing among the many
temptations.
Getting the Inside Scoop
For the latest, most comprehensive nightlife listings, from theater and
performing arts to live rock, jazz, and dance club coverage, Time Out
New York (www.timeoutny.com) is my favorite weekly source; a new
issue hits newsstands every Thursday. The free weekly Village Voice
(www.villagevoice.com), the city’s legendary alterna-paper, is avail-
able late Tuesday downtown and early Wednesday throughout the rest
of the city. The arts and entertainment coverage couldn’t be more exten-
sive, and just about every live music venue advertises its shows here.
The New York Times (www.nytoday.com) features terrific entertain-
ment coverage, particularly in the two-part Friday “Weekend” section.
The cabaret, classical music, and theater guides are particularly useful.
Other great weekly sources are The New Yorker (www.newyorker.com),
in its “Goings on About Town” section; and New York magazine (www.ny
mag.com), whose “Cue” features the latest happenings.
NYC/Onstage (% 212-768-1818; www.tdf.org) is a recorded service pro-
viding complete schedules, descriptions, and other details on theater and
the performing arts. The focus is more toward theater, but NYC/Onstage 
is also a good source for chamber and orchestral music (including all
Lincoln Center events), dance, opera, cabaret, and family entertainment.

A little research can get you an array of information and reviews of current
shows. The New York Times is a good source for the scoop on big thea-
ter shows; the Village Voice is strong on alternative culture. The listings
in New York magazine, the New Yorker, and Time Out New York regularly
offer information about both mainstream shows and those off the beaten
path. The following Web sites also offer valuable theater information:
 Applause: www.applause-tickets.com
 CitySearch New York: www.newyork.citysearch.com
 NYC & Company: www.nycvisit.com
 Ticketmaster: www.ticketmaster.com
 Theatermania: www.theatermania.com
To get information by phone, call Broadway Line (% 888-BROADWAY
or 212-302-4111) or the Off-Broadway Theater Information Center 
(% 212-575-1423), the two official theater resources in New York. You
also can call NYC/On Stage (% 212-768-1818) or NYC & Company 
(% 800-NYC-VISIT or 800-692-8474).
Taking in New York Theater
New York’s theater scene is second to none. With so much breadth and
depth, and so many wide-open alternatives, just keeping up with it is
exhausting as well as exhilarating, especially for theater buffs. Broadway,
of course, gets the most ink and the most airplay, and deservedly so.
Broadway is where you find the big stage productions, from crowd-
pleasing warhorses like The Lion King to the phenomenally successful
shows like The Producers. But smaller “alternative” theater has become
popular both commercially and critically, too. With bankable stars on
stage, crowds lining up for hot tickets, and hits popular enough to gener-
ate major-label cast albums, Off-Broadway isn’t just for culture vultures.
Helping to assure the recent success of the New York theater scene is
the presence of Hollywood stars like Hugh Jackman, Julia Roberts,
Matthew Broderick, Melanie Griffith, Liev Schreiber, and Alec Baldwin.
But keep in mind that stars’ runs on stage are often limited, and tickets
for their shows tend to sell out fast.
If you hear that an actor you’d like to see is coming to the New York
stage, don’t put off your travel and ticket-buying plans. (The box office
can tell you how long a star is contracted for a role.)
Figuring out the Broadway basics
The terms Broadway, Off-Broadway, and Off-Off-Broadway refer to
theater size, pay scales, and other details, not location — or, these days,
even star wattage. Most of the Broadway theaters are in Times Square,
around the thoroughfare the scene is named for, but not directly on it.

Instead, you can find theaters dotting the side streets that intersect
Broadway, mostly in the mid-40s between Sixth and Eighth avenues
(44th and 45th streets in particular), but also running north as far as
53rd Street.
Off-Broadway, on the other hand, could be anything and anywhere. Off-
Off-Broadway shows tend to be more avant-garde, experimental, and/or
nomadic (and also have the cheapest ticket prices). Off- and Off-Off-
Broadway productions tend to be based downtown, but pockets of per-
formance spaces exist in Midtown and on the Upper West Side as well.
Broadway shows tend to keep pretty regular schedules. Eight perform-
ances a week is the norm, with evening shows on Tuesday through

Culture for free: Shakespeare 
in Central Park
A New York institution since 1957, Shakespeare in the Park is as much a part of a New
York summer as fireworks on the 4th of July. Shakespeare in the Park is the brainchild
of the late Joseph Papp, former director of the Public Theater, who came up with the
idea of staging two Shakespeare plays each summer at the open-air Delacorte Theater
in Central Park. Best of all, and the reason Shakespeare in the Park has become an
institution, is that the performances are free.
Budget cuts in the last few years have reduced the number of shows offered from two
to one, usually a revival of a Shakespeare play featuring a large company, including
at least one or more “names” from film and television. The production runs from the
end of June to early August. Depending on the star power of the cast, tickets can be
quite scarce. In years past, Much Ado About Nothing featured Jimmy Smits, Sam
Waterston, and Kristen Johnston; Morgan Freeman and Tracey Ullman starred in
Taming of the Shrew; and Patrick Stewart starred in The Tempest, which later gradu-
ated to a successful Broadway run.
The Public Theater also presents music at the Delacorte: two weeks of musical per-
formances called “Joe’s Pub in the Park,” an outdoor version of the artists featured at
Joe’s Pub, the intimate music venue at the Public Theater.
Roughly 1,800 tickets are distributed at the Delacorte on a first-come, first-served basis
(only two per person) for the plays, starting at 1 p.m. on the day of each performance.
But keep in mind that people start lining up at least two or three hours in advance, so
bring a book or some refreshments and be prepared to wait. Tickets are also available
between 1 and 3 p.m. on the day of the performance at the Public Theater, 425
Lafayette St., between Astor Place and East 4th Street in the East Village (the lines get
long there, too).
For more information about Shakespeare in the Park, contact the Public Theater 
(% 212-539-8750; www.publictheater.org), or call the Delacorte at % 212-861-
7277.

Saturday, plus matinees on Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday. Evening
shows usually start at 8 p.m., while matinees are usually at 2 p.m. on
Wednesday and Saturday, and 3 p.m. on Sunday, but schedules can vary,
especially Off-Broadway. Shows usually start on the dot, or within a few
minutes of starting time; if you arrive late, you may have to wait until
after the first act to take your seat — so be on time and you won’t miss
any of the show.
Getting theater tickets
Ticket prices for Broadway shows vary dramatically. Expect to pay a lot
for good seats; the high end for any given show is likely to be between
$60 and $100 or more. The cheapest end of the price range can be as low
as $20 or as high as $50, depending on the theater configuration. If you’re
buying tickets at the very low end of the available range, be aware that
you may be buying obstructed-view seats. If all tickets are the same price
or the range is small, you can pretty much count on all the seats being
pretty good.
Chapter 14: Applauding the Cultural Scene 255
Kids like theater, too!
And they have lots of venues and shows to choose from in New York City.
 The New Victory Theater, 229 W. 42nd St., between Seventh and Eighth avenues
(% 646-223-3020; www.newvictory.org), is the city’s first full-time, family-
oriented performing arts center and has hosted companies ranging from the Trinity
Irish Dance Company to the astounding Flaming Idiots, who juggle everything from
fire and swords to bean-bag chairs.
 Called “the best children’s theater in the country” by Newsweek magazine, The
Paper Bag Players (% 212-663-0390; www.paperbagplayers.org), perform
funny tales for children ages 4 to 9 in a set made from bags and boxes at Hunter
College’s Sylvia and Danny Kaye Playhouse, 68th Street between Park and
Lexington avenues (% 212-772-4448). Shows are performed in the winter only,
and if you can’t make it to the Kaye, call the players to inquire whether they’re
staging other performances around town.
 TADA! Youth Theater, 15 W. 28th St., between Fifth Avenue and Broadway (% 212-
252-1619; www.tadatheater.com), is a fun youth ensemble that performs musi-
cals and plays with a multiethnic perspective for kids, teens, and their families.
 The Swedish Cottage Marionette Theatre (% 212-988-9093; www.central
park.org) puts on marionette shows for kids at its 19th-century Central Park
theater throughout the year. Reservations are a must.
 Yes it’s the same David Mamet who writes those hardboiled movies and plays, but
he shows his softer side with acclaimed youth productions as part of his Atlantic
Theater Company, 336 W. 20th St., between Eighth and Ninth avenues (% 212-645-
8015; www.atlantictheater.org), which Mamet co-founded with Academy
Award–nominated actor William H. Macy.

One of my many pet peeves is that despite having to pay so much for a
show, the theaters haven’t installed more comfortable seating (espe-
cially in the older theaters, which can date from the early 20th century,
when people were smaller). I often feel like my knees are up to my chest
at most of these theaters — and those are orchestra seats. Consider
yourself forewarned.
Off-Broadway and Off-Off-Broadway shows tend to be cheaper than
Broadway shows, with tickets often as low as $10 or $15. However, seats
for the most established shows and those with star power can command
prices as high as $50.
If you’ve already decided on a show to see before you leave for your trip,
just have your credit card in hand and contact any of the following ticket
agencies by phone or on the Web (you usually encounter a service fee in
addition to the cost of the tickets).
Some of these theater and ticket organizations have lists of discounted
shows, the latest theater news and reviews, and member bulletin boards
where you can ask for recommendations. If you’re planning to get to 
as many shows as you can, it’s worth it to register with a service like
Theatermania.com, Playbill.com, or Broadway.com to access discounts
and subscribe their e-mail newsletters.
 Applause: www.applause-tickets.com; also offers discounts
 Broadway.com: www.broadway.com; also offers dinner packages
and gift certificates
 Manhattan Concierge: % 800-NY-SHOWS or 212-239-2591; www.
manhattanconcierge.com; a ticket broker that can sell you good
tickets to almost anything (including concerts and sporting events);
expect to pay a service charge
 Playbill.com: www.playbill.com; the online presence of the com-
pany that distributes the familiar programs with the yellow logo in
theaters; also offers packages, industry news, and photos and
videos of shows
 Tele-charge: % 800-432-7250 or 212-239-6200; www.telecharge.com
 Theatermania: % 212-352-0255; www.theatermania.com; an
excellent source for Off- and Off-Off Broadway, as well as full-price
and discounted Broadway tickets
 Ticketmaster: % 212-307-4100; www.ticketmaster.com
If you didn’t buy your tickets in advance, you can buy same-day tickets
at the following outlets:
Part V: Living It Up After Dark: New York City Nightlife 
256

 TKTS sells discounted (up to 50 percent) tickets as they become
available from theaters. A (temporary) booth is located just outside
the Marriott Marquis hotel on W. 46th St. between Broadway and
Eighth Avenue in the Theater District. (Open: daily from 3–8 p.m., 
10 a.m.–2 p.m. on Wed and Sat for matinees, and Sun from 11 a.m.–
6:30 p.m.) The permanent booth, currently undergoing renovations
and scheduled to reopen in December 2006, is located in the heart of
the Theater District in Duffy Square at 47th and Broadway. A booth 
is also open downtown at Pier 17 at South Street Seaport (Open:
Mon–Sat 11 a.m.–6 p.m. and Sat 11 a.m.–3:30 p.m.; at this location
only, matinee tickets must be purchased the day before the show).
For the most up-to-date ticket information, consult www.tkts.com.
Before you visit a physical ticket booth, keep in mind that long
lines are the norm, and you’re not guaranteed to get tickets for a
specific show. Also note that tickets for a popular show may be
available because the cast for that day changed, which is not the
best scenario if you have your heart set on seeing a particular pro-
duction or actor.
 For same-day advance tickets at regular prices for most shows, visit
the two official booths run by the League of American Theaters and
Producers: the Broadway Ticket Center inside the Times Square
Visitors Center (Broadway at 46th Street; % 888-BROADWAY or
212-302-4111; Open: daily 8 a.m.–8 p.m.) and the Off-Broadway
Theater Information Center (251 W. 45th St., between Broadway
and Eighth Avenue; % 212-575-1423; Open: Tues–Thurs 12–8 p.m.,
Fri–Sat 12 p.m.–10 p.m., Sun–Mon 12–6 p.m.).
You also can get tickets after you arrive in the city by calling one of the
telephone services listed earlier in this chapter, by asking the concierge
at your hotel, or by using one of the numerous ticket brokers, whose list-
ings you can find in newspapers and in the phone book. According to
New York City law, these brokers are only supposed to charge a $5 fee or
a 10 percent commission, whichever is less. However, New Jersey has no
such law, and a lot of the brokers are based there. Ask about the fee up
front, because tickets to a very hot show can go for as much as double
or more the face value.
Another option is to call the box office of the theater where the show 
is playing to ask whether they have any tickets available, because they
often do. Some long-running shows run special promotions, so it pays 
to inquire when you call. As a last resort, remember that a cheap way to
get a seat is not to have one: Standing room is available at some theaters
for about $20.
Make the rounds of Broadway theaters at about 6 p.m., when unclaimed
house seats are made available to the public. These tickets — reserved
for VIPs, friends of the cast, the press, or industry professionals — offer
great seats and are sold at face value. (If you’re with someone, tell the
salesperson that you don’t have to sit together. Single seats are usually
easier to come by than pairs at the last minute).
Chapter 14: Applauding the Cultural Scene 257

Also, note that Monday is often a good day to score big-name show tick-
ets. Although most theaters are dark on that day, some of the most
sought-after choices aren’t. Locals are likely to stay at home on the first
night of the workweek, so the odds of getting tickets are in your favor.
Your chances of getting tickets are always better on weeknights or for
Wednesday matinees, rather than on weekends (but do check and see if
the Big Star is on, rather than the understudy).
Venues That Break the Mold
New York is blessed with a number of amazing venues to hear and see
the performing arts. Some, like Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall, are 
so famous that they’re household names around the globe, while the

Catching a little pre-theater dinner
You want to eat before you go to the theater for a number of reasons. If you try to hold
out until after the show ends, your hunger may distract you from the drama in front of
you. You may end up thinking more about whether you want a steak or a taco during
the performance. Also, you don’t want to disturb other theatergoers with the rumblings
emitting from your empty stomach. So plan to eat something before you go. Many
restaurants in the Theater District have pre-theater prix-fixe specials, and all of them
are expert at serving you quickly. Consider these suggestions.
 Daniel Boulud’s casual cafe, db Bistro Moderne, 55 W. 44th St., between Fifth and
Sixth avenues (% 212-391-2400), is the home of the famous $29 hamburger. If you
don’t want a hamburger made with ground short ribs and shaved black truffles, the
restaurant also offers a three-course pre-theater dinner for $45.
 My favorite Greek restaurant, Molyvos, 871 Seventh Ave., between 55th and 56th
streets (% 212-582-7500), is the perfect place for a meal before a concert at
nearby Carnegie Hall. The three-course pre-theater prix fixe at Molyvos is $35.
 My favorite Times Square restaurant, Virgil’s Real BBQ, 152 W. 44th St., between
6th and 7th avenues (% 212-921-9494), is just a short stroll from most Broadway
theaters. Because of the pre-theater dining rush, reservations are an absolute
must.
If you just want a quick, inexpensive, and good meal before your show, you may want
to consider several options. You can’t beat the Ramen noodles at Sapporo, 152 W. 49th
St., just east of Seventh Avenue, where a meal won’t cost you much more than $10. At
the cozy, very good Siam Inn, 854 Eighth Ave., between 51st and 52nd streets, the Thai
food is the best in the neighborhood.
Always inform the staff at sit-down restaurants that you have theater tickets, and they
make sure you’re out the door in time to make the opening curtain.
For more information on all the above restaurants, see Chapter 10.

Brooklyn Academy of Music, though not as famous worldwide, certainly
should be.
The Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts
This celebrated complex, shown in the “Lincoln Center” map, extends
over four blocks on the Upper West Side. It hosts an extraordinary range
of productions, from opera to film to dance to classical music, in the fol-
lowing performance spaces:
 Metropolitan Opera House (% 212-362-6000; www.metopera.org)
is home to the Metropolitan Opera Company (see the “Opera” sec-
tion later in this chapter) and the American Ballet Theater (see
“Dance” later in this chapter). It also showcases visiting ballet per-
formers from around the world.
 Avery Fisher Hall (% 212-721-6500) is the seat of the New York
Philharmonic (see “Classical Music” later in this chapter), but it
also hosts many important seasonal musical events organized by
Lincoln Center, such as Mostly Mozart, and concerts performed by
students of the famed Juilliard School.
 New York State Theater is home to the New York City Opera (see
“Opera”) and the New York City Ballet (see “Dance”).
 Alice Tully Hall (% 212-875-5000) hosts the Chamber Music Society
of Lincoln Center (% 212-875-5788; www.chamberlinc.org).
 Walter Reade Theater (% 212-875-5600) is home to the Film
Society of Lincoln Center (www.filmlinc.com), which sponsors
the New York Film Festival and other events.
Chapter 14: Applauding the Cultural Scene 259
Jazz at Lincoln Center 
I’m usually a stickler for accuracy, but I’ll make an exception for Jazz at Lincoln Center,
which can no longer be found at Lincoln Center. A few years ago, JALC moved about
four blocks south to the Time Warner Center at Broadway and 60th Street on Columbus
Circle (% 212/258-9800; www.jalc.org). Though the move was slightly downtown,
this was definitely a move up. Its complex on the fourth floor of Time Warner’s north-
ern tower features two amazing performance spaces, a jazz club, a mini jazz hall of
fame, and a 7,000-square-foot atrium with views of Central Park. 
The largest of the three venues is the Rose Theater, where you might see the Lincoln
Center Jazz Orchestra, led by Wynton Marsalis, performing the swing music of Thad
Jones. Acoustics are perfect and seating is spacious. The glittering jewel of the Center,
however, is the Allen Room with its 4,500-square-foot glass backdrop behind the main
stage offering glittering views of Central Park and the Manhattan night sky. Hard to
believe that what was once played in smoky basements is now presented in venues
as spectacular and opulent as these.

260
 The Juilliard School (% 212-769-7406; www.juilliard.org)
hosts many concerts — mostly classical but not only — as well 
as other performances. The quality is excellent and the prices are
very attractive — many concerts are free. The maximum charge for
a ticket is about $15. Check the bulletin board in the hall, or call for
current productions. The school also sponsors many free outdoor
concerts in the summer.
 Vivian Beaumont Theater (% 212-362-7600) is the city’s northern-
most Broadway theater and shares a building with Mitzi E.
Newhouse Theater, an important off-Broadway establishment.
They host a variety of shows. Together, they form the Lincoln
Center Theater (www.lct.org).
The Center also has two outdoor spaces: a central plaza with a huge
fountain and Damrosch Park toward the back. In summer, the outdoor
spaces host some great series, such as Midsummer Night’s Swing in
July and Lincoln Center Out-of-Doors in August, as well as many free

concerts. Summer is the season of special series indoors, too — such as
the JVC Jazz Festival, Mostly Mozart, and the Lincoln Center Festival —
because it is the resident companies’ time off.
To get the Center’s calendar, check its Web site at www.lincolncenter.
org, which also has links to each of the companies and organizations that
belong to the Center. You also can send a self-addressed stamped enve-
lope (or a label and a stamp) to Lincoln Center Calendar, 70 Lincoln
Center Plaza, New York, NY 10023-6583, or call % 212-546-2656 for infor-
mation about the current shows.
If you want to use public transportation to get to the Center, take the 1
train to the 66th Street/Lincoln Center stop, or take one of the following
buses: M104 (running east/west on 42nd Street, north on Sixth Avenue,
and south on Broadway), M5 and M7 (running up Sixth Avenue and
Broadway), or M66 (across town running west on 67th Street).
Carnegie Hall
Perhaps the world’s most famous performance space, Carnegie Hall
offers everything from grand classics to the music of Ravi Shankar. The
Isaac Stern Auditorium, the 2,804-seat main hall, welcomes visiting
orchestras from across the country and around the world. Many of the
world’s premier soloists and ensembles give recitals here. The legendary
hall is both visually and acoustically brilliant; don’t miss an opportunity
to experience it if there’s something on the schedule that interests you.
Also part of Carnegie Hall is the intimate 268-seat Weill Recital Hall, usu-
ally used to showcase chamber music and vocal and instrumental recitals.
Carnegie Hall has also reclaimed the ornate underground 650-seat Zankel
Concert Hall, which was occupied by a movie theater for 38 years.
Carnegie Hall is located at 881 Seventh Ave. at 57th Street. For schedule
and ticket information, check the Web site at www.carnegiehall.org or
call % 212-247-7800. Besides practice, practice, practice, another way to
get to Carnegie Hall is by taking the N, Q, R, and W trains to 57th Street.
Brooklyn Academy of Music
The city’s most renowned contemporary arts institution, Brooklyn
Academy of Music (BAM) is often at the forefront of cutting-edge thea-
ter, opera, dance, and music.
Like Lincoln Center, BAM sponsors many special series, including the
prestigious Next Wave Festival in the fall, a showcase for experimental
American and international artists; and DanceAfrica in spring, a choice
of productions with an African heritage, ranging from traditional to
modern. BAM also sponsors three youth series during the year and free
outdoor concerts throughout the city in the summer.
BAM (% 718-636-4100; www.bam.org) is at 30 Lafayette Ave. between
Ashland Place and Felix Street; the BAM Harvey Theater is nearby at 
Chapter 14: Applauding the Cultural Scene 261

651 Fulton St. between Ashland and Rockwell places. If you want to take
public transportation, take the 2, 4, 5, or Q train to Atlantic Avenue or
the M, N, R, or W to Pacific Street. If you reserve tickets 24 hours in
advance and pay $5, you can take the BAM bus from the Whitney
Museum at Philip Morris, 120 Park Ave. at 42nd Street, which leaves one
hour before scheduled performance time. The return bus makes several
stops in Manhattan.
Other major concert spaces
Live music is always in the air in New York City; you just have to listen
for it. Here are some other exceptional venues where you can hear and
see a wide variety of the performing arts:
 Radio City Music Hall, 1260 Sixth Ave. at 50th Street (% 212-247-
4777; www.radiocity.com), is a gorgeous venue to see a roster of
renowned artists from crooner Tony Bennett to crossover salsa
star Marc Anthony to retro ’80s act Culture Club. (See the “Midtown
Attractions” map on p. 178.)
 Madison Square Garden, Seventh Avenue at 32nd Street (% 212-
465-6741; www.thegarden.com), proves that only the biggest stage
is appropriate for the biggest names — The Who, Madonna, and
Bruuuuuuuce (Springsteen, that is). Bring your binoculars — that
speck on the stage really is a grizzled Keith Richard. Adjacent to
the Garden is The Theater at Madison Square Garden, a smaller
space that usually features popular but not cover-of-People-
magazine famous musical acts. (See the “Midtown Attractions”
map on p. 178.)
 Town Hall, 123 W. 43rd St. between Sixth and Seventh avenues 
(% 212-840-2824; www.the-townhall-nyc.org), is a lovely,
medium-sized theater that hosts a wide range of events — every-
thing from world music to modern dance to one-man shows to 
live ensemble performances of Garrison Keillor’s Prairie Home
Companion radio program.
 Harlem’s legendary Apollo Theater, 253 W. 125th St. between Adam
Clayton Powell and Frederick Douglass boulevards (% 212-531-
5300; www.apollotheater.com), was the ultimate stage for musical
legends like Smokey Robinson and The Miracles, the Temptations,
and James Brown. These days, a steady stream of hip-hop and R&B
acts perform at this beautifully restored theater; Wednesday night is
the famous (and infamously unforgiving) Amateur Night. (See the
“Harlem & Upper Manhattan” map on p. 187.)
 An Upper West Side institution, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway
at 95th Street (% 212-864-1414; www.symphonyspace.org), offers
an eclectic mix of performing arts. The variety of shows at the
Peter Jay Sharp Theater includes series by the World Music
Institute as well as classical, rock, blues, and dance. Adjacent to 
the Peter Jay Sharp Theater is the Leonard Nimoy Thalia Theater;
Part V: Living It Up After Dark: New York City Nightlife 
262

the film revival house that was known for its quirky sightlines was
rescued by none other than Mr. Spock and has now been totally
renovated.
Classical Music
The New York Philharmonic at Avery Fisher Hall in Lincoln Center, at
Broadway and 64th Street (% 212-875-5656; www.nyphilharmonic.org),
offers what many consider to be the city’s best concerts. Ticket prices
range from less than $28 to $94.
Carnegie Hall, at 57th Street and Seventh Avenue (% 212-247-7800; www.
carnegiehall.org), is a gem in the crown of New York’s music commu-
nity. The price of a ticket depends on the performance; call or check the
Web site for information. (See the “Midtown Attractions” map on p. 178.)
The Brooklyn Academy of Music hosts performances of outstanding
quality, some of them experimental or cutting edge. Don’t let the location
of this famed venue dissuade you from going to one of its shows — it’s
quite easy to reach. See the section “Brooklyn Academy of Music,” earlier
in this chapter for specifics.
Chapter 14: Applauding the Cultural Scene 263
Dining after the show
It’s a well-known fact that classical music and opera can make you quite hungry. The
good news is that you are in New York and many restaurants are still open and serv-
ing full dinners past 10 or 11 p.m.
If you’re in the Theater District and you don’t mind being weighted down before bed-
time, finish off an enormous (and exceptional) pastrami sandwich and a slice of
cheesecake at the Carnegie Deli, 854 Seventh Ave., at 55th Street, (% 800-334-5606).
For most after-hours dining, you may want to head downtown. Two of the most popu-
lar spots are in the Meatpacking District in the West Village, and they’re open into the
wee hours. The funky Francophile diner Florent, 69 Gansevoort St., between
Greenwich and Washington streets (% 212-989-5779), and the authentic bistro Pastis,
9 Ninth Ave., at Little W. 12th Street (% 212-929-4844), are excellent choices. Then
there’s the raucous bistro Balthazar, 80 Spring St., at Crosby Street in SoHo (% 212-
965-1785).
In the East Village, head to Veselka, 144 Second Ave., at 9th Street (% 212-228-9862),
a comfortable and appealing diner offering Eastern European fare at rock-bottom
prices, and Katz’s Delicatessen, 205 E. Houston St., at Ludlow Street (% 212-254-2246)
for first-class Jewish deli eats served Friday and Saturday until 2:30 a.m. In Chinatown,
many restaurants are open late or even all night. Of note is the great New York
Noodletown, 281⁄2 Bowery, at Bayard Street (% 212-258-9800), which is open until 
3:30 a.m. nightly.

Bargemusic, in Brooklyn at Fulton Ferry Landing just south of the
Brooklyn Bridge, (% 718-624-2083 or 718-624-4061; www.bargemusic.
org) is an internationally renowned recital room located, yes, on an
actual barge. This unusual venue boasts more than 100 first-rate cham-
ber music performances a year. Three shows take place per week, on
Thursday and Friday evenings at 7:30 p.m. and Sunday afternoon at 
4 p.m. The musicians perform on a small stage in a cherry-paneled, 
fireplace-lit room accommodating 130 people. The music rivals what 
you can find in almost any other New York concert hall — and the
panoramic view of Manhattan through the glass wall behind the stage
can’t be beat. Tickets are just $35 ($25 for students), or $40 for perform-
ances by larger ensembles. But reserve your tickets well in advance. To
get to Bargemusic, take the 2 or 3 train to Clark Street or the A or C to
High Street.
Opera
The Metropolitan Opera Company, housed at the Metropolitan Opera
House at Lincoln Center, Broadway and 64th Street (% 212-362-6000;
www.metopera.org), stages classic operas and is the world’s premier
opera company today. The sets are works of art, and the performers
among the most famous in the world. Ticket prices range from $25 to
$295.
The New York City Opera, in the New York State Theater at Lincoln
Center, Broadway and 64th Street (% 212-870-5570; www.nycopera.
com), stages less elaborate shows (but from the same classic repertoire)
than the Metropolitan Opera Company, with lower ticket prices — seats
range in price from $32 to $115.
Performances of the Amato Opera Company, 319 Bowery at 2nd Street
(% 212-228-8200; www.amato.org), are likely to sell out quickly; the
theater has only 100 seats, with an average ticket price of $20. Buy your
tickets at least three weeks in advance to catch one of its performances
of classic Italian and other opera.
Music Alfresco
With summer also comes the sound of music to Central Park, where the
New York Philharmonic and the Metropolitan Opera regularly enter-
tain beneath the stars; for the current schedule, call % 212-360-3444,
212-875-5709, or 212-362-6000, or visit www.lincolncenter.org.
The most active music stage in Central Park, however, is SummerStage,
at Rumsey Playfield, midpark around 72nd Street. SummerStage has fea-
tured everyone from James Brown to Patti Smith; recent offerings have
included concerts by Hugh Masekela, the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion,
and Marianne Faithfull; “Viva, Verdi!” festival performances by the New
Part V: Living It Up After Dark: New York City Nightlife 
264

York Grand Opera; cabaret nights; and more. The season usually lasts
from mid-June to August. While some big-name shows charge admission,
tickets aren’t usually required but donations are always accepted. Call
the hot line at % 212-360-2777 or visit www.summerstage.org.
Additionally, most of the city’s top museums offer free music and other
programs after regular hours on select nights. The Metropolitan Museum
of Art has an extensive slate of offerings each week, including live classi-
cal music and cocktails on Friday and Saturday evenings. You can have
lots of fun at other museums as well, including the Guggenheim, whose
weekend Worldbeat Jazz series is a big hit; the American Museum of
Natural History, which features live jazz in the Hall of the Universe in the
new Rose Center for Earth and Space; and the Brooklyn Museum of Art,
which hosts the remarkably eclectic First Saturday program monthly.
Dance
The New York City Ballet (% 212-870-5570; www.nycballet.com) per-
forms at the New York State Theater, sharing this space with the New
York City Opera. The leading dance company in the world, it presents
wonderfully staged productions featuring world-class dancers. New
works of choreography use both classical and modern music. Their per-
formance of The Nutcracker is a highlight of the Christmas season.
The American Ballet Theater (% 212-477-3030; www.abt.org) per-
forms at the Metropolitan Opera House and shares its space with the
Metropolitan Opera. The guest companies and dancers are of interna-
tional renown in the world of dance.
City Center, 131 W. 55th St. between Sixth and Seventh avenues (% 877-
247-0430; www.citycenter.org), hosts premier companies, such as the
Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, Twyla Tharp Company, and Martha
Graham Company. Some of the world’s leading choreographers have per-
formed there. To get there, take the B, D, or E train to Seventh Avenue.
The Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Ave. at 19th Street (% 212-242-0800;
www.joyce.org), boasts performances by the likes of the Erick Hawkins
Dance Company and Meredith Monk. To get there, take the C or E train
to 23rd Street or the 1 to 18th Street.
Radio City Music Hall (see “Other major concert spaces” earlier in this
chapter for contact details) is home to a longstanding tradition in New
York that’s popular with children of all ages and needs no introduction:
the Rockettes. Their renowned “Christmas Spectacular” show is a one of
a kind treat. You can even take a Stage Door Tour guided by one of the
famed leggy beauties!

Hitting the Clubs and Bars
In This Chapter
 Listening to the music
 Yukking it up at the comedy clubs
 Satisfying your thirst at the hottest bars
 Negotiating the velvet rope at dance clubs
T
he so-called serious cultural entertainment is covered in Chapter 14,
so in this chapter, I dig into the less serious, but just as entertaining,
entertainment options in New York City. Whether it’s live jazz, rock,
comedy, or cabaret; or if it’s sweating on a dance floor, sipping a 
martini while lounging on a plush couch, or just people-watching in a
neighborhood pub, New York has plenty of choices for your evening’s
entertainment.
To find out what’s happening and where, check out these print and
online sources. The Village Voice, www.villagevoice.com, is a weekly
free newspaper that has a very good calendar with listings of weekly
entertainment. Rivaling the Voice in its listings is the weekly magazine,
Time Out New York, www.timeoutny.com. A good source for informa-
tion about bars and clubs is the annual book, Shecky’s New York Bar,
Club, & Lounge Guide. The Web site at www.sheckys.com is more cur-
rent than the book, as is Shecky’s Bar Phone at % 212-777-BARS or
212-777-2277, which offers up-to-the minute nightlife news. Another good
online bar source is www.murphguide.com. This website has all the
latest happy hour information and is a particularly good source if you
are seeking out an Irish pub, of which there are many in New York.
It’s About the Music
From garage bands at holes-in-the-wall with no cover charge to the world’s
greatest musicians in the glitzy stage of Jazz at Lincoln Center, you can
find something for every taste every night of the week in New York.
All that jazz
People come from all over the world to experience jazz in New York at
any of the city’s many celebrated clubs. No matter when you come,

you’re guaranteed to find top talent playing at a city venue. The best of
New York’s jazz clubs include:
 Birdland, 315 West 44th St., between Eighth and Ninth avenues 
(% 212-581-3080; www.birdlandjazz.com). This legendary club 
is one of the city’s premier jazz spots. The big room is spacious,
comfy, and classy, with an excellent sound system and top-notch
talent roster any night of the week. Expect lots of accomplished big
bands and jazz trios, but you can’t go wrong with the regular
Sunday night show, starring Chico O’Farrell’s smokin’ Afro-Cuban
Jazz Big Band. (See the “Midtown Arts & Nightlife” map.)
 Blue Note, 131 W. 3rd St., at Sixth Avenue (% 212-475-8592; www.
bluenote.net). This Greenwich Village institution attracts some 
of jazz’s biggest names. Lately the club has veered away from the
harder edge in favor of the popular smooth jazz. Prices can be
astronomical here. (See the “Downtown Arts & Nightlife” map.)
 Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Time Warner Center, 60th Street and
Broadway (% 212-258-9595; www.jalc.org). This beautiful, cozy
new jazz club is part of the Jazz at Lincoln Center complex in the
Time Warner Center on Columbus Circle. The club attracts an inter-
esting mix of both up-and-coming and established bands. My only
complaint is the high $30 cover every day of the week. (See the
“Uptown Arts & Nightlife” map.)
 Lenox Lounge, 288 Malcolm X Blvd., Lenox Avenue between 124th
and 125th streets (% 212-427-0253). The club’s history includes
past performances by such artists as Billie Holliday and Dinah
Washington. Now, at this beautifully restored club, you just may
hear the next Billie or Dinah. (See the “Harlem & Upper Manhattan”
map on p. 187.)
 Smoke, 2751 Broadway, between 105th and 106th streets (% 212-
864-6662; www.smokejazz.com). This intimate Upper West Side
club is a welcome throwback to the informal clubs of the past. On
weekends, covers never exceed $25, and the music is free Sunday
through Thursday. (See the “Uptown Arts & Nightlife” map.)
 St. Nick’s Pub, 773 St. Nicholas Ave., at 149th Street. (% 212-283-
9728; www.stnickspub.com). As unpretentious a club as you’ll
find, St. Nick’s in Harlem’s Sugar Hill district is the real deal, with
live entertainment every night and never a cover. This is where
Miles and Coltrane used to hang out after their own gigs. The tradi-
tion continues with Monday night jam sessions, African music on
Saturday nights, and open mic on Sundays.
 The Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Ave. South (% 212-255-4037;
www.villagevanguard.net). The Vanguard, established in 1935, is
a New York legend. All the greats, from Miles to Monk, have played
here, and their spirits live on in the new, high-quality talent of fre-
quent performers like Roy Hargrove and Bill Charlap. (See the
“Downtown Arts & Nightlife” map.)
Chapter 15: Hitting the Clubs and Bars 267

It’s only rock and roll
Rock and roll abounds in New York; here are just a few of the countless
offerings:
 Arlene Grocery, 95 Stanton St., between Ludlow and Orchard
streets (% 212-995-1652; www.arlenegrocery.net). This funky
little Lower East Side club has become a big name in the intimate
rock club scene. With covers that rarely peak beyond $7, it’s a bar-
gain as well. (See the “Downtown Arts & Nightlife” map.)
 Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey St., at Bowery (% 212-533-2111;
www.boweryballroom.com). There’s plenty of room in this club,
but it still has the feel of a more intimate venue. With great sight-
lines and sound quality, the Bowery Ballroom attracts excellent 
alt-rock talent. (See the “Downtown Arts & Nightlife” map.)
 Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street (% 212-777-1224; www.
irvingplaza.com). Perhaps the biggest name in New York’s rock
club scene, this mid-sized music hall is a prime stop for national-
name rock bands. The best seats can be found in the upstairs bal-
cony but come early for a spot. (See the “Midtown Arts & Nightlife”
map.)
 Mercury Lounge, 217 E. Houston St., at Essex Street and Avenue A
(% 212-260-4700; www.mercuryloungenyc.com). Another excel-
lent intimate spot for good quality, hard-edged rock and roll, and it
doesn’t cost a fortune. As a result, the Merc is always packed. (See
the “Downtown Arts & Nightlife” map.)
The best of the rest
What follows are clubs that are tough to classify; on one night they may
feature jazz or blues, and on another night you could hear cutting-edge
rock or world music:
 B.B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 W. 42nd St., between Seventh and
Eighth avenues (% 212-997-4144; www.bbkingblues.com). Despite
its name, B.B. King’s rarely sticks to the blues. Here you can find
big-name talent from pop, funk, soul, and rock more from the past
than from the present. On Sunday, a gospel lunch is served. (See
the “Midtown Arts & Nightlife” map.)
 The Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard St., between Broadway and
Church Street (% 212-219-3055; www.knittingfactory.com). At
New York’s premier avant-garde music venue, in the four separate
spaces within the Knitting Factory, you may hear performances
ranging from experimental jazz to acoustic folk to spoken-work to
poetry readings. (See the “Downtown Arts & Nightlife” map.)
 S.O.B.’s 204 Varick St., at Houston St. (% 212-243-9490; www.sobs.
com) If you like your music hot, hot, hot, visit S.O.B.’s, the city’s top
world-music venue, specializing in Brazilian, Caribbean, and Latin
Part V: Living It Up After Dark: New York City Nightlife 
268

sounds. The packed house dances and sings along nightly to
calypso, samba, mambo, African drums, reggae, or other global
grooves. This place is so popular that it’s an excellent idea to book
in advance, especially if you’d like table seating. Monday is dedi-
cated to Latin sounds, Tuesday to reggae; Friday features a late-
night French Caribbean dance party, while Saturday is reserved for
samba. (See the “Downtown Arts & Nightlife” map.)
 Tonic, 107 Norfolk St., between Rivington and Delancey streets 
(% 212-358-7501; www.tonicnyc.com). Tonic, which features
alternative jazz and rock, may not be for everyone, but if you like
your music challenging and in an intimate setting, this Tonic is for
you. (See the “Downtown Arts & Nightlife” map.)
Life is a cabaret
Want the quintessential New York night-on-the-town experience? Take 
in a cabaret. But be prepared to part with your greenbacks; covers can
range from $10 to $60 along with a two-drink or dinner check minimum.
Always reserve ahead. New York’s top cabarets include:
 Cafe Carlyle, at the Carlyle Hotel, 781 Madison Ave., at 76th Street
(% 212-744-1600). The great Bobby Short, who passed away in
2005, held court here for over 35 years. Without him, there will be a
temporary void, but the club still attracts rarefied talents like Betty
Buckley and Barbara Cook. The room is intimate and as swanky as
they come. Expect a high tab — admission is $65 to $75 with a $30
per-person minimum; with dinner, two people could easily spend
$300. But if you’re looking for the best of the best, look no further.
(See the “Uptown Arts & Nightlife” map.)
 Feinstein’s at the Regency, at the Regency Hotel, 540 Park Ave., 
at 61st Street (% 212-339-4095; www.feinsteinsattheregency.
com). If you don’t catch song impresario Michael Feinstein playing
here at the club he opened, don’t despair — high-wattage talent is
always on tap. (See the “Uptown Arts & Nightlife” map.)
 Joe’s Pub, At the Joseph Papp Public Theater, 425 Lafayette St.,
between Astor Place and Fourth Street. (% 212-539-8777; www.
joespub.com). This isn’t exactly your daddy’s cabaret. Still, this
beautiful — and hugely popular — cabaret and supper club, named
for the legendary Joseph Papp, is everything a New York cabaret
should be. The multilevel space serves up an American menu and
top-notch entertainment from a more eclectic mix of talent than
you’ll find on any other cabaret calendar. (See the “Downtown Arts
& Nightlife” map).
 The Oak Room, at the Algonquin Hotel, 59 W. 44th St., between
Fifth and Sixth avenues (% 212-840-6800). The Oak Room is one 
of the city’s most elegant and sophisticated spots for cabaret and
that’s saying a lot. You can almost always be sure that top-rated
talent is headlining here. (See the “Midtown Arts & Nightlife” map.)
Chapter 15: Hitting the Clubs and Bars 269

New York Comedy Is No Joke
Something about New York makes it a ripe breeding ground for comedi-
ans. The names of those who got their start here, from Dangerfield to
Seinfeld, are like a who’s who of comedy. And you never know, the neb-
bishy guy or girl up at the mike just may be the next Richard Pryor or
Ellen DeGeneres. New York’s top comedy clubs include:
 Carolines on Broadway, 1626 Broadway, between 49th and 50th
streets (% 212-757-4100; www.carolines.com). New York’s biggest
and highest-profile comedy club attracts the hottest headliners. (See
the “Midtown Arts & Nightlife” map.)
 Comedy Cellar, 117 Macdougal St., between Bleecker and W. Third
streets (% 212-254-3480; www.comedycellar.com). This intimate,
subterranean comedy club is a throwback to the days of the raw,
hard-edged stand-up comedy that spawned Lenny Bruce and
Richard Pryor. (See the “Downtown Arts & Nightlife” map.)
 Dangerfield’s, 1118 First Ave., between 61st and 62nd streets 
(% 212-593-1650; www.dangerfieldscomedyclub.com). If Tony
Soprano were a comedy fan, this would be his kind of place. Slick,
mature, and Vegas-like, Dangerfield’s gets plenty of respect. (See
the “Uptown Arts & Nightlife” map.)
 Gotham Comedy Club, 34 W. 22nd St., between Fifth and Sixth
avenues (% 212-367-9000; www.gothamcomedyclub.com). This is
New York’s trendiest comedy club of the moment. Look for theme
nights like “Comedy Salsa” and “A Very Jewish Christmas.” Tuesday
nights feature new talent. (See the “Midtown Arts & Nightlife” map.)
Hanging Out in New York’s Best Bars
You won’t have to search far to find a place to sit and have a cocktail in
New York. There are bars on every block, sometimes two or three to a
block. And they come in just about every variety from sleek and hip to
dark and gritty. Check out this small sampling of some of my favorite
New York bars.
For creative cocktails
 Bemelmans Bar, in the Carlyle Hotel, 35 E. 76th St., at Madison
Avenue (% 212-744-1600). The bar is a beauty with its whimsical
murals painted by children’s book illustrator, Ludwig Bemelmans,
who created the Madeline books. And they make beautiful (and
pricey) cocktails to match the creative setting. (See the “Uptown
Arts & Nightlife” map.)

270

 The Den, 2150 Fifth Ave., between 131st and 132nd streets. (% 212-
234-3015; www.thedenharlem.com). For not only the most creative
cocktails north of 96th Street, but also the most imaginative drink
names in all of Manhattan, come uptown to the fun, funky Den. Here
you can sip concoctions like the “pimp slap,” “sex in the inner city,”
“Bahama baby mama drama,” and the “Harlem ice tea,” while watch-
ing a blaxploitation flick off the bar/restaurant’s brick wall. Don’t ask
me what’s in the drinks; just know that they are colorful, sweet, and
very potent. (See the “Harlem & Upper Manhattan” map.)
 Double Happiness, 173 Mott St., between Grand and Broome
streets (% 212-941-1282). The only indicator to the subterranean
entrance of this Chinatown hideaway is a vertical watch your step
sign. Once through the door, you find a beautifully designed
speakeasy-ish lounge. You’re going to be doubly happy if you try
the green tea martini, an inspired house creation. (See the
“Downtown Arts & Nightlife” map.)
 King Cole Bar, in the St. Regis Hotel, 2 E. 55th St., at Fifth Avenue
(% 212-744-4300). The supposed birthplace of the Bloody Mary,
they continue to make a very mean and tasty one here. If you aren’t
interested in a Bloody Mary, order something else. You really can’t
go wrong. Don’t forget to admire the very famous Maxfield Parish
mural above the bar. (See the “Midtown Arts & Nightlife” map.)
 Pegu Club, 77 W. Houston St., between Wooster Street and West
Broadway. (% 212-473-7348; www.peguclub.com). Mixologist and
owner, Audrey Saunders, formerly of Bemelman’s Bar in the Carlyle
Hotel, makes magic with cocktails. She’s since moved on to open
Pegu Club, her own little downtown gathering spot where she can
even better showcase her immense talents. The cocktails, perfectly
poured, stirred, and shaken, change seasonally and will astound you
with their creativity. (See the “Downtown Arts & Nightlife” map.)
 Pravda, 281 Lafayette St., between Houston and Prince streets 
(% 212-334-5015). You can find more than 70 vodkas here from 
18 countries. They also offer eight specialty martinis. (See the
“Downtown Arts & Nightlife” map.)
In 2003, smoking was made illegal in all restaurants and bars in New York
City (except for a few cigar bars). So if you get the urge, join the huddled
(and shivering, in the winter) masses outside the bar, in what some not-
so-fondly call the “Bloomberg Lounge” (after Mayor Mike, who pushed
through the anti-smoking laws).
For old-world charm
 The Old Town Bar & Grill, 45 E. 18th St., between Broadway and
Park Avenue (% 212-529-6732). The bar where food is shuttled to
customers via a dumb waiter from the basement kitchen has been
featured on film and TV (the opening credits of Letterman in his
NBC days). (See the “Midtown Arts & Nightlife” map.)
Chapter 15: Hitting the Clubs and Bars 271

 Pete’s Tavern, 129 E. 18th St., at Irving Place (% 212-473-7676).
This place is so old it is said to have opened when Lincoln was still
president. (See the “Midtown Arts & Nightlife” map.)
 White Horse Tavern, 567 Hudson St., at 11th Street (% 212-243-
9260). This circa 1880 pub is where Dylan Thomas supposedly 
had his very last drink before becoming a bar legend. (See the
“Downtown Arts & Nightlife” map.)
 Ear Inn, 326 Spring St., between Greenwich and Washington streets
(% 212-226-9060). This cluttered old, 1870-established pub is a
cranky relief in super-chic SoHo. (See the “Downtown Arts &
Nightlife” map.)
 Dublin House, 225 W. 79th St., between Broadway and Amsterdam
Avenue (% 212-874-9528). For years, like a welcoming beacon, the
Dublin House’s neon harp has blinked invitingly. This very old pub
is a no-frills Irish saloon and the perfect spot for a drink after visit-
ing the nearby Museum of Natural History or Central Park. The
Guinness is cheap and drawn perfectly by the very able and some-
times crusty bartenders. (See the “Uptown Arts & Nightlife” map.)
For dive-bar aficionados
 Jimmy’s Corner, 140 W. 44th St., between Broadway and Sixth
Avenue (% 212-221-9510). Jimmy’s is a tough guy’s joint that has
happily survived the Disneyfication of Times Square. Beer is cheap
and drinks aren’t fancy, so skip the theme bars and restaurants in
the area and go for an after-theater pop at Jimmy’s instead. (See the
“Midtown Arts & Nightlife” map.)
 Subway Inn, 143 E. 60th St., at Lexington Avenue (% 212-223-9829).
This is my all-time favorite dive and has been around for more than
60 years. No matter what time of day, it’s always dark as midnight
inside the Subway Inn. (See the “Midtown Arts & Nightlife” map.)
For drinks with a view
 Rise Bar, at the Ritz-Carlton New York, Battery Park, 2 West St. 
(% 212-344-0800). On the hotel’s 14th floor, the bar boasts incom-
parable views of Lady Liberty and busy New York Harbor. (See the
“Downtown Arts & Nightlife” map.)
 Pen-Top Bar, at the Peninsula Hotel, 700 Fifth Ave., at 55th Street
(% 212-956-2888). The views of midtown Manhattan are awesome
here and make the steep price of the drinks easier to take. (See the
“Midtown Arts & Nightlife” map.)
 79th Street Boat Basin Cafe, 79th St., at the Hudson River (% 212-
496-5542). As you sip your cocktail, enjoy a beautiful sunset and
watch boats bob on the river; you may just forget you’re in New
York for a moment. Open from May through September. (See the
“Uptown Arts & Nightlife” map.)
Part V: Living It Up After Dark: New York City Nightlife 
272

For gay & lesbian nightlife
 Barracuda, 275 W. 22nd St., between Seventh and Eighth avenues
(% 212-645-8613). Located in the heart of gay Chelsea, this bar is
regularly voted best gay bar in New York by the various local GLBT
publications. (See the “Midtown Arts & Nightlife” map.)
 Boiler Room, 86 E. Fourth St., between First and Second avenues
(% 212-254-7536). This is New York’s favorite gay dive bar and a
fun East Village hangout. (See the “Downtown Arts & Nightlife”
map.)
 Duplex Cabaret, 61 Christopher St., at Seventh Avenue (% 212-
255-5438; www.theduplex.com). High camp is the norm at this gay
cabaret and piano-bar, still going after 50 years. It once hosted the
likes of Woody Allen and Joan Rivers in their early stand-up careers.
(See the “Downtown Arts & Nightlife” map.)
 Henrietta Hudson, 444 Hudson St., at Morton Street (% 212-924-
3347; www.henriettahudsons.com). This popular lesbian hangout
has a great jukebox and a deejay on weekends. (Expect a $5–$7
cover charge.) (See the “Downtown Arts & Nightlife” map.)
Some of the hottest “clubs” are actually traveling parties that alight in var-
ious spots depending on the day, making them hard for visitors to find.
Various publications — Time Out New York’s Gay & Lesbian section, as
well as the GLBT-specific Homo Xtra, GONYC magazine, and others I list in
Chapter 6 — provide the best up-to-the-minute club information. Another
good source is the Web; try the gay NYC site at www.gaycenter.org.
Hitting the Dance Clubs and Getting 
Across the Velvet Rope
Dance club fame is transient; one year a club can be white hot, but the
next year it’s not even hip enough for the Bridge and Tunnel crowd.
These dance clubs, as of this writing, are closer to the hot, hot, hot vari-
ety. Keep in mind that many clubs have dress codes. Just to be safe,
leave your sneakers, shorts, flip-flops, and t-shirts at the hotel. Well-
dressed folks will always slide past the velvet ropes first.
 Avalon, 660 Sixth Ave., at 20th Street (% 212-807-7780; www.ny
avalon.com). The old dance club, the Limelight, once reigned
supreme at this location during the decadent ’80s; now Avalon has
moved into this large, former church with its many “private” rooms.
(See the “Midtown Arts & Nightlife” map.)
 Cain, 544 W. 27th Street, between Tenth and Eleventh avenues 
(% 212-947-8000). The theme is Africa — South Africa to be spe-
cific. The front door has elephant trunk handles and zebra hides
are everywhere. The big game is celebrity spotting.

 Cielo, 18 Little W. 12th St., between Ninth Avenue and Washington
Street (% 212-645-5700; www.cieloclub.com). At Cielo, you’ll find
the best sound system of any small club in New York. House is big
here and they regularly bring in some of the best DJs from around
the globe. The renowned Louis Vega spins on Wednesdays. An
authentic, glittering disco ball rotates above a sunken dance floor. 
 Crobar, 530 W. 28th St., between Tenth and Eleventh avenues 
(% 212-629-9000; www.crobar.com). This 25,000-square-foot club
can fit up to 3,000 people, so the odds of you getting in are very
good. Once inside, top-name deejays have you sweating in no time.
(See the “Midtown Arts & Nightlife” map.)
 Spirit, 530 W. 27th St., between Tenth and Eleventh avenues 
(% 212-268-9477; www.spiritnewyork.com). This New Age dance
emporium features a healing center and organic vegetarian restau-
rant, along with a 10,000-square-foot dance floor. (See the “Midtown
Arts & Nightlife” map.)
 Swing 46, 349 W. 46th St., between Eighth and Ninth avenues 
(% 212-262-9554; www.swing46.com). As its name suggests, the
music here, mostly live, is swing. And if swing dancing is new to
you, free lessons are offered Wednesday through Saturday. (See 
the “Midtown Arts & Nightlife” map.)
New York nightlife starts late and finishes really late. Things don’t get
going until at least 11 p.m. Most places don’t take credit cards, so bring
cash (or be prepared to fork over a high transaction charge at an in-
house ATM). Cover charges can range from $7 to $30 and often increase
as the night goes on. The best source for club information is the weekly
Time Out New York magazine. It lists cover charges for the week’s big
events and gives sound advice on the type of music and the type of
crowd each event attracts. (Refer to this chapter’s introduction for addi-
tional sources of entertainment information.)
If you’re somewhat masochistic, enjoy humiliation and ridicule, and are
determined to get into that oh-so-trendy club you heard about back home,
keep these pointers in mind to help you get beyond the velvet rope:
 Be polite.
 Dress fashionably.
 Don’t try to talk your way in.
 Arrive early (think 9 p.m.), and then be willing to hang out at a
mostly empty club until the action heats up.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . . 
I
warn you about some New York experiences you should
avoid and some that you should deﬁnitely seek out, and I
give you the lowdown on the top ten eating experiences in
the city.

Chapter 16
The Top Ten Offbeat 
New York City Experiences
In This Chapter
 Riding the subway from New York to Korea
 Walking the radical way
 Heading to the beach, Coney Island style
 Biking the Hudson
M
ost of this book covers the basics about New York, the top attrac-
tions, neighborhoods, restaurants, and hotels. But New York has
many layers, and you can find riches within each one of them. Check out
some of my favorite New York experiences that offer a variety of ways to
see the city.
Ride the International Express
The number 7 train is sometimes referred to as the International Express.
Take it out of Manhattan and through the borough of Queens, and you
pass through one ethnic neighborhood after another, from Indian to Thai,
from Peruvian to Columbian, from Chinese to Korean. Get off at any stop
along the way, sample the local cuisine, and keep repeating to yourself,
“I’m still in the United States, I’m still in the United States.” Built by immi-
grants in the early 1900’s, the number 7 IRT (Interborough Rapid Transit)
brought those same immigrants to homes on the outer fringes of New
York City. That tradition has continued as immigrants from around the
world have settled close by the number 7’s elevated tracks. In 1999 the
Queens Council on the Arts nominated the International Express for des-
ignation of a National Millennium Trail and that nomination resulted in 
its selection as representative of the American immigrant experience by
the White House Millennium Council, the United States Department of
Transportation, and the Rails-to-Trails Conservancy. For more about the
International Express and for tours, visit the Queens Council on the Arts
website at www.queenscouncilarts.org, or call % 718-657-3377 for
more information.

Explore the Museum of Sex
Don’t be bashful. How many cities can claim their own Museum of Sex?
This one debuted in 2002 and despite its provocative title, offers a stud-
ied, historical look at the history of sex in our culture. In 2006, the exhibit,
“Peeping, Probing, & Porn: Four Centuries of Graphic Sex in Japan” was fea-
tured. Don’t miss a trip through the gift shop — definitely not your typical
museum shop. How about a $1,375 snakeskin souvenir to show your
friends back home? Note: Many of the displays are very graphic, so the
museum may not be for everyone. This museum is located at 233 Fifth
Ave., at 27th Street (% 866-MOSEX-NYC or 866-667-3969; www.museum
ofsex.com). By subway, take the N, R or 6 train to 28th Street.
You must be 18 or older to visit the Museum of Sex.
Stroll Riverside Park
Central Park may be the king of New York parks, but if I can’t have it, 
I’ll take Riverside Park any day. This underrated beauty, designed by
Frederick Law Olmstead (the same man who designed Central Park)
stretches four miles from 72nd Street to 158th Street. The serpentine
route along the Hudson River offers a variety of lovely river vistas, 14
playgrounds, two tennis courts, softball and soccer fields, a skate park,
beach volleyball, and the Boat Basin. Strolling folks with the munchies
can find two cafes: the 79th Street Boat Basin Cafe at 79th Street 
(% 212-496-5542) and O’Hurley’s Hudson Beach Cafe at 105th Street
(% 917-370-3448). This park also features monuments like the Eleanor
Roosevelt Monument at 72nd Street, the Soldiers and Sailors Monument
at 90th Street, and Grant’s Tomb (quick: Who’s buried there?) at 122nd
Street.
Ride the Roosevelt Island Tram
Impress your family and friends with a little-known, but spectacular, view
of the New York skyline by taking them for a ride on the Roosevelt Island
Tram (% 212-832-4543, ext. 1). This is the same tram that King Kong
“attacks” in the Universal Studios Theme Park in Florida. (It’s also the
same tram you have probably seen in countless movies, most recently
Spider-Man.) The Tram originates at 59th Street and Second Avenue, costs
$2 each way ($2 round-trip for seniors), and takes four minutes to traverse
the East River to Roosevelt Island, where a series of apartment complexes
and parks sit. During those four minutes, you’re treated to gorgeous views
down the East River and of the east side skyline with views of the United
Nations and four bridges: the Queensborough, Williamsburg, Manhattan,
and the Brooklyn Bridge. On a clear day you may even spot the Statue 
of Liberty. The Tram operates daily from 6 a.m. until 2:30 a.m. and until
3:30 a.m. on weekends.
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
284

Head to Coney Island
I can’t believe I’m calling Coney Island an offbeat experience. This is the
same Coney Island that thousands used to flock to on a summer’s day.
But Coney Island is just a shell of what it once was in its heyday (the
early part of the 20th century). That shell and the idea of what it once
was make it an intriguing attraction. The almost mythical old amuse-
ment ride, the Parachute Jump, which towers over the Boardwalk, is
recently refurbished though long inoperable; it stands as a monument 
to Coney Island. At the time of this writing, Coney Island is planning a 
$1 billion makeover, scheduled to begin in 2007.
But don’t assume that this is a dead amusement park; Astroland, home
of the famed Cyclone roller coaster, has some great rides for children
and adults. The best amusement of all, however, is the people-watching.
Coney Island attracts its fair share of odd, freaky, and funky visitors, and
it hosts a handful of events and attractions that many people find a bit
offbeat. Each 4th of July at noon, Nathan’s Famous Hot Dogs holds its
hot dog eating contest. And each year (usually on the Sat closest to the
first day of summer, at the end of June) the fabulous and gaudy Coney
Island Mermaid Parade (www.coneyisland.com/mermaid.shtml), the
nation’s largest art parade, is presided over by a celebrity “King Neptune”
and “Queen Mermaid.” On January 1st, members of the Polar Bear Swim
Club show their masochistic gusto by taking a plunge into the icy ocean.
The small Coney Island Museum, 1208 Surf Ave., near W. 12th Street 
(% 718-372-5158; www.coneyisland.com/museum.shtml) showcases
fun exhibits detailing the history of Coney Island. Open year-round is the
New York Aquarium at Surf Avenue and West 8th Street (% 718-265-
FISH; www.nyaquarium.com), a small but interesting branch of the
Wildlife Conservation Society that offers underwater exhibits, a touch
pool, and performing sea lions. The rides and amusement park are open
from Memorial Day until mid-September, which is also the best time to
visit Coney Island. Bring your bathing suit and test the waters. To reach
Coney Island by subway, take trains D, Q, or F to Coney Island-Stillwell
Avenue, Brooklyn.
Visit the House Where Satchmo Lived
Louis Armstrong was an international celebrity and could have lived
anywhere, yet he choose to live in an unassuming, bi-level house in the
working-class neighborhood of Corona, Queens. This was the great
Satchmo’s home from 1943 until his death in 1971. The Louis Armstrong
House Museum, (34–56 107th St., Corona, Queens; % 718-478-8274;
www.satchmo.net; Subway: 7 to 103rd St./Corona Plaza; walk north on
103rd Street, turn right on 37th Avenue, turn left onto 107th Street, and
the house is a half-block north of 37th Avenue) is now a National
Historic Landmark and a New York City landmark and a museum open 
to the public. A 40-minute guided tour takes you through the small,
Chapter 16: The Top Ten Offbeat New York City Experiences 285

impeccably preserved home and explains the significance of each room
to both Louis and Lucille. My favorite is Armstrong’s den, where he kept
his reel-to-reel tape recordings, cataloging everything he taped — music,
conversations, and compositions, some of which are displayed on his
desk. The house also includes a small exhibit with some of his memora-
bilia, including two of his trumpets, and a gift shop, where many of his
CDs are for sale along with other Satchmo-centric items. 
Tour Little Italy in the Bronx
Taking a trip to Little Italy in the Bronx is growing in popularity, thus
making it not so offbeat. Since the near-demise of Little Italy in Manhattan,
the area centered on Arthur Avenue, known as the Little Italy in the Bronx,
is the place to go for old-fashioned Italian charm, food, and ambiance. You
know you’ve arrived on Arthur Avenue when you smell the fresh-baked
bread, stacks of bacala (dried salt cod), aromatic sausages and cheeses,
and tomato sauce. Spend the day browsing the markets and having lunch
at one of the local restaurants or pizzerias followed by cappucino or
espresso at a cafe. Or even better, combine your visit with a trip to the
nearby Bronx Zoo. To get to Arthur Avenue, take the 4 or D train to
Fordham Road, 12 bus east, 2 or 5 train to Pelham Parkway, 12 bus west,
Metro North Harlem Line to Fordham Road, and shuttle bus to Belmont
and Bronx Zoo.
Bike Along the Hudson River
If walking is just not enough exercise for you, a good alternative is to
rent a bike and ride the length of Manhattan via the work-in-progress
Hudson River Park. As of this writing, you can bike from Battery Park to
Fort Tryon Park near the George Washington Bridge. Although detours
along the way occasionally may take you on and off bike paths, don’t let
them deter you from a remarkable bike ride. Along the route you pass
the World Trade Center site, the far West Village, Chelsea Piers, the USS
Intrepid, Riverside Park, and the George Washington Bridge.
Wander the Streets on Sunday Morning
This may not sound so offbeat, and I’ve noticed quite a few tourists, usu-
ally jet-lagged Europeans, wandering the parks and streets on early
Sunday mornings, but try it some time. The city has a special feel on
Sunday mornings. The streets are generally deserted, and things are so
quiet it’s almost eerie. Even though I’m far from alone, I feel as if I have
the city to myself early on Sunday mornings, and I find that very exhila-
rating. Is it worth getting an early wake-up call? That’s for you to decide.
Or it may be easier not to go to bed at all on Saturday night. . . .
Part VI: The Part of Tens

Spend Some Time with the Dead
Only in the Bronx would a cemetery be an essential place to visit. And
that ain’t no joke. Woodlawn Cemetery, (Webster Avenue and 233rd
Street; % 718-920-0500; www.thewoodlawncemetery.org; Subway: 4 to
Woodlawn Station) is no ordinary cemetery. It was created in 1863 and is
best known for its ornate and imaginative mausoleums and monuments.
The grounds stretch over 400 acres and house the country’s first commu-
nity mausoleum, which became operational during 1967. Woodlawn
Cemetery is one of the city’s most famous and you’ll find a number of
notables laid to rest here including salsa superstar Cecila Cruz, jazz
geniuses Miles Davis and Duke Ellington, former Mayor of New York City
Fiorello LaGuardia, Joseph Pulitzer, songwriter George M. Cohan, and 
theater impresario Oscar Hammerstein. Weekend guided tours are 
available.

Chapter 17
The Top Ten Essential 
New York City Eating
Experiences
In This Chapter
 Noshing on the Lower East Side
 Eating a slice standing up
 Having your chicken . . . and waffles, too
N
o matter what your budget, you’ll find it almost impossible to 
go hungry in New York. But do you want to eat what you can eat
any day of the week back home or do you want a true, uniquely New 
York eating experience? See below for ten essential New York eating 
experiences.
A Slice of Pizza
Toss some dried red pepper or granulated garlic on it and eat it standing
up, folded to capture the grease before it stains your clothes. That’s the
way we’ve been eating pizza in New York for years. The classic New York
slice, however, has been on the decline ever since an influx of chain
pizzerias like Dominos and Papa John’s have corrupted the pizza land-
scape. You can still find a good slice, but you need to do your research.
My favorites are Patsy’s of East Harlem (2207–91 First Ave.; % 212-534-
9783) where you can get old-fashioned coal-oven pizza by the slice, a
rarity; Joe’s Pizza (7 Carmine St.; % 212-366-1182) in the Village, open
until the wee hours, so particularly satisfying for your late night crav-
ings; and Sal & Carmine’s (2671 Broadway; % 212-663-7651) on the
Upper West Side. 

Bagel with Lox
If there is anything more simply satisfying than a fresh, out of the oven
bagel topped with schmear of cream cheese and a razor-thin slice of lox,
I don’t know what it is. This combination might be one of the most popu-
lar breakfast items in New York. And you can find it at just about every
diner and deli in the city. But for the best, head to the Upper West Side
and Barney Greengrass, the Sturgeon King (541 Amsterdam Ave.; 
% 212-724-4707) — they have been making this now world famous 
combination since 1908.
Cuban/Chinese
There used to be countless Cuban/Chinese restaurants in Manhattan,
most centered on the Upper West Side. The boom began in the late
1950s after the Cuban revolution and the beginning of the Castro regime.
Chinese-Cubans emigrated to New York and opened up restaurants serv-
ing both Cantonese-style Chinese food and traditional Cuban food. A few
are left and my favorite is Flor de Mayo (2651 Broadway; % 212-595-
2520). Here I can order a big bowl of hearty wonton soup followed by a
huge plate of yellow rice and black beans.
Chicken and Waffles
You are out late, it’s getting near dawn, and you can’t decide whether
you want dinner or breakfast. You can’t resist the fried chicken, but waf-
fles sound good, too. So you try a little of both together — maple syrup
melding with hot sauce; sweet with savory. And that is the purported
legend behind this funky combination. You might get an argument from
denizens of Chicago, Los Angeles, and Atlanta, where you can also find
chicken and waffles, but the birthplace of this unusual dish is said to be
Wells Chicken and Waffles in Harlem in 1938. Wells is long gone yet
chicken and waffles live on. A number of restaurants in Harlem continue
what Wells started. The most popular is Amy Ruth’s (113 W. 116th St.;
% 212-280-8779) where not only can you get chicken and waffles, but
grits and fish cakes, another outstandingly unique combination.
The Hot Dog
This might be just too obvious a choice, but I don’t think so. You can
find carts selling cheap hot dogs throughout the city. You might be
tempted to try one just to say you did. And I think you should; it is defi-
nitely a New York experience. But even better, take the train out to
Coney Island and sample a Nathan’s Famous dog right on the boardwalk
(1310 Surf Ave.; % 718-946-2202). Maybe it’s the salty sea air enveloping
you. Maybe it’s the crisp skin of the hot dog, or the way it’s perfectly
Chapter 17: The Top Ten Essential NYC Eating Experiences 289

fried. Whatever it is, your Nathan’s hot dog from Coney Island will defi-
nitely be memorable. If you can’t make it to Coney Island, my second
choice would be Gray’s Papaya, (2090 Broadway; % 212-799-0243). The
“recession special,” two hot dogs and a drink, is the special whether the
country is in a recession or not. 
Pasta Fagioli
Some call it “pasta fazool,” others “pasta fagioli.” Whatever, it’s pasta
with beans. And, no, this Southern Italian comfort dish is not unique to
New York, but having a delicious, hearty bowl at Café al Mercato in the
Arthur Avenue indoor market in the Little Italy of the Bronx (2344 Arthur
Ave.; % 718-364-7681) is most definitely special. You might want to
follow up your pasta fagioli with a wedge of the cafe’s homemade focac-
cia topped with broccoli rabe. And if you are lucky and have a refrigera-
tor in your hotel room, bring back a ball of fresh mozzarella and/or
slices of Italian salami or mortadella from Mike’s Deli, also in the Arthur
Avenue indoor market (% 718-295-5033). 
The New York Oyster
There was a time when New York was more the big oyster than the big
apple. The local harbor beds were overflowing with oysters and the mol-
lusk helped feed the city. But you don’t want to eat an oyster from New
York harbor these days for obvious reasons. Instead, head to the Grand
Central Oyster Bar in Grand Central Station (% 212-490-6653) where,
since 1913, oysters have been their specialty. Order oysters on the half
shell from Washington State, Maine, Virginia, or Canada and, with the
Metro North commuter trains rumbling in the station in the background
along with the cacophonous din of other diners and the magnificent
tiled ceiling of the restaurant above, try to imagine that you are sucking
down a New York oyster in the days when you could actually eat a New
York oyster. It’s not as big a reach as you might think.
The New York Strip
The restaurant scene in New York is extremely volatile, but one consis-
tent is the steakhouse. The steakhouse does not have to worry about
trends or gimmicks. Sure, there were some rocky moments when red
meat was considered a no-no by the diet police, but the steakhouse
weathered the storm and not only survived, but thrived. Some of New
York’s oldest restaurants are steakhouses, and for good reason. They
keep it simple. Some might have sawdust on the floor, others clay pipes
on the ceiling, or photos of celebrities on the walls, but that is about as
fancy as they get. What they do is serve quality, properly aged meat
cooked perfectly and presented in a no-nonsense, no-frills manner.
Places like Keen’s (72 W. 36th St.; % 212-949-3636), est. 1885; Peter
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
290

Luger in Williamsburg, Brooklyn (178 Broadway; % 718-387-7400), 
est. 1887; Gallagher’s (228 W. 52nd St., % 212-245-5336), est. 1922; and
Frankie & Johnnie’s (269 W. 45th St.; % 212-997-9494), est. 1926, have
their loyal fans and arguments abound on which is the best. Visit any of
the above and your New York steakhouse obligation will be more than
fulfilled.
The Old World
Go to the Lower East Side and you might see new, gleaming towers. You
might notice trendy bars and restaurants frequented by denizens of gen-
eration X, Y, and Z, but if you look a little harder you will see living rem-
nants of a storied gastronomical past. Start at the gateway, on the south
side of Houston Street at 137 Houston St., where you’ll find the Yonah
Schimmel Knish Bakery (% 212-477-2852). Since 1910, Schimmel’s has
been providing the city with that unique to New York doughy potato-
stuffed snack. A few strides east at 179 Houston, you’ll come upon Russ
& Daughter’s (% 212-475-4880), one of the city’s oldest (established in
1914) and finest purveyors of smoked fish. There will most likely be a
commotion at your next stop; you might see bus loads of tourists, but
don’t let that deter you from taking a ticket and getting on line for a
Kosher hot dog or a monstrous corned beef sandwich at Katz’s
Delicatessen (205 E. Houston St.; % 212-254-2246). From Houston head
down to 367 Grand St., just east of Essex Street, for a bialy from Kossar’s
Bialys (% 212-431-7668). They’re open 24-hours and guarantee your
bialy will always be fresh. Finally, end your Lower East Side food tour 
at Guss’s Pickles (85 Orchard St.; % 917-701-4000), for a sour green
tomato . . . or a pickle.
Ice Cream with a View
The Brooklyn Bridge is, no doubt, on your New York itinerary. Plan your
walk across this grand structure for later in the day, maybe close to
dusk. Once over the bridge on the Brooklyn side, head down to the river
until you get to what appears to be an old fireboat house right on the
waterfront. Inside that structure you will find the best ice cream in the
city at the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory (1 Water St.; % 718-246-3963).
The ice cream is all homemade and you won’t be challenged by too
many exotic choices. Keep it simple and just add some of their own
amazing hot fudge to whatever you get. By now the sun will be setting
and you can eat your ice cream with the visual treat of the twinkling
lights on the buildings of Lower Manhattan across the river. Not that it
needs the enhancement, but your ice cream will taste even better with
that view.

Ten New York City
Experiences to Avoid
In This Chapter
 Ringing in the New Year in Times Square (stay away!)
 Taking a chance on a card game (don’t!)
 Getting a deal on electronics (scam!)
 Experiencing a horse-drawn carriage ride (avoid it!)
N
ew York offers plenty of offbeat adventures that you may want to
experience (see Chapter 16 for a rundown). Here’s the flipside:
things, events, and places to avoid. Take note: Some of the experiences 
I list are often featured prominently in guidebooks as must-do experi-
ences. You may, in fact, have a lifelong dream of ringing in the New Year
in Times Square. But my cranky nature leads me to believe otherwise. I’ll
leave it to you to ultimately decide.
New Year’s Eve in Times Square
You see the event on television every year and now you’re here. This is
your chance to be one of the hundreds of thousands of revelers packed
tightly together in the frigid cold to watch the ball drop. Don’t do it! Find
a nice warm restaurant or bar to celebrate in. Or better yet, have room
service deliver a delicious meal and some bubbly for you and your loved
one, and don’t go out at all. Despite the happy faces that you see on tele-
vision, the whole thing is a miserable experience and not worth the
forced elation of blowing on a noisemaker at midnight with half a million
others. (You won’t find too many New Yorkers here . . . it’s very much an
out-of-towners’ event.)
Chain Restaurants
Oh yes, they’re here, probably to stay — and with probably more to
come. I’m referring to those restaurants with familiar names like Olive
Garden, Applebee’s, Red Lobster, and Domino’s. When you begin to feel

the pangs of hunger, ask yourself: Did I come to New York to eat exactly
what I can eat in every city or town in this country? Or did I come here
to experience what makes New York so unique? And that includes the
amazing variety of unchained restaurants, from the coffee shops and
diners where real New Yorkers eat to the bargain-priced ethnic cuisine
and higher-end dining experiences. Bypass the old standards and try
something homey, glamorous, or new. You won’t regret it.
Three-Card Monte
When you see a crowd gathered around a cardboard box with one man
flipping cards, madly enticing innocent rubes into his game while
another guy scans the crowd for undercover cops, keep on walking.
Don’t stop and listen to the dealer’s spiel or think you can be the one to
beat him at his game. Even if you’re quite sure which of the facedown
cards is the Red Queen, don’t put your money down. It won’t be the one
you pick. Oh, someone who works with the dealer will play and win to
make you think you’ve got a chance. But you don’t. Buy a lottery ticket
instead. People do win that.
Waiting on Lines for Breakfast
(And please note, New Yorkers wait on line, not in line). Sometimes New
Yorkers can be masochistic — and silly. They hear about a restaurant
that serves a great breakfast, and they begin lining up on weekend morn-
ings to eat. Sometimes they wait for over an hour, standing outside,
winter or summer, to order pancakes, omelets, or whatever else the
breakfast menu offers. They do this even though many coffee shops and
diners are serving patrons the same foods at much less cost and without
more than a minute’s wait. Now what would you do?
Brunch
One of the greatest scams in the food biz is the concept of “brunch.”
Whoever thought of this faux combo of breakfast and lunch was a
genius. He or she was aware of the marketing possibilities connected
with the concept: Serve a glorified breakfast starting at around 10 or 
11 a.m. (so if you’re up early and hungry you just have to wait), throw in
a watered-down drink or cheap champagne, and inflate the price. Make it
a social thing, something for people to “do.” Brunch, despite my misgiv-
ings, has been a resounding success. But it’s not for me. I’m of the “three
squares” school: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. On top of everything else,
restaurants that serve brunch usually make you wait on line for it. And
you know how I feel about lines.

The St. Patrick’s Day Parade
On March 17, packs of suburban teenagers (with cases of beer between
them) begin arriving early via the Long Island Rail Road, Metro North, or
New Jersey Transit. By the time the parade kicks off, they — along with a
few off-duty policemen — are sloshed. And even before the parade ends,
the fights begin and the vomit flows as freely as the beer did earlier. The
pubs are packed, and the already-high price of drinks gets even higher. If
you truly yearn for a bit of the Irish on this day, for your own good, stay
home and watch The Quiet Man or listen to the Irish Tenors sing
“Danny Boy.”
Electronics Stores
You may notice a wealth of “electronics stores” in and around Times
Square and Fifth Avenue or wherever gullible tourists frequent. Many of
the stores post banners advertising a GOING OUT OF BUSINESS sale. These
guys have been going out of business since the Stone Age. That’s the
bait and switch; pretty soon you’ve spent too much money for not
enough stereos or cameras or MP3 players. The people who work at
these stores are a special breed of snake; they work you hard to take
their “deal.” Don’t even get close enough to let them sink their fangs 
into you because after they do, you’re usually theirs for the taking.
Driving in the City
I warn you about driving in the city in Chapter 7, but it bears repeating.
So if you want a world of aggravation, rent a car, tolerate the traffic,
maneuver amongst the yellow cabs, and try to find a parking place. And
when you do, make sure the parking place is a legal one (read the fine
print on the street signs). Or put the car in a garage and watch your
vacation budget fritter away. (If you must drive your car to get here, con-
sider staying in a hotel that offers free or discounted parking.) With sub-
ways, buses, and your feet, New York has the best and fastest public
transportation. A car is a luxury you want no part of.
Horse-Drawn Carriage Rides
Pity those poor beasts of burden. They get dragged out in the heat
(though not extreme heat) and cold (though not extreme cold) with a
buggy attached to them just to give the passenger the feel of an old world,
romantic buggy ride through Central Park. But the horses look so forlorn,
as if it’s the last thing they want to do. And they don’t even get a cut of the
generous take: $40 for a 20-minute ride, $60 for 45 minutes, excluding tip.
If you want a slow, leisurely ride through Central Park, minus the ripe and
frequent smell of horse poop, consider an alternative called Manhattan
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
294

Rickshaw Company (% 212-604-4729). The beast of burden behind the
rickshaw has two legs, and the rate is about $1 a minute.
The Feast of San Gennaro
At one time this was a distinct and genuine Italian feast (see the films
Godfather II and Mean Streets for The Feast in the good old days). Its
decline pretty much has coincided with the decline of Little Italy, a
neighborhood that’s a small shell of what it once was. Now, the Feast is
just an overblown and overcrowded street fair with bad food, cheap red
wine, and games of chance you have no chance of winning. Most of the
original Little Italy residents have left, but the ones who are still there
make sure to clear out during the Feast and let the Bridge and Tunnel
expats take over.
Chapter 18: Ten New York City Experiences to Avoid 295
Getting your car out of the pound
If you come back to the spot on the street where you left your car and it’s not there, it
probably hasn’t been stolen, but towed. You can call the city information number, 
% 311, or call the car pound directly at % 212-971-0770, and the personnel there can
help you track your car in the system. Or, just head for the Manhattan car pound at
Pier 76 on the far West Side (12th Avenue and 38th Street). Take a cab; it’s on the other
side of the busy West Side Highway. The pound is open from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. Mondays,
until midnight on Tuesdays, 24 hours a day Wednesday through Saturday, and on
Sunday from midnight to 6 a.m.
If your car is towed, you should get it out as quickly as possible because the pound
charges you $15 a day for storage after the first day. Granted, this may be cheaper
than what you’re paying at a parking lot, but don’t forget that big fine you already have
to cover.
When you go to the car pound, bring the car’s registration (if it’s not in the glove box)
or rental agreement and your driver’s license. Pound personnel will escort you to the
car, if necessary, to identify it if you don’t have all the required documentation. Oh, and
bring cash (or traveler’s checks). It’s a minimum of $185 to claim your car, and they
don’t take credit cards or personal checks. You don’t have to pay the (additional) $55
parking ticket when you claim your car.
If you think this information sounds like a first-hand account, believe me, it is!

Verizon, and the ones owned by other
companies charge for 411 calls. It’s also
worth noting that Verizon has dropped the
price of a local call from 50¢ to 25¢ at its
own pay phones (except in some hotel lob-
bies and other places out-of-town visitors
congregate). For more sources of informa-
tion, consult “Where to Get More
Information,” later in this appendix.
Internet Access and Cyber Cafes
Some of the hotels I recommend now offer
the option of checking your e-mail even if
you didn’t bring your laptop along; the
alternative is one of the Internet cafes in
town. EasyInternetCafé, 234 W. 42nd St.
between Seventh and Eighth avenues 
(% 212-398-0724 or 212-398-0775; www.
easyinternetcafe.com; open 24
hours), has 800 computers and no mini-
mum charge. The price per minute depends
on the number of people using the facilities:
The more demand, the higher the price, but
it’s always very reasonable. You get a pre-
paid card from a machine for the amount of
money you want, say $3; the card is valid
for 30 days and enables you to log on as
many times as you want at the going rate.
Other choices are NY Computer Café, 247 E.
57th St. between Second and Third
avenues (% 212-872-1704; www.ny
computercafe.com; Open: Mon–Fri 
8 a.m.–11 p.m., Sat 10 a.m.–11 p.m., Sun 
11 a.m.–11 p.m.), which charges $3 per 
15 minutes; and CyberCafe, with two loca-
tions: one at 273 Lafayette St. at Prince
Street (% 212-334-5140; Open: Mon–Fri
8:30 a.m.–10 p.m., Sat–Sun 10 a.m.–10 p.m.)
and the other at 250 W. 49th St. between
Broadway and Eighth Avenue (% 212-333-
4109; Open: Mon–Fri 8:30 a.m.–11 p.m.,
Sat–Sun 11 a.m.–11 p.m.). Its Web site is
www.cyber-cafe.com, and it charges
$6.50 per 30 minutes minimum.
Liquor Laws
The minimum legal age to buy and con-
sume alcoholic beverages in New York 
is 21. Liquor and wine are sold only at
licensed stores, which are open six days a
week. Most are closed Sundays and holi-
days. You can purchase beer at grocery
Appendix: Quick Concierge 297

stores, delis, and supermarkets 24 hours a
day, except on Sundays before noon.
Maps
Transit maps for the subways and buses
are available free at token booths inside
subway stations and at public libraries;
bus maps are also available on the buses.
Free city maps are available at hotels
inside the free city guides. To buy maps of
all kinds, go to Hagstrom Map and Travel
Center, 57 W. 43rd St. between Fifth and
Sixth avenues (% 212-398-1222; Open:
Mon–Fri 9 a.m.–5:30 p.m.). For simple New
York City street maps, go to any of the
bookstores in town.
Newspapers/Magazines
The four major daily newspapers are the
New York Times, the New York Daily News,
the New York Post, and Newsday. Two
weekly newspapers distributed free in 
the city are the New York Press and the
Village Voice (Wednesdays). The New
Yorker is a weekly magazine that publishes
listings of local events, news features, crit-
icism, and short stories. New York maga-
zine, also weekly, publishes news and
commentaries about the city, along with
well-regarded restaurant, film, and theater
reviews. Time Out New York is an indispen-
sable weekly service-oriented magazine
that offers dining, music, and entertain-
ment reviews, shopping news, and insider
advice about living in the city, as well as
an exhaustive compilation of local events.
Pharmacies
Here are two 24-hour pharmacies, both
members of the Duane Reade chain: One is
at Broadway and 57th Street (% 212-541-
9708); the other is at Third Avenue and 74th
Street (% 212-744-2668). In addition, CVS
and Rite Aid have branches throughout the
city. For homeopathic cures and other nat-
ural medicines, try C.O. Bigelow Pharmacy,
414 Sixth Ave. between 8th and 9th streets
(% 212-533-2700).
Police
Dial % 911 for emergencies and % 212-
374-5000 for the phone number of the near-
est police precinct.
Radio Stations
Find National Public Radio on WFUV-FM
90.7, WNYC-AM 820, and WNYC-FM 93.9.
WBAI-FM 99.5 and the cluster of college
radio stations at the lower end of the radio
dial broadcast an interesting mix of music
and talk. WBGO-FM 88.3 plays jazz while
WQHT-FM 97.1 plays hip-hop and R&B.
Find salsa and merengue on the mostly
Spanish-language WSKQ-FM 97.9, classi-
cal on WNYC-FM 93.9, country on WYNY-
FM 107.1, classic rock on WAXQ-FM 104.3,
modern rock on WXRK-FM 92.3, light rock
at WQCD 101.9, top 40 and contemporary
hits at WPLJ-FM 95.5 and WHTZ-FM 100.3,
and oldies at WCBS-FM 101.1. Yankees
games are broadcast on WCBS-AM 880,
and WINS-AM 1010 is an all-news station
that provides traffic and weather reports
every ten minutes. The Mets, Knicks,
Rangers, and Giants are on WFAN-AM 660,
an all-sports station.
Restrooms
Public restroom facilities are located in all
transportation terminals (Grand Central
Terminal, Penn Station, and the Port
Authority Bus Terminal), in Central Park
and Bryant Park, and in the New York
Public Library and some other branch
libraries — but in some of these places,
cleanliness may leave much to be desired.
Department stores, museums, and large
hotels have wonderful restrooms (we love
the ones in Saks Fifth Avenue and at the
Plaza Hotel), as does Trump Tower at 56th
Street and Fifth Avenue. Some large cof-
feeshops, such as Dean & Deluca, Au Bon
Pain, and larger Starbucks, as well as
New York City For Dummies, 4th Edition 
298

some chains such as McDonald’s and
Houlihan’s, also have nice restrooms. If
you see a sign that says, “Restrooms for
customers only,” you may have to buy a
token snack or beverage in order to use
the facilities.
Safety
New York is reasonably safe, much more
so than it was even ten years ago. Still, it’s
a good idea to keep in mind a few basic
tips. The number-one rule is to trust your
instincts: If it feels unsafe, it probably is, so
go elsewhere. Don’t flash money or check
your wallet in public; pickpockets some-
times loiter near ATM machines to fleece
unsuspecting customers. Modesty pays;
keep valuables out of sight. Don’t leave a
purse or jacket with a wallet inside hang-
ing on your chair in a restaurant; someone
could brush by and snag it while you’re
enjoying your meal. Although most hotel
room doors lock automatically these days,
it pays to double-check when you’re
coming and going. Subway stations have
off-hours waiting areas, usually near the
entrances, with camera surveillance; look
for the signs overhead. And whatever you
do, don’t get sucked into those boisterous
three-card monte games being played on
the sidewalk. It’s a big con game — just
think, if these folks had a legitimate opera-
tion going on, they wouldn’t be playing it
on a cardboard box on the street! In the
unlikely and unfortunate event that you are
mugged, don’t be foolish enough to resist.
Give the mugger what he or she wants, get
to a safe place, and call the police.
Smoking
City regulations forbid smoking in all
places of employment and commerce,
including offices, bars, restaurants, public
transportation, taxis, and indoor arenas. A
city tax added to the cost of cigarettes
makes them quite expensive. If you’re a
smoker, bring enough to last your trip, and
expect to duck out to the sidewalk if you’d
like a smoke when you’re at a restaurant,
bar, or club. You’ll have plenty of company
in what’s sometimes called the “Bloomberg
Lounge,” after Mayor Bloomberg, who
pushed the smoking regulations through.
Taxes
Sales tax is 8.625 percent on meals, most
goods, and some services. Hotel tax is
13.25 percent plus $2 per room per night
(including sales tax). Parking garage tax is
18.25 percent.
Taxis
Authorized, legal taxis in Manhattan are
yellow. Yellow cabs have city medallions
posted inside the vehicles that have the
driver’s name and identification number, in
case you need to lodge a complaint (or,
heaven forbid, if you leave something in
the cab and need to track down the driver).
A taxi will cost you $2.50 just for stepping
in the door, plus 40¢ per 1⁄5 mile. The flat
rate from JFK Airport is $45 and a sur-
charge of $1 is applied all rides from 4 to 
8 p.m., Monday through Friday.
Time Zone
New York is on eastern standard/eastern
daylight time.
Tipping
In restaurants in New York City, you can
double the 8.625 percent tax to figure the
appropriate tip. Other tipping guidelines: 
15 percent to 20 percent of the fare to taxi
drivers; 10 percent to 15 percent of the tab
to bartenders; $1 to $2 per bag to bellhops;
at least $1 per day to hotel maids; $1 per
item to checkroom attendants. Tipping the-
ater ushers isn’t expected.
Transit Info
For ground transportation to and from all
the area airports, call Air-Ride (% 800-
247-7433). For all transit information, call
the MTA (Metropolitan Transit Authority)

I packed this book with information, but if you still haven’t had enough,
you can consult the following resources for additional info.
Tourist information offices
NYC & Company (the former Convention and Visitors Bureau) offers a
24-hour telephone hotline (% 800-NYC-VISIT or 212-397-8222) that you
can call to order a kit, which includes a 100-page Big Apple Visitor Guide
plus a map and other materials; you pay only shipping, and you should
receive the kit in seven days. The guide, which you can order separately
(and for free), contains tons of information about hotels, restaurants,
theaters, events, and so on and is updated quarterly. NYC & Co. also
maintains a Visitor Information Center at 810 Seventh Ave. between
52nd and 53rd streets (% 212-484-1222; Open: Mon–Fri 8:30 a.m.–6 p.m.,
weekends and holidays 9 a.m.–5 p.m.; Mailing address: 810 Seventh Ave.,
New York, NY 10019).
You can get information about current theater productions over the
phone through NYC/On Stage (% 212-768-1818) and the Broadway
Line (% 888-BROADWAY, 212-563-2929, or 212-302-4111).
For all transit information, call the MTA Transit Information Center
(% 718-330-1234). Call % 718-330-3322 for a copy of Token Trips Travel
Guide, a brochure that gives you instructions on how to get to New York
City’s main attractions via mass transit.
Air-Ride (% 800-247-7433) is a service that provides recorded informa-
tion about ground transportation from all the area airports.
Newspapers and Magazines
New York City has four daily newspapers: the New York Times, www.ny
times.com (registration required); The Daily News, www.nydailynews.
com; the New York Post, www.nypost.com; and Newsday, www.newsday.
com. Each paper offers daily calendars of events and usually runs full
sections of weekend listings on Fridays.

The best weekly magazines for information and listings about upcoming
events are Time Out New York, www.timeoutny.com; and New York mag-
azine, www.newyorkmag.com; and The New Yorker, www.newyorker.com.
The weekly free newspaper, The Village Voice, www.villagevoice.com
has extensive listings with staff picks and recommendations.
The following are some of the more useful online sources:
 Citysearch (www.newyork.citysearch.com) is a comprehensive,
user-friendly site that lists tons of entertainment and dining
prospects. The listings are ample, and the reviews quite useful.
Citysearch is now associated with NYC & Company (found later in
this list).
 The MTA (Metropolitan Transit Authority) (www.mta.info ) site
provides easy access to bus and subway maps and information.
 New York City Reference (www.panix.com/clay/nyc) is an excel-
lent index of links to other New York–related Web sites — a couple
thousand of them — such as the Web sites of all the museums in
New York.
 NYC & Company, New York City’s official tourism site (www.nyc
visit.com), is the Web site of the former Convention and Visitors
Bureau; it provides a wealth of information and links, and you can
book hotels online with a few clicks of your mouse.
 NYC.gov (www.nyc.gov) is the official site of the city of New York.
It’s very comprehensive and clear and has a bunch of useful links
to sightseeing and entertainment information.
 www.nyctourist.com offers an excellent selection of very useful
information, although it’s a little more commercial than the other
Web sites I list.
 Frommer’s Web site (www.frommers.com) offers much of the con-
tent from Frommer’s guidebooks, as well as online updates of
changes in the area since the guidebook was published. You can
also subscribe to an Internet newsletter that spotlights travel deals
and offers articles and service information on destinations world-
wide. Message boards are available for travelers to ask for and
share traveling tips.
If you’re looking for additional guidebooks on New York City, I can rec-
ommend (and I wrote!) Frommer’s New York City, and Frommer’s Portable
New York City. Also check out Suzy Gershman’s Born to Shop New York
City, and Frommer’s Memorable Walks in New York City (both published
by Wiley, too).
