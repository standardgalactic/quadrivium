the company used reliability surveys of earlier 
Surface devices (including Surface 3, Surface

to a report (go.pcworld.com/atr) the 
publication released recently.

shows that while return rates of products like 
the Surface Pro 3 and Surface Book were 
initially atrocious, they improved substantially 
over time. Later Surfaces, like the Surface Hub, 
also never really suffered from the same issues. 
In addition to removing its “recommended” 
rating from four Microsoft Surface devices, 
Consumer Reports stated it wouldn’t 
recommend any Surface products at all. 
Devices receiving the no-confidence vote 
include the Microsoft Surface Laptop, with 
128GB and 256GB of storage, and the 
Microsoft Surface Book, with 128GB and 
512GB of storage. Consumer Reports also 
predicted that 25 percent of all Surface 
laptops and tablets will generate problems 
within the first two years of ownership. 
Though it named four specific products, a 
Consumer Reports spokesman said it was 
penalizing the Surface brand as a 
whole. “We can’t recommend 
any of [Microsoft’s] laptops or 
tablets until we get data that 
shows better reliability,” a 
Consumer Reports spokesman 
said in an email.
Microsoft, for its part, said 
that the company respectfully 
disagreed with Consumer 
Reports’ findings, and that its 
real-world return and support 
rates are on a par with competing 
devices and “significantly lower 
than 25 percent,” Microsoft 
Devices corporate vice president Panos Panay 
wrote (go.pcworld.com/pp). 
Why this matters: Consumer Reports 
extrapolated reliability reports from products 
like the Surface 3, Surface Pro 3, and early 
Surface Book—all of which suffered from 
some hardware flaws—to unrelated products 
like the Surface Laptop, which wasn’t even in 
production during the time of the survey.
The question is whether, in an analogous 
situation, a Chevrolet Malibu sedan that had 
suffered repeated manufacturing defects would 
cause the publication to stop recommending 
the Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck. While a 
specific warning about the Surface Book might 
be defensible, claiming that a quarter of Book 
and Laptop buyers will experience problems 
seems like a leap of logic.
Consumer Reports pulled its recommendation of the Surface 
Laptop, even though the notebook wasn’t covered in the survey.

CAN PAST SURFACE 
PERFORMANCE 
PREDICT THE FUTURE?
Consumer Reports, which bases its reliability 
reports on surveys that it sends to its 
subscribers, compiled data on 90,741 tablets 
and laptops that its members bought from 
2014 until the beginning of 2017, it said. That 
data included devices from a variety of 
manufacturers, including Microsoft Surface 
devices.
The reliability predictions represent 
extrapolations made from data reported on 
older devices, such as the Surface 3, Surface 
Pro 3, and other devices sold during that 
time, the CR report said. Actual problems that 
consumers experienced included freezing or 
unexpected shutdowns, and touchscreens 
that weren’t responsive enough, the 
publication said. Using that past data, 
Consumer Reports then generated a reliability 
rating for the brand as a whole.
“Essentially, our analysis isn’t of the 
Surface laptops or any specific model line or 
family,” a Consumer Reports spokesman 
explained in an email. “Rather we conduct 
annual laptops and tablets brand reliability 
surveys. We are not making claims about a 
specific laptop or tablet model released at a 
specific point in time. We are making 
reliability predictions at the brand level, 
based on the devices purchased between 
2014 and the first quarter of 2017.”
The spokesman acknowledged the 
problem with using past data on a new 
product that wasn’t even shipping when the 
survey took place. “It’s not 100 percent 
perfect,” the spokesman said of the 
publication’s methodology.
Still, the spokesman added, it represents 
the best data the 
company has on the 
brand as a whole. “Our 
analysis revealed that 
Microsoft as a brand has 
a comparatively worse 
reliability rate than other 
brands, so we can’t 
recommend Microsoft 
tablets and computers—
no matter the model 
family,” the Consumer 
Reports spokesman 
said. “This wouldn’t

necessarily change if Microsoft came out with 
a brand-new tablet or computer next week.”
Consumer Reports’ findings surprised 
many at Microsoft and elsewhere, which had 
seen steadily increasing reliability metrics from 
generation to generation. Surface Pro 3 
owners had struggled through battery issues 
(go.pcworld.com/bi1) and overheating (go.
pcworld.com/oh), while the Surface Pro 4 and 
Surface Book suffered screen flickering (go.
pcworld.com/sf) and their own power 
problems (go.pcworld.com/pip). But by 2017, 
the Surface Book had become fairly reliable.
Given that the Surface Laptop began 
shipping in June, after the survey concluded, 
many wondered how Consumer Reports 
could reach its conclusions. “I own and have 
used every version of Surface products for 
extensive periods of times, not just reviews,” 
Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor 
Insights, said in an email. Moorhead’s 
experiences, while anecdotal, are far more 
positive. “Since 2012 I have only had an issue 
with two systems: software issues with 
Windows RT systems in 2012 and in 2016 with 
the first batch of Skylake-based systems. After 
six months, the Skylake driver issues 
disappeared.”
Moorhead’s largely trouble-free 
experience extends to Microsoft’s latest 
models. “I have both the Surface Pro (5) and 
Surface laptop and have not experienced an 
issue with stock (non-beta) software.”
CONSUMER REPORTS HAS 
BEEN HERE BEFORE
Consumer Reports is no stranger to controversy. 
The publication made headlines earlier this year 
when it said it uncovered issues with the battery 
life of Apple’s MacBook Pro (go.pcworld.com/
amb). Its testing used a developer setting that 
included an undiscovered bug (go.pcworld.
com/bug), however, which affected its results. 
Those tests prompted CR to withhold a buying 
recommendation, though CR later reinstated the 
recommendation after the bug was resolved. 
Microsoft has its own side of the story. The 
company maintains an internal testing facility 
and generates its own estimates of how its 
Surface devices compare to its competition—
which is basically Apple. Its internal defect rate 
was “not even close” to 25 percent, according 
to Microsoft employees. Surface Computing 
vice president Panos Panay wrote that the 
“incidents per unit” were less than 1 percent, 
or presumably less than 1 out of 100 devices.
Consumer Reports noted that it ranked the 
new Surface Pro very highly in recent tests, 
including display quality, battery life, speed, 
and ergonomics. (PCWorld’s Surface Pro 
review [go.pcworld.com/psp] nicked the 
tablet for lack of innovation, while our Surface 
Book review [go.pcworld.com/sbr] was more 
positive). The CR spokesman also acknowl-
edged in an email that models within a brand 
may vary, and that changes in design and 
manufacturing might affect future reliability. By 
then, though, the damage had been done.

Facepalm: Intel’s upcoming 
Coffee Lake CPUs won’t work 
with today’s motherboards
Builders and upgraders are crying foul as they lose their ability to upgrade-in-place 
on an older motherboard. BY GORDON MAH UNG
G
et ready to facepalm, Intel fans. 
The company’s upcoming 
Coffee Lake CPUs apparently 
won’t work with existing stocks 
of motherboards, a manufacturer confirmed 
on Wednesday.
In a Twitter post by Asrock last Saturday, 
the company flat-out said the new CPU won’t 
work with today’s motherboards. 
When asked by Evan Jensen “...will the 
Z270 Supercarrier get support for the 
upcoming @intel Coffee Lake CPU’s?” 
Asrock’s official twitter account, @ASRockInfo 
replied: “No, Coffee Lake CPU is not

compatible with 200-series motherboards.”
PCWorld reached out to Asrock for 
comment on the tweet but has not heard 
back. Intel officials declined to comment on 
the statement by Asrock, saying that it doesn’t 
comment on future products.
So was the post just a rogue and 
uninformed social media post? A hack? 
Nope.
According to at least one reliable source 
outside of Intel, the new Coffee Lake CPU will 
indeed not be compatible with Z270 boards, 
even though the chipsets with the upcoming 
Z370 appear to be the same, PCWorld was 
told.
The source added that there are hopes in 
the industry that Intel will change its mind on 
compatibility. Tomshardware.com said it had 
independently confirmed (go.pcworld.com/
ic) the news with Asrock officials as well. 
Why this matters: The vast majority of new 
CPU sales are in new systems, and they likely 
won’t be impacted by the incompatibility. 
However, there’s also a very large and very 
vocal crowd of builders and upgraders who 
still swap out older, slower CPUs for newer, 
faster CPUs to maximize their investment. An 
upgrade-in-place doesn’t sell an Intel chipset, 
but it at least keeps them on the Intel 
platform. If consumers are forced to dump an 
existing Z270 motherboard for a newer Z370 
to get a six-core Coffee Lake CPU, Intel risks 
driving them into the arms of AMD and its 
Ryzen CPUs.
WHY INTEL, WHY?
Again, Intel officials would not comment, but 
there are many reasons for such a move.
The most cynical reason is “market 
segmentation,” which is a fancy way of saying 
Motherboard maker ASRock says Z270 owners will not be able to run Intel’s upcoming Coffee Lake CPU.

SEPTEMBER 2017   PCWorld   13
the company just wants consumers to buy a 
new motherboard with the new CPU.
Another reason is support issues. Intel is 
an engineering-conservative company and 
doesn’t like to say CPUs will work with 
something unless all of the t’s are crossed and 
the i’s dotted. It’s entirely possible that Coffee 
Lake could officially support Z370 only, but 
unofficially work just fine with previous 
chipsets and motherboards. Intel has done 
this with previous generations of CPUs by 
unofficially allowing motherboard vendors to 
support them.
Of course, there’s also the chance that it 
really isn’t compatible. Although Coffee Lake 
is based on the same 14nm process as Kaby 
Lake and Skylake and appears to use the 
same chipset, it’s believed to be Intel’s 
first six-core chip in a mainstream 
platform. More cores means more 
power consumption, and Intel 
may never have planned 
for the Z270 to 
support the 
power 
requirements for 
Coffee Lake.
Motherboard makers are 
likely unhappy with the news, too. As word 
spreads that Z270 won’t work with the next 
CPU, consumers, especially enthusiasts, may 
decide against buying a Z270-based 
product, knowing that’s its essentially 
outdated. If the new CPU were compatible, 
that stampede is less likely to occur.
In some ways, Asrock’s slip of the tongue 
could convince Intel to change its mind on 
compatibility. As of this morning, Asrock’s 
Twitter post had not been removed.
No matter what the reason, the news 
couldn’t come at a worse possible time. With 
the company under full assault by AMD’s 
Ryzen (go.pcworld.com/amdr) and Ryzen 
Threadripper (go.pcworld.com/rts), keeping 
the base happy and loyal is a given. 
If you have an ASRock Z270 Extreme 4 board, 
you’re apparently out of luck on a Coffee Lake 
upgrade.

Microsoft slips four more

Update isn’t quite over. BY MARK HACHMAN

icrosoft isn’t quite finished 
developing (go.pcworld.
com/fd) Windows 10’s Fall 
Creators Update after all: 
Four new features were added as part of 
Windows 10 Insider Build 16251, including 
new Cortana capabilities and more 
communication between Windows and 
your phone.
If there’s a theme to the new build (go.
pcworld.com/nbr), it’s following up on 
promises that Microsoft made earlier. At its 

SEPTEMBER 2017   PCWorld   15
Build developer 
conference, Microsoft 
promised that phones and 
Windows would begin to 
communicate with one 
another, so tasks begun on 
the phone could be 
completed on the desktop. 
Voice commands to shut 
down and reboot your PC 
have also been enabled via 
Cortana—who now has 
greater freedom to provide 
answers without launching 
a browser. Finally, if you do 
need to reboot your PC, 
you can program your PC 
to skip the authentication process.
Why this matters: Microsoft pledged to 
make the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update a 
tool for connectivity as much as creativity, with 
several key features (go.pcworld.com/svf) 
that are slowly rolling out to Insiders. (Several, 
such as Timeline, we have yet to see, 
however.) Personally, I like Cortana’s new 
capabilities more than anything else, though 
the phone-to-PC connectivity is a welcome 
foundation for future improvements.
CORTANA’S PANE  
IN THE SIDE
One of Cortana’s minor annoyances is that 
when she can’t display the answer as a card 
or a short reply, she’ll automatically launch 
an Edge webpage. To me, this always felt 
like giving up. Now, Cortana will slide out an 
additional pane with, say, a weather forecast 
(as you can see in the image above). If there 
is no card available, she’ll show the result 
with a little arrow next to it to launch a 
webpage. 
You’ll notice that the pane looks like a 
webpage, with the traditional Bing 
navigation elements along the top of the 
pane. The only controversy here is that 
Cortana won’t launch a webpage anymore 
without your input. If this annoys you, 
incidentally, you can leave feedback for 
Microsoft by way of the in-Cortana 
feedback tool.
Cortana now slides out a preview pane.

FALL CREATORS UPDATE
NOW EVERYONE CAN  
TELL CORTANA TO SHUT  
UP DOWN
In Insider Build 14986, Microsoft included the 
capability to turn off your PC orally with a 
Cortana command. Well, apparently. With 
Build 16251, Microsoft said it “fully enabled” 
it. Now, you can lock, sign out, shut down, or 
turn off your PC. To prevent mischievous 
coworkers, friends, or YouTube videos from 
messing with you, some of the voice 
commands require an additional oral 
confirmation.
PICK UP WHERE YOU LEFT 
OFF…ON YOUR ANDROID 
PHONE
For years, Microsoft’s vision of the future was 
that your phone was your PC. Now, with 
Windows Phones essentially dead (go.
pcworld.com/ped), that vision has evolved to 
your phone mirroring your PC. While Word 
and other Office apps can be found on your 
PC as well as your phone, however, your web 
browsers haven’t talked to one another. Now 
they do.
In the new build, you can take your 
Android phones—yes, Android—open a 
webpage, then share the page to your PC 
using the native Share button. It’s not 
automatic, probably because 
Android’s Chrome browser doesn’t 
natively talk to Edge. You’ll have a 
choice: either Continue Later, and the 
webpage will be stored within the 
Action Center, or Continue Now, 
which will automatically open up the 
webpage within Edge.
Note that the existing Creators 
Update allows your Android phone to 
alert your PC if the phone has low 
battery, or respond to messages. That 
capability requires Cortana to be 
running on both the phone and the PC. 
With the new build, you don’t need

Microsoft hasn’t just eliminated the login

Microsoft will save 
Microsoft Paint, making it  
a downloadable app
Paint and Paint 3D will continue to live in peace. BY MARK HACHMAN
S
tand down, everyone: Microsoft 
Paint isn’t going away after all.
Microsoft signaled an about-
face in a recent blog post (go.
pcworld.com/bpp) by Megan Saunders, a 
general manager within the Windows 
Experiences group. Instead of deprecating 
Paint in Windows 10 (go.pcworld.com/
dpw)—which seemed to many to be the first 
step toward oblivion—Saunders said 
Microsoft would release MS Paint in the 
Windows Store as a free app. “MS Paint is 
here to stay, it will just have a new home soon, 
in the Windows Store where it will be 
available for free,” Saunders wrote.
Saunders acknowledged the pleas of 
Paint fans who didn’t want this longtime app 
to go away. “Today, we’ve seen an incredible 
outpouring of support and nostalgia around 
MS Paint,” Saunders wrote. Her next words

were almost sentimental, as she affirmed 
Paint’s continuing existence: “If there’s 
anything we learned, it’s that after 32 years, 
MS Paint has a lot of fans. It’s been amazing to 
see so much love for our trusty old app.”
Microsoft had previously classified the Paint 
app as “deprecated” within the upcoming 
Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, meaning 
Microsoft would officially cease development 
on it, and it could be removed from the OS 
either with the release of the FCU or in the 
future. It seems Microsoft still plans to remove 
it—yet allow users access to it if they so choose. 
Saunders didn’t say when Paint would be 
transitioned over to a Store app, nor did she 
mention whether it would still be developed—
or just preserved in amber. Saunders did say 
that Paint3D, Microsoft’s new 3D content 
creation app, will remain and receive updates 
in the future.
Paint was born with Windows 1.0 in 1985, 
as a licensed version of ZSoft’s PC Paintbrush 
(go.pcworld.com/zpc). Microsoft updated 
Paint over subsequent versions, adding 
support for JPEG, TIFF, and other file formats. 
Though far more sophisticated imaging tools 
have risen around it, Paint always served as a 
quick-and-dirty photo editor and drawing tool. 
Why this matters: We’ll never know whether 
Microsoft always planned to bring Paint back as 
a Store app, but there’s no doubt it kick-saved 
what appeared to be an embarrassing goal 
against the company. Whether it be a head-
scratching Solitaire subscription (go.pcworld.
com/sss) or just the preservation of a beloved 
utility, the lesson is clear: PC users don’t like 
their apps being messed with, Microsoft.

Confirmed: Windows 10 may 
cut off devices with older CPUs
Microsoft’s policy puts all older hardware at risk. BY MARK HACHMAN
N
o Windows 10 Creators Update 
for you, Microsoft says—at 
least, not if you happen to be 
the unlucky owner of certain 
older Atom-based Windows devices, and 
other aging models in the future. After stories 
arose of failed attempts to upgrade (go.
pcworld.com/tu) such hardware to the 
Creators Update, Microsoft confirmed 
recently that any hardware device that falls out 
of the manufacturer’s support cycle may be 
ineligible for future Windows 10 updates.
In the case of the four “Clover Trail” 
processors (go.pcworld.com/ctx)—part of 
the Cloverview platform—that have fallen into 
Intel’s End of Interactive Support phase, they 
will be ineligible for the Windows 10 Creators 
Update, Microsoft confirmed. Instead, they’ll

SEPTEMBER 2017   PCWorld   21
simply be offered the Windows 10 
Anniversary Update, plus security updates 
through January 2023, the end of the original 
Windows 8.1 support period.
The problem, however, is that Microsoft’s 
language opens up the possibility that any 
unsupported hardware device could be 
excluded from future Windows 10 updates. 
“Recognizing that a combination of hardware, 
driver and firmware support is required to 
have a good Windows 10 experience, we 
updated our support lifecycle policy to align 
with the hardware support period for a given 
device,” Microsoft said in a statement. “If a 
hardware partner stops supporting a given 
device or one of its key components and 
stops providing driver updates, firmware 
updates, or fixes, it may mean that device will 
not be able to properly run a future Windows 
10 feature update.”  
Why this matters: For years, the rule of 
thumb was that you could run virtually any 
operating system on top of any Intel or AMD 
(or even Cyrix) hardware. Chances are that it 
would run, if slowly. Over time, though, 
things changed. As malware became more 
potent, running a supported Windows 
operating system became more important. 
Now, there’s Windows as a Service: If 
Windows 10 never really goes away, what 
limits PC builders is supported hardware, 
apparently. Now we have to worry about how 
long all of our PC hardware components 
are supported, lest we lose access to 
upcoming versions of Windows 10.
IS THIS MORE THAN 
SWEEPING ATOM UNDER 
THE RUG?
Microsoft appears to be doubling down on its 
belief that up-to-date hardware requires an 
updated operating system, and vice versa. 
Microsoft said last year (go.pcworld.com/ly1) 
that it would restrict the latest Intel Kaby Lake 
and AMD Ryzen silicon to Windows 10. 
Recently, the company has blocked patches 
(go.pcworld.com/bp) on PCs that try to run 
older Windows operating systems on modern 
hardware.
“As new silicon generations are 
introduced, they will require the latest 
Windows platform at that time for support,” 
Microsoft said in January, 2016. “This enables 
us to focus on deep integration between 
Windows and the silicon, while maintaining 
maximum reliability and compatibility with 
previous generations of platform and silicon.” 
Microsoft’s Clover Trail stance sets limits 
on what those previous generations can 
expect. If a processor platform falls out of 
support by a chip vendor, Microsoft may drop 
it from its OS list. 
What’s unclear, though, is whether 
Microsoft’s new position represents a funda-
mental shift in policy, or a rather narrow focus 
on Intel’s troubled Atom processors. At  
one time, Atom’s “Clover Trail” architecture 

22   PCWorld   SEPTEMBER 2017

WINDOWS 10
(go.pcworld.com/acta) represented the future 
of Intel processors within the smartphone and 
tablet markets. But Intel could never quite 
develop the system-on-chip with logic and 
communications that rivals like ARM provided, 
and Intel essentially killed the Atom (go.
pcworld.com/iek) platform in 2016. Without a 
healthy customer base to support, Intel 
apparently decided to refocus its resources 
away from the Clover Trail architecture.
Devices that use Intel’s Clover Trail chips 
“require additional hardware support to 
provide the best possible experience when 
updating to the latest Windows 10 feature 
update, the Windows 10 Creators Update,” 
Microsoft said in a statement. “However, 
these systems are no longer supported by 
Intel…and without the necessary driver 
support, they may be incapable of moving to 
the Windows 10 Creators Update without a 
potential performance impact.”
Specifically, the Clover Trail chips have 
moved into the “End of Interactive Support,” 
(EOIS) which is defined (go.pcworld.com/
def) as “Intel Customer Support Agents no 
longer respond to telephone, chat, 
community support forums, or email inquiries 
for this product.” Self-help is provided by 
Intel’s support community, generally made up 
of other users.
What’s worrying about Microsoft’s 
statement, though, is its broadness. 
Conceivably, any “device”—microprocessor, 
hard drive, network controller, sound card, 
headphones, monitor, and more—that a 
manufacturer discontinues or fails to actively 
support could drop out of Windows updates. 
While this would certainly encourage new PC 
and hardware purchases, it would also 
infuriate millions of PC users whose otherwise-
functional legacy devices fell by the wayside.
A related question is whether Microsoft will 
refuse to support any other Intel processors that 
have reached EOIS status. Intel has published 
an enormous list of legacy Core processors (go.
pcworld.com/lcp) on its site, which includes 
dozens if not hundreds of chips that have 
already fallen into the EOIS bin. The most 
recent EOIS chip appears to be the Core 
i7-990X, a 32-nm Gulftown processor most 
recently sold during the first quarter of 2011. But 
chips including the Ivy Bridge (2012) archi-
tecture are already at end-of-life status, and 
presumably headed for EOIS status next. It’s not 
clear whether moving a chip to an EOIS status is 
decided on a chip-by-chip basis, or if there’s a 
fixed timeline by which chips move from offi- 
cially supported to end-of-life and then to EOIS.
Intel representatives declined to comment 
on whether other chips beyond the four 
Clover Trail processors were affected, 
referring questions to Microsoft.  
If there’s an upside, it’s that Microsoft said 
it will actively work with chip vendors to find 
support for older hardware. “We know issues 
like this exist and we actively work to identify 
the best support path for older hardware,” 
Microsoft’s statement added.

Adobe Flash will die by 2020, 
Adobe and browser makers say
Now about Java… BY MARK HACHMAN
A
dobe Flash, one of the most 
controversial elements of the 
web, will be phased out by 
2020, Adobe said recently. 
Browser makers, including Microsoft and 
Google, simultaneously announced plans for 
a gradual phaseout over the next few years.
Adobe said that enough progress had 
been made within open web standards like 
HTML5 that it was time to phase out Flash. 
“Adobe and Macromedia provided 
innovation to the web, through browser 
plug-ins, before the underlying web 
standards could support the interactivity and 
creativity our digital media publishers and 
consumers craved,” the company said in a 
blog post (go.pcworld.com/bpo). “By the 
end of 2020, we firmly believe that all of these

required media capabilities and standards will 
be widely deployed and natively available to 
customers within browsers.”
Specifically, Adobe Flash Player will be 
end-of-lifed by 2020, the company said, 
meaning that it simply won’t work. That will 
have dramatic effects on sites like 
Newgrounds, which evolved into a repository 
for Flash-authored (and HTML5) content. 
Facebook also addressed the issue of Flash-
based games running on its site; while those 
games will work until 2020, the company 
urged developers to shift to HTML5 as soon 
as possible.
For many, though, Flash was simply seen 
at least as a nuisance, and at worst a serious 
security risk. 
Flash-based exploits have circulated for 
years, in a game of cat-and-mouse between 
hackers and Adobe itself. Apple’s Steve Jobs 
famously banned Flash from the iPhone (go.
pcworld.com/fip), claiming that Flash hurt 
battery life and also was a security risk. In 
2015, for example, hackers jumped on a Flash 
exploit (go.pcworld.com/fe) as an 
opportunity to infect computers with 
In 2015, Mozilla’s Firefox blocked Flash by default.

malware. In response, Mozilla’s Firefox 
blocked Flash by default (go.pcworld.com/
mfb) until Adobe issued a patch. Security 
issues aside, PCWorld also found that Flash 
slowed down browsers (go.pcworld.com/
fsd) by as much as 80 percent.
Over time, browser makers either began 
blocking Flash by default or at least asking 
users to enable it, a feature known as click-to-
run. Today, sites need to ask your permission 
to run Flash within Google Chrome and 
Microsoft Edge. (Edge remembers your 
choice for future visits.)
BROWSER MAKERS  
ACT FAST
In a blog post (go.pcworld.com/bpx), 
Microsoft laid out its timeline for phasing 
out Flash support from Edge:
>  Through the end of 2017 and into 2018, 
Microsoft Edge will continue to ask users 
for permission to run Flash on most sites the 
first time the site is visited, and will 
remember the user’s preference on 
subsequent visits. Internet Explorer will 
continue to allow Flash with no special 
permissions required during this time.
>  In mid to late 2018, Microsoft will update 
Microsoft Edge to require permission for 
Flash to be run each session. Internet 
Explorer will continue to allow Flash for 
all sites in 2018.
>  In mid to late 2019, Microsoft will disable 
Flash by default in both Microsoft Edge 
and Internet Explorer. Users will be able to 
re-enable Flash in both browsers. When 
re-enabled, Microsoft Edge will continue 
to require approval for Flash on a 
site-by-site basis.
>  By the end of 2020, Microsoft will remove 
the ability to run Adobe Flash in Microsoft 
Edge and Internet Explorer across all 
supported versions of Microsoft Windows. 
Users will no longer have any ability to 
enable or run Flash.
Google said that it will quietly phase out 
Flash as well, though the process will go on 
quietly behind the scenes. “If the site migrates 
to open web standards, you shouldn’t notice 
much difference except that you’ll no longer 
see prompts to run Flash on that site,” Google 
said in a blog post (go.pcworld.com/bpy) by 
Anthony Laforge, a product manager with 
Google Chrome. “If the site continues to use 
Flash, and you give the site permission to run 
Flash, it will work through the end of 2020.”
What this means for you: Little, if anything. 
Browser makers are bending over backward 
to ensure that your browser encounters as 
little Flash as possible before it’s phased out 
in 2020. Flash had its day, but its time has 
come.

Ryzen Threadripper: AMD’s 
monster stomps on other CPUs
AMD’s monster CPU stomps and smashes punier competition. BY GORDON MAH UNG
A
MD’s 16-core, 32-thread Ryzen 
Threadripper 1950X ($999 on 
Amazon, go.pcworld.com/
a50) is an angry Godzilla 
stomping his way through downtown Tokyo. 
Those puny 8-core, 6-core, and 4-core CPUs? 
They’re just tanks and army trucks to be 
punted across the city. 
Yes, it’s that good. But before you buy, 
there’s a lot you need to know about what is 
arguably the most powerful consumer CPU 
ever unleashed upon mankind. 
WHAT IS THREADRIPPER?
Ryzen Threadripper’s name tells you its 
lineage: the ground-breaking Ryzen 7 (go.
pcworld.com/r7), Ryzen 5 (go.pcworld.

AMD RYZEN THREADRIPPER
its cores, AMD has designed Ryzen to be 
modular at the chip level. The basic building 
block of all Ryzen CPUs are two 4-core 
complexes, or CCXes, joined by AMD’s 
high-speed Infinity Fabric interconnect. Every 
Ryzen 7, for example, has an 8-core die.
To get to 16 cores in Threadripper, AMD 
uses the same high-speed Infinity Fabric to 
join two 8-core dies. The 12-core version also 
joins two 8-core dies, but each of the 4-core 
CCXs has one processor core disabled.
But wait: You’ve seen pictures of the inside 
of a Threadripper and there are four chips—are 
those two other 8-core dies just waiting to be 
enabled? Nope. It’s no secret that Threadripper 
reuses hardware from AMD’s 32-core, server-
focused Epyc CPU (go.pcworld.com/ecpu), 
but AMD isn’t giving us 32-core consumer 
CPUs today. Two of those “chips” are actually 
dummy pieces to add structural support for the 
cooler that will be clamped onto the CPU.
WITH GREAT CORES, COME 
GREAT RESOURCES
AMD actually doubles down twice with 
Threadripper specs, giving you double the 
amount of CPU cores and double the amount 
of memory channels. It also vastly increases 
the PCIe lanes.
For example, the mainstream Ryzen line 
supports dual-channel DDR4 memory. 
AMD’s new Ryzen Threadripper is based on the same dual 4-core complex (CCX), so instead of one chip, 
you get two.
But wait: You’ve seen pictures 
of the inside of a Threadripper 
and there are four chips—are 
those two other 8-core dies just 
waiting to be enabled? Nope. 

SEPTEMBER 2017   PCWorld   29
Threadripper supports quad-channel DDR4. 
Unlike Intel, whose strategy is to disable 
features on its Core-series CPUs to push 
people to its pricier Xeon chips, AMD leaves 
in support for ECC RAM to help correct 
single-bit errors. AMD also says Threadripper 
should technically be able to support up to 
2TB of RAM, although the company hasn’t 
validated this because there are no DIMMs 
that support the capacity yet.
As for PCIe, while the mainstream Ryzen 
chips offer a pedestrian 20 lanes for support of 
graphics cards or SSDs, Threadripper offers a 
whopping 64 lanes. Of those 64, four are used 
to connect to the south bridge, leaving 60 
available to connect up to seven different 
simultaneous PCIe devices. That means up to 
four GPUs along with three NVMe PCIe drives.
Compare AMD’s generous approach to 
Intel’s careful rationing: The $1,000 (go.
pcworld.com/amdg) 10-core Core i9-7900X 
(go.pcworld.com/ci97), for example, has a 
decent 44 lanes of PCIe, but the $599 8-core 
Core i7-7820X has only 28. Even AMD’s 
cheapest Threadripper so far, the 8-core 
Threadripper 1900X, features a full 64 lanes of 
PCIe support.

AMD RYZEN THREADRIPPER
large lineup of Threadripper CPUs, AMD is 
officially launching only three CPUs today (the 
8-core Threadripper 1900X will ship in a few 
more weeks). The lineup (see on the 
preveious page and below) is sparser than 
Intel’s currently, but an unintentional leak (go.
pcworld.com/ul by motherboard vendors 
indicates the company has lower-wattage, 
non-“X” versions coming, too.
Intel’s own lineup looks more impressive, 
but thus far, the company has shipped only 
the 10-core Core i9-7900X and its 8-core, 
6-core, and 4-core siblings. 
INSTALLATION: READ THE 
MANUAL. SERIOUSLY.
No matter how many systems you’ve built, if 
you buy Threadripper, do yourself a favor and 
read the manual. As expected, Threadripper 
brings a new CPU socket, officially called 
sTR4. While the mainstream Ryzen features 
the pin-grid array familiar with AMD fans, 
Threadripper moves to an LGA, or land-grid 
array, that will be more familiar to Intel fans.
LGA moves the delicate pins to the 
motherboard instead of the CPU. Which is 
better? From a customer point of view, it 
probably depends. Mash a pin on a $550 
motherboard badly, and you trash the 
motherboard. Mash it on a $999 CPU, and 
you trash the CPU. 
One thing we do know: Installing a 
Threadripper is unlike anything you’ve done 
before. That doesn’t mean you need to sweat 
bullets, but don’t just dive into it without first

proper installation video (go.pcworld.com/iv) 
(preferably not ours (go.pcworld.com/noo), 
which we did dead-tired and blind).
The three essential takeaways from your 
manual-reading and video-watching should 
be these:
•  You must keep the plastic orange carrier 
on the CPU. The CPU can’t be installed 
without it.
•  You must use the torque wrench that’s 
packed into the bottom of the Threadripper 
box (see above). 
•  Pay attention to the correct sequence for 
installing and uninstalling the CPU.
To install it, you open the socket by loosening 
three T20 Torx screws with the AMD-provided 
wrench. Remove the top-level protective plate 
and insert the entire CPU with the orange plastic 
carrier. Slide the CPU until it clicks into place or is 
clearly at the bottom of the assembly.
Once you’re sure the CPU is in the carrier 
correctly, remove the protective cover over 
the socket and gently lower 
the CPU into place. Finally, you 
carefully tighten all three Torx 
screws with the provided 
AMD torque wrench.
One more time: Don’t try 
to muddle through this 
without at least familiarizing 
yourself with the process.
MEET THE NEW 
GAME MODE
Before we get to the all-
important performance 
Failure to use the included torque wrench could 
result in a machine that won’t POST. AMD also 
includes an adapter bracket that fits many popular 
Asetek-based coolers.
There are two covers in the sTR4 socket. Leave the black one that 
protects the delicate pins until you’re ready to put the CPU in place.

AMD RYZEN THREADRIPPER
section, you should know about 
Threadripper’s new Gaming Mode. Most 
people don’t buy 16-core CPUs to play video 
games, but the world is a-changing, and 
many professional gamers and streamers 
need the ability to play games at high frame 
rates and also edit the content once it’s done.
When it designed Threadripper, AMD 
says it realized the high-thread-count CPU 
didn’t always perform at its best for some 
games. Remember, it’s made using two 
separate chips, each with its own dual-
channel memory controller. Out of the box, 
Threadripper supports Uniform Memory 
Access mode, which spreads the memory 
access between both memory controllers. 
The benefit is greater memory bandwidth, 
but often higher latency. Some games, AMD 
says, just want low latency.
To address this, AMD has introduced a 
new Game Mode that switches the system to 
Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA), or 
what AMD calls Local Mode. Local Mode 
essentially shunts all memory access to one 
memory controller to lower latency. Memory 
access that goes to the other memory 
controller is possible, but it’s done with 
higher latency.
Threadripper’s crazy core count has 
another unintended consequence: AMD 
says some older games crashed in its tests. 
This isn’t a problem with Threadripper, 
AMD notes, but the games themselves, 
because they just can’t handle the number 
of CPU cores.
To address this problem, Game Mode 
essentially tells Windows to recognize only 8 
of the 16 CPUs in the system. An updated 
Ryzen Master Utility lets you switch between 
Game Mode when it’s needed for older 
games, and Creator Mode when you want all 
of your CPU cores and more memory 
bandwidth.
Does it work? Yes. Although we won’t get 
into its impact on gaming until later, we did 
measure the modes’ impact on latency and 
memory bandwidth. 
However, Game Mode has the opposite 
effect on memory bandwidth. Because Game 
A Threadripper CPU is ready to be installed.

SEPTEMBER 2017   PCWorld   33
Mode enables NUMA/Local Mode, you give 
up a significant amount of memory bandwidth 
What’s right? Well, it’s complicated. Gears 
of War Ultimate, AMD says, likes low memory 
latency, so Game Mode should be on for that 
game. Rise of the Tomb Raider likes more 
CPU cores, so maybe you’ll want it off. Far Cry 
4 likes low core-to-core latency, so maybe 
you’ll want to switch on Game Mode.
If this all sounds way too complicated 
when you just want to play a game, know that 
for the most part this is just being nit-picky. 
Any modern game paired with a modern 
powerful GPU and a Threadripper CPU will 
run fine at normal resolutions and visual 
quality settings. AMD just wants gamers to 
have more granular control so they can wring 
more performance out of the new CPU. Some 
may be put off by this complexity, but if you’re 
really buying a 16-core, 32-thread CPU just for 
conventional gaming, you’re doing it wrong. 
A regular Ryzen or Kaby Lake CPU is probably 
better for that purpose.
HOW WE TESTED
None of this matters without solid 
performance. Our Threadripper 1950X was 
tested with an Asus ROG Zenith Extreme 
X399 motherboard, a ThermalTake Floe Riing 
(yes, that’s how it’s spelled) 360 cooler, 
The new Game Mode helps address legacy games that can’t handle the crazy core count and also 
switches to a NUMA memory mode.

Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080, Samsung 960 Pro 
SSD, and 32GB of DDR4/3200 RAM.
These last two items actually differ from our 
standard configuration, which is a HyperX 
Savage SATA SSD and 32GB of DDR4 at JEDEC 
2133 speeds. To minimize the impact of the 
SATA SSD versus a PCIe SSD, we used a HyperX 
Savage SSD as the target and source drive for 
any tests where storage might have an effect—
primarily our encoding test using Handbrake 
and Adobe Premiere Creative Cloud.
The memory configuration was a little 
stickier, as we’ve tested previous CPUs with all 
DIMM slots filled. On Ryzen, that limited the 
memory clock speeds, as only JEDEC speeds 
are allowed when fully loaded with RAM. That 
hurts Ryzen, particularly because Infinity 
Fabric is directly tied to the speed of the 
memory controller.
Getting the Core i9-7900X to run at 
DDR4/3200 was also problematic, as it 
effectively overclocks the CPU to 4.3GHz on 
all cores in our BIOS. So, instead, we ran the 
Core i9 system using the XMP default setting 
of DDR4/2666. 
This isn’t ideal, but as memory increasingly 
ties itself to a platform’s performance, we’ll have 
to continue to search for a happy medium.
APPLICATION 
PERFORMANCE
Pull up a chair, because everyone wants to 
see how Threadripper does on pretty much 
everything. We’re going to start with single-
application performance and some synthetic 
benchmarks, then move on to multitasking 
and gaming. 
BLENDER 
PERFORMANCE
Let’s kick this off where AMD 
started the Zen hype train 
almost exactly a year ago: 
Blender. This is an open-
source 3D modelling 
application that actually gets 
decent use in indie films for 
effects scenes. Heck, even 
NASA uses it (go.pcworld.
com/nui) for its models these 
days. Blender loves CPU 
threads, but we’ve found that 
it doesn’t always scale as well 
That’s no moon, that’s a Ryzen Threadripper below a Ryzen 7 and to 
the left of an LGA 2011 V3 Core i7 CPU.

as commercial products such as Maxon’s 
Cinema4D. Still, more cores generally means 
more performance, and the first win goes to 
Threadripper 1950X for handily rendering 
Mike Pan’s popular BMW benchmark file (go.
pcworld.com/bf) 22 percent faster than the 
10-core Core i9-7900X.
We know we just said Blender doesn’t 
always scale perfectly, but when you look at 
the score from the 8-core, 16-thread Ryzen 7 
1800X compared to the 16-core, 32-thread 
Threadripper 1950X, Threadripper takes just 
over half the time to render the image. 
POV-RAY PERFORMANCE
Our second test is also free: the Persistence of 
Vision Ray Tracer. This application dates all the 
way back to the Amiga but is 
continually updated and 
supported. It’s no surprise, but ray 
tracing is a CPU-intensive task, and 
throwing more CPUs at it makes it 
go faster.
Against the Core i9-7900X, the 
Threadripper 1950X is 35 percent 
faster running the internal 
performance benchmark. Against 
the 8-core Ryzen 7 1800X, you’re 
looking at an 85-percent 
performance boost. From a multi-
threading point of view, it’s all win 
here for the Threadripper 1950X.
Before you pop the champagne, 
when only a single thread is used 
this turns into a battle of overall clock speed 
and IPC, or micro-architecture efficiency. When 
it’s all about single-threaded clock speeds, it’s 
all about Intel’s 7th Gen Core i7-7700K, which 
jumps to the front. Skylake-X, with its very high 
Turbo Boost Max 3.0 cores, comes in second. 
Threadripper pulls in about 14 percent slower 
than the Core i9-7900X, which is within striking 
distance.
CINEBENCH R15 
PERFORMANCE
CineBench R15 benchmark is based on the 
same engine Maxon uses in its Cinema4D 
professional application. Like the previous 
two applications, it’s all about the thread 
count, so again Threadripper 1950X triumphs

the momentum again shifts back to Intel’s 
7th-gen Kaby Lake CPUs and Core X, though 
Skylake-X is still just 12 percent faster than 
Threadripper. Note, too, that Threadripper 
1950X manages to hang tight with Intel’s 
original consumer 10-core, the Core 
i7-6950X, which cost $1,723 when released.
CORONA RENDERER 
PERFORMANCE
One final rendering benchmark is the newish 
Corona Renderer test (go.
pcworld.com/crt). It’s a 
new plug-in renderer for 
Autodesk 3ds Max and is 
touted as being 
“unbiased” and high-
performance. As the test 
is new to us, our sample 
set is extremely limited. 
Given that AMD is 
promoting it, however, 
the results aren’t 
surprising: Corona 
Renderer loves CPU cores 
and gives the 
Threadripper 1950X a 
21-percent advantage.
GEEKBENCH 4 
PERFORMANCE
Geekbench is one the most popular free 
benchmarks around. We don’t typically use it 
to gauge performance of desktop CPUs. It’s 
recently been gaining some traction, 
however, as the latest version does away with 
many of the controversial aspects of the 
previous version.
The results put the Threadripper 1950X 
in front, but not by much, never mind its 
six-core advantage. Does this mean 
Threadripper 1950X isn’t as fast as the 
previous tests show? No. More than 
anything else, it probably shows that

like something about the Ryzen design, as 
the Ryzen 7 doesn’t do well either.
And no, this isn’t the older 4.04 version. 
The latest 4.1 version did add some updates 
for AMD’s micro-architecture, but apparently 
not enough. 
WINRAR PERFORMANCE
Speaking of applications that seem to have no 
love for Threadripper 1950X, here are the 
results of WinRAR 5.40’s internal benchmark. 
There’s no mixup: WinRAR just doesn’t 
perform very well on Threadripper.
WinRAR seems to be fair in that it 
doesn’t like Skylake-X much either, instead 
putting the two Broadwell-E chips clearly in 
front. Why? At the time of our Core i9 
review, Intel said its 
analysis showed that the 
new mesh design on Core 
i9 was the issue. The 
mesh design makes it 
easier and faster for Intel 
to connect multiple cores, 
but there is a penalty in 
WinRAR and some games 
as well. 
Intel’s mesh is similar to 
AMD’s Infinity Fabric in 
some ways, so it’s entirely 
possibly WinRAR is 
revealing an Achilles’ heel 
in both designs. 
7-ZIP PERFORMANCE
Fret not, AMD fans: The good news is you can 
just use 7-Zip, because it’s all roses there. 
Threadripper 1950X is again large and in 
charge with a 22-percent lead over its Core i9 
nemesis. Although 7-Zip doesn’t scale as well 
as the 3D tests, Threadripper’s still a healthy 
73 percent faster than the 8-core Ryzen 7 
1800X.
VERACRYPT PERFORMANCE
One other test that AMD has touted is 
VeraCrypt. Based on TrueCrypt, VeraCrypt 
picked up where its popular free predecessor 
fell apart. As it’s new to us, our sample set is 
tiny, but it shows a whopping 45-percent 
advantage for Threadripper.

AMD RYZEN THREADRIPPER
ADOBE 
PREMIERE  
CC 2017 
PERFORMANCE
Besides 3D rendering, 
video encoding is one of 
the top reasons people 
buy mega-core chips. To 
test that we take a short 
project that PCWorld’s 
video team shot on a 4K 
Sony Alpha camera and 
export it using the 1080p 
Blu-ray preset, with the 
maximum render quality 
option checked.
Both the target and the source of our test 
don’t actually reside on the PC’s local drive. 
Instead, we store it on a Plextor M8e PCIe 
SSD that’s moved from machine to machine 
for testing. This essentially makes the storage 
subsystem irrelevant in the performance 
discussion.
The first result uses CPU encoding rather 
than the CUDA engine on the GPU. Scoff all 
you want—many professionals still say CPU 
encoding gives you the best quality.  The 
results put the Threadripper 1950X in front with 
a score about 20 percent faster than the Core 
i9-7900X’s. Against the 8-core Ryzen 7 1800X, 
it’s 39 percent faster. Our encode times are 
relatively short given the video project’s short 
duration, but any professional who’d like to 
shave off 20 percent on a 5-hour encode will 
likely pay for it.
For those who use the GPU, we ran the 
same project using the GTX 1080 for the heavy 
lifting. Our encode times are drastically cut 
down using GPU rendering, but if you think the 
CPU doesn’t matter, think again. Compared to 
an 8-core CPU, for example, the Threadripper 
1950X is still 37 percent faster. 
HANDBRAKE 
PERFORMANCE
Our last encode test uses the free and popular 
Handbrake encoder to convert a 30GB file 
using the Android Tablet preset. Handbrake 
tends to love CPU cores and threads, but 
we’ve found the scaling starts to peter out as 
you approach crazy amounts of cores. In this 
test, the 16-core Threadripper 1950X is “only”

MULTITASKING 
PERFORMANCE
Before we move on to gaming performance, 
we wanted to present how well these CPUs 
do when tasked with running multiple, 
multithreaded workloads. For that we 
decided to run Blender and Cinebench 
simultaneously. Multitasking tests can be 
difficult to pin down. AMD recommends 
manually setting the affinity of each core to 
the various applications to increase the 
reliability of the results. Most people won’t do 
that, however, so we decided to see if we 
could obtain repeatable results just by 
clacking off one benchmark and then another.
We found by running Cinebench first, and 
then starting Blender and keeping it in the 
foreground, we could obtain easily 
repeatable results. The results here are the 
average of three runs each, but we could 
reproduce the results days later.
Threadripper 1950X, with 32 threads at its 
disposal, finished the Blender render about 
19 percent faster than the Core i9-7900X. In 
CineBench R15 it was 46 percent faster than 
the Core i9-7900X.  
GAMING PERFORMANCE
Do people really buy $1,000 mega-core 
CPUs exclusively to play games? Probably 
not, but how well each CPU performs in 
gaming benchmarks is still an important 
metric for many (like it or not).
3DMARK 
FIRESTRIKE 
PERFORMANCE
First up is the venerable 
3DMark FireStrike test. This is a 
bit old and mostly a GPU test, 
but the overall score factors in 
CPU performance too. The 
overall winner is the 10-core 
Core i7-6950X (there’s a reason 
it cost $1,723). A close second 
is the Threadripper 1950X in 
Creator Mode. We did flip the 
switch for Game Mode and 
performance dropped. Why?

AMD RYZEN THREADRIPPER
Remember, Game Mode tells Windows it has 
access to only eight cores, so 3DMark uses 
only eight of them.
Drilling down into the Physics test results, 
you can see the direct impact of Game Mode. 
With all cores used by Windows, 
Threadripper pulls out in front. With half of 
them off in the OS, it’s just slightly faster than 
an 8-core Ryzen 7 1800X.
This isn’t a knock on AMD’s Game Mode, 
but clearly, for games that really need more 
CPU cores, set it to Creation Mode instead.
TOMB RAIDER 
PERFORMANCE
Turns out Tomb Raider with a GTX 1080 at 
1080p and set to Ultimate really doesn’t care 
about the CPU—it’s purely a GPU test. Why 
would we say that? If you look at the results of 
the elderly FX-8370 CPU, which was a dog in 
every single test, it’s humming nearly as well 
as the $1,000 CPUs here. 
TOM CLANCY’S RAINBOW 
SIX SIEGE PERFORMANCE
Moving on to something newer, we used Tom 
Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege at 1920x1080 
resolution and the medium-quality setting to 
make it less about the GPU.
The Threadripper 1950X exhibits the 
familiar pattern we’ve seen in Ryzen-Core 
face-offs in the past: Intel has 10 percent or 
more better performance. Considering that in 
the past we’ve seen AMD’s defecit be 15 to 
20 percent in some games at low resolution, 
this isn’t bad. But can Game Mode make a 
difference?
Yes. With Game 
Mode activated, the 
gap between the 
top-performing Core 
i7-6950X and 
Threadripper closes 
to about 5 percent. 
That’s right on the 
heels of the Core 
i9-7900X, which 
likely takes a 
performance hit from 
its mesh 
interconnect.

RISE OF THE TOMB RAIDER 
PERFORMANCE
Just as in Rainbow Six, the Threadripper 1950X’s 
performance in Rise of the Tomb Raider is a bit 
underwhelming in Creation Mode, but flip on 
Game Mode and it’s a ball game. Well, at least 
it’s in the ball game and trying.
ASHES OF THE 
SINGULARITY: ESCALATION 
PERFORMANCE
Our last gaming test is Ashes of the 
Singularity: Escalation, which is the poster 
child for how to use a CPU in gaming. 
Unfortunately for AMD, it’s all about Intel 
here: The Core i9-7900X has a commanding 
lead over Threadripper 1950X. Game Mode 
helps inch the Threadripper 1950X closer, but 
Intel still wins by 12 percent.
Why? Some of it is pure clock speed 
differences. But we expected this to be 
closer, especially considering that the 
developer of Ashes was one of the first to 
optimize for Ryzen earlier this year. Granted, 
game optimization has not yet proven to be 
the cure-all AMD promised. In the grand 
scheme of things, this isn’t a big deal, but it’ll 
vex AMD fans.
CONCLUSION
In this short-attention-span world, you’re 
probably looking for the quick answer. 
Unfortunately, the real answer has three parts, 
since CPUs fulfill a variety of purposes.
The first is single-threaded or very lightly-
threaded use, such as most photo-editing 
applications. In that category, the more spry 
quad-cores outpace Threadripper 1950X, 
though its relatively high clock speeds keep it 
very much in contention.
The second is gaming, where we see the 
familiar deficit of previous Ryzen launches. 
AMD argues that in social gaming, such as 
streaming and recording while gaming, more 
cores are better—and we’d tend to agree. But 
in conventional gaming, Intel leads. The good 
news is that AMD’s new Game Mode can 
help close that gap to the point that it doesn’t 
even matter.
That brings us to 
the last category: 
multithreaded 
performance. In

tests), Threadripper 1950X outpaced all 
comers by significant margins. It simply 
destroys any 8-core CPU and makes you 
question how the 10-core Core i9-7900X 
can dare to be priced the same as the 
Threadripper 1950X.
This last point is very much the entire 
reason for Threadripper 1950X’s existence. 
Frankly, no one should buy a $1,000, 16-core 
CPU just to play conventional gaming or run 
lightly threaded applications. It’s the wrong 
tool for the job.
You buy a 16-core CPU for work. Real 
work. Real work means modelling, encoding, 
and doing five things simultaneously, because 
it’s work.
For that, Threadripper 1950X is an 
incredible breakthrough in performance and 
cost. Just four years ago, consumers paid 
$1,000 to get a 6-core CPU. Today, the same 
$1,000 (go.pcworld.com/6cpu) gets you 16 
cores. That’s something to be applauded 
loudly by anyone who cares about 
performance.

he web browser is by far the

Best web browsers of 2017:

choices including Google’s Chrome, 
Mozilla Firefox, and Opera.
Let’s take a look at the four major (and 
modern) browsers to see how they stack up 
in 2017. (If none of these internet browsers 
strike your fancy, head over to PCWorld’s 
roundup of 10 intriguing alternative 
browsers on page91.)
CHROME
The current people’s 
champion, Google 
Chrome tops the 
metrics charts of both 
StatCounter and 
NetMarketShare by a huge 
margin. Google’s browser has built a 
dedicated fan base thanks to its massive 
extensions library, and the fact that it just gets 
out of your way to put the focus on web 
content, not the browser’s trimmings.
Chrome isn’t quite as simplistic as it 
once was, but it’s still very easy to use. There 
isn’t much to Chrome except a huge URL 
bar—known as the OmniBar—plus a space 
for extensions, a bookmarking icon, tabs, 
and that’s it.
Yet Google still finds a way to hide all 
kinds of features inside the browser, 
including deep integration with Google’s 
services. This allows you to sync your 
bookmarks, passwords, open tabs, and more 
across devices. Chrome also has multi-
account support if you need it on a family 
machine, a built-in PDF viewer, built-in 
Google Translate functionality, a task 
manager, and the always handy Paste and go 
context menu item.
If there’s one complaint people have 
about Chrome it’s that the browser eats up 
available memory. Our browser testing in 
2015 (go.pcworld.com/bt) showed that 
Chrome was definitely a memory beast, but 
two years later it fared pretty well in our tests.
MOZILLA
For users who love 
extensibility but want 
greater privacy than a 
Google-made 
browser can provide, 
the open source Mozilla 
Firefox is your best bet. Firefox paved the 
way for other browsers to become 
extensible, and while Firefox’s add-on 
catalog is pretty good, it now pales in 
comparison to the Chrome Web Store. Like 
Google, Firefox has a sync feature.
Where Firefox has really shined in recent 
years is with the browser’s incognito mode 
(go.pcworld.com/bim). All browsers have a 
private mode that lets you browse without 
any of your activity being logged in your 
saved history. But most of the time these 
private modes still allow websites to track 
your activity for that specific session. Firefox 
does away with this by including an ad and 
tracker blocker when using incognito mode.

SEPTEMBER 2017   PCWorld   45
OPERA
Before Chrome, 
Opera was a popular 
choice among power 
users—a position 
former Opera CEO Jon 
Stephenson von 
Tetzchner is trying to take back with Vivaldi 
(go.pcworld.com/viv). Opera today is really 
one of the more under-rated browsers 
around. It’s based on the same core 
technologies as Chrome (the Blink rendering 
engine and the JavaScript V8 engine), which 
means it can run many Chrome extensions—
there’s even an extension for installing 
extensions from the Chrome Web Store.
Opera’s also got a few unusual features 
like Turbo, which saves on load times and 
bandwidth by compressing webpages on 
Opera’s servers. It’s also got a nice security 
feature called domain highlighting that hides 
most of the URL so that users can see easily 
and clearly if they’re on Google.com or 
google.com.scam.com—with scam.com 
being the actual website.
More recently, Opera introduced its own 
take on the social sidebar (go.pcworld.com/
mro) with one-click access to services such as 
WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and 
Telegram. Like Chrome and Firefox, Opera 
also has its own cross-device syncing feature.
MICROSOFT EDGE
Microsoft Edge is still a work in progress. 
You’ll see below that its 
performance is 
getting better, but 
that’s not all there is 
to the browser in 
2017. The Edge 
extensions library is tiny 
(go.pcworld.com/lit), its 
sync functionality is near nonexistent, and it 
doesn’t get updates nearly fast enough—
though that is expected to change with the 
Fall Creators Update (go.pcworld.com/fcu).
Despite its shortcomings, Edge has 
several helpful features that will appeal to 
some. Edge is deeply integrated with 
Windows 10’s inking capabilities, as well as 
with OneNote, making it easy to clip a 
webpage, annotate it, and save it to a 
notebook. Cortana is also a big part of Edge. 
You can use Microsoft’s digital assistant to 
quickly search for information, compare 
prices, or get a quick calculation.
Like Chrome, Edge has a casting feature. 
There’s also a nifty set-aside tabs feature to 
stash a collection of websites, the ability to 
read ebooks (great for tablets), and an MSN.
com-ish new-tab page.
BENCHMARKS
That’s enough of an overview for our four 
contestants, let’s get down to business. To 
see which browser is worthy of your 
bandwidth in 2017 we used a variety of 
testing tools. For judging JavaScript we used

JetStream, and the now 
unsupported Octane 2.0 and 
SunSpider 1.0.2 
benchmarking tools. Then we 
turned to WebXPRT 2015 and 
Speedometer to challenge our 
browsers under simulated 
web app workloads.
Finally, we took a look at 
CPU and RAM usage. Similar 
to what we did in 2015, we 
loaded a set of 20 websites in 
a single window in quick 
succession using either a 
batch file or the command line 
depending on the quirks of 
the browser in question. Once 
all tabs began loading, we 
waited 45 seconds, and then 
checked the CPU and RAM 
usage. The idea was to see the 
amount of system resources 
the browser would use during 
a heavy workload.
One difference from 2015 
is that Flash was turned off for 
each browser—benchmarks 
were done with and without 
the plugin in 2015. In recent 
years, most browser makers 
have de-emphasized Flash, enabling it as 
“click-to-play” (go.pcworld.com/ctpl) and 
blocking nonessential website elements (go.
pcworld.com/we) that use Flash. Since the 
web is moving to a Flash-free existence we 
decided to live the dream right now.

4GB RAM, and an Intel Core i3-7100U. Each 
browser was tested over a hard line internet 
connection.
EDGE MAKES BIG GAINS
Looking at both Jetstream and SunSpider, 
Edge won top marks by a wide margin. 
SunSpider has been deprecated for some 
time and is no longer supported, but the 
result was still surprising. For Octane 2.0, 
which is also no longer supported, Firefox 
and Opera vied for top spot, with Chrome the 
laggard by a wide margin. For this set of 
benchmark scores higher is 
better with the exception of 
SunSpider.
Moving on to the more 
modern Speedometer test, 
which quickly iterates through a 
bunch of HTML 5-based to-do 
lists, Chrome came out on top. 
Google’s Blink-based cousin 
Opera came in second, with 
Edge and Firefox way behind. 
The numbers were much closer 
for WebXPRT 2015, which uses 
a wide number of web apps, 
from photo collections to 
online note-taking to data sets. 
Edge came out on top there, 
while the others were closer 
together with only a few points 
separating the back three. 
Again, higher is better for these tests.
Finally, we come to the memory and CPU 
test. Slamming an average PC with 20 tabs of 
mostly media rich sites all at once is certainly 
going to chew up a good chunk of CPU and 
memory. These browsers did not disappoint 
in that respect.
Despite its reputation, however, Chrome 
was tops here, using less than 40 percent 
CPU power, followed by Edge. The results 
were similar for memory with Chrome using 
the least. Take those impressive Edge 
numbers with a healthy dose of skepticism, 
however, as during testing the PC froze, and

don’t tell the whole story. Based on that 
experience, power users with multiple tabs 
open in Edge would feel some serious pain 
trying to get work done.
As for Firefox, you may notice that the 
browser chewed up CPU usage, but was 
relatively low in memory usage. The reason 
for that, as Mozilla reminded us, is that Firefox 
alone is transitioning from one browser 
process to four. Whereas Chrome and Edge 
use multiple processes for each tab. The idea 
behind the latter is that individual tabs 
running on separate processes won’t take 
down the whole browser if they crash. That 
approach does use more memory, however. 
Mozilla is trying to find a middle ground. On 
the one hand, Firefox helps maintain overall 
PC performance under heavier workloads, 
but it’s not great if you want dozens of sites to 
load as quickly as possible. 
AND THE WINNER IS...
So who wins? Here’s the way we see it.
Once again, Edge gets honorable 
mention for making some serious gains in 
performance and earning some truly 
impressive scores. But when you factor in 
customizability and how Edge fared in the live 
site stress test, it still has some work to do—
like offering a wider extension library and the 
ability to sync across devices. 
As in our previous showdown, Chrome 
continues to capitalize on these strengths, 
and even improves in the performance 
department by addressing its past resource 
issues, making it, once again, our first choice.
Opera again earns second place since it 
performed relatively well in the live stress test, 
and can be set up to take advantage of nearly 
all the same conveniences Chrome can.
As for Firefox, it’s also a fine choice. 
Mozilla’s browser definitely gets the job done, 
it’s very customizable, and its open source 
roots puts the browser in a league of its own. 
Once again, Edge gets 
honorable mention for making 
some serious gains in 
performance and earning some 
truly impressive scores.

f there’s any gaming laptop as 
recognizable year to year as Razer’s 
Blade line, it’s probably Alienware’s. 
Following a redesign a few years back, 
the humbly named Alienware 17 has stayed 
pretty much the same ever since, at least on 
the outside.
And you know what that means: Time to 
hit the gym if you want to do anything with 
this laptop besides set it on a desk and forget 
about it.
THE BUILD: BIGFOOT
The Alienware 17 R4 (currently priced at 
$2,549 on Amazon; go.pcworld.com/az17) 
is still so big. Just staggeringly huge. With so

ALIENWARE 17 R4
so-called “desktop replacement” 
proportions, I keep expecting Alienware to 
do the same.
But no. Year after year, Alienware’s laptops 
remain gigantic—the better to disperse heat, 
and therefore utilize the full (or fuller) potential 
of all those expensive parts inside.
I get it. Really, I do. You’re paying for 
performance, you want that performance, 
and Alienware’s 17-inch laptop will give it to 
you. (More on that later.) But it’s damn near 
impossible to haul anywhere, so don’t buy 
this machine thinking you’ll use it like a 
laptop. Or put it on your lap at all, really.
During this review I had occasion to take 
the Alienware 17 out of the country, and here 
the absurdity of the situation really hit home. It 
didn’t even properly fit in the 17-inch laptop 
case I use for my Blade Pro day-to-day, so I just 
shoved the Alienware 17 in as best I could 
and prayed. And at just over 9.5 pounds, 
carrying it through the airport was a 
Herculean effort. I left it in my hotel for six 
days, and it was great for some late-night 
gaming, but phew. Never again.
Size aside, it’s quite a pretty machine. 
Alienware’s standard chrome-and-black color 
scheme is still one of my favorites—straddling 
the line between flashy and professional. 
Alienware also has an eye for the small details, 
from its understated type-logo underneath 
the display to the row of macro keys 
unobtrusively arrayed to the left of the 
keyboard.
And if you love RGB LEDs, Alienware’s the 
competition to beat on that front. The 
keyboard is only zone-lit, which is a shame, 
but there are also RGB LED light strips 
embedded in both sides of the laptop and in 
the lid, as well as underneath the trackpad. 
That last bit is weirdly useful—I like a backlit 
keyboard, so of course I’d appreciate a backlit 
trackpad. The better to guide 
your fingers with, right? 
Again, flashy, but in 
that vaguely high-tech 
way only Alienware really 
attempts.
The display presents a 
tough choice for enthusiasts: 
The Alienware 17 comes in 
both 1440p and 4K models, 
but the 1440p version also 
boasts a 120Hz refresh rate 
and integrated G-Sync. It’s 

SEPTEMBER 2017   PCWorld   51
also slightly brighter, at 400 nits to the 4K 
model’s 300 nits. Personally I’d go for speed 
over resolution, especially at 17 inches, but 
everyone has different preferences, I know.
In either case, you can also opt for 
integrated Tobii eye-tracking. I spent a bit of 
time with this during my review, and have also 
spent time with the stand-alone desktop 
version. It’s kind of novel navigating your 
desktop with your eyes, and I imagine even 
more useful for those with disabilities, but I 
don’t think it’s must-have technology for the 
average user. As for its use in gaming, there 
are a few high-profile titles like Deus Ex: 
Mankind Divided, but it’s far from pervasive.
My two biggest complaints pertain to the 
rear of the machine. Instead of a normal 
laptop setup—which is to say, hinge at the 
very back—the Alienware 17 instead has the 
hinge set in approximately 1.25 inches.
Now, there’s a reason for this: heat. The 
fans all vent through this section at the rear of 
the chassis, meaning it gets uncomfortably 
warm. Not something you’d want to touch, 
nor something you’d want venting right next 
to the keyboard.
It’s ugly, though. Compared to the 
space-age lid, Ventilation Row looks like it was 
slapped on as an aftermarket part. It’s also 
part and parcel with the Alienware 17’s size 
problems, as the laptop isn’t just the size of 
the 17-inch screen, but that plus this fat ol’ 
hinge-and-vent outcropping on the back.
It’s surprisingly loud, too. I thought 
placing the fans behind the screen might 
dampen the sound a bit—if so, it’s not by 
much. Even under a moderate load the 
Alienware 17 can get noisy, and under full 
load (like when gaming) it all but requires a 
headset or headphones. On a positive note, 
the fans are less high-pitched and whiny than 
I’ve experienced in thin laptops like the Blade 
Pro (go.pcworld.com/bpro), but you won’t 
appreciate the difference much when it’s 
drowning out your game.
Alienware 17 R4
PROS
• Worthy of the “desktop replacement” moniker
• Excellent performance even under full load
• Display comes in 1440p/120Hz and 4K variants
CONS
•  Tons of fan noise despite larger size
•  Extra-large hinge/vent area makes an enormous 
laptop even more so
•  Some of the lower-tier models make baffling 
choices (like only 8GB of RAM)
BOTTOM LINE
There are rough edges, from the keyboard’s zone 
backlight to loud fans to its enormous size, but the 
Alienware 17 R4 is still one of the few machines that 
can truly function as a semi-portable desktop 
experience.

ALIENWARE 17 R4
My other big complaint is that power (as 
well as the proprietary Amplifier port, HDMI 
out, and ethernet) plugs into the rear vent 
area, on the back of the laptop. Alienware is 
hardly alone in this, especially when it comes 
to these massive desktop-replacement 
devices, but wow it can be annoying to try to 
plug in your laptop when you can’t even see 
the port.
Speaking of which: The power adapter is 
also gigantic, adding another 2.5 pounds to 
your carry weight. Again, this isn’t an 
Alienware-specific issue, and is typical for a 
desktop replacement. It’s just one more 
contributing factor to the Alienware 17’s 
dubious portability. Hauling around the 
laptop is bad enough. Hauling around the 
laptop and the charger? Injurious.
It’s not optional, either. Like most gaming 
laptops, the Alienware 17’s excellent 
performance (I’ll get to that) comes at a cost: 
mediocre battery life. In our standard 
rundown test, wherein we loop a 4K video file 
until the battery dies, the Alienware 17 lasted 
3 hours and 8 minutes under load—not bad 
for a laptop of this size, but certainly not 
enough to last you through the day.
PERFORMANCE:  
BATTLE OF THE 1080S
It’s worth it, though. Oh goodness me, it’s 
worth it.
The performance gap between slim Blade 
Pro-style laptops and these behemoth 
desktop replacements has narrowed in recent 
years—and the competition will likely get 
even more fierce as Nvidia’s new Max-Q (go.
pcworld.com/mq) parts hit the mainstream. 
But there’s still nothing quite like a so-called 
“desktop replacement” for getting desktop-
quality performance.
The Alienware 17 we reviewed came 
equipped with an Intel Core i7-7820HK, an 
Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080, and 16GB of 
DDR4 RAM clocked at 2,400MHz, plus 
500GB of SSD storage and an additional 1TB 
of hard-drive space. We’ve seen some 
laptops more powerful than this one, but it’s 
up there.
(Note: One oddity is that the Alienware 
17’s baseline model comes with just a single 
8GB stick of RAM. Don’t do that to yourself. 
Opt for at least 16GB.)
That i7-7820HK is the 
Alienware 17’s strongest 

SEPTEMBER 2017   PCWorld   53
asset. Most laptops top out at the 
i7-7700HQ—a perfectly respectable 
processor in its own right. Indeed, the 
difference between 
the two is only 
100MHz, with the 
7700HQ clocked at 
2.8GHz (3.8GHz 
Turbo) and the 
7820HK at 2.9GHz 
(3.9GHz Turbo).
The advantage 
still goes to the 
7820HK, though, 
and you can see it 
clearly in our 
HandBrake test. We 
feed a 30GB file 
through HandBrake 
to see how long it 
takes for the system 
to render it down to 
an MP4, using the 
Android Tablet 
standard—a CPU-
intensive task. Our 
7820HK-toting 
Alienware 17? A little 
under 39 minutes. An 
Alienware 15 with a 
7700HQ? Almost 
46, for a difference of 
about 7 minutes. The 
same goes for other 
7700HQ laptops like the Gigabyte Aero 15 
(go.pcworld.com/ga15) and the Asus ROG 
Zephyrus GX501 (go.pcworld.com/gx5).

Then there’s the 
GTX 1080, a 
powerhouse in its 
own right. Here we 
see some interesting 
behavior vis-a-vis 
Nvidia’s crop of 
Max-Q laptops—and 
the performance 
advantage when you 
buy a full-size

like the Alienware 17.
See, in short 
benchmarks of the 
Max-Q laptops match 
or even outpace the 
Alienware 17. By 
“short” I mean pretty 
much any in-game 
benchmark, as these 
typically only run for a 
minute or two. 
Looking at Rise of the 
Tomb Raider, for 
instance, you’ll see 
that the Alienware 17 
ran at 102.2 frames per 
second, and Asus’s 
Max-Q 1080-sporting 
GX501 at 104.8.
The same matched-or-slightly-exceeded 
behavior is seen in Middle-earth: Shadow of 
Mordor, where the Alienware 17 posts 154.9 
fps versus the GX501’s 156.7 fps. Interesting, 
right? If Max-Q is that good, it seems like it 
would completely negate the need for an

oversized laptop like the Alienware 17.
But Max-Q works only in short bursts. 
Remember, the key advantage to a laptop like 
the Alienware 17 is heat management and 
venting—an aspect that doesn’t make much 
difference in the short term but makes a huge 
difference in the long(er) term.
Enter 3DMark, with its longer 
benchmarks. Here, you consistently see the 
Alienware 17 outpace its Max-Q competitor. 
In 3DMark’s latest TimeSpy benchmark, the 
Alienware 17 scored a 6,538 versus the 
GX501’s 5,489. The same gap exists in Fire 
Strike Ultra, where the Alienware 17 posted 
4,960 to the GX501’s 4,091.
In fact, the GX501 performs more like a 
1070 in these longer tests. The afore-
mentioned Alienware 15, which packs a 1070 
in addition to its i7-7700HQ, put up scores of 
5,386 and 4,097 in TimeSpy and Fire Strike 
Ultra, respectively. As my colleague Gordon 
Ung so succinctly put it: In Alienware’s 
machine, the 1080 gives you full 1080 
performance all the time.
I’m not here to throw Max-Q under the 
bus. On the contrary, I think a Max-Q laptop 
with its lighter-weight design is probably 
more practical for most people day-to-day. 
Pound for pound, Max-Q has the 
performance edge.
Alienware gives you desktop 
performance, though, and under greater 
duress. All that heat management 
adds pounds, but the Alienware 
17 vents like a pro, and the result is going to 
be better graphics, and a better and more 
consistent frame rate. Of course, you could 
do better if you opted for a desktop 
replacement with a desktop-class CPU, like 
the Origin EON17-X—but it’ll sure cost you.
BOTTOM LINE
There are rough edges. Zone backlighting is a 
bit outdated, the fans are loud, battery life is 
average, and the extra inch-plus of venting 
adds insult to injury in terms of the Alienware 
17’s size. I’d love to see Alienware branch out 
and bring its unique aesthetic to a thin, 
lightweight Max-Q laptop one of these days.
But the Alienware 17 plays to the com-
pany’s strengths: performance, performance, 
performance. This machine’s got it in spades, 
handily outpacing what we’ve seen of the 
new Max-Q crop so far and proving the 
importance of good thermals. It’s one hell of a 
desktop replacement.

Best cheap laptops:  
We rate the best-sellers on

Here’s what we’d tell our non-nerdy friends if they asked which laptops are really the 
best deals on Amazon and Best Buy. BY GORDON MAH UNG

SEPTEMBER 2017   PCWorld   57
So, in the spirit of offering you the same 
expert advice I’d give to my nearest and 
dearest, I’ve combed through the best-
selling budget laptop lists from both 
Amazon and Best Buy, and weighed the pros 
and cons. Both lists change quite rapidly, so 
I’m basing this on a snapshot in time—
namely, the best-selling laptops on the 
morning of July 21, 2017.
This year’s Amazon top five is dominated 
by Intel, with three out of five running its 
processors and the remaining two running 
AMD. At Best Buy, where people spend a 
little more, Intel dominated the top five even 
more decisively, with just a lone AMD entry.
Are these reviews? Absolutely not. But I 
still think there’s a lot of value in helping out 
those who can’t tell an Atom from a Core i7.
AMAZON’S TOP FIVE
1. Acer Aspire E 15
While last year’s buyers preferred a beefed up 
version of the Acer Aspire E 15 (which is No. 5 
this year), consumers have voted for lower 
cost with this year’s $349 Aspire (go.pcworld.
com/asp). This year’s top seller gives you a 
dual-core, 7th-generation Intel Core i3-7100; 
4GB of DDR4 RAM; a 1TB 5,400rpm hard 
drive; and a DVD burner. Other notable specs 
include the screen, which is pretty good for 
the price, with a 15.6-inch 1920x1080, or “full 
HD,” panel.
A Core i3 might not sound as impressive 
as a Core i5, but the actual performance 
difference to the average consumer will likely 
be negligible. The Core i5 boasts a 700MHz 
advantage, or roughly 30 percent. In practical 
terms, the Core i3 might exhibit a step or two 
slower performance, but for general 
computing use, the average person usually 
can’t tell the difference.
That’s because a system’s hard drive is 
usually the bottleneck to performance. And at 
this price, you’re almost always going to get a 
hard drive (No. 4 on this list being the 
exception). Relatively ancient hard-drive 
technology is about as slow and cumbersome 
as using a record player over an MP3. 
Fortunately, the Aspire E 15 is easy to service, 
so if you can afford to upgrade to a solid-state 
drive (SSD), do it.
Graphics performance, which mostly 
impacts gaming, is also sacrificed in this 
budget Aspire. Rather than a dedicated 
graphics chip in the laptop with its own 
memory pool, the Aspire E 15 uses Intel’s 
integrated HD 620 graphics. It results in 
nearly half the graphics performance of the 
beefier Aspire E 15 (No. 5 this year) but it’s 
really not a deal breaker. It will still handle 
most light-duty gaming such as Minecraft—
just don’t expect miracles.
One final thing to note is that of the 10 
laptops in this story, the Aspire E 15 is among 
the heaviest at 5.3 pounds. The only other 
laptop to weigh this much is the No. 5 Acer 
Aspire E 15. Still, overall this is a fine notebook 
and we give it a Thumbs Up, but we gotta say, 

58   PCWorld   SEPTEMBER 2017
REVIEWS
BEST CHEAP LAPTOPS
the No. 2 is also pretty appealing for budget 
shoppers on Amazon—this is the real fight.
2. HP Notebook 15
The theme here is cheap and HP’s Notebook 
15 (go.pcworld.com/hpn) pushes the price 
for a 15.6-inch laptop down to $252. Dayum. 
Costing $100 less than the Acer takes some 
effort, which meant passing over Intel’s pricier 
CPUs for an AMD A6-7310 quad-core chip. 
Although a quad-core may sound better than 
a dual-core, the underlying design matters 
too.
Performance data for the A6-7310 is 
limited, but it’s based on AMD’s Puma 
architecture. For the most part, the A6-7310 is 
sandwiched between the performance of an 
Intel Atom or “N” series Celeron and a Core 
i3. So, not bad, but not great.
And despite the Radeon R4 name, 
graphics performance of the APU looks to be 
about two-thirds of a comparable Intel GPU, 
based on reports. That means, for the most 
part, gaming will be limited to lower 
resolutions and lower game settings.
On the storage front, you get a 500GB 
5,400rpm hard drive, a DVD burner, and a 
screen resolution of 1366x768.
The upshot is that this a serviceable 
laptop, but one that will generally have lower 
performance and perhaps slightly less battery 
life than the Acer Aspire E 15.
At the same time, you save $100, which 
can go toward rent, or a couple of weeks’ 
worth of lunches.
3. Asus Chromebook  
C202SA-YS02
Asus’s Chromebook C202SA (go.pcworld.
com/ac1) is one of those laptops that reminds 
you why Chromebooks rule the budget-
laptop category (see our full review (go.
pcworld.com/frr) for details). Besides their 
popularity in education, Chromebooks just 
offer a lot of value.
The Chromebook C202SA, for instance, 
is intended for schools, which means its 
semi-ruggedized, or at least made to take 
more of a beating with its rubber-covered 
corners and “spill-proof” keyboard.
Inside the C202SA 
is an Intel Celeron 
N3060 CPU, which can 
be thought of as an Atom CPU 
on steroids. It’s the primary CPU running 

SEPTEMBER 2017   PCWorld   59
most Chromebooks today and is fine for most 
tasks. The C202SA has 4GB of RAM, which is 
preferable to the 2GB of RAM you typically 
see in low-end Chromebooks.
Storage is handled by 16GB of eMMC—
chip-based storage technology that’s similar 
to an SSD but slower. As slow as eMMC can 
be, it’s still way better than a hard disk drive 
and a key reason for budget Chromebooks’ 
responsiveness.
If you’re new to Chromebooks and worry 
about 16GB vs. 32GB or more, don’t be. 
ChromeOS is a very lightweight OS with 
deep ties to the cloud. It’s why you can have a 
16GB Chromebook and use it for years 
without running out of space.
The only real negative of the C202SA is its 
bulk, but if the user is a child (or klutz), the 
trade-off for semi-rugged features may well 
be worth it.
In the end, this one is easy: thumbs up.
4. HP 14-inch Laptop
The No. 4 seller on Amazon, HP’s 14-inch 
Laptop (go.pcworld.com/hp14), is a 
complicated laptop story. The first thing 
that grabs you is the price: It’s a Windows 
10 Home laptop for $219. The second 
thing is the screen: It’s a higher-
resolution 1920x1080 panel that makes 
the 1366x768 screens you get in this 
price range seem janky. Even better, it 
uses superior IPS technology. IPS 
gives you excellent off-axis viewing, 
and rarely, if ever, provides a bad 
experience, whereas so-called “IPS-like” or 
“wide-viewing angle” panels run the gamut 
from bad to good.
Even the AMD E2-7110 CPU isn’t half bad. 
Like the AMD A6-7310, it’s slower than Core 
i3, but generally slightly faster than a Celeron 
“N” CPU. So what’s the catch? Storage. HP 
outfits the creatively named 14-inch Laptop 
with a 32GB eMMC drive. While eMMC can 
yield a more responsive feel than a hard drive, 
the limited space is problematic on a 
Windows-based laptop.
This laptop will basically give you a great 
screen to look at and reasonable 
responsiveness from its eMMC drive, but the 
minute you fill up the drive (which won’t take 
long), the experience is going to take a dive.

It’s really a shame, because with just a little 
more storage space or a hard drive option 
(along with the eMMC), this could be an 
incredible bargain laptop. As it is, you need 
to really consider this laptop’s limitations 
before you buy one. Our verdict: thumbs 
down.
5. Acer Aspire E 15
Take last year’s best-selling Acer Aspire E 15 
(go.pcworld.com/aa15), update the CPU, 
add a USB Type C port, and you pretty much 
have the No. 5 Amazon laptop.
Yes, it looks the same as the No. 1 selling 
Acer Aspire E 15 above, but there’s a world of 
difference here. The main one is the graphics. 
With a GeForce 940MX, you’re getting 
reasonable graphics performance from a 
budget laptop. The second difference is 
storage. This particular Acer Aspire E 15 
dumps the hard drive for a 256GB M.2 SSD. 
That means this laptop will likely feel and act a 
lot more responsive than dog-slow hard disk 
drive-based laptops in most use cases. 
Although we haven’t confirmed it, Amazon 
customers have reported that a hard drive 
upgrade is a snap on this model.
Acer also doubles the RAM from the base 
model to 8GB. The CPU is Intel’s latest 
7th-generation Core i5-7200U, which is the 

SEPTEMBER 2017   PCWorld   61
same chip used in laptops that cost twice as 
much as the Aspire E 15.
If there were two things to ding about this 
laptop, it would be the weight and the price. 
At 5.3 pounds, it’s not as light as the 
competition. And at $579, it stretches the 
definition of budget laptop.
Still, if you want snappier 
performance at a good price and 
don’t care about the weight, the 
Acer Aspire E 15 is a thumbs up.
BEST BUY’S TOP FIVE
At Best Buy, the list of best-selling 
laptops offers a far more 
interesting mix. It runs the gamut 
from Apple to AMD, pits an 
Intel Celeron CPU against 
a Core i3, and extends 
beyond the “budget” realm. It’s enough to 
leave less-tech-savvy folk confused as hell.
Fortunately, though, I can help.
1. Lenovo IdeaPad 110
Lenovo’s IdeaPad 110 (go.pcworld.com/
ip110s) is more or less the equal of the HP 
Notebook 15 that’s the No. 2 best seller 
on Amazon. It has the same CPU, an 
AMD A6-7310; the same 
amount of RAM, 4GB; 
and the same size hard 
drive, 500GB. With the same 
size and same resolution panel, the main 
difference is the price.
On the date we locked this down, this 
laptop was going for an amazing $199. That’s 
a steal. When it isn’t on sale though, it’s 
typically $279, which makes it a little less 
palatable.
Sure, among the top five at Best Buy, it’s 

62   PCWorld   SEPTEMBER 2017
REVIEWS
BEST CHEAP LAPTOPS
the cheapest of the Windows laptops, but 
$279 is pretty close to Amazon’s top seller, 
the Acer Aspire E 15, which gives you a 
higher-resolution screen, and slightly more 
performance. So when not on sale, we’d say 
the IdeaPad 110 is a wobbler for us.
When on sale for $199, however, it’s an 
impressive amount of hardware for the price 
and an easy thumbs up.
2. Apple MacBook Air 13
Apple has a reputation for overcharging for 
its hardware and that rep is normally well 
deserved. The MacBook Air 13 (go.pcworld.
com/mba13) you see here though (and at 
the price we stumbled upon) is almost 
reasonably priced.
Inside you get an Intel 5th-generation, 
dual-core Core i5-5250U, 8GB of LPDDR3 
RAM, and a 128GB PCIe SSD. The 
construction of the laptop is top-notch, too, 
with an aluminum shell and outstanding 
trackpad and keyboard. For the most part, 
this is a slightly sped-up version of the 
MacBook Air 13 that Apple first introduced 
in 2015.
Overall, the MacBook Air 13 yields zippy 
performance for general computing, with 
only heavier chores such as gaming and 
photo-editing being issues. Battery life is also 
legendary thanks to a giant battery and a 
compromised screen. The screen, in fact, is 
probably the main negative of the hardware 
(well, that and the fact that you’re buying 
hardware introduced two years ago).
Even though it’s only 13 inches diagonally, 
the display is an unimpressive 1440x900 in 
resolution using TN technology. Although TN 

SEPTEMBER 2017   PCWorld   63
is unsuitable for critical photo-editing (IPS 
panels are preferred for that), the one Apple 
uses isn’t that bad.
The important factor is the price, though. 
Last year Apple was hawking this same basic 
laptop for $1,000, but on the day we froze 
our pricing, it was on sale for $699, which 
actually makes it a competitive laptop.
If you’re looking at Apple’s full asking 
price of $1,000, we’d point you to Dell’s 
XPS 13 or HP’s Spectre X360 13T, or 
No. 5 on this list as much better 
value. But for $699, the 
MacBook Air 13 earns a thumbs up.
3. Samsung Chromebook 3 
While Samsung’s Chromebook 3 (go.
pcworld.com/sc3) isn’t as rugged as the 
Asus Chromebook C202 on Amazon’s list, it 
can be had for 25 percent less. Internally, it’s 
basically the same and should yield the same 
performance with its Intel Celeron N3060 
and 4GB of RAM. The Samsung even gives 
you twice the amount of storage with its 
32GB of eMMC, although that’s a minor win 
since you really don’t need local storage on a 
Chromebook.
Performance of both the Samsung and 
Asus Chromebooks is fine and more than 
enough for basic browsing tasks. The 4GB of 
RAM helps out those who like to have a ton of 
pages open, as well. We generally prefer 
Intel’s Celeron N series (basically Atom) over 
the ARM chips we’ve seen in many 
Chromebooks.
The Chromebook 3’s screen is “just” 
1366x768, but at only 11.6-inches diagonal, 
you won’t notice its low resolution that much.
If you’re picking between the 
Chromebook 3 and the Asus C202, it mostly 
comes down to aesthetics and features like a 
spill-proof keyboard (Asus). The Samsung 
Chromebook 3 is a little thinner but, 
interestingly, slightly heavier.
Either way, this is a decent Chromebook 
that gives you more than a typical budget 
Chromebook from just a year ago. Thumbs up.
4. HP 15.6-inch Laptop
HP’s 15.6-inch Laptop (go.pcworld.com/
hp156) (if you ignore its boring name) is 
actually quite a decent laptop when on 
sale, but when it isn’t, it’s punching out of

REVIEWS
BEST CHEAP LAPTOPS
its weight.
The 15.6-inch HP gives you a Core 
i5-7200U, 8GB of RAM, and 2TB of storage. 
The Core i5 is indeed faster than a Core i3, 
but it’s still just a dual-core CPU and most 
people just won’t notice the difference in 
common browsing and Office chores.
The screen is a bit subpar with its 
1366x768 pixels stretched out over a 
15.6-inch expanse but it’s not a deal breaker. 
In fact, this is a decent performance laptop at 
the price we found on Best Buy ($449).
It’s main problem is when it’s not on sale. 
The non-sale price is $549, which puts it 
squarely in the territory of the No. 5 best seller 
on Amazon: Acer’s Aspire E 15. For $29 
more, the Acer gives you a GeForce 940MX 
graphics card, a higher-resolution 1920x1080 
screen, and a 256GB SSD.
So consider this laptop a thumbs up on 
sale, and a wobbler when not.
5. Lenovo Yoga 720
Like the No. 2 on the Best Buy best-selling list, 
the MacBook Air 13, Lenovo’s Yoga 720 (go.
The Yoga 720 also gives you the 
latest Thunderbolt 3 over USB-C

which uses the now-dying 
Thunderbolt 2 standard.

SEPTEMBER 2017   PCWorld   65
pcworld.com/ly720) is hardly a budget 
laptop at $759 on sale, but it also shows you 
just how much more value there is in PCs.
Unlike the MacBook Air 13 that still rolls 
a 5th-gen CPU, the Yoga 720 features 
Intel’s latest 7th-gen dual-core Core 
i7-7500U. You also get 8GB of RAM (the 
same as the MacBook Air 13) and twice the 
amount of storage at 256GB using an 
ultra-fast SSD. In practical, everyday use, 
performance between the Yoga 720 and 
MacBook Air 13 won’t be noticeably 
different, but in more difficult tasks, the 
Yoga 720 will be faster.
The Yoga 720 also gives you the latest 
Thunderbolt 3 over USB-C unlike the 
MacBook Air 13, which uses the now-dying 
Thunderbolt 2 standard.
The screen on the Yoga 720 is higher 
resolution at 1920x1080 and features IPS 
technology, which is preferable to the TN 
technology in the MacBook Air 13.
The Yoga 720 also folds backward for use 
as a tablet and features 10-point touch and 
pen support. That’s just way more versatility 
than the MacBook Air 13 offers.
If the MacBook Air 13 were priced at its 
typical $1,000, there would be no 
comparison between the two in 
performance, storage, and versatility. The 
only time it gets close between the Yoga 
720 and the MacBook Air 13 is when you 
can find the MacBook Air 13 on sale at $749, 
and the Yoga 720 is off sale at $849. Even 
then, you’re still getting double the storage, 
Thundebolt 3, a touchscreen, pen support, 
and a higher-resolution IPS panel for just 
$100 more.
The Yoga 720 is a thumbs up, on sale or 
not.

ntil WD’s My Passport SSD 
showed up on our doorstep, 
Samsung’s T3 (go.pcworld.
com/st3) USB 3.1 (Gen 1, 
5Gbps) portable SSD was the last word in 
super-svelte, high-capacity storage. Now 
there’s at least a conversation. The My 
Passport SSD even adds a little spice to the 
debate by using a Type C USB 3.1 
(10Gbps) interface. The extra bandwidth 
made no difference in performance, and 
the T3 is still a little faster. More on the why 
of that later.
PRICE AND DESIGN
Small and fast costs more. At the time of this 
writing, the My Passport SSD was available 
only from Best Buy, with the 256GB version 
costing $100, the 512GB version priced at 
$200, and the 1TB version we tested going 
for an even $400. That’s not cheap, but 
roughly on par with the T3.   
WD My Passport SSD: Worthy 
competition for Samsung’s T3
WD’s USB 3.1 Gen 2 SSD vies with Samsung for the top spot in small, fast, and spacious 
portable storage. BY JON L. JACOBI

SEPTEMBER 2017   PCWorld   67
The My Passport SSD is roughly 3.5 
inches long, 1.75 inches wide, and a mere 
0.4 inch thin. We 
can’t think of 
anything offhand 
that’s of a similar size, 
though an oversized 
lighter comes to 
mind. The important 
bit is that it fits handily 
in the palm of your 
hand, and readily into 
all but the smallest of 
pockets.
The drive weighs 
only a few ounces, 
and the two-tone, 
half-beveled design 
looks quite nice. A 
bit gaudier than the 
Samsung T3, but perhaps more interesting. 
The drive uses a USB Type C port, but 
comes with a C-to-A adapter for use with 
older systems.
Note that while WD, unlike Samsung, 
bundles some pretty fair backup software, we 
don’t recommend external SSDs for backup. 
That’s because all of the high-capacity USB 
SSDs we’ve used will occasionally, and 
seemingly arbitrarily, decide they no longer 
contain data. Recreate the partition and 
re-format, and they’re good to go, but the 
data is gone. We’ve experienced this type of 
failure with both the Samsung T1 and T3, as 
well as the Sandisk Extreme 900, with no 
discernible reason as to why.

PERFORMANCE
The 1TB My Passport SSD 
is a bit faster than the 
Samsung T3 according to 
CrystalDiskMark, as 
shown overleaf. However, 
both our 20GB copy tests 
and the AS SSD 
benchmark mildly 
disagree.
In our 20GB files and 
folder tests (see the chart 
below), the WD My 
Passport SSD lags 
significantly behind the 
Samsung T3, especially 
when reading. The 
Sandisk Extreme 900 
included in the 
comparison uses two M.2 SATA SSDs in RAID 
0 to boost performance.
In the AS SSD test, the WD My Passport 
SSD reads a bit faster, but writes 
considerably slower than the Samsung 
T3. The Kingston HyperX Savage is a 
top-notch internal SSD that we 
included in the chart to show 
the relative performance 
of SATA 6Gbps and 
USB 3.1.

WD has done a very nice job with the My

But it’s slower than the T3 with small files, 
so all things being equal—and yes, we’re 
talking price—the T3 is the better buy. Not 
that you’ll be disappointed with either. 
Both are so much faster than a hard drive, 
you’ll swear off spinning platters forever. 
Oh, wait...except for backup. And capacity.

Release date: Out now
Yes, if we’re going to draw the line in 2017 to 
indicate when “the big fall game releases 
start,” it would fall on August 8—the day Cliff 
Bleszinski and the team at Boss Key released 
sci-fi shooter LawBreakers (go.pcworld.com/
lb1; $30 on Amazon, go.pcworld.com/lba2).
Featuring high-speed movement in the 
vein of classic ‘90s shooters, LawBreakers 
focuses on verticality. Maps are dotted with 
low-gravity areas where you’ll go flying 
through the air, ambushing people from 
above, on maps inspired by Santa Monica, 
CA, and other real-world locales. I can’t say 
I’m a fan of the “edgy” voice acting, but the 
recent beta played great and a well-

Moves are governed by a

fighting style. It’s incredibly intimidating.
It’s incredibly powerful too. Once you get 
the hang of it you realize there’s a world of 
potential, as you experiment with what

XCOM 2: WAR OF THE

Release date: August 29
Things were so quiet after XCOM 2’s (go.

think Firaxis had moved on to other projects. 
Not so! Like XCOM: Enemy Within, XCOM 2 
($60 on Amazon, go.pcworld.com/xca) is 
getting a meaty expansion that overhauls 
basically the entire game, with new factions, 
new unit types, new boss enemies, more 
persistent campaign elements, and the 
ability to finally use alien soldiers in your 
army. It’s an ambitious undertaking for one of 
the 10 best PC games of 2016 (go.pcworld.
com/10b).
Personally, I’m looking forward to it as an 
excuse to return to XCOM 2, since the game’s 
launch issues meant I never really sank my 
teeth into it the way I did with its predecessor. 
So far, War of the Chosen ($40 on Amazon, 
go.pcworld.com/wotc) sounds like a pretty 
great excuse—and it better be, because at 
$40 this is priced less like an expansion and 
more like an entirely new game.

Dishonored 2 proper. Playing as Billie Lurk, 
you’ll team up with Dishonored antagonist 
Daud to…well, it’s pretty self-explanatory: Kill

TOTAL WAR:  
WARHAMMER II

I was surprised by Total War: Warhammer. I’ve 
been a fan of the historical Total War games 
for a long time now, but Warhammer seemed 
like a pretty strange tangent, and not 
necessarily one that would appeal to me.
Spoiler: It’s one of the best 
Total War games in years (go.
pcworld.com/btw1)—
certainly since Shogun 2. The 
freedom of divorcing from 
history gave Creative 
Assembly the leeway to 
experiment with all kinds of 
crazy units, new army 
compositions, unique faction 
restrictions, a loose campaign 
structure, and 
imaginative win 
conditions that just don’t 
fit into the historical Total 
War mold.
The upcoming 
“sequel,” Total War: 
Warhammer II (go.
pcworld.com/tww, $60 
on Amazon) is more of a 
stand-alone expansion, 
adding four new races 
(Lizardmen, High Elves, 
Dark Elves, and a fourth yet to be announced) 
and a new map. And if you own both the 
original and the sequel, you can combine 
them into one enormous cross-game 
campaign. Pretty wild—and there’s still one 
more game to come in this planned trilogy.

I can’t really fault the developers. It sounds 
like Cuphead went through a huge overhaul 
halfway through development, moving from a 
boss-rush type game to a full-fledged 
platformer. Hopefully it survived the pivot 
intact and plays as good as it looks.
MIDDLE EARTH:  
SHADOW OF WAR
Release date: October 10
I keep using this dumb Middle Earth: Shadow 
of More-dor joke to describe upcoming 
sequel Shadow of War (go.pcworld.com/
sow; $60 on Amazon, go.pcworld.com/
sowa), but it’s not without merit—this is 
definitely a case of “Don’t mess with a 
winning formula.” Monolith has taken the 
Nemesis System and the open-world Mordor 
of the first game and expanded it in a million 
directions (go.pcworld.com/emd), but 
moment-to-moment it’s still…pretty much the 
same game as before. Which is to say, Lord of 
the Rings crossed with Assassin’s Creed.
The Nemesis System is still great though, 
giving you army after army of unique orcs to 
fight against, as well as customized 
strongholds that reflect their personalities. 
And for the lore buffs? It seems like Monolith’s

taking many more liberties (go.pcworld.com/

time around—namely, Shelob can shed her 
spider skin and turn into a pale-skinned 
woman. Whether those changes are a good 
thing or not? Well, we’ll have to wait until 
October to find out.
SOUTH PARK: THE 
FRACTURED BUT 
WHOLE 
Release date: October 17
South Park: The Fractured But 
Whole (go.pcworld.com/sp2; 
$60 on Amazon, go.pcworld.
com/spa) joins the same 
ignominious club as Cuphead, 
victim to delay after delay. Get 
this: We were originally 
supposed to see The 
Fractured But Whole last 
December. Now, 
nearly a year later, 
we’re closing in 
on its latest 
release date.
Hopefully the 
delay was worth 
the wait. It’s been 
a while (almost a 
year) since I put in 
any hands-on 
time with The 
Fractured But 
Whole, but what past-me played was 
excellent—a more varied, more complex 
version of its already-solid predecessor Stick 
of Truth (go.pcworld.com/sot), but with 
superheroes instead of swords and sorcery.
Best case scenario: Ubisoft delayed 
almost a year to pump out Nosulus Rifts (go.
pcworld.com/nr) for everyone. We can 
only hope.

DESTINY 2 
Release date: October 24
After playing a bit of Destiny 2 (go.pcworld.
com/d22; $60 on Amazon, go.pcworld.
com/d2a) during E3, I called it “one of the 
prettiest PC games ever.” I know—I was 
surprised too. After all, this is Bungie, a studio 
that hasn’t actually released a game on PC 
since Halo 2.
It’s brilliant looking though, especially 
running at 4K. And it plays surprisingly well. I 
wasn’t sure what to expect, given how 
console-oriented the original Destiny was, but 
guns feel powerful, kills feel snappy, and there’s 
a momentum to its action that I really enjoyed. 
This is how you blend a shooter and an RPG—
not The Division (go.pcworld.com/td2).
Unfortunately the PC version of Destiny 2 
releases about a month after the consoles, so 
you’ll have to be a bit more patient if you want 
to hold out for the prettiest version. You’ll get 
to test it out first though—there’s a beta 
scheduled for August 29. Keep an eye out.
ASSASSIN’S CREED ORIGINS 
Release date: October 27
Okay, I’ll say it: I expected Assassin’s Creed 
Origins (go.pcworld.com/aco1; $60 on 
Amazon, go.pcworld.com/acoa) to be a lot 
more imaginative for 2017. After taking a year 
off from the grind and reworking Assassin’s 
Creed from the ground up, I expected…well, 
something. Instead, what I played at E3 (go.
pcworld.com/ae3) feels quite a lot like old 
Assassin’s Creed, but in a different era and 
with a larger map.

SEPTEMBER 2017   PCWorld   79
Maybe that’s enough, though. Ptolemaic 
Egypt is at least an interesting setting, and a 
reworked combat system at least promises to 
be interesting for people who prefer to fight 
their way through Assassin’s Creed games 
instead of proceeding stealthily. And hey—
maybe there are more surprises we haven’t 
heard about yet. Here’s hoping.
WOLFENSTEIN II:  
THE NEW COLOSSUS 
Release date: October 27
If Divinity II isn’t my most 
anticipated (or, heaven forbid, 
it turns out to be terrible) then 
Wolfenstein II: The New 
Colossus (go.pcworld.com/
wnc, $60 on Amazon, 
go.pcworld.com/wnca) takes 
the award. Its 2014 
predecessor, Wolfenstein: The 
New Order ($20 on Amazon, 
go.pcworld.com/wno), is one 
of my favorite shooters (go.pcworld.com/fs3) 
of the past decade and pretty high on the list 
of my favorite games, period—a near-perfect 
blend of dumb ‘90s-style shooting with 
Escape From Butcher Bay-esque stealth 
sequences. And that blend makes perfect 
sense once you find out that a lot of Butcher 
Bay alums worked on this new-era 
Wolfenstein.
Wolfenstein II seems like it might recapture 
the same magic, bringing the Nazi threat to a 
conquered America, continuing with its

alt-history into the 1970s, and with an 
opening level that features longtime 
protagonist B.J. Blazkowicz slaughtering 
Nazis in a wheelchair (go.pcworld.com/snw). 
Get this: Every time you fire your weapon, the 
recoil pushes your wheelchair back.
Those small details and creative scenarios 
are what I love about Wolfenstein, and while I 
generally try to avoid hype I’m finding it 
difficult to be blasé about The New Colossus.
CALL OF DUTY: WWII 
Release date: November 3
Back to World War II. After running the 
modern warfare setting into the ground, then 
churning out a few years of bad-to-decent 
science fiction stories, Call of Duty is finally 
returning to the setting that started it all in Call 
of Duty: WWII (go.pcworld.com/codw, $60 
on Amazon, go.pcworld.com/codwa).
And you know what? I can’t wait. I’m 
unabashedly excited. Yes, it’s still Call of 
Duty. Yes, we’re probably in for a theme park 
version of World War II, hitting the same old 
Normandy-centric sights we’ve seen in 
World War II games since the Medal of 
Honor days.
But it’s been almost a decade since we 
had a big-budget World War II game. Played 
any 2007 games lately? Technology’s 
changed a lot in the ensuing years, and I

STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT II 
Release date: November 17
Will Star Wars Battlefront II (go.pcworld.com/

saw of it at E3 indicates at least one truth: This 
is the game DICE should’ve made (go.
pcworld.com/dic) two years ago. Forget the 
last half-finished Star Wars Battlefront (go.

script penned by Spec Ops: The Line writer 
Walt Williams and a vastly expanded scope, 
Battlefront II looks like it could finally win

confusing) and give EA a much-needed 
win for the year.

4 REASONS 
WHY I 
SWITCHED 
FROM 
GOOGLE 
TO BING
Whether you choose to switch 
search engines as a protest or 
just because you like Amazon gift 
cards, it’s easy to do.
By Mark Hachman

SWITCHING FROM GOOGLE TO BING
FEATURE
Maybe you’re considering doing the same, 
either over ire about the recent diversity- 
memo controversy, or some other aspect of 
the search giant that has rubbed you the 
wrong way. Here are some points to consider.
The move away from Google wasn’t easy. 
Sometime in the late 1990s, I was invited to 
test out Google’s search engine. I moved from 
poring though filing cabinets to typing queries 
in a search box. If it was out there on the web, 
Google promised that it would find it. 
Over the years, Google became smarter 
and more responsive. Google Instant 
auto-suggested search results before I fin-
ished typing them. “Google it” became part 
of my vernacular.
Meanwhile, Microsoft’s Bing search engine 
was getting no respect. Bing it? Please.
But Bing doggedly continued to improve. 
It added social connections and “cards” 
identifying key topics and related searches. It 
improved speed and reliability. Then one day, 
when I wanted to dig up older stories I had 
written using Google’s search engine, I found I 
had better luck finding them using Bing.
So I switched. 
Switching from Google to Bing is easily 
done in just a few seconds. I provide instructions 
at the end of this story (go.pcworld.com/inst). 
But before that, here are some of my favorite 
(even bizarre) reasons to switch to Bing.
Number one? Microsoft will pay you.
Just some of the things 
you can redeem your 
Microsoft Rewards 
search points on.
T
hree years ago, I switched from Google search to Bing. 
There, I said it. No longer do I Google something; I Bing it. 
And I haven’t looked back since.

1. SEARCH AND 
MAKE MONEY 
WITH 
MICROSOFT 
REWARDS
I’m cheap. I’ll generally 
pass up a $12 artisanal 
beef slider at the food 
trucks near my office in 
favor of a less expensive 
salad that could stuff a 
throw pillow. I often wear 
the same pants two days 
in a row to save on my 
water bill. I use coupons.
So if Microsoft wants 
to pay me about $5 a 
month to do what I 
normally do? Sign me up.
The concept behind 
Microsoft Rewards (go.pcworld.com/mr, 
formerly Bing Rewards) is simple: As you 
search, Microsoft gives you points.
If you have a Microsoft account (it’s free to 
sign up) you can earn five points per Bing 
search on a desktop PC, up to 150 points per 
day. In the same way, you can earn up to 100 
points per day on mobile, with five points 
credited to you per search. (These numbers 
may not match up to what you see, as Micro-
soft tends to vary the values every so often.) 
Bing searches are automatically triggered via 
Cortana on a Windows Phone, or the Bing 
Search app for Android or iOS. 
If that isn’t enough, you’ll automatically 
accumulate points by using the Windows 10 
Edge browser, up to 900 points per month. 
And if that isn’t enough, you’ll get a point for 
every dollar you spend on the Microsoft 
Windows and Xbox online stores, or in a 
brick-and-mortar Microsoft Store location. 
The best part? The points can be 
redeemed for things you’ll actually use.
For roughly 475 credits (the value varies) 
Microsoft will give you $5 to spend at Amazon, 
Target, Burger King, Starbucks, or other mer-
chants. You can also redeem your rewards (go.
pcworld.com/ryr) for a 5% coupon at the 
If you want even more points, take five minutes out of your day to check 
out the rewards and quizzes Microsoft Rewards offers.

FEATURE
Microsoft Store, discounts on Windows apps, 
or even a free month of Xbox Live Gold. Use 
Bing frequently enough, and you may reach 
Silver or Gold status, which confers a “dis-
count” on points redemptions.
All this for just using Bing during your day. 
For even more points, you can visit Bing.com 
or click the Microsoft Rewards medallion icon 
for quick quizzes and suggested searches. It 
all adds up quickly.
2. SEARCH RESULTS: AS 
GOOD OR BETTER THAN 
GOOGLE’S
I wouldn’t even mention Bing Rewards if Bing 
itself wasn’t worthwhile. But it is. My personal 
belief is that Bing delivers slightly more useful 
information than Google in general search. (To 
be fair, I’ll emphasize general: Sometimes I’ll 
try a search in Google if I can’t find what I’m 
looking for in Bing. As of August 2017, I’d say 
Bing’s ability to find an old news story of mine is 
slightly worse than it used to be, though it’s still 
very good.)
And don’t worry: Using Bing doesn’t 
prevent you from using other Google ser-
vices, like Gmail, as often as you’d like.
If I search for a term like Notre Dame 
football, Bing makes better use of that vast, 
white space on the right side, displaying 
Context is key, and Microsoft has made this a priority with Bing.

SEPTEMBER 2017   PCWorld   87
contextual information about the school, its 
history, news, and more. (Both engines show 
me the recent scores, but Google’s card 
displays a more complete upcoming schedule.)
Bing’s lead widens when you search for 
celebrities, as it includes videos as well as 
images and biographical information. And 
though Microsoft could do a better job of 
highlighting this information, Bing provides 
one-click links to a 
celeb’s social media 
pages for what 
they’re thinking 
about, right now.
There are excep-
tions, of course. But, in 
general, Bing performs 
as well as Google on 
most of my common, 
day-to-day searches.
3. BING HAS IMAGE CHOPS
That goes for image searches, too. Bing was 
first to implement the “infinite scroll” in Bing 
Images, where users could simply scroll and 
scroll and never reach the “end” of their search 
results. Today, Bing’s image search adds an 
extra layer of search filters that Google users 
must drill down to find, including options to 
show only pictures with faces, for example, or 
display images in a particular layout. And if you 
need to find a licensed photo to illustrate a 
newsletter, Bing makes that information more 
easily accessible than Google does.
About the only reason to use Google’s 
image search is if you’re hunting down ani-
mated GIF images, as this is an option Bing has 
yet to offer.
4. BING SHOWS MORE 
VIDEO, IF YOU CAN BEAR  
TO LOOK
For whatever reason, the conventional wisdom 
is that Bing is the porn search engine of choice. 
Bing includes social media links, too.
Bing’s Image Search page is attractively formatted, with lots of jumping-off 
points for further exploration.

88   PCWorld   SEPTEMBER 2017
SWITCHING FROM GOOGLE TO BING
FEATURE
Wander through some of 
Reddit’s Microsoft forums, and 
it’ll eventually come up. Heck, 
The Daily Dot even dedicated 
an entire article to it (go.
pcworld.com/tdd). 
Part of the reason is that, even 
with filtering turned off, Google 
now takes a rather puritanical 
attitude toward filtering copy-
righted videos (go.pcworld.
com/syr), while Microsoft has 
adopted a more libertarian 
approach. Bing simply shows you 
videos about your search topic 
from around the web, whether it 
be “baseball” or “boobs.”
That’s not to say that Bing is 
a shadowy corner of the web 
full of smut and depravity. 
Thumbnail images of anything Bing thinks is 
for adults only are blurred out by default. But if 
you’re searching for something tagged Not 
Safe For Work, be aware that Microsoft will 
show it to you (assuming your search filtering 
options allow for it, of course). 
Oddly enough, neither Google nor 
Microsoft shrinks much from violence. Both 
turned up what I assume to be complete 
videos of various hostage beheadings from the 
Middle East, none of which I cared to watch.
MAKE THE SWITCH
If you’re a lifelong Googler and Bing’s advan-
tages intrigue you, great. Here’s how to switch.
As you probably know, Microsoft and 
Google each offer their own browsers to go 
along with their own search engines. With 
Microsoft’s Internet Explorer or Edge and 
Google’s Chrome, the browsers are precon-
figured to use their respective search engines 
by default, accessible via the search bar at the 
top of the screen. (Of course, you can visit 
Bing.com or Google.com and search there 
anytime you’d like.) 
Switching Chrome’s search provider to 
Bing is relatively simple: In the upper-right 
corner of the browser, you’ll see a tiny menu 
Microsoft’s Bing treats you like an adult, if that’s what you’re 
searching for. (Note that you can filter out X-rated searches on 
both Bing and Google.)

SEPTEMBER 2017   PCWorld   89
icon that looks like three horizontal lines on 
top of each other. Click it. Near the bottom of 
the drop-down menu, you’ll see Settings. 
About halfway down the Settings page, you’ll 
see a box for selecting your search engine.
Microsoft hides its search engine configu-
rations as well. If you have Internet Explorer 
configured to use Google, go to the URL bar 
and click the magnifying-glass (search) icon. 
At the bottom right of the drop-down menu, 
click Add. Click the tiny Bing icon at the 
bottom left to set Microsoft’s search engine 
once again as your default. 
About the only change that Bing currently 
foists upon you is sending you to Bing Maps, 
not Google Maps. And if you’re searching for 
videos, guess what: Google’s YouTube isn’t 
exactly Bing’s first choice. 
Bing offers as-good-as-Google search 
capabilities, plus many little added conve-
niences and rewards to entice you to switch. 
Doing so takes just seconds. Are these 
enough to make you try out Bing yourself? It’s 
worth a few minutes of your day to check. 
To change your search provider in Chrome, click the vertical ellipsis (the three vertical dots) icon in 
the top right, then scroll down to Settings. Then go down to this section, here.
Edge should be preconfigured to Bing. (It will be 
locked to Bing if you use Windows 10 S on the 
Surface Laptop or an educational machine.)

ometimes it 
feels like there’s 
only room for 
four choices 
when it comes to web 
browsers on Windows: 
Firefox, Google Chrome, 
Microsoft Edge, and Internet 
Explorer. You’ll find some 
people running Opera, too, 
but for the most part it’s all 
about the big four.
Despite the seemingly small world of web 
browsers, there’s an entire alternative universe 
out there. All of them are fighting for your 
attention with unique features and 
specializations around new interface 
concepts, privacy, music, social media, and 
more. If you’re looking to shake up your 
web-surfing experience, consider these 10 
great browsers not named Firefox, Chrome, 
or Internet Explorer.
1. OPERA NEON
Underpinnings: Blink rendering engine
Focus: Re-imagining the browser
Opera Neon (go.pcworld.com/on1) 
debuted in early 2017 as an experiment in 
interface design and new browser features. 
Opera describes it as a proving ground 
“similar to the way concept cars predict the 
future of automobiles.” In fact, Opera 
released a new version of its mainstream 
browser in May (go.pcworld.com/nv) that 
included some inspiration from Neon.
When you first open up Neon (go.
pcworld.com/n) it’s clear this browser is not 
your typical tabs-at-the-top affair. In fact, you 
don’t even open new tabs in Neon the way 
you do in other browsers. To open a website 
you just start typing the URL or click on one of 
the “link bubbles.”
Opera Neon, just like the official Opera, 
uses Chrome’s Blink rendering engine.
2. VIVALDI
Underpinnings: Chromium
Focus: Power users
Vivaldi (go.pcworld.com/v) is a Chromi-
um-based browser that targets hard-core 
power users. From the moment you install 
it, the browser helps you customize its look 
to suit your needs, including color choices, 
tab position, and start page image. It’s a 
very simple browser at the moment that 
takes cues from current and former Opera 
features (Opera’s former CEO is leading the 

SEPTEMBER 2017   PCWorld   93
Vivaldi effort).
Vivaldi has a speed-dial feature for quick 
access to favorite sites, a built-in note-taking 
app, and a side panel for viewing a secondary 
webpage. Vivaldi also has some features that 
any power user will appreciate, such as 
mouse gestures and keyboard shortcuts, 
saved tab sessions, tab stacks, user interface 
scaling, and adaptive interface colors.
There were early dreams of a built-in mail 
client for Vivaldi, like several 
browsers of old, including 
Opera (go.pcworld.com/o). 
So far, however, Vivaldi has 
only managed to provide its 
own brand of webmail.
As Vivaldi is built on 
Chromium, it is compatible 
with extensions from the 
Chrome Web Store.
3. MAXTHON
Underpinnings: Trident and WebKit
Focus: Multi-device browsing and social
The biggest feature for Maxthon (go.
pcworld.com/max) is its cloud-based 
account, called Passport, which syncs brows-
ing data across your devices. That’s a com-
mon feature among the major players, but not 
as common in the world of alternative brows-
ers. Passport also has a feature called Cloud 

94   PCWorld   SEPTEMBER 2017
FEATURE
10 ALTERNATIVE BROWSERS
Push that lets you 
share content with 
your friends via 
email or text 
message.
Maxthon comes 
with a built-in RSS 
reader, notepad, 
password manager, 
a virtual email 
mailbox service 
called UUMail, and 
AdBlock Plus. There’s also a “reader mode” to 
read articles more easily without all the 
distractions of a typical website.
Maxthon isn’t a single-engine browser, 
instead relying on both Trident (Internet 
Explorer) and WebKit (Safari). Maxthon uses 
WebKit by default, but will switch to Trident 
on the fly for older webpages that are 
friendlier toward Internet Explorer.
4. TORCH
Underpinnings: Chromium
Focus: Media
Torch (go.pcworld.com/to) is a browser 
for media junkies with features for music and 
games. There’s a built-in YouTube-based 
streaming service called Torch Music. Torch 
Games gives you one-click access to a 
selection of web-based games. Torch also 
has some handy drag-and-drop sharing 
features: Drag web content to the left and you 
get a sidebar for sharing content on social 
networks, or drag content to the right to 
search for it.
Torch is also a media-pirate’s dream, with a 
built-in tool for downloading audio and video 
from sites like YouTube and Vimeo, as well as a 
built-in torrent client for…well, you know.
5. EPIC PRIVACY BROWSER
Underpinnings: Chromium
Focus: Privacy
If you like Chrome but don’t like forking 
over all your info to Google and other adver-
tisers, then Epic Privacy Browser (go.pcworld.
com/epb) may be for you.
The browser doesn’t deviate far from its 
Chrome-based roots, but it comes with a 
bunch of privacy-enhancing features like a 
built-in proxy, always-on private browsing, 
and built-in blockers for third-party cookies 
and trackers. It also has a built-in video 
downloading tool that shows up on video 
sites such as YouTube.

SEPTEMBER 2017   PCWorld   95
Epic ditches Google account integration, 
so don’t use this browser if you want to sync 
bookmarks and open browser tabs with 
Google’s servers.
6. PALE MOON
Underpinnings: Goanna (Gecko Fork)
Focus: Legacy Firefox
Do you miss the old Fire-
fox? Not the old, old Firefox, 
but the interface before the 
current one, with the menu 
button in the upper left corner? 
If so, Pale Moon (go.pcworld.
com/pm1) is worth looking at.
Pale Moon was “forked” 
from the core Mozilla project 
with an initial release in 2009. 
Forked means they took the Firefox open 
source code and started iterating it separately 
from Mozilla.
The result is a browser that will be familiar 
to longtime Firefox users, though the two 
browsers are different now, especially under 
the hood. Pale Moon, for example, continues 
to support old-school add-ons as well as 

96   PCWorld   SEPTEMBER 2017
FEATURE
10 ALTERNATIVE BROWSERS
NPAPI plug-ins—that last bit is not necessarily 
a good thing (go.pcworld.com/gt).
7. COMODO ICEDRAGON
Underpinnings: Gecko
Focus: Security
From security firm Comodo, IceDragon 
(go.pcworld.com/idr) is another browser 
promising enhanced security. IceDragon’s 
security props include webpage scanning for 
malware, the use of Comodo’s Secure DNS 
service by default, and active blocking of 
known phishing and spyware sites.
As this is based on Firefox, IceDragon also 
comes with the Pocket add-on pre-installed. 
IceDragon lets you drag content from a 
webpage to the right to share it on social 
networks, and to the left to use that content as 
the basis of a web search.
It has also added a tablet mode that lets you 
switch to larger interface elements when surfing 
the web on a Windows touchscreen device.
8. GHOST BROWSER
Underpinnings: Chromium
Focus: Productivity
Ghost Browser (go.pcworld.com/gb) is 
an interesting idea. It’s built with productivity 
in mind and let’s you create separate browser 
sessions inside the same window. That way 
you can have a set of tabs for your work 
accounts, and another for your personal ones. 
Each session has separate “cookie jars” so 
that you can remain logged in to multiple 
social media or email accounts at the same 
time in separate tabs. Each new session tab is 
automatically assigned a different color.
You can even go one level deeper and 

SEPTEMBER 2017   PCWorld   97
organize sites by “projects” that stash your 
tabs for you. That way you can do a social 
media project with all your various accounts 
open in different tabs, and then swap into 
your party-planning project with tabs open to 
email, list-making tools, calendars, and so on.
Ghost Browser is built on the freemium 
model. That is, it’s free to use, but features are 
limited. If you want a more robust browser 
you have to pay $10 to $15 a month.
The free version is still pretty good. You’re 
limited to three projects and three separate 
tab sessions per project. You can also only 
open one project at a time. Free users don’t 
get an incognito mode or separate user 
profiles either.
As Ghost Browser is built on Chromium it 
works with the Chrome Web Store.
9. MIDORI
Underpinnings: WebKit
Focus: Lightweight
Midori (go.pcworld.com/mdr) is a 
longstanding choice for underpowered 
Linux systems, but there’s also a Windows 
version for anyone who needs a 
lightweight browser.
Midori is pretty simple, lacking any major 
features and sporting an almost XP-like 
interface. On the upside, it’s responsive and 
easy to use. There’s also a portable version if 
you want to run it from a USB stick.

features a “tri-core rendering engine.” Instead 
of choosing one popular browser engine it 
uses those of Firefox, Internet Explorer, and 
Safari.
Avant Browser has several interesting 
features including a “video sniffer” that helps 
you download videos from websites such as 
YouTube. An “always

makes sure that your 
tabs never get buried 
behind other 
desktop applications 
like Outlook, 
Microsoft Word, and 
Photoshop.
Avant’s interface is 
decidedly “Windows

past that, there are all kinds of power-user 
features to satisfy most browser lovers.
That concludes our rundown of the  
latest 10 alternative browsers that have 
caught our attention, but there are others 
out there, and they’re just a quick Google

HOW TO BUILD, MAINTAIN,  
AND FIX YOUR TECH GEAR
6 quick ways to clear space on 
an overstuffed Android device
Zap cached app files in a single tap, clear the Downloads folder, delete unneeded 
offline maps, take charge of music downloads, and more.  BY BEN PATTERSON
F
ew things in life are as annoying as 
finding that your Android handset 
refuses to install any more app 
updates because it’s run out of 
storage. Unlike many of life’s little annoyances, 
though, this one’s easy to fix.  
You can quickly clear out hundreds of 
megabytes or even a gig or two by sweeping 
up stale downloads, rooting out offline maps 
and documents, clearing caches, and wiping 
unneeded music and video files. There’s even 
an easy way to find and nix space-hogging 
apps that you no longer use.
1. CLEAR OUT ALL  
CACHED APP DATA
If you dig into the Apps storage setting screen 
and tap on an individual app, you’ll notice 
IMAGE: BEN PATTERSON/IDG

102   PCWorld   SEPTEMBER 2017
HERE’S HOW
CLEAR ANDROID STORAGE SPACE
that each app has its own stash of “cached” 
data—anywhere from a few kilobytes to 
hundreds of megs, or even more.
These caches of data are essentially just 
junk files, and they can be safely deleted to 
free up storage space. Tap the Clear Cache 
button to take out the trash.
If poking through each and every app 
looking for cached data to clear 
sounds like a chore, there’s an easy 
way to clear all cached app data in one 
fell swoop. Tap Settings > Storage > 
Cached data, then tap OK in the 
confirmation window.
2. CLEAN UP THE 
DOWNLOADS FOLDER
Just like on a PC or a Mac, your 
Android device has a Downloads 
folder, and it’s a favorite hideout for 
miscellaneous junk files downloaded from the 
Web or by your various Android apps.
Open the app drawer and tap Downloads 
to see what’s lurking in the Downloads folder. 
Tap the three-line menu in the top corner of 
the screen and sort the list of downloads by 
size, then take a look at what’s hogging the 
The “cached” 
data used by your 
combined Android 
apps can easily 
take up more 
than a gigabyte of 
storage space.
Tap and hold a file in the Downloads folder and then tap the 
Trash button to delete it.

SEPTEMBER 2017   PCWorld   103
most storage space. If you see anything you 
don’t need, tap and hold the file to select it, 
then tap the Trash button.
3. DUMP PHOTOS THAT ARE 
ALREADY BACKED UP
One of the best features of Google’s new 
Photos app is its ability to back up your entire 
photo library to your online Google account. 
Once your snapshots are safely backed up, 
Photos can zap any locally stored images to 
free up more storage space.
Open the Photos app, tap the three-line 
menu button in the top left corner of the 
screen, then tap Free up device storage. The 
Photos app will let you know how many 
pictures it can delete from local storage; tap 
OK to pull the trigger.
Note: If you’re using the “High quality” 
setting for unlimited but lower-resolution 
cloud storage of your backed up photos, 
keep in mind that the “Free up device 
storage” feature will delete your full-resolution 
originals. Make sure you’ve stored them 
elsewhere before you tap the OK button.
4. MANAGE DOWNLOADED 
MUSIC AND PODCASTS
Google’s Play Music app gives you two 
options when it comes to storing tunes on 
your device: You can manually pick which 
Google Photos will quickly delete any pictures on your device that have already been backed up to your 
Google account.

purchased or uploaded Google Play songs 
and albums get downloaded, or you can let 
the app make those decisions for you. Either 
way, music lovers may end up with a 
significant amount of their device storage 
gobbled up by their favorite artists.
Same goes with podcasts, with Play 
Music’s default setting geared to auto-
download the three most 
recent episodes of each 
subscriptions. If you 
subscribe to more than a 
few podcasts, those 
episodes—and the space 
required to store them on 
your handset—can add up 
quickly.
To check exactly how 
many megabytes or even 
gigabytes of storage Play 
Music has reserved for tunes 
and podcasts, tap the 
three-line menu button in 
the top left corner of the 
screen, then tap Settings > 
Manage downloads. To 
wipe a song download or a 
podcast from local storage, 
tap the orange downloaded 
button to the right of its 
name.
Bonus tip: You can use the 
same method to manage 
your downloads in the Play Movies & TV app.
5. ERASE OFFLINE AREAS IN 
GOOGLE MAPS
Downloading a map in the latest version of 
the Google Maps app is a great way to 
navigate when your device is offline, 
especially now that both searching and 
Downloaded tunes and podcasts in the Play Music app can gobble up 
an impressive amount of storage.
Just tap one of your offline maps in the Google Maps app to update it 
or—if you’re running low on storage space—delete it.

SEPTEMBER 2017   PCWorld   105
driving directions are supported.
But those searchable offline “areas” come 
at a cost: storage space, and potentially lots 
of it. Indeed, a single offline map can 
consume more than a gigabyte of storage 
depending on the size of the area.
You can check how much space your 
offline maps have staked out by tapping the 
three-line menu button in the top left corner 
of the main Google Maps interface, then tap 
Offline. The storage used by each offline map 
is displayed below its nam. Tap the map and 
tap Delete to reclaim its storage space.
6. UNLOAD YOUR  
LEAST-USED APPS
I love the fact that I can download and install 
Android apps to my devices remotely from a 
desktop Web browser. The downside? My 
Android handsets tend to be overstuffed with 
too many apps, many of them used only once 
(or even never).
The solution, of course, is to delete some 
of those apps—ideally, the ones you use the 
least.
To do so, open the Play Store app, tap the 
three-line menu button in the top right corner 
of the screen, tap My apps & games, then tap 
the Installed tab. Next, tap the Sort button 
near the top-right corner of the screen, then 
pick an option, such as Size or—better 
yet—Last Used. If you sort your apps 
according to Last Used, scroll to the very 
bottom of the list to see which apps you use 
the least. See a seldom-used app you could 
do without? Tap it, then tap Uninstall.
There are also several apps that can track 
your app usage and tell you which apps 
you’re using the least. Among them: App 
Usage (go.pcworld.com/au), App Tracker 
(go.pcworld.com/at1), and QualityTime (go.
pcworld.com/qt). 
You can find out which 
apps you use the least 
with help from the Play 
Store app.

How to stop Google Home or 
Amazon Echo from making 
unwanted online purchases
Did you hear about the kindergartner who “accidentally” ordered an expensive 
dollhouse with a voice command? We’ll show you how to lock down your smart 
speaker so that never happens to you. BY FLORENCE ION 
T
here’s no denying that Google 
Home and Amazon Echo (or the 
less-expensive Echo Dot, if 
you’re not using it for music) 
have changed the way we interact with our 
homes. Turning on the lights has never been 
easier, nor has it been simpler to field the 
latest traffic report or order delivery for dinner. 
The future is here, and we’re reveling in it!
But the proliferation of these devices

must always listen for us to utter their magic 
“wake” words—OK Google or Alexa 
respectively—in order to perform their tasks. If 
you don’t configure them properly, you might 
see random purchases show up at your door.
It happened in San Diego (go.pcworld.
com/sdi) when a little girl asked Alexa to 
deliver her a “dollhouse and some cookies.” 
She knew the right words to say, and in a few 
days’ time, she had her goodies. (If you want 
to have some fun, watch this news clip (go.
pcworld.com/ncl) near your Alexa-powered 
device and watch it light up.)
If you’re worried about family members, 
roommates, or pranksters making unwanted 
purchases on your account, you can either 
disable this feature altogether, or set up your 
Google Home or Amazon Echo so that it buys 
things only after you’ve specifically authorized 
the purchase. Here’s how.
HOW TO DISABLE 
PURCHASING WITH 
GOOGLE HOME
Google Home isn’t tied to one of the world’s 
largest online retailers, so you might think 
there’s less of a risk of unintended purchases. 
But it does provide voice-payment capabilities 
for Google Express, which allows you to 
purchase products from participating retailers 
such as Costco, Target, and Toys ‘R Us.
The payments setting is disabled by 
default in the Google Home app. If you’d 
enabled it previously and have since 
Google Home doesn’t 
have the retail power 
of Amazon behind 
it, but you can order 
merchandise from 
such major sources as 
Costco, Target, and 
Toys ‘R Us.

changed your mind, it’s easy to turn off. 
Just log into the Home app on your 
Android or iOS device, tap the hamburger 
menu, and choose “More settings.” Tap 
“Payments” on the next screen. Delete 
everything you see there. It’s the easiest 
way to ensure no one in your household 
can run rampant with your payment 
information on file. Alternatively, you can 
simply tick the “Pay through your 
Assistant” option so that it’s off and 
unselected.
HOW TO ENABLE 
PURCHASES ON  
GOOGLE HOME
If you want to start—or restart—making 
payments with voice commands, open the 
Google Home app, tap the menu button, and 
then tap on Payments. Here you can set up a 
delivery address and a primary payment 
method. Google will automatically pull in any 
payment data previously associated with your 
account (and prompt you to update any 
expired or out-of-date cards). The app will ll 
also ask if you want to grant access to any 
Google Home devices you have set up in 
your home.
Once you’ve set that up, you can order 
things through Google Home by saying 
phrases such as “OK Google, order paper 
towels.” Google Home will list options for 
relevant items and their accompanying 
prices. Then, you can accept the order to 
If you decide you don’t want to do voice payments 
with Google Home, just flip the blue switch.
You can enable and disable ordering on Google 
Home via the Home app.

place it officially.
You can even ask, “OK Google, how do I 
shop?” for a helpful walkthrough of the 
process. For other services, such as Domino’s 
pizza delivery (go.pcworld.com/dpd), the 
payment information is set up separately 
through that company’s Easy Order, which 
fires up the oven right after you place your 
order. (This works with the Echo as well.)
DISABLING PURCHASING 
ON THE AMAZON ECHO, 
DOT, TAP, AND SHOW
Amazon’s smart speakers are quickly 
becoming smart-home workhorses, but they 
could also be considered Trojan horses aimed 
at capturing more and more of your shopping 
dollars.Here’s how to disable—and then 
re-enable—purchasing power with an 
Amazon Echo, Dot, Tap, or Show.
If you’ve previously enabled payments any 
of your Amazon Echos and want to now 
disable it, just launch the Alexa app on your 
smartphone or tablet. If you have more than 
one device in the Echo family, you’ll need 
scroll past all of them—and past the blue “Set 
up a new device” button—until you reach the 
“Voice Purchasing” button. Click on the radio 
button to disable this feature. You’re done.
HOW TO ENABLE 
PURCHASES VIA THE 
AMAZON ECHO
Under Settings, scroll down to “Voice 
Purchasing.” Tap to enable “Purchase by 
voice.” It’s a good idea to set up a

confirmation code at this point. It willl ensure 
no one can order things without your 
permission unless they know the code. Below 
that, you can select to manage your 1-Click 
payment settings, which selects which of your 
bank cards to use when the purchasing 
happens.
When you’re ready to buy something, you 
can ask Alexa to order anything from 
Amazon—physical as well as digital goods. If 
you’re listening to a song, for example, you 
can ask Amazon to purchase the MP3 with 
your payment information on file. Or if you’re 
in need of toilet paper, you can ask Alexa to 
send it over with two-day shipping.
If you’re stuck, or maybe a little shy, ask 
Alexa how to shop and it’ll walk you through 
what it can do.
WHEN IN DOUBT, MUTE IT
If all else fails and your neighboring dwellers 
are still managing to make errant purchases, 
you can either unplug the device or mute it. 
The latter is particularly effective if you have 
children coming over who find it amusing to 
summon virtual assistants.
Then again, who doesn’t? It’s why we use 
our voices to buy things, after all, simply 
because we can. 
Amazon gives you the 
option of adding a 
confirmation code that 
must be spoken for an 
order to be placed.
When you’re ready to buy 
something, you can ask
