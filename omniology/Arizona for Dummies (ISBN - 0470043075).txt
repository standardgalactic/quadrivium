About the Author
Edie Jarolim has worn many hats — not counting the sombrero she
donned on a certain one-margarita-too-many night. . . . She has a Ph.D. in
American literature from New York University and was a senior editor at
Frommer’s travel guides in New York before being lured by the warm sun
and endless vistas — not to mention the inexpensive real estate — to
Tucson, Arizona, in 1992. She has since written about the Southwest and
Mexico for a variety of national publications, ranging from Art & Antiques
and Brides to National Geographic Traveler, The New York Times Book
Review, and the Wall Street Journal, and is a frequent contributor to
Tucson Guide Quarterly and Tucson Home. She is also the author of
Frommer’s San Antonio & Austin.
Author’s Acknowledgments
It has been a decade and a half since Marjorie Magnusson and Leia
James of the Arizona Office of Tourism warmly welcomed a flustered
travel writer who, new to the many mysteries of driving, showed up
more than an hour late for her first lunch in Scottsdale with them. My
ability to judge distances between cities is a bit better these days, but
the helpfulness and good spirits of everyone I’ve worked with at the
Arizona Office of Tourism have remained unchanged. In addition to
Marjorie — who continues to be an invaluable resource — I’d particu-
larly like to thank Jacki Mieler and Heather Koncilja for their assistance.
If I could individually thank all the people who assisted me in getting to
know Arizona, this book would be twice the size, so I’ll restrict myself 
to those in the organizations that most directly helped to facilitate my
research for the 4th edition of this guide. They are (in alphabetical 
order by destination):  Luanne Matson (TMC Group, Inc. for Cochise
County); Meg Roederer (Flagstaff Convention and Visitors Bureau);
Dwayne Cassidy (Page-Lake Powell Chamber of Commerce); Brett Brooks
(Phoenix Convention & Visitors Bureau); Sachiko Sado and Jennifer
Wesselhoff (Sedona–Oak Creek Chamber of Commerce); Laura McMurchie,
Tatum Ostaff, Michelle Streeter (Scottsdale Convention & Visitors Bureau);
Toni Graham (Tempe Convention & Visitors Bureau); Kimberly Schmitz
(Metropolitan Tucson Convention & Visitors Bureau) and Julie Brooks
(Wickenburg Chamber of Commerce).
Special thanks go to Nikki Buchanan, Phoenix Magazine’s food critic, for
her expert advice on Valley restaurants; and to Kate Davis, Kira Hesser,
Kathy McMahon, and Austin Pederson for their invaluable research
assistance.

Arizona For Dummies, 4th Edition

Introduction
I
always enjoy hearing friends who have never been to Arizona give
their impressions of my adopted home state: “It’s all desert, isn’t it?”
they say, or “It’s all canyons,” or “It’s all Native Americans living on
reservations,” or “It’s all fat cats playing golf.”
Kind of reminds me of the story of the group of blindfolded men who,
when asked to describe an elephant after having examined a small 
section of one, each come up with a completely different, fantastical
description of it.
Like an elephant, Arizona is very large and can’t be characterized by any
one of its parts. But just because you haven’t visited the state or have had
only a limited experience with it, you don’t have to take after those short-
sighted pachyderm probers. With Arizona For Dummies, 4th Edition, you
see not only desert and canyons, American Indian reservations, and fat
cats on golf courses, but also the best of the myriad sights and attractions
that make the state such a popular destination.
About This Book
Forget all those other guidebooks, where you have to wade through a
small forest’s worth of paper to find out the one thing you wanted to
know. Arizona For Dummies, 4th Edition is a reference book as well as a
guide, which means that you don’t have to read it from cover to cover —
or even from front to back. Each section and chapter is as self-contained
as possible, so you can concentrate on what’s important to you at the
moment. You can always flip to a different section later if you feel like it.
Just because the chapters are self-contained, though, doesn’t mean that
I keep repeating myself. I’ve been cornered at enough weddings by bores
who want to keep telling me the same stories about their trip to Hawaii
to know better (of course, trips to Arizona are endlessly fascinating). If I
cover a topic that interests you in one section of the book, I refer you to
that area rather than waste your time — and mine — by going over the
information again.
Please be advised that travel information is subject to change at any
time — especially prices. I therefore suggest that you write or call ahead
for confirmation when making your travel plans. The authors, editors,
and publisher can’t be held responsible for the experiences of readers
while traveling. Your safety is important to us, however, so we encour-
age you to stay alert and be aware of your surroundings. Keep a close
eye on cameras, purses, and wallets — all favorite targets of thieves and
pickpockets.

Conventions Used in This Book
In this book, in addition to lists of my favorite hotels and restaurants, I
also include some general pricing information to help you as you decide
where to unpack your bags or dine on the local cuisine. I use a system of
dollar signs to show a range of costs for one night in a hotel (the price
refers to a double-occupancy room) or a meal for one person at a restau-
rant (including appetizer, entree, and dessert). Check out the following
table to decipher the dollar signs:
Cost
Hotel
Restaurant
$
$100 or less
$12 or less
$$
$101–$200
$13–$25
$$$
$201–$300
$26–$50
$$$$
$301–$400
$51–$75
$$$$$
$401 and more
$76 and more
Throughout the book, I also use abbreviations for credit cards. Sorry, I
had room only for the biggies, so although your local discount club or
gas card may well be accepted in Arizona, I couldn’t include everything.

Dummies Post-it® Flags
As you’re reading this book, you’ll find information that you may want to reference as
you plan or enjoy your trip — whether a new hotel, a must-see attraction, or a must-
try walking tour. Mark these pages with the handy Post-it® Flags included in this book
to help make your trip planning easier.

To make pertinent information stand out, attractions and main tele-
phone numbers (usually toll-free) are in bold typeface.
Foolish Assumptions
As I wrote this book, I made some assumptions about you and what your
needs may be as a traveler. Here’s what I assume:
 You’re an experienced traveler who doesn’t have much time to
really get to know Arizona and wants expert advice when you
finally do get a chance to further explore the state.
 You’re not looking for a book that provides all the information avail-
able about Arizona or that lists every hotel, restaurant, or attrac-
tion available. Instead, you’re looking for a book that focuses on the
places that give you the best or most unique experiences in this
beautiful state.
How This Book Is Organized
The information in this book is methodically arranged in an easy-to-use,
logical fashion (I’m glad you can’t see the stacks of paper piled on my
home office floor). The book is divvied up into five parts, each one cov-
ering a major aspect of your trip. Those parts are then further subdi-
vided into chapters that cover more specific topics, so you can zoom in
on the one that interests you. The sections break down as follows.
Part I: Introducing Arizona
In this part, I introduce you to Arizona, past and present, as well as to
some of the most outstanding experiences in the state. I also fill you in on
what you need to consider when planning a trip to Arizona — everything
from the dates of major festivals to the weather at different times of the
year. I even offer you several possible itineraries based on your interests
and traveling companions (well, if they’re kids).
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Arizona
This nitty-gritty section walks you through those potentially difficult
trip-planning stages. I cover the top ways to make travel arrangements,
whether you decide to go it on your own, book an escorted tour, or do
something in-between; the types of transportation you find in Arizona;
your accommodation options; and the best way to deal with money mat-
ters and (heaven forbid) illness while you’re on the road. I also devote a
chapter to special interests, from seniors to families and astronomy
geeks (sometimes those special interests overlap). This part also helps
you wrap up those last-minute details — everything from buying travel
insurance to finding the best cellphone.
Introduction 3

Part III: Exploring the Big Cities
Here you find out all about Greater Phoenix and Tucson, including the
lowdown on hotels, restaurants, sights, tours, activities, shops, and
nightlife in Arizona’s two major cities. I don’t overload you with choices,
though: I cut to the chase with the best options. I also explain why I
think they’re prime — that way, you can decide whether you agree (in
other words, I can’t make you like Garth Brooks, but I can tell you I think
a bar is great because it plays his music all the time). Two additional
chapters in this section give you the details on fun side trips you can
take from each of the cities.
Part IV: Exploring the Regions
This part does for Arizona’s top touring regions what Part III does for the
cities, only on a larger scale. I pare down info even more than in the city
chapters. For example, because the Grand Canyon has no nightlife to
speak of, I don’t include a section on nightlife. For details on the regions
I chose and the reasons I chose them, see Chapter 3 (see, I told you I
wasn’t going to repeat myself).
Part V: The Part of Tens
No, this part isn’t something out of Star Trek, although “Seven of Nine”
may come to mind (if you’re a bit of a Trekkie as — I confess — I am).
Perhaps David Letterman’s Top Ten list is somewhat closer to the mark.
This fun section highlights characteristics of — some may say peculiari-
ties of — Arizona, including the top crafts to buy, the prime desert ani-
mals for you to look (and look out) for, and ten quintessential Arizona
foodstuffs.
You also find one other element near the back of this book. I include an
appendix — your Quick Concierge — containing handy information
about services in Arizona, such as phone numbers and Web sites for air-
lines, hotel chains, car-rental agencies, local newspapers and magazines,
and tourist information centers. You also find contact information for
area hospitals, pharmacies, and police. Check out the appendix when
searching for answers to little questions that may come up as you travel,
or even before you leave.
Icons Used in This Book
You will notice the following icons sprinkled throughout the text. Think
of them as signposts: I use them to highlight special tips, draw your
attention to must-see destinations, and give you a heads-up on a variety
of topics.
This icon alerts you to money-saving tips (such as, “Never buy retail” —
oops, that’s another book) and/or great deals.
Arizona For Dummies, 4th Edition 
4

Not only does this book advise you on the top destinations, restaurants,
and activities in the state, but Chapter 1 winnows down my picks even
further, selecting the best in several categories. As you go through the
various chapters, these icons remind you of what I’ve chosen as the
crème de la crème.
Watch for this warning about rip-offs, tourist traps, and other details.
Although this entire book is devoted to giving you useful advice, this
symbol lets you know when you should really pay attention if you want
to make the most of your time and energy.
This icon is your green light for attractions, hotels, restaurants, and
activities that are particularly family-friendly.
A gentle nudge in the ribs comes from this icon that points out sights,
attractions, and things you’re unlikely to see outside of the Southwest.
These places tend to be historic, but some new attractions manage to
achieve that ineffable Southwest-specific quality.
Where to Go from Here
Well, to Arizona of course. Oh, you want me to be a little more specific?
Just dip into these pages as you would into a Phoenix swimming pool in
February — one toe at a time until you realize just how inviting the water
is and take the plunge. Most importantly, get prepared to have a blast. We
like everything from clothing styles to tequila shots kicked back here in
Arizona, and a little hootin’ and hollerin’ is definitely permitted.

Part I
Introducing Arizona

In this part . . .
S
o you think you want to go to Arizona — but what’s the
state really like, anyway? When’s the best time to go?
What are the top travel routes? What resources are available
to you if you’re single, traveling with a family, gay, or mobility
impaired? So many questions — and so many answers. Think
of this part as Arizona 101, a quick introduction to the state’s
geography, travel economics, and more.

Chapter 1
Discovering the Best 
of Arizona
In This Chapter
 Searching out the top historical sites and attractions
 Finding the best places to explore Native American culture
 Participating in Arizona’s myriad activities
 Seeing glorious Western film–style landscapes
 Shopping for the top arts and crafts
 Discovering the best historic lodgings
 Dining at Arizona’s top Southwest restaurants
P
icture a land of silent, manly men and spirited, sun-worn women
leaving clouds of dust in the wake of their pickups as they hightail 
it through rugged canyon lands and parched deserts. Of noble braves in
touch with Earth’s ancient wisdom. Of lonely Mexican cantinas and run-
down roadside cafes . . .
Then give it a name: Arizona.
Okay. You’ve obviously watched too many Westerns and pickup-truck
commercials.
Me, too. Before I moved to Tucson, nearly a decade and a half ago, I had
many of the same preconceptions about the state.
As it happens, the men in Arizona are far more likely to golf, hike, or
mountain bike than to rope cattle, and the sassiest females are generally
from New York City, like me. Women here know better than to go out-
doors without slathering on sunscreen, and if their skin gets parched,
they head for the nearest spa. More contrasts to your possible precon-
ceived notions: Arizona’s Sonoran Desert is lush with vegetation, much
of the income of the southern Native American nations comes from casi-
nos, and a long line often forms for the best Mexican restaurants, which
tend to be in lively downtown barrios.

Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Arizona 11

But back to those preconceived notions. The Arizona scenery is indeed
as spectacular as anything you’d ever imagine (more than 80 percent of
the state is undeveloped), ancient traditions are alive and well on the
Indian reservations, and several cattle ranches are still active — some
even rent out their rooms.
And Arizona has long stretches of open roads and a highway speed limit
of 75 mph. Zooming down those wide stretches of macadam with your
favorite tunes blaring on the radio, you may well experience the freedom
and exhilaration you view in Hollywood versions of the Southwest.
This chapter, then, offers some of the best experiences that the state has
to offer, proof that the reality of Arizona is as good as — in some places
even better than — the fantasy.
Best Historic Attractions
Over the centuries, Arizona has been home to conquistadors, missionar-
ies, miners, and a variety of American Indian tribes — all of whom left
their marks on the landscape. Today, these historic sites are among the
state’s biggest tourism draws.
 Taliesin West (North Scottsdale): Who says historic sites have to
be really old? In the urban sprawl of greater Phoenix, Frank Lloyd
Wright’s former home and architectural studio stands out for its
integration of architecture and nature. See Chapter 11.
 Mission San Xavier del Bac: This Spanish Moorish–style church is
not only lovely, but, as an active Native American parish, it serves
as a testament to Arizona’s rich living history. See Chapter 13.
 Bisbee: The entire hilly town — a kind of San Francisco in 
miniature — gives visitors a more charming glimpse of Arizona’s
mining history than one may expect. See Chapter 15.
 Tumacácori National Historical Park (Tumacácori): The haunting
ruins of a mission, the fine historical displays, not to mention the
tranquility of the gardens and grassy courtyard, all make this a
prime spot to soak in the past. See Chapter 15.
 Jerome: Its perch on Cleopatra Hill, ramshackle buildings, and
array of mining exhibits make this one-time ghost town a must-see.
See Chapter 16.
 Sharlot Hall Museum: The territorial history of Arizona is high-
lighted in this array of historic structures, a collection put together
by a pioneering woman. See Chapter 16.
 Grand Canyon Village Historical District: Tear your eyes away
from nature for an hour or so to explore what man — and woman
(architect Mary Colter, to be specific) — wrought at the edge of the
abyss. See Chapter 17.
Part I: Introducing Arizona 
12

 Riordan Mansion State Historic Park: For insight into Arizona’s
logging history, you can’t beat this sprawling home built by two
lumber-baron brothers. See Chapter 17.
 Holbrook: Dinosaurs, wigwams, neon signs . . . you won’t find 
a better place in Arizona to view classic Route 66 kitsch. See
Chapter 18.
 Hubbell Trading Post National Historic Site: The former home of
trader Lorenzo Hubbell is among the many lures of this still-active
trading post. See Chapter 18.
Best Places to Explore Native American
Culture
From A.D. 200 to A.D. 1300, Native American tribes had this country pretty
much to themselves, sharing it only with the animals that freely roamed
the land. The evidence of their civilizations is found throughout the state.
 The Heard Museum (Downtown Phoenix): Combining historic dis-
plays with exhibits of contemporary Native American works, this
world-class museum is a must for anyone interested in Southwest
Indian culture. See Chapter 11.
 Casa Grande Ruins National Monument: If not Arizona’s largest
Native American ruins, these are among the most elusive. What is
that tall building anyway — and what’s with all those fire pits? See
Chapter 14.
 Amerind Foundation Museum (Dragoon): If you like your muse-
ums compact and in scenic settings, don’t pass up this small collec-
tion of Native American artifacts. See Chapter 15.
 Montezuma Castle National Monument: An easy detour off
Highway 17 is rewarded by the sight of a couple of well-preserved
ancient apartment houses and, nearby, a dazzlingly blue, spring-fed
pool. See Chapter 16.
 Museum of Northern Arizona: Find out about the native peoples 
of the Colorado Plateau in this historic building, which hosts a fine
series of Native American markets in summer. See Chapter 17.
 Walnut Canyon National Monument: Here you have an opportu-
nity to clamber among intact Sinagua ruins, nestled in a beautiful
piney canyon. See Chapter 17.
 Canyon de Chelly National Monument: The Navajos have steward-
ship over — and dwell in — these spectacular canyons, which also
host the former homes of ancestral Puebloans. See Chapter 18.
 Hopi Mesas: Talk about living history. The Hopi people live on the
three mesas that their ancestors settled centuries ago, and they
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Arizona 13

still observe many of the same customs as their forebears. See
Chapter 18.
 Navajo National Monument: A gorgeous, serene setting and dra-
matic cliff dwellings — Native American sites don’t get much better
than this. See Chapter 18.
Best Activities
The state’s warm, sunny climate is an outdoors-lover’s dream. Even the
winter cold in the northern regions of the state isn’t all that cold — but
it’s cold enough to make Flagstaff a winter sports mecca.
 Golfing in Greater Phoenix: If you’re a duffer, you won’t find a
better collection of challenging desert courses than in the Valley of
the Sun. See Chapter 11.
 Driving the Apache Trail: Motoring through the long and winding —
and oh-so-scenic — road that takes you through the Superstition
Mountains is an adventure in itself. See Chapter 12.
 Horseback riding in Tucson: No other city affords so many 
opportunities to canter among lush stands of saguaro cacti. See
Chapter 13.
 Stargazing at Kitt Peak National Observatory: Star light, star
bright — Kitt Peak’s dinner/observing program is heavenly. See
Chapter 14.
 Observing hummingbirds in southern Arizona: Even those who
find bird-watching tedious are enchanted by the tiny critters flitting
around this region’s nature preserves. See Chapter 15.
 Mountain biking in Sedona: Sedona’s many bike-rental shops attest
to the allure of fat-tiring among the red rocks. See Chapter 16.
 Riding the Verde Canyon Railroad: Eagles and wildflowers and
canyons, oh my! You never know what kind of show Mother Nature
will put on for you. See Chapter 16.
 Rafting the Colorado River in and around the Grand Canyon: The
surrounding canyon walls are spectacular, and you don’t have to
white-knuckle it in whitewater — gentle float trips are also an
option. See Chapter 17.
 Descending into one of the slot canyons near Page: Whether it’s
the popular Antelope Canyon or the more remote Canyon X, this
region’s skinny, dune-formed caves are a photographer’s dream.
See Chapter 18.
 Hiking Canyon de Chelly’s White Horse Ruin Trail: The only trek
into the canyon you can take without a Navajo guide rewards your
(modest) efforts with an ancient cliff dwelling at the trail’s end. See
Chapter 18.
Part I: Introducing Arizona 
14

Best Places to See Western 
Film–Style Landscapes
The Westerns of film directors like John Ford are synonymous with the
tumbleweed desert landscapes found in Arizona. See them for yourself
at the following locations.
 Boyce Thompson Arboretum: The array of desert specimens in
this off-the-beaten-path preserve is eye-popping, as are the sand-
stone boulders that serve as the plants’ backdrop. See Chapter 12.
 Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum: You see impressive spreads of
desert in many parts of southern Arizona, but you’re never guaran-
teed a peek at the fauna that dwell in them — except in this won-
derful zoo. See Chapter 13.
 Saguaro National Park: Gigantic saguaro cacti grow almost exclu-
sively in Arizona and northern Mexico, and you find no better place
to view them than in this prickly preserve. See Chapter 13.
 Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument: The skinny-armed cousin
of the saguaro is the star of this desert park near the U.S./Mexico
border and the Tohono O’odham Indian reservation. See Chapter 14.
 Chiricahua National Monument (Dos Cabezas Route): You’ll be
bowled over by the weirdly balanced boulders of the “Land of the
Standing-Up Rocks,” the rugged terrain where Cochise and his band
of Apaches hid out from the U.S. cavalry. See Chapter 15.
 Red rocks of Sedona: The startlingly vermillion rocks and mesas
around Sedona have inspired artists and filmmakers from the 1930s
on. See Chapter 16.
 The Grand Canyon: Celluloid can’t fully capture this sight’s gaping
grandeur — probably for the best, because no actor could compete
with this scene stealer. See Chapter 17.
 Canyon de Chelly National Monument: These sheer cliffs painted
with “desert varnish” — a blue-black veneer formed by seeping
water — are among the most awe-inspiring sights in the Southwest.
See Chapter 18.
 Lake Powell: Adding water to Glen Canyon only enhanced its appeal,
although the submerged rock formations seem a bit surreal. See
Chapter 18.
 Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park: The favorite “set” of film-
maker John Ford, these strangely shaped spires and mesas have
come to symbolize the West for generations of cineastes. See

 The Painted Desert: Petrified Forest National Park provides a good
showcase for one of the West’s softer landscapes, with its delicate
shades of pink, dun, and sienna. See Chapter 18.
Best Places to Shop for Arts and Crafts
Artisans and craftspeople flock to Arizona as much for the quality of
light and natural beauty as for the relatively inexpensive rents. Their
wares, along with the distinctive crafts made by Native American tribes,
make Arizona a rich source of original American artwork.
 Downtown Scottsdale: Fans of Western art, of both the cowboy and
American Indian variety, won’t find much better pickin’s than on
thoroughfares like 5th Avenue and Main Street. See Chapter 11.
 The Heard Museum gift shop (downtown Phoenix): Here you find
an excellent selection of Native American crafts at reasonable
prices (the artists aren’t charged a gallery fee). See Chapter 11.
 The Lost Barrio: Southwest and ethnic furnishings and accessories
are the focus of this collection of shops in an old warehouse dis-
trict in Tucson. See Chapter 13.
 Old Town Artisans: The work of local, regional, and Latin American
artists is showcased at these shops in a historic building occupying
an entire city block in downtown Tucson. See Chapter 13.
 Kitt Peak National Observatory gift shop: Because the observa-
tory is on land owned by the Tohono O’odham Indians, its visitor
center carries many of the fine baskets made by tribal members.
See Chapter 14.
 Nogales: Bargaining is part of the adventure of shopping for crafts
in this Mexican border town. See Chapter 15.
 Tubac: Arizona’s oldest European settlement is now a haven for
local artists and crafters — as well as importers of wares from
Mexico. See Chapter 15.
 Jerome: The hippies who revived this one-time ghost town brought
along their craftsy ways. Some of the shops lining Jerome’s two
main streets have gone upscale, but others retain an endearing
quirkiness. See Chapter 16.
 Tlaquepaque Arts & Crafts Village: Practically all of Sedona is an
arts and crafts zone, but you find the greatest concentration of
high-quality boutiques in this charming Mexican-village replica. See
Chapter 16.
 Cameron Trading Post: You may be overwhelmed by the huge
array of crafts at this Navajo-owned gift shop/grocery near the east
entrance of the Grand Canyon’s South Rim. See Chapter 17.
Part I: Introducing Arizona

 Hubbell Trading Post National Historic Site: Come here for one of
the best selections of antique Navajo rugs in the state; also watch
new rugs being woven. See Chapter 18.
 Second Mesa: A smattering of crafts shops on Second Mesa, includ-
ing the excellent Tsakurshovi, make this the prime place on the
Hopi reservation to find katsina dolls and silver inlay jewelry. See
Chapter 18.
Best Historic Lodgings
Many of the state’s historic properties have survived and been reborn as
vacation lodgings. The following are my picks for the best in the state.
 Arizona Biltmore Resort & Spa (Phoenix/Camelback Corner): This
Frank Lloyd Wright–inspired resort, nearly 80 years old, continues
to add amenities without subtracting character. See Chapter 11.
 Camelback Inn, a JW Marriott Resort & Spa (Scottsdale):
Scottsdale’s first luxury resort has retained its old-fashioned appeal
while keeping up with the times (most recently by rebuilding its
excellent spa). See Chapter 11.
 Royal Palms Resort and Spa (Phoenix): Built as a winter getaway
for a wealthy couple, this intimate property still fulfills that func-
tion, although now more upscale pairs can come to play. See
Chapter 11.
 Kay El Bar Ranch: This dude ranch remains faithful to its historic
Western roots but offers a touch of Hollywood glamour as well: Val
Kilmer’s family owned the ranch for a spell, and little Val used to
hang out with the horses. See Chapter 12.
 Arizona Inn: Tucson was a desert outpost when the Arizona Inn
opened in 1930. Although the city is no longer primitive, this
charming property still provides the same civility it afforded weary
travelers in the past. See Chapter 13.
 Hacienda del Sol Guest Ranch Resort: A girls’ school turned dude
ranch to the stars in the 1940s, this is now a scenic miniresort with
artfully rustic rooms that offer all the creature comforts. See
Chapter 13.
 The Royal Elizabeth Bed & Breakfast Inn: Lovers of Victoriana will
adore these downtown Tucson digs, with immaculately maintained
fittings and gorgeous antique furnishings. See Chapter 13.
 Westward Look Resort: Among the legacies of this property’s guest
ranch past are spacious quarters designed for long-term stays,
along with a generous spread of desert with great city views. See
Chapter 13.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Arizona 17

 Copper Queen (Bisbee): A holdover from Arizona’s days of mineral
wealth, this hotel still offers lots of Old West charm. See Chapter 15.
 Tubac Golf Resort: Founded in 1959 by a group of investors that
included crooner Bing Crosby, this gracious property sits on
Arizona’s first Spanish land grant. Conferences are held in an 1880s
hacienda. See Chapter 15.
 Hassayampa Inn: Prescott’s premier historic hotel helped usher in
Arizona’s auto age with its modern covered driveway. Today’s visi-
tors like the fact that it’s within easy walking distance of the town’s
Courthouse Square. See Chapter 16.
 El Tover Hotel: The grandest of the Grand Canyon lodgings closed
briefly for a makeover in its 100th anniversary year, 2005, and
emerged better than ever, with accommodations as appealing as 
its public areas. See Chapter 17.
 Grand Canyon Lodge: It would be hard to find a better complement
to the woodsy beauty of the North Rim than this impressive lime-
stone-and-log structure flanked by rustic cabins. See Chapter 17.
 Goulding’s Lodge: Ever since Harry Goulding brought director
John Ford out to his place, it has been a favorite of filmmakers, who
like its proximity to Monument Valley as well as the modern con-
veniences subtly incorporated over the years. See Chapter 18.
 La Posada: Resuscitated in the 1990s, the hotel that architect 
Mary Colter created in Winslow in 1930 just keeps getting better, 
as the gardens mature and more original fittings are restored. See
Chapter 18.
 Thunderbird Lodge: This hotel, the only one inside Canyon de
Chelly National Monument, features a dining room that used to be a
trading post and cottonwoods planted in the 1930s by the Civilian
Conservation Corps. See Chapter 18.
Best Places to Savor Southwest Flavors
New Southwestern cuisine is the nouveau cousin of the standard Mexican/
cowboy fare traditionally found in these parts. But you won’t have trouble
finding standout versions of the latter in restaurants throughout the state.
Here are my recommended places to dine.
 Kai (near Phoenix): Here, dazzling New Southwestern recipes incor-
porate traditional ingredients grown on the reservation of the Pima
and Maricopa Indians. See Chapter 11.
 Los Sombreros (Scottsdale): This lively eatery departs from typical
northern Mexico fare to range all over our southern neighbor’s
map. See Chapter 11.
Part I: Introducing Arizona 
18

 Roaring Fork (Scottsdale): Innovative takes on steak and other
Western menu staples make chef Robert McGrath’s restaurant a
favorite with Valley foodies and meat-and-potato types alike. See
Chapter 11.
 Café Poca Cosa: For far-flung regional dishes not found in most of
Arizona’s Mexican restaurants, you can’t beat this colorful down-
town Tucson cafe. See Chapter 13.
 Janos/J Bar: The food at upscale Janos has a French accent, while
that at more casual J Bar speaks with Mexican tones. These adja-
cent restaurants share the talents of Southwest cooking guru Janos
Wilder. See Chapter 13.
 La Roca el Balcon (Nogales, Mexico): Savory seafood and grilled
meat dishes are among the offerings at this cavernous, romantic
taverna. See Chapter 15.
 The Cowboy Club’s Silver Saddle Room: The rattlesnake brochettes
at this haute-rustic eatery in Uptown Sedona may be gimmicky, but
the ribs, steak, seafood — and even buffalo cuts — are seriously
good. See Chapter 16.
 Cameron Trading Post dining room: Under the pressed tin roof of
this historic dining room, you find the best Navajo taco in Arizona —
huge and made with fresh hot fry bread. See Chapter 17.
 Romo’s Cafe: The New Mexican–style food at this low-key Holbrook
cafe will bring happiness if you’re a fan of sopaipillas (fried bread
sweetened with honey), red and green chile sauce, and other
imports from the Land of Enchantment. See Chapter 18.
 The Turquoise Room: Drawing on the menu of the Santa Fe rail-
road’s luxury dining car and on Arizona regional specialties, the
restaurant at La Posada in Winslow features everything from Hopi
piki bread to chile-cherry duckling. See Chapter 18.

S
ure, Arizona has terrific weather and dozens of ways to play in it, but
it also has a rich history, not to mention distinctive architecture and
cuisine. You may have already developed a taste for Arizona’s heritage,
style, and way of life through the many books written and films made in
which Arizona plays a prominent role. For more insight into what you’ll
be looking at, listening to, and ingesting when you visit, read on.
History 101: The Main Events
Once upon a time, before Sun City and other retirement communities
went forth and multiplied, Arizona was a magnet for the young and the
restless: conquistadors, missionaries, miners, and a variety of Native
American tribes. The following sections give you, briefly, some of their
stories.
Early arrivals
More than 15,000 years ago, the southern sector of the region now known
as Arizona was the territory of mammoth hunters, but, hairy elephants
aside, the action didn’t pick up until about A.D. 200, when the Ancestral
Puebloans (also called the Anasazi) arrived. After centuries of making
baskets in modest pit houses, they started to build pueblos — see the
“Building Blocks: Local Architecture” section later in this chapter — and
carve homes out of cliffs at places like Canyon de Chelly and Navajo
National Monument; no one is quite sure why they built these early

“condos” so high. The Sinagua settled in the fertile plateau near Flagstaff
(Walnut Canyon and Wupatki) and the Verde River valley (Tuzigoot and
Montezuma Castle), while the Hohokam farmed the Gila and Salt river
valleys between Phoenix and Casa Grande, leaving behind remnants of a
huge irrigation system, as well as the Casa Grande ruin, and lots of petro-
glyphs (rock carvings). By 1300 A.D., most of these tribes had, literally,
gone on to greener pastures: A major drought in the mid-1200s likely
caused their mass migration out of the area.
The Spanish are coming (and the Native Americans
are going)
Enter the Spanish conquistadors, who rode through Arizona in the early
16th century looking for gold but finding mostly trouble. Around 1600, 
in the Four Corners region, they clashed with the Navajo, themselves 
relative newcomers to the neighborhood. The conquistadors’ religious
brethren came out alright: Links in the chain of missions that the Jesuits
established in the Sonoran Desert at the end of the 17th century included
Tumacácori and San Xavier del Bac in southern Arizona. Still, not every-
one was thrilled by the padres’ presence. In 1751, in response to a Pima
Indian uprising, the presidio (military post) of Tubac — Arizona’s first per-
manent European settlement — was built to protect Tumacácori. After the
presidio was moved north to Tucson in 1775, Tubac never recovered.
Mexico threw off the reign of Spain in 1821 but didn’t hold on to most of
Arizona for long, as a consequence of losing the Mexican-American War
(1848). Five years later, General Santa Anna — yes, that Santa Anna, of
Alamo fame — sold off the state’s remaining bits, including Tucson, in
the Gadsden Purchase. Thus, America inherited the Indian wars. In 1864,
the U.S. Army, under Colonel Kit Carson, defeated the Navajos in north-
east Arizona. The Chiricahua Apaches, led by Cochise and Geronimo,
held out against the Anglos in the southeast a little longer, but Cochise
died in 1874, and Geronimo surrendered in 1886.
Mining the store
One of the reasons the U.S. Army tangled with the Apaches was to protect
the region’s mining interests. Many of the gold-rushing ’49ers from the
East never made it to California, instead lingering in the adjacent territory
to try their luck. Silver and, eventually, copper turned out to be Arizona’s
mother lodes, and Tombstone and Bisbee became the largest — and
wildest — towns in the state.
Things were a bit calmer to the north, where farmers in newly founded
Phoenix irrigated fields using canals that had been dug by the Hohokam,
and legislators argued over which town would be the capital of Arizona
Territory (Prescott won). A major influx of cattle and their minders was
followed in the 1880s by the arrival of the railroad, which made shipping
both cows and copper far more efficient.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Arizona 21

Dams, A/C, and microchips
Impressed by the 1911 debut of the Theodore Roosevelt Dam, which
showed that it was possible to get water into the desert, the U.S. govern-
ment made Arizona a state the following year. Over the next decades,
Arizona continued to divert water for electrical and recreational pur-
poses; Glen Canyon Dam and its offshoot, Lake Powell, are prime exam-
ples. Cotton became more popular, industrially speaking, than beef, and
cattle ranches gave way to dude ranches and, eventually, resorts.
Desert combat training centers established during World War II inspired
many servicemen to return to sunny Arizona after the conflict ended;
the advent of air-conditioning in the 1950s clinched the deal. Motorola,
Honeywell, McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing), and Hughes (now
Raytheon) liked the (business) climate, too, and in the 1970s and 1980s,
most of the copper mines closed. With computer chips replacing cow
chips and good weather replacing subterranean treasure as incentives
to come to Arizona, the transition from Old West territory to Sunbelt
state was accomplished by the end of the 20th century.

hot-button political issue.
Building Blocks: Local Architecture
The prototypes for many of the state’s Southwestern-style structures 
lie north, at such archaeological sites as Wupatki, Navajo National
Monument, Canyon de Chelly, and at the Hopi mesas, where you find tra-
ditional Native American pueblos, flat-roofed, multistory adobe homes
with ceilings made of heavy timbers (vigas) that protrude from the
buildings’ sides. But it took neighboring New Mexico, also home to many
pueblos, to capitalize on American Indian architecture in what has come
to be known as Santa Fe style, a style eventually imported to Arizona.
In addition to the original Native American pueblos (and the impressive
hunting lodge–style structures that cropped during the turn of the 20th
century; the Grand Canyon hotels are prime examples), you’re most
likely to come across the building types discussed in the following sec-
tions (although rarely in pure form; eclecticism is probably the most
consistent element of Arizona’s architecture).
The chronological list in the following sections omits the modernist
style of Frank Lloyd Wright. Even though the architect built his influen-
tial Taliesin West in Scottsdale (see Chapter 11), Wright’s organic-form
aesthetic had its roots not in the Southwest but in the Midwest.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Arizona 23

Spanish colonial
The Spanish adapted many elements of the pueblos into their homes —
as well as earlier Moorish influences — when they arrived in the new
world, but retained their old-world architectural ways in the mission
churches they built. The ultrabaroque mujedar style, with its domed
roofs, inverted pyramids, and ornate plastered masonry, is exemplified
at Mission San Xavier del Bac near Tucson (see Chapter 13), built
between 1783 and 1797.
Sonoran
These modest, simple structures, characterized by thick adobe walls
shared with the dwelling next door, small windows, flat roofs with drain-
pipes called canales, and ceilings that cross-hatch saguaro ribs with
heavier timbers, were designed to offer shade to pedestrians strolling
by. The Sonoran style, which arose in the 1850s, was particularly preva-
lent in Tucson — for example, the Edward Nye Fish House, part of the
Tucson Museum of Art and Historic Block (see Chapter 13).
Territorial
Blending such traditional Sonoran features as clean lines and shared
adobe walls with popular Greek Revival elements like wood trim, pedi-
ments, shutters, and pitched roofs covered in corrugated tin, this archi-
tectural style developed and flourished during Arizona’s Territorial
period (1863–1912), especially after the advent of the railroad. The store-
fronts of Tombstone, popularized in Old West film sets, are one version
of this style. Other examples of Territorial architecture can be found in
the towns of Tubac and Florence, and particularly in Prescott, Arizona’s
territorial capital.
Pueblo Revival or Santa Fe
This blend of Pueblo, Spanish, and Territorial styles that arose in New
Mexico in the early 20th century is more evident today in Arizona’s expen-
sive homes (and in many of Sedona’s celebrated bed-and-breakfasts) than
in its public buildings. Characteristic features include rounded corners,
protruding vigas (ceiling beams), flat roofs, thick walls suggestive of
adobe, and exteriors of earth-colored stucco. Architect Mary Colter’s Hopi
House and the Watchtower at the South Rim of the Grand Canyon may be
considered Pueblo Revival style, except that these buildings stem from
Colter’s attempt to re-create American Indian pueblos rather than adapt
them to Anglo tastes.
Spanish Colonial Revival
The arches, stucco walls, patios, and courtyards identified with this
style gained popularity in the 1920s. Related styles — Monterey,
Mediterranean, and California Mission Revival, all imports from
Part I: Introducing Arizona 
24

California — add the red-clay tile roofs that are ubiquitous in Arizona
housing complexes. The main building of the Heard Museum in Phoenix
(see Chapter 11), built in 1929, is a prime example of Spanish Colonial
Revival architecture.
Taste of Arizona: Local Cuisine
Arizona borders the northern Mexican state of Sonora, where beef is big,
chiles aren’t typically incendiary, and cheese is used liberally. Most of
the Mexican food in Arizona’s dining rooms fits this style, although you
can find those that stray from it.
New Southwestern cuisine — so termed by chefs in order to distinguish
it from the plainer Mexican and cowboy fare folks associate with the old
Southwest — is known for its use of local ingredients like blue corn and
(deprickled) cactus pads, its creative mélange of cooking styles, and its
visually stimulating presentations.
On the opposite end of the spectrum is the food of Native America, which
tends to marry nicely with Mexican cuisine. This fare tends to be heavy
(one of its staples is fry bread, which is exactly what it sounds like) but
can also produce something as light and flaky as piki bread, made with
blue cornmeal. Cornmeal is a product of the New World staple corn,
which also figures heavily in the cuisine.
For additional details on what you’re likely to find on your plate in this
state, see Chapter 21.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Arizona 25
It’s not a style, it’s a building material
You’re likely to come across buildings in Arizona described as “adobe style.” That’s
the equivalent of calling a Georgian home a “brick style” structure — completely
meaningless. Like brick, adobe is a building material, specifically, a mix of earth, water,
and straw left to dry in the sun. The original Native American adobe blocks were
shaped by hand; the Spanish introduced wooden molds to standardize the forms. To
keep them from melting in the rain or crumbling back to their natural state, adobe
structures were covered with nonpermeable plaster, whitewash, or cement stucco.
Early Arizona settlers used adobe because it was easy to make and because the thick
walls it produced kept homes cool in summer and warm in winter. For the eco-
conscious, construction with adobe — along with its cousins, straw bale and rammed
earth — has made a comeback. Many like the soft lines and slight irregularities that
the building material imparts, while others (generally of the New Age persuasion)
believe that adobe brings to its users a spiritual connection with the earth.

Word to the Wise: The Local Lingo
Passing for an Arizonan doesn’t involve toning down that New Jersey 
or Louisiana accent; practically everyone who lives in the state is from
somewhere else, anyway. You just need to master a bit of the lingo and
determine which phrases and buzzwords can quickly blow your cover as
a Zonie wannabe.
Speak a little Español
You hear and see plenty of Spanish in Arizona. Remember that the con-
quistadors, not the pilgrims, were the first real estate developers in these
parts. (See the “History 101: The Main Events” section at the beginning of
this chapter.) Arizona comes by its Iberian pretensions honestly.
Take street names, for example. Everything’s “Cañon del Oro” (canyon of
gold) this or “Via Linda” (pretty road) that — even if no canyon of gold
exists within a hundred miles of the spot or if the road couldn’t be less
beautiful. Homes that no self-respecting horse would approach are often
called “ranchos.” (In fact, if you’re acquainted with Spanish, you proba-
bly find the housing development dialect pretty amusing.)
On the other hand, Mexican-menu Spanish is not at all silly; it’s extremely
helpful, especially when it comes to getting fed throughout the state. See
Chapter 21 for details.
In general, if a word seems to be of Spanish origin, watch your j’s (some-
times pronounced h if at the beginning of a word, as in javelina [hav-uh-
lee-nuh]); g’s (sometimes pronounced like h, as in Gila monster [hee-la]);
and n’s that have funny squiggly things called tildes on top of them
(always pronounced nyuh, as in the aforementioned Cañon del Oro
[ca-nyuh-on del or-o]).
Never ask, “Where are the trees?”
Everyone knows that the real trees are in northern Arizona, decorating
the area near the Grand Canyon (Mother Nature must have thought that
big ol’ hole needed a little softening around the edges) or on top of
mountains. You will quickly deduce that most of southern Arizona’s
plants (read: cacti) are unapproachable, after the hundredth time you’ve
had to remove them from your person and clothing with tweezers if you
got too close.
Do chant, “But it’s a dry heat”
Everyone in southern Arizona becomes a pseudo-Buddhist in the hotter
months, when this phrase is uttered continuously as a mantra.
Part I: Introducing Arizona 
26

Never say, “I’m looking for a shaded parking spot”
Oh, there’s plenty of parking space, but shaded parking spots are as rare
as hens’ teeth. It just goes to show that Arizonans have more space than
sense.
Never be put out if you’re called a “Zonie”
Congratulations. You’re not being accused of being a member of a cult;
rather, you’re accepted — and only slightly insulted — as an Arizonan.
“Zonie” is probably one of the fonder names that Californians call resi-
dents of their next-door-neighbor state, partly because Arizonans tend
to descend on cooler California en masse every summer.
Don’t slip on slickrock
Unless you’re a klutz who slips on everything, slickrock isn’t slick,
although it is bare of plants. The strikingly beautiful, eroded, rust-
orange-and-buff sandstone of northern Arizona’s Colorado Plateau got
its name because it’s often covered with a slightly shiny desert varnish
(which isn’t actually varnish but, rather, a thin blue-black veneer formed
by seeping water, wind, and a variety of microbes). Slickrock served as
the original Etch-a-Sketch for Native American artists, who pecked or
scratched their designs onto the dark surface to reveal the lighter rock
below (creating what are now called petroglyphs).
Background Check: Recommended 
Movies and Books
Get in the proper mood for your trip by checking out the following
Arizona-centric movies and books.
Films
Arizona and the cinematic myth of the West found their apotheosis in
Monument Valley, where John Wayne and director John Ford worked
together on Stagecoach (1938), She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949), and The
Searchers (1956). Old Tucson Studios — built in 1939 for the filming of
Arizona, starring William Holden — was no slouch in the Western movie
legends department, either. Classic shoot-’em-ups that came out of the
studios include Rio Lobo (1970), also starring John Wayne; Hombre
(1966) with Paul Newman (1966); and The Gunfight at the O.K. Corral
(1957), featuring Kirk Douglas. In a more humorous Western vein, Old
Tucson Studios also produced McClintock (John Wayne, 1962) and Three
Amigos! (Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, Martin Short, 1986). B westerns too
numerous to list were shot around the rest of the state, especially in
Sedona. For more detail, check out John A. Murray’s Cinema Southwest:
An Illustrated Guide to the Movies and Their Locations (Northland, 2000).
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Arizona 27

Me? I like Westerns mainly for the good-looking guys in tight jeans — the
1994 Tombstone with Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer stands out in that cate-
gory — but my favorite Arizona movies tend to be of the chick-flick vari-
ety: Boys on the Side (1994), filmed in Tucson and Tumacácori; Tin Cup
(1995), shot in Tucson and Tubac; Waiting to Exhale (1995), panning
across lots of Phoenix posh spots; and Thelma and Louise (1991) (do I
care that Dead Horse Point in Utah stood in for the Grand Canyon at the
end? Not a bit). I’m also fond of the goofy Harvey Girls (1946) because 
it highlights an interesting aspect of Arizona history and stars Angela
Lansbury and Judy Garland (plus, I always find myself humming “On the
Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe” afterward). Finally, there’s the Coen
brothers’ unclassifiable Raising Arizona (1987), with lots of good shots of
a less-developed Scottsdale, and of a young and very funny Nicholas Cage.
On the small screen, the Valley of the Sun gets a star turn with NBC’s
“Medium,” featuring a police department–advising psychic. The title
character, played by Patricia Arquette, is based on Phoenix-dwelling psy-
chic Allison DuBois. That the show’s action remained in Arizona rather
than being shifted to Los Angeles or New York is spooky indeed.
Books
I’m not going to pretend to be even close to comprehensive here. The
following is a very eclectic, somewhat quirky cross-sampling from my
bookshelves, including volumes that I found useful in researching this
guide and ones that I just enjoyed reading. In the latter category — but
otherwise hard to typecast — is the cautionary The Edge: Death in Grand
Canyon, by Michael P. Ghiglieri and Thomas M. Myers (Puma Press; 2001).
The book provides lots of horrified amusement as well as a sense of supe-
riority (“I would never do anything as dumb as that,” you assure yourself
constantly).
On (and off) the road
If you like learning-as-you drive (well, as another person drives) guides, 
I recommend Travel Arizona: The Back Roads (Arizona Highway Press,
1999), by James Cook, Sam Negri, and Marshall Trimble, an illustrated
volume focusing on the state’s scenic byways. In addition to a road-
marker-by-road-marker rundown of the sights, Fran Kusik’s Native Roads:
The Complete Motoring Guide to the Navajo and Hopi Nation (Treasure
Chest, 1999) gives practical advice about visiting the reservations. If
rocks rock your boat, you’ll enjoy the Roadside Geology of Arizona by
Halka Chronic (Mountain Press, 1983). Wonder about stuff like how
Misery Fort got its name? Arizona Place Names by Will C. Barnes
(University of Arizona Press, 1988) is for you. When you’re ready to
leave your car behind for a while, you’ll find Scott S. Warren’s 100 Hikes
in Arizona (The Mountaineers, 1994) very useful.

swimming pool, and grassy golf course you see in the state. Alex
Shoumatoff’s Legends of the American Desert: Sojourns in the Greater
Southwest (HarperPerennial, 1997) personalizes the exotic appeal of 
the region.
History
Environmental historian Stephen J. Pyne highlights the showcasing of the
abyss in How the Canyon Became Grand: A Short History (Viking, 1998). In
the richly illustrated Inventing the Southwest: The Fred Harvey Company
and Native American Art (Northland, 1996), authors Kathleen L. Howard
and Diana F. Pardue demonstrate how the Fred Harvey Company directed
both Arizona’s tourist history and Native American art. For a more gen-
eral, and folksier, take on the state’s past, try Marshall Trimble’s Arizona:
A Cavalcade of History (Treasure Chest, 1989).
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Arizona 29
Murder on the Grand Canyon Express
When I travel, I really enjoy reading mysteries set in the locales that I visit (I take it on
faith that I won’t come across any actual bodies). For northeast Arizona, you can’t do
better than Tony Hillerman, whose fictional detectives, Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn,
are Navajo and whose books are largely set on the “rez.” If you visit southeast Arizona,
try the J.A. Jance series, which features Joanna Barnes as the sheriff of Bisbee (for
example, Skeleton Canyon). Most of Jake Page’s books are set in and around Santa
Fe, New Mexico, but The Stolen Gods uses the Hopi reservation and Tucson as its
prime locations. I’d put Linda Lael Miller’s trilogy, One Last Look, Don’t Look Now, and
Never Look Back, which take place in and around Phoenix; and Sinclair Browning’s
thrillers, featuring a cowgirl-Apache detective who lives in the Tucson area (for exam-
ple, Tragedy Ann), a rung below the others, but they’re still great for soaking in some
local color. 
Several of these authors are also available in audiobook versions from either Books
on Tape (% 800-88-BOOKS; www.booksontape.com) or Recorded Books, LLC
(% 800-638-1304; www.recordedbooks.com). You can borrow them for free from
many local libraries or, if you can’t find them near you, order them directly from the
companies. I especially recommend taking Hillerman tapes along with you if you’re
going to northeast Arizona. Listening to the books makes the longer legs of the trip zip
by — and actually viewing the places Hillerman describes is a kick.

My top picks for books on recent history are memoirs by a couple of pio-
neering women. Lazy B: Growing Up on a Cattle Ranch in the American
Southwest, by Sandra Day O’Connor (Random House, 2002), shows how
life on the remote Arizona/New Mexico border helped prepare the author
for challenges like becoming the first female justice of the Supreme Court.
The Human Experiment: Two Years and Twenty Minutes Inside Biosphere 2,
by Jane Poynter (Thunder’s Mouth, 2006), is the first-hand tale of being
sealed into the famous giant terrarium. One of eight members of the origi-
nal “crew,” the author brings humor to what doubles as a cautionary tale
about Biosphere 1 — our planet.

I
’m not going to try to fool you. I don’t cover every inch of Arizona in
this book. That would require a volume twice this size and half as
useful. Besides, who has that much time? Instead, I select the top cities
(luckily, Arizona only has two) and regions. Within these locations, I
cover the best attractions and events Arizona has to offer. After you look
it over, it’s up to you to decide where you want to go and how to shape a
vacation that’s right for you.
Going Everywhere You Want to Be
Arizona offers you both big-city pleasures and real wilderness adven-
tures. The following sections focus on destinations that offer the best
sightseeing, attractions, and events in the state.
Introducing the cities
Be prepared: Arizona’s major urban areas are not the compact, strollable
spaces that most travelers associate with the term city. Both Phoenix
and Tucson came of age when the United States was romancing the auto,
and their original historic centers didn’t hold. Take these two sprawling
Sonoran Desert metropolises for what they are — the (heat) waves of
the future. Incidentally, although Tucson is farther south than Phoenix,
the temperature is generally about 5 degrees cooler, because its 2,100-
foot elevation is 1,000 feet higher than Phoenix’s and because it has less
heat-retaining concrete.

The Valley of the Sun (also known as Greater Phoenix)
Arizona’s largest, most populous city is actually a vast metropolitan
complex. Phoenix, the state capital, and Scottsdale are its two best-
known components. Growing rapidly and adding great restaurants, shop-
ping centers, and resorts, but subtracting desert terrain, the Valley is
quintessentially New West. Side trips from the Valley explore a far more
pristine landscape (the Apache Trail), and take you to America’s one-
time dude ranch capital (Wickenburg).
Tucson
The state’s second city is first in terms of history and culture. Established
almost a century earlier than Phoenix, Tucson still has Old West and
Spanish character. The city also has more protected land, including a
national park devoted to cacti (Saguaro National Park). But urbanization
has crept in here as well. Unbridled growth adds leisure amenities while
diminishing natural beauty. Side trips from Tucson lead to an observatory
(Kitt Peak), more cacti (Organ Pipe), and one of the earliest established
Native American historical sites (Casa Grande), which may have been an
observatory, too.
Dividing the regions
The east central and far southwestern portions of the state have their
appeal but don’t significantly add to a first-time visitor’s experience. You
can break down the state’s remaining areas into the following prime tour-
ing regions. The following sections start from the south.
The Southeast
The region southeast of Tucson has everything: Old West color, includ-
ing the town of Tombstone and several remote guest ranches; venerable
Spanish missions and new wineries; outdoor activities, from horseback
riding to bird-watching; the state’s latest underground attraction,
Kartchner Caverns; and shopping down Mexico way.
Central
The up-and-down area northwest of Phoenix is renowned for its red rocks
and granite dells. The area’s two main towns are Sedona, which vies with
Scottsdale for the state’s “ritziest little town” title; and Prescott, the one-
time territorial capital, rich with Victoriana. Near Sedona, the Verde Valley
offers a lively ghost town, a great train ride, and two well-preserved Indian
ruins.
Grand Canyon and the Northwest
The Grand Canyon speaks for itself, but the rest of the northwest area
may surprise you. For example, Flagstaff, Arizona’s third-largest city, has
a kickback college-town charm. Nearby, you can visit ancient dwellings
that were left behind in a land that was ravaged by, and then fertilized
by, some not-so-ancient volcanoes.

Arizona Cities and Regions
Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 33
The Northeast: Hopi and Navajo Country
One of Arizona’s most remote and intriguing regions encompasses land-
scapes that define the Southwest, including Monument Valley, Canyon de
Chelly, and Petrified National Forest; the native cultures of the Navajo
and the Hopi that keep its spiritual heart beating; splashy attractions
like Lake Powell; and the kicky, kitschy Route 66.

Scheduling Your Time
If you’re from a smaller, more urban-centric state, you may be tempted
to plan a trip to Arizona based on more familiar travel experiences.
Throw out those East Coast and Midwest touring models; they don’t
apply to the Southwest. Instead, wIhen devising your Arizona adventure,
keep in mind the rules discussed in the following sections.
More is less
Arizona is so large that, unless you have unlimited vacation time, you
have to decide in advance which region(s) you plan to visit. Otherwise,
you’ll literally be spinning your wheels (see the following “Wheels win”
section). Naturally, your specific choices depend on your interests and
the time of year you travel. The information in the “Going Everywhere
You Want to Be” section at the beginning of this chapter and in the
“Revealing the Secrets of the Seasons” section later in this chapter
should help you personalize an itinerary. In addition, Chapter 4 offers
some sample itineraries that you can use or adapt.
Remember, too, that you can have too much of a good thing. Try to 
vary your terrain — literally and figuratively. For example, if you like 
the great outdoors, you’ll be wowed by southern Arizona’s cactus-laden
landscape — but you don’t need to go to Saguaro National Park in Tucson,
take a side trip from Tucson to Organ Pipe National Monument, and then
go to the Desert Botanical Gardens in Phoenix, all of which would leave
you with no time to view the red rocks of Sedona or the strangely poised
boulders of Chiricahua National Monument. Similarly, unless you’re on a
scholarly research mission, you can pass up the smaller museums of
Native American culture if you’ve visited the Heard Museum in Phoenix. 
In fact, you don’t really need to spend time in both Greater Phoenix and
Tucson. The cities are sufficiently similar in their amenities and attrac-
tions that you won’t gain much by dividing your time between them.
Because distances between Arizona’s tourist attractions are so great,
basing yourself in either major city may not be your best move. You
wouldn’t want to bed down in Phoenix, for example, and drive to the
Grand Canyon and back in a single day. Getting away from the large
metro areas and staying at smaller regional hotels or inns is fun — and
often less expensive. On the other hand, if you want to relax in one
place, Greater Phoenix and Tucson provide plenty for you to do. You can
easily spend a week in either place and take some great side trips. You
won’t be bored, I promise.
Wheels win
Arizona is public transportation–challenged, so if you don’t plan on driv-
ing, you either have to rely on escorted tours or spend huge amounts of
time and/or money trying to get around independently. Yes, the major
cities have bus systems, but they’re slow and won’t necessarily take you
where you want to go; moreover, most bus lines shut down at ridiculously
Part I: Introducing Arizona 
34

early hours. So, for example, if you didn’t have a car and wanted to go out
to dinner in most parts of Greater Phoenix, you’d have to phone in
advance for a cab in both directions — and pay through the nose.
One exception to the you-can’t-get-there-without-your-own-wheels rule is
visiting the Grand Canyon, a site so popular that the state goes out of its
way to transport people to it. You can catch a shuttle from Phoenix to
Flagstaff — which, being a smallish college town, has a pretty decent bus
system and a nice strollable downtown — then take another shuttle from
Flag to the abyss, where, especially in summer, going carless is an asset.
Phoenix rising (and landing)
Don’t assume that all parts of Arizona are equally accessible by air. You
can fly directly into Tucson from some places — and, if you want to
spend your time in that city and/or in southeast Arizona, I suggest you
look into that option — but most airlines offer far more flights, espe-
cially economical ones, into Phoenix. Before spending time devising a
vacation itinerary, check out flights to Arizona from your hometown. If
all signs point to Phoenix, as is likely, plan your itinerary accordingly.
Of course, if you’re driving into Arizona, ignore all of the preceding
advice. You’re probably already distance- and transportation-savvy.
Revealing the Secrets of the Seasons
Because of Arizona’s size and its varied topography, vacationing in the
northern part of the state on the Colorado Plateau is a completely differ-
ent experience from touring the Sonoran Desert in the south. Because of
the great temperature and altitude variations, the state’s two sections
are practically mirror opposites of each other — meaning Arizona
always has great weather somewhere.
What is central Arizona’s climate? Of the two main towns covered in
Chapter 16, Sedona tends to be a bit cooler than southern Arizona, but
not as cool as Prescott, whose weather more closely resembles that of
Flagstaff’s high desert. Tables 3-1 and 3-2 give you a month-by-month
breakdown of average temperatures and rainfall for Phoenix and
Flagstaff, respectively.

Southern Arizona
If you’re like me and don’t mind the heat — but, honey, when southern
Arizona is hot, it’s hot — you won’t find a bad time of the year to visit.
Spring — when the mercury hasn’t peaked, but room prices have — 
is prime. Unless the winter’s unusually dry, the desert blooms with 
wildflowers.
Winter
Winter is wonderful because . . .
 The weather’s glorious — sunny and warm — and perfect for sight-
seeing and anything else you want to do.
 Everything’s happening: events, festivals, music, and theater pro-
grams, you name it.
But keep in mind that . . .
 Room prices are at their highest.
 Crowds are at their largest, which means lots of traffic, too.
Spring
Spring is special because . . .
 The desert is usually a flowering wonderland.
 Room rates start to dip.
But keep in mind that . . .
 Temperatures begin to creep up; some days may be uncomfortably
warm, and you may enjoy better weather in your hometown.
 Prices aren’t as low as they’re going to be in a few months.
Summer
Summer sizzles because . . .
 You can try the resort of your dreams for rock-bottom rates, and
fancy restaurants run summer specials.
 The streets are uncrowded, thanks to the departure of students
and snowbirds (long-term winter visitors).
But keep in mind that . . .
 The sizzling is literal.
 Desert tours, hikes, and other activities slow or cease; many restau-
rants in the southeast close when their owners head for the hills.
Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 37

Fall
Fall is fabulous because . . .
 The room rates are still fairly low.
 Activities like concerts and shows come back on track.
But keep in mind that . . .
 It takes a while to cure that heat hangover; temperatures may still
be uncomfortable.
 The University of Arizona and Arizona State University freshmen
are beginners at driving around the streets of Tucson and Greater
Phoenix.
Northern Arizona
Northern Arizona doesn’t have any loser seasons — even the cold isn’t
very cold. The fall is prime because the crowds thin and the weather’s
crisp and comfortable. Stay away from the Grand Canyon in summer,
though, unless you prefer to bond with a few thousand of your fellow
human beings rather than with nature alone.
Summer
Summer sizzles because . . .
 The weather is great: sunny, warm, and clear.
 Everything’s open and happening.
But keep in mind that . . .
 Everyone wants to visit in summer; the Grand Canyon is a zoo.
 The room rates are as high as the sun in the sky.
Fall
Fall is fabulous because . . .
 The crowds go back to school and work.
 The weather’s still sunny and an actual autumn season begins with
colorful leaves and all.
But keep in mind that . . .
 Many places begin observing shorter hours; some facilities start to
close.
 The rates aren’t at their lowest yet.
Part I: Introducing Arizona 
38

Winter
Winter is wonderful because . . .
 No scenery is prettier than the snow against the Grand Canyon
(and Flagstaff is a winter sports mecca). Even if no snow is on the
ground, the weather is crisp and clear.
 The room rates — and the crowds — bottom out; you enjoy your
pick of lodgings.
But keep in mind that . . .
 The Grand Canyon’s North Rim is closed, and you can’t swim in
Lake Powell without freezing your patooties off.
 Fewer services are offered than at any other time of year.
Spring
Spring is special because . . .
 Facilities reopen, but the crowds aren’t present.
 The weather warms up.
But keep in mind that . . .
 Mother Nature is erratic; snow may fall, the roads may close, and
the temperature’s still not warm enough to dip into Lake Powell.
 The rates begin to warm up, too.
Checking Out the Calendar of Events
In addition to the typical U.S. holiday festivities and the events listed in
the following sections, expect celebrations in southern Arizona for Cinco
de Mayo (May 5), commemorating Mexico’s victory over the French in
an 1862 battle, and, to a lesser extent, for the El Dia de los Muertos (or
All Soul’s Day), November 2. Christmas in the southern part of the state
also has a Mexican accent, with luminarias (candles in small paper bags)
lighting the paths to many churches and homes.

Chapter 4
Following an Itinerary: 
Five Great Options
In This Chapter
 Seeing Arizona’s southern hot spots
 Traveling to northern Arizona’s high (and low) points
 Mixing it up with a great Arizona combination plate
 Discovering Arizona for youngsters (and youngsters-at-heart)
 Mining the best of Arizona’s Old West
You may already know exactly what you want to do in Arizona — park
yourself at a Scottsdale resort and get spa treatments for the first
week of your vacation and go white-water rafting on the Colorado River
during the second week. But, if you’re like most people, you may not have
decided what you want out of your Arizona vacation, especially when
faced with the terrific array of vacation opportunities. In this chapter, I
present itineraries to help you hit the highlights — and forgo the rest.
For all these itineraries, I assume you’re flying into Sky Harbor Airport 
in Phoenix, which has the greatest number of flights in the state (see
Chapter 6 for information on which carriers fly to Phoenix). In addition, 
I assume that you’re renting a car (see Chapter 7 for the lowdown on
how to do that), which is really, the best way to tour the state.
Going North or South: Seeing Arizona’s
Highlights in One Week
Because you can’t do the entire state in a single week — you just get
super stressed if you try — I propose two weeklong “Greatest Hits” itiner-
aries, one for the northern half of the state and one for the southern part.
But which should you choose? Look at the information on Arizona’s sea-
sons in Chapter 3. If you’re interested in beating the crowds and keeping
your costs down, try the northern Arizona itinerary in winter or the
southern Arizona itinerary in summer. If you’re dying for a winter get-
away to a warm place and money isn’t the main issue, go to southern
Arizona in winter and . . . well, you get the picture.

Swinging through southern Arizona
Because the distances between attractions aren’t as great as in the
northern part of the state, during a one-week tour of the south you may
even be able to fit in a little pool time. But you are still on the move. Part
of the allure of southern Arizona is kicking back at a resort or a dude
ranch, but if you follow my proposed schedule, you’re not going to get
much bang for your buck from these lodgings. If you opt for this itiner-
ary, choose economical or historic digs, not ones with tons of built-in
activities.
Assuming you’re not completely wiped out on Day 1 when you arrive in
Phoenix, spend the afternoon exploring Old Scottsdale’s historic build-
ings and boutiques and visiting the Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary
Art. If you’re more interested in architecture than shops or contempo-
rary art, head for Taliesin West, Frank Lloyd Wright’s home and architec-
ture school. (For information on all these sights, see Chapter 11.) In the
evening, enjoy dinner at a Western steakhouse or a low-key Mexican
restaurant.
Spend Day 2 following the one-day Phoenix itinerary in Chapter 11 —
but skip the Desert Botanical Gardens. You’ll see plenty of cacti in
Tucson during the next two or three days.
On Day 3, take the slow, scenic back route (Highway 87/287 to Highway
79 to Highway 77) down to Tucson, stopping at the Casa Grande Ruins
National Monument, with its mysterious Hohokam structures. Have
lunch in the nearby town of Florence, which has the greatest number of
homes on the National Historic Register — and the most prisons — in
Arizona. (See Chapter 14 for information on both places.) Explore muse-
ums and historic homes in town, then head down to your Tucson hotel
and eat dinner nearby; you may want to turn in early to prepare for a
jam-packed Day 4.
On Day 4, follow the one-day itinerary for Tucson outlined in Chapter 13.
On Day 5, drive south from Tucson along I-19. Choose between the Titan
Missile Museum, where you can descend into the former control center
of a nuclear warhead, and the town of Tubac, with its historic fortress
and myriad crafts shops. By choosing either the museum or a tour of
Tubac, you may have time to stop at the moody, ruined mission at
Tumacácori National Historical Park and get down to Nogales, Mexico,
for lunch. Do a bit of bargaining and cross back over the border. Then
take Highway 82 northeast to the sleepy one-time ranching town of
Patagonia. If you’re not shopped out, browse a few more crafts bou-
tiques. Spend the night in Patagonia or in nearby Sonoita, which is even
smaller — both have interesting lodgings and good restaurants, plus at
least one cowboy bar. (See Chapter 15 for information on the attractions
in this paragraph.)
Divide Day 6 between Bisbee, a Victorian-style mining town, and
Tombstone (yes, that one, famous for the shootout at the OK Corral).
Part I: Introducing Arizona 
44

The towns aren’t far from each other so you can visit both in a day.
You’re best off bedding down in Bisbee, which has more lodging and
dinner options (See Chapter 15 for information on both towns.)
Spend the morning of Day 7 trekking among the strangely balanced boul-
ders at Chiricahua National Monument. To get to the monument from
Tombstone, take Highway 80 to I-10; then go east to Highway 186 south.
From Bisbee, take Highway 90 east to Highway 191 north, and then go
east on Highway 181. Head out early if you want to catch the daily hiking
shuttle at 8:30 a.m. Enjoy a piece of apple pie for lunch in Willcox (you’ve
earned it after all that exercise), and then visit the Rex Allen Arizona
Cowboy Museum and Theater. In the afternoon, descend into Kartchner
Caverns State Park near Benson, which puts you back on I-10 and in a
position to zip back to Tucson where you can spend your last night if you
don’t have an early plane out the next day, or to Phoenix, if you do. (See
Chapter 15 for the attractions mentioned in this paragraph. Note that you
need to book tickets in advance for Kartchner Caverns.)
Traveling around northern Arizona
Pick up your rental car at the Phoenix airport on Day 1 and hit the 
road — I-17, that is — heading north. If you arrive reasonably early 
in the afternoon, stop for a half hour at the Indian cliff dwellings of
Montezuma Castle National Monument en route to Sedona (see
Chapter 16). Sedona is a good place to splurge on a really upscale dinner
and room. You’ll find that most of the meals and digs on the rest of the
itinerary are not as swank.
Take a gentle hike or bike around the red rocks in the morning of Day 2,
eat lunch at the lively ghost town of Jerome (see Chapter 16 for both),
and enjoy a gorgeous mid-afternoon drive along Highway 89A through
Oak Creek Canyon to Flagstaff (see Chapter 17). “Flag” is your last
chance for anything resembling nightlife, so visit a brewpub or savor a
hearty dinner, and then hit the Museum Club for some Country and
Western music.
On Day 3, take the southwestern route from Flagstaff (via Williams and
Highway 64) to the Grand Canyon’s South Rim, where you spend the
day and night. See Chapter 17 for ideas on how to organize your activi-
ties. Be sure to book a meal at El Tovar, no matter where you stay.
Leave the Grand Canyon vicinity early in the morning on Day 4 and take
the eastern route via Highway 64 out to Highway 89A, stopping at the
Cameron Trading Post (see Chapter 17) to browse the Native American
crafts — but don’t spend too long. You want to be close to Monument
Valley Navajo Tribal Park via Highway 160 to 163 by lunchtime. Eat a
Navajo taco at Goulding’s Lodge or at the visitor center’s restaurant and
tour the mesas and spires. Prepare to leave by late afternoon so that you
can arrive at Canyon de Chelly (via Highway 191 south) in time to enjoy
a leisurely dinner at the Thunderbird Lodge. (For the last four sights in
bold, see Chapter 18.)
Chapter 4: Following an Itinerary: Five Great Options 45

On the morning of Day 5, take the two Canyon de Chelly rim drives or
hike down the White House Ruin Trail. Lunch near the canyon before
heading east via Highway 191 to Highway 264 for the Hubbell Trading
Post, where you can see Navajo rugs and, if you’re lucky, catch the last
tour of trader Lorenzo Hubbell’s house. From there you have a choice:
You can either head west along Highway 264 toward the Hopi Mesas and
spend a quiet night on Second Mesa (one of the three mesas upon which
most of the Hopi villages sit) at the Hopi Cultural Center or head south
and hole up in either Holbrook or Winslow along I-40; these towns are
very close to one another. Your evening’s not going to be super exciting
in these towns, but you have more restaurant choices — and you can
enjoy a beer with dinner (the Indian reservations don’t allow alcohol). If
you opted for Holbrook/Winslow, dine at the historic La Posada hotel in
Winslow or at one of the Route 66 restaurants in Holbrook. (See Chapter
18 for the sights in this paragraph.)
If you wake up on Second Mesa on Day 6, explore the Hopi villages in
the morning. Because you already enjoyed your Nöqkwivi (lamb and
hominy stew) at the Hopi Cultural Center the night before, plan on lunch
at The Turquoise Room in Winslow or Romo’s Cafe in Holbrook. Spend
the rest of the afternoon browsing the kitschy Route 66 souvenir shops
in and around Holbrook. Alternatively, if you start your day in Holbrook
or Winslow, go to the Hopi mesas, have lunch at the Hopi Cultural
Center, and return to the Route 66 area in time for dinner in Winslow or
Holbrook. Spend the night in one of the two towns. (See Chapter 18 for
all these sights.)
On Day 7, backtrack a little bit on I-40 to the Petrified Forest National
Park (see Chapter 18), where you can spend a nice leisurely morning
and lunchtime among the dead wood. If your flight departs in the early
morning from Phoenix the next day, you want to sleep in the Valley of
the Sun. Take the scenic Highway 87 route back from Winslow to
Highway 260 to Highway 17. If you haven’t already done so on the way
up, stop at Montezuma Castle (see Chapter 16) in the late afternoon.
Enjoy a blowout farewell-to-Arizona dinner at a New Southwestern or
authentic Mexican restaurant in the Valley. Alternatively, if your flight
leaves at noon or later the following day, after a morning at the Petrified
Forest, stop at Walnut Canyon National Monument (see Chapter 17), off
I-40, before retiring for dinner in Flagstaff (which may seem like a gour-
met mecca by now). Get a good night’s sleep in Flagstaff so you’re
refreshed for your morning drive to Phoenix and the flight back home.
Taking the Leisurely Route: Touring 
the Best of Arizona in Two Weeks
Have two weeks in Arizona? Sorry, but you can’t just combine the one-
week northern and southern Arizona itineraries to get a perfect two-
week tour, because those itineraries are built around getting you back to
Part I: Introducing Arizona 
46

the Phoenix airport, which you don’t need to do in the middle of your
two-week jaunt.
Follow the southern Arizona itinerary (see the “Swinging through south-
ern Arizona” section at the beginning of this chapter) for the first six
days. On Day 7, skip the detour to Chiricahua National Monument and
Willcox and head to Prescott (Chapter 16) via I-10 to I-17 to Highway 69.
(If you can get into Kartchner Caverns in the morning or still haven’t
toured Tombstone, fine, but don’t go too far south or east.) It takes about
five hours to get from Benson to Prescott, Arizona’s one-time territorial
capital, where you can spend the night at a historic hotel or B&B. If you
need to stretch your legs en route, the Outlets at Casa Grande (off I-10)
makes a useful — if potentially expensive — walkabout (see Chapter 14).
On Day 8, travel to Jerome, and spend the rest of the afternoon and
evening in Sedona (see Chapter 16).
On the morning of Day 9, drive through Oak Creek Canyon (see
Chapter 16) on Highway 89A and turn west on I-40, before you get to
Flagstaff; then take Highway 64 north until you reach the Grand Canyon
(see Chapter 17). From there, follow the itinerary from Days 3 through 7
from the “Traveling around northern Arizona” section at the beginning
of this chapter.
Making It a Family Affair: Discovering
Arizona with Kids
This itinerary assumes that you want to get in as many top sights as pos-
sible — without pushing your family’s travel endurance to the limit — in
a single week. If you don’t feel compelled to see the Grand Canyon, you
can spend a relaxing family vacation in southern Arizona. There, you 
can divide your time between a resort with a good kids’ program in the
Valley of the Sun (the Phoenix area — see Chapter 11) and a guest ranch
in Tucson and take daily excursions to the top children’s sights in those
cities. When you stay in the Valley, visit all the attractions recommended
in the following itinerary except the Desert Botanical Gardens, because
Tucson’s Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum covers the same territory, but
better. Also, be sure your family doesn’t miss Old Tucson Studios. So,
for the state’s “greatest family hits” tour, use the following agenda.
After you arrive in Phoenix, devote the afternoon of Day 1 to just one
activity — either the Heard Museum or the Desert Botanical Garden,
and eat dinner near your hotel. Alternatively, if you don’t care about
doing anything typically Southwestern but just want to show your kids
that you aren’t in the boonies, head over to GameWorks, a two-story
family fun center at the Arizona Mills mall. Naturally, the mall has a huge
food court, too. (See Chapter 11 for the sights in this paragraph.)
Chapter 4: Following an Itinerary: Five Great Options 47

On Day 2 in Phoenix, spend the morning at the Arizona Science Center.
Chow down on a fast-food lunch at the center, and then spend the after-
noon at the Desert Botanical Garden if you haven’t already. Time per-
mitting, you can also visit the Phoenix Zoo, next door. Dine at a family
steakhouse like Pinnacle Peak Patio. (See Chapter 11 for this day’s
attractions.)
Hit the road on Day 3 by heading north on I-17. Stop off at the Deer
Valley Rock Art Center, where you can view hundreds of petroglyphs
(Native American rock art), or the Williamsburg-gone-West Pioneer
Arizona Living History Museum (see Chapter 11). Both are close to 
the Rock Springs Café and Bakery, a former stagecoach stop with lots
of kid-friendly lunch food (see Chapter 16). Get up to Clarkdale on
Highway 260 in time to board the Verde Canyon Railroad for a scenic
afternoon train ride. If you visit from Wednesday to Sunday in any month
except for January, go for the pony rides, a chuck-wagon supper, and a
Western show at the Blazin’ M Ranch in Cottonwood, which is, in any
case, a convenient and economical place to spend the night. (See
Chapter 16 for attractions in Clarkdale and Cottonwood.)
Spend Day 4 in Sedona. If the temperature is warm enough, swim at
Slide Rock State Park in the morning before the crowds descend. If the
weather is too cool for a dip, start the day with a Jeep tour, and then go
fishing at the Rainbow Trout Farm in Oak Creek in the afternoon. The
scenic drive north through Oak Creek Canyon on Highway 89A gets you
to Flagstaff, which has loads of family restaurants and inexpensive chain
hotels. (See Chapters 16 and 17 for information on Sedona and Flagstaff,
respectively.)
On Day 5, drive to the Grand Canyon’s South Rim (via I-40 and Highway
64) and spend the day and night. For suggestions on things to do at the
canyon, see Chapter 17. Alternatively, if your kids get a kick out of the
Verde Canyon train ride, consider reprising the event by using the
Grand Canyon Railway as transport. You don’t have to hassle with
parking and you can stay overnight at Williams (also in Chapter 17),
where the train depot sells railroad and forest toys (including cute
Smokey Bear replicas).
Spend Day 6 and night six back in Flagstaff, where kid-friendly attrac-
tions include the Museum of Northern Arizona, which has a dinosaur
exhibit (enough said); the Lowell Observatory, with lots of fun hands-on
science displays (better still if you come at night when the observatory
offers telescope viewing); and Snowbowl, a ski resort. If snow is on the
ground, consider some family skiing; the slopes aren’t very intimidating.
In summer, take the ski lift to the top and walk around.
On Day 7, drive east on I-40 to Meteor Crater Natural Landmark — not
quite as deep as the Grand Canyon but created a lot more quickly — and
Petrified Forest National Park, where dinosaur buffs can ogle more 
fossils (see Chapter 18 for both attractions). You can eat lunch at the
national park or in Holbrook, where the retro Route 66 diners are the
Part I: Introducing Arizona 
48

genuine items. If you’re through early enough in the afternoon, take the
scenic Highway 87 route from Winslow to Highway 260 to Highway 17.
Stop at a not-very-taxing-on-the-weary Montezuma Castle (see Chapter
16). If it’s late, or you’re all tuckered out, just drive straight east on I-40
to I-17 and zip down to Phoenix to spend the evening unwinding.
Digging In: Arizona’s Old West History
This Old West itinerary provides a close-up look at Arizona’s cowboy 
heritage and takes you around Arizona’s former mining towns. If visiting
what amounts to a few holes in the ground sounds like a yawn, think
again. Most of the famous towns of the West rose and fell around mineral
wealth. Greed, rowdiness, and, in southern Arizona, clashes with Native
Americans are the stuff of America’s legends and Hollywood Westerns.
And Arizona’s mines happen to be located in some mighty purty territory.
You can also find plenty to admire here if your interests lie above ground.
On Day 1, head straight from the Phoenix airport (via I-17 to Highway 74)
to Wickenburg (see Chapter 12), home to what was once the richest gold
mine in the state. If it’s still open, stop at the Desert Caballeros Western
Museum for some town background (and art); if not, the Jail Tree and the
Old Wishing Well never close, and you can stroll around Frontier Street,
with its intact early 1900s buildings. Have dinner at the Rancho de Los
Caballeros guest ranch or at a historic cowboy bar.
You spend a good part of Day 2 in Wickenburg. Visit the museum if you
haven’t already done so, and then drive to Robson’s Arizona Mining
World, which re-creates an old mining camp. Take a Jeep tour into the
surrounding mining territory or a self-guided tour of the Vulture Mine.
Leave the Wickenburg area by late afternoon, so you can fully enjoy the
scenery along the long, winding mountain roads (Highway 89 to 89A) up
to Jerome (see Chapter 16) for the night.
Jerome isn’t very large, but with such sights as the Jerome State
Historic Park (a one-time mine-owner’s mansion), the Jerome Historical
Society and Mine Museum, and the Gold King Mine and Ghost Town —
not to mention the streets lined with rows of crafts shops — you find
plenty to fill the morning of Day 3. In the afternoon, come down from 
the mountain to nearby Clarkdale (see Chapter 16) and ride the Verde
Canyon Railroad, which runs along tracks formerly used to haul miner-
als from Jerome (the haulers probably didn’t appreciate the stunning
vistas as much as you will). From here, drive back down along I-17 to the
Valley of the Sun (Chapter 11), where you spend the night. You don’t
find much authentic Western history there, except in Old Scottsdale,
but the area is the best jumping-off point for the next day. If you need a
break from standard American fare, here is where you find some good,
authentic Mexican food.
Chapter 4: Following an Itinerary: Five Great Options 49

You have a choice for Day 4 on how you want to approach two sights
east of Phoenix, the Apache Trail and Lost Dutchman State Park,
named for a world-famous gold mine that may never have existed. If 
you want to relax and enjoy the scenery and not drive along sometimes-
harrowing mountain roads, book a full-day tour of the Apache Trail (see
Chapter 12 for some options) and spend a second night in the Greater
Phoenix area. If you don’t mind a little adrenaline pumping, take the
Apache Trail drive described in Chapter 12, only instead of going back 
to the Valley, bunk in the town of Globe, still an active mining area.
If, on Day 5, you wake up in Globe, take the scenic route (Highway 77,
south toward I-10) and stop for lunch before you get to Tucson. You pass
plenty of casual restaurants, including the Lariat Steakhouse & Saloon
in Catalina. If you begin the day in the Phoenix area, pick up I-10 and,
before you get to downtown Tucson, detour to the Arizona – Sonora
Desert Museum, with its earth sciences center and mining display, and
lunch among the desert flora and fauna (see Chapter 13). However you
begin the day, eventually get back on I-10 and head southwest until you
reach the turnoff for Tombstone (see Chapter 15), where you can spend
the night.
On the morning of Day 6, explore Tombstone. The Tombstone
Courthouse State Historic Park is the best place to get the truth behind
the tourist hype. Next, head down to Bisbee (see Chapter 15), a mining
mecca. Not only can you take a terrific miner-led tour of the defunct
Copper Queen Mine, but you can also gaze into the great gaping
Lavender Pit Mine. The most obvious lodging choice is the Copper
Queen hotel, but several other hotels and B&Bs in town hearken back 
to Bisbee’s mining heyday.
On Day 7, take your pick of destinations. You can drive east from Bisbee
to Douglas (which once hosted the smelters for Bisbee’s mines) and
visit the historic Gadsden Hotel. Afterward, go north along Highway 191
and tour the mining ghost towns of Gleeson, Pearce, and Courtland.
Finally detour a short bit farther east on I-10 to explore the Rex Allen
Arizona Cowboy Museum and Theater in downtown Willcox (which
happens to be Arizona’s apple pie capital). Or you can head west from
Bisbee, stopping for lunch and a stroll in sleepy Patagonia (where silver
was once transported from the railroad depot). Then, if your vehicle has
good suspension, explore the ruins of Dusquesne. If you’re not up for
back-roading, pick up I-19 in Nogales and drive north to the Asarco
Mineral Discovery Center, between Green Valley and Tucson, where
you can see modern copper strip-mining in action. Either way, you end
up close to Tucson, where you spend your last night — unless you have
an early flight, in which case, you’d better hightail it back to Phoenix.
(See Chapter 15 for the attractions.)

Planning Your Trip 
to Arizona

In this part . . .
You’re Arizona bound, and you may even have an idea of
which areas of the state you want to visit and when. This
section deals with the ways to get there (with a group, on
your own, by plane, by train, and so on); your means of trans-
portation after you arrive; the types of rooms available and
the rates you can expect to pay for them; methods of dealing
with your ﬁnances while you’re on the road; and assorted
odds and ends from packing to planning for emergencies.

 Ferreting out those sneaky charges
 Cutting expenses without cutting corners
You may dislike paying for fun you’ve already had — who doesn’t? —
but if you plan ahead, you can avoid going into credit card shock
when you return from Arizona.
Planning Your Budget
To gauge how much your Arizona vacation will cost you, begin with
transportation to the airport, and then add your flight costs (see Chapter
6 for tips on how to fly for less), car rental, gas, hotel rates, meals, admis-
sion prices to attractions, and the cost of the activities you’re interested
in (golf or Jeep tours, for example). To get an idea of what things cost in
Arizona, see Tables 5-1 and 5-2. Consider the costs of souvenirs and only-
in-Arizona items. After you do all that, add on another 15 percent to 20
percent to cover tips, taxes (if they’re not included in flight or hotel
rates), and miscellaneous costs.

Transportation
To the cost of your plane ticket (see Chapter 6 for tips on getting a low
airfare), add your rental-car costs, which include the rental fee, taxes,
and approximate gas expenses. (Estimate your gas expenses as close to
departure time as possible; your guess is as good as mine as to what the
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Arizona 
54

price of gas will be when you’re traveling.) Of course, you may decide to
fly from location to location within the state, in which case transporta-
tion costs become an even larger percentage of your total trip costs.
Check out Chapter 7 for details about flying within Arizona and for ways
to keep rental-car charges down.
Lodging
The cost of your lodging really depends on the type of accommodations
you prefer — and when you’re traveling. A fancy resort in Scottsdale
during high season is going to take a huge bite out of your budget (more
than airfare, even). You pay considerably less for a stay at a chain motel
or modest B&B off-season. In general, summer is high season in north-
ern Arizona, while winter is high season in southern Arizona. See
Chapter 3 for details on both. See Chapter 8 for specifics about lodging
categories and costs.
Dining
You have a wide range of dining options in Arizona — everything from
Navajo tacos to gourmet New-Southwestern fare (for the highlights, see
Chapters 2 and 21) — and thus a wide range of dining prices. If you’re
traveling with children, you should have no problem finding plenty of
kid-friendly chains and unique Old West spots with loads of character.
In this book, I use dollar signs, ranging from $ to $$$$$, to express the rela-
tive cost of a meal for one in a restaurant (including appetizer, entree, and
dessert). Across Arizona, you can find a low-key (and low-cost) dinner,
including, in some cases, authentic Mexican food, for $12 or under per
person (the $ range). Move up to the $$ range, which runs you $25 or
under per person, and you have an even wider choice of nonchain, non-
pizza options. Outside of Greater Phoenix, Tucson, and Sedona, an
evening meal at even the most expensive restaurants shouldn’t run you
more than $50 apiece ($$$), sans that bottle of Dom Perignon champagne.
Even in the big cities, most good restaurants fall into that category. If you
want to try the real upscale joints, the domains of cutting-edge chefs, you
can expect to pay up to $75 ($$$$), and (rarely) more than $100 ($$$$$),
which still isn’t nearly as much as you’d pay for an equivalent meal in, say,
New York City, Chicago, or San Francisco.
When budgeting for meals on an American Indian reservation, you don’t
need to include the cost of alcohol, because it isn’t served.
Sightseeing
You won’t break the bank visiting Arizona’s top sights. Very few attrac-
tions in the state cost more than $10. (The Grand Canyon entry fee is $25
per vehicle, not per person, for example — and the price is good for one
week.) You also find lots of free (or close to it) stuff to do in the state.
Visiting many of the museums on the University of Arizona campus in
Tucson won’t cost you a dime, for example.
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 55

Recreation and tours, on the other hand, can take you into rough finan-
cial terrain. Greens fees are very expensive at the top resort golf courses
(as high as $250), spa treatments start at about $125 for 50 minutes, and
a hot-air-balloon adventure in Sedona runs you $195 — to name just a
few possibilities. Some activities, such as helicopter rides and Jeep
tours, are never discounted, but prices for others, such as golf, go way
down in the off season. And you can save on other items, such as spa
treatments, if you book them as part of a hotel package (see Chapter 8
for details).
Shopping
Shopping is the real wild card in your vacation budget. Big-ticket items
may include Western art and some Indian crafts. If you’ve always wanted
a Navajo rug, you won’t find a better place to buy one than in Arizona,
but they can get pricey.
Rugs aside, you can find plenty to buy in Arizona that won’t destroy
your budget — pretty tinwork candlesticks from Mexico, for example
(see Chapter 19). You can even consider a great pair of cowboy boots,
which you may ultimately get a lot of use out of (I sure do out of mine).
Nightlife
Keeping your costs down when it comes to evening activities is no prob-
lem. Phoenix and Tucson have plenty of shows and concerts to see, and
tickets won’t cost you an arm and a leg (rarely above $50 for the best
theater or ballet seats). In the same way, a couple of beers at a cowboy
bar won’t set you back a whole lot, and you can easily spend the entire
evening in the big cities enjoying dinner in a celebrated restaurant. And
gazing at all those wonderful stars up in the sky is absolutely free.
Cutting Costs — But Not the Fun
The destination chapters in Parts III and IV all include money-saving tips
specific to those places. In this section, I give you some additional gen-
eral advice — and it’s free, too (talk about bargains!).
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Arizona 
56
One-click bargain shopping
The Arizona Office of Tourism has set up a Web site to help you find bargains for every-
thing from airfare to golf, restaurants, and lodging. Log on to www.arizona
vacationvalues.com and — ka-ching! — start calculating those savings.

 Go off season. Luckily, somewhere in Arizona is always off-season.
If you visit southern Arizona in summer or northern Arizona in
winter, you can cut room costs by as much as 50 percent; prices on
activities, such as greens fees on golf courses, go way down, too.
 Travel midweek. If you can travel on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or
Thursday, you may find cheaper flights to your destination. When
you ask about airfares, see if you can get a cheaper rate by flying on
a different day. For more tips on getting a good fare, see Chapter 6.
 Check the package tours. Not many air/hotel/sightseeing bundles
exist for travelers to Arizona (see Chapter 6), but many resorts
offer special packages that may include amenities like greens fees
at their on-site courses, spa treatments, breakfast, champagne —
you name it. Always ask when you’re booking a room if the hotel
has any deals; they may just fit your interests to a tee.
 Reserve a room with a refrigerator and coffeemaker. You don’t
have to slave over a hot stove to cut a few costs; several motels
have minifridges and coffeemakers. Buying supplies for breakfast
will save you money — and probably calories.
 Invest in a cheap cooler. You’ll quickly recover the costs if you buy
large bottles of water and 12-packs of soft drinks from a grocery
store rather than buying individual drinks at more expensive road-
side convenience stores or the hotel minibar. You may even give
the cooler away to someone at the end of your trip — or to the
clerk at the car-rental company; most everyone in this state can
use an extra ice chest.
 Always ask for discount rates. Membership in AAA, frequent-flier
plans, trade unions, AARP, or other groups may qualify you for sav-
ings on car rentals, plane tickets, hotel rooms, and even meals. Ask
about everything; you may be pleasantly surprised.
 Ask if your kids can stay in the room with you. A room with two
double beds usually doesn’t cost any more than one with a queen-
size bed. And many hotels won’t charge you the additional person
rate if the additional person is pint-size and related to you. Even if
you have to pay $10 or $15 extra for a rollaway bed, you’ll save
hundreds by not taking two rooms.
 Try expensive restaurants at lunch instead of dinner. In the
Phoenix area and in Tucson, a lunch tab at a top restaurant is usu-
ally far lower than a dinner tab, even though the menu often has
many of the same specialties.
 Don’t rent a gas guzzler. Renting a smaller car is cheaper, and you
save on gas to boot. Unless you’re traveling with kids and need lots
of space, don’t go beyond the economy size.
 Cut back on the costly activities and tours. If you’re a golfer, elimi-
nate one round — or try a municipal course instead of a resort
course. If you’re the independent type, buy a book about something
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 57

you’re interested in — Old West history, say, or desert plants — and
devise a self-guided driving tour or a hike rather than paying for a
guide or something expensive such as a helicopter fly-by.
 Rein in the trinkets. As I discuss in the “Shopping” section preced-
ing this section, I wouldn’t suggest you cut out consuming alto-
gether; just be sure to plan for it and don’t bother with items you
can get anywhere, like key chains and T-shirts.
Handling Money
You’re the best judge of how much cash you feel comfortable carrying 
or what alternative form of currency is your favorite. That’s not going to
change much on your vacation to Arizona. True, you probably are moving
around more and incurring more expenses than you generally do (unless
you happen to eat out every meal when you’re at home), and you may let
your mind slip into vacation gear and not be as vigilant about your safety
as when you’re in work mode. But, those factors aside, the only type of
payment that won’t be quite as available to you away from home is your
personal checkbook.
The only parts of Arizona where the rules change slightly are on the
American Indian reservations in the northeast, where not all the crafts
vendors or tour operators take credit cards, and cash machines are
fewer and farther between. If you travel to that part of the state, you
may want to have more cash with you than in the other areas, especially
if you plan to buy crafts.
Using ATMs and carrying cash
These days, far more people use ATMs than traveler’s checks. Most
cities have handy 24-hour cash machines linked to an international net-
work that almost always includes your bank at home. Cirrus (% 800-
424-7787; www.mastercard.com) and Plus (% 800-843-7587; www.
visa.com) are the two most popular networks. Check the back of your
ATM card to see which network your bank belongs to. The toll-free num-
bers and Web sites give specific locations of ATMs where you can with-
draw money while on vacation. You can use them to withdraw just the
money you need every couple of days, which eliminates the insecurity
(and the pick-pocketing threat) of carrying around a large green stash.
Of course, many ATMs are little money managers (or dictators, depend-
ing on how you look at it), imposing limits on your spending by allowing
you to withdraw only a certain amount of money — a maximum of $200,
say — per day. Check with your bank before you leave to see if it has a
maximum daily withdrawal limit.
Using ATMs in Arizona is as safe and convenient as can be. You find cash
dispensers not only in banks, which are everywhere in the big cities, but
also in shopping malls, in late- or all-night supermarkets, and even in
bank drive-throughs. In short, the Grand Canyon state has no shortage
of places to get the green stuff.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Arizona 
58

One important reminder before you go ATM crazy, however. Many banks
now charge a fee ranging from 50¢ to $3 whenever nonaccount holders
use their ATMs. Your own bank may also assess a fee for using an ATM
that’s not one of its branch locations. In some cases, you get charged
twice just for using your bankcard when you’re on vacation. Reverting to
traveler’s checks may be cheaper (although certainly less convenient to
get a hold of and use).
How do you decide whether ATMs are for you? Call your local bank and
find out whether it has branches in Arizona. Many are represented in the
state, especially in Greater Phoenix and Tucson. Bank of America, Chase,
and Wells Fargo are particularly ubiquitous.
Doting on debit cards
Another way of working with money you have — as opposed to the theo-
retical money of credit cards — is by using a debit card (an ATM card
with a credit card logo). In many cases, your debit and ATM card are the
same piece of plastic. Instead of getting cash, however, the debit card
pays for purchases anywhere a credit card is accepted. The advantage?
The money comes out of your checking account rather than pushing up
against your credit card limit. Plus, you never pay an additional fee to
use it, and you don’t have to carry a lot of cash around.
Charging ahead with credit cards
Credit cards are a safe way to carry money, and they provide a conven-
ient record of all your travel expenses when you arrive home. The disad-
vantage, of course, is that they’re easy to overuse. Unlike ATM or debit
cards, which are directly connected to the money you have in your
checking account, credit cards can take you as far as your credit limit —
which may not bear much relation to your actual financial resources —
can go.
You can also get cash advances off your credit card at any ATM if you
know your personal identification number (PIN). If you’ve forgotten it, or
didn’t even know you had a PIN, call the phone number on the back of
your credit card, and ask the bank to send the number to you. You typi-
cally receive the number in about five to seven business days. Some banks
can give you your PIN over the phone if you tell them your mother’s
maiden name or provide some other security clearance information.
I never get a cash advance from my credit card except in emergencies.
Interest rates for cash advances are often significantly higher than rates
for credit card purchases. More important, you start paying interest on
the advance the moment you receive the cash. On airline-affiliated credit
cards, a cash advance doesn’t earn frequent-flier miles.
My personal travel strategy? I put as much money into my checking
account as I can spare before I leave and use my ATM/debit card as
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 59

much as possible. I save my credit card for planned purchases that I
know I can pay off in full.
Toting traveler’s checks
These days, traveler’s checks are less necessary because most cities
have 24-hour ATMs that allow you to withdraw small amounts of cash as
needed. However, keep in mind that you will likely be charged an ATM
withdrawal fee if the bank is not your own, so if you’re withdrawing
money every day, you may be better off with traveler’s checks — 
provided that you don’t mind showing identification every time you
want to cash one.
You can buy traveler’s checks at most banks. Most are offered in denom-
inations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and sometimes $1000. Generally, you’ll
pay a service charge ranging from 1 percent to 4 percent.
The most popular traveler’s checks are offered by the big three:
American Express (% 800-807-6233; 800-221-7282 for card holders —
this number accepts collect calls, offers service in several foreign lan-
guages, and exempts Amex gold and platinum cardholders from the 1%
fee); Visa (% 800-732-1322; AAA members can get a hold of Visa checks
for a $9.95 fee, for checks up to $1,500, at most AAA offices or by calling
866-339-3378); and, finally, MasterCard (% 800-223-9920).
If you choose to carry traveler’s checks, be sure to keep a record of their
serial numbers separate from your checks in the event that they are
stolen or lost. You’ll get a refund faster if you know the numbers.
Dealing with a Lost or Stolen Wallet
Be sure to contact all of your credit card companies the minute you dis-
cover your wallet has been lost or stolen and file a report at the nearest
police precinct. Your credit card company or insurer may require a
police report number or record of the loss. Most credit card companies
have an emergency toll-free number to call if your card is lost or stolen;
yours may be able to wire you a cash advance immediately or deliver an
emergency credit card in a day or two. Call the following emergency
numbers in the United States:
 American Express % 800-221-7282 (for cardholders and traveler’s
check holders)
 MasterCard % 800-307-7309 or 636-722-7111
 Visa % 800-847-2911 or 410-581-9994
For other credit cards, call the toll-free number directory at % 800-
555-1212.

F
iguring out how to approach your Arizona vacation is one of the
toughest — and earliest — decisions you need to make about your
trip. You may want to be totally independent, reserving your own airfare
and accommodations and plotting out your day-to-day itinerary. Or you
may prefer to seek professional help, say, by going to a travel agent, or
going on an escorted tour, where most of the decisions are made for
you. Whatever the reason you want to make your own arrangements,
this chapter supplies some basic transportation data.
Flying to Arizona
Flying in and out of Arizona couldn’t be easier — international airports
in both Phoenix and Tucson are served by numerous airlines. This sec-
tion focuses on the best strategies for booking your flight to Arizona.
Finding out which airlines fly there
You won’t have a problem flying into Arizona’s capital: Phoenix Sky
Harbor International Airport (www.phxskyharbor.com) is served by
several major and commuter airlines (Table 6-1 lists them all), with non-
stop service to and from nearly 100 cities in the United States and around
the world. Phoenix is a hub for US Airways and Southwest Airlines.
Nonstop international service is provided by AeroMexico (to and from
Mexico), British Airways (to and from London-Gatwick Airport), Air
Canada (to and from Toronto), and US Airways (to and from Calgary,
Edmonton, Toronto, Vancouver, and destinations in Mexico).
You have fewer options if you want to fly directly to Tucson International
Airport (www.tucsonairport.org). U.S. carriers serving this airport cur-
rently offer nonstop flights to only Albuquerque, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas,
Denver, Houston, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Phoenix, Salt Lake
City, San Diego, and Seattle/Tacoma.

Getting the best deal on your airfare
Competition among the major U.S. airlines is unlike that of any other
industry. Every airline offers virtually the same product (basically, a
coach seat is a coach seat is a . . .), yet prices can vary by hundreds of
dollars.
Business travelers who need the flexibility to buy their tickets at the last
minute and change their itinerary at a moment’s notice, and who want to
get home before the weekend, pay (or at least their companies pay) the
premium rate, known as the full fare. But if you can book your ticket well
in advance, stay over Saturday night, or are willing to travel on a Tuesday,
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Arizona 
62

Wednesday, or Thursday, you can qualify for the least expensive price —
usually a fraction of the full fare. On most flights, even the shortest hops
within the United States, a 7- or 14-day advance purchase ticket may cost
less than half of the full amount. Obviously, planning ahead pays.
The airlines also periodically hold sales in which they lower the prices
on their most popular routes. These fares have advance purchase
requirements and date-of-travel restrictions, but you can’t beat the
prices. As you plan your vacation, keep your eyes open for these sales,
which tend to take place in seasons of low travel volume. You almost
never see a sale around the peak summer vacation months of July and
August, or around Thanksgiving or Christmas, when many people fly,
regardless of the fare they have to pay.
Consolidators, also known as bucket shops, buy seats in bulk from the
airlines and then sell them back to the public. They’re better for interna-
tional flights than they are for domestic flights, and you usually get
better rates online.
Bucket shop tickets are usually nonrefundable or rigged with stiff cancel-
lation penalties, often as high as 50% to 75% of the ticket price, and
some put you on charter airlines with questionable safety records.
Several reliable consolidators are worldwide and available online. STA
Travel (% 800-781-4040; www.statravel.com), has been the world’s
leading consolidator for students since purchasing Council Travel, but
their fares are competitive for travelers of all ages. ELTExpress (Flights.
com) (% 800-TRAV-800; www.eltexpress.com) has excellent fares world-
wide, particularly to Europe. They also have “local” Web sites in 12
countries. Lowestfare.com (% 800-FLY-CHEAP; www.1800flycheap.
com) has especially good fares to sunny destinations. Air Tickets Direct
(% 800-778-3447; www.airticketsdirect.com) is based in Montreal
and leverages the currently weak Canadian dollar for low fares; they also
book trips to places that U.S. travel agents won’t touch, such as Cuba.
Because competition among carriers for Phoenix air space is so much
greater than for the sky above Tucson, you’re most likely to get the lowest
fares if you fly into Phoenix’s Sky Harbor airport. If you’re pressed for
time, flying directly to Tucson may be worthwhile (if, of course, Tucson is
your ultimate destination). But keep in mind that an hourly shuttle runs
from Sky Harbor to Tucson. The trip takes about two hours each way and
costs less than $60, round-trip (Chapter 13 has more info on the shuttle).
Booking your flight online
The most popular online travel agencies are Travelocity (www.
travelocity.com, or www.travelocity.co.uk); Expedia (www.
expedia.com, www.expedia.co.uk, or www.expedia.ca); and Orbitz
(www.orbitz.com). In addition, most airlines now offer online-only fares
that even their phone agents know nothing about. For the Web sites of
Chapter 6: Getting to Arizona 63

airlines that fly to and from your destination, see Table 6-1, “Airlines
That Fly into Arizona,” earlier in this chapter.

Driving to Arizona
Driving to Arizona is a fine idea if you live in the southern sections of
California, Nevada, Utah, or Colorado, or in western New Mexico — or if
you have a few weeks to spare for a major road trip. You can save money
on car-rental fees and throw everything you can possibly need into the
trunk or the back of your van. You can definitely make good connections:
I-40 runs through the state in the north, and I-10 traverses it (going
through both Phoenix and Tucson) in the south. Phoenix is 369 miles
from Los Angeles, 455 miles from Albuquerque, 660 miles from Salt Lake
City, and 287 miles from Las Vegas.
Arriving by Train
Two Amtrak (% 800-USA-RAIL; www.amtrak.com) routes service
Arizona. The Southwest Chief, which runs between Chicago and Los
Angeles, stops in Flagstaff once a day from each direction, while the
Sunset Limited from Orlando to Los Angeles stops in Tucson three days
a week in each direction. Both routes offer shuttle buses to Phoenix,
because no trains travel directly to the capital. You can tootle into
Tucson or Flagstaff and rent a car there, or even continue on to the
Grand Canyon from Flagstaff and explore the region via a bus tour (see
Chapter 7). Riding the rails isn’t the most time-effective method of
travel, nor is it necessarily the most economical, but the train is relaxing
(no need to worry about getting lost or experiencing air turbulence)
and, for many folks, it’s loads of fun.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Arizona 
64

Joining an Escorted Tour
You may be one of the many people who loves escorted tours. The tour
company takes care of the details, and tells you what to expect at each
leg of your journey. You know your costs up front and, in the case of the
tamer trips, you don’t get many surprises. Escorted tours can take you
to the maximum number of sights in the minimum amount of time with
the least amount of hassle.
If you decide to go with an escorted tour, consider buying travel insur-
ance, especially if the tour operator asks you to pay up front. But buy it
through an independent agency, not from the tour operator. You have no
reason to expect that the operator will meet his or her insurance obliga-
tions if he or she can’t even provide you with the vacation you paid for. (I
tell you more about the ins and outs of travel insurance in Chapter 10.)
When choosing an escorted tour, find out whether you have to put down
a deposit and when a final payment is due. Then ask a few simple ques-
tions before you buy:
 What is the cancellation policy? Can the operator cancel the trip 
if it doesn’t get enough people? How late can you cancel if you’re
unable to go? Do you get a refund if you cancel? If the operator 
cancels?
 How jam-packed is the schedule? Does the tour schedule try to 
fit 25 hours into a 24-hour day, or does it give you ample time to
relax by the pool or shop? If getting up at 7 a.m. every day and not
returning to your hotel until 6 or 7 p.m. at night sounds like a grind,
certain escorted tours may not be for you.
 How large is the group? The smaller the group, the less time you
spend waiting for people to get on and off the bus. Tour operators
may be evasive about the group size, because they may not know
the exact size until everybody has made reservations, but they can
give you a rough estimate.
 Does the group have a minimum size? Some tours have a mini-
mum group size and may cancel the tour if the company doesn’t
book enough people. If a quota exists, find out what it is and how
close the operator is to reaching it. Again, tour operators may be
evasive in their answers, but the information may help you select a
tour that’s sure to happen.
 What exactly is included? Don’t assume anything. You may have 
to pay to get yourself to and from the airport. A box lunch may be
included in an excursion, but drinks may be extra. Beer may be
included but not wine. How much flexibility do you have? Can you
opt out of certain activities, or does the bus leave once a day, with
no exceptions? Are all your meals planned in advance? Can you
choose your entree at dinner, or does everybody get the same
chicken cutlet?
Chapter 6: Getting to Arizona 65

Depending on your recreational passions, I recommend one of the fol-
lowing tour companies:
 Maupintour (% 800-255-4266; www.maupintour.com), which has
been in business since 1951, offers vacations for the general-interest
traveler. Maupin offers an eight-day bus package that includes the
Grand Canyon, Monument Valley, Lake Powell, Canyon de Chelly,
Sedona, and a resort in Scottsdale, among other places. The price
of $2,299 per person (based on double occupancy) includes trans-
portation between sights, guides, food, and accommodations, but
not airfare.
 GORPtravel (http://gorptravel.away.com), on the other hand,
specializes in adventure. You can choose anything from a three-day
Grand Canyon rafting trip ($925, including base-camp accommoda-
tions, equipment, local transportation, and camping meals) to a
week-long Navajo-led hiking trip around the Canyon de Chelley
($1,295). Again, airfare is extra, and you usually pay an extra fee for
single occupancy.
In addition, see Chapter 9, where I outline a few special-interest escorted
tours.
Choosing a Package Tour
For many destinations, package tours can be a smart way to go. In many
cases, a package tour that includes airfare, hotel, and transportation to
and from the airport costs less than the hotel alone on a tour you book
yourself. That’s because packages are sold in bulk to tour operators,
who resell them to the public. A package tour is kind of like buying your
vacation at a buy-in-bulk store — except the tour operator is the one
who buys the 1,000-count box of garbage bags and resells them ten at a
time at a cost that undercuts the local supermarket.
Package tours can vary as much as those garbage bags, too. Some offer
a better class of hotels than others, while some provide the same hotels
for lower prices. Some book flights on scheduled airlines; others sell
charters. In some packages, your choice of accommodations and travel
days may be limited. Some let you choose between escorted vacations
and independent vacations, while others allow you to add on just a few
excursions or escorted day-trips (also at discounted prices) without
booking an entirely escorted tour.
In Arizona, the resorts (see Chapter 8) tend to have good package deals,
often throwing in activities, such as golf and spa treatments, with the
room rates (especially during the off season). But for packages with
more variety, your best options are from airlines: US Airways Vacations
(% 800-455-0123; www.usairwaysvacations.com) has the best selec-
tion, hands down, with a wide range of departure cities, hotel/rental car
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Arizona 
66

choices, and Arizona destinations to chose from, including the Grand
Canyon, Sedona, Tucson, and the Valley of the Sun. American Airlines
Vacations (% 800-321-2121; www.aavacations.com) comes in second,
traveling to the same destinations but offering fewer hotel choices and
rental car options.
A good way to find package tours is to check the travel section of your
local Sunday newspaper and the ads in the back of national travel maga-
zines such as Travel & Leisure, National Geographic Traveler, and Condé
Nast Traveler.

S
o what’s the best way to see Arizona? That depends on your time
frame, bank account, and interests. If you want to visit just the Grand
Canyon in the north and Tucson in the south and are more strapped for
time than funds, you may want to take to the skies. If you’re like most
people, however, you want to see more, and at eye level, which brings you
to the most popular way to get around — the car. This chapter discusses
all of your major options, including traveling by car, plane, train, and bus.
By Car
Wheels are by far the best way to tool around this large state. In Arizona,
the car rules, which is why the longest section of this chapter is devoted
to roadways and the wheeling and dealing of acquiring a rental car.
Navigating highways and byways
For the most part, Arizona roads are modern and well-maintained — just
what you would expect in the wide-open Southwest. I-40 and I-10 are the
main east-west thoroughfares, traversing the northern and southern por-
tions of the state, respectively. They’re linked between Phoenix and
Flagstaff by I-17, which, despite the “I” in its name, isn’t an interstate.
The speed limit on these three arteries, all four- to six-lane divided high-
ways, is 75 mph, except on curvy stretches and around towns and cities.
Be very careful when driving through Native American lands. Not all the
livestock on the reservations are fenced in, and cows and goats often
wander out on the road. Not only is hitting an animal dangerous and
unpleasant (not to mention sad), but you also have to pay a hefty fee to
the owner for destroying private property.

In desert areas, you may be surprised to see signs reading DO NOT ENTER
WHEN FLOODED. Take them seriously. The area may be bone-dry 99 percent
of the time, but flash floods occur, well, in a flash — as do drownings of
people who drive into washes that suddenly fill up with water.
Other road hazards include dust storms, kicked up by fast-moving
winds. Pull over if the visibility is too low.
Finally, fill ’er up often. Gas stations are as many as 60 miles apart in
some places. And keep lots of extra water in your car if you’re traveling in
the desert. You don’t know when both you and your car may overheat.
Renting a car
The good news is that every car-rental company you can think of — and
some you’ve probably never heard of — is represented in Arizona, so
rates are fairly competitive. Advantage, Alamo, Avis, Budget, Courtesy,
Dollar, Enterprise, Hertz, and National (see the appendix for toll-free num-
bers and Web sites) all have rental counters in the terminals at Phoenix
Sky Harbor Airport, and several others are on the airport’s grounds.
Getting the best deal
Car rental rates vary even more than airline fares. The price depends on
the size of the car, the length of time you keep it, where and when you
pick it up and drop it off, where you take it, and a host of other factors.
Asking a few key questions may save you hundreds of dollars.
 Check whether the rate is cheaper if you pick up the car at a loca-
tion in town. Both Tucson and Phoenix add on a hefty concession
recovery fee if you rent at the airport.
 Weekend rates may be lower than weekday rates. If you’re keeping
the car five or more days, a weekly rate may be cheaper than the
daily rate. Ask whether the rate is the same for pickup Friday morn-
ing as it is Thursday night.
 Many companies assess a drop-off charge if you don’t return the
car to the same rental location; others don’t levy this fee.
 Find out whether age is an issue. Many car-rental companies add
on a fee for drivers younger than 25, while some don’t rent to them
at all.
 If you see an advertised price in your local newspaper, ask for that
specific rate; otherwise you may be charged the standard (higher)
rate. Don’t forget to mention membership in AAA, AARP, frequent-
flier programs, and trade unions. These memberships usually enti-
tle you to discounts ranging from 5 percent to 30 percent.
 Check your frequent-flier accounts. Your favorite (or at least most-
used) airline is likely to have sent you discount coupons.
Chapter 7: Getting Around Arizona 69

 As with other aspects of planning your trip, using the Internet can
make comparison shopping for a car rental much easier. You can
check rates at the major agencies’ Web sites. Plus, all the major
travel sites — Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), Expedia
(www.expedia.com), and Orbitz (www.orbitz.com), for example —
have search engines that can dig up discounted car-rental rates.
Just enter the car size you want, the pickup and return dates, and
location, and the server returns a price. You can even make the
reservation through any of these sites.
In addition to the standard rental prices, other optional charges apply to
most car rentals (and some not-so-optional charges, such as taxes). The
Collision Damage Waiver (CDW), which requires you to pay for damage
to the car in a collision, is covered by many credit card companies.
Check with your credit card company before you go, so you can avoid
paying this hefty fee (as much as $20 a day). CDWs are illegal in some
states, but not in Arizona.
The car-rental companies also offer additional liability insurance (if you
harm others in an accident), personal accident insurance (if you harm
yourself or your passengers), and personal effects insurance (if your lug-
gage is stolen from your car). Your insurance policy on your car at home
probably covers most of these unlikely occurrences. However, if your
own insurance doesn’t cover you for rentals or if you don’t have auto
insurance, definitely consider the additional coverage (ask your car-
rental agent for more information).
Some companies also offer refueling packages, in which you pay for your
initial full tank of gas up front, and can return the car with an empty gas
tank (you don’t get credit for any gas remaining in the tank). If you reject
this option, you pay only for the gas you use, but you have to return the
car with a full tank or face charges of $4 to $5 a gallon for any shortfall.
In my experience, gas prices in the refueling packages are at the high
end, so I prefer to always allow plenty of time for refueling en route to
the car-rental return.
The two most likely places to rent a car are Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport
and Tucson International Airport. Additional costs include county tax
(3.25 percent of the total in Phoenix and $3.50 per day in Tucson); city
tax (15.1 percent in Phoenix, 10.6 percent in Tucson); customer facility
fee ($4.50 per day in Phoenix, $3.50 per day in Tucson); and the afore-
mentioned concession recovery fee — the extra charge for renting at the
airport (11.11 percent in both Phoenix and Tucson).
If you plan to base yourself in either Phoenix or Tucson, renting a car at
your hotel (if such an option exists), rather than at the airport, probably
makes sense. The cost of a shuttle or cab to and from the airport may
well be less than the extra tax on your rental car. Your hotel may even
provide a free airport shuttle. If you’re planning to drive straight out of
town, however, the hassle likely won’t be worth the money you save.

By Plane
US Airways (% 800-235-9292; www.usairways.com) offers flights from
Phoenix’s Sky Harbor to Flagstaff, Lake Havasu, Page, and Tucson, while
Great Lakes Aviation (% 800-554-5111; www.greatlakesav.com) serv-
ices Page, Prescott, Sierra Vista, Kingman, and Show Low (in the White
Mountains) from Sky Harbor. Westwind Air Service (% 888-869-0866;
www.westwindairservice.com) offers departures from a smaller air-
field in Phoenix to the Grand Canyon’s South and West Rims. These are
scenic tours, and most return the same day; but you can also charter an
aircraft to go anywhere in Arizona or the Southwest.
Flying into Prescott or Flagstaff isn’t an especially time- and cost-
effective option. Neither of these fairly scenic drives takes more than
about 21⁄2 hours, and the chance of getting an air connection that saves
the time to warrant the extra expense is slim. If you’re more time- than
budget-conscious and are primarily interested in touring the Grand
Canyon’s North Rim and Native American country, I do recommend the
Phoenix-Page hop. And if you’re determined to see London Bridge in a
time pinch, you may want to fly from Sky Harbor to Lake Havasu.
By Train
Although arriving by train is fine, riding the rails isn’t a useful way to 
get around. The exception is the service to the Grand Canyon from
Williams on the Grand Canyon Railway (% 800-THE-TRAIN; www.
thetrain.com), which combines recreation with a very good means of
transportation — you get the canyon without the parking hassle. For
train schedules and fares, see Chapter 17.
By Bus
You can get to plenty of places in Arizona by bus — but you end up at a
bus station without a car. The most useful buses are the various shuttle
buses from the Phoenix airport to places where you can rent wheels,
including Tucson, Sedona, Prescott, and Flagstaff (see the “Getting
There” sections in Chapters 13, 15, and 17 for more on the shuttles).

Booking Your
Accommodations
In This Chapter
 Choosing an Arizona bunk
 Getting the best deal on your lodging
You don’t often find a state with as wide a range of accommodations
and with as many different price categories as Arizona. This chap-
ter sketches your many lodging options, and then suggests ways for you
to book them without paying top dollar.
Getting to Know Your Options
Arizona’s wide range of room types gives the traveler plenty of options.
The only types of Arizona accommodations I don’t cover in this book are
campsites — I assume you want a hard roof over your head — and youth
hostels. If you’re interested in details about where to pitch a tent or sleep
dorm-style, consult a more comprehensive guide, such as Frommer’s
Arizona (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
Also, except in B&Bs, most of which are totally nonsmoking, you can
expect hotels and resorts in Arizona to offer smoking rooms (or rooms
with balconies or patios that you can light up on).
From the highest to the lowest prices, lodgings in Arizona include the
following sections. Table 8-1 also gives a brief summation of what you
can expect in each price category. Rates are based on double occupancy
for one night during high season (see Chapter 3).

Table 8-1
Key to Hotel Dollar Signs
Dollar Sign(s)
Price Range
What to Expect
$
Less than $100
Many of the chain motels fall into this
category, especially in rural areas.
Expect decent amenities (often irons,
coffeemakers, and even high-speed
Internet) but basic decor. At historic
lodgings in this price range, rooms
tend to be small and, in some cases,
TV- or phone-less. Bathrooms will be in
the room, but the plumbing may not be
quiet.
$$
$101–$200
Mid-range chain hotels are likely to
offer more convenient locations than
those in the $ range, as well as slightly
better in-room amenities (maybe
microwaves) and outdoor recreation
facilities (a larger pool). Expect TVs
and nice bathing products at the B&Bs
and historic hotels that fall into this
category.
$$$
$201–$300
Here, in the lower-end resort and
higher-end inn range, accommodations
begin to look plush. Think chocolates
on your pillow, a decent restaurant, or
an exercise room (or, in the case of
B&Bs and historic hotels, privileges at
a nearby health club).
$$$$
$301–$400
These top-rated — and top-priced —
lodgings come with luxury amenities
such as valet parking, major spa, golf
and tennis courts, and a restaurant
where the chef may have won a James
Beard award. 
$$$$$
More than $400
As with the properties in the previous
categories, expect amenities out the
wazoo. Add a staff that knows your
name (and possibly birthday) and
caters to your every whim.
Destination spas
These healthful retreats are where you go to have both mind and body
attended to. Stay at a destination spa — there are two in Tucson, one in
Sedona — and you don’t have to pay for anything beyond what’s included
Chapter 8: Booking Your Accommodations 73

in your original room package: all meals and snacks (healthy, of course),
classes, activities, and a certain number of spa treatments. No need to
rent a car, because you have no reason to leave the premises. All the
rooms at destination spas fall into the $$$$$ category.
Resorts
Most hotels and motels are designed to keep guests happy for a night 
or two, but resorts have a more ambitious mandate: They want to keep
you playing — and paying — for more extended periods. Arizona’s top
resorts, primarily located in Scottsdale, Phoenix, and Tucson, fulfill that
role to a tee (literally). You can expect at least one great golf course on
the premises (or, barring that, privileges at a few exclusive ones nearby),
along with a pool complex, exercise facilities, tennis courts, spa — and
some of the best restaurants and bars in the state.
Resorts also know that you may want to bring your family, so all have at
least some kid-friendly recreational facilities. Many have elaborate chil-
dren’s programs as well. If they don’t have baby-sitting or day-care facili-
ties on the grounds, they can refer you to a place you can trust — after
all, the resort’s reputation is on the line.
Your room won’t be anything to sneeze at, either. Accommodations and
grounds are constantly being refreshed, and you can expect the latest in
room decor and high-quality bathroom products. Standard amenities
include room service (sometimes 24-hour), laundry/valet service (usu-
ally except for Sun), minibars, hair dryers, irons/ironing boards, and
high-speed Internet access (though often for an extra charge). Many
resorts now offer wireless Internet access, gratis. Robes and in-room
wall safes are other semi-frequent features.
Naturally, none of these amenities comes cheap. Rack rates for most
resort rooms are in the $$$$ to $$$$$ range, beginning about $250 in
high season — at $400 in many Scottsdale locations. But almost every
resort runs a variety of packages, throwing in spa treatments, golf, a
bottle of champagne, breakfast in bed — pretty much any of the resort’s
services that you can think of, if you’re willing to spend two nights or
more. Because some resorts also cater to businesspeople, they may
offer weekend specials.
Guest ranches
Once upon a time in the early 20th century, ranchers had the clever idea
of renting out rooms to Easterners who were caught up in the romance
of the West. These entrepreneurs got a bit of extra spending money, and
the Easterners got fresh air and family fun. The heyday (or is that hay
day?) of Arizona’s dude ranches, now called guest ranches, may have
passed, and many of the original ranches have shut down, but several
remain, primarily around Tucson, southeast Arizona, and Wickenburg.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Arizona 
74

Guest ranches aren’t as rustic as they used to be. You can expect private
bathrooms (not necessarily with bathtubs, but all have at least a shower)
and basic bathing amenities, such as soap and shampoo, but otherwise
they vary widely. A few of the fancier ones may include hair dryers and
irons, but they’re the exception, not the rule. Similarly, a few guest
ranches have added amenities like an exercise room or golf course, but
far more typical are a swimming pool and low-tech recreation like volley-
ball, shuffleboard, and, of course, horseshoes. Kids always have plenty of
stuff to do — everything from petting zoos to crafts centers to such activ-
ities as riding or roping contests. At night, expect cookouts, hayrides,
sing-alongs, and other retro-Western activities.
Rates for a guest ranch stay are in the $$$$ to $$$$$ range, but they
include three hearty, all-American meals (alcohol extra or BYOB), two
horseback rides a day (in most cases; a few ranches offer unlimited
riding, while a few others charge extra for rides), and all other activities.
Most charge lower rates for a full week, and if you’re willing to stay put
and relax, you won’t have to shell out for a rental car.
Ranches often have a minimum stay, especially in high season, and many
of them shut down for at least part of the summer, if not for all of June,
July, and August. (Horses need a vacation, too, you know.)
Hotels, lodges, and inns
Arizona doesn’t have many modern high-rise hotels, in part because new
construction tends to go out (as in sprawling resorts or low-slung motels)
rather than up. In the past, many hotels either tried to pretend they
weren’t in Arizona or got into the mood of their locales with a vengeance.
As a result, you find a wonderful variety of historic lodgings in all shapes
and sizes — everything from funky old Victorian mining hotels with no
TVs in the rooms and, in some cases, shared bathrooms, to rustic-elegant
lodges that may no longer be luxurious but have the basics as well as
loads of character, to once-chic hotels and inns with revamped rooms 
to include amenities matching the fanciest resorts.
That funky mining hotel is going to be in the $ category; the rustic, ele-
gant lodge that provides, minimally, a private bathroom and TV, proba-
bly falls into the $$ or $$$ range; and the born-again chic inn or hotel
that has been refitted with top-notch room amenities and modern on-site
facilities, such as a spa, falls into the $$$$ or even $$$$$ price slot. The
pricier hotels, like the resorts, do offer special packages.
Bed-and-breakfasts
If you automatically associate the words bed-and-breakfast with a certain
British queen, you won’t be entirely disappointed in Arizona B&Bs. But
you can also find B&Bs far more characteristic of the state: one built of
adobe in the Tucson desert, a former bordello that now rents rooms in
Williams, even hogans (traditional Navajo homes) on the Navajo reserva-
tion. You find B&Bs scattered throughout the state, but the greatest 
Chapter 8: Booking Your Accommodations 75

concentrations are in Tucson and southeast Arizona and around Flagstaff,
Prescott, and Sedona. The vast majority of Arizona’s B&Bs tend to be com-
fortable but not luxurious. With a few exceptions, I don’t recommend
places with fewer than three rooms or ones that share bathrooms (I spec-
ify where that’s the case). You can expect full breakfasts — as opposed to
continental spreads — at almost all of them, and prices are generally in
the $$ category. The exception is Sedona, where the B&Bs tend to resem-
ble small luxury inns. These boast high-tone touches — expensive bath-
room toiletries, hair dryers, and individual breakfast menus — and rates
to match: Most of Sedona’s B&Bs fall into the $$$ to $$$$ slot.
In order to have room for the top choices in a variety of lodging cate-
gories, I don’t include all the good B&Bs in the state, but if you’re particu-
larly interested in this type of lodging, contact the Arizona Association of
Bed & Breakfast Inns (% 800-752-1912; www.arizona-bed-breakfast.
com), an organization that has strict membership guidelines.
Chain hotels
You pretty much have your pick of chain lodgings throughout Arizona. 
I can’t think of a single area that doesn’t have at least a few links (and I
don’t mean golf courses). See the appendix for the toll-free numbers for
those chains represented in the state. Rooms are generally in the $ or, at
the most, $$ price range.
Remember that not all links of a chain are necessarily alike. In Arizona,
for example, several Best Western hotels (including one in Tucson and
one in Wickenburg) have loads of historic character. The granting of a
franchise by a corporate office only means the franchisee has to live up
to certain standards; it doesn’t mean that the rooms have to be cookie-
cutter alike. That cuts both ways, of course: If the corporate headquar-
ters doesn’t impose strict and frequent quality checks on its members,
you may love the Hotel X in St. Louis, but be disappointed by the one in
Phoenix. Bottom line: Ask to look at the room before you put your John
Hancock on a credit card slip.
Finding the Best Room at the Best Rate
So, you have a general idea about what kind of room best suits you. Now
you need to figure out how to nab it — and at the best price.
Finding the best rate
The rack rate is the maximum amount a hotel charges for a room. It’s
the rate you get if you walk in off the street and ask for a room for the
night. You sometimes see these rates printed on the fire/emergency exit
diagrams posted on the back of your door.
Hotels are happy to charge you the rack rate, but you can usually do
better. Perhaps the best way to avoid paying the rack rate is surprisingly
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Arizona 
76

simple: Just ask for a cheaper or discounted rate. You may be pleasantly
surprised.
In all but the smallest accommodations, the rate you pay for a room
depends on many factors — chief among them being how you make your
reservation. A travel agent may be able to negotiate a better price with
certain hotels than you can get by yourself. (That’s because the hotel
often gives the agent a discount in exchange for steering his or her busi-
ness toward that hotel.)
Reserving a room through the hotel’s toll-free number may also result in
a lower rate than calling the hotel directly. On the other hand, the cen-
tral reservations number may not know about discount rates at specific
locations. For example, local franchises may offer a special group rate
for a wedding or family reunion, but they may neglect to tell the central
booking line. Your best bet is to call both the local number and the toll-
free number to see which one gives you a better deal.
Room rates (even rack rates) change with the season, as occupancy
rates rise and fall. Chapter 3 gives you good general guidelines about
what is defined as high season — the period when rooms are in most
demand — in different parts of the state. Some destinations and accom-
modations types are busier than others in high season, however. For
example, lodgings in Grand Canyon National Park of nearly every kind
are at a premium in July (high season), while a room at a Scottsdale
resort may be harder to book in February (high season) than, for exam-
ple, one at a nearby chain motel. And few events listed in the calendar 
of events section in Chapter 3 have a significant impact on room occu-
pancy (with the exception of the Gem and Mineral Show in Tucson). You
never know when a huge convention is going to descend on a resort that
you have your heart set on unless you call ahead.
For these and other reasons, even within a given season, room prices
are subject to change without notice. Thus the rates quoted in this book
may be different from the actual rate you receive when you make your
reservation. Be sure to mention membership in AAA, AARP, frequent-flier
programs, any other corporate rewards programs you can think of — or
your Uncle Joe’s Elks Lodge in which you’re an honorary inductee, for
that matter — when you call to book. You never know when the affilia-
tion may be worth a few dollars off your room rate.
Surfing the Web for hotel deals
Shopping online for hotels is generally done one of two ways: by booking
through the hotel’s own Web site or by going through an independent
booking agency (or a fare-service agency like Priceline). These Internet
hotel agencies have multiplied in mind-boggling numbers of late, com-
peting for the business of millions of consumers surfing for accommoda-
tions around the world. This competitiveness can be a boon to you if
you have the patience and time to shop and compare the online sites for
good deals, but shop you must, because prices can vary considerably
Chapter 8: Booking Your Accommodations 77

from site to site. And keep in mind that hotels at the top of a site’s listing
may be there for no other reason than that they paid money to get that
placement.
Of the “big three” sites, Expedia offers a long list of special deals and
“virtual tours” or photos of available rooms so you can see what you’re
paying for. Both Expedia and Travelocity post unvarnished customer
reviews; the latter also ranks its properties according to the AAA rating
system. Also reliable are Hotels.com and Quikbook.com. An excellent
free program, TravelAxe (www.travelaxe.net), can help you search
multiple hotel sites at once, even ones you may never have heard of, and
it conveniently lists the total price of the room, including the taxes and
service charges.
Even with reliable sites, it’s a good idea to get a confirmation number
and make a printout of any online booking transaction.
In the opaque Web site category, Priceline and Hotwire are even better
for hotels than for airfares; with both, you’re allowed to pick the neigh-
borhood and quality level of your hotel before offering up your money.
On the down side, many hotels stick Priceline guests in their least desir-
able rooms. Be sure to visit Sidestep (www.sidestep.com) before bid-
ding on a hotel room on Priceline; it features a fairly up-to-date list of
hotels that Priceline uses in major cities. For both Priceline and Hotwire,
you pay up front, and the fee is nonrefundable. Note: Some hotels do not
provide loyalty program credits or points or other frequent-stay ameni-
ties when you book a room through opaque online services.
Reserving the Best Room
After you make your reservation, asking one or two more pointed ques-
tions can go a long way toward making sure you get the best room in the
house. Ask whether the hotel is renovating, and then request a room
away from the renovation work. Inquire, too, about the location of the
restaurants, bars, and clubs in the hotel — all sources of annoying noise.
And if you aren’t happy with your room when you arrive, talk to the
front desk. If the hotel has another room available, the staff should be
happy to accommodate you, within reason.

Traveling with the Brood: Advice for Families
Arizona is a great place for a family vacation, no matter what sort of travel
you decide on. Just want to chill out at a resort? Most of the major ones
have full menus of children’s activities — fun for them and relaxing for
you. Throughout this book, the Kid Friendly icon highlights places and
activities particularly geared toward or welcoming to children, but when it
comes to accommodations, even the cheapest motels in southern Arizona
have swimming pools to keep kids happily splashing. Several places also
let children as old as 18 stay in your room for free (depending on the hotel
policy), so don’t forget to ask when you’re booking.
Food is no problem, either. Every chain restaurant you can think of is
represented in the state. But chains are only one option: Nearly every
city has Western steakhouses offering pint-size plates and a fun, rowdy
atmosphere; friendly, inexpensive Mexican eateries that always include
something on the menu for even the pickiest eater (including hambur-
gers); and casual roadside diners — you name it. Again, I use the handy
icon to mark restaurants especially suited for children and, except for
the really fancy places, you and your brood will be warmly welcomed
nearly everywhere. When you’re ready to hit the road, you can stock up
on healthful snacks in the cities’ huge supermarkets, and everywhere

you go, you see convenience stores galore (where you can stock up on
not-so-healthful supplies).
You can find the requisite water parks in and around the big cities and
video arcades in nearly every mall. Arizona doesn’t have a whole lot of
theme parks per se; Old Tucson Studios — in Tucson, of course — is the
only one that comes close. What Arizona does have, however, is far better:
Tons of places where kids can engage with nature and history in a fun (but
sneakily educational) way. Most are inexpensive to begin with and are

Quick travel-with-kids tips
About to explore Arizona with a car full of kids? Use the following tips to increase their
enjoyment and comfort while on the road.
In advance:
 Pack some of your youngest kids’ favorite books and toys, even if they add bulk
to your luggage. Going to unfamiliar places can be hard on even the most outgo-
ing youngsters, and security blankets of all sorts help.
 Have your children read up on Arizona. If they’re young, a book such as Susan
Howell’s Three Little Javelinas is great; older kids can go for Zane Grey’s Western
romances, nature books on the Sonoran Desert, or even corny films about Wyatt
Earp and the OK Corral, of which 28 celluloid versions exist. Kids get a kick out of
seeing the real thing later in Tombstone, where you can help them separate myth
from fact.
 Bring along protective gear — hats, sunglasses, and sunscreen (although you
won’t have a hard time finding these items in Arizona). Kids’ skin is super-sensitive
to Arizona’s powerful rays.
 Dig up fun car games from the recesses of your mind — or any other available
sources (identifying license plates is always good in a pinch). You may be putting
in lots of road time.
 If your kids are small, be sure to arrange with the car-rental companies for child-
safety seats.
When you’re there:
 Don’t let young children play in a pool unsupervised; tragedy can hit quickly.
 When in the desert, don’t leave kids in a locked car for even two minutes to run
in for a few items. Temperatures can rise to dangerously high levels before you
know it.
 Don’t overwhelm them with activities. Kids get sore muscles, too. Swimming, going
on a tour, and having dinner at a Western restaurant may be too much. Gear activ-
ities to your child’s age, physical condition, and attention span.

even less costly when you subtract children’s discounts. Chapter 3 offers
an itinerary especially suited for families, but wherever you go, you can
find activities to keep kids occupied, mind and body. (In this book, the
especially appropriate activities are tagged with icons.) Also see the
appendix.
Windwalker Expeditions (% 888-785-3382 or 480-585-3382; www.
windwalkerexpeditions.com), based in the Phoenix area, offers a 
variety of fun and educational activities that you can do together — for
example, pack trips and archaeology tours. The Arizona Science Center
(see Chapter 11) offers weeklong camps for ages 6 through 14 during the
winter and summer. And see also the astronomy camps in Tucson,
described later in this chapter.
You find family-oriented vacation advice on the Internet from sites like
Family Travel Forum (www.familytravelforum.com), a good resource
for customizing trip planning; Family Travel Network (www.family
travelnetwork.com), an award-winning site with lots of travel features,
deals, and tips; and Family Travel Files (www.thefamilytravelfiles.
com), which offers an online magazine and a directory of off-the-beaten-
path tours and tour operators for families.
The Phoenix-based monthly, Raising Arizona Kids (4545 E. Shea Blvd.,
Suite 168, Phoenix, AZ 85028; % 602-953-KIDS; www.raisingarizona
kids.com), concentrates on activities in the Valley of the Sun, but also
includes a statewide calendar of events geared toward children. Copies
are available at the Valley’s major bookstores (and other locations speci-
fied on the Web site) for $3.95 per issue, and by subscription for $19.95
per year.
Making Age Work for You: Tips for Seniors
With its several huge Sun City retirement communities and cadres of
retired snowbirds migrating down from colder climates come winter,
Arizona is extremely senior friendly. The state caters to older travelers
with everything from great golf courses to great medical facilities. The
only thing missing is widespread early-bird specials for dinner — but
that’s probably because everyone in the state eats early, anyway. Most
of the attractions in Arizona offer discounts to seniors. If available, these
rates are indicated in this book with the other price listings.
You can make your gray hairs pay even before you arrive in Arizona:
Mention the fact that you’re a senior citizen when you make your travel
reservations. Although all of the major U.S. airlines except America 
West — luckily, Arizona’s major carrier — have cancelled their senior
discount and coupon book programs, many hotels still offer discounts
for seniors.
Not yet 60? You can still reap the benefits of maturity that your birth cer-
tificate indicates you’ve achieved. One of them is membership in AARP
Chapter 9: Catering to Special Travel Needs or Interests 81

(formerly, the American Association of Retired Persons), 601 E St. NW,
Washington, DC 20049 (% 888-687-2277 or 202-434-2277; www.aarp.
org) — yes, first-wave baby boomers, you only have to be 50 to join.
AARP offers members a wide range of benefits, including discounts on
hotels, airfares, and car rentals, as well as AARP: The Magazine and a
monthly newsletter.
The U.S. National Park Service offers a Golden Age Passport that gives

Following the Rainbow: Resources 
for Gay and Lesbian Travelers
In most states, the cities with universities tend to have the most
resources for gays and lesbians. In Arizona, these cities include Greater
Phoenix (especially Tempe, home to Arizona State University) and
Tucson and, to a lesser degree, Flagstaff and Prescott. Tucson, the most
politically liberal city in a generally conservative state, is probably the
gay-friendliest of the four. You don’t find gay or lesbian residential neigh-
borhoods or nightlife areas in any of these cities, just specific clubs.
In Phoenix, the best source of information is the Greater Phoenix Gay &
Lesbian Chamber of Commerce (% 1-888-GAYAZ4U; www.gpglcc.org).
1N10 (% 602-475-7456; www.1n10.org) is another good resource for
Greater Phoenix gays. The Tucson-based Wingspan, 425 E. Seventh St. 
% 520-624-1779; www.wingspan.org reaches out to Southern Arizona’s
gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender community. Also in Tucson,
Antigone Bookstore (411 N. Fourth Ave.; % 520-792-3715) is a good
information source, especially for lesbians.
The International Gay and Lesbian Travel Association (IGLTA; % 800-
448-8550 or 954-776-2626; www.iglta.org) is the trade association for
the gay and lesbian travel industry and offers an online directory of gay-
and lesbian-friendly travel businesses; go to its Web site and click on
Members. Many agencies offer tours and travel itineraries specifically
for gay and lesbian travelers. Above and Beyond Tours (% 800-397-
2681; www.abovebeyondtours.com) is the exclusive gay and lesbian
tour operator for United Airlines. Now, Voyager (% 800-255-6951; www.
nowvoyager.com) is a well-known San Francisco–based gay-owned and 
-operated travel service. Travel articles oriented to gays and lesbians
are the focus of www.outtraveler.com.
The following travel guides are available at most travel bookstores and
gay and lesbian bookstores, or you can order them from Giovanni’s
Room bookstore, 1145 Pine St., Philadelphia, PA 19107 (% 215-923-2960;
www.giovannisroom.com; Spartacus International Gay Guide
(Bruno Gmünder Verlag; www.spartacusworld.com/gayguide) and
Odysseus (www.odyusa.com) both good, annual English-language guide-
books focused on gay men; and the Damron guides (www.damron.com),
with separate, annual books for gay men and lesbians.
Exploring Your Special Interests
Guest ranching (see Chapter 8) and golfing are just two of the state’s
specialties; other Arizona vacations cater to less obvious — but equally
engaging — interests.

Astronomy
Several of the astronomical observatories that you can visit on a daily
(or nightly) basis are detailed in Chapter 14. Want to extend your inter-
galactic adventure? The University of Arizona’s Alumni Association and
the Steward Observatory run a series of beginner and advanced astron-
omy camps each May, June, and October for adults and teens. Campers
bunk on Mt. Lemmon, just north of Tucson, and have access to advanced
telescopes. The price — $550 to $650 per person, depending on the length
of the session — includes meals and lodging. For details, call % 800-
BEAT-ASU (outside Arizona), 520-621-4079, or 520-621-5233; or log on to
www.astronomycamp.org.
Bird-watching
Chapter 15 details many of the excellent bird-watching spots in southeast
Arizona and lists various local resources and festivals. If you want to take
avian awareness even further, contact the southeast Arizona–based
Hilonesome Bird Tours (570 S. Little Bear Trail, Sierra Vista, AZ 85635; 
% 800-743-2668 or 520-458-9446; www.hilonesome.com), which runs
guided birding trips in the region. Several tours last about a week, but per-
sonalized single or half-day trips are options, too. You have to sign on for
longer excursions if you go with the Tucson-based Borderland Tours
(2550 W. Calle Padilla, AZ 85745; % 800-525-7753 or 520-882-7650; www.
borderland-tours.com) or with Field Guides (9433 Bee Cave Rd., Bldg.
1, Suite 150, Austin, TX 78733; % 800-728-4953 or 512-263-7295; www.
fieldguides.com), both of which run several southeast Arizona trips.
None of the longer trips runs cheap. Expect to pay upward of $1,900,
including food and nests for a week, but not including your flight.
Educational
The Ventures program of Flagstaff’s Museum of Northern Arizona 
(% 928-774-5213; www.musnaz.org/education/ventures.html)
offers a variety of educational vacations in the Four Corners area, 
with topics ranging from the archaeology of the Zuni to the geology of
Escalante Canyon. The adventure level is wide-ranging, too. Encounters
are day-trips with van support, Excursions are hotel-based, Explorations
include moderate day hikes and camping, while the Expeditions gener-
ally involve kayaking and more rugged physical activities. Most pro-
grams depart from the museum.
If you think the Grand Canyon may be a cool place to go to school, check
out the classes given by the Grand Canyon Field Institute (% 866-471-
4435; www.grandcanyon.org/fieldinstitute) from March through
November. Possibilities range from an introduction to backpacking and
rim-to-rim hikes to watercolor classes to hands-on archaeology digs.
Prices in 2006 started at $95 for an introductory day hike, going up to
$2,200 for a nine-day float trip on the San Juan River.

Golf
Many resorts in Scottsdale and, to a lesser degree, Phoenix and Tucson,
bundle golf deals in with their room rates. SGH Golf Inc. (% 800-284-
8884; www.sghgolf.com) tends to specialize in European greens, but
does offer several Scottsdale deals. If you’re devoted to improving your
game, check out Resort Golf Schools (% 888-373-7555; www.resort
golf.com), with programs in Scottsdale, Phoenix, and Tucson. Prices
range widely depending on your point of departure, interest in upscale
accommodations, and how much time you want to spend on the greens.
Photography
Arizona Highways magazine is renowned for its excellent photographs of
the state’s spectacular landscapes. If you go on one of the Friends of
Arizona Highways photography trips (% 888-790-7042 or 602-712-2004;
www.friendsofazhighways.com), you get some great photo tips and
are guaranteed incredible scenery. Offered in different parts of the state,
photo tours range from 3 to 11 days and cost from $950 to $3,695, includ-
ing round-trip transportation from Phoenix and, in most cases, all meals
and accommodations. Less extensive — and less expensive — weekend
workshops, starting at $75, are available, too.

 Dealing with airport security
O
kay, so you’ve decided when, where, and how you want to go to
Arizona. Now the time has come for those last picky details that
can make or break your trip.
Playing It Safe with Travel 
and Medical Insurance
Buying insurance is like carrying around an umbrella. If you have it, you
won’t need it. But insurance can be expensive. So, should you or shouldn’t
you buy it?
Three kinds of travel insurance are available: trip-cancellation, medical,
and lost luggage. The cost of travel insurance varies widely, depending
on the cost and length of your trip, your age and health, and the type of
trip you’re taking, but expect to pay between 5 percent and 8 percent of
the vacation itself. The following is my advice on all three:
 Trip-cancellation insurance helps you get your money back if you
have to back out of a trip, if you have to go home early, or if your
travel supplier goes bankrupt. Allowed reasons for cancellation can
range from sickness to natural disasters to the State Department
declaring your destination unsafe for travel.
 A good resource is “Travel Guard Alerts,” which is a list of compa-
nies considered to be high-risk by Travel Guard International
(www.travelinsured.com). Protect yourself further by paying for
the insurance with a credit card — by law, consumers can get their
money back on goods and services not received if they report the

loss within 60 days after the charge is listed on their credit card
statement. Note: Many tour operators, particularly those offering
trips to remote or high-risk areas, include insurance in the cost of
the trip or can arrange insurance policies through a partnering
provider, a convenient and often cost-effective way for the traveler
to obtain insurance. Make sure the tour company is a reputable
one, however: Some experts suggest you avoid buying insurance
from the tour or cruise company you’re traveling with, saying it’s
better to buy from a third-party insurer than to put all your money
in one place.
 For domestic travel, buying medical insurance for your trip 
doesn’t make sense for most travelers. Most existing health poli-
cies cover you if you get sick away from home, but check before
you go, particularly if you’re insured by an HMO.
Staying Healthy When You Travel
Getting sick will ruin your vacation, so I strongly advise against it (of
course, last time I checked, the bugs weren’t listening to me any more
than they probably listen to you).
For domestic trips, most reliable health-care plans provide coverage if
you get sick away from home (see the preceding section for information
on purchasing additional medical insurance for your trip).
Talk to your doctor before leaving on a trip if you have a serious and/or
chronic illness. For conditions such as epilepsy, diabetes, or heart prob-
lems, wear a MedicAlert identification tag (% 888-633-4298; www.
medicalert.org), which immediately alerts doctors to your condition
and gives them access to your records through MedicAlert’s 24-hour
hotline.
If you fear that your medical condition may flare up, traveling to the more
remote areas in northeastern Arizona isn’t a good idea. The American
Indian reservations have few modern hospitals, and those that exist are
far apart from one another.
If you do get sick in Arizona, try contacting your doctor back home to see
whether he or she can refer you to someone local. (Greater Phoenix and
Tucson have a large range of excellent medical facilities.) A friend of mine
had a medical emergency — a detached retina — while she was visiting
me in Tucson. When she phoned her eye doctor in Massachusetts, he
recommended a physician at a nearby clinic that specialized in retinal
surgery. Turned out, she felt she’d received better medical care and more
personalized attention than she usually got back home.
If you can’t get in touch with your doctor or don’t have one you can
phone, ask the concierge at your hotel to recommend a local physician —
even his or her own, if necessary. This recommendation is probably
better than what you can get from any national consortium of doctors.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Arizona 
88

If you can’t get a doctor to help you right away, try an Urgent Care
center, which treat emergency cases that aren’t life threatening; most
doctors or hospitals should be able to tell you where the nearest one is
located (in some cases, they are located within hospitals themselves).
You may not get immediate attention, but you won’t pay the high price
of an emergency room visit (usually a minimum of $300 just for signing
your name, plus whatever treatment you receive).
The bottom line: Don’t panic. Stress only compounds your symptoms.
Staying Connected by Cellphone
Just because your cellphone works at home doesn’t mean it works else-
where in the country. It’s a good bet that your phone will work in major
cities. But take a look at your wireless company’s coverage map on its
Web site before heading out. If you need to stay in touch at a destination
where you know your phone won’t work, rent a phone that does from
InTouch USA (% 800-872-7626; www.intouchglobal.com) or a rental-
car location, but be aware that it costs $1 a minute or more for airtime.
If you’re venturing deep into national parks, you may want to consider
renting a satellite phone (known as satphones), which are different from
cellphones in that they connect to satellites rather than ground-based
towers. A satphone is more costly than a cellphone but works where
there’s no cellular signal and no towers. Unfortunately, it costs at least
$2 per minute to use the phone, and it works only where you can see the
horizon (that is, usually not indoors and probably not in a deep canyon
or crevasse). In North America, you can rent Iridium satellite phones
from RoadPost (% 888-290-1606 or 905-272-5665; www.roadpost.com).
InTouch USA offers a wider range of satphones but at higher rates. As of
this writing, satphones were very expensive to buy.
If you’re not from the United States, you may be appalled at the poor
reach of our GSM (Global System for Mobiles) wireless network, which
is used by much of the rest of the world. Your phone will probably work
in most major U.S. cities; it definitely won’t work in many rural areas. (To
Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 89
Inventory your health
Although this chapter includes tips about health insurance, it doesn’t take your
machismo (or machisma) level into account. If you’ve never hiked a day in your life,
don’t plan on walking to the bottom of the Grand Canyon. And if your health is fragile,
going to a remote Native American reservation isn’t smart because you aren’t near
any contemporary medical facilities. Sticking near Phoenix or Tucson, both of which
are chock-a-block with specialty hospitals, is a far better idea.

see where GSM phones work in the United States, check out www.
t-mobile.com/coverage/national_popup.asp.) And you may or 
may not be able to send SMS (text messaging) home. Assume nothing —
call your wireless provider and get the full scoop. In a worst-case sce-
nario, you can always rent a phone; InTouch USA delivers to hotels.
You can rent a cellphone in Phoenix from Dollar Rent-a-Phone (% 800-
964-2468 or 212-734-6344; www.dollar-rent-a-phone.com). If you’re
heading down into the Grand Canyon and want to rent a satellite phone,
contact Professional River Outfitters (% 800-648-3236; www.pro
river.com).
Staying Connected by E-mail
When traveling, you have any number of ways to check your e-mail and
access the Internet on the road. Of course, using your own laptop — or
even a PDA (personal digital assistant) or electronic organizer with a
modem — gives you the most flexibility. But even if you don’t have a
computer, you can still access your e-mail and even your office computer.
The major cities in Arizona don’t have cybercafes, but they do have
branches of FedEx Kinko’s, where you can check your e-mail. You find
cybercafes in smaller Arizona towns like Flagstaff, Sedona, Page, and
Tusayan (near the Grand Canyon) but, at this writing, none exist on the
Native Indian reservations. Although there’s no definitive directory for
cybercafes, one place to start looking is www.cybercafe.com.
Aside from formal cybercafes, most youth hostels nowadays have at
least one computer on which you can access the Internet. And most
public libraries across the world offer Internet access free or for a small
charge. Avoid hotel business centers, unless you’re willing to pay exor-
bitant rates.
Most major airports now have Internet kiosks scattered throughout
their gates. These kiosks, which are also located in shopping malls, hotel
lobbies, and tourist information offices in Arizona, give you basic Web
access for a per-minute fee that’s usually higher than cybercafe prices.
If you’re traveling with your own computer, good news: More and more
hotels, cafes, and retailers are signing on as wi-fi (wireless fidelity)
“hotspots.” Mac owners have their own networking technology, Apple
AirPort. T-Mobile Hotspot (www.t-mobile.com/hotspot) serves up
wireless connections at more than 1,000 Starbucks coffee shops nation-
wide. Boingo (www.boingo.com) and Wayport (www.wayport.com)
have set up networks in airports and high-class hotel lobbies. IPass
providers (see below) also give you access to a few hundred wireless
hotel lobby setups. To locate other hotspots that provide free wireless
networks, go to www.personaltelco.net/index.cgi/Wireless
Communities.

For dial-up access, most business-class hotels in Arizona offer dataports
for laptop modems, and many hotels now offer free high-speed Internet
access. In addition, major Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have local
access numbers around the world, allowing you to go online by placing
a local call. The iPass network also has dial-up numbers around the
world; though you’ll have to sign up with an iPass provider, who will
then tell you how to set up your computer for your destination(s). For a
list of iPass providers, go to www.ipass.com and click on “Individuals
Buy Now.” One solid provider is i2roam (% 866-811-6209 or 920-235-
0475;www.i2roam.com).
Wherever you go, bring a connection kit of the right power and phone
adapters, a spare phone cord, and a spare Ethernet network cable — or
find out whether your hotel supplies them to guests.
Keeping Up with Airline Security Measures
With the federalization of airport security, security procedures at U.S.
airports are more stable and consistent than ever. Generally, you’ll be
fine if you arrive at the airport one hour before a domestic flight and
two hours before an international flight; if you show up late, tell an air-
line employee, and he or she will probably whisk you to the front of 
the line.
Bring a current, government-issued photo ID such as a driver’s license
or passport. Keep your ID at the ready to show at check-in, the security
checkpoint, and sometimes even the gate. (Children under 18 do not
need government-issued photo IDs for domestic flights, but they do for
international flights to most countries.)
In 2003, the TSA phased out gate check-in at all U.S. airports. And 
E-tickets have made paper tickets nearly obsolete. Passengers with 
E-tickets can beat the ticket-counter lines by using airport electronic
kiosks or even online check-in from your home computer. Online check-
in involves logging on to your airline’s Web site, accessing your reserva-
tion, and printing out your boarding pass — and the airline may even
offer you bonus miles to do so! If you’re using a kiosk at the airport,
bring the credit card you used to book the ticket or your frequent-flier
card. Print out your boarding pass from the kiosk and simply proceed to
the security checkpoint with your pass and a photo ID. If you’re check-
ing bags or looking to snag an exit-row seat, you will be able to do so
using most airline kiosks. Even the smaller airlines are employing the
kiosk system, but always call your airline to make sure these alternatives
are available. Curbside check-in is also a good way to avoid lines,
although a few airlines still ban curbside check-in; call before you go.
Security checkpoint lines are getting shorter than they were in the years
immediately after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, but some
doozies remain. If you have trouble standing for long periods of time, tell
Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 91

an airline employee; the airline will provide a wheelchair. Speed up secu-
rity by not wearing metal objects such as big belt buckles. If you’ve got
metallic body parts, a note from your doctor can prevent a long chat
with the security screeners. Keep in mind that only ticketed passengers
are allowed past security, except for folks escorting disabled passengers
or children flying solo.
Federalization has stabilized what you can carry on and what you can’t.
The general rule is that sharp things are out, nail clippers are okay, and
food and beverages must be passed through the X-ray machine, but secu-
rity screeners can’t make you drink from your coffee cup. Bring food in
your carry-on rather than checking it, because explosive-detection
machines used on checked luggage have been known to mistake food
(especially chocolate, for some reason) for bombs. Travelers in the
United States are allowed one carry-on bag, plus a “personal item,” such
as a purse, briefcase, or laptop bag. Carry-on hoarders can stuff all sorts
of things into a laptop bag; as long as it has a laptop in it, it’s still consid-
ered a personal item. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA)
has issued a list of restricted items; check its Web site (www.tsa.gov/
public/index.jsp) for details.
Airport screeners may decide that your checked luggage needs to be
searched by hand. You can now purchase luggage locks that allow
screeners to open and re-lock a checked bag if hand-searching is neces-
sary. Look for Travel Sentry–certified locks at luggage or travel shops
and Brookstone stores (also online at www.brookstone.com). These
locks, approved by the TSA, can be opened by luggage inspectors with a
special code or key. For more information on the locks, visit www.travel
sentry.org. If you use something other than TSA-approved locks, your
lock will be cut off your suitcase if a TSA agent needs to hand-search
your luggage.

the Sun, and its southern rival, Tucson. In this part, I give you
everything you need to know about both of them, from boring
nitty-gritty details, such as how to get from the airport to
your hotel, to far more interesting info, like the best places to

L
os Angeles without water, except for its oceans of swimming pools,
Phoenix epitomizes the new urban Southwest — leisure bent and
car obsessed. This northern Sonoran Desert city is only part, albeit a
major one, of a complex of satellites known collectively as the Valley 
of the Sun, which includes the tourist destinations of Scottsdale and
Tempe.
For visitors, this metroplex is the Valley of the Fun. Cultural venues and
sports — of both the watching and doing variety — are Phoenix’s prime
arena, while Scottsdale specializes in ritzy resorts, lush golf courses,
chic boutiques, posh spas, and upscale art galleries. Tempe, home to
Arizona State University, competes for tourist attention with a youthful
personality, strollable streets, and a town lake that has quickly become a
recreational haven for urbanites since its creation at the end of the last
century. But all the Valley towns share one key asset: plenty of year-
round sunshine and endless ways to play in it.
Getting There
Phoenix is Arizona’s prime transportation hub, receiving more flights
than anywhere else in the state and linking to all major highways — but
you can’t get there by train.

Flying in
More major airlines fly into Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport,
3 miles east of downtown Phoenix (% 602-273-3321; www.phxsky
harbor.com), than into any other city in the state (see Chapter 6 for
details). More than 41 million visitors pass through here annually —
which means that baggage retrieval can be a slow process. Phoenix is
the place where you’re likely to begin your Arizona trip, even if you’re
not staying in the Valley.
Some hotels and resorts offer free shuttle service. Ask before you leave
home if — and precisely where — you can expect to be picked up. Other
options for getting from the airport to your lodging include:
 Renting a car: All the major companies — Advantage, Alamo, Avis,
Budget, Dollar, Enterprise, Hertz, National, and Thrifty; see the
Appendix for the toll-free numbers — operate out of Sky Harbor, so
you’re bound to find your favorites, or at least the ones for which
you have discount coupons.
A new $270-million car-rental center (opened in early 2006) has cen-
tralized the rental process, with the goal of reducing congestion
throughout the airport’s pick-up and drop-off areas. Instead of indi-
vidual vans from the car-rental companies trolling the terminals,
larger buses, marked “Rental Car Shuttle,” are responsible for
whisking passengers around. Buses are always waiting, but it takes
about five to ten minutes to reach the facility, which is not very
close to Sky Harbor. I can’t say whether the new facility has cleared
up car clogs at the airport, but every time I’ve passed the I-10 free-
way exit to reach the rental center, I’ve seen a backup of cars. So
you may be able to depart Sky Harbor more quickly, but, at this
point, don’t count on being able to make a speedy vehicle return.
Light rail construction during 2007 is going to make traffic con-
gested on the east side of the airport (44th Street), so it’s probably
best to head directly for the freeways (see “Exploring by Car,” later
in this chapter) rather than taking local streets, even if your hotel is
nearby. Similarly, if you want to avoid the possibility of your route
being blocked by freight trains on the west, head straight for the
freeways on the 24th Street side. It’s always a good idea to check
the route to your accommodations on the Sky Harbor Web site,
http://phoenix.gov/AVIATION/maps_dir/directions.html,
so you can have an escape plan before you get into your rental 
car — and the airport traffic maze.
 Hailing a taxi or hopping a shuttle: Outside the baggage claim
area, you see queues of taxis from the only three companies
licensed for airport pickup: AAA Cab (% 602-437-4000), Allstate
Cab (% 602-275-8888), and Discount Cab (% 602-266-1110). All
charge $5 for the first mile and $2 for each additional mile, plus 
$1 for an airport surcharge, with a $15 minimum fare (exclusive of
the surcharge). If you’re stuck in traffic, you’ll pay an additional 
Part III: Exploring the Big Cities 
96

$20 per hour. SuperShuttle (% 800-BLUE VAN or 602-244-9000;
www.supershuttle.com) vans provide reliable door-to-door serv-
ice valley-wide, 24/7, with service running approximately every 
15 minutes from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., less often outside those hours.
The “Ground Transportation” signs in each terminal direct you to
the pickup areas. A company agent stationed on the center island
outside of baggage claim calls a van for you when you’ve retrieved
your luggage and are ready to hit the road. Fares are based on the
zip code of your destination. If you’re heading to central or down-
town Phoenix, you pay about $7 to $15 for the first person, and $6
for each additional person. Trips to surrounding areas, such as
Scottsdale, cost an average of $16 for the first person and $6 for
each additional person; children ages 3 and younger ride free.
Credit cards are accepted, and tips are expected.
The farther from the airport you’re headed, the more sense it
makes to use the shuttle. If, on the other hand, you’re traveling a
shorter distance to downtown Phoenix or Tempe, a cab is likely to
be quicker (no stops for other passengers) and cost about the
same (or less). The shuttle operates on an as-needed basis, so you
don’t need to make reservations before you arrive in town. When
returning to the airport, however, call a day in advance to arrange a
pickup from your hotel.
 Taking the bus: Valley Metro (see the “Getting around Phoenix”
section later in this chapter) offers daily direct bus service from
terminals 2, 3, and 4 of Sky Harbor Airport to downtown Phoenix
and to central Tempe. If you don’t have much luggage, the bus is a
good deal: For $1.25, you can get to Tempe and downtown Phoenix
in about 20 minutes. Although free transfers to Scottsdale and
other Valley destinations are available, the savings isn’t generally
worth the chunk of time this form of transit carves from your vaca-
tion (and if you’re staying in Scottsdale, you’re probably not on a
really tight budget).
To reach downtown Phoenix, take the Red Line westbound. Buses
run about every 15 minutes Monday through Friday from 5:06 a.m.
to 12:32 a.m.; Saturday and Sunday they start at 5:27 a.m. and stop
at 12:57 a.m. and 10:27 p.m., respectively. To reach Tempe, catch
the Red Line eastbound. Buses run about every 15 minutes from
3:37 a.m. to 12:06 a.m. weekdays, 5:21 a.m. to 12:21 a.m. Saturdays,
and 4:51 a.m. to 10:21 p.m. Sundays. The Bus Book, which lists
schedules, is sometimes available at the airport tourist information
desk, but don’t count on it; call % 602-253-5000 or log on to www.
valleymetro.org to check the times.
Driving in
Two interstates run into and through Phoenix — I-10, which extends
from Florida to southern California, and I-17, which, despite its name,
isn’t really an interstate because it only goes north to Flagstaff, where it
turns into Arizona Highway 89. This road does, however, hook up at
Chapter 11: Phoenix, Scottsdale, and the Valley of the Sun 97

Flagstaff with I-40, a genuine interstate that stretches from North Carolina
to California. See the “Getting around Phoenix” section later in this chap-
ter, for descriptions of some of the more minor arteries into town.
Riding in (no, not on horseback)
If you’re riding Greyhound (% 800-231-2222; www.greyhound.com),
you can roll into one of several area stations, including Phoenix, Tempe,
and Mesa. The main terminal is in Phoenix at 2115 E. Buckeye Rd. 
(% 602-389-4200), near Sky Harbor Airport.
Amtrak (% 800-872-7245; www.amtrak.com) doesn’t really offer train
service to Phoenix, but bus service at the Phoenix Greyhound station
near Sky Harbor offers connections to Amtrak Thruway.
Introducing the Neighborhoods
The Valley is made up of a series of cities and towns. Getting to know
their names can make getting around a lot easier on you. Within these
cities and towns are smaller geographical sub-units, but, don’t forget,
you’re not in Kansas (or, better for this example, Boston) anymore: With
few exceptions, these sprawling New West towns don’t divvy up into
neighborhoods in the traditional sense of the term.
Phoenix
Most of Phoenix’s attractions are in the downtown and Camelback
Corridor areas, but South Mountain and the Papago Salado regions have
a few tourist hooks, too.
Part III: Exploring the Big Cities

Orienting yourself
Don’t be surprised if you find the Valley a bit daunting; I still do after years of driving
up from Tucson. Here’s what helps me find my way. I picture the entire Valley as a
donut clock — what can I say? I have a vivid imagination that usually involves food —
with Sky Harbor Airport as its more-or-less empty center; aside from the runways and
the old railroad tracks, not much else is in this area. Starting from 12:00 where
Phoenix’s Camelback Corridor district lies, you move around this junk-food timepiece
to Paradise Valley (1:00), East Phoenix and Scottsdale (1:00–3:00), Mesa and Tempe
(4:00–5:00), South Phoenix (6:00), and downtown Phoenix (9:00). Beyond the more
remote sections of Phoenix that run along I-17 from 9:00 to 12:00 is what’s called the
West Valley, a largely suburban and residential region; its best-known towns are
Glendale, Peoria, the two Sun City planned-retirement communities, and, more
recently, Surprise, to the far west, You’re likely to spend most of your visit in Phoenix
and the East Valley, where, generally, the farther north and east you go of downtown
Phoenix, the ritzier it gets.

Phoenix, Scottsdale, and the Valley of the Sun Orientation
In the throes of a building frenzy, the formerly seedy southern sector of
downtown, roughly bounded by Fillmore Street (north), Jefferson Street
(south), 1st Avenue (west), and 7th Street (east), embraces several high-
and low-tone tourist zones. Within downtown, the 90-square-block area
dubbed Copper Square includes two major sports stadiums — Chase
Field and US Airways Center — both directly south of Jefferson; Heritage
Square and the adjacent museum complex, including the Arizona Science
Center; the glitzy Arizona Center entertainment/dining/office complex; and
the nearby cultural hub of the Herberger, Dodge, and Orpheum theaters.

The northern edge of downtown is where you’ll find mostly older busi-
nesses, some newer corporate headquarters, and two actual neighbor-
hoods: the ritzy Encanto/Palmcroft enclave near Encanto Park and, to
the east, Willo, more middle class but artsy, with lots of appealing old
bungalows. Nearby are the Margaret T. Hance Park (also known as Deck
Park), the Arizona Historical Society Museum, the Phoenix Art Museum,
and the Heard Museum.
The Camelback Corridor, extending along Camelback Road through
North Central Phoenix toward Scottsdale (roughly from 20th to 44th
streets), has fewer tourist attractions; its gleaming rows of office towers
are interspersed with upscale shops, hotels, and restaurants. The
wealthy residential Arcadia (44th to 68th streets from Camelback to
Indian School Roads), which was once swathed with ranches and orange
groves, abuts the corridor.
Papago Salado, named for Phoenix’s earliest Native American settlers, is
a mostly faceless, freeway-ridden area at the conjunction of Phoenix,
Scottsdale, and Tempe. However, calling the area home are the Desert
Botanical Garden, Phoenix Zoo, and Papago Park northwest of Highway
202, and the Pueblo Grande Museum and Archaeological Park, sand-
wiched between Highways 143 and 153.
South Phoenix, a largely Hispanic area that is slowly being revitalized,
hosts the huge South Mountain Park and, just before its entrance, the
fortress-like Mystery Castle. A few resorts and the large Arizona Mills
mall are in this area, too.
Scottsdale
Arizona’s answer to Palm Springs, Scottsdale is a newer, hipper version
of the California town that coined the concept of wealthy desert chic.
The long, skinny city of about 217,000 people stretches some 31 miles
from Tempe in the south to Carefree in the north. Not very long ago, you
could see endless stretches of empty desert along the northern part of
Scottsdale Road, the town’s main drag, but now you’re hard pressed to
guess where Scottsdale ends and the manicured planned community of
Carefree starts (okay, the intersecting Carefree Road is a dead giveaway).
Part III: Exploring the Big Cities 
100
The fabulous resorts of . . . Pumpkinville?
The Mormons who settled in the Valley of the Sun in the 1860s called Phoenix
“Pumpkinville” after the gourds that grew along the canals built by the Hohokam
Indians. Englishman Darrell Dupa proclaimed in 1868 that “a new city will spring
phoenix-like upon the ruins of a former civilization.” This statement inspired the state
legislature to adopt the city’s more romantic, if less colorful (well, at least not orange)
moniker.

Not surprisingly, the town tends to be divided into shopping and arts
districts (see the “Shopping the Local Stores” section later in this chap-
ter for more details). Downtown Scottsdale, near Tempe, runs roughly
between Osborn Road (south), Camelback Road (north), 68th Street
(west), and Drinkwater Boulevard (east); within that area, the 4 square
blocks of now touristy Old Town have authentic historic cachet. The
latest downtown project, the Scottsdale Waterfront, slated for comple-
tion in 2007, brings a host of new shops, restaurants, and high-rise hous-
ing and office buildings to the side of a narrow, newly hydrated canal.
Scottsdale Road between Indian School Road and Shea Boulevard has
been dubbed Resort Row because of — you guessed it — its abundance
of large, upscale lodgings.
Paradise Valley
Nestled just west of central Scottsdale, Paradise Valley may be the most
exclusive stretch of real estate in the Valley. The almost entirely residen-
tial area holds large, desert-embracing estates. A few hotels and resorts
may bring you here if you don’t happen to have rich relatives.
Tempe
Home to Arizona State University, Tempe comes closest to what is tradi-
tionally considered a town. You can stroll along its main drag, Mill
Avenue, and actually see other people. Tempe has always had a thriving,
student-driven nightlife, but aside from the museums and the Sun Devil
Stadium on the ASU campus, tourists used to find little here during the
day. That changed with the opening in 1999 of the man-made Tempe
Town Lake, which flows between the Rio Salado Parkway and Highway
202 along a formerly dry bed of the Salt River. Although it has become a
center for aquatic activities, Tempe Town Lake hasn’t yet sprouted a
waterfront restaurant and retail scene. However, such development is
likely to follow fast on the heels of the $65-million Tempe Center for the
Arts, slated to open in early 2007, as well as on completion of a lakeside
condominium complex.
Mesa
For a long time, tourist traffic to low-key, Mormon-founded Mesa was
largely restricted to spring, when the Cactus League teams played at its
stadiums. Now, not only has the city’s downtown been revitalized
Chapter 11: Phoenix, Scottsdale, and the Valley of the Sun 101
Unplugged in Arizona
No need to connect your laptop in Tempe. The Mill Avenue District, home to Arizona
State University, raised a wi-fi umbrella in 2005; and, in 2006, Tempe became the first
city in the country to go entirely wireless — or so the claim goes.

through a Main Street project, but the new Mesa Arts Center, with an
array of stages, workshops, and galleries, makes it a hot, year-round des-
tination for sophisticated Valley dwellers and visitors alike.
Glendale and Surprise
Of all the West Valley towns, Glendale is one that out-of-towners are
most likely to visit. Among its advantages: proximity to downtown and
central Phoenix; a strollable downtown of its own, with lots of historic
buildings, antiques shops, and the charming Bead Museum; and two new
state-of-the-art sports fields: the Glendale Arena and Cardinals Stadium.
Further west, the generally faceless Surprise also found that, if you build
an arena, they — in this case, Cactus League fans — will come. The
town’s latest draw is a new branch of the Heard Museum.
Cave Creek and Carefree
At the northernmost reaches of the Valley, just beyond Scottsdale, the
manicured community of Carefree is home to The Boulders Resort and
the El Pedregal shopping complex, as well as a huge sundial and a walka-
ble downtown with upscale boutiques and restaurants. Just beyond that,
Cave Creek, founded in 1870 as a mining town, has an Old West flavor —
along with its fair share of tony shops and chichi eateries.
Finding Information after You Arrive
The bilingual — that’s Spanish and English — staff at the information
booths in each of the airport terminals dispenses tour brochures, city
maps, and other introductory information.
The Greater Phoenix Convention and Visitors Bureau has two walk-in
centers: 50 N. 2nd St. at Adams, downtown (% 602-452-6268; Mon–Fri 
8 a.m.–5 p.m.), and Biltmore Fashion Park, 24th Street and Camelback
Road (% 602-452-6281; Mon–Fri 10 a.m.–7 p.m., Sat 10 a.m.–6 p.m., and
Sun noon–6 p.m.). (You’ll find the second location between Macy’s and
Christofle, if you don’t get sidetracked.)
The Scottsdale Area Chamber of Commerce/Convention and Visitors
Bureau, 4343 N. Scottsdale Rd., Suite 170, inside the Galleria Corporate
Center (% 480-421-1004) is open Monday through Friday 8:30 a.m. to 
6 p.m. The Scottsdale CVB also has staff at the concierge desk in
Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall, at the corner of Scottsdale and
Camelback roads (Tues–Fri 1 p.m.–6 p.m., and Sat 11 a.m.–4 p.m.).
Getting around Phoenix
Greater Phoenix practically defines the term urban sprawl, and it’s
severely public-transportation-challenged to boot (though a recent 
Part III: Exploring the Big Cities 
102

allotment of $587 million in federal funds will link Phoenix, Tempe, and
Mesa via light rail by the end of 2008). Unless you’re checking out a con-
centrated area like downtown Phoenix, Old Scottsdale, or Mill Avenue in
Tempe, you need wheels if you want to see anything. Interested in explor-
ing with just two of them? See the “Staying Active” section later in this
chapter for the best urban and rural biking routes.
Exploring by car
Because of multiple mergings and name metamorphoses, the many high-
ways that thread through the Valley aren’t always easy to navigate. I-17,
which leads north to Flagstaff, is the Valley’s main north-south thorough-
fare. Just south of downtown Phoenix, I-17 veers east and merges with 
I-10, at which point the road becomes the Maricopa Freeway. I-10
snakes through the Valley in a variety of directions, but in the west
Valley and downtown Phoenix, where it’s called the Papago Freeway,
I-10 generally runs from east to west. North of the airport, I-10 connects
with Highway 202 (almost always called Loop 202, though its official
name is the Red Mountain Freeway). If you head east on 202, you get to
downtown Tempe. Continue east along Loop 202 past Tempe to Highway
101 (a.k.a. Loop 101) north if you want to get to north Scottsdale. From
the east, the best route is Loop 101, which connects with Loop 202 and
Highway 60, the Superstition Freeway. Highway 60 leads east through
Tempe and Mesa toward Apache Junction and the Superstition Mountains
(see Chapter 12). In the other direction, when Highway 60 gets beyond 
I-10, it becomes Grand Avenue and then merges with Highway 89 as it
winds its way (slowly!) northwest through Glendale, Peoria, Sun City,
and Surprise toward Wickenburg.
Three roads you have less need to think about are Highway 51 or
Piestewa Peak Parkway, mostly useful for traveling from central Phoenix
to north Phoenix, though it also connects to I-10, Loop 101, and Loop 202
(see above); Highway 143, the short Hohokam Expressway, which con-
nects Loop 202 with I-10 on the east side of the airport; and Highway 87,
the Beeline Highway, which starts in Mesa and heads northeast.
Make sure you have your directions planned out before you hit the road.
You and your navigator aren’t going to have much map-consulting time
while you’re freeway-switching.
Chapter 11: Phoenix, Scottsdale, and the Valley of the Sun 103
Whoa, there!
Phoenix vies with Las Vegas as America’s fastest-growing large (population of more
than 1 million) city, boasting a growth rate of 40 percent during the 1990s. It overtook
Philadelphia as the country’s fifth-largest city in 2004 and still holds this distinction
today.

Driving the streets is less confusing, if more time consuming: Phoenix,
Scottsdale, and Tempe all operate pretty much on grids. The address
nexus of the Valley is the intersection of Washington Street and Central
Avenue in downtown Phoenix. Running north and south to the west of
Washington are numbered avenues (they go from 1st Avenue up to 107th
Avenue and higher in such West Valley cities as Glendale, Peoria, and
Sun City); east of Washington are the numbered streets. The east-west
thoroughfares have names; Camelback, Indian School, and McDowell
roads are major routes across central Phoenix.
In Scottsdale, as opposed to the rest of the Valley, the left-turn arrows
appear at the end of the light, not at the beginning. If you don’t know the
precise boundaries between Scottsdale, Phoenix, and Tempe — and
most Valley residents don’t — assuming you can turn left can be danger-
ous. Always wait until you see the green arrow before moving into an
intersection.
The Valley of the Sun is so large — 9,127 square miles if you include all
22 incorporated cities — that AAA has three maps available for Greater
Phoenix: The Phoenix/Arizona Vicinity map covers the entire Valley 
and includes all the new freeways. The one whose folds you’ll probably
wear out is called Phoenix/East Suburbs. Phoenix/West Suburbs is the
third one. For information on the locations of AAA offices, see the
Appendix.
Traveling by taxi
Unless you’re on a company expense account or traveling within a very
limited area, taking taxis isn’t a great way to get around. Don’t expect to
be able to hail a cab on the street, even in downtown Phoenix (the excep-
tion is when a sports or concert event is taking place). You have to phone
for your wheels and not on the spur of the moment, either. If you’re on a
tight schedule, book at least an hour in advance. The Greater Phoenix area
has more than 40 taxi companies, but some of the more reliable ones
include Yellow Cab (% 602-252-5252), Allstate Cab (% 602-275-8888),
Part III: Exploring the Big Cities

Light rail, heavy traffic
The good news: The first section of the Valley Metro light rail system is slated to open
in December 2008. The bad news: During construction along the 20-mile route, visi-
tors who drive in central Phoenix, Tempe, and west Mesa should plan on some extra
travel time. Construction runs south on 19th Avenue between Bethany Home and
Camelback roads, then east on Camelback, and south on Central Avenue through
downtown Phoenix, where it snakes east again along Washington Street. In Tempe,
the route crosses over Tempe Town Lake in the busy downtown, continuing along
Apache Boulevard until it reaches Mesa. Check construction updates before hitting
the road by logging on to www.ValleyMetro.org/rail or phoning 602-291-RAIL.

and Scottsdale Taxi (% 480-994-4567). Keep in mind, however, that
you’re likely to go a far stretch and that taxi fares are unregulated.
Always ask ahead of time how much the fare will be and confirm before
stepping into the cab.
Riding a bus or trolley
The Valley Metro Bus System (% 602-253-5000; www.valleymetro.org)
services Phoenix, Scottsdale, Tempe, Mesa, and Gilbert, but coverage
isn’t exactly comprehensive, although it’s improved in the last few 
years. You can sometimes find a copy of the Bus Book at the airport, at
Central Station on Van Buren Street and Central Avenue, and at any Fry’s
or Safeway supermarket, but taking advantage of the telephone trip-
planning service (available through the main number) is far easier. Fares
are $1.25 for adults, 60¢ for ages 6 to 18 and seniors over 65, and free for
children younger than 6 accompanied by an adult. Buses are equipped
to accept dollar bills, but you need exact change. You can get free trans-
fers between routes — they’re good for 60 to 90 minutes after your bus
reaches its final destination — but you need to ask for one when you pay
your fare.
Staying in Style
The Valley’s hospitality industry has rarely skipped a beat since the turn
of the 20th century and continues to grow as quickly as the Phoenix
metro area itself — maybe even faster. Although no major new resorts
have opened in the last year, the existing properties are in an intense
competition to outdo one another with new facilities, especially spas.
Chapter 11: Phoenix, Scottsdale, and the Valley of the Sun 105
Free-for-all
Although bussing around the Valley isn’t generally the best way to go, you can’t 
lose by taking advantage of three Valley transit freebies. Call Valley Metro
(% 602-253-5000) or log on to www.valleymetro.org for exact schedules.
 DASH (Downtown Area Shuttle) makes frequent daily runs (approximately every
six minutes) around Copper Square in downtown Phoenix. Look for the DASH stop
sign at any one of the 29 stops between 18th Avenue and 5th Street within the
boundaries of Jefferson and Van Buren streets.
 FLASH (Free Local Area Shuttle) loops around the areas surrounding Arizona State
University in Tempe every day.
 The Scottsdale Trolley provides free rides in downtown Scottsdale, Monday
through Saturday (except on New Years Day, Memorial Day, Fourth of July, Labor
Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas). Look for the bright yellow and purple signs.

Part III: Exploring the Big Cities 
108
These mini leisure worlds are a prime reason to visit Arizona, so I devote
the following section to them; see Chapter 8 for details on what you can
expect for resort amenities. And don’t forget to ask about special pack-
ages, also described in Chapter 8.
The second lodging section covers hotels and inns, several of which
have been recycled in the last couple of years (can you say “retro-chic”?).
The Valley has some dazzlers in this category, but because of compli-
cated zoning practices, few bed and breakfasts. Again, make sure to ask
about special packages when you call; many hotels offer them. The vast
majority of listings in both sections are for lodgings in Scottsdale and
Phoenix, the most visitor-friendly locations, but I also include two in
Tempe — not only a nice place to wake up, but also extremely conven-
ient to Sky Harbor airport.
Because of its appeal as a winter escape, the Valley is one of the most
expensive places in the United States for a vacation. A standard room at
a resort in Phoenix or Scottsdale usually falls into the $$$$ ($301–$400)
category, with many rooms listed for $401 and beyond ($$$$$) in high
season. If you’re looking to save a few bucks, you may want to consider
a B&B or even a mid-price chain (see the Appendix for the toll-free num-
bers). Predicting precisely when the hotels will be busy is difficult
(major sports events are a factor, as are major snowstorms in the rest 
of the country), but the Valley is popular from mid-December through
March — which is also when (surprise, surprise) the rates are highest.
See Chapter 3 for more details on seasonal and monthly happenings.
And check the Arizona Office of Tourism’s Vacation Values Web site,
www.arizonavacationvalues.com, to find out what rooms are on sale
during your visit.
Note: The top hotels and resorts are getting increasingly tech savvy.
Expect high-speed Internet access in most high-end guest rooms and, in
many cases, wi-fi in public areas.
Resorts
Arizona Biltmore Resort & Spa
$$$$–$$$$$
Phoenix/Camelback Corridor
A local favorite since opening its Southwest Art Deco doors — designed,
like the rest of the resort, by one of Frank Lloyd Wright’s colleagues — in
1929, the Biltmore stays at the leisure-cutting edge with such amenities as
guided mountain biking excursions and the latest spa treatments, while
maintaining such gracious old-style features as croquet and high tea (in
high season). Rooms are understatedly elegant, and the grounds are gor-
geous, acres of rolling lawns poised against craggy Camelback Mountain.
The Biltmore was the spur for Phoenix’s thriving Camelback (or Biltmore)
Corridor of restaurants and shops and remains its anchor, so you’re close
to some of the Valley’s top retail and dining. You’re not far, either, from

Chapter 11: Phoenix, Scottsdale, and the Valley of the Sun 109
many of Phoenix’s top tourist sights, so this place makes a very conven-
ient base.

The Boulders Resort & Golden Door Spa
$$$$$
Carefree
No other resort even came close to maximizing a rugged desert setting as
stunningly as The Boulders until the Four Seasons debuted in the new mil-
lennium. This resort’s other advantages include a branch of the famed
southern California pamper palace, the Golden Door Spa; superlative
Southwest-design casitas (“little houses”); two excellent golf courses; and
the on-site El Pedregal shopping center (see the “Getting [boutique]
mall’d” section later in this chapter), with a branch of the Heard Museum,
no less. In 2006, The Boulders began its transformation into the first all-
organic resort in the U.S. (that includes the in-room minibars, so BYO junk
food if you crave it). This resort is convenient for those planning day-trips
north from the Valley — say, to Sedona — and is close to the shops and
restaurants of Cave Creek, though the Valley’s prime sightseeing attrac-
tions are fairly far away.

The Buttes, A Marriott Resort
$$$$
Tempe
The good news is that this resort sits atop a mountain overlooking Phoenix
and the Valley. The bad news is that its great views are fronted by a free-
way. Similarly, the resort’s dramatic design and landscaping — the lobby
incorporates a cliff — are undermined by motel-like guest rooms. Still, you
have all the leisure facilities you could want (except on-site golf), includ-
ing the new Narande spa; you can’t beat the convenience to Sky Harbor
Airport; and rates are quite reasonable for this high-rent district.

free with adult. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V.

Camelback Inn, a JW Marriott Resort & Spa
$$$$–$$$$$$
Scottsdale
It’s easy to see why JW Marriott, who had been vacationing here with his
family since the 1940s, acquired the inn as his first resort in 1967. The
Camelback is as laid-back as ever; the newer casitas blend in beautifully
with the original adobe units; and kids still graduate from the Hopalong
College with a double major in fun. But pleasurable add-ons such as the
golf courses, a huge, recently revamped spa, and a splashy pool complex
all take up square footage, so you may have a tough time finding parking
near your stylish, home-away-from-home casita — or finding it period.
That said, Camelback maintains its spot on my list of personal favorites,
as a gateway to both Old Arizona ambience and New Arizona amenities
like chic shops and restaurants.

480-948-1700. Fax: 480-951-5452. www.camelbackinn.com. Self-parking free; valet

June–early Sept $189–$219 double, suites from $500; mid-Sept to Dec $299–$429
double, suites from $800. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V.
The Fairmont Scottsdale Princess
$$$$$
North Scottsdale
With red-tile-roof casitas and a hacienda-style dining and recreation com-
plex, the Fairmont takes full advantage of its place in the Sonoran Desert
sun. While dining rooms like the Marquesa and the Hacienda (see “A
Mexican lexicon” sidebar later in this chapter) pay tasty — and stylish —
tribute to the area’s Hispanic roots. Rooms are as elegantly Southwest as
you’d expect, but the grounds are spread out; so, if you’re as directionally
challenged as I am, you may find yourself wandering around to find yours.
You won’t be far from lots of good dining and shopping in north Scottsdale
if you bed down here, but you will have a bit of a car trek to many major
tourists sights. Perks include access to the huge, spectacular Willow
Stream spa, great tennis (unusual in this area), and tee-time priority at the
adjacent Tournament Players Club of Scottsdale.

$179–$439 double, suites from $289. Children 17 and under stay free with parent. AE,
DC, DISC, MC, V.
Four Seasons Resort Scottsdale at Troon North
$$$$$
Northeast Scottsdale
The stylish Four Seasons chain pulled out all the stops with its first
Arizona link, nabbing a beautiful, still more-or-less remote location; tak-
ing advantage of its unusual rock formations; and creating stunning, 
Part III: Exploring the Big Cities 
110

quintessential Southwest rooms and public areas. The two adjacent Troon
North golf courses are as challenging as they come; the views of the Valley
from the Acacia dining room are awesome; and a new Southwestern art
gallery adds culture to the magic mix. This property would be among my
top picks if I wanted an idyllic golf or spa getaway, but not if I was plan-
ning to do a lot of sightseeing (that’s the downside of the still more-or-less
remote location).

Hyatt Regency Scottsdale at Gainey Ranch
$$$$$
North Scottsdale
Water, water everywhere. What with the ten pools, waterslides, koi ponds,
lagoons, waterfalls, and the recently added Spa Avania, you might forget
you’re actually in arid Arizona. All that agua — not to mention a great kids’
camp — makes the Hyatt wildly popular with families. Besides, you have
the unique Native American and Environmental Learning Center and
Southwest flora and fauna tours on the grounds, not to mention rooms
subtly decked out in Southwestern earth tones to bring you back to the
land. The New American cuisine at Vu, the resort’s fine-dining room (see
the “Dining Out” section later in this chapter), is as dazzling as the restau-
rant’s decor.

The Phoenician
$$$$$
Scottsdale
This is where the well-to-do come to enjoy Southern Arizona’s sunny
weather without being exposed to the region’s prickly landscape. In addi-
tion to all the requisite resort amenities — top-notch golf; a great spa —
this place has lots of features you don’t usually find in the Valley:
Underground parking, acres of grassy lawns, rooms that don’t hint of the
Southwest (although they’re airy and understatedly elegant), as well as
what may be Arizona’s most formal restaurant, Mary Elaine’s (see the
“Dining Out” section later in this chapter). For such a posh place, it’s sur-
prisingly kid-friendly, with a super waterslide and the Funicians Kids Club,
a supervised activities program for children ages 5 to 12.

South Phoenix
The ultimate jock retreat. We’re talking an 18-hole golf course plus an
indoor, 3D golf trainer; five tennis courts; five racquetball courts; two vol-

size of an airport hangar with a sports medicine clinic, plus Arizona’s
largest resort water park, with a river ride, giant wave pool, and three

of South Mountain Park. You’ll enjoy your attractive Southwest-chic room —

Sanctuary on Camelback Mountain
$$$$$
Paradise Valley
A magnet for the monied young and restless (and sometimes famous to
boot), this intimate property nestled against Camelback Mountain has a
dual personality: part gracious Mediterranean getaway, part chic Zen
retreat. The newer rooms, spa, and elements restaurant, clustered lower
on the mountain, are stunningly pared down, while the less austere 
red-tile-roof casitas higher up feature gracious Mission-style furniture and
bathtubs surrounded by votive candles. Both types are beautiful, and all
offer luxurious touches, such as 300-thread-count sheets and Frette robes.
And no matter where you stay, you have sweeping vistas of the Valley and
of Mummy Mountain and Piestewa Peak.

Scottsdale Resort & Conference Center
$$$–$$$$
Scottsdale
If you’re seeking a Scottsdale resort–style setting without paying
Scottsdale resort prices, this Spanish hacienda–style complex is a good
bet. These lush grounds in a quiet residential area are convenient to down-
town and northern shopping and dining, as well as two adjacent 18-hole
golf courses. The large, attractive rooms have a Spanish Old-World air
(studded-leather headboards, dark wood armoires), but because this place
was almost exclusively geared toward conference travelers in the past, all
rooms offer high-speed Internet access and other business-friendly fea-
tures. The downside: no major spa.

Sheraton Wild Horse Pass Resort & Spa
$$$–$$$$
Gila River Indian Reservation, near Chandler
A river runs through it, and wild horses roam around it. And those are just
two of the things that make this Native American resort, the offspring of a
marriage between the Maricopa and Pima Indians and the corporate
American Sheraton, unique. The elders of the two tribes that coexist on
the huge Gila River Indian reservation, just off I-10 south of Phoenix, over-
saw all the resort’s details — golf club, spa, equestrian center, and fine-
dining restaurant, Kai (see “A taste of Native America” sidebar later in this
chapter). On-site activities for kids are painlessly educational, and the 2006
addition of the Rawhide Western Town to the property means even more
fun for young’uns. In the event that you want to leave the premises, free-
way proximity makes the resort fairly convenient to the airport and Valley
attractions.

The Westin Kierland Resort & Spa
$$$$$
North Phoenix
Although the Westin has a Phoenix address, that’s just a technicality:
You’re right across the road from Scottsdale, the resort’s spiritual (or
should I say materialist) home. This place debuted in late 2002, and boasts
all the usual recreational facilities, right on the doorstep of the equally
young and still growing Kierland Commons retail and restaurant complex.
The Westin takes advantage of its gorgeous desert setting with striking
architecture and (gracefully) themed areas that allude to Arizona’s history.
And the fine dining room, Deseo (see the “Dining Out” section later in this
chapter), adds a touch of Latin spice.

Downtown Scottsdale
A longtime local favorite for its great downtown Scottsdale location, lushly
landscaped grounds (including an inviting lagoon-style pool complex), and
low rates, this miniresort underwent a megabucks renovation in the early
2000s. Upgrades — including the addition of a small spa and guestroom
features like marble sinks and large screen TVs — were followed by (nat-
urally) a rate hike, a name change (from Sunburst), and, in 2006, an acqui-
sition by the Kimpton group, known for its boutique hotels in the
Northwest. Look for lots of individualized specials geared toward pet-
owners, women, women pet-owners, etc. Being able to park near your
room is a nice touch, as is the free shuttle service to and from nearby
shops and nightspots (it’s nice to know your vehicle is close by — and
even nicer to know you don’t have to use it).

Clarendon Hotel + Suites
$$–$$$ Central Phoenix
It’s that ’70s hotel! The recent reinvention of a central Phoenix high-rise as
one of the hippest spots to lay your head is part of the Valley’s ongoing
hotel recycling trend. The building’s boxy structure is oh-so-retro, but such
in-room touches as art panels cum blackout shades, luxe bedding, and cof-
feemakers complete with shade-grown coffee — not to mention free high-
speed wireless Internet — are very 2000s. Camus, the hotel’s L.A.-chic
dining room and bar, gets mixed reviews on its food, but it’s a great place
to have a dirty martini and discuss existentialism. Entertainers performing
at the downtown arenas often lodge here — and their fans can afford the
room rates, too.

In Tempe, where the open wallets of separation anxiety–prone parents

plimentary local phone calls, free transfers to the airport, and in-room
refrigerators, but you never think discount when you’re lounging around

airy, Desert Deco–style room (all recently refurbished).

Built by cowboy artist Lon Megargee as a home and studio in 1930 and

artist than of the cowboy. True, the inn is as Western as all get out, with
stuccoed adobe walls and rough-hewn beams, but the gardens are lovely
and the rooms are frequently refurbished for comfort and style. Lon’s (see
the “Dining Out” section later in this chapter) is hugely popular Valleywide,
but guests get first dibs on tables. Located in a posh town between

Hotel Valley Ho
$$$
Downtown Scottsdale
What goes around comes around. Like bell-bottoms and Jell-O salad, this
1950s hotel classic has resurfaced in the new millennium. And how sweet
it is! I love the sleek turquoise accents and perky bubble patterns in the
rooms, not to mention the flat-screen TVs and single-cup coffeemakers.
Rooms can be noisy, though; ask for one in the back, with the patio or bal-
cony facing the courtyard. The updated comfort food at Cafe Zazu isn’t
always consistent; maybe Trader Vic’s, the hotel’s nod to Polynesian retro
chic, will set hearts (and pu pu platters) afire. If not, you’re within walking
distance of lots of other eateries, as well as shops and galleries.

was rebranded with the incontestably hip Mondrian moniker. The result-

an outdoor yoga space. Other assets include Wi-Fi service pretty much
everywhere on the grounds and, within walking distance, the abundant

Egyptian palms for which it’s named, vie for your attention with the stun-
ning Mediterranean-by-way-of-Mexico rooms. T Cook’s (see the “Dining
Out” section later in this chapter) has some of the most coveted tables in
town, as does the adjacent lounge. To remain competitive in its price cat-
egory, the Royal Palms recently opened a new spa, but (name notwith-
standing) it didn’t turn this property into a real resort — which I consider

Dining Out
Greater Phoenix has grown both up and out in recent years, making this
former cow town a now town, replete with trendy restaurants of every
stripe and watering holes for bucks-up tourists, local glitterati, and
nationally known celebrities, who — like many average folk — can’t get
enough of the golf courses and great weather.
When you come, leave behind any preconceptions you may have about
hotel dining rooms. A large part of the Valley’s economy is driven by the
influx of visitors from all over the country — make that, the world. To
compete for business in this heated market, the major hotels and
resorts have scrambled to create top-notch dining experiences, includ-
ing drop-dead-gorgeous rooms presided over by celebrity chefs. In addi-
tion to the resort and hotel restaurants listed in the following reviews, I
also recommend elements ($$$$$) at Sanctuary and Marquesa ($$$$$)
at the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess, two romantic dining rooms with
very good — and pricey — food. (See the “Staying in Style” section ear-
lier in this chapter for the locations of these properties.)
Forget, too, the idea that malls are bereft of restaurants with character.
You find some of the Valley’s best food in strip malls and upscale retail
emporia. Of course, Greater Phoenix also abounds with chain restau-
rants, ranging from fast-food drive-ups to tony steakhouses, with
pseudo-ethnic eateries like the homegrown P.F. Chang’s and Kona Grill in
between. If you have favorites, chances are good you can find them in
the Valley. My personal picks in the mid-range chain category are Sam’s
Café, with Valley locations that include the Arizona Center and Biltmore
Fashion Park in Phoenix; and Z’ Tejas Grill in Scottsdale Fashion Square
(see the “Shopping the Local Stores” section later in this chapter, for all
three). These two chains serve zesty Southwestern food in a casual
atmosphere, and both are Texas imports — so at least they come by
their Southwestern culinary credentials honestly.
A gourmet meal around Phoenix isn’t exactly cheap. On the other hand,
the tab is a bargain compared to the cost of similar restaurants in other
major cities, and you can get just about everything here that you can
there — except during late-night hours. Prime table time is about 7:30
p.m. If you want to eat at 8:30 or 9 p.m., you should have no trouble get-
ting a reservation, but many restaurants close by 10:30 p.m. For some
Part III: Exploring the Big Cities 
118

that don’t, see the “Lounges and wine bars” section in the “Living It Up
After Dark” section of this chapter.
Note: Two of the Valley’s latest hot spots, Bodega Bistro ($$–$$$), a wine
and tapas bar, and Binkley’s ($$$$), boasting a chef who worked in 
the Bay Area’s French Laundry, are way up north in Cave Creek. If you
don’t mind driving, or are staying in one of the northern resorts near
Scottsdale Boulevard — Westin Kierland, Scottsdale Princess, and espe-
cially The Boulders — then both are definitely worth a try.

Not too far north, not too far south, this light, contemporary-chic room
serving light, contemporary-chic food is a nice lunch stop if you find your-
self at the Shops at Gainey Village or other outdoor mall in this part of

of lamb, but Bloom really shines with salads such as spinach with glazed
pecans and gorgonzola, appetizers like smoked salmon on a warm potato
galette, and entrees such as ahi tuna with sweet plum glaze. And the
desserts! You might want to skip the real food altogether and just get a
midday surge with a cup of coffee and the Bars of Sin.

Central Phoenix
AMERICAN
Chelsea’s is where the locals from the posh Arcadia neighborhood come
when they — and their kids — want comfort food that’s not fast food (at
least not in concept; though service can actually be a bit rushed because
the joint is so popular). Short-rib hash and fried chicken are among the
tasty “American roadhouse” specialties; I’m not sure that duck tacos fall
into that category, but who cares when they’re so delicious!? Cushy booths
and brick walls add to the comfortable roadhouse feel. A patio overlook-
ing the Arizona Canal is very pleasant in winter, but the lack of misting
makes it too toasty to enjoy in summer.

SOUTHWESTERN/ITALIAN
Goofily decorated with Mardi Gras beads and a bright blue star-spangled
ceiling, this former art gallery is one of Scottsdale’s hippest (and friend-
liest) downtown retreats. Locals drop by for wine flights and a menu that
successfully pairs Southwestern ingredients with Italian specialties. Menu
standouts include the Stetson chopped salad, pork rib stuffed with blue
cheese, and the exotic mushroom pan fry, the restaurant’s signature dish.
Save room for the warm, praline-sauced bread pudding.

BURGERS/SANDWICHES
Cheeseburger, cheeseburger, cheeseburger, as the old John Belushi rou-
tine on SNL used to go . . . But these burgers, served with sweet-potato
fries in a little metal shopping cart — an allusion to the posh shopping in
surrounding Biltmore? — are far more haute than those in any Greek coffee
shop. So are the imported beers, available in sampler sizes from the bar
menu. This super popular spot is L.A.-chic but not big-city intimidating —
in fact, if you’re on your own, just grab a seat at the community table 
and chow down. (And, yes, if you must, you can get a salad here instead
of big meat.)

NUEVO LATINO
At his hugely successful Miami restaurant, chef Douglas Rodriguez prac-
tically invented the genre known as Nuevo Latino. Now visitors to the
Westin Kierland Resort’s stylish main dining room can also savor
Rodriguez’s dazzling South and Central American–inspired cooking. You
can’t go wrong with any of the ceviche appetizers, and the rack of lamb
with pistachios and mint (no, not in a jelly) ranks high on my favorite
entrees list. Save room for one of the desserts, like the super rich, super
delicious dulce de leche fondue.

ORGANIC
This 12-acre organic farm complex in South Phoenix — on land originally
owned by the Heards of Heard Museum fame — offers a veritable cornu-
copia of dining experiences — all with an emphasis on fresh, local, organic
ingredients. Munch out on a picnic table under spreading pecan trees at
the Farm Kitchen ($) or Morning Glory Cafe ($–$$); the former is known
for its omelets and baked goods, the latter for creative salads and sand-
wiches. Or go gourmet indoors at Quiessence Restaurant and Wine Bar
($$$), where seasonally changing lunches and dinners are prepared in the
open kitchen of a wonderful old farm house. A spring menu might offer
items such as hazelnut pesto, ravioli of spring vegetables, and beef ten-
derloin served with lemon asparagus risotto.

A taste of Native America
Two Valley restaurants on opposite ends of the price, ambience, and gourmet-
aspiration spectrum have one thing in common: They give you a chance to sample the
cuisine of Arizona’ s first residents, or at least a version of it. After you get a taste of
the specialty that gives the Tohono O’odham–owned Fry Bread House ($) 4140 N. 7th
Ave., Phoenix (% 602-351-2345) its name, you won’t care that you’re sitting in a
Formica booth under fluorescent lights. You’ll be too busy savoring the huge piece of
fresh-out-of-the-fryer dough, topped with everything from powdered sugar or honey
to chopped beef, cheese, and lettuce. See map p. 120.
In contrast, Kai ($$$$), the fine-dining room at Sheraton Wild Horse Pass Resort (see
the “Staying in Style” section earlier in this chapter), applies the talents of a James
Beard award-winner (Janos Wilder, who created the menu) and a Native American
(Jack Strong, the Chef de Cuisine, who has a background in fine dining and commu-
nity outreach) to food raised by the Pima and Maricopa tribes, who own the restau-
rant and the resort that hosts it. You’ll be dining on the likes of rack of lamb with
cornbread pudding or pecan-crusted chicken with chayote squash in the stylish
dining room or on the chic mountain-view patio. See map p. 120.

The Greene House/North
$$$
North Scottsdale
NEW AMERICAN/ITALIAN
I wouldn’t ordinarily group such different restaurants together but these
two share the same building in bustling Kierland Commons mall, as well as
the same creator — young restaurateur Sam Fox, whose uniformly good
Valley enterprises include Bloom, listed earlier in this section, and Sauce,
noted in the “Designer Pies” sidebar. My personal preference is the slightly
upscale Greene House, with the clean lines of its Craftsman-style dining
room and its California-influenced menu highlighting fresh ingredients and
culinary creativity in such entrees as Pacific cod with candied porcini
mushrooms. North is also creative, offering thin-crust pizzas and well-prepared
versions of Italian staples like osso buco and chicken parmesan, which are
served from an open kitchen into a brick-walled dining room with exposed
duct ceiling.
Two caveats: Another thing these restaurants share is the restroom, and
you have to go outdoors to get to it. Also, the noise level is high in both
dining rooms, in that annoyingly chic way.
See map p. 120. The Greene House, 15024 N. Scottsdale Rd. % 480-889-9494. Main
courses: $9–$15 lunch; $19–$38 dinner. North, 14024 N. Scottsdale Rd. % 480-

Tempe 
NEW AMERICAN
Escape from the bustle of Mill Avenue into this cozy retreat consisting of
two teeny cottages built in the early 1900s. Sip raspberry-infused lemon-
ade and munch housemade quiche at lunchtime on the lovely outdoor
garden patio. If there’s an evening chill (hey, it happens), grab a table
indoors to enjoy an intimate dinner of, say, macadamia-crusted ahi or
lasagna with sun-dried tomato basil pesto. Service can be spotty, but the
atmosphere is welcoming; and the setting will charm your socks off.

Paradise Valley
NEW AMERICAN
Named for cowboy artist Lon Megargee, who built an adobe ranch house
on this spot in the 1930s (see the “Staying in Style” section earlier in this
chapter), this low-ceilinged, Southwestern artifact–furnished restaurant is
a perfect example of rustic Arizona charm. But the sophisticated menu
wasn’t designed with the cowboy in mind, except for the hearty portion
sizes. The “artful American cuisine” focuses on the organic, the humanely
raised, and the ecologically sound — so, you don’t have to feel guilty about

what you eat, just how much of it. Leave your Stetson at home and try the
pepper-crusted pork tenderloin with prickly pear–braised red cabbage or
pecan-grilled vegetable and mushroom tortellini. Ask for a table on one of
two fabulous patios for lunch or Sunday brunch.

A sumptuous decor, elegant service, and twinkling views of the city lights
by night make this high-up, haute spot tops for a money-is-no-object spe-
cial occasion. Come here to remember why lobster, foie gras, truffles,
caviar, and the like, all of which rotate onto the weekly tasting menu,
became hallmarks of fine dining in the first place. Expect to spend a small
fortune — unless you sit in the lounge, and have the tasting menu of arti-
sanal cheeses ($30) — but leave completely wowed. Chef de Cuisine

A Mexican lexicon
Phoenix has more Mexican restaurants than you can shake a taco at, which makes
selecting just one a difficult task. You find upscale dining rooms featuring cuisine from
all parts of Mexico; old-fashioned local standbys serving down-home dishes from
Sonora (Mexico’s northernmost state, which borders Arizona); and corporate opera-
tions geared toward gringos (skip those). Here are some of my favorite spots to savor
south-of-the-border fare.
 Barrio Café ($$–$$$), 2814 N. 16th St., south of Thomas Road, Phoenix (% 602-
636-0240), provides a colorful, artful venue for its colorful, artful menu, which ven-
tures far south into Mexico and to that country’s coasts. Find everything here from
chiles stuffed with chicken, pecans, apricots, and pears to Baja-style fish tacos.
See map p. 120.
 Carolina’s ($), 1202 E. Mohave St., at 12th Street, South Phoenix (% 602-252-1503),
has locals lining up by 11:30 on any weekday morning, waiting patiently for a crack
at the simple Sonoran food. Ambience is nonexistent, but who cares when you
can eat homemade tortillas still warm from the griddle? See map p. 120.

North Scottsdale
NEW AMERICAN/NORTHERN ITALIAN
The long drive to this lovely restaurant, which boasts a romantic patio and
a spectacular indoor waterfall, not to mention memorable food prepared by
chef/owner Michael DeMaria, is well worth your time. Customers ooh and
ahh over the edible-spoon hors d’oeuvres (the spoon itself is made of puff
pastry) and such seasonal dishes as rosemary-scented lamb chops with
goat cheese lasagna and pesto-glazed salmon. The Sunday brunch is superb.
See map p. 120. 8700 E. Pinnacle Peak Rd. (at Pima Road). % 480-515-2575.

 La Hacienda ($$$), Fairmont Scottsdale Princess Resort, 7575 E. Princess Dr., north
of Bell Road, east of Scottsdale Road, North Scottsdale (% 480-585-4848), is
sumptuously decorated and decidedly expensive, but you won’t find its regional
Mexican specialties anywhere else. Roast suckling pig (carved tableside) and the
mushroom and goat cheese quesadilla filled with glistening huitlacoche (the
Mexican equivalent of truffles) are just two exotic examples. See map p. 120.
 Los Olivos ($$), 7328 E. 2nd St. at Scottsdale Road, Downtown Scottsdale (% 480-
946-2256), has been around since the art in the nearby downtown Scottsdale gal-
leries was affordable. Come to enjoy not only a slice of history but also depend-
ably good Sonoran-style staples: green-corn tamales, chicken enchiladas, and
the like. See map p. 120.
 Los Sombreros ($$), 2534 N. Scottsdale Rd., south of Thomas, South Scottsdale
(% 480-994-1799), ranges all over the map of Mexico for such savory dishes as
mole poblano and Yucatan-style slow-roasted pork with tomatillo-chipotle sauce.
Other pluses: a kicked-back patio and a nice list of mezcals (not one with a worm
in it!). See map p. 120.
 Mariscos Playa Hermosa ($$), 1605 E. Garfield St., between McDowell and Van
Buren, Central Phoenix (% 602-462-1563), is a sunny, beach-themed cafe with
zesty seafood cocktails, meals-in-themselves soups, and delicious entrees such
as Verucruz-style, red-snapper-and-shrimp Fantasia, wrapped in bacon and
smothered with cheese. See map p. 120.
 The New El Portal ($–$$), 117 W. Grant St., near 2nd Avenue, Phoenix (% 602-
271-0521), is a magnet for local movers and shakers, who come more for the great
carne asada (grilled meat) tacos and red chile burritos than for the atmosphere.
Get here before noon if you don’t want a long wait. See map p. 120.
 Pepe’s Taco Villa ($–$$), 2108 W. Camelback Rd., at 21st Street, east of Highway
51, Phoenix (% 602-242-0379), run by a family from Monterrey, dishes up albondi-
gas (meatballs) on Friday, carnitas (braised pork), and short ribs just like the
Mexican grandma you never had used to make. See map p. 120.

Rancho Pinot Grill
$$$
Scottsdale
NEW AMERICAN
What do you get when you cross funky cowboy-kitsch decor with a menu
that’s hip but homey? This warm, inviting place, which is often booked
solid in the winter months, and for good reason. Chef/owner Chrysa
Kaufman’s exotic mesquite-grilled shrimp with Thai slaw and mango relish
is justifiably famous, and the strip steak with portabellas and pancetta is
equally delicious. Check out the great wine list, and don’t skip dessert
either.

Scottsdale
WESTERN AMERICAN
Chef/owner and ex-Texan Robert McGrath dishes up his own brand of
hearty but haute Western American cuisine to urbane cowfolk. Patrons
stampede to the airy, light dining rooms for the chile-cured duck breast or
terrific short ribs (served with cheese grits). Be prepared to do battle to
get a table in the more casual “saloon” ($$) section during happy hour;
this is a favorite spot to meet after work for a huckleberry margarita and
green chile pork stew or a “Big-Ass” burger (a bargain at just $8).

ITALIAN
Q: Why drive all the way up to North Scottsdale to dine? A: This series of
gorgeous rooms in an Italian villa–style building, a dramatic mountain
backdrop, a stellar wine list, friendly but professional service, and — oh,
yeah — great food, created by Moises Wade, who cooked under Mario
Batali at New York’s Lupa. Highlights for me were the grilled broccoli rabe
sprinkled with pepper oil and the crunchy green beans with pine nuts
antipasti; the house-made gnocchi with wild mushrooms; and the seasonal
fish steamed in paper. Indecisive? Just put yourself in the chef’s hands for
a tasting menu. You won’t regret it.

JAPANESE/SUSHI

room, nibbling seared tuna tataki and discussing wine vintages. Even those

Designer pies
You want a pretty place with atmosphere where you can get a glass of wine and a
salad; your companion wants hearty food that won’t break the bank. No problem.
Upscale pizzerias that satisfy all appetites abound around Greater Phoenix. All the fol-
lowing restaurants fall into the $$ price category.
 Cibo, 603 N. 5th Ave., at Fillmore Street, downtown Phoenix (% 602-441-2697),
serves up thin-crust pies in a twinkly, romantic house in the heart of the Roosevelt
historic district. Split the Antipasto Speciale — fresh cheeses, dried meats, and
roasted veggies — then move on to a savory red or white pizza. If there’s room,
the Nutella-filled crepe is a delight.
 Grazie, 6952 E. Main St., at Goldwater Road, downtown Scottsdale, (% 480-
663-9797), dishes up serious pizzas — for example, the “Complimenti alla Mama,”
topped with mozzarella, ricotta, Italian ham, and salami — and calzones, includ-
ing a dessert version filled with chocolate, hazelnut, and bananas, topped with
vanilla ice cream. The patio is particularly mellow.
 La Grand Orange, 4410 N. 40th St., at Campbell Avenue, central Phoenix, (% 602-
840-7777), is a counter-service, take-away cafe by day, but transforms into a can-
dlelit pizza restaurant by night. The white wine sangria is a nice complement to
thin-crust pies like the Mushroom Party, with sautéed crimini, button, and oyster
mushrooms, or the Gladiator, a red-sauced protein storm of Schreiner’s sausage
and pepperoni.
 Pizzeria Bianco, 623 E. Adams St., just west of 7th Street, downtown Phoenix, 
(% 602-258-8300), boasts a James Beard award-winning chef, Chris Bianco, the
restaurant’s namesake. His terrific salads, antipastos, and wood-fired pizzas
(among them, the “Wiseguy,” topped with fennel sausage and house-smoked
mozzarella) are made with top-notch, often organic, ingredients. The bad news:
Housed in a tiny 1927 house near the ballpark, the place is often packed, espe-
cially on game nights.
 Sauce, 742 East Glendale Ave., at N. 7th Street, central Phoenix, (% 602-216-
2400), has perfected the recipe for success: a few creative pizzas, panini, and
chopped salads; a few nice wines by the glass; and a pared-down, but cheery
room. For additional locations in Scottsdale and Mesa, see www.foxrestaurant
concepts.com/sauce.html.

who don’t like fish in any form will find plenty to savor here, including a
dazzling creamy edamame soup. Dishes are reasonably priced but fairly
small, so the tab can add up quickly; if you plan to splurge anyway, go for
the tasting menu ($125), which pairs Fukuda’s fish and wine selections.
See map p. 120. 7133 E. Stetson Dr. (just north of 6th Avenue). % 480-481-WINE.
Reservations strongly recommended. Main courses: $8–$18. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V.
Dinner nightly.
T Cook’s
$$$$
Central Phoenix
MEDITERRANEAN
For comfort and elegance, nobody does it better than T Cook’s, a lush hide-
away with Mediterranean accents. I’ve always liked the atmosphere a bit
more than the food — especially recently, when there’s been lots of chef
turnover — but sometimes you can get a stellar meal here. Mussels with
garlic saffron sauce make a great starter; for an entree, try scallops with
squash custard or spit-roasted chicken with dried fruit. Finish off your
evening with port and piano music in the cozy adjoining lounge.
See map p. 120. 4800 N. Scottsdale Rd. (at Chaparral). % 602-808-0766. Reservations
recommended. Main courses: $24–$33. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V. Breakfast, lunch, and
dinner daily; Sunday brunch.
Vu
$$$$
North Scottsdale
NEW AMERICAN
Tired of those menus that you need cryptography training to decode? You
know, the ones that allude to cooking techniques you’ve never heard of
and ingredients that sound made-up? Vu eliminates all that stress with a
beautifully simple menu that just lists basic components of appetizers and
entrees — turbot/rhubarb/cucumbers/basil, say — and possible sides
(fava beans, perhaps, or gnocchi). You tell the server if there’s anything
you’re allergic to or just plain dislike. Then the kitchen works its magic.
The setting is enchanted, too, resembling a swanky supper club with a
view (yes, that’s how the restaurant’s name is pronounced, perhaps the
only annoying pretension here) of the resort’s lagoon.
See map p. 120. 7500 E. Doubletree Ranch Rd. in the Hyatt Regency Scottsdale (east
at Scottsdale Road). % 480-991-3388. Reservations recommended. Main courses:
$24–$32 dinner. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V. Dinner nightly.
Zinc Bistro

North Scottsdale
FRENCH
What a neat trick, transporting an authentic French bistro to a North
Scottsdale mall. The details are perfect, from the etched-glass windows
and brass wall sconces in the bustling, airy dining rooms right down to
menu items such as onion soup gratinée and chocolate soufflé. You can
Chapter 11: Phoenix, Scottsdale, and the Valley of the Sun 129

easily make a meal of those two, with a side of knockout pomme frites
(french fries). Slaves to nutrition may want to try the wine-steamed 
mussels or the deliciously simple roast chicken. Now if only the view from
the pretty terrace was of the Champs-Élysée rather than of yet another
Scottsdale megaboutique.

Great cowtown steaks
Greater Phoenix may have shed many of its (literal) cowtown ways — back in the old
days you could smell the stockyards from the airport — but its residents are still seri-
ous carnivores. High-end steakhouses abound in the Valley. In addition to corporate
favorites like Ruth’s Chris and Morton’s, you find many independents that are capable
of properly aging, cutting, and cooking USDA prime. Nor has the town lost its fond-
ness for cowboy steaks, grilled over a mesquite fire and served in down-home quar-
ters. Here’s one meat-lover’s vote for the top spots to wield a steak knife (see also
Rawhide in the “Kids Corner” sidebar later in this chapter):
 Don & Charlie’s ($$$$), 7501 E. Camelback Rd., east of Scottsdale Road, Scottsdale
(% 480-990-0900), is one of the city’s most popular restaurants, mainly for its prime
steaks, grilled until they’ve got a good char around the edges. See map p. 120.
 Drinkwater’s City Hall Steakhouse ($$$$), 6991 E. Camelback Rd., at Goldwater
Road, downtown Scottsdale (% 480-941-4700), is a swanky spot to swill some
single malts and tuck into a filet mignon — and maybe make some business or
romantic contacts. The service and food quality are commensurate with the
prices. See map p. 120.
 Durant’s ($$$$), 2611 N. Central Ave., just south of Thomas, central Phoenix 
(% 602-264-5967), is Phoenix’s favorite old-timer, where local movers and shak-
ers come for martinis, great steaks, and a look at each other. See map p. 120.
 Pinnacle Peak Patio ($$–$$$), 10426 E. Jomax Rd., north Scottsdale (% 480-
585-1599), is, after half a century, still the number-one tourist destination for green-
horns hungry for mesquite-grilled steak and a taste of the cowboy life. Wear boots
and dance to country bands; wear a necktie and the staff cuts it off and hangs 
it on the wall with your business card. And don’t hesitate to bring the kids. See
map p. 120.
 T-Bone ($$–$$$), 10037 S. 19th Ave., at Dobbins Road, Phoenix (% 602-276-0945),
at the foot of South Mountain, offers up Old-West ambience with an urban
panorama . . . of the Phoenix skyline. Park your hide — or your ride; one horseback
riding outfitter brings you down the mountain at dinnertime — at a picnic table
and kick back as a holstered server brings mesquite-grilled meat. See map p. 120.

Exploring Phoenix, Scottsdale, 
and the Valley of the Sun
The Valley generally enjoys such pleasant weather that many of the best
ways to spend your days are listed in this chapter’s “Staying Active” sec-
tion. What follows are the top indoor diversions and ways to play outdoors
that don’t (delibersately) involve sweat.
The top attractions
Arizona Science Center
Downtown Phoenix
The ultimate kids’ playscape, with two floors of supercool exhibits,
includes a giant sneezing nose and a Fab Lab where you can shoot paper
airplanes. You also find a state-of-the-art planetarium and a large-screen
Iwerks theater. But you don’t have to be pint-size — or a geek — to get a
kick out of this place. Valley grown-ups liked it so much that they
demanded — and got — their own time here on the first Friday night of
every month. If you’re doing the whole shebang — planetarium + film +
exhibits — allot a full morning or afternoon. If not, allow at least two hours
anyway; this place is tough to tear your kids (and yourself) away from.
Instead of trolling around for parking, pull into the Heritage and Science
Park garage on the corner of Fifth and Monroe streets, where fees are dis-
counted if you get your ticket validated at the science center.
See map p. 132. 600 E. Washington St. (at 7th Street). % 602-716-2000. www.az
science.org. Exhibits admission: $9 adults, $7 children ages 3–12 and seniors over
62. Planetarium admission: $5 adults, $4 children and seniors. Theater admission: 
$7 adults, $6 children and seniors. Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.; closed Thanksgiving and
Christmas.
Desert Botanical Garden
Phoenix (Papago Park)
Wondering about all those weird prickly things you keep seeing? You’re
still filled with wonder after examining some of the 20,000 types of desert
plants gathered here from around the world, but you’re armed (sometimes
multiarmed) with a lot more information. The ethnobotany displays on the
Plants & People of the Sonoran Desert Trail, for example, detail how the
native peoples of this area turned the local flora into everything from food
to shoes. Don’t miss two very colorful, attractions: the butterfly pavilion
and a 1⁄3-mile desert wildlife trail that’s blooming beautiful (in season); a
map of the trail is available online or at the garden.

Wear comfortable shoes; you do a lot of walking, especially if you want to
cover the two side trails. Wandering the grounds at a leisurely pace takes
a minimum of two hours, but you can duck into the Succulent House and
Cactus House and loop back to the entrance and gift shop in 45 minutes if
you’re pressed for time.
See map p. 132. 1201 N. Galvin Pkwy. (south of McDowell Road, west of Scottsdale
Road). % 480-941-1225. www.dbg.org. Admission: $10 adults, $9 seniors, $5 stu-
dents with ID, $4 ages 3–12, free ages 2 and under. Oct–April daily 8a.m.–8 p.m.;
May–Sept daily 7 a.m.–8 p.m.; closed July 4th, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.
Heard Museum
Downtown Phoenix
A must-see. Established in a gracious Spanish Colonial–style house in 1929,
the Heard has long been one of the country’s best museums devoted to
the native peoples of the Southwest, and it just keeps getting better. No
dusty pot shards here: Contemporary, sometimes provocative, Native
American art shares space with exhibits devoted to the cultures and crafts
of the past, and hands-on, interactive displays entertain kids. On fine days,
you can take advantage of the wonderful outdoor sculpture garden.
If you factor in time for browsing the huge, impossible-to-resist gift shop
(see the “Shopping the Local Stores” section later in this chapter), figure
on a full morning or afternoon here. The Heard Museum North and the new
Heard Museum West (opened June 2006) are equally terrific, if on a much
smaller scale.
See map p. 132. 2301 N. Central Ave. (4 blocks north of McDowell Road, on the east
side of Central Avenue). % 602-252-8848. www.heard.org. Admission: $10 adults,
$9 seniors, $5 students with I.D., $3 ages 6–12, under 6 and Native Americans free.
Guided docent tours included in admission price given noon, 1:30 p.m. and 3 p.m.
Daily 9:30 a.m.–5 p.m.; closed major holidays. The Heard Museum North is in the El
Pedregal complex, 34505 N. Scottsdale Rd., Scottsdale. % 480-488-9817. Admission:
Free (donation suggested). Daily 9:30a.m.–5 p.m. The Heard Museum West is in the
West Valley town of Surprise, 16126 N. Civic Center Plaza. %. 623-344-2200. Admission:
$5 adults; $4 senior 55 and over, $2 ages 18 and under. Tues–Sun 9:30am–5pm. 
Phoenix Art Museum
Downtown Phoenix (North)
One of the Southwest’s largest art museums, this is the venue that hosts
all the major shows from out of town. The two low-slung boxes and a con-
necting patio that comprise the museum complex are open and attractive,
and the permanent collection is strong in modern and Western art; the
miniatures are a particular treat. To be honest, aside from special shows
and events (such as the annual Cowboy Artists of America exhibition and
sale in the fall), this museum isn’t really a must-see unless you’re visiting
from an art-deprived city or experiencing culture shock. Still, you find
plenty here to hold your attention for a few hours or so; and, on Sunday,
free lectures and presentations may keep you occupied even longer.

See map p. 132. 1625 N. Central Ave. (at Coronado Road). % 602-257-1222. www.phx

ages 5 and under. Free admission on Thurs. Tues–Wed and Fri–Sun 10 a.m.–5 p.m.;
Thurs 10 a.m.–9 p.m.; closed Mon and major holidays.
Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art
Scottsdale (near Old Town)
For an “outpost” art museum to impress an ex-Manhattanite like me isn’t
easy, but I’m crazy about this place. It’s fun and provocative, and it has a
great venue, a former discount movie theater that artist Will Bruder cre-
atively converted into an art space (see the “Architect trek: The next gen-
eration[s]” sidebar in this chapter). Rotating exhibits highlight architecture
and design along with painting, sculpture, and things less classifiable — for
example, preview exhibits from Roden Crater, an extinct volcano being
turned into artwork by James Turrell. The museum isn’t all that large; you
can see everything in an hour or so. One bonus: Just across Drinkwater
Boulevard, at Scottsdale Civic Center Mall, you can view 13 modern sculp-
tures, including Robert Indiana’s red LOVE, an icon of the 1960s.
See map p. 132. 7374 E 2nd St. (at Drinkwater Boulevard). % 480-994-2787. www.
scottsdalearts.org. Admission: $7 adults, $5 students, free ages 15 and under;
free for all on Thurs. Fall–spring Tues–Wed and Fri–Sat 10 a.m.–5 p.m., Thurs 
10 a.m.–8 p.m., Sun noon–5 p.m., closed Mon; summer Wed and Sun noon–5 p.m.,
Thurs 10 a.m.–8 p.m., Fri–Sat 10 a.m.–5 p.m.; closed Mon–Tues and all major holi-
days.
Taliesin West
North Scottsdale
You don’t have to be an architecture buff to want to head out to the winter
home, studio, and architectural “laboratory” that were the domain of
America’s master builder, Frank Lloyd Wright, from 1937 until his death in
1959. Often ranked among Wright’s top designs, Taliesin West is now a
National Historic Landmark. From the early days, showing the public
around the grounds was part of the training program for the apprentices
at the (still operating) Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture. The
desert may not be as pristine as it was when Wright ruled here — he was

Cafe culture
Three of Phoenix’s top attractions, the Desert Botanical Garden, the Heard Museum,
and the Phoenix Art Museum, feature Arcadia Farms cafes, branches of a Scottsdale
restaurant known for its creative salads and sandwiches. So you won’t go wrong,
food-wise, if you plan your museum visit to overlap with lunchtime. These restaurants
are very popular, though, so you may have a wait on weekends.

so irate over the few power lines that went up in the 1950s that he built
his living room to face away from them — but as the excellent architec-
tural tours and the Wright-o-bilia sold at the gift shop attest, the architect’s
work and principles are as vital as ever.
See map p. 132. 12621 Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd. (approximately 114th Street at Cactus
Road). % 480-860-8810 (tour information) or 480-860-2700 (general information and
directions). www.franklloydwright.org. Admission: Taliesin West offers five
different guided tours (the only way to see the grounds), which vary depending on the
season. They range from the 90-minute standard (“Panorama”) tours, offered year-
round ($18.50 adults; $16 seniors, students, and military; $10 ages 4–12) to a three-
hour “Behind the Scenes” tour ($45 per person in winter; $35 in summer). If you’re in
town on Thurs or Fri nights, May–Sept, don’t miss the two-hour “Night Lights on the
Desert” tour ($25 person). Visitor center/gift shop Sept–June daily 8:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m.;
closed Tues and Wed July–Aug and Easter, Thanksgiving, and New Year’s Day. Tour
times and frequency depend on season. Call ahead — but you can expect something
every day starting at 9 a.m.
More cool things to see and do
Additional attractions in Greater Phoenix range from a gem of a museum
good for whittling away an hour or two to a city where you can easily
devote several days.
 Mine the state’s past: The early adventurers and investors who
came to Arizona in droves learned the hard way that all that glitters
isn’t gold; you get a far less stressful version of that lesson at the
small Arizona Mining and Mineral Museum, 1502 W. Washington
St., at 15th Avenue (% 602-255-3791; www.admmr.state.az.us).
Whether you’re interested in mines or mining, these rocks and gem-
stones are mighty pretty. Admission is $2; children under age 18 are
free. It’s open Monday through Friday 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Saturday 
11 a.m. to 4 p.m., and closed on state holidays. See map p. 132.
 Get strung along: The Bead Museum, 5754 W. Glenn Dr., at 58th
Avenue, Glendale (% 623-931-2737), is no mere ode to adornment.
Part III: Exploring the Big Cities 
136
From gum to Spam
The Wrigley Mansion, 2501 E. Telawa Trail, Camelback Corridor (% 602-955-4079;
www.wrigleymansionclub.com), a huge Mediterranean residence built between
1929 and 1931 by chewing-gum king William Wrigley Jr., was most recently owned by
Geordie Hormel, whose family made its fortune from Spam. Hormel, an entertainer
who had often played the piano at the mansion’s elaborate Sunday brunch, died in
early 2006. Tour the mansion and see what the wealth from two quintessential
American products created, Tuesday through Friday at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. for $11 per
person. (To find Telawa, turn into the Arizona Biltmore Circle, off 24th Street, between
Missouri and Lincoln.) See map p. 132.

Beads had — and still have — commercial, ceremonial, and religious
purposes, detailed through a variety of beautiful objects from around
the world. You see everything from elaborate headdresses to beads
that were traded for slaves. Crafters can figure out the latest tech-
niques, too. Admission is $4 for adults, $2 for ages 12 and under; free
for all on Thursday from 5p.m. to 8 p.m. It’s open Monday through
Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Thursday 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., and Sunday
from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. See map p. 132.
 Explore Phoenix’s heritage: Heritage Square, 115 N. 6th St., at
Monroe, downtown Phoenix (% 602-262-5029, ext. 1 or 602-262-
5071; www.ci.phoenix.az.us/PARKS/heritage.html), a group of
Victorian-era structures listed on the National Register of Historic
Places, gives a glimpse of an architectural style not generally asso-
ciated with Arizona. The Rosson House is furnished with period
antiques. The Stevens House hosts the Arizona Doll and Toy
Museum (for details, see “The kids’ corner” sidebar later in this
chapter). A tearoom/cafe/gift shop (% 602-252-4682) and Pizzeria
Bianco (see the “Dining Out” section earlier in this chapter) are
also in the complex. Admission to the complex is free; Rosson
House costs $4 for adults, $3 for seniors, $1 for ages 6 to 12, and
free for ages 5 and under. The complex is always open; Rosson
Chapter 11: Phoenix, Scottsdale, and the Valley of the Sun 137
Architect trek: The next generation(s)
Frank Lloyd Wright put his mark on the Valley. In this chapter, you can find information
on his best-known local projects: Scottsdale’s Taliesin West (see the “Exploring
Phoenix, Scottsdale, and the Valley of the Sun” section); Phoenix’s Arizona Biltmore
Hotel (see the “Spending the Night” section), for which Wright was a design consult-
ant; and Tempe’s Grady Gammage Memorial Auditorium at Arizona State University
(see the “More cool things to see and do” section). But Wright also inspired two more
generations of Greater Phoenix space-building pioneers.
You can tour Wright protégé Paolo Soleri’s famed desert community of Arcosanti (see
Chapter 12) and its smaller, Scottsdale prototype, Cosanti (see “The tintinnabulation
of the bells, bells, bells” sidebar in this chapter). Soleri, who was born in 1919, is also
slated to build the Sundial Bridge as part of the Scottsdale Waterfront Project; how-
ever, as of 2006, the funding for the project was stalled.
And Soleri student Will Bruder not only created the Scottsdale Museum of
Contemporary Art (see the “Exploring Phoenix, Scottsdale, and the Valley of the Sun”
section); he’s also responsible for downtown Phoenix’s Burton Barr Central Library,
1221 N. Central Ave., south of McDowell Avenue (% 602-262-4636; www.phoenix
publiclibrary.org), a five-story cube partially covered in copper that’s a real
dazzler at sunset. For a closer look at some of its more unusual features — for exam-
ple, the suspended ceiling in the huge reading room — stop at the directions desk at
the foot of the stairs when you enter and ask for the self-guided tour pamphlet. See
map p. 132.

138
Native Traces
Although Phoenix owes its existence, in part, to the ancient Hohokam Indian irriga-
tion system, traces of Native American culture in the Valley of the Sun are not easy to
find these days. The premier place to find out about the area’s first settlers is the Heard
Museum (see “The Top Attractions” in the previous section), but you also get some
interesting glimpses of past and present native culture from the following sights.
 Deer Valley Rock Art Center, 3711 W. Deer Valley Rd. (2 1⁄2 miles west of I-17 via Exit
215B), Phoenix (% 623-582-8007; www.asu.edu/clas/shesc/dvrac), pre-
serves and interprets the important Hedgpeth Hills archaeological site, where
some of the 1,500 ancient petroglyphs (rock paintings) may date back as far as
5,000 years. Kid-friendly activities include story time, art projects, games for ages
2 through 6, and petroglyph identification. Admission: $5 adults, $3 seniors and
students, $2 ages 6 to 12, children 5 and under free. October through April Tuesday
through Saturday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday noon to 5 p.m., guided tours every
Saturday 10 a.m.; May to September Tuesday Friday 8 a.m. to 2 p.m., Saturday 
9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday noon to 5 p.m.
 Pueblo Grande Museum and Archaeological Park, 4619 E. Washington St. (at 44th
Street in the Papago Salado area), Phoenix (% 877-706-4408 or 602-495-0900;
www.ci.phoenix.az.us/PARKS/pueblo.html), a prehistoric Hohokam
village and associated museum, are sandwiched between several freeways and
in full view of Sky Harbor Airport, offering graphic contrast between the city’s past
and present. Materials revealed during Phoenix’s various excavations — many
necessitated by highway construction — are on display, providing rare insight
into the archaeological process. The real draw, however, is the ruins, which
include a platform mound and an ancient ball court. Admission: $2 adults, $1.50
ages 55 and over, $1 ages 6to 17, free ages 5 and under; free for all Sunday.
Monday through Saturday 9 a.m. to 4:45 p.m., Sunday 1 to 4:45 p.m.
 Huhugam Cultural Center, 4759 N. Maricopa Rd. (1 mile west of I-10, take exit 162),
Chandler (% 520-796-3500; www.huhugam.com), is a project of the Gila River
Indian Community, and, accordingly, was built on their land. It’s still a work in
progress, with erratic hours and exhibits not fully developed, but the building’s
architecture — designed to resemble pot shards set upon a hillside — is spec-
tacular, and the tribe’s basket collection is rare. Though, with all the maintenance,
be sure to call ahead to make sure the center is open. Admission: $5 suggested
donation. Tuesday through Saturday 10am to 4pm.
 Native Trails, Scottsdale Civic Center Mall (2nd Street and Drinkwater Boulevard),
Downtown Scottsdale, is a free program of Native American music, dance, art,
and traditional foods. The Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation and the Scottsdale
Center of the Performing Arts are the sponsors, but the best source of information
is the Scottsdale Convention and Visitors Bureau, % 800-782-1117 or www.
scottsdalecvb.com. Held from noon to 1:30 p.m. most Tuesdays, Thursdays,
and Saturdays from January to April.

House 30-minute tours are Wednesday through Saturday 10 a.m. 
to 4 p.m. and Sunday from noon to 4 p.m., last tour at 3:30 p.m. It’s
closed mid-Aug to Labor Day and major holidays. The tearoom/
cafe/gift shop has hours from Tuesday through Saturday 11 a.m. 
to 4 p.m. and Sunday noon to 4 p.m. See map p. 132.
 Imagine the past: Mystery Castle, 800 E. Mineral Rd. (take Central
Avenue south to the entrance to South Mountain Park; % 602-268-
1581), created by Boyce Gulley in the 1930s and 1940s from local
stones and unusual materials from all around Arizona, is part
medieval fortress, part Old West town. Gulley’s daughter, for whom
the castle was built, still conducts tours of this folk-art phantas-
magoria. Admission is $5 adults, $3 ages 5 to 12, ages 4 and under
free. Hours are Thursday through Sunday 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.; closed
July through September. See map p. 132.
 Talk to the animals: The 125-acre Phoenix Zoo, 455 Galvin Pkwy.,
in Papago Park (% 602-273-1341; www.phoenixzoo.org), stars the
usual animal suspects in their usual re-created habitats. Kids can
get up close and personal with chickens, goats, sheep, and mules at
the 4-acre Harmony Farm. This fine zoo isn’t distinctive enough to
go on the top of a Phoenix tour list. Admission is $14 adults, $9 sen-
iors, $6 ages 3 through 12, and free for ages 2 and under (summer
admission specials are often available). The zoo is open October
through May daily 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; June through September 7 a.m.
to 4 p.m. Saturday through Sunday, 7 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday through
Friday; it’s closed Christmas. See map p. 132.
 Take a trip to Tempe: This pleasant town just east of Phoenix is
home to Arizona State University. On-campus attractions include
the ASU Art Museum, Nelson Fine Arts Center, 10th Street and Mill
Avenue (% 480-965-ARTS; http://asuartmuseum.asu.edu),
where striking, subterranean galleries display contemporary and
Latin American art and some modern American masters (admission
free; winter–spring Wed–Sat, 10 a.m.–5 p.m.; Tues 10 a.m.–9 p.m.;
summer Wed–Sat 10 a.m.–5 p.m.); the Ceramics Research Center
and Gallery, just north of the art museum (% 480-965-2787;
http://asuartmuseum.asu.edu/ceramicsresearchcenter), an
airy, open space featuring contemporary and antique creations of
clay and glaze; and the Grady Gammage Memorial Auditorium,
Gammage Parkway and Mill Avenue (% 480-965-4050; www.asu.
edu/museums/hc/gammage.htm), one of Frank Lloyd Wright’s last
creations, which offers free tours from 1 to 3:30 p.m. during the
school year (may be closed during performance days). For other
Tempe attractions, see the “It’s history” sidebar and sections on
shopping, guided tours, and keeping active — all in this chapter.
The Tempe Convention and Visitors Bureau, 51 W. 3rd St., Suite
#105 (% 800-283-6734 or 480-894-8158; www.tempecvb.com;
Mon–Fri 8 a.m.–5 p.m.), can give you additional information, such
as how to pronounce the town’s name (okay, I’ll tell you myself: It’s
tem-pee). For all locations in Tempe, see map p. 132.
Chapter 11: Phoenix, Scottsdale, and the Valley of the Sun 139

 Mosey on up to Cave Creek. Founded as a mining camp in the
1870s and still capitalizing on its Old West roots — as well as on the
striking volcanic rock formations in the area — this far northern
town is now filled with crafts, souvenir, and antiques shops, plus a
few Western-style saloons. The Cave Creek Museum, 6140 E. Skyline
Dr., at Basin Road (% 480-488-2764; www.cavecreekmuseum.org),
which includes archaeological and pioneer displays, is in a historic
complex that includes the town’s first church, a tuberculosis quar-
antine cabin, and the remains of a mill. Admission is $3 adults, $2
seniors and students, ages 12 and under are free. Hours are October
through May Wednesday to Sunday from 1 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.

The kids’ corner
Greater Phoenix has much to offer to keep the prepubescent set entertained. In addi-
tion to the attractions listed in this sidebar, also check out the Desert Botanical Garden
and the Heard Museum (listed in the “Seeing the Sights” section in this chapter), the
Phoenix Zoo (see the “More cool things to see and do” section), the Phoenix Museum
of History, Arizona Historical Society Museum and the Pioneer Arizona Living History
Museum (in the “It’s history” sidebar later in this section), and the Deer Valley Rock
Art Center (in the “Native Traces” sidebar earlier in this section).
 The Arizona Doll & Toy Museum, 602 E. Adams St., Heritage Square, downtown
Phoenix (% 602-253-9337), has something for all ages and genders, including an
antique, miniature millinery store and candy store with ice cream counter; and an
action-figure exhibit starring GI Joe. Admission: $2.50 adults, $1 children 12 and
under. Tuesday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., Sunday noon to 4 p.m.; closed
August through Labor Day. See map p. 132.
 Hall of Flame Firefighting Museum, 6101 E. Van Buren St., in Papago Park, Phoenix
(% 602-275-3473; www.hallofflame.org), the world’s largest of its type, fea-
tures more than 90 gleaming pieces of fire equipment dating back to 1725. Retired
firefighters often regale visitors with gripping tales of rescue, and kids get to climb
on some of the equipment and (yikes!) even ring alarm bells. Admission: $6 adults,
$5 seniors, $3 ages 6–17, $1.50 ages 3–5, free ages 2 and under. Monday through
Saturday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday noon to 4 p.m.; closed New Year’s Day,
Thanksgiving, and Christmas. See map p. 132.
 Mesa Southwest Museum, 53 N. MacDonald St., at 1st Street, Mesa (% 480-644-
2230; www.mesasouthwestmuseum.com), wraps its learning in a very enter-
taining package, using everything from animated dinosaurs to hands-on gold pan-
ning, to teach kids the history of the Southwest. Rotating exhibits on history and
art cater to adults. Admission: $8 adults, $7 seniors, $6 students 13 and over with
I.D., $3 ages 3 to 12, free ages 2 and under. Tuesday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 
5 p.m., Sun 1 to 5 p.m.; closed Monday and major holidays. See map p. 132.
 McCormick Stillman Railroad Park, 7301 E. Indian Bend Rd., at Scottsdale Road,
Scottsdale (% 480-312-2312; www.therailroadpark.com), is a kick for both

Staying Active
From serene golfing greens to extreme biking terrain, Greater Phoenix
has the means to keep you happily playing outside. But, in case you
hadn’t noticed, Phoenix is in a desert. Bring plenty of water and keep on
drinking it, even if you don’t think you’re thirsty, and even if you don’t
realize you’re sweating. Water evaporates quickly in this dry air. Keeping
hydrated is important for any sport in which you participate, but espe-
cially for the more strenuous ones like hiking and biking.
Biking
Thanks in good part to a large student population, Tempe has more than
150 miles of urban bike paths, making it the Valley’s best — really the
only — in-city biking territory. In addition, a paved, off-street bike path,
as well as a gravel mountain biking path, surround Tempe Town Lake.
You can view a bikeway map on the Web site of the City of Tempe’s
Transit office, 20 E. 6th St. at Mill Avenue, third floor (% 480-350-2775;
www.tempe.gov/tim), or request to have it mailed to you. You can also
pick up a bikeway map at the transit office or at any bike shop in Tempe,
including Tempe Bicycle, 330 W. University and Farmer, 3 blocks west of
Mill Avenue (% 480-966-6896; www.tempebicycle.com), which has a
great selection of road and mountain bikes for rent. Rates range between
$15 and $55 for one day, $30 and $75 for two to three days, and $45 and
$90 for a week. In Scottsdale, the Indian Bend Wash Greenbelt, covering
more than 26 miles along Hayden Road from Shea to where it meets
Tempe Town Lake’s bike path, is popular with pavement-happy bicyclists,
Chapter 11: Phoenix, Scottsdale, and the Valley of the Sun 141
kid and adult rail buffs, who can tootle around the park on a 5⁄12 scale model train.
Two railroad depots and several model trains add to the fun. You also find a 1929
carousel and a general store, where you can buy snacks and souvenirs.
Admission: Free entrance to the grounds; $1 for train and carousel rides, children
under 3 free with a paying adult. Hours vary with the season, so call or visit the
Web site for schedules. See map p. 132.
 Rawhide at Wild Horse Pass, 5700 W. North Loop Rd., take exit 162 from I-10 and
follow signs, Chandler (% 480-502-5600; www.rawhide.com), was always a fun
place for kids to get rowdy in a recreated Western town, but there’s something
oddly appealing — at least for me — about the fact that it’s now owned by Indians,
specifically the Gila River Indian Community, who moved it from North Scottsdale
to their reservation south of Phoenix in 2006. Admission is free but attractions,
from gold panning to stage coach rides, cost anywhere from $2 to $5, so watch
your wallets, pardners. Hours change seasonally, but the town is usually open
nightly from 5 p.m. to 9 or 10 p.m. (when many people come for dinner at the excel-
lent steakhouse, not a lunchtime venue), with daytime hours only on weekends
in spring. See map p. 132.

as well as with joggers and in-line skaters. You can enter the path from
several spots off Hayden Road.
Desert-bound mountain bikers have their pick of dramatic Valley trails.
Arizona Mountain Bike Guide: Fat Tire Tales and Trails, published by

It’s history
Right next to the Arizona Science Center, the Phoenix Museum of History, 105 N. 5th
St., between Monroe and Washington streets, Phoenix (% 602-253-2734; www.pmoh.
org), gives a far from old-fashioned peek into the city’s past. Exhibits include every-
thing from a replica of the beer-bottle sidewalk that fronted one of the city’s saloons
to the ultimate cheap hoosegow (a knee-high rock to which prisoners were chained).
Admission: $6 adults; $4 seniors, students, and military; $3 ages 7 to 12; free ages 6
and under; free on Wednesday from 2 to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 
5 p.m. See map p. 132.
The Arizona Historical Society Museum at Papago Park, 1300 N. College Ave., Tempe
(% 480-929-0292; www.arizonahistoricalsociety.org), covers the entire
state via excellent displays ranging from a reproduction World War II canteen to a
room devoted to Wallace & Ladmo, a popular Phoenix children’s show. Admission: $5
adults, $4 seniors 60 and up and ages 12 to 18, free for children under 12; free for all
first Sat of the month. Tuesday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., Sunday noon to 
4 p.m. See map p. 132. 
The smaller Tempe Historical Museum, 809 E. Southern Ave., at Rural Road, Tempe
(% 480-350-5100; www.tempe.gov/museum), has hands-on activities that include
diverting the Salt River into canals and fields. Admission: Free. Monday through
Thursday and Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sun 1 to 5 p.m.; closed Friday and major hol-
idays. See map p. 132.
Stop in at the 1910 schoolhouse that houses the Scottsdale Historical Museum, 7333
E. Scottsdale Mall, Scottsdale (% 480-945-4499; www.scottsdalemuseum.com),
to view the town B.C.C. (Before Conspicuous Consumption) and to pick up a map for
a self-guided walking tour highlighting 13 historic locations of the 1894 town site now
called Old Town Scottsdale. Admission: Free. October through May Wednesday
through Sat 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., Sunday noon to 4 p.m.; June and September Wednesday
through Saturday 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., closed July to August. See map p. 132.
The Williamsburg-gone-West Pioneer Arizona Living History Museum, 3901 W.
Pioneer Rd., 30 minutes north of downtown Phoenix, just off Exit 225 of I-17 (% 623-
465-1052; www.pioneer-arizona.com), has 28 original and reconstructed build-
ings — everything from a sheriff’s office to a Victorian mansion. The costumed staff
demonstrates frontier activities, such as blacksmithing, while highlights include staged
shoot-’em-ups and a petting zoo. Admission: $7 adults, $6 seniors, $5 ages 6 to 18, free
ages 5 and under. October through May Wednesday to Sunday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; June
to September Wednesday through Sunday 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. See map p. 132.

outdoor shop; a good one in Scottsdale is REI, 12634 N. Paradise Village
Pkwy. W. (% 602-996-5400; www.rei.com). Beginners often dust their
wheels on the trail starting at Dynamite Road and Pima, 8 miles north of
Bell Road in Scottsdale; the desert blooms are gorgeous here in spring.
South Mountain Park, 10919 S. Central Ave. (% 602-495-0222; http://
phoenix.gov/PARKS/hikesoth.html), and Papago Park, 625 N. Galvin
Pkwy. (% 602-256-3220; http://phoenix.gov/PARKS/hikepapa.html),
in south and east Phoenix, respectively, have plenty of trails to keep all
levels happily shifting gears.
Boating
Spend a sunny afternoon on the Tempe Town Lake by renting a kayak
(one-person kayak $10 per hour, two-person $16 per hour) or pedal boat
($12 per hour), or four- to six-person electric boat ($40–$65 per hour)
from the RioLago Cruise kiosk near the Mill Avenue bridge at Tempe
Beach Park, 55 W. Rio Salado Pkwy. (% 480-517-4050; www.riolago
cruise.com); be prepared to leave a driver’s license and credit card as 
a deposit.
Golfing
No doubt about it: In the Valley, golf rules. With more than 200 courses,
Greater Phoenix consistently ranks among the world’s top-five golf desti-
nations. You’re never much more than a putt away from some major
greens action. You can pick up the free Phoenix Golf Guide at most
local hotels, resorts, and golf courses, as well as at the Valley visitor
bureaus (see the “Finding Information after You Arrive” section earlier in
this chapter); or order it in advance by logging on to www.azgolfguides.
com/pubs.html. See Chapter 5 to find out about golf schools and golf-
vacation packages.
Want to try some different courses but don’t feel like juggling tee times?
Stand-by Golf (% 480-874-3133) is a good, well, standby for last-minute
reservations. Call between 6 and 9 p.m. the night before you want to hit
the links to see what’s available.
Unless I say otherwise, greens fees for the following recommended
courses — arranged roughly in ascending budget-destroying order —
include a cart. You find the best deals on weekday summer afternoons,
usually the timeframe represented by the lowest prices in the following
info.
Municipal courses
You can pay through the nose to play the Valley in high season — which is
why people actually camp out for tee times at Papago Golf Course, 5595
E. Moreland St., south of McDowell and 52nd Street, Phoenix (% 602-275-
8428; http://phoenix.gov/SPORTS/papago.html), surrounded by
stunning red rock buttes and costing just $18 to $38 (plus $11 for a cart).
The scenery isn’t as dramatic but, then, the wait isn’t nearly as long at
Chapter 11: Phoenix, Scottsdale, and the Valley of the Sun 143

Encanto Park, 2745 N. 15th Ave., 2 blocks south of Thomas, Phoenix 
(% 602-253-3963; http://phoenix.gov/PARKS/park25.html)
($18–$38, plus $11 for a cart). See also the listing for the Tournament
Players Club in the “Resort courses” section, for details on a municipal
course there.
Public courses
Arizona State alum Phil Mickelson studied his swing at the challenging
Pete Dye–designed ASU-Karsten Golf Course, 1125 E. Rio Salado Pkwy., at
Rural Road, Tempe (% 480-921-8070; www.asukarsten.com) ($26–$89).
Tom Fazio’s Raptor course at Grayhawk Golf Club, 8620 E. Thompson
Peak Pkwy, 3 miles north of Frank Lloyd Wright Boulevard, Scottsdale 
(% 480-502-1800; www.grayhawk.com), is one of the toughest — and
most gorgeous — in the Valley, with thick desert, deep fairway bunkers,
and a 2° slope that can make your ball do funny things ($75–$210). Raven
Golf Club at South Mountain, 3636 E. Baseline Rd., Phoenix (% 602-243-
3636; www.ravenatsouthmountain.com), features lush, green fairways
bordered by more than 7,000 pine trees, so you never have to hit into dirt
($50–$129). Dramatic elevation changes and deep sand bunkers challenge

Careful of those cacti: 
Tips for desert golfers
If you’re used to teeing off onto wide, rolling greens, desert golf — also known as
target golf — can be an entirely new ball game. To master these prickly courses:
 Concentrate on aim rather than distance. Fairways are narrow and frequently
broken up by desert, so you have to hit the ball straight off the tee to get to the
greens, even if that means not using a driver right away. (Get it? That’s why they
call it “target” golf.)
 Bring lots of balls. On desert courses, the rough is really rough — as in prickly and
spiny. You’re not going to want to go poking around in that stuff.
 If you do go searching for a ball, take a club with you so you can clobber the rat-
tlesnakes (just kidding about the clobbering — slow but steady retreat is a much
better strategy — but not kidding about snakes. Use the club to make sure any
underbrush where your ball is hiding out is critter-clear).
 Bring lots of water and keep drinking it, even if you don’t think you’re thirsty. You
don’t always realize when you’re getting dehydrated.
 Don’t forget sunscreen and a hat.
 If you see wildlife about to carry your ball off the fairway, yell loudly — or take
a mulligan.

players at the Superstition Springs Golf Course, 6542 E. Baseline Rd., at
Power Road, Mesa (% 480-985-5555; www.superstitionspringsgc.
com), used in the past as a PGA Qualifying Site ($39–$105). The Scottish-
style links laid out by Ben Crenshaw and Bill Coore at the Talking Stick
Golf Club, 9998 E. Indian Bend Rd., 1 mile east of Loop 101, Scottsdale
(% 480-860-2221; www.talkingstickgolfclub.com), are some of the
best bunkered in Arizona ($85–$170). We-ko-pa Golf Club, 18200 E. Toh
Vee Circle, 11⁄2 miles north of the intersection of Beeline Highway and
Shea Boulevard, Fountain Hills (% 480-836-9000; www.wekopa.com), on
the Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation reservation, affords spectacular views
of the Four Peaks mountain range and the surrounding desert — no resi-
dential development is allowed on the reservation ($45–$195).
Resort courses
The perks of staying at a resort include discounted greens fees and first
dibs on tee times at their golf courses, which consistently rank among
the Valley’s best — the better to lure guests. The rates listed here assume
you won’t have these resorts’ room keys among your possessions. All the
resort courses have different reservation policies for nonguests, so ask
how far in advance you need to reserve (requirements range from 1–30
days).
Jay Moorish incorporated the astonishing scenery at The Boulders,
34831 N. Tom Darlington Dr., Carefree (% 480-488-7349; www.the
bouldersclub.com) into the two courses he designed, with eye-popping
effect. If you have to choose one, go South ($75–$250). The 27 beautifully
landscaped holes at The Phoenician, 6000 E. Camelback Rd. at 64th
Street, Scottsdale (% 480-423-2449; www.thephoenician.com), mix tra-
ditional and target styles. Camelback Mountain serves as a major distrac-
tion ($40–$185). If you’ve watched the FBR Open, formerly the Phoenix
Open, you’ve already eyeballed the Tournament Players Club (TPC) of
Scottsdale, 17020 N. Hayden Rd., at Bell Road, Scottsdale (% 480-585-
3939; www.tpc.com/daily/scottsdale), the Scottsdale Fairmont’s 
fairways. The TPC’s Stadium course is longer ($89–$238), but the 
tighter, shorter Desert is a bargain municipal course ($45–$60). The 
Jay Moorish–designed Monument course at Troon North Golf Club,
Chapter 11: Phoenix, Scottsdale, and the Valley of the Sun 145
Mercury up, golf prices down
Golf courses practically give away golf in the Valley in summer. If you’re willing to hit
the links in the hot months — and especially during the week after 2 p.m. — you can
get great deals on some of the Valley’s most exclusive courses. And while they don’t
have scantily clad maidens and lads with fans following you around, some resorts,
like The Boulders and Westin Kierland, do the next best thing. They give you golf carts
with built-in cooling systems.

10320 E. Dynamite Blvd., North Scottsdale (% 480-585-5300; www.troon-
golf.com) — the new Four Seasons’ green stomping grounds — is peerless
for desert beauty and, according to many, difficulty. Some veteran golfers
prefer the sister Pinnacle course, which Tom Weiskopf had a hand in; it’s no
slouch in either category ($75–$295). Always in impeccable condition,
Marriott’s Wildfire Golf Club, 5350 E. Marriott Dr., at Tatum Road, Phoenix
(% 480-473-0205; www.wildfiregolf.com), is desert style but user
friendly, with wide fairways and big, multilevel greens ($50–$205). Of the 54
holes of championship golf at the luxurious Wigwam Resort, 300 Wigwam
Blvd., Litchfield Park (% 800-909-4224 or 623-935-9414; www.wigwamre-
sort.com), the award-winning Gold course, designed by Robert Trent
Jones, Sr., in 1961, welcomes duffers with its mature pines and palms and
well-bunkered greens ($35–$152).
Hiking
The Valley has numerous places to hike, and some of the best trails 
and views are just minutes from the asphalt. Get the big picture from Day
Hikes and Trail Rides in and around Phoenix, by Roger and Ethel Freeman,
available in most Valley sporting goods stores and online at
www.amazon.com ($14.95).
Straddling the border between Phoenix and Scottsdale, Camelback
Mountain (http://phoenix.gov/PARKS/hikecmlb.html) has two 2- to
2.5-mile round-trip trails guaranteed to work your legs and your heart.
They’re nearly all uphill and pretty rocky in places — you see lots of rock
climbers hanging out (and off) — but the payoff is amazing views from the
top. The north side trail begins at the Echo Canyon parking lot east of
McDonald Drive and Tatum. You can find the east side trail by hiking west on
Cholla Lane off Invergordon Drive (you can park only on Invergordon,
though, so be prepared to hike another half mile to the trailhead). Both trails
are busiest in the morning and early evening — for a good reason: Don’t
even think about trying these hikes in the midday heat.
Also challenging and popular because it leads to one of the best panoramas
of the city is the 1.2-mile Piestewa Peak Summit Trail in the Phoenix
Mountains Preserve (% 602-262-7901; http://phoenix.gov/PARKS/
hikesqua.html); be prepared for lots of switchbacks toward the top. Take
Lincoln Drive between 22nd and 23rd streets to Piestewa Peak Drive.

Can I buy you a bottled water, baby?
The latest Lycra hiking fashions are on display on Camelback Mountain, a hot (some-
times literally) meeting spot for local singles. If you’re seeking an athletic mate, hiking
here might be a peak experience — and, at the least, you’ll have gotten some exercise.

The largest municipal park in the country, South Mountain Park, South
Phoenix (% 602-495-0222; http://phoenix.gov/PARKS/hikesoth.
html), is honeycombed with dramatic desert-and-mountain trails. To get
there, take Central Avenue south until you can’t go any farther (about 
2 miles past Baseline). Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
you can pick up a trail map at the visitor center, or on the weekend, from
the ranger station at the park’s entrance. National Trail, a 14-mile work-
out (for the very fit only, please), takes you past Indian petroglyphs as
well as amazing scenery; follow the signs to the end of San Juan Road
inside the park.
Want to know precisely what prickly plants you’re coming up against — I
hope not literally — on the trail? See the “Ecotours” section later in this
chapter for naturalist-led hikes.
Horseback riding
Saddle up in South Mountain Park with Ponderosa Stables, 10215 S.
Central Ave., south of Baseline (% 602-268-1261). Prices start at $25 an
hour for scenic trail rides; an early morning breakfast trot sets you back
$32. D-Spur Ranch, Peralta Road, Gold Canyon (% 602-810-7029), about
20 minutes southeast of Phoenix via Highway 60, offers one-hour ($26),
two-hour ($50), four-hour ($90), and full-day ($150) rides into the
Superstition Mountains. You don’t have to be a guest at the Sheraton
Wild Horse Pass (see the “Staying in Style” section earlier in this chap-
ter), to book a ride at their Koli Equestrian Center with Chuck’s Trail
Riding (% 602-796-3495 or 602-361-6102; www.chuckstrailriding.
com). The cost is $65 for 90 minutes (slightly less in summer).
River rafting and tubing
River rafting is as reliable as the rainfall in Arizona — that is, not very —
but in a good year, the section of the Salt River that runs northeast of
Phoenix can get pretty wet ’n’ wild. If the nearby White Mountains have
enough snowmelt, you can ride class III and IV rapids through starkly dra-
matic, ancient granite gorges from late February to late May. Outfitters
running Salt River raft trips include Wilderness Aware Rafting (% 800-
231-7238; www.inaraft.com), with prices ranging from $99 per person

Horsing around
Come out West to see a horse, of course? The 400-acre WestWorld of Scottsdale,
16601 N. Pima Rd., Scottsdale (% 480-312-6802; www.ci.scottsdale.az.us/
westworld), hosts a variety of equine-related events — everything from rodeos and
polo matches to Arabian horse shows. Call to hear a recorded schedule of events and
directions to the center.

(including permit) for a five-hour trip to $775 for a five-day adventure;
and Mild to Wild Rafting (% 800-567-6745; www.mild2wildrafting.
com), where you pay $99 for a full day on the river ($105 on weekends),
$285 for a two-day/one-night trip.
Tennis
Most all the big resorts offer top-notch tennis facilities, but few are open
to outsiders. If you’re not staying at a resort, you still have a few good
options to court. It costs just $2 per person for a 90-minute session
($3.50 for night-lit courts) at the excellent city-run Phoenix Tennis
Center, 6330 N. 21st Ave. (% 602-249-3712), and only $1.50 to $2.20 at
Mountain View Tennis Center, 1104 E. Grovers St. (% 602-534-2500), in
North Phoenix. Alternatively, contact the Phoenix Parks and Recreation
Department (% 602-262-6862; phoenix.gov/SPORTS/tennis.html)
Monday through Friday to find a city park with tennis courts near where
you’re staying; most facilities are free and readily available during the
week, especially during business hours.
Rooting for the Home Team: Spectator Sports
When the Arizona Diamondbacks slithered onto the sports scene in 1998,
Phoenix became one of the few U.S. cities to have professional baseball,
basketball, hockey, and football teams. And the high-quality action at
Chase Field, built for the D-backs (initially, as Bank One Ballpark), and at
the America West Arena, where the Phoenix Suns go up and down the

It’s a new (spa) age
The desert has long been considered a healing — as well as skin-drying — place, 
so don’t be surprised to find Phoenix and Scottsdale at the forefront of the latest 
spiritual-sybarite trends. Forget Swedish massage. These days, Far Eastern rituals are
meeting Native American remedies in aromatherapy-scented rooms presided over by
body workers who can unblock your chakras faster than you can say Deepak Chopra.
At the Valley’s poshest spas, expect everything from rubdowns with heated stones
that have been “recharged” in the moonlight to treatments that involve oils being
dripped onto your back — or your third eye.
The resorts generally have the best-equipped pleasure centers. The spas at The
Boulders, The Phoenician, Arizona Biltmore, Hyatt Regency Scottsdale, Fairmont
Scottsdale Princess, and Marriott’s Camelback Inn, all detailed in the “Staying in Style”
section earlier in this chapter, happily accept day guests. Prices start from around
$125 for a 50-minute treatment and go up to about $500 for a full day of indulgence,
including the use of the resort’s fitness facilities and, often, lunch. Sure the spas are
pricey, but, hey, where else can you find bliss in a dimly lit room with a stranger —
guilt free?

court, have breathed life back into downtown Phoenix. Sports bars and
restaurants are always packed on game days, and the streets buzz with
excitement.
Game nights create gridlock on downtown streets, so build in plenty of
sitting-motionless-in-car and/or finding-parking-and-making-your-way-to-
your-seat time before any sports event you attend. Most of the garages,
which charge between $7 and $10 an evening, are within an 8- to ten-
minute walk of the ballparks.
You can buy tickets directly from the sports venues or team; they’re also
available through Ticketmaster (% 480-784-4444; www.ticketmaster.
com).
Baseball
The Arizona Diamondbacks may be the main event, but you can watch
America’s favorite pastime being played at arenas Valleywide.
The Arizona Diamondbacks go to bat at Chase Field, 401. E. Jefferson
St., at 7th Street (% 602-514-8400; www.azdiamondbacks.com for online
tickets), an attraction in itself (see the “Stadium Mania” sidebar later in
this chapter). Tickets, which range from $8 to $95, aren’t always easy to
score; buy them as soon as you know your schedule. If you don’t mind
cheering from the second or third levels (all the arena’s sightlines are
excellent), your chances are better than if you have your heart set on
seeing your favorite player up close. You may also score top seats —
usually for top prices — if you log on to www.stubhub.com, where
season ticket holders sell tickets to games that they can’t attend.
Many out-of-towners who visit the Valley from late February to early
April can still root, root, root for the home team at one of Arizona’s
Cactus League spring-training games. Tickets cost from $5 to $25 and 
are available through www.tickets.com or % 800-905-3315. The Mesa
Convention and Visitors Bureau (% 480-827-4700; www.mesacvb.com),
is the best source for game-time information in the Phoenix area. (At this
writing, the official Cactus League site, www.cactusleague.com, isn’t as
comprehensive as Mesa’s site.)
You can also contact your favorite team individually:
 Anaheim Angels: Tempe Diablo Stadium, 2200 W. Alameda Drive, 
3 blocks south of Broadway Road and east of 48th Street, Tempe 
(% 480-858-7585 or 480-350-5205; www.tempe.gov/diablostadium).
 Chicago Cubs: HoHoKam Park Stadium, 1235 N. Center St., at Brown
Street, Mesa (% 480-964-4467).
 Kansas City Royals and Texas Rangers (they share): Surprise

Basketball
Downtown’s streets are a sea of purple and orange on nights when the
NBA’s Phoenix Suns (% 602-379-7867; www.suns.com) hold court at the
US Airways Center, 201 E. Jefferson St., between 1st and 3rd streets; good
seats go fast, so plan ahead. Prices range from $12 to $165. The Women’s
National Basketball Association’s Phoenix Mercury (% 602-252-9622;
www.wnba.com/mercury), which takes over the arena between June and
August, also have die-hard devotees. Mercury team members meet and
greet their fans whenever possible, and the club has one of the WNBA’s
highest attendance rates. Tickets cost between $9 and $140.
Football
Catch the Arizona Cardinals’ (% 800-999-1402 or 623-266-5000; www.

Aug 2006) in Glendale, between Loop 101 and 91st Avenue., Maryland
Avenue and Bethany Home Road; tickets run $10 to $325. The ASU Sun
Devils (% 480-965-2381; www.thesundevils.com) continue to play in
the Cardinals’ old stomping (and tackling) grounds, Sun Devils Stadium,
5th Street at Stadium Drive, in Tempe.

Ouch — that ticket price hurts!
If you can’t score any seats through the usual means, you have another option:
Phoenix is one of the few cities where scalping is legal. Just be sure to check your
tickets carefully before handing over the cash and make your deal off the venue’s
grounds, where scalping is illegal — although just a few yards away is okay.

Hockey
Hockey is showing up in the strangest places these days (the Tampa Bay
Lightning won the 2004 Stanley Cup), and Phoenix is no exception. The
Arizona Coyotes (% 480-473-5600; www.phoenixcoyotes.com) are
now ensconced in the brand-new Glendale Arena, at the intersection of
the Loop 101 freeway and Glendale Avenue, in Glendale (30 minutes from
downtown Phoenix). Hockey great Wayne Gretzky is a managing partner
and head coach. Single-game tickets are available at the Coyotes’ Web
site and cost $15 to $100.
Seeing the Valley by Guided Tour
In addition to the tours listing in this section, see the “Biking” and “River-
rafting and tubing” sections of the “Staying Active” section earlier in this
chapter.
General bus tours
Gray Line Tours of Phoenix (% 800-732-0327 or 602-495-9100; www.
graylinearizona.com) traces the city’s history from its Hohokam
Indian past during a four-hour tour ($49 adults, $25 children under 11).
Stops include the state capitol, Heritage Square, Old Town Scottsdale,
celebrity homes in Paradise Valley, and the Arizona State University
campus in Tempe. The more intimate Vaughan’s Southwest Custom
Tours, Inc. (% 800-513-1381 or 602-971-1381; www.southwesttours.
com) are a bit longer and have smaller groups (12 people maximum),
which cost $50 per adult (children 12 and under are half price) and
cover a variety of downtown sites and the Pueblo Grande Museum. 
Both companies provide hotel pickups in Phoenix and Scottsdale.
Ecotours
The earth-friendly excursions offered by Windwalker Expeditions
(% 888-785-3382 or 480-585-3382; www.windwalkerexpeditions.com)
include a three- to four-hour Botanical Jeep Tour ($100 per person, based
on a group of five), which explores geological rock formations and slot
canyons in the Bradshaw Mountains, and an all-day Archaeology Ecotour
($165, including lunch), which adds an exploration of the area’s ruins to
the Botanical Jeep Tour’s hiking/four-wheeling agenda.
Four-wheel adventure tours
Climb aboard the most powerful 4x4 for a fun four-hour excursion
through the Four Peaks wilderness with Desert Storm Hummer Tours,
15525 N. 83rd Way, Suite 8, Scottsdale (% 866-374-8637 or 480-922-0020;
www.dshummer.com). Both daytime ($100 adults, $75 ages 6–16) and
nighttime ($125/$100) tours afford up-close looks at denizens of the
desert; after dark, peering through night-vision goggles at glowing scor-
pions and jumping cacti adds to the adventure.

Stadium tour
Its name no longer sounds as friendly as when it was called BOB (for
Bank One Ballpark), but Chase Field, 401 E. Jefferson St., at 7th Street
(% 602-462-6799; www.diamondbacks.com), is still a great place to get
up-close and personal with when there’s no Diamondback action to dis-
tract you. Terrific 75-minute behind-the-scenes tours take you to see
everything from the private pool area near third base to the National
Baseball Hall of Fame memorabilia. (Sorry, they won’t retract the famous
ceiling for you.) Outside of baseball season, tours depart Monday
through Saturday at 9:30 a.m., 11 a.m., 12:30 p.m., and 3 p.m. In season —
but only when the D-backs play at night — tours are offered Friday and
Saturday at 3:30 p.m. The stadium doesn’t offer tours on day games or
during holidays and special events. Tickets, sold at the Tour Window at
the main box office, cost $6 for adults, $4 for ages 7 to 12 and seniors
over 60, $2 for ages 4 to 6, and free for ages 3 and under.
Following an Itinerary
I have plenty of ideas about the best ways for you to arrange your days
(and, unlike my family and friends, you may even pay attention to them),
but the Valley is very spread out. If you’re sequestered away in a North
Scottsdale resort, you drive a lot more on these itineraries than if you’re
holed up in central Phoenix. Similarly, many of the best activities are
outdoors. Most people visit in winter, when the weather is great. The
heat can get unbearable between May and October (and especially in
June, July, and August), especially midday. (For details on the attrac-
tions, restaurants, and activities mentioned in these itineraries, see the
corresponding sections earlier in this chapter.)
One-day itinerary
If you have only one day in the Valley, concentrate your time in down-
town and central Phoenix, where you can get in a good dose of nature
and Native American culture — as well as a little retailing. Start out at
the Pueblo Grand Museum and Cultural Center, easy to reach by free-
way from pretty much anywhere, and then head over to the Desert
Botanical Garden; both are in the Papago Salado part of town. Lunch 
is easy: You can dine at either the Arcadia Café at the gardens or at the
clone of this restaurant at your next stop, the Heard Museum. Spend 
the afternoon perusing the exhibits and great gift shop, and then head a
short way north to the beautiful Art Deco Arizona Biltmore resort, and
kick back with a cocktail on the terrace. If you haven’t satisfied your
acquisitive urges at the Heard, you’re right near Biltmore Fashion Park,
where you can drop some more dollars and then dine at one of the
upscale chain restaurants there (Sam’s Cafe is the best of the bunch).
Alternately, just a few blocks away, Delux has great burgers. Not com-
pletely done in? Boogie over to Old Town Scottsdale. You should plan to
dress the part (drop-dead dramatic) if you want to check out the Valley’s
see-and-be-seen clubs; if you prefer not to get all gussied up, simply
Part III: Exploring the Big Cities 
152

duck in to one of the more casual watering holes, such as the Rusty Spur
Saloon. (Note: If you think this itinerary will send you into overdrive, cut
out the Pueblo Grand Museum; the Heard Museum covers some of the
same cultural territory.)
Two-day itinerary
If you have two days, you can take a more leisurely approach to the
sights covered on the one-day itinerary and add a few more. Have a
quick swim at your hotel, and then spend the morning at the Heard
Museum. In the afternoon, head over to downtown Scottsdale. If you
didn’t already have lunch at the Heard, chow down at Cowboy Ciao
before browsing the Fifth Avenue shops and Main Street galleries. The
nearby Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art and the boutiques and
galleries of Old Scottsdale should keep you happy the rest of the after-
noon. If you want to stick around for the nightlife, you can eat at Los
Olivos (or save Cowboy Ciao for dinner).
On day two, visit the Pueblo Grand Museum and Cultural Park and the
Desert Botanical Garden in the morning. In the afternoon, head to north-
ern Scottsdale to tour Taliesin West and visit Cosanti. If you didn’t eat at
the Desert Botanical Garden, have lunch at Lon’s at the Hermosa Inn,
close to Cosanti. Still have plastic burning a hole in your pocket? Make a
beeline for Kierland Commons mall, where you can follow up more shop-
ping with dinner at Zinc Bistro, Deseo, The Greene House, or North
(make reservations for whichever one you choose).
If you’re traveling with kids (or want to get in touch with your inner
child), skip Taliesin West and Cosanti, and instead add the Arizona
Science Center and either the Phoenix Museum of History and the
Arizona Doll & Toy Museum or a tour of Chase Field, all close to the
science center. You can also substitute the Phoenix Zoo for the Pueblo
Grande Museum and Cultural Park.
Three-day itinerary
Follow the two-day itinerary until the afternoon of the second day, and
then head over from the Papago Salado area (locations of the Pueblo
Grand Museum and the Desert Botanical Garden) to nearby Tempe.
Spend the afternoon kayaking, lake touring, strolling along Mill Avenue,
checking out the sights on the Arizona State University campus, or any
combination thereof; Four Peaks Brewing Co. is a good place to refuel.
On day three, head up to Cosanti so you can watch the bronze bells
being cast, and then go over to Taliesin West. The drive north along
Scottsdale Road to the towns of Carefree and Cave Creek isn’t long.
Check out the new, all-organic cuisine at one of The Boulders Resort’s
dining venues, then browse the ritzy boutiques and the Heard Museum’s
northern branch at El Pedregal; or go the wilder west route with chili
beer at Crazy Ed’s Satisfied Frog (see “Living It Up after Dark,” later in
this chapter) and the more down-home shops of Cave Creek.
Chapter 11: Phoenix, Scottsdale, and the Valley of the Sun 153

Shopping the Local Stores
Shopping in the Valley tends to be an all-mall affair — with several
notable exceptions, detailed in the “What to look for and where to find
it” section later in this chapter. Don’t judge Valley shops by their loca-
tions: You sometimes find highly original, individual stores in faceless
retail strips.
Best shopping areas
You can drop your dough at plenty of places throughout the Valley, but
downtown Scottsdale has the most concentrated doses of retail activity
per square block. The main indulgence districts here include, from north
to south: 5th Avenue, angling diagonally between Indian School and
Scottsdale roads, where Native American arts and jewelry shops and
Western galleries number among the one-of-a-kind boutiques; the inter-
secting Marshall Way Arts District, roughly between Indian School Road
and 3rd Avenue, lined with (mostly) contemporary art galleries; Old
Town Scottsdale (see the “More cool things to see and do” section ear-
lier in this chapter), featuring several Old West curio shops; and the
adjacent Main Street Arts & Antiques district, Main Street and 1st
Avenue between Scottsdale Road and Goldwater Boulevard, where the
galleries tend toward the traditional and the Western, and boutiques sell
a wide range of stuff that’s been around long enough to get expensive.
Park your car in the free lot on the corner of 2nd Street and Wells Fargo
Avenue near Old Scottsdale and explore the shopping areas by foot or
trolley (see the “Free-for-all” sidebar near the beginning of this chapter).
Some spaces in the lot have a three-hour limit (and those are marked),
but the rest are completely off the meter.
In Tempe, Mill Avenue, from University Drive near the Arizona State
University campus to Rio Salado Parkway, is less granola-y than it used
to be — chains like Abercrombie & Fitch have largely replaced the inde-
pendents — but the retail scene is still young, hip, and strollable.
Part III: Exploring the Big Cities 
154
Antiques alert
If you have a fondness for things past or for country cute tchotchkes, check out the
Midwest-meets-the-desert town of Glendale, about 20 minutes west of Sky Harbor
Airport, where more than 90 stores stock antiques and stuff with patches and frills.
The best pickings are in Old Towne Glendale, on Glendale Avenue between 57th
Avenue and 58th Drive, but be sure to meander a few blocks to the north to the con-
verted bungalows in the historic Catlin Court district. The Glendale Office of Tourism
and Visitor Center, 5800 W. Glenn Dr., near 58th and Glendale avenues (% 877-800-
2601 or 623-930-4500; www.visitglendale.com), open Monday through Saturday
from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., has maps of both areas.

Getting mall’d
Sometimes I feel like a new mall opens in the Valley every month (five
more are slated to break ground by 2008). The more recent major arrivals
are far-flung: Kierland Commons, at Scottsdale Road and Greenway
Parkway in North Phoenix (but bordering on Scottsdale) (% 480-348-
1577; www.kierlandcommons.com), appeals to the usual upscale sus-
pects with its array of boutiques; Desert Ridge Market Place, Tatum
Boulevard and Loop 101, north Phoenix (% 480-513-7586; www.shop
desertridge.com), features separate “districts” catering to the young
and (retail) restless; while Chandler Fashion Center, Chandler Boulevard
and Loop 101 (% 480-812-8488; www.westcor.com) in Chandler, south-
east of Phoenix, almost as large as Scottsdale Fashion Square (discussed
in this section), has anchor stores such as Nordstrom and Sears.
A few central standbys are good options, too. The Arizona Center, Van
Buren between 3rd and 5th streets, downtown Phoenix (% 602-271-4000;
www.arizonacenter.com), is more outdoor entertainment complex than
mall, with lushly landscaped courtyards, restaurants and bars, a 24-screen
movie theater, and some 30 small shops and retail carts. Come here to
pick up Southwestern-themed gifts or anything you can think of that bears
a Phoenix sports team logo. In nice weather, Native American musicians
often play in the center courtyard at lunchtime.
Arizona Mills, 5000 Arizona Mills Circle, Tempe (southeast quadrant of I-
10 and U.S. Highway 60) (% 480-491-9700; www.arizonamills.com), is
bargain and big-store central, featuring leading discount outlets such as
Last Call Neiman Marcus, Marshall’s, and Burlington Coat Factory, and
oversize retailers such as Virgin Megastore and Linens-n-Things; the
smaller stores tend toward the lower end of the retail spectrum. An
IMAX theater, a 24-plex cinema, a branch of Steven Spielberg’s super
high-tech GameWorks play center (% 480-839-4263; www.gameworks.
com); and theme eateries, such as the Rainforest Café, mean you won’t
have any problem dragging the kids along (although getting them out
may be difficult).
Biltmore Fashion Park, Camelback and 24th Street, Phoenix (% 602-
955-8400; www.westcor.com), is the Camelback Corridor’s retail and
restaurant hub, where seriously upscale shops — we’re talking Saks,
Williams Sonoma, Gucci — mingle among bricked paths and lush green-
ery with middle-of-the-roaders such as Macy’s and Pottery Barn. Suffering
from shopper’s fatigue? Stop in at Elizabeth Arden’s Red Door Salon for a
pedicure.
If you’re in town on any Friday between October and early May, don’t miss
the farmers’ market held here from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., with everything
from gorgeous produce, baked goods, and exotic Southwest products
(prickly-pear jam anyone?) to locally produced jewelry and imported
Italian-leather briefcases.
Chapter 11: Phoenix, Scottsdale, and the Valley of the Sun 155

Scottsdale Fashion Square, Camelback and Scottsdale roads (% 480-
990-7800; www.westcor.com), is the undisputed queen of upscale Arizona
malls, with 1.8-million square feet of retail space, retractable skylights, and
the likes of Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, Dana Buchman, and Tiffany & Co.
singing siren songs to your credit cards. When you’re ready to give the
plastic a break — or at least a change of pace — a movie theater and
panoply of restaurants await.
In Chapter 14, see Day-Trip #2 for the Outlets at Casa Grande.
Getting (boutique) mall’d
The Borgata of Scottsdale, 6166 N. Scottsdale Rd. between Lincoln and
McDonald drives (% 602-953-6311; www.borgata.com), looks like a
Tuscan village, replete with courtyards, fountains, and (maybe not so
Tuscan) upscale specialty shops, selling everything from Southwest art
to silver jewelry and resort apparel. Be sure to fill up on Southwestern
kitchen accessories at the wonderful and whimsical Two Plates Full.
El Pedregal Festival Marketplace at The Boulders, 34505 N. Scottsdale
Rd., just north of Carefree Highway (% 480-488-1072; www.elpedregal.
com), may just be Arizona’s most scenic place to shop, its low-slung
Pueblo architecture blending (almost) organically with the surrounding
desert and rocks. Speaking of organic, in 2006, El Pedregal debuted a
Friday-evening (4–7pm) market featuring fresh eco- and health-friendly
local produce.
Although not as quaint as the other two, Shops at Gainey Village,
Scottsdale Road and Doubletree Ranch Road, Scottsdale (% 858-622-
0858), pays homage to its site on a former horse farm with adjoining
faux-rustic plazas outside. Women’s apparel, including a boutique that
features Judy Arizona’s designer duds, dominates here, but upscale
home furnishings are on offer as well.

At the (art) hop
On Thursday nights from 7 to 9 p.m. year-round (except Thanksgiving), take part in the
Scottsdale Gallery Association’s self-guided ArtWalks (% 480-990-3939; www.
scottsdalegalleries.com), with cocktail receptions, live entertainment, and
artist appearances designed to put you in an art-buying mood. Phoenix gets into the
art action each month with First Fridays (% 602-256-7539; www.artlinkphoenix.
com). (I don’t have to tell you which day of the week and which part of the month they
take place, do I?) Park downtown in the lot of the Burton Barr Central Library, 1221 N.
Central Ave., south of Culver Street, and from 6 to 11 p.m., hop an ArtLink shuttle that
loops around the 60-odd participating galleries, studios, and businesses (check the
art listings in the local papers).

What to look for and where to find it
Whether your tastes run to golf gear or high art, you can find something
to satisfy them in the Valley.
Art
True, the Valley may have one of the highest rates per capita of can-
vasses filled with lonesome cowboys, but you find a whole lot more in
town than Western art. In fact, Scottsdale is second only to Santa Fe as
an arts destination in the Southwest. With more than 125 galleries and
studios from which to choose, you can see everything from hand-blown
glass and Native American abstracts to contemporary mixed-media
pieces — and even plenty of non-cliché Western art:
 Eclectic: Art One, 4120 N. Marshall Way, Scottsdale (% 480-946-
5076), is the place to see the up-and-comers and maybe get some
art bargains. Most of the work by the young art students (the major-
ity from Arizona) represented doesn’t run higher than $1,000. One 
of the most dynamic galleries in the Valley, the 5,000-square-foot
Cervini Haas/Gallery Materia, 4222 N. Marshall Way, Scottsdale
(% 480-949-1262), showcases the contemporary paintings and
high-end crafts of some 100 artists from the Americas, Asias, and
Europe. At the Work of Artists Gallery, 10835 N. Tatum Blvd., Suite
101, Phoenix (% 480-596-0304), you find wood carvings, paintings,
pottery, furniture, and Native American crafts by more than 200
artists, costing anywhere from $1 to $5,000.
 Contemporary: Chiaroscuro, 7160 Main St., Scottsdale (% 480-
429-0711), a clone from Sante Fe, puts on shows by major contem-
porary artists like Ricardo Mazal and Howard Ben Tre. Another
New Mexico import, Riva Yares, 3625 N. Bishop Lane, Scottsdale
(% 480-947-3251), is renowned for its contemporary and modern
sculpture and painting. The work tends to be exciting but not inac-
cessible (except maybe in price). The talent represented by Lisa
Sette Gallery, 4142 N. Marshall Way, Scottsdale (% 480-990-7342),
is a little less established but well-known enough to command high
prices for works of photography, sculpture, and painting.
 Regional/Western: Faust Gallery, 7103 E. Main St., Scottsdale 
(% 480-946-6345) carries Native American work in a variety of
genres, from jewelry to contemporary painting, as well as Mata
Ortiz’s pottery. Trailside Galleries, 7330 Scottsdale Mall,
Scottsdale (% 480-945-7751), showcases several members of the
Cowboy Artists of America, including founder Joe Beeler, as well as
other high-end Western painters. Collectors of authentic Native
American artifacts have been coming to Old Territorial, 7077 E.
Main St. Suite #7, Scottsdale (% 480-945-5432), since 1969.
Golf supplies
The Valley definitely has the golf goods — everything from antique 
clubs to discounted state-of-the-art carts. You may like the putting green,
Chapter 11: Phoenix, Scottsdale, and the Valley of the Sun 157

personalized service, and Knuckles, the friendly bulldog, at Hornacek’s
House of Golf, 23369 N. Pima Rd., south of Pinnacle Peak Road,
Scottsdale (% 480-502-0555). Hornacek’s other Scottsdale location,
6107 N. Scottsdale Rd., Suite 114 (% 480-948-5011), has everything the
other store has — except Knuckles. A duffer’s fantasy, In Celebration 
of Golf, 7001 N. Scottsdale Rd., at E. Indian Bend Road, Scottsdale 
(% 480-951-4444), is part golf museum, part golf-art gallery (the coun-
try’s largest), and part upscale golf retail store. Play (virtually) 18 holes
at Pebble Beach in a simulation room, browse 800 pairs of shoes, or just
munch free cookies while watching the Golf Channel.
Native American crafts
Street vendors may try to sell you Native American jewelry and other
crafts. Don’t bite; it’s the Arizona version of the Rolex watch scam. 
Only buy from reputable dealers who can guarantee the goods (see
Chapter 19).
For the best one-stop Native American crafts shopping, head straight 
to the gift shop at the Heard Museum (see the “Exploring Phoenix,
Scottsdale, and the Valley of the Sun” section earlier in this chapter).
Here, you can get high-quality weavings, rugs, jewelry, pottery, baskets —
you name it — at fair prices. Better yet, the profits go to the people who
create the crafts rather than to store owners, traders, or other middle
people. The downtown Phoenix store has the best variety, but you also
find a decent selection in the El Pedregal branch in Carefree (see the
“Getting [boutique] mall’d” section earlier in this chapter).
Western wear
Az-Tex Hat Company, 3903 N. Scottsdale Rd., between Main and 1st
streets, Old Town Scottsdale (% 800-972-2116 or 480-481-9900), goes 
to the head of the tailoring class, carefully suiting its headgear to your
cranium. Buy a hatband or get your old Stetson reblocked here. Saba’s
Western Wear, 7254 Main St., at Brown Avenue, Old Town Scottsdale 
Part III: Exploring the Big Cities 
158
The tintinnabulation of the bells, bells, bells
You can tour Cosanti, 6433 E. Doubletree Ranch Rd., at Invergorden, Paradise Valley
(% 800-752-3187 or 480-948-6145; www.cosanti.com), the architectural prototype
for Arcosanti (see Chapter 16) and an Arizona State Historic Site, if you book ahead.
Most people, though, just come for the wonderful ceramic and bronze Soleri wind-
bells (prices start at about $25 and $50, respectively, but can increase to four figures).
Bells are generally cast from 10 a.m. to noon, Monday through Friday; call ahead to
make sure if you want to witness the process. The majority of the proceeds go to the
Arcosanti project, but if you buy a bell from the “Cause” collection, you can contribute
to your favorite participating nonprofit. Open Monday through Saturday 9 a.m. to 
5 p.m., Sunday 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.

(% 480-949-7404), has catered to local cowpokes and cowpoke wannabes
since 1927. Still in the same family, Saba’s expanded to eight stores around
the Valley, including another one in Old Town Scottsdale (3965 N. Brown
Ave., at First Avenue; % 480-947-7664). Another retail pioneer,
Stockman’s Westernwear, 23587 N. Scottsdale Rd. at Pinnacle Peak Rd.,
Scottsdale (% 480-585-6142), has been in business since 1953. If you’re
in North Scottsdale, this is the place to get your dude ranch duds.
Living It Up after Dark
You won’t have a hard time finding something to do in the Valley after
dark. However, unless you stay within walking distance of the areas
where the clubs and concert halls are concentrated, you’ll need wheels
to get wherever you’re going, whether your own car or a taxi.
The best source of listings for clubs and alternative arts events is the free
Phoenix New Times, which comes out on Wednesday. The Rep weekend
entertainment guide, included with the Arizona Republic on Thursday,
but also available for free around town, is good for the more mainstream
arts and nightlife listings. You can also search for Valley events by date,
type, and city on the Republic’s online calendar (www.azcentral.com/
ent/calendar).
Nightlife
Downtown Scottsdale is the prime destination for see-and-be-seen
partiers. Expect to dispense a little cash in this neck of the night owls’
woods — both for covers ($5–$10) and for valet parking (about $5 plus
tip), as regular parking is hard to come by and you can club-hop by foot
(if your heels aren’t too high) around here. Similarly, the clubs and pubs
on Mill Avenue, near Arizona State University in Tempe, are generally
just a sneaker hop away from one another (covers here range from zero
to about $5). Phoenix’s clubs, which tend to be a bit less collegiate than
those in Tempe and less pretentious than those in downtown Scottsdale,
aren’t conveniently clustered. The exception: downtown Phoenix near
Chase Field, where there are several spots to hoist a few post-game cold
ones. Expect cover charges in Phoenix to be between nada and $6 or $7.
Some bars that also serve food open their doors at midday, while most
nightclubs generally don’t open till 8 p.m. In accordance with Arizona
law, closing time is 2:30 a.m., with many places sounding a 2 a.m. last call.
Country and Western
Two-step to live sounds any night of the week at Handlebar-J, 7116 E.
Becker Lane, Scottsdale (% 480-948-0110; www.handlebarj.com), but
come on Wednesday, Thursday, and Sundays if you want to learn how
(for free). Vince Gill and Willie Nelson have dropped in to the Rusty Spur
Saloon, 7245 E. Main St., Old Town Scottsdale (% 480-425-7787; www.
rustyspursaloon.com), where a band gets the crowd boot scootin’
Chapter 11: Phoenix, Scottsdale, and the Valley of the Sun 159

every day and night. The saloon opened its doors in 1922 as Scottsdale’s
first bank; the safe now serves as a walk-in cooler.
Rock and alternative
A former hair salon, the tiny Mason Jar, 2303 E. Indian School Rd.,
Phoenix (% 602-954-0455; www.masonjarlive.com), has hosted top
talent rock for 25 years — from Kid Rock and Megadeth to Stone Temple
Pilots and Jane’s Addiction. Don’t let the name of the Martini Ranch 
& Shaker Room, 7295 E. Stetson Dr. (% 480-970-0500), an Old Town
Scottsdale staple, fool you. The club’s better known for its live rock acts,
DJs, and frat-type crowd than for its martinis. A young crowd squeezes
into a space the size of a living room to see live indy rock at Modified
Arts, 407 E. Roosevelt St., downtown Phoenix (% 602-462-5516), an
alcohol-free venue.
Jazz, blues, and R&B
Char’s Has The Blues, 4631 N. 7th Ave., Phoenix (% 602-230-0205; www.
charshastheblues.com), gets constant nods from the local press as
Arizona’s best blues club. One of the hottest blues, funk, and R&B clubs
to hit town, Sugar Daddy’s, 3102 N. Scottsdale Rd., downtown Scottsdale
(% 480-970-6556; www.sugardaddysaz.com), hosts national acts as
well as local ones, including Arizona blues legend Hans Olsen. At the dis-
tinctively nonglitzy, nonglamorous Rhythm Room, 1019 E Indian School
Rd., Phoenix (% 602-265-4842; www.rhythmroom.com), some of the
country’s best jazz and blues musicians bring it on home. For relaxing
vibes with Old Town Scottsdale ambience, come to J. Chew & Co., 7320
Scottsdale Mall (% 480-946-2733), where smooth jazz, blues, and soul is
played inside or out on the patio.
For a complete listing of blues events, call the Phoenix Blues Society
(% 602-252-0599) or log on to www.phoenixblues.org.
DJ and dance
George Clooney, Rod Stewart, and Michael Jordan have all made the
scene at sister clubs Axis/Radius, 7340 E. Indian Plaza, Scottsdale 
(% 480-970-1112; www.axis-radius.com), still wildly stylish after sev-
eral years in business. Most of the footwork action is at Radius, where
the bands range from house and techno to salsa. Other clubs that have
lasted more than 15 minutes in the wildly volatile downtown Scottsdale
club scene include Suede, 7333 E. Indian Plaza (% 480-970-6969; www.
suedeaz.com), a plush, laid-back spot with Art Deco design and outdoor
seating; Devil’s Martini, 4175 N. Goldwater Blvd. (% 480-947-7171;
www.devilsmartini.com), with three bars, dance floors, and a killer
courtyard; Six, 7316 Stetson Dr., (% 480-663-6620; www.sixaz.com), an
ultra-hip lounge that was named one of the 50 best night spots by In
Style magazine; Myst, 7340 E. Shoeman Lane (% 480-970-5000; www.
mystaz.com), a high-energy dance club and lounge. Pepin, 7363
Scottsdale Mall, Scottsdale (% 480-990-9026), a small Spanish restau-
rant, has some of the steamiest Latin dancing in the Valley; Saturdays
Part III: Exploring the Big Cities 
160

are especially hot. It’s elemental that e4, 4282 N. Drinkwater Dr. (% 480-
970-3325), with separate areas devoted to earth, fire, water, and air,
should be voted Best New Club by all the local media. It’s stylish to the
max, and fun just to take in the scene.
Pubs and sports bars
Many of the hopping hops spots are in collegiate Tempe, home to
Arizona State University. For a bit ’o’ the Blarney — not to mention the
best-pulled Guinness in the Valley — you can’t beat Rúla Búla, 401 S.
Mill Ave. (% 480-929-9500; www.rulabula.com), which re-creates an
Irish pub down to its last imported brick and boxty (potato pancake).
Four Peaks Brewing Co., 1340 E. 8th St., Suite #103 (% 480-303-9967;
www.fourpeaks.com), in a roomy converted creamery, has some of 
the finest home suds in the state — my favorite is the 8th Street Ale —
not to mention an Elvis shrine. A newer north Scottsdale location, 
15730 N. Pima Rd., D5-7 (% 480-991-1795), feels more suburban than
collegiate — no Elvis shrine — but the beer’s just as good.
Prefer your quaffs more upscale? Not a chicken wing or nacho is in sight
at The Grill, 7575 E. Princess Dr. (% 480-585-4848, ext. 7330; www.tpc.
com), at the Tournament Players Club golf course in Scottsdale. The
atmosphere’s swell, but prepare to shell out bucks if you want food with
your drinks. On the opposite end of the sedateness scale is the shock-
rock-meets-jock Alice Cooper’stown, 101 E. Jackson St., Phoenix (% 602-
253-7337; www.alicecooperstown.com), owned by the Valley-dwelling
Cooper. Come to this bar and grill, near both Chase Field and America
West Arena, for a gigantic video wall, huge outdoor scoreboard, and tasty
barbecue, served by staff in full makeup. In Cave Creek, Crazy Ed’s
Satisfied Frog, 6245 E. Cave Creek Rd. (% 480-488-3317), is renowned for
its incendiary chile beer that’s brewed right on the premises. The best
pre- or postgame action for Glendale’s arenas is at Max’s, 6727 N. 47th
Ave. (% 623-937-1671), which has multiple TV screens, a Simulcast
wagering center, and the country’s largest collection of football helmets.
Lounges and wine bars
The Valley’s hotels and resorts are chock-a-block with romantic spots 
to cozy up with a cocktail. Topping my list are the Arizona Biltmore’s
Chapter 11: Phoenix, Scottsdale, and the Valley of the Sun 161
A great tequila hour — or several
More than 100 kinds of tequila go down at the gazebo-bar of the Old Town Tortilla
Factory, 6910 E. Main St., Scottsdale (% 480-945-4567; www.oldtowntortilla
factory.com), as well as several types of margaritas. Perch on the patio and gaze
out at the orange trees, night-lit fountain, and, in winter, a blazing fire pit; you’ll soon
be channeling Jimmy Buffett.

swank Squaw Peak bar (if it looks familiar, that’s because Angela Bassett
and her gal pals did some serious bonding here in Waiting to Exhale); the
Mediterranean-chic Bar at T. Cook’s at the Royal Palms Hotel, with its
oversize floral arrays and cushy couches; and the lobby bar at the Hyatt
Regency Scottsdale, where fire pits on the patio serve as a dramatic
backdrop for nightly live music (see the “Staying in Style” section earlier
in this chapter, for all three). Among my favorite places to get a light,
late-night bite with a glass of Merlot are Postino, 3939 E. Campbell Ave.,
central Phoenix (% 602-852-3939), a former post office with a nice list
of wines by the glass and good Italian sandwiches and salads; the
speakeasy-style Kazimierz, 7137 E. Stetson Dr., downtown Scottsdale
(% 480-946-3004), where you can nibble Egyptian flatbread pizzas while
sampling wine flights; and Cheuvront, 1326 N. Central Ave., downtown
Phoenix (% 602-307-0022), an airy space that offers a great array of
fresh gourmet cheeses to go along with a bit o’ the grape.
The arts
Most Broadway road shows and national concert tours swing through
the Valley. For tickets to almost any event or for a listing of what’s on in
town, contact Ticketmaster (% 480-784-4444; www.ticketmaster.
com). If your chosen event is sold out, try calling Tickets Unlimited
(% 800-289-8497 or 602-840-2340; www.ticketsunlimitedinc.com),
Western States Ticket Services (% 800-326-0331 or 602-254-3300; www.
wstickets.com), or The Ticket Company (% 800-279-4444 or 602-279-
4444; www.tickco.com); one of them may have the coveted tickets
tucked away.

The Artful Suburbs
Phoenix and Scottsdale have always been the Valley of the Sun’s cultural hubs. But
since late 2005, there are many good reasons for performing and visual art lovers to
trek to Mesa — all of them involving the nearly $95-million-dollar Mesa Arts Center,
1 E. Main St. at Center Street, downtown Mesa (% 480-644-6500; www.mesaarts
center.com), now the largest arts center in Arizona. Mesa houses four theaters, a
contemporary art museum, and 14 art studios that host everything from jewelry making
to drama classes for kids. The acoustics in all the venues are excellent — as is the
talent that is booked there. For me, it’s worth making the trip just to reward an Arizona
city that’s spending megabucks on something other than sports arenas.
Tempe, which has always had an interesting, if peripheral, arts scene on the Arizona
State University campus, is about to move to center stage with the Tempe Center for
the Arts (% 480-350-5287; www.tempe.gov/TCA). Another municipal project, the
center is not quite as grand as neighboring Mesa’s art complex (only a mere $65 mil-
lion was spent), but it has the distinct advantage of a waterfront location that includes
a 17-acre art park alongside Tempe Town Lake. Performances are slated to begin in
2007.

Top arts venues
Downtown Phoenix is home to most of the Valley’s cultural venues. The
Dodge Theatre, 400 W. Washington St. (% 602-379-2888 or 480-784-4444;
www.dodgetheatre.com), features concerts, Broadway shows, stage
shows, family entertainment, specialty sporting events, and top national
acts such as George Carlin, Ashlee Simpson, and Melissa Etheridge, in
person and projected onto the state-of-the-art video screens. Phoenix
Symphony Hall, 225 E. Adams St. (% 602-495-1999), home to the
Phoenix Symphony, also hosts performances by Ballet Arizona, the
Arizona Opera Company, and more. The Orpheum Theatre, 203 W.
Adams St. at 2nd Avenue (% 602-262-7272), an elegant 1929 structure
with a colorful, wonderfully ornate facade, hosts a roster of Broadway
shows, and international music and dance performances. The Arizona
Theater Company, the Actors Theater of Phoenix, Center Dance
Ensemble, Childsplay, the Black Theatre Troupe, Valley Youth Theatre,
iTheatre Cooperative, and Theater League — whew! — all share the
Herberger Theater Center, 222 E. Monroe St. (% 602-252-8497; www.
herbergertheater.org), a Spanish-style complex that stages more
than 450 performances a year. In central Phoenix, the Celebrity Theatre,
440 N. 32nd St., 4 blocks south of the Loop 202 freeway (% 602-267-
1600; www.celebritytheatre.com), hosts headliners — everyone from
Bill Maher and the Tres Loco Comedy Show to Dwight Yoakam and the
Go-Gos — in an intimate theater in the round, with no seat farther than
75 feet from the revolving stage.
The lobby of the Scottsdale Center for the Arts, 7380 E. 2nd St. in the
Scottsdale Mall (% 480-994-2787; www.scottsdaleperformingarts.
org), doubles as an art gallery. The center hosts some of the best modern
dance, jazz, and theater in town. When the weather is nice, part of the
action moves outside to the Scottsdale Amphitheater.
The Grady Gammage Memorial Auditorium in Tempe, Gammage
Parkway and Mill Avenue (% 480-965-3434; www.asugammage.com),
wows not only with the quality of its Broadway performances, but also
with its Frank Lloyd Wright design (see the “More cool things to see and
do” section earlier in this chapter).
Chapter 11: Phoenix, Scottsdale, and the Valley of the Sun 163
Out-going entertainment
An outdoor concert on one of the Valley’s balmy nights is amazing. From April through
June, the Desert Botanical Garden (see the “Seeing the Sights” section earlier in this
chapter) stays open late for its “Jazz in the Garden” series on Friday nights at 7 p.m.
in April and May, 7:30 p.m. in June; the program changes, but you can expect the
sounds to be mellow. Tickets cost $16 for adults, $8 for ages 3 to 12, free for children
under 3.

Classical music
The Arizona Opera Company, 4600 N. 12th St., Phoenix (% 602-266-
7464; www.azopera.org), shared by Phoenix and Tucson, hits the high
notes about five times a year from October through April (ticket prices
$25–$115). Members of the top-ranked Phoenix Symphony Orchestra,
455 N. 3rd St., Suite 390, Phoenix (% 602-495-1999; www.phoenix
symphony.org), arguably the best strings and brass in the Southwest,
make beautiful music indoors when they’re not doing outdoor pops
($18–$69).
Dance
Ballet Arizona, 3645 E. Indian School Rd., Phoenix (% 888-3-BALLET or
602-381-1096; www.balletaz.org), pliés at the Orpheum and Phoenix
Symphony Hall, when the dancers aren’t making their graceful moves 
in Tucson ($10–$102). The Center Dance Ensemble (% 602-252-8497;
www.centerdance.com) takes a turn in another direction, staging con-
temporary dance at the Herberger ($9–$20).
Theater
Almost two dozen professional and nonprofessional theater companies
perform in the Valley. The major players include the Actors Theatre of
Phoenix, the resident troupe at the Herberger Theater (% 602-252-
8497; www.atphx.org), putting on a full range of drama, comedy, and
musicals, and the Arizona Theatre Company, 502 W. Roosevelt, Phoenix
(% 602-256-6995; www.aztheatreco.org), which performs at the
Herberger Theater September through May when the company isn’t
shuttling off to Tucson. Tickets for both range from $20 to $61.

164
Baby bards
Childsplay, Tempe Performing Arts Center, 132 E. 6th St., Tempe (% 480-350-8101;
www.childsplayaz.org), puts on performances that range from twists on old
favorites like Sleeping Beauty to contemporary classics such as Seussical. Venues
include the Herberger Theater Center, the Scottsdale Center for the Arts, and the
Tempe Performing Arts Center; performances will also be offered at the new Tempe
Center for the Arts in 2007. The Great Arizona Puppet Theater, 302 W. Latham St. at
3rd Avenue, Phoenix (% 602-262-2050; www.azpuppets.org), pulls lots of strings
in a historic theater; call ahead regarding puppet classes during your visit.

Area Code
Greater Phoenix is divided into three area
codes that require 10-digit dialing (that is,
the number and area code not preceded by
a 1); you don’t pay any long-distance charge
when dialing between Valley area codes.
Phoenix’s area code is 602. For East Valley
cities such as Scottsdale, Tempe, and Mesa,
use 480. For the West Valley towns such as
Glendale and Peoria, dial 623.
Doctors
To find a local doctor, call the Banner 230-
CARE Physician Referral and Resource Line
(% 602-230-2273; www.bannerhealth.
com/230care). Also try the American
Board of Medical Specialties (% 866-275-
2267; www.abms.org) or the Maricopa
County Medical Society (% 602-252-2844;
www.medical-society.com).
Emergencies
For fire, police, or medical emergencies,
dial % 911. Phoenix Police (% 602-262-
6151); Phoenix Fire (% 602-262-6297); Rural
Metro Fire (% 480-627-6900).
Hospitals
The reputable St. Luke’s has locations in
Phoenix, 1800 E. Van Buren, at 18th Avenue
(% 602-251-8100; www.stlukesmed
center.com), and in Tempe, 1500 S. Mill
Ave., south of E. Parkway Blvd. (% 480-784-
5500; www.tempestlukeshospital.
com). Branches of the Scottsdale
Healthcare system (www.shc.org) are at
9003 E. Shea Blvd. (% 480-323-3000) and
7400 E. Osborn Rd. (% 480-882-4000). A
third one at Thompson Peak, 20200 N.
Scottsdale Healthcare Dr., (% 480-882-
4636), is likely to be open by the time you
read this. For kids, Phoenix Children’s
Hospital, 1919 E. Thomas Rd. (% 602-546-
1000; www.phoenixchildrens
hospital.com), is the best. The famous
Mayo Clinic has a branch in Scottsdale at
13400 E. Shea Blvd. (% 480-301-8000) and 
a Mayo Clinic Hospital at 5777 E. Mayo
Blvd. (% 480-515-6296). Both can be found
online at www.mayoclinic.org/

Drinkwater Blvd. (% 480-946-0500); and in
Tempe, 933 E. University Dr. (% 480-894-
1797). Two Internet cafes in the Valley are
Jamaican Blue, 4017 N. Scottsdale Rd.,
downtown Scottsdale (% 480-947-2160;
daily 6 a.m.–1 a.m.), and eJoy Café, Tempe,
11 E. 7th St. (% 480-237-0569; Mon–Thurs
7am–midnight; Fri–Sat 7a.m.–2am; Sunday
10:00a.m.–midnight).
In Tempe, which is entirely wireless, you
get two hours free wi-fi in the stretch from
ASU to Tempe Town Lake; after that you
have to pay for it. And you have to pay from
the get-go for the wi-fi that blankets the
rest of the city. See www.waztempe.com
for details. In 2006, downtown Scottsdale
also went wireless, with fees starting at
$3.75 an hour; for specifics, log on to www.
scottsdalewirelessnetwork.com.
Maps
Because Greater Phoenix is so spread out,
any single map is either going to be sketchy
or unwieldy. That’s why I suggest having
two: one to put the Valley in geographical
perspective — get this map from any car-
rental company or tourist bureau — and
another map with real detail. The H.M.
Gousha map, sold at most gas stations,
supermarkets, and convenience stores, is
as good as any in the latter category. If
you’re a AAA member, you can ask for the
double-your-fun Phoenix maps in advance
or pick them up in Phoenix at 3144 N. 7th
Ave. (% 602-274-1116) or in Scottsdale at
701 N. Scottsdale Rd. (% 480-949-7993).
Serious map buffs might like Wide World of
Maps with two Valley locations: 2626 W.
Indian School Rd., Phoenix (% 800-279-
7654 or 602-279-2324), and 1444 W. Southern
Ave., Mesa (% 800-279-7654 or 602-279-
2324). Whatever you get, make sure it’s cur-
rent; the streets in the Valley shift far faster
than its weather.
Newspapers/Magazines
The Arizona Republic is Phoenix’s largest
daily newspaper, with the Tribune coming in
second in Scottsdale and Tempe. You can
find the excellent free alternative weekly,
the Phoenix New Times, at corner dis-
pensers, coffeehouses, supermarkets, 
and many other places around the Valley.
The monthly Phoenix Magazine covers
Valleywide topics of interest, including 
up-to-date restaurant reviews.
Pharmacies
Walgreens has 24 Valley pharmacies that
never close; call % 800-WALGREENS for
the location nearest you. Two Phoenix
branches of Fry’s Pharmacy are also open
24 hours a day: at 59th Avenue and
Thunderbird (% 602-978-4998) and at
Tatum and Bell (% 602-867-4060).
Post Office
The Phoenix main post office is at 4949 E.
Van Buren St., east of North 48th Street 
(% 800-275-8777).
Restrooms
In downtown Scottsdale, where merchants
want to be sure that shoppers are comfort-
able, you find four nice, clean public rest-
rooms: off Marshall Way, between 1st and
2nd streets; on the east and west ends in
the Scottsdale Civic Center; north of 2nd
Street, between Brown and Drinkwater
Boulevard; and at 5th Avenue, between
Marshall Way and Craftsman Court.
Otherwise, you have to do what you have to
do everywhere else in Arizona: duck into a
restaurant, hotel, or shopping mall.
Safety
Phoenix’s violent crime rate has been on
the decrease in the last decade — and it
wasn’t especially high to begin with — but
the usual rules apply. Stick to crowded
Part III: Exploring the Big Cities 
166

public areas at night, especially in down-
town Phoenix. On the nights of sports
events or concerts, stay with the rest of the
crowd when walking to and from your park-
ing spot. In contrast to violent crimes,
Arizona has the highest rate of car theft in
the country, with the majority of auto larce-
nies occurring in Maricopa County, where
Greater Phoenix is located. The city also
has a high rate of car break-ins, even in the
more established areas. In short, leave your
valuables in your hotel safe (and never on
your front or back seat).
Smoking
Several Greater Phoenix cities passed ordi-
nances in the 1980s and 1990s that outlawed
smoking in designated public places and in
all areas of government buildings. Private
businesses, however, can set their own
rules. The great majority — including malls,
sports facilities, and cultural venues — don’t
allow indoor smoking, but many restaurants,
especially those with bars, still have desig-
nated smoking and nonsmoking sections.
The only exceptions are the cities of Mesa,
which outlawed puffing in all public places,
including restaurants, and Tempe, where
smoke is forbidden even in bars.
Taxes
State sales tax plus the sales tax in
Maricopa County — where Greater
Phoenix is located — adds up to 6.3 per-
cent, but variable local taxes are also
included. You can expect to be taxed a total
of 8.1 percent on purchases and restaurant
tabs in Phoenix, 7.95 percent in Scottsdale.
Hotel room tariffs add up to 12.07 percent in
Phoenix and Tempe, 11.92 percent in
Scottsdale and Paradise Valley. See
Chapter 7 for information on car-rental
taxes at Sky Harbor airport.
Taxis
AAA Cab (% 602-437-4000), Allstate Cab
(% 602-275-8888), Scottsdale Taxi (% 480-
994-4567), and Yellow Cab (% 602-252-5252).
Time Zone
Phoenix is in the Mountain Time zone. The
state doesn’t observe daylight saving time.

Chapter 12
Going Beyond Greater
Phoenix: Two Day Trips
In This Chapter
 Exploring along the Apache Trail
 Heading out Wickenburg Way
W
ild West history is the thread that ties these two side trips from
the Valley, with rugged scenery and several mines — one mythi-
cal, the rest real — as historical highlights. The first trip is a mixed bag,
combining a variety of attractions from which you can pick and choose,
while Wickenburg’s lures are more focused.
Day Trip #1: Around the Apache Trail
The Apache Trail’s 120-mile loop starts and ends at Apache Junction,
passing through one of the country’s most awe-inspiring landscapes in
between. The loop’s beginning stretch is a 48-mile trail that was com-
pleted in 1911 to haul construction materials to the site of the Theodore
Roosevelt Dam. The dam’s namesake said that the trail “combines the
grandeur of the Alps, the glory of the Rockies, [and] the magnificence of
the Grand Canyon” — and he said this even before they named the dam
after him.
Part of the road (along Fish Creek Canyon) is unpaved and narrow, and
even the paved sections are two-lane and, in many spots, loaded with
switchbacks. In short, much of the trail isn’t for the faint of heart or the
afeard of heights. Consider taking a tour if you fit into either category —
or if you just want to sit back and enjoy the scenery.
The route offers lots of activities and is beautiful at both ends. You can
do it in a full day, but, unless you have the leisure to stay overnight, you’re
better off doing just the half that appeals to you (Apache Junction to
Roosevelt Lake via Highway 88 or Apache Junction to Globe/Miami via
Highway 60 East).

Getting there
Take Highway 60 east from Phoenix to Apache Junction, and then get on
Highway 88 East. Highway 88 East loops north and back south; follow it
until you again reach Highway 60 (near Globe/Miami), which takes you
west, back to Apache Junction.
You won’t find gas stations along the trail, so fill up at Apache Junction.
Taking a tour
True to its name, Apache Trail Tours & Superstition Mountain
Adventures (% 480-982-7661; www.apachetrailtours.com) special-
izes in this area. An eight-hour Jeep jaunt begins at Goldfield Ghost
Town (where the company is located) and includes stops at Tortilla Flat
and Roosevelt Lake, as well as a hike around Tonto National Monument
($145 per person, minimum of four people). Four-hour tours along the
trail run $80 per person ($55 for ages 12 and under with two adults). The
company also offers two-hour off-road trips into the Lost Dutchman
mine terrain, plus a variety of guided hikes into the Superstition
Mountains and several hike/Jeep combinations.
Want to horse around in the mountains? Rides offered by Apache Lake
Ranch, Highway 88 at mile marker 227.5, 21⁄2 miles west of Apache Lake
Marina (% 928-467-2822), go into the spectacular northern Superstition
Wilderness ($35 for 90 minutes, $40 for two hours, $55 for three hours;
closed June through mid-Sept). In the Goldfield Ghost Town, Goldfield
Livery (% 480-982-0133; www.okcorrals.com) also offers rides ($30 for
one hour, $50 for two hours).
Once a month from October or November through April, about two days
before the full moon (call for exact dates), the rangers at Lost Dutchman
State Park lead two-hour moonlit hikes. It’s a popular trek — sometimes
as many as 250 people turn up.
Seeing the sights
This trip begins some 21⁄2 miles east of Apache Junction on Highway 88 at
the 1 Superstition Mountain Museum, 4087 N. Apache Trail (% 480-
983-4888; www.superstitionmountainmuseum.org; admission: $4
adults, $3 seniors, $2 ages 7–12; 6 and under free; daily 9 a.m.–4 p.m.;
closed Thanksgiving and Christmas). The museum is a great place to
learn about the area’s Native American, military, and, especially, mining
histories, with lots of equipment donated by Phelps Dodge. It’s part of a
complex that includes the remains of the Apacheland film set, where
Death Valley Days (hosted by Ronald Regan) was shot. The Elvis Presley
Chapel is in the process of being restored. About a half mile east of the
museum, the touristy 2 Goldfield Ghost Town (% 480-983-0333; www.
goldfieldghosttown.com; daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.) is a reconstruction of
the 1890s mining boomtown that once stood on the site. Admission to
the town complex is free. However, you must pay to descend into a

Side Trips from Greater Phoenix

replica gold mine ($6 adults, $5 seniors, $3 ages 6–12); ride on Arizona’s
only narrow-gauge railroad ($5 adults, $4.50 seniors, $3 ages 5–12); 
gawk at live rattlesnakes, Gila monsters, and scorpions ($3 adults, $2.50
seniors, $2 children under 18); and get a bit more local history at the
Goldfield Superstition Museum and Lost Hunter Hall of Fame ($2 adults,
$1.50 seniors, $1 ages 5–12), with a name that pretty much says it all.
Today, the 3 Lost Dutchman State Park, 6109 N. Apache Trail, 1 mile past
Goldfield (% 480-982-4485; www.pr.state.az.us/Parks/parkhtml/
dutchman.html; admission $5 per vehicle, up to 4 passengers; daily 
sunrise–10 p.m.), attracts people more interested in hiking the hills —
the volcanically formed Superstition Mountains — than in finding the
gold reputed to be there.
As you leave the park and enter Tonto National Forest, you’re officially
on the Apache Trail, designated as Arizona’s first historic and scenic
highway in 1987. An 11-mile drive brings you to Canyon Lake, popular
for fishing, boating, and swimming, where you can board the 4 Dolly
Steamboat (% 480-827-9144 for reservations; www.dollysteamboat.
com), for a 90-minute narrated nature cruise. (Note: Advance reserva-
tions are suggested, but walk-ons are also accepted if there’s room.) The
replica of a 100-foot double-deck sternwheeler departs daily at noon and
2 p.m. (depending on the season and demand; call to check the day’s
schedule) and costs $17 adults, $9.50 ages 6 to 12, free for kids 5 and
under. Twilight dinner cruises run Friday through Sunday in high season
(reservations three days in advance required).
Two miles farther down the road, Tortilla Flat (% 480-984-1776; www.
tortillaflataz.com) looks like a Western film set. This 1904 stage-
coach stop, seriously damaged in a 1987 fire, was rebuilt with the help of
local volunteers, and today, consists of a post office, ice cream shop
(renowned for its fruity and not at all spiny prickly-pear ice cream), and
restaurant/saloon/gift shop (see the “Dining Locally” section for this day
trip). All are generally open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.,
and weekends from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m.; closed Thanksgiving and Christmas.
The pavement ends after about 5 miles as you begin a precarious (1,500
feet in 3 miles) descent down 5 Fish Creek Hill — one of the most breath-
taking rides you’re likely to ever take. By the time you reach the marina
at Apache Lake (% 928-467-2511; www.apachelake.com), some 9 miles
away, you may be ready to spend the afternoon decompressing on the
water. Pontoon boating ($25 per hour, minimum of two hours) and fish-
ing (if you pick up an Arizona fishing license, and bring your own gear;
$10 per hour, minimum two hours) are two fine ways to do so.
Drive another 14 miles to see the impressive 6 Theodore Roosevelt
Dam, the world’s highest masonry dam. You can also view it from the
1,080-foot-long steel arch bridge that sits about a quarter mile upstream
from the dam or from the back patio of the Roosevelt Lake Visitor Center,
another mile up the road (% 928-467-3200; daily 7:45 a.m.–4:30 p.m.

Part III: Exploring the Big Cities 
172
except major holidays). Roosevelt Lake, the largest body of water con-
tained within the state borders — don’t you love these carefully quali-
fied statistics? — is another get-wet-in-the-desert mecca.
The Apache Trail ends at the dam, returning you to paved road for the 
5-mile trip to 7 Tonto National Monument (% 928-467-2241; http://
nps.gov/tont; admission: $3 per adult, 16 and under free; daily 8 a.m.–
5 p.m.; closed Christmas), a well-preserved complex of cliff dwellings
built by the Salado people between 1100 and 1400 A.D. You can hike a mile
(round-trip) up the hill to the Lower Cliff Dwelling on your own (trail
closes at 4 p.m.), but call as far in advance as you can if you want a place
on the (free) three- to four-hour ranger-led hikes to the more extensive
Upper Cliff Dwelling (Nov–Apr).
As you drive the 25 miles from Tonto National Monument to the Highway
60 junction, you know you’re in mining country by the vast mesas of 
tailings — bleached-out remains of extracted rock — that you begin to
see. From the junction, head east on Highway 60 for 3 miles to the Greater
Globe-Miami Chamber of Commerce, 1360 N. Broad St. (% 800-804-5623
or 928-425-4495; www.globemiamichamber.com), where you can pick up
a walking tour map of historic downtown Globe and a map that details
the locations of the many antiques shops in town, and in neighboring
Miami. If you’re more interested in mining history, pick up a self-guided
(by car) pamphlet directing you to the area’s mines.
Next door to the chamber of commerce, the 8 Gila County Historical
Society Museum, 1330 N. Broad St. (% 928-425-7385), gives you a one-
stop lowdown on the area’s mines. For a more elevating perspective,
stop downtown at the 9 Cobre Valley Center of the Arts, 101 N. Broad
St. (% 928-425-0884), an artist’s co-op housed in the 1907 Gila County
Courthouse. Right behind the art center, and doubling as the headquar-
ters of the Historic Globe Main Street Program, the Gila County Jail and
Sheriff’s Office, 149 E. Oak St. (% 928-425-9340), serves as a reminder
of what a rowdy town Globe used to be.
On the southeast side of Globe, the excellent 0 Besh-Ba-Gowah
Archaeological Park, 1100 Jess Hayes Rd. (% 928-425-0320; admission:
$3 adults, $2 seniors, under 12 free; daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m.; closed Thanksgiv-
ing, Christmas, and New Year’s Day), brings the ancient Salado Indian
culture to life. Kids enjoy climbing the ladders into the upper stories of
an ancient pueblo, where pottery and tools excavated at the site are laid
out as if they’re waiting to be used.
As you head west on Highway 60 toward Apache Junction, you wind
your way through the magnificent Devil’s and Queen Creek canyons (not
nearly as white-knuckle scary as the Fish Creek Hill descent, but not
exactly relaxing, either). In contrast, the ! Boyce Thompson Arboretum,
37615 Hwy. 60 (% 520-689-2811 recorded information or 520-689-2723;
www.ag.arizona.edu/BTA; admission: $7.50 adults, $3 ages 5–12, free
under 5; Sept–Apr daily 8 a.m.–4 p.m., June–Aug daily 6am–3pm; closed

Chapter 12: Going Beyond Greater Phoenix: Two Day Trips 173
Christmas), created between 1923 and 1929, is a picture of tranquility. If
you think you’re cactussed out by now, think again. The rare desert
specimens from around the world, including the bizarre Boojum tree fea-
tured in Lewis Carroll’s poem, “The Hunting of the Snark,” will revive
your interest in things with spines.
Dining locally
The Mining Camp Restaurant ($$), 6100 E. Mining Camp St., off Highway
88 about a half mile past Goldfield (% 480-982-3181), serves hearty all-
you-can-eat family-style dinners in a place designed to look like a miner’s
shanty. The Superstition Saloon ($–$$) at Tortilla Flat is as well-known
for its wallpaper — business cards and dollar bills lining every available
inch of space — as for its chili, burgers, and biscuits and gravy. There’s
nothing out of the ordinary — except maybe the percentage of items
that are fried — about the menus at the Dolly Steamboat dock restau-
rant or the one at the Apache Lake Marina and Resort ($–$$; see the
following section), but they serve up great views of Canyon and Apache
lakes, respectively. Globe’s Java Junction ($–$$), corner of Broad and
Cedar streets (% 928-402-8926), housed in a 1906 building, has good
sandwiches, pasta salads, Italian sodas, and, of course, coffee. In Miami,
Guayo’s El Rey Cafe ($–$$), 715 Sullivan St (% 928-473-9960), is a
cheerful place to enjoy a hearty Mexican combo plate.
Spending the night
Whether your interests tend toward the nautical, historical, or golfical, the
Apache Trail has a place for you. The rooms at the Apache Lake Marina
and Resort ($–$$), Apache Lake (% 928-467-2511; www.apachelake.
com), aren’t particularly exciting, but their proximity to great watersports
and to the surrounding rugged wilderness is. The Noftsger Hill Inn ($–$$),
425 North St. (% 877-780-2479 or 928-425-2260; www.noftsgerhillinn.
com), in a historic elementary school building, offers mining-era antiques,
huge breakfasts, and sweeping views of the Pinal Mountains. At Gold
Canyon Golf Resort ($$$$), 6100 S. Kings Ranch Rd., Gold Canyon 
(% 800-624-6445 or 480-982-9090; www.gcgr.com), you can bunk in an
upscale Southwestern-style casita and tee off on two gorgeous mountain-
side courses. Gold Canyon is only about 20 minutes from Phoenix, but
still feels remote.
Day Trip #2: Wickenburg
Located on the northwestern edge of the Sonoran Desert, Wickenburg, is
the oldest town north of Tucson and the fifth oldest in the state; it was
incorporated in 1863, soon after namesake Henry Wickenburg, a Prussian
prospector, discovered gold in the surrounding hills. During the 1920s
and 1930s, the town churned up widespread interest in warm winters
and the Old West after it earned the moniker of “Dude Ranch Capital of
the World.” Although you don’t need more than a day to explore little

Wickenburg, the average visitor spends about five days of determined
relaxation here.
Keep in mind that most of the town — dude ranches included — shuts
down from May to October. Come in summer, and you may be disap-
pointed, not to mention hot and sweaty.
Getting there
Wickenburg is 53 miles northwest of Phoenix via I-17 to Highway 74 to
Highway 93/60, a level but wonderfully scenic route, lush with thick
stands of saguaro cactus and other high-desert vegetation.
Highway 60 may seem like the most direct route if you look at the map,
but don’t fall for it. Go that way and you’ll spend hours traversing
Greater Phoenix’s West Valley towns, stopping at lots of traffic lights.
Taking a tour
Wickenburg’s small historic district — more or less bounded by Tegner
Street on the north, Frontier Street on the south, Yavapai Street on the
east, and Highway 60/Wickenburg Way on the west — resembles a set for
a Western flick (especially Frontier Street). But this is the genuine item,
with several buildings dating back to the 1890s. Stop in at the Old Santa
Fe depot on Frontier Street, now home to the Wickenburg Chamber of
Commerce, 216 N. Frontier St. (% 800-942-5242 or 928-684-5479; www.
wickenburgchamber.com; Mon–Fri 9 a.m.–5 p.m., Sat 9 a.m.–2 p.m., Sun
10 a.m.–3 p.m.; hours may be shorter in summer), for a map of a self-
guided walking tour.
One of the best ways to explore this area is as the original settlers did —
on horseback. And you don’t have to stay at a dude ranch to rent a
steed. That said, independent outfitters seem to change every few
months, so check in with the chamber of commerce to find out who’s
around to help you saddle up.
The off-road adventures offered by BC Jeep Tours (% 928-684-7901;
www.bcjeeptours.com) are a good way to learn about the flora and
fauna of the area, as well as its history, and include a variety of destina-
tions around Wickenburg, including Box Canyon, Vulture Mine, and
Congress Graveyard. Prices start at $60 per person (with a minimum of
two people) for up to three hours, the typical trip; it costs an additional
$10 per person per hour if you want to keep going. Trips are offered
year-round; from May through October, you’ll head out in the early
morning or the evening.
Seeing the sights
The Desert Caballeros Western Museum, 21 N. Frontier St. (% 928-684-
2272; www.westernmuseum.org), has it all — Remingtons, Russells,
Part III: Exploring the Big Cities 
174

Chapter 12: Going Beyond Greater Phoenix: Two Day Trips 175
antique cowboy gear (more than 500 items in the Hays “Spirit of the
Cowboy” collection), Native American pottery, glowing minerals, and
period rooms that re-create several of the town’s businesses down to the
last detail. The special exhibits, covering topics from dude ranching’s
history to the advent of bolo ties (see Chapter 19), are always top-rate.
Admission is $7.50 adults, $6 seniors, $3 ages 6 to 16, and free for ages 5
and under. It’s open Monday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and
Sunday noon to 4 p.m.; closed Easter, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New
Year’s Day, and Mondays July through August.
All the artifacts are real in @ Robson’s Mining World, about 27 miles
from Wickenburg (take Highway 93 to Highway 71 South and drive 12
miles; % 928-685-2609; www.robsonsminingworld.com); most of them
just never had anything to do with each other in the past. But this recre-
ation of an old Arizona mining town, replete with chapel, saloon, and ice
cream parlor, is well done, and car buffs will be riveted by the antique
trucks and fire engines. Admission is $5 adults, $4.50 ages 55 and over,
free ages 10 and under. Hours are October 1 through May 1 Monday to
Friday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The Nature Conservancy runs the # Hassayampa River Preserve, 49614
Hwy. 60, 3 miles southeast of town near mile marker 114 (% 928-684-
2772; www.nature.org), one of the few places where the desert-dwelling
Hassayampa River puts in an above-ground appearance. The clear,
dependable water attracts some 280 species of birds, as well as salaman-
ders, lizards, and other local wildlife. A desert garden outside the visitor
center, which is a converted 1860s ranch, identifies the more typical
local plant life. Admission is $5 adults, $3 Nature Conservancy members,
free ages 11 and under. It’s open September 16 to May 14 Wednesday
through Sunday 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., May 15 thorugh September 15 Friday to
Sunday 7a.m. to 11 a.m.; closed Thanksgiving and the day after, Christmas
Eve, Christmas, New Year’s Eve, and New Year’s Day.
A wooden jail and a tall tale
Two of Wickenburg’s strangest, most colorful attractions are quick takes. Stop by
Tegner and Wickenburg Way, right next to the Circle K, to see the 200-year-old
mesquite that’s called the Jail Tree; I have it on good authority that from 1863 to 1890,
outlaws were chained to it since the town didn’t have a proper lock-up. Another local
legend holds that anyone who drinks the waters of the Hassayampa River will never
utter a word of truth again. In the late 1800s, Wickenburg residents used to exagger-
ate the town’s wealth to the point that the word “Hassayamper” was coined to
describe people who had a tendency to play fast and loose with the facts. From there
came the plaque (next to the Old Wishing Well, on the north side of the Highway 60/93
bridge across the Hassayampa River, just past Apache Street if you’re coming from
downtown), which tells the tale — all true, of course — in verse.

Part III: Exploring the Big Cities 
176
Dining locally
Most people who come to Wickenburg don’t do much dining out because
the rates at the major guest ranches include meals. Even nonguests 
can book a meal at the dining room of Rancho de Los Caballeros (see
“Spending the Night,” below); the all-you-can-eat lunch buffets are justly
renowned, and dinners — more gourmet than you’d expect — are super,
too. But several good independent restaurants cater to day-trippers or
to dudes who want to branch out from the ranch. Options include the
Rancho Bar 7, 111 E. Wickenburg Way (% 928-684-5484), a local favorite
that hasn’t changed much since opening in 1937 in the historic district.
At dinner, you can’t go wrong with the prime rib, roast pork, or any of
the nightly specials. Don’t confuse the Bar with El Ranchero, 683 W.
Wickenburg Way (% 928-684-5121), a low-key family restaurant with a
huge menu of specialties culled from all over Mexico, not just Sonora.
Breakfasts are outstanding.
Spending the night
The town has plenty of places to bunk besides guest ranches, including
a number of motels that get the job done. An offbeat (and definitely off-
the-beaten path) place to stay is at Robson’s Mining World (see “Seeing
the sights” earlier in this chapter), which hosts a B&B ($$) that is decked
out in the style of a timbered frontier hotel.
That said, most people come to Wickenburg to relax at one of the town’s
three guest ranches, all with different personalities but certain similari-
ties: All rates include meals (but not booze); all of the ranches require
minimum stays, especially during holidays; and all close from at least
part of May through part of October. Flying E ($$$–$$$$), 2801 W.
Wickenburg Way (4 miles west of town, via Highway 60; % 888-684-2650
or 928-684-2690; www.flyingeranch.com), is the only working cattle
ranch of the lot, although guests can’t get involved with any of the
round-up-related activities. The views of the Bradshaw Mountains from
the ranch’s perch atop Yarnell Hill are spectacular.
Kay El Bar ($$$$), Rincon Road (take Highway 93 2 miles past the junc-
tion with Highway 60, turn right onto Rincon Road and drive 11⁄2 miles;
% 800-684-7583 or 928-684-7593; www.kayelbar.com), opened to guests
in 1926 and is listed on the National Register for Historic Places. This 
12-room ranch is the place for serious riders, who will be evaluated and
matched with an appropriate horse and trail pardner. Rancho de Los
Cabelleros ($$$$), 1551 S. Vulture Mine Rd. (off Highway 60 on the west
side of town, 11⁄2 miles from the Vulture Mine turnoff; % 800-684-5030 or
928-684-5484; www.SunC.com), is the poshest of the horse resorts, with
lots of spiffy new suites and an excellent golf course. However, because
it’s been in the same family since 1948, the original dining room, lobby,
and guest rooms ooze Old West charm.

Note: Only the Kay El Bar includes riding in its room rates; Flying E and
Rancho de Los Caballeros offer equine time a la carte or as part of a
package. All are great for family vacations, although only Rancho de los
Caballeros has regularly scheduled kids’ activities and programs.

T
ucson, Arizona’s second-largest city, combines New West urban
savvy with Old West kicked-back attitude. Far older than Phoenix,
Tucson was outpaced by its more development-happy rival after World
War II. You’ll find natural attractions here — two sections of Saguaro
National Park sandwich the city, which is ringed by craggy mountain
ranges and shot through with swathes of pristine desert — but also
thriving dining, shopping, and cultural scenes, sparked by University of
Arizona–inspired energy and anchored by rich Native American and
Hispanic heritages. Add Sun Belt leisure staples, such as have-it-all
resorts, world-class spas, and well-groomed golf courses, and you’re
talking a major crowd-pleaser of a metropolis.
Author bias alert: Tucson has been my home since 1992, when I moved
here from Manhattan.
Getting There
Chapter 6 gives you the lowdown on the airlines that fly into Tucson. As
I mention, more carriers serve Phoenix, so, depending on your depar-
ture location, it may be cheaper for you to land in the capital and drive
or shuttle down to Tucson (see the “Riding in” section later in this chap-
ter). Railing and bussing it into town are other possibilities, although if
you don’t eventually get your own wheels, sightseeing isn’t easy.
Flying in
The Tucson International Airport, 81⁄2 miles south of downtown (% 520-
573-8000; www.tucsonairport.org), is fairly easy to negotiate: It has
only one terminal, with two concourses, both revamped in 2005. The

baggage carousels are on the lower level, where you also find the tourist
information desks.
You have several options for getting from the airport to wherever you
plan to lay your head.
 Renting a car: You need a car in Tucson, so rent one as soon as you
fly in — even though you’ll pay higher taxes on the rental at the air-
port. Reserving a car in advance is always a good idea, and doing
so during the busy winter season is essential. The major car-rental
companies line up in the baggage claim area. The nearby courtesy
phones, across from the tourist information desk, connect you to
agencies without booths in the airport. (See Chapter 7 for tips on
renting a car.)
 Hailing a taxi or hopping a shuttle: Many of the airport-area 
hotels run free shuttles — you can contact them via courtesy
phones in the baggage claim areas — and the two major spas and
some ranches provide transportation, but as far as the majority of
Tucson’s far-flung lodgings are concerned, you’re on your own. The
taxi queue is across the street from the main airport terminal exit.
Rates for taxi service, provided by three companies under contract
with the Tucson Airport Authority, are $4.50 flagdrop (the cost at
the start of the meter) and $1.80 each additional mile. Figure on
paying about $23 to $26 for trips to central Tucson, and from $40 to
$55 for outlying properties.
 Boarding the Arizona Stagecoach: Shuttle booths for the van serv-
ice (% 520-889-1000; www.azstagecoach.com) are located at both
concourses, near the baggage claim area. For most of the down-
town and central Tucson hotels, rates are $21 per person or $25
per couple one way, or $39 per person or $47 per couple round-trip.
To get to the hinterlands (where many of the resorts are), you pay
$40 per person one way, $70 round-trip, or $46 per couple each
way. The fare for children ages 7 to 12 is $2 each; children 6 and
under ride free when traveling with an adult (or a reasonable fac-
simile thereof). You don’t have to reserve in advance when you
arrive, but you need to call at least 24 hours ahead to get a van
back to the airport.
Chapter 13: Tucson 179
On second thought . . . cancel that camel
Tucson sits smack in the middle of the Sonoran Desert, which also sweeps across
northern Mexico — but don’t start thinking Lawrence of Arabia. This high desert
region, as it’s technically known, gets 11 to 12 inches of rain a year and is lush with flora
and fauna. The temperature does occasionally get very high (105° at times in summer),
but it’s a dry heat (the Tucson mantra).

If more than two people over age 12 are heading to central Tucson
together, taking a taxi rather than the shuttle generally makes sense.
Prices are comparable when you add up the cost of the individual
shuttle fares, and a cab takes you straight to your destination — do
not pass go, do not drop anyone else off.
 Taking the bus: If you’re traveling light and have plenty of time
(but not much money) to spare, catch the city Sun Tran (% 520-
792-9222; www.suntran.com), bus no. 6 or 11. The stop is just to
the left of the lower level as you leave the terminal. Both buses
stop at the Roy Laos Transit Center in downtown, and both go
through midtown and end up on River Road to the north; the route
of the no. 6 bus is a bit west of midtown’s center, the no. 11 bus a
bit east. The no. 6 runs every half hour, Monday through Friday,
from about 4:45 a.m. to 7:15 p.m., once an hour Saturday from
about 7:15am to 6:15 p.m.; and once an hour Sunday from 6:15 a.m.
to 5:15 p.m. The no. 11 departs every half hour Monday through
Friday from approximately 6 a.m. to 7 p.m., Saturday every hour
from about 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., Sunday every hour from 8 a.m. to 6
p.m. If you ask the driver nicely, he or she can tell you the bus that
gets you closest to where you’re staying. To find out about fares
and transfers, see the “Getting around Tucson” section later in this
chapter.
Driving in
I-10, the main entryway into Tucson from practically everywhere, snakes
around town, so find out in advance what exit is closest to your hotel.
(Another freeway, I-19, connects with I-10 in Tucson, but this “interstate”
goes only to Nogales, Arizona, just across the border from Nogales,
Mexico.) Most people who drive down from Phoenix take the quick I-10
route. Unless you hit traffic (or stop at the discount outlet in Casa
Grande; see Chapter 12), it shouldn’t take you more than 90 minutes to
drive the 111 miles from Phoenix’s Sky Harbor airport to Tucson — the
speed limit is 75 mph most of the way. The views, however, are pretty
boring and deceptively ugly; I’d hate for you to think it’s a preview of
what Tucson looks like. If you have time (about two-and-a-half hours),
and especially if you’re staying in one of the resorts on the far north side
of town, consider taking Highway 60 from Phoenix to Highway 79 to
Highway 77, both scenic. The latter turns into Oracle Road, a major
north-south thoroughfare into Tucson.
Part III: Exploring the Big Cities 
180
North or west?
Signs on freeway entrances in Tucson read “West-Phoenix” — which is confusing, if
you assume (correctly) that Phoenix is north. In fact, Phoenix is due northwest of
Tucson. If you keep driving on I-10 past Arizona’s capital, you eventually hit the beach
at Santa Monica, California.

Riding in
Although most people fly or drive to Tucson, some choose other means —
one of which may appeal to you:
 Shuttling in from Phoenix: Phone Arizona Shuttle (% 800-888-
2749 or 520-795-6771, ext. 111; www.arizonashuttle.com) and 
tell the representative what flight you’re taking into Phoenix’s Sky
Harbor Airport so they can save you a seat. Shuttles leave from the
terminal (ask where, exactly, when you book your seat) every hour
on the half hour from 6:30 a.m. until 11:30 p.m. (fare: $30 one way if
you book 24 hours in advance, $40 for same-day reservations, $58/
$68 round-trip). The vans drop you off at (and depart from) three con-
venient Tucson locations. Because airfare to Phoenix is often less
expensive than airfare to Tucson, this is frequently a good option
(you save additional money by renting a car someplace other than
either the Phoenix or Tucson airport, where taxes are highest).
 Riding the rails: Amtrak’s (% 800-872-7245 or 520-623-4442; www.
amtrak.com) Sunset Limited tootles into the recently revamped
terminal at 400 N. Toole Ave. three times a week on its Orlando/
Los Angeles run, connecting in San Antonio with the Texas Eagle to
Chicago. You need to take a taxi to your hotel (cabs are usually
waiting at the station when trains arrive).
 Taking the bus: If you decide to go Greyhound (% 800-231-2222 or
520-792-3475), you arrive in downtown Tucson at 471 W. Congress,
just off I-10.
Chapter 13: Tucson 181
Address-ing a few issues
Central Tucson runs pretty much on a grid system, with Stone (north-south) and
Broadway (east-west) as the starting points. Addresses on these two streets and the
streets parallel to Stone and Broadway theoretically increase by 100 for every block
you go from the Stone/Broadway intersection, so that 1820 E. Speedway is 18 blocks
east of Stone — you get the idea. In theory, too, the odd addresses are on the north
side of the street and the even numbers on the south — but sometimes (on Grant Road,
for example) they switch when you cross Stone. And when you get to downtown, the
Foothills, or any of the other outlying areas, all address-predicting bets are off.
And then Tucson has some invisible addresses: Seeing the numbers on most Tucson
houses and businesses is difficult, especially when you’re zipping by in a car. If you’re
heading into unfamiliar territory — and you probably are — call ahead or ask at your
hotel for helpful landmarks.

Introducing the Neighborhoods
Like many auto-dependent western cities, Tucson is divided into geo-
graphical regions rather than neighborhoods. Well, okay, some neighbor-
hoods do exist, but they’re mostly in the older areas. The newer parts
(the majority) of town are larger and definitely not strollable, and have
uninspiring designations like Northwest and Eastside. The following
areas are arranged, roughly, from oldest to newest (and thus from most
central to farthest from the city limits).
Downtown
Although no longer the city’s commercial hub, the area where the
Spanish soldiers planted their flag in 1775 still oozes character. Many of
the city’s architectural treasures are concentrated in three downtown
historic districts. El Presidio, site of the city’s original walled fortress,
has some of the city’s most opulent early homes, as well as the Tucson
Museum of Art and Historic Block and the gorgeous mosaic Pima County
Courthouse. The Tucson Convention Center complex is a bridge to
Barrio Historico, where many of the city’s more modest early adobes
still stand. This area borders Armory Park, home to the ornate Temple
of Music and Art and the Tucson Children’s Museum. Downtown’s
boundaries are — very roughly — I-10 on the west, Toole (which curves
around the railroad tracks and turns into Third Avenue) to the north and
east, and Kennedy/E. 16th Street (they switch names at Stone) on the
south. The face of downtown is slated to change dramatically with the
progression of Rio Nuevo, a massive development project designed to
reclaim the Santa Cruz River and other natural habitats around “A”
Mountain, and to highlight the area’s past through tourist-friendly his-
toric and archaeological complexes. Preliminary groundbreaking on
major Rio Nuevo projects didn’t start until 2006, however, so downtown
still looks as though it’s in decline.
The University of Arizona/Fourth Avenue
The West University Historic District developed just east of El Presidio
after the University of Arizona was established in 1891. Bounded to the
north and south by Speedway Boulevard and Sixth Street, respectively,

So why isn’t it O’Tucson?
A former captain in the Spanish army, Irishman Hugo O’Conor, founded Tucson —
which explains why St. Patrick’s Day is a big deal here. But the name Tucson comes
from the Indian word stjukshon (stuck-shahn), “spring at the foot of a black mountain.”
(That mountain is now “A” Mountain, its landmark letter whitewashed by University of
Arizona students annually.) The city often calls itself the “Old Pueblo,” referring to the
adobe barricades, or presidio, built under O’Conor’s watch.

and to the east and west by Euclid and Stone avenues, the district
includes several beautiful turn-of-the-19th-century homes as well as the
northern section of the Fourth Avenue shopping district (which extends
roughly from University to Ninth Street). The University of Arizona
campus adjoins the historic district on the east side of Euclid.
Central
Most real estate agents consider central Tucson’s boundaries to be 22nd
Street on the south, Oracle Road on the west, Wilmot Road on the east,
and, on the north, Prince Road or (pushing it to North Central) River

Road. The town conducts most of its business here, and many of the
hotels and restaurants — but not most of the tourist attractions — are
located in this area. You come across older, ritzy neighborhoods like
Sam Hughes, east of the University of Arizona; El Encanto, near El Con
Mall; and Winterhaven, on north Tucson Boulevard (renowned for its
elaborate displays of Christmas lights), but strip malls, fast-food restau-
rants, and low-key homes and apartment complexes predominate. Be on
the lookout for some great old neon signs between bouts of golden arches.
South Tucson
This separately incorporated, largely Mexican-American city doesn’t get
much chamber-of-commerce hype, but South Tucson is a magnet for
Mexican food lovers, who flock to the down-home restaurants that line
Fourth Avenue south of 12th Street, and to shoppers who frequent “the
Lost Barrio” strip (see the “Decorator fever: The other South Park” side-
bar in this chapter).
Eastside
After central Tucson was settled, much of the city’s development moved
east toward Colossal Cave and the Rincon district of Saguaro National
Park. The majority of the housing complexes here are nothing to write
home about (although many visitors do, which is why more are continu-
ally cropping up). You still find a bit of desert at far reaches of Speedway
Boulevard, but, sadly, strip shopping centers have metastasized in much
of this area.
Foothills
East of First Avenue and north of Ina/Skyline, expensive homes and
upscale restaurants dot the lower reaches of the Santa Catalina
Mountains (saying people live in the Foothills is code for “they’re
loaded”). Lots of chic resorts have staked a claim to this territory, too.
Sabino Canyon and Mount Lemmon are the main outdoor visitor mag-
nets, but locals hike other parts of them thar hills, too.
Northwest
New development is rampant in this part of town, which extends to the
northern reaches of Saguaro National Park West and the Tucson and
Education — second only to incarceration
When the 13th Territorial Legislature voted to fund a university in Tucson in 1891, much
of the local populace was annoyed. They wanted an insane asylum and prison, the
more lucrative institutions that rival Phoenix nabbed.

Chapter 13: Tucson 185
Tortolita mountain ranges; many consider its eastern sections to be the
Foothills. Two of Tucson’s most popular malls, Tucson Mall and Foothills
Mall (which, name notwithstanding, isn’t even close to the Foothills), are
in the Northwest, as are several resorts and guest ranches.
Westside
The once-pristine patch of desert you pass en route to Saguaro National
Park West, Old Tucson, and the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum is slated
for the next building frenzy. A huge Marriott resort opened in 2004 at the
east end of Tucson Mountain Park near Starr Pass; it was preceded by a
golf course and smaller resort, and a large residential development con-
tinues to grow.
Who’s calling whom a dim bulb?
If you think Tucson’s streets seem darker than those in most other cities, you’re not
imagining it. The many astronomical observatories in and around town — more in 
a 50-mile radius than anywhere else in the world (see Chapter 14) — have inspired
ordinances to help prevent light pollution. For example, lights have to be aimed down-
ward, rather than up beyond the horizon, and athletic fields have to call lights-out by
10:30 p.m. The International Dark-Sky Association (www.darksky.org) is head-
quartered in Tucson. Check out the site if you want to find out how good being kept in
the dark can be.
Some Tucson driving oddities — and tips
Come winter, tourists, UA students, and snowbirds (northern retirees down for the
season) converge (well, with luck, not literally) on Tucson’s roads, which makes for
some interesting traffic interactions. Some quirks to watch out for:
 The left-turn arrow appears at the end of the green light, not the beginning.
 To find north, look for the Santa Catalina Mountains, the largest and most loom-
ing of the ranges that surround the city. You can see them from almost everywhere
in central Tucson. Of course, you’re out of luck at night, unless you know how 
to navigate by the constellations — which, as it happens, are terrifically visible
most evenings (see the “Who’s calling whom a dim bulb?” sidebar, earlier in this
chapter).
 No matter how ludicrous the “DO NOT ENTER WHEN FLOODED” signs look most of the
year, when it rains, it pours, and Tucson has little in the way of drainage. Take
those signs seriously. Every year, at least one person who ignored them makes
the 10 o’clock news — as a drowning victim.

The Northern Satellites
Catalina, Marana, Casas Adobes, and Oro Valley, strung out along
Highway 77 near Catalina State Park and such far northwest resorts as
Miraval and the Hilton El Conquistador, are constantly battling Tucson
and each other about their legal status (they want their own services
and governments; Tucson wants their tax dollars). Part of Tucson or not,
they’re here to stay and expanding, as leisure and residential growth
creeps northward.
Finding Information after You Arrive
You find the two Airport Information Centers in the baggage claim areas,
one on the east concourse, and one on the west; both are open from 
7 a.m. to 11 p.m. (% 520-573-8000). In addition to paging people and
helping with directions around the airport, the volunteers answer ques-
tions about Tucson and distribute tourist brochures. If you haven’t
booked a room (bad! bad! — except in summer), the volunteers can call
around and make reservations for you.
The Metropolitan Tucson Convention and Visitors Bureau, open Monday
through Friday 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Saturday and Sunday 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., is
located downtown in the colorful La Placita Village, 110 S. Church Ave.
(corner of Broadway), Suite 7199 (% 520-624-1817 Mon–Fri, 520-770-
2141 Sat–Sun; www.visittucson.org).
Getting around Tucson
Tucson is v-e-r-y s-p-r-e-a-d o-u-t (we’re talking a metropolitan area of
almost 500 square miles), and its public transportation system is lim-
ited. Unless you can afford a private chauffeur or want to rely on tour
companies, you need to drive to the city’s prime attractions.
Exploring by car
If the bad news is that you need to rent a car in Tucson, the good news is
that, unless you’re in a rush, driving around town is relatively low stress.
Unlike Phoenix and the Valley of the Sun, which are loop-de-loop with
raised asphalt, Tucson has only I-10 as a freeway and, because I-10 runs
on the west side of a town that’s spreading east, this interstate is used
more as an escape route than as a way of getting around. As a result, you
actually get to see the city when you drive here (okay, maybe more
slowly than you may want to). And, except in downtown, where roads
tend toward the one-way and narrow, Tucson’s streets are generally
wide, well marked, and dual-direction. On the largest streets, center turn
lanes help ease the traffic flow. The main east-west thoroughfares in cen-
tral Tucson are, from north to south: River, Ft. Lowell, Grant, Speedway,
Broadway, and 22nd Street. Popular north-south streets (from the west)
Part III: Exploring the Big Cities 
186

are Oracle, Stone, Campbell, Alvernon, Swan, Craycroft, and Wilmot/
Tanque Verde.
Traveling by taxi
Don’t even think about trying to hail a cab on the street; the coverage
area is too vast to have much success hailing one. If you want a ride,
always phone ahead for a taxi. And because the town is so spread out,
you’re not likely to get away cheap. Taxi rates vary, so ask in advance
about the fare to your destination. Some of the more reliable cab compa-
nies include Allstate (% 520-798-1111), Orange Cab (% 520-624-4747),
and Yellow Cab (% 520-624-6611). The drivers of Fiesta Taxi (% 520-
622-7777) speak both English and Spanish.
Riding a bus
Tucson’s public bus system, Sun Tran (% 520-792-9222 or 520-628-1565
[TTY]; www.suntran.com), is clean and pleasant, but its hours of opera-
tion and routes don’t cut it for most tourist purposes (for example, many
lines stop running after 6:30 or 7 p.m. on weekends). The system gets you
around central Tucson, though, which includes several of the sights and
shops detailed in this chapter. Fares run $1, 40¢ for seniors and citizens
with ADA eligibility cards, and children 5 and under are free. You need
exact change. If you need a (free) transfer (good for two hours and two
rides), request one as soon as you board the bus. Day passes cost $2.
Moving your own two feet
The downtown historic neighborhoods and the University of Arizona/
Fourth Avenue areas are really the only desirable strolling spots. Most of
the other walking you can do is around malls or in the desert — where
it’s called hiking.
Staying in Style
Tucson has been in the hospitality business for a long time — dudes
started coming to the ranches in the 1920s — and the experience shows.
These days the city has something to suit every lodging taste and
budget, from inexpensive chain motels and historic B&Bs to guest
ranches and some of the country’s ritziest resorts and destination spas
(Tucson is home to the world-famous Canyon Ranch and Miraval). The
following are my favorite Tucson accommodations.
Christmas to mid-March is called high season for a reason — the room
rates go through the roof. Still, prices for resorts and hotels in Tucson
are generally lower than those prices in other leisure-bent Southwest
cities — Scottsdale, for example — and, in the general scheme of things,
are a deal. But for the real bargains, visit in summer: Room prices dip
drastically when the mercury rises. Summer rates are sometimes as
much as 70 percent lower than winter ones.

Don’t be surprised if you have a hard time finding a room, at whatever
price, during the Tucson Gem and Mineral Show in the first two weeks 
of February (see Chapter 3). You may not have heard of the show, but
dealers and buyers from all over the world have. The events take place
downtown, so during those weeks, look for accommodations in the
Foothills or other resort-filled outskirts, rather than in the central area.
When calling the resorts and hotels, don’t forget to inquire about pack-
age deals — too numerous to include here. Also, weekend rates are often
lower than weekday rates and holidays tend to be unpredictable.
Tucson also has plenty of chain properties that are conveniently located
and, in many cases, economical. Among the chains, I recommend the
centrally located Clarion Hotel Randolph Park, which affords easy
access to the airport and is near the excellent Randolph North golf
course; and the Marriott University Park Hotel, practically on the
University of Arizona campus and near all Fourth Avenue’s shops and
restaurants. See the Appendix for 800 numbers and Web sites for these
and other chains represented in town.
Spas
Canyon Ranch
$$$$$
Foothills
Another resort spa in the Berkshires and spa clubs in Florida, Las Vegas,
and on the Queen Mary 2 share this high-cachet name, but this location is
the original, opened in 1979 on the site of the historic Double U Guest
Ranch. The city has grown up around the facility in the last two decades,
so the grounds aren’t as isolated as they used to be, but this resort is still
a darned pretty desert getaway. And Canyon Ranch is still hot (and I don’t
mean the weather), with the latest sports equipment, spa treatments, and
medical programs, everything from sleep therapy to Chinese herbal con-
sultation and body-fat measuring. If you want to be prodded into making
a major life change, Canyon Ranch is still the place to come.
See map p. 188. 8600 E. Rockcliff Rd. (take Sabino Canyon Road to Snyder, turn right,
then look out for Rockcliff on the right; you see signs for the resort). % 800-742-9000
or 520-749-9000. Fax: 520-749-1646. www.canyonranch.com. Rack rates: Prices
per person for a 4-night (minimum) stay, based on double occupancy October– June 4
$3,173; June 5–Sept $2,380. Rates include all meals, use of facilities, classes and
activities, unlimited local calls, Tucson airport transfers, sales tax, gratuities, and a
selection of spa and health services based on length of stay. 4-night minimum stay.

Miraval
$$$$$
Catalina (Northern satellite)
The newer (healthy) kid on the block, Miraval is regularly voted the
world’s top spa by readers of glossy travel mags. It’s easy to see why. You
won’t believe that the delicious food is actually good for you (but it is).
Part III: Exploring the Big Cities 
190

The remote desert setting is spectacular; and the Zen-style be-in-the-
moment programs are less regimented than those at Canyon Ranch. Plus,
Miraval doesn’t require a minimum stay. You don’t find Prohibition here,
either; in fact the spa has a decent wine list. You can be as New Age as you
wanna be, with offbeat offerings like equine therapy (that’s for you, not
the horse), or just kick back and get pampered or play golf. New to the
staff health guru Andrew Weill debuted a series of workshops at Miraval in
2006, part of moving the spa toward a goal of comprehensive “wellness.”
See map p. 188. 5000 E. Via Estancia Miraval (take Oracle/Highway 77 20 miles north
of Tucson to Golden Ranch Road, turn left, go 2 miles to Lago de Oro, turn right; you
see the gates in another 2 miles on your right). % 800-232-3969 or 520-825-4000. Fax:

Oct $515–$635 single, $455–$535 double; mid-Oct to mid-May $705–$755 single,
$605–$645 double. Rates include all meals and activities, one spa treatment or one-
on-one-consultation or round of golf per night, and round-trip airport transfers (doesn’t
include tax or 17.5 percent service charge added to all bills). Many longer stay pack-
ages are available, especially in summer. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V.
Resorts
Hacienda del Sol Guest Ranch Resort
$$$–$$$$
Foothills
If you’re looking for a getaway with more character than glitz — or 
amenities — this is your place. A movie-star magnet in the 1940s and 1950s
(Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy were among its devotees), this
one-time dude ranch is now more resorty than horsy, but with an under-
stated, relaxed tone. The 32 old-growth desert acres in the foothills are
gorgeous, and the main-house rooms are decorated in rich, deep tones,
with Mexican folk-art touches; some of the separate casitas (literally, “little
houses”) have fireplaces. The romantic Grill boasts a cool bar and a hot (if
somewhat pricey) New-American menu. Sunday brunches here are excellent.
See map p. 188. 5601 N. Hacienda del Sol Rd. (between River Road and Skyline Road,
just east of Campbell). % 800-728-6514 or 520-299-1501. Fax: 520-299-5554.
www.haciendadelsol.com. Free self-parking; gratuities-only valet parking. Rack
rates: mid-Jan to May $185–$290 double, $355–$365 suite, casitas from $405;
June–Sept $109–$165 double, $175–195 suite, casitas from $195; Oct–early Jan
$165–260 double, $330–$340 suite, casitas from $370. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V.
Hilton Tucson El Conquistador Golf & Tennis Resort
$$$$
Oro Valley (Northern satellite)
The Hilton is a bit farther from the center of town than Tucson’s other top
resorts — but, then, why would you ever want to leave when you’ve got 
45 holes of great golf, 31 tennis courts, an up-to-date wellness center, bas-
ketball, horseback riding, racquetball, volleyball, a dramatic water feature,
plus knockout Santa Catalina views? (Okay, there’s no real fine-dining
room, though the food is adequate.) The separate casitas and main build-
ing units define Southwest chic, and the staff is super friendly. The resort
Chapter 13: Tucson 191

underwent a series of major renovations when ownership shifted to Hilton
in late 2002, but they were completed in 2006, so everything is fresh — and
serene — for visitors now.

JW Marriott Starr Pass Resort & Spa
$$$$$
Westside
A dearth of good westside restaurants and lodgings with top-notch ameni-
ties made bunking near premiere sights like the Arizona-Sonora Desert
Museum and Saguaro National Park inconvenient — until the Marriott
debuted in late 2004. The first major resort to open in Tucson in nearly
two decades, and the largest in this part of Arizona, this place has all the
requisites: 27-hole Arnold Palmer signature golf facility, huge spa and fit-
ness room, four pools, seven restaurants — including Primo, a fine Italian
dining room under the aegis, though not regular supervision, of James
Beard–award-winning chef Melissa Kelly — and more. Other not-so-standard
advantages include three trailheads into Tucson Mountain Park and under-
ground parking so as not to spoil the views from any of the guest rooms,
which are Southwest chic, but not overly large. Oddly, the city-light views
are more expensive than the desert views, so nature lovers get a price
break.
See map p. 188. 3800 W. Starr Pass Blvd. (west of E. 22nd St.).% 800-627-7468 or

Loews Ventana Canyon Resort
$$$$–$$$$$
Foothills
The most architecturally dramatic of Tucson’s resorts — the style is a low-
slung modernist tribute to sand and stone — Ventana Canyon is also a bit
more formal than the others. That’s not to suggest you’ll have a problem
relaxing on these 93 acres with an eye-popping Santa Catalina backdrop,
two top-rated golf courses, plus a place where you can drop the kids off
while you indulge guilt-free. Oh-so-tasteful, subtly desert-tone rooms are
spacious, and they even have TVs in the marble bathrooms. Dining options
include the swank Ventana Room, serving excellent nouvelle Continental
cuisine (see the “Dining Out” section later in this chapter), and the Flying
V, where you can partake of surf-and-turf on a patio while gazing out at the
18th hole.

Omni Tucson National Golf Resort & Spa
$$$$–$$$$$
Northwest
It was just a question of time before the Omni, one of Tucson’s older
resorts, reinvented itself. It started with the addition of the new target-
style golf course, designed by Tom Lehman, to the traditional one used for
the PGA Open in late 2005. Now the resort is slated to undergo a head-to-
toe $40 million renovation starting in June 2007 (to be completed in winter
2008). Pluses include proximity to Foothills Mall, where you can shop, eat,
and watch movies ’til you drop.
See map p. 188. 2727 W. Club Dr. (off Shannon, near Cortaro Farms Road). % 800-
528-4856 or 520-297-2271. Fax: 520-297-7544. www.omnihotels.com. Free self-

and Sept–Dec $259 double, suites from $389; June–Aug $259 double, suites from $319.
Rates do not include $12 nightly service fee. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V. 
Westin La Paloma Resort & Spa
$$$–$$$$$
Foothills
In the two decades since the sprawling pink Westin debuted, the city has
grown up around it, which is a good thing. There was always plenty to do on
the property: great golf, tennis, a national-brand spa, a swim-up bar, and a
separate kids’ pool with a water slide. . . . And now, with the building of La
Encantada, the area also offers great shopping. Moreover, in addition to the
terrific on-site Janos and J Bar (see “Dining Out,” later in this chapter), you’ve
got plenty of other good noshing options nearby. The casually elegant rooms
have views of either the lush grounds, golf course, or twinkling city lights.

Westward Look Resort
$$–$$$$
Northwest
The New Age meets the Old West at Westward Look. Built as a private res-
idence in 1912, turned guest ranch in the 1920s, and morphed into a resort
in 1943, the facility opened a wellness center in the 1990s, and keeps up
with current trends by offering nature walks and stargazing programs.
Other on-site stress-reducers include the standard resort amenities —
pretty much everything except golf — and soothing earth-toned rooms,
with Mexican tile and (on the upper floor) beamed ceilings. You can tell
that the Westward Look was a guest ranch because, in most cases, you can
drive right up to your door — a nice perk. Rates are often Old West, too, and
the Gold Room has a creative New American menu and knockout city views.

The top bunks for cowpoke-wannabes
They’re no longer called “dude” ranches (hey, should we blame the surfers for that,
man?), but by any name, guest ranches are a great experience, offering hayrides,
cookouts, and sing-alongs in some cases, and, in others, a chance to do some serious
bonding with an equine pal. At the following top horsy hangouts, all meals, activities,
and rides are included in the rates, which are per room, based on double occupancy;
rates for singles are higher. With the exception of the Bellota Ranch, all these places
offer plenty of activities for kids.
Bellota Ranch
$$$$
Eastside
Ideal for serious riders — or for type-As seeking the ultimate
desert getaway — this working cattle ranch features eight rooms on 65,000 acres
between the Santa Catalina and Rincon Mountains. You’re a long and bumpy dirt road
away from civilization, with only a hot tub, swimming pool (a converted cattle tank), and
board games (okay, and a computer and plasma-screen TV in the lounge) to divert you
from the main event: riding. At various times of the year, guests who are skilled with
equines can even participate in cattle drives and round-ups. Contact Tanque Verde
Ranch (see below), which owns and operates Bellota, for additional information. Rack
rates: year round about $360, depending which room you book; includes all meals,
rides, etc. See map p. 188.
Lazy K Bar Guest Ranch
$$$$–$$$$$
Northwest
A major upgrade of the facilities for the new millennium
didn’t eliminate any of the Lazy K’s considerable color. Organized activities include
cantering among the cacti in Saguaro National Park West and cattle penning, along
with more tenderfoot activities, such as volleyball, mountain climbing, and guided
nature walks. If the bad news is that the city has begun to intrude on this once-remote
property, the good news is that you can easily access loads of shops and restaurants
if you get tired of the Western shtick. 8401 N. Scenic Dr. (from I-10, take W. Cortaro to
N. Silverbell, then take West Pima Farms Road). % 800-321-7018 or 520-744-3050. Fax:
520-744-7628. www.lazykbar.com. Rack rates: Dec 20–Apr $360–$505; May and
Sept $250–$345; Oct–Dec 19 $340–$445; closed June–Aug. All-women “cowgirl
camps” available. 5-night minimum stays during major holidays. AE, DISC, MC, V. See
map p. 188.
Tanque Verde Ranch
$$$$–$$$$$
Eastside
Opened in the 1880s and one of the country’s oldest guest
ranches, the Tanque Verde has gone upscale, with tennis courts, a sauna, indoor and
outdoor pools, relatively posh accommodations, seriously good food — even a small
spa. But with 600 acres between Saguaro National Park East and Coronado National
Forest, this ranch is definitely still the real deal. 14301 E. Speedway Blvd. (far east 
end of Speedway). % 800-234-DUDE or 520-296-6275. Fax: 520-721-9426. www.

Hotels and inns
Arizona Inn
$$$–$$$$
Central
High tea, anyone? Croquet? Such civilized rituals plus the superb service
of an earlier era have kept the Arizona Inn Tucson’s lodging darling since
its 1930 debut. Some of the rooms, arranged in pink stucco casitas around
a perfectly manicured lawn, have gotten bland with frequent upgrades, but
the tradeoffs are such amenities as free high-speed Internet access.
Original artwork, including Audubon prints and George Catlin lithographs,
is another draw. The fine dining room is worth visiting for all those mas-
sive wood beams alone, and the swank piano lounge is a local favorite for
a romantic aperitif.
See map p. 188. 2200 E. Elm St. (between Campbell and Tucson Boulevard). % 800-933-

and nightly ice cream). Oct–Dec. 16 $199–$319, suites from $299. AE, DISC, MC, V.
Hotel Congress
$
Downtown
Fun and funky, with its Western Art Deco decor and gunslinger history
(members of John Dillinger’s gang holed up here for a while), the Congress
is definitely not for everyone; it helps to be under 30 and a heavy sleeper.
The rooms are pretty basic and the rocking Club Congress is a blast, espe-
cially on the weekends. But the price is right, the location is public-trans-
port-friendly (you’re right near the Amtrak station and the main Sun Tran
terminal), and the hotel’s Cup Cafe is the hip downtown hangout (see the
“Dining Out” section later in this chapter).
See map p. 188. 311 E. Congress St. (between Toole and Sixth streets). % 520-622-

White Stallion Ranch
$$$–$$$$
Northwest
The same family has owned and operated this spectacular
3,000-acre spread since 1965. If you actually know what you’re doing on a horse, this
ranch is your place, although greenhorns are equally welcome to kick back and watch
the weekly rodeos; and kids are crazy for the petting zoo and the many other activities
organized for them. 9251 W. Twin Peaks Rd. (from I-10 take West Cortaro to North
Silverbell, which turns into West Twin Peaks Road). % 888-WSRANCH or

lower rates in Sept; closed mid-June to Aug. No credit cards. See map p. 188.

La Posada Lodge and Casitas
$$
Northwest
Don’t be put off by the fact that La Posada is one of Tucson’s busiest roads,
or that it has a rather bland Southwestern facade. Beyond the leather-and-
tile lobby of this revamped 1956 property, you find grounds laced with
palms, palo verde trees, and fountains, as well as outstanding views of the
Santa Catalina mountains. Most of the guest rooms feature furnishings
handmade in Mexico; a few are done up in 1950s retro style, replete with
lava lamps. In-room kitchenettes, a small spa, the excellent Miguel’s (see
the “Dining Out” section later in this chapter), and its proximity to two
major malls and lots of top dining spots make La Posada a standout.

The Lodge on the Desert
$$$
Central
The Mexican hacienda–style Lodge, opened in 1936, has mature citrus,
winding paths, a central location — easy access to the airport and free-
way as well as to restaurants on both the east and west sides of town —
and (relatively) reasonable rates. A late 1990s revamp stripped the rooms
of some character, but they still have beehive fireplaces and wood-beamed
ceilings. Ask for a room as far away from the main road as possible; the
walls aren’t especially thick.

Smuggler’s Inn
$$
Central
Favored locally for its happy-hour buffets, this low-key hotel has a lot to

Windmill Inn
$$ — North Central
This all-suites hotel, part of a small Arizona/Oregon chain, gives you a lot
of bang for the buck, especially considering its location in a ritzy shopping
complex that straddles the Foothills and central Tucson and hosts Acacia
and Vivace (see the “Dining Out” section later in this chapter). Extras
include free local calls and high-speed Internet access, complimentary
Continental breakfast, and gratis guest use of bicycles as well as the two
PCs in the business center. A foldout couch in the separate living room of
the roomy guest quarters, plus a microwave, refrigerator, and two TVs —
as well as a coin-op laundry on the premises — make the Windmill partic-
ularly convenient for families. Kids under 18 stay free in parents’ rooms,
and Fido can freeload, too.

Location, location, location — 
and breakfast, too
Tucson has the best selection of B&Bs in the state, hands down. They range in style
from ornate and formal (for Tucson) to kicked back and low key, and in locale from
remote to central. My favorites, divided between town (well, okay, city) and country
(well, okay, desert) are listed below. Check the Tucson listings of The Arizona
Association of Bed and Breakfast Inns (% 800-284-2589; www.arizona-bed-

get too attached to any of them if that’s when you’re planning to visit.

Catalina Park Inn ($$), 309 E. First St. (at North Fifth Ave.), University of Arizona/Fourth
Ave. (% 800-792-4885 or 520-792-4541; www.catalinaparkinn.com), has the
dual advantage of being close to the University of Arizona and Fourth Avenue’s
shops as well as to a quiet city park. The impeccably restored 1927 neoclassical
home is high-tone (but not stuffy), and has very reasonable rates. See map p. 188.
The Royal Elizabeth ($$–$$$), 204 Scott Ave. (one block south of Broadway), downtown
(% 877-670-9022 or 520-670-9022. Fax: 928-833-9974; www.royalelizabeth.
com), built in 1878, is one of the few remaining Victorian adobe homes, anywhere.

Dining Out
Going out to eat in my adopted hometown has taught me two things: You
can enjoy seafood in the desert — as one of my new friends put it when I
balked at trying it initially, “So I suppose all the fish you ate in New York
came out of the Hudson River?” — and you can find great food in a strip
mall. Given its size and penchant for chain restaurants, Tucson has a
surprising number of top-rate dining options. But that’s a relatively
recent development. When I moved here from Manhattan in the early
1990s, modest Mexican tacquerias and cowboy steakhouses were the
local mainstays. Happily, they’re still thriving, but they’ve been joined in
the last decade by more sophisticated eateries, many of them in the
resorts (great hotel dining is another unfamiliar phenomenon for an
urbanite in Arizona).
Although its cuisine may be more sophisticated, Tucson is still back-
woods in many ways — that is, the town shuts down seriously early.
Prime dining time is 7 p.m. If you like to eat after 8 p.m. — but not too

Satellite TVs and VCRs are discreetly tucked into antique armoires, so you don’t
have to abandon this century’s comforts for the sake of nineteenth-century atmos-
phere. See map p. 188.
Peppertrees ($$), 724 E. University Blvd., University of Arizona/Fourth Ave. (% 800-
348-5763 or 520-622-7167; www.peppertreesinn.com), offers pretty, antiques-
filled rooms in a Victorian house as well as more contemporary units (some with
kitchens and washer/dryers) in a separate building. You can’t get closer to the
University of Arizona campus without enrolling in classes. See map p. 188.
Country
Casa Tierra ($$–$$$), 11555 W. Calle Pima, Westside (% 866-254-0006 or 520-578-3058;
www.casatierratucson.com), has a prime location near Saguaro National
Park West and the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum. You have to drive down a dirt
road to get to this lovely hacienda-style house, but rooms all have kitchenettes,
and the stars look mighty nice from the hot tub. See map p. 188.
Hacienda del Desierto ($$–$$$), 11770 E. Rambling Tr., Eastside (% 800-982-1795 or
520-298-1764; www.tucson-bed-breakfast.com), counts lush desert gar-
dens, nature trails, graceful architecture, and proximity to Saguaro National Park
East among its lures. Serenity seekers will find their bliss here. See map p. 188.
La Zarzuela ($$$), 455 N. Camino de Oeste, Westside (% 888-848-8225; 520-884-4824;
www.zarzuela-az.com), is proof that the desert can provide creature com-
forts as well as creatures. The ultimate in Southwest chic, the inn’s five romantic
casitas come fully equipped with the latest amenities — and offer drop-dead
views of nature to boot. See map p. 188.
(continued)

much later, as many restaurants shut their doors by 9:30 or 10 p.m. —
you won’t have trouble getting a table (even a good one) at the most
popular spots. Keep in mind, too, that many of Tucson’s top dining rooms
are closed on Sundays, and that several in the downtown area open only
on weekend evenings. To avoid driving around, ready to eat your arm,
call ahead; the resort restaurants and ethnic eateries are your best bets.
Fourth and University avenues, near the University of Arizona, are really
the only two areas where you can find decent food (mostly of the casual,
college-budget persuasion) just by strolling around; I like the retro-chic
B Line Café ($–$$), 621 N. Fourth Ave. (% 520-882-7575), for its casual
Italian-ish fare, and Epic Cafe ($), 745 N. Fourth Ave. (% 520-731-2356),
for its veggie selections and yummy desserts. If you’re on dinner patrol,
two other stretches are worth checking out. Tanque Verde, between
Grant and Sabino Canyon roads, is considered Tucson’s Restaurant Row.
My top pick there for a salad or sandwich is the Dakota Café ($$), 6541
E. Tanque Verde Rd. (% 520-298-7188), a nice anomaly in touristy Trail
Dust Town. And Campbell Avenue, between Grant and Fort Lowell near
the university, is lined with low-key restaurants. In addition to Yoshimatsu,
detailed below, my favorites are Beyond Bread ($), 3026 N. Campbell
Ave. (% 520-322-9965), with a wide range of gourmet sandwiches; and
Sauce ($$), 2990 N Campbell Ave., Suite 110 (% 520-795-0344), for chic
pizza and gourmet salads.
Leave that little black dress at home (though no one will stare if you
wear it). Standard attire in even the most upscale restaurants tends to
be “resort casual”: a nice shirt and slacks or skirt, no visible stains.
Chapter 13: Tucson 199
Penny wise and pound(s) foolish: 
Some Tucson food bargains
Not only can you eat well and inexpensively at many of Tucson’s casual cafes and
ethnic restaurants, but you can also enjoy some of Tucson’s top eateries at reduced
prices. Here’s how:
Come in summer. If you can stand the heat, summer is a great time to get into the city’s
top kitchens. Bistro Zin, Terra Cotta, Janos, Kingfisher, Pastiche, and Wildflower — along
with other eateries that are part of the Tucson Originals (www.tucsonoriginals.
com) — are among those that hawk summer specials, such as bargain-priced sam-
pler plates or half-price bottles of wine.
Try happy hour. Several places attract the after-work crowd with cut-rate appetizers
and cocktails from 4 or 5 p.m. to 6:30 or 7 p.m. At Cuvée, for example, an appetizer plus
a glass of wine costs $10 (the delicious calamari are a meal in themselves), while Terra
Cotta’s $5 twilight specials include the best bleu cheese burger in town, with a mound
of crispy fries.

Bistro Zin
$$$
North Central
NEW AMERICAN
With its cushy banquettes, sparkly mosaic columns, tufted-leather bar, and
black-and-white photos of jazz greats, Bistro Zin (as in “zinfandel”) taps
into a taste for nostalgia while toasting the latest fashions. The menu of
this French-inspired American bistro also offers modern spins on the clas-
sics: the chicken pot pie is made with organic veggies, for example, while
the scallops (not duck) a l’orange are sided by a tangerine salad. Many
patrons come to this retro-chic dining room — or its cozy back patio — to
sample wine flights (trios of 2-oz. tasting portions), and I have been known
to drop in just for the amazing desserts.
See map p. 200. 1865 E. River Rd. (at Campbell Avenue). % 520-299-7799. Reservations
recommended. Main courses: $14–$28. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V. Lunch Mon–Fri; dinner
nightly.
Cup Cafe
$–$$$
Downtown
ECLECTIC
A creative, well-executed menu that caters to everyone from vegans to car-
nivores; a hip but friendly atmosphere; reasonable prices; and late hours
make the Hotel Congress’s restaurant one of my favorite casual dining
spots. My breakfast pick is often Eggs and Gunpowder, which involves
eggs, turkey chorizo, roasted red potatoes, and Jack cheese. For lunch, I
usually opt for the hummus platter, and at dinnertime I always order the
terrific steak salad. Other good choices are duck with garlic mashed pota-
toes, and chicken marsala fettuccine, which I like to nip from my friends’
plates.
See map p. 200. 311 E. Congress St. (between Toole and Sixth streets). % 520-
798-1618. Reservations recommended. Main courses: $4–$8 breakfast, $6–$9 lunch,
$11–$24 dinner. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V. Breakfast, lunch, dinner daily.
Cuvée
$$$
Central
NEW AMERICAN
The white-clothed tables fill up fast at this ambient eatery with a prime
location across from the city’s main art cinema, the Loft. The airy, high-
ceilinged room — fit for lofty contemplation of the film you just viewed —
is stylish without pretension, and that’s true, too, of the menu. Consider a
wild mushroom cake starter, followed by roast duck with port wine 
and cherry sauce. Suggested wine pairings for each dish, including the
appetizers, are great if you can’t tell your chardonnays from your chenin
blancs — and useful even if you can.
See map p. 200. 3352 E. Speedway Blvd. (east of Country Club Road in El Rancho
Shopping Center). % 520-881-7577. Reservations recommended. Main courses:
$15–$19. AE, MC, V. Lunch and dinner Mon–Fri; dinner only Sat.

NEW AMERICAN
Call it a touch of claustrophobia, but I’ve never understood the appeal of
dining in a room so tiny that you can overhear the conversations at neigh-
boring tables, and vice versa. That said, I’ve got no complaints about well-
prepared appetizers, such as savory saffron mussels or warm beet salad
with mango, and “big dishes” like grilled pork tenderloin or scallops
crusted with anise seed and almond. And I can definitely see the advan-
tage of being able to buy a nice bottle of wine at retail prices from the
attached Rum Runner wine shop to enjoy with your meal.
See map p. 200. 3200 E. Speedway Blvd. (just east of Country Club, behind the Rum
Runner). % 520-326-1714. Reservations essential, even for the (equally tiny) bar.

DELI
This European-style deli bills itself as a purveyor of “Tasteful Takeout,” but
I never feel like leaving the cheerful dining room with its blonde wood and
flattering light fixtures. The food mixes and matches culinary styles —
everything from Israeli couscous salad and a chicken masala bowl to the
Texas barbecued brisket sandwich — and offers a choice of portion sizes.
Many items come by the pint and half pint, and, if you like, you can order
a single smoked-salmon cake ($2) or one chocolate truffle cookie (60¢).
Seating is mix-and-match, too. Opt for a romantic table for two, a solitary
perch at the sleek bar, or pull up to the community table. Menus change
monthly, and the staff is very knowledgeable about wine.
See map p. 200. 4122 E. Speedway Blvd. (west of Alvernon). % 520-326-9363. Main
courses: $8–$16. AE, DISC, MC, V. Lunch and dinner Tues–Sat.
Janos/J Bar
$$$–$$$$
Foothills
SOUTHWESTERN/NUEVO LATINO
Janos Wilder, winner of the James Beard award for Best Chef in the
Southwest, is Tucson’s blue corn king, and he reigns supreme over these
two different, equally dazzling domains. An elegant, soaring-ceiling dining
room is the setting for his formal French-inspired Southwest cuisine. Menu
options at Janos may include green-tea-soaked duck with cinnamon-spiced
pear or veal with Serrano ham and manchego cheese. Right across the
reception area, at the more casual J Bar, you can enjoy Janos’ high-class
cooking without the upper-crust prices. My favorites are the spicy jerked
pork and Yucatan-style plantain-crusted chicken. One common menu item:
the chocolate jalapeño ice cream (trust me, it’s amazing).
See map p. 200. 3770 E. Sunrise Rd. (at The Westin La Paloma). % 520-615-6100.
Reservations strongly recommended. Main courses: Janos $28–$50, nightly prix-fixe
dinners $80, with matching wine $115; J Bar $14–$18. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V. Dinner

Part III: Exploring the Big Cities

A taste of Mexico
Tucson was part of Mexico for longer than any other major city in Arizona, and we’ve
got the food to prove it. The city offers every type of south-of-the-border fare, from
Sonoran — the meat-and-beans style associated with the adjoining Mexican state of
Sonora — to Oaxacan, Yucatecan, you name it. Ambience spans the spectrum, too,
from down-home to upscale. In addition to the eateries below, all of which offer table
service and have liquor licenses, my top picks in the glorified-taco-stand category
include Pico de Gallo, 2618 S. Sixth Ave. (% 520-623-8775), and El Guero Canelo, 5201
S. 12th Ave. (% 520-295-9005), both in South Tucson, a separate, largely Hispanic city
that’s a mecca for Mexican-food seekers.
Down Home
 El Charro ($$), 311 N. Court Ave., between Franklin and Washington streets
(Downtown; % 520-622-1922), was opened in 1922 by the current owner’s great
aunt, who laid claim to the invention of the chimichanga. Don’t miss the carne
seca, made with meat smoked right there on the roof (well, not literally), and the
great margaritas. The downtown setting is the best, but the food is still pretty good
at the other branches: 6310 E. Broadway (Central; % 520-745-1922); 4699 E.
Speedway Blvd. (Central; % 520-325-1922); and 100 W. Orange Grove (Northwest;
% 520-615-1922). See map p. 200.
 El Minuto Café ($–$$), 354 S. Main Ave., at Cushing Street (Downtown; % 520-
882-4145), near the Tucson Convention Center, has a tourist-friendly staff that
serves up barrio-authentic food. Other pluses: Relatively late hours and a great
beer selection. See map p. 200.
 Mariscos Chihuahua ($–$$), 1009 N. Grande Ave., at Speedway (Downtown; 
% 520-623-3563), may look plain and simple, but serves up some of the best
Mexican seafood in town. Over the years, the original Mariscos has spawned sev-
eral equally good offspring: 356 E. Grant Rd., near Stone Avenue (% 520-884-3457);
2902 E. 22nd St., at Country Club (% 520-326-1529), 999 N. Swan Rd., near
Speedway (% 520-881-2372), all in central Tucson; and at 3901 S. Sixth Ave. 
(% 520-741-0361) in south Tucson. See map p. 200.
 Micha’s ($–$$), 2908 S. Fourth Ave., at E. 39th Street (South; % 520-622-5081), has
long been a favorite of local politicos and other folks who like to schmooze over
hearty Sonoran food. Those who don’t feel like venturing south can now enjoy the
same fare in central Tucson at Micha’s del Norte, 1220 E. Prince Rd., at Mountain
Avenue (% 520-293-0375). See map p. 200.
Upmarket
See also J-Bar, reviewed with Janos earlier in the Dining section.
 Café Poca Cosa ($$–$$$), 100 E. Pennington St., Suite 100 (Downtown; % 520-622-
6400), is my all-time favorite for its amazing regional Mexican cuisine. Chef/owner
Suzana Dávila has long proved that “south-of-the-border” and “gourmet” are not
mutually exclusive terms; and her sleek, chic new dining room now matches her
dazzling culinary artistry. See map p. 200.

Kingfisher
$$$–$$$$
Central
NEW AMERICAN/SEAFOOD
With its plethora of large and cushy neon booths, brick walls full of con-
temporary art, terrific bar, and atypically late hours, Kingfisher is one hip
roadhouse. The seasonally changing menu is a map of the current state of
American regional cooking, with an emphasis on the two coasts. Kingfisher
spearheaded (as it were) the drive to bring good fish to the desert. The
fresh oyster selection is always awesome; order some, and then use your
saved-calorie allotment on the warm cabbage salad with bacon and gor-
gonzola. Kingfisher’s younger sibling, Blue Fin, 7053 North Oracle Rd.
(Northwest; % 520-531-8500), is even more focused on seafood, and also
offers lunch on the weekend. Don’t miss the smoked bluefish appetizer
with curried mustard.
See map p. 200. 2564 E. Grant Rd. (1 block east of Tucson Boulevard). % 520-323-7739.
Reservations recommended. Main courses: $18–$22. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V. Lunch
Mon–Fri, dinner and late-night menu nightly.
Pastiche
$$–$$$
Central
NEW AMERICAN
Because Pastiche knows that not everyone wants to hold back at lunch or
pig out at dinner, the same sophisticated but not overpriced New
American menu turns up at both meals, with smaller bistro portions 
of several dishes available. I often order the bistro-size Tennessee bour-
bon salmon or thyme-crusted sea bass; it’s more than enough food, and
leaves me room for the yummy cookie collage in a warm chocolate dip-
ping sauce. Sometimes, after a movie — Pastiche stays open until midnight
every night — I just drop in for a draft and an order of tasty margarita fries:
lightly fried corn meal chips with a chile dipping sauce.

Chapter 13: Tucson 205
 Miguel’s ($$$–$$$$), 5900 N. Oracle Rd., just south of Rudasill Road (Northwest; 
% 520-887-3777), has been dubbed “Nuevo Latino” to distinguish it from less
upscale and less creative Mexican dining experiences. Call it what you like. It’s got
great guac, a huge tequila selection, and superb, spicy seafood. See map p. 200.
 Zivaz ($$), 4590 E. Broadway Blvd., east of Swan (Central; % 520-325-1234), is a
self-proclaimed “Mexican bistro” — which means you’ll find dishes like nachos
with salmon or eggplant with salsa. Not for purists, but nice for those who like
stylish dining rooms and fast, casual food with flair. See map p. 200.

Terra Cotta
$$–$$$
Foothills
SOUTHWESTERN
The innovative cuisine of Donna Nordin, one of the originators of New
Southwest cooking, gets a fitting setting in the Foothills in a dramatic
pueblo-style building that features art-filled dining rooms and terraces
with views of the Santa Catalinas. Try the macadamia nut–laden, garlic 
custard, served with salsa and warm French bread; prawns stuffed with
goat cheese on a tomato coulis; or any of the designer pizzas. The local
devotees — and a nice by-the-glass wine list — always keep things lively.
See map p. 200. 3500 E. Sunrise (at Campo Abierto, between First Avenue and
Campbell). % 520-577-8100. Reservations recommended. Main courses: $17–$27,
pizzas $13–$15. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V. Lunch and dinner daily.
Ventana Room
$$$$–$$$$$
Foothills
NOUVELLE CONTINENTAL
The town’s premiere foodie showcase, the Ventana Room provides an ele-
gant but relaxed setting for Philippe Trosch’s creative French-inspired fare.
The menu allows you to choose three, four, or five items from four primary
categories: warm appetizers, cold appetizers, fish and seafood, and meat
and game. Don’t miss the caviar, served in an eggshell and paired with
vodka, or the lightly roasted calamari salad with vegetable terrine. If you’re
seeking quantity rather than quality, you may want to pass, but if you want
masterfully prepared cuisine that lets the flavors of its ingredients (many
of them organic) shine through, this is your place.
See map p. 200. 7000 N. Resort Dr., at N. Kolb and E. Sunrise Drive (at Loews Ventana
Canyon Resort, Foothills). % 520-299-2020. Reservations recommended. 3-course
menu $75, 4-course menu $90, 5-course menu $105, seafood tasting menu $125 (includes
wine pairings), vegetarian tasting menu $90. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V. Dinner only Tues–Sat.
Vivace

North Central
NORTHERN ITALIAN
Vivace has long been Tucson’s best upscale Italian eatery, and it never
seems to get tired. I never tire, either, of the restaurant’s perfectly prepared
pastas and risottos — perhaps penne with roasted red peppers, sausage
and Fontina cheese — and main dishes, including pork Sorrentino, baked
with parmesan in a white wine sauce. The setting, a series of Tuscan-
yellow dining rooms with a pretty patio, is invigorating, too. Viva, Vivace!

Chapter 13: Tucson 207
East meets West — or is that West eats East?
The cuisines of sultry countries on the other side of the globe are well suited to
Southern Arizona’s similarly sunny climes. Even if you avoid chili paste and other
spices that make you sweat (and ultimately cool your system), the food tends to be
light, with delicate sauces that showcase, not hide, the main ingredients. My favorites
for an Asian fix include:
Firecracker ($$–$$$), 2990 N. Swan Rd. in Plaza Palomino (Central; % 520-318-1118),
is Tucson’s homegrown contribution to the Asia-lite culinary trend — food that does
a spin on Japanese and Chinese food without getting overly ethnic. Book a seat on
the misted patio and pretend you’re in the tropics. See map p. 200.
Neo of Malaka ($$), 1765 E. River Road (North Central; % 520-299-7815), serves the
rare — and wonderful — Baba-Nyonya subcategory of Malaysian cuisine, which isn’t
exactly commonplace itself (think Chinese with Indian and Middle Eastern influences).
The setting is less stunning in the family’s first restaurant, Seri Malaka, 6133 E.
Broadway Blvd. (Central; % 520-747-7811), but the food is just as delicious. See map
p. 200.
Seven Cups ($), 2516 E. Sixth Street at Tucson Boulevard (North Central; % 520-
881-4072), claims to be the first traditional Chinese teahouse in the Southwest — and
we don’t doubt it. This lovely, ultraserene spot offers a huge array of teas as well as
Chinese and Japanese pastries. For a real treat, book an authentic tea ceremony. See
map p. 200.
Sher-e Punjab ($–$$), 835 E. Grant Rd. (Central; % 520-624-9393), tops my list of
Tucson’s Indian restaurants. It’s plain but cheery, and what it lacks in atmosphere it
makes up for in terrific food spiced to your liking. (Warning: The staff believes you if
you say you want your food “vindaloo,” i.e., incendiary). See map p. 200.
Yama ($$–$$$$), 5435 N. Kolb Road #115 (Foothills; % 520-615-1031), dishes up cre-
ative Japanese fare in an L.A.–sleek venue with stunning mountain views from its
patio. Sister restaurant J. Nippon, 7401 W. La Cholla Blvd. in the Foothills Mall
(Northwest; % 520-498-1555), offers a larger venue and menu with weekend jazz as
an additional lure. See map p. 200.
Yoshimatsu ($–$$), 2660 N. Campbell (Central; % 520-320-1574), is popular with univer-
sity types, who like its authentic and health-conscious Japanese food and reasonable
prices. A chic back room serves up some of the best sushi in town. See map p. 200.
l’oeil ceiling). Standouts include the spinach, gorgonzola, pecan, and apple
salad; the smoked salmon on a crisp potato pancake; and the grilled ahi
with bok choy and wasabi mashed potatoes (be careful: they bite back).
Desserts are knockout, so be sure to save room. Snag a seat on the out-
door patio for great lunchtime views of the Santa Catalinas.
Note: Just a few doors from Wildflower is the same restaurateurs’ Sauce
($–$$), 7117 N. Oracle (% 520-297-8575), a designer pizza/pasta place
with great salads.

of Ina Road). % 520-219-4230. Reservations highly recommended. Main courses:

North Central
ITALIAN/PIZZA
Dishes made with superfresh ingredients — locally grown and organic,
whenever possible — emerge from the stone oven of this airy, friendly
restaurant. More than just pizza gets the hot stone treatment, although
thin-crust pies, topped with anything from mozzarella and parmesan to
fennel, bacon, and kalamata olives, are definitely a specialty; steak, salmon,
and even an apple tart share space in the oven. When the weather’s hot, I
just sit out on the misted terrace and enjoy a chopped salad — smoked
turkey, pears, jicama, and pine nuts, among other yummy ingredients — or
an antipasto with a nice glass of Chianti.
See map p. 200. 78 W. River Rd. (at N. Stone). % 520-888-7878. Main courses: $7–$13;

Keep them doggies . . . smokin’: 
A steakhouse sampler
Most of the high-end, big-meat chains haven’t yet arrived in Tucson (the exceptions
are Sullivan’s and Fleming’s). If you’re looking for low-key cowboy steakhouses, how-
ever — places from which you depart stuffed, relaxed, and financially sound — you’ve
come to the right city. The upscale McMahon’s ($$$$–$$$$$) aside, all the following are
in the $$–$$$ price range.
 El Corral, 2201 E. River Rd., just east of Campbell Avenue (Foothills; % 520-299-
6092), has been roping in Tucsonans since 1936. As the town grew, so did the orig-
inal adobe ranch house. If you’re primed for prime rib, don’t miss it. See map p. 200.
 L’il Abner’s, 8500 N. Silverbell Rd., between Cortaro and W. Ina (Northwest; 
% 520-744-2800), a former Butterfield stagecoach stop, has great mesquite-grilled
steaks (or chicken, if you insist) and gen-u-ine cowboy cachet going for it. This
place is so untrendy, the menu still includes a 2-pound porterhouse. See map 
p. 200.
 McMahon’s Prime Steak House, 2959 N. Swan Rd., south of Ft. Lowell Road
(Central; % 520-327-7463), is Tucson’s swankiest big-meat palace — and the most
expensive. The surf (terrific Alaskan King crab legs) is as good as the turf, and the
wine list is massive. See map p. 200.
 Pinnacle Peak, 6541 E. Tanque Verde Rd., in Trail Dust Town (Central; % 520-
296-0911), is renowned as much for its tie-clipping ways — the crowd just waits
for a city slicker to come in wearing one — as for its large cuts of steaks and gen-
erous sides. See map p. 200.

Seeing the Sights
East side, west side, all around the town . . . Tucson’s attractions are as
spread out as the city itself — more so, in fact, because some of the top
touring spots lie beyond the city’s borders. Check out the “Following an
Itinerary” section later in this chapter for ideas on how to arrange your
days so as to minimize what can otherwise be major road time. And
remember, temperatures rise around noon. If you’re in town from mid-
March to mid-October, try to be outdoors only in the early morning and
late afternoon, and save the indoor, air-conditioned stuff for midday.
The top attractions
Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum
Westside
My top pick for Tucson. Don’t let the name scare you; this isn’t a museum,
but a terrific zoo and desert botanical garden (with proceeds going to
desert conservation). I love coming here with visiting friends’ kids to
watch them check out all the strange desert critters, from Gila monsters
to stinky javalinas (okay, so I’m usually the one that has to be pulled away
from the adorable prairie dogs). Most of the displays are outdoors, but a
great caving/mineralogical display, creepy snake and bug house, and good
gift shop can keep you indoors for a while. All in all, this place is BIG: Wear
comfortable shoes and plan on spending an entire morning or afternoon
here. At the minimum, allot two hours.
The general advice to come early applies double here. This place gets very
crowded, and parking spots fill up fast. Call in advance to see whether the
Ocotillo Cafe is open, as hours are limited (Jan–Apr lunch 11 a.m.–
3 p.m.; June–Sept dinner Sat); I recommend planning your day around
having lunch on its terrace. The salads use herbs grown at the Desert
Museum — and you may find prickly pear sorbet on the dessert menu.
See map p. 210. 2021 N. Kinney Rd. (14 miles west of downtown Tucson via Speedway
Boulevard and Gates Pass Road; you see signs as you head west). % 520/883-2702.

Mission San Xavier del Bac
San Xavier Reservation
Even if religious buildings aren’t usually your thing, don’t miss this mis-
sion. One of the most beautifully preserved of the churches built in New
Spain, this graceful white Moorish/Spanish structure is set dramatically
against the desert. The Tohono O’odham Indians, for whom Jesuit father
Eusebio Francisco Kino founded the mission in 1692, still worship here,
and the wooden statue of Saint Francis Xavier that lies in the west chapel
is pinned with photographs of loved ones and small tin milagros (literally
“miracles,” which represent parts of the body or psyche that the suppli-
cant prays to the saint to heal). The religious folk art alone is worth the
trip; one of the members of the team, who finished a restoration of the 
mission in the 1990s, called San Xavier the “Sistine Chapel of the United
States” (and he should know — he worked on Michelangelo’s original 
in Rome).
See map p. 210. 1950 W. San Xavier Road, 9 miles southwest of Tucson (take the
Mission Road exit 92 on I-19 south). % 520-294-2624. www.sanxaviermission.org.
Admission: Free. Daily 8 a.m.–5 p.m. (gift shop closed Easter Sun and Christmas Day).

Mount Lemmon, a 9,157-foot-high peak in the Coronado National Forest,
was much in the news in 2003, when the huge Aspen fire destroyed thou-
sands of trees and decimated much of the tiny alpine village of
Summerhaven. But the mountain — and the village — are recovering:
Almost all hiking trails are open to the public again, and many of
Summerhaven’s tourist-oriented businesses have been rebuilt. Rarely does
Mount Lemmon have enough white stuff on the ground for you to schuss
down it (see the “Skiing” section later in this chapter), but driving to the
top is a peak experience any time. As you wind your way 8 miles to the

Lunch with a mission
The snack shop (no telephone) at the back of San Xavier Plaza is a great place to try
Indian fry bread — fresh hot dough topped with anything from honey or powdered
sugar to meat, lettuce, and cheese. Just looking at the stuff raises your cholesterol 20
points — but every point is worth it.

mountain’s summit, the terrain changes from desert to pine forest and the
temperature drops about 20 degrees. You pass plenty of places to picnic
and hike (ask at mile marker 19.9, the Palisades Ranger Station, for info)
and, at the top, you can hop on the ski resort’s chair lift ($9 adult, $5 for
kids 12 and under; closed Tues and Wed) for spectacular views. Also at
the summit, one of the businesses spared by the fire, is the Mt. Lemmon
Café, renowned locally for its fruit pies.

Mt. Lemmon Highway as you head north. % 520-547-7510 (road conditions);

phone); 520-576-1400 (Mt. Lemmon ski lift information). $5 toll per vehicle per day for
vehicles not going all the way up; no toll for those going to Summerhaven or Ski
Valley. Palisades Ranger Station Fri–Sun 8:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m., sometimes shorter hours

Old Tucson Studios
Westside
If you’re old enough you’ll remember the movies shot here when this was
a functioning film studio — it was built in 1939 for the motion picture
Arizona, starring William Holden, Rita Hayworth, and Glenn Ford — or if
you’re young enough you may get a kick out of the simulated shootouts
and assorted rides that have been added to the line-up. Even if you’re an
in-betweener and don’t mind corny, you may enjoy the production shows,
the (very interactive) actors strolling around in Western gear, and the film
clips of classic Westerns. Wanna take your own journey off into the sunset?
Trail rides are offered, too. And from roughly Memorial Day through Labor
Day, a honky-tonk and El Vaquero Cafe are open for dinner on Saturday
nights. This venue is not among my personal favorites, but it’s a great
place for kids to let off some steam. Allow at least two hours to get your
money’s worth.

Daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m.; closes 4pm in summer.
Sabino Canyon Recreation Area
Foothills
This area is both a local favorite — hikers, bikers, and swimmers come
here to take advantage of a terrain that mixes forest and (usually) water
with desert — and a prime visitor stop, because of the fun Desert 101 nar-
rated tram rides that take you directly to the top of Sabino Canyon. You
can walk the entire way back — it’s all downhill — or design a stroll of
whatever length you like and catch another tram back at one of nine stops.
Another (talk-free) tram heads out to Bear Canyon, where a popular trek
leads to Seven Falls. The narrated tram ride takes 45 minutes, round-trip.
If you just want a quick zip through nature, you can stay on all the way. If,
however, you want to hike (see the “Keeping Active” section later in this
Chapter 13: Tucson 213

chapter), you can spend anything from a few hours to the entire day (bring
your own food, though — you won’t find concessions). In high season, vol-
unteer naturalists lead free nature and geological walks through the
canyon; call % 520-749-8700 for details or stop into the visitor center.

Saguaro National Park
Eastside and Westside
Strange but true: This national park, which has the world’s largest 
concentration of saguaro cacti, is divided into two parts by the city of
Tucson — which means you can pick and choose the side you want to
visit, depending on where you’re staying. The western section, or Tucson
Mountain District, is smaller (24,000 acres) and more popular, in part
because it adjoins the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum (see the listing ear-
lier in this section). Combining the two is a great way to spend the day.
This side also has the newer visitor center, which gives a great introduc-
tion to the desert, and easily visited Hohokam petroglyphs (rock art) at
Signal Hill. The eastern Rincon Mountain District looks a little less dra-
matic at first, but its 67,000 acres cross five climate zones. You can also
mountain bike on the dirt hiking trails there (not so on the other side).
Hiking/driving maps are available in the visitor centers in both districts,
along with plenty of excellent literature on the desert. You can do a loop
drive in an hour or spend all day hiking or biking around. Neither park sec-
tion has snack bars or restaurants, so come prepared to picnic.
See map p. 210. Western District: 2700 N. Kinney Rd. (15 miles west of Tucson via
Speedway Boulevard and Gates Pass Road). % 520-733-5158. www.nps.gov/
sagu. Eastern District: Old Spanish Trail (take Speedway Boulevard or 22nd Street
east) % 520-733-5153. Admission: $10 per vehicle, $5 individuals entering by bicycle
or on foot. Fees cover entry for seven days and apply to both districts — that is, if you
want to drive to the other side of town within a week, you’ll pay no additional fee.
Visitor centers for both districts are open daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m.; closed Christmas Day;
paved park drives are open 7 a.m.–sunset.
Tucson Museum of Art and Historic Block
Downtown
The Tucson Museum of Art doesn’t have an especially exciting collection
of contemporary work, but the institution is on the site of the town’s orig-
inal 1775 presidio (fortress) and part of a fascinating art and historic com-
plex. The modern main building is adjoined via a courtyard to the John K.
Goodman Pavilion of Western Art, housed in an 1868 adobe home.
Part III: Exploring the Big Cities 
214

Connected to the main building by a breezeway, another 19th-century
adobe displays the museum’s excellent world folk art, pre-Columbian, and
Spanish Colonial holdings. The Spanish Mediterranean–style J. Knox
Corbett House, to the north, is a showcase for the Arts and Crafts period,
and across the Plaza of the Pioneers, on the east side of the complex, La
Casa Cordova’s two small rooms show how Tucsonans lived before the
railroad — not to mention air conditioning — arrived (don’t miss these
rooms). Depending on your artistic tastes and historic interests, you may
want to linger in some galleries and houses longer than others, but allow
at least 90 minutes to do the whole complex justice. The excellent gift shop
and the tasty light lunches at the Cafe a la C’Art (open weekdays only) are
two additional reasons to spend more time here.
See map p. 210. 140 N. Main Ave. (between Alameda and Washington). % 520-
624-2333. www.tucsonarts.com. Admission: $8 adults, $6 seniors, $3 students,

University of Arizona Museums
University of Arizona/Fourth Avenue
Okay, I know, the University of Arizona museums aren’t a single sight, but
I always think of them collectively. All are interesting, but if I had to choose
only two, I’d go for the Center for Creative Photography and the Arizona
State Museum (newer north building). The Flandrau would top my list if I
were traveling with kids. The Center for Creative Photography and the
University of Arizona Museum of Art are right across from one another,
and the Arizona Historical Society’s Museum isn’t far from the Arizona
State Museum. If you’re determined, you can visit all four on foot. The
Flandrau, however, is on the other side of the campus. You really have to
be an atypically fit museum buff to trek over there and back.
You’re best off visiting the museums on weekends or during the summer
(for a heat escape), when the students aren’t on campus and parking’s not
a problem. The most convenient garage to the Arizona Historical Society’s
Museum and the Arizona State Museum is at Euclid and Second Street; the
one most convenient to the Center for Creative Photography and to the
Museum of Art is at Park and Speedway (an underpass leads from there
to the campus). A visitor parking lot is just south of the Flandrau building.
The garage charge is $2 for the first hour, $1 for each additional hour (free
on weekends). Get validated at the Arizona Historical Society’s Museum,
and you can park for free during the week, too. Expect all the museums to
be closed on national, state, and university holidays.
Tucson Main Museum Arizona Historical Society’s, 949 E. Second St., at
Park Avenue (% 520-628-5774; www.arizonahistoricalsociety.org),
explores the state’s past beginning with the Hohokam Indians. Temporary
exhibits treat topics from medicine to fashion. Although basically an adult-
oriented museum, kids like the replica of a mine shaft. The museum hosts
an interesting lecture series in the evenings during high season; call to find
Chapter 13: Tucson 215

out the topics. Admission is $5 adults, $4 seniors and students, and chil-
dren under 12 are free. Hours are Monday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 4
p.m. See map p. 210.
The Arizona State Museum, just inside the main gate, on University
Boulevard near Park (% 520-621-6302; www.statemuseum.arizona.
edu), is the Southwest’s oldest (established 1893) and largest anthropol-
ogy museum. The permanent “Paths of Life: American Indians of the
Southwest” showcases ten American Indian cultures via excellent multi-
media exhibits, while temporary installations go into depth on particular
subjects, such as a history of the gem and mineral trade in the Southwest
(through Feb 2009). Admission is free. It’s open Monday to Saturday 10
a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sun noon to 5 p.m. See map p. 210.
Center for Creative Photography, 1030 N. Olive Rd., just south of
Speedway Boulevard (%
520-621-7968; http://dizzy.library.
arizona.edu/branches/ccp), is a must-see for fans of modern and con-
temporary photography, in general, and of Ansel Adams, who first con-
ceived of this place and is well represented here, in particular. Under the
aegis of the unique PrintViewing program, anyone can call and make an
appointment to spend an hour viewing original prints from the museum’s
collection of some 60,000 images, gratis. Admission is free. It’s open
Monday to Friday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Saturday to Sunday from noon to 5 p.m.
See map p. 210.
Flandrau Science Center and Planetarium, 1601 E. University Blvd., at
Cherry Avenue (% 520-621-STAR [recorded information]; www.flandrau.
org), is a terrific introduction to astronomy and more earthly sciences.
The Flandrau has all kinds of cool stuff, including a colliding asteroid
exhibit that shows space debris (and you thought you had trash!); plane-
tarium shows; and a 16-inch telescope through which visitors can peer the
early evening. Included in the admission price to the Flandrau and on the
lower level of the same building, the University of Arizona Mineral
Museum (% 520-621-4227; www.geo.arizona.edu/minmus) has a terrific
collection of gems and minerals, some of which glow in the dark.
Admission to exhibits is $3 for adults, $2 children, 2 and under free;
exhibits are free for all with purchase of a combined ticket to Planetarium
shows ($5.50 adults, $4.50 seniors and military, $3.50 ages 3–13; under 3
not admitted to Planetarium). Exhibits are open from Monday to Saturday
9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (till 9 p.m. Thurs–Sat except in Mineral Museum), Sunday
1 to 5 p.m.; telescope is only open on clear nights Wed through Saturday
from dusk to 10 p.m. Planetarium show schedules vary. See map p. 210.
University of Arizona Museum of Art, Fine Arts Complex, Building 2,
southeast corner of Speedway Boulevard and Park Avenue (% 520-
621-7567; http://artmuseum.arizona.edu), makes up in quality what it
lacks in size. Highlights include Fernando Gallego’s 1488 Ciudad Rodrigo
altar piece and one of the best sculpture collections in the Southwest,
including works by Rodin, Noguchi, Moore, and Lipschitz. Admission is
free. Hours are Tuesday to Friday 9a.m. to 5 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday
from noon to 4 p.m. See map p. 210.

More cool things to see and do
Not seen enough yet? Tucson offers everything from endless caverns
and more cactus to art and outer-space exhibits.
 Get flighty. You don’t have to be aviation crazy to be riveted by the
Pima Air and Space Museum, 6000 E. Valencia Rd. (I-10 Exit 267),
Southside (% 520-574-0462; www.pimaair.org), where one of the
world’s largest private collections of historic aircraft is displayed in
80 outdoor acres and 5 indoor hangars. The more than 250 flying
machines include the surprisingly low-key Air Force One plane
used by presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, as well
as NASA’s Super Guppy. See the “Aviation tours” section later in
this chapter for information about the Davis Monthan Air Force
tours that leave from this facility, and Chapter 15 for details of the
Titan Missile Museum, also operated by the Arizona Aerospace
Foundation. If you plan to visit more than one location and/or take
a tour, check into buying a combination ticket. Admission price
November through May is $12 adults, $9.75 seniors and active 
Chapter 13: Tucson 217
Saguaro savvy
Say suh-wah-roh. Pronounce the “g” and everyone will instantly peg you as a tourist.
Here are some additional facts:
 This type of cactus grows only in the western Sonoran Desert, that is, northern
Mexico, Southern Arizona, and small sections of California. Don’t be taken in by
those saguaro shots in films supposedly set in Texas or Wyoming.
 An interior skeleton supports the saguaro. The Spanish made furniture and roof
cross beams from its woody ribs.
 The saguaro grows very slowly — only about an inch a year.
 Those holes you see on its surface aren’t potshots taken by drunken rednecks;
birds, especially Gila woodpeckers, that call the cacti home, peck them out. When
the holes are large enough, they harden into cactus boots (not to be confused
with cowboy boots, which are usually a little bigger).
 The saguaro is the country’s largest cactus, sometimes growing to 60 feet or
higher. Specimens can weigh 5 tons or more, sprout more than 50 arms, and live
more than 150 years.
 It blossoms once a year, usually in June. The white saguaro blossom is Arizona’s
state flower.
 Damaging or stealing a saguaro is illegal. Plow into one or stick one in your suit-
case, and you could get fined $250 or more.

military, $8 ages 7 to 12, free ages 6 and under. Prices in June
through October are $9.75 adults, $8.75 seniors and active military,
$6 ages 7 to 12, and kids 6 and under are free. Open daily from 9
a.m. to 5 p.m. (last admission at 4 p.m.); closed Thanksgiving and
Christmas. See map p. 210.
 Go underground. Colossal Cave Mountain Park, 16721 E. Old
Spanish Trail, Eastside (% 520-647-7275; www.colossalcave.com)
is home to the world’s largest dry cavern — so big that parts of it
still haven’t been explored. Guides on the 45 to 50 minute tours
regale you with cave facts and romantic legends — like the one
about the stagecoach robbery booty that’s reputedly hidden here.
Note: Colossal Cave may be large, but ceilings are often quite low;
this site isn’t a good bet if you’re claustrophobic. If you don’t want
to plumb the park’s depths, you can still find plenty to do, includ-
ing visiting a desert tortoise display, a butterfly garden, a museum
that explores the history of the cave, as well as trail rides (see the
“Horseback riding” section later in this chapter). Located near the
intersection of Colossal Cave and Old Spanish Trail roads, the cave
is about 20 miles east of Tucson (take Broadway Boulevard or East
22nd Street to Old Spanish Trail, turn right to Colossal Cave Road
or take I-10 to the Vail-Wentworth exit, # 279, and follow signs).
Admission for Cave tours is $8.50 adults, $5 ages 6 to 12, children 5
and under are free; park entry is $5 per car (plus $1 per person
over six passengers per car); $1 per bicycle; $2 motorcycle. Open
Mid-September to mid-March Monday through Saturday 9 a.m. to 5
p.m., Sunday and holidays 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; mid-March to mid-
September Monday to Saturday 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., Sunday and holi-
days 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. See map p. 210.
 Explore more of Tucson’s past. In addition to the Arizona Historical
Society’s museum/headquarters at the UA (see “The top attrac-
tions” section earlier in this chapter), three more branches should
appeal to history buffs. The Fort Lowell Museum, Fort Lowell Park,
2900 N. Craycroft Rd., in central Tucson (% 520-885-3832), once
the digs of the commanding officer of a military installation built to
protect Tucson from Apache attacks, highlights life on the base from
1873 to 1891. Artifacts from the Hohokam Indian village that pre-
date the fortress are also on view in Fort Lowell Park. Civilian life —
and attempts to live civilly on the frontier — are the focus of the
Sosa-Carillo-Frémont House Museum, 151 S. Granada Ave., in down-
town Tucson (% 520-622-0956). The Sonoran-style adobe home,
built in 1858 with saguaro-rib ceiling crossbeams, was rented out to
territorial Governor John Fremont in 1878. Detailing how the city
developed from its roots as a Spanish walled fortress, the Downtown
Museum, Wells Fargo Building, 140 N. Stone Ave. (% 520-770-1473),
is the newest — and perhaps the most fascinating — of the three
smaller branches. You learn about the genesis of the police and fire
departments, library system, hotel and restaurant scenes, and more.
Part III: Exploring the Big Cities 
218

An entire room is dedicated to the capture of the Dillinger gang in
Tucson. The historical society Web site, www.arizonahistorical
society.org, covers all three museums. Admission to all muse-
ums is $3 adults, $2 seniors and students, free for ages 12 and
under. The Fort Lowell and Sosa-Carillo-Frémont House museums
are open Wednesday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.; the Downtown
Museum is open Monday to Friday 10a.m. to 4 p.m. See map p. 210.
 Get artsy. The sentimental depictions of Native American and
Mexican life by Arizona artist Ted De Grazia at DeGrazia’s Gallery
in the Sun, 6300 N. Swan Rd. (1 mile north of Sunrise), in the
Foothills (% 520-299-9191; http://degrazia.org), may not be to
your taste, but the artist’s former home, gallery, and gravesite, built
of materials from the surrounding desert — and especially the
small mission-style church where De Grazia is buried — are very
appealing. No original artwork is for sale, but you can get good
reproductions in the gift shop. Admission is free. It’s open daily 
10 a.m. to 3:45 p.m. (gift shop open until 4 p.m.) See map p. 210.
 Check out some more cacti. Saguaro National Park isn’t the only
patch with prickly plants in town. You can stroll along nature trails
and wander through demonstration gardens at Tohono Chul Park,
7366 N. Paseo del Norte, 1 block west of Oracle Road, in northwest
Tucson (% 520-797-6455; www.tohonochulpark.org). The lovely
49-acre desert preserve also includes a greenhouse, art gallery, two
gift shops, all excellent, and a tearoom/restaurant (% 520-797-
1222). Sunday brunch is especially big; come early to avoid long
waits. Admission is $5 adults, $4 seniors, $3 students with valid I.D.,
$2 ages 5 to 12, kids under 5 are free. The park is open daily from 
8 a.m. to 5 p.m., buildings are open daily 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; the tea-
room is open daily from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., serving until 4:30 p.m. 
See map p. 210.
Smack in the center of town, the Tucson Botanical Gardens, 2150
N. Alvernon Way, just south of Grant in central Tucson (% 520-326-
9686; www.tucsonbotanical.org), has plantings that date back to
the 1930s. A garden designed to attract birds and an area for careful
touching of plants are part of the instruction — and fun. Bird and
gardening tours begin at 9 a.m. every Tuesday, and docent-led
botanical garden tours start at 10 a.m. Thursday and Friday. Call to
find out about the many additional garden talks and classes, and 
to check the hours of the pleasant Gardens Cafe, currently open
Thursday to Sunday for lunch in high season. Admission is $5
adults, $2.50 ages 6 to 11, and children ages 5 and under are free.
It’s open daily 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. See map p. 210.
 Get railroaded. In 1998, Tucson bought the 1907 Southern Pacific
depot and spent some $12 million in spiffing it up. The result is
downtown’s Historic Depot complex, on Toole Avenue between
Sixth and Fourth avenues (www.tucsonhistoricdepot.org), which
Chapter 13: Tucson 219

celebrates the railroad’s role in the city’s growth. In addition to
what is now the restored Amtrak station, you can visit the Southern
Arizona Transportation Museum, 414 N. Toole Ave. (% 520-623-
2223), formerly Southern Pacific’s records vault. Its interactive 
displays are generally all interesting, but railroad buffs will espe-
cially like Locomotive #1673, which hit the rails in 1900 as a coal
burner. The good restaurant and crafts shop will please the less
historical-minded. See also the “Railroad tours” section later in this
chapter for area walks offered by the transportation museum.
 Check out a famous terrarium (or not). By the time you read this,
Biosphere 2, mile marker 96.5 of Oracle Road/Highway 77 (% 520-
836-5200; www.bio2.com) may be, literally, history. The famous
enclosed dome where experiments in contained living were con-
ducted in the early 1990s is in the course of being sold to a devel-
oper of luxury homes, who may not keep the original structures
intact. And the likelihood that tours will run is pretty slim. So why
do I even mention Biosphere 2? It used to be one of Tucson’s top
draws, and I thought you may be wondering what happened to it.
 Spa down. The desert is considered a spiritual place — not to men-
tion a skin-drying place (hey, if you’re going to look like an alligator,
you’d better have an attractive aura). Lucky for you, the area’s
many spas tend to both body and soul with an array of treatments.
Most of the spas at Tucson’s resorts have day-visit options; my top
picks are the spas at Miraval, Westin La Paloma (an Elizabeth
Arden Red Door spa), JW Marriott Starr Pass, and Omni Tucson
National (all listed in the “Staying in Style” section earlier in this
chapter). Of the independent day spas, Gadabout (www.gadabout.
com) has the most locations (six, including one for men at 2951 N.
Swan; % 520-325-3300; check the Yellow Pages or the spa’s Web
site for the one nearest you), but the town’s poshest independent
operation, with the most interesting treatments, is Touch of
Tranquility, 6884 E. Sunrise Dr., Suite 150, in the Foothills (% 520-
615-9608; www.touchoftranquility.com). Treatments range
from $20 for a basic manicure at Gadabout to $425 for five hours —
including aromatherapy message, Dead Sea body masque, facial,
manicure, pedicure, and lunch — at Omni Tucson National. A full
day at Miraval can run you more than a grand. See map p. 188.

Neophyte neck kneaders
One of the most prestigious massage schools in the country, Tucson’s Desert Institute
of the Healing Arts, 140 E. Fourth St. (% 520-792-1191; www.diha.org), offers hour-
long Swedish and shiatsu massages for $30 if you’re willing to serve as a student
guinea pig, er, subject (it’s $50 if you go with one of the pros). These cut-rate pummel-
ing sessions are available Monday through Thursday (times vary) and all day Saturday.

Keeping Active
Ways to play in Tucson’s balmy weather abound — but don’t play too
long or too hard without the proper precautions, such as hydration and
sun protection.
Biking
The best of Tucson’s many bicycle-friendly areas include Sabino Canyon
with a paved path to the top — uphill, but very scenic (% 520-749-8700;
the path is open to bicyclists only from 5 p.m.— 9 a.m., except Wed and
Sat, when bikers are not permitted) and Saguaro National Park East,
where hikers share several trails with mountain bikers. See “The top attrac-
tions” section earlier in this chapter for both locations. Another option
is Rillito River Park, a level, 4-mile trail that runs parallel to River Road
between Campbell Avenue and La Cholla Boulevard along a (usually dry)
riverbed. The Tucson Transportation Department (% 520-791-4372;
http://dot.ci.tucson.az.us) can mail you a city bike map, or you
can also pick one up at the downtown office of the Pima Association of
Chapter 13: Tucson 221
Also getting kudos from kids . . .
Along with the other kid-friendly spots that I describe in this chapter, families have a
few more options.
Ideal for a central city afternoon outing, Reid Park Zoo, 1030 S. Randolph Way, 
west of Alvernon Way and north of 22nd Street, (Central; % 520-791-4022; www.
tucsonzoo.org), is just big enough to keep kids occupied for a couple of hours, but
not too large to completely exhaust them (or you). If your feet start hurting anyway,
consider the train ride ($2 extra). The baby animal displays always score major points.
Admission: $5 adults, $4 seniors, $2 ages 2–14 accompanied by an adult, under 2 free.
Daily 9 a.m.–4 p.m.; closed Christmas. See map p. 210.
At the Tucson Children’s Museum, 200 S. Sixth Ave., at 13th St. (Downtown; % 520-
792-9985; www.tucsonchildrensmuseum.org), your energetic offspring can
work off excess juice while finding out everything from the human body to electricity.
Kids can watch themselves on TV in the ZOOMzone, or drum to their heart’s content
in the soundproofed Rhythm Section. This building has a long history of learning: It
was Tucson’s first public library. Admission: $5.50 adults, $4.50 seniors, $3.50 ages 2–16;
free for everyone third Sun of each month. Tues–Sat 10 a.m.–5 p.m., Sun noon–5 p.m.;
closed New Year’s Day, Easter, Thanksgiving, Christmas. See map p. 210.
Real and re-created fossils, artwork, dioramas, and other “touch and learn” exhibits
fill the T-Rex Museum, 100 E. Drachman St., (Downtown; % 520-792-2884; www.

sambabike.org), organizes frequent group rides to which visitors are
welcome.
Bird-watching
Southern Arizona is a bird-lover’s mecca. Although the greatest concen-
trations of birds flock to areas southeast of Tucson (see Chapter 15), the
feathered ones also take to more citified spots. The best source for local
birding information is the Tucson Audubon Society, which has an office
and nature shop near UA at 300 E. University Blvd., Suite 120 (% 520-
629-0510; www.tucsonaudubon.org). One of the society’s publications,
Finding Birds in Southeast Arizona, includes two chapters on urban bird
hangouts and, during high season, members run field trips in and
around Tucson and southeastern Arizona.
Golfing
Desert, traditional, resort, municipal — Tucson has golf courses to sat-
isfy every duffer’s taste and pocketbook. To get the lowdown on the
local courses, get a free copy of The Official Arizona Golf Guide and
Directory in advance from the Tucson Convention and Visitors’ Bureau
(see the “Fast Facts: Tucson” section later in this chapter). The guides
are also available at resorts, golf courses, and the Tucson Visitors Center
(see the “Finding Information after You Arrive” section earlier in this
chapter).
For last-minute reservations in high season, contact Stand-by Golf
(% 520-882-2665), where your procrastination doesn’t cost you any-
thing (the golf courses pick up the tab). The service is closed in summer,
when getting a tee time is no problem.
Speaking of which, if you’re an early riser or don’t mind teeing off in the
late afternoon (the periods of the day when the heat is bearable), con-
sider traveling to Tucson from June through August. During these months,
greens fees and room rates at the golf resorts dip drastically. I give you
brief rundowns of the types of courses in the following list. See also my
tips for desert golf, often called target golf, in Chapter 11.
 Municipal courses: Tucson’s five municipal courses are far-from-
seedy (although they’re often seeded) city greens. In fact, the flag-
ship of these bargain courses, Randolph North, hosts the annual
LPGA tours, while Fred Enke stands out for being an urban target
course. For locations, greens fees (which range from $45–$65 in
Part III: Exploring the Big Cities 
222

high season, with cart, $23–$25 in summer), and reservations, con-
tact the Tucson Parks and Recreation Department (% 520-791-
4653 or 520-791-4336 [recorded information only]; www.tucson
citygolf.com). To avoid disappointment, book the municipal
courses at least a week in advance.
If you play the municipal courses after 3 p.m. from November
through January, for as many holes as you can see until it gets dark
(generally about 7 or 7:30 p.m. — Arizona doesn’t go on daylight
savings time), fees are greatly reduced. And the summer specials,
after Memorial Day, are outstanding.
 Public courses: A couple of Tucson’s newer nonresort courses,
both desert track and extremely scenic, are already among its most
popular public places to get teed off. Arizona National Golf Club,
9777 E. Sabino Greens Dr., in the Foothills (% 520-749-3636; www.
arizonanationalgolfclub.com), designed by Robert Trent Jones
Jr., is the most convenient to town of the two. The club’s green fees
range from $135 to $165 in winter, $55 to $65 in summer, and $75 
to $95 in spring and fall. The Golf Club at Vistoso, 955 W. Vistoso
Highlands Dr., Oro Valley, north of Tucson (% 520-797-9900; www.
vistosogolf.com), a Tom Weiskopf creation, was selected as No. 1
in Tucson by Golf Digest. In winter, you pay $169 to play at Vistoso,
in summer $49. In Green Valley, a (largely) retirement community
south of Tucson, The Haven Public Golf Course, 110 N. Abrego 
Dr. (% 520-625-4281), has a good, traditional layout that’s very
playable for all levels, not to mention reasonable: Green fees are
only $45 in high season, $20 in summer. All these courses offer dis-
counts on late-afternoon play during the off season, and many have
them in winter, too.
 Resort courses: The Westin La Paloma has a guests-only policy for
its greens, but you can play at all the other resorts even if you’re
not staying there. Remember, however, that guests get first dibs on
the prime tee times. The two Tom Fazio-designed Ventana Canyon
courses at 6200 N. Clubhouse Lane, also in the Foothills (% 520-
577-4015; www.ventanacanyonclub.com), are renowned for their
spectacular scenery and are the most popular of the resort desert
target courses. Green fees: $225 in winter, $160 in spring and fall, $85
in summer. Locals and visitors have long flocked to the mix-and-
match (but mostly traditional) greens at Omni Tucson National
Golf Resort and Spa, 2727 W. Club Dr., northwest Tucson (% 520-
297-2271; www.tucsonnational.com), site of the annual PGA’s
Chrysler Classic Tour; now they can also play the resort’s Tom
Lehman–designed desert course, opened in late 2005. Rates for
nonguests at all the courses range from $65 in summer to $115 in
the shoulder seasons and $180 in high season.
Hiking
Saguaro National Park, Sabino Canyon, and Mount Lemmon (see “The
top attractions” section earlier in this chapter for all three) are Tucson
Chapter 13: Tucson 223

trekker favorites. If you’re seeking (relative) solitude, the Eastern district
of the national park is your best bet. Other options include Catalina
State Park, 11570 N. Oracle Rd., 9 miles north of the city (% 520-628-
5798; www.azparks.gov/Parks/parkhtml/catalina.html; admission
$6 per car), a highlight of which is the Romero Ruin trail that leads to an
ancient Indian ruins; and Tucson Mountain Park, 8451 W. McCain Loop
Rd. (% 520-883-4200; www.pima.gov/pksrec/natres/tucmts/tumtpk.
html), which has no visitor center (or entry fee). You see signs for
Tucson Mountain Park just before you come to Saguaro National Park
West. You can usually hitch a hike with the local chapter of the Sierra
Club (% 520-620-6401; http://arizona.sierraclub.org), which
tends to head for the (foot)hills most weekends in high season (if you
want to go on your own, log on to http://Arizona.sierraclub.org/
trail_guide, which details a variety of Tucson hikes. The best all-
around trail resource is the Tucson Hiking Guide by Betty Leavengood,
which rates hikes by difficulty and discusses details such as terrain. You
can pick up a copy at either branch of the Summit Hut, 5045 E. Speedway
Blvd. (% 520-325-1554) or 605 E. Wetmore Rd. (% 520-888-1000), also
good sources for hiking equipment.
Tucson’s super dry air is deceptive; just because you’re not sweating
doesn’t mean you’re not getting dehydrated. Take plenty of water with
you — about 2 to 4 quarts for a standard day hike, double that on really
hot days — and keep on drinking, even when you don’t think you’re
thirsty. Try to down about 20 ounces of fluids — nothing carbonated,
caffeinated, or alcoholic, please — two hours before you get started and
then take a hearty swig from your water bottle every 15 minutes.
Horseback riding
No matter if the closest you’ve come to a horse is watching Mr. Ed reruns
on TV, this town has a mount with your brand on it. Pusch Ridge Stables,
13700 N. Oracle Rd. (% 520-825-1664), backed dramatically up against
the Santa Catalinas north of Tucson, offers everything from easy group
trots through the desert ($30 for one hour, $45 for two hours, $35 for 90-
minute sunset rides) to advanced private rides ($50 per hour). You can
find your bliss — or at least have fun — at Cocaraque Ranch, 6255 N.
Diamond Hills Lane (% 520-682-8594; www.cocoraque.com), a working
cattle ranch on the west side of town near Old Tucson Studios. You have
to gather together a group of at least ten if you want to take part in a
cattle drive (rates, from about $95 per person, depend on group size;
Sept–May), but you can ride around with a guide until the cows come
home — or until your money runs out (trail rides cost $25 for one hour,
$35 for two hours, or $85 for a full-day brown-bag ride). Follow an old
stagecoach route from the historic ranch in Colossal Cave Mountain Park
Stables 16721 E. Old Spanish Trail (% 520-647-3450; www.colossalcave.
com/explore.html). You pay $27 for the first hour, and $20 for each
additional hour, up to four; sunset rides are $42. Breakfast or lunch runs
you $15 more, dinner another $20. If you get a group of at least 6 together,
cattle drives are available year round ($75 per person). See the “More
Part III: Exploring the Big Cities 
224

cool things to see and do” section earlier in this chapter, for directions
to the park, on the far east side of town.
Skiing
Yes, Virginia, there is snow in southern Arizona — sometimes. But
because the Mt. Lemmon Ski Valley, at the top of Mt. Lemmon (see “The
top attractions” section earlier in this chapter), has no machines to help
Mother Nature along with the white stuff, chances are good that you may
not be able to do any schussing during your visit. (Call % 520-576-1321
to see if a live person answers the phone — a good sign — or 520-576-
1400 for a recorded snow report.) When the ski area is open, lift tickets
cost $35 for an adult’s all-day pass, $30 for an adult half-day pass start-
ing at 12:30 p.m.; $16 for an all-day pass for ages 12 and under, $13 after
12:30 p.m. Instruction starts at $55 for a 90-minute private lesson, and
$19 for a 90-minute group lesson. A $55 first-time skier’s package ($33 for
children under 12) includes equipment rental, a lesson, and a lift pass
upon completion of the lesson. The Valley offers 22 runs, ranging from
beginner to advanced. And this mountain isn’t a snowboard-free zone;
you can rent and use them here as well.
Mount Lemmon isn’t the place for serious skiers; you’ll be disappointed
if you want expert slopes. If you just want a quick downhill fix, however,
you can’t beat going swimming in the morning and then hitting the
slopes in the afternoon.
Tennis
Although the resort courts are restricted to hotel guests — you find the
most courts at Loews Ventana Canyon, Sheraton Tucson El Conquistador,
Westin La Paloma, Westward Look, and Canyon Ranch (see the “Staying
in Style” section earlier in this chapter) — good public courts abound.
Laying claim to be the largest public facility in the Southwest, Randolph
Tennis Center, 50 S. Alvernon Way (% 520-791-4896; www.randolph
tenniscenter.com), has 25 tennis courts and 11 racquetball courts, 
all night lit. Fort Lowell Park, 2900 N. Craycroft Rd. (% 520-791-2584),
and Himmel Park, 1000 N. Tucson Blvd. (% 520-791-3276), offer eight
lighted courts each. All are in central Tucson and all charge ridiculously
reasonable fees: $2.50 per adult per 90 minutes. Fees at Randolph are
$10 per court for night lighting, $6 at Ft. Lowell and Himmel Park. All
three have lower fees for ages 16 and under and for seniors. None of the
facilities accepts reservations: First come, first served (or serving). The
least crowded times to play are from about 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., which is, of
course, when the temperature is the most uncomfortably warm.
Rooting for the Home Team: Spectator Sports
Put some spring (training) into your step. Tucson is the only city in the
country to host three major-league baseball teams for spring training.
Chapter 13: Tucson 225

Tickets can be hard to get. Try to nab seats as soon as you know when
you’ll be in town.
The Chicago White Sox and the Arizona Diamondbacks go to bat during
the month of March at the Tucson Electric Park, 2500 E. Ajo Way, near
the airport (% 866-672-1343; www.tucsonbaseball.com). Tickets run
$4 to $16. Vying for fans of America’s favorite pastime in March, the
Colorado Rockies (% 800-388-7625; http://colorado.rockies.mlb.
com) perfect their pitch at Hi-Corbett Field, 3400 E. Camino Campestre in
Reid Park (S. Country Club and E. 22nd Street), an intimate old-time
venue. Prices range from $2 to $13.
The Cactus Leaguers turn over the mound at Tucson Electric Park from
April through August to the Tucson Sidewinders (% 520-434-1021; www.
tucsonsidewinders.com), the Diamondbacks’ AAA team (clearly, this
franchise assumes that reptilian names won’t rattle the fans). Ticket
prices generally run $5 to $9 but a variety of promotions, from Two Dollar
Tuesdays to Free Souvenir Saturdays, bring prices down or add perks.
Seeing Tucson by Guided Tour
If you don’t drive or just don’t want the hassle of trying to find your way
around a large, new city, you have some good general sightseeing options.
Want to focus on some special interests? In addition to these tours, you
can find more in this chapter’s listings for Sabino Canyon and Tucson
Museum of Art (see “The top attractions” section), Tucson Botanical
Gardens (see the “More cool things to see and do” section), and Tucson
Audubon Society (see the “Keeping Active” section).
General bus tours
Great Western Tours (% 520-572-1660; www.gwtours.net) offers the
most Tucson excursions, ranging from three-hour city tours for $45 per
person to all-day trips to Tombstone and Bisbee (see Chapter 15) for $105.
Archaeology tours
Enjoy channeling ancient civilizations (if only on the Discovery channel)?
Dig in! Old Pueblo Archaeology (% 520-798-1201; www.oldpueblo.org)
lets you discover the ropes — or the rocks — on an ancient Indian vil-
lage in Marana, north of Tucson. Participants in the Dig for a Day pro-
gram must be at least 12 years old, and the fee is $38. Advance
reservations are required.
Aviation tours
Get on a higher plane with a bus tour of AMARC (Aircraft Maintenance
and Regeneration Center), a 2,700-acre facility at the Davis Monthan Air
Force base, which hosts more than 4,000 aircraft. Departure times for
Part III: Exploring the Big Cities 
226

the tours, which take about an hour and depart from the Pima Air &
Space Museum (see the “More cool things to see and do” section earlier
in this chapter), vary seasonally, but tours are offered Monday through
Friday, excluding holidays. Phone ahead to get information and to make
reservations (% 520-574-0462, ext. 2), which are strongly advised. Cost
is $6 for adults and $3 for ages 12 and under.
Desert tours
Sunshine Jeep Tours, 9040 N. Oracle Rd., Suite D (% 520-742-1943; www.
sunshinejeeptours.com), gives you a great introduction to the desert
in the Tortolita Mountains northwest of Tucson. You’re off-roaded to an
archaeological site with ancient petroglyphs, and you get the dirt on all
the local flora and fauna (snake handling optional). A three to three-and-
a-half-hour tour costs $130 for the first two people, then $55 adults, $35
for ages 11 to 15, $25 for ages 6 to 10, 5 and under free. Weather depend-
ing, the desert or the higher Santa Catalina Mountains are the setting for
the four-and-a-half-hour forays led by Trail Dust Adventures, 1665 S.
Craycroft Rd. (% 520-747-0323; www.traildustadventures.com). The
price is $55 cash, $60 credit card for adults, lower rates for 12 and under.
No tours are run mid-June to early September.
History tours
Arrange for walking tours of the historic El Presidio district by calling
the Arizona Historical Society at % 520-622-0956 ($10 per person, under
12 free; from Nov to mid-April, Thurs and Sat at 10 a.m.). In addition to
the $2 tours of the past, as well as the activities offered in the Historic
Depot complex (see “More cool things to see and do” earlier in this
chapter), the museum also offers $5 tours — related to the growth of
transportation, naturally — of downtown’s Armory Park and Warehouse
districts. Call the museum at % 520-623-2223 for details.
You can get a free map for a self-guided tour of downtown’s historical
districts from the Tucson Museum of Art (see “The top attractions” sec-
tion earlier in this chapter), and a brochure detailing the new Presidio
Trail, a 2-mile loop connecting 23 historic and cultural sites via a
turquoise line, from the Metropolitan Tucson Convention & Visitors
Bureau (see the “Fast Facts: Tucson” section at the end of this chapter).
Space mirror tours
The University of Arizona has some BMOC (Big Mirrors on Campus).
Beneath the east wing of UA’s football stadium, the Steward Observatory
Mirror Laboratory houses some of the largest and lightest mirrors in
the world — ideal for collecting light from faint astronomical objects. The
lab participated in several NASA projects and created the two 8.4-meter
mirrors for Mt. Graham’s Large Binocular Telescope (see Chapter 14).
With 10 days’ advance notice, the university offers free tours of the
mirror lab on Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Contact 
Chapter 13: Tucson 227

% 520-621-1022 or click on the “Tours” tab of the mirror lab Web site,
http://mirrorlab.as.arizona.edu, for current details. Maximum
group size of 15 (no minimum) and participants need to be at least high
school age (photo I.D. required).
Following an Itinerary
When planning your perfect Tucson itinerary, factor in two variables: the
weather and your hotel’s location. Many of Tucson’s attractions are out-
doors and the city is very spread out, so if you visit in summer (or during
one of our brief winter rainy bouts) and stay in an outlying resort, you
may not be able to follow these itineraries as well as, say, someone who
bunks in central Tucson on sunshiny winter days. These sketches are
rough, and directions aren’t set in stone or — in local lingo — petroglyphs.
For details on all the sights and restaurants mentioned in these itiner-
aries, see the relevant sections of this chapter.
One-day itinerary
If you have just a single day in Tucson, start out early and hit the
Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum as soon as it opens. Spend a few hours,
and then drive over to Saguaro National Park West visitor center about
ten minutes away. Look out at the amazing vistas, maybe view the intro-
ductory film, and browse the bookstore; you don’t have time for much
else before you head downtown to the Tucson Museum of Art and
Historic Block. At lunchtime, grab a sandwich or salad at the museum’s
Café a la C’Art (if you have a sweet tooth, order dessert first — they sell
out fast), and then wander through the various galleries and historic
houses. The museum’s gift shop is good, but if you want a larger selec-
tion of things Southwestern, head for the 1850s Old Town Artisans com-
plex, just across the street. You aren’t far from I-10. Drive a few exits east
to I-19 and zip down to the Mission San Xavier del Bac. When you get
your fill of all the wonderful religious folk art, walk across the courtyard
to San Xavier Plaza, where you can (again) satisfy your more material
urges with Native American arts and crafts (check out the friendship
bowls made by the Tohono O’odham people). I’m not going to tell you to
resist the Indian fry bread (I hardly ever can myself), but unless you
share, you’ll ruin your appetite for dinner (book a table at a restaurant
near your hotel). If you’re revived by food, go for some Country and
Western sounds — and maybe dancing — at the Maverick: King of Clubs.
Two-day itinerary
On day one, take a more kicked-back approach to the morning part of
the one-day itinerary: You still want to arrive early at the Arizona-Sonora
Desert Museum to avoid taking your first Tucson hike in its large park-
ing lot. When you get there, spend a little more time hanging out with the
snakes and the hummingbirds (no, they’re not in the same enclosure). If
you’re visiting in high season, have lunch in the Ocotillo Café; if not, or if
Part III: Exploring the Big Cities 
228

you’re traveling with kids, the Ironwood Cafeteria is fine for a midday
meal. Then head over to Saguaro National Park West and get directions
to Signal Hill, where you can take a short hike to some Hohokam petro-
glyphs. Pack lunch in a cooler before you head out in the morning and
you can picnic here. Head back to your hotel and relax by the pool
before dinner — an essential part of the Tucson experience, too. (If
you’re traveling with kids, substitute Old Tucson Studios for Saguaro
National Park West, and expect to spend the entire afternoon there.)
Unless you spend the afternoon at Old Tucson Studios, you should have
energy for a night out at the Maverick after dinner.
On day two, go to the Tucson Museum of Art and Historic Block and
Old Town Artisans in the morning. Afterward, you may want to wander
over to the ornate Spanish-Moorish style Pima County Courthouse (on
Church, between Alameda and Pennington), and then continue south on
Church to Congress and east to Fifth Avenue, where you can get lunch at
the hip Cup Café in the historic Hotel Congress. (If that looks like your
scene, check out the Club Congress schedule and come back at night.)
Alternatively, after looking at the Pima County Courthouse, you can eat
at Café Poca Cosa, my favorite Mexican restaurant (take Church a half
block north to Pennington, then head east 2 blocks). In the afternoon,
drive to the Mission San Xavier del Bac and San Xavier Plaza. Who
knows? You may be able to put in more swim time before dinner.
Three-day itinerary
For the first two days, follow the two-day itinerary. Start your third day
at Sabino Canyon, catching the tram tour up, and taking a nice, easy
walk down. Have lunch in one of the restaurants on Tanque Verde’s
restaurant row — maybe on the terrace of the Dakota Café. Interested in
Western art? Mark Sublette Medicine Man Gallery is within range. In
the afternoon, head over to the University of Arizona Museums, where
you can further your education in photography, history, ethnology, fine
art, astronomy — or any combination thereof. After the museums, you
can browse on nearby Fourth Avenue and then have dinner in one of
the low-key restaurants there, or head for the restaurant strip on
Campbell north of Grant. Don’t worry if you haven’t changed your
clothes from the morning walk through Sabino Canyon (unless you’re
smelly from hiking — in which case go back to your hotel and shower
immediately!). Casual is fine for any of the restaurants around here.
Shopping for Local Treasures
The shopping scene, which runs the gamut from thrift stores to sky’s-
the-limit crafts boutiques, mirrors Tucson’s ethnic and economic diver-
sity. As in most western cities, mall-sprawl is more characteristic than
eastern urban-style retail concentrations, but several good the-
buck-drops-here enclaves do exist.
Chapter 13: Tucson 229

Tucson’s malls tend to be open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through
Saturday, from 11 a.m. or noon to 6 p.m. on Sunday, and with longer
hours around the winter holidays. Many shops in other areas open at 
8 or 9 a.m. and shut their doors at 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday,
while others don’t close until later. You can expect Sunday hours to be
shorter (say, 11 a.m.–5 p.m.) or nonexistent.
Best shopping areas
Much of Tucson’s retail is conducted in the strip malls along Speedway,
Broadway, Grant, and Ina roads (east/west), and Oracle, Campbell, and
Tanque Verde (north/south). Two of the best shopping stops, Tubac and
Nogales, Mexico, lie just south of Tucson along I-19 (see Chapter 15).
Fourth Avenue, between University Avenue and Ninth Street, is really
Tucson’s only shop ’n’ stroll strip, with a few cafes to rev you up and
some good bars to wind you down. Baby boomer alert: You may have
flashbacks on this neo-hippie drag near the University of Arizona, lined
with secondhand clothing stores and bead boutiques, along with some
more upscale Southwestern wear shops and galleries. Roughly bounded
by I-10, Toole Avenue, Fourth Avenue, and 15th Street, the Downtown
Arts District can seem a bit desolate sometimes, but it includes several
funky shops, galleries, and restaurants, as well as two restored theaters.
Those seeking to upgrade their living spaces may browse the Fort Lowell
Furniture District, on Ft. Lowell Road between Tucson and Dodge boule-
vards, lined with stores featuring top-notch furnishings and home acces-
sories, mostly in the contemporary mode. See also the “Decorator fever:
the other South Park” sidebar later in this section.
Getting mall’d
The largest, most diverse shopping complex in town is west central’s
Tucson Mall, 4500 N. Oracle Rd., at Wetmore (% 520-293-7330, ext. 4;
www.tucsonmall.com), with more than 200 stores, including Dillard’s,
JCPenney, Macy’s, and Sears; many tony boutiques; and Arizona Avenue,
specializing in things Southwestern. On the east central side is Tucson
Mall’s smaller and younger sister, Park Place Mall, 5870 E. Broadway
Blvd., at Wilmot (% 520-748-1222; www.parkplacemall.com), a low-slung
Part III: Exploring the Big Cities 
230
Music to downtown’s ears
Opened in 1919 and still in the same family, the Chicago Store, 130 E. Congress St., at
Sixth Avenue (% 520-622-3341; www.chicagomusic-musicland.com), strikes
the right note with nearly every musician who blows through Tucson. Johnny Cash,
ZZ Top’s Billy Gibbons, Jackson Browne, and Chris Isaacs have all dropped in. The
place claims the largest selection of new and used musical instruments and sheet
music in the Southwest.

indoor-outdoor complex anchored by Dillard’s, Macy’s, Sears, and fea-
turing plenty of upscale retailers and a 20-plex cinema; finding parking
isn’t always easy. Tucson’s first enclosed shopping center, El Con, 3601
E. Broadway Blvd., between Alvernon and Country Club, in central
Tucson (% 520-795-9958; www.elconmall.com), has been undergoing a
major revitalization. It’s still fairly low key, with Robinson-May, JCPenney,
Home Depot, and Target as its mainstays and no sit-down restaurants
(unless you count Krispy Kreme) — but stay tuned. With luck, El Con
will do as well as the Foothills Mall, 7401 North La Cholla, at Ina, in the
northwest (% 520-219-0650; www.shopfoothillsmall.com), a once
languishing collection of shops that was resuscitated by the addition of
various high-end outlets (including Off 5th by Saks Fifth Avenue) as well
as a Barnes & Noble Superstore and several good refueling stops. The
latest arrival on the semioutdoor mall scene is La Encantada, 2905 E.
Skyline Dr., at Campbell, in the Foothills (% 520-299-3556; http://
laencantadashoppingcenter.com). Still a work in progress, this com-
plex features posh names like Adrienne Vittadini, Williams-Sonoma, and
Coach, as well as some Tucson originals. Locals flock to several trendy
restaurants and to AJ’s, a gourmet grocery store with lots of takeout/
eat-in options.
Getting (boutique) mall’d
Several of Tucson’s intimate shopping enclaves not only offer a nice 
variety of local boutiques but also boast interesting architecture. The
Spanish Revival–style buildings of Swiss-born Josias Joesler, perhaps
Tucson’s best-known architect, may be seen at Broadway Village, on
the southwest corner of Broadway Boulevard and Country Club Road,
Central, built in 1939 as the city’s first shopping center; Casas Adobes
(www.casasadobesplaza.com), on the southwest corner of the inter-
section of Oracle and Ina roads, Northwest; and, naturally, at Joesler
Village, on the northwest corner of River and Campbell, north Central.
All are home to good restaurants as well as an eclectic variety of art,
craft, and clothing shops. Newer but no less interesting are St. Phillip’s
Plaza (http://stphilipsplaza.com), at the southeast corner of
Campbell and River roads, and Plaza Palomino, on the southeast corner
of Swan at Fort Lowell, (www.plazapalomino.com), both in central
Tucson, and both offering farmers’ markets and entertainment on high-
season weekends.

You won’t want to stuff any cacti in your suitcase, but you can get them shipped by
B&B Cactus Farms, 11550 E. Speedway Blvd., 11⁄2 miles past Houghton Road, on the
east side (% 520-721-4687; www.bandbcactus.com), the town’s top prickly plant
connection. The farm is far out on the eastside, but the drive is beautiful and, if you’re
going to Saguaro National Park East or Colossal Cave, it’s not out of the way.

What to look for and where to find it
As you may have guessed, things Southwest — everything from Western
wear to Native American crafts — should top your Tucson shopping list.
The good news: Although Tucson gets its fair share of tourists, this big
city caters to local pocketbooks — which means you can often get better
deals on Southwest goods here than you can in more high-rent towns
like $cottsdale, $edona, or $anta Fe.
Art
The clarity of light, the beauty of the desert, and, no doubt, the relatively
low cost of living have all made Tucson an artist magnet. If you want to
invest in an as-yet undiscovered Picasso, Tucson may just be the place.
In addition to the galleries in downtown’s arts districts — see the Web
sites of the Tucson Arts District Partnership, www.tucsonartsdistrict.
org, and the Tucson Pima Arts Council, www.tucsonpimaartscouncil.
org, for details on locations, events, and tours — you’ll also find gallery
concentrations at Joesler Village, St. Philip’s Plaza, and Plaza Palamino
(see the “Getting (boutique) mall’d” section earlier in this chapter for all
three); and, especially, at El Cortijo, on the northeast corner of Skyline
Boulevard and Campbell Avenue. ArtLife Arizona, found in the lobbies
of major hotels, resorts, and home decorating stores around town and
online at www.artlifearizona.com, covers the entire city, with an
emphasis on the more established galleries.
Dinnerware, 101 W. Sixth St., at Ninth Avenue, downtown (% 520-792-
4503), veering strongly toward the avant-garde, is a good starting point
for a budding art star search. Also downtown, Etherton, 135 S. Sixth Ave.,
a half block south of Broadway (% 520-624-7370), focuses on photogra-
phy, historic as well as contemporary, although painting has a strong
presence, too. Philabaum Glass Gallery, 4280 N. Campbell, Suite 105, in
St. Philip’s Plaza (% 520-299-1939), and Philabaum Glass Studio, 711 S.
Sixth Ave., just south of downtown (% 520-884-7404), feature the work
of world-renowned glass artist Tom Philabaum and other outstanding
practitioners of the fragile art. Don’t miss these galleries, even if you
can’t afford to buy anything. El Presidio (% 520-299-1414) and Settlers
West (% 520-299-2607), both in El Cortijo, are excellent sources of tradi-
tional Western art. Both Western and Native American art are showcased
at the huge Mark Sublette Medicine Man Gallery, 7000 E. Tanque Verde
Rd., central Tucson (% 520-722-7798; www.medicinemangallery.com),
with its adjacent Conley Museum of the West. The newer but smaller
Foothills location, 2890 E. Skyline Dr., at Campbell Avenue, Suite 190, 
(% 520-299-7798), is the venue for art shows and just hints at the treas-
ures available at the central location.
Clothing
If your tastes tend toward the colorful and flowing, Maya Palace, 6332 E.
Broadway, at Wilmot (% 520-748-0817), and in Plaza Palamino (% 520-
325-6411), should suit you. Del Sol, 435 N. Fourth Ave., at Sixth St.,
Part III: Exploring the Big Cities 
232

University of Arizona (% 520-628-8765), sells similarly attractive, loose-
fitting clothing. (Just a coincidence that many of the styles have elastic
waists and this is a city where large quantities of Mexican food are con-
sumed? I think not.) Sorry, guys, women only for both stores — see the
“Western wear” section later in this chapter for men’s fashions.
Gems and minerals
Tucson’s obsession with underground stuff, which comes to a head at
the huge annual Gem and Mineral Show (see Chapter 3), manifests year
’round at such shops at the DAH Rock Shop, 3401 N. Dodge Blvd., cen-
tral Tucson (% 520-323-0781), a one-stop rock shopping center, where
you can buy everything from semiprecious stones to coprolites (that’s
solidified dinosaur poop). At Enchanted Earthworks, in Plaza Palomino
(% 520-327-7007), the stones and crystals — many of the metaphysical
sort — come already set in jewelry and sculptures.
Native American and Mexican crafts
Tucson is a prime gathering ground for Native American crafts, including
Navajo rugs, Hopi katsinas, Zuni fetishes, and Tohono O’odham baskets,
and for artistic items from neighboring Mexico (see Chapter 19 for expla-
nations of these crafts). Anglo crafters in the Southwest tend to be influ-
enced by both Indian and Mexican designs. Expect to find many inter-
esting interpretations thereof in creative Tucson galleries like Dry Heat
Trading Co., 6541 E. Tanque Verde Rd., central Tucson (% 520-733-
2499), where work by local artists mingles with south-of-the-border
imports. Picante, 2932 E. Broadway, central Tucson (% 520-320-5699),
is chock-a-block with whimsical, colorful items from Mexico. Bahti
Indian Arts, in St. Philip’s Plaza (% 520-577-0290), is a great place to
buy — and find out about — Navajo rugs and other traditional crafts.
Owner Mark Bahti has been a trader for a long time and is the author of
several books on the Southwest. The Kaibab Courtyard Shops, 2837–41
N. Campbell Ave. just north of Glenn in central Tucson (% 520-795-
6905), which have been around since the 1940s, offer a wide-ranging,
high-quality selection of Native American and Mexican crafts. For fine
Native American jewelry, don’t miss Desert Son, 4759 E. Sunrise Dr. at
Swan, in the Foothills (% 520-299-0818).
The two gift shops at Tohono Chul Park (see the “More cool things to
see and do” section earlier in this chapter) sell an outstanding array of
contemporary Mexican and Southwestern crafts at very reasonable
prices (If you’re traveling with kids, I dare you to try to leave without
buying a stuffed javalina or other cool Southwest nature toy.) Sometimes
on the pricier side but of consistently high quality, the shops at Old
Town Artisans, 201 N. Court, at Alameda, in downtown’s El Presidio
Historic District (% 520-623-6024), sells the works of some 100 regional
crafters as well as Latin American imports.
Chapter 13: Tucson 233

Western wear
Rarin’ to dress Western? Take it from the top with Arizona Hatters, 2790
N. Campbell Ave., at Glenn, in central Tucson (% 520-292-1320), with a
huge selection of wrangler headgear, both ready-to-ride and customized.
Corral West, 4525 E. Broadway between Swan and Columbus, also cen-
tral (% 520-322-6001), which first opened its doors in 1945, carries
everything the style-conscious cowboy or girl could want, from tight-
fitting jeans and gaudily embroidered shirts to spur-stud earrings. The
goods at Western Warehouse aren’t quite as exciting, but the selection
is huge; central Tucson stores are located on 3719 N. Oracle Rd., one
block north of Prince (% 520-293-1808); and 6701 E. Broadway Blvd.,
between Wilmot and Kolb (% 520-885-4385). Corral and Western
Warehouse both carry footwear, but if you want the old-fashioned, 
hand-stitched, made-to-measure kind, visit Stewart Custom Boot Co.,
30 W. 28th St., between S. Sixth and Seventh streets, south Tucson 
(% 520-622-2706), which has outfitted everyone from Clint Eastwood 
to Barbra Streisand.
Living It Up after Dark
You probably didn’t come to Tucson to attend the opera, but if you get a
diva urge, you can indulge it here. As for its low places . . . well, Tucson
doesn’t exactly rock after dark, but you can find some decent spots to
hit when the sun sets.
Consult the Arizona Daily Star’s “Caliente” section, published with the
paper on Friday, for arts events (you can find the section on line at
www.azstarnet.com/caliente). The Star also has club listings, but the
free Tucson Weekly (www.tucsonweekly.com), distributed Thursday, is
better in that department.

Decorator fever: The other South Park
South Park Avenue between 12th and 13th streets in South Tucson, known as “The
Lost Barrio,” boasts a row of stores specializing in ethnic home decoration and 
furnishings. At Aquí Está!, 204 S. Park Ave. (% 520-798-3605), you can buy the
Mexican goods ready made or tailor the tile work, fabrics, and woodwork to your
tastes. Rústica, 200 S. Park Ave. (% 520-623-4435), also goes beyond the border for
its vibrantly colored wares. Prices at both stores are probably the best you find
north of Nogales — and you don’t have to bargain here. The turkey tacos at Tooley
Cafe are an excellent cure for shopper’s fatigue.
This area is called the “The Lost Barrio” for a reason: It’s difficult to find, because Park
Avenue runs into the University of Arizona campus if you’re coming from the north.
Bypass the university by taking Broadway Boulevard, and then go south on Park.

Nightlife
Although most major music acts that tour this part of the Southwest
tend to bypass Tucson for Phoenix or Las Vegas, the city sometimes
draws top-notch Country and Western talent to the Tucson Convention
Center (see “The Arts” section later in this section). Tex-Mex-inspired
tejano and Tohono O’odham waila (“chicken scratch”) bands also turn
up in the Old Pueblo, and the annual Tucson International Mariachi
Conference (see Chapter 3) often gets hometown girl Linda Ronstadt up
on stage in April. Everyone from the Temptations to Tanya Tucker per-
forms at the Desert Diamond Casino, 1100 W. Pima Mine Rd., exit #80 of
I-19, about 10 miles south of Tucson (% 886-DDC-WINS or 520-294-7777;
www.desertdiamond.com), run by the Tohono O’odham tribe.
Up-and-coming indie bands regularly mosey down to Tucson, usually
stopping first at Club Congress, 311 E. Congress, at Fifth Avenue, Hotel
Congress (% 520-622-8848; www.hotelcongress.com). The alternative
venue is the Rialto Theatre, 318 E. Congress St., between S. Fourth and
Fifth streets (% 520-740-1000; www.rialtotheatre.com), which also
presents good midrange pop, jazz, Latin, and blues acts, but gets bigger
names (for example, Lucinda Williams and Doug Pettibone doing an
acoustic duo in 2006).
Unlike in many cities, Tucson’s clubs aren’t all age segregated. Sure, col-
lege hangouts exist, but many venues get a surprising intergenerational
mix. Bars close at 2:30 a.m. (last call is usually at 2 a.m.), and covers for
music typically range from nonexistent to about $6.
Bars
Good bars are interspersed around Tucson, but downtown stands out
for its local color, the Foothills for its views.
Brightly-hued ¡Toma!, 311 N. Court Ave., at Franklin (% 520-622-1922),
joined at the hip with El Charro Mexican restaurant (see the “Dining
Out” section), has one of the best margarita lists in town — and one of
the liveliest crowds, too. Artsy downtowners flock to Vaudeville, 110 E.
Congress St., at Scott (% 520-622-3535), for its laid-back atmosphere
and live cabaret. Near the Convention Center, Cushing Street Café and
Bar, 198 W. Cushing St. (% 520-622-7984), has a historic building, as
well as good food, going for it.
Blues, rock, and reggae
Berky’s, 5769 E. Speedway Blvd., between Craycroft and Wilmot, central
Tucson (% 520-296-1981), lays on live R&B, blues, or retro rock nightly.
The large Chianti bottle that lets you know you’ve arrived at Boondocks
Lounge, 3306 N. First Ave., just north of Fort Lowell in central Tucson
(% 520-690-0991), may be fake, but the blues are for real. Chicago Bar,
5954 E. Speedway Blvd., between Craycroft and Wilmot, central Tucson
(% 520-748-8169), has eclectic tastes (er, sounds), but you can expect
Chapter 13: Tucson 235

whatever bands are brought in to rock. French Quarter, 3146 E. Grant
Rd., east of Country Club, also central (% 520-318-4767), provides
N’Awleans-style good times, with rousing rock and blues bands accom-
panied by down-home Cajun cookin’. On the Fourth Avenue entertain-
ment strip near the University of Arizona, Plush, 340 E. Sixth St. (% 520-
798-1298), draws collegiate rockers of the hipster variety. (See also 
the Nimbus Brewing Co. in the “Microbreweries” section later in this
chapter.)
Country & Western
The two major venues to listen to country music in central Tucson are
the Cactus Moon, 5470 E. Broadway Blvd., at Craycroft (% 520-748-0049),
where the crowd gets younger (and hipper) as the night wears on; and
Maverick, 6622 E. Tanque Verde Rd., near Pima (% 520-298-0430), with
live sounds on the weekends. You have to travel a ways north to get to
the Lariat Steakhouse & Saloon, 16666 N. Oracle Rd., Catalina (% 520-
825-9907), but the trip is worth it for the historic venue — this is the
oldest continuously operating country western club in the Tucson area —
and the twangy house band. On Saturday nights, head south to Desert
Diamond (see “Nightlife” earlier in this section) for canned cowboy
sounds at the casino, or, in summer, west to Old Tucson Studios (see
“The top attractions” earlier in this chapter).
Dance
Spice it up with salsa on Friday nights at El Parador Restaurant & Cantina,
2744 E. Broadway Blvd., between Tucson Boulevard and Country Club,
central Tucson (% 520-881-2744). Heart-Five, 61 E. Congress St., down-
town (% 520-903-0911), varies the sounds you can shuffle to, from pro-
gressive and techno-house to hip hop and funk. Club Miami at The Keys,
445 W. Wetmore Rd., at Oracle, northwest Tucson (% 520-888-8084;
www.thekeysnightclub.net), lays on techno and top 40 tracks on
Saturdays. Two of Tucson’s top dance clubs, Ain’t Nobody’s Bizness,
2900 E. Broadway Blvd., at N. Stewart Avenue, central Tucson (% 520-
318-4838), and IBT’s, 616 N. Fourth Ave., near the UA (% 520-882-3053),
cater to gays and nonhomophobes who like to let loose. If you’re a line-
dancing fool, see also the Country and Western clubs in the preceding
section; all have the requisite slippery floors, and all offer lessons.
Jazz
The lounge at the Arizona Inn, 2200 E. Elm St., between Campbell and
Tucson Boulevard (% 520-325-1541), is the genuine item when it comes
to cool piano riffs, and why not — the place dates back almost to the
Jazz Age. Old Pueblo Grille, 60 N. Alvernon, just north of Broadway 
(% 520-326-6000), alternates its Sunday live music between the back-
room and the patio, depending on the weather. Goofy name notwithstand-
ing, Monkey Box, 100 N. Stone Ave. (% 520-623-3500), is a sophisticated
downtown venue, where retro jazz and alternative sounds are accompa-
nied by cocktails and tasty light fare. Acacia, 4340 N. Campbell Ave. in
Part III: Exploring the Big Cities 
236

St. Phillips Plaza, north central (% 520-232-0101), Bluefin, 7053 North
Oracle Rd., northwest (% 520-531-8500), Kingfisher, and McMahon’s
Prime Steakhouse (see the “Dining Out” section for the last two) accom-
pany their food with live jazz, generally on Thursdays, Fridays, or Satur-
days. The Tucson Jazz Society (% 520-903-1265; www.tucsonjazz.
org) has details.
Mariachi and Latin
On weekends, mariachis enliven several Mexican restaurants around town,
most dependably La Fuente, 1749 N. Oracle Rd. (% 520-623-8659), and
La Parilla Suiza, with three locations: 5602 E. Speedway Blvd. (% 520-
747-4838); 4250 W. Ina Rd., (% 520-572-7200); and 2720 N. Oracle Rd. 
(% 520-624-4300). For classical and flamenco guitar, try Casa Vicente,
375 S. Stone Ave., (% 520-884-5253), which also dishes up great tapas
and paella.
Microbreweries
Nimbus Brewing Co., 3850 E. 44th St., at Palo Verde, south Tucson 
(% 520-745-9175), is the hippest place for hops, a funky warehouse 
with terrific home-brews and live music Thursday to Saturday. If you like
Belgian-style white beer, Nimbus is the place (I don’t, but I can vouch for
the pale ale). The shining vats at Thunder Canyon Brewery, Ina and La
Cholla, at the Foothills Mall, northwest (% 520-797-2652), produce some
mean ales and lagers; the place always bustles but especially on prime
movie nights (it’s near the mall multiplex). A collegiate crowd quaffs the
suds at Gentle Ben’s, 865 E. University Blvd. (% 520-624-4177), a Uni-
versity of Arizona staple that wins particular kudos for its IPA and
mellow outdoor deck.
The arts
Seek high culture in Tucson everywhere from the convention center to
the University of Arizona.
Top arts venues
Most of the major companies perform at the Tucson Convention Center
Music Hall, 260 S. Church Ave., at Cushing Street, downtown Tucson 
(% 520-791-4101; www.cityoftucson.org/tcc). Centennial Hall, Uni-
versity of Arizona campus at University Boulevard and Park Avenue 
(% 520-621-3341), hosts most of the hard-to-typecast but always top-
rate UApresents series (see www.uapresents.org for a schedule). 
The 2006 to 2007 season includes Jose Feliciano, Sonny Rollins, Denyce
Graves, the Moscow Festival Ballet, Putamayo, and plenty of other inter-
national talent (now if only the hall’s acoustics were better . . . ). Most
tickets range from $15 to $65. When box offices are closed, you can get
tickets for the more mainstream performances through Ticketmaster
(% 520-321-1000); tickets for UApresents events are also available online.
Chapter 13: Tucson 237

Downtown’s newest old (1930) venue, the Southwest deco Fox Theatre,
17 W. Congress Ave., at Stone Avenue (% 520-624-1515; www.foxtucson
theatre.org), will reopen its doors to the public on New Year’s Eve,
2006. It mainly pays homage to its origins as a movie theater (see “Film”
below) but also hosts a variety of performing arts organizations, as well
as a few UApresents programs.
Classical music
Tuning up successfully since 1929, the Tucson Symphony Orchestra
(% 520-882-8585; www.tucsonsymphony.org) may turn up anywhere
from the Tucson Symphony Center downtown to the Tanque Verde
Guest Ranch; check the Web site for venues. Tickets range from $7 
(student rush) to $42. You can get your aria fix with The Arizona Opera
Company (% 520-293-4336; www.azopera.com) at the Tucson Conven-
tion Center Music Hall from October through March — when it’s not in
Phoenix. Tickets run from $25 to $75.
Dance
Ballet Arizona (% 888-322-5538; www.balletaz.org) hasn’t pliéd its
way down to Tucson in the past couple of seasons — the venues have
been deemed too small or too large — but the Phoenix based troupe
may be back in the future, so check online. For more contemporary
movement, often mixed media, try O-T-O Dance, 121 E. Seventh St. at 
N. Seventh Avenue, downtown (% 520-624-3799; www.orts.org).
Tickets range from $8 to $14.
Film
Indies, shorts, and retro classics are all screened at The Loft, 3233 E.
Speedway Blvd., central Tucson (% 520-795-7777; www.loftcinema.
com), which has been Tucson’s main alternative cinema for decades.
These days it’s getting a run for its money from the Fox Theatre (see
Part III: Exploring the Big Cities 
238
The great (arty) outdoors
Don’t want to be an art shut-in? The Tucson Parks and Recreation Department airs
out an excellent (free!) cultural program most weekends in spring and fall. The Tucson
Pops Orchestra puts in regular appearances at the De Meester Outdoor Performance
Center in Reid Park, Country Club Road and E. 22nd Street, while the Arizona
Symphonic Winds breeze over to Morris K. Udall Park, at Tanque Verde and Sabino
Canyon roads. The spring season ends with a week of Shakespeare under the stars.
Check the newspaper entertainment listings sections for details, or phone 520-
791-4873. The Tucson Jazz Society (% 520-903-1265; www.tucsonjazz.org) often
takes its cool sounds outside, too, most regularly to St. Phillips Plaza, at Campbell
Avenue and River Road.

“Top art venues” earlier in this section), where you may encounter 
anything from a Bollywood week accompanied by an Indian street fair to
a big-screen showing of the Academy Awards. The Fox is also the new
venue for the Puro Mexicano Film Festival (www.tucsonfilmfestival.
org), the first U.S. festival dedicated to Mexican and Mexican-American
films, initiated in 2005 and slated to become an annual November event.
Theater
A class act, Arizona Theatre Company (% 520-622-2823; www.
aztheatreco.org) struts its stuff — everything from adaptations of
Jane Austen and Hank Williams to Shakespeare and avante garde 
playwrights — at downtown’s Temple of Music and Art, 330 S. Scott Ave.,
a few blocks south of Broadway (% 520-622-2823). When you’re not
focused on the stage of the gorgeously restored Spanish Colonial/
Moorish theater, browse the theatrical arts shop and the upstairs art
gallery. Tickets run from $26 to $48. For less traditional — and often less
expensive (generally around $20–$22) — fare, try the Invisible Theatre,
1400 N. First Ave., at Drachman, central Tucson (% 520-882-9721; www.
invisibletheatre.com).
Cheer the heroes and boo the bad guys at the Gaslight Theatre, 7010 E.
Broadway, just west of Kolb (% 520-886-9428; www.gaslighttheatre.
info), equally popular with kids and adults who need to blow off steam.
Ticket prices ($16 for adults; $14 for seniors over 60, students, and mili-
tary; and $6.95 for ages 12 and under) include free popcorn, but pizza,
wine, beer, and soft drinks cost extra.

Newspapers/Magazines
The Arizona Daily Star is the morning bringer
of tidings; the Tucson Citizen comes out
Monday through Saturday afternoons (on
Sunday, the ad-stuffed Star is the only game
in town). The Star’s Friday entertainment
supplement, Caliente, has an “Outside” sec-
tion that details hikes and other fresh-air
activities along with arts and nightlife list-
ings. The free, alternative Tucson Weekly,
which turns up in supermarkets, bookstores,
and various publication racks around town
on Thursday, has the best club listings. The
glossy Tucson Guide Quarterly, found on
newsstands and, often, in hotel rooms, has
useful tourist-oriented listings, as well as
articles of local interest (sometimes written
by yours truly).
Pharmacies
Several Walgreens (% 800-925-4733) and
Osco (% 877-932-7948) drugstores operate
24-hour pharmacies and have automated
telephone systems that direct you to the
location nearest to you (have your hotel’s zip
code on hand when you call Osco).
Police
Call % 911 for emergencies; the non-emer-
gency number is % 520-791-4444.
Post Office
Call % 800-275-8777 and select option 6 to
punch in the zip code of the area in which
you’re staying to locate the post office near-
est you. The main post office is at 1501 S.
Cherrybell, near Kino Parkway.
Restrooms
Sorry. You find public restrooms only in
parks and malls. Alternatively, your best bet
is to duck into a hotel or restaurant; I’ve
never been turned down yet when I’ve
asked to use the facilities.
Safety
For a large metropolitan area, Tucson is 
relatively safe. Most of the crime involves
car theft rather than mugging. Be careful 
in large, poorly lit parking lots after dark.
When leaving a movie theater or a mall late
at night, know where your car is and have
your keys ready so you’re not wandering
around, looking clueless. Strolling around
downtown after attending a theater or other
arts performance isn’t a good idea; unfortu-
nately, the streets are usually fairly empty
after dark.
Smoking
Tucson imposed a full ban on restaurant
smoking in 1999, but the confusing laws are
still being contested. In a nutshell, smoking
is allowed in bars and, if a restaurant gets
more than 50 percent of its revenue from
alcohol, it can be classified as one. In addi-
tion, smoking is permitted on restaurant ter-
races, if they’re far enough from the
restaurant’s interior.
Taxes
The sales tax in Tucson is 7.65 percent;
hotels add 11.5 percent to your tab, plus $1
per room per night. The car-rental excises
Part III: Exploring the Big Cities 
240

are 12.6 percent if you pick up your car in
the city. If you get it from a counter in the
airport — as most people do — the tax is
10.6 percent plus an 11.1 percent conces-
sion fee, for a whopping total of 21.7 per-
cent. An additional $7 per car rental at the
airport, $3.50 in the city, goes to finance
Cactus League baseball — whether you’re a
fan or not.
Taxis
A few of the more reliable cab companies
include Allstate (% 520-798-1111) and
Orange Cab (% 520-624-4747). The drivers
of Fiesta Taxi (% 520-622-7777) speak both
English and Spanish.
Time Zone
Tucson is in the Mountain Time zone. Most
of the state — except for the Navajo
Reservation, in the north — doesn’t

Going Beyond Tucson: 
Two Day Trips
In This Chapter
 Checking out the cacti in Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument
 Getting celestial at Kitt Peak National Observatory
 Visiting old houses and big houses (prisons, that is)
T
his chapter’s day trips from Tucson take you to some otherworldly
places, from Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, with its array of
strange, multiarmed cacti; to Kitt Peak National Observatory, where
peering at different galaxies is on the nightly agenda; to what may be the
ancient observatory of Casa Grande National Historic Monument. Many
of the attractions in southeastern Arizona — particularly the sights
along I-19 — also make fun side trips. However, that area has so many
activities to offer that I devote an entire chapter to it (see Chapter 15).
Day Trip #1: West to Organ Pipe 
Cactus National Monument
On this trip, reach for the stars — but not for the cacti. This excursion
takes you through some of the most pristine stretches of Arizona desert,
much of it belonging to the Tohono O’odham (pronounced tuh-ho-noh
ah-ah-tem) people. Kitt Peak National Observatory and Organ Pipe
Cactus National Monument are the high points of this trip (Kitt Peak, lit-
erally), but the old mining town of Ajo, near Organ Pipe, has a certain
appeal, too. You can easily visit Kitt Peak and return to Tucson the same
day. In fact, Mission San Xavier del Bac (see Chapter 13) is en route, so
you can tour both (and I highly recommend a stop at the mission). But if
you want to go all the way to Organ Pipe, staying overnight in Ajo is
best. You won’t want to rush through this serene, laid-back part of the
state. Relax and enjoy the scenery.

Chapter 14: Going Beyond Tucson: Two Day Trips 243
Getting there
To reach Kitt Peak, take I-10 to I-19 South, and then get on Highway 86
(Ajo Way) West for 40 miles to Highway 386, where signs lead you to the
12 winding miles up to the observatory. To continue on to Ajo, return to
Highway 86 and keep driving west to the junction of Highway 85 at Why.
From here you can either go north on Highway 85 to Ajo or south on
Highway 85 to Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument.
Seeing the sights
As you head west from an ugly industrial section on Tucson’s south side,
vacant lots, warehouses, and fast-food strips begin to give way to hills
and open desert. You know you’re approaching the eastern border of the
Tohono O’odham reservation when you see a mountain dotted with
white bumps (the observatories). Nearby, you see a striking thumb-
shaped peak, called Baboquiviri (baa-buh-key-vuh-ree), which is sacred
to the Tohono O’odham people. It is from this tribe that the astronomers
lease their 200 lofty acres.
Funded by the National Science Foundation and representing eight major
astronomical institutions, 1 Kitt Peak National Observatory (% 520-
318-8726; www.noao.edu/kpno; admission: $2 donation requested; daily
9 a.m.–3:45 p.m., closed Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year’s Day)
has the world’s greatest concentration of optical telescopes, including
the world’s largest solar telescope. No, you can’t peer through them —
in fact, computers do most of the observing for the scientists. However,
the drive to the top of the 6,882-foot mountain and the low-cost guided
tours (see the following section) make this destination a great place to
visit during the day. In addition, the nighttime dinner and astronomy
program, which must be booked in advance (see the “Dining locally” 
section for this day trip), is really out of this world.
The Kitt Peak gift shop carries books, T-shirts, toys, and a selection of
Tohono O’odham arts and crafts, especially hand-woven baskets. They’re
pricey, but remember, these baskets take a long time to create. (For more
on these baskets, go to Chapter 19.) Bring a picnic; you won’t find food
concessions on the mountain, and the picnic tables offer wonderful
views (Note: In 2006, the picnic area was closed because drought condi-
tions presented a fire hazard; call ahead to make sure it’s reopened.)
Some 10 miles northwest of Why, Ajo owes its growth to copper — as
you can see when you pass the mountains of tailings (rock waste from
mining) on your way in. Strolling the palm-lined Spanish Colonial Revival
town square, laid out in 1917, is pretty much what there is to do after
you visit the small 2 Ajo Historical Society Museum, 160 Mission St.
(% 520-387-7105). You can also drive up to the 3 New Cornelia Mine
lookout, at the end of Indian Village Road, to see the gaping pit that once
produced the town’s wealth. For details on both sites — which are closed
during the summer — stop in at the Ajo Chamber of Commerce, 400

Side Trips from Tucson

Taladro St., just south of the Plaza (% 520-387-7742; www.ajochamber.
com; Mid-Oct through early July Mon–Fri 8:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m., July 4th–
early Oct Mon–Fri 8 a.m.–3:30 p.m.). To find out about the 860,000-acre 
4 Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge, a bighorn sheep preserve
about ten minutes east of Ajo, go to the refuge office, 1611 N. 2nd Ave.
(% 520-387-6483; http://southwest.fws.gov/refuges/arizona/
cabeza.html; Mon–Fri 7:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m.; closed noon–1 p.m.). To
enter the refuge, you need a permit from the office and a high-clearance,
four-wheel-drive vehicle.
Approximately 24 miles south of Why is a sign for the turnoff to 5 Organ
Pipe Cactus National Monument, Route 1 (% 520-387-6849; www.nps.
gov/orpi), where the multiarmed cousins of the saguaro cactus congre-
gate. The organ pipe cactus, which does sort of resemble a pipe organ,
doesn’t grow as high as the saguaro and doesn’t live as long. In fact, you
see more saguaros here than organ pipes (and lusher stands of organ
pipes grow south of the border), but this desert park is beautiful no
matter which species proliferates.
In addition to several hiking trails (the visitor center has details), two
graded dirt drives wind through the park. Only one is open to the public:
the dramatic 21-mile Ajo Mountain loop drive, with its lush vegetation
and backdrop of tall peaks. You may drive the first 5 miles of the flatter
53-mile Puerto Blanco loop, but the rest of the drive is off limits, indefi-
nitely, because of security concerns about the U.S./Mexico border, which
this route abuts.
The park’s visitor center is open daily from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. except on
national holidays from April through December. Admission is $8 per
vehicle.
Only 5 miles from the park exit, the Lukeville, Arizona/Sonoyta, Mexico
border crossing is popular with Arizonans headed to Rocky Point, the
closest Mexican beach. Unlike some other border towns, Sonoyta isn’t
seedy, but not much happens there. If you want to say you visited Mexico
(no passport required), you can browse a few curio shops and sit out-
side at a pleasant patio restaurant. Many people drive down to Lukeville,
buy perfume, cigarettes, or alcohol in the duty-free shop, and perform
the strange ritual of walking across the border and back in order to
retrieve their discount booty (you can buy duty-free goods only if you
leave the country, even if just for a minute).
Taking a tour
Kitt Peak offers three hour-long guided tours, led by docents who are
often amateur astronomers ($2 for adults, $1 children). The 10 a.m. tour
visits the McMath-Pierce solar telescope, the largest telescope of its
kind in the world. The 11:30 a.m. tour visits the (nameless) 2.1-meter 
telescope, a pioneer in photographic astronomy; and the 1:30 p.m. tour
visits the 4-meter Mayall telescope, the second largest telescope in the
Chapter 14: Going Beyond Tucson: Two Day Trips 245

world when it was built and instrumental in discovering dark matter. If
you can’t stay around for all three tours, come early to see the McMath,
which collects data in the daytime. On occasion, the scientists allow visi-
tors to observe them in their activities. Kitt Peak also offers a dinner
program; see the “Dining locally” section for this day trip for details.
Most of the tours of Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument are self-
guided, but from late December through mid-April, the park rangers lead
walks to points of interest. Schedules are posted daily at the visitor
center.
Staying in style
Ajo has several modest motels. I’ve stayed at La Siesta Motel & RV
Resort ($), 2561 N. Hwy. 85 (% 520-387-6569; www.ajolasiesta.com),
which offers a pool, hot tub, and nice, clean rooms. I’ve also spent the
night at the very pleasant Guest House Inn ($$), 700 Guest House Rd.
(% 520-387-6133; www.guesthouseinn.biz), built in 1925 to accommo-
date Phelps Dodge bigwigs. This friendly B&B offers attractive Arizona-
city-themed rooms and generous morning meals.
If you’re astronomically inclined, consider bunking on Kitt Peak. Book
the Advanced Observing Program ($375 per night for one or two
people, plus $60 per person for room and board, double occupancy),
and you can gaze at the stars with your own personal astroguide until
the cows come home (okay, until it gets light), and then flop down in a
dorm room. For details, see www.noao.edu/outreach/nop/advanced/
info.html or phone % 520-318-8728.
Dining locally
The food at Kitt Peak’s nighttime program — a cold box dinner, with a
sandwich, chips, and cookies — is just okay, but you’re there for the
astronomy, not the gastronomy. During the evening, you get lessons on
how to use a planisphere (a flat map of a sphere), find heavenly bodies
with binoculars, and peer through one of three public telescopes, two
16-inchers and a 20-inch one. Programs, which start an hour to 75 min-
utes before sunset (you’ll be told what time to arrive when you make a
reservation) and last about three-and-a-half hours, are offered nightly,
except from mid-July through August. They are restricted to 34 partici-
pants and are very popular. To make a reservation, call % 520-318-8726
as far in advance as possible; from November through April, call at least
a month in advance. Costs are $39 for adults and $34 for seniors 62 and
over, students (elementary to college), and military with current I.D.
If you attend Kitt Peak’s dinner program, not only do you drive down a
winding, mountain road at night but, for the first three-quarters of a mile
or so, you are allowed to use only parking lights (so as not to interfere
with the telescopes). Still, you follow a guide car so you aren’t com-
pletely in the dark, and the road is wide and fully paved.

Chapter 14: Going Beyond Tucson: Two Day Trips 247
If you visit Kitt Peak in the daytime, you can buy picnic fixings at Basha’s
supermarket, Topawa Road (signs on Hwy 86 direct you here; % 520-383-
2800), in the main shopping center of Sells, the Tohono O’odham reser-
vation’s tribal capital.
Ajo isn’t fine-dining terrain, but several casual options are available. My
two top picks in town are both Mexican (hey, why not take advantage of
being this close to the border?). I can personally recommend the combi-
nation plates dished up at Señor Sancho ($), 663 N. 2nd Ave. (% 520-
387-6226). Locals also pile into Marcela’s Café ($), 1117 W. Dorsey St., at
2nd Avenue (% 520-387-4139), which dishes out a good chicken mole.
Both offer a small selection of typical American fare, too.
Day Trip #2: Casa Grande and Florence
This foray north from Tucson takes you to southern Arizona’s most
interesting archaeological site and to a town that time — but not the
Stargazing in southern Arizona
Southern Arizona is heaven for anyone with even the slightest interest in astronomy.
In addition to Kitt Peak (detailed in the “Day Trip #1: West to Organ Pipe Cactus
National Monument” section at the beginning of this chapter), star geeks also find
bliss at the University of Arizona’s Flandrau Science Center and Steward Observatory
Mirror Laboratory (see Chapter 13), the Fred Whipple Observatory on Mt. Hopkins and
the Astronomers Inn (see Chapter 15), and UA’s astronomy camps (see Chapter 9).
But there’s more. If you’re a dedicated astro-tourist, also visit 6 Mt. Graham
International Observatory, perched on a 10,477-foot peak some 75 miles northeast 
of Tucson. The observatory hosts some of the world’s newest and most advanced 
telescopes, including the Large Binocular Telescope, a joint project of observatories
in Italy, Germany, and the United States. Most Saturdays from early May to mid-
November (when snow is unlikely to close the roads), the observatory runs daylong
tours (9:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m.). The $40 price includes a sack lunch and admission to 
the fun, interactive science center at Discovery Park (% 928-428-6260; www.
discoverypark.com), which is also the departure point for the tours. You can listen
to noises from outer space, watch lightning strike Earth, or (for an extra charge) take
a virtual tour of the solar system on a high-tech flight simulator. But the biggest draw
is one of the most low-tech: gazing at the night sky through a 20-inch reflecting tele-
scope. Attendance on the Mt. Graham tours is limited to 15, and you need to reserve
in advance. Get information about other area activities from the Graham County
Chamber of Commerce, 1111 West Thatcher Blvd. (Highway 70), Safford (% 888-
837-1841; www.graham-chamber.com), or find out more about Mount Graham
International Observatory’s out-of-this-world scientific projects at the Web site
http://mgpc3.as.arizona.edu.

state prison system — forgot. You can return from this day trip via the
scenic or the shopping route.
Getting there
To reach Casa Grande Ruins National Monument, about an hour from
Tucson, take I-10 north to the Coolidge exits and head east on Highway
87/287; signs will direct you to the ruins. After exploring Casa Grande,
continue 9 miles east to Florence on Highway 287. If you want to take the
same basic return route but stop off to shop, go back to I-10 and head
about 10 miles south to Exit 198 and the Outlets at Casa Grande. For a
longer but more scenic return, with large stretches of lush desert, head
south on Highway 79 from Florence. At the town of Oracle, it turns into
Highway 77 or Oracle Road — one of Tucson’s main streets on the west
side. Of course you can also reverse the route, taking the scenic route
north to Florence, and zipping home on I-10 after visiting Casa Grande.
Taking a tour
From January through April, rangers give 30-minute guided tours of the
Casa Grande Ruins at regular intervals during the day. In Florence, a
tour of some of the town’s 139 buildings listed on the National Register
of Historic Places is offered only on the first Saturday in February. How-
ever, you can pick up a map from the Florence Chamber of Commerce,
291 N. Bailey St. (% 800-437-9433 or 520-868-9433; www.florenceaz.
org; Oct–Apr Mon–Fri 9 a.m.–4 p.m., Sat 9 a.m.–2 p.m., May–Sept Mon–Fri
10 a.m.–4 p.m., Sat 9 a.m.–2 p.m.), and tour the homes on your own.
Seeing the sights
Although 7 Casa Grande Ruins National Monument, 1100 Ruins Dr.,
Coolidge (% 520-723-3172; www.nps.gov/cagr; admission: $5 adults,
free ages 15 and under; daily 8 a.m.–5 p.m.; closed Christmas), became
the nation’s first prehistoric cultural site in 1892, the monument still
remains somewhat of a mystery. Archaeologists are fairly certain that the
four-story big house, or casa grande — named by the Spanish missionar-
ies who stumbled across it in the late 17th century — was built by the
Hohokam people in the 13th or 14th century, but no one is exactly sure
why. Some signs, for example, seem to indicate astronomical practices —
walls that face the compass points, openings that align with heavenly
bodies at certain positions along their courses — but no real evidence
proves that the structure was an observatory. The ruins of the 25 ovens
found near one of the site’s ball courts are equally elusive of definitive
explanation. Archaeologists believe the Hohokam people used them to
cook ceremonial mescal roots.
The nearby town of Florence, founded in 1866, is home to another big
house: the state prison. Moved here from Yuma in 1909, the prison is
still the site of all of Arizona’s executions. You won’t see signs of this
grisly legacy while strolling the town’s main street, a throwback to the

Chapter 14: Going Beyond Tucson: Two Day Trips 249
1950s that’s currently being restored, but the 8 Pinal County Historical
Society Museum, 715 S. Main St. (% 520-868-4382; admission by dona-
tion; Sept to mid-July Tues–Sat 11 a.m.–4 p.m., Sun noon–4 p.m.), has a
collection of capital-punishment paraphernalia, including hangman’s
nooses and the chairs on which the condemned sat in the gas chamber.
The 9 McFarland State Historic Park, Main and Ruggles (% 520-868-
5216; admission: $2 adults, ages 13 and under free; Thurs–Mon 8 a.m.–
5 p.m.; closed Christmas), consists of a striking adobe building that
opened as the town’s first courthouse in 1878. Inside are displays of
some scary antique medical instruments (the building served as a hospi-
tal for 50 years), as well as exhibits relating to World War II’s largest POW
camp, located near Florence. The clean-lined courthouse was replaced
in 1891 by the ornate 0 Pinal County Courthouse, at Pinal and 12th
streets, the oldest public building still in daily use in Arizona. The court-
house is impressive, but chronometrically challenged: To save money on
repairs, four clocks, all perpetually reading 11:44, were painted on the
tower.
For shopping, take Exit 198 off I-10 to reach the ! Outlets at Casa Grande,
(% 800-405-5016; www.outletsatcasagrande.com), with more than 
30 stores, including Liz Claiborne, Guess, Reebok, and Samsonite.
If you take the scenic route, 17 miles south of Florence on Highway 79,
between mileposts 115 and 116, you’ll encounter a monument to cowboy
film star Tom Mix, who lost control of his car en route north from
Tucson and was killed in 1940. The roadside memorial, topped by a rid-
erless horse, fronts a pretty rest area with picnic tables.
Dining locally
The Italian-born owners of A&M Pizza ($–$$), 445 W. Hwy. 287 (% 520-
868-0170), just outside Florence on the Casa Grande Ruins approach, dish
out terrific pastas, calzones, and subs, as well as pizzas. For south-of-
the-border flavor, savor the great fish tacos and green-chile burros at
Luis & Bertha’s Inn ($), 695 S. Main St., Florence (% 520-868-9981). The
Francisco Grande Hotel (see the following section) serves good casual
bar fare at Duke’s ($), a Western-style watering hole devoted to the
hotel’s one-time regular guest, John Wayne, as well as good steaks,
pastas, and seafood at the Southwestern-chic Legend’s ($$$).
Spending the night
If you’re interested in baseball history, consider bedding down at the
Francisco Grande Hotel & Golf Resort ($$), 26000 Gila Bend Hwy., 5
miles west of the town of Casa Grande (% 800-237-4238 or 520-836-6444;
www.franciscogrande.com), built in 1961 as a training and relaxation
facility for the San Francisco Giants. A baseball bat–shaped pool and
ball-shaped Jacuzzi are just two of the appealing features of this prop-
erty, which recently underwent an $8 million renovation; a quiet loca-
tion, an 18-hole golf course (where Willie Mays played), a new golf

250 Part III: Exploring the Big Cities 
school, and low room rates are others. In Florence, the standout is
Florence’s Inn at Rancho Sonora ($$), 9198 N. Hwy. 79 (% 800-205-6817
or 520-868-8000; www.ranchosonora.com). Adjacent to an RV park, this
converted 1930s adobe guest ranch is in a walled courtyard with lush
desert landscaping. Casitas with kitchenettes are available, too.

L
adies and gentlemen, start your engines: You’re going on
a major road trip. This part takes you here, there, and
(almost) everywhere in Arizona, from the little cowboy towns
of the south to the great — okay, grand — canyons of the
north. Please, don’t forget to buckle your seat belts.

I
f you’re looking for the Old West of Spanish missions and presidios,
fierce Indian battles, go-for-broke mines, and rough ’n’ tumble boom-
towns, you’ll be hard pressed to find a better stretch of Arizona to
explore than the southeast. All that history sound like a yawn? Don’t
cross this region off your list yet. Nature lovers, wine connoisseurs, folk-
art aficionados — even die-hard duffers — find something to like here.
All in all, the region fits those who prefer the simple pleasures of a
rugged but, in parts, surprisingly green rural region to the glamour and
glitz of the state’s urban centers.
You can cover a lot of this area in day trips from Tucson, but a single 
day doesn’t really give southeast Arizona its due, especially because of
all the terrific places to stay here. A more or less leisurely three days
should be plenty, because this area isn’t nearly as spread out as others
in the state. You can settle in at a local ranch and use it as a base to tour
the region, or hop from one historic hotel or colorful B&B to another as
you travel. The town of Bisbee has the most varied lodging options, but
where you lay your head depends largely on your interests. Stargazers
may seek an aerie in an astronomy-oriented B&B near Benson, while
birders may want to nest near the Patagonia or Ramsey Canyon nature
preserves.
This area’s higher elevation allows you to escape the southern Arizona
desert heat in summer. But summer is also the season when many local
business people go on vacation. Expect to find some restaurants, lodg-
ings, and shops closed, sometimes without advance notice, especially
around Patagonia and Sonoita.

Along the Santa Cruz River
Jesuit missionary Eusebio Kino and, later, conquistador Juan Bautista 
de Anza followed the Santa Cruz River north from Nogales, Mexico, to
Tucson. Today, neither traveler would recognize the developed river-
banks, now roughly paralleled by I-19, but the area is still scenic — when
you venture a little bit from the freeway. In a relatively short span (only
65 miles separates Tucson from Nogales, Mexico), you get a terrific
sweep of Arizona history, from its Mexican roots and earliest settle-
ments to its most recent major industries.
Of all the areas I detail in this chapter, this stretch is the easiest to cover
in a day trip from Tucson. If you’re pressed for time, you can squeeze in
the sights that interest you most, eat in Nogales, and drive back. But if
you spend the night in one of several fine lodgings in the area, you get a
leisurely, more authentic experience (remember, those padres and con-
quistadors traveled on foot or horseback).
Nogales, Arizona, and Nogales, Mexico, are sister towns in two separate
countries. Unless I say otherwise, when I refer to Nogales, I’m talking
about the one in Mexico (with a few exceptions, which are noted, the
U.S. sibling has less tourist appeal).
Getting there
I-19 intersects with I-10 in Tucson. Note: I-19 is one of the few U.S. high-
ways marked in kilometers, but the speed limit — 75 for the most part —
is in miles per hour. This metric/English system mix-it-up gives the illu-
sion that you’re traveling from one place to the next really, really fast.
(By the way, 1 mile equals 1.6 kilometers, so 6.2 miles is 10 kilometers.)
No rail service is available to this area, but Greyhound (% 800-229-
9429) runs buses from Phoenix and Tucson to Nogales, Arizona. Getting
to Nogales, Mexico, from the Greyhound station is a hassle, though. It’s
too far to walk, and buses run from the depot into Mexico only about
once an hour.
Spending the night
If spending the night at a bed and breakfast is your style, be sure to check
out the “Santa Cruz River Valley B&Bs” sidebar in this chapter. A few chain

motels also dot this route, but if you’re not going to hole up in one of 
the more interesting places, you may as well stay in Tucson, where the
pickin’s are better.
Rex Ranch
$$
Near Amado
The journey itself is practically worth the price of a room. To get here, you
drive across the (usually almost dry) Santa Cruz River, winding past trees
that date back to the days when this area was a royal Spanish land grant.
The Rex no longer functions as a guest ranch, but you can still book a
horseback ride. Spa treatments and stress reduction classes are offered,
too, but just lounging around this desert oasis should lower your blood
pressure by several points. The grounds and the old ranch building are
lovely and the rooms — fairly basic, but with such Southwest touches 
as beamed ceilings and tinwork mirrors — are a good value. The meals 
at Cantina Romantica (see “Dining locally” below) live up to the restau-
rant’s name.
131 Amado Montosa Rd. (Exit 48 from I-19, follow signs for the ranch). % 800-
547-2696 or 520-398-2914. Fax: 520-398-8229. www.rexranch.com. Rack rates:

Santa Rita Lodge
$
Madera Canyon
Birders and hikers who want to hole up in the woods love these simple
but comfortable rooms and cabins — both types have kitchens — perched
at an elevation of 4,950 feet in the Coronado National Forest. Perks include
guided bird walks and nature talks in Madera Canyon in spring and
summer, for an extra fee (see the “Exploring along the Santa Cruz River”
section for more on hiking and birding).

counts available Oct–Jan. AE, MC, V.
Tubac Golf Resort
$$
Tubac
You don’t have to be a duffer to want to stay at this golf resort, part of
Arizona’s first Spanish land grant (issued in 1789) and loaded with Old
West charm. Just kick back on the deck of your red-tile-roof hacienda 
or casita — some guest quarters have full kitchens, others separate 
bedrooms — splash around the pool, hit a few tennis balls around, or gaze
out at the Santa Rita Mountains. A megamillion-dollar revamp, begun in
2003 and slated to be completed in 2008, is taking the resort back to the
Part IV: Exploring the Regions 
256

future, capitalizing on the land grant’s history — for example, by having
cattle graze on the golf course — while introducing up-to-date amenities
such as a spa and retail village. The casual-chic Dos Silos restaurant (see
“Dining locally” below) is among the 2006 additions. Rates are still more
reasonable than those at comparable Tucson resorts — and the serenity
here is priceless.

you can’t miss the arched entryway, featured in the film Tin Cup). % 800-848-7893 or

Dining locally
With a few notable exceptions, this isn’t gourmet-dining territory. It is,
however, Mexican-food heaven (see the “Mexican munching on both sides
of the border” sidebar). If you have a down-home American palate —
and an affinity for kitsch — you’ll also be satisfied at the steer-fronted
Cow Palace ($–$$), 28802 S. Nogales Hwy. (Exit 48 off I-19; % 520-398-
2201), with its huge menu of hearty egg dishes, burgers, and steaks.
Right across the road, in the Amado Territory Inn complex (see the
“Santa Cruz Valley B&Bs” sidebar), Kristofer’s Bistro ($$), (% 520-625-
0331), serves good casual food at reasonable prices, upscale name
notwithstanding. With the exception of Cantina Romantica, all the
restaurants in this section are on or near the I-19 frontage road or within
walking distance of recommended sights.
Some clichés are based on fact, and here’s one you should take to heart:
Drinking the water in Mexico isn’t a good idea. In Nogales restaurants,
stick to the bottled stuff (called agua pura), beer, or drinks without ice.
On the streets, go for bottled soft drinks rather than the tempting fresh-
fruit drinks, which are often blended with ice.
Amado Café
$$
Amado
MEDITERRANEAN/SOUTHWESTERN
The Southwest meets the Mediterranean in this cheerful light-wood dining
room, where well-prepared, generously portioned dishes, such as mesquite-
grilled steak and Greek chicken, always taste fresh, and the atmosphere is
as warm as the regions that inspire the multicultural menu. This place
tends to fill up in high season; be sure to book in advance for the weekends.

near Amado
CONTINENTAL/SOUTHWESTERN
This is not your casual drop-in-after-sightseeing spot. You need to make
reservations, then ford a (generally dry) river to get here, possibly in the
dark; but eating at Rex Ranch (see “Spending the night” in the preceding
section) is worth the effort. The rustic-chic patio is lovely, and the food —
created by an escapee from the big city (well, okay, Tucson) — is excel-
lent. You can’t go wrong with any of the perfectly prepared steaks or such
dishes as chicken and shrimp in prickly pear sauce. Many entrees are avail-
able in “petite” portions — a nice option.

Exploring along the Santa Cruz River
Two of the top attractions in this area include the artisan colony of Tubac
and the city of Nogales. Both are magnets for the same activity: producing
Part IV: Exploring the Regions 
258
Santa Cruz River Valley B&Bs
This region has some terrific places to bed down — and to breakfast. If you’re into
bonding with others in the a.m., consider these inns (in order from north to south):
 Mi Gatita ($$), 14085 Avenida Haley Rd. S., about 10 miles southwest of San Xavier
del Bac Mission (% 877-648-6129 or 520-648-6129; www.tucsonbirding
inn.com), offers desert digs with an artist’s touch in a remote setting that’s con-
venient both to the sights along the Santa Cruz River and to Tucson.
 Amado Territory Inn ($$), 3001 E. Frontage Rd. (Exit 48 from I-19), Amado (% 888-
398-8684 or 520-398-8684; www.amado-territory-inn.com), a mid-1990s
reconstruction of a late-1800 ranch house, gives you the best of both worlds: Old
Southwest color and New Southwest plumbing. The inn is part of a landscaped
complex, with interesting shops and eateries, so you don’t feel as close to I-19 as
you actually are.
 Tubac Country Inn ($$), 13 Burruel St. (Exit 34 from I-19), Tubac (% 520-398-3178;
www.tubaccountryinn.com), is a great choice if you want to forgo wheels
for a while. You’re in the heart of historic — and retailing — Tubac, so you can
easily shop till you drop (into your room) and walk to restaurants. The hacienda-
style complex and tree-shaded grounds are very attractive to boot.
 Hacienda Corona de Guavavi ($$–$$$), 348 S. River Rd. (Exit 12 from I-19; call for
directions), Nogales (% 520-287-6503; www.haciendacorona.com), has char-
acter — and acreage — to spare. Both John Wayne and Mexican muralist
Salvador Corona visited the hacienda, and both of them left their marks on this
former headquarters of one of Southern Arizona’s largest cattle ranches (literally,
in the case of Corona). Guest rooms and vistas are equally impressive.

friction on your plastic (skip to the “Shopping for local treasures” sec-
tion, if that’s your thing). Except for golf, this area’s other prime draws
shouldn’t have a negative impact on your wallet.
The top attractions
Asarco Mineral Discovery Center
Sahuarita
Wondering about the oddly defoliated slopes you see on the west side of
I-19 south of Tucson? You can get the dirt (or at least find out how the dirt
is moved around) on a tour operated by the American Smelting and
Refining Company. Take the PR spiels about the importance of mining and
its born-again environmental friendliness for what they’re worth and enjoy
the rare opportunity to see copper mining, one of Arizona’s formative
industries, in action. The tours take about an hour, but you’re likely to

Mexican munching on both 
sides of the border
When you’re in the mood for Mexican food, you have lots of great options in this 
area — although, naturally, you have more choices on the Sonora side of the divide.
My favorites (from north to south) are as follows:
Dos Silos ($$), 1 Otero Rd., in the Tubac Golf Resort (% 520-398-2211), takes classic
Mexican dishes upscale — for example, by adding pork and smoked tomatillo sauce
to a chile relleno — without hiking prices commensurately. The kicked-back patio and
kick-butt margaritas add even more bang for the buck.
Wisdom’s Café ($), 1931 E. Frontage Rd., Tumacácori (% 520-398-2397), owned by
members of the Wisdom family since 1944, has hosted everyone from John Wayne to
Diane Keaton. Specialties include turkey enchiladas and fruit-filled burritos. You can’t
miss this place: Just down the road from the Tumacácori Mission, it’s fronted by two
large white fiberglass chickens.
Elvira ($), Av. Obregón 1, Nogales, Mexico (cross the road after you pass through the
international border and walk 2 blocks west [right]; % 526-312-4773), attracts tourist
by the droves because of its airy patio, its tasty, inexpensive dishes (including an
impressive variety of mole) — and the free shots of tequila that arrive as soon as you
sit down.
La Roca el Balcon ($$), Calle Elias 91, Nogales, Mexico (from the border, cross the
railroad tracks and walk east [left] several blocks; % 526-312-0891), is no great bar-
gain, but it’s worth coming here for the cliffside setting, romantically candlelit at
night, informal during the day. The small but killer margaritas go well with such
dishes as carne tampiqueña (grilled meats served with a chile relleno and enchi-
lada). Tucsonans love this spot, so you won’t be the only one habla-ing Ingles here,
but you’re still off the beaten tourist track.

spend another 20 minutes or so at the gift shop and exhibits in the
Discovery Center, which is also where you buy the tour tickets. Unless you
find the ore-extraction process endlessly fascinating, skip the free half-
hour film.
See map p. 255. 1421 W. Pima Mine Rd. (15 miles south of Tucson; take I-19 Exit 80 
and go west [right] from the exit ramp; you see the copper roof buildings 100 feet
away on the south side of Pima Mine Road). % 520-625-7513. www.mineral
discovery.com. Tours $6 adults, $5 seniors 62 and older, $4 ages 5–12, children
under 5 free; other facilities free. Tues–Sat 9 a.m.–5 p.m.; closed major holidays. Times
and days for tours vary by season (there are usually five per day in high season);
phone ahead for information.
Titan Missile Museum
Sahuarita
Both hawks and doves are fascinated by this museum’s Cold War relic, the
only one of 54 Titan II missiles in the United States — including the 18 that
ringed the city of Tucson — allowed to stay intact under the terms of the
SALT II treaty with the Soviet Union. In fact, this museum offers the only
such exhibition of missiles in the world. Tours, which last an hour, take
you down into the control center where the ground crew lived and pre-
pared, if necessary, to fire a 165-ton rocket that held a nuclear payload 214
times as powerful as the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima. The Arizona
Aerospace Foundation operates this museum, and also runs tours of the
Pima Air & Space Museum (PASM) and the Aerospace Maintenance and
Regeneration Center (AMARC); see Chapter 13 for details on both.

A one-stop shop for Fido
Perhaps your pooch needs a tasty treat or a bathroom break. Maybe you’d like to find
out how to cook nutritiously for your royal dogness. Or perhaps your home could use
a touch of doggie art. Satisfy all your canine needs at The Dog Chefs of America
Kitchen Headquarters and Oh My Dog!, #3 Mercado Bldg., Amado Territory Ranch
(take Exit 48 off I-19; it’s in the complex you see immediately on the east frontage road;
% 520-398-1411; www.dogchefs.com). This combination doggie diner and art
gallery is the domain of Micki Voisard, author of Becoming the Chef Your Dog Thinks
You Are and self-styled “Master Dog Chef of America”; her husband, David Voisard,
creates many of the terrifically whimsical metal sculptures sold at the gallery. A small
dog park in front of the shop is a great place for Fido to frolic or go potty after being
cooped up in your coupe.
You can pick up Voisard’s dog snacks at the shop (open every day except Sun), but if
you want to figure out how to prepare your own, you have to plan ahead. Phone by
the prior Wednesday if you’d like to attend one of the cooking-for-your-dog classes
that Voisard offers every Saturday from 9 to 11 a.m. ($35 per human).

The four men who lived and worked in the cramped mission control area
weren’t claustrophobics (I hope!). If you’re uncomfortable in somewhat
small, enclosed spaces, you may want to pass on this tour. If you experi-
ence mobility problems, on the other hand, the facility can arrange spe-
cial elevator tours; you aren’t expected to tread the 55 steps that are
involved.
See map p. 255. 1580 W. Duval Mine Rd. (about 25 miles south of Tucson; take I-19 Exit
69 west a tenth of a mile past La Cañada to entrance). % 520-625-7736. www.
pimaair.org. Admission $8.50 adults; $7.50 seniors and active military; $5 ages
7–12; free ages 6 and under. Combination Pima Air and Space/Titan Missile muse-
ums $18. Daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m.; closed Thanksgiving and Christmas. Tours depart every
half hour in high season, less frequently in summer; last tour at 4 p.m.; walking shoes
(that is, no heels) required.
Tubac Presidio State Historic Park and Museum
Old Tubac
Little remains of the first European settlement in Arizona or of the presidio
(garrison or fortress) set up to protect it — just a portion of the original
1752 fort and an 1885 schoolhouse. You need to stop at the small museum
adjoining the visitor center to get an idea of this former Spanish colony’s
importance. A tour of the entire complex shouldn’t take you more than an
hour, unless you picnic in the pleasant park.
For more action, come on Sunday from 1 to 4 p.m., October through March,
when living history presentations let you chat with a frontier friar, a señora
preparing tortillas, or soldiers garrisoned at the fort. Kids may be bored
here the rest of the week, but they definitely like this part.
See map p. 255. 1 Burruel St. (take Exit 40 or 34 off I-19 and follow Tubac Road into
the large parking lot at the back of Old Tubac). % 520-398-2252. www.pr.
state.az.us/Parks/parkhtml/tubac.html. Admission $3 adults, $1 chil-
dren 7–13, 6 and under free. Daily 8 a.m.–5 p.m.; closed Christmas.
Tumacácori National Historical Park
Tumacácori
Nearby San Xavier del Bac Mission (see Chapter 13) may be Arizona’s most
impressive Spanish mission, but moody, ruined San Jose de Tumacácori
Chapter 15: Southeast Arizona 261
I left my heart in . . . Tubac?
Juan Bautista de Anza led 240 colonists across the desert from Tubac, an expedition
that resulted in the founding of San Francisco in 1776. In 1859, Arizona’s first newspa-
per was printed in Tubac, and in 1860, the town was reckoned to be the largest in
Arizona.

is my favorite, both for the isolated beauty of its setting and the simplic-
ity of the Franciscan structure. The visitor center/history museum takes
no more than 45 minutes to tour. The timing of the rest of your visit
depends on how contemplative you feel when you stroll around the mis-
sion grounds, including the recreated gardens. On Wednesdays, from
October through March, park ranger–guided van tours (9 a.m.–12:30 p.m.;
$10) explore Calabazas and Guevavi, two other ruined missions in the his-
torical park. Reserve as far in advance as you can; tours fill up fast.
The courtyard of this mission was a stand-in for Tucson in the movie Boys
on the Side. The mission isn’t usually as lively as it was depicted in the film,
but the Christmas festivals are pretty great. (Find more on the festivals in
Chapter 2.)
See map p. 255. 1891 E. Frontage Rd. (take Exit 29 off I-19 south and turn left on the
frontage road; you see the mission in about a mile). % 520-398-2341. www.
nps.gov/tuma. Admission: $3 adults; 16 and under and 62 and older with Golden
Age Pass free. Daily 8 a.m.–5 p.m.; closed Thanksgiving and Christmas.
More cool things to see and do
If you like to hike or ride across the landscape, tee off from it, or even
leave it behind for the stars, this region has more options for you.
 Reach for the stars. Full day (9 a.m.–3 p.m.) tours of the Smithsonian
Institution’s Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory on Mt. Hopkins
are offered for $7 ($2.50 ages 6–12; children under age 6 not permit-
ted) on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from mid-March through
November (weather and attendance permitting). You don’t actually
see any stars (this tour is during the daytime, remember?), but you
find out about the fascinating work done here. Besides, you don’t
get these great mountaintop views at night. Tour sizes are limited,
so call % 520-670-5707 for reservations. The facility’s Web site,
http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/flwo/visitcenter.html, has
details about the tour and displays in the visitors center — worth
visiting even on days when tours are not given (Mon–Fri 8:30am–
4:30pm; closed federal holidays). See map p. 255.
 Tee off. Several golf courses in this area are open to the public. The
championship course at Rio Rico Country Club, 1069 Camino
Carampi (% 520-281-8567), was voted among the top 25 best in
the state and is the site of many qualifying events for USGA and
PGA tournaments (greens fees: $62 high season; $32 low season).
The Spanish-style archways of the Tubac Golf Resort, 1 Otero Rd.,
Tubac (% 520-398-2211), starred with Kevin Costner and Rene
Russo in Tin Cup; in fact, the lake on the 16th hole was created for
the film (greens fees $99 high season; $59 shoulder season; $45 low
season). Look for 9 new holes on the property by 2007 — and for
cows grazing the course. Kino Springs, 187 Kino Springs Dr.,
Nogales, AZ (% 520-287-8701), is on the site of a working cattle
ranch once owned by married film stars Stewart Granger and Jean
Simmons (greens fees: $40 high season; $30 low season). The
Part IV: Exploring the Regions 
262

greens fees in all three cases include a cart but not tax, and apply
to weekend mornings. Rates go down after noon, and during the
week.
 Follow in the footsteps of the conquistadors. The flat 41⁄2-mile
stretch along the Santa Cruz River from Tumacácori to Tubac, pop-
ular with hikers and birders, is part of the Juan Batista de Anza
National Historic Trail. Get a route map from the visitor center of
the Tubac Presidio State Historic Park or Tumacácori National
Historical Park (see the preceding section for both parks). Also
check out the “Horsing around Santa Cruz County” sidebar for
information on the “Saloon-to-Saloon” rides along this trail. See
map p. 255.
 Hit the hiking or birding trail. The Coronado National Forest and
the Santa Rita Mountains meet at the Madera Canyon Recreation
Area, featuring about 200 miles of scenic trails and almost 250 types
of birds. To get there, take Exit 63 off I-19 and go east on White House
Canyon Road for 121⁄2 miles (it turns into Madera Canyon Rd.). Call
the Nogales Ranger District % 520-281-2296 in Nogales, Arizona,
for information. The small, volunteer-run visitor center in Madera
Canyon is only open on weekends. See map p. 255.
 Have some fun horsing around. Rex Ranch and the Amado
Territory Inn in Rio Rico offer equine adventures to horse lovers
and fun seekers in the Santa Cruz River area. See the “Horsing
around Santa Cruz County” sidebar in this chapter.
 Navigate Nogales, Arizona. Those who have an interest in history
and are heading across the border on the weekend should consider
exploring Nogales’ historic district. You can easily spot the clock
tower at the mission-style headquarters of the Pimería Alta
Historical Society, 136 N. Grand Ave., at Crawford Street (Exit 1 off
I-19; % 520-287-4621), devoted to the southern Arizona–northern
Sonora region originally inhabited by the Pima Indians. Exhibits
include fascinating old postcards and a tiny jail. Regular museum
hours are Saturday and Sunday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., though volun-
teers sometimes open the doors on Friday, too. Admission is free.
Three self-guided tours outlined in the Historic Nogales Tours pam-
phlet, put out by the Nogales Main Street Association, are available
at the museum.
Chapter 15: Southeast Arizona 263
That’s one hot tamale
The small, spice-redolent Santa Cruz Chili & Spice Co., 1868 E. Frontage Rd. (just south
of Tumacácori National Monument; % 520-398-2591), is salsa and chile powder cen-
tral. Prices are reasonable, and you can watch the staff members make many of the
products on the premises, as they have been for the past half century.

Shopping for local treasures
Some people — okay, me included — have been known to skip all the
historical sights and just make a beeline for the shops in Tubac and
Nogales. You find some similar goods in both places, especially ceram-
ics. Prices are generally better in Mexico, but the schlep across the
border is more of a hassle. In either place, avert your eyes from all those
great terra-cotta planters and ceramic pots. The cost of shipping them is
prohibitive, especially if you want them to arrive in one piece.
One additional shopping stop is Amado, where the Amado-Territory
Ranch Inn complex hosts a few shops and galleries, including Oh My
Dog! (see the “A one-stop shop for Fido” sidebar earlier in this chapter).
Tubac
Forget hostile Apache Indians. The biggest obstacle to reaching the old
Tubac Presidio these days is getting past scores of friendly shopkeepers.
The town of Tubac is adjacent to the historic park and chock-a-block
with nearly 100 shops and galleries selling arts and crafts, many staffed
by the artisans who created them. No one area is better for shops than
another; excellent quality and schlock know no geographical bound-
aries. Park where you can — things can get pretty crowded on winter
weekends — and just roam around.
Some of my personal favorites include Lee Blackwell Studios, 18 Plaza
Rd. (% 520-398-2268), where the garden-oriented metal sculptures

Bootmaker to the stars
Most folks hoof it directly south to Nogales, Mexico, when they get close to the border;
but for generations, those in the know have made a boot-stop in Nogales, Arizona,
home to Paul Bond Boot Company, 915 W. Paul Bond Dr., off Mariposa Boulevard (%
520-281-0512; www.paulbondboots.com). Clint Eastwood, Frank Sinatra, John
Wayne, and Jane Russell were among Bond’s famous clients. A former rodeo cowboy
who turned 90 in 2005, Bond partnered with younger bootmaker Bob McLean in 2002
to ensure the longevity of the business. Off-the-rack boots start from about $450 while
the custom-made kind — which may include flags, flowers, or other fancy leather lay-
ering and stitching of your choice — can run as high as $8,000.

away, Pancho’s (% 520-398-0003) is a must for anyone looking for
Southwestern home decor items — or inspiration.
Nogales
As soon as you cross the border, you start seeing rows of colorful stalls
and hear vendors calling out to you, “Come take a look, everything’s on
sale today.” If you’re not used to this sort of atmosphere, the sensory
input may be overwhelming. Relax. Don’t stop because you’re being
addressed, just smile and keep walking west (right) with the rest of the
crowd. You soon reach Avenida Obregón, the main shopping street,
where stores with doors line the street and you browse without being
hassled (much). (See the “Nogales shopping tips” sidebar.) Although you
can happily walk back and forth along Obregón, maxing out your credit
card, good shops exist off the beaten path as well. In particular, Calle
Elias (turn east [left] of the tracks rather than right as you cross the
border) is fertile shopping ground.
Driving into Mexico is a hassle. The Customs line for cars is long and
slow, and finding a place — safe or otherwise — to park your car is diffi-
cult. You’re much better off parking on the Arizona side and walking
over. When you get close to the border, you see guarded lots that cost
about $4 or $5 per day. Practically all the good shopping is within easy
strolling distance of the border, anyway.
Serapes and onyx chess sets abound, but you can also find high-quality
crafts from all over Mexico in Nogales. Everything from cactus-stem 
margarita glasses and tinwork mirrors to Spanish Colonial–style wood-
and-iron chandeliers are for sale. For portability’s sake, brightly pat-
terned rugs and wall hangings, tinwork candlesticks, and papier-mâché
fruit are a good bet.
The following shops all offer good selections — but no bargaining.
Tearing yourself away from the endless rooms of new and antique home
furnishings may be tough at El Changarro (Calle Elias 93, just next door
to La Roca restaurant [see “Mexican munching on both sides of the
border” sidebar]). The Lazy Frog (Calle Campillo 57; you see the place

Farmacia facts
Nogales is known for its pharmacies (farmacias). Practically every corner has one,
because Arizonans make regular forays south of the border to buy discounted drugs.
You may not be arrested if you sneak back a tube of Retin-A, but you’re supposed to
have prescriptions for all drugs, including antibiotics, that you buy in Mexico. Don’t
even think about trying to smuggle back pharmaceuticals that are illegal or controlled
(again, unless you have a prescription) in the United States.

before you get to Obregón) is small but has a nice array of crafts from all
over Mexico; for more choices, try the much larger Nueva Maya de
Mexico (Av. Obregón 150). You can find high-quality stained-glass and
wrought-iron creations at Glass Alley Curios (Av. Obregón 182). Telephone
numbers are far more difficult to locate than the shops — but you proba-
bly don’t want the hassle of calling them, anyway.

Nogales shopping tips
Shopping in Nogales, Mexico, is easy enough; however, to get the best prices, keep
a few points in mind:
 You don’t need to change your dollars into pesos. The Nogales merchants are
happy to have greenbacks, and you lose money on the exchange rate if you don’t
end up spending all your Mexican moola.
 You may pay a bit more for the privilege of using plastic. Shopkeepers pass on the
hefty charges they incur from the credit card companies. Cash is a good bar-
gaining tool.
 Know when to haggle. If the store has a door, you may not be able to bargain over
its goods. In a stall, anything goes.
 Know how to haggle. Price tags on an item may or may not be an indicator of a
fixed price. A merchant willing to bargain may offer you a better price if you stand
around looking undecided. Asking, “Is that your final price?” doesn’t hurt. Don’t be
rude if the shop owner says, “Yes.”
When bargaining, start out by offering 50 percent of the vendor’s asking price. You’ve
done well if you end up meeting the seller halfway between the 50 percent you offer
and the original selling price.

Eastern Santa Cruz County
With its fields of high golden grass waving in valleys of oak-dotted moun-
tains, this section of Arizona falls far outside the state’s scenery stereo-
types. (In fact, the area doubled for prairie in the film Oklahoma.)
Eastern Santa Cruz County is nevertheless rich in Arizona history, with
mining and cattle shipping key industries in its past and ranching still
important to its present. The (hoped for) future is a product of the
region’s unusual geography, which spawned a decent crop of wineries.
Aside from a few shops, Sonoita has little to offer; this town is primarily
a place to eat and sleep. However, you may easily spend a morning or
afternoon poking around Patagonia, stopping into funky boutiques, and
just strolling around absorbing the small-town Western flavor. If you
want to tour the area’s wineries, devote at least half a day. Hikers have
plenty of reasons to linger for longer, and if you’re a birder — well, you’re
the best judge of how long you want to hang around the Patagonia-Sonoita
Creek Preserve with other avian haunts, waiting for that Elegant Trogon
to put in an appearance.
Getting there
I-10 east intersects with Highway 83 east of Tucson. Take Highway 83
south to reach Sonoita, which sits at the junction of Highway 82. If you
come from I-19, take Highway 82 east from Nogales, Arizona, to Patagonia.
No rail or bus service is available to this area.
Both towns pretty much consist of main streets that are easy to spot
because highways change into them. In Sonoita, the highway keeps its
name, Highway 82; in Patagonia, the highway becomes Naugle Avenue,
and the street that runs parallel to Naugle is McKeown Avenue. Most of
what happens in Patagonia — which isn’t a whole lot — happens on
Naugle and McKeown between Third and Fourth avenues.
Spending the night
Fans of chain hotels are out of luck here. By staying in this area, you
settle for character rather than consistency. That doesn’t mean giving
up creature comforts by any means, but this area is rural. Even the
places that offer cable TV don’t necessarily get good reception.

In addition to my suggestions, you can find places with only one or two
rooms through the Patagonia Area Business Association (see the “Fast
Facts: Eastern Santa Cruz County” section in this chapter). You may also
consider bedding down at the Tree of Life or Wabi-Sabi Inn, both
detailed in the “Exploring” portion of this section.

Patagonia
Sonoita Creek runs through this 5,000-acre spread in the foothills of the
Santa Rita Mountains, abutting Coronado National Forest. This idyllic set-
ting, along with cheery rooms and friendly service, explains why genera-
tions of guests come back to Arizona’s oldest continuously operating dude
ranch (started in 1926), year after year. No organized programs are offered
for kids, but they ride and eat dinner separately (well supervised) from
the adults — fun for them, even more fun for the grownups.

Dining locally
The good news is that this area has a few surprisingly sophisticated
restaurants, offering dining quality equal to that of the big cities without
big-city prices. The bad news is that eateries tend to come and go — and
the ones that stick around often keep odd hours. Some places don’t open
every night (it’s particularly tough to get fed Sunday through Tuesday
nights), and many stop serving dinner at 8 p.m. In summer, all bets are
off in determining when most of the restaurants decide to operate.

The dining scene also reflects the area’s population mix. Rancher types
get their big meat fixes at the Steak Out ($$–$$$), 3280 Hwy. 82, Sonoita
(% 520-455-5278), while those interested in extreme vegan eating —
we’re talking food that’s not even cooked — dine at the Tree of Life 
Café ($$; see “More cool things to see and do” under “Exploring eastern
Santa Cruz County” later). Santos Mexican Café ($–$$), 328 W. Naugle St.
(% 520-394-2597) is good for down-home Mexican fare, but only serves
breakfast and lunch (closed Mon). The restaurants listed in this section
have more well-rounded menus and (somewhat) longer hours.

AMERICAN
Come to these small, unassuming dining rooms for comfort food — 
especially if you find solace in the likes of pistachio-crusted tilapia, 
beef tenderloin tips with a bleu cheese sauce, or (for lunch) an open-
faced chicken mozzarella melt on sourdough. More traditional mood-
soothers, such as meatloaf with mashed potatoes, are regulars on the ever-
changing chalkboard menu. Sandwiches, salads, and burgers are the
lunchtime staples, but smaller portions of the nightly specials may turn
up, too.

Cozying up to horse country B&Bs
Who says B&Bs have to be frou-frou? These Sonoita-Patagonia-area lodgings fit right
in with the region’s ranching roots (while keeping the comfort level high).
The Dusquesne House ($$), 357 Dusquesne Ave., Patagonia (% 520-394-2732;
TheDusquesneHouse.com), was built as a miner’s boardinghouse at the turn of
the last century. Pluses include separate entrances, a lovely back garden, proximity
to Patagonia’s shops, and cheery, suite-size rooms.
La Hacienda de Sonoita ($$), 34 Swanson Rd., Sonoita (% 520-455-5308;
www.haciendasonoita.com), was built in the 21st century but pays homage to
the 19th with its Old West–themed rooms. Unobstructed mountain views and starry
skies add to the sense of being back in another time.
Spirit Tree Inn ($$), 3 Harshaw Creek Rd., 3 miles from Patagonia (% 520-394-0121 
or 520-401-0541; www.spirittreeinn.com), is ideal for serenity seekers. This
1920s adobe hacienda, a former ranch headquarters, sits on a gorgeous 52-acre
spread abutting a high-desert creek and Coronado National Forest.

NEW AMERICAN/SOUTHWESTERN
The buzz about this restaurant, opened in 2005 in a lovely hacienda-style
house with an outdoor patio, extends all the way to Tucson — no surprise,
since Canela’s young chef worked with some of the best chefs there. The
emphasis on fresh, local ingredients results in such dishes as braised
churro lamb shoulder with housemade pasta and Tohono O’odham
onions, or a cheese plate of local artisanal cheeses. The menu changes
seasonally, but you can expect whatever appears on the menu to be a real
palate pleaser. If the food keeps it local, the wine list tours the world.

Cafe country
You may be in the boonies, but you won’t have to forgo such urban pleasures as good
coffee and its accompaniments in this region. In fact, these are some of the most
pleasant spots in the state to enjoy a light morning or midday meal.
Crossroads Café ($–$$), 3172 Hwy. 83, Sonoita (% 520-455-5189), serves nice break-
fasts, but really shines at lunchtime with its chile- and onion-laden grilled sandwiches
as well as burgers, soups, and salads. Besides coffee, liquid refreshments include
smoothies, chai (tea), and Mexican hot chocolate.
Gathering Grounds ($), 319 McKeown, Patagonia (% 520-394-2097), offers evidence
of this town’s artsy status by serving java made with organic shade-grown beans (it
may be eco-friendly but it still has a kick). The sandwiches, baked goods, and ice
cream concoctions satisfy old-time traditionalists, too.
The Grasslands ($–$$), 3119 S. Hwy. 83 (a half mile south of Highway 82 intersection),
Sonoita (% 520-455-4770), is country pretty, and the food here tastes as good as it
looks. The quiches, pastas, and sandwiches use organic ingredients whenever pos-
sible, and the cinnamon rolls are out of this world.

Exploring eastern Santa Cruz County
I’m almost tempted to say about eastern Santa Cruz County that there is
no there there. Except for Patagonia, this region doesn’t really have a
tourist center; you have to spend much of your time here roaming
about. But considering how scenic the places to roam about are, that’s
nothing to complain about.
The top attraction: Patagonia
A one-time shipping center for cattle and silver, Patagonia has managed
to maintain its Western flavor. I’ve seen ranch hands on horseback trot-
ting alongside traffic on the town’s main drag (which flanks Highway 82).
The town also attracts a variety of artsy types. You’ll enjoy strolling
around, looking at the old railroad depot — now the town hall — and
browsing the crafts stores (see the “Shopping in eastern Santa Cruz
County” section). Or check out these other nearby options.
 Go birding and hiking. The 850-acre Nature Conservancy’s
Patagonia-Sonoita Creek Preserve (% 520-394-2400; http://
nature.org) protects a rare waterside habitat. Watchers have
spotted nearly 300 types of birds here, along with plenty of less
flighty creatures — everything from desert tortoises to deer. To get
there, make a right on Fourth Avenue, which comes to a dead end,
and then make a left. The paved road soon becomes dirt; take the
road three-quarters of a mile to the preserve. Admission is $5 for
nonmembers; free ages 16 and under. It’s open October to March
on Wednesday through Sunday from 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. (an hour
earlier Apr–Sept); closed Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year’s Day.
Guided walks start at 9 a.m. on Saturday mornings (call ahead to
check). See map p. 255.
Three miles east of Patagonia on Harshaw Road, a sign directs you
to the Arizona Trail, part of a proposed 800-mile hiking route tra-
versing the state from north to south. Log on to www.aztrail.org
or phone % 602-252-4794 for details.
 Check more birds off your list — and soak in some history.
The 42,000-acre Las Cienagas National Conservation Area (best
entrance: 7 miles north of Sonoita on the east side of Highway 83,
around mile marker 40; www.az.blm.gov/nca/lascienegas/
lascieneg.htm) is an avian haven; you may get lucky and see a
grey hawk here. No interest in winged things? Come out to see 
the restored 1860s Empire Ranch House (www.empireranch
foundation.org); some rooms are locked but the main entrance
always stays open. For additional information about the conserva-
tion area, and for directions to the ranch house, phone the Tucson
Field Office of the Bureau of Land Management (% 520-258-7200).

If you have a bit more time in Patagonia, you may want to consider one
of the attractions listed in this section. If you’re a horse fan, check out
the “Horsing around Santa Cruz County” sidebar.
 Hit the water. A large reservoir formed by the damming of Sonoita
Creek, and subsequently stocked with fish, is the centerpiece of
Patagonia Lake State Park (% 520-287-6965). Rowboats, paddle-
boats, canoes, and fishing supplies and licenses are available at the
marina store (% 520-287-5545). You can water-ski on the western
part of the lake (daily off season, and weekdays, except major holi-
days, May–Oct) and swim at a sandy beach year-round. This lake
isn’t very tranquil on weekends or in the summertime, but it’s fun.
Entry fee for the park is $7 per vehicle; it’s open 8am to 10pm.
From October through April, more eco-oriented activities are offered
by the personnel at the 5,284-acre Sonoita Creek State Natural
Area (% 520-287-2791), a sub-unit of Patagonia Lake State Park.

Great grapes! Southern Arizona’s 
surprising wineries
Who wudda thunk it? Vinifera grapes seem to like the high-elevation (4,100 feet plus)
valleys in Santa Cruz County. The area has lots of warm, sunny days and lush topsoil
that has been compared to the (pay) dirt in Burgundy, France. Although grape grow-
ing and fermenting in this region date back centuries, scientifically based winemak-
ing is a much more recent phenomenon.
True, Sonoma doesn’t have to start sweating just yet; most of the winemakers in the
area aren’t quite ready for prime time. The exception is Kent Callaghan, whose
Callaghan Vineyards (336 Elgin Rd., Elgin, call for directions, % 520-455-5322;
www.callaghanvineyards.com) produces top-notch bottles (Fri–Sun 11 a.m.–
3 p.m.). But tooling around this beautiful area, stopping and sipping along the way is
still fun. You find some decent wines — or at least good souvenir labels — at reason-
able prices.
In addition to Callaghan, the best bets in the immediate area are Sonoita Vineyards
(3 miles southeast of Elgin on Elgin-Canelo Road; % 520-455-5893; www.sonoita
vineyards.com), whose founder, Dr. Gordon Dutt, reintroduced winemaking to the
area (daily 10 a.m.–4 p.m., except major holidays); and The Village of Elgin Winery (in
Elgin; % 520-455-9309; www.elginwines.com), which occupies a former (1895)
bordello building and sells bottles with names such as Tombstone Red (daily 10 a.m.–
5 p.m.). Definitely not for wine snobs either, Arizona Vineyard, 1830 Patagonia Rd., 
3 miles east of Nogales (% 520-287-7972), is a (vintage) barrel of fun for those look-
ing to sample Road Runner pinot noir in a room filled with old vats, presses, and movie
props. It’s open 10am–6pm daily.

ing areas are being developed, but it should be open by the end of
2006. In the meantime, call ahead for information on the birding
hikes, bat programs, and lake discovery tours via pontoon boat.
Many are free; the pontoon tours cost $3 per person.
Reachable by graded dirt road, the more remote Parker Canyon
Lake, 990 S. Highway 92, 25 miles southeast of Sonoita (% 520-378-
0311), is a peaceful getaway for those willing to haul their own boat-
ing and fishing gear, swim in the clear water, or hike along the shore.
To get to the state park, take Highway 82 7 miles south from
Patagonia, and then make a right at Lake Patagonia Road and drive
4 miles. Ask at the entry booth for directions to the visitor center
for the Sonoita Creek State Natural Area. For locations, see map 
p. 255.
 Heal thyself. The serene landscape around Patagonia makes it a
natural setting for spiritual health and healing centers. The Tree of
Life, 686 Harshaw Rd. (% 520-394-2520, ext. 201; www.treeof
life.nu), has the most comprehensive programs, all with an
emphasis on healthful eating and meditation. Longer stays are
encouraged, but you can just come by for a single day — or a single
meal. Call ahead for reservations and information about the sur-
prisingly tasty vegan “live food” offered at the cafe. Visits and stays
at Wabi-Sabi (% 520-394-0129; www.wabi-sabiinn.com) are less
ascetic, more aesthetic — even indulgent — with everything from
facials and massages to gourmet dinners on offer.

Horsing around Santa Cruz County
What’s ranching country without equines? The Santa Cruz County Fair and Rodeo
Association in Sonoita (% 520-455-5553; www.sonoitafairgrounds.com) hosts
several horsy events, including the Grass Ridge Horse Trials in mid-October, the Santa
Cruz County Horse Races on the last weekend in April/first weekend in May, and 
the Sonoita Quarter Horse show — billed as the oldest quarter horse show in the
nation — during the third weekend of May. In addition, the fairgrounds hosts the
Sonoita Rodeo on Labor Day weekend, and in mid-September, the Santa Cruz County
Fair, featuring a ranch rodeo and a 4-H horse show.
Want to do your own horsey thing? In the Santa Cruz River Valley area, you can mount
a steed at Rex Ranch (% 520-398-2914), or book one through the Amado Territory 
Inn, (% 520-398-2392); see the “Spending the night” portion of the “Along the Santa
Cruz River” section in this chapter for both. Near Patagonia, Coronado Outfitters,
(% 520-394-0187; www.coronadooutfitters.com), has a horse with your name
on it (okay, not literally, unless you’ve got a branding iron). Their options range from $25
for an hour-long ride to $2,400 per person for a 7-night, 8-day pack trip.

Shopping for local treasures
Sonoita has a few good shops on the strip along Highway 82. You’ll find a
nice selection of Native American jewelry at Many Horses Trading Co.,
3266 Hwy. 82 (% 520-455-5545). It’s worth a detour off the main drag to
Buffalo Gals, 3149 S. Hwy. 83, across from the county fairgrounds (% 520-
455-5693), carrying everything a cowgirl wannabe and her pals could want.
But Patagonia is definitely the place for serious retail patrols — just walk
up and down the two main streets, McKeown and Naugle, which flank
Highway 82 between Third and Fourth avenues. My favorite for local
crafts and great imports is Global Arts Gallery, 315 McKeown Ave. 
(% 520-394-0077), where I bought a pair of great horse earrings and 
a Carmen Miranda cookie jar. Mesquite Grove Gallery, 371 McKeown
Ave. (% 520-394-2358), runs a close second for its creative ceramics.
The fruit of other local talent is gathered at Creative Spirit Artists’
Cooperative, 317 McKeown Ave. (% 520-394-2110), which shares space
with Mariposa Books (% 520-394-9186), featuring books by Arizona
writers, and the visitor information center (See “Fast Facts” below). Talk
about one-stop shopping.
Living it up after dark
La Mision de San Miguel, 335 McKeown Ave. (% 520-394-0123), is easily
mistaken for a chapel from the outside; as soon as you enter the wildly
colorful, faux-rustic structure, you know it’s a shrine to live music and
good times (it’s smoke-free too). More in keeping with the region’s tradi-
tions are the Steak Out, 3280 Hwy. 82, Sonoita (% 520-455-5278), where
good Country and Western bands play on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday
nights; and the Wagon Wheel Saloon, 400 W. Naugle Ave. (% 520-394-
2433), a local watering hole that stays open until 1 a.m. on weekends.
Seeking something more uplifting? Patagonia’s small Tin Shed Theater,
304 Naugle Ave. (% 520-394-9369), puts on an eclectic array of plays
and concerts.

Chapter 15: Southeast Arizona 275
Southern Cochise County
The lower portion of Cochise County has the greatest concentration of
attractions in southeastern Arizona, largely of the historical sort but
also of the green variety. This area also has the widest range of places to
stay, and makes a good base for side trips to the rest of the region.
In a time crunch, plan to devote at least half a day to Tombstone and
another half to Bisbee. (Tombstone gets all the press, but Bisbee is equally
interesting and far more scenic.) If you’re not in a rush, spend a full day in
each of these two towns. Military history buffs should allot a few hours to
Fort Huachuca in Sierra Vista, while nature lovers should schedule some
time for Ramsey Canyon and Coronado Monument, both near Sierra Vista.
Getting there
To reach Sierra Vista from Tucson, take I-10 east to Highway 90 and
drive south some 35 miles to the junction with Highway 92 Business
Route (also named Fry Boulevard, and Sierra Vista’s main street).
Tombstone is 28 miles northeast of Sierra Vista via Highway 90 or 24
miles south of Benson via Highway 80. Bisbee is 24 miles south of
Tombstone on Highway 80.
Spending the night
Except for Sierra Vista and, to a lesser degree, Tombstone, this area
doesn’t have many chain hotels, which can make your stay difficult if
you’re traveling with kids. On the other hand, if you’re looking for some-
thing entirely different — everything from a bordello-style B&B to a place
where you can rent a vintage travel trailer — you’ll be very satisfied.
Sierra Vista’s chain hotels include Best Western, Budget Inn, Comfort Inn,
Marriott’s Fairfield Inn, Motel 6, Quality Inn, and Super 8. Tombstone
offers a Best Western and a Holiday Inn Express, both located near the
Boot Hill Graveyard, which is not in the heart of town. See the Appendix
for all toll-free numbers. In addition, the Windemere Hotel & Conference
Center in Sierra Vista (% 800-825-4656 or 520-459-5900; www.windemere
hotel.com) offers chain-style, family-friendly accommodations with
amenities such as a pool and in-room refrigerators. Sierra Vista’s more
distinctive lodgings, in nearby Hereford, are listed below.

My Bisbee picks just skim the surface, while rooms in Tombstone are 
in more limited supply. In both towns, you can check with the local
chambers of commerce if you need more options (see the “Fast Facts:
Southern Cochise County” section later in this chapter for contact 
information).
Canyon Rose Suites
$$
Old Bisbee
These high-ceiling, spacious rooms in a converted historic building are not
only attractive but offer lots of family-friendly conveniences, including
fully-equipped kitchens and TVs with VCRs; a laundry room is on the prem-
ises, too. Other pluses: a location on a quiet street near all the town’s his-
toric sights, shops, and restaurants, as well as reasonable rates.

Casa de San Pedro
$$
Hereford
This B&B is for the birds — and for their human fans, who can hike out
the back door to the nearby San Pedro Riparian Conservation Area. When
you return to your nest, you can check any sightings on the software
installed on the common-room computer. A hacienda-style complex with
colorful Southwest-style rooms, this B&B was custom-designed in the mid-
1990s for travelers who like creatures but also enjoy creature comforts.
The B&B offers birding tours and courses (for an extra fee) on many week-
ends. Other perks: a lap-size pool, a labyrinth, and a butterfly garden.

Copper Queen Hotel
$$
Old Bisbee
Host to the likes of John Wayne and Teddy Roosevelt for decades after
opening in 1902, Bisbee’s only full-service (three-meal restaurant, bar)
hotel isn’t posh enough to be a celebrity magnet anymore, but the hotel is
great for local color. Although the rooms lost some Victorian charm with
the addition of such amenities as private baths, phones, and color TVs,
the public areas are so Old West authentic that you feel as if you should
pull up in a horse-drawn carriage.

Larian Motel
$
Tombstone
Of the several low-key, inexpensive motels in Tombstone’s central historic
district, this one stands out for its cleanliness and spacious rooms, as well
as for its character. Built in 1957, it has such appealing retro touches as a
stylish neon sign and rooms individually named for famous Tombstone fig-
ures like Wyatt Earp and Big Nose Kate. You get all the family-friendly
basics — cable TV, foldout couches — for less than you’d pay at the
chains, and you’re in walking distance of most local attractions.

Ramsey Canyon Inn Bed & Breakfast
$$
Hereford
Hummingbirds, a nature preserve, a historic home with antiques-filled
rooms, and fresh-baked pies: Now that’s a winning lodging combination.
This native-wood-and-stone inn is adjacent to the Nature Conservancy’s
Ramsey Canyon Preserve. Even if you’re not a birder, the hummingbirds
will charm you as they feed outside the window of the breakfast nook. 
B&B guests do some heavy-duty feeding of their own on copious morning
meals — and on the fruit pies that have become a tradition. Three creek-
side housekeeping suites equipped with kitchens may appeal to the more
privacy oriented.

two people in the self-contained suites, which sleep up to four (two of the suites
require a two-night minimum stay; one requires a three-night minimum stay). Inn
rates include full breakfast, suite rates don’t. MC, V.

Stay in the ultimate of ’50s style
You almost expect to see Wally and the Beaver emerging from one of the old trailers
at Shady Dell, 1 Old Douglas Rd. (near the Highway 80 traffic circle; % 520-432-
3567; www.theshadydell.com). If you’re a nostalgia buff who doesn’t mind close
quarters — and a cemetery across the road — the period-furnished 1940s and 1950s
Airstreams and Spartenettes are a kick. Sailor wannabes may also like a 1938 Chris
Craft yacht, among the roster of vintage accommodations. Rates range from $40 to
$85, double occupancy for the trailers, $125 for the boat. The owner also operates the
adjacent Dot’s Diner, equally retro and equally fun.

San Pedro River Inn
$$
Hereford
This inn is the stuff of escapist fantasies: Fishing on the pond of an 
old dairy farm, sitting out on a front porch, just staring at a blue, cloud-
less sky — and barbecuing some burgers to fortify yourself for another
day of doing exactly the same. The four fully equipped cottages on this
lush spread next to the San Pedro Riparian Conservation Area aren’t fancy,
but if you want a laid-back place to bring the kids (and dog and horse),
you’ve found the perfect getaway. One of the proprietors is a birding guide,
and guests are welcomed to accompany him on walks to the San Pedro
River (he also runs van tours of the area for an extra charge).

past Palominas Road to Hereford Road). % and fax: 520-366-5532. www.sanpedro

tages are large enough for four to six people, which lowers the per person rates.
Rates include continental breakfast. For an extra fee, pets are boarded in an outdoor
pen, and horses in corrals. Two-night minimum stay. No credit cards.
Tombstone Boarding House
$–$$
Tombstone
Plenty of character plus a private bath in every antiques-filled room make
these two joined-at-the-hip 1880s adobes my top Tombstone B&B pick. All
the rooms have private entrances, so you have less of a sense that you’re
intruding on someone else’s space. Another perk: Next door’s Lamplight
Room, where breakfast is served, doubles as a Continental and Mexican
restaurant later in the day (see the following “Dining locally” section).
Haunt lovers should inquire about the nonpaying guest who is said to pay
unannounced visits to one of the bedrooms.

Dining locally
Southern Cochise County has good places to sleep, but — with the excep-
tion of Bisbee — not such great eats. And even in Bisbee, full-service
restaurants are rare: Several prime spots are open limited days and hours.
That’s the case with Café Cornucopia ($$), 14 Main St. (% 520-432-
4820), which serves great quiches, smoothies, and other made-from-
scratch fare from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Wednesday through Sunday. In a hip,
converted glass factory, the Bisbee Breakfast Club ($–$$), 75A Erie St.
(% 520-432-5885), includes California omelets and huevos rancheros
among the delectables on offer from Thursday through Monday from 
7 a.m. to 3 p.m. The High Desert Café & Market ($–$$), 203 Tombstone
Canyon (% 520-432-6775), is open every day (until 8 p.m.), but the 
culinary preparation — of imported cheeses, salads, baked goods, and
sandwiches — is geared mainly toward on-the-go diners (though eating
on the premises is an option).
Part IV: Exploring the Regions 
278

Sierra Vista is the best place to get a fast food fix — as well as an Asian
food hit; my favorite in the latter category is the Peacock 80 S. Carmichael
St. (% 520-459-0095), offering authentic, well-priced Vietnamese fare.
The Mesquite Tree, at the corner of South Highway 92 and Carr Canyon
Road (% 520-378-2758), isn’t especially exciting, but it has a cozy
atmosphere and a location convenient to Ramsey Canyon; the seafood is
a safe bet.
In Tombstone, both Vogan’s Alley Bar, 487 E. Allen St., (% 520-457-
3101), and the restaurant in Six Gun City, 509 E. Allen, (% 520-457-
3827), have decent burgers and the like. For higher-end dining, try 
The Lamplight Room, 108 N. Fourth St., (% 520-457-3716), which has
separate Mexican and Continental menus (with the latter only offered 
at dinnertime).
For the most part, if you want dinner after 9 p.m., you’re out of luck.
Arizonans really are early to bed, early to, er, dine.
Chapter 15: Southeast Arizona 279
Bisbee’s colorful B&Bs
It’s tough to choose from among the many colorful B&Bs in Bisbee, but, hey, it’s my
job. Here, then, are my favorites:
The Bisbee Grand ($$), 61 Main St., Old Bisbee (% 800-421-1909 or phone/fax
520-432-5900; www.bisbeegrandhotel.com) is a bit over the top, what with the
high-bordello-style red wallpaper in the halls and eclectic array of rooms. You may
find anything from a stuffed bird to a full-size cutout of John Wayne sleeping with you.
Most guest quarters are on the second floor above a historic saloon, so serenity isn’t
one of this B&B’s strong points.
Calumet & Arizona Guest House ($), 608 Powell St. (% 520-432-4815; www.
calumetaz.com), located in the quiet Bisbee suburb of Warren, was built in 1906
by Henry Trost, one of the West’s famed architects. The grounds and the rooms are as
lovely as the house, and breakfasts are elaborate.
Hotel La More/Bisbee Inn ($–$$), 45 OK St. (% 888-432-5131 or 520-432-5131;
www.bisbeeinn.com), is a good pick for those who aren’t put out when a 1917 hotel
has creaky plumbing. It’s not your typical B&B — among other things, it sits above a
saloon, and accepts “well-behaved” children and pets — but the rooms are Victorian
in style and a full breakfast is included in the rate, so it more or less fits into that lodg-
ing category.
The Schoolhouse Inn ($–$$), 818 Tombstone Canyon Rd. (% 800-537-4333 or phone/fax
520-432-2996), was built, as its name suggests, as a school in 1918. The oak-shaded
grounds are perched above Old Bisbee, and the subject-themed rooms — for exam-
ple, arithmetic and writing — are amusing.

Adobe Southwestern Cuisine
$$
Sierra Vista
MEXICAN/SOUTHWESTERN
Sierra Vista foodies have happily embraced this recent addition to their
chain-dominated dining scene. Those starved for creative cooking revel in
the creativity of the chic Southwestern dishes — pork empanadas with a
trio of chutneys, say, or sugar-spiced salmon with sweet corn polenta —
on the seasonally changing menu. And traditionalists enjoy well-prepared
versions of south-of-the-border classics like tortilla soup and carne asada
(rib eye, grilled Mexican-style). A tastefully rustic Mexican ambience, all
vibrant colors and rough wood, is the icing on the pastel (that’s cake to
you, pardner).

ITALIAN/NEW AMERICAN
Totally out of character for hippie-ish Bisbee when it opened in the mid-
1990s, Cafe Roka proved that Cochise County was ready for a sorbet palate
freshener between courses. An open dining room with exposed brick walls
and the original tinwork ceiling is the retro-chic setting for the food, such
as artichoke and portobello mushroom lasagna, langoustine and blue-crab
cakes, or roasted half duck, served with a small salad, cup of fresh soup —
and the aforementioned sorbet.

Rosa’s Little Italy

Warren
SOUTHERN ITALIAN
A something-for-everyone menu, reasonable prices, and generous portions
of Southern Italian cuisine made from family recipes make this down-home
Italian restaurant well worth the short drive from Old Bisbee — especially
on fine days when you can dine outside on the wisteria-draped patio.

Exploring southern Cochise County
This area offers some of the state’s best tourist stompin’ grounds, with
loads of stuff to do and relatively short driving distances between attrac-
tions. Enjoy, but don’t try to fit too much in. Running from attraction to
attraction only makes you ornery.
The top attractions
Bisbee
More of a success story than Tombstone in many ways, Bisbee is much
less well known, in part because its outlaws were of the corporate sort:
Phelps, Dodge & Co. was the main beneficiary of the multibillion-dollar
copper lode that gave rise to this thriving mountainside town. The last
mining operation didn’t shut down until 1975, and if the price of copper
ever goes up, Bisbee’s mine may reopen. In the meantime, this one-time
hippie enclave is being prospected by an increasing number of tourism-
savvy entrepreneurs.
When you drive into town, take the Old Bisbee exit off Highway 80 and
park your car into the first (legal, I hope) spot you find. West of Main
Street is a large parking lot that fills up fast. From here, you can walk 
to the town’s major attractions — although the town is literally uphill
from here.
Bisbee sits at a mile-high elevation in the Mule Mountains, so you may
find yourself especially short of breath when you walk uphill. If you have
a respiratory problem, you may want to seek assistance getting around.
Stroll around Main Street, with its well-preserved Victorian buildings
and interesting boutiques (see the “Shopping for local treasures” section
later in this chapter). Check out the copper-trimmed Bank of America at
the foot of the street (you don’t have to go in). Other historic attractions
include the Copper Queen hotel (see the “Spending the night” section
earlier in this chapter) and the nearby Muheim Heritage House, 207
Youngblood Hill (% 520-432-7071), an unusual Swiss-built structure
with period furnishings. Heritage House is at the top of Brewery Gulch,
which was once lined with saloons and literally flowed with beer. In addi-
tion, you can find more diversions, above and below ground. For infor-
mation on specific spots to ogle, pick up a copy of the Bisbee Historic
Walking Tours pamphlet at the Bisbee Visitor Center (see the “Fast
Facts: Southern Cochise County” section later in this section).
Chapter 15: Southeast Arizona 281

 Take a journey underground. Actually, the Copper Queen Mine
Tour, 478 N. Dart Rd. (% 520-432-2071), takes you up a 30-degree
grade into the mine’s shaft; you just feel as if you’re descending.
These fascinating inner-earth journeys, which depart daily at 9 a.m.,
10:30 a.m., noon, 2 p.m., and 3:30 p.m., are led by miners who once
worked the Copper Queen. This tour is Bisbee’s most fun attrac-
tion: In addition to everything else, you get to put on a yellow
slicker and a hard hat. If you’re claustrophobic, consider taking the
surface tour around Old Bisbee and to the perimeter of the
Lavender Pit Mine. This tour operates at the same times as the
other tours (except for the 9 a.m. tour). Admission for the mine
tour is $12 adults, $5 ages 4 to 15, children 3 and under free; sur-
face tour $10 all ages, children 3 and under free.
 Mine more of the town’s history. The nation’s first rural museum
to be affiliated with the Smithsonian Institution, the small Bisbee
Mining & Historical Museum, No. 5 Copper Queen Plaza (% 520-
432-7071), gives a great overview of the town’s early years. Be sure
to check out the dazzling gem and mineral exhibit. Admission is 
$5 adults, $4.50 seniors, $2 children 16 and under. It’s open daily 
10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
You can’t miss the Lavender Pit Mine — it’s that huge, multicolored
hole off Highway 80 en route into town from the west. Something
that produced 94 million tons of copper is worth more than a drive-
by. Go beyond town to the intersection of Highways 80 and 92 for
an overlook that has a typewritten history of the mine (hey, they’re
not really formal in Bisbee).
 Tootle around town. Prefer to get your bearings while seated? Every
day except Wednesday in high season and from Friday through
Monday in summer, the Warren Bisbee Railway (% 520-432-7020)
ferries passengers along the route of the electric rail line that
linked Old Bisbee to the wealthy Warren District from 1908 to 1928.
The hour-long historic tour, which departs from the Copper Queen
Plaza, south of the mining museum, at 9:30 a.m., 11 a.m., 1 p.m.,
2:30 p.m., and 4 p.m., is as easy on the attention span as it is on the
feet. Admission is $10 adults, $7 for ages 10 and under.
Fort Huachuca Museums
Sierra Vista
Still an active military base, Fort Huachuca is the last of the famous west-
ern forts to remain operational. Many of the barracks from the 1800s are
currently used as offices, and three have been turned into museums. The
Fort Huachuca Historical Museum is the most interesting of the trio;
among its highlights are the exhibits detailing the role that African-
Americans played in the U.S. military (see the “Buffalo braves” sidebar).
The historical museum’s annex and Army Intelligence Museum are also
worth a visit. Seeing all three museums takes about an hour or so; you
need a little longer to check out the sculptures in the surrounding com-
plex. Other options for activities on the base include a scenic overlook at
Part IV: Exploring the Regions 
282

Reservoir Hill and the hiking trails at Garden Canyon, a magnet for but-
terflies; the Sierra Vista Convention and Visitors Bureau (see the “Fast
Facts: Southern Cochise County” section) can give you details. Note:
because of security restrictions, a driver’s license and proof of insurance
are required for entrance to the fort.
See map p. 255. The main gate to Fort Huachuca is southwest of the intersection 
of Highways 90 and 92 (call ahead for directions). % 520-458-4716 or 520-533-

Ramsey Canyon Preserve
Hereford
You can find out all about the unusual biodiversity of Ramsey Canyon, part
of the Upper San Pedro River ecosystem in Hereford, at the Nature
Conservancy visitor center. Or you can just grab a trail map and stroll
around this remarkably pretty, tranquil preserve. Fourteen species of hum-
mingbirds — more than anywhere else in the United States — stop off here.
When the hummers aren’t flitting around, you still see plenty of other crea-
tures to ooh and aah over. The Miller Peak Wilderness Area in the
Huachuca Mountains is honeycombed with trails, so if you’re a serious
hiker, consider spending all day in this area. The easy 1-mile walk from the
preserve headquarters to a scenic overlook makes a good goal for a couch
potato.
See map p. 255. 27 Ramsey Canyon Rd. (about 6 miles from Sierra Vista; go south on
Highway 92 and take a right on Ramsey Canyon Road). % 520-378-2785. Admission
$3 for members of the Nature Conservancy, $5 nonmembers. Mar–Oct daily 8 a.m.–5
p.m.; Nov–Feb daily 9 a.m.–4 p.m.
Tombstone
Don’t blame Tombstone for being touristy. Hollywood glamorized the
“Town Too Tough to Die” so much that many visitors are disappointed if
they don’t get a little showmanship. Don’t worry; crass commercialism
Chapter 15: Southeast Arizona 283
Buffalo braves
The 9th Cavalry, 10th Cavalry, 24th Infantry, and 25th Infantry — all four of America’s
black regiments — trained at Fort Huachuca. These regiments were given the respect-
ful name Buffalo Soldiers by the Chiricahua Apaches, who were among the groups
the 9th Cavalry was commissioned to fight in 1877. The Fort Huachuca Museum details
the outstanding record of these African-American units. A special section devoted to
the black military experience in the American West includes a rare description of
Estevanico de Dorante, the African-slave-turned-conquistador who took part in the
earliest European exploration of Arizona.

(silver speculating, tourism: what’s the difference?) is an old Tombstone
tradition. Just relax and enjoy the Old West costume dramas.
Besides, plenty of genuine history was made here. The town’s main drag
and most of the town’s attractions are either on or within walking dis-
tance of Allen Street. Tacky tourist shops may line the thoroughfare, but
if you look closely, you can still see bullet holes in some of the buildings.
The available activities are a mix of the truth and a past that has been,
shall we say, embellished:
 Get corralled. Yes, it’s touristy as all get out, but you can’t leave
town without visiting the OK Corral, on Allen Street between Third
and Fourth streets (% 520-457-3456). Tombstone’s most famous
attraction consists of two main sections: the Historama, which
screens a short background film (the fact that the late Vincent
Price narrates it is an, er, dead giveaway of its vintage and histori-
cal subtlety); and the corral where you-know-what occurred.
Among the historical displays in the corral, the best by far is C.S.
Fly’s photo gallery; Fly’s famed photos of Geronimo are worth the
price of admission alone. But, unless Tombstone is really quiet,
don’t try to schedule your day around the overpacked 2 p.m. reen-
actment of the shootout (an additional $2). Admission is $5.50 for
adults, children 5 and under free. It’s open daily 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
(Historama shows run every 30 minutes from 9:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m.).
 Get the lowdown. Only a few places in town give you history that’s
unadulterated by hype. Among the many fascinating displays at the
Tombstone Courthouse State Historic Park, Toughnut and Third
streets (% 520-457-3311), are two diagrammed scenarios of what
actually may have happened at the famous shootout between the
Earps and Clantons at the OK Corral. Make this stop your first if
you want some perspective on the other, more duded-up attrac-
tions. Admission is $4 per adult; children ages 13 and under are
free. Open daily 8 a.m. to 5p.m. except Christmas.
 The Tombstone Western Heritage Museum, 519 E. Fremont St. at
Sixth Street (% 520-457-3800), is chock-a-block with well-displayed
historic treasures — everything from the craps table that originally
sat in the Crystal Palace and a $4 license to practice the business of
“ill fame” to Doc Holliday’s business card and rare editions of the
Tombstone Epitaph. Like the state park, it’s a must-see for Western-
history buffs. Admission is $5 adults, $3 ages 12 to 18, 11 and under
are free (call ahead to check this). Open Monday to Saturday 10 a.m.
to 5 p.m. and Sunday 12:30 to 5 p.m.
 Read some old news. The Tombstone Epitaph Museum, 9 S. Fifth
St. (% 520-457-3456) is small, but so was the newsroom that put
out the paper that created an American legend when it reported on
the gunfight at the OK Corral. Come here to see the original print-
ing presses and read 1880 news reports, including a description of
the surrender of Geronimo. Admission is free. It’s open daily from
9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.

Toughnut and Fourth street (% 520-457-3326), holds the Guinness
World Record for having the largest rose tree in the world (it’s 8,600
sq. ft., give or take a few thorns). The 1880s period rooms also give
a window on a much more genteel Tombstone than the one gener-
ally seen on the silver screen. Admission is $3 for adults, free for
children 14 and under. It’s open daily 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. except on
Christmas and Thanksgiving.
 Witness a shootout. Although the reenactment of the gunfight at
the OK Corral is the best known, it’s not the only showdown in
town. The Six-Gun City Wild West Show (% 520-457-3827), held 
at Fifth and Toughnut streets, uses professional stuntmen for the
shoot ’em ups. Admission is $4 adults, $1 for ages 6 to 12, and 
free for ages 5 and under. Shows are offered throughout the day
Wednesday through Sunday. The Tombstone Mavericks, another
group of professional stuntmen and actors, present the Gunfight at
the Helldorado (% 520-457-9153) in an arena at Fourth and
Toughnut streets. Admission is $4 adults, $3 seniors, and $1 for
ages 6 to 12. Shows are daily at 11:30 a.m., 1 p.m., and 3 p.m. The
shows are pretty similar; go for the Six-Gun City one if you’re
hungry, because decent food is sold on the premises. Note:
Whichever you choose, don’t sit near the front if you’re shy; these
shows are big on audience participation.
 Take to the stage. The horse-drawn stagecoach excursions run by
Old Tombstone Historical Tours, Allen Street (next to Big Nose
Kate’s; % 520-457-3018), are a fun way to pick up some informa-
tion (to be swallowed with a grain of salt). Admission is $10 adults,
$5 ages 4 to 15, and free for ages 3 and under. Tour times are daily 
9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; tours last about 20 minutes.
 See treasures from the Old West. The Bird Cage Theater, Sixth
and Allen streets (% 520-457-3421), looks as if it hasn’t been
dusted since it was abandoned in 1889. Amid the debris, however,
are treasures, such as the gold-trimmed Black Moriah hearse that
transported the losing team at the OK Corral shootout to Boot Hill
cemetery, as well as the velvet-draped “cages” where the ladies of
the night plied their trade above the dance hall and casino. This is
also the site of the longest poker game on record (eight years, five
months, and three days). Admission is $8 adults, $7 seniors, $6
ages 8 to 18, and children under 8 are free. There’s also a $22 family
rate (two adults, all kids ages 8–18). It’s open daily from 8 a.m. to 
6 p.m. except on Christmas.
 Drink in a little history. Although the ornate mahogany bar at the
Crystal Palace, corner of Fifth and Allen streets (% 520-457-3611),
was moved from its original location, it’s still the genuine item. This
place is great for sipping a few beers and, on most weekends, listen-
ing to the live Country and Western sounds of pre-Shania/Dixie
Chicks vintage.
Chapter 15: Southeast Arizona 285

 See where the bodies are buried. You must walk through a huge
souvenir shop to enter the Boot Hill Graveyard, on Highway 80
(just northwest of town; % 520-457-3300), and most of the grave
markers are reproductions. Nonetheless, you can’t leave without
visiting the town’s famed 19th-century bone yard. Get the “Essential
Guide” tour pamphlet for $2 to find out who’s buried where and why
(James Hickey, for example, was “shot in the left temple by Wm.
Clayborne for his over-insistence that they drink together”). Admis-
sion is free. Open Monday to Friday from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and
Saturday to Sunday until 6:30 p.m.
More cool things to see and do
This region offers more interesting ways to take in the local scenery and
culture, in addition to some sunshine (don’t forget the sunscreen!):
 Pretend you’re a conquistador. You can see for miles and miles —
all the way to Mexico — at the Coronado National Memorial, 4101
E. Montezuma Canyon Rd., Hereford (% 520-366-5515, ext. 23;
www.nps.gov/coro), a 4,750-acre preserve dedicated to Spanish
conquistador Francisco Vasquez de Coronado, who passed through
the area in 1540. For the best views, drive the 3-mile dirt road from
the visitor center to Montezuma Pass, and then walk up another
half mile to the top of Coronado Peak (almost 7,000 ft. high). This is
a great place for a family visit. Kids can try on helmets and chain-
link vests similar to those that the conquistadors wore, and explore
a small cave (bring your own flashlight, or buy one at the visitor
center, where you need to get a free permit to visit). And this is one
of the prettiest places in the state to enjoy a picnic. You see a sign
for the memorial 16 miles south of Sierra Vista on Highway 92.
Admission is free. The visitor center, open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
is 5 miles from the turnoff. The grounds are open from dawn to
dusk. See map p. 255.

The truth about Tombstone
Tombstone earned its name after prospector Ed Schieffelin ignored all the people who
warned him that if he ventured into what was then dangerous Apache territory, all he
would find was his tombstone. Instead, in 1877, he struck one of the West’s richest
silver veins.
Tombstone earned its “Town Too Tough to Die” nickname by surviving two major fires,
an earthquake, and the rising of its water table — which caused the silver mine to lit-
erally go under.
In its silver-mining heyday, Tombstone was larger than San Francisco. But the town
wasn’t all bar brawls; Tombstone was also a major cultural center. Enrico Caruso,
Sarah Bernhardt, and Lillian Russell were among the famous entertainers who trod
the boards at the Bird Cage Theatre.

 Listen to cowboy poets. I can’t think of a more interesting way to
spend the day than strolling around Ramsey Canyon in the morning
and seeing a performance at the nearby Arizona Folklore Preserve
in the afternoon. See the “Pick a peck of pickers and poets” sidebar
for details. See map p. 255.
 Take a side trip to Douglas. Bordering Mexico to the east of
Bisbee, Douglas was a ranching center and smelter for many of the
area’s most successful mines. A typical border town now, Douglas
still has a few lures. You may recognize the Gadsden Hotel, 1046 G.
Ave. (on the town’s main street; % 520-364-4481), from the Paul
Newman movie The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean; the stained-
glass window of a Southwest landscape, and a Western saloon
decked with rancher’s brands are highlights.
 Visit the Slaughter Ranch Museum.This National Historic Landmark
in Douglas recreates the area’s ranching heyday in a remote, rural
setting (bring a picnic lunch). Take 15th Street east to Geronimo
Trail and follow the signs; the museum is 20 miles down a dirt road
(% 520-558-2474). Admission is $5 adults; children under 15 are
free. It’s open Wednesday to Sunday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.
 Get wet. With its computer-generated tsunamis, 150-foot indoor-
outdoor tube slide, and a variety of pools for all ages and mobili-
ties, the Sierra Vista Aquatic Center, 2900 M.L. King Jr. Pkwy. 
(% 520-417-4800; www.ci.sierra-vista.az.us/thecove), may
be the splashiest municipal pool complex in the state. It’s a huge
bargain, too, as such things as safety vests, water toys, and lockers
are included in the admission price. Classes galore and entertainment
(such as live bands and dive-in movies) round out the fun in summer.
Admission is $5 ages 18 to 54, $4 ages 55 up, $3 ages 5 to 17; there are
additional fees for nighttime events. Open daily 1:30 to 5:30 p.m.
weekdays, noon to 5:30 p.m. weekends early June through Aug;
open weekends only the rest of the year except Spring Break, Christ-
mas week, Labor Day, and Memorial Day when summer hours apply.
Chapter 15: Southeast Arizona 287
Pick a peck of pickers and poets
Just before you come to Ramsey Canyon, you see a sign for the Arizona Folklore
Preserve, 44 Ramsey Canyon Rd. (% 520-378-6165; www.arizonafolklore.com).
Dolan Ellis, an original member of the 1960s folk group the New Christy Minstrels,
founded this unique performance space, research center, and bookstore. Ellis is also
Arizona’s official state balladeer (bet you didn’t know Arizona had one). Jury-selected
folk artists — from cowboy poets to storytellers, fiddlers, and bluegrass guitarists —
perform each Saturday and Sunday at 2 p.m. in a small space that’s part beatnik cof-
feehouse, part Little House on the Prairie. Phone ahead for reservations; schedules
often shift and tickets ($12) can sell out quickly.

Shopping for local treasures
Most of the shops in Tombstone are on Allen Street, the touristy main
drag. Retail here tends toward the tacky T-shirt and souvenir shot-glass
variety, but Arlene’s Southwest Trading Co., 400 E. Allen St. (% 520-
457-3678), sells good Native American arts and crafts such as kachinas
and pottery. William Brown Holster Co., 302 E. Fremont St., behind the
OK Corral (% 520-457-9208), specializes in hand-tooled reproductions
of 19th-century holsters and also designs belts, saddlebags, and chaps.
For Western antiques, try Silver Lady Antiques, 515 E. Fremont St. 
(% 520-457-3933), adjoining the Tombstone Western Heritage Museum
and owned by its very knowledgeable proprietors
In Bisbee, many of the best shops are on Main Street. Tom Selleck and
Faye Dunaway had themselves custom-fitted for Panama hats at Optimo,
47 Main St. (% 520-432-4544). My favorite of Main Street’s many antiques
shops, the sprawling, two-level Pentimento, 69 Main St (% 520-432-
2752), also carries contemporary local crafts. On any given day, a flaw-
less Czech Art Deco tea set may share floor space with kitschy Frida
Kahlo shrines. Belleza Gallery, 27 Main St. (% 520-432-5877), offers
high-quality painting, sculpture, and furniture, with proceeds benefiting
the Women’s Transition Project (womenstransitionproject.org).

Birding excursions
Birders flock to Southeast Arizona — for good reason. Almost 500 migrating species
use several ecologically diverse “sky islands” for migratory rest stops, and the area
is considered one of this country’s top five bird-watching spots. The best source of
avian information is the Sierra Vista Convention & Visitors Bureau (see the “Fast Facts:
Southern Cochise County” section), which can direct you to the nearby San Pedro
Riparian National Conservation Area and Environmental Operations Park; the Willcox
Playa, near Willcox; and Cave Creek Canyon, near Chiricahua National Monument, as
well as to the various birding sites already mentioned in this chapter. The Sierra Vista
CVB can also supply the Arizona Department of Tourism Southeastern Arizona Birding
Trail map.
Want more guidance? The not-for-profit Southeastern Arizona Bird Observatory,
based in Bisbee (% 520-432-1388; www.sabo.org), is the top birding resource. In
addition to providing a wealth of information about the best times and places for bird-
ers to visit Southern Arizona on its Web site, the organization offers year-round walks
and workshops as well as seasonal hummingbird banding programs. SABO also high-
lights tour operators that offer more extended birding excursions, and occasionally
runs its own overnight trips. Other birding associations in the area include the
Huachuca Audubon Society (http://has.hypermart.net) and Friends of the
San Pedro River (% 520-459-2555; www.sanpedroriver.org), both of which offer
guided walks.

Get strung along at Uptown Tribal, #2 Copper Queen Plaza, Suite 105
(% 520-432-7818), featuring the work of renowned bead maker Kate
Drew Wilkinson and other fine bead artists.
Living it up after dark
If you’re seeking wine flights and other sophisticated sips, better head
back to Tucson. If you like local, often historic, watering holes, however,
you’ll be happy in Tombstone and Bisbee.
In Tombstone, the Crystal Palace (see the “Exploring southern Cochise
County” section of this chapter) gets lots of tourist traffic, but it’s also
where all the town’s fake outlaws and real residents go to wet their whis-
tles. Big Nose Kate’s Saloon, Allen Street, between Fourth and Fifth
streets (% 520-457-3107), which started life as the Grand Hotel in 1881,
gets a similar mix of day-trippers and folks whose livelihoods depend on
re-creating the characters who used to frequent the Grand.
Bisbee’s past is less well known, but its bars are no less notorious:
Brewery Gulch didn’t get its name because the town had an abundance
of tea houses. St. Elmo’s, 36 Brewery Ave. (% 520-432-5578), claims to
be the oldest continuously operating bar in the state, and some of its
patrons seem to have been imbibing here since it opened in 1902. Also
located in historic structures — but attracting a somewhat less rowdy
crowd — are the bar at the Hotel La More, 45 OK St. (% 520-432-5131),
and the saloon at the Bisbee Grand Hotel, 61 Main St. (% 520-432-5900).
Both pour Dave’s Electric Ale, brewed right in Bisbee. Hot Licks Barbecue
& Blues Saloon, 37 OK St. (% 520-432-7200), hosts live music most
weekends and serves up fresh, decent barbecue even when the tunes
are canned.

Northern Cochise County
The Kartchner Caverns State Park, debuted at the end of the last mil-
lennium, continues to change the face of an area that time — and
tourists — forgot. Among other things, chain motels and fast-food
restaurants are cropping up in this region, which spreads south of I-10 to
the east of Tucson. Benson, the town closest to the caverns, probably
hasn’t had this much press since the late 1880s, when three rail lines
crossed here.
Benson may eventually become as convenient a base as Sierra Vista for
forays into southern Cochise County, but at the moment, you won’t find
much reason to spend the night (with one notable exception, which I tell
you about in the “Spending the night” section). Willcox, the other small
town along I-10, has more Old West flavor but offers no good reason to
bed down. Several lodgings outside these two main towns are great for
travelers who want to bond with nature and relax in a remote setting. If
you’re not in this group, you can cover northern Cochise County’s main
attractions in a very full daytrip from Tucson.
Getting there
Benson is 45 miles southeast of Tucson via I-10; continue another 38
miles on the freeway to reach Willcox. Amtrak (% 800-872-7245) runs
trains from Tucson to Benson two times a week. Greyhound (% 800-
231-2222) has twice daily service to both Benson and Willcox from
Tucson, but you need a car to get around either town.
Spending the night
In addition to the lodgings I suggest, Benson has a Days Inn, Holiday
Inn Express, Motel 6, and Super 8. In Willcox, you find links in the Best
Western, Days Inn, Motel 6, and Super 8 chains. (See the Appendix for
toll-free numbers.)
The two towns also offer a few low-key, nonchain motels. Choose your
favorite neon sign and ask to look at a room if you want to take a chance.

Astronomers Inn
$$
Benson
The Astronomers Inn is truly stellar. What other B&B do you know that
has a private observatory and a rent-an-astronomer service? Though the
inn abounds in techno-gismos (like telescopes and an interactive class-
room), rooms are by no means geeky — lovely rural vistas can be seen
from the wraparound porch. With its four themed bedrooms and small
boats that are available to guests, this lakeside guesthouse is great for a
family vacation, whether you’re seeking earthly comforts or have your
head in the clouds.

Cochise Hotel
$
Cochise
History buffs and those hiking the Dragoons enjoy this bare-bones, quirky
lodging in the virtual ghost town (population: about 25) of Cochise. Rooms
don’t have air-conditioning, just ceiling fans, and you won’t find a TV or
pool on the premises; but the place is filled with antiques (which is why
children under 12 aren’t allowed). Allegedly the oldest continuously run
hotel in the state, the Cochise opened in 1882 for workers of the nearby
Southern Pacific Railroad. Another claim to fame: Big Nose Kate, Doc
Holliday’s girlfriend, worked here as a waitress.
5062 North Cochise Stronghold Rd. (call for directions). % 520-384-3156. Rack rates:

Cochise Stronghold — A Nature Canyon Retreat
$$
Pearce
Its eco-conscious construction (straw bale, passive solar energy) and its
spectacular setting in the Dragoon Mountains make this B&B ideal for
nature lovers of all sorts. You can enjoy a vigorous hike in the area, a soak
in the hot tub, or a rest on one of two patios where birds flit by day and
stars sparkle at night. The two lovely Western-flavored rooms with kitch-
enettes are spacious enough for families. The traditional-style teepee on
site provides a Native American–esque experience, with a few of the com-
forts of home.

Grapevine Canyon Ranch
$$–$$$
Pearce
This guest ranch in a Western-purty setting with a working cattle ranch
next door is the real deal. Cowgirl and cowboy wannabes can ride to their
hearts’ content and take part in seasonal round-ups and other ranching
activities. Tenderfoots can choose to hike, swim, or soak in a hot tub. The
cabins are fairly ordinary, the casitas more Southwest chic, and both types
of rooms have kick-back porches or decks along with city slicker ameni-
ties, such as refrigerators, coffeemakers, and hairdryers. Casitas can sleep
up to five people, depending on the unit, while cabins sleep only two
people.

Muleshoe Ranch Cooperative Management Area
How does holing up in a cabin near a natural hot spring in a 49,120-acre nature
preserve in the middle of nowhere sound to you? Clawfoot tubs, Mexican
tile, and wood-burning stoves are among the appealing details of these
Nature Conservancy–run casitas, some of which date back to the late 1800s.
All the units have kitchens or kitchenettes — crucial in this fast-food-barren
wilderness. The land on which these cabins sit is owned and jointly managed
by the Nature Conservancy, the Bureau of Land Management, and
Coronado National Forest.

Dining locally
Northern Cochise County is no gourmet stompin’ grounds; chain restau-
rants and modest cafes are pretty much all the area has to offer when
chow time comes. I’ve driven out of my way for an apple pie from Stout’s
Cider Mill in Willcox (see the “Exploring northern Cochise County” sec-
tion), but I haven’t detoured for any other eats.
If you need to eat in Benson, I like two places on the town’s main drag.
The Old West diner atmosphere makes the Horseshoe Café ($–$$), 154
E. Fourth St. (% 520-586-3303), my favorite Benson chow down spot.
The cafe duded up its menu a bit for tourists, but the green-chile burgers
and fries are as good as ever, and, provided they don’t ever want to
Part IV: Exploring the Regions 
292

change the restaurant’s name, they’ll never take the neon horseshoe off
the ceiling. Ruiz Restaurant ($), 687 W. Fourth St. (% 520-586-2707), is
fine for a down-home Mexican meal in an unpretentious setting.
In Willcox, the Desert Rose Café ($–$$), 706 S Haskell Ave. (% 520-384-
0514), has a surprisingly sophisticated menu, including the likes of
coconut shrimp and beef teriyaki. I can only personally attest to the high
quality of the burgers and steak sandwich, though. Near the Rex Allen
Museum, Rodney’s (a.k.a. “The Spot”) ($–$$), 118 N. Railroad Ave. —
such a hole in the wall that it doesn’t have a phone — serves great bar-
becued pork sandwiches, with daily specials that may include ribs,
shrimp, and catfish plates.
Exploring northern Cochise County
Life existed in northern Cochise County before Kartchner Caverns, but
you’d never know it these days; most of the tourist action seems to have
gone underground. The area’s more remote natural attractions, particu-
larly Chiricahua National Monument, are equally striking — not to men-
tion less pricey — and Willcox hides some Western color behind its I-10
sprawl.
The top attractions
Amerind Foundation Museum
Dragoon
A stark Texas Canyon setting, a lovely Spanish Colonial Revival–style build-
ing, and a wide-ranging collection of American Indian (thus the name) arti-
facts make a visit to this middle-of-nowhere museum in Dragoon a unique
experience. The historical materials contributed by founder William
Fulton, an amateur archaeologist, are complemented by contemporary
work in the same tradition. The museum is small, but allow 45 minutes to
do the collection justice. If pressed for time, you can zip through the nice,
but fairly traditional, Southwest art gallery next door.
See map p. 293. Dragoon Road (1 mile southeast of I-10 off Exit 318). % 520-586-3666.
www.amerind.org. Admission $5 adults, $4 seniors, $3 ages 12–18, ages 11 and
under free. Tues–Sun 10 a.m.–4 p.m. Closed major holidays.
Chiricahua National Monument
Dos Cabezas Route
This natural monument is one of my favorites in Arizona — or anywhere.
The volcanic rock outcroppings impossibly balanced against each other
define the term “rugged western terrain.” The Chiricahua Apaches, who
spent a lot of time trying to keep white settlers out of the area, called this
site the Land of the Standing-Up Rocks. But eroded boulders aren’t the
whole story. A huge variety of plant and animal species, many of which are
Chapter 15: Southeast Arizona 293

more typically found in Mexico’s Sierra Madres, make this area a great
place to hike and bird-watch. A free 8:30 a.m. shuttle goes to a trailhead
where you have a choice of descending via a 41⁄2-mile or 71⁄2-mile route. Call
ahead to check about the ranger-led tours of the Faraway Historic District,
which includes a homestead turned guest ranch; they’re subject to staff
availability. The park has no services. Gas up and stock up on picnic sup-
plies in Willcox.
See map p. 255. Take I-10 to the first Willcox exit and drive through town to Highway
186, where signs will direct you to the visitor center. % 520-824-3560. www.nps.
gov/chir. Admission: $5 per person, ages 16 and under free. Visitor center daily 
8 a.m.–4:30 p.m.; closed Christmas.
Kartchner Caverns State Park
Near Benson
A quarter of a century, secrecy to match the CIA’s (on its good days), and
about as much effort as was devoted to preserving Egypt’s pyramids led
to the public opening of this state park. The fascinating story of how the
caverns were discovered by two Tucson cavers in 1974 is detailed in the
visitor center. Despite the hype, don’t get your expectations up too high if
you’re visiting between mid-April and mid-October, when the Big Room of
Kartchner is closed. The Rotunda-Throne Room sections, open to tours
year ’round, aren’t nearly as large as those in other cave systems and —
call me a cynic — I find the sound-and-light show at the end of the tour
tacky (others tell me the display has moved them to tears). In contrast,
the Big Room, which opened up to the public in late 2003, won’t disap-
point: This part of the caverns hosts many of the system’s strangest and
most colorful rock formations. Unfortunately, the bats like visiting the Big
Room, too; in order not to disturb them, visitors can’t enter during the
months when they’re hanging around here.
The Rotunda-Throne and the Big Room tours last about an hour and a half
each. You may want to spend another half hour or so in the visitor center;
the 20-minute introductory film is definitely worth viewing. And the
grounds are a great place to picnic. Pack a picnic basket (only vending
machines are on the grounds), and plan to spend another leisurely hour
gazing at the surrounding mountains and desert, perhaps taking a short
hike.
As a result of big publicity for relatively small-capacity cave tours,
Kartchner Caverns books up well in advance. If you don’t want to be dis-
appointed, make reservations (yes, I’m shouting at you, but it’s for your
own good). The booking lines are open every day from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
but be prepared to be patient; the line is often busy. The cavern staff sets

Willcox
These days, more trucks than trains stop at Willcox, formerly one of the
country’s major cattle shippers. The town still has some Old West kick
left, however, especially in the Railroad Historic District, where you can
see the restored Southern Pacific Willcox Historical Depot and the Willcox
Commercial, Arizona’s oldest department store. In addition to ducking
into those two Railroad Avenue icons, you have a few other options.
Sunday isn’t a good time to visit. Many of the town’s attractions —
including the depot and the Commercial — take this as a day of rest.
 Improve your knowledge of movie cowboys. The Rex Allen
Arizona Cowboy Museum and Theater, 150 N. Railroad Ave. 
(% 520-384-4583), displays the spangled costumes and other
memorabilia from the many films that Willcox’s favorite son made
in the 1940s and 1950s. The Willcox Cowboy Hall of Fame, in the
museum’s back room, pays tribute to the area’s less melodic ranch-
ers and rodeo stars. Admission is $2 per person, $3 per couple, and
$5 per family (talk about family values!). It’s open daily 10 a.m. to 
4 p.m., except Easter, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year’s Day.
 The ashes of the “last of the silver screen cowboys” were scattered
in Railroad Park, just across from the Rex Allen Museum. And
Allen’s mount, Koko (1940–1967), is buried in this park next to a
bronze statue of his loyal human companion. (Allen thus spared
Koko the fate of his fellow equestrian thespian, Trigger, who was
stuffed and displayed in the Roy Rogers Museum.)
 Buy a big apple pie. Strange, but true: At an elevation of nearly
4,200 feet, Willcox is Arizona’s apple center. And of the many local
places to apple polish your trip, Stout’s Cider Mill (% 520-384-
3696) rules. The mill is across the parking lot from the Chamber of
Commerce (see the “Fast Facts: Northern Cochise County” section
later in this chapter). Don’t try to pretend you’re there for anything
else but the famous pie, with a crust about 5 inches high and — the
baker boasts — more apple-packed than any other.
 Trace the region’s roots. Housed in a 1920s hardware store, the
Chiricahua Regional Museum, 127 E. Maley, off Railroad Avenue
Chapter 15: Southeast Arizona 295

(% 520-384-3971), focuses on the area’s early ranching, railroad-
ing, and mining history. Especially noteworthy are the Apache
Indian artifacts, including some belonging to Geronimo and
Cochise. Admission is by a suggested donation of $2 for singles, $3
for couples, and $5 for a family. It’s open from Monday through
Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., except holidays (theoretically;
actual hours of operation can be sporadic).
More cool things to see and do
From ancient rock art to 19th-century battlegrounds and current Arizona
literature, you can find out about the state’s past and present in this
region.
 Find a hideaway. At Cochise Stronghold (% 520-364-3468;
www.cochisestronghold.com) you see why it took so long for the
U.S. Cavalry to capture Cochise and Geronimo. This natural granite
fortress south of Dragoon is in a remote, rugged rock region that’s
great for hiking. To get here, take Exit 331 from I-10 to Highway 191;
look for the sign for Cochise Stronghold at Ironwood Drive, near
Sunsites. You have to drive nearly 9 miles on a fairly rough dirt
road (Forest Service Rd. 84), which includes five stream crossings
(don’t try this in wet weather). You know you’re there when you
see some picnic tables, campsites, and restrooms. Admission is a
$3 day-use fee per vehicle. See map p. 255.
 Get fortified. You drive down a graded dirt road and trek 11⁄2 miles
to reach Fort Bowie National Historical Site (% 520-847-2500;
www.nps.gov/fobo). Little is left of the 1862 fort or of the Butterfield
Stage Station it guarded, and no evidence remains of the many skir-
mishes between the Chiricahua Apaches and the U.S. Cavalry that
took place here, but markers along the route and a serene setting
render this site a good way to combine a little exercise — the hike’s
easy — with some history. To get here, take any of the I-10 Willcox
exits to Highway 186. Drive 22 miles south; signs point you to the
site. Admission is free. Grounds are open daily from dawn to dusk;
the visitor center and bookstore are open daily from 8 a.m. to 
4:30 p.m., closed Christmas. See map p. 255.

Whoop-de-do, Western style
Rex Allen Days, held the first weekend of October, continue despite the fact that Rex
Allen, Sr., isn’t around any longer to attend the festival that bears his name. (He died
in Tucson in 1999.) For details about these four days of Western-style celebrations,
including everything from turtle races and all-you-can-eat pancake breakfasts to a
rip-roarin’ rodeo, call the Willcox Chamber of Commerce (see the “Fast Facts: Northern
Cochise County” section at the end of this chapter).

 Get bookish. A top-rate selection of books about Arizona plus a
unique ranch setting make the Singing Wind Bookshop, Singing
Wind Road (% 520-586-2425), worth the search. From Tucson, take
I-10 Exit 304, just beyond Benson, and turn left. In about 21⁄4 miles,
you see a red signpost at the bookstore turnoff. Prepare to stop and
open the large green gate. It’s open daily 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

Central Arizona
In This Chapter
 Taking in Sedona and the Verde Valley: Red rocks, good vibes, and ancient
sites
 Exploring Prescott: From Victorian row houses to Whiskey Row
C
entral Arizona has its ups and downs: Like much of the rest of the
state, this region is on a geological roller coaster. Sedona, perched
at 4,400 feet, and Prescott, nearly a mile high, are prime summer retreats
for Phoenicians and out-of-staters alike, who are drawn year-round by
the stunning red-rock vistas and charming Victorian neighborhoods,
respectively.
Although central Arizona encompasses quite a bit more than these two
central towns and their surroundings — specifically, the Colorado River
towns on the state’s “West Coast” and the White Mountains to the east —
the focus here is on places that first-time visitors to the state shouldn’t
miss. For a sketch of the White Mountains or a bit of information on
Arizona’s hard-to-reach western section, see the sidebars entitled “A
region for all seasons” and “No bridge too far,” respectively (later in this
chapter).
The towns in central Arizona are as different in personality as they are in
elevation, but each offers loads of Western color and eye-catching vistas.
With its no-holds-barred scenery and upscale lodging, dining, and shop-
ping, Sedona has the highest profile in this generally low-key region. You
can base yourself here for three or four nights, making trips to the Grand
Canyon, Prescott, and Verde Valley, but you’d better be feeling pretty
flush. Sedona isn’t only the most expensive place to stay in central
Arizona; it ranks with Scottsdale as the priciest in the entire state.
Although much more economical, Prescott is a slightly less central base:
The Grand Canyon is about 40 miles (round-trip) farther from Prescott
than from Sedona.
Prescott and Sedona are fairly close to each other, but the roads between
them aren’t straight. The Highway 89A/89 route from Sedona to Prescott
has long stretches of mountain road switchbacks. Much of the scenery is
spectacular, but if you find this kind of driving as stressful as I do, you
may not be able to enjoy the view.

Sedona and the Verde Valley
John Wayne meets the New Age in Sedona, a much-filmed Western land-
scape where, some people believe, powerful energy centers called vor-
texes enhance your well-being and creativity (in other words, your basic
good vibes). The area definitely attracts artists, and visitors do tend to
take on a mellow attitude, but that may also be because they’re eye-
balling incredible red-rock scenery and downing potent margaritas.
Stretching out below Sedona, the Verde Valley gets far less press; most
people stop by to see the Native American ruins and Jerome, a funky,
far-from-moribund ghost town.
Sedona is an end, not a means, to other places, as its abundance of
rooms, restaurants, and shops attest. But again, Sedona isn’t cheap. Nor
is it especially peaceful: In high season, the town can get annoyingly
crowded with tourists (not you — all those other people). Still, Sedona
has the best places to eat in the region, and I can see why you’d want to
spend as much time in this gorgeous setting as possible.
Getting there
Sedona doesn’t have commercial air service from Phoenix, but at each 
of the baggage claim areas at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport,
you can pick up the Sedona-Phoenix Shuttle (% 800-448-7988 in
Arizona or 928-282-2066; www.sedona-phoenix-shuttle.com). The
shuttle departs eight times a day from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., with hourly
departures until 2 p.m., and the cost is $45 one-way and $85 round-trip.
You may, however, want to skip the shuttle and head straight for the car-
rental counter. Although several car-rental agencies operate in Sedona,
you have more flexibility if you rent a car at the Phoenix airport (you’re
not likely to save money, however, because of the high taxes levied on
cars rented at Sky Harbor).
From Phoenix, take I-17 to Highway 179 (Exit 298). From the airport, the
drive is about 119 miles, mostly on the freeway. Although curvy for
stretches, I-17 is wide enough that you can drive the right lane at your
own pace, letting the NASCAR-wannabe racers zoom past.
Part IV: Exploring the Regions 
300
A tasty detour
Flying into Phoenix and driving toward Sedona around feeding time? Don’t hassle with
trying to find a place to eat in the big city. On I-17, drive about 20 minutes past the out-
skirts of the city and get off on Exit 242. The signs will lead you to the Rock Springs Café
and Bakery ($–$$), 34900 N. Old Black Canyon Hwy. (% 623-374-5063), a family-style
restaurant on the site of a former stagecoach stop. Just two words of menu advice:
barbecue and pie.

Central Arizona
Chapter 16: Central Arizona 301

The Coconino Yavapai Shuttle (% 888-440-8929 or 928-775-8929) makes
regular runs to Sedona from Prescott and Flagstaff. You can pick up the
shuttle at the Flagstaff Visitor Center (see Chapter 17) at 8 a.m., or call
ahead and reserve door-to-door service. Prices in the summer of 2006
were $35 one-way from Prescott to Sedona, $25 from Flagstaff to Sedona
($60 round-trip Prescott to Sedona; $50 round-trip from Flagstaff to
Sedona) but fluctuate depending on gas costs.
The lay of the land
Before you set out on your own, get to know the lay of the land, which
isn’t as simple as you may think. The town known as Sedona really con-
sists of four distinct areas.
Coming in from Phoenix on Highway 179, you first encounter the Village
of Oak Creek, which has a designer outlet mall; a few decent, reason-
ably priced restaurants; and several lodgings, many of the motel variety.
It also has a U.S. Forest Service/Chamber of Commerce information
center — a good place to stop for tourist information and a Red Rock
Pass (see “The scenery’s free — but the parking isn’t” sidebar in this
chapter) because it’s much less crowded than the visitor center in
Sedona. Continuing north past a rapidly shrinking stretch of undevel-
oped land, you see a sign for Sedona and several upscale strip shopping
centers on your left. When you spot the shopping village of Tlaquepaque
(ta-la-ka-PA-kee) on your right, you know you’re near the “Y,” as the usu-
ally crowded intersection with Highway 89A is known (although, with
the addition of a Hyatt timeshare and shopping complex in the early
2000s, the intersection now looks more like an “X”).
Take a right on Highway 89A to get to the main visitor center and the
touristy drag called Uptown Sedona, where you have to wade through a
lot of schlock to find the gems. Several restaurants, hotels, and galleries
fall into the latter category. Beyond Uptown Sedona is Oak Creek Canyon.
Woodsy lodges and a few laid-back restaurants dot this extremely scenic
route to Flagstaff.
If you go left at the Y, you encounter West Sedona — the real people’s
town, with amenities such as supermarkets, drugstores, and movie the-
aters. Most of Sedona’s top restaurants and several of its best places to
stay are here as well. Boynton Canyon is off to the right, and, as you con-
tinue along 89A toward Prescott, you pass Red Rock State Park.
The good news: Highway 179 was designated Arizona’s first “All-
American Road” because of its scenic and historic qualities. The bad
news: The stretch between the Village of Oak Creek and the Y currently
has some of the worst traffic in the state, and that’s only likely to get
worse in the next few years, when the road is slated for improvements.
This winding, two-lane thoroughfare is lined with businesses (maybe
including your hotel) but has few turn lanes. Moreover, many people
spend the afternoon or evening sipping margaritas on the outdoor decks

of restaurants along this route. During the day, the road is usually too
congested for much harm to be done, but watch out at night, when both
the flow of both the traffic and the booze accelerates.
Spending the night
Sedona is chock-a-block with rooms with a view and guest quarters that
ooze character. Economical lodgings, on the other hand, are as rare as
traffic-free crossings at the Y intersection. In this section, I give you a
wide range of choices in the hotel and resort categories as well as in the

“The inns (but no outs) of Sedona” sidebar. The town also has several
chain hotels, which tend to be priced higher than their counterparts in
other locations. Contact the Sedona–Oak Creek Chamber of Commerce
(see the “Fast Facts: Sedona and the Verde Valley” section) for a com-
plete listing of lodgings and reservation services.
Almost all the places I list are in areas that afford the best proximity to
Sedona’s renowned red-rock vistas. If you’re up for a more woodsy experi-
ence, consider the following creekside digs in verdant Oak Creek Canyon:
Don Hoel’s Cabins ($$), 9440 N. Highway 89A (% 800-292-HOEL or
928-282-3560; www.hoels.com), fairly rustic but clean and reasonably
priced; Garland’s Oak Creek Lodge ($$$$), Highway 89A, 8 miles north of
uptown Sedona (% 928-282-3343; www.garlandslodge.com), so popular
for both its setting and excellent meals that it’s fairly impossible to get in
(closed mid-Nov to Mar); and Junipine Resort ($$$), 8351 N. Hwy. 89A 
(% 800-742-PINE or 928-282-3375; www.junipine.com), offering an
assortment of family-friendly one- and two-bedroom condos. Also read
about the Briar Patch Inn in the “The inns (but no outs) of Sedona” 
sidebar.
If economy is a top priority, you may want to hole up in Cottonwood,
about 15 miles from Sedona on Highway 89A. Its many chain hotels —
the Cottonwood Chamber of Commerce (see the “Fast Facts: Sedona and
the Verde Valley” section) can direct you to them — and its central loca-
tion make this town a particularly good base for exploring the region. On
the opposite end of the spectrum, the ghost town of Jerome has lodgings
with nothing if not personality. See the “Sleeping, eating, and drinking in
Jerome” sidebar for my hotel suggestions in and around town.
Note: In Sedona, “high season” refers roughly to mid-February through
June and September through December; July and August rates tend to
be slightly lower, and the lowest prices of all are during the first week of
January through mid-February.
Enchantment Resort/Mii amo

West Sedona
A knockout Boynton Canyon setting, rooms done in the height of
Southwest chic, and a nice array of facilities have always put Enchantment

When Theodore Schnebly, a Pennsylvania Dutch settler who bought 80 acres near

“Schnebly Station,” was too long. Luckily, his wife had a nice, short name: Sedona.

ents). The spacious, nouveau Southwest-style suites, featuring microwaves
and separate sleeping quarters for the young ’uns, are a boon to grownups,

you cozy up in your luxurious bed, listening to the musical sounds of Oak
Creek, you’re in Romance World, anyway. L’Auberge offers two types of
accommodations: appealing quarters in a main lodge building, and brook-
side cabins, all with jetted tubs and wood-burning fireplaces. Although the
property seems tucked away, you’re close to all the Uptown Sedona tour
operators and shops — not to mention the resort’s lovely French restau-
rant, which often has food to match the setting. A spa is on its way, too.

Getting creek-y
Keep in mind that central Arizona has two Oak Creeks. (Well, actually, just one body
of water but two areas near Sedona with that name.) The Village of Oak Creek on
Highway 179 is a rather nondescript town with some amazing red-rock backdrops.
Oak Creek Canyon is the lovely gorge that Highway 89A winds through en route to
Flagstaff. If you don’t distinguish between the two when you ask for directions, you
could be . . . well, up a creek.

Los Abrigados Resort & Spa
$$–$$$$
Near the Y
Although this resort operates as a time share, it has plenty to offer its
many temporary guests, including a great spa and exercise facilities, in-
your-pocket proximity to Sedona’s famed Tlaquepaque shopping village,
several lively restaurants and a sports bar — even an educational eco-
center. The best part: suites comfortable enough for long-term stays and
at rates that are economical (well, for Sedona). The nine studio rooms near
the tennis courts are a real deal. Although smaller, they have coffeemak-
ers, microwaves, and minifridges, as well as a quieter location. Just be pre-
pared to ignore the hard sell if you bed down anywhere on this property.

Sedona Reál
$$–$$$
West Sedona
For a reasonable price, you get airy, well-equipped suites that feature TVs,
VCRs, refrigerators, and microwaves (some also offer fireplaces and two-
person spas); free local phone calls and a complimentary Continental
breakfast also add value. Best of all, you don’t have to fight traffic to get
into your room. Family-harmony extra: Some suites have two TVs, and you
can get microwave popcorn and movies at the front desk. Note: In 2006
several standard rooms were added. They’re a bit smaller but offer all the
amenities of the suites — and are more economical.

Sedona Rouge
$$–$$$
West Sedona
Opened in 2005, this hotel adds a lot to the Sedona lodging scene. The
rooms are sleek and hip (flat screen TVs, huge rainforest showers, wire-
less Internet) without being spare (lots of reds and Moorish touches).
Other assets include a full-service spa and an excellent restaurant — Reds
(see “Dining locally,” in the next section); easy access to other West
Sedona eateries; and next-door proximity to the most upscale Safeway

any goodies you buy there. Hotel prices are not through the roof, either;
though if you’ve got cash to spare, you can buy most of the in-room fur-
nishings that appeal to you.

The inns (but no outs) of Sedona
When it comes to some of Sedona’s more intimate lodgings, the “bed-and-breakfast”
label is misleading. True, they offer personalized service and a generous morning meal,
but the following accommodations, all of which have at least eight guest units, bear 
a much stronger resemblance to boutique inns than they do to host homes. Expect
such perks as privileges at local health clubs and on-call massage therapists. None
of these inns has enforced communal dining, either, so you can be as friendly — or as
antisocial — as you want to be in the a.m.
Alma de Sedona ($$$), 50 Hozoni Dr., West Sedona (% 800-923-2282 or 928-282-2737;
www.almadesedona.com), takes Southwest luxury to the limit, offering beautifully
decorated rooms in a dramatic pueblo-style building with stunning red-rock vistas.
Briar Patch Inn ($$$–$$$$), 3190 N. Hwy. 89A, Oak Creek Canyon (% 888-809-3030 or
928-282-2342; www.briarpatchinn.com), features lovely 1930s cottages with
spiffy Southwestern facelifts. In summer, let live classical music soothe you at break-
fast, along with the rushing waters of Oak Creek. More rustic than the rest, this B&B
is also less pretentious.
El Portal ($$$$), 95 Portal Lane, south of the Y (% 800-313-0017 or 928-203-9405; www.
innsedona.com), is the hands-down winner in Sedona’s luxury sweepstakes — if
money is no object. The painstakingly detailed re-creation of a 1910 hacienda, replete
with valuable period antiques, is spectacular, and the amenities are endless.
The Inn on Oak Creek ($$$–$$$$), 556 Hwy. 179, south of the Y (% 800-499-7896 or 928-
282-7896; www.sedona-inn.com), counts among its many assets a private creek-
side park, creatively themed rooms, and proximity to Tlaquepaque’s shops and to
hiking trails.
Sunset Chateau ($$–$$$), 665 S. Sunset Dr., West Sedona (% 888-988-3988; www.
asunsetchateau.com), not only has good rates — especially with its stunning red-
rock views — but its vibrant, colorful suites have kitchenettes, so you can stretch that
budget further.

if you book a room here. The grounds, with old-growth trees and gardens,
are lovely; the rooms, although simple, have touches that add character
(some offer decks and/or fireplaces). You have access to a pool and hot
tub, and you get some of the most spectacular red-rock views in town for
some of the most reasonable rates.

Dining locally
Sedona has fewer dining choices than lodging options, but with a popu-
lation of only about 17,000, it definitely outdoes most towns its size, 
culinary-wise. It doesn’t hurt (except in the pocketbook) that many of
Sedona’s transplanted residents have the sophisticated palates that
often come along with high-priced real estate.
In addition to the places listed, ask around about the chefs at the Yavapai
Room at Enchantment and the restaurant at L’Auberge de Sedona (both
resorts are detailed in the “Spending the night” section of this chapter).
These two fine-dining rooms are ultraromantic, with coveted views, but
they’re also ultraexpensive, and the food doesn’t always warrant the
financial outlay. Also check out the “A taste of Roma in Sedona” sidebar.
The Cowboy Club’s Silver Saddle Room
$$$–$$$$
Uptown Sedona
AMERICAN/SOUTHWESTERN
Who would have figured a place called the Cowboy Club in the touristy
hub of uptown Sedona would dish up sophisticated Southwest fare? The
kitchen of one of Sedona’s only historical structures turns out trendy appe-
tizers, such as buffalo brochettes and entrees like pistachio-crusted hal-
ibut. The heaping plates of the more traditional ribs, steaks, and chops are
deservedly popular, too.

D’lish

West Sedona
VEGETARIAN/VEGAN
Given the town’s focus on spirituality, Sedona’s dearth of vegan — or even
vegetarian — options always surprised me. All that has changed with the
debut of D’lish, with vegan food that lives up the restaurant’s name. The
sandwiches, wraps, salads, and generous platters are all super tasty, and
the small storefront, with a few tables on a terrace, is bright, cheery, and
laid-back. In short, this is everything a healthy eatery should be.

Heartline Café
$$$–$$$$
West Sedona
NEW AMERICAN
Though it was one of the town’s first restaurants to focus on fresh, regional
ingredients, Heartline’s recipe has never grown tired. A friendly (but not
obnoxiously so) staff serves some of the most interesting dishes in town
in a cheery dark-wood dining room or on a pretty outdoor patio. The cul-
tural mix-it-up menu includes such appetizers as sautéed lobster chunks
with corn blinis, and entrees like grilled salmon with tequila-lime mari-
nade. Heartline’s more casual takeout and market, opened next door in
2005, offers the same high-quality items, like the Asian noodle salad or
Kobe-beef burger.

South of the Y
MEXICAN
The Javelina Cantina is one of Sedona’s most popular — and liveliest —
eateries. The specialty margaritas flow like water in this sprawling, oh-so-
Southwest dining room; seats on the redwood deck with red-rock views
are naturally the most coveted. The name of the game is tasty and fresh if
Americanized Mexican food — tacos, tamales, enchilada combos, huge tor-
tilla-base salads. Kids have a separate menu, and, with all the hubbub,
most whining goes unnoticed.

Morphing from a chic, cheery breakfast and lunch spot during the day to
a swanky supper club after dark, Reds has something to match your culi-

mac-and-cheese made with aged cheddar and house-baked ham, meatloaf
that’s topped with a wild mushroom demiglacé — but lighter meals, like
creative salads and seafood dishes, are also available. With its terrific egg
dishes and top-notch coffee, Reds is my new favorite breakfast spot in
Sedona.

Exploring Sedona and the Verde Valley
Sedona is strong on splendor and sports, but not so big on history. If
you want to explore the area’s rich mining and Native American past,
tour the Verde Valley (which is no slouch in the scenery department,
although not as dramatic).
Part IV: Exploring the Regions 
310
A taste of Roma in Sedona
Maybe it’s because marinara sauce matches the red rocks. Or perhaps New Agers
have been channeling chefs from Italy who’ve crossed over to the other side.
Whatever the reason, Sedona has an abundance of good Italian restaurants. These
are my favorites, for different prices, occasions, and locations (although West Sedona
has the most options).
A Pizza Heaven ($–$$), 2675 W. Hwy. 89A, West Sedona (% 928-282-0519), offers more
than just good pizza (although it definitely has that covered). Come here for super-size
heroes and lasagna as cheesy and saucy as it’s supposed to be.
Cucina Rustica ($$$–$$$$), 7000 Hwy. 179, Suite 126A, at Tequa Marketplace, Village
of Oak Creek (% 928-284-3010), is a more recent entry on the upscale Italian dining
scene by the founders of Dahl & DiLuca (see the following entry). The Mediterranean
villa setting is gorgeous, and the menu sometimes puts a Southwest spin on the
(mostly) Northern Italian specialties. Just opened in 2006, next door’s A’roma
(% 928-284-1556), an Italian market with sandwiches, salads, olives, and wines, is
perfect for picnic fixin’s.
Dahl & DiLuca ($$$–$$$$), 2321 W. Hwy. 89A, West Sedona (% 928-282-5219), a cozy
candlelit room with hand-decorated walls, is the setting for starters such as mush-
rooms stuffed with mozzarella and fresh basil, followed, perhaps, by linguini in
pomodora vodka sauce with prawns, all expertly turned out by Rome-born chef Andrea
DiLuca.
The Hideaway ($$), 122 Hwy. 179 at Country Square, south of the Y (% 928-282-4204),
serves up spectacular red-rock views and decent Southern Italian food at prices
below those of most restaurants in Sedona. A nice bonus: The kitchen creates its own
sauces and spices.
Pietro’s ($$$–$$$$), 2445 W. Hwy. 89A, West Sedona (% 928-282-4140), may not serve
the type of pizza you grew up with — possible ingredients include Thai chicken,
jalapeños, and andouille sausage — but it’s delicious, as are the (huge) creative salads
that make great accompaniments or meals on their own.
Troia’s ($$–$$$), 1885 W. Hwy. 89A, West Sedona (% 928-282-0123), doesn’t generate
the press a lot of the newer restaurants do, but it almost invariably turns up on lists of
local favorites. Pluses include a relaxed but elegant atmosphere, a large menu rang-
ing from pizza to steak and seafood, and a nice outdoor deck.

If you drive up from Phoenix during daylight hours, detour off I-17 en
route to Sedona to visit Montezuma’s Castle and — if you’re a military-
history buff — Fort Verde. You may enjoy Jerome, Tuzigoot, and the
Verde Valley Railroad when you’re red-rock sated. Keep in mind, too,
that Jerome is about halfway between Sedona and Prescott on Highway
89A. If you want to visit Prescott from Sedona, build some extra time
into your schedule for Jerome.
Wondering what gives Sedona’s rosy rocks their color? The brightest red
of the three layers of sandstone got its distinct hue when iron minerals
mixed with oxygen to form iron oxide — in other words, rust.
The top attractions
Arcosanti
Started in 1970 but still far from completed, this desert community
embodies architect Paolo Soleri’s vision of a world without suburban
sprawl. Whether you come away convinced that you’ve seen the future
and that Soleri’s vision could, in fact, work, or you think Arcosanti is
New Age hokum, the guided tours of the grounds give you food for
thought. Get more substantial fare at Arcosanti’s excellent bakery/cafe,
and then browse the gift shop for Soleri windbells and other crafts cre-
ated on-site.
Not only is it far from any other major attractions, but to get here, you
need to drive about 11⁄2 miles on a dusty, bumpy dirt road (close your win-
dows and go slowly). Tours last about an hour, but since this place is lit-
erally off the beaten path — and because you’ll want to factor in time for
the bakery and bell shopping — you’ll need at least two and a half hours,
minimum.
See map p. 301. Exit 262 from I-17 and follow the signs. % 928-632-6217. www.
arcosanti.org. Admission: $8 (suggested donation). Daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m., closed
Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year’s; tours every hour on the hour 10 a.m.–4 p.m.
except at noon.
Jerome
A bustling, rough ’n’ tumble mining camp in the early 1900s — the popu-
lation rose and fell with the price of copper, climbing up to about 15,000
in the late 1920s — Jerome earned its “ghost town” label after the last
mine was shut down in 1953 and only 50 people stuck around the moun-
tain. The town had a hippie and biker resurgence in the 1960s, and now
some 450 folks, many of them artsy and craftsy, call Jerome home.
Despite interesting shopping (see the “Shopping for local treasures” sec-
tion later in this section) and fascinating history, another reason to wind
your way some 2,000 feet up the side of Cleopatra Hill is for the views.
On a clear day, you really can see forever. The Verde Valley spreads out
below you, flanked by Sedona, the multihued Mogollon Rim, and the San
Francisco Peaks, Arizona’s highest mountains.
Chapter 16: Central Arizona 311

Jerome is about 25 miles southwest of Sedona via Highway 89A en route
to Prescott. (If you’re coming from Prescott, be aware that a popular
Jerome T-shirt boasts that you’ll be negotiating 158 curves in 12 miles.)
If you want to stay in town for a while, see this chapter’s “Sleeping,
eating, and drinking in Jerome” sidebar. I list hours for the town’s few
formal sights in this section, but don’t hold me to them (except in the
case of the state park). The attitude toward time in Jerome is, shall we
say, relaxed. While you’re here, you can:
 See how the other half lived. The mansion that’s the centerpiece
of Jerome State Historic Park, off Highway 89A on Douglas Road
(% 928-634-5381), used to belong to Little Daisy mine owner
“Rawhide Jimmy” Douglas. His original furniture sits among the 
displays, which include ore samples and mining equipment. The
introductory film has a corny ghost narrator, but it’s worth sitting
through for the historical overview. Note: This mansion is also 
the town’s unofficial visitor center. Admission is $3 adults, free for
ages 13 and under when accompanied by an adult. It’s open daily
8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., except Christmas. See map p. 301.

Sleeping, eating, and drinking in Jerome
For a ghost town, Jerome lays on lots of corporeal comforts. Here are my top picks
for the best sleeps, eats, and drinks.
Lodging: A great location on the town’s main street, antique furnishings, modern
amenities, and reasonable rates all make the Connor Hotel ($–$$), 164 Main St. 
(% 800-523-3554 or 928-634-5006; www.connorhotel.com), hard to beat. Unlike
many so-called historic lodgings, this place was actually built to be a hotel (in 1898).
A former miner’s boarding house, the Ghost City Inn B&B ($$), 541 Main St. (% 888-
634-4678 or 928-634-4678; www.ghostcityinn.com), counts among its many assets
great Verde Valley views, generous breakfasts, and Harley-Davidson rentals.
Dining: The Flatiron Cafe ($), 416 Main St. (% 928-634-2733), is the place to come for
your morning latte or midday smoked salmon quesadilla. At the Red Rooster Café ($),
363 Main St. (% 928-634-7087), follow a cup of fresh-made soup and Greek salad with
some killer croissant bread pudding. Mellow deck views, a good bar, and hearty grilled
fare make the Haunted Hamburger ($–$$), 410 Clark St. (% 928-634-0554), a local
dinner favorite. The most upscale eatery in town (white tablecloths and everything!),
the Asylum ($$$), 200 Hill St., at the Jerome Grand Hotel (% 928-639-3197), serves
good versions of such dishes as steamed artichokes with aioli and grilled Australian
lobster trails.
Nightlife: Jerome’s rowdy days are far from over. Bikers, hippies, and yuppies all pile
into the Spirit Room, Main Street and Highway 89A (% 928-634-8809), and Paul and
Jerry’s Saloon, just down Main Street (% 928-634-2603), especially on live-music
afternoons and evenings during the weekend.

 Mine more of the town’s history. Among its many documents and
artifacts, the Jerome Historical Society and Mine Museum, 200
Main St. (% 928-634-5477; www.jeromehistoricalsociety.org),
includes stock certificates in mind-boggling amounts. Admission 
is $2 for adults, $1 for seniors 60 and older, and children 12 and
under are free. It’s open daily 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., but it’s closed at
Christmas and Thanksgiving.
The displays at the Gold King Mine and Ghost Town, Perkinsville
Road (follow the signs about 1 mile from the center of town; % 928-
634-0053), mix history with hype, but poking around the ruins of the
town’s once hugely wealthy gold mine is fun. Admission is $4 adults,
$3 for seniors ages 62 through 74, $2 ages 6 to 12, and children 5 and
under and adults over 75 are free. It’s open daily 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
except Christmas.
Montezuma Castle National Monument
Near the town of Camp Verde
You may find larger remains of early Native American living quarters in the
Southwest, but few are as well preserved and as easily viewed as these
two 12th-century Sinagua cliff dwellings. Beaver Creek flows through this
tree-shaded area — which explains why the Sinagua built homes here and
why you’ll especially enjoy your visit. A leisurely stroll around the guided
loop path doesn’t take more than a half hour. Devote another 15 minutes
or so to the small visitor center museum, which traces the history of the
Sinaguas in the Verde Valley.
If you have time, get back on I-17 heading toward Flagstaff and take the next
(McGuireville) turnoff. Signs direct you to Montezuma Well, which is part
of the national monument (same hours, no fee). It is a huge, strikingly blue
spring-fed pool, some 368 feet across and 65 feet deep. Another easy side
trip from Montezuma’s Castle is to Fort Verde (see the following section,
“More cool things to see and do”). If you need to choose between these two
side trips because of time constraints, I vote for Montezuma Well.
See map p. 301. Exit 289 from I-17 and follow the signs. % 928-567-3322. www.nps.
gov/moca. Admission: $5, ages 16 and under free, free with Golden Age/Golden
Eagle passes. May 30–Labor Day 8 a.m.–6 p.m.; rest of the year 8 a.m.–5 p.m.
Out of Africa Wildlife Park
Lions and tigers and giraffes . . . oh my! Though still a work in progress —
when I visited in spring 2006, not all the transportation kinks had been
worked out, and the Tiger Splash exhibit was not yet opened — the park
is already destined to be a great family destination. The Wildlife Preserve
is where you can watch animals roam in large habitats — not to mention
get fed raw meat (on Sun, Wed, and Fri at 3pm) — and the Serengeti Safari
(my favorite) is where you get to do the feeding. The giraffes are especially
friendly, and the tour guides very informative.
Chapter 16: Central Arizona 313

Plan to spend at least three hours here in order to see everything and to
get your money’s worth. And avoid coming on really warm days; this place
has a lot of dust and not a lot of shade.
See map p. 301. Exit 287 from I-17, go 3 miles on Hwy 260 toward Cottonwood, and
follow the signs. % 928-567-2840. www.outofafricapark.com. Admission: $36
adults, $34 seniors, $28 ages 3–12, free for ages 2 and under. Wed–Sun 9:30 a.m.–5
p.m. (last admission at 4p.m.), and Dec 26–New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King Day,
President’s Day, Easter, Memorial Day, and Labor Day.
Sedona/Oak Creek Canyon
Few activities in or near Sedona involve taxing your brain cells — except
maybe calculating how close you are to maxing out your credit cards. This
town is mainly about gazing at stunning scenery. The following list
includes numerous ways to do just that — without expending too much
energy.
 See some stately rocks. The rusty sandstone cliffs that fall under
the aegis of Red Rock State Park, 4050 Lower Red Rock Loop Road
(% 928-282-6907; www.azstateparks.com) are no more exciting
than any of the others in this area, but this is a good place to walk
along some gentle trails near Oak Creek and take advantage of such
ranger-led activities as nature walks (10 a.m. daily) and bird watch-
ing excursions (call for schedules). The turnoff for the park is 2
miles beyond West Sedona on Highway 89A. Admission is $6 per
car with up to four people, $1 additional per each additional pas-
senger. Hours are daily October through March 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.;
April and September daily from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.; and May through
August daily 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. See map p. 303.
 Go slip-sliding away. The natural water slide in Oak Creek explains
the name of Slide Rock State Park, 6871 N. Hwy. 89A, 7 miles north
of Sedona in Oak Creek Canyon (% 928-282-3034; www.azstate
parks.com). The slide — along with a volleyball net, the pizza-sell-
ing Slide Rock Market, and picnic tables — also makes this park a
major summer party place and family gathering ground. After the
warm weather sets in, hardly a parking spot can be found after 10
a.m. Several trailheads are in this area, too. Admission is $10 per
car with up to four adults (13 and under are free) in summer, $8 
in the rest of the year, $2 per additional visitor. It’s open daily in
summer 8 a.m. to 7 p.m., winter 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., and fall and spring
8 a.m. to 6 p.m. See map p. 301.
 Get spiritual. You don’t have to subscribe to any particular creed
to want to visit the Chapel of the Holy Cross (% 928-282-4069),
built in 1956 by a protégé of Frank Lloyd Wright. Like her mentor,
Marguerite Brunwige Staude knew the importance of working with
her surroundings, and this simple, clean-lined house of worship
seems to have sprung from the red cliffs that surround it. Look 
for the cross on the right side of Highway 179 as you head north
toward the Y from the Village of Oak Creek, and turn right on
Chapel Road. It’s open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. See map p. 303.
Part IV: Exploring the Regions 
314

 Go multicultural. Opened in 2005, The Healing Nautilus, 3190 West
Highway 89A, Suite 100 (% 928-282-1298; www.ringingrocks.org),
explores healing traditions throughout the world in several fascinat-
ing displays. There’s no admission charge to enter this lovely space,
created by the nonprofit Ringing Rocks Foundation, but you may find
a use for your money in the adjacent bookstore. It’s open Monday to
Saturday 10am to 5p.m.
 Soak up some history. Okay, so I lied. A couple of attractions in
this area do cater to people who like to revisit the past. Slide Rock
State Park (described earlier in this section) was originally Pendley
Homestead, an apple farm established in 1910. Rangers sometimes
run tours (phone ahead to Slide Rock State Park), and you can walk
the easy .25 mile Pendley Homestead Trail through some of the
original apple orchards and past the homestead house, tourist
cabins, and apple-packing barn. Apples are for sale in season.
The Sedona Heritage Museum, 735 Jordan Rd., uptown Sedona 
(% 928-282-7038; www.sedonamuseum.org), also gives a feel (or is
that a peel?) for an era when apple-growing was a major source of
income in this region. Exhibits on the lovely woods-flanked prop-
erty include an apple-packing shed and a 45-foot-long apple-sorting
machine. You also find a room devoted to film — dozens of Westerns
have used Sedona as a backdrop. Admission is $3 for adults, and
ages 11 and under are free. Hours are daily 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.; closed
major holidays. See map p. 303.
 Discover rock art. If you don’t mind putting a bit of wear on your
tires on (more-or-less) graded dirt roads, the area’s low-key Native
American sites are well worth a visit. Palatki, on the west side of
Sedona, features a cliff dwelling and lots of petroglyphs, some
dating back 6,000 years. Three miles away but even tougher on the
suspension system, Honanki has more extensive ruins but less
interesting rock art. The best petroglyphs of all are at V-Bar-V
Ranch, located en route to Sedona, near the junction of I-17 and
Highway 179. All three sites have limited hours of access, and direc-
tions to them are a bit complicated. You need a Red Rock Pass (see
“The scenery’s free — but the parking isn’t” sidebar) to visit them,
so get directions, hours, and road conditions at the U.S. ranger sta-
tion where you purchase the pass.
Tuzigoot National Monument
Just outside Clarkdale
The group of Sinagua Indians who lived in Montezuma’s Castle (see the
listing earlier in this section) went for the creekside real estate. Their kin
who settled at Tuzigoot between the years 1125 A.D. and 1400 A.D. liked the
hilltop property, prime both for protection purposes (enemies approach-
ing from anywhere around the Verde Valley could be spotted from there)
and for the adjacent fertile farmland that the Hohokam Indians had left
Chapter 16: Central Arizona 315

behind. These days, some of the views are spoiled by a slag field left over
from the mines at nearby Jerome and by a huge cement plant tower, but
this spot is still scenic. Doing the slightly hilly loop around the pueblo com-
plex takes about a half hour; add another ten minutes for the museum/vis-
itor center.
See map p. 301. Broadway Road (off Highway 89A, between Old Town Cottonwood
and Clarkdale). % 928-634-5564. www.nps.gov/tuzi. Admission: $5; ages 15 and
under and Golden Age/Golden Eagle pass holders free. May 30–Labor Day 8a.m.–6
p.m., the day after Labor Day through May 29 8 a.m.–5 p.m.; closed Christmas.
More cool things to see and do
Here you have more options for spending time outdoors, whether you
want to explore an old fort or play cowboy.
 Visit a historic fort. A museum and several reconstructed officers’
quarters in Fort Verde State Historic Park, 125 E. Hollamon St.,
Camp Verde (% 928-567-3275; www.azstateparks.com), tell the
story of this fairly short-lived (1871–1891) military installation.
Established to protect Verde Valley from Indian raids, the fort
supervised the forced displacement of the Yavapai and Tonto
Apaches to reservations in Eastern Arizona. To get there, follow the
signs from any of the three Camp Verde exits on I-17. (Only the first,
if you’re coming from Phoenix, is marked “Fort Verde,” but all three
lead to downtown, where the park is located.) Admission is $2 for
adults, and children 13 and under are free. It’s open daily 8 a.m. to 5
p.m., except on Christmas, when it’s closed. See map p. 301.
 Be a cowpoke. The Blazin’ M Ranch, off 10th Street in Cottonwood
(% 800-937-8643; www.blazinm.com), is a replica of an Old West
town, replete with pony rides, a shooting gallery, and, of course,
souvenir shops. But most people come for the chuck wagon sup-
pers and Western stage shows, held nightly Wednesday through
Sunday (closed Jan). For $35 adults, $33 seniors, $25 ages 12 and
under (3 and under free), you get a good homespun all-you-can-eat

What color is your aura?
Chakras blocked? Past lives eluding you? Not to worry. Sedona has something to meet
your every psychic or spiritual need. But there are plenty of folks who prey on visitors’
vulnerabilities to part them from their money. It’s best to get a referral from a trusted
source. You may contact the Sedona Metaphysical Spiritual Association (% 928-
282-8981 or 928-284-3257; www.sedonaspiritual.com). This organization is affil-
iated with the Sedona Chamber of Commerce — which gives their recommendations
credibility.

dinner and good, clean Country and Western entertainment. The
ranch has teamed up with Verde Canyon Railroad (see “Take the
last train from Clarkdale” sidebar later in this chapter), so opening
times (5 p.m., with dinner starting at 6:30 p.m.) coordinate with
train schedules. To get here, follow the signs to Dead Horse Ranch
State Park, and turn left just past the entrance.
Guided tours
All the following tours are given in Sedona. Also look for the “Take the
last train from Clarkdale” sidebar for excursions on the Verde Canyon
Railroad.
 General tours: If you want to survey the lay of the land, board the
Sedona Trolley (% 928-282-5400; www.sedonatrolley.com). 
Two 55-minute tours depart from the Sedona Center in Uptown
Sedona. One (10 a.m., noon, 2 p.m., 4 p.m.) goes along Highway 179
to Tlaquepaque, the Chapel of the Holy Cross, and gallery row. The
other (9.a.m., 11 a.m., 1 p.m., 3 p.m., 5 p.m.) visits West Sedona, some
scenic canyons, and Enchantment Resort. The cost is $10 adults ($5
ages 12 and under) for one tour or $18 ($9) for both tours.
 Air tours: Feeling a bit too grounded? Tour operators in Sedona
cater to every lofty inclination. If you go for a hot-air-balloon ride,
you are picked up at your hotel. If you’re up for a helicopter or
small plane jaunt, drive to the Sedona Airport (turn off Highway
89A west of the Y onto Airport Road and keep going up to the top
of the hill).
• By hot-air balloon: Wind conditions permitting, Red 
Rock Balloon Adventures (% 800-258-3754; www.redrock
balloons.com) can take you up, up, and away for a minimum
of an hour, then reward you with a champagne picnic and
proof-of-flight certificate. The $195-per-person fee also
includes one free video of your trip per reservation.
• By helicopter: Prices for a 12-minute tour of Cathedral Rock,
Bell Rock, and other Sedona landmarks start at $58 per person
from Arizona Helicopter Adventures (% 800-282-5141 or
928-282-0904; www.azheli.com) and top off at $630 per person
for a two-and-a-half-hour excursion beyond the red rock
canyons to the Grand Canyon.
 Jeep tours: Pink Jeep, 204 N. Hwy. 89A, uptown Sedona (% 800-
873-3662 or 928-282-5000; www.pinkjeep.com), is the largest and
most blushingly conspicuous of Sedona’s many off-road tour opera-
tors. You can choose from seven adventures ranging from a 90-
minute Canyon West jaunt ($45) to a four-hour archaeological tour
of both Ancient Ruin and Diamondback Gulch ($102).
Chapter 16: Central Arizona 317

Tooling around off-road has become so popular in Sedona that you often
end up just bumping along and inhaling dust from the vehicle in front of
you. And the tours are becoming increasingly destructive to the natural
environment, tearing up roads and creating noise pollution. If you do
decide to take a tour, ask how many other jeeps will take part in your
group’s adventure. Your guide’s knowledge also makes a huge difference
in your enjoyment, so find out how long he or she has been in town.
Staying active
Looking for even more ways to get some fresh air in Sedona? Here are a
few that take advantage of the area’s lures. In addition, the Sedona
Chamber of Commerce (see the “Fast Facts: Sedona and Verde Valley”
section) can direct you to a variety of places to golf and get spa treat-
ments (all that outdoor activity is going to strain your muscles and dry
out your skin, right?).
 Mountain Biking: Sedona is a mountain-biker’s mecca. Sedona Bike
& Bean Shop, 6020 Hwy. 179, Village of Oak Creek (% 928-284-0210;
www.bike-bean.com); Mountain Bike Heaven, 1695 W. Hwy. 89A,
West Sedona (% 928-282-1312; www.mountainbikeheaven.com),
and Absolute Bikes, 6101 Hwy. 179, Suite C, Village of Oak Creek 
(% 928-284-1242; www.absolutebikes.net/sedona), all offer
rentals. Only the first two offer hourly rentals, both with a two-hour
minimum. Prices range from $13 per hour to $70 per 24-hour day.
 Fishing: Anglers of all ages have fun at the stocked Rainbow Trout
Farm, 3500 N. Hwy. 89A, 3 miles north of Sedona in Oak Creek
Canyon (% 928-282-5799; open, weather permitting Mon–Fri 9 a.m.–
6 p.m., Sat–Sun 9 a.m.–7 p.m.; closed in winter). For a $1 admission

Take the last train from Clarkdale
Chug-a-lug amid some of the most arresting scenery in Arizona on the Verde Canyon
Railroad, 300 N. Broadway, Clarkdale (% 800-293-7245 or 800-320-0718; www.verde
canyonrr.com). You ride rails that formerly transported tons of ore from Jerome’s
United Verde Copper Mine. The four-hour round-trip ride through a protected wilder-
ness area in a red-rock canyon has some historical constants — the ghost town of
Perkinsville and a few Native American cliff dwellings, for example — but nature puts
on a different show each season. The bald eagle watch from December through
March is the most renowned, but fall foliage, spring wildflowers, and summer water-
falls are pretty impressive, too. In addition to the regular runs, special starlight and
wine-tasting rides are offered in the summer. Schedules vary by season; except in
January, the time of most limited service, you can expect at least afternoon trains four
times a week. In peak times, especially March, April, October, and November, extra
rides fill the schedule. Rates are $55 adults, $50 seniors (ages 65 and older), and $35
children (ages 2–12) in coach, $80 for all in first-class. See map p. 301.

fee, you get a pole with a hook and bait. After that, you pay accord-
ing to the size of your catch, from $7 to $11 per fish (pipsqueak spec-
imens under 8 in. are free). You pay another 50¢ each if you want to
take the fish back clean. Maximum stay: two hours.
 Hiking: You’ll find even more trailheads than vortexes in this primo
trekking region. Some of the most popular hiking spots are Boynton
Canyon and Loy Canyon in West Sedona; the trails leading to Bell
Rock along Highway 179; and the West Fork Trail in Oak Creek
Canyon. Check with one of the U.S. Forest Service offices (see the
“Fast Facts: Sedona and Verde Valley” section) regarding the length
and difficulty of the various trails. These offices can also tell you if
you need to buy a Red Rock Pass (see “The scenery’s free — but
the parking isn’t” sidebar) for the area in which you want to hike.
For other hiking suggestions, see the “Exploring Sedona and the
Verde Valley” section earlier in this chapter.
 Horseback riding: At Trail Horse Adventures (% 800-723-3538;
www.trailhorseadventures.com), rates start at $63 per person
for a one-hour guided ride. Excursions of two hours ($75) or longer
take you through Coconino National Forest and across Oak Creek, a
stream fording unique to this outfitter. Sedona Red Rock Jeep
Tours, 217 N. Hwy. 89A, uptown Sedona (% 800-848-7728; www.
redrockjeep.com), trade four wheels for four-legged transport for
trots around a working cattle ranch that start at $64 for one hour.
Both outfitters offer dinner rides with cowboy cookouts.
Shopping for local treasures
Both Sedona and Jerome are prime retail stops, particularly if you covet
arts and crafts of the Southwestern and Western persuasion.
Where to look and what to buy in Sedona
Shoppers practice conspicuous consumption on almost every square
foot of (paved) Sedona, but retail is most concentrated in two areas:
Uptown Sedona and the stretch along Highway 179 from the town limit
Chapter 16: Central Arizona 319
The scenery’s free — but the parking isn’t
You can view Sedona’s red rocks all you like from your car, but if you want to get up
close and personal with them on U.S. Forest Service land (and there’s a lot of it in this
area), you’ll have to buy a Red Rock Pass ($5 per day, $15 per week, $20 per year).
Passes are available at Sedona’s visitor centers (see the “Fast Facts: Sedona and the
Verde Valley” section), at various trailheads, and at many local stores and hotels. For
additional information about where to buy the passes and the areas to which they
afford access, call % 928-203-7500 or 928-282-4119, or log on to www.redrock
country.org.

sign north to the Y. The east side of Highway 179 hosts several shopping
strips, the best known and most upscale of which are Hillside Sedona,
671 Hwy. 179 (% 928-282-4500; www.hillsidesedona.com) and Hozho
Distinctive Shops & Galleries, 431 Hwy. 179 (% 928-204-2257). On the
west side of the road as you approach the Y is the jewel in Sedona’s
shopping crown, Tlaquepaque Arts & Crafts Village, 336 Hwy. 179 
(% 928-282-4838; www.tlaq.com), a replica of the shopping town out-
side of Guadalajara, Mexico (except you won’t find bargaining — or 
bargains — here). Even if you don’t want to buy anything, drop in to
stroll around the two charming plazas of this red-tile-roof complex.
Tlaquepaque even has a small wedding chapel.
Large parking lots adjoin Tlaquepaque, but the places to leave your car
at Hillside and Hozho are more limited. You may have to drive around
for a while in a rather tight area before a space opens up.
In addition to the storefronts lining Highway 89A and the galleries along
Jordan Road, uptown Sedona features two main shopping complexes:
Sinagua Plaza, 270 N. Hwy. 89A (% 928-282-0641), and Sedona Center,
310 N. Hwy 89A (% 928-282-4527).
Don’t bother cruising congested Highway 89A for a spot in uptown
Sedona in the busy season. Free of charge, you can leave your car in the
lot behind the Chamber of Commerce (see the “Fast Facts: Sedona and
the Verde Valley” section) or in the larger, two-level one in the back of
Sinagua Plaza.
Two newer retail centers to look out for are Tequa Festival Marketplace,
7000 Hwy. 179, Village of Oak Creek, and the Shops at Piñon Pointe, 
101 N. Highway 89A, in the Hyatt Vacation Club complex, right at the Y 
(% 928-282-8884). Both of these upscale complexes promise a combina-
tion of national chains (Chico’s at Piñon Point, for example) and one-of-a-
kind retail and dining (Cucina Rustica at Tequa).
The relatively small Oak Creek Factory Outlets, 6601 S. Hwy. 179, Village
of Oak Creek (% 888-545-7227 or 928-284-2150), includes the Gap, Tommy
Hilfiger, Oneida, Nine West, Bass, and more.
Art galleries and Southwestern crafts boutiques dominate at the shop-
ping complexes mentioned; Hozho is particularly strong on art,
Tlaquepaque on crafts. Which shops are the best? I could devote
another entire book — not to mention my life’s savings — to Sedona’s
shops. So I’ll just mention a couple that are off the beaten path. One of
Arizona’s (and possibly the world’s) best places to buy Native American
weavings and other crafts is Garland’s Navajo Rugs, 411 Hwy. 179 at
Schnebly Hill Road (% 928-282-4070). Bob McLean Custom Bootmaker,
40 Soldiers Pass Road, West Sedona (% 928-204-1211), is a division of
the Paul Bond Boot Company in Nogales (see Chapter 15 for details on
Part IV: Exploring the Regions 
320

this artful footwear). For additional information on some of the top 
galleries in town, visit the Sedona Gallery Association online at www.
sedonagalleryassociation.com.
Where to look and what to buy in Jerome
Shopping in Jerome is easier than in Sedona: All the shops are on Main
Street with some additional shops on Hull Avenue, just around the bend.
The Jerome Artists Cooperative, 502 Main St. (% 928-634-4276), is a
good spot for a general survey of some of the town’s best crafts at some
of the best prices (yes, even funky Jerome is going upscale). I’ve put in 
a fair share of time trying on floppy hats and colorful Southwestern
clothes at Designs on You, 233 Main St. (% 928-634-7879). Other retail-
ers on my regular check-in list include Nelly Bly, 136 Main St. (% 928-
634-0255), with an unusual collection of kaleidoscopes, and Raku Gallery,
250 Hull Ave. (% 928-634-5339), a former brothel that specializes in
reproductions of risqué Victorian posters, postcards, and outfits.
Living it up after dark
For many years, Sedona was dead after dark, but now the town is far 
less moribund when the sun sets. At the original Oak Creek Brewing
Company, 2050 Yavapai Dr., off Highway 89A in West Sedona (% 928/
204-1300; www.oakcreekbrew.com), good suds, live music on the week-
ends, and a cool courtyard with a fire pit (in winter) draw a party-hearty
crowd. Younger sibling Oak Creek Brewery & Grill, 336 Hwy 179 in
Tlaquepaque (in Tlaquepaque Arts Village 1/4 mile south of the intersec-
tion with Hwy 89A; % 928/282-3300; www.oakcreekpub.com), doesn’t
have live sounds, but it does have food — and a lively young singles
crowd. Relics Restaurant & Nightclub, 3235 W. Hwy. 89A, West Sedona
(% 928/282-1593), has been boot scootin’ and hootin’ since the 1940s,
when the Duke and other Western legends of the silver screen wet their
whistles here (under the earlier name of Rainbow’s End). Casa Rincon &
Tapas Cantina, 2620 W. Hwy. 89A, West Sedona (% 928/282-4849), lays
on an eclectic array of nightly entertainment, from classical Spanish
guitar to funk and DJ dance parties. For a sophisticated retro experience,
stop by the lounge at Reds in the Sedona Rouge Hotel (see the “Dining
locally” section earlier in this chapter). In addition, Cucina Rustica and
Dahl & DiLucaPizza Picazzo (see the “A taste of Roma in Sedona” sidebar)
are among the local restaurants that offer live music on the weekends.
Perhaps someday the impressive Sedona Cultural Park — opened in 2000
and closed a few years later — will become a full blown arts venue again.
In the meantime, the small, local Canyon Moon Theatre Company, 1370
W. Hwy. 89A, Suite 6 (% 928-282-6212; www.canyonmoontheatre.org),
fills Sedona’s performance arts needs. In addition, the town offers many
cultural events, just not at permanent venues; see the Sedona Arts
Alliance (www.sedonaartsalliance.com) for details.

Part IV: Exploring the Regions 
322
Fast Facts: Sedona and the Verde Valley
A region for all seasons
When southern Arizonans want to experience the four seasons as most of the coun-
try knows them, they head for the White Mountains, northeast of Sedona and the
Verde Valley. It’s a beautiful area, laced with lakes, lush with pines, and dotted with
small, rural towns — but not what most out-of-staters come to see on an initial visit
to Arizona (which is why I don’t devote a lot of space to it).
But if you do come, you won’t be disappointed. Starting east from the Verde Valley,
highlights include Payson, popularized by Western author Zane Grey, who had a cabin
just outside the town; the nearby Tonto Natural Bridge State Park, showcasing the
world’s largest travertine arch; and Pine and Strawberry, sprinkled with crafts and
antiques shops.

Prescott
Lots of resident college students and retirees, plus waves of heat-escap-
ing Phoenicians, have given Prescott an orientation toward pleasure. The
hub of north-central Arizona, the town is much more of a real-people
place than Sedona. But if you’re looking for a Southwest stereotype, you
won’t find it here: With its oak-shaded central square, Victorian houses,
and temperate climate, Prescott feels almost Midwestern. That said, the
rugged rocks of the nearby Granite Dells could come straight out of a
John Ford film, and you find plenty of places to saddle up. If you like the
outdoors, antiques, and history, you can easily spend a few days relaxing
here. Prescott is also a relatively inexpensive base for exploring the
Verde Valley; a daytrip to the Grand Canyon from here is doable, too.
Getting there
Though I don’t recommend flying into Prescott (see Chapter 7), if you
must do so, Great Lakes Aviation (% 800-554-5111; www.flygreat
lake.com) will take you into Prescott via Sky Harbor International
Airport in Phoenix.
If you drive from Phoenix, take I-17 north to Highway 69 West (at Exit
262, Cordes Junction); the trip is a quick 96 miles. From Sedona, take
Highway 89A southwest (89A merges with Highway 89, 5 miles north of
town). But consider yourself forewarned: this 60-mile route has some
very curvy stretches. You can also take Highway 179 south from Sedona
to I-17 South, and then head west on Highway 169 and 69 — less scenic,
Chapter 16: Central Arizona 323
The 1.5-million-acre Fort Apache Indian Reservation is home to Arizona’s largest ski
area, Sunrise Park, as well as to Fort Apache Historic Park, featuring a museum and
cultural center, and the nearby Kinishba Ruin, so tranquil that you get a sense of what
the area was like centuries ago when the ancestral Puebloans settled here.
South of the reservation, the spectacular Salt River Canyon is the hub for white-water
rafters in spring, snow-melt permitting. Most other outdoor activities in the White
Mountains center on Pinetop-Lakeside, which also has the most dining and lodging
options. Tiny, woodsy Greer offers fewer activities — but many consider that the
town’s prime asset.
Farther east, on the approach to New Mexico, the landscape shifts. The scrubby, high-
elevation volcanic fields you will encounter near Springerville were settled by ances-
tors of the Hopi and Zuni, who created Casa Malpais’s unusual fissure pueblos.
Adventurous drivers like to head south on the scenic Coronado Trail, 123 miles of pine
forest and 15-mph switchbacks.
For additional information on what to do and where to stay in the White Mountains, see
www.whitemountainsguide.com, with links to the individual communities in the
region.

and you miss Jerome, but you may avoid white-knuckle anxiety if you go
this route.
Of the various shuttles that run from Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport to
Prescott, the Prescott Airport Shuttle (% 800-445-7978 or 928-445-5470;
www.prescotttransit.com) offers the most frequent scheduled serv-
ice. The cost is $28 each way, $49 round-trip. Prescott isn’t likely to be
your sole Arizona destination, however, so renting a car in Phoenix may
make more sense than taking the shuttle.
Greyhound, 820 E. Sheldon (% 800-231-2222 or 928-774-4573), runs
buses to Prescott.
When Highways 69 and 89 enter town, they merge into Gurley Street,
Prescott’s main thoroughfare. Gurley meets Montezuma and Cortez in
the town’s center; add Goodwin Street, which runs parallel to Gurley,
and you have Courthouse Plaza. Almost all the action in Prescott takes
place on or near this large, eminently strollable town square.
Spending the night
If you like your rooms touched with a bit of history, you’ll be in heaven
here, whether you choose to stay in Arizona’s first car-friendly hotel or
get pleasantly spooked by a resident ghost in an old inn. And you won’t
pay an arm and a leg for the privilege, either. Don’t give a hoot about
haunts or the past? Prescott’s got plenty of up-to-date lodgings, includ-
ing one with a casino.
Modest motels, several with classic 1950s kitsch appeal, line Highway 69
and, as you get closer to town, its Gurley Street continuation. Cruise this
route if you’re not looking for anything special or don’t feel like planning
ahead. Chains represented in town include Best Western, Comfort Inn,
Days Inn, Holiday Inn Express, Quality Inn & Suites, and Super 8 (see
the Appendix for the toll-free numbers). The chain most convenient to
the center of town is SpringHill Suites by Marriott ($$) 200 E. Sheldon
St. (% 888-287-9400 or 928-776-0998; www.travelsouthwest.com/
prescott), which also has excellent facilities. Check also with the

High and hilly (gasp!)
Not only does Prescott sit at 5,347 feet, but the town itself is subtly hilly. Don’t worry if
you find yourself breathing heavily on your return to your hotel, when heading out
seemed like a breeze — you may have just hit an upslope. Take it easy if you arrive
directly from sea level.

Hassayampa Inn
$$
Prescott
Prescott’s premier historic hotel, the Hassayampa Inn first introduced
porte cocheres to the state in 1929. It has a great Western Art Deco lobby
and attractive rooms to match. This hotel is also a good deal: A generous
order-from-the-menu breakfast at one of the town’s best restaurants, the
Peacock Room, is included in the rate (see the following “Dining locally”
section) and several packages bring costs down even more. Not all the
accommodations are large, and some get traffic noise from the main
square (request a room in the back), but these are minor tradeoffs when
you consider the character and the prime location.

Hotel St. Michael

Prescott
These Whiskey Row digs, around since 1900, have always been a great
base for a bar crawl (and, these days, a shopping spree). Room rates,
which are low to begin with, include a cooked-to-order breakfast at the
good, lobby-level Caffe St. Michael. But if you need quiet to sleep off your
hangover, you’re not going to get it here. And lodging is more funky than
functional — though the basic rooms are well maintained, don’t expect
extras like high-speed Internet.

Hotel Vendome
$$
Prescott
A cross between a hotel and a B&B, the Vendome has the privacy of the
former and the character of the latter (including a ghost). The hotel’s wine
bar, its convenience to Courthouse Plaza — but with enough distance to
avoid night noise — and a cheerful veranda on each floor are other pluses.
This pleasant place was built in 1917 but extensively revamped in the mid-
1990s.

Dining locally
Prescott always had a nice, college-casual dining scene, thanks to the
presence of Prescott College, Yavapai Community College, and Embry-
Riddle Aeronautical University in this area. Lately, however, the number
of places designed to satisfy sophisticated professorial and postgraduate
palates has increased, and Prescott has become somewhat of a foodie
destination. Most of the top choices are on or near Courthouse Plaza.
If you’re up for a romantic dinner in a formal atmosphere, consider, too,
the Peacock Room ($$$) at the Hassaymampa Inn (see the preceding
“Spending the night” section). On the opposite end of the spectrum, the
Palace ($–$$; see the “Living it up after dark” section) serves good food
along with its brews. You get historic settings as a bonus at both. The
Rose ($$$–$$$$), another upscale romantic favorite, had just gotten a
new chef as we went to press, and the reviews were not in yet. Ask
around when you get to town.

owners’ former inn in Burgundy, France, have been transported to the Granite Dells,

decorated rooms feature beautiful antiques and artwork. Plush robes, fresh flowers,
TV/VCR, and private entrances — and in two cases, a private deck with a spa —

Bustling and offering plenty of kid-friendly food, this spot also attracts

There’s something cruel about a place that tosses terrific salads — chicken,
grapes, sweet-spicy pecans, and blue cheese on baby greens, say — and
also displays the pastry creations of a chef from Provence. That is, you tell
yourself you’re coming in for a light bite and, next thing you know, you’ve
got a raspberry mousse mustache. Never mind. This sweetie’s pastries are
worth it. The sandwiches in this intimate place, such as chicken curry or
steak with whole-grain mustard, are wonderful, too. For a real treat — and
bargain — book dinner here on Saturday night: It’s $40 for four courses (the

Exploring Prescott
You’re likely to spend much of your time in Prescott on Courthouse
Plaza, the downtown square bounded by Goodwin and Gurley streets 
to the north and Montezuma and Cortez streets to the east and west,
respectively. Two of the town’s most popular activities, shopping and
bar-hopping (see the “Shopping for local treasures” and the “Living it up
after dark” sections later in this chapter), dovetail on Montezuma Street,
the town’s historic Whiskey Row. History and Western-art fans have a few
other options.
 Step back in time. If you want to explore the city’s many beautifully
restored Queen Anne–style houses (some 525 buildings are listed on
the National Register of Historic Places), take Goodwin Street east of
Courthouse Plaza to Mount Vernon Street and stroll north. The 3
blocks between Goodwin and Sheldon streets brim with turrets,
shingles, and gingerbread trim. For some more rough-hewn historic
sites, see the hiking suggestions in the “Staying active” section.
 Find Old West artifacts in a museum. I’ve spent hours poking
around the Sharlot Hall Museum, 415 W. Gurley St., 2 blocks west
of Courthouse Plaza (% 928-445-3122; www.sharlot.org), a com-
plex of buildings and gardens named for protofeminist, poet, and

Great Scott! (not)
Named for William Hickling Prescott, an East Coast historian, Prescott is pronounced
presk-it, the second syllable rhyming with “biscuit.” Why? According to local histo-
rian Melissa Ruffner, Prescott came from Boston, which was big on renouncing its
colonial English roots — pronunciations included. Whatever the derivation, if you pro-
nounce the “scott,” you’re announcing loud and clear that you’re an out-of-towner.

historian Sharlot Hall. Its centerpiece is the rustic pine cabin that
served as the first territorial governor’s mansion, but 15 other sta-
tions lead you through Prescott’s past. Displays include everything
from a mummified mouse, found during the mansion’s excavation,
to a small Wells Fargo stagecoach that squeezed some 31 people 
in with its bundles of mail. Admission is $5 per adult over 18. It’s
open May to September Monday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and
Sunday noon to 4 p.m., October through April Monday to Saturday
10 a.m. to 4 p.m., and Sunday noon to 4 p.m.
 Research the region’s Native American past. The architecturally
striking Smoki Museum, 147 N. Arizona St., about three quarters of
a mile east of Courthouse Plaza via Gurley Street (% 928-445-1230;
www.smokimuseum.org), was built in 1935 out of native stone and
wood in the shape of a pueblo. Some rare Native American pots
and baskets from the region are on permanent display, and rotating
exhibits are always interesting. Admission is $4 for adults, $3 sen-
iors, $2 students, and children ages 12 and under are free. Hours
are Monday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Sunday 1 to 4 p.m.
 Get artsy. Fans of Western art enjoy the small Phippen Museum,
4701 Hwy. 89, about 7 miles north of downtown (% 928-778-1385;
www.phippenartmuseum.org), perched on a hill near the Granite
Dells. The work (including that of George Phippen, a member of the
Cowboy Artists of America) tends toward the traditional and repre-
sentational, but even those with more contemporary tastes are
likely to appreciate these high-quality shows. Admission is $5 for
adults, $4 for seniors and students, and children ages 11 and under
are free. Hours are Tuesday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and
Sunday 1 to 4 p.m.
Guided tours
Melissa Ruffner takes her Prescott Historical Tours (% 928-445-4567)
very personally — she’s descended from some of the town’s pioneers.
Ruffner’s excursions through the town’s past, done in Territorial-era 
costume, cost $10 per person if a minimum of ten people signs on. Two
people can book a $40 tour package that includes an autographed copy
of Ruffner’s Prescott: A Pictorial History.
If you want to find out about the area’s history — natural as well as
human — at your own pace, pick up a copy of the Yavapai Heritage
Foundation’s excellent “Forests and Grasslands” self-guided driving
tours, available at the Sharlot Hall Museum (see the preceding section)
or at the Chamber of Commerce (see the “Fast Facts: Prescott” section
later in this chapter). The tabloid format publication (cost: $5) has four
itineraries (The Bradshaw Mountains, Walnut Grove, Williamson Valley,
and Limestone Canyon) and includes everything from road conditions to
a suggested reading list. All tours start out at Courthouse Plaza.
Chapter 16: Central Arizona 329

Staying active
Want to spend your time here outdoors? Prescott offers lots of options
for fresh-air enthusiasts.
 Golfing: Prescott always ranks high in the surveys of America’s best
retirement towns, which may explain why it’s getting to be a duffer’s
destination. The greens fees noted here are for high season — prices
are often considerably lower from October through March or 
April — and unless otherwise indicated they include a cart.
It’s hard to beat the prices at Quailwood Greens Golf Course,
11750 E. Hwy. 69 in Dewey, 14 miles east of downtown Prescott 
(% 928-772-0130). At this par-70 public course, you pay $32 in the
morning, $20 after noon. The city-owned Antelope Hills, 1 Perkins
Dr., 7 miles east of downtown near where Highways 69 and 89 split
(% 928-776-7888 or 800-972-6818 in Arizona; www.antelopehills
golf.com), has panoramic views of the Granite Dells and the
Mogollon Rim on its two 18-hole courses (one is a Gary Panks’ 
creation). Greens fees are $55. A dramatic Bradshaw Mountain
backdrop makes the 18-hole Prescott Golf & Country Club, 1030
Prescott Country Club Blvd., 13 miles southeast of Prescott off
Highway 69 (% 800-717-7274; www.prescottgolf.net), a duffer’s
dream. Greens fees for nonmembers are $45 weekday mornings,
with rates going down after noon and again after 3p.m.; add about
$5 more Friday through Sunday. The newest on the greens scene,
Stone Ridge, 1602 North Bluff Top Rd., 5 miles southeast of down-
town Prescott (% 928-772-6500; www.stoneridgegolf.com), was
designed by Randy Heckenkemper to take advantage of the area’s
ups and downs — and natural beauty — while appealing to all
levels of expertise. Greens fees on this public course are $57 during
the week, $70 on weekends, lowering to $35 after 2 p.m. on week-
days, $49 on weekends.
Come summer, several hotels run “Stay and Play” packages, which
throw in a golf game for two with the price of a room.
 Hiking: Some 450 miles of trails, covering a wide range of land-
scapes, crisscross Prescott National Forest. The 13⁄4 mile (round-
trip) hike up to Thumb Butte, Prescott’s best-known landmark, is
fairly steep, but you’re rewarded with spectacular vistas of the
entire region, including (on clear days) the San Francisco Peaks.
Reaching two historic sites in the piney Lynx Lake area is easier:
the Lynx Creek Indian ruins, where you can wander among the
remains of a prehistoric Indian pueblo; and Charcoal Kiln, a large
brick dome used to create charcoal from wood in the 1800s. The
dramatic boulders of the Granite Dells near Watson Lake Park
attract rock climbers as well as hikers.
The Bradshaw Ranger District of the Prescott National Forest, 344
S. Cortez St. (% 928-443-8000; www.fs.fed.us/r3/prescott), is
the best place to get information on these and other trails. The
office is only open Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.,
Part IV: Exploring the Regions 
330

so if you want to hike on the weekend, plan ahead. You may also
stop in at the Chamber of Commerce (see the “Fast Facts: Prescott”
section later in this chapter) for information on the less compli-
cated hikes.
 Horseback riding: The guided rides given by Granite Mountain
Stables, 2400 W. Shane Dr., some 7 miles northeast of Prescott 
(% 928-771-9551; www.granitemountainstables.com), start at
$35 an hour.
 Mountain biking: Prescott’s varied terrain lets fat-tire enthusiasts
choose their level of ride. If you’re a beginner, you may like a flat
route with views of Granite Mountain such as the Peavine Trail,
converted from an old rail line; if you’re more advanced, you
should enjoy the up-and-down adventures offered by the Granite
Basin Recreation Area near Watson Lake. Ironclad Bicycles, 710
White Spar Rd. (% 928-776-1755; www.ironcladbicycles.com),
rents standard front suspension ($10 per hour, $30 for a full day)
and high-end dual suspension ($15 per hour, $50 per day) mountain
bikes, and can provide maps for six different routes.
Shopping for local treasures
Prescott’s many antiques shops sell everything from top-notch Victorian
cabinets to cowboy-kitsch pitchers, and at pretty good prices — one
reason that Phoenicians like to weekend here. Of course, if you fly into
Arizona, the shipping costs on large pieces may wipe out any savings,
but who knows? You may find something portable — or actually worth
the shipping expense. Antique shops are all around town, but the best
pickings are on Cortez Street, just north of Courthouse Plaza between
Gurley and Sheldon. Ask at the Chamber of Commerce (see the “Fast
Facts: Prescott” section later in this chapter) for the “Antiques Shops
Guide” pamphlet.
Crafts and Western knickknack shops line Courthouse Plaza, particularly
Montezuma and Gurley streets. You can concentrate your retail search in
two good arcades, Bashford Courts, 130 W. Gurley St., and St. Michael’s
Plaza, 205 W. Gurley St. Three galleries on Montezuma Street are good
resources for local, generally contemporary crafts: Arts Prescott Gallery,
134 S. Montezuma St. (% 928-776-7717), a high-quality co-op; Newman
Gallery, 106A S. Montezuma St. (% 928-442-9167), showcasing the fun,
funky creations of Dave Newman and friends; and Van Gogh’s Ear, 156B
S. Montezuma St. (% 928-776-1080), with everything from sculpture to
wearable art, such as cheerful shoes featuring brightly painted designs
and scenes. Just a couple of blocks from the plaza, Prescott Fine Arts
Gallery, 208 N. Marina St. (% 928-445-3286), also offers high-quality
local art at good prices. If you don’t like the genre that’s being featured
during your visit, the gift shop has plenty more art to choose from. The
gift shop of the Smoki Museum (see the “Exploring Prescott” section) is a
good hunting ground for Native American arts and crafts.

Living it up after dark
Not as exciting as it once was in the early 1900s, when some 20 saloons
and brothels lined Whiskey Row (Montezuma St.), Prescott’s nightlife still
thrives, thanks in part to the town’s many higher drinking (er, learning)
institutions. The ornate mahogany bar at the Palace, 120 S. Montezuma St.
(% 928-541-1996) (see the “They had their priorities straight . . . “ sidebar
in this section), is a huge tourist magnet. Just upstairs from the Palace,
Jersey Lilly, 116 S. Montezuma St. (% 928-541-7854), offers a somewhat
more refined atmosphere and good views of Courthouse Square from on
high. Matt’s Longhorn Saloon, 112 S. Montezuma St. (% 928-778-9914),
lays on live Country and Western sounds. A block north of Courthouse
Plaza, Lyzzard’s Lounge, 120 N. Cortez St. (% 928-778-2244), books good
alternative bands. Drop by to see the bar, manufactured in the 1880s in
Chicago, shipped down the Mississippi and around Cape Horn to San
Francisco, and transported to Prescott by covered wagon.
The lounges at the Hassayampa Inn and the Prescott Resort (see the
“Spending the night” section earlier in this chapter for both) tend to 
feature mellower sounds, as does 1291⁄2, an “American Jazz Grille” (see
“Dining locally,” earlier in this chapter). Sax fiends may also call the
Prescott Jazz Society (% 928-925-1422; www.pjazz.org) for informa-
tion on its members’ performances. Find out what’s happening at all
kinds of venues in town by checking out The Daily Courier (www.daily
courier.com) on Thursday and Friday.
Fast Facts: Prescott
They had their priorities straight 
(but not sober)
On July 14, 1900, when a fire engulfed Whiskey Row, its resident souses roused them-
selves to haul the 24-foot-long, 12-foot-high mahogany bar from the Palace Bar across
the road to the relative safety of Courthouse Plaza. Then they continued to drink at the
bar while watching the rest of the block go up in flames.

Chapter 16: Central Arizona 333
No bridge too far
No, it’s not the punch line of a joke involving waterfront property in Arizona or being
gullible enough to buy the Brooklyn Bridge: The London Bridge really was transported,
piece by piece, from England to Lake Havasu City, a desert town near Arizona’s border
with California. (The lake is an import, too, created when Parker Dam was built in 1938.)
Come summer, Lake Havasu often turns up on the News at 10 for having the country’s
high mercury peak, but it’s pleasant enough in winter, spring — except when the col-
lege-break hordes descend — and fall. The town is a popular stop on the southern 
(I-10 to I-95) route from Arizona to Las Vegas, although it’s really not a convenient
daytrip from anywhere covered in this book. If you take Highway 60 west from
Wickenburg to Highway 95 North, you’ll get there in about three hours.
Activities mostly center on the bridge (gaping at it, browsing the souvenir shops that
line the waterfront) and Lake Havasu (boating, fishing, parasailing, kayaking . . . you
name it). In keeping with the faux-water-attractions theme, the latest tourist draw is
a series of lighthouses, each a reduced scale replica of one from the eastern U.S.
Chain hotels abound, as do Ye Olde England–themed lodgings; for something entirely
different, try the Agave Inn ($$–$$$),1420 McCulloch Blvd. N. (% 866-854-2833 or 928-
854-2833; www.agaveinn.com), a hip boutique hotel on the waterfront (there was
even a Brangelina sighting here in 2005).
For more information about what to see and where to stay and eat, contact the Lake
Havasu Visitor and Convention Bureau (% 800-2-HAVASU; www.golakehavasu.
com).
But Lake Havasu isn’t the only splashy Colorado River town on Arizona’s West Coast.
The 16-mile-long Parker Strip — sharing a name with the dam on its northern end and
the tiny former mining town that serves as the La Paz County seat — is a watersports
mecca. In fact, one of the Parker Strip’s claims to fame is that both the Jet Ski and Air
Chair were invented here. Another is that much of its land belongs to the Colorado
River Indian Tribes (CRIT), a unique union of the Mohave, Chemehuevi, Navajo, and
Hopi. They do own a casino on the Colorado River, but much of their riverfront prop-
erty is pristine.
Among the areas distinguishing features are restaurants with floating bars, posh
neighborhoods reached via Venice-like canals, and the spectacular Emerald Canyon
Golf Course, including one cliffside tee. And nature lovers enjoy the nearby Bill
Williams National Wildlife Refuge and Buckskin Mountain State Park.

 Exploring the Greatest Hole on Earth, Part II: The Grand Canyon’s North Rim
T
he Grand Canyon may be the most celebrated natural attraction in
the United States. And with good reason: Gazing (or better yet, walk-
ing) into the famous abyss is an unforgettable experience. You won’t be
the only one wanting to enjoy the canyon, however; so it’s a good idea to
plan your trip with care. I can’t do your packing, but I can help with just
about everything else. And — more good news — the rest of northwest
Arizona doesn’t just exist to deliver tourists into the vast maws of the
canyon god. This part of the state offers plenty of other interesting (and
less crowded) activities, especially in and around Flagstaff, northern
Arizona’s largest town.
The length of your stay in this area depends on the part of the canyon
you visit and what you want to do. If, like most visitors, you just straddle
the edge of the South Rim, a full day at the national park is enough. If,
however, you dip in — say, by hiking, river rafting, or mule riding (and 
I definitely recommend that you do) — plan on at least two days; add
another two to do the rest of the region justice. The more remote North
Rim, a destination rather than a drop-in, requires more of a time commit-
ment. No matter what you do when you get there, you need to allot at
least a day of traveling each way.
Where you bunk also depends on your touring style. If you like to be
close to the action or want to explore the park early in the morning
before the tourists descend, by all means spend a night or two in the
national park or as close to it as possible (that’s more of a given if you’re
going to the North Rim). I like staying in Flagstaff when I visit the South
Rim, if I’m not planning any major hikes. The one-hour drive to the
canyon is easy, and the town has many more places to stay, eat, and play
after dark. And Flagstaff makes a great base for travel to other places,

including central Arizona (see Chapter 16) and northeastern Arizona
(see Chapter 18).

A pretty, piney region financed by lumber and railways before the Grand
Canyon became a growth industry, lower northwest Arizona has a lot
going for it. The San Francisco Peaks, the state’s highest mountains, were
uplifted by a not-so-ancient volcano, which also left behind soil so fertile
that several Indian civilizations came to this area — the proof is in Walnut
Canyon and Wupatki National monuments. Route 66, which helped speed
tourists toward the abyss, left a legacy of cool neon signs, while the estab-
lishment of Northern Arizona University gave Flagstaff a youth boost.
Snowbowl, on one of the San Francisco Peaks, boasts the best skiing in 
the state — although I admit, that’s not saying all that much.
You may initially think that Flagstaff never met a hotel or restaurant
chain it didn’t like. Don’t be put off by first impressions. Behind all the
fast-food restaurants and hotel strips sits a friendly, alpine (altitude:
6,902 ft.) college town with the best nightlife in the area (okay, so maybe
that’s not saying a whole lot, either). Inexpensive hotel rooms, abundant
restaurants, and a central location make Flagstaff a great base for visit-
ing the Grand Canyon and other area attractions, but the city itself also
deserves some attention — at least a day. Devote another one to Walnut
Canyon, en route to the Petrified Forest National Park (see Chapter 18)
or Sunset Crater and Wupatki, if you can. Woodsy Williams is even closer
to the Grand Canyon, but slightly farther from the other sights. (You can
pretty much cover that town in a morning or afternoon.) If you ride the
Grand Canyon rails or want to stay in a cozy, small town, Williams is a
good place to plant yourself for a bit.
Getting there
If you’re like most people who come to Arizona, you fly into Phoenix and
rent a car at Sky Harbor International Airport (see Chapter 11). Flagstaff
is 134 miles from Phoenix via I-17, a divided four-lane highway, some-
what curvy in spots, with a speed limit of mostly 75 mph. I-40, the main
east-west road through Flagstaff, Williams (30 miles west), and northern
Arizona, is about as fast and flat as they come.
Open Road Tours (% 800-766-7117; www.openroadtours.com) runs
five shuttle buses a day from Phoenix’s Sky Harbor Airport to Flagstaff’s
Amtrak station (which doubles as the visitor center). The price is $42
one-way or $76 round-trip for adults, and $30/$52 for children 11 and
under with an adult.

The Grand Canyon and Northern Arizona
Chapter 17: The Grand Canyon and Northwest Arizona 337

You can fly from Phoenix to Flagstaff via USAirways (% 800-235-9292),
which has frequent nonstops daily into Flagstaff Pulliam Airport (% 928-
556-1234), 3 miles south of town (I-17 Exit 337). Unless you catch a spe-
cial, however, these short hops tend to be pricey, and unless you arrive
before 2 p.m. (when the flights are most frequent), you may not save
much time. Alamo, Avis, Budget, Hertz, and National car-rental agencies
are available at Flagstaff’s airport.
Amtrak, 1 E. Route 66 (% 800-872-7245 or 928-774-8679; www.amtrak.
com), whistles into Flagstaff twice a day. Arrive this way and you get a
jump on the other tourists: The restored train depot doubles as the
information center. Amtrak also offers daily service into Williams, where
you can tootle off to the Grand Canyon. The train stops at an unstaffed
station about 3 miles outside town, but connecting bus service is pro-
vided. Call Amtrak for information about Amtrak/Grand Canyon Railway
(see the “Riding the Grand Canyon rails” sidebar later in this chapter)
packages.
Greyhound (% 800-231-2222) has plenty of connections into the Flagstaff
station, 399 S. Malpais Lane (% 928-774-4573). Note: Williams is no longer
serviced by Greyhound.
For ways to reach Havasu Canyon, see the “Exploring lower northwest
Arizona” section in this chapter.
Getting around
I-40 is the main east-west thoroughfare across this part of the state. To
head north, take Highway 89A or Highway 180 from Flagstaff, or Highway
64 from Williams.
In Flagstaff
I-17 and Highway 89A merge south of Flagstaff and, heading north, turn
into Milton Road, Humphreys Road, and Fort Valley Road (also known as
Highway 180), which leads to the Grand Canyon. Business Route 40, which
parallels I-40 and runs east-west, reverts to its old name, Route 66, for a
while in town but also does a brief stint through the town center under
the alias Santa Fe Avenue. Leroux Street, in the heart of downtown — the
roughly 4-square-block area surrounding the old railroad depot at Old
Route 66 and Beaver Street — marks the divide between the east and west
sides of town. When locals refer to the east side, however, they generally
mean the section beyond Fourth Street. Northern Arizona University,
which you pass if you come in on I-17, is on Flagstaff’s south side.
Because of name changes and lack of a grid, Flagstaff’s streets can 
be really confusing. Unless you stop at a gas station, asking for direc-
tions won’t generally do you much good because half the people you
encounter are also from out of town. Pick up a good map at the visitor
center or from your hotel’s front desk (call your hotel for directions if
finding your destination becomes difficult).

Mountain Line (% 928-779-6624; www.coconino.az.gov/mountain
line.aspx?id=221), Flagstaff’s public transportation system, is fine for
getting you around town during the week (fare: $1) if you have time —
most of the lines have hourly stops only — but service is abbreviated on
Saturday and nonexistent on Sunday.
In Williams
Williams’s main streets are Railroad Avenue and Bill Williams Avenue/
Route 66, which run one-way through town before merging at both ends
into historic Route 66. The town doesn’t have public transportation, but
the sights are within walking distance of most hotels.
Spending the night
This area has every kind of place to bunk — resort-type motels, historic
hotels, interesting B&Bs, and lodges — except full-scale luxury resorts
(head south to Sedona for more upscale lodgings; see Chapter 16 for
details). A glut of rooms means you can pick and choose and get some
real bargains to boot during the off season. The closer you get to summer,
when the hordes descend on the Grand Canyon, the more difficult rooms
are to find and the more you have to pay for them. Spring Break is also a
busy time, in Williams as well as in Flagstaff. If your heart is set on a par-
ticular place, chain hotels included, book as far in advance as possible.
Note: On winter nights when the Grand Canyon Railway runs its special
Starlight Express (see the “Riding the Grand Canyon rails” sidebar later
in this chapter), expect to find many rooms sold out in Williams.
In Flagstaff, you won’t have any trouble locating a link — often two or
three — in your favorite hotel chain. In Williams, the chain options
include Best Western, Day’s Inn, EconoLodge, Fairfield Inn by
Marriott, Holiday Inn, Howard Johnson Express, Motel 6, Quality 
Inn, Rodeway Inn, Super 8, and Travelodge. See the Appendix for the
chains’ toll-free numbers.
Flagstaff
In addition to the lodgings listed here, I also like Hotel Monte Vista
($–$$), 100 N. San Francisco St. (% 800-545-3068 or 928-779-6971;
www.hotelmontevista.com), a historic 1926 hotel that’s grown a tad
shabby but is inexpensive and in the heart of downtown; and Starlight
Pines B&B, 3380 E. Lockett Rd. (% 800-752-1912 or 928-527-1912;
www.starlightpinesbb.com), with lots of Tiffany touches through-
out. Although new, it has a historic aura. I’ve heard the new owners of
Arizona Moonlit Lodge ($$), 10155 Mountainaire Rd. (% 800-754-0664
or 928-525-6212; www.sleddoginn.com), which used to be the Arizona
Sled Dog Inn, are doing nice things with their rustic and elegant place,
south of town, and that they’ve got a new assortment of critters to
replace the departing pack of huskies.

Comfi Cottages
$$
Near Downtown
Great for a family or group of friends traveling together, these eight rental
cottages near downtown Flagstaff give you that warm, homey feeling in
addition to privacy. All are country cute but with modern facilities. Even
if you’re not big on antiques or frills, you appreciate the fully equipped
(and stocked for breakfast) kitchens, cable TVs, picnic tables, and back-
yard barbecues. The word “cottages” is a bit misleading, because these
units, especially the one with four bedrooms, are more spacious than that
term implies. They’re all definitely “comfi,” though.
1612 N. Aztec (reservations office). % 888-774-0731 or 928-774-0731. Fax: 928-773-
7286. www.comficottages.com. Rack rates: $140–$260 for two people, depend-
ing on the size of the house, plus $10 for each additional person (larger houses avail-
able for up to eight people). DISC, MC, V.
England House Bed & Breakfast
$$–$$$
Downtown
Ideal for those who like both aesthetics and athletics, this beautifully
restored 1902 house offers lovely antique-filled rooms, fine linens, fluffy
robes — the whole nine yards — but you never feel like you’re sleeping in
a museum as you do in some B&Bs. You’re encouraged to come down to
the kitchen for a midnight snack, and to chat with the friendly owners
while they prepare your gourmet breakfast, served on a sunny enclosed
porch or outdoor deck. The athletics? You’re only a few blocks from a very
strollable downtown, and, if you head the other way, you’ll hit Mars Hill, a
scenic rise that’ll get your heart pumping.
614 W. Santa Fe Ave. at N. Bonito. % 877-214-7350 or 928-214-7350, www.england
housebandb.com. Rack rates: $115–$195 double. Tues discount for extended stay
in winter. Rates include full breakfast. DISC, MC, V.
The Inn at 410 Bed and Breakfast
$$–$$$
Downtown
This former banker’s house in the heart of downtown, built in 1907, carries
the chosen theme of each of its nine rooms down to the last detail — a
hand-painted French Impressionist screen in the Monet’s Garden room,
say, or clean-lined Craftsman pieces reminiscent of historic lodges in the
Canyon Memories room. The lovely decor, plus such details as whirlpool
tubs and/or fireplaces in several units — not to mention the garden with
a gazebo — make this inn a great romantic getaway. Rooms come equipped
with TVs and DVD players, too.

and on major holidays. Rates include full breakfast. MC, V.

The Inn at NAU
$
South side
Northern Arizona University has one of the best hotel- and restaurant-man-
agement training programs in the country. Stay at this on-campus inn —
formerly the university president’s home — and be part of the guinea pig,
er, educational, process. The large, well-designed rooms (two available for
those with allergies or environmental sensitivities) come equipped with
all the goods: hair dryers, refrigerators, coffeemakers, large desks, and
safes. And such a deal when it comes to meals — not only is breakfast free,
but the six-course gourmet dinners served Friday nights at the Garden
Terrace dining room cost just $29.95. Don’t worry, the students are care-
fully supervised and graded on how well they treat you.

$79–$84 double (rates may be higher in Dec, and the hotel may be closed for the uni-
versity’s winter break). No taxes apply and rates include breakfast. AE, MC, V.
Little America Flagstaff
$$
Eastside
This is my all-time favorite motel for many reasons, including its large,
nicely decorated rooms; its sports lounge with a rare Tiffany glass tree and
adjoining retro-swank dining room that locals flock to for Sunday brunch;
its 24-hour deli; great gift shop; laundry room; 2-mile hiking trail, exercise
room, pool, outdoor spa . . . even a gas station. Guest quarters all offer
large-screen TVs, refrigerators, coffeemakers, and high-speed Internet
access. This outpost of a small western chain is right near I-40 but
shrouded in a 500-acre Ponderosa pine forest, so it mixes travel conven-
ience with woodsy atmosphere.
2515 E. Butler Ave. (at I-40 Exit 198). % 800-865-1401 or 928-779-7900. Fax: 928-779-

holidays $139–$169 double; Nov–Apr $99–$139 double. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V.
Radisson Woodlands Hotel Flagstaff
$–$$$
Westside
This is the closest thing Flagstaff has to a fancy hotel, what with its Euro-
chic lobby, good Japanese restaurant, and such facilities as a sauna,
heated pool, and whirlpool. It’s also one of the few places in town with
business perks like room service, valet service, and complimentary air-
port transfers. And the recently redone rooms come equipped with the
chain’s adjustable Sleep Number Beds. But the good news is that you won’t
pay fancy hotel prices — or suffer from the snooty attitude that sometimes
comes with upscale properties.

Snowbowl Skilift Lodge
$–$$
North of Flagstaff
Flagstaff’s last call for lodging en route to the Grand Canyon via Highway
180. Located at the foot of the Snowbowl ski resort, near the Flagstaff
Nordic Center, the lodge has nothing but miles of undeveloped land to its
north. Originally part of a 1930s Western set, dismantled and trucked here
from Sedona, this motel (sorry — surrounding trees do not a lodge make)
has rooms with gas-burning log stoves, pine walls, and little front porches.
All rooms are equipped with TVs, but no phones (two are on the premises).
6355 Hwy. 180 (7 miles north of Flagstaff). % 800/472-3599 (in AZ and CA) or 928/774-
0729. www.arizonasnowbowl.com. Rack rates: Memorial Day–Labor Day
Sun–Thurs $59 double, $85 Mon–Thurs package that includes breakfast, skyride, and
dinner discounts for two, $119 for the same package; Fri–Sat. Rates higher in winter:
Sun-Thurs $79 double, $99 Fri–Sat if the ski resort is open; $59/$79 if resort is closed;
downhill and cross-country ski packages available, snow permitting. AE, DC, DISC,
MC, V.
Williams
In addition to the lodgings listed in this section, if you’re traveling with
kids, you may also consider the caboose rooms in the Canyon Motel &
Railroad RV Park ($–$$), 1900 Rodeo Rd. (% 800-482-3955 or 520-635-
9371; www.railroadrv.com). The decor is nothing special, and the
quarters are cramped, but how many chances do you get to sleep in a
railroad car that doesn’t move? Like the RV park, Drover’s Hotel ($$), 321
Route 66 (% 928-635-4512; www.wildwestjunction.com), is a work in
progress, with a group of motel rooms being refurbished to fit in with the
small Western museum, saloon-style restaurant, and Wild West–themed
complex in various stages of completion.
Grand Canyon Railway Hotel
$$
Williams
A 1990s tribute to the original 1908 Williams depot, this hotel is part of the
Grand Canyon Railway complex, which includes a gift shop, Max &
Thelma’s restaurant (okay, but nothing special), Spenser’s bar/casual
eatery, an indoor pool, exercise room, and hot tub. The Southwest con-
temporary–style rooms don’t have as much character as the grand public
areas, but they’re perfectly pleasant and comfortable. This place is perfect
as part of a train package, but no great bargain if you’re not riding the rails.

Grand Living Bed & Breakfast
$$
Williams
Built expressly as a B&B, Grand Living is your basic Victorian inn — except
that it’s a two-story log structure. The four airy rooms are anything but
rustic, with claw-foot tubs/showers or jetted tubs and high-quality antiques.
All rooms have fireplaces and access to a wraparound veranda — plus
TV/VCRs and wireless Internet, if you get bored of bonding with each other.
The huge gourmet breakfasts are a bonus, as is the helpfulness of the
owners — though private entrances for each room mean you don’t have to
bond with them, either.

Dining locally
Students, as much as tourists, drive the dining scene in Flagstaff. Fast
food rules, but a few gourmet options and plenty of good ethnic and
down-home restaurants exist, too. (You didn’t really come here to dress
up for dinner, did you?) As you may expect, smaller Williams offers pro-
portionately fewer places to refuel, none upscale.
Flagstaff
In addition to the top picks listed here, I also like Pasto’s ($$–$$$), 503 N.
Humphreys (% 928-779-3400), an intimate Italian trattoria that would be
more romantic if the dishes weren’t so garlic heavy; Stromboli ($–$$),
1435 S. Milton (% 928-773-1960), a low-key, family-friendly spot with
good pizzas and calzones; Bigfoot Bar-B-Que ($), at Leroux and Birch in
the Old Town Shops complex (% 928-226-1677), offering ribs, catfish,
hot dogs, even veggies — anything that can be grilled, spiced, or fried;
and Cafe Ole ($–$$), 119 S. San Francisco St. (% 928-774-8271), serving
family-recipe Mexican food with a flair.

The best little whorehouse in Arizona
A former bordello that served railroad roughs and their pals, the Red Garter, 137
Railroad Ave. (% 800-328-1484 or 928-635-1484; www.redgarter.com), now caters
to the (theoretically) more respectable B&B crowd. Owner/innkeeper John Holst is
happy to talk about his terrific restoration of the house — he kept the original graffiti
in one of the “girls’” rooms, for example, but added private baths. You have to walk up
a flight of stairs to get to your room, but the exercise is good for you because the free
continental breakfast includes your pick of pastries made in the connecting bakery.
Rack rates: $120–$145 double (discounts available for Internet, last-minute, and Nov
and Feb bookings). DISC, MC, V.

Beaver St. Brewery
$–$$
Downtown
AMERICAN/BREW PUB
The sprawling, ever-popular Beaver Street Brewery isn’t just hopping
because of its hops. Creative salads, wood-fired designer pizzas, and
hearty burgers also draw the hungry hordes. The Bramble Berry beer gets
raves, but I prefer my fruit in a bowl and instead hail the Railhead Red Ale.
11 S. Beaver St. (at Cottage Street). % 928-779-0079. Reservations not accepted.
Individual pizzas, salad, sandwiches $7–$9. AE, DISC, MC, V. Daily lunch and dinner.
Cottage Place
$$$–$$$$
Between downtown and NAU
CONTINENTAL
A cozy, candlelit classic, Cottage Place offers good, if fairly traditional,
Continental fare, an award-winning wine list, and service that’s attentive
without being in your face. Rack of lamb and pork schnitzel are typical of
the specialties, but vegetarians are never ignored — or bored. Wine
Spectator magazine has given this restaurant an “Award of Excellence”
every year since 1996.
126 W. Cottage Ave. (at Humphries). % 928-774-8431. Reservations suggested in high
season, essential weekends. Main courses: $23–$32. AE, MC, V. Tues–Sun dinner.
Jackson’s Grill at the Springs
$$–$$$
En route to Sedona
NEW AMERICAN
It’s worth driving a bit south of town to get to this restaurant, which com-
bines good food with a semi-rural setting. The mussels in Dijon cream
make a good starter. For entrees, I’d recommend the prime rib for classi-
cists, the ahi tuna with sticky rice and fresh pineapple for the more adven-
turous. All personalities should enjoy the rustic elegant dining room or the
patio with a view of neighboring llamas. (Don’t worry. The llamas are too
far away for spitting.)
7055 S. Hwy. 89A. % 928-213-9332. Reservations recommended, especially week-
ends. Main courses: $18–$34. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V. Dinner nightly, Sunday buffet
brunch.
Josephine’s

Near Downtown
NEW AMERICAN
This modern American bistro in a pretty stone cottage offers some of the
most imaginative food in town. Dishes that may emerge from the open
kitchen include smoked salmon artichoke dip, tortilla encrusted halibut,
and Mediterranean lamb meat loaf. You won’t regret indulging in desserts
like the apple-cranberry crisp with an oatmeal crust and cinnamon ice
cream.
503 N. Humphreys (at Vine). % 928-779-3400. Reservations recommended, especially
weekends. Main courses: $17–$23. AE, DISC, MC, V. Mon–Sat lunch and dinner; Sun

Mountain Oasis
$–$$
Near Downtown
CONTINENTAL/VEGETARIAN
This brick-walled restaurant, cheery with potted plants and a large window
on one of downtown’s main streets, is quintessential Flagstaff — a little
hippy, a little sophisticated, a lot friendly. Good veggie selections, includ-
ing generous wraps and stir-fries, are on offer, but you don’t have to go
meatless here. International options at dinner range from coconut curry
salmon to New York strip. The cross generational appeal includes a sepa-
rate kids’ menu and a small but decent list of wines by the glass and beer.

Williams’ Mexican restaurant for “real people,” a few blocks off the beaten
tourist path, this place is short on atmosphere but long on menu choices.
Yes, it caters to gringos with items like burgers, fries, hot wings, but mostly
it focuses on generous Mexican combination plates. And a number of
Mexican sodas and soft drinks are available here, along with the usual mar-
garitas and cervezas.

Exploring Flagstaff, Williams, 
and lower northwest Arizona
You may be surprised by the many different — as in both varied and
strange — things you see around here, from volcanic fields to observato-
ries to mansions made of logs. Many of the attractions in this chapter

Bean there, done that
What’s a college town without coffeehouses? In addition to links in you-know-what
Seattle chain, Flag offers the following local favorites:
 Café Espress, 16 N. San Francisco St. at E. Aspen Avenue, downtown (% 928-
774-0541), is your quintessential collegiate-minded chow house: lots of tofu and
veggies, and elaborate espresso drinks made with organic, fair-trade, bird-friendly
coffee. The bakery turns out some tasty pastry, and the student-budget-geared
prices are pretty sweet, too.
 Campus Coffee Bean, 1800 S. Milton Rd., #24, in a strip shopping center near NAU
(% 928-556-0660), offers live music or poetry readings most nights. The menu
stretches beyond coffees, chais, and Italian sodas to include hot and cold sand-
wiches and sweets.
 Jitters, 3504 E. Route 66, at Fanning, eastside (% 928-526-6964), serves freshly
made soups, gourmet sandwiches, and a tempting array of cakes and pies. Great
selection of offbeat greeting cards, too.
 Late for the Train, 107 N. San Francisco St. at East Aspen Avenue, downtown 
(% 928-779-5975), features the requisite black-clad baristas with attitude prepar-
ing requisitely strong espresso. Possibly the hippest of the bunch. Also on 1800
N. Fort Valley Rd., west side (% 928-773-0308); 2080 S. Milton, #300, south side
(% 928-213-8500); and a kiosk in FMC Hospital, 1200 N. Beaver St., just north of
downtown (% 928-214-3943).
 Macy’s European Coffeehouse and Bakery, 14 S. Beaver St., just south of the rail-
road tracks/Santa Fe Avenue (% 928-774-2243), is far more Californian than
European (what self-respecting cafe on the Continent would serve veggie lasagna
with tempeh?) and hippie chic with its bright-red coffee roasters and infinite java
riffs.

involve being outdoors, but I put the activities primarily designed to
keep you moving — as opposed to activities where moving is just a nec-
essary adjunct — into the “Staying active” section. (You don’t even have
to look at that section if you feel lazy, honest.)
Flagstaff
Beyond its motel and fast-food-frenzied facade, Flagstaff has sights that
track back to its roots as a railroad and lumber center and to its Route
66 glory days. Stop in at the visitor center at the old Santa Fe depot (see
the “Fast Facts: Flagstaff, Williams, and Lower Northwest Arizona” sec-
tion in this chapter) to pick up a self-guided map of the many turn-of-
the-19th-century masonry buildings in the Downtown Historic Railroad
District, or, in summer, to find out about the free 90-minute walking tours
of downtown led by Richard and Sherry Mangum, two local historians
(call % 928-774-8800 for more information) Other sightseeing options
follow.
 Study the culture of the Plateau. The Museum of Northern
Arizona, 3101 N. Fort Valley Rd. (Highway 180 North, 3 miles north
of Flagstaff; % 928-774-5213; www.musnaz.org), which highlights
the arts, culture, and geology of Colorado Plateau, would be a
standout anywhere, but it’s a must-see if you’re in this area; the
1928 native stone building is worth the trip alone. Greatest hits of
the permanent collection include the Navajo and Hopi textile col-
lection and — a kiddie favorite — the life-size Dilophosaurus, a
dino carnivore that stomped this region when it was a swamp.
Rotating exhibits are consistently excellent. (Also check out the
“Shopping for local treasures” section in this chapter.) Admission is
$5 adults, $4 seniors, $3 students, $2 ages 7 to 17, 6 and under free.
It’s open daily 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., closed Thanksgiving, Christmas, and
New Year’s Day. See map p. 339.
 Check out the lifestyles of the timber rich and famous. Tour the
Riordan Mansion State Historic Park, 1300 Riordan Ranch St., on
the NAU campus, off South Milton Road (% 928-779-4395; www.
azstateparks.com), to see what you get when you mix a lot of
tree money and a little eccentricity. The 40-room native log-and-
stone mansion, built in 1904, was the domain of two lumber-baron
brothers who married sisters. Along with the more typical rich-
people trappings are one of the best collections of Craftsman furni-
ture in the country and photo transparencies of the Grand Canyon
that double as window panes. You can also see Paul Bunyan’s baby
shoes (it’s a long — and tall — story). Guided tours given on the
hour, one-half hour after the park opens (reservations recom-
mended). Admission is $6 adults, $2.50 ages 7 to 13, and children 6
and under are free. The grounds and visitor center are open May
through October daily 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., November through April
daily 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., and closed Christmas. See map p. 339.
Part IV: Exploring the Regions 
348

 See the stars. Interactive astronomy exhibits and fascinating
guided tour programs make the Lowell Observatory, 1400 West
Mars Hill Rd. (% 928-774-3358 or 928-774-2096 [after hours];
www.lowell.edu) terrific enough during the day, but peak science-
geek time is after dark when you can peer through the facility’s 
telescopes. Viewings are offered on Wednesdays, Fridays, and
Saturdays from September through May (from 7:30 p.m.), Monday
through Saturday June through August (from 8 p.m.). The tele-
scopes are in an open dome, so dress for an evening outdoors. Call
for directions and night-viewing ticket information. Admission (sep-
arate for day and evening programs) is $5 adults, $4 seniors and col-
lege students, $2 ages 5 to 17, and kids 4 and under are free. It’s
open November through February daily noon to 5 p.m. and March
through October daily 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; closed major holidays. See
map p. 339.
 Ride up to the sky. Even with no chance of snow on Mt. Agassiz,
one of the San Francisco Peaks, you can get lofted to the top via the
Arizona Snowbowl Scenic Skyride, Snowbowl Road, off Highway
180, about 15 miles north of town (% 928-779-1951; www.arizona
snowbowl.com). Riding the lift is the high point of a Flagstaff 
visit — 11,500 feet, to be precise — and on a clear day, you can 
see forever (well, at least to the North Rim of the Grand Canyon).
Admission is $10 adults, $8 seniors, $6 ages 8 to 12, and children
ages 7 and under and 70 and over ride free. It’s open Memorial Day
to Labor Day daily 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.; after Labor Day to mid-Oct it’s
open Friday to Sunday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. See map p. 339.
 See flora and fauna. Tour the Arboretum at Flagstaff, 4001 S.
Woody Mountain Rd. (% 928-774-1442; www.thearb.org), and 
find out all about the landscape of the Colorado Plateau, including
herbs believed to ward off vampires (you won’t see any here, so,
clearly, the plants work). The lovely woods and meadows (190
acres) encompass 10 gardens, four demonstration habitats, some
2,500 species of flora, plus lots of fauna. The raptor program, held
on weekends, is a huge hit with kids, as are the various bat-related
activities offered in summer. Hour-long guided tours, which depart
daily at 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., are included in the admission fee.
Admission is $5 adults, $2 ages 6 to 17, and kids 5 and under are
free. Hours are April 1 to October 31 daily 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; it’s
closed November through March. See map p. 339.
 See artifacts from Flagstaff’s past. The Arizona Historical Society’s
small Pioneer Museum, 2340 N. Fort Valley Rd. (Highway 180, north
of W. Fir Ave.; % 928-774-6272; www.arizonahistoricalsociety.
org), housed in Coconino County’s first (1908) hospital for the
poor, has a few grim displays, such as an old iron lung, but the
museum is generally upbeat about Flagstaff’s early days. A
“Playthings of the Past” exhibit opens every winter, and a couple 
Chapter 17: The Grand Canyon and Northwest Arizona 349

of railroad cars always sit out front. Admission is $3 adults, $2 sen-
iors and students, and ages 12 and younger are free. It’s open
Monday through Saturday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; closed New Year’s Day,
Thanksgiving, and Christmas. See map p. 339.
Havasu Canyon & Grand Canyon West
The two remote western sections of Grand Canyon National Park are the
domain of the Havasupai and the Hualapai people, who, respectively, run
the tourist enterprises of Havasu Canyon and Grand Canyon West. Visiting
them requires some planning — and in the case of Grand Canyon West, a
high clearance vehicle, if you’re not taking an air tour from Las Vegas.
Making plans to visit this area can get a bit confusing because the
Havasupai and Hualapai are closely related to one another (in fact, they
were once a single tribe). For example, you have to go to Hualapai Hilltop
and take Hualapai Trail to reach Havasu Canyon, which belongs to the
Havasupai people. And Peach Springs, the tribal capital of the Hualapai, is
not far from the turnoff for Supai, the Havasupai’s capital. Don’t worry.
Once you get to the area, it’ll all become as clear as Havasu Canyon’s
waterfalls.
If you’re coming from the east, the first reservation you’ll reach is that of
Havasupai, home to some 650 people and to Havasu Canyon, famous for
its astonishingly turquoise water and for the 200-foot waterfalls that cas-
cade down vivid red sandstone cliffs into limpid pools. Swimming in said
pools — and for some people, hiking into and out of the canyon — is pretty
much all you can do there; the village consists of fairly run-down homes.
If you can stand being forced to relax in a beautiful spot, though, this area
may just be your place.
From Williams, take I-40 west 44 miles to Seligman, where the road splits;
continue on Highway 66 west for 26 miles and turn north on Indian Route
18 (if you reach Peach Springs, you drove 6 miles too far). Drive 60 miles
to Haulupai Hilltop, where the 8-mile-long Hualapai Trail, a fairly precipi-
tous, winding route (at least for the first mile; it levels off after that)
descends into Supai, Havasu Canyon’s only settlement and home to the
Havasupai Tourist Enterprise (% 928-448-2121 or 928-448-2141; www.
havasupaitribe.com). A limited number of people are allowed in (fee $30
per person), so you must contact the tribe, even if you’re just planning to
hike. The Havasupai Tourist Enterprise isn’t always easy to reach by
phone, but keep trying.
If you don’t want to hike down, contact the tourist enterprise and arrange
for a pack horse or mule to take you and your luggage (round-trip rates
are $150 from Hualupai Hilltop to the campground). Again, be sure to con-
tact the trip in advance to make arrangements.
Alternatively, Papillon Grand Canyon Helicopters (% 800-528-2418 or
928-638-2419; www.papillon.com) runs daily excursions to Havasu
Canyon from the Grand Canyon Airport in Tusayan. For $505 per adult ($50
less if you book on the Internet), you get a round-trip helicopter ride plus
Part IV: Exploring the Regions 
350

a guided horseback ride to Havasu Falls (but no meals), returning the same
day. If you want to helicopter in and stay overnight at Havasupai Lodge
(see the paragraph that follows), you have to contact Papillon at least two
weeks — preferably a month — in advance, as rooms book up quickly.
The Havasupai Lodge ($$) in Supai (% 928-448-2111) has comfortable,
air-conditioned rooms, but no TVs or phones.
Grand Canyon West (also called the West Rim), though generally more
unknown than Havasu Canyon, has garnered recent media attention for its
Grand Canyon Skywalk, slated to open in 2006. As we go to press, however,
a concrete platform is the only evidence of this transparent walkway, soon

The (Mother) Road less taken
America’s first national highway, Route 66, was initially made famous by John
Steinbeck’s Grapes of Wrath, which detailed the mass exodus from the Dust Bowl
states in the 1930s on what the author called “the Mother Road.” That mournful image
was erased after World War II when the highway became a pleasure route, lined with
motor courts, souvenir shops, and neon-decked diners.
Arizona boasts two claims to Route 66 fame. It maintains the road’s longest continu-
ous stretch, some 140 miles on the state’s western side, and it is also home to Williams,
the last town to be bypassed (in 1984) by the four-lane divided thoroughfares that
upgraded the route mainly during the 1960s and 1970s. The portions of Route 66 that
are near Flagstaff and Williams (covered throughout this section) as well as the more
sporadic stretches that traverse the eastern part of the state (detailed in Chapter 18)
are all easily accessible from I-40. But nostalgia seekers need to make a detour in
order to traverse this less traveled, but more interesting segment of the western
stretch.
Highlights of the route, from west to east, include Oatman, a former mining boomtown
now famed for the friendly burros that roam past buildings like the 1902 Oatman Hotel,
where Clark Gable and Carole Lombard honeymooned; Kingman, the largest town on
this portion of Route 66, and home to the excellent Route 66 Museum; Peach Springs,
tribal headquarters for the Hualapai Nation and the place to book Colorado River and
Grand Canyon West adventures (see earlier in this section); Grand Canyon Caverns,
a cave system so dry that civil supplies for the Cuban Missile Crisis were stored here;
and Seligman, with classic Mother Road businesses like Angel Delgadillo’s Route 66
Gift Shop and the family’s Sno-Cap Drive In.
For more information about where to get your kicks, contact the Historic Route 66
Association of Arizona, 120 W. Route 66, in downtown Kingman (% 928-753-5001;
www.azrt66.com). The association’s Web site is also the place to scope out route-
related events, such as the three-day Route 66 annual Fun Run, held the first weekend
of May, when a very eclectic array of vehicles race from Seligman to Topock, on the
California border; or Route 66 Days in Flagstaff, an early-September event that includes
a sock hop and classic car displays.

to be perched some 4,000 feet above the canyon (my knees go weak even
thinking about it!), and its affiliated Grand Canyon Resort. However, two
overlooks, Guano Point and Eagle Point, already exist. Neither is quite as
spectacular as anything you’ll see on the Grand Canyon’s North or South
rims, but they’re still pretty impressive.
The best way to reach the remote West Rim is by air. Most of the flights
depart from Las Vegas; operators include Air Vegas (% 800-255-7474;
www.airvegas.com) and Scenic Airlines (% 800-634-6801; www.scenic.
com) Only Westwind Air Service (% 888-869-0866; www.westwindair
service.com) offers departures from Phoenix.
Note: The ones from the West Rim are the only air tours that actually land
in the Grand Canyon — and near the Colorado River no less. Tours, which
run about $350 per person from Las Vegas ($455 from Phoenix) usually
include a short boat ride.
The only other way to view the overlooks in Grand Canyon West is to drive
many miles along a gravel road that may be washed out in bad weather
and then take a Hualapai-run tour. But if you’re driving into Arizona from
the west anyway and have time for a rare look at the canyon, this vantage
point is worth investigating. See www.destinationgrandcanyon.com, for
details, or call the Hualapai Lodge (888-255-9550 or 928-769-2210), which
doubles as the nation’s tourism center. See “Staying Active” later in this
section for more information on the lodge and details of the tribe’s river
rafting trips.

p. 337.
Sunset Crater Volcano and Wupatki National Monuments
A double-header. When Sunset Crater erupted in A.D. 1064–1065 (that’s just
about the time William the Conqueror was taking over Europe), the
Sinagua Indians abandoned their fields and fled — only to return a few
decades after the action cooled down because the eruption had enriched
the soil and improved farming conditions. Sunset Crater and Wupatki
national monuments, connected by a 36-mile loop road, not only give you
a chance to witness the aftermath of a fiery natural phenomenon but also
take a look at the ancient civilizations directly affected by it.
You can take a 1-mile, self-guided walk around the base of the 1,000-foot-
high Sunset Crater, a study in red- and black-dotted pines, but the cone
itself is off-limits. If you enjoy climbing, ask at the visitor center about
ascending Lenox Crater or Doney Crater at Wupatki. Wupatki is interesting
enough for its well-preserved structures, but what makes it really unusual
is that three different native cultures — the Kayenta and the Cohonina peo-
ples, along with the Sinagua — coexisted here. Don’t miss the high-rise
pueblo for which the national monument is named (take the short trail
from the back of the Wupatki visitor center) and the Maya-like ball court
with its barometer-like blow hole.

15 and under free. Visitor centers summer 8 a.m.–6 p.m.; winter 8 a.m.–5 p.m.; closed
Christmas; monument gates open year-round sunrise–sunset.
Walnut Canyon National Monument
Move this spot to the top of your must-see list. This beautiful canyon is
worth visiting for its lush Ponderosa pine, juniper, and Douglas fir forest
alone, but you also can see — and even enter — some well-preserved cliff
dwellings built by the Sinagua people between 1125 A.D. and 1250 A.D. No
one is exactly sure why these dwellings were left behind by 1300. They
were protected over the years by limestone overhangs and the area’s dry
climate — only to be threatened by 19th-century picnickers, who
destroyed some of them.
If you’re in good shape, the steep 185-foot Island Trail down to the ruins
from the visitor center shouldn’t be a problem. But remember, you’re at
6,690 feet — which makes breathing hard to begin with. If you suffer from
respiratory problems or have bad knees, go for the easier half-mile Rim
Trail. You can still look out at the cliff dwellings, and explore prehistoric
pit houses.
See map p. 337. 10 miles southeast of Flagstaff (take I-40 7 1⁄2 miles east to Exit 204,

before the park closes; the Rim Trail closes 30 minutes before the park closes.
Williams
A town entry sign and the tourist brochures all hail Williams as the
“Gateway to the Grand Canyon,” but the town also has a life, thank you —
or at least a past. In its logging and railroad heyday, this alpine outpost

Pseudo sunset, pseudo moon
When the iron and sulfur in the lava that flowed from Sunset Crater during its last 
eruption (around A.D. 1250) oxidized, it gave the volcano rim a red and yellow “sunset”
glow — and a perpetually molten, about-to-blow look. Fast forwarding ahead some
seven centuries, the lava flow at Sunset Crater looked so much like the moon’s surface
that NASA sent Neil Armstrong and other astronauts over to practice their rock spec-
imen collecting (Armstrong must have passed the rock test; he was the first man to
walk on the moon).

bustled with brothels, bars, and opium dens. The population (around 3,000
at the 2000 census) is about the same now as it was then, but it’s nowhere
near as wild. At one time, the town became a popular Route 66 stopover.
Along with hiking the woods or strolling the streets, you may want to visit
before or after you ride the Grand Canyon rails.
 Ride the rails. Even if you’re not too-too-tootling away, the Grand
Canyon Railway depot (just west of Grand Canyon Boulevard,
north of the tracks) is the most happening place in town. The enter-
tainment includes staged cowboy hi-jinx at 9 a.m. (before the train
departs). A free museum devoted to Grand Canyon hospitality is
open the rest of the day; a steam locomotive and coach car are
among the items on display. See the “Riding the Grand Canyon
rails” sidebar later in this chapter. See map p. ###.
 Talk to the animals. The Grand Canyon Deer Farm is 8 miles east
of Williams (Exit 171 of I-40; % 800-926-3337 or 928-635-4073; www.
deerfarm.com). This place is great for kids to get up-close-and-
personal with Bambi — as well as with llamas, miniature horses,
pygmy goats, wallabies, turkeys, buffalo, and more. Admission is
$7.50 adults, $6.50 seniors, $4.50 ages 3 to 13; the corn-and-pellet
feed mixture costs extra. Weather permitting, it’s open November
to February daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., March to May and September 
to October 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., and June to August 8 a.m.–7 p.m.
Staying active
Home to Northern Arizona University’s High Altitude Sports Training
Complex for Olympic athletes, surrounded by forest, and flanked by the
highest mountains in the state, Flagstaff is outdoor-adventure central for
northern Arizona. Williams is no slouch either, when it comes to playing
outdoors.
 Bicycling. With lots of woodsy, fresh-air trails, the Flagstaff area
offers high-altitude bicycling at its best. Visit downtown’s Absolute
Bikes, 18 North San Francisco St. (% 928-779-5969; www.absolute
bikes.net), for information and rentals year-round, and for classes
in summer. Another good resource is www.flagstaffbiking.org.

and last names?).

walls in the Southwest (who measures these things, anyway?). Costs
run $15 for a day pass, $29 if you want equipment and a lesson, too.
A variety of outdoor classes and personal instruction options are
available.
 Golfing: Elephant Rocks, 2200 Country Club Dr. (3 miles west of
downtown Williams; % 928-635-4935; www.elephant-rocks.com),
had to give up its title as the self-proclaimed “No. l 9-hole golf
course in Arizona,” when Gary Panks, the original course architect,
made it into an 18-holer a few years ago. But the course has other
lures to compensate — a pretty Ponderosa pine setting and low
greens fees ($49 weekends, $39 weekdays with cart). This well-
maintained municipal course is open from March to November,
with discounts available early and late in the season.
 Hiking: Locals head for glen and dale (whatever a dale is) in the
San Francisco Peaks and Coconino National Forest when the white
stuff isn’t covering up the trails. Taking the Arizona Snowbowl ski
lift up Mt. Agassiz (see the “Exploring lower northwest Arizona”
section earlier in this section) and hiking back down is especially
fun. Get trail maps and advice about the best trekking spots from
the Coconino National Forest office, 1824 S. Thompson St. (% 928-
527-3600); Peaks Ranger District office, 5075 N. Highway 89 (% 928-
526-0866); Mormon Lake Ranger District office, 4373 S. Lake Mary
Road (% 928-774-1147). The Web site for all three areas is www.fs.
fed.us/r3/coconino and all three offices are open Monday to
Friday 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 a.m.
 River rafting: If you don’t have time for a weeklong Grand Canyon
rafting trip but want to get your toes into the chilly Colorado River,
consider an excursion with the Haulapai River Runners (% 928-
769-2219). Trips, which cost $289 per person for a full day, depart
from Peach Springs (see Havasu Canyon & Grand Canyon West in
the “Exploring lower northwest Arizona” section earlier in this sec-
tion) on the Hualupai reservation. Expect a combination of white
and calm waters and lots of wonderful scenery. Bookings get you
discounted rates at the tribe’s affiliated Hualapai Lodge ($$), 900

ties and lodging, contact the tribe (% 888-255-9550 or 928-769-

or 928-779-4577 for the snow report; www.arizonasnowbowl.com),
where you can rent anything snow-oriented, including snowboards
and the latest in parabolic skis. The 32 slopes (2,300 vertical ft.,
total) have a nice mix of beginner, intermediate, and advanced
runs. Lift tickets range from $29 for a half-day midweek pass to $44
for a weekend all-day pass (adults). Ages 8 to 12 pay $20 for a half
day, $25 full day, no matter what day of the week. This ski area has
always been weather dependent because no ground water was
available for snow making on Mt. Agassiz, an extinct volcano; in
2006, it was only open for about three weeks in March.
Chapter 17: The Grand Canyon and Northwest Arizona 355

At 30 acres, the Elk Ridge Ski and Outdoor Recreation Area, ten
minutes south of town (take Fourth St. to the Kaibab National Forest;
% 928-635-9434; www.elkridgeski.com), may be the smallest in
the state, but the area’s fun for snow-bonding families who can also
rent sleds and inner tubes for a sledding hill. Formerly the Williams
Ski Area, this place changed owners in 2005 and didn’t reopen until
late 2006; when we went to press, the rates had not been set, but
expect them to be very reasonable.
Cross-country-ski aficionados have a couple of options. The Flagstaff
Nordic Center, operated by Snowbowl, 15 miles north of Flagstaff on
18400 N. Hwy. 180 (% 928-220-0550; www.flagstaffnordiccenter),
has 40km of groomed track. All-day trail passes cost $12 during the
week, $15 on the weekends (with discounts for booking online). 
An eco-cabin and a yurt are available for rent. The Mormon Lake 
Ski Touring Center, 28 miles south of Flagstaff on Lake Mary Road
(% 928-354-2240), has more than 21 miles of groomed ski trails in
the Coconino National Forest; see the “Hiking” section, above, for
additional information on the area. Both ski centers rent equipment.
Shopping for local treasures
This region is rich in Native American jewelry and crafts and Route 66
memorabilia, among other things.
In Flagstaff, downtown is the most fertile retail ground; sporting goods,
crafts, and nostalgia are among the bestsellers. Babbitt’s Backcountry
Outfitters, 12 E. Aspen Ave. (%. 928-774-4775) and its nearby sibling
Babbitt’s Sports Center, 109 N. Leroux St. (% 928-774-2960), carry a
huge array of trekking and angling equipment and clothing, down to a
baby T-shirt that reads “I may be small but I’m a keeper.” The Artists
Gallery, 17 N. San Francisco St. (% 928-773-0958), represents more
than 40 locals who work in genres ranging from stained glass and callig-
raphy to sculpture. Check out some of the outstanding jewelry. Winter
Sun Trading Company, 107 N. San Francisco St. (% 928-774-2884), is 
a combination of a native arts and crafts gallery, a bookstore, and an
apothecary, complete with made-to-order remedies. You name it . . . if
it’s herbal, hand-crafted, or New Age, you’ll find it here.
In the month of July, Navajo and Hopi artisans come from all over the
Southwest to show — and sell — their work at two huge annual festivals
of art and culture at the Museum of Northern Arizona (see the “Exploring
lower northwest Arizona” section earlier in this chapter). Other times of
the year, you can make do with the extensive selection at the museum
gift shop.
In Williams, a somewhat slim selection of crafts and antiques shops is
located downtown, along historic Route 66. As a result, it’s tough to find
a store on Williams’s main streets that doesn’t hawk Route 66-o-bilia.
The Route 66 Place at Twisters (see “Dining locally” earlier in this chap-
ter) has the best selection. If your retro hankerings relate to horseplay

rather than hot-rodding, check out De Berge Western Wear, 213 W. 
Rte. 66 (% 928-635-5233).
Living it up after dark
Artsy types and night owls throughout northern Arizona flock to Flagstaff
after dark. Williams has far less to offer — but in summer, you don’t have
to go bed directly after dinner; a little night music is the ticket at several
spots in town.
In Flagstaff
Flagstaff offers both an arts and a nightlife scene, and they’re not half
bad either. Check the weekend nightlife/arts insert of the Arizona Daily
Sun or the free Live! tabloid for detailed listings of what’s on during your
visit.
Summer’s the high culture pinnacle, with various Native American festi-
vals, marketplaces, exhibits, and lectures at the Museum of Northern
Arizona (see the “Exploring lower northwest Arizona” section earlier 
in this chapter, and check www.musnaz.org for a schedule). But the
Flagstaff Symphony Orchestra, 113A E. Aspen Ave. (% 888-520-7214 for
tickets, or 928-774-5107; www.flagstaffsymphony.org), a fine regional
ensemble that has been around since 1949, stays tuned up year-round.
The beautifully restored historic Orpheum Theater, 15 W. Aspen St. 
(% 928-556-1580; www.orpheumpresents.com) offers an eclectic mix 
of plays, film festivals, and concerts. In addition, Theatrikos, Flagstaff
Playhouse, 11 W. Cherry St. (% 928-774-1662; www.theatrikos.com),
can satisfy your basic thespian needs in all seasons. From Memorial Day
to Labor Day, Heritage Square, on Aspen Avenue between Leroux and San
Francisco streets (% 928-774-6929; www.heritagesquaretrust.org),
puts on a great array of free entertainment, from salsa dancing on
Wednesday evenings to “Movies on the Square,” which screens family-
friendly films on Friday nights.
The club scene changes constantly but you usually find something hap-
pening at downtown’s two historic hotels. Charly’s at the Weatherford,
23 N. Leroux (% 928-779-1919), mostly hosts rock bands, while the
Monte Vista lounge, 100 N. San Francisco St. (% 928-779-6971), brings
in a variety of local and national acts. Beer lovers find their bliss in down-
town Flagstaff: In addition to the fairly ferny Beaver Street Brewery (see
the “Dining locally” section earlier in this chapter), check out the funky
Mogollon Brewing Company, 15 N. Agassiz St. (% 928-773-8950), which,
in addition to handcrafting beers, now micro-distills prickly pear vodka,
and the Flagstaff Brewing Company, 16 E. Rte. 66 (% 928-773-1442),
which compensates for a lack of strong suds personality with an impres-
sive array of single-malts and small-batch bourbons. These last two often
have live music. A slightly older, more sophisticated set tends to frequent
the Wine Loft, 17 N. San Francisco St. (% 928-773-WINE); it’s on the
second floor and easy to miss, but keep looking. Macy’s and Campus
Coffee Bean (see the “Bean there, done that” sidebar in this chapter)
often host low-key acoustic groups.

In Williams
In summer, you find live music somewhere in town most nights, either 
at Pancho McGillicuddy’s, 141 Railroad Ave. (% 928-635-4150) or at
Cruisers (see the “Dining locally’” section earlier in this chapter). The
Typhoon Saloon at the Wild West Junction, 321 E. Rte. 66 (% 928-814-
9296), often has live sounds too. You can also wander over for a drink at
Spenser’s Lounge in the Grand Canyon Railway Hotel (see the “Spending
the night” section earlier in this chapter). The gorgeous carved-wood
19th-century bar was shipped over to the hotel from Ireland.
Maybe you like your night haunts haunted. Every evening from May
through October, Saloon Row Ghost Tours (% 928-635-4530 or 928-
600-3024; www.saloonrowghosttour.com) depart from the Red Garter
B&B (see the “Best little whorehouse in Arizona” sidebar earlier in this
chapter) at 7:45 p.m. You’ll be regaled with spine-tingling tales of the
supernatural while walking around town for 90 minutes (cost: $10).
Another supernatural phenomenon — this one of the friendly, magical 
variety — is explored in winter, when the Polar Express tootles into town.
See the “Riding the Grand Canyon rails” sidebar later in this chapter for
details.

Chapter 17: The Grand Canyon and Northwest Arizona 359
The South Rim of the Grand Canyon
Even if seeing the Grand Canyon isn’t your sole reason for going to
Arizona, you probably still have to visit it. If you don’t, you’ll spend
more time explaining why you didn’t than you’ll spend getting there. (I’m
exhausted even thinking about it.) But that’s okay, because the Grand
Canyon deserves all the press it gets. One of the most amazing things
about the canyon is that it seems to appear out of nowhere. You drive
around this pleasant but fairly ordinary pine forest and then — wham!
The commercialism and crowds that surround the South Rim may, on
the other hand, put you off, as they do me — which is why I show you
how to get the most out of your experience, whether you just go for the
day or make a bigger time commitment.
I’m going to beg you to please come during the off season if you can.
Summer, spring, and fall are the busiest months. You’re much happier
here from November through February (the crowds are minimal, and 
if snow falls, you have the considerable bonus of seeing the Grand
Canyon dusted by all that pretty white stuff). But if you can’t — and I 
forgive you — book hotel rooms and popular tours, such as river rafting
and mule rides, well in advance (more on that in the “Inside the park”
section later in this chapter), so you get to do everything that you really
want to do. Reserving some attractions in advance during the quieter
months is also important; I let you know which ones, honest.

See map p. 361 for locations of accommodations, services, and attrac-
tions in or near Grand Canyon Village.
Getting there
In Arizona every type of transport takes you to the state’s top tourist
attraction.
By car
The Grand Canyon Village on the South Rim is 59 miles north of Williams
via Highway 64 from I-40 and 78 miles northwest of Flagstaff via High-
way 180. If you take the scenic route from the east from via Cameron
(Highway 89 to Highway 64), you’ll drive 107 miles from Flagstaff. See the
“Arizona Driving Times and Distances” map on the Cheat Sheet at the
front of the book for details about getting to the Grand Canyon from
other popular points in and around the state.
By plane
The Grand Canyon National Park Airport (% 928-638-2446) is 6 miles
south of the Grand Canyon in Tusayan. Most flights into the airport are
via Las Vegas with tour operators, such as Air Vegas (% 800-255-7474;
www.airvegas.com) and Scenic Airlines (% 800-634-6801; www.scenic.
com). You can buy just transportation (from about $220 round-trip), but
purchasing a sightseeing package is more economical (from $255, includ-
ing a coach tour). Only Westwind Air Service (% 888-869-0866; www.
westwindairservice.com) runs regular air tours from Phoenix to the
Grand Canyon. Approximately $375 per person buys a same-day round-
trip flight, bus tour, and lunch. Again, booking a flight alone is more costly.
You can taxi to Grand Canyon Village from the airport (see the “Getting
around” section).
By shuttle bus
Open Road Tours (% 800-766-7117 or 602-997-6474; www.openroad
tours.com) makes daily trips year-round to the Grand Canyon from
Flagstaff ($27 each way adults, $19 ages 11 and under) and Williams ($17
each way adults, $12 children), plus $6 for entrance into the national
park. Round-trips are double the price of a one-way.
By train
Amtrak (% 800-872-7245; www.amtrak.com) runs into downtown
Flagstaff and also stops near Williams (an Amtrak bus takes you the rest
of the way). You can shuttle into the Grand Canyon from both towns
(see the preceding “By shuttle bus” section), but if you come this far by
train — and even if you don’t — by all means continue on into the park
via the Grand Canyon Railway (see the “Riding the Grand Canyon rails”
sidebar).

Getting around
If, like most people, you approach the Grand Canyon from the south, the
first place you come to is Tusayan, a national park feeder (and sleeper)
town with a glut of mostly chain motels, fast-food restaurants, and tour
operators. Another mile north on Highway 64 you find the park entry-
way/fee station, and an additional 6 miles from the entryway you see the
park’s visitor hub, Grand Canyon Village (which is not, however, where
the visitor center is — more on that in this chapter’s “And it doesn’t
have a canyon view, either” sidebar). Unfortunately, no bus service cur-
rently operates between the two hubs. Phoning for a cab is the only way
to get from Tusayan into the national park without a car.
If you arrive via Cameron and Highway 64 East, you pay your fee 25 miles
back and take the scenic Desert View Drive before reaching Grand
Canyon Village. The other main route within the park is the Hermits Rest
Route; both are described in more detail in the “Exploring the South Rim”
section later in this chapter.
Part IV: Exploring the Regions 
362
Riding the Grand Canyon rails
Train travel to the Grand Canyon was hot when it was introduced in 1901, but by 1927
it was already passé. Automobile fever had taken hold of the country, and more people
wanted to drive than to ride the rails. In 1968, rail service was suspended for lack of
interest; only three passengers rattled around the train on the last national park run.
But that was then. In the last couple of decades, after people began to realize that car
exhaust probably wasn’t all that good for the canyon, the Grand Canyon Railway 
(% 800-THE-TRAIN; www.thetrain.com) came back by popular demand — and in
close to its original form. Every day (except Dec 24 and 25) the train leaves from the
Williams depot in the morning on a two-and-a-quarter-hour (each way) sentimental
journey. Restored locomotives — one dating back to 1906 — pull the refurbished
Pullman cars while cowboy balladeers and “outlaws” entertain the passengers.
The five classes of service range from Pullman Coach (available in summer only) ($60
adult round-trip, $35 ages 11–16, $25 ages 2–10 round-trip) to Luxury Parlor Car ($155
adults, $130 for all under age 16, including entrance fees to the Grand Canyon). (I sug-
gest you ride coach; the extra hors d’oeuvres and beverages and, in some cases,
vistas, in the higher classes aren’t worth the added expense.) All kinds of packages,
most of them involving a stay at the Grand Canyon Railway Hotel (see the “Williams”
section of “Spending the night” earlier in this chapter) and tours are available. Call for
details or click on the “Packages” box on the train’s Web site.
In addition to its Grand Canyon service, in November, December, and January, you
can board the train to the North Pole via The Polar Express. Prices ($24 adults, $12
ages 2–6) include hot chocolate and cookies and a visit with Santa Claus. And it’s ok
to wear your jammies on the train.

By shuttle
Free shuttles operate within the national park year-round. The Village
Route circles through Grand Canyon Village, also stopping at Yavapai
Point and the visitor center. The Hermits Rest Route goes to eight canyon
overlooks west of the Bright Angel Lodge, making all stops westbound but
only two on the way back; and the Kaibab Trail Route provides trans-
portation between the visitor center, the South Kaibab Trailhead, and 
Yaki Point. An early morning Hikers Shuttle leaves from Bright Angel and
Maskwik lodges to the South Kaibab Trailhead (see the “Active views:
Getting down in the canyon” section in this chapter). The Hermits Rest
shuttle doesn’t operate in winter (when Hermit Road is open to private
cars), but the other two shuttles remain in service the entire year.
But don’t worry: You don’t have to remember any of this. The park serv-
ice publication called The Guide (see the “Entering the park” section later
in this chapter) tells you everything you need to know about routes and
schedules (which change month by month). The information is also avail-
able on the Grand Canyon National Park Service Web site: www.nps.
gov/grca.
Chapter 17: The Grand Canyon and Northwest Arizona 363
Grand Canyon car talk
In order to ensure a safe drive around the canyon:
 Make sure your car is in good shape. The Grand Canyon Garage, east of the Grand
Canyon National Park Lodges’ General Offices, in Grand Canyon Village 
(% 928-638-2631, ext. 6502), is open for repairs from 8 a.m. to noon and 1 to 5 p.m.
and has 24-hour emergency service, but it’s the only game in town; you never
know how long it’ll take for your part to come in.
 Always carry an extra set of car keys with you (they’re not much help inside your
hotel room). The canyon doesn’t have a resident locksmith.
 Fill ’er up before you enter. Gas stations aren’t exactly clustered on every canyon
corner. Only one station, Desert View Chevron, is inside the national park near
the eastern park entry and it’s not open in winter. A service station is available in
Tusayan, and you find others just outside the south entrance to the park near
Apache Stables and in Cameron.
 Carry water, especially in summer when your car — and you — are more prone
to overheat.
 Don’t even think about trying to park at the popular spots like the El Tovar Lodge.
Alternatives include the lot near the supermarket/deli at Market Plaza near
Yavapai Lodge (cars tend to move in and out of here frequently) and the lot near
the Backcountry Information Center. You can pick up shuttle buses from all the
parking lots.

See the “Getting there” section in the “The North Rim of the Grand Canyon
(and More)” section later in this chapter, for details on the Transcanyon
Shuttle.
By taxi
Strange but true: You can cab it to the canyon. Xanterra South Rim 
(% 928-638-2822) runs round-the-clock taxi service from Tusayan to
Grand Canyon Village and nearby — $5 per person, with a $10 minimum.
Entering the park
The cost is $25 per vehicle to enter the park, $12 per person for bikers
and walkers (ages 15 and under free). If you plan to visit other national
parks anyway and come in high season, I suggest you invest $50 (in
advance) in a National Parks Pass. Not only does the pass get you and
your family into all the National Parks for an entire year, but buying one
lets you thumb your nose at the other cars as you breeze through the
express lane for seasonal pass holders (sometimes the wait on the other
lines can be as long as 30 minutes). To order a pass, call % 888-GO-
PARKS between 6 a.m. and 2 p.m., Pacific standard time, every day (out-
side those hours, you can leave a message and you’ll get a return call) or
go online to www.nationalparks.org. You must pay an additional $3.95
for regular mail service (8–13 business days), $12 if you need the pass to
arrive within 5 to 7 business days.
As soon as you pay your park fee, the gate attendant hands you a copy
of The Guide, which has maps of the park, transportation schedules, lists
of daily programs, warnings about all the dire things that can happen to
you if you go hiking unprepared . . . your basic Grand Canyon bible. If
your guide isn’t coffee-stained and half-shredded by the end of the day,
you aren’t consulting it enough.
Part IV: Exploring the Regions 
364
And it doesn’t have a canyon view, either
The National Park Service made a bit of a blooper when it designed the Canyon View
Information Plaza near the Grand Canyon’s west (main) entrance at the beginning of
the new millennium. Located about 150 feet from Mather Point, this orientation center
was intended to be the terminus for a public transportation system that has been put
on hold indefinitely. No parking lot adjoins it. The closest place to put your car is at the
Mather Point overlook. If you don’t find parking at Mather Point (and doing so is tough
in high season), you need to drive farther into the park and take one of the free shut-
tles back to CVIP. You can also get oriented at the Yavapai Observation Station.
If you drive in from the east, you pass the Desert View Contact Station, which is staffed
by volunteers and doesn’t always keep regular hours in winter. But between the trad-
ing post, cafeteria, service station, and bookstore in the Desert View Complex, you
can find out whatever it is you need to know.

Spending the night
Beauty doesn’t always come easy (as any cosmetician can tell you): The
closer you want to be to the canyon, the harder it is to get a room. But if
you want to gaze out at the canyon as soon as possible after you wake
up, the view is worth the effort. If staying in the park is not important to
you, plenty of options, from bare bones to luxury, are available; see the
“Outside the park” section.
Inside the park
If you visit anytime from April through October and want to have a bed
inside the national park, don’t wait until the last minute to book. The best
rooms at the El Tovar and Bright Angel Lodge sell out as much as a year
in advance. You have a decent chance of getting something in Tusayan,
the tourist village just south of the park, on short notice, but don’t push
your luck.
However, if you don’t mind living on the edge — or maybe I should say
really want to — snagging last-minute accommodations isn’t impossible.
Emergency cancellations and no-shows (from 15–30 a day in summer)
always occur. Either call the park’s same-day lodging switchboard at 
% 928-638-2631 in the morning, or go to the front desk of the hotel
you’re interested in around 2 or 3 in the afternoon. By then, hotels know
who has decided to check out a day early. Or, if you tried well in advance
and couldn’t get the hotel you had your heart set on, try again a month
Chapter 17: The Grand Canyon and Northwest Arizona 365
Staying near the canyon edge: yes or no?
Wanting to bunk right near the Grand Canyon is not as much of a no-brainer as you
might imagine.
Consider this. If you stay near the rim — Thunderbird and Kachina lodges, the El Tovar
Hotel, and Bright Angel Lodge & Cabins all fall into that category — parking by your
room is going to be a problem every season except winter. Indeed, most of the year, if
you check in during daylight hours, there’s a very good chance you’ll have to drop your
luggage off at the hotel, park your car elsewhere, and take a shuttle back before you
can unpack. Moreover, even if your hotel is near the rim, there’s no guarantee that
you’ll actually be able to ogle the canyon from your room. Finally, two of the premiere
rim accommodations, El Tovar and Bright Angel, don’t have many two-bedded rooms,
nor do they allow for roll-away beds. This means they’re not good picks if you prefer
not to get very up close and personal with your traveling companion at night or are
traveling with family.
Pros? You’ll be within easy walking distance of all the top shops and restaurants — not
to mention very close to the reason you’re here in the first place, the Grand Canyon.
No need to hop on a shuttle or take a drive first thing in the morning to see the sun rise
over one of the most glorious spots on Earth.

before you want to come: Large groups are required to cancel 30 days in
advance in order to get their deposits refunded, so a block of rooms may
suddenly open up.
You must book all the accommodations inside Grand Canyon National
Park through the official parks concessionaire, Xanterra Parks & Resorts
(% 888-29-PARKS or 303-29-PARKS; www.grandcanyonlodges.com).
Most of the lodges cluster on the western portion of Grand Canyon
Village. For locations, see the Grand Canyon Village map, in this chapter.
All the major credit cards (except Diners Club) are accepted for rooms.
The lodges described in detail below are my top picks. However, the
other accommodations in the national park have advantages, too,
including that all offer rooms with two beds and the option of roll-away
beds, which makes them family friendly. Thunderbird and Kachina ($$),
two adjoining lodges on the rim, both underwent renovations recently.
As a result, their rooms are attractive and cheerful, and in both, half the
rooms have “partial canyon” views — which may be entirely astounding.
However, if you don’t book one of these, you’ve got all the disadvantages
of staying near the rim, with none of the compensatory character of El
Tovar and Bright Angel.
At the east end of Grand Canyon Village, the two Yavapai Lodges ($$) are
the farthest from the rim, but plenty of parking, a tour desk, a cafeteria, a
bank, and the largest market in the canyon compensate. The wooded set-
ting is nothing to sneeze at, either (unless you’re allergic to junipers and
piñon pines). Rooms at Yavapai East, redone in 2003, are larger and more
pleasant than those at Yavapai West, which offer ceiling fans rather than
air-conditioning.
For lodge locations, see map p. 361.
With the exception of Maswik and Yavapai lodges, which have different
winter room tariffs, rates listed apply year-round. Check the Xanterra
Web site for seasonal specials and packages — most of them occurring
in winter, naturally.
Bright Angel Lodge & Cabins
$–$$
On the rim
This has long been one of my favorites, but 2007 may not be the best year
to stay here: The lodge is undergoing major renovations, so things may be
a bit chaotic. Maybe I should say more chaotic, as the lodge already has a
wildly busy tour desk, a museum, a coffee shop, a steakhouse, and a soda
fountain. That said, Bright Angel, which was designed in 1935 by Mary
Colter — responsible for several of the park’s most striking buildings — is
a beauty. And the rates are still a bargain. Rooms in the main lodge offer a
private or shared bath (some have only a sink, while others have both sink
and toilet but no shower). Individual cabins are all fully equipped, and four

rustic but not shabby, and they suit the piney setting.

On the rim
Majorly revamped in 2005 to celebrate its 100th anniversary, this hotel
now lives up to its fame. The public areas of this native-stone and pine
building, a cross between a hunting lodge and a Norwegian villa, have
always been impressive, but the guest rooms were tired and fussy. Now,
furnishings are clean-lined in the Craftsman style, a perfect complement to
the setting. And all the bathrooms, though in the style of an earlier era —
not the earliest, though; private bathrooms weren’t an option in 1905 —
are gleaming new. Yes, this place is crowded, and you won’t necessarily
get a canyon view, but at least now the rooms are worth angling to get.

Miles to go before you sleep
When people complain that it’s a hike to their rooms, they’re usually talking about an
extra-long walk from the parking lot. But to get to Phantom Ranch, you either have to
trek 9 miles to the bottom of the Grand Canyon, raft down a river, or get a mule to carry
you. Lodgings, in wood-and-uncut-river-stone cabins designed by Mary Colter (these
cabins are mostly reserved for mule riders), or in newer gender-separated hiker dorms,
are booked as much as a year in advance.
One-night mule trips to Phantom Ranch (and back . . .), including three meals, run $370
per person, $661 for two people. Hiker cabins cost $81 for two people, $12 for an addi-
tional person; dorm bunks run $29 per person. Meals need to be reserved, too: $18
breakfast, $10 box lunch, $21 to $31 dinner (the price depends on the entree). Like all
the other national park bookings, these reservations must be made through Xanterra
(%
888-29-PARKS
or 
303-29-PARKS; 
www.grandcanyonlodges.com).
Incidentally, Colter named the ranch for a phantom that, according to Havasupai
legend, emerged from the underworld at this spot and definitely liked what he saw.

Maswik. The spacious rooms in Maswik North, which underwent a $3.3-
million renovation in 2006 and have all the mod-cons (including in-room
refrigerators) plus balconies looking out on the Ponderosa pine forest, are
my top away-from-the-canyon pick. Rooms in Maswik South, less expen-
sive because they’re smaller and, in general, viewless, are still appealing.
Least expensive of all are the rustic 1940s cabins (only available in
summer). These are closest to the road, have somewhat thin walls, and
come with ceiling fans rather than air-conditioning. That said, all the
rooms in Maswik were refreshed in the 2000s and have nice Western
touches — you can’t go wrong with any of them.
See map p. 361. Rack rates: $76 cabins, $83 Maswik South double, $130 Maswik North
double; $79 Maswik South and $92 Maswik North doubles in winter.

Two other places worth considering are the Anasazi Inn Grey Mountain

scenic a setting as Cameron but offering decent inexpensive rooms and
convenient access to the Grand Canyon’s eastern approach; and the
family-friendly Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites ($$), Tusayan 
(% 888-473-2269 or 928-638-3000; www.grandcanyon.hiexpress.com)
where an annex offers large, well-equipped (microwave, coffeemaker,

goods; a historic restaurant serving primo Navajo tacos; and rooms
arranged among lovely terraced gardens (the staff handcrafted most of the
furnishings). The only drawbacks: You can’t have a beer (or any other
booze) because you’re on the Navajo reservation, and you run the risk of
never making it to the Grand Canyon because you need “just five more
minutes” in that trading post.

Old West trappings plus modern plumbing — what could be bad?
Tusayan’s newest hotel was designed to resemble the national park lodges,
with a high-ceiling lobby, lots of Native American rugs, wrought-iron lamps,
antler chandelier — you get the picture. Guest rooms have beamed ceil-
ings and, in some cases, small balconies (although you don’t see much
from them but the parking lot). The hotel’s Canyon Star restaurant (see
Dining locally, the next section) is excellent. Other pluses: an indoor pool

Dining locally
Although the Grand Canyon isn’t a complete void, food-wise, the park
doesn’t exactly have a glut of good restaurants. Still, you can expect
good, hearty fare at reasonable prices in both the Grand Canyon Village
and Tusayan.
Among the casual restaurants inside the park, my favorite is the
Delicatessen at Marketplace ($) in Market Plaza, which serves fresh
pizzas, calzones, salads, and healthful sandwiches. The Canyon Café ($),
the cafeteria at Yavapai Lodge, also in Market Plaza, has something for
everyone, including inexpensive, tasty Tex-Mex selections. The food at
the Bright Angel Coffeehouse ($–$$) is nothing to write home about,
but the view, if you’re lucky enough to snag a window table, is. All are
open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner (an early one, in the case of the
deli). All take major credit cards, but no reservations.
In Tusayan, chains such as McDonald’s, Wendy’s, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut
help maintain family harmony, but the best full-service — notice I didn’t
say slow-food — restaurants are the Canyon Star ($$$) (listed below)
and the Coronado Dining Room ($$$) in the Best Western Canyon Squire
Inn (see Spending the night, earlier in this section), with an eclectic, fairly
upscale menu, ranging from enchiladas and vegetarian dishes to prime
rib and game.

The crowds come as much for the Grand Canyon views as for the meat,
although the open-kitchen preparations of the American standards, sev-

The American dishes are fine, but why not go local with the Navajo tacos

tortillas). They’re among the best anywhere, and they’re huge, so unless
you’re training for a sumo wrestling match, I suggest you share.

Under a log-beamed roof built to resemble that of a hogan (hexagonal

has to offer. The menu includes some Asian-inspired items such as lobster
spring rolls or lettuce wraps. They’re fine if you want to eat light, but, per-
sonally, I’d go straight for specialties like the house-smoked baby back ribs
with Jack Daniels BBQ sauce, or the rib-eye steak with garlic mashed pota-
toes. A menu “For the Little Gunslinger” plus nightly entertainment —
everything from Native American dances to karaoke and Country Western
bands — makes this a great choice for families who like to eat well (if not
cheaply). If you do want to economize, the adjoining bar area offers less
expensive burgers and the like.

Exploring the South Rim
You can hover over the canyon in a helicopter, run a rim-to-rim
marathon — or go for something in between the two; you’re the best
judge of the touring style that suits you. In general, the approaches to
the canyon in the “Overviews: Driving around the canyon” section are
designed for day-trippers; many of the activities in the “Active views:
Getting down in the canyon” section require a much greater time 
commitment.
Chapter 17: The Grand Canyon and Northwest Arizona 371
Ode to erosion: Some Grand Canyon stats
The erosive action of the Colorado River formed the Grand Canyon, which continues
to be shaped by the river, along with rain runoff, and snow melt. One of the world’s
seven natural wonders, the canyon racks up some pretty impressive numbers:
 Grand Canyon National Park covers more than a million acres (1,218,375.54, to be
exact).
 The canyon is 277 miles long, as the Colorado River flows.
 The distance between the South Rim and the North Rim at Grand Canyon Village
is 10 miles, as the crow (or other bird of your choice) flies.
 At its lowest point from the rim, the canyon dips 6,000 vertical feet, but it’s by no
means the deepest canyon in the world — deeper ones include the Copper
Canyon in Mexico and Hell’s Canyon in Idaho.
 The oldest rocks exposed at the bottom of the canyon are close to 2 billion years
old — which is only about half as old as the oldest rocks in the world. The canyon
itself is a mere babe, just 5 or 6 million years old.

No matter what you do, don’t be surprised if you feel headachy and slug-
gish your first day in the Grand Canyon, especially if you don’t spend
any time beforehand in Flagstaff or Williams. Adjusting to the altitude
(7,000 ft.) takes a while.
One final point before you take the plunge (as it were): The park rangers
always have activities organized, even in winter — everything from geol-
ogy talks to guided nature walks and grab-bag question-and-answer ses-
sions. Check The Guide’s schedule of programs as soon as you get a
copy so you don’t find yourself leafing through it in late afternoon and
muttering, “Darn, that sounded good.”
Overviews: Driving around the canyon
Rim drives are a great way to take in some of the canyon’s best views. I
highlight the two most popular drives — along the Desert View and
Hermits Rest routes.
Of the two paved drives that radiate to the rim from Grand Canyon
Village, the Hermits Rest Route is the shorter and, off season, the more
popular. During high season, March 1 to December 1, this route is closed
to private cars, and you must board a free shuttle to tour it. At this time,
the Desert View Drive, which is open to cars, becomes the more popu-
lar route — which means you may have to wait to park your car at the
various lookout points.
 Driving the Hermits Rest Route: (Remember, this route can be
driven only in Dec, Jan, and Feb, but the lookout points remain the
same year-round, so these descriptions may help you decide where
to get off the shuttle bus.) This 8-mile drive was first laid out in
1912, when horse-drawn buggies still outnumbered automobiles.
The first stop is Trailview Overlook and Trailview Overlook II,
which look down on the Bright Angel and Plateau Point hiking
trails, and, in a lush cottonwood grove, Indian Gardens camp-
ground. The soaring San Francisco Peaks lie to the south, and if 
you gaze in you-know-which direction, you can also glimpse the
North Rim. Look out from Maricopa Point to spot the remains of
the 1893 Orphan Mine, which yielded a high grade of copper and,
later, uranium — neither of which turned out to be very easy to

A (forgettable) Kodak moment
In 1937, Harold Anthony of the American Museum of Natural History decided to boldly
go where he thought no man had ever gone before: to Shiva Temple, which he believed
was completely isolated from the rest of the canyon. Rather than the independently
evolved animal species he and his expedition expected to find there, however, they
discovered only an empty Kodak film box.

transport, although the mine stayed open until 1966. The Powell
Memorial at Powell Point pays tribute to one-armed Civil War vet-
eran John Wesley Powell, who, in 1869, set out to document the
then-uncharted canyons and creeks of the Colorado River (which,
ironically, you can’t see all that well from here). You can, however,
get a good look at the river from Hopi Point, where you can also
stare out at exotically named formations, such as the Tower of Ra
and Osiris, Isis, and Shiva temples.
During a lull in the whirring of the video cams at Mohave Point,
you may be able to hear the rushing waters of the Hermit Rapids.
You can also see the Granite and Salt Creek rapids from here, along
with the 5,401-foot-high Cheops Pyramid. Although the other over-
looks have you concentrating on the panoramic vistas, The Abyss
lives up to its name by demonstrating the utter sheerness of the
cliffs — specifically, the Great Mohave Wall, which drops 3,000 feet
(definitely a handrail gripper). At Pima Point, you can see the
remains of Hermit Camp, a tourist complex built by the Santa Fe
Railway in 1911. The camp got its supplies via aerial tramway —
which was also once used to ship a Ford to the bottom of the
canyon.
The drive ends at Hermits Rest, named for Louis Boucher, a French-
Canadian prospector who wasn’t nearly as reclusive as his nickname
suggests. Views of Hermit Rapids and the Supai and Redwall cliffs
compete for your attention with a striking log-and-stone structure,
designed by Mary Colter, which sells souvenirs and snacks — and
has the drive’s only restrooms.
A leisurely round-trip drive of the Hermits Rest Route, with a rest
stop at Hermits Rest itself, takes no more than one hour — unless
you plan to set up a tripod at each stop.
The Hermits Rest Route doesn’t exit the park; you have to retrace
your journey. Because access to the overlooks is easy from both
sides of the road, save half the stops for your return trip.
 Driving the Desert View route: Most of this 23-mile drive is open
to cars year-round except its first stop (if you’re departing from
Grand Canyon Village), Yaki Point, which is closed to traffic from

Rock stars
The tilted stratum of bright red, black, and white rocks at Lipan Point is part of a sed-
imentary rock sequence called the Grand Canyon Supergroup. The stratum goes back
about a billion years (even longer than the Rolling Stones). And talk about your rebels:
The supergroup’s relation to the straighter sandstone layer that hangs over it is called
the Great Unconformity.

March through December. If you want to see the Point during this
time, you need to take a shuttle, which many hikers do in order to
pick up the South Kaibab Trail, one of the three routes to the Inner
Gorge. Wotan’s Throne, an imposing flat-topped butte, is the look-
out’s most distinctive landmark. Large stands of oak, juniper, and
Ponderosa and piñon pine flourish at Grandview Point, which sits
at a higher elevation than most of the Desert View route. From there
you can see Horseshoe Mesa, where, in the 1890s, the Last Chance
Copper Mine and the Grand View Hotel both thrived. Painter
Thomas Moran was especially fond of the light from Moran Point,
which was named after him because his illustrations of the journals
of John Wesley Powell helped convince Congress to establish the
Grand Canyon as a national park. The free Tusayan Museum, built
in 1932, explains the significance of the remains of the small pueblo
nearby — one of 2,000 prehistoric Native American sites in the park.
Take the time to walk around here for a bit. The museum provides a
nice, educational break from the old drive-stop-stare routine.
From the canyon’s widest vista, Lipan Point, you get a fix on 
both geologic and human history. Views include colored strata of
sedimentary rock and the Unkar Delta, farmed by the ancestral
Puebloan peoples (often called Anasazi) around 800 years ago.
Spanish conquistadors tried to get down to the Colorado River
from Navajo Point in 1540 but couldn’t manage the trip (then again,
they couldn’t find the seven gold cities that originally brought them
to the area, either). The last, and arguably most dramatic vista of
both drives, is Desert View. Pay a quarter to climb the 70-foot-high
Watchtower and you see the Painted Desert, San Francisco Peaks,
Marble Canyon, and the Colorado River spread out before you. But
don’t worry if you don’t want to climb the tower’s steps: You’re at
the highest point of the South Rim, 7,522 feet, so the views from the
ground are nothing to sneeze at, either. The first stop when you enter
from the east, the Desert View complex includes an information
center, cafeteria, and (not open in winter) a gas station. Top-quality
Native American paintings and crafts are sold in the rough-hewn
Desert View building, shaped like a sacred ceremonial chamber.
Mary Colter (see the “Grand Canyon architecture: A woman’s 
touch” sidebar in this chapter) designed both Desert View and the
Watchtower.
Most people drive the Desert View route one way, either on the way
into or out of the park. Assuming that you make 30-minute stops at
both the Tusayan Museum and at Desert View, the drive takes at
least one and three quarter hours one-way; two and a half hours if
you retrace the path (you can’t drive quickly on these roads, both
because of speed limits and a need to watch out for drivers mes-
merized by the canyon views).

which is also where the transportation desks for booking them are

Photo op pros and cons
Helicopters fly 500 feet lower than small planes and have large bubble windows all
around, which means excellent visibility for photographers. Helicopter hovering — as
opposed to plane banking and dipping — provides better shots, too. But not everyone
in a helicopter is guaranteed a window seat, something passengers on small planes
(which have windows designed to minimize glare) enjoy. Ultimately, if you’re not shy
about leaning over someone should you be seated in the middle, the helicopter will
probably allow you to take your best shot.

children.
All the companies offer combination land/air options, and some offer land/air/water
possibilities. In 2006, a “temporary” fuel surcharge was in effect for almost all the tours
(some just bumped up their prices).

Grand Sunset Tour (three hours; $104 adults, $84 child), another forest-
rim combo; and the 90-minute Indian Cave Paintings Tour ($45 adult, $35
child), which never leaves the trees, but gives you a close-up view of
ancient art. You can mix and match these tours and add air components.
Misleading company name aside — they don’t use Jeeps but larger four-
wheel-drive vehicles, and you’re unlikely to spot many animals beside
deer or elk — these trips give you a feel for what a pre-automobile
approach to the canyon might have been like.
Bird’s-eye views: Flying over the canyon
Your comfort level with small planes and helicopters — not to mention
with spending lots of cash in a flash — determines whether an air tour is
for you. Plane crashes have occurred in the years since flights over the
canyon started, but the overall safety records are good. Helicopters are
more expensive than small planes, but the relative smoothness and sta-
bility of the flights may make it worth the extra cost for you. All flights
depart from the Grand Canyon Airport in Tusayan.

I’ve heard rumors that people watch the film Grand Canyon — The Hidden

park, something I’m still scratching my head over. Nonetheless, the six-

Grand Canyon architecture: 
A woman’s touch
Sure, you come here to bond with nature, but you can gaze into the middle distance
only for so long. The Grand Canyon Village Historical District, with its wonderful archi-
tecture from the classic High Tourist era — otherwise known as the first three decades
of the 1900s — is definitely worth a wander-through. Pick up a self-guided tour
brochure at the visitor center to find out about the nine artfully rustic structures: Hotels,
curio shops, photography studios, and the 1909 railway depot, which is back in use.
Verkamps Curios, opened in 1898 as the Grand Canyon’s first trinket shop, still looks
pretty much as it did in 1905, and the Kolb studio, built between 1904 and 1926, was
the domain of two brothers who captured early shots of the mule-passengers.
Hopi House, Bright Angel Lodge, and Lookout Studio are prime examples of the work
of Mary Colter, who was also responsible for Hermits Rest, Desert View, and
Watchtower. Her designs, which mesh beautifully with the landscape, were ahead of
their time — as was the very fact that Colter was a designing woman.

hour 365 days a year (Mar–Oct 8:30 a.m.–8:30 p.m., Nov–Feb 10:30 a.m.–
6:30 p.m.); tickets cost $10 adults, $7 ages 6 to 12, kids 5 and under are
free.
Active views: Getting down in the canyon
Not content with admiring the canyon at a distance? Travelers who
prefer the up-close-and-personal approach have a few options, from
hiking to riding to rafting.
 Hiking: You don’t necessarily have to spend the night in the
canyon in order to appreciate it (although some people may dis-
agree with me). If you’re in good shape, though, I urge you to at
least attempt a short trek below the rim, both to escape the crowds
and to get up close and personal with some of the fauna and flora
(don’t worry, unless you’re near the bottom, it won’t be cactus).
If you want to sleep down deep, contact the Backcountry
Reservations Office, Grand Canyon National Park, P.O. Box 129,
Grand Canyon, AZ 86023 (% 928-638-7875 [call between 1–5 p.m.,
Mountain standard time, Mon–Fri], or 928-638-7888 [automated
information line, with a long, complicated phone menu]; fax
928-638-2125; www.nps.gov/grca/backcountry), to request an
overnight permit ($10 per permit, plus $5 per person per night),
required unless you’re booked at Phantom Ranch. Call to have
backcountry information mailed to you or check the national park’s
Web site. Don’t wait until the last minute — eager backpackers typi-
cally snap up many of the limited amount of permits four months in
advance, which is the farthest ahead you can book. If you arrive
without a permit, but want to take a shot at getting one, head over
to the Backcountry Information Center (Mon–Fri 8 a.m.–noon and
1–5 p.m.), at the Maswik Transportation Center, and sign on to the
daily waiting list.
• Easy hikes: A level 10-mile-long trail runs along the edge of
the canyon from the Yavapai Observation Station (northeast
of Grand Canyon Village) west to Hermits Rest. If you want to
plan your walk, check The Guide for the distances between
the various lookout points. The short and mostly flat rim trek
around the historic buildings of Grand Canyon Village is also
easy and scenic; see the “Grand Canyon architecture: A
woman’s touch” sidebar in this chapter for more details. The
Canyon View Information Plaza can clue you in about other
short hikes, including options along the Greenway, a network
of walking, cycling, and eventually, horseback riding trails
being developed in and around the national park.
• Hard hikes: Originally a bighorn sheep path and later used
by the Havasupai Indians, Bright Angel Trail is the most pop-
ular route into the canyon. Almost 8 miles long, the trail
descends 4,460 feet from the trailhead near Grand Canyon
Village to the river at Phantom Ranch. From May through
Chapter 17: The Grand Canyon and Northwest Arizona 377

September, drinking water is usually available at the 1.5- and
3-mile rest houses — good goals for a 3- and 6-mile hike,
respectively. The 4.6-mile point (Indian Garden) always has
water. The 9-mile-long Hermit Trail begins beyond Hermits
Rest and drops more than 5,000 feet to Hermit Creek. This
trail is steep, nonmaintained, and waterless; don’t try it
unless you’re a serious hiker (it’s 5 miles round-trip to Santa
Maria Spring, 6 miles round-trip to Dripping Springs). Also
strenuous (and waterless), but rewarding for its terrific views
is the South Kaibab Trail, which you can pick up at Yaki
Point; it’s a 7-mile trek from the trailhead to the Colorado
River (where the trail crosses a suspension bridge and runs
on to Phantom Ranch). The 3-mile round-trip to Cedar Ridge,
which has portable toilets but no water, is a good goal for a
decent day’s hike.
Remember, the only way to get to Yaki Point most of the year
is by shuttle. If you miss the shuttle, however, you can call a
taxi (see the “Getting around” section earlier under the “The
South Rim of the Grand Canyon” section) to come and retrieve
you. You find a pay phone at the South Kaibab trailhead (even
if you have a cellphone, a signal is difficult to get).

Some hiking tips
You may be surprised how many generally sensible people leave their common sense
behind when they descend into the canyon. To avoid discomfort — and worse — here
are a few basics to keep in mind:
 Remember, what goes down must come up: And that means you. For every hour
you hike downhill, allow two hours (and lots of huffing and puffing, if you’re out of
shape) for the return.
 Wear comfortable shoes with good traction: Hiking boots are best, but rough-
soled sneakers or walking shoes are okay, too.
 Always carry enough food and drink: In summer, 2 quarts of electrolyte replace-
ment fluid is minimum, and 1 gallon is recommended for every eight hours of
hiking. Munch on nutritious, high-carb, salty snacks every 20 to 30 minutes.
 Layer your clothing: The temperature climbs up the farther down you go; be pre-
pared for rain and snow in winter.
 Check your copy of The Guide before you attempt a hike: The 4-H list of hiking
hazards (heat stroke, heat exhaustion, hyponatremia [water intoxication], and
hypothermia) may send you running to the IMAX theater for a virtual descent,
instead.

 Mule rides: For many, visiting the Grand Canyon without riding a
mule would be like visiting Yellowstone without seeing Old Faithful
(of course, for others, riding a mule into the canyon would be like
sitting and getting soaked in Old Faithful for six hours). If you think
you’re in the former category, plan ahead. For some summer dates,
rides get booked up as much as a year in advance
Your choices include a seven-hour, round-trip ride to Plateau Point,
with lunch at Indian Gardens ($142 per person). For the 51⁄2-mile
ride down to Phantom Ranch, with a 41⁄2-mile return the next day,
see the “Miles to go before you sleep” sidebar in this chapter. For
advance reservations, contact Grand Canyon National Lodges
(% 888-29-PARKS or 303-29-PARKS; www.grandcanyonlodges.
com). If you didn’t book but decide at the last minute to give mule
riding a shot — occasionally folks don’t show up — call % 928-638-
2631 or stop by the Bright Angel Transportation desk to put your
name on a waiting list for the next day’s ride.
Be aware that you aren’t allowed to ride a mule if you:
• Weigh more than 200 pounds
• Are less than 4’7” tall
• Are pregnant
• Don’t speak English
• Are rude to the tour operators (just checking to see if you’re
paying attention, although who knows?)
And, don’t ride if you
• Are afraid of heights
• Are afraid of large animals (the mule is the love child of a
female horse and a male donkey, and it’s often bigger than 
a horse; don’t confuse it with the smaller burro)
• Have heart or respiratory problems
• Don’t think you can sit in a saddle for at least six hours, or go
two and a half hours without a bathroom break
 Horseback rides: Less stressful and less expensive than the mule
tours, rides run by Apache Stables, Highway 64 (just before the
south entrance to the park; % 928-638-2891; www.apachestables.
com), don’t dip into the canyon; most, in fact, don’t even enter the
national park. You trot around Kaibab National Forest during the
one-hour ($31), two-hour ($56), and campfire ($41 by trail, $13 in a
wagon) rides. Age and weight restrictions apply, except for the camp-
fire wagon ride. The stables are usually open from March to early
December, but sometimes close earlier or open later, depending on
the weather. Both mules and horses are used, so when you get home
you can say you rode a mule at the canyon, which is essentially true,
if you don’t get hung up on phrases like “down into” as opposed to
“around.”
Chapter 17: The Grand Canyon and Northwest Arizona 379

 River rafting: The options for getting wet ’n’ wild on the Colorado
River are almost as dizzying as the rapids you’re bound to encounter.
You can do everything from paddling your own canoe to zipping
along on a motorized raft on trips ranging from three days to almost
three weeks. You may be happy to discover that not every Joe
Schmo with an air pump can run river trips into the Grand Canyon;
the National Park Service authorizes only outfitters with good cre-
dentials. You can get the most current listings by writing ahead for
the Trip Planner (for the address, see the following “Fast Facts: The
South Rim” section) or by clicking on www.nps.gov/grca/river.
Most of the outfitters run trips from April to October and most
depart from Lees Ferry near Page, although some start or finish at
Phantom Ranch. Expect to pay anywhere from around $875 (includ-
ing meals and tent) for a three-day trip to approximately $3,600 for
two weeks on the water. Book as far in advance as possible; the
rafts fill up fast and not too many people bail after they sign on.
Don’t do white water? See Chapter 18 for smooth-water trips from
Glen Canyon Dam in Page to Lees Ferry. If, on the other hand, you
want to make the trip all on your own, contact the River Permits

The canyon for kids
If your kids can’t relate to nature that’s not on a screen, don’t worry — they get into it
soon enough (just give that mouse hand a little time to stop twitching). Some quick
ways to get the Internet set on line with the canyon include the following:
 Have them take part in the Junior Ranger program. This program gears its activ-
ities to everything from finding animal tracks to recycling aluminum cans. The pro-
gram is available to three age groups — 4 to 7, 8 to 10, and 11 to 14. Kids who
successfully complete five steps get a Junior Ranger Patch. Be sure to start early
to give kids time to complete the program. Ask at the visitor center for details.
 Buy them a disposable camera. Beware: You may create a photography monster.
 Take them to watch the mules set off in the morning. The mules begin their jour-
neys (8 a.m. in summer, 9 a.m. in winter) from the corral just west of Bright Angel
Lodge (and yes, let them tell poop jokes).
 Bring them to one of the kid-oriented ranger talks and walks. These activities
are offered daily in summer, less frequently off season; check The Guide for meet-
ing times.
 Put them on horseback. The Apache Stables, just before park’s south entrance,
has gentle animals that are used to kiddie ways.
 Take them to the IMAX. Hey, if you can’t beat ’em (and you really shouldn’t), 
join ’em.

Safety
The safety concerns in the Grand Canyon
are less linked to crime than to people
ignoring the fact that they’re in nature, not
Disneyland. (If you want to read all about
the various stupidity- and testosterone-
driven deaths, pick up a copy of Over The
Edge: Death in the Grand Canyon.) Although
theft may not be a major problem, don’t put
your expensive camera down and walk
away or amble around with your purse
open. In short, don’t leave your common
sense at home.
Part IV: Exploring the Regions 
382
The North Rim of the Grand 
Canyon (and More)
Let me hit you with a few statistics. The North Rim of the Grand Canyon
gets only about one-tenth of the visitors of the South Rim. That doesn’t
mean you find yourself entirely alone — I’m talking one-tenth of about
4.5 million, and it’s estimated that each year, 5 percent more visitors
descend on this side of the great northern Arizona divide than the year
before (I’ll let you do the math; it was never my best subject).
Why the disparity in the number of people visiting the different national
park sections? One simple reason: The North Rim is harder to reach
than the South Rim. This means that fewer services and hotel rooms are
available after you arrive, so you have to plan ahead. But the North Rim
views are as good as those at the South Rim, so if you prefer bonding
with nature to bonding with (or bouncing off) your fellow Homo sapiens,
the effort is worth it, no question.
You won’t find a whole lot to do in the remote, starkly beautiful region
that you drive through en route to the North Rim, nor in the Arizona
Strip, the even more remote area to the west of the canyon. However, 
a few stops make good diversions.
Plan to linger a bit in this area — a minimum of two nights to make it
worth the trip. If your pulse gets pumping at the idea of river rafting or 
if you’re hooked on fishing, spend some more time at Lees Ferry, the
departure point for the Colorado River adventures.
The North Rim doesn’t have any ATMs inside the park. Credit cards are
accepted at most of the park’s facilities, but having a little of the green
stuff is always good, so stop for cash at Jacob’s Lake if you’re short.
More important, the closest pharmacy to the national park is in Kanab,
Utah, so come prepared with any medications you may need.
The North Rim is open for overnight stays only from mid-May to mid- or
late October (day use continues through Nov — or until the first heavy
snow).

Getting there
Except for the shuttle from the South Rim — more on this subject in the
“By shuttle” section — the North Rim doesn’t have public transportation.
By car
The distance from Flagstaff to the North Rim is 207 miles: Take Highway
89 north to Bitter Springs, then Highway 89A to the junction of Highway
67 at Jacob Lake, and take Highway 67 south to the North Rim. The drive
is spectacular.
Flying into Page (see Chapter 18) is an even better option if you can
afford the airfare: A scenic 25-mile drive south on Highway 89 gets you 
to Bitter Springs/Highway 89A, hooking you up with the Flagstaff route
sketched above.
You can also get here from Las Vegas, a total of 264 miles. Take I-15 
east to Highway 9, then head east to Highway 89. Take that south to
Highway 89A, where you’ll follow the Flagstaff route again.
By shuttle
From mid-May to October, the Transcanyon Shuttle (% 928-638-2820)
makes one round-trip a day between the North and South rims. Vans
depart the North Rim’s Grand Canyon Lodge (or the campground or a
trailhead if you put in a special request) at 7 a.m., arriving at the South
Rim’s Bright Angel Lodge at 11:30 a.m.; the return shuttle leaves at 
1:30 p.m., reaching the North Rim at 6 p.m. The one-way fare is $70 per
person; round-trips cost $130. Reservations are required.
Chapter 17: The Grand Canyon and Northwest Arizona 383
Northern exposure: Getting 
to know the “other” rim
Some things are worth going out of your way for — among them, the Grand Canyon’s
North Rim. Just so you know what you’re getting (or at least looking) into:
 At about 8,000 feet, the North Rim is approximately 1,000 feet higher than the South
Rim.
 The North Rim receives about 27 inches of rain or snow annually, compared to 15
inches for the South Rim.
 Europeans took 236 years longer to find the North Rim than to find the South Rim:
1776 versus 1540.
 The land that the North Rim sits on was hotly contested by Utah and Arizona. A
journalist named Sharlot Hall helped convince Arizonans to go to bat for the abyss.

Getting around
You mostly have to rely on your own wheels to get around the park. 
The exception is the hiker shuttle to the North Kaibab trailhead, which
leaves from the front of the Grand Canyon Lodge every day at 5:20 a.m.
and 7:20 a.m. You need to buy tickets in advance from the lodge’s front
desk; the cost is $5 for the first person, $2 for each additional one.
Spending the night
You’re not exactly spoiled by choices when it comes to rooming near the
North Rim. Only one place is available in the park itself; two more lodg-
ing options are within a 30-mile radius; and an additional three are near
Lees Ferry — all are detailed in the following section. Rooms in this area
are modest, but that goes for the prices, too. And these lodgings, espe-
cially the ones in Lees Ferry, tend to generate outpost-style camaraderie;
don’t be surprised if you make new friends here.
Inside the park
Grand Canyon Lodge
$–$$
On the rim
The Grand Canyon Lodge is the only game in this part of the national park,
but you’d want to play even if it weren’t. Of the variety of lodgings avail-
able here, the Western cabins are closest to the rim and the most luxuri-
ous (the four that actually look into the canyon are usually booked as far
in advance as it’s permissible to book). The Pioneer and Frontier cabins,
although the most rustic, are right near the Transept Trail. The motel
rooms are standard issue and farthest from the lodge, but all have queen-
size beds (the others have doubles and singles). But you won’t spend
much time in your room. When you’re not out exploring the canyon, you’ll
want to hang around the historic log-and-limestone lodge, where a high-
ceiling dining room serves surprisingly sophisticated food that (almost)
competes with the rim views from its huge windows. The bar, cafeteria,
gift shop, and transportation desk are the other prime congregating spots.

Outside the park
You come across a few low-key motels in Fredonia, Arizona, and Kanab,
Utah (30 and 37 miles west of Jacob Lake, respectively), but they’re a bit
out of the way if you’re not heading north. Page, near Lake Powell, offers
plenty more beds (see Chapter 18), but doing a single-day round-trip to
the park from there isn’t very relaxing — and kicking back and smelling
the pine cones is what the North Rim is all about. If you’re not staying at
the Grand Canyon Lodge, the following places offer good alternatives.

Cliff Dweller’s Lodge

Lees Ferry/Marble Canyon
The rooms are fine — the newer, blander, slightly pricier ones have bath-
tubs, the older ones have only showers but more character — but the
Vermilion Cliff and Echo Cliff surroundings make this place a knockout.
Not surprisingly, most of the action happens outside; you can book a
hiking tour in summer, or go next door to a river outfitter to plan a water
adventure. If you don’t feel like socializing with the river runners in the
good bar and restaurant (see the following “Dining locally,” section), you
can stock up on booze and snacks in the hotel’s convenience store.

Kaibab Lodge

Near the park entrance
A huge stone fireplace, sometimes lit in spring and early fall, makes a
cheery gathering spot for guests at this homey 1926 lodge. Most of the
rooms, located in (rather thin-walled) pine-paneled cabins, are motel plain
and offer only bare-bones facilities; a couple of newer, larger units have
modern conveniences like refrigerators and microwaves. But the real draw
is the setting, near the national park and the edge of the large DeMotte
Park meadow. Other perks include a restaurant, lounge (beer and wine
only), and gift shop.

Jacob Lake Inn

Jacob Lake
This inn is where the action — if you can call it that — is en route to the
North Rim. Everyone heading for the national park stops here for gro-
ceries, gas, Native American crafts, a hot chicken sandwich, or fresh baked
cookies and milkshakes (hey, you need fortification for the long ride).
Spend the night and either bunk in a shabby cabin with a private porch or
in one of the nicer drive-up motel units. The complex sits on 5 acres of
Kaibab Forest, but many of the rooms look out on a highway. If you want
a good night’s sleep, ask for accommodations behind the lodge.

congregate — but the views of the Vermilion Cliffs from the garden patios
are completely on the up and up (and up). Rooms in this 1929 native-stone-

Santa Monica freeway — and their plumbing is a bit noisy, but they have
plenty of nice touches. See the Vermilion Cliffs Bar & Grill in the follow-

wood floors, but an apartment there sleeps up to eight. You can ease your

Dining locally
You pretty much eat where you sleep near the North Rim (I don’t mean
that literally, unless you take your munchies to bed. The North Rim defi-
nitely isn’t room-service country). That’s not generally a bad thing,
though. This area is too remote for the fast-food franchises, so most of the
chow is of the hearty, home-cooked variety. The best — also the only —
gourmet food in the area is at the dining room of the Grand Canyon
Lodge ($$–$$$), where classic American fare is sometimes given a
Southwestern spin (chiles, blue corn). You have to make a reservation to
eat there; call as soon as you book a room. Among the low-key eateries in
the area, the standouts are the Canyon Dreamers Cafe ($$) at the Cliff
Dweller’s Lodge, which makes its desserts and soups from scratch and
brews a mean espresso; and the Vermilion Cliffs Bar & Grill ($$–$$$) at
Lees Ferry Lodge, where the beer is cold, your steak is cooked the way
you order it, and the fish is fresh from the river. I haven’t dined on any-
thing but cookies at the Jacob Lake Inn, but I hear the jagerschnitzel 
is good.
Exploring the North Rim
Without the glut of concessionaires that converge on the South Rim,
exploring the chasm’s northern reaches is a much more personal, and
Part IV: Exploring the Regions 
386

usually more tranquil, experience. No helicopters hover here and few
tour operators are around to guide you — it’s just you, your car, and a
few road signs.
As soon as you drive up to the entry kiosks and pay your park fee — the
same as that on the South Rim, and nada if you’ve already paid in that
busier part of the park less than a week ago (see the “Entering the park”
section earlier in this chapter) — a gate attendant hands you a North
Rim version of The Guide. Use it early and often. The park rangers and
Grand Canyon Association employees at the North Rim Visitor Center,
near the Grand Canyon Lodge (% 928-638-7864), can probably answer
any other questions you may have. The center is open from 8 a.m. to 
5 p.m. daily, sometimes longer in summer.
Rim drives
About 8 miles to the north of the Grand Canyon Lodge, the only road in
the area forks off in two directions. Veer right (a sign reminds you) and
drive another 3 miles to Point Imperial, the highest vista point on either
rim at 8,803 feet. From there you can see the Painted Desert to the east,
the Vermilion Cliffs to the north, Utah’s Navajo Mountain to the north-
east, and the Little Colorado River gorge to the southeast.
Turn left at the fork to reach Cape Royal, a total of 23 miles from the
Grand Canyon Lodge. From the parking lot at the road’s end, Cape Royal is
a short (one third mile each way), piñon-pine-lined walk to some of the
most awe-inspiring vistas in the park. Angel’s Window, a giant, erosion-
formed hole, is carved into a rock outcropping along the rim. Peer
through the opening below the formation to catch a slice of the lower
canyon, including a ribbon-like Colorado River. (For a nice walk from here,
see the Cliff Springs Trail under the following section.) En route, stop at
the Wallhalla Overlook to see the remains of two ancestral Puebloan vil-
lages, and at Roosevelt Point, where you get an angle on the spot where
the Little Colorado River gorge and the Grand Canyon converge.
Hikes
The North Rim has fewer maintained hiking trails than the South Rim,
but, then, you won’t have to share them with as many other people.
Check with the visitor center — see the “Fast Facts: The North Rim” sec-
tion at the end of this chapter — for other suggestions. Before attempt-
ing the longer walks, see the “Some hiking tips” sidebar, earlier in this
chapter.
 Easy hikes: The most popular North Rim hike because it starts just
behind the Grand Canyon Lodge (pick it up at the corner of the east
patio), the half-mile (round-trip) walk to Bright Angel Point is also
one of the most breathtaking — literally. You stroll along a skinny
peninsula that divides Roarings Springs and Transept canyons,
with sheer drops just a few feet away on either side (don’t worry if,
Chapter 17: The Grand Canyon and Northwest Arizona 387

like me, you get weak-kneed just thinking about that; you can grab
onto metal railings at the narrowest parts).
Bright Angel Point seems to deprive some shutterbugs of their
common sense. Don’t climb any dangerous ledges to try for your
best shot — it could be your last.
Feel like a walk in the woods? The spot where you picked up the
Bright Angel Point trail also marks the start of the 3-mile (round-
trip) Transept Trail. This one edges the rim for a bit before plung-
ing into the Ponderosa pine forest, winding past a small ancestral
Puebloan ruin, and ending up at the North Rim Campground and
General Store.
You also see signs of the canyon’s earlier inhabitants — the ones
who preceded Homo hikus — on the Cliff Springs Trail, the 1-mile
(round-trip) path through a forested ravine that begins at Angel’s
Window Overlook: About a quarter mile from the trailhead are the
remains of an ancient granary. Narrow and precipitous where it
hugs the north side of the Cliff Springs Canyon (if you’re scared of
heights, pass this one up), the trail winds beneath several lime-
stone overhangs before reaching Cliff Springs (and no, you can’t
drink the water).
 Hard(er) hikes: The only maintained trail to the bottom of the
canyon from the North Rim, the North Kaibab Trail, which hooks
up with the South Kaibab Trail (see the “Exploring the South Rim”
section earlier in this chapter), is 14.4 miles long each way and
descends nearly 6,000 feet before it reaches the Colorado River.
Unless you’re on the Olympic hiking team (is there even such a
thing?), you won’t be able to finish this trail in a day, but hiking
part of it is a great way to dip below the rim and see Roaring
Springs and Bright Angel canyons, among other things.
The drive is just 11⁄2 miles round-trip to Coconino Overlook, a sand-
stone clearing in a thick forest of aspen, Douglas fir, and gambel
oak, but this stretch has lots of switchbacks. Supai Tunnel, about 
2 miles from the trailhead, is an ideal turnaround point if you’re
more ambitious but don’t want to push yourself; you find water and
restrooms here. You’d better be in really good shape — almost
Olympic hiking team material — and head out very early if you
want to reach Roaring Springs, the water source for both rims, and
back. The 10-mile (round-trip) hike can take up to eight hours.
Spending the night down in the canyon requires a backcountry
permit; see the “Exploring the South Rim” section earlier in this
chapter for details.

book (prices run about $745 per person for a three-day adventure).
Part IV: Exploring the Regions

Mule rides
They’re not as famous as their South Rim siblings — partly because of
the area’s lower profile, partly because they don’t go the distance (to the
bottom) — but the mules at the North Rim give the folks who hire them
a good run (or at least trot) for their money. And the menu of options at
Grand Canyon Trail Rides, at the Grand Canyon Lodge (% 435-679-
8665, ext. 222 preseason; 928-638-9875 after May 15 and until the North
Rim closes in late fall), is larger. Every day from May 15 until the North
Rim closes, options include: one-hour rim rides (for ages 7 and older) for
$30; half-day trips — one stays on the rim, the other goes down to Supai
Tunnel on the North Kaibab Trail — for $65 (minimum age 10); and full-
day trips (minimum age 12) down to Roaring Springs for $125, lunch
included. These rides don’t need to be booked as far in advance as the
rides on the South Rim, but they’re popular. Call or go to the transporta-
tion desk of the lodge as soon as you decide when you want to ride.
Touring beyond the North Rim
The road to the North Rim may be less traveled, but it’s definitely not
boring. The scenery is amazing, and you can get in some fishing if you’re
so inclined. Also beautiful is the Arizona Strip country, northwest of 
the national park. Two small towns (Fredonia and Colorado City), the
Kaibab-Pauite reservation, and a national monument (the only place to
do anything, really) punctuate this isolated area.
En route to the North Rim
As you drive north from Flagstaff on Highway 89, you see the Painted
Desert, windswept plains and mesas colored with every pastel in the
spectrum, to the east. The sandstone Echo Cliffs, with a more limited
palate (soft pink to burnt umber), start putting in an appearance about
30 miles beyond the Cameron Trading Post (see the “Spending the night”
section in “The South Rim of the Grand Canyon section earlier in this
chapter). You can’t miss them: Some are more than 1,000 feet tall. But
the views get even grander. Keep going west from Navajo Bridge rather
than detouring to Lees Ferry and you encounter the bright Vermilion
Cliffs, topping off at more than 3,000 feet and with boulders surreally
Chapter 17: The Grand Canyon and Northwest Arizona 389
Some restrictions apply
In addition to the age minimums for the North Rim mule riders (I think different ones
probably apply to the mules), weight and language rules apply. You can’t weigh more
than 220 pounds if you want to go around the rim or more than 200 if you’d like to dip
into the canyon, and you have to speak English (sorry, the mules aren’t bilingual).

balanced on eroded columns of soil. Stop at the San Bartolome Historic
Site overlook to read about the 1776 Domínguez-Escalante expedition
through this area or just to look at the scenery standing still (you, not
the scenery). After you’re on the road again, you begin to see forest
rather than desert; you know you’re climbing the Kaibab Plateau, more
than 9,000 feet at its highest point.
Other high (and low) points of this region include the following:
 Spanning the canyon: Listed on the National Register of Historic
Places, the 834-foot-long steel Navajo Bridge, built in 1929, was the
first — and, until the bridge at Glen Canyon Dam was built in 1959,
the only — way to get across the Grand Canyon. Before this time,
no other bridge crossed the Colorado River for the 600 miles from
Moab, Utah, to the Hoover Dam. You can find out all about the
bridge at the Native American-staffed Navajo Bridge Interpretive
Center (% 928-355-2319). Keep an eye out for the building on your
right, just beyond the new bridge (that’s the one you drive across;
the old one is pedestrian-only now). The building is hard to see
because the native sandstone structure blends in beautifully with
the Vermilion Cliffs backdrop. Pick up topographic maps, postcards,
and books about the Grand Canyon, Lake Powell, Lees Ferry, and
other area attractions at the center (admission: free; May 15–Oct 15
daily 8 a.m.–5 p.m.). Outside, vendors usually sell Native American
jewelry.
 Trouting around: On a sharp bend in the Colorado River where the
Echo Cliffs break — look for the turnoff just beyond Navajo Bridge on
Highway 89A — Lees Ferry was long known as the river crossing for
Mormon pioneers. Now Lees Ferry is famed for being mile zero —
the coordinate from which all distances on the river system are
measured. Straddling Glen Canyon upstream and Marble Canyon
(the beginning of the Grand Canyon) downstream, Lees Ferry is also
the point of departure for most Grand Canyon river rafting trips.
Serious trout-fishers like to spend time here because trophy-sized
specimens often take the bait. You can pick up fishing gear and a
guide at Lees Ferry Anglers, Marble Canyon, 3 miles west of Navajo
Part IV: Exploring the Regions 
390
Some flighty California transplants
Don’t be surprised if you see a California condor in the Vermilion Cliffs area. Several
pairs of the endangered birds were released in this area from 1996 through 1997 — 
no doubt because they look just mahr-velous swooping against those cliffs (and, 
okay, because they lived here in prehistoric times). You can find out who’s mating with
whom, which chicks have flown the coop, and get other condor news online at www.
peregrinefund.org, in the “Notes from the Field” section.

Marble Canyon Outfitters, Marble Canyon Lodge (% 800-533-7339

Rates range from about $300 for one person to $500 for three people
for a full day. Prices may be lower if you meet the guide by the river
rather than at the outfitter’s shop.
 Oh, give me a home: Arizona’s largest herd of American bison
roam around the House Rock Buffalo Ranch, operated by the
Arizona Department of Game and Fish’s wildlife division (% 602-
942-3000; www.gf.state.az.us/hf/gamebuffalo.shtml). On
Highway 89A, about 17 miles west of Marble Canyon, is the turnoff
for the 23-mile dirt road that leads to the ranch house (which is pri-
vate, and has no interpretive center or other public facilities). Don’t
be disappointed if you don’t see any buffalo, however. The ranch is
huge (58,000 acres), and the 75 to 100 shaggy behemoths don’t
always cooperate by coming within photo-op distance of your car
(which can be a good thing: those babies are big but move fast and
en masse). You’re likely to see antelope, mule deer, and jackrabbits,
though. Note: This drive isn’t a good idea if you don’t have a high
clearance or four-wheel-drive vehicle, especially in the rain or
snow. And the buffalo are, literally, fair game — public hunts have
been held at the ranch since the 1920s — so don’t phone the
authorities if you should spot someone aiming a rifle at them 
(you may phone if the rifle’s aimed at you, however).
West of the North Rim
If you don’t turn south toward the North Rim at Jacob Lake junction —
okay, so I’m being very hypothetical; why else would you drive all the
way up there? — you head into the Arizona Strip, the 12,000-square-mile
spread of northwest Arizona that has been dubbed the American Tibet,
and not because yaks live there. You can see hundreds of miles in all
directions on this lunar landscape, where lava outcroppings and cinder
cones rise up among the more familiar (by now) red-rock and sandstone
cliffs. The area is beautiful, but desolate; only some members of the
Kaibub Paiute tribe and a few Mormon families live out here. The area’s
sole two sightseeing possibilities:
Chapter 17: The Grand Canyon and Northwest Arizona 391
The original love boat
After ferry service was established at Lees Ferry (you knew the place had its name
for a reason, didn’t you?) in 1873, the landing became part of the Honeymoon Trail, fol-
lowed by Mormon couples who had tied the knot in Arizona but wanted their union
sanctified at the Temple of Latter-Day Saints in St. George, Utah.

 Discover water: Pipe Spring National Monument, 45 miles west of
Jacob Lake on Highway 389, Fredonia (% 928-643-7105), makes a
good, if surreally Midwestern-looking, break from all that surround-
ing desert. The site’s natural spring is one of the area’s few consis-
tent water sources. The Mormons built a fortress here in 1871, but
it soon became a dairy farm and Arizona territory’s first telegraph
station. Summer mornings feature living history exhibits. Admission
is $5 per adult and ages 15 and under are free. It’s open Memorial
Day to Labor Day 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.; the rest of the year, hours are 
8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tours are given on the hour and half hour from 9am
to 4 p.m. Closed Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year’s Day. See
map p. 337.
 Make rock art reservations: During the busy season, members 
of the Kaibab Paiute tribe, who have a small reservation in the
Arizona Strip, offer easy, guided hikes to nearby petroglyph sites
for $10 per person; in theory they’re offered regularly on weekday
mornings, by advance arrangement on the weekends. Reaching 
the tribal office by phone (% 928-643-7245) isn’t always easy, 
however; your best bet is to stop in at the office, which is on
Highway 389, just before the turn off to Pipe Spring National
Monument (see the preceding bullet).

T
he landscape of the Arizona northeast — of vast open spaces and
eerie rock formations — is the Arizona you see in your mind’s eye if,
like many, you’ve been raised on classic Western flicks. But this region is
more than just the rugged, photogenic face of a John Ford movie. Home
to the Navajo and Hopi and their ancestors, northeastern Arizona is also
the spiritual heart of the Southwest. Sound a little too somber for you?
Not to worry. You can play as hard here as anywhere else in the state,
whether you’re water-skiing on Lake Powell, hiking to see a cliff dwelling
at Navajo National Monument, or horsing around at the bottom of
Canyon de Chelly. And a key way to experience local culture, of course,
is shopping.
Time after time
Arizona is on a strange time trip: It’s in the Mountain Time zone, but it doesn’t observe
daylight saving time like most states. And time tracking gets even weirder in Northeast
Arizona. The Navajos do observe daylight saving time (which is only logical because
their reservation crosses into New Mexico and Utah), while the neighboring Hopi do
not. If you go from Page to Monument Valley to the Hopi Mesas, you theoretically have
to switch your watch three times. (You probably won’t have any pressing engagements
to worry about, though.)

Northeast Arizona
Chapter 18: Northeast Arizona: Hopi and Navajo Country 395

The only two places where you’re likely to want to linger are the Page/
Lake Powell area and the Canyon de Chelly region. Otherwise, your
sleepovers may pretty much be limited to one-night stands, although I
can see spending two nights at Goulding’s, a historic trading post/hotel
near Monument Valley. That said, you can easily enjoy at least a week
moving around this spectacular, spread-out region. Just prepare to forgo
some luxuries during your visit.
Navajo Nation Northwest
This part of the state has some of the country’s weirdest and most won-
derful scenery, including the series of wet ’n’ wild canyons that com-
prise Lake Powell; the skinny, strangely convoluted Antelope Canyon;
and the mounds and spires of Monument Valley that set the scene for
Westerns ranging from The Searchers to Thelma and Louise. The area is
also rich in cultural sites like the cliff dwellings at Navajo National
Monument and assorted historic trading posts. Plan on spending a mini-
mum of three days to give this area its due. In fact, if you enjoy playing
on the water and/or if you detour to the Grand Canyon’s North Rim (see
Chapter 17), you may decide to spend your entire vacation here.
Getting there
Traveling from Flagstaff to Page couldn’t be easier: Just keep driving
north on Highway 89 for 138 miles. When you reach Bitter Springs, where
Highway 89A branches off from Highway 89, continue on Highway 89;
Page is just 25 more miles up the road. The scenery along the way is eye-
popping (see Chapter 17 for details on the route to Bitter Springs). About
5 miles beyond the Bitter Springs turn-off, at mile marker 527, you come
to the Big Cut. Pull off the road to gaze at the sweeping vista of the
Vermilion Cliffs and the Colorado River canyon on the Marble Plateau
spread out below.
Part IV: Exploring the Regions 
396
You don’t need a passport, but . . .
Traveling on an American Indian reservation is similar to visiting a foreign country. The
Navajo Nation is the largest sovereign, self-governing community within U.S. bound-
aries. Both the Navajos and the Hopis have their own customs, laws, and even lan-
guages. (Relax; you won’t need an interpreter — but don’t be surprised if you hear the
Navajo language spoken.) For example, you don’t see any street addresses, because
there’s no house-to-house postal delivery; everyone retrieves mail from a P.O. box.
When in doubt about directions, just ask; locals are happy to help. You, in turn, are
expected to behave politely. (See the “Native American etiquette: Some reservation
do’s and don’ts” sidebar in this chapter.)

Great Lakes Aviation (% 800-554-5111; www.greatlakesav.com) has
three flights a day from Phoenix to Page Municipal Airport, 1 mile east 
of town on Highway 98 (% 928-645-2494), and offers one flight a week
from Page from Denver. Avis (% 800-331-1212 or 928-645-2024) and
Hertz (% 800-654-3131 or 928-645-1672) rent cars at the Page airport.
Spending the night
Most of the lodgings in this area are of the chain persuasion, but several
notable exceptions are available — including a historic trading post and
moveable rooms that aren’t on wheels. Unless I say otherwise, you may
expect to find a modest restaurant serving Navajo/American fare on all
the Navajo reservation properties.
Around Page/Lake Powell
The town of Page and Wahweap Marina at Lake Powell offer the best
beds in the region. National chains represented here include Best
Western (two of them, side by side), Comfort Inn, Day’s Inn & Suites,
Holiday Inn Express, Motel 6, Quality Inn, Super 8, and Travelodge
(see the appendix for the toll-free numbers). Several modest independ-
ent motels join their ranks on Lake Powell Boulevard, Page’s main drag,
and on 8th Avenue between Elm Street and South Navajo Drive, called
“Street of the Little Motels.” Look out, too, for lodgings at Antelope
Point, slated to be completed in 2007.
Book as far ahead as you can if you visit in spring or summer. In winter,
you enjoy your pick of rooms — and at very good prices.

This chain hotel has the fanciest bunks in Page and the Lake Powell

go ahead — join the houseboating hordes. Don’t worry if the closest you usually come
to things nautical is riding the Staten Island Ferry. These babies are easy (and fun) to

ing up to eight people) to $10,800 for a week on a luxurious 75-foot Admiral class model
(which sleeps up to 12).
But, recently, Antelope Point Marina (% 800-255-5561 or 480-998-1981 in Scottsdale;
www.lakepowellhouseboating.com) introduced two super-luxurious house-
boat models to Lake Powell. We’re talking a GPS tracking system, large-screen color
TVs with DVD players in each room, and a wet bar and hot tub on the upper deck.
Rates in high season range from $3,695 for a three-day stay on the 59-footer (sleeps
up to ten) to $8,495 for a week on the 70-foot model (sleeps up to 12).
For both companies, rates go down considerably in winter — but, unless you like play-
ing in cold water, so do your activity and comfort levels. Also, the more space you
share, the lower the per-person cost. Just make sure all of you really want to spend
that much time on a boat together.

Director John Ford’s former stomping ground is still a Hollywood magnet.
If you see a pickup truck commercial on TV with a big sky/big rocks back-

at Goulding’s. The rooms are comfortable, with freshened-up Southwest-
rustic decor and all the mod cons. An on-site museum details the history
of this former trading post, and a gift shop still has plenty of Native
American goods for sale. Other pluses include great craggy-cliffs views from
the balconies of many rooms, a tour desk, coin-op laundry, gas station, and
an airstrip (where else would Hollywood types land their Lear jets?).

Around Page/Lake Powell
Peppers ($$–$$$) in the Courtyard by Marriott (see the preceding
“Spending the night,” section) is a good place for breakfast; I also like 
to start my day at the Ranch House Grille ($), 819 North Navajo Dr.

In Monument Valley
The restaurants in the Monument Valley area aren’t vastly different from
one another. Expect reasonable versions of casual American dishes and
a few good Mexican and Navajo selections in Kayenta’s three motel
restaurants and at the Haskéneini dining room (named after an early-
20th-century Navajo leader) in Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park.
Haskéneini has great views but it’s small and gets really crowded in
summer. The dining room at Goulding’s is a cut above the rest in terms
of selection, quality, and view (although not necessarily service).
The entire Navajo Nation is dry; you can’t buy or bring any booze
(including beer and wine) onto the reservation.

The top attractions
Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park
Near Kayenta
The deep rust sandstone buttes, mesas, and spires of the 50-square-mile
Monument Valley are the ultimate icons of the West, perhaps because they
seem to exist on a different planet than urban and suburban America. The
rock formations are strangely shaped to begin with — they’re named after
everything from mittens to elephants — but what makes them even more
striking is that they rise up suddenly from a practically flat stretch of plain.
It used to be possible to tool around Monument Valley on your own via a
17-mile unpaved and unmaintained loop drive. Because of damage to the
sites and concerns about visitor safety — tourists with low-clearance vehi-
cles frequently got stuck in the road and stranded — those self-guided
tours were phased out a few years ago.
Now the only way to tour Monument Valley is with an on-site guide. Tours
range from 90-minute tours via Jeep or large, open vehicle to overnight
hikes (check out the “Seeing Navajo Nation Northwest by guided tour” sec-
tion later in this chapter for some options). Frankly, tooling around
Monument Valley has never been one of my favorite things to do, espe-
cially in summer when the place is packed: I’d rather appreciate the
scenery at a distance than bump down ungraded, dusty roads. That said,
the formations are sacred to the Navajos, and several of them let visitors
view petroglyphs from earlier cultures. If this is one of your main stops in
Indian Country, you’ll definitely benefit from going with a local guide and
getting the lore behind the rocks.
Note: In 2006, a new visitors center was under construction — sort of. That
is, a partially built structure was said to be slated for that purpose, but no
work was ongoing and no date for completion was available. That shouldn’t
affect your visit — just thought you might wonder about it when you saw it.
See map p. 395. 3 miles off Highway 163; take Highway 160 to Kayenta and drive north

Navajo National Monument
Between Tuba City and Kayenta
Navajo National Monument is a dazzler, with two sets of wonderfully pre-
served cliff dwellings in a sublime high-desert setting of soaring ochre cliffs
punctuated by thick stands of fir and aspen trees. This site is now on
Navajo land, but the people who settled in the two communities preserved
here, Betatakin (beh-tat-uh-kin) and Keet Seel — from about A.D. 950 to A.D.
1300 and A.D. 1250 to A.D. 1300, respectively — are forebears of the Hopi.
(These people are often referred to as the Anasazi, which likely means
“ancient enemy” in Navajo, but archaeologists now prefer the term
Part IV: Exploring the Regions 
402

“Ancestral Puebloans.”) Because Navajo National Monument isn’t as well
known as some of the other ancient sites in the Southwest, crowd control
isn’t a problem — another reason this is one of my top picks in the region.
The 1-mile Sandal Trail loop that leads to a spectacular overlook of
Betatakin involves a bit of an upward slope on the return trip. If you take
the trail slowly, you shouldn’t have a problem, even if most of your hiking
is done from the TV to the refrigerator. (For harder treks, see the “Staying
active” section later in this chapter.) The Sandal Trail loop takes about 45
minutes to complete. Allot another 45 minutes if you also want to hike the
short but steep Aspen Forest Overlook trail, which branches off from the
Sandal Trail. And — I admit — I always end up spending at least 15 minutes
at the great gift shop (see the “Shopping for local treasures” section) next
to the visitor center.
See map p. 395. On Highway 564, 9 miles north of the Highway 160 turnoff. % 928-
672-2366. www.nps.gov/nava. Admission: Free. Daily 8 a.m.–5 p.m., except
Christmas, Thanksgiving, and New Year’s Day.
Page/Lake Powell
Page was started in 1956 as a construction site for Glen Canyon Dam, built
to harness hydroelectric power from the Colorado River. The dam’s sec-
ondary result was a bit more splendid: After 17 years of slowly flooding
nearly 100 dramatic sandstone canyons (most of them in Utah), the huge
reservoir known as Lake Powell was created. Stretch out its 1,960 miles of
shoreline, and you end up with more waterfront property than exists on
the entire West Coast of the United States.
Because of drought conditions in recent years — and because a certain
amount of water is committed to different entities — the lake’s water levels
have hit record lows. In 2006, they were steadily increasing and Lake
Powell was at 46 percent capacity, but that’s still close to the lowest it has
been since 1970, when the canyons were still being filled. That said, it’s by
no means low enough to interfere with most aquatic activities.
The lake is only a small part of the huge Glen Canyon National Recreation
Area. Three smaller marinas on Lake Powell offer recreation, but Wahweap,
6 miles north of Page, is watersports central. Antelope Point, an $80-mil-
lion marina and hotel complex that broke ground in 2003, is aiming to catch
up with Wahweap, but it won’t be fully operational until 2009 (for progress
reports, go to www.azmarinas.com). A restaurant and gift shop opened
there in June 2006; call % 928-645-5900 for general information.
Lots of folks spend their time hanging off the sides of their rented house-
boats or getting wet in other ways (see the “Staying active” section later
in this chapter). If you’re a landlubber — or just want to dry out for a 
bit — you have a few other options.
 Give a dam. You don’t have to care about hydroelectric energy 
to be impressed by the gigantic Glen Canyon Dam, Highway 89, 
2 miles west of Page (% 928-608-6404; www.nps.gov/glca/
damindx.htm); only Hoover Dam is taller (by 16 ft.). You enjoy
Chapter 18: Northeast Arizona: Hopi and Navajo Country 403

great Lake Powell views at the Carl Hayden Visitor Center, where a
small bookstore stocks information about the area’s many natural
attractions. Free 45-minute-long guided tours of the dam are offered
year round on a first-come, first-served basis. The schedule ranges
from four tours daily in winter to nine daily in summer; call ahead for
times. Note: Security at the dam has been tight since 9/11. Leave any
large bags in the car and be prepared to go through a metal detector.
Admission is free. It’s open daily from Memorial Day through Labor
Day 7 a.m.–7 p.m.; rest of year daily 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.; closed
Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year’s Day. See map p. 395.
 Explore an explorer. The John Wesley Powell Memorial Museum,
6 N. Lake Powell Blvd., at N. Navajo Drive (% 928-645-9496; www.
powellmuseum.org), celebrates the life and journeys of the one-
armed Civil War hero who led the first (1869) river expedition along
the entire length of the Grand Canyon. He named the canyon and
many other landmarks in the area and, in turn, had several places —
including Lake Powell — named after him. Rotating exhibits of
dinosaur bones that have been found in the area are also on display.
Admission is $5 adults, $3 ages 5 to 12. Hours are Monday to Friday
9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; closed mid-December to mid-February. Call ahead,
however, because the museum is hoping to stay open additional
days and hours. See map p. 395.
 Dine with the Diné. At the living-history museum run by the Navajo
Village Heritage Center, 1253 Coppermine Rd., about a mile south of
Page (% 928-660-0304; www.navajo-village.com), you find out a
lot about the traditions of the Diné — as the Navajo call themselves.
Tours of several different Navajo structures (for example, a sweat
lodge and two types of homes) take place during the day from 9 a.m.
to 3 p.m. Tours are $5. The dinner program includes a dance per-
formance, talks, and demonstrations such as weaving. The full pro-
gram, from 4 to 7:30p.m, costs $55 for adults, $40 for children ages 6
to 13. I recommend the 2-hour program, beginning at 5 p.m. and 6
p.m., which includes dancing and shorter presentations along with a
Navajo taco dinner; costs are $40 adults, $30 children ($5 less if you
don’t want food). Buy tickets at the John Wesley Powell Memorial
Museum (see listing earlier in this section) or online if you’re inter-
ested in enjoying this unique experience, because programs are only
offered when a minimum of four people commit to attending. See
map p. 395.
 Go over the rainbow. The world’s largest natural arch (height: 290
ft., span: 275 ft.), the spectacular sandstone Rainbow Bridge (www.
nps.gov/rabr) is Lake Powell’s most famous landmark. Long held
sacred by the area’s native peoples, the bridge is in a remote canyon
at the foot of Navajo Mountain, some 50-lake miles north of Wahweap
Marina. The hike is 26 miles round-trip from the nearest land point
and you need a permit, so you probably want to go most of the way
by boat (see the “Guided tours” section). If you want to find out
more about this marathon-length hike, check with Navajo Nation

org) for details. See map p. ###.
 Get the skinny. In Lower Antelope Canyon, sand dunes from an
ancient sea solidified over millennia into what are variously known
as skinny caves, wind caves, slot canyons, corkscrew canyons . . .
well, you get the picture — and so does every professional or aspir-
ing shutterbug. The narrow beams of light that stream into the
caves from above offer a great photo op. The entrance station to
Antelope Canyon Navajo Tribal Park is about 3 miles east of Page
on Highway 98 at milepost 299 (% 928-698-3384 or 928-698-3285).
You can’t visit the canyon unaccompanied, but you can hire a
Navajo guide at the gate; it’s $19 adult, plus a $6 entrance fee, for a
one-hour tour. You can also book a tour from Page (see the “Guided
tours” section later in this chapter), a more reliable option because
the entrance gate tours operate irregularly. Gates usually open
between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m., and close at around 5 p.m.; the last tour
departs at around 3 or 3:30 p.m. For another slot canyon option,
see “The X-Files” sidebar. See map p. 395.
 Take a scenic toss. To reach Horseshoe Bend, a stunning overlook
of the Colorado River that makes a — what else? — complete
Chapter 18: Northeast Arizona: Hopi and Navajo Country 405
The X-Files
It’s not as long as the world-famous Antelope Canyon, and doesn’t have quite as many
whorls and swirls. But Canyon X — a pair of slot canyons linked by a more traditional
canyon rich with plant and animal life — is plenty spectacular nevertheless. And if
you’re looking for a unique experience, as well as the cachet of being able to say that
you boldly went where few men and women have gone before, consider a visit to this
remote spot. It’s about 6 miles upstream from Antelope Canyon, but a world away from
the tourist hordes.
Canyon X also has mystery going for it. Among the strange phenomena that led
Jackson Bridges, a photographer and tour guide, to allude to the other-wordly phe-
nomena of The X-Files TV show when giving Canyon X its name are the perfect circles
that appear on the canyon walls. “Several scientists have visited with me,” Bridges
says, “But they can’t explain these circles away with science.”
Canyon X has only been open to the public since 2000, and only one tour operator,
Overland Tours (see “The Guided tours” section), has access to it: The canyon is on
Navajo land that belongs to the aunt of Harley Klemme, Overland Tours’ owner. The
company offers photographic, hiking, and sightseeing excursions into the canyon,
ranging from $95 to $135 per person. All require some agility, as you have to climb down
a rocky slope to get to the canyon floor. But the tours are not out of the realm of most
people’s physical abilities and more than reward any huffing and puffing you may expe-
rience. See map p. 395.

horseshoe bend around a soaring sandstone butte, take Highway 89
about 5 miles south from the Carl Hayden Visitor Center. A little
before mile marker 545 and just beyond the large “P” on the oppo-
site side of the road, turn west onto a paved pullout (it’s unsigned,
and thus easy to miss), drive about a quarter mile, and park at the
base of the hill. The hike to the overlook is only about three quar-
ters of a mile, each way, but much of it is through soft sand, and
you’ll be walking almost entirely uphill on the way back. That said,
the breathtaking scenery definitely compensates for the energy
expenditure. See map p. 395.
More cool things to see and do
Great views, Navajo history, and dinosaur footprints — the Navajo
Nation Northwest has much more to offer visitors.
 Drive the Goosenecks. Drive north on Highway 163 from Monument
Valley and then turn west on Highway 161 (4 miles past Mexican
Hat, Utah) to reach the overlook for the wildly convoluted, erosion-
created San Juan River canyons called Goosenecks. During the
week, especially off-season, you often find no one at this remote out-
look point except perhaps a jewelry vendor or two. See map p. 395.
 Trade on the past. The Goulding’s Trading Post Museum (see the
“Spending the night” section earlier in this chapter), in the store that
Harry Goulding established in the 1920s, includes Native American
artifacts and mementos from director John Ford’s films. Upstairs,
you can visit the Gouldings’s former living quarters. Admission is a
suggested $2 donation. It’s open April to October daily 7:30 a.m. to 
9 p.m.; hours are more limited November through April. At the Tuba
Trading Post (on the corner of Main and Moenave streets in Tuba
City; % 928-283-5441; high season Mon–Fri 8 a.m.–6 p.m., Sat 8 a.m.–
5 p.m., Sun 9 a.m.–5 p.m.; shorter hours in winter), built in 1902 in
the shape of a six-sided Navajo hogan, locals still trade crafts for
necessities. Along with jewelry, belts, rugs, and the like, you find 
creative T-shirts and books about the Southwest. See map p. 395.
 Discover more about Navajo history. In Kayenta, the unmanned
Navajo Cultural Center, on Highway 160, between the Burger King
and the Hampton Inn (no telephone), includes several traditional
structures — two hogans (the hexagonal buildings that serve as
both homes and ceremonial chambers), a sweat house, and a shade
house with signed displays about Navajo customs and religious
beliefs; sometime crafts or dance exhibitions are offered. Also
check out the “Hogans’ (that’s hoh-gahns) heroes” sidebar in this
chapter for information on displays at the adjacent Burger King.
See map p. 395.
 Track down some dinosaurs. In the first stretch of Highway 160
beyond Highway 89 (just beyond mile marker 316), a turnoff for
Dinosaur Tracks takes you to one of only two sets of dilophosaurus
footprints ever found — and the other set is in China. The
Part IV: Exploring the Regions 
406

dilophosaurus, or “running dinosaur,” got some pretty bad press in
the movie Jurassic Park, where it had a nasty habit of spewing
venom before polishing off its prey. No proof exists that the
dilophosaurus was either poisonous or that it spat (I think there
were dino laws against spitting in public places.) See map p. 395.
A local Navajo child likely will approach you in the parking lot and ask
whether you want a tour. If you agree — though there’s really not a
whole lot to tour — you’re expected to tip a dollar or two.
Guided tours
Whether you prefer to tour by air, boat, Jeep, or even horse, you’re sure
to find an option that suits you. Also check out the “Staying active” sec-
tion later in this chapter, for guided hikes to Navajo National Monument
and for river-rafting trips in Page.
If you want to hover above the crowds at Rainbow Bridge, see spectacular
formations that aren’t accessible by boat or road, or just save some time,
consider taking an air tour. American Aviation (% 866-525-3247 or 928-
608-1060; www.lakepowellair.com) and Westwind Air (% 800-245-
8668 or 928-645-2494; www.westwindairservice.com) offer trips out 
of Page Airport to Lake Powell, Rainbow Bridge, Lees Ferry, Monument
Valley, the Grand Canyon, and southern Utah sights. Times range from a
half hour to 3 hours, cost is from $95–$350 per adult (less for children).
Chapter 18: Northeast Arizona: Hopi and Navajo Country 407
Hogans’ (that’s hoh-gahns) heroes
The secret code devised by a group of Navajos for the United States in World War II
was the only code that the Japanese never broke. Introduced at Iwo Jima, the 
system of encryption — based on, but not exactly the same as, the complex Navajo
language — helped the Allies win a victory that many consider the war’s turning point.
By the end of WWII, the Navajo Code Talkers, as this unit of soldiers was called, num-
bered some 425. About 150 are still alive today.
The fact that the code wasn’t declassified until 1968 is one reason these heroes
remained relatively unsung. That changed in 2002, when filmmaker John Woo’s World
War II thriller Windtalkers, starring Nicholas Cage and Christian Slater, highlighted
this historic episode.
Three small displays on the Navajo reservation detail the Code Talkers’ story with less
glitz and more accuracy. You’ll find them at Kayenta’s Burger King, Highway 160, just
west of the Highway 160/163 intersection; at the Junction restaurant at the Best
Western Canyon de Chelly Inn (see “Spending the night” in the “Navajo Nation East”
section of this chapter); and at the visitor center of Monument Valley (see the
“Exploring Navajo Nation Northwest” section). All feature photographs, memorabilia,
and articles about the Code Talkers; you’ll also see World War II uniforms, weapons,
and Japanese souvenirs.

Four different concessionaires, three with confusingly similar names,
afford you Antelope Canyon entry and guidance: Antelope Canyon
Adventures, 104 S. Lake Powell Blvd. (% 866-645-5501 or 928-645-5501;
www.jeeptour.com); Antelope Canyon Tours, 22 S. Lake Powell Blvd.
(% 928-645-9102 or 928-660-0739 [cell]; www.antelopecanyon.com);
Antelope Canyon Slot Tours, 48 S. Lake Powell (% 928-645-5594; www.
antelopeslotcanyontours.com); and Overland Canyon Tours, 695 N.
Navajo (% 928-608-4072; www.overlandcanyon.com). All charge $20
for adults and $10 for children (plus $6 for a Navajo Nation entry fee,
waived for ages 7 and under) for their basic 90-minute tours. Antelope
Canyon Slot Tours uses enclosed SUVs, but the others operate in open-
sided four-wheel-drive vehicles. All except Antelope Canyon Adventures
are Navajo-run, giving you an insider’s take on the area. All offer longer
tours for photographers, who get to stand around endlessly, waiting for
the light to shift. Overland Canyon is the only one that runs tours to
Canyon X (see “The X-Files” sidebar in this chapter).
Lake Powell Resorts & Marina (% 928-645-1070; www.lakepowell.
com) offers a variety of boat trips from Wahweap Marina. Those trips on
the company’s two-deck cruisers include full-day excursions to Rainbow
Bridge ($105 adult, $73 ages 12 and under; includes a box lunch); and
shorter trips to Antelope Canyon and Navajo Canyon ($49–$33 for a
three-hour tour, $29 and $22 for 90 minutes). In summer, you can also
book a one-hour cruise via the Wahweap Bay Paddlewheeler ($12 adults,
$9 children), or enjoy a dinner cruise on the Canyon King paddlewheeler,
a 19th-century riverboat ($61 adult and children). Expect to pay an addi-
tional “water surcharge” of $1.75 on all the tours. With the exception of
the paddlewheeler and dinner cruises, all excursions are offered year-
round, but schedules change seasonally, so check ahead.
Trip times can vary up to 45 minutes, depending on lake levels and water
traffic And when water levels are low, boats can’t come very close to
Rainbow Bridge; in 2006, a 1.5-mile hike to and from the site was required
Navajo-led tours around Monument Valley range from 90-minute Jeep
jaunts (around $20 per person) to overnight horseback excursions ($160).
You also find hiking tours to Mitchell Mesa that last three and a half hours
($65); full-day tours that divide their times between Monument Valley and
Mystery Valley, where you can see cliff dwellings and petroglyphs ($115);
sunrise ($45) and sunset ($45) tours on four wheels or four feet; and tours
where photography is the main focus (from $50 an hour). About a dozen
tour operators have kiosks at Monument Valley. I haven’t done any com-
parison touring, but can definitely recommend Simpson’s Trailhandler’s
Tours (% 435-727-3362; www.trailhandlertours.com). All the guides in
the company are Navajos who have grown up in the Monument Valley
area, and their expertise about the site’s landscape and lore is invaluable.
When you drive to the dirt parking area just past the Monument Valley
visitor center, you see rows of concessionaire’s booths. Don’t make your-
self crazy by comparison shopping. The park superintendent fixes the
prices for all the tour groups so the sellers can’t go above the advertised
Part IV: Exploring the Regions 
408

rates (they can dip a little below). In addition, I suggest that you decide in
advance what kind of tour you want to take, in what kind 
of vehicle — or nonvehicle. (Incidentally, if it’s a choice between an
enclosed Jeep and a seat on an open-air truck, I’d spend the extra money
on the Jeep to avoid the dust.) Establishing your preferences gives you a
sound basis for choosing a guide service.
Staying active
I cover horseback riding and hiking in Monument Valley in the preceding
section. Except for hiking in Navajo National Monument, all the following
activities take place in the Page/Lake Powell area:
 Fishing: Lake Powell, like hell, never freezes over — which makes the
lake an angler’s heaven. Large- and small-mouth bass, striped bass,
catfish, carp, walleye, and crappie abound year-round. Because Lake
Powell straddles both Arizona and Utah, unless you stay on one side
of the lake or the other, you need two licenses (fees for nonresidents:
$13 in Arizona, $12 in Utah for one day; prices go down the longer
the license length). You can get all your paperwork and buy tackle
and bait at Wahweap Marina (% 928-645-1136), where you can also
rent a boat (see the “Watersports” bullet later in this section).
Bubba’s Guide Service (% 888-741-2822 or 928-645-3506; www.
bubbasguide.com) can lead you to all the prime angling spots,
including the tight ones, on sleek, fast bass boats. The price — $400
for a nine-hour day for the first two people, $50 each additional
person — includes everything except ground transportation and
licenses.
 Golfing: The 18-hole Lake Powell National Golf Course, 400 N.
Clubhouse Drive (behind the Marriott; % 928-645-2023; www.golf
lakepowell.com), is one of the most stunning places in the state
to tee off — the lush, rolling greens contrast with the surrounding
red and buff sandstone and startling blue-green lake. Green fees are
reasonable, too: $55 for 18 holes, including cart. Off-season and twi-
light specials lower rates even more.
 Hiking: Hikes to the major ruins at Navajo National Monument are
always offered between Memorial Day and Labor Day, and are usu-
ally available in spring and fall. Rangers lead the difficult five-hour
treks to Betatakin, departing every morning at 8 in summer, less fre-
quently off-season. These hikes are on a first-come, first-served
basis and limited to 25 per group. To get up close and personal
with Keet Seel, you need to reserve a backcountry permit for the
17-mile (round-trip) trek. In the off-season, you need to arrange a
park ranger escort for the Keet Seel trip; from mid-May to Labor
Day you can go on your own (well, okay, you can go with a friend).
This hike, restricted to 20 people a day, is very popular, so call as
soon as you know when you’re going to visit. Reservations are
taken up to two months in advance by the visitor center at Navajo
National Monument (% 928-672-2700).
Chapter 18: Northeast Arizona: Hopi and Navajo Country 409

For a shortish hike near Page, you can’t do better than Horseshoe
Bend. In addition, the Carl Hayden Visitor Center (see the listing for
Page/Lake Powell under “Exploring Navajo Nation Northwest,” ear-
lier in this chapter, for both) is a great source for trail information,
and can tell you which new areas are hikeable as a result of the
receding lake levels. You can pick up a map of the 8-mile hiking,
biking, and jogging trail that surrounds the mesa on which Page sits
at the Page–Lake Powell Tourism Bureau (for the address, see the
“Fast Facts: Navajo Nation Northwest” section in this chapter).
 River rafting: Open water without the fear, but not without the
excitement. Lake Powell Vacations (% 800-530-3406 or 928-608-
0800; http://lakepowellvacations.com) runs smooth water-
rafting trips from Glen Canyon Dam to Lees Ferry. You float along
an undeveloped section of the Colorado River past sandstone cliffs
and Native American petrogylphs. From mid-May to mid-September,
two half-day trips head out at 7:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. ($62 adults,
$52 ages 12 and under). The rest of the year, departures are once a
day. Tours depart from Wilderness Outfitters, 50 S. Lake Powell
Blvd. in Page (% 928-645-3279).
 Watersports: Lake Powell is not exactly serene in summer. Every
motorized or human-powered contraption you can imagine zips in
and out (and sometimes under) every inlet and cove.
If you can’t beat the throngs, join ’em at the Wahweap Marina
(% 928-645-1111) where you can rent your favorite water toy: Sea
Doos, which are kind of like water motorcycles ($163–$271 a day, for
two people, depending on the season); wakeboards ($39 per day
year round); ski tubes ($24); or jet skis ($163–$271); the rate is $41 to
$69 per hour and $198 to $330 per day for a 19-foot craft that holds
eight. A one- or two-person kayak runs you from $4 to $6 per hour,
$15 to $25 per day. A two-hour minimum applies on all hourly rentals.
Except for power boats, renting your watersports equipment in
town is cheaper. At H2O Zone, 136 6th Ave. (% 928-645-3121; www.
powellzone.com), for example, jet skis will run you $145 per day,
year round. But — and it’s a big but — the toys are large and you
must get them to the water. Still, even adding on the cost of renting
a truck from the shop ($45), you can save money in high season.
Part IV: Exploring the Regions

Health — check? Car — check?
The Navajo and Hopi reservations are not ideal destinations if you or your wheels
aren’t in shipshape condition. A few modern medical facilities and up-to-date car
repair or parts shops exist, but the region is large and remote, so assistance isn’t
always quick. For the locations of medical facilities and road-service providers, see
also the “Fast Facts” sections in this chapter for Navajo Nation Northwest, Navajo
Nation East, and the Hopi Mesas.

Shopping for local treasures
Native American crafts, especially those crafts made by the Navajo, are
sold all over Page, but you’re better off going directly to the source: the
reservation. You aren’t automatically guaranteed high quality or low
prices there, but at least you don’t pay extra for a middleman’s commis-
sion. Also, keep in mind that if you buy from one of the open-air vendors
near practically every natural attraction, you don’t pay extra for real-
estate overhead.
Impromptu outdoor markets are hit and miss. Sometimes you see goods
that look (and are) mass-produced from China, other times you find
treasures (I once bought a prized and unique key chain at the bottom of
the Canyon de Chelly). Bargaining is acceptable; just find the comfort
zone between not wanting to be taken advantage of and not being the
one who’s taking advantage. Remember, you’re likely to pay a lot more
for these crafts at home.
In Kayenta, the hotel gift shops carry a good array of Navajo-made items;
also, you find a branch of the cooperative Navajo Arts and Crafts
Enterprise (% 928-697-8611) on Highway 160, east of the intersection
with Highway 163 (just beyond the Thriftway supermarket). The gift
shop in Navajo National Monument carries items you’re not likely to see
anywhere else on the reservation, created by Native American artists
from all around Arizona and New Mexico, and two historic trading posts
still sell interesting crafts; see “Exploring Navajo Nation Northwest,” in
this chapter for information on all these spots.

Hospitals
Page Hospital, 501 N. Navajo Ave. (% 928-
645-2424), is your best bet in case of a
medical emergency. On the Navajo reser-
vation, U.S. Public Health Service Indian
hospitals in Tuba City (% 928-283-2501)
and Kayenta (% 928-697-4000) are avail-
able; locate these hospitals via the blue
“H” road signs (or ask locally). Only Native
Americans get free medical care, but
others are welcome to use the hospitals’
services; many insurance plans are
accepted.

Navajo Nation East
This remote area doesn’t have many landmarks or attractions, but those it
does have are terrific. In addition to Canyon de Chelly (one of my all-time
favorite spots) and the Hubbell Trading Post (a wonderfully preserved
and still functioning historic retail hub), this region encompasses Window
Rock, the Navajo Nation’s capital, and the Four Corners Monument, a
place you should visit — once.
You may spend two leisurely days at the Canyon de Chelly — hiking,
four-wheeling, horseback riding, and perhaps taking a short side trip 
to Window Rock — or choose to see the canyon in a very long morning
or afternoon by just driving along one of the two rim routes. The Four
Corners Monument isn’t on the way to anywhere in Arizona, so you need
to detour to get there (unless you’re heading to Colorado). The Hubbell
Trading Post, on the other hand, is en route to almost everywhere you’re
likely to visit, requiring just a few miles of backtracking. All in all, if
you’re on the move, you may cover the entire area comfortably in about
a day and a half. Plan to spend the night near Canyon de Chelly, not only
because the area is beautiful, but also because it offers the nicest lodg-
ings on the Navajo reservation.
Getting there
If you come from the north (from around Monument Valley), take
Highway 160 East. The distance from Kayenta to Mexico Water is 40
miles. Turn south onto Highway 191 and drive 60 miles to reach Chinle,
the closest town to Canyon de Chelly. (Alternatively, keep going another
40-odd miles on Highway 160 beyond Mexico Water and you arrive at the
Four Corners Monument. If you’re thinking of going there, now’s the
time!) You journey another 30 miles south on Highway 191 from Chinle to
the Highway 264 turnoff to reach Ganado, home of the Hubbell Trading
Post. This stretch is actually a 6-mile interruption in Highway 191, which
you take south another 38 miles to get to I-40.

The intersection of Highway 191 and I-40 is 140 miles east of Flagstaff. If
you approach via the southern I-40 route, just follow these instructions
backward. (You won’t discover any hidden references to Satan if you
repeat them at high speed, I promise.)
Spending the night
The best place to hole up in this part of Arizona is around Chinle. The
accommodations aren’t fancy, but they’re very pleasant, and you wake
up in or very near to the wonderful Canyon de Chelly. In addition to
their various amenities, all the hotels in Chinle offer tour desks.
Around Window Rock (see the “More cool things to see and do” section
later in this chapter), you find the modest Navajo Nation Inn ($), 48 W.
Hwy. 264 at Highway 12 (% 800-662-6189 or 928-871-4108; www.navajo
nationinn.com), which is clean and reasonably efficient, and a newer,
better equipped Day’s Inn ($$) (see the Appendix for the toll-free
number).
Best Western Canyon de Chelly Inn

Chinle
The farthest from the canyon of the three hotels recommended here (but
still less than 4 miles from the park entrance) and without much distinct
character, this motel compensates with an indoor pool, sauna, and hot
tub; an on-site bakery; and rooms that have a bit of Southwest flair. The
Junction Café is a local hangout, and features a small Code Talker display
(see the “Hogans’ [that’s hoh-gahns] heroes” sidebar).

Holiday Inn Canyon de Chelly
$$
Chinle
Built in 1992, this Holiday Inn holds on to a bit of Old West history: The
main lobby incorporates the trading post built on this site in the 1880s.
The hotel restaurant and gift shop go way beyond generic, too. Rooms, on
the other hand, are pastel bland, but have all the modern requisites. The
hotel sometimes hosts outdoor music and dance performances, and
although you’re not inside the park, you’re actually closer to the start of
both rim drives than you are at the Thunderbird Lodge.

You have it all here — history, nature, and shopping. The only roofed bunk
within the park’s boundaries, this one-time trading post sits nestled in a
lovely cottonwood grove. Rooms, in pink pueblo-style buildings, are

shop and a Navajo rug–draped dining room in the original 1896 building.

Dining locally
You don’t find much in the way of fine dining in this region, but you
enjoy lots of local flavor around the Canyon de Chelly. (Remember 
that the Navajo Nation bans alcohol.) Food in the Thunderbird Lodge
restaurant ($–$$) — the original trading post building lined with old
photos — is served cafeteria style, which works well if you’re a vegetar-
ian, because you get a nice choice of side dishes and desserts (it also has-
tens the food acquisition process, which can be slow in the area’s other
eateries). Garcia’s ($$) in the Holiday Inn is the closest this area comes to
fine dining, with Navajo-inspired dishes such as blue-corn-breaded trout
offered along with American standards. Locals, who have little other
choice, except for a few fast-food places, frequent both of these restau-
rants. The low-key Junction Café ($–$$) at the Best Western, serving
decent American, Mexican, and Navajo coffee-shop grub, gets the lunch

Oh, give me a hogan
Staying in a hogan is camping raised to an art — and cultural — form. You sleep in a
traditional six-sided log, dirt, and cement structure with a small hole in the center (in
Manhattan, it’s called a skylight). Smoke from a wood-burning stove escapes through
the opening. You glimpse the stars while you’re lying on a cot, sleeping bag, or sheep-
skins. (Sorry, no indoor plumbing — another reason this experience is like camping.)
Coyote Pass Hospitality (% 928-724-3383; www.navajocentral.org/cppage.
htm) introduced this type of accommodation to the Navajo reservation in the 1990s.
Among the three hogans offered by Coyote Pass to guests is one at Tsaile, not far from
the Canyon de Chelly. In recent years, various other Navajo concessionaires, includ-
ing Simpson’s Trailhandler’s Tours (% 435-727-3362; www.trailhandlertours.
com) at Monument Valley, have jumped on the stay-in-a-hogan bandwagon.
Ceremonies and tours of the area may be bundled with these accommodations in a
“Native experience” package. Expect to pay anything from $85 per person for lodging
and breakfast alone to $150 per person with dinner and tour options.

and breakfast townie regulars. You’ll be hard pressed to spend more than
$10 here.
Fans of Tony Hillerman’s mysteries may want to check out the restau-
rant in Window Rock’s Navajo Nation Inn ($$), where fictional Navajo
police detectives Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee drink endless cups of
coffee. The standard American/Navajo fare is pretty good.
If you buy a snack from one of the vendors near the Four Corners
Monument (corn dogs or fry bread, for example), you can pig out in four
states. Now you can’t say I never tell you how to have a good time!
Exploring Navajo Nation East
You should find something to satisfy your interests here, whether you
crave rug buying, canyon hiking, or splaying yourself around four states.
The top attractions
Canyon de Chelly National Monument
Chinle
The Grand Canyon (see Chapter 17) is, well, grander, but cold and remote
compared with the softer, more accessible grace of these gorges. In the
Blessing Way ceremony, the Navajo speak of walking in beauty. Those
words often come to my mind when I visit the Canyon de Chelly (de-shay)
and gaze at the soaring red sandstone cliffs rising from canyon floors laced
with gently flowing streams and dotted with cottonwoods. In addition to
its natural allures, the area is also rich in culture. Many dwellings and pet-
roglyphs of the ancestral Puebloans are found here, as are sites important
to the Navajo, who resisted relocation by the U.S. military by holing up at
the canyon’s Fortress Rock. The Navajos still farm and graze sheep on the
canyon floor. A bonus: Inviting as the area is, it’s relatively uncrowded.
You may choose from two rim drives: a 37-mile round-trip South Rim drive
with seven dramatic overlooks into the Canyon de Chelly (the name of one
of the three gorges that meet here, as well as the name of the national mon-
ument); and a 34-mile North Rim drive with four vistas overlooking the
adjoining Canyon del Muerto. Both drives branch off from the same road
(Highway 64/Indian Route 7) just beyond the visitor center. The South Rim
drive takes at least two hours when you add in the time you spend gazing
from each viewpoint. Because the North Rim drive has fewer viewpoints,
the drive’s a bit shorter; you can cover it in about one and a half hours.
Have time for only one? If you’re most interested in the vistas, choose the
South Rim drive with spectacular overlooks like Spider Rock. The North
Rim, with sites such as Antelope House and Massacre Cave, is ideal for his-
tory buffs. Get details on both routes from the visitor center, where you
can also check out the available activities, such as the ranger talks given
in the hogan.
Chapter 18: Northeast Arizona: Hopi and Navajo Country 415

The only unescorted hike you may take into the Canyon de Chelly is on
the 2.5-mile round-trip White House Ruin trail, which leads from the White
House overlook on the South Rim to the White House Ruin. It’s a moder-
ately difficult trek, with a winding descent of 600 feet to the canyon floor,
where you can see a two-level ancestral Puebloan cliff dwelling dating back
to around A.D. 1060.
For other hikes, as well as horseback rides and Jeep tours, you need a
Navajo guide (see the “Guided tours” section later in this chapter).
See map p. 395. At Indian Route 7 and Highway 64 (3 miles east of Highway 191). 
% 928-674-5500. www.nps.gov/cach. Admission: Free. Visitor center daily
Oct–Apr 8 a.m.–5 p.m.; May–Sept 8 a.m.–6 p.m.; closed Christmas You may drive
along the paved canyon rims any time, weather permitting — you just don’t see any-
thing in the dark.
Hubbell Trading Post National Historic Site
Near Ganado
I’m happy when I can merge two of my prime interests — history and 
retail — so I’m in hog heaven here. John Lorenzo Hubbell purchased this
trading post in 1878, and the Hubbell family operated it until 1967, when
the family sold it to the National Park Service. Although not-for-profit now
and managed by trader Steve Pickles, the post still looks (and works)
much the same as it did a century ago.
You can browse Southwest crafts of all types here, but the specialty is
Navajo rugs, both new and antique. Unless you’re planning on buying a
rug, which can take half the day, you’ll probably spend more time here in
summer, when lots of events are slated, than in winter. Call ahead — espe-
cially during the off-season — to get a schedule for the Hubbell home
tours, weaving demonstrations, lectures, or tours of the 160-acre grounds.
All the activities are interesting — and free. A 30-minute house tour plus
the standard amount of rug and craft ogling takes about 1 to one and a half
hours.
See map p. 395. One mile west of Ganado on Highway 264. % 928-755-3475. www.
nps.gov/hutr. Admission: Free. Daily summer 8 a.m.–6 p.m.; daily winter 8 a.m.–
5 p.m.; closed Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year’s Day. Tours of the Hubbell
home ($2 per person) are given on the hour (usually every hour) during the summer,
less frequently in winter.
More cool things to see and do
A couple of oddities — one natural, one man-made — may also be of
interest.
 Get a window on Navajoland. Window Rock is the hole-y sand-
stone cliff that gave the Navajo Nation’s capital its name. Find the
formation 2 miles north of Highway 264, near the government
administration center. Besides this sandstone cliff, take time to 
see the modern Navajo Nation Museum, at Highway 264 and Post
Part IV: Exploring the Regions 
416

Office Loop Road (% 928-871-7941). The museum is still a work in
progress as the permanent collections evolve and expand. Expect
to see everything from historic photographs to contemporary
Navajo art. Admission is free. It’s open Monday 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
Tuesday through Friday 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., and Saturday 9 a.m. to 
5 p.m. See map p. 395.
 Survey a cartographic quirk. Did you know that Native Americans
own the piece of the United States where Arizona, New Mexico, 
Utah, and Colorado meet? Officially called Four Corners Monument
Navajo Tribal Park, a quarter mile north of Highway 160 (6 miles
beyond the Highway 164 junction at Teec Nos Pos; % 928-871-6647),
the site isn’t much more than a bronze plaque on a concrete slab
with four state seals, but you have to come, if only to see people
splay their arms and legs in awkward positions in order to be pho-
tographed in four states — and to get yourself snapped in a similarly
compromising pose. You find snack and souvenir stands here and
also restrooms (you’ll be literally relieved because by the time you
arrive at this site you’ll have been driving around the middle of
nowhere for ages). Admission is $3. It’s open May to mid-August
daily 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., and late August to April 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.; 
closed Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year’s day. See map p. 395.
Guided tours
All the following guided activities take place in the Canyon de Chelly.
Also check out the “Exploring Navajo Nation East” section for informa-
tion on guided tours of the Hubbell Trading Post.
Be sure to reserve all these tours ahead of time. In summer, tours fill up
fast, and in winter, many tours operate only if a minimum number of
people sign on.
 Hiking: On all Canyon de Chelly hikes, except the White House
Ruin trail, a Navajo guide is required. At the visitor center (% 928-
674-5500), you find members of the Tsegi Guide Association, who
take you (and 14 others, max) trekking for $15 per person, per hour
(minimum of three hours). Destinations depend on your interests
and the hiking ability of the group. Sometimes you get to view the
canyon’s rock art; other times you may follow the Tunnel Trail to
see a ruin.
Don’t be macho (or macha). If you don’t hike much, make that clear
to your guide. A hike that is easy for your guide, who may run up
and down the canyon to visit relatives routinely, may be very diffi-
cult for you. If you have a fear of heights (or, more accurately,
edges), discuss that concern, too. (I didn’t think to ask, and I found
myself terrified by the sheer rock ledges involved in the descent.)
 Four- (or six-) wheel tours: The Thunderbird Lodge (see the
“Spending the night” section earlier in this chapter) runs tours of
the canyon in six-wheel-drive flatbed trucks outfitted with padded
Chapter 18: Northeast Arizona: Hopi and Navajo Country 417

seats. A full-day version of these tours is available from spring 
to late fall, road conditions permitting ($70 adults and children,
including lunch); in winter, six-hour tours cost $55. Half-day tours
are available year-round, departing at 9 a.m. and 1 p.m., depending
on the season ($43 adults, $33 children under 12). In winter, modi-
fied full-day tours are offered for $55.
De Chelly Tours (% 928-674-3772; www.dechellytours.com)
offers a variety of four-wheel excursions into the canyon. Tours
cost $125 for three hours in a Jeep Wrangler that holds three pas-
sengers (plus a guide) and $150 (for the first four people) to $175
(for five to seven people) for an eight-person capacity vehicle. In 
all cases, an additional $30 per hour (per vehicle) is charged if you
want to tour longer than three hours. These tours, which include
Antelope House and the White House Ruin, depart twice daily in
high season, less frequently in winter.
Similar Jeep tours with similar rates are run by the similarly named
Canyon de Chelly Tours; they can be booked at the gift shop of the
Holiday Inn (see the “Spending the night” section earlier in this
chapter) or by contacting the company directly at % 928-674-5433
or www.canyondechellytours.com. Three-hour tours in a Unimog
army truck that cost $50 per person ($35 for children) theoretically
depart twice daily, but these tours operate only if all 12 spaces are
filled. Private Jeep tours are also available for $130 for 1 to 3 people
for three hours, $175 for groups of 4 to 6; each extra hour will run
the gang an additional $60.
You still must follow a Navajo leader if you drive your own all-ter-
rain vehicle, but the tour is less expensive: $25 per hour per vehi-
cle, with a three-hour minimum. Canyon de Chelly and De Chelly
Tours and the Tsegi Guide Association (see the “Hiking” bullet ear-
lier in this list) lead you (and up to four more vehicles) for $20 to
$25 per hour (three-hour minimum).
 Horseback tours: Justin’s Horse Rental, South Rim Drive near the
park entrance (% 928-674-5678), and Totsonni Ranch, South Rim
Drive 11⁄3 miles east of the Spider Rock turnoff, where the pavement
ends (% 928-755-6209; www.totsoniiranch.com), charge $10 and
$15, respectively, per-person horse rental, plus an additional $15
per hour charge for the guide. Rides generally run from two to six
hours, although overnight pack trips are available, too.
Shopping for local treasures
You don’t have to go beyond the area’s two main attractions to shop. At
the Canyon de Chelly, the Thunderbird Lodge and the Holiday Inn run
excellent gift shops; the latter is smaller, but has some unusual, high-
quality pieces. And although rugs are its specialty, you can find pretty
much any type of craft you’re looking for at the Hubbell Trading Post.
If you’re visiting Window Rock, check out the Navajo Arts & Crafts
Enterprise, Highway 264 and Route 12 (% 928-871-4090), and the gift

shop at the Navajo Nation Museum (see “More cool things to see and
do” section earlier in this chapter), which has a huge collection of Native
American tapes and CDs that you may listen to before you buy.

Native American etiquette: Some 
reservation do’s and don’ts
Forgive me if you think I’m stating the obvious, but you may be surprised how many
people seem to leave their manners — and sense — back home.
 Don’t approach or enter a home uninvited. How would you feel if someone wan-
dered into your living room or knocked on your door, asking for a tour?
 Don’t enter any areas marked off-limits. In addition, stay on designated trails or
routes unless a Native American tour guide accompanies you. Driving or hiking
back roads or trails on your own is forbidden.
 Don’t litter.
 Don’t bring alcohol, drugs, or firearms onto the reservation.
 Observe outdoor as well as indoor privacy. On the Navajo reservation, ask for
permission to photograph, videotape, sketch, or audiotape any event or person. (If
you are granted permission, you’re expected to tip the grantee a dollar or two.)
On the Hopi reservation, no photography and other types of reproduction — either
personal or commercial — are allowed. Period.
 Make sure your attendance at a ceremony is permitted. Just because an event
is held outside doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s open to the public. And if you’re
granted permission to attend, stand politely in the back unless you’re invited to
do otherwise. (Imagine attending an outdoor wedding where strangers shove in
front of the immediate family to get a better view of the ceremony.) And don’t
applaud.

The Hopi Mesas
Navajo land entirely surrounds the small Hopi reservation, but the size
of their real-estate holdings isn’t the only thing that distinguishes the
two nations. The Navajo, who migrated from Canada in the 15th century,
are relative newcomers to this area, whereas ancestors of the Hopi have
been in the Four Corners region since prehistoric times. The Hopi estab-
lished the village of Old Oraibi in the 12th century, when upstart settle-
ments like Boston or even St. Augustine, Florida, weren’t even gleams in
European explorers’ eyes.
The Hopi reservation has no Safeways, McDonald’s, or Holiday Inns. One
of the villages, Walpi, isn’t even wired for electricity. And, although the
pueblos (villages) and the three mesas on which they perch are pictur-
esque, they offer few natural or archaeological attractions. Why come
here, then? For a glimpse of an ancient culture’s living traditions.
Tourism is a mixed blessing for the Hopi, simultaneously an economic
necessity and, at times, a pain in the neck (see the “Native American eti-
quette: Some reservation do’s and don’ts” sidebar earlier in this chapter).
Strolling around the villages and browsing the shops takes you no more
than a half to a full day. The one hotel on the reservation isn’t exactly
hopping after dark. If you’re up for a peaceful evening, spend the night;
otherwise, make the Hopi mesas a day visit.
Getting there
Highway 264, which extends from Tuba City to the Arizona/New Mexico
border, links the Hopi reservation with the outside world, Highway 191 
is its easternmost link. The southern roads connecting Highway 264 with
I-40 are Highway 77 (just east of Holbrook); Highway 87 (at Winslow);
Highway 99; and Indian Route 15 (both Highway 99 and Indian Route 15
hook up with Indian Route 2 at Leupp).
If you’re en route from (or to) Flagstaff, Indian Route 15 to Indian Route 2
is a scenic shortcut that takes you right into the heart of Hopi land,
between the Second and Third Mesas.

Hospitals
A hospital is available in Chinle (% 928-
674-7001), but Sage Memorial Hospital in
nearby Ganado (% 928-755-3411) has
better facilities.
Information
The visitor center of the Canyon de Chelly
and the Hubbell Trading Post are your best
resources. In Window Rock, the Navajo
Nation Visitor Center in the Navajo Nation
Museum is open Monday to Friday 8 a.m.
to 5 p.m. For all three locations, see the
“Exploring Navajo Nation East” section
earlier in this chapter.

In addition to linking the Hopi reservation with the outside world,
Highway 264 is also the route you take through it; the road runs through
the entire Hopi reservation, from Keams Canyon on the east to Moenkopi
on the west; all the small, unnamed roads that lead to the three Hopi
mesas branch off from Highway 264.
Spending the night
To say your choice of lodgings is limited is an understatement; the reser-
vation offers one motel, period. If you don’t choose to bed down there,
your next best bet is Winslow (see “Staying the night” in the “Along Old
Route 66” section later in this chapter), some 70 miles away.
The Hopi Cultural Center Motel
$$
Second Mesa
How can you resist a motel that lists as its location “the Center of the
Universe?” The hotel is definitely at the center of the Hopi tourist world,
with the best restaurant on the reservation (see the following “Dining
locally” section), a museum that doubles as an informal visitor center, and
the only lodging available. The guest rooms are modest but clean, and
have some nice Native American design touches, as well as TVs and
phones.

$95–100 double; Oct 16–Mar 14 $65–$70 double. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V.
Dining locally
In the Keams Canyon shopping center, a coffee shop dishes out burgers,
sandwiches, and Native American dinner fare (although the fry bread
pileup isn’t called a Navajo taco here, as it is elsewhere). But unless you’re
really hungry, best hold out for the Hopi Cultural Center restaurant ($)
on Second Mesa. There, you find everything from BLTs to Philly cheese
steaks on the menu, but go for the local dishes such as Nöqkwivi (a lamb
and hominy stew served with green chiles), which comes with blue-corn
fry bread. It’s open for breakfast, lunch, and (early) dinner year-round.
Remember, no alcohol is permitted on the Hopi reservation.
Exploring the Hopi Mesas
Most of the Hopi villages cluster on three mesas that are about 10 miles
apart from each other and which extend, fingerlike, from the huge Black
Mesa to the north. The town of Moenkopi, 40 miles west of Third Mesa,
and Keams Canyon, an administrative center 15 miles east of First Mesa,
offer little to interest the visitor.
Although physically close, the three mesa villages have different histo-
ries and governing bodies. You can’t necessarily expect someone on
Third Mesa to give you information about First Mesa. You can stroll
Chapter 18: Northeast Arizona: Hopi and Navajo Country 421

around all the villages except Walpi — accessible by guided tour only —
but you don’t find bronze “HISTORIC LANDMARK” plaques on the old houses
and small shops (nor do you find signs with town names, for that matter).
Don’t worry, getting lost isn’t a problem; each mesa has only one road,
and you can figure a cluster of houses is a village. Be courteous and park
outside the towns, not on the narrow streets.
Make your first stop at the Hopi Cultural Center on Second Mesa, where
you’re introduced to Hopi traditions and can browse the posted notices
about the events on the different mesas. After that, drive over to Walpi on
First Mesa for one of the daily tours and finish off with a stroll around Old
Oraibi on Third Mesa. Alternatively, if you want to arrive in time for lunch
at the Hopi Cultural Center, begin your day with the Walpi tour, a good
initiation into Hopi culture. Perhaps the best — if most expensive —
option is to book an individual guide (see the “Guided tours” section
later in this chapter) before you arrive. Hopi is far more difficult than the
Navajo reservation for outsiders to enjoy unassisted. Without guidance,
it’s easy to leave here as mystified as you were before you arrived — and
to miss interesting archaeological sights that are otherwise off-limits to
visitors.
The Hopi are renowned for their elaborate religious ceremonial dances —
but don’t be disappointed if you don’t get to see one. Because of visitors’
disrespectful behavior in the past, the famous snake dances are com-
pletely barred to outsiders, and access to the katsina dances is restricted;
only katsina dances on Second and Third mesas are occasionally open to
non-Native Americans now.
Katsina dances are very elaborate, colorful religious ceremonies, with
masked and costumed dancers representing the katsina spirits. The
Hopi hold the dances most weekends from December to July, but even
the locals don’t know until a day or two in advance exactly where and
when these dances occur. If you’re determined to see a dance, your best
bet is to show up on a weekend during katsina season, find out if a dance
is scheduled, and ask permission to attend. (And if you do get to go,
behave yourself!)
First Mesa
At the foot of First Mesa you find Polacca, a town founded in the late
1800s as an offshoot of Walpi. Walpi is the most interesting of this
mesa’s towns, both for its old sandstone homes and its amazing views.
Established on the side of the mesa as early as A.D. 900, Walpi moved 
to the hilltop for protection purposes after the 1680 Pueblo Revolt
against the Spanish. The steep road that snakes up to Walpi also passes
Sichomovi and Hano/Tewa, both established after the 1680 revolt, the
former by the people of Walpi, the latter by two successive groups of
non-Hopi Puebloan peoples.
Part IV: Exploring the Regions 
422

Second Mesa
The Hopi Cultural Center Museum, on the north side of Highway 264,
about 5 miles west of the junction with Highway 87 (% 928-734-6650), is
the main draw of Second Mesa. The museum is open Monday to Friday
from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. (admission $3). (As we went to press, the center
was open on Saturday, too, but that may not last if too few people turn
up.) The oldest village on the mesa is Shungopavi, which lies to the
south of Highway 264, on the road west of the Hopi Cultural Center.
Sipolauvi and Mishongnovi, on a paved road that heads north from
Highway 264 just east of the cultural center, were both created soon
after the 1680 Pueblo Revolt. You see the Corn Rock shrine, a natural
monument, just below the edge of the mesa in Mishongnovi.
Third Mesa
Old Oraibi, founded around 1100, claims to be the oldest continuously
occupied town in the United States. You see the ruins of a Spanish mis-
sion, as well as several ancient houses intermingled with newer ones. (If
you plan to wander around, you may want to do the locals the courtesy
of politely introducing yourself at the shop called Hamana so’oh, which
is an informal visitor center.) All the other Third Mesa towns derive from
Old Oraibi: Hotelvilla was formed after an internal clan schism in 1906;
Bacavi was a 1907 offshoot of Hotelvilla; and Kykmostmovi, at the base
of the mesa, was founded soon afterward by villagers who wanted to be
closer to the main road. Kykmostmovi is the home to the Hopi Tribal
offices (see the “Fast Facts: The Hopi Mesas” section later in this chap-
ter). Although 40 miles to the northwest, Moenkopi is also a satellite
town of Oraibi and considered part of Third Mesa.
Guided tours
Guided walking tours of Walpi on First Mesa run from 30 to 45 minutes and
are given daily between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. in summer, 9:30 a.m. and 4 p.m.
in winter, except when religious ceremonies are being held ($8 adults, $5
ages 5–17). No set starting times are scheduled for the walks; tour guides
wait at the First Mesa Visitor Center in Sichomovi (% 928-737-2262) —
just keep driving up the hill until you see the sign for the center — until
about ten people gather or until the guides determine that no one else is
going to turn up.
On the tour, the guides ask whether you want to visit any artisans’
houses. You may decline but, if you say yes, you’re under no obligation
to buy anything. However, you may have a tough time walking away
empty-handed, especially because many of the artists are poor. Don’t let
guilt be your guide. If you don’t like what you see at the first home,
you’re bound to find something you really want to purchase later.
Bertram Tsavadawa, an Oraibi native, tours visitors around his village
and around a petroglyph site called Dawa Park. He charges $25 per
person per hour, and the excursions generally take around two hours.

guided tours run by Gary Tso at Left Handed Hunter (% 928-734-2567;

ingly more expensive, starting from $125 for two people for a half-day
tour that includes a visit to a Hopi artist and a tour of Old Oraibi and the
petroglyphs.
Shopping for local treasures
Many of the shops on the Hopi mesas are literally mom-and-pop opera-
tions: Residents sell crafts out of their homes (look for signs that say
something like, “Pottery sold here”). Log on to www.hopimarket.com for
a preview of goods and prices. See also Chapter 19 for information on
Hopi katsina dolls and overlay silverwork.
Among the more traditional shops, my favorite is Tsakurshovi, Second
Mesa (11⁄2 miles east of the Hopi Cultural Center on Highway 264; % 928-
734-2478), with a great collection of high-quality and unusual crafts. The
staff is extremely knowledgeable — and this shop is the only place to find
owner Janet Day’s original “Don’t Worry, Be Hopi” T-shirts and bumper
stickers. Look for the blue signs to locate Hopi Market, Indian Route 2,
milepost 45 (% 928-309-7027; www.hopimarket.com); if you don’t find it,
you can always order from its excellent selection of silver inlay jewelry
and other crafts on line. The Hopi Silver Crafts Cooperative, just west of
the Hopi Cultural Center (% 928-734-2463), has a large selection of belt
buckles, jewelry, and other decorative items. A non-Hopi business but
owned by traders long respected on the reservation, McGee’s Indian Art
in Keams Canyon (% 928-738-2295) is a good place to shop for katsina
dolls and other crafts.

Along Old Route 66
When you drive the stretch of I-40 that borders southern American
Indian country from its intersection with Highway 191 to its eastern
approach to Flagstaff, the journey itself — or, more precisely, the road —
is the attraction. With the exception of Petrified Forest National Park
and Meteor Crater Natural Landmark, this area’s main draw is old
Route 66, which runs roughly parallel to I-40, the highways that
bypassed the road in 1965.
The first highway stretching from Chicago to California, Route 66 repre-
sented the lure of the West to many. John Steinbeck dubbed this early
freeway the “Mother Road.” Lined with neon signs and classic kitsch
storefronts, Route 66 embodies tourism nostalgia.
The region’s two main towns, Holbrook and Winslow, straddle Old Route
66, and make good, economical bases for exploring American Indian
Country (in Holbrook, Route 66 is called Hopi Drive; in Winslow, the
Mother Road goes under the name 2nd Street).
You may cover this area in a single day if you just want to hit the main
sights, but Winslow’s La Posada Hotel (see the “Spending the night” 
section later in this chapter) is itself a good reason to make this an
overnight stay.
You’re off the reservations here. All the usual rules apply.
Getting there
Pretty much everything you want to see in this area is off an I-40 exit
ramp. See “The Hopi Mesas,” earlier in this chapter, for the roads that
feed into I-40 from the north.
From Phoenix, Highway 87, the old Beeline Highway, is the most direct
route northeast to Winslow. This scenic road, which winds through the
piney White Mountains, is not for the faint-of-heart in some stretches. If
you take Highway 87, be sure to stop at Tonto Natural Bridge State
Park.
Route 66 was also a major rail route for the old Atcheson, Santa Fe, and
Topeka line, and Amtrak (% 800-872-7245; www.amtrak.com) now stops
at the original station in Winslow, next door to the terrific La Posada
Hotel. Prefer the bus? Greyhound (% 800-231-2222; www.greyhound.
com) offers service from Phoenix to Winslow. If you arrive by train or bus,
you may rent a car at Winslow Ford (% 928-289-3354).
Spending the night
Motel franchises replaced most of the funky Route 66 lodgings in
Holbrook and Winslow, although some great old neon signs announce
some not so great (I suspect) old rooms for $20 per night. The chains 
Chapter 18: Northeast Arizona: Hopi and Navajo Country 425

in Holbrook include two Best Westerns, Budget Inn, Comfort Inn, Day’s
Inn, Econo Lodge, Holiday Inn Express, Motel 6, Ramada Limited, and
Super 8. In Winslow, Comfort Inn, Day’s Inn, Econo Lodge, Holiday Inn
Express, Motel 6, Super 8, and Travelodge are available. See the
Appendix for the chains’ toll-free numbers.
The towns are only about 25 minutes from one another, so your choice
may depend on which of the following two lodgings appeals most to you
(though there’s a bit more to do in Holbrook).
La Posada

Winslow
Charles Lindbergh and Clark Gable were among the glitterati who bunked
at this grand Spanish rancho–style hotel, which Mary Colter designed in
1930 for the Santa Fe Railway (see Chapter 17). The individually decorated
rooms, gardens, and ornately detailed lobby have been beautifully
restored, and the place just keeps getting better and better. Fast becoming
a destination for far-flung history buffs, La Posada also draws locals to its
excellent restaurant (see the following “Dining locally” section), retro-chic
martini lounge, and great gift shop. And La Posada is a bargain; it’s tough
to get this much character for these prices anywhere else.

You don’t have a lot of options, but fans of down-home Mexican food will
be happy in Holbrook, while gourmands have a great getaway in Winslow.
I haven’t had a chance to eat at Holbrook’s Butterfield Stage Co. ($$–$$$),
609 W. Hopi Dr. (% 928-524-3447), but I like the Old West atmosphere and
hear the steak is good. Plenty of fast-food places are available in both

You come to this classic Route 66 town, with one of the country’s few
remaining wigwam motel courts (see the “Spending the night” section ear-

main drag, to ogle the kitsch and browse the shops selling rocks, petrified
wood, and Mother Road-o-bilia (see the “Shopping for local treasures” sec-
tion later in this chapter). The town’s one real sight is, conveniently, also
its visitor center: a free historical museum in the 1898 Navajo County
Courthouse, containing replicas of an early drugstore/soda fountain and a
jail cell replete with prisoner graffiti. The courthouse is also the place to
pick up a free self-guided-tour pamphlet detailing the other historical
buildings in Holbrook. On summer weekday nights, Indian dances are per-
formed in front of the courthouse from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m.

Meteor Crater
West of Winslow
I find it annoying that this privately owned hole-in-the-ground is fronted
by a cheesy rock shop and costs $15 to see. But nowhere else do you get
such a graphic view of what could — and did — happen if a meteorite were
to strike Earth. Talk about deep impact: The mega-million-ton hunk of rock
that hurtled down at a speed of 45,000 mph about 50,000 years ago left a
hole 570 feet deep and wide enough to fit 20 football fields. NASA used this
place to test moonwalks, as the films and exhibits at the museum and vis-
itor center show. You can’t enter the crater but you may take an hour-long
guided hike along the rim trail (daily 9:15 a.m.–2:15 p.m., every hour,
weather permitting) and peer at the crater through telescopes.

Petrified Forest National Park
East and southeast of Holbrook
Reality check: Don’t expect to see a turned-to-stone version of Redwood
National Forest (like I did the first time I visited). The petrified wood is in
log form and it lies on the ground. And, although this park has magnificent
vistas of the Painted Desert at its north end, this area isn’t the only place
that offers you views of that multihued sandstone wonderland. 
The Painted Desert begins east of the Grand Canyon; if you come from that
direction, you experience great stretches of it.
That said, if you leave behind unreasonable expectations, you should
enjoy this 93,500-acre park, as remarkable for its past as for its present. At
the Rainbow Forest Museum and Visitor Center, you see vestiges of the
days when the park was a forest primeval roamed by dinosaurs. “Gertie,”
an ancestor of the tyrannosaurus, about the size of a crocodile, is one of
the three, kid-pleasing, Triassic period dino skeletons on display, along
with fossils of other animals and plants. The area’s human history, dating
back more than 2,000 years, is evident at sites like Newspaper Rock, with
its large concentration of petroglyphs, and the Puerco Pueblo, home to
many rock artists until A.D. 1400. And the Painted Desert Inn, built in 1924
and a favorite spot for motorists tooling Route 66, is slated for restoration,
as is a remnant of the Mother Road itself.
A 28-mile road with more than 20 overlooks connects the park’s two visi-
tor centers. If you’re on a mission, you can complete the drive in less than
an hour. If you can spare a bit more time and arrive in the morning, start
out from the south end. Peruse the Rainbow Forest visitor center and
museum, stroll the three easy self-guided trails, and stop at the scenic
overlooks. By the time you reach the Painted Desert Visitors Center in the
north, you’re ready for lunch at the cafeteria or a picnic at nearby Kachina
Point (where you can also visit the museum in the Painted Desert Inn).

Winslow
This town’s stretch of Route 66 doesn’t offer nearly as many nostalgia-
inducing shops and signs as Holbrook’s, but you have a couple of ways to
spend your time:
 Take it easy. So many people asked about the fictional Winslow
intersection immortalized by the Eagles in the song “Take It Easy”
that the “Standin’ on the Corner” park was dedicated at 2nd and
North Kinsley streets in 1999. Highlight: John Pugh’s trompe l’oeil
mural, complete with a girl in a flatbed Ford, permanently slowed
down to take a look at you.
 Get your kicks. Much of the Route 66 stuff missing from the streets
of Winslow seems to have ended up at the free Old Trails Museum,
212 N. Kinsley St. (% 928-289-5861; Mon–Sat 8a.m.–5 p.m.) You
also see artifacts from the town’s heyday as a hub for the Santa Fe
Railway, much of it derived from La Posada Hotel (see the “Spending
the night” earlier in this section). Even without all its original plates
and cutlery (many of which are on display at the museum), La
Posada is also well worth touring; pick up a self-guided pamphlet 
in the lobby ($2).
Make a splash. Some 5 miles from downtown Winslow (take Route
87 south to Highway 99, and turn left), the McHood Park and Clear
Creek Reservoir is a great spot to kick back and fish for trout and
catfish, or to swim in fresh water, and enjoy a picnic by the shore.
This is not a strikingly scenic spot, but it’s a nice place to come if
you’ve got kids who need to expend some energy — or if you need

You wooden, wood you?
Despite the posted warnings and the testimonials from people who claim that cadging
wood from the Petrified Forest ruined their lives — check out the wonderful collection
of cautionary “I’ve been hexed” letters in the Rainbow Forest Museum’s “Guilt Book” —
some 12 tons of fossilized wood are stolen from the Petrified Forest every year. Resist the
temptation. You can buy as much hard wood as you like in Holbrook, hex-free.

just to stare out into the middle distance with a rod and reel in hand.
For more information, contact the Winslow Chamber of Commerce
and Visitors Center (see “Fast Facts” later in this section).
More cool things to see and do
In this part of the world, you may enjoy being between a rock and a
windy place.
 See an array of rock art. You can visit an incredible array of pic-
tographs and petroglyphs at Rock Art Canyon Ranch at Chevelon
Canyon, about 15 miles south of I-40 between Holbrook and Winslow
(% 928-288-3260). The ranch also has the last remaining bunkhouse
of the Hashknife Outfit, the largest U.S. ranching operation in the
19th century, as well as museums featuring 19th-century farm imple-
ments and ancestral Puebloan artifacts. Call in advance to get a
brochure with a map and to arrange to meet owner Brantley Baird at
the ranch house. He points out the highlights of the canyon, which
you can explore on your own (you must be accompanied on tours 
of the ranch museums). Prices depend on the number of people
coming on a particular day and what they’re interested in seeing (if
it’s only two, say, who just want to go directly to the canyon, you
may pay $20 a person). See map p. 395.
 Get windswept in the ruins. You may explore more than 300
remains of ancestral Puebloan dwellings at Homolovi Ruins State
Park, 3 miles northeast of Winslow (% 928-289-4106; www.pr.
state.az.us/parks/parkhtml/homolovi.html). It’s hard to
imagine that people lived on this rather bleak plain, where the
winds always seem to howl. Several hiking trails lead through the
ruins, which include prehistoric pit houses, 14th-century pueblos,
and a variety of petroglyphs. To get to the park, take I-40 to Exit
257; then go 11⁄3 miles north on Highway 87. Access to the ruin sites
is available 365 days a year during daylight hours; the visitor center
open daily 8 a.m–5 p.m. except Christmas Day. Fees, which run
around $5 per vehicle for up to four adults for day use, are subject
to change; call ahead. See map p. 395.

Is that a flute, or are you 
just happy to see me?
Like the howling coyote, Kokopelli, the hunchbacked flute player, is ubiquitous in
Southwest shops, appearing on everything from candlesticks to chandeliers. In fact,
he’s such a cliché by now that the more times he turns up in a store, the tackier it’s
likely to be. But many of the ancient rock art versions of Kokopelli found throughout the
region show him to be no innocent piper. A fertility symbol, he’s often depicted with a
phallus nearly as prominent as his flute.

Shopping for local treasures
Petrified wood, fossils, and Route 66 memorabilia are Holbrook’s special-
ties. Julien’s Roadrunner, 109 W. Hopi Dr. (% 928-524-2388), carries
lots of good Mother Road T-shirts and road signs, and Jim Gray’s
Petrified Wood Company, 147 E. Hwy. 180 (% 928-524-1842), carries 
an excellent selection of — well, I don’t really have to tell you, do I? For
high-quality Native American jewelry, baskets, and other crafts, don’t
miss McGees, 2114 E. Navajo Blvd. (% 928-524-1876). A local landmark,
Jack Rabbit Trading Post, near Joseph City between Winslow and
Holbrook (take Exit 269 off I-40, % 928-288-3230), is a Route 66 classic,
loaded with Mother Road kitsch and more rocks. Get yourself pho-
tographed with the giant namesake rabbit in the parking lot. In Winslow,
Moore’s, 1020 W. 3rd St., (% 928-289-3871), a combination (used) hard-
ware store and pawnshop, offers a great selection of turquoise-studded
Navajo bracelets and necklaces. Roadworks, 101 W. 2nd St. (% 928-289-
5423), is the town’s central repository for Route 66 items, including lots
of “Standing On a Corner” stuff.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
T
he parts of this book are like children — you pour your
heart into getting them to be the best they can, and then
they go out into the world (the ingrates!) — so I don’t like to
play favorites, but sufﬁce it to say this one has loads of per-
sonality and is very organized to boot. It consists of three fun
topics — crafts, local quirks, and food — presented in a “top
ten” format. What’s not to like?

Chapter 19
The Top Ten Crafts to 
Buy in Arizona
In This Chapter
 Getting Native American goods
 Wrangling Western wares
 Seeking out south-of-the-border stuff
S
hopping for crafts is one of Arizona’s great recreational activities,
but don’t let anyone try to tell you that it doesn’t involve skill.
Identifying the best items to buy and the best places to find them takes
savvy sleuthing — or scanning the following list. What did it take for a
craft to make my top ten list?
 Provenance: I concentrate on items either indigenous to Arizona 
or — if nothing like it is made in the state — to immediate neigh-
bors New Mexico and Mexico. (Sorry, nothing from Nevada; I figure
you have enough fuzzy dice.)
 Portability or shipability: Why buy something special that’s not
going to arrive home intact or is prohibitively expensive to send
safely?
 Value for money: Some of the items I recommend are quite costly,
but these are investments both in works of art and continuing 
traditions.
In general, if you want to be sure that a Native American craft is genuine
rather than mass-produced or a cheap knockoff, look for the artisan’s
name on the piece or ask the seller, who should be able to tell you. Small
irregularities are also a tip-off that an item is handmade.
For a preview of Hopi crafts and their prices, log on to www.hopimarket.
com. For a quick introduction to Navajo rugs, check out http://navajo-
arts.com/navojo-rugs.html. Guide to Southwest Indian Arts and
Crafts by Susanne and Jake Page (Random House) is an excellent all-
around resource, and Phoenix’s Heard Museum (see Chapter 11) is the
best single stop in the state if you’re interested in Native American crafts.

To find out more about goods created south of the border, get a hold of
Arts and Crafts of Mexico by Chloë Sayer (Chronicle Books, 1990).
Hopi Katsina Dolls
To the Hopi people, katsinas (pronounced kat-see-nuhs, and less accu-
rately termed kachinas) are the spiritual aspect of all material phenom-
ena, including plants, animals, rain — you name it. More than 400 different
kinds exist. Naturally, when in spirit form, you can’t see them, but their
representations are made visible through such items as ceremonial masks,
headgear, costumes worn by katsina dancers, and, most famously, dolls.
Katsina dolls were (and still are) used as toys and teaching tools for
young girls, but craftspeople now make many katsinas to be sold to out-
siders as well. Hopi katsinas are intricately carved and painted and
always made of cottonwood root; knockoffs are generally cruder and
created from other materials. Buy these dolls on the Hopi mesas (see
Chapter 18), either directly from the artisans or at one of the small
shops, in order to guarantee authenticity and good prices. The smallest
katsina dolls start around $50, and you may pay $500 or more for larger,
more detailed figures.
Hopi Overlay Silverwork
A relatively new craft (originating in the mid-1950s), Hopi overlay silver-
work is just what is sounds like: intricate designs are cut with a fine tool
out of a flat layer of silver, which is soldered onto a second layer that is
approximately the same size but slightly thinner. Both layers are oxi-
dized, but only the top layer is polished, which makes it stand out in
contrast with the black layer below. The back may be (but isn’t always)
stamped with a personal hallmark — usually the artist’s name or clan
symbol — and you can expect to find a “sterling” stamp (unless of course,
the item is made of gold, which some of the younger artists are now
using). This double-layered silver is fashioned into decorative items —
everything from earrings to watch bands and belt buckles — as varied
as the Hopi universe-oriented designs. The Hopi mesas (see Chapter 18)
are the best places to buy this work, but you can find good pieces through-
out the state. Prices start around $15 for a simple pair of earrings and go
up from there.
Navajo Rugs
The 300-year history of Navajo rugs is a cultural barometer of the lives
of their creators. In the 19th century, western traders influenced the
design of the rugs, encouraging the Navajos to create patterns that
would sell well to Anglos. Many of the distinct designs you find today —
for example, Two Grey Hills, Crystal, and Ganado Red — are named for
Part V: The Part of Tens 
436

the trading posts where they originated. The colors used in Navajo rugs
vary widely, and most of the patterns are abstract and purely decorative.
Some rugs weave tall, skinny figures into their designs representing yeis,
supernatural healers. Other rugs show yeibichais (look for the uplifted
feet), Navajo dancers dressed as yei spirits. Rugs with pictorial scenes
depict life on the reservation; details may include anything from pickup
trucks to soda machines. You pay a lot for the genuine item — rugs start
around $350 and go well into the thousands. Large, antique rugs fetch
upward of $25,000. Ironically, now that the rugs are becoming prized for
their great artistry, few skilled artisans are left. Most of the younger
Navajos abandoned weaving for more potentially lucrative professions.
You can trust the authenticity of anything you buy at the Hubbell
Trading Post in Ganado (see Chapter 18), the Cameron Trading Post
near the Grand Canyon (see Chapter 17), and at Garland’s Navajo Rugs
in Sedona (see Chapter 16), all of which have wide selections.
Navajo Silverwork
Navajo silversmithing began in the mid–19th century as a vehicle for
incorporating much-prized pieces of turquoise — traditionally a lucky,
healing stone — into decorative items such as necklaces and belts.
These days, many pieces, especially wide bracelets, belt buckles, and
squash blossom necklaces (the ones with the horseshoe-shaped pen-
dants), still incorporate the blue stone, although coral is used, too. You
may also find intricate designs on plain silver concha (shell-style) belts,
earrings, and bracelets. Navajo silverwork is single layer, unlike that of
the Hopi. Braided silver is common, too, especially in antique pieces.
You find good pieces at trading posts and crafts shops all over the Navajo
reservation (see Chapter 18). Some of the older, heavily turquoise-studded
ones are sold near the reservation in towns such as Flagstaff, Winslow,
and Holbrook. Some of the most creative work is exported to Native
American crafts boutiques in Greater Phoenix (see Chapter 11) and
Tucson (see Chapter 13). Prices range widely, starting at about $20 for
small earrings and going up to the thousands for the larger items. For
newer work, check for markings (sometimes in ink) with the artist’s
name and for a stamp that says, “sterling.” Antique work may not have
those signs of authenticity.
Zuni Carvings (Fetishes)
A fetish is a kind of talisman or personal charm. All tribes in the Southwest
make use of fetishes, but the Zuni, a New Mexico Puebloan people closely
related to the Hopi, are particularly renowned for their skill at carving
these small figurines. According to legend, certain animals — mountain
lions, bears, badgers, wolves, eagles, and moles — serve as protectors,
as healers, and as messengers to and from the spirit world. The Zuni
Chapter 19: The Top Ten Crafts to Buy in Arizona 437

people wear small stone representations of these sacred animals, believed
to contain their spirits, for protection from harm and to assure success.
The stones made for sale to non-Indians (the Zunis allude to them as
“carvings” rather than fetishes) aren’t imbued with any religious signifi-
cance. The Zunis make these crafts out of a variety of carvable, colorful
stones, including such semiprecious ones as turquoise, alabaster, and
lapis. Because they’re not native to Arizona, you don’t find Zuni carvings
in any particular place in the state; most reputable Native American
crafts shops sell them, however. Prices start around $15 and rarely go
beyond $50.
Tohono O’odham Baskets
The Tohono O’odham (pronounced tuh-ho-noh ah-ah-tem) people, whose
reservation near Tucson is the second largest in the United States (after
that of the Navajo), are the most prolific basket makers in the Southwest.
Their traditional coiled baskets are prized for their artistry as well as for
the complicated process involved in making them. To collect the natural
materials used — willow, yucca, devil’s claw (for the black color), and
bear grass, to name a few — the Tohono O’odham often travel far and in
different seasons. The labor is careful and painstaking, too, so don’t be
surprised that small baskets start around $200. The “Man in the Maze”
design, which depicts a small figure at the head of a circular labyrinth, is
the main tribal symbol. You may find several other patterns, including
linked friendship dancers and a variety of desert plants and critters
(even scorpions and snakes look charming when they’re woven).
Locating these baskets is easiest in Tucson (see Chapter 13), at shops sell-
ing Native American crafts, and at San Xavier Plaza. San Xavier Plaza is
directly across from the San Xavier Mission, built for the Tohono O’odham
people centuries ago and still their prime place of worship. The largest
selection, however, is at the gift shop at Kitt Peak National Observatory
(see Chapter 14), which leases its lofty plot from the tribe. The baskets —
and additional information about them — are also available on the
Tohono O’odham Community Action website, www.tocaonline.org.
Bola Ties
Arizona can’t lay claim to having invented such standard Western items
as cowboy boots or saddles — most of them are actually of Spanish/
Mexican origin — but the state can take credit for the classic Western
string tie. In Wickenburg in 1949, as the story goes, Vic Cedarstaff caught
a glimpse of his cowboy hat’s “stampede strings” lying across his shoul-
ders. He fixed the strings around his neck with an oval clasp of turquoise
and silver and called his tie a “piggin’ necklet.” For obvious reasons, 
that didn’t catch on. Then he changed the name to “bola” — short for
boleadora, a rope contraption used for reigning in cattle in South
America — and a trend was born. Turquoise and silver remain the 
Part V: The Part of Tens 
438

most popular fastener materials, although styles vary from copper to
plastic and designs include everything from corporate logos to replicas
of the state of Texas (where they no doubt claim they invented the tie).
The bola was declared Arizona’s official state neckwear in 1971.
Bola ties make great gifts for both men and women (worn with a simple,
tailored shirt, a bola makes a nice stand-in for a necklace). You find them
at every Western store and practically every Native American crafts
shop in the state; both the Hopi and Navajo fashion bolas with elabo-
rately designed silver clasps. Prices start around $15 for mass-produced
ones and go up from there depending on the materials used and artistry
involved. Just don’t buy one anywhere that uses the spelling “bolo” —
you need to draw the line in the sand somewhere.
Western-Style Leatherwork
Unless you own a horse, you probably won’t want to tote a saddle home.
You’re unlikely to use a full set of chaps (except maybe at some leather
bars with a cowboy bent), but other hand-tooled, stitched, studded, and
stamped leather items say “West” in a way most people can use. Belts,
wallets, purses, and briefcases are the most obvious choices. If you’re
looking for purely decorative items, you may consider a holster. Factory-
made leatherwork is sold all over the state. If you want the real thing,
follow the horse trail — although not literally, that could get messy — 
to places like Wickenburg (see Chapter 12), Tucson (see Chapter 13),
and southeast Arizona (see Chapter 15) where ranching still goes on.
Check out William Brown Holster Co. in Tombstone (see Chapter 15)
and Ben’s Saddlery in Wickenburg; elsewhere, check the Yellow Pages
under “Leather” and look for places that have “saddlery” in their names.
Secondhand or antiques stores can also be a good source of leatherwork
if you don’t mind it a bit worn (just call it “broken in”). Estimating prices
is difficult; these items are labor intensive, and good leather doesn’t
come cheap. Expect to shell out at least $35 for something small — and
without studs — like a wallet.
Mexican Tinwork
For inexpensive gifts, especially around the holidays, you may be hard-
pressed to find anything as pleasing as Mexican tinwork. The colorful
painted ornaments are a particularly good choice. They come in delight-
ful, sometimes surprising shapes: angels, tropical fish, cactus, parrots,
armadillos, cheerful Day of the Dead skeletons engaged in all manner 
of activities — most not overtly religious in subject matter. In Nogales,
Mexico (see Chapter 15), where practically every shop sells tinwork
items, these ornaments cost about $1.50 each, but at even twice or
quadruple the price in crafts stores in Tucson (see Chapter 13) or Greater
Phoenix (see Chapter 11), they’re still a bargain. Also interesting and
very transportable are the unpainted tin ex-votos (votive offerings)
Chapter 19: The Top Ten Crafts to Buy in Arizona 439

called milagros (literally, “miracles”). These small, charmlike representa-
tions of arms, legs, eyes, hearts, and other body parts that may be cured
through divine intervention are often sold inexpensively in bins for about
75¢ each. You may also find milagros incorporated into works of devo-
tional folk art in Mexico and southern Arizona.
Piñatas
Dating back to the days of the Aztecs, piñatas have been a mainstay at
Hispanic celebrations for centuries. These hollow papier-mâché sculp-
tures, stuffed with candy and toys, are great energy releasers for chil-
dren. The kids are blindfolded and spun around, and then they try to
whack the piñata open with a stick. Piñatas are increasingly popular
with other cultures, too (even Hallmark puts out a line now, and at
www.pinatas.com, you can find Hanukkah-themed versions). If you
want the authentic item, go to the source: Mexico, or the Mexican-
American communities in southern Arizona. Just comb the stalls in
Nogales (see Chapter 15) or check Phoenix and Tucson Yellow Pages
under “Party Supplies.”
Piñatas come in a variety of shapes — from the traditional donkeys to
the latest cartoon characters — and can be custom designed. (I once
saw a piñata version of a pink 1957 Chevy convertible.) The Guinness
Book of World Records lists one that’s 27 feet high and weighs 10,000
pounds, but most are a lot more portable and affordable. Prices start
around $9 in Mexico and $15 in the states — of course you pay consider-
ably more for something like that Chevy. Piñatas can be a bit bulky, but
smallish ones are available. And what other item can you promise the
kids they can break just as soon as they get home?

Arizona’s Top Ten 
Desert Denizens
In This Chapter
 Discovering Arizona’s desert dwellers
 Getting to know the good, the bad, the ugly, and the creepy-crawly
T
he Sonoran and the Chihuahuan deserts, which spread across south-
ern Arizona, are home to all kinds of creatures that love the hot, dry
climate or have adapted over the years to live here. This chapter presents
ten of the more exotic critters you’re likely to encounter — although not
necessarily up close and personally and almost definitely not in your
hotel room. Want to know more? One of the best places (aside from frat
bars) to learn about local animal life is Tucson’s Arizona-Sonora Desert
Museum (see Chapter 13), where you can view the creatures described
here in their habitats — and at a safe distance.
Coyotes
The coyote — a type of wild dog roughly the size of a German shepherd —
is the speedster of the canid species: It can sprint up to 40 mph and
cover several hundred miles in a single night. Coyotes are social, often
traveling in packs, and they’re domestic: They mate for life, and the pups
often hang out with their folks for more than a year. In addition, the
coyote is very intelligent and has a larger, more sophisticated vocabu-
lary than that of any other type of dog, communicating through growls,
whines, yips, barks, and howls, as well as such body language as tail
wagging, lip curling, and mock fighting. The most distinctive of the
coyote’s calls — a series of barks and yelps followed by a drawn-out
howl and a few short, sharp yaps — is used to gather group members
together before or after a hunt. Its verbal nature has earned the coyote
the name “song dog” in several Native American languages.
These animals keep to themselves during the day, so you may not see
any, but you’re very likely to hear them at night. And, no, coyotes don’t
wear bandanas.

Hummingbirds
Southern Arizona is hummingbird heaven; nowhere else in North
America can you find such a wide variety — as many as 22 species.
These adorable birds flit and hover, helicopter-like, around flowers —
but what they’re actually doing is pigging out. With the highest meta-
bolic rate of any warm-blooded vertebrate, hummingbirds eat all day
long to keep from starving.
Jackrabbits and Desert Cottontails
You’re most likely to see jackrabbits and their cousins, the desert cot-
tontails (the latter’s ears are smaller, and they have cute, fluffy tails),
hopping around at dawn or dusk. Both types are constant noshers; they
nibble voraciously on a variety of plants, including cacti.
Javelinas
Also called collared peccaries, these animals resemble small wild boars —
although they’re not actually in the pig family (or related to spears, for
that matter). Their closest relative is, oddly enough, the hippo. Javelinas
are the desert version of raccoons: They like to root through the garbage
in the more remote housing developments. Several resorts in Greater
Phoenix and Tucson have resident javelina families. They’re cute, but
my, what big teeth they have (the better to nibble cactus, prickles and
all), so steer clear.
Lizards
Small, pinkish, and delicate geckos are notable for the round pads on their
fingers and toes — helpful in climbing the walls, literally. These lizards
are far more common — you may be relieved to hear — than the 2-feet-
long, black-and-orange-striped Gila monster. The largest native lizard in
the United States, the Gila monster is the only venomous animal pro-
tected by state law. Don’t be deceived by its placid, sluggish demeanor;
Gila monsters can bite with a vise-like grip. Pick one up, and you may
need to pry it off with a screwdriver, and then head for the nearest emer-
gency room. Gila monsters aren’t considered deadly to humans, but you
don’t really want to test that theory.
Quails
These chubby, plumed birds tend to cross the road together in family
groups called coveys. The mother quail shepherds her babies on outings.
These birds may also turn up on your dinner plate — but I won’t discuss
that here.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
442

Rattlesnakes
Arizona public relations people like to point out that rattlers are present
in nearly every state in the United States. However, said PR people aren’t
likely to mention the fact that the Southwest has more species of rat-
tlesnakes than does any other single region in the Americas. The good
news: Rattlers don’t really want to tussle with you; that rattling sound
means “go away.” Nor do they want to waste venom on you — you’re too
large to kill and eat. If you do get bit, chances are 50/50 that the bite is
dry (nonpoisonous). The bottom line: Watch where you step in the wild,
but don’t make yourself miserable with worry. You’re 20 times more
likely to be struck by lightning than to be bit by a rattlesnake.
Roadrunners
I spotted one of these large (about two-feet-long), crested birds sprinting
across the parking lot of my accountant’s office in Tucson. I’ve never
seen one being pursued by a coyote, however, or heard one go “beep,
beep” — and neither will you. Roadrunners eat rattlesnakes whole, they
prefer to run rather than fly, and they can sprint as fast as 15 mph.
Scorpions
These miniature lobsters like to hang out in dark, dry spots. All varieties
are nearly invisible in the dark (although they glow under ultraviolet light).
If your shoes have been under your bed all night, shake them out before
sticking your feet back into them. The scorpion’s bite is painful, but not
dangerous. Their sting is venomous, but they only sting humans in self-
defense, and most species’ stings just cause a painful swelling. The excep-
tion (out of the 30 species common to Arizona) is the small bark scor-
pion, which can cause convulsions and, occasionally, heart failure. Log
on to http://ag.arizona.edu/urbanipm/scorpions/scorpions.
html to find out about its distinguishing characteristics.
Spiders
Big, hairy tarantulas are the most conspicuous of the desert spiders, but
they’re harmless — honest; some people even keep them as pets. The
spiders you really want to give a wide berth are the much smaller, but
far more poisonous black widows. A black widow spider’s bite can be
deadly, but, fortunately, they’re not aggressive; just don’t go poking your
fingers in their faces or into dark corners. You can recognize the ven-
omous females by the bright red, hourglass-shaped markings on their
chests.

T
he beans are black; the corn is blue. Arizonans sometimes eat cacti
and prepare their steaks dry — on purpose. No wonder the local 
cuisine, with its strong Native American and Mexican influences, may
occasionally seem a little strange to outsiders. But familiarity breeds
contentment when it comes to food; you’re likely to enjoy Arizona spe-
cialties, too, once you figure out exactly what you’re eating.
Beans
Beans play a large role in northern Mexican and cowboy cooking alike
(the famous campfire scene from Blazing Saddles may come to mind).
Arizona has beans in any form you can imagine. Kidney beans are cooked
in tangy barbecue sauce and served with ribs, chicken, and the like in
casual steakhouses. Chic New Southwestern restaurants embrace the
rich, smoky-flavored black bean (also known as the turtle bean) for soups
and dips. Frijoles — the Mexican-menu bean of choice — are more com-
monly called pintos and turn up as refritos, which are refried and topped
with cheese.
Beef
Arizona does steaks in all cuts and sizes — this was, after all, cattle
country not so long ago — with preparations ranging from roadside pan-
fried to big-city butter sautéed. The most common (and most delicious)
way to get your big meat fix, however, is mesquite-grilled.

In the days before ice cube–dispensing refrigerators with double freezers,
dried meat was a staple of the Southwest diet. That tradition lives on in
statewide convenience stores, where beef jerky sits next to the cash 
registers. And dehydrated beef also comes in a much more palatable,
Mexican variety: Carne seca, which is sun-dried, shredded, and spiced
before being sautéed, often fills tacos, burritos, and enchiladas.
Bread
Forget sourdough, wheat, or doughy white. Sure, Arizona has those
breads, but what the state does best is tortillas (mostly corn and flour,
although yuppie whole-wheat versions have snuck in) and Indian fry
bread (flat discs of deep-fried dough served with a variety of toppings).
When lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, and ground beef are piled on fry bread,
you have a Navajo taco — similar to the Mexican variety, only flat.
Another Native American specialty is piki bread, a delicate, flaky variety
made from blue cornmeal (see “Corn,” below) and baked over a hot
stone. Piki bread is generally only available on the Hopi reservation.
Cacti
No, Arizonans don’t eat all kinds of cacti, and we don’t eat the spines,
but pretty much everything else is fair game on the prickly pear cactus.
The plant’s tender young pads, called nopales, turn up on Mexican
menus in southern Arizona, mostly sliced and diced and scrambled with
eggs. Occasionally, nopales are roasted or served marinated in salads.
Supermarkets also sell them as nopalitos — small pickled strips. Nopales
don’t really have a strong taste; they’re similar to okra (which they
resemble in texture, too, unfortunately). The good news: Nopales are
loaded with vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and amino acids, and
they’re even touted as diet aids because their fibers slow down diges-
tion. The sweet, kiwi-size fruit of the prickly pear, filled with seeds, is
called a tuna (although nothing’s fishy about it). Ranging in color from
pale pink and lavender to deep red, tunas are made into jams, jellies,
marinades, and sweet syrup (often used to create a colorful margarita).
Chiles
First things first: There’s no such thing as a chile pepper. According to
chef Mark Miller’s The Great Chile book, the mix-up dates back to
Christopher Columbus, who thought he had brought a new type of black
pepper to the Old World; he actually introduced a plant of an unrelated
genus, capsicum. Second, the chile plant is spelled with an e, not an i.
Chili, the stew made of meat and (sometimes) beans and usually con-
taining chiles, is a whole other food group — but not an Arizonan one.
(Talk to Texans if you want to talk chili.) Third, not all chiles are hot.
Chapter 21: Arizona’s Top Ten Food Groups 445

446 Part V: The Part of Tens 
The chiles you most often come across in Arizona are the fairly mild ana-
heims and poblanos, which tend to turn up stuffed (relleno). Anaheims
are also dried and strung together in chile strings known as ristras. The
medium-hot jalapeño (called chipotle when it’s dried and smoked) is
used in a lot of recipes, too. You sometimes find dishes that include ser-
ranos, farther up still on the heat scale (they’ve got a bit of an after-kick),
but you rarely encounter the incendiary habanero, estimated to be 30 to
50 times hotter than the jalapeño. Frankly, much as I hate to admit it,
Arizonans are generally wusses, chile-wise — especially when compared
with diners in New Mexico. No need to be scared of your salsa here.
Chimichangas
As opposed to Tex-Mex or New Mexican, Arizona’s version of Mexican
cuisine isn’t all that distinct from the hearty, cheese-smothered fare of
northern Mexico. Although filling and tasty, Arizona’s Mexican-inspired
edibles are not wildly exciting. This state did, however, originate two
excellent south-of-the-border spin-offs: the chimichanga and the topopo
salad (see the “Topopo Salad” section later in this chapter). The chimi —
as it’s known to its fans — consists of a large flour tortilla filled with
meat, deep-fried, and topped with guacamole, cheese, and salsa. Can
anything be more fattening — or yummy? Like that of the Caesar salad
and of the fajita, the exact genesis of the chimi is widely disputed, but El
Charro restaurant in Tucson stakes a pretty strong claim.
Cilantro
The herb derived from the lacy leaves of the coriander plant, also called
Chinese parsley, and related to the American kind, definitely rules.
Nothing says Mexican/Southwest like cilantro. Don’t be surprised if you
come across a menu item like crabmeat enchiladas with jalapeño-
cilantro pesto sauce, for example.
Some people absolutely despise cilantro, which is hard for the many
who adore its fresh, bracing taste to understand. Turns out, just as folks
have allergies to peanuts, dairy, and other foods, the body chemistry of
some people reacts with the herb so that it literally tastes like soap. If
you fall into this group (you’ll know the first time you try anything with
cilantro) and you dine at a Mexican or New Southwest restaurant, be
sure to ask your server if cilantro is included in a dish that you order.
Corn
Another New World food, corn is a staple of both American Indian and
Mexican diets. Corn turns up in everything from tortillas and piki bread

447
Chapter 21: Arizona’s Top Ten Food Groups
to soups and stews that use hominy (corn from which the hull and germ
have been removed). Even the husks (think tamales) are used by both
cultures.
The so-called Indian corn, with its multicolored kernels, is mostly deco-
rative these days, although one native corn hue has become synonymous
with Southwest food — blue. Grown by many Pueblo tribes and impor-
tant to the Hopi for whom it is part of a creation myth, blue corn isn’t
eaten on the cob, but is dried and ground into a cornmeal. This blue
cornmeal is somewhat more flavorful — and definitely more attractive —
than the regular kind. Chic Southwest chefs adore blue corn because it
exemplifies two key cooking tenets: drawing on local traditions and pro-
viding aesthetic pleasure. Expect to find blue corn tortilla chips or blue
corn taco shells on some of the state’s priciest plates.
Topopo Salad
No one’s exactly sure where the name came from, how the salad turned
up in Tucson, or why you won’t find topopo salad anywhere else. But
everyone pretty much agrees that the topopo salad is a treat. This 
dish comes in several variations, but generally, you can expect a crispy
corn tortilla spread with refried beans and topped with lettuce, tomato,
chicken, cheese, and often, sour cream (yep, this pig out is one you can
rationalize by saying, “But I only had a salad”). Most of Tucson’s South
Fourth Avenue Mexican restaurants list the topopo on their menus.
Vegetables
Lettuce is probably the most popular vegetable in the state. In fact, Yuma,
Arizona, is the country’s largest producer of the much-maligned iceberg
variety. Lettuce is particularly prized in its shredded form as a garnish
for cheese and beans in Mexican dishes. But squash is the darling of
New Southwest chefs, in part because it’s indigenous to the Western
hemisphere and in part because so many types of squash are unpro-
nounceable. For example, two favorite squashes are calabaza, a yellow
variety similar in sweetness and firmness to butternut squash, and chay-
ote, the mild-tasting (think cucumber), pear-size gourd that was a princi-
pal food of the Aztecs and the Mayas. Another veggie star is jicama
(that’s heek-uh-muh), a member of the root family most often used raw
in salads. Jicama has the crunchy consistency of a water chestnut but
with a sweeter taste.

Appendix
Quick Concierge
T
his handy section presents a wrap-up of the practical information
you need to plan a stress-free vacation — from A-to-Z facts to a
phone list of airlines and hotel chains — plus, if you’re an overachiever,
some additional resources to consult. Another bonus: You don’t need to
tip this concierge.
Fast Facts
AAA
For emergency road service, call % 800-
AAA-HELP (800-222-4357). To locate the AAA
offices in Arizona — most are in Greater
Phoenix, but two are also in Tucson and one
in Prescott — phone % 800-352-5382 or log
on to www.aaa-arizona.com.
ATMs
Automatic teller machines are everywhere
in Arizona — including, in some places,
drive-throughs — and all the major ATM
networks are represented. Locations for
branches in the Cirrus (% 800-424-7787;
www.mastercard.com) and Plus (% 800-
843-7587; www.visa.com) networks can be
found by calling the toll-free numbers or
checking the Internet.
Business Hours
Business hours vary throughout Arizona and
are often more relaxed — as in “I feel like
closing my store this afternoon, so I will” —
than in other parts of the country, but you
can use the following as a guideline. Note,
too, that business tends to be conducted on
the early, rather than the late side: You’re
likely to have better luck reaching someone
in an office at 8 a.m. than finding that person
at his or her desk a few minutes before 5 p.m.
Banks: Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. 
to 5 p.m. (in Greater Phoenix and Tucson,
many banks are also open on Saturday from
9 or 10 a.m. to noon or 1 p.m.). Retail stores:
Monday through Saturday from 9 or 10 a.m.
to 5 or 6 p.m.; malls usually stay open Monday
through Saturday until 9 p.m., and operate
Sundays from 10 a.m., 11 a.m., or noon until 
6 p.m. Bars: Most places don’t open their
doors until 11 a.m. or noon, but drinking
establishments are legally allowed to let
customers in Monday through Saturday from
6 a.m. to 2:30 a.m., Sunday from 10 a.m. to
2:30 a.m.
Credit Cards
MasterCard’s general information number is
% 800-307-7309. For Visa, call % 800-847-
2911.
Driving
The Arizona Department of Transportation
(ADOT) provides a handy number for you to
call to find out about road conditions through-
out the state: % 888-411-7623. Less handy
when you’re on the road but useful when

you’re heading out is the roadway condi-
tions section of the ADOT Web site
www.az511.com. See the “AAA” listing
earlier in this section for the numbers to
call for emergency road service.
Emergencies
In most parts of the state, call % 911 to
report a fire, contact the police, or get an
ambulance. The numbers for emergency
services on the Indian reservations are
given in the Fast Facts sections of Chapter
18, but you’re not likely to remember where
to find them in a hurry so just call 0 and
have the operator connect you.
Health
I can’t emphasize it too much: Wear sun-
screen and drink lots of water when you’re
traveling in Arizona. The sun is strong,
even in the north, and it’s surprisingly easy
to get sunburned and dehydrated in no
time. The major metropolitan areas have
excellent and plentiful medical facilities;
however, that’s not the case on the Native
American reservations in northeast Arizona,
where health centers are infrequent and
less modern. See Chapter 10 for additional
details on health-related matters, including
what to do in case of medical emergencies.
Information
See “Finding More Information,” at the end
of this appendix.
Internet Access and Cybercafes
You can access your e-mail at most Kinko’s
locations (check the telephone directory) in
Tucson and the Valley and at cybercafes in
several of the smaller cities; See Chapter 10
and the Fast Facts sections in the destina-
tion chapters for locations. In addition, the
public libraries in most towns allow visitors
to use their computers for Internet access,
gratis.
Liquor Laws
The legal age for buying or consuming alco-
holic beverages is 21. Hours to purchase
booze are the same as those of bars: You
can’t buy alcoholic drinks Monday through
Saturday between 2:30 to 6 a.m. and Sunday
between 2:30 and 10 a.m. Liquor stores
tend to have the most specialized selec-
tions, but you can get the hard stuff as well
as wine and beer at most major supermar-
kets and drugstores. Convenience stores
generally only sell beer and wine coolers.
Mail
To find the address and hours of operation
of the U.S. Post Office nearest you, phone
% 800-275-8777. Be prepared to know
what zip code you’re calling from.
Maps
Most gas stations, convenience stores,
and supermarkets sell maps, and they tend
to be better than the ones you can get at
the local tourist offices, although those
often indicate the popular tourist sights. If
you’re a member of AAA, you can also get
excellent maps in advance at your local
AAA office. Mapquest, www.mapquest.com,
can plot your route from point A to point B.
Mapquest is a good online resource if you
know exactly where you’re coming from
and where you’re going, but it’s no help for
the clue- or computer-less.
Newspapers/Magazines
See “Where to Get More Information,” at
the end of this appendix.
Safety
You need to take the usual common sense
precautions for your personal safety and
that of your belongings as you would any-
where else in the United States. In Arizona,
you also have to think about the road —
and the elements. See Chapter 7 for details
about driving around Arizona, and see the
Appendix: Quick Concierge 449

individual destination chapters for tips relat-
ing to touring desert or high-altitude areas.
Smoking
Arizona may look like Marlboro Country,
but not as many people light up in the state
as they did in the past. Some businesses
and public buildings ban smoking entirely,
and restaurants tend to have separate
smoking areas or restrict puffing to out-
door terraces. That said, only Tucson, and,
in Greater Phoenix, Tempe, and Mesa have
blanket laws against smoking in restaurants
or, in the case of Mesa and Tempe, all
public places, including bars. Everywhere
else, smoking policies are set on a busi-
ness-by-business basis.
Taxes
The state sales tax is 5.6 percent, and all
the individual counties and towns tack
additional tariffs on your purchases. You
usually won’t pay more than 81⁄2 percent on
anything you buy, however. Not so for car
rental taxes, which range from 10% to more
than 20 percent, or hotel room taxes, which
run from around 6 percent to 14 percent
(depending on which pet projects each city
decides to have tourists help finance —
but don’t say you read that here).
Time Zone
You gotta love a state ornery enough to
just say no to daylight saving time (DST) —
hey, the one thing we have more than
enough of is daylight — but bucking the
temporal tide does wreak havoc with our
time zones. Arizona is on mountain stan-
dard time, but when most of the country
goes on DST, the state is, in effect, on
pacific standard time. To compound the
confusion, the Navajo reservation does
observe DST, while the Hopi reservation,
which it encircles, doesn’t.
Weather Updates
For the best weather reports online —
replete with satellite pictures and loads of
other great trivia for meteorological
junkies — log on to the National Weather
Service Web site at www.wrh.noaa.
gov. Cable subscribers may also get the
Weather Channel, one of the more soporific
stations on TV when you tune in to Arizona,
where you usually find gradations of sunny,
sunnier, and sunniest. There’s no central
number for state weather reports; see the
Fast Facts sections of the destination chap-
ters for your preferred prognostication.

Where to Get More Information
Still want additional data — after all my hard work? Okay, this book
isn’t designed to cover everything, so this section shares a few more
resources. Now enough reading already. Start packing!
Tourist information
Call or write the Arizona Office of Tourism, 1110 W. Washington, Ste.
155, Phoenix, AZ 85007 (% 866-275-5816; www.arizonaguide.com),
for a copy of Arizona Official State Visitors Guide, a glossy publication
that details attractions, activities, and lodgings throughout the state.
You can also phone with specific questions. If the friendly representa-
tives can’t tell you what you want to know about the state, they can
refer you to someone who can. The office of tourism’s Web site is the
prime source of online information, with links to Arizona cities and
regions and to lots of special interest sites (for example, one for fami-
lies traveling with kids, another for scenic routes). See also the Fast
Facts sections of the destination chapters for the local tourism offices
and for additional useful Web sites.
Newspapers and magazines
If a peek at Arizona Highways magazine doesn’t make you want to visit
the state, nothing will; finding more spectacular photography any-
where would be hard (of course, the landscape lends a hand by being
incredibly photogenic). See Chapter 9 for information on photo work-
shops run by the magazine. Single copies are available at newsstands
and supermarkets in Arizona, or you can opt for a subscription; call

% 800-543-5432 for current rates ($21 for 12 issues in 2006). You can
also find an online teaser of the magazine at www.arizonahighways.
com. Newspapers and magazines relating to Greater Phoenix and
Tucson are detailed in the Fast Facts sections of Chapters 11 and 13.
State guides
Frommer’s Arizona (Wiley Publishing, Inc.) is a great complement to
this book, covering destinations that aren’t included in these pages
and offering additional details on many that are. Another excellent
resource is www.frommers.com, which is full of travel tips, online
booking options, and a daily e-mail newsletter filled with bargains and
travel advice.
