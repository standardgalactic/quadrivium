ties, about whom she writes in her weekly nightlife and gossip

Author’s Acknowledgments
Thanks to my parents, Arnold and Francine — without them, I
am nothing; to Aunt Trish, who knows more about schlepping
through Florida than anyone else I know; to Mrs. Ritchie, for
teaching me to aspire to greatness; to the publicists out there
who understand the importance of getting back to me; and to
all those who appreciate the humor and irony of my involve-
ment in this very book.

Introduction
E
ven those of you who, like me, reside in the Sunshine State feel as if
you’re on a permanent vacation, and it’s not just because of the sun,
the palm trees, and the ocean. Whether your passion involves water
sports, beach bathing, theme-park hopping, shopping, art and historical
sighting, or wining and dining, Florida offers a wealth of opportunities
for you to experience at your leisure.
Florida has come a long way since 1513, when Ponce de Leon landed and
alligators ate his men, and the natives sent their bon voyage wishes via
Flaming Arrow Express. From diving with dolphins to daring rides on
roller coasters that zoom from 0 to 60 mph in less than three seconds,
you’ll find experiences here like nowhere else on Planet Earth. If you’re
interested in the past, you can immerse yourself in St. Augustine, the
oldest city in the U.S. — but the Sunshine State also has plenty of attrac-
tions that can bring you tantalizingly close to the future. Florida’s theme
parks, especially those clustered around Orlando, are constantly trying
to out-duel each other with high-tech animatronics, virtual experiences,
and all-too-real thrill rides where you strap yourself in and pray your
bladder doesn’t become a stranger with a mind of its own. Miami’s siz-
zling South Beach offers some of the hottest nightlife on American soil.
Daytona Beach is world-renowned — or infamous, depending on your
point of view — for Bike Week and spring break. And, Destin and Fort
Walton Beach have miles of sand on which to tan your body.
Florida’s a big place, and your number-one priority should be navigating
your way through all the fun and sun without exhausting yourself —
after all, you are on vacation. All you need to ensure a great trip to
Florida is some patience, some advance planning, and some suntan
lotion — now how hard is that?
About This Book
With a little help from us, you won’t have to
 Do it anyone else’s way.
 Pay full price.
 Read the fine print.
There’s no need for any of that. You chose this book because you know
the For Dummies name and have probably already made your first 
decision — you’re thinking hard about a trip to Ponce de Leon’s favorite
flatland, Florida. You probably also know how much you want (or can
afford) to spend, the pace you want to keep, and how much planning

you can stomach. Most of y’all (forgive our Southern slang) also don’t
want to tend to every little detail. Yet you don’t trust just anyone to do it
for you. That’s why you’re reading this book.
My job is to boil down what, honestly, is a very long spit of real estate —
542 miles from Key West to Jacksonville, then left and westward 364
miles to Pensacola. (That doesn’t count most of the Gulf Coast!) At cur-
rent count, Florida has 16 million residents and five times that many
tourists per year — all crowded into about 22 percent of the land. The
rest of the state is pasture, swamp, and public land that most folks never
see. Because your time and money are valuable, I focus on the cities and
regions in Florida that deserve your attention. This book doesn’t cover
Florida comprehensively (that would require volumes). It highlights the
best Florida has to offer. I don’t worry you with the secondary stuff that,
although perfectly fine, isn’t up to snuff for most vacations.
How can anyone sort through that kind of mess, you ask? It takes experi-
ence. After stomping through the state for over a decade, I know where
to find the best deals (of the non-rip-off variety). In this book, I guide you
through Florida in a clear, easy-to-understand way, enabling you to find
the best hotels, restaurants, and attractions without having to read this
book like a novel — cover to cover. Although you can read every page if
you choose, you can also flip to only those sections that interest you. I
also promise not to overwhelm you with choices. I simply deliver the
best, most essential ingredients for a great vacation.
Conventions Used in This Book
To make this book an easier reference guide for you (and because
Florida does its best to make you max them out), we use the following
abbreviations for commonly accepted credit cards:
AE: American Express
CB: Carte Blanche
DC: Diners Club
DISC: Discover
JCB: Japan Credit Bank
Florida For Dummies, 3rd Edition

Dummies Post-it
® Flags
As you’re reading this book, you’ll find information that you’ll want to reference as you
plan or enjoy your trip — whether it be a new hotel, a must-see attraction, or a must-
try walking tour. Mark these pages with the handy Post-it® Flags included in this book
to help make your trip planning easier!

MC: MasterCard
V: Visa
I also include some general pricing information to guide you as you
decide where to unpack your bags or dine on the local cuisine. I’ve used
a system of dollar signs to show a range of costs for one night in a hotel
(the price refers to a double-occupancy room) or a meal at a restaurant.
(The room rates do not include taxes of up to 12 percent. The cost of
each meal is the main course only; so allow for the 6–7 percent sales tax,
as well as appetizers, drinks, or other extras you desire.) Check out the
following table to decipher the dollar signs:
Dollar Signs
Hotel
Restaurant
$
$99 or less
$14 or less
$$
$100–$199
$15–$24
$$$
$200–$249
$25–$39
$$$$
$250 or more
$40 or more
I’ve listed exact prices for every establishment, attraction, and activity,
but keep in mind that prices are subject to change.
In addition, I’ve divided the hotel listings into two categories — my per-
sonal favorites and those that don’t quite make my preferred list but still
get my hearty seal of approval. Don’t be shy about considering these
“runners up” hotels if you’re unable to get a room at one of my favorites
or if your preferences differ from mine — the amenities that the runners
up offer and the services that each provides make all these accommoda-
tions good choices to consider as you determine where to rest your
head at night.
For those hotels, restaurants, and attractions that are plotted on a map,
a page reference is provided in the listing information. If a hotel, restau-
rant, or attraction is outside the city limits or in an out-of-the-way area,
it may not be mapped.
Foolish Assumptions
As I wrote this book, I made some assumptions about you and what your
needs may be:
 You may be an inexperienced traveler trying to determine whether
to take a trip to Florida or looking for guidance to decide when and
how to make this trip.
 You may be an experienced traveler, but you don’t have much time
to devote to trip planning or to spend in Florida when you get here.
You want expert advice on how to maximize your time and enjoy a
hassle-free trip.
Introduction

 You’re not looking for a book that provides all the information
available on Florida or one that lists every hotel, restaurant, or
attraction in the state. Instead, you want a book that focuses on
places that give you the best or most unique experiences in the
Sunshine State.
If you fit any of these criteria, Florida For Dummies, 3rd Edition, gives
you the information you’re looking for!
How This Book Is Organized
Florida For Dummies is divided into seven parts. The chapters in each
part lay out the specific details of that part’s topic. Each chapter and part
is written so you don’t have to read what came before or after, though I
sometimes refer you to other areas for more information. Here’s a brief
look at the parts.
Part I: Introducing Florida
Think of this part as the hors d’oeuvre. In this part, I tempt you with the
best experiences, hotels, eateries, and attractions in Florida. I throw in a
weather forecast, look at special events, and then help you plan a budget.
I also provide special tips for families, seniors, travelers with disabilities,
and gay and lesbian travelers.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Florida
Should you use a travel agent? How about buying a package tour? Where
can you find the best airfare? In this part, I answer those questions and
also talk about the advantages — and disadvantages — of booking your
trip on the Internet as well as list some good online resources. In addi-
tion, I get into money matters, discussing whether you’re better off using
credit cards, ATMs, traveler’s checks, or cash. Before moving on, I tie up
some last-minute details and talk about travel insurance, car rental, and
packing tips.
Part III: South Florida
This part of the book deals with Miami, the Keys, the Everglades, Fort
Lauderdale, Palm Beach, and their ’burbs. I introduce the neighborhoods
and then explore some of the modus transporto (local buses, trolleys,
taxis, shuttles, and other vehicles to get you from hither to yon). I also
give you some advice on where to stay, where to eat, and which attrac-
tions to see. Finally, I profile the best shopping areas, present the best
clubs, and offer some suggested itineraries.
Part IV: The Gulf Coast
Florida’s left coast has pockets of development, particularly around the
Tampa Bay area, but the Gulf Coast is not nearly as cramped as the
Atlantic side. In this part, I introduce you to Tampa, St. Petersburg, and
Florida For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
4

the Gulf beaches and then venture south to Sarasota, Fort Myers, and
Naples. I include the region’s best accommodations, restaurants, attrac-
tions, shops, and clubs, as well as sightseeing itineraries.
Part V: Visiting Central Florida: Mickey Mania
So much is shoehorned into Orlando and the Walt Disney World area that
this section of Florida deserves its own part — three meaty chapters.
First off, I show you how to get there, profile the neighborhoods, and
present the best accommodations and eateries in town. Then I devote a
chapter to the major theme parks operated by Disney, Universal, and
SeaWorld. Last but not least, I present some of the smaller, cheaper, and
more relaxing attractions, explore shopping and partying venues and
then take side trips to the Kennedy Space Center and Cypress Gardens.
Part VI: The Great North
Except for a few development clusters — most notably along the upper
Atlantic Coast — North Florida is pretty wide-open. Most of the places
here are oriented more toward backpackers, paddlers, and cow tippers
than typical tourists. In Northeast Florida, I offer you a front-row seat in
the oldest city in the United States, St. Augustine, and explore Daytona
Beach, Amelia Island, Fernandina Beach, and Jacksonville. 
Part VII: The Part of Tens
Every For Dummies book has The Part of Tens. The appearance of this
part is as certain as annual rate increases at Florida’s theme parks. Here,
I give you parting advice on the state’s best beaches and foods.
You can also find an appendix, your “Quick Concierge,” which contains
lots of handy-dandy information you may need when traveling in Florida,
like phone numbers and addresses for emergency personnel or area hos-
pitals and pharmacies, protocol for sending mail, and more. Check out
this appendix when searching for answers to lots of little questions that
may come up as you travel.
Icons Used in This Book
Several icons (those little pictures in the margins) are scattered through-
out this guide. Consider them your road map for finding specific infor-
mation you may need.
The Best of the Best icon highlights the best Florida has to offer in all
categories — hotels, restaurants, attractions, activities, shopping, and
nightlife.
Find out useful advice on things to do and ways to schedule your time
when you see the Tip icon.
Introduction
5

Watch for the Heads Up icon to identify annoying or potentially danger-
ous situations, such as tourist traps, unsafe neighborhoods, budget
breakers, and other things to beware of.
I use the Kid Friendly icon to identify particularly family-friendly hotels,
restaurants, and other places, although most of Orlando is receptive to
small fry.
Keep an eye out for the Bargain Alert icon as you seek out money-saving
tips and/or other great deals.
The Natural Wonder icon highlights particularly noteworthy beaches,
parks, preserves, and other natural attractions in Florida, a state known
for its natural beauty.
Where to Go from Here
Okay. You know what to expect from this book and how to use it to plan
a sun-filled, fun-filled vacation to Florida. So, start reading. There’s much
to do before you arrive, from arranging a place to stay each night to
exploring the best beaches, attractions, and nightlife that Florida has to
offer. Like the Boy Scouts, the successful Florida traveler needs to be
prepared; follow the advice in this book, and you will be. And, last but
not least, have fun — this state was designed to bring sunshine into its
visitors’ lives, so you may as well enjoy it.

D
eciding on a vacation destination shouldn’t cause
angst, but making a few decisions now — before the
landing gear lowers — can help you get the most out of your
vacation. My goal in this part is to help you cut through the
ﬁrst wave of options that you encounter when deciding on a
Florida destination.
But before I do, you get to do a little dreaming about the pre-
mier experiences Florida offers, and the grand excursions you
can embark upon when you get there.

W
hether you prefer diving with dolphins, working on your suntan,
or gorging on great food, Florida’s wealth of activities, dining
opportunities, and entertainment can impress even the most jaded trav-
eler. Millions of visitors flock here each year, drawn by the promise of
warm winters, a bounty of beaches, and fabulous attractions — both
man-made and natural. But before I dive into the details, I review some
of Florida’s best places to stay, eat, and have fun. In these first pages, I
tell you about some of the things that convince snowbirds, families, hon-
eymooners, and outdoor enthusiasts to come here every year and, in the
process, I show you a few things that can fill your to-do list.
Of course, selecting the best from such a large, visitor-friendly state is no
easy job, and the choices I list here are simply some of the highlights.
You can discover hundreds of other hotels, restaurants, activities, and
attractions in the following chapters. And, dare I say, you’ll probably find
a few of your own after you arrive in the Sunshine State. Throughout the
book, the “Best of the Best” icon is attached to the places and activities
mentioned in this chapter.
I’m going to keep an ace in the hole and save my favorite Florida
beaches for Chapter 22, but for now, here are the all-stars.

The Best Fine-Dining Experiences
 Chef Allen’s (North Miami Beach; % 305-935-2900). This outstand-
ing Floribbean (a term used to describe the best of Caribbean and
Floridian cuisines’ offerings) restaurant boasts a show kitchen and
a menu that features goat-cheese-encrusted lamb chops and
mesquite-grilled soft-shell crabs. See Chapter 9. 
 Norman’s (Coral Gables; % 305-446-6767). A perennial award
winner thanks to such treats as venison au poivre and pork tender-
loin with Haitian grits, Norman’s is consistently one of So Flo’s best.
See Chapter 9.
 Louie’s Backyard (Key West; % 305-294-1061).This stellar, scenic
waterfront spot serves up grilled yellowfin tuna and spice-rubbed
venison while you watch a spectacular sunset. See Chapter 11. 
 Cap’s Place Island Restaurant (Lighthouse Point; % 954-941-0418).
This barge-turned-restaurant on a private island near Fort Lauderdale
offers the total South Florida experience, serving excellent, reason-
ably priced seafood. And there’s a bonus: The boat ride to the restau-
rant is free. See Chapter 13.
 Euphemia Haye (Longboat Key; % 941-383-3633). This cozy culi-
nary standout offers unique continental cuisine and a romantic
atmosphere. See Chapter 16. 
 Emeril’s (Universal Orlando; % 407-224-2424). TV Chef Emeril
Lagasse’s original eatery at Universal’s CityWalk beckons with cre-
ative Creole dishes, an open-to-view “wine loft” with 12,000 bottles,
and a delightful atmosphere. See Chapter 17.
 Beech Street Grill (Jacksonville; % 904-277-3662). Housed in a his-
toric two-story home, this perennial award winner serves tasty,
upscale cuisine. See Chapter 21.
 Marker 32 (Jacksonville; % 904-223-1534). This Jacksonville
foodie hot spot features a million-dollar view of the Intracoastal as
well as a killer chipotle-rubbed beef tenderloin. See Chapter 21.
The Best Places for Fresh Seafood
 Joe’s Stone Crab (Miami’s South Beach; % 305-673-0365). This
South Beach institution wins the Great Crab War by serving the
most succulent stone crab in town (some say it’s a monopoly), pro-
viding an amusing see-scape of Miami’s movers, shakers, and most
curious — and crab-crazy — tourists. See Chapter 9. 
 Atlantic’s Edge (Islamorada; % 305-664-4651). This Keys standout
makes a mean Thai-spiced snapper, or you can bring your own
catch, and the staff will prepare it for you. See Chapter 11. 
Part I: Introducing Florida 
10

 Testa’s (Palm Beach; % 561-832-0992). The Palm Beach mainstay
continues its 75-year family tradition with seared tuna, almond-
crusted prawns, and an amazing seafood marinara. See Chapter 13.
 Ted Peters’ Famous Smoked Fish (St. Petersburg; % 727-381-7931).
Life doesn’t get much better than sipping a cold beer while diving
into red-oak-smoked mullet, mackerel, and more at this open-air St.
Petersburg institution. See Chapter 15.
 Blasé Café (Sarasota; % 941-349-9822). Don’t be fooled by the
name of this awesome local favorite. There’s nothing blasé about
Chef Todd’s fresh fish du jour. See Chapter 16.
The Best Romantic Hideaways
 Little Palm Island (Little Torch Key; % 800-343-8567). This sub-
lime resort, tucked away on a 5-acre isle near Little Torch Key, is
only accessible by boat. Kids under 16 are prohibited, and the
rooms don’t have phones, TVs, or alarm clocks. See Chapter 11. 
 Cheeca Lodge (Islamorada; % 800-327-2888) Cheeca, appropri-
ately pronounced chic-aahh, is a world-class resort with a laid-back
style that positively encourages the sharing of private moments.
See Chapter 11. 
 Marquesa Hotel (Key West; % 800-669-4631). The Marquesa
Hotel’s 40 rooms have the charm of a romantic bed-and-breakfast,
to go along with four-poster beds, marble baths, and private
porches. See Chapter 11. 
 Renaissance Vinoy Resort (St. Petersburg; % 800-468-3571). This
swank St. Pete stay has a pampering spa and an ambience straight
out of an F. Scott Fitzgerald novel. See Chapter 15.
 Don CeSar Beach Resort & Spa (St. Pete Beach; % 800-637-7200).
This sprawling pink structure is the epitome of a Gatsby-style man-
sion with a seafront setting. See Chapter 15. 
 Peabody Orlando (Orlando; % 800-732-2639). The Peabody
exudes a sophistication that ranges from its famous marching mal-
lards to candlelit dinners at its restaurant. See Chapter 17. 
 Casa Monica Hotel (St. Augustine; % 800-648-1888). Built in 1888,
the Casa Monica Hotel has the charm and Spanish architecture
common to the oldest city in the United States. See Chapter 21. 
The Best Family Attractions
 Miami MetroZoo (Miami; % 305-251-0400). The city’s only zoo
enthralls visitors of all ages thanks to a petting zoo and 700 critters,
including white tigers, black rhinos, and Komodo dragons. See
Chapter 10. 
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Florida 11

 Dolphin Research Center (Marathon; % 305-289-1121). The
Dolphin Research Center boasts the best of Florida’s swim-with-
the-dolphin programs. See Chapter 11. 
 Lion Country Safari (Loxahatchee; % 561-793-1084). This little
piece of Africa near West Palm Beach lets you drive through and
walk grounds that not only harbor lions but also elephants, rhinos,
and wildebeests. See Chapter 13. 
 Busch Gardens (Tampa; % 866-353-8622). Tampa’s biggest attrac-
tion offers close-up views of African animals as well as guided
tours, shows, flume and raft rides, and five roller coasters. See
Chapter 14. 
 Disney’s Magic Kingdom (Orlando; % 407-824-4321). This theme
park of all theme parks is an American classic. See Chapter 18. 
 Disney–MGM Studios (Orlando; % 407-824-4321). A large piece of
Hollywood comes to life in central Florida at the Disney–MGM
Studios. See Chapter 18.
 Universal Studios Florida (Orlando; % 800-711-0080). Less kitschy
than MGM, you can find lots of action and adventure at Universal
Studios. See Chapter 18.
 Islands of Adventure (Orlando; % 800-711-0080). Thrill rides and
cartoon faves make this Universal theme park one of Orlando’s
must-do’s. See Chapter 18.
 Kennedy Space Center (Cape Canaveral; % 321-449-4444). Blast
off with tons of fun centering on the past, present, and future of
space travel. See Chapter 19. 
 Daytona USA (Daytona Beach; % 386-947-6800). A state-of-the-art,
interactive vehicular attraction that’s even popular with non-race
fans, Daytona USA is one of the few places in the world where
speeding is a way of life. See Chapter 20.
The Best Chills and Thrills
 The roller coasters at Busch Gardens (Tampa; 866-353-8622). This
African-themed adventureland offers five whopping coasters. The
newest is Gwazi, a wooden coaster whose 50 mph thrills include
weightlessness. Kumba and Montu are 10 mph faster. The Python
offers a double corkscrew and a 70-foot plunge, while The Scorpion
has a 60-foot dive and a 360-degree loop. See Chapter 14.
 Summit Plummet at Disney’s Blizzard Beach starts slow but fin-
ishes with a 120-foot, wedgie-inducing freefall. You know that this
one must be good because there are viewing stands to watch the
suckers — er, riders — make the journey. See Chapter 18.
Part I: Introducing Florida 
12

 The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man at Islands of Adventure is
a 3-D simulator that dips and twists through comic-book action.
Watch out for the simulated, but very realistic feeling, 400-foot
drop. See Chapter 18.
 The Incredible Hulk Coaster at Islands of Adventure launches you
from 0 to 40 mph in two seconds and then does seven rollovers and
two deep drops — you’ll feel weightless, and possibly nauseated.
See Chapter 18.
 Dueling Dragons, also at Islands of Adventure, catapults frail
bodies on dueling coasters through five inversions at 55 to 60 mph,
and — get this — you come within 12 inches of the other coaster
on three occasions. See Chapter 18. 
 Rock ’n Roller Coaster at Disney–MGM Studios rips from 0 to 60
mph in 2.8 seconds and goes right into an inversion, as the 120
speakers in your stretch limo blast Aerosmith. And as if that isn’t
enough, all this takes place in semidarkness. See Chapter 18.
 The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror, also at Disney–MGM, is a free-
fall experience that leaves your stomach hanging at several levels —
Rod Serling would have loved it. See Chapter 18.
The Best Places to Get Tipsy
 Nikki Beach Club (South Beach; % 305-538-1111). This outdoor
oasis is a cross between the Playboy Mansion and an episode of
Survivor, with tiki huts, teepees, and, of course, bars, not to men-
tion a colorful array of scantily clad barflies. See Chapter 10.
 Alabama Jack’s (Islamorada; % 305-248-8741). Don’t drive too
fast or you’ll miss this converted gas station on the water that’s
home to delicious smoked fish and a colorful mix of Harley dudes,
old–school, Hee Haw–esque line dancers, and passers-by en route
to or from the Florida Keys. See Chapter 11. 
 Woody’s Saloon and Restaurant (Islamorada; % 305-664-4335).
This raunchy roadhouse bar features nightly headliners Big Dick
and the Extenders. The leader of the band is a frequently profound
and almost as frequently profane Native American who loves to
pick on his audience. See Chapter 11.
 Captain Tony’s (Key West; % 305-294-1838). Some believe that
this joint was the original Sloppy Joe’s frequented by Ernest
Hemingway. Undergarments left hanging from the ceiling pretty
much set the tone of this dive. See Chapter 11.
 Stan’s Idle Hour Seafood Restaurant (Goodland; % 941-394-3041).
This off-the-beaten-path bar-cum-restaurant has gained fame as the
home of some odd events, including the Goodland Mullet Festival,
the Buzzard Lope Queens, and Polish Octoberfest. See Chapter 16.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Florida 13

The Best Places to Party Until Dawn
 South Beach (Miami). South Beach, a.k.a. Glitter Beach, is just the
two southernmost miles of Miami Beach but feels much larger in
stature as an Art Deco District with clubs and bars featuring every-
thing from rock to rhumba. See Chapter 10. 
 Duval Street (Key West). The Bourbon Street of South Florida,
Duval Street is yet another great place to cruise the bars; also take
in the Sunset Celebration at nearby Mallory Square. See Chapter 11. 
 Las Olas Boulevard (Fort Lauderdale).What used to be a dirt road
leading to the Atlantic is now a tony street of cafes, galleries, bou-
tiques, and bars. See Chapter 13.
 Clematis Street (West Palm Beach). This downtown West Palm
Beach street offers lively action in pubs and clubs. See Chapter 13. 
 Ybor City. This Cuban enclave near Tampa really gets lively with
salsa-fied fun after the sun goes down. See Chapter 14. 
 Orlando. The crème de la crème of prefab clubs and bars, most
with a specific theme à la Planet Hollywood, Orlando is central
Florida’s mecca of entertainment. The city has two very themey
entertainment districts. Disney’s Pleasure Island and Universal’s
CityWalk let you party well into the wee hours. See Chapter 19.
The Best Places to Cast Your Reel
 The Keys. The Florida Keys are heaven for game fishermen (blue
and white marlin, bonefish, tarpon, and permit) as well as anglers
looking to put something on the dinner table. See Chapter 11. 
 Fort Lauderdale. Fort Lauderdale offers good launching points for
anglers looking for redfish, trout, snook, Spanish and king mack-
erel, sailfish, snapper, and grouper. See Chapter 13.
 Treasure Island. A good place to cast a line for grouper, amberjack,
sea bass, and snapper. See Chapter 15. 
 Boca Grande. The fishing off Boca Grande is wonderful, and things
really heat up in July when The World’s Richest Tarpon
Tournament is staged. See Chapter 16.

Deciding Where and 
When to Go
In This Chapter
 Knowing what to expect
 Greeting the seasons
 Wising up to weather warnings
 Checking out the calendar
F
lorida is a year-round destination — it has only a few rain dates —
but some places are best sampled in the so-called off season. Unless
you’re into togetherness, two of our most popular destinations are best
avoided during certain times of the year. Walt Disney World and Orlando’s
other major theme parks amount to instant insanity any time kids are
out of school, such as summer and holidays. The more popular Florida
beaches (Miami, Daytona, and St. Petersburg/Clearwater) also do a fever-
ish business in summer as well as during the annual snowbird season
(winter) and spring break.
I give you ammunition so you can decide when to go, but it’s quite likely
that personal factors will end up cementing your decision. Some of you,
for example, plan a vacation to avoid wicked weather back home. Others
take advantage of seasonal savings that are too good to pass up. And many
of you have to travel when the school calendar allows. The good news is
that there’s a season for everyone. 
Where you go depends on your interests and budget. Do you want to
soak in the sun? Avoid another human life-form for a while? Hook a tuna?
Explore the oldest city in the United States? Lose lunch on our best thrill
rides? This guide offers all these possibilities and more.
Diving Into Florida’s Regions
If you want to come to Florida but don’t know much about it, you’re in
good company. Even Florida natives are lucky if they get to know every-
thing about their own backyards.

This is a big state. Don’t even try to tackle it all at once. Biting off more
than a fraction of the state in one visit is futile. So I separate the state
into manageable chunks that you can study before deciding what you
want to cover this year (and perhaps, in the many years to come).
For starters, here are thumbnail sketches of the cities and regions to
get you thinking about a wish list. Do you want nightlife? Are the kids
making the decisions for you? Do you like the beach? Hate the forest?
Don’t be bashful. It doesn’t cost a thing to dream, and you’ll have time
later to whittle your list down to size. I give you all the tools necessary
to make the decision that’s right for you.
South Florida
The unofficial capital of the South Florida region, Miami is both pictur-
esque and sophisticated, with a pulsating nightlife. South Beach is
where La Dolce Vita fuses with La Vida Loca, known for hot clubs and
cool people watching along a beach that’s been described as America’s
Riviera. Villa Vizcaya and Coral Castle are two of the region’s finest
(and most ambitious) architectural marvels, while kitschier attractions
such as the Miami MetroZoo and Miami Seaquarium have been tickling
tourists for decades. The sports scene includes pro football, baseball,
basketball, and hockey franchises. But Miami is a moderately expensive
destination, and it has many of the other problems associated with a
metropolis, including crime, congestion, and pollution. (See Chapters 9
and 10 for details about Miami.)
Things thin and chill out a bit in the Keys, where the mood and the
magic are a little off-center, but that’s just the Conch Republic’s way of
life. Only a single road stretches over the 110 miles from the mainland to
Key West. This single highway can make the drive seem like an endless
journey when accidents close one or both lanes. The Keys are best for
those of you who want to kick back and forget about following a sched-
ule or a dress code. Water sports rule through most of the Keys, espe-
cially at such gems as Bahia Honda State Recreation Area on Big Pine
Key and John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park in Key Largo. Key West
was a favorite stomping ground (and watering hole) for several of the
most notable literary and artistic figures of the 20th century. Its attrac-
tions include the Audubon House and the Ernest Hemingway Home
and Museum (see Chapter 11).
South Florida is also the gateway to Florida’s greatest natural treasure,
the Everglades (see Chapter 12). And Palm Beach is the winter home of
some of America’s rich and famous. To match the size of his ego, Donald
Trump bought Mar a Lago, Palm Beach’s largest and most resplendent
home. Even if you’re not on Forbes’ list of the richest people in the world,
it’s fun to window shop along Worth Avenue, known as the Rodeo Drive
of the South (see Chapter 13).
Part I: Introducing Florida 
18

Fort Lauderdale has several of Florida’s best golf courses, and the bur-
geoning yet historic downtown riverfront area, with shops, dining, and
assorted amusements, is one of the region’s most popular new tourist
draws. 
The Gulf Coast
With some exceptions, this coast hasn’t experienced the explosive growth
that the Atlantic side has. The water is part of the reason. The Atlantic
is alive with crashing waves, which is as good as the surf gets in Florida.
Across the way, the Gulf of Mexico is calm and tepid, like a soothing tub. 
Tampa’s Latin influence adds a welcome touch to the region’s food, cul-
ture, and architecture. The city has a moderately good arts calendar, a
dandy nightclub scene in the Cuban enclave of Ybor City, and in Busch
Gardens, a theme park that rivals Orlando’s offerings. St. Petersburg’s
signature attractions include its Gulf Beaches, the Salvador Dalí Museum,
and the Florida International Museum.
The two cities have a top-rated sports calendar that includes big-league
baseball, football, and hockey teams. But tourism is an afterthought on
Tampa’s side of the bay, and St. Petersburg is nearly as overbuilt as Miami.
(See Chapters 14 and 15 for more on Tampa and St. Petersburg.)
Sarasota’s Asolo Theatre and the Ringling Museum of Art give the 
cultural community plenty of reason to crow. Gulf-view towns, such
as Naples, Marco Island, and Fort Myers, are quieter than most of
Florida’s other beachfront cities. This stretch of the coast has more than
10,000 islands including Sanibel, Captiva, Gasparilla, and Boca Grande.
On the downside, this area is spread far and wide. There are few day-
filling activities, and you have to drive a while to get to your next stop.
(See Chapter 16 for information on Sarasota, Naples, and Fort Myers.)
Central Florida
If Orlando were a rock group, it would be called “Mickey and the
Wannabes.” In Central Florida, Walt Disney World is the lead vocalist,
Universal Orlando and SeaWorld play the guitar and keyboards, and
dozens of smaller attractions are behind the drums. This area truly is
fantasyland, but the crowds, cost, and confusion can turn your trip into
a frightful experience.
As late as 1970, Orlando was a small town dotted with cow patties, orange
blossoms, and palmetto stands. A year later, Disney changed that forever.
Uncle Walt’s legacy spawned four theme parks (Magic Kingdom, Epcot,
Disney–MGM Studios, and Animal Kingdom) and nearly a dozen minor
attractions, plus a supporting cast of resorts, restaurants, and stores —
Chapter 2: Deciding Where and When to Go 19

enough to be its own city. Orlando is also home to the ever-expanding
world of Universal Orlando (Universal Studios Florida, Islands of
Adventure, and more) as well as SeaWorld and its younger sister,
Discovery Cove. (Check out Chapter 18 for information on all the
Disney, Universal, and SeaWorld attractions.)
If ever there were a destination that virtually had it all, Orlando is it,
which is why many people love it. It’s a reasonably convenient place to
park yourself — much of the hoopla is in two areas, Lake Buena Vista
and International Drive, and most of its neighborhoods have just about
everything you need for an amusing vacation.
On the flip side, traffic and crowds can be brutal, and the theme
parks are expensive. (Most visits cost a family of four $180 — just
for admission.)
The Great North
Daytona Beach’s calling cards are bikinis, bikers, and bullet cars. The city
bills itself as “the world’s most famous beach.” The title is disputable, but
Daytona is a wide stretch of white sand, bathed in frothy Atlantic waters.
Aside from the beach, Daytona’s most popular tourist attractions are the
Daytona International Speedway and Daytona USA, a high-tech, inter-
active, jump-and-shout exhibit in front of the speedway (see Chapter 20).
But if you’re not into sun, sand, and speed, Daytona may feel like you
woke up in Wayne’s World with a Southern twang. And if you arrive in
March and aren’t a member of the spring-break squad, you’re likely to
feel out of place on the beach.
The oldest city in the United States, St. Augustine (founded in 1565), is
located a little farther north of Daytona on the Atlantic coast. If the idea
of forts and other musty mysteries appeals to you, here’s a chance to
go back to the days of the earliest colonization. Castillo de San Marcos
is a precious link to the past as are several storefronts that stake a
claim to being the oldest something or other (jail, school, and so on).
Although the city has its share of tourist trappings (a pseudo Fountain
of Youth, for example), it also has some nifty places to visit, such as the
St. Augustine Alligator Farm and Zoological Park and the Bridge of
Lions (see Chapter 21).
Continuing north, Jacksonville is a Navy town that has traded paper
mills for sprawl and interstate clutter. The Jacksonville Zoo and the 
natural beaches, such as the one at Little Talbot Island State Park,
are pluses, but most tourists find themselves having to scatter to find
things to do in the Jacksonville area. One of northeast Florida’s nicer
resorts, Amelia Island Plantation, is 30 miles north. This resort blends
environmental consciousness with top-flight golf, tennis, and beach
activities. At the other end of the island, Fort Clinch State Park, near
Fernandina Beach, offers living-history presentations that are a joy to
see (see Chapter 21).

Revealing the Secret of the Seasons
Seasons? You bet Florida has them.
Of course, some of them are far less pronounced than in places like
Europe, Canada, and New York. Sometimes it’s hard to even tell if
Florida has an autumn or spring. Summer’s heat and humidity often last
six months or more. During hurricane season, which lasts from June
through November, intense storms can send even the most diehard
Floridians running for shelter (see the “Heeding Weather Warnings” sec-
tion, later in this chapter). As a tradeoff, winters are generally mild and
pleasant. Florida skies are unusually sunny, except for the first day of
winter cold fronts, a short spring rainy season, and the daily thunder-
storms that come and go quickly in summer. Temperatures in Florida
are more moderate along the coasts, particularly on the Atlantic side,
which has a decent sea breeze; the center of the state tends to be a bit
colder in winter and hot as blazes in summer.
Most people enjoy their vacations more when crowds are thin and the
weather is mild — spring and fall in Florida. Except in Orlando, rooms
and (in some cases) other expenses are cheaper during these seasons.
If you have youngsters, think about pulling them out of school for a few
days during the off season to avoid crowds and lines at theme parks and
other attractions. Ask their teachers for schoolwork to take with you.
You can also suggest that your kids write a report on some educational
element of the vacation. If you’re a senior who can travel when you please,
think about avoiding the peak of the winter snowbird season as well as
the summer and holiday family times.
Here’s our seasonal score sheet.
Discovering springtime in Florida
Spring is a popular vacation time for most travelers, and Florida is no dif-
ferent. Here are some of the best reasons to go to Florida in the springtime:
 The weather is mild.
 Spring is when Florida really blooms. Think flower power.
 Accommodations that give discounts give them now.
However, keep in mind the following springtime pitfalls:
 Without a winter, a long spring is rare. Temps can get warm and
sticky in April (heat + humidity = Hades).
 The pollen drives hay-fever sufferers crazy.
 Spring break cometh. Avoid it unless you’re a breaker.
Chapter 2: Deciding Where and When to Go 21

Heating up the scene in summer
Florida bustles during the summer season, in spite of the sizzling tem-
peratures. Here are some points to consider:
 Wow — picturesque 6 a.m. sunrises and 9 p.m. sunsets.
 August means back-to-school sales at malls and outlets.
 Air-conditioning is alive and well. Savvy travelers spend the
middle of the day indoors, whether it’s in a cool attraction or
their accommodations.
But, again, keep in mind the following:
 The heat and humidity are oppressive.
 Summer thunderstorms cool things off a little, but they pass
quickly, allowing the sun to turn concrete and asphalt walks
into frying pans. Summer is also the heart of hurricane season
(see the “Heeding Weather Warnings” section, later in this chapter).
 Discounts? Ha! Why cut prices with these crowds?
Falling into the tropics
Fall is a beautiful time of year to visit Florida. Here are some of the
state’s autumn bonuses:
 Ah, fall foliage. Florida has the same fiery reds, brilliant oranges,
and screaming yellows as New England. The difference is that ours
last about 17 minutes.
 Accommodations that give discounts do so in the fall, too.
 Lines and crowds begin to shrink.
Some things to look out for, however:
 It’s cooler, but temps aren’t as mild as those in spring until
Thanksgiving or later.
 The hurricane season lasts through November, and storm activity
can run high in September and October (see the “Heeding Weather
Warnings” section, later in this chapter).
Heading south for the winter
Winter brings visions of softly falling snowflakes (and slick roads and
salt trucks) to most travelers, but that’s not the case in Florida. You
should consider the following pluses when planning a winter vacation
in Florida:
Part I: Introducing Florida 
22

 There isn’t a true winter, just a few days at or near freezing, followed
by mild, sunny weather. So leave those winter blues back home.
 Lines are short in many tourist areas during most of the winter
season.
Winter does have its downside, however. Consider the following:
 The mid-December to early January holidays are nearly as crowded
as the dead of summer.
 Forget about a white Christmas. It’s common for temperatures to
be in the 90s during Hanukkah, Christmas, and Kwanzaa.
 After mid-December arrives, prices rise.
Wising Up about the Weather
You can check out Table 2-1 for the average 24-hour temperatures for
selected Florida cities. Beyond these averages and the seasonal informa-
tion I provide in this chapter, there’s no way to get a true-blue, long-term
forecast. But you can find short-term forecasts (presuming you trust
meteorologists) at the following venues:
 The Weather Channel: The 24-hour cable channel features Florida
on a regular basis, and it offers ongoing coverage when big weather
news happens. You can also get information on the Internet at www.
weather.com.
 The Weather Center: This Tampa-based service is a good source for
statewide weather information. The Weather Center (www.weather
center.com) features data on tides, rainfall, temperatures, and
severe weather warnings as well as a link to the National Weather
Service (NWS). Speaking of the NWS, you can jump to its site at
www.nws.noaa.gov for more information.

Heeding Weather Warnings
There’s no need for paranoia, but knowing a little about Florida’s climatic
temper tantrums can reduce the odds of one or all of them ruining your
vacation.
Making hurricane waves
Should you worry about hurricanes? No, but it helps to be aware of
them. The hurricane season runs from June 1 through November 30.
In an average year, 12 or so tropical storms are born somewhere in the
Gulf and Atlantic waters, half or more develop into hurricanes, and,
again on average, 1 or 2 may touch part of Florida, especially coastal
areas. The hurricane season was particularly brutal in 2004 with four
hurricanes — Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne — hitting Florida in a
period of six weeks. 
If you’re unlucky enough to be here when a hurricane is threatening,
modern tracking gives you plenty of warning. In severe cases, your
hotels may be evacuated and you may end up in a shelter. At that point,
there’s really nothing more you can do but wait out the storm in safety.
If the thought of a hurricane really bothers you, consider steering clear
of Florida in the most active months, which are usually July to mid-
October, the same months that Florida is hottest and most crowded.
If one week before your much-anticipated vacation Hurricane Harry plows
right through your destination, how can you tell if Miami’s Fontainebleau
Hilton Resort is still standing? You could ask a reservationist or some-
one at the local chamber of commerce. But if you’re a Doubting Danielle,
you may want to turn to a third party. The state Division of Emergency
Management in Tallahassee (% 850-413-9900) is the agency in charge of
putting Florida back together again. You should get a fair, impartial report
on damage to specific areas. You can also find information on the agency’s
Web site at www.dca.state.fl.us/fdem.

Tumbling tornadoes
Tornadoes are fairly uncommon, but they and waterspouts are a fringe
benefit of summer thunderstorms. You’re more likely to run into one at
Universal Studios’ “Twister” attraction, but don’t take any chances. When
tornado warnings are issued, go indoors and stay clear of windows. April,
May, and June are considered peak periods — though some nasty ones
have dropped into the Florida Panhandle (a region not covered in this book
so I can cover more popular areas more thoroughly) in February and March.
Don’t take lightning lightly. Here are a few quick facts:
 Lightning is 50,000°F, five times hotter than the sun.
 Lightning can reach out from the sky and zap you from 10 miles away.
 Lightning travels fast — a radar gun clocked its speed at
186,000 miles per second.
But you have to be pretty unlucky to be standing in the wrong place
(under an oak tree, wading in water, or trying to hit a golf ball while
wearing metal cleats and holding a metal club) at the wrong time
(again, usually during a thunderstorm). Lightning will more than likely
entertain you: The pyrotechnics really light up the sky. But keep your
distance. The fireworks are better and safer at Walt Disney World.
Much of central Florida is considered the Lightning Capital of the United
States. Tampa and St. Petersburg are among the most common targets,
with 88 days of lightning activity and some 50 strikes per square mile a
year. An average house in this part of the universe gets hit every 20 or
30 years. If you were as big as a house and never moved, well, then that
gives you an idea of the likelihood of a run-in with lightning.
Forgoing some sun
Floridians are as proud of that big orange thing in the sky as Bubba is of his
prize pickup truck. We even nicknamed ourselves the Sunshine State. The
sun certainly is a friend of Florida tourism, but it isn’t always a friend of
Florida tourists, especially the ones who arrive unprepared for its sucker
punches. One of these blows from the sun, sunburn, is a bad hombre, but
its evil twin, sun poisoning, can ruin your vacation. Most burns can be
eased with over-the-counter creams or aloe. But sun poisoning — sunburn
to the fourth or fifth power — is far more dangerous. It can result in fever,
chills, headaches, dizziness, nausea, and in the worst cases, sunstroke.
Protecting yourself from sunburn and sunstroke is simple. Lather your
skin with a sunblock that has an SPF (sun protection factor) rating of 30 or
higher. (Do not use tanning oil. That’s like slathering yourself with bacon
grease before jumping into a low-burning skillet.) You may think the ulti-
mate souvenir is a Florida tan, but tans aren’t all they’re cracked up to be.
Ask any native the state’s skin cancer rates. If nothing worse happens,
your Florida tan will start to peel by the time you get back on the block.
Chapter 2: Deciding Where and When to Go 25

If you skip this prevention advice and go straight to the I’m-on-fire-and-I-
feel-a-bit-woozy phase, helping hands are on standby at Poison Control
(% 800-282-3171).
Remember to bring a wide-brimmed hat and don’t forget a native’s
favorite fashion statement — sunglasses.
Raining down
Rain doesn’t hurt anyone, but it can dampen a beach vacation and out-
door activities. Much of the Atlantic coast in Miami-Dade, Broward, and
Palm Beach counties gets 60 or more inches of rain a year, 7 more inches
than the state average. The Keys get about 40 inches. Summers bring brief
but daily rains to much of the state. You can often wait out a rainstorm if
some shelter is nearby; don’t automatically pack up for the day unless it
looks like there’s no end in sight.
Checking Out Florida’s Calendar of Events
Florida packs the schedule with dozens of exciting festivals and special
events throughout the year. In the following sections, I list some highlights.
Keep in mind that although many of Florida’s events are fun-filled, some
are especially rowdy and crowded. Here are a few of the more notorious:
 Gasparilla Pirate Fest (Tampa): On the last Saturday in January,
hundreds of boats and hundreds of thousands of revelers fill the
bay and downtown Tampa for Gasparilla, a festival capped by a
pirate invasion. A barge masquerading as a ship, mostly filled with
city bigwigs, invades and captures Tampa on behalf of the mythical
pirate, Jose Gaspar. Most of the bigwigs have 80-proof blood when
this happens (even though it’s 10 a.m.). In all, there are two weeks
of events, including foot races, street parties, and parades. It’s a
smaller version of Mardi Gras, but one that should be experienced
in limited doses, if at all. If you want a dose, call % 813-251-4500 or
go to www.gasparillapiratefest.com.
 Bike Week (Daytona Beach): The Sturgis of the South, Daytona
Beach’s Bike Week events, which take place sometime between
February and mid-March, are to be avoided at all costs unless you
like motorcycles and bikers in all sizes, shapes, and states of con-
sciousness. Daytona doesn’t exaggerate when it says more than
500,000 two-wheel enthusiasts show up for the events, which include
parades, races, shows, entertainment, and a fair share of falling down
on the beach. If you’re a glutton for noise and crowds, call % 800-
854-1234 (U.S. only) or 386-255-0981 or go to www.bikeweek.com.
 Spring Break: Arrggghhhh!!! Spring break, spanning March and
April, brings an annual invasion of partying college kids to beach
hot spots including Panama City, Daytona, Key West, and Miami.
Orlando gets its share of mayhem, too.

 Fantasy Fest (Key West): Fantasy Fest, in which Mardi Gras goes
south the last week in October, sees Key West overtaken by wildly
costumed (and some wildly undercostumed) revelers who have no
shame and no parental guidance. This weeklong, hedonistic, X-rated
Halloween party is not for children. If you’re going, make reservations
early because hotels tend to book up very quickly for this event.
Call % 305-296-1817 or go to www.fantasyfest.net.
 Biketoberfest (Daytona Beach): If Bike Week tickles your fancy, the
Daytona Beach Biketoberfest blowout probably will, too. Races,
touring rides, parades, costumed bikers, and other activities —
such as biker tipping — fill the final weeks of October. Give them a
loud shout at % 800-854-1234 (U.S. only) or 386-255-0415 or check
them out online at www.biketoberfest.org.
 Guavaween (Tampa): At the risk of sounding like we’re picking on
Daytona and Tampa, the Guavaween festival held in Tampa’s Ybor
City is a Latin-style Halloween celebration that has become seedier
over the years. Still, you may be curious enough to call % 813-248-
3712 or 813-621-7121 or refer to their Web site (www.guavaween.net)
to get more information.

week in January.
February
Dusty midways, hopeless games, and greasy food join hands with live-
stock exhibits, arts and crafts, and big-name country entertainers at the
Florida State Fair (% 813-621-7821; www.floridastatefair.com), a
fair held on the east side of Tampa. Second and third week of February.
Megayachts, dinghies, and everything in between are featured at

March–April
If you need proof that Miami’s predominantly Hispanic community
knows how to throw a party, head for the Carnaval Miami/Calle Ocho
(% 305-644-8888; www.carnavalmiami.com). The largest of its kind in
the country, the nine-day ethnic celebration comes to a pounding finale
with the 23-block Calle Ocho street festival. Early March.
Cypress Gardens comes alive with hundreds of annual blossoms at Spring
Flower Festival, featuring more than two dozen real-life figures decked

industry and features live music, entertainment, and slews of fisher-folk
dressed up as pirates. The first weekend in May.
At McDonald’s Air and Sea Show (% 954-467-3555; www.national
salute.com), it’s a tough call as far as what’s more crowded — Fort

2 million onlookers craning their necks for a view of big-name air wolves
such as the Blue Angels and the Thunderbirds. Early May. 
Key Largo hosts the largest fishing tournament in the Keys, the Coconuts

Gay Disney (www.gayday.com or www.gaydays.com), draws tens of thou-
sands of gay and lesbian travelers to Central Florida. This event grew out
of Gay Day, an unofficial event at Disney World dating to the early 1990s,
when it drew 50,000 people. Universal and SeaWorld also roll out the red
carpet for gays and lesbians over this weekend. First weekend in June.
Not to be outdone by Carnaval Miami/Calle Ocho, the Coconut Grove

tickets ($30 per night or $50 for the pair) early. Contact Disney for dates.
October
The month-long Destin Fishing Rodeo (% 850-837-6734; www.destin
fishingrodeo.org), is held in an area that’s billed as the “World’s

anglers. The entire month of October.
Chapter 2: Deciding Where and When to Go 29

Come to the Epcot International Food and Wine Festival (% 407-824-
4321; www.disneyworld.com) if you’d like to sip and savor the food
and beverages of several cultures. In addition, more than 60 wineries

charged for this event, where liquor flows freely. Nineteen fright-filled
evenings in late October.
November
For its annual Chrysanthemum Festival (% 800-282-2123; www.

Mid-November.
Bibliophiles, literati, and some of the world’s most prestigious and pro-
lific authors descend upon downtown Miami for the Miami Bookfair
International (% 305-237-3258). The weekend street fair is the most
well-attended of the entire event, in which regular folk mix with word-
smiths such as Tom Wolfe and Jane Smiley, while indulging in snacks,
antiquarian books, and literary gossip. All lectures are free, but they
fill up quickly, so get there early. One week in mid-November.
The Walt Disney World Festival of the Masters (% 407-824-4321; www.

People who complain that the holiday season just isn’t as festive in Fort
Lauderdale as it is in colder parts of the world probably have missed the
spectacular Winterfest Boat Parade (% 954-767-0686), held along the
Intracoastal Waterways. Forget decking the halls. At this parade, the decks
are decked out in magnificent holiday regalia as they gracefully — and
boastfully — glide up and down the water. If you’re not on a boat, the
best views are from waterfront restaurants or anywhere you can squeeze
in along the water. Mid-December.
During the Disney Christmas festivities (% 407-824-4321; www.disney
world.com), Main Street in the Magic Kingdom is lavishly decked out
with lights and holly, and carolers greet visitors. Thousands of colored
lights illuminate an 80-foot tree. Epcot, Disney–MGM Studios, and Animal
Kingdom also offer special embellishments and entertainment throughout
the holiday season, as do all Disney resorts. Contact Disney for dates.
Amelia Island, located between Jacksonville and Fernandina Beach, puts
on a month-long Victorian Seaside Christmas celebration that includes
tours of bed-and-breakfasts, teddy bear teas, and sleigh rides on the
beach (% 800-226-3542 [U.S. only] or 904-277-0717; www.amelianow.com).

Planning Your Trip 
to Florida

In this part . . .
O
kay, it’s time to slide into some serious planning. I open
this part of the book by talking about money matters,
such as whether to use traveler’s checks or credit cards, and
by providing you with information that guides you through
planning a budget for your trip. Then I discuss getting to and
around Florida and suggest ways for zeroing in on a room
that’s right for you. Finally, I consider the pros and cons of
travel and medical insurance, and offer up some specialized
resources for travelers with unique travel needs or interests.
So, if you’re ready, sing a little traveling music with me!

D
eveloping a realistic budget is an important key to enjoying your
vacation. The last thing you want to experience when you get to
Florida is sticker shock — and the state has been known to exact a pound
of flesh from even the most cost-conscious travelers. From hotel rooms
to restaurant tabs to admission fees, you can ring up a high tally if you
don’t do your homework in advance. The good news is that I can help
you make sure that you don’t bust your bankroll.
Planning Your Budget
Budgeting a Florida vacation is easy. The hard part is sticking to the
budget. Sometimes tourist attractions, souvenir stands, beaches, 
and 80-proof fun make people so giddy that they get separated from
both their common sense and their finances. They end up in shock —
especially when credit card bills begin arriving in the mail. But if you
avoid too much impulse bingeing — er, buying — and draft an honest
budget, you’re home free.
Make sure to include everything in your vacation budget. Add in the cost
of getting to the airport; airport parking (if you drive yourself); airline
tickets (you can find tips for getting the best airfare in Chapter 4; trans-
portation from your destination airport to your hotel, or the rental-car
charge if you’re driving yourself; the room rate; meals; admissions to
attractions (multiplied by the number of days you’ll visit them); sight-
seeing tours; souvenirs; and entertainment expenses. Then tack on
another 15 percent to 20 percent as a safety net.

Later in this chapter, I offer you a few ways to beat the high cost of Florida
travel. (Also, check out the destination chapters for more money-saving
travel tips.) But first, here are some things to expect in the way of prices
when you get to Florida.
Transportation
If you’re going to stay put in some of Florida’s big cities, you can get
by without a rental car. You can get around Orlando (see Chapter 19),
and to a lesser degree, Fort Lauderdale (see Chapter 13), St. Petersburg
(see Chapter 15), and Daytona Beach (see Chapter 20) by hotel or pri-
vate shuttles and tour services, especially if you pick a room that’s near
the places you want to visit. You can also get by without a car in Miami
Beach, St. Augustine, and Key West because most of their hot spots are
concentrated in reasonably small areas.
That said, you’ll be at the mercy of the aforementioned services, you
may waste a good deal of time getting around using public and private
transportation, and in some cities (Miami for one), relying on taxis will
cost you a bundle. If you don’t want the hassle or you’re visiting a smaller
destination, rentals are advisable, if not a necessity. Their rates start
at about $35 a day or $110 a week. Don’t forget to add in any hotel and
attraction parking fees, noted in the destination chapters, as well as the
20 percent state taxes assessed on rental cars in Florida.
Lodging
Florida is a big state that wears several different faces, so don’t pay
attention to hotel price information that mentions a statewide average —
it really doesn’t exist here. A $50-a-night room in Crystal River (see
Chapter 15) may be a little above average, while a similarly priced room
in Miami will put you in a neighborhood where you definitely don’t want
to be. Due to these differences in rates, I give you a range in the destina-
tion chapters that goes from low to high like this: $99 or less, inexpensive;
$100 to $199, moderate; $200 to $249, expensive; and $250 and higher,
very expensive. If you insist on an average (don’t hold me to it) room
rate, you should expect to spend
 $30 to $60 in towns that are off the beaten path.
 $70 to $100 in the mid-Atlantic coastal region, north of Palm Beach
and south of Cocoa Beach/Titusville, and on the Gulf Coast, north
of the St. Petersburg/Tampa area and south of Sarasota (excluding
Naples).
 $100 to $150 for the mainstream hotels in Miami and Orlando; the
beaches of Daytona, Fort Lauderdale, and Naples; and the corporate
zones in Tampa and Fort Lauderdale.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Florida 
36

 $150 to $250 for the expensive (but not top-notch) accommoda-
tions around Key West, Miami, Orlando, and Palm Beach; the state’s
golf and spa resorts; and the upper-end corporate and business
zones in Fort Lauderdale, Jacksonville, Miami, Orlando, Tampa,
and so on.
 $250 and into the ionosphere at the high-end resorts and corporate
retreats found in Miami, Naples/Marco Island, Orlando, Palm Beach,
and the Jacksonville area.
Dining
In most Florida cities, you can buy three squares for about $35 per person,
per day (excluding tax, tip, and the 80-proof fun I mentioned a little earlier).
You won’t eat at gourmet restaurants for that amount, but you won’t be
condemned to Uncle Mel’s No-Frills Grille, either. Allowing for $35 per
person per day gets you into B to C+ eateries. Major tourist cities, such as
Miami and Orlando, as well as business destinations, such as Jacksonville
and Tampa, are a pinch pricier for the same class of cuisine. And if you
doom yourself to the theme parks, expect to pay 20 percent more for the
same or lesser quality food.
I promise to give you four price levels in the dining areas of the destination
chapters — $14 and under, $15 to $24, $25 to $39, and $40 and up —
although I cater more to people on moderate budgets.
Sightseeing
When it comes to a day’s entertainment, the amount you spend depends
on what city you visit and what attractions and activities interest you
the most. Orlando will unquestionably cost you more than any other
Florida city. SeaWorld’s sister park, Discovery Cove (see Chapter 18)
has raised the bar on Florida attraction prices. Tickets are $229 from
January 1to March 21 and September 1 to December 31; and $249 from
March 22 to August 31 for a daylong adventure that includes a 30-minute
swim with the dolphins, seven days’ admission to SeaWorld, lunch, and
a few other wet-and-wild goodies. (It’s $129–$179 depending on season,
if you can skip the dolphin swim.)
Orlando’s theme parks are part of the next tier. Single-day passes cost
$55 for adults and $44 for kids 3 to 9 years old at Disney’s four parks.
Universal’s two theme parks cost $55 for adults and $45 for kids 3 to 9,
and the SeaWorld admission is $54 for adults and $45 for kids 3 to 9.
Those prices do not include 6 percent sales tax. If you’re going to be a
regular, buy one of the multiday, multipark passes outlined in Chapter 18.
Busch Gardens in Tampa (see Chapter 14) also falls in this tier.
Chapter 3: Managing Your Money 37

The fees for Florida’s other attractions range downward from those that
you would pay at theme parks to free or next to nothing for an endless
string of museums. Table 3-1 has a cross section.

Shopping
You won’t find many bargains here. You also won’t find much that’s
patently Florida, except citrus, overpriced seashells, stuffed Mickeys,
and T-shirts from tourist-courting bars. Our best advice: Avoid the shops
in the vacation zones. If you must buy, scout local newspapers for ads
aimed at the townies and shop where they do. Also, be wary of the so-
called factory outlets that promise deep discounts. Most of them don’t
deliver. (Know suggested retail prices before you walk in the door.)
Being an international city, Miami features the most diverse shopping
in the state.
Florida has many of the same retailers found in other U.S. states: Macy’s,
Bloomingdale’s, Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, Sears, Saks, Burdines,
and Dillard’s. Their sales will probably appeal to travelers coming from
another country, but Americans can find the same prices at home. Ditto
for the discount chains, such as Kmart, Target, Wal-Mart, computer sell-
ers, such as CompUSA, and electronics marts, including Circuit City and
Radio Shack.
Nightlife
Here’s a good guideline when it comes to Florida nightlife: If a destination
has a beach, it has a bar that hops from midmorning into the wee hours.
Miami, specifically South Beach, arguably has the hottest nightclub
scene, thanks to its Latin culture, 5 a.m. liquor licenses, and an infusion
of celebrities who don’t come out before midnight. Disney’s Pleasure
Island and Universal’s CityWalk have given Orlando reason to shine after
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Florida 
38

dark. (Table 3-2 lists examples of expenses you’re likely to encounter
during an Orlando stay.) To a smaller degree, that’s also the case in
Ybor City near Tampa, where the music also has Latin spice.
Most bars are free. Cover charges in clubs generally run from nothing to
$20, depending on the city; Miami and Orlando clubs usually have the
highest covers in the state. The most expensive clubs are located in the
hot spots mentioned, where drinks tend to be pricey ($7 and up), so try
to hit during happy-hour bargains. Clubbing — assuming that you can
find a club in some of the quieter spots — usually costs much less in the
smaller cities. (Table 3-3 lists sample expenses you may encounter in
Miami.)

Keeping a Lid on Hidden Expenses
Be on the lookout for these not-so-nice surprises:
 Sales tax: Florida adds a 6 percent sales tax to most items, except
groceries and medical services. Additionally, some communities
have a local-option sales tax and a bed tax on hotel rooms that can
push the total tax to 12 percent or more on a room. So ask when
booking.
 Rental-car charges: Sales tax, surcharges, and various other required
add-ons could add 20 percent to 25 percent to the rates that rental-
car companies quote you. Ask about add-ons when you book.
 Phoning home: If ever there were a travel commandment that
should not be broken, this is it: Thou shalt not make a telephone
call from thy hotel room without first asking how much it will cost.
Although some hotels don’t charge for local calls, most do. And
the charge for a long-distance call can be marked up by as much as
200 percent. Some hotels charge you even if you use your calling
card or dial a toll-free number. Save yourself a coronary and ask
before you dial, or better yet, use pay phones — almost all hotels
have them in their lobbies.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Florida 
40

 Minibar charges: Sure those peanuts are convenient, but are they
worth the price of your kids’ college tuition? Even looking isn’t free;
many of the minibars at better hotels have a built-in sensor system
that charges you 15 seconds after you lift an item.
 Tipping: Don’t forget to budget for tips! Gratuities generally run
15 percent for restaurant service and cab rides. (In the case of
restaurants, double-check the bill before you tip. Some restaurants
automatically add a gratuity to the check.) Housekeepers at your
hotel may be worth $1 to $2 a day if you feel they should be rewarded
for cleaning your messy mess or honoring your “do not disturb”
until late in the day. Baggage handlers usually get $1 per bag.
 Park food: As I mentioned earlier, if you spend time at the major
theme parks and some smaller attractions, such as the Kennedy
Space Center or Parrot Jungle, you may be stuck paying high prices
for low- to middling-quality food.
Cutting Costs — but Not the Fun
Considering the warnings I’ve already dished out, by now you must be
wondering whether you can afford this place. Of course you can. It’s
simply a matter of choosing a vacation that fits your budget. Florida isn’t
as pricey as some folks think. Sure, the prices at five-star crash pads will
steal your breath, but the millions of tourists who arrive every year have
created considerable competition, and that can result in bargains.
After you’ve settled on your accommodations and airfare, you can keep
the other expenses in check by regulating what attractions you see, where
you eat, and how much time you spend doing the free stuff or things that
are included in your room rate. (A day at the motel pool is cheaper than
taking a family of four deep-sea fishing in Destin or visiting one of the
costly theme parks.) You can find plenty of ways to cut costs, including
the following:
 Go in the off season. During nonpeak times — October and
November, April and May, and the two weeks before Christmas —
you’ll find that the airlines and hotels slash their prices by as much
as 40 percent. These are the best times of year to travel, if you’re
trying to save money (and avoid crowds).
 Buy a package tour. For many destinations, one call to a travel agent
or packager can net you airfare, hotel reservations, a car, and some
attractions tickets, all for much less than if you tried to put the trip
together yourself. Even if you don’t want to go with a complete
package — say, if you want to buy your airfare with frequent-flier
miles or you just don’t like what a full package offers — you can
book room/car deals or other special packages directly through
some hotels. (See Chapter 4 for more information in package tours.)
Chapter 3: Managing Your Money 41

 Always ask about discounts. Membership in AAA, frequent-flier
plans, trade unions, AARP, the military, your company, or other
groups may qualify you for discounted rates on plane tickets, hotel
rooms, car rentals, and even meals. Many attractions also offer dis-
counts to members of certain organizations. Ask about everything
— you could end up pleasantly surprised.
 Reserve a room with a refrigerator and coffeemaker. You don’t
have to slave over a hot stove to cut a few costs; several motels
have minifridges and coffeemakers. Buying supplies for breakfast
will save you money — and probably calories. Also remember that
room service is among the costliest ways to eat, and the food qual-
ity often rivals cardboard.
 Skip the room with a view. Rooms with great views are the most
expensive accommodations in any hotel. Because you probably
won’t be hanging out in your room all day anyway, why pay the
price? (See Chapter 6 for more about room rates and views.)
 Ask if your kids can stay in your room with you. A room with two
double beds usually doesn’t cost any more than one with a queen-
size bed, and many hotels won’t charge the additional-person rate
for children. Even if you have to pay $10 or $15 for a rollaway bed,
you’ll save a ton by not taking two rooms.
 Don’t rent a gas guzzler. Renting a smaller car is cheaper, and you
save on gas to boot. Unless you’re traveling with kids and need lots
of space, don’t go beyond the economy size. For more on car rentals,
see Chapter 5.
 Pick up those free, coupon-packed visitor magazines. Detailed
maps, feature stories, dining and shopping directories, and dis-
count coupons give these pocket-size giveaways a good wallop.
Look for them in your hometown Sunday newspaper or, after you
land, in the lobbies of hotels or restaurants.
 Skip souvenirs. Make your photographs and memories the best
mementos of your trip. If you’re worried about money, do without
the T-shirts, seashells, key chains, salt-and-pepper shakers, mouse
ears, and other trinkets. Set a spending limit and stick to it!
Handling Money 
You’re the best judge of how much cash you feel comfortable carrying
or what alternative form of currency is your favorite. That’s not going to
change much on your vacation. True, you’ll probably be moving around
more and incurring more expenses than you generally do (unless you
happen to eat out every meal when you’re at home), and you may let
your mind slip into vacation gear and not be as vigilant about your safety
as when you’re in work mode. But, those factors aside, the only type of
payment that won’t be quite as available to you away from home is your
personal checkbook.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Florida 
42

Using ATMs and carrying cash
The easiest and best way to get cash away from home is from an ATM
(automated teller machine). Florida has an ample supply of 24-hour
ATMs. You can find the machines at most malls, banks, and convenience
stores, such as 7-Eleven and Circle K. Frequently, one or more ATMs are
located inside theme parks and larger tourist attractions as well as in
shopping or downtown districts.
Check the back of your ATM card to see which network your bank
belongs to and look for ATMs that display your network’s sign. You’re
probably connected to one of the two most popular networks: The
Cirrus (% 800-424-7787) and PLUS (% 800-843-7587). You can call
their toll-free numbers to obtain convenient locations in Florida. 
Be sure you know your personal identification number (PIN) before you
leave home and be sure to find out your daily withdrawal limit before you
depart. Also keep in mind that many banks impose a fee every time your
card is used at a different bank’s ATM. On top of this, the bank from which
you withdraw cash may charge its own fee. To compare banks’ ATM fees
within the U.S., use www.bankrate.com. For international withdrawal
fees, ask your bank.
Charging ahead with credit cards
Credit cards are a safe way to carry money: They also provide a conven-
ient record of all your expenses. Most major credit cards are accepted
throughout Florida, though some places only accept American Express,
MasterCard, and Visa. You can get cash advances from your credit cards
at any banks (although you start paying hefty interest on the advance
from the moment you receive the cash, and you don’t receive frequent-
flier miles on an airline credit card). At most banks, you don’t even need
to go to a teller; you can get a cash advance at the ATM if you know your
personal identification number (PIN). If you’ve forgotten your PIN or didn’t
even know you had one, call the phone number on the back of your credit
card and ask the bank to send it to you. It usually takes between five and
seven business days, though some banks will give you the number over
the phone if you tell them your mother’s maiden name or pass some
other security clearance. 
Toting traveler’s checks
These days, traveler’s checks are less necessary because most cities
have 24-hour ATMs that allow you to withdraw small amounts of cash as
needed. However, keep in mind that you will likely be charged an ATM
withdrawal fee if the bank is not your own, so if you’re withdrawing money
every day, you may be better off with traveler’s checks — provided that
you don’t mind showing identification every time you want to cash one. 
You can get traveler’s checks at almost any bank. American Express
offers denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and (for cardholders only)
$1,000. You’ll pay a service charge ranging from 1 percent to 4 percent.
Chapter 3: Managing Your Money 43

You can also get American Express traveler’s checks over the phone by
calling % 800-221-7282; Amex gold and platinum cardholders who use
this number are exempt from the 1 percent fee. 
Visa offers traveler’s checks at Citibank locations nationwide as well as at
several other banks. The service charge ranges between 1.5 percent and
2 percent; checks come in denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and
$1,000. Call % 800-732-1322 for information. AAA members can obtain
Visa checks for a $9.95 service fee at most AAA offices or by calling % 866-
339-3378. MasterCard also offers traveler’s checks. Call % 800-223-9920
for a location near you. 
If you choose to carry traveler’s checks, be sure to keep a record of
their serial numbers separate from your checks in the event that they
are stolen or lost. You get a refund faster if you know the numbers.
Dealing with a lost or stolen wallet 
Be sure to contact all your credit card companies the minute you discover
your wallet has been lost or stolen and file a report at the nearest police
precinct. Your credit card company or insurer may require a police report
number or record of the loss. Most credit card companies have an emer-
gency toll-free number to call if your card is lost or stolen; they may be
able to wire you a cash advance immediately or deliver an emergency
credit card in a day or two. Call the following emergency numbers in the
United States:
 American Express % 800-221-7282 (for cardholders and traveler’s
check holders)
 MasterCard % 800-307-7309 or 636-722-7111
 Visa % 800-847-2911 or 410-581-9994
For other credit cards, call the toll-free number directory at % 800-
555-1212. 
If you need emergency cash over the weekend when all banks and
American Express offices are closed, you can have money wired to
you via Western Union (% 800-325-6000; www.westernunion.com). 
Identity theft and fraud are potential complications of losing your wallet,
especially if you’ve lost your driver’s license along with your cash and
credit cards. Notify the major credit-reporting bureaus immediately;
placing a fraud alert on your records may protect you against liability
for criminal activity. The three major U.S. credit-reporting agencies are
Equifax (% 800-766-0008; www.equifax.com), Experian (% 888-
397-3742; www.experian.com), and TransUnion (% 800-680-7289;
www.transunion.com). Finally, if you’ve lost all forms of photo ID call
your airline and explain the situation; airline personnel may allow you to
board the plane if you have a copy of your passport or birth certificate
and a copy of the police report you’ve filed.

G
etting there isn’t half the fun for most travelers, especially those
of us enduring longer airport lines, stewing over flight delays, or
getting bumped involuntarily by airlines that overbook their flights.
But the trip doesn’t have to be an expensive hassle. In this chapter, 
I cut through the baloney and make sure you have an easier time than
those who didn’t map out their campaign in advance.
Flying to Florida
All the major U.S. domestic carriers, many of the international ones,
and some charter services offer regular flights into Florida’s top four
destinations. (In order, they are Miami, Orlando, Tampa, and Fort
Lauderdale–Hollywood International airports.) Combined, this four-pack
handles up to 100 million passengers in a banner tourism year. (See the
Appendix in the back of the book for a list of toll-free numbers and Web
sites for the major airlines.) And if the mainstream airports don’t serve
your preferred drop zone, the state has 13 more international and regional
airports with moderate to limited jet service, meaning you may have to
deal with an extra connection, but you shouldn’t have trouble landing
near most any Florida destination.
Getting the best deal on your airfare
Competition among the major U.S. airlines is unlike that of any other
industry. Every airline offers virtually the same product (basically, a
coach seat is a coach seat is a . . .), yet prices can vary by hundreds
of dollars.
Business travelers and others who need the flexibility to buy their tickets
at the last minute and change their itineraries at a moment’s notice —
and who want to get home before the weekend — pay the premium rate,
known as the full fare. But if you can book your ticket far in advance, stay

over Saturday night, and are willing to travel midweek (Tues, Wed, or
Thurs), you can qualify for the least expensive price — usually a fraction
of the full fare. On most flights, even the shortest hops within the United
States, the full fare is close to $1,000 or more, but a 7- or 14-day advance
purchase ticket may cost less than half of that amount. Obviously, plan-
ning ahead pays.
The airlines also periodically hold sales, in which they lower the prices
on their most popular routes. These fares have advance purchase
requirements and date-of-travel restrictions, but you can’t beat the
prices. As you plan your vacation, keep your eyes open for these sales,
which tend to take place in seasons of low travel volume — November,
December, and January (excluding holidays). You almost never see a
sale around the peak summer vacation months of July and August, or
around Thanksgiving or Christmas, when many people fly, regardless
of the fare they have to pay. 
Consolidators, also known as bucket shops, are great sources for interna-
tional tickets, although they usually can’t beat the Internet on fares within
North America. Start by looking in Sunday newspaper travel sections;
U.S. travelers should focus on the New York Times, Los Angeles Times,
and Miami Herald.
Bucket shop tickets are usually nonrefundable or rigged with stiff cancel-
lation penalties, often as high as 50 percent to 75 percent of the ticket
price, and some put you on charter airlines with questionable safety
records. 
Several reliable consolidators are worldwide and available on the Net.
STA Travel (% 800-781-4040; www.statravel.com), the world’s leader
in student travel, offers good fares for travelers of all ages. FlyCheap
(% 800-FLY-CHEAP; www.1800flycheap.com) is owned by package-
holiday megalith MyTravel and so has especially good access to fares
for sunny destinations. Air Tickets Direct (% 800-778-3447; www.air
ticketsdirect.com) is based in Montreal and leverages the currently
weak Canadian dollar for low fares; it’ll also book trips to places that
U.S. travel agents won’t touch, such as Cuba.
Here are some tips for discovering the best values on airfare to Florida:
 Ask the airlines for their lowest fares. Be certain about your travel
dates before you call because many of the best deals are nonrefund-
able. Also, call more than once — often, you’ll get different rates on
different days, as cheap seats get sold out, or added, as airlines try
to fill up the planes. The best time to call: just after midnight, when
airlines tend to release additional cheap seats into their “inventory.”
If you do get a rate that’s lower than previous quotes, get a con-
firmation number (the airlines will usually hold a reservation for
24 hours before making you book a ticket). After shopping around,
go with the best rate, and cancel the others.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Florida 
46

Check fares both by phone and on the Internet. Airlines often
offer cheaper fares on their Web sites than through their telephone
reservation lines.
 Be flexible. The more flexible you are about your travel schedule
and length of stay, the more money you’re likely to save. Flying
during off times (at night, for instance) saves you money.
 Consider using a travel agent to find out about all your available
options. Sometimes a good agent knows about fares that you won’t
find on your own. Also, Internet providers offer travel sections that
may include pricing comparisons.
 Travel on “no-frills” airlines. Several so-called no-frills airlines —
with low fares but no meals or other amenities — serve Florida. The
biggest is Southwest Airlines (% 800-435-9792; www.southwest.
com), which flies to Jacksonville, West Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale,
Orlando, and Tampa. Spirit Air (% 800-772-7117; www.spiritair.
com) is another option. JetBlue Airways (% 800-538-2583; www.
jetblue.com) is a low-cost carrier that operates mostly on the
eastern seaboard but also flies from the West Coast.
 Consider joining a travel club, such as Moment’s Notice (% 718-234-
6295) or Sears Discount Travel Club (% 800-433-9383 for informa-
tion or 800-255-1487 to join). They supply unsold tickets to members
at discounted prices. (You pay an annual fee to receive the club’s
hotline number.) Of course, your choices are limited to what’s avail-
able, so you have to be flexible. Keep in mind, however, that you
may not have to join these clubs to get such deals because many
airlines now unload unsold seats directly through their Web sites.
Booking your flight online
The “big three” online travel agencies, Expedia (www.expedia.com),
Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), and Orbitz (www.orbitz.com)
sell most of the air tickets bought on the Internet. (Canadian travelers
should try www.expedia.ca and www.travelocity.ca; U.K. residents
can go for expedia.co.uk and opodo.co.uk.) Each has different busi-
ness deals with the airlines and may offer different fares on the same
flights, so shopping around is wise. Expedia and Travelocity will also
send you an e-mail notification when a cheap fare becomes available to
your favorite destination. Of the smaller travel agency Web sites, SideStep
(www.sidestep.com) receives good reviews from users. It’s a browser
add-on that purports to “search 140 sites at once,” but in reality only
beats competitors’ fares as often as other sites do.
If you’re willing to give up some control over your flight details, use an
opaque fare service like Priceline (www.priceline.com) or Hotwire
(www.hotwire.com). Both offer rock-bottom prices in exchange for
travel on a “mystery airline” at a mysterious time of day, often with a
mysterious change of planes en route. The mystery airlines are all major,
Chapter 4: Getting to Florida 47

well-known carriers — and the possibility of being sent from Chicago
to Tampa via Los Angeles is remote. But your chances of getting a 6 a.m.
or 11 p.m. flight are pretty high. Hotwire tells you flight prices before
you buy; Priceline usually has better deals than Hotwire, but you have
to play their “name our price” game. Note: In 2004 Priceline added
nonopaque service to its roster. You now have the option to pick exact
flights, times, and airlines from a list of offers — or opt to bid on opaque
fares as before.
Great last-minute deals are also available directly from the airlines them-
selves through a free e-mail service called E-savers. Each week, the airline
sends you a list of discounted flights, usually leaving the upcoming Friday
or Saturday and returning the following Monday or Tuesday. You can sign
up for all the major airlines at one time by logging on to Smarter Living
(www.smarterliving.com), or you can go to each individual airline’s
Web site. Airline sites also offer schedules, flight booking, and informa-
tion on late-breaking bargains.
Driving to Florida
Can’t stand to fly? Can’t afford the extra expense? You’re not alone. Each
year, many people get behind the wheel and drive themselves to their
sunny Florida destination. 
Driving to Florida is a less expensive and potentially more scenic option
than flying, but the distance may be so great that it eats up too much of
your vacation. Here’s how far several cities are from Orlando. (If you’re
going to Miami, add about 200 miles to each figure; if you’re only going
to northern Florida, subtract about 200.)
 Atlanta: 436 miles
 Boston: 1,312 miles
 Chicago: 1,120 miles
 Cleveland: 1,009 miles
 Dallas: 1,170 miles
 Detroit: 1,114 miles
 New York: 1,088 miles
 Toronto: 1,282 miles
Need directions? No problem. Use the following routes and after you’re
in Florida, pick up the highway that leads to your destination:
 From Atlanta, take I-75 South.
 From Boston and New York, take I-95 South.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Florida 
48

 From Chicago, take I-65 South to Nashville and then I-24 South to 
I-75 South.
 From Cleveland, take I-77 South to Columbia, South Carolina, and
then I-26 East to I-95 South.
 From Dallas, take I-20 East to I-49 South, to I-10 East, to I-75 South.
 From Detroit, take I-75 South.
 From Toronto, take Canadian Route 401 South to Queen Elizabeth
Way South, to I-90 (New York State Thruway) East, to I-87 (New York
State Thruway) South, to I-95 over the George Washington Bridge,
and continue south on I-95.
AAA (% 800-222-4357; www.aaa.com) and some other automobile clubs
offer free maps and driving directions to their members.
Getting to Florida by Rail
Don’t want to fly but can’t stand the thought of driving all the way to
Florida? Hop a train! Amtrak trains (% 800-872-7245; www.amtrak.com)
pull into several stations across Florida.
Amtrak’s Auto Train allows you to bring your car to Florida without having
to drive it all the way. The service begins in Lorton, Virginia — about a
four-hour drive from New York; two hours from Philadelphia — and ends
at Sanford, Florida, about 23 miles northeast of Orlando. The Auto Train
departs Lorton and Sanford daily at 4:00 p.m., arriving at the other end
of the line the next day at about 8:30 a.m. Fares for the Auto Train vary
according to season and schedule, but fares for two passengers and a
car begin at $368.
As with airline fares, you can sometimes receive discounts if you book
train rides far in advance. However, discounts usually aren’t offered
around the very busy holiday periods. Amtrak features money-saving
packages, which include accommodations, car rentals, tours, and so on.
For package information, call % 800-321-8684.
Choosing a Package Tour
For popular destinations, such as Florida, packages can be a smart way
to go because they often offer discounts that you could never get if you
booked all the elements of your vacation separately. Package prices are
low because they’re sold in bulk to tour operators, who resell them to the
public. It’s kind of like buying your vacation at Sam’s Club or one of those
other membership discount clubs. Except here, the tour operator buys
the 1,000-count box of garbage bags and resells them ten at a time, at a
cost that undercuts what you’d pay at your neighborhood supermarket. 
Chapter 4: Getting to Florida 49

Package tours can vary as much as those garbage bags, too. Some offer
a better class of hotels than others; others provide the same hotels for
lower prices. Some book flights on scheduled airlines; others sell char-
ters. In some packages, your choice of accommodations and travel days
may be limited. Some let you choose between escorted vacations and
independent vacations; others allow you to add on just a few excursions
or escorted day-trips (also at discounted prices) without booking an
entirely escorted tour.
To find package tours, check out the travel section of your local Sunday
newspaper or the ads in the back of national travel magazines such as
Travel & Leisure, National Geographic Traveler, and Condé Nast Traveler.
Liberty Travel (call % 888-271-1584 to find the store nearest you; www.
libertytravel.com) is one of the biggest packagers in the Northeast
and usually boasts a full-page ad in Sunday papers.
Some of the most popular Florida packages revolve around Orlando and
its theme parks. The major parks themselves offer numerous packages:
 Walt Disney World (see Chapters 17–19) offers a dizzying array of
packages, some of which include airfare, a room in a Disney or related
property, theme-park passes, a rental car, meals, a Disney cruise,
and/or a stay at Disney’s beach resorts in Vero Beach, Florida, or
Hilton Head, South Carolina. You can get more information about
Disney packages by calling % 800-828-0228 or 407-828-8101, heading
online to www.disneyworld.com, or writing to Walt Disney World,
Box 10000, Lake Buena Vista, FL 32830-1000. Ask for a Walt Disney
World Vacations brochure or video.
 Universal Orlando packages, although not on the same scale as
Disney, have improved greatly, with the addition of the Islands of
Adventure theme park (see Chapter 18); the CityWalk food-and-club
district (Chapter 19); and the Portofino Bay, Hard Rock, and Royal
Pacific resorts (Chapter 17). The menu includes rooms, VIP access
to the parks, and discounts to other non-Disney attractions. Universal
also offers packages that include travel, transportation, and cruises.
Contact Universal Studios Vacations at % 888-322-5537 or 407-224-
7000, or go online to www.universalorlando.com.
 SeaWorld offers two- and three-night packages that include rooms
at a few Orlando hotels including the Renaissance Orlando Resort
at SeaWorld (see Chapter 17), car rental, tickets to SeaWorld (see
Chapter 18), and in some cases, other theme parks. Get information
at % 800-423-8368, or online at www.seaworld.com.
The competition is stiff not only in Orlando but also in other major Florida
tourist destinations, including Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Daytona Beach,
and Tampa/St. Petersburg. Check the packagers I list in this section to
see what options they offer in your chosen destination.

Airline packages
Another good source of package deals is the airlines themselves. Delta
Vacations (% 800-872-7786; www.deltavacations.com), the big fish in
the pond, offers selections that can include round-trip airfare, lodging
(including tax and baggage tips), a rental car with unlimited mileage or
round-trip transfers from the airport, admission to some theme parks,
accommodations, and so on. Prices for Delta Vacations usually vary
depending on the package, property, departure city, and season.
Continental Airlines Vacations, (% 800-301-3800; www.coolvacations.
com), offers several packages that include airfare, car rental, and hotel
stays at numerous central Florida hotels and WDW resorts. You can
apply the airline’s frequent-flier miles to some packages and you can
make reservations with or without air service. 
For other airline-package possibilities, see the phone numbers and Web
sites for various airlines listed in the Appendix in the back of this book.
Other package resources
Besides airline and theme-park packages, you can also find packages
elsewhere. One option is American Express Travel (% 800-732-1991;
http://travel.americanexpress.com/travel/travel). It lets
American Express card holders book reservations around the state
while throwing in perks like discounts on merchandise, dinner shows,
and sometimes tours.
Other package specialists include the following:
 Touraine Travel (% 800-967-5583; www.tourainetravel.com)
offers a wide variety of tour packages to Disney and Disney prop-
erties, Universal Orlando, SeaWorld, and other parts of Florida.
 If you’re a linkster, you have several packagers from which to choose.
Golf Getaways (% 800-800-4028; www.golfgetaways.com) and
Golfpac Vacations (% 800-327-0878; www.golfpacinc.com) offer
a slate of play-and-stay packages — from basic to extraordinarily
comprehensive ones.

lorida feeds on tourists — conservatively, about 50 million a
year. So, the tourism czars make sure that you and your fellow
49,999,999 travelers can go from Point A to Point B as quickly as 
possible.
You may end up flying to Florida and rarely venturing more than 25 miles
from the airport. Or you may do a little in-state traveling. In this chapter,
I provide information on the four most popular ways to get around Florida,
in case you want to hit the road while you’re here.
By Car
You won’t need a car if you stick to single-destination vacations, includ-
ing Disney/Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, Miami Beach, Key West, Daytona
Beach, and St. Petersburg/Clearwater. However, bringing or renting a set
of wheels is the best and easiest way to see the sights, especially if you
plan to visit more than one city.
The fact that traveling around Florida is easy and convenient, doesn’t
mean that it’s quick. The large distances between cities — 542 miles
from Key West to Jacksonville, for example — can make for a lengthy
drive, and the traffic on the state’s major highways will only make the
trip longer. See the “Florida Driving Times and Distances” map in this
chapter to get an idea of how much time you’ll spend on the road.

Florida Driving Times and Distances
 Rush hour: In Florida, rush hour generally runs from 7 to 9 a.m.
and 4 to 6 p.m. on weekdays. Traffic during these times can be
brutal in cities such as Miami, Orlando, and Tampa, more so if
you use the interstates and other major highways. (Orlando has
rush hour on the weekends, too, thanks to the theme parks.)
Most toll roads, however, tend to be less congested, so it does
pay to pay up.
 The more the merrier: Several counties (most notably Miami-Dade)
operate special High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes on major
roads and highways. In order to use these lanes (usually faster than
the regular traffic lanes), you need to have a minimum number of
passengers in the car (usually three or higher). Don’t get in an HOV
lane if your car isn’t carrying the requisite number of passengers —
you could be fined several hundred dollars.

 Red means go: Florida law allows drivers to make a right turn on
red, after coming to a full stop and making sure the coast is clear
(unless signs say otherwise).
 Speed demons beware: Posted speed limits are enforced pretty
vigorously. The speed limits on Florida’s interstates and major
highways usually are 55 to 70 mph. The limit is 55 mph on many
other roads, but it dips as low as 10 to 20 mph in school zones.
Fines for speeding begin at more than $150. In particular, mind
the reduced speed limits in school zones, where fines are 
doubled. 
 Buckle up: Driving without using a seat belt is illegal, and the local
police actively ticket violators.
 Safety issues: Ask someone at your hotel’s front desk, your rental-car
agency, the local chamber of commerce, or the police department
about which routes in the area are safe for travel and which should
be avoided. Be particularly wary of high-crime areas and ultrarural
roads. Also, be extra careful at night, especially regarding where
you park. Try to stay in well-lit, public areas.
 Permits: A handicap permit is required for parking in places des-
ignated for the disabled. Handicap permits from other states are
honored, but a disabled license plate alone won’t do the job.
 Emergencies: You can reach the Florida Highway Patrol on a cell-
phone by dialing *FHP. From a regular phone, dial 911.
Renting some wheels
Car-rental rates depend on the size of the car, the length of time you
keep it, where and when you pick it up and drop it off, special discounts,
and other factors. Asking the following questions can help save hundreds
of dollars when renting a car:
 Is the weekend rate lower than the weekday rate? Ask if the rate
for Friday-morning pickup is the same as on Thursday night. If you’re
keeping the car five or more days, a weekly rate should be cheaper
than the daily rate.
 Will I be charged a drop-off fee if I return the car to a location
that’s different from where I rented it? Some companies assess
a drop-off charge, while others, notably National, do not. Ask 
if the rate is cheaper if you pick up the car at the airport or in 
town.
 May I have the price I saw advertised in the newspaper? Be sure
to ask for that rate; otherwise, you may be charged the standard
(higher) rate. Don’t forget to mention membership in AAA, AARP,
frequent-flier programs, and trade unions, which usually entitle you
to discounts ranging from 5 to 30 percent. Ask your travel agent to
check these special rates. Also remember that most car rentals add
at least 500 miles on your frequent-flier account.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Florida 
54

If you want information about the major rental-car companies serving
Florida, see the Appendix in the back of this guide.
Ringing up the cost of renting a car
On top of the standard rental prices, other optional charges apply to most
car rentals. The Collision Damage Waiver (CDW), which covers what you
would be required to pay for damage to the car in a collision, is charged
on rentals in most states. However, many credit card companies cover
this expense. Check with your credit card company before you go so that
you can avoid paying this hefty fee (as much as $15 a day).
Rental companies also offer additional liability insurance (if you harm
others in an accident), personal-accident insurance (if you harm yourself
or your passengers), and personal-effects insurance (if your luggage is
stolen from your car). If you have insurance on your car at home, you’re
probably covered for most of these unexpected events. If your own insur-
ance doesn’t cover you for rentals, or if you don’t have auto insurance,
consider buying additional coverage (rental companies are liable for cer-
tain base amounts). But weigh the likelihood of getting into an accident
or losing your luggage against the cost of this extra coverage, which can
run as much as $20 a day.
Some companies also offer refueling packages — you pay for an entire
tank of gas upfront. The price is usually fairly competitive with local gas
prices, but you don’t get credit for any gas remaining in the tank when
you return the car. If you reject this option, you pay only for the gas you
use, but you have to return the rental with a full tank or face charges of
$3 to $4 a gallon for any shortfall. If a stop at a gas station on the way to
the airport will make you miss your plane, by all means take advantage
of the fuel-purchase option. Otherwise, skip it.
Also expect some hefty taxes — as much as 20 percent — to your base
rental rate. If you rent your car in an airport, you may be charged an
additional fee on top of the taxes. To estimate the true rental price, ask
for a rundown of all the applicable taxes and fees assessed on your car.
Most rental companies have a minimum age requirement for renters,
usually 25, and some have a maximum age limit. When they do rent to the
under-25 crowd, rental companies charge an extra $10 to $20 per day in
young-renter fees. Most companies will also refuse to rent you a car if
you have a poor driving record or you don’t have a credit card.
Booking a rental on the Internet
Using the Internet can make comparison shopping and reserving a rental
car much easier. All the major booking Web sites — including Travelocity
(www.travelocity.com), Expedia (www.expedia.com), and Yahoo!
Travel (www.travel.yahoo.com) — offer search engines that find dis-
counted rental rates. Enter the size of the car you want, pickup and return
dates, and the city where you’ll rent it, and the server returns a price.
You can also make reservations through these sites.
Chapter 5: Getting around Florida 55

By Plane
The commuter branches of several major airlines provide extensive serv-
ice to many Florida cities. Fares for short hops are usually reasonable.
The three most popular airlines for intrastate travel are:
 Continental: % 800-525-0280; www.continental.com
 Delta: % 800-221-1212; www.delta.com
 US Airways: % 800-428-4322; www.usair.com
Cape Air (% 800-352-0714; www.flycapeair.com), a small commuter
airline, flies from Key West to Fort Myers, Naples, and Fort Lauderdale,
which means you can avoid backtracking to Miami from Key West if
you’re touring. 
All major carriers offer service to Florida’s busiest airports: Miami
International (% 305-876-7000; www.miami-airport.com) and
Orlando International (% 407-825-2001; www.orlandoairports.net).
Tampa International (% 813-870-8700; www.tampaairport.com) and
Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International (% 954-359-6100; www.
broward.org/fll.htm) are nearly as popular.
Most big-name domestic airlines serve the following international airports.
If you fly into these airports from outside Florida, you may have to make
an extra connection, and fares are often higher than flying into a bigger
airport such as Miami or Orlando. This group includes:
 Palm Beach (% 561-471-7412; www.pbia.org)
 Southwest Florida, Fort Myers (% 941-768-4700; www.swfia.com)
 Jacksonville (% 904-741-2000; www.jaxairports.org)
 Sarasota Bradenton (% 941-359-2770; www.srq-airport.com)
Many large domestic carriers, their express services, and commuter air-
lines serve this next tier in the airport food chain:
 Pensacola Regional (% 850-436-5000; www.flypensacola.com)
 Orlando Sanford International (% 407-585-4000; www.orlando
sanfordairport.com)
 St. Petersburg–Clearwater International (% 727-535-7600; www.
stpete-clwairport.com)
 Daytona Beach International (% 386-248-8030; www.flydaytona
first.com)
 Melbourne International (% 321-723-6227; www.mlbair.com)
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Florida 
56

 Key West International (% 305-296-5439; www.keywest
internationalairport.com)
 Panama City–Bay County International (% 850-763-6751; www.
pcairport.com)
In most cases, you’ll choose the airport closest to your vacation base.
For example, if your destination is the Pinellas County Gulf beaches
(see Chapter 15), you can save yourself a one-hour drive from the
major airport in the area, Tampa International, if you instead fly into
St. Petersburg–Clearwater International. Likewise, if Key West is your
goal, you’ll save at least three hours in driving time by landing there
instead of Miami International. However, far fewer carriers serve the
smaller airports, and airfares often are more expensive.
See the Appendix in the back of this book for the toll-free phone numbers
and Web sites of the most popular airlines that serve Florida.
By Train
Train travel from one Florida destination to another isn’t very feasible
due to sporadic scheduling and frequent stops and starts. Getting from
Daytona Beach to Fort Lauderdale, for example, takes 81⁄2 hours by train,
but by car the same trip takes less than 4 hours. However, if trains are
in your travel plans, Amtrak (% 800-872-7245; www.amtrak.com) runs
trains to 50 cities in Florida, including Daytona, Fort Lauderdale, Key West,
Miami, Orlando, Tampa, and St. Petersburg.
By Bus
I list public transportation services in the destination chapters.
Greyhound (% 800-231-2222; www.greyhound.com) is an option for
intercity travel, but it has the same problems — slow and sporadic 
service — as train travel. It also doesn’t give you the flexibility that a
rental car does.

Booking Your
Accommodations
In This Chapter
 Considering your options
 Getting the best for less
H
otel, motel, Holiday Inn! Florida is a haven of hotels ranging from
kitschy mom-and-pop spots, reliable chains, swanky destination
resorts, theme stays, B&Bs, and boutique hotels. It all depends on what
you’re in the mood for and how much you are willing to spend. 
In this chapter, I focus on the essentials about accommodations, including
what you get for your money (and how to get more). I also offer some tips
throughout for finding particularly personable digs.
Getting to Know Your Options
Although Florida sports a wide variety of accommodations, for the
most part, this guide concentrates on Florida’s four main lodging
types. I use a handy little dollar sign code for the amount of dough
you have to hand over when you decide to stay in these places. The
explanation for the code is in the “Key to Hotel Dollar Signs” table,
later in this chapter.
 Resorts usually offer just about everything you can get with a
room. Features vary from property to property, but amenities are
often in the $$$$ category. The resorts are usually right on the
beach, in the best neighborhoods, or in the heart of the action. If
you’re so inclined, resorts can be one-stop destinations that
offer package deals and good rates during the off-season. But keep
in mind that you won’t feel like part of the family, and they usually
cost top dollar.

 Hotels sometimes have accommodations similar to resorts, but
they’re generally smaller and offer fewer activities and facilities.
Hotels usually offer daily housekeeping service, one or more swim-
ming pools, one or more lounges and restaurants, room service, and
an activities desk. Hotels can be more intimate than a resort and offer
slightly cheaper rates, but they have fewer amenities and services.
The locations may not be as good, and hotels can have thin walls.
 Motels, whether chains or mom-and-pop operations, generally have
basic rooms and amenities, the kind found in the $ and, in a few
cases, $$ categories. The rooms tend to be smaller, a good restau-
rant (or perhaps any restaurant) likely won’t be on the premises,
and their locations are often farther from the action. But the price
is right, and most of us don’t go on vacation to spend much time in
the room.
 Bed-and-breakfasts are plentiful in Florida and a good way to experi-
ence a home-style visit. The locations, usually situated outside of the
tourist mainstream, may be a perk for you, particularly if you’re the
kind of traveler who likes the feeling of staying in someone’s home.
Bed-and-breakfasts vary widely in size and services. On one end of
the scale, some have tight quarters and shared baths, while others
have private sitting areas, lavish amenities, and private whirlpool
tubs. At either end, don’t expect a great deal of service beyond break-
fast, bed and towel service, and, sometimes, evening dessert or a
glass of wine. Bed-and-breakfasts are hardly ever on the beach, so
if your heart’s set on that ocean view, you should consider another
style of accommodation.
The Florida Bed & Breakfast Inns Association, P.O. Box 6187, Palm
Harbor, FL 34684 (% 800-524-1880; www.florida-inns.com), pub-
lishes a nifty guide, Inns of Florida, which offers descriptions of a
number of inns and bed-and-breakfasts in the state. The association
inspects all the listed properties.
In addition to the four main lodging categories, I also touch on a few con-
dominiums and vacation rentals. These accommodations are good if you
have a large family, like the spaciousness of a house or an apartment,
or plan to stay in an area for a few weeks or longer. But they tend to be
pricey, and there usually isn’t on-site management, so service is slow or
nonexistent.
The hotels, motels, and resorts listed in the destination areas of this
book (see Chapters 9 through 21) are grouped by price, from budget
motels to very expensive rooms and apartments. The rates I quote in
those chapters are per night, based on double occupancy. To give you
a better idea of what you can expect to get for your money, here’s a
menu of the amenities that may be offered in each price category:
Chapter 6: Booking Your Accommodations 59

Table 6-1
Key to Hotel Dollar Signs
Dollar 
Price Range
What to Expect
Sign(s)
$
Less than $100
Accommodations at this level generally have pretty
basic trimmings and limited space. They also tend to lean
toward the no-frills side (although almost all come with
swimming pools and air-conditioning). Accommodations
at the higher end of this category may have hair dryers
and coffeemakers, cable TV, and kids’ play areas, and
they sometimes offer free continental breakfasts. If
they’re multistory, they usually have an elevator.
$$
$100–$199
Within this category, you’ll probably have a choice of
king-size or double beds, a full range of amenities (cof-
feemakers, hair dryers, two TVs in two-room models,
multiline phones, maybe modem lines, VCRs, free daily
newspapers, and so on), designer shampoos, and room
service. Rooms are slightly larger, and the pools may
be joined by a whirlpool and fitness center. The conti-
nental breakfast probably has fresh fruit, granola, and
muffins, rather than day-old doughnuts and those pint-
size boxes of dry cereal. The hotel may even have a
palatable on-site restaurant.
$$$
$200–$249
Hotels at this level tack on guest-services desks where
you can arrange sightseeing trips, attractions tickets,
and restaurant reservations. They probably have large,
resort-style pools with multiple whirlpool tubs (some of
the higher-end rooms have their own), fitness centers,
and, occasionally, small spas. Rooms have multiple
phones, beds, and TVs. They also often have minibars
and separate tubs and showers.
$$$$
$250 and up
With these accommodations, nothing is outside the realm
of possibility, including a world-class fitness center. In
addition to the nicer amenities in the earlier price cate-
gories, many of the hotels here have concierge levels,
loaded rooms, 24-hour room service, gorgeous pool bars,
and live entertainment in their lounges. Some have full-
service spas, gourmet restaurants, and tight security.
Getting the Best Room at the Best Rate
Some folks call a hotel, ask for a rate, and pay it — no questions asked.
This practice is like going to a car lot and paying the sticker price. If this
description hits a little too close to home, just read on. In this chapter,
I show you how to find the best hotel rates and get the best room that
your money can buy.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Florida 
60

Finding the best rate
The rack rate is the maximum rate a hotel charges for a room. It’s the
rate you get if you walk in off the street and ask for a room for the night.
You sometimes see these rates printed on the fire/emergency exit dia-
grams posted on the back of your door.
Hotels are happy to charge you the rack rate, but you can almost
always do better. Perhaps the best way to avoid paying the rack rate
is surprisingly simple: Just ask for a cheaper or discounted rate. You
may be pleasantly surprised.
In all but the smallest accommodations, the rate you pay for a room
depends on many factors — chief among them being how you make
your reservation. A travel agent may be able to negotiate a better price
with certain hotels than you can get by yourself. (That’s because the
hotel often gives the agent a discount in exchange for steering his or
her business toward that hotel.)
Seasons also affect room rates, especially as occupancy rises and
falls. Most Florida destinations are in peak season during summer and
holidays (when kids are out of school and their families travel) and
during winter (mainly between Jan and Mar when snowbirds come
south). If a hotel is nearly full, it’s less likely to offer you a discount.
Likewise, if the hotel is nearly empty, an employee may negotiate a
room rate with you, especially if the hotel is locally owned. Some
resorts offer midweek specials, and downtown hotels often offer
cheaper weekend rates.
Orlando, for the most part, doesn’t have a normal pattern of high
and low seasons. Blame two things for this: Disney’s year-round
tourist appeal, and a convention schedule that never takes much of
a breather. Many Orlando hotels do, however, offer lower rates from
early January through March (it’s not a mecca for snowbirds), from
just after Labor Day to just before Thanksgiving, and for the first two
weeks of December. If you plan to hit a destination during its busy
season, your best shot at getting a discount is to reserve early —
months in advance, if possible.
Please note that room prices are subject to change without notice, so
even the rack rates quoted in this book may be different from the actual
rate you receive when you make your reservation.
Finding the best hotel rate requires a bit of detective work. For example,
reserving a room through the hotel’s toll-free number may result in a
lower rate than calling the hotel directly. On the other hand, the central
reservations number may not know about discount rates at specific loca-
tions. For example, local franchises may offer a special group rate for a
wedding or family reunion, but they may neglect to tell the central book-
ing line. Your best bet is to call both the local number and the toll-free
number and see which one gives you a better deal.
Chapter 6: Booking Your Accommodations 61

Ask about discounts if you’re a student, senior, military or government
employee, police officer, firefighter, or member of AAA or AARP. Also, if
you own stock in a hotel company, you may be eligible for some kind of
a price break or other perk. When you settle on your destination, make
sure to contact the local visitor information center (see the Appendix in
the back of this book) by phone or via the Web to see if it has any dis-
counts available. Most have plenty of them.
When budgeting for your room, don’t forget to allow for the combined
sales and bed taxes that are charged in the state’s various counties. In
some parts of Florida, they add as much as 12 or 13 percent to your bill.
Getting the view — or not
Views are one of the most heavily advertised amenities offered by hotels
located in Florida’s coastal cities. Sure, it would be nice to see the sun
appear or disappear over the ocean from your room, but is a room with a
view worth the money? You may pay an extra $50, $100, or more per night
for a view of sea oats, sand dunes, and frothy waves. If money’s no object
or if that restful view is the top priority of your vacation, then damn the
torpedoes. Full speed ahead. But if you won’t be hanging out in your
room very much, you can find better ways to blow your inheritance.
Want to know exactly what you get when the hotel offers you a view?
Here’s the scorecard:
 Oceanfront: This usually means your room is smack-dab on the
beach, which is synonymous with being 8 feet under water during
a hurricane tide. It also means you’re going to pay for that location.
But it doesn’t necessarily mean you actually get a view of the ocean,
so ask. Some of Florida’s less-than-reputable innkeepers advertise
themselves as oceanfront because a room in a building faces the
tides, even if your room doesn’t. You also may not be able to walk
straight out your door to the beach — many of these places are
high-rises where it’s highly recommended that you go down before
you go out. Don’t forget to ask about elevator service. Going down-
stairs is a piece of cake; going up is a gravity-defying experience.
Be sure to find out exactly what you’re getting.
 Oceanview: These rooms are usually guaranteed to be at the top of
the price chart. Your shoulders will be squared to the beach, but you
may not be oceanfront. You may actually be several hundred feet
back, overlooking air-conditioning units on some shorter buildings.
Again, remember to ask. Remember, too, when staying in a high-rise,
that if surf sounds are what’s important, make sure you’re on one of
the first few floors. You won’t be able to hear the waves above the
fourth or fifth floors. Their sounds usually yield to the roar of airline
engines or the complaints of high-flying gulls.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Florida 
62

 Partial oceanview: This is where semantics come into play. If you
look east, at sunset on an odd-numbered Thursday . . . well, you get
the idea. You may be able to see the surf from half the windows in
your L-shaped condo, or maybe you can see it if you press your nose
into the glass and stare cross-eyed to the left. It may be a great deal
or a great rip-off. Our best advice: Take it if it’s offered, but don’t
pay a penny extra. 
 Other views: Depending on where you land in Florida, you may
encounter a room with views of a marsh, garden, wildlife habitat, or
any of Florida’s other natural treasures, including waste-treatment
plants. But don’t buy in if the brochure promises a mountain view —
there are none.
Surfing the Web for hotel deals
Shopping online for hotels is generally done one of two ways: by booking
through the hotel’s own Web site or through an independent booking
agency (or a fare-service agency like Priceline). These Internet hotel agen-
cies have multiplied in mind-boggling numbers of late, competing for the
business of millions of consumers surfing for accommodations around the
world. This competitiveness can be a boon to consumers who have the
patience and time to shop and compare the online sites for good deals —
but shop they must, because prices can vary considerably from site to site.
And keep in mind that hotels at the top of a site’s listing may be there for
no other reason than that they paid money to get the placement.
Of the “big three” sites, Expedia offers a long list of special deals and
“virtual tours” or photos of available rooms so you can see what you’re
paying for (a feature that helps counter the claims that the best rooms
are often held back from bargain booking Web sites). Travelocity posts
unvarnished customer reviews and ranks its properties according to the
AAA rating system. Also reliable are Hotels.com and Quikbook.com. An
excellent free program, Travelaxe (www.travelaxe.net), can help you
search multiple hotel sites at once, even ones you may never have heard
of — and conveniently lists the total price of the room, including the taxes
and service charges. Another booking site, Travelweb (www.travelweb),
is partly owned by the hotels it represents (including the Hilton, Hyatt,
and Starwood chains) and is therefore plugged directly into the hotels’
reservations systems — unlike independent online agencies, which have
to fax or e-mail reservation requests to the hotel, a good portion of which
get misplaced in the shuffle. More than once, travelers have arrived at
the hotel, only to be told that they have no reservation. To be fair, many
of the major sites are undergoing improvements in service and ease of
use, and Expedia will soon be able to plug directly into the reservations
systems of many hotel chains — none of which can be bad news for con-
sumers. In the meantime, it’s a good idea to get a confirmation number
and make a printout of any online booking transaction.
Chapter 6: Booking Your Accommodations 63

In the opaque Web site category, Priceline and Hotwire are even better
for hotels than for airfares; with both, you’re allowed to pick the neigh-
borhood and quality level of your hotel before offering up your money.
Priceline’s hotel product even covers Europe and Asia, though it’s much
better at getting five-star lodging for three-star prices than at finding
anything at the bottom of the scale. On the downside, many hotels stick
Priceline guests in their least desirable rooms. Be sure to go to the
BiddingforTravel Web site (www.biddingfortravel.com) before bidding
on a hotel room on Priceline; it features a fairly up-to-date list of hotels
that Priceline uses in major cities. For both Priceline and Hotwire, you
pay upfront, and the fee is nonrefundable. Note: Some hotels do not pro-
vide loyalty program credits or points or other frequent-stay amenities
when you book a room through opaque online services.
Florida Hotel Network (www.floridahotels.com) offers a centralized
reservations service for accommodations in a variety of price ranges for
major cities in Florida. If you want to book rooms for large groups, you
can do it here.
Most of the visitor information centers listed in the Appendix in the
back of this book have links to some of the hotels in their areas. Also,
many of the accommodations listings in Chapters 9 through 21 include
Web addresses. And you can also link to specific hotels at Visit Florida
(www.flausa.com) and Absolutely Florida (www.funandsun.com),
although getting to your desired choice on these sites will probably
require some patience.
Reserving the best room
After you make your reservation, asking one or two more pointed ques-
tions can go a long way toward making sure you get the best room in the
house. Always ask for a corner room. They’re usually larger, quieter, and
have more windows and light than standard rooms, and they don’t always
cost more. Also ask if the hotel is renovating; if it is, request a room away
from the renovation work. Inquire, too, about the location of the restau-
rants, bars, and discos in the hotel — all sources of annoying noise. 
If you book your room through a travel agent, ask the agent to note your
room preferences on your reservation. When you check in at your hotel,
your preferences will pop up when the reception desk pulls your reser-
vation. Special requests can’t be guaranteed, but ask in advance anyway.
If you aren’t happy with your room when you arrive, talk to the front desk.
If they have another room, they should be happy to accommodate you,
within reason.

t’s time to dispense a little advice for travelers with special needs.
The last thing you want or need is a vacation that’s too old, young,
restrictive, or full of obstacles for you or your lifestyle. There are so
many things to see and do in Florida that anybody should be able to
find something suitable. Many cities also provide specialized services
for those with special needs; so if you need help, just ask.
Traveling with the Brood: Advice for Families
Most of Florida’s major attractions were designed with kids in mind,
nearly all restaurants have special menus for young diners, and many
hotels let youngsters stay in their parents’ room at no extra charge or
for a small one. Many of Florida’s beach resorts offer activities for kids,
and in some cases, full daily programs to occupy their time. A number
of hotels also offer baby-sitting services so moms and dads can have
a night on their own. And Disney and Orlando cater to youngsters, day
or night.
You can find good family-oriented vacation advice on the Internet from
sites like the Family Travel Forum (www.familytravelforum.com), a
comprehensive site that offers customized trip planning; Family Travel
Network (www.familytravelnetwork.com), an award-winning site that
offers travel features, deals, and tips; and Family Travel Files (www.
thefamilytravelfiles.com), which offers an online magazine and a
directory of off-the-beaten-path tours and tour operators for families. 

Here are some general rules and reminders for your family to consider
when planning a trip to Florida:
 After you arrive, keep an eye out for discount coupons on meals
and attractions. Some are two-for-one specials, while others offer a
percentage taken off the regular price. You can find these coupons
in giveaway newspapers and magazines in the lobbies of hotels and
restaurants. Also, check the Friday entertainment sections in many
local newspapers.
 Remember — kids under 12, and in many cases under 18, stay
free in their parents’ room in most hotels. If you’re not sure of
a property’s policy, ask when making a reservation. Look for
places that have pools and other recreational facilities and then
spend a no-extra-expense day or two away from costly tourist
attractions.
 Consider setting up rules on such things as bedtimes and sou-
venirs. It can soften the disappointment after you arrive.
 Talk with your kids about what to do if they become separated
from you. It’s easy to get lost inside the larger tourist attractions
and areas. In their guide maps, many attractions outline what to do
if you and your child get separated. If your kids are 7 or under, attach
a nametag to the inside of their shirt or jacket. (If young children
are crying and scared, they may have trouble giving park staffers
their name.) For older kids, choose a place to reunite if they get
separated.
 Keep in mind that your home may be toddler-proof, but hotel
rooms aren’t. Bring blank plugs to cover outlets and whatever else
is necessary to prevent an accident from happening in your room.
Also, pack sunscreen and hats for the entire family, including infants
and toddlers. If you forget to bring sunscreen, buy some at a conven-
ience store or drugstore. Get a waterproof one that has an SPF rating
of 25 or higher. Young children should be slathered with sunscreen,
even if they’re in a stroller. Adults and children should also drink
plenty of water to avoid dehydration during Florida’s hot months,
especially May through September.
 Bring some lightweight snacks and bottled water in an easy-
to-carry backpack. They may save you headaches and money 
(concessions at attractions sometimes charge double or more
what the free world charges).
 Don’t try to do too much. By overextending yourselves, all
you’ll gain are hot, tired, and cranky kids. Take frequent breaks
when touring the major attractions and, if possible, go back to
your hotel room and spend a little down time before hitting the
sights again.
Part II: Planing Your Trip to Florida 
66

 Plan playtime for parents. It’s your vacation, too! If your hotel offers
a baby-sitting service, book a sitter for the night and go out for a
romantic dinner or another adult-oriented activity.
Making Age Work for You: Tips for Seniors
With the possible exception of kid-crazy Orlando, Florida is as popu-
lar among seniors (especially during the fall and winter months) as it
is with the families that come during holidays and summers. Many
Florida hotels, restaurants, and attractions roll out the red carpet for
older travelers.

Accessing Florida: Advice for 
Travelers with Disabilities
Most disabilities shouldn’t stop anyone from visiting Florida’s popular
tourist areas. There are more options and resources out there than ever
before, and the major destinations do a lot to lift barriers, including on
many of their rides.
You can get a free copy of the Planning Guide for Travelers with Disabilities
from Visit Florida, P.O. Box 1100, Tallahassee, FL 32302-1100 (% 888-735-
2872; www.flausa.com). Additionally, all the major theme parks in
Orlando offer guidebooks and other services that are specially geared
to disabled guests. Ask for these publications at the parks’ guest serv-
ices desks when you arrive.
The U.S. National Park Service offers a Golden Access Passport that gives
free lifetime entrance to all properties administered by the National Park
Service — national parks, monuments, historic sites, recreation areas, and
national wildlife refuges — for persons who are visually impaired or per-
manently disabled, regardless of age. You may pick up a Golden Access
Passport at any NPS entrance fee area by showing proof of medically
determined disability and eligibility for receiving benefits under federal
law. Besides free entry, the Golden Access Passport also offers a 50 per-
cent discount on federal-use fees charged for such facilities as camping,
swimming, parking, boat launching, and tours. For more information, go
online to www.nps.gov/fees_passes.htm or call % 888-467-2757.
Many travel agencies offer customized tours and itineraries for travelers
with disabilities. Flying Wheels Travel (% 507-451-5005; www.flying
wheelstravel.com) offers escorted tours and cruises that emphasize
sports and private tours in minivans with lifts. Access-Able Travel
Source (% 303-232-2979; www.access-able.com) offers extensive
access information and advice for traveling around the world with 
disabilities. Accessible Journeys (% 800-846-4537 or 610-521-0339;

Avis Rent a Car has an “Avis Access” program that offers such services
as a dedicated 24-hour toll-free number (% 888-879-4273) for customer
with special travel needs; special car features such as swivel seats, spin-
ner knobs, and hand controls; and accessible bus service.
Organizations that offer assistance to disabled travelers include the
MossRehab (www.mossresourcenet.org), which provides a library of
accessible-travel resources online; SATH (Society for Accessible Travel
and Hospitality) (% 212-447-7284; www.sath.org; annual membership

travelers with special needs; and Open World Magazine, published by
SATH (subscription: $13 per year, $21 outside the U.S.).
Following the Rainbow: Advice 
for Gay and Lesbian Travelers
Although Florida has a few pockets of intolerance, most of the larger
destinations have active gay and lesbian communities. Many of those
cities and several of the smaller coastal ones are especially receptive
to gay and lesbian guests. Miami’s South Beach and Key West are
extraordinarily popular with gay and lesbian travelers, and Orlando’s
Gay Days Celebration in June (corresponding with Gay Disney, which
takes place the first Saturday in June; see “Checking Out Florida’s
Calendar of Events” in Chapter 2) attracts thousands.
Speaking of Gay Days, you can get information about those events as well
as events that occur throughout the year from Gay, Lesbian & Bisexual
Community Center of Central Florida, 934 N. Mills Ave., Orlando, FL 32803
(% 407-228-8272; www.glbcc.org). Welcome packets usually include
the latest issue of Triangle, dedicated to gay and lesbian issues, and a
calendar of events pertaining to Florida’s gay and lesbian community.
The welcome packet includes information and ads for the area’s clubs. 
For state-specific information on the Web, try The Gay Guide to Florida
at http://gay-guide.com, which this has a wealth of information,
especially nightlife listings.
The International Gay and Lesbian Travel Association (IGLTA) (% 800-
448-8550 or 954-776-2626; www.iglta.org) is the trade association for
the gay and lesbian travel industry and offers an online directory of gay-
and lesbian-friendly travel businesses; go to their Web site and click on
“Members.”

Playing It Safe with Travel 
and Medical Insurance
Three kinds of travel insurance are available: trip-cancellation insurance,
medical insurance, and lost luggage insurance. The cost of travel insurance
varies widely, depending on the cost and length of your trip, your age
and health, and the type of trip you’re taking, but expect to pay between
5 and 8 percent of the vacation itself. Here is my advice on all three:
 Trip-cancellation insurance helps you get your money back if you
have to back out of a trip, if you have to go home early, or if your
travel supplier goes bankrupt. Allowed reasons for cancellation can
range from sickness to natural disasters to the State Department
declaring your destination unsafe for travel. (Insurers usually won’t
cover vague fears, though, as many travelers discovered who tried to
cancel their trips in October 2001 because they were wary of flying.)

A good resource is “Travel Guard Alerts,” a list of companies 
considered high-risk by Travel Guard International (www.travel
insured.com). Protect yourself further by paying for the insurance
with a credit card — by law, consumers can get their money back
on goods and services not received if they report the loss within
60 days after the charge is listed on their credit card statement. 
Note: Many tour operators can arrange insurance policies through
a partnering provider, a convenient and often cost-effective way for
the traveler to obtain insurance. Make sure the tour company is a
reputable one, however: Some experts suggest you avoid buying
insurance from the tour or cruise company you’re traveling with,
saying it’s better to buy from a “third party” insurer than to put all
your money in one place.
 For domestic travel, buying medical insurance for your trip doesn’t
make sense for most travelers. Most existing health policies cover
you if you get sick away from home — but check before you go,
particularly if you’re insured by an HMO.
 Lost luggage insurance is not necessary for most travelers. On
domestic flights, checked baggage is covered up to $2,500 per tick-
eted passenger. If you plan to check items more valuable than the
standard liability, see if your valuables are covered by your home-
owner’s policy, get baggage insurance as part of your comprehensive
travel-insurance package or buy Travel Guard’s “BagTrak” product.
Don’t buy insurance at the airport, as it’s usually overpriced. Be
sure to take any valuables or irreplaceable items with you in your
carry-on luggage, as many valuables (including books, money, and
electronics) aren’t covered by airline policies. 
If your luggage is lost, immediately file a lost-luggage claim at the
airport, detailing the luggage contents. For most airlines, you must
report delayed, damaged, or lost baggage within four hours of arrival.
The airlines are required to deliver luggage, once found, directly to
your house or destination free of charge.
For more information, contact one of the following recommended 
insurers: Access America (% 866-807-3982; www.accessamerica.com);
Travel Guard International (% 800-826-4919; www.travelguard.com);
Travel Insured International (% 800-243-3174; www.travelinsured.
com); and Travelex Insurance Services (% 888-457-4602; www.travelex-
insurance.com).
Staying Healthy When You Travel 
Getting sick will ruin your vacation, so I strongly advise against it (of
course, last time I checked, the bugs weren’t listening to me any more
than they probably listen to you). 
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Florida 
72

For domestic trips, most reliable health-care plans provide coverage if
you get sick away from home. For information on purchasing additional
medical insurance for your trip, see the previous section. 
Talk to your doctor before leaving on a trip if you have a serious and/
or chronic illness. For conditions such as epilepsy, diabetes, or heart
problems, wear a MedicAlert identification tag (% 888-633-4298;
www.medicalert.org), which immediately alerts doctors to your 
condition and gives them access to your records through Medic Alert’s
24-hour hotline. 
Keeping Up with Airline Security Measures
With the federalization of airport security, security procedures at U.S.
airports are more stable and consistent than ever. Generally, you’ll be
fine if you arrive at the airport one hour before a domestic flight and
two hours before an international flight; if you show up late, tell an air-
line employee and she’ll probably whisk you to the front of the line.
Bring a current, government-issued photo ID such as a driver’s license
or passport. Keep your ID at the ready to show at check-in, the security
checkpoint, and sometimes even the gate. (Children under 18 do not
need government-issued photo IDs for domestic flights, but they do for
international flights to most countries.) 
In 2003, the TSA phased out gate check-in at all U.S. airports. And e-tickets
have made paper tickets nearly obsolete. Passengers with e-tickets can
beat the ticket-counter lines by using airport electronic kiosks or even
online check-in from your home computer. Online check-in involves 
logging on to your airlines’ Web site, accessing your reservation, and
printing out your boarding pass — and the airline may even offer you
bonus miles to do so! If you’re using a kiosk at the airport, bring the credit
card you used to book the ticket or your frequent-flier card. Print out
your boarding pass from the kiosk and simply proceed to the security
checkpoint with your pass and a photo ID. If you’re checking bags or
looking to snag an exit-row seat, you will be able to do so using most 
airline kiosks. Even the smaller airlines are employing the kiosk system,
but always call your airline to make sure these alternatives are available.
Curbside check-in is also a good way to avoid lines, although a few air-
lines still ban curbside check-in; call before you go.
Security checkpoint lines are getting shorter, but some doozies remain.
If you have trouble standing for long periods of time, tell an airline
employee; the airline will provide a wheelchair. Speed up security by not
wearing metal objects such as big belt buckles. If you’ve got metallic body
parts, a note from your doctor can prevent a long chat with the security
screeners. Keep in mind that only ticketed passengers are allowed past
security, except for folks escorting disabled passengers or children.
Chapter 8: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 73

Federalization has stabilized what you can carry on and what you can’t.
The general rule is that sharp things are out, nail clippers are okay, and
food and beverages must be passed through the X-ray machine — but that
security screeners can’t make you drink from your coffee cup. Bring food
in your carryon, rather than checking it, as explosive-detection machines
used on checked luggage have been known to mistake food (especially
chocolate, for some reason) for bombs. Travelers in the U.S. are allowed
one carry-on bag, plus a “personal item” such as a purse, briefcase, or
laptop bag. Carry-on hoarders can stuff all sorts of things into a laptop
bag; as long as it has a laptop in it, it’s still considered a personal item.
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has issued a list of
restricted items; check its Web site (www.tsa.gov/public/index.jsp)
for details. 
Airport screeners may decide that your checked luggage needs to be
searched by hand. You can now purchase luggage locks that allow screen-
ers to open and relock a checked bag if hand-searching is necessary.
Look for Travel Sentry certified locks at luggage or travel shops and
Brookstone stores (you can buy them online at www.brookstone.com).
These locks, approved by the TSA, can be opened by luggage inspectors
with a special code or key. For more information on the locks, visit www.
travelsentry.org. If you use something other than TSA-approved locks,
your lock will be cut off your suitcase if a TSA agent needs to hand-search
your luggage.
Beating the Crowd: Reservations and Tickets
You’ll want to spend your time in Florida on the beach or at attractions,
not waiting hours for a restaurant table or a theater ticket. Although,
in most cases, an advance reservation (for dining and other activities)
is not mandatory, having one helps your day run smoothly.
Reserving a table
Getting a restaurant reservation in Florida is comparatively easy. In most
cases, you can make same-day reservations or even walk into the restau-
rant when you feel your first hunger pangs. There are, of course, plenty
of exceptions, such as Emeril’s in CityWalk in Orlando (see Chapter 17)
or many of the restaurants on Miami’s South Beach (see Chapter 9). Even
at places that are less in demand, I recommend that you make reserva-
tions as far in advance as you can (including before you leave home) for
any restaurant accepting them. You can find all the information you need
to make a reservation in the dining listings in the destination chapters.
After you arrive, your hotel’s concierge or front desk can help with reser-
vations, too.
If you’re a smoker, don’t plan on lighting up over dinner. Smoking is 
prohibited in Florida’s public work places, including restaurants and
bars that serve food. Stand-alone bars that serve virtually no food are
exempt, as are designated smoking rooms in hotels and motels.

74

Reserving a ticket and getting event information
Ticketmaster is the key player for reservations to most of Florida’s
major events, including concerts, shows, and pro sports events. If you
know of an event that happens while you’re in town, check first with
your hometown Ticketmaster outlets to see if they sell tickets for the
event. (If you live as close as Atlanta or New Orleans, they probably do.)
Otherwise, go to the Ticketmaster Web site at www.ticketmaster.com,
or call the outlet in the city you’ll be visiting. The Ticketmaster numbers
for a few of Florida’s larger cities are:
 Fort Lauderdale: % 954-523-3309
 North Florida: % 904-353-3309
 Miami: % 305-358-5885
 Orlando: % 407-839-3900
 St. Petersburg: % 727-898-2100
 Tampa: % 813-287-8844
Most of the ticket outlets are open from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., Monday through
Friday, and 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., Saturday and Sunday.
You can pick up information on what’s playing in your part of Florida
from a few solid sources. Most of Florida’s midsize and larger daily news-
papers publish an entertainment section on Friday that includes events,
restaurants, and more. Many of them have free online publications.
The International Association of Convention and Visitor Bureaus has
a Web site at www.officialtravelinfo.com — another good place to
find out what’s happening during your stay. Use the site’s links page
to find your destination, and then choose the services or activities you
want to see. The same goes for Visit Florida (% 888-735-2872; Internet:
www.flausa.com) and Absolutely Florida (% 305-865-9420; Internet:
www.funandsun.com), which include information on sightseeing, cultural
events, accommodations, and more.
The visitor centers listed in the destination chapters are also good
sources of event, restaurant, and sightseeing information.
Reserving a green
Golfers can get information on many of Florida’s courses and make
reservations through Golfpac (% 800-327-0878 or 407-260-2288;
www.golfpacinc.com). Or you can contact Tee Times USA by calling

South Florida

In this part . . .
You may already be zeroing in on South Florida as your
top-draft pick. Arguably, it has as much diversity as any
other landing zone in Florida. Party people ﬁnd it hard to resist
the glam-iﬁed energy of Miami’s South Beach (see Chapters 9
and 10) or the eclectic, laid-back lifestyle of Key West (see
Chapter 11). And if you prefer to relax when vacationing, you
aren’t left out, thanks to such natural treasures as John
Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park in Key Largo (Chapter 11),
Bahia Honda State Park on Big Pine Key (Chapter 11), and the
Everglades (Chapter 12).
The following ﬁve chapters offer all you need to know about
the best places to eat, sleep, and be merry in the frequently
frenetic, though sometimes soothing, south.

f you think Miami is all palm trees and little substance, you’re wrong.
Miami is one of the few cities that actually benefits from multiple-
personality disorder. Biscayne Bay ripples in the sunset as the last
speedboats come home for the night. Little Havana provides a glimpse
of pre-Castro Cuba juxtaposed by the Mc-pleasures of modern life. And
the alluring sands of South Beach glitter with glitz, glam, and all the 
makings of a juicy gossip column. This is as chic as La Florida gets, where
La Dolce Vita fuses with La Vida Loca, creating a tropical cocktail that’s
guaranteed to both shake and stir. With the exception of theme parks
and Mouse-ka-things, you can find just about everything worth finding
in Florida in Miami.
First-time visitors are most surprised by the city’s cultural and natural
resources. Sapphire-blue water, gleaming quartz beaches, and tropical
gardens are complemented by such standouts as Villa Vizcaya, Biscayne
National Park, and Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Recreation Area. And
yes, if you need an attraction fix, some of Florida’s most enduring — among
them, the Miami Seaquarium and Metrozoo — are here to prove that
animal life does exist beyond the maniacal drivers on I-95.
I’ll chauffeur you to those as well as to other attractions in Chapter 10,
but for now I get you here, through the check-in line, and parked at a
dinner table.
Getting There
Most folks come by air because flying is convenient and in most cases
reasonably economical. Trains can be tedious, and even rail buffs find
them time-consuming if they only have a week off. Ditto for drivers —
they’re staring at about 450 miles between the state line and Miami.

By plane
Touch down at Miami International Airport (MIA), which handles 34
million passengers annually. The tenth busiest airport in the world, it’s
served by more than 100 domestic and foreign airlines, offering direct
links to 200 cities on five continents. The airport’s 121 gates may seem
overwhelming, but the layout isn’t quite as complicated as it appears.
For further information, call % 305-876-7000, or visit the airport’s
Web site (www.miami-airport.com).
After picking up your luggage — the route to baggage claim is clearly
marked — you can take advantage of a number of services:
 Car-rental desks for Avis, Budget, Dollar, Hertz, National, Value, and
Royal are on the first level near the baggage-claim exit. (See the
Appendix for rental-car agency information.)
 Customs has two inspection areas. Passengers arriving at Con-
courses D, E, and F exit at Concourse E, Level 1. Those arriving
at Concourses A and B exit at Concourse B, Level 3.
 Foreign currency exchange booths are at six locations on Level 2
and on Level 3 in the Greeter’s Lobby Concourse B. A booth at
Concourse E operates 24 hours a day. If you’re coming from another
country, convert to U.S. dollars at a bank back home. The exchange
rate may not be better, but you’ll save on fees.
 The 24-hour information center is on Level 2, at Concourse E across
from the hotel. There are four other centers, including two at bag-
gage claim on Level 1, Concourses D and G (open 11 a.m.–7 p.m.).
You can also get information by calling % 305-876-7000.
 A full-service bank is located on Level 4 of Concourse B. ATMs are
also located at the Passenger Service Centers between Concourses
B and C and between Concourses G and H on Level 2 of the Terminal.
The bank is open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays and from 10 a.m.
to 4 p.m. on Saturdays.
Interstate 95, toll roads, and interior highways link Miami International
Airport, 6 miles from downtown Miami and about 10 miles from the
beaches, to the tourist areas. As I mentioned earlier, all the major car-
rental agencies are located at the airport, or they run shuttles to their
nearby offices. If you reserved your rental car before you left home,
head for the rental agency’s desk after you’ve collected your baggage.
Cabs cost from $1.50 to $3 to start the meter and $2 for each mile. So a
one-way fare for up to five people from the airport to the beaches would
range from $24 and up. Cab rides from the airport are blissfully short: To
South Beach, it’s only about 15 minutes; downtown is less; Coral Gables
and the South, about 20 minutes, which is the same for the North Miami
area. Taxis line up outside the airport’s arrival terminals. SuperShuttle is
one of the city’s busiest van services. Its rates from the airport to South
Part III: South Florida 
80

Beach are $13 per person one-way. That’s not a bargain for larger families.
Be prepared to make several stops because you’re likely to share a ride
with several strangers. For more information, call % 305-871-2000, or
visit the shuttle’s Web site (www.supershuttle.com).
I don’t recommend using public buses. They’re unreliable and brutally
slow, taking an hour or more to travel the 10 miles to South Beach.
If you are headed to the northern section of Miami you may be better off
flying in and out of Fort Lauderdale Hollywood International Airport
(% 954-359-6100; www.co.broward.fl.us/fll.htm). Oftentimes, flights
routed through this airport are cheaper than those flying into and out of
MIA. Located in the middle of Broward County, it’s actually closer to North
Miami Beach and Aventura than Miami’s own airport. See Chapter 13 for
more on this airport.
By car
If you’re coming by car, there are only two routes worth considering:
 Connect with Interstate 75 in north Florida and the Florida
Turnpike (a toll road) at Wildwood.
 Ride Interstate 95 down the East Coast.
I-95 is the major north–south artery here. From it, you can reach the
beaches, downtown, and points south. But it’s the highway system’s
answer to bronchitis — highly congested — and poorly marked, so it’s
easy to get lost. (See Chapter 4 for northerly routes into the city.)
By train
Amtrak (% 800-872-7245; www.amtrak.com) has two trains departing
daily from New York. That’s the good news. The bad news: They take as
long as 30 hours to reach Miami, and prices often aren’t much cheaper
than airfare (and they’re worse if you want a sleeper). See Chapter 4
for additional information on train travel in Florida, including Amtrak’s
Auto Train. 
Orienting Yourself in Miami
Most of western Miami-Dade County is undeveloped, but areas east of 
I-75 — especially the coastal zone — are so saturated that the county
has had to go to ten-digit dialing for local calls. (That means you need to
dial the 305 or 786 area code followed by the seven-digit local number.)
Miami’s modest herd of high-rises lies in the heart of the city, and you
can see them from a wide radius, making them a good reference point.
The airport is west; the beaches are east; Coconut Grove and the Keys
are south.
Chapter 9: Settling into Miami 81

The mainland — some parts of Miami lie on islands, which are connected
to the mainland by causeways — is cut into quadrants: Northeast,
Northwest, Southeast, and Southwest. The quadrants converge at the
intersection of Flagler Street and Miami Avenue. Street numbering, in
most cases, is reasonably simple. Leaving that intersection, you progress
through First Street, Second Street, Third Street, and so on. A NE, NW, SE,
or SW designation following the street number tells you which quadrant
you’re in. The same holds true for avenues, boulevards, terraces, places,
and lanes. Also note that most streets run east–west, while avenues run
north–south.
Miami Beach’s layout is simpler. First Street is on its southern tip, and the
street numbers progress north. Collins Avenue, alias A1A, runs north–
south the length of the island. As on the mainland, it’s one of several
thoroughfares that has more than one name or number. (If cases like this
come up in hotel or attractions listings, I’ll give you both names and/or
numbers.)
One other point: Numbers on the mainland and island do not match up
with each other. For instance, the 79th Street Causeway coming from the
mainland reaches across Biscayne Bay to 71st Street on the beach.
Introducing the neighborhoods
Miami-Dade County is a huge area that includes Miami, Miami Beach,
Coconut Grove, Coral Gables, Aventura, Hialeah, and a number of other
cities. (Skip ahead to the “Miami at a Glance” map.) The sprawling metrop-
olis is confusing at best for those who’ve never set foot in Miami and
almost as baffling for those who’ve been here before. The street signs
include both names and numbers to help you find your way, but they
don’t always lead you in a straight line because Miami is full of canals,
causeways, parks, and other obstacles. Getting lost here is easier than
acquiring a suntan on the beach.
We’ve broken the county into eight geographical regions that should
help you navigate, or at least identify where you are when your trip to
the beach somehow lands you in a swamp.
Coconut Grove
The Grove used to be quite groovy, a haven for hippies, intellectuals,
and artists. Today, it’s an enclave of Americana with stores like the Gap
and Banana Republic. In addition to chain stores, the neighborhood’s
major streets — Grand Avenue, Main Highway, and McFarlane Road —
boast theme restaurants, and a casual, mostly collegiate crowd that
makes for some rowdy behavior, especially at night. The architecture here
is schizophrenic — a cross between old-world Bahamian and prefabbed
Mediterranean. Past all the stores and elements of commercialism, you’ll
find Bahamian-style frame homes along Charles Street built by early set-
tlers from the Islands. The Coconut Grove Goombay Festival (in early
June), a street party, celebrates that island heritage.

Miami at a Glance
Don’t stray far from the major tourist strips in this neighborhood at night.
Coral Gables
“The City Beautiful,” created by George Merrick in the early 1920s, is one
of Miami’s first planned developments in which even the newspaper boxes
have to conform to certain standards of beauty. This is not Levittown:
The houses here were built in a Mediterranean style along lush tree-lined
streets that open onto beautifully carved plazas, many with centerpiece
fountains. The best architectural examples of the era have Spanish-style
tiled roofs and are built from Miami oolite, a native limestone commonly

called “coral rock.” Once sleepy and outdated, Miracle Mile is a block in
downtown Coral Gables that is undergoing a slow renaissance. It offers
pricey furniture stores, cafes, wedding dress stores, and boutiques. Coral
Gables also has landmark hotels, great golfing, upscale shopping, and
some of the city’s best restaurants.
Downtown Miami
Miami’s downtown boasts one of the world’s most beautiful cityscapes.
Unfortunately, that’s about all it offers. During the day, a vibrant commu-
nity of students, businesspeople, and merchants make their way through
the bustling streets. Vendors sell fresh-cut pineapples and mangos while
young consumers on shopping sprees lug bags and boxes. However, at
night, downtown is desolate (except for the burgeoning nightlife scene —
only on NE 11th Street at the moment) and not a place in which you’d want
to get lost. The downtown area does have a mall (Bayside Marketplace,
where many cruise passengers come to browse), some culture (Metro-
Dade Cultural Center), and a few decent restaurants, as well as the
American Airlines Arena. An exclusive residential and commercial 
offshoot of Brickell Avenue, Brickell Key is accessible by bridge and
perched pristinely on Biscayne Bay overlooking the magnificent city 
skyline. Additionally, a downtown revitalization project is in the works,
in which a cultural arts center, among other things, is expected to bring
downtown back to life and less reminiscent of the chapter in Bonfire of
the Vanitie, in which taking a wrong turn in the wrong part of town was a
big mistake.
This neighborhood is not the kind of place safety-conscious people hang
around after dark.
Design District
With restaurants springing up between galleries, and furniture stores
galore, the Design District is, as locals say, the new South Beach, adding
a touch of New York’s SoHo to an area formerly known as downtown
Miami’s “Don’t Go.” The district, which is a hotbed for furniture-import
companies, interior designers, architects, and more, has also become a
player in Miami’s ever-changing nightlife, with rotating gallery parties
that have become hipster central for South Beach expatriates and artsy
bohemian types. In anticipation of its growing popularity, the district
has also banded together to create an up-to-date Web site, www.design
miami.com, which includes a calendar of events and is full of information.
The district is loosely defined as the area bounded by NE Second Avenue,
NE Fifth Avenue East and West, and NW 36th Street to the South.
Biscayne Corridor
From downtown near Bayside to the 70s, where trendy curio shops and
upscale restaurants are slowly opening, Biscayne Boulevard is aspiring
to reclaim itself as a safe thoroughfare where tourists can wine, dine,
and shop. Previously known for sketchy, dilapidated 1950s- and ’60s-era
hotels that had fallen on hard times, residents fleeing the high prices of
Part III: South Florida 
84

the beaches in search of affordable housing are renovating Biscayne block
by block, trying to make this once-again-famous boulevard worthy of a
Sunday drive. With the trendy Design District immediately west of 36th
and Biscayne by two blocks, there is hope for the area.
Greater Miami
This zone encompasses everything from North Miami Beach to a large
hunk of Everglades National Park, Biscayne National Park, and the
Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Although many of these are
pristine areas, towns such as Hialeah, Miami Springs, and Homestead
tend to be congested with condos and shopping malls. None are partic-
ularly visitor-oriented, though I make a few stops here later on in this
chapter and the next.
Key Biscayne
Locals call it the Key, and technically, Key Biscayne is the northernmost
island in the Florida Keys even though it is located in Miami. Situated
south of Miami Beach, off the shores of Coconut Grove, Key Biscayne is
protected from the troubles of the mainland by the long Rickenbacker
Causeway and its $1 toll. Largely an exclusive residential community,
with million-dollar homes and sweeping water views, Key Biscayne also
offers visitors great public beaches, some top (read: pricey) resort hotels,
and several good restaurants. 
Little Havana
If you’ve never been to Cuba, just visit this small section of Miami and
you’ll come pretty close. The sounds, tastes, and rhythms are very remi-
niscent of Cuba’s capital city. Some even jokingly say you don’t have to
speak a word of English to live an independent life here — even street
signs are in Spanish and English. Cuban coffee shops, tailor and furniture
stores, and inexpensive restaurants line Calle Ocho (pronounced Ka-yey
O-choh), SW Eighth Street, the region’s main thoroughfare. Salsa and
merengue beats ring loudly from old record stores while old men in
guayaberas (loose shirts) smoke cigars over their daily game of dominoes.
The spotlight focused on the neighborhood during the Elian Gonzalez
situation in 2000, but the area was previously noted for the groups of
artists and nocturnal types who have moved their galleries and perform-
ance spaces here, sparking a culturally charged neobohemian nightlife.
As much as I love it, this is another area you’d best leave when the
sun does.
Miami Beach
In the fabulous ’50s, Miami Beach was America’s true Riviera. The stomp-
ing ground of choice for celebrities such as Frank Sinatra and the Rat
Pack, as well as notorious mobsters (Al Capone was a one-time habitué),
its huge self-contained resort hotels were vacations unto themselves,
providing a full day’s worth of meals, activities, and entertainment. Then,
Chapter 9: Settling into Miami 85

in the 1960s and 1970s, people who fell in love with Miami began to buy
apartments rather than rent hotel rooms. Tourism declined, the Rat Pack
and Sopranos types decamped to Vegas, and many area hotels fell into
disrepair. However, since the late 1980s and South Beach’s renaissance,
Miami Beach (24th Street and up) has experienced a tide of revitaliza-
tion. Beach hotels are finding their niche with new international tourist
markets and are attracting large convention crowds. New generations of
Americans are discovering the qualities that originally made Miami Beach
so popular, and they’re finding out that the sand and surf now come with
a thriving international city.
North Miami Beach and Aventura
A residential area, North Miami Beach has shopping and dining, but it’s
not much of a tourist stop. Aventura Mall is the area’s biggest attraction,
with an impressive selection of boutique, department, and chain stores
located within the mostly residential, upscale NMB enclave of Aventura.
Unlike its southern cousin, North Miami Beach is on the mainland.
South Beach: The Art Deco District
Though many monikers are used to describe Miami’s publicity darling —
Glitter Beach, SoBe, America’s Riviera, Hollywood South, Manhattan
South — South Beach is a uniquely surreal, Dalí-esque cocktail of cos-
mopolitan influences with a splash of saltwater thrown in to remind you
that you’re not in a concrete jungle anymore. South Beach’s 10 miles of
beach are alive with a frenetic, circuslike atmosphere and are center
stage for a motley crew of characters, from eccentric locals, senior citi-
zens, snowbirds, and college students to gender benders, celebrities,
club kids, and curiosity-seekers. Individuality is as widely accepted on
South Beach as Visa and MasterCard. Bolstered by a Caribbean-chic cafe
society and a sexually charged, hip nightlife, people watching on South
Beach (from 1st to 23rd streets) is almost as good as a front-row seat at
a Milan fashion show. Sure, the beautiful people do flock here, but the
models aren’t the only sights worth drooling over. The thriving Art Deco
District within South Beach contains the largest remaining concentration
of 1930s architecture in the world. In 1979, much of South Beach was
listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The pastel-hued struc-
tures are supermodels in their own right — only these models improve
with age.
Finding information after you arrive
I urge you to plan in advance. Contact the visitor-information folks listed
here and in the Appendix. 
The Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau, 701 Brickell Ave.,
Suite 2700, Miami, FL 33131 (% 800-933-8448 or 305-539-3063; www.
tropicoolmiami.com), is the best source of information about Miami.
Part III: South Florida 
86

Even if you don’t have a specific question, call ahead to request its free
vacation planner, TropiCool Miami, which includes easy-to-use maps
and useful contact numbers. The office is open weekdays from 9 a.m.
to 5 p.m.
The local chambers of commerce also offer good information. The Greater
Miami Chamber of Commerce, 420 Lincoln Rd., no. 20, Miami Beach, FL
33139 (% 305-350-7700; www.greatermiami.com) can provide a neigh-
borhood map and tourist information, as can the Coral Gables Chamber
of Commerce, 50 Aragon Ave., Coral Gables, FL 33134 (% 305-446-1657;
www.gableschamber.org), and Coconut Grove Chamber of Commerce,
2820 McFarlane Rd., Miami, FL 33133 (% 305-444-7270).
If you’re hooked into the Internet, surf over to www.miami.com. It provides
a vast array of information on accommodations, dining, and entertain-
ment options throughout Miami and South Florida. You can also check
out Miami-Dade County’s official Web site at www.co.miami-dade.fl.us,
which offers up-to-date information on county parks, sports, and attrac-
tions, such as the Miami Metrozoo, and cultural events. The Miami
Design Preservation League, 1234 Washington Ave., Suite 207, Miami
Beach (% 305-672-2014), has an informative guide on South Beach’s Art
Deco District. It’s open from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., Monday through Saturday.
The Greater Miami and the Beaches Hotel Association, 407 Lincoln Rd.,
Miami Beach (% 800-531-3553 or 305-531-3553) has information about
accommodations and tours.
Getting around Miami
A car is your best option for getting around the city, as long as you have
a reliable map (see the “Fast Facts” in Chapter 10). Taxis are a distant
second — economical only if you’re in a group of four or five people.
Public transportation is plodding, and, except for South Beach and the
shopping and dining meccas of Coconut Grove and Coral Gables, Miami
isn’t much of a walker’s paradise.
By car
Most streets on the mainland and beaches are numbered, so finding your
way around is fairly easy if you have a reliable map. (You can get one from
one of the information sources listed under “Fast Facts” in Chapter 10,
from AAA if you’re a member, or from your car-rental agency.) Miami’s
attractions, beaches, restaurants, and hotels are spread out, making a car
almost essential if you want to explore in a timely, cost-effective manner.
If, on the other hand, you plan to camp at a resort or on South Beach and
do your sightseeing by guided tour, you won’t need a car. (Don’t forget to
allow time in your schedule for delays caused by traffic congestion and,
if you’re going to or from the beaches, drawbridge openings.)
Chapter 9: Settling into Miami 87

Generally, there are plenty of parking spaces throughout Miami-Dade
County (a major exception is South Beach), but parking can be expensive.
Keep your pocket or wallet filled with quarters to feed the hungry meters
or be prepared for fines of $20 or more. You can find parking garages and
valet service in some areas. The going rate for valet parking at restaurants
and hotels is $3 to $20 depending on how much they think you need them.
(If you’re in South Beach and don’t mind losing a little shoe leather, there
are parking garages at 17th Street and Washington Avenue, Seventh Street
between Washington and Collins avenues, and 13th Street between Collins
Avenue and Ocean Drive. The cost is $1 an hour or $8 a day.)
See the Appendix for contact information about rental-car agencies.
By taxi
Unless you can fill the cab (five passengers), this isn’t a cheap way to
travel, especially when you add a tip. However, a taxi is usually quick
and direct, with fixed rates between certain points. Usually it’s $1.50 to
start the meter and $2 for each mile. The county’s main cab companies
are Central (% 305-532-5555), Metro (% 305-888-8888), and Yellow
(% 305-444-4444).
By bus
Miami’s public transit system offers little to recommend it. Bus routes
almost universally are designed for commuters, not visitors. Even if buses
go your way, they’re slow, making too many stops and often requiring
transfers and more time. For the record, the Metro-Dade Transit System
(% 305-770-3131; www.co.miami-dade.fl.us/transit) operates the
county’s bus line. Fares are $1.25 plus 25¢ for each transfer.
By rail
The Metro-Dade Transit System (% 305-770-3131; www.co.miami-dade.
fl.us/transit) also operates two trains in the county. Metrorail, the
city’s modern high-speed commuter train, is a 21-mile elevated line that
travels north–south between downtown Miami and the southern suburbs.
Locals like to refer to this semiuseless rail system as Metrofail. If you’re
staying in Coral Gables or Coconut Grove, you can park your car at a
nearby station and ride the rails downtown. However, that’s about it. There
are plans to extend the system to service Miami International Airport, but
until those tracks are built, these trains don’t go most places tourists go,
with the exception of Vizcaya in Coconut Grove. Metrorail operates daily
from about 6 a.m. to midnight. The fare is $1.25. Metromover, a 4.4-mile
elevated line, circles the downtown area and connects with Metrorail
at the Government Center stop. This is a good way to get to Bayside (a
waterfront marketplace, see Chapter 10) if you don’t have a car. Riding
on rubber tires, the single-car train winds past many of the area’s most
important attractions and shopping and business districts. You may not
go very far, but you’ll get a beautiful perspective from the towering height
of the suspended rails. System hours are daily from about 6 a.m. to mid-
night. The fare is 25¢.
Part III: South Florida 
88

Staying in Style
The following listings reflect the city’s best choices in various price cate-
gories. In general, you can expect to pay the highest prices for the more
upscale digs, as well as those in or near the beaches. 
Note that although rates in this chapter are per-night double occupancy,
this is a kid-friendly state. Many accommodations let kids under 12 and
in some cases under 18 stay free with parents or grandparents as long as
you don’t exceed the maximum occupancy of the room. Just to be safe,
ask when booking your room.
The height of tourist season — the priciest period — is winter. Rates will
be highest from November through March. The off season is generally
considered to run from mid-May through August, and rates are discounted
by as much as 30 to 50 percent. If you’re a beach buff, you can also save
by staying at a hotel a few blocks off the water.
If you don’t like dealing directly with hotels or haggling over rates, you
can contact several reservations services in the area, including Central
Reservation Service (% 800-555-7555; www.reservation-services.
com), Florida Hotel Network (% 800-538-3616; www.floridahotels.
com), and the Greater Miami and The Beaches Hotel Association
(% 800-733-6426; www.gmbha.org).
Don’t forget to allow for taxes. The combined sales, local option, and
hotel bed taxes can add as much as 12.5 percent to your bill.
One last note: This is Florida. That means every hotel listed here has air-
conditioning and either has a pool or is on the ocean. These hotels also
have television (most have cable and many have in-room movies) and
telephones. Many also have hair dryers, coffeemakers, and in-room safes.
Miami’s best hotels
The Biltmore Hotel
$$$$
Coral Gables
Old-world glamour and rich history permeate the Biltmore as much as the
pricey perfume of the guests who stay here. Built in 1926, it’s the oldest
Coral Gables hotel and a National Historical Landmark — one of only two
operating hotels in Florida to receive that designation. Rising above the
Spanish-style estate is a majestic 300-foot, copper-clad tower, modeled
after the Giralda bell tower in Seville and visible throughout the city. Over
the years, the Biltmore has passed through many incarnations (including
a post–World War II stint as a VA hospital), but it’s now back to its original
splendor. More intriguing than scary is the rumor that ghosts of wounded
soldiers and even Al Capone, for whom the Everglades Suite is nicknamed,
roam the halls here. But don’t worry. The hotel is far from a haunted
house. It’s warm, welcoming, and extremely charming. Always a popular

South Beach Accommodations

destination for golfers, including former President Clinton (who stays in
the Al Capone suite), the Biltmore is situated on a lush, rolling 18-hole
course that is as challenging as it is beautiful. The spa is fantastic, and the
enormous winding pool is legendary — it’s where a pre-Tarzan Johnny
Weissmuller broke the world’s swimming record.

The Creek
$
South Beach
This funky and arty hostel-like hotel, formerly known as the Banana
Bungalow, is cheap, campy, and quintessentially Miami Beach. Popular
with the MTV set, The Creek is a redone 1950s two-story motel that’s
loaded with amenities and where it’s always spring break. There are three
types of rooms: The Waterway Standard, no frills rooms which face a
narrow canal where motorboats and kayaks are available for a small
charge; the noisier Cabana Room, which opens to the pool deck (which
boasts a serious sound system that the hotel turns off around midnight);
and the Signature Rooms, 18 “altered living spaces” designed by artists and
on the second floor facing the pool deck. I highly recommend the Signature
Rooms that are facing the Intracoastal Waterway in terms of decor and pri-
vacy, something you won’t have if you face out onto the buzzing pool deck.
Shared rooms are available for the uber budget conscious.

David William Hotel
$$–$$$$
Coral Gables
At this sister hotel to the Biltmore, you get many of the same amenities for
a lower price. Guests can even take a shuttle to the Biltmore to play a
round of golf, enjoy the health club and spa, play tennis, or take a dip in
the pool. The luxurious one- and two-bedroom suites are extremely spa-
cious and have eat-in kitchens for extended stays. For a spectacular view
of Miami, go up to the roof and have a drink by the pool. The hotel, which
has undergone a recent exterior renovation, is directly across the street
from the Granada Golf Course, less than 5 miles from the airport, and only
20 minutes from Miami Beach. Carmen The Restaurant, the culinary brain-
child of chef Carmen Gonzalez, features Post-New-American Cuisine, a sexy
spin on New American Cuisine steeped in exotic Hispanic/Latino influ-
ences. If you want luxury without the price, this is your best alternative in
the Gables.

The Delano
$$$$
South Beach
Today, the Delano, a place where smiles from staffers were once as rare as
snow in Miami, is kinder and gentler to its guests (with an emphasis on B-
and C-list celebrities and tourists not entirely in tune with the times), which
for some, takes away the whole caché of staying here. But it certainly still
is amusing to look at — with 40-foot, sheer, white, billowing curtains hang-
ing outside, mirrors everywhere, Adirondack chairs, and faux fur–covered
beds. The rooms are done up sanitarium style: sterile, yet terribly trendy,
in pure white save for a perfectly crisp, green Granny Smith apple in each
room — the only freebie you’re going to get here. A bathroom renovation
recently took place in all the rooms — but they remain small and spartan.

Fontainebleau Hilton Resort
$$$–$$$$
Miami Beach
In many ways, this is the quintessential Miami Beach hotel. Designed by
Morris Lapidus, who oversaw an expansion in 2000, this grand monolith
symbolizes Miami decadence. Since its opening in 1954, the Fontainebleau
has hosted presidents, pageants, and movie productions, including the
James Bond thriller Goldfinger. This is where all the greats, including Sinatra
and his pals, performed in their prime. Club Tropigala is reminiscent of Ricky
Ricardo’s Tropicana and features a Las Vegas–style floor show with dozens
of performers and two orchestras. Rooms are luxurious and decorated in
various styles from 1950s to ultramodern; bathrooms are done up in Italian
marble. In 2001, the hotel underwent a $10 million renovation of its restau-
rants, introducing the massive, cruiseship-esque, 150-seat Bleu View
Mediterranean restaurant and cocktail lounge. Meanwhile, the 7,000-square-
foot Cookie’s World water park brings a bit of Disney to Deco-land, complete
with a water slide and river-raft ride. Along with supervised children’s activ-
ities, the water park is geared to (though not reserved for) the little ones.
The hotel’s size tends to cause problems. The staff is overworked, and
lines in the lobby area are frequently long.

Loews Miami Beach Hotel
$$$
South Beach
The Loews Hotel is one of the largest beach hotels to arrive in South Beach
in almost 30 years, consuming an unprecedented 900 feet of oceanfront.
This 800-room behemoth is considered an eyesore by many, an architec-
tural triumph by others. However you perceive it, you can’t miss the
hotel’s cone-shaped, 18-story tower perched high above the rest of South
Beach. Rooms are a bit boxy and bland — nothing to rave about — but
they’re clean and have new carpets and bedspreads to erase signs of early
wear and tear from the hotel’s heavy traffic. If you can steer your way
through all the name-tagged businesspeople in the lobby, you can escape
to the pool (with an undisputedly gorgeous, landscaped entrance that’s
more Maui than Miami), which is large enough to accommodate families
and conventioneers alike. The Loews Loves Kids program features special
menus, tours, welcome gifts for children under 10, supervised programs,
and free accommodations for children under 18; in addition, the Generation
G program offers perks for grandparents and grandkids traveling together.
Adults can indulge in fun activities such as Dive in Movies at the pool, salsa
lessons, and bingo. In November 2003, star chef Emeril Lagasse opened
Miami’s first-ever Emeril’s restaurant here, making the Loews a bigger focal
point for seeing and being seen than ever before.

Oct–Mar from $229, Apr–Sept from $189. AE, DC, DISC, MC. V.
Mandarin-Oriental
$$$$
Brickell Key/Downtown Miami
The swank Mandarin Oriental is, hands down, the city’s best. The waterfront
view of the city is the hotel’s best asset, but the service isn’t too shabby
either. Much of the hotel’s staff was flown in from Bangkok and Hong Kong
to demonstrate the hotel’s unique brand of superattentive, Asian-inspired
service. The hotel’s two restaurants, the high-end Azul and the more
casual Café Sambal, are up to Mandarin standards and are both wonderful,
as is the 15,000-square-foot spa in which traditional Thai massages and
Ayurvedic treatments are your tickets to nirvana.

Chapter 9: Settling into Miami 93

The Raleigh
$$$–$$$$
South Beach
It’s the Raleigh’s romantic Deco lure that has people skipping over from
the chillier, more sterile Delano a few blocks up for much needed warmth.
Even more an incentive to stay here is the fact that hip hotelier André
Balazs of LA’s Chateau Marmont and Standard hotels fame is the new
owner of the place. And he dates Uma Thurman. Rooms are small, but
cozy, and celeb chef Eric Ripert of NYC’s Le Bernadin is the hotel’s newly
appointed “directeur de cuisine.” Even if you don’t stay here, check out
the legendary pool, where, on Sundays, the who’s who of the chic elite
bask in the fabulous Raleigh glow at a party known as Sunday Soiree.

The Ritz-Carlton, South Beach
$$$$
South Beach
The lushly landscaped Ritz-Carlton has restored the landmark Morris
Lapidus–designed 1950s DiLido Hotel to its original Art Moderne style and
filled it with the hotel’s signature five-star service. Also alluring are an ele-
vated pool that provides unobstructed views of the Altantic, an impressive
stretch of sand with a fabulous beach club run by Michael Capponi, Miami
Beach’s most popular promoter, an oceanfront Ritz Kids pavilion, and a
world-class 13,000-square-foot spa and wellness center.

The Sagamore
$$$–$$$$
South Beach
The Sagamore, quietly fabulous in its own right, with an ultramodern lobby-
cum–art gallery that’s infinitely warmer than your typical pop art exhibit
at the Museum of Modern Art, features all-suite, apartment-like rooms that
are full of all the cushy comforts of home and then some.

South Beach Dining

Dining Out
Despite the plethora of toned, buff-body beautifuls, Miami is a foodie’s
paradise. People really do eat here. In fact, dining out is as much a pas-
time as inline skating on Ocean Drive or seeing and being seen in the clubs.
A dizzying and mouthwatering array of cuisines awaits, from home-cooked
Floribbean and Cuban to froufrou fusion fare. However, competition is so
stiff that some places don’t last three months — don’t be surprised if your
number-one choice on these pages has disappeared by the time you land.
Some great kitchens can’t stand the heat. 
Smokers take note: All Florida restaurants and food-serving bars are
smoke-free.
Keep in mind that you won’t be the only one looking to eat at the hottest
restaurants in town. To save yourself from headaches and an empty
stomach, make reservations at the restaurants you want to sample.
Otherwise, you may end up waiting several hours — and in the best
of the best, several days — for a table.
Miami’s best restaurants
Azul
$$$
Brickell Key/Downtown Miami
GLOBAL FUSION
Azul is a tour de force of international cuisine, inspired by Caribbean,
French, Argentine, Asian, and homegrown American flavors. Although the
restaurant itself is stunning — waterfront views, high ceilings, walls bur-
nished in copper, and silk-covered chairs — the real jewel is the food. The
hamachi carpaccio appetizer sumptuously arranges yellowtail (imported
from Japan), shaved fennel, mixed greens, and cucumber. Entrees, or “Plates
of Resistance” as they’re called here, include braised open-faced ravioli
with langoustine; ginger-lemongrass-glazed Chilean sea bass served with
black rice, kimchi, and Napa cabbage; and chicken with red Thai curry.
Desserts range from fruity to chocolatey and shouldn’t be skipped.
See map p. 104. At the Mandarin Oriental, 500 Brickell Key Dr. % 305-913-8254.
Reservations strongly recommended. To get there: From I-95, take the Brickell
Avenue exit and make a right onto Brickell Avenue, continuing over the bridge until
you reach SE Eighth Street. Make a left and continue over the bridge. Hotel is on the
right. Main courses: $24–$38. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V. Open: Mon–Fri noon–3 p.m.;
Mon–Sat 7–11 p.m.
B.E.D.
$$$$
South Beach
FRENCH FUSION
Beverage, Entertainment, Dining is what B.E.D. stands for, but don’t laugh:
You will literally take your food lying down — sort of — as platform beds
substitute for traditional tables at this nouveau, highly gimmicky haute
spot. When you walk inside, you’ll feel as if you’ve entered a Buddhist
temple. An array of inviting mosquito-netted beds awaits diners. You’ll rest
your head against soft cushiony pillows. A deejay spins Euro mood music

and some techno. You’ll have no problem appreciating the taste and aroma
of the exquisite (and exquisitely priced) cuisine, featuring dishes such as
pan-seared foie gras with caramelized mango and cranberry with French
toast, and Florida Red Snapper with garlic mash, matchstick asparagus (a
fancy way of saying thin asparagus), and a choice of caper beurre noisette
or Vermouth cream sauce. For dessert, try the Ménage à Trois — three sor-
bets including champagne, sour cherry, and mango — or indulge in some
Fire and Ice — molten chocolate cake with rum vanilla ice cream and
caramel sauce. 
See map p. 98. 929 Washington Ave. % 305-532-9070. Reservations required,
accepted only on the day you plan to dine here. Main courses: $32–$40. AE, DC, MC, V.
Open: Wed–Sun: first lay (no actual seats) 8:30 p.m. (opens at 8 p.m.); second lay
10:30 p.m. Lounge 11 p.m.–3 a.m.
Big Fish
$$
Downtown Miami
SEAFOOD
Hard to locate, but well worth the search, Big Fish lures diners with a
sweeping view of the Miami skyline and some of the freshest catch around.
The spectacular setting is also a draw, right on the Miami River where
freighters, fishing boats, dinghies, and sometimes yachts slink by. Originally
a traditional seafood spot, Big Fish added some Italian options to its all-
seafood menu in the hopes of attracting more people, but the pasta is mainly
a starchy diversion. Beware of Friday nights, when Big Fish hooks up with
a big happy-hour scene.
See map p. 104. 55 SW Miami Avenue Rd. % 305-373-1770. To get there: Cross the
Brickell Avenue Bridge heading south and take the first right on SW Fifth Street; the
road narrows under a bridge, and the restaurant is just on the other side. Main
courses: $15–$28. AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Daily 11 a.m.–11 p.m.
Caffé Abbracci
$$
Coral Gables
ITALIAN
Abbracci’s staff serves delightfully prepared food in a fun — if somewhat
loud — setting. The menu changes periodically but may include snapper
grilled with shiitake mushrooms or frutti di mare — an assortment of
seafood — in tomato sauce served over linguine. Try the salmon or tuna
carpaccio for starters. This place gets really packed on weekends.
See map p. 104. 318 Aragon Ave., Aragon at Salzedo. % 305-441-0700. Reservations
required. To get there: Take LeJeune Road/42nd Avenue south from airport, then east on
Aragon. Main courses: $16–$28. AE, CB, DISC, MC, V. Open: Mon–Fri 11:30 a.m.–3 p.m.
and 6–11:30 p.m.; Sat–Sun 6–11:30 p.m. 
Chef Allen’s
$$$
North Miami Beach
AMERICAN CONTEMPORARY
Foodies flock here for some of the best new-world cuisine in South Florida.
And although chef-owner Allen Susser is certainly a star in the culinary
world, the food is in the spotlight. Among the standouts are the goat

100

cheese–crusted lamb chops with lentils and roasted peppers, and mesquite-
grilled soft-shell crabs with pineapple salsa. Bottom line: Chef Allen’s 16-year-
old eatery stands out in a place where restaurants get flattened like wildlife
on an interstate.
See map p. 102. 19088 NE 29th Ave., just east of U.S. 1/Biscayne Boulevard at 191st
Street. % 305-935-2900. Reservations suggested. To get there: Take U.S. 1 north to
191st Street; turn right. Main courses: $24–$35, also $52 prix-fixe menu. AE, DISC,
MC, V. Open: Sun–Thurs 6–10:30 p.m.; Fri–Sat 6–11 p.m. 
The Forge
$$$
Miami Beach
AMERICAN
Although this restaurant looks like a leftover set from Dynasty, it actually
hails way back to the days of Al Capone and his hungry mobsters. The
caviar- (Beluga, naturally) and escargot-eating money crowd stops in here
regularly, although the atmosphere is more elegant than stuffy. When it
comes to entrees, red meat rules at The Forge — from prime rib and the
award-winning Super Steak to veal, rack of lamb, buffalo, and venison.
There’s an impressive wine list, and, if you ask nicely, you’ll be able to tour
the restaurant’s massive wine cellar, where, perhaps, Geraldo Rivera
should have looked first when searching for Capone’s tomb. 
See map p. 102. 432 Arthur Godfrey Rd., 1⁄2 mile west of Collins Avenue/A1A. % 305-538-
8533. Reservations suggested. To get there: From mainland, take the Julia Tuttle
Causeway into its merger with Arthur Godfrey Road. Main courses: $24–$40. AE, DISC,
MC, V. Open: Sun–Thurs 6 p.m.–midnight, Sat–Sun 6 p.m.–1 a.m. 
Grillfish
$
South Beach
SEAFOOD
Grillfish manages to pay the exorbitant South Beach rent with the help of
a loyal local following who come for fresh, simple seafood in a relaxed but
upscale atmosphere. The servers are friendly and know the menu well. The
barroom seafood chowder is full of chunks of shellfish, as well as some fresh
whitefish filets, all in a tomato broth. The small ear of corn, included with
each entree, is about as close as you’ll get to any type of vegetable offering
besides the pedestrian salad. Still, at these prices, it’s worth a visit to try
some local fare including mako shark, swordfish, tuna, marlin, and wahoo.
See map p. 98. 1444 Collins Ave. (corner of Espanola Way). % 305-538-9908.
Reservations for six or more only. Main courses: $9–$26. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V. Open:
Daily 11:30 a.m.–4 p.m. and 5:30 p.m.–midnight.
Hy-Vong

Little Havana
VIETNAMESE
An unlikely spot for a Vietnamese restaurant, Little Havana lucked out big
time with this place, where Vietnamese cuisine combines the best of Asian
and French cooking with spectacular results. Food at Hy-Vong is elegantly
simple and superspicy. Appetizers include small, tightly packed Vietnamese
spring rolls and kimchi, a spicy, fermented cabbage. Star entrees include

Joe Allen
$$
Miami Beach
AMERICAN
An offshoot of the Manhattan theater-district favorite, Joe Allen’s is located
on the bay side of the beach, nestled in an unassuming building conspic-
uously devoid of neon lights, valet parkers, and fashionable pedestrians.
Inside, however, one discovers a hidden jewel: a stark yet elegant interior
and no-nonsense, fairly priced, ample-portioned dishes such as meatloaf,
pizza, fresh fish, and salads. The scene has a homey feel favored by locals
looking to escape the hype without compromising quality.
See map p. 98. 1787 Purdy Ave./Sunset Harbor Dr. (3 blocks west of Alton Road),
% 305/531-7007. Reservations recommended, especially on weekends. Main courses:
$15–$25. MC, V. Open: Mon–Fri 11:30 a.m.–11:30 p.m.; Sat–Sun noon–11:30 p.m.
Joe’s Stone Crab Restaurant
$–$$$$
South Beach
SEAFOOD
What a clubby steakhouse is to Chicago, Joe’s Stone Crab is to Miami. An
institution of maddening proportion, Joe’s is possibly the one restaurant in
town to get away with accepting no reservations and making people wait
upwards of three — that’s right, three — hours for a table. Some say Joe’s
has a monopoly on the best, most succulent stone crabs out there, and we’d
venture to agree they’re right. For any seafood fan, Joe’s is an absolute must.
See map p. 98. 11 Washington Ave. (at Biscayne Street, just south of First Street).
% 305-673-0365, or 305-673-4611 for takeout. Reservations not accepted. To get there:
Take MacArthur Causeway to Washington Avenue; go right. Market price varies but
averages $62.95 for a serving of jumbo crab claws, $38.95 for large claws; other
entrees start at under $10. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V. Open: Mid-Oct–mid-May Tues–Sat
11:30 a.m.–2 p.m.; Mon–Thurs 5–10 p.m.; Fri–Sat 5–11 p.m.; Sun 4 p.m.–10 p.m.

Studio 54 wannabe. Star chef (and owner) Mark Militello is part of Miami’s
so-called Mango Gang — the chefs responsible for crafting and perfecting
New World Floribbean cuisine. Although his menu changes nightly, what

and aged sherry vinegar. For a main course, choose from strip steak with
truffle fries — the best fries you’ll ever eat, pan-cooked snapper with udon
noodles, or duck breast with grilled apples and fresh spinach. On Tuesday
nights, Metro becomes a big scene as local luminaries convene here for
cocktails, kibitzing, and star spotting.

Prepare to shell out a pretty penny for the very haute twist on American

mighty Tides Hotel. The air of elegance (perhaps pickled by the scent of
money) mixes with the fragrances of dishes such as the blue prawn risotto
with black trumpet mushrooms and curry, and warm maple and bourbon
smoked salmon. Save room for dessert because you’ll want to try the
Baked Jamaica — a luscious concoction of coffee and banana macadamia

Open since 1954 and still going strong, this historic, nostalgic delicatessen
extravaganza is one of Miami Beach’s greatest traditions. Scooch into one
of the ancient vinyl booths — which have hosted many a notorious
bottom, from Frank Sinatra’s to mob boss Sam Giancana’s — and review
the huge menu that’s loaded with authentic Jewish staples. Consider the
classic corned beef sandwich, stuffed cabbage, brisket, or potato pan-
cakes. If you’re lucky, the snarky waitress will give you a wax-paper doggy
bag to wrap up the leftover rolls and Danish from your breadbasket.
See map p. 102. 17190 Collins Ave. % 305-947-4581. To get there: Take I-95 to Ives
Dairy Road. Make a right on Ives Dairy and go east on the William Lehman Causeway.
Turn right onto Collins Avenue, and the restaurant is on the right. Main courses:
$8–$30. AE, MC, V. Open: Daily 7 a.m.–1 a.m.

Exploring Miami
In This Chapter
 Visiting must-see attractions and sights
 Playing and watching your favorite sports 
 Taking a guided tour
 Shopping your way through Miami
 Having some after-dark fun
A
fter you’ve had a chance to catch your breath and suck down some
calories, it’s time to start soaking in the sun and, the inevitable,
turning turnstiles. In this chapter, I start with the day shift, exploring
some of Miami’s top attractions, museums, and parks. I also give you
some shopping pointers. Then, as the sun sinks into the Everglades, I
start painting the town whatever color suits you.
Seeing the Top Sights
Miami offers a lot more than sunny stretches of sand and silicone. 
No matter how you want to spend your day — touring museums or
strolling through gardens of exceptional beauty — you’ll find some-
thing here that will hold your attention. (Check out the “Central Miami
Attractions” map if you want to see where the sights are in relation to
each other.)
Biscayne National Park
Mangroves, coral reefs, and tiny keys form this 181,000-acre refuge, located
30 miles south of Miami. Hikers can take advantage of 11⁄2- and 7-mile trails
through Elliott Key’s hardwood hammocks and mangroves, but you have
to hitch a boat ride ($26) from the park’s concessionaire, Biscayne
National Underwater Park (% 305-230-1100). Other possibilities include
renting a canoe ($9 an hour, $24 a half-day), taking a glass-bottom boat
tour ($24.45 adults, $19.45 seniors, $16.45 kids under 12; 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.
daily), going on a snorkeling trip ($35 including gear, 1:30 and 5:30 p.m.),
and going scuba diving ($54 for a two-tank dive including tanks, 8:30 a.m.).
Reservations are recommended for boat tours. With the time it takes to

Attractions in South Miami–Dade County
reach the park, allow all day to see it. If you really want to commune with
nature, camping fees are $15 per night.
See map p. 109. 9700 SW 328th St., Convoy Point Visitor Center. % 305-230-7275 or
305-230-1100. www.nps.gov/bisc and www.biscayne.national-park.com.
To get there: Take the Florida Turnpike and its Homestead extension south to Exit 6
(Speedway Boulevard), go left to SW 328th/North Canal Drive, go left again and 
continue about 5 miles to the entrance on the left. Admission: Free, but there are con-
cession fees (see preceding information). Open: Daily 8 a.m.–5:30 p.m

Coral Castle
There’s plenty of competition, but Coral Castle is probably the strangest
attraction in Florida. In 1923, the story goes, a 26-year-old crazed Latvian,
suffering from unrequited love of a 16-year-old who left him at the altar,
immigrated to South Miami and spent the next 25 years of his life carving
huge boulders into a prehistoric-looking roofless “castle.” Plan to spend
11⁄2 to 2 hours and make sure to hum along to Billy Idol’s “Sweet Sixteen,”
inspired by this very bizarre place.
See map p. 109. 28655 S. Dixie Hwy./U.S. 1. % 305-248-6344. www.coralcastle.
com. To get there: Take U.S. 1 south to SW 286th Street. Admission: $9.75 adults, $6.50
seniors 62 and older, $5 kids 7–11. Open: Daily 7 a.m.–9 p.m.
Everglades Alligator Farm
Take a noisy airboat tour of a spread that’s home to more than 3,000
creepy, surprisingly sedate specimens that seem to live off a diet of
Lithium. Don’t miss the “Weird Animal Show,” starring freaks of reptilian
nature. Allow 41⁄2 to 5 hours including the 2-hour round-trip drive from
downtown Miami.
See map p. 109. 40351 SW 192nd Ave., 2 miles west of Florida Turnpike. % 305-247-
2628. www.everglades.com. To get there: Follow U.S. 1 south to Palm Drive/SW
344th Street, go west/left to SW 192nd Avenue, left to entrance. Admission: $17 adults,
$10 kids 4–10 ($5 less if you don’t want to ride the airboat). Open: Daily 9 a.m.–6 p.m. 
Miami Metrozoo
This 290-acre, sparsely landscaped complex (it was devastated by
Hurricane Andrew) is about 45 minutes from Miami proper and the
beaches but worth the trip. Isolated and never really crowded, its also
completely cageless — animals are kept at bay by cleverly designed moats.
Favorite denizens include the Komodo dragons and white Bengal tiger.
This is a fantastic spot to take younger kids — the older ones seem bored
and unstimulated here. For the touchy-feely set, there’s a wonderful pet-
ting zoo and play area, and the zoo offers several daily programs designed
to educate and entertain. At a comfortable pace, you can see the zoo in
about four hours.
See map p. 109. 12400 SW 152nd St., at 124th Avenue. % 305-251-0400. www.miami
metrozoo.com. To get there: Take U.S. 1 south to 152nd Street/Coral Reef Drive, go
right/west past the Florida Turnpike to 124th. Admission: $12 adults, $7 kids 3–12.
Open: Daily 9:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m.
Miami Museum of Science and Space Transit Planetarium
This is the final — and only — frontier for sci-fi fans, with more than 140
hands-on exhibits that explore mysteries of the universe. Live demon-
strations and collections of rare natural-history specimens make a visit
here enjoyable and informative. Many of the demos involve audience

participation, which can be lots of fun for kids and adults alike. There is
also a Wildlife Center with more than 175 live reptiles and birds of prey. At
the adjacent Space Transit Planetarium, astronomy and laser shows pul-
sate to the tune of the Dave Matthews Band and Pink Floyd. Call, or visit
their Web site, for a list of upcoming exhibits and laser shows. Allow three
to four hours, depending on how long you want to play.
See map p. 114. 3280 S. Miami Ave./Bayshore Dr., south of Rickenbacker Causeway.
% 305-646-4200 or 305-646-4420 (planetarium show times). www.miamisci.org.
To get there: It’s on South Miami/Bayshore, just south of the Rickenbacker Causeway.
Admission: $10 adults, $8 seniors and students, $6 kids 3–12, half-price after 4:30 p.m.
Open: Daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m.
Miami Seaquarium
If you’ve been to Orlando’s SeaWorld, you may be disappointed with
Miami’s version, which is considerably smaller and not as well maintained.
You’ll need at least three hours to tour the 35-acre oceanarium and see all
four daily shows starring a number of showy ocean mammals. You can cut
your visit to two hours if you limit your shows to the better, albeit corny,
Flipper Show and Killer Whale Show. The highly regarded Water and
Dolphin Exploration Program (WADE) allows visitors to touch and swim
with dolphins in the Flipper Lagoon. The program costs $140 per person
and is offered twice daily, Wednesday through Sunday. Children must be at
least 52 inches tall to participate. Reservations are necessary for this pro-
gram. Call % 305-365-2501 in advance for reservations. 
See map p. 114. 4400 Rickenbacker Causeway, in Biscayne Bay. % 305-361-5705.
www.miamiseaquarium.com. To get there: Take the causeway from U.S. 1 near
Little Havana and go east halfway across Biscayne Bay. Admission: $24.95 adults,
$19.95 kids 3–9. An annual pass is just $5 more per person. Open: Daily 9:30 a.m.–6 p.m.
Monkey Jungle
Ever see a monkey in heat? You will here. You’ll also see rare Brazilian
golden lion tamarins and Asian macaques. No cages restrain the primates
as they swing, chatter, and play their way into your heart — and nose (see
the following paragraph). Screened-in trails wind through acres of “jungle,”
and daily shows feature the park’s most talented pupils. People who go
here are not monkeying around — many of the park’s frequent visitors are
scientists and anthropologists.
This place is not for the faint of smell, but if primates are your thing, you’ll
be in paradise here. If you’re forced here against your will, bring nose
plugs. Allow two and a half hours to see the park.
See map p. 109. 14805 SW 216th St., between South Miami and Homestead. % 305-
235-1611. www.monkeyjungle.com. To get there: Take U.S. 1 south to Cutler Ridge
and head west 2 miles on 216th Street. Admission: $15.95 adults, $12.95 kids 4–12.
Open: Daily 9:30 a.m.–5 p.m. 
Chapter 10: Exploring Miami 111

Parrot Jungle Island
This Miami institution took flight from its lush, natural South Miami envi-
ronment and headed north in the winter of 2003 to a new, overly fabri-
cated, disappointing $46 million home on Watson Island, along the
MacArthur Causeway near Miami Beach. While the island doubles as a pro-
tected bird sanctuary, the jungle’s former digs in the heart of South Miami
in a circa-1900 coral rock structure were a lot more charming and kitsch-
ier. The new, overpriced 19-acre park features an Everglades exhibit, a pet-
ting zoo, and several theaters, jungle trails, and aviaries. Watch your heads
because flying above are hundreds of parrots, macaws, peacocks, cocka-
toos, and flamingos. But it’s not all a loss. Be sure to check out the
Crocosaurus, a 20-foot-long saltwater crocodile who hangs out in the
park’s Serpentarium, which also houses the park’s reptile and amphibian
collection. You can see it all in three to four hours.
See map p. 114. 1111 Parrot Jungle Trail, Miami. % 305-2JUNGLE. www.parrot
jungle.com. To get there: Take McArthur Causeway toward the beaches, follow
signs. Admission: $23.95 adults, $21.95 kids 3–10. Open: Daily 9:30 a.m.–6 p.m. 
Villa Vizcaya Museum and Gardens
Sometimes referred to as the “Hearst Castle of the East,” this magnificent
villa was built in 1916 as a winter retreat for James Deering, cofounder and
former vice president of International Harvester. Packed with European
antiques and art from the 16th to the 19th centuries, the ornate mansion
took 1,000 artisans five years to complete. Most of the original furnishings,
including dishes and paintings, are still intact. You will see very early ver-
sions of a telephone switchboard, central vacuum cleaning system, eleva-
tors, and fire sprinklers. A free guided tour of the 34 furnished rooms on
the first floor takes about 45 minutes. The second floor, which consists
mostly of bedrooms, is open to tour on your own. Outside, lush formal gar-
dens, accented with statuary, balustrades, and decorative urns, front an
enormous swath of Biscayne Bay. Definitely take the tour of the rooms, but
immediately thereafter, you’ll want to wander and get lost in the resplen-
dent gardens. Allow two to two and a half hours, more if you’re really into
art and architecture.
See map p. 114. 3251 S. Miami Ave./Bayshore Dr. % 305-250-9133. To get there: It’s
on South Miami/Bayshore, south of the Rickenbacker Causeway. Admission: $12
adults, $5 kids 6–12. Open: Daily 9:30 a.m.–5 p.m. 
Finding More Cool Things to See and Do
For those who prefer to opt out of the Crocodile Hunter mode of sight-
seeing, there’s an army of things to do in Miami that are less expensive
and more leisurely. Some of these appeal to folks who have special
interests — whether that means being an art buff, a golfer, an avid fish-
erman, or a pro-sports fan.

Visiting museums, gardens, parks, and more
Some of Miami’s best museums and parks not only provide you with a
wonderful day’s entertainment and education, they do it for much less
than many of the city’s more popular attractions.
 Barnacle State Historic Site, 3485 Main Hwy., Coconut Grove 
(% 305-448-9445; www.floridastateparks.org/thebarnacle),
was built in 1891 as the home of naval architect Ralph Munroe and is
now a museum in the heart of Coconut Grove. It’s the oldest house in
Miami and rests on its original foundation, which sits on 5 acres of
hardwood and landscaped lawns. The house’s quiet surroundings,
wide porches, and period furnishings illustrate how Miami’s first
snowbird lived in the days before condo-mania and luxury hotels.
Enthusiastic and knowledgeable state park employees offer a wealth
of historical information to those interested in quiet, low-tech attrac-
tions like this one. Call for details on the fabulous monthly moonlight
concerts during which folk, blues, or classical music is presented
and picnicking is encouraged. It’s open Friday through Monday from
9 a.m. to 4 p.m.; admission is $1. See map p. 114.
 At Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park, 1200 S. Crandon Blvd., Key
Biscayne (% 305-361-5811; www.floridastateparks.org/cape
florida), at the southern tip of Key Biscayne about 20 minutes
from downtown Miami, you can explore the unfettered wilds and
enjoy some of the most secluded beaches in Miami. There’s also a
historic lighthouse that was built in 1825, which is the oldest light-
house in South Florida. A rental shack leases bikes, hydro-bikes,
kayaks, and many more water toys. It’s a great place to picnic, and
a newly constructed restaurant serves homemade Latin food,
including great fish soups and sandwiches. Bill Baggs has been 
consistently rated as one of the top ten beaches in the U.S. for its
11⁄4 miles of wide, sandy beaches and its secluded, serene atmos-
phere. Admission is $5 per car with up to eight people (or $3 for a
car with only one person; $1 to enter by foot or bicycle). It’s open
daily from 8 a.m. to sunset. Tours of the lighthouse are available
every Thursday through Monday at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. Arrive at
least an hour early to sign up — there’s only room for ten people
on each. See map p. 114.
 Holocaust Memorial, 1933 Meridian Ave., Miami Beach (% 305-538-
1663), stands out with Kenneth Triester’s Sculpture of Love and
Anguish, depicting victims of the concentration camps crawling up
a giant, yearning hand. Along the reflecting pool, marble slabs
relate the story of the Holocaust. At the center of the memorial, a
tableau provides a solemn and moving tribute to the millions of
Jews who lost their lives. You can walk through an open hallway
lined with photographs and the names of concentration camps and
their victims. From the street, you’ll see the outstretched arm, but
do stop and tour the sculpture at ground level. Open daily from 
9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Admission is free. See map p. 114.

Chapter 10: Exploring Miami 115

 Miami Children’s Museum, 980 MacArthur Causeway, Miami Beach
(% 305-373-5437; www.miamichildrensmuseum.org), this brand-
new museum, located across the MacArthur Causeway from Parrot
Jungle Island, is a modern, albeit odd-looking, Swiss-cheese
inspired facility. Kids-only activities and exhibitions related to the
arts, culture, community, and communication include a miniature
Bank of America and Publix Supermarket and a re-creation of the
NBC 6 television studio. There’s also a re-creation of a Carnival
Cruise ship and even a port stop in a re-created Brazil. Perhaps the
coolest thing of all is the World Music Studio, in which aspiring
Britneys, Justins, and Lenny Kravitzes can lay down a few tracks
and play instruments. Open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission
is $8 for adults and children. See map p. 114. 
 Miccosukee Indian Village and Airboat Tours, U.S. 41, 30 miles 
west of Miami (% 305-223-8380; www.miccosukeeresort.com/
mivillage.html), offers airboat rides, guided tours, alligator-
wrestling demonstrations, and Native American arts and crafts
exhibits. And because the village lies on a reservation, you’ll also
find cheap cigarettes and legal gambling. Open daily from 9 a.m. to 
5 p.m. Admission is $10 for adults, $7 for children 7 to 14; kids under
age 6 are free. Airboat rides are $10 per person. See map p. 114. 
 The Spanish Monastery Cloisters, 16711 W. Dixie Hwy., North Miami
Beach (% 305-945-1461), is allegedly the oldest building in the
Western Hemisphere, dating back to 1133. Erected in Segovia, Spain,
the cloisters were eventually purchased by newspaper magnate
William Randolph Hearst who brought them to America in pieces.
The carefully numbered stones were quarantined for years until
they were finally reassembled on the present site in 1954. It has
often been used as a backdrop for movies and commercials and is 
a very popular tourist attraction. Open Monday through Saturday 
10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Sunday from 1 to 5 p.m. Admission is $5 for
adults, $2.50 for seniors 55 and older, and $2 for kids 11 and under.
See map p. 114.
 Venetian Pool, 2701 DeSoto Blvd., Coral Gables (% 305-460-5356;
www.venetianpool.com), lets you follow in the strokes of Esther
Williams and Johnny Weissmuller by taking a dip in this pool, which
is fed by underground artesian wells. During summer, the pool’s
820,000 gallons of water are drained and refilled nightly, ensuring a
cool, clean swim. Hours vary seasonally so check their Web site or
call ahead before you go, but be warned that they’re sometimes
very slow to answer the telephone. Admission is $6.25 to $9.50 for
adults, and $3.25 to $5.25 for kids 3 to 12. Note: Kids under 3 are not
allowed to enter the facility, and the Venetian pool does not accept
credit or debit cards (cash and check only). See map p. 114.
 The Wolfsonian-Florida International University, 1001 Washington
Ave., Miami Beach (% 305-531-1001; www.wolfsonian.fiu.edu),
boasts the eclectic collection of pack rat Mitchell Wolfson, Jr., who
was known to horde everything from controversial Nazi propaganda
Part III: South Florida 
116

to King Farouk of Egypt’s match collection. Also thrown in the
diverse mix are zany works from great modernists such as Charles
Eames and Marcel Duchamp. Open Tuesday and Friday through
Saturday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., Thursday from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.,
and Sunday from noon to 5 p.m. Admission is $5 adults, $3.50 stu-
dents and seniors. See map p. 114.
Golfing
Golf is everywhere in Miami, and you can channel your inner Tiger
Woods at a number of excellent courses. For golfing information online,
haul your clubs over to www.golf.com and www.floridagolfing.com.
If you like surfing the old-fashioned way, request course information
from the Florida Sports Foundation (% 850-488-8347) or from Florida
Golfing (% 877-222-4653). Here are just a few of the courses you can
play while in Miami:

and -72) and a reputation as a golfer’s paradise. Greens fees are 
$95 to $130 and up winter, $25 to $65 summer.
Watching the big-league teams
The Miami area has franchises in each of the major sports. The line-up is
as follows:
Chapter 10: Exploring Miami 117

 Florida Marlins: Pro Player Stadium, 2269 NW 199th St., Miami 
(% 305-623-6100; www.flamarlins.com). The Sunshine State’s
lovable worst-to-first-to-worst-to-first Major League Baseball team
was assembled, and then dismantled by founding owner Wayne
Huizenga. The Marlins won the ’97 World Series, only to find Big
Wayne shedding the huge payroll he amassed to win it, which left
the team sucking cellar lint. They then showed him who’s boss by
beating the NY Yankees in 2003. It’s a fun roller coaster ride, to say
the least. The Marlins play their regular season home games here
from April to September. Tickets cost $2 to $45.
 Florida Panthers: National Car Rental Center, One Panther
Parkway, Fort Lauderdale (% 954-835-8275; www.flpanthers.
com). What do Miami and ice hockey have in common? Nothing.
The team doesn’t even play in the city proper. But that’s close
enough for Miamians to think it’s theirs. The National Hockey
League season runs November to April. It will set you back $14 to
$65 to cheer from the stands.
 Miami Dolphins: Pro Player Stadium, 2269 NW 199th St., Miami 
(% 305-623-6100; www.miamidolphins.com). It’s been a long time
since 1972’s perfect season, but fan support remains high — high
enough that it’s hard to get tickets to the eight regular-season home
games (Sept–Jan) or the preseason. And it isn’t cheap either: A
ticket costs $27 and up — way up!
 Miami Heat: American Airlines Arena, 601 Biscayne Blvd., Miami
(% 305-577-4328; www.nba.com/heat). The Heat hoopsters
entered the National Basketball Association in the 1988–89 season
and spent the first two years digging out of the cellar. By their tenth
season they had 50 wins in an 82-game schedule and their second
Atlantic Division title. In 2004, the Heat acquired their biggest win
by scoring Shaquille O’Neal, whose celebrity has made a Heat
ticket one of Miami’s, uh, hottest. The season runs November
through May. Tickets run from $14 to $150.
Fishing
Several saltwater species are common to all South Florida, including
trout, snook, Spanish and king mackerel, sailfish, grouper, and snapper.
Charters for small groups (up to four people) begin at about $225 per
half-day and $400 for eight hours of inshore fishing and about double
that for deep-sea excursions. Rates on large party boats usually start at
$25 ($40 for all day). Here are a couple places where you can get a guide
for your fishing expedition:
 Internet users can get plenty of information at Florida Charter
Captains online (www.fishfla.com), which breaks the state into
several regions and profiles guides in each area.
Part III: South Florida 
118

 The cheekily titled Sea Vous Play in the Crandon Park Marina on
Key Biscayne (% 305-361-7600) will take you out on various fish-
ing charters with expert guides.
Laying down some bets
You can wager your hard-earned money on the athletic ability of humans
or animals at several places. There is live and simulcast action at:
 Calder Race Course (% 305-625-1311), 2269 NW 199th St., Miami.
Horse racing.
 Flagler Greyhound Track (% 305-649-3000), 401 NW 38th Court,
Miami. Dog racing.
 Gulfstream Park (% 305-931-7223), at U.S. 1 and Hallandale Beach
Boulevard, North Miami Beach. Horse racing.
 Miami Jai Alai Fronton (% 305-633-6400), 3500 NW 37th Ave.,
Miami. Looks like lacrosse, but it’s called jai alai (pronounced 
hi-a-lie).
Seeing Miami by Guided Tour
If you want to leave decision-making to someone else, Miami has several
organized tour options.
Bus tours
The oldest and arguably one of the most reliable operators is Miami
Nice Excursions, 18430 Collins Ave., Miami Beach (% 305-949-9180).
The company offers knowledgeable guides and will pick you up from
your hotel. Minibus tours range from city sightseeing ($29–$95 for
adults, $25 for kids 4–12) to longer and more expensive ones that travel
to Key West, the Everglades, and the Kennedy Space Center. Beware,
however, that your tour is only as good as your guide and, truth be told,
Miami Nice has been known to hire a few that aren’t so, uh, nice.
The best tour for the morbidly curious, however, is the Murder,
Mystery, and Mayhem Bus Tour, Miami-Dade Cultural Center, 101 W.
Flagler St., Miami (% 305-375-1621), in which you’ll play witness to
Miami’s most celebrated crimes. From the killing spree of the Ashley
Gang to the murder of designer Gianni Versace, historian Paul George
conducts a fascinating tour of scandalous proportions. Tickets are $37
and advance reservations are strongly suggested.
Walking tours
The Biltmore Hotel Tour, 1200 Anastasia Ave., Coral Gables, is a free
guided overview (Sundays only at 1:30, 2:30, and 3:30 p.m.) of the his-
tory, mystery and, yes, ghosts, attached to this wonderful old hotel. You
must make a reservation by calling % 305-445-1926.
Chapter 10: Exploring Miami 119

The Miami Design Preservation League, 1001 Ocean Dr., South Beach
(% 305-672-2014), conducts 90-minute guided tours of the Art Deco
District on Thursdays at 6:30 p.m. and Saturdays at 10:30 a.m. ($10). If a
self-guided tour is more your speed, the league offers an audiotape tour
seven days a week for a cost of $10.
Boat tour
The Heritage of Miami II topsail schooner, Bayside Marketplace Marina,
401 Biscayne Blvd., Miami (% 305-442-9697), will sail you around the city
for two hours, passing by Villa Vizcaya, Coconut Grove, and Key Biscayne
and putting you in sight of Miami’s spectacular skyline and million-dollar
waterfront homes. Tickets for day tours are $20 adults, $15 children 12
and under. September through May only. Tours leave daily at 1:30, 4, and
6:30 p.m., and Friday through Sunday also at 9, 10, and 11 p.m.
Shopping
What to do in Miami when it rains? Go to a mall! With a dozen malls and
a crush of other retail centers, Miami is a shopping mecca for Florida,
the Southeast, and the Caribbean. Best of all, the area offers more than
tourist trinkets. The 10 million people who visit every year lug home
everything from hand-rolled cigars to electronics to imports from the
Caribbean.
Before I outline Miami’s neighborhoods and the shops you can find in
them, here are a few basic ground rules:
 Most stores are open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through
Saturday and noon to 5 p.m. Sunday. Those in malls and major shop-
ping centers keep their doors open as late as 9 or 10 p.m. except on
Sunday. Stores on South Beach run on their own, wacky schedules,
usually not opening before 11 a.m. and closing near midnight.
 The state and local sales taxes add 6.5 percent to all purchases
except food and medicine.
Part III: South Florida 
120
A really quacky tour
It’s not exactly a luxury yacht like JLo’s or Puffy’s, but that’s okay because it’s fun. The
Miami Duck Tours, in which massive “vesicles” — part car, part boat — in the shape
of ducks tool up to 49 passengers around Miami on land and sea. The ducks are actu-
ally cooler than your average yacht because they drive on land and sail in the water.
Tickets are $24 adults, $21 seniors, and $17 children. Reserve your seat on the, uh,
duck, by calling % 877-DUCKTIX.

 If you don’t want to haul it home with you, most stores will ship
your purchase for you, though I recommend using some discretion.
If you don’t know the store, it’s safer to make your own arrange-
ments through a carrier such as UPS (% 800-742-5877), or the post
office (skip ahead to “Fast Facts” for more on mailing packages).
Burning some bucks
When you feel the urge to splurge on a shopping spree, here are the best
places to empty your wallet:
 Aventura: All shopaholics need to know about Aventura is that it’s
home to the mammoth Aventura Mall (see “Crawling through the
malls,” later in this chapter).
 Calle Ocho: Little Havana’s main shopping district is “Eighth Street”
between SW 27th and SW 12th avenues. In addition to tantalizing
smells, you can find everything from hand-rolled cigars to traditional
Cuban shirts known as guayaberas to Latin CDs and tapes.
 Coconut Grove: The Grove’s roomy sidewalks, particularly along
Main Highway and Grand Avenue, are very shopper-friendly. You
can find them lined with cafes as well as hippy and hipster bou-
tiques, mass-marketed clothiers à la the Gap and Banana Republic,
and import stores for shopping or browsing. The Grove is also the
home of CocoWalk (see the following section on malls).
 Coral Gables/Miracle Mile: Actually, it’s the Miracle Half-Mile, and
it’s peppered with not-so-trendy men’s and women’s clothing
stores. Your best bet here is to browse the cool furniture shops and
then spend your money on one of the area’s excellent restaurants.
 Downtown Miami: If you like to bargain, Flagler Street west of
Biscayne Boulevard is a good place to try your luck finding watches
and jewelry, luggage, shoes, and other leather goods. But it’s also a
place where you can get hustled if you’re not careful.
 South Beach: Some hip clothing stores (Von Dutch, Barneys Co-Op,
Urban Outfitters, Armani Exchange, Benetton, and others) line
Collins and Washington avenues between Sixth and Ninth streets,
which also are good places to see Art Deco architecture. The seven-
block Lincoln Road Mall offers a dizzying array of cafes and clone-
producing chain shops (Gap, Banana, Victoria’s Secret, bebe, and
so on).
Crawling through the malls
Because most of Miami’s shopping gets done in malls that could qualify
as neighborhoods in and of themselves, here are a few of the best in
town:
Chapter 10: Exploring Miami 121

 Aventura Mall: This mega mall — 250 stores fill up 2.3 million
square feet — is home to retail giants such as Bloomingdale’s,
Macy’s, and Lord & Taylor as well as smaller local outfits. Stock up
some energy at the mall’s plethora of restaurants, or let your kids
run down their batteries inside the mall’s playground. The complex
also has a 24-screen movie theater. Biscayne Boulevard and 196th
Street, Aventura (% 305-935-1110; www.shopaventuramall.com).
 Bal Harbour Shops: The Rodeo Drive of Miami, Bal Harbour’s head-
liners include Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, Cartier, Prada,
Dolce & Gabbana, Chanel, Armani, Christian Dior, Gucci, and
Tiffany. It’s worth a look even if you can’t afford the lofty prices.
9700 Collins Ave., Bal Harbour (% 305-866-0311; www.balharbour
shops.com).
 Bayside Marketplace: This waterside shopping à la New York City’s
South Street Seaport area features all the mall regulars, including
Sam Goody, Speedo Fitness, and Sharper Image. 401 Biscayne Blvd.,
Miami (% 305-577-3344; www.baysidemarketplace.com).
 CocoWalk: In addition to such name tenants as Banana Republic
and Victoria’s Secret, this mini outdoor mall has specialty stores
selling cigars, books, cutlery, clothing, fragrances, and more. It also
has a movie theater and several outdoor cafes. 3015 Grand Ave.,
Coconut Grove (% 305-444-0777; www.cocowalk.com).
 The Falls: This outdoor mall is worth the hike if you’re going south
and are in the market for Macy’s, Bloomingdale’s, Coach, and The
Disney Store. If not, they’re flanked by 100 other shops, a few
restaurants, and a movie theater. 8888 SW 136th St., Miami (% 305-
255-4570; www.thefallsshoppingcenter.com).
 Village of Merrick Park: This mammoth upscale outdoor shopping
complex features Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, Armani, Gucci,
Jimmy Choo, and Yves St. Laurent, to name a few. 4425 Ponce de
León Blvd. (between Ponce de León Boulevard and Le Jeune Road,
just off the Mile), Coral Gables. (% 305-529-0200; www.villageof
merrickpark.com).
You can find scores of other places to test your credit line or liquidate
your traveler’s checks at Miami International Mall, State Road 836 at
NW 107th Avenue. (% 305-593-1775), and Dadeland Mall, Kendall Drive
at U.S. 1 (% 305-655-6226).
Living It Up After Dark
After the sun goes down, Miami really raises the decibel level, the disco
ball, and the night owls. You can boogie down, rhumba and samba, or
just swill and chill. For an up-to-date scorecard, see the Miami Herald’s
“Weekend” section on Fridays. Tickets for specific events, concerts,
plays, and other performances can be booked through Ticketmaster
(% 305-358-5885; www.ticketmaster.com).

122

Toasting the town
If a mixed drink is more your style than mixing it up on the dance floor,
you can find many bars waiting to launch you on alcoholic adventure.
 The Clevelander Hotel, 1021 Ocean Dr., South Beach (% 305-531-
3485), has the quintessentially South Beach bar with swimming
pool, neon, glass blocks, plastic cups, out-of-towners, a beachy feel,
and (best of all) no cover charge. Drinks are half-price from 5 to 
7 p.m., Monday through Friday.
 The Forge, 432 41st St., Miami Beach (% 305-538-8533), is an opu-
lent, Dynasty-esque restaurant/bar known for its fabulous people
watching, especially on Wednesday, which is “models” night. Call
well in advance if you want a table so you can gawk while you eat.
There’s no cover.
 Mac’s Club Deuce, 222 14th St., Miami Beach (% 305-673-9537), is
the quintessential dive bar, with cheap drinks and a cast of charac-
ters ranging from your typical barfly to your atypical drag queen.
It’s got a well-stocked jukebox, friendly bartenders, a pool table,
and best of all, it’s an insomniac’s dream, open daily from 8 a.m. to
5 a.m.
 Mynt, 1921 Collins Ave., Miami Beach (% 786-276-6132), is nothing
more than a huge living room in which models, celebrities, and
assorted hangers-on bask in the green glow to the beats of very
loud lounge and dance music. If you want to dance — or move, for
that matter — this is not the place in which to do so. It’s all about
striking a pose in here.
 The Room, 100 Collins Ave., Miami Beach (% 305-531-6061), is an
intimate, candlelit beer and wine bar with vintages and brews hail-
ing from all over the world. The crowd is laid back, mature, and
decidedly local. 
 Rose Bar at the Delano, 1685 Collins Ave., South Beach (% 305-
672-2000), is one of the hottest of the many beach bars. The in
crowd and its wannabes hang at the Rose or on its deck. The drinks
are rather pricey, but there’s no cover.
 Tobacco Road, 626 S. Miami Ave., Miami (% 305-374-1198), is
small and gritty and meant to be that way. Escape the smoke and
sweat in the backyard patio, where air is a welcome commodity.
Live music, cheap drinks, good food, and interesting characters are
what make this, the owner of Miami’s very first liquor license, one
of the city’s favorite bars.
Clubbing
South Beach, and, lately, downtown Miami, offer some of the hottest —
and often snootiest — dance clubs in America. To get past the velvet
rope, dress hip (such as wearing black) and arrive before midnight.
Check out the following:
Chapter 10: Exploring Miami 123

 Club Space, 142 NE 11th St., Miami (% 305-577-1007), is a cavernous,
converted warehouse consisting of over 30,000 square feet of, uh,
its namesake, in which you can twirl around all night — literally 
(it has an all-night liquor license) — to the tunes of the planet’s
hottest dance, techno, and electronic DJs. Cover ranges from free
to $20.
 Crobar, 1445 Washington Ave., South Beach (% 305-531-8225), has
raised the bar on South Beach nightlife with crazy theme nights,
top-name DJs, and the occasional celebrity appearance. On Sunday,
the club hosts an extremely popular gay night known as Anthem.
Cover ranges from $15 to $25.
 La Covacha, 10730 NW 25th St., Miami (% 305-594-3717), is the
hottest Latin joint in the city. Sunday features the best in Latin rock,
with local and international acts. But the shack is really jumping on
weekends when it stays open until 5 a.m. Friday is the night here.
 Mansion, 1235 Washington Ave., South Beach (% 305-532-1525), is
the newest member of the Opium (see below) group of hauter than
thou nightclubs in which a multilevel uber lounge complete with
wood flooring and brick walls draws the who’s who of gossip
columns and Access Hollywood. Cover ranges from $20 to $30.
 Nikki Beach Club, 101 Ocean Dr., South Beach (% 305-538-1111),
is an outdoor oasis that seems very Brady Bunch goes to Hawaii,
with a sexy tiki hut/Polynesian theme, albeit rated R. The Sunday
afternoon beach party is almost legendary and worth a glimpse —
that is, if you can get in. Cover ranges from $10 to $20.
 Opium Garden, 136 Collins Ave., South Beach (% 305-531-5535), is
a highly addictive nocturnal habit for those looking for a combina-
tion of sexy dance music, scantily clad dancers, and, for masochists,
an oppressive door policy in which two sets of velvet ropes are set
up to keep those deemed unworthy out of this open-air, see-and-be-
scenery den of inequity. Cover ranges from $10 to $30.
 Rumi, 330 Lincoln Rd., South Beach (% 305-672-4353), is a very
good restaurant with an even better late-night scene that’s home to
hipsters, celebs, and lounge lizards. No cover.
Pursuing splashes of culture
It may be more acclaimed for its clubs and bars, but Miami does have a
respectable number of cultural institutions. If Beethoven and Bach have
more appeal than technoelectronica, you won’t have a problem finding a
place to hear a little night music.
The Concert Association of Florida, 555 17th St., South Beach (% 305-
532-3491; www.concertfla.org), is always up to speed on upcoming
performances. Season after season, world-renowned dance companies
and seasoned virtuosi (Itzhak Perlman, Andre Watts, and Kathleen
Battle, to name a few) punctuate its schedules.
Part III: South Florida 
124

Miami is also home to three excellent symphonic orchestras:
 The Florida Philharmonic Orchestra, 1243 University Dr., Miami
(% 800-226-1812), is the best of its kind in South Florida.
 The Miami Chamber Symphony, 5690 N. Kendall Dr., Kendall 
(% 305-672-0552; www.miamisymphony.org), features interna-
tional soloists.
 The New World Symphony, 541 Lincoln Rd., South Beach (% 305-
673-3331; www.nws.org), is under the direction of Michael Tilson
Thomas, who leads the gifted young musicians in performances,
many of which are free.
The Florida Grand Opera, 1200 Coral Way, Miami (% 800-741-1010 or
305-854-1643; www.fgo.org), will open a new headquarters in mid-2005.
The respected company features top singers from America and Europe.
The highly acclaimed Miami City Ballet, Ophelia and Juan Js. Roca Center
(2200 Liberty Ave.), Miami Beach (% 305-929-7000; www.miamicity
ballet.org), runs through a repertoire of more than 60 ballets in a given
season.
Fast Facts
Chapter 10: Exploring Miami 125
Area Code
Miami’s two area codes are 305 and 786.
All local calls made inside Miami-Dade
County require ten-digit dialing: the area
code plus the seven-digit local number.
Calls from Miami to the Keys (see Chapter
11), which are in the 305 area code,
require a 1 + 305 or 0 + 305 preceding the
seven-digit number. Those will be billed
as long distance. 
Hospitals
HealthSouth Doctors’ Hospital, 5000
University Drive in Coral Gables (% 305-
666-2111) has a 24-hour emergency
department. 
Mail
U.S. post offices are located at 2200 NW
72nd Ave., Miami (west of the airport);
1300 Washington Ave., South Beach; and
3191 Grand Ave., Coconut Grove. To locate
other postal offices, call % 800-275-8777.
Maps
The information sources listed in the pre-
vious section are great ones to hit up for
maps before or after you land. (Trust me:
Good maps are necessities because get-
ting lost in Miami is easy, and this city’s
bad neighborhoods are no place to get
lost in.) Rental-car agencies are another
good source (including those at the air-
port) and so are convenience stores,
which sell maps for $3 to $5.
Newspapers
The Miami Herald (www.herald.com) is
the major daily, and visitors shouldn’t miss
the paper’s “Weekend” entertainment
guide, which comes out on Friday. There’s
also a Spanish-language paper, El Nuevo
Herald (www.elherald.com).
Safety
Miami is a large city and has all the crime
that you would normally associate with a

major metropolis. I don’t recommend walk-
ing alone after dark; be wary about driving
anywhere in downtown Miami. Stick to
well-lit and known tourist areas, and even
then, be aware of your surroundings. Keep
your eyes peeled for bright-orange sun-
bursts on highway exit signs; they will
direct you to tourist-friendly zones. Use a
map (see preceding information on maps)
to familiarize yourself with the city and
make sure you know where you’re going
and your route before driving anywhere.
Never stop on a highway and get out of
your car if you can avoid it, and always
keep your doors locked. Some car-rental
agencies will rent you a cellphone for the
duration of your trip; this way you can get
immediate assistance if you need it.
Taxes
The sales and local-option taxes throughout
Miami-Dade County add 6.5 percent to most
purchases except medicines and groceries.
The hotel and restaurant taxes push the
total to between 9.5 and 12.5 percent.
Taxis
It’s $1.50 to $3 to start the meter and $2 for
each mile. See Chapter 9 for details.
Transit Info
For Metrorail and Metromover schedule

Unlocking the Keys
In This Chapter
 Orienting yourself with the Keys
 Snorkeling and diving for sunken treasure in Key Largo
 Fishing for snapper, grouper, and marlin in Islamorada
 Swimming with dolphins in Marathon
 Getting back to nature in the Lower Keys
 Visiting Hemingway’s retreat in Key West
S
outh Florida has two kinds of conchs: those that land in chowder
and those that land where they please. The latter — Florida Keys
natives — are born with a birthright to go against the grain and indulge
in a little wacky behavior — traits that are carried out to the nth degree
in the Keys’ southernmost city, Key West.
The most famous of Florida’s islands, Key West has threatened to secede
from the Union and establish a Conch Republic three times (and count-
ing). The top pastimes in Key West are fishing and getting fried (in a
Bacardi sense), and not necessarily in that order. It’s a city whose melting-
pot character has long made Key West a home for pirates, preachers, gun
runners, and gays, all of whom live more or less peacefully on a 31⁄2-mile
sandbar some locals call “paradise.”
Of course, paradise isn’t for everyone, including those Conchs (pro-
nounced konks) who settled to the north in towns and on islands with
far less razzle-dazzle but an equal amount of charm.
In this chapter, I show you the many faces of the Keys, including those
where the only action is diving after a 300-year-old shipwreck, landing a
tarpon, or swimming with dolphins.
Getting There
Most folks fly into the Keys because flying is convenient and usually
economical. However, if you’ll also be sightseeing elsewhere in Florida
(especially the Miami area, which is about four hours from Key West),
the scenic, albeit oftentimes trafficky, drive on U.S. 1/the Overseas
Highway can become part of your travel experience as well.

By plane
If you’re visiting the Upper or Middle Keys, your best bet is to book a
flight to Miami International Airport (% 305-876-7000; www.miami-
airport.com) and then rent a car to drive to Key Largo, Islamorada, or
Marathon. The airport is served by more than 100 airlines, including 
42 foreign carriers, and virtually every car-rental agency in the U.S. (see
the Appendix for rental-agency telephone numbers and Web sites; see
Chapter 9 for more airport information).From Miami International
Airport, it’s a three- to four-hour drive to the Lower Keys and Key West,
depending on the traffic. If you want to avoid the long commute, lock
onto a commuter flight from Miami International Airport to Key West
International (% 305-296-7223), which is about 25 minutes south of the
Lower Keys. This airport is served by about a half-dozen major carriers
or their partners, as well as Avis, Hertz, Budget, and Dollar. (See the
Appendix for rental-agency telephone numbers and Web sites.)
By car
From the Florida/Georgia border to Key Largo is 500 miles. From the
north, take the Florida Turnpike south along the East Coast. Just after
Fort Lauderdale, take Exit 4 — the Turnpike Extension, which is marked
for Homestead/Key West. This goes to U.S. 1 in Florida City, the only
road into the Keys.
From the West Coast, come across I-75 (Alligator Alley) to the Miami exit
and go south to the Turnpike Extension.
Alligator Alley is not the best of roads, so make sure to check your tires
and fill up your tank before you get on it. Cellphone reception here is
slim to none, so be sure to have all necessary equipment available in the
event of a flat tire. Also, if at all possible, drive it during daylight hours
only. You wouldn’t want to get stuck here at night — there are no lights
and no gas stations, and the only watering holes around are those that
are populated by alligators and assorted swamp-life.
The drive from Miami to the Keys is a scenic, yet often congested, three
to four hours. From Miami International Airport, take LeJeune Road
south to Highway 836 West and the Turnpike Extension; then go south to
U.S. 1 and the Keys.
By train
Even rail fans find that train travel to the Keys is time-consuming. Amtrak
(% 800-872-7245; www.amtrak.com) has two trains leaving daily from
New York — that’s the good news. The bad news: They take 30 hours to
reach Miami (the furthest south they go); you’ll then have to get on a bus
to reach the Keys. In addition, rail prices aren’t much cheaper than air-
fare (and they cost more if you want a sleeper). Amtrak’s Miami station is
5 miles from the airport, which is where you’ll find the best rental-car
options.

Getting a Clue about the Keys
Although 400 islands are spread across this 150-mile chain, only a few
dozen are inhabited, and fewer yet are developed into something a main-
stream tourist would want to see. I subdivided them into five miniregions:
Key Largo, Islamorada, Marathon, the Lower Keys, and Key West. You’ll
find them in the same sequence if you drive from the mainland, traveling
from Florida City on U.S. 1. Skip ahead to the map of the Florida Keys for
an overview of the area.
Getting Around
Think car. Trains, public transit, and taxis that travel the entire length of
the islands are nonexistent in the Keys. With the possible exception of Key
West, the only way to get around is by car or on one of those you-have-to-
go-where-we-want-to-go tours. See Chapter 4 for more on package tours.
After you exit the mainland, U.S. 1 (the Overseas Highway) is the only
route through the island chain — the Keys’ version of Main Street.
Given one highway and the liberal use of mile markers for addresses
and reference points (skip ahead to the next paragraph in this section
for more information), it’s next to impossible to get lost driving in the
Keys, unless — due to the Mob, the IRS, or your ex-spouse — you want
to get lost. The speed limit throughout the Keys is no higher than 
55 mph, and there are occasional passing lanes. Reaching the Upper
Keys from Miami is a piece of cake, but if you’re going farther south,
driving gets tedious, sometimes aggravating. If you have the time and
budget and you want to drive down U.S. 1, consider taking two days to
travel from one end to the other.
The best way to find something in the Keys is to know the mile marker
(MM) that’s nearest that destination. Often used in place of addresses,
the little green mile-marker signs adorn the roadside every mile, starting
south of Florida City with MM 127 and running south to MM 1 in Key
West. For a general guide to the Mile Marker system, see Table 12-1.

The Florida Keys

Key Largo
The Upper Keys are a refuge for many South Floridians who love the
region’s laid-back lifestyle and lack of congestion. Convenient to Miami
but heavily built up, Key Largo is a favorite of saltwater fishermen and
scuba divers, with many outfitters, motels, and restaurants catering to
their needs.
Spending the night
The first and largest Florida Key, Key Largo offers a wide variety of
accommodations, from chain hotels to full-scale resorts. Most hotels are
right off U.S. 1 or on the waterfront. Since the accommodations generally
combine a laid-back atmosphere with extensive facilities, you can do as
much or as little as you want. Unless otherwise noted, all listings include
air-conditioning, televisions, a pool, and free parking. As with much of
coastal Florida, winter (Dec–Apr) is peak season. And don’t forget to add
an additional 11.5 percent room tax to your hotel rate.
Bay Harbor Lodge
$–$$
Key Largo
A small, simple retreat that’s big on charm, the Bay Harbor Lodge is an
extraordinarily welcoming place. The motel rooms are small and ordinary
in decor, but even the least expensive is recommendable. The efficiencies
are larger motel rooms with fully equipped kitchenettes. Larger still, the
oceanfront cottages have full kitchens and represent one of the best values
in the Keys. The 11⁄2 lush acres of grounds are planted with banana trees
and have an outdoor heated pool and several small barbecue grills. A small
beach is ideal for quiet sunning and relaxation, and guests can use the row-
boats, paddleboats, canoes, kayaks, and snorkeling equipment. Bring your
own beach towels.

Casa Morada
$$$–$$$$
Key Largo
This 16-suite boutique hotel is tucked away off a sleepy street and radi-
ates serenity and style in an area where serenity is aplenty but style elu-
sive. Originally built in the 1950s, Casa Morada sits on 1.7 acres of prime
bay-front land, which was upgraded with gorgeous landscaping, a lime-
stone grotto, a freshwater pool, a waterside terrace for breakfast, lunch,
and poolside beverage service, and a bocce ball court. Each of the cool
rooms features either a private garden or terrace — request the one with
the open air Jacuzzi that faces the bay. While the decor is decidedly island,
think St. Barts rather than, say, Gilligan’s. Although the hotel doesn’t have
Chapter 11: Unlocking the Keys 131

a restaurant, a complimentary breakfast is served daily, and if you order
out from one of the area’s excellent restaurants, the hotel will replate the
food on Casa Morada china.

Kona Kai Resort & Gallery
$$–$$$
Key Largo
The quintessential Keys retreat, this 11-unit resort overlooks the Gulf and
sits on 2 beautifully landscaped acres — the antidote to your typical mass-
marketed chain hotel. Lounge chairs, hammocks, a Jacuzzi, and a compact
beach are available for those who just want to relax (no phones in the
rooms make relaxing imperative), while the owners will organize excur-
sions to the Everglades, the backcountry, or wherever for the more adven-
turous. All the rooms are very private and simply furnished; bathroom
amenities are fabulous, with lotions, soaps, and shampoos made from trop-
ical fruits. An art gallery featuring work by American and international
painters, photographers, and sculptors doubles as the property’s office
and lobby. Note: Children under age 16 are not permitted.

Jules’ Undersea Lodge
$$$$
Key Largo
Staying here is certainly an experience of a lifetime — if you’re brave
enough to take the plunge. Originally built as a research lab in the 1970s,
this small underwater compartment (which rests on pillars on the ocean
floor) now operates as a two-room hotel. As expensive as it is unusual,
Jules’ is most popular with diving honeymooners. To get inside, guests
swim 21 feet under the structure and pop up into the unit through a 4-by-
6-foot “moon pool” that gurgles soothingly all night long. The 30-foot-deep
underwater suite consists of two separate bedrooms that share a common
living area. Room service will deliver your meals, daily newspapers, even
a late-night pizza in waterproof containers at no extra charge.

fast, dinner, equipment, and diving. AE, DISC, MC, V.
Dining locally
This is a seafood lover’s destination. During the season, many restau-
rants offer Florida lobster. The local favorites also include grouper, trout,
swordfish, tuna, mahimahi, and crab. If you’re not a seafood lover, don’t
Part III: South Florida 
132

worry: All restaurants offer meat and poultry entrees. And don’t forget
to try a slice of Key lime pie — it’s almost a mandatory dessert in the
Keys. Note: All Florida restaurants and food-serving bars are smoke-free.
Calypso’s
$
Key Largo
SEAFOOD
The awning still bears the name of the former restaurant, Demar’s, but the
food here is all Todd Lollis’s, an inspired young chef who looks like he may
be more comfortable at a Grateful Dead concert than in a kitchen, but who
turns out inventive seafood dishes in a casual and rustic waterside setting.
The prices are surprisingly reasonable, but the service can be a little more
laid back than you’re used to.
See map p. 130. 1 Seagate Blvd., MM 99.5. % 305-451-0600. To get there: Turn
towards the bay at the blinking yellow lights near MM 99.5 to Ocean Bay Drive and
then turn right. Look for the blue vinyl-sided building on the left. Main courses $9–$18.
MC, V. Open: Wed–Mon 11:30 a.m.–10 p.m.; Fri and Sat until 11 p.m.
The Fish House
$–$$
Key Largo
SEAFOOD
This fun spot serves up great local seafood. Conch (in a salad, floating in
chowder, or fried) is one headliner. So are oysters, shrimp, and yellowtail
snapper. Keep your eye on the back door to see what local fisherman are
bringing in for the day. The service is fast and the atmosphere relaxed,
even whimsical, making it a good spot to bring the kids. If you want to
bring the catch of the day back home with you, there’s a fish market on
premises.

Exploring Key Largo
Much of the doings here are related to water — Florida Bay to the west
and the Atlantic Ocean to the east.
Dolphins Plus
Key Largo
One of a few swim-with-the-dolphins programs around the Keys, Dolphins
Plus gives you a briefing before you get into the water. This is a dolphin-
contact sport. You need to be a good swimmer (despite the flotation vest
that you’re required to wear) and comfortable in water that’s taller than
you are. There are three swims daily at 8:30 a.m., 12:45 p.m. and 3 p.m. If
dolphins aren’t your thing, a sea lion swim program is offered seven days
a week at 9:15 a.m. and 1:15 p.m. for anyone 7 years or older. If you just
want to watch, you can do it from high and dry. Allow two hours.
See map p. 130. 31 Corinne Place. % 305-451-1993. www.dolphinsplus.com. To
get there: Go towards the ocean at the stoplight at MM 99.9, go 1 block, take the first
right, go another block, then left on Ocean Shores Drive, and go several blocks to a
bridge, turning right just before it. Admission: dolphin swim $160 (minimum age: 10);
sea lion swim $75 (minimum age 7); $10 to observe either swim ($5 for kids 7 and
older). Open: Daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m. 
Florida Keys Wild Bird Center
Tavernier
Wander through lush canopies of mangroves on narrow wooden walkways
to see the large variety of native birds, including broad-wing hawks, great
blue and white herons, roseate spoonbills, white ibis, cattle egrets, and
pelicans. A not-for-profit center, it serves as a hospital for birds that have
been injured by accident or disease. Visit at feeding time, usually about
3:30 p.m., when you can watch the dedicated staff feed the hundreds of
hungry beaks. Allow 30 to 60 minutes; more if there’s a photographer in
your group.

John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park
The first underwater preserve in the country, this 188-square-mile sanctuary
protects part of the only living coral reef in the continental United States.
Start off at the visitor center, which has a large saltwater aquarium that 
re-creates a reef ecosystem. At the adjacent dive shop, you can rent snor-
keling and diving equipment, and join one of the boat trips that depart for
the reef throughout the day. Along the reef, much of the water is shallow
enough that snorkelers can easily see its 40-something varieties of coral, 650
species of fish, and Christ of the Deep, a 9-foot, 4,000-pound bronze sculp-
ture that stands in 25 feet of water. Not getting wet is a shame, but if you
insist on staying dry, take the glass-bottom boat tour. Boaters will also enjoy
exploring the blue-green waters, with rentals of 19- to 28-foot motorboats
offered by the hour ($27–$50), half-day ($90–$185), and full-day ($160–$325).
For most visitors, this is an all-day outing.
See map p. 130. U.S. 1/Overseas Highway, MM 102.5 (oceanside, just a tad south 
of where U.S. 1 comes from the mainland). % 305-451-1202 or 305-451-1621.
www.pennekamp.com. Admission: $4 for a vehicle plus 50¢ per passenger; $1.50
for foot soldiers or bicyclists. Open: Daily 8 a.m.–5 p.m.
Touring the waters
Arguably, the Keys offer some of the finest underwater fun anywhere in
the United States. Even if you’re not a certified scuba diver or lack the
time to get certified here, you can still enjoy it. All it takes is a mask,
snorkel, and fins. John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park (described in
the preceding section) and The Key Largo National Marine Sanctuary
(% 305-451-1621; www.fknms.nos.noaa.gov) are Key Largo’s signature
underwater sights. The sanctuary is heaven for divers, who’ll love
Molasses Reef’s abundant sea life and the Elbow, which has several 
shipwrecks.
In addition to the dive shop at John Pennekamp, other area outfitters
include Conch Republic Divers, MM 90.3 (% 800-274-3483 or 305-852-
1655; www.conchrepublicdivers.com), and Keys Diver Snorkel Tours,
MM 100 (% 888-289-2402 or 305-451-1177; www.keysdiver.com). Prices
vary, but snorkel tours start at $35, and dive tours, at $65.
Boaters should also head for John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park,
described earlier in this chapter. Call % 305-451-1202 or 305-451-6325
for details.
Fishing is another favorite Keys pastime. Sport fish, such as bonefish,
tarpon, and marlin, are plentiful here, as are tasty treats such as grouper,
yellowtail snapper, and red snapper. Inshore rates generally are $225 for
a half-day and $400 for eight hours. Double that price for deep-sea expe-
ditions. Charter operators include Back Country Adventures (% 305-
451-1247) and Sailor’s Choice (% 305-451-1802).

Shopping for local treasures
Unless you’re looking to stock up on T-shirts and cheesy souvenirs, don’t
come to Key Largo to shop, with the following exceptions:
 Key Lime Products, 95231 U.S. 1/Overseas Hwy., MM 95 oceanside
(% 305-853-0378), sells some funky items made from the namesake
fruit. The shelves are lined with the usual (pies, jellies, and candy),
as well as more unusual gifts (hair- and skin-care products, pasta,
cheesecakes, salsa, and soap).
 For a real Keys-style shopping experience, head for the weekend
flea market held Saturday and Sunday at MM 103.5 (% 305-664-
4615). Dozens of vendors sell a wide variety of merchandise —
antiques, T-shirts, shoes, books, among others — from 9 a.m. 
to 5 p.m.
Living it up after dark
Folks tend to party here at any hour, acting under the premise that it’s 
5 p.m. somewhere on the planet. Most of the action is at motel bars. Other
options include Snapper’s Waterfront Saloon & Raw Bar, 139 Seaside
Ave., MM 94.5 oceanside (% 305-852-5956), which is open nightly and
usually has a band on weekends. Snook’s Bayside (see the listing under
“Dining locally” earlier in this chapter) has a guitar player on Thursday
night and combos on Friday and Saturday.
Islamorada
The next major key south of Key Largo is not going to dethrone Walt
Disney World as the top tourist draw, but Islamorada (“the purple
island”) has a lot of daytime fun and even a few places to keep you enter-
tained at night. The unofficial capital of the Upper Keys, it has the area’s
best atmosphere, food, and lodging. You can find more fishing boats per
square mile here than in any other vacation destination. Oh yes, it’s pro-
nounced eye-lah mor-ah-dah.
Spending the night
Sport fishing rules in Islamorada, and the hotels and resorts cater to the
anglers who come to participate in annual fishing events or to just kick
back and enjoy the emerald waters. Depending on your budget, you can
choose from several accommodations options in Islamorada, including
camping, guesthouses, bed-and-breakfast inns, and resorts.
Unless otherwise noted, all listings include air-conditioning, televisions, a
pool, and free parking. As with much of coastal Florida, winter (Dec–Apr)
is peak season. Also, remember to add an additional 11.5 percent room
tax to your hotel rate.

Cheeca Lodge
$$–$$$$
Islamorada
Opened in 1949, the lodge remains one of the better places to turn out the
lights in the Keys. Located on 27 acres of beachfront property (the 1,100-
foot palm-lined beach is truly idyllic), this rambling resort is known for its
excellent sports facilities, including one of the only golf courses in the
Upper Keys. All rooms are spacious and have small balconies. For adults,
there’s the state-of-the-art Avanyu health spa and fitness center, and for
kids, their own customized vacation with Camp Cheeca’s organized activ-
ities and events. Most recently the lodge added brand-new beach bunga-
lows with private balconies.

Holiday Isle Resort
$$–$$$$
Islamorada
One of the biggest resorts in the Keys, the Holiday Isle attracts a spring-
break kind of crowd year-round. The huge complex encompasses five
restaurants, several lounges, a large marina, many retail shops, and four
distinct (if not distinctive) hotels. Its Tiki Bar claims to have invented the
rumrunner drink (151-proof rum, blackberry brandy, banana liqueur,
grenadine, and lime juice), and there’s no reason to doubt it. Hordes of
partiers are attracted to the resort’s nonstop merrymaking, live music, and
beachfront bars. As a result, some of the accommodations can be noisy.
Rooms can be bare-bones budget to oceanfront luxury, as the broad range
of prices reflects. Even the nicest rooms could use a good cleaning. El
Captain and Harbor Lights, two of the least-expensive hotels on the prop-
erty, are both austere. Like the other hotels here, rooms could use a thor-
ough rehab. Howard Johnson’s, another Holiday Isle property, is a little
farther from the action and a tad more civilized. If you plan to stay a few
days, choose an efficiency or a suite; both have kitchenettes.

The Moorings
$$$–$$$$$
Islamorada
Staying at The Moorings is more like residing at a secluded beach house
than at a hotel. You’ll never see another soul on this 18-acre resort if you
choose not to. There isn’t even maid service unless you request it. The
romantic whitewashed units, from cozy cottages to three-bedroom houses,

Islamorada
This small oceanfront property’s 11 units are spread out along more than
half a dozen gorgeous, grassy waterfront acres. All are immaculately clean
and comfortable, and most are outfitted with full kitchens and tasteful fur-
nishings. There’s no bar, restaurant, or staff to speak of, but the retreat’s
affable owner, Jackie Barnes, is happy to lend you bicycles or good advice
on the area’s offerings. A large dock attracts boaters and a good variety of
local and migratory birds.

Dining locally
Seafood isn’t the only show in town, but passing up the chance to have it
so fresh is a shame. Also, if you want to increase your dining choices,
shop for restaurants in Key Largo, which is discussed earlier in this
chapter, and Marathon, coming up a bit later. Don’t forget: All Florida
restaurants and food-serving bars are smoke-free.
Alabama Jack’s

Key Largo
SEAFOOD
On its own, there’s not much to the waterfront shack that is Alabama
Jack’s. The bar serves beer and wine only, and the restaurant specializes
in delicious, albeit, greasy bar fare. But this quintessential Old Floridian
dive, located in a historic fishing village called Card Sound, located between
Homestead and Key Largo, is a colorful must on the drive south, especially
on Sundays, when bikers mix with line dancers and Southern belles who
look as if they just got off the Hee Haw set in all their fabulous frill.

Islamorada
SEAFOOD
The original Islamorada Fish Company has been selling seafood out of its
roadside shack since 1948. It’s still the best place to pick up a cooler of
stone crab claws in season (mid-Oct–Apr). Also great are the fried-fish
sandwiches, served with melted American cheese, fried onions, and
coleslaw. A few hundred yards up the road (at MM 81.6) is Islamorada Fish
Company Restaurant & Bakery, a newer establishment. Although it looks
like an average diner, it serves fantastic seafood and pastas. It’s also the
place for breakfast. Locals gather for politics and gossip as well as deli-
cious grits, oatmeal, omelets, and homemade pastries.

Key Largo
SEAFOOD
This big old fish house and bar with the massive mermaid sign out front
is a great place for a snack, a meal, or a beer. Excellent views of the bay
remind you that you are in a very primitive, pristine form of civilization.
Inside, a good-value menu focuses mainly on seafood. When in season, lob-
sters are the way to go. For $20, you can get a good-size tail — at least a 
1 pounder — prepared any way you like. Other fare includes the standard
clam chowder, fried shrimp, and doughy conch fritters. The outside bar

from a limited menu that is satisfying and well priced.

Exploring Islamorada
Islamorada is a small, but splashy hub for water sports, diving, and
boating.
Lignumvitae Key State Botanical Site
Lignumvitae Key
If you want to see the Keys as they used to be, head for this 280-acre island,
which you can only get to by boat. But Lignumvitae (named after a rare
tree) is worth a trip. In addition to its namesakes, this place is home to
mahogany, strangler fig, and gumbo-limbo trees. The lush hammocks also
shelter several bird species, but bring mosquito repellent. Because of a
limit on visitors, call ahead for reservations. Due to the ferry schedule, it’s
a half-day event.
See map p. 130. Leave from Robbie’s Pier, MM 77.5 (see the next entry). %305-664-9814.
www.abfla.com/parks/LignumvitaeKey/lignumvitaekey.html. To get
there: Look for the Hungry Tarpon sign, just past the Indian Key channel. Admission:
Robbie’s runs a ferry twice a day (9:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m.; arrive 30 min. before depar-
ture time) for $15 per person. Reservations are a good idea. Open: Dawn till dusk.
Robbie’s Pier
Islamorada
One of the best — and definitely one of the cheapest — attractions in the
Upper Keys is the famed Robbie’s Pier. Here, the fierce steely tarpons, a
prized catch for backcountry anglers, have been gathering for the past 
20 years. You may recognize these prehistoric-looking giants that grow up
to 200 pounds; many are displayed as trophies and mounted on local
restaurant walls. But here at Robbie’s Pier, they’re alive, and tens and
sometimes hundreds of these behemoths circle the shallow waters wait-
ing for you to feed them a $2 bucketful of fish. Kayak tours promise an even
closer glimpse. Allow an hour if you come early or late.
See map p. 130. U.S. 1 at MM 77.5 (oceanside). % 305-664-9814. www.robbies.com.
To get there: Under Hungry Tarpon sign just past Indian Key channel. Admission: $1
(free if you take the Lignumvitae ferry). Open: Daily 8 a.m.–5 p.m. 
Theater of the Sea
Islamorada
Established in 1946, the Theater of the Sea is one of the world’s oldest
marine zoos. Recently refurbished, with newly paved walkways, land-
scaping, and an on-site photo service, the park’s dolphin and sea lion

140

shows are entertaining and informative, especially for children, who will
also love seeing the sharks, sea turtles, and tropical fish. If you want to
swim with dolphins and you haven’t booked well in advance, you may be
able to get in with just a few hours, or days, notice as opposed to the more
rigid Dolphin Research Center in Marathon. Expect to spend two hours
here (three if you do the swim).

Pursuing outdoor delights
If you’re a skipper, you can rent a boat and chart your course from
Robbie’s Pier, located on U.S. 1/Overseas Highway at MM 77.5. (% 305-
664-9814; www.robbies.com), where 16- to 18-footers rent for $70 to $205
half-day, $90 to $295 full-day. Rental Boat Company at Bud N’ Mary’s
Marina (% 305-664-0091) has outdoor and pontoon boat rentals for $100
to $160 per half-day and $140 to $300 for a full day. 
The diving magnet for this region is a sunken Spanish galleon, The Eagle,
dating to 1733. Little is left, but the galleon is still a favorite of divers.
Curators have added many authentic touches, including seven concrete
cannon replicas and a ship’s anchor from the 18th century. The ship,
nearly a football field long in 110 feet of water, is a magnet for grouper,
tarpon, and jack.
The Holiday Isle Dive Shop, 84001 Overseas Hwy. (% 305-664-DIVE;
www.diveholidayisle.com), is a full-service PADI shop with daily dive
trips and private or group instruction. Snorkel and dive prices range
from $10 to $55. Instruction runs from $165 to $495.
The rod-and-reel crowd will find catching bonefish, tarpon, and marlin a
thrill. Plus, grouper, yellowtail snapper, and mahimahi make great meals.
Inshore rates are generally $225 a half-day, $400 for eight hours; double
that for deep-sea excursions. Robbie’s Pier, 84500 U.S. 1/Overseas Hwy.
(% 877-664-8498 or 305-664-9814; www.robbies.com) and Reef Runner,
176 Coral Rd. (% 305-852-3660), are two reliable outfitters and offer a
number of expeditions.
Living it up after dark
You haven’t lived until you’ve experienced Big Dick and the Extenders at
Woody’s Saloon and Restaurant, MM 81.5 (% 305-664-4335). Big is a
large, often profane Native American whose shtick is particularly stinging
if you climb into a front table. His band takes the stage at about 10 p.m.
and holds court until 4 a.m., Wednesday through Saturday. Dick appears
in time for an adult comedy show at 11 p.m. The Lorelei Restaurant,
MM 82 (% 305-664-4338), features nightly guitar and other music at its
Cabana Bar. The restaurant is open from 6 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. daily; the
bar stays open until 2 a.m. 
Chapter 11: Unlocking the Keys 141

Marathon
Marathon is another sleepy hollow where motels are a bit thin, and
restaurants are thinner. But there’s a bright side: Marathon has one of
the better dolphin-swim programs. See “Exploring Marathon,” later in
this chapter for further details.
Spending the night
Marathon, in the heart of the Keys, offers the modern conveniences of a
bustling commercial community and has a number of resort hotels. Even
though Marathon is growing, it still retains its 19th-century fishing-village
charm, so you’ll also find some guesthouses and bed-and-breakfasts.
Unless otherwise noted, all listings include air-conditioning, televisions, a
pool, and free parking. As with much of coastal Florida, winter (Dec–Apr)
is peak season. And don’t forget to add an additional 11.5 percent room
tax to your hotel rate.
Banana Bay Resort & Marina
$$–$$$
Marathon
It doesn’t look like much from the sign-cluttered Overseas Highway, but
when you enter the lush grounds of Banana Bay, you’ll realize you’re in
one of the most bucolic and best-run properties in the Upper Keys. Built
in the early 1950s as a place for fishermen to stay during extended fishing
trips, the resort is a beachfront maze of two-story buildings hidden among
banyans and palms. The rooms are moderately sized, and many have pri-
vate balconies where you can enjoy your complimentary coffee and news-
paper every morning. Recent additions to the hotel include a recreational
activity area with horseshoe pits, a bocce court, picnic areas with barbe-
cue grills, and a giant lawn chessboard. The hotel’s kitschy restaurant
serves three meals a day, indoors or poolside. A surprising amenity is
Pretty Joe Rock, the hotel’s private island, which is available for long week-
ends and weekly rentals. The island has a Keys-style two-bedroom, two-
bathroom cottage that’s ideal for romantic escapes (contact the resort for
rates). This resort is family-friendly, but if you’re looking for an adults-only
resort, there’s also a Banana Bay Resort in Key West (% 305-296-6925)
that doesn’t allow children.

Hawk’s Cay Resort
$$$$
Duck Key/Marathon
Located on its own 60-acre island in the Middle Keys, this resort has a
relaxed and casual island atmosphere. If it’s recreation you’re looking for,
Hawk’s Cay is far superior to the more luxurious Cheeca Lodge. It offers an
impressive array of activities — sailing, fishing, snorkeling, and water-
skiing, to name a few — plus the opportunity to swim in a special pool with
dolphins. (You need to reserve the dolphin swim well in advance — there’s
a waiting list.) Large and recently renovated, rooms feature island-style
furniture; each accommodation opens onto a private balcony with ocean
or tropical views (pricing varies depending on the view). The large bath-
rooms are well appointed and have granite countertops. You can also book
one of the hyper posh villas — there are 295 of them — with full kitchen,
washer/dryer, and living rooms with water or garden views modeled after
the kitschy 1950s concept of the “boatel.” The 7,000-square-foot Indies Spa
offers stellar treatments and a blissful Eucalyptus steam room that’ll clear
even the most stubborn of sinuses. In addition to a lagoon and several
pools for families, the resort boasts a secluded pool for adults only.
Organized children’s activities, including special marine- and ecologically
inspired programs, will keep your little ones busy while you relax.

Dining locally
As in the rest of the Keys, the cuisine in Marathon revolves around
seafood. Fish, crabs, lobsters, and scallops are your best bets, although
you’ll also find basic burgers, poultry, and the like. If you want to increase
your dining options, you can also look for places to eat in nearby
Islamorada and the Lower Keys, which are also discussed in this chapter.
Remember: All Florida restaurants and food-serving bars are smoke-free.
Barracuda Grill
$$
Marathon
BISTRO/SEAFOOD
This small, casual spot serves excellent seafood, steaks, and chops, but
unfortunately, it’s only open for dinner. Some of the favorite dishes are the
Caicos gold conch, and mangrove snapper and mango. Try the Tipsy
Olives appetizer, marinated in gin or vodka, to kick-start your meal. Fans

of spicy food should try the red-hot calamari. Decorated with barracuda-
themed art, the restaurant also features a well-priced American wine list
with lots of California vintages.

indoors or out.

The options here are lean in terms of numbers, but Marathon will help
you discover your inner Flipper at its famous Dolphin Research Center.
If you want to take a tour of the area, Latigo Yacht Charters, in the
Marathon Marina, 1021 11th St. (% 305-289-1066; www.latigo.net)
offers several excursions aboard a 56-foot motor yacht, including a
“bed-and-breakfast cruise” ($490 per couple) that includes dinner, beer,
wine, champagne, breakfast, and snorkeling.
Crane Point Hammock
Marathon
This is a little-known but worthwhile stop, especially for those interested
in the rich botanical and archaeological history of the Keys. Privately
owned, the 64-acre nature area contains what is probably the last virgin
thatch-palm hammock in North America as well as a rain-forest exhibit and
an archaeological dig site with pre-Columbian and prehistoric Bahamian
artifacts. Allow three to four hours.
Also headquarters for the Florida Keys Land and Sea Trust, the hammock’s
impressive nature museum has simple, informative displays of the Keys’
wildlife, including a walk-through replica of a coral-reef cave and life-size
dioramas with tropical birds and Key deer. Here, kids can participate in
art projects, see 6-foot-long iguanas, climb through a scaled-down pirate
ship, and touch a variety of indigenous aquatic and landlubbing creatures.

Dolphin Research Center
Marathon
This is number one: No other dolphin experience is as organized and
informative. The center’s primary goal is caring for the animals, and sev-
eral experiences are interactive. Dolphin Encounter, the hands-down
favorite, allows you to swim with bottlenose beauties. The cost is $155 for
ages 5 and older; reservations and English comprehension are required.
Dolphin Splash lets you get in the door without a dolphin swim. The price
is $80, kids under 3 get in free. Hands on Training puts you behind the
scenes to see training techniques and touch a dolphin. The cost is $50.
Guided tours can also give you the basics about the mammals. Allow two
to three hours.
A height requirement of 44 inches is enforced, and an adult must hold up
children under the required height.
See map p. 130. U.S. 1 at MM 59 (bayside; look for the 30-foot dolphin statue). % 305-

9:30 a.m.–4 p.m.
Seven-Mile Bridge
Marathon
The bridge is not your typical tourist attraction, but you can’t avoid a
peek. It takes nine minutes to cross, and there’s nothing else to do but
gawk and marvel. Opened in 1982, the architectural wonder cost $45 mil-
lion. Its crowning achievement is the fact that the Seven-Mile Bridge apex
is the highest point in the Keys. Some people may recognize the remnants
of the old bridge from the Arnold Schwarzenegger film True Lies. Don’t
worry that a wrong turn may lead you onto the old bridge instead of the
new one. The old span is closed to cars and has been transformed into the
world’s longest fishing pier, also used for hiking and watching the sunset.
See map p. 130. Between MMs 40 and 47. To get there: It’s south of Marathon. 
Outdoor pursuits
Boaters should try R&R Watersports, 13201 U.S. 1/Overseas Hwy. 
(% 305-743-9385; www.rrwatersports.com), which rents pontoons
($100–$140 for a half-day) and WaveRunners ($75 per hour).
Popular diving sites include the Adelaide Baker, a wrecked steamer
whose twin stacks lie in 25 feet of water; Thunderbolt, a 188-foot wreck
at a depth of 115 feet; and Coffin’s Patch, a series of six reefs brimming
with coral and fish.
Prices vary by outfitter, but snorkel tours usually begin at $25 and dive
tours at $60. Marathon’s charter fleet includes Marathon Divers, 12221
U.S. 1/Overseas Hwy. (% 800-724-5798 or 305-289-1141), and Capt.
Chapter 11: Unlocking the Keys 145

Hook’s Marina & Dive Centers, 11833 U.S. 1/Overseas Hwy. (% 800-278-
4665).
As in the rest of the Keys, the fish are always biting in Marathon. Thanks
to offshore depths that reach up to 1,100 feet, this area has more than its
share of blue and white marlin, mako shark, and blackfin tuna; you’ll also
find many common in-shore species. Local charters include The Bounty
Hunter, 15th Street at Burdine’s Marina, Marathon (% 305-743-2446),
which offers full- and half-day outings. For 28 years, Captain Brock
Hook’s huge sign has boasted, “no fish, no pay”: You’re guaranteed to
catch something, or your money back! Choose your prey from shark,
barracuda, sailfish, or whatever else is running. Prices are $400 for a
half-day, $500 for three-quarters of a day, and $600 for a full day. Rates
are for groups of no more than six people.
The Lower Keys
If you want to be near but not in the middle of zany Key West, the
Lower Keys is the place. Despite proximity to party central, Big Pine,
Summerland, and Sugarloaf Keys remain largely quiet and natural.
Spending the night
The 50 or so islands that make up the Lower Keys are largely undevel-
oped, with just a few small properties and one or two resorts — and no
national chains. Most accommodations here are vacation rental homes,
generally offering two- to three-bedroom units, some with oceanfront
views.
In the following listings, I only tell you about air-conditioning, pools, tele-
visions, and free parking if a property doesn’t have them. And, as always,
don’t forget to tack on the 11.5 percent room tax to your hotel rate.
If a back-to-nature experience appeals to you, the area also offers some
great camping. Bahia Honda State Recreation Area (see the listing for
the park, later in this chapter), which features 80 camping sites, is
loaded with facilities and outdoor activities. A site costs $26 for a maxi-
mum of four people and includes electricity. Cabins hold up to eight
people. Equipped with linens, kitchenettes, and utensils, the cabins run
from $50 to $110 depending on the season. For more information, or to
reserve a site, call % 305-872-2353.
Deer Run Bed and Breakfast

ably furnished with queen-size beds, good closets, and touch-sensitive
lamps. Rattan and 1970s-style chairs and couches furnish the living room,

along with 13 birds and 3 cats. Breakfast, which is served on a pretty,
fenced-in porch, is cooked to order by Sue herself. The wooded area
around the property is full of Key deer, which often wander the beach as
well. There’s no pool, but a hot tub overlooking the ocean is especially
nice. Ask to use one of the bikes to explore nearby nature trails.

Little Palm Island
$$$$
Little Torch Key
This exclusive island escape — host to presidents and royalty — is not
just a place to stay while in the Lower Keys; it is a destination all its own.
Built on a private 5-acre island, it’s accessible only by boat. Guests stay in
thatched-roof duplexes amid lush foliage and flowering tropical plants.
Many villas have ocean views and private sundecks with rope hammocks.
Inside, the romantic suites have all the comforts and conveniences of a
luxurious contemporary beach cottage but without telephones, TVs, or
alarm clocks. As if its location weren’t idyllic enough, a new full-service
spa recently opened on the island. Note that on the breezeless south side
of the island, mosquitoes can be a problem, even in the winter, so bring
bug spray and lightweight, long-sleeved clothing. Leave kids under 16 at
home — they’d be bored here anyway.

Parmer’s Resort
$–$$
Little Torch Key
A fixture for more than 20 years, Parmer’s is well known for its charming
hospitality and helpful staff. This downscale resort offers modest but com-
fortable cottages, each of them unique. Some are waterfront, many have
kitchenettes, and others are just a bedroom. Room 26 (also known as
Wahoo), a one-bedroom efficiency, is especially nice, with a small sitting
area that faces the water. Room 6, a small efficiency, has a kitchenette and
an especially large bathroom. Recently updated, rooms are consistently
very clean. Many can be combined to accommodate large families. The
hotel’s waterfront location almost makes up for the fact that you must pay
extra for maid service.

Dining locally
Unfortunately, the Lower Keys don’t have many dining options. Aside
from the following eateries, your best restaurant bet is to try the one
with the most cars parked in front of it. Don’t forget: All Florida restau-
rants and food-serving bars are smoke-free.
I can tell you from experience that if a storm rears up during hurricane
season, every establishment shuts up tight. You may want to keep a few
snacks in your room.
Coco’s Kitchen
$
Big Pine Key
CUBAN/NICARAGUAN
This tiny storefront has been dishing out black beans, rice, and shredded
beef to fans of Cuban cuisine for more than ten years. The owners, who
are actually from Nicaragua, cook not only superior Cuban food but also
some local specialties, as well as Italian and Caribbean dishes. Favorites
include fried shrimp, whole fried yellowtail, and Cuban-style roast pork
(available only on Sat). The best bet is the daily special, which may be
roasted pork or fresh grouper, served with rice and beans or salad and
crispy fries. Top off the huge, cheap meal with a rich caramel-soaked flan.

Open: Mon–Sat 7 a.m–7:30 p.m.
The Dining Room at Little Palm Island
$$$$
Little Palm Island
FRENCH/FLORIBBEAN
If you aren’t keeping track of your dining budget, go dressy casual, grab
the island ferryboat, and head to this resort restaurant. Choose from a
menu that leans toward French and Floribbean (that’s Florida and
Caribbean flavors colliding). The menu changes, but it may include pan-
seared snapper with lobster dumplings, crab cakes with vegetables, or
roast chicken in a tarragon-Riesling sauce. The wine list is extensive.

Monte’s

Summerland Key
SEAFOOD
Certainly nobody goes to this restaurant/fish market for its atmosphere:
Plastic place settings rest on plastic-covered picnic-style tables in a screen-
enclosed dining patio. But Monte’s doesn’t need great atmosphere because
it has survived for more than 20 years on its very good and incredibly fresh
food. The day’s catch may include shark, tuna, lobsters, stone crabs, or
shrimp.

Exploring the Lower Keys
This is outdoorsville — the place to be if you want to commune with
nature in a tranquil and relatively unspoiled setting. Unlike their neigh-
bors to the north and Key West to the south, the Lower Keys are devoid
of spring-break crowds and have little nightlife. Unless you drive to Key
West, you won’t even be able to find a tourist trap.
Bahia Honda State Recreation Area
Big Pine Key
The only state park in the Lower Keys, Bahia Honda also has the only nat-
ural beach in the entire chain. Its 524 acres are made of dunes, coastal
mangroves, and hammocks. The white-sand beach has deep water close to
shore, making this venue good for diving and snorkeling. (You may find
starfish floating only 3 feet below the surface of the water.) Snorkel trips
to Looe Key Reef depart two to three times daily, and the cost is $24.95 for
adults, $19.95 for kids under 18, and $5 for equipment rental. (See Looe
Key National Marine Sanctuary later in this chapter under “Taking it to the
water.”) While you’re here, climb aboard what’s left of Henry Flagler’s rail
line and treat yourself to a panorama of the nearby keys. For information
about camping here, see “Spending the night” in the section “The Lower
Keys, “ earlier in this chapter.

snorkeling trips, call % 305-872-3210. www.bahiahondapark.com. Reservations
recommended for snorkeling. Admission: $5 per couple and 50¢ for each additional
person. Open: Daily 8 a.m.–sunset.
National Key Deer Refuge
Big Pine Key
Key deer — no larger than medium-sized dogs — are making a last stand
on this isle. Due to pollution, vanishing habitats, and speeding cars, only
300 deer are left. The deer sanctuary has a marked trail (Watson
Hammock) where you may get a glimpse of a deer if you come early or late
Chapter 11: Unlocking the Keys 149

in the day. Important note: Please don’t feed the deer — the animals’ tiny
bodies aren’t built for people food.
See map p. 130. No address. % 305-872-2239. To get there: Weekdays, go to the
ranger station at MM 30.5 in the Winn-Dixie plaza. Otherwise, go to Big Pine Key’s
lone traffic light and take Key Deer Boulevard back, then take the left fork. Admission:
free. Open: The ranger station is open Mon–Fri 8 a.m.–5 p.m. The refuge is open daily,
during daylight hours.
Taking it to the water
Divers will find that the Looe Key National Marine Sanctuary, located
off Bahia Honda State Recreation Area (see earlier information and map
p. 130) boasts dramatic reefs due to a ban on spear fishing as well as
coral and shell collecting. You can see barracuda, tarpon, and moray
eels at a depth of less than 35 feet, and some of the marine life swims
right up to your mask. Prices begin at $35 for snorkelers and $45 for
divers. Looe Key Reef Resort and Dive Center, U.S. 1/Overseas
Highway, at MM 27.5, Ramrod Key (% 305-872-2215), is one of the
area’s better diving operators.
Fishermen love a fight. The Keys’ favorite contenders are bonefish
(3–15 pounds), tarpon (usually 40–50 pounds but as big as 200), and
permit (up to 25 pounds). Back Country Guide Service, 472 Sands Rd.,
Big Pine Key (% 800-663-5780 or 305-872-9528) charges $275 per half-
day and $375 for a full day aboard an 18-footer with little sun relief.
Grouch Charters, MM 24.5, Summerland Key (% 305-745-1172), takes
$350 for four people per half-day, and $475 for a full day on an offshore
boat.
Key West
Paradise? That may be stretching things when you describe Key West.
There’s traffic, prices are high, it’s hot, the decibel level can split an oak,
and franchises have usurped Hemingway’s hideaway. Did I mention that
cruise ships dock here?
But Key West does combine some of the natural treasures of the Keys
(fishing and other water sports) with some of the rum-and-then-some
fun of a destination that also has bars, restaurants, weird shows, and
weirder people. (See an overview of “Key West” coming up.) And the gay
lifestyle of many residents and tourists is openly accepted, which makes
Key West one of the more progressive cities east of the Mississippi.
The island is small, and there are enough transportation options that you
won’t need a car, unless you’re planning on touring some of the other
Keys. Taxis from the airport to town run $3.50 to $7 per person for two or
more, depending on your destination. Five Sixes Taxi (% 305-296-6666)
and Friendly Cab Co. (% 305-295-5555) are two of the regulars. Rates
are $2 for the first 0.2 mile and 50¢ for each additional 0.2 mile.

Key West
Although Key West is a tiny island, it’s broken up into four distinct
“neighborhoods”: Old Town, South Beach, the Port Area, and North End.
Old Town is where you’ll find most of the mainstream hotels, restau-
rants, bars, and, of course, Duval Street. North of Duval Street is the
aptly named North End, where you’ll find the best sunsets in the world
and famous Mallory Square. On the Atlantic side of Old Town is South
Beach, named for its location at the southern end of Duval Street. It is
exactly what it says it is — a beach. The Port Area, officially known as
the Historic Seaport at Key West Bight, is located east on Caroline Street.
What you’ll find there besides boats are restaurants and, yes, bars. 

Key West’s downtown parking and traffic are annoying, however, so your
best bet for getting around may lie on two wheels. If you’re staying in
Key West, consider renting a bike (from $8 a day and $30 a week) or
moped ($30 and $100, respectively) from Moped Hospital, 601 Truman
Ave. (% 305-296-3344). Tropical Bicycles & Scooters, 1300 Duval St.
(% 305-294-8136), rents bikes for $8 a day and $40 a week; scooters are
$29 and $129, respectively.
Spending the night
Here’s a city with a melting-pot character that permits a large, liberal base
to mingle with crusty natives, called Conchs (pronounced konks), and
with Miami wheeler-dealers. The wealth of places to stay in Key West
ranges from bed-and-breakfasts to hotel chains and upscale resorts.
Vacation Key West (% 800-595-5397 or 305-295-9500; www.vacationkw.
com) is a hotel reservation service that can often get you discounts of 
20 to 30 percent at some of the major chains on the island and also offers
car-rental discounts. They also represent a few guesthouses.
Keep in mind that prices skyrocket during the holidays, high season
(Dec–Apr), and for the island’s special events. Reserve well in advance
because rooms become scarce and many places require minimum stays.
Unless otherwise noted, all listings include air-conditioning, televisions,
a pool, and free parking. Key West assesses an additional hotel tax of
11.5 percent, so budget for this when selecting your accommodations.
The Gardens Hotel
$$$–$$$$
Key West/Old Town
Once a private residence, The Gardens Hotel is hidden amidst the exotic
Peggy Mills tropical botanical gardens. What lies behind the gardens is 
a luxurious, Bahamian-style hideaway featuring 17 lavishly appointed
accommodations including two suites, two historic rooms in the main
house (which is listed in the National Register of Historic Places), 12 garden
and courtyard rooms, and one uber secluded cottage. A gorgeous freeform
swimming pool is right in the middle of the courtyard, with an adjacent tiki
bar to serve up whatever libation you desire. Winding brick pathways lead-
ing to secluded seating areas in the private gardens make for an idyllic
romantic getaway that’s the quintessence of paradise.

Dining locally
You can find a tempting array of food choices on Key West, with many dif-
ferent cuisines represented. If your tastes run more toward food of the fast
variety, many national chains have franchises along Roosevelt Boulevard.
Fresh fish and seafood, as in the rest of Florida, are usually your best bets
on a menu, and don’t visit here without trying a slice of authentic Key lime
pie. Note: Quality Key lime pie will be pale yellow, not green.
Restaurants, for the most part, offer a relaxed and casual atmosphere.
Many offer outdoor dining so patrons can get a good look at the Key West
sunsets. Note, however, that many don’t offer on-site parking, and don’t
forget that all Florida restaurants and food-serving bars are smoke-free.
Banana Cafe

Key West/Old Town

Like many of Key West’s restaurants, this eatery is situated in a century-
old house that was built near the end of the island’s maritime heyday. The
entrees include sliced duck breast in green peppercorn sauce; rack of lamb
in sautéed apples and Madeira wine sauce; and shrimp, mussels, scallops,
and fish in Provençal tomato sauce served over saffron fettuccine. A jazz
band plays here on Thursday nights.

Key West/Old Town
CARIBBEAN
This little hippie-run gallery and restaurant has become the place to be in
Key West — and with good reason. Be prepared to wait in line. The food
here is some of the best in town, especially for breakfast. You can enjoy
homemade granola, huge tropical-fruit pancakes, and seafood Benedict.
Dinners are just as good and run the gamut from fresh-caught fish dishes
to Jamaican-style jerk chicken, curried soups, and vegetarian stews. But if
you’re a neat freak, don’t bother. Some people are put off by the dirt floors
and roaming cats and birds, but frankly, it adds to the charm.

Nestled amid blooming bougainvillea on a lush slice of the Gulf, Louie’s

Norman Van Aiken of Norman’s in Miami brought his talents farther south
and started what has become one of the finest dining spots in the Keys.
As a result, this is one of the hardest places to score a reservation: Either
call way in advance or hope that your hotel concierge has some pull. After
dinner, sit at the dockside bar and watch the waves crash, almost touch-
ing your feet, while enjoying a cocktail at sunset.

ITALIAN
Locals appreciate that they can get good, inexpensive food here in a town
filled with tourist traps. Off the beaten track, in a little corner storefront,
this great Chicago-style pasta place serves some of the best Italian food in
the Keys. The family-run restaurant offers superb homemade pastas of
every description, including one of the tastiest marinaras around. The
simple grilled chicken breast brushed with olive oil and sprinkled with
pepper is another good choice, as is the Picadillo Pasta — black-bean
pasta shells smothered in a Cuban-inspired sauce with meat, tomatoes,
olives, capers, and spices. You wouldn’t know it from the glossy glass-front
room, but there’s a fantastic little outdoor patio dotted with twinkling
pepper lights and lots of plants.

SEAFOOD
Simple, good food is Seven Fish’s motto, but this hidden little secret is
much more than simple. One of the most popular locals’ restaurants,
Seven Fish is a chic seafood spot serving some of the best fish dishes on
the entire island. Crab and shiitake mushroom pasta, seafood pasta, sea
scallops, fish of the day, and gnocchi with blue cheese and sautéed fish
are among the dishes to choose from. Try the tropical shrimp salsa for
starters, and for dessert, don’t miss the Key lime cake over tart lime curd
with fresh berries. Be sure to make reservations well in advance, as seat-

scallops, and fish in a garlic-and-tomato sauce), grilled chicken enchiladas,

order them. They’re fantastic and not nearly as exorbitantly priced as they
are up in Miami. Blues bands play here on most nights.

Exploring Key West 
In addition to the attractions mentioned here, Key West throws two grand
parties (and nightly mini ones) during the year. The first is Hemingway
Days (% 305-294-4440; www.hemingwaydays.com), which is held each
July and includes festivities ranging from Papa look-alike contests to a
fishing tournament and literary events. Fantasy Fest (% 305-296-1817;
www.fantasyfest.net) covers the ten days leading up to Halloween.
Activities include balls, parades, a celebrity look-alike contest, and beach
and toga parties.
Now, on with the rest of the show.
Audubon House & Tropical Gardens
Key West/Old Town
Painter and bird fancier John James Audubon didn’t own the place, but he
spent a few nights here in 1832. Rare Audubon prints and antiques are
joined by a self-guided audio tour that takes about 30 minutes. You can
also wander the grounds, which contain orchid and herb gardens.

house dates to 1851, 80 years before the author landed. Descendants of

Key West Cemetery
Key West/Old Town
As strange and crowded as the city it serves, this final resting place under-
scores the notion that Key Westers keep their senses of humor even in
death. Epitaphs include such parting thoughts as: “His beautiful little spirit
was a challenge to love,” for a Yorkshire terrier buried beside his mistress;
“Now I know where he’s sleeping at night,” for a wayward husband deserv-
ing a proper send-off from his wife; “I told you I was sick,” for a woman
who apparently had trouble getting her friends and physician to listen; and
“The buck stops here,” for a native whose spirit pretty much epitomizes
the local lifestyle. Allow one to three hours depending on your interest 
in the dead.
See map p. 151. At Margaret and Angela streets. % 305-294-8380 for tours.
Admission: Free; 90-minute tours are $20. Open: Daily dawn to dusk.
Mel Fisher Maritime Heritage Museum
Key West/Old Town
The namesake treasure hunter has gone to that great salvage yard in the
sky, but his life’s work remains on display. Exhibits include some of the
treasure he recovered from shipwrecked Spanish galleons, such as 
the Nuestra Senora de Atocha, which sank in 1622. Artifacts are priceless,
with gold and silver bars, jewels, and emeralds that would make Elizabeth
Taylor green with envy. This is a good stop if you’re into pirates and treas-
ure hunting. Most folks stay one to two hours.
See map p. 151. 200 Greene St. (at Whitehead Street). % 305-294-2633. www.mel
fisher.org/home.htm. Admission: $7.50 adults, $4 students, $3.75 kids under 6.
Open: Daily 9:30 a.m.–5 p.m.

Seeing Key West by guided tour
You can see Key West in an organized fashion in several ways. Sharon
Wells’ Biking & Walking Guide to Key West (% 305-294-8380; www.
seekeywest.com) offers plenty of touring choices in the $20 to $25 range.
Themes include architecture, the Key West Cemetery, and an island
overview.
The Conch Train (% 800-868-7482 or 305-296-6688) is one of two island
tours operated by Historic Tours of America. It’s tacky and touristy (a
Jeep disguised to look like a locomotive pulls you around), but enduring
this 90-minute special is almost required by the Tourists’ Honor Code.
The narrative (usually tongue-in-cheek) provides an overview of Key
West sights. Catch it at Mallory Square or the Welcome Center near U.S.
1/Overseas Highway and North Roosevelt; the tours depart every half-
hour from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. daily. The cost is $20 for adults, $10 for kids
between 4 and 12. The Old Town Trolley (% 800-868-7482 or 305-296-
6688) offers the same sort of humorous tours at the same prices, but
you can get off and reboard at any of the trolley’s 14 stops. Choose the
trolley if you’re staying at one of the hotels along the trolley route, or in
the case of bad weather — the Conch Train doesn’t have a roof.
Ghost Walk (% 305-294-9255; www.hauntedtours.com), is a 90-minute, 
1-mile hike through the city’s historic district offered by the Key West Tour
Association. The spooky but fun experience costs $20 for adults (you can
find $3-off coupons everywhere; if you can’t, the staff discounts the cost
anyway) and $10 (no discount) for kids 3 to 12. The tour leaves nightly at 
8 p.m. from the Holiday Inn La Concha at 430 Duval St., Old Town. Getting
there 15 minutes early is smart; so are day-before reservations.
Several local vessels offer short sightseeing excursions, and some go to
Fort Jefferson in nearby Dry Tortugas National Park. Known as the
“Gibraltar of the Gulf,” the fort was built in the mid-19th century to give
the United States control of navigation in the Gulf of Mexico. The walls are
8 feet thick and 50 feet high. Its main claim to fame, though, was as a Civil
War prison for the Union Army. The fort’s most famous inmate was Dr.
Samuel Mudd, the Maryland surgeon who unwittingly set the broken leg of
John Wilkes Booth, President Lincoln’s assassin. Today, it’s a favorite of
bird-watchers. (Tens of thousands of orioles, swallows, and terns pass
through each spring.) Divers and snorkelers may see leatherback, green,
and Atlantic Ridley sea turtles. For more information, call the National
Park Service (% 305-242-7700).
The catamaran Sunny Days (% 305-296-5556; www.sunnydayskeywest.
com) makes runs to the Dry Tortugas from its dock at the end of
Elizabeth and Greene streets (arrive by 7:30 a.m.). The 81⁄2-hour excursion
includes continental breakfast, lunch, soft drinks, snorkeling gear, and a
guided tour. The ride costs $100 for adults, $95 for seniors and students,
$70 for kids under 6. Yankee Freedom (% 800-926-5332 or 305-294-7009;
www.yankee-fleet.com) makes the same run from Key West Seaport,
240 Margaret St. The fare for this 100-foot catamaran is $125 for adults,
Part III: South Florida 
158

$115 for seniors and college students, and $83 for kids. The price
includes continental breakfast, lunch, snorkeling gear, and a tour.
The 130-foot, 1939 schooner Western Union (% 305-292-1766; www.
schoonerwesternunion.com) is the last tall ship built in Key West.
Berthed at Schooner Wharf, 202 William St., the schooner is used for
two-hour afternoon cruises ($44 per person, including beer, wine, and
champagne) and sunset sails ($65 per person, including beer, wine,
champagne, conch chowder, and live entertainment). The 74-foot
schooner Wolf (% 305-296-9694; www.schoonerwolf.com) sails from
201 Williams St. Its two-hour day-trips ($30 per person) include soda.
Sunset cruises ($40) include champagne, beer, soda, and music.
Seaplanes of Key West (% 800-950-2359 or 305-294-0709; www.seaplanes
ofkeywest.com) offers four- and eight-hour snorkeling/sightseeing excur-
sions to the Dry Tortugas National Park. Rates are $179 per half-day and
$305 for a full day, including snorkel equipment, sodas, and water. If you
want lunch, bring your own. It’s based out of Key West Airport.
Outdoor adventures
Key West continues the Florida Keys’ strong water-sports theme. Key
West also delivers the chain’s only legitimate golf course.
Diving and snorkeling
The southernmost city has several good sites for diving and snorkeling.
Resting 65 feet below the surface, Joe’s Tug is a good place to see moray
eels, barracudas, and jacks. At the Nine-Foot Stake reef you can
encounter soft coral and juvenile marine life at 10 to 25 feet.
At The Water’s Edge offers a reservations service (% 305-766-2240;
http://hometown.aol.com/doitallman/keywest.html). Local outfit-
ters include No Wake Charters, 201 William St., Key West (% 305-294-
3912; www.nowakecharters.com), which uses a 31-foot sailboat for pri-
vate half-day ($225 for two people) and full-day ($400 for two people)
charters. The trip includes round-trip transportation from your hotel.
Southpoint Divers, 714 Duval St. (% 800-891-3483 or 305-292-9778;
www.southpointdivers.com), offers two-tank scuba trips for $59 if you
have gear and $75 if you need to rent all your equipment.
Fishing
Bonefish, tarpon, and permit are some of the inshore fishing prizes.
Grouper and snapper are common on reefs or around wrecks. Marlin,
sailfish, blackfin tuna, wahoo, and dolphin are just a few of the creatures
lurking in the depths. Party-boat rates average about $40 for a full day;
charters that take four to six anglers are about $600.
Reservations can be arranged through At The Water’s Edge (see listing
under “Diving and snorkeling” above). You can also go straight to guides,
such as Key West Flats Fishing, 903 Eisenhower, at the Harborside Motel
Chapter 11: Unlocking the Keys 159

(% 305-294-7670; keywestflatsfishing.com), or Lethal Weapon
Charters, 245 Front St., at the Key West Hilton Resort & Marina (% 305-
296-6999; www.lethalweaponcharters.com).
There is a drought of good golfing in the Keys, but the Key West Golf
Club, 6450 E. College Rd., MM 4.5, and then turn on College Road (% 305-
294-5232; www.keywestgolf.com) can come to the rescue of desperate
duffers. This 6,526-yard 18-holer was designed by Rees Jones and is open
to the public. Mangroves and water spell many hazards. Greens fees are
$55 to $80 from June to October, $80 to $140 from November to May.
Keeping a bit of the Keys for yourself
If you fall in love with local seafood, you can bring favorites home from
Key West Seafood, 517 Duval St. (% 800-292-9853 or 305-292-4774; www.
keywestseafood.com). It ships fresh stone crab claws (Oct–May only),
lobster tails, shrimp, fish, and Key lime pie overnight. Nellie & Joe’s
(% 800-546-3743; www.keylimejuice.com) is Key West’s oldest and
best known bottler. Thirty years ago, the happy couple started pouring
Key-lime juice into longneck beer bottles and corking them. Today, the
selection also includes lemon juice and marinades. Although this whole-
saler doesn’t have its own storefront, you can find its products in local
stores, or you can order by phone or online. Peppers of Key West, 291
Front St. and 602 Greene St. (% 800-597-2823; www.peppersofkeywest.
com), has an exhaustive selection of hot sauces. The Saltwater Angler,
in the Hilton Resort & Marina at 243 Front St. (% 800-223-1629 or 305-
296-0700; www.saltwaterangler.com), features high-end fishing tackle
as well as tropical clothes and gear. In addition to the aforementioned
stores, most bars in town sell T-shirts and other trinkets bearing their
logos.
Living it up after dark
According to some folks, Captain Tony’s, 428 Greene St. (% 305-294-
1838), is the original Sloppy Joe’s of Hemingway’s novels. Even if it isn’t,
Capt. Tony’s is a delightful dive named for former owner/mayor Tony
Tarracino. Folks get so caught up in the action here that many leave
undergarments hanging from the ceiling.
The Hog’s Breath Saloon, 400 Front St. (% 800-826-6969 or 305-292-
2032; http://hogsbreath.com), comes with the motto: “Hog’s Breath Is
Better Than No Breath.” Like most of the town, the saloon is raucous
and sometimes raunchy. Expect such events as a homemade bikini con-
test where the combatants wear coconuts or water-filled plastic bags.
The reigning Sloppy Joe’s, 201 Duval St. (% 305-294-5717; www.sloppy
joes.com), has live music evenings and is often packed with tourists.
The atmosphere is mellower but possibly the most touristy at 
Jimmy Buffett’s Margaritaville, 500 Duval St. (% 305-292-1435; www.
margaritaville.com), where parrot heads (Buffett fans) down tasty
margaritas, but Jimmy doesn’t. He left the place to the tourists years
ago.

160

The Sunset Celebration at Mallory Square, behind the Clinton Street
Market at the west end of Duval (near the cruise-ship docks), happens
most days, even if it’s a bit overcast. One of the island’s most unusual
theaters, Sunset Celebration is a show where dwarfs juggle fruit, aging
hippies sing Janis Joplin’s songs (sometimes a little off-key), and some-
one always swallows a flaming sword or walks a high wire. The perform-
ance is free, though handouts are widely solicited. For more information
call % 305-292-7700 or surf over to http://sunsetcelebration.org.
Coming out to enjoy the gay scene
Key West has a very active gay and lesbian social scene. Some of the
best nightlife in town can be found in predominantly gay clubs that wel-
come anybody with an open mind. Aqua (% 305-292-8500) at 711 Duval
St., is the only real disco in town, playing eardrum-busting loud music
and featuring a colorful assortment of folks boogying down. One Saloon,
514 Petronia St. (% 305-294-9349), is another high-flying late-nighter
among male partygoers. The same goes for the 801 Bourbon Bar at 801
Duval (% 305-294-4737), where nightly drag shows redefine your ideals
of beauty. Considering the island’s popularity with gay and lesbian trav-
elers, it’s no wonder that Key West boasts a number of hotels that cater
specifically to gays and lesbians. Here are a few of the best in town:
 One of the city’s best known and respected inns, Alexander’s
Guest House, 1118 Fleming St. (% 800-654-9919 or 305-294-9919;
www.alexghouse.com; see map p. 151), has 17 rooms that have pri-
vate baths, cable TV, and refrigerators. Some have full kitchens,
verandas, and king-size beds. Rates at this award-winning guest-
house ($150–$300 Dec–Apr, $90–$180 Apr–Dec) include continental
breakfast (served poolside if the weather permits) and evening
cocktails.
 Pearl’s Rainbow, 525 United St. (% 800-749-6696 or 305-292-1450;
www.pearlsrainbow.com; see map p. 151), is among Key West’s
better establishments catering solely to women. It offers rooms and
suites, all with queen-size beds, TVs, telephones, and private baths.
Pearl’s Rainbow has two clothing-optional pools, a sun deck, and
two hot tubs. Rates ($99–$169 May–December, $159–$249 Dec–Apr)
include continental breakfasts.

T
here are no other Everglades in the world. They are, they have
always been, one of the unique regions of the earth, remote, never
wholly known. Nothing anywhere else is like them: their vast glittering
openness, wider than the enormous visible round of the horizon, the
racing free saltiness and sweetness of their massive winds, under the daz-
zling blue heights of space,” wrote the late Marjory Stoneman Douglas,
whose crusade to preserve and protect the swampy splendor earned her
the title of “mother of the Everglades.” Some people, however, didn’t think
this mother knew best, calling the Everglades a worthless swamp. They
were clearly wrong.
The Everglades, located just an hour’s drive from the madness of Miami,
are a magnet to naturalists, animal lovers, and those seeking peace and
quiet.
Introducing the Everglades
Highways, agricultural runoff, and other fingerprints of civilization have
partially destroyed Florida’s largest wetland. Plants and animals have
disappeared, the water has been poisoned, and habitats have been
turned into subdivisions.
But parts of the Everglades remain untouched, leaving this spot, at least
for now, primordial and unique. Everglades National Park is one of the
most beautiful wildernesses in the continental United States. The park is
basically a 40-mile-wide river, full of dense vegetation, which runs in super
slo-mo; a gallon of water takes nearly a month to move from one end to
the other. (Skip ahead to the map for an overview of “The Everglades.”)
High season for travel here is late November to May, when the weather is
relatively cooler and less humid.
“

Everglades National Park lies in the southernmost part of mainland
Florida, reaching from Everglades City on the west coast down to Cape
Sable and a state of mind called Flamingo. Then, the park goes along the
bottom of Florida to where the mainland gives way to the Keys. The
park’s supporting cast includes Big Cypress Swamp to the north and its
namesake national preserve, Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve, and
Collier-Seminole State Park. Combined, these four include the ancestral
homes of the Seminole and Miccosukee Indians and the last habitats for
scores of plant, tree, and animal species, including the Florida panther.
Although the area brims with natural wonders, it certainly is not a desti-
nation for everyone. But the Glades may be a good fit if you like places
where:
 TV, a rare commodity, gets fuzzy reception.
 If you can find a newspaper, the front-page headline may be “Mayor
Crowns Miss Speckled Perch.” 
 Bugs rule the day, the night, and the in between.
 Domino’s doesn’t deliver.
If these factors aren’t enough to discourage you, consider also that it’s
hot in the winter, the sun in this part of Florida can cause a nasty burn,
and bullfrogs’ pickup lines are one of the few forms of nightlife.
Did I mention kids? Most children marvel when they see eagles, mana-
tees, and river otters for the first time in the wild, but the magic wears
off for many youngsters when they discover that video games and thrill
rides (unless you consider the fact that airboat rides put virtual reality
games to shame) don’t exist here.
But if you consider all this and you’re still psyched, then welcome to the
Everglades!
Getting There
The Glades are just about as remote as Florida gets. Unless you come on a
see-Florida-by-bus tour, you’re going to need a rental car for the last leg 
of your journey. The best option is to fly into Miami (see Chapter 9 for 
airport information), rent a car, and then drive the 50 miles to the Glades.
To get there from the airport, take I-95 south to the Dolphin Expressway/
Highway 836; go west to the West Dade Expressway/Highway 821; then
south to U.S. 41/Tamiami Trail, and then head west.
You can attack from the west, but Southwest Florida International
Airport in Fort Myers is the only realistic landing zone (see Chapter 16
for more on the airport), and it’s 70 miles from the western fringe of the
Glades. If you opt for this route, after you’re on the ground, take I-75
south to Naples and then head west to the Glades.
Part III: South Florida 
164

Getting Around
Without an airboat, a car is the only way around the Glades. That said,
this is a wilderness region. Some of these roads, even the major high-
ways, can be pretty remote, and signs of civilization are few and far
between. A breakdown is the last thing you want to suffer on the more
remote roads, especially if you’re traveling at night. So have a solid plan
if you’re traveling by car. Don’t take chances with your gas level, and
skip the adventure routes or anything that could leave you stranded. My
advice: Carry a cellphone in case of an emergency. Reception in the
Glades is sketchy, but it’s better than nothing — there are no pay phones
in the area. Often, you can get a cellphone as an add-on to your rental
car, so ask at the rental agency (see Chapter 5 for more on car rentals).
Also, check — and then double-check — directions to activities, accom-
modations, and restaurants. Travel in daylight only. If a road looks suspi-
cious, find another route or activity.
Looking at a regional road map (see the “Maps” entry in “Fast Facts” at
the end of this chapter), you can see that straight paths from any given
Point A to Point B are often nonexistent. So, make sure you allow enough
time in your schedule. The major east–west roads are I-75/Alligator Alley
(north end) and U.S. 41/Tamiami Trail central. The north–south roads are
Highway 29 (west) and Highway 997 (east). Additionally, from Florida City
south of Miami, take Highway 9336 and follow the signs to Everglades
National Park and Ernest F. Coe Visitor Center. The highway continues
southwest to the Flamingo ranger station on the park’s south end. The
other entrances include Everglades City (west) at U.S. 41/Tamiami Trail
and Shark Valley (east) at U.S. 41/Tamiami Trail.
Staying in Style
Sparsely developed, the Everglades have only a meager smattering of
places to stay. You won’t find a Ritz-Carlton or even a Motel 6 here,
unless you opt to stay on the park’s outskirts. In addition to the follow-
ing listings, check out the hotels in Miami (see Chapter 9) and those in
Fort Myers and Naples (see Chapter 16) if you want more options. Also
see the campgrounds listed under “Exploring the Everglades,” later in
this chapter.

Everglades Vacation Rentals and Day Spa
$
Everglades City
This very cute bed-and-breakfast, formerly known as On the Banks of the
Everglades, is right on the money, as far as kitsch is concerned. It’s a fabu-
lous retreat from the lush greenery of the swampy Everglades to the even
more lush greenery of money. Located in a building that was formerly the
first bank established, in 1923, in Collier County, money is the premise this
inn founds itself on but doesn’t rob you of. A new day spa on the premises
provides all the necessary pampering after a long day exploring the swamps.

Flamingo Lodge and Marina
$–$$
Flamingo/Everglades National Park
If you want to commune with nature and stay inside the park, this resort
is your only choice. Its 74 motel units and 24 cottages overlook Florida
Bay. The cottages are larger and have kitchenettes, but they don’t offer tel-
evisions. Choose from a host of outdoor activities. In many ways, the
resort feels like a backwoods camp, and the scenery is great.

The Ivey House
$–$$
Everglades City
Housed in what used to be a recreational center for the men who built the
Tamiami Trail, the Ivey House offers three types of accommodations. In
the original house (now a B&B), there are ten small rooms that share
communal bathrooms (one each for women and men). One private cot-
tage consists of two bedrooms, a full kitchen, a private bath, and a
screened-in porch. The Ivey’s new inn (opened in 2001) adds 17 rooms
(with private bathrooms) that face a courtyard with a screened-in shallow
“conversation” pool. During the summer, however, the mosquitoes are out
in full force and a trip to the pool could leave you with multiple bites
(screens or not). Bring bug spray!

Rod & Gun Lodge
$$
Everglades City
Sitting on the banks of the sleepy Barron River, the Rod & Gun Lodge was
originally built as a private residence nearly 170 years ago, but Barron
Collier turned it into a cozy hunting lodge in the 1920s. President Harry S.
Truman flew in to sign Everglades National Park into existence in 1947 and
stayed over as well. Other guests have included President Richard Nixon,
Burt Reynolds, and Mick Jagger. But it’s no Four Seasons. This rustic, old
white clapboard house has plenty of history and all kinds of activities for
sports enthusiasts, including a swimming pool, bicycle rentals, a tennis
center, and nearby boat rentals and private fishing guides.

Dining Out
As with places to stay, the Glades offer relatively few dining choices. If
you’re after some diversity, consider some of the Miami (Chapter 9) or

SEAFOOD/STEAK
If you’re a seafood freak, this is a good place to chow down before or after
heading into the heart of the Everglades. Fresh marine cuisine, including
stuffed grouper, blackened snapper, and frog legs sautéed in garlic fill the
menu. You can also order steaks, chicken, and ribs. There’s a lunch buffet

Exploring the Everglades
If you missed my hints earlier, glitter and glitz aren’t expected to land in
the Glades’ region until Y3K. Just about everything to do in the Glades is
natural or relates to nature. Although there are more places here to visit
than most people realize, the headliner is Everglades National Park.

Top attractions
Everglades National Park
The park was dedicated by President Harry Truman in 1947, the same
year Marjory Stoneman Douglas immortalized this corner of the world in
her book, The Everglades: River of Grass. Douglas died in 1998 at 107,
after dedicating her life to saving the Glades.
The park remains one of the few natural places to see endangered
species such as American crocodiles, West Indian manatees, and, on an
incredibly rare evening or early morning, Florida panthers. Unfortunately,
many of the park’s creatures are in severe decline elsewhere — fewer
than 50 panthers are alive in the wild today — so a trip here may be
your only opportunity to catch a glimpse of this kind of wildlife.
Just the facts
Here’s all the information you’ll need about the park:
 Admission: It’s $10 per vehicle or $5 per person if you’re on a
motorcycle. Your admission pass is good for seven days. (Sorry,
there’s no shorter option.) Florida residents should consider get-
ting an annual Everglades Park Pass ($25), and U.S. citizens 62 and
over can snag a Golden Age Pass ($10) that’s good for life.
 Getting there: Some of the park’s northern reaches are accessible
off U.S. 41/Tamiami Trail and Highway 29. You can get to its eastern
and southern areas off State Road 9336, but much of the park has
no easy access.
 Information: Write to Everglades National Park, 40001 Hwy. 9336,
Homestead, FL 33034-6733 (% 305-242-7700; www.everglades.
national-park.com).
 Peak season: It runs from November through April.
 Ranger programs: More than 50 programs are conducted during
peak season, and cost nothing more than the standard park admis-
sion. Regular walking tours include Glades Glimpses, a 50-minute
outing discovering some of the area’s flora and fauna, and Anhinga
Ambles, a similar walking program that lasts 20 minutes. Check
ahead for schedules unless you want to do the miles of hiking and
biking trails on your own.
 Visitor centers: The park’s five naturalist- and ranger-staffed cen-
ters are:
• Ernest F. Coe Visitor Center (% 305-242-7700), located at
the main entrance to the park on Highway 9336, west of
Florida City. It’s open 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily.
• The Royal Palm Visitor Center (% 305-242-7700) is situated
4 miles west of the main entrance. It has a small nature
museum and is open daily from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Chapter 12: The Everglades 171

• The Flamingo Visitor Center (% 941-695-3311), located 
38 miles southwest of the main entrance on Highway 9336,
offers interactive nature displays and exhibits. It’s open daily
from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
• The Gulf Coast Visitor Center (% 941-695-3311), at the west-
ern entrance to the park, in Everglades City off Highway 29,
has exhibits on the local wildlife and offers information on
boat tours. It’s open daily from 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.
• The Shark Valley Visitor Center (% 305-221-8776), on U.S. 41/
Tamiami Trail, 15 miles west of Highway 997, is in the north-
ern reaches of the park. The small center is open daily from
8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
Enjoying the park
Preparation is the key to a good experience in Everglades National Park.
Here are a few things to keep in mind before you arrive:
 Bike rentals: You can rent bikes at Shark Valley Tram Tours
(% 305-221-8455), adjacent to the Shark Valley Visitor Center (see
“Just the facts” preceding this section), for $5.50 per hour.
 Climate, clothing, and mosquitoes: The Everglades are mild and
pleasant from December through April, though rare cold fronts may
bring you face to face with chilly, 58-degree conditions. Summers are
wire-to-wire hot and humid — 90 degrees and 90 percent humidity or
worse! Afternoon thunderstorms are common, and the mosquitoes
are ferocious, so bring repellent. Wear comfortable sportswear in
winter; loose-fitting pants, long-sleeved shirts, and plenty of sun-
screen in summer.
 Supplies: Bring your own water and snacks (they’re not available 
in most areas), but keep in mind that snacks aren’t allowed on the
interpretive trails, which are marked for self-guided hikers.
Camping out
If you really want to get back to nature, try camping overnight in the
Everglades. Three campgrounds have tent and RV sites, restrooms, and
water but no electrical hookups. (I hope you like your showers cold.) All
three sites are open year-round. To make reservations, call % 800-365-
2267 (U.S. only), 301-722-1257, or 888-530-9796 with a TTY for the hear-
ing-impaired. Reservations should be made at least 30 days in advance.
Sites are $14 nightly for a maximum of eight people. Here’s a rundown of
your choices: 
 Long Pine Key Campground: Seven miles from the main entrance,
just off the main road, the campground has 108 drive-up sites for
tents and RVs. There are restrooms, water, phones, a sewer dump
station, and freshwater fills but no showers. A nearby picnic area
Part III: South Florida 
172

has fire grates. The camp also has a fishing pond, an amphitheater
for winter programs, and several hiking trails.
 Flamingo Campground: Located at the end of the main park road
in Flamingo, the campground has 234 drive-in sites, including 55
with a view of the water. There are cold-water showers, two dump
stations, picnic tables, grills, and a public telephone. Flamingo has
an observation tower, hiking and canoe trails, and a store with lim-
ited groceries and camping supplies.
 Chekika: Located 6 miles west of Krome Avenue/Highway 997 on
SW 168th Street, southwest of Miami, Chekika has 20 sites for RVs
and tents, with water basins for filling jugs, a dump station with a
freshwater fill, hot showers, and a fishing pond.
Big Cypress National Preserve 
Not as well known as its national-park neighbor, this preserve is a part of
the larger, 2,400-square-mile Big Cypress Swamp, and home to an incredi-
ble array of wildlife, including alligators, bald eagles, black bears, wood
storks, and rare Florida panthers. Although a portion of the preserve is
swampland, it also has dry prairies, marshes, sloughs, hardwood uplands,
mangroves, and cypress forests. The preserve’s name refers to the vast
amount of cypresses that once blanketed the entire area. Loggers cut
down most of the virgin trees in the 1930s and 1940s. Those that remain
are mainly dwarf pond cypresses, but you can still find the occasional 
700-year-old bald cypress within the 728,000-acre sanctuary.
Big Cypress was established as a northwest buffer to Everglades National
Park and includes the ancestral home of the Seminole and Miccosukee
Indians. It’s accessible from either coast via I-75/Alligator Alley (north)
and U.S. 41/Tamiami Trail (south).
You’ll find Big Cypress rather lean on visitor amenities; this is true wilder-
ness. So unless you’re into roughing it, an afternoon of exploration will
suffice.
Here is some information that will help make your visit more enjoyable:
 Admission: It doesn’t get much cheaper than free.
 Information: Call % 941-695-4111, write to Big Cypress National
Preserve Headquarters, HCR 61, Box 110, Ochopee, FL 34141, or
surf over to www.nps.gov/bicy. Request a map and specialized
information on the preserve.
 Lodging and camping facilities: Eight primitive campgrounds are
available to the public, seven of which are free: Bear Island, Midway,
Burns Lake, Monument, Loop Road, Pinecrest, and Mitchell’s
Landing. None have water or restrooms. Dona Drive Campground
($4 per night) has an RV dump station. Call the preserve’s headquar-
ters for more information on camping here.
Chapter 12: The Everglades 173

 Oasis Visitor Center: It’s located 20 miles east of Ochopee (55 miles
east of Naples) on U.S. 41/Tamiami Trail. There’s a 15-minute film
about the preserve as well as exhibits on its flora and fauna. Pick
up a free trail map here before heading into Big Cypress. It’s open
daily from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
 Programs and activities: Ranger-led hikes, canoe trips, bike rides,
and campfire programs at the campgrounds are offered during the
winter season. If you go during the rainy season, prepare to hike
through ankle-deep water on some of the trails.
 Supplies: Located far away from civilization, the preserve has no
stores, gas stations, or restaurants. Make sure to pack plenty of
snacks and water, and fill up your tank before you set off.
Fakahatchee Strand State Park
You may laugh at the name, but this park is serious business — especially
for Hollywood types. Located in the area’s southwest corner, this second
preserve in the Big Cypress Swamp is something of a secret, but discov-
ery may be just over the horizon. The Fakahatchee served as a location
for the 2002 film Adaptation, based on the book The Orchid Thief about a
man obsessed with poaching a rare flower. 
For now, the park is about as far as you can get from Hollywood. While
Everglades National Park gets more than 1 million visitors a year, some
130,000 motorists drive through the Fakahatchee, but only a few stop to
enjoy it. Part of the blame rests with the swamp’s inhospitable nature. It’s
wild and not easily accessible. To get here, the best route involves taking
I-75/Alligator Alley from Naples or Fort Lauderdale, exiting on Highway 29
and going 14 miles south to the ranger station on Jane’s Scenic Drive.
Those who come will find bald cypresses, the largest stand of royal palms
in North America, and ghost orchids along the 11-mile Jane’s Scenic Drive,
an improved dirt road. Visits near dawn and dusk may give you a glimpse
of a black bear, bobcat, or Everglades mink, but don’t count on it. Fox
squirrels, wood storks, roseate spoonbills, snowy white egrets, and great
blue herons are commonly observed. Stay on the main road and don’t be
tempted by those dirt spur roads that go to the swamp’s wilder areas.
Part III: South Florida

Searching for skunk apes
The Everglades’ answer to Bigfoot and Yeti, Skunk Apes are supposed to be big, hairy,
and very aromatic (imagine rotten eggs and fresh dung with a trace of road-kill skunk).
Legend has it that these man-apes live in abandoned alligator dens, which would account
for the smell and their muddy-brown appearance. The 7-foot, 300-pound (or more) crea-
tures supposedly love lima beans. If all this sounds fascinating to you, just ask one of the
many willing storytellers, but so far there’s little proof of them or their lima-bean fixation.

Considering the remoteness of the location, you won’t find many visitor-
oriented amenities here, but keep in mind the following:
 Admission: This is another freebie.
 Information: Call % 941-695-4593, write to P.O. Box 548, Copeland,
FL 33926, or go to www.abfla.com/parks/FakahatcheeStrand/
fakahatchee.html.
 Programs and activities: Although this preserve is self-guided,
there’s a 2,000-foot boardwalk meandering through virgin cypress
trees at Big Cypress Bend, which is about 3 miles west of Highway
29 on U.S. 41. From November through February, rangers lead
swamp walks at 10 a.m. the third Saturday of the month. They’re
limited to 15 people, and reservations are required; call % 941-
695-4593 for more information or to make a reservation.
 Supplies: This is the boonies — bring plenty of food and water, and
top off your gas tank before you arrive.
Collier-Seminole State Park
In the early 1940s, Barron Collier, a wealthy advertising executive and
developer, laid the framework for a park that went into the state ledger in
1947. It’s named for him and the tribe that has long made the area its
home. The park’s 6,430 acres have rare royal palms, as well as salt
marshes, mangrove and cypress swamps, and pine flatwoods. Wildlife
includes wood storks, bald eagles, red-cockaded woodpeckers, American
crocodiles, black bears, and fox squirrels. Panthers, the state animal, and
manatees, the state marine mammal, may also be seen occasionally.
The park also has fishing, boating, picnicking, canoeing, and several
hiking trails. To get here, head for the entrance, 17 miles east of Naples
on U.S. 41/Tamiami Trail.
Unlike the nature preserves, the park offers a bit more for visitors to see
and do. If you decide to visit, keep the following in mind:
 Admission: $4 per vehicle.
 Information: Call % 941-394-3397 or write to Collier-Seminole
State Park, 20200 U.S. 41 S., Naples, FL 33961. Information is avail-
able online at www.floridastateparks.org/collier-seminole/
default.asp. Also, a Seminole-style log fort at the park’s entrance
houses a small information center.
 Programs and activities: A 61⁄2-mile hiking trail winds through pine
flatwoods and cypresses; a self-guided trail features a boardwalk
system and observation platform overlooking the salt marsh.
Rangers lead tours through the park from December to April. You
can see plant and wildlife exhibits in the park’s interpretive center.
Boat tours down river ($10 for adults, $7.50 for kids 6–12 years) are
available from a concessionaire.
Chapter 12: The Everglades 175

Going outdoors in the Everglades
This isn’t theme-park central, but there are plenty of outdoor activities
in the Everglades to keep you occupied.
Cycling enthusiasts should head for Shark Valley Tram Tours (% 305-
221-8455; www.nps.gov/ever/visit/tramroad.htm) in Everglades
National Park (see the information on the Shark Valley Visitor Center in
“Just the facts,” earlier); it rents bikes for $4.25 per hour. The area has
one of the top cycling venues in South Florida, a 15-mile loop that has no
traffic except other peddlers and trams. Alligators are everywhere as
you bike, so watch where you pedal! They don’t pose a major danger,
but obviously I suggest you just let them be and don’t disturb them. Give
yourself at least 3 hours to explore the entire trail. Everglades City has a
4-mile paved trail across the scenic causeway to Chokoloskee Island.
You can rent wheels at The Ivey House, 107 Camellia St. (% 941-695-
3299), for $3 an hour and $15 a day from November to May.
If you want to go canoeing, Everglades National Park has four marked
trails, 4 to 22 miles long, with starting points from the Flamingo area.
You can also take on all or parts of the 99-mile Wilderness Waterway
from Flamingo to Everglades City. Visitor centers (see “Everglades
National Park,” earlier in this chapter) distribute maps. You can rent
canoes at the Flamingo Lodge and Marina in Everglades National Park,
at the southwest end of Highway 9336 (% 941-695-3101; www.flamingo
lodge.com), for $8 an hour and $22 for a half-day ($12 and $30, respec-
tively, for a family-size model). North American Canoe Tours, 107
Camellia St., at the Ivey House in Everglades City (% 941-695-4666),
rents canoes for $25 a day (Nov–May). This outfitter also leads canoe
tours starting at $40 a half-day and $50 a full day.
The Everglades is not renowned for fishing. There are few guide serv-
ices; the coast is so remote that it discourages most surf fishermen.
Because the Glades are shallow, freshwater fishing is often frustrating.
Flamingo Lodge and Marina is the exception (% 941-695-3101; www.
flamingolodge.com) in Everglades National Park. Several guides go
after redfish, snook, tarpon, and trout out of the marina. An excursion
costs $250 per half-day for two people, $350 for a full day.
If you want a few more selections to choose from while you’re in the
Everglades area, I list some more fishing options in Chapter 15.
Taking a guided tour
Billie Swamp Safari, HC-61, Box 46, Clewiston, FL 33440 (% 800-949-6101
or 941-983-6101; www.seminoletribe.com/safari) is somewhat
Disneyfied but nonetheless offers a unique way to see the landscape. The
Seminole Tribe of Florida has opened some 2,000 acres of its Big Cypress
Reservation to eco-tours. The tours include a ride in a swamp buggy (a 
big truck with monster tires) over hardwood hammocks, wetlands, and
Part III: South Florida 
176

sloughs that are home to white-tailed deer, bison, wild hogs, bald eagles,
and alligators ($20 for adults, $18 seniors, $10 for kids 4–12). You also 
can take an airboat ride ($12 adults) or watch a 40-minute snake-and-
alligator show ($8 for adults, $4 for kids). To get there from Naples or Fort
Lauderdale, take I-75 to Exit 14; then go north 19 miles to the Big Cypress
Seminole Indian Reservation.
Flamingo Lodge and Marina, at the southwest end of Highway 9336 in
Everglades National Park (% 941-695-3101; www.flamingolodge.com),
offers two-hour backcountry cruises ($16 for adults, $8 for kids 6–12)
and 90-minute Florida Bay cruises ($10 for adults, $5 for kids 6–12),
among other tours.

blue-haired ladies who have a fancy for gold lamé, or because people
like Donald Trump have channeled the spirit of the Great Gatsby in an
ostentatious recreation of the Gilded Age, but not so. Named for the gold
salvaged from shipwrecks off its coastline, the Gold Coast shines for
over 60 miles of Atlantic shoreline, from the pristine sands of Jupiter in
Northern Palm Beach County to the legendary strip of beaches in Fort
Lauderdale. Although the only gold you’re likely to find on the 60 miles
of beaches is skin tones and a few chains dangling from necks here and
there, you’ll encounter the requisite bodies straight out of Baywatch cen-
tral casting as well as families (oh yeah — and some metal-detecting sen-
iors hoping to strike it rich). Though the beaches aren’t as rowdy as
they used to be, there’s always lots of amusement to be found on them.
And although this region maintains the gold standard when it comes to
mansions, jewels, and Rolls-Royces, you don’t need a 24-carat wallet 
to have a good time here, especially if you come during the off season,
which runs from May through October.
Seeing the Gold Coast
The most popular areas in the Gold Coast are Fort Lauderdale, Boca
Raton, and Palm Beach. While Fort Lauderdale is a favored beachfront
destination, Boca Raton and Palm Beach are better known for their
country-club lifestyles and excellent shopping. Farther north is the qui-
etly popular Jupiter, best known for spring training at the Roger Dean
Stadium. In between these better-traveled destinations are a few things
worth stopping for, but not much. 
Technically the Gold Coast begins with Hallandale, which is a sleepy
condo community just north of North Miami Beach. Its main attractions
are the Gulfstream Raceway and the fact that it leads to the rest of the

Gold Coast. Hollywood comes right after Hallandale, and it’s gone
through a renaissance of sorts. Popular with Canadian snowbirds,
Hollywood’s a low-key beach town with a touristy boardwalk and a
“downtown” featuring cafes, clubs, and bars. Further north after Boca
Raton are two burgeoning Gold Coast cities — West Palm Beach and
Delray Beach, both of which are booming with development from
modern loft buildings and luxe condos to chichi restaurants, bars, shop-
ping, and nightlife in general.
The cities and towns on the Gold Coast are close enough together that
you can mix and match many of the restaurants and attractions.
Driving north along the coastline is one of the best ways to fully appreci-
ate what the Gold Coast is all about — it’s a perspective you certainly
won’t find in a shopping mall.
The area also has 300 miles of Intracoastal Waterway — the aquatic
“highway” that travels from Boston to Key West. Dotted with million-dollar
houses and mega yachts, the Intracoastal includes Fort Lauderdale’s
Venetian-inspired canals. A boating excursion on its waters is the South
Florida equivalent of a scenic drive through Beverly Hills.
Unfortunately, like its neighbors to the south, the Gold Coast can be pro-
hibitively hot and buggy in the summer. The good news is that bargains
are plentiful in the summer months (May–Oct), when many locals take
advantage of package deals and uncrowded resorts.
Fort Lauderdale, Hollywood, and Beyond
When it comes to coastal development in Florida, the upper Gold Coast 
is second only to Miami. The beach highways (A1A/Ocean Boulevard/
Atlantic Boulevard) and U.S. 1 are well developed, offering many places to
stay and eat, numerous things to do, and 23 miles of coast. On the more
tranquil side, Hollywood is quaint but growing, sort of like Miami’s South
Beach without the tourist glut, parking fees, and attitude. Lauderdale-by-
the-Sea also tends to be more serene and quiet.
Spring-break mayhem is a thing of the past in Fort Lauderdale, thanks to
tough ordinances. People looking for rowdier action had best head down
to South Beach or up to Daytona.
Getting there
Flying is the easiest, quickest, and most economical way to get here from
most places. Florida highways and rail service make car and train travel
good secondary options, but driving is time-consuming, and taking a train
is virtually as expensive as flying.
Chapter 13: The Gold Coast 179

By plane
Fort Lauderdale Hollywood International Airport (% 954-359-6100;
www.broward.org/fll.htm) is Florida’s fourth largest airport, trans-
porting almost 14 million passengers per year. Thirty-three domestic,
foreign, and commuter airlines land here. In January 2005, the airport
debuted a fantastic Car Rental Center that houses ten rental companies
under one roof, making renting a car from the airport very convenient.
Levels 1 through 4 in the Rental Center will be the new home of Alamo,
Avis, Budget, Dollar, Enterprise, E-Z, Hertz, National, Royal, and Thrifty
(see the “Quick Concierge” in the back of this book for telephone num-
bers and Web sites). Levels 5 through 9 will provide 5,500 spaces for
public parking. Taxis and shuttles (see “Getting around,” a little later 
in this chapter) are on the same level. The same goes for Tri-County
Airport Express (% 800-244-8252 or 954-561-8888), which offers several
ride options, and limousine services, such as Broward Limousine
(% 954-791-3000) and Elite Limousine (% 954-563-2122).
Here are sample rates from the airport to Fort Lauderdale Beach:
 Taxi: $14 to $18 for up to five
 Limousine: $65 for up to eight
 Shuttle: $7 to $11 per person
If you want additional options, Miami International Airport (% 305-876-
7000; www.miami-airport.com) is only an hour’s drive south of Fort
Lauderdale and welcomes more than 100 airlines, including 42 foreign
carriers (see “Getting there” in Chapter 9 for more on MIA). Sometimes
airfares are cheaper if you fly into one airport instead of another, so
check to see if you can reduce costs by flying into Miami instead of Fort
Lauderdale. All major airlines also fly to the Palm Beach International
Airport, at Congress Avenue and Belvedere Road (% 561-471-7400).
By car
If you’re coming from Florida’s west coast, I-75 and U.S. 41/Tamiami Trail
are your best choices. I-95 and Florida’s Turnpike are the best routes to
drive on from the east coast; both require a 350- to 400-mile journey after
you cross the Florida/Georgia line. U.S. 1 (east coast) and U.S. 27 (west
coast) are additional options if you don’t mind passing through small
towns.
By train
Amtrak (% 800-872-7245; www.amtrak.com) runs two trains a day out
of New York, but they take 28 to 30 hours to reach Fort Lauderdale.
Amtrak rides from other cities can take even longer. Amtrak has a termi-
nal in West Palm Beach, at 201 S. Tamarind Ave. (% 561-832-6169).
Part III: South Florida 
180

Train travel in the United States doesn’t cost much less than airfare. If
you want a sleeper car, the price is usually higher. Unless your heart is
set on a train trip, you can most likely do better traveling in the air than
on the ground. See Chapter 4 for more Amtrak information.
Getting around
If you stick to the tourist-friendly coastal cities and the areas immediately
adjacent to them, you can find a number of good transportation options.
By car
Less expensive than taking cabs and more efficient than public transit,
driving is the best way to get around Fort Lauderdale. The main north–
south routes are U.S. 1/Federal Highway, A1A/Ocean Boulevard on the
beach side (for scenic reasons), and I-95 (for longer hauls). The primary
east–west thoroughfares are I-595, Hallandale Beach Boulevard/Highway
858, Hollywood Boulevard/Highway 820, Sheridan Street/Highway 822, SW
24th Street/Highway 84, Griffin Road/Highway 818, Broward Boulevard/
Las Olas/Highway 842, Sunrise Boulevard/Highway 838, Oakland Park
Boulevard/Highway 816, and Commercial Boulevard/Highway 870.
If you plan on driving around, invest in a map (see “Maps” in “Fast
Facts” at the end of this section on Fort Lauderdale). That said, the Fort
Lauderdale grid is pretty simple to navigate; traffic, except during rush
hour, isn’t particularly nasty. Most streets have numbers, but names are
given to the main thoroughfares, such as those that run from the west
to the beaches and back. The exception is the 17th Street Causeway,
which is the east–west road that leads to Port Everglades, a major ship-
ping and cruise port, before turning north into A1A (the road that trav-
els along the beach). All the major streets, except Broward, run across
bridges over the Intracoastal Waterway.
Although numbered streets grow consecutively between named boule-
vards, you can find some exceptions. For the most part, however,
Andrews Avenue divides the city between east and west, and Broward
Boulevard divides north and south. Streets run east and west; avenues
run north and south. Also, all addresses are assigned to one of four
quadrant designations: NE, NW, SE, and SW. A street address that’s NE is
north of Broward Boulevard and east of Andrews Avenue.
By taxi
Taxi fares for up to five passengers are $2.50 for the first mile and $1.75
for each additional mile. The biggest cab company in the area is Yellow
Cab/Checker (% 954-565-5400).
Unless you happen to be at a major hotel, hailing a taxi can be next to
impossible; so call ahead.
Chapter 13: The Gold Coast 181

By water taxi
The upper Gold Coast is one of the few places in the United States where
you can call a taxi and have a boat pick you up. The marine highway is
the Intracoastal Waterway. In addition to sightseeing, the boat stops
include boutiques and eateries along Las Olas Boulevard.
Water Taxi of Fort Lauderdale (% 954-467-0008; www.watertaxi.com)
sells one-way tickets for $4 and an unlimited day pass for $5. Taking a
water taxi is cheaper than renting a car, as long as you want to stay in its
service area. Water taxis run from 10 a.m. until midnight on weekdays
and until 2 a.m. on weekends.
By bus
Broward County Transit (% 954-357-8400; www.broward.org/bct/
welcome.htm) has 250 buses covering 30 routes. The fare is $1 for adults,
50¢ for seniors and kids taller than 40 inches (bring exact change). Buses
run daily from 4:45 a.m. to 12:35 a.m.
If you stay on the beach and limit your goings, you can get away with
using public transportation. Like many other Florida transit systems,
however, Broward County’s is designed for commuters, not tourists.
Unless you really don’t want to rent a car, I can’t recommend this public
transit system as an efficient way to get around the area.
By train
Tri-Rail (% 800-874-7245 or 954-942-7245) is a 67-mile commuter line
that connects Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade counties. As is
often the case, this public-transit line isn’t very tourist-friendly. Six com-
muter stations are located in the Greater Fort Lauderdale area. Round-
trip fares range from $3.50 to $9.25.
Staying in style
Fort Lauderdale’s beach zone is teeming with hotels and motels in every
style, size, and price range. (See the “Fort Lauderdale” map later in this
chapter.) If you’re on a tight budget, look for a hotel in Hollywood, where
rates are often cheaper. Many accommodations let kids under 12 (and
sometimes under 18) stay free if you don’t exceed the maximum-room
occupancy. To be safe, though, ask when booking a room. Refer to Chap-
ter 6 for general information about booking accommodations in Florida.
Sales and hotel taxes add 11 percent to your bill. Also note that winter
(Dec–Apr) is peak season, and rates can be 50 percent higher than
during the rest of the year.
If you’re traveling during high season and can’t find a room that you’re
happy with, or you don’t want to deal directly with the hotels, you can
choose from two good booking services. The Central Reservation
Service (% 800-555-7555; www.reservation-service.com), and
Part III: South Florida 
182

Florida Hotel Network (% 800-538-3616; www.floridahotels.com)
will make lodging arrangements after you tell them your needs.

Built around a stunning 75-year-old banyan tree, the Banyan Marina Resort
is located directly on the active canals halfway between Fort Lauderdale’s
downtown and the beach. These fabulous waterfront apartments, located

Lago Mar Resort and Club
$$–$$$
Fort Lauderdale Beach
Not to be confused with Donald Trump’s home-turned–country club Mar
a Lago, Lago Mar is an equal-opportunity hotel in which guests have
access to the broadest and best strip of beach in the entire city, not to
mention the picture-perfect bougainvillea-lined, 9,000-square-foot swim-
ming lagoon. Lago Mar is very family oriented, with lots of facilities and
supervised activities for children, especially during school holidays. For
the adults, there’s a full-service spa and 1,000-square-foot exercise facility.

Everything in this place is huge — from the guest rooms and suites to the
8,000-square-foot swimming pool to the $8 million, 24,000-square-foot
European spa. All rooms open onto private balconies overlooking either
the ocean or the Intracoastal Waterway. Best of all, it’s located on 16
secluded, oceanfront acres close enough — or far away enough, depend-
ing on your frame of mind — to/from the Fort Lauderdale “strip.”

There’s no beach here, but the hotel, built in 1936, is located on the
sleepy and scenic New River, capturing the essence of Old Florida. Out
front, the New Orleans–style hotel faces Las Olas Boulevard, where the
old meets the nouveau. The best rooms face the New River, but it’s hard
to see the water past the parking lot and trees. Twelve rooms offer king-
size beds with mirrored canopies and flowing drapes. There are also
seven elegantly decorated suites with wet bars and French doors that
lead to private balconies.

This bargain accommodation is often booked months in advance by
returning guests who want to be directly on the beach without paying a
fortune. Apartmentlike rooms have been redecorated here and exude a
very Floridian, grandmotherly feel. For even more of a bargain, check out
the hotel’s sister property next door, the 11-unit Bougainvillea. Guests at
both hotels share the Sea Downs’s pool.

Hollywood
This 1,060-room, full-service beach resort is Hollywood’s biggest hope for
revitalization. The hotel’s main building is a 39-story oceanfront tower
(with adjacent conference center) surrounded by 8 acres of man-made
lakes. A gorgeous bridged, glass-bottomed swimming pool with cascading
waterfalls, private cabanas, and a slew of water sports and activities adds
a tropical touch. Rooms are a cross between a subtle boutique hotel and
an Art Deco throwback, with dark woods, hand-cut marble and, most
impressive, the ten-layer Heavenly Bed, a Westin trademark with custom-
designed mattresses and a very cushy down blanket (crank up the AC!).
Dining options are resortlike in quantity and quality.

Dining out
Much like Miami, Broward County has virtually any kind of cuisine you
can imagine. The largest collection of restaurants in town is along Las
Olas Boulevard. Not surprisingly, seafood is a good bet in this area.
Note: All Florida restaurants and food-serving bars are smoke-free.
Don’t forget to add 6 percent local sales tax to your budget.
If you have a car, also try some of the Palm Beach–area restaurants
described later in this chapter or the Miami restaurants in Chapter 9.

Weather permitting, dine alfresco and watch the yachts glide by on the
Intracoastal Waterway or eat in the Art Deco dining room of this casually
elegant restaurant. The open kitchen dishes out excellent seafood, such
as sea bass in a macadamia-nut crust, and oak-roasted swordfish. A raw
bar and a nice wine list are available, too.

Café Martorano 
$$–$$$
Fort Lauderdale
ITALIAN
This small storefront eatery doesn’t win any awards for decor or location,
but when it comes to food that’s good enough to feed an entire Italian
family, Café Martorano is one of the best, one that has people waiting for
a table for upwards of two hours as the restaurant accepts no reservations
and can get away with it. An almost-offensive sound system (playing disco
tunes and Sinatra) has a tendency to turn many a diner off, but you don’t
go to Café Martorano for an intimate dinner. Eating here is like being in a
big, fat, Italian wedding, where eating, drinking, and dancing are para-
mount. The colossal meatballs are sublime, as are all of the pasta dishes.
Ingredients hail from all over Italy, including tomatoes grown in volcanic
soil near Salermo. The menu changes daily, but regulars have the power to
request special, off-the-menu items. If you don’t ask, you don’t get, so open
your mouth. Also keep your eyes wide open for celebrities such as Liza
Minelli, James Gandolfini, and Steven Van Zandt, among others, who make
it a point to stop here for a meal while in town. 
See map p. 184. 3343 E. Oakland Park Blvd. % 954-561-2554. Reservations not
accepted. Main courses: $13–$29. MC, V. Open: Daily 5–11 p.m.
Cap’s Place Island Restaurant

Lighthouse Point
SEAFOOD
Opened in 1928 by a bootlegger who ran in the same circles as gangster
Meyer Lansky, this barge-turned-restaurant is one of South Florida’s best-
kept secrets. Although it’s no longer a rum-running restaurant and gam-
bling casino, its illustrious past (FDR and Winston Churchill dined here
together, too) landed it a coveted spot on the National Register of Historic
Places. To get there, you have to take a ferryboat, provided by the restau-
rant. And the food’s good, too! Traditional seafood dishes such as Florida
or Maine lobster, linguine with clams, clams casino, and oysters
Rockefeller will take you back to the days when a soprano was thought to
be just an opera singer.
See map p. 184. 2765 NE 28th Court. % 954-941-0418. Reservations accepted. To
get there: From I-95, exit at Copan’s Road and go east to U.S. 1 (Federal Highway).

Eduardo De San Angel 
$$–$$$
Fort Lauderdale
MEXICAN
Gourmet Mexican is not an oxymoron, and for those who don’t believe
that, take one meal at the sublime Eduardo De San Angel and you’ll see
how true it is. Chef Eduardo Pria has a masterful way with food as seen in
dishes such as Jaibas Rellenas, fresh Florida blue crab, plum tomatoes,
onions, jalapeño peppers, and Spanish green olives baked in a shell with
Chapter 13: The Gold Coast 187

melted jack cheese au gratin and mole poblano, herb-oil-brushed grilled
breast of chicken topped with the traditional mole from Puebla, toasted
sesame seeds, and sliced avocado. And then there’s the roasted poblano
pepper filled with fresh Florida blue crab, pickled jalapeño peppers, green
olives, and tomatoes over stewed sweet onions baked in a parchment-
paper pocket. Fresh flowers and candlelight, not to mention the fact that
the restaurant resembles an intimate hacienda, also drive home the fact
that this isn’t your mom’s Old El Paso taco dinner.

Himmarshee Bar & Grille 
$$
Fort Lauderdale
AMERICAN
Located on a popular street of bars frequented by Fort Lauderdale’s young
professionals, Himmarshee Bar & Grille is known for its cool scene and its
cuisine. A mezzanine bar upstairs is ideal for people watching; outdoor
tables, if you can score one, are tight but strategically situated in front of
all the street’s action. On Friday and Saturday nights, in particular, it’s dif-
ficult to get a table here. However, if you can deal with cramming into the
bar, it’s worth a cocktail or two. The wine list is particularly impressive,
and the grilled sirloin burger with creamy basil Gorgonzola is a delicious
meal in itself for only $7.50. Also try the wasabi-crusted salmon or the pan-
roasted Baramundi (Australian sea bass). Check out Side Bar, the restau-
rant’s very Colorado ski-lodgey bar next door featuring live music and a
bustling crowd of young hipsters on the prowl.

Mark’s Las Olas
$$–$$$
Fort Lauderdale
CONTEMPORARY CUISINE
The first chichi restaurant to hit Las Olas Boulevard, Mark’s Las Olas cer-
tainly deserves its staying power, thanks to star chef Mark Militello. One
standout specialty is the grilled spiny lobster, with applewood-smoked
bacon-conch sauce, sweet plantain mash, and conch fritters. If the kitchen
is out of it — they tend to run out quickly — everything else on the menu,
from the tuna pizza to the wood-oven-roasted salmon, is delicious. Save
room for a chocolate dessert — any one will do.

This authentic Greek taverna offers delicious meze (appetizers) such as

Exploring Fort Lauderdale, Hollywood, and beyond
Despite the upper Gold Coast’s size and tenure as a tourist destination,
it has relatively few attractions. The beaches, however, more than make
up for the lack of sights.
Relaxing on the beaches
The southern part of the Gold Coast, Broward County, has the region’s
most popular and amenities-laden beaches, which stretch for more than
23 miles. Most do not charge for access, though all are well maintained.
Here’s a selection of some of the county’s best from south to north.
Hollywood Beach, stretching from Sheridan Street to Georgia Street, is 
a major attraction in the city of Hollywood, a virtual carnival with a
motley assortment of young hipsters, big families, and sunburned French
Canadians who dodge bicyclers and skaters along the rows of tacky 
souvenir shops, T-shirt shops, game rooms, snack bars, beer stands,
hotels, and even miniature-golf courses. The 3-mile-long Hollywood
Beach Broadwalk, modeled after Atlantic City’s legendary boardwalk, is
Hollywood’s most popular beachfront pedestrian thoroughfare, a cement
promenade that’s 30 feet wide and stretches along the shoreline. Popular
with runners, skaters, and cruisers, the Broadwalk is also renowned as a
hangout for thousands of retirement-age snowbirds who get together for
Chapter 13: The Gold Coast 189

frequent dances and shows at a faded outdoor amphitheater. Despite
efforts to clear out a seedy element, the area remains a haven for drunks
and scammers, so keep alert.
If you tire of the hectic diversity that defines Hollywood’s Broadwalk,
enjoy the natural beauty of the beach itself, which is wide and clean.
There are lifeguards, showers, bathroom facilities, and public areas for
picnics and parties.
The Fort Lauderdale Beach Promenade, along the beach, underwent a
$26 million renovation and it looks fantastic. It’s especially peaceful in
the mornings when there’s just a smattering of joggers and walkers. but
even at its most crowded on the weekend, the expansive promenade
provides room for everyone. Note, however, that the beach is hardly
pristine; it is across the street from an uninterrupted stretch of hotels,
bars, and retail outlets. Also nearby is a megaretail and dining complex,
Beach Place on A1A, midway between Las Olas Boulevard and Sunrise
Boulevard.
Just across the road, on the sand, most days you will find hard-core vol-
leyballers, who always welcome anyone with a good spike, and an invit-
ing ocean welcoming swimmers of any level. The unusually clear waters
are under the careful watch of some of Florida’s best-looking lifeguards.
Freshen up afterward in any of the clean showers and restrooms conve-
niently located along the strip. Pets have been banned from most of the
beach in order to maintain the impressive cleanliness not commonly
associated with such highly trafficked public beaches; a designated area
for pets exists away from the main sunbathing areas.
Especially on weekends, parking along the ocean-side meters is nearly
impossible to find. Try biking, skating, or hitching a ride on the water
taxi instead. The strip is located on A1A, between SE 17th Street and
Sunrise Boulevard.
Dania Beach’s John U. Lloyd Beach State Park, 6503 N. Ocean Dr., Dania
(% 954-923-2833), is 251 acres of barrier island between the Atlantic
Part III: South Florida 
190
Turtle Trail
In June and July, the John U. Lloyd beach is crawling with nature lovers who come for
the spectacular Sea Turtle Awareness Program. Park rangers begin the evening with a
lecture and slide show while scouts search the beach for nesting loggerhead sea tur-
tles. If a turtle is located — plenty of them usually are — a beach walk is conducted,
where participants can see the turtles nesting and, sometimes, their eggs hatching. The
program begins at 9 p.m. on Wednesdays and Fridays from mid-May through mid-July.
Call % 954-923-2833 for reservations. Comfortable walking shoes and insect repellent
are recommended. The park entrance fee of $3 to $5 per carload applies.

Ocean and the Intracoastal Waterway, from Port Everglades on the north
to Dania on the south. Its natural setting contrasts sharply with the
urban development of Fort Lauderdale. Lloyd Beach, one of Broward
County’s most important nesting beaches for sea turtles, produces some
10,000 hatchlings a year. The park’s broad, flat beach is popular for
swimming and sunning. Self-guided nature trails are great for those who
are too restless to sunbathe.
The top attractions (after the beaches, that is)
IGFA (International Game Fish Association) World Fishing Center
Dania Beach
It may smell a little fishy, but if you’re one of America’s 60 million rod-and-
reelers, you’ll think that you’re in angler’s heaven. The $32 million complex
includes a Fishing Hall of Fame, an honor roll of folks who caught the really
big ones, and a collection of vintage lures. Fishing fans will spend at least
two hours here.
If the World Fishing Center baits your hook, drop in next door at Bass Pro
Shops Outdoor World (% 954-929-7710; www.outdoor-world.com),
where a 160,000-square-foot showroom sells fishing, hunting, boating, and
golfing goodies.

Olympian, and charter-member Johnny Weissmuller; seven-time (1972)
Olympic champ Mark Spitz; and former lifeguard and collegiate swimming
team captain, President Ronald Reagan. There’s an interactive area, two
swimming pools, a theater, photos galore, and artifacts dating to the
1500s. Allow one and a half to two hours.

it to this informative and entertaining museum of science and (natural)
substance. Allow three to four hours to see the museum’s scientific play-
ground, space-flight simulator, ecology area with living turtles and sharks,
virtual volleyball game, Internet area, and five-story IMAX theater.

Stranahan House
Fort Lauderdale
Built in 1901 as a trading post, Stranahan House is the city’s oldest stand-
ing structure and an example of pre–cookie cutter, Florida-frontier archi-
tecture. This is a pleasant way to spend an hour or so if you’re a museum
or architecture buff; otherwise, skip it.

More cool things to see and do
Beyond the first tier, Fort Lauderdale offers many other sights, including
some items that will appeal to folks with special interests.
Baseball and spring training
The Baltimore Orioles (% 954-776-1921; www.theorioles.com) train 
at Fort Lauderdale Stadium, 5901 NW 12th Ave. Tickets cost $6 to $12.
Workouts begin in mid-February, and games are played during March. In
the sport of ice hockey, the youngish Florida Panthers (% 954-835-7000)
have already made history. In the 1994–95 season, they played in the
Stanley Cup finals, and the fans love them. They play in Sunrise at the
Office Depot Center at 2555 NW 137th Way (% 954-835-8000). Tickets
range from $14 to $100. Call for directions and ticket information.
Fishing
The saltwater pickings are the same farther south: redfish, trout, snook,
mackerel, sailfish, grouper, and snapper. Charters for small groups (up
to four people) inshore begin at about $250 for a half-day, $450 for a full
day; deep-sea excursions are about double that. Rates on large party
boats start at $40 per half-day, $60 for a full day. Action Sportfishing
(% 954-423-8700; www.actionsportfishing.com) and Hillsboro Inlet
Marina (% 954-943-8222) are among the area’s more notable outfitters.
Gambling
The Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Hollywood (% 866-502-
7529 or 954-327-7625; www.seminolehardrockhollywood.com) is one of
South Florida’s most popular destinations, a 24/7, Vegas-esque hot spot.
The Hard Rock can be seen off the Florida Turnpike, and its stark, white
minimalist façade is very deceiving. Beyond the façade, it’s an 86-acre
resort featuring a colossal 130,000-square-foot casino, a lush 4-acre lagoon
area with a theme-park-style water slide, authentic Seminole Chickee 
Part III: South Florida 
192

poolside cabanas. There’s also a massive European-style spa and fitness
center, and Seminole Paradise, a 300,000-square-foot dining, shopping, and
entertainment district. The gambling isn’t exactly Vegas in that there are
no games in which you bet against the house, so what you’ll find is poker,
lots of it, and video slot machines, even more of them. The complex is
located on State Road 7 (U.S. Highway 441) just north of Stirling Road on
the Seminole Indian Reservation.
Further south in Hallandale is the Gulfstream Park, at U.S. 1 and
Hallandale Beach Boulevard (% 305-931-7223; www.gulfstreampark.
com), a South Florida institution for horse racing that at press time was
undergoing a multi-million-dollar renovation and expansion. Large
purses and important races are commonplace at this sprawling subur-
ban course, and the track is typically crowded.
Golfing
More than 50 golf courses offer tee times to the public in the Fort
Lauderdale area. For information on golfing in the region, surf over to
www.golf.com and www.floridagolfing.com. You can also request
course information from the Florida Sports Foundation (% 850-488-
8347) or Florida Golfing (% 877-222-4653). Here is a small sampling of
the courses available in the area:
 The Carolina Club, 3011 Rock Island Rd., Margate (% 954-753-
4000), has a par-72 course with tough water hazards and a lot of
doglegs. Greens fees are $75 to $100 in the winter and $30 to $50 in
the summer.
 The Crystal Lake Country Club, 3800 Crystal Lake Dr., Pompano
Beach (% 954-943-2902), offers a fun-but-forgiving course with
narrow fairways. Greens fees are $50 to $75 during the winter and
$30 to $50 in summer.
 Hillcrest Golf Club, 4600 Hillcrest Dr., Hollywood (% 954-983-
3142), is one of the area’s prettiest courses and has an island green
on the ninth hole. Greens fees are $50 to $75 during winter and $30
to $50 in summer.
Touring
Several companies offer waterfront cruises. Jungle Queen, 801 Seabreeze
Blvd./A1A in Bahia Mar Marina, Fort Lauderdale (% 954-462-5596; www.
junglequeen.com), runs three-hour sightseeing ($13.50 adults, $9.25 chil-
dren 12 and under) and four-hour dinner cruises ($31 adults, $17 kids
4–12) aboard a riverboat. Water Taxi of Fort Lauderdale (% 954-467-
0008; www.watertaxi.com) travels the Intracoastal Waterway. In addition
to sightseeing, the water taxi stops at boutiques and eateries along Las
Olas Boulevard. One-way tickets are $4, and an unlimited all-day pass is
$5. You can call for pickup or hail one from 10 a.m. until midnight on week-
days, until 2 a.m. on weekends.

Shopping the local stores
Fort Lauderdale has the same kinds of shops and malls that you can find
in most major cities. Most stores are open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. from
Monday through Saturday and from noon to 5 p.m. on Sunday. Those
shops located in malls and major shopping centers keep their doors
open as late as 9 or 10 p.m. except on Sunday.
If you feel like shopping, here are some favorite places to browse in the
Fort Lauderdale area:
 Antique Row: Hundreds of shops line Dania’s old stuff district on
Federal Highway/U.S. 1, just south of the airport. Most upscale
shops are overpriced, but some smaller ones offer bargains.
 Hallandale Beach Boulevard (also known as “Schmatta Row”):
You can find deep discounts on off-brand shoes, bags, and jewelry
in a string of stores east of Dixie Highway and the railroad tracks.
 Las Olas Boulevard: This is arguably Fort Lauderdale’s trendiest
shopping area, but bargains are hard to find here. Hundreds of bou-
tiques, galleries, and restaurants can keep you browsing and
buying at least for a full day along Las Olas. 
Mall shopping may very well be the favorite local sport, and a number 
of excellent places can bust your bank account. Broward Mall, 8000 W.
Broward Blvd., Plantation (% 954-473-8100), has 120 stores with such
anchors as Burdines, Sears, and J.C. Penney. The Galleria, 2414 E. Sunrise
Blvd., Fort Lauderdale (% 954-564-1036), offers Neiman Marcus, Lord &
Taylor, Saks, Dillard’s, and 150 other shops. Bargain hunters should head
for Sawgrass Mills, Flamingo Road at West Sunrise Boulevard in Sunrise
(% 800-356-4557 or 954-846-2300). The largest outlet mall in the world,
Sawgrass Mills sports 270 outlet stores, including Neiman Marcus, Ann
Taylor, Saks, and DKNY.
Living it up after dark
If you’re still hankering for some action after a day at the beach, you can
find plenty after the sun goes down. Fort Lauderdale is home to hundreds
of bars and clubs that cater to a wide range of tastes. In addition to the
hot spots listed in the following sections, check out Friday’s entertain-
ment section in the local newspaper, the Sun-Sentinel. Tickets for specific
events, concerts, plays, and other performances can be booked through
Ticketmaster (% 954-523-3309; www.ticketmaster.com).
Bars
Most of the large, modern hotels have lounges that liven up after dark. A
particularly good one is the Pier Top Lounge (% 954-525-6666) in the
Hyatt Regency Pier Sixty-Six at 2301 SE 17th St. (A1A and 17th Street
Causeway). Other popular Fort Lauderdale watering holes include Rush
Street, 220 SW Second St. (% 954-522-6900); The Parrot, 911 Sunrise
Part III: South Florida

Lane (% 954-563-1493); and Elbo Room, 241 S. Atlantic Blvd. (% 954-
463-4615). Riverwalk, 200 E. Las Olas Blvd. (% 954-468-1541), is a
dining and entertainment complex in downtown Fort Lauderdale with
plenty of rowdy bars. In Pompano Beach, check out Durty Harry’s, 3214
E. Atlantic Blvd./A1A (% 954-783-7060).
Clubs
O’Hara’s Pub and Jazz Cafes, 722 E. Las Olas Blvd., Fort Lauderdale 
(% 954-524-1764), and 1903 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood (% 954-925-
2555; www.heatbeat.com/oharasjazzcafe.html), are moody clubs
with live music. For the diehard clubber in you, Karma Lounge, 4 W. Las
Olas Blvd., Fort Lauderdale (% 954-609-6369), has a resident DJ from
the U.K. to spin you right round, baby. You pay anywhere from $3 to $12
as a cover.
Music venues
The Broward Center for Performing Arts, 201 SW Fifth Ave., Fort
Lauderdale (% 800-564-9539 or 954-462-0222; www.browardcenter.org)
has large and small theaters that feature everything from comedy and

Boca Raton, Palm Beach, and 
West Palm Beach
The ritzy reputations of Palm Beach and Boca, the playgrounds of the
Pulitzers, Rockefellers, and Kennedys, may be enough to scare away
budget-conscious travelers. But these areas have changed a great deal in
the last quarter of a century. Although the wealthy still winter here, they
no longer own the franchise, and affordable places have grown up
around them. As I show you in the next several pages, Palm Beach and
Boca offer plenty of cool, and relatively cheap, things to do.
Getting there
Flying here is your best bet, although modern interstate highways and
rail lines make car and train travel viable options, if you don’t mind a
long ride.
By plane
Palm Beach International Airport (% 561-471-7412; www.pbia.org) 
welcomes 16 domestic carriers and Air Canada and serves about 6 million

passengers a year. Alamo, Avis, Budget, Dollar, Enterprise, Hertz, and
National rental-car agencies are stationed on Level 1. Hotel shuttles and
taxis also depart from Level 1.
Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (% 954-359-6100;
www.co.broward.fl.us/fll.htm) is a second option and has about
double the airlines that Palm Beach does. See the “By plane” section in
“Fort Lauderdale, Hollywood, and Beyond” earlier in this chapter for
details on the Fort Lauderdale airport. And check out the “Quick
Concierge” in the back of the book for general information on airlines
and rental-car companies.
By car
I-75 and U.S. 41 lead in from the west. I-95 and Florida’s Turnpike are the
best routes to use when driving in from the north. If you’re on a tight
budget, use I-95 because the turnpike’s tolls are high. (You’ll pay $9 driv-
ing here from Orlando.) U.S. 1 and U.S. 27 are options if you don’t mind
passing through small towns and traffic lights. It’s 300 to 350 miles from
the state line to here.
By train
Amtrak (% 800-872-7245; www.amtrak.com) has a station in West Palm
Beach at 201 S. Tamarind Ave. (% 561-832-6169).
Getting around
Like its neighbors to the south — Broward and Miami-Dade counties —
Palm Beach County is relatively easy to navigate because most of the
development is along the coast. Traffic, although not quite as bad as in
the Miami area, can be bad enough; you may want to leave the driving to
someone else.
By car
The same roads that get you here are the primary north–south thorough-
fares (I-95, A1A, and U.S. 1). Common east–west routes include Palmetto
Park Road (Boca Raton), Atlantic Avenue/Highway 806 (Delray Beach),
and Okeechobee Road/Highway 704 (West Palm and Palm Beach).
By taxi
Sunshine Cab (% 561-832-8500) in West Palm Beach and Metro Taxi
(% 561-391-2230) in Boca Raton are two of several taxi companies in

Staying in style
Palm Beach County tends to be pricey, with most accommodations
falling into either the luxury or chain-hotel categories. (Skip ahead to the
“Palm Beach and Boca Raton” map for an overview.) If you don’t find
anything that fits your budget in the listings that follow, check out the
chain-hotel numbers and Web sites in the “Quick Concierge” at the back
of this book.
Florida Hotel Network (% 800-538-3616; www.floridahotels.com)
can take care of your hotel arrangements after you tell the folks there
your specific needs. You can also try Palm Beach Accommodations 
(% 800-543-SWIM). This booking service specializes in long-term
rentals, but it does represent other kinds of accommodations.
Many accommodations let kids under 12 (and sometimes under 18) stay
free if you don’t exceed the maximum occupancy. But, to be safe, ask
when booking. Also, pools and air-conditioning are part of the deal unless
otherwise noted.
Don’t forget the 10 percent sales and hotel taxes.

Boca Raton Resort and Club
$$$$
Boca Raton
Welcome to the Hotel California of Boca Raton. Built in 1926 by Addison
Mizner, the posh resort now comprises three oddly matched buildings: the
original, more traditional building; the somewhat drab, pink, 27-story
Tower; and the more modern, airier Beach Club, which is accessible by a
water shuttle. Everything at this resort, which straddles the Intracoastal
and encompasses over 350 acres of land, is fully at your fingertips; how-
ever, it sometimes requires a little effort to reach it. The amenities here
cannot be beat. The resort features two 18-hole championship golf
courses, a $10 million Tennis and Fitness Center, indoor basketball and
racquetball courts, a 25-slip marina with full fishing and boating facilities,
and a private beach with water-sports equipment for rent. With a choice

The Breakers
$$$$
Palm Beach
Speaking of Palm Beach without mentioning this extra-starchy, hoity-toity
resort is impossible, but the royal-sized rates make it better for sightsee-
ing than staying. The 1920s, Great Gatsby–style resort epitomizes Palm
Beach luxury. Guest rooms range from 250-square-foot standards (ask for
a corner room, which offers a bit more room for the same price) to ocean-
front suites that are double that. All rooms have a full array of luxurious
and modern amenities, including robes and PlayStations. The resort has 2
golf courses, 14 tennis courts, 7 restaurants, and 4 bars. A revamp of
Florida’s oldest existing golf course, led by Brian Silva, transformed The
Breakers Ocean Course into a 6,200-yard, championship-level par 70. Also
superb is the hotel’s Family Entertainment Center, a fabulous 6,160-square-
foot space filled with video games, skee ball, air hockey, board games, a
children’s movie room, computers and X-Box games, and several super-
vised camp programs designed for children.

Delray Beach
Ever since Delray Beach came into its own as a dining and nightlife hot
spot, this hotel has been hopping. Located halfway between Boca Raton
and Palm Beach, this hotel — popular with business travelers — has 342
rooms and suites equipped with the usual array of modern amenities. The
hotel overlooks the ocean and is within walking distance of boutiques, gal-
leries, cafes, restaurants, and nightlife. You can skip a rental car if you
aren’t interested in seeing some of the area’s outermost attractions; a car
is a must, however, if you want to venture into the downtown or West Palm
Beach area.

Sundy House
$$$
Delray Beach
Sundy House is the oldest residence in Delray Beach and is a bona fide 1902
Queen Anne house that has been restored to its full Victorian glory — on
the outside, at least. Inside, however, the four one- and two-bedroom apart-
ments are in a style that is best described as Caribbean funky, adorned in
brilliant colors and with state-of-the-art audiovisual equipment, full modern
kitchens, and laundry facilities. Six new guest rooms known as The Stables
are equestrian chic, with more rustic appointments, including dark-wood
furnishings and wooden floors. And while the rooms here are comfortable
and gorgeous in their own rights, it’s the surrounding property of the Sundy
House that garners the most oohs and aahs. Set on an acre of lush gardens,
the Sundy House is surrounded by more than 5,000 species of exotic plants,
gently flowing streams, and colorful parrots, making an escape here seem
more like something you’d find in Hawaii rather than South Florida. And
going along with the whole nature theme is the hotel’s swimming pond, lit-
erally that, in which guests can swim with the fish (in a good way!). The
restaurant, De La Tierra, uses fresh herbs, fruits, and vegetables grown at
the hotel’s off-property farm.

Dining out 
Palm Beach has some of the finest restaurants in Florida, and you’ll pay
royally to dine with the upscale types who winter here. The dress code is
a tad more formal as well; most men wear blazers, and ladies sport classy
dresses when dining out. Boca has its fair share of pricey seafood and
steak joints, but the atmosphere is a bit more casual. Note: All Florida
restaurants and food-serving bars are smoke-free.
If you have a car, you can easily get to the Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood
restaurants mentioned earlier in this chapter.
Don’t forget to allow for the 6 percent sales tax.

This award-winning restaurant offers romantic dining and superb serv-

there’s a grand caviar bar ($16.50–$87). The main events include sea bass

FLORIBBEAN
This restaurant is a stunning experience that combines elegant indoor
dining and lush tropical outdoor settings with gastronomic wizardry that’s
a product of the fresh fruits, vegetables, and spices grown on the hotel’s
5-acre farm. Each dish is prepared with a palpable, edible precision.
Consider the following: Smoked tomato soup is served with tiny grilled
brie sandwiches and cilantro sour cream; leg of duck confit cakes are
served with mango coleslaw; calamari is breaded with blue cornmeal, fried
crispy, and plated with chipotle lime vinaigrette, red chili aioli, and tropi-
cal fruit salsa; diver scallops are caramelized and served with truffle-
braised oyster mushrooms, corn broth, caviar, and microgreens; and
chicken is marinated in pesto and served with mushroom risotto, truffled
roasted chicken broth, baby carrots, and broccoli rapini. Save room for
dessert, which includes a phenomenal American blueberry cobbler and
mango and jackfruit shortcake. A decadent Sunday brunch buffet makes
the day before going back to work infinitely more bearable. De La Tierra
may mean “of the earth,” but in my book, it’s from the gods.

The top attractions
Flagler Museum
Palm Beach
This estate, billed as the “Taj Mahal of North America,” was a gift from rail-
road and oil magnate Henry Flagler to his third wife. Built in 1902 to the
tune of $4 million, the museum has a marble entry and 55 antiques-filled
rooms, including a Louis XIV music room. Guided tours are available.
Outside, you can look at The Rambler — Flagler’s private rail car. Allow
two hours.

See map p. 199. 1 Whitehall Way. % 561-655-2833. www.flagler.org. To get
there: Go north on A1A, left on Worth Avenue, west to Coconut Row, right 8⁄10 mile to
the museum. Admission: $10 adults, $3 kids 6–12. Open: Tues–Sat 10 a.m.–5 p.m., Sun
noon–5 p.m..
International Museum of Cartoon Art
Boca Raton
For those who don’t think it a laughing matter when someone tosses the
funny pages in the trash, this museum is pure bliss. The works of artists
from 50 countries are housed in a collection of 160,000 drawings that
includes comics, gags, editorial cartoons, and more. A single artist’s work —
such as that of the late Charles Schultz, who created Peanuts — is usually
featured for months at a time. There’s also a toon-town hall of fame. The
museum will keep you busy for two to four hours.
See map p. 199. 201 Plaza Real. % 561-391-2200. www.cartoon.org. To get there:
On U.S. 1, 2 blocks north of Palmetto Park Road in Mizner Park. Admission: Donation
requested. Open: Wed–Sun 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Lion Country Safari
Loxahatchee
The featured attractions are well fed. But just in case, convertibles and
pets are not allowed, and you have to keep your car windows up as you
drive through. You can rent cars for $8 per one and a half hours, and pets
can stay in a kennel for a $5 refundable deposit. Park residents also include
gibbons, wildebeests, rhinos, and elephants. There’s also a walking tour, a
cruise, and a kids’ petting zoo (no meat-eaters here, of course). Allow at
least two and as many as four hours to see everything. 
See map p. 199. 2000 Lion Country Safari Rd. % 561-793-1084. www.lioncountry

Boulevard. Admission: $17.95 adults, $15.95 seniors, $12.95 kids 3–9. Open: Daily 
10 a.m.–5:30 p.m.
Palm Beach Zoo at Dreher Park
West Palm Beach
It seems that every city has to have a zoo of some sort, so here’s Palm
Beach’s. A dainty, compact 22 acres, this zoo has 500 animals, including
tigers, giant tortoises, kangaroos, and wallabies. There’s an elevated
boardwalk that allows you to see deer, shore birds, and plants. The kids’
zoo gives little ones a chance to dirty their hands and clothing. The Zoo’s
newest attraction is the Tropics of the Americas, a 3-acre jungle path and
complex that will immerse zoo guests into the animals, plants, and culture
of a new-world rain forest. Figure on spending about one and a half to two
and a half hours here, more if you walk like a sloth.

The Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens, 4000 Morikami Park Rd.,
Delray Beach (% 561-495-0233; www.morikami.org; see map p. 199),
was once home to a short-lived agricultural community. Today, it’s the
only U.S. museum dedicated to living Japanese culture and features gar-
dens, trails, art, artifacts, and bonsai. It costs $9 for adults, $8 for seniors,
and $6 for kids 6 to 18. The museum is open Tuesday through Sunday
from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The South Florida Science Museum, 4801 Dreher Trail N., West Palm
Beach (% 561-832-1988; www.sfsm.org/index.htm; see map p. 199),
beckons with hands-on exhibits, laser shows, and a planetarium.
Admission to the museum costs only $7 for adults, $5 for kids 3 to 17; if
you add on a visit to the planetarium and a laser show, admission costs
$11 for adults, $8 for kids 3 to 17. The museum is open Monday through
Thursday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Friday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., and
Sunday from noon to 6 p.m.
Baseball and spring training
The St. Louis Cardinals and Florida Marlins (% 561-966-3309) share
Roger Dean Stadium at 4751 Main St. in Jupiter. Tickets run from $5 to
$17 and sell out fast, so calling for them in advance is smart. Spring
training workouts begin in mid-February; games are played through
March.
Beaches
John D. MacArthur Beach State Park, 2 miles south of PGA Boulevard
and U.S. 1 on A1A, North Palm Beach (% 561-624-6950), has a 1,600-foot
boardwalk running through 760 acres of submerged land, hammocks,
and mangroves. Expect to see ibises, herons, and skittish fiddler crabs.
Its nature center features displays and a video about this barrier island,
and there’s a footbridge to the dune area and the Atlantic Ocean. Take
Blue Heron Boulevard across the Intracoastal and turn north on Ocean
Boulevard. Admission is $4 per vehicle.
Other good beaches include:
 Juno Beach: On A1A, 1 mile north of the town. This is an undevel-
oped beach with lifeguards.
 Carlin Park: On A1A, south of Indiantown Road, Jupiter. Here you’ll
find 3,000 feet of rocky beach with lifeguards and trails.
Part III: South Florida 
206

 Lantana Park: State Road 12 and A1A, 1 mile east of Lantana.
Lantana Park is an undeveloped beach with lifeguards.
 Spanish River Park: 3000 N. A1A, Boca Raton. This 46-acre park
offers more than half a mile of beachfront manned by lifeguards.
Diving
Local favorites include Breakers Reef, a 45- to 60-foot dive that’s usually
packed with fish, and Northwest Doubles, an 80- to 90-footer where
you’ll find many tropicals and maybe some reef sharks. Tours begin at
$40 per person for divers and snorkelers.
Charter operators include Coral Island Charters (% 888-889-3483 or
561-745-9286; www.coralislandcharters.com) in North Palm Beach, 
SS Minnow (% 561-848-6860; www.ssminnow.charters.com) in Palm
Beach Gardens, and Splashdown Divers (% 561-736-0712) in Boynton
Beach.
Fishing
The Palm Beach County Fishing Club (% 561-832-6780) is a good place
to start. For $10, the club sends you a bunch of information on camps,
charters, and tournaments. Call, or write to P.O. Box 468, West Palm
Beach, FL 33402, but allow four weeks for delivery. If you want to be a bit
more spontaneous, Capt. Bob (% 561-842-8823), in the Riviera Beach
Marina at the foot of 13th Street, is a 65-foot party boat that offers four-
hour trips twice a day except Wednesday. The cost is $30 for adults, $25
for kids 11 and under.
Golfing
On the Internet, go to www.golf.com and www.floridagolfing.com for
a full list of local courses. You also can call Florida Golfing (% 877-222-
4653). Three good places to play are the following:
 Delray Beach Golf Club, 2200 Highland Ave., Delray Beach (% 561-
243-7380), has a course that is a bit long in the tooth (1923) but is
still a challenge at 6,900 yards. Greens fees run under $25 in summer,
$50 to $75 in winter.
 The PGA National Resort & Spa, 400 Avenue of the Champions,
Palm Beach Gardens (% 561-627-2000; www.pga-resorts.com),
has five courses and is home to the headquarters of the PGA.
Greens fees run $95 to $120 in summer, $135 to $150 in winter.
 The Village Golf Club, 122 Country Club Dr., Royal Palm Beach 
(% 561-793-1400), offers a course that is rated one of the 20 tough-
est in south Florida. Greens fees run under $25 in summer, $41 to $65
in winter.
Chapter 13: The Gold Coast 207

Watching polo matches
The Palm Beach Polo & Country Club, 11809 Polo Club Rd., Wellington,
10 miles west of I-95 off Forest Hills (% 561-798-7110; www.palmbeach
polo.com), puts on a pro season that peaks with the $100,000 World Cup
in March. Matches take place at 3 p.m. on Sundays from January through
April. Tickets cost $7 to $40.
Going on organized tours
Loxahatchee Everglades Airboat Tours, 15490 Loxahatchee Rd., Boca
Raton (% 800-683-5873 or 561-482-6107), offers swamp tours on 6- to 20-
passenger models. The cost is $25.50 for adults, $12.75 for kids 6 to 10,
and free for children 5 and under.
Shopping the local stores
Palm Beach has some fabulous — and fabulously expensive — shopping,
but pickings in this part of the Gold Coast are generally a little leaner
than in Fort Lauderdale. Most shops, however, have the same kind of
hours as that city: 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday and noon
to 5 p.m. on Sunday. Stores inside malls and major shopping centers are
open as late as 9 or 10 p.m., except on Sunday.
Even if you don’t like shopping, visiting Worth Avenue is a Palm Beach
tradition (% 561-659-6906). Often referred to as “the Rodeo Drive of the
South,” it stretches four blocks from South Ocean Boulevard to Coconut
Row and offers more than 200 upscale shops and boutiques. Although you
won’t find many bargains, the people watching is worth every minute. The
same is true for Boca Raton’s Mizner Park (% 561-362-0606), an outdoor
mall with 45 specialty shops, seven good restaurants, and a multiplex. In
West Palm, CityPlace (% 561-835-0862) is a $550 million, Mediterranean-
style shopping, dining, and entertainment complex that’s responsible for
revitalizing what was once a lifeless downtown West Palm Beach.
Boynton Beach Mall, 801 N. Congress Ave. (% 561-736-7900), houses 150
shops, including Macy’s and Burdines. The Gardens of the Palm Beaches
Mall, 3101 PGA Blvd., Palm Beach Gardens (% 561-775-7750), has 180 
tenants, including Saks, Bloomingdale’s, and Macy’s. Town Center Mall
(% 561-368-6000) in Boca Raton sports Bloomingdale’s, Lord & Taylor,
and Saks. It’s west of I-95 on Glades Road between St. Andrews and Butts
Road. One of the few places you can get a real bargain in Palm Beach
County is The Grand Bazaar, 5700 Okeechobee Blvd., West Palm Beach
(% 561-684-5700), a flea-market-style shopping center.
Living it up after dark
From culture to classic rock, Palm Beach rivals Fort Lauderdale when it
comes to after-dark offerings.
Part III: South Florida

Cultural corner
Staffers at the Palm Beach County Cultural Council, 1555 Palm Beach
Lakes Blvd., West Palm Beach (% 800-882-2787 or 561-471-2901; www.
pbccc.org), can give you information on everything from museums to
theater.
The Palm Beach Opera, 415 S. Olive Ave., West Palm Beach (% 888-886-
7372; www.pbopera.org) has a season running from October to April.
The Raymond F. Kravis Center for the Performing Arts, 701 Okeechobee
Blvd., West Palm Beach (% 800-572-8471 or 561-832-7469; www.kravis.
org), is the big star on the local cultural scene. Its 2,500 indoor seats and
amphitheater host more than 300 performances each year, from the
Doobie Brothers to the 70-piece Boca Pops.
Bars
Café L’Europe, 331 S. County Rd. (% 561-655-4020), has a piano bar in its
bistro, which is open six nights a week; a jazz combo plays here on Friday
and Saturday evenings. Clematis Street, in the heart of downtown West
Palm Beach (% 561-833-8873; www.downtownclematis.com), has a rock-
ing street fest every Thursday night. Many of the street’s storefronts offer
live and canned music including Respectable Street Café, 518 Clematis
(% 561-832-9999); Spanky’s Sports Bar, 500 Clematis (% 561-659-5669);
and Rooney’s Irish Pub, 213 Clematis (% 561-833-7802). For a more
organized form of nightlife, downtown West Palm’s CityPlace, with its
inviting outdoor-mall format, is home to several bars.
Clubs
Hugh Jorgan’s, 96 NE Second Ave., Delray Beach (% 561-272-7887), is a
rollicking dueling-piano bar that has shows at 8 p.m. Wednesday through
Saturday. (A $5 to $10 cover is charged on Fri and Sat.) Look for it inside
Love’s Drugs. Delux, 16 E. Atlantic Ave., Delray Beach (% 561-297-4792)
is just one of many trendy bar/club/lounges on Atlantic Avenue, but unlike
the rest, this one boasts an appearance by No Doubt’s Gwen Stefani, who
partied Delux-style after a concert.

ontrary to popular belief, there’s more to Tampa than
Busch Gardens. So although I tell you all you need to
know about Tampa’s signature theme park and its fantastic
attractions — including six stomach-churning roller coasters —
I also ﬁll you in on downtown Tampa and all that it has to
offer. I then take you for a short jaunt across Tampa Bay to St.
Petersburg and Clearwater where, if you can pull yourself
away from the Gulf Coast’s best beaches, you can experience
the very surreal Salvador Dalí Museum. The area also chips in
big-league baseball, football, and hockey.
Venturing south of Tampa Bay, I tell you about Sarasota’s cul-
tural offerings; the natural beauty of Sanibel, Captiva, and a
ton of other islands; the rich history of Fort Myers; and the
wealth of pristine Naples and Marco Island, which lie just on
the fringe of the Everglades, attracting millions of visitors
each year.

T
ampa and St. Petersburg, which are separated by 20 miles including
Upper Tampa Bay, have at least one characteristic of sibling rivals:
competitiveness, though it’s more a case of one-upmanship than battling
for the same prize. Although they have some things in common, including
ultraflat terrain and Interstate 275, there are distinct differences. Tampa is
more of a business center (although it is starting to make tourism more of
its business lately) — whereas St. Petersburg relies heavily on its beaches
and tourism — and is also one of the most built-up areas in Florida.
Despite its commercial character, Tampa attracts tourists in droves with
its signature theme park, Busch Gardens, and exceptional sports venues.
Real baseball (not just spring training) is the newest attraction in the area,
with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays playing across the bay in St. Petersburg
(see Chapter 15 for information). Tampa is also a growing port for cruise
ships bound for the western Caribbean and Mexico. For an overview of
things to do, see the “Tampa Attractions” map later in this chapter.
In this chapter, I take you to Busch Gardens, which rivals some of
Orlando’s larger theme parks. I also highlight the city’s smaller attrac-
tions, including the Florida Aquarium, Lowry Park Zoo, and Museum of
Science and Industry. And if you’re the kind of person who truly comes
alive when the sun goes down, I also take a look at the Ybor City club
scene. Although this isn’t the place to spend a week unless you include
St. Petersburg in your itinerary, Tampa’s premiere attractions definitely
merit a look.

Getting to Tampa
As is the case with most Florida cities, arriving by air is the quick-
est and, in many cases, the most convenient way to get here. Train
travel from the Northeast takes 25 to 28 hours, and if you’re coming
by car, you face a 41⁄2- to 5-hour drive even after crossing the Florida-
Georgia line.
By plane
Florida’s third largest airport, Tampa International Airport (% 813-870-
8700; www.tampaairport.com) handles about 16 million passengers a
year, half the amount of second-ranked Orlando. More than 30 domestic
and foreign lines land at TIA.
Hook up with ground transportation on Level 1, the baggage claim area,
which has SuperShuttle vans (% 800-282-6817 or 727-572-1111, $9–$27 per
person one-way throughout the Tampa area; www.supershuttle.com).
Tampa Yellow (% 813-253-0121) and United Cab (% 813-253-2424) also
serve TIA. The average fare from the airport to downtown Tampa is $14.
Level 1 is also home to Avis, Budget, Dollar, Hertz, and National rental
desks (see the “Quick Concierge” in the back of the book for telephone
numbers); eight other rental agencies have shuttle service to offsite loca-
tions. Level 3 has ATMs, information booths, first-aid stations, currency
exchanges, mail drops, and other services.
Much smaller than Tampa International, St. Petersburg-Clearwater
International Airport (% 727-453-7800; www.fly2pie.com) han-
dles flights from smaller airlines, including American Trans Air and
Southeast. Alamo, Avis, Budget, Enterprise, Hertz, and National serve
the airport. Cab fare from this airport to Tampa really is too costly to
consider.
By car
Cruise along I-75, the primary north–south route, with I-275 being the spur
that cuts through downtown Tampa and St. Petersburg. I-4 is an option if
you’re arriving from I-95 and the East Coast, though construction and over-
use make for I-4 madness worse than in Orlando. Consider U.S. 301, 41,
and 19 only if you want to take a marginally scenic route — and you have
a strong tolerance for bumper-to-bumper traffic.
By train
Amtrak (% 800-872-7245; www.amtrak.com) has a station in Tampa at
601 Nebraska Ave. If you bring your car with you on your vacation, drive
to Lorton, Virginia (four hours’ driving time from New York, two hours
from Philadelphia); then put yourself and your car on Amtrak’s Auto Train
out of Lorton. The train stops in Sanford, about 90 minutes east of Tampa.
Fares begin at $368 for two passengers and an auto.
Part IV: The Gulf Coast 
214

Orienting Yourself in Tampa
Most streets in Tampa have names, making the need for a map (see “Fast
Facts” at the end of this chapter) reasonably important. Some of the most
common streets found in this guide include Dale Mabry (west side), Fowler
Avenue and Busch Boulevard (north side), Seventh Avenue and Broadway
(Ybor City), and Kennedy Boulevard and Tampa and Ashley streets (down-
town). For the most part, the downtown and its museums are dead center,
with Busch Gardens due north on I-275, Ybor City’s clubs and memories
east on I-4, the airport and business areas west on I-275, and St. Petersburg,
Clearwater, and their Gulf beaches an hour farther west, traffic willing.
Introducing the neighborhoods
Despite its business-destination character, Tampa has plenty of places
to stay, eat, party, and play, including Busch Gardens, Florida Aquarium,
Lowry Park Zoo, and Ybor City. Downtown also has a modern perform-
ing arts center, and the city has pro football and hockey franchises.
Surrounding towns include Temple Terrace (north), Brandon and Plant
City (east), and Riverview and Ruskin (south).
Finding information after you arrive
The Tampa/Hillsborough Convention & Visitors Association, 400 N.
Tampa St. (% 800-448-2672 or 813-223-2752; www.gotampa.com) is
your best bet for information. The association also operates an infor-
mation center downtown at the Channelside Entertainment District,
701 Channelside Dr. The center is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily.
See the “Quick Concierge” at the back of the book for general Florida
information sources.
The Tampa Bay Visitor Information Center (% 813-985-3601) is located
near Busch Gardens at 3601 E. Busch Blvd. The privately owned center
sells discounted attractions tickets and has many brochures regarding
things to do in the area. The helpful staff will also book hotels and car
rentals for you. It’s open Monday through Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
Sunday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Getting Around Tampa
The best way to get around the Tampa area is to drive because the city’s
public transportation system isn’t ideal for traveling to the tourist spots.
Rush hour — the worst of which occurs from 7 to 9 a.m. and 4 to 6 p.m.
weekdays — causes severe traffic backups on Dale Mabry, Kennedy
Boulevard, I-4, I-275, and I-275’s Howard Franklin Bridge (locals refer to it
as the “Howard Frankenstein”), which leads to St. Petersburg. Because
Dale Mabry and I-275 are common routes for exiting the airport, allow
plenty of time to get to your hotel — or back to the airport if your flight
is wrapped around either peak period.
Chapter 14: Tampa 215

By car
Tampa is in the crosshairs of I-4 and I-75/275. The latter two split north
of town. I-75 goes around the city to the east toward Brandon and then
south toward Sarasota (see Chapter 16). I-275 cuts through the heart of
downtown and continues across Tampa Bay to St. Petersburg (Chapter
15). Tampa is laid out in a grid, but like many of Florida’s cities, it relies
on named streets. So if you’ll be driving — either your own car or a
rental — get a map (see “Fast Facts” at the end of this chapter). Major
roads here include Florida Avenue, which separates the east and west
portions of the city, and Kennedy Boulevard/Highway 60/Adamo Drive,
which divides Tampa’s north and south.
By taxi
You won’t find many taxis cruising the streets, waiting to be hailed, but
they usually line up at hotels, performance venues, and train stations.
United Cab (% 813-253-2424) and Yellow Cab (% 813-253-0121) are
the major taxi companies in Tampa. The meter starts at $1.45, and it’s
another $1.75 per mile. Fares are for up to five people.
By bus
HARTline, Tampa’s public transportation system, serves the city and
the suburbs. Fares are $1.30 for adults and 60¢ for seniors, children, and
riders with disabilities (exact change is required). For information, call
% 813-254-4278 or check its Web site (www.hartline.org). As is often
the case, city buses aren’t the best choice to get to and from tourist
areas.
Staying in Style
Although high season in Tampa runs from December to April, peak
season rates here are lower than those at properties near the beaches.
Downtown and the area near the airport are mostly commercial, so
hotels in these areas — although close to many of Tampa’s attractions —
are usually filled with business types and convention attendees during
the week. (See the map of “Tampa Accommodations and Dining.”) You
may also find a number of national chain hotels in these zones. See the
“Quick Concierge” in the back of the book for a listing of chain hotel num-
bers and Web sites.
Because Tampa actively caters to business travelers, visitors can often
get better deals on weekends, especially in the downtown area. And, if
you plan on visiting Busch Gardens, ask whether a hotel offers special
discount packages. Also, many accommodations let kids under 12 (and
sometimes under 18) stay free if you don’t exceed the maximum room
occupancy. To be safe, though, ask when booking a room.
All the accommodations listed here offer free parking, air-conditioning,
and pools, unless otherwise noted.

Sales and hotel taxes add 11.75 percent to your bill.
If you don’t want to haggle, the Florida Hotel Network (% 800-538-3616;

arrangements for you.

North Side/Busch Gardens
This three-story all-suites hotel is the most beachlike vacation venue you’ll
find close to the park. Whimsical signs lead you around a lush tropical
courtyard with heated pool, hot tub, and a lively, sports-oriented Tiki bar.
They pride themselves on being “so close” to Busch Gardens that “the par-
rots escape to our trees,” hence the hotel’s nickname “that parrot place.”
The bar can get noisy before closing at 9 p.m., and ground-level units are
musty, so ask for an upstairs suite away from the action. Suite living rooms
are well equipped, and separate bedrooms have narrow screened patios or
balconies. Great for kids, 11 “family suites” have bunk beds in addition to
a queen-size bed for parents. Another 28 suites are especially equipped
for business travelers (but are great for couples, too) with ergonomic
chairs and big writing desks with speakerphones.

La Quinta Inn & Suites
$$
North Side/Busch Gardens
This property, located only 11⁄2 miles from Busch Gardens, is a shade on
the upscale side, but La Quinta’s 105 rooms are still standard motel fare.
The rooms have all the standard amenities, including dataports; a free con-
tinental breakfast is included in your rate. 
See map p. 218. 3701 E. Fowler Ave. % 888-729-7705 or 813-910-7500. Fax: 813-910-

Radisson Riverwalk Hotel
$$$
Downtown
The hotel sits on the banks of the not-so-scenic metro leg of the
Hillsborough River, but the Radisson Riverwalk is a good option if you’re
after a central location. Set three blocks from the convention center, the
hotel’s 286 large rooms come with dataports and a free daily newspaper.
Two restaurants, a bar, a fitness center, and a sauna are also on-site.

Saddlebrook Resort
$$$
Far North
Set on 480 rolling acres of priceless countryside, Saddlebrook is off the
beaten path (30 min. north of Tampa International Airport) and is a land-
locked condominium development. If you’re interested in spas, tennis, golf,
or all of the above, I recommend this resort, which offers complete spa
treatments, the Hopman Tennis Program (Jennifer Capriati pitches a tent
here), and the Arnold Palmer Golf Academy. Note: The rates are per
person, double occupancy, and include breakfast and dinner daily. 
See map p. 218. 5700 Saddlebrook Way, Wesley Chapel, % 800-729-8383 or 813-
973-1111. Fax: 813-973-4504. www.saddlebrookresort.com. To get there: Off

Tampa Marriott Waterside Hotel & Marina
$$–$$$
Downtown
This luxurious 22-story hotel occupies downtown’s most strategic loca-
tion in the area’s emerging Channel District — beside the river and
Part IV: The Gulf Coast 
220

between the Tampa Convention Center and the St. Pete Times Forum.
Opening onto a riverfront promenade, the towering, three-story lobby is
large enough to accommodate the many conventioneers drawn to the two
neighboring venues and the hotel’s own 50,000 square feet of meeting
space. The third floor has a fully equipped spa, modern exercise facility,
and outdoor heated pool. About half of the guest quarters have balconies
overlooking the bay or city (choice views are high up on the south side).
Although spacious, the regular rooms are dwarfed by the 720-square-foot
suites. For those interested in boating the bay, there’s also a 32-slip marina.
See map p. 218. 700 S. Florida Ave. (at St. Pete Times Forum Drive). % 888-268-1616
or 813-221-4900. Fax: 813-204-6373. www.marriott.com. Parking: Valet $14. Rack

Wyndham Westshore
$$$
West Side/Airport
Corporate and professional types usually patronize this Wyndham, which
is located near the airport. The hotel’s 324 rooms come with free coffee,
dataports, and a free weekday newspaper. A business center, an 11-story
atrium, and a restaurant are on-site.
See map p. 218. 4860 W. Kennedy Blvd. % 877-999-3223 or 813-286-4400. Fax: 813-

Runner-up accommodations
Here are some more options. Most of these hotels (other than accommo-
dations near Busch Gardens) usually cater to business travelers, mean-
ing they may be a shade more expensive but are most likely upscale and
have a good assortment of amenities.
AmeriSuites Tampa Airport
$$
West Side/Airport
Located near the airport, some of this hotel’s 126
rooms and suites have kitchens. Rates include a free breakfast buffet, and
the hotel has a fitness room. See map p. 218. 4811 W. Main St. % 800-833-1516

Dining Out 
Not exactly a culinary hotbed, Tampa touts a respectable number of
good restaurants offering numerous types of cuisine in a wide range of
prices. You’ll also find plenty of fast-food joints, especially near Busch
Gardens and along Dale Mabry and Kennedy Boulevard. Note: All Florida
restaurants and food-serving bars are smoke-free.
Don’t forget to add 6.75 percent local sales tax to your budget. And if
you have a car, try some of the St. Petersburg–Clearwater restaurants in
Chapter 15.
Bella’s Italian Cafe
$$$
Midtown
ITALIAN
Creative dishes and very reasonable prices make this sophisticated yet
informal cafe one of SoHo’s (South Howard Ave.’s) most popular neigh-
borhood hangouts. Although you can order the wood-fired pizzas and
homemade pasta under traditional Bolognese or Alfredo sauces, the stars
here feature the tasty likes of blackened chicken in a creamy tomato sauce
over fettuccine, or shrimp and scallops in a roasted-tomato sauce over
bow-tie pasta. Finish with the house version of tiramisu. Local profes-
sionals flock to the friendly bar during two-for-one happy hours nightly
from 4 to 7 p.m. and from 11 p.m. until closing. The open kitchen provides
only appetizers, salads, pizzas, and desserts after 11 p.m.
See map p. 218. 1413 S. Howard Ave. % 813-254-3355. Reservations not accepted. To
get there: I-275 south on Armenia to Azeele, left a block to Howard, then left. Main
courses: $7–$15. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V. Open: Mon–Tues 11:30 a.m.–11:30 p.m.;

Bern’s Steak House
$$–$$$$
Midtown
STEAKS
Long regarded as Tampa’s premiere steakhouse, Bern’s offers an atmos-
phere akin to that of an exclusive club or, as some say, a bordello because
of its ornate, over-the-top decor. Although the restaurant may have lost a
little luster over the years, it’s still a favorite among travelers and locals.
Even if the menu includes seafood and chicken, ordering anything other
than the aged beef — sold in 62 cuts — is a sin. Bern’s also features a huge
wine list — more than 6,900 labels are stored on the premises — and a
dessert room upstairs. Note: Also see SideBern’s, later in the restaurant
listings.
See map p. 218. 1208 S. Howard Ave. % 813-251-2421. Reservations required. To get
there: I-275 south on Armenia to Azeele, left a block to Howard, then left. Main
courses: $18–$60. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V. Open: Daily 5–11 p.m.
Columbia
$$
Ybor City
CUBAN/SPANISH
Built in 1905, the Columbia, with its frenetic flamenco dancers in the main
dining room to the ceramic-tile exterior, is truly a Latin legend and among
Tampa’s finest restaurants. Ask to sit in the patio room for a bright time,
although it’s tough to pass on those dancers who perform nightly Monday
through Saturday ($6 per person additional charge). The paella is a tradi-
tional dish of shrimp, scallops, squid, clams, fish, and mussels in a mound
of yellow rice. Served with black beans and rice, the boliche is a melt-in-
your-mouth-tender eye of round, stuffed with chorizo. Several newer
Columbia restaurants are located in other Florida cities, but none can
touch this one, which has to appease the city’s fickle Latin diners.
Rumor has it that eating the Columbia’s boliche while listening to the soul-
ful strains of flamenco can be a powerful aphrodisiac.
See map p. 218. 2117 E. Seventh Ave. % 813-248-4961. Reservations recommended.
To get there: From I-4 go south on 21st Street, then left on Seventh. Main courses:
$14–$28 AE, DC, DISC, MC, V. Open: Mon–Thurs 11 a.m.–10 p.m., Fri–Sat 11 a.m.–
11 p.m., Sun noon–9 p.m.
Mel’s Hot Dogs
$
North Side/Busch Gardens
AMERICAN
Few guidebooks are bold enough to offer a hot-dog stand as a top dog, but
few stands can match Mel’s. Roll up your sleeves up and join some of
Tampa’s movers, shakers, and hot-dog makers at this compact red-and-
white cottage. Most of the hot-dog selections are served with french fries
and a choice of coleslaw or baked beans. Mel also sells burgers,
bratwursts, and more.
See map p. 218. 4136 E. Busch Blvd. % 813-985-8000. Reservations? Ha! To get there:
From I-275 go east 2 miles and look away from Busch Gardens. Main courses: $4–$9.
Credit cards? Ha, again! Open: Daily 11 a.m.–8 or 9 p.m.

Mise en Place
$$
Downtown
FLORIDA/CARIBBEAN
Chef Marty Blitz uses the freshest of ingredients to put together a creative,
award-winning menu that changes weekly. Main courses often include 
fascinating choices such as grainy mustard–pecan-crusted rack of lamb
with bourbon shallot demiglace, cayenne onion rings, and tarragon white-
cheddar grits; and Creole-style mahimahi served with chili cheese grits
and a ragout of black-eyed peas, andouille sausage, and rock shrimp.
See map p. 218. 442 W. Kennedy Blvd. % 813-254-5373. Reservations suggested. To
get there: Take I-275 Ashley Street exit south, turn right on Kennedy. It’s two blocks
west of the Hillsborough River. Main courses: $15–$26; tasting menu $50. AE, DC,
DISC, MC, V. Open: Tues–Fri 11:30 a.m.–2:30 p.m.; Tues–Thurs 5:30–9:45 p.m., Fri–Sat
5:30–10:45 p.m.
SideBern’s
$$
Midtown
ASIAN/FLORIBBEAN
This child of Bern’s Steak House (see review earlier in this section) has tried
out and discarded several menus styles. It’s finally settled on something
the management calls “One World Cuisine,” which is actually a mix of
Pacific Rim, African, Asian, and (I hate the word) Floribbean. Try such del-
icacies as Szechuan-glazed grouper, lemon confit organic chicken, or
chorizo-scaled sea bass. Casually elegant, the restaurant offers indoor seat-
ing in a light and airy dining room, as well as covered outdoor seating.
See map p. 218. 2208 W. Morrison St. (at Howard Street). % 813-258-2233.
Reservations suggested. To get there: I-275 south on Armenia to Azeele, left a block
to Howard, then left and around the corner from Bern’s. Main courses: $14–$26. AE,
DC, DISC, MC, V. Open: Mon–Thurs and Sun 6–10 p.m., Fri–Sat 6–11 p.m.
Wine Exchange
$$
Downtown
MEDITERRANEAN
This Tampa hot spot is a wine lover’s dream come true, in which each dish
is paired with a particular wine available by the bottle or glass. While the
menu is rather simple, featuring pizzas, pastas, salads, and sandwiches,
the daily specials are more elaborate, including grilled Delmonico steak,
blackened pork tenderloin, or dijon-crusted salmon. The outdoor patio is
a great place to sit, that is, if there’s room. There’s almost always a wait at
this buzzworthy eatery.
See map p. 218. 1611 W. Swan Ave. % 813-254-9463. Reservations not accepted.
Main courses: $10–$22. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V. Open: Mon–Fri 11:30 a.m.–10 p.m.; Sat
11 a.m.–11 p.m., Sun 11 a.m.–9 p.m.; brunch on Sat and Sun 11 a.m.–3 p.m.

224

Exploring Tampa
Although St. Petersburg–Clearwater has the five-star beaches (find them
in Chapter 15), Tampa wins when it comes to the number of attractions
available.
The top attraction: Busch Gardens
This Tampa park grew out of a brewery. In the 1960s, the main (and
only) attractions at Busch Gardens were a parrot show and free beer.
(You may be thinking, who could ask for anything more?) Today, how-
ever, although there still are birds and free beer, Busch Gardens is
among Florida’s top theme parks. Two things set it aside from Disney’s
Animal Kingdom (see Chapter 18) in nearby Orlando: its roller coasters
and its better view of critters.
Busch Gardens has six — count ’em, six! — roller coasters to keep your
adrenaline rising and stomach dropping. The newest is SheiKra, the
nation’s first dive coaster, which carries riders up 200 feet at 45 degrees
and then hurtles them 70 miles per hour back at a 45-degree angle.
Yikes. Then there’s Gwazi, a wooden wonder named for a fabled African
lion with a tiger’s head. This $10 million ride slowly climbs to 90 feet
before turning, twisting, diving, and va-rrroommming to speeds of 50
mph — enough to give you air time (also known as weightlessness).
These twin coasters, the Lion and the Tiger, provide 2 minutes and 20
seconds of thrills and chills, steep-banked curves, and bobsled maneu-
vers. At six different points on the ride, you feel certain you’re going to
slam the other coaster as you hit 3.5 Gs. (That’s science’s way of saying
that if you weigh 100 pounds, your body will feel like 350.) There’s a 48-
inch height minimum.
Smaller than an airline seat, Gwazi’s 15-inch seat is a tight squeeze for
thin folks and close to misery for larger models.
Busch’s other four roller coasters are made of steel. Kumba covers
4,000 feet of track at 60 mph. The 143-foot-high roller coaster jerks
you with sudden turns (54-inch height minimum). On Montu, speeds
exceed 60 mph while the G-force keeps you plastered to your seat (54-
inch minimum). The Python, a tad tamer, runs through a double spiral-
ing corkscrew and a 70-foot plunge (48-inch minimum). The Scorpion
offers a high-speed 60-foot drop and 360-degree loop (42-inch minimum). 
Busch’s wildlife has fewer places to hide and, therefore, is easier to see
than the denizens at Animal Kingdom (Chapter 18). Edge of Africa and
the Serengeti Plain allow views of white rhinos, lions, hippos, crocodiles,
hyenas, and other animals that seem to roam free. (In the Serengeti, Busch
encourages the 300 animals to wander closer to the tourist-carrying trains
by placing food, cool shade, and water misters nearby.)
For an extra $29.95 over the admission price, you and 19 others can join
a guide on a 30- to 40-minute Serengeti Safari Tour that gives you an

Chapter 14: Tampa 227

ultraclose look at animals and a chance to feed giraffes, gazelles, and
more. (Tours are limited; advance reservations are suggested, and chil-
dren must be at least 5 years old.)
Rhino Rally starts off as an off-road safari ride in real Land Rovers that
take guests as close as 15 feet to elephants, white rhinos, crocodiles,
cape buffalo, and other animals (riders must be at least 39 inches tall
and 3 years old). After a few adventures, the Rovers drive over a shaky
pontoon bridge that’s washed out by a mock flash flood. The vehicles
and passengers spiral downriver in what amounts to a raft ride. Note:
The “raft” portion of this ride is often shut down, turning an 8-minute
adventure into a 4-minute waste of time if the wait to board is longer
than 15 minutes.
Nairobi’s Myombe Reserve is home to gorillas and chimpanzees, that
sometimes nap or pose in front of a Plexiglass wall. The Congo features
rare white Bengal tigers. For a good view, try the sky ride and Serengeti
Railway.
The park’s three water rides provide welcome relief from the summer
heat. Tanganyika Tidal Wave is a peaceful boat ride interrupted by a 
55-foot plunge (48-inch height minimum). Stanley Falls is a log flume
ride with a 40-foot drop (46-inch height minimum). Congo River Rapids
is a raft ride very similar to Kali River Rapids in Animal Kingdom (42-
inch height minimum).
In addition to the animals, your kids will love the three-story treehouse,
slides, rides (56-inch height maximum), and the Captain Kangaroo Show
in Land of the Dragons, as well as the sandy dig site in the re-created
King Tut’s Tomb and the friendly lorikeets of Lory Landing.
To avoid long lines, buy your tickets in advance at the Tampa Bay Visitor
Information Center (see “Finding information after you arrive,” earlier in
this chapter), across Busch Boulevard from the park’s entrance.
Busch Gardens recently began offering guests a Rain Guarantee
Program: If it rains at all during your visit, no matter how much, you can
ask for a free pass to return for a second day in the next seven days at
no extra cost.
Did I mention free beer if you’re 21 or older? You can sample Anheuser-
Busch products at the Hospitality House.
Busch Gardens is located at 3000 E. Busch Blvd. at McKinley Drive/N.
40th Street (see map p. 226). From Orlando, take I-4 west to U.S. 41 (Exit
3), go right (north) to Busch Boulevard, then right (east). The route to
the park is well marked, and it’s 90 minutes from Orlando. From down-
town Tampa, take I-275 to Busch Boulevard/Highway 580 (Exit 50) and
go east. Park hours are usually at least 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily; however,
the park sometimes opens as early as 9 a.m. and closes as late as 8 p.m.
Part IV: The Gulf Coast 
228

Admission costs $56 for adults, $46 kids 3 to 9, excluding tax. FlexTicket
pricing is $225 for adults, $190 for kids for a five-park pass good for 14

Islands of Adventure, SeaWorld, and Wet ’n Wild in Orlando. Parking is $7
for cars and motorcycles, $11 for trucks and campers. Call % 866-353-
8622 or 813-987-5082 or visit its Web site at www.buschgardens.com for
more information.
Seeing other top sights
Busch Gardens may be Tampa’s top attraction, but several other city
sights are worthy of your attention, and most of them won’t empty your
wallet as fast as the theme park will.
Adventure Island
North Side/Busch Gardens
This Busch-owned water park offers 36 acres of wet fun. The A-list attrac-
tions here include the Key West Rapids, a 700-foot tube run; Tampa
Typhoon, a seven-story, adrenaline-pumping water slide and freefall; and
Gulf Scream, a 210-foot body slide that’s guaranteed to give most folks a
wedgie. This all-day affair also has picnic areas and a volleyball complex.
See map p. 226. 10001 McKinley Dr. % 813-987-5600. www.adventureisland.
com. To get there: It’s on the east side of Busch Gardens. Admission: $32.95 adults,
$30.95 kids 3–9. Parking: $5. Open: March–Oct daily at least 10 a.m.–5 p.m., some-
times later. Closed: Nov–Feb.
Florida Aquarium
Downtown
Its 4,300 animals and plants include 550 of Florida’s native species. The
galleries explore wetlands, bays, beaches, coral reefs, the sea, and the
creatures that live in them. Numerous interactive exhibits, including a 600-
gallon touch pool, make this a great place to take younger children, who
can also watch divers feed sharks and other marine life. Audio tours are
available in English and Spanish. Allow two to four hours to see everything.
Certified scuba divers who pay a $150 fee in addition to admission can
swim with a variety of sharks, including nurse, sand tiger, and black tip,
all of which are 6 feet or less in length. The program has an hour-long ori-
entation on policies and an educational presentation about sharks. The
dive begins in a cage with two dive chaperones, and then the guests can
move into the open, 13-foot-deep tank.
See map p. 226. 701 Channelside Dr. % 813-273-4000. www.flaquarium.org.
To get there: Take Kennedy Boulevard to 13th Street, turn right and follow the
signs. Admission: $18 adults, $15 seniors, $12 kids 3–12. Parking: $5. Open: Daily 
9:30 a.m.–5 p.m.
Chapter 14: Tampa 229

Lowry Park Zoo
North Side
Dating to the early 1930s, Lowry Park faced extinction 20 years ago, but
park lovers got Tampa’s oldest zoo on track. Today’s version is rated
among the top small zoos in the nation. The zoo’s 1,500 residents include
manatees, Komodo dragons, river otters, Persian leopards, sloth bears,
Indian rhinos, and Sumatran tigers. The park has a free-flight aviary, birds-
of-prey show, kids’ petting zoo, and hands-on discovery center. Home to
one of Florida’s three manatee hospital and rehabilitation centers, it’s also
a sanctuary for Florida panthers and red wolves. It takes four to six hours
to enjoy the zoo.
See map p. 226. 7530 N. Blvd. % 813-935-8552. www.lowryparkzoo.com. To get
there: Exit I-275 on Sligh Avenue and follow the signs 1 mile west. Admission: $15
adults, $14 seniors, $10.50 kids 3–11. Free parking. Open: Daily 9:30 a.m.–5 p.m.
Museum of Science and Industry
North Side
The Amazing You lets you explore the body; Diplodocus Dinosaurs offers
a close look at our earliest giants; and Flight Avionics Flight Simulator in
Our Place in the Universe takes 15 fliers on a five-minute adventure (for
an extra charge of $3.50). You also can pedal a bicycle balanced on a 
1-inch steel cable, suspended 30 feet above the ground (you’re harnessed
into the bike for the 98-foot journey). The museum has 450 hands-on,
minds-on exhibits, including a hurricane simulator, a planetarium, an IMAX
Theater, and several traveling exhibits. Plan to stick around for three to
four hours.
See map p. 226. 4801 Fowler Ave. % 813-987-6300. www.mosi.org. To get there:
2 miles east of I-275 on Fowler. Admission: $16 adults, $14 seniors, $12 kids 2–13. Free
parking. Open: Daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m.
Ybor City
East of downtown
The liveliest section in Tampa and the epicenter of the city’s Latin culture,
Ybor City was born in 1885 when Cuban exile Don Vicente Martinez Ybor
(pronounced ee-bore) moved his cigar business from Key West to a palmetto
patch east of Tampa. Hailed as the cigar capital of the world until the indus-
try high-tailed it to South and Latin America 60 years ago, Ybor City is still
a good spot to pick up a hand-rolled stogie. The Ybor City State Museum,
1818 Ninth Ave. (% 813-247-6323; www.ybormuseum.org; admission: $3;
open: 9 a.m.–5 p.m. daily; see map p. 226), tells the story of Cuban exiles and
spans half a block, including a restored worker’s home and the historic
Ferlita Bakery.
The district is loaded with excellent restaurants, shopping, and nightlife.
Just west of 21st Street, there’s a wall-to-wall run of clubs, cafes, and gal-
leries. If you come after dark, however, stick to well-lit and well-traveled
areas. Allow two to four hours to hit the major spots.
Part IV: The Gulf Coast 
230

The National Historic District stretches for 110 red-brick blocks, but most
of the action happens along a 12-block stretch of Seventh Avenue/
East Broadway (I-4 east to 21st Street, south to Broadway). The best way
to see this charming slice of yesterday is on foot. Parking spaces are avail-
able on Broadway. There’s also a lot south of Broadway near the west end.
More cool things to see and do
Some of these attractions and activities appeal to people with special
interests — whether you’re an art buff, a golfer, or a pro-sports fan.
Taking in some culture: Museums and more
Here are three options for visitors who are culturally inclined:
 Henry B. Plant Museum: Now on the University of Tampa campus,
the museum is in part of what used to be the Tampa Bay Hotel.
Although the building is the highlight of a visit, don’t skip its con-
tents: art and furnishings from Europe and the Orient; and exhibits
that explain the history of the original railroad resort, Florida’s
early tourist industry, and the hotel’s role as a staging point for
Theodore Roosevelt’s Rough Riders during the Spanish-American
War. It’s at 401 W. Kennedy Blvd. (% 813-254-1891; www.plant
museum.com; see map p. 226). Admission costs $5 for adults, $2 for
kids under 12.
 Tampa Museum of Art: Permanent and changing exhibits are
housed in eight galleries, with 6,000 to 7,000 pieces displayed.
Classical and Mediterranean antiquities and 20th-century American
art are its specialties. The museum is located at 600 N. Ashley Dr.
(% 813-274-8130; www.tampamuseum.com; see map p. 226).
Admission is $7 for adults, $6 for seniors, and $3 for kids over 6.
 Tampa Theatre: Architecture is the big draw of this 1926 classic,
but it also presents films and concerts during the year. It has bal-
conies, replicas of Roman sculptures, and one of those ghostly
Wurlitzers. Speaking of ghosts, this old house is said to be haunted
by Foster Finley, a projectionist who worked here for 35 years.
Tours are usually available at noon Tuesday and Saturday for $5
per person. Movie tickets usually are $5, too. The theater is at 711
Franklin St. (% 813-274-8982; www.tampatheatre.org; see map
p. 226).
Playing around: Sports and more
Major-league baseball has arrived, courtesy of the Tampa Bay Devil
Rays, who play across the bay in St. Petersburg (see Chapter 15). You
can also catch the New York Yankees playing their spring-training games
at Legends Field on North Dale Mabry Highway (% 813-879-2244 or
813-287-8844), where tickets will set you back $10 to $16.
Chapter 14: Tampa 231

If you prefer sports other than the national pastime, you’ll find an abun-
dance of options open to you, including the following:
 Fishing: My best advice for anglers is to head across the bay to St.
Petersburg–Clearwater (Chapter 15), where you can find several
saltwater guides at Hubbard’s Marina.
 Football: The Tampa Bay Buccaneers rose from the ashes of two
decades of frustration to win Super Bowl XXXVII under new coach
Jon Gruden. They play preseason games in August and eight regu-
lar-season games in the fall and early winter at Raymond James
Stadium at 4201 N. Dale Mabry Hwy. (% 813-879-2827; www.
buccaneers.com). Tickets are hard to come by, but you can
almost always find them advertised under the tickets category
of The Tampa Tribune classified ads.
 Golf: You’ll find loads of tee-time options on the Internet at www.
golf.com and www.floridagolfing.com. If you prefer to do your
research the old-fashioned way, request course information from the
Florida Sports Foundation (% 850-488-8347) or Florida Golfing
(% 866-833-2663). Some of the more popular courses here are:
• Saddlebrook, north of Tampa (% 813-973-1111; www.
saddlebrookresort.com), has two Arnold Palmer–designed
courses. Greens fees: $70 to $130.
• Summerfield, in Riverview (% 813-671-3311), a moderately
priced, par-71 course for long-ball hitters. Greens fees:
Under $25.
• Tournament Players Club, in Tampa (% 813-949-0091; www.
tpc.com), a challenging course best saved for golfers with
low handicaps. Greens fees: $41 to $110.
Guided tours
If you’re a foot soldier, there are several good walking tours around
town. You can join a twice-weekly, one-hour guided tour of the Tampa
Theatre. The tour costs $5 (% 813-274-8982). For a spooky time, try
Centro Ybor Ghost Walks (% 813-242-4660; www.centroybor.com). The
75-minute walks are $10 per person. J.B. Starkey’s Flatwoods Adventures
offers a 90-minute swamp buggy-style bus trek through a cattle ranch
and the ecosystem around it. Tours are $15.75 for adults, $8.75 for kids 
3 to 12 (% 813-926-1133; www.flatwoodsadventures.com).
Shopping the Local Stores
Although Florida isn’t known as a paradise for shoppers, Tampa does
offer a couple of funky areas that are worth browsing. Malls are gener-
ally open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. (noon–6 p.m. Sun); individual shops are
usually open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday.
Part IV: The Gulf Coast 
232

Tampa’s best shopping areas
Whether you’re looking for handmade cigars or discounts at factory out-
lets, here are the top places to find them:
 Ybor City: You may encounter an aged craftsman or -woman hand-
rolling cigars in the string of clubs, restaurants, and shops that run
through the core area (a 12-block stretch of Seventh Avenue/East
Broadway). You can find Caribbean trinkets at the open-air market.
Centro Ybor, a 7-acre shopping, entertainment, and restaurant
area is located on Eighth Avenue (% 813-242-4660; www.the
centroybor.com).
 Prime Outlets: This outlet mall is at 5461 Factory Shops Blvd. in
Ellenton, which is southeast of Tampa. Stores include Anne Klein,
Banana Republic, Danskin, Izod, Liz Claiborne, and Polo (% 888-
260-7608; www.primeoutlets.com).
 Old Hyde Park Village: Located south of downtown at 748 S. Village
Circle (% 813-251-3500), this landing zone has a collection of 60-
some shops and eateries in an old-world, outdoor setting. Standouts
here include Ann Taylor, Brooks Brothers, and Gap Kids.
Hitting the malls

Plaza, 250 Westshore Plaza (% 813-286-0790; www.westshoreplaza.
com), has 100 stores, including FAO Schwarz and Saks Fifth Avenue.
Living It Up After Dark
Although bars and clubs are scattered throughout the Tampa Bay area,
Ybor City has the biggest concentration. Along Seventh Avenue between
15th and 20th streets, a host of stylish clubs cater to the 20s-and-under
set. In addition, the city has several cultural venues. To find out what’s
playing where, don’t forget to peruse a copy of the “Friday Extra” section
in The Tampa Tribune (www.tampatrib.com). You can get the latest arts
information, 24 hours a day, from Artsline at % 813-229-2787.

Newspapers
The Tampa Tribune (% 813-259-7711;

Safety
Tampa has all the crime that’s associated
with a large city. I don’t recommend walk-
ing alone after dark, and you should be
wary about driving in the downtown area.
Stick to well-lit and known tourist zones,
and even then, be aware of your surround-
ings. Never stop on a highway and get out
of your car if you can avoid it. Always keep
your doors locked.
Taxes
The sales and local-option taxes equal
6.75 percent in Hillsborough County. Hotels
add another 5 percent for a total of
11.75 percent.
Taxis
Generally, getting into a taxi costs $1.45
and it’s $1.75 per mile after that. The major
companies in Tampa are United Cab
(% 813-253-2424) and Yellow Cab
(% 813-253-0121).
Transit Information
Hillsborough Area Regional Transit or
HARTline (% 813-254-4278; Internet www.
hartline.org) runs buses throughout
the county, although routes are not very
tourist-friendly. Bus fare is $1.25.

St. Petersburg, Clearwater,
and the Beaches
In This Chapter
 Sunning along the Pinellas coast
 Fishing for grouper, amberjack, and sea bass
 Going insane on the primary north–south highway
 Swimming with manatees
U
nlike Tampa, across the bay, St. Petersburg can never be described
as a business center. The city was built with visitors in mind and it
shows, especially if you’re looking for sunny escape. This 28-mile-long
stretch of shoreline and barrier islands along Florida’s Gulf Coast is
beachville, with free public strands (although you have to pay for park-
ing at most) virtually from one tip of Pinellas County to the other. In
addition to sun, sand, and sea, the area has one very surreal reason for
attracting visitors: the Salvador Dalí Museum.
The warm, calm waters of the Gulf are prone to the following annoy-
ances that can put a damper on your beach time:
 The Jellyfish Jitterbug: These translucent critters are common on
the Gulf beaches. Although their sting is far from deadly, it’s painful
enough, and their washed-up carcasses can ruin the moment. If
they sting you, meat tenderizer helps relieve the pain.
 The Stingray Shuffle: Rays love to snooze on the bottom of the
ocean. Most folks who get hit by the poisonous spines on the crea-
tures’ tails step directly down on them. If you shuffle your feet as
you walk through the water, stingrays usually skedaddle.
 The Red Tide Hide: All you can do is hide when the marine blight
known as the red tide comes to the beach. This phenomenon occurs
when a microscopic marine algae — appearing as red patches in the
water — begins to multiply at a higher rate than normal, poisoning
fish. The stink from the dead fish washing up on the beach is mon-
strous. If red tide lands, forget beach time. The Florida Marine
Research Institute maintains a Web site that includes current areas,
if any, that have red tide. It’s at www.floridamarine.org.

Okay, now that you’ve been warned, I’ll get to the introductions.
Searching the Suncoast: What’s Where?
Pinellas County is a narrow peninsula. The sun-drenched beaches on
the west side of the county — a zone nicknamed the Suncoast — are an
especially popular tourist draw. With a handful of exceptions, much of
this region’s action takes place along or near the Gulf Coast. 
St. Petersburg was conceived and built a century ago primarily for
tourists and wintering snowbirds. Here you can find one of the most pic-
turesque and pleasant downtowns of any city in Florida, with a water-
front promenade, and the famous, inverted pyramid-shaped Pier offering
great views across the bay, plus quality museums, interesting shops, and
a few good restaurants. Thanks to an urban redevelopment program, St.
Pete has awoken from its slumber and is starting to actually resemble a
city that could be considered “hip,” with renewed, restored streetscapes
full of punk’d-out skateboarders, clubs, bars, and a vibrancy that goes
well beyond the excitement surrounding Bingo night at the “adult com-
munities” in town. 
For sun and sand, there’s plenty on the 28 miles of barrier islands skirt-
ing the Gulf shore and the Pinellas Peninsula. St. Pete Beach is the
granddaddy of the area’s resorts, but a more gentle lifestyle begins on
the 31⁄2 mile Treasure Island. Over the bridge is Clearwater Beach,
whose silky sands attract active families and couples.
St. Petersburg and Its Beaches 
The southern half of Pinellas County is the west coast’s biggest tourist
zone, mainly due to the beaches on the Gulf of Mexico. As you travel
around, you may run into a few interior areas, such as Kenneth City and
Pinellas Park (north), Seminole (northwest), and South Pasadena and
Gulfport (south). But I concentrate on the most popular zones down-
town or along the coast: St. Pete Beach, Treasure Island, Madeira
Beach, Redington Shores, and Indian Rocks Beach.
Getting there
Your only convenient option to get directly to St. Petersburg or its
beaches is by plane, although driving is a possibility. 
By plane
St. Petersburg–Clearwater International Airport (% 727-453-7800; www.
fly2pie.com) courts small airlines, including American Trans Air, Pan
Am, and Southeast. Alamo, Avis, Budget, Enterprise, Hertz, and National
serve the airport. You can also get a ride from Yellow Cab (% 727-
799-2222). Standard rates are $2 to start the meter and $1.60 per mile; a
trip from the airport costs about $5 and takes between 5 and 10 minutes.
Chapter 15: St. Petersburg, Clearwater, and the Beaches 237

If you want more options, consider flying into Tampa International
Airport (% 813-870-8700; www.tampaairport.com), which is only
20 miles from St. Petersburg. (See Chapter 14 for more information.)
By car
If you’re a highway hero, you have three choices by car:
 U.S. 19: This highway, also known as Instant Insanity, is a con-
stantly clogged artery down most of Florida’s lower Gulf Coast.
 I-75/275: This road brings you across the Florida/Georgia border
and down the state’s midsection. North of Tampa, take the I-275
option (it bears right, through Tampa and then into St. Petersburg).
 I-95/I-4/I-275: I-95 gets you into the state along the east coast,
where you can pick up I-4 in Daytona Beach and ride it onto I-275,
and from there into Tampa and St. Petersburg.
Getting around
When you consider that St. Petersburg was designed with tourists in
mind, it should come as no surprise that this is one of the easiest cities
in Florida to navigate. Thank city planners who keep things simple.
By car
St. Petersburg is easy to navigate because, with only a few exceptions,
street numbers are used rather than names. Think of Central Avenue as
the bull’s-eye. Avenues run east to west. They grow (First, Second, and
so on) in either direction from Central. Streets go north–south; numbers
go higher as they move west from downtown. You’ll find a few excep-
tions, most notably the northeast and southeast addresses that are on
the city’s east side, which are numbered in reverse of the preceding
street procedure. In some cases, the beaches use St. Petersburg’s street-
numbering system; in others, they use names. The main beach road is
Gulf Boulevard/Highway 699.
By taxi
In general, it costs $2 to get into a cab and $1.60 a mile thereafter. Yellow
Cab (% 727-799-2222) is the main company in St. Petersburg.
By trolley
The tourist-friendly Suncoast Beach Trolley (% 727-530-9911), serves
St. Pete Beach and Treasure Island and runs every 30 minutes from 5
a.m. to 10 p.m. daily, until midnight Friday and Saturday. Rides cost $1.25
per person.
By bus
The Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority (% 727-530-9911; www.psta.
net) serves the entire county. The fare is $1.25 per ride for adults, 75¢

347 rooms, suites, and guesthouses overlooking the Gulf of Mexico or Boca
Ciega Bay. A full-scale spa, fitness center, and restaurant are available on-

The Suncoast is another destination made for seafood lovers, and you
can find fresh fish dishes on almost every menu. Carnivores won’t go

and those on a tight budget can find many national chain restaurants
and fast-food joints along the major thoroughfares. Note: All Florida
restaurants and food-serving bars are smoke-free.

TRADITIONAL FRENCH
This romantic Victorian house (circa 1910) tempts with a kitchen and chef
that turn out treats such as homemade pâté, Dover sole meunière, coq au
vin, and lamb filet mignon with cognac, herbs, and garlic. The wine list is
excellent, and desserts such as chocolate soufflé are sinful. Make sure to
ask for the Eiffel Tower salad, which will have you drooling every time you
see the Parisian version.

St. Pete Beach
SEAFOOD
This member of a small local chain sits right on the beach in the heart of
the hotel district. There’s an open-air rooftop bar, but big glass windows
enclose the large dining room. They offer fine water views from picnic
tables equipped with rolls of paper towels and buckets of saltine crackers,
the better with which to eat the blue, Alaskan, snow, and stone crabs that
are the big draws here. The crustaceans fall into the moderate price cate-
gory or higher, depending on the market, but most other main courses,
such as fried fish or shrimp, are inexpensive — and they aren’t overcooked
or overbreaded. The creamy smoked fish spread is a delicious appetizer,
and you’ll get enough to whet the appetites of at least two people. This is
a very good place to feed the entire family.

Exploring St. Petersburg
You won’t find theme parks or roller coasters, but there are some dandy
beaches and many other things to see and do in St. Petersburg, espe-
cially if you have a car and can visit Tampa (see Chapter 14) and
Clearwater.
The top attractions
Florida International Museum
Downtown St. Petersburg
This excellent museum attracted 600,000 visitors from around the world
when it opened its first exhibition in 1995, and the success has continued.
Its outstanding exhibit on the Cuban Missile Crisis features a full-size fall-
out shelter and a Soviet SA-2 missile and is well worth your visit even if
the two temporary exhibits don’t catch your fancy. On the other hand,
they very well could, since the museum is associated with the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington, D.C. Allow two to three hours to take in the
exhibits. A new cafe opened at the museum in February 2005.
See map p. 239. 100 Second St. N. % 800-777-9882 or 727-822-3693. www.florida
museum.org. To get there: 1 block north of Central Avenue on Second Street.
Admission: $10 adults, $8 seniors, $5 kids 6 and over. Open: Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–5 p.m.,
Sun noon–5 p.m.
Great Explorations Hands-On Museum
Downtown St. Petersburg
Although this isn’t on the same level as Tampa’s Museum of Science and
Industry (see Chapter 14), it’s user-friendly and geared to kids. Children
can don lab coats and pretend they’re vets, get familiar with spiders and
snakes, or dabble in a ton of other hands-on experiments. Allow two to
three hours to see the museum.
See map p. 239. 800 Second Ave. NE. % 727-821-8992. www.greatexplorations.
org. To get there: On the third floor of The Pier. Admission: $8 adults, $7 seniors and 
children 3–11. Open: 10 a.m.–8 p.m. Mon–Sat, 11 a.m.–6 p.m. Sun.
Salvador Dalí Museum
Downtown St. Petersburg
Wow, did this guy have a different perspective of Spaceship Earth! St.
Petersburg, of all places, has the world’s largest collection of what George
Carlin would call Dalí’s “stuff” — including a melting clock. The museum
Chapter 15: St. Petersburg, Clearwater, and the Beaches 245

offers tours and has a little shop of oddities for souvenirs. Unless you’re a
Dalí fanatic, spending two or three hours here is plenty.
See map p. 239. 1000 Third St. S. % 727-823-3767. www.salvadordalimuseum.
org. To get there: It’s on Third Street, 10 blocks south of Central Avenue. Admission:
$13 adults, $10 seniors, $6 students over 10. Open: Mon–Sat 9:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m., Thurs
9:30 a.m.–8 p.m., Sun noon–5:30 p.m.
More cool things to see and do
You’ll find many things, beyond the city’s first-tier attractions, to occupy
your time. Best of all, some are free for the taking:
 Baseball: The Tampa Bay Devil Rays play their 81-game, regular-
season home schedule (Apr–Oct) at Tropicana Field, 16th Street at
4th Avenue South (% 866-225-6457 or 727-825-3137; www.tampa
bay.devilrays.mlb.com). Tickets run $5 to $75; parking is $4 to
$10. The Rays also play spring-training games in March at nearby
Florida Power Park at Al Lang Field (% 727-825-3137; $6–$15).
Prices at concession stands and restaurants under the dome at St.
Petersburg’s Tropicana Field are anything but civilized. Expect to
pay up to $8 for a burger, $10 to park in the same time zone, $5 or
more if you want this Bud to be for you, and $5 for those Cracker
Jacks. Heck, it’s only $6 for sushi — yes, you heard right, sushi at a
ballpark.
The average price for a family of four is about $145 for admission,
parking, and food. In fairness, though, that ranks about in the
middle of the Major League. And you can find bargains. If you’re not
affected by altitude sickness, you can shag $5 seats in the outfield
for some games. You can use the water fountain instead of the beer
or soda carts. And there’s free parking — 1 mile away — if you
don’t mind riding a shuttle.
 Beaches: Southern Pinellas County is lined with public beaches
from one end of Gulf Boulevard/Highway 699 to the other. Pass-a-
Grille and St. Pete Beach, in the south, near the Pinellas Bayway,
are popular among families and water-sports enthusiasts; there-
fore, they’re crowded. The same goes for Treasure Island, in the
middle, a west extension of Central Avenue and the Treasure Island
Causeway. Madeira Beach, on the northern end, is more laid back,
meaning there are fewer services, also fewer access points. The
beaches are free, but they do have metered parking, so bring a rea-
sonable number of quarters (the average parking charge is about
$1 an hour). Information on all the Gulf beaches can be found on
the Web at www.gulfbeaches-tampabay.com.
 Fishing: Hubbard’s Marina at John’s Pass Village and Boardwalk,
between Treasure Island and Madeira Beach (% 800-755-0677 or
727-393-1947; www.hubbardsmarina.com), offers half-day ($40) and
full-day ($72) charters aboard party boats as well as 12-hour ($83)
and overnight ($203–$230) charters. The best bet is a sunset cruise
Part IV: The Gulf Coast 
246

with free beer for $12! Grouper, amberjack, sea bass, and red snap-
per are among the rewards.
 Golf: If you want to get out your clubs while on vacation, informa-
tion on courses in the area is available on the Internet at www.
golf.com and www.floridagolfing.com. If you prefer to do your
research the old-fashioned way, request course information from
the Florida Sports Foundation (% 850-488-8347), or Florida
Golfing (% 877-222-4653). See some of the more popular courses
later in this chapter under North Pinellas and Beaches golf options.
 Parks: Fort DeSoto Park, 3500 Pinellas Bayway (% 727-866-2484),
on Mullet Key, is a 900-acre county park with a neat old Spanish-
American War–era fort (its cannons were never fired in anger). Fort
DeSoto is a good place for the kids to explore, but bring insect
repellent. The park also has playgrounds, picnic shelters, and 7
miles of beach. There’s an 85¢ toll to drive into the park. A conces-
sionaire, known as the Camp Store, rents canoes for $16 an hour or
$35 for a full day (% 727-864-1991).
Going on a guided tour
Hubbard’s Marina at John’s Pass Village and Boardwalk, halfway between
Treasure Island and Madeira Beach (% 800-755-0677 or 727-393-1947;
www.hubbardsmarina.com) offers a two-hour dolphin-watch and sight-
seeing cruise. It costs $12 for adults, $6 for kids 11 and under. There’s also
a three-hour shelling tour ($20 for adults, $10 for kids).
Shopping the local stores
Haslam’s Book Store, 2025 Central Ave., St. Petersburg (% 727-822-8616;
www.haslams.com), is a great place to browse. Dating to 1933, its collec-
tion has grown to more than 350,000 volumes, making Haslam’s Florida’s
largest bookstore.
John’s Pass Village and Boardwalk, 12901 Gulf Blvd., Madeira Beach
(% 727-394-0756) is a new, made-to-look-old shopping area that features
restaurants, galleries, saloons, and boutiques — most of which are over-
priced. It’s a nice place for a stroll and a little browsing though. A ton of
other souvenir shacks lining Gulf Boulevard peddle T-shirts, shells, and
other trinkets.
On the mall front, the area’s most notable is Tyrone Square Mall, 6901
22nd Ave. N., St. Petersburg (% 727-345-0126), which has 150 stores
anchored by Macy’s and Dillard’s.
Living it up after dark
In addition to the following listings, you can get up-to-the-minute enter-
tainment information each Thursday in the “Weekend” section of the St.
Petersburg Times (www.sptimes.com).

Bars
Ever since St. Pete started coming into its own as far as the hipster quo-
tient is concerned, cool bars started appearing as quickly as Madonna
changes her accent. Among them, A Taste for Wine, 241 Central Ave.
(% 727-895-1623), an upscale spot with polished woods and a granite
bar offering terrific by-the-glass vintages, appetizers, and a gorgeous out-
door balcony; the Haymarket Pub, 8308 4th St. N. (% 727-577-9621), the
gay-friendly Cheers of St. Pete, where audible conversation and reason-
ably priced drinks aren’t implausible demands; Janus Landing, 200 1st
Ave. N. (% 727-896-1244), a fantastic outdoor concert venue and bar
where mostly alternative and rock bands perform; Ringside Café, 2742
4th St. N. (% 727-894-8465), a laid-back jazz and blues bar; and Martini
Bar, 131 2nd Ave. N. (% 727-895-8558), where a crowd that looks as if it
stepped off the set of Sex and the City convenes for some serious seeing
and being seen.
Performing arts
The Bayfront Center and the Mahaffey Theater, 400 First St. S., St.
Petersburg (% 727-892-5767 or 727-892-5700; www.stpete.org/
mahevent.htm or www.stpete.org/bayfront.htm), present a variety
of Broadway plays, ice shows, and concerts including performances by
the Florida Orchestra.
North Pinellas and Its Beaches
The North Pinellas area isn’t Grand Tourist Central, but its beaches do a
jam-up business in summer (with families) and winter (with snowbirds).
Inland, the major cities include Clearwater, Dunedin, Largo, and Palm
Harbor. On the coast, you come across Bellair Beach, Clearwater
Beach, and Sand Key. (See the “St. Pete and Clearwater Beaches” map,
later in this chapter.) The Greek community of Tarpon Springs anchors
the north end.
Getting there
Like St. Petersburg, reaching Clearwater by the sky is best. For details on
flying in, see “Getting there” in the “St. Petersburg” section of this chapter.
If you’re coming by car, you have a choice of three routes:
 U.S. 19: The traffic on this route is beyond frustrating.
 I-75/275: This highway cuts through the center of the state from
the Florida/Georgia border, and then runs into Tampa and Pinellas
County.
 I-95/I-4/I-275: I-95 gets you into the state along the east coast,
where you can pick up I-4 in Daytona Beach and ride it onto I-275,
which takes you through Tampa into North Pinellas.

St. Pete and Clearwater Beaches

Getting around
Clearwater and the beaches primarily use a named street system, so
navigating isn’t as easy as in St. Petersburg. This is, however, a smaller
area, so getting lost is difficult. If you do take a wrong turn, remember
that the water is to the west. If you’re driving, pick up a map (see “Fast
Facts” at the end of this chapter), and you shouldn’t have a problem.
By car
U.S. 19 (known to the locals frequently ensnared in its traffic tie-ups as
#%$#!! 19) is the main north–south highway. Highway 611 runs the same
route to the far east, Alt. U.S. 19 does it to the west, and Gulf Boulevard
does it on the beach. East Bay Drive/Highway 686 (Largo), Gulf to Bay
Boulevard/Highway 60 (Clearwater), and Curlew Road/Highway 586
(Dunedin) are the primary east–west roads.
By taxi
In general, it costs $2 to get into a cab and $1.60 a mile thereafter. Yellow
Cab (% 727-799-2222) is the main company in North Pinellas.
By trolley
The tourist-friendly Suncoast Beach Trolley (% 727-530-9911), serves
St. Pete Beach and Treasure Island and runs every 30 minutes from
5 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily, until midnight Friday and Saturday. Rides cost
$1.25 per person.
By bus
The Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority (% 727-530-9911; www.psta.
net) serves the entire county. The fare is $1.25 per ride for adults, 75¢
for students, and 60¢ for seniors. Exact change is required. Unless you
don’t mind a slow, often nontourist pace, skip it.
Staying in style
Because the beaches tend to be crowded much of the year, making hotel
reservations early is wise. You can get discount packages during the
summer, so ask when you reserve your room.
The Florida Hotel Network (% 800-538-3616; www.floridahotels.com)
will make accommodations arrangements for you, if you don’t want the
hassle of haggling with motel clerks.
All the accommodations listed here offer free parking, air-conditioning,
and pools, unless otherwise noted.
Don’t forget to add 11 percent in sales and hotel taxes to your bill.

feemakers, balconies with a view of the Gulf or Bay, and Nintendo. Its sum-

the rolling links of the Carolinas than the usually flat courses found in
Florida. Kids and golf widows will love the $3.4 million Loch Ness Monster
Pool and Spa. Golf and tennis packages are available.

you can find plenty of other choices if marine cuisine doesn’t make your
mouth water. Budget-minded travelers can find a host of fast-food joints
Part IV: The Gulf Coast 
252

and chain restaurants in the tourist zones and off the main highways
that lead to the beaches. Note: All Florida restaurants and food-serving
bars are smoke-free.

The Black Pearl
$$–$$$
Dunedin
INTERNATIONAL
A creative menu is headlined by treats such as wild-mushroom ragout
ignited with Jack Daniels, cedar-plank salmon with an herb rub and lemon
horseradish sauce, Maryland lump crabmeat imperial, and veal medallions
in a vanilla-bean sauce with shiitake and crimini mushrooms. Desserts
such as black-licorice ice cream with raspberry trimmings are definitely
out of the ordinary from your typical vanilla dining experience.
See map p. 249. 315 Main St. % 727-734-3463. Reservations recommended. To get
there: Take Alt. U.S. 19 north to Main, then east to the restaurant. Main courses:

Clearwater Beach
SEAFOOD
Popular with locals and visitors in the know since 1981, this casual pub
makes the best grouper sandwiches in the area and has all the awards to
prove it. The sandwiches are fresh, thick, juicy, and delicious. The atmos-
phere is pure Florida casual style. There can be a wait during winter and
on weekends year-round. For a similarly relaxed setting, directly on the
beach, Frenchy’s Rockaway Grill, at 7 Rockaway St. (% 727-446-4844),
has a wonderful outdoor setting, and it keeps a charcoal grill going to cook
fresh fish.

Salt Rock Grill
$$
Indian Shores
STEAKS/SEAFOOD
Affluent professionals and the so-called beautiful people pack this water-
front restaurant, making it the place to see and be seen on the beaches.
The big, urbane dining room is built on three levels, thus affording every
table a view over the creeklike waterway out back. And in warm, fair
weather you can dine out by the dock or slake your thirst at the lively Tiki
bar (bands play out here Sat–Sun during the summer). Anything from the
wood-fired grill is excellent. Thick, aged steaks are the house specialties.
Pan-seared peppered tuna and salmon cooked on a cedar board lead the
seafoods. 
See map p. 249. 19325 Gulf Blvd. % 727-593-7625. Reservations accepted. To get

$9–$36. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V. Open: Mon–Thurs 4–10 p.m.,   Fri–Sat 4–11 p.m. 
Exploring Clearwater
The beaches are the main draw in this area. If you tire of the surf and
sand, however, several other attractions can help fill your time. Keep in
mind that this area’s major showstoppers are of the natural variety. So if
you prefer hanging out in museums, head into St. Petersburg.
Touring the top sights
Caladesi Island State Park
Dunedin
This 3-mile island’s résumé includes sea grasses, dunes, and a variety of
birds, including blue herons. If you’re lucky, you may see some wild dol-
phins performing off the beach, and in summer you can probably see the
crawl marks left by nesting loggerhead turtles. Cars and trucks aren’t
allowed, so noise and carbon dioxide are minimal. The park is only acces-
sible by boat, and there’s a four-hour maximum stay.
See map p. 249. 3 Causeway Blvd. % 727-469-5918. www.floridastate
parks.org/caladesiisland. To get there: Use the ferry ($8 adults, $4.50 kids
3–12, no credit cards; % 727-734-5263) from Honeymoon Island State Recreation
Area (see listing later in this section). Admission: No charge beyond the $5 for
Honeymoon Island. Open: Ferry runs hourly 10 a.m.–4:30 p.m.
Clearwater Marine Aquarium
Clearwater Beach
This aquarium is dedicated to rehabilitating or providing a permanent
home for injured marine mammals (including dolphins and otters), as well
as sea turtles. On Sundays and Mondays visitors can participate in a four-
and-a-half-hour trainer-for-a-day program. The program is limited to one
person per day and costs $125. Otherwise, allow two to three hours to see
all the exhibits.

Chapter 15: St. Petersburg, Clearwater, and the Beaches 255
Tarpon Springs: Sponge-ing up some history
Tarpon Springs calls itself “the Sponge Capital of the World.” Greek immigrants from
the Dodecanese Islands settled here in the late 19th century to harvest sponges, which
grew in abundance offshore. By the 1930s, Tarpon Springs was producing more sponges
than any other place in the world. A blight ruined the business in the 1940s, but the
descendants of those early immigrants stayed on. Today they comprise about a third of
the population, making Tarpon Springs a center of transplanted Greek culture.
Sponges still arrive at the historic Sponge Docks, on Dodecanese Boulevard. With a
lively, carnival-like atmosphere, the docks are a great place to spend an afternoon or
early evening, poking your head into shops selling sponges and other souvenirs while
Greek music comes from the dozen or so family restaurants purveying authentic
Aegean cuisine. You can also venture offshore from here because booths on the docks
hawk sightseeing and fishing cruises. Make your reservations as soon as you get here;
then go sightseeing ashore or grab a meal at one of the multitudinous Greek restau-
rants and bakeries facing the dock while waiting for the next boat to shove off.
You also can visit the tin-roofed Spongeorama (510 Dodecanese Blvd.; no phone; open
daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.), a museum dedicated to sponges and sponge divers that sells a
wide variety of sponges (they’ll ship your purchase home) and shows a 30-minute
video several times a day about sponge diving. Admission is free. A scuba diver feeds
sharks three times a day in the Konger Tarpon Springs Aquarium (850 Dodecanese
Blvd.; % 727-938-5378; open Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–5 p.m., Sun noon–5pm), at the western
end of the boulevard. Admission is $4.75 adults, $4 seniors, $2.75 for children 3–11, free
for kids under 3.
South of the docks, the Downtown Historic District sports turn-of-the-last-century
commercial buildings along Tarpon Avenue and Pinellas Avenue (Alt. U.S. 19). On
Tarpon Avenue west of Pinellas Avenue, you’ll come to the Victorian homes over-
looking Spring Bayou. This creek-side area makes for a delightfully picturesque stroll.
The Tarpon Springs Chamber of Commerce, 11 E. Orange St., Tarpon Springs, FL 34689
(% 727-937-6109; www.tarponsprings.com), has an information office on
Dodecanese Boulevard at the Sponge Docks, which is open Tuesday through Sunday
from 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
To get to Tarpon Springs from Tampa or St. Petersburg, take U.S. 19 north and turn left
on Tarpon Avenue (C.R. 582). From Clearwater Beach, take Alt. U.S. 19 north through
Dunedin. The center of the historic downtown district is at the intersection of Pinellas
Avenue (Alt. U.S. 19) and Tarpon Avenue. To reach the Sponge Docks, go 10 blocks
north on Pinellas Avenue and turn left at Pappas’ Restaurant onto Dodecanese
Boulevard.

Honeymoon Island State Recreation Area
Dunedin
Although it’s not as appealing as neighboring Caladesi Island (see earlier
listing), this public park features ospreys, mangroves, and dunes as well as
swimming, fishing, picnic areas, and bathhouses for changing. If you add
a side trip to Caladesi, this can be an all-day affair.
See map p. 249. 3 Causeway Blvd. % 727-469-5942. www.floridastateparks.
org/honeymoonisland. To get there: From Clearwater go north on U.S. 19, then
west on Curlew Road, which ends at the park. Admission: $5 per vehicle. Open: Daily
8 a.m.–dusk.
More cool things to see and do
Most folks come to this region to sample an old Florida attraction —
the shore. North Pinellas beaches are just as attractive as those in the
southern part of the county, but they are fewer in number. The star is
Clearwater Beach, the place to go if you want to see or be seen, or if
you’re seeking an abundance of water sports. 
If you can’t go on vacation without hitting the greens at least once, or if
you yearn to watch the Boys of Summer get into shape, here are a few of
your options:

tion on courses in the area is available on the Internet at www.golf.

Taking a guided tour
Starlite Cruises, 25 Causeway Blvd., Clearwater Beach (% 800-444-4814
or 727-462-2628; www.starlitecruises.com), runs two- to three-hour
sightseeing, lunch, dinner, and dancing cruises out of the Clearwater
City Marina. Prices run from $12 to $40.
Captain Memo’s Pirate Cruise also runs out of the Clearwater Marina
(% 727-446-2587; www.captainmemo.com), using a replica of a pirate
ship for sightseeing and champagne cruises that are often escorted by
dolphins. The cruises cost from $28 to $30 for adults, $23 for teens and
seniors, and $18 for kids. A $2 discount is offered if you book online.
Shopping
This is not a major shopping zone, so if you came to exercise your credit
card, go elsewhere. If you’re desperate enough, Countryside Mall, U.S.
19 and Highway 580, Clearwater (% 727-796-1079), houses 180 stores,
including Dillard’s, Burdines, and Sears.
Living it up after dark
Many of the beach’s restaurants offer some form of entertainment when
the sun goes down, including Britt’s Beachside Café (see listing under
“Dining out” earlier in this chapter), and you can find many bars in the
same area. 
Up on the northern tip of Treasure Island, Gators on the Pass (% 727-
367-8951) claims to have the world’s longest waterfront bar, with a huge
deck overlooking the waters of John’s Pass. The complex also includes a
nonsmoking sports bar and a three-story tower with a top-level observa-
tion deck for panoramic views of the Gulf of Mexico. There’s live music,
from acoustic and blues to rock, most nights.
In Clearwater Beach, the Palm Pavilion Grill & Bar, on the beach at
18 Bay Esplanade (% 727-446-2742), has live music Tuesday through
Sunday nights during winter and on weekends in the off-season. Nearby,
Frenchy’s Rockaway Grill, at 7 Rockaway St. (% 727-446-4844; www.
frenchysonline.com/rockaway.html), is another popular hangout.
Club-wise, check out two of the most popular nightspots:
 Club Liquid Blue, 22 N. Fort Harrison, Clearwater (% 727-446-
4000; www.clubliquidblue.com), is a dance, martini, and cigar
venue that features DJs and, on some nights, live radio.
 Shephard’s Tiki Bar, 601 S. Gulfview Blvd., Clearwater Beach
(% 727-442-5107), features live reggae, rock ’n’ roll, and more, with
a cover of $7 to $15.
On the performing-arts front, Ruth Eckerd Hall, 1111 McMullen Booth
Rd., Clearwater (% 727-791-7400; www.rutheckerdhall.com), ranks as
Chapter 15: St. Petersburg, Clearwater, and the Beaches 257

one of the state’s finest centers, with music, dance, and other varied per-
formances during the year.
For more information on cultural offerings, the St. Petersburg Times
(% 727-893-8111; www.sptimes.com) puts out an entertainment and
dining guide called “Weekend” each Thursday.
Day-Tripping to Weeki Wachee, Homosassa
Springs, and Crystal River
Kitschy, old Florida is alive and well in these parts.
Weeki Wachee Springs (% 877-469-3354; www.weekiwachee.com)
opened in 1947 and still features its “mermaid” shtick. It’s a sight to
see the mermaids doing their dances in waters that come from one of
America’s most prolific freshwater springs, pouring some 170 million gal-
lons of 72°F (22°C) water a day into the river. There’s more than mer-
maids here; you can take a Wilderness River Cruise across the Weeki
Wachee River and send the kids on the flume ride at Buccaneer Bay, the
water-park part of the attraction. The springs are open to scuba divers,
too. Weeki Wachee is at U.S. 19 and Highway 50, 45 miles north of
Clearwater, and is open from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. in winter (until 6 p.m. in
summer) daily. Admission costs $20 for adults, $16 for kids 3 to 10.
Just 15 miles north of Weeki Wachee, Homosassa Springs State Wildlife
Park, 4150 U.S. 19 (% 352-628-5343; www.citrusdirectory.com/
hsswp), lets you see manatees without getting wet. A permanent home
and rehabilitation center for injured manatees, the park also has an
underwater observatory where you get another angle on the marine
mammals as well as thousands of fish. Nature trails wind through the
habitats of several other permanent residents, including eagles, owls,
red-tailed hawks, river otters, and a black bear. The park is open from
9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. Admission includes a 30-minute narrated boat ride
and costs $9 for adults, $5 for kids 3 to 12.
If you want to take a swim with some manatees, you can do so in Crystal
River, 7 miles north of Homosassa Springs. Its warm springs and federal
sanctuaries attract these slow-moving, endangered marine mammals
every winter, from November to March. Manatees also reside in some of
the local rivers during the warmer months. A number of dive shops on
U.S. 19 in Crystal River offer sightseeing and snorkeling tours beginning
at $25 or $30. They also rent fins, masks, and wet suits.
If you choose to do only one of the preceding activities, you can do it
in a long day-trip from St. Petersburg, lasting from five to seven hours.
You can get information by calling % 800-587-6667 or logging onto www.
visitcitrus.com. You can also contact the Citrus County Chamber of
Commerce, 28 NW Highway 19, Crystal River (% 352-795-3149).

 Retreating to the beaches in the Land of 10,000 Islands
H
ave you ever heard about the green flash? It’s a brief, brilliant flare
that occurs as the last tip of the sun disappears beneath the hori-
zon. Although they’re very rare, you may be able to see one when you
visit the southwestern coast of Florida. Meteorologists say that a green
flash requires just the right atmospheric brew (heavy on the greens,
light on the reds) for the setting sun to ignite this explosion of color. It
also takes a flat horizon and cloudless sky. If everything adds up, a green
flash probably will steal your breath.
But even if you don’t see a flash, you can still find plenty to write home
about. The Sarasota–Fort Myers–Naples region of Florida is called the
Land of 10,000 Islands. That may be a stretch, but there are a lot of them,
and most have never met a bulldozer. If you like civilization, well, don’t
fret about that, either. You can find plenty to fill your date book here.
Southwest Florida: What’s Where?
Down south, Florida’s Collier County, which includes Naples and Marco
Island, woos more millionaires per capita than any other county east of
the Mississippi. While you’re in town, you can cruise Millionaire’s Row
in Olde Naples, as well as some of the boutiques and galleries that keep
the rich from getting too idle.
Thirty miles north, Fort Myers and Fort Myers Beach are as quiet and
quaint as they were when Thomas Edison and Henry Ford built their
winter homes here. Just offshore, Sanibel and Captiva are two of the
region’s island gems.

Sarasota, which is the home of the Asolo Theatre and Ringling Museum,
is this region’s largest city. Offshore, more than 40 miles of gloriously
white beaches fringe a chain of barrier islands that stretch from
Sarasota to Tampa Bay, including St. Armands, Longboat, and Lido keys.
On the downside, the Sarasota–Fort Myers–Naples region is spread far
and wide. Very few activities take up an entire day, and you’ll occasion-
ally have to drive for a spell before reaching your next stop.
Sarasota and Bradenton
Sarasota caters to its residents with a wide variety of cultural attractions
and events. Thanks to its theaters and performing-arts centers, the city
has grown into an upscale retirement community, similar to Marco Island
and, to a lesser degree, Naples to the south. (Skip ahead to the map for
an overview of “Sarasota and Bradenton.”) Bradenton, Sarasota’s often-
overlooked neighbor, remains more of a casual fishing village and blue-
collar town.
Getting there
The cities’ location on the south side of Tampa Bay means that coming
here is best by air, but I also give options for people who prefer to leave
their feet on the ground.
By plane
Sarasota-Bradenton International Airport (% 941-359-2770; www.srq-
airport.com) 3 miles (a $5 cab ride) north of downtown off University
Parkway between U.S. 41 and U.S. 301, is served by a half-dozen major
airlines or their partners, including Continental, Delta, Northwest, TWA,
and US Airways. Alamo, Avis, Budget, Dollar, Hertz, and National have
rental counters in the terminal. 
Another option is to fly into Tampa International (% 813-870-8700;
www.tampaairport.com), which is about one and a half to two hours
north of Sarasota. Because Tampa International offers more arrival and
departure choices (see Chapter 14 for more information), you often get a
better airfare — and cheaper car-rental prices — here.
By car
I-75 is the primary route into Sarasota from the north, and it’s about five
to six hours from the Florida-Georgia line to Sarasota. If you prefer I-95,
take it to Daytona Beach and then follow I-4 to I-75 before heading south.
Getting around
Start by getting a map, which you can get from the information sources
listed in “Fast Facts” at the end of this chapter.

Sarasota and Bradenton

Chapter 16: Sarasota, Fort Myers, and Naples 263
By car
U.S. 301 and U.S. 41/Tamiami Trail are the major north–south arteries on
the mainland; the Gulf-to-Mexico Drive (Highway 789) is the main island
road. The largest east–west thoroughfares in Sarasota are Highway 72
(Stickney Point Road), Highway 780, University Parkway, and (to the
islands) Ringling Causeway, which deposits you on Lido Beach. Highway
70 (53rd Avenue), Highway 684 (Cortez Road), and Highway 64 (Manatee
Avenue) are the main roads in Bradenton.
By taxi
Taxi companies include Yellow Cab (% 941-955-3341), Green Cab 
(% 941-922-6666), and Diplomat Taxi (% 941-359-8294). The standard
fare is $2.10 plus $1.50 per mile.
By public transit
Sarasota County Area Transit, or SCAT (% 941-316-1234), runs regu-
larly scheduled bus service. A 50¢ fare will take you to stops in the city
and St. Armands, Longboat, and Lido keys. It runs from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Monday through Saturday. It’s not NYC-caliber public transportation,
but it works and it’s cheap.
Staying in style
The beaches in this area are loaded with condominiums, but you can
find a number of other lodging options. In downtown Sarasota and on
U.S. 41, just south of the airport, you can find several modern chain
hotels. See the “Quick Concierge” at the back of the book for hotel reser-
vation numbers and Web sites.
You can leave the reserving to someone else by contacting the Florida
Hotel Network (% 800-538-3616; www.floridahotels.com). You can
also call the free reservation service operated by the Bradenton Area
Convention and Visitors Bureau at % 800-4-MANATEE.
High season here runs from January to April, but rates along the
beaches remain high year-round, so if you’re looking for a bargain, stick
to the downtown area.
Don’t forget Sarasota’s 10 percent and Bradenton’s 9 percent hotel tax.
The top hotels
The Cypress
$$–$$$
South Sarasota
The Cypress is a two-story, tin-roofed inn tucked away amidst giant mango
trees and hovering palms, among other lush forms of vegetation. Best of
all, it overlooks the bay. You can’t get much better than this, with antiques,

floors, ceiling fans, and Oriental rugs.

Ritz-Carlton Sarasota
$$$–$$$$
Sarasota
The Ritz occupies the bottom ten floors of an 18-story, Mediterranean-style
building (the top floors are private residencies). It sits perpendicular to
the bay, so most of the spacious guest units have views looking across the
water to the keys and the Gulf. The rooms are luxuriously appointed in
typical Ritz-Carlton fashion, including marble bathrooms. The elegantly
appointed lobby opens to a bay-side courtyard with a heated pool. There
is no beach on-site, but a shuttle will take you to Lido Key, where the hotel
debuted its own private beach club in January 2004. There’s also a full-

Dining out 
A veritable bounty of upscale restaurants caters to the tastes of Sarasota
locals, but there are also plenty of places to dine that won’t put a king-
size dent in your budget. As in most Florida cities, your best bet is to
stick to local seafood, which is almost always fresh and well prepared.
Note: All Florida restaurants and food-serving bars are smoke-free.
Don’t forget to allow for the 7 percent sales tax.

Blasé Café
$–$$
Siesta Key
INTERNATIONAL
Tongue in cheeky, to say the least, this restaurant doesn’t take itself seri-
ously, hence the ironic and oxymoronic name. One of Florida’s most
unusual restaurants, Ralph and Cindy Cole’s supercasual establishment
has tables indoors and a few under the cover of the Village Corner shop-
ping center’s walkway, but most are alfresco, on a wooden deck built
around a palm tree in the center’s asphalt parking lot. This is Siesta Key’s
best breakfast spot, offering Italian- and Louisiana-flavored frittatas as well
as plain old bacon and eggs. Lunch sees burgers, big salads, and platters
such as chicken Alfredo and Florentine crepes with shrimp. At night, Ralph
puts forth the likes of pan-seared, sushi-quality yellowfin tuna with tangy
wasabi and pickled ginger. You can while away the rest of the evening in
the wine bar, where the Coles have installed the original bar from the Don
CeSar Beach Resort & Spa in St. Pete Beach. There’s also live music in there
on weekends.
See map p. 262. 5263 Ocean Blvd. % 941-349-9822. Reservations recommended. To
get there: In the Village Corner at Calle Miramar. Main courses: $10–$23; breakfast
and lunch $5–$9. MC, V. Open: Mon–Thurs 8:30 a.m.–9:30 p.m., Fri–Sat 8:30 a.m.–
10 p.m. Closed Mon June–Nov. 
Euphemia Haye/The Haye Loft
$$–$$$
Longboat Key
CONTINENTAL
FYI: A Euphemia Haye isn’t a chichi culinary creation, but, rather, the
grandmother of the restaurant’s founder. Another highly praised estab-
lishment, this restaurant combines a great menu (peppered and pan-fried
steak, snapper baked in a pistachio crust), an incredible ambience, and an
extensive wine list. Whatever you do, do not miss Euphemia Prime
Peppered Steak (whose famous sauce is now available for purchase). If all
this sounds sweet, wait until you go upstairs to The Haye Loft, the casual
dessert bar. Up here you can take your pick from fabulous pies topped with
thick whipped cream or Ben & Jerry’s ice cream. You can also sample the
kitchen’s offerings, for the loft has its own light-fare menu, including soups,
appetizers, small pizzas, and sandwiches. 
See map p. 262. 5540 Gulf of Mexico Dr. % 941-383-3633. Reservations suggested. To

Michael Klauber’s chic bistro is one of Sarasota’s top places for fine dining
and is the locals’ favorite after-theater haunt. Huge cut-glass walls create

Exploring Sarasota and Bradenton
Visitors won’t find any theme parks here, but there is a nice mix of
things to do for plant, animal, and art lovers.
The top attractions
Mote Marine Laboratory
Longboat Key
Stare into a shark’s eye or count a barracuda’s teeth. Meet manatees
named Hugh and Buffett, enjoy a 30-foot touch tank, and find out a lot about
nature in the river and estuary displays. Don’t forget to stick your head

Part IV: The Gulf Coast

wounded birds. There’s a viewing area, hospital, recovery and rehabilita-
tion areas, and a gift shop. You can adopt a pelican for $25. When you go,
the pelican stays (but you get a picture). Allow an hour.

Sarasota’s Big Top. Combined, the Baroque Art Gallery, Museum of the
Circus, and the Ringling residence, Ca’d’Zan, house a ton of European and
American art, including works by Rubens, Van Dyck, and Poussin. The
Circus Museum exhibits artifacts such as 19th- and early 20th-century
posters, costumes, beautifully carved parade wagons, and more. Ca’d’Zan
(House of John) itself is a grand terra-cotta palace of stained glass, whim-
sical carvings, and personal mementos of John and Mable Ringling. Plan on
spending about four hours if you want to see everything.

More cool things to see and do
If you have special interests or just want to work on your tan, you can
find many other options for occupying your time. Here are some ideas:
 Baseball: The Pittsburgh Pirates (% 941-747-3031; www.pittsburgh
pirates.com), use McKechnie Field, 17th Avenue and Ninth Street
West, for training camp. Tickets cost $6 to $9. The Cincinnati Reds
(% 941-954-4464 or 941-334-3309; www.cincinnatireds.com)
pitch their tents at Sarasota’s Ed Smith Stadium, 2700 12th St.
Tickets run $5 to $12. Workouts begin in mid-February, and games
are played through March.
 Beaches: Swim in several places located along the barrier islands,
from Holmes Beach to Casey Key. Although Sarasota’s Siesta Beach
is just a quarter of a mile long, it’s also 500-feet wide. The sand
granules are soft and squeaky under your toes, and the Gulf’s waters
soothe. Go west on Highway 72 over U.S. 41 and the Intracoastal
Waterway to the end at Midnight Pass, and then turn right. The
beach is free; although there are 800 free parking spots, they go
fast, so get here early.
 Fishing: The Flying Fish Fleet (% 941-366-3373; www.flyingfish
fleet.com), at Marina Jack’s, U.S. 41 at Island Circle, Sarasota,
offers half-day rates of $30 for adults and $18 for kids under 15 
on big boats, and $395 for private charters (up to six people).
 Gardens: Selby Botanical Gardens, 811 South Palm Ave., Sarasota
(% 941-366-5731; www.selby.org), has been called a “supernova
in the constellation of botanical gardens.” The star attraction is 
the collection of more than 6,000 orchids. In addition. the 11-acre
complex has an open-air museum of some 20,000 colorful plants.
Admission costs $12 for adults and $6 for kids 6 to 11. The gardens
are open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily.
 Golf: The Bobby Jones Golf Complex, 1000 Circus Blvd., Sarasota
(% 941-365-4653), is a 45-hole municipal course where greens fees
run under $25 year-round. The Legacy Golf Club, 8255 Legacy Blvd.,
Chapter 16: Sarasota, Fort Myers, and Naples 269

Bradenton (% 941-907-7067; www.legacygolfclub.com), has
sand and water hazards on all 18 of its holes. Greens fees run $$40
to $99. Tatum Ridge Golf Links, 421 Tatum Rd., Sarasota (% 941-
378-4211), has 18 holes set among wetlands. Greens fees here run
under $25 in summer, and $25 to $40 during the winter.
Shopping
Although the area offers little in terms of unique merchandise, Sarasota
does have a unique shopping district. St. Armands Circle on St. Armands
Key is a fun place to window-shop or splurge a little (more like a lot —
you pay more here than in other areas). An outdoor zone of 150 trendy
shops, art galleries, and cafes, the circle is on a par with Worth Avenue
in Palm Beach and Park Avenue in Winter Park. To get there, follow
Highway 780 across the Ringling Causeway until you see the circle. For
more information, call % 941-388-1554.
Living it up after dark
In addition to the following listings, the Sarasota Herald-Tribune (% 941-
953-7755; www.newscoast.com/xwelcome.cfm) publishes a Friday
entertainment edition called “Ticket.” The Bradenton Herald (% 941-
748-0411; bradenton.com) features “The Weekender” on Friday.
Bars and clubs
The HayeLoft atop the Euphemia Haye restaurant, 5540 Gulf of Mexico
Dr., Longboat Key (% 941-383-3633; www.euphemiahaye.com), offers
live jazz Friday through Tuesday and blues on Wednesday and Thursday.
You can find plenty of music to dance to on the mainland at Sarasota
Quay, the downtown waterfront dining-shopping-entertainment complex
on Tamiami Trail (U.S. 41), a block north of John Ringling Causeway. Just
walk around this brick building and your ears will take you to the action.
The laser sound-and-light crowd gathers at In Extremis (% 941-954-2008),
where a high-energy DJ spins Top 40 tunes for 20-somethings. Michael’s
Mediterranean Grill turns into Anthony’s After Dark rocking disco at
10:30 p.m. An older but still energetic crowd dances to contemporary
jazz at the Downunder Jazz Bar (% 941-951-2467). In Siesta Key Village,
The Old Salty Dog, 5023 Ocean Blvd. (% 941-349-0158), offers a fabu-
lous selection of British ales and a lovely outdoor patio.
Performing arts
The FSU Center for the Performing Arts, 5555 N. Tamiami Trail/U.S. 41,
Sarasota (% 800-361-8388 or 941-351-8000; www.asolo.org), is the
home of the Asolo Theatre, Florida’s official state theater. The center’s
large and small stages present various performances throughout the
year. There’s also an actors-in-training program. Tickets to performances
run from $13 to $39.
The Van Wezel Performing Arts Center, 777 N. Tamiami Trail/U.S. 41,
Sarasota (% 941-953-3366; www.vanwezel.org), commands the bay-
Part IV: The Gulf Coast 
270

front skyline with a seashell-shaped hall. The acoustics here are great,
and year-round programs range from ballet to jazz and musical comedy.
The Sarasota Ballet (% 941-351-8000; www.sarasotaballet.org) per-
forms at the center from October to April, and it also stages perform-
ances at the FSU Center. Tickets cost $11 to $45.
Fort Myers, Sanibel, Naples, 
and Marco Island
Marco Island and, to a lesser degree, Naples can stake a legitimate claim
to being west Florida’s wealthiest areas per capita. Meanwhile, Fort
Myers Beach and its island neighbors — Sanibel and Captiva — are
among the area’s most popular tourist magnets. Tough zoning laws and
efforts to protect the local ecology should help keep the area’s natural
wonders, if not untouched, then certainly unspoiled. Don’t come here
looking for beach-blanket bacchanalia, à la spring break in Daytona. But
for ample sun, R&R, and places that close well before midnight, this is
the place. Travels in this half of the chapter stay close to the coast. (See
the “Fort Myers, Sanibel, and Naples” map in this chapter.)
If you’re interested in heading farther south to see the Everglades,
check out Chapter 12.
Getting there
Most out-of-state visitors opt to fly here. Southwest Florida International
Airport in Fort Myers (% 941-768-4700; www.swfia.com) is served by
about two dozen American, Canadian, and European airlines or their
partners, including Continental, Delta, Northwest/KLM, TWA, US
Airways, Air Canada, and LTU International (see the “Quick Concierge”
at the back of this book for telephone-number and Web-site informa-
tion). Alamo, Avis, Budget, Dollar, Hertz, and National have desks at
the airport. Superior Airport Shuttle (% 888-397-9571 or 941-267-4777;
www.superiorairportshuttle.com) can get you to most southwest
Florida destinations from the airport. Here are a few one-way rates for
up to three passengers: Fort Myers, $16 to $35; Sanibel and Captiva, $37
to $56; Naples, $38 to $56; and Marco Island, $56 to $70.
If you do decide to come by car (and I can’t recommend it), expect a
seven- to eight-hour drive from the Florida-Georgia state line. I-75 is the
primary route from the north. If you prefer to drive in from the East
Coast, take I-95 to Daytona Beach; then take I-4 to I-75 and head south.
(See the “Fort Myers, Sanibel, and Naples” map, in this chapter.)
Getting around
Top to bottom, this area is about 60 miles long, though the tourist zones
pretty much hug the coastline and barrier islands. Unless you’re going to
be relatively stationary, you need to have a car.

Map Area
FLORIDA
Fort Myers, Sanibel, and Naples

By car
U.S. 41/Cleveland Avenue/Tamiami Trail is the primary north–south road
on the mainland. Highway 865/Estero Boulevard runs between Fort
Myers Beach and Bonita Beach. Highway 78/Pine Island Road connects
that island with North Fort Myers, while Highway 867/McGregor
Boulevard leads the way from Fort Myers to Sanibel and Captiva.
You definitely need a map to navigate the area. Good maps are available
from the sources listed in “Fast Facts” at the end of this chapter.
By taxi
Yellow Cab (% 941-332-1055 in Fort Myers and % 941-262-1312 in
Naples) is the major taxi company in the area. Fares cost $2.75 to $3.75
for the first mile and $1.50 per mile thereafter (for up to five passengers).
By trolley
The Naples Trolley (% 941-262-7300) makes 25 stops in the downtown
and the beach area and allows riders to get on and off the trolley through-
out the entire day. Fares run $17 for adults and $7 for kids 3 to 12.
By bus
Buses should be used only as a last resort because in most cases they
cater to commuters, not tourists. Lee Tran (% 941-275-8726), operates
buses in the Fort Myers and beach areas from 6 a.m. to 9:45 p.m. Monday
through Saturday. The fare is $1 for adults, 50¢ for seniors, and kids under
42 inches get on free. 
Staying in style
As with the rest of South Florida, room rates are highest in the winter,
and even motels far removed from the beaches charge premium rates
from mid-December through April (although Jan sees somewhat lower
rates in Sanibel and Captiva). Rates drop by as much as 50 percent
during the off season, so if you’re on a tight budget, the timing of your
vacation is crucial. 
Also, keep in mind that hotels can pack in the crowds during high
season, so make sure to reserve a room well in advance.
Accommodations in southwest Florida range from small motels to con-
dominiums to major resorts. Fort Myers is home to a branch of seemingly
every chain hotel on the planet, Sanibel offers a host of old-fashioned
cottages and condominiums, and Naples has some of the most expensive
resorts in the region, such as the hyperswank Ritz-Carlton Golf Resort
featuring the Greg Norman–designed Tiburon golf course (www.ritz
carlton.com), and the revamped LaPlaya Beach and Golf Resort (www.
laplayaresort.com).
Chapter 16: Sarasota, Fort Myers, and Naples 273

Several reservation services can help get you decent rates or find you a
hotel room during a particularly busy time of year. The Lee Island Coast
Visitor and Convention Bureau operates a free reservation service 
(% 800-237-6444) that covers lodging in the Fort Myers and Sanibel areas.
Sanibel and Captiva Central Reservations, Inc. (% 800-325-1352; www.
sanibel-captivarents.com) can book you into condos and cottages
on the islands. Florida Hotel Network (% 800-538-3616; www.florida
hotels.com) can make arrangements for you in many locations in
Southwest Florida.
Remember: Sales and hotel taxes add 9 percent to your bill.
The top hotels
Hotel Escalante
$$–$$$$
Naples
The closest thing to Italy that you’ll find in Naples, Florida, this 71-room
Mediterranean villa–style hotel is only blocks away from the beach and
worlds away from the hustle and bustle of the real world, ensconced in 4
acres of lush, private gardens. A swimming pool, Jacuzzi, spa and workout
room are enough to distract you from walking around the corner and
spending money on swanky Fifth Avenue. Although there’s no on-site
restaurant, the hotel will be happy to suggest one of the 15 restaurants
located within walking distance.
See map p. 272. 290 Fifth Ave. S. % 877-485-3466. Fax: 239-262-8748. www.hotel
escalante.com. To get there: Take 1-75 west towards Naples. Exit at #15 (CR-951)
and go left. Turn right onto Davis Boulevard and then right onto East Fifth Avenue
South. Hotel is 1⁄3 mile up on the left. Free parking. Rack rates: Oct–Apr $195–$655,
May–Sept $165–$400. AE, DISC, MC, V.
The Inn on Fifth
$$–$$$$
Old Naples
This former bank building still exudes that old-money, old-world European
charm, but it’s hardly stuffy. Located on the somewhat happening Fifth
Avenue South, The Inn features 87 large guest rooms elegantly decorated
with rich, warm tones—the antithesis of Florida decor, frankly. French
doors opening to a balcony or terrace may not reveal the ocean, but you
will see either the lovely pool or “action” on the Avenue. The one draw-
back of this place is that it’s six blocks away from the beach, but that’s
hardly a big deal. McCable’s Irish Pub downstairs is a hotbed of activity,
featuring live music, a fabulous beer selection, and a youngish contingency
of revelers.

www.naplesinn.com. To get there: Pine Ridge Road to U.S. 41, south 5 miles to
Fifth, go right 21⁄2 blocks. Free valet and self-parking. Rack rates: Winter $250–$300;
off season $130–$180. AE, CB, DC, DISC, MC, V.

LaPlaya Beach & Golf Resort
$$$–$$$$
Naples
There is certainly no dearth of beach resorts in Naples, but what is con-
spicuously missing — that is until now — has been a more intimate beach
resort, directly on the beach, in which you don’t feel underdressed or
socially inappropriate when walking through the lobby in a bathing-suit
cover-up. Located on pristine Vanderbilt Beach, LaPlaya Beach & Golf
Resort has filled the void with plush, beautifully decorated rooms over-
looking the Gulf and bay (all have a private balcony), a spectacular 4,500-
square-foot spa, and a sprawling, scenic, and challenging Bob Cupp–
designed golf club and the David Leadbetter Golf Academy for the novices.
But let’s get back to the rooms for a minute. The French-country decor and
goose-down pillows are hardly what you’d expect at a beach resort, but
there’s the rub! You’ll find none of that cookie-cutter, as-seen-in-Martha-
Stewart-Living stuff here.

Marco Island Marriott Resort and Golf Club
$$$–$$$$
Marco Island
Marco Island is far from Disney World, so if you plan to bring your kids
while you experience the utmost in R&R, the Marco Island Marriott will
help entertain them with a summer camp’s worth of activities, from water
sports and Everglades excursions to bingo and “dive-in” movies in the
pool. Parents can play, too, or they can opt for the hotel’s convenient
nanny service. A $55 million renovation has spruced up the 735 guest rooms
and 8 restaurants and lounges and added a par-72 golf course located
seven minutes away, as well as a 24,000-square-foot Balinese-style spa.

The Naples Beach Hotel & Golf Club
$$–$$$$
Naples
This hospitable, beachy-keen resort is unique — family-owned since 1946.
Despite its modern amenities, the hotel is decidedly retro-looking, imper-
vious to the sterile minimalism that has invaded most hotels today. Its 
318 tropically decorated rooms are large and comfortable, sporting data-

ports, minibars, and balconies. Set on 125 acres, the resort has a spa that’s
a lot more modern than the fabulous ’50s-esque ambience of the hotel
itself, a kids’ club that offers free activities for children ages 5 to 12, and a
front-row view of the Gulf of Mexico that’s usually standing room only on
Sunday afternoons when the hotel’s pool bar turns into a happening
happy-hour spot.

Dining out 
The good news is that restaurants in the affluent areas of Southwest
Florida — especially the islands — couldn’t afford to stay in business if
they didn’t churn out good food. So if fine dining tickles your fancy, your
luck runneth over. And you don’t need to be a millionaire to feast like
one, although a bulging wallet certainly helps. Those travelers on very
tight budgets, or in search of that must-have Big Mac, can find chain
restaurants and fast-food joints strung along U.S. 41 from Fort Myers all
the way to Naples. Note: All Florida restaurants and food-serving bars
are smoke-free.
Don’t forget to allow for the 7 percent sales tax.
The Bubble Room 
$$–$$$
Captiva
STEAK/SEAFOOD
Imagine Walt Disney on acid and you’ll understand where the Bubble Room
is coming from. The kitschiest restaurant you’ll probably ever find, the
Bubble Room’s tongue-in-cheeky American cuisine is complemented by a
decor that’s filled with Christmas and Hollywood memorabilia from the
’30s, ’40s, and ’50s. Distracting, to say the least — but in a very good way.
The Bubble Room makes it hard to decide which is cooler, the Henny
Young-One boneless breast of young chicken, the prime ribs Weissmuller,
or the thousands of movie stills, puppets, antique jukeboxes, or toy trains.
Note: Readers have complained about the “awful” food here, but I still

think The Bubble Room is fun, with good (though admittedly not fabulous)
food and a great atmosphere.

Fort Myers Beach
SEAFOOD
Try this waterfront restaurant for a scenic lunch or a romantic evening
out. Every seat in the house has a view of Hurricane Bay and its passing
boats. In fact, most people come here by boat, lured by the locally caught
seafood and northern Italian fare. (Don’t worry, you can still drive here,
too.) The menu offers creative twists on seafood dishes. House specialties
include a scrumptious grouper topped with shrimp and poached in parch-
ment paper, and honey-and-bacon grilled shrimp. But whether you’ve
come by land or by sea, the surf and turf, with filet mignon and lobster tail,
is the reason to make your mark here.

Exploring Fort Myers, Sanibel, 
Naples, and Marco Island
You may not find many major attractions in this area of Florida, but if
you like old things, animals, and the great outdoors, you can still find
plenty to do.
The top attractions
Babcock Wilderness Adventures
Punta Gorda
One of the easiest and most informative ways to see Southwest Florida’s
abundant wildlife is on Babcock’s “swamp buggy” ride. Experienced natu-
ralists lead 90-minute tours through the Babcock Ranch, the largest con-
tiguous cattle operation east of the Mississippi River and home to
countless birds and wildlife (including panthers and alligators) as well as
domesticated bison and quarter horses. Unlike most wildlife tours in the
region, this one covers five different ecosystems, from open prairie to
cypress swamp. If you’d rather tour the area using pedal power, three-hour
off-road bicycle tours are also offered. Note: Advance reservations are
required for all tours. Allow two-plus hours in addition to driving time. (It’s
45 minutes north of Fort Myers.)
See map p. 272. 8000 Hwy. 31. % 800-500-5583. www.babcockwilderness.com.
To get there: On Highway 31 off Highway 80, east of I-75. Admission: $18 adults, $11

cast of lions, leopards, spotted hyenas, and African wild dogs. At Safari
Canyon, ocelots, water monitors, and more star in a show supplemented
by video presentations about the animals and their habitats. The zoo also
offers boat rides, primate islands, and close encounters with kangaroos,

Edison and Ford Winter Homes
Fort Myers
Who knew that Fort Myers was such a hotbed of industrial geniuses?
Thomas Edison and Henry Ford had winter homes here, and were both
neighbors and friends. Edison spent winters in what he dubbed “Seminole
lodge” from 1886 to 1931. The 14-acre riverfront estate includes his lab,
garden, vintage cars, and 200 phonographs. Ford arrived at his 3-acre
estate in 1916. His home, known as “Mangoes,” has a 1914 Model T and a
1917 Model T Truck. Guided and self-guided tours are available. Plan to
spend two to three hours here.

coral, get blown away in the Hurricane Experience, and get lost in the
Amazing Maze. Allow two hours to see all the exhibits.

Naples Museum of Art
Naples
If anything demonstrates the emerging sophistication of a sleepy seaside
town, it’s this three-story, 30,000-square-foot art museum, attached to the
Naples Philharmonic Center for the Arts. The first full-scale art museum
in Southwest Florida, the Naples Museum of Art features 15 different galleries
with paintings, sculptures, and drawings. Major permanent collections
concentrate on American modern and ancient Chinese art, while touring
shows and exhibitions bring welcome eclecticism to the museum. The
structure is a dramatic work of art itself, with 14-foot entrance gates and
a 90-x-45-foot glass dome. Tuesdays through Saturdays October through
May, the museum offers free guided tours at 11 a.m. and 2 p.m.

Olde Naples
Naples
This city grew up around a beach and boat pier. Some of the homes built
by well-to-do Northerners in the early part of the 20th century remain
today. Millionaire’s Row, a long, palm-studded block of these fabulous
houses, runs from Gulf Shore Boulevard to the beach. In addition to its rich
architecture, the tree-lined district offers clubs, shops, restaurants and
sidewalk cafes, boutique hotels, a 1,000-foot fishing pier, and a sugar-sand
beach. Some of the area’s highlights include Palm Cottage, 137 12th Ave.
S. (% 941-261-8164), built in 1895 and now the home of the Collier County
Historical Society, which maintains it as a museum filled with authentic
furniture, paintings, photographs, and other memorabilia and offers tours
(winter only) Monday through Friday from 1 to 3:30 p.m. (adults $5, kids
12 and under free); and Old Marine Marketplace at Tin City, 1200 Fifth
Ave. S., an old oyster-processing plant that’s now the home of 40 or so
shops and restaurants. Plan to spend four to six hours here, depending on
your tolerance for browsing and, of course, the heat factor.
Olde Naples reaches north from 12th Avenue South to Central and west from Ninth
Street to the Gulf of Mexico.
Teddy Bear Museum
Naples
In addition to 4,000 stuffed bears from around the globe, this museum has
a gift shop if you feel the urge to bring home something huggable. Unless
you’re a teddy fanatic, you can see everything in about 90 minutes.

More cool things to see and do
Here are some more ways to fill your days, especially if you’re a sports
or outdoors enthusiast:
 Baseball: The Texas Rangers play at Charlotte County Stadium in
Port Charlotte, 2300 El Jobean Rd. (% 941-625-9500; www.texas
rangers.com). Tickets cost $7 to $9. The Boston Red Sox take the
field at City of Palms Park, 2201 Edison Ave., Fort Myers (% 941-
334-4700; www.bostonredsox.com), and seeing a game sets you
back $10 to $11. The Minnesota Twins play at Hammond Stadium
in the Lee County Sports Complex, 14100 Six Mile Cypress Pkwy.,
Fort Myers (% 800-338-9467; www.minnesotatwins.com), and
Chapter 16: Sarasota, Fort Myers, and Naples 281

Part IV: The Gulf Coast 
282
tickets run $9 to $12. Workouts begin in mid-February, with games
played through March.
 Beaches, parks, and preserves: Rare plants and animals, as well as
miles of plush sands, are the big attractions here:
• The Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary, 375 Sanctuary Rd., Naples
(% 941-348-9151), is an 11,000-acre preserve with a 21⁄4-mile
boardwalk running through the prairie and hammock homes
of wild orchids, wood storks, and virgin bald cypresses, some
of which are 500 years old. Admission costs $10 adults, $6
kids 6 to 18.
• The beach at Delnor-Wiggins Pass State Recreation Area,
11100 Gulf Shore Dr., Naples (% 941-597-6196; www.florida
stateparks.org/delnor-wiggins), has been listed among
America’s top ten stretches of sand. The swimming is good,
but stay out of the pass to avoid undertows. The park’s
boardwalks lead to nature areas that boast flora and fauna
that other parts of Florida have lost: sea oats, sea grapes,
cabbage palms, wading birds, manatees, and loggerhead
turtle nests. Rangers provide nature tours throughout the
year, with the most interesting during the loggerhead nesting
season from June to October (call or check the Web site for
schedules). Admission is $4 per car.
• J.N. “Ding” Darling National Wildlife Refuge, 1 Wildlife Dr.,
Sanibel (% 941-472-1100), is Sanibel Island’s finest hour, a
6,000-acre preserve that offers 2 miles of footpaths through
sea grapes, sabal palms, and mangroves that provide homes
to spoonbills, mangrove cuckoos, alligators, and a few
American crocodiles. You can also view nature from your car
by taking a one–way, 5-mile Wildlife Drive. The visitor center
sells Wildlife Drive maps and shows videos about the park’s
wildlife. Admission is $5 for vehicles.
 Fishing: The main event happens in mid-July, when hundreds of
anglers arrive in Boca Grande for the World’s Richest Tarpon
Tournament (% 941-964-2283) and a shot at the $100,000 grand
prize. Small party charter rates start at about $250 per half-day and
$450 for a full day (for up to six people). You can find guides
through the Boca Grande Fishing Guides Association (% 941-964-
1711), Jensen’s Marina on Captiva Island (% 941-472-5800), Naples
City Boat Dock in Olde Naples (% 941-434-4693), and Cedar Bay
Marina on Marco Island (% 800-906-2628 or 941-394-9333).
 Golf: With more than 90 golf courses in the Collier County area, 
you won’t have to look far for a fore-some. You can find local golf
information on the Web at www.golf.com and www.florida
golfing.com, or request information from the Florida Sports

Foundation (% 850-488-8347) or Florida Golfing (% 877-222-

Going on a guided tour
Several tour companies offer visitors a chance to explore Naples and its
surroundings. Some of the sightseeing options in this corner of Florida
also give you a chance to experience the Everglades, but for a deeper
look at this wonderful wilderness, see Chapter 12.
By air
Casablanca Air in Naples (% 941-431-1133; www.casablancaair.com)
offers biplane tours out of Naples Municipal Airport, 160 Aviation Blvd.,
including one where you get to take the controls. Tours cost $70 to $205.

modern plane. All these tours last 15 to 30 minutes; destinations include
the Gulf of Mexico and the Everglades.
By airboat and van
Fossil Expeditions of Fort Myers (% 800-304-9432 or 941-368-3252; www.
fossilexpeditions.com) offers six-hour, hands-on, fossil-collecting
tours in the Everglades that include an airboat ride. Tours run $60 for

stops at area shops, restaurants, and hotels. You can get on and off at
stops at your leisure. It costs $17 for adults, and $7 for kids 3 to 12 for
all-day passes.

Shopping
Shoppers will find the same theme in this region as in the rest of Florida:
We have few unique products other than seashells, T-shirts, and other
cheap trinkets.
A two-block stretch of 3rd Street South, at Broad Avenue, aspires to be
the Rodeo Drive of Naples but with the conspicuous absence of Gucci,
Prada, and Tiffany and Co. remains just an ordinary, albeit lovely, pricey
place for window-shopping. This glitzy collection of jewelers, clothiers, and
art galleries may be too rich for many wallets, but the window-shopping
here is unmatched. 
Nearby, the 5th Avenue South shopping area, between 3rd and 9th streets
south, has seen a renaissance in recent years and is now Naples’s hottest
wining and dining spot, complete with requisite Starbucks, though the
avenue is longer and a bit less chic than 3rd Street South, with stockbro-
kerages and real-estate offices thrown into the mix of boutiques and
antiques dealers. In Olde Naples (see the “The Top Attractions” following
“Exploring Fort Myers, Sanibel, Naples, and Marco Island,” earlier in this
chapter). The Old Marine Marketplace at Tin City, 1200 Fifth Ave. S. 
(% 239-262-4200), an oyster-processing plant in a past life, now houses
40 or so shops, plus restaurants, boat charters, and tours.
Finding the second-best shopping spots
North of Naples, the Miromar Outlets Mall (% 941-948-3766; www.
miromar.com) has Big Dog Sportswear, Off Fifth, Polo, Cole Haan, Dansk,
and dozens more. To get there, take I-75 north from Naples or south from
Fort Myers to Exit 19 (Corkscrew Road) and follow the signs. Remember
my standard outlet warning: Know what the retail price is so you can tell
if you’re really getting a bargain. 
In the south, Coastland Center Mall, U.S. 41 between Golden Gate
Parkway and Fleischmann (% 941-262-2323), is anchored by Sears,
JCPenney, Macy’s, and Dillard’s. The Village at Venetian Bay, 4200 Gulf
Shore Blvd. N., Naples (% 941-261-6100), features 50 canal-side shops,
including clothiers and art galleries.

Okay, you may be dying to put a shell next to your ear and pretend to
hear the ocean. Here’s your shot. The Shell Factory, 2787 N. Tamiami
Trail/U.S. 41, North Fort Myers (% 800-474-3557 or 941-995-2141), is
tacky, touristy, free, and crammed with 5 million shells, sponges, pieces
of coral, and fossils.
Living it up after dark
Keep in mind that in these parts, the most vibrant nightlife will probably
be found in your dreams. But for sunset cocktails that last until, say, mid-
night at the latest, you’ll find plenty of places. In addition to the listings in
this section, get entertainment updates from the local newspapers: The

night; so do clubs sprinkled around Olde Naples.
Bars
Named for the legendary flare sometimes caused by the setting sun, the
Green Flash Restaurant, Sanibel-Captiva Road, Captiva Island (% 941-
472-3337), has a ten-seat bar. (But because the restaurant faces east,
you’ll have to sip your beer out back to watch the sunset.) The Beached
Whale, 1249 Estero Blvd., Fort Myers Beach (% 941-463-5505), has
bands four or five nights a week. Stan’s Idle Hour Seafood Restaurant,
221 West Goodland Dr., Goodland (% 941-394-3041), is famous — well,
within local circles — for its sideshows. There’s a little song (Stan and
others are not quite ready for prime time), a little dance (the Buzzard
Lope Queens, a mondo bizarro feathery fiasco), and a little seltzer in
your pants (the Goodland Mullet Festival, always held the weekend before
the Super Bowl in conjunction with crowning a Buzzard Lope Queen).

Part V
Visiting Central Florida:
Mickey Mania

In this part . . .
I
f you know only one thing about Florida’s geography, it’s
probably that Orlando and Walt Disney World are smack-
dab in the middle of the bull’s-eye.
These locations are worlds unto themselves, especially
Mickeyville, which includes 47 square miles of real estate.
When you add Universal Orlando, SeaWorld, and several
wannabes to the mix, there are more options than there are
turrets on Cinderella Castle.
Fear not: In this part I help you divide and conquer this area.
In the ﬁrst chapter I tell you how to get you here, help you
ﬁnd a bed, and suggest a few dining options. I devote the
second chapter to Orlando’s major shrines — the theme
parks. Finally, in the third chapter I tell you all about the
city’s smaller attractions, shopping, and nightlife.

Chapter 17
Settling into Walt Disney
World and Orlando
In This Chapter

W
elcome to Orlando, a land ruled by a king-size mouse who turned
it into a modern utopia to many of the young and young at heart.
To the tens of millions who make the pilgrimage here — a group that
includes Super Bowl champs, princes, eccentric pop stars and regular
folks — it’s a national shrine. And it’s a crowded shrine at that.
Walt Disney’s Florida legacy is still growing almost 40 years after his
death and even includes two mega cruise ships. At current count,
Orlando has eight major theme parks (see Chapter 18), 80 or so smaller
attractions nearby (see Chapter 19), some 111,000 hotel and motel
rooms, and an avalanche of restaurants.
In this chapter, I get you into town, tell you how to get around, outline
the best places for you to lay your head at the end of the day, and give
you options for dining out. Making choices in this town doesn’t require a
doctorate in dodging dilemmas, but deciding a few things before the
landing gear lowers allows you to spend more time cozying up to the
Magic Mickey and the wannabes.
Getting There
A majority of travelers have limited vacation time — that’s why most
people fly to Orlando. Because you may have a little more leisure time, I
also give information about driving and taking the train.

By plane
Using the aerial route, you’ll most likely fly into Orlando International
Airport (% 407-825-2001; www.orlandoairports.net). Located just 25
minutes from Walt Disney World, Orlando International has direct or non-
stop service from 70 American and 25 international cities. Forty scheduled
airlines, and as many charters, feed 30 million people or more into these
terminals annually. The most frequently used carriers include Delta,
American, America West, British Airways, Air Canada, Continental, Jet
Blue, Midway, Northwest, Southwest, and US Airways. (See the “Quick
Concierge” in the back of the book for the telephone numbers and Web
sites of the major air carriers.)
The way to baggage claim is clearly marked. (You land at Level 3, take a
shuttle to the terminal, and then go to Level 2.)
If you need cash, ATMs are located in the arrival and departure termi-
nals near each pod of gates (1 to 29, 30 to 59, and so on). ATMs are also
located where the shuttles deposit you in the main terminal. If you need
to convert your pounds, euros, and so on to U.S. dollars, you can find
currency exchanges (open 10 a.m.–9 p.m.) opposite the ATMs at gate
pods 1 to 29 and 60 to 99 in the air terminal. In the main terminal, they’re
located where shuttles arrive from gates 1 to 29.
All major car-rental companies are located at the airport (on Level 1) 
or nearby. Check out the “Quick Concierge” in the back of this book for
the toll-free numbers of the major rental companies. You can find other
car-rental companies online at the airport’s Web site (www.orlando
airports.net).
At Orlando International Airport, arriving passengers can find informa-
tion at The Magic of Disney and Disney’s Flight of Fantastic, two shops
located in the A and B terminals, respectively. They sell Disney multiday
park tickets, make dinner-show and hotel reservations, and provide
brochures. They’re open 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily. The Universal Orlando
and SeaWorld stores in the airport offer similar services and hours.
The airport is a 25-minute hop, skip, and long jump from Disney World
and 20 minutes from Universal Orlando. 
If you’re traveling with at least one other person or you simply want to
avoid the hassle of a crowded shuttle bus, taxis are a good choice for
getting to your hotel. The rates for Ace Metro (% 407-855-0564) and
Yellow Cab (% 407-699-9999) are $2 for the first mile and $1.75 a mile
thereafter. The one-way charge from the airport to Disney for up to five
people in a cab or seven in a van is about $50. A trip to International
Drive is $30; to downtown, it’s $25. Vans and taxis load on the ground
level of the airport.
Mears Transportation (% 407-423-5566; www.mearstransportation.
com) provides shuttle service to and from area hotels and the airport
Part V: Visiting Central Florida: Mickey Mania 
290

with vans running 24 hours a day and departing every 15 to 25 minutes.
Round-trip fares are $25 to $29 adults and $18 to $21 children ages 4 to
11 (actual price depends on the location you’re going to); children 3 and
under ride free.
QuickTransportation/Orlando (% 888-784-2522 or 407-354-2456; www.
quicktransportation.com) offers shuttle or limo service that is a bit
more personal. Employees greet you at the airport’s baggage claim (with
a sign bearing your name). This company is more expensive than Mears
unless you have a big group (upwards of $130 roundtrip for up to seven
people), but it comes for you, not a full load of tourists, and it only goes
to your resort. This is a reasonable option for groups of five or more.
Some hotels offer free shuttle service to and from the airport, so make
sure to ask when booking your room.
By car
Driving to Orlando is a less expensive and potentially more scenic
option, unless the distance is so great that making the road trip eats up
too much of your vacation.
Here’s how far several cities are from Orlando: Atlanta, 436 miles;
Boston, 1,312 miles; Chicago, 1,120 miles; Cleveland, 1,009 miles; Dallas,
1,170 miles; Detroit, 1,114 miles; New York, 1,088 miles; and Toronto,
1,282 miles.
Folks coming from the West and Midwest usually connect with I-10 in
north Florida, go east, and follow I-75 south to the Florida Turnpike.
From inland eastern cities, take I-75 into Florida. For the coastal route,
take I-95 to Daytona Beach and then I-4 west to Orlando.
By train
Amtrak trains (% 800-872-7245; www.amtrak.com) pull into two central
stations: 1400 Sligh Blvd., between Columbia and Miller streets in down-
town Orlando, and 111 Dakin Ave., at Thurman Street in Kissimmee.
Amtrak’s Auto Train allows you to bring your car to Florida without
having to drive it all the way. The service begins in Lorton, Virginia —
about a four-hour drive from New York, two hours from Philadelphia —
and ends at Sanford, Florida, about 23 miles northeast of Orlando. The
Auto Train departs Lorton and Sanford daily at 4 p.m., arriving at the
other end of the line the next day at about 8:30 a.m. Fares for the Auto
Train vary according to season and schedule, but fares for two passen-
gers and a car begin at $398.
Amtrak offers money-saving packages to Orlando, including accommo-
dations (some at Walt Disney World resorts), car rentals, tours, and so
on. For package information, call % 800-321-8684.
Chapter 17: Settling into Walt Disney World and Orlando 291

Orienting Yourself in Orlando
Orlando’s major artery is Interstate 4, which runs diagonally across the
state from Tampa to Daytona Beach. Locals call it I-4 or that #@$*%^#!!
#$^#$% because it crawls at a snail’s pace, especially during the daily
rush hours (7–9 a.m. and 4–6 p.m.). Exits from I-4 — they’re mostly well
marked — lead to all Walt Disney World properties, Universal Orlando,
SeaWorld, International Drive, U.S. 192, Kissimmee, Lake Buena Vista,
downtown Orlando, and Winter Park. (Skip ahead to the “Orlando
Neighborhoods” map.)
The Florida Turnpike crosses I-4 and links with I-75 to the north. U.S. 192,
a major east–west artery, reaches from Kissimmee to U.S. 27, crossing 
I-4 near the southern Walt Disney World entrance road. Farther north,
the BeeLine Expressway toll road (or Florida 528) goes east from I-4, past
Orlando International Airport to Cape Canaveral and the Kennedy Space
Center. The East-West Expressway (also known as Florida 408) is a down-
town toll road that bypasses the tourist meccas.
Introducing the neighborhoods
We’ve broken Orlando into seven geographical areas:
 Walt Disney World: The area is big, and its tourist parks, resorts,
restaurants, shops, and trimmings are scattered across 30,500 acres.
Oh, and Disney isn’t in Orlando — it’s southwest of the city, off I-4
on west U.S. 192. Stay here and discover that convenience has its
price — room rates can be double those in nearby Kissimmee.
A major section of Walt Disney World, Downtown Disney is the name
that Disney gives to its two nighttime entertainment areas, Pleasure
Island and West Side, plus its shopping complex, Downtown Disney
Marketplace. The area is filled with restaurants, shops, and dance
clubs of all types and prices. Downtown Disney is actually in Lake
Buena Vista, although it’s a part of Walt Disney World.
 Lake Buena Vista: This Disney next-door neighbor is where you
can find official (Disney-approved but not Disney-owned) hotels.
It’s close to Downtown Disney and Pleasure Island. This charming
area has manicured lawns, tree-lined thoroughfares, and free trans-
portation throughout the realm. The major north–south road is
Highway 535, or Apopka-Vineland Road, which becomes Highway
435 north of Palm Parkway.
 Celebration: Imagine if Disney World were responsible for the
remake of The Stepford Wives. Scary, isn’t it? Celebration is an
attempt to re-create a Mickey-magic town. It has thousands of resi-
dents living in Disney homes, which start at about $220,000.
Celebration’s downtown area is, however, designed for tourists and
there is a proposal to add 1,000 more hotel rooms on the south side
of this community. The town square has some first-rate, if pricey,
shops and restaurants. Celebration is located off U.S. 192.

Orlando Neighborhoods

 Kissimmee: This area has a tacky side, loaded with T-shirt shops and
every burger barn known to Western civilization. But Kissimmee is
just 10 to 15 miles from the Wizard of Disney (beware of perpetual
road construction), and, with plenty of modest motels, it’s a good
choice for those on a budget. The town centers on U.S. 192/Irlo
Bronson Memorial Highway.
 International Drive (Highway 536): Oozing with T-shirt and sou-
venir shops, not to mention chain motels and fast-food joints, 
I-Drive is a euphemism for “tourist trap.” This neon-lit, always open
area extends 7 to 10 miles north of the Disney kingdom, between
Highway 535 and the Florida Turnpike. The north end is truly tacky.
From bungee jumping to dozens of themed restaurants, this stretch
of road is the tourist strip in Central Florida. I-Drive also offers
some upscale hotels and shopping areas in its central and southern
regions. It’s the home of the Orange County Convention Center and
offers easy access to SeaWorld and Universal Studios. The road
runs north–south.
 Downtown Orlando: Right off I-4 East, Downtown Orlando, located
12 miles north of Disney, is the home of hotels, restaurants, bars,
and cultural offerings patronized by locals but only a sprinkling of
tourists. Dozens of shops line Antique Row on Orange Avenue near
Lake Ivanhoe.
 Winter Park: Just north of downtown Orlando, Winter Park offers
Park Avenue, a collection of upscale shops and restaurants, along
a cobblestone street. Winter Park has little if any kid-appeal, and
it’s too far north (about 20 miles) to use as a home base, if you plan
on spending much time at the Disney parks.
Finding information after you arrive
After you’ve landed, one of the best places for up-to-date information is
the concierge or the front desk at your hotel (and they’re even better if
you’re staying at a Disney property).
If you’re in the International Drive area, stop at the official Orlando/
Orange County Convention & Visitors Bureau (% 407-363-5872; www.
Orlandoinfo.com), 8723 International Dr. (four blocks south of Sand Lake
Road), for information. Friday’s “Calendar” section in the Orlando Sentinel
(www.orlandosentinel.com) also includes a lot of tourist-friendly infor-
mation on dining and entertainment. See “Fast Facts” at the end of
Chapter 19 for additional information sources.
Getting Around Orlando
Tens of millions of people visit Orlando’s theme parks yearly, and the
city’s tourism czars want to make going from Point A to Point B as easy
as 1-2-3. That’s because the faster you can get around, the more time
(and money) you can spend in the parks, attractions, and restaurants.
Part V: Visiting Central Florida: Mickey Mania 
294

Still, unless you spend your entire vacation inside Walt Disney World or
Universal, you’re going to have to deal with slow-downs, such as rush
hour (7–9 a.m. and 4–6 p.m. daily) and peak-period crowds (weekends
and summers are the worst).
One way you shouldn’t travel around Orlando is on foot. This city isn’t
conducive to strolling. Within the safe confines of the theme parks,
you’ll have no problems getting around (in fact, most folks are on their
feet quite a bit), but walking anywhere outside the theme parks is a
thrills-and-chills experience that most people want to avoid. Wide roads
that are designed to move traffic quickly and a shortage of sidewalks,
streetlights, and crosswalks are to blame.
Here are some of the more conventional ways of getting around.
By the Disney transportation system
If you’re going to stay at a Walt Disney World resort or official hotel (see
“Staying in Style,” later in this chapter) and spend the majority of your
time in Disney parks, then you can skip a rental car. A free transporta-
tion network runs throughout Disney World. Buses, ferries, water taxis,
and monorails operate from two hours prior to the Disney parks’ open-
ing until two hours after closing. There’s also service to various Disney
shopping areas, nightclubs, and smaller attractions.
In addition to being free, the system saves you the cost of a rental car,
gas, and/or the $8 daily parking charge at the attractions. But you’re at
the mercy of Disney’s schedule. Sometimes you have to take a ferry to
catch a bus to get on the monorail to reach your hotel. Reaching a place
that’s right across the lagoon from you can take an hour or more.
By trolley
The I-Ride Trolley on International Drive (% 866-243-7883; www.iride
trolley.com) runs every 15 minutes, 8 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. (75¢ for adults,
25¢ for seniors, kids under 12 ride free). Due to I-Drive’s bumper-to-
bumper traffic, this is the best way to get around if you’re staying in this
area or at least spending the day.
By car
If you’re flying here on an extended stay — more than a week — you
probably want to rent a car for at least a day or two to venture beyond
the tourist areas. (Yes, there is life beyond the theme parks.) See the
“Quick Concierge” at the back of this book for toll-free numbers of vari-
ous car-rental agencies. For navigational tips, check out “Orienting
Yourself in Orlando,” earlier in this chapter.
By bus
Lynx (% 407-841-2279; www.golynx.com) bus stops are marked with a
paw print. The buses serve Disney, Universal, and International Drive
Chapter 17: Settling into Walt Disney World and Orlando 295

as well as the downtown ($1.25 for adults, 50¢ for kids 8–18), but their
routes are not always visitor-oriented.
By taxi
Yellow Cab (% 407-699-9999) and Ace Metro (% 407-855-0564) are
among the taxi companies serving the Orlando area. But for day-to-day
travel to and from the attractions, cabs are expensive, unless your group
has five or more people. Rates are $2 for the first mile, and $1.75 per
mile thereafter.
By shuttle
Mears Transportation Group (% 407-423-5566) operates shuttle buses
to all major attractions, including Cypress Gardens, Kennedy Space
Center, Universal Orlando, and SeaWorld, among others. Rates vary by
destination.
Staying in Style
Unlike the less competitive areas of Florida, almost every hotel in
Orlando (at least each listed here) has been built or renovated in the
past 20 years, so you can expect reasonably modern trimmings. (You
don’t need rabbit ears to see what’s on the tube.) Most places in
Orlando also try to make kids feel like Mickey’s personal guests.
However, deciding where to stay isn’t all that easy because Orlando’s
more than 111,000 rooms come in many different flavors: hotels, motels,
bed-and-breakfasts, and so on.
The best bet is to first determine which attractions you want to visit
during your stay, and then book a hotel close to those areas. For exam-
ple, if you’re visiting Walt Disney World, stay in a Disney resort, if you
don’t mind paying a little extra; on Highway 535/Apopka-Vineland Road,
if you want to save a few bucks; or U.S. 192, if you want to save even
more. 
Beyond the obvious proximity to the parks, there are other benefits to
staying in an official WDW hotel. Perks often include extended hours in
parks for hotel guests, special discount passes to parks and, of course,
the ability to dine with Mickey and Minnie at character-themed meals
within the hotel restaurants. 
Although not Disney-owned, official Disney hotels in Lake Buena Vista
offer some of the privileges Disney resort guests enjoy, often for less
money than the better Disney resorts. If you’re planning your trip
around Universal Orlando, consider one of its hotels or, as is the case
with SeaWorld fans, one of those along International Drive. To orient
yourself, see the “Accommodations and Dining in Walt Disney World and
Lake Buena Vista” map, later in this chapter.
Part V: Visiting Central Florida: Mickey Mania 
296

Many accommodations let kids under 12 (and in many cases under 18)
stay free with parents or guardians, as long as you don’t exceed the
room’s capacity. But to be sure, ask when booking your room.
All the accommodations listed here offer free parking, air-conditioning,
and pools, unless otherwise noted.
Don’t forget to allow for taxes. The combined sales, local-option, and
hotel taxes will increase your bill by 11 percent to 12 percent, depending
on where you choose to stay.
If you’re considering booking a room at a Disney resort, be sure to ask,
when calling the Central Reservations Office (% 407-934-7639); www.
disneyworld.com), about any discounts available to members of AAA 
or other auto clubs, AARP, frequent-flier programs, or other groups. 
Also, ask about meal plans that could save you money or packages 
that include your room, tickets, and airfare.
If you don’t like dealing with hotels or haggling over rates, the Florida
Hotel Network (% 800-538-3616; www.floridahotels.com) will make
your reservations for you.
The top hotels
Best Western Lake Buena Vista
$$
Lake Buena Vista/Official WDW Hotel
This 18-story high-rise is a great place to view the Disney fireworks ($15
more per night for a room with a view) without braving the crowds in the
parks. The 325-unit lakefront hotel is located on prime property along
Hotel Plaza Boulevard and is within walking distance of Downtown Disney
Marketplace. The rooms are large, and some come with balconies and
views of the lake. Amenities include Nintendo, coffeemakers, free local
calls, an on-site restaurant, several pools, a playground, baby-sitting serv-
ice, and free shuttles to Disney parks.
See map p. 300. 2000 Hotel Plaza Blvd. % 800-348-3765 or 407-828-2424. Fax:: 407-
828-8933. www.orlandoresorthotel.com. To get there: Located between Buena
Vista Drive and Apopka-Vineland Road/Highway 535, across from Doubletree Hotel.
Free parking. Rack rates: $99–$159; $199–$399 suite. AE, DC, DISC, JCB, MC, V.
Celebration Hotel
$$–$$$
Celebration
Located in the Disney-created town of Celebration, this hotel has a three-
story, wood-frame design straight out of 1920s Florida. All rooms have TVs
with Nintendo, speaker phones with voice mail and dataports, ceiling fans,
safes, hair dryers, and makeup mirrors. Suites and studios have refrigera-
tors and wet bars. Other amenities include a Jacuzzi and fitness center.
You can walk to shops and restaurants. An 18-hole golf course is nearby.

to the second light, then right on Celebration Avenue. Parking: $10 valet, free self-
parking. Rack rates: $139–$219; $289–$470 suite. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V.
Disney’s All-Star Movies Resort
$–$$
Walt Disney World
Kids aren’t the only ones amazed by the, uh, aesthetics of this resort. When
did you last see architecture as inspiring as Goliath-size Dalmatians leaping
from balconies? And the low (by Mickey standards) rates will thrill some
parents. The All-Star resort in the “Runner-up accommodations” listings,
later in this chapter, is pretty much the same — expect small rooms and
postage-stamp-size bathrooms. But you’re still “on property,” and you’re
enjoying the lowest prices your Mouse bucks can buy. There’s a food court
that serves pizza, pasta, sandwiches, and family-dinner platters.
Note: Disney has two additional All-Star resorts — the All-Star Sports-
Resort and the All-Star Music resort — both identical to the Disney’s All-
Movies Resort where it counts (like room size and layout). The only major
difference is the change in theme: One offers musical themes ranging from
jazz to Calypso, and the other features movies (of the Disney variety of
course). All three of the All Star resorts are located out in the Disney
boonies, and the closest park is Animal Kingdom. 
See map p. 300. 1991 W. Buena Vista Dr. % 407-934-7639 or 407-939-7000. Fax: 407-
939-7111. www.disneyworld.com. To get there: Located close to Animal Kingdom,
Blizzard Beach, and Winter Summerland. Free parking. Rack rates: $77–$126. AE, DC,
DISC, JCB, MC, V.
Disney’s BoardWalk Inn & Villas
$$$$
Walt Disney World
Overlooking a village green and lake, this 1920s “seaside” resort appeals to
couples and singles looking for a sliver of yesterday. The standard accom-
modations have two queen-size beds, a child-size daybed, a midsize bath-
room, dataports, hair dryers, and balconies. Recreational facilities include
tennis, fishing, boating, bike rental, and even a moonlight cruise. Hang onto
your swimsuit if you hit the pool’s famous — or infamous, depending on
how you look at it — 200-foot “keister coaster” water slide. The villas sleep
up to 12 and some have kitchens, washer-dryers, and whirlpool baths.
After the sun goes down, there’s plenty to do because the resort has a
quarter-mile boardwalk that offers shops, restaurants, and street per-
formers. There are two restaurants. Note: Rooms overlooking the
Boardwalk have the best views, but they tend to be noisier, thanks to the
action below.
See map p. 300. 2101 N. Epcot Resorts Blvd. % 407-934-7639 or 407-939-5100. Fax:
407-934-5150. www.disneyworld.com. To get there: Located north of Buena Vista
Drive, on Epcot Resorts Boulevard. Parking: Valet $7, free self-parking. Rack rates:
$289–$675; $289–$1,915 villa. AE, DC, DISC, JCB, MC, V.
Part V: Visiting Central Florida: Mickey Mania 
298

Disney’s Coronado Springs Resort
$$
Walt Disney World
This moderate-priced resort has an American Southwest theme and a
slightly more upscale feel than the others in this class. Rooms are housed
in four- and five-story hacienda-style buildings with palm-shaded court-
yards. Some overlook the 15-acre Golden Lake; the better your view, the
higher the price. Rooms feature two double beds (the decor differs in each
section, but the layout is the same) with coffeemakers, hair dryers, and dat-
aports. Ninety-nine rooms are specially designed to accommodate travelers
with disabilities, and nearly three-fourths of the rooms are nonsmoking.
See map p. 300. 1000 Buena Vista Dr. % 407-934-7639 or 407-939-1000. Fax: 407-939-
1003. www.disneyworld.com. To get there: It’s near Disney’s Blizzard Beach off
Buena Vista Drive. Free parking. Rack rates: $133–$209; $278–$1,050 suite. AE, DC,
DISC, JCB, MC, V.
Disney’s Fort Wilderness Resort and Campground
$–$$$
Walt Disney World
This woodsy, 780-acre resort is a camper’s dream come true, but it’s quite
a hike from most of the Disney parks except the Magic Kingdom. Even so,
there’s more than enough to keep you busy here. Guests enjoy extensive
recreational facilities, ranging from a riding stable to a nightly campfire.
The 784 secluded campsites for RVs and tents offer 110/220-volt outlets,
barbecue grills, picnic tables, and kids’ play areas. There are also 408
wilderness cabins (actually, they’re trailers) that can sleep up to six
people; they also have living rooms, fully equipped eat-in kitchens, cof-
feemakers, hair dryers, and barbecue grills. Nearby Pioneer Hall hosts the
rambunctious Hoop-Dee-Doo Musical Revue (see listing under “Disney
character dining,” later in this chapter) nightly.
See map p. 300. 3520 N. Fort Wilderness Trail. % 407-934-7639 or 407-824-2900. Fax:
407-824-3508. www.disneyworld.com. To get there: Located off Vista Boulevard,
on Fort Wilderness Trail. Free parking. Rack rates: $35–$82 campsites; $229–$329
cabins. AE, DC, DISC, JCB, MC, V.
Disney’s Grand Floridian Resort & Spa
$$$$
Walt Disney World
You won’t find a more luxurious address than this 40-acre Great Gatsby–era
resort on the shores of the Seven Seas Lagoon. It’s a great choice for cou-
ples seeking a bit of romance, especially honeymooners who aren’t on a
tight budget. The Grand Floridian is Walt Disney World’s upper-crust flag-
ship, and it’s as pricey as it is plush. The opulent, five-story domed lobby
hosts afternoon teas accompanied by piano music. In the evenings, an
orchestra plays big-band tunes. Most rooms overlook a garden, pool,
courtyard, or the lagoon. The hotel is one of three on the Disney monorail
line. The resort also has a first-rate health club and spa, as well as five
restaurants, including the ultrapricey Victoria & Albert’s.

Just south of the Magic Kingdom, the 25-acre Polynesian is the third resort
on the monorail line. Its extensive play areas and themed swimming pools
make it a good choice for those traveling with kids. Public areas have
canvas cabanas, hammocks, and big swings overlooking a 200-acre lagoon.
Lush landscaping gives it a true island feel. Rooms are average size, and all
but a few can accommodate up to five people.

Disney’s Pop Century Resort
$–$$
Walt Disney World
More for the parents than for the kids, this resort pays homage to promi-
nent members of pop culture including the 8-track tape and the Rubik’s
Cube with larger-than-life replicas of them and other kitschy memorabilia.
Although the rooms and bathrooms here are smaller than the blow-up
Rubik’s Cube, it’s worth a stay here just for the kitsch factor alone, not to
mention the opportunity to explain to the kids how cool you once were.

Disney’s Saratoga Springs Resort and Spa
$$$$
Walt Disney World
The newest of the Disney vacation club resorts opened in May 2004 and
transports guests back in time to the heyday of upstate New York’s 19th-
century resorts. The small resort town of Saratoga Springs is evoked
through lavish gardens, Victorian architecture, bubbling springs, and a
country setting. The resort’s main pool brings to mind its namesake’s nat-
ural springs, with “healing” waters spilling over the rocky landscaping. The
renowned spa at the now-closed Disney Institute has been incorporated
into this resort. Accommodations resemble those of the other Disney
vacation properties and range from studios that sleep four to grand villas
that can sleep up to 12 people quite comfortably.

Disney’s Wilderness Lodge
$$–$$$$
Walt Disney World
The surrounding tall timbers, spouting geyser and hot springs, mammoth
stone hearth, and bunk beds for the kids give the Wilderness Lodge an old-
time national-park feel, making it a favorite of families and couples alike.
Standard rooms sleep four, and if a view is important to you, those with
woods views are the best. The restaurants located at this resort offer some
of the most spectacular views in the park. While the nearest park is Magic
Kingdom, the resort, in keeping with its theme, is in a fairly remote area.

Hard Rock Hotel
$$$
International Drive Area/Universal Orlando
You can’t get rooms closer to CityWalk, Islands of Adventure, or Universal
Studios Florida than those at this hotel. Rooms come with two queens or
one king, and feature safes, irons, and hair dryers. Unfortunately, although
the rooms are pretty soundproof, a few notes of music seep through the
walls, so ask for a room that’s away from the lobby. There’s free trans-
portation to the Universal and SeaWorld parks. As for Disney, you’re on
your own. The biggest perk: Guests get no-line access to almost all rides at
Universal’s theme parks.

Lake Buena Vista/Official WDW Hotel
Formerly known as The Courtyard by Marriott, this official WDW hotel is
a moderately priced landing pad on Hotel Plaza Boulevard, close to
Downtown Disney Marketplace’s shops and restaurants. Rooms have
coffeemakers and hair dryers; most have balconies. Rooms on the west
side, floors 8 to 14, have a view of the Magic Kingdom and Disney fire-
works. The hotel has a 14-story atrium, a full-service restaurant, and two
lounges. There’s free transportation to WDW parks, transportation for a
fee to others.

Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress
$$$–$$$$
Lake Buena Vista
A resort destination in and of itself, this is a great place to escape the Disney
crowd frenzy, but be just a mile away from the park itself. You need deep
pockets to stay here, but the reward is a palatial resort with a Thai theme.
The hotel’s 18-story atrium has inner and outer glass elevators, which pro-
vide a unique thrill. The beautifully decorated rooms offer minibars, safes,
irons, dataports, and hair dryers. Recreational facilities include 45 holes of
golf, 12 tennis courts (5 lighted), 2 racquetball courts, a spa, an adjoining
equestrian center, and more. The property’s half-acre, 800,000-gallon pool
has caves, grottoes, and waterfalls. There’s free transportation to WDW,
and hotel personnel can arrange shuttle service for a fee to go elsewhere.

Portofino Bay Hotel
$$$–$$$$
International Drive Area/Universal Orlando
Can you say swanky? This romantic, upscale resort is designed to look like
the village of Portofino, Italy, complete with a harbor and canals that lead
you via boat to the theme parks. The rooms sleep up to five and have beds
with Egyptian-woven sheets and pillows so soft you’ll want to take them
home. Ask for a view overlooking the piazza and “bay” area. The Portofino
doesn’t just have swimming pools; its beach pool has a fort with a water
slide, and the villa pool offers several cabanas with laptop hookups for the
perfect mix of business and pleasure. The resort’s Mandara Spa features a
state-of-the-art fitness center and full-service spa. The drawbacks: There
are stairs everywhere you turn, and the sheer size of the resort can make
it difficult to find your way around. There’s free transportation to Universal
and SeaWorld parks, but (they’re not stupid!) not the Disney ones. Guests
get no-line access to almost all rides at Universal’s theme parks.

Renaissance Orlando Resort at SeaWorld
$$–$$$
International Drive
Large rooms, good service, and luxurious surroundings are this hotel’s
calling cards. Its most valuable feature, however, is a location that’s per-
fect if you’re going to SeaWorld (it’s right across the street), Universal,
and to a lesser degree, the second-tier I-Drive attractions. The comfort-
able rooms offer marble baths, safes, dataports, and Sony PlayStations.

Mickey’s property without being bombarded by rodent decor. Both hotels
have larger-than-life statues (you can’t miss them) of swans and dolphins
on the roofs. The luxurious rooms are fairly large, with two queen-size
beds and first-class amenities; some of the units come with balconies. (The
Swan’s rooms are a bit smaller.) Guests are encouraged to dine at both
resorts, which share a Body by Jake health club.

equipped for travelers with limited mobility. Rates include free transporta-
tion to Disney; you pay a fee for transportation to the other theme parks.
The massive, European-style spa offers over 60 luxe treatments to relax tired

Dining Out 
Hungry yet? You can pick and choose from almost 4,000 restaurants in
Orlando. Because you may spend a lot of time in the Walt Disney World
area, I give special attention to dining choices there.
Unless otherwise noted, parking is free.
All sit-down restaurants inside the Disney parks require park admission,
with one exception: the Rainforest Café at Animal Kingdom. If you spend
all day in the parks, you may find eating inside at one of the WDW restau-
rants more convenient, but you’ll probably pay an average of 25 percent
more than you would in the outside world. Also, keep in mind that alco-
hol isn’t served in the Magic Kingdom. Note: All Florida restaurants and
food-serving bars are smoke-free.
The Disney restaurants don’t take typical reservations. Instead, all Walt
Disney World eateries have priority seating. Priority seating isn’t a reser-
vation. You will get priority over any others waiting for a table at the time
you schedule. There may still be a wait, but it will generally be shorter
than it would be if you didn’t have one. And if you don’t use priority seat-
ing, especially for the most popular restaurants such as Cinderella’s
Table, you may miss out all together as these popular restaurants are
usually booked well in advance, leaving little or no room at all for the
guests who decide to just show up for a table. To make a priority seating,
call % 407-939-3463. If you’re staying on Disney property, you can
arrange priority seating right at your resort. At Epcot, you can do it at the
WorldKey interactive terminals at Guest Relations near Innoventions
East, the WorldKey Information Service on the main concourse to the
World Showcase, as well as at the restaurant of your choice. 
Don’t forget to allow for the 6 to 7 percent sales tax when estimating
your dining budget.
Bergamo’s
$$–$$$
International Drive Area
NORTHERN ITALIAN
Bergamo’s is almost always packed, and the singing waiters here are nearly
as much fun as the food. For example, you may find Broadway show tunes
and opera mixed with roasted veal and steamed mussels, among other
treats. Even if you don’t eat, this is a good spot to enjoy the show over
cocktails.

Bubbaloo’s Bodacious BBQ
$
Near North
BARBECUE
Smoke billows from the chimney of this real-pit barbecue joint. The atmos-
phere is informal, but watch the sauces. Even the mild may be too hot for
tender palates; the killer sauce comes with a three-alarm warning — it’s
meant only for those with asbestos taste buds and a ceramic-lined tummy.
The pork platter with fixins is a deal and a half. It comes with beans and
slaw. Monday through Friday you’ll find daily specials that include chicken,
meat loaf, turkey, and open-face roast-beef sandwiches with gravy and veg-
etables. And, it wouldn’t be a barbecue without plenty of brew on hand.
See map p. 302. 1471 Lee Rd. % 407-295-1212. To get there: From I-4, take the Lee
Road exit; the restaurant is on left, next to a dry cleaner. Reservations not accepted.
Main courses: $4–$13. AE, MC, V. Open: Sun–Thurs 10 a.m.–9:30 p.m., Fri–Sat 
10 a.m.–10:30 p.m.
Café Tu Tu Tango
$
International Drive
TAPAS
This colorful eatery features treats from Latin America, Asia, the
Caribbean, the Middle East, and the United States. It’s an ideal spot for
sampling; every order comes in a miniature size. Try the Cajun-style egg
rolls filled with blackened chicken, pepper-crusted seared tuna sashimi
with rice noodles, or alligator bites in pepper sauce. The sangria here is
potent, so beware. While you eat or wait for your table, you may be enter-
tained by a belly dancer, a magician, or a couple doing a tango. Note:
Ordering several tapas (even those with small appetites will want two or
three) and drinks can turn this into a $$$ restaurant.

Food from around the world
Epcot’s World Showcase has some of the best dining options inside the WDW theme
parks, thanks to the cultural cuisine of its 11 nation pavilions. Although many consider
a meal here an essential part of the experience, I must point out that the food (as in all
the parks) is priced higher than comparable fare in the free world.
Chow on red meat in Canada, dine on Yorkshire pudding in the U.K., have more than
french fries in France, do a kebab in Morocco, teriyaki in Japan, pasta in Italy, and,
well, you get the picture.

Disney’s Contemporary Resort
NEW AMERICAN
The 15th-floor views of the Magic Kingdom and environs are stunning, and
the food is pretty good, too. You can sit by the show kitchens and talk to the
chefs as they work magic before your eyes. Not necessarily catering to kids,
the menu features choices ranging from seafood and sushi to steaks, with
highlights such as roasted striped bass and grilled pork tenderloin with bal-
samic-smothered mushrooms. In addition, the Grill sports a grand wine list
and has a nice sushi menu (Dungeness crab, eel, tuna, and more), ranging
from appetizers to large platters.

Christini’s Ristorante
$$–$$$$
International Drive
ITALIAN
Awards on the walls attest to Chris Christini’s standard of service. The fact
that he’s been around since 1984 shows he’s a survivor. Count on great
service and a possible peek at celebs like Michael Douglas, Michael Jordan,
and Tiger Woods, among others. A tender veal chop seasoned with sage
and served with applesauce is one of the headliners. Other acts include
pan-seared Chilean sea bass over shrimp-and-lobster risotto, or the shrimp
flamed with brandy and vodka, then simmered in a spicy sauce and served
with linguine. The wine list is definitely a winner. The dress code leans
toward jackets for men and dressy dresses for women.

Disney’s Grand Floridian Resort & Spa
NEW FRENCH
The chef of this bright and airy 190-seat restaurant makes a statement with
French, Alsatian, and Provençal cuisine with California and Florida touches.
(Whew!) Depending on when you visit, the menu may include basil-crusted
rack of lamb or grilled salmon with fennel ravioli and Swiss chard. The
dining room includes a show kitchen and views of the Seven Seas Lagoon
and Magic Kingdom fireworks. Add a three-course wine offering for $25.
See map p. 300. 4401 Floridian Way. % 407-939-3463 or 407-824-3000. Priority seat-
ing recommended. Main courses: $25–$45. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V. Open: Wed–Sun
5:30–10 p.m.
Delfino Riviera
$$–$$$
Universal Orlando
ITALIAN
The atmosphere is pretty romantic in this ristorante, located above a
piazza overlooking the rest of the Portofino Bay Hotel. It’s the resort’s sig-
nature eatery and includes strolling musicians and crooners. The chef’s
table has eight seats, and 20 more can dine on a balcony that offers a view
of the commoners sitting below. There’s also a terrace for outdoor dining.
Menu highlights include savory lobster-champagne risotto or black-olive
pasta with monkfish. Meat-eaters should consider veal roasted with
porcini mushrooms. Delfino’s wine list is second only to Emeril’s (see next
listing) among Universal Orlando’s restaurants.
See map p. 306. 5601 Universal Studios Blvd. % 407-503-3463. To get there: In the
Portofino Bay Hotel. Reservations recommended. Main courses: $30–$42. AE, MC, V.
Open: Tue–Sat 6–10 p.m.
Emeril’s
$$–$$$
Universal Orlando
NEW ORLEANS
Get a mouthful and eyeful in this ultramodern showplace operated by
Emeril Lagasse, star of Emeril Live on cable TV’s Food Network. This two-
story restaurant looks like an old warehouse, with a 12,000-bottle wine
gallery on the second floor. If you want a show, I highly recommend trying
to get one of the eight counter seats where you can watch the chefs work-
ing their Creole magic, but to get one you’ll need to make reservations
excruciatingly early — at least six weeks in advance.
Best bets include andouille-crusted redfish with pecan-and-vegetable
relish and quail served with vegetables and cornmeal-crusted oysters.
Jackets are recommended for gents at dinner, though you’ll find many
diners, fresh out of the Universal theme parks, far less dressy. Note: This
place isn’t geared toward kids.

CUBAN
Some see this family-run Cuban eatery as a hole in the wall, but you won’t
notice the decor after the paella hits your table. Selections also include
ropa vieja (literally “old clothes” because the beef is so tender), and arroz
con pollo (chicken and rice). The trimmings include Latin treats, such as
plantains.

Pacino’s Italian Ristorante
$$
South Orlando
ITALIAN
The ceiling of this restaurant contains fiber optics that create an aura of
dining under the stars, but there’s also a patio if you want the real thing.
Some servers can be a little aloof, but the price and taste make up for it.
Pacino’s serves veal chops that are usually fork tender, a challenging 32-
ounce porterhouse steak, and frutti di mare (shrimp, calamari, clams, and
scallops sautéed with white wine and herbs and heaped onto a mound of
linguine).
See map p. 300. 5795 W. Hwy. 192/Irlo Bronson Memorial Pkwy. % 407-396-8022. To
get there: 2 miles east of I-4. Reservations accepted. Main courses: $13–$26 (most
are under $20); pizza $9–$11. AE, MC, V. Open: Daily 4–10 p.m.
Pebbles
$$
Downtown Orlando
AMERICAN
This is as close as Orlando gets to a hometown chain. Classy and casual,
Pebbles features a menu that ranges from a create-your-own burger (price
negotiable) to filet mignon and honey-roasted spareribs. Owner Manny
Garcia offers affordability in the Pebbles line with entrees such as duck,
lamb, and pasta dishes as well as tapas (appetizers) and soups. Many
entrees come with three-cheese mashed potatoes and zucchini wedges.
The restaurant has a respectable wine list (order by the glass) and fun
atmosphere.
Pebbles has other locations, including at 2110 W. Hwy. 434 (% 407-774-
7111) and 12551 Hwy. 535 (% 407-827-1111).

NORWEGIAN
This eatery is a re-created 14th-century castle where you can sample a 40-
item smorgasbord of smavarmt (hot) and koldtbord (cold) dishes. The rea-
sonably good entrees usually include such dishes as venison stew, roast
pork, gravlax, smoked mackerel, and mustard herring.

Universal’s Royal Pacific Hotel
POLYNESIAN/ASIAN FUSION
Can you say BAM!? Pronounced “chop chop,” Emeril Lagasse’s second
restaurant in Orlando is named for the location of his original restaurant,
Tchoupitoulous Street in New Orleans. The exhibition kitchen offers a look
at chefs making Polynesian- and Asian-influenced entrees such as Kona
coffee–glazed duck breast with duck and vegetable chow mein, and grilled
rib-eye steak with garlic mashed potatoes, fried Maui onions, teriyaki
sauce, and stir-fried vegetables.

Wolfgang Puck Café
$$–$$$
Downtown Disney
AMERICAN/CALIFORNIA
My favorite stop is the copper-and-terrazo sushi bar, one of the best in
Orlando. You also can eat gourmet pizza, with thin crusts and exotic 
toppings, inside or on an outdoor patio. Upstairs, the main dining room
offers a seasonally changing menu that may feature grilled rack of lamb
with mushroom-infused mashed potatoes or a refreshing smoked duck
Napoleon with Boursin cheese, mango, and papaya between veggie won-
tons. The lower level can be noisy, so conversation may be difficult. Puck’s
also has a grab-and-go express restaurant that has sandwiches, pizzas,
desserts, and more.

Disney character dining
The 8-and-under crowd usually gets starry-eyed when Mickey, Pluto,
Cinderella, and friends show up to sign autographs and pose for photos.
Characters turn out at mealtimes at several Disney parks, attractions,
and resorts. These get-togethers are incredibly popular. Translation:
One-on-one interaction is somewhat brief.
Part V: Visiting Central Florida: Mickey Mania 
314

You may not find a seat if you show up to a character meal unannounced,
so make priority-seating reservations (these reservations don’t lock down
a table, but they do give you the next available table after you arrive) by
calling % 407-939-3463.
Prices vary, but generally expect breakfast (most serve it) to be $17 to
$20 for adults, $9 to $10 for kids 3 to 11; those that serve dinner charge
$21 to $24 for adults and $10 to $11 for kids.
Although I mention specific characters here, be advised that WDW fre-
quently changes its lineups, so don’t promise the kids a specific character
or you may get burned. Also, keep in mind that you’ll have to add the
price of admission to meals that are held inside the theme parks.
That said, here are a few of the choices.
Chef Mickey’s
Here, you can encounter your favorite cartoon characters twice a day: at
buffet breakfasts (eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, fruit, and other items)
and dinners (entrees change daily and are joined by a salad bar, soups,
vegetables, and ice cream with toppings). Mickey and various pals are
there to meet and mingle.
In Disney’s Contemporary Resort, 4600 North World Dr. Character breakfast: $16.99
adults, $8.99 children 3–11. Character dinner: $23.99 adults, $12.99 children 3–11.
Open: Daily 7–11:30 a.m. and 5–9:30 p.m.
Cinderella’s Royal Table
This castle — the focal point of the park — is the setting for daily charac-
ter breakfasts. The menu has standard fare: eggs, bacon, Danish, and fresh
breads. Hosts vary, but Cinderella always makes an appearance. This is
one of the most popular character meals in the park, so reserve far in
advance. This meal is a great way to start your day in the Magic Kingdom.
You must make priority-seating reservations backed by a credit card for
this breakfast; it will cost you $10 per adult and $5 per child if you cancel.
In Cinderella Castle, The Magic Kingdom. $15.99 adults, $8.99 children 3–11. Open:
Daily 8–10 a.m.
Liberty Tree Tavern
This colonial-style, 18th-century pub offers character dinners hosted by
Minnie, Goofy, Pluto, and Chip ’n’ Dale. Family-style meals include salad,
roast turkey, ham, cornbread, and dessert.
Food-wise, this is the best character meal in the World.
In Liberty Square, The Magic Kingdom. Dinner: $20.99 adults, $9.99 children 3–11.
Open: Daily 4 p.m. to park closing.

1900 Park Fare
The elegant Grand Floridian resort hosts character breakfasts (eggs,
French toast, bacon, and pancakes) and dinners (prime rib, pork loin, fish,
and more) in the festive, exposition-themed 1900 Park Fare. Big Bertha —
a 100-year-old French band organ that plays drums, cymbals, the xylo-
phone, and more — provides music. Mary Poppins, Alice in Wonderland,
and friends appear at breakfast; Pooh and friends star at dinner.
In Disney’s Grand Floridian Beach Resort, 4401 Floridian Way. Breakfast: $16.99
adults, $9.99 children 3–11. Dinner: $25.99 adults, $10.99 children 3–11. Open: Daily
7:30–11:30 a.m. and 5:15–9 p.m.
Dinner shows
Disney and Orlando have a reasonably busy dinner-show scene, but
their offerings aren’t like what you’ll find in New York or London. Here,
productions offer fun, not critically acclaimed drama, and focus on
entertaining the most important VIPs — kids. The shows serve meals
that are a cut above a TV dinner, but don’t come expecting a primo
dining experience. The admission prices listed below include dinner.
Arabian Nights
If you’re a horse fan, this show is a winner. It stars many of the most pop-
ular breeds, from chiseled Arabians to hard-driving quarter horses to beef-
cake Belgians. They giddy-up through performances that include Wild
West trick riding, chariot races, a little slapstick comedy, and bareback
daredevils. Locals rate it number one among Orlando dinner shows.
Usually, the performance opens with a ground trainer working one-on-one
with a black stallion. The dinner, served during the two-hour show,
includes salad, prime rib, or a vegetarian entree such as lasagna, plus veg-
etables, potatoes, and dessert.

recommended. Shows held daily, times vary. Admission: $39.59 adults, $20.33 
kids 3–11.
Dolly Parton’s Dixie Stampede and Dinner Show
Heee-haw, this is fun! And even if you or the kids aren’t fans of the buxom
country star, no worries, as she has little to do with this show besides
owning it. Horses, buffalo, and patriotic performers put on quite the show
while a feast of rotisserie chicken, hickory smoked barbecue pork loin, bis-
cuits, corn on the cob, potatoes, soup and all the Pepsi you can drink make
for a bombastic affair, to say the least.

adults, $19.99 kids 3–11.
Part V: Visiting Central Florida: Mickey Mania 
316

Hoop-Dee-Doo Musical Revue
This is Disney’s most popular show, so make reservations early. The
reward: You feast on an all-you-can-eat barbecue (fried chicken, smoked
ribs, salad, corn on the cob, baked beans, bread, strawberry shortcake,
and your choice of coffee, tea, beer, wine, sangria, or soda). While you stuff
yourself silly in Pioneer Hall, performers in 1890s garb lead you in a hand-
clapping, high-energy show that includes jokes you haven’t heard since
second grade.
If you catch one of the early shows, consider sticking around for the
Electrical Water Pageant at 9:45 p.m., viewed from the Fort Wilderness
Beach.
Be prepared to join in the fun, or the singers and the rest of the audience
will humiliate you.
3520 N. Fort Wilderness Trail. % 407-939-3563. www.disneyworld.com. To get
there: At WDW’s Fort Wilderness Resort and Campground. Reservations required.
Shows: 5 and 7:15 p.m.; sometimes a later show, too. Admission: Adults $49, kids 3–11
$25 including tax and gratuity.
Polynesian Luau Dinner Show
Although not quite as much in demand as the Hoop-Dee-Doo, the
Polynesian presents a delightful two-hour show that’s a favorite among
kids, all of whom are invited onto the stage. A colorfully costumed cast of
entertainers from Hawaii, New Zealand, Tahiti, and Samoa perform hula,
warrior, love, and fire dances on a flower-filled stage. It takes place five
nights a week in an open-air theater (dress for nighttime weather) with
candlelit tables, red-flame lanterns, and tapa-bark paintings on the walls.
Arrive early for the preshow highlighting Polynesian crafts and culture (lei
making, hula lessons, and more).
The all-you-can-eat meal includes island fruits, roasted chicken and pork
ribs, shrimp fried rice, vegetables, red and sweet potatoes, pull-apart cin-
namon bread, tropical ice-cream sundaes, coffee, tea, beer, wine, and soda.
1600 Seven Seas Dr. % 407-939-3463. www.disneyworld.com. To get there: At
Disney’s Polynesian Resort. Reservations required. Shows: Tues–Sat 5:15 and 8 p.m.

Touring the Theme Parks
In This Chapter
 Purchasing tickets and passes
 Enjoying the theme-park thrill rides
 Seeing all-star parades, fireworks, and shows
F
inally, we’re off to the parks — Disney’s Fab Four (Magic Kingdom,
Epcot, Disney–MGM Studios, and Animal Kingdom), Universal
Orlando’s Dynamic Duo (Universal Studios Florida and Islands of
Adventure) plus the marine scene at SeaWorld and Discovery Cove.
You know you won’t be alone. But do you know how much company
you’re going to have? In a typical year, these eight theme parks combined
attract more than 60 million visitors — 40 million of whom invade the
four Disney parks. And, all these folks are bent on riding the same rides
and eating at the same restaurants as you. You can have much more fun
at all the theme parks in Orlando if you arrive knowing which parks and
attractions suit your tastes and which you should avoid. So, you can dis-
cover how to rank them in this chapter.
Each of these parks takes at least a full day to see.
Walt Disney World: An Overview
Disney’s main theme parks line the western half of this 30,500-acre world.
(Skip ahead to the “Walt Disney World” map.) The Magic Kingdom is the
original attraction. With more than 15 million visitors in a normal year,
it’s busier than any other U.S. park. Epcot is the third busiest, welcoming
about 10 million visitors a year, followed by Disney–MGM Studios, at 8
million, and Animal Kingdom, with just under 8 million visitors a year.
Thrill-ride junkies end up finding many of the rides in the Disney parks
disappointing compared to Universal’s Islands of Adventure. However, 
9 of the 14 major rides at Islands have height restrictions, making it less
attractive to those traveling with smaller children.
All theme parks consider everyone 10 and older an adult, and the prices
I give you don’t include the 6 percent sales tax.

Pricing theme parks
At the time this book was published, Disney’s single-day, single-park
admission was $59.75 for adults and $48 kids 3 to 9. Multiday tickets
allow you to visit one park per day. A 7-day ticket costs $199 for adults,
$160 for kids. A Park Hopper add-on ($35 per ticket, per person) allows
visitors unlimited admission to Disney’s major parks for the length of
their ticket. A 1-day adult Park Hopper ticket costs $94.75, while the 7-day
version costs $234 — making the latter a far better deal. Premium Passes
are Park Hopper tickets that also allow visitors their choice of two to five
admissions to Typhoon Lagoon, Blizzard Beach, Pleasure Island, Disney-
Quest, or Disney’s Wide World of Sports. Prices range from an obscene
$139.95 for a 1-day adult pass to $268 for a 7-day pass (a very good deal).
Get more information on the parks and on prices for Disney’s tickets by
calling % 407-934-7639 or checking out www.disneyworld.com.
If you’re driving to the Disney parks, parking costs $8 per day. In the Size
XXXL Magic Kingdom lot, you probably want to ride the tram to the gate.
Trams are also available at Epcot, Disney–MGM Studios, and Animal
Kingdom, though many energetic guests hoof it to those gates.

Make a note of your parking area and row. After a day spent standing in
line, listening to screaming kids, and being tapped out by cash registers,
you may have a hard time remembering where you parked.
Enjoying Walt Disney World
Most of the parks open at 9 a.m. throughout the year. They remain open
at least until 6 p.m., and often as late as 11 p.m. or midnight during peak
periods. The exception is Animal Kingdom, which usually opens at 8 a.m.
and closes at 6 p.m. (slightly later during summer).
Ride and show lines at Disney can be incredibly long and irritating. A
20-minute wait is considered short, and 45 minutes to 1 hour or more
is common at primo rides. Consider getting a FASTPASS (see the
“FASTPASSing to the front of the line” sidebar later in this chapter)
ticket to shorten your line time.
Here are a few other ways to beat the lines:
 Come during off periods: mid-October through November (except
Thanksgiving week), the first two weeks of December, and mid-April
to late May. The worst times to visit are during holidays, spring
break, and school summer vacations.
 Arrive early and head straight for your number-one ride, preferably
one that’s away from the entrance. Most people stop at the first
ride they see.

FASTPASSing to the front of the line
Don’t want to stand in line as long as other guests? Disney parks have installed a ride-
reservation system called FASTPASS where you go to the primo rides, feed your
theme-park ticket stub into a small slot, and get an assigned time to return. When you
do, you get into a short line and climb aboard. FASTPASS is free. Here’s how it works:
Hang onto your ticket stub when you enter and go to the hottest ride on your dance
card. If it’s a FASTPASS attraction (they’re noted in the handout guide map), feed your
stub into the waist-level ticket taker. Retrieve your ticket stub and the FASTPASS stub
that comes with it. Look at the two times stamped on the latter. You can return during
that one-hour window and enter the ride with almost no wait. In the meantime, you
can do something else until the appointed time. Remember: Each person in your group
has to get his or her own FASTPASS ticket to get in the quickie line for a ride.
Note: Early in the day, your one-hour window may begin 40 minutes after you feed the
FASTPASS machine, but later in the day it may be hours. Initially, Disney only allowed
you to do this on one ride at a time. Now your FASTPASS ticket gives you a time you
can return to sign up for a second FASTPASS, even if you haven’t used your first reser-
vation yet.

 If you don’t like the parades held each afternoon in the various
parks, skip them and get on rides instead. Lines are shorter when
most visitors are lining the parade route.
 Pay attention to the signs at most attractions telling you how long
you have to wait.
 Ask or read the health and height restrictions for the rides before
you get in line, to avoid wasting time on one that isn’t for you.
 Get a show schedule as soon as you enter the park. You can find
them in the guide maps at the turnstiles and in park shops. The
rides are nonstop, but shows run at specific times.

parks, purchase a copy of Walt Disney World & Orlando For Dummies
(Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
The Magic Kingdom
Even newer additions to the park, such as Stitch’s Great Escape and
Splash Mountain, fall short of the 3-D and high-tech dynamics that you’ll
find at some other parks, but the kingdom is still the fairest of them all.
Main Street, U.S.A.
Though it’s considered one of the kingdom’s lands, Main Street is an
entry zone. Main Street Cinema is one of its few attractions (we call it
that in the loosest sense). You don’t have to pay admission to watch the
theater’s cartoons, including vintage ones like 1928’s Steamboat Willie.
But you do have to stand — there are no seats. You also can catch the
Walt Disney World Railroad here. This steam-powered train makes a 
15-minute loop around the park, with stops in Frontierland and Mickey’s
Toontown Fair.
We recommend passing through Main Street quickly when you arrive,
unless you hop the train. You have to return this way at the end of the
day, and if you’re inclined to visit the shops, you can do it then.
Tomorrowland
Thanks to Star Wars director George Lucas and others, today’s version of
the future is high-tech. Here are some of the headliners:
 Astro Orbiter: Astronaut wannabes, especially those who are 6
years old and under, love whirling high into the galaxy in colorful
rockets that circle a hub while rising and falling. Unfortunately, the
orbiter has ridiculously long lines, so skip it if you’re on a tight
timetable.
Chapter 18: Touring the Theme Parks 321

 Buzz Lightyear’s Space Ranger Spin: On this ride, you embark on
an interactive space adventure in which you help Buzz defend the
Earth’s supply of batteries from the evil Emperor Zurg. You fly an
XP-37 space cruiser armed with twin lasers and a joystick that’s
capable of spinning the craft. (Space Rangers who get motion sick-
ness should sit this attraction out.) While you cruise through space,
you collect points by blasting anything that smells remotely like
Zurg. Your hits trigger light, sound, and animation effects. Together,
you and Buzz save the galaxy.
 Space Mountain: Imagine a roller coaster. Then imagine it in the
dark. This ride, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad (later in this chap-
ter), and Splash Mountain (also later) are the four Magic Kingdom
attractions that teens and other thrill junkies bolt for first. So get
here early or save it for the off hours, such as lunch or parade time.
Space Mountain, a classic coaster, spins and plunges plenty
(though it seems faster, it never tops 28 mph). Grab a front seat for
the best ride. Note: Modern coaster crazies may find it a bit lame.
The ride has a 44-inch height minimum.
 Stitch’s Great Escape: Gone is the ultrascary ExtraTERRORestrial
Alien Encounter, and in its place is this ostensibly family-friendly
attraction based on the Disney hit film Lilo & Stitch. The story line
is a prequel to the movie, showing the mischief caused by rascally
Experiment 626 (aka Stitch) when he was originally captured. Unfor-
tunately, the ride is something of a disappointment both technically
and thematically — and some of its scarier effects mean it’s not all
that kid-friendly either. 
 The Timekeeper is hosted by a robot/mad scientist (Robin
Williams) and his assistant, 9-EYE, a flying, camera-headed droid
that moonlights as a time-machine test pilot. In this jet-speed
escapade, the audience hears Mozart as a young prodigy playing
for French royalty, watches da Vinci work, and floats in a hot-air
balloon over Red Square. It’s more for adults than kids.
 Tomorrowland Indie Speedway: Kids ages 4 to 9 like slipping into
these Indy-car knockoffs; but older children, teens, and adults find
the lines and the steering less than stellar — especially those who
are used to go-karts. The top speed is 7 mph, and a thick iron bar
separates your tires; so you’re pretty much kept on track. You have
to be a minimum of 52 inches tall to drive alone.
Mickey’s Toontown Fair
Head off cries of “Where’s Mickey?” by taking young kids (ages 2–8) to this
2-acre site as soon as you arrive. Toontown gives kids a chance to meet
Disney characters, including Mickey, Minnie, Donald Duck, Goofy, and
Pluto. The Magic Kingdom’s smallest land is set in a whimsical collection
of candy-striped tents. Here are some of Toontown’s highlights:
Part V: Visiting Central Florida: Mickey Mania 
322

 The Barnstormer at Goofy’s Wiseacre Farm is a mini roller coaster
designed to look and feel like a crop duster that flies slightly off
course and right through the Goofmeister’s barn. It has a 35-inch
height minimum, and its tight turns and small dips even give some
adults a rush.
 Donald’s Boat (The S.S. Miss Daisy) is an interactive play area with
fountains and water snakes that win squeals of joy (and relief on
hot days).
 Mickey’s & Minnie’s Country Houses provide a lot of visual fun
and some interactive areas for youngsters, though they’re usually
crowded and the lines flow like molasses. Mickey’s place features
garden and garage playgrounds. Minnie’s lets kids play in her
kitchen, where popcorn goes wild in a microwave and the utensils
strike up a symphony of their own.
 Toontown Hall of Fame offer continuous meetings with Disney
characters and a large assortment of Disney souvenirs.
Fantasyland
The rides and attractions in Fantasyland are based on the Disney
movies you grew up with way back when and some of the more recent
additions to the Disney treasure chest of films. Young kids want to spend
lots of time here, and the seemingly endless lines ensure that you will.
Here’s a list of attractions in Fantasyland:
 Cinderella Castle: Modeled on several French chateaux, the fairytale
Gothic-style castle sits at the end of Main Street in the center of the
park, and its hard to miss the 189-foot landmark and its 18 towers.
It’s a favorite photo op, and if you land at the right time, you can
meet Cinderella and other characters at the Forecourt Stage.
Otherwise, the castle is mainly a visual attraction. The interior corri-
dor has lovely murals and some exquisite mosaics depicting the
story of Cinderella. The castle is also home to Cinderella’s Royal
Table restaurant (see Chapter 17).
Though the exterior appears to be made of bricks, the castle’s
structure is actually composed of fiberglass and steel. But nobody
will be blowing this house down anytime soon — it’s designed to
withstand 90 mph winds.
 Cinderella’s Golden Carousel: This old beauty was built in 1917 by
the Philadelphia Toboggan Company and served tours in Detroit 
and New Jersey before it was discovered in the late 1960s by Disney
Imagineers and brought to the Magic Kingdom. A patriotic red,
white, and blue in its first incarnation, it was restored and re-themed
in time for the park’s opening and now tells the tale of Cinderella in
18 hand-painted scenes set above magnificent antique horses. It’s a
delight for kids and carousel lovers of all ages. The organ plays —
what else? — Disney classics such as “When You Wish Upon a Star”
and “Heigh Ho.”
Chapter 18: Touring the Theme Parks 323

 Dumbo the Flying Elephant: This attraction doesn’t do much for
adrenaline-addicted older kids — or line-hating parents — but it’s a
favorite of kids ages 2 through 6. Dumbo’s ears keep them airborne
for a gentle, circular flight with some little dips. Except for the
Disney theme, it’s not all that different from the kiddie rides at most
local carnivals. Most kids older than 6 are humiliated if you even
suggest they ride it. If your little ones are dying to ride Dumbo, get
here early — wait times are brutal, and it doesn’t have FASTPASS!
This ride is designed for the young ones, so plus-sized parents may
have trouble getting their elephant to fly, and the taller among you
may feel somewhat cramped.
 It’s a Small World: Young kids and most parents love this attrac-
tion; teens and most other adults find it a real gagger. Nevertheless,
pay your dues — it’s an initiation rite every Disney visitor needs to
undergo, and the line isn’t usually too long. You glide around the
world in small boats, meeting Russian dancers, Chinese acrobats,
and French cancan girls — and every one of them sings a tune that
eats its way into your brain and refuses to stop playing for months.
This attraction, one of the original few that opened with the park in
1971 (it was originally built by Walt Disney for the 1964 World’s
Fair), underwent a major renovation in 2004 that included painting
and repairing the animatronics figures, as well as replacing the
sound system and lights. 
 Mad Tea Party: You make this tea party wild or mild, depending on
how much you choose to spin the steering wheel of the teacup that
serves as your chariot. The ride is suitable for ages 4 and older.
Teens and older kids seem to enjoy this ride’s potential for turning
unwary passengers green. The woozy mouse who pops out of a big
teapot in the center of the platform would no doubt sympathize
with those left spinning.
 The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh: Pooh inadvertently
created a small storm of protest when Disney used this ride to
replace the popular Mr. Toad’s Wild Ride in 1999. The Many
Adventures of Winnie the Pooh features the cute-and-cuddly little
fellow along with Eeyore, Piglet, and Tigger. You board a golden
honey pot and ride through a storybook version of the Hundred
Acre Wood, keeping an eye out for Heffalumps, Woozles, blustery
days, and the Floody Place. This ride has become a favorite of kids
2 to 8 and their parents, so use a FASTPASS to avoid a long wait.
 Mickey’s PhilharMagic: This show stars Mickey, Donald, Ariel,
Aladdin, and others in an animated enhanced 3-D adventure pro-
jected on a 150-foot screen — the largest wraparound screen on the
planet. Like Jim Henson’s Muppet*Vision 3-D (later in this chapter),
the show combines music, animated film, puppetry, and special
effects that tickle several of your senses. Kids love the effects, and
if you’re a sucker for the classic Disney films, you will absolutely
adore it. 
Part V: Visiting Central Florida: Mickey Mania 
324

The show marks the first time the classic Disney characters have
ever been rendered in 3-D. In order to add nostalgic flavor, Donald’s
dialogue was created using a classic performance by Clarence
“Ducky” Nash, the character’s original voice. 
 Peter Pan’s Flight: Another popular ride among visitors younger
than 8, it begins with a nighttime flight over London (the only plus
for adults) in search of Captain Hook, Tiger Lily, and the Lost Boys.
It’s one of the old glide rides dating back to the limited technology
that was available when the Magic Kingdom was born. This ride
often has long lines, so I recommend a FASTPASS.
 Snow White’s Scary Adventure: Your journey takes you to the
dwarfs’ cottage and the wishing well, ending with the prince’s kiss
to break the evil spell. This version of the Grimms’ fairy tale is
much less grim than it was years ago, when the focus was inexpli-
cably on the wicked witch. Snow White now appears in several
friendly scenes, though kids younger than 4 still may get scared. I
can’t recommend it if your time schedule is tight; it’s very tame and
most find it a waste of time.
Liberty Square
Located between Fantasyland and Frontierland, Liberty Square is a 
re-creation of Revolutionary War–era America that infuses you with
Colonial spirit. Younger guests may not appreciate the historical touches
(such as the 13 lanterns symbolizing the original 13 colonies), but they’ll
delight in the chance to pose for a picture while locked in the stocks.
You may also encounter a fife-and-drum corps marching along the cob-
blestone streets. Here are some other features of Liberty Square:
 Liberty Belle Riverboat: A steam-powered sternwheeler called the
Liberty Belle departs Liberty Square for scenic cruises along the
Rivers of America. The passing landscape resembles the Wild West.
It makes a restful interlude for foot-weary park-stompers.
 Hall of Presidents: American-history buffs ages 10 and older most
appreciate this show, which can be a real squirmer for younger
children. The Hall is an inspiring production based on painstaking
research, right down to the clothes — each president’s costume
reflects his period’s fashion, fabrics, and tailoring techniques. The
show begins with a film on the importance of the Constitution pro-
jected on an immense 180-degree screen, and then the curtain rises
on America’s leaders, from George Washington through George W.
Bush. Pay special attention to the roll call of presidents. The anima-
tronic figures are incredibly lifelike: They fidget, whisper, and talk
to the audience. 
 Haunted Mansion: Although this attraction has changed little
through the years, and the Eddie Murphy flick bombed at the box
office, the mansion continues to be a favorite and has a cult follow-
ing. (My editor makes a pilgrimage here every time she hits the
Chapter 18: Touring the Theme Parks 325

park.) It has detailed special effects (this was one of the last rides
Walt Disney actually had a hand in designing) and an atmosphere
that’s more fun than creepy. You may chuckle at the corny tomb-
stones lining the entrance before you hop aboard your Doom Buggy
and are whisked past a ghostly banquet and ball, a graveyard band,
weird flying objects, and more. And don’t forget the 999 spirits of
the house, one of whom may try to hitch a ride home with you. 
The ride doesn’t get much scarier than spooky music, eerie howl-
ing, and things that go bump in the night. It’s best for those ages 
6 and older. FASTPASS is recommended as this attraction always
has a line.
Frontierland
Frontierland is located behind Adventureland and the rough-and-tumble
Old West architecture runs to log cabins and rustic saloons, while the
landscape is Southwestern scrubby with mesquite, cactus, yucca, and
prickly pear. Attractions in Frontierland include the following:
 Big Thunder Mountain Railroad: The lines don’t lie: This rocking
railroad is a favorite in the Magic Kingdom. Thunder Mountain
bounces you around an old mining site, where you dodge floods, a
bridge collapse, rock slides, and other mayhem. The ride is some-
thing of a low-grade roller coaster with speed and a lot of corkscrew
action. It has enough of a reputation that even first-time visitors
make a beeline for it. So if you can’t get to it as soon as the park
opens, FASTPASS is your best bet. Or give it a try late in the day or
when a parade pulls most visitors away from the rides.
Most Disney coaster veterans maintain the ride is at its best after
dark. The ride can be too intense for kids younger than 6 (and for
those with neck problems); riders must be at least 40 inches tall.
 Country Bear Jamboree: The stars of this 15-minute animatronic
show are bears that croon country-and-western tunes. The Jamboree
is a park standard — a show that’s been around since Disney
invented dirt — but it’s still a hit with Disney buffs and little kids.
The audience gets caught up in the hand-clapping, knee-slapping,
foot-stomping fun as Trixie laments lost love as she sings “Tears Will
Be the Chaser for Your Wine.” Teddi Beara descends from the ceiling
in a swing to perform “Heart, I Did All That I Could,” and Big Al
moans “Blood in the Saddle.”
Unless you have an affinity for all things Disney or have younger
children, this might be best saved for those really hot days when
you need a break inside. Most teens, young adults, and repeat visi-
tors won’t want to do it, even then.
Part V: Visiting Central Florida: Mickey Mania 
326

 Frontierland Shootin’ Arcade: Combining state-of-the-art electronics
with a traditional shooting-gallery format, this arcade offers 97 tar-
gets (slow-moving ore cars, buzzards, and gravediggers) in an 1850s
boomtown scenario. If you hit a tombstone, it may spin around and
mysteriously change its epitaph. Coyotes howl, bridges creak, and
skeletal arms reach out from the grave. To keep things authentic,
newfangled electronic firing mechanisms with infrared bullets are
concealed in genuine buffalo rifles. When you hit a target, you set off
sound and motion gags. Fifty cents fetches 25 shots.
 Splash Mountain: If I had to pick one ride as the Kingdom’s most
popular, Splash Mountain would be it. It’s on par with SeaWorld’s
Journey to Atlantis (later in this chapter), though half a click below
Jurassic Park River Adventure at Islands of Adventure (later in this
chapter). Still, Splash Mountain is a nifty voyage through the world of
Disney’s classic film Song of the South, past 26 colorful scenes that
include backwoods swamps, bayous, spooky caves, and waterfalls.
You ride in a hollow-log flume as Brer Fox and Brer Bear chase the
ever-wily Brer Rabbit and end your journey with a 52-foot, 45-degree,
40-mph finish, with a rather high splash factor (around 200 megatons
worth of wet). If you’re lucky enough to have some real heavy-
weights in the front seat, look for a little extra explosion on the five-
story downhill.
In summer, this ride can provide sweet relief from the heat and
humidity, but in cool weather, parents may want to protect their
kids (and themselves) from a chill. Splash Mountain is recom-
mended for ages 8 and older. Riders must be at least 40 inches tall.
On warmer days, the ride shoots out a spray of water onto the
viewing bridge in front of the big drop. If you want to catch your
friends unaware for a good soaking, count the log drops: Every
third one emits the spray.
 Tom Sawyer Island: Board Huck Finn’s raft for a two-minute float
across a river to this densely forested island, where kids can
explore Injun Joe’s Cave (complete with such scary sound effects as
whistling wind) and navigate a swinging bridge. Narrow, winding
dirt paths lined with oaks, pines, and sycamores create an authen-
tic backwoods atmosphere. It’s easy to get briefly lost and stumble
upon some unexpected adventure. It’s a good place for kids to lose
a little energy and for moms and dads to relax and maybe indulge
in lunch or a snack at Aunt Polly’s, which overlooks the river. 
Chapter 18: Touring the Theme Parks 327

Adventureland
Adventureland is a left turn off the end of Main Street. Kids can engage
in swashbuckling behavior while walking through dense tropical foliage
(complete with vines) or marauding through bamboo and thatch-roofed
huts. The architecture here is a combination of the Caribbean, Southeast
Asia, and Polynesia. Walt Disney wanted this section of the park to
exude romance, mystery, and (duh!) adventure. There’s plenty of the
latter here, especially for kids, though you may have trouble finding the
first two. Here are some of the most popular attractions in
Adventureland:
 Enchanted Tiki Room: Upgraded over the years, the show’s newest
cast member is Iago of Aladdin fame. This attraction is set in a
Polynesian-style building with thatched roof, bamboo beams, and
tapa-bark murals. Other players include 250 tropical birds, chanting
totem poles, and singing flowers that whistle, tweet, and warble.
The show runs continuously throughout the day. Young children
are most likely to appreciate this one but so will nostalgic adults.
Otherwise, consider this only as a respite from the heat.
 Jungle Cruise: You give Disney 10 minutes, they’ll give you four
famous rivers on three different continents. This narrated voyage 
on the Congo, Amazon, Mekong, and Nile rivers offers glimpses of
animatronic animals, tropical and subtropical foliage (most of it
real), a temple-of-doom-type camp, and lots of surprises. The ride
passes animatronic pygmies, pythons, elephants, rhinos, gorillas,
and hippos that pop threateningly out of the water and blow snot —
well, it could’ve been snot if they weren’t robots — on you. This
exhibit is about 30 years old, which means it’s pretty hokey some-
times, but it’s still a nice way to relax if the lines don’t stretch too
long (though the waiting area for this ride does offer some amusing
moments — check out the prop menus on the walls).
 Magic Carpets of Aladdin: The first major ride added in Adventure-
land since 1971 delights wee ones and some older kids. Its 16 four-
passenger carpets circle a giant genie’s bottle while camels spit
water at riders in much the same way riders are spritzed at One
Fish, Two Fish at Islands of Adventure (later in this chapter). The
fiberglass carpets spin and move up, down, forward, and back. 
If the lines are too long at Dumbo (see the “Fantasyland” section,
earlier in this chapter), this is a good alternative as the rides are
similar and the lines here aren’t as sluggish.
 Pirates of the Caribbean: This oldie but goodie is another cult
favorite (a Disney archivist confessed to me that it’s still his favorite
and this is another ride that Walt Disney had a hand in creating).
After walking through a long grotto, you board a boat headed into a
dark cave and are warned that “dead men tell no tales.” Therein,
elaborate scenery and hundreds of incredibly detailed (some of
Disney’s best) animatronic figures re-create an almost refreshingly
Part V: Visiting Central Florida: Mickey Mania 
328

non-P.C. Caribbean town overrun by buccaneers. To a background of
cheerful yo-ho-ho music, the sound of rushing waterfalls, squawking
seagulls, and screams of terror, passengers pass through the line of
fire into a raging raid and panorama of almost fierce-looking pirates
swigging rum, looting, and plundering. This ride is another great
place to cool off on a hot day.
Kids ages 5 and younger may find a pirate’s life a bit too scary,
especially with the small drop in the dark. Most kids 6 or older,
though, will enjoy it. The recent Oscar-nominated film based on the
ride (alas, there’s no Johnny Depp to be found here) has made it
even more popular with the young and teen set, who have fun spot-
ting the scenes appropriated by the movie. 
Offer a tip of your head to the parrot that sits above the ride’s
entrance plaza, and you may get a hearty greeting in response. 
 Swiss Family Treehouse: The story of the shipwrecked Swiss
Family Robinson (via the 1960 Disney film of the same name)
comes alive in this attraction made for swinging, exploring, and
crawling fun. The “tree,” designed by Disney Imagineers, has
330,000 polyethylene leaves sprouting from a 90-foot span of
branches; although it isn’t real, it’s draped with actual Spanish
moss. It’s simple and void of all that high-tech stuff that’s popular
in today’s parks. 
Be prepared to stand in a slow-moving line on busy days. The
attraction is also hard for travelers with limited mobility to navi-
gate. Though little kids like it, I couldn’t get either of my borrowed
offspring to give it a try — they wanted the big-ticket thrill rides.
Parades and fireworks
Disney excels at producing fanfare, and its parades and fireworks dis-
plays are among the best of their kind in the world. Note, however, that
some productions are staged only on a limited basis or during certain
times of the year. Grab a guide map when you arrive. It includes an
entertainment schedule that lists special goings-on for the day, including
concerts, encounters with characters, holiday events, and other major
happenings. If you want to know whether a specific parade or fireworks
show will be staged when you’re in town, consult the calendar at www.
disneyworld.com or call % 407-934-7639.
During fireworks and parades, Disney ropes off designated viewing spots
for travelers with disabilities and their parties. Consult your park map 
or a park employee at least an hour before the parade or you may have
trouble making it through the crowds to get to the designated spots.
Additionally, if there are two showings of a parade, the later one is usually
less crowded.
If nobody in your party is a huge parade fan, these are the best times to
ride some of the more popular attractions — while everyone else is lined
Chapter 18: Touring the Theme Parks 329

up along the parade route. You can also use the Walt Disney Railroad
(mentioned earlier in the chapter) to navigate around the various areas
of the park when the parade route has blocked off most major routes
through the park.
Here are Disney’s best parades and fireworks displays:
 Wishes: This explosive display debuted in fall 2003 and is touched
off nightly at closing except during the summer and on holidays
when extended park hours allow for the fireworks to be shown
between two scheduled showings of SpectroMagic (see next in this
list). Before the display, Tinker Bell flies magically from Cinderella
Castle. Then as a cacophony of intricately choreographed fireworks
fills the skies, and Jiminy Crickett narrates, images are projected
onto the castle in time to the medley of Disney songs being broad-
cast park-wide. Suggested viewing areas are Liberty Square,
Frontierland, and Mickey’s Toontown Fair. Disney hotels close to the
park (the Grand Floridian, Polynesian, Contemporary, and
Wilderness Lodge) also offer views, as the fireworks display is
rather large. This show can make even the most blasé fireworks
watcher say “wow!”
 SpectroMagic: This after-dark parade combines fiber optics, holo-
graphic images, clouds of liquid nitrogen, old-fashioned twinkling
lights, and a soundtrack featuring classic Disney tunes. Mickey,
dressed in an amber-and-purple grand magician’s cape, makes an
appearance in a confetti of light. You’ll also see the SpectroMen
atop the title float, and Chernabog, Fantasia’s monstrous demon,
who unfolds his 38-foot wingspan. It takes the electrical equivalent
of seven lightning bolts (enough to power a fleet of 2,000 trucks) to
bring the show to life. 
SpectroMagic plays only on limited nights, when park closing
extends past dusk (generally during busy periods and on week-
ends). When park hours are extended to 10 p.m. or later, there are
often two chances to view the parade. Check your show schedule
to determine availability.
 Share a Dream Come True Parade: This parade honors the 100th
anniversary of Uncle Walt’s birth (which has come and gone though
the parade lives on). Loads of characters (over 110 cast members
take part) march up Main Street and into Frontierland daily. The
parade was still going strong at press time, but it’s future status is
up in the air, so it may be gone by the time you arrive in Orlando.
Epcot
Grab a big pot. Stir in equal measures of theme park and museum, and
then add movies and cultural exhibits. What do you have? Epcot. Think
of Epcot as a trip around the world — without the jet lag, though some
say it’s just as draining if you try to experience it in one day.
Part V: Visiting Central Florida: Mickey Mania 
330

Walt Disney wanted this “Experimental Prototype Community of
Tomorrow” to be a high-tech city of 20,000 residents. But, when it was
built 15 years after his death, it was more theme park than community.
Epcot is divided into two sections. World Showcase lets you experience
exotic, far-flung lands without a passport, or you can sit in a sidewalk
cafe, munching some of the best pastries this side of Paris. In Future
World, you can ride deeper into the third millennium aboard thrill rides
or inside exhibits that use cutting-edge technology.
Of all the Disney parks, this one appeals least to younger children; it’s
better suited to the imaginations of older children and adults.
Future World
Most visitors enter Epcot through Future World, the northern section of
the park (although it appears on the bottom of your guide map).
Spaceship Earth, that thing that looks like a giant, silver golf ball, is at
the center of Future World. Exhibits focus on scientific achievements,
and technology, spanning areas from energy to undersea exploration.
Innoventions
The crescent-shaped buildings to your right and left, just beyond
Spaceship Earth, showcase cutting-edge technology and future prod-
ucts. The headliner in the building to the left (Innoventions East) as you
enter the park is House of Innoventions, which has a preview of tomor-
row’s smart house (including a refrigerator that can itemize and order
groceries, and a picture frame that can store and send photos to other
“smart frames”). There’s also an exhibit on Future Cars. Across the way
at Innoventions West, Sega is the major player, sponsoring dozens of
stations at Video Games of Tomorrow. Nearby, Medicine’s New Vision
goes behind the scenes with exhibits such as 3-D body imaging.
The fountains inside Innovention Plaza, the courtyard that separates
Innoventions East from West, perform water ballets to various Disney
and New Age (think John Tesh and Yanni) musical selections every 
15 minutes or so. At night, the streams of water are illuminated by more
than 1,000 colored lights. 
Imagination
Even the fountains in front of this pavilion are magical — shooting water
snakes through the air. (The fountains are popular with kids, who like to
try to catch the water snakes.)
The Journey into Imagination exhibit features Figment, a crazy-
but-lovable purple dragon. Things begin with an open house at the
Imagination Institute, with Dr. Nigel Channing (played by Monty
Python’s Eric Idle) taking you on a tour of the labs that demonstrate
how the senses capture and control one’s imagination. Figment arrives
Chapter 18: Touring the Theme Parks 331

at each of the areas to prove it’s far, far better to set your imagination
free. He invites you to his upside-down house, where a new perspec-
tive enhances your imagination. 
After you disembark from the ride, head for the “What If” labs, where
your kids can burn lots of energy while exercising their imaginations at a
number of interactive stations that allow them to conduct music and
experiment with video.
The pavilion’s main attraction is the 3-D Honey I Shrunk the Audience
ride, based on the Disney film Honey I Shrunk the Kids. Inside, mice terror-
ize you and, after you’re shrunk, a large cat adds to the trauma; then a
giant 5-year-old gives you a good shaking. Vibrating seats and tactile
effects enhance the 3-D action. Finally, everyone returns to proper size —
but not the dog, who offers up one final surprise.
The Land
The Land is Future World’s largest pavilion (a whopping 6 acres) and
showcases the wonders of food and the environment. Living with the
Land, a 14-minute boat ride through a simulated rain forest, an African
desert, and the Great Plains may be a tad too dry for visitors not inter-
ested in agriculture. New farming methods and experiments ranging
from hydroponics to plants growing in simulated Martian soil are show-
cased in real gardens. 
A 45-minute Behind the Seeds walking tour for gardeners and others who
want a more detailed agricultural lesson is offered daily and costs $8 for
adults and $6 for kids 3 to 9. Sign up at the Green Thumb Emporium near
the Sunshine Season Food Fair.
Live footage and animation mix in Circle of Life, a 15-minute, 70mm
motion picture based on The Lion King. The story line has Timon and
Pumbaa building a monument to the good life called Hakuna Matata
Lakeside Village, but their project, as Simba points out, is damaging the
savanna for other animals. It’s a fun but pointed environmental message.
The long-running Food Rocks production was recently closed to 
make room for the new Soarin’ ride. Borrowed from Disney’s California
Adventure park, where it’s one of the more popular rides, the experience
combines cinematic artistry and state-of-the-art motion technology as
guests are seated in mock-gliders and lifted 40 feet inside a giant projec-
tion-screen dome. Completely surrounded with the beauty and wonder
of the state of California, their elevated seats take them on a scenic 
tour over the Golden Gate Bridge, the Redwood forests, Napa Valley,
Yosemite, and more. Guests can even feel the sweeping winds and smell
fragrant orange blossoms and pine trees around them. It’s definitely a
one-of-a-kind experience and should not be missed, though the lines 
for this one can get very long. One has to wonder, though, why Disney
isn’t creating a Florida version of this ride because . . . well, Epcot is
in Florida.

The Living Seas
The Living Seas pavilion has a 5.7-million-gallon aquarium filled with
more than 4,000 sharks, barracudas, rays, dolphins, and other reef fish.
It starts with a film, The Seas, demonstrating the formation of the Earth
and the seas as a means to support life. You also can see other exhibits
such as a diving barrel used by Alexander the Great in 332 B.C. and Sir
Edmund Halley’s first diving bell (1697). After the films, you enter
“hydrolators” (a hokey elevator ride) and descend to the simulated
ocean floor and Sea Base Alpha. The two-level base displays numerous
exhibits dealing with various aspects of marine science and technology,
and — most important of all — you get close-up views through acrylic
windows of real denizens of the deep as they swim amidst a man-made
coral reef. Both kids and adults enjoy visiting the rescued manatees (sea
cows), which reside on the second level.
Be sure to check out the adorable Turtle Talk with Crush, which debuted
at The Living Seas in late 2004. Crush (from Finding Nemo), chitchats
with passersby from behind his undersea movie screen, engaging them
in conversation and telling a joke or two. This is a first-of-its-kind attrac-
tion using digital projection and voice-activated animation to create a
real-time experience. Your kids will get a huge kick out of it; you will, too.
Epcot’s DiveQuest program enables certified adult divers to participate
in a three-hour program that includes a 30-minute dive in the Living Seas
aquarium. The program costs $140. Call % 407-939-8687 for details.
Keep in mind, however, that you get more for your money at Discovery
Cove (later in this chapter) if you want to swim with the dolphins.
Test Track
Test Track is a $60 million marvel of a ride that combines GM engineer-
ing and Disney Imagineering. You can wait in line an hour or more during
peak periods, so use FASTPASS. During the last part of your wait, you
snake through displays about corrosion, crash tests, and more. The five-
minute ride follows what looks to be an actual highway. It includes brak-
ing tests, a hill climb, and tight S-curves in a six-passenger “convertible.”
The left front seat offers the most thrills as the vehicle moves through
the curves. There’s also a 12-second burst of speed that’s heart pumping
to the tune of 65 mph on the straightaway (with no traffic!). It’s the best
thrill ride in Epcot.
Universe of Energy
Ellen’s Energy Adventure, a 32-minute ride, features comedian Ellen
DeGeneres as an energy expert tutored by Bill Nye (the Science Guy) to
be a Jeopardy! contestant. An animated movie depicts the Earth’s molten
beginnings, its cooling, and the formation of fossil fuels. You then tour a
275-million-year-old, storm-wracked Earth where giant AudioAnimatronic
dragonflies, pterodactyls, dinosaurs, earthquakes, and streams of molten
lava surround you. The show ends with a vision of an energy-abundant
future and Ellen as a new Jeopardy! champion.
Chapter 18: Touring the Theme Parks 333

Wonders of Life
The focus of the Wonders of Life pavilion (you can’t miss the giant DNA
strand that marks its entrance) is on health and biology.
The entire Wonders of Life pavilion began opening on a limited schedule
(mostly during peak crowds to alleviate long lines on other rides) in
January 2004, prompting speculation that a new exhibit may be installed
here within the next few years.
The Making of Me, starring Martin Short, is a 15-minute film combining
live action with animation and spectacular in utero photography to
create a sweet introduction to the facts of life. Brief travels take visitors
back in time to witness his parents as children, their meeting at a college
dance, their wedding, and their decision to have a baby. Alongside
Short, Making of Me visitors view his development inside his mother’s
womb and witness his birth.
The presentation may prompt some pointed questions from young chil-
dren; therefore, I recommend it for ages 10 and older.
Didn’t get your fill of being shrunk at Imagination? Haven’t been shaken up
enough on a simulator? Try Body Wars, where you’re reduced to the size
of a cell for a rescue mission inside a human’s immune system (it reminds
many sci-fi fans of the Isaac Asimov classic novel Fantastic Voyage, and the
story line isn’t all that different). This motion-simulator takes you on a
wild ride through gale-force winds in the lungs and pounding heart cham-
bers. It’s nowhere near as cool as the similar Star Tours attraction at
Disney–MGM Studios (later in this chapter), but is still fun.
Engineers designed this ride from the last row of the car, so that’s the
best place to sit to get the most bang for your buck.
In the hilarious Cranium Command, Buzzy, an animatronic brain-pilot-in-
training in the Cranium Commando Squad, is charged with the daunting
task of controlling the brain of Bobby, a 12-year-old boy, during adoles-
cent traumas that include meeting a girl and a run-in with the principal.
The audience is seemingly seated inside Bobby’s head as Buzzy guides
him through his day — and gets chewed out every now and then by his
animated C.O., General Knowledge. Well-known actors and comedians,
including Charles Grodin, Jon Lovitz, and Dana Carvey, play the boy’s
body parts. This must-see attraction has a very loyal fan following and is
good for all ages.
Don’t skip the very funny preshow film at this attraction as it sets up the
action that happens inside. At The Fitness Fairgrounds, you can have
your tennis, golf, or baseball swing analyzed by experts. You can also get
a computer-generated evaluation of your health habits.

World Showcase
Adults and older kids with an appreciation of world history and cultural
shows enjoy World Showcase. Its 11 miniature nations open at 11 a.m.
daily and surround a 40-acre lagoon. All the showcase’s countries have
authentically indigenous architecture, landscaping, background music,
restaurants, and shops. The nations’ cultural facets are explored in art
exhibits, song and dance performances, and innovative rides, films, and
attractions. And all the employees in each pavilion are natives of the
country represented.
Most of these nations offer some kind of live entertainment throughout
the day. You may see acrobats, bagpipers, mariachi bands, storytellers,
belly dancers, and stilt walkers. Characters regularly appear in the
Showcase Plaza. Check your guide map/show schedule when you enter
the park. You can also find schedules posted near the entrance to each
country.
Those with kids should grab a copy of the Epcot Kids’ Guide at Guest
Relations upon entering the park; it uses a “K” in a red square to note
Kidcot Fun Stops inside the World Showcase. These play and learning
stations are for the younger set and allow them to stop at various World
Showcase countries, do crafts, get autographs, have Kidcot passports
stamped (these are available for purchase in most Epcot stores and make
a great souvenir), and chat with cast members native to those countries.
Your kids get the chance to learn about different countries and make a
souvenir to bring home. For more information, stop in at Guest Relations
when you get into the park. The stations open at 1 p.m. daily.
Finally, excellent shopping and dining opportunities are available at all
the pavilions. For details on dining inside the World Showcase, see
Chapter 17.
Canada
The pavilion’s highlight attraction is O Canada! — a dazzling, 18-minute,
360-degree CircleVision film that shows our northern neighbor’s scenic
wonders, from sophisticated Montréal to the thundering flight of thou-
sands of snow geese departing the St. Lawrence River.
The theater has no seats, and you stand for the entire production
(though there are lean rails).
The architecture and landscape in Canada include a mansard-roofed
replica of Ottawa’s 19th-century Château Laurier (here called the Hôtel
du Canada) and an Indian village complete with 30-foot replicas of
Ojibwa totem poles. The Canadian wilderness is reflected by a rocky
mountain (really made of concrete and chicken wire); a waterfall cascad-
ing into a white-water stream; and a miniforest of evergreens, stately
cedars, maples, and birch trees. Don’t miss the stunning floral display
inspired by Victoria’s world-renowned Butchart Gardens. Off Kilter enter-
tains visitors with New Age Celtic music.
Chapter 18: Touring the Theme Parks 335

China
You enter Epcot’s version of China through a triple-arched ceremonial
gate inspired by the Temple of Heaven in Beijing, a summer retreat for
Chinese emperors. Passing through the gate, you’ll see a half-size replica
of this ornately embellished red-and-gold circular temple, built in 1420
during the Ming dynasty. Gardens simulate those at Suzhou, with minia-
ture waterfalls, lotus ponds, and bamboo groves.
Inside the temple, you can watch Reflections of China, a 20-minute, 
360-degree CircleVision film (it debuted in spring 2003) that explores the
culture and landscapes in and around seven Chinese cities. Shot over a
two-month period in 2002, it visits Beijing, Shanghai, and the Great Wall
(begun 24 centuries ago!), among other places. 
Like Canada, the theater here has no seats, and you stand for the entire
production (though there are lean rails).
Land of Many Faces is an exhibit that introduces China’s ethnic peoples,
and entertainment is provided daily by the amazing Dragon Legend
Acrobats.
France
This pavilion focuses on France’s Belle Époque (Beautiful Age) — the
period from 1870 to 1910 — when art, literature, and architecture ruled.
You enter via a replica of the beautiful cast-iron Pont des Arts footbridge
over the Seine and find yourself in a park with bleached sycamores,
Bradford pear trees, flowering crape myrtle, and sculptured parterre
flower gardens inspired by Seurat’s painting A Sunday Afternoon on the
Island of La Grande Jatte. The grounds also include a 1⁄10-scale model of the
Eiffel Tower, which was built from Gustave Eiffel’s original blueprints.
The premiere attraction here is Impressions de France. Shown in the pala-
tial Palais du Cinema, a sit-down theater à la Fontainebleau, this 18-minute
film is a journey through diverse French landscapes projected on a vast,
200-degree wraparound screen and enhanced by the music of French com-
posers. Outside, grab a yummy French pastry and watch the antics of
Serveur Amusant, a comedic waiter, or the visual comedy of Le Mime
Roland.
Germany
Enclosed by castle walls, Germany offers ’wursts, oompah bands, and a
rollicking atmosphere. The clock tower in the central platz (plaza) is
embellished with a glockenspiel that heralds each hour with quaint
melodies. The Biergarten was inspired by medieval Rothenberg, while
16th-century building façades replicate a merchant’s hall in the Black
Forest and the town hall in Frankfurt’s Römerberg Square.
If you’re a model-train fanatic or visiting with young kids, don’t miss the
exquisitely detailed version of a small Bavarian town, complete with
working train station, located between Germany and Italy.
Part V: Visiting Central Florida: Mickey Mania 
336

Italy
Italy lures visitors over an arched stone footbridge to a replica of Venice’s
intricately ornamented pink-and-white Doge’s Palace. Other architectural
highlights include the 83-foot Campanile (bell tower) of St. Mark’s Square,
Venetian bridges, and a piazza enclosing a version of Bernini’s Neptune
Fountain. A garden wall suggests a backdrop of provincial countryside,
and citrus, cypress, pine, and olive trees frame a formal garden. Gondolas
are moored on the lagoon.
In the street-entertainment department, the seemingly lifeless forms of
Imaginum, A Statue Act fascinate visitors young and old daily, and the
hilarious World Showcase Players, who, at press time, were seen spoofing
Shakespeare’s Italian-set Taming of the Shrew here.
Japan
A flaming-red torii (gate of honor) on the banks of the lagoon and the
graceful blue-roofed Goju No To pagoda, inspired by an 8th-century
shrine built at Nara, welcome you to the Japan pavilion, which focuses
on Japan’s ancient culture. If you have some leisure time, enjoy the
exquisitely cultivated Japanese garden — it’s a haven of tranquility in a
place that’s anything but, and 90 percent of the plants you see are actu-
ally native to Japan. The Shishinden is inspired by the ceremonial and
coronation hall found in the Imperial Palace grounds at Kyoto, and the
Bijutsu-kan Gallery offers rotating exhibits ranging from 18th-century
Bunraki puppets to Japanese baseball.
Make sure that you include a performance of traditional Taiko drumming
by Matsuriza, which entertains guests daily. Japanese storytellers offer
up native tales every now and then.
Mexico
The music of mariachi bands greets you at Mexico’s festive showcase,
fronted by a Mayan pyramid modeled on the Aztec temple of Quetzalcoatl
(God of Life) and surrounded by dense Yucatán jungle landscaping. Just
inside the pavilion’s entrance, a museum exhibits rare Oaxacan wood
sculptures. Also inside the pyramid is El Rio del Tiempo (River of Time),
an eight-minute cruise through Mexico’s past and present (the audio-
animatronic dolls you encounter en route may remind you of those in 
the Magic Kingdom’s It’s a Small World). Along the river route, passengers
get a close-up look at the Mayan pyramid and the erupting Popocatepetl
volcano. 
Mariachi Cobre, a 12-piece mariachi ensemble, performs Tuesday through
Saturday.
Morocco
A replica of the world-famous Koutoubia Minaret, the prayer tower of a
12th-century mosque in Marrakesh, overlooks the very atmospheric
pavilion of Morocco, featuring the architectural styles of several cities
Chapter 18: Touring the Theme Parks 337

inside the North African kingdom. The exotic ambience is enhanced by
geometrically patterned tile work, hand-painted wood ceilings, and brass
lighting fixtures. The Medina (old city), entered via a replica of an arched
gateway in Fez, leads to a traditional Moroccan home and the narrow,
winding streets of the souk, a bustling marketplace where authentic hand-
icrafts are on display. The Medina’s courtyard centers on a replica of the
ornately tiled Najjarine Fountain in Fez. 
King Hassan II of Morocco took a personal interest in the pavilion when
it was built and dispatched royal artisans to assist in its construction.
Note the imperfections left in each mosaic tile; they were put there on
purpose in accordance with the Muslim belief that only Allah is perfect.
The Gallery of Arts and History contains ever-changing exhibits of
Moroccan art. A guided tour of the pavilion, Treasures of Morocco, runs
three times daily. (Check your show schedule.) Speaking of shows, the
band Mo’Rockin’ kicks things up with Arabian rock music on traditional
instruments.
Norway
The Norway pavilion’s stave church, located off a charming cobblestone
plaza and styled after the 13th-century Gol Church of Hallingdal, features
changing exhibits focusing on Norwegian art and culture. A replica of
Oslo’s 14th-century Akershus Castle is the setting for the pavilion’s
restaurant. Other buildings simulate the red-roofed cottages of Bergen
and the timber-sided farm buildings of the Nordic woodlands.
Norway includes a two-part attraction. Maelstrom, a boat ride in a
dragon-headed Viking vessel, travels Norway’s fjords and mythical
forests to the music of Peer Gynt. Along the way, you see polar bears
prowling the shore and are turned into frogs by trolls that cast a spell on
your boat. The watercraft crashes through a narrow gorge (two small
separate drops) and spins into the North Sea, where a storm is in
progress. (Don’t worry — this is a relatively calm ride, though some of
the thunder elements may frighten the very young.) The storm abates, a
princess’s kiss turns you into a human again, and you disembark to a
10th-century Viking village to view the 70mm film Norway, highlighting
history and culture (you can proceed through the theater to the exit if
you don’t want to watch the film).
United Kingdom
The United Kingdom pavilion evokes Merry Olde England through its
Britannia Square — a London-style park complete with copper-roofed
gazebo bandstand, a stereotypical red phone booth (it really works!), an
old-fashioned pub, a thatched cottage, and a statue of the Bard. Four
centuries of architecture — from the Tudor era all the way through the
English Regency period — line cobblestone streets. In the horticulture
department, there’s a formal garden with low box hedges in geometric
patterns, and the flagstone paths and a stone fountain replicating the
landscaping of 16th- and 17th-century palaces.
Part V: Visiting Central Florida: Mickey Mania 
338

Don’t miss The British Invasion, a group that impersonates the Beatles;
vivacious pub pianist Pam Brody; and Jason Wethington, a pub magician
who offers up Disney magic of the sleight-of-hand variety.
U.S.A.: The American Adventure
This flagship pavilion’s main building is a 108,000-square-foot Georgian
mansion and occupies the central spot in the World Showcase.
Notable U.S. landmarks that inspired Disney’s Imagineers in the design
of the building include Independence Hall, Monticello, and Colonial
Williamsburg. The action takes place in an elegant, colonial-style, 1,024-
seat theater loaded with Corinthian columns, chandeliers, elegant fab-
rics, and 12 marble statues symbolizing the 12 “Spirits of America.”
The flags you pass under as you enter the theater — 44 in all — include
every one that has flown over the United States throughout its history.
The actual production, a 29-minute CliffsNotes version of U.S. history, fea-
tures rousing music and a large cast of lifelike audio-animatronic figures,
including narrators Mark Twain and Ben Franklin. You follow the voyage
of the Mayflower, watch Jefferson writing the Declaration of Independence,
and witness Matthew Brady photographing a family that the Civil War is
about to divide. You can also witness Pearl Harbor and the Eagle going to
the moon. Teddy Roosevelt discusses the need for national parks; Susan
B. Anthony speaks out on women’s rights; Frederick Douglass discusses
slavery; and Chief Joseph talks about the plight of Native Americans. It’s
one of Disney’s best historical productions.
Entertainment includes the Spirit of America Fife & Drum Corps and the
Voices of Liberty a cappella group, which sings patriotic songs in the
lobby of the main theater between shows. Large-scale outdoor produc-
tions are often staged in the America Gardens Theatre, a 1,800-seat out-
door venue across from the main pavilion building.
Ending your day at Epcot
Epcot’s end-of-day celebration, IllumiNations, is a moving blend of fire-
works, lasers, and fountains in a display that’s signature Disney. The
show is worth the crowds that flock to the parking lot when it’s over
(just be sure to keep a firm grip on young kids).
You can find tons of good viewing points around the lagoon (one excellent
spot is the terrace at the Rose & Crown Pub in the United Kingdom pavil-
ion). That said, it’s best to stake your claim to a primo place a half-hour or
so before show time, which is listed in your entertainment schedule.
Disney–MGM Studios
Anyone who loves movies will enjoy wandering the realistic streets,
shops, sets, and back lots of this 110-acre combination theme park and
working studio. Filming is done here throughout the year, so you never
Chapter 18: Touring the Theme Parks 339

know whether you’re seeing slapstick or an actual taping. Stroll the
neighborhoods, which include Hollywood and Sunset boulevards, where
Art Deco movie sets recall the golden age of Hollywood. New York Street
is lined with miniature renditions of the Empire State and Chrysler build-
ings. It’s also an impromptu stage for street performers.
Checking out the best of Disney–MGM
Unlike the Magic Kingdom and Epcot, you can pretty much see
Disney–MGM’s 110 acres of attractions in one day if you arrive early.
Here’s a rundown of the best Disney–MGM has to offer:
 Backstage Pass: This uses sets from occasionally changing shows
and movies to give you a 25-minute, yawn-able tour of a production
facility. It’s a good one to skip if time is a factor.
 Beauty and the Beast Live on Stage: A 1,500-seat, covered
amphitheater provides the stage for this 25-minute, live Broadway-
style production of Beauty and the Beast adapted from the movie
version. Musical highlights include the rousing “Be Our Guest”
opening number and the poignant title song, featured in a romantic
waltz-scene finale. Arrive early to get a good seat.
 Disney–MGM Studios Backlot Tour: This 35-minute behind-the-
scenes tour starts on foot and then you board a tram for a ride
through Disney’s costume department, sets from popular (and not-
so-popular) TV shows and movies, and the domain of special-
effects wizards. The best comes when you reach Catastrophe
Canyon, where an “earthquake” causes a tanker truck to explode,
rocking the tram. Then a very large, very wet wave throws 70,000
gallons of water at you — some people do get doused.
 The Great Movie Ride: A slow journey down MGM’s memory lane,
it uses animatronic versions of Jimmy Cagney, John Wayne, and
Clint Eastwood to re-create some of their most memorable roles.
Live bandits then show up and blow up the bank on the set. One of
the bad guys kidnaps you and your mates, but he runs into the
space thing from Alien. Younger children could be frightened, and
older teens will be bored with this ride.
 Honey, I Shrunk the Kids Movie Set: An 11,000-square-foot play-
ground where everything is larger than life, it has a 30-foot-tall
thicket of grass, three-stories-high mushroom caps, and a friendly
ant that makes a suitable seat. Play areas include a 52-foot garden
hose with leaks, cereal loops that are 9-feet wide and cushioned for
jumping, and a waterfall that cascades from a leaf to a dell of fern
sprouts. It’s great for small children.
 Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular: Spectacular is a good
word for this 30-minute extravaganza, guaran-double-teed to keep
you on the edge of your seat. The show is held in a big, open-air
pavilion and uses some adult volunteers. It begins with Indy rap-
pelling down from the rafters, and the nifty special effects soon

have him dodging spikes, falling into a pit of molten something-or-
other, and then outrunning fire, steam, and a large boulder that
nearly flattens him — all before the first commercial break. It may
be a little intense for kids under 6.
 Jim Henson’s Muppet*Vision 3-D: This in-your-face, 25-minute
spectacle allows the humor of the late Jim Henson to live on
through Miss Piggy, Kermit, and the gang. A delight for all ages, this
production mixes 3-D effects and sensory gags with puppets and
live-action characters. You’ll encounter flying Muppets, cream pies,
and cannonballs, as well as high winds, fiber-optic fireworks,
bubble showers, and even an actual spray of water.
 The Magic of Disney Animation: Disney characters come alive at
the stroke of a brush or pencil as you tour glass-walled animation
studios. Walter Cronkite and Robin Williams explain what’s going on
via video monitors. They also star in a very funny eight-minute
Peter Pan–themed film about the basics of animation. The 35-minute
tour, recommended for ages 8 and up, also includes a grand finale of
magical moments from classic Disney films.
 Lights, Motors, Action! Extreme Stunt Show: Inspired by the popu-
lar Stunt Show Spectacular at Disneyland Paris, this high-octane stunt
show features specially designed cars, motorcycles and jet skis,
plus special effects — with audience members pulled into the fun.
Insiders will reveal show secrets, detailing how stunts are created,
designed, and filmed for the movies. Filmed images are revealed on
an oversized screen, illustrating how the use of different camera
angles can add drama to filmed scenes. It’s entertaining and certainly
offers its share of thrills, but it’s not as engaging as the Indiana Jones
production unless you’re a car buff. The new show is part of a larger
redevelopment of the back-lot area of Disney–MGM Studios, which
has added new cityscapes for Chicago and San Francisco to the
existing New York City skyline.
 Playhouse Disney — Live on Stage! Younger audiences (2 to 8
years old) love this 20-minute show, where they meet characters
from Bear in the Big Blue House, The Book of Pooh, and other 
stories. The show encourages preschoolers to dance, sing, and play
along with the cast. Check your show schedule for times.
 Rock ’n’ Roller Coaster: Wow! This inverted roller coaster — the
fastest off the line in Orlando — is one of the best thrill rides that
Walt Disney World has to offer and is certainly not for younger
kids or folks with neck or back problems, faint hearts, or a ten-
dency toward motion sickness. Fast and furious, this indoor ride
puts you in a 24-passenger stretch limo, outfitted with 120 speak-
ers that blare Aerosmith at 32,000 watts. Faster than you can
scream, “Stop the music!” (around 2.8 seconds, actually), you
shoot from 0 to 60 mph and into the first inversion at 5 Gs. Riders
must be at least 48 inches tall.
Sounds Dangerous Starring Drew Carey: Drew Carey (on film) pro-
vides laughs while dual audio technology provides some incredible
Chapter 18: Touring the Theme Parks 341

hair-raising effects during a 12-minute mixture of movie and live
action at ABC Sound Studios. You feel like you’re right in the middle
of the action of a TV pilot featuring undercover police work and
plenty of amusing mishaps. Even when the picture disappears, you
continue the chase via headphones that demonstrate “3-D” sound
effects such as a roomful of angry bees, a herd of galloping ele-
phants, and a deafening auto race.
Most of the show takes place in total darkness, so you may want to
think twice before bringing really young children here.
 Star Tours: Your journey to a place far, far away begins with a wind-
ing walk (a line) through a bunch of Star Wars ’droids and a preride
warning about high turbulence, sharp drops, and sudden turns.
Star Tours is a virtual ride where you go nowhere, but you feel like
you do. The ride starts kind of slow, but it finishes fast, as you soar
through space in a good-guy fighter, with R2-D2 and C-3PO helping
you make passes through the canals of Lord Vader’s mother ship.
Riders must be at least 40 inches tall.
 The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror: If you like leaving your stom-
ach at several levels, you’ll love this ride. Its legend says that during
a violent storm on Halloween night 1939, lightning struck the
Hollywood Tower Hotel, causing an entire wing and an elevator full
of people to disappear. And you’re about to meet them as you star
in a special episode of The Twilight Zone. After various spooky
adventures, the ride ends in a dramatic climax: a terrifying, 13-story
free-fall into The Twilight Zone! At 199-feet, it’s the tallest Walt
Disney World attraction. You must be 40 inches tall to ride.
 Voyage of the Little Mermaid: Hazy lighting helps paint a picture
of an underwater world in a 17-minute show that combines live per-
formances, movie clips, puppetry, and special effects. Sebastian
sings “Under the Sea,” Ariel performs “Part of Your World,” and the
evil, tentacled Ursula, 12 feet tall and 10 feet wide, belts out “Poor
Unfortunate Soul.”
 Who Wants to Be a Millionaire — Play It: Forget about winning $1
million — it ain’t happening here — but contestants earn points for
prizes ranging from collectible pins to a trip to New York to meet
Regis Philbin. Based on Disney-owned ABC TV’s game show, the
theme-park version features lifelines (such as asking the audience or
calling a stranger on two phones set up in the park). Contestants get
a shot at up to 15 multiple-choice questions in the climb to the top.
Games run continuously in the 600-seat studio. Audience members
play along on keypads. The fastest to answer qualifying questions
become contestants.
Parades and fireworks
It’s hard not to be in awe of the choreography, laser lights, and fireworks
that are the core of Fantasmic!, a 25-minute extravaganza. Shooting
comets, great balls of fire, and animated fountains are among the special
Part V: Visiting Central Florida: Mickey Mania 
342

effects that really amaze the audience. The cast includes 50 performers,
a giant dragon, a king cobra, and 1 million gallons of water — most of it
orchestrated by a sorcerer mouse who looks very familiar. The ample
amphitheater holds 9,000 souls. If you want to avoid a real traffic jam
after the show, arrive up to an hour early and sit on the right (the the-
ater empties right to left).
A dinner package available at The Hollywood Brown Derby, Mama
Melrose’s Italian Ristorante, and Hollywood & Vine Café allows you pre-
ferred seating at Fantasmic! There’s no extra charge — just eat entrees at
one of the restaurants before the show, and you can wiggle into a reserved
seating area right up until ten minutes before show time, though it’s not a
specific seat. You can only make arrangements for the package at Guest
Relations in the park or at a Disney resort, and you must tell the reserva-
tion taker you want the Fantasmic! package.
Animal Kingdom
The biggest knock against Disney’s fourth theme park is that seeing the
animals is sometimes difficult. Because the park is as animal-friendly as
it is people-friendly, the wildlife can escape the heat, and your view, if
they choose. However, if your timing is right, you’ll see African lions,
giraffes, cheetahs, white rhinos, lowland gorillas, and hippos. You’ll also
bump into some that may be new to you, such as bongos (the antelopes,
not the drums) and naked mole rats.
Your best bet for animal viewing is to arrive in time for the park’s open-
ing (usually 8 a.m., but sometimes an hour earlier) or to come here
around closing or during winter cold spells. Like Magic Kingdom, this
park has several areas, or lands.
The Oasis
Your introduction to Animal Kingdom, The Oasis is one of the better
places to see animals early in the day. The lush vegetation, streams, grot-
toes, and waterfalls on either side of the walkway are good places to spot
wallabies, miniature deer, anteaters, sloths, iguanas, tree kangaroos,
otters, and macaws.
Discovery Island
After you pass through The Oasis, head straight onto Discovery Island,
which is the hub for Animal Kingdom’s five lands. This is another animal-
viewing area, where you may see wood ducks, flamingos, kangaroos, and
small-clawed otters.
Chapter 18: Touring the Theme Parks 343

Here are a couple of the highlights in this section of the park:
 It’s Tough to Be a Bug! Take the walkway through the Tree of Life’s
50-foot base, grab a pair of 3-D glasses, and settle into a sometimes
creepy-crawly seat. Based on the Disney-Pixar film, A Bug’s Life, the
special effects in this multimedia adventure are pretty impressive.
Although it may not be a good choice for kids under 4 (it’s dark and
loud) or bug haters, this attraction is a fun and sometimes-poignant
look at life from a smaller perspective. The stars include ants, bee-
tles, spiders, and — oh, no! — a stinkbug.
 Tree of Life: Fourteen stories tall, this man-made tree and its carved
animals are the work of Disney artists, who worked for over a year
on its carved, free-form animal sculptures. It’s impressive, with 8,000
limbs, 103,000 leaves, and 325 mammals, reptiles, amphibians, bugs,
birds, dinosaurs, and Mickeys carved into its trunk, limbs, and roots.
Camp Minnie-Mickey
Youngsters love this place. It’s a favorite hangout for several Disney char-
acters from the forest and jungle, including Simba from The Lion King and
Baloo from The Jungle Book. Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, Pluto, Donald, Daisy,
and a variety of other stars also make appearances from time to time
around this woody retreat, which resembles an Adirondack summer
camp. The big guns here are as follows:
 Festival of the Lion King: Held at the Lion King Theater, this rous-
ing 28-minute show is the best in Animal Kingdom and one of the
top three shows in all of Orlando’s theme parks. The several-times-
per-day extravaganza celebrates nature’s diversity with a talented,
colorfully attired cast of singers, dancers, and life-size critters that
lead the way to an inspiring sing-along. The action takes place
onstage and around the audience.
 Pocahontas and Her Forest Friends: The wait to see Pocahontas
and Her Forest Friends can be nightmarish, and the 15-minute show
isn’t close to the caliber of Festival of the Lion King and Tarzan Rocks!
(later in this chapter). In this show, Pocahontas, Grandmother
Willow, and some forest creatures hammer home the importance of
treating nature with respect.
Africa
Enter through the town of Harambe, which means “coming together” in
Swahili. Costumed employees greet you as you enter the buildings. The
whitewashed structures, built of coral stone and thatched with reed
brought from Africa, surround a central marketplace, rich with local
wares and colors. The best attractions here include the following:
 Kilimanjaro Safaris: This attraction is one of the few rides and the
best animal-viewing venue in this kingdom. But remember what I
told you about the animals being scarce during the middle of the
Part V: Visiting Central Florida: Mickey Mania 
344

day, especially in the heat of summer. After you hit the end of the
line, you board a large truck, and then you’re off on a bouncy ride
through what pretends to be Africa. The animals are real and
include black rhinos, hippos, Nile crocodiles, zebras, wildebeests,
and lions.
Arrive early! Lines can be an hour long or worse. Definitely con-
sider using FASTPASS, unless you can get there within 15 minutes of
the park’s opening.
 Pangani Falls Exploration Trail: You can get a pretty good look at
birds and the ever-active mole rats along the trail, but the gorillas —
including a silverback with his family — are the main event. Lines
that grow to three or more people deep, when animals do material-
ize, can also make viewing difficult.
 Rafiki’s Planet Watch: This area of Africa includes Conservation
Station, which offers a look at how Disney cares for animals inside
the park. You’ll walk past a series of nurseries and veterinarian sta-
tions. The problem is that these facilities need staff in order to be
interesting and there is no guarantee that anyone will be working
when you visit. Affection Section gives you a chance to cuddle
some friendly animals (including goats and pot-belly pigs), while
Habitat Habit! is home to some smaller animals, such as cotton-top
tamarinds.
Asia
Disney’s Imagineers have outdone themselves in creating the mythical
kingdom of Anadapour. The intricately painted artwork at the front is
appealing, and it also helps make the lines seem to move a little faster.
Also, watch for (with little prior announcement) the appearance of local
youngsters performing Asian dances. Here is a list of the top attractions: 
 Flights of Wonder: Mixing live-animal action with a Disney charac-
ter show, Flights of Wonder has undergone several transformations
since the park opened. It’s a low-key break that has a few laughs,
but it’s not much by bird-show standards.
 Kali River Rapids: White-water fanatics will scoff, but for a theme-
park raft ride, it’s pretty good — slightly better, than Congo River
Rapids at Busch Gardens (see Chapter 14), but not as good as
Popeye & Bluto’s Bilge-Rat Barges in Islands of Adventure (later in
this chapter). Its churning water mimics real rapids, and optical
illusions make you wonder if you’re about to go over the falls. You
will get wet. And lines are frequently long. This ride has a 38-inch
height minimum.
 Maharajah Jungle Trek: Disney keeps its promise to provide up-
close views of animals with this exhibit. If you don’t show up in the
midday heat, you’ll see Bengal tigers through the thick glass.
Nothing but air divides you from dozens of giant fruit bats hanging
Chapter 18: Touring the Theme Parks 345

in what appears to be a courtyard. (If you have a phobia, you can
bypass this area, but the bats are harmless.) Komodo dragons, gib-
bons, and other monkeys might also be on view.
Dinoland U.S.A.
Here’s Disney’s attempt to capitalize on the dinosaur craze inspired by
Jurassic Park and other films. To enter this area, you pass under Olden
Gate Bridge, a 40-foot-tall Brachiosaurus reassembled from excavated
fossils. Until late summer 1999, Dinoland had three paleontologists work-
ing on the very real skeleton of Sue, a monstrously big Tyrannosaurus
rex unearthed in the Black Hills of South Dakota in 1990. The paleontolo-
gists patched and assembled the bones here, mainly because Disney
helped pay for the project. Alas, Sue has moved to her permanent home
at The Field Museum in Chicago, but a cast replica of her 67-million-year-
old bones, called Dino-Sue on the handout guide maps, is on display.
Here are Dinoland’s best attractions: 
 The Boneyard: Kids love this play area, and it’s a great place for
parents to catch a second wind. Little ones can slide and climb
over a simulated paleontology site, and they can squeeze through
the fossils and skeletons of a triceratops and a brontosaurus.
 Dinosaur: This ride hurls you through darkness in a CTX Rover
time machine, past snarling dinosaurs that are a little hokey. It’s far
from a smooth ride, and some kids may find the dinosaurs and
darkness frightening. However, Dinosaur is as close as Animal
Kingdom comes to a thrill ride — a herky-jerky, twisting-turning
ride in which you and 20 other passengers try to save the last
dinosaur worth saving. Riders must be at least 40 inches tall.
 Primeval Whirl: Although this twin, carnival-style coaster doesn’t
have inversions, it does have a lot of spinning action in rider-
controlled cars that whirl by asteroids and dinosaurs that pop up
along the track. The ride has tight loops, short dips, and a final spin
that sends you into the gaping jaws of a fossilized dinosaur.
Primeval Whirl has a 48-inch height minimum.
 Tarzan Rocks! This 28-minute, several-times-per-day show pulses
with music and occasional aerial theatrics. Phil Collins’s movie
soundtrack supports a cast of 27, including tumblers and in-line
skating daredevils who really get the audience into the act. The
costumes and music are spectacular, second in Animal Kingdom
only to Festival of the Lion King in Camp Minnie-Mickey (earlier in
this section).
 Triceratops Spin: The principle is pretty much the same as The
Magic Carpets of Aladdin and Dumbo the Flying Elephant at WDW’s
Magic Kingdom (earlier in this chapter). In this case, cars that look
like cartoon dinosaurs are attached to arms that circle a hub while
moving up and down and all around. Most children age 2 to 6 love it.

Universal Orlando: An Overview
Team Universal’s original park, Universal Studios Florida, is similar to
Disney–MGM Studios in that it spends a ton of time and money to plug
its movies and characters. Here, that means visitors get a healthy dose
of Earthquake, Terminator, Back to the Future, Jaws, E.T., and more. Its
second park, Islands of Adventure, rules Orlando in thrill rides, thanks
to Dueling Dragons, Incredible Hulk Coaster, Jurassic Park River
Adventure, and Dudley Do-Right’s Ripsaw Falls.
Single-day tickets cost $59.75 for adults, $48 for kids 3 to 9. That total 
doesn’t include the 6 percent sales tax or, if you’re driving to the park, the
$8 parking charge. For more information on tickets and on Universal’s mul-
tiday passes call % 800-711-0080 or 407-363-8000 or visit www.universal
orlando.com on the Web.
One multiday, multi-park option is the FlexTicket. This is the most eco-
nomical way to see the various “other-than-Disney” parks. With the
FlexTicket, you pay one price to visit any of the participating parks
during a 14-day period. A four-park pass to Universal Studios Florida,
Islands of Adventure, Wet ’n’ Wild, and SeaWorld is $184.95 for adults
and $150.95 for children 3 to 9. A five-park pass, which adds Busch
Gardens in Tampa, is $224.95 for adults and $189.95 for kids.
Universal Express is a line-beating program for guests staying at
Universal Orlando resorts. Under the three-tiered system, guests of the
Portofino Bay, Hard Rock, and Royal Pacific hotels (see Chapter 17)
only need to show their room keys to get at or near the front of the line
for most rides. Multiday ticket buyers can go to special kiosks in the two
parks and make reservations on up to three rides at a time, getting two
windows of time in which to return for each. Guests can make more
reservations when those are used or expire. Single-day ticket holders
can make one reservation at a time.
Universal Studios Florida
Universal matches Disney stride for stride, and in some cases is a half-
step ahead, when it comes to cutting-edge rides. Real as well as virtual
thrills, terrific special effects, mammoth screens, and 3-D action are part
of its successful mix. The rides and shows at Universal are located in six
zones: Hollywood, New York, Production Central, San Francisco/Amity,
Woody Woodpecker’s KidZone, and World Expo.
Hollywood
This area is to the right of the Front Lot, where you enter. The main
streets are Rodeo Drive, Hollywood Boulevard, and Sunset Boulevard.
Here’s a list of the best that Hollywood has to offer:
Chapter 18: Touring the Theme Parks 347

 Terminator 2: 3-D Battle Across Time: This attraction is billed as
“the quintessential sight and sound experience for the 21st century!”
Live actors and six giant Cyborgs interact with Arnie, who appears
onscreen (actually there are three huge screens). The 3-D effects are
among the best in Orlando. (When liquid mercury falls from the
screen, cold water hits your legs.) It’s a must-see, but little kids may
find it a bit intense. This show is rated PG-13.
 The Gory, Gruesome & Grotesque Horror Make-up Show: At this
show, you’ll get a behind-the-scenes look at how monster makeup
is done, including the transformation scenes from such movies as
The Fly. This show is rated PG-13.
 Lucy: A Tribute: If you loved Lucille Ball, you’ll adore viewing these
exhibits, which include classic shows, costumes, scripts and even
rare home movies.
New York
New York is near the back of the park and includes rides and shows
along 42nd and 57th streets, Park Avenue, and Delancy Street. The pre-
miere attraction in this section is Twister — Ride It Out. The curtain
rises in the movie town of Wakita, where Universal engineers have cre-
ated a five-story funnel cloud by injecting 2 million cubic feet of air per
minute (enough to fill four full-size blimps). Power lines spark and fall,
an oak splits, and the storm rumbles at a rock-concert level as cars,
trucks, and a cow fly about, while the audience watches from just 20 feet
away. In the finale, the floor begins to buckle at your feet. This show is
rated PG-13.
The Big Gorilla has lost out to a mummy. Park favorite Kongfrontation, a
ride that had been at Universal since its opening, closed in 2003 to make
room for Revenge of the Mummy, an indoor roller coaster based on The
Scorpion King from The Mummy Returns. Billed as a “psychological thrill
ride,” the $40 million indoor roller coaster relies on speed, pyrotechnics,
and robotics to induce screams as riders hurtle through Egyptian sets,
passageways, and tombs in cars that move forward and in reverse. Even
the preshow for the waiting victims — riders, I mean riders — lends to
the ominous atmosphere and includes several surprise interactive areas
and a story line that plays out as you get closer to boarding the ride. 
The five-minute journey aims to prey on one’s inner phobias via encoun-
ters with overhead flames, pitch black darkness, insects. and a skeletal
warrior that hops aboard your coaster.
Production Central
Production Central is directly behind and to the left of the Front Lot. Its
main thoroughfares are Nickelodeon Way and Seventh and Eighth
avenues. Here are some of the area’s highlights:
Part V: Visiting Central Florida: Mickey Mania 
348

 Nickelodeon Studios: Tour the soundstages where Nick shows are
produced, see concept pilots, visit the kitchen where Gak and green
slime are made, and try new Sega video games. This 45-minute
behind-the-scenes tour is a fun escape, and there’s a lot of audience
participation. One child volunteer always gets slimed.
The tour usually doesn’t open until at least 11 a.m., sometimes noon.
 Shrek 4-D: In this fractured, 4-D fairytale you will be able to see,
hear, and smell the adventure thanks to motion simulators,
OgreVision glasses, and other special effects, including spritzes of
water. The attraction picks up where the movie left off, letting you
join Shrek and Princess Fiona on their honeymoon. The preride fea-
tures the ghostly return of the vertically challenged Lord Farquaad.
 Jimmy Neutron’s Rocket Ride: This spinning, careening adventure
has you battling Yokians — evil, egg-shaped aliens — on a journey
in which you also encounter cartoon favorites such as SpongeBob
SquarePants and the Rugrats.
San Francisco
This L-shaped zone faces the waterfront, and its attractions line The
Embarcadero and Amity Avenue. Here are some highlights:
 Earthquake — The Big One: Sparks fly shortly after you board a
BART train. The whopper — 8.3 on the Richter scale! — hits as you
pull into the Embarcadero Station, and you’re trapped as a propane
truck bursts into flames, a runaway train comes hurtling at you,
and the station floods (65,000 gallons of water cascade down the
steps, but not onto passengers).
 Jaws: As your boat heads into a 7-acre, 5-million-gallon lagoon, an
ominous dorsal fin appears on the horizon. What follows is a series
of attacks from a 3-ton, 32-foot-long, mechanical great white shark
that tries to sink its urethane teeth into your hide — or at least into
your boat’s hide. A 30-foot wall of flame, caused by burning fuel,
surrounds the boat in this loud, $45-million attraction.
 The Wild, Wild, Wild West Stunt Show: Stunt people demonstrate
falls from three-story balconies, gun and whip fights, dynamite
explosions, and other Wild West staples. This is a well-performed,
lively show that’s especially popular with foreign visitors who have
celluloid visions of the American West.
Woody Woodpecker’s KidZone
This section of the park contains rides and attractions sure to please the
littlest members of your party. If you’re traveling with a number of
youngsters, plan on spending a lot of time here. Here’s an A-list list of
kid-friendly attractions:
Chapter 18: Touring the Theme Parks 349

 A Day in the Park with Barney: Set in a parklike theater-in-the-
round, this 25-minute musical stars the Purple One, Baby Bop, and
BJ. It uses song, dance, and interactive play to deliver an environ-
mental message. This show can be the highlight of your youngster’s
day. Next door, the playground has treehouses to explore plus lots
of other things to intrigue little visitors.
 E.T. Adventure: Soar with E.T. on a mission to save his ailing planet,
traveling through the forest and into space aboard a star-bound bicy-
cle. You also meet some new characters Steven Spielberg created for
the ride, including Botanicus, Tickli Moot Moot, Horn Flowers, and
Tympani Tremblies.
 Woody Woodpecker’s Nuthouse Coaster: This is the top attraction
in the KidZone. Sure, it’s a kids’ ride, but the Nuthouse Coaster will
thrill some moms and dads, too. Although it’s only 30 feet at its
peak, it offers quick, corkscrew turns while you sit in a miniature
steam train. It’s the same kind of ride as the Barnstormer at Goofy’s
Wiseacre Farm in the Magic Kingdom.
The ride only lasts 50 seconds, and waits can be 30 minutes, but few
kids will let you miss it.
If you’re looking for more to do in Woody Woodpecker’s KidZone,
Fievel’s Playland is a wet, Western-themed playground with a house
to climb and a small water slide. Curious George Goes to Town has
water- and ball-shooting cannons plus a huge water tower that emp-
ties (after an alarm), drenching anyone who doesn’t run for cover.
Nearby, Animal Planet Live! offers an amusing 20-minute, behind-
the-scenes look at the Animal Planet Network with a heart-warming
multimedia show starring a host of furry actors (many of them 
rescued from shelters or pounds before getting their big break). 
World Expo
The smallest zone in Universal Studios Florida offers a lot of punch in its
two rides. World Expo is on Exposition Boulevard, between San Francisco/
Amity and KidZone. The dual highlights are as follows:
 Back to the Future — The Ride: This attraction offers a chance at
time travel in a simulator that looks like a DeLorean. Six to eight of
you are packed into a car, after a video briefing from Christopher
Lloyd, also known as Dr. Emmett Brown. Biff the Bully has stolen a
similar vehicle, and you have to catch him. The fate of the universe
is in your hands. The huge screen makes this ride very intense, but if
you begin to feel a little woozy, just stick your neck out of your car —
literally. You can see the other cars, lending the very true perspec-
tive that you’re really only in a theater. This ride has a 40-inch height
minimum.
 Men in Black: Alien Attack: Board a six-passenger cruiser, and
you’ll buzz the streets of New York, using laser tag–style guns to
splatter 80 kinds of bug-eyed invaders. This four-minute ride relies
Part V: Visiting Central Florida: Mickey Mania 
350

on 360-degree spins rather than speed for its thrill factor. At the
ride’s conclusion, a giant roach swallows you, and you must then
blast your way out (getting doused with bug guts — warm water)
for your efforts. Will Smith rates you as galaxy defender, atomically
average, or bug bait. This ride has a 42-inch height minimum.
Islands of Adventure
Universal’s second park opened in 1999 with a collection of fast, fun
rides wrapped in a 110-acre package. Roller coasters thunder above its
pedestrian walkways, water rides careen through the center of the park,
and theme restaurants are camouflaged to match their surroundings.
The $1 billion park is divided into six areas: the Port of Entry, where
you’ll find shops and eateries, and the themed sections: Seuss Landing,
Toon Lagoon, Jurassic Park, Marvel Super Hero Island, and The Lost
Continent. Islands of Adventure has a large menu of thrill rides and
coasters, plus a growing stable of play areas for younger guests.
Nine of the 14 major rides at Islands of Adventure have minimum heights
(40–54 inches), so if you have very young children, you’re better off at
another park.
Port of Entry
Think of this as the starting line. Designed to resemble a marketplace
that you’d find in Indiana Jones, Port of Entry is where the park pushes
stuff like junk food, souvenirs, and other completely unnecessary items
while you’re still suffering from ticket shock. From here, you can walk to
the five other islands dotting the lagoon.
Seuss Landing
The main attractions in Seuss Landing, a 10-acre island, are aimed at the
younger set, though anyone who loved the good Doctor as a child will
enjoy some nostalgic fun on the colorful rides. Here are some of the
attractions you’ll find: 
 Caro-Seuss-El: This not-so-ordinary carousel replaces the traditional
wooden horses with seven whimsical Seussian characters (54 total
mounts), including Cowfish, Elephant Birds, and Mulligatawnies.
They move up and down, as well as in and out. Pull the reins to make
their eyes blink or heads bob as you twirl through the riot of color
surrounding the ride.
 The Cat in the Hat: All aboard the couch! In this case, they’re six-
passenger futons that steer 1,800 people an hour through 18 show
scenes. Any Seuss fan will recognize the giant candy-striped hat
looming over the entrance and probably many of the scenes from
the chaotic journey inside. It’s one of the signature experiences of
Islands of Adventure, though you may find it tame.
Chapter 18: Touring the Theme Parks 351

 If I Ran the Zoo: If I Ran the Zoo is an interactive playland for kids
who enjoy everything from flying water snakes to getting a chance
to tickle the toes of a Seussian animal. The 19 play stations are a
nice place to let your kids burn off some excited energy.
 One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish: On this attraction, your
controls allow you to move your funky fish up or down 15 feet, as
you spin around on an arm attached to a hub. Watch out for squirt
posts, which spray unsuspecting riders who don’t follow the ride’s
rhyme scheme (and sometimes the ones who do follow it). Riders
must be 48 inches or taller to ride without an adult; smaller children
can ride when accompanied.
Marvel Super Hero Island
Thrill junkies love the twisting, turning rides on this island that’s filled
with building-tall murals of Marvel Super Heroes. Children can meet
some of their favorite heroes in front of The Amazing Adventures of
Spider-Man. Spidey’s ride is just one of the highlights on this island,
which includes the following attractions:
 The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man: A primo ride, it com-
bines moving vehicles, filmed 3-D action, and special effects
themed around the original webmaster. The script: While you’re
touring the Daily Bugle newspaper — yikes! — the boys in black
hats steal the Statue of Liberty. Your mission is to help Spidey get
it back. Passengers wearing 3-D glasses squeal, and computer-
generated objects fly toward their 12-person cars, which spin and
soar through this comic-book universe. There’s also a simulated
400-foot drop that feels an awful lot like the real thing. This ride has
a 40-inch height minimum.
 Dr. Doom’s Fearfall: Look! Up in the sky! Uh-oh, it’s you falling 200
feet, if you’re courageous enough to climb aboard. This towering
metal skeleton provides screams that you can hear far into the day
and night. The plot line: You’re touring a lab when something goes
horribly wrong as Doctor Doom tries to cure you of fear. You’re
fired to the top of the ride, with feet dangling, and dropped in inter-
vals, leaving your stomach at several levels. The fall feels like the
Tower of Terror at Disney–MGM Studios (earlier in this chapter)
but with the additional sensation of hanging free. This ride has a 
52-inch height minimum.
 Incredible Hulk Coaster: Get ready to rocket from a dark tunnel
into the sunlight while accelerating from 0 to 40 mph in two sec-
onds. Although it’s only two-thirds the speed of Disney–MGM’s Rock
’n’ Roller Coaster (earlier in this chapter), this ride is in broad day-
light and you can see the asphalt! After launching, you spin upside
down 128 feet from the ground, feel weightless, and careen through
the center of the park over the heads of other visitors. Coaster
lovers will be pleased to know that this ride, which lasts 2 minutes
Part V: Visiting Central Florida: Mickey Mania 
352

and 15 seconds, includes seven rollovers and two deep drops. It has
a 54-inch height minimum.
 Storm Force Accelatron. This ride is little more than a 22nd-century
version of the Magic Kingdom’s Mad Tea Party and its spinning
teacups. While aboard, you and the X-Men’s Storm try to defeat the
evil Magneto by spinning faster and faster. In addition to creating
upset stomachs, your motion creates a thunderstorm of sound and
light, which gives Storm all the power she needs.
Toon Lagoon
More than 150 life-size, sculpted cartoon images let you know you’ve
entered Toon Lagoon, dedicated to your favorite Sunday funnies. Here’s
what you can find:
 Comic Strip Lane: Beetle Bailey, Hagar the Horrible, and Dagwood
and Blondie are just a few of the 80 characters in this comic-strip
neighborhood. Although this attraction is fun for visuals and pas-
sive moments, skip it if you’re on a tight schedule.
 Dudley Do-Right’s Ripsaw Falls: On this splashy flume ride that
drops 75 feet at 50 mph, your task is to save Nell from Snidely
Whiplash. The boats take you around a 400,000-gallon lagoon and
plunge you 15 feet below the water’s surface, but this is mainly
hype — the water is contained on either side of you. Note: You will
get very wet, despite the contained water. This ride has a 44-inch
height minimum.
 Me Ship, The Olive: This three-story boat is a family-friendly play-
land with dozens of interactive activities from bow to stern. Kids
can toot whistles, clang bells, or play the organ. Kids 6 and up love
Cargo Crane, where they can drench riders on Popeye & Bluto’s
Bilge-Rat Barges (see the next listing).
 Popeye & Bluto’s Bilge-Rat Barges: Here’s a turning, twisting raft
ride with the same kind of vehicle as Kali River Rapids at Disney’s
Animal Kingdom (earlier in this chapter), but this one’s faster and
bouncier. You’ll get wet from the rapids as well as the water cannons
fired by guests at Me Ship, The Olive (see the previous listing). The
12-passenger rafts bump and dip their way along a course lined with
villains, most notably Bluto and Sea Hag, and a twirling octopus boat
wash. This ride has a 42-inch height minimum.
Jurassic Park
All the basics from Steven Spielberg’s wildly successful films and some of
the high-tech wizardry are incorporated into this lushly landscaped tropi-
cal locale that includes a replica of the visitor center from the movie.
Expect long lines at the River Adventure and pleasant surprises at the
Discovery Center, both described in the following list of attractions:
Chapter 18: Touring the Theme Parks 353

 Camp Jurassic: Designed along the same lines as The Boneyard in
Disney’s Animal Kingdom (earlier in this chapter), this play area
has everything from lava pits to a rain forest. Watch out for the
spitters (you’ll get wet) that lurk in dark caves. The multilevel area
offers lots of places for kids to crawl, explore, and lose a little
steam. Keep a close eye on young children; it’s easy to get turned
around inside the caverns.
 Discovery Center: Relax while you discover something new. The
center has life-size dinosaur replicas and some interactive games,
including a sequencer that lets you combine your DNA with a
dinosaur’s. The Beasaur exhibit gives you a chance to see and hear
as the dinosaurs did. For the highlight, watch a tiny, animatronic
velociraptor hatch in the lab.
 Jurassic Park River Adventure: Although this attraction begins
slowly, it soon throws you into a world of stormy skies and five-
story dinosaurs, including a T-Rex, one of the most fearsome bul-
lies on the planet. To escape, you take a heart-stopping 85-foot
plunge in a flume that’s quick enough to leave your fingerprints
embedded in the restraining bar’s padded foam. Did I mention that
you’ll get soaked? This ride has a 42-inch height minimum.
 Pteranodon Flyers: Unlike the traditional gondolas in sky rides, on
Pteranodon Flyers, your feet hang free from the two-seat, skeletal
flyers and there’s little but a restraining belt between you and the
ground. Now that I’ve scared you, this is a kiddie ride — single pas-
sengers must be between 36 and 56 inches tall; adults can board only
when accompanying someone that size.
 Triceratops Discovery Trail: Meet a “living” dinosaur and find out
about the care and feeding of the 24-foot-long, 10-foot-high anima-
tronic Triceratops from its trainers. The creature’s responses to
touch include realistic blinks, breathing, and leg movements.
The Lost Continent
Although the millennia are mixed — ancient Greece with medieval
forest — Universal has done a good job creating a foreboding mood in
this section of the park.
 Dueling Dragons: Although this puppy only takes two and a half
minutes, it comes with the usual health warnings and a scream
factor of 11 on a 10-point scale. True coaster crazies love this inter-
twined set of leg-dangling racers that climb to 125 feet, invert five
times, and on three occasions come within 12 inches of each other
as the two dragons battle. The Fire Dragon can reach speeds of up
to 60 mph, while the Ice Dragon only makes it to 55 mph. This ride
has a 54-inch height minimum.
 The Eighth Voyage of Sindbad: The mythical sailor Sindbad is the
star of a stunt demonstration that takes place in a 1,700-seat theater
decorated with blue stalagmites and eerie shipwrecks. The show
Part V: Visiting Central Florida: Mickey Mania 
354

includes water explosions and pyrotechnic effects including a 
10-foot circle of flames. It doesn’t, however, come close to the Indiana
Jones stunt show at Disney–MGM Studios (described earlier in this
chapter).
 The Flying Unicorn. This small roller coaster is similar to Woody
Woodpecker’s Nuthouse Coaster at Universal Studios Florida (see
earlier in this chapter) and The Barnstormer at Goofy’s Wiseacre
Farm in the Magic Kingdom (also earlier). That means a fast,
corkscrew run sure to earn squeals but probably not superterrify-
ing. The ride travels through a mythical forest next to Dueling
Dragons. Riders must be at least 36 inches tall.
 The Mystic Fountain: This interactive “smart” fountain delights
younger guests. It can see and hear, leading to a lot of kibitzing with
those who stand before the stone fountain, suitably named “Rocky.”
If you get close enough, you may even get a surprise shower. It’s a
real treat for 3- to 8-year-olds.
 Poseidon’s Fury: This is the park’s best show. That said, it’s one of
the park’s only shows. You pass through a 42-foot vortex — where
17,500 gallons of water swirl around you, barrel style — and then
get a front-row seat in a battle royale, where Zeus and the evil
Darkenon hurl 25-foot fireballs at each other. But if the lines are
long and you’re on a tight schedule, skip it.
Children younger than 7 may find the flaming fireballs, explosive
sounds, and rushing water a little too intense.
SeaWorld
Though it’s a distant seventh (out of eight) in Orlando’s theme-park
wars, SeaWorld still manages to attract 4.7 million visitors a year by
delivering a more relaxed pace with several animal encounters. This
modern marine park focuses more on discovery than on thrill rides,
though it offers its share of excitement with Journey to Atlantis, a steep
flumelike ride, and Kraken, a floorless roller coaster.
Park prices
Single-day admission is $59.75 for adults, $48 for kids 3 to 9, plus the 
6 percent sales tax and $8 parking.
You also can buy a FlexTicket. This is the most economical way to see
the various “other-than-Disney” parks. With the FlexTicket, you pay one
price to visit any of the participating parks during a 14-day period. A
four-park pass to Universal Studios Florida, Islands of Adventure, Wet ’n’
Wild, and SeaWorld is $184.95 for adults and $150.95 for children 3 to 9.
A five-park pass, which adds Busch Gardens in Tampa, is $224.95 for
adults and $189.95 for kids.
Chapter 18: Touring the Theme Parks 355

SeaWorld attractions
SeaWorld combines wildlife-conservation awareness with laid-back fun.
Although close encounters with marine life are the major draw, you’ll
also find some excellent shows and thrill rides. Here are the highlights:
 Cirque de la Mer: Other than costumes, there’s little aquatic about
it, but a cast of acrobats, mimes, dancers, musicians, and comics
provide a show that’s at times artistic and funny (and always enter-
taining). The sets and costumes focus on Peru’s folklore and Incan
past and there’s a small amount of audience participation.
 Clyde & Seamore Take Pirate Island: A lovable sea lion–and-otter
duo, with a supporting cast of walruses and harbor seals, stars in
this fish-breathed comedy that comes with a swashbuckling con-
servation theme. The show is corny, but it’s a refreshing break from
all the high-tech rides and shows at the other theme parks.
 Intensity Games Water Ski Show: It’s hard to top this show, a
crowd-pleaser for more than 15 years. The hypercompetition stars
some of the most skilled athletes on water. The 20-person team
includes world-class skiers, wake-boarders, and stunt men and
women from across the United States performing aquabatics.
 Journey to Atlantis: Taking a cue from Disney’s Imagineers,
SeaWorld came up with a flume ride that carries the customary 
surgeon-general’s warning about heart problems, neck or back ail-
ments, pregnancy, seizures, dizziness, and claustrophobia. The
story line of this attraction involves a battle of good versus evil,
but what really matters is the drop — a wild plunge from 60 feet
with lugelike curves and a shorter drop thrown in for good meas-
ure. The ride carries a 46-inch height minimum.
 Key West at SeaWorld: A tree- and flower-lined Caribbean-esque
village, it offers island food, entertainers, and street vendors. It has
three animal habitats: Stingray Lagoon, where you get a hands-on
encounter with harmless rays; Dolphin Cove, a habitat for bot-
tlenose dolphins set up for visitor interaction; and Sea Turtle
Point, home to endangered and threatened species. Shortly after
this area opened, the dolphins loved to tease visitors by swimming
just out of arm’s reach. But they soon discovered there are advan-
tages to human interaction — namely smelt. Speaking of smelt, you
can buy them to feed the dolphins, and it’s real easy to spend a
bundle to reward the dolphins’ begging.
 Key West Dolphin Fest: At the partially covered, open-air Whale
and Dolphin Stadium, Atlantic bottlenose dolphins perform flips
and high jumps, swim at high speeds, do the backstroke, and give
rides to trainers. Some false killer whales (Pseudocra crassidens)
also make an appearance, accompanied by calypso music. The
tricks are impressive, but if you’ve seen a traditional tourist-park
dolphin show, you already know the plot.
Part V: Visiting Central Florida: Mickey Mania 
356

 Kraken: SeaWorld’s deepest venture into thrill rides is named for a
massive, mythological, underwater beast kept caged by Poseidon.
This 21st-century version involves floorless, open-sided 32-passenger
coasters that plant you on a pedestal high above the track. When
the monster breaks loose, you climb 151 feet, fall 144 feet, reach 
65 mph, go underground three times (spraying bystanders with
water, and make seven loops over a 4,177-foot course. It may be the
longest 3 minutes, 39 seconds of your life. This ride has a 54-inch
height minimum.
 Manatees: The Last Generation? This exhibit is as close as most
people get to the endangered West Indian manatees. Underwater
viewing stations, innovative cinema techniques, and interactive dis-
plays combine for a tribute to these gentle marine mammals.
 Marine Mammal Keeper Experience: Expect to invest a sizable
chunk of your day and budget in this eight-hour program (it runs
from 6:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., so you’ll also need to be an early riser).
You get to work side by side with a trainer, preparing meals and
feeding the animals, learning basic training techniques, and sharing
lunch. It costs $389, which also includes seven days of consecutive
admission to SeaWorld, lunch, a souvenir photo, and a T-shirt. The
program is limited to two people per day, so make the required
reservations very early. You must be 13 or older, at least 52 inches
tall, able to climb, and able to lift and carry 15 pounds of vittles.
Call % 407-432-1178 for more information.
 Penguin Encounter: The Penguin Encounter transports you, via a
moving sidewalk, through Tuxedoville. The stars of the show are on
the other side of a Plexiglas shield. You get a glimpse of them as
they preen, socialize, and swim at bullet speeds in a 22-degree habi-
tat. You can also see puffins and murres in a similar area.
 Pets Ahoy! Eighteen cats, 12 dogs, three pot-bellied pigs, and a horse
are joined by birds and rats to perform comic relief in a 25-minute
show held several times a day. Almost all the stars were rescued
from animal shelters.
 The Shamu Adventure: Everyone comes to SeaWorld to see the big
guy, and he and his friends really dive into their work! Extremely well
choreographed, the show is carried out by very good trainers and
very smart orcas. The fun builds until the video monitor flashes an
urgent “Weather Watch” and one of the trainers utters the warning:
“Uh-oh!” Hurricane Shamu is about to make landfall. At this point,
many folks remember the splash-area warnings, posted throughout
the grandstand. Those who didn’t pay attention when they arrived
get one last chance to flee. The orcas then race around the edge of
the pool, creating huge waves of icy water that profoundly soak
everything in range.
 Shamu’s Happy Harbor: This 3-acre play area has a four-story tower
with a 35-foot crow’s-nest lookout, water cannons, remote-controlled
vehicles, and a water maze. It’s one of the most extensive play areas
Chapter 18: Touring the Theme Parks 357

at any park and a great place for kids to unwind. Bring extra clothes
for the tots (or for yourself) because the Harbor isn’t designed to
keep you dry.
 Shark Encounter: This attraction is actually home to some 220
species of marine predators. Pools out front have small sharks and
rays (feeding isn’t allowed). The interior aquariums have big eels,
beautiful lionfish, hauntingly still barracudas, and the fat, bug-eyed
pufferfish.
This tour isn’t for the claustrophobic: You walk through a Plexiglas
tube beneath hundreds of millions of gallons of water. Also, small
children may find the sharks too much to handle.
 Whale Encounter: This program allows four guests per day to get in
the water with false killer whales, which are a cousin of Atlantic bot-
tlenose dolphins but at 1,300 pounds are up to two or three times
their size. The $200, two-hour encounter includes 30 minutes in
waist-deep water with one of the park’s four critters, lunch, a T-shirt,
souvenir photo, and one week’s admission to SeaWorld. Note: This
experience lets you touch but not swim with pseudorcas. It has a 
52-inch minimum height requirement. Call % 407-370-1382 for details.
 Wild Arctic: Wild Arctic combines a high-definition adventure film
with flight-simulator technology to evoke breathtaking Arctic
panoramas. After a hazardous flight over the frozen north, visitors
emerge at a series of interior aquariums that are the homes of polar
bears, seals, walruses, and white beluga whales. Kids may find the
bumpy ride a little much, but there’s a separate line for those who
want to skip the thrill-ride section.
Discovery Cove
SeaWorld’s second theme park opened in summer 2000. Its $100-million
construction cost is one-tenth the sticker price of Universal’s Islands of
Adventure (earlier in this chapter), but Discovery Cove’s admission
price is more than four times higher. You have two options: $229 to $259
per person plus 6 percent sales tax if you want to swim with a dolphin
(minimum age 6), or $129 to $159 if you can skip that luxury.
Discovery Cove provides plenty of elbow room — there’s a limit of
1,000 guests per day. The all-inclusive nature of the park means that
prices include almost everything you’ll need, from lunch (with choices
such as fajitas, salmon, and pesto chicken), to your towel and locker,
to swimming/snorkeling gear, and your activities. The fun includes: 
 Swimming near (but on the other side of Plexiglas from) black-tip
sharks and barracudas.
 Snorkeling around a huge pool containing a coral reef with brightly
colored tropical fish and another area with gentle rays.
Part V: Visiting Central Florida: Mickey Mania 
358

 Feeding 300 exotic birds in an aviary hidden under a waterfall.
 Cooling off under foaming waterfalls.
 Soaking up the sun on the beaches.
 Enjoying the park’s pools and rivers (freshwater and saltwater).
 Seven days of unlimited admission to SeaWorld.
To get to Discovery Cove, follow the directions to SeaWorld, earlier in
this chapter. For up-to-the-minute information on this park, call % 877-
434-7268 or go to www.discoverycove.com.

n addition to the eight major parks I listed in Chapter 18, a ton of
other attractions will help you take a break from the Mouse ears.
These are places where you can spend two to six hours but, in most
cases, not a small fortune at the ticket window. Considering Disney’s
corner on the Orlando market, it’s not surprising that many of the most
popular small attractions in town are at WDW. If, however, you prefer to
leave Walt’s wonderland for something a little more peaceful, intellec-
tual, or cultural, numerous attractions that are far from Mickey-Mouse
operations await you.
Seeing the Top Smaller Attractions
I start with the Disney attractions and then get into some of the other
things that you can do in less than a day in and around O Town.
The never-ending world of Disney
Destination Disney never seems to run out of things to do. It’s really a
well-planned plot to corner more of your dough, instead of having to
share it with others. To the tune of “When You Wish Upon a Star,” I offer
the next level.

Blizzard Beach
Near Disney–MGM Studios
Blizzard Beach is a 66-acre “ski resort” situated in the midst of a tropical
lagoon (there’s also some faux snow). Attractions include Cross Country
Creek, a 2,900-foot tube ride around the park; Ski-Patrol Training Camp, a
preteen area with a rope swing and slides; Meltaway Bay, a 1-acre, rela-
tively calm wave pool; and Teamboat Springs, Walt Disney World’s longest
white-water raft ride (1,200 feet of rushing waterfalls).
But the headliner is Summit Plummet. Read every speed, motion, vertical-
dip, wedgie, and hold-onto-your-breastplate warning, and then — as a warm-
up — test your bravado in a bullring, a space shuttle, or any other
death-defying hobby. This puppy starts pretty slow, with a ski-lift ride (even
in Florida’s 100-degree dog days) to the 120-foot summit, where you board
the world’s fastest body slide. Can you say natural enema? You can easily
spend the day in this park.
See map p. 319. On World Drive. % 407-560-3400. www.disneyworld.com. To get
there: Located just north of the All-Star Sports and Music resorts. Admission: $34
adults, $28 kids 3–9. Open: Daily 10 a.m–5 p.m., extended to 9 a.m.–8 p.m. during peak
times, such as summer.
DisneyQuest
Downtown Disney West Side
Meet the world’s most interactive video arcade, with everything from vir-
tual rides to old-fashioned pinball with a new-fangled twist. Here are the
best:
 Aladdin’s Magic Carpet Ride puts you astride a motorcycle-like
seat while you fly through the 3-D Cave of Wonders.
 If you have an inventive mind (and a steel stomach), stop in at
Cyberspace Mountain, where Bill Nye the Science-Turned-Roller-
Coaster Guy helps you create the ultimate loop-and-dipster, which
you then can ride in a very real-feeling simulator. It’s a major hit
with the coaster-crazy crowd. (I know some adrenaline junkies who
spent hours here constructing, then riding, one heart-stopper after
another.) Bring your own motion-sickness medicine (though you
can choose slow, medium, or quick death).
 Invasion: An ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter takes you on
an intense mission to save colonists from intergalactic bad guys.
One player flies the module while up to three others fire an array of
weapons. (Just try to work all in sync — after a minute it’s a free-
for-all shooting fest.) This was an offshoot of the now-defunct
Magic Kingdom attraction, but there’s not much of a connection
other than the preshow video.
 Mighty Ducks Pinball Slam is an interactive, life-size game in which
the players ride platforms and use body English to score points.
Chapter 19: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 361

 Pirates of the Caribbean: Battle for Buccaneer Gold outfits you
and up to three mates in 3-D helmets so you can battle pirate ships
virtual-reality style. One of you volunteers to be the captain, steer-
ing the ship, while the others assume positions behind cannons to
blast the black hearts into oblivion — maybe. Each time you do,
you’re rewarded with some doubloons, but beware of sea monsters
that can gobble you and your treasure.
 Animation Academy provides some quiet time for those who need
it, by way of a minicourse in Disney cartooning.
There are also snack and food areas. A typical theme-park meal and drink
at the food areas runs about $12 per person. There’s no specific children’s
menu, but the servings are plentiful and can easily be enough for two.
Note: Crowds are heaviest here after dark.
See map p. 319. Off of Buena Vista Dr. % 407-828-4600. www.disneyworld.com.
To get there: Located adjacent to Pleasure Island and Downtown Disney. Admission:
$34 adults, $28 kids 3–9 for unlimited play. Open: Daily 11:30 a.m.–11 p.m. (until mid-
night Fri–Sat).
Disney’s Wide World of Sports
South of Disney–MGM Studios
This 200-acre complex has several baseball and softball fields, 6 basket-
ball courts, 12 lighted tennis courts, a golf driving range, and 6 sand vol-
leyball courts. The Multi-Sports Experience challenges guests with a
variety of activities, covering many sports: football, baseball, basketball,
hockey, soccer and volleyball. It’s open on select days. Depending on your
stamina, interest, and the size of the crowds, the experience can last 45
minutes to several hours.
See map p. 319. South Victory Way, just north of U.S. 192. % 407-828-3267. www.

Admission: Prices vary by venue; general admission including the Multi-Sports
Experience is $10 adults, $7.50 kids 3–9. Open: Daily, but hours vary by venue.
Richard Petty Driving Experience
Walt Disney World Speedway
This is your chance to race in a 600-horsepower NASCAR Winston-Cup
racecar. How real is it? You must sign a two-page waiver with words like
DANGEROUS and UPDATE YOUR WILL before getting into a car. At one end
of the spectrum, you can ride shotgun for two laps at 145 mph ($90). At the
other end, you can spend anywhere from three hours to two days learning
how to drive the car yourself and racing other daredevils for 8 to 30 laps
of excitement (for a cool $403–$1,330). You must be 18 years old to ride in
the car.

237-3889. To get there: Take I-4 to the Epcot Center Drive exit and head west to World
Drive. Make a right onto the Osceola Parkway and follow it 5 miles to the speedway.
Adults only. Open: Varies by seasons and hours, so call ahead.
Typhoon Lagoon
Near Downtown Disney
The fantasy setting for this water park is a storm-ravaged tropical island
strewn with tin-roofed structures, surfboards, and other wreckage left by
a typhoon. Headline attractions include Castaway Creek, a 2,100-foot raft
and tube venue; Ketchakiddie Creek, an area for the under-4-foot set;
Shark Reef, where you can snorkel with fish that live on a simulated coral
reef; Typhoon Lagoon, the signature wave pool that offers waves every 90
seconds; and Humunga Kowabunga, a snaking water-slide area. You can
spend all day here.
The creative minds at Disney have added a way for you to learn how to
catch a wave and “hang ten” at the Typhoon Lagoon water park. Tuesdays
and Fridays, instructors from Carroll’s Cocoa Beach Surfing School show
up for an early-bird session in the namesake lagoon, which has a wave
machine capable of 8-footers. The two-and-a-half-hour session is held before
the park opens to the general public. It’s limited to 14 people. Minimum age
is 8. The $125 cost doesn’t include park admission, which you have to pay
if you want to hang around after the lesson (% 407-939-7529).
See map p. 319. 1195 East Buena Vista Dr. % 407-560-4141. www.disneyworld.
com. To get there: It’s west of Downtown Disney and south of Lake Buena Vista Drive,
between the Disney Village Marketplace and Disney–MGM Studios. Admission: $34
adults, $28 kids 3–9. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m., extended to 9 a.m.–8 p.m. during peak
periods.
Beyond Disney
Believe it or not, some folks escape the theme parks and Disney. (Skip
ahead to see the “More Orlando Attractions” map.) Here are a few of the
options.
Flying Tigers Warbird Restoration Museum
Kissimmee
Tom Reilly, the founder and owner of this museum, restores vintage war-
planes from World War II through Vietnam. His guided tours go through

eyes. The outdoor showroom has a Corsair, MIG-21, P-38 Lightning, and
three dozen others planes. Allow two to four hours to see the museum.
See map p. 364. 231 N. Hoagland Blvd., south of U.S. 192. % 407-933-1942. www.

Gatorland
South Orlando
Founded in 1949 with a handful of alligators living in huts and pens,
Gatorland today features thousands of alligators and crocodiles on 70
acres. Breeding pens, nurseries, and rearing ponds are scattered through-
out the park, which also displays monkeys, snakes, birds, Florida turtles,
and a Galápagos tortoise. There are three shows — Gator Wrestlin’, which
is more of an environmental awareness program; the Gator Jumparoo, in
which one of the big reptiles lunges 4 or 5 feet out of the water to snatch
a long-dead chicken from a trainer’s hand; and Jungle Crocs of the World,
which showcases the toothy reptiles. The park has an open-air restaurant
where you can feast on smoked gator ribs and nuggets. Younger guests
enjoy the park’s water play area, train ride, and petting zoo with baby
llamas and goats. Allow four to five hours to see everything, a full day if
you add an adventure tour (see the following paragraph).
Gatorland offers several Adventure Tour programs ($38–$190). Options
include being a trainer for a day (you actually get to wrestle an alligator),
day and night airboat rides, sea turtle watches, and alligator-egg-collecting
expeditions (a seasonal option, generally in mid- to late spring).
See map p. 364. 14501 S. Orange Blossom Trail/U.S. 441 (between Osceola Parkway
and Hunter’s Creek Boulevard, Orlando). % 800-393-5297 or 407-855-5496. www.
gatorland.com. Admission: $19.95 adults, $9.95 kids 3–12. Free parking. Open:
Daily 9 a.m.–6 p.m., sometimes later.
Orlando Science Center
North of Orlando
This four-story center has ten halls that allow visitors to explore every-
thing from the swamps of Florida to the arid plains of Mars. The Dr.
Phillips CineDome is a 310-seat theater that uses the latest technology to
present large-format films as well as planetarium and laser shows. In
KidsTown, little folks wander in a miniature version of the world around
them. One section has a pint-sized community that includes a construc-
tion site, park, and wellness center. Science City, located nearby, has a
power plant, suspension bridge, and the Inventor’s Workshop, a garage-
like station for creative play. Children stopping by 123 Math Avenue work
on puzzles and play with math-based toys that teach as they entertain.
Plan to spend three to four hours.

Water Mania
Kissimmee
This 36-acre water park isn’t on a Disney scale, but it offers a variety of
aquatic thrill rides and attractions. You can boogie board or body surf in
continuous-wave pools, float lazily along an 850-foot river, enjoy a white-
water tubing adventure, and plummet down spiraling water slides and
steep flumes. Plan on about four hours.
See map p. 364. 6073 W. Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy./U.S. 192. % 800-527-3092 or
407-396-2626. www.watermania-florida.com. To get there: Take the I-4 U.S. 192
exit west 2 miles; turn left on Old Lake Wilson Road/Highway 545; the park is 1 mile
ahead on left. Admission: $24 adults, $20 kids 3–9. Parking: $6. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Mar–Sept.
Wet ’n Wild
International Drive
Unlike Water Mania (see the preceding listing), this 25-acre Universal-
owned water park is in the same league as Disney’s Typhoon Lagoon and
Blizzard Beach (see Chapter 18). It has several first-rate water rides,
including Fuji Flyer, a six-story, four-passenger toboggan ride packing 450
feet of banked curves; The Surge, which offers 580 feet of slippery curves
and is billed as the fastest tube ride in the Southeast; and Black Hole,
where two-person rafts shoot through 500 feet of twisting, sometimes dark
passages. All three require that kids 36 to 48 inches have an adult with them.
Raging Rapids is a simulated white-water run with a waterfall plunge; Blue
Niagra has 300 feet of loops and dips (48-inch height minimum); Knee Ski
is a cable-operated knee-boarding course only open in warm weather 
(56-inch height minimum); and Mach 5 has a trio of twisting, turning flumes.
The park also has a large kids’ area with miniature versions of some of the
grown-up rides.
See map p. 364. 6200 International Dr., at Universal Blvd. % 800-992-9453 or 407-
351-9453. www.wetnwild.com. To get there: Take I-4 east to Exit 75A and follow
the signs. Parking: Cars $5, RVs $6. Admission: $33 adults, $27 kids 3–9, $14.48 sen-
iors 55 and older. Tube, towel, and locker rentals are $9 plus a $2 refundable deposit.
A 14-day Flexticket — good for admission to Wet ’n’ Wild, Universal Studios Florida,
Islands of Adventure, and SeaWorld — is available for $214.95 for adults, $179.95 for
kids 3–9. Open: Daily, but hours vary seasonally; call before you go.
More Cool Things to See and Do
Now, I get into things that have more of a special-interest flavor. (And,
this is another area where you’ll discover I was stretching the truth a
wee bit when I suggested you were escaping Disney.)
 Baseball: The Atlanta Braves play 18 spring-training games at the
Disney Wide World of Sports stadium during a one-month season
that begins in early March. (Workouts begin in mid-February.)
Part V: Visiting Central Florida: Mickey Mania 
366

Game tickets for the stadium’s two seating areas are $11.50 and
$19.50. For information, call % 407-828-3267. You can order tickets
through Ticketmaster at % 407-839-3900 or online at www.atlanta
braves.com.
 Golf: The Magic Mickey has five 18-hole, par-72 golf courses and one
9-hole, par-36 walking course. All have pro shops, equipment rentals,
and instruction. Rates range from $105 to $170 per 18-hole round for
resort guests; the fee is $5 more if you’re not staying at a Walt Disney
World property. For tee times and information, call % 407-824-2270
up to seven days in advance (up to 30 days in advance for Disney-
resort and official-property guests). Call % 407-934-7639 for infor-
mation about golf packages.
If you want more golfing options, or want to get out of Disney for a bit,
three excellent sources of information and tee-time reservations are
Golfpac (% 888-848-8941 or 407-260-2288; www.golfpacinc.com),
Florida Golfing (% 866-833-2663; www.floridagolfing.com), and
Tee Times USA (% 888-465-3356; www.teetimesusa.com).
 Miniature golf: Normally, I wouldn’t list this category, but Diz
makes it something special. Winter Summerland, off Buena Vista
Drive, north of Osceola Parkway (% 407-560-3000; $10 adults, $8
kids 3–9), and Fantasia Gardens, Buena Vista, east of World Drive
(% 407-560-8760; $9.76 adults, $7.78 kids 3–9) each have two 
18-hole, ton-of-fun courses.
Shopping
Orlando is far from paradise for shoppers, but it has a fair number of
places where you can wear out your credit card.
Orlando’s best shopping areas
Orlando doesn’t have a central shopping district. Instead, it has tourist
areas that are best avoided unless you want cheap goods at high prices,
as well as neighborhood retail locations, such as malls, where locals
shop. The following is a list of some of the more frequented shopping
zones:
 Celebration: Think Pleasantville with a Mickey touch. This Disney-
created town of 5,000 is more of a diversion than a shopper’s para-
dise. The downtown area has a dozen pricey shops and galleries.
The shops offer some interesting buys for those with deep pock-
ets, but the real plus is the Pleasantville atmosphere. To get to
Celebration from Disney, take U.S. 192 east 5 miles, a little beyond
Interstate 4. The entrance is on the right (% 407-566-2200).
 Downtown Disney Marketplace: This Size XXXL shopping hub on
Buena Vista Lagoon is a colorful place to browse, people watch,
have lunch, and maybe buy a trinket. Stores include the Lego
Chapter 19: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 367

Imagination Center, where kids can play in a free Lego-building
area outside while their parents browse inside; EUROSPAIN, which
sells products that crystal and metal artists make before your eyes;
and the Art of Disney, a store that can dent your bank account if
you crave original Disney art (www.disneyworld.com).
 Downtown Disney West Side: This venue on Buena Vista Drive has
many specialty stores where you can find unique gifts and souvenirs.
Guitar Gallery tempts string-strokers and wannabes with custom
jobs and rare collectibles, and Sosa Family Cigars beckons with a
tradition reaching back to yesterday’s Cuba. The Virgin Megastore is
a movie, music, and multimedia gold mine (www.disneyworld.com).
 Behind-the-Scenes Disney: Held six times a year, WDW’s backlot
auctions feature a lot of castoff and surplus merchandise, from
theme-park props to pots and pans to over-the-hill maintenance
equipment, such as lawn mowers. They’re always held on a
Thursday, when Disney workers get paid. Call % 407-824-6878 for
dates, directions, and information. For bigger trinkets, check out
Disney auctions on eBay (www.disneyauctions.com).
 Kissimmee: Southeast of the Disney parks, Kissimmee straddles
U.S. 192/Irlo Bronson Memorial Highway — a sometimes tacky strip
lined with budget motels, smaller attractions, and every fast-food
restaurant known to the Western world. Kissimmee’s shopping
merit is negligible unless you’re looking for a cheap T-shirt or a
white elephant gift. (Seashells, anyone?)
 International Drive: This tourist magnet extends 7 to 10 miles
north of the Disney parks between Highway 535 and the Florida
Turnpike. The southern end has a little elbowroom, but the north-
ern part is a tourist strip crowded with small-time attractions
(there’s bungee jumping for those who have a death wish), fast
fooderies, and souvenir shacks. The main shopping draw is Pointe
Orlando, which is listed later in this chapter under “Malls.”
 Winter Park: Just north of downtown Orlando, Winter Park began
life as a haven for Yankees escaping from the cold. Today, Winter
Park’s centerpiece is Park Avenue, a collection of upscale shops,
restaurants, and art galleries along a cobblestone street. For more
information on Winter Park, call % 407-644-8281.
Searching for shopping hot spots
Orlando has the usual collection of outlets and malls. Except for Disney,
Universal, and SeaWorld souvenirs, though, it has few products of its own.
Factory outlets
In the last decade, the tourist areas in Orlando have bloomed with
places where shoppers can find name-brand bargains — maybe. Smart
shoppers always know suggested-retail prices before going to outlet
stores, so they can tell what is — and isn’t — a bargain.
Part V: Visiting Central Florida: Mickey Mania 
368

 Belz Factory Outlet World, 5401 W. Oak Ridge Rd., at the north end
of International Dr. (% 407-354-0126; www.belz.com), is the grand-
daddy of all Orlando outlets. It has 180 stores, including 18 shoe
stores (Bass, Nike, and Rockport), 14 housewares stores (Fitz &
Floyd, Corning, Oneida, and Mikasa), and more than 60 clothing
shops (London Fog, Guess Jeans, Harvé Benard, Calvin Klein, and
Anne Klein). You can also buy books, toys, electronics, sporting
goods, jewelry, and so on.
 Orlando Premium Outlets, 8200 Vineland Ave., just off the south-
ern third of I-Drive (% 407-238-7787; www.premiumoutlets.com)
bills itself as Orlando’s only upscale outlet. The 110 tenants include
Coach, Polo/Ralph Lauren, and Tommy Hilfiger. Some of the best
buys here are at Banana Republic, where many items are half the
price of those at other BR stores.
Malls
The Orlando area has several traditional shopping malls. Like tenants in
malls everywhere, these merchants pay a hefty rent, so good buys are
elusive. Arguably, the best bargain is the people watching, which is free.
 Mall at Millenia (www.mallatmillenia.com), is a 1.3-million-
square-foot shoppers’ paradise in the sprawling Millenia development
near Universal Orlando (at Conroy Road and I-4). Its anchors are
Bloomingdale’s, Macy’s, and Neiman Marcus, and it has 200 specialty
stores, including Tiffany & Co., Gucci, Cartier, and Louis Vuitton.
 Florida Mall (% 407-851-6255; www.shopsimon.com) offers Lord &
Taylor, Dillard’s, Saks, Macy’s, JCPenney, Sears, an Adam’s Mark
Hotel, and more than 200 specialty stores, restaurants, and enter-
tainment venues. It’s located at 8001 S. Orange Blossom Trail at
Sand Lake Road, 4 miles east of International Drive.
 Although Pointe Orlando is set up like a mall, this complex’s two
levels of stores, restaurants, and a 21-screen IMAX theater aren’t
under one roof. It’s currently undergoing renovations that will 
add more retail shops to its current collection of 80 stores. Pointe
Orlando is located at 9101 International Dr. (% 407-248-2838;
www.pointeorlandofl.com).
Living It Up After Dark
If you have the energy to go out after a day in the theme parks, Orlando
has plenty for you to do when the sun goes down.
Disney after dark
A few years back, the Disney folks — never the type to pass up a new
opportunity to rake in some bucks — built several haunts where night
owls can dance, drink, and play to their hearts’ content. In general,
Chapter 19: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 369

Disney’s venues are far more family-friendly than Orlando’s other
evening entertainment zones, but keep in mind that distinction is rela-
tive; even some of Disney’s clubs lock out the under-21 crowd.
Pleasure Island
This 6-acre, sometimes gated, entertainment district is the home of sev-
eral nightspots. Admission to the island is free from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Admission is $19.95 from 7 p.m. to 2 a.m., when the clubs are open. The
Pleasure Island admission is included if you have a Park Hopper Plus or
Ultimate Park Hopper ticket (see Chapter 18 for information on Disney
admission passes). Self-parking is free. For complete information on all
the Pleasure Island clubs, including entertainment schedules, call the
Downtown Disney Tonite! hotline at % 407-939-2648, or check out
Disney’s Web site at www.disneyworld.com. Here’s a list of the best that
Pleasure Island has to offer:
 Mannequins Dance Palace, a high-energy club with a big, rotating
dance floor, is the main event on Pleasure Island. Because it’s a
local favorite, it’s hard to get into, so arrive early, especially on
weekends. Three levels of bars and mixing space are adorned with
elaborately dressed mannequins. The DJ plays contemporary tunes
loud enough to wake the dead. You must be 21 to enter.
 The Adventurers Club almost defies description — it needs to be
experienced. According to Walt Disney World legend, it was
designed to be the library and archaeological trophy room for
Pleasure Island founder and explorer, Merriweather Adam Pleasure.
Pleasure’s zany band of globetrotting friends and servants, played
by skilled actors, interact with guests, while staying in character.
Improvisational comedy and cabaret shows are performed in the
library. You can easily hang out here all night.
 If you’re a fan of the BET Cable Network, you’ll probably love BET
Soundstage (% 407-934-7666), which offers traditional R&B and
the rhyme of hip-hop. You can dance on an expansive floor or kick
back on an outdoor terrace. Cover charge for the Soundstage is
included in the Pleasure Island pass except for major concerts.
 The Who, What, and Warehouse Players are the main event at the
Comedy Warehouse. The group performs 45-minute improvisa-
tional shows based on audience suggestions. They do five shows a
night.
 Disco and polyester rule at 8Trax, a 1970s-style club where 50 TV
screens air diverse shows and videos over the dance floor. A DJ
plays everything from “YMCA” to “The Hustle.”
 Motion features Top-40 tunes and alternative rock. It’s a hyperac-
tive club that appeals to younger and young-at-heart partiers.
Moody blue lighting helps you pretend you’re dancing the night
away in deep space.
Part V: Visiting Central Florida: Mickey Mania 
370

Disney West Side
Immediately adjacent to Pleasure Island, Disney West Side is a slightly
newer district, where you’ll find clubs, restaurants, and DisneyQuest
(see earlier in this chapter).
 Singer Gloria Estefan and her husband, Emilio, created Bongo’s
Cuban Café (% 407-828-0999; www.bongoscubancafe.com),
which serves up loud salsa music and second-rate Cuban fare.
Come for the Latino atmosphere, rather than the food (which will
run you $10–$26). The Café is open daily from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. and
doesn’t take reservations. You can find plenty of free self-parking.
 Cirque du Soleil doesn’t have any lions, tigers, or bears; but you
won’t feel cheated. The “Circus of the Sun’s” 64 performers deliver
nonstop energy on trampolines, the trapeze, and a high wire in a
five-star show called La Nouba. The two ticket categories are $85
for adults and $59 for kids 3 to 9 (plus tax) for center-of-the-theater
seats, and $73 and $49, respectively, to the right and left of the
stage. Shows are held at 6 and 9 p.m. Thursday through Monday.
For information, call % 407-939-7600, or visit its Web site at
www.cirquedusoleil.com.
 The rafters in the House of Blues literally shake with rhythm and
blues. The House is decorated with folk art, and the patio has a view
of the bay. If you like spicy food, offerings such as jambalaya and
gumbo ($9–$25) are respectable. Sunday’s Gospel Brunch ($30 for
adults and $15 for kids 3–12) has foot-stomping music served with
so-so food (omelets, beef, jalapeño smashed potatoes, cheese grits,
and sausage). Brunch is the only time you can make reservations.
Guests dining before attending a show that night are often eligible
for early admission, which is handy during the general admission
shows. Ask your server for details, call % 407-934-2583, or go to
www.hob.com. House of Blues is open daily from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m.
and offers free self-parking.
Disney’s Boardwalk
The Boardwalk (% 407-939-3492; www.disneyworld.com) is a great
place for a quiet stroll or more. Street performers sing, dance, juggle,
and make a little magic most evenings. Atlantic Dance features Top-40
and ’80s dance hits. The rustic, saloon-style Jellyrolls offers dueling
pianos ($5 cover). If you need a game fix, ESPN Sports has dozens of TV
screens, a full-service bar, food, and a small arcade, all without a cover
charge.
Universal after dark
Universal’s answer to Pleasure Island is CityWalk, a two-level collection of
clubs and restaurants located between its two theme parks (% 407-363-
8000; www.universalorlando.com). It’s open from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. daily.
There’s no admission, but several clubs have cover charges after 5 or 
6 p.m., and some aren’t open earlier than that. CityWalk offers party
Chapter 19: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 371

passes. A pass to all clubs is $9.95 per night; for $13 you can add a movie
at Universal Cineplex (% 407-354-5998). Universal also offers free club
access to those who buy certain multiday tickets. Parking is $8 before 
6 p.m., free afterwards. Here’s what you’ll find:
 Bob Marley — A Tribute to Freedom (% 407-224-2262) has archi-
tecture said to replicate Marley’s home in Kingston. Local and
national reggae bands perform, and light Jamaican fare is served
under umbrellas. Hours are 4 p.m. to 2 a.m. There’s a $5 cover after
8 p.m.; cover prices increase when there are special concerts. You
must be 21 or older to party after 10 p.m.
 The collection of memorabilia at the Downbeat Jazz Hall of Fame
at CityJazz (% 407-224-2189) ranges from Buddy Rich to Ella
Fitzgerald. The adjoining Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz is a
performance venue that’s also the site of workshops. You can
browse through 500 pieces of memorabilia marching through
Dixieland, swing, bebop, and modern jazz. Nationally acclaimed
acts sometimes perform. It’s open from 7 or 8 p.m. to 1 or 2 a.m.
daily. Cover charge is $5 (more for special events).
 the groove (% 407-363-8000) is CityWalk’s answer to Pleasure
Island’s Mannequins, though it’s not as crowded. The sound system
is guaranteed to blow your hair back, and the dance floor is in a
room gleaming with chrome. Music-wise, the groove features hip-
hop, jazz fusion, techno, and alternative music. You must be at
least 21 to enter, and it will cost you $5 for the privilege. The club is
open from 9 p.m. to 2 or 3 a.m. daily.
 CityWalk’s Hard Rock Cafe (% 407-351-5483) is the largest in the
world, and the adjoining Hard Rock Live is the first concert hall to
bear the name. There’s also a free exhibit area in the cafe, where
you can browse through displays of rock memorabilia, including the
platform heels, leather jumpsuits, and tongue-action photos of KISS.
Cover charge varies by act. The cafe is open daily from 11 a.m. to 
2 a.m.
 Canned music is piped through Jimmy Buffett’s Margaritaville
(% 407-224-2155), with a Jimmy sound-alike strumming on the
back porch. Bar-wise, you have three options. The Volcano erupts
(we’re not kidding) margaritas; the Land Shark has fins swimming
around the ceiling; and the 12 Volt, is, well, a little electrifying.
Margaritaville is open from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m., and there’s a $5 cover
after 10 p.m.
 Just like the original version in New Orleans’s French Quarter,
drinking is the highlight at Pat O’Brien’s (% 407-363-8000). You
can enjoy dueling pianos and a flame-throwing fountain while you
suck down the signature drink — the Hurricane. No one under 21 is
permitted after 7 p.m. Hours are 4 p.m. to 2 a.m., and there is a $5
cover charge after 9 p.m.
Part V: Visiting Central Florida: Mickey Mania 
372

Other nighttime venues
8 Seconds, 100 W. Livingston Ave., downtown (% 407-839-4800; www.
8-seconds.com; $5 cover for 21 and older, $7 for 18–21; open 8 p.m.–
2 a.m. Fri–Sat), is a honky-tonk with a huge dance floor where you can
get free line-dancing lessons early in the evening. If you go on Saturday,
take the side-trip to the parking lot for “Buckin’ Bull Nights,” when cow-
boys provide some extra entertainment in the ring. On Fridays, you can
find monster-truck pulls in the back lot. Country stars sometimes per-
form outside the ring.
Howl at the Moon Saloon, 55 W. Church St., downtown (% 407-841-9118;
www.howlatthemoon.com; $2–$4 cover; open daily 6 p.m.–2 a.m.), is a fun
bar, and the fun hits its peak on a full moon — even if you’re too shy to
cock your head back and hooowlllll with the best of them. Sak Comedy
Lab, 380 W. Amelia St., downtown (% 407-648-0001; www.sak.com; $5–$12
admission; shows are usually at 8 and 10 p.m., plus midnight on Sat), is a
200-seat club where locals perform in eight to ten shows weekly (usually
Tues and Thurs–Sat). Favorites include Duel of Fools, where two teams
face off in improvised scenes based on suggestions from the audience,
and Lab Rats, where students play in improv formats.
Side-tripping to John F. Kennedy Space Center
Explore the history of manned flights at Kennedy Space Center (% 321-
449-4444; www.kennedyspacecenter.com), beginning with the wild ride
of Alan Shepard (1961) and Neil Armstrong’s 1969 moonwalk. The center
has dual five-and-a-half-story, 3-D Imax theaters that reverberate with
special effects. The shows are L5: First City in Space, a fictional look at a
space colony; and The Dream Is Alive, a rousing past-and-present focus
on the Space Shuttle program. The Visitor Complex has real NASA rock-
ets and exhibits that look at plans for space exploration well into this
millennium. There are also hands-on activities for kids, a chance to meet
a real astronaut, several dining venues, and a shop selling a variety of
space memorabilia and souvenirs.
Bus tours (rent the audio tape for $5) run continuously. You can get off
at the Vehicle Assembly Building, where shuttles are prepared for
launch; the LC-39 Observation Gantry, which has a 360-degree view of
shuttle launch pads; and the Apollo/Saturn V Center, which includes arti-
facts, photos, interactive exhibits, and a 363-foot-tall Saturn V rocket.
Note: The last bus tour usually departs about two hours before closing
time. Call for schedules.
This is an all-day attraction. To get to the Kennedy Space Center from
Orlando, take the BeeLine Expressway east to Highway 407, turn left, and
then turn right at Highway 405. Directions to the center are well marked
along the roadside. The Space Center is located at NASA Parkway/
Chapter 19: Exploring the Rest of Orlando 373

Highway 405, 6 miles east of Titusville, about a half mile west of Highway 3.
Admission is $26 adults, $16 kids 3 to 11, and the center is open from 
9 a.m. to dusk daily.
On launch days, the center is closed at least part of the day. These aren’t
good days to see the center, but they’re great days to observe history in
the making. For $15 per person ($36.50 adults and $26.50 kids if you
decide to buy center admission, too), you can go on at least a two-hour
excursion to NASA Parkway to see the liftoff. You must pick up tickets,
available five days prior to the launch, on-site.
If you’re staying in Orlando and don’t have a car, you can arrange a trip
to the center through Mears Transportation by calling % 407-423-5566.
From WDW, it’s $19 per person round-trip (kids under 4 are free).
Shuttles run only on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Mears does not
run buses on launch days.
Side-tripping to Cypress Gardens
FDR was in his first term when this foundation theme park opened in
1936. After a brief closure several years ago, the park reopened in 2004,
adding a plethora of new rides to its already famous gardens and shows.
The 200-acre attraction continues to showcase 8,000 kinds of plants,
ancient cypress trees, ponds, lagoons, waterfalls, classic Italian foun-
tains, bronze sculptures, and manicured lawns. Southern belles still
stroll the manicured grounds or sit on benches under parasols in idyllic
tree-shaded nooks. In late winter and early spring, more than 20 kinds of
bougainvilleas, 40 types of azaleas, and hundreds of varieties of roses
burst into bloom. Crape myrtles, magnolias, and gardenias perfume the
air, while hibiscuses and jasmines brighten the summer landscape.
But years of transformation have turned Cypress Gardens into a less
passive, more-than-just-visual park. Kids love the Boardwalk Carousel,
an ornate turn-of-the-20th-century-style carousel. The adjoining Jubilee
Junction features an elaborately landscaped model railroad that travels
1,100 feet of track with up to 20 trains, visiting miniature landmarks
including New Orleans and Mount Rushmore. Electric boats navigate a
maze of canals in the botanical gardens area. In order to compete with
the thrills available at other Orlando parks, Cypress Gardens has installed
a number of roller coasters, including the 5-story-high Inverter, the
wooden Triple Hurricane, and the 80-miles-an-hour Pharaoh’s Fury.
Splash Island Park (open late spring through summer) lets kids cool off
in a pint-size pool, and everyone get a rush on the six flumes. For a water-
based thrill, brave the 60-foot-drop on the park’s Storm Surge or tackle
the twists and turns of the Wave Runner. Nature’s Way features ring-
tailed lemurs, colorful macaws, Nile crocodiles, wallabies, and a jaguar.
Part V: Visiting Central Florida: Mickey Mania 
374

On the water, Cypress Gardens’s celebrated skiers (called the Top Fun
Ski Academy) keep a legendary tradition going with standards such as
ramp jumping, the aqua-maid ballet line, the human pyramid, and the
flag line — all with a little slapstick thrown in for good measure. Shows
change periodically. There’s some frozen water, too: Cypress Gardens on
Ice is an ice-skating show starring world-class performers.
Wings of Wonder is a conservatory with more than 1,000 brilliant but-
terflies (50 species) in a Victorian-style, climate-controlled, free-flight
aviary. This man-made rain forest features lush foliage, miniwaterfalls,
and iguanas. There’s also a hatching display that shows the various
stages of butterfly metamorphosis.
The Birdwalk Aviary has 40 to 50 hand-raised lories and lorikeets that
welcome you by landing on your shoulders. The young Australian par-
rots are brilliantly colored and very inquisitive. They share the sanctu-
ary with pheasants, ducks, and muntjacs (the smallest deer species in
the world).
Cypress Gardens is located at 2641 S. Lake Summit Dr., Highway 540 at
Cypress Gardens Boulevard, 40 miles southwest of Disney World, Winter
Haven (% 800-282-2123; www.cypressgardens.com). It’s open from
9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily, sometimes later. Admission is $34.95 for adults,
$29.95 for children 6 to 9. Parking costs $7.

Newspapers
You can find a lot of bargains in the major
daily, the Orlando Sentinel (www.orlando
sentinel.com) throughout the week.
The paper’s Friday “Calendar” section is a
gold mine for current information about
the area’s accommodations, restaurants,
nightclubs, and attractions.

Safety
Don’t let the aura of Mickey Mouse allow
you to lower your guard. Orlando has a
crime rate that’s comparable to other
major U.S. cities. Stay alert and remain
aware of your immediate surroundings.
Renting a locker is always preferable to
leaving your valuables in the trunk of your
car, even in the theme-park lots. Be cau-
tious and avoid carrying large amounts 
of cash.
Taxes
Expect to add 11 or 12 percent to room
rates and 6 to 7 percent on most everything
else — except groceries and medicines.
Taxis
Yellow Cab (% 407-699-9999) and Ace
Metro (% 407-855-0564) are among those
cabs serving the area. Rates are $2.50 for
the first mile and $1.50 per mile thereafter.
Transit Info
Lynx (% 407-841-2279; www.golynx.
com) bus stops are marked with a paw
print. The buses serve Disney, Universal,
and International Drive ($1.25 for adults, 
50¢ for kids and seniors; $10 for an unlim-
ited weekly pass), but they’re not very
tourist-oriented.
Weather
Call % 321-255-0212 to get forecasts from
the National Weather Service. When the
phone picks up, punch in 412 from a Touch-
Tone phone, and you’ll get the Orlando
forecast. Also check with The Weather
Channel if you have cable television or go

o Miami Vice. No Orlando Mice.
And in spite of that, Florida’s top half has plenty to keep you
busy. I start you off at Daytona Beach, which is the closest
this region gets to glitzy tourism, and you can ﬁnd plenty of 
it there. Even historic St. Augustine sports a tourist-trap
atmosphere — if you buy that Fountain of Youth hype, I’ve
got a bridge to sell you. But I help you look past the bottled
Fountain of Youth Water to ﬁnd some serious Euro-style old
world charm. Up in Jacksonville I tell you about a city on the
move — especially after hosting the Super Bowl. Finally, I 
take you off the metro-path, to Fernandina Beach and Amelia
Island — two of Florida’s most sublime stunners. With the
exception of such vacation hot spots as Panama City, Destin,
and Fort Walton Beach (not reviewed in this book for reasons
of space), this part of Florida is wide-open territory, showcas-
ing dune-lined beaches and vast pine forests.

L
ocal tourism types call it the “World’s Most Famous Beach.” That’s a
much disputed claim, of course, but Daytona does court tens of
thousands of snowbirds in winter, families in summer, college kids
during spring break, and bikers during Bike Week and Biketoberfest — a
series of races, parties, and games (mainly of the drinking variety). They
are all wooed by sun, sand, surf, and the chance to drive on the beach.
(What they don’t tell you are the side effects of beach driving: auto-
pedestrian run-ins, carbon monoxide highs, 10 mph traffic jams, and
paint and body corrosion when you park too close to the surf and take a
nap on an incoming tide.) 
For some travelers, especially older ones or those seeking a quieter, less
glitzy beach experience, Daytona Beach is a complete waste of time.
Daytona appeals more to the college crowd, young families, or aging
Barbie and Ken types who want to exhibit what they have left. The core
area around the boardwalk is lined with bars, T-shirt shacks, suntan-oil
stands, and souvenir shops. It leans toward sleazy or rowdy, even with
the recent redevelopment. However, Daytona remains pretty affordable
for a prime beach destination and visitors continue to flock here.
If you want less clutter, look to Ormond Beach, New Smyrna Beach,
Ponce Inlet (all discussed later in this chapter) or Indian Shores or
Caladesi Island State Park (both in Chapter 15). If you decide to pitch
your tent in Daytona itself, well, come expecting one big, noisy party.
After suffering a brutal 2004 hurricane season, Daytona Beach was the
victim of severe beach erosion. The worst of the erosion was found in the
New Smyrna Beach area — officials estimated the loss of sand from hurri-
canes Frances and Jeanne was between 7 and 9 feet of vertical elevation of
beach, with higher losses in some areas. At press time, the county was
seeking emergency sand replacement from the Federal Emergency
Management Agency to provide beachfront berms, or mounds of earth.

Getting There
Air travel is the perennial favorite for getting to Daytona because it
saves time and, in most cases, isn’t prohibitively expensive. But the air-
port only has two primary carriers. Also, because Daytona lies in North
Florida, it’s a little easier to reach by car or train than most Florida desti-
nations, should you prefer to travel on land.
By plane
Daytona Beach International Airport, on U.S. 92 (% 386-248-8069;
http://flydaytonafirst.com), is served by Delta and Continental
Connection. Alamo, Avis, Budget, Dollar, Enterprise, Hertz, and
National have rental counters at the airport. Yellow Cab (% 386-255-
5555) will take you from the airport to most places in the area for $8 to
$18 for up to four people.
If you want a greater selection of airlines to choose from, Orlando
International Airport (% 407-825-2001; www.state.fl.us/goaa) is
about 90 minutes southwest of Daytona by car (see Chapter 17) and is
serviced by a number of major carriers.
By car
I-95 is the best route when driving to Daytona from the north or south.
U.S. 1 is an option, but plan on traffic lights and stop signs as you pass
through tiny towns. U.S. A1A is the scenic beach route, but it’s even
slower. I-4 will get you to Daytona from Orlando. From the west, take I-10
to I-95; from the Midwest, follow I-75 to I-10, and then onward to I-95.
By train
Amtrak (% 800-872-7245; www.amtrak.com) offers scheduled service
to Deland (the county seat, located about 25 miles southwest of the
ocean) at 2491 Old New York Ave.
Orienting Yourself in Daytona Beach
Center stage is the Daytona Beach Boardwalk and the Main Street Pier,
located (appropriately enough) just east of Main Street and U.S. A1A,
and just north of the eastern end of Volusia Avenue/U.S. 92. Ormond
Beach is north of Daytona; New Smyrna Beach and Ponce Inlet are
south. The mainland and the rest of Volusia County are to the west. (See
the “Daytona Beach” map in this chapter.)
Introducing the neighborhoods
Here is a rundown of the neighborhoods in Daytona and its surrounding
area that are of interest to visitors. Most of these spots are pretty close

Daytona Beach

 Daytona Beach: The spot where most tourists come to play,
Daytona Beach has the greatest selection of hotels and restaurants
in the area, as well as a few attractions. This sector is bordered by
Highway 400/Beville Road in the south and by A1A in the east, and
it stretches northward to within 1 mile of Highway 40. It’s con-
nected to the mainland by the Memorial, Seabreeze Boulevard, and
Main Street bridges.
 Daytona Mainland: Although not as popular with tourists as the
beach side, the mainland has some prime attractions, including
Daytona International Speedway and Daytona USA. Visitors can also
find some restaurants and motels on U.S. 1 and U.S. 92/International
Speedway Boulevard.
 Ormond Beach: This town is a step quieter than Daytona, though it
has become more congested in the last 15 years. Its beach, centered
just east of where Highway 40 hits A1A/Atlantic Avenue, is its main
attraction. Most of the city’s motels and restaurants are strung
along A1A, south of Highway 40.
 New Smyrna Beach: The south coast is quieter still. It has some
nice beaches and less glitz, although, like most of the county’s east
side, this area has shoulder-to-shoulder development, including
many motels and restaurants.
Finding information after you arrive
On weekdays, you can contact the Daytona Beach Convention and
Visitors Bureau at 126 E. Orange Ave. (% 800-554-0415; www.daytona
beach.com) from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Staff members can give you advice on
attractions, accommodations, dining, and special events.
Getting Around Daytona
With the exception of the speedway area, most of the prime tourist zone
is set along A1A/Atlantic Avenue, so finding the places where you need
to be is easy. Keep in mind, however, that the highway occasionally has
some very frustrating traffic.
By car
Daytona is primarily a driver’s town, so a car is a good idea. The major
east–west roads in Daytona are U.S. 92, which is called International
Speedway Boulevard inside the city, and Highway 430/Mason Avenue,
which links the mainland to the beaches. Highway 40 is the main east-to-
west road in Ormond Beach, whereas it’s Highway 44 for New Smyrna
Beach. The main north–south roads are U.S. 1/Ridgewood Avenue,
Riverside Drive, and Beach Street on the mainland. A1A/Atlantic Avenue
and Halifax Avenue are the primary north–south beach routes.
Part VI: The Great North 
382

By taxi
Yellow Cab (% 386-255-5555) is the main taxi franchise. Fares are $2.60
for the first mile and $1.60 per additional mile.
By bus
VOLTRAN (% 386-756-7496), Volusia County’s public transit system,
runs buses and trolleys throughout the area. Fares are $1 for adults and
50¢ for seniors, kids, or riders with disabilities. 
There’s also a free tram to the beach if you park in the $5-per-day lot at
Earl Street and Atlantic Avenue, near Adventure Landing (% 386-756-
7496). Trams run every 15 minutes from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. daily.
Staying in Style
Most folks who come to this area want to stay on Daytona Beach, so
that’s the area I emphasize.
The good news for bargain hunters is that Daytona offers some of the
most affordable digs in Florida, provided you don’t arrive during a major
event or at the height of the spring break. Rates during those periods
skyrocket, hotel rooms become a very scarce commodity, and most
establishments require you to stay for at least two or three nights.
Although major chains operate in the area, hundreds of the hotels lining
Atlantic Avenue along the beach are family-owned and -operated. The
Daytona Beach Convention and Visitors Bureau, 126 E. Orange Ave.
(% 800-554-0415; www.daytonabeach.com), distributes a list of
“Superior Small Lodgings” (75 rooms or fewer) in the area, all of which
have passed muster with the bureau.
All the accommodations listed here offer free parking, air-conditioning,
and pools, unless otherwise noted.
Note: The following are year-round rates and don’t include the county’s
11.5 percent hotel tax.

Hilton Daytona Beach Oceanfront Resort

Daytona Beach Shores
Far enough south to escape the maddening crowds at Main Street, the 31⁄2
acre Hilton is among the best choices here. It welcomes you in an elegant
terra-cotta-tiled lobby with comfortable seating areas, a fountain, and
potted palms. The large guest rooms are grouped in pairs and can be

Hurricane Frances and was closed for a few months, all damages have
been repaired.

Crabby Joe’s Sunglow Pier
$
Daytona Beach
SEAFOOD
There’s nothing crabby about this fun waterfront hangout. Located on the
south end of the beach, this informal restaurant offers indoor/outdoor
dining and a fantastic view of the ocean. Joe’s serves a respectable black-
ened or grilled grouper sandwich (made more respectable by the $5 price).
The sandwich menu also includes an oyster po’boy on Cuban bread.
Heartier appetites can tackle crab cakes, fried shrimp, and, if you want to get
even with Jaws, shark bites. The portions are large and the price is right.

SEAFOOD
Watch the world glide by this seafood-serving, fishing lodge–style eatery

oriented restaurant also offers a kids’ menu and a few selections for those
counting their calories.

FUSION
Several chic dining rooms — one has beams extending like spokes from a
central pole — set the stage for an inventive, ever-changing “Menu of the
Moment” fusing a multitude of styles. Ingredients are always fresh, and the
herbs come from the restaurant’s garden. You may run into treats such as
organically groovy chicken with goat cheese, prosciutto, shiitake mush-
rooms, and Madeira wine sauce or maple-glazed crispy duck. 
See map p. 381. 123 W. Granada Blvd. % 386-615-4888. To get there: From the beaches,

Ormond Beach
AMERICAN
This family-owned and -operated restaurant has catered to locals and
tourists since 1967, offering a casual atmosphere and friendly service.
Unlike most eateries in this area, it specializes in prime Western beef, but
the seafood is far from second fiddle. Choices include salmon, Maine lob-
ster, and deviled crab.

Ocean Deck
$
Daytona Beach
SEAFOOD
Known by spring-breakers, bikers, and other beachgoers as Daytona’s best
“beach pub” since 1940, the Ocean Deck is also the best restaurant in the
busy area around the Main Street Pier. Opening to the sand and surf, the
downstairs reggae bar is as sweaty, noisy, and packed as ever (a band
plays down there nightly from 9 p.m.–2:30 a.m.). The upstairs dining room
can be noisy, too, but you can come here for some good food, reasonable
prices, and great ocean views. You can choose from a wide range of
seafood, chicken, sandwiches, and the best burgers on the beach, but
don’t pass up the mahimahi.

Daytona Beach
AMERICAN/CONTINENTAL
Located 29 floors above sea level in a circular high-rise, this restaurant’s
view is almost worth the price you pay for a meal. The menu isn’t up to
the scenery, but the chow is respectable. Pastas are some of the featured
attractions. Nonpastafarians can ponder chicken, steaks, seafood, and
surf-and-turf platters. All kids’ meals (pasta, chicken, beef, and shrimp)
cost $7.

Exploring Daytona Beach
Years ago, you could drive on most of Volusia County’s 500-foot-wide, 
23-mile-long beach. Today, only 9 miles are open to cars and only during
the day. Car-pedestrian collisions — some fatal — were an issue, but
endangered sea turtles were one of the biggest factors in the decision to
close most of the beach to vehicles. The turtles nest here in April and
May, and their young, after they’ve hatched and begun heading for the
water, don’t stand much of a chance against cars.
For beach driving, cars enter at well-marked locations, and even regular
vehicles can navigate on the hard-packed sand. The speed limit is 10 mph.
The daily cost for vehicle access is $5 February 1 through November 30.
Chapter 20: Daytona Beach 389

The top attractions
The Casements
Ormond Beach
Visit the winter home of the late billionaire John D. Rockefeller, who built
The Casements in 1912 when he discovered that he was being charged more
than the other guests at the nearby Ormond Hotel. After he moved into his
new digs, the townies dubbed him “Neighbor John.” Today, his restored
Queen Anne–style home features art exhibits, a museum of the city, a
Rockefeller-period room, and Boy Scout exhibits. Guided tours are con-
ducted Monday through Saturday. Allow one to two hours to see everything.
See map p. 381. 25 Riverside Dr. % 386-676-3216. To get there: It’s on Highway 40 at
the Granada Boulevard Bridge (Halifax River). Admission: Donations. Open: Mon–Fri
9 a.m.–5 p.m., Sat 9 a.m.–noon; tours Mon–Fri 10 a.m.–2:30 p.m., Sat 10–11:30.
Daytona International Speedway
Daytona Beach Mainland
The speedway and its new adjoining tourist attraction, Daytona USA (see
the listing later in this section), are second only to the beach in visitor mag-
netism. Built in 1959, the speedway is the home of the Daytona 500 (Feb),
Pepsi 400 (July), Speed Week (Feb), Biketoberfest (Oct), and several other
excuses to drive fast and get rowdy. Tickets for major events start at $35.
Even when there isn’t something going on at the track, you can take a 30-
minute guided tour of the World Center of Racing at Daytona USA, climbing
into a tram to see the speedway’s garages, pit area, and 31-degree banked
turns. Plans for a multimillion-dollar renovation project were underway at
press time and should be completed by the time you read this.
See map p. 381. 1801 W. International Speedway Blvd./U.S. 92. % 386-253-7223 (tick-
ets) or 386-254-7200 for tours. www.daytonaintlspeedway.com. To get there:
Take I-95’s International Speedway Blvd. exit, then head east. The huge grandstand
is really hard to miss. Nonrace admission: Free. (Who pays to look at an empty track
and stands?) Open: Daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m. 
Daytona USA
Daytona Beach Mainland
This state-of-the-art, interactive attraction gives you a chance to beat the
pros’ record at a NASCAR Nextel Cup pit stop, design and test your own
race car, compete with other aficionados in a trivia game, and call the final
laps of a race from the broadcast booth. You can also see the Stanley
Steamer, a steam-powered racer that set the World Land Speed Record in
1906, and a modern stock car that comes apart, section by section, to
show visitors how a race car is built. For an extra few bucks, you can tour
the speedway in a tram or drive a simulator against the computer. A snack
bar serves hamburgers and hot dogs. You can spend four to six hours here,
depending on whether you’re a gearhead.
Part VI: The Great North 
390

While you’re at Daytona USA, you can take three laps on the storied speed-
way at 150 mph in a real racecar. The bad news: It costs $106 and you have
to leave the driving to a pro, but the cost includes admission to Daytona
USA and the speedway tour.
See map p. 381. 2909 W. International Speedway Blvd./U.S. 92. % 386-947-6800. www.
daytonausa.com. To get there: It’s next to the speedway, 4 miles west of A1A.
Admission: $16 adults, $8 kids 6–12; combined Daytona USA visit and Daytona
International Speedway tour $20 adults, $14 kids 6–12, $5 extra for a driver and pas-
senger in Acceleration Alley simulator. Open: 9 a.m.–6 or 7 p.m., later in summer.
The Museum of Arts and Sciences
Daytona Beach
Trace Florida’s history from prehistoric times to the present. Exhibits
include the skeleton of a 13-foot-tall, 130,000-year-old giant ground sloth
that was found near the museum in 1974. The museum also features chang-
ing art exhibits and a planetarium with a computer-animated program that
shows star systems and what early Earth may have looked like were it seen
from space. Allow one to two hours to take in everything.
See map p. 381. 1040 Museum Blvd. % 386-255-0285. www.moas.org. To get there:
Take International Speedway Boulevard/U.S. 92 to Nova Road, go south, then west
on Museum Boulevard. Admission: $7 adults, $2 kids and students; planetarium
shows: $3 adults and $2 kids. Show times: Tues–Fri 2 p.m., Sat–Sun 1 and 3 p.m. Open:
Tues–Fri 9 a.m.–4 p.m., Sat–Sun noon–5 p.m.
Ponce Inlet Lighthouse and Museum
Ponce Inlet
This structure is one of only a handful of Florida lighthouses that has man-
aged to keep its brick torso. Built in 1887, it stayed in service for 83 years
and then was reactivated by the Coast Guard in 1982. If you’re up for a 203-
step climb, the 175-foot sentinel offers a great view of this bitty burg and
the ocean. The keeper’s house is the museum; the assistant’s house is
maintained as it would have appeared in 1890. The site has a lens exhibit,
a display of lights from around the world, and a 46-foot tugboat that was
built in 1938 and served until a few years ago. Allow one to two hours, and
then hit the bar across the street.
See map p. 381. 4931 S. Peninsula Dr. % 386-761-1821. www.poncelinlet.org.

More cool things to see and do
Here’s where I give visitors with varied interests a few more-specialized
options for their Daytona vacation:
 Beaches: All the Atlantic beaches here are good places to surf,
body surf, or just let the waves comb your hair. Daytona Beach,
Seabreeze Boulevard to Volusia Avenue east of A1A, is the center of
Chapter 20: Daytona Beach 391

the nerve-jarring action, with numerous concessionaires renting
rafts, beach bikes, and such (% 386-239-7873; www.volusia.org).
The Daytona Beach Boardwalk, just east of where U.S. 92 crosses
A1A and dives into the ocean, is arguably one of the top five
people-watching places in Florida, and it offers a cheesy, midway-
style arcade to sweeten (or sour) the pot. Ormond Beach, Highway
40 at A1A, is a quieter version (sans boardwalk and odd characters)
of its Daytona counterpart (% 386-239-7873; www.ormondchamber.
com). Ponce Inlet, south of Port Orange off A1A, is almost as peace-
ful (% 386-239-7873; www.volusia.org).
 Fishing: More than 25 vessels offer half- and full-day charters into
the Atlantic Ocean, where you may hook a tuna, wahoo, or grouper.
Charters by Cindy/Rainbow Charters (% 866-356-1334; www.
daytonabeachfishing.com) charges $450 half-day and $700 to
$900 full-day rates for up to six people. Cookie Cutter Sport Fishing
(% 386-304-0006; www.charternet.com/fishers/cookie
cutter) offers the same charter options for $550 to $2,000.
 Golf: In addition to the following options, you can find more local
golf information on the Web at www.golf.com and www.florida
golfing.com. If you like surfing the old-fashioned way, request
course information from the Florida Sports Foundation (% 850-
488-8347) or Florida Golfing (% 877-222-4653). Here are a couple
of the better local courses:
• Deltona Hills Golf and Country Club, 1120 Elkcam Blvd.,
Daytona (% 386-789-4911), has rolling hills and fairways.
Greens fees are $25 to $40 in the winter and under $25 in the
summer.
• Daytona Beach Golf Club, 600 Wilder Blvd. (% 386-258-3119),
has twin courses — the south course has fairways adorned
with palm trees and lakes, and the north course offers rolling
fairways with lush vegetation. Greens fees are $25 to $40 in the
winter and under $25 in the summer.
 Parks: Washington Oaks State Park, 6400 Oceanshore Blvd./A1A,
Palm Coast (% 386-446-6780; www.floridastateparks.org/
washingtonoaks), is a 19th-century plantation turned 400-acre
park that stretches from the Atlantic to the Matanzas River. You can
take guided tours, but exploring the ornamental gardens, tidal
pools, and dunes on your own is much more fun. The park is 
14 miles north of Flagler Beach (about 35 miles north of Daytona
Beach) on A1A. Admission is $3.75 per car.
Shopping
There are some shopping “districts” in and around Daytona, but remem-
ber that this is a tourist zone and has all the related trappings — over-
priced antiques shops on one side and trinket shacks on the other. Look
Part VI: The Great North 
392

for the tackiest souvenirs along Atlantic Avenue/A1A, especially near
the boardwalk (where U.S. 92 connects with A1A). Most shops sell
barely-there bathing suits, seashells, and T-shirts decorated with some
of the world’s most forgettable expressions.
If you’re into yard sales and produce stands on a moderately large scale,
the Daytona Beach Flea and Farmers Market, U.S. 92 at I-95, (% 386-
253-3330; www.daytonafleamarket.net) is a funky place to shop for
produce, “junque,” and white-elephant gifts Friday through Sunday, from
8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Main St. Inc., 512 Canal St. (% 386-423-3131; http://volusia.com/
nsbmainstreetinc), in the New Smyrna Beach Downtown Historic
District, has a scattering of antiques dealers, jewelers, and home-furnishing
shops. There’s also a farmer’s market on Saturdays from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m.
Riverfront Marketplace, 300 S. to 300 N. Beach St., Daytona Beach 
(% 386-872-3272; www.riverfrontmarketplace.com), offers dozens of
restaurants, shops, boutiques, salons, a day spa, bars, a live theater, and
the Halifax History Museum.
Volusia Mall, 1700 International Speedway Blvd. (% 386-253-6783;
www.volusiamall.net), has more than 100 stores anchored by Macy’s,
Dillard’s, and Sears. Some smaller nearby strip centers feature stores
such as T.J. Maxx.
Living It Up After Dark
In addition to the following, you can find a lot of action along the main
beach strip, A1A/Atlantic Avenue. You should also check the Daytona
Beach News-Journal for its Friday entertainment section.
Bars
600 North, 600 N. Atlantic (% 904-255-4471), is Baywatch revisited, with
buxom bikini babe staffers who have actually been extras on the show,
and a year-round spring-break vibe with assorted drinking and thong-
sporting contests. 
The Boot Hill Saloon, 310 Main St. (% 904-258-9506), is a bluesy, brew-
sy honky-tonk especially popular during race and bike weeks. If line
dancing is your thang, then scoot your boots over to the Rockin’ Ranch,
801 S. Nova Rd. (% 904-947-0785), an uber fun country-western bar with
live music and even line-dancing lessons.
Main Street and Seabreeze Boulevard on the beach are happening
areas where dozens of bars (and a few topless shows) cater to leather-
clad bikers.
A popular beachfront bar for more than 40 years, the Ocean Deck
Restaurant & Beach Club, 127 S. Ocean Ave. (% 386-253-5224; see listing
Chapter 20: Daytona Beach 393

under “Dining Out” earlier in this chapter), is packed with a mix of locals
and tourists, young and old, who come for live music and cheap drinks.
Reggae or ska bands play after 9:30 p.m. There’s valet parking after dark,
or leave your vehicle at Ocean Deck’s Reggae Republic surf shop on
Atlantic Avenue.
The River Deck Night Club & Restaurant, 2739 S. Ridgewood, Ormond
Beach (% 386-761-0022), features live dance tunes, Wednesday, Friday,
and Saturday. Frank’s Front Row, 308 Seabreeze, Daytona Beach (% 386-
255-9221), has live contemporary music nightly. Neither has a cover
charge.
Performing arts
The Peabody Auditorium, 600 Auditorium Blvd., Daytona Beach (% 386-
671-3460; www.peabodyauditorium.org), is home to the Daytona
Beach Symphony Society, the Civic Ballet of Volusia County, and the
Concert Showcase of Florida. It also hosts touring companies.
The modern Ormond Beach Performing Arts Center, 399 N. U.S. Hwy. 1
(% 386-676-3375; www.ormondbeach.org/pac), is home to profes-
sional, community, and children’s theater productions, and it offers
classes in the performing arts. Volusia County’s largest venue, Ocean
Center, 101 N. Atlantic Ave. (% 386-254-4500; www.oceancenter.com),
offers sporting events such as rodeos and occasional concerts.
Day-tripping to Ocala
Before it became a major breeding center for thoroughbred race horses,
Ocala’s main claim to fame was serving as an occasional movie and tele-
vision set. Johnny Weissmuller (arguably the best Tarzan ever), and
Lloyd Bridges (from the old Sea Hunt television show), got into the swim
and filmed at Silver Springs.
Today, this full-fledged attraction 60 miles west of Daytona has dual faces.
Silver Springs is a throwback-but-modernized Florida attraction that lures
guests with glass-bottom boat rides above crystal-clear springs, a jungle
cruise (remember, this is north central Florida, where jungle translates
into “swamps” or “scrub land”), a safari ride, and encounters with pan-
thers, alligators, crocodiles, bears, and other critters. (Admission: $32.99
adults, $23.99 kids 3–12; add $2 to get into Wild Waters on the same day.)
Wild Waters, a neighboring water park, costs $23.99 adults, $20.99 kids 
3 to 12 by itself. It has a wave pool, water slides, and plenty more. Silver
Springs also has a country-music concert series (% 352-236-2121;
www.silversprings.com and www.wildwaterspark.com).
Ocala Carriage and Tours is a delightful way to see some of the area’s
horse farms or the city’s downtown historic district while being lullabyed
by the clippity-clop of a draft horse’s hoofs. The 70-minute tours cost 
Part VI: The Great North 
394

$95 for up to four adults and two kids (% 877-996-2252; www.ocala
carriage.com).
Ocala Stud Farm (% 352-237-2171) and Double Diamond (% 352-237-
3834) also offer walking or driving farm tours, and Young’s Paso Finos
(% 352-867-5273) and Ocala Foxtrotter Ranch (% 352-347-5551) offer
horseback rides.
You can get more information on these and other activities as well as
hotels and restaurants from the Ocala/Marion County Chamber of
Commerce (% 352-629-8051; www.ocalacc.com).

 Seeing a 19th-century sugar plantation
R
emember Ponce de León from your high school history class? Well,
it turns out he was a better dreamer than an astronomer. He was
supposed to land at Bimini and find the “fountain of youth” that would
keep Jolly Ol’ King Ferdinand and his daughter, Juana the Mad (we’re not
making that up), on their thrones forever. But Ponce bounced his
azimuth off the wrong star and wound up near present-day Cape
Canaveral. Instead of eternal life and the hand of Juana, he got hissing
snakes, angry natives, and alligators that were delighted to sample a
little Spanish take-out.
As for the fabled fountain, well, St. Augustine has one, complete with a gift
shop selling glow-in-the-dark key chains. The fountain itself is indoors. It
even has a dome. And if you sip the water, you’re making a big mistake. It
contains sulfur, which, as anyone who’s ever been held captive in chem-
istry class knows, smells like rotten eggs.
More on that domed scandal later in this chapter, but for now, here’s my
three-minute thumbnail on this region.
After you drive away from the coast, the Great Northeast is about as
rural as Florida gets. The St. Johns River is the interior’s biggest attrac-
tion. Although the river is a magnet for anglers, boaters, and other river
rats, for most tourists it’s little more than a reference point or a back-
drop for some other activity, closer to the coast.
Due to the lack of action away from the coast, this chapter’s tour bus
stays near the Atlantic. I divide this region into two general areas, south to
north. The oldest city in the United States, St. Augustine offers a lot to do,
especially if you like to live history. Although Jacksonville is the largest
city in Northeast Florida, it’s mainly an insurance and banking center but
does have a few interesting attractions for visitors. Its neighbors,

Fernandina Beach and Amelia Island, have colorful histories but, again,
not much in the way of attractions.
Now, queue up Willie Nelson’s gem “On the Road Again,” and I can you
get started down the road to Northeast Florida.
Getting a Feel for Northeast Florida 
It’s kind of ironic that the alleged Fountain of Youth is located in
America’s oldest European settlement. Alas, St. Augustine is like a fine
wine — it has aged beautifully in all its 17th-century glory. Families love
it here not just because it’s steeped in history, hence educational for the
kids, but because the old-world vibe is conducive to romance. 
Jacksonville, on the other hand, isn’t exactly romantic. The once indus-
trial city has gotten hipper in a cosmopolitan way thanks, in part, to the
2005 SuperBowl and all the celebrities who came with it. Jax, as it’s
fondly known, has a riverfront that is akin to NYC’s South Street Seaport
and a downtown that’s trying to come into its own with new restaurants,
bars, and attractions. Not so far from Jax is Amelia Island — now that’s
romantic
Located on the northernmost barrier island of Florida, Amelia Island fea-
tures 13 miles of gorgeous beach with a quaint Victorian-style town. Just
45-minutes northeast of downtown Jax, Amelia Island is the ideal get-
away for couples looking to escape “city” life.
St. Augustine
Established in 1565, St. Augustine is the oldest continuously settled city
in the United States. The city, which blissfully refuses to indulge in Botox
treatments, offers visitors a bounty of history in its architecture, attrac-
tions, and accommodations. At least a half-dozen places in town claim to
be the oldest something or other. A few of them actually are. In addition
to the history, St. Aug has a delightfully European, old-world feel to it
with bona fide cobblestone streets, winding roads, excellent restaurants,
and even a bit of nightlife. (Skip ahead to see a map of St. Augustine.)
Getting there
The farther north you travel, the easier it is to drive from other parts of
the country, but air travel is the arrival-and-departure method of choice.
By plane
Jacksonville International Airport (% 904-741-4902; www.jaxports.
com), which is 43 miles north of St. Augustine, serves this area. A dozen
major lines, including American, Continental, Delta, Northwest, and US
Airways, fly in and out of here. Avis, Budget, Dollar, Enterprise, Hertz,

Information
i
St. Augustine

National, and Thrifty have rental-car desks on the airport’s lower 
level. Taxi and shuttle services from Jacksonville to St. Augustine are
cost-prohibitive.
By car
From the north, take I-95 south to Highway 16, then go east into the city,
and go south on U.S. 1/Ponce de Leon Boulevard. From the west, take 
I-10 to I-95 and follow the preceding directions. From the Midwest, follow
I-75 to I-10, then I-95.
Getting around
The city’s historic downtown is small and user-friendly enough that I
recommend you park your car and hoof it along the cobbled, winding
streets of St. Augustine’s historic district. For parking information, see
“By car,” later in this chapter. 
Here are some other options for getting around town:
By car
In addition to U.S. 1 (which becomes Ponce de Leon Boulevard in the
city), A1A is the main north–south route, and it stays pretty close to the
water. In town, you may also use Cordova and St. George streets to travel
north and south. East–west routes include Highways 16 and 312, King
Street, and May Street.
On-street parking is nonexistent in St. Augustine’s historic district, and
metered parking lots are difficult to find and are often full. Your best bet
is to park in the large municipal lots behind the visitor center on Castillo
Drive. The $3 fee is good for two consecutive days, so you may leave and
return at will. Plus, most of the top historic attractions are within walk-
ing distance of the center, as it is virtually across the street from the Old
City Gates. 
By taxi
For a taxi, call Yellow Cab (% 904-824-6888) or Ancient City Cab (% 904-
824-8161). St. Augustine taxis use a complicated zone system, but figure
on spending $2 to $8 for one person and $1.50 for each extra body.
Those rates will get you to most parts of the city.
By guided tour
St. Augustine Historical Sightseeing Tours (% 904-826-4218; www.
infoperson.com/no1tours.htm) offers a one-hour sightseeing jaunt
plus you can use its trolleys to get to 20 stops around town for up to
three days ($16 adults, $7 kids 6–11, free for children under 6). This is an
inexpensive way to travel the downtown historic district.
I tell you about two others guided tours later in this chapter under
“Going on a guided tour.”
Chapter 21: Northeast Florida 399

Staying in style
St. Augustine has plenty of moderate and inexpensive hotels. If you want 
a unique experience, however, stay in one of the city’s bed-and-breakfasts,
many of which occupy restored historic homes. Note, however, that 
kids usually aren’t welcome; ditto for smokers. The Historic Inns of St.
Augustine, P.O. Box 5268, St. Augustine, FL 33085-5268 (www.staugustine
inns.com), provides visitors with a list describing its member properties.
Hotel rates increase significantly on weekends, when the city is usually
inundated with visitors, so try coming during the week to lower your
costs. Also, don’t forget to add the hotel tax of 9 percent to your budget.
All the accommodations listed here offer free parking, air-conditioning,
and pools, unless otherwise noted.
The top hotels
Alexander Homestead Bed and Breakfast
$$
St. Augustine
Victor, Victorian! This restored 1888 home is a Kodak moment, to say the
least. One room has a Jacuzzi, two have fireplaces, and each have laven-
der sachets tucked away in drawers, their own private porches, and
antiques. Gourmet breakfasts include homemade French toast with
almond syrup, and at night, you can have a glass of complimentary brandy
to go along with your complimentary chocolate. Even better, coffee is
delivered directly to your door in the morning so there’s no need to really
have to stir yourself too much. The only drawback is the lack of a pool.

Casa Monica Hotel
$$–$$$
St. Augustine
You’ve really arrived in St. Augustine if you stay at the Casa Monica Hotel.
Most of the guest quarters are spacious and fully modern hotel rooms,
with Iberian-style armoires, wrought-iron headboards, and tapestry
drapes. “Premium” rooms have sitting areas with sofas and easy chairs.
Much more interesting are the “signature suites” installed in the building’s
two tile-topped towers and fortresslike central turret. Each of these one-
to four-bedroom units is unique. One in the turret has a half-round living
room with gun-port windows overlooking the historic district, while a
three-story town-house model in one of the towers has a huge whirlpool
bathroom on its top floor. The hotel’s restaurant, 95 Cordova, is one of the
city’s best. For $15 a day, guests can use the pools, restaurants, and other
facilities at The Serenata Beach Club, an exclusive oceanfront club located
ten minutes from the hotel.

St. Augustine
This 52-room chain motel is 6 blocks (1 mile) north of the historic district.
It isn’t luxurious, but it’s near the heart of the action and the privately run
sightseeing trolleys (see “Getting around,” earlier in this chapter) stop
here. It presents a clean option for those on tighter budgets. Rates include
continental breakfast, and all local phone calls are free.

Victorian House

St. Augustine
This 1897 Victorian find comes complete with wraparound porch and con-
verted carriage house divided into four units, all of which have TVs and
private entrances. Kids are more than welcome at the carriage house, but
they aren’t allowed to stay in the main house, not that they’d want to
anyway — there are no TVs. The main house features four units, all of
which are decked out in antiques. Continental breakfast is included in the
rates.

Overlooking Matanzas Bay, this two-story, Key West–

Located in the heart of the historic district, this
Hosteling International member offers bargain rates if you don’t mind
the spartan quarters, the lack of a pool, and, in the case of some rooms,
sharing a bath. It’s best known for its all-you-can-eat pancake breakfast,
which is included in the rock-bottom rates. See map p. 398. 32 Treasury St.
% 904-808-1999. www.piratehaus.com.
Dining out 
When you consider St. Augustine’s popularity with the tourist crowd, it
isn’t surprising that the city is loaded with tourist-trap restaurants and
fast-food joints. That said, the dining in town is, on the whole, pretty
good and fairly priced. The local cuisine is (no surprise!) seafood mixed
with a variety of other cuisines. Note: All Florida restaurants and food-
serving bars are smoke-free.
Don’t forget to add the 6 percent sales tax to your meal budget.

Gypsy Cab Co.
$$
St. Augustine
NEW AMERICAN
The menu changes frequently in this restaurant that looks like a gaudy
house built in the ’40s or ’50s (which it is). The “urban cuisine” here 
is among the city’s most interesting and is expertly prepared by the 
chef-owner, Ned Pollack. Try the black-bean soup and veal with bacon-
horseradish cream, if available. As a capper, I recommend Amaretto
cheesecake or Key lime pie. The Gypsy Bar & Grill (next door) serves
lunch from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. weekdays.

An accidental tourist in these parts, La Parisienne is a welcome respite from
all the nearby Americana. Despite its name, this lovely dining room evokes

curtained windows, and ladder-back chairs. Changing seasonally, the menu
always features fresh seafood, and in fall you’ll see venison and quail.

I highly doubt that the Victorians who originally lived in this 1877 house
ate as well as you will at Raintree, best known for its cashew-encrusted
pork tenderloin mignonettes with a champagne and ruby raspberry sauce,
beef Wellington, and rack of New Zealand lamb. A list of over 300 wines
ain’t too shabby, either.

Exploring St. Augustine
History is the highlight in St. Augustine, with 144 blocks of houses and
buildings that are on the National Register of Historic Places. The his-
toric district centers on St. George Street, a few blocks east of U.S. 1.
Much of the action takes place on St. George, the Avenida Menendez,
King Street, San Marco Avenue, Castillo Drive, or across the Bridge of
Lions, which leads to Anastasia Island. 
The top attractions
Bridge of Lions
St. Augustine
An Italian sculptor carved the two king of beasts on the historic Bridge of
Lions, which goes from the mainland to Anastasia Island. Alas, the artist
left a few physical attributes off his lions, and legend has it that he was
subjected to such ridicule by townies that he stabbed himself with a blunt
sculpting knife. The Bridge, located where U.S. 1/San Marco turns into
Anastasia Boulevard and crosses the Intracoastal Waterway, is one of the
most photographed (and congested, thanks to a drawbridge and barge
traffic) sights in town.
See map p. 398. 
Castillo de San Marcos National Monument
St. Augustine
Built in the 18th century, this stoic Spanish fortress includes plenty of bas-
tions, dungeons, and artillery positions to explore. Additionally, the
National Park Service puts on a number of events here, including torch-
light tours and reenactments. Most folks can see it all in one to two hours.
See map p. 398. 1 E. Castillo Dr. (at San Marco Avenue). % 904-829-6506, ext. 234.
www.nps.gov/casa. Admission: $5 adults, $2 kids 6–16, free for children 5 and
under. Open: Daily 8:45 a.m.–4:45 p.m.

Fountain of Youth
St. Augustine
Earlier in this chapter, I promised to get back to (drumroll, please) Ponce
de León’s quest. So, here you are. This fountain’s for you, if you’re the kind
who flushes, er, spends money on anything. If you go, I hope you remem-
ber my warning about this foul-tasting liquid. There is also a planetarium
where you can stargaze at the dome, a 45-minute tour that gets downright
silly, and the inevitable Ponce de Leon Gift Shop. Allow 90 minutes to see
everything.
See map p. 398. 11 Magnolia Ave. % 800-356-8222 or 904-829-3168. www.fountain
ofyouthflorida.com. Admission: $5.75 adults, $4.75 seniors, $2.75 kids 6–12.
Open: Daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m. 
The Lightner Museum
St. Augustine
Dating to 1888, this cutie began life as Henry Flagler’s elaborate, Spanish
Renaissance–style resort spa. These days it makes a gorgeous museum
that has substantial collections of cut glass, vases, and wood-jointed dolls.
The first floor has a row of shops. You can also meet a mummy, equally
dead birds, samples of Victorian glassblowing, and a collection of rocks,
minerals, and Native-American artifacts in period cases. Allow two hours
to see the highlights.
See map p. 398. 75 King St. % 904-824-2874. www.lightnermuseum.org. To get
there: Located at King and Cordova. Admission: $6 adults, $2 kids 12–18, free for chil-
dren 11 and under. Open: Daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m. 
The Oldest Wooden Schoolhouse
St. Augustine
This is one of many “oldests” in this city (others include a house, store, jail,
and so on). Built in 1763, the red-cedar schoolhouse is held together by
wooden pegs and nails that were made by hand. Today, the last class —
held in 1864 — is re-created for visitors. You’ll be ready to bolt when the bell
rings 45 minutes later (if not before). 
See map p. 398. 14 George St. % 904-829-9729. www.oldestschoolhouse.com.
Admission: $3 adults, $2.50 seniors, $2 kids 6–12, free for children 5 and under. Open:
Daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m. 
St. Augustine Alligator Farm and Zoological Park
St. Augustine
It’s not as historic as some landmarks, but it is the oldest continuously run-
ning reptile retreat in Florida, having opened in 1893. The main attraction
is Land of Crocodiles, home to all 23 species of these critters. Until 1999,
its star resident was Gomek, an 18-foot, 1,800-pound Porosus crocodile that,
in his native New Guinea, munched on water buffaloes and slow-moving
Chapter 21: Northeast Florida 405

humans. Alas, Gomek has gone to that big swamp in the sky, but his skin
has been stuffed so you can sit on him and get your picture taken. The park
also has alligator, snake, and bird shows. Figure on staying four to five
hours.
See map p. 398. 999 Anastasia Blvd. % 904-824-3337. www.alligatorfarm.com.
To get there: Located across the Bridge of Lions on A1A. Admission: $14.95 adults,
$8.95 kids 5–11, free for children 4 and under. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m. (until 5 p.m.
in winter).
Spanish Quarter Village
St. Augustine
If the kids complain about how hard they’ve got it these days, take them
here and they’ll never complain again. Okay, well, they will at least appre-
ciate what they’ve got! A living-history village, it dates to 1740 and features
blacksmiths, weavers, and woodworkers, among other tradespeople. The
nearby City Gate, on San Marco near Orange, was erected in 1808 by the
Spanish as a defensive wall. Mission of Nombre de Dios, west of San Marco
Avenue on Old Mission Road at the Intracoastal, goes way back to 1565
and has a 208-foot cross that’s visible from 25 miles at sea. It’s where the
first Catholic Mass in the United States was said, but Mass is no longer
offered there. Allow two to four hours to see it all.

Sun–Thurs 9 a.m.–5:30 p.m., Fri–Sat 9 a.m.–9 p.m. 
Finding more cool things to see and do
If you need a break from sightseeing and want to catch a ray on the
beach or snag a grouper that could feed an army, you can choose from
several other outdoor recreational activities. And when you’re ready to
hit the touring trail again, you may want to try one of the tour compa-
nies that offer specialized programs for visitors, later in this chapter. 
 Beaches: Vilano Beach, on the north side of St. Augustine Inlet on
A1A, is a public beach with restrooms, volleyball courts, and picnic
areas. After you cross the Bridge of Lions, Yankee Beach is the first
stop on Anastasia Island. It earned its name because many north-
ern tourists never venture beyond it. Those who do, find Anastasia
Island State Recreation Area (% 904-461-2033; www.abfla.com/
parks/Anastasia/anastasia.html). This 1,700-acre bird sanctu-
ary has 5 miles of beaches, lagoons, sabal palms, and sea oats,
growing wild from 20-foot dunes. Admission costs $5 per car.
 Fishing: Snapper, grouper, amberjack, and other species are common
catches in the Atlantic Ocean. You can catch a large charter boat
from Sea Love Marina, 250 Vilano Rd./A1A N. (% 904-824-3328;
www.sealovefishing.com). Day-trips are $50; $40 kids 14 and
under.

 Golf: You can obtain local course information online at www.golf.
com and www.floridagolfing.com, or you can call the Florida
Sports Foundation (% 850-488-8347) or Florida Golfing (% 877-
222-4653). The popular-but-pricey World Golf Village (% 904-940-
6088; www.wgv.com) offers 54 holes, including The Slammer and
The Squire, a fairly open course with kind greens. Greens fees are
$110 and up in winter, $86 to $110 in summer. St. Johns County
Golf Course, 4900 Cypress Links Blvd., St. Augustine (% 904-825-
4900; www.sjcgc.com), is forgiving of the average player and his or
her wallet — fees here are $25 to $40 year-round.
Going on a guided tour
St. Augustine Historical Sightseeing Tours (% 904-826-4218; www.
infoperson.com/no1tours.htm) offers a one-hour sightseeing tour
that also entitles you to transportation on its trolleys for three days ($15
adults, $5 kids 6–11, free for children under 6).
St. Augustine Transfer Company (% 904-829-2391) offers 45-minute to
1-hour horse-drawn carriage tours through the historic district. Tours
cost $20 for adults, $10 for kids 6 to 11; free for children under 6; mini-
mum $80 for a private carriage. You can flag a carriage down at the bay-
front area.
Ancient City Tours (% 800-597-7177 or 904-797-0807; www.ancientcity
tours.net) offers several guided tours, including a theater tour and an
evening ghost walk. Prices begin at $7.
Shopping
St. Augustine doesn’t have any special shopping areas, but you can find
an assortment of shops, scattered throughout the historic district, that
sell everything from antiques to local hot sauces. The heart of the dis-
trict is a pedestrians-only area on St. George Street between Cuna Street
and Cathedral Place. The trolleys make frequent stops here.
There are two outlet malls on Highway 16, near I-95. Belz Factory Outlet
World (% 904-826-1311; www.belz.com) has 65 shops, including
Tommy Hilfiger, Liz Claiborne, Timberland, and Royal Doulton. The St.
Augustine Outlet Center (% 904-825-1555; www.staugustineoutlets.
com) houses 95 stores, including Coach, Donna Karan, Company Store,
and Brooks Brothers.
Living it up after dark
St. Augustine has dozens of small bars scattered along the beach and
inside the historic district. Ann O’Malley’s, 23 Orange St. (% 904-825-
4040), is a friendly Irish pub that pours a good selection of ales, stouts,
and drafts. A1A Ale Works, 1 King St. (% 904-829-2977), is a microbrew-
ery that attracts a young-to-middle-age crowd. The Oasis Deck &
Restaurant, 4000 U.S. A1A (% 904-471-3424), has live music or a DJ
most nights.

Jacksonville, Amelia Island, 
and Fernandina Beach
Jacksonville is part Navy town and part business destination, though it
has a few fun attractions and nice beaches. Along the St. Johns River,
downtown Jax is rather vibrant, a center of activity during weekdays and
on weekend afternoons and evenings when locals hang out at restau-
rants and bars at Jacksonville Landing and the Southbank Riverwalk —
two dining and entertainment complexes that have helped revitalize the
downtown area. (See maps for Jacksonville, Amelia Island, and
Fernandina Beach later in this chapter.) To its north, you’ll find Amelia
Island, a natural, upscale resort area, and Fernandina Beach, which has
much of the area’s history (but is nothing, in scope, like St. Augustine).
Getting there
Here, we go back to the usual three transportation modes: planes, trains,
and automobiles.
By plane
Jacksonville International Airport (% 904-741-4902; www.jaxports.
org) has a dozen major carriers, including American, Continental,
Delta, Northwest, TWA, and US Airways. Avis, Budget, Dollar,
Enterprise, Hertz, National, and Thrifty have rental-car desks on the
airport’s lower level. Gator City Taxi and Shuttle (% 904-355-8294)
charges $24 to $96 for up to four passengers, depending on where you
want to go in the county. The airport is 45 minutes from Amelia Island,
25 minutes from Fernandina Beach, and 15 minutes from downtown
Jacksonville.
By car
From the north, take I-95 south. From the west, take I-10 to I-95. From the
Midwest, follow I-75 to I-10, then I-95.
By train
Amtrak (% 800-872-7245; www.amtrak.com) has a terminal in down-
town Jacksonville at 3570 Clifford Lane, off U.S. 1 and just north of 45th
Street.
Getting around
Jacksonville is a large city, and Fernandina Beach and Amelia Island are
about 30 miles north of town. Unless you’re going to stick close to a base
camp, you’re going to need wheels of one sort or another. I recommend
a rental car as your best mode of transportation.

By car
I-10 and I-95 enter the heart of the city. I-295, with help from Highways 9A
and 115, creates a loop that will help you avoid the traffic-laden down-
town business district.
Bay Street divides the north and south. Main Street divides the east and
west. But be wary of any address that has East, West, North, or South
attached to it; compass directions don’t always correspond to addresses
and street signs. The best thing to do is ask someone at your destination
for exact directions from your starting point to your finish line.
By taxi
Gator City Taxi (% 904-355-8294) charges $1.25 to get in and $1.25 for
each mile thereafter.
By bus
Fares on Jacksonville Transportation Authority buses (% 904-630-3125;
www.jtaonthemove.com) range from 75¢ to $1.50. Remember, though,
that public bus routes are the worst mode of transportation for tourists —
they’re slow and designed primarily for commuters and locals heading to
business and shopping venues.
Staying in style
Jacksonville offers a variety of accommodations, from upscale resorts to
business hotels to chain motels. A number of chains are represented along
I-95. The downtown hotels cater to the business crowd, and rates there are
higher during the week but can drop quite a bit on weekends. The beach
hotels tend to be less expensive from December through March. The
Jacksonville Convention and Visitors Bureau (see “Information” in “Fast
Facts” at the end of this chapter) provides visitors with a list of accommo-
dations in the area.
Hotel taxes add a whopping 91⁄2 to 14 percent to your bill, depending on
where you stay in this region, so ask when making a reservation.
Accommodations listed here offer free parking, air-conditioning, and
pools unless otherwise noted.

Exploring the Jacksonville area
Jacksonville may cater more to business travelers than tourists, but
there are still some dandy attractions, ranging from charming historic
districts to animals that love to get into the act.
The top attractions
Adventure Landing
Jacksonville Beach
Kids and kids at heart have a ball in this amusement park, where you can
challenge an 18-hole miniature golf course, do battle laser-tag style, tear it
up in a go-kart, or try your hand at video games. Shipwreck Island,
Adventure Landing’s water park, will keep you cool with pools, hydro
slides, and tube runs, including one that has a 40-foot vertical drop. Allow
two to four hours. Note: The water park is only open from May until
September.
See map p. 409. 1944 Beach Blvd. (at 20th Street). % 904-246-4388. www.adventure
landing.com. To get there: Take Atlantic Boulevard east to St. Johns Bluff Road,
make a right, and go left on Beach Boulevard. Admission: Prices vary by attraction,
from $5.99–$19.99 for adults, $3.99–$16.99 for kids. Open: Sun–Thurs noon–9 p.m., Fri
noon–midnight, Sat 11 a.m.–midnight.
BEAKS
Big Talbot Island
It’s an acronym for Bird Emergency Aid and Kare Sanctuary, and it’s a neat
eco stop, where staffers raise and care for thousands of injured or

deformed birds, including bald eagles, ospreys, pelicans, and owls. BEAKS
also cares for deer, but birds come first. In addition to the one-hour round-
trip from Jacksonville, plan to spend one to two hours visiting.
See map p. 411. 12084 Houston Ave. % 904-251-2473 (expect a message about how
to care for an injured bird but leave a message of your own, and they’ll call back).
ww4.choice.net/~matschca/beaks.html. To get there: It’s complicated; ask
for directions when you call. Admission: You’ll feel guilty without leaving a donation.
Open: Tues–Sun noon–4 p.m.
Centre Street
Fernandina Beach
Centre Street and Historic Fernandina Beach offer a self-charted walking
tour that costs nothing but calories. The 50-block downtown historic dis-
trict is loaded with Victorian and Queen Anne homes that date to the
town’s birth as a port in the mid-19th century. Grab a tour map from the
Chamber of Commerce, located in the old depot, 102 Centre St. (% 800-
226-3542 or 904-261-3248). It’s open between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Monday
through Friday. If you have strong legs, good shoes, and a desire to shop,
this is worth three to four hours of your time.
See map p. 411. 
Fort Caroline National Memorial
Jacksonville
This is a shrine to the short-lived French Huguenot settlement founded
here in 1564. The park has a replica of the fort, a museum of French and
Native-American artifacts, and a trail.
See map p. 409. 12713 Fort Caroline Rd. % 904-641-7155. www.nps.gov/foca. To
get there: Take Atlantic Boulevard east, head past Southside Expressway, turn on
Monument Boulevard, and follow the signs. Admission: Free. Open: Daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m. 
Fort Clinch State Park
Fernandina Beach
The sign is small, and most passersby don’t have a clue that this treasure
is just over the dunes. After you slap through the mosquitoes, there’s a
small museum and store and then a crushed-shell trail through coastal
scrub to the fort. A small museum-style interpretive center is on the
grounds, but the rangers are what really make this site unique. Dressed in
wool uniforms (even in summer), they give a stark but frequently humor-
ous look at a soldier’s life in the 1860s. In addition to living-history lessons,
the fort offers candlelight tours many Friday and Saturday evenings. On
the first weekend of the month, some 40 volunteers demonstrate the daily
routines of a surgeon’s office, carpentry shop, forge, and kitchen. An hour
or two should be all you need to see the park.

Jacksonville Landing
Downtown Jacksonville
Resembling New York City’s South Street Seaport, Boston’s Faneuil Hall,
Miami’s Bayside, and Baltimore’s Inner Harbor, this glass-and-steel com-
plex on the north bank of the river serves as the focus of downtown activ-
ity. Yeah, you may see a mime or two occasionally, and there’s a Hooter’s,
a Ruby Tuesday, and a Starbuck’s, but there’s also amazing local live
music, good nonchain sushi, Thai, and Mexican, too. Unlike in the other
cities, this complex is not just for tourists and is command central for
many locals looking for a lively day/night out. There are more than 65
stores here, but shopping is secondary to dining and entertainment. You
can choose from a half-dozen full-service restaurants plus an inexpensive
food court with indoor and outdoor seating overlooking the river. The
Landing is the scene of numerous special events, ranging from arts festi-
vals to baseball-card shows, and outdoor rock, blues, country, and jazz
concerts on weekends. Call or check the Web site to find out what’s going
on during your stay.
See map p. 409. 2 Independent Dr. (between Main and Pearl streets), on the St. Johns
River. % 904-353-1188. www.jacksonvillelanding.com. To get there: From 
I-95, take exit 107 downtown to Main Street, go over the Blue Bridge, and turn left at

Sun noon–5:30 p.m.; bars and restaurants open later. 
Jacksonville Zoo
Jacksonville
Lions, tigers, white rhinos, cheetahs, jaguars, warthogs, anteaters, and low-
land gorillas. Wow! This city zoo has grown up in recent years and is one of
the top five in Florida. Pay attention to the thatched roof when you enter —
Zulu craftsmen built it. The newest attraction, Range of the Jaguar, opened
in the spring of 2004 to the tune of $15.4 million. Although this spotlight fea-
tures the jaguar, you will see other animals here as well, such as golden lion
tamarins, tapirs, capybaras, giant river otters, anteaters, and a variety of
bird, reptile, amphibian, and fish species including the anaconda. Allow two
to four hours to see it all.
See map p. 409. 8605 Zoo Rd. % 904-757-4463. www.jaxzoo.org. To get there: Take

418

Kingsley Plantation
Jacksonville
Here’s a lesson on 19th-century Florida plantation life and slavery. Built in
1817 by Zephaniah Kingsley, this plantation grew sugar cane and sea-island
cotton. The site has a well-preserved plantation house as well as the ruins
of 23 slave quarters that were built from oyster shell and sand. There are
ranger-guided tours, but scheduling is a bit inconsistent, so call to check
on times. Allow one to two hours to catch the highlights.
See map p. 409. On the Avenue of Palms. % 904-251-3537. To get there: Located north
of Mayport U.S. Naval Station on A1A; follow the signs west on Palmetto Avenue (a
gravel road). Admission: Free. Open: Daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m. 
Little and Big Talbot Island State Parks
Mayport
Little Talbot is a 2,500-acre preserve with salt marshes, hammocks, and
Atlantic dunes, along with 4 miles of gorgeous beaches carved by erosion
and decorated by rocks and driftwood. You may also spot some of the
park’s river otters. Located on the same stretch of coastline, Big Talbot
Island State Park has some spectacular bluffs, the ruins of two plantations,
and five marked trails that wind through dunes, salt marshes, tidal creeks,
and prairie. If you’re a park or beach buff, allow three to four hours.
See map p. 411. 20 miles northeast of downtown Jacksonville. % 904-251-2320. To get
there: Little and Big Talbot islands are off A1A, north of the Mayport Naval Station.
Admission: $4 per car at Little Talbot, $2 per car at Big Talbot. Open: Daily 8 a.m to dusk.
SouthBank Riverwalk
Jacksonville
Walkers, joggers, tourists, and people-watchers frequent this 1.2-mile
boardwalk on the south side of the St. Johns River. At night, it’s colorfully
illuminated. By day, the biggest attraction is the Museum of Science and
History, located at Museum Circle and San Marco Boulevard (% 904-
396-7062; www.themosh.org), which has some interactive exhibits for
kids. The Riverwalk also has occasional seafood and arts festivals.

Chapter 21: Northeast Florida 419

 Beaches: The four most popular bathing spots are Atlantic Beach
(also a popular surfing beach) (east end of Highway 10), Neptune
Beach (on A1A, 1 mile south of Highway 10), Jacksonville Beach
(east end of U.S. 90), and Ponte Vedra Beach (Highway 203, 2 miles
south of Butler Boulevard). There is no admission charge for any of
these beaches.
 Fishing: Captain Dave Sipler’s Sportfishing (% 904-642-9546;
www.captdaves.com) is one of several guide services offering char-
ters for small groups. The rate for three people is $325 for a six-
hour fishing trip that goes after tarpon, kingfish, drum, redfish,
flounder, and other species.
 Football: The National Football League’s Jacksonville Jaguars play
their preseason and regular-season home games at Alltel Stadium,
One Alltel Stadium Place (% 904-633-2000; www.jaguars.com).
Prices start at about $35, but single-game tickets can be hard to
come by, depending on the team’s opponent.
 Golf: The Golf Club of Jacksonville, 10440 Tournament Lane 
(% 904-779-2100), has rolling, tree-lined fairways and, with fees
under $25 year-round, is an affordable course. Baymeadows Golf
Club, 7981 Baymeadows Circle W., Jacksonville (% 904-731-5701;
www.baymeadowsgolf.com), offers water hazards on ten holes and
plenty of doglegs. Greens fees run between $41 and $65 year-round.
You can obtain local course information online at www.golf.com
and www.floridagolfing.com, or you can call the Florida Sports

 Kayaking: Kayak Amelia (% 904-321-0697; www.kayakamelia.com)
offers an assortment of guided excursions off the Intracoastal
Waterway. Prices range from $55 to $95.
Shopping
San Marco Square, at San Marco and Atlantic boulevards, south of the
river, is a quaint shopping district in the middle of a stunning residential
area. Shops in meticulously refashioned Mediterranean-revival buildings
sell antiques and home furnishings, in addition to wares such as cloth-
ing, books, and records.
Another worthwhile neighborhood to explore is the Avondale/Riverside
historic district southwest of downtown on St. Johns Avenue between
Talbot Avenue and Boone Park, on the north bank of the river. More than
60 boutiques, antiques stores, art galleries, and cafes line the wide, tree-
lined avenue.
Nearby, the younger set hangs out at Five Points, on Park Street at
Avondale Avenue, where used-record stores, vintage clothiers, coffee
shops, and funky art galleries stay open late.
Part VI: The Great North 
420

The Avenues Mall, 10300 Southside Blvd., Jacksonville (% 904-363-3060),
has 150 stores, including such anchors as Dillard’s and Sears. Jackson-
ville Landing (see listing in “The Top Attractions” earlier in this chapter)
has about 65 shops, plus a number of restaurants.
Living it up after dark
Check the “Weekend” section in the Florida Times-Union (www.
jacksonville.com) on Fridays for up-to-the-minute entertainment
news.
Bars
Jacksonville Landing, 2 Independent Dr., on the St. Johns River (% 904-
353-1188; www.jacksonvillelanding.com), stages periodic festivals
and outdoor rock, jazz, blues, and country concerts. 
Fernandina Beach’s Palace Saloon, at Centre and Second streets (% 904-
261-6320), was Florida’s oldest continuously run watering hole (dating to
the Rockefellers’ and Carnegies’ days), until a fire turned the lights out in
February 1999. It reopened a month later. The bar offers rock or blues on
Friday and Saturday nights. As an added bonus, you’ll hear haunting sto-
ries about a lovable former bartender called “Uncle Charlie.”
Out at Town Center, at the ocean end of Atlantic Boulevard, one of several
popular spots is Ragtime Tavern & Taproom, 207 Atlantic Blvd. (% 904-
241-7877), where local groups play live jazz and blues Wednesday through
Sunday nights. Weekends, especially, the place is really jumping and the
crowd is young, but it’s lively rather than rowdy. Across the street is the
Sun Dog Diner, at 207 Atlantic Blvd. (% 904-241-8221), with nightly
acoustic music and decent diner food. If these don’t fit your mood, walk
around Town Center until you find something you like. The Freebird 
Café, 200 N. 1st St. (% 904-246-2473), is a two-story homage to native
Jacksonville band Lynyrd Skynyrd, run by late lead singer Ronnie Van
Zant’s widow and daughter and featuring live music six nights a week as
well as pretty good nouveau Southern cuisine. Music fans of a different
genre shouldn’t miss Stella’s Piano Café, 1521 Margaret St. (% 904-353-
2900), a restaurant housed in an old Victorian home with a second-floor
piano bar.
Performing arts
The Florida Times Union Center for the Performing Arts, 300 Water St.,
Jacksonville (% 904-630-3900; www.jacksonville.com/community/
tu-center), hosts Broadway shows, big-name concerts, and dance com-
panies. Its Robert E. Jacoby Hall is home to the Jacksonville Symphony
Orchestra (% 904-354-5547), which performs from early fall through
spring.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
A
h, tradition. In For Dummies guides, “The Part of Tens”
is where I serve up plenty of useful and fun information
that I couldn’t ﬁt anywhere else in the book. I point you to
more of Florida’s ﬁnest beaches — the state has over 1,100
miles of coastline, and I highlight the best spots for swimming,
snorkeling and shelling. In addition, I dish out information
about Florida’s unique eats, from crab claws to Key lime pie.

The Top Ten Florida
Beaches
In This Chapter
 Beachcombing and snorkeling in South Florida
 Seeking seashells on the Gulf Coast
 Exploring dunes and tide pools in the Northeast
 Watching for dolphins, turtles, and other wildlife
T
here are two kinds of beaches in Florida: those that the TV ads
trumpet and those that are less-discovered gems. The former
includes some of the places I visit in earlier chapters, such as Miami
Beach, Fort Lauderdale Beach, Daytona Beach, Clearwater Beach, and
so on. The latter are off the beaten path. In many cases they’re in state
parks or preserves.
These off-the-path beaches are less crowded, and vacationers who walk
the extra mile are rewarded with features that are often extraordinary —
towering sand dunes, wind-bent sea oats, powder-fine sand, crystal-clear
water, solitude, good shelling, or a combination of these features.
One of the founders of the Real Florida Beach Club is Dr. Stephen
Leatherman, a professor and geologist at Florida International University.
Several years ago he earned the nickname “Dr. Beach” for his annual rank-
ing of the best stretches of sand in the world, released around Memorial
Day each year. He uses more than 50 criteria (like width, sand softness,
safety, water temperature, wave size, bugs, trash, and amenities) to come
up with his top-ten list of beaches. My method, based on plain-old crea-
ture comforts, is much less scientific. But in many cases, I agree with 
Dr. B. Here are my favorites, listed from south to north.
Bahia Honda State Park (Big Pine Key)
Bahia Honda (that’s deep bay in Spanish) is the only state park in the
lower Keys and one of the rare beaches in this area. Fact is, this is the
only natural beach in the Keys. Can it get any better than brilliant white

sand, turquoise water, and a brisk breeze? The park’s 524 acres include
dunes, coastal mangroves, and hammocks. In addition, the white-sand
beach has deep water close to the shore, making it good for snorkeling.
(You may find lobster and starfish in 3 feet of water.) While you’re here,
climb aboard what’s left of the old Henry Flagler rail line and enjoy the
panorama of the surrounding Keys.
Although the swimming is good here, be careful of the deep water and
the currents off the park.
36850 Overseas Hwy., Big Pine Key. % 305-872-2353. To get there: Located 12 miles
south of Marathon on Overseas Highway (Mile Marker 37.5). Admission: $4 per vehi-
cle and 50¢ per person.
Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Recreation
Area (Miami/Key Biscayne)
This park is where the neon don’t shine and certainly the most secluded
beach in Miami. With its historic lighthouse (originally built in 1825) and
native flora, the park provides a welcome respite from the hustle and
bustle of this international city. But watch out for the raccoons and
other critters that are more than happy to walk off with your picnic
basket, among other things.
1200 Crandon Blvd., Key Biscayne. % 305-361-5811. To get there: From the mainland,
take U.S. 1 south to Rickenbacker Causeway and cross to Key Biscayne, and then
follow the signs. Admission: $5 per car (up to eight people).
Matheson Hammock Park Beach 
(South Miami)
This tranquil beach beckons with an enclosed, man-made lagoon that’s
flushed naturally by the tidal action of adjacent Biscayne Bay. The
bay’s warm waters and a backdrop of a tropical hardwood forest sur-
round the park and are a favorite of many a fashion photographer. It
has a full-service marina, snack bar, and restaurant built into a coral-
rock building.
9610 Old Cutler Rd., South Miami. % 305-665-5475. To get there: Take Highway 826
to North Kendall Drive, continue 33⁄4 miles to Red Road/SW 57th Avenue, turn left on
Red Road, then turn right back onto Kendall and go 3⁄4 mile to Old Cutler Road, turn
right and follow signs. Admission: $4 per car.
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
426

Naples Beach (Naples)
Many Florida cities and towns have beaches, but few are as lovely as the
gorgeous 10-mile strip that runs in front of Naples’s famous Millionaires’
Row. You don’t have to be rich to wander its length, peer at the mansions,
and stroll on historic Naples Pier to catch a sunset over the Gulf. 
25 12th Ave South, Naples. % 239-213-3062. To get there: Go west on 5th Avenue
South and turn left at 2nd Street South, which becomes Gordon Drive. Turn right onto
12th Avenue South. Admission: Free.
Cayo Costa State Park (Captiva Island)
These days, deserted tropical islands with great beaches are scarce in
Florida, but this 2,132-acre barrier strip of sand, pine forests, mangrove
swamps, oak hammocks, and grasslands provides a genuine get-away-
from-it-all experience. Access is only by boat from nearby Gasparilla,
Pine, and Captiva islands. 
P.O. Box 1150, Boca Grande. % 941-964-0375. To get there: Located directly south of
Boca Grande. Accessible only by passenger ferry or private boat. Reservations are
required on the ferry service. Call Tropic Star of Pine Island at % 239-283-0015.
Admission: $1 per person.
Siesta Beach (Sarasota)
This beach is short, just a quarter of a mile long, but it’s also 500 feet
wide. The tide has pounded the sand granules for so long that they feel
like fine flour beneath your toes. (This is the kind of sand that squeaks like
snow when you walk on it.) By Gulf of Mexico standards, it has good swim-
ming (the water is a little on the warm side and very tame by Atlantic
standards, but there’s virtually no undertow). You’re going to have a hard
time finding a better place to chill out. Just sit at the water’s edge and let
the small waves lap at your legs. Lifeguards add to the safety level. Siesta
Beach gets a little crowded with families at times (it’s Sarasota’s most
popular beach), but there’s a 700-car parking lot, and the price is right.
948 Beach Rd., Siesta Key (near Sarasota). % 941-861-2150. To get there: Heading
west on State Road 72, cross U.S. 41 and the Intracoastal Waterway. At the road’s
end, turn right at Midnight Pass and follow the signs. Admission: Free.
Fort DeSoto Park (St. Petersburg)
Here, you’ll get a good tan and a history lesson that goes well beyond the
latest, trashy summer page turner. At Fort DeSoto Park, you not only
have 1,136 acres of five interconnected islands and 3 miles of unfettered
Chapter 22: The Top Ten Florida Beaches 427

beaches, but a fort, for which the park was named, that’s listed on the
National Register of Historic Places, nature trails, fishing piers, a 2.25-mile
canoe trail, and spectacular views of Tampa Bay and the Gulf. 
3500 Pinellas Bayway South, St. Petersburg.% 727-582-2267. To get there: From the
north, take I-275 south to exit 17 (Pinellas Bayway). Go west to the second stoplight.
Turn left (south). This will lead you directly into the park. Admission: Free.
Caladesi Island State Park (Dunedin)
This 3-mile-long island is among the best shelling locations in Florida.
The no-vehicles policy means that you don’t need to worry about noise
or air pollution. It’s secluded with soft sand, sea grass, small dunes, and
a variety of birds, including blue herons. You may have the opportunity
to see the resident dolphins performing off the beach, and in summer,
you’ll probably see the crawl marks left by nesting loggerhead turtles.
To get there, use the ferry at Honeymoon Island State Recreation Area
(see Chapter 15).
3 Causeway Blvd., Dunedin. % 727-469-5918. To get there: From Clearwater, go north
on U.S. 19, and then west on Curlew Road, which leads to Honeymoon Island and
the ferry. Admission: $4 per vehicle, plus $7 adults, $3.50 kids 4–12 for the ferry to the
island.
Washington Oaks State Park (Palm Coast)
This park gets lost in the tourist shuffle between Daytona Beach to the
south and St. Augustine to the north, which is all the better for those who
visit. Originally part of an early-19th-century plantation, the 400-acre park
reaches from the Atlantic Ocean to the Matanzas River. A hammock and
marsh are on one side, but a beautifully rocky beach across the way pres-
ents my favorite picture. The waves’ constant pounding on the coquina
rocks gives the beach a ghostly, other-world-like orange hue.
The depressions in the rock and tide pools are neat places to search for
mussels, limpets, and barnacles. Although the rocks make swimming a
little hazardous, a short walk to either side gets you clear of them.
6400 Oceanshore Blvd., Palm Coast (about 20 miles south of St. Augustine). % 386-
446-6780. To get there: From Daytona Beach, take A1A north 48 miles to the park
entrance. Admission: $3.25 per car.
Little Talbot Island State Park (Jacksonville)
Actually, this 2,500-acre park is on Little and Big Talbot Islands. Salt
marshes, hammocks, and Atlantic dunes (these are tall puppies) comple-
ment more than 4 miles of gorgeous beaches, marshes, and centuries-old
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
428

live oaks. Fiddler crabs scurry about the beach, and lucky visitors get a
glimpse of the park’s river otters.
This is another place to see a rocky beach carved by erosion, as well as
plenty of driftwood formations. On the trails and observation platform,
you’ll see some of the nearly 200 species of land, wading, and sea birds
that come to the island. Despite the major city just south of the park and
a large Navy base, this is one of Florida’s least-spoiled beaches.
12157 Heckscher Dr., Jacksonville. % 904-251-2320. To get there: From Jacksonville,
follow Highway A1A 20 miles northeast. Admission: $3.25 per car.

Chapter 23
Ten or More of Florida’s
Favorite Foods
In This Chapter
 Sampling the seafood
 Dining the Latin way
 Eating true Key lime pie
I
n this chapter, I cheat — twice.
First, I list more than ten items here.
Second, while some of these dishes are true Florida specialties, I remind
you that this state is a melting pot. So much of the food that you find on
restaurant menus or in the supermarket is someone else’s recipe. Most
of what’s presented as Cracker cuisine (think grits, and such) has roots
in Alabama, Georgia, or some other Southern state that ends in a vowel.
Our food also shows a substantial (and delicious) Cuban and Latin influ-
ence, as well as a Caribbean flair.
The local cuisine is sometimes called Floribbean. I don’t think any self-
respecting Cracker, Cuban, or Caribbean islander would ever concoct a
name like that. The culprit was a trio of froufrou chefs who were tired of
answering questions like “Is the Early Bird Special Florida’s version of,
say, Pan Asian cuisine?” The result: a fusion of Floridian, Caribbean and
Latin ingredients that, while extremely tasty, doesn’t come cheap.
I steer clear of Floribbean in this part and instead deal with some older
and more conventional staples because they give you a far better feel for
the foods you’ll see on menus or in grocers’ aisles throughout the state.
Ambrosia
There’s something whimsical about the name and this salad. It blends
mandarin oranges, pineapple, coconut, marshmallows, and sour cream
into a mouth-watering explosion of taste.

Citrus Fruits
Winter is the big season for Florida oranges, grapefruit, and tangerines.
Nevertheless, you can find them, or their imported cousins, sold year-
round at roadside stands or grocery stores and supermarkets. Although
they aren’t citrus, strawberries are another sweet and very popular win-
tertime treat.
Conch
These critters live in those shells that you find in souvenir shops, take
back home, and (after a carafe of wine) put to your ear and swear that
you can hear the ocean.
Conch (pronounced konk) can be tough, so cooks whack the heck out of
it with a tenderizing mallet before serving it. That’s if you want it in
chowder or fried, two of the most common ways conch is prepared.
Conch fritters are another favorite. Although conch is also served in
salads, it tends to be grainy and not real sweet, unless you have the
courage to try it raw. Those brave enough find a faint almond flavor.
Cuban Cuisine
Florida had a sizable Hispanic population even before Fidel Castro, but
since 1959 the population has increased dramatically. The Tampa and
Miami areas have large Latin bases — the reason for such a strong
Cuban/Spanish influence in our food.
To sample a day’s worth of Cuban delights, begin at breakfast with a
wedge of hot, buttered Cuban bread dunked in a cup of café con leche —
strong coffee cut with milk. Things get downright funky after that.
Specialties include frijoles negros (black beans), arroz con pollo (chicken
and yellow rice), boliche (tender, sausage-stuffed beef), Cuban mojo-roast
pork, salteado (chorizo, onion, and pepper stew), and deviled crab with
hot sauce. Arguably, though, it doesn’t get any better than paella — rice
buried under a blanket of treats that may include mussels, clams, shrimp,
scallops, lobster, oysters, crab claws, chicken, and/or pork. If you have
room, try your luck with flan, egg custard dripping in caramel sauce.
Divinity
Divinity should be called dentists’ delight. It’s instant tooth decay (but,
oh, what fun you’re going to have getting there). This chewy candy is
composed of a ton of sugar, corn syrup, egg whites, vanilla, and pecans.
Chapter 23: Ten or More of Florida’s Favorite Foods 431

Florida Lobster
Like conch, Florida lobster tends to be grainy and not very sweet, espe-
cially in inland restaurants. It’s also commonly served broiled with
butter. Many places cheat and give you margarine.
My advice: Leave the lobsters to the Mainers or Caribbean islanders.
Grits
Like other Southerners, real backwoods Floridians know “gree-its” is a
two-syllable word. Grits are corn, coarsely ground to a slurry. The trick
is to eat them before they congeal into something that resembles a
hockey puck. Salt, pepper, and butter are allowed. Some folks like to add
cheese, but in a real Cracker diner adding cheese will get you almost as
many disapproving stares as using sugar — a common mistake made by
Northerners who mistake grits for Cream O’ Wheat.
Key Lime Pie
If it’s green, send it back to the kitchen. The real stuff is yellow, thanks to
the backyard fruit grown throughout much of South Florida. Pretenders
use the wrong limes or — and this is true sacrilege — green food color-
ing. Key lime pie usually comes with a graham-cracker or regular crust
and is usually made with condensed milk (not low-fat). This dessert is
tangy and tart and sometimes has a dollop of whipped cream and a slice
of lime on top. One variation uses meringue.
Mullet
No, I don’t mean the much lambasted hair style, if you could call it that,
made popular by the likes of Billy Ray Cyrus and described by many as
“business in the front, party in the back,” although you may spot many
of those around certain parts of Florida. This local fish has dark, fatty
meat and a pretty strong flavor when compared to white-meat fish.
Mullet is more common in down-home, shorts-are-welcome restaurants
than in the fancier establishments. It’s usually served smoked or fried
with a light cornmeal wrapping. The roe (fish eggs) is often sent to the
Orient, where it’s considered a delicacy.
Seafood
Florida’s Gulf and Atlantic coasts and its inland waters cast forth a delight-
ful menu of marine cuisine. Depending on the time of year and your loca-
tion, you can feast on Apalachicola oysters, Fernandina Beach shrimp, 
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
432

St. Johns River blue crabs, Florida Bay lobsters and conch, Gulf shrimp,
and Cedar Key clams. Grouper, mahimahi, largemouth bass, speckled
perch, and trout are also menu regulars.
Stone Crab Claws
In season from mid-October until May, this catch is the crab world’s
answer to Maine lobster, a sweet treat that results in a heck of a lot more
meat and a lot less work than if you choose blue crabs. Steamed or
boiled, these claws are close to heaven when dipped in butter. They’re
also at the top of the price chart.

his handy section is where I condense all the practical and pertinent infor-
mation — from airline phone numbers to mailbox locations — you need to
make sure that you have a successful and stress-free vacation. And if you believe
there is no such thing as too much preparation, I give you some additional
resources to check out.
Florida A to Z: Facts
at Your Fingertips
AAA
If you belong to the American Automobile
Association, you can contact your local
office for maps and optimum driving
directions or call % 800-222-1134 and
ask to be transferred to the office nearest
your location. Some other auto clubs also
have service agreements with AAA, so
ask your club whether this is the case
before you leave. You can get information
online at www.aaa.com.
American Express
You can reach the card company’s Travel
Service offices nationally by calling 
% 800-297-3429. 
Banks
Banks are generally open Monday
through Friday from 9 a.m. to 3 or 4 p.m.
(Drive-in windows usually are open until 6
p.m. on Friday.) ATMs honoring Cirrus,
Honor, Plus, and other systems are com-
monly found in most malls, banks, and
convenience stores, such as 7-Eleven and
Circle K, as well as at larger tourist attrac-
tions, resorts, and shopping venues. To
locate an ATM near your hotel in Florida,
contact either of the two most popular
networks: Cirrus (% 800-424-7787;
www.mastercard.com/cardholder
services/atm) and Plus (% 800-843-
7587; www.visa.com/atms).
Credit Cards
American Express, MasterCard, and Visa
are universally accepted in all but a few
places. Carte Blanche, Diner’s Club, and
Discover are also accepted in many loca-
tions. We list the accepted credit cards
under hotel and restaurant entries.
Most credit card companies have an
emergency toll-free number to call if your
card is lost or stolen; they may be able to
wire you a cash advance immediately or
deliver an emergency credit card in a day
or two. Call the following emergency
numbers in the United States: American
Express % 800-221-7282 (for cardholders
and traveler’s check holders); MasterCard
% 800-307-7309 or 636-722-7111; Visa 
% 800-847-2911 or 410-581-9994. For
other credit cards, call the toll-free
number directory at % 800-555-1212.
Emergencies
All of Florida uses 911 as the emergency
number for police, fire departments,

Florida for Dummies, 3rd Edition 
436
ambulances, and other critical needs.
There’s also a 24-hour, toll-free number 
for the Poison Control Center (% 800-282-
3171).
For less urgent requests, call % 800-647-
9284, a number sponsored by the Florida
Tourism Industry Marketing Corporation,
the state’s tourism promotion board. Its
operators speak more than 100 languages
and can provide general directions, as well
as help with lost travel papers and credit
cards, medical problems, accidents,
money transfers, airline confirmations, and
much more.
Information
Visit Florida, 661 E. Jefferson St., Suite 300,
Tallahassee, FL 32301 (% 888-735-2872;
www.flausa.com), is the state’s official
tourism office. You can order a copy of
Great Florida Getaways and the Florida
Vacation Guide plus brochures on golf,
fishing, camping, and biking.
See “Fast Facts” in the destination chapters
for local tourist information sources. Also,
see “Where to Get More Information,” later
in this appendix.
To get local telephone information, dial 
% 411.
Liquor Laws
Florida law requires you to be 21 years old
or older before you can buy or consume
alcohol. And the state is very strict about
enforcing the law. You can get into
parimutuels and bars where food is served
at an earlier age. Note: Liquor stores in
Florida are open Monday through Saturday,
except Election Day. Depending on the
region, they’re closed all or part of Sunday.
Mail
If you want to receive mail on your vaca-
tion and you aren’t sure of your address,
your mail can be sent to you, in your name,
care of General Delivery at the main post
office of the city or region where you
expect to be (see “Fast Facts” in the desti-
nation chapters). You can get the address
and phone number of any post office in the
area that you visit by calling % 800-275-
8777.
Maps
AAA and other auto clubs offer good
Florida maps to members. You can also find
maps in bookstores and libraries in your
hometown. Most Florida convenience
stores sell local maps for $3 to $5. If you
rent a car, ask the rental agent for a local
map — many of the agencies carry thor-
ough ones. You can also request maps from
many of the tourist information bureaus
listed in the “Fast Facts” sections of some
destination chapters. Web sites such as
MapQuest (www.mapquest.com) or com-
puter software such as Microsoft Streets &
Trips are other good sources for maps.
Police
In any emergency, call 911. If you have a
cellular phone and need highway help, dial
*FHP for the Florida Highway Patrol.
Restrooms
Foreign visitors often complain that public
toilets are hard to find, but Florida is no
worse than most U.S. destinations. True,
there are no restrooms on the streets, but
you can usually find one in a bar, restau-
rant, hotel, museum, department store,
convenience store, attraction, fast-food
barn, or service station — and it will prob-
ably be clean. In particular, Mobil service
stations have made a public pledge to pro-
vide exceptionally clean bathrooms, most
decorated with homey touches. Note,
however, that restaurants and bars in
resorts or heavily visited areas may
reserve their restrooms for the use of their
patrons. Some establishments display a

Appendix: Quick Concierge 437
notice that toilets are for the use of
patrons only. You can ignore this sign or,
better yet, avoid arguments by paying for a
cup of coffee or a soft drink, which will
qualify you as a patron. Within the theme
parks, restrooms will be clearly marked on
the handout park maps.
Safety
Stay alert and remain aware of your imme-
diate surroundings. Putting your valuables
in a safe-deposit box (inquire at your
hotel’s front desk) is a good idea, although
nowadays many hotels are equipped with
in-room safes. Keep a close eye on your
valuables when you’re in a public place —
restaurant, theater, and even an airport
terminal. Renting a locker is always prefer-
able to leaving your valuables in the trunk
of your car, even in the theme-park lots. Be
cautious, even in the parks, and avoid car-
rying large amounts of cash in a backpack
or fanny pack. If you rent a car, carefully
read the safety instructions that the rental
company provides. Never stop in a dark
area, and remember that children should
never ride in the front seat of a car
equipped with air bags.
Smoking
On July 1, 2003, a constitutional amend-
ment banned smoking in Florida’s public
workplaces, including restaurants and
bars that serve food. Stand-alone bars that
serve virtually no food are exempt, as are
designated smoking rooms in hotels and
motels. Even so, hotel accommodations for
smokers are evaporating; the same goes
for smoking areas in many public places,
such as stadiums. Some of the major
attractions do provide areas for smokers
(although they’re usually outdoors).
Taxes
Florida’s state sales tax is 6 percent, and
many municipalities add an additional 1
percent or more to that. In general, you
can expect to add 11 to 14 percent to your
hotel bill and 6 to 7 percent to most every-
thing else — except groceries and health
supplies or medical services. If you rent a
car, be prepared to fork over an additional
20 percent or more in taxes.
Time Zone
Florida, for the most part, is on Eastern
standard time from late fall until mid-spring
and then on Eastern daylight saving time
(one hour later) for the rest of the year.
That means, when it’s noon here, it’s 7 a.m.
in Honolulu, 8 a.m. in Anchorage, 9 a.m. in
Vancouver and Los Angeles, 11 a.m. in
Winnipeg and New Orleans, and 5 p.m. in
London. The Panhandle (not reviewed in
this book), however, operates on central
time, which is one hour behind the rest of
the state. So when it’s noon in Miami, it’s
11 a.m. in Pensacola.
Weather
To check weather forecasts online, go to
www.weathercenter.com, or surf over
to the National Weather Service’s site at
www.nws.noaa.gov. You also can get
information by watching the Weather
Channel (www.weather.com). Local fore-
cast contacts are listed under “Fast Facts”
in the destination chapters.
