•
Consider non-terminal A, production A  , & token t 
•
T[A,t] =  in two cases: 
 
•
If  * t  
–  can derive a t in the first position 
– We say that t  First() 
 
•
If A   and  *  and S *  A t   
– Useful if stack has A, input is t, and A cannot derive t 
– In this case only option is to get rid of A (by deriving ) 
• Can work only if t can follow A in at least one derivation 
– We say t  Follow(A)

Definition 
          First(X) = { t | X * t}  { | X * } 
 
Algorithm sketch: 
1.
First(t) = { t } 
2.
  First(X)    
•
if X   
•
if X  A1 … An and   First(Ai) for 1  i  n 
3.
First()  First(X) if X  A1 … An   
–
and   First(Ai) for 1  i  n

• Recall the grammar  
    E  T X                               X  + E |   
    T  ( E ) | int Y                   Y  * T | 
