This lecture deals with the fundamentals of spread spectrum communications in general and CDMA in
particular.
1
Introduction
Spread spectrum communications were originally developed for military purposes to capitilize on their desir-
able antijam (AJ) and low probability of intercept (LPI) properties. Since 1980s and early 1990s, though,
application of the same in civilian communications has been worked upon. CDMA, based on spread spec-
trum communications technology, has been recognized as a viable alternative to FDMA and TDMA. The
development of 2G (e.g. IS-95) and 3G (e.g. cdma2000) CDMA cellular systems is consequence of this.
2
Fundamentals
Spread spectrum communications consist of mainly two elements.
(i) Spreading Spreading refers to the expansion of the expansion of the signal bandwidth well beyond
what is required to transmit the data. This causes the signal power level to appear almost like noise.
(ii) Pseudorandomness The band spread is achieved by usind a spreading code, which is essentially a
preudorandom (PN) sequence. This sequence spreads the bandwidth of the signal and makes it appear like a
random noise to all receivers other than the intended receiver. The intended receiver posseses a synchronized
replica of the transmitter’s PN sequence allowing signal recovery at the receiver.
Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA).
The PN spreading sequence is called a code. The random nature of the codes and the resultant independence
of the codes of diﬀerent transmitters can be exploited to allow multiple users to access the same channel re-
sources simultaneously to transmit information. This multiple accessing scheme is known as Code Division
Multiple Access (CDMA).
Advantages
Some of the advantages of a CDMA system could be enlisted as below:
1

(i) Increased capacity due low average transmit power requirement.
(ii) Increased privacy and security due to its low probability of interception and anti-jamming properties.
This is on account of the fact that the PSD of the signal almost resembles noise.
(ii) Increased resistence to multipath fading.
(iii) Lower probability of call dropping due to ’soft’ handoﬀimplementation wherein more than one base
station monitor a mobile simultaneously.
(iv) Enhanced coverage characteristic and simpliﬁed cell planning since no time frequency sharing scheme
involved.
There are two ways to implement a spread spectrum CDMA system.
(i) Direct Sequence CDMA This implementation achieves bandspread by using a PN sequence to intro-
duce rapid and random phase transitions into the carrier containing the data. This is employed in the cellular
systems. The receiver has knowledge about the transmitter’s direct sequence code at all times.
(ii) Frequency hopping CDMA This implementation spreads the spectrum by using the PN sequence
to (pseudo) randomly hop the carrier frequency through a large band.
This is employed in some of the
prototypes having proposed applications in the U-NII band and in adhoc mobile networks devices.
(e.g.
BLUETOOTH). The receiver, in this case has the knowledge of the hop sequence of the transmitter at all
times.
Since DS/CDMA is widely used in cellular systems, the analysis from now on focusses on it.

General Analysis

Transmission
3.1.1
BPSK transmission
In BPSK transmission the incoming data bit stream is modulated by a unique signature waveform. A BPSK
modulated signal waveform can be represented as
s(t) =
√
2Pc(t)b(t)cos(ωct + φ)
(1)
where c(t) is the code or signature waveform, b(t) is the data bit waveform, P is the transmitted signal power,
ωc is the carrier frequency and φ is the phase.

where

signal. ψ(t) is the chip waveform, time limited to [0,Tc] and

One of the popularly used chip waveforms is

The processing gain of a DS/CDMA system is deﬁned as
N = T

(7)
This signal processing is depicted in ﬁg(1).
3.1.2
QPSK transmission
In QPSK transmission, the inphase and quadrature bit streams are modulated by unique and diﬀerent signa-
ture vectors. The QPSK modulated spread signal waveform can be represented as
s(t) =
√
PbI(t)cI(t)cos(ωct + φ) +
√
PbQ(t)cQ(t)cos(ωct + φ)

Receiver
3.2.1
BPSK receiver
A matched ﬁlte based BPSK receiver is shown in ﬁg(2).
For BPSK, the received signal can be represented as
r(t) =
√
2P b(t)c(t)cos(ωct + φ) + η(t)
(12)
where η(t) is the AWGN characterized by N(0, N0/2), N0/2 is the PSD of the noise.
Consider a matched ﬁlter receiver for the received signal.
The output of the matched ﬁlter, sampled at time instant T is given as,
y =
Z (i+1)T
iT
c(t)cos(ωct + φ)r(t)dt
=
r
P
2 Tbi + η
(13)
The other double frequency terms go to zero on integration.
η =
Z (i+1)T
iT
η(t)c(t)cos(ωct + φ)dt
(14)
is a gaussian random variable ∼N(0, N0T
4 ) and therefore y ∼N(±
q
P
2 T, N0T
4 ).
Scaling the output of the matched ﬁlter y by
q
2
T , the output takes the valus such that y ∼N(±

PT, N0
2 ).
Therefore the probability of bit error,
Pb = Q(

)
(15)
where Eb = PT.
3.2.2
QPSK Receiver
A matched ﬁlter based QPSK receiver is shown in ﬁg(3).
In it the received signal is subjected to inde-
pendent demodulation and detection for the in-phase and quadrature carrier components as shown. The
remaining of the details remain same as in BPSK.

Detailed Analysis
4.1
Multiuser BPSK CDMA system
Consider a CDMA system in which multiple users acess the channel simultaneously. The transmitted signal
of each user is BPSK modulated.
The transmitted signal of one such user j can be represented as
sj(t) =
p
2Pjcj(t)bj(t)cos(ωct + θj)
(16)
where

The received signal at a receiver can be represented as
r(t) =

j=1
p
2Pjcj(t −τj)bj(t −τj)cos(ωct + φj) + η(t)
(20)
φj = θj −ωcτj
(21)
where η(t) ∼N(0, N0
2 ), τjε[0, 1] is the time delay suﬀered by signal of user j, and θjε[0, 2π] is the phase
variation suﬀered by signal of user j.
In general, the signals are received with diﬀerent delays and diﬀerent power levels. This is shown in (4).

4.1.1
Single user reception
Let us ﬁrst consider reception in a single user environment. At the receiver is a matched ﬁlter for the sole
user in the system.
The output of the matched ﬁlter sampled at time T is given as
z1 =

where we introduce the continuous partial cross correlation functions,
Rj,1(τ) =

(24)
ˆ
Rj,1(τ) =
Z T

cj(t −τ)c1(t)dt

0 ≤τ ≤T
(26)
The premise for the above terms is that in one bit interval or window of the desired user, there would be
eﬀectively two bits of every interferer. The implicit assumption is that the signals of the interferers are delayed
by not more than one bit interval. The same is depicted in ﬁg(5).

4.1.1 Case of synchronous users
For the case of a synchronous system, φj = 0 ∀j and τj = 0 ∀j.
So each interferer contributes only one term.

The system constraint is K ≤N i.e.
the number of users in the system should be less than the length
of the signature sequence.
(a) When orthogonal codes are used
cjT ci = δji
(29)
where δji is the Kronecker delta. Then,

(31)
(b) When random codes are used
cj, j = 1, 2, ..., k are random binary vectors.
The error probabilities can be calculated in two steps.
Step 1: Fix the codes and bits of other users. Then calculate the conditional probability of error for syn-
chronous users with ﬁxed data bits. Let it be represented as,
Pb,1({Rj,1}, {b0
j})
Step 2: Average over {Rj,1} and {b(0)
j }to ﬁnd Pb,1
For ﬁxed {Rj,1} and {b(0)
j } ,

This is not easily tractable. So, we invoke the Gaussian approximation based on the assumptions that Pj = P

4.2.2 Case of asynchronous users
Now, τj ̸= 0 and φj ̸= 0.
So, at the receiver, each interferer now has two terms.
Recall, the sampled
output of the matched ﬁlter at the reciever is,
z1 =
r
P1
2 Tb(0)
1
+
k
X
j=2
r
Pj
2 TIj,1(bj, τj, φj) + η1
(40)
where, Ij,1 is the interference that user causes to user 1, and is given by,
Ij,1(bj, τj, φj) = 1
T [b(−1)
j
Rj,1(τj) + b(0)
j
ˆ
Rj,1(τj)]cos(φj)
(41)
bjε[b(−1)
j
, b(0)
j ]
Assume perfect power control condition for all users i.e.Pj = P ∀j.
10

Also,
k
X
j=2
Ij,1(bj, τj, φj) = I1(b, τ, φ)
(42)
where,
b = (b2, b3, ..., bk)
(43)
τ = (τ2, τ3, ..., τk)
(44)
φ = (φ2, φ3, ..., φk)
(45)
So,
z1 =
r
P
2 Tb(0)
1
+
k
X
j=2
r
Pj
2 TIj,1(bj, τj, φj) + η1
(46)
Now, for ﬁxed b, τ φ, considering the case when ’-1’ is transmitted,
Pb,1/b(0)
1
=−1 = P{z1 > 0/b1(0) = −1}
= P[η1 +
r
P
2 T(−1 + I1(b, τ, φ)) > 0]
= Q
r
2Eb
N0
(1 −I1(b, τ, φ))

(47)
Consider the case when ’+1’ is transmitted,
Pb,1/b(0)
1
=+1 = P{z1 > 0/b1(0) = +1}
= P[η1 +
r
P
2 T(+1 + I1(b, τ, φ)) > 0]
= Q
r
2Eb
N0
(1 + I1(b, τ, φ))

(48)
So, the error probabilities are not symmetric, as the interference is not symmetric.
11

The average probability of error, again, is,
ˆ
Pb,1 = 1
2Eb,τ,φ[Pb,1/b1(0)=−1] + 1
2Eb,τ,φ[Pb,1/b1(0)=+1]
Calculating the expectations is again non-trivial and hence it is diﬃcult to reach to exact values. However
good bounds and approximations exist. ( Refer “Error probability for DS/SS multiple access communications,
Part I - Upper and lower bound” , Pursley, Sarwate and Stark, IEEE TranCom, May 1982)
We apply the Gaussian approximation here. So we model I1(b, τ, φ as a Gaussian random variable. The
other assumptions are, (a) b(m)
j
and b(n)
i
are independent ∀i ̸= j, m ̸= n (b) τj and τi are independent ∀i ̸= j,
and τ uniform in [0,T] (c) φj and φi are independent ∀i ̸= j and φ uniform in [0, 2π]
Based on these assumptions, we need to ﬁnd the mean and the variance of I1(b, τ, φ).
E[Ij,1(bj, τ, φ)] = 0

Note that the performance of a matched ﬁlter receiver depends critically on the value of σ2
j,1 which depends on
properties of chipwaveform or code sequences. Increase in SNR doesnot necessarily increase performance.So
codes with good cross correlation properties ( ∼0) are desired. m-sequences and gold - sequences are examples
of the same. ( Refer “Error probability for DS/SS multiple access communications, Geranitis and Pursley,
IEEE TranCom, May 1982)
Error probability for asynchronous users with random codes
