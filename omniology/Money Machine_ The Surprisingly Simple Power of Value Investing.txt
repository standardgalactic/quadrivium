FOREWORD
M
ost people who buy and sell stocks have heard the story of 
the two finance professors who see a shiny $100 bill on the 
sidewalk. One professor is tempted, but the other cautions that if it 
were real, someone would have picked it up already. The lesson is 
supposed to be that, in the stock market, anything that looks like 
free money is an illusion. Some people actually believe this—I do 
not. Money Machine: The Surprisingly Simple Power of Value Investing 
makes clear why others should not believe it either.
	
Professor Smith reminds us of the South Sea Bubble, when 
even Isaac Newton bought stock in companies that lacked a com-
pelling story but touted a whimsical expectation of reselling the 
stock at a higher price to an even bigger fool. More recently, inves-
tors bought into the same ill-founded illusions with Beanie Babies, 
gold, and dot-coms. At the other end of the spectrum—from greed 
to fear—the 2002 and 2009 stock market crashes left suitcases full 
of $100 bills on the sidewalks.
	
So, how does an investor distinguish a bubble from a bar-
gain? Both Professor Smith and I believe the answer is through value 
investing: thinking about the intrinsic value of a stock and not about 
the stock’s old price or a guess of its future price.
	
Professor Smith clearly explains the two keys to being a suc-
cessful value investor.
	
First, no one is able to predict how prices will wiggle and jig-
gle as fear and greed batter the markets. But you can think of stocks 
as money machines.  Think of the cash you will receive if you own 
the machine (and leave yourself a margin of error).
	
Second, do not let lust or panic sway your investment deci-
sions. Many investors had a hard time sitting on the sidelines when 
Yahoo, AOL, and other internet companies soared during the dot-

xii      Foreword
com boom in the late 1990s, but value investors did exactly that, 
they sat. Many investors could not think about buying stocks when 
prices fell more than 40 percent between 2000 and 2002 and, again, 
between 2007 and 2009. Value investors did exactly that; they 
bought because those were buying opportunities of a lifetime.
Professor Smith also explains how you could find bargains even 
in ordinary times—for example, in companies that are out of fash-
ion and in closed-end funds selling at a discount. Some may think it 
counterintuitive that companies with analysts who are pessimistic 
usually do better than companies with analysts who are optimistic, 
or that stocks that are booted out of the Dow usually do better than 
the stocks that replace them . . . but not a value investor.
	
Let others make decisions driven by fear and greed, and 
thank them silently for the opportunities they give you—for the 
$100 bills they leave on the sidewalk. If you want to be a great inves-
tor, look for these $100 bills and do not be afraid to pick them up off 
the ground!
	
This is another great, well-thought-out book by Professor 
Smith that I enjoyed reading, and you will too.

INTRODUCTION
The stock market is filled with individuals who know the price of 
­everything, but the value of nothing.
—Philip Fisher
I 
made it through Yale graduate school on a $200 monthly sti-
pend—$100 for rent in a nasty part of New Haven and $100 for 
food, secondhand clothes, and not much else. My shoes were held 
together with duct tape, and dinners at the end of the month were 
often bread and orange juice, sometimes bread and water. I started 
teaching economics at Yale in 1971, a newly minted PhD with a 
three-month-old son, $12,000 annual income, and less than $100 in 
the bank.
The Yale economics department asked students what courses 
they would like added to the curriculum and the runaway winners 
were Marx and the stock market. I wasn’t interested in Marx, but 
the chair of my thesis committee was James Tobin, who would be 
awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, in part for his analysis of fi-
nancial markets. So, I volunteered to create a stock market course 
and asked Jim to recommend a textbook. His immediate answer was 
The Theory of Investment Value, by John Burr Williams, which had 
been published more than thirty years earlier, in 1938, and was not 
really a textbook. It was Williams’s PhD thesis and had been re-
jected by several publishers for being overly academic (it had alge-
braic symbols!). Harvard University Press published it, but Williams 
had to pay part of the printing cost himself.
Tobin’s recommendation was inspired. John Burr Williams and 
Benjamin Graham laid the foundation for value investing—­assessing 
stocks based on the cash they generate rather than trying to ­predict 

xiv      Introduction
zigs and zags in stock prices. Their way of thinking is central to the 
success of many legendary value investors, including Warren Buffett, 
Laurence Tisch, and Michael Larson.
I didn’t use Williams’s treatise as a textbook but, over and over, I 
have relied on the insights I learned from Tobin, Williams, Graham, 
and Buffett. I’ve been investing and teaching investing for more 
than forty years now, and I’ve learned that some lessons are well 
worth learning, others are not. Their lessons are worth learning.
Financial markets are always changing, but underneath these in-
novations are some core concepts like present value, leverage, 
hedging, efficient markets, and the conservation of value. These 
enduring principles are more important than temporary details. 
­Investing is not a multiple-choice test that can be passed by mem-
orizing soon-obsolete facts like the name of the largest brokerage 
firm or the number of stocks traded on the New York Stock 
­Exchange.
The great British economist John Maynard Keynes wrote:
The master-economist must possess a rare combination of 
gifts. He must be mathematician, historian, statesman, phi-
losopher—in some degree.  He must understand symbols 
and speak in words. He must contemplate the particular in 
terms of the general, and touch abstract and concrete in the 
same flight of thought. He must study the present in the 
light of the past for the purposes of the future. No part of 
man’s nature or his institutions must lie entirely outside his 
regard.
The same could be said of the master investor. How can we calculate 
present values without mathematics? How can we gauge uncertainty 
without statistics? However, a deep understanding of investments 
requires recognition of the limitations of mathematical and statisti-
cal models, no matter how scientific they appear, no matter if they 
were developed by Nobel laureates.
Tobin came to Yale in 1950 when the economics department de-

Introduction        xv
cided that it needed a mathematical economist. Yes, one mathemat-
ical economist among a faculty of perhaps sixty. When Tobin retired, 
every Yale economist was more mathematical than Tobin had been 
in 1950, some frighteningly so. Mathematicians had become the 
gods of economics, and knowing nothing about the real world was 
almost a badge of honor. When Gérard Debreu was awarded the 
Nobel Prize in Economics in 1983, reporters tried to get him to say 
something about Ronald Reagan’s economic policies. Debreu firmly 
refused to say anything, some suspected because he didn’t know or 
care—and was proud of it.
Mathematical models are too often revered more for their ele-
gance than their realism. Too many economists assume whatever is 
needed—no matter how preposterous—in order to make their mod-
els mathematically tractable. I listened to a finance lecture at Yale 
where a future Nobel laureate began his talk with a brutally candid 
statement: “Making whatever assumptions are needed, here is my 
proof.”
This cavalier attitude may work great for publishing academic 
papers that no one reads, but it is a recipe for disaster on Wall Street 
where real people risk real money and may literally be betting the 
bank based on a model concocted out of convenience.
At about the same time I heard this lecture, the New Statesman 
gave an award for this definition of an economist:
An inhabitant of cloud-cuckoo land; one knowledgeable in 
an obsolete art; a harmless academic drudge whose theories 
and laws are but mere puffs of air in face of the anarchy of 
banditry, greed, and corruption which holds sway in the pe-
cuniary affairs of the real world.
In recent years, the inhabitants of cloud-cuckoo land have been 
joined on the economics pedestal by new gods: number crunchers.
When I first started teaching investments, computers were just 
becoming popular, and my wife’s grandfather (“Popsie”) knew that 
my PhD thesis used Yale’s big computer to estimate an extremely 

xvi      Introduction
complicated economic model. Popsie had bought and sold stocks 
for decades. He even had his own desk at his broker’s office where 
he could trade gossip and stocks.
Nonetheless, he wanted advice from a twenty-one-year-old kid 
who had no money and had never bought a single share of stock in 
his life—me—because I worked with computers. “Ask the computer 
what it thinks of Schlumberger,” he’d say. “Ask the computer what it 
thinks of GE.”
Things haven’t changed much. Too many people still think that 
computers are infallible. No matter what kind of garbage we put in, 
computers will spit out gospel. Nope. Garbage in, garbage out. As 
with theoretical models based on convenient assumptions, statisti-
cal patterns uncovered by torturing data are worse than worthless. 
They have bankrupted investors large and small.
Mathematics is not enough. Statistics is not enough. Master in-
vestors need common sense; they need to understand human na-
ture, and they need to control their emotions.
FEAR AND GREED
I have a friend, Blake, who netted a million dollars in cash when he 
downsized by selling a McMansion and buying a smaller home. 
About a year after the sale, I asked him what he had done with the 
money and I was flabbergasted when he told me that he had been 
holding it in his checking account. He didn’t know what the interest 
rate was, so I checked. It was 0.01 percent. That’s right, one one-
hundredths of a percent.
I asked why and Blake said he didn’t want to lose any money. True 
enough, his money wasn’t going to go below $1 million, but it wasn’t 
going to go much above $1 million, either. He was losing a lot of 
money compared to how much money he might have if he invested 
in stocks. A return of 0.01 percent on $1 million is $100 in a year’s 
time. A portfolio of blue-chip stocks with 2 percent dividend yields 

Introduction        xvii
﻿      xvii
would generate $20,000 in dividends in a year’s time. There is a 
pretty big difference between $100 and $20,000.
It gets worse. With normal 5 percent dividend growth, the antic-
ipated long-return from the blue-chip stock portfolio is 7 percent. If 
dividends and prices go up by 5 percent the first year, the first-year 
return is $70,000, compared to $100. That’s a heavy price to pay for 
safety.
It is true, as Blake said adamantly, there is no guarantee what 
stock prices will be day to day, week to week, or year to year. Stock 
prices could drop 5, 10, even 20 percent in a single day, even more in 
a year.
I tried to convince Blake of the wisdom of a value-investor per-
spective. Invest in ten, twenty, or thirty great companies with 2 per-
cent dividend yields and then forget about it. Don’t check stock 
prices every day. He could think about something else—his family, 
his job, his hobbies. While he is minding his own business, his stock 
portfolio will pay $20,000 dividends the first year, somewhat more 
the next year, and even more the year after that, with all dividends 
automatically reinvested.
Ten years from now, he can check his portfolio. He will have ac-
cumulated ten years of healthy dividends reinvested to earn even 
more dividends. The market prices of his stocks will almost surely 
be higher ten years from now than they are today, probably much 
higher. The economy will be much larger, corporate earnings will be 
much higher, and dividends will be much higher—so will stock 
prices. If the dividends and earnings on his stocks grow by an aver-
age of 5 percent a year and price-earnings ratios are about the same 
then as they are today, his portfolio will be worth about $2 million, 
as opposed to $1,001,000 if he leaves his money in a checking ac-
count paying 0.01 percent interest for ten years
Blake reluctantly agreed to invest $500,000 in stocks. Wouldn’t 
you know it, he called me the next day to complain that the value of 
his portfolio had dropped by $195. (No, I am not making this up.) 
He wanted to sell his stocks before he lost any more money.

xviii      Introduction
Other people are the exact opposite. I have another friend, 
Emma, who gets the same thrills from buying and selling stocks that 
other people get from winning and losing money in Las Vegas. Every 
weekday morning, Emma bolts out of bed, excited to start a new day 
filled with buying and selling stocks. News tidbits, stock price blips, 
and chat-room rumors provide jolts of excitement as Emma moves 
quickly to buy or sell before others do. By the end of the day, she has 
sold everything she bought during the day because she doesn’t want 
to be blindsided by overnight news. Emma wants to be in control, to 
begin every day with cash that she can deploy during the day as she 
does battle with other investors.
On weekends, Emma is bored and restless. For some people, 
Monday is Blue Monday—the day they have to go back to work. For 
Emma, Monday is Merry Monday—the day she gets to start living 
again.
Emma is a gambling addict. Some people love to watch slot-­
machine wheels spin; Emma loves to watch stock prices dance. Prof-
its are exhilarating. Losses are an incentive to keep betting, hoping 
to recoup those losses and believing that she is due for a win. Day-­
trading stocks is entertainment, but it is not cheap.
I hope this book will convince you that Blake and Emma are bad 
role models. Sensible investors can make a lot more money than 
Blake’s checking account without taking as many risks as Emma’s 
dice rolls. The secret is value investing—buying solid stocks at at-
tractive prices, and leaving them alone.
Value investing is admittedly more adventurous than checking 
accounts and more boring than day-trading, but it is more rewarding 
than both.
Part I of this book will argue that a value-investing strategy can 
help intelligent investors select profitable investments without un-
bearable financial stress. Part II will describe several detailed exam-
ples of value investing.

SEEING THROUGH THE HYPE
If you don’t know who you are, the stock 
market is an expensive place to find out.
—George Goodman
O
n March 11, 2000, I participated in a conference on the 
booming stock market and the widely publicized “36K” pre-
diction that the Dow Jones Industrial Average would soon more 
than triple, from below 12,000 to 36,000. James Glassman and 
Kevin Hassett, two scholars at the American Enterprise Institute, 
had written a cover story for the Atlantic Monthly and a book pub-
lished by Random House arguing that “stock prices could double, 
triple, or even quadruple tomorrow and still not be too high.” Their 
“conservative” estimate of “the right price” was 36,000. It was a pro-
vocative assertion and it was taken seriously by serious people.
The first speaker at the conference talked about Moore’s Law 
(transistor density on integrated circuits doubles every two years). I 
listened intently and agreed that technology is wonderful. But I 
didn’t hear a single word about whether stock prices were too high, 
too low, or just right.
The next speaker talked about how smart dot-com whizzes were. 
When you bought a dot-com stock, you were giving your money to 
clever people who would figure out something profitable to do with 
it. I again listened intently and I agreed that many dot-com compa-
nies were started by smart, likable people. Heck, one of my sons had 

4      MONEY MACHINE
joined with four other recent college graduates to form a dot-com 
company. The five of them rented a house in New Hampshire, slept 
upstairs, and commuted to work by walking downstairs.
What kind of work were they doing downstairs? They didn’t have 
a business plan. The key phrase was “nimble.” They were bright, cre-
ative, and flexible. When a profitable opportunity appeared, these 
five nimble lads would seize it with all ten hands. I knew that these 
were terrific kids and that hundreds of terrific kids were looking for 
ways to profit from the Internet. But I still hadn’t heard a single 
word about whether stock prices were too high, too low, or just 
right.
The next speaker talked about how Alan Greenspan was a won-
derful Fed chair. The Federal Reserve decides when to increase the 
money supply to boost the economy and when to restrain the money 
supply to stifle inflationary pressures. As a cynic (me) once wrote, 
the Fed jacks up interest rates to cause a recession whenever they 
feel it is in our best interests to be unemployed.
It is very important to have the Fed chaired by someone who 
knows what they’re doing. I listened intently and I agreed that Alan 
Greenspan was an impressive Fed chair. But, once again, I didn’t 
hear anything about whether stock prices were too high, too low, or 
just right.
I was the last speaker, and I was the grump at this happy party. I 
looked at stock prices from a variety of perspectives and concluded 
that not only was it far-fetched to think that the Dow would hit 
36,000 anytime soon, but that the current level of stock prices was 
much too high. My final words were, “This is a bubble, and it will 
end badly.”
I was right—eerily so. The conference was on Saturday, March 11, 
2000. The NASDAQ dropped the following Monday and fell by 75 
percent over the next three years from its March 10, 2000, peak. 
AOL fell 85 percent, Yahoo 95 percent. The interesting question is 
not the coincidental timing of my remarks, but why I was convinced 
that this was a bubble.

Seeing Through the Hype      5
During the dot-com bubble, most investors did not try to gauge 
whether stocks were reasonably priced. Instead, they watched stock 
prices go up and they invented explanations to rationalize what was 
happening. They talked about smart kids and Fed chairs. They 
looked at processing speeds and website visitors.
They didn’t talk about whether stock prices were too high, too 
low, or just right. This book will explain how to answer that ques-
tion, which is after all the most fundamental question in investing. 
The answer—no surprise—is value investing.

SPECULATION VERSUS 
INVESTING
Separate and distinct things not to be confused,  
as every thoughtful investor knows, are real worth and market price.
—John Burr Williams
D
ecades ago, investing was haphazard. Investors figured that a 
stock was worth whatever people were willing to pay, and 
the game was to guess what people will pay tomorrow for a stock 
you buy today. Then John Burr Williams unleashed a revolution by 
arguing that investors could use something called present value to 
estimate the intrinsic value of a company’s stock.
Think of a stock as a machine that generates cash every few 
months—cash that happens to be called dividends. The key ques-
tion is how much you would pay to own the machine in order to get 
the cash. This is the stock’s intrinsic value. People who think this way 
are called value investors.
In contrast, speculators buy a stock not for the cash it dispenses, 
but to sell to others for a profit. To a speculator, a stock is worth 
what somebody else will pay for it, and the challenge is to guess what 
others will pay tomorrow for the stock you buy today. This guessing 
game is derisively called the Greater Fool Theory: Buy stocks at in-
flated prices and hope to sell to even bigger fools at still higher 
prices.

Speculation Versus Investing      7
Legendary investor Warren Buffett has this aphorism: “My favor-
ite holding period is forever.” If we think this way, never planning to 
sell, we force ourselves to value stocks based on the cash they gener-
ate, instead of being distracted by guesses about future prices. A 
Buffett variation on this theme is, “I never attempt to make money 
on the stock market. I buy on the assumption that they could close 
the market the next day and not reopen it for five years.” If we think 
this way, we stop speculating about zigs and zags in stock prices and 
focus on the cash generated by the money machine.
The idea is simple and powerful, but often elusive. It is very hard 
to buy a stock without looking at what its price has been in the past 
and thinking about what its price might be in the future. It is very 
hard to think about waiting patiently for cash to accumulate when it 
is so tempting to think about making a quick killing by flipping 
stocks.
People are often lured to the stock market by the ill-conceived 
notion that riches are there for the taking—that they can buy a 
stock right before the price leaves the launchpad. This dream is 
aided and abetted by get-rich-quick gurus peddling fantasies. I once 
received a letter that began “Dear friend.” There’s the first red flag: 
Real friends don’t address you as “Dear friend.” The letter went on, 
“IMAGINE turning $1,000 into $34,500 in less than one year!” The 
letter said that “no special background or education” was needed 
and that “it’s an investment you can make with spare cash that you 
might ordinarily spend on lottery tickets or the racetrack.” Second 
red flag: I don’t buy lottery tickets or bet on horses. Where did they 
get my name? Why did they think I was a sucker? This was getting 
embarrassing.
The “secret” was low-priced stocks. To demonstrate the “explo-
sive profit potential,” the letter listed twenty low-priced stocks and 
said that $100 invested in each ($2,000 in all) would have grown in 
the blink of an eye to $26,611. Not only that, but another stock, 
LKA International, had gone from 2 cents to 69 cents a share in a 
few months, which would have turned $1,000 into $34,500. The let-

8      MONEY MACHINE
ter concluded by offering a special $39 report that would give me ac-
cess to “the carefully guarded territory of a few shrewd ‘inner circle’ 
investors.”
That was the third red flag. Why would anyone who had a real 
get-rich-quick system peddle it instead of using it? Why waste pre-
cious time selling newsletters for $39? Some self-proclaimed gurus 
assert that they have made more than enough money and want to 
share their secrets with others who are as poor as they once were: “If 
a loser like me can make money, so can a loser like you!” If they are 
truly rich, why don’t they send us money instead of asking for more?
It is preposterous to think that the stock market gives away 
money. There is a story about two finance professors who see a 
$100 bill on the sidewalk. As one professor reaches for it, the other 
says, “Don’t bother; if it were real, someone would have picked it 
up by now.” Finance professors are fond of saying that the stock 
market doesn’t leave $100 bills on the sidewalk, meaning that if 
there were an easy way to make money, someone would have fig-
ured it out by now.
There is truth in that, but it is not completely true. Stock prices 
are sometimes wacky. During speculative booms and financial crises, 
the stock market leaves suitcases full of $100 bills on the sidewalk. 
Still, when you think you have found an easy way to make money, 
you should ask yourself if other investors have overlooked a $100 
bill on the sidewalk or if you have overlooked a logical explanation.
Investors make voluntary transactions—some buying and others 
selling—and a stock won’t trade at 2 cents if it is clear that the price 
will soon be 69 cents. Even if only a shrewd inner circle know that 
the price will soon be 69 cents, they will buy millions of shares, driv-
ing the price today up to 69 cents.
When LKA traded at 2 cents a share, there were an equal number 
of buyers and sellers, neither side knowing for sure whether the 
price would be higher or lower the next day or the day after that. 
The optimists bought and the pessimists sold. The optimists hap-

buying stocks at their lowest prices and selling at their highest, is 
foolish.
Probably the most successful stock market investor of all time is 
Warren Buffett, who made about 20 percent a year over some fifty 
years. This isn’t close to the fantasies concocted by dream peddlers, 
but it is absolutely spectacular compared to the performance of the 
average investor, who has made about 10 percent a year.
Some stocks do spectacularly well, just as some lottery tickets 
turn out to be winners. But it is a delusion to think that you will be-
come an instant millionaire by buying stocks or lottery tickets. A 
more realistic goal is to make intelligent investments and avoid fi-
nancial potholes.
The key is to resist the temptation to buy and sell stocks based 
on wishful thinking about prices. Instead, think of stocks as money 
machines and think about what you would be willing to pay for the 
cash they generate over an indefinite horizon. If you do, you will be 
a value investor—and glad of it.

SEMI-EFFICIENT MARKETS
The real trouble with this world of ours is not that it is an unreason-
able world, nor even that it is a reasonable one. The commonest  
kind of trouble is that it is nearly reasonable, but not quite.  
Life . . . looks just a little more mathematical and regular than it is;  
its exactitude is obvious, but its inexactitude is hidden; 
 its wildness lies in wait.
—G. K. Chesterton
I 
have a small army of former students who alert me to interest-
ing stories I may have missed. One sent me a Wall Street Journal 
article titled “Clues Abound for the Small Investor to Divine Market 
Direction.” According to the article:
The long-term investor can make his decisions based on in-
formation easily available in his morning newspaper. In-
deed, Thom Brown, managing director of the Philadelphia 
investment firm of Rutherford, Brown & Catherwood, ad-
vises investors to simply read a daily newspaper.
“Look for anything that suggests the direction of the 
economy,” he says. “Auto sales, for example, give you an idea 
about how willing consumers are to part with their money.” 
An expanding economy usually means rising stock prices.
Was this former student passing along a useful tip? Nope. She was 
contributing to my extensive collection of silly things said by sensi-

Semi-Efficient Markets      11
ble people. She added this note, “What everyone knows isn’t worth 
knowing.”
THE IDEA OF AN EFFICIENT MARKET
The efficient market hypothesis is that stock prices take into ac-
count all relevant information so that no investor can take advan-
tage of other people’s ignorance. An efficient market does not 
require zero profits. After all, even boring bank accounts pay inter-
est. Investors won’t buy stocks unless they expect to make some 
money. Stocks do pay dividends and the average stock investor does 
make money—about 10 percent a year over the past 100 years. The 
efficient market hypothesis is that no one can make excessive prof-
its except by being lucky.
The stock market would not be efficient if sales of Ford F-150 
pickup trucks jumped dramatically and investors who read about 
the sales increase in the morning newspaper could buy Ford stock at 
low prices from investors who didn’t know about the sales bump. 
Market efficiency does not assume that every investor knows about 
the sales increase—just that enough well-informed and well-­financed 
investors are ready to jump-start Ford’s stock price to where it 
would be if everyone did know the news. Ford’s stock price should 
jump as soon as some investors know of the F-150 surge, and this 
immediate price bump protects amateurs from selling at outdated 
prices. An efficient market is a fair game in the sense that no inves-
tor can beat the market by knowing something other investors don’t 
know.
ANTICIPATED EVENTS AND SURPRISES
If a toy store’s sales increase before Christmas, will its stock price 
increase too? It depends. When the stock traded in the summer, 

12      MONEY MACHINE
­investors tried to predict holiday sales and they valued the stock 
based on these predictions. If the forecasts turn out to be correct, 
there is no reason for the stock price to change on the day that the 
sales numbers are announced. The price will change, however, if 
sales turn out to be unexpectedly strong or disappointing.
Stock prices do not rise or fall when events that are expected to 
happen do happen. Stock prices do change if the unexpected hap-
pens. However, by definition, it is impossible to predict the unex-
pected. Therefore, it is impossible to predict changes in stock prices. 
That is a pretty good argument. So is its implication.
It is not enough to know that Ford F-150 sales increased last 
quarter or that auto sales increase when the economy gets stronger. 
The benchmark to gauge your investment ideas is not,
How is today different from yesterday?
or
How will tomorrow differ from today?
but
How does my prediction of tomorrow differ from what others expect?
When you think you have a good reason for buying a stock, ask 
yourself if you know something that other investors don’t know. If 
you do, it may be inside information that is illegal to use (for reasons 
discussed later in this chapter). If you don’t, your information is 
probably already reflected in market prices.
It seems obvious, but sometimes the obvious is overlooked. A 
longtime financial columnist for the New York Times offered this log-
ical, but not very helpful, advice for buying bonds:
It is obviously good sense to buy bonds when the Federal 
Reserve Banks start lowering interest rates. It is just as obvi-
ously bad sense to buy them at any time when, two or three 

Semi-Efficient Markets      13
or four months hence, the Fed is certain to start raising 
money rates and lowering the prices of outstanding bonds.
Anything that has already happened or is certain to happen is surely 
already embedded in bond prices.
Similarly, you won’t get rich following this advice in the ­Consumers 
Digest Get Rich Investment Guide:
The ability to track interest rates as they pertain to bonds is 
made easier by following the path of the Prime Rate (the rate 
of interest charged by banks to their top clients). If the con-
sensus shown in top business journals indicates that rates are 
going up, this means that bonds will go down in price. There-
fore, when it seems that rates are moving up, an investor 
should wait until some “peaking” of rates is foreseen.
Seriously, isn’t it obvious that easily available information doesn’t 
give you an edge over other investors? What everybody knows isn’t 
worth knowing.
UNCERTAINTY AND DISAGREEMENT
The efficient market hypothesis does not assume that everyone 
agrees on what a security is worth. Market opinion of IBM in the 
spring of 1987 provides a particularly dramatic example. At that 
time, IBM was probably the most widely scrutinized company. Value 
Line’s highly regarded analysts gave IBM stock its lowest rating, 
placing it among the bottom 10 percent in predicted performance 
over the next twelve months. At the very same time, Kidder Pea-
body’s widely respected research department gave IBM its highest 
rating and included IBM in its recommended model portfolio of 
twenty stocks. This was not an isolated fluke.
On Thursday, November 11, 2010, TheStreet.com posted an arti-
cle titled “How Nokia’s Stock Price Could Double.” Three days 

14      MONEY MACHINE
later, on Sunday, November 14, Seeking Alpha posted an article ti-
tled “Nokia Is Still Overvalued,” arguing that a “more realistic” value 
would be half of its current price. Nothing substantive happened be-
tween November 11 and November 14, yet these two influential 
websites had dramatically different views of Nokia stock. That’s why 
there are buyers and sellers.
For any stock, at the current market price, there are as many buy-
ers as sellers—as many people who think that the stock is over-
priced as think it is a bargain. The efficient market hypothesis says 
that it is never evident that a stock’s price is about to surge or col-
lapse—for if it were, there wouldn’t be a balance between buyers and 
sellers.
The fact that changes in stock prices are hard to predict does not 
imply that stock prices are correct according to some external, ob-
jective criterion. Market prices reflect what buyers are willing to pay 
and sellers to accept, and both may be led astray by human emotions 
and misperceptions. This distinction is crucial for understanding 
what the efficient market hypothesis does and does not say.
MARKET TIMING
Most investors try to time their purchases and sales—to buy before 
prices go up and sell before they go down. A longtime financial 
writer for the New York Times offered this attractive goal:
Since we know stocks are going to fall as well as rise, we 
might as well get a little traffic out of them. A man who buys 
a stock at 10 and sells it at 20 makes 100 percent. But a man 
who buys it at 10, sells it at 14 1/2, buys it back at 12 and sells 
it at 18, buys it back at 15 and sells it at 20, makes 188 percent.
If only it were this easy!
It would be great to jump nimbly in and out of stocks, catching 
every rise and missing every drop, but how do we know in advance 

Semi-Efficient Markets      15
whether prices are headed up or down? J. P. Morgan was exactly 
right when he said that “the market will go up and it will go down, 
but not necessarily in that order.”
I am no fan of frenetic trading; still, there are times when stock 
prices are seriously out of whack because investors are far too pessi-
mistic or optimistic. Our goal is to recognize compelling times to 
buy and times to sell. Ironically, the key is not to attempt to buy be-
fore prices go up and sell before they go down, but to think about 
whether the money machine is cheap or expensive—to be a value in-
vestor. I will explain this paradox in later chapters.
STOCK SELECTION
In contrast to market timing, stock selection is picking stocks that 
will beat other stocks, a task the efficient market hypothesis says is 
futile. For example, you might buy stock in a company that an-
nounces a large earnings increase and avoid firms that report flat or 
declining earnings. However, analysts predict earnings long before 
they are announced and stock prices reflect these predictions. An-
nouncements that are in line with predictions—regardless of 
whether earnings are predicted to go up or down—have little effect 
on prices. To pick stocks that will do better than other stocks, based 
on their earnings, you need to predict which companies’ earnings 
surprises will be good news and which will be bad news. How does 
one predict surprises?
A former student told me about an interesting project he had 
worked on. His consulting firm had been hired by the directors of a 
major consumer-products company to recommend an executive 
compensation plan. The board wanted the firm, year after year, to be 
one of the highest-ranked consumer-products companies based on 
total shareholder return, dividends plus capital gains.
The consulting company immediately recognized the problem 
with this goal. Do you see it, too?

16      MONEY MACHINE
The consulting company calculated shareholder returns for 160 
consumer-products companies over three-year intervals: 1980–1982, 
1983–1985, and so on. For each three-year period, they ranked the 
companies from 1 to 160 based on total shareholder return. They 
then made a scatter plot with each firm’s ranking during one of those 
three-year periods on the horizontal axis and the ranking during the 
next three-year period on the vertical axis. The scatter plot in Figure 
3-1 is striking, but not for the usual reason. Instead of showing a 
strong positive or negative correlation, it appears that a blindfolded 
person threw ink at paper.
That was exactly the point the consulting firm wanted to make. 
A company’s executives may be able to increase a firm’s profits, but 
trying to outperform the stock market year after year is an elusive 
goal. For a company’s stock price to go up more than investors ex-
pect, the firm must do better than investors expect. For the stock 
price to soar every year, the firm must do better than investors ex-
pect every year. Good luck with that!

THE PERFORMANCE OF PROFESSIONALS
Another way of testing the efficient market hypothesis is to look at 
the records of professional investors, who presumably base their de-
cisions on publicly available information. If they consistently beat 
the market, they apparently have an advantage over amateur 
­investors.
The record of professional investors as a group has been medio-
cre, at best. In his persuasive book The New Contrarian Investment 
Strategy, David Dreman looked at fifty-two surveys of stocks or 
stock portfolios recommended by professional investors. Forty of 
them underperformed the market. Perhaps some professionals are 
pros and the rest are amateurs pretending to be pros. Nope. There 
is no consistency in which professional investors do well and which 
do poorly. A study of 200 institutional stock portfolios found that of 
those who ranked in the top 25 percent in one five-year period, 26 
percent ranked in the top 25 percent during the next five years, 48 
percent ranked in the middle 50 percent, and 26 percent were in the 
bottom 25 percent.
CAN WE DISTINGUISH SKILL FROM LUCK?
Some investors do compile outstanding records. However, consider 
the coin-calling experiment that I sometimes do in my investment 
classes. Suppose that there are thirty-two students and that half of 
them predict heads for the first flip while half of them predict tails. 
The coin is flipped and lands heads, making the first half right. The 
sixteen students who were right then predict a second flip, with half 
saying heads and the other half tails. It comes up tails and the eight 
students who have been right twice in a row now try for a third time. 
Half predict heads and half tails, and the coin lands tails again. The 
four students who were right divide again on whether the next flip 
will be heads or tails. The result is tails and now we’re down to two 

18      MONEY MACHINE
students. One calls heads and the other tails. It is a heads and we 
have our winner—the student who correctly predicted five in a row. 
Are you confident that this student will call the next five flips 
­correctly?
Even monkeys throwing darts and analysts flipping coins some-
times get lucky—an observation that cautions us that past successes 
are no guarantee of future success. Not only that, even if some ana-
lysts are somewhat better than average, stock market volatility 
makes it very difficult to separate the skilled from the lucky.
Imagine there are 10,000 analysts and 10 percent of them have a 
0.60 probability of predicting correctly whether the stock market 
will go up or down in the coming year. The remaining 90 percent, 
like monkeys throwing darts, have only a 0.50 probability of making 
a correct prediction. Call the analysts in the first group skilled and 
those in the second group lucky.
If we look at their records over a ten-year period, we can expect 
six of the 1,000 skilled analysts to make correct predictions in all 
ten years. Among the 9,000 analysts who are merely lucky, nine can 
be expected to make ten correct predictions. This means that if we 
choose one of the fifteen analysts who have been right for ten years 
in a row, there is only a 40 percent chance that we will choose a 
skilled analyst. This is considerably better than the 10 percent 
chance of picking a skilled analyst if we ignore their records; but 
still—and this is the point—past performance is far from a guaran-
tee of future success.
In practice, there is even more uncertainty because we often do 
not have a complete and accurate record over many years. Some an-
alysts are too young. Others distort their records, perhaps by selec-
tively reporting their successes and omitting their failures. Also, 
alas, skills are not constant. By the time someone has compiled an 
impressive track record, energy and insight may be fading.
Some investors surely are more skilled than lucky. However, the 
records of most are brief, mixed, or exaggerated, and there is no sure 
way to separate the talented from the lucky and the liars. The stock 

Semi-Efficient Markets      19
market is not all luck, but it is more luck than nervous investors 
want to hear or successful investors want to admit.
INSIDER TRADING
Section 10(b)5 of the 1934 Securities and Exchange Act makes it “un-
lawful for any person to employ any device, scheme or artifice to de-
fraud or to engage in any act, practice or course of business which 
operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person.”
This law was enacted in response to a variety of fraudulent activ-
ities in the 1920s that manipulated stock prices and misled naive in-
vestors. For instance, an investment pool could push a stock’s price 
up, up, and up by trading the stock back and forth among members 
of the pool, and then sell to investors lured by the stock’s upward 
momentum.
Such activities have not disappeared completely. In 1987 a con 
man was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison after he pleaded 
guilty to conspiracy and fraud in manipulating the prices of two 
small stocks by buying and selling shares through fifty-three ac-
counts at eighteen brokerage firms.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also uses 
Section 10(b)5 for a very different purpose—to prosecute perceived 
insider-trading abuses. Insider information is not even mentioned, 
let alone defined in the law, but over the years, through a series of 
court cases, the SEC has created a set of legal precedents. The SEC 
has also gone after insider traders for related crimes, such as mail or 
wire fraud, obstruction of justice, and income tax evasion.
The SEC interprets illegal insider trading as that based on im-
portant information that has not yet been made public if the infor-
mation was obtained wrongfully (such as by theft or bribery) or if 
the person has a fiduciary responsibility to keep the information 
confidential. Nor can investors trade on the basis of information 
that they know or have reason to know was obtained wrongfully.

20      MONEY MACHINE
The SEC is unlikely to press charges if it is convinced that a leak 
of confidential information was inadvertent; for example, a conver-
sation overheard on an airplane. However, courts have consistently 
ruled that a company’s officers and directors should not profit from 
buying or selling stock before the public announcement of impor-
tant corporate news. The SEC has also won cases against relatives 
and friends of corporate insiders, establishing the principle that 
someone tipped by an insider is an insider, too. In the 1968 Texas 
Gulf Sulphur case, involving the purchase of stock by company ex-
ecutives and outsiders who had been tipped before the public an-
nouncement of an enormous ore discovery, a federal appeals court 
ruled that “anyone—corporate insider or not—who regularly re-
ceives material non-public information may not use that informa-
tion to trade in securities without incurring an affirmative duty to 
disclose.”
The SEC has frequently won cases based on a different 
­principle—that insider trading is robbery, the theft of information. 
In 1984, a federal court of appeals upheld the conviction of Anthony 
Materia, a printing house employee, who had decoded documents 
(with missing company names) that he was printing relating to merg-
ers and takeovers and then bought shares in the target companies. 
The court ruled that he violated a duty to his employer and its clients 
when he “stole information to which he was privy in his work. . . . 
Materia’s theft of information was indeed as fraudulent as if he had 
converted corporate funds for his personal benefit.”
Please don’t take chances cheating and hoping to outwit the 
SEC. It isn’t worth it and you don’t need to break any laws. You can 
make more than enough money by being an honest value investor.
HUMAN EMOTIONS
Investment decisions depend not only on known facts, but also 
human emotions like greed and overconfidence, which lead some 

Semi-Efficient Markets      21
­investors astray and leave opportunities for others. This is why the 
stock market is only semi-efficient. Here are three examples.
Confusing a great company with a great stock. We eat in a good 
restaurant, buy a fun toy, admire attractive clothing, see a wonderful 
movie, ride in a nice car, and think, “I should buy stock in that com-
pany.” Before rushing to buy, ask yourself whether you are the only 
one who knows how wonderful these things are. If not, the stock 
price probably already reflects the fact that it is a good company. 
The question is not whether the products are worth buying, but 
whether the stock is worth buying. If the stock’s price is too high, 
the answer is no.
Later, you will see that the glamour stocks of companies that 
make great products and generate strong profits are more likely to 
be overpriced than are the stocks of struggling companies. Who has 
the courage to buy stock in bad companies? Not many, which is why 
struggling companies’ stocks are often cheap.
Buying hot tips. My family went on a vacation to Costa Rica in 
2010 and we met a man named David who bragged that he was pay-
ing for his vacation with the profits he was going to make on a stock 
investment. I asked him about the stock and was not surprised when 
he said that he had been given a hot tip by his auto mechanic on a 
stock that had nothing whatsoever to do with cars.
The hot tip was Ecosphere Technologies (ESPH), a small com-
pany that owns several environmental technologies, including the 
Ecos PowerCube, a solar-power generator that can be used in re-
mote locations. David bought 10,000 shares at $1 per share in early 
March. The price had jumped to $1.65 in late March and his $6,500 
profit was enough to pay for his Costa Rica vacation.
The problem was that, year after year, Ecosphere Technologies 
either lost money or made a small profit. There was nothing to prop 
up the price except people like David, who were buying the stock 
based on a hot tip. Figures 3-2 and 3-3 show that there was a huge 

22      MONEY MACHINE
surge in the stock’s price and the volume of trading during the first 
three months of 2010 (when David bought). Then the price col-
lapsed. Six years later, the price was 3 cents a share.

ESPH’s stock price had gone up, no doubt fueled by people who 
heard the hot tips and rushed to buy the stock. There are two prob-
lems with hot tips. One is that they may be unfounded rumors, per-
haps spread by people who own the stock already and want to sell at 
a higher price. Second, if there is any truth to the rumors, it may al-
ready be embedded in the price.
Chasing trends. I was talking to a friendly guy named Lou at a party 
and he told me that, because he lives in California, he gets up at five 
thirty every morning so that he can be at his computer, ready to 
trade, when the stock market opens at six thirty Pacific Time. He 
has a software program that alerts him when it notices a stock price 
going up by some preset amount; for example, one percent since the 
market opened or one percent in the past hour. Lou watches the 
price for a few moments and, if he likes what he sees, he buys the 
stock and holds it until the price goes down enough to persuade him 
that the run-up is over.
I asked Lou how he was doing and was surprised by his candor: “I 
lower my tax bill every April.” He explained that, on balance, he al-
ways seems to have more capital losses than gains and he can use his 
net capital losses to reduce his taxable income. He said that he is 
still trying to perfect his timing but, more often than not, he either 
buys the stock too late (after the run-up is over) or sells too late 
(after he has lost money).
Lou’s explanation is just a roundabout way of saying that chasing 
trends doesn’t work because what a stock price has done in the past 
is an unreliable predictor of what the price will do in the future.
Sometimes, there are a lot of folks like Lou out there, chasing the 
same trends. They notice stock prices going up (perhaps because 
their friends are bragging about how much money they are making) 
and rush to buy so that they can make money, too. When lots of 
trend chasers are buying, their lust can push prices higher still, lur-
ing more trend chasers. This imitative behavior fuels speculative 

24      MONEY MACHINE
bubbles—stock prices going up for no reason other than people are 
buying stock because prices have been going up.
When stock prices stop going up, they go down very fast because 
there is no reason to buy other than a belief that prices will go up. 
THE DELUSION OF CROWDS
Michael C. Jensen, a Harvard Business School professor, wrote, 
“The vast scientific evidence on the theory of efficient markets indi-
cates that, in the absence of inside information, a security’s market 
price represents the best available estimate of its true value.” The 
idea is that while some investors may substantially overestimate the 
value of a stock, other investors will err in the other direction, and 
these errors will balance out so that the collective judgment of the 
crowd is close to the correct value.
The wisdom of crowds has a lot of appeal. The classic example is 
a jelly bean experiment conducted by finance professor Jack Treynor. 
He showed fifty-six students a jar containing 850 jelly beans and 
asked them to write down how many beans they thought were in the 
jar. The average guess was 871, an error of only 2 percent. Only one 
student did better. This experiment has been cited over and over as 
evidence that the average opinion of the value of a stock is likely to 
be close to the “correct” value.
The analogy is not apt. As Treynor noted, the student guesses 
were made independently and had no systematic bias. When these 
assumptions are true, the average guess will, on average, be closer 
to the true value than the majority of the individual guesses. That 
is a mathematical fact. But it is not a fact if those assumptions are 
wrong. After the initial student guesses were recorded, Treynor 
­advised the students that they should allow for air space at the top 
of the bean jar and that the plastic jar’s exterior was thinner than a 
glass jar. The average estimate increased to 979.2, an error of 15 
percent. The many were no longer smarter than the few. “Although 

Semi-Efficient Markets      25
the cautions weren’t intended to be misleading,” Treynor wrote, 
“they seem to have caused some shared error to creep into the 
­estimates.”
There is a lot of shared error in the stock market. Investor opin-
ions are not formed independently and are not free of systematic bi-
ases. Stock prices are buffeted by fads, fancies, greed, and 
gloom—what Keynes called “animal spirits.” Contagious mass psy-
chology causes not only pricing errors, but speculative bubbles and 
unwarranted panics.
In an investor survey near the peak of the dot-com bubble in 
2000, the median prediction of the annual return on stocks over the 
next ten years was 15 percent. It wasn’t just naive amateurs. Suppos-
edly sophisticated hedge funds were buying dot-com stocks just as 
feverishly as small investors. This was not collective wisdom; this 
was collective delusion. They didn’t see the bubble because they did 
not want to see it. The actual annual return over the next ten years 
turned out to be -0.5 percent.
The 2013 Nobel Prize in Economics was given to two economists 
with very different views of the efficient market hypothesis. As de-
scribed by Chicago professor Eugene Fama:
An “efficient” market for securities . . . [is] a market where, 
given the available information, actual prices at every point 
in time represent very good estimates of intrinsic values.
Yale professor Robert Shiller has a very different view:
One form of this argument claims that . . . the real price of 
stocks is close to the intrinsic value. . . . This argument for 
the efficient markets hypothesis represents one of the most 
remarkable errors in the history of economic thought.
Fama believes that markets set the correct price, the price that God 
herself would set, and that changes in stock prices are hard to pre-
dict because they are caused by new information, which, by defini-
tion, cannot be predicted. 

26      MONEY MACHINE
Shiller’s view is that changes in stock prices may be hard to 
­predict because of unpredictable, sometimes irrational, revisions in 
investor expectations—as if God determined stock prices by flip-
ping a coin. If so, changes in market prices are impossible to predict, 
but market prices are not good estimates of intrinsic value.
What they both agree on is that it is hard to predict changes in 
stock prices. It is tempting to think that, as in any profession, good 
training, hard work, and a skilled mind will yield superior results. 
And it is especially tempting to think that you possess these very 
characteristics.
A student did a term paper in my statistics class at Pomona Col-
lege where 200 randomly selected students were asked if their 
height, intelligence, and attractiveness were above average or below 
average compared to other Pomona students of the same gender. 
The reality is that an equal number are above average and below av-
erage. Individual perceptions were quite different. Fifty-six percent 
of the female students and 49 percent of the males believed their 
height was above average, well within the range of sampling error. 
However, 84 percent of the females and 79 percent of the males be-
lieved their intelligence was above average; and 74 percent of the fe-
males and 68 percent of the males believed their attractiveness was 
above average.
It is a common human trait, probably inherited from our distant 
ancestors, to overestimate ourselves. Back then, it was hard to sur-
vive in a challenging, often unforgiving world without confidence. 
Self-confidence had survival and reproductive value and came to 
dominate the gene pool. These days, we still latch on to evidence of 
our strengths and discount evidence to the contrary. This is so com-
mon that it even has a name: confirmation bias.
We think we can predict the result of a football game, an elec-
tion, or a stock pick. If our prediction turns out to be correct, this 
confirms how smart we are. If our prediction does not come true, it 
was just bad luck—poor officiating, low voter turnout, the irrational-
ity of other investors.

Semi-Efficient Markets      27
Very few investors think they are below average, even though 
half are. After all, would people sell one stock and buy another if 
they thought they would be wrong more often than right? Every de-
cision that works out confirms our wisdom. Every mistake is attrib-
uted to bad luck beyond our control.
This overconfidence is why people trade so much, thinking they 
know more than the investors on the other side of their trades. It 
is why investors don’t hold sufficiently diversified portfolios, be-
lieving that there is little chance that the stocks they pick will do 
poorly. It is why investors hold on to their losers, believing that it 
is only a matter of time until other investors realize how great 
these stocks are.
WARREN BUFFETT AND SOME CONTRARIANS
Human sentiments like greed and overconfidence illustrate the cru-
cial difference between possessing information and processing informa-
tion. Possessing information is knowing something about a company 
that others do not know. Processing information is thinking more 
clearly about things we all know.
Warren Buffett did not beat the market for decades by having ac-
cess to information that was not available to others, but by thinking 
more clearly about information available to everyone. Beginning in 
1956 with a $100,000 partnership, he earned a 31 percent compound 
annual rate of return over the next fourteen years, with never a los-
ing year. In 1969, feeling stocks to be overpriced, Buffett left the 
stock market and dissolved the partnership. The “wizard of Omaha” 
returned to the stock market in the 1970s, making investments 
through Berkshire Hathaway, formerly a cloth-milling company. 
Continuing to earn nearly 20 percent a year, his net worth was $65 
billion in 2016.
In the 1980s I debated the efficient market hypothesis with a 
prominent Stanford professor. I said that Buffett was evidence that 

28      MONEY MACHINE
the market could be beaten by processing information better than 
other investors. His response was immediate and dismissive: 
“Enough monkeys hitting enough keys . . .” He was referring to the 
classic infinite monkey theorem, one version of which states that a 
handful of monkeys pounding away at typewriters will eventually 
write every book that humans have ever written. One eternal mon-
key could do the same; but a very large number of monkeys could be 
expected to do it sooner. The Stanford professor’s argument was 
that with so many people buying and selling stocks over so many de-
cades, one person is bound to be so much luckier than the rest as to 
appear to be a genius—when he is really just a lucky monkey.
In a 1984 speech at Columbia University celebrating the fiftieth 
anniversary of Benjamin Graham and David Dodd’s value-investing 
treatise, Security Analysis, Buffett rebutted the lucky-monkey argu-
ment by noting that he personally knows eight other portfolio man-
agers who, like Buffett, adhere to the value-investing principles 
taught by Graham and Dodd. All nine have outperformed the mar-
ket dramatically for many years. How many monkeys would it take 
to generate that performance?
Yet many academics are skeptical (or perhaps jealous?). In 2006, 
Austan Goolsbee, a Chicago Booth School of Business professor 
who served as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers for Presi-
dent Obama, was interviewed on American Public Media and said:
I’d tell [Berkshire Hathaway] shareholders to watch their 
wallets. See, I’m an economist, and it always sticks in my 
craw when people say Warren has the Midas touch. That’s 
because the one thing that professors pound into young 
economists is that the only investors who beat the market 
are ones who get lucky or else take risk.
I am unpersuaded. I have a personal interest in believing that some 
investors process information better than others, just as some doc-
tors and lawyers do. My belief in Buffett is fortified by the fact that, 
unlike monkeys, Buffett makes sense. His annual reports are excep-

Semi-Efficient Markets      29
tionally wise and well written. They are also his own opinions, not a 
repackaging of what others are saying.
Too many investors are hostage to a groupthink mentality that 
values conformity above independent thought. Ironically, institu-
tional groupthink is encouraged by a legal need to be “prudent.” Just 
as no purchasing agent ever got fired for buying IBM equipment, so 
no money manager has ever been thought imprudent for buying 
IBM stock. As Keynes observed, “Worldly wisdom teaches that it is 
better for reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed uncon-
ventionally.” Who can fault someone who fails when everyone else is 
failing?
Buffett generally ignores the crowd and makes up his own mind. 
Other investors have prospered by watching the crowd and doing 
the opposite. In May 1932, with stock prices at their lowest level in 
this century, Dean Witter sent a memo to his company’s brokers and 
management saying:
All of our customers with money must someday put it to 
work—into some revenue-producing investment. Why not 
invest it now, when securities are cheap?
Some people say they want to wait for a clearer view of 
the future. But when the future is again clear, the present 
bargains will have vanished. In fact, does anyone think that 
today’s prices will prevail once full confidence has been 
­restored?
That’s exactly right. Bargains are not going to be found when inves-
tors are optimistic, but when they are pessimistic. In Warren Buf-
fett’s memorable words, “Be fearful when others are greedy and 
greedy when others are fearful.”
If the herdlike instincts of institutional investors push the prices 
of glamour stocks to unjustifiable levels, then perhaps the road to 
investment success is to do the opposite—as J. Paul Getty advised in 
his autobiography, “Buy when everyone else is selling and hold until 
everyone else is buying.” A deliberate attempt to do the opposite of 

30      MONEY MACHINE
what others are doing is called a contrarian strategy, and it can be ap-
plied to individual stocks (buying the least popular stocks) and to 
the market as a whole (buying when other investors are bearish).
The experts have been notoriously wrong at dramatic market 
turning points: In recent years, they were optimistic before the dot-
com bubble popped in the spring of 2000 and pessimistic before the 
market bottomed in the summer of 2002. The optimism returned as 
the market peaked in the summer of 2007, followed by pessimism as 
the market bottomed in the winter of 2009.
With individual stocks, the favorites often do poorly. A represen-
tative example is a study of the recommendations of the twenty “su-
perstar” analysts selected in a poll of institutional investors. Of the 
132 stocks they recommended, two-thirds did worse than the S&P 
500. The average gain for the 132 stocks picked by the most re-
spected and highly paid security analysts was 9 percent, as compared 
to 14 percent for the S&P 500. A large institutional buyer of re-
search concluded glumly, “It’s uncanny—when they say one thing, 
start doing the opposite. Usually you are right.”
These superstar pros were not throwing darts. They were infatu-
ated with fads, overconfident of their abilities, chasing trends, or se-
duced by other human misperceptions.
Because of these human emotions, the stock market is only semi-
efficient, which is good news for value investors—who don’t throw 
darts, either.

TORTURING DATA
If you torture the data long enough, it will confess.
—Ronald Coase
W
hat’s so hard about predicting stock prices? Anyone with 
open eyes can see patterns in stock prices—patterns that 
are a self-evident foretelling of whether prices are headed up or down.
Thirty years ago, a former student named Jeff called me with ex-
citing news—my lectures on the futility of trying to discern profit-
able patterns in stock prices were hogwash. Jeff had taken a job with 
IBM and, in his spare time (ha, ha!), was studying stock prices and 
had found some clear patterns. He was fine-tuning his system and 
would soon be rich. He told me that he was going to rent a helicopter 
and land it on the lawn outside my classroom so that he could march 
into my investments class triumphantly and tell students the truth.
Every year, I tell the students this story. Then I walk over to a 
classroom window and look outside to see if Jeff’s helicopter is 
parked outside. I’m still waiting.
THE NATURE OF TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
Technical analysts try to gauge investor sentiment by studying stock 
prices, trading volume, and various measures of investor sentiment. 
Technicians do not look at dividends or profits, either for individual 

32      MONEY MACHINE
companies or for the market as a whole. If they are studying an in-
dividual company, they don’t even need to know the company’s 
name. It might bias their reading of the charts.
A technical analyst can be compared to a person who watches a 
computer program draw lines on a monitor and tries to discover a 
pattern that will predict the next line to be drawn. The lines them-
selves are all that matters and it would be distracting to think about 
whether the computer program was written in Java or C++. In the 
same way, the mood of the stock market can be gauged by watching 
stock prices; additional news about the economy or specific compa-
nies would be distracting. John Magee, who coauthored the so-
called bible of technical analysis, boarded up the windows of his 
office so that his readings of the hopes and fears of the market would 
not be influenced by the sight of birds singing or snow falling.
A technician’s most important tool is a chart of stock prices. The 
most popular are vertical-line charts, traditionally using daily price 
data. Each vertical line spans the high and low prices, with horizon-
tal slashes showing the opening and closing prices. A technician 
adds lines, like the channel in Figure 4-1, to show a trend or other 
exploitable pattern (to reduce the clutter, I omitted the vertical 
lines and just show the closing prices).

TECHNICAL GURUS
Humans have a natural affinity for professed experts who replace 
confusion and ambiguity with clarity and decisiveness. Periodically, 
a technical analyst is elevated to the status of financial guru when as-
toundingly accurate predictions are reported in the media and de-
voted followers seek the advice of these celebrities.
For example, Joseph Granville was a flamboyant guru, sometimes 
enlivening his public speeches with vaudeville skits using a chim-
panzee or ventriloquist’s dummy and at other times preaching in a 
prophet’s robes:
The market is a jealous God. It rewards winners and chastises 
losers. The Holy Bible is a record of winners and losers. The 
market follows every precept in that Book—if the market 
does not follow man’s ways, what does it follow? God’s ways.
His forecasts were so inaccurate in the early 1970s (due, he says, to 
an addiction to golf) that he abandoned the stock market com-
pletely. But then “golfers anonymous” turned his life around and he 
wrote a book, How to Win at Bingo, that sold 500,000 copies. Buoyed 
by this success and four years of good stock market predictions in 
the late 1970s, he boasted of having “cracked the secret of markets,” 
promised that he would never make a serious mistake again, and 
nominated himself for the Nobel Prize in Economics. In his spare 
time, he predicted that Los Angeles would be destroyed by an 8.3 
earthquake in May 1981.
Granville issued a buy recommendation in April 1980 and the 
Dow jumped 30 points the next day, perhaps propelled by avid sub-
scribers following his advice. In September, he continued to predict a 
runaway stock market. “Short sellers are about to get the heat, and if 
you think hell is hot, watch.” On January 6, 1981, he abruptly turned 
bearish; his post-midnight calls to his biggest subscribers telling 
them to sell all of their stocks (even while his normal market letter 
advised smaller subscribers to buy) provoked the “Granville crash,” a 

34      MONEY MACHINE
24-point drop in the Dow on January 7. In his March 7, 1981, news­
letter, he declared that the “March Massacre” had begun and that he 
couldn’t possibly be wrong in his prediction that the Dow would fall 
at least 100 points and possibly 200 points by May 1. In fact, the 
Dow rose from 965 to 996. His recycled sell recommendation in Sep-
tember 1981 sent tremors through financial markets.
In late September 1981, he appeared on British television, advis-
ing investors to sell everything. He predicted that British interest 
rates would jump from 14 percent to above 17 percent and that the 
British industrial stock index would sink like a stone, from 480 to 
150. British interest rates peaked the next month and headed down-
ward to 12 percent in 1982 and 10 percent in 1983. The stock index 
bottomed at 474 in October 1981, too, and headed upward, to 580, a 
year later, then 700 the year after, and then to 900 in 1984. It reached 
1000 in 1985 and 1300 in 1986.
Meanwhile, back in the United States, Granville remained bear-
ish throughout 1982–1985, missing one of the greatest bull markets. 
In 1982 and 1983, he advised his subscribers to sell short; those who 
did lost 30 percent in 1982 and then another 25 percent in 1983 as the 
market rose sharply. For 1984 he cited “333 exact parallels with 1929” 
and predicted that a comparable crash would drive the Dow Jones 
Industrial Average below 700 by the spring of 1985. The Dow topped 
1,300 that spring and Granville stubbornly continued predicting a 
Second Great Crash.
The Hulbert Financial Digest, which tracks the performance of in-
vestment newsletters, put Granville dead last over the twenty-five-
year period 1980 to 2005, with an annual return of –20 percent while 
the S&P returned 14 percent a year.
THE DATA MINING TRAP
To many, the value of technical analysis is self-evident. Any reason-
ably alert person can see well-defined patterns in stock prices. How-

ever, investors need a crystal ball, and stock charts provide a rearview 
mirror. In any set of data, even randomly generated data, it is pos-
sible to find a pattern if one looks long enough. 
Ransacking data for patterns is called data mining and demon-
strates little more than the researcher’s persistence. Remember this 
chapter’s opening quotation: “If you torture the data long enough, it 
will confess.”
I once sent ten different charts of stock prices (including Figure 
4-1) to a technical analyst—let’s call him Ed—and asked his help in 
deciding whether any of these stocks looked like promising 
­investments.
Ed was so excited by the patterns he found in four charts that he 
overlooked the odd coincidence that all of the price charts started 
at a price of $50 a share. This was not a coincidence.
These were not real stocks. I created fictitious data from student 
coin flips. In each case, the “price” started at $50 and then each day’s 
price change was determined by twenty-five coin flips, with the 
price going up 50 cents if the coin landed heads and going down 50 
cents if the coin landed tails. For example, fourteen heads and eleven 
tails would be a $1.50 increase that day. After generating dozens of 
charts, I sent ten of them to Ed with the expectation that he would 
find seductive patterns. Sure enough, he did.
When this ruse was revealed, Ed was disappointed that these 
were not real stocks, with real opportunities for profitable buying 
and selling. However, the lesson he drew from this hoax was quite 
different from what I intended. Ed concluded that it is possible to 
use technical analysis to predict coin flips!
PATTERNS IN THE STOCK MARKET
Millions of investors have spent billions of hours trying to discover 
a formula for beating the stock market. It is not surprising that some 
have stumbled on rules that explain the past remarkably well but are 

36      MONEY MACHINE
unsuccessful in predicting the future. Many such systems would be 
laughable, except for the fact that people believe in them.
Analysts have monitored sunspots, the water level of the Great 
Lakes, and sales of aspirin and yellow paint. Some believe that the 
market does especially well in years ending in five—1975, 1985, and 
so on—while others argue that years ending in eight are best. Bur-
ton Crane, a longtime New York Times financial columnist, reported 
that a man “ran a fairly successful investment advisory service based 
in his ‘readings’ of the comic strips in The New York Sun.” Money mag-
azine once reported that a Minneapolis stockbroker selected stocks 
by spreading the Wall Street Journal on the floor and buying the stock 
touched by the first nail on the right paw of his golden retriever. The 
fact that he thought this would attract investors says something 
about him—and his customers.
WHY I LOVE THE PACKERS
On Super Bowl Sunday in January 1983, both the business and sports 
sections of the Los Angeles Times carried articles on the Super Bowl 
stock market predictor. The theory is that the stock market goes up 
if the National Football Conference (NFC) or a former National 
Football League (NFL) team now in the American Football Confer-
ence (AFC) wins the Super Bowl; the market goes down otherwise. 
A Green Bay Packer win is good for the stock market; a New York 
Jets win is bad for stocks.
This theory had been correct for fifteen of the first sixteen Super 
Bowls, and one stockbroker said that “market observers will be glued 
to their TV screens . . . it will be hard to ignore an S&P indicator with 
an accuracy quotient that’s greater than 94 percent.” Washington (an 
NFC team) won, the stock market went up, and the Super Bowl Indi-
cator was back in the news the next year, stronger than ever. The Super 
Bowl system worked an impressive twenty-eight out of thirty-one 
times through 1997, but then failed eight of the next fourteen years.

Torturing Data      37
The stock market has nothing to do with the outcome of a foot-
ball game. The accuracy of the Super Bowl Indicator is nothing 
more than an amusing coincidence fueled by the fact that the stock 
market usually goes up and the NFC usually wins the Super Bowl. 
The correlation is made more impressive by the gimmick of count-
ing the Pittsburgh Steelers, an AFC team, as an NFC team. The ex-
cuse is that Pittsburgh once was in the NFL; the real reason is that 
Pittsburgh won the Super Bowl several times when the stock market 
went up. Counting Pittsburgh as an NFC team twists the data to 
support this cockamamie theory.
The New York Times reversed the direction of the prediction. In-
stead of using the Super Bowl to predict the stock market, why not use 
the stock market to predict the Super Bowl? Why not? It’s no more ri-
diculous than the original Super Bowl Indicator. The Times reported 
that, if the Dow increases between the end of November and the time 
of the Super Bowl, the football team whose city comes second alpha-
betically usually wins. (Hint: Why do you suppose they chose the end 
of November for the starting date, as opposed to January 1, a month 
before the game, a year before the game, or another logical date?)
The performance of the Super Bowl Indicator has been mediocre 
since its discovery—which is unsurprising since there was nothing 
behind it but coincidence. What is genuinely surprising is that many 
people do not get the joke. The man who created the Super Bowl In-
dicator intended it to be a humorous way of demonstrating that cor-
relation does not imply causation. He was flabbergasted when 
people started taking it seriously!
THE FOOLISH FOUR
In 1996, two brothers, Tom and David Gardner, wrote a wildly pop-
ular book with the beguiling name, The Motley Fool Investment Guide: 
How the Fools Beat Wall Street’s Wise Men and How You Can Too. Hey, if 
fools can beat the market, so can we all.

38      MONEY MACHINE
The Gardners recommended the Foolish Four Strategy. They 
claimed that during the years 1973–1993, this strategy had an annual 
average return of 25 percent and concluded that it “should grant its 
fans the same 25 percent annualized returns going forward that it 
has served up in the past.” 
Here’s their recipe for investment riches:
1.	 At the beginning of the year, calculate the dividend yield for 
each of the thirty stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Aver-
age. For example, on December 31, 2013, Coca-Cola stock 
had a price of $41.31 per share and paid an annual dividend of 
$1.12 per share. Coke’s dividend yield was $1.12/$41.31 = 
0.0271, or 2.71 percent.
2.	 Of the thirty Dow stocks, identify the ten stocks with the 
highest dividend yields.
3.	 Of these ten stocks, choose the five stocks with the lowest 
price per share.
4.	 Of these five stocks, cross out the stock with the lowest 
price.
5.	 Invest 40 percent of your wealth in the stock with the next 
lowest price.
6.	 Invest 20 percent of your wealth in each of the other three 
stocks.
No, I’m not making this up.
Any guesses why this strategy is so complicated, verging on baf-
fling? Data mining perhaps?
Steps 1 and 2 are plausible. There is a long-established investment 
strategy called the Dogs of the Dow that favors buying the Dow 
stocks with the highest dividend yields, and this sensible strategy 
has been reasonably successful.
But beyond this kernel of a borrowed idea, the Foolish Four 

Torturing Data      39
Strategy is pure data mining. Step 3 has no logical foundation since 
a stock’s price depends on how many shares the company has out-
standing. If a firm were to double the number of shares, each share 
would be worth half as much. There is no reason why a Dow stock 
with more shares outstanding (and a lower price per share) should be 
a better investment than a Dow stock with fewer shares outstanding 
(and a higher price per share). Berkshire Hathaway (which is not in 
the Dow) has very few shares outstanding and consequently sells for 
a mind-boggling price of nearly $200,000 per share. Yet it has been 
a great investment.
What about step 4? Why, after selecting the five stocks with the 
lowest prices (as if a low price is good), would we cross out the stock 
with the lowest price? Why indeed.
And steps 5 and 6? Why invest twice as much money in the next 
lowest priced stock as in the other three stocks? We all know the an-
swer. Because it worked historically. Period.
Shortly after the Gardners launched the Foolish Four Strategy, 
two skeptical finance professors tested it using data from the years 
1949–1972, just prior to the period that had been data-mined by the 
Gardners. It didn’t work. The professors also retested the strategy 
during the years that were data-mined by the Gardners, but with a 
clever twist. Instead of choosing the portfolio on the first trading 
day in January, they implemented the strategy on the first trading 
day of July. If the strategy has any merit, it shouldn’t be sensitive to 
the starting month. But, of course, it was.
In 1997, only one year after the introduction of the Foolish Four, 
the Gardners tweaked their system and renamed it the UV4. Their 
explanation confirms their data mining: “Why the switch? History 
shows that the UV4 has actually done better than the old Foolish 
Four.” It is hardly surprising that a data-mined strategy doesn’t do as 
well outside the years used to concoct the theory. The Gardners ad-
mitted as much when they stopped recommending both the Foolish 
Four and UV4 strategies in 2000.
The Foolish Four strategy was indeed foolish.

CONVERGENCE TRADES
In the 1980s, an investment advisory firm with the distinguished 
name Hume & Associates produced The Superinvestor Files, which 
were advertised nationally as sophisticated strategies that ordinary 
investors could use to reap extraordinary profits. Subscribers were 
mailed monthly pamphlets, each about fifty pages long and styl-
ishly printed on thick paper, for $25 each plus $2.50 for shipping 
and handling.
In retrospect, it should have been obvious that if these strategies 
were as profitable as advertised, the company could have made more 
money by using the strategies than by selling pamphlets. However, 
gullible and greedy investors overlooked the obvious and, instead, 
hoped that the secret to becoming a millionaire could be purchased 
for $25, plus $2.50 for shipping and handling.
One Superinvestor strategy was based on the gold-silver ratio 
(GSR), which is the ratio of the price of an ounce of gold to the price 
of an ounce of silver. In 1985, the average price of gold was $317.26 
and the average price of silver was $5.88, so the GSR was 317.26/5.88 
= 54, which meant that an ounce of gold cost the same as 54 ounces 
of silver.
In 1986 Hume wrote: 
The [GSR] has fluctuated widely just in the past seven or 
eight years, dipping as low as 19-to-1 in 1980 and soaring as 
high as 52-to-1 in 1982 and 55-to-1 in 1985. But, as you can 
also clearly see, it has always—ALWAYS—returned to the 
range between 34-to-1 and 38-to-1.
Figure 4-2 confirms that the GSR fluctuated around the range of 34 
to 38 during the years 1970 through 1985.

Torturing Data      41
FIGURE 4-2. The GSR 1970–1985
The GSR strategy is to sell gold and buy silver when the GSR is un-
usually high and to do the opposite when the GSR is unusually low. 
Using futures contracts to make these trades creates the potential 
for astonishing profits.
There is no logical reason why an ounce of gold should cost the 
same as 36 ounces of silver. As it turned out, after the GSR went 
above 38 in 1983, it did not come back until twenty-eight years later, 
in 2011. Futures contracts multiply losses as well as gains, and a 1983 
bet on the GSR would have been disastrous.
Figure 4-3 shows that the years when the GSR hovered around 34 
to 36 were a temporary fluke, not the basis for a super strategy.
Modern computers can ransack large databases looking for more 
subtle and complex patterns, but the problem is the same. If there is 
no underlying reason for the discovered pattern, there is no reason 
for deviations from the pattern to self-correct.
The moral is simple: Don’t bet the bank on historical patterns 
that have no logical basis.

COMPUTERIZED TRADING SYSTEMS
Computerized trading systems remove all human judgment. The 
computers are programmed to track stock prices, other economic 
and noneconomic data, and news stories, looking for patterns that 
precede stock price movements. For example, the computers might 
notice that after the number of stocks going down in price during 
the preceding 140 seconds exceeds the number going up by more 
than 8 percentage points, the S&P 500 usually rises.
The computer files this indicator away and waits. When this sig-
nal appears again, the computer moves fast, buying thousands of 
shares in a few seconds and then selling these shares seconds later. 
Done over and over, day after day, a profit of a few pennies (or even 
a fraction of a penny) in a few seconds on thousands of shares can 
add up to real money. The technology magazine Wired gushed that 
these automated systems are “more efficient, faster, and smarter 
than any human.”
True, these programs process data faster than any human, but 
they are no smarter than the humans who write the code that guides

the computers. If a human tells a computer to look for potentially 
profitable patterns—no matter whether the discovered pattern 
makes sense—and to buy or sell when the pattern reappears, the 
computer will do so—whether it makes sense or not. Indeed, some 
of the human brains behind the computers boast that they don’t un-
derstand why their computers decide to trade. After all, their com-
puters are smarter than them, right? Instead of bragging, they should 
be praying.
On May 6, 2010, the U.S. stock market was hit by what has come 
to be known as a “flash crash.” Investors that day were nervous 
about the Greek debt crisis, and an anxious mutual fund manager 
tried to hedge his portfolio by selling $4.1 billion in S&P 500 futures 
contracts. The idea was that if the market dropped, the losses on 
this fund’s stock portfolio would be offset by profits on its futures 
contracts. This seemingly prudent transaction somehow triggered 
the computers. The computers bought many of the futures con-
tracts the fund was selling, then sold them seconds later. Futures 
prices started falling and the computers were provoked into a trad-
ing frenzy as they bought and sold futures contracts among them-
selves, like a hot potato being tossed from hand to hand.
Nobody knows exactly what unleashed the computers. Remem-
ber, even the people behind the computers don’t understand why 
their computers trade. In one fifteen-second interval, the comput-
ers traded 27,000 contracts among themselves, half the total trading 
volume, and ended up with a net purchase of only 200 contracts at 
the end of this fifteen-second madness. The trading frenzy spread to 
the regular stock market, and the flood of sell orders overwhelmed 
potential buyers. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly 600 
points (more than 5 percent) in five minutes. Market prices went 
haywire, yet the computers kept trading. Procter & Gamble (P&G), 
a rock-solid blue-chip company, dropped 37 percent in less than four 
minutes. Some computers paid more than $100,000 a share for 
Apple, Hewlett-Packard, and Sotheby’s. Others sold Accenture and 
other major stocks for less than a penny a share. The computers had 

44      MONEY MACHINE
no common sense. They blindly bought and sold because that’s what 
their algorithms told them to do.
The madness ended when a built-in safeguard in the futures mar-
ket suspended all trading for five seconds. Incredibly, this five-­
second time-out was enough to persuade the computers to stop 
their frenzied trading. Fifteen minutes later, markets were back to 
normal and the temporary 600-point drop in the Dow was just a 
nightmarish memory.
There have been other flash crashes since and there will most 
likely be more in the future. Oddly enough, Procter & Gamble was 
hit again on August 30, 2013, on the New York Stock Exchange 
(NYSE) with a mini flash crash, so called because nothing special 
happened to other stocks on the NYSE and nothing special hap-
pened to P&G stock on other exchanges.
Inexplicably, nearly 200 trades on the NYSE, involving a total of 
about 250,000 shares of P&G stock, occurred within a one-second 
interval, triggering a 5 percent drop in price, from $77.50 to $73.61, 
and then a recovery less than a minute later. One lucky person hap-
pened to be in the right place at the right time and bought 65,000 
shares for a quick $155,000 profit. Why did it happen? No one 
knows. Remember, humans aren’t as smart as computers.
Fortunately, value investors are inoculated from the perils of 
technical analysis, since value investors do not try to predict stock 
prices. Value investors buy a stock because it is an inexpensive 
money machine, generating bountiful cash, it is hoped, over many, 
many years.

BAUBLES AND BUBBLES
When beggars and shoeshine boys, barbers and beauticians can tell you 
how to get rich, it is time to remind yourself that there is no more dan-
gerous illusion than the belief that one can get something for nothing.
—Bernard Baruch
E
arly in my teaching career, a student named Jon told me about 
an exciting investment he was making. All through high school 
he had been collecting postage-stamp plate blocks. At the time, 
stamps were printed fifty stamps to a sheet and a plate block was the 
four stamps in a two-by-two block next to the sheet’s serial number.
Plate blocks were rare because no one had ever thought to save 
them. Then, unexpectedly, plate blocks became a collectible. Prices 
rose rapidly and Jon joined others in the gold rush. Every time a new 
stamp came out, Jon went to his local post office and bought several 
plate blocks. Sometimes, he bought complete fifty-stamp sheets in 
case these, too, became collectible. He kept his stamps in mint con-
dition by storing them in protective plastic sleeves in binders. He 
proudly told me that he had several thousand dollars “invested.”
I told Jon that this was speculation, not investing, because his 
stamps didn’t generate any income. Jon insisted that it was an in-
vestment because prices had been going up. Indeed, the plate-block 
market was doing better than the stock market. Seeing that I was 
getting nowhere, I said, “Twenty years from now, let me know how 
it works out.”

46      MONEY MACHINE
Roughly twenty years later I got a large envelope in the mail from 
Jon. He told me about his career as a portfolio manager and thanked 
me for the class he had taken from me. The postage on the envelope 
consisted of dozens of stamps, shown in Figure 5-1. The plate-block 
market had collapsed and this was Jon’s way of saying that I was right.
When Jon tried to liquidate his stamp collection, dealers offered 
him $9 for every $10 of face value. Nobody wanted to buy the stamps 
for anything other than mailing letters and dealers didn’t want to tie 
their money up in inventory that wasn’t moving. Jon was stubborn, so 
he kept his stamps and was liquidating his collection letter by ­letter.
FIGURE 5-1. The risks of speculation
Baseball cards are another collectible. For many years, baseball cards 
were advertising giveaways or sold with cigars, cigarettes, and bub-
ble gum. Children traded cards, played games with them, and stuck 
them in their bicycle spokes to make motorcycle sounds. Then 
grown-ups decided that baseball cards were a collectible, too valu-
able to be touched, let alone played with. They were convinced that 
they could get rich buying baseball cards for pennies and selling 
them a few years later for dollars.

Baubles and Bubbles      47
Eventually, the market for new cards crashed. However, old cards 
are still considered valuable—simply because they are rare. In 2007 
a collector paid $2.8 million for a 1909 Honus Wagner card that had 
originally been included in a cigarette pack. Wagner reportedly did 
not smoke and asked the company not to distribute the cards be-
cause he did not want children to buy cigarettes. Only about 200 
cards were printed and, of these, only fifty or so were distributed. At 
the time of the 2007 auction, it was thought that only three cards 
had survived, but more have since surfaced.
Does this card’s rarity make it worth millions of dollars? No. 
Baseball cards have no intrinsic value because they generate no 
cash whatsoever. Yet some people believe that rare cards have value 
because they are rare. It’s sort of like people being famous for 
being famous. There is no rational explanation. Rarity does not 
make something valuable.
A former student sent me a collection of cards that are rarer than 
baseball cards that are thought to be worth thousands of dollars. 
These are economics trading cards distributed by the economics 
club at the University of Michigan, Flint. Each card has a picture of 
a famous economist on the front and some lifetime statistics on the 
back. The James Tobin card (see Figure 5-2) says he was born in 
Champaign, Illinois, in 1918, and received his bachelor’s degree and 
PhD from Harvard in 1939 and 1947 (interrupted by military duty 
during World War II).

There is a summary of his research and a memorable quotation:
I studied economics and made it my career for two reasons. 
The subject was and is intellectually fascinating and chal-
lenging, particularly to someone with taste and talent for 
theoretical reasoning and quantitative analysis. At the same 
time it offered the hope, as it still does, that improved un-
derstanding could better the lot of mankind.
If you are interested, make me an offer. Remember, this card is 
VERY rare.
Some people believe in the Latin saying, Res tantum valet quantum 
vendi potest: A thing is worth only what someone else will pay for it. 
That’s like many of the quotations attributed to former baseball 
player and manager Yogi Berra; for example, “It’s not over until it’s 
over.” It is literally true, but so circular as to be meaningless. Yes, 
something is worth what someone is willing to pay for it, if by 
“worth” you mean the price people pay is the price they are willing 
to pay. Investors think differently. As John Burr Williams said, “A 
stock is worth only what you can get out of it.”
What do you get out of looking at a postage stamp or a baseball 
card or any other so-called collectible? A collector who paid $250,000 
for an early Batman comic explained that he keeps the comic in an 
airtight bag in a bank vault: “I’ve been toying with the idea of read-
ing it, but I haven’t yet.”
BEANIE BABIES
Beanie Babies are stuffed animals with a heart-shaped hang tag. The 
beanie name refers to the fact that these toys are filled with plastic 
pellets (“beans”). Around 1995, the same time the dot-com bubble 
was inflating, Beanie Babies came to be viewed as collectibles be-
cause buyers expected to profit from escalating Beanie Baby prices 
by selling these silly bears to an endless supply of greater fools. 

Baubles and Bubbles      49
­Delusional grown-ups stockpiled Beanie Babies, thinking that they 
would pay for their retirement or their kids’ college education. Ah, 
good plan.
What is the intrinsic value of a Beanie Baby? It doesn’t pay divi-
dends. It doesn’t pay anything! You can’t even play with a Beanie 
Baby. To preserve its value as a collectible, a Beanie Baby must be 
stored in an airtight containers in a cool, dark, smoke-free environ-
ment. Yet the hopeful and the greedy paid hundreds of dollars for 
Beanie Babies that originally sold in toy stores for a few dollars. 
They saw how much prices had increased in the past and assumed 
the same would be true in the future. They had no reason for believ-
ing this, but they wanted to believe.
Figure 5-3 shows the Princess Beanie Baby honoring Diana, the 
Princess of Wales. The Princess sold for $500 in 2000. Then the 
bubble popped. I bought this bear on the internet in 2008. The 
shipping cost more than the bear.

PONZI SCHEMES
If you mail a letter to a person in another country, you can enclose 
an international reply coupon that can be exchanged for postage 
stamps in that country and used to mail a letter back to you. It is like 
enclosing a self-addressed stamped envelope, but gets around the 
problem of the sender having to buy foreign postage stamps. It is 
the polite thing to do, but also the source of the most famous swin-
dle in history.
In 1920, a Massachusetts man named Charles Ponzi promised to 
pay investors 50 percent interest every forty-five days. Compounded 
eight times a year, the effective annual rate of return would be 2,463 
percent! He said that his profits would come from taking advantage 
of the difference between the official and open market price of 
Spanish pesos. He would buy Spanish pesos cheap in the open mar-
ket, use these pesos to buy international reply coupons, and then 
trade these coupons for U.S. postage stamps at the higher official ex-
change rate. If everything worked as planned, he could buy 10 cents’ 
worth of U.S. postage stamps for a penny. (It was not clear how he 
would convert these stamps into cash.) In practice, he received $15 
million from investors and appears to have bought only $61 in 
stamps.
If he didn’t invest any money, how could he afford to pay a 50 
percent return every forty-five days? He couldn’t. But he could cre-
ate a temporary illusion of doing so. Suppose that a person invests 
$100, which Ponzi spends on himself. If Ponzi now finds two peo-
ple to invest $100 apiece, he can give the first person $150, and 
keep $50 for himself. Now, he has forty-five days to find four peo-
ple willing to invest $100 so that he can pay each of the two previ-
ous investors $150 and spend $100 on himself. These four can be 
paid with the money from eight new investors, and these eight 
from sixteen more.

Baubles and Bubbles      51
THE FALLACY
Ponzi’s legacy is the Ponzi scheme. In a Ponzi scheme, money from 
new investors is paid to earlier ones, and it works as long as there are 
enough new investors. The problem is that the pool of fish is ex-
hausted surprisingly soon. The twenty-first round requires a million 
new people and the thirtieth round requires a billion more. At some 
point, the scheme runs out of new people and those in the last round 
(the majority of the investors) are left with nothing. A Ponzi scheme 
merely transfers wealth from late entrants to early entrants (and to 
the person running the scam).
Ponzi’s scam collapsed after eight months when a Boston news-
paper discovered that during the time that he supposedly bought 
$15 million in postage coupons, the total amount sold worldwide 
came to only $1 million. Ponzi promised that he could pay off his in-
vestors by starting a company and selling stock to other investors. 
Massachusetts officials were unpersuaded. They sent Ponzi to jail 
for ten years.
A Ponzi scheme is also called a pyramid deal, since its workings 
can be visualized by imagining a pyramid with the initial investors at 
the top and the most recent round on the bottom; the pyramid col-
lapses when the next round doesn’t materialize. Even though it 
seems obvious that no one will make money unless others lose 
money, greed blinds participants to the likelihood that they will be 
among the losers.
INVESTMENTS THAT WERE  
TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE
Ponzi schemes are illegal frauds, but they usually disguise their true 
nature by promising to channel investors’ money to a unique invest-
ment or to a fabulous money manager. Our best protection is sober 
reflection and common sense. If it looks too good to be true, it 

52      MONEY MACHINE
probably isn’t true. But greed is a powerful emotion and often tram-
ples common sense. One of the most notorious cases involved Ber-
nie Madoff.
For more than a decade, Madoff told investors—many of them 
Jewish charitable organizations—that he was earning double-digit 
returns year after year using a “split-strike conversion” strategy that 
involves buying stock and put options and writing call options. This 
is actually a conservative strategy that is unlikely to generate double-
digit returns. Perhaps even more suspiciously, Madoff reported neg-
ative returns in only seven months over a fourteen-year period. 
Skeptics looked at the ups and downs in the S&P and concluded 
that Madoff’s performance claims were mathematically impossible. 
To true believers, this added to his mystique. One of his clients 
raved, “Even knowledgeable people can’t really tell you what he’s 
doing.”
What he was doing was running a Ponzi scheme, the largest ever. 
In December 2008, Madoff was having severe liquidity problems 
and confessed to his sons that it was “one big lie,” a Ponzi scheme 
that was collapsing. His sons reported his confession to the govern-
ment. Madoff was arrested and, four months later, pleaded guilty to 
eleven felonies. He admitted that he had not made any real invest-
ments for nearly two decades and that there was a $65 billion short-
fall between what his clients thought they had in their accounts and 
what they actually had. Once the lawyers had been paid, investors 
got back $10 billion less than their original investment.
Madoff was sentenced to 150 years in prison and sent to a federal 
facility in North Carolina. He told a relative, “It’s much safer here 
than walking the streets of New York.”
SPECULATIVE BUBBLES AND PANICS
From time to time, investors are gripped by what, in retrospect, 
seems to have been mass hysteria. The price of something climbs 

Baubles and Bubbles      53
higher and higher, beyond all reason, but it’s a speculative bubble 
because nothing justifies the rising price except the hope that it will 
go higher still. Then, suddenly, the bubble pops, buyers vanish, and 
the price collapses. With hindsight, it is hard to see how people 
could have been so foolish and paid such crazy prices. Yet, at the 
time of the bubble, it seems foolish to sit on the sidelines while oth-
ers become rich.
Some people, including Nobel laureate Eugene Fama, do not 
think that bubbles can even occur. They argue that since markets al-
ways set the correct prices, whatever prices those markets set must 
be correct.
It is hard to take this circular argument seriously if we define a 
bubble as a situation in which the price cannot be justified by an as-
set’s intrinsic value, but is instead propelled by a belief that the price 
will keep rising. When a Beanie Baby sold for $500, was that not a 
bubble? What rational explanation are we overlooking?
In 2013 Fama accepted that a bubble is “an extended period dur-
ing which asset prices depart quite significantly from economic fun-
damentals.” Yet, he danced around this definition when he argued 
the following: 
The word “bubble” drives me nuts, frankly, because I don’t 
think there’s anything in the statistical evidence that says 
anybody can reliably predict when prices go down. So if you 
interpret the word “bubble” to mean I can predict when 
prices are going to go down, you can’t do it. . . .
I believe markets work. And if markets work those things 
shouldn’t be predictable. If I can predict that housing prices 
will go down, if the market’s working properly, they should 
go down now. . . . If the market’s working properly, the infor-
mation should be in the prices.
The argument that prices sometimes go far above intrinsic value 
does not require that we know when prices will crash. Indeed, the 
essence of a bubble is that people do not know when it will pop. 

54      MONEY MACHINE
Fama is correct in arguing that if people know that prices will go 
down tomorrow, prices will go down today. But he is wrong in argu-
ing that bubbles must be predictable. And he is wrong in arguing 
that the fact that price changes are hard to predict proves that prices 
are always equal to intrinsic values. Price changes might be hard to 
predict because they are swayed by irrational, unpredictable 
­emotions.
THE SOUTH SEA BUBBLE
In 1720, the British government gave the South Sea Company exclu-
sive trading privileges with Spain’s American colonies. None of the 
company’s directors had ever been to America, nor had they any 
concrete plans to trade anything. Nonetheless, encouraged by the 
company’s inventive bookkeeping, English citizens rushed to invest 
in this exotic venture. As the price of the South Sea Company’s 
stock soared from £120 on January 28 to £400 on May 19, then £800 
on June 4, and £1,000 on June 22, some people became rich and 
thousands rushed to join their ranks. It was said that you could buy 
South Sea stock as you entered Garraway’s coffeehouse and sell it 
for a profit on the way out.
Soon con men were offering stock in even more grandiose 
schemes and were deluged by frantic investors not wanting to be left 
out. It scarcely mattered what the scheme was. One promised to 
build a wheel for perpetual motion. Another was formed “for carry-
ing on an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody is to know 
what it is.” The shares for this mysterious offering were priced at 
£100 each, with a promised annual return of £100; after selling all of 
the stock in less than five hours, the promoter left England and 
never returned. Yet another stock offer was for the “nitvender” or 
selling of nothing. Yet, nitwits bought nitvenders. When the South 
Sea Bubble burst, fortunes and dreams disappeared.
As with all speculative bubbles, there were many believers in the 

Baubles and Bubbles      55
Greater Fool Theory. While some suspected that prices were unrea-
sonable, the market was dominated by people believing that prices 
would continue to rise, at least until they could sell to the next fool 
in line. In the spring of 1720, Sir Isaac Newton said, “I can calculate 
the motions of the heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people,” 
and sold his South Sea shares for a £7,000 profit. But later that year, 
he bought shares again, just before the bubble burst, and lost 
£20,000. When a banker invested £500 in the third offering of 
South Sea stock, he explained that “when the rest of the world are 
mad, we must imitate them in some measure.” After James Milner, a 
member of the British Parliament, was bankrupted by the South Sea 
Bubble, he explained that “I said, indeed, that ruin must soon come 
upon us but . . . it came two months sooner than I expected.”
Yes, no one knows for certain when a bubble will pop, but that 
does not mean that a bubble is not a bubble. The price of nitvender 
stock was no more related to economic fundamentals than was the 
price of the Princess Beanie Baby.
THE DOT-COM BUBBLE
It is hard to imagine life without the internet—without email, 
Google, and Wikipedia at our fingertips. When the electricity goes 
out or we go on vacation, internet withdrawal pains can be over-
whelming. Cell phones only heighten our addiction. Do we really 
need to be online and on call 24/7? Must we respond immediately to 
every email, text, and tweet? Do we really need to know what our 
friends are eating for lunch? Apparently we do.
Back in the 1990s, when computers and cell phones were just 
starting to take over our lives, the spread of the internet sparked the 
creation of hundreds of online companies, popularly known as dot-
coms. Some dot-coms had good ideas and matured into strong, suc-
cessful companies. But many did not. In too many cases, the idea 
was simply to start a company with a dot-com in its name, sell it to 

56      MONEY MACHINE
someone else, and walk away with pockets full of cash. It was so Old 
Economy to have a great idea, start a company, make it a successful 
business, and turn it over to your children and grandchildren.
One study found that companies that did nothing more than add 
.com, .net, or the word “internet” to their names more than doubled 
the price of their stock. Money for nothing!
A dot-com company proved it was a player not by making a profit 
but by spending money—preferably other people’s money. (I’m not 
joking!) One rationale was to be the first-mover by getting big fast. 
(A popular saying was “Get large or get lost.”) The idea was that 
once people believe that your website is the place to go to buy some-
thing, sell something, or learn something, you have a monopoly that 
can crush the competition and reap profits.
It is not a completely idiotic idea. It sometimes even works. 
(Think Amazon.) Often it doesn’t. Can you name the first-movers in 
the personal computer revolution? (Apple survived, but Commo-
dore, Kaypro, and Tandy are answers to trivia questions.)
The fundamental problem is that there were thousands of dot-
com companies and there isn’t room for thousands of monopolies. 
Of the thousands of companies trying to get big fast, very few can 
ever be monopolies.
Most dot-com companies had no profits. If investors had thought 
about stocks as money machines and noticed how little cash was 
being generated, they would have been skeptical rather than deliri-
ous. Instead, wishful investors thought up new metrics for the so-
called New Economy to justify ever higher stock prices. They argued 
that instead of being obsessed with something as old-fashioned as 
profits, we should look at a company’s sales, spending, and number 
of website visitors. Companies responded by finding creative ways 
to give investors what they wanted. Investors want more sales? I’ll 
sell something to your company and you sell it back to me. No prof-
its for either of us, but higher sales for both of us. Investors want 
more spending? Order another thousand Aeron chairs. Investors 
want more website visitors? Give stuff away to people who visit your 

Baubles and Bubbles      57
website. Buy Super Bowl ads that advertise your website. Two dozen 
dot-com companies ran ads during the January 2000 Super Bowl 
game, at a cost of $2.2 million for thirty seconds of ad time, plus the 
cost of producing the ad. Companies didn’t need profits. They 
needed traffic.
One measure of traffic was eyeballs, the number of people who 
visited a page; another was the number of people who stayed for at 
least three minutes. Even more fanciful was hits, the number of files 
requested when a web page is downloaded from a server. Companies 
put dozens of images on a page, and each image loaded from the 
server counted as a hit. Incredibly, investors thought this meant 
something important. They should have been thinking about money 
machines.
Stock prices tripled between 1995 and 2000, an annual rate of in-
crease of 25 percent. Dot-com stocks rose even more. The tech-
heavy NASDAQ index more than quintupled during this five-year 
period, an annual rate of increase of 40 percent. Someone who 
bought $10,000 of AOL stock in January 1995 or Yahoo when it 
went public in April 1996 would have had nearly $1 million in Janu-
ary 2000.
In 1999, a small internet company called NetJ.com filed an SEC 
statement that was brutally candid: “The company is not currently 
engaged in any substantial business activity and has no plans to en-
gage in any such activity in the foreseeable future.” A modern nitv-
ender! And yet the price rose from $0.50 a share to $3.50 a share in 
six months. A company that doesn’t do anything or plan to do any-
thing was valued at $22.9 million—not much for a real company, but 
a lot for a do-nothing company.
In March 2000, the Wall Street Journal ran a front-page story that 
reminded me of Bernard Baruch’s comment about barbers and beau-
ticians. At Bill’s Barbershop in Dennis, Massachusetts, a shop I’ve 
been to, the locals talked about dot-com stocks while they watched 
stock prices dance on television. One regular said, “You get three or 
four times in your life to make serious bucks. If you miss this one, 

58      MONEY MACHINE
you’re crazy.” Another agreed: “I don’t think anything could shake 
my confidence in the market. Even if we do go down 30 percent, 
we’ll just come right back.”
Dot-com entrepreneurs and stock market investors were getting 
rich and they wanted to think that it would never end. But, of course, 
it did.
THE 36K NONSENSE
Chapter 1 recounted my warnings, delivered at a March 11, 2000, 
conference, on the Glassman-Hassett prediction that the Dow 
Jones Industrial Average would more than triple, from below 12,000 
to 36,000. 
How did I know that the 36K prediction was nonsense? I looked 
at their reasoning. The total return from a stock is the dividend 
yield (the dividend D divided by the price P) plus the capital gains g 
(the percentage change in the price).

Suppose that a representative stock at the time was selling for $12 a 
share and paid an annual dividend of $0.18. The dividend yield would 
be 1.5 percent:
=
=

Glassman-Hassett assumed that, in the long run, dividends and 
stock prices will grow by 5 percent a year, which is perfectly reason-
able and implies a total stock return of 1.5 + 5.0 = 6.5 percent. They 
noted that, at the time, the interest rate on long-term Treasury 
bonds was 5.5 percent.
Now the trouble starts. Glassman-Hassett argued that investors 
should be happy to hold stocks if the anticipated returns were only 

Baubles and Bubbles      59
5.5 percent, the same as Treasury bonds, because stocks are safer 
than Treasury bonds—as evidenced by the fact that stocks, on av-
erage, have done better than Treasury bonds in the past. Not only 
that, because stocks are safer, they reasoned that investors should 
hold stocks happily if the anticipated returns were less than 5.5 
­percent.
Nonetheless, they made the “conservative” assumption that 
stocks should be priced to give a 5.5 percent return, consisting of a 
0.5 percent dividend yield plus 5.0 percent growth. For the dividend 
yield to fall from 1.5 percent to 0.5 percent, the stock price has to be 
three times as high ($36 rather than $12):
=
=
D
P
$0.18
$36.00

Thus, they concluded that stock prices should triple, from $12 to 
$36 (or, in the case of the Dow, from 12,000 to 36,000).
The crucial assumption is clearly that investors would be satis-
fied with the same anticipated returns on stocks and bonds because 
stocks are as safe, or safer, than bonds. However, the fact that stocks 
have beaten bonds in the past does not guarantee that stocks will 
beat bonds in the future. The extraordinary twentieth-century per-
formance of the U.S. stock market was, most likely, a surprise—and 
we can’t count on another hundred years of pleasant surprises.
Their model is also internally inconsistent. Glassman and Has-
sett argued that because stocks always outperform bonds, stocks 
should be priced to do the same as bonds—in which case, stocks 
won’t outperform bonds.
The second inconsistency involves what happens in their model 
if the Treasury rate goes up to, say, 6 percent, which it did a few 
months after their book Dow 36,000 appeared. For the anticipated 
stock return to increase from 5.5 percent to 6 percent, the dividend 
yield would have to double from 0.5 percent to 1.0 percent. For 
this to happen, the stock price would have to fall 50 percent, from 
$36 to $18:

P

How can any sane person argue that stocks are as safe as bonds if a 
half-percentage-point increase in interest rates causes stock prices 
to fall 50 percent? Nor can we rely on a hypothetical “long run” to 
save the day for stocks. Their model implies that if interest rates 
increase permanently, stocks will be a permanently disastrous 
­investment.
A value investor would have recognized the dot-com bubble for 
what it was—a bubble. The 12,000 value of the Dow gave a 1.5 per-
cent dividend yield and a predicted 6.5 percent stock return, a slim 
one percent risk premium over bonds. I argued at the time that a 
reasonable risk premium should be higher and stock prices should 
be lower—much lower—though I didn’t know when the dot-com 
bubble would burst.
I reached the same conclusion using a different model (which is 
explained in Chapter 6).
After the dot-com bubble popped, the Wall Street Journal made 
another visit to Bill’s Barbershop. Bill was now sixty-three years old 
and his retirement portfolio had been decimated. His $834,000 was 
down to $103,000, which was $50,000 less than his initial invest-
ment: “It means that I’m looking at another ten years of work, in-
stead of being retired,” he said. Bill had given up playing the stock 
market. Now, he was playing blackjack and poker at a Connecticut 
casino and said, “I do better there than I do in the market.” Which 
isn’t saying much.

INTRINSIC VALUE
­Investors should buy stocks as if they were groceries instead of perfume.
—Benjamin Graham
W
hen we buy groceries, clothing, or a television, we ask not 
only whether the food is tasty, the clothing attractive, and 
the television well built, but how much it costs. Is it worth the price? 
When we buy stock, we should ask the same question—not whether 
it is issued by a good company, but whether the price is right. Is it 
worth the cost? The relevant question is not whether Amazon is a 
better company than Target, but whether Amazon stock, at $800 a 
share, is a better buy than Target stock at $80 a share.
What is a share of stock worth? We do not buy stock to eat, wear, 
or watch at night. We buy stock for the cash it generates: the divi-
dends. This insight is the basis of value investing.
Value investors buy stock with the expectation that, even if they 
never sell the stock, they will be satisfied with the dividends they ex-
pect to receive. Value investors don’t invest in postage stamps, base-
ball cards, or Beanie Babies because they don’t generate income. 
John Burr Williams, a Harvard economist temporarily turned poet, 
wrote:
A cow for her milk
A hen for her eggs
And a stock, by heck
For her dividends.

62      MONEY MACHINE
An orchard for fruit
Bees, for their honey
And stock, besides,
For their dividends.
It would be a mistake “to buy a cow for her cud or bees for their 
buzz.”
If a city slicker comes to your farm and offers a low price for your 
cow, you ignore him. You bought the cow for the milk, not to sell to 
city slickers. If the city slicker returns the next day and offers a ri-
diculously high price, more than the milk is worth, you take advan-
tage of his ignorance.
In the same way, Benjamin Graham created an imaginary Mr. 
Market, a person who comes by every day offering to buy the stock 
you own or to sell you more shares. Sometimes, Mr. Market’s price 
is reasonable. Other times, it is silly. There is no reason for your as-
sessment of your stock to be swayed by Mr. Market’s prices, though 
you may sometimes take advantage of his foolishness.
MR. MARKET IS FICKLE,  
AND THAT’S A GOOD THING
Figure 6-1 shows the daily Dow Jones Industrial Average from Au-
gust 26, 2015, to August 25, 2016. I am writing this on August 26, 
2016, so the figure reflects the most recent fifty-two-week period I 
have available. I scaled the Dow to equal 100 on August 26, 2015, so 
that percentage changes can be gauged by comparing the daily prices 
to 100.
The Dow was up about 15 percent over this fifty-two-week pe-
riod, but its volatility is even more interesting. The Dow went up 12 
percent in the five weeks between September 28, 2015, and Novem-
ber 3, 2015, then fell 14 percent during the next three months, fol-
lowed by a 16 percent increase in the two months after that.

FIGURE 6-1. Dow Jones Industrial Average, August 26, 2015, to August 25, 2016
The Dow is an average of the prices of thirty prominent blue-
chip stocks. In the words of Dow Jones & Company, these are “sub-
stantial companies—renowned for the quality and wide acceptance 
of their products or services—with strong histories of successful 
growth.” The intrinsic value of these bluest of blue-chip companies 
surely did not go up or down by double-digit amounts every few 
months. Yet their stock prices did.
And this is the average of the prices of thirty blue-chip stocks. 
Swings in individual stock prices can be even wilder. Pick any of the 
Dow stocks at random and look at its high and low prices over the 
preceding fifty-two weeks. Seriously, take a break from reading this 
book and find a list of the thirty Dow stocks. Pick one at random. 
Then go to a finance website and look at the fifty-two-week high 
and low prices for this stock. Now ask yourself if it is reasonable 
that the real value of this company would vary so much in one year’s 
time.
I did the same exercise. I used a random number generator to 
pick a number between 1 and 30. The number selected was 21, so I 
looked at Nike, the twenty-first stock in the Dow list when the

in seven months.
But wait, there’s more. Figure 6-2 shows Nike’s price between

Nike stock, although the intrinsic value of the company surely did 
not go up, down, up, down by 20 percent in a manner of months—
not to mention the 5 to 10 percent zigs and zags from one week to 
the next. On February 1, Mr. Market said that Nike was worth $99 
billion. A week later, Mr. Market announced that Nike was now 
worth $85 billion. Two weeks later, Mr. Market changed his mind, 
now proclaiming that Nike was again worth $99 billion. Mr. Market 
is nuts.

fickleness may create rewarding opportunities for value investors 
looking to buy good stocks at bargain prices. Instead of bemoaning 
Mr. Market’s fickleness, we should embrace it.
THE PRESENT VALUE OF DIVIDENDS
John Burr Williams and Benjamin Graham were both teaching us to 
form our own opinions of what a stock is worth, based on the in-
come it generates, not on the daily fluctuations in stock prices. Sim-
ilarly, Warren Buffett suggested that we think of stocks as disguised 
bonds so that we will value stocks by looking at their dividends the 
same way we value bonds by looking at their coupons. 
Let’s assume, as do John Burr Williams, Benjamin Graham, and 
Warren Buffett, that we plan to hold the stock forever. Even though 
this is not literally true, it forces us to think about the cash gener-
ated by the company instead of guessing whether Mr. Market’s price 
tomorrow will be higher or lower than his price today.
Consider a stock that will pay a $10 dividend one year from today. 
(Companies usually pay dividends quarterly; for simplicity, we as-
sume annual dividends.) How much would you pay for this $10? 
Somewhat less than $10, because if you had the $10 today, you could 
invest it for a year and have more than $10. This is the time value of 
money: A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow.
Looking at other ways you might invest your money, you may de-
cide that you do not want to buy this $10 dividend unless it gives you 
a 5 percent return. If so, the highest price you are willing to pay is 
$9.52 because that would give you your 5 percent required return. 
Paying $9.52 for a $10 dividend is a 48-cent profit, which is a 5 per-
cent return on your $9.52 investment:

The $10 dividend one year from now is worth $9.52 to you today.
If your required return were 10 percent, you would be willing  
to pay $9.09 today for a $10 dividend a year from now because 
your profit would be 91 cents, a 10 percent return on your $9.09 
­investment:

The higher your required return, the less the dividend is worth. This 
makes sense. The only way you can get a higher return from a $10 
dividend is if you can buy it for a lower price.
The math is more complicated for dividends further into the fu-
ture, but the principle is the same. The present value of future cash is 
how much you are willing to pay today for cash that you have to wait 
to receive in the future.*
A former student who is now a fund manager told me that if you 
understand present value, you’ll understand 90 percent of investing. 
That’s an exaggeration, but like all good exaggerations, there is 
truth to it. An understanding of present value is indispensable for 
informed investment decisions.
The right way to think about a prospective investment is to con-
sider the cash it will generate and then discount this cash by a re-
quired return that takes into account the time value of money. This 
simple idea is the cornerstone of value investing.
Because you are acting as if you are going to hold a stock forever 
and receive dividends forever, the stock’s intrinsic value is the pres-
ent value of these dividends. The intrinsic value does not depend on 
predictions about what the stock’s price will be tomorrow or a year 
from now. 
The only market price that matters is today’s price. A stock is 
worth buying if Mr. Market’s price today is lower than the stock’s in-
trinsic value, and the bigger the gap, the bigger the appeal.
*Here’s the math. The present value of $1 received n years from now is $1/(1 + R)n, 
where R is the required return.

Intrinsic Value      67
To implement the intrinsic-value model, we need to specify the 
future dividends and a required return, what Williams called an in-
vestor’s “personal rate of interest.” The required return for stocks 
surely depends on the returns available on other investments, such 
as Treasury bonds. Suppose that the interest rate on Treasury bonds 
is 5 percent. Stocks are riskier than Treasury bonds because stock 
dividends are less certain than Treasury coupons. Risk-averse inves-
tors will consequently have a higher required return. How much 
higher? Some investors, looking back over the last 100 years, see 
that the average return on U.S. stocks has been some 5 to 7 percent 
higher than the average return on Treasury bonds and conclude that 
the risk premium going forward must be around 5 to 7 percent. 
However, we shouldn’t use after-the-fact returns to estimate before-
the-event preferences, because U.S. stock returns over the past sev-
eral decades probably turned out to be much higher than investors 
anticipated at the time.
A study of the twentieth-century performance of stock markets 
in thirty-nine different countries found that the U.S. stock market 
beat all the rest. It seems unlikely that investors worldwide knew 
that the twentieth century would turn out to be America’s century 
and the U.S. stock market would turn out to be the winner. If they 
had known that, they would have bought U.S. stocks instead of other 
stocks. It is more likely that the remarkable performance of the U.S. 
stock market was a pleasant surprise to investors who owned U.S. 
stocks.
The question going forward is how much of a risk premium you 
require. If long-term Treasury bonds pay 5 percent, would you be 
satisfied with a 12 percent anticipated return from stocks? Most 
likely. What about 10 percent? Or 8 percent? It’s your call and it has 
nothing to do with how well the U.S. stock market has done over the 
past hundred years.

Investors often predict future dividends by assuming that dividends 
grow at a steady rate each year. In this case, a stock’s intrinsic value 
(the present value of all its future dividends) is given by an equation 
derived by John Burr Williams, which I call the JBW equation: 
V
D
R
g
=
−
The intrinsic value V is equal to the current dividend D, divided by 
the shareholders’ required return R minus the dividend growth rate 
g. Suppose the dividend is $5 and the required return is 10 percent. 
If dividends grow at 5 percent, the intrinsic value is $100:
V
$5
0.10
0.05
$100
=
−
=
Dividends never grow at a perfectly constant rate, but the JBW 
equation is a reasonable approximation with logical implications.
First, it makes sense. Suppose you buy the stock for $100. The 
initial $5 dividend is a 5 percent return on your $100 investment. If 
dividends grow by 5 percent, the dividend will be $5.25 next year and 
the stock’s value will be $105:
V
$5.25
0.10
0.05
$105
=
−
=
You get a 5 percent dividend and a 5 percent increase in the stock’s 
value, which gives you a 10 percent total return. Year after year, the 
dividend and value grow by 5 percent, keeping the dividend yield at 
5 percent and increasing the value of your investment by 5 percent. 
Year after year, you get a 10 percent return.
Think about this for a moment, because it is very important and 
yet not always fully appreciated. If you buy a stock with, say, a 3 per-
cent dividend yield, and the dividends grow by 5 percent a year, a 

Intrinsic Value      69
reasonable estimate of your long-run return is 8 percent. The JBW 
equation makes no assumptions about future stock prices; it as-
sumes that you never sell. However, the model is internally consis-
tent in that if you do sell and market prices grow at the same rate as 
dividends, your total return, dividends plus capital gains, will equal 
your required return.
THE VALUE OF GROWTH
The JBW equation also demonstrates how important the growth 
rate is to the value of a stock. At a 10 percent required return, a 
stock paying a $5 dividend has an intrinsic value of $50 if there is no 
growth and an intrinsic value of $100 with 5 percent growth. The in-
trinsic values for other growth rates are shown in Table 6-1.
Growth makes a big difference because of the power of com-
pounding. The difference between zero and 5 percent growth may 
not sound like much; but fifty years down the road, the first com-
pany will still be paying a $5 dividend while the second pays a $57 
dividend.

This logic explains the lure of growth stocks, companies with high 
anticipated growth rates. The logic works in reverse, too. Some-
times, a company with bright prospects announces an earnings in-
crease and its stock price free-falls downward. Why? Because the 
announced increase in earnings was not as large as had been antici-
pated, and small differences in growth rates can make a big differ-
ence to the value of a company’s stock. In Table 6-1, a scaling down 
of growth prospects from 8 percent to 6 percent cuts the intrinsic 
value in half.
A particularly dramatic example happened to Oracle, a software 
powerhouse, on December 9, 1997. Analysts had been expecting Or-
acle’s second-quarter sales to be 35 percent higher than a year earlier 
and its profits to be 25 percent higher. After the market closed on 
December 8, Oracle reported that its second-quarter sales were only 
23 percent higher than a year earlier and its profits were only 4 per-
cent higher. The next day, 171.8 million Oracle shares were traded, 
more than one-sixth of all Oracle shares outstanding, and the stock’s 
price fell 29 percent, reducing Oracle’s total market value by more 
than $9 billion.
As is so often the case, Mr. Market overreacted. The annual re-
turn on Oracle stock over the next sixteen years, through December 
31, 2013, was 15.8 percent, compared to 4.1 percent for the S&P 500. 
A $10,000 investment in Oracle the day after its 1997 crash would 
have grown to $105,000 compared to $19,000 for the S&P 500.
A more prolonged example involved Disney, a favored growth 
stock that fell from a high of $122 on January 19, 1973, to $17.50 on 
December 17, 1974, even while its earnings were increasing. Its 1973 
earnings of $1.64 a share were 16 percent above 1972’s $1.41 earnings, 
but below analysts’ optimistic $1.80 to $2.00 predictions. Even the 
revised predictions of $1.95 for 1974 proved to be optimistic, as 
earnings only increased slightly, to $1.66. Recession, inflation, and 
the energy crisis took their toll, but worst of all was the fear that 
Disney had changed from a glamorous growth stock into something 
a bit more mature and much less exciting.

Intrinsic Value      71
This, too, proved to be an overreaction. If you had invested 
$10,000 in Disney on December 31, 1974, at a slightly recovered 
price of $21.375, you would have earned 15.5 percent a year through 
December 31, 2013, and your investment would have been worth 
$2.77 million, compared to 8.8 percent and $270,000 for the S&P 
500.
More recently, on January 24, 2013, Apple reported a record quar-
terly profit of $13.1 billion, selling 28 percent more iPhones and 48 
percent more iPads than a year earlier, but the stock dropped more 
than 12 percent, reducing its market value by $50 billion. Apple had 
sold a record 47.8 million iPhones, but this was less than the consen-
sus forecast of 50 million. Earnings per share were higher than fore-
casted ($13.81 versus $13.44), and so was revenue ($54.7 billion versus 
$54.5 billion), but investors were used to Apple clobbering forecasts. 
A bit of a paradox here. If analysts expected Apple to beat their 
forecasts, why didn’t they raise their forecasts? In any case, Mr. Mar-
ket was scared and the price plunged. Will this, too, prove to be an 
overreaction?
While the value of growth cannot be doubted, the uncertainty in 
valuing rapidly growing companies is what kept Benjamin Graham 
away from IBM and other, more temporary highfliers. Thinking the 
same way, Warren Buffett has always had an aversion to speculative 
tech stocks and a fondness for boring companies that generate prof-
its reliably: Benjamin Moore, Burlington Northern, Dairy Queen, 
Fruit of the Loom, GEICO, See’s Candies, Coca-Cola, Kraft, Procter 
& Gamble. When Buffett bought Apple stock in 2016, this did not 
mean that he had changed his mind about growth stocks. Instead, it 
signaled that he now viewed Apple as a money machine, a mature 
company with dependable profits and an attractive stock price.
There is an old Wall Street saying, “A bargain that stays a bargain 
isn’t a bargain,” suggesting that buying a stock for a price less than 
its intrinsic value is not a good investment if the price doesn’t in-
crease afterward. Investors who focus on intrinsic value don’t think 
that way. Remember Warren Buffet’s aphorism, “My favorite ­holding

period is forever.” Intrinsic-value investors are not dismayed if the 
price doesn’t go up, because they buy stocks for income, not price 
appreciation. In fact, if the price goes down and the income projec-
tions haven’t changed, they will buy more. In market panics, value 
investors say, “Wall Street is having a sale.” They back up a truck and 
fill it with bargains.
ECONOMIC EVENTS AND THE STOCK MARKET
The two main economic drivers of the stock market are the state of 
the economy (boom or recession) and interest rates. When the 
economy is strong, profits surge and dividends follow close behind. 
When recession hits, profits slump and dividends grow slowly, or 
even drop. When interest rates go up or down, so do the required 
returns used to determine the intrinsic value of stocks. Higher re-
quired returns reduce intrinsic values; lower required returns in-
crease intrinsic values. This is why higher interest rates are bad news 
for the stock market and lower interest rates are good news.
It is often thought, wrongly, that the only reason interest rates af-
fect the stock market is because they affect the economy—making 
it more or less expensive for firms to borrow money to expand and 
for households to borrow money to buy things. For example, in 
March 1986, a seasoned market observer wrote: 
The force driving stock prices up is declining interest rates 
(and oil prices). Well, interest rates decline when lenders 
have lots of money but borrowers don’t have lots of need for 
it; that is, when business is slow. Like now. Every new statis-
tic—retail sales off a bit, unemployment up a bit—indicates 
that the economy is only so-so. Which wouldn’t be so bad if 
the outlook for the economy were better. But it’s not. De-
spite lower interest rates, business doesn’t seem in a hurry to 
invest in new plants and equipment. . . .

Intrinsic Value      73
What does it all mean? Only that the economy will 
­putter along—no disaster but no great glory either—and the 
stock market will probably take a sharp decline.
He was seemingly oblivious to the fact that, even if the economy 
just putters along, lower interest rates, all by themselves, make 
stocks more valuable because they increase the present value of fu-
ture dividends. As it turned out, the market did not take a sharp de-
cline. The S&P 500 rose 26 percent over the next twelve months.
The evidence is everywhere, but most obviously in big market 
moves. The 1973–1974 stock market crash ended when interest rates 
peaked, and the 1985–1986 stock market surge coincided with a 
3-percentage-point drop in long-term interest rates. The unemploy-
ment rate was near double-digit levels in 2009, 2010, and 2011, but 
there was a stock market boom fueled by the Fed reducing interest 
rates to keep the economy from collapsing.
ECONOMIC VALUE ADDED
If a company has strong earnings but doesn’t pay dividends, it is 
clearly worth something, but the present value of the nonexistent 
dividends is zero. We might assume that the company will eventu-
ally pay dividends, like Microsoft, Apple, and countless other com-
panies that never paid dividends—until they did. Value investors 
might predict a future date when the company will start paying div-
idends and predict how big the dividend will be and how rapidly it 
will increase. Then they could calculate the present value of these 
distant dividends. Not an easy task! And what about companies like 
Berkshire Hathaway that generate enormous profits but may never 
pay a dividend, reasoning that they can help their shareholders more 
by using the money to continue making profitable investments?
I will discuss two value-investor alternatives in Chapter 7, based 
on models created by Robert Shiller and John C. Bogle. Another 

74      MONEY MACHINE
­appealing approach is called economic value added (EVA). Suppose 
that a firm has $100 million in assets and earns $15 million, a 15 per-
cent return on its assets. So far, so good. Some profits are better 
than no profits. However, economic value added depends on whether 
earnings are higher than shareholders’ required earnings. If share-
holders require a 10 percent return, required earnings are $10 mil-
lion and the firm’s $15 million in actual earnings provides an economic 
value added of $5 million. If, on the other hand, the shareholders’ 
required return is 20 percent, there is a $5 million shortfall. Instead 
of adding value, the firm is subtracting value.
Economic value added makes a lot of sense because it asks and 
answers the right questions—and it makes no assumptions about 
Mr. Market’s prices. The clincher is that, for firms that do pay divi-
dends, economic value added gives the same intrinsic value as the 
dividend-discount model! The advantage of the EVA model is that it 
can be used for firms that do not pay dividends.
In the spring of 2000, Yahoo stock was one of the things I con-
sidered when assessing whether we were in a bubble. At that 36K 
conference, I noted that Yahoo’s stock price was $475 a share at the 
start of the year. Unlike most dot-coms, Yahoo was profitable, earn-
ing $55.8 million. Still, this was only 20 cents a share. Yahoo’s price-
earnings ratio (P/E) was a mind-boggling 2,375.
Yahoo didn’t pay a dividend and there were no dividends in the 
foreseeable future, so the dividend-discount model couldn’t be used 
to value its stock.
Could Yahoo’s price be justified by plausible assumptions? Here’s 
where economic value added comes in handy. With $1.24 billion in 
assets, a 10 percent shareholder required return implies required 
profits of $124 million. Yahoo’s actual $55.8 million profit in 1999 
was $68.2 million less than required. Instead of economic value 
added, Yahoo had economic value subtracted of $68.2 million. To jus-
tify its $125 billion market value, Yahoo would have needed an an-
nual EVA of $1.3 billion in 2000, $2.6 billion in 2001, $3.9 billion in 
2002, and so on forever.

Intrinsic Value      75
This is an interesting number because Walmart’s 1999 economic 
value added was $1.3 billion. So, to be worth its market value, Yahoo 
would have to be as profitable as Walmart in 2000, twice as profit-
able in 2001, three times as profitable in 2002, and so on.
It is hard to escape the conclusion that Yahoo was deliriously 
overvalued. The market soon came to its collective senses and Yahoo 
stock fell off the proverbial cliff (see Figure 6-3). Yahoo’s stock plum-
meted 90 percent over the twelve months following the 36K confer-
ence in the spring of 2000.
In the spring of 2000, value investors could not predict what Ya-
hoo’s stock price would be in the next few months or years, but they 
were confident that Yahoo’s bubbly stock price made it an extremely 
unattractive value investment.

Gold carries the unique distinction of always maintaining its 
intrinsic value, which means gold has never been worth zero. 
Don’t rely on stocks, bonds, and other paper-based invest-
ments valued according to others’ opinions.
Precious metals protect your investment and ensure that you 
are not putting your future in the hands of a volatile stock 
market. 
Nothing brings peace of mind like knowing your retirement 
assets are precious metals stored in a fortified bank vault.
The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 allows people to invest their IRAs 
in precious metals. Many precious-metal companies try to persuade 
people to do so. These arguments, taken from their advertisements, 
are unpersuasive. “Never worth zero” is hardly an assurance that the 
value won’t drop precipitously. Yes, stock prices depend on the opin-
ions of others, but so do precious-metal prices. Yes, stock prices are 
uncertain, but so are precious-metal prices.
Figure 6-4 shows the daily price of gold back to the 1970s, when 
governments abandoned the fixed exchange rate of $35/ounce. The 
price hit a high of $843 in January 1980, then fell over the next 
twenty years to $252 in June 1999. Then the price surged upward to 
a peak of $1,896.50 in September 2011, before falling 45 percent to 
$1,050.60 in December 2015.
And yet, after all these booms and busts, newspaper, magazine, 
radio, television, and internet ads continue to tout gold as a safe in-
vestment. Perhaps the most dangerous part of this nonsense is that 
IRAs are intended to maintain the living standards of retired peo-
ple. It sounds cruel, but the main financial risk during retirement is 
outliving one’s wealth and having to live in poverty. It is little com-
fort to retirees to know that their IRAs will never go all the way to 
zero.

The most salient fact about gold is that it has no intrinsic value, 
because it generates no cash whatsoever. In fact, it has a negative in-
trinsic value to the extent that investors must pay storage and secu-
rity fees to safeguard it. In a 1998 speech at Harvard, Warren Buffett 
said that gold “gets dug out of the ground in Africa or someplace. 
Then we melt it down, dig another hole, bury it again, and pay peo-
ple to stand around guarding it. It has no utility. Anyone watching 
from Mars would be scratching their head.” In his 2011 letter to 
Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, Buffett estimated that if we were 
to collect the world’s gold stock and melt it into a giant 170,000-ton 
cube, it would be about sixty-eight feet on a side and fit inside a 
baseball field easily. At the 2011 price of $1,127 per ounce, it would be 
worth about $9.6 trillion.
For that $9.6 trillion, we could instead buy all U.S. cropland, 
which generates $200 billion in revenue each year, plus sixteen com-
panies the size of ExxonMobil, each earning $40 billion, and still 
have $1 trillion left over to buy other revenue-generating assets. Buf-

A century from now the 400 million acres of farmland will 
have produced staggering amounts of corn, wheat, cotton,

bounty, whatever the currency may be. Exxon Mobil will 
probably have delivered trillions of dollars in dividends to its 
owners and will also hold assets worth many more trillions 
(and, remember, you get 16 Exxons). The 170,000 tons of 
gold will be unchanged in size and still incapable of produc-
ing anything. You can fondle the cube, but it will not

Value investors do not buy metals—no matter how precious—­
because metals do not generate cash; they are not money machines.

INVESTMENT BENCHMARKS
My favorite definition of a growth stock is  
“a stock that somebody is trying to sell you.”
—Burton Crane
A 
stock’s intrinsic value equals the present value of its divi-
dends, but value investors look beyond dividends to a firm’s 
earnings and assets. Earnings are important because these give firms 
the means to pay dividends, and assets are important because these 
are the source of earnings. Dividend-price ratios, earnings-price ra-
tios, and asset-price ratios are sensible financial benchmarks, but 
none are infallible.
THE EARNINGS-PRICE RATIO
A stock’s earnings-price ratio (E/P), or earnings yield, is a rough es-
timate of a stock’s rate of return. If a stock sells for $100 a share and 
the company earns $10 a share, it seems as though the shareholders 
have earned $10, which is a 10 percent return on their investment. If 
so, earnings yields should be related closely to the interest rates on 
Treasury bonds.
Figure 7-1 shows the S&P 500 earnings yield and the interest rate 
on long-term Treasury bonds back to 1871. There does not appear to 
be a consistent relationship. One thing that does stand out is how 

80      MONEY MACHINE
volatile earnings yields have been compared to interest rates, a re-
flection of the collective euphoria and hysteria that periodically 
seizes the stock market. Mr. Market is fickle.
FIGURE 7-1. The S&P 500 earnings yield (E/P) and long-term Treasury rate (R), 	
	
1871–2015
The earnings yield was well above the Treasury rate up until the 
1960s. Figure 7-2 zooms in on the years since 1960. Over the last 
fifty years, these two series have been more closely aligned, but they 
hardly move in unison. Sometimes they even move in opposite di-
rections. After 2010, the Treasury rate dropped while the earnings 
yield rose, creating a substantial gap between the two.
The problem with interpreting the earnings yield as the share­
holders’ return is that stockholders receive dividends, not earnings. 
Getting a $10 dividend is a lot different from reading about $10 in 
earnings in the annual report.
If a company pays a $5 dividend out of its $10 earnings, stock-
holders should consider the fate of the remaining $5. If these re-
tained earnings are squandered, the $5 might as well not have been 
earned in the first place. For a dollar of retained earnings to be worth

a dollar to shareholders, the firm must earn a return equal to the 
shareholders’ required return. If the firm earns less than the re-
quired return, a dollar of retained earnings is worth less than a dol-
lar. If the firm earns more than the required return, a dollar of 
retained earnings is worth more than a dollar. This is why Berkshire 
Hathaway doesn’t pay dividends. Its managers believe that their in-
vestments will earn more than their shareholders’ required return.
The more general point is that the earnings-price ratio is an im-
perfect measure of the stockholders’ return. Earnings are important 
because they are the source of dividends. However, earnings are the 
means to the end, not the end itself.
THE DIVIDEND-PRICE RATIO
Some investors use the dividend yield, the ratio of dividends per 
share to price (D/P), as a measure of the shareholders’ return. In our 
example, investors see the stock’s $5 dividend and $100 price, and 
they estimate the stock’s return to be 5 percent. However, this 

82      MONEY MACHINE
­calculation only makes sense if the dividend stays at $5 indefinitely. 
A $5 dividend, year after year, on a $100 investment is, indeed, a 5 
percent return. However, most firms grow with the economy and 
their earnings and dividends grow, too.
Figure 7-3 shows the history of the S&P 500 dividend yield and 
the interest rate on long-term Treasury bonds. As with the earnings 
yield, there is no consistent relationship. It is very interesting, 
though, that the dividend yield was always above the bond rate be-
fore 1958 and persistently below afterward, until they converged in 
2009.
In 1950, for example, stocks had a dividend yield of nearly 9 per-
cent when long-term Treasury rates were only 2 percent. Investors 
either woefully underestimated the likelihood that dividends would 
grow over time, providing a double-digit return from stocks, or they 
were so afraid of stocks that they required double-digit returns to 
persuade them to leave the safety of 2 percent Treasuries. The for-
mer explanation is more plausible. What a great time to be a value 
investor!

A BETTER ALTERNATIVE
The earnings yield looks at profits rather than dividends. The divi-
dend yield ignores the future growth of dividends. A better rule of 
thumb is to use the insight provided by the JBW equation that was 
introduced in Chapter 6: The total return equals the dividend yield 
plus the growth rate of dividends:
R
D
P
g
=
+
We can apply this equation to the overall market by calculating 
the current dividend yield for the S&P 500 and making an assump-
tion about the long-run growth of dividends, which is perhaps equal 
to the long-run growth of the economy. This total return estimate—
the dividend yield plus the dividend growth rate—can be compared 
to the interest rate on long-term Treasury bonds plus whatever risk 
premium seems appropriate. In 1950, for example, a 9 percent divi-
dend yield plus a 5 percent growth rate implies a 14 percent total re-
turn, R = 0.09 + 0.05 = 0.14, far above the 2 percent interest rate on 
long-term Treasury bonds. Value investors were, no doubt, ecstatic 
about an anticipated 14 percent annual return.
The comparison was much closer in 2013, when the dividend 
yield and long-term Treasury rate were both around 2 percent. Now, 
a 5 percent projected growth rate gives stocks a 5 percent margin 
over Treasuries (7 percent versus 2 percent), which might not be 
enough for value investors requiring more than a 5 percent risk pre-
mium. I was satisfied with a 5 percent premium and wrote a blog 
saying so.
THE PRICE-EARNINGS RATIO
A stock’s price-earnings ratio is obtained by dividing the price per 
share by the annual earnings per share. The price-earnings ratio, 

84      MONEY MACHINE
P/E, is the inverse of the earnings yield, E/P, and its mechanical 
usage to gauge whether stocks are cheap or expensive is subject to 
the same cautions.
Many investors have long considered a P/E ratio of 10 as normal 
and the purchase of a stock with a P/E ratio less than 10 a sound in-
vestment. For example, Burton Crane, a New York Times financial 
writer from 1937 to 1963, observed that “most of us over the age of 
forty, unless we are completely without market knowledge, subcon-
sciously think of [dividend] yields of 6 per cent and price-earnings 
ratios of 10 as about right.”
Figure 7-4 shows that the price-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 
has varied considerably, falling to a low of close to 5 in some years 
and topping 20 in others. The average value has been a P/E ratio of 
14.9. The P/E spikes in 2001 and 2008 were due to economic reces-
sions that caused earnings to fall by more than 50 percent. Stock 
prices fell, too, but not as far as earnings because investors believed 
that the recession would not last long. With earnings down a lot and 
prices down a little, the P/E went up.

A LOW P/E IS NOT NECESSARILY A BARGAIN
Crane correctly cautioned that “no market is cheap because the 
price-earnings ratio is low and no market is dear because the ratio is 
high.” Mechanical rules ignore perfectly logical reasons why individ-
ual stocks or the market as a whole may be cheap even if the P/E 
ratio is high and expensive even though the P/E is low.
The intrinsic value of a stock is higher if earnings (and dividends) 
are expected to grow faster. Intrinsic values are also higher if inter-
est rates are low. Thus, the market P/E tends to be high when inves-
tors are bullish on the economy and/or interest rates are low.
The same is true of individual stocks. Figure 7-5 shows P/E ratios 
and five-year earnings growth predicted by professional security an-
alysts for the Dow Jones Industrial stocks. Investors were willing to 
pay more for faster-growing companies.

stock’s price may stay relatively firm as current earnings sag, driving 
the P/E ratio skyward. In these circumstances, the P/E ratio is un-
usually high because earnings are abnormally low. In the reverse sit-
uation, the P/E will fall if investors perceive a temporary bulge in 
earnings to be due to extraordinary good luck. Similarly, if investors 
believe that the firm has used dubious accounting procedures to 
boost reported earnings, the P/E ratio will be deceptively small be-
cause earnings are fictitiously large.
The bottom line is that there is no reason to think that the mar-
ket’s P/E should be some magic number like 10 or 14.9. There is even 
less reason to think this should be true of individual stocks.
USING P/ES FOR INVESTMENT DECISIONS
Although it is unwise to base investment decisions on P/E rules 
carved in stone—for example, buy when the P/E is below 7, sell 
when it is above 15—price-earnings ratios can still be used to help 
value investors make informed investment decisions. We will look at 
a model developed by John C. Bogle, the founder and former chair-
man of Vanguard. Although his procedure can be used for individual 
securities and for short horizons, Bogle cautions that there are “two 
lessons that I have learned in more than a few decades in the invest-
ment field. First, the performance of individual securities is unpre-
dictable, period. Second, the performance of portfolios of securities 
is unpredictable on any short-term basis.”
Thus he recommends using his approach for portfolios (such as 
the S&P 500) over ten-year horizons. Bogle assumes that intrinsic 
value is equal to the present value of the cash generated, and that 
dividends and earnings grow at the same rate. For an investor with a 
ten-year horizon, this cash consists of the dividends over the next 
ten years and stock prices ten years from now.
Bogle’s clever insight is that stock prices ten years from now de-
pend on two factors: the growth in earnings and the change in the 

Investment Benchmarks      87
P/E ratio that the market uses to value these earnings. If earnings 
double, the stock price will double. If the P/E ratio doubles, the 
stock price will double. If earnings and the P/E both double, the 
stock price will quadruple.
This insight also helps us understand why growth stocks are dou-
bly vulnerable. A stock’s price is, by definition, its earnings per share 
multiplied by its price-earnings ratio. If earnings turn out to be 
lower than expected, this will reduce the stock price. If the P/E falls 
because of the disappointing earnings, this will reduce the stock’s 
price. That’s a double blow to the growth stock’s price.
To implement Bogle’s model, we need to predict the growth 
rate of earnings and the change, if any, in the price-earnings ratio. 
We can then estimate the implied rate of return using this simple 
­approximation:
stock
return = dividend
yield
+ annual growth
of earnings
+ annual change
in P/E
Bogle gives this example for the S&P 500 in the 1980s. At the 
start of the decade, the dividend yield was 5.2 percent and the P/E 
was 7.3. Earnings grew at a 4.4 percent rate during this decade and 
the P/E at the end of the decade was 15.5, an annual growth rate of 
7.8 percent. Thus the annual rate of return on the S&P 500 during 
the 1980s was approximately 17.4 percent:
Table 7-1 shows the components of the annual returns for each 
decade from 1900 through 2010. Stocks did great in the 1950s, 
1980s, and 1990s because of extraordinary increases in the P/E ratio. 
The below-average stock returns in the 1960s, 1970s, and 2000s, in 
contrast, reflected a falling price-earnings ratio. Overall, the average

change in the P/E has been essentially zero. In the long run, half of 
the return from stocks has been from dividends and half from earn-
ings growth—nothing from changes in the P/E.

SEEING THE DOT-COM BUBBLE
In March 2000, the S&P 500 was four times higher than a decade 
earlier, a 16 percent annual rate of increase. Add in dividends and in-
vestors had made close to 20 percent a year. Easy money! A survey 
asked investors what annual rate of return they expected over the 
next ten years. The median answer was 15 percent.
One reason I was convinced that the dot-com boom was a dot-
com bubble was an application of Bogle’s model. In the spring of 
2000, the S&P 500 had a dividend yield of 1.3 percent and a P/E of 
30. Interest rates were 6.4 percent on ten-year Treasury bonds.
Because the future is uncertain, it is a good idea to consider a va-

Investment Benchmarks      89
riety of scenarios. In my investments class, I used Bogle’s model to 
estimate stock returns over the next ten years for the four scenarios 
in Table 7-2.

The historical baseline assumed that dividends and earnings would 
grow by 5 percent a year, as they had over the previous decade, and 
that the price-earnings ratio would return to its historical average of 
15. If so, the shareholders’ annual return would be negative (–1 per-
cent). More pessimistic scenarios implied worse.
The unemployment rate had fallen from 5.6 percent in 1990 to 
4.0 percent in March 2000, and it seemed unlikely that the econ-
omy would grow faster than it had during the previous decade. An 
optimistic scenario of 6 percent growth and the P/E rising to 35 
would give a 9 percent shareholder return, not much more than the 
6.4 percent interest rate on Treasury bonds and a whole lot less than 
the 15 percent that investors anticipated.
To get that 15 percent return, investors needed to make seem-
ingly delirious assumptions, such as the earnings growth rate rising 
to 7 percent and the P/E doubling to 60. What would happen when 
this preposterous future did not materialize and investors learned 
that stocks were not easy riches? I told my students to expect inves-
tors to head for the exits, and most to get trampled.

SEEING THROUGH THE DOOM-AND-GLOOM
The stock market did crash and euphoria turned into hysteria. In 
December 2008, I was interviewed on a local television show. The 
S&P 500 was down 40 percent from March 2000 and dot-com 
stocks were down more—much more. The unemployment rate was 
7.8 percent and rising as the economy hurtled into the Great Reces-
sion. Who would be crazy enough to buy stocks? I raised my hand.
Here are some excerpts from my interview:
We’re in an economy that’s sick. Everyone is depressed. Ev-
eryone is gloomy. Everyone is worried about the future. And 
yet you gotta think about the prices, how far stock prices 
have fallen. So, today, you have dividend yields that are close 
to 4 percent, Treasury bonds are paying 3 percent. Remem-
ber back in 2000, Treasury bonds were paying 5 percent 
more than dividend yields. Now it’s the other way around. 
Dividend yields are above Treasury bonds. You have price-
earnings ratios that are down to 13 or 14.
It reminds me a lot of the 1973–74 crash, which you and I 
both lived through, and it was just a fearful, fearful time, but 
1974 in retrospect was a great time to buy stocks. And then 
you had the 2000 internet bubble and the crash, 2001–2002, 
and people were getting out of the market and said they 
would never go back. In retrospect, 2002 was a great time to 
buy stocks. . . .
I would say that the worst possible thing to do now if you 
are in the market is to say I’ve gotta sell everything, I can’t 
afford to lose any more money. What you’re doing is you’re 
just locking in your losses. 
You and I—we don’t know what stock prices are going to 
be tomorrow, or next week, or next month, but . . . we can 
say with great confidence . . . this economy will be much big-
ger, much stronger ten years from now than it is today, and 

Investment Benchmarks      91
stock prices will be much higher. And, so, this is a time to be 
buying, not a time to be panicking. . . .
I’m really excited. I was so gloomy in 2000 and I was so 
pumped up in 1974 and I was so pumped up in 2002, and I’m 
pumped up again. I feel like this is a buying opportunity that 
only comes around a half dozen times in a lifetime.
We’re not yet ten years into December 2008’s future, but the mar-
ket did recover nicely, with the S&P 500 doubling over the next five 
years.
SHILLER’S CYCLICALLY ADJUSTED EARNINGS
Nobel laureate Robert Shiller has a sensible way of dealing with 
short-term fluctuations in earnings. First, he calculates real, infla-
tion-adjusted earnings for the S&P 500. Then he calculates the aver-
age value of these inflation-adjusted earnings over the preceding ten 
years. Figure 7-6 shows that this ten-year average—which he calls 
cyclically adjusted earnings—smooths out earnings fluctuations 
caused by temporary booms and recessions.

Shiller calculates a cyclically adjusted P/E ratio (CAPE) by divid-
ing the inflation-adjusted value of the S&P 500 by cyclically adjusted 
earnings. Figure 7-7 shows the actual and cyclically adjusted P/Es for 
the S&P 500.
 FIGURE 7-7. Actual and cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio
This reasonable procedure has the virtue of averaging out booms 
and busts. However, the cyclically adjusted P/E still has some of the 
same issues as unadjusted P/Es in gauging whether stocks are cheap 
or expensive. One is that growth matters. The cyclically adjusted 
P/E may be unusually high, but still perfectly reasonable, if earnings 
over the next ten years are expected to be much higher than earn-
ings over the previous ten years.
Also, interest rates matter. When interest rates are low, P/E 
should be high, too. Shiller uses a graph, like the one in Figure 7-8, 
to demonstrate the inverse relationship between the cyclically ad-
justed P/E and the interest rate on ten-year Treasury bonds. As in-
terest rates came down from their double-digit levels in the early 
1980s, the price-earnings ratio went up.

Although the price-earnings ratio P/E is more familiar than the 
earnings yield E/P, the positive relationship between interest rates 
and the earnings yield is easier to see than is the negative relation-
ship between interest rates and the price-earnings ratio. Figure 7-9 
shows that the cyclically adjusted earnings yield (CAEP) and ten-
year Treasury rate have tended to move up and down together.

DID THE STOCK MARKET MAKE A MISTAKE?
The interest rates in Figures 7-8 and 7-9 are not adjusted for infla-
tion. Suppose a one percent increase in the rate of inflation were to 
increase interest rates and stock dividends, earnings, and prices by 
one percent. Dollar interest rates would be one percent higher, but 
inflation-adjusted interest rates and the earnings-price ratio would 
be constant. These assumptions are surely too simple. Nonetheless, 
it is reasonable that the earnings yield is more closely related to in-
flation-adjusted interest rates than to dollar interest rates.
In the spring of 1979, Franco Modigliani and Richard Cohn made 
the provocative argument that investors in the 1970s mistakenly be-
lieved earnings yields should go up and down with dollar interest 
rates rather than inflation-adjusted interest rates.
A telling example is Benjamin Graham, who recommended a 
maximum P/E ratio of 15 in the early 1960s, when interest rates on 
long-term, high-grade corporate bonds were around 4.5 percent, but 
halved his maximum P/E to 8 in 1974, with corporate bond rates 
above 9 percent.
Modigliani and Cohn argued that because of this market-wide 
mistake, stock prices were about half what they should have been, 
which made earnings yields twice what they should have been.
To investigate this argument, I calculated the real inflation-­
adjusted interest rate each year by using the change in the consumer 
price index over the next year. For example, I adjusted the dollar in-
terest rate in January 2000 by using the change in the consumer 
price index between January 2000 and January 2001. This is an im-
perfect measure of investors’ inflation expectations, but maybe it is 
not systematically biased.
Figure 7-10 compares these real interest rates with Shiller’s cycli-
cally adjusted earnings yield. What immediately leaps out of this fig-
ure is how close they were between 1981 and 2009, and how far apart 
they were in the 1970s. A comparison of Figures 7-9 and 7-10 con-
firms the Modigliani-Cohn argument. In the 1970s, investors evi-

Investment Benchmarks      95
dently compared earnings yields with dollar interest rates rather 
than real interest rates. If this was a mistake, stock prices were much 
too low in the 1970s.

Although Modigliani and Cohn cautioned that mispriced stocks 
need not be correctly priced anytime soon, 1979 would have been a 
very good time to buy stock, as the return from doing so would have 
been 32 percent in 1980 and 18 percent compounded annually for 
the entire 1980s.
Part of the reason for the booming market was the drop in in-
terest rates in the 1980s, but part of the reason was that investors 
made a colossal mistake in the 1970s. This is one of those occa-
sions, like speculative bubbles and panics, where the presumption 
that markets know best is battered and bruised. It wasn’t a slight 
mispricing. It was a blunder that left truckloads of $100 bills on 
the sidewalk.

THE GROWTH TRAP
Decades ago, many investors gauged a stock’s attractiveness by its 
dividend yield. Indeed, as Figure 7-3 shows, up until 1958 the average 
dividend yield almost always exceeded the interest rate on Treasury 
bonds, indicating that investors attached little importance to divi-
dend growth. As late as 1950, the average dividend yield was nearly 
9 percent while the yield on Treasury bonds was only 2 percent. The 
JBW equation teaches us that growth, too, is important. If a stock 
has a 9 percent dividend yield and the dividend will grow by 5 per-
cent a year, the annual rate of return is 14 percent, not 9 percent.
As the value of growth was increasingly recognized in the 1950s 
and 1960s, rising stock prices pushed dividend yields below bond 
yields. By the early 1970s, investors seemed to be interested only in 
growth, especially the premier growth stocks labeled the Nifty 50. 
This myopia led them to pay what, in retrospect, were ridiculous 
prices for growth stocks.
THE NIFTY 50
In the early 1970s, the attention of institutional investors was fo-
cused on a small group of “one decision” stocks that were so appeal-
ing that they should always be bought and never sold, no matter 
what the price. Value investors know that it is always a bad idea to 
buy or sell stocks without considering the price, and this time was 
no exception.
Among these select few were IBM, Xerox, Disney, McDonald’s, 
Avon, Polaroid, and Schlumberger. In each case, earnings had 
grown by at least 10 percent a year over the past five to ten years, 
and no reason for a slowdown was in sight. Each company was a 
leader in its field, with a strong balance sheet and profit rates close 
to 20 percent.

Investment Benchmarks      97
David Dreman recounted the dreams of missed opportunities 
that danced in investors’ heads:
Had someone put $10,000 in Haloid Xerox in 1960, the year 
the first plain copier, the 914, was introduced, the invest-
ment would have been worth $16.5 million a decade later. 
McDonald’s earnings increased several thousand times in 
the 1961–66 period, and then, more demurely, quadrupled 
again by 1971, the year of its eight billionth hamburger. Any-
one astute enough to buy McDonald’s stock in 1965, when it 
went public, would have made fortyfold his money in the 
next seven years. An investor who plunked $2,750 into 
Thomas J. Watson’s Computing and Tabulating Company in 
1914 would have had over $20 million in IBM stock by the 
beginning of the 1970s.
The unfortunate consequence of this fixation on the Nifty 50 was 
the belief that there is never a bad time to buy a growth stock, nor 
is there too high a price to pay. A money manager infatuated with 
growth stocks wrote, “The time to buy a growth stock is now. The 
whole purpose in such an investment is to participate in future 
larger earnings, so ipso facto any delay in making the commitment is 
defeating.” This is suspiciously similar to the Greater Fool Theory 
and contradicts the main tenet of value investing—that stocks, like 
groceries, should never be bought without regard for price. IBM is 
a fine company, but is its stock worth $1,000 a share? Any price, no 
matter how high?
The subsequent performance of many of the Nifty 50 was disap-
pointing; yet, even today, some money managers believe that you 
can’t go wrong with a good growth stock, no matter what price you 
pay. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services, was 
very blunt: “[Suppose] an investor’s timing was exquisitely wrong 
and he bought a growth stock at its peak. If he held that stock until 
the top of the next market cycle, such an investor would be better 
off with a growth stock than a value play.”

98      MONEY MACHINE
Not necessarily. Avon was a hot growth stock in 1973 when it sold 
for $140 a share, sixty times earnings. In 1974, the price collapsed to 
$19; twelve years later, in 1986, it was selling for $25 a share. Polaroid 
sold for $150 in 1972 (an astounding 115 times earnings), $14 in 1974, 
and $42 in 1986, before going bankrupt in 2001. Xerox hit $172 in 
1972 (sixty times earnings), $49 in 1974, $27 in 1982, and $49 in 1986. 
An investor with exquisitely wrong timing would have been better 
off putting money under the mattress, not to mention buying rea-
sonably priced stocks.
These were not isolated cases. Many glamour stocks that were 
pushed to extraordinary P/E ratios in the 1970s did substantially 
worse than the market over the next several decades.
There is some uncertainty about the exact composition of the 
Nifty 50, with one Forbes article referring to a Morgan Guaranty 
Trust list and several other Forbes articles referring to a Kidder Pea-
body list. If any group of stocks can be clearly counted among the 
stocks of the Nifty 50 legend, it is the twenty-four stocks that ap-
pear on both lists.
A student and I looked at the performance of these Terrific 24 
stocks over the twenty-nine-year period from December 1972 
through December 2001. Figure 7-11 shows that eighteen of them 
underperformed the S&P 500 and that those stocks with the high-
est P/Es were most likely to underperform. These stocks should be 
renamed the Terrible 24.
An investor who bought these twenty-four stocks at the end of 
1972 would have had 50 percent less wealth at the end of 2001 than 
an investor who bought the S&P 500.
There are two reasons why growth stocks are sometimes disap-
pointing. First, investors appraising a stock with their hearts instead 
of their minds see temporary growth and think they have found per-
manent growth. Second, some growth is worthless and some firms 
create an appearance of growth to boost the price of their stock. We 
will look at each of these pitfalls in turn.

THE DANGERS OF INCAUTIOUS 
EXTRAPOLATION
Benjamin Graham was wary of growth stocks because growth pro-
jections are so often based on little more than simple-minded ex-
trapolations: “It must be remembered that the automatic or normal 
economic forces militate against the indefinite continuance of a 
given trend. Competition, regulation, the law of diminishing re-
turns, etc. are powerful foes to unlimited expansion.”
The value of a growth stock lies in the distant future, and it is 
risky to extrapolate a few years of impressive growth into several de-
cades of stunning growth. Many ludicrous examples have been con-
cocted to dramatize the folly of incautious extrapolation. A study of 
British public speakers over the past 350 years found that the aver-
age sentence length had fallen from seventy-two words per sentence 
for Francis Bacon to twenty-four for Winston Churchill. If this 
trend continues (famous last words), the number of words per sen-
tence will soon hit zero and then go negative.

It is also an incautious extrapolation to assume that a firm’s ex-
traordinary profits will continue indefinitely.
WORTHLESS GROWTH
Growth per se is not valuable. A company that reduces current divi-
dends in order to grow bigger always increases the firm’s earning 
growth (as long as profits are positive) but doesn’t increase the in-
trinsic value of its stock unless the profit is larger than the share-
holders’ required return.
Here is a great example of how growth is not necessarily valuable. 
Consider a mutual fund that invests in Treasury bills—all Treasury 
bills all the time—paying 4 percent interest. If the fund pays all the 
interest to its shareholders, they earn a 4 percent return and the fund 
has a zero percent growth rate. Now suppose the fund switches to a 
growth philosophy by paying out half the interest to its shareholders 
and using the other half to buy more Treasury bills. The fund is grow-
ing now, but shareholders are no better off—because all the firm did 
is buy Treasury bills that investors could have purchased themselves.
CREATING AN ILLUSION OF GROWTH
Another trap for investors who focus myopically on earnings growth 
is that companies can manufacture growth by acquiring companies 
with low P/E ratios. For a simple example, consider the two firms in 
Table 7-3, each with $100 million in assets and one million shares 
outstanding. Smith earns a 10 percent profit on its assets and share-
holders require a 10 percent return on their stock. Hwang earns a 20 
percent return on its assets and shareholders require a 20 percent 
return. Both companies pay all of their earnings out as dividends. 
Both are no-growth companies and each has a total market value of 
$100 million, $100 a share.

Investment Benchmarks      101
Now assume that Smith merges with Hwang by issuing a million 
new shares of stock that are traded one-for-one to the Hwang share-
holders. The two companies continue to operate exactly as before, 
the only difference being that their balance sheets are combined. 
The results are in the last column in Table 7-3. Since there are no 
changes in their operations or in current and future earnings, the 
market value of the combined companies should be the sum of the 
market values of the two separate firms, $100 million + $100 million 
= $200 million, and the per-share price should stay at $100.

Yet, from the standpoint of Smith, earnings per share have 
jumped 50 percent, from $10 to $15. Conversely, from the stand-
point of Hwang, earnings per share have fallen 25 percent, from $20 
to $15. If the merged company is named Smith, investors might com-
pare last year’s $10 earnings with this year’s $15, decide Smith is now 
a growth company, and apply a higher price-earnings ratio, pushing 
the price above $150 a share. Then Smith will be even better posi-
tioned to manufacture more earnings growth by acquiring more 
low-P/E companies. If, on the other hand, the new company is 
named Hwang, investors may compare this year’s $15 earnings with 

102      MONEY MACHINE
last year’s $20 and flee a disaster in the making. Both conclusions are 
wrong. The lesson is simple: Value investors should look at the rea-
sons for earnings growth.
BOOK VALUE
The book value of a firm is the net worth shown on the accountants’ 
books. It is commonly calculated on a per-share basis, total assets 
minus liabilities, divided by the number of shares outstanding.
Book values are generally based on the cost of a firm’s assets, de-
preciated over time for presumed wear and tear. However, a firm’s 
value to shareholders is the cash that it generates, not the cost of its 
assets. A firm that loses money year after year is of little value to 
shareholders even if it costs billions to construct its money-losing 
buildings and equipment. (Imagine a tomato farm on top of Mount 
Everest.) Conversely, a high-technology company operating out of a 
garage can be worth millions of dollars even though its garage is only 
worth thousands.
TOBIN’S Q
James Tobin argued that we should look at how financial markets 
value a firm relative to the replacement cost of its assets:
q
market value of firm
replacement cost of firm's assets
=
Tobin’s q is larger or smaller than 1 depending on whether the 
firm’s profits are larger or smaller than the shareholders’ required re-
turn on their stock. If this sounds like economic value added, you’re 
right.

Investment Benchmarks      103
If a firm’s profits are persistently larger than shareholders’ re-
quired return, economic value added is positive and Tobin’s q is 
larger than 1. If profits are less than shareholders’ required return, 
economic value added is negative and Tobin’s q is less than 1.
Tobin argues that a firm should invest in new buildings and equip-
ment if the stock market will value the investment at more than its 
cost (that is, if its q ratio is greater than 1). Put more plainly, the ap-
propriate question a firm should ask is whether, if the firm were to 
sell shares in its expansion, it could raise enough money to cover the 
cost.
The persuasive logic can be illustrated by a home builder’s calcu-
lation. It only makes sense to build homes if the potential market 
value exceeds the construction cost. The same reasoning applies to 
all corporate investment. A firm should compare the cost of its in-
vestments with the value that financial markets will place on these 
investments. If the market value is larger than the cost (q greater 
than 1), shareholders want the firm to make this investment, gladly 
giving up a dollar of dividends in exchange for a two-dollar increase 
in the value of their stock.
If a firm’s market value is less than the replacement cost of its 
assets (q less than 1), the firm is worth more dead than alive, and it 
should sell its assets and distribute the proceeds as dividends. 
Shareholders prefer two dollars of dividends to one dollar of mar-
ket value.
WHAT DETERMINES Q?
How can assets be valued in financial markets at other than their re-
placement cost? Assets are of value to shareholders only to the ex-
tent they generate profits. It matters not at all that a factory cost $1 
billion to build if it doesn’t make a dime of profits. For a factory to 
be worth what it costs shareholders, it must earn the shareholders’ 
required return.

104      MONEY MACHINE
Consider a restaurant that would cost $1 million to build and 
earn a constant 20 percent annual profit, $200,000, forever. All 
earnings are paid out as dividends. How much will investors pay for 
a $200,000 annual dividend? If Treasury bonds pay 5 percent, per-
haps stock in a risky restaurant is priced to yield 10 percent. Using 
the JBW equation in Chapter 6 with no growth, the restaurant’s 
value is $2 million:
V
$200,000
0.10
$2,000,000
=
=
Valued at $2 million, the $200,000 annual dividend gives inves-
tors their 10 percent required return. The market value of the res-
taurant is twice its cost of construction (q = 2) and the restaurant is 
worth building because its 20 percent profit is larger than the inves-
tors’ 10 percent required return.
If, on the other hand, the investors’ required return is 25 percent, 
then the market value is only $800,000:
V
$200,000
0.25

Now q = 0.8 and the restaurant is not worth building. Investors 
require a 25 percent return on their stock, but the restaurant earns 
only 20 percent on its cost. The stock must be valued at less than 
cost to give investors their requisite return.
USING Q TO PREDICT THE MARKET
A New York Times article titled “A New Way to Measure an Exhausted 
Bull” began: “Is the q ratio signaling that the end is near for this 
great bull market? The what? If you’re an economist, you didn’t even 

Investment Benchmarks      105
ask the second question.” The article went on to point out that q 
was 1.7 at that time and quoted a British consulting firm: “Professor 
Tobin received a Nobel prize for his work, and the U.S. stock market 
may thus be said to be making a bet of approximately $3 trillion that 
he should return his laurels. I expect him to be justified in keeping 
them.”
This bearish consultant evidently believed that market values 
were too high because they were 1.7 times replacement cost, rather 
than equal to replacement cost. The $3 trillion figure was the differ-
ence between market value and replacement cost.
However, Tobin’s q need not equal 1. The value of q could be 1.7, 
or even higher, if profit rates are higher than shareholder required 
returns. In our restaurant example, there is a compelling reason why 
q equals 2 and no reason why it should equal 1.
It turned out that the bull market was not exhausted. After the 
New York Times article appeared, the S&P went up 26 percent over 
the next twelve months and doubled over the next three years. 
­Tobin’s q helps us understand why the stock market goes up or 
down, but it is not necessarily a tool for picking $100 bills up off the 
­sidewalk.
VALUE STOCKS
There is considerable evidence of abnormal returns from “value” 
stocks that have low prices relative to dividends, earnings, and book 
value. Mechanical rules are no guarantee of success, but these valua-
tion metrics have the virtue of cultivating a contrarian approach to 
investing. Value investing and contrarian investing are often two 
sides of the same coin. When investors are fearful and contrarian in-
vestors look to pounce, stock prices are low relative to dividends, 
earnings, and book value, and these bargain prices attract value in-
vestors. Greed, on the other hand, which is a sell sign for contrarian 
investors, fuels high stock prices that scare off value investors.

106      MONEY MACHINE
Eugene Fama and others who believe that the market never 
makes a mistake argue that the abnormal returns from value strate-
gies must be risk premiums. Therefore, value strategies must be 
risky—even if the only evidence we have of their riskiness is that 
they are profitable. Skeptics dismiss this reasoning as circular and 
argue that animal spirits and other market noise create profitable 
opportunities for contrarians and value investors.
THE DOGS OF THE DOW
Michael B. O’Higgins was an early and enthusiastic advocate of a 
strategy with the memorable name: the Dogs of the Dow. At the be-
ginning of each year, calculate the dividend yield (dividend divided 
by price) for each of the thirty stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average and invest in the ten stocks with the highest dividend yields. 
These stocks are evidently out of favor, in that their prices are low 
relative to dividends—hence the label Dogs of the Dow. Writing in 
1991, O’Higgins reported that the Dogs had outperformed the mar-
ket for decades.
One explanation is the contrarian idea that investors overreact 
to bad news and their overreaction causes stock prices to fall too far, 
so that out-of-favor stocks are bargains. Another explanation is that 
a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush; that is, it is better to 
have a dividend in your pocket than dreams of capital gains at the 
end of a rainbow. Or perhaps it is just a coincidence uncovered by 
ransacking the data.
If it is just data mining, then it should do poorly with fresh data. 
In the twenty years after the Dogs of the Dow theory was first re-
ported, the strategy had an annual return of 10.8 percent, the same 
as the Dow as a whole, but better than the S&P 500’s 9.6 percent. 
Solid, but not spectacular. Perhaps the Dogs of the Dow are not as 
far out of favor as are dogs not in the Dow.

LOW PRICE-EARNINGS RATIOS
Several studies have found that stocks with low P/Es outperform 
stocks with high P/Es. For instance, Benjamin Graham divided the 
Dow Jones Industrials into the ten highest, ten middle, and ten low-
est P/E ratios. For every five-year holding period between 1937 and 
1969, the low P/E stocks outperformed the middle P/E stocks, 
which outperformed the high P/E stocks. If $10,000 had been in-
vested and reinvested every five years in the ten stocks with the low-
est P/E ratios at that time, it would have grown to more than 
$100,000 by 1969, more than twice the amount accumulated by in-
vesting and reinvesting in the ten highest P/E stocks.
LOW PRICE-BOOK RATIOS
Another plausible identifier of out-of-favor stocks is the ratio of the 
stock price to book value. One study calculated the ratio of market 
value to book value for the S&P 500 on January 1 of each of the 
forty-five years from 1950–1994. The years were then divided into 
two categories, depending on the beginning-of-year ratio of market 
value to book value: 1) the twenty-two years with the highest ratios 
and 2) the twenty-two years with the lowest ratios. (The median year 
was discarded.) The years with low beginning-of-year price-book ra-
tios had an average return of 20 percent, the years with high price-
book ratios 6 percent.
Similar results have been found for individual stocks. Even Fama, 
perhaps the most enthusiastic proponent of the efficient market hy-
pothesis, has admitted that stocks with low price-book ratios beat 
the market. His explanation is unconvincing. He argues that be-
cause markets are efficient (might as well assume what you are try-
ing to prove), low price-book stocks must have risks that we do not 
understand but investors fear.

108      MONEY MACHINE
A more persuasive explanation is that Mr. Market’s prices fluctu-
ate more than intrinsic values. When Mr. Market’s prices are high 
relative to benchmarks like dividends, earnings, and book value, his 
prices are probably too high. When Mr. Market’s prices are low rela-
tive to these benchmarks, they are probably too low.
SMALL CAPITALIZATION STOCKS
It is not profitable for large institutions to do expensive research on 
small companies because any attempt to buy a substantial number 
of shares will drive the price upward and a later sale will force the 
price down. If small stocks are neglected, they might also be cheap.
Several studies have found that firms with a small total market 
value, called small capitalization or small-cap firms, have signifi-
cantly outperformed larger companies. One study considered the 
performance of ten portfolios revised annually by dividing 2,000 
stocks into ten groups based on their total market value at the time. 
The subsequent annual rates of return, neglecting transaction costs, 
are in Table 7-4 and show that small-cap portfolios consistently out-
performed large-cap portfolios.

Fama has acknowledged that small-cap stocks have outperformed 
large caps. And he has again reached for the unconvincing explana-
tion that small-cap stocks must be riskier than large-cap stocks; we 
just don’t know how to measure these risks.
SCUTTLEBUTT
Philip Fisher touted “scuttlebutt”—talking to a company’s manag-
ers, employees, customers, and suppliers and to knowledgeable peo-
ple in the industry in order to identify able companies with good 
growth prospects. In an efficient market, if it is well known that a 
company is great, its stock should trade at a price that reflects its 
greatness. However, Fisher’s scuttlebutt might be justified by the ar-
gument that Wall Street is fixated with numbers and it takes more 
than numbers to identify a great company.
Since 1983, Fortune magazine has published an annual list of the 
most-admired companies based on surveys of thousands of execu-
tives, directors, and securities analysts. The top 10 (in order) in 2016 
were Apple, Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, Walt 
Disney, Starbucks, Southwest Airlines, FedEx, Nike, and General 
Electric.
I looked at the performance of a stock portfolio of Fortune’s top-
10 companies from 1983 through 2015. In one set of calculations, the 
trading day for the Fortune portfolio was the official publication 
date, which is a few days after the magazine goes on sale. I also 
looked at trading days one to four weeks after the publication date. 
On the trading day each year, the Fortune portfolio was reinvested in 
that year’s ten most admired companies.
The Fortune strategy beat the S&P 500 soundly, with respective 
annual returns of 15 percent versus 10 percent. It is unlikely that this 
difference is some sort of risk premium since the companies se-
lected as America’s most admired are large and financially sound and 
their stocks are likely to be viewed by investors as very safe. By the 

110      MONEY MACHINE
usual statistical measures, they were safer. Nor is the difference in 
returns due to the extraordinary performance of a few companies. 
Nearly 60 percent of the Fortune stocks beat the S&P 500.
This is a clear challenge to the efficient market hypothesis since 
Fortune’s list is readily available public information. I have no com-
pelling explanation for this anomaly. Perhaps Fisher was right. The 
way to beat the market is to focus on scuttlebutt—intangibles that 
don’t show up in a company’s balance sheet—and the Fortune survey 
is the ultimate scuttlebutt.

THE CONSERVATION OF VALUE
The idea is there, locked inside.  
All you have to do is remove the excess stone.
—Michelangelo
M
ergers, stock splits, stock dividends, cash dividends, share 
repurchases, stock sales. Many potentially confusing cor-
porate actions seem difficult to assess. Which are good for share-
holders? Which are bad? Which are meaningless?
Once again, John Burr Williams helps clarify our reasoning, this 
time with his Law of the Conservation of Investment Value: The 
value of a firm depends on the cash it generates, regardless of how 
that cash is packaged or labeled. Nothing is gained or lost by com-
bining two income streams or by splitting income in two and calling 
one part one thing and the rest something else. Many seemingly im-
portant corporate decisions are, in fact, nonevents that do not leave 
$100 bills on the sidewalk.
STOCK SPLITS
A Business Week article was titled “How to Double Your Shares With-
out Spending a Dime.” The secret is to buy a stock before it splits 
2-for-1, doubling the number of shares you own. Sounds great, right? 

112      MONEY MACHINE
Just be sure to buy the stock before it splits. In the Sopranos televi-
sion show, Carmela has been nagging Tony to buy a stock. Finally, 
Tony says, “Let’s buy that stock.” Carmela makes a face: “It split. It’s 
too late, we missed it.”
If it’s so great for shareholders, why don’t all companies split 
their stock? The answer is that stock splits do nothing at all for 
shareholders. A stock split increases the number of shares, true 
enough, but it reduces the value of each share proportionately. The 
real mystery is why companies split their stock.
Consider a company with one million shares valued at $60 apiece, 
or a total market value of $60 million. If the stock splits 2-for-1, with 
no change in the company’s operations, its aggregate market value 
should stay at $60 million, implying a $30 per-share market value: A 
doubling of the shares halves the value of each.
If stock splits are nonevents, why do firms bother? One explana-
tion is that if a company allows its price to rise to $200, $500, or 
$1,000 a share, some investors cannot afford buy it. Periodic splits 
that keep the price per share under $100 keep the stock affordable.
In a market dominated by large institutions, the affordability ar-
gument is a bit strained and sometimes preposterous. American Tel-
net, a television production firm, went public in March 1979 at 50 
cents a share. By August 1980, the firm had yet to sell a television 
show and the price had sagged to 43 3/4 cents. At this point, the firm 
split its stock 5-for-1 so that, according to its president, the stock 
would be “more affordable.” Given the structure of brokerage com-
missions, however, it doesn’t make sense to buy just one share of an 
8-cent stock, and there is no real difference between buying 1,000 
shares at 40 cents each or 5,000 shares at 8 cents each.
A somewhat more satisfactory reason for stock splits is that, tra-
ditionally, blue-chip stocks have traded in the $20 to $100 range, 
and some companies like to stay in that range. If a stock’s price goes 
up to $80 and the firm declares a 2-for-1 split, reducing the price 
back to $40, the split signals to investors that the board of directors 
is confident that the run up was justified—not mindless speculation 

The Conservation of Value      113
that, when it has run its course, will cause the price to collapse to 
below $20, where lesser stocks trade.
A stock that falls below $20 could do a reverse split—for exam-
ple, a 1-for-2 split that halves the number of shares and doubles the 
price. However, resorting to this tactic would be a damaging admis-
sion by the company’s board that the firm’s prospects are not bright 
enough to increase the price soon.
On April 23, 2014, with Apple stock trading at $524.75, Apple an-
nounced a 7-for-1 split. Apple generally has very good reasons for 
doing what it does, so many investors thought that the highly un-
usual choice of a 7-for-1 split reflected the company’s belief that the 
stock price would soon approach $700, which would be $100 after 
the split. They were right. Four months later, Apple popped through 
$100.
For American Telnet, a logical explanation for the 5-for-1 split is 
that splitting its stock down to the penny range may attract specula-
tors who habitually restrict their attention to penny stocks. In sharp 
contrast, Berkshire Hathaway, run by Warren Buffett, has never 
split, even when its shares cost more than $100,000 apiece. In a 
Christmas card to a friend, Buffett wrote, “May you live until B-H 
splits.”
In 1996, with Berkshire Hathaway selling for $33,000 a share, 
outsiders planned to buy Berkshire shares and resell them to inves-
tors in $1,000 pieces through unit investment trusts. Not wanting 
small investors to have to pay sales charges and other administrative 
expenses that such trusts would entail, Berkshire Hathaway issued 
Class B shares—dubbed “Baby Berkshires”—each without voting 
rights and worth one-thirtieth of the regular Class A shares. In Janu-
ary 2010, Class B shares were split 50-to-1, making each worth 
1/1,500 the value of Class A shares. On January 10, 2014, Berkshire A 
closed at $171,322 a share and Berkshire B closed at $114.97 a share.

114      MONEY MACHINE
STOCK DIVIDENDS
A stock dividend is a stock split, only smaller. If a company declares 
a 5 percent stock dividend, stockholders receive five additional 
shares for every 100 shares they hold, which is effectively a 21-for-20 
stock split. The conservation-of-value principle implies that the 
value of each share falls by 5 percent, leaving shareholders no better 
or worse off than before.
Nonetheless, Barron’s Finance and Investment Handbook made this 
silly claim: 
From the corporate point of view, stock dividends conserve 
cash needed to operate the business. From the stockholder 
point of view, the advantage is that additional stock is not 
taxed until sold, unlike a cash dividend.
This claim is misdirected and misleading. Companies and their 
shareholders may well want to retain earnings to finance expansion. 
But there is no need to declare a stock dividend to do so. The com-
pany can expand as planned, and it doesn’t matter at all whether the 
company leaves the number of shares unchanged, declares a 2-for-1 
split, or declares a 21-for-20 split (a 5 percent stock dividend).
As with any stock split, the question is why bother? A stock divi-
dend costs the firm the expenses of administering it and doesn’t give 
shareholders anything. If stockholders feel better off having re-
ceived a stock dividend, they apparently did not notice the offset-
ting dip in the value of each share, perhaps because a small price 
change is lost among the daily fluctuations in stock prices.
Andrew Tobias, a keen observer of the stock market, offers a sim-
ilar explanation for why companies declare stock dividends:
The only difference between a stock dividend and a stock 
split is that, being a very small split, it is hoped that no pro-
spective buyers will notice that it has taken place. . . . Some-
times it actually works.

The Conservation of Value      115
By this logic, stock dividends are like candy-bar inflation: The com-
pany shrinks the bar and hopes that consumers will continue to pay 
full price. If so, Mr. Market is truly dumb.
Writing in the Harvard Business Review, a finance professor ar-
gued that stock dividends are real events and they are bad:
What about stock dividends, which are theoretically used as 
a way of sharing profits while conserving cash? . . . As I see 
it, the trouble with this approach is that shares outstanding 
increase at a compound rate. It’s a 5% stock dividend this 
year, but next year it’s 5% of 105%, and so forth. This pat-
tern holds down growth in earnings per share.
Once again, the conservation-of-value principle guides us to the 
truth. Stock dividends are nonevents. Yes, stock dividends (like 
stock splits) reduce earnings per share, but they also increase the 
number of shares, leaving earnings per shareholder constant.
What this finance professor’s bogus argument really demon-
strates is another reason why we should not worship earnings per 
share. There are lots of ways that companies can increase earnings 
per share without benefitting shareholders:
1.	 Invest in marginally profitable ventures.
2.	 Acquire companies with low price-earnings ratios.
3.	 Do a reverse stock split.
A 1974 Wall Street Journal editorial criticized the myopic focus of 
many corporate executives on earnings per share:
A lot of executives believe that if they can figure out a way 
to boost reported earnings, their stock prices will go up even 
if the higher earnings do not represent any underlying eco-
nomic change. In other words, the executives think they are 
smart and the market is dumb. . . .
The market is smart. Apparently the dumb one is the 

116      MONEY MACHINE
corporate executive caught up in the earnings-per-share 
mystique.
A handbook on management consulting printed this editorial and 
then stated, “Unfortunately, our experience shows that many corpo-
rate managers still worship earnings per share, and thus are still bet-
ting that the market is dumb.”
REAL DIVIDENDS
Dividends are paid to those who own the company’s shares on the 
record date. For instance, the board of directors might declare a $1 
dividend to be paid on March 1 to those who own stock on the re-
cord date of February 15. To allow for the processing of transactions, 
the NYSE and most other exchanges use an ex-dividend (excluding 
dividend) date two business days before the record date; those who 
buy the stock ex-dividend do not receive the dividend.
The Get Rich Investment Guide published by Consumers Digest of-
fered this moneymaking tip:
Obviously, one strategy is to know when the stock will go ex-
dividend and buy a day or two before the cutoff. Then you 
can receive the dividends, and you can sell the shares as soon 
as you have [received the dividend].
So, $100 bills are lying on the sidewalk for anyone who can figure 
out when a stock goes ex-dividend? That doesn’t seem difficult, so 
there must be a flaw in this strategy. The flaw is that a stock’s price 
falls when it goes ex-dividend.
Consider a company with one million shares valued at $100. If 
the company pays a $1 dividend, the aggregate market value of the 
company falls from $100 million to $99 million, because its assets 
have been reduced by the $1 million it paid in dividends. The price 
of each share should drop to $99. Someone who buys the stock for 
$100 before it goes ex-dividend gets the $1 dividend, but can only 

The Conservation of Value      117
sell the stock for $99. (I’m ignoring other, unpredictable price 
changes.)
If dividends are nonevents, why bother? Some shareholders may 
welcome using dividends to pay their bills, but they could always sell 
some of their stock. This is a classic puzzle in finance—why do com-
panies pay dividends? One answer is that cash dividends are clear 
and unambiguous proof that the firm really is making money. Firms 
can use creative accounting to create an illusion of profits, but you 
can’t fake dividends. Firms that pay dividends are making real prof-
its, not imaginary ones. 
DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLANS
Many companies have dividend reinvestment plans that allow 
shareholders to use their dividends to buy additional shares of 
stock. Shareholders avoid brokerage fees and the company raises 
cash without paying fees to an underwriter. It sounds like win-win 
but it isn’t because shareholders must pay taxes on dividends they 
don’t receive.
Consider again a firm with one million shares priced at $100 a 
share, and suppose the company pays a $1 dividend and all share-
holders participate in a dividend reinvestment plan. What happens? 
The total number of shares increases by one percent, and the value 
of each share declines proportionately. Each shareholder continues 
to own the same fraction of the company’s shares as before. The 
only difference is that shareholders must pay income taxes on divi-
dends they didn’t get. It is as if the company sent a notice to its 
shareholders every three months: “The company is doing fine; please 
send money to the IRS.” 

118      MONEY MACHINE
STOCK REPURCHASES AND SALES
A legendary fund manager wrote, “If a company buys back half its 
shares and its overall earnings stay the same, the earnings per share 
have just doubled.” The obvious flaw is that the firm may have to liq-
uidate half its assets to buy back half its stock. How can earnings 
stay the same if the firm gets rid of half its assets?
Consider a company with 20 million shares outstanding, each 
valued at $20 (an aggregate market value of $400 million). This firm 
has $20 million in cash to distribute to its shareholders. One alter-
native is to pay a $1 dividend per share; another is to purchase one 
million shares at $20 apiece.
Table 8-1 shows the consequences for this company. Either way, 
the $20 million payout reduces the firm’s total value from $400 mil-
lion to $380 million. If the firm pays a $1 dividend, there is a $1 drop 
in its stock price and shareholder wealth is unchanged. If the firm 
repurchases shares, the number of shares declines by one million, 
leaving the price at $20 and again making shareholders no better or 
worse off.

Remember that we are comparing purely financial transactions in 
order to show that share repurchases are equivalent to dividend pay-
ments. Repurchases would increase the stock price if the firm 
bought the stock with money that would otherwise be wasted on 
unprofitable ventures. But it is the abandonment of the money-­

losing projects that raises the price of the stock, not the decision to 
distribute the proceeds through repurchases instead of dividends.
A comanager of the Federated Strategic Value Dividend Fund 
gave this answer to the query, “Why isn’t it better for companies to 
engage in stock buybacks [instead of paying dividends]?”:
A dollar of dividends, albeit highly taxed, is still a check in 
the mail. A share repurchase goes off into the ether and 
never benefits Main Street. It’s just money that could’ve 
come to you that didn’t.
True, a dividend puts cash in shareholders’ pockets, but they can al-
ways get cash by selling some of their shares—in essence, a share-
holder-determined dividend policy.
Taxes give share repurchases a clear advantage over dividends. 
Shareholders pay taxes on dividends, but they do not pay capital 
gains taxes unless they realize their gains by selling—and, even then, 
they don’t pay taxes on the entire sale, only the capital gain (if any). 
A dividend gives shareholders no alternative but to take the cash 
and pay taxes. With a share repurchase, shareholders have a choice. 
Either they can sell shares and pay taxes on the capital gains, or they 
can let their investment ride.
If a share repurchase is like a dividend, issuing new shares must 
be equivalent to reducing dividends. It is.
Our conclusion is that except for the benefits from avoiding 
taxes on dividends, a stock repurchase is equivalent to paying divi-
dends and a stock sale is equivalent to reducing dividends.
STOCKS AS A HEDGE AGAINST INFLATION
Investors ought to find protection from inflation by stockpiling 
things going up in price. If the price of soup is going up, buy soup 
before the price goes up. But it is impossible to store some things, 
such as medical services, and expensive to store others, such as 

120      MONEY MACHINE
­automobiles. Some assets are beyond the budgets of most inves-
tors—Iowa farmland, Arizona shopping centers, Dallas skyscrapers. 
Perhaps one way to invest in real assets that may appreciate with in-
flation is to buy stock in companies that own land, buildings, and 
other tangible assets.
In the long run, dividends, earnings, and stock prices have in-
creased faster than consumer prices. From 1900 to 2015, the con-
sumer price index increased at an average annual rate of 3 percent 
while the S&P 500 stock index increased by 5 percent a year. If we 
add in dividends, investors have averaged more than a 6 percent an-
nual real (inflation-adjusted) return from stocks.
In the short run, however, increases in the rate of inflation have 
not increased stock prices reliably. Figure 8-1 compares the high-­
inflation 1970s with the low-inflation 1960s. In each decade, real 
output increased by 30 percent. In the 1960s, consumer prices rose 
by 25 percent and stock prices nearly doubled. In the 1970s, con-
sumer prices doubled and stock prices were virtually unchanged, 
causing the real value of stocks to fall by 50 percent.
Many investors who suffered through the inflationary 1970s drew 
the understandable conclusion that inflation is bad for the stock 
market. However, the facts do not support this simplistic belief any 
more than they support the equally simple belief that inflation is 
good for the market. Figure 8-2 is a scatter diagram of the annual 
rate of inflation and the return on stocks (dividend plus capital gain) 
each year from 1926 to 2015. The correlation is a meaningless 0.01. 
In the long run, stock prices have increased more than consumer 
prices. In the short run, there is no relationship between the infla-
tion and stock returns.
One explanation is that stockholders are not buying assets. They 
are buying the profits that come from assets, and after-tax profits do 
not move in lockstep with inflation.

ACCOUNTING FOR INFLATION
After-tax corporate profits often suffer during inflationary periods 
because taxes are levied on profits calculated according to more or 
less standard accounting principles, and some of these principles 
don’t make much sense during inflations. For instance, accountants 
spread out the cost of buildings, machines, and equipment with an 
annual depreciation expense that, in theory, reflects what it costs to 
replace things as they wear out. In practice, depreciation expenses 
are based on original costs, which is like figuring labor costs on the 
basis of wages twenty years ago. The result is that inflation causes 
capital costs to be understated and profits to be overstated so that 
businesses, particularly those with lots of buildings, machines, and 
equipment, pay higher taxes.
On the other hand, conventionally measured profits are mislead-
ingly low during inflations to the extent they ignore capital gains on 
corporate assets and liabilities. Just as households profit when they 
borrow at a fixed interest rate to buy a house whose value increases 
during an inflation, so do corporations that borrow to buy buildings 
and equipment. Yet such gains are not included in reported profits 
unless the firm sells its real estate or retires its debt.
A relatively straightforward approach for valuing stock during in-
flationary periods is to remember that investors are not buying some 
accountant’s reckoning of profits but the actual cash, the dividends, 
that stocks provide. Figure 8-3 shows real, inflation-adjusted divi-
dends for the S&P 500 from 1950 to 2015. After growing at a 3.4 per-
cent annual rate from 1950 to 1966, real dividends peaked in 1966 
and declined sharply in the early 1970s. It wasn’t until 1989 that real 
dividends returned to the level reached in 1966. The 1970s were the 
most inflationary decade in memory, and dividends did not keep up 
with consumer prices.
If real dividends had kept growing at 3.4 percent annually during 
the inflationary 1970s, dividends would have been 70 percent higher 

The Conservation of Value      123
in 1980. Real dividends have spurted higher since 2000, even though 
the annual rate of inflation has only been about 2 percent.
Yes, dividends have gone up faster than inflation in the long run. 
No, dividends do not reliably rise and fall with inflation.

WE’RE ONLY HUMAN
There is nothing so disastrous as a rational  
investment policy in an irrational world.
—John Maynard Keynes
S
ears is a legendary American success story. Sears began as a 
mail-order catalog selling everything from watches and toys to 
cars and ready-to-assemble houses and evolved into the nation’s 
largest retailer. Sears was in the Dow Jones Average for seventy-five 
years, but struggled in the 1990s to compete with discount retailers 
like Walmart, Target, and Home Depot. Sales and profits fell, and 
Sears stock price dropped nearly 50 percent between June and No-
vember 1999. Home Depot, on the other hand, was opening a new 
store every fifty-six hours. Its tools competed directly with the leg-
endary Craftsman tools from Sears, and it was winning the battle. 
Home Depot’s stock rose 50 percent between June and November 
1999. On November 1, 1999, Home Depot replaced Sears in the 
Dow Jones Industrial Average.
Sears stock subsequently outperformed Home Depot. It wasn’t a 
fluke and it wasn’t that Home Depot had been jinxed by being in-
cluded in the Dow. It had everything to do with how stock prices are 
affected by human emotions that can leave $100 bills on the side-
walk. Let’s look at several examples.

We’re Only Human      125
ANCHORING
Anchoring is a general human tendency to rely on a reference point 
when making decisions. A student did a term paper in one of my sta-
tistics classes in which randomly selected students were asked one 
of these two questions:
The population of Bolivia is 5 million.
Estimate the population of Bulgaria.
The population of Bolivia is 15 million.
Estimate the population of Bulgaria.
Those who were told that Bolivia’s population was 15 million tended 
to give higher answers than did those told that Bolivia’s population 
was 5 million. Several similar questions confirmed this pattern. Peo-
ple use the known “fact” as an anchor for their guess.
When we buy a car, we tend to judge whether we are getting a 
good deal by comparing the final negotiated price to the dealer’s ini-
tial price, no matter how unrealistic the initial price. Thus, a good 
salesman starts the haggling with a high price.
In real estate, many people use the price they paid for their home 
as an anchor for its current value: “Our house can’t be worth 
$300,000; we bought it for $400,000.” This anchoring causes some 
homeowners to behave in ways that are, well, irrational.
Figure 9-1 shows that the average price of condominiums in Bos-
ton nearly tripled between 1982 and 1988 and then fell by almost 35 
percent over the next five years.
People who paid low prices for their condos in the early 1980s could 
make profits selling in the early 1990s, but people who bought in the 
late 1980s would have losses. A study found that sellers facing losses 
tended to ask higher prices for their condos. Not surprisingly, their 
high-priced condos went unsold. These condo owners were using their 
purchase price as an anchor for what their condos were worth and 
were so averse to taking a loss that they would rather not sell.

126      MONEY MACHINE
FIGURE 9-1. Boston condominium prices, 1982–1993
This behavior was not rational. There is no reason why condos 
purchased during a time of high prices are worth more than condos 
purchased during a time of low prices. It certainly makes no differ-
ence to buyers. If it makes a difference to sellers, they pay for their 
irrationality by not being able to sell their condos.
People also use anchoring to gauge whether interest rates are 
high or low. A family I know (I’ll call them Greg and Jane Landon) 
bought their first house in Eugene, Oregon, in 1971. Figure 9-2 shows 
that going back to at least 1920, mortgage rates had never been 
above 6 percent until they broke the 6 percent barrier in 1966 and 
hit 7.5 percent in 1971.
Greg thought they should wait to buy a home until mortgage 
rates went back to “normal” levels; that is, below 6 percent. Greg 
was using past mortgage rates as an anchor to gauge what mortgage 
rates should be.
But interest rates aren’t governed by physical laws, like gravity or 
magnetism, that force them to behave in easily predictable ways. 
Just because mortgage rates had been 6 percent in the past doesn’t 
mean they will be 6 percent in the future. Jane persuaded Greg that 
they should buy a home to call their own. Greg grimaced and they

Seven years later, in 1978, they moved to Houston, Texas, and 
mortgage rates were now 9.6 percent (see Figure 9-3).

Greg was even more certain that they should wait for mortgage 
rates to return to normal. But the value of their Oregon home had 
doubled and, at that time, sellers had to pay a 35 percent capital 
gains tax on the profit they made from their homes, unless they pur-
chased a new home—in which case the capital gain was rolled over 
and the tax was deferred, perhaps indefinitely. So Greg gritted his 
teeth and they bought a home in Houston with a 9.6 percent 
­mortgage.
Three years later, in 1981, they moved to Seattle. Now they would 
have to pay capital gains taxes on their Eugene and Houston homes 
unless they bought another house. Unfortunately, mortgage rates 
were now above 17 percent (Figure 9-4).
FIGURE 9-4.	The Landons buy their third home, when mortgage rates are

Fortunately, Greg’s new company had an employee mortgage plan 
that would lend them money at 8.7 percent. Greg was much happier 
with 8.7 percent than with 17 percent, but he thought they would be 
even better off if they waited for mortgage rates to return to normal. 
The deciding factor was the annoying capital gains tax they would

have to pay if they didn’t buy. So, they bought a home in Seattle with 
an 8.7 percent mortgage.
Finally, in 2003 mortgage rates fell below 6 percent (Figure 9-5). 
Mortgage rates had returned to normal, just as Greg had predicted! 
But it took forty years. If the Landons had waited to buy a home 
until mortgage rates went back to 6 percent, they would have missed 
out on the best investments they made in their entire lives: their 
homes in Eugene, Houston, and Seattle.
One moral of this story is, don’t try to time the real estate mar-
ket. Another is to watch out for anchors that might sink you.

You have season tickets to college football games in the Midwest. 
Come November, the team sucks and the weather is worse. Do you 
go to games because you already paid for the tickets? The relevant 
question is whether you would be happier at the game or some-
where else.
There is nothing to be gained and much to be lost by moping 
about things you can’t change. Things that can’t be changed are 
called sunk costs. The ice cream sundae you bought but would get sick 
finishing is a sunk cost. So are tickets to a miserable football game. 
So is the price you paid for a stock. Yet many investors are reluctant 
to sell losers, despite the tax benefit, because selling for a loss is an 
admission that they made a mistake buying the stock in the first 
place.
In the early 1980s a famous Yale professor boasted to a friend of 
mine that he made 25 percent a year during the terrible bear market 
in the 1970s. Surely, my friend asked, you must have bought some 
stocks that went down? He nearly fell out of his chair laughing when 
the Yale professor replied, “Yes, but I haven’t sold them yet!” Then 
my friend realized that the professor was not trying to be funny.
The price you pay for a stock is a sunk cost. We should think 
about whether a stock is cheap or expensive at its current price, not 
whether the price is higher or lower than the price we paid, but it is 
hard to forget that sunk cost.
A BREAKEVEN MENTALITY
Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky observed that betting on long 
shots at horse races picks up toward the end of the day, presumably 
because people are looking for a cheap opportunity to win back 
what they lost earlier in the day. They argued that a “person who has 
not made peace with his losses is likely to accept gambles that would 
be unacceptable to him otherwise.”
Two students and I looked at the strategies used by experienced 

We’re Only Human      131
Texas Hold ’Em poker players. We found that most played looser 
after a big loss (betting so that they could stay in with hands they 
would normally fold). They evidently remembered their big losses 
and were eager to win back what they had lost.
Is this riskier play punished? It seems likely that experienced 
players generally use sound strategies, and that any changes are a 
mistake. That’s what happened. Players who played looser after a big 
loss were less successful than they were with their normal playing 
style.
If investors are like poker players, they may be tempted to make 
long-shot investments to recoup losses. A February 2009 article in 
the Wall Street Journal reported that many investors were respond-
ing to their stock market losses by making increasingly risky 
­investments:
The financial equivalent of a “Hail Mary pass”—the desper-
ate attempt, far from the goal line and late in a losing game, 
to fling the football as hard and as high as you can, hoping it 
will somehow come down for a score and wipe out your 
­deficit.
Try not to let a breakeven mentality lure you into Hail Mary 
­investments.
REGRESSION TO THE MEAN
Horace Secrist had a distinguished career as a professor of econom-
ics at Northwestern University. He wrote thirteen textbooks and 
was director of Northwestern’s Bureau of Economic Research. In 
1933, in the depths of the national economic tragedy that became 
known as the Great Depression, he published a book that he hoped 
would explain the cause, provide solutions, and secure his legacy.
Secrist and his assistants spent ten years collecting and analyzing 
data for seventy-three different industries, including department 

132      MONEY MACHINE
stores, clothing stores, hardware stores, railroads, and banks. He 
compiled annual data for the years 1920 to 1930 on several metrics 
of business success, including the ratios of profits to sales and prof-
its to assets. For each ratio, he divided the companies in an industry 
into quartiles based on the 1920 values of the ratio: the top 25 per-
cent, the second 25, the third 25, and the bottom 25. He then calcu-
lated the average ratio from 1920 to 1930 for the stocks in each 1920 
quartile. He found that the companies in the top two quartiles in 
1920 were more nearly average in 1930, and that the companies in 
the bottom two quartiles in 1920 were also more nearly average in 
1930.
He had evidently discovered a universal economic truth. Ameri-
can business was converging to mediocrity. His book documenting 
his discovery was titled The Triumph of Mediocrity in Business. The 
book was a statistical tour de force, 468 pages long, with 140 tables 
and 103 charts, supporting his remarkable discovery.
Then a brilliant statistician named Harold Hotelling wrote a dev-
astating review that politely but firmly demonstrated that Secrist 
had wasted ten years proving nothing at all. What Secrist became 
famous for was being fooled by regression toward the mean.
THE STATISTICAL FALLACY
I once did some research with a student on regression to the mean 
in baseball. Not 468 pages, but at least we recognized regression 
when we saw it. A referee for the journal that published our paper 
wrote:
There are few statistical facts more interesting than regres-
sion to the mean for two reasons. First, people encounter it 
almost every day of their lives. Second, almost nobody un-
derstands it.
The coupling of these two reasons makes regression to 
the mean one of the most fundamental sources of error in 

We’re Only Human      133
human judgment, producing fallacious reasoning in medi-
cine, education, government, and, yes, even sports.
Yes, we encounter regression to the mean almost every day and, yes, 
almost nobody understands it. This is a lethal combination—as Se-
crist discovered.
To understand regression, suppose that 100 people are asked 
twenty questions about world history. Each person’s “ability” is 
what his or her average score would be on a large number of these 
tests. Some people have an ability of 90, some 80, and some near 
zero.
Someone with an ability of 80 will average 80, but is not going 
to get 80 percent correct on every test. Imagine a test bank with 
zillions of questions. By the luck of the draw, a person with an abil-
ity of 80 will know the answers to more than 80 percent of the 
questions on one test and to fewer than 80 percent on another 
test. A person’s score on any single test is an imperfect measure of 
ability.
What, if anything, can we infer from someone’s test score? A key 
insight is that a person whose test score is high relative to the others 
who took the test probably also had a high score relative to his or 
her own ability. Someone who scores in the 90th percentile could be 
someone of more modest ability (perhaps the 85th, 80th, or 75th 
percentile in ability) who did unusually well, or someone of higher 
ability (perhaps the 95th percentile in ability) who did poorly. The 
former is more likely because there are more people with ability 
below the 90th percentile than above it.
If this person’s ability is, in fact, below the 90th percentile, then 
when this person takes another test, his or her score will probably 
also be below the 90th percentile. Similarly, a person who scores 
well below average is likely to have had an off day and should antici-
pate scoring somewhat higher on another test. This tendency of 
people who score far from the mean to score closer to the mean on 
a second test is an example of regression toward the mean.

134      MONEY MACHINE
Regression does not imply that everyone will soon get the same 
score on history tests, only that scores fluctuate around ability.
SECRIST’S FOLLY
In the same way, Secrist’s study of successful and unsuccessful com-
panies involved regression toward the mean. In any given year, the 
most successful companies are likely to have had more good luck 
than bad and to have done well not only relative to other firms, but 
also relative to their own long-run profitability. The opposite is true 
of the least successful companies. This is why the subsequent per-
formance of the top and bottom companies is usually closer to the 
average company. At the same time, their places at the extremes are 
taken by other companies experiencing fortune or misfortune. 
These fluctuations do not mean that all companies will soon be me-
diocre. As Hotelling put it, Secrist “really prove[d] nothing more 
than that the ratios in question have a tendency to wander about.”
REGRESSION IN THE STOCK MARKET
In Against the Gods, a bestselling, prize-winning book, Peter Bern-
stein wrote:
The track records of professional investment managers are 
also subject to regression to the mean. There is a strong 
probability that the hot manager of today will be the cold 
manager of tomorrow, or at least the day after tomorrow, 
and vice versa. . . . [T]he wisest strategy is to dismiss the 
manager with the best track record and to transfer one’s as-
sets to the manager who has been doing the worst; this strat-
egy is no different from selling stocks that have risen the 
furthest and buying stocks that have fallen furthest.

We’re Only Human      135
Bernstein is wise, but this is not wisdom. The idea that the best will 
be worst and the worst will be best is the gambler’s fallacy that good 
luck makes bad luck more likely. It is false and it is not regression to 
the mean. Regression occurs because the managers with the best 
track records probably benefited from good luck and are conse-
quently not as far above average in ability as they seem. If there is 
any skill to stock picking, the person with the best track record can 
be expected to outperform the person with the worst record, but 
not by as much next year as last year. If stock picking is all luck, you 
may as well pick managers randomly—or save money by not using a 
manager at all—but there is no reason to choose the worst manager.
SHRUNKEN EARNINGS PREDICTIONS ARE 
BETTER PREDICTIONS
There is regression to the mean in stocks, as well as managers. A 
natural tendency in the stock market, where investors hope to in-
vest in the next IBM, Walmart, or Google, is to see a year or two 
of rapidly increasing earnings and assume many years of similar 
rapid growth. Regression teaches us that a company with earnings 
up by 20 percent this year (or over the past few years) is more 
likely to have experienced good luck than bad luck and, most 
likely, will regress toward the mean in the future, disappointing 
overly optimistic investors. 
Something very similar is true of predicted earnings. The most 
optimistic predictions are more likely to be overly optimistic than 
to be excessively pessimistic, so the companies with the most opti-
mistic forecasts probably won’t do as well as predicted.
Two colleagues and I investigated this reasoning. Regression re-
lates to relative values. Our guiding principle was that firms whose 
growth rates are predicted to be far from the mean will probably 
have growth rates closer to the mean. So, we adjusted the analysts’ 
forecasts by shrinking them toward the average forecast for all 

136      MONEY MACHINE
companies. Our adjusted forecasts were more accurate than the an-
alysts’ forecasts 70 percent of the time, which is better than a 
2-to-1 margin.
We didn’t use spreadsheets to predict market share, revenue, ex-
penses, and the like. We didn’t even look at the company names. We 
just downloaded the forecast earnings growth rates and shrunk 
them toward the overall mean, using a marvelous statistical formula 
known as Kelley’s equation, and we out-predicted the professional 
predictors.
If investors are paying attention to these professional analysts (or 
making similar predictions themselves), stock prices are likely to be 
too high for companies with optimistic forecasts and too low for 
those with pessimistic forecasts—mistakes that will be corrected 
when earnings regress to the mean. If this conjecture is correct, 
stocks with relatively pessimistic earnings predictions may outper-
form stocks with relatively optimistic predictions.
Five portfolios were formed each year based on the analysts’ pre-
dicted earning growth for the current fiscal year. The most optimis-
tic portfolio consisted of the 20 percent of the stocks with the 
highest predicted growth. The most pessimistic portfolio contained 
the 20 percent with the lowest predicted growth. The stock returns 
were then calculated for each portfolio over the next twelve months. 
A similar procedure was used for the year-ahead earnings forecasts, 
but the stock returns were calculated over the next twenty-four 
months.
Table 9-1 shows the results. The pessimistic portfolios trounced 
the optimistic portfolios. It is hard to imagine that this trouncing 
reflects some kind of risk premium. The pessimistic portfolios were 
actually safer.
The most plausible explanation is that the market’s insufficient 
appreciation of regression to the mean is leaving $100 bills on the 
sidewalk.

DOW DELETIONS
The Dow Jones Industrial Average is an average of the prices of 
thirty blue-chip stocks that represent the most prominent compa-
nies in the United States. An Averages Committee periodically 
changes the stocks in the Dow, sometimes because a firm merges 
with another company or is taken over by another company. More 
often, though, a company has some tough years and is no longer 
considered to be a blue-chip stock. Such fallen companies are re-
placed by more successful companies; for example, a thriving Home 
Depot replaced a struggling Sears in 1999.
When a faltering company is replaced by a flourishing company, 
which stock do you think does better subsequently—the stock 
going into the Dow or the stock going out? If you take regression 
into account, the stock booted out of the Dow probably will do bet-
ter than the stock that replaces it.
This is counterintuitive because it is tempting to confuse a great 
company with a great stock. LeanMean may have a long history of 
strong, stable profits. But is it a good investment? The answer de-
pends on the stock’s price. Is it an attractive investment at $10 a 
share? $100? $1,000? There are prices at which the stock is too ex-
pensive. There are prices at which the stock is cheap. No matter 

138      MONEY MACHINE
how good the company, value investors need to know the stock’s 
price before deciding whether it is an attractive investment.
Regarding Dow additions and deletions, the question for value 
investors is not whether the companies going into the Dow are 
doing better than the companies they are replacing, but which 
stocks are better investments. The stocks going into and out of the 
Dow are all familiar companies that are closely watched by thou-
sands of investors. In 1999, investors were well aware of the fact 
that Home Depot was doing great and Sears was doing poorly. 
Their stock prices surely reflected this knowledge. That’s why 
Home Depot’s stock was up 50 percent, while Sears was down 50 
percent.
However, the regression argument suggests that the companies 
taken out of the Dow are generally not in as dire straits as their re-
cent performance suggests and that the companies replacing them 
are generally not as stellar as they appear. If so, stock prices will 
often be unreasonably low for the stocks going out and undeserv-
edly high for the stocks going in. When a company that was doing 
poorly regresses to the mean, its stock price will rise. When a com-
pany that was doing spectacularly regresses to the mean, its price 
will fall. This argument suggests that stocks deleted from the Dow 
will generally outperform stocks added to the Dow.
Sears was bought by Kmart in 2005, five-and-a-half years after it 
was kicked out of the Dow. If you bought Sears stock just after it was 
deleted from the Dow, your total return until its acquisition by 
Kmart would have been 103 percent. Over the same five-and-a-half-
year period, an investment in Home Depot, the stock that replaced 
Sears, would have lost 22 percent. The S&P 500 index of stock prices 
during this period had a return of –14 percent. Sears had an above-
average return after it left the Dow, while Home Depot had a below-
average return after it entered the Dow. (The Kmart-Sears 
combination has been ugly, but that’s another story.)
Is this comparison of Sears and Home Depot an isolated incident 
or part of a systematic pattern of Dow deletions outperforming 

We’re Only Human      139
Dow additions? There were actually four substitutions in 1999. 
Home Depot, Microsoft, Intel, and SBC replaced Sears, Goodyear 
Tire, Union Carbide, and Chevron. Home Depot, Microsoft, Intel, 
and SBC are all great companies, but all four stocks did poorly over 
the next decade.
Suppose that on the day the four substitutions were made, No-
vember 1, 1999, you had invested $25,000 in each of the four stocks 
added to the Dow, for a total investment of $100,000. This is your 
Addition Portfolio. You also formed a Deletion Portfolio by invest-
ing $25,000 in each of the stocks deleted from the Dow.
After ten years, the S&P 500 was down 23 percent. The Addition 
Portfolio did even worse, down 34 percent. The Deletion Portfolio, 
in contrast, was up 64 percent.
Maybe 1999 was an unusual year and substitutions made in other 
years turned out differently? Nope. In 2006 I did a study with two 
of my students of all fifty changes in the Dow back to October 1, 
1928, when the Dow 30-stock average began; we found that deleted 
stocks did better than the stocks that replaced them in thirty-two 
cases and did worse in eighteen cases. A portfolio of deleted stocks 
beat a portfolio of added stocks by about 4 percent a year, which is 
a huge difference compounded over seventy-eight years. A $100,000 
portfolio of added stocks would have grown to $160 million by 
2006; a $100,000 portfolio of deleted stocks would have grown to 
$3.3 billion. The companies doing so poorly that they were booted 
out of the Dow have been better investments than the darlings that 
replaced them.
Our findings contradict the efficient market hypothesis since 
changes in the composition of the Dow are widely reported and well 
known. Once again, it seems that the market’s neglect of regression 
is leaving $100 bills on the sidewalk.

WOULD A STOCK BY ANY OTHER TICKER 
SMELL AS SWEET?
Several companies have shunned the traditional name-­abbreviation 
convention and chosen ticker symbols that are memorable for their 
cheeky cleverness. Southwest Airlines’ choice of LUV as its ticker 
symbol was related to its efforts to brand itself as an airline “built on 
love.” Southwest is based at Dallas Love Field and has an open-seat-
ing policy that reportedly can lead to romance between strangers 
who sit next to each other. Its onboard snacks were originally called 
“love bites” and its drinks “love potions,” and a Southwest spokes-
man boasted about the number of romances that started on South-
west flights: “At times, we feel that we are the love brokers of the 
sky.”
Perhaps a clever ticker symbol is an indicator that a firm’s manag-
ers are smart and creative, with a sense of humor. On the other 
hand, wary investors may interpret a clever symbol as a silly market-
ing ploy by a company that feels it must resort to gimmicks to at-
tract investor attention. Perhaps a clever symbol is a signal of 
desperation rather than intelligence.
Another possibility is that clever ticker symbols matter because 
they are memorable. There is considerable evidence that human 
judgments are shaped by how easily information is processed and 
­remembered:
1. Objects shown for longer periods of time or with greater 
background contrast are rated more favorably.
2. Statements like “Osorno is in Chile” are more likely to be 
judged true if written in colors that are easier to read.
3. Aphorisms that rhyme are more likely to be judged true; for 
example, “Woes unite foes” versus “Woes unite enemies.”
These arguments suggest that ticker symbols that are easily pro-
cessed and recalled might be rated favorably. For example, an inves-

We’re Only Human      141
tor might look at pet-related companies and come across VCA 
Antech, which operates a network of animal hospitals and diagnos-
tic laboratories. A ticker symbol VCAA might pass unnoticed. But 
the actual ticker symbol, WOOF, is memorable. Perhaps a few days, 
weeks, or months later, this investor decides to invest in a pet-­
related company and remembers the symbol WOOF. (In a weird co-
incidence, it was a former student of mine who thought up the 
ticker WOOF.)
Two students and I looked at whether ticker symbols matter. Be-
cause cleverness is in the eye of the beholder, we used a survey to 
identify ticker symbols that people consider witty. First, we sifted 
through 33,000 ticker symbols for past and present companies, 
looking for ticker symbols that might be considered noteworthy. 
Ninety-three percent of our selections coincided. We merged the 
lists and discarded ticker symbols that were simply an abbreviation 
of the company’s name (BEAR for Bear Automotive Service Equip-
ment and GLAD for Gladstone Capital) and kept symbols that 
showed ingenuity (GRRR for Lion Country Safari parks and MOO 
for United Stockyards).
We distributed 100 surveys with our culled list of 358 ticker sym-
bols, the company names, and a brief description of each company’s 
business. We intentionally excluded seasoned investment profes-
sionals whose choices might have been influenced by the invest-
ment performance of the companies on the list.
For each trading day from the beginning of 1984 (when clever 
ticker symbols started becoming popular) to the end of 2005, we cal-
culated the daily return for a portfolio of the clever-ticker stocks 
that received the most votes in our survey. Figure 9-6 shows that the 
clever-ticker portfolio lagged behind the market portfolio slightly 
until 1993 and then spurted ahead. Overall, the compounded annual 
returns were 24 percent for the clever-ticker portfolio and 12 per-
cent for the market portfolio.

142      MONEY MACHINE
FIGURE 9-6. Clever-ticker portfolio relative to market
The market-beating performance was not because the clever-ticker 
stocks were concentrated in one industry. Our eighty-two clever-
ticker companies span thirty-one of the eighty-one industry catego-
ries used by the U.S. government, with the highest concentration 
being eight companies in eating and drinking places, of which four 
beat the market and four did not. Nor was it due to the extraordi-
nary performance of a small number of clever-ticker stocks: 65 per-
cent of the clever-ticker stocks beat the market.
We do not know why these stocks did so well. Perhaps a clever 
ticker is a useful barometer of the managers’ ability, which reveals it-
self over time as the firm repeatedly exceeds investors’ expectations. 
Or perhaps a clever ticker matters because it is memorable and has 
a subtle but persistent influence on investors who buy the stock. Ei-
ther way, it’s an unexpected $100 bill on the sidewalk.

puters? Computers don’t have emotions, and well-written software 
doesn’t have inconsistencies. True enough, but computers don’t have 
common sense, either. Computers can identify statistical patterns 
but cannot gauge whether there is a logical basis for the discovered 
patterns.
When a statistical correlation between gold and silver prices was 
discovered in the 1980s, how could a computer possibly discern 
whether there was a sensible basis for this statistical correlation? In 
the 1990s, Long-Term Capital Management was bankrupted by a 
number of bets on correlations that did not have a persuasive expla-
nation; for example, relationships among various French and Ger-
man interest rates. A manager later lamented that “we had academics 
who came in with no trading experience and they started modeling 
away. Their trades might look good given the assumptions they 
made, but they often did not pass a simple smell test.”
Humans do make mistakes, leaving profitable opportunities for 
others, but humans also have the potential to recognize those mis-
takes and to avoid being seduced by patterns that lead computers 
astray.

THE RIGHT ATTITUDE
Human behavior flows from three main sources:  
desire, emotion, and knowledge.

ome people think you can’t go wrong buying stocks, at least in 
the long run. Others think that stocks are like a trip to Vegas, 
where most people return home with less money than they came 
with. Both are wrong. The stock market is more nuanced than these 
simplistic caricatures. Historically, investors have, on average, made 
a lot of money, but there is no guarantee how future investors 
will do.
Table 10-1 shows the average annual returns from short-term 
Treasury bills, long-term Treasury bonds, and the stocks included in 
the S&P 500 index. The standard deviation is a measure of the vola-
tility of the annual returns about the historical average. The table 
uses a peculiar starting year (1926) simply because that’s as far back 
as these data go.

The average annual return on the stocks in the S&P 500 has been 12 
percent, which is not only positive but much higher than the aver-
age returns from Treasury bills or bonds. An investment of $10,000 
is worth $931,000 after forty years if it earns a 12 percent annual re-
turn, but only worth $103,000 with a 6 percent return.
Stocks have also been volatile, with an annual standard deviation 
twice that of Treasury bonds. Figure 10-1 confirms visually what the 
standard deviation tells us numerically—the stock market fluctuates 
a lot from year to year. Stock returns also seem random in that there 
is no evident pattern.
FIGURE 10-1. Annual returns from S&P 500 stocks since 1926
As Figure 10-1 shows, the stock market often rises or falls more than 
20 percent in a year. Stock prices also fluctuate wildly month to 
month, week to week, and even daily. On October 19, 1987, stock 
prices fell by more than 20 percent in a single day, sending many in-
vestors to the sidelines, convinced that the stock market is too risky. 
That was a costly overreaction. The market bounced back and in-
vestors who have been invested in stocks since October 19, 1987, 
have done much better than have those who left the market.

The S&P 500 also conceals the turbulence in individual stocks. A 
stock can double or be worthless in minutes.
A financial author once wrote:
An exhaustive computer survey, conducted a few years ago 
at the University of Chicago, showed that the average an-
nual profit (before taxes) on any New York Stock Exchange 
investment held for one month or longer—regardless of 
what the company was, when the shares were purchased or 
when they were sold—was 9.3 percent.
The 9.3 number would now be 12 percent, but that’s not the biggest 
problem with this claim. The stock market doesn’t go straight up 
and all stocks don’t do equally well. The return depends on the stock 
and when it is bought and sold.
Figure 10-2 shows the daily prices of two popular stocks, Apple 
and Washington Mutual Saving Bank (commonly known as WaMu) 
between 1983 and 2003. In March 1983, WaMu was $14 a share and 
Apple was $42. The zig-zags in Figure 10-2 show that both stocks 
fluctuated greatly over the next twenty years, with Apple going 
above $140 in 2000 and below $20 in 2003. Meanwhile, WaMu was 
above $40 in 2003, triple its value twenty years earlier.

WaMu was on its way to becoming the nation’s largest saving and

We hope to do to this industry what Wal-Mart did to theirs, 
Starbucks did to theirs, Costco did to theirs and Lowe’s-
Home Depot did to their industry. And I think if we’ve done 
our job, five years from now you’re not going to call us a bank.
He was right. Five years later, people didn’t call WaMu a bank. They 
called it bankrupt. In fact, the biggest bank bankruptcy ever.
WaMu’s growth was fueled by loans to people who other banks 
considered too risky, and its downfall came from losses on these sub-
prime loans and then a run on the bank as nervous depositors with-
drew $16.7 billion over a ten-day period. The federal government 
took control of WaMu and sold what was left of the wreckage to 
JPMorgan Chase for $1.9 billion.
Meanwhile, Figure 10-3 shows that Apple jumped and slumped, 
hitting $190 in 2008 and falling below $80 in 2009. Apple topped 
$700 in September 2012 and dropped below $400 seven months 
later. Wheee! (Apple did a 7-for-1 stock split in January 2014 and 
traded for around $100 a share in 2016, which is equivalent to $700 
before the split.)

The Right Attitude      151
The stock market can be like riding a roller coaster, sometimes ex-
hilarating, other times terrifying. Some investors find these roller-
coaster rides so gut wrenching that they avoid stocks altogether. I 
know a woman who keeps her money in a safe in her kitchen. She 
doesn’t want to worry about the stock market crashing, and she 
doesn’t feel that money is real unless she can hold it in her hands. 
Personally, paper money doesn’t seem all that real to me.
For other investors, uncertainty is the main attraction. Investing 
is a game—much like poker—that blends skill and luck, and it can 
be played against professionals with the results reported in the daily 
newspaper and on the internet. It is a game worth playing, and it is 
a game worth winning.
MUTUAL FUNDS
Many investors buy stocks through mutual funds. Mutual funds 
issue shares, like other corporations, but instead of using the share-
holders’ money to build factories and office buildings, they buy 
stocks and bonds. There are thousands of mutual funds catering to 
the specialized and varied tastes of investors. There is a fund for 
baptized Lutherans, one for airline pilots, and another for cemetery 
owners. One fund buys only aviation stocks; another buys stock in 
gold-mining companies. One fund invests in Australian securities; 
one in Ohio businesses. Others do not invest in alcohol, tobacco, 
gambling, or munitions stocks. The Vice Fund does the opposite, 
specializing in sinful industries. 
Many people are drawn to mutual funds by their advertised ex-
pertise, reasoning that just as they pay a doctor for medical services 
and a lawyer for legal assistance, so they should pay a professional 
for investment management. They choose a fund with an outstand-
ing record and if this fund’s subsequent performance is disappoint-
ing, they switch to another fund that has been more successful.
Management fees depend on the number of assets managed, and 

152      MONEY MACHINE
the top-performing funds are swamped by investors looking to share 
in the success. This investor chase for successful funds encourages 
funds to trade feverishly, looking for the quick profits that will lure 
more investors (and management fees).
Like his mentor, Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffett has been 
critical of the hyperkinetic activity of institutional investors who 
speculate about short-term price fluctuations instead of focusing on 
long-term investment values. In a Berkshire annual report, Buffett 
wrote that “the term ‘institutional investor’ is becoming one of 
those self-contradictions called an oxymoron, comparable to ‘jumbo 
shrimp,’ ‘lady mud wrestler’ and ‘inexpensive lawyer.’” I would add 
that “value investor” is not an oxymoron, and that value investors 
should be leery of hyperactive mutual funds.
LOAD CHARGES AND OTHER FEES
Mutual funds can be bought through fund salespeople, insurance 
agents, stockbrokers, or directly from the fund itself. No matter 
which route is used, the fund may levy a sales charge, called a load fee. 
For a “full load” fund, the load is generally between 5 percent and 8.5 
percent, split between the salesperson and the fund itself. Funds 
that sell directly to investors are generally “low loads,” with a fee of 
3 percent or less, all of which goes to the fund. Funds that don’t 
charge load fees are called no-loads.
In addition, SEC Rule 12b-1 allows mutual funds to charge an an-
nual fee—often, one percent or more—to cover marketing expenses 
(including sales commissions). To discourage early redemptions, 
funds with substantial 12b-1 fees may impose early redemption fees 
to ensure that investors either pay several years of 12b-1 fees or a 
substantial redemption fee. David Swensen, Yale’s extraordinary 
portfolio manager, has said, “Shame on the SEC for allowing 12b-1 
fees, shame on the directors for approving them, and shame on the 
mutual funds for assessing them.”

The Right Attitude      153
How do they get away with it? It’s our fault. The Security and Ex-
change Commission requires mutual funds to show all of their 
charges in a standard table in the prospectus, including estimates of 
how these fees affect a $1,000 investment over periods of one to ten 
years. Unfortunately, the table is not mandatory reading. A former 
director of the SEC’s investment management division estimated 
that fewer than 10 percent of mutual fund investors ever open the 
prospectus.
Many mutual fund salespeople capitalize on short-term froth in 
the stock market by focusing their sales pitch on recently successful 
funds, giving the misleading impression that future investors are as-
sured of a similarly spectacular performance. We fall for their babble 
because our dreams of easy riches make us gullible. Mutual fund 
families play this game, too, promoting funds that have had recent 
successes and not mentioning disappointments. Many in the indus-
try suspect that some fund families have hundreds of disparate funds 
and keep creating new funds to ensure that they will have successes 
that can be promoted heavily.
Mutual funds have considerable latitude in reporting past results 
and some of them play sneaky games. For example, if two funds 
merge, the manager can choose which of the two performance re-
cords to attribute to the combined fund. For instance, if Fund A has 
earned 10 percent a year and Fund B has lost 10 percent, the man-
ager can merge B into A and continue to report the fund’s return as 
10 percent a year. John Bogle, founder of the Vanguard Group, 
strongly criticized this practice, observing sarcastically that “we are 
able to get rid of our poor performing funds by merging them into 
sister funds with lustrous records, and the record of the ‘turkey’ sim-
ply vanishes into thin air.” In 1993 Lipper Analytical Services re-
ported that the annual return for diversified U.S. stock funds that 
stayed in business for the entire twenty-year period from 1973 to 
1992 was 11.8 percent, compared to 11.4 percent for the S&P 500. 
However, 40 percent of the funds in business in the 1970s had disap-
peared by 1992. When the performance of these vanished funds is 

154      MONEY MACHINE
taken into account, the annual return for all diversified stock funds 
over this period dropped by more than a percentage point, to 10.5 
percent.
While advertisements may be misleading and salespeople decep-
tive, the Securities and Exchange Commission requires a more com-
plete and accurate disclosure in a mutual fund’s prospectus. One of 
the best ways to see through the hype is to read it carefully. Not 
nearly enough people do.
DO MUTUAL FUNDS BEAT THE MARKET?
Study after study has found that, before expenses, mutual funds do as 
well, on average, as monkeys throwing darts. After expenses, two 
out of three funds do worse than the market. Professionally man-
aged mutual funds charge an unconscionable amount for this infe-
rior performance. As David Swensen wrote, “Overwhelmingly, 
mutual funds extract enormous sums from investors in exchange for 
providing a shocking disservice.”
No problem. Even if two-thirds of the funds do worse than the 
market, just invest in the one-third that beat the market. Right? As 
one market observer put it, “The problem of picking a mutual fund 
seems to be simplicity itself: The investor should select whichever 
fund will give him the largest percentage return, year after year.” 
Sure enough, investors pour money into recently successful mutual 
funds, paying big load fees in the belief that past performance en-
sures future success.
Unfortunately, funds with above-average records in the past are 
no more likely to do well in the future than are funds with below-
average records. This is why the president of Morningstar, an inde-
pendent mutual fund rating service, once said that rating mutual 
funds on their annual performance was “the dumbest thing imagin-
able.” Nonetheless, they started doing just that the next year. There 
is always a market for dumb things.

The Right Attitude      155
INDEX FUNDS
Mutual funds are not the only professionally managed portfolios 
whose performance has been disappointing. Money managers as a 
whole underperform the market after management fees and other 
expenses, and there is little consistency in their performance—
knowing which managers have done well in the past is little help in 
predicting which will do well in the future. As this evidence accumu-
lated in the late 1960s, many realized that if most professionals do 
worse than the market indexes, the way to beat most investment 
professionals is to buy the indexes and keep costs down. Instead of 
trying to pick stocks that might beat a market index, an index fund 
buys the stocks in the index.
In 1971 Wells Fargo Investment Advisors started an index fund 
for pension funds and other institutional investors and soon grew to 
become one of the largest single investors in the stock market; its 
annual management fees are as low as 0.05 percent. John Bogle 
wrote his senior thesis at Princeton on the failure of mutual funds to 
beat the S&P 500 and concluded that the way to beat most mutual 
funds was to buy the stocks in the S&P 500. Bogle founded Van-
guard in 1975 and, a year later, introduced the first index fund open 
to small investors. Vanguard now has more than 200 funds managing 
more than $2 trillion in assets. Its index funds routinely beat two-
thirds of the managed funds.
Many reputable firms offer index funds that essentially own all 
the stocks in a stock market index. One of the most popular is the 
Vanguard 500 Index Fund, which contains the 500 stocks in the 
S&P 500. Because Vanguard does not pay people to pick stocks, the 
expenses are tiny—about 0.16 percent annually, or $16 on a $10,000 
investment. That’s less than the cost of making one trade a year; for 
example, selling Amazon to buy Google.
For an even broader portfolio, the iShares Core S&P Total U.S.

Index portfolios do not beat the market. They are the market. 
But they won’t do worse than the market, either, and that is com-
forting for some investors.
Many wise, seasoned, and admired investors—including Dave 
Swensen and Burton Malkiel—recommend investing in index funds. 
Even Warren Buffett, one of the gods of value investors, wrote in his 
2013 Letter to Berkshire Shareholders that he wants the money he 
leaves to his heirs to be invested in an index fund:
My advice to the trustee couldn’t be more simple: Put 10% 
of the cash in short-term government bonds and 90% in a 
very low-cost S&P 500 index fund. (I suggest Vanguard’s.) I 
believe the trust’s long-term results from this policy will be 
superior to those attained by most investors—whether pen-
sion funds, institutions or individuals—who employ high-
fee managers.
Oddly enough, Buffett did not recommend investing in his own 
company, Berkshire. 
John Bogle’s core argument is correct:
In the stock market, some investors do better and some 
worse, but their aggregate returns equal the market’s re-
turns, minus the costs of investing. After all, they are the 
market. So if a fund matches the market’s gross return and 
does so at a cost much lower than the average fund, it will 
always beat the average fund over time.
Bogle is comparing index funds to other mutual funds, but the same 
argument applies to all investing. If some investors index the mar-
ket, the average return (before expenses) for all other investors must 
equal the index. If the index investors have lower fees and other ex-
penses, they will, on average, do better than investors who do not 
index.

The Right Attitude      157
A reasonable response to the evidence that stock prices are hard 
to predict and that human emotions can lead us astray is to be pas-
sive. Instead of trying to pick the best stocks or the best time to buy 
stocks, buy all stocks and hold them all the time. Indexing is easy 
and cheap, and can shelter us from our emotions run amok.
Suppose, however, that the performance of those who do not 
index is not utterly and completely random. Suppose that there is a 
strategy—value investing—that is successful but not widely fol-
lowed, perhaps because it is hard to control desire and emotion, two 
of Plato’s three pillars of human behavior. If so, while the average 
investor gets an average result, those who have the discipline to be 
value investors do better than other investors. If so, they must do 
better than the average investor and may do better than indexing.
There is truth and wisdom in the advice that ordinary investors 
should park their money in an index fund. Unchecked human emo-
tions can lead us to trade too much, to trust hot tips, to chase 
trends, to be caught up in speculative bubbles and fearful panics. 
Indexing protects us from ourselves. Investors who cannot control 
their desires and emotions should put their savings in a low-cost 
index fund (I love Vanguard, too) and leave it alone. They will sleep 
better and do better than they would being led around by desire 
and emotion.
Yes, indexing protects us from human foibles and follies that can 
lead us into making bad investment decisions. On the other hand, if 
we recognize these human imperfections and are not seduced by 
them, we may be able to take advantage of the fact that human er-
rors and animal spirits create potentially profitable opportunities. 
That is the essence of value investing. Wishful thinking, fads, trend 
chasing, fear, greed, and other human emotions can cause Mr. Mar-
ket’s prices to surge above or collapse below intrinsic values, allow-
ing value investors to buy stocks cheaply and sell stocks profitably.
Those investors who can be true value investors, putting aside 
wishful thinking, greed, fear, and other destructive human tenden-
cies, can do better than indexing.

KISS
It seems that perfection is reached not when there is nothing left 
to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.
—Antoine de Saint-Exupéry
O
ddly enough, my experience as a value investor has taught 
me to keep it simple, stupid (KISS). I have always been a 
full-time professor—teaching, doing research, writing books, spend-
ing time with my spouse, raising six kids. I don’t spend eight hours a 
day studying stocks or following the stock market. Most days, I 
don’t even look at stock prices.
Keynes was a master investor, as well as a master economist, and 
he reportedly made his investment decisions while eating breakfast 
in bed, though his approach was the exact opposite of value invest-
ing. In the wonderful Chapter 12 of his treatise The General Theory of 
Employment, Interest, and Money, which revolutionized economics, 
Keynes argued that it is easier to anticipate changes in investor psy-
chology than it is to estimate the intrinsic value of stocks. He lik-
ened buying and selling stocks to childhood games:
It is, so to speak, a game of Snap, of Old Maid, of Musical 
Chairs—a pastime in which he is victor who says Snap 
­neither too soon nor too late, who passes the Old Maid to 
his neighbour before the game is over, who secures a chair 
for himself when the music stops. These games can be 

KISS      159
played with zest and enjoyment, though all the players know 
that it is the Old Maid which is circulating, or that when the 
music stops some of the players will find themselves 
­unseated.
Keynes explained how the key to winning such games is to under-
stand and anticipate one’s opponents:
Professional investment may be likened to those newspaper 
competitions in which the competitors have to pick out the 
six prettiest faces from a hundred photographs, the prize 
being awarded to the competitor whose choice most nearly 
corresponds to the average preferences of the competitors 
as a whole; so that each competitor has to pick, not those 
faces which he himself finds prettiest, but those which he 
thinks likeliest to catch the fancy of the other competitors, 
all of whom are looking at the problem from the same point 
of view. It is not a case of choosing those which, to the best 
of one’s judgment, are really the prettiest, nor even those 
which average opinion genuinely thinks the prettiest. We 
have reached the third degree where we devote our intelli-
gences to anticipating what average opinion expects the av-
erage opinion to be. And there are some, I believe, who 
practise the fourth, fifth and higher degrees.
This may have been easy for Keynes, but not for me! I share Keynes’s 
enthusiasm for investing in one’s spare time, but I am more com-
fortable buying stocks that are attractively priced than I am trying 
to guess which stocks are going in or out of favor. I play games with 
my children, but not with my investments.
When I have money to invest, I look at well-managed companies 
(as gauged, for example, by Fortune’s annual list of the most admired 
companies) that have large dividends and/or earnings relative to 
their stock price. I am wary of stocks whose prices have increased 
dramatically and tempted by stocks whose prices have fallen, ­figuring 

160      MONEY MACHINE
that I am more likely to find bargains among stocks the market 
hates than among stocks the market loves.
I buy what I like using an inexpensive online broker and forget 
about it. I don’t waste time checking stock prices every day (or 
worse, every hour or minute). I do notice (how can one not notice?) 
if there is a stock market crash. I do notice if bubbly things are hap-
pening (like the Wall Street Journal article about Bill’s Barbershop). 
That’s about it.
Here are a few other KISS rules of thumb.
DISCOUNT BROKERS
Stocks can be bought and sold using full-service brokers such as 
Morgan Stanley, UBS, Merrill Lynch, Edward Jones, and Raymond 
James that compile mountains of data, prepare in-depth analyses, 
and make buy/sell recommendations. Investors have individual ac-
count executives (please don’t call them “brokers”) who give advice 
based on the firm’s research. Many investors appreciate the individ-
ual attention and comfort of having someone help them make deci-
sions, but they pay for it with high fees. In addition, account 
executives have a fundamental conflict of interest since the more 
their customers trade, the more revenue is generated for the broker-
age firm.
Discount brokerage firms, in contrast, do little more than answer 
the phone, give current prices, and record trades. Cheapest of all are 
trades made over the internet without the assistance of account ex-
ecutives or telephone operators. Commissions are lower because 
the firm does not do research or offer advice and doesn’t need as 
many employees to deal with customers. Many discount brokers 
give investors free internet access to enough information to make 
sensible investment decisions.
If you are going to buy and sell stocks yourself, choose a firm that 
offers low-cost online trading, such as Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, 

KISS      161
eTrade, Fidelity, Merrill Edge, or Vanguard, and that gives you free 
access to useful research. If you have a large portfolio, you might 
want to go with more than one broker, because the Securities Inves-
tor Protection Corporation (SIPC) only insures brokerage accounts 
up to $500,000 if a broker goes bust.
BUYING ON MARGIN
Buying stock with money borrowed from a brokerage firm is called 
buying on margin, where the margin is the money the stockholder 
puts up. If you buy 200 shares of ZYX stock for $50 a share (a total 
cost of $10,000), a brokerage firm with a 60 percent margin require-
ment will require you to put up at least $6,000 (and loan you the re-
mainder). The brokerage firm charges you interest on this loan, but, 
as with any leveraged investment, you come out ahead if the rate of 
return on your stock exceeds the interest rate on your loan.
If your equity—the market value of your stock minus your cur-
rent loan balance—falls below a specified maintenance margin, you 
will get a margin call from your broker requesting additional funds. 
The Fed requires a 25 percent maintenance margin, but many bro-
kers use a more conservative 30 to 40 percent.
I’ve never bought stock on margin.
SHORT SALES
If you think a stock’s price is heading downward, you can sell shares 
you don’t own by selling stock that your broker borrows from an-
other investor. This is called a short sale, and it must be covered at 
some point by buying stock to replace the borrowed stock. Short 
sellers try to follow the age-old advice to buy low and sell high, but 
they sell first and buy later.
Short sellers do not receive the proceeds from the short sale; the 

162      MONEY MACHINE
brokerage firm holds on to it and earns some interest for itself. Not 
only that, brokers require short sellers to put up margin, perhaps 50 
percent, and then charge interest on the remaining fraction. Short 
sellers pay in-and-out commissions, lose the interest they could be 
earning on their margin, pay interest on the rest, and pay dividends 
on the underlying stock—seemingly expensive penalties for being a 
pessimist.
I’ve never sold stock short.
CHURNING IS DANGEROUS TO YOUR WEALTH
When first starting out, brokers try to build a client base by making 
cold calls to people who have been identified as potential customers, 
often as a result of advertisements offering free, no-obligation finan-
cial reports. Those who respond to the ad receive follow-up phone 
calls from brokers hoping to find customers. These cold calls are 
called “dialing for dollars” because the only way a broker can make 
money is by clients making trades.
Brokers have a persuasive incentive to recommend active portfo-
lio management (“account upgrading” is the euphemism, churning 
the goal)—sell Wells Fargo to buy Chase; then sell Chase to buy 
Bank of America; then sell Bank of America to buy Wells Fargo; and 
on and on. Brokers are like sharks—they need movement to survive.
Most brokers are conscientious professionals who know that ex-
cessive expenses and dismal performance will alienate customers. As 
with any profession, however, some brokers are unscrupulous and, 
like vicious sharks, churn their clients’ accounts mercilessly.
A front-page story in the Los Angeles Times that detailed some 
stockbroker abuses was subtitled “Beware, Unwary.” In one case, a 
seventy-year-old retired radio actress saw her $550,000 nest egg 
shrink to $67,000 while thousands of pointless trades generated 
$310,000 in commissions. When she asked her broker about the 
blizzard of trade confirmation slips mailed to her, she says he told 

KISS      163
her to “throw them away.” This is like this old joke: “How do you 
make a small fortune in the stock market? Start with a large ­fortune.”
Most broker-client relationships are not horror stories, but the 
nightmares do warn that broker and customer objectives do not al-
ways coincide.
I avoid brokers by using online brokerage firms.
TRADING COSTS
Brokerage fees are either a percentage or a flat fee, or a combination 
of the two. For small trades, the commission can be staggering; for 
example, most brokerage firms have a minimum commission of, say, 
$9.99 even if you just buy one share of a $5 stock. As a percentage of 
the cost, brokerage fees drop for larger trades, but these savings may 
be offset by the effect of the transaction on the market price since it 
may take a significant price increase to find a seller and a substantial 
decrease to find a buyer. If you sell one stock to buy another, you 
have to pay two transaction costs. At, say, one percent round-trip, 
active trading becomes pretty expensive. Trading once a year, the 
stock you buy has to have a 2 percent higher annual return than the 
stock you sell to cover the cost of the trade. This differential rises to 
24 percentage points if you trade every month. Please don’t trade 
every month and, God forbid, don’t day-trade.
DEFERRING GAINS AND  
HARVESTING LOSSES
It is generally a bad idea to jump in and out of stocks—sell Apple to 
buy Google; then sell Google to buy Amazon; then sell Amazon to 
buy Apple; and on and on. One problem is the endless brokerage 
costs. Another is the taxes that must be paid on capital gains. If you 
own stocks, bonds, or other assets that have increased in value, 

164      MONEY MACHINE
these capital gains are taxable, but you don’t pay the tax until you re-
alize the gain by selling the asset. If, for instance, you buy 1,000 
shares of stock for $20 a share and it rises to $30, you do not have to 
pay a tax on the $10,000 capital gain unless you sell. All realized cap-
ital gains are taxable, and up to $3,000 ($1,500 if married, filing sep-
arately) of realized losses can be used to reduce taxable income. 
Another wrinkle is that the capital gains tax rate is lower on long-
term holdings (more than a year). The exact tax depends on multiple 
comparisons of short-term and long-term gains and losses, but we 
don’t need to go into those details here.
DEFERRING GAINS
The lower tax rate on long-term gains provides an obvious incentive 
to defer the realization of gains, at least until they become lightly 
taxed long-term gains. Even after a year, there are persistent bene-
fits from postponing taxes in order to continue earning dividends 
and capital gains on the deferred taxes.
In our example, suppose that you realize your $10,000 gain by 
selling. If it is a short-term capital gain and you are in a 28 percent 
tax bracket, you must pay the government $2,800, leaving only 
$17,200 to put back in the market. If you don’t sell, you can continue 
earning dividends and capital gains on the full $20,000. In essence, 
the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has loaned you your $2,800 tax 
liability, and the only “interest” you pay on this loan is taxes on the 
extra dividends and capital gains. Even better, there is no capital 
gains tax at all if the stock is held until your death, since your heirs 
do not pay taxes on capital gains that occurred before they receive 
their inheritance. No bank will loan you money at such favorable 
terms.
Table 11-1 shows some illustrative calculations for a portfolio of 
ten stocks that is initially worth $100,000. Every year for thirty 
years, the portfolio earns 5 percent dividends and 5 percent capital 

KISS      165
gains, a total return of 10 percent. The buy-and-hold strategy is to 
never sell, so the only taxes paid are 15 percent taxes on the divi-
dends. The “annual trader” strategy is to turn the portfolio over 
every year, holding each year’s portfolio just long enough to qualify 
for a long-term capital gains tax of 15 percent. The “active trader” 
strategy is to turn the portfolio over four times a year, with the cap-
ital gains taxed at a 28 percent rate.
One set of calculations assumes a $10 commission on each trans-
action; the other calculations assume no trading commissions in 
order to focus on the benefits of postponing capital gains taxes.
Turnover deflates performance dramatically, which illustrates 
the old saying, “The broker made money, the IRS made money, and 
two out of three ain’t bad!” In the short run, the advantage of a 
buy-and-hold strategy is due mostly to the avoidance of brokerage 
fees; in the long run, the postponement of capital gains taxes be-
comes more important.

HARVESTING LOSSES
One persuasive reason for selling a stock is to realize capital losses 
and get a tax credit. You can’t make money by losing money; but 
once a loss has occurred, it can be profitable to realize the loss so 
that the tax credit can be invested. Suppose that the value of the 

166      MONEY MACHINE
1,000 shares you bought for $20,000 falls to $15,000. If you realize 
your $5,000 loss by selling, you can deduct $3,000 from your cur-
rent taxable income and carry forward $2,000 to be deducted from 
future income. In a 28 percent bracket, your $3,000 loss reduces 
your taxes by $840, which you can invest. Instead of having $15,000 
invested, you will have $15,840 earning dividends and (you hope) 
capital gains.
A strategy of deferring gains and harvesting losses is very simple 
and appealing, effectively $100 bills from the IRS.
Every fall, I look at my portfolio to see if any prices are substan-
tially lower than the prices I paid and, if so, I consider reaping the 
tax benefits from realizing capital losses.
TRACKING YOUR PERFORMANCE
Sixteen women in Beardstown, Illinois (population 5,766), got to-
gether in 1983 to form an investment club that they called the Beard-
stown Business and Professional Women’s Investment Club. It was 
an irresistible story. They were grandmotherly (age 70) and got to-
gether to trade recipes, gossip, and stock tips. They reported an an-
nual return of 23.4 percent for their first ten years, 10 percentage 
points better than the 14.9 percent annual return on the S&P 500.
They appeared on television and wrote a charming book called 
Beardstown Ladies’ Common-Sense Investment Guide that included reci-
pes for cooking food and picking stocks. It was a bestseller, so they 
wrote four more books, repackaging their recipes and common-
sense advice.
It turns out they calculated their 23.4 percent return by compar-
ing the size of their portfolio in 1994 to its initial value in 1983, not 
accounting for the monthly dues that had been put into the portfo-
lio along the way. A large part of the reason that their portfolio was 
growing was that they kept putting in more money.
Professional accountants were brought in to straighten things 

KISS      167
out and they concluded that the actual annual rate of return on their 
stocks was only 9.1 percent, 5 percentage points below the S&P 500.
Being America, this revelation led to a class-action lawsuit against 
the book’s publisher that was settled with the lawyers getting cash 
and the wronged customers being allowed to swap their Beardstown 
books for other books, such as 116 Ways to Spoil Your Dog.
I sympathize with the Beardstown ladies because it takes a lot of 
work to do a correct accounting that includes all the money going 
into and out of a portfolio. Money going in from regular and irregu-
lar savings, money going out to pay for cars, colleges, and vacations. 
Portfolios being split during divorces and enlarged during marriages. 
Taxes being paid on realized capital gains and being saved on real-
ized capital losses. Before writing this book, I considered digging 
through my records and figuring out how well I had done. I had a 
general idea that I had done well, but maybe I was being fooled by 
selective recall. I spent about an hour combing through old broker-
age statements before I decided it wasn’t worth the many more 
hours that would be required. For example, every year that I had re-
alized capital gains or losses, I would have to redo my state and fed-
eral tax returns, taking the alternative minimum tax into account, in 
order to determine how much I paid or saved in taxes because of my 
gains and losses.
Then I remembered that I had started a self-directed retirement 
plan back in 1987. I found the initial documents and saw that I had 
put in $26,334. (The odd number reflected the rules for establishing 
such plans.) I never put another penny into this plan and I never 
took a penny out, so whatever this plan was currently worth was an 
accurate tabulation of how well the portfolio had done. The current 
market value was $1,812,639, which works out to be a 15.4 percent 
annual rate of return. The return on the S&P 500 over this period 
was 10.3 percent. If I had bought an S&P 500 index fund, with no 
expenses, my $26,334 would have grown to $481,726. The extra 5 per-
centage points over almost thirty years compounded to a portfolio 
nearly four times as large!

168      MONEY MACHINE
I hadn’t bought any winning lottery tickets. I made a few con-
trarian investments, and I got out of the market during the dot-com 
bubble and got back in after the bubble popped. Mostly, I just 
bought first-rate companies at attractive prices relative to their div-
idends and/or earnings: Apple, Coca-Cola, GE, IBM, Johnson & 
Johnson, Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Costco, JP Morgan, Wells 
Fargo, and some closed-end funds (more on that later in Chapter 14).
My investment strategy has been similar in my other accounts, so 
I imagine that the results have been comparable; in fact, many of 
the stocks are the same. My returns in my nonretirement accounts 
may even be somewhat higher because they benefited from tax-­
harvesting losses on occasional clunkers.

TIMING THE MARKET
Wall Street is having a sale.
—Anonymous 
I
f the alternative is indexing, then the question of timing stock 
purchases and sales is mostly a question of whether being out of 
the market is better than being in the market. Add in the presump-
tion that stocks, on average, do better than Treasury bonds, and we 
should be pretty confident that stocks are overpriced before exiting 
the stock market.
Jumping in and out of the market weekly, daily, or even more fre-
quently is undoubtedly a mistake. Short-term movements in stock 
prices are just too hard to predict. However, there are bubbly times 
when stocks are clearly overpriced and the prudent course is to wait 
out the bubble, and there are panicky times when the prudent 
course is to buy stocks at bargain prices.
Some signs of a bubble are anecdotal. When barbershop patrons 
think stocks can’t fail. When people take out second mortgages to 
buy stocks. When investors measure a company’s success by how 
much money it spends.
In 2000, I went to Bill’s Barbershop in Dennis, Massachusetts, 
and heard people talking about stocks that were sure to double or 
triple in weeks, if not days.
In 2000, a relative told me that he was taking out a second mort-
gage to buy Qualcomm because it had great patents; when I asked 

170      MONEY MACHINE
him about Qualcomm’s dividends and earnings, he didn’t know and 
didn’t care. I didn’t really know or care, either. What was interesting 
to me was that he was going all in on a company with a great story, 
and he didn’t know or care about anything beyond the great story. 
He evidently believed that no price is too high to pay for a stock 
with a great story.
In 2000, a friend told me that he had started a dot-com company, 
sold it for millions, and promptly started another—which he planned 
to sell as soon as possible. He had no interest in running compa-
nies—it was boring paying people to make things that customers 
wanted. His plan was to get rich fast by creating companies that in-
vestors wanted. Start it. Sell it. Move on. I asked him about his new 
company’s profits and he said profits didn’t matter. What mattered 
was his burn rate—how fast he could spend the money given him by 
venture capitalists. I thought he was joking. He wasn’t.
In 2000, a friend who was a VP at a dot-com company told me 
about hits, the number of files downloaded from servers, including 
web pages, images, and JavaScript. Investors evidently thought it 
was good if a company had lots of hits. Perhaps they were confus-
ing file requests with web page visits, or maybe they were looking 
for something to justify their stock purchases. Either way, her 
company obliged by cluttering their web pages with images in 
order to pump up their hit numbers. Investors paid real money for 
garbage.
In 2000, the anecdotal signs of a bubble were unmistakable, 
though I also remembered Keynes’s admonition that “the market 
can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.” It is risky 
to short the market—with short sales, options, or futures—but it is 
prudent to wait for sanity to return.
Part I of this book identified several value-investing tools. Let’s 
apply the JBW equation, Shiller model, and Bogle model to three 
scenarios: March 2000 (when I warned of a bubble), December 
2008 (when I urged investors to buy stocks), and August 2016 (the 
most recently available data). All the data were taken from Robert 

Timing the Market      171
Shiller’s Online Data website, a wonderful source of useful facts and 
figures for value investors who want to assess the S&P 500.
THE JBW EQUATION
One investing benchmark is implied by the John Burr Williams 
(JBW) equation:
R
D
P
g
=
+
where R is the total annual return, D is the annual dividend, P is the 
current stock price, and g is the annual rate of growth of dividends. 
We can apply this equation to the overall stock market by calcu-
lating the dividend yield for the S&P 500 and making an assumption 
about the long-run growth of dividends and perhaps the long-run 
growth of the economy. This total return estimate—the dividend 
yield plus the dividend growth rate—can be compared to the inter-
est rate on long-term Treasury bonds plus whatever risk premium 
seems appropriate.
Table 12-1 compares the JBW valuations for the S&P 500 in 
March 2000, December 2008, and August 2016. In March 2000, 
the S&P 500 dividend yield was 1.16 percent. Adding in a 5 percent 
long-run growth rate for dividends, the predicted total return is 
6.16 percent:
R = 1.16% + 5% = 6.16%
This was lower than the 6.26 percent return on ten-year Treasury 
bonds, indicating that stocks were not an attractive long-term in-
vestment. Earning less than Treasury bonds with a lot more risk is 
not appealing.
In December 2008, in contrast, the S&P 500 dividend yield was 
3.23 percent, and a 5 percent long-run growth rate gives an 8.23 pre-
dicted total return. 

172      MONEY MACHINE
R = 3.23% + 5% = 8.23%
This was 5.81 percentage points above the 2.42 percent return on 
ten-year Treasury bonds, indicating that stocks were an attractive 
long-term investment for all but the extremely risk-averse. Making 
5.81 percent more per year, multiplied by the miracle of compound 
interest, is irresistible. If these return projections turned out to be 
correct, $100,000 in Treasury bonds would grow to $127,000 in ten 
years, while $100,000 in stocks would grow to $221,000.
As for the most recent data available at the time of this writing, 
August 2016, the S&P 500 dividend yield was 2.13 percent, and a 5 
percent long-run growth rate gives a 7.13 predicted total return. 
R = 2.13% + 5% = 7.13%
That’s 5.32 percentage points above the 1.81 percent return on ten-
year Treasury bonds, again indicating that stocks are an attractive 
long-term investment.

SHILLER’S CYCLICALLY ADJUSTED 
EARNINGS YIELD
Robert Shiller calculates a cyclically adjusted P/E ratio (CAPE) by 
dividing the inflation-adjusted value of the S&P 500 by cyclically 
adjusted earnings (the average value of the inflation-adjusted earn-
ings over the preceding ten years). For a value-investing bench-

Timing the Market      173
mark, I noted previously (in Chapter 7) that we can calculate the 
cyclically adjusted earnings yield (CAEP) by taking the inverse of 
CAPE. The earnings yield is a rough estimate of the real rate of re-
turn on stocks, so we can compare this number to the real interest 
rate on ten-year Treasury bonds and see whether stocks or bonds 
look more attractive.
Table 12-2 shows the calculations, using an assumed 2.5 percent 
rate of inflation, the average over this period. In March 2000, the 
earnings yield (CAEP) was 2.31 percent, which was 1.45 percentage 
points lower than the real Treasury rate, indicating that stocks were 
an unappealing investment. In December 2008 and (to a lesser ex-
tent) in August 2016, the earnings yield was well above the Treasury 
rate, indicating that stocks were an attractive investment.

BOGLE’S TEN-YEAR HORIZON
John Bogle’s model for estimating stock returns over a ten-year 
­horizon is
stock return = dividend yield + annual growth of earnings + annual change in P/E
I can use the Bogle equation to assess the attractiveness of stocks 
in March 2000 and in August 2016, but there is a complication for 
December 2008. Earnings had fallen by more than 80 percent from 

174      MONEY MACHINE
a year earlier because of the severe economic recession. Stock prices 
only fell 40 percent because investors anticipated that the recession 
would be temporary. The price-earnings ratio consequently tripled, 
from 18 to 59—not because stock prices had risen, but because stock 
prices had not fallen as much as earnings. To use the Bogle equation, 
I would need to forecast a surge in earnings as the recession ended 
and a drop in the P/E ratio as earnings surged. It is doable, but more 
complex than the other calculations in this book, so I will not use 
the Bogle equation for December 2008.
Table 12-3 shows the Bogle calculations for March 2000, using 
the 1.3 percent dividend yield for the S&P 500 and assuming a 5 per-
cent annual growth in earnings. The price-earnings ratio was 28.3 in 
March 2000, and I considered four different scenarios for the price-
earnings ratio ten years ahead, in 2010. Unless investors expected a 
substantial increase in the price-earnings ratio for the S&P 500, 
stocks were not an attractive investment.

substantially, stocks look like a good investment.

These three models come to the same conclusion. Stocks were too 
expensive for value investors in March 2000, so it was a good time 
to be out of the market (and I said so at the time). Stocks were 
cheap in December 2008, so it was a great time to be in the market 
(and I said so at the time). Stocks were inexpensive in August 2016, 
so it was a good time to be in the market (and I am saying so at this 
time). I don’t know what will happen to stock prices over the next 
few months or years, but ten years from now, in 2026, I expect value 
investors who were fully invested in August 2016 to be pleased with 
the results.

PICKING STOCKS
It is a difference of opinion that makes horse races.
—Mark Twain
T
he value-investing philosophy is simple: Look for great compa-
nies whose stocks are inexpensive relative to their dividends 
and earnings. It is pretty much the same philosophy held by John Burr 
Williams, Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffett, and other value inves-
tors—great companies at a fair price. Buffett has two advantages over 
us ordinary value investors. First, his reputation gives him sweetheart 
deals. Companies that want a public-relations stamp of approval sell 
stock to Buffett at bargain prices that aren’t available to the rest of us. 
Second, his insurance companies give him enormous leverage. When 
people buy insurance, their premiums plus whatever the company 
earns by investing the premiums are used to pay off claims for car in-
surance, home insurance, life insurance, and so on. Insurance compa-
nies set their premiums based on an assumption that they will earn 
modest returns—for example, Treasury rates—when they invest the 
premiums. Buffett’s insurance companies set premiums comparable 
to those set by other insurance companies, but then invest the premi-
ums in stocks that, on average, do a lot better than Treasury bonds. In 
essence, Buffett borrows money from policyholders at Treasury rates 
(currently around 2 percent) and invests the premiums in stocks giv-
ing double-digit returns. You and I can’t borrow money at Treasury 
rates. But we can still be value investors.

Picking Stocks      177
The starting point is to identify great companies, then to decide 
whether their stocks are attractively priced. Let’s apply the JBW, 
Shiller, and Bogle valuation measures to the three top companies in 
Fortune’s 2016 list of most admired stocks: Apple, Google, and 
­Amazon.
APPLE
When I was a graduate student during the years 1969–1971, Yale’s 
computer center was a brick building that had been home to an in-
surance company. There was a behemoth of a computer inside an 
air-conditioned and dust-controlled room. The rest of the building 
was row after row of keypunch machines that were used to prepare 
IBM punch cards. Students and professors sat at the keypunch ma-
chines, which were much like typewriters, and typed in data and 
software code, with each keystroke punching a hole in a card. Each 
card represented one line of instructions, so a complete program 
might fill several cardboard boxes, each holding 2,000 cards.
Computer users handed their boxes of cards to machine opera-
tors through a set of sliding glass windows, and the operators fed the 
cards into the giant computer. Users then waited for their output, 
which might take hours. If there were errors, users sifted through 
their cards looking for a mistake, corrected it, resubmitted their 
cards, and waited for the next round of output.
The never-ending click-clacking of the keypunch machines was 
awful, as were the long waits and treasure hunts for errors, but it was 
state of the art at the time. It was also stressful, and sometimes the 
stress got out of hand. One of my fellow PhD students, “Jack,” had 
worked for nearly a year trying to debug the program he needed to 
finish his thesis. One day, when he handed his two boxes of punch 
cards through the window to the machine operator, the operator 
turned to load the cards into the card feeder, but tripped and spilled 
thousands of cards on the floor. Jack jumped through window and 

178      MONEY MACHINE
tried to choke the operator. Two other people pulled Jack away and 
explained that it was a prank. They had distracted Jack and swapped 
his boxes for two boxes of surplus cards, which the operator pro-
ceeded to drop and scatter. Jack was relieved, but not amused.
When I came to Pomona College in 1981, the college was using 
dumb terminals (keyboards and display monitors) scattered around 
campus and connected to the college’s IBM mainframe. Dumb ter-
minals were a big step up from punch cards, since the results came 
back quickly and the terminals were quiet!
However, the entire system was under the control of the com-
puter center. The computer center decided what programs to put on 
the mainframe and they selected a relatively small number of pro-
grams that were easy for them to maintain. Users had few options.
Then came the personal computer revolution, so called be-
cause—unlike a dumb terminal—a personal computer has a built-in 
CPU and does not need to be connected to a mainframe. Users can 
choose the software they want, including software they have written 
themselves.
Pomona College’s computer center resisted the revolution be-
cause it was easier for them to maintain a small set of programs on a 
mainframe. As a user, it was clear to me that the personal computer 
revolution might be delayed, but it would not be stopped. My wife 
and I gave our first son an Apple II for his ninth birthday. When he 
opened the box, I took the instructions and he took the computer. 
He had it up and running before I finished reading the instructions.
Legendary mutual fund manager Peter Lynch said that some of 
his biggest winners came from going to a mall with his daughters, 
giving them some money, and seeing where they spent it. He argued, 
“If you like the store, chances are you’ll love the stock.” His shop-
ping strategy might be justified by the argument that new stores fly 
under Wall Street’s radar. However, in lesser hands, his philosophy 
can lead investors to make the classic mistake of buying a stock be-
cause the company is great, not because the stock is cheap.
This was one of my (few) Peter Lynch moments. I knew that users 

Picking Stocks      179
wanted personal computers, not dumb terminals, and I saw firsthand 
how easy the Apple II was to use. Apple stock didn’t pay dividends 
and its earnings were dodgy, but I bought some stock anyway. I also 
bought my son Apple stock for his high school graduation present. In 
retrospect, I was lucky. Commodore, Kaypro, Tandy, and dozens of 
other PC makers did not survive. Apple was sometimes near-death.
Apple has evolved into a mature company that derives most of its 
revenue from its iPhones, which, like the Macintosh and Apple II, 
were revolutionary. Apple still makes computers, of course, and has 
a solid Apple-ecosystem that is used by millions of Apple fans. Apple 
is now a money machine that can be assessed by value investors.
Let’s value Apple today (August 2016) using the same three valu-
ation methods we used to value the S&P 500 in Chapter 12: the JBW 
equation, Shiller’s cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio (CAPE), 
and the Bogle model.
The John Burr Williams (JBW) equation is
R
D
P
g
=
+
where R is the total annual return, D is the annual dividend, P is the 
current stock price, and g is the annual rate of growth of dividends.
For Apple stock in August 2016, the annual dividend was $2.28 
per share and the stock price was around $100, giving a dividend 
yield of 2.28 percent:
D
P
$2.28
$100.00
0.0228 (2.28 percent)
=
=
In my assessment of the S&P 500, I assumed a 5 percent growth 
rate of dividends, roughly the long-run growth rate of dividends and 
the U.S. economy. Using that 5 percent growth rate here implies a 
7.28 percent total return, which (as Table 13-1 shows) is 5.47 percent-
age points above the ten-year Treasury rate.
At the time, Apple’s 2.28 percent dividend yield was slightly 
higher than that for the S&P 500, making it a slightly more ­attractive 

180      MONEY MACHINE
stock if we use the same 5 percent dividend growth rate for Apple 
and the S&P 500. This seems extremely conservative. Apple’s divi-
dends had increased by 10 percent a year since Apple instituted a 
dividend in 2012 and Apple’s earnings per share had increased at a 55 
percent annual rate over the past ten years and at a 41 percent an-
nual rate over the previous five years.
Many feared that Apple was no longer a premier growth stock, 
that it was now just a mature money machine. It certainly gets 
harder to maintain a crazy growth rate as a company gets larger; but, 
even so, it was hard to imagine that Apple would grow more slowly 
than the average company in the S&P 500 over the next ten years. 
Plus, there is nothing inherently bad about being a mature money 
machine. In fact, it may be a safer investment than a young start-up 
with nothing more than hoped-for profits in the future.
Apple had been No. 1 in the annual Forbes ratings of the most 
admired companies for nine years running, 2008 through 2016. A 
sudden collapse seemed unlikely.
Apple’s earnings certainly wouldn’t grow by 40 or 50 percent for-
ever, nor would its dividends grow by 10 percent forever, but a 5 per-
cent growth rate for dividends was surely conservative.

I also made a more complicated calculation of the present value of 
Apple’s dividends, assuming that Apple’s dividends grow at 10 per-
cent a year for twenty years, then drop to a 5 percent growth rate, 
roughly the projected long-run growth rate of the economy.
We can calculate the present value of these projected dividends 
for any assumed required return. This is the intrinsic value of Apple 

Picking Stocks      181
stock. It turns out that if we discount the projected dividends by a 
9.54 percent required return, the intrinsic value is $100.
Here are the implications:
1.	 Investors who would be happy with a 9.54 percent annual 
rate of return should be happy owning Apple stock.
2.	 If dividends grow more than assumed in these calculations, 
the return is even larger.
3.	 If dividends grow less than anticipated, the return is smaller; 
for example, if Apple’s dividend growth rate drops to 5 per-
cent after ten years, the return is 8.41 percent; if it falls to 5 
percent immediately, the return is 7.28 percent.
This all makes sense. A 2.28 percent dividend yield gives a 7.28 per-
cent return if dividends grow by 5 percent a year forever and a 12.28 
percent return if dividends grow by 10 percent a year forever. If the 
dividend growth rate is 10 percent for a while and then drops to 5 
percent, the return will be between 7.28 percent and 12.28 percent, 
and the return will be higher the longer the 10 percent growth rate 
is maintained.
Are these calculations dependent on the heroic assumption that 
Apple will be around forever? Not really. The heavy discounting of 
distant dividends makes them essentially meaningless.
Figure 13-1 shows the cumulative intrinsic value of Apple’s divi-
dends, using a 9.54 percent required return. For example, the cumu-
lative value over a twenty-year horizon is the present value of the 
first twenty years of dividends. As shown, almost all of Apple’s in-
trinsic value comes from the first 100 years. If Apple were to disap-
pear 100 years from now, it would have essentially no effect on 
Apple’s current intrinsic value.
(Nonetheless, it is good to use a model that assumes an infinite ho-
rizon, because it keeps us from guessing about what the price of Apple 
stock will be tomorrow or a year from now. The infinite-horizon model 
makes no assumptions about the future price of Apple stock.)

182      MONEY MACHINE
FIGURE 13-1. Cumulative intrinsic value of Apple
Now let’s try Shiller’s model. The cyclically adjusted P/E ratio 
(CAPE) can be misleading for individual companies that have been 
growing very rapidly. Figure 13-2 shows that Apple’s earnings per 
share (in 2016 dollars) increased from $0.38 per share in 2006 to 
$9.22 per share in 2015, a 43 percent annual rate of increase. Because 
of Apple’s rapid growth, the $3.73 average over this ten-year period 
greatly understates Apple’s current and projected future earnings.

Figure 13-3 shows the S&P 500’s inflation-adjusted earnings. Here, 
the fluctuations around the average are more important than the 
growth in earnings over time, and it makes sense to calculate a ten-
year average in order to smooth out these fluctuations and give a 
more accurate representation of earnings than would be provided by 
any single year. For Apple, in contrast, the growth over time is more 
important than the year-to-year fluctuations, and the ten-year aver-
age is a misleading representation of Apple’s earnings.
FIGURE 13-3. S&P 500 inflation-adjusted earnings per share
Nonetheless, I calculated the cyclically adjusted earnings yield 
(CAEP) by dividing Apple’s average inflation-adjusted earnings by 
the inflation-adjusted price of Apple stock ($100):
Since the earnings yield is a rough estimate of the real rate of re-
turn on stocks, I compared CAEP to the real interest rate on ten-
year Treasury bonds.

Table 13-2 shows the calculations, using an assumed 2.5 percent 
rate of inflation, the average over the past several years. Apple was 
slightly less attractive than the overall S&P 500, but there was still a 
4.42 percentage-point difference between the Apple’s cyclically ad-
justed earnings yield and the real return on ten-year Treasury bonds. 
Taking into account the conservative $3.73 number for Apple’s earn-
ings, Apple becomes more attractive.

This, too, makes sense. With Apple stock at $100 a share, a cycli-
cally adjusted earnings figure of $3.73 gives an earnings yield of 3.73 
percent, which is an estimate of the real return on Apple stock.
Cyclically adjusted earnings are intended to adjust for the ups 
and downs in business cycles. Movements in Apple’s earnings during 
the years 2006 through 2015 were not due to a business cycle, but to 
Apple’s growth. Its 2015 earnings of $9.22 don’t really need be ad-
justed much for the business cycle, so it is reasonable to use an earn-
ings figure that is closer to $9.22 than $3.73, which gives a projected 
real return substantially higher than the already attractive 3.73 
­percent.
One way to adjust a growth company’s earnings for the business 
cycle is to fit a line to the earnings data, as in Figure 13-4. The fitted 
line smooths out the year-to-year fluctuations, as intended, but al-
lows for growth. By this reckoning, Apple’s 2015 cyclically adjusted 
earnings were $8.18, giving a CAEP of 8.18 percent, more than dou-
ble the value using the ten-year average earnings of $3.73:

This projected real return of 8.18 percent is 8.87 percent higher

FIGURE 13-4. A regression line fit to Apple’s earnings.
Let’s now look at John Bogle’s model for estimating stock returns 
over a ten-year horizon:
stock
return = dividend
yield
+ annual growth
of earnings
+ annual change
in P/E
Apple’s price-earnings ratio was 12 in August 2016, half that of 
the S&P 500. Table 13-3 shows the returns predicted by the Bogle 
model for the assumption that the price-earnings ratios in 2026 are 
still 12 for Apple and 24 for the S&P 500, and that both earnings 
grow at 5 percent annually. If the price-earnings ratio is constant and 
earnings are projected to grow at the same rate as dividends, Bogle’s 
model and the JBW equation give the same total return values. Table

13-3 also shows the total returns if Apple’s earnings grow at 10 per-
cent annually for the next ten years, and if Apple and the S&P 500 
both have a P/E of 20 in 2026. Since Apple’s P/E would be going up 
and the S&P 500 P/E would be going down, this enhances Apple’s 
return and diminishes the S&P 500 return.

As with the JBW and Shiller metrics, the Bogle model’s implications 
make sense. In 2016, Apple had a dividend yield of 2.28 percent. If 
its dividends and earnings were to grow at 5 percent a year for ten 
years, and its P/E stays at 12, it will give investors a 7.28 percent re-
turn over this ten-year horizon. If Apple’s earnings and dividends 
grow by more than 5 percent a year over the next ten years and/or its 
P/E is higher than 12 in 2026, the rate of return on Apple stock will 
be higher than 7.28 percent—perhaps much higher.
Table 13-4 summarizes the calculations for these three models. I 
concluded that the S&P 500 was an attractive investment and that 
Apple was even more so. In August 2016, I held an imprudently large 
fraction of my portfolio in Apple stock.

In January 1994, just as the World Wide Web (WWW) was starting 
to get traction, two Stanford graduate students, Jerry Yang and 
David Filo, started a website. “Jerry and David’s Guide to the World 
Wide Web” was a list of what they considered interesting web pages. 
A year later, they incorporated the company with the sexy name 
Yahoo. By now, they had a catalog of 10,000 sites and 100,000 
Yahoo users a day, fueled by the fact that the popular Netscape 
browser had a Directory button that sent people to Yahoo.com.

As the Web took off, Yahoo hired hundreds of people to search 
for sites to add to its exponentially growing directory. They added 
graphics, news stories, and advertisements. By 1996, Yahoo had 
more than 10 million visitors a day. Yahoo thought of itself as a 
media company, sort of like Fortune magazine, where people came to 
be informed and entertained and advertisers paid for a chance to 
catch readers’ wandering eyes. Yahoo hired its own writers to create 
unique content. As Yahoo added more content, such as sports and 
finance pages, it attracted targeted advertising—directed at people 
who are interested in sports or finance. Yahoo started Yahoo Mail, 
Yahoo Shopping, and other bolt-ons.
Then came Google in 1998 with its revolutionary search algo-
rithm. Yahoo couldn’t manually keep up with the growth of the 
Web, so it used Google’s search engine for four years while it devel-
oped a competing algorithm. Meanwhile, Google established itself 
as the go-to search site and maintained a 90 percent worldwide 
share of the search market in 2016.
Larry Page graduated from the University of Michigan; Sergey 
Brin was born in Moscow and graduated from the University of 
Maryland. Both dropped out of Stanford’s PhD program in com-
puter science to start Google. Their initial insight was that a web 
page’s importance could be gauged by the number of links to the 
page, so they created a powerful web crawler that could roam the 
Web counting links. This search algorithm, called PageRank, has 
morphed into other, more sophisticated algorithms, allowing Google 
to stay ahead of the pack of other search engines.
Google’s ad revenue has generated an enormous cash flow, which 
it invests in other projects, including Google Chrome (which has 
displaced Microsoft’s Internet Explorer as the most used browser); 
Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides (which threaten 
Microsoft Office), and of course, Google cars.
In 2015, I was invited to Science Foo Camp (“Sci Foo”) organized 
by O’Reilly Media, Digital Science, and Google. (“Foo” stands for 
Friends of O’Reilly.) Sci Foo brings together about 250 invited 

Picking Stocks      189
­academic, business, and government “thought leaders” for a week-
end of conversation about science and technology. It is all-expenses-
paid and held at the Googleplex, Google’s corporate headquarters in 
Mountain View, California. I had never been to the Googleplex and 
free was hard to resist, so I said yes, even though I wasn’t sure why 
they invited me. I had just written a book titled Standard Deviations: 
Flawed Assumptions, Tortured Data, and Other Ways to Lie with Statistics, 
which advised caution and skepticism when analyzing big data—
Google’s forte.
While I was at Sci Foo, I facilitated a session on regression to the 
mean and gave a five-minute lightning talk on the perils of mining 
big data for gold. Afterward, I wrote a blog that (roughly) replicated 
my talk. Here is an excerpt: 
Big Data, Big Computers, Big Trouble
Many years ago, James Tobin, a Nobel laureate in economics, 
wryly observed that the bad old days when researchers had to do cal-
culations by hand were actually a blessing. In today’s language, it was 
a feature, not a flaw. The calculations were so hard that people thought 
hard before they calculated. Today, with terabytes of data and light-
ning-fast computers, it is too easy to calculate first, think later.
Over and over, we are told that government, business, finance, 
medicine, law, and our daily lives are being revolutionized by a new-
found ability to sift through reams of data and discover the truth. We 
can make wise decisions because powerful computers have scruti-
nized the data and seen the light.
Maybe. Or maybe not.
Two endemic problems are nicely summarized by the Texas Sharp-
shooter Fallacy. In one version, a self-proclaimed marksman com-
pletely covers a wall with targets, and then fires his gun. Inevitably, he 
hits a target, which he proudly displays without mentioning all the 
missed targets. Because he was certain to hit a target, the fact that 
he did so proves nothing at all. In research, this corresponds to test-
ing hundreds of theories and reporting the most statistically signifi-
cant result, without mentioning all the failed tests. This, too, proves 
nothing because one is certain to find a statistically persuasive result 
if one does enough tests.
In the second version of the sharpshooter fallacy, the hapless 
cowboy shoots a bullet at a blank wall. He then draws a bull’s-eye 

190      MONEY MACHINE
around the bullet hole, which again proves nothing at all because 
there will always be a hole to draw a circle around. The research equiv-
alent is to ransack data for a pattern and, after one is found, think up 
a theory.
A concise summary is the cynical comment of Ronald Coase, an-
other economics Nobel laureate: “If you torture the data long enough, 
it will confess.”
Do serious researchers really torture data? Far too often. It’s how 
well-respected people came up with the now-discredited ideas that 
coffee causes pancreatic cancer and people can be healed by posi-
tive energy from self-proclaimed healers living thousands of miles 
away.
An example of the first sharpshooter fallacy is a study provoca-
tively titled “The Hound of the Baskervilles Effect,” referring to Sir Ar-
thur Conan Doyle’s story in which Charles Baskerville dies of a heart 
attack while he is being pursued down a dark alley by a vicious dog:
The dog, incited by its master, sprang over the wicket-gate 
and pursued the unfortunate baronet, who fled screaming 
down the yew alley. In that gloomy tunnel it must indeed have 
been a dreadful sight to see that huge black creature, with 
its flaming jaws and blazing eyes, bounding after its victim. 
He fell dead at the end of the alley from heart disease and 
terror.
The study’s author argued that Japanese and Chinese Americans 
are similarly susceptible to heart attacks on the fourth day of every 
month because in Japanese, Mandarin, and Cantonese, the pronun-
ciation of four and death are very similar.
Four is an unlucky number for many Asian Americans, but are they 
really so superstitious and fearful that the fourth day of the month—
which, after all, happens every month—is as terrifying as being 
chased down a dark alley by a ferocious dog?
The Baskervilles study (isn’t the BS acronym tempting?) examined 
California data for Japanese and Chinese Americans who died of coro-
nary disease. Of those deaths that occurred on the third, fourth, and 
fifth days of the month, 33.9 percent were on day 4, which does not 
differ substantially or statistically from the expected 33.3 percent. 
So, how did the Baskervilles study come to the opposite conclusion? 
There are dozens of categories of heart disease and they only re-
ported results for the five categories in which more than one-third of 
the deaths occurred on day 4. Unsurprisingly, attempts by other re-
searchers to replicate their conclusion failed.

An example of the second sharpshooter fallacy is an investment 
strategy based on the gold-silver ratio (GSR), which is the ratio of the 
price of an ounce of gold to the price of an ounce of silver. . . . [I dis-
cuss the GSR in Chapter 4 of this book.] 
Modern computers can ransack large databases looking for much 
more subtle and complex patterns. But the problem is the same. If 
there is no underlying reason for the discovered pattern, there is no 
reason for deviations from the pattern to self-correct.
These two sharpshooter fallacies are examples of data mining. 
Thirty years ago, calling someone a “data miner” was an insult com-
parable to being accused of plagiarism. Today, people advertise them-
selves as data miners. This is a flaw, not a feature. Big data and big 
computers make it easy to calculate before thinking, but it is better to 
think hard before calculating.
There I was in the Googleplex, the temple of big data, preaching 
skepticism about mining big data. Dozens of people told me after-
ward how much they enjoyed my sermon. Several worked at Google, 
including one guy who told me that my skepticism about big data 
was precisely why I was invited.
I was blown away. Too many companies undermine themselves 
by never questioning their business models. Google paid for me to 
come to the Googleplex and ask hard questions. When I got home, 
I bought Google stock.
Let’s value Google today (August 2016) using the same valuation 
methods we used to value Apple. The dividend-discount model and 
John Burr Williams (JBW) equation cannot be used for stocks that 
do not pay dividends, and Google does not pay dividends, so I 
turned instead to the Shiller and Bogle models.
As I noted in valuing Apple, Shiller’s cyclically adjusted P/E ratio 
(CAPE) can be misleading for companies that have been growing 
very rapidly. Google’s earnings had been increasing at an annual rate 
of 33 percent over the past ten years and 14 percent over the past five 
years, and Figure 13-5 shows that Google’s $14.25 average earnings 
per share during the years 2006 through 2015 surely understates 
Google’s current and projected future earnings. (Google’s earnings 
were $22.84 in 2015 and predicted to be $28.00 in 2016.)

192      MONEY MACHINE
FIGURE 13-5. Google inflation-adjusted earnings per share.
Nonetheless, I calculated Google’s cyclically adjusted earnings yield 
(CAEP) by dividing its average inflation-adjusted earnings by its in-
flation adjusted stock price.

Since this 1.83 percent earnings yield is a rough estimate of a 
stock’s real rate of return, I compared Google’s CAEP to the real in-
terest rate on ten-year Treasury bonds.
Table 13-5 shows the calculations, using an assumed 2.5 percent 
rate of inflation. Google was less attractive than the overall S&P 500 
by this metric, but there was still a 2.50 percentage-point difference 
between the Google’s cyclically adjusted earnings yield and the real 
return on ten-year Treasury bonds.

Taking into account the fact that $14.25 is a conservative number for 
Google’s earnings, its stock becomes more attractive. A line fit to 
Google’s earnings is so close to actual earnings as to be barely distin-
guishable. This fitted line implies 2015 cyclically adjusted earnings of 
$22.73, which increases Google’s CAEP and projected real return to 
2.91 percent, which is 3.60 percent above the projected real return 
on ten-year Treasury bonds.

Now, let’s use John Bogle’s model for estimating Google stock re-
turns over a ten-year horizon:
stock
return = dividend
yield
+ annual growth
of earnings
+ annual change
in P/E
Google’s price-earnings ratio was 28 in August 2016, somewhat 
above the S&P 500 P/E of 24. Table 13-6 shows the returns predicted 
by the Bogle model for the assumption that Google and S&P 500 
earnings grow by 5 percent a year and that the price-earnings ratios 
in ten years (2026) are still 28 for Google and 24 for the S&P 500. 
Table 13-6 also shows the total returns if Google’s earnings grow by 
10 percent a year for the next ten years, and if Google and the S&P 
500 both have a P/E of 20 in 2026. Since both P/Es would be going 
down, this reduces the ten-year annual return on both.

One of the appealing features of the Bogle model is that the calcula-
tions can be done in your head or on the back of an envelope. Google 
does not pay dividends, so the return is solely from the price appre-
ciation over the next ten years. (If Google did pay dividends, we 
would simply add the dividend yield to the annual price ­appreciation.)
Google’s projected price appreciation is due to the projected an-
nual rate of increase in its earnings and the change (if any) in its 
price-earnings ratio. If the P/E is unchanged, then Google’s annual 
price appreciation will be 5 percent, if its earnings grow by 5 per-
cent, and 10 percent if its earnings grow by 10 percent. If Google’s 
P/E goes up or down by, say, one percent a year, the projected return 
goes down or up by the same amount.
Table 13-7 summarizes my calculations for the Shiller and Bogle 
models. I concluded that the case for Google was not as compelling 
as the case for Apple, but I thought Google was more attractive 
than the overall S&P 500 because:
1.	  I expected Google’s earnings to increase by at least 10 per-
cent annually over the next ten years.

Picking Stocks      195
2.	 I thought it was unlikely that Google’s P/E in 2026 would be 
less than that for the S&P 500.
I had a substantial holding of Google stock in August 2016, though 
not nearly as large as my Apple holdings.

AMAZON
I was on sabbatical during the 2015–2016 academic year. As part of 
my transition back to teaching, I decided to get a new briefcase. My 
current briefcase had lasted thirty years and its beaten-down charm 
had morphed into beaten-down raggedy. My wife and children made 
faces, so I searched Amazon, found a briefcase I liked, and ordered 
it. With Amazon Prime, the shipping was fast and free.
When I opened the box, my wife and our four children made 
faces again. I shipped the briefcase back at Amazon’s expense and 
my wife picked out a briefcase she liked. The shipping was fast and 
free, and so was the return when I found out that it was too small. It 

196      MONEY MACHINE
took three more tries before we found a briefcase that everyone 
liked. Yes, the time needed to reach a decision is proportional to the 
square of the number of people involved.
How can Amazon afford free shipping both ways? It can’t. Ama-
zon Prime costs $99 a year and includes free two-day shipping (same-
day delivery in some places), free streaming of movies, television 
shows, music, and ebooks. Most returns are free, too.
Amazon sells more than $100 billion of stuff annually to 250 mil-
lion active users, including more than 50 million Amazon Prime 
members, but it barely makes a profit. Some years, it loses money. It 
lost $241 million in 2014, but bounced back with a $596 million 
profit in 2015. Even the $596 million profit was only a razor-thin 0.55 
percent on its 2015 revenue of $107 billion.
Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos, whose mom was a teenager 
when he was born and whose stepfather was a Cuban refugee. He 
got bachelor of science degrees from Princeton in electrical engi-
neering and computer science. Bright and tireless, he worked on 
Wall Street and then set out to conquer the retail world with Ama-
zon. And conquer it he has.
Scalable technology is technology that allows a business to grow 
with very little incremental cost. If your business model is making 
necklaces by hand, the cost of making the thousandth necklace is 
about the same as the cost of making the first one. If your business 
model is making a downloadable app, the cost of getting the app to 
the thousandth customer is much less than the cost of creating the 
app for the first customer. If your business model is a web page that 
sells advice, the cost of selling advice to the thousandth customer is 
much less than the cost of setting up the page to sell advice to the 
first customer.
Scalability can create a winner-take-all market. If the cost of creat-
ing the product is huge and the cost of selling additional products is 
trivial, the initial cost creates an effective barrier to entry and the small 
cost of selling additional products allows an established firm with lots 
of customers to undercut the prices of new entrants. This is the ratio-

Picking Stocks      197
nale for the commonplace rule in Silicon Valley: “Growth first, revenue 
later.” Big companies scare away competitors and undercut those who 
dare to compete. Once a company is established as the biggest, cheap-
est, and best known, it can collect monopolistic profits.
Amazon’s strategy has been growth first. However, Amazon is no 
longer a start-up. It is a dominant company that should be ready to 
reap the rewards of a monopoly, yet every success seems to fund ever 
more ambitious projects: phones, tablets, one-hour delivery service, 
movies, cloud computing. Amazon is a terrific company, but where 
are the profits?
Amazon does not pay dividends, so, as with Google, I can’t use 
the dividend-discount model and John Burr Williams (JBW) equa-
tion. Instead, I used the Shiller and Bogle models.
Figure 13-6 shows that, unlike Apple and Google, Amazon’s earn-
ings have not been growing rapidly. Indeed, the biggest investor 
complaint about Amazon is that it keeps spending money in order 
to get bigger and do more things—which leaves shareholders wish-
ing that Amazon would use its market domination to earn some 
profits. Amazon’s earnings have fallen by 4 percent a year over the 
past ten years and by 26 percent a year over the past five years.

As with Apple and Google, I calculated Amazon’s cyclically adjusted 
earnings yield (CAEP) and compared it to the real interest rate on 
ten-year Treasury bonds. Table 13-8 shows the calculations, using an 
assumed 2.5 percent rate of inflation. Amazon’s cyclically adjusted 
price-earnings ratio is a mind-boggling 664.5, and its CAEP is a mi-
nuscule 0.15 percent (yep, fifteen-hundreds of one percent). By this 
measure, Amazon is not only less attractive than the S&P 500, its 
projected return is less than that on ten-year Treasury bonds.

Table 13-10 summarizes the calculations for the Shiller and Bogle 
models. I concluded that Amazon was too risky for my tastes. Its P/E 
cannot defy gravity forever. Perhaps Amazon’s earnings will soar, 
which, by itself, will reduce the price-earnings ratio. But an increase 
in earnings with no dividends and the stock price unchanged doesn’t 
give investors anything. Or maybe Amazon’s P/E will fall because 
Amazon’s stock price collapses, which is even worse for ­investors.
I love Amazon, but I don’t like the stock. Its earnings may ex-
plode, but it is too perilous an investment for me.

CLOSED-END FUNDS
Good intelligence is nine-tenths of any battle.
—Napoleon
C
hapter 10 discussed mutual funds and the appeal of index 
funds. Some mutual funds may be even more attractive than 
index funds. To see this, we need to make an important distinction 
between open-end and closed-end funds.
Open-end funds increase or reduce the number of shares out-
standing as more money is invested in the fund or withdrawn from 
the fund. Suppose that a mutual fund with the optimistic name 
­BeatTheMarket has 10 million shares outstanding and owns a port-
folio of stocks worth $100 million. Its net asset value (NAV) per 
share is calculated by dividing the market value of its portfolio by 
the number of shares the fund has issued.

NAV
$100 million

If BeatTheMarket is an open-end fund, it will issue new shares or re-
deem existing shares at a price equal to the fund’s net asset value of 
$10 a share. If investors buy a million shares at $10 apiece, the num-
ber of shares will go up to 11 million and the fund’s assets will in-
crease to $110 million, leaving its NAV at $10/share:

If, instead, investors were to redeem a million shares at $10 apiece, 
the number of shares would go down to 9 million and the fund’s as-
sets would fall to $90 million, again leaving its NAV at $10/share:

Fair’s fair. Investors deal directly with the fund and their decisions 
to come or go are at a fair price, with no effect on the other 
­shareholders.
CLOSED-END FUNDS
If BeatTheMarket is a closed-end fund, instead of an open-end fund, 
it issues a fixed number of shares—say, 10 million shares when it is 
created—and, once established, does not issue new shares or re-
deem old ones. Investors cannot buy new shares from the fund or 
sell their shares back to the fund. Instead, closed-end shares are 
traded on stock exchanges, where investors buy shares from existing 
shareholders or sell their shares to someone else—the same way that 
they buy or sell shares of GE and IBM.
IBM’s stock price need not equal its book value; in fact, it is sel-
dom, if ever, equal to its book value. IBM’s stock price is whatever 
is needed to maintain a balance between people wanting to buy IBM 
stock and people wanting to sell. It is the same with closed-end 
funds. The market price of a closed-end fund need not be, and sel-
dom is, equal to its net asset value.
Closed-end funds typically trade at a discount from net asset 
value, though some trade at premiums. The discounts ebb and flow, 

202      MONEY MACHINE
increasing when small investors leave the stock market and shrink-
ing when they return. Before the Great Crash of 1929, the naive en-
thusiasm and greed of small investors gave the average closed-end 
fund a 50 percent premium. One closed-end fund, the Goldman 
Sachs Trading Corporation, sold for a 100 percent premium. (After 
the crash, its price dropped 98 percent.)
Figure 14-1 shows that discounts of 20 to 30 percent were com-
mon in the 1970s, but then declined, perhaps because investors be-
came more aware of the existence of closed-end fund discounts and 
the advantages of buying funds at a discount.

A DISCOUNT IS AN ADVANTAGE
A critic of closed-end funds wrote that “frequently, closed-end 
shares representing $25 in assets will be selling for $20. Such profits 
may be largely illusory, however, because when the time comes to 
sell, the discount may persist.” The closed-end advantage does not 
depend on the disappearance of the discount. Even if the discount

never narrows, closed-end funds can be financially advantageous 
simply because investors earn dividends and capital gains on more 
stock than they paid for.
Suppose that BeatTheMarket is a closed-end fund with a NAV 
of $10 and a market price of $8, a 20 percent discount. Each share 
of BeatTheMarket implicitly owns stocks that would cost $10 if 
purchased directly. If BeatTheMarket can be bought for $8, inves-
tors pay $8 and receive dividends and capital gains on $10 worth of 
stock. If the annual dividends and capital gains are 10 percent of 
$10, investors receive $1 in dividends and capital gains on an $8 in-
vestment—a 12.5 percent return. Why pay $10 for stock that you 
can buy for $8?
Closed-end funds do have expenses, typically around one per-
cent a year, a figure that is roughly consistent with a 10 percent dis-
count. But these expenses do not explain why funds sell for 20 
percent or 30 percent discounts. Nor do they explain why so many 
people invest in load funds, paying a premium over net asset value, 
when they could buy shares in a closed-end fund at a discount from 
net asset value. Closed-end funds may not beat the market, but 
they certainly beat open-end funds, especially those with load fees. 
Compared to open-end funds, closed-end funds are $100 bills on 
the sidewalk.
The explanation that most observers have settled on is that mu-
tual funds are not bought, but sold, in the sense that people do not 
buy funds based on their own independent research but are instead 
sold funds by people who benefit from the sale, much like people are 
sold products by infomercials. Closed-end funds have no sales­people 
because they do not issue new shares. Large investors prefer to man-
age their own portfolios while small investors, the natural audience 
for mutual funds, are persuaded to buy open-end funds with load 
charges by salespeople who profit from the load.
I always have an eye out for closed-end funds selling for large 
­discounts.

THE JAPAN FUND
If a closed-end fund sells at a discount from its net asset value, it is 
worth more dead than alive, in that its shareholders would benefit if 
the fund sold its portfolio and distributed the proceeds to its share-
holders, either directly or by repurchasing the fund’s stock.
Let’s look again at BeatTheMarket, a closed-end fund with 10 
million shares outstanding and holding stocks with an aggregate 
market value of $100 million, giving a net asset value of $10 a share. 
If the fund can repurchase one million of its shares in the open mar-
ket for $8 a share (a 20 percent discount from NAV), this will cost 
$8 million, reducing its assets from $100 million to $92 million and 
reducing the number of outstanding shares from 10 million to 9 mil-
lion. The net asset value increases from $10 to $10.22:
NAV
$92 million
9 million
$10.22
=
=
If the fund continues to sell at a 20 percent discount, the market 
price rises to $8.17.
The repurchase of shares at a discount always increases the net 
asset value of the remaining shares. Shareholders who sell do so vol-
untarily; those who stay enjoy an increase in the net asset value of 
their shares. Win-win. If a fund’s repurchase plan narrows the dis-
count, so much the better.
An even more shareholder-friendly plan would be for BeatThe-
Market to liquidate its $100 million stock portfolio and give its 
shareholders $10 a share, 25 percent more than the market price of 
their BeatTheMarket stock.
Why don’t closed-end funds routinely repurchase shares when-
ever a discount appears? The most convincing reason is that man-
agement fees depend on the size of a fund; so, while repurchases are 
good for shareholders, they are not good for management. A liquida-
tion would be even worse for fund managers as it would cost them 
their jobs.

Closed-End Funds      205
Sometimes this understandable reluctance is overcome by ag-
gressive investors who gain control of the fund and liquidate its as-
sets. In the 1930s, Claude Odell made millions of dollars by 
liquidating closed-end funds.
A more recent case involved T. Boone Pickens III, the youngest 
son of the famous corporate raider. In 1987 he announced that he 
and several partners had acquired a 5.5 percent stake in the Japan 
Fund, which was then selling at a 20 percent discount from net asset 
value. With $700 million in assets, this 20 percent discount implied 
a $140 million gap between the market value of the Japan Fund’s 
shares and the liquidation value of its assets.
Fearful that Pickens would force a liquidation, the fund’s manag-
ers recommended that shareholders approve a resolution converting 
the company into an open-end fund. This move would eliminate the 
discount, thereby increasing the value of the fund’s shares and satis-
fying Pickens and other shareholders while preserving the manag-
ers’ jobs. The resolution was overwhelmingly supported by those 
shareholders who voted, but not enough voted to give it the neces-
sary approval by 51 percent of all outstanding shares. The fund’s 
managers quickly resubmitted the resolution and lobbied even 
harder for shareholder approval. The second time around, it did 
pass, and Pickens and his partners had a $10 million profit for their 
efforts on behalf of all shareholders.
It is interesting that, even after the conversion resolution passed 
in May 1987, the fund’s discount did not immediately go to zero but 
hovered around 5 percent. The open-end conversion would not hap-
pen until July and investors were evidently worried that the inflated 
Japanese stock market might crash. Either that, or $100 bills were 
lying on the sidewalk.
I was tempted to go for a 5 percent profit on a two-month invest-
ment, but I decided to pass. A friend of mine, a Stanford professor 
of economics, invested heavily in the Japan Fund, even taking out a 
home equity loan to buy shares. He figured that a 5 percent return 
over two months was a briefcase full of $100 bills. It would have 

206      MONEY MACHINE
been more prudent to hedge his position by selling Nikkei futures. 
If the Japanese stock market crashed, the profits on his futures 
would offset the drop in the fund’s net asset value. Instead, he took 
an unhedged position.
There were some scary ups and downs over the next two 
months, but the Japan Fund’s NAV when it went open-end was 
about the same as when he bought shares, and he made his 5 per-
cent profit.
There was a very different situation in 1986. The Korea Fund, a 
closed-end fund that invests in Korean stocks, had 5 million shares 
outstanding with a net asset value of $18 and a market price of $32, 
a 78 percent premium over net asset value. At the time, it was difficult 
for Americans to invest directly in Korean stocks, and the Korea 
Fund was the only U.S. fund that the Korean government allowed to 
buy Korean stocks. Americans were willing to pay a 78 percent pre-
mium to do so through the Korea Fund. The idea that Korean com-
panies were prospering was compelling. The idea that Korean 
investors did not know this and had wildly underestimated the value 
of Korean stocks was preposterous.
The Japan Fund, which sold at a discount, could help its share-
holders by repurchasing shares. The Korea Fund, which sold at a 
premium, could help its shareholders by issuing new shares. It did. 
The Korea Fund sold 1.2 million new shares at $32, raising $38.4 
million. This increased the fund’s net asset value from $18 to 
$20.71. Existing shareholders happily saw the net asset value of 
their shares increase 15 percent because new shareholders happily 
overpaid.
On December 31, 2015, Korea Fund shares sold for $31.85—a 10.2 
percent discount from net asset value. A $10,000 investment in the 
Korea Fund in 1986 would have grown to $63,000 compared to 
$171,000 for a dollar investment in the S&P 500. The Korean mira-
cle was real, but buying Korea Fund stock at an unrealistic premium 
was a distinctly poor investment.

FIRST FINANCIAL FUND
There was a time when banking was a boring profession—basically 
assessing the credit worthiness of local loan applicants (many of 
whom the bankers knew personally) and keeping accurate records. 
It was said to be as easy as 1, 2, 3. Pay your depositors one percent, 
loan the money out at 2 percent, and be on the golf course by 3 p.m. 
In the 1960s and early 1970s, savings and loan associations (S&Ls) 
paid their depositors 2 to 5 percent interest and loaned the money 
out in mortgages at 4 to 8 percent, enough to pay depositors, cover 
expenses, and make a profit, too.
Mortgage rates topped 8 percent in 1971 and hit an unprece-
dented 10 percent in 1978. Most observers thought that interest 
rates would soon fall to more normal levels. They were wrong. Inter-
est rates went higher still, to 18 percent plus in 1981. Homeowners 
who had mortgages with single-digit interest rates were lucky. The 
S&Ls they had borrowed from were not so lucky.
S&Ls had to raise deposit rates to double-digit levels to hold on 
to their depositors, but were earning single-digit interest rates on 
mortgages written in the 1960s and 1970s. The net worth of S&Ls 
nationwide fell from $23 billion at the end of 1977 to a frightening 
–$44 billion at the end of 1981. Yes, that is a negative sign in front of 
the dollar sign. The S&L industry was bankrupt. Nearly a quarter of 
the S&Ls operating in the 1970s collapsed or merged in the early 
1980s.
So widespread and severe was the damage that Edward Yardeni, 
a Yale classmate and chief economist at Prudential-Bache, a major 
brokerage firm, defied the conventional wisdom and predicted a 
drop in interest rates. His outside-the-box reasoning was that the 
Federal Reserve would lower interest rates to bail out banks and 
S&Ls. In February 1985, he wrote, “The Fed must lower interest 
rates to offset the erosion of the financial system’s net worth. . . . 
Otherwise the financial system will collapse.”
He was right. Interest rates tumbled downward.

208      MONEY MACHINE
Unfortunately, Congress intervened in a clumsy way by deregu-
lating the industry, allowing S&Ls to move away from their tradi-
tional emphasis on home mortgages and make more business loans. 
Some states, including California and Texas, allowed state-chartered 
S&Ls to invest in almost anything, including restaurants, health 
clubs, and wind farms.
S&Ls that were bleeding money and technically bankrupt had a 
choice—moan and groan through their death pangs or throw the 
dice and hope for a lucky roll. Bankrupt S&Ls could gamble with 
taxpayer money. Their net worth was already negative and the top 
executives would soon be unemployed; nothing worse could happen 
to them. If they took a huge gamble and lost, it would just be more 
money that the government had to pay their insured depositors. But 
if the gamble paid off, it might save the bank, and their jobs. These 
technically bankrupt S&Ls were zombie banks—dead, but walking 
about because of the magic of government intervention. No sur-
prise that many zombie banks rolled the dice.
Others took advantage of the newfound freedom. Instead of ap-
plying for a loan that might be rejected, real estate developers took 
over S&Ls and loaned themselves money. It was cheaper for devel-
opers to pay deposit interest rates than to pay loan rates, and easier 
to get your loan approved if you owned the bank. They sometimes 
even paid themselves large fees for finding such attractive borrow-
ers—themselves! One developer acquired an $11 million savings 
bank in California and increased its assets to $1 billion in less than 
three years, using half the deposits to finance the developer’s real es-
tate deals. He was unapologetic: “Who would you rather lend to, 
yourself or a stranger?”
Interest rates fell after 1982, but losses in the banking industry 
continued. The problem was no longer an interest rate squeeze, but 
mounting loan defaults—caused too often by excessive risk-taking 
or outright fraud: depositor money squandered on desert land and 
lavish bonuses. By 1990, the S&L industry had a negative net worth 
of at least $200 billion. The government finally realized its mistake. 

Closed-End Funds      209
It began supervising S&Ls more closely and moving quickly to chop 
off the heads of zombie banks.
First Financial Fund (FF) was launched in May 1986, in the midst 
of the S&L crisis, with the objective of investing in midsize banks 
and S&Ls. What a terrible idea! First Financial’s stock price quickly 
fell to a 20 percent discount from NAV. I saw this evidently dumb 
idea as an opportunity. If most investors think the banking industry 
is going under, bank stocks are probably cheap. Remember Warren 
Buffett’s advice: “Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when 
others are fearful.”
As for the fundamentals, the First Financial’s 2 percent dividend 
yield was okay, the price-earnings ratio of 6 was seductive, and the 
fact that the managers were repurchasing the fund’s stock at a 20 
percent discount showed me that they cared about shareholders. 
Still, it was mostly a contrarian strategy based on my suspicion that 
the stock market had probably overreacted to the banking crisis, 
making banks and S&L stocks bargains and making First Financial’s 
20 percent discount on these bargain prices a double bargain. I in-
vested a large amount in First Financial in 1986 and 1987, at a 20 per-
cent discount to NAV, and held on for the ride.
First Financial’s annual return was 19.4 percent during its first 
twenty years, compared to 11.6 percent for the S&P 500. An invest-
ment of $10,000 in First Financial at its inception was worth 
$345,000 twenty years later, compared to $90,000 for a similar in-
vestment in the S&P 500. It was a good twenty years for the overall 
stock market, but it was a great twenty years for First Financial.
Unfortunately, First Financial’s success attracted the interest of 
an outside group that gained control of First Financial in 2006. The 
outside group changed the fund’s name to First Opportunity Fund 
in 2008, and the fund was delisted from the New York Stock Ex-
change in 2010 when its focus changed from investing in banks and 
S&Ls to investing in hedge funds. Figure 14-2 shows First Financial’s 
cumulative return compared to the S&P 500 from its inception in 
1986 until its delisting in 2010.

210      MONEY MACHINE
If bought at the beginning and held the entire time First Finan-
cial was in existence, a $10,000 investment in FF would have grown 
to $191,000 compared to $87,000 from an investment in the S&P 
500. An investor prescient enough to get out in 2006, when outside 
investors gained control of First Financial, would have done even 
better.
I got out in 2004, too early, but it is foolish to think that one can 
buy at the bottom and sell at the top, except by accident. My simple 
logic for selling was my concern about the outside group’s inten-
tions. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. I could see the possible upside 
from an outside group taking over a company that was doing badly 
and shaking things up. But where was the upside from shaking 
things up at a company that was doing wonderfully?
The intended lesson from this example is that value investors 
should be alert for contrarian opportunities. Just as the dot-com 
bubble was a time to sell, panics and crises are times to buy.

Closed-End Funds      211
DUAL-PURPOSE FUNDS
Dual-purpose funds are closed-end funds with two shareholder 
classes: income and capital. The income shareholders receive all the 
dividends from the stocks in the fund’s portfolio; the capital share-
holders receive all the capital gains on the fund’s termination date, 
typically ten to twenty years after the fund’s inception.
On the termination date, the income-shareholders receive a 
specified redemption price (usually their initial investment), or the 
value of the fund’s assets if this is less than the redemption price. 
The capital-shareholders get any excess of the fund’s assets over this 
redemption price.
Consider a fund that starts by selling one million income shares 
for $10 and one million capital shares for $10, with a fifteen-year ter-
mination at a $10 redemption price for the income-shareholders. 
Each income share receives dividends on $20 worth of stock, plus 
$10 back in fifteen years. If the fund’s stocks have a 5 percent divi-
dend yield, the income-shareholders get a 10 percent dividend since 
they invested $10 and get dividends on $20.
The capital shares, meanwhile, have 2-to-1 leverage. If the value 
of the portfolio increases by 50 percent, from $20 to $30, the value 
of the capital shares increases by 100 percent, from $10 to $20. If 
the portfolio goes up 100 percent, the capital shares go up 200 
percent.
Dual-purpose funds were created to meet the differing needs of 
investors, particularly when dividends and capital gains are taxed at 
different rates. Individuals and institutions in low tax brackets have 
a natural affinity for the generous dividends paid to the income 
shares. The capital shares hold special appeal to investors who pay 
lower taxes on capital gains than on dividends, and to investors who 
seek leverage.
No one can be made worse off by splitting the fund’s shares into 
two classes, because investors can, if they want, buy equal amounts 

212      MONEY MACHINE
of both. If you own one percent of the income shares and one per-
cent of the capital shares, you get one percent of the profits, no 
matter how they are divided, just as if the company were an ordi-
nary closed-end fund. But there are two big differences. First, a 
dual-purpose fund gives investors flexibility in varying the propor-
tion of dividend income to capital gains. Second, a dual-purpose 
fund’s discount must go to zero on the termination date.
Figure 14-3 shows the seventeen-year history of the Gemini 
Fund, a very successful dual-purpose fund that was started in 1967 
and terminated on December 31, 1984. In 1974 the capital shares 
sold at close to a 40 percent discount and the combined income 
and capital shares were at a 15 percent discount. For anyone who 
wanted to invest in stocks over the next ten years, this was an ap-
pealing way to do so. The capital shares had tremendous leverage 
with a huge discount that was guaranteed to vanish.

E
very once in a while, Mr. Market offers special opportunities 
for buying or selling stocks. Remember, Mr. Market is not an 
all-wise impartial judge who tells us what things are really worth. 
Mr. Market spouts prices that are sometimes reasonable and some-
times foolish. Value investors who can distinguish the reasonable 
from the foolish can take advantage of Mr. Market’s foolishness.
This is not easy. Yes, Mr. Market makes mistakes, but market 
prices that seem baffling to you and me may not be mistakes. It is 
easy to be lured by the promise of easy money. (I know from per-
sonal experience!) It takes willpower to step back and ask the perti-
nent questions:
1.	 Is this information from a reliable source? Ignore hot tips 
from auto mechanics about environmental companies.
2.	 Is it illegal insider information? Don’t do time for doing a 
crime.
3.	 Why isn’t it already embedded in the market price? Don’t 
others know? Are others confused?

MASSIVELY CONFUSED INVESTORS
Stocks are identified by ticker symbols that were originally created 
to speed up the transmission of trading reports on ticker tape ma-
chines. Actively traded stocks were given single-letter ticker sym-
bols; for example, the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway (A) 
and American Telephone and Telegraph (T). Today, New York Stock 
Exchange stocks have one to three letters plus additional characters 
that can be used to identify the type of security; for example, Citi-
group (C), General Electric (GE), and Berkshire class A (BRK.A). 
Ticker symbols are usually abbreviations of a company’s name, and 
companies sometimes become known by these abbreviations: GE, 
IBM, 3M.
Companies choose their ticker symbols, though exchanges can 
reject a choice that is offensive, misleading, or duplicates another 
company’s symbol. In practice, the company’s choice is almost al-
ways honored. One notable exception was Furr’s/Bishop’s Inc., 
which applied for the symbol FBI, but was rejected because this is 
the well-known acronym for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In 
a perfectly efficient market, this shouldn’t have mattered, but appar-
ently the ticker-approvers thought it did.
The efficient market hypothesis says that investors cannot use 
public information to beat the market. A stock’s ticker symbol is no 
secret and it would be surprising if a stock’s performance were re-
lated to its ticker symbol. Surely, savvy investors focus on a compa-
ny’s profitability, not its ticker symbol!
Investors are not always savvy. After Charles Lindbergh’s historic 
1927 flight from New York to Paris, there was a surge in the price of 
airline stocks including Seaboard Air Line Railroad, even though 
Seaboard was a railroad whose name “Air Line” referred to its long 
stretches of straight track.
In his Harvard economics PhD thesis, Michael S. Rashes re-
ported several instances where investors were confused about 

216      MONEY MACHINE
ticker symbols. Two completely different firms, Massmutual Cor-
porate Investors (traded on the NYSE with the ticker symbol 
MCI) and MCI Communications (traded on the NASDAQ with 
the ticker symbol MCIC), exhibited a strong correlation in their 
prices, apparently because investors who wanted to invest in MCI 
Communications mistakenly bought Massmutual stock. Rashes 
wrote an article about this and other examples using the wonderful 
title, “Massively Confused Investors Making Conspicuously Igno-
rant Choices.”
Rashes also found that Transcontinental Realty Investors (TCI) 
was mistaken for Tele-Communications Inc., causing TCI’s price 
to be affected by news about the possible takeover of Tele-­
Communications by Bell Atlantic and later AT&T. Similarly, Castle 
Convertible Fund, a mutual fund with the ticker symbol CVF, 
briefly fell 32 percent after the Financial Times published a report of 
impending losses for the Czech Value Fund, which it abbreviated 
as CVF. A 1998 Barron’s article was bullish on the Morgan Stanley 
Asia Pacific Fund, but the ticker symbol was misprinted as APB, 
rather than APF. The ticker symbol APB belongs to the Barings 
Asia Pacific Fund, which opened up 30 percent the first trading day 
after the Barron’s article appeared.
In 1999, AppNet Systems filed for an initial public offering (IPO) 
under the ticker symbol APPN, which was currently being used by 
Appian Technology. In the two days following the filing (when it was 
not yet possible to trade AppNet stock), 7.3 million shares of Appian 
Technology stock were traded (compared to 200 shares the day be-
fore AppNet’s IPO filing) and the price increased by 142,757 per-
cent. During the initial public offering of Ticketmaster 
Online-CitySearch using the ticker symbol TCMS, shares of Temco 
Service Industries, whose ticker symbol was and had previously 
been TCMS, rose from $28.875 to $65 before investors realized their 
mistake and the price plunged to $25.50. When online retailer Ama-
zon had an IPO in 1997 using the ticker symbol AMZN, a company 
called Amazon Natural Treasures, which had been using the ticker 

Special Opportunities      217
symbol AMZN before Amazon went public (and switched to AZNT 
afterward), rose from $1 a share to $3 and then fell back to $1 after 
investors realized their mistake.
The Pokémon GO smartphone game burst on the scene in the 
summer of 2016. Users can find various Poké items superimposed on 
a map of their own actual geographic location and can capture wild 
Pokémon by throwing Poké Balls at them. Pokémon GO was an in-
explicable success, quickly downloaded by more than 100 million 
people. Seemingly everywhere, kids were walking around with their 
faces glued to their smartphones. Some were hit by cars. Dozens of 
adults crashed their cars while playing and driving, including one 
person who slammed into a police car. (I won’t make any jokes about 
the Darwin Awards for people who voluntarily improve the gene 
pool.)
Pokémon GO was developed by Niantic, a Google spin-off, 
using Google Maps. Nintendo had invested in Niantic, and Figure 
15-1 shows that during a two-week period (July 5 to July 18), Ninten-
do’s stock more than doubled, from $17.63 to $37.37, while daily 
trading volume surged from 26,000 shares to more than 13 million. 
Investors evidently had not spent much time investigating the ex-
tent of Nintendo’s investment and the effect it might have on Nin-
tendo’s profits. On July 24, Nintendo issued a statement saying it 
had only a 13 percent interest in Niantic. Nintendo stock promptly 
plummeted 18 percent, the maximum allowed on the Tokyo stock 
exchange.
Commentators blamed the run-up and subsequent crash on “re-
tail investors” who had not done their homework. I’m pretty sure 
that more than a few professional investors hadn’t done their home-
work, either. If the much-maligned small investors had pushed Nin-
tendo’s stock price higher than the pros thought appropriate, the 
pros would have sold heavily, keeping the price from doubling.

Chapter 9 includes a discussion of a study I did (with two colleagues) 
of professional forecasts of corporate earnings. We found that the 
most optimistic predictions tended to be too optimistic and the 
most pessimistic predictions tended to be too pessimistic. One con-
sequence was that, on average, stocks with pessimistic earnings 
forecasts outperformed stocks with optimistic forecasts.
In August 2015, I had $100,000 to invest and decided to test this 
strategy with real money. I had access to a pretty comprehensive da-
tabase of real-time corporate-earnings forecasts made by profes-
sionals who are paid a lot of money to make these forecasts. I 
restricted my analysis to companies with forecasts from at least

twenty-five analysts to ensure that the companies were prominent, 
highly visible, and closely scrutinized. Any systematic inaccuracies 
could not be explained away as careless guesses about unimportant 
companies. I used the median prediction to reduce the influence of 
outliers.
I had planned to divide the $100,000 evenly among the ten com-
panies with the most pessimistic forecasts. All ten turned out to be 
in the energy sector. So, I bought a diversified portfolio of energy-
related companies by investing $100,000 in Vanguard Energy Fund 
on August 19, 2015.
An all-energy portfolio, by itself, is not very diversified. True di-
versification would involve stocks from many sectors of the econ-
omy. Not to worry. I didn’t own any energy stocks in the rest of my 
portfolio.
This was a challenging test of a contrarian strategy. It is not easy 
to invest in stocks that others loathe—especially stocks in an indus-
try that others shun. My wife repeated the dire warnings she read 
about the energy sector and advised me not to throw away money on 
these stocks. This fortified my resolve. I remembered the advice to 
be greedy when others are fearful, and there was certainly a lot of 
fear about energy stocks. It was probably true that their earnings for 
the next few years would be dismal, but I also suspected that Mr. 
Market may have overreacted. I know that value investors look for 
good companies at bargain prices—not bad companies at bargain 
prices—but I also know that bargains can be found among bad 
­companies.
The first few months were not pretty. Five months in, the S&P 
500 was down 11 percent and my Vanguard Energy Fund was down 
24 percent. This was another test of contrarian temperament. Let’s 
take a moment for a pop quiz: When prices plunge, is a contrarian-
investor’s first reaction to:
a.	 Sell everything in order to contain the damage.
b.	 Buy more at even better prices. 

220      MONEY MACHINE
The correct answer is (b), following the adage, “If you like a stock at 
$100, you will love it at $75.” In this case, I didn’t buy more, but I 
didn’t bail out, either.
I was happy to see energy rebound. Figure 15-2 shows the one-
year return, from August 19, 2015, to August 19, 2016, on the Van-
guard Energy Fund and the S&P 500. The return on the S&P 500 
was 5.0 percent; the return on the energy fund was 12.4 percent.
FIGURE 15-2. A contrarian investment
In practice, a strategy based on earnings forecasts is difficult for 
most people to implement because they don’t have access to the da-
tabase I used. However, there are some useful lessons.
As lesson one, this story is yet more tangible proof that contrar-
ian strategies can pay off. Don’t be afraid to invest in stocks that 
others hate; that’s just another reason the stocks may be cheap. In 
fact, if a stock is inexpensive relative to its earnings and dividends, 
it is usually because other investors don’t like something about the 
stock.
This principle is true not only of stocks, but also bonds, real es-
tate, and other investments. For example, low-rated bonds with a

substantial risk of default are called junk bonds. John Kenneth Gal-
braith, an illustrious Harvard professor, wrote that “anyone who 
buys a junk bond known as a junk bond deserves on the whole to 
lose.” Why would any rational investor buy a junk bond when it is 
clearly labeled a junk bond? Because everything has a price. As long 
as a bond has some chance of paying some interest, somebody will 
pay some price for it. The price will be low and the potential yield 
high, but there will be a buyer. That is why junk bonds are also 
known euphemistically as high-yield bonds—they must offer high 
yields to persuade investors to hold them.
During the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s, some S&Ls 
bought junk because they were buying it with other people’s 
money—their federally insured deposits. S&Ls were willing to bor-
row from their depositors at 5 to 10 percent interest to invest in 
junk bonds promising 15 to 20 percent returns because the profits, if 
any, would go to the S&L and the losses would be covered by federal 
deposit insurance. Heads, the S&L wins. Tails, the federal govern-
ment loses.
As it turned out, up until the end of 1989, junk bonds were prof-
itable for thrifts. A 1989 General Accounting Office report found 
that junk had not contributed to the S&L crisis up to that point and 
that junk bonds had, in fact, been one of the S&L industry’s most 
profitable investments.
However, the years surveyed in this report had been recession 
free. Concerned about potential future defaults and recognizing the 
one-sided bets S&Ls were making with federally insured deposits, 
the 1989 Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement 
Act (FIRREA) prohibited thrifts from buying additional junk bonds 
and gave them five years to sell their current holdings. As FIRREA 
neared completion, some thrifts made substantial last-minute junk 
purchases. One industry analyst said that these thrifts “realized this 
was their last window of opportunity, so they jumped in. It was a 
case of speeding up at the yellow light.” During the last forty days 
before FIRREA was enacted, ten of these hot-rod thrifts bought a 

222      MONEY MACHINE
total of more than $1 billion in junk bonds, increasing their holdings 
by 19 percent.
In retrospect, their timing couldn’t have been worse. With fur-
ther purchases prohibited and sales mandated, FIRREA created an 
excess supply of junk. Coupled with Drexel-Burnham’s bankruptcy, 
the junk bond market collapsed, as prices fell some 10 to 15 percent 
in the first three months after FIRREA’s prohibition went into ef-
fect. The same industry analyst quoted previously continued the 
analogy: “After they got to the [yellow] light, the market went over 
the cliff.”
This is yet again an example of how market prices need not equal 
the best estimate of the value of an investment. Junk bonds were not 
more likely to default after FIRREA passed. The intrinsic value of 
their anticipated cash flow was unchanged, yet market prices col-
lapsed because thrift institutions could no longer hold junk. It is as 
if prohibiting pension funds from buying Coca-Cola stock somehow 
changed the intrinsic value of Coke stock.
Trust Company of the West (TCW) recognized that the drop in 
junk prices was not warranted. Wall Street was having a sale on junk 
bonds and TCW loaded up. It turned out to be a spectacular invest-
ment. After the junk collapse, junk bond prices nearly doubled over 
the next three years—which is yet another example of the first les-
son to be learned from my energy investment: A contrarian strategy 
can be wise, not foolish.
A second lesson from my energy investment is: don’t panic if Mr. 
Market doesn’t like your investment. The tax benefits from harvest-
ing losses is a good reason to sell stocks that have gone down in 
price. Selling because you fear prices may fall further is not a good 
reason. If anything, falling prices may be a persuasive reason to buy 
more.
The third lesson is a reminder that contrarian investors need to 
have the temperament to buy stocks that others hate and resolve 
not to panic if prices fall.

AT&T CANADA
When AT&T acquired the Canadian telephone company Metronet 
(renamed AT&T Canada) in June 1999, foreigners were not allowed 
to own more than 33 percent of a Canadian company; so AT&T 
bought 31 percent of the shares and agreed to buy the remaining 69 
percent by June 2003, either for itself or for resale to a Canadian 
company. AT&T agreed to a floor on the buyout price starting at 
$37.50 Canadian dollars in June 2000, with the floor rising by 17 per-
cent a year to $60 in June 2003. To prevent an infinite stalling strat-
egy, AT&T also agreed that if it had not purchased the remaining 69 
percent by July 2003, it would sell AT&T Canada and pay whatever 
was needed to ensure that AT&T Canada shareholders got at least 
their preset floor.
At the time of the acquisition in June 1999, AT&T Canada 
stock was selling for $84.01. AT&T had big plans for making the 
company even more valuable, so the floor price did not seem like a 
big deal. However, AT&T Canada floundered, losing $325 million 
in 2000 and $456 million in 2001, and its stock price fell below  
the floor in May 2001. I saw a story about this unusual situation  
in ­October 2001. Since the floor was guaranteed to increase by  
17 percent a year, it seemed like a guaranteed annual return of 17 
percent.
I did a little research and found that some hedge funds had no-
ticed this quirky situation, too, and their lawyers had concluded that 
about the only way AT&T could get out of the contract was to de-
clare bankruptcy, which seemed unlikely since they had far more as-
sets than the cost of fulfilling their AT&T Canada commitment. The 
only real uncertainty for American investors (like me) was that the 
buyout price was in Canadian dollars and I live my life using U.S. 
dollars. If the value of the U.S. dollar were to drop relative to the Ca-
nadian dollar, my annual return would be less than 17 percent. Of 
course, if the U.S. dollar were to appreciate, my annual return would 
be more than 17 percent. I figured that the U.S. dollar was as likely 

224      MONEY MACHINE
to appreciate as depreciate, so I was looking at an expected annual 
return of 17 percent. I also figured that AT&T knew that the cost of 
fulfilling this contract was rising by 17 percent a year, so it would buy 
the shares as soon as possible.
This was definitely not a value play. AT&T Canada was a mess. It 
was losing money and paid no dividends—not the honey that at-
tracts value investors. Still, it seemed to be a unique opportunity. I 
bought shares in October 2001 at a price equal to the current floor 
price and, a year later, in October 2002, AT&T fulfilled its contrac-
tual obligation by purchasing the remaining 69 percent stake at the 
prevailing floor price. I had my 17 percent return.
LEHMAN BROTHERS
Henry, Emanuel, and Mayer Lehman, the sons of a Bavarian cattle 
merchant, immigrated to Montgomery, Alabama, in the 1840s. They 
started a dry-goods store in 1844 that evolved into a cotton-trading 
business and, eventually, the fourth-largest U.S. investment bank in 
2002—named, appropriately enough, Lehman Brothers.
Between 2002 and 2007, Lehman invested heavily in mortgages 
made to so-called subprime borrowers who would not normally 
qualify for mortgages. At the time, many investment banks bundled 
mortgages into mortgage-backed securities. Traditionally, home 
buyers borrowed money from a local bank and paid off their mort-
gage over, say, thirty years. A mortgage-backed security is a collec-
tion of mortgages purchased from banks and resold to investors, 
with the monthly mortgage payments passed through to the owners 
of the mortgage-backed security.
In theory, mortgage-backed securities allow insurance compa-
nies, pension funds, and other investors to make home loans part of 
their portfolios. They also channel more money to mortgage lending 
because every time a bank makes a mortgage loan and sells it, the 
bank gets more money for more mortgage loans.

Special Opportunities      225
In practice, local banks are best able to evaluate the strength of 
the local real estate market and the creditworthiness of borrowers, 
and they have a clear incentive to do so when they are going to hold 
a mortgage for thirty years. If the borrower defaults, the bank is 
stuck with the bad loan. However, if the mortgage is sold to some-
one else, it is no longer the bank’s problem; so the bank doesn’t have 
as much incentive to scrutinize loans carefully. Banks made profits 
based on the number of mortgages they originated, not on the 
monthly mortgage payments.
This problem was exacerbated by the creation of national mort-
gage brokers who have little knowledge of local real estate markets 
and no personal knowledge of loan applicants. Their compensation 
is based on making mortgages, and making mortgages is what they 
did, including NINJA loans to applicants with No Income, No Job, 
and No Assets. At the first sign of trouble, the borrower disappears 
like a Ninja in the night. Too many mortgage loans were made (often 
at initially low teaser rates) to people who had no realistic chance of 
making the mortgage payments. Too many mortgage brokers got 
rich selling NINJA loans to unsuspecting investors.
Somehow, these mortgage-backed bundles of subprime loans 
were rated AAA, and naive investors bought them. The idea must 
have been that the odds were low that every NINJA loan would 
­default. But if NINJA borrowers were counting on home prices ris-
ing and selling their homes before the teaser loan rates expired, 
most NINJA borrowers would be in trouble if home prices stopped 
­rising.
Not only that, but investment banks created collateralized debt 
obligations (CDOs), which are bundles of mortgage-backed securi-
ties sliced into so-called tranches. Investors who bought the lowest 
(“junior”) tranches received a disproportionate share of the interest 
and coupons from the underlying mortgages, but were the first to 
lose their income if borrowers defaulted. Investors who bought the 
highest (“senior”) tranches received less interest and coupons, but 
were the last to be affected if borrowers defaulted.

226      MONEY MACHINE
As if that weren’t complicated enough, investment banks created 
CDOs-squared, which are CDOs backed by the tranches of other 
CDOs. A junior CDO-squared consisted of junior tranches from 
several CDOs. In theory, this offered more diversification than a ju-
nior tranche from a single CDO. In practice, if falling home prices 
caused one junior CDO to crash, most would.
The legal documents were thousands of pages long, read by few, 
and understood by fewer. Many investors ignored the sound advice, 
“Don’t invest in something you don’t understand.”
Lehman created a lot of CDOs and ended up holding a lot of the 
junior tranches. We don’t know if this was because Lehman couldn’t 
offload the junior tranches to other investors or if Lehman thought 
junior tranches were a profitable investment. Lehman was highly 
leveraged, borrowing billions of dollars to invest billions of dollars. 
When the profits on their investments were larger than the interest 
on the loans used to finance these investments, Lehman’s employees 
and stock holders made a lot of money. Lehman’s CEO, Richard 
Fuld, was paid $485 million between 2000 and 2007.
It is wise advice to expect the unexpected. Lehman expected 
the expected until the unexpected happened. Home prices 
stopped rising and started falling. Strapped borrowers couldn’t 
make their mortgage payments and couldn’t sell their homes for 
enough money to pay off their mortgages. Home builders stopped 
building and ripples from unemployed construction workers 
spread through the economy. Many borrowers lost their jobs and 
then their homes. Lehman started losing lots of money on its 
highly leveraged CDOs.
Lehman was also heavily involved with credit default swaps. In a 
credit default swap (CDS), one party pays a fee to pass the risk of a 
loan or bond default on to someone else. For example, a pension 
fund might own a bond issued by a corporation or foreign govern-
ment and be concerned that the borrower may default. The pension 
fund buys a CDS from a third party, which agrees to buy the bond 
from the pension fund at face value if the borrower defaults.

Special Opportunities      227
The pension fund has purchased default insurance. In theory, the 
third party that sold the insurance is acting like all sensible insur-
ance companies. It has assessed the chances of default and deter-
mined that the expected value of the cost is less than the fee. If it is 
a large, financially secure institution with a diversified portfolio of 
credit default swaps, it assumes that it will be little affected by an 
occasional default. It will be in a world of trouble, however, if some 
macroeconomic event, like a global recession, causes a wave of de-
faults—just like insurance companies operating in Chicago were 
bankrupted by the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.
A lot of institutions didn’t use credit default swaps for insurance, 
but for speculation. A hedge fund might buy billions of dollars of 
credit default swaps on bonds it doesn’t own, which is an unhedged 
bet that the borrowers will default. Lehman had, in fact, purchased 
$250 billion in CDS contracts on bonds it didn’t own. Ironically, 
$400 billion in CDS contracts had been created by investors who 
wanted to bet for and against Lehman’s bankruptcy. 
The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve have often operated under 
the assumption that some companies are “too big to fail,” meaning 
that because of the interconnected nature of the financial system, 
the failure of a large company will have ripple effects that cripple 
the economy. If a large bank fails, it won’t be able to repay its loans 
from other banks. If these other banks can’t collect their loans, they 
may go bankrupt, too, which means they can’t repay their loans. Per-
haps even worse, if companies are worried about a company failing, 
they won’t lend them money or sell them anything for fear that they 
won’t be repaid. For a bank, this might mean they can’t buy stocks 
or bonds; for an industrial company, it might mean that they can’t 
buy the raw materials they need to keep operating. It becomes a 
self-fulfilling prophecy in that, unable to borrow money or buy 
things, a company that is thought to be in danger of failing does fail. 
The larger the company, the larger the risk of a contagious collapse. 
Thus the federal government considers some companies to be too 
big to fail. If a too-big-to-fail company is endangered, the Treasury 

228      MONEY MACHINE
and Fed step in to lend it money to save the company (and the finan-
cial system).
The unintended consequence is that companies that consider 
themselves too big to fail are encouraged to take excessive risks, 
knowing that they will reap outsize gains if their gambles pay off and 
that they will be bailed out by the government if their gambles fail.
In March 2008, Bear Stearns was rocked by losses on its sub-
prime mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and CDOs. The Fed-
eral Reserve acted quickly to supply $29 billion to finance JPMorgan 
Chase’s purchase of Bear Stearns, explaining that it wanted to avoid 
a “chaotic unwinding” of Bear Stearns investments.
Six months later, Lehman Brothers was hit by life-threatening 
losses from its subprime mortgage securities. Lehman’s stock price 
collapsed and a Wall Street friend told me that Lehman stock was a 
great investment. Lehman Brothers’ real estate alone was worth 
more than its stock was selling for and the government wouldn’t let 
such a prominent bank fail. I invested a small amount ($20,000) be-
cause I thought my friend might be right, but I kept my investment 
small because I knew that, no matter how valuable its real estate, its 
mortgage-related losses might be even larger.
At the same time that the federal government was pushing Bank 
of America to acquire financially troubled Merrill Lynch, the Trea-
sury and Fed stood aside and let Lehman fail (perhaps because of 
criticism of the Bear Stearns bailout, perhaps because Treasury Sec-
retary Henry Paulson had been CEO of Goldman Sachs and this 
somehow influenced the decision to save one company and not the 
other).
Ironically, Lehman’s failure confirmed the too-big-to-fail argu-
ment by precipitating a financial crisis and near meltdown of finan-
cial firms and markets worldwide. Paulson persuaded Congress to 
authorize a $700 billion bailout fund, of which $160 billion was used 
to prop up American International Group (AIG) and another $170 
billion was used to stabilize the nine largest U.S. banks.
My friend was wrong, and we got burned. In retrospect, it was 

Special Opportunities      229
not a sure thing, one way or the other. It was a gamble because inves-
tors didn’t know the extent of Lehman’s losses or whether the fed-
eral government would bail out Lehman. I might have won my bet, 
but I didn’t. Lehman was a hot tip that fizzled.
CROSSLAND SAVINGS
The U.S. banking system has a wild and scary history. The Bank of 
the United States was founded in 1791, with $2 million raised from 
the federal government and $8 million from private citizens. Mod-
eled after the Bank of England, its eight branches stored private and 
government deposits and made loans to citizens and to the govern-
ment. The Bank also issued bank notes (currency) that could be re-
deemed for gold or silver. At the time, fewer than a hundred other 
banks were in operation, all smaller and located on the East Coast.
In 1810, on a narrow vote, Congress failed to renew the Bank’s 
charter and it closed. In the succeeding ten years, state-chartered 
banks and bank notes of varying repute multiplied. One historian 
wrote that “corporations and tradesmen issued ‘currency.’ Even bar-
bers and bartenders competed with banks in this respect . . . nearly 
every citizen regarded it as his constitutional right to issue money.” 
One successful Midwestern banker related his start in the business: 
“Well, I didn’t have much to do and so I rented an empty store and 
painted ‘bank’ on the window. The first day a man came in and de-
posited $100, and a couple of days later, another man deposited an-
other $250 and so along about the fourth day I got confidence 
enough in the bank to put in $1.00 myself.”
In 1816 the Second Bank of the United States was chartered. It 
actively speculated, particularly in western land, and its Baltimore 
branch made so many bad loans that it went bankrupt in 1818. In 
1819 a new head of the Second Bank reduced its speculative activi-
ties by restricting new loans and forcing some borrowers to pay off 
old ones, putting a discernible crimp in commerce. The next 

230      MONEY MACHINE
­president of the Second Bank, Nicholas Biddle, reinstituted the 
First Bank’s policy of refusing to accept bank notes that were not 
redeemable in gold or silver.
Because of these unpopular policies, the fight to renew the Bank’s 
charter in 1832 was bitter. (Biddle’s brother, who was director of the 
St. Louis branch, was killed in a duel fought at a distance of five feet 
because of Biddle’s nearsightedness.) The populist president An-
drew Jackson removed government deposits from the Second Bank 
and vetoed a bill renewing its charter. Rechartered by the state of 
Pennsylvania, Biddle’s bank failed in 1841 after excessive speculation 
and questionable loans to bank officers.
After the restraining power of the Second Bank of the United 
States was lifted, there was a surge of new banks and of unbacked 
bank money. Banks in the East were usually managed conservatively, 
with substantial reserves of gold and silver and a readiness to re-
deem their money with precious metal. Banks in other parts of the 
country were more loosely managed and were willing to lend un-
backed paper to farmers and businessmen settling new territories. 
When the land was fertile and business good, the communities and 
their banks prospered; when crops and businesses failed, their banks 
failed with them.
Thousands of private banks were established by financiers, black-
smiths, trading-post owners, and other entrepreneurs. Banks were 
regulated by the states in which they operated, and regulations re-
garding precious-metal reserves were unevenly enforced. A Massa-
chusetts bank with $500,000 in notes outstanding was found to 
have $86.48 in reserves. In Michigan, a common collection of re-
serves (including hidden lead, glass, and tenpenny nails) passed from 
bank to bank, ahead of the state examiners. Opening a bank and is-
suing bank notes seemed like a pretty easy way literally to make 
money. It was an occupation that attracted the most reputable and 
public-spirited people and the lowest and most down-and-out 
scoundrels. Many helped the country prosper, and many simply re-
distributed its wealth.

Special Opportunities      231
By the time of the Civil War, there were some 7,000 different 
types of bank currency in circulation, of which 5,000 were counter-
feit issues. Because of widespread uncertainty about the financial 
condition of banks (and the authenticity of notes), bank notes 
traded at discounts from their face value. For example, a merchant 
might accept a $10 bank note in payment for $8 worth of merchan-
dise. With the South and the Mississippi Valley not represented in 
Congress, the federal government levied a 1%, 2%, and then 10% 
annual tax on currency issued by state-chatered banks. State bank 
notes consequently declined, replaced by checking accounts. Na-
tionally chartered banks issued national bank notes, which were 
more uniformly printed and backed by government bonds deposited 
with the Treasury.
Most countries have just a handful of banks, with hundreds of 
branches. By the 1980s, there were tens of thousands of banks in 
the United States, mostly mom-and-pop banks protected by anti­
competitive laws. Banks were not allowed to pay interest on check-
ing accounts and there were interest-rate ceilings on savings 
accounts. Banks were not allowed to cross state lines, and the num-
ber of branches within a state were limited. In Illinois, for exam-
ple, banks could only have one branch, which kept the big banks in 
Chicago from poaching customers throughout rural Illinois.
Eventually, technological advances and political pressure from 
consumers and big banks led to a consolidation of the U.S. banking 
system, accelerated by the financial crises in the late 1970s and early 
1980s.
In New York, for example, many small banks had been estab-
lished decades ago to serve local neighborhoods or groups sharing 
a common ethnicity or occupation. One of these banks was 
Brevoort Savings Bank, founded in 1890 by Henry Lefferts 
Brevoort, whose family tree traced back to the first Dutch settlers 
in Brooklyn. The Brevoorts intended the Brevoort Savings Bank to 
provide safe deposits and fair loans to local families, who would no 
longer have to travel miles to get to a bank. Brevoort Savings Bank 

232      MONEY MACHINE
was the only bank in the Bedford neighborhood of Brooklyn, 
which had been settled by the Dutch in the 1600s. Brevoort was 
always well run, but it succumbed to the merger wave in the 1970s 
and 1980s, as small banks consolidated and, in essence, became 
branches of a larger entity.
The East Brooklyn Savings Bank, which had been chartered in 
1860, changed its name to the Metropolitan Savings Bank (Brook-
lyn) in 1969 and acquired Brevoort Savings Bank in 1970, Fulton Sav-
ings Bank (Brooklyn) in 1977, Spring Valley Savings & Loan 
Association in 1980, Brooklyn Savings Bank in 1981, and Greenwich 
Savings Bank in 1981.
Most of these banks were more than 100 years old. Brevoort had 
been chartered in 1890, Fulton in 1870, Spring Valley in 1889, Brook-
lyn Savings in 1827, and Greenwich in 1833. The acquisition of the 
Greenwich Savings Bank included its majestic headquarters (now 
called the Haier Building and a New York City landmark), which has 
a domed ceiling with a 3,000-square-foot, 72-foot-high stained-glass 
skylight.
The Metropolitan Savings Bank changed its name to the Federal 
Metropolitan Savings Bank in 1983 and to Crossland Savings in 1985. 
Headquartered in Brooklyn, Crossland Savings was the largest sav-
ings bank in New York State in the 1980s. With $6.5 billion in de-
posits, Crossland moved away from traditional residential mortgage 
lending in the 1980s into commercial real estate loans. Commercial 
real estate is risky because of uncertainties about rental rates and 
occupancy rates. If rents turn out to be lower than predicted or ex-
penses and vacancy rates turn out to be higher than expected, com-
mercial borrowers may fall behind or even default on their loans. On 
the other hand, banks can generally charge higher rates on commer-
cial real estate loans than on residential mortgages because the risks 
are greater. By the end of the 1980s, half of Crossland’s loans were 
for commercial real estate, including acquisition and construction 
loans. Crossland lost $442 million in the first nine months of 1989, 
mostly due to delinquencies and defaults on its real estate loans. Ru-

Special Opportunities      233
mors circulated that Crossland was on the verge of collapse and its 
stock price plummeted.
Was this an overreaction, or was Crossland going through its 
death throes? The manager of one of the nation’s largest college 
endowments told me that he was investing in Crossland Savings 
because it had an irresistible stockpile of unused capital losses. He 
expected a profitable bank to buy Crossland in order to use these 
accumulated capital losses to reduce its taxable income. By his 
reckoning, the capital losses alone were worth much more than the 
market price of Crossland’s stock, not to mention the real estate 
its 110 branches were sitting on. The $5 billion in deposits, mostly 
from hundreds of thousands of small depositors who didn’t seem to 
mind being paid relatively low interest rates, was also a plus, 
though the hundreds of millions of dollars in delinquent loans were 
a big minus.
I hadn’t been investing long and figured that this endowment 
manager knew more than I did, so I bought a few thousand dollars’ 
worth of Crossland stock in 1990. Figure 15-3 shows what happened.
In an unexpected twist, Crossland was accused of tax fraud in 
1991. Crossland was said to have set up six dummy companies in 
Delaware and shifted $152 million of its income to these Delaware 
companies in order to avoid paying New York state and city taxes on 
the income. This accusation was not the reason for Crossland’s fail-
ure, but it suggested that something might be amiss in their opera-
tions and/or accounting.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) took over 
Crossland in 1992 and pumped in $1.2 billion to keep it afloat. Three 
years later the FDIC sold Crossland to Republic Bank of New York 
for $529.6 million. My friend’s hot tip was not so hot. (Note to self: 
Be skeptical of hot tips, even tips from highly reputable and success-
ful investors.)

ROYAL DUTCH/SHELL
The Royal Dutch Petroleum Company (based in the Netherlands) 
and the Shell Transport and Trading Company (based in the United 
Kingdom) joined forces in 1907 to do battle with John D. Rockefell-
er’s Standard Oil, the largest oil refiner in the world. Royal Dutch 
would focus on production, Shell on distribution. Together, they 
might survive.
The curious thing about their agreement was that Royal Dutch 
and Shell kept their existing shareholders and their stock continued 
to trade on various stock exchanges even though all revenue and ex-
penses were consolidated by the mothership, named Royal Dutch 
Shell, which was owned 60 percent by Royal Dutch Petroleum and 
40 percent by Shell. Whatever earnings Royal Dutch Shell reported, 
60 percent were attributed to Royal Dutch Petroleum, 40 percent 
to Shell. Whatever dividends Royal Dutch Shell paid, 60 percent 
went to Royal Dutch Petroleum shareholders, 40 percent to Shell 
shareholders. If Royal Dutch Shell were ever to be sold, 60 percent 
of the proceeds would go to Royal Dutch Petroleum shareholders, 
40 percent to Shell shareholders.

On intrinsic value grounds, whatever Shell Transport was worth, 
Royal Dutch Petroleum was worth 50 percent more. If the stock 
market valued these stocks correctly, the market value of Royal 
Dutch Petroleum stock should always be 50 percent higher than the 
market of Shell Transport stock. But it wasn’t!
Figure 15-4 shows the ratio of the market value of Royal Dutch 
Petroleum stock to the market value of Shell Transport stock from 
March 13, 1957, when both stocks were traded on the New York 
Stock Exchange, until July 19, 2005, when the two companies merged 
fully and their stocks stopped being traded separately.
FIGURE 15-4 Royal Dutch Petroleum vs. Shell Transport
Royal Dutch Petroleum stock was seldom worth exactly 50 percent 
more than Shell stock. Sometimes it was 40 percent overpriced; 
sometimes it was 30 percent underpriced. Even if there had been a 
logical reason for Royal Dutch to be worth more or less than 50 
­percent of Shell (and there wasn’t any that I could think of), there 
was certainly no reason why the excess or deficit should fluctuate 
wildly. Forty-six percent of the time, the mispricing was larger than

10 percent; 18 percent of the time, the mispricing was larger than 20 
percent.
In theory, arbitragers could have profited handsomely from this 
mispricing, and their arbitrage trades should have eliminated the 
mispricing. When Royal Dutch traded at a premium to the 1.5 ratio, 
an arbitrager could have bought Shell stock and sold Royal Dutch 
stock short, betting on the premium disappearing, and these pur-
chases of Shell and short sales of Royal Dutch should have helped 
the premium vanish.
This is exactly what one hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Man-
agement, did in 1997, when the premium was 8 to 10 percent. Long-
Term bought $1.15 billion of Shell stock, sold $1.15 billion of Royal 
Dutch stock short, and waited for the market to correct. Long-Term 
was run by an all-star management team, including two finance pro-
fessors who won Nobel prizes in 1997, and its Royal Dutch/Shell 
hedge was a smart bet based on persuasive logic, not just statistical 
patterns that may have been coincidental and meaningless. The 
ratio of the market values should go to 1.5 eventually and Long-Term 
would profit from its smart hedge.
However, as Keynes observed during the Great Depression:
This long run is a misleading guide to current affairs. In the 
long run we are all dead. Economists set themselves too easy, 
too useless a task if in tempestuous seasons they can only 
tell us that when the storm is past the ocean is flat again.
Keynes was mocking the belief that, in the long run, the economy 
will be calm and everyone who wants a job will have a job. Keynes 
believed that the storm of an economic recession is more important 
than a hypothetical long run that no one will ever live to see. It is the 
same in finance. Trades that might be profitable in the long run can 
be disastrous in the short run.
Long-Term’s net worth at the beginning of 1998 was nearly $5 bil-
lion. In August, an unforeseen storm hit. Russia defaulted on its 
debt and perceived measures of risk rose throughout financial mar-

Special Opportunities      237
kets. Long-Term had placed bets in many different markets, but an 
awful lot of them were bets that risk premiums would decline. After 
the Russian default, risk premiums rose everywhere, and Long-Term 
was in trouble—big trouble.
Long-Term argued that all it needed was time for financial mar-
kets to return to normal—for the storm to pass and the ocean to be-
come flat again—but Long-Term didn’t have time. Its tremendous 
leverage created enormous losses. Long-Term lost $550 million on 
August 21, 1998, and $2.1 billion for the entire month, which was 
nearly half its net worth.
Long-Term tried to raise more money so that it could wait out 
the storm, but frightened lenders didn’t want to lend it more money. 
They wanted their money back.
Keynes was not only a master economist; he was also a legendary 
investor. Remember his observation: “Markets can remain irrational 
longer than you can remain solvent.” Perhaps markets overreacted 
to the Russian default. Perhaps Long-Term’s losses would have 
turned into profits eventually. But it couldn’t stay solvent long 
enough to find out.
Long-Term Capital Management had to close its Royal Dutch/
Shell position, and unfortunately, the Royal Dutch premium, in-
stead of declining, had gone above 20 percent and Long-Term lost 
$150 million. 
On September 23, 1998, Warren Buffett faxed Long-Term a one-
page letter offering to buy the firm for $250 million, roughly 5 percent 
of its value at the beginning of the year. The offer was take it or leave 
it and would expire at 12:30 p.m., about an hour after the fax had been 
sent. The deadline passed and the funeral preparations began.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York feared that the domino 
effect of a Long-Term default would trigger a global financial crisis. 
The Federal Reserve and Long-Term’s creditors took over the hedge 
fund and liquidated its assets. The creditors got their money back, 
Long-Term’s founding partners lost $1.9 billion, and other investors 
got an expensive lesson in the power of leverage.

238      MONEY MACHINE
Notice in Figure 15-4 that premium did disappear eventually, 
when the companies merged in 2005, with the Royal Dutch share-
holders getting 60 percent of the shares in the combined company 
and Shell shareholders getting 40 percent.
The Royal Dutch/Shell mispricing is compelling evidence that 
Mr. Market’s prices are sometimes wacky. Whatever the “correct” 
value of Shell stock, Royal Dutch was worth exactly 50 percent 
more, yet Mr. Market quoted prices sometimes higher and other 
times lower. This example also demonstrates how arbitrage does not 
necessarily eliminate mispricings and how arbitrage can be risky, 
even if done correctly by the best and brightest investors. An aca-
demic study of a dozen comparable arbitrage situations found that 
in many cases the mispricing lasted for several years and worsened 
before it improved.
Personally, I learned of the Royal Dutch/Shell mispricing in the 
early 1990s, but I never took a hedged position—partly because of 
the risk and partly because of my (perhaps irrational) dislike of short 
sales. I also never invested in Royal Dutch Petroleum or Shell Trans-
port—though, if I had, I would have picked the one that was cheaper.
The main lesson for value investors is simple. Some aficionados 
of the efficient market hypothesis believe that stock markets can be 
trusted to set the correct prices—and that investors should accept 
these prices as the best estimates of what a stock is really worth. 
Balderdash! It is hard to disprove their fanciful claim for most stocks 
because we don’t know for certain what a stock is really worth. The 
Royal Dutch/Shell example is one case where we do know exactly 
what Royal Dutch stock was worth in comparison to Shell stock—
and we know that market prices were wrong, by a substantial amount 
and for a long period of time.
The fact that Mr. Market’s prices are sometimes silly and usually 
too volatile means that value investors can take advantage of Mr. 
Market’s fickleness. However, value investors should still ask them-
selves if they know something Mr. Market doesn’t know. Value in-
vestors should not buy Apple stock just because iPhone sales 

Special Opportunities      239
increased, since other investors surely know that, too. But value in-
vestors should not be intimidated by arguments—even from Nobel 
laureates—that market prices are the best estimates of what stocks 
are worth.
UNILEVER
Unilever was created in 1930 by the merger of the Dutch company 
Margarine Unie and the British company Lever Brothers—hence 
the name Unilever. The Dutch company made margarine and the 
British company made soap, and both products are made with palm 
oil, so it made sense to join forces and negotiate lower prices for im-
ported palm oil. Today, Unilever is one of the world’s largest con-
sumer-goods companies, with more than 400 brands, including Axe/
Lynx fragrances, Dove toiletries, Hellmann’s mayonnaise, and Lip-
ton tea.
The 1930 merger maintained two separate companies that are 
treated as equals: Unilever NV, headquartered in Rotterdam, and 
Unilever PLC, headquartered in London. The two companies have 
the same CEO and board of directors. The shareholders have the 
same rights and are paid the same dividends.
Both companies have the same intrinsic value, yet the market 
prices of their stocks sometimes diverge.
Figure 15-5 shows the ratio of the price of Unilever PLC to ­Unilever 
NV back to 1960, when both stocks were traded on the New York 
Stock Exchange. Up until the 1980s, the mispricing was as­tounding. 
Eighty-seven percent of the time, the mispricing was larger than  
10 percent; 53 percent of the time, the mispricing was larger than 20 
­percent. Figure 15-5 shows that the mispricing often lasted years and 
got worse before it got better, though the mispricing has been smaller 
in recent years.

240      MONEY MACHINE
FIGURE 15-5. Unilever PLC vs. Unilever NV
(Even if there is some overlooked reason why one company is 
worth more than the other, the company’s stock should consistently 
reflect this advantage. For example, if Unilever PLC was worth 5 
percent more than Unilever NV, the ratio of their market values 
should always be 1.05, not sometimes 1.7 and other times 0.6.)
Like the Royal Dutch/Shell mispricing, this example is more in-
disputable evidence that markets do not invariably set “correct” 
prices, in any meaningful sense of the word. No matter what the in-
trinsic value of Unilever PLC, the intrinsic value of Unilever NV is 
identical. If the stock market sets different prices for these two 
stocks, at least one price does not equal intrinsic value. Most likely, 
neither price is equal to intrinsic value.
As with the Royal Dutch/Shell mispricing, I never tried to arbi-
trage the Unilever mispricing by buying one stock and shorting the 
other. I have invested in Unilever—always choosing whichever stock 
was cheaper at the time.

INVESTING IN YOUR HOME
Buy land, they’re not making it anymore.
—Mark Twain
B
ill grew up in Porterville, a small town in California’s great 
Central Valley. He was valedictorian of his high school class of 
twelve students. Bette grew up in Indio, a small California desert 
town that was perhaps best known for its annual date festival, which 
features camel races and a surprising variety of foods made with 
dates—including date ice cream.
Bill and Bette married in 1942 and bought their first home in 
1946: a 900-square-foot, two-bedroom home, 100 yards from a rail-
road track in a modest suburban community that was close to Bill’s 
job in Southern California’s aerospace industry. They paid $4,000 
for this home with a $500 down payment and a $3,500 mortgage.
By 1954, they had four children, the oldest age nine, a three-year-
old, a one-year-o1d, and a newborn. They needed a bigger home and 
Bill’s growing salary allowed them to afford one. They bought a 
three-bedroom, two-bath tract home in La Habra, another quiet 
Southern California town. They sold their first home for $8,000 and 
paid $13,000 for their new home.
They raised their family in this home until their children were 
grown and Bill and Bette had grown tired of how crowded and con-
gested Southern California had become—not at all like their child-
hoods in Porterville and Indio. In 1990, Bill retired and they sold 

242      MONEY MACHINE
their La Habra home and bought a condominium on Golf Course 
Road in Thatcher, Arizona. Bill taught at the local community col-
lege and played golf almost every day; Bette took photography 
classes at the community college and took pictures of Arizona’s nat-
ural beauty.
Bill’s pension from his aerospace employer, his Social Security 
payments, and the money they netted from selling their La Habra 
home and buying a home in Thatcher provided them with a secure, 
comfortable retirement.
Their lifetime of homeownership turned a $500 investment into 
a comfortable retirement nest egg. In addition, the rent they saved 
every year for decades paid for college for all four of their children. 
Their home was the best investment they ever made. I know be-
cause they were my parents.
THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF A HOME
The biggest investment that many people will ever make is the 
house they live in, yet they don’t think of their home as an invest-
ment. Homes aren’t like stocks. Homes are just where we happen to 
live, right? Nope. A home is an investment just like stocks.
Stocks pay dividends. What is the income from a home? A New 
York Times writer couldn’t figure it out. He said that “houses have no 
underlying revenue stream (such as a stock’s corporate earnings) on 
which to base an assumption of true value.” He was completely and 
utterly wrong. Homes do have income. It’s subtle, but it’s absolutely 
crucial for understanding how a home can be valued the same way as 
stocks.
For a landlord, the income is obvious—the monthly rent check 
from the tenants. If you own your home, there is income, too, but it 
is harder to see because no one gives you a check each month. The 
income is the rent you don’t have to pay. If you rent a home for $1,500 
a month, this money goes out of your bank account and into your 

Investing in Your Home      243
landlord’s account. If you own your home, $1,500 doesn’t leave your 
bank account. This $1,500 is not theoretical. It is real dollars that 
you can use for food, clothing, and entertainment. This $1,500 is in-
come from your home.
Home buyers don’t usually think this way. Some homeowners 
consider their home a “necessary expense,” like food and clothing. 
They figure their home is worth what other homes are selling for 
(what are called comps). If a similar house sold for $400,000, that’s 
what their home is worth. That’s like saying that stocks are a neces-
sary expense and a stock is worth what similar stocks sell for. Value 
investors know better.
A second, very different type of home buyer thinks real estate is 
a speculative road to riches. They buy homes to “flip” a short while 
later for a profit, the way stock traders count on a line of greater 
fools. They are too quick to assume that however fast home prices 
have gone up in the past, they will continue doing so in the future. 
They think they can buy a house for $400,000 and sell it a few 
months later for $450,000. Money for nothing. Value investors 
know better.
IF I BOUGHT IT, IT MUST BE WORTH  
WHAT I PAID
Some financial advisers view residential housing as a foolproof in-
vestment that does not require financial analysis. A former manag-
ing director at Salomon Brothers argued that “there is no bad time 
to buy.” A prolific real estate author and professor was only slightly 
more restrained, stating that “90 to 95 percent of people [who buy a 
house] will say it is the best investment I ever made.”
Humorist Will Rogers seconded Mark Twain’s argument when he 
offered this tempting reason for optimism: “Don’t wait to buy land. 
Buy land and wait, the good Lord ain’t makin’ any more of it.” The 
same argument could be made about anything with a fixed ­supply, 

244      MONEY MACHINE
including many things that would not be taken seriously as invest-
ments, including Lisa computers, Chrysler New Yorkers, and last 
year’s clothing fashions. (If you don’t know what a Lisa computer or 
Chrysler New Yorker is, that makes my point.)
George and Mary Parker learned this lesson another way. The 
Parkers live in Naples, Florida, a small city on the southeastern coast 
of Florida. The Naples beach has been voted the best beach in the 
United States, and the town itself boasts that it has more golf 
courses, millionaires, and CEOs per capita than any other city in the 
country. After the dot-com stock market crash, the Parkers sold 
their stocks and started investing in real estate by buying small Na-
ples homes in older neighborhoods on the wrong side of the high-
way—away from the beach.
Home prices in Naples more than doubled between 2001 and 
2005 and, along the way, the Parkers made a lot of money flipping 
homes. They bought their first Naples property in 2001 for $180,000, 
with a $30,000 down payment and a $150,000 mortgage. They made 
some cosmetic repairs and sold it nine months later for $210,000. 
They used the profits to buy two similar homes, which they sold in 
less than a year. By 2005, they owned thirteen homes, all very much 
like the first home they bought in 2001. In fact, they bought one 
home in 2002, sold it in 2003, and bought it back again in 2005 for 
twice what they had paid in 2002. Sometimes they rented their 
homes to help make the mortgage payments; other times, they 
flipped a home before they had time to find a tenant.
The Naples housing market weakened in 2006 and the easy flip-
ping ended. The Parkers’ rental income didn’t cover their mortgage 
payments and buyers weren’t lining up to buy homes. The Parkers 
tried to sell one home through a real estate auction, but the highest 
bid was 30 percent less than the price they had paid. The Parkers re-
fused to accept this bid or to consider the possibility that they had 
paid too much. George argued that the prices they paid were okay 
because appraisers valued the homes at close to their purchase 
prices.

Investing in Your Home      245
Where did the appraisers’ numbers come from? From comps, of 
course. The house they bought in 2002 and repurchased in 2005 was 
appraised at $220,000 in 2002 and at $450,000 in 2005 because 
that’s what similar houses were selling for in 2002 and 2005. These 
appraisals didn’t mean that the house was actually worth $220,000 
in 2002 and $450,000 in 2005. A Beanie Baby wasn’t worth $500 be-
cause some fool paid $500 for it. A dot-com stock wasn’t worth 
$1,000 because some fool paid $1,000 for it. A Naples rental prop-
erty wasn’t worth $450,000 because the Parkers paid $450,000 for 
it. A home isn’t worth $450,000 unless it generates enough income 
to justify the price. The Parkers’ properties didn’t.
THE HOME DIVIDEND
Peter Lynch, the legendary mutual fund manager, wrote:
Because of leverage, if you buy a $100,000 house for 20 per-
cent down and the value of the house increases by 5 percent 
a year, you are making a 25 percent return on your down 
­payment.
This fixation with price appreciation is horribly misleading. It is 
very much like buying a stock because you think the price is going 
up. That’s what speculators do, but not value investors—either in 
the stock market or the real estate market. Value investors think 
about the income from stock and real estate.
Some people recognize that because we have the option of buy-
ing or renting, we should compare monthly rent with monthly mort-
gage payments. For example, in its 2002 housing report, the Harvard 
Joint Center for Housing Studies estimated that the average renter 
paid $481 per month while the buyer of the median single-family 
home paid an $821 monthly mortgage payment. This is another of 
those apples-and-oranges comparisons that is only superficially rel-
evant. The average rental property may be much smaller than the 

246      MONEY MACHINE
median home, and in a different place, too. The three most impor-
tant things in real estate are location, location, location. We need to 
compare the cost of buying or renting the same property, not the 
cost of renting a two-bedroom apartment in Detroit with the cost 
of buying a four-bedroom home in Atlanta.
A 2005 article in Fortune magazine did a better job by using a real 
example:
[The Olsons] crunched a few numbers. This time they de-
cided to rent—and they’re saving a bundle. For $2,350 a 
month, they have a four-bedroom, 2,100-square-foot home. 
If they were to purchase that same home today for $700,000 
(the going rate for a similar home in the neighborhood), the 
monthly payment on a thirty-year, $630,000 mortgage at 6.1 
percent would run them more than $3,800.
However, this analysis is flawed too. The monthly mortgage pay-
ment depends on the down payment and the length of the mort-
gage. Suppose, for an extreme example, you pay cash for a house and 
have no mortgage payments. Is buying therefore guaranteed to be 
better than renting?
In addition, Fortune neglects the fact that the interest portion of 
the mortgage payment is tax-deductible and omits property taxes, 
insurance, and maintenance expenses. It also ignores the fact that 
rents will probably increase over time, while mortgage payments are 
constant and then end when the loan is repaid.
Just like stocks, think of a home as a money machine and esti-
mate the cash coming out of the machine. The income that a home 
generates is the rent a homeowner would otherwise have to pay a 
landlord. There are expenses, too. Homeowners make mortgage 
payments and pay property taxes, homeowner’s insurance, and 
maintenance expenses when a faucet drips and the walls need to be 
repainted. A home’s net income is the difference between the in-
come and expenses. Because this net income is as real as the divi-
dends from a stock portfolio, I call it the home dividend. 

Investing in Your Home      247
There are surely nonfinancial considerations that make renting 
and owning different. Renters might not like the pumpkin-orange 
walls the landlord picked out. Renters don’t get any financial 
­benefit from remodeling a kitchen or landscaping a yard. Renters 
might have less privacy than homeowners. These are all arguments 
for why owning is better than renting and, to the extent they mat-
ter, why home-dividend calculations underestimate the value of 
­home­ownership.
It is not true that you can’t go wrong buying a home. The claim 
by the former Salomon Brothers director that “there is no bad time 
to buy” is embarrassingly silly. Everything has a price that is too low 
and a price that is too high. An apple is a bargain at a penny and too 
expensive at $100. The question for value investors is whether the 
home dividend makes the price a bargain or a mistake. It is the same 
question value investors ask about stocks.
A HOME IN FISHERS, INDIANA
Let’s look at a very specific example. In the summer of 2005, a three-
bedroom, three-bathroom, 1,917-square-foot house in Fishers, Indi-
ana, was purchased for $135,000 with a 20 percent down payment 
($27,000) and a thirty-year mortgage. Fishers is an attractive India-
napolis suburb. The median family income is over $100,000 and 
Money magazine ranked Fishers among the top 50 places to live in 
the United States in 2005, 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012.
I estimated the home dividend by making a list of the financial 
benefits and expenses from homeownership—the cash going in and 
the cash going out. Table 16-1 shows the estimated values for the 
first year. The details are explained in the Appendix at the end of 
this chapter.

The biggest benefit is the rent saving; the biggest expense is the 
mortgage payment. 
The bottom line is a first-year home dividend of $5,622. After one 
year, the homeowners will have $5,622 more in their bank account 
than they would have if they were renting. Just like a stock portfolio 
that pays a $5,622 dividend, this $5,622 is their home dividend.
Is $5,622 a good return on their investment? As with stocks, we 
should compare the dividend with the size of the investment. When 
you buy a home, your investment is the cash you put up for the 
down payment and closing costs. Here, the down payment is 
$27,000. We’ll add $3,000 in closing costs to make it an even $30,000 
investment. They invested $30,000, which they could otherwise 
have invested in stocks. The $5,622 first-year home dividend is a 19 
percent after-tax rate of return on their investment! Where else 
could they invest $30,000 and get a $5,622 dividend the first year?
The home dividend will get bigger each year because rents will 
increase, but the mortgage payments won’t (if it is a fixed-rate mort-
gage). Let’s assume that rents, property taxes, insurance, and main-
tenance all grow by 3 percent a year. The home dividend will be 
$5,942 in the second year, $8,843 in the tenth year, $13,471 in the 
twentieth year, and $19,478 in the thirtieth year. Then the mortgage 
payments stop. The home dividend jumps to $27,744 in the thirty-
first year and keeps on growing. What a great investment!

Just like stocks, we can calculate the present value of the home 
dividends and compare this intrinsic value to the $30,000 cost. Fig-
ure 16-1 shows the intrinsic values for after-tax required returns up 
to 30 percent. The breakeven return is 23.8 percent. This home is an 
attractive investment for any after-tax required return below 23.8 
percent.
For an after-tax required return of, say, 10 percent, the present 
value of this $30,000 investment is $106,000. This is like buying a 
stock for $30 a share that is really worth $106. For an after-tax re-
quired return of 5 percent, it is like paying $30 for a stock worth 
$476. These are genuine $100 bills on the sidewalk.

­completely. Why is this home in the Fishers suburb such a great in-
vestment? Not because I assumed home prices will increase rapidly. 
I didn’t make any assumptions at all about home prices! Just like the 
intrinsic value analysis of a stock, I assumed that the home buyer 
never sells. All the value comes from the income generated by the 
investment. A home is a money machine just like stocks.
Too many homeowners focus on comps and price appreciation 
when they should instead be thinking about their home dividend. 
When you buy a home to live in, you get home dividends equal to 
your rent savings and tax benefits minus your mortgage payments 
and other expenses. In the Fishers example, you would have to earn 
a 23.8 percent after-tax return on a $30,000 stock investment to do 
as well. Where are you going to find another investment that gives 
you such a wonderful return? Where are you going to find an invest-
ment that gives you as much pleasure as the home you live in?
We can also calculate the future value of your investment if you 
buy the Fishers home and invest the annual home dividend in a 
stock portfolio paying a modest 5 percent after-tax return each year. 
After thirty years, you will have $668,379 and be living in your home 
rent-free and mortgage-free. After fifty years, you will have 
$2,948,642.
I haven’t said anything yet about how much home prices in-
crease. Now I will. Table 16-2 shows your total after-tax wealth, in-
vested home dividends plus the value of your home, if home prices 
increase by zero, 3 percent, or 5 percent a year over the next fifty 
years.

Even in the case of 5 percent annual price increases, most of the in-
crease in your wealth comes from the home dividends.
Price appreciation can certainly be an added bonus, but it isn’t 
the most persuasive reason for buying a home. Don’t buy a home be-
cause you think the price will be 10 percent higher a year from now. 
Do buy a home because you plan to live in it for a while and believe 
that it is cheaper to pay off a mortgage than to pay a landlord.
THE LONG VIEW
Suppose that you live in one area for sixty years. And suppose that 
you change houses every ten or fifteen years. You marry and divorce. 
You have children and your children grow up. You change jobs and 
so on. For whatever reasons, you might own four or five different 
homes during these sixty or so years. Annual ups and downs in home 
prices aren’t all that important. If you sell your home for a higher 
price than you paid for it, you will also pay a high price for your next 
home. If you sell your home when prices are low, you will also pay a 
low price for your next home. Over long horizons, the income you 
get from owning your home—your home dividend—will usually be 
much more important than zigs and zags in home prices.
Once you focus on years and years of home dividends, a home is 
not as unpredictable an investment as you might think. While buy-
ing a home might seem risky, not buying is risky, too. If you wait too 
long, you might get priced out of the market and have to pay rent for 
the rest of your life. Or think of it this way. You need a place to 
live—which you can pay for with rent or with mortgage payments. 
Which is riskier: making constant mortgage payments or making 
rent payments that can change every year?
Some people don’t consider their home to be part of their wealth. 
They say, “Everyone has to live somewhere.” Yes, everyone has to 
live somewhere. But you can choose to be a renter or an owner. A 
home is a place to live, but homeownership is an investment.

252      MONEY MACHINE
Others say, “But I will never sell my home and live in the street, 
so my home isn’t really valuable like stocks.” You don’t have to sell 
your stocks for them to be profitable investments. Their value comes 
from the cash they generate. The same is true of your home. Re-
member Warren Buffett’s advice: “I never attempt to make money 
on the stock market. I buy on the assumption that they could close 
the market the next day and not reopen it for five years.” Think 
about your home in the same way. Don’t try to predict home prices 
next week, next year, or five years from now. If it helps, assume that 
the real estate market closes after you buy your home.
Now you can focus on what really matters—the home dividend. 
If your mortgage payments (and other expenses) are less than what 
you would pay in rent, your home is paying you a monthly home div-
idend. When your mortgage is paid off, you will be living in a home 
with some relatively low expenses (such as property taxes and main-
tenance) and saving thousands of dollars in rent. All the money you 
don’t pay to a landlord is money that you can spend on food, cloth-
ing, entertainment, whatever you want. Yes, your home is valuable, 
like stocks, even if you never sell your home.
RENTAL PROPERTIES
Once you understand that the investment value of a home depends 
on the home dividend, you also know how to value rental properties. 
Buy a rental property for the income, not because you think the 
price will increase rapidly.
We’ve seen that the income from a home comes from the rent 
savings. If the rent savings are large enough to make a home a prof-
itable investment, then it would seem that buying the home and 
renting it to someone else will also be a profitable investment. This 
general idea is correct, but a few details complicate matters.
One detail is that when you buy a home and live in it, you save 
rent every single month. But if you buy a home and rent it out, you 

Investing in Your Home      253
only collect rent if you have tenants. If there is a gap between when 
one tenant moves out and the next tenant moves in, you lose rent 
while the home is vacant. You also lose rent if tenants refuse to pay 
and it takes a while to evict them.
Your maintenance expenses might also increase. If you live in 
your own home and have a leaky faucet, you can just slip in a new 
washer. If you are a landlord and the property is not close by, you 
might have to pay a plumber $75 to slip in a washer. Also, people 
who own the house they live in are more likely to take good care of 
it. People living in a stranger’s home are more likely to be careless or 
destructive. So your maintenance expenses are likely to be larger if 
you rent a home to someone else than if you live in it yourself. Fi-
nally, the tax rules are different for owner-occupied homes than for 
rental properties.
ADVERSE SELECTION
Adverse selection occurs when high-risk people take advantage of 
deals intended for low-risk people. For example, if life insurance 
companies cannot distinguish those in poor health from those in 
good health, it must offer the same premium to both. Those in poor 
health are more likely to buy such policies and file claims, and this 
reduces the insurance company’s profits.
In the real estate market, an adverse-selection problem arises if 
people choose to rent because they believe they are likely to lose 
their job, are not handy around the home, are accident prone, or 
have unruly children and pets. I am not saying that these are univer-
sal traits, only that these characteristics might be more prevalent 
among renters. If they are, landlords might find themselves with 
tenants who are unemployed klutzes with destructive children and 
pets.

254      MONEY MACHINE
MORAL HAZARD
There is a moral hazard problem when a person behaves differently 
if someone else is paying the bills. For example, a person might be 
less concerned about the cost of medical tests if the insurance com-
pany pays for the tests.
In extreme cases, unscrupulous people crash insured automo-
biles and burn down insured buildings. There’s even a joke that goes 
like this: Two friends meet each other unexpectedly at a European 
resort. The first person explains that he bought a warehouse and it 
burned down; he is using the insurance proceeds to pay for his vaca-
tion. The second person responds that he bought a building that 
was destroyed by a flood and that he, too, is spending the insurance 
money on a vacation. “Gee,” the first person asks, “how do you start 
a flood?”
Deliberately causing damage to collect insurance is illegal. But it 
is not illegal to be less careful. In the real estate market, it seems 
self-evident that most people will take better care of a home if they 
own it than if they rent it. Some friends of mine learned this lesson 
the hard way. They rented out their Vermont home while they spent 
a year in Scotland with relatives. Their tenants piled mattresses in 
the front yard so that their children could jump off the roof, roasted 
marshmallows around a campfire on the living room floor, and 
ripped a bathroom sink out of the wall and took it with them when 
they moved out. Would these tenants have done any of these things 
to their own home?
That story is real. The next is a joke (I hope). Jack lives in New 
Hampshire and his heating bills have skyrocketed. Seeing all the 
trees around him, he realizes that he can heat his home by burning 
logs. One day, he calls his friend Mack to come over and bring an ax 
and a chain saw. Jack found an old oil drum at the town dump and 
wants to put it in the basement. The drum won’t fit through the cel-
lar door, so Jack uses the ax to cut some posts and widen the open-
ing. Once the drum is in the basement, the plan is to burn logs in the 

Investing in Your Home      255
drum and let the heat rise to warm the house. The next problem is 
how to get the heat from the basement into the house. No problem. 
Jack also found an old heating grate at the dump. He walks into the 
living room, traces an outline of the grate on the wooden floor, and 
then uses the chain saw to cut a slightly smaller hole that the grate 
can rest on. He nails the grate in place with two-by-fours. Problem 
solved. No one will fall through the hole in the floor and the heat 
from the burning logs will warm the house nicely. Mack admires 
Jack’s ingenuity, but asks what the insurance company will think of 
this heating system.
Jack replies, “Insurance? That’s the owner’s problem!”
LONG-DISTANCE LANDLORDS
My wife and I live in Southern California, where home prices make 
homes in many other parts of the country look like irresistible in-
vestments. As in the Fishers example, home prices are so low rela-
tive to the home dividend that buying a home to live in has a 
double-digit after-tax return.
This wasn’t a temporary aberration. We looked at decades of data 
and found homes to be attractively priced for many years in many 
parts of the heartland. In the Indianapolis area, homes were a good 
investment twenty-five years ago and have become an even better 
investment over time. Rising rents and falling mortgage rates have 
increased home dividends greatly, while home prices have risen by a 
leisurely 2.2 percent a year. The average Indianapolis home that we 
looked at in 2005 cost $14,000 a year to rent but could be bought 
for only $146,000. People who are going to live in Indianapolis for 
many years can almost surely look forward to a very rewarding re-
turn from buying a home there.
When my wife and I saw these stacks of $100 bills, we looked 
into becoming long-distance landlords, buying single-family homes 
in Indianapolis, Atlanta, Dallas, and many other parts of the ­country 

256      MONEY MACHINE
and renting them to local residents. But the closer we looked, the 
less attractive this idea appeared. We would have to research the 
neighborhoods and fly out to look at the homes before buying them. 
We would have to pay someone to screen prospective tenants and 
keep an eye on the houses. We would have to pay someone to do 
home repairs. (It doesn’t make sense to fly to In­dianapolis to replace 
a washer!) Property management companies will take care of most 
of the details, but their fees are typically 5 to 10 percent of the rent. 
We would also need to deal with vacancies, unpaid rent, and damage 
to the property. The costs just kept piling up.
In addition, the income kept shrinking. If you own your own 
home, you get lots of tax breaks that landlords do not get. Most 
important, a landlord’s rent is taxable income, but homeowners 
don’t pay taxes on the rent they save by living in their own homes. 
Expenses are also handled differently, and the proverbial bottom 
line is that the prospective after-tax income is generally much 
lower when buying a home to rent than when buying the same 
home to live in.
FISHERS, INDIANA, AGAIN
Let’s look again at the three-bedroom, three-bath house in Fishers, 
Indiana. Table 16-1 showed that the homeowners’ estimated first-
year home dividend was $5,622. Let’s see what the home dividend 
would be if this home had been rented to someone else for $15,000 
a year.
Table 16-3 shows the income and expenses. The details are 
­explained in this chapter’s Appendix. The home dividend is much 
smaller for a landlord than for someone who buys the house to live 
in.

The biggest factors that cut into the home dividend are:
1.	 Many states, including Indiana, levy higher property taxes on 
rental properties than on owner-occupied homes.
2.	 Landlords do not receive a tax saving from mortgage interest 
and property taxes because these must be used (together 
with depreciation and other expenses) to avoid paying taxes 
on the rental income. Owner occupiers do not have to give 
up their tax saving because their rent savings are not consid-
ered taxable income. They can consequently use mortgage 
interest and property taxes to reduce the taxes they pay on 
their other income.
The landlord numbers in Table 16-3 might be too optimistic. I 
initially assumed that the maintenance expenses are $1,350, regard-
less of whether the buyer lives in the home or rents it out. I used the 
same maintenance expense for each case because I wanted to focus 
on how the home dividend is affected by the different tax rules for 
owner-occupied homes and rental properties.
In practice, the maintenance costs are probably going to be 
higher if the home is rented. Table 16-4 shows that if the ­maintenance 

258      MONEY MACHINE
expenses are doubled, from $1,350 to $2,700, the home dividend 
falls from $1,952 to $602. The home dividend is almost gone!

If we allow for slightly higher maintenance expenses and/or months 
when the home is vacant, the home dividend can turn negative. This 
home might still be attractive as a rental property because we are 
only looking at the first-year home dividend, and the home dividend 
is likely to improve over time as rents increase and mortgage pay-
ments do not. The point is simply that the home dividend can be a 
lot lower for a rental property than for an owner-occupied home.
There are two lessons. First, just like the home you live in, the in-
vestment value of a rental property depends on the home dividend. 
Second, a home can look a lot more financially attractive if you are 
buying a home to live in than if you are buying the home so that you 
can rent it to someone else.

FIRST-YEAR HOME DIVIDEND IN FISHERS
T

dend for the home in Fishers, Indiana, both as an owner-­
occupied home or rental property.

Here is where these numbers came from.
Rent. It cost $1,250 a month ($15,000 a year) to rent a comparable 
house. This is the rent savings for a homeowner, the rental income 
for a landlord.
Mortgage payment. In the summer of 2005, the interest rate on a 
thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 5.7 percent, and the mortgage 
payments were $626.83 a month, or $7,522 a year.

260      MONEY MACHINE
Property tax. In Indiana, property-tax rates are set each year to 
raise enough revenue to pay for government spending. I estimated 
that the tax rate on this home would be 2.7 percent. Indiana resi-
dents are eligible for a $3,000 homeowner exemption if they have a 
mortgage. They are also eligible for a homeowner exemption of 
$35,000 or half the value of the house, whichever is less, if the home 
is the owner’s primary residence. The 2.7 percent tax is levied on the 
difference between the assessed value and homeowner exemptions: 
0.027 ($135,000 – $3,000 – $35,000) = $2,619. Rental properties and 
vacation homes are not eligible for the larger exemption. So, a land-
lord pays a property tax of 0.027 ($135,000 – $3,000) = $3,564.
Tax savings. Of the $7,522 in mortgage payments made the first 
year, $6,120 is interest on the loan and $1,402 is a partial repayment 
of the amount borrowed. Homeowners can include the $6,120 in in-
terest and the $2,619 in property taxes as itemized deductions on 
their federal income tax return. In a 28 percent federal income tax 
bracket, this saves 0.28 ($6,120 + $2,619) = $2,447 in federal income 
taxes.
Indiana residents do not deduct mortgage interest from their 
state taxable income, but they are allowed to deduct up to $2,500 of 
either property taxes or rent from taxable income. Here, the home-
owners would be able to deduct $2,500 either way, so there is no net 
gain or loss in their state income taxes from owning a home instead 
of renting. (As explained at the end of this appendix, there is no 
state or federal tax liability or benefit for landlords.)
Insurance. The annual cost of homeowner’s insurance is $508; if 
the owners were renting, they would pay $174 for renter’s insurance. 
The difference is $508 – $174 = $334. For a landlord, the cost of 
rental-property insurance is $612.
Utilities. I assumed that the homeowners would incur the same ex-
penses for their telephone, electricity, gas, and other utilities if they 

Appendix to Chapter 16       261
were renting. So, there is no difference here between buying and 
renting, and there is no cost for the landlord.
Maintenance. I estimated the homeowner’s annual maintenance 
expenses to be one percent of the value of the house: 0.01 ($135,000) 
= $1,350. The expense is probably higher if the owner rents the home 
out instead of living in it. Nonetheless, I initially assumed that the 
maintenance expense is the same for both so that we can focus on 
how the home dividend is affected by the fact that the tax laws are 
different if the owner lives in the home or rents it out.
Adding up all the entries, the bottom line is a home dividend of 
$5,622 for a homeowner and $1,952 for a landlord.
A LANDLORD’S TAXES
If you live in your own home, you do not pay taxes on the implicit 
income—your rent savings. If you rent the home to someone else, 
you may have to pay taxes on the rental income minus expenses. So 
we need to list the tax-deductible expenses and calculate the taxes 
(if any) that need to be paid. These calculations are shown in Table 
16-6.

The interest portion of mortgage payments is tax-deductible. Of 
the $7,522 in mortgage payments made the first year, $6,120 is inter-
est. The other expenses are the same as in Table 16-5. In addition, a 
landlord is allowed to claim a depreciation expense for the structure 
(but not for the land) because the structure will eventually wear out, 
but the land presumably won’t. I assume the value of the structure is 
equal to 75 percent of the total value: 0.75 ($135,000) = $101,250. I 
depreciate the structure straight line over 27.5 years, which means 
that the structure is assumed to last 27.5 years and to lose 3.636 per-
cent of its initial value each year: 100/27.5 = 0.03636. The annual de-
preciation expense is consequently 0.03636 ($101,250) = $3,682.
Adding up all the entries, there is a loss for tax purposes. People 
who are not real estate professionals typically cannot deduct rental 
losses against other income because the rental property would then 
be a tax shelter rather than a real business. (There is a “small inves-
tor” exception because the law is intended to curtail the use of rental 
properties as tax shelters by wealthy persons.) Notice that the land-
lord’s home dividend in Table 16-5 is positive even though there is a 
loss for tax purposes. This is one reason why the government is con-
cerned about the use of rental properties as tax shelters.

AFTERWORD 
SUMMING IT UP
O
verheard a seductive stock tip?  Saw a story about a cool 
product or a hot stock? Quick payoffs are fool’s gold. To 
make money in the market, you need to think about stocks differ-
ently, not as get-rich-quick schemes, but as Money Machines.  
Investing in the stock market doesn’t have to be reckless specula-
tion—gambling on guesses about zigs and zags in stock prices. You 
can become a value investor by forming your own opinions about 
what stocks are really worth, and taking advantage of the market’s 
fickle nature. Where others see risks, you can see opportunities.
Value investing is the secret to the success of Benjamin Graham, 
Warren Buffett, and other legendary investors. It can be your secret, 
too.
MONEY MACHINES
It’s all about the cash. Resist the temptation to base your invest-
ment decisions on guesses about Mr. Market’s prices. Don’t buy 
stocks foolishly at inflated prices, hoping to sell to even bigger fools 
at still higher prices.
Instead, think of investments as money machines and think 
about what you would be willing to pay for the cash they generate 
over an indefinite horizon. If you are right about the cash, you will 
be happy with the investment, no matter what Mr. Market says.

264      MONEY MACHINE
EASY MONEY?
Get-rich-quick schemes are inherently suspect. If they worked, the 
promoter would be using the scheme instead of peddling it. Be skep-
tical of hot tips. They are usually false or, if true, already reflected in 
the price.
The efficient market hypothesis says that market prices take into 
account all relevant information so that no investor can take advan-
tage of other people’s ignorance. There is wisdom in the observation 
that it will never be clear that a stock’s price is about to surge or col-
lapse—for if it were obvious, there would not be a balance between 
buyers and sellers.
Stock prices reflect investor expectations and will not rise or fall 
when things that are expected to happen do happen. Stock prices 
will change if the unexpected happens. However, by definition, it is 
impossible to predict the unexpected. Therefore, the argument 
goes, it is impossible to predict changes in stock prices. Value inves-
tors do not try to predict blips and dips in stock prices, but we all 
should remember that what everyone knows isn’t worth knowing. 
The true benchmark for gauging your investment ideas is not how 
today differs from yesterday or how tomorrow will differ from today, 
but how tomorrow will differ from what others expect.
MR. MARKET IS NOT ALWAYS RIGHT
Some efficient-market enthusiasts argue that the fact that changes 
in stock prices are difficult to predict proves that the stock market 
always sets the correct prices, the prices that God herself would set. 
However, stock prices may be difficult to predict because of unpre-
dictable, sometimes irrational, revisions in investor expectations—
as if God determined stock prices by flipping a coin. If so, market 
prices are hard to predict, but are not good estimates of intrinsic 
value.

Afterword       265
Stock prices are sometimes wacky. During speculative booms 
and financial crises, the stock market leaves suitcases full of $100 
bills on the sidewalk. Still, when you think you have found an easy 
way to make money, ask yourself if other investors have overlooked 
a $100 bill on the sidewalk or if you have overlooked a logical expla-
nation.
If a stock’s price goes down after you buy it, think about whether 
there is a good reason for this dip or if it is just noise. If there is a 
good reason, consider harvesting the tax benefits by selling the 
stock. If the price drop is noise, this is an opportunity to buy more 
shares at an even better price.
PROCESSING INFORMATION
Possessing information is knowing something that others do not 
know. Processing information is thinking more clearly about things 
that are well known. This distinction is important because even if 
stock prices take into account sales, profits, interest rates, and other 
relevant facts, prices may be distorted by common human errors in 
processing information. The stock market is only semi-efficient. 
Three examples are confusing a great company with a great stock, 
hot tips, and chasing trends.
Some investors are more skilled than lucky. However, the perva-
sive unpredictability of stock prices makes it hard to separate the 
truly talented from the lucky and the liars. The stock market is not 
all luck, but it is more luck than nervous investors want to hear or 
successful investors want to admit.
It is tempting to think that, as in any profession, good training, 
hard work, and a skilled mind will yield superior results. It is tempt-
ing to think that you are one of the gifted. You are not alone! Very 
few investors think they are below average, even though half are. 
After all, who would sell one stock and buy another if they thought 
they would be wrong more often than right? Being human, we count 

266      MONEY MACHINE
every profitable decision as a confirmation of our wisdom. We blame 
every mistake on bad luck or the irrationality of other investors.
This overconfidence is why so many investors jump in and out of 
stocks, believing they know more than investors on the other side of 
their trades. It is why so many investors hold so few stocks, believ-
ing that their picks are destined to succeed. It is why so many inves-
tors won’t sell their losers, despite the tax benefits, believing that 
other investors will eventually agree that these are great stocks.
PATTERNS
In any set of data, even randomly generated data, it is possible to 
find patterns if one looks long enough. Ransacking data for patterns 
demonstrates little more than persistence: “If you torture the data 
long enough, it will confess.”
It is not surprising that investors and computers can discover 
rules that explain the past remarkably well, but are unsuccessful in 
predicting the future. If there is no underlying reason for the discov-
ered pattern, there is no reason for the pattern to persist. Value in-
vestors do not try to predict stock prices, so they do not waste time 
looking for patterns and they are not tempted by patterns they hap-
pen to notice.
HIGH HOPES
In a Ponzi scheme, money from new investors is paid to earlier ones. 
The insurmountable problem is that the number of new investors 
needed to keep a Ponzi scheme going multiplies too rapidly to be 
sustained. Ponzi schemes are an example of the useful principle that 
investments that sound too good to be true probably aren’t true.
Speculative bubbles are like Ponzi schemes in that they are fu-
eled by wishful thinking that cannot continue indefinitely. Prices 

Afterword       267
climb higher and higher, beyond reason, in that nothing justifies the 
rising prices except the hope that prices will keep going up. Then 
the bubble pops, buyers vanish, and prices collapse.
Some people do not think that bubbles are possible. Since mar-
kets always set the correct prices, whatever prices markets set must 
be correct. It is hard to take this circular argument seriously. A bub-
ble exists when rising prices cannot be justified by an asset’s intrin-
sic value. This is clearly true of collectibles like Beanie Babies that 
have no intrinsic value. It is also true of stocks that do not generate 
enough cash to justify their market prices, but are instead being 
bought so that they can be sold.
Value investors resist bubbles because they are not counting on 
selling their stocks at higher prices. Value investors are sellers, not 
buyers, during speculative bubbles (and buyers during panics).
INTRINSIC VALUE
A stock’s intrinsic value is the present value of its dividends if the 
stock were held forever. Even though we don’t live forever, let alone 
hold stocks forever, this perspective forces us to think about the 
cash that companies generate instead of guessing whether the mar-
ket price tomorrow will be higher or lower than today’s price.
The two main economic drivers of the stock market are the prof-
its that companies generate and the interest rates used to discount 
these profits. Remember that if you are trying to predict which di-
rection stock prices are headed based on predictions about the 
economy and interest rates, what matters is how your predictions 
differ from the predictions already embedded in stock prices. For 
example, it is not enough to predict that profits will increase; you 
need to predict whether profits will increase by more or less than 
the market expects. Value investors do not play this game because 
they are not trying to predict stock prices.
Companies that do not pay dividends can be valued using the 

268      MONEY MACHINE
Shiller, Bogle, and economic value added (EVA) models, though I 
am leery about investing in firms that do not pay dividends.
STOCK STRATEGIES
Instead of trying to predict short-term zigs and zags in stock prices, 
value investors evaluate individual stocks and the market as a whole 
by looking for good companies that have low stock prices relative to 
their dividends, earnings, and assets.
Such comparisons are often implicitly a contrarian strategy, doing 
the opposite of what the herd is doing. Stock prices are most likely 
to be low relative to dividends, earnings, and assets when most in-
vestors are gloomy and are most likely to be high when most inves-
tors are ebullient. Thus value investors tend to buy in the midst of 
gloom and sell in the midst of euphoria, effectively following War-
ren Buffett’s advice: “Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy 
when others are fearful.”
One appealing metric is the John Burr Williams (JBW) equation 
based on the dividend yield and an assumption about the long-run 
growth of dividends, perhaps the economy’s long-run growth rate. 
This total return estimate—the dividend yield plus the dividend 
growth rate—can be compared to the current interest rate on Trea-
sury bonds plus whatever risk premium satisfies you.
Another appealing metric is a comparison of Robert Shiller’s 
­cyclically adjusted earnings yield to the inflation-adjusted ten-year 
Treasury rate. Another is the Bogle model for estimating stock 
­returns over a ten-year horizon:
stock
return = dividend
yield
+ annual growth
of earnings
+ annual change
in P/E
These models can be applied to the market as a whole (as gauged 
by the S&P 500, for example) or to individual stocks. There is no 
guarantee it will work in the future, but the top-10 companies on 

Afterword       269
Fortune’s annual list of the most-admired companies have beaten the 
S&P 500 soundly. An appealing value strategy is to focus on the 
most-admired companies and use the JBW, Bogle, and Shiller mod-
els to assess whether these stocks are  attractively priced. 
DODGY STRATEGIES
It is risky to extrapolate a few years of a company’s earnings several 
decades into the future. In addition, growth per se is not valuable. A 
company that reduces its dividends in order to expand the company 
always increases the firm’s growth (as long as profits are positive) but 
doesn’t increase the value of its stock unless the profit is larger than 
the shareholders’ required return. Firms can also create an illusion 
of growth by acquiring companies with relatively low price-earnings 
ratios.
The Law of the Conservation of Investment Value says that the 
value of a firm depends on the cash it generates, regardless of how 
that cash is packaged or labeled. Nothing is gained or lost by com-
bining two income streams or by splitting income in two and calling 
one part one thing and the rest something else. This principle helps 
us understand why mergers, stock splits, stock dividends, cash divi-
dends, share repurchases, and stock sales do not directly help or 
hurt shareholders.
Don’t worship earnings per share. There are lots of ways that 
companies can increase earnings per share without benefiting share-
holders: investing in marginally profitable ventures; acquiring com-
panies with low price-earnings ratios; doing a reverse stock split. 
Value investors don’t drink the Kool-Aid because they compare a 
stock’s intrinsic value to its market price.

270      MONEY MACHINE
FOIBLES AND FOLLIES
Anchoring is a general human tendency to rely on a reference point; 
for example, judging the value of something by the price that was 
paid for it. A stock isn’t worth $50 because you bought it for $50. A 
house isn’t worth $400,000 because you paid $400,000 for it. Just 
because mortgage rates were 6 percent in the past doesn’t mean they 
will be 6 percent in the future.
The price you paid for a stock is a sunk cost that you cannot go 
back and change. Yet many investors are reluctant to sell losers, de-
spite the tax benefit, because selling for a loss is an admission that 
they made a mistake buying the stock in the first place. Think about 
whether a stock is cheap or expensive at its current price, not 
whether the price is higher or lower than the price you paid. Don’t 
make foolish wagers trying to recoup your losses. Get over them and 
move on.
A company whose earnings are up dramatically this year (or over 
the past few years) is more likely to have experienced good luck than 
bad luck and, most likely, will regress toward the mean in the future, 
disappointing overly optimistic investors. Don’t be among them.
The most optimistic earnings predictions are likely to be overly 
optimistic, which is why the stocks of companies with the most op-
timistic earnings forecasts usually do worse than stocks with rela-
tively pessimistic forecasts. Similarly, because of regression, stocks 
that are deleted from the Dow Jones Industrial Average generally 
outperform the stocks that replace them.
The bottom line is simple and sweet: Mr. Market’s mistakes cre-
ate opportunities for sensible value investors. Form your own opin-
ion about what stocks are really worth and, remember, stocks are 
money machines.
