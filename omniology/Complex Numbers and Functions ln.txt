A complex number  z  is a number of the form z

is called imaginary unit and a b

  a is called the real part and b the imaginary
part of  z, written
a
z
= Re      and     b

The Geometric Representation of Complex Numbers
In analytic geometry, any complex number z
a
ib a b
R
=
+
∈
,
,
 
 can be represented by
a point z
P a b
=
( , )  in xy-plane or Cartesian plane.  When the xy-plane is used in this
way to plot or represent complex numbers, it is called the Argand plane1 or the
complex  plane.  Under these circumstances, the x- or horizontal axis is called the axis
of real number or simply, real axis whereas the y- or vertical axis is called the axis of
imaginary numbers or simply, imaginary axis.
                                                          
1 The plane is named for Jean Robert Argand, a Swiss mathematician who proposed the representation of complex numbers in 
1806.

Furthermore, another possible representation of the complex number z in this plane is
as a vector OP .  We display z
a
ib
=
+
 as a directed line that begins at the origin and
terminates at the point P a b
( , ).  Hence the modulus of z, that is z , is the distance of
z
P a b
=
( , )  from the origin.  However, there are simple geometrical relationships
between the vectors for z
a
ib
=
+
, the negative of  z; −z  and the conjugate of  z; z
in the Argand plane.  The vector −z  is vector for z reflected through the origin,
whereas z  is the vector z reflected about the real axis.
The addition and subtraction of complex numbers can be interpreted as vector
addition which is given by the parallelogram law.  The ‘triangle inequality’ is
derivable from this geometric complex plane.  The length of the vector z
z
1
2
+
 is
z
z
1
2
+
, which must be less than or equal to the combined lengths z
z

+
.  Thus
z

Polar Representation of Complex Numbers
Frequently, points in the complex plane, which represent complex numbers, are
defined by means of polar coordinates.  The complex number z
x
iy
=
+
 can be
located as polar coordinate ( , )
r θ  instead of its rectangular coordinates ( , ),
x y  it
follows that there is a corresponding way to write complex number in polar form.
We see that  r is identical to the modulus of  z; whereas θ   is the directed angle from
the positive x-axis to the point  P.  Thus we have
x
r
=
cosθ          and       y
r
=
sinθ ,
where
r

θ
We called θ   the argument of  z  and write θ = arg .z   The angle θ   will be expressed
in radians and is regarded as positive when measured in the counterclockwise
direction and negative when measured clockwise.  The distance r is never negative.
For a point at the origin; z = 0, r  becomes zero.  Here θ  is undefined since a ray like
that cannot be constructed.  Consequently, we now defined the polar for  m of a
complex number z
x
iy
=
+
 as
z
r
i
=

(cos
sin )
θ
θ                                               (1)
Clearly, an important feature of arg z = θ   is that it is multivalued, which means for a
nonzero complex number z, it has an infinite number of distinct arguments (since

The Polynomial and Rational Functions

The Exponential Function
In defining complex exponential function, we seek a function which agrees with the
exponential function of calculus when the complex variable z
x
iy
=
+
 is real; that is
we must require that
f x
i
e x
(
)
+
=
0
   for all real numbers x,
and which has, by analogy, the following properties:

Remark
In calculus, we know that the real exponential function is one-to-one.  However ez  is
not one-to-one on the whole complex plane.  In fact, by (ix) it is periodic with period
i(
);
2π
 that is,
e
e
z i
k
z

,

The periodicity of the exponential implies that this function is infinitely many to one.
Trigonometric Functions
From the Euler’s identity we know that
e
x

x
ix =

Hence it is natural to define the sine and cosine functions of a complex variable z as
follows:

Given any complex number z, the complex trigonometric functions sinz  and cosz  in

The Logarithm

One of basic properties of the real-valued exponential function, e

this function is, in fact, infinitely many-to-one.
Obviously, we cannot define a complex logarithmic as a inverse function of complex
exponential since ez  is not one-to-one.  What we do instead of define the complex
logarithmic not as a single value ordinary function, but as a multivalued relationship
that inverts the complex exponential function; i.e.,
w
z
= log     if    z
ew

or it will preserve the simple relation
e

In general, the logarithm of any nonzero complex number is a multivalued relation.
However we can restrict the image values so as to defined a single-value function.

the logarithm of z is multivalued.  For this reason, depending on the value of c, z c
may has more than one numerical value.
The principle value of complex exponential c, z c  occurs when logz  is replaced by
principle logarithm function, Log z  in the previous definition. That is,

Inverse Trigonometric and Hyperbolic
In general, complex trigonometric and hyperbolic functions are infinite many-to-one
functions.  Thus, we define the inverse complex trigonometric and hyperbolic as
multiple-valued relation.
Definition:
For z
C
∈,  the inverse trigonometric arctrig z or trig −1z  is defined by
z
w
1
trig −
=
    if    z
w
= trig .
Here, ‘trig w’ denotes any of the complex trigonometric functions such as sin
,
w
cos ,
w  etc.
In fact, inverses of trigonometric and hyperbolic functions can be described in terms
of logarithms.  For instance, to obtain the inverse sine, sin
,
−1 z  we write w
z
=
−
sin 1
when z
w
= sin
. That is, w
