EDITOR’S NOTE
A WORD 
FROM
THE EDITOR
Sharil Abdul Rahman | PC.com Editor
G
ood March everyone. We have entered the third 
month of 2017, and we are steaming ahead 
onwards to a gadget and technology-filled year 
ahead. We at PC.com always wants to give you, 
our readers, the best – so let’s get crackin’.
The biggest question in the market right now – “Do I go for 
prepaid or post-paid for my phone line?” To some this question is 
easily answered – to others, it can be the dividing line between 
having a contactable line of communication or not eat for the 
month. We try to delve into the question in this month’s cover 
story, and help readers out on their quest to determining the best 
option for them.
School’s in (or at least the higher education campuses are 
starting up again soon), and of course you need the best and 
the greatest gadgets to pimp up your dorm or room to help you 
study. Check out our selection of new gadgets to look out for your 
student life in Gizmos. 
Tested is chock-full of new stuff to look out for. We have Intel’s 
first unlocked, Core i3 processor in the house – so do check out 
what it is like on our test bench. We also have the smallest full-
frame camera – the Sony RX1R Mk II on test, so check out what 
our reviewer has to say about it. Plus, we have a quick versus of 
the new Huawei Mate 9, and its predecessor the Mate 8 in the 
magazine. 
Subterrain is a horror game that is set on Mars, and features 
zombies in a top-down setting, If that sounds intriguing, check 
out our review in Gametime. Also, Wonderboy Returns is the 
revival of an old classic game on a new platform. Check out what 
we think of the game as well.
So what are you waiting for? Flip through March and march 
on to the beat of technology!
See you next month.

Hello there. I have a question about networks – who gives the

LETTER 
OF THE 
MONTH
Hi there Dargel.
Thank you for reading the magazine all the way in Cuba! We are thrilled hear that we have fans there. 
For security - both platforms offer the same amount of security options these days, as they have reached parity 
in offering the best secure mobile experience to the users. It all boils down to which user interface you are happy 
to use with - if you are open to customization, the Samsung Galaxy (and other Android phones) are your best bet. If 
you just want it to work - the iOS platform offers the best option.
It actually depends on what is your 
use-case scenario, and how you do 
intend of using your plans to the max. In 
fact, you can read up on our cover story 
this month where we talked a bit about 
this topic and see what is the best fit for 
your own usage needs.

n conjunction with the 10 year 
anniversary of the Sony Alpha 
line, Sony Malaysia has officially 
announced a new range of 
high speed Autofocus (AF) enabled 
cameras in multiple categories, which 
includes both mirrorless and compact 
cameras. The new Sony α99 II, 
α6500 and RX100 V are now officially 
launched in Malaysia. 
“We are continuing to push the 
boundaries of modern innovation in 
digital imaging, in particular within 
the mirrorless space,” said by Mr. 
Satoru Arai, Managing Director of Sony 
Malaysia. “Sony is an overall leader in 
digital imaging and the world's largest 
image sensor manufacturer. Over 
time, Sony has experienced a robust 
boost in mirrorless camera sales, 
strengthening our dominant position as 
the No.1 overall full-frame mirrorless 
brand, a position Sony has held for 6 
consecutive years since 2010, thanks to 
the immensely successful a7 series and 
α6500 series.”

A new Sony photography 
experience
The new Sony α99 II, α6500 and RX100 V launched in Malaysia
The new cameras are the epitome 
of the company’s journey in digital 
imaging thus far. The Sony α99 II is 
Sony’s update to the popular α99 
SLT camera, with a slew of new 
improvements and updates to the 
camera. First, it now receives the new 
42.4 megapixel full-frame sensor as 
the Sony α7-series, giving it a high 
dynamic range with every press of 
the shutter button. The camera also 
receives the 5-axis stabilisation 
system, ensuring shake-free images 
whenever the camera is in motion or 
in use. 4K recording is now standard 
in the camera as well. 
For 
the 
mirrorless 
market, 
the α6500 is an update in Sony’s 
mirrorless line-up. Shares the same 
unrivalled 4D FOCUS system as 
the α6300 camera, which can lock 
focus on a subject in as little as 
0.05 seconds. The new model can 
shoot images at up to 11 frames per 
second with continuous autofocus 
and exposure tracking and up to 
8 frames per second in a live-
view shooting mode with its 24.2 
megapixel Exmor sensor. Thanks to 
the expanded buffer, it can shoot up 
to 307 frames before running out of 
cache space. Also for the first time 
in the line’s history, the camera 
now comes equipped with both the 
5-axis stabilization system as well 
as a touch-sensitive screen for easy 
operation and navigation.
Compact cameras can’t get any 
better with the Sony Cybershot RX100 
V. In a small compact body, the camera 
hides a 20.1 megapixel 1-inch sensor, 
paired to a ZEISS Vario-Sonnar T* 
24-70 mm 5 F1.8 – 2.8 large aperture 
lens assembly as well as the excellent 
pop-up electronic view finder that is 
synonymous with the line. It also 
records in 4K video, as well as super 
slow motion recording at up to 960 
fps 7 with extended recording time.
The new α99 II, α6500 & RX100 V 
will be available throughout Malaysia 
with the pricing of RM12,299 for α99 
II; RM6,499 for α6500 (body only) and 
RM4,599 for the RX100 V.

and constantly being in front of 
a camera, the Neffos X Series 
provides her with the convenience 
of never having to miss capturing 
her precious moments. As the X

Series allows the J Revolusi actress 
to snap pictures perfectly and in no

“We wanted someone who can truly

elevate the brand to be among the 
serious contenders in Malaysia. 
Fazura was our first choice as she 
possesses all the criteria that 
we were looking for, so it came 
as no surprise to appoint her as 
the ambassador. Everyone knows 
that Fazura lives a fast-paced life, 
so having a quality device that 
is accurate and precise of up to

amous for being the camera

Not only is it powered with a

the new Dual PDAF technology. This 
drastically improves the rear camera

In addition to that, the R9s also

R9s is the Qualcomm octa-core 
processor, 4GB of RAM and 64GB

of the R9s is also equipped with 
98.9% metal, giving it a subtle yet 
refined look.

rab launches GrabShare 
in Malaysia. GrabShare is 
a commercial carpooling 
service which aims to 
provide cheaper fares for passengers, 
higher earnings for drivers, and 
reduce congestion in the city.
Malaysia has the third highest 
car ownership in the world, and that 
contributes to congestion issues 
especially in the city centre areas. 
Grab believes that GrabShare is 
an opportunity for a more effective 
system for both passengers and 
drivers. In a press conference, 
Country Manager for Grab Malaysia 
Sean Goh emphasises that Grab’s 
goal is to “provide safe transportation 
and enhance livelihood of drivers in 
the community.”
GrabShare will pair a maximum 
of two different bookings with 
similar trip routes on a single trip. 
For passengers, it translates to 
cheaper fares – up to 30%, with a 
maximum of 2 stops for the duration 
of their journey. For drivers, it 
means higher earnings, lower fuel 
consumption and a more effective 
way complete routes.
First launched end of last year 
in Singapore, Grab claims that their 
Singapore 
operations

Breaking bad 
password habits
Kaspersky says online users need to protect themselves with better passwords
nternet 
users 
across 
the 
globe are yet to master how 
to use passwords effectively 
to protect themselves online. 
Research from Kaspersky Lab has 
shown that people are putting their 
online safety at risk by making bad 
password decisions and simple 
password mistakes that may have 
far-reaching consequences.
“Considering the amount of 
private and sensitive information that 
we store online today, people should 
be taking better care to protect 
themselves with effective password 
protection. This seems obvious, but 
many might not realise that they 
are falling into the trap of making 
simple 
password 
management 
mistakes. These mistakes, in turn, 
are effectively like leaving the front 
door open to emails, bank accounts, 
personal files and more”, says Andrei 
Mochola, Head of Consumer Business 
at Kaspersky Lab.
Among the findings were that 
almost one in five people have faced 
an account hacking attempt. In 
spite of the high number only 30% 
of internet users create different 
passwords for different services – 
which is the recommended way to 
go. Even more worryingly, 10% use 
the same password for all their online 
accounts – making them a ripe target 
to be exploited. 
A 
weak 
password 
is 
also 
something of a concern – just a 
bit under half of users is a mix of 
upper and lowercase letters, and 
two-thirds mixes up with letters 
and numbers. A worrying trend 
is that users are mistreating 
their 
passwords 
by 
sharing 
them with other people. Family 
members, friends and even close 
acquaintances – passwords should 
not be shared with anybody. 
Kaspersky 
offers 
a 
secure 
password application called the 
Kaspersky 
Password 
manager, 
which 
securely 
stores 
all 
passwords, addresses and credit 
card details, and synchronises them 
across all devices so that users 
only need to remember one master 
password. Users no longer need 
I
to practise bad password habits, 
thanks to the password manager.
Mochola 
continued, 
“The 
Internet has been around for a 
while now but people are still 
making simple mistakes when it 
comes to online passwords. The 
best passwords cannot be found 
in the dictionary. They are long, 
with upper and lowercase letters, 
numbers and punctuation marks. 
However, with people having so 
many online accounts today, it’s 
not easy to remember a secure 
password for everything. Using a 
password management solution can 
help people remember and generate 
strong passwords to minimise the 
risk of account hacking online.”

ecently we at ESET had the opportunity 
– quite a fun and interesting opportunity 
– to visit a number of information security 
and cybersecurity conferences. These 
conferences were flooded with relatively ‘new’ 
developments such as NextGen, the Internet of 
Things (IoT), IoT DDoS attacks, security intelligence 
platform, etc. The fact that some of these terms have 
become ‘hype’ is not in itself a problem, but we did 
begin to wonder whether the security world may 
be looking at things in the wrong way and thereby 
missing the demands that need to be addressed.
LESSON 1: START WITH THE 
BUSINESS (AND ITS RISKS)
Security in practice can be exceptionally complex, 
but its essence is quite simple. It is nothing more than 
reducing or taking away risks, and making them visible 
so that the business can accept them and continue 
doing its work – nothing more, nothing less. To do 
this as effectively and efficiently as possible, we, as 
security people, have to understand the business and 
not see it solely from an IT perspective but from the 
broader perspective of the business itself.
R
When starting from the business, we first should 
identify, map, and categorize the risks of the specific 
business. Second, we have to determine, together 
with the business itself, which risks need to be dealt 
with and in which order. 
When that’s done, the person responsible for the 
security within the company must set up a security 
plan that describes how these changes are to be 
executed. In doing so, there must be clear goals and 
deadlines. Ideally, this should be done in a ‘smart’ 
way, one step at a time, so as not to engage in too 
many projects at once.
LESSON 2: DETERMINE A 
SECURITY ROADMAP WITH A 
CLEAR GOAL, STEP BY STEP
Defining your security approach (or security 
roadmap) is essential and should be discussed 
with your business on an ongoing basis to make 
adjustments where and when necessary. During the 
creation and execution of the roadmap, the projects 
that are defined will all contribute to the reduction of 
risks and the achievement of the end goal.
It’s important to not lose sight of the business 
goals, because the people responsible for security 
shouldn’t ‘restrict or obstruct’ the business with 
security measures. It’s not rocket science, and 
shouldn’t be treated like it is. The creation of a plan 
should be something that everyone, even without 
IT skills, can understand. Of course, IT plays a role, 
but only at the last moment when IT solutions are 
needed for the execution of the security projects.
LESSON 3: COVER THE BASICS 
BEFORE IMPLEMENTING MORE 
ADVANCED SECURITY SOLUTIONS
Looking back at the conferences we attended, 
we noticed that most organizations don’t even have 
basic security measures in place, let alone advanced 
security solutions. Security company presentations 
on these technologies often look stunning and offer 
interesting content, but they are simply too advanced 
for most companies. Furthermore, experience shows 
that the most hacks (about 90%) are still using the 
simplest methods and weaknesses: phishing emails, 
malware attachments, etc. And, of course, there is 
the weakest link of all: the human being.

Malaysia IT spending to 
reach RM 70.2 Billion in 2017
Gartner forecasts spending will increase globally by 2.7 percent
ompanies in Malaysia  are 
forecasted to spend up 
to RM 70.2 billion in the 
upcoming 12 months, according to 
research data supplied by Gartner. 
Worldwide, we are expected to see 
up to USD 3.5 trillion (about RM 15.6 
trillion) – which is an increase of 2.7 
percent over 2016, but falls short of 
the projected three percent. 
"2017 was poised to be a rebound 
year in IT spending. Some major 
trends have converged, including 
cloud, blockchain, digital business 
and artificial intelligence. Normally, 
this would have pushed IT spending 
much higher than 2.7 percent 
growth," said John-David Lovelock, 
research vice president at Gartner. 
"However, some of the political 
uncertainty in global markets has 
fostered a wait-and-see approach 
causing many enterprises to forestall 
IT investments."
The worldwide IT services market 
is forecast to grow 4.2 percent in 
2017. Buyer investments in digital 
business, intelligent automation, and 
services optimisation and innovation 
continue to drive growth in the 
market, but buyer caution, fuelled by 
broad economic challenges, remains 
a counter-balance to faster growth.
"The range of spending growth 
from the high to low is much larger 
in 2017 than in past years. Normally, 
the economic environment causes 
some level of division, however, 
in 2017 this is compounded by the 
increased levels of uncertainty," 
said Mr. Lovelock. "The result of that 
uncertainty is a division between 
individuals and corporations that will 
spend more — due to opportunities 
arising — and those that will retract 
or pause IT spending."

The Pew Research Center has found that over half of American citizens have been

The online security survey, released on 26 January this year, revealed that 64% of 
adults in the US have either reported or were notified of a data breach that had

reasons. After the full release, Gmail users won’t be able to send or receive mail 
containing .js attachments, even if they’re in a compressed and archived form.
Seeing that JavaScript attachments have proven to be one of the most popular 
ways for cybercriminals to spread their malicious work worldwide, this is good

their attention to more advanced technologies. Of 
course, these are important as well and they should 
be implemented in the future, but only after the 
basics are fortified. Often during security conferences 
there is a focus on sophisticated threats and APTs 
(advanced persistent threats), but companies such 
as TalkTalk and Ashley Madison might have been 
protected from attack if even basic security was in 
place.

New developments arise quickly and malicious 
groups and individuals are using more varied and 
advanced attacks and tactics. Eventually, more 
advanced security solutions will become inseparable 
from our organizations’ broader security roadmaps. 
However, the foundation has to be in place before 
the ‘house’ can be built. And to build this house, 
cooperation is needed between the architect, the 
realtor, the mason, the plasterer and of course the 
homeowner.
This sense of building something together is 
exactly what needs to happen in the security world. 
We have to cooperate intensively because, much 
like building a house, there is no single owner or 
architect who is also the best in masonry, painting, 
or construction.
No single security company has the best solution 
for each and every security risk, so working together 
is a must. Those who would cause your company 
harm are already doing this, so it’s time security 
professionals do the same. We need to start with 
the owner (the business) and the foundation (the 
roadmap), and then forge relationships with the 
right contractors (security vendors). Only then can a 
strong, reliable, and safe house be built.
LESSON 5: GET EVERYONE 
INVOLVED – IT’S THE ONLY ROAD 
TO SUCCESS
To make progress between security and the 
business, there has to be understanding and 
support from the business – and vice versa. The 
one(s) responsible for security has to be able 
to provide short and clear explanations in order 
to get all of the different stakeholders in the 
company to participate. If he or she can’t, then the 
business (and the board) will never understand, 
and there won’t be the necessary buy-in and 
support to implement your plans (no matter how 
good they may be). As Einstein once said: “If you 
can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it 
well enough!”

016 has been a challenging year for politics, 
public sanity and celebrity longevity, 
but at the same time for individuals and 
companies, a testing time in terms of online 
security. Pitted against increasingly sophisticated 
and targeted cybercriminals, it’s not been easy 
going, as these notable security incidents from the 
past 12 months reveal.
Dyn DDOS ATTACK
In October, cybercriminals launched major DDoS 
attacks, disrupting a host of websites, including the 
likes of Twitter, Netflix, PayPal, Pinterest and the 
PlayStation Network, amongst many others.
The attack was staggering for its size, at one 
time measuring close to 1 Tbps. The group behind 
the attack did this by compromising thousands of 
endpoint IoT devices (initially thought to be 100,000 
– later downscaled to nearer 20,000 by security 
researchers), transforming them in a botnet and 
essentially flooding traffic to DNS hosting provider 
Dyn (recently acquired by Oracle).
Of course, this attack had a short-term effect on 
some of the world’s most popular sites but that’s not 
what makes it significant, nor too the attack method 
(DDoS remains in the toolkit of every cybercriminal).
No, the attack was staggering for its size, 
measuring close to 1 Tbps at one time, which was 
not dissimilar to the DDoS attack which targeted 
Brian Krebs’ website one month earlier (more on 
this later). And with Gartner predicting that there 
will be 20.8 billion ‘connected’ things talking to 
each other by 2020, you can be sure that this kind 
of DDoS attack is just the start.

TESCO BAnK CuSTOMERS lOSE 
REAl MOnEy
Approximately 40,000 Tesco Bank accounts were 
compromised in a cyberattack in early November, 
but this in itself was not hugely significant – after 
all we have seen bigger data breaches (think 
Target in 2013).
Instead, it was the tale of thousands of 
customers losing physical money from their 
accounts – a rarity in a cybercrime age where 
most damage is naked to the human eye.
The bank, which has more than seven million 
customers, reported that roughly 9,000 customers 
had as much as £600 (approximately $763) 
siphoned from their accounts, and pledged to 
refund those losses within 24 working hours.
The precise nature of the attack was unclear, 
with some suggesting the compromise of a third-
party retailer and others pointing to cybercriminal 
activity. One customer said that cash had been 
withdrawn from his account in four separate 
transactions, with all of these coming from Rio de 
Janeiro in Brazil.
Needless to say the attack has far-reaching 
consequences not only for the customer but 
for Tesco too, with the UK’s Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA) preparing to issue a potentially 
huge fine.
DDOS AuTOMATInG SySTEMS 
In FInlAnD
The Dyn DNS attack rightfully grabbed the 
headlines for IoT security (or lack of it) in 
October, but one month later there was another 
security incident that had arguably far bigger 
consequences.
In an attack that once again illustrates the 
danger of connected IoT devices, cybercriminals 
in Finland were able to halt the heating in two 
buildings in the city of Lappeenranta.
Local reports suggest that cybercriminals 
were not only able to compromise the building 
automation system used across the two buildings 
by flooding it with bogus traffic – forcing devices 
to restart every few minutes – but also denying 
administers remote access to the device.
This meant that technicians had to physically 
visit the buildings and remove the affected 
hardware from the internet until the malicious 
traffic could be filtered out.
IT management company Valtia said that there 
is strong evidence that vulnerable and internet 
exposed devices manufactured by the local 
tech manufacturer Fidelix were to blame for the 
incident.

In February, cybercriminals reportedly angry about 
US ties with Israel breached the US Department of 
Justice’s database.
The attack highlighted how big government

phone numbers, and email addresses, although 
the Department of Justice said it did not believe 
other sensitive information, such as social security 
numbers, were obtained.
The method of attack remains a mystery, but what 
is significant about it is that it revealed that not only 
can cybercriminals compromise a big government 
agency, but also drew attention to the fact that they 
suffer from the very same issues as enterprises.
After all, the cybercriminals – apparently 
tweeting from the account @DotGovs – claimed 
it took one week for the Department of Justice to 
realize that their systems had been compromised.
ADulTFRIEnDFInDER.COM GETS 
ATTACKED OnCE MORE
X-rated adult website AdultFriendFinder has now 
been hit by cybercriminals in consecutive years, 
with this year’s attack in November involving far 
more people than before.
This time, the amount of accounts compromised 
was immense — approximately 412 million users 
had personal information stolen and published in 
criminal marketplaces on the dark web.
The breached data included email addresses, 
passwords, VIP member status, browser info, last 
IP address to log in, and purchases. LeakedSource 
was responsible for finding and reporting the 
breach to the public’s attention.
What can we learn from this? Organizations 
will continue to ignore security if they see 
breaches as good PR, and online privacy can never 
be guaranteed – wherever you go on the web.
nO ‘PEACE OF MInD’ FOR 
lInKEDIn, TuMBlR AnD 
MySPACE
Back in June, a cybercriminal going by the name of 
‘Peace’ came to prominence after data on millions 
of LinkedIn, Tumblr and Myspace users was made 
available online. All in, there were more than half 
a billion passwords posted.
Indeed, Peace’s dark web store has plenty 
of merchandise. According to Wired, his store 
includes 167 million user accounts from LinkedIn, 
360 million from MySpace, 68 million from Tumblr, 
100 million from the Russian social media site 
VK.com, and most recently another 71 million 
from Twitter, adding up to more than 800 million 
accounts and growing.
These collections of data thefts resulted in 
the social media takeovers of Facebook CEO Mark 
Zuckerberg, popstars Katy Perry and Drake, and 
Twitter cofounder Biz Stone to name a few.
But quite how he – if he indeed did it alone 
– managed to clock up such a data pool remains a 
mystery. There’s some suggestion that this is old 
data dating back to 2012 and that the severity of 
these attacks has been magnified through people 
reusing passwords.
KREBS SITE HIT WITH DDOS
Security journalist and researcher Brian Krebs is a 
respected name in the industry, outing cybercrime 
groups and revealing data breaches long before the 
affected companies themselves even knew of them.
But such efforts can put you at the hands of the 
wrong people, as Krebs found out in September when 
his website, arguably far more secure than most, 
was hit by a (then) record DDoS attack measuring in 
at between 620 and 655 Gbps.
The attack, though unsuccessful thanks to the 
efforts of the DNS provider Akamai, was stunning 
because the previous record-high DDoS attack was 
363 Gbps. Not only that but, whilst the smaller attack 
was reliant on a technique to essentially ‘amplify’ a 
smaller attack into a bigger one, the Krebs’ attack 
turned out to simply be launched by a huge botnet of 
compromised devices.
What did we learn from this? Well, DDoS attacks 
are growing at a rapid rate in terms of size, and they 
are no longer just an entry-level attack to launch 
another attack, or to further infiltrate the network.
yAHOO SuFFERS FROM MASSIVE 
DATA BREACH #1
In September, search engine, email provider and one-
time Google rival Yahoo was hit by what was later 
described as the ‘biggest data breach in history’.
The company was forced to admit that up to 
500 million customers may have had data stolen, 
including sensitive details such as names, email 
addresses, phone numbers and hashed passwords. 
While the size of attack was significant, it was 
notable too that fingers were being pointed at a 
state-sponsored actor.
This was not Yahoo’s first embarrassment 
as far as cybersecurity is concerned – it was 
breached in 2014 too – but what is particularly 
intriguing is that Yahoo may have known about 
the attack since August, two months prior to the 
breach being reported.
yAHOO SuFFERS FROM MASSIVE 
DATA BREACH #2
We often write ahead in the industry, meaning 
that this security incident didn’t even make the 
first draft of this feature. But, there you go 
– you can never rest on your laurels when it 
comes to cybercrime.
This unprecedented data breach made the 
front pages of websites all over the world on 
December 14th and 15th. Yahoo announced that 
this time around, up to one billion user accounts 
were thought to have been compromised – 
and, more devastatingly, it was revealed that 
this was a different incident to that related to 
2014’s data breach.
According to Bob Lord, chief information 
security officer at Yahoo, it is believed that this 
data breach goes back as far as August 2013. 
While names, email addresses, phone numbers 
and hashed passwords were accessed, no bank 
account and payment data was compromised 
(it’s not stored on its system).
ESET’s Mark James commented: “So what 
can you do about the breach? NOTHING! Sorry, 
but it’s true, there is nothing you can do about 
that particular data breach but you can try and 
limit any further damage as a result of your data 
going missing.”
Accordingly, he offers some really useful 
and insightful security advice, so please do 
read his article. What does this mean for the 
security industry? It’s too early to say, but what 
is certain is that this marks a tipping point.
PHIlIPPInE ElECTIOn VOTERS 
TARGETED By AnOnyMOuS
It may not have made front pages in the western 
hemisphere, but in April this was one of the 
most poignant and devastating cyberattacks of 
2016.
A breach of the database for the Philippine 
Commission on Elections (COMELEC) resulted 
in the loss of personal information on every 
single voter in the Philippines — approximately 
55 million people. Allegedly breached by 
Anonymous Philippines, the information was 
made public online by Lulzsec Pilipinas.
Anonymous’ actions were allegedly an effort 
to push COMELEC to turn on security features 
in the vote counting machines before the 
national elections on May 9th. This comes at 
an interesting time, and suggests politics could 
well be more influenced by outside forces than 
we like to admit.

 A Security Asset
Internet security trends with ESET
rotecting yourself while 
being online has become 
a need, especially when 
you never know when danger 
lurks. Malicious software and 
even people can even conceal 
themselves to make it look like 
you’re safe…in actuality, it just 
makes you let your guard down. 
As internet threats get more 
and more diverse, users need 
more complex internet security 
suites with features based on 
individual preferences. PC.com 
speaks to Roman Kovac, Head of 
Security Research lab of ESET 
HQ Slovakia to find out what the 
company is about and some of the 
many threats that lurks online. 
PC.com: Tell us about your role 
in ESET. 
Roman Kovac: I’m responsible 
for the Security Research Lab, or 
shortly, Virus Lab. The department 
has 
several 
roles 
including 
malware analysts, researchers, 
and detection engineers. Our 
method of detecting new threats 
can be done through technology, 
which involves proactive detection. 
We can detect threats through the 
samples we have even before it 
happens, though not all the time. 
In some cases, you need to create 
different layers of protection to be 
able to catch them. 
PC.com: 
What 
should 
consumers be concerned about 
when it comes to Internet 
security? 
Kovac: I would say one of them 
would be ransomware. As the 
name suggest, there will be some 
sort of ransom involved, which we 
don’t recommend “paying”. Some 
people unfortunately do. The best 
way is to have a proper backup 
system in place – even if you’re 
infected with ransomware, you’ll 
have no issue since you can just 
use the backup files. However, 
most consumers don’t have a 
system in place; I don’t think the 
vast majority are aware of the 
need. Another concern would be 
banking Trojans. 
PC.com: How is this different 
from 
those 
banking 
email 
scams and why is it happening?
Kovac: This isn’t something new 
but it’s continuously evolving 
and coming back all the time. 
Recently, there had been several 
cases in Europe where a malware 
called Remote Access Trojan (RAT) 
was stealing Internet banking 
credentials. It was targeting users 
of European online banking. 
This is still happening because 
users are not careful about the 
links they click and freely provide 
their information to pages that 
look legitimate without checking 
the authenticity. It’s definitely a 
challenge for users to distinguish 
some of them as some of them look 
like the real deal, right down to the 
‘Secure’ certification on the browser. 
Unless you click on the ‘Secure’ 
lock icon and check the details of 
the certificate, you’ll be fooled into 
thinking that it is really the bank’s 
online banking login page. 
PC.com: How about things like 
adware? Should consumers be 
concerned about this as well? 
Kovac: Adware is something is quite 
prevalent but it isn’t as dangerous 
as ransomware or banking Trojans. 
It can definitely affect the users 
experience and the performance of 
your computer.
PC.com: How can consumers 
protect themselves from these 
threats? 
Kovac: First and foremost, you should 
do regular updates on the operating 
system and the applications you use 
due to the various evolving exploits. 
This is especially so in an office 
setting, where your browser should 
also be regularly updated. 
P
Secondly, it’s always recommended 
to have a good security solution in place 
like an anti-virus. You don’t need an overly 
complicated security solution in place to 
protect yourself. For basic needs, we 
have the ESET Internet Security. If you’re 
looking for a suite, the new version 10 
of our ESET Smart Security Premium is 
built upon the award-winning NOD32 
technology that offers the optimal mix of 
detection, speed and usability.

new threats can be done

Parents setting 
bad behaviour 
online for their 
kids 
Kaspersky finds that children are unimpressed by parents’ 
online behaviour
ocial media give us the freedom to 
communicate with our loved ones, 
whenever and wherever we want. 
However, this freedom comes at a cost: blinded 
by our seemingly happy digital lives we often 
don’t realize how social media threatens and 
damages our real-life relationships. New 
research from Kaspersky Lab shows that a third 
of people communicate less face-to- face with 
their loved ones, and 21% of parents admit 
that relationships with their children have been 
damaged as a result of them being seen in a 
compromising situation on social media.
Dr. Astrid Carolus, Media Psychologist at 
the University of Würzburg comments that: 
“Studies show that today digital communication 
complements real-life communication. We live in 
a globalized and highly mobile world resulting in 
distances between partners and family members. 
Digital communication is an opportunity to 
bridge the gaps in our modern lives caused by 
living in different cities or countries. However, 
digital communication cannot replace face-to-
face communication - at least not always and not 
completely. Digital communication is less rich in 
terms of sensory channels affected, resulting in 
“reduced” sensory quality.”
With the study finding that although social 
media can help ease communication channels 
and bridge time zones and distance barriers, it 
doesn’t always make people happy. It can strain 
relationships as well as leaving people feeling 
S
down and upset, as they constantly compare their 
lives to those of others. The hunt for “likes” and 
social validation leads people to share increasing 
amounts of private information on social media 
platforms, putting not only themselves but also 
their friends, family and colleagues at risk. For 
those who decide to shut themselves off from 
social media, the reality of losing a lifetime 
of digital memories, including photos and 
interactions, can make it difficult to do.
In order to protect themselves and their 
relationships, people need to be more cautious 
and cyber-savvy about the information they 
share on social media. That will not only help to 
mitigate the risks of the online world, but prevent 
relationship damage in the offline world. To help 
people keep their memories safe, no matter how 
long their online social media journey, Kaspersky 
Lab is developing a new app. FFForget will enable 
people to back-up all of their memories from their 
social networks, keeping them in a safe, encrypted 
memory container.

Prepaid vs Postpaid 
– who wins?
By Sharil Abdul Rahman
he telco market in Malaysia has seen many changes over the last twenty years – from the introduction of GSM services 
to the latest generation high-speed LTE connectivity. We have 4G connectivity just about everywhere in the country – and 
because of that we are burdened with a big problem – who do I choose for my telco provider and do I go the prepaid or 
postpaid route?

“W
hat an incredible 
way to celebrate 
the 
50th 
anniversary 
of 
CES – with the largest show floor in our 
history showcasing the next generation 
of innovation that will revolutionise our 
world,” says Gary Shapiro, president and 
CEO, CTA.
“The products and services unveiled 
at CES 2017 will touch nearly every 
single global industry. From the latest 
in virtual reality, smart home, self-
driving vehicles, robotics, wearables, 
health and fitness tech and more, 
CES 2017 is unveiling the future of 
the connected experience and what 
it means for consumers around the 
world.”
Prior to the actual show days, 
more than 2,000 members of the press 
got a sneak peak of the innovation to 
be launched. The quintessential CES 
Unveiled – an annual exclusive for 
media affair – featured the latest in 
virtual reality, companion sensing 
robots, wireless headphones, sleep 
trackers, smart lighting, wearables 
and much more. 
In addition to CES Unveiled, CES 
2017 introduced two full Media Days, 
where a wide array of companies 
– both large and small – took the 
opportunity to introduce its latest 
products to the global market. The 
range of launches set the stage 
for the week filled with innovation 
as 28 companies hosted pre-show 
news conferences and major product 
announcements. Here are just some 
of our picks: 
Samsung
Samsung 
Electronics 
unveiled 
its vision for 2017 and how it is 
reaching higher with a wide range of 
innovations to provide consumers with 
their best experience yet at the CES 
2017. Key product announcements 
included the stunning new QLED TV 
line-up, FlexWash + FlexDry laundry 
system, Samsung’s first-ever gaming 
laptop – the Samsung Notebook 
Odyssey, and updates to the Gear S3 
smartwatch. 
Additionally, 
the 
consumer 
tech giant bagged more than 120 
awards at CES 2017 in the home 
entertainment, home appliance and 
mobile categories. Among Samsung’s 
notable wins are 34 CES 2017 
Innovation Awards, including its new 
QLED TV line-up; a new Lifestyle TV 
designed to appear just like a picture 
would appear on a wall, the Samsung 
FlexWash + FlexDry,  as well as its 
Chromebook Plus and Pro. 
Honor
Following its launch in the China 
market end of last year, the honor 6X 
made its global debut at CES 2017. 
George Zhao, President of honor, 
shared the growth of honor in the 
United States since its inception into 
the market last year – with the honor 
5X.
The honor 6X features a Bézier 
curved-inspired 
design 
that 
is 
reminiscent of the Earth’s horizon. 
Its 5.5-inch FHD display with 2.5D 
curved glass protection in paired 
with a Huawei Kirin 655 Octa-core 
processor 
and 
Mali-T830 
MP2 
GPU. The 6X is currently running on 
Android 6.0 Marshmallow with its 
proprietary EMUI 4.1, with upgrades 
to Android 5.0 Nougat and EMUI 5.0 
to be rolled out within 2017Q1/2. The 
model comes in two variants: 3GB 
RAM with 32GB storage or 4GB RAM 
with 64GB storage.
While all the details of the model 
had the been out for some time now, 
availability and/or pricing outside of 
China wasn’t made available until its 
product launch event in Las Vegas 
today. Malaysia is included in the 
list of countries where the honor 6X 
will be made available sometime this 
month.
Only the international pricing has 
been made available: US$249.99 and 
US$299.99 (≅ RM1,125 and RM1,350) 
for the 3GB and 4GB variants 
respectively. Given the price different 
between the US market and China 
market (999 Chinese Yuan and 1,599 
Chinese Yuan / ≅ RM647 and RM1,035 
respectively), we anticipate it be fall 
somewhere in the middle. Perhaps

COVER STORY
I 
was doing some research for telcos in Malaysia 
as I was looking for a telco solution for my 
mother that is cost effective yet complete with 
the expected high speed internet connectivity 
that is on offer today. What I found was that there 
are so many options available out there, that one 
can drown in options right out of the gate. 
Right now there are four main telcos in Malaysia 
that ply their trade, with multitude more acting as 
MVNOs or Mobile Virtual Network Operators. The 
former usually have their own network up and 
running, while the latter piggy backs on current 
network through agreements made with the big 
four. Most of the companies has both prepaid and 
post-paid solutions – with one or two are on ether 
prepaid or post-paid exclusively. All of these choices 
can make things hard for the end consumer as there 
are literally a multitude of choices to choose from 
when considering a postpaid or prepaid line. 
The biggest difference between having a 
prepaid and a post-paid line is the way you pay for 
your purchase – we all know how to head to the 
nearest convenience store or small vendor to buy 
tickets and tabs with the codes printed on them 
to reload onto your account. These purchases can 
either be for the short term – with validity only 
lasting a week – or longer term purchases with 
validity that can last for a whole year. 
Post-paid accounts meanwhile mean that the 
account holder pays at the end of ever billing cycle, 
and will be billed based on the commitment level 
that they have agreed upon registering. Anything 
else is charged extra on top of the commitment 
amount. 
Prepaid and post-paid accounts each has its 
own pros and cons – where prepaid are usually 
cheaper to get into, post-paid accounts will have 
month-long validity even if the commitment amount 
is small. On the other hand, the total cost for 
prepaid purchases may be wasted if users do not 
use the amount reloaded into the account as the 
validity period for each reload is set, and will not 
be valid once the time window is passed. For post-
paid accounts mean while you could potentially be 
locked to the contract for a long period of time and 
there may be even hidden charges that was not 
specified in the beginning of the tenure. 
What makes the companies differ from one 
and another? It all boils down to the features that 
they offer to each customer at different pricing 
tiers. Each company brings to the table different 
packages that may or may not appeal to users 
out there. Some may need more data, others may 
need more calls on their package. This means that 
companies will have to cater to a wide range of 
needs on the market – ranging from those who just 
need the basics, to those who needs all the boxes 
ticked. 
The problem with these packages is that they 
are set in stone, and under the banner of one fit 
all. No telco in the market currently offer piece-
meal and ala-carte offerings for those who are just 
looking for a particular facet of communications. 
Some companies did use to offer data-centric 
contracts or call-centric contract – however

Also available on display was 
the honor Magic, a new generation 
smart device that integrates Tobii 
Eye Tracking features. The device is 
only currently available in China with 
no indications of release into other 
markets. 
Faraday Future
Autonomous cars are gaining traction, 
and Faraday Future plans to bank 
on this upward trend. The company 
unveiled the FF 91, its first production 
vehicle, building upon its Variable 
Platform Architecture (VPA). The 
FF 91 is essentially a fully-electric, 
fully-connected, self-driving, keyless 
vehicle experience with a “driverless 
valet” function that allows the car to 
park itself from your smartphone.
It represents a bold new breed 
of electric mobility that combines 
supercar 
performance, 
precise 
handling, the comfort of an ultra-
luxury passenger vehicle, and a 
unique 
collection 
of 
intelligent 
internet features.
Faraday 
Future’s 
proprietary 
VPA is a flexible powertrain system 
featuring 
a 
monocoque 
vehicle 
structure in which the chassis and 
body are a single form – providing 
measurable improvements in overall 
vehicle rigidity, safety and handling. 
An available all-wheel drive 
system offers greater traction, control 
and precise power distribution. 
The VPA also houses class-leading 
battery technology, multiple motor 
and battery configurations, as well 
as the company’s first patent: the FF 
Echelon Inverter.
Through its strategic partnership 
with LeEco, a global Internet company 
that seamlessly blends devices, 
content, applications and distribution 
into a first-of-its kind ecosystem, 
FF 91 offers the ultimate in-car 
connectivity. FF EcoSystem integrates 
users’ digital lives into FF 91, giving 
access to the apps and content, 
while learning user’s preferences 
over time to create a smarter, more 
personalised experience.
LG 
LG Electronics (LG) took the stage at 
CES 2017 as it unveiled the newest 
top-of-the-line LG SIGNATURE OLED 
TV W -  the pinnacle of the brand’s 
new line-up of flat-panel TVs. 
Deemed as “The Wallpaper TV”, 
the series features Dolby Vision and 
Dolby Atmos sound, with a total of 10 
different models. Its 77-inch model 
boasts of being ultra-thin, in addition 
to winning the 2017 CES Best of 
Innovation Award. 
The brand also highlighted an 
expanded line-up of audio products to 
appeal to a wide range of consumers 
from avid audiophiles to casual 
listeners who prioritise portability 
and versatility. LG’s newest audio 
devices, namely the LG SJ9 sound 
bar and LG LOUDR CJ98, implement 
emerging technologies to maximize 
synergy with LG’s premium TVs and 
to broaden the possibilities of where 
consumers can take their favourite 
music.
ZTE
Using the ever-popular crowdsourcing 
platform Kickstarter, ZTE introduced 
Project CSX (Crowd Source X), which 
entails the ZTE Hawkeye – the world’s 
first crowdsourced phone. The idea, 
design and name of the phone came 
directly from consumers, who are 
engaged in the different phases of 
the project, from selecting materials, 
colours and help contribute software 
for the device. Essentially, ZTE has 
given the reigns to consumers of 
what to build for 2017. 
Following a round of voting 
by consumers representing 176 
countries globally, the consensus was 
to develop a hands-free experience 
for a mobile device. The key features, 
submitted by a team of four creative 
designers who won the Project CSX 
competition, allow an experience 
that does not require the use of 
hands to navigate through common 
smartphone applications:
•   Scrolling based on Eye-Tracking 
By recognising movement of the 
eyes, pages can scroll automatically 
up-down or left-right based on 
movement.  Voice commands can be 
used to navigate between pages. 
•  Stick to Walls and Surfaces with 
Self-Adhesive Case
With an optional case, the phone 
can be mounted to a vertical surface, 
freeing up the need to hold the phone.  
These 
unique 
features 
give 
consumers 
the 
opportunity 
to 
continue use of their phone and 
applications in times when one or 
both hands are otherwise occupied.
Casio
Casio Computer Co., Ltd. announced 
the second addition to its Smart 
Outdoor 
Watch 
category, 
now 
featuring water resistance and tough 
performance for outdoor activities. 
The new WSD-F20 runs on Android 
Wear 2.0 and is equipped with low-
power GPS with a new colour map 
functionality that can be used offline.

Its predecessor, the WSD-F10, was well-
received as a truly practical wrist device that 
delivers the unique advantages of a wearable 
device for the outdoors. Further improving on its 
success, the all-new WSD-F20 now supports a 
wide range of outdoor and water activities and can 
be used in areas without cellular service, freeing up 
users to fully enjoy their adventures.
In terms of design, button guards, a protective 
bezel, and side buttons of varying sizes enhance 
operability and toughness, making the WSD-F20 
an even more useful piece of outdoor gear. The 
WSD-F20 is positioned in the PRO TREK Smart 
series, the latest addition to the PRO TREK brand 
of outdoor watches by Casio that are designed for 
total appeal to outdoor enthusiasts.
The WSD-F20 will be available in the U.S. market 
on 21 April 2017, retailing for US$500. Its global 
release will possibly happen sometime in May this 
year. No indications if Malaysia will be in the list.

longer battery life.
Toyota 
Concept-i, a self-driving car allowing passengers to 
interact with the car’s artificial intelligence agent 
named “Yui,” which anticipates drivers’ needs, 
measures emotions and responds automatically.
Razer
Dubbed Project Valerie, the system is the world’s 
first portable laptop with three built-in monitors. 
Its Project Ariana, on the other hand, takes 
environmental information from within a video 
game and intelligently projects it around a room, 
virtually engulfing a player in real-time action 
previously reserved for on-screen entertainment 
only.
Unfortunately, at the end of CES 2017, Min-
Liang Tan – CEO of Razer – announced on his 
Facebook page that both Project Valerie prototypes 
were stolen from the show floor while the crew 
were packing up for the day. The whereabouts of 
the units are still sketchy at best, with rumours 
that one of the two units appearing for sale on a 
Chinese online shopping portal.

FEB 2017
these days the days of just wanting to call people 
unlimitedly has gone to the dogs. 
There are reasons on why this is happening 
– there are apps that are now offering unlimited 
voice calls at the expense of data. This means that 
companies that offers better data rates may surge 
ahead than others in the same field. Data is getting 
cheap, no denying of that. 
To that end, companies are aggressively 
promoting their packages to the end consumer, with 
some companies crossing the price line where their 
post-paid packages are cheaper than prepaid lines. 
The question is – are they as cheap as they purport 
them to be? 
Several companies are pushing cheap post-
paid packages that may be cheap in the short term, 
but comes with additional costs in the longer run. 
However, some post-paid accounts are truly cheap 
and full of value that it is a waste to not be on board 
with them. 
Take uMobile for example. Their cheapest 
package is the u28, which gives users 3GB of Data, 
50 minutes of free calls to all networks and 300 
free SMSs – all of this for only RM28 a month. The 
nearest post-paid offering is from Celcom, where it 
costs RM45 monthly, and gives customers 4GB of 
Data, (which is split into 2GB for weekdays and 2GB 
for weekends) plus50 SMS and call minutes to all 
networks. 
At the same time, prepaids can cost more than 
what uMobile offers. Take for example TuneTalk. You 
can buy their SIM pack from just about any shops in 
Malaysia, and they accept the usual prepaid reload 
vouchers to be used for calls, data and whatnot. 
What makes them different is that users can also 
pay for one year validity – which means that the 
number can be kept valid for one year even when it is 
not topped up regularly. The catch is that the service 
costs RM28, and users need at least RM 33 balance 
in their account to enable this service for their line.
Going back to the uMobile package – users 
technically get what they paid, with caveats here 
and there. For example – the 300 free SMSes? It is 
split to 100 SMS for uMobile numbers and 200 for 
other networks. And if you go past the allocated free 
quota – your calls will be charged extra. You will 
be charged 9sen for every 30 seconds of call with 
uMobile numbers and 10sen for every 30 seconds. 
Prepaid can also rack up charges when using the 
line – but the biggest cost lost when using prepaid 
lines are the fact that your top-up is only valid for 
a short time. For example, a RM10 top-up with a 
single prepaid company will last you for a week, so 
on average you will need to pay about RM40 a month 
just to keep your line active – unless you are with 
TuneTalk. Imagine the cost if you are a light user and 
you have to reload just to keep your line active. 
The upside of all of this that customer is king 
– they are free to make their own choice. This also 
gives chance to telco companies in creating and 
customising new packages for new and retaining 
customers. In the end, we have to check on the 
user’s side on how they use their phone as different 
consumers will have different ways of using their 
phones. Some may want extra data, some extra 
minutes to talk – others may just want to have a 
line for family and friends to contact them during 
emergencies.

Unlock Your Potential
Intel Core i3 7350K
I
ntel’s latest generation of 
processor has now seen the 
light of day. While hardcore (and 
deep pocketed) enthusiasts 
would flock to the flagship Kaby 
Lake Intel Core i7 7700K, we have 
our eyes on a much lower end (and 
cheaper) option, the Intel Core i3 
7350K. Yes folks, finally unlocked 
multiplier has come to the i3 range. 
How well would it perform? Let’s find 
out.
Socket Rocket
The processor can be installed in a 
motherboard with LGA 1151 socket, 
hence it should work with any 
motherboard featuring not only the 
latest Intel 200 chipset, but also the 
last generation Intel 100, albeit with a 
bios update. 
The Core i3 7350K also features Intel 
HD630 graphics, with hardware HEVC 
4K encoding which means this is one 
of the few processors that supports 
Netflix native 4K streaming.
Backwards 
Compatible
Thanks to socket 
LGA1151 this chip can be 
used on current series 
200 motherboards and 
older series 100
Not Cheap
Unfortunately power 
comes at a price.
Unlocked Power
This is the first i3 from 
intel to have the K suffix, 
So, it bodes well for 
consumers
New 
Generation
of brains
Low Thermal Performer
The Intel Core i3 range is usually Intel’s 
entry level range of processor for the 
Core range. So seeing an unlocked 
option was quite a surprise for us. 
Clocked at 4.2Ghz, it’s the fastest of 
all the Kaby Lake i3. Heck, it’s as fast 
as the flagship Core i7 7700K and 
faster than all of the Kaby Lake i5, 
meaning it should have high single core 
performance. Unlike Core i5 and i7, 
there is no Intel Turbo Boost.
The processor is physically dual 
core with four working thread thanks 
to Intel’s Hyper Threading, meaning 
your OS will see four cores. With a 
TDP of 60W, it’s lower than the 91W 
on an unlocked i5 or i7, but is much 
cooler.

Testing
We tested the processor with an MSI 
Z270 Krait Gaming motherboard, with 
16GB of Kingston HyperX Fury DDR4 
RAM. Starting at 4200Mhz, we slowly 
clock up the multiplier 200Mhz at a 
time until we can’t boot into windows. 
The processor seems to achieve a 
stable overclock at 4.8Ghz with 1.3V 
core voltage. In terms of temperature, 
the Core i3 7350K was quite cool, not 
really going over 65 celcius during 
benchmark with our third party cooler, 
and hovering around 80 celcius with an 
intel stock cooler.
Thoughts
If you are looking for a processor 
to overclock without having to 
spend a bomb, then the Intel Core 
i3 7350K might be the one for you. 
It’s good enough for gaming, with 
HyperThreading helping a bit with 
games that utilises multi-core. That 
being said, you need a high end 
motherboard to actually let you 
overclock so you might not be saving 
that much money as you might think. 
An Option For 
Gamers
While this is not the 
cheapest of its class it is 
still a good processor to 
consider.

Go for Pro
Sony Playstation 4 Pro
Landslide Popularity 
Given that the Sony PlayStation 
4 Pro (PS4 Pro) made its debut 
in Malaysia just six months ago, 
this particular variant of the ever-
popular gaming console has gained 
immense popularity. So much so 
that it is currently (at the time of 
print) sold out through the country, 
with distributors taking in pre-orders 
slated for delivery sometime in 
2017Q1. I can certainly see the appeal 
of the PS4 Pro as oppose to the con-
currently launched PS4 Slim.  
All About 4K  
The PS4 Pro comes with upgraded 
performance and system 
architecture, thanks to its CPU 
and GPU, to fully deliver better 
graphics and visuals. If you already 
have a 4K TV or monitor, the 
system will automatically render or 
upscale your PS4 titles to a higher 
quality gameplay experience. The 
higher frame rate also contributes 
to better graphic, which I can 
appreciate in more visually detailed 
games. Its streaming applications 
can also now support 4K video 
playback through Netflix and 
YouTube, if you’re keen. So far, I 
can’t seem to tear my eyes away 
from FFXV. 
Same-same but Different
The PS4 Pro sports a similar slanted 
body form factor, but instead of two, it 
consists of three layers of blocks

“Forget I even asked 
that question. FFXV

FIRST IMPRESSION
“Do I really need

Not Yet Upgraded? 
Even if you don’t own a 4K display, 
fret not, the PS4 Pro is still a worthy 
investment. HD TV owners will too 
be able to enjoy enhanced gameplay 
experience. Its delivery of 1080p 
resolution is complemented with a 
higher and more stable frame rate 
for some supported titles. Be warned 
though, older legacy titles may not look 
less awe-inspiring due to this “clarity”. I 
was re-playing Tales of Zesteria, and it 
looked very dated graphically.

From Rags to Riches 
Sony RX1R II
Tiny Package 
Having a small and compact 
camera on hand – instead of my 
trusty Canon 6D - seems to be my 
modus operandi for travel. However, 
most compact sized digital imaging 
devices don’t offer the same 
flexibility and performance as a full-
fledge DSLR. 
This is no longer the case, as the 
possibilities are endless with the 
Sony RX1R II – a professional full-
frame compact camera that nestles 
into your palms comfortably. Just 
slightly bigger and boxier than 
its brethren, the Sony RX100, the 
RX1R II boast of being the ultimate 
compact for enthusiasts and 
professional alike. 
Enjoy the View 
One thing to note about the RX1R II 
is that it now features a tilting screen 
and a pop-up viewfinder – similar to 
the ones you’ll find on the RX100. 
And much like the latter, the RX1R 
II also does not have a touchscreen 
display. Seeing as you’re paying 
close to RM15,000 for the device, 
I would’ve have liked to see more 
features on the RX1R II aside from 
its large megapixels, sophisticated 
PDAF system and full-frame CMOS 
sensor. That’s just me nit-picking 
though…because the value for 
money for me isn’t all that apparent 
right now.
Viewfinder
The RX1R II’s 
electronic viewfinder 
allows you to mimick 
the motion of actually 
taking a photo on 
a DSLR. It features 
corner-to-corner 
visibility on an XGA 
OLED display.
Tilting Screen
Want to shoot at hard 
to manage angles? 
Worry not, the 
RX1R II now comes 
with a tilting screen 
that offers you 109 
degrees up to 41 
degrees down.
The Full Experience 
This camera is not for the faint 
hearted, and it is definitely not for 
beginners who are just dipping their 
toes into photography. Why? Simply 
for its expensive price, in addition 
to its expansive performance and 
features. 
It is a wonderment that Sony has 
managed to fit a full-frame CMOS 
sensor in the RX1R II, marking a 
first for the brand towards offering 
powerful cameras in small sizes. The 
only other camera in the market 
featuring a full-frame sensor is the 
Leica Q, which costs more than the 
RX1R II (if you can believe it).

VERDICT: “The PS4 Pro futureproofs your console, but at a price” - Atifi
Future-proof Gaming 
According to Sony 
Interactive Entertainment 
(SIE), this is the first time in 
the PlayStation history that 
a higher-end system was 
introduced in the middle 
of the platform’s lifecycle. 
And rightly so, seeing as 
4K digital imaging is fast 
becoming a norm in today’s 
TVs and displays. The 
introduction of the PS4 Pro 
is a move that ensures the 
console remains future-proof 
and relevant with the fast 
adoption of better imaging 
quality.

How Do I Do This Again? 
Fiddling and exploring the RX1R II 
is like going on a wild adventure, 
one that you don’t know if you’ll 
survive. There is a steep learning 
curve on which settings to use, or 
rather, you should be using to get 
the optimum performance and 
results. 
The autofocus on the RX1R II 
made me feel like I was playing 
Russian roulette; depending on 
the mode, you’ll be able to hit 
the jackpot….by pure chance. A 
word of disclaimer here: I am not 
a professional photographer; I just 
an idiot who had an expensive toy 
to play with.
Beautiful Output
Having said that, after figuring 
out how to work the RX1R II (and 
finding what are my preferred 
settings), the camera is capable of 
producing amazing images – thanks 
to its extensive dynamic range and 
high ISO performance. Taking still 
life photography in any various 
lighting was made painless by its 
35mm F2 lens. 
Its macro focus range – in manual 
mode - also allows for better control 
and that ever so popular shallow 
depth of field. I enjoyed taking 
portrait shots with the camera, 
thanks to this. 
Taking this to cover an event, 
however, was not a very smart 
choice. Despite having a digital 
zoom, the RX1R II is cumbersome 
on this front. For the maximum 
quality and control, moving closer 
(or farther) to your subject would 
be more prudent. What a love/hate 
relationship I have with the 35mm 
fixed-lens. 
Customised Buttons
A plus point for the RX1R II 
is that you can customise 
the buttons on the top right 
dials to access any one of 
49 different functions. This 
can be set within its settings 
menu.
Keeping Your 
Screen Alive
Whether it’s your calendar, clock or 
even a picture of bae, Samsung’s

All-in-One
Unlike the other Fitbit models, 
the Flex 2 comes packaged 
with two band sizes 
Auto Recognition
The SmartTrack feature allows 
the Flex 2 to auto recognise and 
records the exercise you do to 
the app – from running, cycling to 
swimming; a nifty feature since it 
doesn’t have a display
Colour-Coded
The vertical LED display uses 
colour-coded lights to show 
progress toward your daily goal,

Track Your Day
Brandishing a fitness tracker is all the 
rage now and I too have joined the 
bandwagon. I am no closer to losing 
any weight, but tracking my day has 
given me a sense of achievement 
(and justification to have dessert). The 
Fitbit Flex 2 is a great gateway into 
having a tracker, especially if you still 
prefer wearing your good ol’ watch 
and don’t need a heart-rate monitor. 
Slimmer, Sleeker
The Flex 2, as the name suggest, is 
the second generation of the popular 
model. It is 30% slimmer than its 
predecessor and deviates away 
from the conventional band-style 
fitness trackers. The tracker itself can 
be popped in and out of the sleek 
elastomer band with ease, yet still 
remain secure when intended. It is 
also water-resistant and swim-proof 
of up to 50 meters. I’ve taken it into 
the shower and the pool – it works 
swimmingly well. 
Accessorise Your Tracker
The pill/tablet design on the tracker 
allows you to interchange between 
accessories as easy as 1,2,3! Aside 
from the classic elastomer wristbands, 
Fitbit released some luxury 
accessories that will transform your 
Flex 2 from sporty to chic in no time. 
My favourites are the luxe pendants 
and bangles – a great way to jazz up 
your outfit while still tracking your day. 
That said, for the pendants, features 
like SmartTrack and auto sleep 
tracking are disabled.

Digital Sculptor
Wacom Intuos 3D
De Facto Names
Wacom has always been the brand 
to get when it comes to graphics 
tablets, and for this particular variant 
of the Intuos line, it’s paired itself 
with another big name - Pixologic, 
creators of the immensely popular 
3D sculpting software, ZBrush. With 
the Intuos 3D, you don’t just get a 
tablet, you get a copy of ZBrushCore 
as well as online resources to 
kickstart your journey into 3D 
sculpting.
Traversing Dimensional 
Planes
Make no mistake: despite the “3D” 
moniker attached, this is still just a 
normal Wacom Intuos tablet - which 
means you can still use it for digital 
sketching or some note taking. For 
the newbie, drawing while looking 
at your monitor might seem foreign, 
but give it a few practice runs and 
you’ll be creating masterpieces. The 
pen feels comfortable to wield, and 
the pressure sensitivity detection is 
superb - wouldn’t expect any less 
from a Wacom.
Bad Touch
If there’s one thing I’m not fond of, 
it’s the multi-touch functionality. 
It works… if your palm is hovering 
and not resting on the active area. 
Throughout my testing experience, 
the tablet recognised my resting 
palm as an extra input so some 
gestures didn’t work. It does give 
priority to the pen when it comes 
into play… would be odd if you had 
to draw with a hovering hand. 
Ditch the 
Wire
An optional 
wireless kit lets 
you work with 
more freedom, 
without the USB 
cable getting in 
the way.

you access commonly-used 
features.

Thanks to the design of the watch,

Wander features a metal bracelet 
design, which is a bit more stylish to 
some when compared to a rubber

as the watch face is a bit big for slim 
wrists, so this may not appeal to those 
with smaller statures.

Controlling the Q wander, users have 
several options literally on their wrist. 
The 1.42-inch touch screen is intuitive

just swipe up/down/left/right to get 
to the important bits that you need

gesture-based control – where one 
just need to flick your wrist in the four 
directions to scroll through the cards 
that appears on screen. There is also 
a button on the side of the watch, 
which acts like a back button. The

Almost Depressing
Sony Xperia XZ
Crisp, Sharp & Clear
Being a former Sony Xperia Z3 
owner, one thing I am proud to 
say that Sony does really well is 
its LCD display screens. Dating 
back to the older Z-Series until the 
current X-Series, Sony always outdo 
themselves and the Xperia XZ is no 
exception. Although it is a 1080p 
screen, the 5.2-inch display isn't FHD 
or even QHD for that matter but you 
won't really notice the difference as 
Sony ensures the colour contrast 
in the Xperia XZ is lively, vivid and 
downright outstanding.
Stick To What 
You're Good At
When it comes to creating DSLR 
or even mirrorless cameras, Sony 
has done a very good job for itself 
on that front. Sadly, the same can't 
be said for the cameras featured 
on its smartphone devices as none 
of which have been particularly 
enjoyable to use. Although the 
Xperia XZ does come with a 
23-megapixel rear camera with an 
electronic image stabiliser (EIS), 
it doesn't do itself justice when it 
actually comes to snapping pictures 
as compared to the likes of Huawei 
and Samsung.buttons are easy to 
access… for right-handers (sorry 
southpaws!).
Lasting Longer Than Usual
Much like most smartphone devices 
these days, the Xperia XZ comes 
with an unremovable 2,900mAh 
battery within its core. Although 
not the biggest, it does hold its own 
well enough to last throughout the 
course of the day before needing 
a recharge. What is disappointing 
about the Xperia XZ is that it doesn't 
come with any Fast Charging 
capabilties, unlike its competitors so 
that makes it a bit of a tougher pill 
for customers to swallow. 
Bringing Back
The IP Rating
What Sony failed with 
the Xperia X Compact, 
it definitely made up for 
it with the Xperia XZ as 
it comes with an IP68 
certified rating, ensuring 
it is completely dust proof 
and water-resistant
Staying Away 
From The 
Competition
While most devices 
have its fingerprint 
scanners located either 
on the home button or 
at the rear right below 
the camera, Sony keeps 
itself unique by placing 
the fingerprint scanner 
on the side of the 
device
Same Old, Same Old
One feature that Sony 
has been disappointing 
over and over again is its 
similar, laclustre design

the Xperia XZ looks way 
too much like the Z-Series

f1.9 camera on its front and rear, 
giving my pictures great detail in 
colour as well as during low-lighting 
conditions. Although I’m not a 
huge fan of its Food Mode filter, 
the A7 would be great for all you 
Instagram and Snapchat users who 
are constantly taking pictures of 
their food instead of eating them. 
For a mid-range flagship, the camera 
quality and performance on the A7 is 
great in its own level.
No More Missing the 
Sweet Spot
The A7 comes with the USB 
Type-C port, which allows for 
reversible plug insertion so 
you can now charge it without 
having to fiddle in the dark for 
the right-side up.
Keep it Juiced Up
With 3,600mAh battery 
capacity, the A7 can now last 
longer and even comes with fast 
charging capabilities.
Colour Up Your Life
The A7 comes with four colour 
options, mainly – Black Sky, Gold 
Sand, Peach Cloud and Blue 
Mist; all of which are capable 
of appealing to the everyday 
millennial and everyone else.
Easy Payment Methods
Thanks to Samsung Pay, which is 
now available in Malaysia, you can 
make all your card-less transactions 
through the A7; how cool is that!
Bring It for A Swim 
The A Series finally comes with the 
certified IP68 rating, granting it 
resistance towards water and dust. 
Although this doesn’t apply to its 
predecessors, the Galaxy A7 can be 
submerged for up to 30 minutes and 
up to 1.5 meters of water. If you’re 
extra needy and need to be on the 
phone with your significant other 
all-day, every day, you can now bring 
the A7 with you into the shower 
and not miss out on any of your 
nauseating conversations that you 
find witty but others find revolting.

VERDICT: “Selfie and Vloggers should take a look at this camera” - Atifi
Lightweight Snapper
Canon EOS M10 Kit (EF-M15-45mm IS STM)
Small, Light and Compact
The Canon EOS M10 is an entry-level 
mirrorless camera within the brand’s 
M-series, so to say that it is can be 
compared to the likes of EOS 5D or 
7D is a bit of stretch. However, for 
users who want a fuss-free device 
that’s sits comfortably in between 
a point-and-shoot and a prosumer 
camera, the M10 does the job and 
more thanks to its feature-packed 
disposition. 
Giving Choice 
Canon offers users three variants of 
the M10 kit – the difference between 
the three are the lenses that comes 
bundled with them. The common 
denominator is the EF-M15-45mm IS 
STM lens that comes with all three of 
them. In most cases, this particular 
lens good for wide portraits shots. 
Taking just this to a big scale event 
like CES 2017, while convenient, 
made me realise that the kit zoom 
lens would’ve come in handy. 
However, that’ll set you back another 
RM1,200, which could get you the 
EOS M3 Kit with EF-M18-55 IS STM 
(and some change). 
Vlogger’s Best Friend
The M10 features a 180° tilt-able 
touchscreen LCD that makes taking 
selfies a breeze. If you’re into 
recording daily vlogs, this particular 
camera will not only make your 
task easier, the quality of the video 
(and photo) is above average for 
uploading. Personally, I hardly used 
the tilt feature throughout the 
review, but can definitely see the 
merits if I was a vlogger (or a selfie 
addict, hmm).  
Side Card
Unlike most digital 
cameras, the EOS 
M10 has a dedicated 
memory card slot on 
the side instead of next

Performing Well 
Above The Average
When it comes to using the A7 on a 
daily basis, I would say it performs 
remarkably well for a mid-range device. 
From juggling between my nightly 
Instagram and Snapchat creeping to 
Spotify, YouTube and even Netflix, 
the A7 does a great job in keeping up 
with my daily routine. A downside to 
having so many applications running 
simultaneously does cause it to heat up 
but that’s when you dunk it in a bucket 
of water to cool it off.
Slowly Becoming 
A Fan Again
I used to be a proud owner of a Galaxy 
S3 many years ago and although it did 
serve its purpose, I was never truly a 
fan of it as there were so many kinks 
and bugs with the phone that it just 
deterred me away from Samsung, 
forever. Fast forward to the present, I 
am beginning to like what Samsung 
has to offer, even if the A7 isn’t its high-
end smartphone, it only begins to show 
what Samsung can bring to the table 
after the S7 Edge and I am waiting with 
baited breath for that. 
Keeping Your 
Screen Alive
Whether it’s your calendar, clock or 
even a picture of bae, Samsung’s 
Always On Display allows you to 
know what’s going on without

The Everywhere Compact
Sony RX100 IV
Pocket Friendly Design
This small, magnesium-alloy camera 
fits into pockets easily and the 
smooth, grip-less metal means 
the camera means there’s less for 
your fingers to hold on to but the 
RX100 IV is fairly easy to handle. 
However, a wrist strap is definitely 
recommended to avoid heat of the 
moment accidents. Despite its small 
stature, the manual control dial on 
the back and a wheel around the 
lens means allows you to have full-on 
manual control.  
Eye-Opening Video 
The RX100 IV will record 4K video 
at a very impressive bit rate of 
100Mbps if you have a card fast 
enough but fret not as there a 
plethora of resolution and bitrate 
options for those who don’t wish to 
upgrade to a speedier card. If you 
do have a fast card, the high frame 
rate mode allows you to shoot at 3 
speeds, 250, 500 and 1000 frames 
per second in Full HD! 
Built-in ND Filter
The 3-stop ND filter allows for longer 
exposure times during the day and full use 
of the lens’ capabilities wherever you go
Precise Composition
The pop-up electronic viewfinder reveals the 
subtlest details during composition due to a 
high resolution of 2.3 million dots
Lightning Fast Sensor 
Sony’s new stacked sensor is a 
world first and features higher signal 
processing quality which translates 
to a sensor so fast, it goes beyond 
human perception. This allows for 
a shutter speed of 1/32000 sec, 
40x super slow motion video and 
a burst mode capable of 16fps. 
The incredibly fast shutter speed 
allows for photos that utilise a large 
aperture under extremely bright 
conditions.

Battery powerhouse
Asus Zenfone 3 Max
Performance killer
As for performance – that is where 
the Max doesn’t quite deliver, despite 
having an octa core to its spec sheet. 
While you certainly can do daily 
tasks of messaging, navigation, and 
perhaps take photos without much 
of a glitch – prolonged usage and 
switching between applications 
tends to stun the phone. Heavy users 
will feel rather frustrated after your 
phone freezes twice an hour.
Picture perfect
The 16MP rear camera holds up well 
with clear crisp pictures under bright 
lighting. In darker conditions, there is 
a low-light mode which does a pretty 
good job of reducing noise. With 
aperture set at f 2.0, it holds up well 
for close-ups, but it does take some 
patience getting the camera to focus 
at the correct subject. For the selfie 
kings and queens, the 8MP front 
camera caters well for all your social

you could charge other devices

New Marshal in Town
Fossil Q Marshal
Fashionable Wearable
Android Wear has usually been the 
domain of tech manufacturers, so 
having fashion brand Fossil enter 
the fray was quite the surprise - how 
would a fashion brand approach 
wearables? From the Q Marshal, it’s 
doing quite a good job. Its aesthetic is 
very similar to a fashionable timepiece, 
looking like it could fit right in a watch 
collection. Not too shabby.
Style Over Substance
The Q Marshal does some other things 
right, and some… not so much. It looks 
the part, but the bezel and crown 
do not rotate, with the crown only 
housing a home button. It rocks the 
“flat-tire” display from the early days 
of Android Wear, and the wireless 
charging connection works very well, 
killing the need for visible pogo pins, 
but you’d better not lose the cable.
Wary About Wear
The Q Marshal runs on Android Wear 
(not 2.0… yet, during the time of this 
review), limitations and all. Confined 
to just basic notification mirroring 
and simple controls, Android Wear 
isn’t going to win over new converts 
just yet, unless you’re really into 
fitness. Even then, the Q Marshal 
lacks a heart rate sensor. That said, if 
you’re looking for a fancy wearable, 
the Q Marshal is it.  
Swap it Out
The Q Marshal uses standard 
22mm watch straps, so whether 
it be metal, leather or silicon, 
swapping straps is a breeze.
Sink and Swim
With IP67 certification, the 
Q Marshal can withstand the 
occasional downpour - no need 
to worry when you’re out and 
about when wearing it.

Gearing Up For Greatness
Illegear Z5
big as heck
Sleek Metallic Design
What the Z5 lacked in gaming 
performance (which isn't really 
much; I just have insanely high 
standards), it makes up for in its 
unique design. It's 15.6-inch Full 
HD display comes with anti-glare 
capabilities, removing any strain 
from your eyes. It's entire body is 
wrapped in metallic silver with black 
accent finishing, giving off a rugged 
look that says "don't even think 
about messing with me."
Great Keyboard
I am not a fan of laptop keyboards 
in general, I've always preferred the 
use of an external keyboard due to 
my love for mechanical switches. 
With that being said, the keyboard 
on the Z5 does hold its own quite 
well, making it quite comfortable for 
me to type and even game in. This is 
partially due to the large palm rest on 
the body as I have abnormally large 
hands. 
Still Great
The Z5 
comes with 
the GeForce 
GTX1060 
GPU, which 
is currently 
the middle

for modern 
gaming GPUs
Large 
Touchpad
Another great 
thing about the 
Z5 is its large

Trying To Keep Up
One of the things I admire about 
Illegear is its passion towards 
gaming laptops, especially when I 
had a personal hands-on experience 
with the D9X. Sadly, the same 
can't be said for the Illegear Z5 as 
it just isn't on the same. Although 
it is in the more affordable range 
as compared to the D9X, it just 
barely made the cut after running 
it through the benchmarks tests. 
However, running it on non-graphic 
heavy games like Dota 2, CS:GO 
and Overwatch, the Z5 performs 
exceptionally well with no frame rate 
drops or frame stuttering.

HTC Desire 10 Pro
Classy Design
HTC has thought of everything with 
the HTC Desire 10 Pro. It has some 
high-end design that will not look 
out of place on a flagship device. 
It has gold trim all around, and the 
soft-touch back is very luxurious 
for its level. We like all of the small 
touches that HTC has managed to 
think for the phone.
Mid-range Power 
Mid-range is all the numbers here, 
as the Desire 10 Pro features the

is not the highest end possible but 
it is more than enough for daily use 
and occasional intense processing. 
The 4GB of RAM will certainly help in

The large 5.5-inch full HD display

Dual Camera for everyone
Honor 6X
Value performance
Thanks to the HiSIlicon Kirin 655 
processor, the Honor 6X blazes 
through normal apps like it is 
designed to be a faster processor. 
The eight cores certainly helps in this 
regards, as well as the 3GBs of RAM. 
The combination of two ensures that 
the phone does not feel laggy – even 
while playing intensive games on 
the go. Plus, you get an eight-core 
processer at this price! A steal!.
Dual camera magic
Not only you get a very decent 
8-megapixel camera sensor at the 
front for (almost) flawless selfies, 
the dual camera sensor at the back 
gives you a different take on mobile 
photography than before. The 
12-megapixel sensor takes the image, 
while the secondary 2-megapxiel 
sensor records depth information – so 
you can emulate lens bokeh in the 
phone! Artsy images here we come.
Large screen entertainment
The large 5.5-inch full HD display 
on the front means that every 
multimedia file you have stored in 
the phone will look gorgeous and 
expansive, thanks to the large screen. 
While it is no AMOLED display, the 
IPS panel reproduces colour vibrantly 
and consistently – making it a dream 
using it even in the bright sunlight.

A Mid Ranger with Attitude
Wiko uFeel Go
Looking Beyond Its Price
The first thing that came to mind 
is that the phone looks and feels 
beyond its paygrade. The finishing 
is top notch, and if you do not know 
better you would be hard pressed to 
tell anyone that this is not a nigh-end 
premium smartphone for the masses. 
Even the weight is substantial – 
making it feel more luxurious than its 
price would suggest.
Good Performance vs 
Value 
You get a device that is essentially a 
mid-tier phone and the performance 
is par for the course – but the 
performance is more in the top tier 
band of the mid-tier range. You will 
not get the fastest and greatest 
chip in the market, but for what it is 
the phone is more than enough for 
the average consumer. So you can 
emulate lens bokeh in the phone! 
Artsy images here we come.
Good Features Combo

Sometimes what you need is a 
phone that is more than the sum

certainly one of those machines.

Kworld S25 Earphones
Built For Your Games
The sound quality of the Kworld S25 
gaming earphones are surprisingly 
amazing; I could pick up every subtle 
note perfectly clear, making it a 
great accessory to have when you're 
gaming. For Counter Strike: Global 
Offensive (CSGO) in particular, these 
earphones are a lifesaver as you can 
even pick up the footsteps of your 
enemies around you, giving you that 
slight advantage over them.
Great For Music As Well 
Although the S25 isn't a noise-
cancelling pair of earphones, it does 
hold itself up pretty well when it 
comes to drowning out unnecessary 
noise. Running it through my own 
personal playlist, it was particularly 
great when it comes to heavy metal 
as well as electronic music. However, 
it didn't do so well for R&B and Hip-
Hop but it was good enough to meet 
my expectations.
The Size Of A Bullet
The size of the earcups are literally 
9mm in diameter, making it the 
same size as a bullet. Although the 
design of the S25 isn't for anyone, 
it did strike an appeal for me as 
it definitely stands out from the 
various other earphones that you will 
find in the market. The earphones 
are also pretty sturdy so you know 
for sure it can handle a beating 
without wearing out quickly.

Display
The 6-inch IPS-NEO LCD capacitive 
touchscreen display has a resolution 
of 1080 x 1920 pixels, which is 
something brought forward from its 
predecessor. When it was launched, 
most flagships in its class have 
moved on to QHD resolution, leaving 
us to wonder why didn’t the Mate 8 
followed suit? Perhaps this was the 
only niggling issue of the Huawei 
Mate 8. That said, the display does 
the job perfectly for everyday use. 
Images are crisps and colours are 
accurate.
Hardware
Hardware-wise, the Huawei Mate 8 
was one of the top performers when 
it was launched. The HiSilicon Kirin 
950, paired with the Mali-T990 MP4 
GPU, allowed the device to be nippy 
and snappy – no problems in multi-
tasking it at all.It has gold trim all 
around, and the soft-touch back is 
very luxurious for its level. We like 
all of the small touches that HTC has 
managed to think for the phone.
Camera
Huawei’s partnership with Leica 
only bore fruition well after the 
release of the Huawei Mate 8. As 
such, the device doesn’t sport the 
now quintessential dual-lens camera 
the brand is now known for. That 
said, the Mate 8 doesn’t fall short 
on taking great photos, thanks to its 
16-megapixel f/2.0 primary camera. 
The front camera was decent, but 
was slow in focusing.

Primed & Ready
Wiko UFeel Prime
How Does It Fair?
Having already placed themselves 
in the top 5 of smartphone brands 
across Europe, Wiko is steadily taking 
over the globe, one continent at a 
time. It has now set its sight upon 
Asia as its next target with the Wiko 
UFeel Prime, it's premium flagship 
device with entry-level to mid-range 
specifications. We take the UFeel 
Prime for a run through the lab to see 
how it would fair.
Not Quite What I Expected 
To hear of a brand that broke into 
the top 5 smartphone brands in 
Europe, you would expect it to be 
within the same grasp as the other 
frontrunners. Sadly on that front, 
Wiko still has much to do. Although 
the benchmark scores say otherwise 
(its very subpar), day-to-day usage 
of the UFeel Prime is perfectly fine, 
capable of running multiple apps at 
once without any lag issues.
Easy Access To Your Apps
One feature from the UFeel Prime 
that I did find quite useful was its 
customisable fingerprints, which 
allows you to alocate one fingerprint 
for a specific app. Now you can have 
five apps ready and raring to go 
with just a touch. However, I don't 
agree with the placement of the 
fingerprint scanner as I am far more 
accustomed to it being at the back 
of the device rather than the front. 
Snap Away 
The rear camera 
on the UFeel 
Prime comes with 
a 13-megapixel 
Sony 258 IMX 
Sensor and 5P

Display
Like the Huawei Mate 8, the Mate 
9 still features a 1080 x 1920pixel 
resolution display. A stark difference 
between the two is that the latter 
doesn’t sport an IPS-NEO LCD panel 
anymore and the size is reduced 
ever so slightly at a meagre 0.1-inch. 
Still feels gigantic in my hands. For 
reference, I’m currently using the 
Huawei P9 Plus. Still wondering if 
the Mate series will ever get a QHD 
display, just saying. 
Camera
Perhaps the most obvious change 
between the Mate 8 and Mate 9 is 
the camera. The Mate 9 now features 
Huawei’s hallmark partnership 
with Leica, in the form of the dual 
cameras. Previously, the Leica 
branded mobile dual cameras were 
only available on its P9 series, 
however the Mate 9 features a higher 
resolution black & white sensor as 
compared to the former. The lenses 
are also stacked vertically, rather 
than side by side. Another point to 
note is that the Mate 9 is capable of 
recording 4K video. 
Hardware
Its latest rendition of the Mate series 
offers users more power and better 
performance as it houses the latest 
Kirin 960 chipset and Mali G71 GPU. 
A little trivia, the same chipset is 
being used in the latest Huawei P10 
range. The Mate 9 also houses a huge 
4,000mAh battery within its vessel, 
and further enhanced by its fast 
charging (SuperCharge) capabilities 
and newly added USB-C connectivity. 
Fast charging made faster.

headset cradles on 
both sides of the PC,

your headphones 
with ease and not 
leaving them lying 
around on the table
Straight Out Of 
A Sci-Fi Movie
Looking much more like an alien 
rather than a predator (fans of the 
movie will get what I mean), the 
Acer Predator G1 comes with a 
ferocious outlook, much like an alien 
spaceship from the distant future. Its 
casing is somewhat reminiscent of 
the exoskeleton you can see in the 
Transformers movie series, particularly 
the Decepticons due to its menacing 
and evil outlook. Although great to 
look at intially, it did slowly grow on 
me and I got accustomed to it.
Behaves Like A Predator
This pint-sized behemoth is not to 
be messed with; the outstanding 
component would be the inclusion 
of the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 
GPU, giving you VR-ready capabilities 
so you can game with a next-level 
immersive experience. The G1 is also 
packed with the 6th Gen. Intel Core 
i7-6700 quad-core processor for even 
quicker and smoother daily usability. 
In terms of storage, the G1 is capable 
of holding up to 512GB of SSD storage 
while also coming with standardised 
2TB HDD.
Putting It Through The Test
It was pretty exciting to run the 
G1 through the benchmarks tests 
to see how well it would fair and 
sadly, it didn't really live up to the 
expectations I've come to set from 
Acer. Although I'm pretty sure the G3 
and G6 would've done a much better 
job, the G1 just pales in comparison as 
even running it through the Rise of the 
Tomb Raider benchmark, it topped up 
at just under 60 FPS, which is pretty 
disappointing for a system running on 
the latest GPU.

Misfit Shine 2
Simple, low maintenance
Unlike other fitness trackers and 
smartwatches, the Misfit Shine 2 
doesn’t require any recharging. The 
replaceable battery lasts for 6 months 
so you can put it on and forget about 
it for months before needing to 
replace the batteries. The Shine 2 is 
also waterproof – so you can easily 
track your swim, as well as wear it in 
the shower no problem! If you’re like 
me, you can pop the tracker on and 
not worry about forgetting to take it 
off and ruining it.
Buzz buzz
The tracker buzzes and acts as a 
notification when connected to your 
phone. It will buzz and flash LED 
when you receive a text message or 
a phone call. You can also set the 
time for the alarm, and the tracker 
will wake you up gently with buzzes. 
With a separate app, you can use the 
tracker as a smart button to control 
music, take selfie or control you home 
devices.

VERDICT: 
Not Enough Ports
Thanks to the inclusion of the GTX 
1080 GPU, it makes the G1 VR-ready, 
which means more ports will be taken 
up for the VR headset and such. With 
only four USB ports located at the 
back of the casing and an additional 
port located at the front, it surely 
doesn't seem like much. The silver 
lining is the inclusion of the USB 
Type-C port located at the front of the 
casing, allowing you to charge your 
smart device without having to move 
from the PC.
Superior Gaming Out of the Box
Unlike the typical generic accessories that you will usually get (which I hate), the G1 provides you with the Predator 
Flare mechanical keyboard with customisable backlight keys and a Predator gaming mouse. Although not as audible as 
Cherry MX switches, the keys on the Predator Flare are much softer than expected; it also makes typing much easier. 
Personally, I'm not a fan of the Predator gaming mouse as its much smaller compared to plenty of other brands so my 
palm fully covers the mouse, making my movements slow and uncomfortable.  
Quicker and Easier 
Networking
Thanks to the installation 
of the Killer DoubleShot 
Pro, the G1 can intelligently 
split your LAN data 
between cable and

for optimised Internet 
connectivity
Unorthodox Power

Much like laptops, the G1 is 
powered by two seperate 
power bricks, which must

The Aztech IP Cam App allows you 
to connect four wireless IP cameras. 
They don’t all have to be in the

as their IP addresses have been 
registered to your app. This makes 
monitoring or surveillance much

The WIPC411HD is useful to have if 
you’d like an eagle-eye view of its 
surrounding. It can pan up to 355° 
and tilt 120°, which can be controlled 
through the app in real time, so you’ll 
be able to see most angles. If you 
catch your colleague dozing off, there 
is a built-in speaker to gently remind 
them that “big brother is watching”. 
Well, they could also try to give their 
excuse back at you since the camera 
has an internal mic.

Still the King
MSI GTX 1080 Gaming X
T
he pascal 10 series GPU from 
NVIDIA is still the king of 
graphic performance right 
now. And depending on the 
manufacturers, it does come in a 
variety of different flavours. Each 
manufacturers have changed the 
graphic card to what they think it’s 
best, and many of them has evolved 
massively different from the founders 
edition that NVIDIA has originally 
launched. One of those card is from 
MSI, namely the GTX 1080 Gaming 
X variant. So what kind of personal 
touches has MSI blessed this card 
with? Let’s find out.
Dragon Rising
The MSI GTX 1080 Gaming X comes 
in a nice large red box with a large 
image of the graphic card itself in 
front of the board. The card itself 
comes in a nice foam casing. The 
card itself is half red and half black, 
with an all black PCB which we 
think looks cool. There is a large 
aluminium backplate installed on 
the rear of the card to help with 
heat dissipation as well as making 
sure the card does not sag under

The card is fitted with one 6-pin and 
one 8-pin power connector with a 
power consumption rating of 180w. 
The dual power input means that you 
still have headroom to overclock this 
card if you want to using the included 
MSI Afterburner software.
At the rear you will get one Dual 
Link DVI, one HDMI 2.0 and three 
Display Port 1.4a connectors. The 
card support three separate displays 
at once, if triple screen surround is 
your thing. 
If Virtual Reality is your thing, then the MSI GTX 1080 Gaming X is certainly 
VR capable, and currently is the best VR capable graphic card on the market. 
With the right motherboard you can pair this baby up with either an Oculus 
Rift or HTC VIVE for a smooth and fast VR experience.

Brings Your Enemies To The Afterlife
Gamdias Hermes P1 RGB Keyboard
Obvious Clickbait
As a personal preference, I am a 
big fan of Cherry MX mechanical 
switches rather than a brand’s own 
interpretation. Except for Logitech, I 
have not been thoroughly impressed 
with other brands like Razer, and 
Gamdias is no exception. The 
actuation force on the Gamdias 
Hermes P1 is above average at best 
but the clicks are a lot more audible 
compared to the Gamdias Hermes 
RGB. Overall, it is great for gaming 
and typing but it’s not the ideal 
keyboard I would want.
Keeping Your Macros In 
Check 
If you’re a hardcore gamer with 
plenty of different macro profiles 
to suit your games and playstyles, 
the Hermes P1 is great since you 
can store up to six different profiles 
into the keyboard’s built-in 32bit 
ARM CortexTM-M3 microprocessor. 
Whether its Skyrim, Diablo III or even 
World of Warcraft, you can have 
macro profiles for all your games, 
giving you greater flexibility with

A Great Alternative
Aside from the goliaths like Razer, 
SteelSeries and Corsair who are the 
top echelons of gaming peripherals, 
I would Gamdias around the same 
league as Logitech, which is right 
below the top brands. For the price

Gamdias HEBE M1
Booming Bass Drops
Whether it's listening to electronic, 
heavy metal or even EDM, the 
Gamdias HEBE M1 has a booming 
bass drop that just can't be found 
in any other pair of headphones. 
Even when gaming, the M1 gives 
great audio feedback, allowing you 
to catch even the faintest hints of 
your surroundings, making it almost 
impossible for your enemies to sneak 
up on you.
Insanely Huge Driver Unit 
The M1 comes with a 50mm HD

effects with a rich bass. They weren't 
lying when they said it was HD; 
running the M1 through my playlist 
never sounded so good before. I 
tested out the M1 for Skyrim and 
Uncharted 4; the ambience noise 
is amazing on them. Pristine and 
crystal clear, you can pick up birds 
chirping from afar while still being

One thing I thoroughly dislike about 
the M1 is its size. Although It does 
perform well on a day-to-day basis, 
its far too heavy to have on one's

you're a hardcore gamer like me.

Living Up To Its Namesake
MSI GP62M Leopard Pro Gaming Laptop
Up To Date 
As how MSI usually is, all its gaming 
laptops are always up to date when 
it comes to current events and 
keeping in touch with the latest 
technological advancements. The 
GP62M is no different as it now 
comes with the latest Intel has 
to offer, its 7th Gen. Intel Core i7 
processor. Paired with NVIDIA’s 
latest GTX 1050 GPU, the GP62M 
is a beast of a gaming laptop at a 
reasonable price.
Any and Every Excuse to 
Game
The GTX1050 in the GP62M makes 
my games look amazing. Playing 
Dota 2 and Overwatch and watching 
my team feed and throw the game 
away didn’t look as bad as the game 
in its own right was just great to look 
at. It also helps that MSI made sure 
the monitor is an IPS-level display, 
giving the games greater colour and 
sharpness. Take my word for it, play 
Battlefield 1 on this, you won’t regret 
it.
New Is Always Better
Although SteelSeries manufactured 
keyboards on MSI gaming laptops 
aren’t new, it does come with silver-
lining print, giving them much more 
durability.
Only One Click Away
With just a push of a button, 
you can turn on six heat pipes 
and dual fans, which will 
actively push the heat out of 
the system, making sure the 
GP62M always stays cool. 
Multiple Monitors
If you were keeping tabs on Razer 
and its technological advancement 
with its Razer Valerie Prototype, 
you can also do the same with the 
GP62M. Well, somewhat. With the 
Matrix Display, you can plug in an 
additional two external monitors, 
bringing your gaming experience 
to another level. To take things up 
a notch, the Matrix Display also 
supports 4K resolution output so 
your movies and AAA games will look 
glorious even if your gameplay isn’t.

Sound is Vital
Zowie Vital 
Plug-and-Play Instantly
With most generic USB sound cards 
coming with drivers and programs 
that have to be installed before being 
able to use them, the Zowie Vital 
comes with a quick plug-and-play 
method so you don't have to waste 
time looking for the driver or program. 
On the touchscreen display, you can 
adjust the volume, microphone, treble 
and bass levels of your headset with 
just a push of a button.
Not As Interactive 
As You Think
Although it does sound like a great 
device, the Zowie Vital has a lot to 
work on before it becomes a hit. 
For one, the response time for the 
interactive touchscreen is pretty 
slow; I have to press on bass a few 
times before it actually responds 
and don't get me started on how 
I managed to control the volume. 
Although not as annoying as most 
people would think, I'd like to be 
able to change my audio settings 
quickly and without any delay.
Take Your Pick
If you prefer to not have your 
headset blaring but your speakers 
instead, you can choose to latter 
as the Zowie Vital comes with 3 
audio ports in total for your headset, 
microphone and of course your 
speakers. To switch, just press the 
speaker button on the touchscreen 
and your music will be redirected to 
the speakers that are plugged in. You 
can also lock the screen to reduce 
the amount of light coming from it 
or even mute your microphone. 
Pocket-Sized Power
Roughly the size of a deck of 
cards, the Zowie Vital packs a 
mean punch especially when it 
came to music and gaming

Blame It On The Lag No More 
Gone are the days where you can blame your 
deaths and misplays on the lag. The GP62M 
comes with the Killer Ethernet E2500 Gaming 
Lan chipset so it can prevent your networking 
traffic from lag spikes. I for one saw no need for 
this as I still blame it on the lag with every death 
in the game (sue me). But if you actually take 
your gaming seriously, this will help stabilise your 
connection while still getting relatively low ping 
rate.
Balance Its Performance 
Thanks to MSI’s exclusive ‘Shift’ 
technology, you can now switch 
between four different PC profiles 
so you can make the most out of 
your time with the GP62M. Switch 
to Comfort or Eco mode when you 
just want lower fan speed noise 
and temperature while working or 
watching movies; save Turbo and 
Sports mode for when you want to 
go all out. 
Keeping It Classy
The GP62M is easy on the eye; its metallic chassis

have and to hold for the rest of your life (much like a

1000Mbps is the theoretical speed 
that the AC5300 can deliver over 
the 2.4Ghz band – of course it is 
depending on the wireless card that

of this high connectivity is that the 
data stream is constant and consistent 
even at high transfer loads. Plus, the 
router supports Multiple In Multiple Out

is not just for show!).

You get not two, but three Wifi 
Band – 2.4GHz and two 5GHz bands

You get four Gigabit ethernet ports, 
a USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 port and 
a physical switch that allows the 
AC5300 to work as a router or a

Customization King
Not only the router works great with 
the included software, it is also able 
to support DD-WRT OpenSource

Soldier On
The MSI Krait Gaming is a full sized 
ATX motherboard. It comes in a nor-
mal sized box featuring some cool 
looking snake scales on the front, 
which make sense since a Krait is a 
type of snake.  
We love the MSI Krait Gaming 
motherboard colour scheme. It has a 
nice balance of black and white. This 
means that it should nicely fit either 
black or white casing. It accepts any 
socket 1151 processor, which means 
the new Kaby Lake as well as Skylake 
processors can be used.

Keeping It Clean
Klipsch Reference Over-Ear Bluetooth Headphones
Perfect For Every Genre
Whether it’s classical, smooth jazz, 
deep house or even heavy metal, 
the Klipsch Reference is perfect for 
even the most ardent audiophile 
imaginable. After giving it a run 
through my playlist, I was thoroughly 
impressed, which says a lot seeing 
as I’m not easily impressed with 
headphones. ‘Master of Puppets’ 
in particular was amazing on the 
Klipsch Reference, making me 
instantly regret not going for their 
live concert.
Fit For Every Ear 
I hate the feeling of having heavy 
pressure over your ears when you 
have headphones on for long hours. 
Although not as light as I thought, 
the Klipsch Reference is still a decent 
pair, thanks to its memory foam 
ear cushions. My ears don’t ache as 
much and it doesn’t make my brain 
feel like it’s being constricted. Having 
it on for three hours straight, I could 
barely notice the pressure that was 
applied until I took it off. If drowning 
your sorrows in music is your thing, 
you know where to look.
Great When You’re On-The-Go
Not only does the Klipsch Reference 
work over wireless Bluetooth 
connection, it also allows you to 
pick up calls through in the controls 
located on the left earcup. Not 
only that, you can also control your 
playlist with the controls and even 
the volume. If Bluetooth isn’t your 
thing, the Klipsch Reference also 
comes with a connecting cable. 
The battery lifespan is also not 
too shabby, giving me a good five 
to seven hours on a single charge 
alone. 
A Snug And Comfortable 
The headband is also fitted with memory 
foam padding so you can rest easy knowing 
your ears are in good hands.comfortable in 
the hand, as there are no real sharp corners
Everywhere & 
Anywhere
Thanks to its 
retractable earcups, 
the Klipsch Reference 
comes with a sturdy zip 
carrying case so you 
can bring it everywhere 
and anywhere.
Much More To 
Offer
A very 
straightforward 
product with only 
two colours to 
choose from (black 
or white), I wish 
there was more to 
the headphones 
than just that.

Segotep GP600G Modular PSU
Powered On
Segotep is a Chinese PC peripheral 
company that is making inroads in 
South East Asia. There seems to be 
an official store on Lazada as well as 
an Facebook page, altho the official 
website is still entirely in Chinese. 
While they are mostly known as a 
casing manufacturer, they also make 
power supplies as well, and in our 
labs today we have the Segotep 
GP600G modular power Supply.
Black Box 
The power supply comes in a matte 
black rectangular box. The GP600G 
is prominently featured in gold 
letterings all over the box, as well as 
an 80 Plus Gold logo. 
Note that there is no specs or 
features AT ALL on the box. Only the 
name and a link to Segotep’s official 
WeChat account. 
Open Sesame!
Opening the box, we are greeted 
with the Segotep GP600G PSU 
inside a velvet like tie bag. Since this 
is a modular power supply, there is 
a second box that contains all the 
cables that you would connect the 
PSU with. We took out the PSU and 
upon closer inspection, we were 
surprised that it’s actually rated at 
500W. With all the GP600G branding 
all over the box, we would have swore 
that this is a 600W PSU. Nope. 
Colours of the Wind 
There is surprisingly a lot of modular 
selections for the GP600G modular 
PSU here. Included in the box are 
eight SATA connectors split into 
two cables, six molex connectors 
split into two cables, four eight pin 
GPU power connectors split into 
two cables, as well as two four pin 
motherboard power connectors and 
one 24 pin power connectors

Capture everything in 
360 degrees and 4K
360fly 4K
Standard mountings  
The 360fly 4K is one of the many 
360-degree cameras that is now 
flooding the market. What makes 
this camera different is the design – 
the lens is situated on the top of the 
device and captures everything with 
only a single lens. Plus, the camera 
comes with a standard 1/4inch 
thread so it can be screwed into any 
tripod with ease
All-around photo 
Connect the 360fly 4K to your 
smartphone, and snap away. Our big 
comment is that the pairing step can 
take a bit of time to establish – we 
once had to wait over 30 seconds for 
the app to see the camera. But once 
it is set up, the image taking is as 
simple as pressing a button. 
Simple operation  
The 360fly 4K is easy to use, as 
there is no other button than the 
power/record button on the unit 
itself. It is purely done with the app, 
so the operator can be away from 
the device as it records. Plus, the 
64GB of internal storage means that 
your 4K video files will have enough 
space in the device even if you are 
away from a computer for the day. 
Futuristic 
design 
The angular 
design of the

False Sense of Freedom
Jabra Halo Free
Ready to Go
Taking cue from its ever-popular 
Jabra Sport earbuds, the brand 
introduces a wireless Bluetooth 
earbuds made for those on-the-
go. The Jabra Halo Free allows for 
greater flexibility and convenience 
when you’re out and about – no 
more constantly reaching for your 
phone to make or answer a call. 
Short Battery Life
The Jabra Halo Free isn’t a pair 
of earbuds that you could rely on 
to play your tunes. Its battery life 
is only good and lasting if you’re 
just answering or making calls. 
I found that it’ll only last up to 
a maximum of two hours if I’m 
streaming my Spotify through the 
Halo Free, which is a bummer. While 
productivity is probably the main 
selling point for these earbuds, 
carrying a separate pair of earbuds 
or headphones kind of defeats the 
purpose. On this front, maybe its 
Jabra Halo Smart would be a better 
value-for-money choice.
Wireless Connectivity 
While the earbuds are connected via a wire, 
the Jabra Halo Free allows for a fuss-free, 
wireless connectivity to your smartphone
Different Fits
Jabra offers three 
wearing styles 
that are easily 
interchangeable. 
The EarGels and 
EarHooks are great 
for a basic fit, but 
the EarWings is a 
better choice for a 
more secure fit.

Buttons for Most Scenarios
There are four buttons on the mic/

are your usual volume up, volume 
down and the pause (or on/off)

Oh, Brother
Brother MFC-L5900DW 
Laser Quality Text
If you’re looking for a constantly 
smooth and crisp printing for 
documents, the monochrome 
multifunction printer Brother MFC-
L5900DW is your best bet. The 
printer certainly makes printing out 
a 30-page test document (i.e. my 
report) a breeze. The first printout 
seems to be fairly quick at 7 to 8 
seconds, with the subsequent pages 
following suit right after without a 
hitch.  
A Tad Disappointing  
However, when it comes to printing 
out images, pictures and graphics, 
there were a lot of details lost when 
it is converted to monochrome. 
If you’re thinking of printing 
presentation slides in black and 
white, you may want to do a quick 
test print before proceeding with 
the lot. That said, in a traditional 
office setting, printing out images 
in monochrome isn’t a norm so this 
Connecting Woes
I had intended to connect the MFC-
L5900DW to our office network 
through Wi-Fi, but due to some 
incompatibility with our router at the 
time, it was proving to be a challenge. 
I personally feel that to maximise its 
potential in bigger offices, technicians 
from Brother need to be the ones 
setting up the system. It is definitely 
not for small-to-medium businesses 
who want a plug-and-play kind of

 Maximising Print Productivity
Canon MAXIFY MB5470 
Maximum Speed  
 The MB5470 delivers fast print 
speeds: printing a 30-page 
monochrome report was done in 
about a minute with minimal warm-
up. It comes equipped with a wider 
print head, and this is paired with a 
unique overlapping paper feeding 
technology. The printer draws the 
second sheet to be printed and 
overlaps it with the first sheet, which 
increases the print speed. A very 
good performance for something its 
size.
True to Colour  
The MB5470 delivers more than 
just crisp and darker than black ink 
printouts, its coloured printing is 
no lightweight either. The colours 
are vibrant without oversaturating 
the paper. While the first printout 
for colour takes a little longer 
but significantly faster than its 
competitors. At most, you’ll have to 
wait for 10 seconds before it comes 
out.  
Easy Set-Up  
What I found to be a boon for the 
MB5470 is how easy it was to set-up. 
Connecting a new printer and have it 
seen across the network – especially 
wirelessly – can be a pain in the 
arse. The instructions provided were 
more than sufficient for me to set 
it up as a network printer via Wi-Fi 
connectivity quickly and swiftly.

Having been a household name for quite some time now to many gamers, 
MSI has been at the forefront of gaming laptop technology, always 
looking to break from the mould by doing something completely different from 
everyone else. To kick-start this showdown, we have the MSI GT62VR Dominator

Design
Inspired after matte black supercars, the GT62VR would catch the eye of other 
gamers as well as non-gamers thanks to its brushed metallic aesthetic. Its red 
accents overlapping the brushed-metal lid also provides a subtle nod towards 
MSI, especially for those who will recognise that shade of red. The GT62VR is 
also incredibly light while remaining capable of performing at the highest level.
Performance
One of the unique selling points of the GT62VR is its VR gaming capabilities as it 
is the first gaming laptop from MSI that is VR-ready. Now you can game in virtual 
reality without the need of a console. Powered by the GTX 10 Series GPU, this 
laptop was amazing for gaming, no matter what game it was. Although Dota 
2 and Overwatch ran seamlessly, Skyrim and Diablo III were simply amazing, 
garnering over 100 FPS.
Daily Usage
When it comes to watching movies or even tuning out the world with your music, 
you’ll be amazed at what the GT62VR has to offer. Fitted with Dynaudio speakers, 
your cinema experience will forever be changed. The GT62VR also comes with a 
15.6-inch display screen with UHD (ultra-high definition) resolution, making your 
movies look even better than before. Even the keyboard feels amazing as it comes 
from SteelSeries, who are famous for its gaming peripherals.
Price
Priced at RM9,999, the GT62VR sets the tone for how much gaming laptops would 
cost these days in the market. Although I would reconsider getting it due to its 
high price point, the GT62VR is definitely worth every penny spent as it is one of 
the top gaming laptops to have with you.

Samsung J2 Prime
he entry from the largest smartphone manufacturer is also the larger 
models in this month’s showdown. The Samsung J2 Prime brings to the 
table a few features that is not shared with the other competitors in the 
list. Unfortunately, one of the feature that Samsung used in this phone 
is the non-HD screen – at only 540 x 960 pixels ; this low-resolution screen may 
be a detractor for some potential customers to purchase this phone for their use. 
T
Other features that the phone offers are almost similar with the rest. It has 
a 5-inch display that is becoming the accepted benchmark for smartphones these 
days. The screen itself supports 10-point multitouch so you are ensured that your 
experience using the phone will be good – regardless where you touch on the 
screen. 
At 160 grams, it is the heaviest among the entrants in this showdown – 
and we wish that Samsung could have slimmed it down a bit more so it can be 
lighter in the hands. The processor on the Samsung Galaxy J2 Prime is a quad-
core processor form MediaTek, running at 1.4Ghz. It is more that enough to power 
your apps, listen to music and take photos. 
Talking about taking photos, the Samsung galaxy J2 Prime features an 
8-megapixel rear camera, that is paired to a f/2.2 lens that helps in low-light 
imaging situations. The low megapixel count makes the J2 Prime trailing in the 
rear for image quality but if you are only looking to take a quick snap for simple 
social media sharing – it just covers the basic. 
Other notable features include dual SIM standby, with one of the SIM tray 
doubling as the memory slot for a microSD slot – if one needs to expand the 
internal 8GB storage. On the selfie front – the J2 Prime comes with a 5-megapixel 
camera sensor that includes both a fast f/2.2 lens as well as a front LED flash as 
well to brighten up your selfie game. So go ahead and take your selfie in a dark 
place – the wide aperture lens and the LED flash will give you more backup for 
great selfies with your friends or loved ones.
Using the J2 Prime is like any other Samsung – the TouchWiz interface 
overlaying Android 6.0 Marshmallow is simple to use and looks great on the 
screen. Samsung did say that the phone will be getting Android 7.0 Nougat at 
the time of printing, so the phone is futureproof for buyers who are purchasing 
them today.

Dell Inspiron 15 
Gaming Laptop
lthough Dell already has Alienware for its gaming laptops, its Inspiron 
Gaming series is also a surprisingly great gaming laptop to have 
without the high cost that comes with owning an Alienware. While the 
Inspiron Gaming series isn’t nearly as popular or as renowned as the 
Alienware, it has built a steadily following over the years with its consistent and 
reliable usage for gamers without having to break the bank.
A
Design
The no-nonsense overall design of the Inspiron 15 Gaming laptop will surely have 
you thanking your lucky stars you went for something a lot more inconspicuous. 
Unlike many other gaming laptops where its over-the-top design would surely 
turn heads from fellow gamers, on-lookers and potential thieves, the Inspiron 15 
Gaming looks like your everyday, run-of-the-mill laptop with so much more under 
the hood.
Performance
If you’re into graphic-heavy games, might I suggest you keep the visual settings 
to a minimum to avoid any frame rate drops and screen stutter as it will incur. 
Sadly, as good as the Inspiron 15 Gaming is with casual MOBA games, it doesn’t 
work that well with AAA games. However, even after reducing my video settings 
on Skyrim and Diablo III, it still plays well and I even get close to 90 FPS on both 
games.
Daily Usage
I much prefer using the Inspiron 15 Gaming for both work and play. Seeing as 
I’m more of a Dota 2 and Overwatch player who works way too much and barely 
has any sleep, this laptop is perfect for that. Not only is the 15.6-inch Full HD 
display screen great for gaming, it’s also great for watching movies and doing 
work simultaneously (although I can’t promise you will get any work done if you 
binge-watch like me).
Price
The Dell Inspiron 15 Gaming is modestly priced, only RM4,599, which is a big 
difference compared to the GT62VR by a few thousand Ringgit. While most 
premium gaming laptops prices are close to the down-payment of a Perodua 
Myvi, Dell keeps its Inspiron 15 Gaming series relatively affordable, making it 
accessible to all the casual PC gamers out there who couldn’t be bothered to be 
part of the ever-elite ‘PC Master Race’.

known as Acer Predator has also been causing waves in the gaming 
laptop scene with its obscenely huge gaming laptops paired with its exorbitant 
prices. We have one such laptop with us today – the Acer Predator 17x.
A
Design
Right off the bat, the Predator 17x sure as heck looks bigger than it is; it also 
weighs a ton so you can forget about heading to the gym. A few daily reps with 
this behemoth and you’re good to go. I also enjoyed the fact that it comes with 
front-facing speakers, giving you greater depth in terms of audio quality and 
performance. 
Performance
By far one of the best gaming laptops I’ve ever played on. From the benchmark 
scores alone, you can tell the 17x is worth its weight in gold. For those who know 
me (and there are very few to begin with), I loathe gaming laptop keyboards. 
However, I would make an exception for the 17x. Not only is it highly responsive, 
it feels great typing on it and that is a big plus for me. I definitely had a ball of 
a time gaming on the 17x, whether its Dota 2, Overwatch and even Skyrim. The 
details in the game were amazing and that’s only with the GTX 980M; imagine if 
it were with the GTX 10 Series.
Daily Usage
I am a sucker for HD movies (explains why I would pay extra in my Netflix account 
just so I can get HD streaming capabilities). It’s 17.3-inch Full HD display screen is 
as glorious as it is magnificent. Watching movies or even trying to get work done 
was an almost impossible task because I’d much prefer to just stare blankly at the 
screen. One feature I love about the 17x is being able to disable the touchpad on 
command with a button located right next to it.
Price
The part you have all been waiting for. This baby is going for a whopping 
RM12,999, which is essentially a down-payment to the new Honda City 1.5L V! 
I can’t imagine anyone willing to fork out that much money for a gaming laptop 
when you could use it for a car but, who am I to judge… With that said, if your 
budget isn’t an issue, I would highly recommend the 17x.

Wiko ufeel Go
or something a bit different, we present to you the Wiko ufeel Go. The 
smaller of the two latest phones from Wiko represents a nice smartphone 
that anyone can jump onto if they are looking to invest in their first 
smartphone. Not only the price point for this model is attractive, it has 
features and even looks like it is taken from a high-end smartphone model. 
F
Underneath the seemingly metal body is the MediaTek MT6735 processor, 
which is a quad-core chip making it a good fit for most apps on the Google Play 
Store. You do get only 2GB of RAM, but to some it is more than enough if they do 
not open too many apps at the same time. 
You get a 5-inch screen that is a 720p panel – which is decent enough for 
usage by most users out there. It is not a full HD screen, but on the upside, it 
gives the phone better battery life thanks to the lower resolution that it needs to 
draw on screen. 
It is also one of the heaviest in the bunch at 172 grams and even then it 
comes with a party trick – you can remove the whole back of the phone. This is a 
feat seeing that the phone’s back is made from metal. Underneath the removable 
back is a non-removable battery, as well as the slots for two SIM cards as well 
as a microSD card. 
MediaTek supplied the MT6735 processor for the phone, which consists of 
four Cortex A53 cores. The chip also gives the phone LTE capabilities that is useful 
when you are on the go. Not only that, there is a 4000mAh battery powering 
everything so you are sure to enjoy a whole day of using the phone while you are 
out and about. 
Imaging with the Wiko is also good, thanks to the 13-megapixel camera at 
the back of the phone. It can also take full HD video, but no 4K footage. For selfies, 
the 5-megapixel shooter serves the purpose to capture you and your friends when 
you are out and about in the city. 
Surprisingly the Wiko ufeel Go feels very substantial in the hand as the curve 
and design of the phone is very conducive in give the most comfortable handhold. 
There are no sharp edges on the phone, and the 2.5D glass looks like it is taken 
straight from a high-end device. Plus, the Wiko even comes with a fingerprint 
scanner, making it one of the few mid-tier smartphones to feature it at its price 
point.

Xiaomi Redmi 3S
f you are ok with a name that is always associated with China, check out 
the Xiaomi Redmi 3S. This phone is the company’s current small offering, 
but don’t let the small size fool you. The Xiaomi Redmi 3S looks smart, has 
high-end features and can last for a long time on a single charge – which 
what users want to see in a smartphone these days.
I
With a 5-inch display, it is par for the course for the Redmi 3S when compared 
with the other phones in the line-up. The screen is thankfully a 720p variant, so 
the resolution of content on screen will still be generally legible. While it is no 
high-resolution screen, the screen gives a balance between quality and battery 
life as the phone will not draw too much power thanks to the lower resolution 
screen. 
Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 430 beats in the heart of the phone. It is one of the 
few phones at this price point that is pushing its 64bit processing capabilities, 
so it has a bit of a leg up when you need to use an app in a higher bit mode. At 
144 grams, the Xiaomi Redmi 3S is quite light in the hand, and the all metal build 
makes it feel like it is a higher tier phone rather than the mid-tier phone it is. 
Imaging with the Xiaomi Redmi 3S is generally a good one thanks to the 
13-megapixel camera at the back that also features Phase Detect Auto Focus 
(PDAF) system, which promises a better autofocus lock when used. In practise, it 
is quite remarkable that the images that it takes are of very acceptable quality, 
although it is not the best that we have seen so far. The f/2.0 lens helps in low 
light situations as well. 
The Redmi 3S comes with a dual-SIM solution, which gives the phone the 
ability to tap into two different lines at the same time. It also accepts external 
additional storage through the microSD slot, but this will take up one of the two 
SIM slots in the hybrid dual SIM tray that Xiaomi elected to use with this phone. 
Security is paramount these days for smartphone users – this is why the 
fingerprint scanner that is on the Xiaomi Redmi 3S is fast and accurate. This will 
give users a piece of mind over their sensitive information on their smartphone. 
Plus, you can also add layers of security with smart features like App lock, Hidden 
folders and Hidden notes that is tied to a fingerprint scan.

Lenovo IdeaPad 
Y700
nother household name when it comes to consumer-friendly laptops 
and PCs, Lenovo was never known for being a capable brand in the 
eyes of gamers. Sure, you could play certain casual games on them 
while keeping the video settings average at best but if you wanted the 
best out of your games, you would’ve looked somewhere else. Lenovo is hoping to 
change that perception with the Lenovo IdeaPad Y700, which comes with gaming 
capabilities.
A
Design
Much like the Inspiron 15 Gaming, the IdeaPad Y700 has a no-nonsense look 
about it while remaining discreet about being a laptop capable of gaming. Not 
only is it lightweight, but it also doesn’t take up much space on your desk as it 
doesn’t come with a numpad. The hinges on the Y700 are also smaller, giving it a 
different look compared to many other conventional laptops. Located beside the 
hinges are JBL speakers, making everything you hear in much better quality than 
expected.
Performance
In terms of performance, the Y700 also shares plenty of similar specs as the 
Inspiron 15 Gaming. However, after pitting both gaming laptops through the 
benchmark tests, the Y700 trumps the Inspiron 15 Gaming easily and convincingly. 
Even gaming on the Y700 feels much better than the Inspiron 15 Gaming; I didn’t 
have to reduce my visual settings to its essentials and could afford to go to town 
with it knowing the Y700 could take the heat.
Daily Usage
I don’t know if this has happened to you but one thing I didn’t like about the 
Y700 was its trackpad. I could never detect the mouse cursor until I plugged in 
an external mouse. Although a lot of people out there would prefer a mouse with 
them always, the trackpad is also an essential key for plenty of other people 
who’d much rather prefer using the laptop in bed or when there’s limited space 
for a mouse to move around. Aside from that, the Y700 handles just fine when it 
comes to watching movies and getting work done.
Price
Sharing a similar price point with the Inspiron 15 Gaming, it’s almost safe to say 
that either of the two laptops would be great for casual gamers who are looking 
for a laptop they can bring with them where ever they go while still being able to 
game comfortably. Unlike the other laptops in this month’s showdown (which can 
make one cry with just its price alone), the Y700 is retailing at RM4,299, which is 
a very modest price for what it holds beneath.

Illegear 
S5
have been a huge fan of Illegear gaming laptops ever since I first got my 
hands on the D7X a couple of months back; I have not looked back since. 
Being homegrown and the first of its kind to develop customisable gaming 
laptops, Illegear has a strong fan base from local Malaysians who are 
looking for a gaming laptop that is unique. The Illegear S5 is no different.
I
Design
Illegear’s main selling point is they bespoke gaming laptops, making them 
fully customisable and giving you complete control over the different kinds of 
components you can put in it. Visually, you can also customise the colour of the 
laptop to go with a custom artwork as well as signature so you know for sure it’ll 
remain an original. However, the stock build of the Illegear S5 is also great with 
its sleek, brushed metal look and feel, giving it a great look without taking up 
much weight.
Performance
Based on the benchmark scores alone, the S5 smoked every laptop to come 
through for this Showdown. You may think that it’s only just on paper but the S5 
performs just as well as it does through benchmarks. Running it through all my 
games, I am thoroughly convinced this is a gaming laptop I want in my life. Not 
only were my games lag and stutter free, I could even have them running at ultra-
settings and still game with extreme ease.
Daily Usage
If you chose to splurge on the 15.6-inch 4K resolution with QFHD and an anti-
glare display, you will not be disappointed. Not only does it heighten your gaming 
experience to new levels, it will also ruin any cinema experience you have here on 
out. Running on the latest Kabylake processor, the S5 enhances 4K video playback 
as well as 3D video performance so you can even game in 3D as well as watching 
3D movies.
Price
Illegear is the first of its kind to introduce this feature – users can choose what 
goes into the laptop to better suit their needs. Starting at the basic price of 
RM6,899, the price of the S5 can be brought up to a staggering RM22,894 if 
you’ve chosen to go down the path of the highest specs (that is if you have that 
sort of money just laying around!). This could almost pay off a Proton Saga!

Honor 5A
he Honor brand has a good amount of following in Malaysia, so it is 
no surprise that they are actively pushing their branding through their 
smartphone here in Malaysia. One of the segments they are strong is the 
mid-tier market, and their offerings for this market is almost second to 
none. The Honor 5A is their model in this every growing market, and what it brings 
to the table is something interesting to all parties to consider. 
T
At 5.5-inch, the Honor 5A has the largest screen among the contenders here, 
but it shares the 720p resolution with many of its competitors in the market. 
While this is an IPS display, the larger screen does mean that the screen clarity is 
not as sharp as a phone with a smaller display. However, Honor has managed to 
create a balance between quality and sharpness for day-to-day use. 
Huawei has elected to fit the Honor 5A with its own silicon. The Kirin 620 
from HiSIlicon is an eight-core SoC, built with 64bit computing in mind. The SoC 
has a good power consumption rate that ensures the battery of the Honor 5A does 
not die too fast throughout the day. The battery at 3100mAh is not the largest in 
the line-up, but it can last for a whole working day with no problem at all, thanks 
to the Kirin processor. 
With 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage, the phone has enough memory to 
run all of your apps that you need. Of course, if you need to have more storage, 
the microSD slot can support up to 128GB for more space for your multimedia or 
apps, which the large screen is definitely suitable thanks to its large size. Plus, if 
you need to have two lines running at the same time, the dual SIM slots will give 
you the ability to plug in the lines that you need, which is especially convenient 
when travelling. 
Imaging with the Honor 5A is good, thanks to the 13-megapixel sensor on 
the back, and 8-megapixel sensor for selfie purposes. It is par for the course at 
least on paper, and the photos taken with the cameras are not too shabby either. 
The large size of the phone may turn off some users, but others may see the 
advantage of having a larger screen as well. Smaller hands may want to use this 
phone with two hands, but for the most part, the phone is comfortable to use in 
the hands. We wish the design is a bit less blocky though – more curves would 
be nice.

Lenovo A6600 Plus
ne of the biggest manufacturer of computer products in the world, 
Lenovo has fingers in just about every pie out there – from desktop 
workstations to portable machines for the office worker on the go. Their 
brand of smartphones are not too bad as well, with good performers in 
every level. The Lenovo A6600 Plus is one of the models we are quite happy with, 
thanks to its mix of performance, specs and looks. 
O
The front of the phone is a curious mix of both Lenovo as well as the company 
that they bought over – Motorola. There are hints of design here and there, the 
A6600 Plus is still a handsome phone to look at and to be seen with. Its 5-inch 
screen is similar to the other phones in the line-up, and feature the same 720p 
resolution as the other phones. More than decent for normal daily use we reckon. 
Running everything is the MediaTek MT6735p processor. This is a quad-core 
chip and is just enough for most apps to run with. It is not the fastest or the 
greatest chip in the bunch, but it does what it does without too much complaint. 
You will get 2GB of RAM with each A6600 Plus, and 16GB of on-board storage 
for your media files and apps. Par for the course really. Also, the phone features 
a microSD slot for times you need to expand your storage for more content to be 
displayed on your screen. Like the others here, the A6600 Plus also feature Dual 
SIM capabilities, so you can have two lines running at the same time. 
142 grams weight means that A6600 Plus will not stand out too much in this 
crowd, but the small 2300 mAh battery will. In the time where users routinely 
see 3000 mAh batteries as norm, the small battery capacity will be a sore point. 
Fortunately Lenovo has opted to have the phone feature removable batteries so 
that you can have a spare battery charged up to swap as the main one dies in the 
middle of the day. 
Using the phone is quite ok, as the mid-tier size means that the phone will 
not feel too off in the hands, and there are enough design elements that gives the 
phone a more handsome look and feel in the hands. It will not win any pageant, 
but it should work without too much fault on a daily basis.

After having way too much fun – and an unhealthy amount of sleep lost – with all these gaming laptops, coming to a decision was no easy task. In the end, after many 
more countless nights thinking which laptop won me over, I would have to say the Illegear S5. Its bespoke capabilities gave it an edge in the competition as you don’t have 
to settle for certain components that you don’t want or need. A special mention must be made to the Acer Predator 17x as it is a remarkable gaming laptop and I could see it 
becoming a competitor. Another notable mention goes to the MSI GT62VR Dominator Pro as MSI will always be a top contender when it comes to gaming laptops. If you’re 
looking for something a bit more affordable, might I suggest either Lenovo Y700.

The field of mid-tier smartphones is a big one, as while the flagships will rule the roost, it is the mid-tiers where all the pickings and peckings happen. Consumer who 
are not looking to spend thousands of ringgit in a smartphone will gravitate to the mid-tier market to fulfil their needs of a communications device that will not drain their 
wallet or their bank account. Because of that, the choice of which is the best model is a tough one to make, but after considerations and a discussion among peers, we 
have chosen the Xiaomi Redmi 3S as the winner of the showdown for the month. The main reason is that the model offers the best value for the buck, and at the same 
time gives the best performances for the price one pay for the phone. The rest were close, but this model edges the competition just that bit that it won the showdown in 
PC.com. If you need a second option, the Wiko ufeel Go is a great purchase as well, thanks to its combination of performance, price and looks.

Step 1: Find a puddle that captures beautiful 
reflections
Large puddles, which are easier to photograph reflections in, last for just a few 
hours after the rain. It is harder to capture clear and beautiful reflections when 
it is still raining, because the raindrops form ripples in the water. That’s why you 
should try to take photos soon after the rain stops. A particularly good time to 
do so is after a heavy downpour. Open spaces and vacant lots are good places 
for finding puddles. Without any large obstacles around, you will be able to see 
a wide variation of reflections in any direction.
Step 2: Lower your eye level and look for 
reflections
Everyone knows that puddles form when it rains, but few will notice how 
different the streets can look when reflected in a water puddle. That is because 
it is rather hard to spot such reflections from the high eye level of an adult. To 
have a glimpse of this magical world, you first need to lower your eye level. 
This is in accordance with the Law of Reflection, as illustrated below. Notice 
how only the sky is visible in the reflection when viewed from the eye level of 
an adult (B).
 
 
(1) Nothing but sky is reflected
 
 
(2) A large part of the building is captured
 
 
(3) Puddle
At the eye level of the average adult, nothing but sky is visible in the reflection 
of a puddle at your feet. Hence, if you want to capture the building, a good idea 
is to position your camera much lower (A).
There may also be times when it is important to get close to the ground to take 
your shots. For example, in the photo below, the camera was virtually in contact 
with the ground! This was to capture the lower part of the building.
EOS 5D Mark II/EF24-105mm f/4L USM/ f/5.6 / 1/1250sec / ISO 200
With the following 3 steps and more, you too can photograph reflections. These 
steps are not particularly hard, but there is a knack to mastering each one.

Composition Techniques for Wide-Angle Lenses
While wide-angle lenses are able to capture a wider range than standard lenses, they have the rather unique characteristic of perspective exaggeration that 
appears due to the special effect of convergence. In Part 1, I explained the different photographic effects of wide-angle lenses. Here in Part 2, I will help you get a 
better grasp of the characteristics of wide-angle lenses by showing you various photos that were taken in wide angle.

Step 3: Focus on the actual subject if you can’t 
establish focus on its reflection
Once you’ve found a puddle that can capture beautiful reflections, all you need 
to do is focus your camera as normal. However, if the puddle is shallow or if 
its surface is not still, your camera may end up focusing on the ground instead. 
Manually adjusting the focus is one way to fix it, but may be hard for beginners. At 
such times, think back to the Law of Reflection. As you can see from the drawing 
below, the subject and its reflection in the puddle are both roughly the same 
distance from the camera.
 
(1) Distance to actual building
 
(2) Distance to the building’s reflection
 
(3) When seen from perspective A, the building’s reflection appears   
 
to be deep inside the water.
Therefore, when you are unable to focus on a puddle reflection, try focusing on 
the actual subject, and then pointing your camera back toward the puddle with 
the focus locked (half-pressed). Because the distance from the camera to the 
actual subject is about the same as that to the apparent subject in the reflection, 
the puddle reflection should most likely be in focus. And just like that, you’ll be 
able to focus on a world that you may not have been able to see until now. Those 
of you who find it difficult to perform manual focusing should give this a try!

Have fun with strong perspective exaggeratioN
To enjoy the characteristics of wide-angle lenses to the fullest, try approaching 
your subject from the diagonal. By composing the subject such that it protrudes 
into the frame as you approach, it will appear to come from the edge of the 
image, creating a strongly exaggerated perspective.
A nightscape of a factory in Kawasaki city, taken with my wide-angle lens 
(FL: 23mm). I got right up close to the fence, which would normally be an 
irritating obstruction. The distance between my lens and the fence was almost 
zero in this photo. When up close like this, the intense perspective exaggeration 
of the fence has a strong impact, which might even be overpowering for the 
viewer. On the other hand, the factory in the distance, near the centre of the 
image, does not evoke as strong a sense of perspective exaggeration.
I took a shot of a plate of oysters at an oyster bar (FL: 16mm). Here too, I got 
right up close until my lens was just about touching the shells in the foreground. 
The exaggerated perspective is stretched across the plate from the foreground 
into the background.
Suggest expanse with exaggerated perspectives
Creating perspective exaggeration with a wide-angle lens evokes a sense of 
expansiveness in your photos. When you use a wide-angle lens in a scene of 
plants growing en masse, such as when taking photos of flowers, the resulting 
photos will evoke a greater sense of expansiveness than that which you can 
see with your own eyes.

In this example, the photo somehow gives the impression that it was taken in an entire 
field of flowers -  yet it was actually a cluster of small planters with a depth of around 
30 to 40cm inside a park. I took this shot right up close to the flowers with a focal 
length of 24mm.
Next, I also took this close-up shot of flowers using a wide-angle lens (FL: 
16mm). The perspective is thoroughly exaggerated from the foreground towards the 
background, giving the impression of an expansive garden of flowers.
Incidentally, the image here is of the same location seen from further back.
I actually took this shot using the same focal length of 16mm while standing 
up. However, the photo looks completely different. While the photo shows the 
overall appearance of the park, it is not clear what the subject of the shot is.

Tip 1: The ground is dark, so use negative 
compensation
The surface of the ground, whether it be asphalt, brick, or 
gravel, is generally a dark colour. When you take a shot as 
you would normally, the camera determines that the scene is 
dark, so it may capture images that are brighter than how the 
scene appears. To make your images appear as you see them, 
decrease the exposure compensation by around EV-1.
Tip 2: I recommend using maximum aperture
You may also want to try using your maximum aperture (lowest f-number) to take photos with a large bokeh effect. This is not limited to DSLRs and mirrorless 
cameras. Some compact cameras, especially the higher-end ones, can also produce lovely background bokeh! The camera will be in focus for the subject in the 
reflection, yet it will capture a magical looking reflection with the ground blurred out. This effect is clearly demonstrated in the example below.
Tip 3: Avoid photographing in crowded places 
Do be careful when photographing reflections close to the ground in a crowded area, 
especially when there are women wearing skirts nearby - you don’t want your intentions 
to be misunderstood for something much less innocent! In the first place, it is inadvisable 
to shoot in a location where you may be blocking the way of passers-by. In the first place, 
it is inadvisable to shoot in a location where you may be blocking the way of passers-by. 
Photographing reflections in water puddles is a great way to have fun after the rain. It can be 
a hassle to go out while it is raining, but once the rain stops, you can go about on your quest 
to find the doorway to a magical world in photos!
I focused on the reflection (a cherry tree overhead) in a drinking fountain. The 
surrounding area is blurred out, leaving the reflection in focus on the surface 
of the water.
When I took a normal shot of the water and its surroundings (the drinking 
fountain), the distance to the apparent subject was different, so the camera did 
not focus on the reflection.

I took this shot with the camera placed on the ground (FL: 16mm). This gives the 
floor an expansive appearance. However, when shooting in a low position, take 
careful note of your surroundings beforehand so as not to have your intentions 
misunderstood. Particularly for low position, low angle shooting around town, a 
good idea would be to make sure that no one is nearby.
Make legs look longer and better show off a subject’s figure
You can make the most of the extreme perspective exaggeration of wide-angle 
lenses to make people’s legs appear longer. For example, here is a low-angle 
shot looking up at a standing boy, with an exaggerated perspective in the 
upward direction from the feet at the bottom edge of the image. This makes his 
face appear smaller, thereby making the legs appear larger than they actually 
are.
In such cases, you should be careful not to place the face in the outer periphery 
of the image, as the face might become unnecessarily distorted. This is because 
perspective exaggeration is not as strong in the centre of the image.
This technique is used to better show off a subject’s figure and sense of style 
in portraits.
In this article, I introduced several characteristic photos taken using a wide-
angle lens. I’m sure that once you have mastered perspective exaggeration, 
you’ll have fun shooting with wide-angle lenses.
EOS 5D Mark III/ EF16-35mm f/2.8L USM/ f/4.0 / 1/40sec / ISO 800
Try using a low shooting position
It is interesting to use a low shooting position with wide-angle lenses that 
create strong exaggerated perspectives of subjects in the foreground. Taking 
shots from a low position means that you inevitably have to get close to the 
ground, and therefore can have fun with the expansiveness of the ground.

EOS 5D Mark III/ f/4.0 / 1/160sec / ISO 1250
Incidentally, low shooting angle and low shooting position are two very different 
things. Low angle refers to shots that are taken at an angle looking upward (as 
opposed to high angle), whereas low position simply refers to the camera being 
in a position lower than eye level. In the photo above, the camera is not only 
in a low position, but it is also pointing down towards the ground, making it a 
low-position, high-angle shot.

“Business Email 
Compromise (BEC) 
and Business Process 
Compromise (BPC) are 
sophisticated scams

regularly perform wire 
transfer payments.”
New Digital Threats 
Inbound for 217
Traditional vectors are supplemented by unorthodox method to tap into company information illegally
new wave of attacks focusing 
on businesses are set to 
rock the market in 2017. 
While traditional attacks 
on information and security is still 
prevalent – new vectors are increasingly 
becoming choice for unscrupulous 
parties to try and access important 
business information and data. 
Business Email Compromise (BEC) 
and Business Process Compromise 
(BPC) are sophisticated scams targeting 
businesses that regularly perform wire 
transfer payments and it will continue to 
grow as a cost-effective and relatively 
simple form of corporate extortion. 
A BEC attack operates by luring an 
innocent employee to transfer money 
to a criminal’s account. Another option 
is hacking directly into a financial 
transaction system, which requires 
more work, will result in far greater 
financial windfalls for criminals.
The Internet of Things (IoT) and 
Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) will 
also play a larger role in targeted 
attacks in 2017 as attackers become 
more interested in targeting connected 
devices to add botnets to carry out 
DDoS attacks. In the past year, IoT 
security has quickly escalated as a 
hot-button issue with multiple threats 
against the enterprise such as the Mirai 
botnet that took down Twitter, Amazon, 
and Netflix. IoT malware will open 
backdoors into the connected home that 
could go undetected for years.
“BEC attacks and ransomware 
have 
dominated 
the 
threat 
landscape so far in 2016, causing 
immense losses to businesses 
across industries and we continue to 
see cybercriminals adapting to the 
changing technology landscape,” 
said Goh Chee Hoh, Trend Micro 
Malaysia 
Managing 
Director. 
“While new ransomware saw an 
exceptional increase in 2016, that 
growth is no longer sustainable, 
so attackers will find new ways 
to use existing malware families. 
We foresee new attack methods 
threatening corporations, expanding 
ransomware tactics impacting more 
devices 
and 
cyber-propaganda 
swaying public opinion.”
The report states that while the 
ransomware numbers are plateauing 
– the range of products will expand as 
more IoT and non-desktop computing 
devices such as POS and ATMs are 
targeted. Vendors unfortunately are 
ill-equipped to secure those devices 
in time, especially older generation 
devices that has been on the market 
for quite some time. 
With 46 percent of the world’s 
population now connected to the 
internet, the rise in cyber-propaganda 
will continue as new world leaders 
are appointed, potentially influencing 
public 
opinion 
with 
inaccurate 
information in the form of fake news 
and alternative facts.

As seen in the Bangladesh Bank 
attack early in 2016, BPC attacks can 
allow cybercriminals to alter business 
processes and gain significant profits, 
and BEC attacks will continue to be useful 
to extort businesses via unsuspecting 
employees. More importantly, new 
targeted attack methods will focus on 
evading modern detection techniques 
to allow threat actors to target different 
organizations or even different levels of 
users in the same organization rather 
than a single point of entry. These threats 
means that companies worldwide need 
to be more vigilant in ensuring the 
security of their company is optimised 
lest they are breeched unknowingly by 
outside forces.

today announced that they 
are organizing the Hitachi 
Social Innovation Forum (HSIF) 
in Malaysia for the first time to 
showcase a plethora of cutting-
edge technologies, systems and 
applications that are ideal for 
Malaysia and to understand the local 
requirements and development.
Officiated by Dato’ Seri Ong Ka 
Chuan, Minister II of International 
Trade & Industry, the forum explores 
the current state of technology, 
witnessed 
by 
distinguished 
guests, industry experts as well as 
business leaders. 
According 
to 
the 
World 
Urbanization Prospects, 77.9% of 
Malaysians will be living in urban 
 Forum showcases new technologies for governments, businesses and the industry to adopt
Hitachi Social Innovation Forum 
held for the first time in Malaysia 
F
areas by 2020. The pressure such 
rapid urbanization bears on policy 
makers, authorities and society 
can be overwhelming especially on 
demands for power, transportation, 
security and overall management of 
cities. In this essence, developed 
countries are excellent case studies 
with 
their 
implementation 
of 
innovative solutions that address the 
challenges in a sustainable manner.
“In order to face the growing 
challenges of urbanization, the 
Government will continue with 
proactive measures to ensure the 
right infrastructure is in place. 
The Government is focused on 
developing the country to sustain 
population demands by working 
together with organisations on a 
mutually beneficial, public-private 
collaboration approach to bring forth 
advanced solutions to the public. 
Such strategic collaborations will 
propel Malaysia to greater heights 
via shared knowledge, resources 
and expertise,” said Dato’ Seri Ong 
Ka Chuan.
Participants viewed and learned 
first-hand 
on 
how 
future-ready 
integrated solutions and systems 
are deployed to create a smart, 
sustainable and secure society. Hitachi 
utilises its Area Energy Management 
System (AEMS) to gather and analyse 
information about the energy supply 
and demand in Japan’s Kashiwa-no-
ha smart city, and regulates the power 
grid accordingly. It is also collaborating 
with local Malaysia partners to 
implement energy solutions for current 
and future townships.
“Malaysia is at a very exciting 
crossroads 
where 
urbanization 
is taking place at a rapid pace. 
In recent years, we have seen 
tremendous emphasis on strategic 
urban planning in Malaysia to 
create liveable cities that are 
vibrant and can support local 
community 
and 
society 
well 
into the future. In this aspect, 
Hitachi can provide well-managed 
infrastructure and solutions for 
optimum efficiency and utilisation. 
We believe that Malaysia is indeed 
an ideal country in Southeast Asia 
for the adoption of innovative 
solutions, and this is why we are 
holding this forum in Malaysia,” 
said Shinichi Sakai, Managing 
Director of Hitachi Asia (Malaysia) 
Sdn. Bhd.

this 
year’s Fuji Xerox Innovation 
Showcase, Fuji Xeox Asia 
Pacific launches its new line 
of innovative document manage 
solutions, powered by the new 
Smart Work Gateway Concept. This 
new concept by Fuji Xerox supports 
diverse 
workstyles 
to 
enable 
business persons to perform their 
utmost capability by collaborating 
with cloud service partners while 
also offering various communication 
tools tailored to suit individual needs 
and preferences.
Through the Smart Work Gateway 
concept, Fuji Xerox is also introducing 
 Fuji Xerox comes out with 14 multifunction devices known as the new Smart Work 
Gateway concept
Work Faster and 
Smarter
I
14 models of cloud-friendly, digital 
colour multifunction devices under 
its ApeosPort-VI C / DocuCentre-
VI series. This new series creates 
a 
communication 
environment 
that improves productivity in the 
workplace by integrating the Cloud 
Service Hub – a new platform that 
links the multifunction devices with 
multiple de facto standard cloud 
services. You can now log into the 
cloud services through a single sign-
on, which then allows you to scan or 
save the documents from the cloud. 
The documents can also be cross-
searched across the cloud services 
linked to the Cloud Service Hub, 
thus contributing to the business 
process improvement.
What makes all of this possible 
is through the Fuji Xerox Direct 
Management Console, a free software 
that displays the contents of the Fuji 
Xerox Direct – a portal that provides 
Fuji Xerox’s various Internet services 
– on client PCs. Through the software, 
you can now purchase, download and 
install apps for multifunction devices 
from the Internet in a centralised 
manner. With the Fuji Xerox Direct 
Management Console being used from 
a PC, multiple multifunction devices 
can be simultaneously managed and 
configured, providing rapid adaptation 
in the event of sudden changes in 
working processes.
“The Smart Work Gateway was 
developed in response to the rapidly 
growing demands of our customers 
– 
demands 
that 
conventional 
multifunction 
devices 
alone 
are 
unable to meet,” said Masashi Honda, 
President and Chief Executive Officer, 
Fuji Xerox Asia Pacific. “Based on this 
concept, Fuji Xerox underscores its role 
in accelerating business efficiencies. 
We will continue to expand the 
ecosystem 
through 
collaborations 
with more partners, enhancing the 
role of a multifunction device into a 
communications portal.”

EasyParcel And Bison Partner To Meet 
Demand In E Commerce Logistics 
Simplifying delivery for online retailers and customers
ison 
and 
EasyParcel 
today announced their 
partnership in PGEON – a 
service that  facilitates 
the last-mile delivery leg to all 
users of postal services.
PGEON is a new service offered 
by EasyParcel, whereby postal 
users can have the options of 
dropping-off or collecting their 
parcels from myNEWS.com outlets 
throughout Malaysia. As more 
and more customers favour online 
shopping, delivery expectations 
have also changed. This puts 
pressure on e-retailers to minimize 
fulfilment cost and complexity 
while maximizing fulfilment speed.
Clarence 
Leong, 
co-founder 
and 
Chief 
Executive 
Officer 
of EasyParcel said that they 
decided to initiate the partnership 
with myNEWS.com to fill in the 
B
as 
organisations 
embrace 
modern technologies to meet the 
expectations of an increasingly 
digital society. With more than 20 
years of experience in the ICT sector, 
Kai Peng held key roles in three 
multinational companies including 
Compaq 
Computer 
Corporation, 
Digital Equipment Corporation and 
Hewlett-Packard. 
“I 
appreciate 
Red 
Hat’s 
determination to provide the best 
products and solutions to our 
customers in the industry. I am 
excited to work alongside the 
demand. “Logistics has a huge part 
to play in eCommerce. It could be 
the defining factor for success of 
eCommerce companies in retaining 
their customers.” 
“We want to enable the mailing 
of their parcels with minimum 
stress nor worries, allowing more 
flexibility for consumers to manage 
their deliveries. More often than 
not, consumers are not home while 
the delivery is being delivered.” 
says Leong.
PGEON provides a win-win 
platform to both courier companies 
and postal services users. As 
courier companies no longer have to 
send staff to visit individual doors 
for parcel collection or delivery, this 
also means customers’ privacy can 
be protected as well. 
Bison is the parent company 
of many press and convenience 
retail stores and is responsible 
for all 320 myNEWS.com outlets 
nationwide. Bison is looking at 
opening 70 outlets in Malaysia by 
the end of its 2017 financial year. 
With more outlets, PGEON service 
can reach out to more parts of the 
country, giving more drop-off or pick-
up point to consumers.
Dang Tai Luk, Executive Director 
cum Chief Executive Officer of 
Bison shares, “We are constantly 
looking at ways to upgrade and 
diversify our services to benefit our 
customers. Parcels pick-up and drop-
off service will be a great addition 
to our outlets as the eCommerce 
industry is growing in Malaysia.“ 
Malaysian Red Hat team and our 
local partners to help customers 
modernise their IT infrastructures 
whilst 
enabling 
an 
innovative 
approach which can enable to 
business success,” said Kai Peng.

Digital data management key in advancing 
digital economies within ASEAN
Pro-growth digital data management policy important in developing the regional economic vision
new report titled ‘The 
Digital 
Economy 
and 
the Free Flow of Data: 
Advancing 
the 
ASEAN 
Economic Community’ was presented 
in collaboration by the US-ASEAN 
Business Council and Delloitte to 
the Malaysian government and 
the local business community. The 
reports highlights steps that can be 
taken by ASEAN member states to 
advance their digital economies and 
the ASEAN Economic Community 
through pro-growth data digital 
management policies. 
Speaking 
at 
the 
event, 
Ambassador 
Michael 
Michalak, 
Seniro Vice President and Regional 
Managing Director of the US-ASEAN 
Business Council said,” The digital 
economy plays a strategic role as 
a critical enabler for deepening 
ASEAN regional integration and as 
well as helping drive next generation 
domestic demand led growth for 
startups and SME's.”
“Regional integration and the digital 
economy are both big opportunities in 
what is one of the world’s fastest growing 
regions. All manner of business, from the 
start-up to the regional champion as 
well as the multinational, will benefit 
if the AEC framework puts the digital 
economy front & center. Now is the 
time to do so,” Jeff Pirie, AEC Leader, 
Deloitte Southeast Asia, added later.
The US- ASEAN Business Council 
and Deloitte forum was hosted at 
Microsoft’s office, and included a 
panel discussion on Malaysia’s digital 
A
economy and how the findings of the 
report can best be applied to support 
growth and innovation in Malaysia. 
The report was developed by the

 IT Decentralization gaining traction for 
digital business innovation in Malaysia
VMware introduces Evolved Cloud Strategy to address the matter to the local market 
uided with insight from the 
“VMware State of the Cloud 
2016” 
research 
report, 
VMware highlighted that 
IT departments are being sidestepped 
by business leaders who adopt their 
own cloud-based technologies to 
innovate faster and meet growth 
objectives. VMware shared that one 
of the most significant impediments 
to digital business innovation in 
Malaysia is the decentralization 
of IT and its detrimental effect on 
enterprise operations.
VMware’s State of the Cloud 
2016 research found that enterprises 
in Malaysia face high levels of IT 
decentralization, with more than 85 per 
cent of local respondents – one of the 
highest in the Asia Pacific and Japan 
region – agreeing that the purchasing 
and management of IT are taking place 
outside of IT’s purview.
“As Malaysian companies race to 
compete in the global digital economy, 
the research findings validate what 
we’ve been hearing from our customers 
across the region – most organizations 
have a hybrid cloud environment, with 
workloads and applications across 
different platforms. The challenge 
for local CIOs is to continue enabling 
their companies to innovate and meet 
growth objectives, and yet effectively 
manage and secure applications 
dispersed 
across 
multiple 
cloud 
environments. VMware Cross-Cloud 
Architecture responds directly to 
this challenge by offering cloud 
freedom and control,” said Alex 
Loh, country manager, Malaysia and 
Brunei, VMware.
To help businesses, VMware 
has 
extended 
the 
company’s 
hybrid cloud strategy with the 
VMware Cross-Cloud Architecture, 
enabling 
customers 
to 
run, 
manage, connect, and secure their 
applications across clouds and 
devices in a common operating 
environment. In addition, VMware 
Cloud Foundation offers a new “as-
a-service” option that delivers the 
full power of the software-defined 
data center (SDDC) in a hybrid

PC.com: Congratulations on Canon Malaysia’s 
celebrating 30th Anniversary, how has the 
journey been for Canon? Any milestone you 
would like to share? And what can consumers 
expect on your special achievement for 2017?
Andrew Koh: Canon Marketing Malaysia was 
established in 1987 in Kuala Lumpur. We are a brand 
that is synonymous with many market firsts such as the 
first ever plain paper fax and color copier in Malaysia, 
the first ever colour fax machine in Malaysia, the 
launch of the highly popular Bubble Jet printer as well 
as the world’s smallest and slimmest DVD camcorder 
in 2006. For the past 30 years, we have grown in 
leaps and bounds in terms of innovation in imaging 
technology as well as expansion of the business 
through providing total imaging solutions from input to 
output. Today, we are a major player and leader within 
the imaging solutions industry, and we couldn’t have 
done it without our customers, loyal fans and business 
partners. So we would like to thank them for being on 
this journey with us.
One of the most significant and meaningful 
milestone for Canon Marketing Malaysia is our 
position as the Number 1 inkjet printer brand in 
Malaysia for 21 consecutive years, and we have just 
celebrated 2 consecutive years as the Number 1 laser 
printer brand in the market. 
For our 30th Anniversary this year, we have kick-
started the celebrations with a week-long product 
exhibition and showcase at Mid Valley Megamall 
in February. We shall be hosting many more events 
and activities to commemorate our third decade 
in Malaysia. We shall keep you and the readers in 
suspense for now, but do follow our social media 
channels for the latest updates.
PC.com: Since being on board what is your 
assessment on the printing and photography 
market segment in Malaysia?
Koh: The photography industry in Malaysia has 
undergone a shift. Many consumers now have the 
convenience of taking photos with their smartphones. 
As they are more exposed to better photo image 
qualities, consumers who become more savvy 
in photo-taking have started looking for better 
alternatives. Therefore, the camera market is still 
sustainable and we encourage consumers to invest in 
a good camera to take photos during their travels and 
important occasions. 
As for the printing industry, it has also evolved. 
Where in the past, printers were used mainly to 
print documents in office or education environments, 
printers are now being embraced as a tool to enable 
creativity, especially by families with children, 
entrepreneurs and the creative community. We have 
continuously encouraged the photo-printing culture so 
that the memories taken by your camera or smartphone 
can be printed out and enjoyed in print format. With 
our latest PIXMA inkjet printers which are equipped 
with advanced wireless connectivity features such as 
Wi-Fi and NFC (Near Field Communications), it makes 
printing a breeze at just the tap of a button.
PC.com: How do you view Canon’s position in 
Malaysia? Do you feel the need to revitalise the 
brand and how do you plan to do this?
Koh: Canon is an industry leader in both the photography 
and printing markets. As a total imaging solutions 
provider, we will further strengthen and reinforce our 
position as the trusted brand that Malaysians can have 
confidence in. We are constantly improving on the latest 
technologies and innovations through our focus on R&D, 
which we invest 8% of our global turnover in annually. 
As such, Canon’s products continue to be technologically 
up-to-date, attractive and user-friendly. 
In line with Canon’s corporate philosophy of 
‘Kyosei’ which is defined as ‘living and working 
together for the common good’, we are continuously 
contributing to society and protecting the environment 
through our many CSR projects.
We believe that Canon’s product quality and brand 
values will enable us to stand out in the market and 
get us closer to the hearts, and at the top of the minds, 
of consumers. 
PC.com: In the consumer segment you have 
mirrorless, printers and DSLR, would any each 
play a prominent role for Canon this year? And 
why?
Canon has been known in the market to produce 
reliable, durable and affordable products. We 
acknowledge the growing number of competition 
from printing brands and their competitiveness in 
the market and we are ever-prepared to maintain our 
position as the number one printer brand in Malaysia.
We are definitely committed to the mirrorless 
camera market for both body and lens development. 
We have a head-start especially in terms of lenses as 
our mirrorless cameras are able to take advantage of 
our wide array of DSLR lenses with just an adapter. 
We are targeting to double our market share for 
mirrorless camera segment in Malaysia. Nonetheless, 
the focus on mirrorless will not hinder our efforts 
to grow more opportunities in DSLRs or compact 
cameras. Our plans include the strategic use of digital 
media to educate and encourage users to discover 
their passion in photography. Photo enthusiasts who 
progress in their own hobby will one day require that 
extra edge and decide to switch up to a DSLR. 
Globally, Canon has maintained its No.1 market 
leadership for 13 consecutive years (2003 – 2015) for 
its interchangeable-lens digital cameras and compact-
system cameras.  Whilst locally, the EOS 5D-series 
has gained in popularity and acceptance since 2005 
and has always been one of the much-anticipated 
models amongst avid photographers until today.
 
PC.com: You’ve been with Canon for 20 years, 
what kept you with the company? What are our 
observation with talents these days and what is 
Canons position in retaining employees? 
Koh: I have a great passion for the Canon business. 
I have been fortunate that I had a chance to work 
in different countries, firstly Singapore, India and 
now Malaysia. I have also had the opportunity to 
manage different teams and products, so I am given 
new challenges all the time. I enjoy tackling different 
challenges and I am constantly breaking out of the 
old comfort zone and embracing the new trends. I see 
myself as being adaptable to changes and having the 
capacity to look at things from a global perspective. 
As a global company, Canon recognises the talents 
within each organisation and believes in exposing its 
staff to more opportunities. We give them the chance 
to prove themselves within the company and encourage 
them to go even further, by working in a different country 
and a different culture. This helps them to develop an 
international outlook on their career.
PC.com: Lastly, you’ve won the Most Influential 
Person in Photography could you share on what 
was that all about? 
Koh: The award was the 3rd “Most Influential Person 
in Photography” (ranked among 10 personalities) by 
“Asian Photography” magazine for 3 consecutive years 
from in 2013 to 2015. Our team was really passionate 
about promoting the photography culture and 
together, we succeeded in growing the DSLR market 
and expanding Canon India’s retail footprint through 
exclusive Canon Image Square stores from 100 to over 
200 stores. It is an honour for me to receive the award 
and for our team’s efforts to be recognised.

017 is kicking into full gear 
and with the new year, 
comes the introduction of 
new inspiration and technologies 
set to revolutionise the way we 
live, work and play. Design is 
always evolving and here are 
some upcoming design trends for 
businesses to keep an eye on in 
2017, in order to create the best 
experiences for your customers.
These are some of the new 
design trends that are set to make 
the world a little bit more fun, and 
functional at the same time.

design approach featuring 
clean, open space and crisp 
edges) is an ongoing trend

Design Trends for 
Your Business 2017
Companies should follow these new design trends 
for their artwork and deliverables in the year ahead
with 
design 
companies– 
and monoline illustrations 
are a clear progression for 
2017. Monoline’s style is 
approachable and appealing 
as it seeks to simplify complex 
ideas with quirky illustrations. 
Brands such as Samsung are 
already capitalizing on the 
trend, and more are sure to 
follow in 2017.
• Long-Form Ads (that tell a 
story) - In an age of 10 second 
videos and 15 second ad 
spots, long-form advertising 
that have long been avoided 
to 
cater 
to 
consumer’s 
reducing attention span, can 
ironically offer a breath of 
fresh air when done right. 
How? Create an ad that tells a 
story. Everyone loves a story. 
A holiday ad recently directed 
by Wes Anderson for H&M 
is a great example. Aside 
from wearing clothes from 
the fashion brand, there is 
virtually no mention of H&M. 
Instead viewers are swept 
up in the story of train riders 
delayed by a snowstorm on 
their way home for Christmas. 
It’s the story, the experience 
that 
will 
capture 
your 
audience’s heart.
• Virtual 
and 
Augmented 
Reality 
- 
Innovative 
technology is putting virtual 
and augmented reality front 
and centre. The technology 
is young, but there is growing 
demand for content even as 
VR headsets are still being 
adopted. The content AR/
VR provides is immersive, 
creating 
a 
whole 
new 
spectrum of experiences for 
consumers, and along with it, 
new challenges that creators 
can no longer ignore.
• Aerial Views - The velocity 
of growth for online video 
is staggering, and with that 
growth comes a desire for 
new perspectives. Drones

PC.com: Where did the idea of the Acer Swift 
7 come about? Not more than a few months 
earlier did HP launch its Spectre and ASUS 
with its Zenbook 3. Was the Swift 7 meant 
to level the playing field in terms of an ultra-
portable laptop while still meeting the ever-
increasing lightweight design and portability?
Seet: As a company, we are pursuing our effort to 
transform into a hardware, software and services 
company. Acer is constantly innovating and we 
have always been at the forefront and technology 
and development, being the first to market in 
several products that challenge the industry on 
what technology can achieve for customers. From 
the world’s first ultrabook, the Aspire S3 launched 
in 2011 to the recently-introduced Predator 21 
X, the world’s first curved screen notebook, Acer 
leads the way in design, productivity and power in 
devices.
We are focused on building innovative, premium 
products, and over the years, our product range 
has continuously become more stylish while 
retaining all its performance. This includes the 
ultra-portable, elegant Swift 7. What we offer is 
high-quality products with meaningful innovations 
and real value. The Swift 7 is the most innovative 
ultra-slim laptop we have ever developed with its 
outstanding portability, elegant design, and superb 
performance. It shows our investment, commitment 
as well as capability in research and development 
in producing the best products for our customers.
Acer is one of the early adopters of the 7th Gen 
Intel Core processors for our ultra-slim Swift series, 
again demonstrating that we are in the forefront 
of providing cutting-edge technology for our users. 
We believe that by designing products that meet 
the real needs of people, it proves and supports 
our ambition to deliver technology into the hands 
of many.
Besides being the world’s first laptop to be 
under 1cm thin, the Swift 7 is the also the perfect 
complement to any lifestyle with its sturdy build and 
excellent battery life of up to nine hours - ensuring 
that users gain more productivity from this laptop 
without having to lug the charger and cables around!
PC.com: Aside from the Swift 3 coming out 
with a brand new colour, can you tell us about 
the Swift 3 that makes it different from its 
predecessor?
Seet: The Acer Swift 3 was introduced in 
October last year in its Sparkly Silver colour whilst 
the new colour unveiled in November was the 
Luxury Gold. The elegant Luxury Gold colour adds 
a touch of luxe to this irresistible laptop which 
is ideal for modern working professionals and 
students who seek a stylish productivity device to 
complement their personality.
Powered by 7th Gen Intel Core i5 processor, 
the Swift 3 features Acer Fingerprint Reader that 
is paired with Windows Hello to offer an efficient, 
convenient and secure way to access user’s 
Windows account. Also, it comes with 2x2 MU-
MIMO 802.11ac technology and fast 256GB SSD, 
the Swift 3 offers 4GB of memory and up to 10 
hours of battery life, delivering solid results in a 
small package. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. 
We believe both colours will have their own groups 
of fans.
PC.com: The whole idea of 360-degree hinges 
have been around for quite some time like the 
Lenovo Yoga 900S and the HP Spectre x360 
for example. What makes the Acer Spin 5 
different from the rest? 
Seet: The 360-degree hinge is not a new technology 
to Acer, as we already have the convertible Aspire 
R14 which was launched early last year. The Aspire 
R14 can be transformed into four different modes 
for a variety of needs, making it easier and more 
convenient to use and perform at work or play.
No doubt, the hinge technology has become 
more advanced over time. The whole idea is about 
the usability of the device. The Spin 5 features 
Acer’s patented 360-degree dual-torque hinge, 
providing wobble-free touch experience and high 
level of convenience via its easy convertibility to 
the four useful modes; as a laptop or tablet, in a 
space-saving display mode, or in tent mode with 
great viewing angles for sharing presentations or 
watching movies. The flexible and sturdy hinge also 
makes it easy to open but prevents toppling over 
when using the 13.3-inch Full HD IPS touchscreen 
display. The convertible Spin 5 is offering ultimate 
flexibility to allow users to use it per their 
requirements, while maximizing productivity.
Apart from the hinge technology, the Spin 5 is 
powered by 7th Gen Intel ® Core™ i3, 4GB DDR4 
memory and up to 128GB of SSD storage for best-in- 
class performance and fast computing experience. 
Furthermore, no charging is needed when you are 
out all-day for work or play with up to 10 hours of 
battery life.
PC.com: The Acer Predator Z35 monitor is 
relatively larger (35-inches total) compared 
to the 27-inch for the Z1. What would you say 
differentiates the Z1 from the Z35?
Seet: Predator Z1 is the first 27-inch, curved monitor 
with NVIDIA ® G-SYNC ™ technology. What makes 
this monitor even more interesting is its Tobii eye-
tracking technology, which allows new interactions 
like aiming, identifying enemies and taking cover 
simply by looking at objects on the screen. With 
this cutting-edge technology, gamers will be able 
to interact with the characters more realistically 
and enjoy a much more immersive and seamless 
gaming experience. Their eyes and intuition will be 
their greatest weapon now.
On the other hand, the Predator Z35 is a 35-inch 
21:9 UltraWide Full HD (2560x1080) curved gaming 
monitor with a curvature of 2000R featuring NVIDIA 
G-SYNC for immersive, dynamic and wrap-around 
gaming experience. It supports overclocking to a 
lightning-fast mode of up to 200Hz refresh rate. 
Size does matter. It depends on the users on what 
do they want to use their laptop for. At the end, 
everything goes down to the reason they acquire 
the devices.
PC.com: In terms of the AIO Acer C Aspire 22, 
will there be any significant upgrades brought 
to it in the near future?
Seet: Not at the moment.
PC.com: Is there anything we can expect from 
Acer in 2017?
Seet: At this point, I can only say: please wait 
for our announcement. One thing for sure is that 
Acer will always be moving forward to offer our 
innovative products which will never fail to excite 
the users.

of smartphone users is set to raise the 
demand for online shopping platforms 
and experiences in the months ahead.
Online shopping today is largely 
driven by price and convenience 
– a good deal on products that 
are delivered quickly. By 2026, 
these 
fundamental 
desires 
will 
still exist, but expectations of the 
shopping experience would have 
changed 
drastically. 
Millennials 
and Generation Z consumers, for 
example, will be demanding more 
from eCommerce providers, such as 
the ability to discover in real-time 
unique goods they will not find in big-
box retail chains.
Undeniably, with the rise of 
eCommerce – in Malaysia and globally, 
the retail sector is becoming more 
competitive. For online and offline 
retail businesses to stay relevant 10 
years from now and beyond, here are 
two key developments that must be 
considered:
The Term ‘Online Pure-Play’ Will Be 
Eradicated By 2026
For many customers, one initial trial 
is both required and sufficient to build 
the trust necessary to make future 
purchases without having to physically 
see and feel each new product. As 
such, while new entrants to retail will 
no doubt start from an online pure-
play perspective, they will inevitably 
move to test out physical retail 
space with pop-ups, complemented 
by collections or showcase stores to 
facilitate product discovery and trial. 
ZALORA is a prominent example of 
an eCommerce brand in Asia that has 
already done this. 
Once they turn into established 
brands with a significant consumer 
following, pure-play online retailers 
must further develop their physical 
presence, to enhance fulfilment and 
customer service. For most, this will 
take the form of partnerships along 
the lines that are emerging today, 
such as the ‘click-and-collect’ model. 
Retailers in Malaysia can perhaps 
draw inspiration from the UK – 
where brands like ASOS and Boots, 
and eBay and Argos, have started 
collaborating and implementing click-
and-collect models. Another example 
is MatahariMall.com in indonesia, 
which has combined its online

presence with designated counters 
within its existing physical malls 
and hyper-marts to enable click-
and-collect.
By 2026, physical retailers will 
continue to reduce the amount of 
physical space they hold, switching 
their investment emphases online. 
Online retailers, on the other hand, 
will invest further in establishing 
physical presences. As such, the term 
‘pure-play’ will be rendered obsolete.
Becoming Mobile-First is Key to 
Creating Shopping Experiences of 
the Future
in the retail and commerce domain, 
mobile will soon become the dominant 
channel for loyalty programmes and 
rewards, due to its ability to provide 
levels of interactivity and engagement 
that traditional programmes cannot 
match. in technologically advanced 
markets like Hong Kong, Singapore 
and Taiwan, mobile advertising is 
already firmly in the advertising 
mix and will become the dominant 
(but not exclusive) channel for most 
brands by 2026. 
with more than 44 billion mobile 
users, digital advertising and content 
is emerging as a key customer 
engagement channel for retailers 
in Malaysia. in 2016, Malaysian 
businesses invested a total of RM 
1.37 billion in digital advertising. As 
businesses start to derive more value 
and even more consumers come 
online, annual investment in digital 
engagement is expected to exceed 
RM 2 billion by 2020. 
As a natural extension of mobile 
becoming mainstream, ‘contextual 
location’ will become an integral 
part of the retail experience. The 
ability to identify a user’s location and 
deliver targeted, timely and relevant 
information and messages to his or 
her mobile device is a powerful and 
compelling proposition. Moreover, the 
real-time aspect of location analytics 
will offer a more adaptive approach 
to marketing, enabling retailers in 
Malaysia to adapt their engagement 
tactics in real-time to meet an 
individual consumer’s needs. 
One example is the use of 
Bluetooth Low energy (BLe) beacons. 
BLe beacons are tiny units with 
built-in sensors that can broadcast 
signals to BLe-enabled and mobile 
devices within range, triggering 
corresponding beacon applications 
on the device and allowing retailers 
to engage their customers after they 
have left their physical stores. 
in this instance, if an individual 
in Kuala Lumpur’s Low Yat Plaza 
has stood in an aisle looking at 
smart Tvs for more than 15 minutes 
but leaves a store within the mall 
without buying one, location-based 
technology will suggest that interest 
is there even though it has not led 
to a purchase. A retailer in the mall 
who has implemented this technology 
can then follow up by sending 
personalised recommendations and 
promotions related to the product to 
the customer’s smartphone. These 
serve as reminders and incentives for 
the customer to purchase from that 
retailer, rather than its competitors.
Today, most mobile advertising 
happens on the mobile web 
because it is convenient and 
scalable. However, with consumers 
increasingly engaging with digital 
content and services anytime and 
anywhere on mobile devices via 
native applications, retailers must 
become familiar with application-
based and cross-device advertising 
and messaging. Retailers who can 
integrate the mobile web, apps, 
in-app targeting and contextual 
location into today’s business 
operations 
and 
engagement 
strategies will set the stage for 
the seamless adoption of newer 
mobile technologies or add-ons 
when required.
A decade from now, instant 
gratification will mean something 
more sophisticated than just a 
quick fix. it will have evolved 
into expectations of a seamless 
shopping 
experience 
across 
a 
range of connected devices, in 
which immediacy, convenience and 
personalisation 
are 
paramount. 
Consumers 
will 
expect 
goods 
advertised online to live up to the 
promise in every way – with no 
disconnect between the “fit and 
feel” of what they see and what they 
get. This places immediate pressure 
on retailers to evolve in the way 
they operate and engage consumers. 
Those that fail to meet expectations 
will soon fall by the wayside.

I 
love anything that has a horror element to it. Give me a B-rated 
horror movie and I will still watch it, no matter how bad it is. 
Horror games however, are another thing entirely. At least in 
movies, I get to watch in the comfort of my own room without 
having to worry about Pennywise The Clown or Freddy coming to 
get me. But if it’s a horror game, the demons, ghouls and whatnot 
are coming for me, technically. In Subterrain, the horror element 
isn’t the usual jump scare from horror movies, but the fact that you 
are alone in this game; and isn’t that what everyone is afraid of… 
being alone (well, at least I am).

he Realism Is Real
You start off as Doctor West, a former 
doctor who was tried on murder for 
a failed experiment and ended up in 
MPO, a prison located on an underground 
city in Mars. The opening credits shows 
West retelling the story of how he wound up 
on prison and what happens soon after. You 
are then immediately thrown into the game 
with no clue as to what to do except for pop-
up tutorials that will randomly appear from 
time-to-time, giving you an idea of how to 
go about the game.
The game throws you into it at a bird’s-
eye view style of gameplay, giving you a 
much larger area of vision. However, you 
will have to control your character with both 
analog buttons as the left analog controls 
your movements while the right analog 
controls your sight so it’s best to be sure 
you’re looking at the right area. Subterrain 
also applies a Sims-like element to the game 
where you must keep an eye out on your 
character’s stats like Thirst, Hunger, Sleeping 
and Pissing. Much like a real life human 
being, you will have to drink water from time 
to time, eat, sleep and of course take a leak.
This makes the game mighty complex, 
especially if you’re just looking to power 
run through the entire thing. You will also 
have to beware of contaminations, bleeding, 
fractures, exhaustion and hypothermia. 
Unlike other survival games, Subterrain 
keeps it to its grassroots by making me be on 
edge the entire time trying to find a freaking 
bathroom so West can stop complaining 
about how much he has to pee (a word of 
advice: as much as West says he’s thirsty, I 
advise against drinking tap water as there is 
a chance of contamination and what would 
you know, that’s how I started the game).
Survival Of The Fittest
As mentioned earlier, you will have to 
constantly keep an eye out on your vitals 
as it is a crucial element of the game. 
Another element Subterrain introduced is 
its survival element where you will have to 
examine every possible object in the room 
that can be examined. From there, you 
must scavenge for parts relating to certain 
quests or even perform research on the 
items you’ve scavenged to come out up with 
remedies and cures to aid in your survival.

fter almost a year after Gravity Rush came 
onto the big stage, Gravity Rush 2 is here and 
it’s bigger and better than the last. Admittedly, 
I am going into Gravity Rush 2 blind as I never got a 
chance to experience how great the first instalment 
was (I don’t get paid enough to buy all the games I 
want to continue with the storyline). However, due 
to the overwhelming reception Gravity Rush received 
at the beginning of last year, I had a certain level of 
expectations with Gravity Rush 2.

AWESOME
But Subterrain doesn’t just throw you into 
the wilderness without any preparation; you 
have West for help seeing as he’s already a 
doctor (but a miserable one seeing as that 
landed him in jail).
You must also be sure that you have enough 
oxygen to sustain through the levels seeing 
as you are on Mars after all. If not, you will 
suffocate, and die, which is what happened to 
me a couple of times. To stay alive, you will 
have to restore habitability into the areas by 
repairing temperature and oxygen generators, 
otherwise you’ll just be another piece of meat 
floating around mars. 
One thing I did hate about Subterrain was 
its travel time in-between locations via the 
tram. Although it does come with normal and 
fast travel speed, I stuck with normal travel 
speed during the initial stages because I didn’t 
think it would take that long. Little did I know, 
when the game said “1 hour and 48 minutes”, 
they weren’t lying. I could’ve gone to the 
bathroom, made a sandwich, have a smoke, 
taken a nap and still have time leftover to wait 
for me to reach the destination.
Keep Everything
Scavenging is an important element in 
Subterrain; be sure to pick up every item 
you come across, even if all signs point to 
you not keeping it in your inventory. From 
weapons to food, water and even scrapes 
of paper and broken knick-knacks will come 
in handy. You will also come across a wide 
variety of weapons, which will help you do 
battle against the fiends who are in your 
way. From shotguns to even crafting your 
own damn lightsabre (I smell a lawsuit 
from LucasArts coming), you will be able 
to upgrade and customise your weapons 
to make the combat system a little more 
bearable.
Final Thoughts
Subterrain is an open-world concept game, 
which to a certain extent, gives you complete 
control over your movements, objectives and 
even the pace of the game. Instead of having 
to follow a particular order, the decision is 
up to you on where your next destination 
lies within the game. Want to scavenge 
everything to build the perfect lightsabre? 
Go for it! What I loved about Subterrain was 
that every level was an original with no two 
places sharing similar designs. All in all, if 
you’re into horror/survival/suspense games, 
Subterrain is a good choice to go with.

Believe I Can Fly
Well, you’re not technically flying but if you’re 
able to bend the laws of physics and gravity 
– pun intended – into your favour, you will 
be able to. Although I don’t advise you trying it in 
real life, you’re more than welcome to test out the 
gravity-controlling mechanics, which is great and 
super easy to get accustomed to, making me feel 
like an air bender on steroids (minus the ability 
to control the air around you). You will be able to 
choose between three different gravity-defying 
styles that will revolve around your playstyle.
Aside from the original gravity style featured 
in the first game, Gravity Rush 2 includes two new 
styles to further diversify one’s playstyle. Lunar 
allows you to be lighter while increasing your speed 
and ability to jump higher. Jupiter on the other hand, 
makes you heavier but gives your attack moves 
greater damage output and impact. What makes 
Gravity Rush 2 great is the ability to switch styles 
with the touch pad, making it that much easier to 
be switch up the gravity styles when you choose.
Seeing as I was a complete noob – and proud 
– when it comes to Gravity Rush 2, there is a bit of 
a learning curve when it comes to getting around 
using the winds and gravity to your favour. A piece 
of advice I can give to new players for Gravity Rush 
2 is to spend a couple of minutes to wander around 
the aerial city of Hekseville by just jumping – 
literally – at any opportunity to familiarise yourself 
with the controls.
A Whole New World
After going through hours of gameplay walkthrough 
footage for Gravity Rush and diving straight into 
Gravity Rush 2, it’s very easy to tell the difference 
between the two. First off, Gravity Rush 2 has a 
much larger open-world to explore as compared to 
its predecessor. Although the game does pick up 
where Gravity Rush ended, the art direction and 
style was improved tremendously, making the first 
instalment look cheap and boring. What I enjoyed 
most about the graphics was its comical, yet 
somewhat heavily focused on the vibrant colours of 
the environment, looking a lot like what Borderlands 
would do. However, for someone who isn’t used to 
being surrounded by vibrant and vivid colours, it 
could get a bit uncomfortable after a while as the 
camera controls in Gravity Rush 2 is mediocre at 
best. The best way to counter this is to constantly 
have your thumb over the right analog stick so you 
can click it to recentre the camera in case you get a 
bit too discombobulated.
A great thing about open-world concepts in 
RPGs is the ability to explore to your heart’s content 
without having to continue the storyline until you 
see fit; one of the many reasons why I adore RPGs 
the most, I can do whatever I want and whenever 
I want to do it. Another reason is because I do not 
possess the same amount of free time as I once did

GREAT
where I know look back and think, ‘what in the hell 
was I thinking?!’ I digress, back to Gravity Rush 2.
From floating cities to airships, the world – 
also known as Jirga Para Lhao – is your oyster 
to explore. Be sure to make the most out of your 
exploration time as you will undoubtedly come 
across upgradable gems. What I would encourage 
you to do is jump over the edge in first-person mode 
as it was the closest I could get to skydiving without 
having to leave my own home (for all lazy adrenaline 
junkies, this one’s for you).
Recovering the Continuities
I am not a huge fan of anime so asking me to watch 
the anime to fully understand the background of the 
story sounds like lazy craftsmanship. What could 
have been included into the game was left out and 
made into a show so the publishers could milk out 
every cent from poor plebs like me (admittedly, I 
was a bit too invested into the Kingsglaive movie as 
well as the animated series, Brotherhood).
Gravity Rush: the Animation – Overture is a 
17-minute short that helps confused gamers to tie 
the original PS Vita game along with the sequel into 
one convoluted storyline. If you happen to be the 
sort of person who has to get the story straight from 
the get-go, I recommend you give the two-episode 
short a watch as it does pretty well in tying the story 
together.
Worse Than Klingon
I’ll probably piss off some Trekkies reading this 
but I’ve always wanted to tango with the Devil 
anyway. The story of Gravity Rush 2 is told through 
a fictional language so it’s best to be prepared for 
plenty subtitle reading. The language in its own is 
highly intolerable to my ears; and here I thought 
Klingon was bad enough. What happened to the 
good ol’ days where fictional languages have a nice, 
velvety sound to it, like Elvish? Most of the entire 
narrative is told through in-game conversations so 
be sure you’re on your toes to read the subtitles. If 
not, you could miss out on a key piece of information 
to further the storyline.
Aside from the main storyline, Gravity Rush 2 
does provide some pretty interesting side quests, 
albeit somewhat similar to what Final Fantasy XV 
had to offer (fetch your own damn jewels Dino 
you smug looking son of a B!). The side quests in 
Gravity Rush 2 vary between borderline interesting 
and fun to just being absurdly weird like staging an 
alcoholic’s intervention.
At The End Of It All
When it comes right down to it, aside from 
its glaringly annoying narrative and constant 
subtitle-reading, Gravity Rush 2 is a pretty 
interesting game with a far greater gameplay 
than it gives itself credit for. If you’re one for 
RPGs, this is the game for you without any 
restrictions whatsoever when it comes to 
exploring the open-world.

Collect Everything and Anything
The main objective of Ben 10: Up To Speed is using 
ben to run through the jungle collecting coins and 
boosters. At the end of every run, you will also 
receive item drops which can be opened to gain 
extra goodies. Along the way, you will meet alien 
robots who are out to stop you seeing as you have 
the Omnitrix. What makes this game different 
compared to the latter mentioned above earlier is 
its straightforward approach without any added 
fluff. By collecting the coins and power-ups, you 
can then choose to upgrade the Omnitrix while 
unlocking the rest of the other aliens.
Dream Partially Fulfilled
Ever since I was a kid, I would always look 
forward to the Ben 10 TV series while secretly 
hoping I would find an Omnitrix and can turn into 
10 different aliens. As I grew older, I realised all 
those aliens are already part of me, hence why I 
can so easily alienate myself from everyone else. 
From Four Arms to Hellblast and even XLR8, you 
can use any of the 10 aliens in your arsenal to take 
on the bad guys as you run through the same damn 
map over and over and over again.
There will also be certain situations along the 
run where you will need specific aliens to cross 
through a section of the map but the game makes 
it easy enough for you to switch to the right alien 
without any trouble. As a 25 year old, this game is 
too easy sometimes. Then I realised – I am a 25 
year old and I am playing a game made for kids 
(what am I doing with my life).
Great For Kids
If you have kids below the age of 12 and they 
are constantly on the prowl for your smartphone, 
this game is worth downloading just to appease 
their youthful energy and outbursts. Personally, 
I enjoyed the game for the first 15 minutes as it 
brought back plenty of memories back when I was 
younger and times were simpler; the worst that 
could happen was not getting your homework 
done and even then, you weren’t that terrified.
With that said, get this game for your kids and 
not yourself. You’re a grown adult, I’m sure you 
can put your time into greater things. However, I 
am still very much a child so I’m the exception (I 
kid, of course).

Sara Is Missing (SIM) provides a refreshing 
take on the horror genre in video games through 
an simulation game setting where everything is 
being played through the eyes of another device. 
Basically, your phone has become Sara’s phone 
the moment you launch the game, which is a great 
take on the modern-day horrors of how connected 
we are to our phones.
Not Your Everyday Horror
SIM is not your typical horror video game with 
jump scares or anything remotely horrifying. On 
the contrary, the game talks about the horrors of 
mobile technology and how it can easily dictate 
our lives and with every decision we make. I 
applaud Monsoon Labs for the way it handled 
modern-day voyeurism through the content you 
can find in the phone. I would also like to point 
out a throw-away character in the game who goes 
by ‘Buddy’. Why Sara would choose to be friends 
with a sleaze like that is beyond me (although I 
could see myself using his pickup lines in the near 
future when my love life goes up in flames).
The game starts you off with Iris, the 
phone’s very own personal AI assistant (which 
is essentially Siri spelled backwards). Iris is a 
compelling character as it will be your only option 
for advice and help as you go about the game. 
What makes Iris creepy is its Jarvis-like style of 
talking, very much like a human.
Iris will tell you that Sara is missing – yeah, 
no shit Sherlock – and it is your job to find her; 
you literally have no say in the matter and that is 
where the fun starts. After a brief conversation 
with Iris, I gained access to Sara’s home page 
where you can creep on her personal messages, 
emails and notes. Her gallery, unfortunately, 
would be corrupted until you discover the right 
clues to Iris (and here I was thinking Monsoon 
Labs would’ve gone the full nine yards with nude 
selfies or whatnot). After scrolling her messages, I 
only have two questions for the developers – who 
are the actresses who play Faith and Aya and how 
do I get to know them?
I kid of course.
The Horrors Within
Throughout the course of the game, you would have 
to skim through every single message log Sara has 
with her friends, her mother and even her asshole 
ex-boyfriend (who sounds like he has the best damn 
job in the world photographing nude models). Once 
you discover a clue, simply tap and hold on the 
screen and if it’s the right clue, Iris will appear to 
help you progress with the game.
As mentioned earlier about the idea of voyeurism, 
SIM focuses on a lot of sexual topics in the game, 
mainly one of which is a clue that James will send 
you in the later portion of the game. The clue in 
question talks about a satanic calendar who have 
a thing for orgies, anal sex and human sacrifice 
(because all go very well together don’t they).
One of the things I didn’t like about the game 
was its highly anti-climactic ending, which makes 
you choose between two characters with a short 
time limit. However, there was a subtle nod to 
there being more to the game in a later episode so 
perhaps there will be more to the story in the future.
A Lovable Brain Teaser
I love a good puzzle game and in that aspect, 
Monsoon Labs have captured it perfectly with just a 
hint of horror added with a splash of insanity. More 
so, Buddy is hilarious and I do hope he comes back 
in the later episodes with more ridiculous ways of 
trying to send girls dick pics or even putting worn 
out and sleazy pickup lines to work. 
Are you f#$%ing kidding me Buddy
How are you still friends with him, Sara

What A Classic
Wonder Boy Returns keep the original 
game mechanics from its arcade 
counterpart, which features its side-
scrolling running mechanic. You will 
gain control of Boy and run through 
multiple courses, collecting food 
along the way and defeating monsters 
while still trying to rescue Tina, said 
girl who was kidnapped. Wonder Boy 
Returns brings back nostalgia for many 
gamers who grew up with the game as 
Sega has kept it to its almost-original 
concept, but with a far more advanced 
graphic style.
Old School Is Back
2016 saw its fair share of 
remastered video game classics 
and 
it 
doesn’t 
look 
to 
be 
stopping anytime soon. Wonder 
Boy Returns is no different as 
you will still be in control of 
Wonder Boy as you run through 
prehistoric courses, flinging axes 
whenever you can while gliding 
through with a skateboard in tow 
(how a skateboard appears in a 
prehistoric universe is beyond 
me). The remastered version does 
come with its own perks as well 
like new bosses and new courses 
to run through that even old school 
gamers will enjoy. One feature that 
has been added in is being able to 
play as the original 1986 Wonder 
Boy in full pixelated gloriousness! 
There are also additional power-
ups to pick up as you side-scroll 
across and even encounter new 
enemies. CFK have done a good 
job in keeping Wonder Boy Returns 
nostalgic to old school gamers but 
interesting enough for new school 
players.
Cop or Drop
If you grew up with arcades and 
miss the simplicity of them with 
added difficulty levels that can’t 
be found in today’s games, Wonder 
Boy Returns is a must-have. It 
will definitely bring you back to 
the glory days of retro gaming. 
Although not as difficult as it once 
was, it still poses a challenge to 
players who aren’t familiar with 
the game mechanics as that is also 
different as well. And we all know 
how humanity lives on challenges 
(personally, I would just delete the 
game and loathe myself for getting 
it in the first place but that’s just 
me).

Keeping It Classy
Keeping in touch with the classic 
Super Mario Bros. running game, 
Super Mario Run is a side-
scrolling, 
auto-running 
mobile 
game, much like its predecessor. 
You keep control of Mario as you 
run from left to right while hopping 
over obstacles and trying to collect 
gold coins. Super Mario Run comes 
with another game mode called 
‘Toad Rally’ where you will race 
against the ghost of other players 
to beat their time, like how the 
Super Mario Kart series worked.
The other game mode is 
called 
‘Mushroom 
Kingdom’ 
where you can customise your 
very own kingdom with the coins 
you collected through the main 
gameplay. The more coins you 
collect, the more customisation 
you can do to the castle.
Pay To Play
Although Super Mario Run does come 
free-to-play, if you want access to the 
entire game, it does come with a one-
time payment of $USD9.99. Considering 
the depreciating value of our local 
currency compared to US Dollars, it 
would be safe to say that not everyone 
would be willing to pay to play a mobile 
game that is priced at RM39.90 (well, I 
was hesitant on it; I can do much more 
with that sort of money).

Nostalgia
For fans who grew up with the 
franchise, Super Mario Run is a 
great throwback to the series. 
Much like how I was with Final 
Fantasy XV (I’m a huge geek 
towards the series, sue me), Super 
Mario run is definitely worth its 
weight in gold just to get the sense 
of nostalgia.

Dubbed as the most basic 
form of its gaming laptop lineup, 
the Q5 Evo will be equipped with 
the Intel Core i5-7300HQ CPU and 
NVIDIA GTX 1050 4GB DDR5 GPU 
by default. Gamers can also look to 
upgrade the CPU to the Intel Core 
i7-7700HQ and to the GTX 1050Ti.
Thanks to the introduction of

settings at ultra.
The Q5 Evo comes at a starting 
price of RM3,999 and is fitted with 
a premium Full HD IPS display and 
a fully programmable RGB backlit 
keyboard. It also comes with 2x 
M.2 PCle SSD slots and 5x USB

MOVE OVER TITAN X
 The GeForce GTX 1080Ti is here
VIDIA has been riding on 
an all-time high ever since 
the introduction of its 
latest Pascal architecture-
based GPUs have broken benchmark 
records and retail stores worldwide. 
Now, NVIDIA is looking to break the 
mould once again with the unveiling 
of the GeForce GTX 1080Ti, a beast 
compared to both the GTX 1080 and 
GTX Titan X.
The GTX 1080Ti is kitted with 
11GB of next-generation GDDR5X 
memory and includes 3,584 NVIDIA 
CUDA cores, which boasts a frame 
buffer running at a whopping 11GB/

was designed for deep learning and 
artificial intelligence.
The craftsmanship of the GTX 
1080Ti comes with superior heat 
dissipation from a new high-airflow 
thermal solution with vapor chamber 
cooling. The power architecture 
also features a seven-phase power 
design 
with 
14 
high-efficiency 
dualFETs.

(WG.U) and Fnatic.
The first day of the tournament 
already saw an upset for the local 
favourites as they lost their respective 
matches and dropped down to the 
lower bracket while eventual grand 
finalists DC and Newbee were off to a 
strong start in their opening matches. 
DC in particular had a tougher road 
compared to their opponents as they 
had a TI6 grand final replay against 
Wings Gaming. History did not end up 
repeating itself as DC walked away, 
winning two games in a best-of-three 
series. In the end, Newbee from 
Group and DC from Group B made its 
way to the semifinals.
Day 2 wasn’t any better as it 
saw the elimination of the local 
favourites as well as crowd favourite 
Team NP (vastly due to its captain, 
EnternalEnvy) and XctN. This was 
largely due to their losses against 
VP and Wings Gaming, which saw 
them make up the other half of the 
semifinal bracket. The final day of ESL 
One Genting saw nail biting matches 
between DC and VP as well as an all-
Chinese semifinal, Newbee vs Wings 
Gaming. Although DC did comfortably 
win the series 2 – 0, Newbee took 
down Wings Gaming 2 – 1, ensuring 
there wouldn’t be a repeat of the TI6 
grand final.
The grand final was a back-and-
forth best-of-five series, which saw 
Wings Gaming take the lead after 
a confident and comfortable win 
against DC. Unfazed, DC came into 
the second game with guns blazing 
and after almost an hour in game 
time, managed to level the scoring 
to 1 – 1. Game three saw Newbee 
pulling ahead once again after some 
beautiful teamwork and exceptional 
individual gameplay from the boys 
from China. Similar to game three, 
game four saw another game ending 
just before the half hour mark but this 
time in DC’s favour as they went for a 
similar hero composition that worked 
out for them against VP in day two. 
This shattered Newbee’s confidence 
as DC went on to steamroll the 
Chinese powerhouse in game five, 
forcing out the ‘GG’ call from Newbee 
just after the half hour mark.

Samsung unveils its first curved gaming monitor, utilising it’s very own 
Quantum Dot technology
eeping up with the momentum 
of 2017, Samsung brings 
forth its first ever curved 
gaming monitor that features 
quantum dot technology, the CFG70 
gaming monitor in 24- and 27-inch 
models. With Samsung’s Quantum Dot 
technology, gamers can experience an 
improved delivery of a highly impactful 
and immersive visual experience, which 
is also accompanied by 1ms moving 
picture response time (MPRT), reducing 
display transitions between moving and 
animated objects.
The CFG70 comes with a “Super 
Arena” design that features an industry-
best 1,800R curvature with a 178-degree 
ultra-wide viewing angle, matching the 
natural curvature of the human eye. It 
can also express brilliant and accurate 
colours across a 125% sRGB spectrum 
while being able to produce a 3,000:1 
contrast ratio. This amplifies previously-
hidden gaming details in both light and 
dark settings. The CFG70 also leverages 
integrated AMD FreeSync Technology 
K
over HDMI functionality to synchronise 
with the screen’s impressively high 
144Hz refresh rate with users’ AMD 
graphics cards.
From 27 January onwards, the 
Samsung CFG70 gaming monitor will 
be available for offline purchase at 
selected retail outlets at RM1,699 (24-
inch) and RM2,099 (27-inch). Keeping 
in touch with its partnership with 
Lazada, the CFG70 gaming monitor 
will also be available on Lazada from 
19 to 26 January and the first 100 
customers will walk away with a free 
gift worth RM264.
“Our Quantum Dot display gaming 
monitor creates an unprecedented 
visual experience that no gamer 
has ever experienced. Optimised 
on breking boundaties and bringing 
lifelike picture quality, the CFG70 is 
an incredible leverage for gamers to 
have especially when competing in the 
growing popularity of eSports,” said 
Lee Sang Hoon, President of Samsung 
Malaysia Electronics.

THE PS4 FAMILY RECEIVES MAJOR 
UPGRADES
The PS4 Pro will receive ‘Boost Mode’ while the PS4 will be able to support 
external hard drives
or all current PS4 gamers 
who are suffering with the 
measly 500GB/1TB internal 
storage support (I know I am), you 
can now put your worries to rest as 
PlayStation will be introducing an 
upgrade where all current PS4’s will 
be able to support external hard 
drives up to 8TB. Another feature 
that has long been asked for by the 
PS4 community is the ability to use 
in-game screenshots as desktop 
wallpapers and Sony will be giving 
us just that.
Sony will also be tidying up the 
PS4 quick menu screen so you will 
now be able to create and join parties 
without having to revert back to the 
main desktop screen. Other new 
features that Sony will be rolling 
F
out includes 3D Blu-Ray support 
for PlayStation VR as well as the 
ability to post status updates in your 
PlayStation Network feed.
For PS4 Pro users, Sony will be 
rolling out a beta preview of its latest 
firmware, version 4.50. This new 
version will allow PS4 Pro users to 
run PS4 games on the latest firmware 
even if the game hasn’t been 
optimised to do so by the developers. 
Dubbed as ‘Boost Mode’, this latest 
update will allow you to run older PS4 
game titles on the PS4 Pro with better 
GPU and CPU clock speed.
This will be a great update for 
current PS4 Pro owners who are 
looking to make the most out of 
their upgrade from the regular PS4 
to the Pro. 

Gatebox acts as your home’s gatekeeper and, 
well, keeper.
ometimes you just need someone to wait for you at home. If 
you are attached it is not too bad – but if you are still single, 
you may just go back to a cold house at the end of the day. 
Until now. 
A Japanese company called Vinclu (“a company that makes 
crazy things and supports crazy people”) is now taking pre-orders 
from Japan and the United States for a new interactive, artificial-
intelligence driven home automation system. Called Gatebox, the 
new Internet-of-Things product takes Amazon’s Alexa, Google Home, 
Spike Jonze’s film Her, and the “holographic” anime characters of 
Vocaloid concerts to their unified natural conclusion.
It is connected to the internet, and users can literally talk to the 
Gatebox and have things automatically turn on – lights and heater 
for example. The avatar can even make conversations with you once 
you are connected to it via the app. 
It may sound lonesome – but this could be the perfect partner for 
unattached people out there.
