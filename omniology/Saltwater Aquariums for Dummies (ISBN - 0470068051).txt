About the Author
Dr. Gregory Skomal is an accomplished marine biologist, underwater
explorer, photographer, aquarist, and author. He has been a fisheries biologist
with the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries since 1987 and currently
heads up the Massachusetts Shark Research Program. Greg holds a master’s
degree in marine biology from the University of Rhode Island and a PhD from
the Boston University Marine Program in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. His
research has spanned multiple fish habitats around the globe, taking him 
from the frigid waters of the Arctic Circle to coral reefs in the tropical Central
Pacific. He has written numerous scientific research papers and has appeared
in a number of film and television documentaries, including programs for the
National Geographic Channel, Discovery Channel, ESPN, and CBS.
Although his research passion for the last 23 years has been sharks, he has
been an avid aquarist for more than 30 years and has written nine books on
aquarium keeping. His home and laboratory are on the island of Martha’s
Vineyard off the coast of Massachusetts.


Dedication
Like the first edition of this book, this second edition is dedicated to those
people who helped me pursue an incredible career — namely, my parents,
siblings (Vickie, Bernie, Lenore, Burt, Maggie, and Paul) and several child-
hood friends. In their honor, I’ve made every tongue-in-cheek effort to incor-
porate them into the book as examples of how to do something and, in some
cases, how not to. You will also notice the names of my incredible niece and
nephews Nathan, Bernie, Ana, Clayton, and Gregory.
Since the first edition was published in 2002, life has dealt me great happi-
ness as well as profound loss. In early 2005, I lost a great friend, my father,
Bernard Skomal — a photographer, teacher, and mentor trapped in the body
of an insurance agent. The writing of this edition reminded me of how this
man gave me the guidance and tools to enjoy life and live it to the fullest. My
only consolation lies in the simple thought that he now inspires me with my
mother Irene once again by his side.
This book is also dedicated to my best friend and wife Kimberly, who pro-
vides me with unwavering support and limitless love despite my repeated
efforts to test them.
Author’s Acknowledgments
I want to thank the crew at Wiley for their continued faith in my work.
Specifically, Acquisitions Editor Tracy Boggier for making this second edition
come together, and Project Editor Corbin Collins for his patience, helpful
comments, and editorial insight.
It has been many years since my first aquarium, but my love and respect for
the marine environment and its inhabitants have only deepened. I cannot
impress upon the reader more our need to protect and conserve these 
valuable resources.

Introduction
G
reetings, my friend! You have just taken the first step into the world of
saltwater aquariums, and I welcome you. Stop looking for complicated
books with laborious equations on filtration and water chemistry. Don’t grab
a book just because it has a lot of pretty photos of elegant saltwater fish!
The complete hassle-free guide to setting up a saltwater aquarium is Saltwater
Aquariums For Dummies, 2nd Edition, and, fortunately for you, it’s in your
hands right now.
Saltwater Aquariums For Dummies, 2nd Edition is a fun reference book that
walks you through the entire aquarium process from selecting the proper
equipment to choosing the right fish. I even help you choose the right pet
store because, believe me, they are not all alike. I know, you’ve been told that
saltwater aquariums are complicated, need constant attention, and cost a lot.
But, my friend, times have changed since the introduction of the goldfish
bowl, and new technologies are making the saltwater aquarium hobby a fast-
growing pastime that, with a little diligence, can be mastered by everyone
with the average-size pocketbook.
That being said, relax and read on. I’ll keep it simple, but I won’t skimp on the
facts. If all goes as planned, your aquarium will be set up in no time, and both
you and your aquarium pals will be smiling for a long time to come.
About This Book
There’s something about fish that I find fascinating, and the thought of keep-
ing them in my home is very exciting. I am truly a fish fanatic. I find fish fun,
too, so I guess I’m really a fish “funatic” and hope you are as well. We are not
alone; people have been keeping fish in captivity for centuries. Among the first
fish kept in captivity were the common goldfish dating back to 265 A.D. in
China. Care and husbandry of fishes have come a long way over the centuries.
The world of fish is both enthralling and complex. This reference helps you
to understand this world by presenting what you need to know to set up
and maintain a successful saltwater aquarium. Doing so requires a general
knowledge of fish their anatomy, and biology. You also need a thorough
understanding of their proper care and husbandry.

In this book, I offer you a look at fish anatomy and show you what makes
these animals so unique. I also examine the aquarium and the importance of
meeting the biological needs of fish. In the process, I describe the critical dif-
ferences between freshwater and saltwater aquariums. I walk you through the
basics of aquarium setup and proper maintenance. I cover proper nutrition
and feeding as well as fish health issues. And I even cover some advanced
marine aquarium techniques. And, although I’m repeating myself, I present
all this info with a painless and simple approach.
Who I Am
I am a very avid fish enthusiast, but my passion does not only apply to fish.
In general, all creatures of the ocean, including the ocean itself, are my play-
ground and office. That’s right, I not only study the ocean in my spare time,
I do so when I go to work every day.
I have been fascinated by the ocean and its inhabitants since the days when
Jacques Cousteau was entertaining us with beautiful images of Earth’s inner
space, the underwater world. I watched every episode as a kid, and this
inspired me to set up an aquarium when I was less than a decade old. Oh, like
most, I started with a small freshwater system, which turned into a large fresh-
water system, which turned into a large saltwater system, which turned into
multiple saltwater systems, and so on. And believe it or not, most of what I
know about aquariums was self-taught through a lot of trial and error with
my buddies. As my aquariums became more elaborate, I learned slowly and
often at the expense of my mother’s pocketbook. Aquariums in those days
were expensive and cumbersome to set up. Filtration was primitive, and few
people made the bold move to salt water.
My passion for the ocean motivated me to become a marine biologist, and I’m
very fortunate to say that I am actually living my dream of traveling around
the world studying fish both in the wild and in the aquarium.
What I Assume about You
First, I expect that you know little to nothing about aquariums, filtration, fish,
or invertebrates. Second, I expect that you have no formal schooling in biol-
ogy. Lastly, I expect that you have a genuine interest in these subjects to the
point that you want keep saltwater creatures in captivity. That’s it! If you’ve
previously had a freshwater aquarium or you know a little more than I expect,
then feel free to skip over sections of this book or merely breeze through them
to make sure you have a firm handle on the subject.
2
Saltwater Aquariums For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Why a Dummies Book?
As I developed my skills as a young aquarist back in the dark ages (the 1970s),
I made every attempt to read the saltwater aquarium books that were published
in those days. A limited number of references were out there, and I tried to
read them as my aquarium buddies and I moved from freshwater to saltwater
systems. I recently unearthed one of those books from that box in the far
corner of my attic and I looked it over. Whoa! Even after taking and teaching
advanced college courses in biology, I found this antiquated relic a bit too
hard to digest. In fact, it would have been easier to eat than to understand.
Pages of equations on water chemistry, filtration, and aquarium maintenance
are not my idea of a hobby. And that’s why I wrote this book. Saltwater aquar-
ium keeping does not need to be complicated. We all need a book to keep it
simple, and that is exactly what this is.
However, I don’t want you to think that you will not encounter problems on
your journey through the aquarium hobby. The most advanced aquarists in
the world stumble from time to time on this road. But this book is your map
and companion, and if you follow its advice you will not only minimize these
problems, you will know how to deal with them. And if this book does not
answer your questions, then it will at the very least point you in the direction
of the answer, because no matter what other books may tell you, no single
book comprehensively covers it all. The world is full of literally hundreds
of aquarium books, both technical and practical. To boil all this information
down into one book is impossible, but to condense the most basic and impor-
tant information into one book is practical. Consider it done.
How This Book Is Organized
Like most For Dummies books, this is a reference and not a step-by-step tutor-
ial. Therefore, you can readily move to any part of the book to read about
something that interests you. For example, you may be well versed in basic
aquarium setup, but you may want to know more about fish. Simply skip to
Chapter 2; no need to read the first chapter. And don’t be afraid to take full
advantage of the Index.
When I decided to set up an aquarium all those many years ago, my immedi-
ate impulse was to go out and buy, buy, buy. Well, I did that and I learned a
few costly lessons right from the start.
Think of setting up a saltwater aquarium as building a small house. Actually,
you are building a small house — for your marine pets. To build a house, you
first have to decide why you are building one. Then you have to decide what
kind you want and where to purchase your materials. Setting up your aquar-
ium is no different (just a lot cheaper), and this book will help you take those
important steps.

Introduction

You will find that this book is written in a logical, progressive fashion from
the basics of fish anatomy to choosing an aquarium to routinely maintaining
it. I’ve divided this process into five parts, which proceed as follows.
Part I: Getting to Know Your 
Fish and Invertebrates
Of course, what good is an aquarium if you don’t have something living in it?
Hence, after this brief introductory chapter (Chapter 1), the balance of this
part introduces you to the biology and selection of your new pets. I start
with the basics of fish biology (Chapter 2) and move you through the
process of selecting the right tank inhabitants for your aquarium (Chapter 3).
These chapters are, in my opinion, the most enjoyable part of the book because
fish are truly unique creatures and enjoyable pets. Just as selecting a new dog
or cat can be fun, so can finding the right fish for your aquarium. But the fun
does not stop at fish as I also include an invertebrate chapter (Chapter 4).
Finally, choosing new pets is one thing, but getting them home is another.
Hence, I close out this part by telling you how to do that in Chapter 5.
Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium
The six chapters in this part of the book help you to move from having
no aquarium at all through the process of selecting one and setting it up.
This section of the book starts with a chapter (Chapter 6) on choosing the
right aquarium, then walks you through a series of chapters on choosing fil-
ters (Chapter 7), heating and lighting fixtures (Chapter 8), and the myriad
of other aquarium components (Chapter 9). In Chapter 10, I even discuss
brackish water aquariums before telling you how to actually set up your
aquarium in the final chapter (Chapter 11). If you read all these chapters, the
empty space in your home that you have been eyeing as a perfect spot for an
aquarium will be filled with a well-chosen, well-equipped aquatic ecosystem.
Part III: Taking Proper Care 
of Your Aquarium
If I had to choose a part of the book that is the most important, then this is it.
Unfortunately, it is also the part that most people find to be the most compli-
cated. If you were reading a book written 20 years ago, then perhaps it would
be. But not any more. In these four chapters, I introduce you to what you
4
Saltwater Aquariums For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

need to know about water chemistry starting with the ugly “n” word, nitrogen
(Chapter 12), followed by a chapter on the other important water quality
indicators (Chapter 13). In this part, I also discuss the common aquarium 
nuisance known as algae (Chapter 14) and the simple steps of aquarium
upkeep (Chapter 15).
Trust me, these are not difficult topics, and you will agree with me after all
is read and done. Think of this section as having to go to the gas station
to fuel your car. Everybody loves having the luxury and joy of a car, yet
nobody really enjoys having to stop for gasoline every couple of hundred
miles, but you can’t have one without the other. So to enjoy the benefits
of your aquarium, you need to keep it moving smoothly with some basic
maintenance.
Part IV: Taking Proper Care of Your Fish
Much as the last part on basic aquarium upkeep does for the equipment, the
four chapters in this part show you how to keep your fish running smoothly.
In these chapters, I discuss how to feed your fish (Chapter 16) and how to
keep them healthy (Chapter 17). There are not a lot of effective treatments
for fish and invertebrate diseases, so the best care is preventative care
(Chapter 18). In the final chapter (Chapter 19) of this section, I discuss some
of the basics of fish and invertebrate observation. This is very important for
assessing the health of your pets.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Here I’ve compiled some informative lists of who not to include in your
aquarium as well as some helpful, if you can believe it, mathematical equa-
tions. In the first two chapters, I list ten fishes (Chapter 20) and ten inverte-
brates (Chapter 21) that are not well suited for the saltwater aquarium of a
beginner. And because not all of us speak the same language when it come
to measurements, I show you how to convert from U.S. units like inches to
metric units like centimeters in Chapter 22. Chapter 23 lists some of the best
public saltwater aquariums.
Part VI: Appendixes
In the two appendixes, you will find a list of additional resources, such as
clubs, magazines, and the Internet (Appendix A) as well as a glossary of fish
and aquarium terms (Appendix B).

Introduction

Icons Used in This Book
As is typical of For Dummies books, a number of small pictures called icons
appear in the margins of this book that highlight various aspects of the text.
Here’s what they mean:
When you see this icon, it means that the paragraph next to it is particularly
good advice that will help you accomplish the task at hand or information
that will keep your aquarium and its inhabitants healthy.
As you would expect, this icon is indicative of a potential problem or dangerous
situation associated with the topic being discussed. Pay particular attention
to these because they may involve your fish, but are more likely to affect you
and those around you.
In most cases, this icon highlights information that is technical by nature and
not critical to the task at hand. If you are simply not interested in the topic,
pass over it.
If I use this icon it means that I want you to make a special effort to remem-
ber the point that I am making. I try not to do this too often, but some infor-
mation needs to be emphasized and reemphasized so that it sinks in. Most of
this is common sense. For example, the correct temperature for a tropical
aquarium is important to remember, but I won’t ask you to commit the chemi-
cal composition of seawater to memory.
Where to Go from Here
Well, now that we have had an opportunity to meet, it’s time to move on to
the real important stuff: saltwater aquariums. Where you go from here largely
depends on your personal level of expertise. If you have never owned an
aquarium, then simply turn the page, and let’s start at square one. If, how-
ever, you already have some saltwater pets in mind and want to start by
building your aquarium, go to Part II. Perhaps you want to review the Table of
Contents or Index and see what topics tickle your fancy. Go for it. Enjoy!

Part I
Getting to Know
Your Fish
and Invertebrates

In this part . . .
T
his part introduces you to the biology and selection of
your new pets. I begin with the basics of fish biology
and go through selecting the right aquarium inhabitants,
including invertebrates. Finally, I go through the process
of getting your pets home.

Chapter 1
Your First Salty Steps
In This Chapter
 Experiencing the joy of having an aquarium
 Understanding aquarium pets and what they need
 Choosing the right equipment
 Maintaining a healthy aquarium
 Keeping your fish happy and healthy
You can find a variety of reasons to purchase, set up, and maintain a
healthy aquarium in your home. Perhaps your child wants a saltwater
aquarium, and you’re wrestling with the decision. In this chapter, I help you
make that decision with a broad overview of what saltwater aquarium keep-
ing entails.
Perhaps the best way to describe the experience of having an aquarium is to
tell you why I started keeping an aquarium when I was young. Prompted by
the early television shows of underwater explorer Jacques Cousteau, I was
in awe of the ocean and its inhabitants, particularly tropical coral reefs
and all the beautiful creatures that inhabit them. During those same years,
I was fortunate to travel to the coral reefs of the Caribbean and swim among
those very creatures. Swimming about the reef with a mask and a snorkel, I
explored all the nooks, watched the fish, and admired the beauty for hours
and hours. Soon I learned to scuba dive and take underwater photos, but that
wasn’t enough, especially when I had to return to cold Connecticut waters.
I had to have these animals in my home all the time. So I set up an aquarium
and was able to experience much of what I enjoyed while swimming with
the fish. Later, inspired by these childhood experiences, I became a marine
biologist.

What’s So Great About Aquariums?
Not everybody has had the opportunity to explore the coral reefs of the
Caribbean, but most have seen the beauty of these areas on television.
Yet why watch them on TV when you can see the creatures live in your
home and at a fraction of the cost of traveling to the tropics?
Fish watching
I can watch fish for hours, but, admittedly, I’m a bit strange. Still, the more
you watch your aquarium, the better off your aquarium will be. You’ll get to
know all the subtleties of your fish; you’ll name them; you’ll know about their
individual personalities (oh, they have them); you’ll watch as they interact;
and, most importantly, you’ll know immediately if something isn’t quite right.
Each animal in your aquarium is your pet, and, like any pet, by watching it
daily, you’ll know when it acts normally and when something is wrong.
You can diagnose problems as they arise and not after it’s too late.
Relaxation
Fish and invertebrates are entertaining creatures, and just sitting and watch-
ing them can be very relaxing. As far as I’m concerned, relaxation is one of
the very best reasons to have an aquarium. Studies show that spending time
in front of the aquarium reduces stress. Also, if you have insomnia, try fish
watching — count fins, not sheep.
A fishy family affair
It may sound a bit corny, but fishkeeping is fun for the whole family. By bring-
ing the kids into the process, you help them learn the responsibility involved
in taking care of pets. Every child will want to feed the fish, and you can show
them how to do it properly. Daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance duties
become easier if they’re shared by all. Also, if everybody has a vested inter-
est in the aquarium, the aquarium will be better off. In fact, family pets often
get more attention than those owned by a single person.
Your child may want an aquarium and promise to take care of it. Please real-
ize, however, that with any pet, he or she has to commit to maintaining the
aquarium. The responsibilities are similar to those associated with keeping
a dog or cat. The child may not always have the high level of interest he or
10
Part I: Getting to Know Your Fish and Invertebrates 

she expresses early on. You have to be prepared to not only emphasize the
importance of aquarium maintenance to your child but also be willing to pick
up the slack for him or her.
Fishy friends
You aren’t the only one who will enjoy your aquarium. How many times have
you been to a friend’s house who has an aquarium, and you couldn’t help but
check it out? So, too, will your friends when they visit. Think of your aquar-
ium as a pet and a piece of furniture combined. People appreciate a house
that’s nicely decorated, and people generally like pets. Your aquarium will
offer both amenities at once, and you’ll be the talk of the town.
It’s a natural thing
Perhaps you too are an aspiring marine biologist. I can think of no better way
of getting started than by owning an aquarium. Many studies on fish biology
have been conducted on animals kept in aquaria. In fact, much of what scien-
tists know about marine life comes from studies on captive fish. Fish and
invertebrates are living animals that eat, grow, exhibit unique behaviors, and
act and react to their environment and to other animals. As an amateur biolo-
gist, you can discover a lot about fish in your own home. The whole family
will understand the importance of and gain a respect for nature by having a
piece of it in your own home.
The study of fish is known as ichthyology. Scientists who study the biology of
fish are known as ichthyologists. That means that by owning an aquarium with
fish in it, you become an amateur ichthyologist.
The ideal pet
Have you ever had to quiet a dog, clean up an unsightly pet mess, go find the
cat, or hope that the mailman doesn’t get bitten? If you answer yes to any of
these, you know what owning a typical pet is like. Fish, on the other hand,
never give you these problems. They don’t bark or bite or scratch. If you’re
tired of dealing with the typical pet, try the tropical pet instead.
Keeping an aquarium requires a commitment. If you can’t commit to your
tropical fish, either drop the idea or wait until you can make that commit-
ment. You wouldn’t get a dog if you didn’t have time to feed it, so don’t get an
aquarium if you can’t take care of it.

Chapter 1: Your First Salty Steps

Knowing About Wet Pets
Most of the ornamental fishes sold in pet stores are freshwater fish, many of
which are spawned and raised in captivity. Although they represent only a
fraction of the number of fishes sold, almost all the saltwater species are har-
vested from the wild. This means that almost any fish or invertebrate that
you buy for your saltwater aquarium has been captured and taken from its
native habitat.
The most popular of these saltwater fish come primarily from coral reefs.
Of course, natural reef systems can be hurt if great care isn’t taken to protect
them and harvest fish wisely. If managed properly, the coral reefs around the
world can be harvested without harm because they are extremely produc-
tive. Take care, however, not to purchase fish that may have been harvested
in areas that don’t adhere to the sound conservation of natural reefs. If you
can, try to purchase captive bred fish.
To make sure that your fish are harvested without harm to the environment,
check with the Marine Aquarium Council (www.aquariumcouncil.org).
Saltwater aquarium pets typically include both fish and invertebrates. In
Chapter 2, I go into great detail about fish and not only tell you about their
scales, fins, and gills, but I also give you an overview of the fish families that
you’re most likely to encounter in the pet store. Knowing all about fish fami-
lies is one thing, but which fishes are right for you? Well, Chapter 3 helps you
choose those fish species that are best for the beginner and tells you about
fish that school, fish that are active at night, and even those species best
avoided. 
Invertebrates, however, are different from fish. They belong to many kinds of
groups, such as insects, clams, corals, and worms. The basic feature that
unites invertebrates is the fact that they lack a backbone. In Chapter 4, you
find out all about invertebrate groups, how they are classified, who’s who,
and which ones would make nice additions to your aquarium. After reading
Chapter 4, you will know that invertebrates for the aquarium include shrimp,
coral, and anemones, to name a few.
Finding a really fishy dealer
Finding and establishing a rapport with the right dealer is important to the
entire aquarium process, from the initial purchase to treating diseases to
troubleshooting. This book gets you started and helps you keep a healthy
12
Part I: Getting to Know Your Fish and Invertebrates 

aquarium, but no book can anticipate all the new developments in the aquar-
ium trade that your dealer will have immediate access to.
You want to establish a good working relationship with your aquatic dealer
because you need someone to advise you during the setup and maintenance
of your system. You want somebody who maintains a good, clean business,
has healthy fish in his or her aquariums, and is always willing to answer your
questions and spend time with you. A good dealer gives you invaluable infor-
mation on new and reliable products. He or she is motivated by the desire to
help you to maintain your system correctly — not solely by money.
Choose someone with the right attitude: someone who will be consistently
available to help. Try to avoid dealers who don’t take the time to explain
details to you or find the specific fish that you desire. I prefer the pet shops
that cater to the needs of all levels of enthusiasts, are willing to special order
supplies, and would rather send you elsewhere than sell you an improper
choice.
If you’ve worked successfully with a freshwater aquarium dealer in the past,
this would be the logical place to start with your marine interests.
Getting your new pets home from the dealer is explained in Chapter 5.
Although this is a pretty straightforward process, you discover that mini-
mizing the stress of travel is as important as the way you place the fish into
your tank.
Understanding Your Responsibilities
Fish and invertebrates kept in an aquarium live in an artificial environment
and are faced with several challenges to survival. Unfortunately, most of
these challenges can’t be met by the fish and must be provided by you, the
aquarist. When you take it upon yourself to set up an aquarium, you’re
accepting the responsibility of meeting all the needs of its inhabitants.
Without you, your aquarium and all its occupants are doomed.
Your responsibilities include ensuring high water quality, proper feeding, cor-
rect water temperature, a balanced fish community of the proper density,
appropriate habitat and shelter, and sufficient lighting — to name a few.
Your fish are no longer in the wild; they are your pets, and they need you.
The fish are totally dependent on you to meet their everyday needs. If they
get sick or diseased, you must treat them.

Chapter 1: Your First Salty Steps

In Table 1-1, I’ve put together a short list of the biological needs of your fish
and invertebrates. I’ve also included the kinds of equipment that provide for
these needs in order to introduce you to some common aquarium compo-
nents, and I’ve highlighted the corresponding chapter in this book.

Getting Started with Your 
First Saltwater Aquarium
By taking the time to properly plan your aquarium now, you can save a lot of
time and money down the road. After all, you want to set it up once and set it
up right.
What equipment do I need?
In order to meet the needs of your fish that are highlighted in Table 1-1,
you should buy much of your equipment right from the start. After all, you
can’t bring home any fish from your dealer unless you have something to put
them into.
Part II of the book tells you about the equipment essential to a successful
marine aquarium:
14
Part I: Getting to Know Your Fish and Invertebrates 

 Chapter 6 describes aquarium tanks and tells you where and on what to
set up the new aquarium.
 Chapter 7 helps you understand filtration and describes the many kinds
of filters. By reading this chapter, you will also know what kind of filter
to buy. Of course, Chapter 7 also explains that adding oxygen to the
water is very important. Hence, you find out about aerators and other
equipment for doing so.
 Chapter 8 offers valuable information about heating and lighting your
aquarium. Because most species of fish and invertebrates come from
tropical waters, heating your aquarium is very important; this chapter
tells you how to do so. Tropical regions are also known for bright sun-
shine, and lighting your aquarium is equally important. Many kinds of
lights are available, and the one you choose much depends on whether
you plan to house invertebrates; Chapter 8 helps you make the right
choice.
 Chapter 9 brings together all the odds and ends necessary to round out
your aquarium. These items include aquarium gravel, rocks and coral,
and, of course, salt. Other equipment, such as cleaning tools, nets, and
water quality test kits are needed to maintain a healthy aquarium.
These items are also discussed in Chapter 9 because you may as well
buy them now.
What about brackish water aquariums?
Although most folks reading this book are interested in aquariums that are
strictly salt water, some are interested in aquariums that are not quite fresh
and not quite salt. Chapter 10 is a special chapter dedicated to brackish
water aquariums. This kind of aquarium is for those who would like to keep
critters and plants that live in areas where fresh water and salt water meet.
These aquariums have less salt in them than the average marine aquarium.
Chapter 10 explains brackish water systems and their inhabitants and tells
you what you need to set one up.
How do I set up the aquarium?
Chapter 11 puts all the pieces of the saltwater aquarium puzzle together and
tells you how to set up the system from start to finish. However, unlike the
typical freshwater aquarium, the marine system needs to mature as your 
filtration starts to work. Therefore, you really can’t add fish until your aquar-
ium has had a chance to establish itself over a couple of weeks. How will you
know? That depends on water chemistry.
15
Chapter 1: Your First Salty Steps

Understanding Water 
Chemistry and Algae
Before you can add fish to your new saltwater aquarium, you need to estab-
lish and maintain excellent, well-balanced water quality through filtration.
This means that you need to understand a little bit about water chemistry.
But don’t panic. It may sound complex, but it’s actually pretty simple.
In Part III, you discover these important new concepts:
 Chapter 12 tells you about the importance of nitrogen in your aquarium
and shows you the simple way to monitor nitrogen levels.
 Chapter 13 offers you greater detail about some of the other water 
components that you already know about, like salt, oxygen, and pH.
Monitoring these aspects of water quality is simple and important for
maintaining a healthy system.
 Chapter 14 gives you more than you ever wanted to know about algae,
the marine plant-like inhabitant of your aquarium. Algae, in general, are
good for your system, but can be a nuisance if the wrong kinds explode
in your tank.
Knowing all this water chemistry is important only if you put it to good use.
Chapter 15 outlines the important daily, weekly, and monthly steps that you
need to take to keep your aquarium clean and, therefore, your new pets happy.
These simple activities, which may take only a minute or two, provide the
preventive upkeep so that you can avoid future problems.
Keeping Your Fish and 
Invertebrates Healthy
With good choices for your first aquarium pets (Part I), the right equipment
(Part II), and well-balanced water chemistry (Part III), you are well prepared
to keep your fish and invertebrates alive and happy. Adding them to the new
system is pretty straightforward (Chapter 5), but keeping them healthy
involves good food, the prevention of stress, and the right treatments for 
disease (Part IV).
16
Part I: Getting to Know Your Fish and Invertebrates 

What do I feed my fish and invertebrates?
Chapter 16 explains that some fish eat other fish and invertebrates, some eat
strictly algae and plants, and some eat both. You need to meet the dietary
needs of your new pets, and Chapter 16 tells how, when, and how much to
feed your fish and invertebrates.
What if my wet pets get sick?
The best way to treat disease in your saltwater aquarium is prevent it.
Fish and invertebrates that are stressed by poor water quality, other tank inhab-
itants, or poor feeding may ultimately get sick. Chapter 17 explains the concept
of stress and how to prevent it and, thereby, avoid disease altogether.
If, however, one of your aquarium inhabitants does get sick, Chapter 18 tells
you how to diagnose the disease and treat it. Of course, you won’t be able to
tell if your fish are sick unless you pay attention to them. Therefore, Chapter 19
offers some great information about how to observe and enjoy your aquarium
inhabitants. This chapter tells you how to watch your pets, keep an aquarium
log, and even take pictures.
Avoiding the Wrong Aquarium Pets
As collection and captive breeding techniques improve, you will find more and
more species of fish and invertebrates offered at your pet store. However, not
all these critters are compatible, well suited for the beginner, or prove easy to
keep in captivity.
Chapters 20 and 21 provide two simple lists of ten kinds of fish and inverte-
brates to avoid for a variety of reasons. This does not mean that you can’t
eventually keep some of these critters in your tank, but, in some cases, you
may simply need a little more experience before doing so.
Taking the Next Step
Now that you know what this book has to offer, you’re ready to take the
plunge and tackle the rest of it.

fascination with the beauty of the critters that live in the sea. I share that fas-
cination with you — in this chapter, I share some important information
about fish.
What Is a “Fish”?
The group of aquatic animals that we call fishes has been around for over
400 million years and is the most numerous and diverse of the major verte-
brate groups. (Vertebrates are different from invertebrates in that they have a
vertebral column, or backbone.)
You have seen me use the words fish and fishes, but you probably thought the
plural of fish was fish. Actually, when you’re referring to more than one kind
of fish, known as a species, the plural of fish is fishes, as in “there are many
kinds of fishes in the ocean.” However, when you’re talking about more than
one fish of the same kind, then the plural is fish, like “these damsels are beau-
tiful fish.”

20
Part I: Getting to Know Your Fish and Invertebrates 
Fishes have permeated all the waters of the world, adapting an incredible
variety of forms, lifestyles, and behaviors. From the seasonal freshwater
streams, desert springs, and salty bays to the coral reefs, open oceans, and
deep abyss, these incredible animals have found suitable homes. Well over
20,000 species of fishes currently inhabit the earth and many more are being
discovered every year.
Because salt water covers more than 70 percent of the earth’s surface, and fresh
water only 1 percent, you may expect to find many more marine (saltwater)
species than freshwater species of fishes. Surprisingly, though, only 58 per-
cent of the world’s fish species live exclusively in salt water. By far, most
(46 percent) of these live in the narrow band of water less than 700 feet deep
along coastlines. As you move into the warm tropical waters of coral reefs,
the number of species dramatically increases. It’s these fishes that are usu-
ally the most sought after for aquariums because of their incredible beauty.
Basics of Fish Anatomy
Because there are no less than 11,000 kinds (species) of marine fish, the 
“typical” fish is difficult to describe. However, for the most part, all fishes
have some common characteristics. Water is 800 times denser than air, so
fish have developed a variety of ways to move, breath, and feed in a dense
medium. These involve the body shape, fins, scales, and swim bladder (see
Figure 2-1)
Body shape
You can discover a great deal about a species of fish by looking at its body
shape. Fishes that are streamlined or bullet-shaped are specially adapted to
open water. A couple of examples of these fishes include tunas and sharks.
Flat or deep-bodied fish live on or close to the bottom. Just look at a flounder
and you’ll see what I mean. 
Fins
Almost all species of fish have fins in one form or another. The fins are criti-
cally important appendages that allow the fish to propel, stabilize, maneuver,
and stop. In many cases, fins are used to protect the fish, as well. Lionfish, for
example, have fins with long, protective, poisonous spines.

Depending on the type of fish and where it lives, the fins take on many
shapes and functions. Bottom, sedentary, and slower-moving fishes possess
rounded fins, whereas faster, open-water fishes generally have longer,
pointed fins.
In general, the supporting structures of fish fins are hard spines and soft rays.
Anyone who has handled a fish knows that the spines can be sharp. These
bony structures provide protection against predators, which can include
humans, of course.

Chapter 2: Some Things Fishy

Fins come in ones or twos, so they’re either paired or unpaired. Paired fins
include the pectorals and pelvics, whereas unpaired fins are the dorsal fins,
caudal fin, and anal fin.
Pectoral fins
These are the most forward fins, and if fish had arms, these would be them.
These fins act to help the fish stabilize, turn, maneuver, hover, and swim
backwards. The pectoral fins are generally found just behind or below the
gills on each side of the fish, under the midline of the body.
Pelvic fins
These are the leg fins, so to speak. They are also paired and are the most
variable in position. In some fishes, the pelvics lie under the fish toward the
rear. In others, like many tropical fishes, the pelvics are closer to the head
under the pectorals. In general, the pelvic fins act as brakes while helping to
stabilize and turn the fish.
Dorsal fin
This unpaired fin is found protruding from the top of the fish. The dorsal fin
helps to stabilize the fish and keep it moving straight. Dorsal fins may be long
or short, elaborate or simple, singular or multiple. The spines of the dorsal
fin can be sharp, and this makes handling some fish difficult. I’ve been
“spined” by a few fish, and it’s not a pleasant experience. The dorsal fins of
most fish fold down to help streamline the fish while it’s moving through the
water. However, the dorsal fins of sharks are rigid and don’t fold down, which
gives sharks their classic look as they move through the water. Some species
of fish, such as goldfish, don’t have a dorsal fin.
Anal fin
This is another unpaired fin that helps stabilize the fish when it swims. This
fin is located on the underside of the fish behind the anal vent and before the
tail fin.
Caudal fin
The caudal or tail fin is an unpaired fin that’s largely responsible for pro-
pelling the fish forward. This fin is the source of forward momentum for most
fishes and can also assist in turning and braking. The shape of the tail can tell
you a lot about the lifestyle of a fish. Faster fishes, like tuna and sharks, have
deeply forked tails, whereas many slower, deep-bodied, bottom fishes have
square or rounded tails. The tail of the eel is pointed, and this fish moves
along the bottom like a snake moves through the grass.
22
Part I: Getting to Know Your Fish and Invertebrates 

Scales
The bodies of most fish are covered with scales. The scales are composed of
a hard, bony substance and serve to protect the fish, reducing the chance of
injuries and infection. Covering the scales is a very thin layer of epidermal
(skin) tissue that contains mucous cells. These cells produce that slimy tex-
ture you feel when you pick up a fish. This mucous coating not only protects
the fish against injury and infection but also helps the fish to swim more easily
in the water, reducing the friction between the body and the dense medium.
The scales of a fish are actually translucent and lack color. The vibrant colors
of tropical fishes come from specialized pigment cells, called chromatophores,
in the deeper dermal layer of the skin. Fish that are clear, such as the fresh-
water glassfish, lack these pigments. The color of a fish depends on the
types of chromatophores present. There are generally three types in fish:
melanophores, xanthophores, and iridophores. Melanophores give fish the
darker colors of black, brown, and blue; xanthophores produce the colors of
red, yellow, and orange; and iridophores reflect light, producing a silvery
shine that’s common to many fishes.
The bodies of sharks and rays are covered with specialized scales called 
denticles. These actually look like tiny teeth that are pointed toward the tail
of the shark. The denticles have the texture of sandpaper and give the shark
that rough feeling, but only when you rub the shark toward its head. Not that
a lot of people have the opportunity to pet a shark!
Swim bladder
Living in the dense medium of water presents a few problems for fish, and
one of these is buoyancy. Maintaining a certain level in the water column
without having to expend a lot of energy is important if you live on and
about a coral reef. Therefore, most species of fish have a special organ
called the swim bladder. This gas-filled sac in the abdominal cavity of the
fish acts as a life vest that keeps the fish at the correct level in the water
column.
Fishes have many types of swim bladders, ranging from the simple single-
chambered sac of the trout to the three-chambered bladder of the codfish.
There are two types of mechanisms to fill the swim bladder with air. Some fish
have direct connections between the esophagus and the bladder and simply
swallow air to fill it. Others must rely on gas exchange from specialized blood
vessels in the circulatory system to fill the bladder.
23
Chapter 2: Some Things Fishy

In addition to its role in buoyancy control, the swim bladder also helps to
amplify sound for better hearing in certain species of fish.
Not all species of marine fish have swim bladders. For example, the sharks
and their close relatives, the rays, have large, fatty livers instead of swim
bladders to help maintain buoyancy. Their skeleton is composed of cartilage,
which also reduces their density in water. Many of the tunas also lack swim
bladders; their streamlined bodies and forward speed help them to maintain
buoyancy.
Feeding
Just as the body form of a fish can tell you a lot about its swimming habits,
the mouth can tell you something about its feeding habits. Bottomfeeders
have downward pointing mouths, whereas surface feeders have mouths that
are upward-pointing. However, for most tropical reef fishes, the mouth is at
the end of the snout.
The size of the mouth is usually related to the size of the fish’s preferred
food. For example, large predatory fish, like sharks and barracuda, have
large mouths armed with teeth for consuming other fish. On the other hand,
fishes that normally feed on small invertebrates, such as butterflyfish, have
smaller mouths. Some tropical marine fishes have specialized mouths for
specialized feeding strategies. The sharp “beak” of the parrotfish aids this
fish when feeding on the coral reef. The basking shark, which feeds on tiny
plankton, has a mouth that opens very wide and specialized gills that sift the
water.
Most marine fish have a relatively straightforward digestive system that
varies little from species to species. In general, food passes from the mouth,
down the esophagus, to the stomach, through the intestine, and out the anal
vent. However, several species of fish lack true stomachs and have elongated,
supercoiled intestines. Sharks and rays are different in that they possess a
specialized large intestine called the spiral valve.
Respiration
One of the most basic needs of fish is oxygen. Like land animals, fish are
living creatures that require oxygen to live. However, unlike other animals,
fish must obtain oxygen from the water in which they live. Hence, they have
specialized organs, called gills, that allow them to extract oxygen from the
water. The gills of a fish are similar to human lungs only to the extent that they
24
Part I: Getting to Know Your Fish and Invertebrates 

provide oxygen to and remove carbon dioxide from the blood. This oxygen is
then transported by the blood to the tissues, where it is utilized to produce
energy in a series of chemical reactions called respiration.
Although a few kinds of fish can breathe air from the water’s surface, without
gills, fish would certainly die. In addition, water contains much less oxygen
than air, and fish must breath ten to thirty times more water to get the same
amount of oxygen that a land animal would get from air.
Most fish have four gills on each side of the head, and they are protected by
a singular gill flap or operculum. Sharks and their relatives possess five to
seven gills, each with its own gillslit.
When a fish breathes, water is drawn into the mouth and passed over the
gills and out the operculum or gillslits. As water passes over the membranes
and filaments of the gills, oxygen is removed, and carbon dioxide is excreted.
To accomplish this, the gills have a high number of blood vessels that deliver
the oxygen to the rest of the fish via the blood. Oxygen and carbon dioxide
aren’t the only substances exchanged by the gills. Large amounts of ammonia
are also excreted by the gills, and as Chapter 12 discusses, ammonia is some-
thing that you need to get rid of as well (from the aquarium, that is).
Other organs
Fish typically possess general circulatory, digestive, respiratory, and nervous
system features common to most vertebrates. If you’re interested in finding
out more, examine the suggested reading list in Appendix A for more detailed
descriptions of the unique anatomy of fishes.
Senses
With few exceptions, fish have no less than five senses that they use to feed,
avoid predators, communicate, and reproduce.
Sight
The eyes of most fishes are similar to those of humans, except that they lack
eyelids, and their irises work much slower. Some species of sharks, however,
have special eyelid-type structures, called nictitating membranes, which pro-
tect the eyes. Fish eye lenses are spherical, which helps to focus light on the
retina underwater. The location of the lens in fish eyes makes most fish near-
sighted. Fish are generally thought to be able to detect color, although this
varies from species to species.
25
Chapter 2: Some Things Fishy

Rapid changes in light intensity tend to shock a fish, so be sure you provide
gradual changes in light to allow the fish to accommodate and avoid tempo-
rary blindness.
Sound
Water is a much more efficient conductor of sound than air. Therefore, sound
carries much farther and faster in water. Most fish don’t have noticeable
external ears, but they do have two inner ears. The auditory component of
the inner ear consists of the sacculus and the lagena, which house the sen-
sory components of hearing, the otoliths. Sound vibrations pass through the
water, through the fish’s body, and reverberate off the otoliths within the
inner ear. In some cases, the swim bladder articulates with the ear to amplify
the sound.
Hearing is an important sense for the fish. Although sharks and rays don’t
possess otoliths, their inner ear structure allows for the directional detection
of low-frequency sounds.
Smell
Every fish has external nostrils, called nares, which draw water into and
out of the olfactory organs located above its mouth and below its eyes.
Water flows through the nares and into the olfactory pits, where odors are
perceived and communicated to the brain via a large nerve.
The olfactory system of the fish isn’t attached to the respiratory system as it
is in humans, but remains isolated from the mouth and gills. Smell is particu-
larly important in prey and mate detection in fishes.
Taste
This sense in fishes is especially helpful in the identification of both food and
noxious substances. Although taste buds are only found in our mouths, those
of fish occur in the mouth and also on the external surfaces of the skin, lips,
and fins. Catfishes have special barbels with taste buds that help the fish to
detect food items in the murky waters in which they live.
Touch
Fish have a specialized sensory system called the lateral line, which allows
them to detect water movements. Sensory receptors lying along the surface
of the fish’s body in low pits or grooves detect water displacement and,
therefore, give the fish the sensation of touch. The lateral line is easily visible
along the sides of most fish. This unique system helps the fish detect other
fishes, sense water movement and currents, and avoid obstacles.
26
Part I: Getting to Know Your Fish and Invertebrates 

In addition to the lateral line system, sharks and rays possess sophisticated
sensory organs called the ampullae of Lorenzini, which allow them to detect
weak electrical fields. Imagine being able to find your prey by sensing the
electricity that it generates? This would allow you to hunt at night or to
detect a critter that is hiding in the sand.
Is It Fresh and Salted?
Just what are the differences between saltwater and freshwater fish? Why can’t
you just move a saltwater fish into fresh water and vice-versa? Put simply, it’s
because they would die, and in this section I explain why.
In general, the freshwater species of fish are hardier than their marine counter-
parts, having evolved to withstand the rapid and dramatic changes in water
conditions that occur inland. Most marine species have lived in constant and
stable environmental conditions. Therefore, they don’t have the ability to deal
with sudden changes, such as those that may occur in the home aquarium.
This, of course, makes saltwater fish more difficult to maintain in captivity.
As the name implies, salt water contains much higher concentrations of dis-
solved salt (sodium chloride) than fresh water does. Although salt is the
major constituent, there are many other dissolved elements as well, and they
all occur in higher concentrations than found in fresh water. The amount of
these dissolved “salts” in water is referred to as its salinity or specific gravity.
In Chapter 13, I discuss the chemistry of salt water in great detail, so I won’t
bore you with it here.
Osmosis
Because fish live in water, they are surrounded by the chemistry of the water
they live in. Also, keep in mind that a fish has water and dissolved salts in its
body, as well. So a fish surrounded by fresh water has more salts in its body
than outside its body, and a fish surrounded by salt water has fewer salts in
its body than outside.
Both of these situations can create real problems for the fish because the
process called osmosis causes water to flow through cell membranes from
areas of low salts (salinity) to areas of high salts. This means that fish in
fresh water are constantly subjected to an influx of water because their cells
are more saline than their environment. On the other hand, marine fish are
always threatened by the loss of water from their cells because their environ-
ment is more saline.
27
Chapter 2: Some Things Fishy

Osmoregulation
Although anatomically the two groups of fishes are similar in appearance,
they have evolved two very different ways of living in these chemically 
different environments. As a means of maintaining their internal salinity,
freshwater fish drink little water and produce large quantities of dilute urine.
On the other hand, most marine fish drink large quantities of water and elimi-
nate salts in small amounts of highly concentrated urine and feces, as well as
at the gills. So the kidneys of these groups are very different.
Sharks and their close relatives, the rays, are exceptions to this pattern in
marine fish. These species concentrate urea in their tissues and blood to
offset the loss of water.
This aspect of water balance in fish is called osmoregulation. It’s important
to understand the basic principles of osmoregulation because it has large
implications for fish held in captivity. Freshwater fish can’t be kept in salt
water and vice-versa because their bodies simply can’t adapt to the change.
As for saltwater fish:
 Marine fish must burn a lot of energy to prevent the loss of water and
excrete salt, so they require good nutrition and good health.
 Because marine fish drink large amounts of water, the quality of water
must be excellent.
 Abrupt changes in salinity disturb the internal chemistry of marine fishes.
Therefore, marine fishkeeping can be a little more difficult than the mainte-
nance of a freshwater system. But with a little extra effort, it can also be more
rewarding.
Common Tropical Marine Fish Families
In this section, I touch upon the various families of fish that commonly
inhabit coral reefs and whose members may be available for your tropical
marine aquarium. The diversity of these fishes is daunting. They are found
throughout the world along the band of warm water near the earth’s lower
latitudes. By no means is this a complete list of tropical marine fish families,
however, because there are literally thousands of species and hundreds of
families. (I strongly recommend that you consult with the references listed in
Appendix A for more comprehensive information about fish species). In this
28
Part I: Getting to Know Your Fish and Invertebrates 

section, I’ve included some illustrations of common members of these fami-
lies. You can also see beautiful color photos of specific fish species in the
color section of this book.
Angelfishes
The angelfishes are often confused with the butterflyfishes, having ornate
colors and deep, flattened bodies. The angels, however, belong to the family
Pomacanthidae and can be readily distinguished from the butterflies by the
presence of a spine on the gill cover. Angelfishes are popular aquarium fish
originating from coral reefs throughout the world. Some grow quite large,
exceeding 24 inches, but others rarely exceed a few inches. Angels come in a
variety of colors and patterns, sometimes changing as the fish matures from
juvenile to adult. In general, angelfish can be offered a variety of foods, but
some large adults can be somewhat finicky, preferring sponges and corals,
which means they can’t be kept in the reef tank. The pygmy or dwarf angels
like the one shown in Figure 2-2 are well suited for a home aquarium, whereas
other species of angelfish grow larger, are prone to being territorial, and do
better in larger public displays.

Blennies
These long, slender, very active fishes belong to the family Blenniidae, which
includes about 345 species. They generally live near, on, or in the bottom
and have comb-like teeth for cropping algae. Blennies prefer nooks and 
crannies for hiding. One blenny, the false cleanerfish, is known to mimic the
cleaner wrasse, but when the host fish approaches, this blennie bites off a
piece of fin instead of cleaning the fish. It’s best to avoid this critter. Blennies
generally eat a variety of foods, from algae to flake foods, and prefer hiding
30
Part I: Getting to Know Your Fish and Invertebrates 
What’s in a name?
As you know, humans have a tendency to name
living things. This is called taxonomyand it can be
a problem because humans speak many different
languages. So, for example, what we call a shark
is called a tiburon in Spanish. To get around the
confusion associated with language differ-
ences, a scientific naming scheme was set up
many years ago. The language that was chosen
for scientific naming is Latin. But don’t worry,
you don’t need to learn the entire language!
At the ultimate level, all fish and other living
creatures are classified into species. So, when
I say that there are over 11,000 kinds of marine
fishes, I mean that there are that many species.
A bluefish is one species, and a grouper is
another. When a species is scientifically classi-
fied, it is given a scientific name that is com-
posed of two parts: the genus and the species.
For example, the scientific name of the threadfin
butterflyfish is Chaetodon auriga, and that of the
spotfin butterflyfish is Chaetodon ocellatus. The
first (capitalized) name refers to the genus to
which both species belong. A genus is a scien-
tific grouping of similar species. If you look at
these two fish, you can see that they are
extremely similar. The second name refers only
to that species and no other.
This classification scheme continues as you
group similar genera (plural for genus) into fam-
ilies. Then you group similar families into orders,
similar orders into classes, and similar classes
into phyla (singular is phylum). All the different
phyla make up the kingdom that we call
Animalia, for the animals. There are also subdi-
visions of these categories, like suborder and
infraclass. It gets pretty complicated.
So, at the risk of boring you to tears, I’ll give
you an example: the Great White Shark has
the genus and species name of Carcharodon 
carcharias. It belongs to the family Lamnidae,
the order Lamniformes, the superorder Sela-
chimorpha, the subclass Elasmobranchii, the
class Chondrichthyes, the superclass Gnatho-
stomata, the subphylum Vertebrata, and the
phylum Chordata. Whew!
For the purposes of this book, I’m going to stick
with the most common names and the genus,
species, and family, so don’t worry about all this
classification stuff right now.

brates and fish).
Boxfishes and trunkfishes
The fish of the family Ostraciidae possess box-shaped bodies covered with
bony plates, and they have no pelvic fins. These fish release poisons into the
water when threatened and are, therefore, poorly suited for the average
aquarium. Boxfishes are generally bottomfeeders that can be intolerant of
their own kind.
Butterflyfishes
These popular aquarium fish belong to the family Chaetodontidae. They have
oval, flattened bodies, terminal mouths, and stunning color patterns like
those on the threadfin butterflyfish shown in Figure 2-3. The butterflies are
well adapted to life on the coral reef, feeding on the reef itself while seeking
algae, sponges, and corals. Although among the most beautiful, these aren’t
the hardiest of marine tropicals because they’re sensitive to changes in water
quality. Feeding in captivity can be difficult, and some species can be territor-
ial. These fishes aren’t recommended for the inexperienced fish hobbyist and
should not be kept in the reef tank because they consume invertebrates.

Chapter 2: Some Things Fishy

Cardinalfishes
This group of fish of the family Apogonidae includes almost 200 species
of slow-moving peaceful fishes. Large eyes, two separate erect dorsal fins,
and a large head are characteristic of these fish, as you can see in flamefish
shown in Figure 2-4. Although nocturnal, cardinals can be acclimated to 
daytime feeding and activity. When kept with other tranquil species in a 
community tank, these fish are well suited for both fish-only and the reef
tanks.
Catfishes
Although there are about 34 families of catfishes, only two have species that
live in salt water. The most common marine aquarium catfishes belong to the
family Plotosidae. These fish prefer to live in schools, so they are best kept in
groups. Some species do, however, have highly venomous spines, so take
care when handling them because the reaction to this venom can range from
mild inflammation to, in rare cases, death.
Clownfishes and damselfishes
These fishes are popular in the aquarium trade for all levels of experience.
Although comprising one family, the Pomacentridae, this group contains
315 species and is usually divided into the clownfishes and the damselfishes.
The clownfishes are also called anemonefishes because in the wild, these
small ornate fish are able to live unharmed among the stinging tentacles of
anemones, which are soft invertebrates related to corals (see Chapter 4). The
clowns and anemones live in harmony and both receive protection from the
relationship. This relationship can be mimicked in the aquarium as well, but
Figure 2-4:
The

a great addi-
tion to any
reef tank.
32
Part I: Getting to Know Your Fish and Invertebrates 

clownfishes don’t need anemones to survive in the aquarium. Clownfishes,
like the one shown in Figure 2-5, are one of the few groups of marine species
reared in captivity, and they do well in both reef and fish-only tanks.
Damselfishes are considered by many to be the hardiest of the marine aquar-
ium species and are, therefore, usually the first to be introduced into the new
aquarium. These fish, however, can be territorial and aggressive, and if intro-
duced too early to a new tank, less tolerant of new tank mates. Nonetheless,
some of the damsels, like the sergeant major shown in Figure 2-6 or the blue
green chromis, can be exciting additions to your tank, particularly when
introduced in shoals (schools). Many species of damselfish will harm inverte-
brates, so they don’t belong in the reef tank.

Chapter 2: Some Things Fishy

Dottybacks
These fish of the family Pseudochromidae are very similar to the fairy
basslets in size and appearance, yet they are distributed in the Indo-
West Pacific, whereas the latter are confined to the Caribbean. This family
contains the large genus Pseudochromis, comprised of about 40 species.
Unfortunately, some of the dottybacks can be highly territorial and 
must be kept alone. Use care when choosing the right species for a
peaceful marine aquarium. They adapt well to a reef tank with a lot of
hiding places.
Dragonets
The family Callionymidae has 130 species of small, shallow-water fishes
that live in the Indo-Pacific. Some species are drab colored and live over
sand, but others can be very colorful. Sometimes called mandarinfish,
these fishes eat tiny invertebrates and, therefore, thrive only in an estab-
lished reef tank.
Fairy basslets
There are only three species of basslets of the family Grammatidae. These
somewhat shy fish from the Caribbean prefer a lot of shelter, which they will
defend from other tank inhabitants. Although a beautiful addition to any tank,
the basslet’s finicky habits are best suited for the fish-only or reef tank of the
experienced hobbyist.
Filefishes
Like their close relatives the triggerfishes, filefishes of the family
Monocanthidae have a modified dorsal spine that locks into place. Unlike the
triggers, these fish are more peaceful, less active, and generally smaller,
making them better suited to a tropical community tank. However, you may
have difficulty getting these fish to feed in captivity, because they normally
feed on coral and algae.
34
Part I: Getting to Know Your Fish and Invertebrates 

Gobies
Somewhat similar in body shape to the blennies, the gobies belong to the family
Gobiidae (Figure 2-7). Gobies have modified pelvic fins that are united to form a
sucking disk. This family is the largest of the marine fishes, with over 200 genera
and 1,875 species. Some are able to live out of water for extended periods,
returning to water to wet their gills. Others live on sand or in close association
with invertebrates, such as sea urchins, sponges, hard and soft corals, and
shrimps. Like the blennies, gobies prefer hiding places and shelters. Some reef-
dwelling gobies, like the neon goby, act as “cleaner fish,” removing parasites
from other reef fishes at specified cleaning stations on the reef. Most gobies are
brightly colored, peaceful, and relatively small in size, eating a wide variety of
foods. They do well in fish-only tanks and are excellent additions to a reef tank.
Groupers and sea basses
Similar to the grunts and snappers, this group of fishes of the family Serranidae
includes fast-growing, large, predatory fishes. Most, therefore, require larger
fish-only aquaria if they are to be kept for any length of time. Nonetheless, with
over 450 species belonging to this family, a few smaller species are suitable
for the peaceful aquarium of the beginner. Many of the groupers are noctur-
nal, spending most of their daytime hiding or lying on the bottom.
Figure 2-7:
Gobies are

35
Chapter 2: Some Things Fishy

Grunts
These fast-growing, hardy fish are so named for the grunting noises they
make when their swim bladders amplify the sound generated by the grinding
of their teeth. Belonging to the family Haemulidae, the grunts accept a wide
variety of foods but require a lot of space. It is best to keep only small juveniles
in small schools. This family also contains the sweetlips fishes, which some
researchers consider to have their own family known as the Plectorhynchidae.
Originating in the Indo-Pacific, sweetlips fishes can be active like grunts, but
are excellent aquarium inhabitants as juveniles. They are generally brightly
colored as juveniles, like the yellow sweetlips in Figure 2-8, but become drab
as they get older. These fish have a quiet disposition, preferring a peaceful
fish-only tank without aggressive tank mates.
Hawkfishes
So named for their habit of perching themselves on a rock waiting to ambush
prey, the 32 species of hawkfishes belong to the family Cirrhitidae. With the
exception of four to five smaller species that are suitable for the home aquar-
ium, most hawkfishes are highly predatory and get too large in the peaceful
marine aquarium.

Lionfishes and scorpionfishes
No aquarium book is complete without mention of these unusual fishes of the
family Scorpaenidae. This family comprises over 300 species of fish with
stocky spiny heads and spiny fins armed with venom glands, like the lionfish.
They are generally predators that hover or lie in wait for their prey, suddenly
lunging at and engulfing it. Their often-camouflaged coloration aids them in
doing so. For obvious reasons, these fish must be handled with great care.
In captivity, they are generally peaceful but will readily consume smaller tank
mates. For now, I suggest avoiding them. They don’t belong in a reef tank.
Moray eels
These well known, unique fish belong to the family Muraenidae. The morays
lack pectoral fins but possess small gill openings and long, fang-like teeth.
Morays are generally nocturnal fish, feeding on other fish and invertebrates
at night, spending most of their daytime hours in holes and crevices. In the
wild, these fish will easily attain lengths in excess of five feet, but this size is
not common in the average aquarium. Although moray eels readily accept a
variety of foods, they are carnivorous and will consume smaller fish in the
aquarium. These fish are recommended for the fish-only aquarium.
Parrotfishes
Belonging to the same suborder as the wrasses, the parrotfishes are grouped
in the family Scaridae, which includes over 80 species. These fishes are
best known for their fused teeth that form a bird-like beak; hence the name.
The beak is used for biting off pieces of dead coral to get at the algae living
within it. For this reason, parrotfishes aren’t well suited for a reef aquarium.
In general, these fish get relatively large, which makes them a poor choice for
the average fish-only aquarium as well.
Porcupinefishes
These oddities of the marine aquarium belong to the family Diodontidae.
These fish, whose scales possess spines, have the ability to inflate their
bodies with water to ward off danger. Although relatively easy to keep in 
captivity, they generally attain too large a size for the average aquarist.
37
Chapter 2: Some Things Fishy

Puffers
Although the puffers look very much like porcupinefish without spines,
they are included in a different family called the Tetraodontidae. They are
smaller than the porcupines and have fused, beak-like jaws. These fish
will also inflate as a defense mechanism to avoid being eaten. Their flesh
is poisonous when consumed. These fish are vigorous feeders in the aquar-
ium, and some species can be aggressive. Smaller puffers, though, like the
spotted sharpnose shown in Figure 2-9, are well suited for the beginner’s
aquarium.
Rabbitfishes
The family Siganidae originates from the Indo-Pacific and contains two genera
and about a dozen species. Their flattened, oval bodies and small mouths are
similar to those of surgeonfishes. Like rabbits, they prefer to browse on vege-
tative matter in the wild; in the aquarium, they will consume algae and can be
lured into taking vegetable foods as well. These fish possess venom glands in
their dorsal and anal spines, so use care when handling them. Many rabbit-
fish grow fast, so adequate swimming space is required in either a fish-only
or reef tank.

Part I: Getting to Know Your Fish and Invertebrates 

Seahorses and pipefishes
These exotic fishes of the family Syngnathidae are no strangers to the aquarium
trade. The pipefishes lack the prehensile (wrapping and folding) tail, vertical
swimming position, and angled head that are characteristic of the seahorse.
Unfortunately, their feeding and water-quality requirements make them difficult
for a beginner to maintain in an aquarium for any length of time. They don’t
compete well with other species for food. These fish are peaceful and do best
in a quiet aquarium by themselves. The group is characterized by unusual
reproductive behavior where the female deposits eggs into an abdominal pouch
on the male. They are then fertilized and incubated by the male in this pouch.
Sharks
Scientists have identified at least 31 families and over 375 species of sharks
in the world, most of which have never been kept in aquaria. Sharks and
their relatives, the rays, are different from the rest of the fish in this chapter.
Their skeletons are composed of cartilage, they have teeth-like scales, and
they have five to seven gillslits. Therefore, they belong to a completely differ-
ent class of fish known as Chondrichthyes. Sharks in general grow too large
for the home aquarium, can be, shall we say, very aggressive, and are sensi-
tive to water quality. For these reasons alone, sharks aren’t recommended for
the average saltwater aquarium.
Snappers
These fish of the family Lutjanidae with over 200 species are another group of
fast-growing, highly active fishes that aren’t suitable as adults for the average
marine aquarium. Several species in this family are commercially exploited
for food throughout the world. These fish are predatory by nature, require a
lot of space, and will quickly dominate an aquarium.
Squirrelfishes
These red fishes of the family Holocentridae are normally nocturnal creatures
in the wild, using their large eyes to feed at night. The family also includes
the big eyes and soldierfish. In the aquarium, they can be conditioned to feed
during the day. Their long bodies have two dorsal fins: a longer fin of spines
39
Chapter 2: Some Things Fishy

and a shorter, soft-rayed fin close to the tail. Squirrelfish need a lot of space
to accommodate their highly active nature and may be disruptive to a peace-
ful tank. In addition, they may consume smaller fish as they get larger. They
prefer to live in schools and do well in a fish-only tank.
Surgeonfishes and tangs
These common aquarium fish belong to the family Acanthuridae. They are
characterized by high-profile, flattened, oval bodies. Their name is derived
from the presence of two scalpel-like spines at the base of the caudal fin
(tail). These are used in defense or during territorial disputes, so it’s best to
keep them alone. These schooling fish are algal grazers (feeding on algae) in
the wild as well as in captivity, but can be trained to take other kinds of food,
as well. In the wild, they reach sizes in excess of 15 inches, but rarely reach
half this size in captivity, depending on the species. Surgeonfish and tangs,
like the one shown in Figure 2-10, can be kept in both fish-only and reef
aquariums.
Triggerfishes
So named for their first dorsal fin that locks into place, triggerfishes, like
the one in Figure 2-11, belong to the family Balistidae, which includes over
130 species. Sound production in this group is common, produced by grind-
ing the teeth or vibrating the swim bladder. The legendary Hawaiian name for
the triggers is humahuma nukunuku apua’a, which means “the fish that sews
with a needle and grunts like a pig.” I’ll stick to triggerfish! They can also
rotate their eyes independently. The triggerfishes can be quite aggressive,
having sharp teeth that are ideal for feeding on invertebrates in the wild.
Figure 2-10:
Tangs, like
this one, will

Part I: Getting to Know Your Fish and Invertebrates 

They readily accept any food in captivity, but their aggressive nature makes
them unsuitable for the reef tank. These fish move primarily by using their
dorsal and anal fins, saving the tail for emergencies.
Wormfishes
At one time included with the blennies and gobies, the family Microdesmidae
contains 60 species of fishes that inhabit mostly tropical seas. Also called fire-
fishes, the wormfishes have an eel-like body with an extended first dorsal ray.
In the wild, these fish hover in groups close to the reef, feeding on small plank-
tonic animals. They rapidly retreat to nooks in the reef when startled. These
fishes can be kept in small groups, but they require plenty of hiding spaces.
Wrasses
The family Labridae has over 500 species all over the world, not only in 
tropical waters. This group can be quite diverse with its members having a
variety of body shapes, behaviors, and sizes. Many wrasse species are capa-
ble of changing sex as needed for reproductive purposes. Some are substrate
burrowers that require sand, whereas others, like the canary wrasse, rest in
crevices at night. Some members perform cleaning services similar to those
provided by a few species of gobies. The more active species of wrasses can
be disruptive to a peaceful tank, aggressive toward smaller fishes, or too
large for the average aquarium. Most wrasses have special jaw plates, called
pharyngeal jaws, that allow them to grind crabs, clams, snails, and sea
urchins. Hence, keep them out of the reef tank.

Chapter 3
Choosing the Best Fish for You
In This Chapter
 Understanding fishy habits
 Finding the right — and wrong — fish for starters
I
n Chapter 2, I discuss the anatomy of fish and the general types (families)
that are available to you. Now it’s time to narrow your choices. To do so,
you need a little more information about your options.
By far, the majority of marine fishes sold by pet dealers come from warm,
tropical coral reefs. Brilliant colors, unique body shapes, and animated
behavior make these fish preferred saltwater tank inhabitants. The coral reef
system is a diverse community of algae, invertebrates, and vertebrate animals
that function as a whole — it’s the foundation upon which the community is
built. For many species of fish, the coral reef is their home, providing food,
protection, and companionship.
A number of fishes are well suited for the community marine aquarium. The
important thing to do is to balance the types of fishes in your tank. Species of
fish have varying lifestyles and different behaviors. Therefore, some fish live
throughout the tank, some in the middle, and some on the bottom. There are
fishes that are compatible with invertebrates, and there are those that gobble
them up. Some fishes are active in the daytime, some thrive at night. In your
aquarium, you want to re-create the natural coral reef community by having
fish at all activity levels, thereby minimizing competition, utilizing the entire
aquarium, and creating a well-balanced community.
Like Night and Day
Fish, like most organisms, respond to changing light levels. This means that
their activity patterns are tuned to day and night. Most of these activity pat-
terns involve feeding or reproduction.

Fishes that are more active and feed during the day are called diurnal, and
those that feed at night are called nocturnal. Because most of the fishes 
available for your aquarium are caught in the wild, they will exhibit similar
patterns in your home.
Although some species may adapt to a diurnal lifestyle, you want to make
sure that you don’t stock your tank with fishes that are all nocturnal. I’ve put
together a list of nocturnal and diurnal species in Table 3-1, which you can
use as a general guide when you purchase your fish.

Advanced Schooling
Many species of fish form natural groups that we refer to as schools. Fishes
swim in schools not to get smarter but to increase feeding success and to
avoid predators. As many as half of all fish species form schools at some
point in their lives. Some species, such as herrings, school for their entire
lives, and others, like puffers, school only as juveniles.
Many authors use the terms shoals and schools interchangeably, but this is
not correct. Technically, shoals are groups of fish that are unorganized, and
schools are groups of fish that are synchronized and polarized.
Schooling fish are an attractive addition to the aquarium. They add action to
the tank because they rarely stop moving. They also increase the visibility
and activity levels of their tank mates.
Of course, if you add schooling fish to your aquarium, don’t try to mimic the
numbers that occur in the wild. Your tank is simply too small, no matter how
big it is. Keep the size of your school small, no more than five or six fish,
taking into account the capacity of your aquarium. Also, it’s not a good idea
to buy one schooling fish and keep it alone. Imagine what that would feel like.
Trouble in Paradise
Fish, like all animals, interact with each other in a variety of ways. This inter-
action can occur with individuals of the same species as well as between
species.
Aggressive interactions are referred to as agonistic. Agonistic behavior
between fish can be due to defense of a territory, a predatory attack, compe-
tition for food, or protection of mates, eggs, or young. Agonistic behavior
usually results in a pecking order forming, in which some fish are subordinate
to others. This is particularly true for coral reef fishes.
Of course, fish in the wild have a higher probability of avoiding each other.
But when you bring fish into your home, they’re forced to deal with each
other in the confined space of your aquarium. Does this mean that they’re
always going to get along? No way! Take care to choose fish that are compati-
ble, considering the elements discussed in the three following sections when
selecting your new pets.
45
Chapter 3: Choosing the Best Fish for You

Size
One aspect of choosing fish that the novice will sometimes overlook is the
maximum size of a particular species. A fish grows continuously throughout
its life, and some species grow faster than others. You don’t want a fish that
will grow to 12 inches in less than a year. This situation will not only disrupt
your aquarium capacity, but the larger fish will also undoubtedly dominate
the tank. Some species are compatible with other species when they are
smaller juveniles, but become solitary and aggressive as adults. These fish
don’t belong in the peaceful reef tank (an invertebrate aquarium with a few
peaceful fishes) or fish-only tank.
Keep in mind that in the wild, bigger fish usually eat smaller fish and inverte-
brates. This will also happen in your aquarium, and it is just one more reason
to keep large fishes out of the average aquarium.
To be safe and avoid the event of one fish becoming the dinner of another,
keep fishes of similar size in the fish-only and reef aquarium.
Attitude
Have you ever met somebody who always seems to have a bad attitude? Well,
I have, and I’ve met a few fish like that, too. Some species simply have a surly
disposition. Whether it’s because they’re territorial, defensive, or just plain
hungry, these fish are not for the reef tank and don’t fit into most peaceful
fish-only aquariums.
The best advice I can give you is to avoid aggressive fishes. Use the guides in
both Chapter 2 and in this chapter to determine whether the species that you
want is a problem child. Also, just because this book, another book, or a
dealer tells you that a species isn’t normally aggressive doesn’t mean that
your fish will be docile. Many species that are considered peaceful have been
known to have a few bad seeds. Take the time to discuss your options with
your dealer and keep a watchful eye on any new tank addition. If one of his
fish is aggressive, the dealer should tell you (at least you hope he will), or
you will undoubtedly find out one way or another. This is a good reason to
establish a good rapport with a dealer.
Diet
In addition to size and attitude, always consider the diet of your tank inhabi-
tants. In Chapter 16, I discuss feeding in greater detail, but in the “Finding
Good Choices” section in this chapter, I offer some recommended fishes
46
Part I: Getting to Know Your Fish and Invertebrates 

with their food preferences. Fish definitely have a variety of food preferences.
Be wary of predatory fish, called carnivores, because they eat other fish and
invertebrates.
You really don’t want to add large predators to your reef tank or fish-only tank:
It’s a bad mix (at least for the prey). In addition, don’t choose fish that are going
to be difficult to feed. For example, it’s hard to feed fish with specialized
diets, like those that eat only corals. Use the guide to fishes in this chapter
(in the “Finding Good Choices” section) and always consult with your dealer.
Habitat for Serenity
Without a doubt, fish have preferred habitats. The term habitat really just
refers to the type of environment that a fish inhabits. For example, flounders
prefer to live in a sandy-bottom habitat, and you’re not likely to see one
swimming at the surface. The best saltwater aquarium is well balanced with
fishes that inhabit all levels of the tank. A couple of bottom dwellers, a couple
of topwater fellas, and a few mid-water critters presents the most natural and
pleasing appearance. It keeps any one part of the tank from getting over-
crowded and helps to avoid agonistic interactions.
Know where your fishes come from. This way you can not only impress your
friends but also keep a region-specific natural aquarium with fishes from only
one region of the world, if you so choose.
Tropical marine fishes come from four major regions of the world. In the
“Finding Good Choices” section, I tell you where specific fish come from and
refer to the following regions for the fish that I recommend:
 Indo-West Pacific: From South Africa and the Red Sea east through
Indonesia and Australia to Hawaii and the South Pacific Islands to Easter
Island. About 3,000 species live in this region, the most of any region.
 Eastern Pacific: This region extends from the western coast of North
America south along the tropical shores of Central America to the tropi-
cal and temperate shores of western South America. This region is sepa-
rated from the Indo-West Pacific region by a huge expanse of ocean, and
it contains fewer than 1,000 species.
 Western Atlantic: This region includes the temperate shores of eastern
North America, the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea, and the tropical
and temperate shores of eastern South America. It contains about
1,200 species.
 Eastern Atlantic: Tropical species of fish are limited to the Gulf of Guinea,
a small area along the western coast of Africa. This region contains only
about 500 species of tropical shore fishes.
47
Chapter 3: Choosing the Best Fish for You

Finding Good Choices
When your tank is fully established, the water chemistry is balanced (see
Chapters 12 and 13), and you’re ready to stock your aquarium, I thoroughly
recommend that you have a game plan in mind. Don’t blindly go to your
pet dealer and look for fish for your tank because that can result in fish
incompatibility.
Instead, preselect the kind of fish you want to start with, keeping in mind my
suggestions in this section. (Also consult with some of the fish encyclopedias
listed in Appendix A.) In other words, establish a good list of potential fish
that you want to introduce into your aquarium. Remember to choose a vari-
ety of species that will live throughout the water column, from the top to the
bottom.
This section gives you a list of tropical marine species that are relatively easy
to care for. They are well suited for the beginner’s peaceful tank where pH
ranges from 8.1 to 8.3 and temperature is maintained between 75°F and 
79°F. I’ve listed both the common and scientific names and tried to include
common representatives of each of the families reviewed in Chapter 2.
Bear in mind that common names vary from place to place, book to book,
and store to store, but scientific names don’t. In the following sections, I’ve
listed the most common of the common names, if that makes any sense.
Also included is information on the level of the tank that the fish is most
likely to inhabit, where it comes from, and its feeding preference. The size
that I have listed for each fish is that usually attained in the home aquarium,
which may be less than in the wild. In addition, for some species I’ve
included close relatives that are similar and equally suited for the aquarium.
Bear in mind that every aquarium book has specific recommendations for fish
that vary among authors. There are literally thousands of fish species kept by
aquarium hobbyists, and no one author has a perfect list. The following sec-
tions include the species that I prefer, but others may be equally suitable.
Surgeonfishes and tangs (Acanthuridae)
The common names surgeonfish and tang both refer to members of this
family, but these fishes have more in common than doctors and breakfast
drinks. The family is typically called the surgeonfishes, but acanthurids are
also called tangs, doctorfish, and unicornfish.
48
Part I: Getting to Know Your Fish and Invertebrates 

Yellow tang (Zebrasoma flavescens)
The yellow tang is one of the most colorful, common, and recognizable
species in the aquarium industry. It is ideal for the beginner. The yellow tang
eats a variety of foods, preferring a vegetarian diet. It is safe with all fishes
and is best kept as a single specimen.
 Distribution: Central and South Pacific
 Size: 7 inches
 Food: Herbivorous
 Tank level: All levels
Lipstick tang or orange-spine unicornfish (Naso lituratus)
This species is another peaceful tang that’s an attractive addition to a larger
aquarium. The common name refers to the well-defined facial markings and
red around the mouth of this fish. Remember that tangs and surgeons have
two scalpels on each side of the tail, so care must be taken when handling
these fish. Although the lipstick tang and other tangs are listed as herbivo-
rous, they can be acclimated to other protein foods and flake foods.
 Distribution: Indo-West Pacific
 Size: 8 inches
 Food: Herbivorous
 Tank level: All levels
Regal or hippo tang (Paracanthurus hepatus)
The deep royal blue body and bright yellow tail of this tang are distinctive
and have made this fish a popular aquarium choice. Unfortunately, some of
this coloring is lost as the fish gets older. Although some feel that the regal
can be kept with members of the same species, it is best to limit your tank to
one unless you have a very large tank. These vegetarians will also accept
brine shrimp most of the time. Be aware that this species is very susceptible
to marine ich (see Chapter 19).
 Distribution: Indo-West Pacific 
 Size: 6 inches
 Food: Herbivorous
 Tank level: All levels
49
Chapter 3: Choosing the Best Fish for You

Cardinalfishes (Apogonidae)
If you’re looking for a calm, cool, and collected species of fish that blends
with other mellow species and many invertebrates, keep your eyes open for
a cardinalfish. This critter is the Ghandi of fish.
Flamefish (Apogon maculatus)
The flamefish is one of the tranquil cardinalfishes that’s well suited for the
aquarium of the beginner. This fish has striking red coloration, prefers a
peaceful aquarium, and takes all kinds of aquarium foods provided they will
fit into its mouth. Because cardinalfishes are nocturnal by nature, they may
be a bit shy at first. Feed these fish in the evening.
 Distribution: Western Atlantic
 Size: 3 inches
 Food: Omnivorous 
 Tank level: Middle and lower levels
Pajama cardinalfish (Sphaeramia nematoptera)
This species of cardinalfish is wearing those pajamas that my father refuses
to throw out. It has three distinct color patterns on its body, each completely
different. Like other cardinalfishes, the pajama has large eyes for nocturnal
feeding and can be kept in groups. Care must be taken not to introduce bois-
terous fishes with cardinalfish because doing so will disrupt their quiet
lifestyle. Cardinalfishes are ideal for the invertebrate reef tank.

Triggerfishes (Balistidae)
Although there are many species of triggerfishes available to the aquarist,
most are not suitable for reef tanks. This is simply because many trigger-
fishes love invertebrates . . . for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
The Niger trigger fish (Odonus niger), also called the redtooth trigger is a
common relatively peaceful member of this family. They are compatible in
fish only and reef aquaria. They may be shy initially but become more social
with time.

Blennies (Blenniidae)
The lovely little blennies are the all-around nice guys of the peaceful aquar-
ium. They’re cute, intelligent, and fun to hang with. Everybody wants to know
the blenny.
Midas or Persian blenny (Ecsenius midas)
Like most blennies, this fish needs plenty of nooks and caves to hide in. After
they’re acclimated, the midas blenny is quite animated, perching itself on
rocks to observe the rest of the aquarium. This yellow-hued fish swims like
an eel, and its healthy appetite for all types of food makes it an ideal begin-
ner’s fish for the fish-only and reef tank.
 Distribution: Indian Ocean, Red Sea

 Food: Omnivorous 
 Tank level: Lower level
Bicolor blenny (Ecsenius bicolor) 
This blenny has a front (anterior) half that is brown and a rear (posterior) half
that is orange, hence the name. The bicolor is a shy species of fish that lives
in small holes and caves. It is a pleasure to watch. When feeding, it darts from
its home to catch food and quickly returns to the safety of its den by backing
in. Like the midas blenny, the bicolor will readily accept a variety of foods
and is compatible with invertebrates.

Butterflyfishes (Chaetodontidae)
The butterflyfishes in general are not suitable for the inexperienced aquarist
because they can be difficult to maintain. However, a couple of species are
popular in the aquarium trade and can fare quite well if water quality is prop-
erly maintained.
Threadfin butterflyfish (Chaetodon auriga)
The threadfin butterflyfish is named for the threadlike extension that devel-
ops on the dorsal fin of the adult. It will consume a variety of aquarium foods
and particularly enjoys live brine shrimp. Similar species include vagabond
butterflyfish (C. vagabundus), Klein’s butterflyfish (C. kleinii), and raccoon
butterflyfish (C. lunula).
 Distribution: Indo-West Pacific, Red Sea
 Size: 4 inches
 Food: Omnivorous
 Tank level: Middle and lower levels
Wimplefish or pennant coralfish (Heniochus acuminatus)
This peaceful butterflyfish is easy to keep, easy to feed, and may be kept in
groups of two or three if your aquarium is large enough. The front rays of the
dorsal fin on the wimplefish are extended and grow with age. The wimplefish
is often called the Heniochus butterflyfish, longfin bannerfish, or poor man’s
moorish idol. Young of this species have been known to act as cleaner fish
(see Chapter 2). Similar species include the schooling bannerfish (Heniochus
diphreutes).
 Distribution: Indo-West Pacific, Red Sea
 Size: 6 inches
 Food: Omnivorous
 Tank level: Middle and lower levels
Gobies (Gobiidae) 
The gobies remind me of the blennies, except their heads are little bigger.
They, too, are animated, which makes them fun to watch. These are the
proverbial worker bees of the fish world, cleaning the substrate, the rocks,
and even the other fishes.

Lemon goby (Gobiodon citrinus)
The lemon goby typically spends much of its time perched on aquarium dec-
orations, quietly observing the rest of the tank. Its beautiful yellow coloration
with blue streaks is a nice addition to any tank. This peaceful fish shouldn’t
be kept with large fishes because of its size, but it does well in a reef tank.
After it’s settled, the lemon goby will accept most foods and has a particular
fondness for live brine shrimp.
 Distribution: Indo-West Pacific
 Size: 11⁄2 inches
 Food: Carnivorous
 Tank Level: Lower level
Neon goby (Elacatinus oceanops)
The neon goby is a popular fish both in the wild and in the aquarium. It is
well known for the cleaning services (removing parasites) that it offers to
other fish. Although it tends to fight with other neon gobies, this critter is
one of the few marine aquarium fishes that breeds in captivity. Unfortunately,
it is short-lived, lasting only between one and two years in the average 
aquarium.
 Distribution: Western Atlantic, Caribbean Sea
 Size: 2 inches
 Food: Omnivorous
 Tank level: Lower level
Randall’s shrimp goby (Amblyeleotris randalli)
This colorful goby readily accepts a variety of meaty foods, including brine
and frozen shrimp. Like many gobies, it likes to dig into the substrate, so a
sandy bottom is required. Randall’s shrimp goby makes a nice addition 
to a reef tank. Similar species include the orange-spotted shrimp goby
(Amblyeleotris guttata).

Chapter 3: Choosing the Best Fish for You

Wrasses (Labridae)
Many of the wrasses grow quite large, something to take into account before
you purchase one. In general, juveniles are peaceful, hardy fish that accept a
variety of marine foods, but they do grow up, so be careful.
Spanish hogfish (Bodianus rufus)
Hogfish are colorful wrasses with a funny name. Young Spanish hogfish are
known to clean other fish. As the fish matures, depending on the locality of
capture, the coloration changes and red becomes more predominant. Larger
hogfish will make a meal of smaller aquarium inhabitants, so you may need to
remove them when they grow too large. In other words, you may need to kick
some wrasse (out of the tank). Similar species include the Cuban or spotfin
hogfish (Bodianus pulchellus).
 Distribution: Western Atlantic
 Size: 8 inches
 Food: Omnivorous
 Tank level: All levels
African clown wrasse or queen coris (Coris formosa)
This wrasse also changes colors as it matures, with its white stripes changing
to blue-green. The African clown wrasse is a bottomfeeder that prefers live
marine invertebrates, such as brine shrimp, as well as other meaty foods.
Keep this wrasse as a single specimen in your tank, because there is a ten-
dency for these fish to quarrel among themselves. The African clown wrasse
is generally safe with small fishes while a juvenile but may become more aggres-
sive as it ages. This and other wrasses aren’t well suited for the reef tank.
Similar species include the clown wrasse or yellowtail coris (Coris gaimard).
 Distribution: Indo-West Pacific, Red Sea
 Size: 8 inches
 Food: Carnivorous
 Tank level: Lower level
Bluestreak cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus)
The cleaner wrasse is a popular fish in the marine aquarium. As the name
implies, this fish is indispensable at feeding on the parasites of other tank
inhabitants, working around the body, gills, and mouth of its client. It not
only provides a useful service for the tank but also feeds in a natural manner.
54
Part I: Getting to Know Your Fish and Invertebrates 

Meaty marine foods can augment the fish’s diet. More than one cleaner can
be kept in the same tank, as well. Similar species include the Hawaiian
cleaner wrasse (Labroides phthirophagus).
 Distribution: Indo-West Pacific
 Size: 2 inches
 Food: Carnivorous
 Tank level: All levels
Canary wrasse (Halichoeres chrysus)
With its bright yellow body and characteristic black spots, this wrasse is a
beautiful addition to the beginner’s aquarium. It’s a hardy, peaceful fish that
readily accepts a variety of frozen and live marine foods.
 Distribution: Indian Ocean
 Size: 4 inches
 Food: Carnivorous
 Tank level: All levels
Angelfishes (Pomacanthidae)
Angelfishes can grow large and have a tendency to become aggressive and
territorial as they get older. Unless you plan on keeping large, boisterous
fishes in a high-capacity aquarium, the dwarf angelfishes of the genus
Centropyge are the right angelfish for the beginner. Specifically, this group
includes the African pygmy or orangeback angelfish (C. acanthops), the coral
beauty (C. bispinosa), the lemonpeel angelfish (C. flavissima), Herald’s or
yellow angelfish (C. heraldi), the flame angelfish (C. loricula), and the cherub
angelfish (C. argi). Unlike the larger species of angel, many of these angels
associate in pairs and can be kept with members of the same species.
These fishes enjoy a variety of marine foods. An added advantage of these
angelfish is that they are compatible with many marine invertebrates, should
you decide to establish a reef tank. Provide many aquarium decorations in
which these species can seek refuge.

Damselfishes (Pomocentridae) 
The damselfishes, or damsels for short, comprise a charismatic group of
aquarium fishes. This bunch has a lot of personality — in some cases, too
much. Damsels can be like party guests that don’t know that the party ended
two hours ago, but some can be nice.
Common clownfish (Amphiprion ocellaris)
The common clownfish is the most popular anemonefish in the aquarium
trade. Clownfish are one of the few species reared in captivity, so it is best to
find a tank-reared Nemo because wild-caught specimens are pretty hard to
keep alive. This species doesn’t live well when alone and should be main-
tained in pairs. It will readily accept a variety of finely chopped frozen foods
and can be coaxed into accepting flake. Clownfish are adapted to living
with an anemone (see Chapter 2), so they are well suited for the reef tank.
The anemone is not mandatory, though, so clownfish can be kept in the fish-
only community tank, as well. A similar species is the orange clownfish
(Amphiprion percula).
 Distribution: Indo-West Pacific
 Size: 2 inches
 Food: Omnivorous
 Tank level: Middle and lower levels
Clark’s anemonefish (Amphiprion clarkii)
These hardy, peaceful community fish live happily without an anemone,
but more than one may not get along. Its coloration can vary according
to locality of capture, and it will eat a variety of foods including flake, live
foods, and green foods. Similar species include the tomato clownfish
(Amphiprion frenatus).
 Distribution: Indo-West Pacific
 Size: 3 inches
 Food: Omnivorous
 Tank level: Middle and lower levels
Sergeant major (Abudefduf saxatilis)
This damselfish is named after its black and yellow banding pattern that
looks like military epaulettes. This is an active shoaling species that can be
kept in groups. The sergeant major is considered an ideal marine tropical for
56
Part I: Getting to Know Your Fish and Invertebrates 

the beginner because it is hardy and accepts a wide variety of marine foods.
In addition, the sergeant major is less territorial and pugnacious than other
damsels. Other damsels, including the blue damselfish (Chrysiptera cyanea),
the humbud damselfish (Dascyllus aruanus), the yellowtail damselfish
(Microspathodon chrysurus), and beaugregory (Stegastes leucostictus), are
also considered fine fish for the beginner because they are extremely hardy
and easy to feed. However, these fish can be quite territorial and may create
problems for the other fishes in your tank.
 Distribution: Indo-West Pacific, western Atlantic
 Size: 2 inches
 Food: Omnivorous
 Tank level: All levels
Blue green chromis (Chromis viridis)
This is another peaceful, colorful damselfish that can be kept in a group.
The green chromis is an active fish that may be finicky at the start but will
consume a variety of chopped meaty foods after it has acclimated to the
aquarium. Its bright coloration looks like blue-tinted green chrome, hence
the name.
 Distribution: Indo-West Pacific, Red Sea
 Size: 2 inches
 Food: Omnivorous
 Tank level: Middle levels
Sweetlips (Haemulidae)
In general, the sweetlips are hardy but shy fishes that feed on meaty marine
foods. The colors on the yellow sweetlips (Plectorhinchus albovittatus) change
with age, as well, and they become drabber with size. The beautiful yellow
stripes of the yellow sweetlips fade, and the fish becomes browner as its gets
larger. This species can be reclusive if kept with boisterous tank mates, but
it’s ideal for a peaceful fish-only or reef tank.

Dottybacks (Pseudochromidae) 
The strawberry gramma (Pseudochromis porphyreus) is a brilliant purple 
dottyback that’s easy to feed and hardy in captivity. Like many dottybacks,
however, it can be aggressive toward similar species or similar-looking
species. Therefore, it is best kept singly. It will accept most marine frozen,
live, and flake foods. Similar species include the flash-back gramma
(Pseudochromis diadema).
 Distribution: Indo-West Pacific
 Size: 2 inches
 Food: Omnivorous 
 Tank level: Lower levels
Sea basses (Serranidae)
Belonging to the family of sea basses, the wreckfish or sea goldie (Pseudanthias
squamipinnis) is unlike many of its relatives in that it is a schooling species
that doesn’t become overly large and predatory. It can be kept in groups and
adapts well to a peaceful fish-only tank. The wreckfish is carnivorous, so it
requires live or meaty foods. These colorful fish are an attractive addition to
the aquarium that can also be kept with invertebrates.
 Distribution: Indo-West Pacific
 Size: 4 inches
 Food: Carnivorous 
 Tank level: All levels
Rabbitfishes (Siganidae) 
The foxface (Siganus vulpinus) is the most common rabbitfish kept in captiv-
ity. It is sometimes called the badgerfish because of its facial markings, which
highly contrast its bright yellow body. This fish is an algae eater, so an aquar-
ium with lush algal growth is preferred. It will, however, accept a variety of
foods as long as vegetable matter is presented. The foxface can be aggressive
toward its own kind, so it should be kept singly.

Pufferfishes (Tetraodontidae) 
The spotted sharpnose pufferfish (Canthigaster solandri) is the smallest and
most beautiful of the common pufferfishes. This species differs from the
others in that it’s a small fish that will not outgrow the tank. It is a peaceful
fish that should be kept away from its own kind and will accept a variety of
finely chopped seafood. It is not recommended for the reef tank.

Identifying the Wrong 
Fish for the Beginner
Many species of fish aren’t well suited for the beginner’s aquarium for a
number of reasons.
 Some may be highly sensitive to fluctuating water quality conditions
characteristic of the new aquarium.
 Others may have special needs, like special water or lighting conditions.
The beginner should not try to provide this type of habitat without
acquiring some experience.
 A number of species aren’t socially compatible with the peaceful tank.
This group includes large carnivorous fish that eat smaller fish, territor-
ial fish that don’t tolerate trespassing, and mature fish that display
aggression and combative behavior.
 Some species of marine fishes exude poison when threatened. In a
closed aquarium, this can have deadly consequences.
59
Chapter 3: Choosing the Best Fish for You

At times, aggressive species may be offered by the pet store and even pro-
moted by pet dealers because the fish are smaller juveniles that may be 
considered harmless. Don’t be fooled by this argument: Large predatory fish
generally grow fast and develop aggressive behavior early in life. Also, don’t
be convinced to buy fish without doing a little homework. You may end up
with a pet that requires special aquarium conditions. Oh, it may live for days
or weeks in your tank, but chronic stress will set in, its immune response will
fail, and the fish will ultimately die due to disease.
Don’t rush into a purchase. As you develop your talents as an aquarist, you
will expand your capabilities and be able to keep some of the more sensitive
species of fish. You may even want to establish an aquarium of compatible
aggressive species. However, at this stage of your aquarium-keeping career,
concentrate on maintaining water quality with a few compatible and rugged
species of fish.
The following sections list those species that you should avoid in your tropi-
cal marine aquarium when you’re first getting started. These fish are those
that you’re most likely to encounter in the aquarium store. I’ve included
some basic reasons why these fish are not suitable for the beginner.
Surgeons and tangs (Acanthuridae)
Sometimes it’s best not to have a surgeon in the house. Or a tang. Although
not a lot of surgeonfishes are available to the average aquarist, your dealer
may carry the following tangs that are difficult to keep.
 Achilles tang (Acanthurus achilles): Delicate; not compatible
 Powder blue tang (Acanthurus leucosternons): Aggressive; prone to
marine ich
 Powder brown surgeonfish (Acanthurus japonicus): Delicate; finicky
eater
Triggerfishes (Balistidae)
Many species of triggerfishes are beautiful and fun to watch, but don’t let that
fool you. They can be predatory and aggressive, and nobody needs a hairpin
triggerfish in their aquarium. Remember, they eat invertebrates!
60
Part I: Getting to Know Your Fish and Invertebrates 

 Undulate triggerfish (Balistapus undulatus): Large; very aggressive
 White-lined or boomerang triggerfish (Sufflamen bursa): Aggressive
 Queen triggerfish (Balistes vetula): Large predator; aggressive
 Clown triggerfish (Balistoides conspicillum): Large predator; aggressive
Blennies (Blenniidae)
The Blenniidae may be a peaceful family, but every family has a few bad
seeds. These bad seeds shouldn’t be planted in your tank;
 False cleanerfish (Aspidontus taeniatus): Predatory fish biter
 Redlip blenny (Ophioblennius atlanticus): Territorial; harasses
other fish
Butterflyfishes (Chaetodontidae)
Believe me, many new aquarists want to include butterflyfish in their aquar-
ium. They are simply too beautiful to resist. But their beauty is a two-edged
sword because they are also delicate and difficult to feed. What follows are a
few examples. As you become a seasoned veteran of aquarium-keeping, but-
terflyfishes will become part of your pet repertoire.
 Yellow long-nosed butterflyfish (Forcipiger flavissimus): Delicate;
needs very high water quality
 Red tailed butterflyfish (Chaetodon collare): Difficult to feed
 Saddleback butterflyfish (Chaetodon ephippium): Difficult to feed;
incompatible with others
 Banded butterflyfish (Chaetodon striatus): Delicate; incompatible
 Copperband butterflyfish (Chelmon rostratus): Delicate; difficult to
feed; needs very high water quality
 Four-eyed butterflyfish (Chaetodon capistratus): Delicate
 Red-headed or hooded butterflyfish (Chaetodon larvatus): Delicate
 Chevron butterflyfish (Chaetodon trifascialis): Delicate
61
Chapter 3: Choosing the Best Fish for You

Porcupinefishes (Diodontidae)
The porcupinefishes are oddities that many aquarists are drawn to. But these
fish outgrow their homes very quickly, and their predatory nature will quickly
disrupt your tank. Also, if you have a large one, and it gets spooked and
inflates — well, you get the picture.
 Spiny boxfish or striped burrefish (Chilomycterus schoepfii): Large;
predatory
 Long-spine porcupinefish (Diodon holacanthus): Large; predatory
 Common porcupinefish (Diodon hystrix): Large; messy eater
Fairy basslets (Grammatidae)
One would think that with a name like fairy basslet, this fish is ideal for the
new aquarium. Not really. Put away those images of Cinderella and wait until
you have a little more experience before buying one of these critters.
 Black-cap gramma (Gramma melacara): Highly territorial
Squirrelfishes (Holocentridae)
Although an attractive fish, the common squirrelfish (Holocentrus adscensio-
nis) is predatory and boisterous and will quickly outgrow your aquarium.
Wrasses (Labridae)
Although many species of wrasses are very attractive, some can be disrup-
tive to a peaceful tank, aggressive toward smaller fishes, or too large for the
average aquarium.
 Dwarf parrot wrasse (Cirrhilabrus rubriventralis): Delicate
 Twin-spot wrasse or clown coris (Coris aygula): Grows too large
 Birdmouth wrasse (Gomphosus caeruleus): Boisterous
 Harlequin tuskfish (Choerodon fasciatus): Large; predatory
 Moon wrasse (Thalassoma lunare): Boisterous; large; aggressive
62

Snappers (Lutjanidae)
Like many of its fellow family members, the emperor snapper (Lutjanus sebae)
grows too large for the average home aquarium.
Filefish (Monocanthidae)
The long-nose filefish (Oxymonacanthus longirostris) is a delicate fish.
Moray eels (Muraenidae)
It’s a simple fact that moray eels are cool. One of my first fishes was a moray eel.
Huge mistake! These snakes of the sea grow large and eat fish. Enough said.
 Snowflake moray (Echidna nebulosa): Large; predatory
 Reticulated moray (Gymnothorax favagineus): Large; predatory
Boxfishes (Ostraciidae)
This group includes the spotted boxfish (Ostracion meleagris), which is delicate
and secretes poison. Living in poisonous water tends to make life difficult for
other critters in the aquarium.
Angelfishes (Pomacanthidae)
Like the butterflyfishes, the angels are delicate, beautiful, and attractive to
the new aquarist. Many species are offered by your dealer, but allow your
aquarium-keeping talents to develop before you become the guardian of an
angelfish.
 Three-spot angelfish (Apolemichthys trimaculatus): Delicate; territor-
ial; difficult to acclimate
 Purple moon or Arabian angelfish (Pomacanthus asfur): Aggressive;
territorial
 Bicolor angelfish (Centropyge bicolor): Delicate
63
Chapter 3: Choosing the Best Fish for You

 Blue-faced angelfish (Pomacanthus xanthometopon): Delicate
 Queen angelfish (Holacanthus ciliaris): Aggressive; territorial;
grows large
 King angelfish (Holacanthus passer): Very aggressive; grows large
 Rock beauty (Holacanthus tricolor): Very aggressive; finicky
 French angelfish (Pomacanthus paru): Nippy when young; grows large
 Koran angelfish (Pomacanthus semicirculatus): Grows large; territorial
 Regal or royal angelfish (Pygoplites diacanthus): Delicate; shy; diffi-
cult to acclimate
Damselfishes (Pomacentridae)
Although it sounds funny, on more than one occasion I’ve been nipped by
a damsel while diving in the tropics. That’s because these little bullies are 
territorial and the size of the intruder does not matter when it comes to
defending their turf.
 Blue devil (Pomacentrus caeruleus): Aggressive
 Dascyllus species: Territorial; aggressive
Dottybacks (Pseudochromidae)
Like many dottybacks, the false gramma or royal dottyback (Pseudochromis
paccagnellae) can be aggressive.
Lionfishes (Scorpaenidae)
When you’re tired of looking at all those beautiful small fish in your aquar-
ium, introduce a lionfish and the balance of power will quickly shift. You will
then have an aquarium with only one fish. Oh, another neat feature of this
critter: It has venomous spines. Get the point?
 Shortfin turkeyfish (Dendrochirus brachypterus): Predatory; 
poisonous
 Lionfish (Pterois species): Predatory; poisonous
64

Sea basses (Serranidae)
If you want to keep a pet that you will eventually fillet and serve for dinner,
buy one of these basses and groupers. Simply stated, they grow big and they
do so by eating small fish.
 Coral trout (Cephalopholis miniata): Large; predatory
 Golden-stripe grouper or six-stripe soapfish (Grammistes sexlineatus):
Large; predatory
Seahorses and pipefish (Syngnathidae)
There is no doubt about it, the seahorses and their cousins, the pipefishes,
are beautiful and graceful. But please don’t run out and stock your new tank
with them. These fishes belong in a specialty aquarium where their special
needs can be tended to.
 Banded pipefish (Doryrhamphus dactyliophorus): Delicate
 Lined seahorse (Hippocampus erectus): Delicate
 Yellow or spotted seahorse (Hippocampus kuda): Delicate
Pufferfishes (Tetraodontidae)
The white-spotted puffer (Arothron meleagris) is a large, messy eater.

 Recognizing invertebrates: from sponges to cucumbers
I
n Chapter 2, I discuss only the smallest portion of what makes up a natural
coral reef: the fishes. Even though the number of fish species is in the
thousands, that’s nothing compared to the number of invertebrates. Did you
know that biologists have described over a million species of animals, but
only about 5 percent are vertebrates? The others are all invertebrates.
Though many invertebrates live in the ocean, only a few, discussed in this
chapter, are available to the marine aquarist.
In Chapter 1, I discuss living reef tanks and invertebrate tanks. Here’s a quick
overview: Aquariums with invertebrates are becoming more and more
common because of better filtration systems, more sophisticated technology,
and the wider availability of healthy invertebrate species. Invertebrates require
special lighting and water of high quality. In Chapters 7 and 8, I discuss this
equipment as it pertains to invertebrate tanks. In this chapter, I describe exactly
what an invertebrate is and highlight species that are typically available to
the home aquarist.
Inside Invertebrates
As the name implies, invertebrates are animals that are not vertebrates.
The single unifying feature of invertebrates is that they lack a backbone.
However, while animals with a backbone are all lumped into the phylum
Chordata, the invertebrates are so diverse that they comprise many different
phyla. For example, insects are invertebrates and snails are invertebrates,
as are jellyfish. But you know by looking at these critters that they are not
closely related, except for the fact that they are invertebrates.

It’s difficult to describe the typical invertebrate because of the great diversity
among the groups. However, in general, invertebrates do have special needs
when compared to fishes. (In Chapter 1, I discuss these needs in more detail.)
These animals are extremely sensitive to water quality, so advanced filtration
systems are required. Other equipment, including protein skimmers and spe-
cialized lighting, are also essential. Chapter 7 helps you understand why a
protein skimmer is important, but why would invertebrates need more light?
Some invertebrates, like corals and anemones, have tiny algae in their bodies
that capture light the way that plants do and provide energy for their hosts.
Without intense light, these organisms and their hosts die. Some invertebrate
species also require elevated water temperatures of 80°F to 84°F, so this must
be kept in mind.
So the bottom line is that if you’re going to keep invertebrates, make sure
that you have the right equipment, discussed in Part II of this book.
Recognizing Common Aquarium
Invertebrates
In the following sections, I’ve arranged common invertebrates, starting with
the most primitive and ending with the most complex.
68
Part I: Getting to Know Your Fish and Invertebrates 
Spineless classification
Like all living creatures, invertebrates are clas-
sified into species. Similar species are grouped
into families, similar families into orders, similar
orders into classes, and classes into phyla.
With so many families of invertebrates, I could
write several textbooks to cover all of them. In
fact, each phylum of the invertebrates would
require a textbook or two of its own. For our pur-
poses, it isn’t necessary to cover all inverte-
brate phyla. Instead, I simply tell you about
those that are available to the typical marine
aquarium. Individual species will vary with
availability, so I highlight the most common.

Phylum Porifera
Members of the phylum Porifera are commonly known to us as sponges. The
sponges are the most primitive of the multicellular organisms, lacking true
tissues and organs. The fact that these critters don’t even have a mouth led
many early biologists to think they were plants.
The sponge in your kitchen sink is synthetic. However, for centuries, the
sponges used by man were the porous skeletons of animals harvested
from the ocean and, in some parts of the world, they still are. Most of the
5,000 species of sponges are marine, found wherever there are rocks, shells,
or coral to provide a suitable place for attachment.
The bodies of sponges are organized into a system of water canals and cham-
bers lined with hairs, called flagella, that move to create the flow of seawater
through the sponge. Feeding, gas exchange, and waste removal are depen-
dent on this flow. Hence, sponges are filters.
More important to the aquarist, sponges are rarely drab colored. They 
typically exhibit bright colors of green, yellow, red, orange, or purple. They
also come in a variety of interesting shapes, ranging from flat to heavily
branched.
If you decide to add sponges to your aquarium, realize that they require high
water quality and adequate flow that allows them to maintain healthy clean
open canals and chambers. Also try to keep them out of direct lighting, which
will enhance algal growth on their surfaces and literally choke them. Lastly,
never remove sponges from the water: This will kill them as air pockets form
inside.
A sponge that dies after being inadequately maintained can cause a signifi-
cant toxic reaction, perhaps wiping out everything in the tank. Know this
before considering them for your aquarium.
If you decide to maintain live rock in your aquarium, it’s likely to be popu-
lated by very small sponges, which stay alive by filtering material from the
water. Although larger aquarium varieties are available for purchase, many
are toxic or difficult to keep in captivity. Common species include blue finger
sponges (Haliclona spp.), orange ball sponges (Cinachyra spp.), and frilly
sponges (Callyspongia spp.).

Chapter 4: About Invertebrates

Phylum Cnidaria
This large group of invertebrates includes the jellyfish, hard and soft corals,
sea anemones, sea whips, and sea fans. When you impress your friends with
the funny name that these animals are called, make sure you don’t pronounce
the “c”: nie-DARE-ee-ah.
These critters are all united by their radial symmetry; that is, their bodies are
cylindrical. Unlike the sponges, cnidarians have a digestive cavity and a
mouth surrounded by a circle of tentacles with stinging capsules, which
aid in the capture and ingestion of food. These stinging capsules, called
nematocysts, are a common feature of all cnidarians.
This phylum is composed of about 9,000 species and, with few exceptions,
they are marine. Some cnidarians, like jellyfish, are free swimming, but most
are sessile; that is, attached to the bottom.
Of all the invertebrates suited for the marine aquarium, cnidarians are the
most popular. However, they are also the most delicate, requiring high water
quality, optimal bright lighting conditions, and rigorous water flow.
There are three classes of cnidarians:
 The Hydrozoa includes the hydras and hydroids.
 The Scyphozoa are what people commonly call jellyfish. 
 The Anthozoa comprise the soft and hard corals, sea anemones, and
sea fans.
Because this is an aquarium book and not an invertebrate biology book, I
don’t discuss the hydras and jellyfish in great detail because you’re not
likely to find them at the typical aquarium dealership. However, this doesn’t
mean that you won’t have them in your aquarium, because the tiny stalked
hydroids, which look like little plants, can be found on live rock with dozens
of other invertebrate species.
On the other hand, the Anthozoans are the most popular invertebrates, and I
want to highlight the groups that comprise this class.
Sea anemones
Pronounced “ah-NEM-o-nee,” these beautiful tank additions of the order
Actiniaria are common in the marine aquarium. My first anemone was pur-
chased to house my first clownfish, which seek refuge in a sea anemone’s
70
Part I: Getting to Know Your Fish and Invertebrates 

stinging tentacles. The sea anemone is one of the few invertebrates that may
make its way into the fish-only tank for that sole purpose.
A sea anemone is a solitary animal known as a polyp. It differs from corals,
which consist of a number of polyps connected together to form a colony.
Sea anemones are often brightly colored as white, green, orange, red, or com-
binations of these colors, which can be spectacular. They inhabit coastal
waters throughout the world, living attached to rocks, shells, or other bottom
features.
The body of the anemone consists of a column with a pedal disk that
attaches to the substrate at one end and an oral disk with a slit-like mouth
for feeding at the other. The latter is surrounded by one or more rows of ten-
tacles, which vary greatly in size and number. The tentacles bear stinging
cells that are used to stun prey and draw them to the mouth. Clownfish,
Amphiprion species, are able to live among the tentacles of the sea anemone
because something on their skin prevents the nematocysts from stinging.
Other animals that are able to live on the anemone include cleaning shrimps,
snapping shrimps, arrow crabs, and brittle stars.
The reaction of people to these stinging tentacles ranges from nothing to
mild inflammation and depends on the species and the location of the sting,
so care must be taken when handling a sea anemone.
Like many forms of coral, some species of anemones house photosynthetic
algae called zooxanthellae and, therefore, require intense aquarium lighting.
Although seemingly immobile, the anemone can move about the aquarium
and will find a spot that provides protection and adequate lighting and 
current. 
Sea anemones (a Heteractis magnifica is shown in Figure 4-1) are capable of
retracting their tentacles and oral disk to rid their bodies of wastes. They will
also display this behavior when disturbed or under stress. Pay attention to
your anemone. If it remains retracted for an extended period of time, it may
be unhealthy, or the water quality in the tank may be poor.
Although anemones house algae that supply much of their nutritional
requirements, they should be fed regularly every couple of days with small
chunks of seafood, like fish, shrimps, clams, and scallops. Some aquarists
prefer to feed inexpensive freshwater fish, like goldfish, to anemones on a
regular basis. This practice should be discouraged because the fatty acid dis-
tribution in these fish is unlike that found in marine fish and can result in
nutritional problems in the anemone.
71
Chapter 4: About Invertebrates

Most sea anemones are captured in the wild and this is resulting in the com-
plete loss of wild populations in some areas. If you intend to house a sea
anemone, make an extra effort to obtain one that was bred in captivity or 
harvested in a sustainable way. Remember, you don’t need an anemone to
keep clownfishes healthy.
Common aquarium anemones include the following:
 Pink-tipped anemone (Condylactis gigantea): Also known as the
Caribbean giant anemone, this long-tentacled anemone is the most
common and inexpensive to keep. Its body is white, brown, or pink and
the tentacles are white or pink with an intense pink tip. Originating in
the tropical Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, the pink-tipped anemone
doesn’t typically house clownfish, which prefer Indo-Pacific anemones.
In the wild, this species grows to 6 inches high and 12 inches across.
 Clownfish host anemone (Entacmaea quadricolor): Also known as the
rose anemone, bubble tip anemone, and bulb anemone, this pink and
green species has swollen tips on its tentacles. As the name implies,
clownfish are readily attracted to this species.
Figure 4-1:

72
Part I: Getting to Know Your Fish and Invertebrates 

 Long-tentacled anemone (Macrodactyla doreensis): This is another
Indo-Pacific species that is readily accepted by clownfish. Its coloration
is typically red or pink with pink or purple-tipped tentacles. Also known
as the corkscrew anemone, this is an important species that may be over-
harvested in many areas, and not the most environment-friendly choice.
 Gelam and Malu anemones (Heteractis spp.): These closely related
species are actually quite different in appearance. Gelam anemones typi-
cally have shorter tentacles with swollen tips. For this reason, they are
also sometimes called bubble anemones. Their small size and vivid col-
oration make them nice additions to the aquarium. The Malu anemones,
which come from Indonesia, are ideal for the invertebrate aquarium
because they are readily available, attractive to clownfishes, and easy to
maintain. They are typically larger than the Gelam anemones and have
longer-tapered purple-tipped tentacles.
Long-term survival of many anemones in captivity is poor. Aquarists should
read up on their species of interest before making the commitment.
Polyps
Members of the order Zoanthidea are small anemone-like animals that are
sometimes referred to simply as polyps. These critters can be either solitary,
like the anemone, or colonial, like coral. They are typically small, short, and
button-like with a short fringe of tentacles surrounding a broad oral disk. 
Species of the genus Zoanthus are the most common in the aquarium trade.
These polyps are found in clusters and come in various shades of green and
brown. Like all invertebrates, they require high water quality and excellent
lighting, but they are easy to keep.
Mushroom anemones or polyps of the genera Discosoma and Rhodactis are
sort of a cross between anemones and corals. They are colonial but lack the
skeleton common to the corals. They, too, have photosynthetic algae and are
popular with marine aquarium hobbyists. They are typically flat with broad
oral disks. Coloration can be red, green, or brown with radiating stripes.
Periodic feedings to supplement their algae are recommended.
Stony corals
Moving your way through the class Anthozoa, you come to the close relatives
of the anemones, the animals of the order Scleractinia, called the stony or
hard corals. The foundation of diversity and beauty of the natural coral reef
community is the hard calcium carbonate skeleton of the coral animals.
73
Chapter 4: About Invertebrates

Like anemones, coral animals are polyps with a columnar body and tentacles.
However, individual coral polyps are connected to one another to form a
colony of animals. Unlike anemones, stony corals are not only colonial, but
they also produce a calcium carbonate skeleton. Individual coral polyps are
usually small, averaging one to three millimeters, but coral reef colonies can
become large, covering huge sections of the ocean floor.
Most people who are familiar with stony corals think of the hard skeleton
(called an exoskeleton) that is left behind when the animals die. In fact, the
shapes and structure of this skeleton are typically used to classify species.
Some corals are highly branched, while others resemble large boulders.
If you’re familiar only with dead coral and want to know what the live animal
looks like, imagine the coral skeleton covered with a fine layer of intercon-
nected tiny anemones.
As coral colonies grow in the wild and, as a result, reefs build up, the animals
add new layers of calcium carbonate exoskeleton on top of the old. To do so
requires calcium, which is readily available in the ocean. However, in the
closed system of the aquarium, stony corals can easily use up the calcium,
so you must add supplements (see Chapter 13).
Many species of corals have tiny photosynthetic dinoflagellate algae (see
Chapter 14) within them called zooxanthellae. These algae, which require
bright lighting and excellent water quality, provide the coral with much, but
not all, of their nutritional needs. Therefore, it is necessary to supplement the
coral every now and then, however, with microplankton and bits of seafood.
Also, many species of corals can extend their tentacles and are capable of
stinging and killing other corals, so keep corals separated.
Because it is illegal to harvest stony corals from the Caribbean, all of the
corals available to you originate in the tropical areas of the Indo-Pacific.
Stony corals require intense lighting, ideal water quality, and should only
be introduced into a mature aquarium system (one year or older).
The following are those that you will find easy to maintain and are most likely
to encounter:
 Staghorn and elkhorn corals (Acropora spp.): Corals of the genus
Acropora are so named because of their distinctive shapes. These are
relatively fast-growing stony corals that are heavily branched, ranging
in coloration from yellowish or purplish brown to cream colored with
paler tips. 
 Vase and frog spawn corals (Euphyllia spp.): This genus of coral has
pronounced tentacles that resemble those of sea anemones. Vase corals
have round tentacles, whereas those of frog spawn coral resemble a
mass of frog eggs.
74
Part I: Getting to Know Your Fish and Invertebrates 

 Brain corals (Leptoria, Favia, and Favites spp.): These stony corals are
familiar to most people because they are aptly named after that which they
resemble, the brain. These corals can be massive, but stick with smaller
specimens for your home aquarium. Coloration can vary depending on
species from shades of brown to vivid green to purple and pink.
 Plate corals (Fungia and Heliofungia spp.): These flat corals with long
tentacles are readily confused with anemones. Like anemones, some
species are solitary animals that are mobile, moving about the aquar-
ium. These species fend well when placed directly on the substrate,
where lighting is good and flow is moderate. The tentacles of these
corals make them easy to feed.
 Bubble corals (Plerogyra spp.): This genus is aptly named after the
bubble-like sacs that cover the mouths and tentacles of the colony.
These tan or pearl-colored corals are loaded with zooxanthellae algae
but should be fed pieces of seafood once a week.
 Sun corals (Tubestrea spp.): This vivid orange genus of coral, shown in
Figure 4-2, is a beautiful addition to the marine aquarium, although it may
be more difficult to maintain. Unlike other species of corals, sun corals
don’t possess photosynthetic algae and must rely on trapping food with
their tentacles. Therefore, you must regularly feed these corals and typi-
cally have to tease them with seafood juice to get the polyps to open for
feeding. After they’re well acclimated, sun corals will readily accept
small pieces of seafood neatly tucked into their tentacles. Sun corals
are really only recommended for aquarists with some experience.

Chapter 4: About Invertebrates

Soft corals
Not all corals have calcium carbonate skeletons. Those belonging to the
order Alcyonacea are called soft corals because they have a soft skeleton
comprised of calcareous spicules. These animals form soft fleshy or leathery
colonies that are irregularly shaped and quite large. The colonies of soft coral
can have finger-like projections, as well. Soft corals are generally more hardy
than their stony counterparts.
 Finger or colt corals (Alcyonium spp.): These tree-like branched soft
corals are easy to maintain in captivity and are ideally suited for a 
beginning invertebrate aquarist. Coloration is brown to soft white.
These fast-growing corals can be trimmed when they become 
overgrown.
 Leather or mushroom corals (Sarcophyton spp.): Widespread through-
out the Indo-Pacific, the leather corals are so named after their texture
and brown coloration (see Figure 4-3). Leather corals can be mushroom-
like in shape, but other forms can be finger-like, as well. The polyps of
these species are conspicuous when the animal is feeding, but retract
when disturbed. This is a hardy group of soft corals that grows rapidly
and is well suited for the beginner.
 Pulse or waving hand corals (Anthelia and Xenia spp.): So named after
the rhythmic pulsing of their polyps, the pulse corals appreciate a good
current in your aquarium. Pulse corals consist of a cluster of feathery or
branch-like polyps that join at the base like a tree trunk and anchor the
coral to the substrate. These corals are easy to keep, growing rapidly in
the marine aquarium of even the most inexperienced aquarist. However,
these corals are sensitive to rapid pH changes, so be careful when
adding aquarium buffers.
Sea fans and sea whips
Sometimes referred to as the horny corals, the sea fans and sea plumes
belong to the order Gorgonacea. The gorgonians differ from the stony and
soft corals by having a body that contains a central axial rod composed of an
inorganic substance called gorgonin. In addition, the living tissue has embed-
ded calcareous spicules of different shapes and colors of yellow, orange, or
lavender.
Like some other corals, gorgonians possess photosynthetic algae. These
colonial animals are flexible, swaying gently in the currents of your 
aquarium.
76
Part I: Getting to Know Your Fish and Invertebrates 

Gorgonians should be placed perpendicular to the flow. They can be anchored
in your aquarium with marine epoxy that’s designed for aquarium use.
 Sea fans (Gorgonia spp.): As the name implies, sea fans grow in a flat
plane that resembles a fan. Although their lacy appearance is attractive,
they require a strong current and can be difficult for the beginner to
maintain. Most species come from the Caribbean.
 Sea whips (Muricea spp.): The sea whips are similar to the sea fans, but
possess finger-like projections that extend in all directions. Like sea fans,
sea whips require plenty of circulation and may be best suited for the
advanced aquarist.
Phylum Platyhelminthes
Commonly referred to as flatworms, members of the phylum Platyhelminthes
are aptly named because they are flat. Although there are three major classes
of flatworms, only one, the Turbellaria, is not parasitic. Turbellarians range
Figure 4-3:
Soft corals
lack the
calcium
of their
cousins.
77
Chapter 4: About Invertebrates

in size from microscopic forms to species that are more than 2 feet long.
They are primarily aquatic, and most are marine bottom-dwellers that live
in sand and mud. Flatworms are considered the most primitive animals that
possess bilateral symmetry, that is, two sides that are identical.
Flatworms are not common in the aquarium trade, but some kinds may be
imported as hitchhikers on live rock. Only one species is occasionally offered
for sale, the red-rim flatworm (Pseudoceros splendidus).
Phylum Mollusca
The group of invertebrates called mollusks is one of the most familiar
because we like to eat them. Clams, oysters, scallops, mussels, squids, snails,
and octopuses all belong to this group and have been part of the human diet
for millennia. There are over 100,000 known living species of mollusks.
Mollusks are much more complex than the other invertebrates in the preceding
sections. Members of this group are united by several anatomical features.
The body consists of three regions: a head with sense organs, a mouth, and a
brain; a visceral mass containing most of the internal organs surrounded by a
body wall; and a foot, the muscular lower part of the body on which the animal
creeps. In addition, mollusks secrete a calcareous shell and possess a feeding
organ called a radula. In some mollusks, like snails, these parts are pretty obvi-
ous, but in others, like squids, some of these features are reduced or absent.
Some species of mollusks, like snails, adapt well to the marine aquarium, and
their scavenging habits make them easy to feed. However, many species of
mollusks are filter feeders. That is, they actually filter food particles and
small critters from the water when they feed. You probably already know that
your aquarium should be well filtered in order to maintain healthy animals,
so, you may have a problem with filter feeding critters. In general, the water
in your aquarium is too clean for them. Therefore, filter feeding invertebrates
are difficult to maintain in captivity, and I don’t recommend them for the
beginner.
There are seven classes of living mollusks, and the following are some of
those that are most suitable for the marine aquarium.
Snails
The class Gastropoda consists of over 75,000 species of mollusks that we call
snails. These critters live not only in fresh and salt water, but they have
adapted to life on land, as well. You probably remember finding slugs under
rocks in the garden. Snails, in general, have a shell and a muscular foot that
78
Part I: Getting to Know Your Fish and Invertebrates 

they use to move about. However, some species have lost their shells, like
the terrestrial slugs.
With so many different kinds of snails, it is difficult to single out a few species
for the marine aquarium. However, in general, snails are scavengers that will
consume algae, grazing it from the fixtures and glass. And that is a good
thing. Snails that graze on algae need a lot to remain healthy. Therefore, don’t
add more than a couple of snails to your aquarium – too many and they will
starve to death.
Some species of snails aren’t suitable for your aquarium because they grow
too large, like queen conches, or they are predatory of other invertebrates,
like whelks.
Many snails are available to the aquarist. Here are some examples:
 Cowries (Cypraea spp.): These gastropods have a highly polished
domed shell with decorative patterns, but the shell is often concealed
by a fleshy mantle that’s drab in coloration. Some feed on algae, a few
are omnivores, and some are predatory with feeding preferences toward
soft corals and other invertebrates. Read up on the particular species
you plan to obtain.
 Top or star snails (Astraea spp.): These snails have high conical shells
often lined with ridges. They are also excellent algae grazers and are
considered excellent additions to the reef aquarium.
 Nudibranchs (Aplysia and Chromodoris spp.): Sometimes called sea
slugs or sea hares, these are snails without shells (see Figure 4-4).
Although brightly colored, nudibranchs can be very difficult to maintain
in captivity because many are predatory and difficult to feed. In general,
avoid them.
Figure 4-4:

branch: It’s
interesting
but not
worth the

79
Chapter 4: About Invertebrates

Clams, scallops, mussels, and oysters
These animals belong to the class Bivalvia because their bodies are housed in
two shells that close like valves to protect them. There are about 15,000 species
of bivalves and more than 80 percent of them live in the sea.
These invertebrates are well adapted to burrowing in the substrate with
their wedge-like shape, but many species also live on top of the bottom.
Most bivalves are filter feeders, and they can be difficult to keep in the aver-
age aquarium. It is possible to purchase liquid food preparations that are
specifically designed for filter feeders, but this is best left to the experienced
aquarist.
Most species of clams, scallops, mussels, and oysters shouldn’t be kept by
the beginner because of their specialized feeding mode.
Nonetheless, the most common bivalve in the marine aquarium is the giant
clam of the genus Tridacna (see Figure 4-5). Although these species are
known to grow to over 200 pounds, smaller specimens are farm raised for the
aquarium trade. Despite what you may have heard, these clams don’t trap
people in their shells in an attempt to eat them. In fact, these clams harbor
photosynthetic algae that help sustain them (but they still need to be fed live
or cryogenically preserved phytoplankton). And they must be provided with
excellent lighting.
Figure 4-5:

Part I: Getting to Know Your Fish and Invertebrates 

Squids and octopuses
As I move through the phylum Mollusca, the complexity of the animals has
been increasing and the general body plan has been changing from the stan-
dard molluscan form. The squid and octopus belong to the class called
Cephalopoda, which is the most specialized and complex group of mollusks.
In fact, these critters are considered the most intelligent invertebrates.
Cephalopods have moved away from the substrate, and the body is adapted
to a mobile life in the water column. The head of cephalopods bears a crown
of arms and tentacles that they use for movement and feeding. In addition,
feeding is aided by the presence of a parrot-like beak, which is used to tear
apart and kill prey. Unlike their cousins the snails and bivalves, most
cephalopods have no hard external shell.
There are only about 650 living species of cephalopods, and they are among
the largest of the mollusks, ranging from just a couple of inches to over
40 feet in length.
It will be tempting to keep squids and octopuses in your new marine aquar-
ium because they are so beautiful and intriguing. But these invertebrates are
best left for advanced aquarists that are able to properly care for them.
Cephalopods are sensitive to water quality, they are expensive and highly
predatory, and they typically require their own space. I don’t recommend
them for a beginner.
Phylum Annelida
This group is commonly known as the segmented worms, which includes the
most popular worm on earth, the earthworm. But not all worms live on or in
dirt. In fact, of the 9,000 species of segmented worms, nearly two-thirds live
in the marine environment and belong to the class Polychaeta.
In general, segmented worms have a more advanced body plan than the mol-
lusks that I discuss in the “Phylum Mollusca” section of this chapter. As the
name implies, they all have an elongated body that’s segmented. In addition,
most annelids have well-developed circulatory, nervous, and excretory sys-
tems. Some forms have gills for respiration.
The marine polychaetes come in two forms: those that move about and those
that are sedentary, inhabiting tubes or burrows. The former worms can be
predators, grazers, or bottom-dwelling detritus feeders, whereas the seden-
tary forms typically have large gills and tentacles for filter feeding.
81
Chapter 4: About Invertebrates

Although these worms come in a variety of colors and sizes, not all are suit-
able for the typical aquarium. Some smaller forms may find their way into
your aquarium on live rock, but you will hardly know that they are there
scavenging marine detritus. The most common segmented worms kept in the
home aquarium are the sedentary tubeworms of the following species: 
 Fan or featherduster worms (Sebellastarte spp.): These sedentary
worms are imported from the Indo-Pacific for the aquarium trade.
They live in a parchment tube that’s buried in the substrate. The feathery
head is typically colorful and it is extended for feeding (see Figure 4-6).
When startled, the feathery tentacles are withdrawn within a fraction of
a second back into the safety of the tube. These invertebrates are not
particular about lighting and can be fed brine shrimp. Unfortunately,
these critters need a lot of planktonic food and tend to starve slowly in
the typical aquarium. If your fan worms lose their feathers, it can be a
sign that they aren’t being fed well enough.
 Christmas tree worms (Spirobranchus spp.): Like featherduster
worms, these creatures live in a tube, but the tube is calcareous and 
typically embedded in coral. In addition, these colorful worms with
heads of yellow, red, blue, or white have two sets of spiraling tentacles.
These plankton feeders are difficult to keep alive because they require a
regular supply of food. Like fan worms, they should only be kept by sea-
soned veterans.
Figure 4-6:
Fanworms

food.

Part I: Getting to Know Your Fish and Invertebrates 

Phylum Arthropoda
The phylum Arthropoda is by far the largest group of animals on the planet.
There are over one million species of arthropods, but over 900,000 of these
are insects, which I don’t include here (ants can’t swim).
Instead, I direct my attention to the class of marine insects called Crustacea.
This group comprises over 31,000 species and includes many familiar crea-
tures, like shrimps, crabs, and lobsters, that you encounter not only in the
aquarium but also in the kitchen.
Being arthropods, crustaceans have a hard encasement called an exoskeleton,
which provides protection. Like the annelids, arthropods are segmented with
joints in the exoskeleton that permit movement. It’s tough to grow with a hard
exoskeleton, so arthropods must periodically shed or molt their exoskeleton
to get bigger.
Unlike the annelids, the segments of arthropods are not alike, and the body
is divided into parts called the head, thorax, and abdomen. In the order
Decapoda, which includes the shrimps, crabs, and lobsters, the head and
thorax are fused to form the carapace.
The order Decapoda, which means ten feet, is named after the five pairs of
legs that these critters all have. Many species of crustaceans are scavengers,
but some can be predatory, as well. This means that not all crabs, shrimp,
and lobsters are right for the marine aquarium.
Crabs
The crabs are decapod crustaceans that are more flattened than the others,
have heavier legs and an abdomen or tail that’s folded under the body.
So, take a lobster and flatten it, shrink its tail, and fold it under the body,
and you have a crab.
Some crabs can be crabby, so it’s best to choose smaller species like the 
following:
 Horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus): This common species, shown
in Figure 4-7, is not a crustacean and actually belongs to its own class,
known as the Merostomata. I include it here because it is typically mar-
keted as a crab. Although this species grows to over 20 inches, smaller
specimens can be entertaining. Much of their time is spent half buried in
the bottom, and they can be fed small pieces of seafood. They require
deep sand beds and tend to do a lot of digging, so they aren’t suited for
beginning aquarists.
83
Chapter 4: About Invertebrates

 Arrow crab (Stenorhynchus seticornis): With its triangular head
and body and long legs, this odd-looking crab is a neat addition 
to any tank. The arrow crab is easily maintained and is a carnivore
that can be fed bits of seafood. They will also consume the noxious
bristleworm, which is good. Unfortunately, arrow crabs also eat tube-
worms and other small invertebrates, so take care when choosing tank
mates.
 Anemone crabs (Neopetrolisthes spp.): Clownfish are not the only 
critters that can make a home out of an anemone — so can the
anemone crab. This small (1 inch) crab will gladly accept any kind of
anemone. This genus has a number of species that come in a variety
of spotted color patterns. Although they will scavenge a bit, they
also rely heavily on filter feeding, which makes them difficult to keep
well fed.
 Hermit crabs: There are hermit crab genera from all over the world that
make nice additions to your aquarium. Unlike their cousins, hermit
crabs have a soft abdomen that’s protected by a snail shell that the crab
steals or finds uninhabited. They can be ideal scavengers in the aquar-
ium and excellent algae grazers. However, some species are large and
predatory, causing damage to the average invertebrate aquarium.
Take care when choosing a hermit crab for your tank. Smaller species,
like the blue-legged hermit (Clibanarius tricolor) and the scarlet hermit
(Paguristes cadenati), are preferred.
Figure 4-7:

84
Part I: Getting to Know Your Fish and Invertebrates 

Lobsters
In general, lobsters are not recommended additions to the invertebrate tank.
One is shown in Figure 4-8. They are boisterous, aggressive scavengers that
are well known for rearranging and disrupting the aquarium. They can be
predatory of other invertebrates and even fish, so they should be kept only
with larger fish.
Nonetheless, there are exceptions to this generalization, and the smaller
species of lobsters are less noxious.
 Purple spiny lobster (Panulirus versicolor): This is one of the spiny
lobsters, which means that it lacks large claws, but has two long anten-
nae. These colorful lobsters are fine for the aquarium when less than
5 inches long, but they become predatory when larger. Spiny lobsters
are efficient scavengers that readily feed on small pieces of seafood. 
 Flame lobsters (Enoplometopus spp.): Resembling a crayfish, this small
brightly colored lobster is typically less than 5 inches. It is less boisterous
and predatory than its cousins and will gladly accept most meaty seafoods.
Figure 4-8:

85
Chapter 4: About Invertebrates

Shrimps
The shrimps are the close cousins of the lobsters, without the attitude. They
are much smaller and more delicate than lobsters, as well, making them
attractive additions to the invertebrate and mixed species tank (Figure 4-9).
The following shrimp species are best for the beginner. Most come from the
Indo-Pacific, but some Caribbean species are also available. Shrimps are effi-
cient scavengers that feed on many aquarium foods. Take care to avoid
aggressive shrimp, such as mantis shrimp, which are predatory with power-
ful arms that can spear their prey.
 Cleaner shrimps (Lysmata spp.): These are by far the most popular
shrimps for the marine aquarium. As you can imagine, these critters are
named after their propensity to clean parasites and damaged skin from
many species of fish (and comically so, when they are cartoons — see
Finding Nemo). In return, fish will generally not feed on them. Cleaner
shrimp are colorful, with various combinations of red and white stripes
and long white antennae. They can also be kept in groups of four or five.
 Blood or fire shrimp (Lysmata debelius): This beautiful decapod is
vivid red with white spots. Although considered by some to be shy, they
aren’t really. They’re just nocturnal.
 Anemone or commensal shrimps (Periclimenes spp.): If you know that
the cleaner shrimp are like cleaner fish, and you guessed that anemone
shrimp are like anemone fish, you’re right. They live among the stinging
tentacles of the anemone, which provides them with protection. These
are generally small shrimp, rarely larger than one inch, and are almost
clear in coloration with white, brown, or purple spots. Although some
bond with a coral host, unless you’re keeping an anemone, you shouldn’t
keep anemone shrimp.
 Banded coral shrimp (Stenopus hispidus): Another common aquarium
shrimp, this species has bands of white and red, as well as a pair of long
claws. This larger species, which grows to over 2 inches, should be kept
singly; it can be aggressive with other shrimps. This shrimp is also
called the boxing shrimp or the coral-banded shrimp. A number of other
species of this genus are also available.
 Candy or camelback shrimps (Rhynchocinetes spp.): Sometimes called
the camelback shrimp because of the hump on its tail, the candy shrimp
is also named for its red and white striped coloration. These shrimp
grow to just over an inch. They are a common species in the aquarium
trade, readily available but not necessarily great for the beginner. They
eat an awful lot of polyps of various species and thus are only safe for
the largest reef tanks.

Phylum Echinodermata
This is a group of invertebrates that includes the familiar starfish as well as sea
urchins, brittle stars, sand dollars, sea cucumbers, and sea lilies. The group is
characterized by pentamerous radial symmetry, which is a fancy (and shorter)
way of saying that the average echinoderm has a body divided into five parts
arranged around a central axis like a wheel. Look at a starfish, and you will
see this clearly.
There are over 6,000 species of echinoderms, and all of them live in the
marine environment. These critters have a unique water vascular system,
which operates numerous tiny tube feet that they use for locomotion and
feeding. Some echinoderms, like starfish, have little suction cups at the end
of the tube feet that help them cling to the substrate.
There are four classes of echinoderms, but not all of them have members
suitable for the marine aquarium. The following are the most common.
Echinoderms are extremely sensitive to water salinity and under no circum-
stances should be exposed to a salinity lower 1.024 (salinity is covered in
Chapter 13).
Figure 4-9:
Shrimps are

87
Chapter 4: About Invertebrates

Sea stars
Generally referred to as starfish, these echinoderms belong to the class
Asteroidea. Sea stars, like the peppered red shown in Figure 4-10, have a cen-
tral mouth on their underside and, in some cases, they extend part of their
stomach to digest their prey. Many sea stars are carnivorous, eating other
invertebrates, like clams, using their tube feet to pry them open.
The tube feet and vascular system of the starfish are sensitive and easily
damaged. Take care when purchasing a starfish to be sure that the animal is
in good condition. Also, rapid changes in salinity will damage the vascular
system. Beginners should know that most sea stars have specialized food
requirements and generally die of malnutrition in captivity after several
months to a year.
 Orange or elegant sea star (Fromia monilis): Imported from Indonesia,
this colorful orange and red species is a common addition to the inverte-
brate aquarium. The orange starfish is not a large species, rarely growing
to more than 3 inches. It will feed readily on small pieces of seafood,
but it also needs special dietary items, like live sponges, so it is not a
species that a new aquarist should be keeping.
Figure 4-10:

ence first.
88
Part I: Getting to Know Your Fish and Invertebrates 

 Blue sea star (Linckia laevigata): This species is another popular and
colorful addition to the marine aquarium. So named for brilliant blue col-
oration, this species is readily available and easy to maintain.
 Brittle stars (Ophiactis and Ophiocoma spp.): These are not your typi-
cal starfish. Like most sea stars, they have a central disk, but their arms
are long and thin and help them move quickly around the aquarium.
Brittle stars are imported from the Caribbean, as well as the Indo-Pacific
region. Although they tend to be drab colored and nocturnal, they are
excellent scavengers and are easy to maintain.
Sea stars are well known for their ability to regenerate their limbs when they
are damaged or lost. In some species, not only does the star regenerate the
limb, but the limb can regenerate the star!
Sea urchins
Although related to the sea stars, sea urchins and their cousins the sand dol-
lars belong to a different class of echinoderms called the Echinoidea. Like the
sea stars, they are radially symmetrical, but they lack arms. Instead, sea
urchins have a calcium carbonate skeleton, called a test, with movable spines,
which you can see in Figure 4-11. If you’ve ever been to a tropical beach, it’s
not unusual to find the dried tests of sea urchins.
Figure 4-11:
Sea urchins

tive but

89
Chapter 4: About Invertebrates

Like sea stars, sea urchins have a mouth on their underside and tube feet.
However, the mouths of sea urchins have a toothed beak-like organ called
Aristotle’s lantern. This is used to gnaw algae and scavenge organic matter off
the reef. In the aquarium, sea urchins will scavenge as well.
Some sea urchins are also equipped with poison glands, which makes han-
dling them a bit of a problem. The venom is not likely to cause death, but it
will cause pain and infection.
 Long-spined sea urchins (Diadema spp.): Found throughout tropical
seas, members of this genus are favored by many aquarists. They have
long, thin spines that are extremely sharp and sometimes poisonous,
but they are easy to maintain. Coloration is generally black, but some
species and smaller sea urchins may have banded spines.
 Common or short-spined sea urchins (Echinometra spp.): Members of
this genus are sometimes called black sea urchins because of their col-
oration. They typically have shorter and blunter spines that can still
penetrate your skin. Growing to about 4 inches, these sea urchins are
easy to maintain.
 Pencil urchins (Heterocentrotus spp.): These species of sea urchins have
thick blunt spines that don’t pose a threat. Unlike most sea urchins,
which are typically drab colored, the pencil urchin can be more colorful
and, therefore, a more attractive addition to the aquarium. Although
readily available, they tend to be expensive and predatory, as well.
Sea cucumbers
Members of the class Holothuroidea are generally called sea cucumbers
because of their shape. These echinoderms are elongated, with a mouth
at one end and an anus at the other. They are related to sea stars and sea
urchins because they have tube feet.
The mouth of the sea cucumber is surrounded by tentacles, which may be
fingerlike, stalked with a button-like tip, or branched. The tentacles are actu-
ally modified tube feet: parts of the water vascular system that are used for
feeding. While some sea cucumbers filter feed, most scavenge organic matter
from the bottom, gobbling up the substrate and straining it through their
bodies.
In general, sea cucumbers aren’t recommended for the new marine aquarist
because some species can extrude toxins, when disturbed, that will poison
your aquarium.
90
Part I: Getting to Know Your Fish and Invertebrates 

Nonetheless, a couple of species are readily available and relatively easy to
maintain in captivity.
 Sea apple (Pseudocolochirus axiologus): Don’t let the name fool you,
this is indeed a sea cucumber and not a sea fruit. This is one of the most
popular aquarium species because of its striking pink, orange, yellow,
and red coloration. One is shown in Figure 4-12. With feathery tentacles,
the sea apple is a filter feeder that will position itself in the current of
your tank. It is difficult to feed, but small pieces of seafood, brine
shrimp, and rotifers will satisfy this critter. This is a species not to be
kept with fish.
 Knobby black cucumber (Stichopus chloronotus): Although aptly
named for its dark drab coloration, the black cucumber is enjoyed by
some aquarists because it swallows mouthfuls of unfiltered substrate,
scavenging detritus and providing a useful service.

Chapter 5
From the Dealer to Your Home
In This Chapter
 Picking out healthy fish
 Taking the trip home
 Introducing your new pets to their new abode
A
s I indicate in Chapter 2, your new tropical marine fish and inverte-
brates come from the farthest reaches of the world. (The Indo-Pacific is
probably not around the corner for you.) With few exceptions, fish and inver-
tebrates are collected, double-bagged, and boxed for shipment, which can
take days. That’s a long trip, but professional collectors and importers are
good at what they do. They don’t stay in business long if they deliver dead
fish, so they take great care to ensure that a healthy marine animal is deliv-
ered to your dealer.
Stress and Quarantine
Any time a living creature is abruptly removed from its natural environment
and introduced into a new one after making a trip of several thousand miles,
the critter is going to experience a little stress. How many times, after all,
have you stressed out just commuting to work? Stress in any animal can
lead to disease and death (see Chapter 17), whether it’s an anemone or an
anemonefish. So, after that long trip from the tropics, your pets need to accli-
mate to their new home and settle down a bit. This settling down period is
often referred to as the quarantine period.
In general, your new pets will have two quarantine periods: when they get to
your dealer and when they get to your home.
Don’t let the concept of a quarantine tank spook you. A quarantine tank is a
simple aquarium, usually about ten gallons, with an internal box or sponge
filter and a heater (Chapter 9 covers quarantine tanks).

The water quality of the quarantine tank must be tested routinely because
you don’t want to add your new pets to an unhealthy environment. The quar-
antine tank should be set up at the same time as the main aquarium and well
before you go to the dealer to purchase fish.
How to Choose Healthy Fish
Your goal is to have healthy fish and invertebrates in your marine aquarium,
and your dealer’s goal is, you hope, to provide them to you. Chapter 1 dis-
cusses the importance of choosing the right dealer and tells you how to go
about doing so. The right dealer has a consistent supply of healthy fish and
invertebrates. The right dealer also lets you know where they come from,
when they arrived, and how well they’re doing in captivity.
If your dealer doesn’t communicate, you need a different dealer.
When fishes arrive from distant places, they should be allowed to adjust to
captivity and settle down from the trip in quarantine for at least a week
before you consider buying them. You also want to make sure the fish is feed-
ing before you purchase it.
Your first fish should be a hardy one that’s easy to maintain (see Chapter 3).
I recommend Floridian and Caribbean fish to start with because they have
traveled the shortest distance and tend to be in better condition when they
arrive. In addition, although few species are bred in captivity, some, such as
clownfishes, are, and these species tend to be healthier and better adapted
to captivity than those imported from far off places.
Tropical marine fish are more costly than their freshwater counterparts.
Spend wisely and walk before you run.
In Chapter 1, I discuss the importance of looking for healthy fish and inverte-
brates. Here are a few more tips for choosing healthy fish:
 Buy fish only from healthy-looking aquariums with clear water, a clean
tank, and no dead fish.
 Make sure that the fish you want is healthy looking (see Chapter 18).
If the fish has any cuts, scrapes, or fin problems, don’t buy it. Watch for
possible symptoms of disease, such as white granular spots, cottony
white patches, frayed fins, or dull skin. The stomach of the fish should
be rounded and not pinched in, and the fish’s eyes should be clear.
94
Part I: Getting to Know Your Fish and Invertebrates 

 Watch the behavior of the fish. Healthy fish swim horizontally in a lively
manner and aren’t shy.
 Watch the fish feed before you buy it to make sure it has recovered from
the stress of shipping and has acclimated to life in an aquarium.
Going Home
When you’re satisfied with your choice, your dealer will net the fish or inver-
tebrate and place it in a bag containing water from the aquarium. A properly
bagged fish will have water in about two thirds of the bag and air in the remain-
ing space. The air space is very important. It provides a supply of oxygen for
the water in the bag. Some aquarium dealers have newer aquarium bags that
actually breathe. That is, air passes through the bag material and into the
water. If your dealer uses one of these bags, it will not contain an air space.
If you have a particularly long trip home or you need to keep your new pet
bagged longer than two hours, don’t add more water and sacrifice air space.
Instead, ask your dealer for a larger bag.
Some invertebrates, corals, live rock, and algae are bagged without water.
Don’t worry: This is how they are transported from distant seas, and they
will be fine.
At the check-out counter, your bagged fish should be placed in a paper bag
for the trip home. After you’re in the car, make every effort to keep the bag
from jostling too much and don’t expose it to radical changes in temperature.
Keep the fish away from direct exposure to sunlight and the car heater or air
conditioner.
Water loses heat more slowly than you may think, so for a short trip home,
you don’t need to keep your car at 75°F to 79°F. On the other hand, a heavily
air-conditioned car will slowly cool your fish if your trip home is too long.
Taking the Plunge
When you get home, take the time to acclimate your new pets to their new
home. Don’t unpack your groceries or take the dog for a walk; instead, tend
to your fish immediately. This is a relatively simple process and one that I
find to be pretty exciting.
95
Chapter 5: From the Dealer to Your Home

There are a several ways to get the fish from the bag into your quarantine
tank. The key is to minimize stress. The best way to do that is to minimize
handling and make the water in the bag similar to the water in the aquarium.
I prefer the simplest and most common method:
1. Float the unopened plastic bag (with your new fish inside) in your
tank for at least 10 to 15 minutes (Figure 5-1).
Let it sit in the tank so that the temperature in the bag can acclimate to
the temperature in the aquarium.
2. Open the bag and let air in.
To ensure that the fish will not be shocked by the aquarium water, make
sure that both have a temperature within a degree of each other.
3. Add a cupful of water from your aquarium to the bag and let it sit for
another 10 to 15 minutes.
4. Add the fish to the tank by simply and gently inverting the bag and
letting the fish out (Figure 5-2).
Figure 5-1:
Let the bag

in it float for
a while first
to acclimate.
96
Part I: Getting to Know Your Fish and Invertebrates 

If the bag water is cloudy or you suspect there have been disease issues at
the dealer, do not add the bag water to your aquarium. Instead, pour off as
much water as possible into a sink or bucket and then add the fish to the
aquarium. This method can be used to add invertebrates to your tank as well,
but make sure the salinity (the amount of salt in your aquarium water) in the
bag is very close to that in the aquarium for delicate species.
Keep a Sharp Eye on Things
Introduce your fish to the aquarium in batches, buying fish in lots every
few weeks or once a month. This is particularly important for your newly
established aquarium because it allows fish to acclimate to each other and
prevents aggressive behavior toward a single fish when it is introduced.
Be sure not to stock a marine aquarium too rapidly. Also, follow the tank
capacity guidelines outlined in Chapter 6.
Figure 5-2:

97
Chapter 5: From the Dealer to Your Home

Your new tank inhabitants are definitely worth watching. Their behavior will
probably not be normal in the beginning as they acclimate to their new sur-
roundings and new tank mates. You may see aggression between the new
arrivals and the tank inhabitants, which have set up territories. This is to be
expected, so don’t let a little nipping bother you. However, if it persists for
several days, you may want to reconsider your choice of tank mates.
New arrivals typically require several hours to acclimate to their surround-
ings, and I don’t recommend that you feed them during this period. They
aren’t likely to feed, so the food will only burden your filtration and pollute
your aquarium.

Setting Up Your
Aquarium

In this part . . .
T
he chapters in this part take you from having no
aquarium at all through choosing one and setting 
it up. I go through the process of choosing the right 
aquarium, filters, heaters, and lighting fixtures. Then I
turn to brackish water aquariums before going through
setting up your aquarium in detail. 

Chapter 6
Choosing the Best Aquarium
In This Chapter
 Figuring out where to put your aquarium
 Choosing the right aquarium for you
 Covering your aquarium
 Supporting your aquarium
I
n this chapter, I discuss one of the most important parts of the aquarium
system: the aquarium itself. You can probably get away with leaving one or
two aquarium components out of the system and having your fish survive.
They may live only one day, but they will live nonetheless. However, without
the aquarium tank itself, you and your marine friends don’t have a chance.
Fish and invertebrates simply don’t deal well without water, in a box or per-
manently in a bag: They need a tank to live in. Not just any container sold at a
pet store will do.
For marine creatures, the old-fashioned goldfish bowl isn’t a comfortable
option. I liken it to forcing someone to live in a closet without ventilation.
Keep away from goldfish bowls, Siamese fighting fish bowls, small rectangular
plastic ornamental tanks, or homemade wooden contraptions. I can guess
what you’re thinking: Who would use such things? I’ll keep the names to
myself, but it has happened before. Simply put, the aquarium tank isn’t the
piece of equipment that you decide to save a few bucks on.
As you may expect, you have quite a few options. Aquariums come in many
shapes, sizes, and styles. They can be glass or acrylic, tall or short, rectangu-
lar or multisided. What you choose depends on several factors, which
include the amount of space you have available, the amount of money you
want to spend, the number of fish you want to hold, and, last but not least,
what tickles your fancy. This chapter helps you sort through those options.

Placing Your New Aquarium
After you set up your aquarium system, you’re not going to move it unless
you take it completely apart. So choosing a permanent site for the aquarium
is something you don’t want to take lightly. (In fact, you want to decide this
during your planning process.) This section shares a few tips and reminders.
Fish watching
I think I can assume that you’re not setting up an aquarium for exercise.
Instead, you, like me, find marine fish and invertebrates fun, beautiful, peace-
ful, and exciting. So, you need to place your aquarium in an area of the house
where you will enjoy it most and where you’re likely to spend a lot of time.
(That doesn’t mean the garage if your other hobby is working on cars.)
Generally, the living room or den is a great place to put it. Well-used living
areas provide an excellent setting for your aquarium because the fish accli-
mate to people entering and leaving the room. Poorly used areas will render
fish skittish and timid when people enter or approach the tank.
Don’t, however, choose the busiest room in the house. Too much activity can
spook your tank inhabitants or cause damage to your tank. For example, the
kids’ playroom may be a fun place for the aquarium, but jumping children
and flying objects don’t blend with a peaceful aquarium.
Aquariums can be fun, but they also require some attention. Routine system
checks are easy if the aquarium is in a place where you can spend a lot of
time watching fish. You don’t want to be forced to make a special trip out to
the aquarium room in the very back of your house, past the dog that really
doesn’t like you.
Windows and doors and floors
You may have the perfect room for your aquarium picked out because you
spend a lot of time there. But a few other factors may change your mind.
Suppose the spot you chose is right next to a huge picture window, behind a
swinging door, on the third floor of a house built in 1850. Good location? Not!
Here’s why: First, although windows illuminate the room and the aquarium,
they cause problems for your little ecosystem. Light and temperature are two
very important parameters that you will keep an eye on in your aquarium
(see Chapters 8). You don’t want either of these to change greatly from day to
102
Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium 

day. An aquarium too close to windows will be illuminated by direct sunlight,
causing changes in water temperature and promoting extensive growth of
algae. Algae can be good, but too much is not.
Similarly, doors let in drafts and sunlight, causing light levels and tempera-
ture to fluctuate. In addition, a swinging door may hit your aquarium, and a
cracked aquarium is a disaster.
The strength of your floor is also very important. Make sure the part of the
house you have chosen can hold your aquarium when it’s chock-full of water,
gravel, rocks, coral, and equipment. Keep in mind that salt water weighs
8.4 pounds per gallon, so a 50-gallon tank weighs at least 420 pounds and
that’s without the other system components. The floors in older homes may
not be able to support this kind of weight.
Hot and cold
Bearing in mind that you have to maintain a relatively constant aquarium
temperature, you can see why room heaters and air conditioners can cause
problems. If you live in an area with hot and cold seasons, all your rooms
have some kind of heat source. I don’t expect you to remove it for the aquar-
ium, and you shouldn’t. The room heater actually helps the aquarium heater
to keep the water in your tank at the right temperature. (If you didn’t have
a heat source in the room, the aquarium heater would be running almost 
constantly.) On the other hand, if the room’s heat source is too close to the
aquarium, it may overheat the tank, causing water-temperature problems.
Much of this information is also true for room air conditioners, which can
cool aquarium water.
Water and power
Now, when I think about water and electricity, I see a dangerous mix. But the
fact of the matter is that when you set up an aquarium, you positively need
both to make it work. Normally, placing electric motors and gadgets in and
around a tank full of water is a no-no. (So parents, don’t let your children
set up the aquarium alone!) More than once, I’ve felt the odd sensation of
110 volts being conducted through my body because I wasn’t paying attention.
This wasn’t pleasant and was potentially lethal. Keep in mind (and teach your
children) the dangers of electricity. I cannot overemphasize the importance
of following the proper steps when setting up an aquarium.
103
Chapter 6: Choosing the Best Aquarium

All electrical equipment for your aquarium should plugged into connectors
with ground fault interruption capability. These types of outlets are inexpen-
sive, easy to install, and go a long way in preventing electrocution.
When you choose the final resting place for your aquarium, you must have
access to water and power. Moving buckets of water through a living room
loaded with antique furniture may not be the greatest idea. Running exten-
sion cords across the room to power as many as ten electrical components
doesn’t sound good, either. Instead, find a spot with easy access to a water
source and a power source.
Keep in mind that all the planning in the world won’t keep an area from get-
ting wet from the aquarium and its maintenance. You may not want to set the
tank above your favorite Oriental rug. Choose an area that can tolerate a little
moisture from time to time. Set your tank so that you have easy access on all
sides for cleaning and maintenance.
Marine tanks suffer from salt creep, which is caused by the bubbling of salt
water. When water is bubbled or is splashed, the water evaporates, leaving
the salt deposit on the tank glass, filter unit, and just about everything the
water contacts. You can reduce salt creep with an aquarium hood (and I talk
about that in the “Cap It” section of this chapter), but you must have access
to all sides of your tank so you can clean it.
Tank Size
The general rule is to buy the largest aquarium you can afford and accommo-
date in your home. The reason for this is straightforward: Would you rather
live in a one-room apartment or a five-room suite? Fish and invertebrates
require space to swim and sufficient oxygen to live, and both are limited by
the size of the tank.
The oxygen content of water is related to the surface area of the tank. Surface
area is the amount of area on the surface of the tank that’s exposed to air.
The more surface area a tank has, the more room for gas exchange at the sur-
face, and the more oxygen enters the water and toxic gases, such as carbon
dioxide, leave the water. Oxygen content is also related to the temperature of
the water. Warmer water has less oxygen than colder water. Because most
marine tropical fishes prefer water in excess of 75°F, the amount of oxygen
may be limited in the tank, so you have to increase your surface area. 
How do you do that? By choosing a tank that has a large area on top that’s
exposed to air.
104
Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium 

Tanks come in all sizes and shapes. Although two tanks may have the same
volume, their shapes dictate the amount of surface area, which may be differ-
ent. Tall, slender tanks don’t have a lot of surface area relative to the volume
of water, so you don’t get a high rate of gas exchange with one of these.
On the other hand, a short, wide tank has more surface area and is better
for gas exchange.
For example, consider two 55-gallon tanks: One measures 48 inches long x
12 inches wide x 21 inches high, and the other measures 36 inches long x
12 inches wide x 28 inches high. The volume of these tanks can be calculated
by multiplying length by width by height; the surface area is equal to just
length times width. Both tanks have a capacity of 12,096 cubic inches, but the
first tank has a surface area of 576 square inches, and the second has a sur-
face are of 432 square inches. Clearly, the first tank is preferred. These are
simple calculations, so don’t be afraid to go to your dealer with a measuring
tape and a calculator before you pick out your aquarium. You should already
have a general idea of the size you want, given the space available in the spot
you chose for the tank.
Room to move
When choosing your tank, the number of aquarium inhabitants your aquar-
ium can accommodate may factor into your decision. If you put too many
fish into your tank, you will overcrowd it, the filtration system will be over-
whelmed, and you will have serious water quality problems. In addition, fish
become stressed when they’re crowded, and stress leads to disease and
death. (Have you ever been in an overcrowded elevator?)
Several different methods have been used to determine fish capacity and
there are several general rules. Most aquarium enthusiasts use fish length
and tank volume to estimate the number of fish that a marine aquarium can
hold. Larger fish consume more oxygen and, therefore, require more aquar-
ium space.
You can probably accommodate 1 inch of fish per 4 gallons of water for the
first six months. Gradually increase fish density to 1 inch per 2 gallons after
this initial period.
For example, a 40-gallon aquarium should contain no more than 10 inches of
fish for the first six months. These may be comprised of one 3-inch queen
angel, two 1-inch clownfish, one 2-inch regal tang, one 1-inch bicolor blenny,
and two 1-inch Beau Gregory’s. After six months, additional fish may be
105
Chapter 6: Choosing the Best Aquarium

added gradually to increase the total number of inches to 20. Keep in mind,
however, that fish grow, so your 2-inch regal tang may grow to 3 inches in
those six months. Also, realize that this general rule doesn’t compensate for
the shape of the fish. The width of a fish is called its girth. For example, the
girth of an eel is much smaller then that of a grouper. The 6-inch eel is likely
to require less space than the 6-inch grouper, so the general capacity rule
doesn’t apply. If you plan to keep heavier fish, be more conservative in your
tank capacity calculations.
In my opinion, it’s better to err on the side of too few fish than too many.
Bottom line
You may be saying to yourself, “If you leave it up to me, I’ll buy the smallest
and least expensive tank because I want to minimize my investment.” This is
not the best approach.
A saltwater aquarium is a big investment in money and time, so don’t go
halfway. All the time in the world won’t keep a very small tank from becoming
a problem. Buying the wrong tank will lead you to either buy the right one
down the road anyway or will discourage you from becoming a long-term
aquarium enthusiast, resulting in a waste of money either way. The bottom
line is this: If you can’t afford or accommodate an aquarium that’s at least 30
gallons, don’t make the investment.
Types of Tanks
After you’ve decided on the appropriate size and shape of your aquarium,
choosing the tank itself is largely a matter of personal taste. In my early years
of aquarium keeping a few decades ago, plate glass tanks and goldfish bowls
were the standard. In those days, many of these tanks were framed in metal
and came in standard 10-, 20-, and 55-gallon rectangular sizes. Wow, how
times have changed with the development of plastics! Modern aquariums
now not only come in a variety of sizes, but also in a number of interesting
shapes. Have you ever seen an aquarium table? It’s out there. Both glass and
acrylic tanks are available to you, and each has its distinct advantages and
disadvantages. Both styles can be purchased reef-ready, as well. That means
that the tanks have predrilled holes for equipment and plumbing, but this fea-
ture can be a bit more expensive.
106
Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium 

Old school glass
Glass tanks, like the one shown in Figure 2-1, are sealed with a silicone rubber
cement. Although the most common design is rectangular, glass tanks are
also available in a variety of multisided shapes such as octagon and hexagon.
The newer “bow front” aquarium has a really neat curvature to the front
panel that I find particularly attractive. Glass aquariums are built for the sole
purpose of housing living animals and are, therefore, nontoxic. Glass also
doesn’t scratch as easily as acrylic does.
Glass is heavy, though, and the larger the tank, the thicker the glass. Keep
this in mind when you’re finding a good location for the aquarium. Most glass
aquariums are equipped with plastic frames that provide some stability as
well as attractiveness. The frames come in a variety of colors and styles, so
you can pick one that matches the drapes, if you so choose.
In today’s aquarium market, the glass used in these tanks may be either
plated or tempered. I don’t have the space to get into the specifics of how
each glass type is made, but suffice it to say that plate glass won’t shatter like
tempered glass will, and plate glass is more common than tempered, but not
as strong. If you plan to drill holes in your glass aquarium for filter plumbing,
make sure it is plate glass.
In general, glass aquariums are still preferred by many aquarists, but with
each passing year I see more and more turn to acrylic.

Chapter 6: Choosing the Best Aquarium

Crazy-looking acrylic
Acrylic aquariums are molded as a single piece with few seams. This makes
them more transparent, but you will get some viewing distortion of the tank
inhabitants at the corners. Acrylic is also lighter than glass and is offered in
more shapes and sizes than standard glass aquariums. Acrylic tends to be
stronger than glass, so it doesn’t break or shatter as easily.
However, acrylic tanks do scratch easily and can be quite a bit more expensive
than glass. Algae scrapers and tank decorations can also cause damage to the
tank when not properly handled. Although not easy to repair, scratches in the
acrylic can be buffed out with special scratch-remover kits.
When choosing your tank, either glass or acrylic, be sure you select one with
no scratches. Also check that no areas are devoid of silicone by closely
inspecting the aquarium seams.
I don’t recommend this if you’re a beginner, but some enthusiasts build their
own tanks. If you have some technical expertise in handling glass or plastics,
go for it, but be sure to use nontoxic silicone cement to seal the seams.
Cap It
An essential item for any aquarium is a hood (also called a canopy or cover).
This important piece of equipment performs many functions that will make
your life and those of your friends in the tank easier.
 Protection from above: It prevents unwanted items from entering the tank
and injuring the fish. If little Johnny decides to throw the sand-covered
Nerf ball in the house, it’s nice to know that the ball, the sand, and little
Johnny will not end up in the tank.
 Protection from below: It prevents overzealous fish from jumping out of
the tank. No doubt about it: Fish will jump. Sometimes they’re motivated
by another member of the aquarium community; sometimes they’re
spooked by sudden vibrations or movement in the room. Other times,
they simply run out of water while swimming toward the surface.
When your buddy Bobby comes over and knocks or raps on the aquarium,
this can also cause skittish fish to jump. Remember, fish can’t breathe
air, and nothing is worse than finding your pet on the floor next to the
aquarium in the morning.
 Protection of surroundings: The cover prevents water from splashing
to the walls and floor, causing damage to the aquarium surroundings
and salt creep. You don’t want to ruin your upholstery.
108
Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium 

 Protection from evaporation: The hood slows the rate of water evapo-
ration from the tank. A properly working aquarium has a lot of water
movement and bubbling from aeration and filtration. In most aquariums,
the water temperature is over 75°F. Water evaporates when it bubbles
and when it is kept at a high temperature. Now when water evaporates
from a seawater aquarium, the salts don’t leave the tank but become
more concentrated, thereby increasing the salinity. (Salinity is discussed
in Chapters 9 and 13.) This disturbs the fish and water quality if not
carefully monitored. No matter what you do, you need to routinely add
water to the tank. To reduce the amount of water required, you use an
aquarium hood. Water condenses on the cover and reenters the tank
instead of evaporating to the room.
 Protection from cooling: The hood helps the aquarium to retain heat,
thereby reducing the use of the heating unit.
 Protection from electrocution: The hood keeps water from damaging the
aquarium light and prevents a potentially dangerous electrical problem.
Remember, water and electricity are both important for the aquarium,
but you still want to keep them apart.
The hood is generally fitted to the dimensions of the tank and can be
adjusted to allow for aquarium accessories. Make sure that it’s composed
of thick (1⁄8-inch) glass or plastic so that it can support the weight of other
aquarium components if needed. In addition, it should be segmented so that
the entire assembly need not be removed to feed the fish or work in the tank.
I strongly recommend the type of hood that also houses the aquarium light.
These units are self contained and properly designed to keep water away
from the lighting unit, to minimize danger, and to cover the entire tank thor-
oughly. I’ve always felt that the tank, stand, and hood should be purchased
as a package built by the same manufacturer. This ensures that aquarium
components won’t be mismatched, and the package may be less expensive
than buying separate components. \
More Than a Little Support
The best support for the heavy weight of the aquarium and all its compo-
nents is a commercially manufactured aquarium stand. This type of support is
built to hold a full aquarium (hundreds of pounds). Homemade stands and
common household furniture may look sturdy, but they can fail under such a
heavy load. The weight of the tank, all its components, and water (8.4 pounds
per gallon) could reach 500 to over 1,000 pounds, depending on its size.
Stand failure can be costly to both the aquarist and the homeowner, not to
mention the fish. Gallons of water can wreck havoc on a room, so don’t try to
save money on your aquarium stand — unless you’re thinking you might also
like an indoor pool.
109
Chapter 6: Choosing the Best Aquarium

Of course, if your aquarium is very large, you can place it directly on the
floor. But even with a tall tank, you’ll still have to look down to enjoy the
action, and that can be a pain in the neck, literally.
The most common commercially built aquarium stands are made out of iron
or wood. Which one you buy depends on your personal preference.
Iron
Wrought-iron and angle-iron stands are the simplest and least expensive to
buy. The design of these stands is open, which doesn’t provide much room to
hide aquarium components, but they are very sturdy.
Wood
If you’re willing to spend more for something more decorative, buy a wooden
cabinet stand. The aquarium sits on a cabinet that can house aquarium sup-
plies and equipment behind doors on the front. These cabinets come in a
variety of styles and finishes that will likely match your room décor, if that’s
important to you. 
The most expensive aquarium stand is the aquarium enclosure. This is really
a cabinet stand that includes a canopy that covers the top of the tank.
The canopy may or may not be attached to the cabinet as one piece. These
stands can be quite elegant, making the aquarium a handsome addition to
your room.
Be careful to stay away from cabinet stands made of particleboard because
they will come apart after long-term exposure to water.
If you decide to use a piece of furniture for an aquarium stand, place under
the tank a 5⁄8-inch sheet of plywood and a 1⁄2-inch sheet of polystyrene cut to
the dimensions of the tank. These layers will even out any imperfections in
the supporting surface and distribute the load of the tank. Homemade stands
aren’t uncommon, but if you go this route, make sure that you use materials
that can hold hundreds of pounds level.

Figuring Out Filters
In This Chapter
 Keeping your water clean with filters
 Finding filters for today’s aquarium
 Knowing which filter is right for you
 Putting oxygen in your aquarium water
T
he most important requirement for healthy fish is clean water. Just as
air is to humans, water is to fish and marine invertebrates. Imagine
how you would feel if you were literally forced to inhale bad air, like car
exhaust, all the time. Fish in the natural marine environment live in an
open system where products of respiration (breathing) and digestion are
readily swept away and naturally filtered. The sheer volume of water keeps
problem substances at low levels unless environmental pollution impacts
the area.
On the other hand, fish housed in the aquarium live in a closed system where
products of respiration and digestion remain until they are removed. The pri-
mary piece of equipment that removes toxic substances from the aquarium is
the filter. An aquarium without a filter is like living in a house without plumb-
ing. Ugh!
In Chapters 12 and 13, I discuss the chemistry of water and how it affects
your fish. You don’t need to read those chapters before making some 
important decisions on filtration, however. Basically, all you need to know
is that fish and invertebrates are living creatures that, like all living things,
take substances from the environment and give substances back to the 
environment.

Respiration and Digestion
Like most living creatures, fish and invertebrates need to breathe oxygen to
stay alive. When they remove oxygen from the water, they put back carbon
dioxide. We call this respiration. Humans respire as well, only we can’t do it
underwater. So, not only do fish need oxygen in the water, but they also
change the chemistry of the water by putting back carbon dioxide.
Fish and invertebrates in your aquarium also need energy to live, and this
comes from the food you feed them. Just like other living creatures that eat
food, these animals process it internally, taking away important nutrients and
disposing of wastes. These wastes, which break down into ammonia, need to
be removed from the water, as well.
The inhabitants of your aquarium aren’t the only ones that put substances
into your aquarium water. So do you. Not all the food that you feed your pets
is consumed, and those morsels that aren’t consumed become aquarium
waste that breaks down into its chemical components like carbon, nitrogen,
and hydrogen.
As you can read more about in Chapter 12, ammonia and other compounds
with nitrogen are harmful to fish and invertebrates, so they need to be
removed from the aquarium. This is the job of the filter.
Cleaning Your Water
Just as the name implies, the filter is a piece of equipment that filters the water
in your aquarium. When the aquarium water is filtered, certain substances
are either removed from the water and retained in the filter or converted to
less harmful compounds and returned to the aquarium. This process is called
filtration. Substances that are retained in the filter need to be disposed of
when the filter is cleaned.
Not all filters are the same, and no filter removes all the harmful substances
from the water. So, although filters help you clean the water, they don’t do all
the work for you. You still need to make partial water changes to remove
some substances, and you also need to clean your filter (see Chapter 15).
Not all filters perform the same kind of filtration. The part of the filter that
actually does all the work is the filter medium (more than one medium is
media, and some filters have several kinds of filter media). For example, the
typical powerfilter has synthetic filter floss in it. This floss filters the water
112
Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium 

by removing large debris but also provides an area for bacteria to grow.
These bacteria act to filter the water, as well. Therefore, filter floss really 
provides two kinds of filtration.
We categorize filtration into three different kinds: mechanical, biological, and
chemical. Some filters provide only one kind, whereas others provide all
three. It’s like having ice cream that’s just vanilla or ice cream that’s vanilla,
chocolate, and strawberry. For your saltwater aquarium, you want all three
flavors (of filtration that is, not ice cream).
Mechanical filtration
Filters that provide mechanical filtration physically remove suspended parti-
cles from the water by passing it through a fine filter medium, which sifts out
particles. The filter floss does this. Many filters that you find at the dealer
provide at least some degree of mechanical filtration. You can think of
mechanical filtration as being very similar to skimming debris from the sur-
face of a pool, only the debris isn’t only from the surface of the water but
from the entire aquarium.
If not removed, these larger particles that are suspended in your aquarium
eventually break down into smaller molecules that mess up your water chem-
istry. Getting them out when they’re larger saves your aquarium a lot of
potential trouble. Obviously, smaller molecules aren’t removed by mechani-
cal filtration, so they need to be removed by other means. External powerfil-
ters and canister filters provide rapid mechanical filtration using filter floss.
Biological filtration 
Biological filtration uses the most abundant form of life in the world — 
bacteria — to remove harmful molecules, such as ammonia, from the water
in your aquarium. Although when you think of bacteria, you probably think
of nasty little buggers that cause problems, in all honesty, we would be in
serious trouble if we didn’t have bacteria in our lives. In an aquarium, 
bacteria drive the nitrogen cycle, which is the conversion of a harmful nitroge-
nous substance, like ammonia, into a less harmful substance, like nitrate.
In Chapter 12, I discuss the nitrogen cycle in detail because it is essential to
the successful maintenance of your aquarium. For this chapter, suffice it say
that the bacteria that live in a filter or filter media provide biological filtration
of your aquarium water, thereby removing molecules that mechanical filtra-
tion can’t.
113
Chapter 7: Figuring Out Filters

The traditional example of a biological filter is an undergravel filter, which
draws water through the aquarium substrate. The substrate is the stuff that
you put on the bottom of the aquarium — the gravel. The gravel is actually
filter media because it contains the necessary bacteria to convert nitroge-
nous wastes to nitrate. Some filters provide both biological and mechanical
filtration. A good example is filter floss. It not only acts as a mechanical filter,
it also provides a substrate for bacteria to colonize for biological filtration.
Although this type of filtration requires a bit more time to establish a healthy
bacterial colony, it provides the best kind of filtration — and every saltwater
aquarium requires biological filtration.
After your biological filter is well established, don’t throw it out to clean it —
you would have to start from scratch to reestablish a new bacterial colony.
Biological filters that allow you to simply rinse the media and reuse it are the
best ones to purchase so that your bacterial friends are saved and can help
you another day.
Chemical filtration
When you add activated charcoal to your filter, you’re providing chemical 
filtration to your water; that is, the filter is using a chemical treatment to
remove toxic substances from the aquarium. Some aquarists consider chemi-
cal filtration to be another form of mechanical filtration, but at the molecular
level. Think of mechanical filtration as the removal of debris that’s suspended
in the water and chemical filtration as the chemical removal of substances
that are dissolved in the water.
For example, activated carbon in your powerfilter absorbs dissolved mole-
cules from the water by trapping them. Other filter media, like zeolite and 
ion-exchange resins, similarly remove toxins from the water by taking advan-
tage of their molecular shape. You can turn a filter that provides mechanical
filtration, biological filtration, or both into a one that also provides chemical
filtration by adding one of these media to the filter. Many of the commercially
available filters on today’s market allow you to do this, primarily with acti-
vated carbon.
Chemical filters get used up over time and need to be replaced. Whereas
some mechanical and biological filter media can be rinsed, chemical filter
media like activated carbon should be thrown out every month or so (see
Chapter 15).
114
Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium 

Filter Choices
Most commercially manufactured aquarium filters provide all three kinds of
filtration (mechanical, biological, and chemical), but they do so to different
degrees of effectiveness. For example, an external powerfilter mechanically
removes particles, chemically removes toxins (if it contains activated carbon),
and biologically converts nitrogenous wastes via the nitrogen cycle in its
filter media.
However, you must match the filter with the aquarium. For example, imagine
that you’re shopping for a vacuum cleaner. A lot depends on what kind of
floor you’re cleaning and on how big the room is. You’re not going to need
a really powerful vacuum for wood floors, but a mini-vac may be too small
for a living room. The same is true for aquarium filters. The extent to which
you need to clean your water is dependent on the type of aquarium you’re
planning.
Invertebrate and reef aquariums need to have the highest possible water
quality for their inhabitants. Invertebrates like corals, sponges, and
anemones are sensitive to even the smallest amounts of harmful substances
such as ammonia. On the other hand, if you’re the owner of a fish-only 
aquarium (no invertebrates), you don’t need to keep sensitive invertebrates
alive, so the filtration system can be less efficient and, perhaps, a little less
expensive.
The size of the aquarium is important, as well. Just as a mini-vac won’t clean
a large room efficiently, a small filter won’t keep up with a large aquarium.
Size your filtration system to your aquarium — a good dealer can assist you
in doing so.
Some of the filters available to the aquarist include internal box filters, exter-
nal powerfilters, canister filters, undergravel filters, trickle filters, live rock,
fluidized bed filters, protein skimmers, and complete external water manage-
ment systems. In addition, water-sterilization techniques are also available
in the form of ultraviolet (UV) sterilizers and ozonizers. Choosing the right
system for your new aquarium can be a bit confusing given all the different
kinds and manufacturers. For the marine aquarium, I thoroughly recommend
multiple filter systems, which include all three types of filtration discussed in
the preceding section.
115
Chapter 7: Figuring Out Filters

In this section, I describe each filter type, give you an idea of what kind of fil-
tration it provides and for what kind of saltwater aquarium it applies, and
offer some specific recommendations so that you don’t leave this chapter
overwhelmed by the options. Keep in mind that because this book is a 
reference, I’m obliged to at least introduce you to the current technology.
By doing so, I don’t want to confuse you, I only want you to be familiar with
all types of filters so that you’re ready when an aquarium dealer tells you that
you “must” buy a particular system.
Inside box filter
Also known as a corner filter, an internal box filter is one of the most basic
forms of aquarium filters. Usually relegated to the corner of the aquarium,
this small, clear plastic box is filled with filter floss and activated carbon,
working its little heart out to keep the aquarium clean. Air is driven from an
external air source down into the center of the box, creating a vacuum as it
exits and drawing water into the filter. The water pulled in is filtered through
the floss mechanically and through the carbon chemically (see Figure 7-1).
If the filter is allowed to mature over time, the floss provides a substrate or
medium for bacterial colonies to establish, providing biological filtration.
Sounds great, right?

Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium 

Wrong! Although very inexpensive (less than $10), the box filter is by far the
most primitive filter — I haven’t had one since my famous freshwater guppy
tank of 1971. It’s simply too small and inefficient to handle the wastes and debris
that accumulate in the aquarium. That doesn’t mean that there’s no place for
the box filter in certain saltwater aquarium systems. Some aquarists use the
simple box filter to keep their smaller quarantine tanks clean (see Chapter 5).
Box filters are maintained by replacing the activated carbon and the filter floss,
although some of the latter should be retained for the bacteria that they harbor.
Sponge filter
Sponge filters, like the one shown in Figure 7-2, have rapidly replaced box fil-
ters in most small saltwater aquarium tanks, such as a quarantine aquarium
(see Chapter 5). As the name implies, the filter is composed of a sponge mater-
ial that’s highly porous. Like the box filter, the sponge filter sits in the aquarium
and sticks out like a sore thumb. Air is driven into the sponge from an external
air pump, and water is pulled into the filter as the air escapes. These filters
provide some mechanical filtration, but more importantly, they have enough
surface area to support a lot of beneficial bacteria for biological filtration.
The sponge itself provides the filter medium, so you don’t need additional
media. These filters provide no chemical filtration. Sponge filters are easy to
maintain (simply rinse), are very inexpensive (less than $10), and come in
sizes that can filter tanks up to 125 gallons. However, they are simply too inef-
ficient for a typical saltwater aquarium, except for smaller quarantine tanks.

Chapter 7: Figuring Out Filters

Undergravel filter
Undergravel filters are the old workhorses of the saltwater aquarium hobby.
For many years, they have been considered the most efficient filters for salt-
water aquaria, and no successful tank was found without one. Although times
have changed, and more advanced filtration systems are now available, the
undergravel filter is still considered by some to be an effective filtration
choice. Although this filter has evolved, and improvements have increased its
filtration efficiency, fewer and fewer aquarists use the undergravel filter as
newer technology becomes more readily available.
The original variety
A basic undergravel filter consists of a perforated plastic plate that rests on
the bottom of your aquarium tank under your gravel. At each rear corner of
the plate is a lift tube that extends up into the aquarium. Air is pumped to the
bottom of each lift tube, and bubbles that come right back up the tube create
a water vacuum. This pulls aquarium water down through the gravel and the
filter plate and out the lift tube. Therefore, you get water circulating from the
aquarium down through the gravel.
In an undergravel filter, your gravel acts as the filter media. Particles and
debris get trapped in the gravel providing mechanical filtration. More impor-
tantly, excellent biological filtration is provided when the gravel becomes the
home of millions of bacteria that break down harmful ammonia. For this
reason, certain kinds of gravel are required for this filter, and a longer setup
time is necessary to establish bacterial colonies. Most undergravel filters are
covered by two grades of gravel: fine gravel on top of coarse, separated by
what is known as a gravel tidy. After a healthy filtration system is established,
this filter can be used for months without intense maintenance and cleaning.
A basic undergravel filter, however, has its share of problems. Debris accumu-
lates in the gravel and needs to be routinely vacuumed out so that the filter
doesn’t get clogged. Cleaning can be difficult if too many corals and rocks are
sitting in the tank, and that’s why they aren’t well suited for the reef aquar-
ium. Most undergravel filters don’t provide chemical filtration, but carbon
cartridges that fit on the lift tubes are now available. Also, although air-driven
undergravel filters provide aeration, they tend to be noisy and may not be
strong enough to provide for adequate water circulation, particularly as the
gravel clogs.
Reverse flow
How do you avoid clogging the gravel in an undergravel filter? Reverse the
flow of water through it and instead of pulling water through, push it. This
way, the filter media doesn’t get as heavily clogged, and the efficiency of the
filter is maintained. There are a couple of ways to reverse the flow of water
118
Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium 

through the filter: The most common way involves adding another filter to
the process. By pumping water from the output of a canister filter down the
lift tube of the undergravel filter, you can easily reverse the flow of the entire
system. You won’t have the mechanical filtration of the gravel, but the canis-
ter filter does that for you. (I discuss canister filters in more detail in the
“Canister filters” section, later in this chapter). The reverse flow gravel filter
provides excellent biofiltration (biological filtration) without some of the
problems associated with the basic system.
Powerheads
As a major improvement to the undergravel filter, powerheads were invented
to replace the less efficient air-driven system. The powerhead is a small
pump that sits on top of the lift tube and literally pulls water through the
gravel from the aquarium (see Figure 7-3). This not only improves filter effi-
ciency but also increases water circulation. These are two big bonuses.
What about aeration? Powerheads now come with a venturi aerator, which
introduces air into the outflow. But wait, there’s more! Reverse flow power-
heads are now available that allow you to have a reverse flow undergravel
filter without a canister filter.

Chapter 7: Figuring Out Filters

However, as good as powerheads sound, they don’t provide filtration, they
just move water efficiently.
Undergravel filters are relatively inexpensive filters that provide good biologi-
cal filtration for a fish-only aquarium. If you’re going to use an undergravel
system, reverse flow is the most efficient, either with powerheads or, prefer-
ably, with a canister filter for added filtration.
Powerfilters
A powerfilter is the one of the easiest and least complicated filter systems for
you to employ as a beginner aquarist. The design is simple: Water is pulled
into the filter media and pumped back to the tank. But, as is the case with
most filter systems nowadays, powerfilters have improved over the years,
and now a few kinds are available.
External powerfilter
An external powerfilter looks like a big square cup that hangs on the outside
of the tank and is powered by its own motor. The filter generally contains
filter floss or filter sponges and activated carbon as filter media. Water is
drawn into the filter by a U-shaped intake tube, flows through the filter
media, and is pumped back to the tank either through a tube or a spillway.
The filter media provide mechanical and chemical filtration; biological filtration
is established as the filter matures and bacteria colonize it. Therefore, these
filters provide all three kinds of filtration and are specifically designed to turn
over large amounts of water. The powerfilter also circulates the water, provid-
ing valuable aeration.
These filters are easy to maintain — most have simple cartridges that can be
routinely replaced. However, retain some of the used filter floss or use a
sponge-type media so that you can hang onto helpful bacteria.
External powerfilters are ideal for tanks that also have an undergravel filter
system or live rock.
Biowheels
Some external powerfilters come with a nifty option called a biowheel (see
Figure 7-4). The biowheel comes into contact with both the air and water in
the filter. As water moves through the filter, the wheel spins, exposing mil-
lions of bacteria that live on the wheel to the air and the water. Because these
120
Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium 

bacteria need air to efficiently convert ammonia, this system provides
enhanced biological filtration in your powerfilter. Also, the biowheel allows
you to retain these bacteria even though you have to replace the internal
filter media. Biowheels aren’t available only on external powerfilters but are
also offered as separate units that hang on the back of your aquarium and are
powered by a powerhead or canister filter.
Internal powerfilters
I mention internal powerfilters not because they are an improvement to the
external powerfilter but because they are currently available on the market.
These filters are similar to the external powerfilter, but sit inside the tank,
taking up valuable space and obstructing the view. However, some newer
models are neatly disguised as aquarium decorations. Although most models
provide mechanical, chemical, and biological filtration, I don’t recommend
them as a permanent filter system.

Chapter 7: Figuring Out Filters

Canister filters
A canister filter (see Figure 7-5) is really just an external powerfilter that doesn’t
hang on the tank but sits on the floor or under the aquarium. I’m treating it
separately because the canister filter is a different category of powerfilter
that’s much more efficient. The canister filter is a self-contained, high-pressure
pump that draws water from the aquarium with an intake tube and returns
it with a output tube that can be directed anywhere the aquarist desires
(preferably back to the tank). As discussed in the earlier “Undergravel filters”
section, output from a canister filter can be directed at another filtration
system, such as a reverse flow undergravel filter or a biowheel.
The filter itself contains compartments with various kinds of filter media,
such as activated carbon, filter sponges, filter floss, and ceramic bodies.
Water is pumped over all the media layers, providing mechanical, chemical,
and biological filtration. These filters are more expensive, yet provide excel-
lent efficient filtration at a high rate. These filters don’t need to be cleaned
frequently, and the use of multiple filter media allows valuable bacteria to be
retained when the filter is cleaned every three or four months.
If you intend to have more than a fish-only saltwater aquarium, the high effi-
ciency of a canister filter makes it one of my recommended filter options.

Trickle filters
Trickle filters, also known as wet-dry filters, were once reserved for aquarists
who built their own filter systems. Now, many companies commercially man-
ufacture a number of styles and sizes for home aquariums. In essence, the
theory behind the trickle filter is to maximize the exposure of the aquarium
water to bacteria and air at the same time (like a biowheel does) so that bac-
terial conversion of ammonia is most efficient.
An overflow box on the back of your tank delivers water from the aquarium
to the large acrylic trickle filter box. Some tanks are predrilled with overflow
boxes in the tank and water exits the aquarium through a bulkhead into the
trickle filter. The filter box is generally divided into two compartments. The
main compartment contains multiple layers of filter media for mechanical,
biological, and chemical filtration. This compartment is mostly dry except for
the lower few inches. The other compartment contains a pump and other
optional equipment. Water from the aquarium is sprayed or trickles evenly
over the first compartment through the filter media where it collects at the
bottom (or sump), moves into the other compartment, and returns to the
aquarium (see Figure 7-6).

123
Chapter 7: Figuring Out Filters

The filter is called a wet-dry filter because of a basic division of bacterial labor
in the system. The dry part involves the multiple layers of filter media above
the wet part. These media include coarse and fine matting for mechanical fil-
tration and plastic spheres known as bioballs for bacterial colonization. Bags
of activated carbon are typically placed in the sump for chemical filtration.
In the dry part of the filter, water dripping through the system has maximum
exposure to air and bacteria for efficient conversion of ammonia to nitrate.
The wet portion of the filtration in the sump involves the further conversion
of nitrogen compounds (nitrate) to less harmful nitrogen gas. The bacteria
that do this don’t need oxygen, and the wet portion of the filter allows this to
happen. Unfortunately, in most trickle filters, the dry part works very well
(up to 20 times better than an undergravel filter) but the wet part is not as
efficient, so nitrates must be removed by other means. I discuss this in
greater detail in Chapter 12.
Trickle filters offer great advantages over other filter systems relative to fil-
tration efficiency and effectiveness. In addition, many trickle filters on the
market today allow you to add other aquarium components to the second
compartment of the filter. These include heaters and protein skimmers (see
the following section).
Live rock
The use of live rock as a filtration method is becoming increasingly popular in
the aquarium trade. Live rock is coral rubble or reef rock that is permeated
with organisms (see Chapter 9 for more on live rock). The kinds of life that
can be found on live rock include bacteria, many kinds of algae, corals,
sponges, snails, clams, bryozoans, sea squirts, crabs, barnacles, shrimps,
starfish, and worms. Some aquarists rely solely on live rock, an external filter
(power, canister, trickle), and a protein skimmer (see the section, “Protein
skimmers”). Bacterial colonies housed on and in the live rock provide biologi-
cal filtration at very high levels. The other filter augments the live rock and
provides mechanical, chemical, and additional biological filtration. Live rock
is easy to maintain, keeping aquariums clean for months to years with very
little maintenance.
Live rock was once considered essential for only reef tanks, but now it is
becoming the filter of choice for all types of marine aquariums. Although
some species of fish in fish-only tanks will pick at and consume critters living
on the live rock, this does not affect the beneficial bacterial colonies provid-
ing biological filtration. Aquarists who use live rock don’t have to deal with
124
Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium 

the problems associated with the function, maintenance, and cleaning of an
undergravel filter system. This means less tank intrusion, less accumulation
of waste, and better water quality.
Although I mention all kinds of filter options in this section, the saltwater
aquarium keeper is best served by a combination of filters comprising live
rock and an external filter system.
Filters’ Helpers
This section contains information about those kinds of filters that help the
primary filter system to maintain water quality. I’ve separated these filters
from the previous section to emphasize the fact that these filters need to be
matched with others for a complete system. Think of these filters as compo-
nents of a stereo system. The receiver may work beautifully, but you need
speakers to make it a complete set.
Fluidized bed filters
Although a relative newcomer to the aquarium world, the fluidized bed filter
is considered one of the most efficient biological filters. The operation of this
filter is quite simple. The unit consists of a sand-filled chamber that either
hangs on or sits under your aquarium. An inlet port directs water into the
filter and outlets return water to the aquarium. In the filter, your aquarium
water comes into contact with millions of sand grains populated by beneficial
bacteria for extremely efficient biological filtration.
Some manufacturers claim that these units have 20 times the biological filter-
ing capacity of the same volume trickle filter. The problem is, that’s all they
do. Therefore, if you intend to have a fluidized bed filter, you need some
other filter, like a canister filter or external powerfilter, for mechanical and
chemical filtration and aeration. Fluidized bed filters also need some kind of
pump to move water through them. Therefore, you must purchase a power-
head or a similar pump in addition to the filter.
The efficiency of a fluidized bed filter makes it a perfect candidate for a reef
aquarium, but other filters are required to provide mechanical and chemical
filtration.
125
Chapter 7: Figuring Out Filters

In-line filters
I briefly mention in-line filters here because they can be used in conjunction
with fluidized-bed filters to provide mechanical and chemical filtration. In-line
filters are just chambers that contain cartridges with filter media. Water must
be supplied to the filters via a powerhead or similar pump.
Protein skimmers
At one time used only in the advanced marine aquarium, the protein skimmer
is now commercially available and is an essential piece of equipment for all
saltwater enthusiasts. This piece of equipment utilizes foam fractionation to
remove dissolved organic wastes from the water. What does that mean?
Basically, the protein skimmer is a tube that hangs in the back of your tank.
Air is delivered to the bottom of the tube by an external source, generating
a cloud of fine bubbles that flow to the surface. Proteins and other wastes
adhere to the bubbles, travel to the surface, and collect in a removable cup
that’s emptied. This is really just a form of chemical filtration, but unlike
other filters, wastes are actually removed from the water and not converted
to something else. So the protein skimmer takes a lot of burden off the other
filters.
With so many protein skimmers on the market, keep in mind that their effec-
tiveness depends on how long the air bubbles are in contact with the water
of the aquarium. In general, the different types of protein skimmers carry out
this process in a couple of different ways, which are discussed in the two fol-
lowing subsections.
Counter-current
Counter-current is just a fancy way of saying that the water in the protein
skimmer moves in the opposite direction of the air flowing through it.
Therefore, in these units, water is pushed down the skimmer cylinder by a
powerhead or water pump, and air supplied by an air pump to a wooden air-
stone rises from the bottom of the cylinder. These units typically hang in the
tank, thereby obstructing your view and taking up valuable aquarium space.
A counter-current skimmer is shown in Figure 7-7.
The effectiveness of this kind of protein skimmer depends on the height
of the cylinder, which is limited by the height of the tank. The longer the
skimmer column, the more air-water contact and the better the cleaning effi-
ciency. Keep this in mind when you select your protein skimmer.
126
Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium 

Venturi
These units allow water and air to be injected into the skimmer at the same
time by the same water pump. They are situated outside the tank and can be
kept out of sight. Although they tend to cost more, you don’t have to worry
about a separate air supply and wooden airstones.
You can add protein skimmers to your trickle filter sump — several models
are designed for that application. So if you plan on having a trickle filter
system, you probably want to consider a protein skimmer that will fit into it
and be kept out of sight.
No matter what kind of saltwater aquarium you have, I strongly recommend
that you outfit it with a protein skimmer. This minimal investment will save
you and your filtration system a lot of time and trouble. Your fish and inverte-
brates will like it, too.

Chapter 7: Figuring Out Filters

Diatom filters
This unique aquarium filter system takes advantage of technology that has
been deployed by swimming pool filters for decades. Diatoms are tiny single-
celled algae that are encased in tiny shells composed of silica. Diatom filters
use powder-like filter media comprising these tiny skeletons, which have tiny
pores capable of filtering the smallest particles.
Diatom filters are mechanical filters that are actually too efficient, because
they remove even the beneficial free-floating tiny animals that your aquarium
invertebrates feed on. They are so efficient that they clog rapidly if used for
more than an hour. Therefore, diatom filters aren’t good for permanent filtra-
tion and are best suited to short-term water “polishing” after the bottom is
stirred up.
Denitrators
These relatively new pieces of aquarium equipment are designed to reduce
the nitrate load in your tank. Nitrate is the end product of the nitrogen cycle
(see Chapter 12) and is usually removed with frequent partial water changes.
The denitrator (the name sounds like a killer robot) uses bacteria to break
down nitrate, providing biological filtration and reducing the need for partial
water changes. Most denitrators consist of a simple airtight chamber filled
with substrate for bacterial growth. Although most fit nicely into the sump of
a trickle filter, some models can be placed in the aquarium.
Denitrators are a relatively new innovation for the aquarium trade, and, as far
as I’m concerned, the jury is still out relative to their effectiveness. If your
budget allows for the purchase of one, or if one comes with your trickle filter,
fine. Otherwise, consider this piece of equipment optional.
Complete water-management systems
For your new aquarium, you can buy a complete water-management system
that incorporates the biological filtration of trickle filters with chemical and
mechanical filtration, heaters, aerators, denitrators, and protein skimmers.
These units can be very expensive, but represent the future of water-quality
management in home aquariums. Before you purchase your aquarium com-
ponents, at least look into one of these new systems.
128
Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium 

Water Disinfection
There are two common methods for disinfecting water that are commercially
available to the home aquarist: ultraviolet sterilizers (UV) and ozonizers.
Although some authors recommend one or both of them for the marine
aquarium — and, therefore, I discuss them in this section — I don’t think
they’re necessary because they can cause more problems than they are worth.
UV sterilizers
Ultraviolet sterilizers are self-contained units that kill some microorganisms
that may be harmful to your fishes. Water is passed from your powerfilter
or canister filter to the UV unit, where it is exposed to ultraviolet light
before being returned to the tank. However, the effectiveness of this method
depends on many factors, and its usefulness for the home aquarist has been
questioned. I recommend UV disinfection only if you intend to maintain deli-
cate species of fishes and only to treat severe outbreaks of disease.
Ozonizers
Ozonizers produce ozone, a compound consisting of three atoms of oxygen, that
kills microorganisms in the aquarium. However, the chemistry of ozone in sea-
water is poorly understood, and ozone can be harmful to humans. Therefore,
I don’t encourage the beginner to use ozonizers for water disinfection.
Which Filter System Is Best for You?
With all these filters that I’ve presented, I can imagine that you’re sitting
there thinking, “Thanks for the laundry list, Greg, but which filter is best for
me?” The simple answer to your question is: Use a combination of filters and
put the best filtration system into your aquarium that you can afford. In the
old days, an undergravel filter was a must and this was generally combined
with an external powerfilter. Nowadays, the undergravel filter is going extinct.
It has been replaced by the live rock/trickle filter combination as the best fil-
tration available. As I mentioned earlier, large amounts of live rock combined
with an external powerfilter or canister filter are used by many aquarists to
keep their aquariums in top running condition.
129
Chapter 7: Figuring Out Filters

If you really can’t afford a trickle filter, don’t want to get into live rock, or per-
haps you inherited your Uncle Greg’s old aquarium equipment, you can use
the undergravel filter system, but you should combine it with an external
powerfilter or canister filter. Ideally, powerheads or a reverse flow under-
gravel system is best if you decide to go this route.
Be mindful that the type of aquarium you intend to keep will also dictate the
kind of filtration you provide. The undergravel system noted above is fine
for the simple fish-only tank, but you should bite the monetary bullet and
invest in a more advanced system for any system that houses invertebrates
(reef tank). That’s because this type of aquarium requires the most efficient
filtration.
Regardless of the filtration system, always add a protein skimmer to your list
of essential aquarium components.
Aeration and Circulation
In Chapter 6, I discuss the needs of fish and invertebrates — one of these
needs is oxygen. The process in which you add oxygen to the water is called
aeration, pronounced “air-AY-tion.” Of course, you’re really just adding air to
the water, but when you do so, oxygen diffuses into the water, and your pets
love you for it. Aeration and circulation go hand in hand. Adding oxygen is
one thing, but it must be distributed throughout the tank. Circulation is par-
ticularly critical for reef tanks because it not only delivers oxygen but also
sweeps away wastes, delivers food, and helps the animals’ own internal 
circulation.
By keeping the water moving in the aquarium, you’re also evenly distributing
the temperature of the water. What good is a heater if it heats only one
corner of the tank? (See Chapter 8 for the lowdown on heaters.)
With the exception of live rock, most of the filter systems discussed in this
chapter aerate the water in some way, shape, or form. The undergravel
filter with venturi powerheads, for example, provides circulation and 
aeration. Input piping from a canister filter or trickle filter provides circula-
tion and some aeration. Additional circulation and aeration doesn’t hurt in
either case.
In contrast, live rock provides excellent filtration, but no circulation or aera-
tion. In fact, it is critically important that circulation and aeration be added to
keep live rock healthy and to maximize biological filtration.
130
Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium 

Air pumps and airstones
Although most filters provide water circulation and aeration to the
aquarium, it is a very good idea to have an external air pump moving air
through one or more airstones in the tank. An air pump increases cir-
culation in the tank, promotes oxygen exchange at the surface, and
increases the escape of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and free ammonia
from the tank. In addition, this increase in circulation acts to mix all the
aquarium levels so that a uniform temperature is maintained throughout
the tank.
There are two general air pump designs: the diaphragm type and the piston
type, both of which are shown in Figure 7-8. The diaphragm pump, also
known as the vibrator pump, is the more common of the two and generally
provides enough maintenance-free usage for most aquariums. It can, how-
ever, be a bit noisy. The piston pump, however, is more powerful and should
be used in larger aquariums, particularly if an undergravel filter and multiple
airstones need to be powered. In this air pump, air is generated with a piston
mechanism.
The size and power output of air pumps vary. Although many are meant
to correspond to the size of the aquarium, buy one based on what you’re
going to do with it. If you plan on powering a protein skimmer and an 
undergravel filter in your thirty-gallon tank, you need a high-capacity
air pump. However, this would not be the case if you simply want to 
run air to a mermaid ornament in your 90-gallon tank; you can buy a
smaller one.
An airstone, also known as an air diffuser, is generally made of porous stone
or perforated wood that allows air to pass through it, splitting the airstream
into tiny bubbles. Too fine a mist will cause bubbles to adhere to various tank
decorations and to fish. You want the bubbles to travel slowly to the surface
and agitate the water. Airstones come in a variety of sizes and shapes, and
the ones you choose depend on how much you need to aerate and on your
personal preference. Some airstones on the market today can create dra-
matic effects.
Be sure to keep a watchful eye on your airstones because they will degrade
and clog over time, making your air pump work harder and increasing wear
and tear. Airstones are relatively inexpensive, so replace them when the bub-
bles they generate become inconsistent.
131
Chapter 7: Figuring Out Filters

Your air pump and airstones will require air-line tubing to form the link
between the two. This is plastic or rubber tubing that delivers air from your
pump to the airstone. This should fit snugly at all joints so that air doesn’t
escape from the system. Air leaks reduce the efficiency of the system (filter,
airstone) and may ultimately burn out the pump.
Make sure the tubing is manufactured for use in the aquarium; other grades
may be toxic to fish. Also, air-line tubing will degrade over time, so if it starts
kinking or cracking, replace it to save your air pump and maintain the effi-
ciency of the air delivery.
If you intend to run multiple airstones or additional devices, like filters, from
a single pump, you need one or more air valves. These enable air flow to be
directed to multiple devices from a single pump. The use of several air valves
allows you to turn on and shut off devices as you see fit.

Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium 

Powerheads
Air pumps, tubing, and airstones are great for fish-only systems and well
suited to augment existing circulation from filter systems. However, reef
tanks with live rock and invertebrates really need a lot of circulation, and I
mean a lot of circulation. You already know from what I’ve written earlier that
powerheads improve the efficiency and performance of an undergravel filter,
as well as water circulation and aeration. But you don’t need an undergravel
filter to add powerheads to your aquarium.
If you plan on keeping a reef tank, powerheads are strongly recommended as
the best way to increase circulation and aeration. I suggest that aquarium
owners with tanks in excess of 50 gallons should use two powerheads, one in
each corner.
Making waves
The most conscientious reef aquarists use a wavemaker to increase circula-
tion in their aquariums. The rhythmic movement of water in the tank actually
simulates the motion of the ocean, creating a natural setting for the inverte-
brates in your aquarium. This is not an essential piece of equipment if you
have other kinds of equipment, such as powerheads and airstones, that circu-
late the water.

Heating and Lighting 
Your Aquarium
In This Chapter
 Maintaining the right temperature for your aquarium
 Examining heaters of all types
 Understanding light and why it’s important for fish and invertebrates
 Adding the right light to your aquarium
T
he oceans of the world are not uniform in temperature and light level. If
you’ve been to tropical areas like, for example, the Caribbean, you know
that the water is warmer, crystal clear, and bright with sunlight. In contrast,
waters off northern areas like New England are colder and darker. In these
natural environments, which differ dramatically, the animals living in each
of these regions are well adapted to temperature and light levels.
Most fish and invertebrates are cold-blooded animals. That means their body
temperatures are the same as the temperature of the waters in which they
live. In general, their bodies function best at specific water temperatures and,
therefore, all fishes have temperature preferences that depend on where they
originate.
Fishes can be grouped in general categories based in where they live and
water temperature. Temperate fishes include many species that inhabit
cooler northern waters. If you set up a coldwater aquarium, it will likely 
contain temperate fishes. These fishes are also well adapted to the low light
levels and shorter days in these areas.
However, the most common fishes in the marine aquarium are tropical coral
reef species. The term tropical refers to natural habitats where the waters are
warm throughout the year. It should come as no surprise, therefore, that you
must heat your aquarium water to a specific temperature range. This is the
job of an aquarium heater. This essential piece of equipment maintains your
aquarium water at a constant temperature, regardless of the room temperature.

Tropical Heat
In their natural home, tropical fishes typically experience few changes in tem-
perature. So, in your aquarium, you want to mimic the natural environment
and maintain as constant a temperature as possible.
If you live in a warm place, like Florida, year-round, you may be thinking
that you don’t need an aquarium heater. Not true. In Florida, the outside
air temperature isn’t always constant: It too fluctuates and this influences
water temperature. It creates problems for your pets if you don’t have an
aquarium heater because fluctuations of even a few degrees can stress your
animals and possibly kill them. This is further complicated if you have air
conditioning.
The Right Temperature
Tropical marine fish and invertebrate species require that the aquarium 
temperature be maintained at 75°F to 79°F. However, this range is entirely
dependent on the species you choose, so consult your local pet dealer or
one of the many fish encyclopedias (see Appendix A) for the temperature
requirements of your specific pet. Make sure that you don’t mix species that
have very different temperature preferences.
Temperature can be reported in either Fahrenheit (°F) or in Celsius (°C).
Don’t let this confuse you — it’s simply a difference in scale. Throughout this
book, I use Fahrenheit. If you want to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius,
simply apply the formula in Chapter 22.
Hot Parts
As you can expect, a lot of heaters are available on the market for today’s
home aquarium. Some designs are clearly better than others, but the most
popular aquarium heaters work off the same principles and have many parts
in common.
With the exception of some specialized heater designs that are relatively
uncommon, a basic aquarium heater looks like a big test tube with a
bunch of wiring in it and an electrical cord coming out of it. This wad of
136
Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium 

wiring is actually a heating coil contained in a glass tube that gets submerged
in your aquarium. (The extent to which it is submerged depends on the type
of heater.)
Of course, the heating coil has to be turned on and off, and this is the job of
the thermostat, the mechanism that usually dictates the quality of the heater.
You set the thermostat with the control knob, and an indicator light fires up
when the heater is operating.
Types of Heaters
Having mentioned the basic parts of a heater (in the preceding section), I can
more easily explain the differences between the various types to help you
choose the right one.
Hanging heaters
A hanging heater is also referred to as the clamp-on, clip-on, or semi-submersible
heater. This is the oldest style of aquarium heater and has been around since
my early aquarium days, way back in the ’70s. As you may expect, the hang-
ing heater is so named because it hangs on the upper part of the aquarium
clamped to the rim of the tank. The glass body of the heater is submerged
in the aquarium, but the controls remain out of the water.
Although these heaters are the least expensive, they also tend to be the most
primitive, and I don’t consider them to be the best choice for the saltwater
aquarium. First, their placement at the top of the water column is not the
most efficient location for heat exchange. This location also makes them
extremely vulnerable to being disturbed by both you and the tank’s inhabi-
tants. The more either of you bang into the heater, the higher the chance that
it will be damaged (the glass body can crack). These heaters also tend to
have less efficient thermostats for controlling their operation.
A damaged heater is a dangerous electrical appliance for all living things
near it. Remember, electricity and water don’t mix!
After you’ve made such a significant investment in your aquarium, don’t jeop-
ardize the success of the entire system by saving $20 on a cheap heater.
Many of your tank’s inhabitants are worth more than the amount you’ll save.
137
Chapter 8: Heating and Lighting Your Aquarium

Submersible heaters
A submersible heater (shown in Figure 8-1) is the preferred choice for the salt-
water aquarium. Also known as an immersion heater, the submersible heater
is placed fully in the aquarium in any location that you desire. This means
that you can put it near the bottom, out of the way of the aquarium’s inhabi-
tants, out of your view, and in a more efficient location for heat dispersion.
You can even put the submersible heater in the sump of your trickle filter
(see Chapter 7), keeping it completely out of the way of the aquarium.
In addition, most submersible heaters have advanced thermostat controls
that make temperature selection and control easier. Although glass was the
primary affordable heater option available, now there are unbreakable fully
submersible heaters made of titanium.

Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium 

Warm Options
Whether you choose a hanging heater or a submersible heater, look for the
following features.
Thermostat
The switch that controls the operation of your heater is the thermostat, and
it comes in a variety of styles. Most heaters have a built-in thermostat, but
others have a separate one. The external thermostat is placed on the side of
the tank or has a separate probe that’s placed in the water. Although this
style is not common, it offers excellent temperature control because it is elec-
tronic, and digital temperature displays are more accurate.
Bimetallic strip
The most common aquarium heater is regulated by a built-in thermostat.
Older models have a mechanical thermostat called the bimetallic strip. As
your aquarium cools, the strip contracts until the circuit is closed and the
heater is turned on. This system is the old workhorse of the heater thermo-
stat world, but it has flaws.
Bimetallic strips tend to lose efficiency with time and ultimately fail to func-
tion properly. If you do purchase a heater with a bimetallic strip thermostat,
be sure it has magnetic contacts. These close the circuit more effectively,
decreasing wear and tear on the unit.
139
Chapter 8: Heating and Lighting Your Aquarium
Avoid hot spots
Place your heater close to an area of high cir-
culation so that heated water can be rapidly and
evenly distributed throughout the tank. This is
usually near the filter system, the filter input
from an external filter, or the airstones (see
Chapter 7)
The fully submersible heater should be placed
at the bottom of the tank so that heating con-
vection can be optimized. The filter sump is also
a great place, because water is always moving
through it.

Electronic
Although heaters equipped with bimetallic strip thermostats tend to be
less expensive, heaters with electronic thermostats are better. An electronic
thermostat operates more efficiently than an older mechanical thermostat.
These units usually detect water temperature more accurately from the glass
body of the heater, instead of from the air inside the glass body. In addition,
more advanced electronic heaters are designed to fail in the “off” position, so
that your fish aren’t cooked if the heater has a problem. This gives you time
to detect the problem, which is why you want to keep a watchful eye on your
aquarium water temperature every day.
Temperature control
All heaters have some kind of temperature control that you use to set the
proper temperature. The knob that controls the operation of the heater is
closely related to the thermostat. I treat it separately because you use this
part of the heater to set its operation. Now, some heaters are user-friendly
and others aren’t.
Older style heaters with bimetallic strip thermostats have control knobs that
you use to set the temperature, but you need to calibrate it, using a ther-
mometer. Although a fancy-sounding word, calibrate really just means that
you set the heater to operate at a desired temperature, usually about 75°F.
How do you do that? After your tank is filled and long before you add ani-
mals, you place the heater in the tank and then plug it in. Your thermometer
will tell you the temperature, and you hope that it’s close to 75°F. If it’s cooler,
adjust the control knob just until the point that the heater turns on and the
indicator light is on. If the temperature is too high, adjust the knob until the
heater is off. Over the next several hours, repeat these steps until the temper-
ature stabilizes at 75°F. Perhaps you can see why these heaters aren’t very
convenient.
On the other hand, you can avoid having to calibrate the heater by buying
one of the more advanced electronic heaters. These units usually have a con-
trol knob that lets you select the desired temperature. Therefore, all you have
to do is set the control dial to 75°F without any adjustment.
I recommend that you double-check the temperature even with an electronic
heater after initially setting it up, just to be sure that it’s operating correctly.
140
Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium 

Thermal protection
Consider this: You’re putting a glass tube with electrical elements inside of it
into a tank full of water and a bunch of live animals. To most people, that
spells an accident waiting to happen. And believe me, any time you put
water and electricity together, you’re going to have an element of danger.
That’s why some protective options are available in heaters.
Fish are inquisitive creatures and are bound to investigate your heater. If the
heater is hanging an the side of the tank or just lying on the bottom, it’s only
a matter of time before it gets pushed into the wall of the tank or a piece of
coral — and cracks. Make it a point to buy a heater with suction cups, which
keep the heater in one location and buffer it from occasional strikes from
both you and your fish. If your heater doesn’t come with suction cups, pur-
chase them separately.
You can also protect the glass body of the heater itself. I know of at least one
manufacturer that markets a protective guard for the heater to protect both
the heater and the fish. Some heaters also have protective finishes on the
glass body of the heater. These protective coatings include titanium, ceramic,
Teflon, silicone, and even stainless steel. They may cost more, but the health
of your fish is worth it.
One Size Doesn’t Fit All
You may have selected a type of heater, but now you need to know what size
to buy. Size depends on a few factors.
Water and wattage
Aquarium heaters come in a variety of sizes based on their power output.
This is measured in wattage (just like light bulbs) and ranges from 25 to over
200 watts. It is extremely important to buy the right size heater for your
aquarium setup.
The general rule is five watts per gallon of water up to 50 gallons. Because
larger aquaria tend to hold heat better, three watts per gallon is enough
power for tanks greater than 50 gallons. So, for example, a 30-gallon tank
would require a 150-watt heater while a 60-gallon tank would require a 
180-watt heater.
141
Chapter 8: Heating and Lighting Your Aquarium

It’s not only the size of the aquarium that dictates the size of the heater.
You should also take into account how hard the heater has to work. In other
words, how cold is the room that the aquarium is in, and more importantly,
what’s the difference between the room temperature and the aquarium tem-
perature? For example, some folks prefer to keep their room temperature at
55°F, yet a tropical aquarium should be at 75°F. That means that the heater
must work to maintain the aquarium temperature 20°F above the room 
temperature. On the other hand, a warmer room would allow the heater to
work less.
With this in mind, some heater manufacturers and aquarists size the heater
not only to the aquarium, but also to this room-aquarium temperature dif-
ference. Basically, if your room temperature is just a little cooler than the
aquarium, you can buy a smaller heater than the general rule dictates. If your
room is much colder, you need to go bigger. Table 8-1 guides you through the
selection. For very large tanks in very cold rooms, I recommend two heaters,
and this is indicated by a (2) next to the wattage.

More than one
In Table 8-1, you see that larger tanks require more than one heater if the
room temperature difference is large. But you don’t need to have a large
room temperature difference to have two heaters. Here’s why: If your single
aquarium heater fails or malfunctions, your fish and invertebrates can poten-
tially die.
142
Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium 

If, however, you have two heaters, the other heater can pick up the slack if
one fails. I only recommend this for larger tanks because hiding one heater
can be difficult, let alone two.
If you opt for more than one heater, simply divide the recommended power
by two. For example, instead of a single 200W heater for a 55-gallon tank, you
can use two 100W heaters. You may want to put one in your aquarium and
one in your sump. A little backup heater power is a sound investment.
Depth and length
Aquarium heaters come in a variety of lengths ranging from 6 to 15 inches.
In general, heaters that are more powerful are longer. This is not a problem
for the fully submersible heater, but hanging types should be at least 3 inches
shorter than the tank height to account for gravel and other ornamentation.
Choosing a Thermo Meter
Of course, I mean a thermometer, but you should think of it as something that
measures the amount of heat in your aquarium, hence a thermo meter. This is
an essential piece of equipment that I recommend even if your electronic
heater has a temperature probe or sensor. A standard thermometer is a
minor investment that assures you that your heater is operating properly.
A number of kinds are on the market today, and some are more accurate than
others.

Chapter 8: Heating and Lighting Your Aquarium
A word of caution
As with all electrical components, please
handle your heater with extreme care. Don’t
plug your heater in until it is submersed in water
regardless of what kind of heater it is. A hot
heater will readily burn you, can potentially start
a fire, and will crack if you suddenly submerse
it in cool water. As a matter of course, keep all
your electrical components unplugged until the
tank is completely set up and full.
Conversely, never remove your heater from the
aquarium unless it’s unplugged. Also allow it to
cool even after unplugging it before you take it
out of the water.

Floating thermometer
This style has been around for decades. It floats in the aquarium, but tends to
wander about in the currents if it’s not restrained in one area. Finding and
reading a floating thermometer can be a hassle, particularly if you have to lift
the hood (see Chapter 6) to retrieve it.
Sticking thermometer
Just like a floating thermometer, but it has a suction cup that adheres it to the
inside glass of the aquarium. A bit easier to read, but it’s something for your
fish to play with.
Hanging thermometer
This glass thermometer attached to a stainless steel bracket that hangs on
the inside of your aquarium. It stays in place, but may interfere with your
aquarium hood and, again, is something for your fish to bump into.
Sinking thermometer
This is really just a floating thermometer that’s weighted and sinks to the
bottom. It drifts about the aquarium if not secured and provides a toy for
your fish, and this is not good.
144
Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium 
Hot tip
This chapter covers a lot of heater options for
your aquarium. When in doubt, don’t be afraid
to buy a little larger unit than you need. A heater
more powerful than you need won’t hurt, but
one that’s too small won’t be able to keep up.
Thermometers are inexpensive (less than $2), so
buy a couple, perhaps a liquid crystal stick-on
and a floating or hanging type. The latter can be
kept out of the aquarium and used to double-
check the temperature or to check the temper-
ature of water that you’re adding to the tank.
Ideally, a digital thermometer is the best, but the
added expense (more than $15) may not be in
your budget.

Thermometer-hydrometer
This is a thermometer that’s inside your hydrometer and floats in the aquar-
ium. The hydrometer is used to measure the amount of salt in your water.
This is called salinity. I discuss salinity and hydrometers in Chapter 9.
Liquid crystal thermometer
This thermometer sticks to glass wall of your aquarium on the outside.
There’s nothing for your tank inhabitants to interfere with, and they are very
easy to read but not as accurate as other thermometers. After one is in place,
it is difficult to move.
Digital thermometer
A bit more expensive, but a digital thermometer provides electronic accu-
racy. These are external units that have a temperature probe that goes into
the tank. Most also tell you room temperature, and some have a built-in alarm
that alerts you when the temperature is too hot or too cold.
Temperature controller
This is a very expensive unit that integrates with a heater and actually controls
your aquarium water temperature electronically. These are best for extremely
large systems and are not essential for you as a basic home aquarist.
Let There Be Lighting
When you think of the tropics, what comes to mind? Bright sunshine and
crystal-clear, warm, turquoise waters teeming with colorful living creatures,
right?
Well, sunshine, clear waters, and colorful creatures go hand in hand. In the
tropical waters of the world, the water is clear, and sunlight is able to pene-
trate deeper than in more northern temperate waters. Over time, this allowed
for coral reefs to develop in the areas with the right combination of light and
water depth. And with the coral reefs came a huge diversity of invertebrates
and fishes.
145
Chapter 8: Heating and Lighting Your Aquarium

Did you ever notice that where there is no intense light, there is no coral?
Coral isn’t a plant. It’s an invertebrate animal that actually houses tiny plant-
like organisms in its body that feed it. Therefore, corals need light and a lot of
it. Tropical fish need light as well, but not as much of it. They need to see
what they eat, and their lives are adapted to changes in light intensity over
the course of a day and over the course of a year.
Daily changes in light dictate rest periods for fish. A diurnal fish is active
during the day and rests at night, and a nocturnal fish does the opposite.
In addition, monthly changes in light intensity stimulate spawning in many
tropical reef fishes and invertebrates. So light is extremely important in the
natural environment.
Now, here’s the challenge: Bring enough light into your aquarium so that your
reef creatures live and act naturally. Is it possible? Yes. Even though it’s
highly unlikely that you’ll get them to spawn, you will be able to mimic 
natural lighting so that they resume their diurnal or nocturnal habits.
Oh, by the way, a light in your aquarium is good for you as well your fish.
What good is an aquarium if you can’t see what’s in it?
By definition, light is electromagnetic energy from the sun that’s measured in
wavelengths. The light that we are able to see is composed of many wave-
lengths that fall into what is called the visible light spectrum. Visible light
with the longest wavelength is red. Light with wavelengths longer than this
visible light is called infrared, but you can’t see it without special equipment.
As visible light wavelengths decrease, the colors change from red to orange,
yellow, green, blue, and violet. Light with wavelengths shorter than this is
called ultraviolet (UV), and you can’t see it either. UV light can also be damag-
ing to your skin and your eyes.
Before I’m through boring you to tears, I want to add one more bit of knowl-
edge to this physics lesson. The shorter the wavelength of light, the deeper
it penetrates in the ocean. Therefore, blue and violet light goes the deepest
while red and yellow light are filtered out quickly by the properties of water.
This is called light attenuation, and fish and invertebrates have adapted quite
well to it.
What does all this have to do with aquarium lighting? Well, it turns out that
reef invertebrates, like coral, are very dependent on short wavelength light
such as blue, violet, and even ultraviolet. This light is very important because
these animals have photosynthetic algae living in them. These algae are called
zooxanthellae, and they are able to take wastes from the coral, harness the
energy of the sun, and convert it to energy for their host. What does that tell
you? If you plan on having a reef aquarium, you need to increase the intensity
of your lighting and include light from the blue side of the spectrum.
146
Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium 

Fish, on the other hand, don’t have such special needs for high-intensity
lighting. Thus, a fish-only marine aquarium shouldn’t have high intensity
lighting because it promotes excessive growth of algae in the tank, and most
fish don’t prefer it.
Fishy Fixtures
Aquarium lighting comes in two general types of fixtures: strip lights and hang-
ing spotlights. Strip lights are simply long lighting fixtures that are either built
into your aquarium hood, sit on top of your glass canopy, or hang suspended
over your tank. A good example of a strip light is the standard fluorescent
hood fixture. Most hanging fixtures are high-intensity lights that generate a
lot of heat and can’t be kept on top of the aquarium. Dome-shaped hanging
fixtures are called pendants, and they deliver a concentrated spot of light. 
Because aquarium fixtures come in a variety of styles, it’s a good idea to make
your choice when you plan your aquarium. The type of lighting you choose
depends on your tank’s inhabitants and the visual effects you want to achieve.
For example, high-intensity lamps that hang above your aquarium will create
a much different lighting effect than a standard hood fixture that distributes
even lighting. It will look like sunlight rippling through clear tropical waters,
creating a truly dramatic natural look. However, if you’re going to go with this
type of lighting, you really don’t want to buy a full plastic aquarium hood (see
Chapter 6). Instead, use a glass canopy.
147
Chapter 8: Heating and Lighting Your Aquarium
Watt is power
The intensity or power of a light bulb is mea-
sured in watts. Depending on the type of light,
aquarium lighting can be as powerful as 400
watts.
Although power is rated in watts, the color of
light is rated in degrees Kelvin. I’m not going to
get into the specifics of why, because I think
you’ve had enough physics already. Suffice to
say that aquarium bulbs can range from 5,400°K
to 20,000°K, and the greater the number, the
more blue light is produced.
Typical reef aquarium lighting is about 10,000°K
because it produces a lot of blue light. I tell you
this because when you’re shopping for light
bulbs, you’ll encounter these numbers.
Another specialized term that you will undoubt-
edly encounter is actinic lighting. Actinic light
bulbs produce light at the blue end of the spec-
trum, near UV light. They are ideal for corals and
other photosynthetic invertebrates, but they
aren’t full-spectrum bulbs, so additional lighting
may be needed.

Lighting the Way
You can find a number of choices for lighting your aquarium. In this section,
I run through your options and give you an idea of the benefits of each type,
including the qualities of the lighting, the initial expense, the amount of elec-
tricity a unit consumes, and the life of the bulb.
Natural light
Although natural sunlight is an ideal source of light for your aquarium, it is
also the most difficult to harness in the right quantities. It certainly is inex-
pensive, and it does provide the entire spectrum of wavelengths, called 
full-spectrum light. Nonetheless, direct sunlight is difficult to control, it’s not
predictable, and therefore, it’s not a logical source of aquarium light.
Tungsten
If you started with a 10-gallon freshwater setup a few years back, you may
have had an incandescent light on top of it. This is also called tungsten 
lighting. The typical light bulb in your living room lamp provides tungsten
light.
 Quality of light: Incandescent lights burn hot, they don’t provide full-
spectrum lighting, and they promote the growth of nuisance algae.
 Bulb longevity: Tungsten light bulbs don’t last long and require frequent
changing.
 Expense: The initial cost of these units is low, but they consume a lot of
electricity.
 Recommendation: Not for the saltwater aquarium.
Fluorescent
Considered by many to provide the optimum lighting for the aquarium, fluo-
rescent lighting is popular for saltwater aquariums. If you think that you’re
unfamiliar with fluorescent lighting, think again. It’s very common in commer-
cial office buildings, and we’ve all seen it and used it in our everyday lives.
There was a time when the same type of lighting was used in the aquarium,
but times and technologies have changed.
148
Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium 

Now, fluorescent lights are made specifically for saltwater aquariums. If you
choose this type of lighting, make sure to buy it from your fish dealer. These
fixtures usually come as full hood aquarium lights or may be purchased sepa-
rately as a strip lights for glass canopies. (See Chapter 6 for more on hoods
and canopies.)
 Quality of light: Fluorescent fixtures produce cool, bright light that
spreads evenly from the light into the aquarium. This doesn’t allow for
natural surface ripple effects, but it does distribute light evenly in the
tank. Fluorescent bulbs or tubes come in a wide variety of choices and
power outputs. Full-spectrum lighting is available and ideal for reef
tanks (discussed in Chapter 1). Multi-bulb fixtures are available so that
light of different spectral qualities can be mixed. Fluorescent lighting is
also pleasing to the eye.
 Bulb longevity: Fluorescent tubes generally retain their spectral quali-
ties until they fail. They are known to last from several months to two
years, depending on the bulb.
 Expense: Initial cost is less expensive than other aquarium lighting, they
operate very efficiently, and they consume relatively low amounts of
electricity.
 Recommendation: Excellent lighting for fish-only tanks and some kinds
of reef tanks.
Power compact fluorescent
This type of lighting is really just a U-shaped fluorescent tube instead of a
straight tube. However, they have a much higher light output than a standard
fluorescent fixture. Power compact fluorescent lights are sold as strip lights,
or you may purchase a retrofit kit for a standard hood.
 Quality of light: These fixtures have the same benefits of standard fluo-
rescent lights, but they produce higher intensity lighting. Full-spectrum
and specialty lighting are available and work well for deeper reef tanks.
Multi-bulb fixtures are available so that light of different spectral quali-
ties can be mixed. Like fluorescent lighting, power compact is also pleas-
ing to the eye.
 Bulb longevity: Power compact fluorescent tubes also retain their spec-
tral qualities until they fail. They are known to last from several months
to two years, depending on the bulb.
 Expense: Initial cost is more expensive than standard fluorescent light-
ing, but they operate more efficiently and consume less electricity.
 Recommendation: Excellent lighting for reef tanks.
149
Chapter 8: Heating and Lighting Your Aquarium

Mercury vapor
This lighting uses mercury vapor to produce light from spotlights suspended
above the aquarium.
 Quality of light: These fixtures provide spotlighting, which can create
dramatic natural visual effects with water rippling. Although intense,
the spectral quality of the light is lacking on the blue side of the spec-
trum, so they’re not good for reef tanks without additional lighting.
These lights produce heat, so they need to be ventilated.
 Bulb longevity: Can be quite short with a significant loss of efficiency in
less than six months. Bulbs need to be replaced frequently.
 Expense: Expensive to purchase and operate.
 Recommendation: Good for deeper saltwater tanks but not for reef
tanks without additional blue lighting.
Metal halide
Like mercury vapor lighting, metal halide lights produce powerful spotlight-
ing that penetrates deep and produces dramatic visual effects. Metal
halide light bulbs look like standard light bulbs on steroids. Metal halide
lighting is available in hanging lamps, hanging pendants, or ventilated
canopy fixtures.
 Quality of light: Provides intense, deep-penetrating, full-spectrum light
that’s ideal for invertebrate tanks. Bulbs that favor the blue side of the
spectrum are available for special reef lighting.
The lights need to be suspended above the aquarium and ventilated
because they run hot. Because they may produce ultraviolet light, they
can be damaging to the human eye, so take care around them.
 Bulb longevity: Need to be replaced every eight to twelve months to
maintain maximum efficiency.
 Expense: Expensive to purchase and operate.
 Recommendation: Ideal for reef and invertebrate tanks.
150
Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium 

Combination
It is now possible to purchase lighting systems that offer a combination of
lighting types. Most of these are offered as light strip fixtures that sit above
your aquarium. The most common are metal halide fluorescent fixtures that
include multiple light sources.
Although expensive, these systems offer the best of both worlds: high inten-
sity light for photosynthetic invertebrates and soft fluorescent lighting for
pleasant viewing.
Switching from Day to Night
An often overlooked component to a lighting system is also one of the most
critical: the on/off time switch. Tropical marine fish and invertebrates come
from regions where day length ranges from 10 to 15 hours, so you can’t
expect your pets to be exposed to 24 hours of light. Remember, some animals
are diurnal and some are nocturnal, so you really need to simulate day and
night in your aquarium.
An inexpensive automatic timer will turn your lighting system on and off at
the same time so that a consistent day length can be maintained. A 10-to 
12-hour day is generally recommended for most aquariums.
Consider making an effort not to startle your fish with the sudden switching
of lights. In nature, the sun doesn’t drop like a rock, so neither should the one
in your aquarium. You can mimic a more natural sunset and sunrise in a
couple of different ways.
First, if you have more than one lighting fixture, you can have another auto-
matic timer. Stagger the timing of the lights so that one shuts off and turns on
about an hour before the other. If you don’t have more than one light fixture,
control the lighting in the room, instead. Simply put room lights on automatic
timers or control them yourself so that lighting changes gradually. This little
detail helps keep your fish happy and, therefore, healthy.

n the wilds of the ocean, the name of the game is Eat or Be Eaten. Most of
the small fish and invertebrates that you keep in your aquarium are the
ones that often end up on the short end of the stick. In nature, these little
critters are always wary of potential predators.
The coral reef ecosystem, however, provides hiding places, caves, and nooks
for protection. Many species of fish even set up small territories that they
defend. Thus rocks, sand, plants, macro-algae, and coral reefs are important
structures that fish and invertebrates need to survive.
When you introduce your aquatic guests to their new home, they will
undoubtedly be looking for the same nooks and caves they left behind. To
make them feel comfortable and keep them healthy, you need to decorate
and aquascape (underwater landscape).
Your new pets need clean water, oxygen, heat, light, and housing. But there are a
few loose odds and ends to buy in order to get your new aquarium up and run-
ning. In this chapter, I discuss the basics of what you need to get your aquarium
up and running and keep it running. That includes little things that you need on
a daily basis to keep your aquarium clean and to take care of your new pets.

154
Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium 
Almost everything that you place in your aquarium, from gravel to cleaning
equipment, can and will influence your water chemistry. That influence may
be either positive or negative. Anything that contains toxic compounds, such
as heavy metals, will negatively impact your water chemistry and potentially
harm your pets. Throughout this chapter, I tell you how to avoid adding toxic
compounds to your tank with each of your fishy furnishing.
Aqua-Décor Is a Matter of Taste
Just how you aquascape (that is, underwater landscape) your saltwater
aquarium is entirely up to you as long as you take into account the following
basic rules:
 Don’t put anything into the tank unless you’re positively sure it won’t
harm your fish. The best way to ensure this is to avoid collecting your
own decorations. Buy them instead from a reputable dealer.
 Make an effort to give your aquarium creatures some creature comforts,
such as caves and crannies.
 Don’t overstuff your aquarium with decorations. The most important
element in the tank is water. Every piece of rock or coral you put in the
tank will displace water and space, and your pets need both. In general,
cover only about 50 to 60 percent of the bottom of your tank.
 Stick with calcareous ornamentation whenever possible. This just means
that the decorations are calcium-based, such as coral and dolomite. This
will help stabilize the chemistry of the water, which needs to be alkaline.
I talk more about this issue in Chapter 13.
 When you stack rocks and other ornamentation, make sure the structure
is stable. Rocks, by definition, are heavy, and you don’t want one chang-
ing the décor in your living room, if you know what I mean. A good rule
is to make the base of structure as wide as it is high.
 Take the time before you buy to design the décor of your aquarium. Sit
down with a pencil and paper and draw it. Get creative, pulling ideas
from books and public displays, and then try to make it a reality.
The Natural Look
There is no such thing as a typical freshwater-aquarium look because so
many kinds of ornaments, gravel, plants, and weird toys are available to suit
the many tastes out there. Remember the kid next door who had the purple
gravel, bubbling skeleton, and plastic plants? Must have been the ’70s.

On the other hand, the norm for the saltwater aquarium is the natural look.
As you may expect, I’m a true believer in the use of natural-looking ornamen-
tation. The use of corals, rocks, and dolomite not only looks good, it also
helps water chemistry and gives your fish a more natural setting.
Most freshwater decorations are simply not for the marine aquarium. Of
course, if your child wants to put a ceramic skin diver in the tank, go ahead
and have some fun.
Some Background Material
I don’t know about you, but if I didn’t have a background on the back of my
tank, my guests would see not only all my aquarium wiring and tubing but
also the wall behind it (which needs painting very badly).
The aquarium background masks these poor views and also provides a pleas-
ing backdrop to the beauty of your aquarium inhabitants. I’ve always felt that
the ideal aquarium background is one that blends with the aquarium and
155
Chapter 9: Fishy Furnishings and Finishing Touches
A word on conservation
Marine fish, invertebrates, live rock, and corals
are harvested from the wild largely for the
marine aquarium trade. Much of it comes from
Pacific islands with small, rural, low-income
areas that have few options for employment.
Without proper management, these areas
become quickly overharvested, and a great deal
of natural habitat is destroyed. This doesn’t
happen everywhere, but the extent of the
damage is really not known.
The marine aquarium trade is a billion-dollar
industry that has a vested interest in staying
alive. That’s why industry leaders, conserva-
tionists, and dealers from around the world got
together in 1998 to form the Marine Aquarium
Council (www.aquariumcouncil.org).
The primary goal of this important international
body is to transform the marine industry into one
that’s based on quality and sustainability. If all
goes according to plan, you’ll be able to walk
into your dealer and buy a piece of live rock or
a fish and know that it was harvested properly
and in a way that didn’t impact the natural
ecosystem.
But the Marine Aquarium Council is a little ways
off from getting to this level of control. In the
meantime, the best thing you can do to insure
that your aquarium isn’t set up at the expense
of a piece of nature is to buy from a reputable
dealer. In the United States, you can find sev-
eral member associations of the Marine
Aquarium Council. One of them is the American
Marinelife Dealers Association (www.amda
reef.com). If your dealer is a member, there’s
a good chance that he or she is reputable. Don’t
be afraid to reach out and contact any of these
organizations to find out what you can do to
keep your aquarium thriving without upsetting
Mother Nature.

becomes barely noticeable. The wrong background pulls attention away from
your pets. I tend to lean toward a darker background because it highlights
the colors in the tank.
Simply paint
The least complicated background that I’ve seen is a paint job. That’s right,
many aquarists paint the rear wall of their aquariums to give them a uniform,
if underwhelming, appearance. This is not a bad idea if the right color is
chosen, but these backgrounds are somewhat permanent and don’t lend
themselves to spontaneous change. I’ve seen black and dark blue painted
backgrounds, and both can be pleasing to the eye.
It should go without saying that if you paint, paint the outside of the glass.
Paint in aquarium water would be a chemical disaster for your critters.
Stick-ons
The most common backgrounds used today are taped or self-stuck to the
back of the tank. Underwater scenes, solid colors, or mirrored foil backdrops
are available at every aquarium dealer. These can be purchased precut or cut
from a big wrapping-paper-style roll to fit your tank.
You can either tape one of these to the back of the tank or buy one that’s self-
sticking. I prefer the former because I like to have the option of changing my
tastes. Many of these backgrounds are two-sided so that you can reverse
them when you want a change of scenery.
Dioramas
The most elaborate background involves the construction of a diorama
behind the tank. This is basically a box behind the tank that has natural
aquarium decorations and lighting. It’s an extension of the aquarium without
water in it. This gives your aquarium a remarkable 3-D effect that looks very
natural. Dioramas are usually custom built or result from do-it-yourself
endeavors. For this reason, they tend to be more expensive than the average
aquarium background.
156
Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium 

Unravel the Gravel
The best place to start when furnishing the inside of your aquarium is liter-
ally from the ground up. The “ground” in the aquarium is called the substrate
and is generally composed of gravel. Some experts prefer not to use any sub-
strate, but I don’t subscribe to that method. There’s substrate in the ocean,
and I think it belongs in the aquarium.
Unlike the gravel in a freshwater aquarium, the gravel in the saltwater tank
must be of a specific type. Just as you use calcareous decorations in your
marine aquarium, which act to keep the alkalinity in the aquarium high, your
gravel should do the same. Calcareous gravels have proven to be the most
suitable substrate for the marine aquarium. These include coral gravel, arag-
onite, and crushed oyster shell. They all contain carbonate which helps
“buffer” the seawater and maintain pH levels.
Before using your gravel, make it a point to give it a rinse in fresh water. If
possible, do this outside where it’s easier. Simply place the gravel in a bucket
and run water into it, mixing the gravel with your hands. The water will be
cloudy gray for a while, then gradually clear up. The gravel doesn’t have to
be spotless, but this rinsing removes a lot of the dust and dirt.
Dolomite and aragonite are some of the most common substrates for the salt-
water aquarium. Dolomite, which is named after the French mineralogist
Deodat de Dolomieu, is found in massive beds several hundred feet thick
throughout the world. Aragonite is similar to dolomite, but it lacks magne-
sium. It’s named after the place where it was discovered: Aragon, Spain.
It’s alive!
A close relative of live rock (see the “Live rock” section in this chapter) is live
sand. Of course, this doesn’t mean that the sand is moving, but it’s alive with
literally millions of little critters, including helpful bacteria. Live sand is good
to add to your saltwater aquarium because it brings important bacteria to
the system.
A layer of live sand over your gravel will help you establish a healthy aquar-
ium. Be careful if you have an undergravel filter because the sand will eventu-
ally move through the gravel and will probably clog your filter.
157
Chapter 9: Fishy Furnishings and Finishing Touches

Grain size
The grain size of your gravel is important and depends on your choice of fil-
tration. If you decide to filter your aquarium with a traditional undergravel
filter (see Chapter 7), your choice of gravel is critical. Remember, this sub-
strate will also be working as your filter media, so it must be the right size.
The name of the game is surface area, and gravel that’s between 1⁄8 and 1⁄4 inch
has a lot of it. Grains that are any smaller will clog your filter, whereas grains
much bigger will trap debris and also clog your filter.
If you don’t have an undergravel filter, you can use finer gravel or sand. These
finer substrates are great for invertebrate tanks and reef tanks because they
allow these little critters to burrow, which actually helps keep the substrate
clean.
Depth
How much gravel you use depends on whether or not you have an under-
gravel filter. The general rule for undergravel filters is 1 to2 inches of gravel.
Some aquarists recommend the use of two sizes of gravel (fine gravel on top,
of coarse) separated by a plastic mesh or gravel tidy. This may allow for filtra-
tion while minimizing the amount of substrate that can become clogged. The
gravel tidy also protects the filter from burrowing tank inhabitants.
If your filter system does not include an undergravel filter, you don’t need to
build a thick layer of gravel. In this case, a thin layer of 1⁄2 to 1 inch is all that
is necessary. If you decide to use a thicker layer of gravel (2 inches) for bur-
rowing invertebrates and fish, you need to occasionally stir the gravel (with a
plastic rod) because it traps and harbors waste, thereby creating water qual-
ity problems in your aquarium.
Determining how much gravel to buy depends, of course, on the size and shape
of your aquarium. A good place to start is about 1 to 2 pounds per gallon.
Buy a bit of extra gravel so that when you aquascape your tank, you have suf-
ficient amounts to sculpture the bottom and provide some contouring.
Getting Rocked
After you’ve done the groundwork, it’s time to get creative. Your choices at this
point depend on the kind of marine aquarium you’re planning. For example,
158
Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium 

live rock may not be suitable for some fish-only aquariums because some
species eat the inhabitants on the rock. Also, standard fish medications may
kill the rock. Therefore, many fish-only aquariums typically have dead coral,
tufa rock, or lava rock.
On the other hand, a reef tank, by definition, has live invertebrates, including
live corals and live rocks. This doesn’t mean that you can’t use other kinds of
rocks, too. Oh, to the contrary, other rocks are usually used to build a foun-
dation for the reef. You don’t want to pile live rocks on top of live rocks if
you’re building a nice terrace. There are other rocks for that.
Dead rock
Some people think they can go outside, dig around, and find some rocks for
the aquarium. Not true! Please don’t do this. Depending on where you live,
the rocks around your house may be high in metals and, therefore, dangerous
for your pets.
Plus, a chunk of granite is not exactly what I call a natural-looking saltwater
decoration, on earth, at least. Some people find slate attractive in the aquar-
ium, but it’s heavy and should rest on the aquarium bottom and not just on
top of the gravel.
Tufa
Tufa is a natural addition to your aquarium that’s composed of calcium car-
bonate and is, therefore, good for your water chemistry. Tufa is calcareous
rock that’s soft, porous, and easy to mold. It’s ideal for a fish-only or reef tank
because you can shape it, and algae and invertebrates readily colonize it. It’s
lightweight and porous, so it doesn’t displace a lot of water. Tufa is a nice
addition to any tank.
Lava rock
This is not real lava rock, and that’s good because volcanic lava is high in
metals and toxic to your aquarium. Instead, lava rock is an attractive man-
made material that, like the tufa, is light with low volume displacement; it too
becomes readily colonized by algae, invertebrates, and other beneficial crit-
ters (like bacteria). Although it can be expensive, lava rock is easy to handle
and stacks well if you decide to build a centerpiece or terrace.

Live rock
I’m not talking about putting a rock and roll concert in your tank. This is
really not the best name for this type of rock because it’s not actually alive.
Live rock does, however, provide a home for all kinds of small living sea life,
from bacteria to starfish. So it could be called “rock with living things on it,”
but that would be tough to market.
Live rock is not only an excellent decoration for your aquarium, it is also a
natural filter that many aquarists use as their primary means of keeping their
aquarium healthy. I discuss the use of live rock as a filter in Chapter 7. By
keeping live rock, you kill two birds with one rock by providing natural décor
and filtration.
Live rock is coral rubble or reef rock that’s carpeted with living material. It’s
either collected from wild areas, such as Fiji and Tonga in the Pacific, or culti-
vated in Florida or other areas. In the United States, it’s illegal to harvest live
rocks from U.S. waters, but it can be cultured.
The cultured live rock is less damaging to natural reef systems, but some con-
sider wild Pacific rock to be higher quality because it’s lighter, is typically
over 80 percent covered with algae, is commonly sold as branches or slabs,
and its color ranges from orange to purple.
What’s alive?
A lot of people, including me, talk about live rock and say “Oh, it’s covered
with a lot of critters.” What does that mean? In Chapters 4 and 14, I discuss
invertebrates and algae in more detail, but here’s a small list of the kinds of
life that can be found on live rock:
 Bacteria
 Many kinds of algae
 Corals
 Sponges
 Snails
 Clams
 Bryozoans
 Sea squirts
 Crabs
160
Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium 

 Barnacles
 Shrimps
 Starfish
 Worms
Although most of these critters are great for the tank, some, such as mantis
shrimp and bristle worms, can be a problem. I discuss solutions to these
problems in Chapter 4.
Fancy or just the base-ics
Live rock is sold in a couple of different forms based on its quality. Less
expensive live rock is often referred to as base rock and as the name implies,
it’s used as the foundation or bottom layer of the mini-reef in your aquarium.
Base rock looks pretty barren, but it has a lot of helpful bacteria.
Decorative live rock is the expensive stuff. This is the live rock that has the
most life (critters) on it. Depending on who is marketing it, higher quality live
rock may be called fancy rock, decorator rock, algae rock, premium rock, or
reef rock.
Cured and uncured
You can purchase live rock that’s either cured or uncured, and the definition
of this sometimes depends on the source. When live rock is harvested from
the wild or from a cultivator, it’s handled many times and in many ways
before it gets to you. During this process, some of the life on the rock is going
to die, and this simply can’t be avoided. When a piece of live rock is cured,
it’s held in a facility at some point until dead and dying critters are cleared
away by natural and man-made processes. Uncured live rock is harvested
and shipped without this process.
Many live rock dealers sell both cured and uncured products, but the extent
to which the live rock is cured differs among dealers. For example, some
claim to cure the rock for six weeks in a holding pen, whereas others do so
with salt spray. All claim to have the best method for removing dead or harm-
ful critters.
My recommendations are as follows:
 Live rock that has been cured at your local trustworthy dealer for sev-
eral weeks is best.
 If you’re going to have cured live rock shipped to you directly by a
dealer, don’t add it to an established aquarium without curing it again in
a separate tank (see the following section for details).
161
Chapter 9: Fishy Furnishings and Finishing Touches

 If you just set up your aquarium for the first time, add cured live rock
from the dealer and essentially cure it again in your aquarium.
 Live rock should only be added a little at a time, no more than 10 pounds
at a time. The amount of live rock should not exceed 1 to 1.5 pounds per
gallon, so that the aquarium isn’t overwhelmed.
Is there a cure?
If you didn’t buy live rock from a local dealer that had time to cure it, you’re
going to have to cure it yourself. Some people call this cycling or seeding the
live rock. I recommend that you do your curing in a tank separate from your
main display aquarium. Many aquarists have another isolation or quarantine
tank for dealing with isolating new fish and invertebrates, treating animals
that are sick, and curing live rock. This doesn’t need to be a complicated
setup, but the separate tank should have basic filtration, a protein skimmer,
and some lighting. If you’re establishing your main aquarium for the first
time, new live rock can be cured right in the main aquarium.
As with most topics in the ever-changing aquarium hobby, how to cure your
live rock is a matter of debate. The traditional method involves first removing
dead critters with a small brush and then isolating the rock for two to four
weeks in a separate tank with no lighting. Monitor the water chemistry,
aerate the water, and frequently clean the protein skimmer. This traditional
method may allow dead organisms to cycle through the tank, but the condi-
tions stress the living organisms.
The more advanced method of curing live rock involves exposing the rock to
low levels of actinic light and slowly increasing the amount of light. The
actinic lighting allows photosynthetic organisms to thrive but doesn’t pro-
vide enough light to promote the overgrowth of algae. This method requires a
protein skimmer, other filtration, and regular water changes (20 to 50 percent
every day). Start the light at six hours per day and increase by an hour every
two days until 12 hours is reached. Monitor water chemistry daily by con-
ducting standard water tests (see Chapter 12) and slowly introduce regular
lighting when ammonia and nitrite levels are undetectable.
When the rock is adapted to normal lighting, the curing process is complete,
and you can transfer the live rock to the main tank, if not already there. This
process still takes two to four weeks, but your rock will emerge much healthier.
Keeping Coral
By far, the most popular decoration for a tropical marine aquarium is coral
and artificial coral replicas. These structures give the aquarium a natural
look and provide excellent shelter for tank inhabitants and ideal substrate for
162
Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium 

algae (see Chapter 14). Real coral and other calcareous objects like shells
also provide the added benefit of buffering the water for pH maintenance (see
Chapter 13).
Coral is an animal with a calcium carbonate skeleton that lives in a colony of
millions, forming large reefs. In a natural coral reef ecosystem, the outermost
layer of the reef is the living coral colony. As the reef grows, layers are added
extremely slowly, taking hundreds of years to establish. Because of this,
efforts must be made to protect coral reef systems, and live reefs shouldn’t
be harvested without care and concern for nature.
Dead heads
The skeletal remains of coral are ideal for both fish-only and reef aquariums.
These can be purchased at many aquarium dealers or collected at the shore
of many tropical areas. Dead coral collected at the shore is perfectly suitable
for the aquarium after it has been properly cleaned.
I recommend that you boil all dead coral regardless of where you get it before
putting it your aquarium.
Most coral that you purchase will be bleached white. In a natural setting and
in a well balanced aquarium, this will not last. Colonization by algae will add
green and brown to the coral, diminishing its sterile look. While some begin-
ners find this “dirty” look unappealing, be assured that it is more natural
looking (see Chapter 14 for more about algae). In fact, coral that’s bleached
white in the wild is unhealthy and should be avoided.
The occasional removal of algae by boiling is recommended if its growth
becomes excessive and unsightly.
Artificial
One of the alternatives to dead coral is artificial coral replicas. These are
becoming increasingly popular and readily available as coral reef protection
is increasing worldwide. These natural-looking synthetics are safe for the
aquarium, come in a variety of colors, and provide the same benefits as real
coral with the exception of water buffering.
Many large commercial aquariums utilize artificial corals to mimic the natural
reef ecosystem. After the coral is overgrown with algae, the artificial coral is
virtually indistinguishable from the real thing. Most importantly, fish can’t tell
the difference. The coral replica is clearly the best choice for the environment.
163
Chapter 9: Fishy Furnishings and Finishing Touches

Some say that replica coral fixtures are expensive. When you compare them
to both live and dead coral, you’ll find that they actually cost less. Besides,
coral replicas can’t die.
Live coral
You’ve likely seen beautiful photos of saltwater aquariums teeming with life
including live coral. These are reef tanks, and live corals are very common
aquarium inhabitants that act as both pets and decorations. Because live
coral is an invertebrate, I discuss it extensively in Chapter 4.
Adding Inverts
Many other invertebrate species act as natural decorations for a reef aquar-
ium. Like coral, they are pets and furnishings at the same time. Clams,
sponges, anemones, and sea cucumbers are just a few examples of inverte-
brates that add a lot of beauty to a reef aquarium. I talk more about these ani-
mals in Chapter 4 because they’re more like pets than decorations.
Shells are popular natural additions to the saltwater aquarium. Be sure to
boil shells before using them in your tank, however. Sea fans and sea whips
provide plant-like decoration to the aquarium but must be soaked to expose
the black skeleton before use.
Providing Plants
Although real plants are pretty common in the freshwater aquarium, they are
somewhat rare in saltwater tanks. This is because, with few exceptions, most
of the ocean’s plant life can be classified in the primitive group known as
algae. The term seaweed actually refers to the many-celled forms of algae
called macro-algae. Macro-algae are common in reef tanks and generally come
with live rock. In a fish-only tank, macro-algae are consumed by the fish and
may not last long. I discuss algae in more detail in Chapter 14.
Plastic and silk seaweed replicas are available, and some marine hobbyists
like their plant-like appearance. Many of these fixtures are realistic and
attractive. They have the added advantage of not being something that can
die and cause water quality problems in the tank.
164
Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium 

Offering Ornaments
Aquarium dealers sell a variety of tank decorations that can enhance your aquar-
ium. Many come in the form of plastic, ceramic, or resin creations. By purchasing
these tank decorations from the dealer, you’re buying a product made for the
aquarium, thereby avoiding the potential of adding toxic substances to your
tank. Castles, mermaids, divers, and shipwrecks are common shapes that you or
your child may want to add to the aquarium. Air can be pumped to some of
these fixtures, producing interesting effects and providing aeration. My nephew
Clayton has a sunken battleship in his aquarium. Not for me, but I’m not 4.
Salt Water
There’s not a lot you can do at this point if you don’t have salt water. I don’t
know about you, but if I turn on my faucet I get fresh water. And I don’t need
to remind you that this is not a freshwater aquarium book. So you need to get
some salt water, but what exactly is it? Can you grab a bucket of water and
add table salt? No!
Natural seawater
The chemical composition of seawater is extremely consistent throughout
the world. Although it is 96 percent pure water (one atom of oxygen bonded
with two atoms of hydrogen: H2O), it also contains many dissolved minerals
and salts. These are mainly sodium and chlorine (85 percent of them), but
magnesium, sulphate, calcium, and potassium make up another 13 percent,
and bicarbonate and 68 other elements make up the remainder in trace quan-
tities (really small amounts).
You need to mimic natural seawater in the aquarium as closely as possible.
The best way to do this is to buy a synthetic salt mixture at your dealer.
The natural inclination for any beginner is to try to obtain natural seawater
from the local seashore. However, I strongly recommend that you don’t do
this unless you live very close to clean tropical seawater. I say this because:
 If you don’t live in the tropics and intend to maintain a tropical aquar-
ium, your local seawater will be colder. The colder water will contain
species of plankton (small critters) that are adapted to these tempera-
tures. Elevating the temperature to tropical levels will cause these organ-
isms to die or rapidly proliferate, yielding polluted or poor quality water.
165
Chapter 9: Fishy Furnishings and Finishing Touches

 The logistics of moving large quantities of seawater from the seashore is
impractical and will probably break your back. Oh, you may say, “I won’t
have to do it often.” Not true. Aquarium maintenance requires a steady
supply of salt water. It would probably be easier to run a pipe from the
beach.
 You have no guarantee that your water source is free of pollutants.
Seemingly clean seawater may contain high levels of toxic compounds
and metals. Even if you live in a pristine coastal area, the quality of the
water can change with the tide, and natural toxins can also be a prob-
lem. Why take any chances? 
You may be able to purchase filtered natural sea water from a public aquar-
ium in your area. It can’t hurt to ask.
Artificial seawater
The science of marine chemistry has produced sea salt mixes that mimic the
marine environment without the potential toxins. These mixes are dissolved
in ordinary tap water when you set up the aquarium. Although most of these
mixes are similar, you want to be sure that they are nitrate- and phosphate-
free. Not all are created equal, so it wouldn’t hurt to talk to your dealer. In
addition, some manufacturers claim that their mixes will help detoxify tap
water or add essential vitamins and minerals. This is always an added bonus.
Sea salt mixes are sold in a variety of sizes relative to the volume of salt water
that they can produce. Be aware that the actual volume of water in the tank
will be less than the tank volume because of gravel, aquarium equipment, and
ornamentation. So a 50-gallon mix will work for a 55-gallon aquarium because
the actual volume of the tank is less. However, it doesn’t hurt to have extra
salt around for water changes.
You can prepare your salt water in a couple of different ways, and each has
its own merits. Regardless of the mixing technique, you must follow the
instructions on the package. These mixes don’t all use the same freshwater-
to-salt ratio, so I can’t tell you how much to add per gallon — only the people
who make it can. Read the package carefully.
The simplest technique is to add the salt directly to the aquarium after you fill
it up. This works fine as long as you don’t put in too much salt. The best way to
avoid oversalting is to measure the amount of water that you’re adding as you
fill the tank. Add a little less salt than the manufacturer recommends for that
volume of water. So, if you put 27 gallons into your 30-gallon tank, add enough
salt for 25 gallons, let it sit overnight so that all the salt dissolves, measure the
salinity or specific gravity (see later in this chapter), and slowly add more salt
until the mix is right.
166
Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium 

The other method involves premixing your salt water in a separate container.
This method involves a little more work, but may be more accurate. It also
allows you to have some salt water on the shelf for water changes. To do this,
you get a large 5-gallon plastic bucket, preferably a food-safe bucket, and
slowly mix a batch of salt water just as you would in the aquarium. Take note
of the exact amount of water and salt mix used to get the chemistry just
right. Always allow the water to sit overnight so all the salt mix has time to
fully dissolve. When the salinity is right on, you can mix up salt water as
needed by using the bucket with the known amounts of water and salt mix.
Regardless of the method used, always mix up additional, properly balanced
salt water for water changes and emergencies. Also, for smaller quantities of
saltwater, many local dealers offer premixed saltwater, so you can save the
hassle of mixing your own. Store batches of seawater in non-metallic contain-
ers in cool, dark places until needed.
Conditioning tap water
To make salt water, you’re going to need fresh water. Most people use water
straight from the tap. This is the way to go. Forget the idea of filling your tank
with bottled water — it’s too costly and not feasible unless your tank is ten
gallons (and it shouldn’t be that small).
Now, I hate to tell you this, but the water out of your tap isn’t pure water. In
most places, the local water municipality chemically treats the water for
health reasons. The typical treatment includes chlorine or chloramine, which
can be toxic at levels much higher than found in natural seawater. In addition,
tap water can contain nitrates, sulphates, phosphates, and heavy metals,
which are also harmful to fish and invertebrates.
Call your local water company and ask them how they treat the water and
what the concentrations of these substances are, because most companies
routinely test their water.
To remove these chemicals, you have to condition your tap water. This can be
done in several ways. One of the easiest methods for removing chlorine and
chloramines is to let the water sit for 48 hours and let these chemicals perco-
late out. However, this won’t do much to remove high levels of heavy metals
or other compounds.
The more efficient way to condition your tap water is to purchase a chemical
water conditioner and dechlorinator. Your dealer will offer a variety of water
conditioners and, if he or she is local, will probably know the best one for the
water in your area. These conditioners can be added to your water to remove
chlorine, chloramine, and heavy metals.
167
Chapter 9: Fishy Furnishings and Finishing Touches

A number of water-purification units are available to the aquarist for the
removal of high levels of phosphates and nitrates from your tap water. These
reverse osmosis and deionization units attach to your faucet and remove a
number of substances like nitrates, phosphates, toxins, heavy metals, and
chlorine, depending on the unit that you buy. I’ll warn you that these units
can be expensive, but if your water supply is known to have high levels of
these toxins, you will probably need to buy one. Smaller home filter systems,
like refrigerator and pitcher filters, can also be used to remove low levels of
toxins from tap water, but may not be as efficient.
Adding reef supplements
While you’re in the chemical section of your aquarium dealer, you’ll probably
want to pick up a couple of other supplements if you plan on having a reef
tank. These are generally referred to as reef supplements and include impor-
tant elements like iodine and calcium. These are essential elements for your
invertebrates that can be added to your aquarium water.
Also buy a solution of calcium hydroxide, commonly referred to as kalk-
wasser, which is German for lime water. This product helps maintain calcium
levels in your reef tank. I discuss this in more detail in Chapter 13. Fish-only
tanks don’t require these kinds of supplements.
If you’re really in the mood to spend money, you can also buy a dosing pump
for dispensing reef supplements into the aquarium. This unit adds supple-
ments accurately and automatically, without human error. These can be as
simple as one that works with gravity like a hospital intravenous unit or one
that has a built-in pump, which is much more expensive.
Water Exams
As part of the proper care and maintenance of your aquarium, you have to
routinely test the water chemistry. Believe me, this sounds a lot worse than it
is. If your water passes the exams, your fish will be healthy. If not, you’re
going to have to make some corrections. If this a bit confusing, don’t worry,
because in Chapters 12 and 13 it all becomes much clearer. But because
you’re putting together the equipment for your aquarium, now is the time to
buy all the essentials, which includes test kits.
Hydrometer
Have you ever been swimming in the ocean, tasted salt water, and wondered
how much salt is in the sea? Well, science has developed a couple of ways to
measure the amount of dissolved salts in seawater. One measure is called
168
Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium 

salinity and another is called specific gravity. Although these measurements
aren’t the same, either can be used to determine the correct level of salt in
your aquarium. In Chapter 13, I discuss these terms in greater detail.
For now, you need to make sure you have just the right amount of salt in your
aquarium. To do this, you’re going to measure the specific gravity with a
hydrometer. There are basically two kinds of inexpensive hydrometers on the
market: floater and swinger.
Specific gravity should be established in the range of 1.021 to 1.024, but more
importantly, it should be maintained at a very specific level within this range.
Even minor fluctuations can cause problems for your tank inhabitants. More
on this in Chapter 13.
Floater
The most common hydrometer in my early aquarium days was the floating
hydrometer. This model looks like a large floating thermometer (see Figure
9-1) and may actually have one inside it. It consists of a long-necked tube
with a scale inside. The level at which the tube floats depends on how much
salt is in the water. You read the scale at the point where the water’s surface
meets the hydrometer and, bingo, the specific gravity. However, water move-
ment makes the floating hydrometer difficult to read accurately.

Weight

169
Chapter 9: Fishy Furnishings and Finishing Touches

Swinger
The swing-needle hydrometer is easier to read. This is basically a small plastic
box with a needle in it that pivots when the box is filled with aquarium water.
When the needle settles, it points to a scale that tells you the specific gravity.
Swinger hydrometers often need to be calibrated before they give an accu-
rate reading, so be sure to read the instructions. Also, the needle can some-
times stick, so tap the hydrometer to make sure it hasn’t. This hydrometer is
also known as a pointer hydrometer or floating-needle hydrometer.
Water chemistry test kits
You’re going to have to closely monitor the water chemistry of your aquar-
ium in order to maintain a healthy home for your pets. Sorry, there is no way
around it. The number of tests you conduct depends on whether you have a
reef tank or a fish-only tank (see Chapter 1). The latter isn’t as complicated,
and its inhabitants really don’t care about the levels of certain elements.
Throughout the rest of this section, I give you a simple shopping list of the
test kits I think you should buy, depending on the kind of aquarium you set
up. You may see some terms that don’t make a lot of sense to you, but don’t
worry about that. Chapters 12 and 13 go into great detail about water chem-
istry, and you’ll be brought right up to speed in no time.
The following test kits are the ones you need to set up and maintain your
aquarium:
 pH
 Ammonia
 Nitrite
 Nitrate
These four tests will tell you how well your biological filtration is working.
170
Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium 
Fancy equipment
You can purchase more expensive pieces of
equipment to measure salinity and specific grav-
ity. These are electronic monitors and refrac-
tometers that give very accurate measurements.
However, unless you plan on opening an aquar-
ium dealership, you really don’t need to make the
investment.

Other tests include alkalinity, calcium, copper, phosphate, dissolved oxygen,
iodine, and a number of others that have been introduced into the hobby
recently. Most of these are optional for the fish-only tank, but required for the
mini-reef tank. Because test kits are used to tell you the quantities of various
substances in your aquarium, how much testing you do depends on how
much you need to know. The more you test, the more you know — and the
more you can monitor the quality of your aquarium environment and make
corrections.
Newer aquarists have a tendency to test the water more frequently than sea-
soned veterans, and there’s nothing wrong with that.
Use Table 9-1 as a general guide for purchasing test kits. As your tank
becomes more complicated, you can always add to your test kit collection.

Test kits are made so that you don’t have to be a chemist to use them.
Although a couple of methods have been developed, the most common
involves adding drops of a test chemical to an aquarium sample that changes
the color of the water. You then match the water color with that on a color
chart, which tells you the correct level of what you’re testing.
Be sure to follow the instructions that come with the test kit so that you get
accurate results.
171
Chapter 9: Fishy Furnishings and Finishing Touches

Test probes
As our world becomes more and more electronically oriented, aquarium-
testing monitors will become more widespread and less expensive. In addition
to the salinity and specific gravity meters, there are also pH and dissolved
oxygen probes available. These provide fast, reliable, and accurate measure-
ments without test chemicals, but they’re much more expensive than the
average test kit.
Quarantine Tank
The quarantine tank is really just another small aquarium that you use to iso-
late a fish or an invertebrate. That’s why it’s also called an isolation tank, but I
think that sounds too lonely.
A quarantine tank is a piece of equipment that you may eventually use to iso-
late new fish and new invertebrates to make sure that they’re healthy before
putting them into your well-established aquarium (see Chapter 5). More
importantly, a quarantine tank is used to isolate diseased fish for treatment
(see Chapter 18). This is particularly true for reef tanks because you can’t
treat fish with invertebrates.
A quarantine tank is a straightforward setup that includes a small tank with
simple filtration, a heater, and minimal ornamentation. So a ten-gallon tank
with a sponge or box filter, a clamp-on heater, and a couple of plastic plants
will do the trick.
Frankly, the quarantine tank is a nice idea, but if your budget is limited, you can
delay the purchase of this setup until your main aquarium is fully established.
Nets
All aquaria should be well equipped to handle fish and other tank occupants.
This means that you definitely need a fishnet or two — see Figure 9-2. You
will likely use a net more than you think. It will come in very handy when you
need to remove a fish that is ill or dead, one that’s too aggressive, or one that
you simply want to get rid of.
172
Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium 

Size
Nets for the aquarium come in variety of sizes, from a couple of inches across
to 10 inches wide. Too small a net will be difficult to use to corner a fish, and
too large a net will be difficult to maneuver in the tank. Match the size of the
net with the size of the fish and the size of the tank. Trying to catch a 6-inch
fish in a 55-gallon tank with a 4-inch net is pretty entertaining to watch.
Meshing around
The netting itself is called the mesh, and it can be either fine or coarse. Fine
mesh tends to be softer and less abrasive to the fish, but it moves slower in
the water. On the other hand, coarse mesh may scrape the fish, but you’ll

173
Chapter 9: Fishy Furnishings and Finishing Touches

probably catch it faster. You have to strike the right balance. The more you
chase your fish around the tank, the more stressed it becomes, and the more
you disrupt the aquarium and its other inhabitants. So, I tend to buy a larger
net with mesh that allows me to move the net quickly and effectively through
the water to bag the fish.
Consider keeping a couple of sizes handy. For example, a fish that’s ill is prob-
ably not moving much and needs to be handled with care, so a fine-meshed
soft net is best for this critter. But that irascible wrasse that has been terror-
izing the tank needs to be removed quickly, and a coarse-meshed fast net will
do it with minimal disturbance. Let’s face it, a healthy fish doesn’t want to be
caught. Just ask my brother Paul, the fisherman.
Cleaning Tools
As you develop your talents as an aquarist, you’re going to accumulate many
accessories for your tank that make your job easier and help you to maintain
a well-balanced aquarium. This section shares a few items that will give you a
head start.
When I talk about cleaning your aquarium, it doesn’t in any way, shape, or
form mean that you use any kind of soap. Household detergents leave
residues that are toxic to your pets. Glass cleaners are fine for the outside of
the tank, but make sure that you apply them to a cloth without spraying the
tank. Spray goes everywhere, including inside the tank, which means bye-
bye, fishy.
You can purchase special nontoxic chemical cleaners for your aquarium.
These include disinfectants, fungicides, and sanitizers that leave no residues.
A good bucket
You may laugh at this, but I think one of the most important pieces of stan-
dard aquarium equipment is the common bucket. I really don’t need to fully
explain why because you’re going to find out soon enough.
Right from the get-go, you should have at least one (or many) bucket(s) com-
mitted to your aquarium, and only to your aquarium. Going into the cabinet
under the sink or into the broom closet for a bucket isn’t a good idea because
you know what those buckets are used for: cleaning the house. And what did
I just say about soaps and detergents?
174
Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium 

You use a bucket to fill your tank, hold tank inhabitants, empty your tank,
hold aquarium fixtures and decorations, transport new water, transport old
water, hold aquarium equipment, sit on, store conditioned water, and on and
on. Go for a bucket that is considered food safe and holds at least 5 gallons.
Write in big letters on the side: FOR AQUARIUM USE ONLY or MY AQUARIUM
or whatever, but mark it in some way to keep your brother Bernie from
changing his car’s oil with it.
Substrate sucking
Part of your maintenance routine includes cleaning the gravel. This doesn’t
mean scooping it out of the tank and washing it — no way. In the old days, we
used to use just a short piece of hose to suck the debris off the surface of the
gravel. Now, the much simpler way involves the use of a gravel vacuum
(shown in Figure 9-3), which lets you get into the gravel to clean it.

Figure 9-3:
A typical

vacuum is

175
Chapter 9: Fishy Furnishings and Finishing Touches

Gravel vacuums remove the debris that accumulates in the gravel, clogs your
undergravel filter, and causes water-chemistry problems. Most gravel clean-
ing is done during water changes, which is a great time. So gravel vacuums
are designed to remove water and debris at the same time. A number of
models are available, from pump-, siphon-, or battery-powered to those that
connect directly to the faucet for bucket-free cleaning.
Be aware that topping off evaporated water is different from changing the
water. It’s okay to add fresh water when topping the tank off, but you don’t
want to add fresh water to an established aquarium during partial water
changes; this will mess up your salinity. Instead, add pre-mixed salt water of
the same salinity. So, gravel vacuums that remove water, clean the gravel, and
refill the aquarium are fine as long as they don’t add water directly from the
faucet.
In addition to your gravel vacuum, keep a short piece of hose available. It will
come in handy for the occasional siphon job.
Away with algae
Algae comprise an issue I discuss in detail in Chapter 14, but suffice to say it
will grow in your aquarium and on your aquarium. If it gets out of hand, you
won’t be able to see your fish. Hence, the algae scrubber.
A variety of styles are available, but the concept is pretty straightforward:
Rub the algae off the glass. Aquarium pads, scrapers, scrubbers, and mitts
are all available to do the job. I tend to favor the scrubbing pad on a stick
with a head that angles so you can apply pressure to stubborn areas. The
pads are usually made for acrylic or glass tanks because you don’t want one
that will scratch.
Some folks prefer to place their hands in the tank and use scrubbing pads or
mitts. This is fine as long as you don’t disturb your tank inhabitants too
much. Every time you go into the tank, your pets are going to be disturbed,
and any way you can minimize that, the better. A big hand with a scrubbing
mitt in a small aquarium may drive the fish into hiding for days.
If you want to be completely hands off, use one of those magnet setups that
has a scrubbing pad on a magnet inside the tank held by a magnet outside
the tank. Moving the magnet on the outside moves the magnet on the inside
and cleans the glass. However, these don’t clean stubborn and tight areas
very well.

Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium 

Odds and ends
Tongs and grabbers let you work in your aquarium without having to place
your whole hand and arm in the tank. This minimizes disturbances to your
fish and invertebrates. Suppose you want to adjust the placement of a fixture
or your nephew Clayton dropped your car keys in the tank. Grab the tongs
and take care of it without having to go swimming.
Another handy item is a tube brush. This is used to keep aquarium intake
and output tubing clear and free of algae. The brush is round in diameter and
flexible so it inserts into the tube. Standard scrubbers and brushes simply
don’t do the job. You do, however, have to size the brush to the tube, but
that’s no big deal.

Aquarium
In This Chapter

 Checking out brackish water fishes
 Planting your brackish water aquarium
M
any folks think that there are only two options when it comes to aquar-
iums — saltwater or freshwater — but this is not the case. There is
also the brackish water aquarium, which is really just a freshwater aquarium
with salt or, if you prefer, a saltwater aquarium with less salt. It’s somewhere
in between the two — a gray area, if you will.
The brackish water aquarium is a unique environment that tends to be more
like a freshwater aquarium than a saltwater aquarium. The critters that thrive
in a brackish water aquarium are equally unique, as are the special kinds of
live plants that thrive in this ecosystem. If you like the saltwater aquarium
look, yet want the hardiness and feel of the freshwater world, then the brack-
ish water aquarium may be the right choice for you. The purpose of this
chapter is to introduce you to the brackish water aquarium and its unique
characteristics. Perhaps the color gray is right for you.
The Brackish Water Environment
Ponds and rivers are typically what come to mind when you think of freshwa-
ter environments and the fishes that live in them. On the other hand, typical
saltwater habitats include the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans and unique
ecosystems like coral reefs. Well, since all freshwater rivers ultimately flow
into the saltwater ocean, there are places where these two worlds collide.

180
Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium 
Freshwater mixes with salt water to form brackish water, and these areas
create special habitats for all kinds of animals. Typical brackish water envi-
ronments include river mouths, such as where the Mississippi meets the Gulf
of Mexico, and bays, like where the Potomac River meets Chesapeake Bay.
An area where salt and fresh water collide is typically called an estuary.
Delaware Bay is a good example of a large estuary. These areas are among the
most productive in the world. There are species of fish that spend their
entire lives in estuarine areas, and a remarkable number of fishes spend at
least some part of their lives in an estuary.
Brackish water environments tend to be dynamic areas that are not only
influenced by freshwater flow, but also by rising and falling tides. Hence, the
mix of salt and fresh water is always changing. The fishes and invertebrates
that live in brackish water are well adapted to rapid changes in salinity and
tend to be hardier than fish that live exclusively in salt water.
Equipment You Need (or Don’t Need)
The ever-changing environment of the estuary need not be re-created in your
aquarium if you choose to set up a brackish water environment. However,
you do want to mimic the basic conditions of an estuary and may even want
to keep brackish water plants.
In Chapters 6 through 9, I discuss the equipment that you need to set up a
healthy marine aquarium. Because the brackish water aquarium is more simi-
lar to a freshwater aquarium, your equipment is going to more closely mimic
that of a freshwater setup.
Tank
Although I recommend that the minimum size of a saltwater aquarium is 30
gallons (see Chapter 6), this is not the case for the brackish water aquarium,
which can be as small as 10 gallons. However, many of the brackish water
fishes are highly active, schooling critters that need a lot of space — keep
this in mind when choosing a tank. Other than this, the brackish water aquar-
ium differs little from the saltwater setup in terms of tank type (either glass
or acrylic), tank stand, and canopy.

Filter
Although biological filtration is important for any kind of aquarium setup,
advanced filtration, such as a trickle filter, is not needed for the brackish
water aquarium. Live rock will not survive in the fresh-ish water of the aquar-
ium, and the undergravel filter won’t work with the sandy substrate. Instead,
the best filter systems for the brackish water aquarium include power filters
that hang on the side of the tank and canister filters. Both these filter types
provide adequate mechanical, chemical, and biological filtration. I suggest
you read Chapter 7 for specific information on these filters.
Although a protein skimmer is essential for the average saltwater aquarium
(see Chapter 7), it is not required for the brackish water setup. However, it
certainly does not hurt.
Light and heat
Lighting and heating is standard for the brackish water aquarium (see
Chapter 8). However, the shorelines of many brackish water areas are shaded
by plant life like mangrove trees. Therefore, many brackish water aquarists
prefer to have low to medium lighting or a shaded area of the aquarium. This
should not be the case if you plan to keep brackish water plants, because
they need adequate lighting for optimal growth. In this case, the plants will
provide shaded areas for your fishes.
Other ingredients
In Chapter 9, I highlight many of the odds and ends typical of the average
saltwater aquarium. Most of these items, such as a hydrometer to measure
salt levels, water test kits, nets, and cleaning tools, are equally as handy for
the brackish water aquarium. However, there are few exceptions. For exam-
ple, coral furnishings and live rock are typically not found in the brackish
water environment and should be left off your list of tank decorations.
Substrate
Although I thoroughly recommend calcium-based gravels for the saltwater
aquarium, sand is the most natural substrate for the brackish aquarium. This
is because most brackish environments have bottoms composed of mud and
sand, which is ideal for plants. If you plan on keeping plants, I recommend a
sand layer of about one inch with soil mixed into the lower layer. Otherwise,
keep your substrate layer very thin so as to avoid the development of anoxic
zones, that is, areas without oxygen.
181
Chapter 10: Partial to Salt: The Brackish Aquarium

Salt
As I noted earlier, the brackish water habitat is largely fresh water mixed with
some salt water. So, you will need to have some salt on hand to make your
aquarium a wee bit salty. Although I’ve seen some folks use table salt to do
this, I strongly recommend the use of an artificial seawater salt mixture that
is available at all saltwater aquarium dealers (see Chapter 9).
If you are setting up a saltwater aquarium, you follow the directions on the
package and the steps in Chapter 11 to properly balance the correct salt level
(specific gravity) in your aquarium. However, the brackish water aquarium
does not contain full-strength seawater. So, (I don’t write this too often) don’t
follow the directions on the package when you add salt to your brackish
water aquarium.
In Chapter 13, I discuss salt balance in the aquarium in great detail. For our
purposes here, suffice to say that the level of salt in your aquarium is called
its specific gravity, which is the ratio of densities of seawater to pure water at
various temperatures. You use a hydrometer to measure specific gravity in
your aquarium (see Chapter 9). 
In the standard saltwater aquarium, specific gravity should be established in
the range of 1.021 to 1.024. However, the level of salt in the brackish water
aquarium should be much lower and largely depends on the salt preferences
of your brackish water fish. In general, most of the brackish water fishes high-
lighted later in this chapter prefer brackish water with a specific gravity of
1.005-1.010.
When setting up your brackish water aquarium, follow the steps in Chapter
11, but reduce the amount of salt that you add to the tank to establish the
correct salt level. A good estimate to begin with is 1 to 2 tablespoons of
marine salt per gallon. Allow the salt to fully dissolve over 24 hours, and then
fine-tune the specific gravity as needed.
Fishes for the Brackish Water Aquarium
As I noted earlier, those critters that inhabit the brackish water environment
tend to be hardier and easier to keep because they are well adapted to an
ever-changing, dynamic world. For this reason, you don’t have to be an
aquarium expert or a seasoned veteran to house many of the common brack-
ish water fishes. In addition, many of the fishes from brackish water readily
live happily in full marine or full freshwater aquariums, should you decide to
go in either of these directions.
182
Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium 

In the following sections, I’ve listed the most common of the brackish water
fishes available to those with a brackish water interest. This is by no means
the most comprehensive list of all the species available, but includes those
you are most likely to encounter at your local dealer.
Monos (Monodactylidae)
Sometimes called mooneyfishes or fingerfishes, the monos look very similar to
and are often confused with common freshwater angelfishes. In the wild,
these fish form large schools at the mouths of rivers, so you should consider
keeping more than one in your aquarium.
Mono or Malayan angel (Monodactylus argenteus)
Although there are two species of monos found in the aquarium trade, this
species is by far the most common. This mono has a silver body with black
and yellow fins. Juveniles are found in fresh and brackish water, but they
move into saltwater as they get older. For this reason, large monos (longer
than 3 inches) need an aquarium with more salt in the water and are best
kept in a marine aquarium. Monos will readily accept all kinds of aquarium
foods including fresh seafood and flakes. A similar species is the Sebae mono
(Monodactylus sebae).
 Distribution: Africa, Indonesia
 Size: 10 inches
 Food: Omnivorous
 Tank level: Middle level
Scats (Scatophagidae)
Members of the scat family only comprise four species from the Indo-Pacific.
In the wild, these fishes inhabit harbors, bays, estuaries, the lower reaches of
freshwater streams, and mangroves.
Scat (Scatophagus argus)
Like monos, scats are good fishes for the community brackish water aquar-
ium. They are available in a large number of varieties with differing colors
and patterns, ranging from brown to green and from spots to vertical stripes.
Scats are best kept in schools of several fish. They are hardy fish that will
183
Chapter 10: Partial to Salt: The Brackish Aquarium

readily accept a diverse array of aquarium foods and particularly like plant
material. This latter attribute makes them poor additions to heavily planted
brackish water aquariums.
 Distribution: Indonesia
 Size: 12 inches
 Food: Omnivorous
 Tank level: Middle level
Archerfishes (Toxotidae)
The archerfishes are so named because they spit a stream of water to knock
down insects, which are their preferred food. Archers can be trained to spit
in captivity by leaving a large space of 4 to 6 inches above the waterline and
placing food items on the glass in this space.
Common or banded archerfish (Toxotes jaculatrix)
The common archerfish is a deep-bodied fish with vertical black bands that
needs a larger tank because of its large size. This fish is best kept singly
because it can be aggressive to its own kind. Although archerfish prefer live
foods like insects, they will accept fresh seafood, such as shrimp.
 Distribution: Southeast Asia, Australia
 Size: 10 inches
 Food: Carnivorous
 Tank level: Top and middle levels
Mollies (Poeciliidae)
Anyone who has kept a freshwater aquarium is well aware of mollies because
they are the most common live-bearing fish sold in the aquarium trade.
However, few folks know that mollies are also ideal brackish water fishes.
There are over 290 species in this family, which also includes the common
guppy and the swordtail.
Sailfin mollie (Poecilia latipinna)
The sailfin molly is available in many varieties and color patterns, but the
most common are silver green. Mollies spawn readily in captivity, and the
conscientious aquarist can raise high-quality fry by paying attention to water
quality. Mollies eat a variety of aquarium foods, but care should be taken to
include vegetable matter.
184
Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium 

 Distribution: North America
 Size: 5 inches
 Food: Omnivorous
 Tank level: Top and middle levels
Puffers (Tetraodontidae)
In Chapter 3, I discuss some of the pufferfishes available to the marine aquar-
ist, but this diverse family also contains members that live in fresh and brack-
ish water habitats.
Green spotted puffer (Tetraodon nigroviridis)
Like most puffers, the green spotted puffer should be kept singly because it is
aggressive to other puffers. In the wild and in captivity, pufferfish prefer to
eat shellfish, such as snails, which they crush with their heavy teeth. This
species has been known to adapt to processed food pellets as well.
 Distribution: Sri Lanka to Indonesia
 Size: 4 inches
 Food: Carnivorous
 Tank level: Middle level
Plants That Are Partial to Salt
In the typical marine aquarium, algae will be your only plant-like inhabitant.
However, brackish water habitats throughout the world almost always con-
tain a broad array of true plants ranging from small marine grasses to large
mangroves trees. Adding plants to your brackish water aquarium is a great
idea because they help to stabilize water quality, produce oxygen, provide
food and habitat, and add aesthetically pleasing natural fixtures to your tank.
Providing for grazers
Many brackish water fish species consume plant material and will actively
graze on your plants. While providing natural food for your pets is great, too
much grazing will prune your plants to the roots, thereby wrecking your
garden, so to speak, and disrupting water quality. Therefore, it is best for the
beginner to avoid softer and tastier plant varieties that tend to be more palat-
able to your fishes.
185
Chapter 10: Partial to Salt: The Brackish Aquarium

In my opinion, the following plants are attractive, easy to keep, and stand up
well to grazers.
 Java Fern (Microsorium pteropus): This is a popular and commonly
sold plant ideally suited to the brackish water aquarium. The plant does
not need to be buried in the gravel and it will attach to rocks and other
fixtures. Java fern thrives in low lighting and will not be disturbed by
burrowing and plant-eating fishes. In addition, the Java fern with its
broad green leaves will readily propagate in your aquarium.
 Water sprite (Ceratopteris spp.): Considered by some to be the best
aquarium plants, water sprites are beautiful, thick- or thin-leaved plants
that float or root in your aquarium. Though water sprites derive their
nutrients with their leaves, some soil in their substrate is beneficial.
Medium lighting is sufficient for these plants, which will readily cast
shadows throughout your tank.
 Hygrophila spp.: Often called hygros, these plants, which vary consider-
ably in leaf shape and color, thrive under a variety of aquarium condi-
tions. Hence, they are ideal for the beginner. Moreover, they are
generally not considered palatable by many brackish water fishes.
 Tape Grass (Vallisneria spp.): For those looking for tall, grass-like plants,
the tape grasses are nice additions to the brackish water aquarium.
 Pygmy Chain Sword (Echinodorus tenellus): As the name implies, this
is a smaller plant that is perfectly suited to the foreground part of the
aquarium. This plant needs a rich substrate and medium to high levels
of lighting. It propagates rapidly by running roots under the gravel.
Planting and tending your garden
As is the case with the purchase of all your aquarium pets, be they animal or
plant, always shop at a reputable dealer and choose healthy-looking plants
from clean aquariums. Also, be just as careful when adding new plants to
your brackish water ecosystem. Just because they seem hardier than fish,
they are not necessarily. (Although, you really don’t need to talk to them.)
Make sure that the water chemistry is similar between the tank from which
the plants are coming and the tank to which the plants are going. That is,
check specific gravity, pH, water hardness, and temperature. Radical differ-
ences between the two tanks will shock and kill your new plants.
Once your plants are established in your aquarium, your work is not over. Like
algae, some plants can overrun a tank, so they need to be pruned. Also, remove
any and all dead and dying plant leaves, roots, or stems so that water quality is
not impacted by rotting plant material. Finally, just as you routinely fertilize
your vegetable garden, you may need to enrich the substrate of your aquarium.
Please don’t dump a bag of fertilizer in the tank! Instead, routinely (about once
a month) mix soil with clay into the lower levels of your substrate.

Getting Your Aquarium 
Up and Running
In This Chapter
 Setting up your aquarium 
 Getting it all together
 Understanding why you don’t want to skip any steps
P
erhaps, if I were a fly on the wall, I would see you scratching your head
standing next to an empty aquarium (on a stand with a hood or glass
canopy) with some lighting fixtures, a heater or two, one or two filters, filter
media, a protein skimmer, a thermometer, a hydrometer, a bucket full of
rinsed gravel, some aquarium decorations and fixtures, an aerating pump, air-
stones, fishnets, water conditioners, a bag of artificial salts, a spare bucket or
two, an aquarium background, test kits, and some algae scrubbers.
If that doesn’t sound like the components you’ve put together, go over the
other chapters in this part and then come back.
Now you have to put them all together. In this chapter, I walk you step-by-step
through the process of setting up your new saltwater aquarium. The aquarium
components may differ from system to system, but the same general steps
apply. For best results, follow this chapter in the order presented here.
Stand and Aquarium Placement
Place the aquarium stand in the appropriate location, taking into account
floor stability, access to water and electricity, aesthetic value, visibility, and
adequate distance from doors and windows. Make sure the stand is level,
stable, and doesn’t rock. Leave enough room for air-line tubing, electrical
cords, and equipment that hangs on the back of the tank (filter, protein skim-
mer, and heater).

Aquarium rinse
Before you place the aquarium where it will sit for a very long time (I hope),
move it to a place where you can give it a quick rinse. In the summer, you can
do this outside with a garden hose, but in the winter you may not want to go
outside, especially if you live where water freezes. In this case, rinse the tank
in a bathroom tub or in the kitchen. This doesn’t require thorough washing,
just a simple rinse with fresh water and a clean sponge to remove dust and
dirt. If the aquarium is too large to move about, simply wipe out the tank with
a clean sponge dampened with fresh water.
Remember, though, no soap or detergent. Just rinse with water.
Aquarium placement
Place the aquarium on the stand so that it sits properly. That means there is
no overhang, and the tank sits perfectly flat on the stand. Double-check to
make sure you left enough room behind the aquarium for equipment.
Background
This is a good time to put your background on the back of the tank.
Otherwise, it may be tough to do so after the filters and tubing are in place.
Most backgrounds are affixed with regular tape.
Filters
With the exception of the live rock, now is the time to set up your filter
system. But I mean only set it up, not turn it on, so don’t plug it in or fill it with
water.
In Chapter 7, I discuss filters in great detail. In this section, I walk through
how to set up the most common varieties. Please don’t only take my word for
it; read the instructions that come with the filter from beginning to end.
188
Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium 

Undergravel
Place the undergravel filter into the aquarium and make sure it sits flat inside
the tank. Make sure the lift tubes are at the back of the tank and put the pow-
erheads in place, clipping them to the back of the aquarium. If your under-
gravel filter is powered by air, attach the airstones to the rigid tubing, place
them in the lift tubes, and put the exhaust caps on the tubes. Attach the air-
lines to the tubes and run them to an air pump. Angle the powerheads or the
exhaust ports toward the front center of the tank.
External power filter
Rinse the filter media and put it in the filter as recommended by the manufac-
turer. Hang the external power filter on the back of the tank, but don’t fill it
with water yet. Trim the filter so it hangs straight up and down on the back of
the tank.
Canister filter
Follow the manufacturer’s instructions and fill the canister with filter media
that has been rinsed. Snap the top into place, paying particular attention to
the O-ring, making sure that it’s seated correctly. Check with the written
directions to see whether the canister should be filled with water before clos-
ing it up. Place the canister in the desired position and run the intake and
output lines to the aquarium, attaching them with suction cups, if supplied.
Trickle filter
Place the trickle filter into the appropriate position under the tank. Follow
the instructions provided by the manufacturer to install the overflow system
on the back of the tank, add the filter media, and set up the lines to and from
the aquarium.
189
Chapter 11: Getting Your Aquarium Up and Running

Fluidized bed filter
Most fluidized bed filters hang on the back of the tank and receive water from
a powerhead or a separate pump. Follow the instructions supplied by the
manufacturer to set up the plumbing to and from this unit.
Protein skimmer
With so many designs available on today’s market, I can’t tell you how to set
up your particular brand. My best advice is to follow the instructions closely
and seek assistance from your local dealer.
Live rock
At this point, don’t even think about adding live rock or you might as well
change the name of it to dead rock. If live rock is a main source of filtration
for you, don’t worry about setting it up until a few steps down the list. Trust
me, I’ll tell you when.
Substrate
After rinsing your gravel or sand (see Chapter 9), add it to the tank. Feel free
to provide a little depth to the aquarium by sloping it downward gently
toward the front of the tank. Follow my guidelines in Chapter 9 regarding the
maximum depth of your gravel.
Don’t place live sand in the tank at this time because it too requires water to
stay alive, and you haven’t gotten that far yet.
Ornamentation
Add the rocks, coral, and other decorations in the pattern you’ve planned.
Now’s the time to pull out that piece of paper with your design on it and see
how it looks. Start by placing really large and heavy rocks down through the
gravel and close to the bottom of the tank for stability. This is a good time to
add plastic plants as well, even though you may want to adjust them later.
190
Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium 

Don’t put live rocks or live coral in at this time, because they really need
water!
Aeration
Place airstones or run air-lines to aerating ornaments in the aquarium. They
should be placed near the substrate. Use suction cups, if provided, to secure
the airstones. Run air lines to the air valves or directly to the air pump.
Heater
Clip the hanging heater on the back of your aquarium or place the sub-
mersible heater in the tank. Put the submersible heater near the bottom of
the aquarium at the back and use suction cups if you have them. Make sure
you position it so you can see the indicator light. See Chapter 8 for more on
heaters.
Don’t plug the heater in.
Water
Place a large saucer or bowl on the gravel in your aquarium. This will buffer
the force of water and keep it from upsetting your gravel and decorations.
Using a bucket, fill your aquarium by pouring tap water or premixed salt
water into the bowl or saucer so that the overfill spills gently over the sides
uniformly.
Use your thermometer to make sure that the temperature of the water you’re
adding is between 75°F and 78°F. After the tank is filled to within an inch of
the top, remove the saucer or bowl.
At this point, make sure that your tank has no leaks. Dry the entire outside of
the tank with paper towels and closely inspect the seams for drops of water.
If you see a leak, empty the tank and return it to the dealer.
191
Chapter 11: Getting Your Aquarium Up and Running

Water Conditioner and Salt
If you haven’t premixed your salt water (see Chapter 9), add your water con-
ditioner, following the instructions on the bottle. Then add your artificial salt
mix, following the instructions of the manufacturer.
Test the water with your hydrometer to check the specific gravity, which
should be in the range of 1.021 to 1.024.
Hood 
Now that all the equipment is in place, but not started, place the hood or
glass canopy on the tank to fit it properly.
You may have to adjust not only the hood, but also other aquarium equip-
ment such as the heater or protein skimmer, to make the hood sits correctly.
Now is the time to move equipment, before it’s up and running. Some hoods
need to be fitted by adjusting and trimming, so follow the instructions that
came with your hood to make sure you do it right. You may need to remove
the hood to complete the aquarium setup, but now you know that compo-
nents are where they should be and replacing the hood is easy.
Thermometer and Heater
Place your thermometer in or on the aquarium, depending on the model that
you purchased. Check your temperature and make sure the temperature is
between 75°F and 79°F. Plug your heater in and adjust it accordingly to set
the temperature in this range. If you need to calibrate your heater, flip to
Chapter 8 and review how.
Filters, Again
After your aquarium is full of water, fire up your filter systems to get the ball
rolling. How you do this depends heavily on the type of filter you have —
they’re discussed in the following sections.
192
Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium 

Undergravel filter
This is pretty simple. Start the powerheads or plug in the air pump if you
have an air-driven system. You should see bubbles pouring out of the exhaust
ports.
External power filter
Fill the filter box with water from the tank and plug it in. Make sure that water
is flowing out of the filter. It will expel bubbles at first, but this will end
shortly, and the filter should run smoothly.
Canister filter
Follow the manufacturer’s instructions to start the canister filter. Some need
to be primed with water before being plugged in.
This filter will also spit bubbles until the air is driven out of the system. You
may need to fill the intake hose with water to get it going. If you have an
undergravel filter with a powerhead, use it to fill the intake line. Otherwise,
you can draw water into the output line from the tank end.
Trickle filter
My best recommendation for firing up the trickle filter is to closely follow the
instructions of the manufacturer. That’s because with so many models out
there, what works for one doesn’t apply to another. These filters provide
excellent filtration, but they can be a bit complicated to get going properly.
Don’t be afraid to go to the source and talk to the dealer who sold it to you.
Fluidized bed filter
This simply involves plugging in the pump or powerhead that drives the
water into the filter. Make sure all connections are tight.
193
Chapter 11: Getting Your Aquarium Up and Running

Protein skimmer
Follow the instructions that came with your protein skimmer to get it going.
You will need to adjust the flow of air to make sure that the unit is working
properly.
Live rock
You are almost there, but not quite yet. Keep the live rock out of the aquar-
ium until the temperature and salinity have stabilized. Give me a couple of
more steps, we’ll get there. This stuff is alive, so we have to keep it that way.
Your best bet is not to pick up your live rock from the dealer until your aquar-
ium is ready.
Aeration, Again
Start your air pump and check your air-lines and connections for air leaks.
Make sure the airstones are positioned properly. If you have a wavemaker, get
it going.
Lighting
After your filters are running, and the hood or glass canopy is in place, you
can set up the lighting fixtures. Strip lights are placed on top of the tank,
while hanging lamps and pendants need to be suspended from the ceiling
attached to a ceiling hook. After all the lighting is in place, plug everything in
and turn your lights on.
24-Hour Adjustments
Your filters are running, the heater is working, and the lights are on. What do
you see? Foggy water. Don’t worry, this will clear up pretty rapidly, usually
overnight. Over the next 24 hours, carefully monitor water temperature and
salinity (specific gravity) and adjust your heater and add salt as needed. If
your specific gravity is too high, you may need to take water out and add
fresh water.
194
Part II: Setting Up Your Aquarium 

Live Sand and Rocks
If your first 24 hours went smoothly, the aquarium is now well balanced with
salt and heat, your filters are running smoothly, and the water has cleared.
Now you can add some live sand to introduce bacteria into the tank and start
to build the biological filtration. You can add live rock now, as well. This, too,
will start the tank-maturation process and get your aquarium into the nitro-
gen cycle, which I talk about in Chapter 12.
Make sure you don’t add too much live rock at this point, particularly if it’s
not properly cured. Also, be sure to remove some water before adding the
rock so the tank doesn’t overflow.
Maturity
Your aquarium needs to mature before you add fish and invertebrates. What
do I mean by mature? Well, in Chapter 12, I discuss this thoroughly, but it
means that a healthy bacterial colony needs to be established, and the tank
needs to be cycled. So don’t run out and buy fish and invertebrates until you
read Chapter 12.
At this point, though, you can run some water chemistry tests for pH and
ammonia. Start a chemistry log and write down the results you get, because
they’re going to change, and you want to follow these changes.
Adding Fish
When your aquarium has matured, you can add fish slowly. Which fish you
add is a big decision, and I discuss that in Part I of this book.

his chapter gets into the nuts and bolts of water chemistry. You’re proba-
bly thinking, “Chemistry . . . ugh!” Don’t worry, I stick to the basics and
limit my discussion to what you really need to know to maintain a healthy
saltwater aquarium. Though some of the concepts may seem complex at first,
they really aren’t too bad.
When I established my first aquarium more than 30 years ago, I was excited
and antsy to have a fully stocked, beautiful aquarium. And my family knew it.
So, just a week after setting it up, my brothers, sisters, and parents loaded me
up with some nice tropical fishes, including angels, butterflies, triggers, and
even a lionfish. Well, you guessed it, within days, my fish started dying and,
by the end of a week, I had literally flushed hundreds of dollars down the
drain. Why? Overstocking too fast without a well-established nitrogen cycle!
That was a tough lesson to learn, but this chapter helps you avoid a similar
experience.
Nitrogen In and Out
In Chapter 7, I discuss filtration and the basic concepts of keeping your
aquarium water clean. In that chapter, you discover that fish and inverte-
brates are living creatures that require food for energy, burning it with the
help of oxygen that they respire (breathe) from the water. However, these
processes produce waste products that are returned to the environment
through the gills and in the urine and feces. These wastes are primarily
carbon dioxide and nitrogenous compounds (like ammonia), which are
extremely toxic to fish.

200
Part III: Taking Proper Care of Your Aquarium 
In the aquarium, these wastes must be removed. Carbon dioxide generally
leaves the water through aeration at the surface or through photosynthesis
by aquarium algae. Ammonia, on the other hand, must be converted to
nitrite, which is then converted to nitrate, a less toxic compound. This is the
nitrogen cycle.
Your marine animals aren’t the only source of nitrogenous wastes. Every time
you feed your pets, excess food will decompose into harmful compounds,
including ammonia. That is why you need to make every effort to feed your
fish carefully so as not to leave excess food in the aquarium.
Understanding the Cycle
This conversion of harmful ammonia into nitrite and then nitrate is called the
nitrogen cycle (see Figure 12-1). Why do you need to know about the nitrogen
cycle? Because it is the basis of biological filtration, and your filters use bio-
logical filtration to keep your aquarium clean.
Before you can fully stock an aquarium, you need to establish the nitrogen
cycle.

The role of bacteria
Biological filtration is actually bacteriological filtration. Believe it or not, the
nitrogen cycle is driven by bacteria. Bacteria that convert ammonia (NH4)
into nitrite (NO2) belong to the genus Nitrosomonas. Nitrite, in turn, is con-
verted into nitrate (NO3) by bacteria of the genus Nitrobacter. These
processes together are called nitrification.
A healthy aquarium depends greatly on the nitrogen cycle to reduce toxic
ammonia into less-toxic nitrogen compounds. In your aquarium, ammonia
builds slowly but decreases as it is converted to nitrite. Then as the nitrite is
converted to nitrate, nitrite decreases, and nitrate slowly accumulates.
Ultimately, your healthy aquarium will have consistently low levels of ammo-
nia and nitrite, while nitrate slowly builds.
You may be wondering what happens to the nitrate. Well, nitrate may be
assimilated by algae, or it may be converted to nitrogen gas by denitrifying
bacteria. In most aquarium systems, however, nitrate slowly accumulates in
the water because the amounts of algae and bacteria that would be neces-
sary to assimilate all the nitrate or convert it all to nitrogen gas are lacking.
Although nitrate is relatively harmless to fish, it must eventually be removed
or diluted before toxic levels are reached. You do this with frequent water
changes (removing a portion of the aquarium water and replacing it with
fresh batches of premixed salt water — see Chapter 15).
Testing the cycle
The nitrogen cycle needs to be established in a biological filter, which is a
requirement for all marine aquariums. Even with a properly functioning bio-
logical filter, however, you want to monitor frequently the levels of ammonia,
nitrite, and nitrate. You do this with commercial test kits that are available at
your fish dealer.
With the test kits that I outline in Chapter 9, you can watch the cycle as it
develops in your aquarium and you will see your aquarium mature.
Keep in mind that most serious fish dealers provide free water testing. Take
full advantage of this service, because it allows you to compare the dealer’s
results with those that you’re getting at home.
Write down and date the results of your water testing so that you can follow
the nitrogen cycle. By keeping these records, you will know when the cycle is
firmly established in your aquarium. I even plot my results in a spreadsheet
program, so I can see the rise and fall of ammonia and nitrite — I guess that
makes me officially a fish geek.

Chapter 12: The NIitrogen Cycle

Waiting for Your Aquarium to Mature
When you complete the setup steps in Chapter 11, you have a tank filled with
salt water, but you don’t have the working, well-balanced habitat for fish that
I call an aquarium. To get to this, you need to let the tank mature. And I’m
sorry to say, you have to be a little patient: It’s going to take a few weeks.
Read on for tips on making it happen as fast as possible.
The maturation process means simply that you’re establishing a biological
filter and, therefore, allowing the nitrogen cycle to get going. Nitrogen may
not cycle only once, but you may see multiple cycles as the bioload in your
aquarium is increased. That is, as you increase the number of animals, they
produce more ammonia, which needs to be converted to nitrite, and then
converted to nitrate. So, your aquarium will cycle again. The key is to stimu-
late bacteria growth without overwhelming the system.
You don’t want to add more than a couple of fish to your tank without a work-
ing nitrogen cycle.
Taking the Next Step: Just Add Bacteria
Water circulation, temperature regulation, and filtration help your water
mature, but establishing bacterial colonies sufficient to drive the nitrogen
cycle can take as long as four to five weeks.
After your aquarium is set up, and the components are turned on, the water
maturation process begins. There are a few proven methods for accelerating
this process so that your aquarium doesn’t remain empty for long. Which
method you use depends on how fast ammonia and nitrite levels peak and
then drop. Basically, to move the maturation process along and turn your
infant aquarium into a teenager as fast as possible, you need to add bacteria,
as discussed in the following sections. These methods aren’t mutually exclu-
sive and can be done in conjunction with each other.
Regardless of which method you use to mature your water and establish the
nitrogen cycle, plan on the process taking a minimum of one to six weeks.
Add the rock
The most effective way to speed up water maturation involves the use of live
rock and live sand to seed a new aquarium. As I discuss in Chapters 7 and 9, live
rock and live sand are loaded with helpful bacteria that are already nitrifying the
202
Part III: Taking Proper Care of Your Aquarium 

ammonia being produced by the many critters living on the rock. You can add
live sand and live rock after your tank has been running for about 24 hours, pro-
viding your salinity and temperature have stabilized.
The use of live rock to condition and to filter your aquarium can mature your
aquarium in as little as one or two weeks.
Make sure you use only cured live rock in your new aquarium. See Chapter 9
for details on cured rock.
Seed it
If you’re not going to use live rock or live sand in your aquarium, the next
most effective (and inexpensive) method to establish your nitrogen cycle is
to “seed” the aquarium with bacteria from an already established aquarium.
After your aquarium is set up and filled with water, go to your local pet store
and ask for a handful of gravel from one of their systems that has been well
established. Mix that gravel in with your gravel. This will accelerate water
conditioning by seeding the new system with the right bacteria.
Of course, make sure that the source of your bacteria-rich gravel has healthy
fish and well-maintained aquaria.
You can also seed your filters by adding material from the filter of an estab-
lished aquarium. In fact, you will find that when you clean your filters during
routine maintenance, you’ll want to save some filter media to maintain the
nitrogen cycle and biological filtration in that filter.
Start to stock
Another effective way to jump-start the maturation process is to add a couple
of inexpensive, hardy fishes. The fishes excrete ammonia immediately, and
this provides fuel for the developing colony of bacteria. So, one or two days
after your aquarium has stabilized in terms of temperature and salinity, go
ahead and add a couple of hardy damsels (small fish of the family
Pomacentridae).
When adding fish, start slowly and be conservative. Add the fish, let the
aquarium cycle over a couple of weeks, add a couple more, and repeat the
process. Don’t overwhelm your bacteria with too much ammonia. Patience is
a must.
203
Chapter 12: The NIitrogen Cycle

Accelerators
A number of products on the market today claim to accelerate the matura-
tion process in your aquarium. These typically contain helpful bacteria that
can be used to seed your aquarium. Your dealer will probably strongly rec-
ommend that you use one.
Watch out for claims of super-accelerated water maturation from one of these
acceleration products. Instead, suck it up, be patient, and let your water
mature naturally.
Taking the Final Steps to Maturity
Test your water daily to monitor the nitrogen cycle and other water chem-
istry parameters discussed in Chapter 13. In general, after you’ve seeded the
tank with bacteria, the sequence of events will proceed as follows:
1. After seeding and waiting a couple of days, low values of ammonia begin
to increase, peaking in about seven days.
2. As ammonia builds and the bacterial colony grows, the ammonia is con-
verted to nitrite, and for about a week, the level of ammonia falls as
nitrite increases.
3. As the bacterial population proliferates, ammonia drops out, and nitrite
decreases as nitrification continues. Nitrate slowly builds and stabilizes.
During the cycling process your tank may experience a “brown out,” which is
a fine brown dusting on the gravel and decorations caused by single-celled
algae called diatoms (see Chapter 14). This is a normal occurrence during the
cycling process and will disappear as quickly as it appeared.
The filter bed will not be completely established for several weeks, so be sure
to be conservative when you add your first fish. Start with a low number
(2–4) of peaceful, inexpensive fish. The introduction of territorial fish (see
Chapter 2), may make it difficult to add more fish, because these fish estab-
lish territories and may be aggressive toward new fishes.
In a healthy, mature, well-established marine aquarium, ammonia and nitrite
levels in your water should be close to zero, and nitrate levels should be kept
less than 20 mg/L.
204
Part III: Taking Proper Care of Your Aquarium 

What About Problems?
If something goes wrong, and ammonia doesn’t decrease within two weeks,
don’t panic. Your bioload may be too large, and the bacteria in your tank may
be overwhelmed. The best thing is to just let the tank continue to mature.
Eventually, the bacteria will catch up, and your tank will cycle. However, if
your fish are stressed or dying, you probably need to physically get rid of the
ammonia by conducting a partial water change (see Chapter 15) or using a
commercial ammonia neutralizer available at your dealer.

C
onsider this chapter to be the second major part of your chemistry 
education. In Chapter 12, I discuss the nitrogen cycle thoroughly. In 
this chapter, I address some of the other water chemistry parameters that
you need to measure to monitor the quality of the water in your tank.
The Importance of Water Quality
The quality of the water in your aquarium is the most important part of a
healthy marine environment. That is why I emphasize the importance of
proper filtration in Chapter 7. Fish can live for days without food, but they
will certainly perish in minutes without high water quality.
But how do you determine whether the water in your aquarium is healthy?
Cloudy or discolored water is a dead giveaway, but in most cases you simply
can’t see whether your water is polluted. This is why you want to examine
certain chemical aspects of the water.
Think of test kits as the only way your aquarium water can communicate with
you if something is wrong. When you test the water, you’re the doctor, and
the tests tell you whether your patient is healthy.

In Chapter 9, you find out that test kits are important accessories to add to
your equipment list, and I give you a summary of the kits you need. In this
chapter, I explain what each of these kits actually does.
I try to keep the information in this chapter simple, so that you’re not turned
off by the water chemistry aspects of the hobby. Just the basics here, my
friend. At this stage, you don’t need to be a chemist to be an aquarist.
My friend Rick has the right idea: He set up his aquarium about a year ago.
Allowing for water maturation, he stocked his tank slowly with the right
number of compatible aquarium inhabitants. During this process, he reli-
giously monitored his water quality on a weekly basis, all the while not allow-
ing himself to be obsessed by the chemistry. Rick and his family enjoy their
aquarium, which is well balanced and a picture of beauty. You want to be cog-
nizant of the chemical processes and use them to your advantage. They are a
means of keeping your pets alive.
Checking Your Salt Level
As discussed in Chapter 9, the chemical composition of seawater is extremely
consistent throughout the world. Although it is 96 percent pure water (one
atom of oxygen bonded with two atoms of hydrogen: H2O), it also contains
many dissolved minerals and salts. These minerals and salts are mainly
sodium and chlorine (85 percent), but magnesium, sulphate, calcium, and
potassium make up another 13 percent, and bicarbonate and 68 other ele-
ments make up the remainder in small quantities.
You need to mimic natural seawater as closely as possible in your aquarium,
which means that you need to make sure the amount of salt in your water is
correct. Science has developed a couple of ways to measure the amount of
dissolved salts in seawater. One measure is called salinity and another is
called specific gravity. Although these measurements aren’t the same, either
can be used to determine the correct level of salt in your aquarium.
An affinity for salinity
Salinity refers to the actual concentration of major dissolved ions in the
water, and it is not influenced by temperature. It is expressed as a ratio of
parts-per-thousand (ppt). To directly measure salinity, you need special
equipment, which can be expensive for the average aquarist. But if you
choose to purchase one of these pieces of equipment, a salinity of 34 to 35
ppt is optimal for invertebrates, though fishes can tolerate lower salinities.
208
Part III: Taking Proper Care of Your Aquarium 

Specific gravity
An easier and more practical way to measure the salt level in your tank is to
estimate specific gravity with a hydrometer (see Chapter 9).
Specific gravity refers to the ratio of densities of seawater to pure water at
various temperatures. For example, a specific gravity of 1.021 means that a
liquid is 1.021 times denser than fresh water. However, because the specific
gravity of a liquid is directly related to its temperature, your hydrometer (an
instrument used to measure specific gravity) may not be calibrated to the
temperature in your aquarium. Most hydrometers are calibrated at 60°F
(don’t ask me why), so you need to use a conversion factor to adjust your
hydrometer reading to true specific gravity. The conversion table should be
included with the instructions that come with your hydrometer.
Under standard aquarium temperatures (75°F–79°F), the conversion usually
results in the addition of 0.002 to the hydrometer reading. For example, if
your hydrometer reading is 1.023 and your water temperature is 77°F, the
actual specific gravity of your aquarium is 1.025.
Specific gravity should be established in the range of 1.021 to 1.024, but more
importantly, it should be maintained at a specific level within this range. Even
minor fluctuations can cause problems for your tank inhabitants.
Fluctuating salt
The greatest cause of salt level change is evaporation from the tank. When
water evaporates in a marine aquarium, the salts don’t. They remain in solu-
tion, and therefore the water becomes more concentrated over time, thereby
increasing the salinity and specific gravity. You must monitor water levels in
the aquarium to head off these fluctuations. Evaporation is easily remedied
by adding fresh water, not additional salt water, to the tank.
Don’t wait until water levels have dropped significantly before you top off the
tank with fresh water; instead, do so regularly with small quantities.
Although water evaporation is the major source of fluctuating salt levels, you
may also lose salt from the tank from the protein skimmer (see Chapter 7)
and from crystallization on the hood and other fixtures. Keep an eye on the
hydrometer.
209
Chapter 13: More Chemistry: Salt, Acidity, and Gases 

What Are Acid and pH?
When I write about acid, I’m referring to levels of hydrogen ions in solution.
Ions are simply atoms with an electrical charge. These hydrogen ions are also
called hydrogen protons because they have a positive charge. They are writ-
ten like this: H+. You can measure the number of hydrogen atoms on a scale
called pH. You may have heard of pH in reference to a number of solutions,
ranging from blood to shampoo.
Scaling pH
The pH scale, shown in Figure 13-1, tells you how many hydrogen atoms are
in a solution and, therefore, how acidic it is. It ranges from 0 to 14, with a pH
of 7 being neutral, a pH of 1 being very acidic, and a pH of 14 being very alka-
line, which is the opposite of acidic. The lower the number on the scale, the
more hydrogen atoms are present, and the more acidic the solution is.
The pH scale is logarithmic, which means that each number is ten times
stronger than the preceding number. For example, a pH of 2 is ten times 
more acidic than a pH of 3 and 100 times more acidic than a pH of 4.
Therefore, a single incremental change represents a huge change in the
number of hydrogen protons in your water.

Part III: Taking Proper Care of Your Aquarium 

Salt water is more alkaline than fresh water. If you had a freshwater aquarium,
you probably maintained the pH within the range of 6.5 to 7.5. On the other
hand, the pH of seawater is about 8.2 and should be maintained in the aquar-
ium between 8.1 and 8.3.
Although maintaining the correct pH is important, it is even more critical that
you avoid large changes in pH.
pH fluctuations
A number of factors influence the pH in your aquarium water. These include
the amount of carbon dioxide and fish wastes in the water. The accumulation
of either or both of these will cause the water to acidify and the pH to drop.
In fact, the nitrogen cycle itself will often produce acids that will alter the pH
of your aquarium.
Add a pH test kit to your repertoire of commercial test kits. The kit is simple
to use and is an important step when monitoring the quality of your aquar-
ium water. Monitor this water parameter every week to detect any changes.
An abrupt drop in pH may be indicative of an increase of carbon dioxide or
nitrogenous fish wastes. An increase in aeration and a partial water change
(see Chapter 15) are necessary to alleviate the problem before the lives of
tank inhabitants are compromised.
The ability of a solution to resist changes in pH is called its buffering capacity.
Most commercial salt mixes contain buffers that keep pH from falling dramat-
ically. However, over time, the buffering capacity of your water will diminish,
and carbon dioxide or waste build-up causes pH to drop.
pH solutions
Regular 10-percent water changes (see Chapter 15) will maintain your pH at
correct levels by replenishing your aquarium’s buffering capacity. However, 
if your pH falls rapidly out of the acceptable range, you can restore it by 
 Using a commercially manufactured aquarium buffer. Available at most
aquarium dealers, these chemicals buffer your aquarium when used prop-
erly. Be sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions carefully and use
the buffers in conjunction with a waste-removing partial water change.
 Adding a solution of calcium hydroxide, commonly referred to as 
kalkwasser or limewater. This helps boost calcium levels, thereby
increasing pH.
211
Chapter 13: More Chemistry: Salt, Acidity, and Gases 

Hardness and Alkalinity
The amount of dissolved minerals, namely calcium and magnesium, in the
water is called its hardness. Water with high concentrations of minerals is
said to be hard, whereas low levels are indicative of soft water.
Hardness is easy
Though general hardness is important for the typical freshwater aquarium,
the salt in your marine aquarium dictates the water hardness. So, you really
don’t need to pay much attention to general hardness. However, you don’t
get off the hardness hook that easily. There is a specific kind of hardness
called carbonate hardness that you do need to measure.
Carbonate hardness
In the “What Are Acid and pH?” section earlier, I mention buffering capacity
with regard to the ability of your aquarium water to resist changes in pH.
Remember that pH is really just a measurement of the amount of positively
charged hydrogen atoms in your water. The more positive charges, the more
acidic the water, and the lower the pH.
All these hydrogen protons create a lot of positive charges in the water. The
best way to counteract a positive charge is with a negative charge. So the
water contains molecules and atoms that are negatively charged to buffer the
positive charges. The amount of negative charges and, therefore, the ability
of the water to resist the positive charges make up the buffering capacity.
The negative molecules that are typically found in seawater and that act as
buffers are called carbonates and bicarbonates. Therefore, if you measure the
amount of carbonates in your water, you’re measuring the buffering capacity,
and this is important. If buffering capacity diminishes, your pH will fall, and
problems can occur.
Checking carbonate hardness (alkalinity)
When you measure the amount of carbonates in your aquarium, you’re mea-
suring the carbonate hardness. This is often referred to as measuring the
alkalinity, but don’t get this confused with a pH measurement that is alkaline.
Carbonate hardness does affect pH, but you’re not measuring pH.
212
Part III: Taking Proper Care of Your Aquarium 

Carbonate hardness can be measured with a standard kit that’s available
from your dealer. Keep in mind that it may be called an alkalinity test kit.
Carbonate hardness is usually reported in milli-equivalents per liter (meq/L),
and the level in your aquarium should be greater than 3.0 meq/L.
Adjusting carbonate hardness
If the carbonate hardness (and, therefore, the buffering capacity of your
aquarium water) is below the recommended level, you need to make some
adjustments. In all likelihood, your pH will probably be decreasing, as well. 
In fact, the methods you use to adjust your pH are used to increase your 
carbonate hardness:
 Conduct a partial water change. This will increase the buffering capac-
ity of your water by removing old stale water with fresh buffered salt
water (not fresh water!). This should be your first step. (See Chapter 15
for more on conducting a water change.) Wait a day and then test the
water again. If carbonate hardness is still low, try the next two tips.
 Use a commercially manufactured aquarium buffer. Available at most
aquarium dealers, these chemicals, when used properly, buffer your
aquarium. Be sure to carefully follow the manufacturer’s instructions and
use these in conjunction with a waste-removing partial water change.
 Add a solution of calcium hydroxide or kalkwasser. This increases the
buffering capacity (alkalinity) of your water.
Use calcareous calcium-based substrates (gravels; see Chapter 9) in your
saltwater aquarium because they interact with the carbon dioxide excreted
by your pets, increasing the buffering capacity of the water.
Water Gases
Through the process of respiration, we use oxygen and produce carbon diox-
ide when we breathe. These molecules are well known by most people simply
because without them, we would certainly perish. Well, our marine friends
are just like us in this respect.
Oxygen (O2)
Like most living creatures, marine fish and invertebrates need oxygen to 
live. Whereas humans can breathe oxygen from the air, marine critters must
extract it from the water. Therefore, they need oxygen that’s dissolved in
water, called dissolved oxygen.
213
Chapter 13: More Chemistry: Salt, Acidity, and Gases 

Most oxygen exchange occurs at your aquarium’s surface where the water
meets the air. You can increase the amount of dissolved oxygen in your
aquarium by agitating the surface area of the tank through increased circula-
tion. This process is called aeration. As I discuss in Chapter 7, aeration and
circulation go hand in hand. To maintain high levels of dissolved oxygen in
your aquarium, you need to aerate the water.
Despite what most people think, air delivered by airstones and diffusers help
to increase circulation to enhance oxygen exchange at the surface, but don’t
contribute much oxygen directly to the water.
Test kits and electronic probes are available to measure the amount of dis-
solved oxygen in your aquarium, but only reef tank enthusiasts should con-
sider buying one. If you use a test kit, make sure that dissolved oxygen levels
are maintained above 7.0 mg/L.
Carbon dioxide (CO2)
Oxygen in, carbon dioxide out. That is how a living, respiring system works.
For every molecule of dissolved oxygen that you want in your tank, carbon
dioxide will be produced when it is utilized by your critters.
In your aquarium, carbon dioxide combines with water molecules and calcium
in a dynamic equilibrium that produces hydrogen protons, bicarbonate ions,
and calcium carbonate. Without going into great detail using chemical equa-
tions and lots of capital letters, realize that the levels of these compounds are
influenced by the amount of carbon dioxide production (respiration) in your
aquarium.
Carbon dioxide can profoundly affect your water quality. Excessive amounts
lower your pH; however, it also affects the buffering capacity of your water to
lower your carbonate hardness. Moreover, carbon dioxide also affects cal-
cium levels in your water, and as discussed in the “Calcium (Ca)” section,
later in this chapter, you need high calcium levels for your invertebrates.
The bottom line: Carbon dioxide is a product of metabolism that needs to be
removed from your aquarium. However, test kits for carbon dioxide are not
common, and the best ways to keep carbon dioxide levels low are as follows:
 Maintain high levels of aeration and circulation so that carbon dioxide is
removed from the water.
 Conduct regular partial water changes to physically remove carbon
dioxide (see Chapter 15).
214
Part III: Taking Proper Care of Your Aquarium 

 To limit carbon dioxide production, don’t overstock your aquarium with
inhabitants.
 Maintain proper pH levels.
 Allow some growth of algae, which remove some of the carbon dioxide
(see Chapter 14).
 Don’t overfeed your pets.
Considering Other Chemical Factors
A number of water tests are available to the average aquarist, so you may 
be a bit confused in the beginning. In Chapter 9, I list those tests that may 
be useful to you, depending on whether you have a fish-only or a reef tank. I
discuss a few of these parameters throughout this chapter, and I cover a few
more here.
Calcium (Ca)
You may recall from Chapter 4 that many invertebrate species, such as corals
and snails, possess calcium carbonate skeletons and shells. Therefore, for
these animals to thrive and grow, they need to extract calcium from the water.
As you can probably guess, the level of calcium in the water is important to
know if you keep a reef tank. If you have a fish-only aquarium, the calcium
levels in your water are adequately maintained by your partial water changes.
Calcium test kits are available, and levels should be maintained at 375 to 475
ppm (parts per million) in the reef aquarium. If testing indicates that you
don’t have enough calcium in the water, add calcium supplements, such as
limewater, to the aquarium. These supplements are commercially available
and should be administered slowly.
Phosphate (PO4)
Dissolved inorganic phosphorous, also called phosphate, enters your aquar-
ium primarily through excretion by fishes, the breakdown of uneaten food,
and tap water. These phosphates are readily absorbed by growing algae. In
most cases, phosphate isn’t a problem until excessive algal growth occurs on
the live corals of a reef aquarium.
215
Chapter 13: More Chemistry: Salt, Acidity, and Gases 

Therefore, make efforts to monitor levels of phosphate with a test kit. A phos-
phate level in excess of 0.10 ppm causes an algal bloom, so reduce phosphate
levels by increasing aeration and using a protein skimmer (see Chapter 7).
Maintain a phosphate level less than 0.05 ppm.
Phosphate becomes bound to organic matter that binds to rising air 
bubbles. When the bubbles burst at the surface, the phosphates are 
lost to the atmosphere.
Copper (Cu)
Even though you make every effort to maintain a healthy aquarium, eventu-
ally one of your fish will need to be treated for disease (see Chapter 18). The
most effective treatment for many parasitic infestations is copper. I prefer to
treat diseased fish in a separate hospital aquarium, but some fishkeepers add
copper directly to their aquariums.
In the aquarium, copper readily binds to calcium carbonates and becomes
ineffective, so copper levels need to be maintained continuously. At the same
time, excessive copper is toxic to fish.
Copper levels in your aquarium should be tested during the treatment period
to maintain adequate levels while avoiding excessive treatment.
Copper is toxic to invertebrates, so if you keep invertebrates, don’t use
copper. Many houses, particularly older ones, have copper pipes that may,
on occasion, leach out enough copper to be toxic to many invertebrates. If
your home has copper pipes, it is worthwhile to have a copper test kit to
make sure your tap water is safe.

All About Algae
In This Chapter
 Discovering the hoopla about algae
 Understanding how and when you should control algae
 Recognizing that all algae are not alike
P
lants are an integral part of the freshwater aquarium but are somewhat
rare in the saltwater tank. This is because, with few exceptions, all the
ocean’s plant life is classified in the primitive group known as algae. The 
term seaweed actually refers to the many-celled forms of algae.
Algae can be either good or bad for the marine aquarist, depending on
whether or not they get out of control. In moderation, algae assimilate
nitrates and other excess nutrients from the water and provide food for 
herbivorous fishes and invertebrates. This chapter explains the pros and
cons of the algae in your aquarium. The latter part of the chapter reviews 
the types of algae, including those that you want to keep.
What Are Algae?
Algae are photosynthetic organisms that occur throughout the world in 
many habitats ranging from fresh water to salt water and from the poles to
the equator. For many years, algae were grouped with the fungi into the class
of plants known as Thallophyta. Later, some scientists classified these plant-
like organisms into their own kingdom, called the Protoctista, and the fungi
into their own kingdom called Fungi. Most recently, however, the term algae
is used to describe a very diverse assemblage of photosynthetic organisms
that does not include land plants. This is a pretty broad definition, but the
rest of this chapter gives you a sense of just how different the various kinds
of algae actually are.

Algae are relatively simple organisms that range in size from the one-celled
microscopic types to large seaweeds that grow to over 230 feet. Algae are
also hardy organisms that have a tremendous reproductive capacity. They
can enter your aquarium as algal spores borne by the air or carried by tank
furnishings from another aquarium.
The term alga is singular, and more than one alga is called algae.
Algae have adapted to all kinds of water conditions. They are important 
as primary producers at the base of the food chain. Although they provide
oxygen and food for aquatic life, some forms of algae can contribute to the
mass mortality of other organisms. In tropical regions, coralline algae can 
be as dominant as corals in the formation of reefs.
Algae can be planktonic, meaning they float freely in the ocean, and when
they do they’re called microalgae. The term seaweed refers to larger species
of algae, called macroalgae, that live in the marine environment attached to
the bottom. Despite their size, which (as mentioned) can exceed 200 feet,
seaweeds are simple organisms that aren’t well understood. They don’t have
roots and shoots the way that plants do, but they do have root-like attach-
ment structures and leaf-like fronds.
In your aquarium, algae can be found on the water’s surface, suspended in
the water, or on the surfaces of the aquarium glass, rocks, gravel, coral, and
tank decorations. Many species are introduced on live rock or coral, but
some enter your aquarium with water from other aquariums and as spores.
You can also purchase seaweeds from your dealer to add plant-like décor to
your aquarium.
For all their diversity, all aquarium algae have one thing in common: They
need light and nutrients to propagate.
Light and nutrients
Whether or not algae are plants, they act like them. They need light to grow
and prosper just like your favorite backyard tree does. And like that same
tree, nutrients like nitrates and phosphates are the fertilizers that form the
building blocks of algae. In your aquarium, these natural ingredients are well
represented. Strong lighting and nitrate from the nitrogen cycle fuel the prop-
agation of algae.
In addition, algae are photosynthetic, so they utilize carbon dioxide and con-
vert it into oxygen. (Chapter 13 tells you that the reduction of carbon dioxide
in your aquarium is a good thing.) However, this characteristic is a double-
edged sword because algae need light to photosynthesize, and at night they
respire, producing carbon dioxide.
218
Part III: Taking Proper Care of Your Aquarium 

Algae act as convenient repositories that can be used to remove excess nutri-
ents from your aquarium. By routinely scraping some (not all!) of your algae
from the tank, you are physically getting nitrates, phosphates, and other
nutrients out your tank.
So far, everything in this chapter shows that algae are good for the saltwater
aquarium. So why do a lot of people think that algae are a nuisance?
The sterility syndrome
The primary reason that people find algae to be a problem is associated
with what I call the sterility syndrome. Many new aquarists think that a sterile-
looking aquarium is a clean and healthy aquarium, so they remove as much
of the algae as they can at all times to keep the tank clean-looking. Well,
this belief couldn’t be further from the truth. Next time you go snorkeling
or diving in the ocean, look closely at the rocks, coral, and sand: You’ll see
algae literally covering all the exposed surfaces.
Algae are an integral part of the natural coral reef ecosystem. Many species
of fish and invertebrates feed exclusively on algae, and some important
species of algae actually live inside some invertebrates, providing them food
(see Chapter 4). Unfortunately, even in the wild, excess algal growth can
smother a coral reef ecosystem. Rising water temperatures associated with
global changes in climate have promoted the suffocating effects of algae and
resulted in the loss of coral reefs worldwide.
Don’t succumb to the sterility syndrome. Get used to seeing algae and pro-
moting algal growth in your aquarium, yet routinely remove some of it to
maintain a clear view of your pets and to get rid of excess nutrients.
Algae Are Out of Control
As in the wild, at some point your aquarium algae may get out of control.
Excessive algae literally choke an aquarium by consuming oxygen during the
night and covering live corals and live rock. They clog your filter system and
obscure your vision by obscuring the walls of your tank. You can physically
remove the excess algae, but this will only remove the symptom and not
solve the problem.
219
Chapter 14: All About Algae

Go to the source
When the algae in your aquarium become a nuisance, consider this a sign
that something is wrong in your aquarium. Algae need light and nutrients to
propagate in your aquarium, so when algae become a nuisance, check these
factors.
First, check your light levels: Is your aquarium too close to a window, allow-
ing for excess sunlight? Is your light being kept on too long? Are you using
the correct kind of lighting? How old is your light source? The quality of a
light will degrade as it ages, and this may contribute to your algae problem.
In most cases, excess algal growth is caused by a problem with nutrient
levels. In other words, there is too much fertilizer in your tank. Now is the
time to check your water chemistry, looking at the factors that I outline in
Chapters 12 and 13. Start with the nitrate and then check pH, carbonate hard-
ness, and phosphate. Have you conducted routine water changes (see
Chapter 15)? Is your circulation and aeration adequate (see Chapter 9)?
Check your filtration, as well.
If you find that one or more of these parameters is out of balance, take steps
to remedy them. Flip to Chapters 12 and 13 to determine how to solve your
water problems.
Feed some fish
One of the best and most enjoyable ways to control algae is to stock your
aquarium with algae-eating critters. In Chapters 2 and 3, I introduced a
number of species of fish and invertebrates that eat algae. Among those
species that readily consume algae are the following:
 Blennies
 Tangs
 Snails
 Sea urchins
 Hermit crabs
Harvest time
At some point, removing algae will become a part of your routine maintenance.
Even if it’s not out of control, algae will cover your glass and obstruct the view
of your pets. In Chapter 9, I recommend the purchase of algae scrubbers and
tube brushes to remove algae.
220
Part III: Taking Proper Care of Your Aquarium 

If beneficial green algae are excessive, simply remove them from the aquar-
ium fixtures by rinsing. A vacuum will help remove algae from the gravel. If
the excessive algae are the blue-green slime algae, make every effort to
remove all the algae and the causes of it. Poor water quality must be
improved. Test the water, conduct a partial water change (see Chapter 15),
and check the operation of your filters. The next section of this chapter helps
you discriminate among different types of algae.
Removing algae is a great way to remove excess nutrients from your aquarium,
but if the algae are the beneficial variety, don’t fall into the sterility syndrome
and remove them all.
Knowing Your Algae
One thing is certain, not all algae are alike. Although a number of formal clas-
sifications have been set up for algae, and scientists recognize at least eight
major divisions, not all occur in the typical aquarium. Some kinds are desir-
able, and others are not. Some are typically referred to as seaweeds, others
are planktonic, and some are both.
There is really no point in reviewing all the various kinds of algae, so the 
following sections concentrate only on those that you’re most likely to
encounter or purchase for your marine aquarium.
Green algae
Once called the Chlorophyta, green algae have now been technically 
separated into several groups including Prasinophytes, Chlorophyceae,
Trebouxiophyceae, Ulvophyceae, and Charophyceae, but green algae is a
much easier term to remember. With over 7,000 species, this is the most
diverse group of algae, but only about ten percent of the green algae are
marine forms. These are typically the most beneficial of the algae, although
some species are less desirable. They are green in color because their chloro-
phyll pigments are identical to those of higher plants.
Although many green algae are seaweeds, the planktonic spores of some
species are not visible to the naked eye but appear as a green cloudiness in
the water. These algae sometimes form a green film on the aquarium glass.
Larger green algae species may come in desirable plant-like shapes or less
desirable hair and mat-like forms. The most attractive species of green algae
are cultivated and sold as attractive additions to your aquarium.
221
Chapter 14: All About Algae

The following types of green algae are popular:
 Caulerpa spp: This is the most popular and common genus of green
algae in the aquarium. Members of this group come in a variety of colors
ranging from lime green to bluish brown. They typically have a single
stalk with blade-like leaves. These prolific algae are cultivated and
offered by many marine aquarium dealers.
 Halimeda spp: Unlike the Caulerpa, members of this genus are calcare-
ous, meaning they contain calcium. They resemble underwater cacti
growing as a series of circular flat plates. After death, the white calcium
from these algae contributes to the sparkling white sand that you see on
Caribbean beaches. In the aquarium, they are indicative of a healthy
environment.
 Valonia spp: These species of algae are called bubble algae because
they form clusters of spherical bubbles. Although they have an attrac-
tive silver appearance, bubble algae can overgrow an aquarium and
should be watched closely and regularly cropped.
Hair algae are less desirable. These algae form thick, hair-like mats that can
carpet your aquarium. For a fish-only tank, this matting will be simply ugly,
but in the reef tank, it can smother and kill live corals. Make efforts to control
hair algae.
Red algae
This group of algae, called the Rhodophyta, contains about 6,000 species, and
many are marine seaweeds. Although most red algae are multicellular and
grow attached to rocks and other algae, there are some single-celled forms.
Red algae are red because of the pigment called phycoerythin, which absorbs
blue light and reflects red light. Their coloration, which depends on how
much of this pigment they have, ranges from reddish yellow to bright red to
greenish blue and brown. Because blue light penetrates much deeper than
red light, these algae typically live at deeper depths and are well adapted to
low lighting conditions.
A lot of red algae are introduced into the aquarium on live rocks. The most
common are called coralline red algae, which secrete a hard calcareous shell
the way corals do. These algae are considered important in the formation of
tropical reefs and, in some areas, may contribute more to reef structure than
corals do. They are beneficial to an aquarium, encrusting rocks and even
spreading to the fixtures and glass.
222
Part III: Taking Proper Care of Your Aquarium 

Brown algae
Belonging to the Phaeophyta group, the brown algae comprise about 3,000
species that are predominantly marine seaweeds. There are no single-celled
forms of brown algae (the simplest is a branched filamentous organism,
which is technical information that you don’t need to remember).
Their brown coloration results from the dominance of a xanthophyll pigment,
which masks other pigments including chlorophyll. Colors of brown algae
range from pale beige to yellow-brown to almost black.
The most common brown algae, called kelp, are the largest algae, the ones
that attain lengths greater than 200 feet. The giant kelp forms expansive sea-
weed forests off the coast of North America and provides habitat and shelter
for many organisms. Tropical waters have fewer species of brown algae.
Some forms of brown algae come attached to live rock when you purchase 
it. Like the red algae, brown algae are generally beneficial for a saltwater
aquarium.
Diatoms
These algae are microscopic cells composed of overlapping half shells of
silica. These are the diatoms, planktonic and benthic algae that spend their
lives floating in the ocean or in the sediments. Their silica shells, called frus-
tules, are remarkably geometric in shape, but their microscopic size makes
them difficult for the average aquarist to see.
In the ocean, diatoms form a major part of the “plant-plankton” called phyto-
plankton, providing important food for the “animal-plankton” called zooplank-
ton. Chapter 7 discusses how the frustules of diatoms are used in diatom
filters as filter media.
These algae proliferate in aquariums with high nitrate levels. They are usually
the first algae to establish themselves. Diatoms form a brown slime on the
gravel, rocks, decorations, and aquarium glass. Heavy concentrations of
diatoms discolor the water. As the aquarium matures, these algae should 
disappear. Until they do, you can scrape them away to keep a clear view of
your aquarium pets.
223
Chapter 14: All About Algae

Dinoflagellates
Members of this group are single-celled organisms that have the characteris-
tics of both plants and animals, but they are still considered algae. Although it
sounds like a prehistoric reptile, the name dinoflagellate actually refers to their
forward swimming motion created by their tails, which are called flagella.
Not all species of dinoflagellates are photosynthetic, and some species are
planktonic, while others are benthic; that is, they live on the bottom. Some
species of dinoflagellates are harmful to sea life and those that eat it.
Dinoflagellate blooms, called red-tide, turn coastal waters reddish-brown, 
producing serious toxins that can affect human health.
In some instances, excess nutrient levels cause dinoflagellate blooms in your
aquarium. This results in brown mucous slime covering most of the tank and
its contents. If this happens, the algae must be physically removed with a
siphon, and you should conduct a 50 percent water change (see Chapter 15).
The dinoflagellates that are of greatest interest to aquarists are those that
live in live corals, sponges, clams, and anemones. These are called zooxan-
thellae, and I discuss them in Chapter 4. These algae form a symbiotic relation-
ship with their hosts, providing beneficial organic carbon that they produce
by photosynthesis.
If you’re an invertebrate enthusiast, make sure you have sufficient lighting to
keep zooxanthellae dinoflagellates alive. If they die, in all likelihood, their
host will die.
Blue-green algae
The blue-green algae are technically not algae at all: They are bacteria. For
years, they were considered algae because they are aquatic and make their
own food. This group of bacteria is called the Cyanobacteria, and it has the
distinction of being the oldest known group of organisms at more than 3.5 
billion years old. Because they are bacteria, blue-green algae are small and
single-celled, but they grow in large enough colonies that you can see them.
Although called blue-green algae, they can have colors ranging from black to
red to purple.
They may be earth’s bacterial heroes, but when these algae are in your
aquarium they can be both good and bad. Like a lot of bacteria, blue-green
algae in your substrate are beneficial to the health of your aquarium, feasting
224
Part III: Taking Proper Care of Your Aquarium 

on detritus (organic wastes). However, in cases of poor water quality, high
nutrients, and poor circulation, they form a dark brownish-red gelatinous
mat, called red slime, on rocks, gravel, and plants in your tank. They are also
capable of producing toxins that poison aquarium fish. If allowed to prolifer-
ate, they smother the tank. Unfortunately, few critters feed on blue-green
algae, so they must be physically removed with a siphon during a partial
water change.
There are several products on the market to help eliminate slime algae, 
but the key is to stay on top of your water chemistry, water changes, and
water motion.

Chapter 15
Keeping Your Aquarium Clean 
In This Chapter
 Doing preventative maintenance
 Developing your daily, weekly, and monthly duties
 Responding to emergencies
A
fish living in the open ocean isn’t generally too concerned about water
quality. Waste products and detritus are, after all, diluted by massive
amounts of water. In the closed aquarium system, however, this is not the
case. You must keep the aquarium clean.
Preventative maintenance, my friend — that’s what keeping an aquarium is
all about. You know that your house, your car, and even your body benefit
from routine care and maintenance. Everything lasts a lot longer with fewer
problems. Your marine aquarium is no exception.
Ben Franklin said, “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.”
Aquariums are a great example of how true Franklin’s axiom is. This chapter
tells you how a little work every day will keep your aquarium healthy in the
long run.
Performing the Basics
Cleaning an aquarium involves a conscientious effort on your part. In fact,
maintaining a fish tank is not for the lazy at heart. Don’t set up a saltwater
aquarium if you don’t intend to follow through and keep it clean and healthy.
All too often, an aquarist’s interest wanes after the first couple of months of
ownership, and the aquarium occupants ultimately suffer the consequences.
Realize that going into this hobby requires a real commitment on your part.
Concern must be shown at every step and on every level. Your fishes’ lives
depend on your attention to detail.

If you’re a parent, and your child has an aquarium, it’s your responsibility to
help him or her maintain the aquarium. Make a game out of it and try to keep
it fun. As soon as it starts to feel like work, you’re on your own.
There are basic tasks that you should tend to on a regular basis. They are
listed as follows, and I cover them in detail in the following sections.
 Vacuum the gravel.
 Clean and maintain the filters.
 Test your water quality.
 Conduct partial water changes.
In the “Sticking to Your Maintenance Schedule” section later in the chapter, I
give you a schedule for some of these tasks, but this is not set in stone, and
you should customize the schedule as you see fit. The frequency with which
you clean your aquarium depends on how dirty it gets, and that depends on
the number of occupants, the quality of your filtration, and the amount of
food that is left to foul your tank.
Sucking it up
Vacuuming is one of the most important parts of maintaining your tank. You
must reduce the accumulation of detritus in the gravel so that your biological
filters are not overwhelmed.
Detritus is the combination of fish wastes and uneaten food that sinks to and
decays on the bottom of the aquarium. If not removed, this organic waste
breaks down into ammonia and overwhelms the nitrogen cycle. This result
will, in turn, disturb your water chemistry, snowballing into a series of prob-
lems that will ultimately harm your fish and invertebrates.
Detritus can be particularly damaging to an undergravel filter. Too much
clogs the undergravel filter, preventing water flow through the gravel and
reducing the filter’s ability to do its job.
Aquarium vacuums, sometimes called substrate cleaners, are commercially
available at your aquarium dealer. Chapter 9 addresses the kinds of gravel
vacuums available to the aquarist.
Although an aquarium vacuum is a nice piece of equipment, the old-fash-
ioned garden hose works to siphon wastes, as well (see the section
“Siphoning water” later in this chapter).
228
Part III: Taking Proper Care of Your Aquarium 

The most efficient way to vacuum your aquarium is while conducting a water
change, because water is removed in the process anyway. This accomplishes
two goals at once: vacuuming detritus and removing water from the tank for
replacement. Follow the steps in the “Changing the water” section later in
this chapter to vacuum your aquarium while changing your water.
When you vacuum, make sure you gently rake the gravel. If you have an
undergravel filter, don’t mix it up too aggressively or you may disrupt the
filter bed.
Cleaning your filters
As I discuss in Chapter 7, many filters have their own maintenance schedule.
The level to which you “clean” your filter depends on the kind of filtration
that it provides. A filter that’s strictly mechanical can be cleaned thoroughly
to remove debris, whereas a biological filter should not be touched except to
remove large detritus. Somewhere in the middle is the chemical filter, which
should be recharged every month.
Don’t forget what I tell you in Chapter 7 about the function of a filter. Filters
remove wastes from the aquarium and either retain them (mechanical and
chemical filtration) or convert them to less harmful compounds (biological
filtration). With the exception of the natural biological filtration of live rock,
wastes accumulate in most filters until you remove them by cleaning.
In the following sections, I touch briefly on each filter that I describe in
Chapter 7, giving you a maintenance routine.
Inside box filter
Although you may not be using inside box filters except in a quarantine tank
(see Chapter 5), they are easily maintained. Simply replace the activated
carbon and the filter floss every month, retaining about half of the latter for
the bacteria that they harbor.
Sponge filter
Because the sponge in this type of filter provides the filter medium for
mechanical and biological filtration, there are no other media to change.
Sponge filters are easy to maintain by rinsing them in water every two weeks
to a month, but be careful not to wash them out too thoroughly (keep those
bacteria!).
229
Chapter 15: Keeping Your Aquarium Clean 

Undergravel filter
After a healthy undergravel filtration system is established, this filter can 
be used indefinitely without being disassembled and cleaned. There is no
filter floss or carbon to change, and the only medium is the gravel itself.
Nonetheless, debris does accumulate in the gravel, so the gravel needs to 
be vacuumed to keep the filter from clogging. This vacuuming is done with
routine partial water changes every two weeks (more on this in the
“Changing the water” section, later in this chapter).
Every month, make sure that you check the airstones that power your under-
gravel filter and replace them if they’re clogged or crumbling. If you have
powerheads, make sure the intakes are clear and the impeller inside is clean.
I like to take them apart every month and clean the moving non-electrical
parts under running tap water.
Power filters
Power filters are easy to maintain. Most have cartridges that can be replaced
every two to four weeks, depending on bioload (see Chapter 12) and waste
accumulation. However, make every effort to retain 50 percent of the used
filter media or use a sponge type medium so helpful bacteria are not lost. If
your filter has two cartridges, alternate their replacement so bacteria are
always present. Activated carbon should be replaced every month, as well.
If your filter is equipped with a biowheel, you can retain bacteria even though
you have to replace the internal filter media. Biowheels don’t need to be
cleaned.
Filter impellers should be cleaned every month under running tap water so
that they continue to run efficiently.
Canister filters
The canister filter contains compartments with various kinds of filter media,
like activated carbon, filter sponges, filter floss, and ceramic bodies. The use
of multiple filter media allows valuable bacteria to be retained when the filter
is cleaned every month, depending on waste accumulation and bioload.
When the canister filter is cleaned, the activated carbon is replaced, the
ceramic bodies and filter sponges are rinsed and retained, and 50 percent 
of the filter floss is replaced.
The number of filter components depends on the brand of canister filter —
many are available. Read the manufacturer’s instructions and follow its 
recommended maintenance schedule.
Don’t forget to check those impellers and clean them, as well.
230
Part III: Taking Proper Care of Your Aquarium 

Trickle filters
Trickle filters offer great advantages over other filter systems relative to 
filtration efficiency and effectiveness. In addition, they require little mainte-
nance. Like the canister filters, you can find many brands, and the level to
which you clean them depends on their components. Every month, replace
the carbon and rinse the sponges and filter pads. Bioballs and ceramic
bodies can be rinsed every six months to a year.
Live rock
The natural biological filtration of live rock needs little to no maintenance. As
long as the aquarium remains healthy and circulation is maintained, live rock
is self-cleaning and self-perpetuating. That’s why this natural choice of filtra-
tion is becoming so popular.
Protein skimmers
Daily checks are required for the protein skimmer to make sure that it’s work-
ing properly and to empty the collection cup if needed. Airflow components,
like airstones, air ports, and tubing, should be checked regularly and then
cleaned and replaced as needed. Every month, clean the powerhead or water
pump impellers, as well.
Follow the maintenance schedule of your manufacturer so that your protein
skimmer is kept running efficiently.
Testing, testing, testing (your water)
If you read Chapters 12, 13, or 14, you’re probably getting sick of my writing
about testing your water. But I can’t impress upon you enough the need to keep
an eye on your aquarium’s health through routine water chemistry testing.
When you first set up your aquarium, testing the water every day is critical 
to monitoring the water-maturation process. As you begin to add fish, water
chemistry will change radically, and water-quality monitoring is critical to the
survival of your fish. After this sensitive period, which can last several weeks,
it is still important to test your water. I recommend that you do so at least
once every week. This will give you a good understanding of the mechanics
of the nitrogen cycle and will tell you when the nitrates, carbonate hardness,
pH, and other parameters are to the point at which a water change is needed.
Look out for sudden behavioral changes in your fish, fish disease, fish mortal-
ity, excessive algal growth, smelly water, and cloudy water. All these warrant
an immediate water-quality test and possible water change.
231
Chapter 15: Keeping Your Aquarium Clean 

As I discuss in Chapter 12, the results of your water testing should be written
down and compared to previous test results. If there has been a dramatic
change since the last test in any water parameter, action may be required 
as follows:
 If the pH is too low, conduct a water change, and see Chapter 13 for
more information on how to raise it.
 If the ammonia, nitrite, or nitrate is too high, conduct a water change
and see Chapter 12 for more information.
 If carbonate hardness is too low, conduct a water change and see
Chapter 13 for more information.
 If your salinity or specific gravity is too high or too low, see Chapter 13
for information on how to adjust it.
Changing the water
Water changes are one of the most important aspects of cleaning and main-
taining your aquarium. Waste products build slowly in your aquarium and the
resilience of your water is slowly depleted (see Chapters 12 and 13). The only
way to solve both of these problems is to physically change your water,
removing the wastes and replenishing valuable trace elements.
Deciding how much and how often
The typical preventative water change usually involves 10 to 20 percent of
the tank’s volume being replaced with properly balanced premixed seawater.
The added water, which should be the correct specific gravity, will replace
exhausted trace elements and nutrients, as well. The amount you change
varies with the quality of your water, the aquarium’s bioload (number of 
critters), and the frequency of water changes.
Some experts feel that a 10 percent water change is sufficient every two
weeks, whereas others feel that this volume should be 20 percent. If your
aquarium is crowded, your son Luke has a tendency to overfeed the fishes, 
or you’re unable to change your water frequently, a 20 percent change is in
order. However, if your aquarium isn’t heavily stocked, you’re careful when
you feed, and you’re religious about water changes, 10 percent should be 
sufficient.
I recommend that you start with a water change of 10 percent every two to
four weeks and modify it either up or down depending on the type of filtra-
tion and water quality. For example, a 55-gallon saltwater aquarium with a
trickle filter (wet/dry filter) and a protein skimmer can go four to six weeks
between 15 percent and 20 percent water changes.
232
Part III: Taking Proper Care of Your Aquarium 

Siphoning water
The best way to conduct a water change is to use an aquarium vacuum 
and a large plastic bucket. The vacuum has a large diameter tube attached 
to a siphon. The siphon is used to draw water from the aquarium, while the
vacuum is thrust into the substrate, stirring the gravel and allowing detritus
to flow out with the water into the bucket.
The surface gravel should be stirred during every partial water change for
two reasons.
 If you have an undergravel filter, stirring breaks up impacted areas in the
filter bed where water flow has become restricted.
 Stirring puts detritus into suspension where it can be siphoned out with
the old water.
When you change the water, make every effort to efficiently cover as much of
the substrate as possible, but don’t rush over spots. If you can’t cover it all,
make a mental note where you left off and start at that spot with the next
water change.
These steps explain how to siphon:
1. Fill the tube completely with water, making sure no air is trapped in
the tube.
Make sure the siphon and your hands are clean. You can fill the hose by
submerging it in the aquarium, but do this only if your aquarium is large
enough to accommodate the hose without spooking the fish. Otherwise,
place one end of the tube in the tank, put your mouth on the other, and
draw the aquarium water that way to start the flow.
2. Make sure the bucket end is lower than the aquarium, or siphoning
will not work.
If you filled your siphon in the aquarium, plug one end of the hose
tightly with your thumb, lift it from the aquarium, and bring it lower
than the tank to the bucket.
3. Release your thumb, and the water will begin to flow rapidly from the
aquarium into the bucket.
You can control the water flow by pinching the hose.
4. Discard the water in the bucket.
Figure 15-1 illustrates both siphoning water to and from the tank.
233
Chapter 15: Keeping Your Aquarium Clean 

Adding water
When you need to add water, make sure you use premixed and conditioned
saltwater that you store in a cool, dark place. Aerate the water for about 15
minutes before conducting the water change (see Chapter 7).
To add water, pour the premixed and conditioned water slowly into your
tank, making sure not to disrupt the aquarium or its inhabitants.
Make sure the water you add is the same temperature and specific gravity as
that in your aquarium.
Water out of your tap may be loaded with chlorine, chloramine, heavy metals,
phosphates, and other ions. Many of these compounds are harmful to fish, so
they need to be removed. This process is called water conditioning. It doesn’t
hurt to read the water-mixing sections in Chapter 9 to review how to premix
and condition salt water.
Your local water company routinely checks the water supply for these com-
pounds. Check with them to find out what’s in your tap water.

Part III: Taking Proper Care of Your Aquarium 

Topping off
Don’t confuse water changes with adding water that has evaporated from 
the aquarium. Depending on the amount of aeration and circulation that you
have (see Chapter 7), you may have more or less water evaporation. When
water evaporates, dissolved salts are left behind, and the specific gravity of
the water increases.
Pay attention to this process, because changes in specific gravity cause
severe problems for your tank’s inhabitants.
Water evaporation is readily solved by adding fresh water, not premixed con-
ditioned saltwater, to your aquarium. The water you add should be condi-
tioned tap water. If you don’t have a lot of evaporation, the use of
store-bought distilled water relieves you of the need to condition the water.
Distilled water is pure water, that is, pure H2O without additives and toxic
compounds.
Many aquarium shops sell filtered water specifically for saltwater aquariums.
Sticking to Your Maintenance Schedule
The list in this section gives you a rough guideline for keeping up with pre-
ventative maintenance. Use this as a starting point and fine-tune it to fit your
needs and those of your new pets. Most of these steps are self-explanatory,
requiring just a few minutes of your time.
Every day
Every day, do the following:
 Turn the aquarium lights on and off. Most aquarists prefer to use an
automatic timer. If you choose not to, try to turn the lights on and off in
a consistent pattern.
 Check your fish and invertebrates for signs of stress, disease, or death.
Be prepared to remove or treat fish that aren’t well.
 Feed the fishes and invertebrates twice a day, removing any uneaten food.
 Conduct water tests until the water matures and the nitrogen cycle is
established. Routine tests include ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, and pH.
Record the test results.
235
Chapter 15: Keeping Your Aquarium Clean 

 Check the water temperature and specific gravity or salinity. Adjust the
heater, as needed.
 Empty the protein skimmer collection cup, as needed.
 Check the water level and top off, as needed.
 Check all aquarium systems: heater, filters, aerators, protein skimmer.
Make sure they’re running properly and smoothly and pay special 
attention to intakes and siphon tubes. Make sure nothing is leaking.
Every week
Once a week, complete the following tasks:
 Remove excess algae, keeping beneficial algae at acceptable levels and
getting rid of nuisance algae (see Chapter 14).
 Clean the glass, both inside and out, but don’t use glass cleaner. Remove
salt-creep deposits.
 Conduct water tests weekly after the water matures and the nitrogen
cycle is established. Record all test results and add trace elements and
buffers, as needed.
Every two weeks
Every two weeks, do the following:
 Clean filters, as needed. Partially change or rinse the filter media on some
filters if the bioload is high, the media is dirty, or the flow is restricted.
 Change 10 percent of the tank water while vacuuming the gravel.
Monthly
Every month, be sure you complete these tasks:
 Conduct thorough filter checks. Replace the filter carbon and rinse the
filter media and components, as needed and depending on bioload.
 Clean the protein skimmer.
 Clean the outside of aquarium, removing salt and calcium deposits, dust,
and dirt.
 Rinse any tank decorations that suffer from excess algae.
236
Part III: Taking Proper Care of Your Aquarium 

Quarterly (every three months)
Every three months, conduct a thorough examination of all aquarium sys-
tems, including lighting, heating, filtration, aeration pumps, and tubing.
Replace or clean parts, as needed.
Taking Care of Emergencies
This section makes me cringe as I write it. Nobody likes to think of extreme
situations when something goes terribly wrong with an aquarium or the sys-
tems that keep it going. But, like all preventative maintenance, contingency
plans must be in place, and you need to know how to keep your pets alive.
What do I mean by emergencies? The most common are power failure, 
water leaks, overheating, and pollution, and each is discussed in the 
following sections.
By definition, you never really know when an emergency is going to strike. 
If you did, it wouldn’t be an emergency. One thing I’ve done is establish an
arrangement with my dealer, Condo. He temporarily houses my fish and
invertebrates during extreme emergencies.
Pay particular attention to your fish and invertebrates after any kind of emer-
gency. These kinds of events cause extreme stress, which can, in turn, lead to
disease that will become apparent over the following two weeks.
237
Chapter 15: Keeping Your Aquarium Clean 
In the long run
If you maintain a freshwater aquarium, you’re
encouraged to break down your aquarium com-
pletely every year, essentially starting from
scratch. This is not the case in the marine aquar-
ium. The effectiveness of a well-established bio-
logical filter will last for years.
However, if you’re using an undergravel filter, it
may become heavily clogged over a long period.
In addition, the substrate itself may begin to
break down in about two years. However, you
can slowly replace the gravel over several
months by removing a thin strip of gravel and
replacing it with new gravel. The following
week, repeat the procedure and continue to do
so until the entire substrate has been replaced
without disrupting the aquarium. Under no cir-
cumstances should you break down a healthy
aquarium and replace the gravel in one step.

What, no power?
Power failure is a pretty common emergency, but you can’t do a lot to 
prevent it. Because most power outages are temporary and last less than 
24 hours, your fish and invertebrates will be fine if you aerate the water 
while the power is down. For these situations, it’s a good idea to own a 
battery-powered air pump, which helps you maintain dissolved oxygen levels.
To keep heat in the tank, wrap a thick blanket or sleeping bag around the
tank. Don’t feed your fish while the power is down, because your filters 
aren’t working.
Unfortunately, you may live in an area that’s prone to frequent power failures,
lengthy power failures, or hurricanes, which can knock out power for days. If
this is the case, make the investment and buy a portable generator for your
aquarium. This can be an expensive option, but I look at it this way: You’ve
already invested hundreds of dollars in your aquarium and its inhabitants.
Why take the chance of losing everything in one power failure? In the long
run, you’ll save both time and money with a generator.
Oh no! A leak!
Another major emergency occurs is when your aquarium springs a leak. I
know that the likelihood of your tank leaking is pretty low, but the chance of
little Wilson hurling a baseball through it is not beyond the realm of reality.
If this happens, collect as much of the water as possible into buckets and
place your aquarium inhabitants into them. Make sure you aerate the water,
and then rush out and replace the tank as soon as possible. Transfer your fil-
tration and all other equipment, including your gravel, to the new tank. Then
add your water and fish.
If you try to repair the tank, the process may take too long. And your fish
shouldn’t live in buckets for more than 24 hours.
Too hot to handle
A malfunction of your heater can lead to aquarium overheating. Most tropical
fish and invertebrates can handle water temperatures as high as 86°F, but
they don’t necessarily like it. If the heat keeps cranking, you’re going to 
literally boil them alive.
238
Part III: Taking Proper Care of Your Aquarium 

The best way to deal with overheating is to avoid it. One way to do this is to
use two smaller, less powerful heaters instead of one large one. That way, if
the heater malfunctions, you can detect it during a daily check and before the
water temperature is driven to lethal levels.
If you do walk down your stairs one morning and find your aquarium over-
heated, immediately turn the heater down, remove 20 percent to 50 percent
of the water, and place floating ice bags in the aquarium. Save the water that
you removed in buckets and let it cool. Monitor the water temperature
closely and return the water when temperatures in the aquarium and in 
the buckets are similar.
The solution to pollution
If your aquarium is well balanced, and your filtration is working properly, it’s
unlikely that you will sustain a major pollution event. However, suppose right
after you walk out the door one morning, one of your fish dies. Suppose that
fish sits in your aquarium for a day or two because you’re traveling. See
where I am going? Ammonia will skyrocket, pH will drop, and dissolved
oxygen will plummet. Pollution city!
When you walk through that door and discover a pollution event because the
water is cloudy and not smelling very good, you need to mobilize emergency
procedures immediately. I recommend a 40 percent to 50 percent water
change. Change the carbon in your filters and conduct water tests. Conduct
another 20 percent water change if conditions don’t improve. Don’t feed your
fish until conditions have stabilized and returned to normal. After aquarium
conditions return to normal, change or rinse the filter media and replace the
filter carbon.

Care of Your Fish

In this part . . .
H
ere I go into feeding your fish and keeping them
healthy. There are few effective treatments for fish
and invertebrate diseases, so the best care is preventative
care. Finally, I discuss the basics of fish and invertebrate
observation, which is important for assessing the health
of your pets. 

Chapter 16
Feeding Your Fish
In This Chapter
 Understanding that nutrition is the key to healthy pets
 Discovering the kinds of foods available
 Knowing how to feed your fish and invertebrates
F
ish and invertebrates are alive, just as people are alive. And people need
fuel for energy and growth, and that comes in the form of food. In their
natural environment, fish and invertebrates have to find their own food. They
hunt, they scavenge, and they graze. In your aquarium, your pets are spoiled.
They don’t have to work too hard to feed. However, this puts the responsibil-
ity on you to provide them with a well-balanced diet that keeps them alive
and healthy.
One of the most enjoyable parts of owning an aquarium is feeding its occu-
pants. The tank seems to come alive at feeding time, and your children and
friends will get a big kick out of it. This chapter helps you provide your fish
and invertebrates with the right food. When considering nutrition, living
marine animals are no different from your other pets: They need a well-
balanced diet.
Giving Them Their Meat and Veggies
The raw materials needed for life and growth are called nutrients. Fish, like 
all other animals, need these nutrients for sustenance, growth, and reproduc-
tion. They can get these nutrients only from organic matter that has, at one
time or another, been alive.
Keep several considerations in mind when providing food for your fish. In
their natural habitat, fish have evolved various feeding strategies to optimize
their ability to obtain nutrients. With all the different kinds of fish and habi-
tats, you can imagine the many feeding strategies that exist.
In general, fish can be divided three general groups based on feeding 
strategy: carnivores, herbivores, and omnivores.

Meat eaters (carnivores)
Fishes and invertebrates that are predators are called carnivores. In their 
natural habitat, they feed on fishes or invertebrates that they bite, engulf, 
or crush. These are flesh-eaters. If these creatures were human, they would
prefer steak, chicken, or fish. Carnivores eat a variety of animals, ranging
from tiny plankton to large species of fish. Invertebrates, such as corals, 
that filter-feed small plankton from the water are actually carnivorous.
In the aquarium, many tropical marine fishes and invertebrates have been suc-
cessfully fed dead food, commercially prepared pellets and flakes, or live crit-
ters. Pieces of fish, shrimp, and other meats will be taken by most carnivores,
but some species will simply not accept anything but live food. Guppies, gold-
fish, and brine shrimp are commonly offered to these predators.
Grazers (herbivores)
Critters that prefer to eat vegetative matter, which is mainly algae, are called
herbivores. If these animals were people, they would be the salad-eaters.
Some tropical marine species of fish, such as tangs, are exclusively herbivo-
rous, deriving all their nutrients from plants and algae. However, from a prac-
tical standpoint, there are few strictly herbivorous fishes in captivity, and
most can be conditioned to eat other foods.
Studies have shown that all marine aquarium fishes known to feed exclusively
on plants in the wild will accept animal tissue in captivity. Regardless, it is
important to have a lush growth of algae in your aquarium if you intend to
house fish or invertebrates that are herbivorous by nature. You can also aug-
ment their diet with household vegetables, like blanched lettuce and spinach.
Meat and potatoes (omnivores)
If a species of fish is not selective relative to whether it eats meat or vegeta-
bles, it is called omnivorous. These fish and invertebrates feed on a variety of
foods and have no specific dietary preferences. (Most humans are omnivo-
rous by nature, mixing meats, fruits, and vegetables in their diet.)
Many of the recommended species outlined in Chapter 10 are considered
omnivorous. As a new hobbyist, you don’t want to worry about special 
feeding strategies when setting up an aquarium for the first time. These fish
accept commercially prepared flake and pellet foods, but providing a good
variety of foods is necessary to meet all their dietary requirements. Many
invertebrate species are omnivorous as well, scavenging organic matter and
algae from the substrate.
244
Part IV: Taking Proper Care of Your Fish 

Before you buy a fish or invertebrate, find out its feeding preferences.
Knowing the Building Blocks 
of Fish Nutrition
Like all living animals, fish have dietary requirements for proteins, fats, 
carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. In their natural environment, fish
meet their own needs by foraging and hunting. In the aquarium, fish rely
entirely on you to meet their dietary needs.
Unfortunately, the nutritional needs of tropical marine organisms are poorly
understood. These requirements can differ by species, age, water tempera-
ture, and many other factors. The best that any aquarist, including the pro-
fessionals, can do is to feed the fish a variety of foods and thereby
approximate their requirements.
By consuming different types of food, the fish is more likely to obtain all its
nutritional requirements.
 Proteins: Proteins are major constituents of all animal tissue, and they
are essential in the diet to maintain normal growth. Younger fish in par-
ticular require more protein in their diets than do larger, older fish.
 Lipids (fats): Lipids, commonly called fats, are critical components of
cell membranes. They also provide an immediate supply of chemical
energy and stored energy. We all probably have a little too much stored
energy, if you know what I mean.
 Carbohydrates: Carbohydrates are broken down into units of glucose,
which is a major source of energy. They can also be converted to lipids
for energy storage.
 Vitamins and minerals: These important compounds play the same
important roles in fish as they do in mammals. They provide the neces-
sary ingredients for proper metabolism and skeletal stability.
Identifying the Types of Food
You can find many different types of food for your tropical marine fish.
Carnivores eat flake food, brine shrimp, and almost any kind of seafood —
crab, lobster, oysters, and clams. Herbivores adapt to an omnivorous diet,
taking flake and frozen foods and vegetables while grazing on aquarium algae.
Omnivores eat all these foods.
245
Chapter 16: Feeding Your Fish

Aquarium foods can be grouped into a variety of categories, and experts do 
it differently. I prefer to classify aquarium foods into three general categories:
natural foods, prepared foods, and live foods.
Natural foods
This group of foods includes items that are obtained fresh, frozen, or freeze-
dried. They are not heavily processed. They can be fed to the fish fresh,
cooked, or dried. Foods under this category are leafy-green vegetables, fish
and invertebrate flesh, and frozen or freeze-dried invertebrates.
Leafy greens
It is essential to provide vegetative matter in the diet, because some of the
marine species are naturally herbivorous. Although the algae in your aquar-
ium may be enough for some grazing fishes and invertebrates, you should
also feed vegetables that are fresh, blanched, or thawed after freezing.
Common vegetables include lettuce, spinach, cabbage, parsley, kale, and
watercress, to name a few.
Some aquarists prefer to blanch the vegetables to aid in their digestion. This
means that vegetables are boiled for just a few minutes to soften them up and
break down cell membranes.
In general, vegetables are composed mostly of water and are low in energy,
protein, and lipid but contain high concentrations of carbohydrate, fiber, and
certain vitamins. You don’t want to feed only vegetables to your fish, but be
prepared to provide them to your herbivorous fish.
Meaty foods of the sea
If you live in the sea, it only makes sense that you eat seafood, which
includes a variety of foods comprising fish and invertebrate meats. They 
are fed fresh, thawed, or cooked. Cooking these foods doesn’t lower their
nutritional value. Cooking is also a good idea because raw seafood can carry
infectious diseases that can be transmitted to the aquarium fish. Cooking can
involve boiling, steaming, or using foods that are canned in water, which are
already boiled.
Only feed your marine animals flesh from other sea animals, because you want
to serve them foods that have a similar composition to themselves. In other
words, don’t scrape your Thanksgiving turkey leftovers into the aquarium. 
246
Part IV: Taking Proper Care of Your Fish 

The variety of meats available is vast. This category includes fishes like 
herring, anchovy, smelt, mackerel, and tuna, as well as shellfish like clams,
shrimp, mussels, scallops, oysters, crabs, and squid. In general, meaty foods
contain less water and carbohydrate and substantially more protein and lipid
than vegetative matter.
You must include meaty food for carnivorous fishes.
Frozen and dried
These foods often provide the greatest portion of your fish’s diet, because
many are specifically produced for aquarium use and are widely available.
The dietary value of this food is similar to that of meaty foods. Some of the
most common commercially available frozen foods in this category include
brine shrimp, plankton, krill, and other shrimps. Also, many of the seafoods
such as fish, squid, scallops, shrimp, and clams are offered frozen.
Frozen foods are generally packaged in such a way that you can break off a
chunk and put it in the aquarium. I prefer to thaw the food first in a small cup
of water from the tank and then pour the mixture into the aquarium.
Most commercial processors treat frozen foods with gamma rays to ensure
that they are free of disease.
Freeze-drying has made it possible to preserve a variety of natural foods for
aquarium fish. For the marine aquarium, the process has most often been
applied to brine shrimp and other small invertebrates such as krill, tubifex
worms, and bloodworms. These critters are not processed, and what you see
is what you get, the whole animal without water.
Dried and frozen foods help increase the variety of the foods that you’re feed-
ing your fish, but they shouldn’t be the only food offered to them. Although it
has been shown that freeze-dried brine shrimp have the same lipid concen-
trations as freshly killed brine shrimp, it has not been proven that they are a
complete dietary substitute for live brine shrimp.
Prepared foods
This category of food not only contains the flake and dry foods that are com-
mercially processed for aquarium fish, but also includes frozen processed
foods that contain a number of healthy ingredients. Prepared foods try to
approximate the basic requirements of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.
They are also supplemented with vitamins and minerals.
247
Chapter 16: Feeding Your Fish

These foods come in many varieties, depending on the type of fish (carni-
vore, herbivore, or omnivore), and new formulations are being added every
year to better estimate the dietary needs of your pets. Marine algae that are
dried in sheets are becoming a popular dried food for marine fishes.
Don’t feed foods that are processed for freshwater fish to saltwater fish.
Prepared foods came in many forms, depending on the size and the feeding
behavior of the fish. Flakes, tablets, pellets, and crumb forms are available.
For example, larger predatory fishes should be fed pellets as opposed to
flakes, because they prefer to consume a large quantity. In addition, fish that
feed on the bottom may not venture to the surface for flakes, so they must be
fed pellets or tablets that sink to the bottom. You can also stick pellets to the
aquarium glass for the grazing species in your tank.
Many of the fish reviewed in this book can be fed prepared foods. However, if
you want active, colorful, and healthy fish, you must vary their diet. Flake is
good as a staple food, but you need to make every effort to substitute other
foods (every day) that enrich your fish.
Live foods
Live food is an excellent source of nutrition for the tropical marine aquarium.
Fishes and invertebrates that are fed live foods ordinarily grow fast, have
vibrant colors, and maintain high survival rates. This is because live foods
retain active enzymes that make digestion more efficient. Also, because few
fish species refuse live foods, offering live foods is the best way to get the
picky eaters to eat.
Live foods are an essential requirement of captive fishes, and they must be
included as a dietary supplement. The type of live food you give your pets
depends on the size of the fish or invertebrate you’re feeding.
Brine shrimp
The most popular live food for tropical marine fish is brine shrimp (Artemia
species), a primitive crustacean inhabiting shallow salt ponds in over 160
locations around the world. Those in your local pet store probably originated
in San Francisco Bay or Great Salt Bay in Utah. They are one of the best
sources of nutrition available for marine aquarium organisms of any type.
Tiny hatchlings, called nauplii, are ideal for filter-feeding organisms, as well.
Brine shrimp are an excellent source of lipids and protein. Of all the live food
available, they are the safest because they don’t carry disease. An added
248
Part IV: Taking Proper Care of Your Fish 

advantage to brine shrimp is that you can raise them yourself, because many
dealers sell brine shrimp eggs.
To raise brine shrimp, follow the instructions accompanying the eggs.
However, I have found that the following simple steps work well:
1. In a plastic or glass container, make a solution of seawater with a 
standard specific gravity of 1.021-1.024.
2. Bring the water temperature of the hatch solution up to about 75°
to 80°F.
Use an immersion heater if you must.
3. Place an aerator in the solution and adjust the air to produce a slow
stream of bubbles.
Too much air causes the eggs to collect along the edges of the container.
4. Add the brine shrimp eggs, called cysts, at a concentration of about
one teaspoon of eggs per gallon of hatch solution.
Handle them with care, because they are small and delicate.
5. After ten minutes, illuminate the container with a 40-watt light about
eight inches from the container for about ten minutes. This will initi-
ate hatching.
6. After 24 hours, shut off the aerator and allow the empty shells and
unhatched eggs to separate from the nauplii (hatchlings).
7. After 15 minutes, attract the nauplii to a corner of the container using
a small flashlight. The young brine shrimp are attracted to light. This
will take about 15 minutes, depending on how far they have to swim.
8. When they are concentrated, drain or siphon them into a fine mesh
net and rinse them well with artificial seawater.
You can find containers at your dealer that fit in your aquarium for hatching
brine shrimp eggs, as well.
Brine shrimp can be fed to your fish or placed in a container of seawater for
growing to larger sizes. If you choose to keep the young shrimp, bring the
water temperature to about 86°F and provide low aeration. The nauplii can
be fed brewer’s yeast or powdered rice bran dissolved in water for several
days. Aquarists who want to raise the brine shrimp for longer periods should
try to obtain one of the encapsulated feeds devised for crustacean larvae
that are available commercially.
249
Chapter 16: Feeding Your Fish

Other live foods
Other common live foods that may be available at your dealer include the 
following:
 Feeder fish: Small freshwater fishes, including guppies and goldfish, are
popular food items for larger predatory fish such as lionfish. Although
guppies can tolerate salt water, goldfish can’t, so make sure that they 
are either eaten or removed before they die.
 Earthworms: These backyard dirt dwellers offer an economical food
source for many aquarium fishes. They can be served whole or in
pieces, depending on the size of your fish, but be sure to thoroughly
rinse them first.
 Blackworms and tubifex worms: Many dealers carry these freshwater
worms that are readily consumed by aquarium fishes. Although they are
only worms, be aware that they will not live long in salt water, so feed
them sparingly.
 Rotifers: These tiny, planktonic animals are ideal for filter-feeding 
invertebrates, but they may be difficult to obtain.
 Glass shrimp: Although these little decapods aren’t easy to find, they
make excellent live food for both fish and invertebrates in your aquarium.
Their name comes from the fact that you can see right though them.
Putting Food in Their Mouths
The biggest questions when it comes to feeding your critters are how much
and how often to feed them. Some fish are gluttons, whereas others stop
when they’re full. We all know people from both ends of this spectrum.
It is important that the same person or people feed the aquarium. This
ensures that the feeding is done consistently and with an eye for the right
quantities. Letting Uncle Bill feed the fish when he visits may result in a lot of
waste and water pollution. Also, keep a tight lid on the tank during a party.
Inevitably, everybody wants to feed the fish.
It is definitely better to feed them too little than too much. Use the following
guidelines (and see Figure 16-1) when feeding and you will develop a working
sense of how much and how often to feed them.
250
Part IV: Taking Proper Care of Your Fish 

 Offer as much food as your fish will eat in five minutes. Flakes should
sink no deeper than one-third the height of the tank. Provide tablets, 
pellets, or sinking food for bottom fish and invertebrates.
 Feed your fish in very small portions over the five-minute period. If
any food is left over after this time, you’re an overfeeder. Bear in mind,
however, that some foods, such lettuce or spinach, are nibbled over
time, so the five-minute rule does not apply to leafy vegetables. Some
foods can be clipped to the side of the tank (Figure 16-1).
 If you’re home during the daytime, feed your fish and invertebrates
very small portions over the course of the day. In this case, reduce
feeding time to about a minute or two per session. If you’re not home,
feed them twice a day at the same times every day: once in the morning,
once in the evening.
 Always feed your fish at the same spot in the tank. This lets you sneak
food down to bottom dwellers while the surface fish are distracted.
 Rehydrate or thaw food beforehand. Use a separate container, such as
a glass (Figure 16-2).
 Don’t overfeed the fish, no matter how much you think they need
more food. Overeating stresses your fish and causes detritus to 
accumulate in the tank, degrading water quality.

“Nibblers”

251
Chapter 16: Feeding Your Fish

Dealing with the oddballs
Although the following steps get you going, you’ll find a lot of exceptions. 
For example, some invertebrates, such as sea anemones and corals, house
photosynthetic bacteria that provide them with nutrients, so you don’t need
to feed them every day. Their diet, however, should be augmented once or
twice a week with fresh, frozen, or live foods.
Also, large carnivorous fish typically consume one large meal at a time, so
you don’t need to feed them more than once every day or two.
It is better to underfeed than to overfeed your fishes and invertebrates.
Keeping a watchful eye
Watch all your fishes during feeding. This is a good time to assess your
fishes’ health and take a head count, as well. Try to make sure that each gets
its share of food, but this will not always be possible. In the ocean world, it’s
eat or go hungry, so don’t expect a lot of good will.
Figure 16-2:
Thaw out
frozen food
before
adding it to
your tank.
252
Part IV: Taking Proper Care of Your Fish 

Remember that fish have different mouth shapes which allow them to feed 
at different levels in the tank. Some species don’t move to the surface to eat;
they wait for food to disperse throughout the tank. Don’t rely on surface feed-
ings and the leftovers of others to feed bottom fish. Pellets or other foods
that sink to the bottom should be provided to these fish. You may have to
offer food through a turkey baster or distribute food via a feeding stick.
Refusal to eat is one of the first signs of illness, so keep an eye out for fish
that seem to have no interest in food.
Always remove food from the tank that hasn’t been consumed. Allow nibblers
time to eat — an hour or two — before removing leftovers.
Offering a variety
Freshwater fish and saltwater fish aren’t the same — you know that. If you’ve
ever had a freshwater aquarium, dry flake food was all you sprinkled in your
tank every day. You need to break that habit. Although you may offer a daily
staple, marine organisms must be fed a variety of foods.
You can try flake food and frozen brine shrimp as your staples, but mix in 
different foods as your fish acclimate to your aquarium. Try not to feed your
fish right after turning on the light, because they will not be fully alert until
about 30 minutes later. In addition, make sure you match the size of the food
with the size of the fishes’ mouths. You may need to crush or mulch the food
for fish with small mouths. But be sure not to grind the food too small. This
adds to the water fine particles that are not ingested and that degrade water
quality.
Going away?
If you’re going to be away from your aquarium for one or two days, the fish
will be fine without food. When you return, don’t feel that you have to feed
your fish twice as much because they missed a meal. If you do, much will go
uneaten.
If you plan to travel for longer periods, you have a couple of options. You can
arrange for someone to feed your fish. Prepare portions ahead of time and
give detailed instructions on how to properly feed your animals. Don’t let
them do so at their own discretion unless they are experienced aquarists.
253
Chapter 16: Feeding Your Fish

The other option is the purchase of an automatic feeder. This specialized piece
of equipment dispenses dry food for you while you’re away. You wouldn’t want
to load it with fresh seafood, but many processed foods work well.
Feeding Your Invertebrates
While discussing feeding in this chapter, I’ve made every effort to reference
invertebrates as well as fishes. Nonetheless, I think it’s important to make 
a few extra points about feeding invertebrates because they are such a
diverse group.
The key to invertebrate feeding is to do so sparingly. They don’t need as
much food as their fishy counterparts.
In general, invertebrates can be divided into three kinds of feeders: carnivo-
rous predators and scavengers, herbivorous grazers, and filter feeders.
Hunting and gathering (carnivorous)
Many invertebrate species, such as lobsters, squids, conchs, and large 
crabs, are predators or scavengers of meat. If you choose to keep any of
these critters, you can provide them with many meaty live foods, like 
goldfish and guppies, as well as seafoods, including clams, mussels, and
shrimps. Feed these invertebrates once a day — quantities depend on the
size of the animal. Be sure to remove uneaten food after about an hour,
because these invertebrates tend to eat slowly.
Scraping (herbivorous)
Herbivorous invertebrates, like small snails and crabs, prefer to graze algae
from the walls, gravel, and decorations in the aquarium. They can typically
subsist on this while scavenging minute organic matter, as well.
Sifting (filter feeders)
Strict filter feeders, like featherduster worms and soft corals, are generally
not recommended for the aquarium of a beginner. However, if you simply
can’t resist the beauty of these critters in your reef tank, you have to feed
254
Part IV: Taking Proper Care of Your Fish 

them liquidized seafoods, newly hatched brine shrimp nauplii, live rotifers,
or commercial liquid feeds. Feed filter feeders once per day: The general
quantity is about one drop of liquid food per animal. Note, though, that the
food requirements of suspension feeding creatures are quite specific, so
make sure you’re providing the right food for the species you’re keeping.
Several species of filter feeders, such as anemones and hard corals, contain
photosynthetic algae that provide them with a lot of their nutritional needs.
However, don’t assume that all their nutritional requirements are met by
these algae. In nature, these animals still filter feed, so they must be fed in
captivity, as well. Any of the filter-feeder foods listed in this section will work.
Anemones can be fed small bits of seafood, as well, but this should be done
sparingly, only once every week or two.

f you intend to be a tropical fish hobbyist for a long time, inevitably one of
your fish will become infected with some kind of disease. Marine tropical
fishes are subject to all kind of maladies. Pathogenic organisms that cause
disease include parasites, bacteria, viruses, and fungi. They are present in 
the ocean and in the aquarium, and it is difficult to eliminate them. Many are
introduced with new fish, and many are highly contagious.
However, whether or not disease actually breaks out depends on the resis-
tance of your fish. A healthy fish has a strong resistance and an immune
system that keeps pathogens in check. A fish or invertebrate with stress is 
a fish that’s vulnerable to disease. In this chapter and Chapter 18, I discuss
stress and disease in your aquarium, what causes an animal to be become
vulnerable, and how to prevent it.
Stop the Stressin’
Everyone knows what stress is, but I’m sure that everybody’s definition is not
the same. What one person considers stressful may be a routine day at the
office for another. When I use the term stress, I’m referring to the biological
interpretation: any condition in which the normal biological functioning of 
an animal is disrupted.
In biological terms, the normal biological function of an animal is called its
homeostasis. Anything that disrupts the animal’s homeostasis is a stressor,
and the animal is said to be stressed.
Stressors can be physical, biological, or psychological. You may be familiar
with psychological stress, but you may not think about physical stress. For

example, suppose you’re working outdoors on a brutally hot day. If you don’t
drink plenty of fluids and rest in the shade, your body temperature will rise,
and your homeostasis will be disrupted. Your body responds by sweating, and
if steps aren’t taken, heat exhaustion or stroke will result. You’re under stress.
This kind of stress can happen to any animal, including your aquarium pets.
When an animal’s homeostasis is disrupted, its immune system is often com-
promised, which means that its resistance to harmful pathogens is reduced. If
the conditions that produced the stress persist, the situation is called chronic
stress, and the animal may succumb to disease.
Poor living conditions weaken your fish, cause chronic stress, and ultimately
lower the fish’s resistance. That’s when your fish is most vulnerable to dis-
ease, and those pathogens living in your aquarium make their move.
The best way to deal with stress is to avoid it.
Stressful Conditions
In the closed system of an aquarium, fish and invertebrates are exposed 
to stressors that their wild counterparts may be able to avoid. Your pets
depend on you to make sure stressful conditions are avoided.
I summarize stressful conditions in Table 17-1. In this table you also find the
corresponding chapter numbers in this book that you can go to for solutions
to these problems. After the table, I discuss each stressor individually.

Part IV: Taking Proper Care of Your Fish 

Poor water quality
First and foremost on the list of stressors is poor water quality. The water 
in your aquarium is the medium that your pets depend on to live. Fish and
invertebrates can live for days without food, but without clean water, they
die immediately. Not only is water to them what air is to us, but they also 
literally need water like we need water because they drink it, as well.
Fish excrete wastes into the very water that they use to stay alive. In the
open ocean, this is not a problem, but in the closed system of an aquarium, 
it can be dangerous. That is why I place a huge amount of emphasis on filtra-
tion in Chapter 7 and maintenance in Chapter 15. Clean water means healthy
water, which means healthy fish and invertebrates.
When the water is polluted with wastes, the pH drops, ammonia and other
nitrogenous compounds increase, the buffering capacity diminishes rapidly,
carbon dioxide builds, and dissolved oxygen plummets. When these condi-
tions develop, the water then acts as a stressor, and your marine animals
become stressed.
Under the stressful conditions associated with poor water quality, fish and
invertebrates have to work harder to breathe, their heart rates increase,
internal ion balance is disrupted, and internal pH drops. In addition, their
bodies react by producing a number of hormones that compromise the
immune system. If the level of pollution is extreme, the inability of the fish 
to offload carbon dioxide in exchange for oxygen will kill it immediately. The
animal will literally drown, which is something we generally don’t think of
when it comes to organisms that live in the ocean.
However, if water quality degrades slowly, the stress becomes chronic, and
the animal becomes increasingly susceptible to the harmful pathogens that
live around and inside its body. The fish will become sick and may die.
To avoid poor water quality, make sure you have adequate filtration for the
size of your aquarium, don’t overcrowd your aquarium, and properly main-
tain your aquarium and its filtration. Use water parameter tests to look for
and diagnose signs of water degradation.
Handling
Every time you chase your fish with a net, catch them, spook them, bag them,
move them, or remove them from the water, you’re stressing your pets — you
are the stressor. This kind of stress is typically known as capture stress or 
handling stress.
259
Chapter 17: Preventing Stress 

Long-term stress is called chronic, and this kind of short-term stress is called
acute. Acute stress can be as lethal as chronic stress.
The physical consequences of acute stress can lead to death from respira-
tory failure, infections from physical damage, and immune-system failure 
and disease. Fish and many invertebrates have a protective mucous layer
that acts as a first line of defense against infection and disease. When this
layer is removed or damaged, one of their defenses is compromised, and an
avenue for pathogens is opened.
Unfortunately, handling stress can’t be avoided. In fact, when you buy your
fish, they have already been subjected to a lot of handling stress from cap-
ture in the wild, transport to your dealer, removal from his tank, and trans-
port to your home. There is no way around it. The only way to deal with
handling stress is to minimize it, keeping the following principles in mind:
 Make sure you buy fish and invertebrates that have had a chance to
recover from the handling stress associated with capture and trans-
port to your dealer. They should have been in your dealer’s possession
for a least a week. Feeding is a good sign that they have recovered.
 Minimize handling stress by reducing the amount of chase time and
net time when you’re moving a fish. I know this is easier said than
done, but don’t chase a fish around the aquarium in an effort to tire 
it out. This will exhaust the fish, and the consequences may be lethal.
Instead, try to coax the fish with food to an area when it can be snatched
with the net or cornered quickly. After the fish is in the net, move it to
the container or bag as quickly as possible, keeping it out of the water
for only seconds. Keep the travel container as close as possible.
 Keep travel time short. The more time in the container or bag, the more
stress. Keep in mind that water quality in the container degrades quickly.
 Use a net that’s not only soft on the fish but also large enough to 
accommodate the whole fish. This will minimize damage to the protective
mucous layer on their skin. If an animal doesn’t fit into the net properly, 
it may flip out during transfer, and physical damage will surely occur.
Injury
Anything that causes injury to your fish and invertebrates applies physical
stress that can lead to immediate death or delayed mortality due to infection
or disease. An injured fish, like any injured animal, bleeds when its tissues
are damaged. Veins and arteries carrying blood throughout the body of the
fish can be damaged when the fish is bitten, dropped, or physically abused in
some way. The bleeding may be external or internal depending on the nature
and the extent of the damage.
260
Part IV: Taking Proper Care of Your Fish 

If a physical injury doesn’t cause immediate death from blood loss, at the
very least it will compromise the protective mucous layer of the skin, which
can lead to infection. In addition, an injured fish is not a healthy fish. It may
stop feeding, and its immune system may become compromised, leading to
more serious ailments.
Whereas handling stress can obviously cause physical damage, there 
are a number of injurious aquarium conditions to watch out for, as well.
Overcrowding, incompatibility, territoriality, and certain social behaviors 
can also cause injuries to a fish or invertebrate.
Lack of nutrition
If an animal isn’t eating right, it won’t be healthy and strong. An unhealthy
fish will be stressed. It won’t be able to power its immune system, and the
door to disease will be wide open.
Your fish or invertebrate may not be eating right for a couple of reasons.
First, you may not be feeding it the right kinds of food or meeting its nutri-
tional needs. Read Chapter 16. Make every effort to offer the right foods in
terms of content, size, and placement.
Another cause of poor nutrition can be associated with the inability of the
fish or invertebrate to physically get to the food. Perhaps aggressive tank
mates eat everything, or maybe the fish prefers to feed low in the tank and
food is not getting to it. You may have to take extra steps to feed those fish 
or invertebrates that are having this problem.
Don’t forget that invertebrates with photosynthetic algae, such as corals and
anemones, need adequate amounts of light to feed. Poor lighting stresses
these animals.
Overcrowding
Having too many occupants in your aquarium can have several stressful
effects. The immediate physical effect of overcrowding is associated with 
lack of personal space. Not having enough room leads to territorial disputes,
fighting, and injuries. Injuries lead to infection, disease, and death.
Overcrowded conditions inevitably lead to poor water quality. Too many 
animals leads to too much waste, which leads to pollution. Pollution, of
course, leads to stress, and so on.
261
Chapter 17: Preventing Stress 

Aggressive behavior
In Chapter 3, I chew up a little space discussing fish compatibility. Some
species of animals simply don’t get along with their own kind, let alone with
other species. When placed in the same tank, these fish can get aggressive.
Aggressive behavior can be exhibited because of territoriality, competition
for food, or sexual behavior. It usually results in fighting and injury. Injury, 
of course, can cause immediate death or lead to secondary infection and 
disease. Moreover, a fish that’s constantly harassed by another fish is prone
to jumping from the aquarium, has a general lack of appetite, and lives under
chronic stress.
When choosing fish and invertebrates for your aquarium, make sure to
choose animals that get along. A single bad seed can cause severe problems
for your aquarium and may ultimately live alone.
Temperature changes
If your heater malfunctions, you have a serious problem. If it fails to work, the
temperature of the aquarium plummets, and your fish will stress. If it fails to
turn off, the temperature soars, and your fish will stress. If temperature rises
or falls to levels outside the thermal tolerance of your pets, the acute stress
will kill them immediately. If not, the acute stress may cause secondary physi-
cal effects associated with temperature fluctuations that weaken the animal,
compromise the immune system, and lead to disease.
However, water temperature doesn’t have to rise or fall to levels that the crit-
ters can’t tolerate in order for them to be stressed. The rate of temperature
change can be just as detrimental. If your aquarium temperature rises or falls
rapidly but stays within the tolerance of your pets, the sudden change can
still kill or cause problems. The same thing happens if you move your animal
from the transport bag to an aquarium full of much cooler or warmer water.
Extreme temperature changes can be avoided if you frequently check your
heater and water temperature. Also make sure that water temperatures are
the same between two containers when fish and invertebrates are being
transferred.
Salinity changes
In Chapters 9 and 13, I discuss the level of salt in your aquarium, which is
measured as salinity or specific gravity. While you must maintain salt levels
within a specific range, you must also avoid sudden changes within that
range. Any changes in salinity stress your aquarium pets.
262
Part IV: Taking Proper Care of Your Fish 

Stress from changes in salinity is called osmotic stress because it disrupts
osmotic balance. Osmotic stress disrupts the animal’s normal function
because it creates an osmotic imbalance that needs to be corrected, and this
requires energy. Ultimately, other bodily functions, like the immune system,
may fail as energy is redirected to corrective osmoregulation, and disease
may result. You can review osmoregulation in Chapter 2.
Sudden dramatic changes in salt levels cause acute osmotic stress that can be
lethal if salinity rises or falls outside the osmotic range of the animal. More
gradual changes in salinity may not be lethal, but can still cause chronic stress.
Avoid sudden and dramatic changes in salinity by closely monitoring salt
levels in your aquarium and conducting regular water-level maintenance (top
off the tank — see Chapter 15).
Disturbances
Any sudden change in light or sound can stress your fish. This includes that
annoying habit some people have of tapping on the glass of your aquarium,
thinking that they are going to attract the fish. These disturbances cause
acute stress that may not be detrimental if they occur only once in a while,
but can be a problem if they’re repeated often.
Try to avoid switching the light on while the fish are resting during late-night
hours. Avoid sudden changes in noise level and keep people from tapping on
the glass.
Recognizing Stress
The first step to dealing with stress and disease in your aquarium is to recog-
nize and identify the problem. You should be able to determine whether an
animal is healthy by checking its appearance and its behavior. This isn’t com-
plicated and doesn’t take long. Because you’re feeding your aquarium inhabi-
tants every day, feeding times are the best times to give them an examination.
With any kind of stress symptoms, determine whether the problem is affect-
ing only one critter or the whole aquarium. If more than one fish is displaying
symptoms of stress, your problem may be systemic. Conduct water tests,
check your notes, and run down the list of stressful conditions listed earlier
in this chapter to isolate the cause. If only one fish is affected, you probably
need to isolate it for treatment and to keep any malady from spreading.
263
Chapter 17: Preventing Stress 

So, what exactly are you looking for? Chapter 5 shares telltale signs of
unhealthy fish that you want to look for when you purchased them. Those
same signs manifest themselves in your aquarium if your fish or inverte-
brates are stressed or suffering from some ailment.
Acting weird
How an animal acts betrays the way that it feels. Fish and invertebrates
simply don’t fake their behavior. If they don’t feel right, you know it fairly
quickly. The following sections discuss a couple of behavioral signs.
Not being hungry
One of the first signs of stress or illness is the loss of appetite. Think about it.
How hungry are you when you’re sick? The fact that the animal was eating
but suddenly has no interest tells you that something is wrong. If you suspect
that one of your pets isn’t interested in food, try offering something that it
normally can’t refuse, like live food.
Laziness
Another symptom of stress is a general laziness. If one of your pets loses its
pep and becomes more sedentary, something is wrong. If it feeds only half-
heartedly or avoids other fish, it is clearly fighting some kind of ailment.
Other symptoms include hiding and keeping to itself. Lethargic fish typically
keep their fins folded close to their body.
Keep in mind that everything is relative when diagnosing your fish. It’s the
change in behavior that counts. Some species are naturally lethargic or prefer
the safety of hiding places. This doesn’t mean they are sick.
Gasping
If your fish is spending an inordinate amount of time hyperventilating or gasp-
ing at the surface, you have a clear sign of stress. This is not necessarily a sign
of disease, but is probably indicative of poor water quality and low dissolved
oxygen. By the way, your fish isn’t breathing oxygen from the air at the surface
but trying to pull oxygen from the richer surface layers. Fish with gill parasites
have increased respiration as well and appear to cough; they may position
themselves in front of powerheads or areas of high water motion.
Rubbing
Any fish that displays rubbing or twitching behavior is stressed by some kind
of problem. It’s not unusual for an animal that’s infested with parasites to rub
itself against the gravel and aquarium decorations.
264
Part IV: Taking Proper Care of Your Fish 

Looking weird
By far, the best way to determine whether your fish and invertebrates aren’t
well is to check their physical appearance. Anything out of the ordinary
should be considered a sign of stress or disease, and you must take appropri-
ate steps. Many of these signs apply to fish and invertebrates alike. Physical
characteristics that are indicative of stress or disease include the following:
 Discoloration: Faded colors and discoloration are classic signs of 
stress. Strange white spots or blotches may be infectious pathogens 
or parasites. Cuts and scrapes in the skin are signs of injury.
 Clouded eyes: Glazed or cloudy eyes are indicative of stress and dis-
ease. The eyes of fish and invertebrates (if they have any) are normally
clear and alert.
 Frayed fins: Fins that are shredded or frayed are indicative of fighting or
disease. Also, fins that are kept folded or close to the body for extended
periods may betray a problem.
 Abnormal stomach: When your fish has a pinched stomach, it usually
means that the fish is not feeding. When the stomach is distended
(pooched out), the fish is probably feeding too much.
Making a Diagnosis
Suppose one of your fish or invertebrates is showing one of the signs that I
outlined in the preceding section. Now what? At this point, you suspect that
your pet is suffering from stress and may very well have a disease. You need
to conduct more investigative work to determine the cause of the problem.
Find out whether the symptom is being exhibited by just one fish or involves
more than one critter. If more than one is showing symptoms, your problem
may be systemic — the problem has spread throughout the aquarium. In
these situations, consider the list of stressful conditions that pertain to the
whole system, such as water quality, and evaluate each one.
If, however, only one animal is showing signs of stress, check for the stressful
conditions that may be specific to a single animal, such as injury or lack of
nutrition.
After you isolate a stressful condition, make every effort to stop it. Use Table
17-1 (earlier in this chapter), which gives you the chapter numbers in this
book in which you can find solutions to your problem. If poor water quality is
a problem, read Part III. If your fish have nutritional problems, read Chapter
16. Whatever the problem, make sure the stressor doesn’t persist.
265
Chapter 17: Preventing Stress 

It is one thing to treat the symptom, it’s another to stop the cause. You need
to stop the cause. However, in some cases, it is simply not possible to isolate
and stop the stressor. At times, everything checks out and you can’t find a
stressful condition. All you can do at this point is treat the ailment (see
Chapter 18).
266
Part IV: Taking Proper Care of Your Fish 
Disease and stress
Some of the symptoms of stress may disappear
when you isolate the stressful condition and
stop it. For example, a gasping fish may stop
gasping when you increase aeration and
improve water quality.
In some cases, though, the stressor takes its
toll, the fish’s resilience is diminished, and the
fish contracts a disease. Right from the begin-
ning of your diagnosis, the tell-tale symptoms of
some ailments tell you that there is a problem.
If this is the case, you have to treat the animal
and, if the problem is systemic, you have to treat
the entire aquarium. This is the subject of
Chapter 18.

Diseases and Treatments
In This Chapter
 Treating your fish when they’re ailing
 Knowing what to do with sick fish
 Understanding common aquarium diseases
I
n Chapter 17, I tell you that the most effective way to deal with disease is
to prevent it by minimizing stress. Unfortunately, even the most effective
stress management can’t keep disease from striking one or more of your
marine pets.
Nasty pathogens that cause disease are in and around your fish in their nat-
ural setting and in your aquarium. These pathogens may be bacterial, viral,
fungal, or parasitic. Fortunately, many of the diseases caused by these agents
manifest themselves with identifiable symptoms. Unfortunately, not many
treatments are available for the home aquarist, and you have no guarantee
that your pet will be saved.
This chapter helps you recognize and treat those diseases that are most
common in the home aquarium.
Reviewing the Treatment Methods
The best remedy for disease in the marine aquarium is prevention.
Nonetheless, if disease does strike one of your animals, you have a few meth-
ods for treating it. These include direct aquarium treatment with therapeutic
agents, the hospital tank, the dip method, and internal medication, all of
which are discussed in the following sections.

Always use commercially available treatments instead of homemade reme-
dies. Some experts recommend chemicals, like malachite green or potassium
permanganate. These chemicals must be handled in exact dosages, which
can be tough for you to do. If a fish is overdosed with one of them, it will kill
the fish faster than the disease would have. Discuss all the possible remedies
with your local dealer and let that person advise you on the best commercial
remedies. When you apply the remedy, follow the directions exactly.
Don’t be afraid to call your veterinarian and ask a few questions. If your vet-
erinarian doesn’t handle fish, he or she can usually recommend somebody
who does.
Remove activated carbon from your filters when you medicate your 
aquarium. Carbon neutralizes many medications.
Direct aquarium treatment
Direct aquarium treatment involves the application of therapeutic agents
directly into the aquarium containing the diseased fish. This method is some-
times called the long bath. It can be effective against some diseases, but not
always. In some cases, medications may be absorbed by the aquarium deco-
rations or filter media, or they may be toxic to filter bacteria. Moreover, fish
medications are toxic to invertebrates. You’re better off isolating the infected
fish in a hospital tank.
The hospital tank
In Chapters 5 and 9, I mention that some aquarists isolate new fish in a 
quarantine tank. This small aquarium is also called an isolation tank. In this
simple setup, the fish or invertebrate can be evaluated for signs of disease
before it’s introduced into the main aquarium.
You may choose not to set up a quarantine tank to isolate new fish, but I do
recommend that you set up a hospital tank to isolate individuals that are suf-
fering from disease. A hospital tank reduces the likelihood of the disease
spreading to others in the aquarium. It also provides refuge for a fish that
may ordinarily be harassed by healthy fish. The hospital tank helps you to
treat the fish without subjecting other fish to the treatment. And it helps you
observe and diagnose the ailing fish.
As your expertise in this hobby increases, you will accumulate expensive fish
that you simply don’t want to expose to disease. At that point, a hospital tank
will be mandatory. It will also act as a quarantine tank as long as it has not
recently housed a diseased fish.
268
Part IV: Taking Proper Care of Your Fish 

The hospital tank need not be large: A ten-gallon tank will do. It does need
adequate filtration and aeration, but elaborate decorations and gravel should
be left out. Try to provide some kind of cover for the fish, in the form of rocks
or flowerpots, as a source of security. An external power filter, sponge filter,
or internal box filter is sufficient for the hospital tank.
The dip method
The dip method involves removing the infected fish from the aquarium and
dipping it into a bath containing a therapeutic agent or fresh water. The dip 
is brief enough not to injure the fish, but long enough to kill the pathogen.
Unfortunately, this method doesn’t treat the main aquarium, just the fish.
The freshwater dip has become as useful to the marine aquarist as the saltwa-
ter dip is to the freshwater aquarist. This method involves dipping a saltwater
fish infested with parasites into a freshwater bath for three to five minutes.
The difference in salt concentration between the aquarium and the treatment
bath is enough to rapidly kill the pathogen without harming the fish.
The bath is prepared as follows:
1. Fill a 1- to 2-gallon container full of conditioned fresh water, matching
the temperature and pH of the main aquarium.
The pH can be elevated by adding sodium bicarbonate to the container.
2. Add a quart of seawater to the bath to reduce the osmotic shock to 
the fish.
3. Net the fish and place it in the container for three to five minutes.
It may show signs of disorientation for a moment, but it should recover.
Internal medication 
Some remedies need to be administered internally. This is usually accom-
plished with injection or by feeding the remedy to the fish. I don’t recom-
mend injecting fish until you’re extremely experienced. Feeding the fish food
that has been medicated can be difficult, as well. In many cases, the dosage is
difficult to estimate, the fish isn’t feeding normally anyway, and you can’t
guarantee that the fish being treated is getting the proper amount of food.
This treatment method is, therefore, only marginally successful. Avoid it if
you can.
269
Chapter 18: Diseases and Treatments

Getting to Know Common Medications
The treatments available to the home aquarist — copper and antibiotics —
are somewhat limited for marine fish diseases. The fact of the matter is that
they are successful only some of the time.
Copper
Copper is a pollutant in the marine environment. It is, however, thought by
many to produce beneficial effects by killing parasites. Copper can have
adverse effects on fishes, it is not very stable in saltwater systems, and its
fate in the aquarium is not fully understood. Some experts feel that copper
should be eliminated as a treatment of aquarium fish diseases. Nonetheless,
it is still widely used in the aquarium trade. I would avoid the use of copper
unless you have absolutely no alternatives. If you do use it, isolate the fish in
a hospital aquarium (see the preceding section) for treatment.
Copper is toxic to invertebrates, so don’t administer copper in an aquarium
with any kind of invertebrate.
Antibiotics
Antibiotics are chemotherapeutic agents that seem to be the most effective 
way of treating some of the common aquarium diseases. When possible, treat
fish in a hospital tank to avoid the effects of these compounds on a mature,
established aquarium. Don’t, however, expect miracle cures from these com-
pounds, because many have not been found to be fully effective against disease.
Recognizing the Bad Guys
Hundreds of possible maladies can afflict fish. Some are specific to certain
species, and some can easily be transferred between species. The causes of
common aquarium ailments include bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites. Not
all are common in the average home aquarium.
Bacterial infections
You can find good bacteria and bad bacteria. Regardless, all bacteria are
microscopic one-celled organisms capable of rapid reproduction. There are
thousands of species of bacteria inhabiting many different habitats. Some are
beneficial to the aquarium in the nitrogen cycle, but some can cause infection.
270
Part IV: Taking Proper Care of Your Fish 

Fin rot
 Causes: Aeromonas, Pseudomonas, Vibrio bacteria
 Symptoms: This external bacterial infection causes erosion or rotting of
the fins and the fin rays. The base of the fins usually reddens, as well. In
advanced stages, the disease spreads to the skin, causing bleeding and
ulceration, and to the gills.
 Treatment: The occurrence of this disease is thought to reflect deterio-
rating water quality, and immediate steps should be taken to improve
conditions. Remove uneaten food, do a partial water change, and change
the activated carbon in your filter. The antibiotics furanace, augmentin,
and ciprofloxin may be effective.
Fish tuberculosis, wasting disease
 Causes: Mycobacterium bacteria
 Symptoms: External signs of this disease are often lacking. A fish that
seems outwardly healthy may be internally infected. Fish that are infected
may live a year or more before succumbing. Skin lesions, emaciation,
labored breathing, scale loss, frayed fins, and loss of appetite are all clini-
cal signs of this infection. Unfortunately, by the time these symptoms are
manifested, it is probably too late to save the fish.
 Treatment: These bacteria are transmitted orally through raw infected
fish flesh, detritus, and feces of infected fish. They can also infect skin
wounds and lesions. The best treatment is prevention by not feeding
raw fish and shellfish to your aquarium occupants. Antibiotics, including
kanamycin, erythromycin, and streptomycin, have shown some promise
against these bacteria if the disease is diagnosed. If the aquarium is
heavily infected with this disease, it must be sterilized and the water 
discarded.
Vibriosis, ulcer disease
 Cause: Vibrio bacteria
 Symptoms: A variety of symptoms are associated with this disease, but
they depend on the species of Vibrio and the species of fish. They can
include lethargy; darkening of color; anemia; ulcers on the skin and
lower jaw; bleeding of the gills, skin, and intestinal tract; clouded eyes;
loose scales; pale gills; and sudden death.
 Treatment: These bacteria commonly inhabit the intestinal tracts of
healthy fish. They become dangerous only when stress allows infection.
Poor water quality, crowding, excessive handling, and copper treatments
are common causes of stress in aquarium fish. Vaccination against infec-
tion is possible but not feasible for aquarium fish. Immersion treatments
with antibiotic compounds, including furanace, erythromycin, halquinol,
and nitrofurazone, have met with some success.
271
Chapter 18: Diseases and Treatments

Viral disease
Viruses, simple microscopic organisms, thrive by invading the cells of their
hosts. In most cases, there are no treatments for the few viral diseases of the
marine aquarium.
The most common viral disease is called cauliflower disease or lymphocystis:
 Causes: Cystivirus virus
 Symptoms: Fin and body lesions that are raised, whitish, warty, and
have a lumpy texture, like cauliflower. These lesions may take three 
to four weeks to reach their full size. Diseased fishes typically show 
few signs of distress and continue to feed and behave normally. The
infection is generally not fatal, but it can be transmitted to other fish 
in the tank.
 Treatment: There is no effective treatment of this viral infection other
than to isolate the fish immediately and let the fish’s natural immune
system deal with it. This may take as long as several months. Some
aquarists scrape the lesions off the animal.
Fungal disease
Fungi are plant-like organisms, some of which are parasitic on fishes.
Ichthyophonus disease, whirling disease
 Causes: Ichthyophonus fungus
 Symptoms: These fungi invade the internal organs of the fish, infecting
the kidney, heart, spleen, and liver. Clinical signs include emaciation,
spinal curvature, darkening or paling of the skin, roughening of the skin,
fin erosion, and skin ulcers. Erratic swimming behavior can be a symp-
tom of the disease, as well. Internal examination after death reveals
white nodules on the organs.
 Treatment: This parasitic organism has a complex life cycle. The 
fungal cysts are usually ingested by the fish, where they burst and 
enter the bloodstream, infecting internal organs. Typically, fish with 
this disease die up to two months after infestation. Treatment is very 
difficult due to the internal nature of this disease. The infected fish
should be immediately removed from the aquarium to prevent other
fishes from becoming infected.

Exophiala disease
 Causes: Exophiala fungus
 Symptoms: Lethargy, disorientation, and abnormal swimming are signs
of this fungal infection.
 Treatment: This is a poorly understood fungus, and no treatment 
is known. Isolate the fish to prevent other aquarium fishes from 
contracting the fungus.
Parasitic infestations
Parasites exist in a variety of forms, including tiny one-celled organisms
called protozoa, as well as larger invertebrates, like crustaceans and worms.
A parasite does not usually kill its host, but it can cause lesions that become
secondarily infected by bacteria. Parasites can be internally or externally
located on their hosts; the latter are more readily identified.
The following provides a general overview of those parasitic diseases you’re
most likely to encounter in your aquarium.
Marine velvet disease
 Causes: The dinoflagellate protozoan Amyloodinium ocellatum
 Symptoms: The gills are usually the first site of infection, spreading to
the skin, which becomes dull, patchy, and velvetlike; white spots are 
visible on sections of intact skin. As the disease progresses, the fish’s
behavior may include fasting, gasping, scratching against objects, and
sluggishness. Lesions caused by the dinoflagellate can lead to secondary
bacterial infection. This parasite is highly virulent and death can occur
in as little as 12 hours. Tangs, clownfish, and angelfish are especially 
susceptible.
 Treatment: This organism has three stages to its life cycle, and only 
one of them is parasitic. No completely effective treatment is known,
although copper-based products and some antibiotics, like malachite
green, nitrofurazone, and acriflavin, are effective. A freshwater dip 
sometimes dislodges these parasites from the host but does not kill
them. Treatments are often prolonged, and the entire tank must be
treated to fully eradicate the infestation.
273
Chapter 18: Diseases and Treatments

Marine white spot, cryptocaryoniasis, marine ich
 Causes: The ciliate protozoan Cryptocaryon irritans
 Symptoms: Early signs include fasting, cloudy eyes, troubled breathing,
excess skin mucus, and pale skin. White spots then appear on the skin,
gills, and eyes, and death follows within a few days, most likely due to
gill damage.
 Treatment: The white spot organism can be difficult to control. Like
marine velvet, the encysted stage of this parasite is resistant to most
treatments and remains in the gravel of the aquarium. The freshwater
dip may be effective in killing the parasites on the fish but does little to
treat the aquarium. Therefore, you must maintain levels of treatment in
the tank. Prolonged immersion in copper products is the most effective
treatment.
Uronema disease
 Causes: The ciliate protozoan Uronema marinum
 Symptoms: External ulcers, muscle and skin bleeding, lethargic behavior,
and sloughing of the skin are signs of this disease. Death may be rapid
due to impaired circulation in the gills.
 Treatment: Little is known of this parasite, but a freshwater bath 
followed by prolonged immersion in a formalin bath a day later 
is effective.
Tang turbellarian disease, black spot
 Causes: Paravortex flatworms
 Symptoms: Although the name implies that only tangs are infected, this
is not the case. Many species of fish can be infected by this flatworm. In
the parasitic phase, these organisms look like numerous dark spots dis-
tributed unevenly over the fins, gills, and body. Other signs include fast-
ing, listlessness, paling or whitish skin, and scratching against objects.
Secondary bacterial infections are known to occur, as well. These signs
are common to other infestations by flatworms.
 Treatment: Flatworms are a type of worm in a phylum of their own,
called Platyhelminthes. As with most parasitic infestations, crowding
allows the disease to spread to other tank mates. Immersion in freshwater,
trichlorfon, formalin, or praziquantel immersion can be effective.
274
Part IV: Taking Proper Care of Your Fish 

Trematode infestations
 Causes: Monogenetic trematode worms
 Symptoms: Many species of these worms are too small to see without a
microscope. They normally infect the gills, eyes, skin, mouth, and anal
opening. Infected fishes usually rub themselves against objects in the
aquarium, trying to dislodge these parasites. This often causes damage
that leads to secondary bacterial infections.
 Treatment: These infestations are difficult to eradicate because the life
cycles of these animals are poorly understood. Immersion in fresh water,
mebendazole, praziquantel, or trichlorfon has demonstrated effectiveness
against trematodes.
Crustacean infestations
 Causes: Copepod, isopod, and argulid crustaceans
 Symptoms: Most of these tiny, crab-like organisms are visible to the
naked eye. Copepods remain fixed in the same position, while isopods
and argulids move over the surface of the fish. These groups feed by
piercing the fish, causing tissue damage. Fishes with heavy infestations
swim erratically, rub against objects, and jump. Bacteria infect lesions.
 Treatment: Remove fish that are infested immediately. Also remove
aquarium decorations and either dry them to kill egg masses or immerse
them in 2 percent bleach solution for two hours. Treat infested fishes by
immersing them in fresh water, trichlorfon, or malathion baths.
Other health problems
Just when you thought there could be no more diseases, here are a couple
more to motivate you to keep your aquarium in optimal shape.
Head and lateral line erosion
 Causes: Poor water quality, nutrient deficiency, possibly a parasite
 Symptoms: Like the freshwater disease called hole-in-the-head, holes
develop and enlarge in the sensory pits of the head and down the lateral
line on the body. The disease progresses slowly, and the fish does not
seem to behave differently. Advanced stages can lead to secondary bac-
terial infection and death.
 Treatment: There are no specific treatments for this disease, although
some recommend the use of the freshwater antibiotic flagyl. Check your
water quality and make necessary adjustments. You should also make
sure that you’re meeting the nutritional needs of your fishes. Diversify
their diet and add vitamin supplements to their food.
275
Chapter 18: Diseases and Treatments

Poisoning
 Causes: Multiple causes, including buildup of nitrogenous compounds
(ammonia, nitrite), household chemicals (smoke, cleaners, fumes), and
tap water constituents (heavy metals, chloramine)
 Symptoms: Low levels of toxins in the aquarium stress fish, thereby 
lowering their resistance to other diseases. Higher levels cause abnor-
mal behavior, including darting movements, jumping, and gasping at 
the surface.
 Treatment: Make sure that activated carbon is used to remove toxins
and conduct a 20 to 40 percent water change. If pollutant levels are high,
move the fish to a hospital tank until the main aquarium problems are
corrected.
Why Invertebrates Don’t Get Sick
The answer to this conundrum is quite simple: Invertebrates do get sick. 
But you probably noticed that all of the diseases outlined in the preceding
section are associated with fish. The fact of the matter is, invertebrates con-
tract parasitic, fungal, bacterial, and viral diseases, but little is known about
how to diagnose and treat them. Although fish and invertebrates share
common pathogens, the extent to which the same remedies are effective 
isn’t well known. 
Until more research is conducted on invertebrate disease and home treat-
ment, the most effective tool is prevention. High water quality, adequate 
aeration, optimal lighting, and good nutrition are keys to keeping your 
invertebrates healthy.
276
Part IV: Taking Proper Care of Your Fish 
A worst-case scenario
In some instances, your fish is so ill that you
know it’s going to die. At that point, you have a
decision to make. You can either put the fish out
of its misery and euthanize it or let nature take
its course. This can be a difficult decision
because you generally have a lot of time and
money invested in a fish, and you’ve probably
become somewhat attached to your pet. I
always make this decision by deciding what’s
best for each individual fish.
If you decide to dispatch the animal, the most
humane way to do so it to sever its spinal
column and kill it immediately. This can be done
by either cutting off the fish’s head or passing a
knife through its back just behind the head.
Don’t discard a dead fish or invertebrate by flush-
ing it down the toilet. This may transmit disease
pathogens to local fishes. Instead, place the dead
animal in the trash or bury it in your backyard.

A
fter you get your aquarium up and running, it’s time to sit back and
enjoy your pets. They will interact with each other and with you. This 
is truly the most enjoyable part of aquarium keeping.
You control every aspect of your aquarium. The health of your pets is in your
hands, and you have to pay attention to them. Doing so requires patience,
time, and a little start-up money. But as a result of that investment, maintain-
ing your aquarium is fun. At times you’ll throw your hands in the air in dis-
gust, but those times will pass, and you’ll likely realize that being an aquarist
has rich rewards for you and your family. This chapter gives you some hints
on how to get the most out of your new hobby.
Seeing Is Believing: Fish Can Be Fun
In Chapter 1, I share some great reasons to have a saltwater aquarium. In 
this section, I briefly review those reasons and give you a few ideas about
enjoying your fish.
Fish watching
When you watch your aquarium and your pets, they’re better off. Get to know
all the subtleties of your fish and invertebrates and get a feel for their individ-
ual personalities. I, for example, like to name them after people I know. I have
a cantankerous hermit crab that I named after my grandfather and a very
pretty little damsel named after my niece, Anna.

Watch your fishy family members interact and have some fun with it. As 
you do this, you’ll know immediately whether something is wrong because
Maggie isn’t fighting with Vickie or Anna is hiding all the time. This kind of
game may sound goofy, but it’s fun to play, especially with your kids.
Each animal in your aquarium is your pet, and, as with any pet, watching it
daily tells you when it acts normally and when something is wrong. You can
diagnose problems as they arise and not after it’s too late.
Relaxing
Keeping an aquarium does involve a little work. But after you have a good
understanding of the basics, and if you keep up with the maintenance, you’ll
be able to relax with your aquarium.
Suppose it’s the dead of winter, you’re home from work, dinner is finished,
and you want to relax. Well, look at your choices. Sit down and watch a
bunch of mindless television shows, read a good book, or kick back in front
of the aquarium and watch as the drama unfolds. Fish and invertebrates are
entertaining creatures, and just sitting and watching them is relaxing. As far
as I’m concerned, relaxation is one of the best reasons to have an aquarium.
Studies show that spending time in front of the aquarium reduces stress.
Having fun with your family
If you have children or nephews and nieces, include them in as many aspects
of the aquarium as possible. Not only do they enjoy it, but they learn the
responsibility of taking care of pets. You can even teach them how to properly
feed the fish.
Daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance duties become easier if they are
shared by all. In addition, if everybody has a personal stake in the aquarium,
the aquarium will be better off: Family pets often get more attention than
those owned by a single person.
Showing off
Don’t forget to show your fish and invertebrates off to all your friends. The
beauty of a well-maintained aquarium is naturally impressive. Don’t be sur-
prised if your friends come over just to see your aquarium more than they
278
Part IV: Taking Proper Care of Your Fish 

come to see you. I guarantee you that anybody who enters the room where
you have your tank will be drawn to it immediately.
Remind your friends that they shouldn’t tap on the glass, feed the animals, or
add exotic drinks to the aquarium.
Experiencing marine biology in your home
I have been studying marine biology for more than 20 years, and that doesn’t
include my amateur years as a young aquarist. Believe me, those early aquar-
ium years with my brother Burt and my friends Dave, Condo, and Carlo were
extremely important in helping shape my future. If you, too, are an aspiring
marine biologist, there’s no better way to get started than to own an aquar-
ium. Because many studies on fish biology have been conducted on fish kept
in aquaria (see Chapter 1), an amateur biologist can learn a lot about fish in
his or her own home.
Keeping a Log
When I discuss water chemistry in Part III of this book, I stress the need to
write down the results of the water-quality tests. This way, you’re able to
follow the water-maturation process. Keeping a log is important — and not
only for water chemistry results.
A well-kept log helps you pinpoint when and how situations progressed in
your aquarium. It also provides you with an interesting history of your aquar-
ium that you and your family will probably enjoy reading now and at some
point down the road.
An aquarium log need not be complicated. Mine is just a simple notebook. I
mark the date on the left side of the page and make all kinds of notes on the
right. You can also subdivide your notebook into sections for each general
category. For example, the fish section can have an individual page or two 
for each animal so that the history of that critter is all in one place.
Keep your notebook close to the aquarium and encourage all the fish watch-
ers to make notations. This way, patterns of observations can be established
even if you’re not there all the time.
The following sections give you some idea for the types of notes to make in
your log.
279
Chapter 19: Observing Your Fish

Comings and goings
Write down when you add fish and invertebrates to your aquarium and 
when you remove them. This allows you to follow the progress of any new
additions or the effects of taking a fish or invertebrate away. For example, if
you suspect that one particular fish is bullying the others, but you haven’t
personally seen it, you may need to isolate that fish for a week. You can then
follow the progress of your other fish to see whether conditions improve. To
do this, you have to make note of when events happen.
Take notes about new arrivals — in particular, how they interact with others
or with the aquarium. For example, “Just placed new lionfish in tank, and he
immediately consumed the clownfish” or “New damselfish is shy and seems
to hide a lot; need to keep an eye on it.”
Fish interactions and behavior
Write down your observations on animal behavior and interactions. This
does not only pertain to when you add or remove a tank inhabitant: Make
notes whenever you see something worth noting.
Suppose you’re relaxing and fish watching when suddenly your triggerfish
nips your cardinalfish and the latter quickly swims away and hides. You
should write this down for a couple of reasons. First, this agonistic behavior
may be an isolated incident or a recurring situation. You won’t know unless
you make note of it. Second, if your cardinalfish starts to show signs of
stress, you’ll know why.
Most of the fish and invertebrate interactions you see are probably associ-
ated with aggressive or agonistic behavior (see Chapter 3 for a discussion 
of agonistic behavior). In many aggressive relationships, a pecking order is
established, and the fish sort it out themselves. If not, one of the fish should
be removed before the situation gets out of hand. If the aggressor is a general
aquarium bully, it must go. However, if the fish being picked on is getting
injured, it must be relocated to a more peaceful setting.
Feedings
Question: What is one of the first signs of stress? Answer: loss of appetite. If
you notice that a fish or invertebrate isn’t eating, write it down. If a fish or
280
Part IV: Taking Proper Care of Your Fish 

invertebrate is eating too much, write it down. If a fish is eating only one kind
of food, write it down. If a particular food type is not liked at all, write it down.
Face it, you can’t remember everything. Writing down these observations
helps determine whether there are any consistent patterns worth following.
Because feeding is such an important aspect of keeping your fish and aquar-
ium healthy, don’t be afraid to keep detailed notes on feeding behavior, food
types, feeding times, and food quantities.
New equipment
Any time you replace or add equipment to your aquarium, note it in your log.
This way, if anything changes dramatically after adding that equipment, you’ll
know why. Suppose, for example, your dealer recommends a different fluores-
cent light bulb for your aquarium to improve invertebrate health. You buy it,
use it for several months, and find that your invertebrates are no better off.
By checking your notes, you can pinpoint the amount of time you’ve been
using the bulbs and evaluate their efficacy.
It doesn’t take long to write down, “Added new airstones to undergravel
filter.” Take the few seconds to do it, and you’ll have an excellent mainte-
nance record.
Problems
If something goes wrong, make note of it. This way, you can follow patterns if
they develop. Filter failure, heater malfunction, and even air tube clogging are
routine incidents that can stress your fish. If you know when they happened,
you may be able to find the cause of any future problems.
Here’s an example of a hypothetical but possible situation. You come home
from a long weekend away and find your butterflyfish hiding in the corner of
the tank and not interested in food. You have not been there and don’t know
what might be wrong. Fortunately, your wife Kimberly took care of the fish,
fed them, and made sure that aquarium conditions were stable. So, what hap-
pened? You pick up your log and notice that Kimberly found cooler water
temperatures on Saturday and had trouble getting the heater to work. She
also observed that the butterflyfish was not interested in food. Bingo, tem-
perature stress and a possible heater problem. See what I mean?
281
Chapter 19: Observing Your Fish

General notes
You don’t need to be feeding your fish, adding or removing an animal, having
a problem, or adding equipment to make notes in your aquarium log. Any
note that reminds you to do something is helpful. For example, my notes
from last week say, “Need to stop watching fish and finish that book!”
This general note-taking will come in handy when you decide to write your
own book about saltwater aquariums. Just remember me when you become 
a famous author.
Taking Pictures
Taking photos was one of my father’s passions that he passed on to me and
my brother Paul. There may come a time when you too want to photograph
your aquarium and its inhabitants. Photography is truly my other favorite
hobby, and I’ve spent literally thousands of hours and thousands of dollars
underwater trying to get photos of fish and invertebrates in their natural
environment. It’s amazing how much time, effort, and money I could’ve saved
had I just photographed the animals in my aquarium — and I wouldn’t have
had to get wet.
I can think of a number of great reasons to take photos of your pets: to show
off, to follow the history of a particular animal, to preserve the memory of a
critter, or to publish photos. Whatever your reason, I strongly encourage
aquarium photography. Like maintaining the aquarium itself, photographing
your fish can be frustrating because your subjects don’t always cooperate.
But the process is also a lot of fun.
Nowadays, many types of cameras are on the market. Over the years, I’ve
come to prefer a 35mm single lens reflex (SLR) film camera for all my photog-
raphy. But the times, they are a-changing, and digital cameras are the way to
go. They make it easier to edit and to e-mail your photos, as well. And prices
on digital SLRs keep coming down, though they are still more expensive.
Regardless of the kind of camera you choose, make sure you use a flash or
strobe when taking photos of your aquarium. The lights in your aquarium 
generally don’t provide sufficient lighting for photography. In addition, the
quality of the lighting usually results in strange colors, like green or orange,
in your photos. Therefore, you need to add strong lighting from a flash unit 
or electronic strobe. Keep in mind that the more light you add, the better 
the photos.
282
Part IV: Taking Proper Care of Your Fish 

This is not a book on photography, so I don’t cover any photography basics.
However, the following are a few pointers to taking good aquarium photos:
 Mount the camera on a tripod or something sturdy so that you avoid
camera movement and blurred photos at slower shutter speeds.
 Match the camera lens to the size of the subject and composition of the
photograph. A 50mm lens is good for larger fish, but a macro lens may
be required for smaller subjects. A zoom lens gives you both options
and allows you to vary your composition.
 Make every effort to direct the flash at a 45-degree angle to the glass of
the aquarium. If you don’t, your photos will have a bright white spot
from the reflection.
 Pay attention to focus and depth of field so that what you see is what
you get. The depth of field determines what’s in focus and what isn’t. 
For example, you may want the blenny on the coral in focus, but not the
decorations behind it. You can manipulate your depth of field with your
aperture setting.
 Compose your photo so that it has a subject. I have lots and lots of
photos of my aquarium that look busy because there is no center of
interest. Now if I’m taking panoramic photos, I try to compose it with 
an element of central interest. This doesn’t mean the center of interest
needs to be in the center of the photo. In fact, most photographic
experts feel that your subject should be positioned one third the way
across the frame. In the case of close-ups, I try to fill the frame with the
subject as much as possible.
 Be creative. You may shoot something that you love, but everybody else
looks at it and shrugs. So what? We all swim to a different current, or
something like that, so go with what pleases you.

Ten Fish to Avoid
In This Chapter
 Knowing which fish will only cause you aggravation
 Steering clear of the bad apples
I
n Chapter 3, I list a number of individual species that aren’t well suited to
the beginner’s aquarium. In this chapter, I emphasize some families of fish
that tend to be a problem in captivity, particularly for the community aquar-
ium or reef tank. Of course, each group may contain one or two exceptions.
Sharks
It’s a natural desire to have sharks in your aquarium, but you want to avoid
them for a number of reasons. Most of the more than 360 species of sharks
are simply too big for the average aquarist. Did you know that only a handful
of shark species have been successfully kept in captivity, and that includes
large, public aquaria? Besides, most sharks are predatory carnivores that will
eat everything in your aquarium.
Skates and Rays
Skates and rays are flattened relatives of the sharks, and like their cousins, I
don’t recommend them for the average aquarium. Both groups grow to large
sizes and prefer to eat invertebrates, so keep them out of your aquarium.
Stonefish
These fishes possess venom glands near the base of their needle-like dorsal fin
spines. The neurotoxin of these fish is the most deadly of the fish venoms and
can be fatal to humans. They typically camouflage themselves as rocks, which
means they aren’t very attractive, either. Leave stonefish care to the experts.

Moray Eels
Moray eels are cool-looking fish that belong to the family Muraenidae.
Morays are generally nocturnal fish that feed on other fish and invertebrates
(including yours) at night, spending most of their daytime hours in holes and
crevices, so they’re not much fun to observe. Also, in the wild, these fish
grow very large and easily attain lengths in excess of 5 feet.
Lionfishes and Scorpionfishes
These predators hover or lie in wait for their prey, suddenly lunging at and
engulfing them. Although their camouflaged coloration aids them in doing 
so, their venomous spines protect them from predators. For obvious reasons,
these fish must be handled with great care. In captivity, they will readily con-
sume smaller tank mates. The novice is advised to avoid them — they don’t
belong in a reef tank.
Boxfishes and Trunkfishes
These box-shaped fishes of the family Ostraciidae release poisons into the
water when threatened and are, therefore, poorly suited for the average
aquarium. Some of the boxfishes are also intolerant of their own kind. Who
needs this in an aquarium?
Groupers and Sea Basses
The family Serranidae comprises fast-growing, large, predatory fishes. 
Most species require a large aquarium that’s populated with other large fish.
Otherwise, groupers and sea basses will quickly outgrow your aquarium and
will probably eat many of your smaller fishes in the process. Don’t let their
small size in the pet store surprise you: They grow up and grow up fast. In
addition, many of the groupers are nocturnal, spending most of their day
hiding or lying on the bottom. That’s not fun to watch.
288
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Parrotfishes
These fishes prefer to feed on algae, using their beaks to bite off pieces of
dead coral to get at it. For this reason, parrotfishes aren’t well suited to the
reef aquarium. In general, these fish grow relatively large, which also makes
them a poor choice for the average fish-only aquarium.
Snappers
Snappers are another group of fast-growing, highly active fishes that, as
adults, aren’t suitable for the average marine aquarium. They are predatory
by nature, require a lot of space, and quickly dominate an aquarium.
Seahorses
Seahorses are delicate and exotic fishes that are difficult to feed and require
very high water quality, so keeping them alive is challenging for the beginner.
Because they don’t compete well for food with other species, seahorses live
best in a quiet aquarium by themselves.

Ten Invertebrates to Avoid
In This Chapter
 Staying away from spineless troublemakers
 Making buying decisions that will save you grief
W
ith so many kinds of invertebrates (see Chapter 4), I have a tough time
singling out just ten that aren’t for the average saltwater aquarium. In
fact, there are thousands that aren’t suitable, but in this chapter, I list ten that
you may encounter at your aquarium dealer.
Octopuses
These critters are incredible attractive cephalopods and every aquarist I
know is intrigued by them. Unfortunately, most octopuses are large, crafty,
and predatory in the tank. They are also quite delicate, rarely living very long
in captivity. Why waste the money?
Crown of Thorns Starfish
This species of starfish is not a friendly invertebrate. Instead, it is a predator
on the reefs, eating corals left and right. If you plan to have a reef tank, avoid
these funky-looking starfish.
Bristleworms
These polychaete worms are rarely purchased, but they usually end up in
your aquarium hitchhiking on live rocks. They are named after the bristles
that line their sides. These bristles are sharp and can easily irritate you if you
handle them. Although small bristleworms are relatively harmless, larger
ones can damage corals and must be removed.

Mantis Shrimp
Mantis shrimps are nasty, ill-tempered crustaceans capable of inflicting a seri-
ous injury with their powerful, spear-like arms. They are efficient predators
of other invertebrates and fishes. This is one shrimp that doesn’t act like one.
Jellyfish
Jellyfish aren’t the most common aquarium invertebrates for a number of
reasons. Although public aquaria do display jellyfish, they go through a lot of
work to do so. Jellyfish require far too much work for the average aquarist in
terms of water quality, aquarium conditions, and food. If someone offers you
jellyfish, just say no.
Queen Conch
The shell of this large gastropod is probably the most popular curio in the
tropics. The beauty of this animal and its shell often entices the new aquar-
ists to add a small one to their aquarium. Don’t do it! These snails get large. 
If you want a queen conch, collect a shell.
Lobsters
If you place a lobster in your aquarium in the evening, by morning you will 
no longer recognize your aquarium. These feisty decapod crustaceans are
disruptive and territorial, not to mention cannibalistic. Do yourself a favor,
don’t add a lobster to your peaceful community aquarium.
Bivalves
Clams, scallops, mussels, and oysters belong in this group. There are all 
different kinds of bivalves, and many of them are beautiful additions to the
aquarium. They are included here because they are strictly filter feeders and
this makes them difficult for a beginner to accommodate. Practice aquarium
upkeep before you add these challenging species with special feeding
requirements.
292
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Sea Cucumbers
Although some species of sea cucumbers are okay for the aquarium, as a
beginner, avoid these critters. When some sea cucumbers are stressed, they
release toxins into the tank, and you don’t want that.
Fire Coral
Although these cnidarians are actually not coral, they are named after the
feeling you get when you touch them. When these animals sting you, you feel
as if you’ve been burned. For this reason alone, you don’t need any species of
fire coral in your aquarium.

Five Simple Metric Conversions
In This Chapter
 Getting the lowdown on the metric system
 Making quick and easy conversions
T
he units of measurement in this book are given in customary U.S. units
(inches, feet, gallons, pounds). However, in the rest of the world and in
the scientific community, the accepted units of measurement are metric
(meters, liters, kilograms). The simple conversions in this chapter help you
to translate your American aquarium into one that’s recognized worldwide.
Temperature
To convert Fahrenheit to Celsius (which is the temperature scale used in
most of the world), use the following formula:
°C = (°F - 32) × 0.5556
To convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, use the following formula:
°F = (1.8 × °C) + 32
Length Conversion
The metric system is based on units of 10, and the basic unit of length is the
meter. Measurements are made in meters or increments of meters, which are
named with different prefixes. The basic prefixes are milli (1/1000), centi
(1/100), and kilo (1000), and each represents an increment of 10. Therefore:
1,000 millimeters (mm) = 1 meter (m)
100 centimeters (cm) = 1 m
1,000 m = 1 kilometer (km)

The U.S. uses inches and feet to measure length, whereas the metric system
uses centimeters and meters.
To convert inches (in) to centimeters (cm), multiply by 2.54.
To convert feet (ft) to meters (m), multiply by 0.3048.
To convert centimeters to inches, multiply by 0.3937.
To convert meters to feet, multiply by 3.28.
Weight Conversion
Just as the meter is the basis for length, the gram is the basis for weight. 
The prefixes for length also apply for weight. Therefore,
1000 milligrams (mg) = 1 gram (g)
1000 g = 1 kilogram (kg)
The standard U.S. units of weight are pounds, whereas kilograms are 
standard metric units.
To convert pounds (lbs) to kilograms (kg), multiply by 0.4536.
To convert kilograms to pounds, multiply by 2.2.
Always take into account the weight of your aquarium when it is full 
with water.
One gallon of saltwater weighs 8.4 pounds.
One liter of saltwater weighs 1.01 kilograms. See the “Volume
Conversions” section for more on liters.
Area Conversion
The surface area of anything is simply the product of the length and the
width or
Area = length × width
296
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Using the U.S. system, area is usually reported as square inches or square
feet because the unit of measurement is squared (inches × inches = inches
squared).
To convert square inches to square centimeters, multiply by 6.4516.
To convert square centimeters to square inches, multiply by 0.155.
Volume Conversions
Volume is equal to the product of length, width, and height or
Volume = length × width × height
In the United States, we usually report this as cubic inches because multiplying
inches times inches times inches results in the inches cubed. We also report
volume in U.S. gallons. The metric system uses cubic centimeters and liters.
To convert cubic inches to cubic centimeters, multiply by 0.061.
To convert cubic centimeters to cubic inches, multiply by 16.39.
1,000 cubic centimeters = 1 liter (l) = 1 kilogram (kg).
To convert gallons to liters, multiply by 3.78.
To convert liters to gallons, multiply by 0.2642.

Ten Great Public 
Saltwater Aquariums 
In This Chapter
 Knowing where to see excellent displays of marine life
 Seeing how the professionals do it
I
s there anybody who doesn’t like going to a big public aquarium? I don’t
think so. There is so much to see and learn at an aquarium that there’s
usually not enough time to see it all in one day. For the home aquarist, the
large public aquarium is also a great place to see just how a healthy aquar-
ium should look. These places are also loaded with information about fish,
invertebrates, marine mammals, reptiles, and amphibians. Don’t be afraid 
to steal an idea or two about aquarium decoration, species composition, 
and the re-creation of natural settings. 
I’ve been to public aquariums all over the United States; here are a bunch
that I really liked. This is in no way a comprehensive list of aquariums, just a
smattering. No matter where you live, there’s an aquarium not too far away.
So, if you don’t see one close to you listed here, poke around online and
you’ll find one.
New England Aquarium
Since I’m from the northeast and still live there, the New England Aquarium
in Boston, Massachusetts was one of the first large public aquariums that I
ever visited. In fact, I dare say that the Giant Ocean Tank loaded with all kinds
of fishes, including sharks, helped to inspire me to become a marine biologist
and home aquarist. Check it out online as well at www.neaq.org.

Mystic Aquarium
Located in, you guessed it, Mystic, Connecticut, this aquarium not only
houses all kind of fish and invertebrates, but is well known for its incredible
display of beluga whales. The aquarium is also home to the world-renowned
Institute for Ocean Exploration, which is something you don’t want to miss.
You can start your visit to Mystic Aquarium at www.mysticaquarium.org.
National Aquarium
The next time you’re kicking around the beautiful waterfront in Baltimore,
Maryland, you should make it a point to visit the National Aquarium (www.
aqua.org). This aquarium is chock full of all kinds of animals including birds,
amphibians, and reptiles and has an incredible dolphin amphitheater.
Georgia Aquarium
Touted as the largest aquarium in the world, the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta
(www.goergiaaquarium.org) is an incredible facility with over eight mil-
lion gallons of marine and fresh water and over 120,000 animals representing
500 species. One of the highlights of the aquarium is the Ocean Voyager
gallery, which allows you to view the largest fish species in the world, the
whale shark, through a 100-foot underwater tunnel.
Sea World
The Sea World name is synonymous with ocean-oriented parks and combines
animal attractions with rides, shows, dining, and shopping. With parks in
Orlando, Florida, San Antonio, Texas, and San Diego, California, Sea World
offers a little of everything for everyone, including that oddball family member
that doesn’t like fish. Of course, a visit to Sea World (www.seaworld.com)
would not be complete without taking in a show with the infamous killer
whale Shamu.

Part V: The Part of Tens 

Tennessee Aquarium
Now, granted, people usually don’t think of Chattanooga, Tennessee when it
come to saltwater, but the Tennessee Aquarium (www.tnaqua.org) has a
fantastic collection of marine animals. Also, this may a book for the salt-
water enthusiast, but our freshwater counterparts are people, too, and the
Tennessee Aquarium is among the largest freshwater aquariums in the world.
Audubon Aquarium of the Americas
How do you combine great music, fantastic food, and marine life? You go to 
the Aquarium of the Americas in New Orleans, of course. Having conducted
research in the bayous of Louisiana, I can tell you that these unique habitats
house some of the toughest critters in the world, like bull sharks, alligator gars,
and catfishes. But you don’t have to brave the mosquitoes to see all these crit-
ters and more if you drop by this aquarium (www.auduboninstitute.org). 
Monterey Bay Aquarium
Located in a quaint, historic Monterey, California, this aquarium offers a 
phenomenal and incredibly natural re-creation of Pacific marine habitats and
their inhabitants. With exhibits ranging from kelp forests to the open ocean,
this aquarium has all kinds of Pacific fishes and animals including sea otters
and penguins. My personal favorite is the Outer Bay exhibit, which houses
giant bluefin tuna, ocean sunfish, and the only captive white shark. See more
of the aquarium at www.mbayaq.org.

Appendixes

In this part . . .
I
n the two appendixes, you will find a list of clubs, 
magazines, and Web sites as well as a glossary of fish
and aquarium terms.

Appendix A
Resources
H
ome aquarists number in the millions throughout the world. As long 
as you have an aquarium, you will never be alone in this hobby. As you
become more involved in aquarium keeping, you may be surprised at how
many people share this avocation. I find myself going to my local pet dealer
to see new fish arrivals, talk about aquarium problems, and exchange ideas
with fellow aquarists. I’ve picked up some of the most valuable information
on fishkeeping from amateurs who enjoy the thrills of this hobby. The
resources for the home aquarist are almost limitless, ranging from books 
to the Internet.
Books
Though I’d like nothing better than to say that the book you’re holding in
your hand is the only one you’re going to need, I can’t. This book is really 
just the beginning, and literally thousands of books have been published 
on aquarium keeping. Some are good, some aren’t. I happen to think the one
you’re reading is very good. Books have been written to address virtually
every aspect of the hobby. They cover broad topics, such as basic aquarium
setup, and specialized topics, like the proper husbandry of a certain species.
If you have any questions about aquarium keeping, it’s covered in a book.
The following list of books includes some that I think are helpful, but this is a
mere smattering of what’s available for the new and experienced aquarist.
Each one of the books listed below has its own bibliography, which can help
you delve even further into the field.

Clubs
In virtually every state in the United States, aquarium buffs have formed
clubs and associations in which ideas and techniques are endlessly bantered
about. The best way to find these organizations is to ask your local pet dealer
or jump online and do a search — many clubs have Web pages.
Not only are these kinds of organizations great for gathering information, but
they also can help you acquire equipment and healthy, home-bred fish.
Magazines
Monthly aquarium magazines provide you with some of the most up-to-date
information on keeping an aquarium. Timely articles on breeding, feeding, 
disease, and species-specific husbandry both entertain and inform the new
aquarist. In addition, product information and classified advertising are excel-
lent features of any aquarium magazine. The photos are pretty cool, as well.
Following are the most popular magazines that have proven to be good 
conduits of information.

Internet
The amount and quality of the aquarium information available on the 
Internet is unbelievable. It’s become the de facto place where people gather 
to exchange information about the aquarium-keeping hobby. The World Wide
Web is by far the fastest and most comprehensive way to obtain and exchange
information on saltwater aquariums. If you have access to the Internet, you
have unlimited access to the vast amount of information on this hobby online.
Internet resources include Web sites, chat groups, places to buy equipment,
photos, links to further resources, husbandry information, classified ads,
aquarium-related events, and on and on and on.
There are Internet networks for saltwater fish enthusiasts that you can 
join. Doing so gives you access to other hobbyists, professional aquarists,
researchers, breeders, and vendors of aquarium products. In many cases 
you can even get immediate advice from staff about your sick fish.
