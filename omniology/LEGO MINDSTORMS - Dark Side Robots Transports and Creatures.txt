Hideaki Yabuki works as a Media Activist promoting new technologies to the
next generation. To him, robotics is the most important of these technologies. He
was ﬁrst introduced to LEGO robots in 1985 by a friend of his, Mr. Kurita, who
had recently returned from the MIT Media Lab with some LEGO Dacta products.
Inﬂuenced also by Dr. Seymour Papert’s book, Mindstorms: Children, Computers,
and Powerful Ideas, Hideaki feels that LEGOs offer a hands-on approach to
learning that is often missing these days in our digital world. His robot in this
book, the Scorpion, is the result of much trial and error on his part. Hideaki
would like to thank J.P. Brown, without whom he could not have become
involved with this book. He would also like to thank Kevin Clague, inventor of
the LPub application for semi-automated LEGO instruction creation. Lastly,
Hideaki would like to give his deepest thanks for the support of his mother, Rei,
and his dear wife and son, Keiko and Kei. Hideaki has a dream that one day the
people of Japan will be able to join hands with biped robots as friends. 
Kevin Clague graduated in 1983 from Iowa State University with a bachelor’s of
Science degree in Computer Engineering. For the past 18 years, Kevin has worked
as a Diagnostic Engineer at the Amdahl Corporation. For the last two years, he has
also acted as a Senior Staff Engineer doing veriﬁcation work at Sun Microsystems
on their Ultra-Sparc V RISC processor. Kevin has two major hobbies: theatrical
lighting and LEGO MINDSTORMS. Kevin has been playing with the RIS 1.5 for
several years now and is currently working on LPub, an application to revolu-
tionize the world of creating online LEGO building instructions.
Miguel Agullo was born in Spain but has lived abroad for long periods of time,
from the Far East to South America, from central Europe to the U.S. His wide
range of interests is responsible for his work in such diverse industries as
ﬁnance, media, aeronautics, and antique trading. Trained as a journalist and
impressed with the candor and resourcefulness of the online LEGO community,
Miguel tries to give something back by regularly updating his Web site at
www.geocities.com/technicpuppy with instructions for new models, new Ldraw
pieces, and anything he thinks is worth sharing with other LEGO aﬁcionados.
His building interests revolve around robotics, and speciﬁcally biomechanics: cre-
ating mechanisms that mimic the behavior of natural devices such as legs or
arms. His creations include biped walkers, robots that jump, and a fully func-
tional (including a brake!) LEGO motorcycle. His current hobbies include
Contributors

viii
boating, biking, traveling and learning Thai and Dutch (his wife is Thai and they
live in Amsterdam, which explains the bike and the boat).
Søren Rolighed is a data warehouse consultant, working on building and main-
taining databases for telco-data in the largest data warehouse in Denmark. Like
almost all Danish kids, he started playing with LEGO at an early age. As an
adult he has continued with his passion for LEGOs, and the introduction of the
LEGO Technics and LEGO MINDSTORMS kits opened up a whole new world of
possibilities! Søren enjoys building LEGO Mindstorm robots and programming
them with his computer. He would like to thank his three great children, Emma,
Oscar, and Victor, for their patience and understanding when dad has to requisi-
tion all of their interesting motors, gears, and special parts for his own LEGO
creations. Søren and his family live in Copenhagen, Denmark. 
J.P. Brown is a Consultant Environmental Conservator who has worked on such
historical sites as Independence Hall, Philadelphia, PA and George Washington’s
mansion, Mount Vernon, VA. He ﬁrst became interested in LEGO MINDSTORMS
in July 1999, but his interest did not really take off until he discovered Dave
Baum’s Not Quite C (NQC) programming environment for the RCX brick later
that year. He quickly became involved as a moderator for LEGO MINDSTORMS
forums on the Web, and was later selected by LEGO as a preview builder for the
MINDSTORMS Vision Command system (along with Søren Rolighed and several
others). His robot, Biped II, won the February 2001 MINDSTORMS Hall of Fame,
Special Competition, but he is perhaps best known for his Rubik’s Cube solving
robot, CubeSolver, which was featured in the New York Times in October 2001
and other papers around the world.

Foreword
xi
This book is the result of a lifetime exploring the world of LEGO. As a kid, I
loved taking mechanical things apart to figure out how they worked, then
either putting them back together or using the parts to invent something new,
so I really enjoyed playing with LEGOs—despite the fact that the things I built
often fell apart! Eventually, though, I grew out of them. Several years after I
grew out of this first LEGO phase, LEGO introduced the TECHNIC line of
LEGOs, a superior set of building parts allowing sturdy structures and compli-
cated designs with gears, levers, and all kinds of moving mechanics, and then
introduced the MINDSTORMS line. Two and a half years ago, my wife got me
the LEGO MINDSTORMS Dark Side Developer Kit for Christmas—I immedi-
ately built the AT-AT walker and was hooked on LEGOs all over again. A few
months later, I went out and got the Robot Invention System 1.5, and thus
began my second LEGO phase. LEGO’s TECHNIC and MINDSTORMS kits
have allowed me to pursue both my passion for building with LEGOs and my
interest in all things mechanical.
This book is a first for my co-authors, Syngress, and myself. I’ve really
enjoyed working with and getting to know the other authors (and the people at
Syngress) during the development of this book. The Internet has allowed
Syngress to gather a team of authors from many different countries, including
Britain, Holland, Denmark, Japan, and the United States. Before I began
working on the book, I’d met J.P. Brown in person when he was doing some
consulting work in St. Paul, Minnesota. I’d also had some contact with Miguel
Agullo (a.k.a. “Technic Puppy”) because he runs a Web page dedicated specifi-
cally to LEGO biped robots, which are my favorite type of robot to invent. I’d
heard of Soren Rolighed because he made it into the LEGO MINDSTORMS
Hall of Fame, and I’d also heard of Hideaki Yabuki (a.k.a. “Joda”, which is

Japanese for Yoda) because I saw one of his fabulous grabber arms featured on
the LEGO MINDSTORMS Web site. 
When Jonathan Babcock at Syngress first contacted me about working on
10 Cool LEGO MINDSTORMS Dark Side Robots, Transports, and Creatures, he
told me it was going to be a step-by-step building instruction book. I was
curious how we were going to lay out all the artwork for the book, and
Syngress didn’t initially have a firm plan on how this would be done. After
talking it out with Jonathan, it was decided that I would write some tools to
help do the job. Many tools had already been developed by others and given
away over the Internet for the LEGO community to share. I know that without
those tools this book would never have made it to press as polished and as
quickly as it has.
The groundwork for all the tools used was laid out by the late James
Jessiman. James created the LDraw program on which all the other tools are
based. MLCad, written by Michael Lachmann, is a second-generation computer
aided design (CAD) program that is used to enter robotic designs. The third
tool that we use is L3P, written by Lars C. Hassing. L3P converts LDraw files to
POV-Ray files. POV-Ray is the program that produces the final images that you
see in this book. POV-Ray has a long history of contributors. The Windows ver-
sion we used was coordinated by Chris Cason.
I wrote a program called LPub for this book that combines all these tools
together to generate the step-by-step construction images and the corresponding
part-list images. The development of LPub has been an adventure in and of
itself, and has kept me very busy over the past several months. I will be
cleaning it up, making it more robust, and making it available for all to use in
the near future.
I hope you enjoy building the robots in this book—some very creative
minds have done some amazing work inventing the robots you’ll find here. We
encourage you to use your own creativity to modify our designs after you’ve
built some of them, in the true LEGO building tradition. 
If you like this book—and I think you will—be sure to look for two similar
books that Syngress will be putting out in the near future: 10 Cool LEGO
MINDSTORMS Robotics Invention System 2.0 Projects: Amazing Projects You
Can Build in Under an Hour (ISBN 1-931836-61-2) and 10 Cool LEGO MIND-
STORMS Ultimate Builders Projects: Amazing Projects You Can Build in Under
an Hour (ISBN 1-931836-60-4).

Super Battle Droid

In Episode II: Attack of the Clones, the evil Sith lord Darth Sidious headed a
separatist movement in the Republic, with the nefarious goal of ruling the
entire galaxy. Darth Sideous had turned Jedi Knight Count Dooku to the dark
side, and used him to lead the separatist movement. The Techno Union, one of
the members of the separatist movement, created an army of Super Battle
Droids, which were more powerful and aggressive than the Battle Droids used
by the Trade Federation in Episode 1: The Phantom Menace.
We first heard of the Clone Wars in Episode IV: A New Hope, when Luke
Skywalker and old Ben Kenobi (Obi-Wan) were talking about Luke’s father. In
Episode II, on the planet Geonosis, we see the start of the Clone Wars, as the
Jedi Knights wage war with the Battle Droid and Super Battle Droid army to
rescue Senator Amadala, Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, and his Padawan,
Anakin Skywalker.
In this chapter you will build a LEGO Mindstorms version of a Super Battle
Droid. It is a biped that walks on two legs by shifting its weight from side to
side and moving its legs forwards and backwards. Building the Super Battle
Droid can be tricky because the side-to-side weight shifting needs to be timed
just right to match the legs going forwards and backwards. 
Bricks & Chips…
Micro Scout Programs
Since Super Battle Droid can walk both forwards and in reverse, you
can use any of the programs that come with the Micro Scout to
power it.

The Body
The body is the heart of the Super Battle Droid. As such, we will construct it first, and then build
each of the sub-assemblies that will be added to the body to create the finished Droid. 
Body Step: 1
Make sure that two of the 3
holed struts (of which you
are using 4 in this step) are
pointing straight up. The two
3 holed struts on the
opposite side should be
pointing straight 
down (see 
picture).

through its middle hole (the 
third from either end).
Body Step: 4
When adding the axle and gears in Body Step: 4,
make sure that the moving parts at the far end
are positioned as shown in this image. It is also
important to make sure the gears allow the #10
axle to be oriented as
shown.

The arms are perhaps the easiest sub-
assembly to customize on the Super
Battle Droid. Using the pieces found in
the Dark Side Developer’s Kit and other
LEGO kits, a wide variety of different
possibilities for the arms are available.
You could try building a sword,
hands, or a variety of tools.

beveled gear for this leg, make sure that the small gray
pulley goes behind the red gear, and that the gear
itself meshes with the other red 12t beveled gear
already attached to the leg. The gray pulley should be
between the red gear you just added to the axle and
the body of the Super Battle Droid. Make sure all the
moving parts’ alignments match this picture.

Orbital Defense Cannon

Orbital Defense Cannons are huge pieces of laser artillery that planets in the
Alliance use to defend against bombardment from orbiting ships. Their dual
laser cannons, guided by a targeting radar dish, can shoot down even the
largest Imperial Star Destroyers and Corellian Cruisers. Many planets that can’t
afford to outfit a full fleet of starships choose instead to protect themselves
from Imperial Starfleet attacks from space with Orbital Defense Cannons.
In order for the gears to work properly it is important that the Orbital
Defense Cannon is sitting on a flat surface. 
Bricks & Chips…
Micro Scout Programs
The Orbital Defense Cannon works best with Micro Scout programs
#2 and #3. Program #2 will turn the Orbital Defense Cannon around
in circles and “fire” its dual laser cannons. With program #3, the
Orbital Defense Cannon will turn in circles and rotate its radar,
“firing” its dual laser cannons when you trigger the Micro Scout with
a light source (like a flashlight).

Imperial AT-ST

The Imperial All-Terrain Scout Transport, better known as the AT-ST, is a small,
agile, armored biped that can carry two Imperial Stormtroopers. Used primarily
for scouting and reconnaissance patrols by Imperial troops, the AT-ST is a force
to be reckoned with. While not as large or powerful as the AT-AT, its quickness
and agility make it a relentless and implacable foe, and its twin laser cannons
can make short work of most infantry and light vehicles. AT-STs were used in
the battles of Hoth and Endor, as seen in Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back
and Episode VI: Return of the Jedi. 
The LEGO Mindstorms version of the AT-ST presented here is an excellent
example of a biped robot. Like the other bipeds in this book, the AT-ST walks
by shifting its weight from side to side and forward and backward. In some
ways, the AT-ST robot is very similar to the Super Battle Droid robot also pre-
sented in this book.

Customizing the Face
You might want to add more decoration to the face, or add weapon pods to the sides of
the head to accompany the laser cannons already in place, as on the AT-STs from the
Star Wars movies. Be careful: Doing so could change the overall balance of the robot. If
the AT-ST starts to fall forward on its face, you can compensate for the weight by
adjusting the feet farther forward on the legs, or by adding some more bricks to the rear
of the AT-ST. Don’t be afraid to experiment!

Go-Rilla

Robot 4 • Go-Rilla
80
The Go-Rillas are fast biped robots often used by the smugglers and bounty
hunters of the galaxy to defend their hideouts. Capable of following only
simple commands, a Go-Rilla is not nearly as intelligent as most Droids, but
what it lacks in intelligence is more than made up for in speed and brute
strength. This robot makes the ideal guardian, capable of running down and
trampling with its enormous legs any intruders who enter its field of vision.
Stomping around within a territory set by their owners, Go-Rillas will make
any intruders think twice before attacking, be they Jedi Masters or a patrol of
Imperial Stormtroopers. 
The Go-Rilla is the fastest of the three biped robots in this book. Let’s take
a moment to look at what it is that makes biped robots so unique. 
All bipeds have one talent in common: the ability to balance. There are two
important concepts behind balancing. The first is the idea of a footprint and the
other is center of gravity. Your robot’s footprint is the shape formed by the
points of contact with the ground; a biped’s footprint is like a box drawn
around the supporting “feet.” To balance, a biped needs to keep its center of
gravity within the boundaries of that footprint. Any weight added outside of the
footprint would cause the center of gravity to shift outside the footprint,
causing the biped to fall over—unless it can be balanced out by a weight out-
side the opposite side of the footprint that shifts the center of gravity back
inside its boundaries. 
The center of gravity has three dimensions that affect it: side-to-side, front-
to-back and top-to-bottom. Super Battle Droid, AT-ST, and Go-Rilla each have
similar side-to-side and front-to-back dimensions that affect their centers of
gravity. However, a Go-Rilla’s top-to-bottom dimension is much lower to the
ground than the other two bipeds, which makes it more stable. Also, a Go-
Rilla’s top-to-bottom center of gravity is very near its hips (where it leans side
to side), which allows it to shift its weight side-to-side much faster than the
Super Battle Droid or AT-ST. These factors allow it to take many more steps per
minute than the other two bipeds.
Bricks & Chips…
Micro Scout Programs
Go-Rilla can only walk forward, so it should be used with Micro Scout
program number 1.

The Drive
The drive sub-assembly is the most important sub-assembly of the Go-Rilla. The drive sub-assembly
includes both the body of the Go-Rilla and the large hips. Later, you will attach to the hips the huge
legs that are so characteristic of the Go-Rilla and LEGO Mindstorms bipeds in general.

Inventing…
Customizing the Go-Rilla
The Go-Rilla’s center of gravity plays a very important role
in allowing him to move so quickly—however, this also
makes it one of the most difficult Droids in this book to
customize. Any additions to one side of the Go-Rilla will
have to be balanced out on the opposite side. For
example, if you add some facial features to the front of
the Go-Rilla, you will need to add something to its back
as well to compensate for the shift in weight.

X-Stormer

The X-Stormer, a four-legged transport and combat vehicle, was a prototype of
what would eventually become the AT-AT. Imperial engineers worked for many
years to create the X-Stormers, but once the newer AT-ATs were introduced to
the Imperial Army, the X-Stormers were quickly phased out. However, many of
them ended up on the black market, where they were picked up by a variety of
interested buyers. Rumor has it that the Hutts own several of these surplus X-
Stormers, although what they intend to do with them is unknown.
The X-Stormer needs two rubber bands to make its head bounce up and
down as it jumps. We recommend small rubber bands like the ones orthodon-
tists use in dental work if you can find them.

Droid Transporter

The Droid Transporter is a common vehicle found on most planets in the
galaxy. With its heavy wheels and long loading ramp, the Droid Transporter
can carry up to a dozen Droids over rough terrain and deliver them where they
are needed. Since the Trade Federation and other groups often need to deliver
Battle Droids to dangerous areas, some models come equipped with shielding
and laser cannons. 
The Droid Transporter has two built-in switches that control where the
Micro Scout will supply power during a given action:
I
When both switches are set in the down position, the Droid
Transporter will drive forward and backward; when the motor is in
reverse, the ramp will be lowered.
I
When the right switch is set  in the down position and the left switch
is set in the up position, the Droid Transporter will drive forward and
backward, but the ramp will not be lowered.
I
When the right switch is set in the up position and the left switch is
set in the down position, the Droid Transporter will raise and lower
the ramp (without moving forward or backward).
You will build these switches in Body Steps 25 and 26.

Draigon

Draigons are fierce flying predators who inhabit several planets throughout the
galaxy. They swoop from the sky to attack their prey, carrying off to their lairs
to be devoured those creatures unfortunate enough to become their victims.
Qui-Gon Jinn and the young Obi-Wan Kenobi encountered them on a nameless
watery planet (in Jedi Apprentice Book 1: The Rising Force). The transport ship
they were traveling on, the Monument, crash-landed there after a battle with
Togorian pirates. Intent on making the passengers on board the Monument
their next meal, the Draigons proved to be a challenge even for a Jedi as pow-
erful and experienced as Qui-Gon Jinn, but they were finally defeated. 
The LEGO Mindstorms model of the Draigon presented in this chapter is a
relatively simple six-legged walker. Once you have built the body for the
Draigon, you have a good six-legged base upon which to build your own cus-
tomized robots.

The Body
The body is the main sub-assembly of the Draigon. Since the six legs are so small on the Draigon
(especially when compared to the bipeds presented in this book), we have included them as part of
the body itself.

Scorpion Assassin Droid

The Scorpion Assassin Droids are legendary, mentioned in hushed whispers in
many a cantina and space port throughout the galaxy. No one is certain who
controls them—some say the Hutts, others the Empire, and some even believe
they are their own masters. Nobody knows for sure, but what is known is that
the appearance of a Scorpion Assassin Droid is a sure sign that death is not far
behind. 
Merely the size of a small dog, a Scorpion Assassin Droid is nevertheless a
silent and deadly hunter. Tracking its intended target with a variety of sensors,
it moves stealthily to within striking distance. The final killing blow is deliv-
ered with a lightning fast flick of its barbed tail, injecting a deadly poison into
the victim to which there is no known antidote. Once it acquires a target, it has
never been known to fail.
The Scorpion Assassin Droid requires two pieces that are not found in the
Dark Side Developer’s Kit: two small rubber bands. These should be easy
enough for you to find at home or your local corner store, although you may
have to do some experimenting to find which size works best (we recommend
fairly small rubber bands like the ones orthodontists use for braces if you can
find them). You will use these in the final step of the robot. 
Bricks & Chips…
Micro Scout Programs
To run the Scorpion Assassin Droid, set the Micro Scout to program
#4. Cover the light sensor with your hand and press RUN. When the
Micro Scout stops beeping, remove your hand and the Scorpion
Assassin Droid will begin moving!

Customizing the Scorpion Assassin Droid
Because the Scorpion Battle Droid has four legs, it is very stable compared to the bipeds
presented in this book. This means that there are more options available to you for cus-
tomizing it. For example, try to equip the Scorpion Assassin Droid with wings on its
sides. If you try this, make sure the wings do not interfere with the moving parts already
present (the legs, the tail, and the claws). You could also try different variations on the
tail, but make sure not to make it too heavy or it will not move properly.

Ludic Ordinance Unit (LOU)

Found in most Imperial barracks across the galaxies, Ludic Ordinance Units,
called LOUs, are usually put together by Imperial engineers from bits and
pieces, to create entertainment for the troops. Most end up serving as moving
targets for Imperial Stormtrooper blaster practice after a particularly poor per-
formance. Some, however, turn out to be hilarious comedians and gifted musi-
cians, and are presented from time to time to the Imperial officers for their
amusement. It is rumored that Darth Vader has a personal LOU quartet that
plays private shows for him, but many people dismiss the thought of the
Emperor’s right-hand man enjoying music as preposterous. 
Bricks & Chips…
Micro Scout Programs
A LOU can use any of the Micro Scout programs. However, you will
find that adjusting the arm that strums the guitar is a delicate task,
so you might want to use program #1 for a constant movement.

Imperial Hound

As Imperial troops spread across the galaxy, they often acquired native animals
as pets. Over time they replaced these live prizes with their mechanical equiva-
lents, and thus the Imperial Hounds were born. These Droids serve as both
companions for the troops and as powerful tools of war on the battlefields of
the Empire. They are often used to guard Imperial prisons and compounds, and
also serve as scouts. Darth Vader has a pack of six Imperial Hounds that he can
control with his thoughts, and the Emperor sometimes presents Imperial
Hounds as gifts to officers who have distinguished themselves in the service of
the Empire. 
The Imperial Hound presented here will raise and lower itself on its back
legs and wag its tail. Real Imperial Hounds are seldom in such a good mood!
