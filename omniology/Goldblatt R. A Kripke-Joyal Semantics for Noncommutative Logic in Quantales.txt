A Kripke-Joyal Semantics for
Noncommutative Logic in Quantales
Robert Goldblatt1
abstract. A structural semantics is developed for a ﬁrst-order logic, with
inﬁnite disjunctions and conjunctions, that is characterised algebraically by
quantales. The model structures involved combine the “covering systems”
approach of Kripke-Joyal intuitionistic semantics from topos theory with the
ordered groupoid structures used to model various connectives in substruc-
tural logics. The latter are used to interpret the noncommutative quantal
conjunction & (“and then”) and its residual implication connectives.
The completeness proof uses the MacNeille completion and the theory
of quantic nuclei to ﬁrst embed a residuated semigroup into a quantale, and
then represent the quantale as an algebra of subsets of a model structure.
The ﬁnal part of the paper makes some observations about quantal
modal logic, giving in particular a structural modelling of the logic of closure
operators on quantales.

Introduction
A locale is a complete lattice in which ﬁnite meets distribute over arbi-
trary joins, the motivating example being the lattice of open subsets of a
topological space. Any locale is a Heyting algebra – with the relative pseu-
docomplement a ⇒b being the join of {x : x ⊓a ≤b} – so it provides
algebraic semantics for inﬁnitary ﬁrst-order intuitionistic logic, with ⇒in-
terpreting implication, lattice joins and meets interpreting disjunctions W
and conjunctions V (possibly inﬁnite), and the quantiﬁers ∃and ∀being
treated as special disjunctions and conjunctions, respectively.
The notion of a quantale was introduced by C. J. Mulvey [13] to give a
noncommutative extension of the locale concept that could be applied to
spaces related to the foundations of quantum theory, such as the spectra
of C∗-algebras. A quantale is a complete lattice with an associative (but
possibly not commutative) operation a•b that distributes over joins in each
argument. A locale is then just a quantale in which a • b is the lattice meet
of a and b. Mulvey suggested that • should interpret a logical connective
& that is a kind of “sequential conjunction” with “a vestige of temporality
in its interpretation”. A propositional formula ϕ&ψ is to be read “ϕ and

then ψ”. See [14] for a representation of the spectrum of a C∗-algebra as
the Lindenbaum algebra of a propositional logic of formulas built using this
& and W. The paper [16] gives a novel application of propositional logic
in quantales to the classiﬁcation of Penrose tilings of the plane. Further
information about the way that quantales generalise locales is given in [15].
Since a quantale is complete, it can still interpret all of W, V, ∃and ∀.
It no longer has a Heyting implication ⇒(unless • is commutative), but
instead • has left and right residual operations, ⇒l and ⇒r, which can be
used to interpret two connectives, →l and →r, which we think of as left and
right implication. The aim of this paper is to develop a semantics for the
logic of all these connectives as interpreted in quantales, by combining the
idea of the Kripke-Joyal intuitionistic semantics for W, V, ∃, ∀arising from
topos theory [11, 3] with the models for &, →l, →r in substructural logics
that are based on ordered groupoids ⟨S, ≤, ·⟩[19, 18, 6, 7].
It has long been recognised1 that a binary connective like & can be mod-
elled by a ternary relation R on Kripke-type models, with the semantics
x |= ϕ&ψ
iﬀ
∃y∃z : Rxyz and y |= ϕ and z |= ψ.
This relates naturally to the “and then” reading of & if we view Rxyz as
a relation of relativistic temporal ordering, meaning that y precedes z in
time from the perspective of x. In the groupoid formalism, Rxyz becomes
the condition that y · z ≤x. The Kripke-Joyal semantics uses collections
of sets called “covers” in a way that it is formally similar to the neighbour-
hood semantics of modal logics. We deﬁne a notion of model structure as
a preordered groupoid, a semigroup in fact, with a covering system obey-
ing axioms that interact the covers with the ordering and the semigroup
structure.
This inﬁnitary ﬁrst-order logic of quantales is axiomatised by constructing
Lindenbaum algebras that are residuated semigroups and then embedding
these in quantales by means of the MacNeille completion and the theory
of quantic nuclei. We then show that any quantale can be represented as
an algebra of subsets of a model structure, and read oﬀthe Kripke-Joyal
semantics from this. The ﬁnal section of the paper makes a foray into the
world of quantal modal logic, giving in particular a structural modelling of
the logic of closure operators on quantales.

Posemigroups and Quantales
Given a poset ⟨S, ≤⟩, comprising a partial ordering ≤on a set S, we write
PX for the join (=least upper bound), and QX for the meet (=greatest
lower bound), of a set X ⊆S, when these bounds exist. A poset is complete
if every subset has a join, or equivalently if every subset has a meet.
A posemigroup S = ⟨S, ≤, •⟩has an associative binary operation • that
is monotone (i.e. order preserving) in each argument, meaning that x ≤z
1The idea goes back to J´onsson and Tarski. The ternary relation semantics is most
associated with the Routley-Meyer semantics of the (commutative) fusion connective in
relevant logic. See also [7].

implies x • y ≤z • y and y • x ≤y • z. A quantale is a complete poset with
an associative • in which the equations
(PX) • a
=
P
x∈X(x • a)
(2.1)
a • (PX)
=
P
x∈X(a • x)
(2.2)
hold for every set X ⊆S. These equations imply that • is monotone.
A posemigroup S is residuated if there are binary operations ⇒l and ⇒r
on S, called the left and right residuals of •, satisfying
x • a ≤b
iﬀ
x ≤a ⇒l b
(2.3)
a • x ≤b
iﬀ
x ≤a ⇒r b.
(2.4)
These two residual operations are identical precisely when • is commutative.
In a residuated semigroup, the equations (2.1) and (2.2) hold whenever the
joins they refer to exist. This is a well-known fact, and is really an instance
of the general categorical result that left adjoint functors preserve colimits:
here the map x 7→x • a is a functor on the poset category ⟨S, ≤⟩that is left
adjoint to b 7→a ⇒l b by (2.3), while x 7→a •x is left adjoint to b 7→a ⇒r b
by (2.4).
Thus a complete residuated posemigroup is a quantale. The converse is
also true: every quantale is residuated with a ⇒l b = P{x : x • a ≤b} and
a ⇒r b = P{x : a • x ≤b}.
Any residuated posemigroup can be embedded into a quantale by the
famous completion construction of MacNeille [12]. This is shown in Section
4 of [18], where it is inferred from a more abstract result, and in Chapter
8 of [21] in the commutative case. Here we give the details of the proof in
a way that emphasises its dependence on both residual operations when •
is not commutative. The construction uses the theory of closure operators:
a closure operator on a poset S is a function j : S →S that is monotone:
x ≤y implies jx ≤jy; inﬂationary: x ≤jx; and idempotent: jjx = jx. An
element x is j-closed if jx = x. If S is complete, then the set Sj of j-closed
elements is closed under meets QX, and so is complete under the same
partial ordering. The join operation Pj in Sj is given by PjX = j(PX).
Now if X is a subset of a poset S, let lX be the set of all lower bounds,
and uX the set of all upper bounds, of X in S. Put mX = luX. Then
m is a closure operator on the complete poset ⟨PS, ⊆⟩, where PS is the
powerset of S. Any set of the form lX is m-closed, including the set x↓=
l{x} = {y ∈S : y ≤x} for each x ∈S. So the set (PS)m of all m-closed
subsets of S is complete under the ordering ⊆, as explained above, with
QX = TX and PX = m(SX) in (PS)m, where X is any collection of
m-closed sets.
The function fm(x) = x ↓is an order-invariant injection
fm : ⟨S, ≤⟩→⟨(PS)m, ⊆⟩having the crucial property that it preserves
any joins and meets that exist in S (see [5, pp. 40–44] for a comprehensive
discussion of this MacNeille completion construction).
A quantic nucleus is a closure operator on a posemigroup that satisﬁes
jx • jy ≤j(x • y).
(2.5)

If j is a quantic nucleus on a quantale ⟨Q, ≤, •⟩, then the complete poset
⟨Qj, ≤⟩of j-closed elements is a quantale under the operation a •j b =
j(a • b) [17, Theorem 2.1]. Moreover Qj is closed under the residuals of •,
and indeed both a ⇒l b and a ⇒r b belong to Qj whenever b ∈Qj [20,
Prop. 3.1.2]. From this it can be shown that the residuals of •j on Qj are
just the restrictions of the residuals of • on Q to Qj.
Now from any semigroup ⟨S, •⟩we can construct a quantale ⟨PS, ⊆, •⟩
on the powerset of S by putting
X • Y = {x • y : x ∈X and y ∈Y }
for all X, Y ⊆S. In this quantale the join PX is the set-theoretic union
SX, and the residuals are given by
X ⇒l Y = {z ∈S : {z} • X ⊆Y }, X ⇒r Y = {z ∈S : X • {z} ⊆Y }.(2.6)
LEMMA 1. For any residuated semigroup ⟨S, ≤, •⟩, the MacNeille closure
operator mX = luX is a quantic nucleus on the quantale ⟨PS, ⊆, •⟩, and
so ⟨(PS)m, ⊆, •m⟩is a quantale. Moreover the injection fm : S →(PS)m
preserves • and its residuals.
Proof. We have to show that (luX)•(luY ) ⊆lu(X •Y ), so ﬁx any x ∈luX
and y ∈luY . Let z ∈u(X • Y ). We have to show x • y ≤z.
Now if y′ ∈Y , then for all x′ ∈X, x′ • y′ ≤z and hence x′ ≤y′ ⇒l z.
This shows that y′ ⇒l z ∈uX, so x ≤y′ ⇒l z as x ∈luX, hence x • y′ ≤z
and so y′ ≤x ⇒r z. Since that holds for all y′ ∈Y , x ⇒r z ∈uY , so
y ≤x ⇒r z, implying x • y ≤z as required. Thus (2.5) holds when j = m.
For preservation of • by fm, note that since x • y ∈(x↓)•(y↓) we get
(x • y)↓⊆m((x↓)•(y↓)). But (x↓) • (y↓) ⊆(x • y)↓, so m((x↓) • (y↓)) ⊆
m((x • y)↓) = (x • y)↓. Hence (x • y)↓= m((x↓) • (y↓)) = (x↓)•m(y↓) as
required.
Now the residuals of •m are just the restrictions of the residuals of •, so
these are given on (PS)m by (2.6). Preservation of ⇒l thus amounts to the
condition that z ≤x ⇒l y iﬀz • (x↓) ⊆(y↓), which follows readily by (2.3)
and monotonicity of •. Preservation of ⇒r follows similarly from (2.4).

COROLLARY 2. Every residuated posemigroup has an isomorphic embed-
ding into the residuated posemigroup of a quantale that preserves any exist-
ing joins and meets.

Logic
We assume familiarity with the syntactic apparatus of ﬁrst-order logic with
inﬁnite disjunctions and conjunctions. Sensitivity to the distinction between
large classes and sets (small classes) is required, since collections of formulas
may be large.

3.1
Formulas
Fix a denumerable list v0, . . . , vn, . . . of individual variables and a set of
predicate letters, with typical member P, that are k-ary for various k < ω.
These are used to deﬁne atomic formulas P(vn1, . . . , vnk). A preformula is
any expression generated from atomic formulas by using the binary connec-
tives &, →l, →r and the quantiﬁers ∃vn, ∀vn, and by allowing the formation
of the disjunction WΦ and conjunction VΦ of any set Φ of formulas. A
formula is a preformula that has only ﬁnitely many free variables. This
constraint is a standard convention in inﬁnitary logic, designed to avoid
dealing with expressions that have too many free variables to be convertible
into sentences by preﬁxing quantiﬁers [1, 4]. We conﬁne our attention to
formulas throughout.
The class of all formulas is large, so cannot be used in its entirety to build
a Lindenbaum algebra as a quotient set (the requisite equivalence classes
of formulas may themselves be large). The class sub ϕ of subformulas of a
formula ϕ is deﬁned in the usual way, e.g. if ϕ = WΦ, then sub ϕ = {ϕ} ∪
S
ψ∈Φsub ψ. Then if Ψ is any set of formulas, the class sub Ψ = S
ψ∈Ψsub ψ
of all subformulas of members of Ψ is a set.
We adopt the usual conventions for variable-substitution, writing ϕ(w/v)
for the formula obtained by substituting w for all free occurrences of v in a
suitable alphabetic variant of ϕ.
3.2
Quantal Models
These are structures A = ⟨Q, D, V ⟩with Q = ⟨Q, ≤, •⟩being a quantale,
D a non-empty set of individuals, and V a function assigning to each k-ary
predicate letter P a function V (P) : Dk →Q. To interpret variables in
the model we use D-valuations, which are sequences σ = ⟨σ0, . . . , σn, . . .⟩of
elements of D, the idea being that σ assigns value σn to variable vn. We
write σ(d/n) for the valuation obtained from σ by replacing σn by d. For
each formula ϕ we specify a value ∥ϕ∥A
σ ∈Q for each valuation σ. This is
deﬁned inductively on the formation of ϕ, as follows:
• ∥P(vn1, . . . , vnk)∥A
σ = V (P)(σn1, . . . , σnk)
• ∥ϕ&ψ∥A
σ = ∥ϕ∥A
σ • ∥ψ∥A
σ
• ∥ϕ →l ψ∥A
σ = ∥ϕ∥A
σ ⇒l ∥ψ∥A
σ ,
∥ϕ →r ψ∥A
σ = ∥ϕ∥A
σ ⇒r ∥ψ∥A
σ
• ∥WΦ∥A
σ = P
ϕ∈Φ∥ϕ∥A
σ
• ∥VΦ∥A
σ = Q
ϕ∈Φ∥ϕ∥A
σ
• ∥∃vnϕ∥A
σ = P
d∈D∥ϕ∥A
σ(d/n)
• ∥∀vnϕ∥A
σ = Q
d∈D∥ϕ∥A
σ(d/n).
We write ϕ |=A ψ if ∥ϕ∥A
σ ≤∥ψ∥A
σ for all D-valuations σ, and say that ϕ
semantically implies ψ over quantales, written ϕ |=q ψ, if ϕ |=A ψ for all
quantal models A.

Proof Theory
A sequent is an expression ϕ ⊢ψ with ϕ and ψ being formulas. Alterna-
tively, a sequent may be thought of as an ordered pair of formulas, with
the symbol ⊢denoting a class of sequents, i.e. a binary relation between
formulas.
Let ⊢q be the smallest class of sequents that includes all instances of the
axiom schemas
• ϕ ⊢ϕ;
• ϕ&(ψ&ρ) ⊢(ϕ&ψ)&ρ,
(ϕ&ψ)&ρ ⊢ϕ&(ψ&ρ);
• ϕ ⊢WΦ,
if ϕ ∈Φ;
• ϕ(w/v) ⊢∃vϕ;
• VΦ ⊢ϕ,
if ϕ ∈Φ;
• ∀ϕ ⊢ϕ(w/v);
• (ϕ →l ψ)&ϕ ⊢ψ,
ϕ&(ϕ →r ψ) ⊢ψ;
and is closed under the following rules:
• if ϕ ⊢ψ and ψ ⊢ρ, then ϕ ⊢ρ;
• if ϕ ⊢ψ, then ϕ&ρ ⊢ψ&ρ and ρ&ϕ ⊢ρ&ψ;
• if ϕ ⊢ψ for all ϕ ∈Φ, then WΦ ⊢ψ;
• if ϕ ⊢ψ, then ∃vϕ ⊢ψ provided v does not occur free in ψ.
• if ψ ⊢ϕ for all ϕ ∈Φ, then ψ ⊢VΦ;
• if ϕ ⊢ψ, then ϕ ⊢∀vψ provided v does not occur free in ϕ.
• if ϕ&ψ ⊢ρ, then ϕ ⊢ψ →l ρ and ψ ⊢ϕ →r ρ.
THEOREM 3 (Soundness). ϕ ⊢q ψ implies ϕ |=q ψ.
Proof. For any quantal model A, the relation |=A includes all instances
of the above axioms and is closed under the above rules, so it includes ⊢q.
Thus ϕ ⊢q ψ implies ϕ |=A ψ for all quantal models A.

3.4
Lindenbaum Models of Fragments
A fragment is a set F of formulas that includes all atomic formulas; is closed
under the binary connectives &, →l, →r, and the quantiﬁers ∃vn, ∀vn; and is
closed under subformulas and variable substitution. Any set Φ of formulas
can be enlarged to a fragment: deﬁne F0 by adding all atomic formulas
to Φ, and then inductively deﬁne Fn+1 by closing Fn under the binary
connectives and the quantiﬁers, and then closing under subformulas and

A Kripke-Joyal Semantics for Noncommutative Logic in Quantales
215
variable-substitution. Then F = S
n<ωFn is the smallest fragment including
Φ.
Deﬁnition of the Lindenbaum quantal model AF of a fragment begins
with the standard construction. Let ⊢be a relation satisfying all the above
axioms and rules. The condition “ϕ ⊢ψ and ψ ⊢ϕ” gives an equivalence
relation on F. Let |ϕ| be the equivalence class of ϕ ∈F and SF = {|ϕ| :
ϕ ∈F}. Put |ϕ| ≤|ψ| iﬀϕ ⊢ψ; |ϕ| • |ψ| = |ϕ&ψ|, |ϕ| ⇒l |ψ| = |ϕ →l ψ|
and |ϕ| ⇒r |ψ| = |ϕ →r ψ|. The axioms and rules ensure that this yields a
well-deﬁned residuated posemigroup SF on SF in which
|∃vnϕ| = P
p<ω|ϕ(vp/vn)|,
|∀vnϕ| = Q
p<ω|ϕ(vp/vn)|
(3.1)
|WΦ| = P
ϕ∈Φ|ϕ|,
when WΦ ∈F
(3.2)
|VΦ| = Q
ϕ∈Φ|ϕ|
when VΦ ∈F.
(3.3)
The proof of (3.1) is as for ﬁnitary ﬁrst-order logic (e.g. [2, Lemma 3.4.1]),
and depends on the fact that a formula has ﬁnitely many free variables.
Now put AF = ⟨QF, D, V ⟩, where QF is the quantale obtained from SF
by Corollary 2 and having an embedding f : SF →QF; D is the set of all
variables vn; and V (P)(vn1, . . . , vnk) = f|P(vn1, . . . , vnk)|. Then if σ is the
D-valuation with σn = vn, we get
∥P(vn1, . . . , vnk)∥AF
σ
= f|P(vn1, . . . , vnk)|.
We then extend this to show inductively that
∥ϕ∥AF
σ
= f|ϕ| for all ϕ ∈F.
(3.4)
This uses the the deﬁnition of ∥ϕ∥A
σ , results (3.1)–(3.3), the fact that f
preserves the residuated posemigroup operations and any joins and meets
existing in SF; and the general substitutional result that ∥ϕ(vp/vn)∥A
σ =
∥ϕ∥A
σ(σp/n) (which holds of any σ in any model A).
THEOREM 4 (Completeness). ϕ |=q ψ implies ϕ ⊢q ψ.
Proof. Let ϕ |=q ψ, and take a fragment F containing ϕ and ψ. Construct
AFas above using the relation ⊢q to deﬁne SF. Then ϕ |=AF ψ, so ∥ϕ∥σ ≤
∥ψ∥σ in AF where σn = vn. Hence |ϕ| ≤|ψ| by (3.4) and the fact that f is
order-invariant, so ϕ ⊢q ψ.

Covers and Model Structures
We now work with structures S = ⟨S, ⊳, ·, Cov⟩, where ⊳is a preorder (i.e.
reﬂexive and transitive relation); · is an associative operation that is ⊳-
monotone in each argument; and Cov is a function assigning to each x ∈S
a collection Cov(x) of subsets of S, called the covers of x, or x-covers.
For X, Y ⊆S, put X · Y = {x · y : x ∈X and y ∈Y }, x · Y = {x} · Y
and X · y = X · {y}. Let [X) = {y ∈S : (∃x ∈X)x ⊳y} and [x) = [{x}) =
{y : x ⊳y}. X is increasing if [X) ⊆X, meaning that if x ∈X and x ⊳y,

216
Robert Goldblatt
then y ∈X.2 In general, [X) is the smallest increasing superset of X. We
write X ⊳Y , and say that Y reﬁnes X, and that X is reﬁned by Y , if
(∀y ∈Y )(∃x ∈X)x ⊳y. Thus X ⊳Y iﬀY ⊆[X). A set X is cover-closed
if, for all x ∈S, (∃C ∈Cov(x))(C ⊆X) implies x ∈X. A c-ﬁlter is a set
that is increasing and cover-closed.
We call S a model structure3 if the following axioms hold for all x ∈S:
cov1: there exists an x-cover C ⊆[x);
cov2: if C ∈Cov(x) and for all y ∈C, Cy ∈Cov(y), then S
y∈CCy ∈
Cov(x).
cov3: if x ⊳y, then every x-cover can be reﬁned to a y-cover:
(∀C ∈Cov(x))(∃B ∈Cov(y))C ⊳B.
cov4: if C ∈Cov(x) and B ∈Cov(y), then C · B can be reﬁned to a x · y-
cover.
cov5: if there exists an x-cover reﬁning X · Y , then there exist x′, y′ with
x′ · y′ ⊳x; an x′-cover X′ ⊆X; and a y′-cover Y ′ ⊆Y .
THEOREM 5. If S is a model structure, then QS = ⟨SS, ⊆, •⟩is a quan-
tale, where SS is the set of all c-ﬁlters of S and X • Y = [X · Y ). Joins
in QS are given by PX = {x : (∃C ∈Cov(x))C ⊆SX} for all X ⊆SS.
The residuals of • are given by X ⇒l Y = {z ∈S : z · X ⊆Y } and
X ⇒r Y = {z ∈S : X · z ⊆Y }.
Proof. This could be shown by direct set-theoretic reasoning, but more
insight into the role of the (cov)-axioms is gained by constructing QS as
the quantale of closed elements of a quantic nucleus. Put Q⊳= ⟨S⊳, ⊆, •⟩
where S⊳is the set of ⊳-increasing subsets of S and X • Y = [X · Y ). It
is readily seen that Q⊳is a quantale in which the join of X ⊆S⊳is the
set-union SX (and the meet is TX).
Note that the deﬁnition of Q⊳is
independent of Cov.
Now deﬁne a ⊆-monotonic function jCov on S⊳by jCovX = {x ∈S :
(∃C ∈Cov(x))C ⊆X}. The axioms (cov1)–(cov4) then ensure that jCov is
a quantic nucleus on Q⊳, as follows.
First, (cov3) ensures that jCovX is increasing when X is, for if x ∈jCovX
and x ⊳y, then there exists C ∈Cov(x) with C ⊆X, hence by (cov3) there
exists B ∈Cov(y) with B ⊆[C) ⊆[X) = X, implying y ∈jCovX.
Next, (cov1) ensures that jCov is inﬂationary, for if x ∈X ∈S⊳, then by
(cov1) there exists C ∈Cov(x) with C ⊆[x) ⊆X, implying x ∈jCovX.
Thus X ⊆jCovX.
2Some treatments of Kripke-Joyal semantics in posets for intuitionistic logic use de-
creasing sets rather than increasing ones, e.g.
[3].
Here we follow the conventions of
Kripke’s original model theory, as well as of those using preordered groupoids to model
other substructural logics [19, 18, 6, 7]. Formally, the distinction is no more than that
between a preorder and its converse.
3Modal logicians would tend to call this a “frame”, but we avoid this term since it
has a diﬀerent meaning in locale theory.

A Kripke-Joyal Semantics for Noncommutative Logic in Quantales
217
(cov2) ensures that jCovjCovX ⊆jCovX, for if there exists C ∈Cov(x)
with C ⊆jCovX, then for all y ∈C there exists Cy ∈Cov(y) with Cy ⊆X.
Then by (cov2), S
y∈Y Cy is an x-cover included in X, showing x ∈jCovX.
Finally, (cov4) and (cov3) ensure that jCov satisﬁes (2.5). For if z ∈
(jCovX) • (jCovY ), then x · y ⊳z for some x, y such that there is an x-cover
C ⊆X and a y-cover B ⊆Y . By (cov4) there is some x·y-cover A ⊆[C ·B),
and then by (cov3) there is a z-cover A′ ⊆[A) ⊆[C · B) ⊆[X · Y ) = X • Y ,
showing that z ∈jCov(X • Y ). Hence (jCovX) • (jCovY ) ⊆jCov(X • Y ).
Now for X ∈S⊳we have jCovX = X iﬀjCovX ⊆X iﬀX is cover-closed.
So the set of jCov-closed elements of S⊳is just the set SS of c-ﬁlters of S.
Thus by the theory explained in Section 2, QS = ⟨SS, ⊆, •jCov⟩is a quantale
is which PX = jCov
SX, as required by the statement of this Theorem. But
(cov5) ensures that if X and Y are cover-closed, then so is X •Y , for if there
exists C ∈Cov(x) with C ⊆X • Y , then X · Y ⊳C, so taking x′, y′, X′, Y ′
as given by (cov5) we get x′ ∈X as X is cover-closed, and likewise y′ ∈Y ,
hence x ∈[X · Y ) as required because x′ · y′ ⊳x. Thus if X, Y are c-ﬁlters,
then so is X • Y , implying X •jCov Y = jCov(X • Y ) = X • Y . So •jCov is
just • on SS.
To show the residuals in QS are as stated, let W = {z : z · X ⊆Y }.
Then in general Z · X ⊆Y iﬀZ ⊆W, so if Y is increasing, Z • X ⊆Y iﬀ
Z ⊆W. But if Y is increasing then so is W by ⊳-monotonicity of ·. Thus
if X, Y ∈S⊳, then since W ∈S⊳we must have W = (X ⇒l Y ) in Q⊳. But
the left residual of •jCov in QS is just the restriction of the left residual of
• in Q⊳to SS, so if X, Y ∈SS, then W = (X ⇒l Y ) in QS. Similarly for
X ⇒r Y .
■
The covering concept comes of course from topology, where an open cover
of a set x is any collection C of open sets whose union includes x. A property
holds locally of x if it holds of all members of some cover of x. For example,
a function is locally constant on x if it is constant on each member of some
x-cover. If we take S to be the set of all open subsets of some topological
space and put x ⊳y iﬀy ⊆x, x · y = x ∩y and C ∈Cov(x) iﬀx ⊆SC,
then we obtain a model structure (in which “reﬁnes” has its usual meaning
for topological covers). Indeed this construction works in any quantale, as
we now show.
THEOREM 6. Every quantale Q is isomorphic to the quantale QS of some
model structure S.
Proof. Let Q = ⟨Q, ≤, •⟩. Deﬁne S = ⟨S, ⊳, ·, Cov⟩by putting S = Q; x⊳y
iﬀy ≤x; x · y = x • y; and C ∈Cov(x) iﬀx ≤PC for all C ⊆Q. Then ⊳
is a preorder and · is associative and ⊳-monotone. Moreover, [x) = (x↓).
Thus a set X is increasing in S iﬀit is ≤-decreasing in Q, i.e. x ∈X
implies (x↓) ⊆X. In particular, x↓is increasing, and is also cover-closed,
for if C ∈Cov(y) and C ⊆(x↓), then y ≤PC ≤x, hence y ∈(x↓).
Moreover, if X is any c-ﬁlter and we put x = PX, then X ∈Cov(x) and
so x ∈X by cover-closure, hence X = (x↓) as X is ≤-decreasing.

Thus the map x 7→(x↓) is a bijection between Q and the set SS of
c-ﬁlters of S. This map is order-invariant: x ≤y iﬀ(x↓) ⊆(y↓). But
it is readily seen that (x • y)↓= [(x↓) · (y↓)) so altogether the map is an
isomorphism between Q and the quantale QS of the previous Theorem. It
remains to show S is a model structure.
(cov1): Any C with x ∈C ⊆[x) will do.
(cov2): If x ≤PC, and (∀y ∈C)(y ≤PCy), then x ≤P
y∈C(PCy) =
P(S
y∈CCy).
(cov3): If C ∈Cov(x) and x ⊳y, then y ≤x ≤PC, so just take B = C.
(cov4): If C ∈Cov(x) and B ∈Cov(y), then x · y ≤(PC) · (PB) =
P(C · B), with the equality following from the distributive laws (2.1) and
(2.2). Thus C · B is itself an x · y-cover.
(cov5): Suppose there is an x-cover C ⊆[X·Y ). Put X′ = {a ∈X : (∃b ∈
Y )(∃c ∈C)a · b ⊳c} ⊆X and Y ′ = {b ∈Y : (∃a ∈X)(∃c ∈C)a · b ⊳c} ⊆Y .
Let x′ = PX′ and y′ = PY ′, so that X′ ∈Cov(x′) and Y ′ ∈Cov(y′). It
remains to show x′ · y′ ⊳x. Now if c ∈C, then a · b ⊳c for some a ∈X and
b ∈Y . Then a ∈X′ and b ∈Y ′, so c ≤a·b ≤x′·y′. Hence x ≤PC ≤x′·y′,
as required.
■
The axioms (cov1)–(cov5) are almost minimal requirements for QS to be
a quantale in Theorem 5. (cov5) could be weakened as it is only needed
when X and Y are c-ﬁlters. In that case we could add the requirement
that every cover is an increasing set, since both Theorems 5 and 6 would
hold under this requirement. As it stands, the model structure deﬁned in
Theorem 6 satisﬁes several other strengthenings and additional conditions.
It has [x) ∈Cov(x) and {x} ∈Cov(x), each of which implies (cov1). For
(cov3) it has the stronger property that if x ⊳y, then every x-cover is a
y-cover. For (cov4) it has the conclusion that C · B is an x · y cover when
C ∈Cov(x) and B ∈Cov(y). It even has the property that Cov(x) is closed
under supersets. But it does not have the property that every x-cover is
a subset of [x), which is a basic assumption in the deﬁnition of coverings
on posets in locale theory [10, 3] and is fundamental to the categorical
view of coverings in a Grothendieck topology on a category. In the S of
Theorem 6, this property would require that an x-cover have x = PC,
rather than x ≤PC. This makes (cov3) problematic, although the other
(cov)-axioms still hold. If Q is a locale, then (cov3) does hold in this case,
for if y ≤x = PC, then the subset {y ⊓c : c ∈C} of [y) is a reﬁnement
of C whose join is y, by the distribution of the lattice meet ⊓over P. But
that argument is not available in a general quantale.

Kripke-Joyal Semantics
A structural model for the language of Section 3 has the form M = ⟨S, D, V ⟩,
where S is a model structure; D is a set of individuals; and for each k-ary
predicate letter P, V (P) is a function assigning a c-ﬁlter of S to each k-
tuple of elements of D. In other words, V (P) : Dk →SS, where SS is
the set of all c-ﬁlters of S. From such an M we immediately obtain the

A Kripke-Joyal Semantics for Noncommutative Logic in Quantales
219
quantal model AM = ⟨QS, D, V ⟩, where QS = ⟨SS, ⊆, •⟩is the quantale
of Theorem 5. We deﬁne ϕ |=M ψ to mean that ϕ |=AM ψ. Also we write
∥ϕ∥M
σ
for the value ∥ϕ∥AM
σ
given by the general deﬁnition of ∥ϕ∥A
σ from
Section 3. Thus ∥ϕ∥M
σ
is a c-ﬁlter, and
ϕ |=M ψ
iﬀ
∥ϕ∥M
σ
⊆∥ψ∥M
σ
for all D-valuations σ.
(5.1)
In the converse direction, from any quantal model A = ⟨Q, D, V ⟩we obtain
the structural model MA = ⟨S, D, V A⟩, where S is the model structure of
Theorem 6 for which there is an isomorphism of quantales f : Q ∼= QS, and
V M(P) = f ◦V (P) : Dk →SS.
Since the isomorphism f preserves all the operations involved in the def-
inition of ∥ϕ∥A
σ , an inductive proof then shows that in general f ◦∥ϕ∥A
σ =
∥ϕ∥MA
σ
, and so ∥ϕ∥A
σ ≤∥ψ∥A
σ iﬀ∥ϕ∥MA
σ
⊆∥ψ∥MA
σ
. Hence
ϕ |=A ψ
iﬀ
ϕ |=MA ψ.
(5.2)
THEOREM 7 (Completeness for Structural Models). For all formulas ϕ
and ψ the following are equivalent:
(1) ϕ ⊢q ψ.
(2) ϕ |=M ψ for all structural models M.
Proof.
(1) implies (2): by the Soundness Theorem 3, ϕ ⊢q ψ implies
ϕ |=AM ψ. (2) implies (1): if ϕ ̸⊢q ψ, then by the Completeness Theorem
4, ϕ ̸|=A ψ for some quantal model A. But then ϕ ̸|=MA ψ by (5.2).
■
In a model structure M = ⟨S, ⊳, ·, Cov, D, V ⟩, a satisfaction relation can
be deﬁned by using the notation
M, x |= ϕ[σ]
to mean that x ∈∥ϕ∥M
σ . This can be read “ϕ is true/satisﬁed in M at x
under σ”. Thus (5.1) becomes
ϕ |=M ψ
iﬀ
for all x and σ, M, x |= ϕ[σ] implies M, x |= ψ[σ].
A purely model theoretic description of this satisfaction relation in a struc-
tural model can be derived by applying the description of the quantale op-
erations of QS given in Theorem 5 to the general deﬁnition of ∥ϕ∥A
σ . This
is given below (with the symbol M suppressed as it is constant through-
out). The cases of W, V and ∃are just like the corresponding clauses in the
Kripke-Joyal semantics of models in sheaf categories [11, Theorem VI.7.1].

x |= P(vn1, . . . , vnk)[σ]
iﬀ
x ∈V (P)(σn1, . . . , σnk).
x |= ϕ&ψ[σ]
iﬀ
for some y and z such that y · z ⊳x,
y |= ϕ[σ] and z |= ψ[σ].
x |= ϕ →l ψ[σ]
iﬀ
y |= ϕ[σ] implies x · y |= ψ[σ].
x |= ϕ →r ψ[σ]
iﬀ
y |= ϕ[σ] implies y · x |= ψ[σ].
x |= WΦ[σ]
iﬀ
there is an x-cover C such that for all z ∈C,
z |= ϕ[σ] for some ϕ ∈Φ.
x |= VΦ[σ]
iﬀ
x |= ϕ[σ] for all ϕ ∈Φ.
x |= ∃vnϕ[σ]
iﬀ
there is an x-cover C such that for all z ∈C,
z |= ϕ[σ(d/n)] for some d ∈D.
x |= ∀vnϕ[σ]
iﬀ
x |= ϕ[σ(d/n)] for all d ∈D.
In place of the last clause, the sheaf semantics (and Kripke’s intuitionistic
semantics) typically has
x |= ∀vnϕ[σ]
iﬀ
x ⊳y implies y |= ϕ[σ(d/n)] for all d ∈D.
But this follows from the last clause because the c-ﬁlter ∥ϕ[σ(d/n)]∥M
σ
is
⊳-increasing. The semantics of →l is sometimes given in the form
x |= ϕ →l ψ[σ]
iﬀ
(x · y ⊳z and y |= ϕ[σ]) implies z |= ψ[σ],
but this follows from the above because ∥ψ∥M
σ
is ⊳-increasing. Similarly for
ϕ →r ψ.
If we take the classical disjunction of Φ to be a formula that is satisﬁed at
x precisely when some member of Φ is satisﬁed at x, then the above criterion
for x |= WΦ is that the classical disjunction of Φ is locally satisﬁed at x, i.e.
satisﬁed throughout some cover of x. Similarly, the criterion for x |= ∃vnϕ
is that the classical existential quantiﬁcation of ϕ is locally satisﬁed at x.
6
Modalities
We now take a few steps in the direction of modal logic over quantales.
A modal operator on a quantal or other poset will be taken to be any
unary function j that is monotone.
This can be used to give algebraic
semantics to a new unary connective (modality) ∇by deﬁning ∥∇ϕ∥=
j∥ϕ∥. Structurally ∇can be interpreted by adding to the deﬁnition of a
model structure S a new binary relation ≺on S, and requiring that in a
model based on S,
M, x |= ∇ϕ[σ]
iﬀ
for some y, x ≺y and M, y |= ϕ[σ].
(6.1)
The relation ≺induces the modal operator j≺on ⟨PS, ⊆⟩having
j≺X = {x ∈S : ∃y(x ≺y ∈X)}.
(6.2)
Then the deﬁnition ∥∇ϕ∥M
σ
= j≺∥ϕ∥M
σ
ensures that (6.1) holds. But we
also want to ensure that j≺X is a c-ﬁlter whenever X is.
This can be

A Kripke-Joyal Semantics for Noncommutative Logic in Quantales
221
achieved by requiring that a model structure satisﬁes the following two
conditions
if x ⊳y and x ≺z, then for some w, z ⊳w and y ≺w.
(6.3)
cov7: if there exists an x-cover included in j≺X, then there exists
a y with x ≺y, and a y-cover included in X.
(6.3) states that (⊲◦≺) ⊆(≺◦⊲), where ⊲is the converse of ⊳, and suﬃces
to make j≺X ⊳-increasing if X is. (cov7) makes j≺X cover-closed if X is.
Then the quantale QS of c-ﬁlters is closed under j≺.
In the opposite direction, starting with a modal operator j on a quantale
Q, deﬁne a relation ≺j on the structure S of Theorem 6 having Q ∼= QS,
by putting x ≺j y iﬀx ≤jy. This in turn induces the operator j≺j on QS.
THEOREM 8. ≺j satisﬁes (6.3) and (cov7), and the isomorphism x 7→(x↓)
from Q to QS preserves the operators j and j≺j .
Proof. For (6.3), if x ⊳y and x ≺j z, then y ≤x ≤jz, so y ≺j z, hence
(6.3) holds in the strong form that we can take w = z.
For (cov7), suppose there exists C ∈Cov(x) with C ⊆j≺j X. Hence
x ≤PC. Let B = {z ∈X : ∃c ∈C(c ≺j z)}, and put y = PB. Then
B ∈Cov(y) and B ⊆X, so it remains to show x ≺j y. But if c ∈C, then
c ∈j≺j X, so there exists z with c ≺j z ∈X. Then c ≤jz and z ∈B,
so z ≤y, hence jz ≤jy as j is monotone, and thus c ≤jy. Therefore
x ≤PC ≤jy, implying x ≺j y.
Preservation of the operators requires that (jx)↓= j≺j (x↓). But if z ∈
(jx)↓, then z ≺j x ∈(x↓), so z ∈j≺j (x↓) by (6.2). And if z ∈j≺j (x↓), then
z ≺j y ≤x for some y, so z ≤jy ≤jx, giving z ∈(jx)↓.
■
We can now consider correspondences between properties of j and prop-
erties of ≺in a manner familiar from modal logic. If ≺is reﬂexive, then
j≺is inﬂationary, and if ≺is transitive, then j≺j≺X ⊆j≺X. Hence if ≺
is a preorder, j≺is a closure operator (inﬂationary and idempotent). Con-
versely, if j is an inﬂationary modal operator on a quantale, then ≺j is
reﬂexive, and if j ◦j ≤j (i.e. ∀x(jjx ≤jx)), then ≺j is transitive. Thus
a closure operator on a quantale can be represented as the oper-
ator j≺induced on the quantale of c-ﬁlters of a model structure
by a preorder relation ≺.
Recall from (2.5) that a quantic nucleus is a closure operator satisfying
jx • jy ≤j(x • y). For j≺to satisfy (2.5) it suﬃces that
if x · y ⊳z, x ≺x′ and y ≺y′, then ∃z′(z ≺z′ and x′ · y′ ⊳z′).
(6.4)
Conversely, if j is a quantic nucleus, then (6.4) holds in the strong form
that we can replace its conclusion by x′ · y′ ⊳z. For if z ≤x • y, x ≤jx′

222
Robert Goldblatt
and y ≤jy′, then z ≤jx′ • jy′ ≤j(x′ • y′). So any quantic nucleus can
be represented as the operator induced by a preorder satisfying this strong
form of (6.4).
To axiomatise the logic characterised by the class of quantal models with
a modality, we just add the rule
ϕ ⊢ψ implies ∇ϕ ⊢∇ψ
to the proof theory of Section 3.3. Then putting j|ϕ| = |∇ϕ| gives a well-
deﬁned modal operator on the Lindenbaum posemigroup SF of a fragment
as in Section 3.4. Viewing SF as a subalgebra of the quantale QF, we can
lift j to an operator j+ on QF by putting
j+x = P{ja ∈SF : a ≤x}.
j+ agrees with j when restricted to SF, and is monotone so can be repre-
sented as the operator induced by ≺j+.
If the axiom ϕ ⊢∇ϕ is added, then j is inﬂationary, hence so is j+ (proof:
x = P{a ∈SF : a ≤x} ≤P{ja : a ≤x}). The axiom ∇∇ϕ ⊢∇ϕ enforces
j ◦j ≤j, but this appears only to lift to j+ if j+ preserves joins, yielding
j+j+x = P{jja : a ≤x}. On the other hand the nucleus condition (2.5)
does lift to j+, as shown by the following calculation, in which a, b, c ∈SF:
X
a≤x
ja

•
X
b≤y
jb

=
X
a≤x,b≤y
(ja • jb) ≤
X
a≤x,b≤y
j(a • b) ≤
X
c≤x•y
jc.
Here the equality is given by the quantale distribution laws (2.1), (2.2), the
ﬁrst inequality by (2.5) for j, and the second by a • b ≤x • y.
To give a completeness theorem for the logic of closure operators on
quantales, a diﬀerent lifting of j to QF can be used, namely
j#x = Q{ja : a ∈SF and x ≤ja}.
Interestingly, this j# is a closure operator for any j whatsoever, but its
restriction to SF agrees with j (equivalently, the embedding of SF into QF
preserves j and j#) precisely when j itself is a closure operator, facts that
the reader may like to verify.
On the other hand it does not appear that (2.5) lifts to j# in general, so
an axiomatisation of the modal logic of quantic nuclei on quantales awaits
further investigation.

Conclusion and Further Work
The aim of this paper has been to extend the idea of Kripke-Joyal seman-
tics to a generalisation of the intuitionistic context, and a minimal syntax
has been used for this purpose.
There are many possible additions and
extensions that could be considered, and further questions that suggest
themselves. On the syntactic side we have not considered the modelling of

A Kripke-Joyal Semantics for Noncommutative Logic in Quantales
223
individual constants, function symbols, the equality predicate, or true and
false propositional constants ⊤and ⊥(although for the latter we could use
W∅and V∅). Semantically we used a kind of “constant domain” model,
with a single set D forming the range of quantiﬁable variables. It may be of
interest to explore the variable-domain approach of Kripke’s intuitionistic
models, in which each element x of a model structure has its own domain
Dx that is used in evaluating quantiﬁers at x.
Proof-theoretically we used simple sequents with a single formula on each
side of the symbol ⊢, so there is scope for discussion of something more like
the usual Gentzen calculi.
There are additional axioms required for the
various kinds of quantale that have been considered. It is often assumed
that a quantale is unital, i.e. there is an identity element for •, and this
requires a new propositional constant E, and a distinguished c-ﬁlter in model
structures to serve as ∥E∥M and be the identity element in QS. Then there
are quantales that are right-sided (ϕ&⊤⊢ϕ), left-sided (⊤&ϕ ⊢ϕ), and
idempotent (ϕ&ϕ ⊣⊢ϕ). The combination of axioms ϕ&ψ ⊢ϕ, ϕ&ψ ⊢ψ
and ϕ ⊢ϕ&ϕ force a • b to be the meet of a and b, hence ∥ϕ&ψ∥M =
∥ϕ∥M ∩∥ψ∥M = ∥ϕ ∧ψ∥M.
The involutary quantales have an involution a∗that preserves joins and
reverses the arguments of •, and amongst these the Hilbert quantales have
an orthocomplement a⊥that obeys De Morgan’s laws in relation to W and
V. The enhancement of our model structures to interpret unary connectives
corresponding to a∗and a⊥is a natural topic for investigation.
As to modal logic, a quantic nucleus j seems rather schizophrenic as a
modal operator. Its properties as a closure operator suggest it should model
a “diamond” modality with the bounded-existential modelling condition of
(6.1), as we have done here.
But in locales the nucleus property (2.5)
implies that j(a • b) is the lattice meet of ja and jb, which is a property
more reminiscent of the “box” modalities that have the bounded-universal
semantics
M, x |= ∇ϕ[σ]
iﬀ
for all y, x ≺y implies M, x |= ϕ[σ].
(7.1)
Indeed in [8] we gave a Kripke semantics for the ﬁnitary modal logic of nuclei
on locales, using this kind of semantics. So there is more to be explored
here, including the general study of modalities fulﬁlling (7.1), regardless of
whether they interpret quantic nuclei.
There are intimate connections between cover systems and quantic nuclei.
From any preordered semigroup ⟨S, ⊳, ·⟩we obtain a quantale ⟨S⊳, ⊆, •⟩in
which S⊳is the set of ⊳-increasing subsets, X • Y = [X · Y ), and joins are
set-unions. We saw in the proof of Theorem 5 that from any system Cov on
S satisfying (cov1)–(cov4) we get a quantic nucleus jCov on S⊳by putting
jCov(X) = {x ∈S : (∃C ∈Cov(x))C ⊆X}. But conversely, from any
quantic nucleus j on S⊳we get a system Cov j satisfying (cov1)–(cov4) by
putting Cov j(x) = {C ∈S⊳: x ∈j(C)}. Then jCov j = j. If Cov(x) is
always a subset of S⊳closed under supersets in S⊳(as indeed Cov j(x) is),

224
Robert Goldblatt
then Cov jCov = Cov. These relationships, and the general theory of cover
systems for quantales, warrant further investigation.
Finally we raise the question of the separate study of quantal geometric
formulas, which are those formed from atomic ones using only &, W and
∃. It would be of interest to axiomatise the class of sequents of geometric
formulas that are valid in quantal models in the sense of (5.1). Our com-
pleteness method depended on the the presence of the residuals ⇒l and
⇒r in a Lindenbaum posemigroup SF to construct the quantale QF by the
method of Corollary 2. It is not clear that the approach would work for
Lindenbaum algebras generated by a language without →l and →r. It may
be necessary to use more general sequents of lists of formulas to achieve
this. An alternative approach to completeness might be to use the standard
Henkin method to build “canonical” models whose points are sets of formu-
las with syntactic closure properties that mimic those of the “truth sets”
{ϕ : A, x |= ϕ[σ]} deﬁned by points in models under valuations. Of course
the construction of such canonical models would be of interest in general,
and not just for geometric formulas.
