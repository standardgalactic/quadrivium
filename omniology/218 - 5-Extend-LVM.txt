To extend filesystem of a Linux VM using LVM 
 
Go to your virtualization product (VMWare or Oracle Virtual Box) 
 
Increase the disk space to desired number and then click ok  
 
Now go to your Linux VM 
 
Reboot the VM to have the system re-scan the newly added disk Or  
 
cd /sys/class/scsi_disk/2:0:0:0 
 
echo '1' > device/rescan 
 
 
fdisk –l  
 
(To make sure the disk is increased) 
 
 
Create a new partition  
o 
fdisk /dev/sdc 
 
 
o 
n 
(for new partition) 
o 
p 
(for primary partition) 
o 
2 
(partition number, 2 or the new partition) 
o 
Enter 
o 
Enter 
o 
t 
(Label the new partition) 
o 
3 
(Pick default value) 
o 
8e 
(This will make the filesystem as LVM) 
o 
w 
(Write) 
o 
# reboot or init 6 
 
Note: 
The above procedure will create /dev/sdc2 partition 
 
 
Extend the LVM group 
o 
pvdisplay 
(To see which group associated with which disk) 
o 
pvs 
 
(Info about physical volumes 
o 
vgdisplay oracle_vg  (oracle_vg is the group name or you can simply run vgdisplay) 
On vgdisplay you will notice Free PE / Size at the bottom 
 
o 
pvcreate /dev/sdc2 
(Initialize partition for use by LVM) 
o 
vgextend oracle_vg /dev/sdc2 
(# = whichever partition was created above) 
o 
Run vgdisplay oracle_vg 
check (Free PE / Size).  The second column is the right column as free.  If it is in G convert 
that into M.  e.g. 1G = 1024M 
o 
lvextend –L+1024M /dev/mapper/oracle_vg-oracle_lv 
o 
resize2fs /dev/mapper/oracle_vg-oracle_lv 
o 
OR 
o 
xfs_growfs /dev/mapper/oracle_vg-oracle_lv
