•• INTRODUCTION 
Welcome 
Back by popular demand, Colin Smith and AI Ward unveil another feast of Photoshop delights. 
After the first Photoshop Most Wanted book we were deluged with feedback from readers wanting more: more 
effects so realistic you can almost touch them, more insider knowledge on using Actions and Layer Styles, and more 
of the inventive designs that have made AI and Colin such respected members of the Photoshop community. 
So this is it: a book jam-packed with great effects and cool design tips. You'll learn how to create a whole range of 
textures from industrial metal to the natural world, you'll discover how to use Masks, Gradients and Filters, and you'll 
be inspired by the amazing text effects. 
The book looks at some of Photoshop most sophisticated effects including how to make authentic-looking 3D objects, 
as well as examining one of Photos hop's hidden gems -the 3D engine. 
We'll also look at the best ways to use Photoshop for the Web, and clever transparency effects. We end the book 
with two collaborative design projects. We had a lot of positive feedback about the design projects in the first Most 
Wanted book. and this time Colin boarded planes and flew to Montana to work with AI on some more 
groundbreaking designs. 
As an added extra this book comes complete with a CD, on which you'll find a wealth of goodies. including source 
files, Actions and Layer Styles from AI, video tutorials from Colin. as well as some exciting bonus tutorials. So, take 
the book in hand, boot up your computer and prepare for some Photoshop fun! 
Conventions 
We've tried to keep this book as clear and easy to follow as possible, so we've only used a few layout styles: 
• 
When you come across an important word or phrase, it will be in bold type. 
• 
We'll use a different font to emphasize phrases that appear on the 'screen,' code. fil enames, what to 
hit on the KEYBOARD, and hyperlinks (www.friendsofed.com) 
• 
Menu commands are written in the form Menu > Sub-menu > Sub-menu. 
• 
When there's some information we think is really important, we'll highlight it like this: 
This is very important stuff- make sure you're 
paying attention!

Chapter 1 
e alwork"ng 
Generating metal effects in Photoshop has always been very 
high on the cool list and remains one of the most popular 
requests that I receive. In truth there are infinite variations of 
metal that could be covered. 
For this chapter I've chosen my favorite metal effects, and later 
in the book you'll see Colin unveil his own personal preferences 
- if you're familiar with the format, then you know that's part 
of the premise of the Photoshop Most Wanted titles: two 
designers approaching design from their separate points of 
view, and meeting somewhere in the middle. 
Another note before I begin. In one of these metal tutorials. I 
use type-shaped objects. The process for achieving these effects 
can be applied to objects other than type, so don't focus solely 
on the shape to which the effect is applied. but rather the 
process used in achieving the effect. This approach should be 
followed throughout the book. You're not trying to duplicate 
every nuance in the examples presented, but to learn how to 
achieve the effect in your own designs. 
That being said, let's apply logs to the hearth, fire up the forge, 
and melt some ore!

21. Go ahead and click on the eye for the Background 
layer to make it visible again. Note how using the 
blurred channel for the lighting effects has 
enhanced not only the reflection on the object, 
but imposed bevels around the edges.

The desired effect we are trying to achieve is to create 
a drop shadow. but one that matches the direction of 
the lighting. In this instance the light is hitting the object 
from a 90-degree angle, but appears to be relatively 
close to the top surface of the object. The layer Style 
drop shadow doesn't work in this instance. Even now, 
the shadow can be tweaked to better fit the object's 
shape and lighting. 
38. Go to Edit > Transform > Distort. Move the 
Transform points in such a way that the shadow 
opposes the light source. This may require some 
careful scrutiny. When satisfied, click the Commit 
Transform icon in the options bar. This is found on 
the right side of the bar, appearing as a 
checkmark. 
39. In the layers palette, create a new copy of the 
Chrome-1 layer.

42. CrRL!CMo-click the shape layer again

43. To add to the realism, we're going to add some 
tarnish to the metal surface. Select the Polygonal 
Lasso tool. In the options bar, set the following 
attributes for the tool: 
The 
tarnish 
will 
be 
applied 
to 
the 
lower 
portion of the shape, 
so 
the upper portion

the shape is somewhat 3-dimensional, so the deleted 
selection needs to reflect that. 
Here's the remaining selection:

of the layer stack. Hit the D key to reset the 
default

2: Springs 
Photo realistic metal objects are actually fairly easy to 
create in Photoshop once you have a handle on creating 
the shape and lighting the object. As seen in the first 
tutorial, metal effects can be used to give depth to a flat 
object within a layer. What if the object you're creating 
rotates about a central point? This tutorial tackles this 
problem of rendering a 3D object in a 2D program by 
creating a spring.

Although many metal effects seem as though they take 
a long time to master. actually they're some of the 
easiest to conquer. Why? Well, the color palette is 
dramatically reduced from other effects, as shades of 
gray are the primary ingredient. Possibly the most 
difficult aspects are mastering t he gradients and 
reflections. Those can be trying, but taking a look at 
how light and shadow play on real-world objects can 
help to understand where they should be enhanced in 
your art.

Another of the more popular requests both Colin and I receive 
deals with the process of creating realistic glass and plastic. 
Before I begin, let me say this right up front: realism in glossy, 
transparent objects doesn't rest in how transparent they are. 
The secret. if it is indeed a hidden truth, rests in the manner in 
which light and shadow plays on, through, and behind the 
object. Indeed, this can be said about metal to a degree, though 
metal objects lean more toward gradient structure rather than 
reflection and refraction. 
As we go into the following tutorials. keep the above statement 
in mind. I'll start with a simple sphere and move on to more 
complex combinations of shapes, but always pay attention to 
the light. Light is your friend.

another instance of the selected area into a new 
layer above the background. This will be the 
foundation of our glass sphere. 
In the Layers palette, 
rename the new layer 
'Base Sphere'. 
When the circle was

Deselect the sphere once again. Select the 
Elliptical Marquee tool in 'New selection' mode, 
and on the Side Highlights layer. draw a circular 
selection that includes the lower right portion of 
the side highlights as seen below. Hit the DELETE 
key. 
Deselect the selected ellipse and then use the 
Move tool to position the highlights along the side 
of the sphere where you think they best fit the 
curve of the face. You may want to rotate the 
layer a bit to conform to the shape more 
realistically. To do this, go to Edit > Transform > 
Rotate. Grab a corner of the transform selection 
and move it accordingly, until the shape falls into 
place on the sphere's surface. When you're happy 
with the appearance, click the Accept Change icon 
on the options bar. 
The highlights are a bit stark, but 
we can correct that so that they 
blend with the overall reflection 
better. With the Side Highlights 
layer selected in the layers palette, 
CTRLICMD-click the Side Highlights 
layer to generate a selection. 
Click the 'Add layer mask' icon on the bottom of

Range to Shadows and the Exposure to 72%. 
Select the Base Sphere layer and 
run the Dodge tool along the lower

the Range set to Highlights and the Exposure to 
50%. At the very bottom of the sphere, darken the 
area next to the selection on the Second Sphere 
layer. 
37. Deselect the sphere again. One cool way to add 
character to the object is to place it on a flat 
surface. Select the Background layer and, using 
the Rectangular Marquee tool, select the bottom 
quarter of the Background layer. (The Marquee 
tool should be set to 'New selection', 0 Feather 
value and Normal style.)

the image. The point on the other side will move 
in the opposite direction an equal distance. 
Click the 'Confirm transform' icon in the options 
bar to confirm the change. 
We can enhance the glassy effect by adding a second 
image to the mix. The thought here is to see not only 
the background through t he sphere, but also reflections 
of yet another pattern on the face of the sphere, 
located behind the person viewing the object.

Now deselect the sphere once more. It's time to 
merge all of the sphere elements into a single 
layer. Select the Base Sphere layer and click the 
'Create a new layer' icon. We do this because in 
order to collapse the layer and make the style 
permanent, it must be merged with an empty 
layer. The style is no longer editable then, but is 
permanently applied to the layer. 
Select the topmost 
layer and use Layer >

layer until all the 
sphere layers reside in

I don't believe I've ever seen a perfect sphere: 
most have some distinguishing flaw or attribute 
to set them apart from others. Let's add a few 
flaws to the glass. adding not only character but 
enhancing the realism of the effect. 
Duplicate the Base 
Sphere 
layer 
and 
rename the duplicate 
'Bubble-1'. 
Go to Edit > Transform > Scale. 
Using the transform points, shrink 
the layer so that it appears no 
larger than a marble. Click the 
Accept Change icon to confirm the 
scaling. Using the Move tool, place 
the small sphere somewhere on the 
face of its larger twin. 
A bubble in a piece of glass is actually an open 
area. As a result it has its own surface, which 
reflects the opposite to that of the outside of the 
sphere. Go to Edit >Transform > Flip Vertical. Set 
the layer blending mode to Vivid Light, and lower 
the opacity of the layer to 60%. 
Duplicate the bubble 
layer several times, 
resizing each copy and 
distorting the layers 
with 
the

In the example seen below, the area where the 
blue overlayed image seems to be centered looks 
as though it's a point where the light would be 
magnified coming through the glass and, as a 
result, was highlighted with the Dodge tool. 
As stated before, this is more than merely a tutorial on 
creating cool glass. I hope you noted the process of 
generating the reflections and refractions. as they are 
key to the effect. The image used for the foundation 
isn't important; this sphere could have been made from 
a photograph of cinderblock and still looked good, 
thanks to a few tricks in lighting.

17. Something I've learned from Colin is that a crazy 
background adds to the overall effect of the 
design. let's get crazy with our background by 
selecting the Background copy layer and, in the 
Layers Palette, change the blending mode to 
Difference. 
Here's the result of this: 
Don't tell Colin I said this, but I find that he's correct on 
more occasions then I care to admit. Go figure!

The final tutorial in this chapter on things reflective 
gives a new twist to the process of creating chrome 
effects. With a few subtle variations, the process of 
creating chrome can also be used for generating glass 
and reflections that will stun your friends and cohorts. 
I'm stunned just thinking about it! 
To begin, create a new image named Chromed 
Glass. Set the attributes for the new image as 
follows:

Take a look at the image now: 
Whoever said that Layer Styles couldn't be fun and 
effective in designing special effects? Don't be one of 
the naysayers and pass them off too quickly. Just 
because they're easy to make and quick to apply 
doesn't make them less effective in stylish design. Try 
them on buttons, interfaces and logos. Enjoy! 
Start by going to Edit > Fill and select Black, 100% 
Opacity as the fill color. 
Now create a new layer, and then select the 
Custom Shape tool. Set the following attributes 
for the Paw shape, which can be found in the 
Animals shape set in the Photoshop Shapes 
Directory: 
Click the mouse in the 
upper left portion of the 
image and drop a large 
paw in the center by 
dragging the mouse to 
the lower right portion 
of the image. The shape 
will 
fill 
with 
your 
foreground color, but 
as we will delete it, 
this foreground color 
doesn't matter.

create a new channel. 
This will be called 
'Alpha 1'.

Once again, go to Edit > Fill. This time we'll use 
White as the fill color, with the opacity set to SO%. 
This will give the appearance of a gray fill, though 
it will actually be semi-transparent.

Return to the Layers palette and create a new 
layer. Reopen the Fill dialog box and set the fill 
color to gray, with the opacity as 100%.

select Alpha-1. Use Select > Deselect to remove 
the current selection. let's apply a blur at this 
point. Go to Filter > Blur > Gaussian Blur and

Nature has always been a major contributor to art. Inspiration 
is derived from the patterns, textures, and lighting we see 
around us. Some artists use material found in nature as a basis 
for their work. A huge tree was snapped off close to the base in 
my neighborhood - a local sculptor used a chainsaw to turn the 
stump into a grizzly bear. 
This chapter takes two approaches to applying nature to art. 
We'll use natural textures and photographs for implementation 
in our images. as well as incorporating natural elements in 
images from scratch, using only the tools given to us by Adobe 
Photoshop.

Below you can see our completed image with the faded 
paint that fits into the grooves of the wood: 

Of all the tutorials that I've done so far, this is perhaps 
one of my favorites. I must admit that this came about 
quite by accident. As a designer I'm always trying to find 
new ways to revamp effects I've already mastered. but 
one day I had forgotten exactly how I did the water 
previously. In a bind, I started messing with a few 
commands I hadn't used in the process before ... and Oil 
and Water was born. One of the great things about 
Photoshop is that after you understand the tools and 
how different elements of the program work together, 
sometimes even your mistakes look good! 
1 
To begin. open Al-Metall. j pg found on the CD. 
In the Layers palette, 
click the 'Create a 
new 
layer' 
icon. 
Name the new layer 
Shape Layer 1.

Hit the D key to reset the foreground and 
background 
colors. 
placing 
black 
in 
the 
foreground. 
Click on the Custom Shape tool. In the options 
bar, click the small arrow next to the Custom 
Shape example window. A window will open 
showing the shapes currently loaded into 
Photoshop. In the upper right corner of the 
shapes window that opens is another small arrow 
button. Click this button and select Replace 
Shapes from the menu. 
On the CD, find the custom shape set named PMW-
Eyes . csh and load it into the Custom Shapes 
palette. Select the shape that looks like an eye 
with a tear running from the left corner.

For the rest of the Custom Shape options. click 
the 'Fill pixels' icon. Set the Mode to 
ormal, 
Opacity to 100% and Anti-aliased checked. 
Draw the shape in the new layer. To keep the 
shape to scale while drawing, hold the SHIFT key 
down. It will be filled with black automatically, as 
shown below. 
As you can see, this shape has a lot 
of sharp or hard edges. In order to 
turn this into water. we will have to 
do some softening and distorting. 
In the Toolbox bar, click on the Rectangular 
Marquee tool. Enter the following attributes for 
the Rectangular Marquee tool in the options bar:

Click and drag the Rectangular Marquee tool 
around the lower half of the eye shape.

Go to Filter > Liquify. When the Liquify dialog box 
appears, you'll see that the area enclosed by the 
marquee is centered in the liquify field. 
The 
feather of the selection has created a soft edge 
where the selection meets the mask. This indicates 
that only the area not covered with a red hue will 
be subject to our edit. However, as the selection 
was feathered. some distortion in the blended 
overlap will occur if you so choose.

On the left of the Liquify dialog box is a vertical 
menu of tools specific to the Liquify filter. Click on 
the topmost tool, called the Warp tool. 
On the right side of 
the 
Liquify 
dialog 
box, settings for the 
selected tool may be 
adjusted.

The liquify tool acts in a similar manner to the 
Smudge tool. By clicking and dragging portions of 
the shape, the Liquify tool drags t he pixels with it. 
In this manner, distort selected areas of the shape 
by dragging them down, or by using the Bloat tool 
to spread specific areas. 
When you are satisfied with your distortions. click 
OK. and go to Select > Deselect (CTRL/CMo+D).

So how can we enhance the reflections? One way 
is to use the Apply Image command, which I'll 
demonstrate now. Open Al- Clouds 2. j pg, found 
on the CD. 
In order for the Apply Image 
command to work correctly, both 
images (source and destination) 
must be the same dimensions. 
Before we apply the image to our shape, let's 
rename the layers in the palette so we do not lose 
track of them. Change the name of Layer 2 to 
'Shape Layer 1 ', and the name of Layer 1 to 'Shape 
Layer 2'. This maintains the original structure set 
up at the beginning of this tutorial. Once both are 
renamed, select Shape Layer 2.

CTRL./CMo-click Shape Layer 2 
to generate a selection of the 
layer's contents.

Can we enhance the effect? You bet. In the Layers

On the bottom of the Layers palette click the 'Add

Water and oil together ... they may not mix well in the 
real world, but they meld together in Photoshop just 
fine. Naturals really aren't too difficult to master, and 
once you have a few of the techniques down you'll be 
looking at your surroundings and wondering 'Hey, how 
do I create that type of bark? Let's see .. .first I would 
make a wood grain .. .'. What's more, nature can be a 
great inspiration for more abstract, fantasy art.

Every designer making electronic effects seems to start by 
creating basic wiring. These tutorials are all over the Internet: 
stroke a path or a line, apply a colored bevel to it and distort to 
give it a curved or bent aspect. Hide the ends behind another 
layer leaving only the beveled mid section visible and you have 
wiring. I'm not saying this to denigrate the effect, indeed I still 
use it myself, but once you've learnt it, it's time to move on. This 
chapter is all about using these basics as a springboard to bigger 
and better projects.

1. 
To begin, open an image to use as your 
background, or create a new image. You can use 
any background you want, but if you'd like to use 
the one shown here, then you'll find it on the CD, 
called "Wood Panels". 
2. 
Click CTRt/CMo+SHIFT+N 
and name the layer 
'Wire Coat'. 
3. 
Select the Rectangular Marquee tool. We only 
want a very simple rectangle, so in the options bar 
choose the following options: press the 'New 
selection' button (on the left-hand side). don't 
add any feathering, and set the Style to Normal.

4. 
On this new layer, start from the left-hand border 
of the image and draw a long rectangular 
selection to the middle of the image. 
5. 
Now select the Gradient tool. In the options bar, 
click the small arrow next to the gradient window 
to open the Gradient picker. For this tutorial, 
you'll need a specific gradient set created for this 
purpose. To load the gradient set in question, click 
the small arrow in the upper right corner of the 
Gradient palette. This will open the menu. at 
which point you should select Load Gradients.

Navigate to the CD and find the folder named

click Load. The new gradients will now load into 
the Gradient picker. Select the gradient named 
'Wire Sleeve Coat'. 
7. 
Select the 'Linear Gradient' setting in the options 
bar. Click the mouse at the top of the selection 
and drag it straight down to the bottom edge of 
the selection to fill with the gradient (holding 
down the SHIFT key as you do so to ensure a 
straight line). 
8. 
We're building a typical black cable. so the 
gradient is a bit light for our purposes. A quick 
Curves adjustment will correct that. Go to Image 
> Adjustments > Curves, (CTRL/CMo+M). Set the 
Input level to roughly 175%, and the Output to

projects. 
10. After clicking OK to accept the curve, deselect the 
shape (Select > Deselect or CTRLiCMo+D). The 
darker gradient fits the bill for the black cable 
better, and the curve not only darkens the cable, 
but also lightens the highlights. 
11. Click CTRLiCMo+SHrFT+N to create a new layer and 
name it as 'Section 1'. On this layer. make a box-
like selection at the right end of the cable. Fill the 
selection with the same gradient as before, from 
the top edge of the selection to the bottom. 
Hold the SPACEBAR down as you are 
dragging out your marquee in 
order to move it to the desired 
position. 
12. Go to Edit > Transform > Perspective. Select the 
point on the top left of the Transform bounding 
box and move it down to meet the corner of the 
cable. When in Perspective Transform mode. the 
bottom corner on the same side will move up to 
meet the bottom edge of the cable. Hit ENTER to 
accept the Transform settings. 
13. Let's use that curve we saved earlier. Go to Image

21. Once again, the gradient needs to be darker, so 
16. Deselect the current selection (CTRLICMD

vertical selection, slightly taller than 
Section 1. 
17. Go to Edit> Fill again, and use the same settings 
as last time, except for the opacity. Set this to 
100%. 
You can fill a selection with the 
current foreground color by clicking 
ALT+DELETEIBACKSPACE. To use this 
shortcut now, first ensure that your 
foreground color is set to black. 
18. Now zoom into your selection and go to 
Edit > Transform > Perspective. Select 
the point on the upper right corner of 
the transform selection and move the 
point down so that it meets the corner 
of Section 1. The bottom right corner 
will move up to meet the corresponding 
bottom edge of Section 1 automatically. 
click Cr RLICMo+M to open the Curves dialog and 
then load in the curve that you saved before. 
22. Click CTRLICMo+D to remove the selection. We're 
now going to add some grooves to the cable. 
Create a new layer above Section 3 and name it 
'Section 3 features'. 
23. Ensure 
that 
the 
Rectangular 
Marquee tool is still selected, and set 
it to 'Add to selection' in the options 
bar. Create several small square 
selections as seen here: 
Hold down the SPACEBAR while 
making marquee selections to 
reposition on the fly. 
24. Ensure that your foreground color is 
set to black and then click ALT+DELETE

elements joined together, you may often utilize 
layers you have already made for other pieces of 
the object. In the Layers palette, click on Section 
2. Drag the layer to the Create a new layer icon to 
duplicate it. Rename the duplicate as 'Section 4'. 
30. Go to Edit > Transform> Flip Horizontal and then 
hit ENTER to accept the change. Select the Move 
tool and use SHIFT and the right arrow key to move 
Section 4 to the right side of Section 3. This will 
maintain the vertical alignment, while moving the 
section 1 0 pixels at a time. 
31. Create a new layer at the top of the Layers palette 
and call it 'Section 5'. On this layer we'll make 
another rectangular selection as we did with 
Sections 3 and 2. Starting at the upper right 
corner of Section 4, match the left-hand side up 
to the right-hand side of Section 4, with the same 
height . 
32. Repeat the process for applying the gradient and 
curve as done to Section 2 and Section 3.

the left side edges match the right side edges of 
Section S. Click CrRLICMo+ T, hold down the SHIFT 
key as you drag to retain the original proportions, 
and keep the ALT key held down to scale from the 
center of the object. 
35. We're about ready to put the cable on a single 
layer. First. any layer with a style attached must be 
merged into an empty layer to collapse the style 
settings 
and 
commit 
them 
to the 
layer 
permanently. For this tutorial, Section 3 features 
has a layer style applied. Select the Section 3 layer 
and click on the 'Create a new layer' icon, so that 
a new layer appears just beneath Section 3 
features. 
36. Select the Section 3 features layer and go to Layer 
> Merge Down (CTRL/CMo+E) to merge t he 
selected layer with the empty one below. 
37. Temporarily turn off the visibility of the 
background layer, and then use the 'Merge Visible' 
command by clicking CrRl/CMo+SHIFT+E. Rename 
the newly merged layer as 'Cable'. 
38. Create a new layer 
between the Cable 
and 
Background 
layers, naming it as 
'Jack Section 1 '. 
• • • • •••• 
39. Use the Rounded Rectangle tool with the Radius 
set to 5 pixels, which refers to the size of the 
corner radius. Make sure that you have chosen the 
'Fill pixels' setting on the left-hand side of the 
options bar. 
40. Draw a small rounded rectangle in 
the Jack Section 1 layer, so that the 
right side protrudes from behind 
the cable. Then CrRLICMo-click the 
jack Section 1 layer in the Layers 
palette to select the shape. 
41. Select the Gradient tool. If the 
Default gradient set is not loaded, 
open the Gradient menu again and 
scroll down to Reset Gradients. In 
the Gradient picker, click on the 
Copper gradient. Fill the selection 
from top to bottom with a Linear 
Copper gradient. 
42. Although copper is a good standard for 
metalwork, most stereo connectors are more gold 
or silver in hue. Go Image > Adjustments > 
Hue/Saturation and change the Hue setting to 18, • 
and the Saturation to 25.

in the new layer, so that it protrudes from behind 
Jack Section 1. 
45. Repeat the process used for filling and coloring 
jack Section 1 on jack Section 2. Deselect the new 
section after you've finished the coloring. 
46. For added realism, highlights can be added using 
the Dodge and Burn tools. Let's use the Burn tool 
first, with the following settings for a Soft Round 
brush: 
fl>n9o. J~ts 
G Exposun· ijl.Hj •I :;t_ 
47. On the Jack Section 2 layer. apply the Burn tool to 
the area where the layer passes beneath jack 
Section 1. This gives the appearance of a slight 
drop shadow: 
48. Let's now use the Dodge tool to add some 
highlights. In the options bar. set the following 
attributes, once again with a Soft Round brush: 
49. On both jack Section 1 and jack Section 2, apply 
the Dodge tool to the areas where the gradient 
gives the appearance of reflection. Don't apply the 
Dodge too liberally; subtle highlights will do. 
50. When you are happy with the cable and jack, 
merge all the layers together except the 
background and rename the layer as 'Stereo 
Cable'. 
Here's the cable after a few more highlights were added 
with the Dodge tool. I've also added a simple Drop 
Shadow to add to the realism: 
Save the image as a PSD file somewhere on your 
computer with the layers intact so you may use the 
cable on other images or in other designs. The process 
was long and at times tedious, but some of the coolest 
effects, especially in realistic objects, require a bit of 
repetition. Here endeth the lesson.

2: Advanced circuit boards 
Math has never been a favorite subject of mine. It's not 
that I find it difficult... it's more tedious than anything. 
However, I love the math behind Photoshop. Moving a 
mouse, selecting commands and warping pixels are all 
results of formulae I could never hope to recreate on 
paper. Photoshop makes math fun to a guy like me, and 
I don't have to count my fingers and remove my shoes 
to get the desired results.

layer, taking up nearly the entire image. but 
leaving some space for a border.

add two filters that will result in creating a very 
subtle checkerboard effect.

are black and the open areas white make the 
circuits easier to work with. Maybe this is just a 
quirk of mine, but it works. Go to Image > 
Adjustments> Invert (CTRLICMo+l). 
12. The circuits must now be separated from the 
white background. Go to Select >Color Range. In 
the Color Range dialog box. click the eyedropper 
on any black portion of the image. You may do 
this either in the dialog box or on the image itself.

used previously. Create a new layer below Circuits, 
and then, with the Circuits layer selected, use the 
Merge Down technique. Rename the new merged 
layer as 'Circuits'.

22. Continue by creating a new layer at the top of the 
Layers palette. We'll now use the Rectangular 
Marquee tool to create chips to affix to the circuit 
board. Enter the following settings for the tool in 
the Options bar: 
23. Make a selection about one inch square in the 
upper left quadrant of the layer. 
24. Ensure that black is set as your foreground color 
and click ALT-DELETE to fill the selection with black. 
Keep the Marquee tool selected, but change the 
'Style' setting in the option bar back to 'Normal.' 
Increase the zoom on the image, as this can be 
delicate work. Create a small rectangular selection 
as seen in the screenshot below and hit the DELETE 
key: 
25. Move the selection down, leaving a black area 
between the deleted area and the new selection 
placement, and hit DELETE again. Continue around 
down the left side and then down the right side of 
the square, moving and deleting equidistant 
spaces. When done your image should look like

face of the Black Thing. 
30. Create a new layer above the layer you're 
currently on. Use the Gradient tool with the 
following settings to draw a White to Black 
gradient from upper left to lower right of the 
selection. 
Here's what your gradient should look 
like: 
31. Soften the effect slightly by lowering the Opacity 
of the gradient layer to 50%. 
32. Click Cm/CMo+D to clear the 
selection and use the Type 
tool to apply any text you like 
to the face of the chip. 
33. Use Layer > Merge Down (CTRLICMo+E) to merge 
the text layer with the gradient layer. 
34. Now create a further layer beneath Layer 1. Select 
Layer 1 and then merge it with the empty layer 
using the Merge Down technique to apply the 
style permanently. Rename the newly merged 
layer as 'Black Thing 1'.

35. Duplicate the Black Thing 1 layer four times by 
dragging it onto the 'Create a new layer' icon. 
Select the Move tool and, one layer at a time, 
position the new Black Things around the face of 
the circuit board. 
36. Not all components need to be the same size. 
Select one of the Black Thing copies in the Layers 
palette and click CTRL/CMo+ T to enter Free 
Transform mode. In the options bar, change the 
width of the object to 60%. 
37. Select the reduced Black Thing and duplicate that 
layer twice. Move these into place alongside the 
original copy. 
38. Once you are happy with the size and number of 
chips, select the topmost in the layer stack. Use 
Layer > Merge Down (CTRLICMo+E) repeatedly 
until all the Black Thing layers are merged into 
one. Rename the merged layer as 'Black Things'. 
39. We're going to make some glass diode-type 
objects now. Create a new layer at the top of the 
layer stack. In the toolbox, select the Elliptical 
Marquee tool and set the following options for 
this tool in the options bar: 
40. Draw a circular selection on the new 
layer away from the Black Things. 
41. Now go to Edit > Fill 
and select the setting 
here before clicking 
OK. 
42. Open the Styles palette (Window > Styles). load 
any glossy button/text style sets you may have 
available. For this example I'm simply using those 
I've created over the course of the last few 
chapters. You can find these on the CD.

43. Deselect the circular selection that 
you should currently have. Now 
click on a Style to apply it to the 
gray circle. This gives the effect of 
having a lamp, a diode, or some 
other electronic thingamajig affixed 
to the circuit board. 
44. Next, duplicate the layer several times. moving 
each object to a new position on the circuit board 
with the Move tool. Try applying different styles to 
the copies. When you have several in place. select 
the topmost glossy object and merge down until 
all the lamps are on a single layer. Rename the 
merged layer 'Knobby Things'. 
As a rule, circuit boards are slotted on one side. Trust 
me, I've had a bit of experience yanking cards out of my 
stable of PCs. You can tell how much I've learned in the 
process by the highly technical names I've given the 
layers in this tutorial. OK, only kidding. 
45. Select the Circuits layer in the Layers palette. 
Merge this layer down into the Board layer. The 
new layer will automatically assume the name of 
the bottom-merge layer, in this case Board. 
46. Select the Rectangular Marquee tool and use the 
technique we used earlier on t he Black Things to 
create slots at the bottom of the board. You need 
to make the rectangular selection. press DELETE, 
and then move the selection to the next slot area 
and repeat the process. Do this two or three 
times. 
As an added extra, I've made a few resistor-type shapes 
using the Rounded Rectangle tool with a smooth Inner 
Bevel and a blue Color Overlay. 
Take a look at that! A person not so familiar with the 
insides of a computer might mistake it for the real 
thing. 
Let's take a look at the board from another perspective. 
47. First. merge all layers 
except the Background 
layer together. 
48. Duplicate the Board layer by dragging it to the 
'Create a new layer' icon. Turn off the visibility on 
the 
original 
Board 
layer, by clicking the 
small eye next to it in 
the palette, and select 
the Board copy layer.

Here's what my image looks like at this point: 
51. As we have changed the perspective of the board, 
there should be an edge facing us. Duplicate the 
Board copy layer and then use the Move tool and 
arrow keys to move the new layer up two clicks. 
52. Duplicate the layer 
you just moved, and 
again move it up two 
clicks with the arrow 
keys. Do this four 
times until you are 
satisfied 
with 
the 
thickness 
of 
the 
leading edge on the 
circuit board. 
• • • • •••• 
53. Select the topmost copy and then use the Merge 
Down technique until all the circuit board layers 
are merged together. 
If you were to stack two or three of these circuit boards 
together as though they were attached to the inner 
workings of a PC. you would want to apply a Drop 
Shadow to help the effect. For the last example, I've 
applied a Drop Shadow. changed the perspective a bit 
on the duplicates and added a new background.

In this chapter. we have gone beyond the familiar 
simple wires, instead we've created a cable with realistic 
dimensions and features, thus increasing the complexity 
but also the authenticity of the object. It's the same 
with the circuits: rather than simply creating a pattern 
(for which there are a dozen applications, and not all 
electronic in nature), we took that several steps further 
to generate an actual circuit board. 
Photoshop is a great tool and a fantastic program, but 
in reality it is only as good as the person using it. I hope 
that. above all else. you'll walk away with a hundred 
ideas on how you may apply these techniques to your 
own method of design.

This chapter deals specifically with randomness, or at least the 
appearance of randomness. ln fact. this chapter celebrates that 
aspect of Photoshop design. 
I'll tell you right up front; there will be a lot of repetition of 
steps throughout the tutorials in this chapter. as well as from 
one tutorial to the next. The reason for this is that we'll be 
starting with something simple and then building on that until, 
by the final tutorial, we'll have some pretty fantastic effects. This 
chapter is a personal favorite of mine - l hope you enjoy it.

Go to Image > Image Size .. The reason for the

Click OK. Duplicate the Background layer in the 
Layers palette by dragging it to the 'Create a new

Masking now comes into play. By using layer masks and 
gradients. Photoshop allows you to render portions of 
layers invisible and visible. 
5 
With the Background 
copy layer selected in 
the Layers palette, click 
the 'Add layer mask' 
icon on the bottom of 
the Layers palette. 
When you create a layer mask. the foreground 
and background colors reset to black and white, 
as these are the colors that will dictate which 
portions of the layer are revealed and which are 
hidden. Remember, when working with masks, 
black conceals and white reveals. When you 
select a layer without a mask, then the colors 
will revert to their original settings 
b. 
Select the Gradient tool. In the options bar, apply 
the following settings to the Gradient: 
1. 
Starting on the left edge of the image, draw the 
gradient straight across to the right edge of the 
image (using the SHIFT key to keep the line 
straight). This will render the right side of the layer 
visible, and gradually become invisible so that 
portions of both layers may be seen with t he 
gray/blended portion of the gradient allowing 
both layers to blend in the center. 

The screenshot below shows what the gradient will look 
like applied to the mask in the Layers palette:

15 Reducing the size may decrease the resolution a 
bit, so go to Filter> Sharpen> Sharpen. 
16 The pattern is ready to define and use. Go to Edit 
> Define Pattern. In the dialog box that appears, 
name the pattern. 
r===-------~ 
~ 
17 Click OK. The pattern is now loaded and ready to 
apply. 
18 Let's give the pattern a test run to see if it is, 
indeed, seamless. Without closing the pattern 
image (we will return to it shortly), create a new 
image with the following attributes:

Go to Edit > Fill. In the Fill dialog box. select 
Pattern for the fill type and choose the new 
pattern from the loaded set. It will be in the last 
position. When it is selected, click OK to close the 
Fill dialog box. 
As you can see, the new image is filled with a nice, 
repeating wood pattern with no visible seams; each 
repetition of the pattern melds with the next without 
any stark lines where they meet. Minimize this image 
and return to the pattern image. 
As it stands, the pattern is seamless top to bottom, and 
left to right. If we stretch the process out a bit further, 
the image can be made to match on all four sides 
equally. 
2 • Duplicate the Background layer of the pattern 
image. With the Background copy layer selected, 
go to Edit > Transform > Rotate 90° CW. 
On the bottom of the Layers palette, click the 
'Add layer mask' icon. 
With the Layer Mask active, select the Gradient 
tool. Starting in the upper left-hand corner. draw 
the gradient down to the lower right-hand corner 
using the SHIFT key to constrain the angle to 45". 
Hit CMo/CTRL +E to merge the layers. 
Again, duplicate the Background layer. Go to Edit 
>Transform> Flip Horizontal. 
Click the 'Add layer mask' icon. Select the 
Gradient tool. This time draw the gradient across 
the image, from left to right horizontally. 
Hit CMD/CTRL +E to merge the layers. 
One more round of masking to go! Again, 
duplicate the background layer. 
~ Go to Edit > Transform> Flip Vertical. 
Click the 'Add layer mask' icon. 
Select the Gradient tool. In the options bar, check 
the Reverse box. This is a very important step - it 
swaps the colors of the gradient, changing the 
portion revealed and the portion hidden, primarily 
for variation in the effect. Not checking this box 
will render a totally different result! 

Starting at the top of the image, draw the gradient 
down to the bottom of the image. See the 
difference in the two images below: 
Hit CMo/CTRL +E to merge the layers together. You 
may define this pattern now. When you fill an 
image with the pattern, you will have a unique tile 
pattern that resembles wood in tone only.

2: Pattern creation - sharper 
In the previous tutorial, the default, gradual black to 
white gradient was used throughout for an even 
blending of the layers across the majority of the image. 
By adjusting the gradient stops - narrowing the gap 
between them - more distinction can be pulled from 
the resulting pattern. Did I lose you? No problem this 
will explain what I mean. 
To begin, open Al-Clouds3 . jpg, found on the 
CD.

Duplicate the Background layer. Go to Edit > 
Transform > Flip Horizontal. 
On the bottom of the Layers palette click the 'Add

10. The image I used for this tutorial was taken 
straight from my digital camera without any 
adjustments made. Go to Image > Adjustments > 
Auto Contrast (CMo/CTRL +ALT+SHIFT+L). This will 
brighten the image, toning down the heavy blue 
shading and enhance the yellows in the clouds.

Even though the previous tutorials resulted in some odd 
effects, we have barely touched the surface where 
pattern generation is concerned. This tutorial adds a 
few filters and distortions to the photo. taking the 
pattern generating to new heights. 
I strongly recommend that you record this as on 
Action (see Chapter 8), since the end result 
never turns out the same way twice! 
Before we begin, I should point out that this is an 
excellent way to recycle every image you have. That 
being said, if you get hooked you could literally fill up 
your hard drive with unique patterns. 
To demonstrate, I'm using a photo of my kids that didn't 
turn out very welL The focus was off, and in most cases 
this photo would be unusable for much. When we stick 
a pattern creator on it. suddenly a whole new realm of 
uses for the photo becomes apparent. 
To begin, open the image Kids-1 . j pg, found on 
the CD.

You needn't take my word for it, the screenshot below

I've saved the steps as an action (I'll get to that shortly) 
and, using the pattern image we just created, re-ran the 
entire thing through the same process. The new pattern 
is seen below. 
You may add further warping power by including 
another Wave command in the action. For example, I've 
inserted an additional Wave command just after the 
Paint Daubs command and the layer merge that 
followed.

Remember the Glass Sphere image we created in 
Chapter 2? What would happen if that image were run 
through the 'pattern warper'? Below you can see the 
before and after pictures. 

My favorite subjects for the 'pattern warper' actions I've 
created are images of people. The skin tones add a 
fantastic quality that is hard to duplicate with just a 
sunset or a tree. Below you can see an initial 
photograph prior to the pattern warp, and three 
variations of the effect: 
Keep in mind that all three patterns are of the same

There you have it. Using combinations of masks, 
gradients and filters, the patterns you can generate 
from a single image are limitless. No need to throw 
away old photos. as these techniques offer new life to 
images that otherwise have little or no use. 
81 

Much time has been spent in the preceding chapters creating 
images either from scratch or by manipulating photographs 
until the end result is unidentifiable from the original image. 
This chapter retains the character of its subjects, in that the end 
result will resemble what could be a real creature. however 
fantastic.

1: Skull face 
1. 
To begin, open the image 
Andy-Face. psd from the 
CD. Those of you who have 
read 
Photoshop 
Most 
Wanted 1 will recognize this 
guy; in that title I turned him 
into a borg. This time I'm 
going to help him lose a little 
weight! 
2. 
This effect merges two photos 
together; so open the second 
image, SKULL- Front .psd. 
3. 
With the skull image active, 
ensure that the layer with the 
skull is active and then drag 
this 
layer 
into 
Andy-
f ace .psd. A new layer will be 
generated to hold the skull 
just above the face layer. Now 
close SKULL-Front . psd . 
4. 
In the Layers palette, change the opacity of the 
Skull layer to 60%. This is required for the next 
step, as the skull needs to be resized to fit the 
shape of the face. 
5. 
Hit CTRLICMo+ T or go to Edit > Transform > Scale. 
Moving the transform points in the center of the 
top. bottom and sides, reduce the size of the skull 
to match the head beneath. 
Some key points to watch are 
the teeth, the nose and eye 
sockets. For instance, the 
teeth should appear over the 
lips. One common mistake is 
placing the top of the skull at 
the top of the peak of the 
hair. The hair actually extends 
above the skull an inch or so. 
6. 
Click the check mark 
button in the options 
bar, or hit the ENTER 
key, 
to 
accept 
the 
transformation. In the 
Layers palette, increase 
the opacity of the Skull 
layer to 100%. 
7. 
Select the Face layer in 
the Layers palette and, 
with the mouse, drag it 
above the Skull layer. 
In the past I've done this effect without using facial 
' 
distortions such as Liquify, but I've found that increasing 
features such as the eyes really enhance the effect. 
8. 
Go to Filter> Liquify. On the left-hand side 
of the Liquify dialog box you will see a 
series of tools, which are used to distort the 
brush area. The sixth from the top is the 
Bloat tool, which expands an area by 
moving pixels away from the center of the 
brush area. Select this tool now.

10. Starting with either the right or 
left eye, move the mouse so 
that t he center of the eye is in 
the middle of the brush. Hold 
down mouse button until the 
eye swells. 
11. Repeat the bloating process on the other eye. Try 
to keep the two eyes proportional to one another. 
12. The next tool we'll use is the Warp 
tool. This is used to redraw an area 
of the image by pushing the pixels 
forward as you drag. Select the 
Warp tool now from the top of the 
Liquify toolbar (left-hand side of 
the dialog box). 
13. On the right hand side of 
the

Some bleeding may occur, which means that some of 
the color from one area may 'bleed' onto a differently 
colored area. For example in the right eye below. Don't 
worry about this now, we can. and will, correct that 
later .

15. Click OK to accept the Liquify distortions and to 
close the Liquify dialog box. 
16. In the Toolbox select the Polygonal Lasso tool and 
set the following attributes in the options bar. 
We need to have the 'Add to selection' button chosen, 
as we'll be making two areas, which we'll be treating as 
one selection. We'll add 8 pixels of feathering in order 
to round the corners of our selection as much as 
possible. 
Holding down the SHIFT key while making a selection 
automatically changes the setting to 'Add to 
selection'. 
17. Make large circular selections around both eyes, 
including the areas above the eyes that were 
warped previously with the Liquify tool. Don't 
include the eyebrows in your selections. (We're 
using the Polygonal Lasso rather than an Elliptical 
Marquee so that the selection has an irregular 
shape). 
18. The eyes need to be placed on t heir own layer. 
Go 
to 
Layer > 
ew > 
Layer 
via 
Cut 
(CTRLICMo+SHIFT+J). Once the eyes have been 
placed in their own layer, select the Face layer. 
Change the layer Blending Mode to Overlay. which 
means you'll see the 
shading of the skull 
image but the color 
will be blended with 
the skin tones of the 
Face layer.

19. We have reached the point where it would be 
prudent to have a background rather than work 
with a transparent layer. This will assist in 
seeing the edges of the skull and face so that they 
may be blended together. In the Layers palette. 
select Layer 1. 
20. Go to Edit > Fill 
(or use 
the shortcut 
SHIFT+BACKSPACE to open the dialog box). Use the 
settings shown below for the fill. 
Now there's a strange looking character! He looks 
terrified ... must be looking in a mirror. 
21. CTRLICMo-click the Skull layer to 
load this layer as a selection. 
22. Select the Face layer with the skull selection still 
active and then click the 'Add layer mask' icon on 
the bottom of the layers palette. As you can see in 
the screenshot below, 
this creates a mask 
over the face in the 
same shape as the 
skull. 
23. Hit the D key to reset the default colors; 
black 
to 
foreground, 
white 
to 
background. 
In the Toolbox, select the Brush tool. In the options bar, 
set the following attributes for the Soft Round brush: 
The skin tone from the Face layer in Overlay mode has 
left a nasty stain on the teeth. This guy needs to hold 
back on the coffee! 
24. In the mask attached to the Face layer, paint over 
the teeth with the black brush. This will mask the 
areas of the Face layer that 
stained the teeth. Adjust the 
brush size as needed to get 
in 
all 
the 
nooks 
and 
crannies. 
25. Staying with the same layer. 
select the face image rather 
than the mask, by clicking 
on the thumbnail of the face 
in the Layers palette. 
26. At the moment, the hairline leaves a stark line 
across the skull's forehead. In the Toolbox. select 
the Smudge tool; use a Soft Round brush at 
around 35 pixels with Strength set to roughly 50% . 
• ·-~ r ...... ._. .-;,_,_ 
27. Use the Smudge tool to 
blend the hairline into the 
skull as seen here: 
28. Next, select the eyes 
layer (Layer 3) in the 
Layers palette.

....................................................................................................................... . 
29. CrRLICMo-click the eyes 
layer to generate 
a 
selection. Now, on the 
bottom of the Layers 
palette, click the 'Add 
layer mask' icon. 
30. Now return to the Brush tool again. Set the 
following attributes in the options bar for a Soft 
Round brush: 
31. Make sure that you have the mask 
selected and that black is set as the 
foreground color. Paint the areas 
above the eyes lightly to blend them 
with the mask. 
32. With the Move tool, move the eyes up 
or around in the socket until you are 
happy with their position. They may not 
require movement at all; this is up to 
you. 
33. Duplicate the Face layer in the Layers palette. As 
the Face layer is in Overlay mode, doing this will 
increase the depth of color the face applies to the 
skull. You may also desire to increase the contrast 
of the eyes layer by making a Brightness/Contrast 
adjustment. 
Now that's one happy Andy! 
2: Do you believe in Fairies? 
Perhaps elves are a figment of the imagination, and 
their derring-do is better left to Tolkien or other scribes 
of the fantastic. Or perhaps they really do exist and it's 
just a case of knowing where to look in order to find 
one! In this section we're going to build on the 
techniques used in the skull tutorial to create our very 
own elfish creatures.

With a lighter touch and smaller brush than used 
with the skull tutorial, raise the eyebrows of the 
subject so that they extend up and away from the 
eye. Repeat the process for the second eye. Try to 
keep them as uniform and straight as possible. 
This is a female elf, so think delicate! 
8. 
In the Liquify toolbox, select the Pucker tool, 
found just above the Bloat tool. Humans have soft 
faces, whereas elves tend toward sharper features. 
To increase the angularity and also 
exaggerate the eyes and cheeks, the 
Pucker tool is used to reduce the size of 
other features such as the mouth and 
nose, and to draw the point between the 
eyes closer together giving them an 
almond-shaped quality.

of her nose, and again hold down the 
mouse button to shrink this feature. 
12. Before reducing the size of the 
mouth, let's inflate the lower lip a bit. 
To reduce it now would make the lips 
too thin to be convincingly female. 
Select the Bloat tool again and center 
the mouse over the lower lip and 
inflate it a bit. 
13. Now return to the Warp 
tool and move the lower 
cheek in closer to her 
mouth. 
14. Reverting back to the 
Pucker tool. and with a 
Brush size of 255. center 
the brush over the model's 
lips and click/hold the 
mouse button to shrink 
the lips, jawline and chin. 
15. Now decrease the Brush size of the Pucker tool to 
90. Center her nose within the brush, and reduce 
it further. 
16. Select t he 
Warp tool. 
Again, center the tool over 
her nose, but this time 
move the nose up away 
from her upper lip and 
toward the eyes. This will 
give the model a pug 
quality. Click OK to accept 
the Liquify distortions.

Rotten wood paneling 
I'm sure you've seen wooden text effects before, but 
this tutorial will go beyond the norm to create some 
realistic looking rotten wood. While working through 
this tutorial, I recommend recording the steps as an 
action. For those who decide to give it a try, there are a 
couple of commands just for you. If you decide not to 
record the action, simply skip the step where noted. For 
more information on actions, please see Chapter 8. 
1. 
To begin, create a new document of 900 x 600 
pixels with a transparent background. 
If you'd like to record this as an action, start 
recording the new action now. 
2. 
On the bottom of the Layers palette, click the 
'Create a new layer' icon. 
Action alert: Recording stops, or messages, to 
yourself during the course of an action instructs 
the user on steps they need take in order for the 
action to proceed. As this action requires the 
user to enter text with the Type Mask tool, a stop 
is required. If a stop is not inserted at this point, 
the action will type the same text for you every 
time the action is played. By stopping the action 
and entering your own type, the text may be 
changed with the same end effect applied. 
If you're recording an action, stop recording 
now. Open the Actions menu and select Insert 
Stop. Enter text in the 'Stop' dialog box similar 
to the following: "Please enter your text using 
the TYPE MASK TOOL (found under the regular 
Type tool in the Toolbox). This usually works best 
with a thick font set to 160-200 points". 
Ensure that Allow Continue is unchecked at the 
bottom of the 'Record Stop' dialog box, and 
click OK. 
X 
Once the Stop is entered, click the Record button 
on the bottom of the Actions palette once 
again. 
3. 
If you're not recording this as an action, make sure 
that you have entered some text using the Type 
Mask tool (found under the regular Type tool in 
the Toolbox). Use a thick font set to 160-200 
points.

As we're working with wood, it's time to select 
some wood tones for our color swatches. Click on 
the Foreground color in the toolbox. Enter a color 
value of H=44 S=37 and 8=89. 
5. 
Now click on the Background color. Enter a color 
value of H=41 S= 99 and B= 58. 
6. 
Select the Gradient tool in the toolbox and choose 
a foreground to background Linear gradient: 
• I 
1-1 
7. 
Starting at the top of the type selection and 
holding the SHIFT key, draw the gradient straight 
down to the bottom of the type selection. 
8. 
Go to the Channels palette, (Windows > Channels 
if it is not open already). Click the 'Create new 
channel' icon at the bottom. A new channel 
named Alpha 1 will appear.

10. The Crystallize filter will help create the pattern 
to generate the rot area of the wood. This will be 
run three times, clicking OK after each time to 
apply the selection. Go to Filter > Pixel, te > 
Crystallize. Do this three times, with the Cell Size 
set to 32, then 14 and finally 9.

11. Deselect the text area (CTRL/CMo+D) and then 
CTRLICMo-click the Alpha 1 channel. The white and 
light gray areas will be selected, but the darker 
grays will not. leaving a jagged edge selection as 
shown below: 
12. With the jagged selection active, return to the 
Layers palette and select Layer 2. Go to Layer > 
ew > Layer via Copy (CTRLICMo+J). If you turn off 
the visibility of all but the new layer, then you can 
see the effect of the crystallization. 
13. The following steps will apply some basic wood 
grain to the new layer. Go to Filter> Noise> Add 
Noise, and add a Monochromatic Gaussian Blur at 
25%. 
14. Go to Filter > Blur > 
Motion Blur. Set the 
Angle to 90" and the 
Distance to 24 pixels. 
-
15. Let's draw some detail out of the grain with the 
Brightness/Contrast command. Go to Image > 
Adjustments > Brightness/Contrast. Edge the 
Brightness down to about -9, and move the 
Contrast up to + 33. 
16. Click the 'Add a layer style' icon on the bottom of 
the Layers palette. Select Bevel and Emboss from 
the style menu. Enter the following settings for the 
bevel:

I love the realism of this effect! It reminds me of the

and gum just as old affixed to the bottom. Ah. sweet 
memories ... 
Stone and embedded glass - two 
effects in one 
As I write this, Colin is sitting in my office as we develop 
the joint projects that appear later in the book. The 
discussion arose about standard type effect tutorials. I 
read these tutorials for inspiration and to see where the 
trends are going, to study the steps other authors and 
teachers take to reaching their end effect. 
I enjoy reading these tutorials, but I have a problem 
with some of them. Don't get me wrong, they're very 
good at getting the reader from start to finish in the 
quickest manner possible. But the fact of the matter is 
some of the richer effects require more steps. 
All that was to preface the length of this tutorial. There 
are a lot of things going on. but to reach the end result. 
the extended steps are needed. What I'd like you, the 
reader. to focus on, is the process for generating more 
in-depth effects. A bit more time spent on a project, 
even something as seemingly unimportant as type, can 
make the difference between a ho-hum cool effect and 
a mind-blowing trend setter that will produce imitators 
and adoring fans far and wide.

At the top of my list of the absolute coolest features in Adobe 
Photoshop is the ability to save presets, tools and techniques for 
later use and distribution. Actions and automation are my 
original passion. but from those little scripts I've branched out 
into layer styles. brushes. and virtually any setting that can be 
saved. 
I could write an entire book on the subject of automation and 
presets, and perhaps I will do so down the road. In the 
meantime, I hope this section will at least give a hint to why 
styles and actions are so popular. as well as some instruction on 
making and distributing your own cool effects.

Layer styles- A quick run 
through 
So what are layer styles exactly? Layer styles are settings 
that can be applied to layers and saved as a group of 
presets for use later. This allows for easy creation of 
identical effects used across multiple web pages. photos 
and so forth. They really are as simple as that. Any style 
may be saved for later use, and any saved style may be 
altered to suit your particular needs and design tastes. 
Like Actions, Curves and other customized settings, 
layer styles can also be distributed to other Photoshop 
users for their work. 
1. When you first open the Layer Styles palette 
(Window > Styles), several default layer styles are 
already loaded. 
These are Adobe's little gift to you; they are, however. 
of limited use. If you were to use one of these in your 
work, every other person in the world with Photoshop 
would instantly recognize them and deride you for it. 
They will help me illustrate the application of styles 
here though. 
2 
Open an image to use as a background (anything 
will do - you could use Al_Background2. jpg 
found in the Chapter_ 02 folder on the CD). With 
white as the foreground color. select the 
Horizontal Type tool. With a large font. type some 
text in a new layer. 
3 
Clicking another layer style icon in the same set: 
the settings are changed to those of the second 
style applied. 
As you can see, this is easy stuff and even basic styles 
can produce cool results. 
Layer Style palette viewing options 
Before we go into the process of building layer styles, 
let's take a look at the palette itself and a few menu 
features available. 
The viewing modes for the palette 
are changed by accessing the Layer 
Styles menu. This is opened by 
clicking the small arrow in the 
upper-right portion of the Layers 
palette. 
By default, the Layer Styles 
palette is in Small Thumbnail 
mode when opened initially. 
This mode is great if you don't 
care to see the name of the 
style or the effect, as it 
displays the style examples as 
very small icons with no name 
associated.

This view allows you to see 
the Layer Style names with 
no 
examples. When 
the 
designer created the Layer 
Styles for the default set, 
t hey were gracious enough 
to include in the file name 
what 
the 
style 
was 
designed 
for: 
buttons, 
images, textures, or text. This 
is a good rule of thumb for 
your own styles, and will help 
you keep track of what the 
original intent of the style 
was for, what image type it 
works best with, and so forth.

The obvious drawback to this mode is that you have no 
example to choose from, as in one of the Thumbnail 
modes. 
While we're here you may as well take a look at the 
other modes: Large Thumbnail, Smail List, and Large

in future. 
You can also manage the Layer Style sets and views via 
the Preset Manager.

If you have loaded other Layer Style sets and would like 
to return to the original default set supplied by Adobe, 
selecting Reset Styles from the Layer Style menu will 
remove the loaded styles and replace them with the set 
we looked at previously. 
On the bottom of the Layer Styles menu are several 
other sets you may load by selecting them from the 
menu. Those seen in the example screenshot below are 
sets also included with Adobe Photoshop. If you save 
other sets to the Layer Styles directory in Photoshop, 
these will appear here also. There is a limit to how many 
will appear. If you are in the habit of collecting and 
saving styles, this author recommends saving them 
outside of Photoshop entirely. They may be loaded 
from anywhere on your computer or a CD. and it's best 
not to clutter the Photoshop folders any more than is 
necessary.

If you select Load Styles. the new set will be added to 
those already resident in the Layer Styles palette. 
If you want to replace a loaded set entirely with a new 
set, select Replace Styles from the Layer Style menu. 
Again, Photoshop will ask you to locate the layer style 
set. Find it, load it, and the new set will be the only one 
appearing in the Layer Styles palette. You may then click 
on a style to apply it to the layer contents. 
For some of the more advanced users. these may be old 
hat. For the new users or those just becoming familiar 
with Layer Styles. don't let them intimidate you. For 
quick, easy and slick effects, there is nothing faster than 
these little goodies. 
1: Creating a layer style 
As you've seen, loading and applying layer styles is 
extremely simple. The process of creating and editing 
them is a bit more in-depth, but this is only due to the 
wide variety of choices you have in creating the style. I'll 
walk you through the process of creating a layer style 
for text, but please keep in mind that I only have space 
to scratch the surface of the settings available to you. 
1 
To begin creating the style, open a background 
image. In order to achieve a similar effect to the 
one I have created here it would be a good idea 
to use a red background. Create a new layer and 
enter some type as we did in the previous 
example.

At the bottom of the 
Layers palette, there are a 
series 
of 
icons 
that 
through the course of the 
book you should have 
become familiar with. The 
first icon on the left-hand 
side gives you style options 
to apply to your layer. A 
menu 
will 
open 
with 
several selections.

When you select something from the Layer 
Styles menu, the 'Layer Style' dialog box 
appears. The one downfall about the 'Layer 
Style' dialog box is that it's so large it covers the 
image that you're working on. For this reason, 
Adobe has included a layer style preview on the 
right-hand side. You may gauge your progress 
by looking at this preview, or moving the 'Layer 
Styles' dialog box to the left or right so you can 
see your image. 

LAYER STYLES AND ACTIONS FOR COOL EFFECTS 
Since we selected Bevel and Emboss ... from the menu, 
the default bevel settings appear. As you proceed in 
adding styles to the layer. they're applied to both the 
image and the preview. You must click OK for them to 
be accepted. however.

23. Hey, what happened? The stroke made the 
background appear through the text! Actually the 
answer is pretty simple. Since the background is 
primarily red and the stroke is set to multiply the 
red color used in the stroke, the background 
becomes visible due to the closeness in hue 
between the background and the stroke. We will 
change that later, but I quite like the translucent 
effect, so let's save t he layer style as it is now for 
later use. 
2· Saving a laye style 
1. 
Click the New Style button on the 
right-hand side of the 'Layer Styles' 
dialog box. 
2 
A dialog box will open asking you to name the 
style before you save it. Once you've named it (or 
allowed Photoshop to assign the next sequential 
name), click OK. Naming is part of the process, 
and you should choose a name that best reflects 
the effect and what it is to be applied to. For 
instance 'Red Plastic Bevel-TYPE' might work well 
for this style. 
That's it -you've saved the layer style you just 
created. It now appears in the loaded set as the 
last icon on the bottom right. 
In the Layers palette, the styles applied to the layer 
appear as an expanded menu. The small arrow to the 
right of the layer name will expand or collapse the 
menu. The 'f' tells you a layer style has been applied to 
the layer.

Editing a pre-made layer style is as simple as changing 
the settings. That's all there is to it. When I want to add 
a few quick styles to my arsenal, often I'll load a set I've 
saved previously and apply one of the styles to some 
text. Then with a few quick alterations, I clear the set 
from the palette, save the new style by itself, alter that 
style, and save the alterations several more times until I 
have 12 new styles or so and save the new set.

Let's alter the style we just created to make a few 
more custom styles. Open the Bevel and Emboss 
settings for the Layer Style. Enter the following 
settings for the bevel in the 'Layer Style' dialog

With the stroke option, you're not restricted to a

with a gradient or a pattern. Click the small arrow 
next to Fill Type and select Gradient from the 
menu. 
8. 
When Gradient is selected. a few gradient options 
appear. Open these options and select Shape Burst 
from the gradient style menu. 
9. 
Using a standard black to white gradient, the 
shape burst option applies the gradient as a 
bordered outline, as seen below:

11 This is a cool little trick for beveling the layer on 
the edges only. Select Bevel and Emboss from the 
left-hand menu. Open the Style menu. On the 
bottom of the style menu is a selection called 
Stroke Emboss. When this is selected, the bevel 
will only be applied to the stroked area. If you 
increase or decrease the size of the stroke, the 
bevel increases or decreases to match it. 
12. For this exam pie, I'll return to the 
standard Inner Bevel and save the 
layer style. Once again click on the 
ew Style ... button and name the 
layer style appropriately. 
13 The new style again appears at the bottom of the 
layer Styles palette.

Actions - a quick un through 
This is it. These little scripts are what started the whole 
Photoshop ball rolling for me, and still hold a place of 
esteem in my heart. I've branched out considerably 
since finding Actions, but always return to them like old 
friends. The original intent of Actions was for quick 
batch processing of multiple photos. but some 
designers realized this was an extremely narrow view, as 
most of the commands in Photoshop can be recorded 
and replayed. making them an excellent tool for 
streamlining website or artistic design. 
Still, there remains very little information on the 
Internet about creating and saving Actions. Most books 
only give them a cursory glance, if mentioning them at 
all. I do have more tutorials on the subject on my 
website, so if you find them intriguing I encourage you 
to visit once you've made it through this section of the 
book (hup://actionfx.com). 
let's take a look at the Actions palette, and hopefully I'll 
be able to shed some light on its operation and 
usefulness. 
First, you may access the Actions palette by going to 
Window> Actions. You may also bring it to the fore by 
hitting F9. Once the palette is visible, it appears with 
several Actions available. In the example below there 
are several Actions I've created residing in the palette.

In the previous image, the palette is in Edit, or list 
mode. It has been called both, but I prefer Edit mode as 
this view is required to change or record actions. We'll 
play with this mode more in a bit. In the example above, 
the sets containing actions are displayed. To access the 
actions themselves, the arrow next to the set name 
needs to be clicked. This expands the set. showing the 
actions contained therein. Actions may only be saved 
in sets. For instance. an action must be placed in a set 
in order for the Save Actions command to become 
available. Also, the set must be highlighted. An action 
set may contain one action or many, but even a single 
action must be in a set. 
You set up the action options from 
the Actions menu. which is accessed 
by clicking the small arrow in the 
upper right corner of the Actions 
palette.

The second mode of the Actions palette is Button 
Mode. When the palette is in this state. the actions 
cannot be edited; the action will simply run to 
completion when clicked. 
Docie to Pel•tta Well 
In Button Mode, the actions appear as simplified 
buttons. The actions in the loaded sets are displayed. 
and not the sets as in Edit Mode. If an action was 
assigned a color code during creation, then the button 
will be the color assigned to it. Also, if any shortcut key 
combinations (up to 60 available) were assigned, these 
will appear alongside the action name.

Once loaded, you can select the action by clicking on 
the action name. Now when you click the 'Play 
selection' icon at the bottom of the palette or click the 
action button in button mode. the action will start 
running. It will replay the settings used when it was 
recorded exactly as the designer of the action set them.

Sometimes additional steps that aren't recordable need 
to be performed, or special instructions need to be 
followed for the action to work properly. In these 
instances you may see a pop-up message (called a Stop) 
appear giving instruction on steps to take before 
proceeding.

A Stop may also appear at the end of the action. The

You may edit commands in an action by finding the 
command in the action and double-clicking it. If the 
command has a dialog box attributed to it. it will appear 
and the action will start recording. You can enter the 
new setting, click OK. and the action will record the 
new setting and stop recording for you.

Sometimes changing action settings will affect the 
performance of the action, giving error messages and 
stopping the action. For instance, I've changed the 
Make setting at the top of the action's command list to 
use a transparent background rather than the white it 
was initially filled with. When the action is re-run with 
the new setting, an error pops up when a Select 
Background command is reached. Why? Because the 
action was to select pixels from the background, and 
now none are present.

This is not always debilitating; often you may just click 
Continue and the action will proceed normally. On

the end of the action, as is the case here.

Changing the Make command back to the original

Actions may also run on different sized objects and

instance, the action example below requires a type 
selection again. The font size of some of the text can be 
reduced or enlarged, and the action will still run 
normally.

4: Creating Actions 
As stated previously, actions can only be saved as sets. 
Many actions can be saved to a set. or just a single 
action; however you do it. a set must be present. Let's 
walk through the process of creating an action. 
1. 
To begin, ensure the Actions palette is in Edit 
mode. If not, change it in the actions menu by 
clicking Button Mode to uncheck it. 
2. 
On the bottom of the Actions palette, click the 
'Create new set' icon. If you do not, the new 
action will be placed in the existing action set (or 
active set if more than one are loaded). We want 
the new action to be saved by itself for the 
purposes of this tutorial, so creating a new set and 
placing the new action there will allow us to do 
this. If a new set is not created now, it may be 
created later and the action moved there then. 
This icon looks like a file folder. 
3 
Name the set, or just click OK. You can change the 
name later. 
-I 
4. 
A new, empty Action set will appear in the Actions 
palette at the bottom of the loaded actions list. 
I 
5. 
Next to the 'Create new set' icon is the 'Create 
new action' icon. Click this with the set selected to 
create a new action within the set. You can either 
name the action in the dialog box or name it later.

6. 
Shortcut key combinations can be assigned to the 
action when you create it initially. Using 
combinations of the F (function) keys, the SHIFT 
key and CTRL!CMo, up to 60 shortcut key 
combinations can be assigned to different actions. 
7. 
The actions you create may also be color-coded to 
categorize them for photos, text, buttons, or 
whatever categories you care to create. For this 
example I'll be creating a text action, and coding 
it blue. When in Button Mode, the button for this 
action will have the assigned color.

8. 
Clicking Record in the 'New Action' dialog box 
starts the recording process. Unless you stop it at 
some point. all the commands you apply to the 
image from here on will be recorded into the 
action. The depressed red icon on the bottom of 
the Actions palette indicates the action is 
recording. 
....J Sot I 
v 
• 
9. 
For the first command, I'll record the creation of 
a new image. This is done normally, just as though 
the action were not recording. 
10. Once you've clicked OK in 
the 'New' dialog box. the 
command appears as the 
first 
function 
in 
the 
recorded action, complete 
with all the settings assigned 
to it. 
11. Now to proceed with the image creation. First I'll 
fill the background with a gradient. 
12. Next I'll enter some text with the Horizontal Type 
Mask tool. 
., .. , .....

15. Now I'll stop the action by hitting the 'Stop 
playing/recording' icon on the bottom of the 
Actions palette. 
16. Replaying the action gives me the exact same 
result as when I recorded the action, including the 
same font and same text. 

LAYER STYLES AND ACTIONS FOR COOL EFFECTS 
17. Running the action again, I can stop the action at 
the point where the text is entered, by hitting the 
stop icon. the escape key etc, and change it to my 
own message and my own font by highlighting the 
selected type with the Type tool selected.

18. When the action completes its run, the new font 
is in place with the same bevel settings applied to 
the original file. Running the action and changing 
the font again reveals a similar result. 
19. Once the action is complete to the designer's 
tastes, double-clicking the Action Set name allows 
you to rename the set. Click OK to accept the 
name change.

If you're saving a single action to a set, generally you'll 
just rename the action with the same name as the set 
it's contained in.

5: Using Actions as tutorials 
The single most prevalent question I receive via my 
website is, "How did you do that?" referring to a 
particular technique or action result from something 
they downloaded from my web page. The action plays 
just fine, but watching and memorizing the steps to 
duplicate it without the action can be a bit tricky . 
You could change the Playback Options by clicking on 
this choice in the Actions menu. This will allow you to 
set the speed at which an action will play through, in 
order to allow you to absorb the processes the action 
plays through with a short interval between each step. 
Porl<lrmanct

r Slllll>fS!OQ

!;> Pause For AUdb A(rletouon 
The drawback with this solution is that you cannot see 
the exact settings in the action. Clicking commands in 
the action to see the settings applied works for those 
with dialog boxes, but what about the settings that 
don't have dialog boxes? 
There is a trick you can pull that lets you use action files 
as step-by-step tutorials, ready for printing with each 
step clearly defined and ready to be studied, copied and 
learned. An action is basically a text file that Photoshop 
assigns an . atn extension to, allowing it to recognize 
the file as a macro to be followed. You can, however, 
save any action you want to learn from as a text file, 
viewable in Notepad, a Word document or whatever 
text editor you have that will allow you to view 
documents with a . txt extension.

LAYER STYLES AND ACTIONS FOR COOL EFFECTS 
As an example, I've loaded an 
action I created a while back. 
When played, the action creates a multi-layered metal 
effect that I think looks pretty cool. What if I want to 
duplicate the effect as a tutorial for use in an online 
article? I can't quite remember how I did it. and the 
action is very long; memorizing the process would be 
extremely time-consuming. 
To save the action as a text file, first all other actions 
need to be deleted from the palette. If not, then all 
commands for all actions will be saved in the text file, 
and that could take up a couple of reams of paper if 
printed! 
Make sure you have saved the actions, as shown in step 
21 above, before you delete them. Then you can simply 
drag and drop them into the trashcan icon at the 
bottom of the Actions palette, safe in the knowledge 
that you will be able to access these actions later by 
going to Load Actions in the Actions menu. 
1. 
To save the action as a text file. highlight the 
action set in the Actions palette and hold down 
the CTRLICMo key and the ALT key. Open the 
Actions menu and go to Save Actions... You'll 
notice that when the Save dialog box appears 
Actions (*.TXD appears in the Format slot on the 
bottom. Enter a name for the action text file, as 
this does not carry over from the Action you're 
saving. 
2. 
Find the folder you'd like to save the text file to 
and click Save. 
• S'-Gdd 
.

3. 
Open Notepad or another text editor. Find the file 
you just saved and load it into the text editor.

You may now print the file and use it as a visual guide 
or tutorial to walk you through the process of 
recreating the effect! Now there are no secrets between 
you and action designers across the globe. 
Distributing Actions and Layer 
Styles 
Once you have saved an action or layer style set to your 
hard drive, anyone with Photoshop 7 should be able to 
use it on their system. It is a simple matter of sending 
them the file, which they can then load into Photoshop 
and apply to their own images and text. The Adobe 
Exchange is an excellent site allowing people to 
redistribute their creations to the masses. 
Adobe Exchange: 
http://share.studio.adobe.com/Default.asp 
That's it for the layer styles and actions chapter. I hope 
I've been able to shed a little light on these powerful 
tools, and helped you on the way to creating your own 
customized effects.

What is 3D realty? A 2-dimensional object has height and width; 
the third dimension is depth. While we can't truly create depth 
in Photoshop or any other flat medium, we can create the 
illusion of the third dimension. In this chapter and the next, 
we'll look at how to become a magician and create the illusion 
of depth using the tools in Photoshop. 
To create the illusion of depth there are three big players: 
II 
lighting. Where light hits an object and reveals 
surface density and convex surfaces. 
• 
Shadows. Where light is obstructed and reveals 
depth by the density of the shadows and shows 
concave recesses. 
• 
Perspective. Where the appearance of an object's 
size diminishes over distance. 
You'll see these principles come into play over the course of the 
next few tutorials. To stay with the spirit of Most Wanted. let's 
jump right into it!

Transforming clip art images 
This tutorial will change the way you use clip art. Clip 
art can sometimes be flat and boring, lacking in any 
depth or realism (of course there is some clip art that is 
excellent and fine just the way it is). I'm going to show 
you how to take the simple drawing on the left and 
transform it into the image on the right. Best of all, you 
will need no artistic abilities at all to do this. 
1: Importing a vector object to 
Photos hop 
As you may already be aware, vector objects are those 
based on mathematical anchor points. For example, 
there may be an x point here and a y point there, and 
there's an instruction to draw a radius of a circle using 
the two, or to join them with a straight line. Certain 
stroke widths and colors may be assigned to them. 
These objects aren't based on any particular size and 
therefore they're resolution-independent. 
Photoshop on the other hand mainly uses raster images. 
These are based on actual pixels. A pixel is a tiny point 
that may be filled with any color. All your photos are a 
combination of tiny pixels that appear as smooth 
objects. 
A lot of clip art comes in vector form. The main formats 
are EPS (Encapsulated Postscript) and AI (Adobe 
Illustrator). When we place these objects into 
Photoshop they are rasterized or, in English, converted 
from vector to raster (Math to pixels). 
There are several ways of bringing clip art into 
Photoshop. For this book we'll use the following 
method; this is the simplest and most flexible way to do 
it. 
1. 
Create a new document called Clip art, sized 800 
x 600 pixels, with the resolution set to 72 ppi for 
screen or 300 ppi for print. 
Once you've created the new document, you'll want to 
import the clip art. Go to File > Place and browse to the 
file called ClipArt .pdf in the Chapt e r _09 folder on 
the CD. (Don't worry about creating a new layer - the 
object will come in on its own layer). 
2. 
Your clip art will appear in 
your document with a box 
around it. The box indicates 
that it's still in vector 
format. 
3. 
Drag on one of the corner points while holding 
down the SHIFT key to resize the object. It's very 
important to resize the image now; because once 
you convert it to a raster you'll lose quality by 
resizing. Remember that a vector object can be 
scaled without loss. 
4. 
Press the Enter key to apply the transformation 
and the image will become rasterized. The image 
is now on its own layer and is a raster (or bitmap) 
object. 
The next step is to separate all the elements of the 
image onto separate layers. 
If you're familiar with vector programs such as 
Illustrator, Freehand and Core/Draw, separate 
the layers in the vector program and import all 
the layers separately into Photoshop. If you do 
this, you can skip the next few steps.

2: Separating the layers 
1. 
Select the first object using the Magic Wand tool. 
In this case we're selecting the buttons on the 
stopwatch. To select more than one object at a 
time hold down the SHIFT key and click with the 
Magic Wand tool. Keep the tolerance at the 
default 30. 
2. 
Go to Layer> 
ew > Layer via Copy (CTRL/CMo+J) 
to copy the selection to a new layer. You'll now 
see the buttons on their own layer. Don't forget to 
name the layers for ease later on. 
3. 
Continue copying the elements of the original 
object layer in the same fashion until each part is 
on a new layer. Your Layers palette should look 
something like this now: 
4. 
Select the main section of the stopwatch and hide 
all the other layers. 
S. 
Let's use the layer styles to add some depth to 
this. Click on the 'Add a layer style' icon at the 
bottom of the Layers palette to add a layer style. 
Apply an inner bevel as shown. Pay special 
attention to the Gloss contour. this gives us the 
shine on the bevels.

They're looking much better already . 
The best way to add depth to cylindrical objects is with 
the use of gradients. We're now going to use three 
totally different approaches to apply gradients to 
shapes. 
9. 
Reveal the top section of the watch. CTRL/CMo-
click the layer thumbnail to load a selection 
around the shape. We're going to use an 
adjustment layer this time so that the selection 
will make sure the adjustment is applied to the 
selected area only and not the entire image.

10. Click on the 'Create a new fill or adjustment layer' 
icon in the layer palette. The adjustment layer 
options will pop up. Choose Gradient.

remove the color. This is a really quick way to 
apply a gradient. later in this tutorial we will 
create a new gradient. This way you will be able to 
choose which method you prefer. 
13. Now reveal the top part of the button. We are 
going to do exactly the same thing, but we'll use a 
different method to help build your skill set. 
14. Add a gradient overlay layer style by opening the 
'layer Style' dialog as above. Choose the same 
gradient (copper) and the Luminosity Blending 
Mode.

click and drag with the Gradient tool at the same 
angle as the button, but only go across the width 
of the shaft of the push button, as shown, to 
constrain the gradient to the shaft itself. 
20. You should now have a metal-
looking gradient across the push 
button shaft. Do not deselect 
yet. 
21. Now to keep the selection only on the top part of 
the button. Choose the Polygonal Lasso tool.

exactly the same manner, 
except this time, drag the 
width of the tip of the push 
button 
instead 
of 
the 
narrower shaft. 
The push button is looking a lot more realistic now.

RIGHT/CTRL-click and choose Flip Horizontal. 
Holding down the SHIFT key as you drag an 
object will keep it on the same vertical, 
horizontal or 45 degree axis. 
25. Reposition the second button. 
3: Making a display 
Let's create a new display for the watch. The original 
one is kind of basic, so we will start from scratch. Relax. 
it's not too difficult! 
26. Choose the main body 
layer, Layer 1. 
27. Using the Magic Wand tool, click inside the display 
area. This will load a selection in the shape of the 
display. 
28. Create a new layer and name it 'display'.

used 151.186,155; a gray/green color. 
30. Fill the selection with the 
color. 
31. Let's add 
a bit of 
realism to the display. 
Go to Filter > Noise > 
Add 
oise and choose 
the 
settings 
shown. 
Press OK to apply the 
texture to the display. 
32. Use the Type tool to add some numbers to the 
display. Here I used Impact as the font. 
33. Lower the opacity of the layer to 80%. This will 
make the text blend a little with the background 
and not appear to be just painted on. 
4: Adding a reflection on the 
screen 
To give the display some realism, we'll add a reflection 
on the glass. 
34. ( TRLICMo-click on the display layer to load a 
selection. Create a new layer above the display 
and name it 'reflection'. Don't deselect at this 
point.

way to the top of 
the selection. 
37. Now we'll resize the gradient; this will help add a 
rounded look to the display. Go to Edit > Free

41. Now for the finishing touches. There are still some 
holes in the body. lefs make them appear like 
recessed slots in the plastic. Load the selection of 
the main body. 
42. Using the Polygonal lasso tool with the 'Add to 
selection' option, make a selection around the 
perimeter of the inside. 
You should now have the 
octagonal shape loaded 
as a selection. 
43. Create a new layer called 
'back' and drag it until it is 
just above the background 
and behind all the visible 
layers. 
44. Fill the back layer with 
a darker tint of the 
body color. 
45. Using the same color, type in some text. 
46. Apply an Inner Shadow in the 'Layer Style' dialog 
to the text to make it appear engraved. Use the

Here is the end result with a 
drop shadow applied for 
some extra effect: 
Compare the finished result to the original clip art. 
There's quite a difference and it wasn't all that hard to 
do either. 
This is a technique that you can adapt and use on all 
kinds of clip art images. This technique works very well 
on logos too. It's amazing what a few gradients and 
layer styles can do to an uninspiring image.

DE 
Photoshop ships with its own built-in 3D rendering engine. Not 
too many people are aware of this because it's called the 
lighting Effects filter. This filter, while useful for some simple 
lighting effects, can be very powerful when combined with an 
alpha channel. 
This technique is one that l have developed for several years 
and is quite advanced, but with some patience and practice, 
produces some stunning results. 
How it works is as follows. Instead of using a layer to create our 
image, we'll create it on a channel. The channel will respond just 
like a layer, except that it's limited to 256 shades of gray. Most 
of the filters and tools in Photoshop will work in channels. 
While painting in the channel, the thing we need to keep in 
mind is that we are drawing what I call a 30 map. A 3D map is 
simply an image that is used as the map for our 3D rendering. 
You'll need to think in depth as much as you think in shape 
while drawing the map. The brighter the gray. the higher it will 
appear on the finished object. Think of 50% gray as being flat. 
Anything darker is recessed and anything lighter is going to be 
raised.

White will be the highest point and black will be the 
lowest point. While we are creating the map, we need 
to think of height with our grays and not be thinking 
about shading and color. A smooth gradient will 
produce the appearance of a smooth slope on the final 
image. 
As you work on this tutorial you'll create an object that 
has smooth bevels that all fit together seamlessly. It 
would be impossible to create these bevels with Layer 
Styles. 
1: Creating the shape 
1. 
Create a new document in RGB mode. The size or 
resolution is not important. 
2. 
Create a new layer 
and name it. Using 
the Pen tool. create a 
path in the shape of 
your 
interface, 
or 
whatever you want to 
create. Make sure you 
choose Paths and not 
Shape layers from the 
options bar. 
• ,. 
3. 
Open the Paths palette and save the new path by 
double-clicking on 'Work Path' in the palette and 
using the default name (Path 1 ). We now want to 
fill the shape. To make a selection, either 
CrRLICMo-click on the path thumbnail or click 
Make Selection in the Paths palette.

Fill the new layer with black. 
Do not deselect at this point. 
5. 
Switch to the channels 
palette at this point. 
Click on the 'Save 
selection as channel' 
icon in the Channels 
palette to create a 
new alpha channel. 
6. 
You will now see your shape in a new channel 
called Alpha 1. Click on the new alpha channel in 
the Channels palette, and then go to Select > 
Deselect (CTRLICMo+D) to deselect. You should 
see a black screen with our shape in white.

Because the shade of gray determines the height 
of an image, what do you think will be the easiest 
way to produce a rounded beveled edge? Adding 
a blur to the edges will smooth the black and 
white line to a softer gray edge. This will be 
translated as a smooth bevel when we apply the 
lighting effects. Go to Filter> Blur> Gaussian Blur 
and set a radius of about 10 pixels.

We are now going to apply a blur a second time, 
but this time use 1 S as the radius setting.

This double blur technique will 
help produce a better looking 
bevel. It will be softer but with a 
more clearly defined edge than if 
we had just applied one large blur. 
Now to produce a separate recess into the shape. This 
is where is gets even more tricky. 
9 
Select the layer with the main shape on it. Use the 
Path Selection tool to bring up the path. You 
should see all the anchor points to indicate the 
path is selected. The anchor points are used 
together to define the shape of an object. 
EXPLORING tHE 30 ENGINE 
10. Now choose the Pen tool with 
the minus sign (Delete Anchor 
Point tool) and click on each 
of the points to the left and 
top of the shape to delete the 
points. We're going to create 
a path just around the area 
we want to recess. 
11. Each anchor point has handles, and these handles 
are activated when you click on an actual point. 
You can adjust the curvy lines by dragging on 
these handles. Choose the Add Anchor Point tool. 
If you click on a line between two points with this 
tool. a new anchor point will be added. But if you 
click on an existing point, it will activate and the 
handles will be visible.

Your final shape should look 
something like this. If you are 
using your creative licence and 
working on something different, 
that's fine too. 
13. Save the path and turn it 
into a selection in the same 
way as we did earlier on 
(CRTL!CMD-click on the path 
thumbnail or click 'Make 
selection' 
in 
the 
Paths 
palette). 
14. With the selection active, hide the layer with the 
shape on it. Create a new layer and fill the 
selection with a dark/mid gray to a light gray 
gradient as shown. Name the new layer 'Inside 
shape'.

.............. , 
15. We'll want the top part of this shape to blend into 
the existing interface, and we'll do this by using a 
layer mask. Click on the 'Add layer mask' icon at 
the bottom of the Layers palette. Now, vertically 
fill the top quarter of the mask with a black to 
white linear gradient to create a smooth blend to 
white on the top section of the shape. 
16. Below is the sort of result 
you're looking for. Select > 
Reselect 
to 
load 
the 
selection. Click Edit > Copy 
(CTRL/CMo+C) to copy the 
shape into the clipboard.

again and click our alpha channel. The selection 
should still be active over part of our shape as 
shown.

how the selection shields 
the rest of the shape from 
the painting. 
26. Finally, deselect your selection and then choose 
the Blur tool. Using the default settings, blur all 
the hard edges and make everything smooth. Pay

I used the same technique for creating the body of this 
camera image. I know it is a very complex technique, 
but the results are well worth it. 
Now for something a lot easier! 
3. Using 30 Transform 
We're going to use and abuse the 3D Transform tool in 
this section to produce some quick 3D effects. 
Adding text to a rounded 
surface 
Let's add some text to this egg image. 
1. 
Create the text you want to wrap onto the surface. 
2. 
Rotate it into position. 

3. 
We'll have to render the text layer to turn it into 
a regular layer. Right-click on the layer name in 
the Layers palette and choose Rasterize Layer 
from the pop-up menu. 
Let's give the text a rounded 
appearance. Go to Filter > 
Distort > Spherize, and use 
1 00% and the Normal mode. 
This is the result.

Here is the result. There is a gray artifact that is created 
at the top of the egg. This artifact is a bit annoying and 
needs to be erased. In a little while though, I will show 
you how to manipulate the artifacts and make them 
your friends. 
7. 
Draw a selection around the artifact with the Lasso 
tool and hit DELETE. 
8. 
Reposition the text and change the layer to 
Overlay mode in the Layers palette for a neat 
effect. 
4. Creating 3D shapes 
We're now going to quickly create several shapes in 3D 
using Photoshop. We'll be taking advantage of the 
artifacts and using them to create shapes that the filter 
was never intended to do. These are called primitives 
in the 3D world because they are t he building blocks for 
more complex shapes. 
Creating a sphere 
1 
Create a new document sized 800x600 pixels in 
RGB mode, with black as the background. 
2. 
Create a new layer. 
3. 
Go to Fi lter > Render> 3D Transform for the new 
layer. The good thing about the 3D Transform 
filter is that is needs no content on a layer to 
work. Choose the Sphere tool and draw a sphere. 
There's nothing to transform, so what is the point? 
Hold your horses, and watch this: 

4 
Take the Trackball tool and rotate the sphere until 
the artifact begins to show. Now continue to 
rotate until the entire shape is an artifact. Click on 
the Options button.

"Special effects, more special effects!" ... It's what everyone is 
crying out for. So in response to the demand, I've developed 
this chapter. This is where all kinds of fun and useful effects are 
revealed. We'll be looking at everything from diamonds. 
explosions with shockwaves, lighting effects with atmosphere to 
creating a shadow lens effect.

1: Rap d'amonds 
Ever since I was moderating the forum for Planet 
Photoshop, I've had requests for diamond effects. I 
guess I never found a method I was happy with. Then at 
PhotoshopCAFE, I had numerous requests for the same 
effect. People were adding a bit of noise to the text and 
calling it diamonds. Recently I sat down with Photoshop 
7 and decided that I would not leave my computer until 
1 figured out a good method for creating these 
diamonds. I'm very pleased with the result and you will 
be too. Get ready to "ice out" your images and text. This 
is the effect that's used on a lot of rap and hip-hop 
artists' album cover art. 
1. 
Let's create some text. The key to this effect is to 
use a good bold font. Here I used a good street 
font called Pricedown. It's available as a free 
download 
at 
www.myfonts.com. 
So 
first 
download the font and install it locally. 
2. 
Create a new document 800x600 in RGB mode. 
Type in the text nice and big, between 200 and 
300 will work well. The color is unimportant at this 
stage.

3. 
Render the text so we 
can apply effects to it by 
right-clicking on the text 
in the Layers palette and 
choosing Rasterize Layer.

Press the D key to reset the foreground and 
background colors. 
6. 
To set the base tone, choose Fill r > Render > 
Clouds. 
7. 
This is where the diamond effect develops. With 
the text selection still active, go to Filter > Distort 
> Glass. Choose 'Tiny Lens' as the texture. Make 
the scaling relatively small as shown in the 
screenshot. Move the distortion all the way up and 
the smoothness all the way down. This process is 
just a matter of experimenting with the settings to 
get the best result. Click OK when you've entered 
the settings.

stroke about 8 pixels. Actually, you'll want it as 
wide as you can without the letters overlapping 
each other. Choose 'Center' as the position.

In the first Photoshop Most Wanted book, the explosion 
tutorial was very popular. Now we're back for more. 
This time we're going to create a supernova-type 
explosion with a shockwave shooting out from the 
center.

Create a new layer and using the Elliptical 
Marquee tool, draw a circle in the page taking up 
about half the page.

the ring that would be behind the explosion. 
18. just to finish off the effect, duplicate t he 
shockwave layer. Lower the opacity of the 
duplicate and scale it up a bit. Then move it down 
from the original ring just a little bit. 
You can "nudge" the layer (move it 7 pixel at o 
time) by pressing the arrow keys on the 
keyboard. Additionally hold down the SHIFT key 
to nudge in increments of 10 pixels. 
There we go: an explosion complete with shockwaves.

3 Transparent le s shadow 
When light is blocked from an object, it creates a 
shadow on the opposite surface. In most cases the 
shadow is just a dark blur. What if the object is semi-
transparent and there is tight shining through it? What 
would the shadow look like? It's these little details that 
can really add a strong finishing touch to your images. 
We're going to create a lens type shadow. Shadow? Well 
really it's more of a glow.

may say so myself. This technique works best on darker 
than 50% gray surfaces. For lighter surfaces, experiment 
with different Blending Modes such as Hard Light.

This concludes the one hit wonder parade. We've 
covered a variety of effects, most of them dealing with 
light in some fashion or other. It's amazing the amount 
of impact light has on visual art. Look around at your 
surroundings and begin to take a mental note of the 
way that light interacts with your environment. This will 
help you immensely in creating interesting and 
authentic artwork. Have fun with these effects, 
experiment with them and create some interesting 
variations of your own.

1: Multiple rollovers 
Ever since I put up the homepage for www.photoshopcafe.com I have had numerous e-mails asking me how I 
did the rollovers. The page features a row of buttons that have a rollover effect. I also have a screen at the top 
of the page and when you roll over the buttons, the display in the screen changes to read a description of the 
link. 
. 
. 
......................................................................•......•.•...........••.•......................... 
...............................................................•.••••.....•••.....•..•..•....•...........•......•..•.•• . . 
This technique is called multiple rollovers, disjointed 
rollovers or remote rollovers. No matter what you call 
it, it's a great technique and very easy to create in 
Photoshop/lmageReady 7. 
For this example we're going to use an interface that I 
created for the tutorials section of the cafe. You can 
• find 
the 
completed 
interface 
on 
the 
CD 
(cafet uts . psd). You will find this interface with all the 
layers intact. for you to experiment with. 
Preparing the rollovers 
1. 
Open cafet uts-noslices .psd from the CD. 
When you create multiple roll overs, you have to 
think about what is going to happen and plan it 
out ahead beforehand. Decide what regions you 
want to change with the mouse activity and 
what you want them to change to. 
There are two things that are going to change on this 
interface. When the mouse rolls over a panel, it will 
change to orange, to make it look like it's charging up 
(basic rollover). At the same time, the text in the 
center orb will change to the name of the link (remote 
rollover). 
., ......•....•....••.••.....•............•...................•....••..•..•............................................. 

•••••••• 
•••••••• • • • 
•• • 
The source file on the CD shows all the panels in their 
rollover state. We'll be editing the blue layers on each 
panel (normal state). When the mouse rolls over each 
panel, we'll hide the blue layer to reveal the orange 
layer under each panel. 
2. 
You'll 
see 
the 
colored layers in the 
set called 'colored 
rollovers'. Click the 
eye next to the set 
to show or hide all 
the layers. 
3. 
Notice that as we hide each colored rollover layer 
it reveals the orange layer underneath. 
The way lmageReady displays rollovers is by simply 
turning on and off layers and/or styles. So the first thing 
you need to do to prepare your rollovers is to make the 
rollover images on separate layers in Photoshop. You 
should be able to click the eye icon in the Layers palette 
to see what your rollover will look like in each state. 
• • 
• 
The next thing we will need to do is create the remote 
rollovers. This relates to what will happen in another 
portion of the image when the mouse rolls over. In this 
example, the text in the orb will display differently for 
each panel. 
4. 
You will find the text 
layers under the text 
layer set. 
This image shows all the text layers turned on at once. • 
Obviously we'll never display the interface like this -
we'll display the links one at a time. I just wanted you to 
see the image with all the rollover images at once to 
help you better understand the technique we are 
learning here.

Slicing 
Slicing is a term you may have heard and may or may 
not understand. Let me explain it to you here. 
Currently we have one large picture with different 
layers. When we export it to the web it will become a 
flattened image. A large flat image is not very flexible. 
As you know, a rollover effect is created by swapping an 
image for another image. 
We would then have to swap the entire image for a new 
one for each rollover. That could be done, but would be 
a huge download. We would have to create five 
different images, one for the normal default image and 
one for each of the four rollovers. The smarter way 
would be to cut the image up (slice it} into a series of 
smaller pictures, and just change the affected portions 
(slices) of the images. When we add a slice. it tells 
Photoshop where to cut the image and how many 
smaller images will be created. When Photoshop creates 
the new web page (in the final step) it creates all the 
code that will piece these images together seamlessly 
like a jigsaw puzzle to give the appearance of one large 
image. 
The rollover effects themselves will also be smaller 
images that will replace the existing images when the 
mouse rolls over the defined region (usually a slice). 
The image inside each slice will be changed to produce 
the rollover effect. 
1. 
The first thing we need to do is decide how the 
slices will be created. Try to fit each rollover into 
one slice. They have to be rectangular in shape 
and they may overlap each other: however, try to 
keep this to a minimum as it increases file size. 
2. 
The illustration below shows one of the panel 
areas 
and 
the 
remote 
rollover 
locations 
highlighted as rectangles. We will want to turn 
each one into a separate slice. Begin by dragging 
out guides to help wit h the slices. Press 
CTRLICMo+R to open the rulers. Then just drag the 
pointer from the rulers to create guides, as shown 
here. 
3. 
Choose the Slice tool, and t hen click and drag with 
it to create a slice around the center orb. The slice 
will break up the page into smaller sections that 
will load individually. This will enable us to change 
just a portion of the page at a time and not have 
• 
to reload the entire page as a rollover image. 
Notice how Photoshop has added additional slices 
automatically, surrounding the one we just made. 
Photoshop will bisect the image to the slice edges, 
vertically, horizontally or both, to be able to 
generate the HTML coding.

5. 
We have now done everything necessary to 
prepare our image. (You could also do the slicing 
in lmageReady. but sometimes it is useful to do it 
in Photoshop as. if necessary. you can go back and 
make changes to your image more 
easily.) Let's bring it into lmageReady to 
create the rollovers. Click the 'jump to 
lmageReady' button at the bottom of 
the toolbar (CrRLICMo+SHIFT+M). This 
will launch lmageReady and import our 
image into its window. 
•••• 
• ••• 
The first thing you should do is optimize the slices. 
Since this tutorial is really about creating rollovers I will 
make the explanation of optimization very brief. 
Optimization is when we tell lmageReady the quality of 
the images to produce. We'll need to produce lower 
quality images for the web in order to cut load time. A 
balance of quality versus speed is required when 
optimizing. Often you can reduce the quality of a slice 
without it really being visually noticeable. Use higher 
quality for CD-ROM projects because they have a faster 
download speed. A basic rule of thumb is to use GIFs for • 
text and images with flat color and ]PEGs for photos and 
complex shading. I have just finished writing another 
book for friends of ED called From Photoshop to 
Dreamweaver: 3 Steps to Great Visual Web Design which 
covers slicing and optimization in a lot more detail. 
6. 
Select a slice with the Slice Select tool. Also click 
on the Optimized preview tab. 
7. 
In the Optimize palette. choose ]PEG and lower 
the Quality slider until you just begin to see a little 
image degradation. Try to keep it under 50%. 
Repeat this optimization process for each slice, 
including the slices that don't have rollovers 
attached.

Creating the rollovers 
Now that we have all the slices created and the 
optimization done, it's time to create the rollovers. 
1. 
Open 
the 
Rollovers 
palette. Choose the slice 
that is over the top left 
panel of the interface. 
Click the 'Create rollover 
state' icon at the bottom 
of the Rollovers palette. 
'j .,,,, .... _o, 
You'll now see the Over State. This is the image that 
wilt be created for our rollover effect. 
2. 
Open the Layers palette and hide the blue layer to 
reveal the orange underneath. This is what the 
rollover will look like. For the sake 
of 
understanding, I will call this the master rollover. 
The thumbnail display in the 
Rollovers palette will be updated to 
show the rollover image. (This 
screen shot shows all four rollovers 
for the entire interface.) 
Now we'll create our remote (secondary) rollover. 
3. 
Turn off the tutorials layer to hide the text that 
says 'tutorials' and click the eye next to fx in the • 
text layer set. This will now display 'fx' in the 
center orb. 
When a rollover state is selected in the Rollovers 
palette, lmageReady will change all the slices that have 
modifications (secondary) and not just the 'master' 
• 
slice. The master slice will act as the trigger for the 
mouse. If the mouse rolls over a secondary slice, 
nothing will happen. 
1~2

4. 
If you wish to go to a new page when the mouse 
clicks on the interface, select the Slice palette and 
assign a link in the URL field. 
"'""" (cof>M•...P< 
URI.: [tU'"""LtX.htrn 
Tor9"1: 
BG.E:::> 
5. 
Repeat these steps for the remammg 
three buttons and remember to reveal 
the correct layers to change the text in 
the center for each one. When you are 
done. click the Preview button in the 
toolbar. 
6. 
You can now roll your mouse over each button to 
test the rollovers. You'll have to pause on each 
button for a few seconds while lmageReady loads 
the rollovers. If any of the buttons don't rollover 
correctly, go back to the Rollovers palette and 
make 
sure 
that 
the 
correct 
layers 
are 
shown/hidden for each state. 
7. 
Click the 'Preview in Default Browser' 
icon to see what the interface will look 
like in a web browser. 
• • • • • 
• ••• • • 
8. 
The browser will launch with a functioning 
interface, and some interesting statistics, including 
the coding for the rollovers, on the page. 
9. 
Once you have tested that the interface works in 
a web browser, you can export it as a web page. 
lmageReady will create all the code and an HTML 
page for you. Go to File > Save Optimized As. 
choose a folder to export to and click Sav . You'll 
now see the HTML document and a folder 
containing all the sliced images. 
10. Launch the HTML document in your web browser.

2: Creating an animated 
slideshow 
We're now going to create an animated slideshow. This 
is not just a basic slideshow -
we're going to use 
lmageReady's tweening feature to create TV-like fades 
between the images. We'll then export the whole 
slideshow as one animated GIF. 
This technique will work best for kiosks, COs and 
broadband. It will also work for a regular web page, but 
I would advise using a smaller image for this purpose to 
help keep the file size down. 
1. 
Open the interface called animation.psd from 
the CD in lmageReady. You'll see that it is all in 
three layers: the frame, a black filler, and the 
background. 
We are going to turn the background into a matte. This 
will mean that all the pictures we add will not have to 
be cropped - they will merely need to be dropped into 
the layer beneath the interface. 
2. 
CTRLICMo-click on the interface layer to load the 
selection. 
3. 
Select the Background layer 
in the Layers palette. 
-
4. 
Go to Sele l > Inverse or CTRLICMo+SHIFT+I, so that 
everything will be selected except for the area 
around the interface shape. 
5. 
Go to Layer > New > Layer 
via Copy or press CTRLICMo+j. 
This copies the information 
from the background and 
places it on a new layer in the 
shape of the selection. Name 
the new layer 'matte'. 
6. 
Drag the matte layer to the 
top of the Layers palette.

7. 
Make a selection around the window area with the 
Rectangular Marquee tool. 
8. 
Press the DELETE key to remove the selection. You 
can now see all the way through to the black layer. 
This area will become our screen. 
9. 
Drag your images into the document. Here we 
have only used two to demonstrate the technique. 
You can choose as many as you wish. but 
remember, the more images, the longer it will take 
to load in the browser. If you plan on putting this 
on a web page or using several images, I 
recommend resizing and optimizing the images 
now. Choose any images you want. I have used 
two pictures of my vacation in Venice. They are 
Venice-1. jpg and Venice- 2 .jpg, and can be 
found on the CD. 
•••• 
• ••• 
10. Drag the images under the 
interface layer. The new 
matte we created will hide 
all the edges of the pictures. 
11. Resize and position the top image. 
0 
12. Hide the top image and reposition and size the 
next one. If you are using more than two images. 
continue with each image until they are all in 
position and ready for the animation. 
13. Show the top image again. Click on the Animation 
palette and then click the 'Duplicate current 
frame' icon to add a new frame, frame 2.

At the moment both frames are identical. 
14. Hide the top image again to reveal the second 
image. 
' 
We now have a two-frame animation. If we wanted a 
simple slideshow. we could just set the delay for each 
frame at 2-5 seconds and we would be done. However, 
we want to create a smooth fade between the pictures. 
15. Click the arrow at the top right of the Animation 
palette and choose Tween from the drop-down 
menu. 
16. lmageReady is now going to create a fade 
between the two frames. Tweened frames are all 
• 
the in-between frames that smooth out an effect, 
in this case, fading one image into another. 
Tweens were really added for motion tweens, but 
they work well in this example too. Use the 
• 
settings shown in the screenshot:

Since this is a looping animation. we need a smooth 
transition back to the original image. We will add the 
tweened frames to the end of the animation and 
reverse them to transition in reverse to the original 
image. 
18. Select all the tween frames: Frames 2 through 6. 
To select more than one frame at a time, click on 
the first frame you want to select, hold down the 
SHIFT key, click on the last frame and all the ones 
in between will also be selected. 
Holding down the CTRLICMo key and clicking 
allows for selecting frames that are not 
adjacent.

23. From the drop-down menu, choose Reverse

24. Press the play button on the Animation palette to 
watch the animation play. It will probably be a bit 
slower and more jumpy in lmageReady than in 
your web browser. 
• ••• 
• ••• 
25. When you have finished previewing press the stop 
button. You'll have noticed that the fades are 
looking good, but the anim2tion needs to pause 
for a few seconds on each of the images. 
26. Select frame 7, which is the second image. 
27. Click on the '0 sec' and a drop-down will appear. 
This is where you choose the delay. We will use a 
2 second delay. This will cause the animation to 
pause for 2 seconds on this f rame. 
28. We also need to pause the first picture on frame 
1. However, we want the animation to begin 
playing right away. So what we will do is copy the 
frame, paste it to the end of the animation and 
add the delay there. 
29. Once pasted we'll have a new frame, frame #13.

31. In the Optimize window change the file type to

size. 
Note that you'll only be able to choose the GIF 
option, as }PEGs don't support animation. 
32. Click the 'Preview in Default Browser' icon. 
32. You'll now see the animation launch in your web 
browser. Notice how much smoother it appears 
now. 
33. Finally, go to File > Save Optimized As to export 
your animated GIF. If you plan on using this in a 
web page. I recommend cropping the image as 
tightly as possible and reducing the overall size. 
This will make the file size shrink significantly. 
There is still some wasted space around the interface 
itself. In this next tutorial you will find out how to 
animate in the smallest possible space and make it 
appear as part of a larger image. This is a great way to 
add some interest to a web page.

3: Animating portions of an 
image 
• 
It's possible to take what we have learned in this 
chapter and take a large image and animate portions of 
it. This gives the impression that the entire image is 
• animated. but really only carefully selected portions are. 
This will involve a bit of trickery, as our image will push 
lmageReady beyond its programming and we'll have to 
fool it a bit. Don't worry though. I'll take you step-by-
• step through the whole process. 
1 have stripped down one of my 100% Photoshop 
creations for this tutorial. The Image is called Alien 
animation.psd. Open this file now. 
l have the Station itself as the matte. layer 0 is the 
background. We'll animate a shooting star through the 
• windows (Star layer). We also have a layer set called TV. 
This set contains the TV screens. We are going to 
animate some static on two of the screens. 
You'll see four layers called noise. 
Creating the static is easy. I simply 
made a selection the size of the TV 
screens, made new layers and ran 
a Noise filter on them (Filter > 
oise > Add 
oi e). I made two 
noise layers for each screen. By 
making a two-frame animation 
between the two noise layers, it 
will give the illusion of TV static. 
•••• 
• ••• 
This is what the finished animation will look like with 
the TV static and the shooting star moving in through 
the windows. 
Defining the slices 
1. 
The first thing we need to do is define the areas 
that will be animated. We will do this with slices. 
Make a slice around each of the TV screens. 
2. 
Using the Slice tool. make a slice along the bottom 
part of the window. We have now defined the 
three animation zones. The rest of the image will 
be static except for these three areas. The 
challenge we have is that lmageReady only has 
one Animation palette and no timeline. This 
means that it can only create one animation per 
image by default. We're going to be cunning here 
and make lmageReady think we're creating 
rollovers. thus we can use the rollover states to 
create new animations. Then we're going to swap 
out the rollover images and make the animation 
the default image. This may sound confusing, but 
all will become clear as we work through the 
example.

Drag the star all the way across to the right-hand 
side of the image, until it is just off the canvas. 
Remember to hold the SHIFT key. This will ensure 
that our animation follows a smooth horizontal

11. Test the animation and the shooting star should 
now travel across the screen . 
12. The animation is looping and the 
shooting star is constantly moving. 
Set a delay time of 10 seconds to 
the last frame. This will cause it to 
pause at the end of the animation 
before looping.

13. Let's animate the TV screens now. Select one of 
the screens with the Slice Select tool. You'll notice 
that the Animation palette still contains the star 
animation. This is the problem we were talking 
about earlier. Here comes the workaround. Don't 
you just love pushing a program beyond its 
natural capabilities?!

to the TV slice in the 
Rollovers palette (Alien

Over State. You'll see the

empty now, all ready for 
us to use to prepare our 
second animation. 
15. Notice that the TV slice now has a small icon next 
to the slice number to indicate that there is a 
rollover attached.

16. Select the noise 1 layer in the Layers palette and 
make sure it is visible. Then create a new frame in 
the Animation palette. 
17. Now hide the noise 
layer and show the noise 
2 layer. That's it! The 
static animation is set 
up. 
18. Repeat the same steps for the second TV slice.

19. In the Optimize palette, define each slice as a 
JPEG, except for our three animation zones, which 
you should set to GIF. This will ensure that only 
the three slices will be animated as it's impossible 
to attach an animation to a JPEG. Take note of the 
slice names of our three zones now, they're 3. 5 
and 9. If yours are different write them down now. 
We'll use this information in a minute. 
20. Click the 'Preview in Default Browser' icon. You'll 
see an alert message saying lmageReady will save 
only currently selected frames for the J PEG 
images. That is exactly what we wanted -
otherwise the entire page would be animated. This 
trick will force lmageReady to animate only our 
three zones. Click OK. 
Be sure that the three slices we want to animate 
are not in the list (mine were 3, 5, and 9). If you 
see them there, then you have made a mistake 
somewhere and need to backtrack and fix it. 
21. You can now preview the animation in your web 
browser. 
You'll notice t hat the screens will only animate when 
the mouse rolls over them. This is not a surprise 
because we created the animations on the rollover 
state. 
Remember how rollovers work? One image swaps to 
another image on mouse activity. This means that there 
is an animated GIF somewhere that shows on rollover. 
Actually there is an animated GIF for each of the three 
zones. The shooting star is fine because it's running by 
default. What we need to do is swap the static images 
on the TV screens for the animated GIFs.

We're going to do this in two ways. The first method will 
be for those of you who know some HTML. The second 
method will be for those of you who are afraid of code. 
Choose the method that best suits you. 
22. No matter what method you use, you will need to 
save the image and its HTML page. Go to File > 
Save Optimized As. Choose a directory and you 
will see an HTML document and a folder with 
images. Let's make our modification so that all the 
animations will run simultaneously. 
Method 1 - Changing the code 
If you use Dreamweaver, Golive, Frontpage or some 
other HTML editor, just swap out the images in the 
tables using those programs. If you want to do some 
quick HTML hand-coding, follow along. 
1. 
Open the HTML document in Notepad, or 
Simple Text.

2. 
Look for the table. It will be between the <TABLE> 
tags. 
3. 
Now look for the table cell <'I'D> that contains our 
first slice alien-animation 03. 
4. 
We're 
looking for 
<IMG 
NAME="alien-
animation_03" 
SRC= "images/alien-
animation_03, gif"Width=76 
HEIGHT=57 
BORDER=O>. This is the only code needed to 
display our image. All the other code between the 
<'I'D> tags refers to the rollover. We'll need to 
locate the name of the rollover image. It's alien-
animation-over .gif (our 
animated 
gif). 
Image Ready adds the ' -over' to all the rollover 
images. 
5. 
All we need to do is replace the IMG 
SRC= 
(target) with the animated GIF and then delete 
all the redundant code for this table cell, leaving 
only our animated GIF behind.

Save the page as alien-animation2 .html. It's always 
a good idea to save a copy of a page after you have 
altered the code. This way you can revert to the original 
version if the modified page doesn't work correctly. Test 
the page in the browser. One of the TVs should now be 
animated as well as the shooting star. If you have an 
error, go back and check the code again carefully. 
9. 
Now do the same thing for the second TV screen 
on the same page we just saved. This code method 
is the cleanest way to modify the animations. 
Method 2- Switch image names 
This second method requires no coding. We're going to 
replace the static image with the animated GIF by 
renaming. 
1. 
Open the Images folder. You'll f ind alien-
animation_os .gif and alien-animation_os-

the rollover will show no image.

5. 
To correct that. rename alien-animation_os-
old.gif to alien-animation_OS-over .gif. 
We have effectively switched out the two images. 
When the mouse rolls over the screen the static 
will stop and the screen will clear. This is a great 
way to create buttons for your web page - the 
name of your link could be on the screen. 
If you want to maintain the static all the time, 
make two copies of the animated G/F and name 
them alien-animation_05-over.gif and 
alien-animation_ OS .gif. 
6. 
Repeat the renaming for the second TV screen. 
7. 
Launch your page in the web browser and watch 
all three animations run together.

"The camera never lies." Very true. but with Photoshop we can 
'bend the truth' a little. In fact, it's possible to modify and 
doctor any image. We can break the laws of physics and defy 
gravity. For example, here's an image of a car that I modified to 
make it look like it's hovering: 
In this chapter we're going to work with photos and produce 
some interesting results. These techniques will come in useful 
for preparing advertising, web page design and just plain old 
fun.

1 Extracting an ·mage rom the 
Before you can make the most of these modifications, 
you'll need to learn how to extract an image from its 
background. Photoshop ships with a useful tool called 
the Extract tool. I'm now going to show you a quick 
no-nonsense way to use it. 
Begin with the image 
you want to pull from 
the background. Here 
I've 
used 
a 
surfer 
(28019. jpg). You can 
use any image -
the 
technique is exactly the 
same. 
Make a copy of the layer 
and hide the original 
Background layer. This 
technique will discard 
the background and it 
always pays to keep a 
copy just in case. I can't 
emphasize it enough, 
always keep an original 
of everything! 
Launch the Extract filter by selecting Filter > 
Exira ct. 
Here's how the Extract filter works: you highlight the 
outline of the image that you want to extract, and then 
it does its magic. Using the average colors on the 
outline, Extract will try to decide what is foreground 
and what is background and discard the background. 
This tool works very well and can even isolate individual 
hairs. Now to walk through it. 
Select the Edge Highlighter tool. 
This image has sharp 
edges, so make the 
brush size smaller. You 
would use a larger 
brush size for softer 
areas such as fur and 
hair. I'll explain more 
in the next step. 
-
... _ -· 
--e--
_ 
.. 
Begin to highlight the edges, but before going too 
far, read the tips below. 
Extract will look at the highlighted edge as the 
'deciding zone'. This is where it will decide to 
keep or discard - so obviously, the thinner the 
line the sharper the extract. Make sure the entire 
edge is covered. A larger brush size will make a 
larger 'deciding zone' and is useful for softer 
more complex extraction. Now that you know 
that, the edge I've used here is too large: 

There's a feature called Smart Highlighting. You 
can check it on in the menu if you wish but I 
prefer this method: when you hold down the 
CTRL/CMo key while drawing, Extract will 
temporarily turn on the Smart Highlighting 
mode. Extract will attempt to find the edges and 
produce a thinner line right on it. 
Using the tips above. highlight the entire outline 
of the image. 
~ -··---.... ------
(> 
"' . 
There's no way that Extract would know which 
part of the image you want to keep and which 
part you want to discard. It's smart, but it still can't 
read your mind. So, select the Paint Bucket tool 
and mark the area you want to keep by clicking 
inside the area. It will fill with blue (by default -
you can change it). 
PHOTO MANIPULATION 
Click OK. You'll now be returned to your 
Photoshop document, without its background. 
It's 
looking 
pretty 
good. but not perfect. 
Use the Eraser tool to 
delete any stragglers 
you may see. 
IIIN9 «..too. ....... ,_,. .... , •. ~ 
---------
1 
In some cases there are parts extracted that you 
may want to keep, like the missing parts on our 
subject's left forearm - he may want them! Select 
the History Brush from the toolbox. 
Open the History palette and 
choose a history state to 
paint with. This 
is like 
painting an undo to any 
point in the palette. Choose 
the state just before the 
Extract. Check the box next 
to the desired state and you 
should see an icon of a brush 
and an arrow.

Using small brush sizes. paint 
the lost parts back in. You may 
want to zoom into the image for 
more detail. 
After a little work. here's the 
final image: 
You can now drag and drop it onto any background you 
choose. 
2: Adding a person to a 
Now that we know how to extract a person, let's look at 
some techniques to make a convincing photo 
manipulation. 
There's another option for extracting your images. 
Hemera 
Technologies 
have 
a 
product 
called 
PhotoObjects. These surprisingly affordable collections 
contain thousands of images that have already been 
extracted. Look on the CD for 1 00 free sample images. 
1 
For this example we'll be using one of the 
PhotoObject images on the disk called: woman 
model 3 .psd. Open it up now. 
We'll also be using a website that I made for a fictitious 
band called Hazardous Waste. They want to advertise 
the new site in a magazine, so we're going to create the 
ad. 
The images here are 72ppi for learning purposes. 
In the real world, you would use 300ppi for a 
print od. 
Open waste_site.psd from the CD. 

Using Free Transform (CTRL/(Mo+ n. right-click 
and choose Distort. 
Drag the corners and distort the page to make it 
appear as if it's tilted in space as shown. 
Fill the background with white. Drag the image of 
the model into the document. 
if you hold the SHIFT key while dragging into a 
new document. your item will be automatically 
centered. 
Resize and position the model so that it looks like 
she's sitting on the page. 
PHOTO MANIPULATION 
Now we need to add 
something to tie t he two 
images 
together 
and 
make it believable. A cast 
shadow will be perfect. 
Duplicate the model layer, 
but leave the duplicate 
layer alone and return to 
Layer 2 to apply the 
shadow. Make a selection 
of the model and fill the 
selection with black. 
" 
~11.y·iiooH • 
Still on Layer 2, once again use Free Transform. 
Choose Distort again. 
Drag the top part of the shadow to make it appear 
as though it's cast across the page at the same 
angle as the web page. Press the ENTER key to 
apply.

A real shadow is soft and fades the further it gets 
from the subject. Go to Filter > Blur > Gaussian 
Blur .... I like to use a setting of 5 to soften the 
edges of a cast shadow. 
C...uni.Jn lllu~ 
Now the edges are looking better. Lower the opacity to 
63% 
1 
Let's fade the shadow so that it loses intensity the 
further it gets from the model. Click the 'Add layer 
mask' icon to add a mask to the shadow layer. 
Choose the Gradient tool, and select the default 
colors (press the D key). Use the foreground to 
background linear gradient. 
1 
Drag the gradient from the middle of the shadow 
and upwards until you are about an inch off the 
top. You should get a result like the one shown. If 
not. just keep reapplying the gradient until you're 
satisfied with the result. 
1 
You may need to reduce the opacity on the 
shadow layer to suit your tastes and your 
background. 
1 
Finally add some type and you're done. A nice 
clean typeface will look good; in this case I've used 
Impact. When you have an eye-catching image, 
sometimes it's good to use a simple typeface. This 
helps to avoid an overly busy image, which 
confuses the eye and gives it nowhere to rest. 
IW-IIIIIIII.CIIII 

A good magazine ad should be clean, with 
impact to catch the attention, but without 
overwhelming the senses. Look at the ads that 
are really busy with lots of images and type on 
them, do you really think they can get their 
message across in one glance? No. A good ad 
will already have delivered its message before 
the reader has even decided whether to read it 
or not. 
3: Combining two imag s 
together and making it look 
Look at these steps. Imagine how much it would cost to 
hire a stuntman to jump off them on a motorcycle. 
Then take the costs of a photographer with a quick eye 
to capture the moment. We'll save some money and 
perhaps a few bruises with this tutorial.

Open the steps image 
on 
the 
CD 
that 
you 
want to 
add 
the motorcycle to,

Now open the Hemera image coup l e

PHOTO MANIPULATION 
Drag the motorcycle image into the base image. 
Resize, position and 
rotate to make it look 
like we're jumping off 
the steps. 
A big part of combining images is making the 
tones match. I recently saw a big Hollywood 
movie with some scenes that looked so fake 
because the shadow tones didn't match on the 
foreground and background images. I was 
thinking, just adjust the tone curve and this 
would look 300% more real. 
With the motorcycle layer selected, open the 
'Curves' dialog box (Image > Adju tmenls > 
Curves ... ). 
Adjust the curve to make the images fit better 
together. Left is shadows and right is highlights. 
Pull up to brighten and down to darken anywhere 
on the tone curve.

Another dead giveaway is when the saturation 
doesn't match on the two images. Saturation is 
the intensity of the color. An under-saturated 
image looks like it has faded in the sun, whereas 
an over-saturated image looks too fake and 
plastic. Notice that the motorcycle appears 
more saturated than the base image. 
Go to Image > Adjustments> Hue/Saturation ... to 
open the dialog box. Move the 'Saturation' slider 
to the left to lower the color saturation of the 
selected layer until it matches the background 
image. 
Other things to watch for include: 
• 
Film grain - If the grains don't match it will 
look doctored. The fix for that is to add 
some noise to the lowest grain image. 
• 
lighting -
Make sure that the lighting is 
coming from the same angle. Carefully 
added shadows can fix that, as you're about 
to see. 
• 
Wind direction - This is easy to overlook. 
Imagine trees blowing one way and an 
umbrella bursting open the in opposite 
direction. 
• 
There may be other little things too. Examine 
your image carefully and look for things that 
are out of place, such as reflections, 
perspective, ambient lighting and so on. 
Let's add a little bit of a blur to the motorcycle to 
imply movement. Duplicate the motorcycle layer. 
On the duplicated layer 
add a motion blur by 
selecting Filter > Blur > 
Motion Blur.... Adjust 
the angle to match the 
movement 
direction. 
Make sure to move 
the 
blurred 
layer 
underneath the original 
motorcycle layer. 
Drag the blurred layer 
to the left so that it 
trails the image. 
I lowered the opacity 
to 38% to make the 
blur a little more 
subtle. One of the 
keys to realism is 
subtlety.

We'll now add the drop shadow to make it look 
like the motorcycle is occupying space in the same 
image as the steps. Duplicate the motorcycle layer 
and select the copy. Rename it 'shadow', and 
rename the other layers more intuitively while 
you're at it! Drag the shadow layer below the cycle 
layer. 
With a selection of the motorcycle generated, fill 
the shadow layer with black.

Deselect and then add 
the 5-pixel blur by 
going to Filter > Blur> 
Gaussian Blur... and 
entering

the 
'Radius' box.

Drag the shadow underneath the image, until it's 
cast on the steps. 
PHOTO MANIPULATION 
We now have a drop shadow, 
but it needs some work to 
make it look realistic. If 
you've ever watched the way 
a shadow 'creeps' on steps 
you'll know what I mean. 
Hide the motorcycle layer for now. Choose the 
shadow layer. 
Drag a selection across the part of the shadow 
that extends above the steps. We're going to 
remove the shadow from this region. (Note: If the 
image was front lit, then keeping the shadow on 
the background portion would be okay, but 
looking at the existing shadows on the image we 
can determine that the sun's position is above and 
to the right.)

Make a selection of the shadow from the top step 
face, downwards. 
Move the shadow to the right just a little. 
We could move everything one segment at a time, 
but here's a quicker way. Make a selection on the 
top of the next step down using the Polygonal 
Lasso tool. 
Holding down the SHIFT key (to add to selection), 
select the tops of the rest of the steps. 
Press CTRLICMo+ T to open the 'Free Transform' 
dialog box. 
Right-click and press Skew. We're going to distort 
the shadow on the tops of the steps to make it 
look like the shadow is actually wrapping on the 
steps and not just pasted on. 
Drag the mouse to 
the left so that the 
shadow is falling 
in the opposite 
direction to the 
sun angle. 
Click OK to apply. Don't deselect yet. Press 
CrRLICMo+SHIFT+J to move the selected pixels to 
their own layer (Layer > 
ew > Layer via Cut). 
Rename the new layer 'shadow 2'. Deselect now. 
We now have a rough shadow. All that's left is to 
soften the shadow and blend it in to make it look 
realistic.

layer. 
Add a 3.2-pixel 
Gaussian Blur.

Also apply the same blur to the shadow layer. 
To reapply the previous filter with the same 
settings, press CrRLICMo+F- be sure to select the 
other shadow layer first. 
Lower the opacity of 
the shadow layer to 
50%. 
PHOTO MANIPULATION 
Lower the opacity of 
the shadow 2 layer to 
77%. The reason we 
made this higher is 
because shadows will 
appear to fall darker 
directly on 
top of 
objects. 
Turn the motorcycle 
layer 
back 
on

admire your handiwork. 
Doesn't the shadow 
add a lot to the image? 
Carefully

together. 
I'm sure you've had fun in this chapter. Photo 
manipulation is one of the most fun things in 
Photoshop. You've also learnt some good principles of 
image matching and photo manipulation. Use these 
techniques for all kinds of images. 
You've learned how to weld parts of images together 
and create very realistic-looking shadows. You've also 
learned a number of things to watch out for when 
combining images and some techniques to counter 
them 
and 
produce 
believable-looking 
photo 
manipulations. 
Photo manipulation is a very important Photoshop skill 
to possess. I actually picked up a lot of my illustration 
techniques this way.

Isn't it fascinating how objects appear to distort through lenses, 
glass and gel? This chapter is going to show you how to produce 
some popular and requested transparency effects. We're not 
only going to create the lenses, we're going to distort the 
background behind them.

1: Magnifying glass 
In this tutorial we are going to create a magnifying glass 
and then cause it to interact with the background 
behind it. 
1. 
Start with this background image that I prepared 
earlier, or use your own. You'll find my file on the 
CD as Backgronnd.psd. 
2. 
Create a new layer called 
'ring'. This is where we're 
going 
to 
build 
our 
magnifying glass. 
3. 
Using the Elliptical Marquee tool. create a circle 
and fill it with white. Make it as large as you want 
the lens to be. I've made it just under half of the 
image height. 
Hold down the 
SHIFT 
key 
to 
constrain to a 
perfect circle. 
4. 
Let's turn the circle into 
a ring. Go to Select > 
Modify > Contract and 
choose a Contract By 
value of 10 pixels. 
The selection has now contracted. 
5. 
Press the DELETE key 
to delete the center. 
6. 
CTRt/CMD-click on 
the layer thumbnail 
to select the entire 
ring. 
7. 
Select the Gradient tool, set it for a linear gradient 
and choose the copper gradient preset. 
200 
: ...................................................................................................................... . 

Drag the gradient across the ring to make it 
appear more metallic. 
9. 
Let's add some depth to the ring. Add a bevel as 
shown. Pay special attention to the gloss contour, 
depth and size sliders. Getting just the right 
balance between these three is the secret to great 
looking bevels .

The key to successful image development is the ability 
to think ahead. I think being a chess player helps me in 
Photoshop - you always have to be thinking several 
steps ahead in order to make the right combination of 
moves. 
We'll need a drop shadow on the magnifying glass at 
some point. But if we were to just add a layer style, 
when we distort the background the drop shadow 
wouldn't distort. 
We'll plan ahead: 
1. 
Make the magnifying glass one object. 
2. 
Create the drop shadow on a separate 
layer. 
3. 
Isolate the section of the shadow to be 
distorted. 
4. 
Merge the section of the shadow with the 
section of the background to be distorted. 
5. 
Distort the area of background inside the 
lens including the shadow. 
OK. time for the walk through. 
14. Link the handle and ring 
layers together. 
15. Click the arrow at the top 
right and choose Merge 
Linked. The 
magnifying 
glass is now one object. The 
reason we have done this is 
so that we can create a 
single drop shadow. 
16. Duplicate the handle layer 
and select the bottom one. 
17. CTRLICMD-click the handle layer to load the 
selection and fill the bottom magnifying glass with 
black. 
18. Deselect and move the shadow down and to the 
left.

We now have a magnifying glass frame with a drop 
shadow. Right now it looks like there is no glass in the 
lens - we'll correct that now. 
Creating the lens 
1. 
Link the magnifying glass and the shadow. Place 
the glass right where you want the background to 
show through the lens.

2. 
Select the handle copy layer. Using the Magic 
Wand tool, make sure 'use all layers' is deselected, 
and select the space in the center of the lens. 
3. 
We now need to make a copy of the background 
inside the lens. Choose the background layer and 
press CTRLICMo+J to copy the selection to a new 
layer. Name this 'Layer 1' if it isn't already. 
4. 
Now 
to 
separate 
the 
shadow inside the lens 
from the 
rest of the 
shadow. Load the circular 
selection 
again. 
The 
quickest way to do this is 
to CTRLICMo-click on Layer 
1. Then select the handle 
layer. 
5. 
Press (TRLICMo+SHiFT+J to 
cut the selection to a new 
layer (Layer > New > Layer

the shadow to two layers. 
Name 
this 
new 
layer 
'shadow in glass'.

don't touch anything is because the fade option is 
only available immediately after applying a filter. 
Once you have done anything else this option is 
no longer available. What we want to do here is 
just apply the light effect of the lens flare without 
the color effect.

2: Water and liquid metal drops 
This tutorial is a progressive tutorial. A lot of the steps 
are the same for the water and the metal. This tutorial 
is unique in that we will follow a path and then split it 
near the end and produce both water and metal drops. 
We'll then step out a little bit and turn the water into 
blood.

In this chapter you have learned about transparency 
and how it interacts with its surroundings. You've 
learned how to distort backgrounds to match the 
curves of the lenses. You have also learned how to add 
color in a translucent way instead of just flat color. 
Using this technique, you will add a lot of realism to 
your images. You can now create images with more 
depth and the appearance of "another dimension." 
Try these techniques to add a bit of interest to products 
shots, or ads. Imagine what you could do to a brochure 
for an aquarium or a magazine ad for a scuba diving 
product. You could even just go crazy and create a 
totally surrealistic image just for fun or to attract 
attention to your design .

I wish I had a dollar for every time I've been asked how 
to blend two images together. This tutorial will 
demonstrate how to blend two images with the 
gradient mask. Then we'll take it further and take total 
control of the masks.

the CD. (You can use any 
image in RGB mode for 
this background.) 
Open bike sprocket 5. psd from the CD and 
drag it into the main image. 
Resize the sprocket image to fit. using CTRLICMD+ T 
and holding down SHIFT while resizing to keep its 
proportions the same. 
Click the 'Add 
layer 
mask' icon at the bottom 
of the Layers palette. 
Reset the palette colors to default by hitting D on 
your keyboard and choose the Gradient tool. 
• • • •••••••••
In the options toolbar, choose 'foreground to 
background' and 'linear'. 
Drag the Gradient tool across the image, ensuring 
that you're in the layer mask and not painting on 
the image. 
Notice how the image 
smoothly 
blends 
to 
transparent. I will now 
explain how this works 
and offer a couple of 
steps 
to 
further 
illustrate this to you. 
Solid 
understanding 
and control of layer 
masks is paramount in 
good collage design. 
When a new mask is applied to an image it doesn't 
seem to have any effect initially 
What's happening is this - imagine that the layer is a 
picture projected on the wall like, say, a slide. As long as 
there is nothing blocking the path of the light, the 
picture will be displayed. All of a sudden, someone 
jumps up in front of you and begins to make animal 
hands on the screen. The hand is blocking the light and 
therefore casting a black shape on the screen, which is 
really an absence of light. 

Layer masks are like the hands in front of the projector. 
Except, where a mask is blocked it will not show a black 
shadow, instead, it will hide the layer's contents and 
reveal whatever is underneath that layer. Also, the mask 
is not simply either on or off, it can show 256 levels of 
transparency. Each level of transparency is controlled by 
a level of gray applied to the mask. 
When a mask is applied to a layer, by default it's titled 
with white. White has no effect on the layer. However, 
black would make the layer totally transparent. 
Needless to say that each level of gray will produce a 
different degree of transparency. 50% gray would 
produce 50% transparency. 
Now look at the gradient we just made. Notice the mask 
has a grayscale gradient, which matches the faded 
blend on the layer. You can also selectively paint away 
or restore parts of the layer by using a brush on the 
layer mask. 
Let's restore part of the image. 
Choose a soft brush of 1 OOpx 
and 
make 
white 
the 
foreground color. Remember 
that white will make the layer 
1 00% opaque (provided we're 
painting at 1 00%).

Select the layer mask and paint with the white 
brush. See the image begin to return?

Now swap the foreground color for black (hit X). 
We'll now demonstrate the opposite effect.

Paint in the bottom part of the sprocket and 
notice the image begin to fade. 
All right! Hopefully you have a better understanding of 
layer masks now. Let's continue with the collage. 
Open cyclis t 8. psd from 
the CD. (Both this picture and 
the sprocket are from Hemera 
Images) 
Drag the image of the cyclist into the main picture 
and resize to suit your tastes. 
Notice how the sprocket is now competing with the 
cyclist image. Let's make the composition balance a bit 
more.

Lower the opacity of the 
sprocket layer to 73%. 
Notice how the sprocket is 
now blended back and yields 
its attention to the cyclist 
who is really the main focus 
of this design. 
Color is very useful, not just as a communication tool, 
but also to bring together different elements and make 
them fit together tightly. A good example is the popular 
use of monotone collage images. I'll show you how to 
do this in one easy step, and then we'll selectively 
colorize a portion of the collage to bring attention to it. 
At the bottom of the Layers palette is the 'Create 
new fill or adjustment layer' icon. Click on this and 
choose Hue/Saturation.

You'll now see a dialog box like this. Click Colorize

Adjust the Hue to move to other colors. Use the 
Saturation slider to add stronger color or to 
subdue it. I think you can figure out the Lightness 
on your own. 
Here is our collage with the 
Hue/Saturation 
adjustment 
layer. It now looks like it all 
belongs together:

I said earlier that I'd show you how to selectively 
colorize. We'll colorize the bicycle only. Notice 
that the adjustment layer comes with its own layer 
mask as a standard feature. Well, this mask works 
exactly like a regular layer mask, except this time 
we're not fading an image, but an effect. Click on 
the mask. 

Choose a black brush. 
Begin to paint and notice 
t hat the color begins to 
come back. Wait! Don't 
paint the entire bike in 
yet. Can you think of an 
easier way? Remember 
the bicycle was a clipped 
image and therefore it 
has transparency. Have 
you figured it out yet? 
CTRLICMo-click 
on 
the 
bike layer to load its 
transparency mask. 
Now you can paint the bike back in easily without 
having to worry about going over the lines. 
If you're having trouble 
with this step, make 
sure that you're still 
painting on the layer 
mask of the adjustment 
layer. 
Add some type and this could be the cover of a 
brochure.

Here's an extra little tip. At anytime (even after 
you've closed and reopened the file) double-click 
the adjustment layer and the 'Hue/Saturation'

One of the hottest things out right now is the grunge 
brush effect. This is partly due to the fact that digital 
images are too perfect and people have been looking 
for ways to make them more down to earth and natural 
looking. I'll show you how to create your own brushes 
and enhance (or should that be 'dehance'?) your 
images. 
Create a new document (this is where we'll create 
our brush). Make it 60 x 60 pixels at 72ppi with a 
white background.

are no rules here. Each brush should be unique.

photographic edges too. Hopefully this effect gives you 
some good ideas of how to make your work look a bit

In the previous book, the design projects were very popular. 
However, I knew that these could have been better if AI and I 
were sitting in the same room when we wrote them. So I got on 
a plane and flew to Montana. Currently, I am sitting in Al's office 
in Montana. It's exciting to see what is coming out of this. 
I am going to kick this one off by creating a shape, well a shell, 
of an interface. We're going to pass it back and forth on a zip 
drive and see what comes out. As an added feature this time, 
we thought of saving each round as a PSD and putting it on the 
CD so that you can jump in at any time and put your own twist 
on the co-op project.

,. 
Let's begin with a new document. making use of 
the preset sizes in Photoshop 7. Choose '800x600' 
and 'RGB Color' mode. I always work in RGB over 
CMYK mode because the file size is smaller, all the 
filters will work and the color gamut is larger 
(more vivid colors). Choose 'Transparent' for the 
contents; this will create a new document with no 
background. 
We're now going to use the Pen tool to draw a shape. 
The Pen tool is the best option because it draws the 
cleanest paths in Photoshop. The paths are drawn in 
vector format. which ensures a level of flexibility and 
scalability that is not possible with pixels. 
To draw a vector shape, choose the 
Pen tool from the toolbox. In the 
Options bar, select 'Shape layers', the 
first option on the left. This will create 
a filled path that will be turned into a 
vector shape. The second option 
would create just a path. 
The Pen tool may seem a little daunting at first, but gets 
easier with practice. If you are going to master 
Photoshop you have to learn the Pen tool at some 
point. For Illustrator users, the Pen tool in Photoshop 
performs exactly the same way. 
Let's take a quick look at Bezier curves. which are 
created by the Pen tool. There are three elements you 
need to be aware of: 
• 
Anchor points. These are the points that 
you add to your drawing; these are the dots 
used in "join the dots". Actually we just draw 
the dots and Photoshop will join them for 
us. 
• 
Handles. These are the line segments that 
extend beyond the dots. These are how we 
control the way the dots are joined. They 
can be set to make a curve between the 
points or straight lines. 
• 
Closing points. When we want to close a 
path, a small circle will appear when the 
mouse hovers over the start/finish anchor 
point. 
Closin7 
There are two ways to draw. If you just click and 
them click elsewhere a straight line will be 
drawn between the two points. If you click and 
drag, an adjustment handle will appear 
indicating that you are now creating a curve. 
The curve will be created with the radius and 
direction of the drag. 
Enough of the theory, let's actually do it now. 
(Don't forget. you can open the finished shape 
from the CD, it's called shapel.psd.) There are 
many methods to produce the result we are 
looking for; I've chosen the following method 
because it's the quickest way with the least steps 
to produce an abstract shape for our intended 
purposes. Click and drag downwards; notice the 
handle begins to appear: 

Move your cursor to the right. and click and drag 
downwards again. Notice that you've created a 
curved section, and that as you drag you'll see the 
curve increase. Experiment with different lengths 
and angles, and try dragging up and down before 
you release the mouse button. In a normal path, 
you could select each of these handles and adjust 
the shape after you've completed the path. You 
can also move the anchor points later. 
Click a third time. You will see a filled region now 
because we have more than two points. Note: the 
fill will always be the selected foreground color. If 
we had chosen the second option on the top 
toolbar, you wouldn't see a filled region. 
Keep clicking around the page perimeter until you 
have completed our rough shape. 
DESIGN PROJECT I

Once the path is complete you'll be left with a 
shape layer. A shape layer is somewhat like a type 
layer in that it has very limited flexibility. Just like 
we have rasterized text layers, and converted 
them to regular layers, we will now Rasterize the 
shape layer. 
Create a new layer and link the new layer with the 
shape layer. Choose Merge linked from the fly 
out menu at the top right of the Layers palette. 
You'll now be able to make selections, trim and 
add to the shape. Using the Rectangular Marquee 
tool, make a selection across the top of the shape, 
then press the DELETE key to trim the shape.

How about an area for a screen in our interface? 
Use the Rectangular Marquee tool again and draw 
a selection.

Press the DELETE key to cut out the screen. Next, 
choose the Elliptical Marquee tool and cut out a 
circle so we can add another component later. 
223 

PHOTOSHOP MOST WANTED 2 
224 
Keep trimming with the marquee tools. Also, use 
the Polygonal Lasso tool to draw irregular shapes. 
The arrow keys on the keyboard can be used to 
nudge the selection without moving the image's 
pixels. 
Finally we have our shape. Lots of holes and 
shapes will give us great flexibility to add gadgets 
to our interface. 
CTRLICMo-click on the layer thumbnail. This loads 
the selection of our layer. 
We're now going to create an Alpha channel and 
copy our shape into it. From there we can use this 
as a base to add depth to our image. Open the 
Channels palette and click the 'Create new 
channel' icon. The new channel will be called 
'Alpha 1'. Click on the Alpha 1 channel. Don't 
deselect yet. 
You'll have noticed that there is already a 
channel called 'Shape 7 Mask'. This is because 
we're using a shape layer. We could just skip a 
few steps and use this channel. However, we'll 
continue so that you know the procedure for 
times when you're not using a shape layer and 
want to produce the same result.

The content of the Alpha channel is now displayed 
in the image window. You should see the marching 
ants selections around t he shape. 
If you 
accidentally deselected you can just choose Select 
> Reselect or res elect your shapes using the Magic 
Wand tool, set to a low tolerance with the 
Contiguous box checked. 
Fill the selection 
with white. 
Hit ( TRLICMO-BACKSPACE 
to fill a selection with 
the background color. 
Don't deselect yet. We're currently creating a 
'map' just like I showed you in the 3D chapter. 
Filter > Blur > Gaussian Blur. Use a setting of 7.5. 

Our map is now ready 
for use. Click on the 
RGB channel in the 
Channels palette. This 
restores the display to 
the default composite 
display. 
Return to the Layers 
palette. Create a new 
layer and 
name it 
'shape'.

the 
Shape 1 layer. 
If you deselected, load the selection by CTRL/CMo-

Almost instantly. your effect is applied to your layer. I 
still get a kick out of the way this filter adds so much 
depth to a shape. At this point, I'm going to pass the 
shape over to Al and see what he does with it. 
We have a good foundation for something ... though 
neither of us is quite certain as of yet what will come of 
this. Looking at the shape, it appears to be some sort of 
interface, so that gives us a lot to go on really. Now. 
what type of interface will it be? 
For this round, I'm going to start by adding some 
character and variation to the hues on the faceplate. 
Select the shape layer. 
CTRL/CMo-click the shape 
layer in the Layers palette 
to generate a selection of 
the shape. 
Click the 'Create a new layer' icon on the bottom 
of the Layers palette. A new layer named Layer 1 
will be created just above the shape layer. 
In the toolbox, select the Gradient tool. Set the 
following attributes for a copper gradient in the 
options bar. Note that the Mode has been set to 
Difference; this will have a big impact on the 
effect.

Fill the selection in the new layer with the gradient 
three times, each time coming from a different 
direction. The aim is for the gradient to be as rich 
and non-uniform as possible. On the third pass 
the majority of the layer will be primarily copper 
toned still, with a few other color variations in 
blue and violet. 

That looks interesting, but I don't want to totally 
cover 
all 
of

Hit

Finally, before I send it back to Al, I've added some text 
to the buttons and also to the interface itself. What 
manufacturer wouldn't put a label on their product? 
We're coming down to the wire now ... only a few touch 
ups are really needed. First. we can deal with that open 
bar at the bottom of the interface, just below the view 
screen. 
Open the iface layer set 
and select the shape 
layer. 
Select the Magic Wand tool and click the wand 
inside the open area to generate a selection. 
Create a new layer above the shape layer. 
Select the Gradient tool and load in the PSW2-
Metall.grd gradient. In the options bar, set the 
following attributes for the Gradient tool: 
Starting at the top of the selection, draw the 
gradient down to the bottom of the selection. 
The space has taken a metallic aspect due to the 
gradient used. However, we aren't really looking 
for a metal fill for the space. Go to Image > 
Adjustments > Brightness/Contrast. Enter the 
following settings in the 'Brightness/Contrast'

that is a little harsh.

Now we have a status bar of some sort. I'm not sure of 
its function, but it looks good on the interface, so it 
must do something, right? 
The last item I can think that this contraption needs is 
an antenna. 
Create a new layer

That's about it! Let's send it to Colin one more time for 
any finishing touches he would like to add . 
We're looking really good now. I don't think it needs 
much more. The only thing I can see is that the top 
section is looking a bit plain. I think we will add a vent 
to it and call it a finished project. 
Select the Line tool for the toolbox and choose 
white as the foreground color. Make the 'Weight' 
1 pixel. 
Create a new layer and call it 'vents'. Draw a line 
across the top of the interface. 
To make the line look 
recessed we'll duplicate 
it, invert it and move it 
1 pixel. Duplicate the 
layer by dragging it to 
the 'Create a new layer'

Design Project II 
For the second design project. we decided to do a print job. A 
book cover seems like the order of the day, specifically a cover 
for this book. While the actual cover of the book will vary. it will 
be good for you to have a rare glimpse into the creative process 
and see how an image evolves and changes as it's shaped into 
something that we, the designers. feel happy about. You'll also 
learn a couple of things about the world of designing for print. 
Notice that some of the effects we apply will be changed later.

1. 
The first thing we need to do is create the new 
canvas. Eight by ten inches is a pretty standard size 
for magazines and coffee table books. The 
resolution must be 300ppi for print. The printing 
press requires a much higher resolution than a 
screen display. As such, the file size will be larger. 
The empty file will be 20 megabytes and quickly 
increase as we add layers. You'll want to optimize 
your computer to produce large files - here are a 
few tips: 
• 
You can never have too much RAM. 
• 
Clear the hard drive of unneeded files. The 
more free space you have, the better 
Photoshop will run because it uses the free 
space as 'temporary RAM'. or what's known 
as the Scratch Disk. 
• 
Optimize your hard drive by running a 
defragmentation program. These are built 
into system tools if you're on a PC, or use 
Norton Speed disk on a Mac. 
• 
Crop your images to the size needed. just 
because you can't see it. it doesn't mean it's 
not there. 
• 
Work in RGB mode and only convert to 
CMYK at the end -this will keep the file size 
approximately a quarter smaller. 
2. 
Create some text. Here I used Futura Extra Black 
at a SO point size. If you don't have Futura, Arial is 
very similar. 
PIIOTOSIIOP 
3. 
Now create the second line in a different font for 
impact. I also set this one at SO points. The second 
font I used is a freeware font called Planet 
Kosmos 
available 
for 
download 
at 
w ww. themeworl d.com/fon ts/i ndex PS .shtm I. 
I made the word "most" a mid-gray color to make 
it a bit more eye catching. 
4. 
I decided to make the 
"2" very large. 242 pts. 
Contrast in type is a 
great attention grabber. 
I dragged the "2" under 
the smaller text to help 
readability. 
5. 
I then added the author names. I copied the color 
scheme and the font from the title so that the 
design would have some unity. Even though the 
new text is smaller, at 33 pts, it still ties in with the 
existing text. A big mistake would be using a 
different italic font. The other font may use a 
different angle and as such. spoil the flow of lines 
on the page.

I've added a strip across the center of the page. I 
made a new layer for the strip. It's a good idea to 
put most things on their own layer for a project 
like this, it will give you more flexibility to change 
things later. This is where the images will be 
placed. I think we have a pretty good foundation 
for a clean layout. I'll now hand it over to Al. 
As always, it looks like Colin has a good start on things. 
You know me though - I simply can't allow those fonts 
to go untouched. To start, let's dress up the biggest font 
on the page - the number "2"

Hey, I really like what Colin did with t he bar. I see he's

to the text. Hit CTRL/CMo+C to copy the selection.

effect to the text. The only thing I see I want to change 
is the inside of the 'most' text. 1 will change the color to 
match the color on t he "2" . 
80. Since AI was kind enough 
to keep the layer style 
intact, it will be really 
easy to change the color. 
Expand t he layer styles on 
the text layer. Find the 
color overlay effect and 
double click it.

Filter > Noise > Add 
oise... Choose Gaussian 
for the distribution, as this 
gives a more random 
effect than uniform. Move 
the 
amount 
to 
the 
maximum. 
87. Now blur the globe layer with the noise added.

DESIGN PROJECT II 
142. Duplicate the hexagon several times and arrange 
on the page. Here's our final cover: 
When designing for a client. it's standard practice to 
offer more than one idea for review. This design may be 
a bit 'busy' for some people's taste, so I removed the 
textures on the page and kept a cleaner black for the 
front. I also moved some of the shapes to balance the 
design a bit more. Once you're happy with the design 
you'll need to make a copy, merge all the layers and 
convert it to CMYK mode for printing. Save the file as a 
TIF or EPS file. You could either send it to the printers 
as an image file, or drop it into lnDesign, Quark or 
Pagemaker for output. 
Summary 
I hope you've enjoyed these tutorials and learned a lot. 
I also hope you've had as much fun with these design 
projects as Al and I have in creating them. We wish you 
the best with your experimenting with the techniques 
you've learnt. Remember, be patient and keep 
practicing and you'll keep getting better as a designer. 
Some people are born with talent, but no one has 
produced excellent designs without practice. I'd also 
encourage you to visit www.photoshopcafe.com and 
www.actionfx.com regularly for more resources 
and 
ideas, 
and 
don't 
forget 
to 
drop 
by 
www.friendsofed.com to see a listing of the latest 
books available, take part in the forums, and read 
interviews with top designers. With a combination of 
good learning resources and practice, you're on the 
• 
right road to producing some stunning designs!
