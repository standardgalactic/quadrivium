Abstract
In this paper we compare the performance of descriptors computed for local interest regions, as for
example extracted by the Harris-Afﬁne detector [32]. Many different descriptors have been proposed in
the literature. However, it is unclear which descriptors are more appropriate and how their performance
depends on the interest region detector. The descriptors should be distinctive and at the same time robust
to changes in viewing conditions as well as to errors of the detector. Our evaluation uses as criterion
recall with respect to precision and is carried out for different image transformations. We compare
shape context [3], steerable ﬁlters [12], PCA-SIFT [19], differential invariants [20], spin images [21],
SIFT [26], complex ﬁlters [37], moment invariants [43], and cross-correlation for different types of
interest regions. We also propose an extension of the SIFT descriptor, and show that it outperforms the
original method. Furthermore, we observe that the ranking of the descriptors is mostly independent of
the interest region detector and that the SIFT based descriptors perform best. Moments and steerable
ﬁlters show the best performance among the low dimensional descriptors.

recognition [21], image retrieval [29, 38], robot localization [40], video data mining [41], building
panoramas [4], and recognition of object categories [8, 9, 22, 35]. They are distinctive, robust
to occlusion and do not require segmentation. Recent work has concentrated on making these
descriptors invariant to image transformations. The idea is to detect image regions covariant to a
class of transformations, which are then used as support regions to compute invariant descriptors.
Given invariant region detectors, the remaining questions are which is the most appropriate
descriptor to characterize the regions, and does the choice of the descriptor depend on the region
detector. There is a large number of possible descriptors and associated distance measures which
emphasize different image properties like pixel intensities, color, texture, edges etc. In this work
we focus on descriptors computed on gray-value images.
The evaluation of the descriptors is performed in the context of matching and recognition
of the same scene or object observed under different viewing conditions. We have selected a
number of descriptors, which have previously shown a good performance in such a context and
compare them using the same evaluation scenario and the same test data. The evaluation criterion
is recall-precision, i.e. the number of correct and false matches between two images. Another
possible evaluation criterion is the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) in the context of
image retrieval from databases [6, 31]. The detection rate is equivalent to recall but the false
positive rate is computed for a database of images instead of a single image pair. It is therefore
difﬁcult to predict the actual number of false matches for a pair of similar images.
Local features were also successfully used for object category recognition and classiﬁcation.
The comparison of descriptors in this context requires a different evaluation setup. However, it
is unclear how to select a representative set of images for an object category and how to prepare
the ground truth, since there is no linear transformation relating images within a category. A
possible solution is to select manually a few corresponding points and apply loose constraints
to verify correct matches, as proposed in [18].
In this paper the comparison is carried out for different descriptors, different interest regions
and for different matching approaches. Compared to our previous work [31], this paper performs
a more exhaustive evaluation and introduces a new descriptor. Several descriptors and detectors
have been added to the comparison and the data set contains a larger variety of scenes types
and transformations. We have modiﬁed the evaluation criterion and now use recall-precision for
image pairs. The ranking of the top descriptors is the same as in the ROC based evaluation [31].

Furthermore, our new descriptor, gradient location and orientation histogram (GLOH), which is
an extension of the SIFT descriptor, is shown to outperform SIFT as well as the other descriptors.
A. Related work
Performance evaluation has gained more and more importance in computer vision [7]. In the
context of matching and recognition several authors have evaluated interest point detectors [14,
30, 33, 39]. The performance is measured by the repeatability rate, that is the percentage of points
simultaneously present in two images. The higher the repeatability rate between two images, the
more points can potentially be matched and the better are the matching and recognition results.
Very little work has been done on the evaluation of local descriptors in the context of matching
and recognition. Carneiro and Jepson [6] evaluate the performance of point descriptors using ROC
(Receiver Operating Characteristics). They show that their phase-based descriptor performs better
than differential invariants. In their comparison interest points are detected by the Harris detector
and the image transformations are generated artiﬁcially. Recently, Ke and Sukthankar [19] have
developed a descriptor similar to the SIFT descriptor. It applies Principal Components Analysis
(PCA) to the normalized image gradient patch and performs better than the SIFT descriptor on
artiﬁcially generated data. The criterion recall-precision and image pairs were used to compare
the descriptors.
Local descriptors (also called ﬁlters) have also been evaluated in the context of texture
classiﬁcation. Randen and Husoy [36] compare different ﬁlters for one texture classiﬁcation
algorithm. The ﬁlters evaluated in this paper are Laws masks, Gabor ﬁlters, wavelet transforms,
DCT, eigenﬁlters, linear predictors and optimized ﬁnite impulse response ﬁlters. No single
approach is identiﬁed as best. The classiﬁcation error depends on the texture type and the
dimensionality of the descriptors. Gabor ﬁlters were in most cases outperformed by the other
ﬁlters. Varma and Zisserman [44] also compared different ﬁlters for texture classiﬁcation and
showed that MRF perform better than Gaussian based ﬁlter banks. Lazebnik et al. [21] propose
a new invariant descriptor called “spin image” and compare it with Gabor ﬁlters in the context of
texture classiﬁcation. They show that the region-based spin image outperforms the point-based
Gabor ﬁlter. However, the texture descriptors and the results for texture classiﬁcation cannot be
directly transposed to region descriptors. The regions often contain a single structure without
repeated patterns, and the statistical dependency frequently explored in texture descriptors cannot

be used in this context.
B. Overview
In section II we present a state of the art on local descriptors. Section III describes the
implementation details for the detectors and descriptors used in our comparison as well as our
evaluation criterion and the data set. In section IV we present the experimental results. Finally,
we discuss the results.
II. DESCRIPTORS
Many different techniques for describing local image regions have been developed. The
simplest descriptor is a vector of image pixels. Cross-correlation can then be used to compute a
similarity score between two descriptors. However, the high dimensionality of such a description
results in a high computational complexity for recognition. Therefore, this technique is mainly
used for ﬁnding correspondences between two images. Note that the region can be sub-sampled
to reduce the dimension. Recently, Ke and Sukthankar [19] proposed to use the image gradient
patch and to apply PCA to reduce the size of the descriptor.
Distribution based descriptors. These techniques use histograms to represent different charac-
teristics of appearance or shape. A simple descriptor is the distribution of the pixel intensities
represented by a histogram. A more expressive representation was introduced by Johnson and
Hebert [17] for 3D object recognition in the context of range data. Their representation (spin
image) is a histogram of the relative positions in the neighborhood of a 3D interest point. This
descriptor was recently adapted to images [21]. The two dimensions of the histogram are distance
from the center point and the intensity value.
Zabih and Woodﬁll [45] have developed an approach robust to illumination changes. It relies
on histograms of ordering and reciprocal relations between pixel intensities which are more robust
than raw pixel intensities. The binary relations between intensities of several neighboring pixels
are encoded by binary strings and a distribution of all possible combinations is represented by
histograms. This descriptor is suitable for texture representation but a large number of dimensions
is required to build a reliable descriptor [34].
Lowe [25] proposed a scale invariant feature transform (SIFT), which combines a scale invari-
ant region detector and a descriptor based on the gradient distribution in the detected regions. The

descriptor is represented by a 3D histogram of gradient locations and orientations, see ﬁgure 1
for illustration. The contribution to the location and orientation bins is weighted by the gradient
magnitude. The quantization of gradient locations and orientations makes the descriptor robust
to small geometric distortions and small errors in the region detection. Geometric histogram [1]
and shape context [3] implement the same idea and are very similar to the SIFT descriptor. Both
methods compute a 3D histogram of location and orientation for edge points where all the edge
points have equal contribution in the histogram. These descriptors were successfully used, for
example, for shape recognition of drawings for which edges are reliable features.
Spatial-frequency techniques. Many techniques describe the frequency content of an image.
The Fourier transform decomposes the image content into the basis functions. However, in
this representation the spatial relations between points are not explicit and the basis functions
are inﬁnite, therefore difﬁcult to adapt to a local approach. The Gabor transform [13] overcomes
these problems, but a large number of Gabor ﬁlters is required to capture small changes in
frequency and orientation. Gabor ﬁlters and wavelets [27] are frequently explored in the context
of texture classiﬁcation.
Differential descriptors. A set of image derivatives computed up to a given order approximates
a point neighborhood. The properties of local derivatives (local jet) were investigated by Koen-
derink [20]. Florack et al. [11] derived differential invariants, which combine components of
the local jet to obtain rotation invariance. Freeman and Adelson [12] developed steerable ﬁlters,
which steer derivatives in a particular direction given the components of the local jet. Steering
derivatives in the direction of the gradient makes them invariant to rotation. A stable estimation of
the derivatives is obtained by convolution with Gaussian derivatives. Figure 2(a) shows Gaussian
derivatives up to order 4.

to describe the multi-spectral nature of the image data. The invariants combine central moments

acterize shape and intensity distribution in a region
6 . They are independent and can be easily
computed for any order and degree. However, the moments of high order and degree are sensitive
to small geometric and photometric distortions. Computing the invariants reduces the number of
dimensions. These descriptors are therefore more suitable for color images where the invariants
can be computed for each color channel and between the channels.
III. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
In the following we ﬁrst describe the region detectors used in our comparison and the region
normalization necessary for computing the descriptors. We then give implementation details for
the evaluated descriptors. Finally, we discuss the evaluation criterion and the image data used
in the tests.
A. Support regions
Region detectors use different image measurements and are either scale or afﬁne invariant.
Lindeberg [23] has developed a scale-invariant “blob” detector, where a “blob” is deﬁned by a
maximum of the normalized Laplacian in scale-space. Lowe [25] approximates the Laplacian
with difference-of-Gaussian (DoG) ﬁlters and also detects local extrema in scale-space. Lindeberg
and G˚arding [24] make the blob detector afﬁne-invariant using an afﬁne adaptation process based
on the second moment matrix. Mikolajczyk and Schmid [29, 30] use a multi-scale version of the
Harris interest point detector to localize interest points in space and then employ Lindeberg’s
scheme for scale selection and afﬁne adaptation. A similar idea was explored by Baumberg [2]
as well as Schaffalitzky and Zisserman [37]. Tuytelaars and Van Gool [42] construct two types
of afﬁne-invariant regions, one based on a combination of interest points and edges and the
other one based on image intensities. Matas et al. [28] introduced Maximally Stable Extremal
Regions extracted with a watershed like segmentation algorithm. Kadir et al. [18] measure the
entropy of pixel intensity histograms computed for elliptical regions to ﬁnd local maxima in
afﬁne transformation space. A comparison of state-of the art afﬁne region detectors can be
found in [33].
1) Region detectors: The detectors provide the regions which are used to compute the de-
scriptors. If not stated otherwise the detection scale determines the size of the region. In this
evaluation we have used ﬁve detectors :

Harris points [15] are invariant to rotation. The support region is a ﬁxed size neighborhood of
41x41 pixels centered at the interest point.
Harris-Laplace regions [29] are invariant to rotation and scale changes. The points are detected
by the scale-adapted Harris function and selected in scale-space by the Laplacian-of-Gaussian
operator. Harris-Laplace detects corner-like structures.
Hessian-Laplace regions [25, 32] are invariant to rotation and scale changes. Points are localized
in space at the local maxima of the Hessian determinant and in scale at the local maxima of
the Laplacian-of-Gaussian. This detector is similar to the DoG approach [26], which localizes
points at local scale-space maxima of the difference-of-Gaussian. Both approaches detect the
same blob-like structures. However, Hessian-Laplace obtains a higher localization accuracy in
scale-space, as DoG also responds to edges and detection is unstable in this case. The scale
selection accuracy is also higher than in the case of the Harris-Laplace detector. Laplacian scale
selection acts as a matched ﬁlter and works better on blob-like structures than on corners since
the shape of the Laplacian kernel ﬁts to the blobs. The accuracy of the detectors affects the
descriptor performance.
Harris-Afﬁne regions [32] are invariant to afﬁne image transformations. Localization and scale
are estimated by the Harris-Laplace detector. The afﬁne neighborhood is determined by the afﬁne
adaptation process based on the second moment matrix.
Hessian-Afﬁne regions [32, 33] are invariant to afﬁne image transformations. Localization and
scale are estimated by the Hessian-Laplace detector and the afﬁne neighborhood is determined
by the afﬁne adaptation process.
Note that Harris-Afﬁne differs from Harris-Laplace by the afﬁne adaptation, which is applied
to Harris-Laplace regions. In this comparison we use the same regions except that for Harris-
Laplace the region shape is circular. The same holds for the Hessian based detector. Thus the
number of regions is the same for afﬁne and scale invariant detectors. Implementation details
for these detectors as well as default thresholds are described in [32]. The number of detected
regions varies from 200 to 3000 per image depending on the content.
2) Region normalization: The detectors provide circular or elliptic regions of different size,
which depends on the detection scale. Given a detected region it is possible to change its
size or shape by scale or afﬁne covariant construction. Thus, we can modify the set of pixels
which contribute to the descriptor computation. Typically, larger regions contain more signal

variations. Hessian-Afﬁne and Hessian-Laplace detect mainly blob-like structures for which the
signal variations lie on the blob boundaries. To include these signal changes into the description,
the measurement region is 3 times larger than the detected region. This factor is used for all
scale and afﬁne detectors. All the regions are mapped to a circular region of constant radius
to obtain scale and afﬁne invariance. The size of the normalized region should not be too
small in order to represent the local structure at a sufﬁcient resolution. In all experiments this
size is arbitrarily set to 41 pixels. A similar patch size was used in [19].
Regions which are
larger than the normalized size, are smoothed before the size normalization. The parameter
7
of
the smoothing Gaussian kernel is given by the ratio measurement/normalized region size. Spin
images, differential invariants and complex ﬁlters are invariant to rotation. To obtain rotation
invariance for the other descriptors the normalized regions are rotated in the direction of the
dominant gradient orientation, which is computed in a small neighborhood of the region center.
To estimate the dominant orientation we build a histogram of gradient angles weighted by the
gradient magnitude and select the orientation corresponding to the largest histogram bin, as
suggested in [25].
Illumination changes can be modeled by an afﬁne transformation

of the pixel
intensities. To compensate for such afﬁne illumination changes the image patch is normalized
with mean and standard deviation of the pixel intensities within the region. The regions, which
are used for descriptor evaluation, are normalized with this method if not stated otherwise.
Derivative-based descriptors (steerable ﬁlters, differential invariants) can also be normalized by
computing illumination invariants. The offset
9
is eliminated by the differentiation operation.
The invariance to linear scaling with factor
5 is obtained by dividing the higher order derivatives
by the gradient magnitude raised to the appropriate power. A similar normalization is possible
for moments and complex ﬁlters, but has not been implemented here.
B. Descriptors
In the following we present the implementation details for the descriptors used in our experi-
mental evaluation. We use ten different descriptors: SIFT [25], gradient location and orientation
histogram (GLOH), shape context [3], PCA-SIFT [19], spin images [21], steerable ﬁlters [12],
differential invariants [20], complex ﬁlters [37], moment invariants [43], and cross-correlation of
sampled pixel values. Gradient location and orientation histogram (GLOH) is a new descriptor

which extends SIFT by changing the location grid and using PCA to reduce the size.
SIFT descriptors are computed for normalized image patches with the code provided by Lowe [25].
A descriptor is a 3D histogram of gradient location and orientation, where location is quantized
into a 4x4 location grid and the gradient angle is quantized into 8 orientations. The resulting
descriptor is of dimension 128. Figure 1 illustrates the approach. Each orientation plane represents
the gradient magnitude corresponding to a given orientation. To obtain illumination invariance,
the descriptor is normalized by the square root of the sum of squared components.
Gradient location-orientation histogram (GLOH) is an extension of the SIFT descriptor designed
to increase its robustness and distinctiveness. We compute the SIFT descriptor for a log-polar
location grid with 3 bins in radial direction (the radius set to 6, 11 and 15) and 8 in angular
direction (cf. ﬁgure 1(e)), which results 17 location bins. Note that the central bin is not divided
in angular directions. The gradient orientations are quantized in 16 bins. This gives a 272 bin
histogram. The size of this descriptor is reduced with PCA. The covariance matrix for PCA is
estimated on 47 000 image patches collected from various images (see section III-C.1). The 128
largest eigenvectors are used for description.

(4 in angular direction).
Shape context is similar to the SIFT descriptor, but is based on edges. Shape context is a 3D
histogram of edge point locations and orientations. Edges are extracted by the Canny [5] detector.
Location is quantized into 9 bins of a log-polar coordinate system as displayed in ﬁgure 1(e)
with the radius set to 6, 11 and 15 and orientation quantized into 4 bins (horizontal, vertical and
two diagonals). We therefore obtain a 36 dimensional descriptor. In our experiments we weight
a point contribution to the histogram with the gradient magnitude. This has shown to give better

results than using the same weight for all edge points, as proposed in [3]. Note that the original
shape context was computed only for edge point locations and not for orientations.
PCA-SIFT descriptor is a vector of image gradients in

and

direction computed within the
support region. The gradient region is sampled at 39x39 locations therefore the vector is of
dimension 3042. The dimension is reduced to 36 with PCA.
Spin image is a histogram of quantized pixel locations and intensity values. The intensity of a
normalized patch is quantized into 10 bins. A 10 bin normalized histogram is computed for each
of 5 rings centered on the region. The dimension of the spin descriptor is 50.

Steerable ﬁlters and differential invariants use derivatives computed by convolution with Gaus-
sian derivatives of

;<>= for an image patch of size 41. Changing the orientation of derivatives
as proposed in [12] gives equivalent results to computing the local jet on rotated image patches.
We use the second approach. The derivatives are computed up to 4th order, that is the descriptor
has dimension 14. Figure 2(a) shows 8 of 14 derivatives; the remaining derivatives are obtained
by rotation by
?@BA . The differential invariants are computed up to 3rd order (dimension 8).
We compare steerable ﬁlters and differential invariants computed up to the same order (cf.
section IV-A.3).

Rotation changes the phase but not the magnitude of the response, therefore we use the modulus
of each complex ﬁlter response.
Moment invariants are computed up to 2nd order and 2nd degree. The moments are computed

directions. This results in a 20-dimensional descriptor (2x10 without

 
YZY ). Note that
originally moment invariants were computed on color images [43].
Cross correlation. To obtain this descriptor the region is smoothed and uniformly sampled. To
limit the descriptor dimension we sample at 9x9 pixel locations. The similarity between two
descriptors is measured with cross-correlation.
Distance measure. The similarity between descriptors is computed with the Mahalanobis distance
for steerable ﬁlters, differential invariants, moment invariants and complex ﬁlters. We estimate
one covariance matrix
[
for each combination of descriptor/detector ; the same matrix is used
for all experiments. The matrices are estimated on images different from the test data. We
used 21 image sequences of planar scenes which are viewed under all the transformations for
which we evaluate the descriptors. There are approximately 15 000 chains of corresponding
regions with at least 3 regions per chain. An independently estimated homography is used
to establish the chains of correspondences (cf. section III-C.1 for details on the homography
estimation). We then compute the average over the individual covariance matrices of each chain.
We also experimented with diagonal variance matrices and nearly identical results were obtained.
The Euclidean distance is used to compare histogram based descriptors, that is SIFT, GLOH,
PCA-SIFT, shape context and spin images. Note that the estimation of covariance matrices for
descriptor normalization differs from the one used for PCA. For PCA, one covariance matrix is
computed from approximately 47 000 descriptors.
C. Performance evaluation
1) Data set: We evaluate the descriptors on real images with different geometric and photo-
metric transformations and for different scene types. Figure 3 shows example images of our data
set1 used for the evaluation. Six image transformations are evaluated: rotation (a) & (b); scale

change (c) & (d); viewpoint change (e) & (f); image blur (g) & (h); JPEG compression (i); and
illumination (j). In the case of rotation, scale change, viewpoint change and blur, we use two
different scene types. One scene type contains structured scenes, that is homogeneous regions
with distinctive edge boundaries (e.g. grafﬁti, buildings) and the other contains repeated textures
of different forms. This allows to analyze the inﬂuence of image transformation and scene type
separately.
Image rotations are obtained by rotating the camera around its optical axis in the range of
30 and 45 degrees. Scale change and blur sequences are acquired by varying the camera zoom
and focus respectively. The scale changes are in the range of 2-2.5. In the case of the viewpoint
change sequences the camera position varies from a fronto-parallel view to one with signiﬁcant
foreshortening at approximately 50-60 degrees. The light changes are introduced by varying the
camera aperture. The JPEG sequence is generated with a standard xv image browser with the
image quality parameter set to 5%. The images are either of planar scenes or the camera position
was ﬁxed during acquisition. The images are therefore always related by a homography (plane
projective transformation).
The ground truth homographies are computed in two steps. First,
an approximation of the homography is computed using manually selected correspondences.
The transformed image is warped with this homography so that it is roughly aligned with the
reference image. Second, a robust small baseline homography estimation algorithm is used to
compute an accurate residual homography between the reference image and the warped image,
with automatically detected and matched interest points [16]. The composition of the approximate
and residual homography results in an accurate homography between the images.
In section IV we display the results for image pairs from ﬁgure 3. The transformation
between these images is signiﬁcant enough to introduce some noise in the detected regions. Yet,
many correspondences are found and the matching results are stable. Typically, the descriptor
performance is higher for small image transformations but the ranking remains the same. There
are few corresponding regions for large transformations and the recall-precision curves are not
smooth.
A data set different from the test data was used to estimate the covariance matrices for PCA
and descriptor normalization. In both cases we have used 21 image sequences of different planar

scenes which are viewed under all the transformations for which we evaluate the descriptors2.
2) Evaluation criterion: We use a criterion similar to the one proposed in [19]. It is based
on the number of correct matches and the number of false matches obtained for an image pair.

of false matches. The value of
c is varied to obtain the curves. The results are presented with
recall versus 1-precision. Recall is the number of correctly matched regions with respect to the
number of corresponding regions between two images of the same scene:

error is computed numerically. Our approach counts the number of pixels in the union and the
intersection of regions. Details can be found in [33]. We assume that a match is correct if the
error in the image area covered by two corresponding regions is less than 50% of the region
union, that is
uv`{@
<> . The overlap is computed for the measurement regions which are used to
compute the descriptors. Typically, there are very few regions with larger error that are correctly
matched and these matches are not used to compute the recall. The number of correspondences
(possible correct matches) are determined with the same criterion.
The number of false matches relative to the total number of matches is represented by 1-
precision.

 . Note that recall and 1-precision
are independent terms. Recall is computed with respect to the number of corresponding regions
and 1-precision with respect to the total number of matches.
Before we start the evaluation we discuss the interpretation of ﬁgures and possible curve
shapes. A perfect descriptor would give a recall equal to 1 for any precision. In practice,
recall increases for an increasing distance threshold, as noise which is introduced by image
transformations and region detection increases the distance between similar descriptors. Hor-
izontal curves indicate that the recall is attained with a high precision and is limited by the
speciﬁcity of the scene i.e. the detected structures are very similar to each other and the descriptor
cannot distinguish them. Another possible reason for non-increasing recall is that the remaining
corresponding regions are very different from each other (partial overlap close to 50%) and
therefore the descriptors are different. A slowly increasing curve shows that the descriptor is
affected by the image degradation (viewpoint change, blur, noise etc.). If curves corresponding to
different descriptors are far apart and have different slopes, then the distinctiveness and robustness
of the descriptors is different for a given image transformation or scene type.
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In this section we present and discuss the experimental results of the evaluation. The perfor-
mance is compared for afﬁne transformations, scale changes, rotation, blur, jpeg compression and
illumination changes. In the case of afﬁne transformations we also examine different matching
strategies, the inﬂuence of the overlap error and the dimension of the descriptor.
A. Afﬁne transformations
In this section we evaluate the performance for viewpoint changes of approximately

@ degrees.
This introduces a perspective transformation which can locally be approximated by an afﬁne
transformation. This is the most challenging transformation of the ones evaluated in this paper.
Note that there are also some scale and brightness changes in the test images, see ﬁgure 3(e)(f).
In the following we ﬁrst examine different matching approaches. Second, we investigate the

inﬂuence of the overlap error on the matching results. Third, we evaluate the performance for
different descriptor dimensions. Fourth, we compare the descriptor performance for different
region detectors and scene types.

is the GLOH descriptor computed for Hessian-Laplace regions (cf. section IV-A.4).
1) Matching strategies: The deﬁnition of a match depends on the matching strategy. We
compare three of them. In the case of threshold based matching two regions are matched if the
distance between their descriptors is below a threshold. A descriptor can have several matches
and several of them may be correct. In the case of nearest neighbor based matching two regions

]
are matched if the descriptor
^a
is the nearest neighbor to
^_
and if the distance
between them is below a threshold. With this approach a descriptor has only one match. The third
matching strategy is similar to nearest neighbor matching except that the thresholding is applied
to the distance ratio between the ﬁrst and the second nearest neighbor. Thus, the regions are
matched if


,^_
G
^bjXc where
^ba
is the ﬁrst and
^
is the second nearest
neighbor to
^b_ . All matching strategies compare each descriptor of the reference image with
each descriptor of the transformed image.
Figure 4(a)(b)(c) shows the results for the three matching strategies. The descriptors are
computed on Hessian-Afﬁne regions. The ranking of the descriptors is similar for all matching
strategies. There are some small changes between nearest neighbor matching (NN) and matching
based on the nearest neighbor distance ratio (NNDR). For low false positive rates in ﬁgures 4(a)
and (b) PCA-SIFT obtains better scores than SIFT. In ﬁgure 4(c), which shows the results for
NNDR, SIFT is signiﬁcantly better than PCA-SIFT, whereas GLOH obtains a score similar to
SIFT. Cross correlation and complex ﬁlters obtain slightly better scores than for threshold based
and nearest neighbor matching. Moments perform as well as cross correlation and PCA-SIFT
in the NNDR matching (cf. ﬁgure 4(c)).
The precision is higher for the nearest neighbor based matching (cf. ﬁgure 4(b) and (c))
than for the threshold based approach (cf. ﬁgure 4(a)). This is because the nearest neighbor is
mostly correct, although the distance between similar descriptors varies signiﬁcantly due to image
transformations. Nearest neighbor matching selects only the best match and rejects all the others
below the threshold therefore there are less false matches and the precision is high. Matching
based on nearest neighbor distance ratio is similar but additionally penalizes the descriptors
which have many similar matches, i.e. the distance to the nearest neighbor is comparable to the
distances to other descriptors. This further improves the precision. The nearest neighbor based
techniques can be used in the context of matching, however they are difﬁcult to apply when
descriptors are searched in a large database. The distance between descriptors is then the main
similarity criterion. The results for distance treshold based matching reﬂect the distribution of
the descriptors in the space, we therefore use this method for our experiments.
2) Region overlap: In this section we investigate the inﬂuence of the overlap error on the
descriptor performance. Figure 5(a) displays recall with respect to overlap error. To measure the
recall for different overlap errors we ﬁx the distance threshold for each descriptor such that the

precision is 0.5. Figure 5(b) shows the number of correct matches obtained for a false positive
rate of 0.5 and for different overlap errors.
The number of correct matches as well as the number of correspondences is computed for a
range of overlap errors, i.e. the score for 20% is computed for an overlap error larger that 10% and
lower than 20%. As expected the recall decreases with increasing overlap error (cf. ﬁgure 5(a)).
The ranking is similar to the previous results. We can observe that the recall for cross correlation
drops faster than for other high dimensional descriptors, which indicates lower robustness of this
descriptor to the region detector accuracy. We also show the recall for GLOH combined with
scale invariant Hessian-Laplace detector (hes-lap gloh). The recall is zero up to an overlap
error of 20 % as there are no corresponding regions for such small errors. The recall increases
to 0.3 at 30% overlap and slowly decreases for larger errors. The recall for hes-lap gloh
is slightly above the others because the large overlap error is mainly caused by size differences
in the circular regions, unlike for afﬁne regions where the error also comes from the afﬁne
deformations which signiﬁcantly affect the descriptors.
Figure 5(b) shows the actual number of correct matches for different overlap errors. This
ﬁgure also reﬂects the accuracy of the detector. The bold line shows the number of corresponding
regions extracted with Hessian-Afﬁne. There are few corresponding regions with an error below

10%, but nearly 90% of them are correctly matched with the SIFT based descriptors, PCA-
SIFT, moments and cross correlation (cf. ﬁgure 5(a)). Most of the corresponding regions are
located in the range of 10% and 60% overlap errors, whereas most of the correct matches are
located in the range 10% to 40%. In the following experiments the number of correspondences
is counted between 0% and 50% overlap error. We allow for 50% error because the regions with
this overlap error can be matched if they are centered on the same structure, unlike the regions
which are shifted and only partially overlapping. If the number of detected regions is high, the
probability of an accidental overlap of two regions is also high, although they may be centered
on different image structures. The large range of allowed overlap errors results in a large number
of correspondences which also explains low recall.
3) Dimensionality: The derivatives-based descriptors and the complex ﬁlters can be computed
up to an arbitrary order. Figure 6(a) displays the results for steerable ﬁlters computed up to 3rd
and 4th order, differential invariants up to 2nd and 3rd order and complex ﬁlters up to 2nd
and 6th order. This results in 5, 9 dimensions for differential invariants; 9, 14 dimensions for
steerable ﬁlters; 9, 15 dimensions for complex ﬁlters. We used the test images from ﬁgure 3(e)
and descriptors are computed for Hessian-Afﬁne regions. Note that the vertical axes in ﬁgure 6
are scaled. The difference between steerable ﬁlters computed up to 3rd and up to 4th order is
small but noticeable. This shows that the 3rd and 4th order derivatives are still distinctive. We
can observe a similar behavior for different orders of differential invariants and complex ﬁlters.
Steerable ﬁlters computed up to 3th order perform better than differential invariants computed
up to the same order. The multiplication of derivatives necessary to obtain rotation invariance
increases the instability.
Figure 6(b) shows the results for high dimensional, region-based descriptors (GLOH, PCA-
SIFT and cross correlation). The GLOH descriptor is computed for 17 location bins and 16
orientations and the 128 largest eigenvectors are used (gloh - 128). The performance is
slightly lower if only 40 eigenvectors are used (gloh - 40) and much lower for all 272
dimensions (gloh - 272). A similar behavior is observed for PCA-SIFT and cross correlation.
Cross correlation is evaluated for 36, 81, and 400 dimensions, i.e. 6x6, 9x9 and 20x20 samples
and results are best for 81 dimensions (9x9). Figure 6(b) shows that the optimal number of
dimensions in this experiment is 128 for GLOH, 36 for PCA-SIFT and 81 for cross correlation.
In the following we use the number of dimensions which gave the best results here.

Evaluation for different descriptor dimensions. Test images are from ﬁgure 3(e) and descriptors are computed for

Table I displays the sum of the ﬁrst 10 eigenvalues and the sum of all eigenvalues for the
descriptors. These eigenvalues result from PCA of descriptors normalized by their variance. The
numbers given in table I correspond to the amount of variance captured by different descriptors,
therefore to their distinctiveness. PCA-SIFT has the largest sum, followed by GLOH, SIFT and
the other descriptors. Moments have the smallest value. This reﬂects the discriminative power of
the descriptors, but the robustness is equally important. Therefore, the ranking of the descriptors
can be different in other experiments.
4) Region and scene types: In this section we evaluate the descriptor performance for different
afﬁne region detectors and different scene types. Figures 7(a) and 7(b) show the results for the
structured scene with Hessian-Afﬁne and Harris-Afﬁne regions, and ﬁgures 7(c) and (d) for the
textured scene for Hessian-Afﬁne and Harris-Afﬁne regions respectively.
The recall is better for the textured scene (ﬁgure 7(c) and (d)) than for the structured one
(ﬁgures 7(a) and (b)). The number of detected regions is signiﬁcantly larger for the structured
scene, which contains many corner-like structures. This leads to an accidental overlap between
regions, therefore a high number of correspondences. This also means that the actual number
of correct matches is larger for the structured scene. The textured scene contains similar motifs,
however the regions capture sufﬁciently distinctive signal variations. The difference in perfor-
mance of SIFT based descriptors and others is larger on the textured scene which indicates that a

large discriminative power is necessary to match them. Note that the GLOH descriptor performs
best on the structured scene and SIFT obtains the best results for the textured images.
Descriptors computed for Harris-Afﬁne regions (see ﬁgure 7(d)) give slightly worse results
than those computed for Hessian-Afﬁne regions (see ﬁgure 7(c)). This is observed for both,
structured and textured scenes. The method for scale selection and for afﬁne adaptation is the
same for Harris and Hessian based regions. However, as mentioned in section III-A, the Laplacian
based scale selection combined with the Hessian detector gives more accurate results.
Note that GLOH descriptors computed on scale invariant regions perform worse than many
other descriptors (see hes-lap gloh and har-lap gloh in ﬁgure 7), as these regions and
therefore the descriptors are only scale and not afﬁne invariant.

We can observe that the performance of all descriptors is better than in the case of viewpoint

case of viewpoint changes the results are better for the textured images. However, the number
of corresponding regions is 5 times larger for Hessian-Laplace and 10 times for Harris-Laplace

GLOH descriptors computed on afﬁne invariant regions detected by Harris-Afﬁne (har-aff
gloh) and Hessian-Afﬁne (hes-aff gloh) obtain slightly lower scores than SIFT based
descriptors computed on scale invariant regions, but they perform better than all the other
descriptors, unlike on images with viewpoint changes (cf. ﬁgures 4 and 7). This is observed
for both structured and textured scenes. This shows that afﬁne invariant detectors can also be

To evaluate the performance for image rotation we used images with a rotation angle in the
range between 30 and 45 degrees. This represents the most difﬁcult case. In ﬁgure 9(a) we
compare the descriptors computed for standard Harris points detected on a structured scene
(cf. ﬁgure 3(a)). All curves are horizontal at similar recall values, i.e. all descriptors have a
similar performance. Note that moments obtain a low score for this scene type. The applied
transformation (rotation) does not affect the descriptors. The recall is below 1 because many
correspondences are established accidentally. Harris detector ﬁnds many points close to each
other and many support regions accidentally overlap due to the large size of the region (41
pixes).
To evaluate the inﬂuence of the detector errors we display the results for the GLOH descriptor
computed on Hessian-Afﬁne regions (hes-aff gloh). The performance is insigniﬁcantly
lower than for descriptors computed of ﬁxed size patches centered on Harris points. The number
of correct matches is higher for the afﬁne invariant detector. There are three types of error that

inﬂuence the descriptors computation: the region error, the localization error and the error of
the estimated orientation angle. In the case of standard Harris the scale and therefore the patch
size remains ﬁxed. The only noise comes from the inaccuracy of the localization and from
the angle estimation. We notice in ﬁgure 9(a) that these errors have less impact on descriptor
performance than the region error which occurs in the case of Hessian-Afﬁne. The error due to
the orientation estimation is small since the rotation invariant descriptors do not perform better
than the non-invariant ones.
Figure 9(b) presents the results for scanned text displayed in ﬁgure 3(b). The rank of the
descriptors changes. GLOH, SIFT and shape context obtain the best results. Moments, differential
invariants, cross correlation and complex ﬁlters fail on this example. The precision is low for
all the descriptors. The descriptors do not capture small variations in texture which results in
many false matches. GLOH descriptor computed on afﬁne invariant regions (hes-aff gloh)
performs well, i.e. lower than on Harris point, but better than most of the other descriptors.

scene and ﬁgure 10(b) for the textured scene. The images are displayed in ﬁgure 3(g) and (h),
respectively. Results are presented for regions detected with Hessian-Afﬁne. We also show the
results for GLOH computed on Harris-Afﬁne regions (har-aff gloh).
The results show that all descriptors are affected by this type of image degradation, although
there are no geometric transformations in these images. The pixel intensities and the shape
of local structures change in an unpredictable way and the descriptors are not robust to such
deformations. It is difﬁcult to model these deformations, therefore the comparisons on artiﬁcially
generated data are frequently overly optimistic.
GLOH and PCA-SIFT give the highest scores. The performance of shape context, which is
based on edges, decreases signiﬁcantly compared to geometric changes (sections IV-A and IV-B).
The edges disappear in the case of a strong blur.
GLOH computed on Harris-Afﬁne regions obtains a signiﬁcantly lower score than on Hessian-
Afﬁne regions. Blur has a larger inﬂuence on the performance of the Harris-Afﬁne detector than
on the performance of the Hessian-Afﬁne detector. Similar observations were made in [33].
The results for the textured scene (cf. ﬁgure 10(b)) are even more inﬂuenced by blurring. The
descriptors cannot distinguish the detected regions since blurring makes them nearly identical.
SIFT gives the largest number of matches in this scene. Cross-correlation obtains the lowest
score among the high dimensional descriptors but higher than low dimensional ones.
E. JPEG compression
In ﬁgure 11 we evaluate the inﬂuence of JPEG compression for a structured scene (cf.
ﬁgure 3(i)). The quality of the transformed image is 5% of the reference one. Results are
presented for regions detected with Hessian-Afﬁne.
The performance of descriptors is better than in the case of blur (cf. section IV-D), but worse
than in case of rotation and scale changes of structured scenes (cf. sections IV-C and IV-B). The
performance gradually increases with decreasing precision for all descriptors, i.e. all descriptors
are affected by JPEG artifacts. PCA-SIFT obtains the best score for a low false positive rate
and SIFT for a false positive rate above 0.2. The results for GLOH lie in between those two
descriptors.

F. Illumination changes
Figure 12 shows the results for illumination changes which have been obtained by changing
the camera settings. The image pair is displayed in ﬁgure 3(j). The descriptors are computed
for Hessian-Afﬁne regions. Figure 12(a) compares two approaches to obtain afﬁne illumination
invariance for differential descriptors : (i) based on region normalization (steerable fil-
ters and diff. invariant used in all our comparisons), (ii) based on the invariance of the
descriptors (invariant steerable filters and invariant differential in-
variants), see section III-A for details. We observe that the descriptors computed on normal-
ized regions are signiﬁcantly better. Theoretically, the two methods are equivalent. However, the
ratio of derivatives ampliﬁes the noise due to region and location errors as well as non-afﬁne illu-
mination changes. The importance of afﬁne illumination invariance is shown by the comparison
with descriptors which are not intensity normalized (not invariant steerable fil-
ters, not invariant differential invariants). These descriptors obtain worse
results. The score is not zero because these descriptors are based on derivatives which eliminate
the constant factor from the intensity.
In ﬁgure 12(b) the standard descriptors are compared in the presence of illumination changes.
All the descriptors are computed on normalized image patches. GLOH obtains the best matching
score. The same descriptor computed on Harris-Afﬁne regions obtains an equivalent score.

image respectively. There are 747 correspondences identiﬁed by the overlap criterion deﬁned in
section III-C. For the 400 nearest neighbor matches obtained with the GLOH descriptor, 192
are correct (displayed in yellow in ﬁgure 13) and 208 are false (displayed in blue).
Table II presents recall, false positive rate and the number of correct matches obtained with
different descriptors. These results are all based on a ﬁxed number of 400 nearest neighbor
matches. GLOH obtains the highest recall - 0.25, a slightly lower score is obtained by SIFT and
shape context. Complex ﬁlters achieve the lowest score - 0.06. The number of correct matches
vary from 192 to 44. There are approximately 4.4 times less correct matches for complex ﬁlters
than for GLOH. This clearly shows the advantage of SIFT-based descriptors.

V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we have presented an experimental evaluation of interest region descriptors
in the presence of real geometric and photometric transformations. The goal was to compare
descriptors computed on regions extracted with recently proposed scale and afﬁne-invariant
detection techniques. Note that the evaluation was designed for matching and recognition of
the same object or scene.
In most of the tests GLOH obtains the best results, closely followed by SIFT. This shows the
robustness and the distinctive character of the region-based SIFT descriptor. Shape context also
shows a high performance. However, for textured scenes or when edges are not reliable its score
is lower.
The best low dimensional descriptors are gradient moments and steerable ﬁlters. They can be
considered as an alternative when the high dimensionality of the histogram-based descriptors
is an issue. Differential invariants give signiﬁcantly worse results than steerable ﬁlters, which
is surprising as they are based on the same basic components (Gaussian derivatives). The
multiplication of derivatives necessary to obtain rotation invariance increases the instability.
Cross correlation gives unstable results. The performance depends on the accuracy of interest
point and region detection, which decreases for signiﬁcant geometric transformations. Cross
correlation is more sensitive to these errors than other high dimensional descriptors.
Regions detected by Hessian-Laplace and Hessian-Afﬁne are mainly blob-like structures. There
are no signiﬁcant signal changes in the center of the blob therefore descriptors perform better
on larger neighborhoods. The results are slightly but systematically better on Hessian regions
than on Harris regions due to their higher accuracy.
The ranking of the descriptors is similar for different matching strategies. We can observe that
SIFT gives relatively better results if nearest neighbor distance ratio is used for thresholding.
Note that the precision is higher for nearest neighbor based matching than for threshold based
matching.
Obviously, the comparison presented here is not exhaustive and it would be interesting to
include more scene categories. However, the comparison seems to indicate that robust region-
based descriptors perform better than point-wise descriptors. Correlation is the simplest region-
based descriptor. However, our comparison has shown that it is sensitive to region errors. It
would be interesting to include correlation with patch alignment which corrects for these errors

and to measure the gain obtained by such an alignment. Of course this is very time consuming
and should only be used for veriﬁcation.
Similar experiments should be conducted for recognition and classiﬁcation of object and
scene categories. An evaluation of the descriptors in the context of texture classiﬁcation and
classiﬁcation of similar local structures will be a useful and valuable addition to our work. This
would probably imply clustering of local structures based on the descriptors and an evaluation
of these clusters. It would be also interesting to compare the SIFT based descriptors in the
evaluation framework proposed in [21, 44].
