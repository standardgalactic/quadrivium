Introduction
1	 Introduction
Pressure driven membrane processes are widely used in the chemical, biochemical, pharmaceutical, 
food and dairy industries. A membrane process is capable of performing a certain separation by use of 
a membrane. The core in a membrane process is a membrane that allows certain components to pass 
while retaining other components. Overall a very simple, clean and efficient concept but as you will 
realize when going through this book a handful of different phenomena will impact the process and 
make the scenario not that simple after all! Initially some of the most important terms used in membrane 
technology are shown in Figure 1. 
Figure 1: Membrane process
Sketch of a membrane process. The core is a membrane through which a driving force induces a flux from the bulk 
to the permeate side.
The feed side is often referred to as the bulk solution. The components in the bulk solution that are 
retained can also be referred to at the retentate after it has been in contact with the membrane. When 
a driving force is established across the membrane, a flux will go through the membrane from the bulk 
solution to the permeate side. The flux is often denoted with the letter ‚ÄúJ‚Ää‚Ää‚Äù and is often reported in units 
of liter pr. m2 pr. hour [L/(m2¬∑h)]. The liquid going through the membrane is called the permeate.

Introduction
A particular separation is accomplished by use of a membrane with the ability of transporting one 
component more readily than another. In other words, the membrane is more permeable to certain 
components because of differences in physical or chemical properties between the membrane and the 
components that are transported through the membrane. 
‚Ä¢	 Difference in size: In many membrane processes (microfiltration and ultrafiltration for example) 
porous membranes with a given pore size distribution are used. Because of the pore size, some 
components will be retained by the membrane because of their size and some components are 
small enough to pass through to pores in the membrane. 
‚Ä¢	 Difference in charge: In some membrane processes (electrodialysis for example) differently 
charged components are separated. This can by done by use of cation and anion exchange 
membranes which only allows transport of cations and anions, respectively. Cation exchange 
membranes are, for example, incorporated with negatively charged groups which will repel 
anions and allow transport of cations.
As seen in Figure 1, a driving force across the membrane induces a flux of permeate from the bulk 
solution to the permeate side. You can find a broad variety of membrane processes driven by different 
driving forces:
‚Ä¢	 Pressure gradient
‚Ä¢	 Concentration gradient
‚Ä¢	 Electrical voltage gradient
‚Ä¢	 Temperature gradient
In this book we will focus on pressure driven membrane processes, in which the flux through the 
membrane is induced by a hydrostatic pressure gradient between the bulk solution and the permeate 
side. Pressure driven membrane processes include microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, and 
reverse osmosis.

Introduction
In microfiltration and ultrafiltration, porous membranes with the approximate pore sizes given in Table 1 
are used. Membranes for nanofiltration and reverse osmosis can be considered as an intermediate between 
porous membranes with very small pores and dense membranes which are used, for example, in gas 
separation. The transition from microfiltration over ultrafiltration to nanofiltration and reverse osmosis 
is not sharp but lies in the areas of the pore sizes given in Table 1. Approximate pressure ranges are also 
given in Table 1. It is seen that as the membrane pores/structure becomes more open, the necessary 
applied operational hydrostatic pressure decreases. Thus only relatively small pressure levels are used in 
microfiltration whereas relatively large hydrostatic pressures are required to run reverse osmosis.
Proportionality between the flux and the driving force is often seen (at least when pure solvent permeat 
the membrane). The proportionality can be described by a phenomenological equation:


 
 


(1)
The flux J is proportional to the driving force, which is expressed as the gradient of X (pressure, 
concentration, electrical voltage or temperature) in the direction x perpendicular the membrane surface. 
The proportionality constant A is called a phenomenological coefficient. Because the gradient is negative 
in the direction x of the flux, a minus-sign is placed on the right side of the equation. In pressure driven 
membrane processes the driving force is a pressure difference across the membrane. The term dX/dx 
in equation (1) can then be replaced by ŒîP which is the difference between the hydrostatic pressure of 
the bulk side and the permeate side. Darcy‚Äôs law is simply just such a phenomenological expression in 
which the driving force is the pressure:



 



(2)
The phenomenological coefficient in Darcy‚Äôs law is denoted lp, which is the permeability coefficient of the 
membrane. The permeability coefficient in (2) is inversely proportional to the thickness of the membrane 
selective layer, and thus in order to achieve as high permeability as possible, asymmetric membranes 
with a very thin selective layer (skin layer) are often used. The skin layer is then attached onto an open 
porous support structure and thus the membrane is referred to as being asymmetric. The thickness of 
skin layers in asymmetric membrane is often in the order of magnitude of 1 mm. The permeability also 
depends on the dynamic viscosity of the fluid which is transported through the membrane and the 
resistance of the membrane towards mass transport. The permeability of microfiltration membranes are 
larger than for ultrafiltration membranes, and nanofiltration / reverse osmosis membranes have very low 
permeabilities. Therefore higher pressures are necessary to run reverse osmosis than for ultrafiltration 
and microfiltration, which again is seen in Table 1.
Two fundamentally different ways of running pressure driven membrane processes are sketched in 
Figure 2.

Figure 2: Dead-end and cross-flow filtration
Two different ways of running a pressure driven membrane process.
In dead-end filtration the bulk solution is pumped or pressurized through the membrane. That way the 
permeate will be forced through the membrane and the bulk solution will decrease in volume if the feed, 
for example, is contained in a batch cell. In dead-end filtration the pressure is constant throughout the 
whole membrane area. In cross-flow filtration, however, the bulk solution is pumped tangentially along 
the membrane surface. Again, the flux will be induced because of a larger pressure on the bulk side, but 
because of the tangentially flow over the membrane surface there will also be a pressure drop tangentially 
along the membrane surface on the bulk side. The pressure will, thus, not be constant throughout the 
whole membrane area which means that the driving force pressure difference across the membrane is 
also not at the same level throughout the whole membrane area. In Figure 2 the terms feed and retentate 
is visualized in the cross-flow case. The feed is introduced in one end of the membrane feed channel 
and the retentate is returned at the other end of the membrane feed channel. In dead-end filtration no 
retentate is continually removed. Cross-flow filtration has several advantages in comparison to dead-end 
filtration which will be described more in the Concentration polarization section.
If the membrane is semi permeable, the concentration in the permeate (of the components that are 
supposed to be retained) is close to zero, and the retention is close to 1 (100%). The retention is 
however often lower than 1 because the concentration increases close to the membrane surface (see the 
Concentration polarization section). The retention can be defined in different ways:

Introduction
The concentration in the permeate stream is denoted cp, the bulk concentration is denoted cb and the 
concentration just at the membrane surface is denoted cm. Because of convective transport of the retained 
components towards the membrane surface, the concentration at the surface cm is often larger than in the 
bulk solution. This phenomenon is called concentration polarization. An enhanced surface concentration 
can lead to an increased permeate concentration. Because cm is larger than cb, the true retention is often 
higher than the observed retention. The difference between the observed retention and the true retention 
is very important to understand:
‚Ä¢	 The observed retention S describes what retention the system as a whole is able to deliver.
‚Ä¢	 The true retention R describes what retention the membrane itself is capable of delivering. 
The observed retention is very dependent upon the pressure and the hydrodynamic conditions of the 
system in the membrane feed channels, whereas the true retention is more or less constant (except at 
low fluxes, at which the true retention can decrease).

Osmotic pressure difference
2	 Osmotic pressure difference
The osmotic pressure difference between the bulk solution and the permeate stream is often an important 
factor to consider in pressure driven membrane processes. Therefore, before we go any further, the 
osmotic pressure concept will be briefly explained. 
2.1	
Introduction to osmosis
The terms ‚Äúosmosis‚Äù and ‚Äúosmotic pressure‚Äù can be explained in different ways. First we will look at 
Figure 3.

Figure 3: Osmosis and osmotic pressure
Two solutions with different solute concentrations are separated by a semipermeabel membrane that allows only transport of solvent 
and not solute. As time passes, solvent will flow through the membrane as sketched at time t1. The solvent flow towards the concentrated 
side is called osmosis (osmotic flow). Because of the osmosis, the liquid level on the concentrated side increases, yielding a hydrostatic 
pressure difference build-up (osmotic pressure) between the two sides. Eventually, the osmotic flow stops at equilibrium. The hydrostatic 
pressure difference between the two solutions at equilibrium is called the osmotic pressure. 
Initially two solutions at different concentration are separated by a semipermeabel membrane that 
only allows transport of solvent and not solute. The solute concentration C1 is larger than the solute 
concentration C2. As time passes, solvent will flow through the membrane from the lower solute 
concentration to the higher solute concentration, as sketched at time t1. That way the solvent pursues to 
dilute the more concentrated solute solution. This solvent flow is called osmosis. Because of the osmosis 
the liquid level on the concentrated solute side will increase resulting in a hydrostatic pressure difference 
build-up. Eventually, the hydrostatic pressure difference (liquid level on the concentrated solute side) 
reaches a certain level and equilibrium is reached. The hydrostatic pressure difference between the two 
solutions at equilibrium is called the osmotic pressure. If a hydrostatic pressure, just equal to the osmotic 
pressure, was initially applied on the solution side to the left (C1) at time t = 0, the osmotic flow would 
have been prevented.

Osmotic pressure difference
We have now learned that osmotic pressure is induced by the phenomenon of osmosis. The phenomenon 
of osmotic pressure can also be thought of as ‚Äúosmotic suction‚Äù. The more concentrated solute solution 
(C1) pursues to be more diluted. Thus, the more concentrated solute solution ‚Äúsucks‚Äù solvent through 
the semipermeabel membrane in order to become more diluted. During the ‚Äúosmotic suction‚Äù the liquid 
level on the concentrated solute side will of course increase, causing a hydrostatic pressure difference 
build-up which, as mentioned above, is called the osmotic pressure. The ‚Äúosmotic suction‚Äù is stopped 
when the hydrostatic pressure difference (osmotic pressure) between the two solutions has reached a 
certain equilibrium level. 
As we have seen now, an osmotic flow of solvent through a semipermeabel membrane is induced from 
the right towards the left on Figure 3. However, to go a bit deeper into understanding osmosis you 
might be asking yourself the following questions: Why does the concentrated solute solution pursues 
to be more dilute? Why does the diluted solute side pursue to dilute the concentrated solute side? Why 
does the osmotic flow or osmotic suction occur? And why does the osmotic flow stops at a certain 
equilibrium level?
The answers can be found by looking at the solvent concentrations (or solvent activities) or rather the 
chemical potentials of the solvent. We look at the solvent and not the solute because it is the solvent that 
is capable of passing the membrane. The chemical potential is denoted m, and the chemical potential of 
the solvent is defined by the following expression:

(4)
The chemical potential m of the solvent is a function of the standard chemical potential m0 (at infinite 
dilution), the temperature T, the solvent activity a, the molar volume V of the solvent and the pressure 
P. Again, we look at Figure 3. The solute concentration (activity) is higher on the left side (C1 > C2), 
and therefore the solvent concentration (solvent activity) is higher of the right side. Thus, the initial 
chemical potential of the solvent is higher of the right side because of larger solvent activity. Since the 
system pursues to reach equilibrium (pursues to have equal solvent chemical potential on both sides 
of the semipermeabel membrane), solvent will flow through the membrane from the higher chemical 
solvent potential towards the lower solvent chemical potential. This flow is called osmosis, and the flow is 
proportional to the solvent chemical potential gradient over the membrane, -dm/dx. Hence, the osmotic 
flow increases the solvent activity ‚Äúa‚Äù and the pressure ‚ÄúP‚Ää‚Ää‚Äù on the left side of the membrane (Figure 3) 
resulting in an increasing solvent chemical potential on the left side. At the same time the pressure and 
solvent activity on the right side of the membrane decreases (liquid level drops and the solution gets 
more concentrated). The drop in pressure and solvent activity on the right side decreases the solvent 
chemical potential. The osmotic flow stops when the chemical potential of the solvent is equal on both 
sides of the membrane.

Osmotic pressure difference
2.2	
Osmotic pressure model
In order to obtain a flux through the membrane from the bulk side (with larger solute concentration) to 
the permeate side (with lower solute concentration), the applied hydrostatic pressure on the bulk side 
has to be larger than the osmotic pressure difference between the bulk and permeate side. If we again 
look at Figure 3, this corresponds to applying a hydrostatic pressure on the left side that is larger than 
the osmotic pressure. Thus, an osmotic pressure term ‚àÜœÄ has to be added to Darcy‚Äôs law (equation (2)) 
in order to establish the flux equation. This is called to the osmotic pressure model:

You can say that applying a hydrostatic pressure P on the bulk side increases the chemical potential of 
the solvent on the bulk side (according to equation (4)). This increase induces a gradient in the solvent 
chemical potential across the membrane. Thus, the system will ‚Äúallow‚Äù or ‚Äúfacilitate‚Äù a flux of solvent from 
the bulk to the permeate in order to equalize this solvent chemical potential gradient (to pursue to reach 
equilibrium). However, as the bulk is often re-circulated and the permeate is often continually removed 
in pressure driven membrane processes, equilibrium is never reached and the flux is thus maintained.

Osmotic pressure difference
To exemplify the use of the osmotic pressure model, we can look at sea water. The osmotic pressure of 
sea water is around 30 bar. This means that when reverse osmosis of sea water is conducted, a hydrostatic 
pressure of 30 bar is needed in order just to overcome the osmotic pressure. Also in microfiltration and 
ultrafiltration the osmotic pressure can play a great role because the back diffusion of large molecules 
from the membrane surface into the bulk solution is often low and, thus, there will be a relative large 
concentration on the membrane surface giving a relative large osmotic pressure.
2.3	
Calculation of the osmotic pressure
An osmotic pressure difference exists across the membrane, as described in the previous section, because 
of the solvent concentration (activity) difference between the bulk solution and the permeate side. The 
applied hydrostatic pressure difference between the bulk and permeate has to be larger than the osmotic 
pressure difference in order to obtain a flux through the membrane from the bulk side to the permeate 
side. These considerations are summarized in the osmotic pressure model, as we saw earlier. But how 
do we calculate the osmotic pressure of a solution?
The osmotic pressure œÄ of a solution can be calculated by use of the van‚Äôt Hoff equation:

(6)
In this equation, R is the gas constant, T the absolute temperature, Mi the molar mass of component i 
and ci the concentration of component i. When the osmotic pressure is to be calculated for a sodium 
chloride solution, the concentration of NaCl has to be multiplied with ‚Äú2‚Äù because of the dissociation 
into two ions (a sodium ion and a chloride ion). The proportionality between osmotic pressure and 
concentration given in equation (6) applies at low concentrations and for low MW molecules.
When the osmotic pressure is to be calculated for macromolecular solutions or high concentration 
solutions, a virial expansion expression can be used:

Here it is seen that the van‚Äôt Hoffs equation is the first term of the expanded expression. It is also seen 
that when the concentration is low, almost only the first term contributes to the osmotic pressure. In 
that way, equation (7) is reduced to van‚Äôt Hoffs equation (equation (6)). The terms B and C are constants 
for specific molecules.

The term A is a constant for a specific type of macromolecule and the exponential factor n has a value 
larger than ‚Äú1‚Äù. The take home message is that macromolecules at high concentrations can constitute a 
significant osmotic pressure that need to be taken into consideration when designing a membrane based 
separation process in which macromolecules are to be retained.

Resistance towards mass transport
3	 Resistance towards 
mass transport
According to Darcy‚Äôs law (equation (2)) and the osmotic pressure model (equation (5)), the flux through 
the membrane is only dependent on the applied hydrostatic pressure and the osmotic pressure difference. 
In practice the flux will however decrease dramatically and can drop to a level as low as around 5% or less 
compared to the initial flux when solutions containing particular material and macromolecules are being 
processed. This can be due to a build-up of a concentration gradient in the laminar film layer over the 
membrane surface caused by the convective transport of solutes towards the membrane (concentration 
polarization), formation of a macromolecular gel layer on the membrane surface and other types of 
membrane fouling, which will be described more in the following sections. Thus, a term concerning the 
total resistance towards mass transport through the membrane Rtot has to be incorporated into Darcy‚Äôs 
law (and the osmotic pressure model):

The total resistance increases with time due to different types of membrane fouling, leading to a decline 
in flux when a constant pressure is applied. From equation (9) it is also seen that the dynamic viscosity 
Œ∑ is reverse proportional to the flux ‚Äì meaning all other being equal, the flux of thick glucose syrup 
will be lower than the flux of pure water! The total resistance is the sum of all sub resistances towards 
mass transport:

Rm is the membrane resistance itself, which is a membrane constant, RCP is the resistance caused by 
concentration polarization and Rf is the resistance caused by membrane fouling. The two latter terms

Concentration polarization
During membrane filtration, the convective transport of solutes towards the membrane will lead to a

Resistance towards mass transport
Figure 4: Concentration polarization
Sketch of the concentration profile in the boundary layer in a polarization situation.
In a distance Œ¥ from the membrane surface, complete mixing is assumed resulting in a constant bulk 
concentration cb. This is sketched in the figure by the up-going arrows to the left showing the cross-flow 
along the membrane. In the laminar boundary film layer, with the thickness Œ¥, the concentration c is 
increasing due to the convective solute transport in direction x of the flux. This convective transport is 
balanced by the diffusive transport of solutes back into the bulk solution and the part of the solutes that 
goes through the membrane to the permeate side. A solute mass balance in the laminar boundary film 
layer can be set up by these three terms (defined in the direction x according to Figure 4):
‚Ä¢	 Convective solute transport towards the membrane in the laminar film layer:	
J√óc 
‚Ä¢	 Diffusive transport in the laminar boundary film layer back into the bulk:	
D√ódc/dx
‚Ä¢	 Transport of solutes in the permeate away from the membrane:		
	
J√ócp
The diffusion coefficient is denoted D, and dc/dx is the concentration gradient in the laminar boundary 
film layer. Setting up a mass balance gives the following first order differential equation, which describes 
the concentration polarization in stationary conditions. The boundary conditions (BC) are also seen 
from Figure 4.

This film theory equation describes the correlation between the bulk, permeate and membrane surface 
concentrations and the flux. The term Œ¥/D can be replaced by 1/k, where k is the mass transfer coefficient 
of the system. Hence, the mass transfer coefficient tells something about the level of the back-diffusion 
of solutes from the membrane surface and boundary layer towards the bulk solution. It is seen that when 
the mass transfer coefficient is low, the concentration polarization can be large, resulting in a large surface 
concentration cm compared to the bulk concentration cb. A high concentration on the membrane surface is 
often not wanted, as it can lead to larger solute concentration in the permeate. Therefore it is often desirable 
to decrease the thickness of the laminar boundary layer Œ¥, as it will increase the mass transfer coefficient 
and thus the back-diffusion of solutes into the bulk solution. An increased mass transfer coefficient will 
according to the film theory (equation (12)) result in decreased surface concentration and thus a relatively 
lower permeate concentration. A decrease in the thickness of the laminar boundary layer can be achieved 
by changing the hydrodynamic conditions on the bulk side. An increased cross-flow velocity along the 
membrane surface will decrease the laminar boundary layer thickness, for example. Therefore better 
filtration performance is often seen when cross-flow filtration is done instead of dead-end filtration (see 
Figure 2). Approximate estimates of mass transfer coefficients for a system can be determined based on 
literature correlations including the dimensionless Reynolds, Schmidt, and Sherwood numbers.

Resistance towards mass transport
Because of the difference in bulk and surface concentration due to concentration polarization, a quite 
large deviation between the observed and true retention (equation (3)) is often observed. As mentioned 
earlier, the true retention tells something about how large an amount of the solutes the membrane itself 
is capable of retaining, whereas the observed retention is the retention you actually achieve in the system 
during filtration. This means that a potential high true retention of a membrane will often not be utilized 
very much because of a high surface concentration due to concentration polarization. This can often be 
improved by changing the hydrodynamic conditions at the membrane surface.

Gel layer model
The gel layer model is often used when processing macromolecules, typically proteins. When the 
concentration on the membrane surface cm reaches a certain level, due to concentration polarization, a 
gel can be formed at the membrane surface with a constant gel concentration cg. This gel is then assumed 
to be impermeable to the macromolecules, it consists of, and thus the permeate concentration cp is zero. 
Inserting this into the film theory model (equation (12)) gives the gel layer model, which can be used 
to calculate a limiting flux (Jlim) through the membrane when a gel layer is established.

Again, the mass transfer coefficient is denoted k. The gel layer model can be quite useful, although some 
of its assumptions have been reported in literature not to hold. The gel concentration, for example, 
should be independent of the bulk concentration, which often not seems to be the case. Furthermore, the 
diffusivity (D = k √ó Œ¥) is often not constant but concentration dependent to some extent. Finally, some 
macromolecules do not tend to form a gel as easy as other macromolecules. However, corresponding 
flux and concentration data can be used to estimate the mass transfer coefficient and gel concentration 
graphically from the gel layer model (for example during a concentration filtration run). This is done 
by rearranging equation (13):

The flux in equation (14) is then the limiting flux. Thus, flux (J) data and bulk concentration (cb) data 
can be plotted in order to determine the mass transfer coefficient and the gel layer concentration. This 
is visualized in Figure 5.

Resistance towards mass transport
Figure 5: Gel layer model
Graphical estimation of the mass transfer coefficient and the gel concentration from the gel layer model.
From equation (14) and Figure 5 it is seen that the mass transfer coefficient can be estimated from the 
slope and the gel layer concentration can be estimated from the intercept with the x-axis. When doing 
this, the assumptions of the gel layer model have to be checked. As mentioned earlier, the assumptions 
not always hold, since, for example, the gel layer concentration is not always constant but dependent 
to some extent of the bulk concentration. Also, when the slope is relatively small, the uncertainty in 
the intercept with the x-axis increases, yielding large uncertainty in the determination of the gel layer 
concentration. Thus, you have to be aware when using the gel layer model to graphically estimate the 
mass transfer coefficient and gel layer concentration.

Membrane fouling
Under stationary conditions the concentration polarization gives a constant contribution to the total 
resistance towards mass transport through the membrane. This corresponds to a constant term RCP in 
equation (10), page 12. Thus, the flux should be constant when the applied hydrostatic pressure is constant, 
but in practice the flux often keeps decreasing during filtration. This is due to membrane fouling, which 
is sketched in Figure 6.

Resistance towards mass transport
Figure 6: Flux decline during filtration
Flux decline at constant applied pressure during filtration. Concentration polarization contributes with a constant resistance 
towards mass transport through the membrane, whereas the fouling contribution continually increases resulting in a continually 
decreasing flux.
Membrane fouling is a complex phenomenon affected by many factors such as concentration, temperature, 
pH, ion strength, hydrophilic/hydrophobic interactions etc. Membrane fouling can, for example, consist 
of adsorption of different molecules, colloids or salts on the membrane surface and on the pore walls 
inside the membrane. Such adsorption will increase the resistance towards mass transport. Membrane 
fouling can also be blocking of the pores by different cells, bacteria or aggregated macromolecules, or 
it can be the build-up of a cake layer on the membrane surface. Membrane fouling can be divided into
‚Ä¢	 irreversible membrane fouling and
‚Ä¢	 reversible membrane fouling.
Often the irreversible membrane fouling is established first. This could be a rather tightly bounded 
adsorbed mono-layer of components on the membrane surface. Such a layer can act as a base for further 
build-up of a continually growing fouling layer, which is often removable by changing the hydrodynamic 
conditions or water rinsing. An easily removable outer fouling layer is categorized as reversible membrane 
fouling. The reversible fouling layer is often removed when the pressure is released or when the membrane 
is washed with water, whereas the irreversible fouling layer often has to be removed by cleaning the 
membrane with certain chemical cleaning agents. Since there in principle is no limit for the growth of 
a membrane fouling layer, the resistance towards mass transport caused by membrane fouling can, in 
principle, continually increase leading to the continually decreasing flux which is sketched in Figure 6. 
Thus, the term Rf in equation (10) on page 12 keeps increasing, leading to a continually decreasing flux, 
according to the extended version of Darcy‚Äôs law (equation (9), page 12).

Resistance towards mass transport
Because of the complex nature of membrane fouling no single equation is able to handle the phenomenon 
of membrane fouling. Different approaches including the description of the fouling layer as a filter cake 
has been tried with more or less success. The extent of membrane fouling and the nature of the fouling 
depend completely on the medium that is filtered and the hydrodynamic conditions in the experimental 
apparatus on the bulk side. Thus it is very difficult to generalize membrane fouling phenomena.

Summary
4	 Summary
Basic terms and equations used in membrane technology have been presented and explained in this 
book. The osmotic pressure term, which often plays a great role in pressure driven membrane processes, 
has been discussed and equations for calculating the osmotic pressure for different feed solutions have 
been presented and explained. The osmotic considerations lead to the osmotic pressure model which 
tells that in order to obtain a flux through the membrane from the bulk solution to the permeate side, 
the applied hydrostatic pressure has to be larger than the osmotic pressure difference between the bulk 
solution and the permeate side. 
In the laminar film boundary layer at the membrane surface on the bulk side different phenomena 
lead to different kinds of resistances towards mass transport. The convective transport of solutes in the 
perpendicular direction towards the membrane surface leads to a concentration increase in the laminar 
film layer. This is called concentration polarization and it is often desirable to reduce this phenomenon 
in order to reduce the constant contribution to the total resistance towards mass transport through 
the membrane. When the concentration of certain types of macromolecules reaches a certain level in 
the laminar film layer, due to concentration polarization, a gel with a constant gel concentration can 
be formed. Thus the film theory model can be rewritten into a gel layer model, which is also presented 
and discussed in this book.
Concentration polarization can lead to the build up of a fouling layer on the membrane surface, which also 
contributes to the total resistance towards mass transport. However, membrane fouling also covers many 
other complex phenomena that can lead to a partly or completely clogging of the membrane. Membrane 
fouling is very dependent on the hydrodynamic conditions on the bulk side and the pH, concentration, 
temperature, ion strength etc. It is very difficult to generalize membrane fouling phenomena between 
different membrane filtration systems.
