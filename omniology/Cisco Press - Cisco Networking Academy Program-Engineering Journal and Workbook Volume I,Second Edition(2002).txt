Engineering Journal and Workbook Questions and Answers 
Chapter 1 
Computer Basics 
Introduction 
It is important to be able to recognize and name the major components of a PC for the 
following three reasons: 
• 
Computers are important network-building devices.  
• 
Many networking devices are themselves special-purpose computers, with many 
of the same parts as “normal” PCs. 
• 
For you to view the online curriculum, your own computer must be in working 
order, which means that you might need to occasionally troubleshoot simple 
problems in your computer’s hardware and software.  
 
Concept Questions 
Demonstrate your knowledge of these concepts by answering the questions in the 
Engineering Journal space provided. 
• 
The transistor and the integrated circuit made modern computers possible. 
Explain why. 
The invention of a semiconductor transistor opened up many possibilities for 
making smaller, more reliable computers. Millions of transistors can now be 
placed on one small piece of semiconductor. Further microminiaturization of 
integrated circuits leads to widespread use of PCs in homes and businesses. 
• 
If your computer doesn’t power up, what steps might you take to identify 
and correct the problem? 
If your computer does not power up as expected, consider verifying the following:  
⇒ 
Power cord is plugged into wall socket. 
⇒ 
Power switch is switched to the on (1) position. 
⇒ 
Motherboard power inlet is securely fastened.

• 
Explain how to do the following: 
⇒ 
Select the NIC card. 
The network card selection should involve consideration of the following: 
• 
Bus type (PCI, ISA, EISA, and so on) 
• 
Network topology (bus, ring, star) 
• 
Medium type (UTP, STP, 10Base2, 10Base5, 10BaseF) 
• 
Transport speed (1 Mbps, 4 Mbps, 10 Mbps, 16 Mbps, 100 
Mbps, 1000 Mbps) 
⇒ 
Set the correct IP address. 
The IP address selected should be on the same network or subnetwork 
as the other devices that need to be accessed. This should be a unique 
address that is not currently being used by any other nodes on the local 
network.  
⇒ 
Adjust the display (if necessary).  
The display can easily be changed by selecting the display icon from the 
control panel. Select the setting option and choose the desired resolution 
and color depth. Click Apply to reflect changes. 
⇒ 
Install and set up the browser. 
Use the installer program to install and configure your browser. Once 
installed, add any necessary browser plug-ins such as Flash or 
Shockwave. Choose your method of connectivity, usually dialup or local-
area network (LAN). 
The first connection attempt after install will invoke the Internet Wizard 
Utility.

6. 
What is data throughput and how does it relate to digital bandwidth? 
Throughput refers to the actual, measured bandwidth, at a specific time of day, 
using specific Internet routes, while downloading a specific file. The throughput is 
often far less than the maximum possible digital bandwidth of the medium that is 
being used. 
7. 
Why are there different bandwidths? 
Some factors that determine throughput and bandwidth include the following: 
Internetworking devices 
Type of data being transferred 
Topology 
Number of users 
User’s computer 
Server computer 
Power- and weather-induced outages 
Congestion 
8. 
What units measure the quantity of information? 
The most basic unit of information is the bit. The basic unit of time is the second. 
If you want to describe the amount of information flow in a specific period of time, 
you could use the units “bits per second” to describe this flow. 
9. 
How do binary numbers represent alphanumeric data? 
Alphanumeric characters are converted to data that can travel across the 
internetwork. The data is put into a packet or a datagram that contains a network 
header with source and destination logical addresses. These addresses help 
network devices send the packets across the network along a dynamically 
chosen path. Each network device must put the packet into a frame. The frame 
includes a header with the physical address of the next directly connected device 
in the path. 
The frame must be converted into a pattern of 1s and 0s (bits) for transmission 
on the medium (usually a wire).

The OSI Model 
Introduction 
The OSI reference model is a descriptive network scheme whose standards ensure 
greater compatibility and interoperability between various types of network technologies. 
Further, the OSI reference model is a way of illustrating how information travels through 
networks. It is a conceptual framework specifying the network functions that occur at 
each layer. The OSI model describes how information or data makes its way from 
application programs (such as spreadsheets) through a network medium (such as wires) 
to another application program located on another computer on a network. 
 
Concept Questions 
Demonstrate your knowledge of these concepts by answering the following questions in 
the space provided. 
The ISO recognized the need to create a network model that would help vendors create 
interoperable network implementations and released the OSI reference model in 1984. 
• 
The OSI reference model is a descriptive network scheme whose standards 
ensure greater compatibility and interoperability between various types of 
network technologies. Why is such a standard necessary? 
In the early days of networking, it became harder for networks that used different 
specifications and implementations to communicate with each other. They 
realized that they needed to move away from proprietary networking systems. 
The ISO created a network model that could help vendors create networks that 
would be compatible with, and interoperate with, other networks. 
• 
The OSI reference model organizes distinct functions of a network into seven 
numbered layers. Briefly describe what each layer does. 
Layer 7: The application layer  
The application layer establishes the availability of intended communication 
partners. It also synchronizes and establishes an agreement on procedures for 
error recovery and control of data integrity. Examples of such applications are 
spreadsheet programs, word processing programs, and bank terminal programs. 
Layer 6: The presentation layer 
The presentation layer ensures that the information that the application layer of 
one system sends out is readable by the application layer of another system. If 
necessary, the presentation layer translates between multiple data formats by 
using a common format. This layer also is responsible for compression and 
encryption. 

 
12 - 239 
 Engineering Journal and Workbook, Vol. I, 2nd Ed. – Chapter 2  
Copyright © 2002 Cisco Systems, Inc. 
Layer 5: The session layer  
The session layer establishes, manages, and terminates sessions between two 
communicating hosts. The session layer provides its services to the presentation 
layer. It also synchronizes dialog between the two hosts’ presentation layers and 
manages their data exchange. In addition to session regulation, the session layer 
offers provisions for efficient data transfer, class of service, and exception 
reporting of session layer, presentation layer, and application layer problems. 
Layer 4: The transport layer  
The transport layer segments data from the sending host’s system and 
reassembles the data into a data stream on the receiving host’s system. The 
transport layer attempts to provide a data transport service that shields the upper 
layers from transport implementation details. The transport layer establishes, 
maintains, and properly terminates connection-oriented circuits. To provide 
reliable service, transport error detection and recovery is used as well as 
information flow control. 
Layer 3: The network layer  
The network layer is a complex layer that provides connectivity and path 
selection between two host systems that might be located on geographically 
separated networks. Path selection, routing, and logical addressing all take place 
at the network layer. 
Layer 2: The data link layer 
The data link layer provides the transit of data across a physical link. In so doing, 
the data link layer is concerned with physical (as opposed to logical) addressing, 
network (sometimes called logical) topology, network media access, and error 
detection. 
Layer 1: The physical layer 
The physical layer defines the electrical, mechanical, procedural, and functional 
specifications for activating, maintaining, and deactivating the physical link 
between end systems. Such characteristics as voltage levels, timing of voltage 
changes, physical data rates, maximum transmission distances, physical 
connectors, and other, similar, attributes are defined by physical layer 
specifications. 
 
Vocabulary Exercise Chapter 2 
Define the following terms as completely as you can. Use the online Chapter 2 or the 
Cisco Systems Networking Academy: First-Year Companion Guide, Second Edition, 
material for help. 
Datagram     Logical grouping of information sent as a network layer unit over a 
transmission medium without prior establishment of a virtual circuit. IP datagrams are 
the primary information units in the Internet. 

 
13 - 239 
 Engineering Journal and Workbook, Vol. I, 2nd Ed. – Chapter 2

Encapsulation     The wrapping of data in a particular protocol header. For example, 
Ethernet data is wrapped in a specific Ethernet header before network transit. Also, 
when bridging dissimilar networks, the entire frame from one network is just placed in 
the header used by the data link layer protocol of the other network. 
Frame     Logical grouping of information sent as a data link layer unit over a 
transmission medium. Often refers to the header and trailer that surround the user data 
contained in the unit (used for synchronization and error control). 
Layer 1: Physical     The physical layer defines the electrical, mechanical, procedural, 
and functional specifications for activating, maintaining, and deactivating the physical 
link between end systems. 
Layer 2: Data Link     This layer provides reliable transit of data across a physical link. 
The data link layer is concerned with physical addressing, network topology, line 
discipline, error notification, ordered delivery of frames, and flow control. The IEEE has 
divided this layer into two sublayers: the MAC sublayer and the LLC sublayer. 
Layer 3: Network     This layer provides connectivity and path selection between two 
end systems. The network layer is the layer at which routing occurs. 
Layer 4: Transport     This layer is responsible for reliable network communication 
between end nodes. The transport layer provides mechanisms for the establishment, 
maintenance, and termination of virtual circuits, transport fault detection and recovery, 
and information flow control. 
Layer 5: Session     This layer establishes, manages, and terminates sessions between 
applications and manages data exchange between presentation layer entities. 
Layer 6: Presentation     This layer ensures that information sent by the application 
layer of one system will be readable by the application layer of another. The 
presentation layer also is concerned with the data structures used by programs and 
therefore negotiates data transfer syntax for the application layer. 
Layer 7: Application     This layer provides services to application processes (such as 
electronic mail, file transfer, and terminal emulation) that are outside of the OSI model. 
The application layer identifies and establishes the availability of intended 
communication partners (and the resources required to connect with them), 
synchronizes cooperating applications, and establishes agreement on procedures for 
error recovery and control of data integrity. 
Packet     Logical grouping of information that includes a header containing control 
information and (usually) user data. Packets are most often used to refer to network 
layer units of data. 
Peer-to-peer     Peer-to-peer computing calls for each network device to run both client 
and server portions of an application. Also describes communication between 
implementations of the same OSI reference model layer in two different network 
devices. 
Segment      1) Section of a network that is bounded by bridges, routers, or switches. 2) 
In a LAN using a bus topology, a segment is a continuous electrical circuit that is often 
connected to other such segments with repeaters. 3) Term used in the TCP 
specification to describe a single transport layer unit of information.

TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)     Common name for the 
suite of protocols developed by the U.S. Department of Defense in the 1970s to support 
the construction of worldwide internetworks. TCP and IP are the two best-known 
protocols in the suite. 
TCP/IP application layer     The designers of TCP/IP thought that the higher level 
protocols should include the session and presentation layer details. They just created an 
application layer that handles high-level protocols, issues of representation, encoding, 
and dialog control. The TCP/IP combines all application-related issues into one layer 
and ensures this data is properly packaged for the next layer. This is also referred to as 
the process layer. 
TCP/IP Transport Layer  
The transport layer deals with the quality-of-service issues 
of reliability, flow control, and error correction. One of its protocols, the transmission 
control protocol (TCP), provides excellent and flexible ways to create reliable, well-
flowing, low-error network communications. TCP is a connection-oriented protocol. It 
dialogues between source and destination while packaging application layer information 
into units called segments. Connection-oriented does not mean that a circuit exists 
between the communicating computers (that would be circuit switching). It does mean 
that Layer 4 segments travel back and forth between two hosts to acknowledge the 
connection exists logically for some period. This is known as packet switching. 
TCP/IP Internet layer     The purpose of the Internet layer is to send source packets 
from any network on the internetwork and have them arrive at the destination 
independent of the path and networks they took to get there. The specific protocol that 
governs this layer is called the Internet Protocol (IP). Best path determination and 
packet switching occur at this layer. Think of it in terms of the postal system. 
When you mail a letter, you do not know how it gets there (there are various possible 
routes), but you do care that it arrives. 
TCP/IP network layer     The name of this layer is broad and somewhat confusing. It 
also is called the host-to-network layer. Sometimes, it’s shown as two layers, as in the 
OSI model. The network access layer is concerned with all the issues that an IP packet 
requires to actually cross a physical link from one device to a directly connected one. It 
includes the LAN and WAN technology details, and all the details in the OSI physical 
and data link layers.

(such as electronic mail, file transfer, and terminal emulation) that are outside of 
the OSI model. The application layer identifies and establishes the availability of 
intended communication partners (and the resources required to connect with 
them), synchronizes cooperating applications, and establishes agreement on 
procedures for error recovery and control of data integrity. 
Layer 6: Presentation—This layer ensures that information sent by the 
application layer of one system will be readable by the application layer of 
another. The presentation layer also is concerned with the data structures used 
by programs and therefore negotiates data transfer syntax for the application 
layer. 
Layer 5: Session—This layer establishes, manages, and terminates sessions 
between applications and manages data exchange between presentation layer 
entities. 
Layer 4: Transport—This layer is responsible for reliable network 
communication between end nodes. The transport layer provides mechanisms 
for the establishment, maintenance, and termination of virtual circuits, transport 
fault detection and recovery, and information flow control. 
Layer 3: Network—This layer provides connectivity and path selection between 
two end systems. The network layer is the layer at which routing occurs. 
Layer 2: Data Link—This layer provides reliable transit of data across a physical 
link. The data link layer is concerned with physical addressing, network topology, 
line discipline, error notification, ordered delivery of frames, and flow control. The 
IEEE has divided this layer into two sublayers: the MAC sublayer and the LLC 
sublayer. 
Layer 1: Physical—The physical layer defines the electrical, mechanical, 
procedural and functional specifications for activating, maintaining, and 
deactivating the physical link between end systems. 
3. 
What is meant by the term peer-to-peer communication? 
Each layer of the OSI model at the source must communicate with its peer layer 
at the destination.

Briefly describe the process of data encapsulation using the following 
terms: data, segment, packet, frame, and bits. 
Networks must perform the following five conversion steps to encapsulate data: 
• 
Build the data. As a user sends an e-mail message, its alphanumeric 
characters are converted to data that can travel across the internetwork. 
• 
Package the data for end-to-end transport. The data is packaged for 
internetwork transport. By using segments, the transport function ensures 
that the message hosts at both ends of the e-mail system can reliably 
communicate. 
• 
Add the network address to the header. The data is put into a packet or a 
datagram that contains a network header with source and destination 
logical addresses. These addresses help network devices send the 
packets across the network along a dynamically chosen path. 
• 
Append (add) the local address to the data link header. Each network 
device must put the packet into a frame. The frame includes a header 
with the physical address of the next directly connected device in the 
path. 
• 
Convert to bits for transmission. The frame must be converted into a 
pattern of 1s and 0s (bits) for transmission on the medium (usually a 
wire). A clocking function enables the devices to distinguish these bits as 
they travel across the medium. The medium on the physical internetwork 
can vary along the path used. For example, the e-mail message can 
originate on a LAN, cross a campus backbone, and go out a WAN link on 
its way toward its destination on another remote LAN. 
5. 
Describe the information that is added to the data packet as it is 
encapsulated in the transport, network, and data link layers. 
Encapsulation wraps data with the necessary protocol information before 
network transit. Therefore, as the data packet moves down through the layers of 
the OSI model, it receives headers, trailers, and other information. 
6. 
What is the OSI reference model?  
The Open System Interconnection reference model is a network architectural 
model developed by ISO and ITU-T. The model consists of seven layers, each of 
which specifies particular network functions such as addressing, flow control, 
error control, encapsulation, and reliable message transfer. The highest layer 
(the application layer) is closest to the user; the lowest layer (the physical layer) 
is closest to the media technology. The two lowest layers are implemented in 
hardware and software, whereas the upper five layers are implemented only in 
software. The OSI reference model is used universally as a way to teach and 
understand network functionality.

7. 
Will networks that are built following the OSI model be identical? 
Networks that are built following the OSI model will not be identical; however, 
there will be a much greater likelihood for interoperability. The OSI provides 
vendors with a set of standards that could enable greater compatibility and 
interoperability between the various types of network technologies. This will allow 
dissimilar networks to coexist. 
8. 
What process does the OSI model describe? 
The OSI model describes the process of breaking down a complex process into 
smaller, more easily defined steps. This allows for the creation of standards that 
help provide greater compatibility and interoperability between various types of 
network technologies.  
9. 
Define medium. 
The term medium refers to various physical environments through which 
transmission signals pass. Common network media include twisted-pair, coaxial, 
and fiber-optic cable, and the atmosphere (through which microwave, laser, and 
infrared transmission occurs). 
10. 
What is the importance of the TCP/IP model? 
The TCP/IP reference model and the TCP/IP protocol stack make data 
communication possible between any two computers, anywhere in the world, at 
nearly the speed of light. The TCP/IP model has historical importance, just like 
the standards that allowed the telephone, electrical power, railroad, television, 
and videotape industries to flourish. 
11. 
How does the OSI model compare with the TCP/IP model? 
The OSI model attempts to explain how various network technologies work 
together to transport valuable data. The OSI model is protocol independent, 
unlike the TCP/IP reference model. The U.S. Department of Defense created the 
TCP/IP reference model, which became the standard that facilitated the growth 
of the Internet.

Local-Area Networks 
Introduction 
Local-area networks (LANs) are high-speed, low-error data networks that cover a 
relatively small geographic area (up to a few thousand meters). LANs connect 
workstations, peripherals, terminals, and other devices in a single building or another 
geographically limited area. LANs provide multiple-connected desktop devices (usually 
PCs) with access to high-bandwidth media. LANs connect computers and services to a 
common Layer 1 media. 
 
Concept Questions 
Demonstrate your knowledge of these concepts by answering the following questions in 
the space provided: 
• 
The network operates within a building or floor of a building. What are the major 
characteristics of a LAN?  
A LAN is a high-speed, low-error data network covering a relatively small 
geographic area (up to a few thousand meters). LAN standards specify cabling 
and signaling at the physical and data link layers of the OSI model. Ethernet, 
FDDI, and Token Ring are widely used LAN technologies. 
• 
What are the major components of the average LAN? 
LANs connect workstations, peripherals, terminals, and other devices in a single 
building or other geographically limited area. 
 
Vocabulary Exercise Chapter 3 
Define the following terms as completely as you can. Use the online Chapter 3 or the 
Cisco Systems Networking Academy: First-Year Companion Guide, Second Edition, 
material for help. 
AUI (attachment unit interface)     IEEE 802.3 interface between a media attachment 
unit (MAU) and a network interface card (NIC). The term AUI also can refer to the rear 
panel port to which an AUI cable might attach, such as those found on a Cisco 
LightStream Ethernet access card. Also called transceiver cable. 
Bridge      Device that connects and passes packets between two network segments 
that use the same communications protocol. Bridges operate at the data link layer 
(Layer 2) of the OSI reference model. In general, a bridge will filter, forward, or flood an 
incoming frame based on the MAC address of that frame.

Hub     1) Generally, a term used to describe a device that serves as the center of a star 
topology network. 2) Hardware or software device that contains multiple independent but 
connected modules of network and internetwork equipment. Hubs can be active (where 
they repeat signals sent through them) or passive (where they do not repeat, but merely 
split, signals sent through them). 3) In Ethernet and IEEE 802.3, an Ethernet multiport 
repeater, sometimes referred to as a concentrator. 
IEEE 802.3     IEEE LAN protocol that specifies an implementation of the physical layer 
and the MAC sublayer of the data link layer. IEEE 802.3 uses CSMA/CD access at a 
variety of speeds over a variety of physical media. Extensions to the IEEE 802.3 
standard specify implementations for Fast Ethernet. Physical variations of the original 
IEEE 802.3 specification include 10BASE2, 10BASE5, 10BASE-F, 10BASE-T, and 
10Broad36. Physical variations for Fast Ethernet include 100BASE-T, 100BASE-T4, and 
100BASE-X. 
LAN (local-area network)     A LAN is a high-speed, low-error data network covering a 
relatively small geographic area (up to a few thousand meters). LANs connect 
workstations, peripherals, terminals, and other devices in a single building or other 
geographically limited area. LAN standards specify cabling and signaling at the physical 
and data link layers of the OSI model. Ethernet, FDDI, and Token Ring are widely used 
LAN technologies. 
MAC address     Standardized data link layer address that is required for every port or 
device that connects to a LAN. Other devices in the network use these addresses to 
locate specific ports in the network and to create and update routing tables and data 
structures. MAC addresses are 6 bytes long and are controlled by the IEEE. Also known 
as a hardware address, a MAC-layer address, or a physical address. 
MAU (media attachment unit)      Device used in Ethernet and IEEE 802.3 networks 
that provides the interface between the AUI port of a station and the common medium of 
the Ethernet. The MAU, which can be built into a station or can be a separate device, 
performs physical layer functions, including the conversion of digital data from the 
Ethernet interface, collision detection, and injection of bits onto the network. Sometimes 
referred to as a transceiver. In Token Ring, a MAU is known as a multistation access 
unit and is usually abbreviated MSAU to avoid confusion. 
Media     Plural of medium. The various physical environments through which 
transmission signals pass. Common network media include twisted-pair, coaxial and 
fiber-optic cable, and the atmosphere (through which microwave, laser, and infrared 
transmission occurs). Sometimes called physical media. 
NIC (network interface card)      Board that provides network communication 
capabilities to and from a computer system. Also called an adapter. 
RAM (random-access memory)     Volatile memory that can be read and written by a 
microprocessor. 
ROM (read-only memory)     Nonvolatile memory that can be read, but not written, by 
the microprocessor. 
Router     Network layer device that uses one or more metrics to determine the optimal 
path along which network traffic should be forwarded. Routers forward packets from one 
network to another based on network layer information. Occasionally called a gateway 
(although this definition of gateway is becoming increasingly outdated).

Switch     1) Network device that filters, forwards, and floods frames based on the 
destination address of each frame. The switch operates at the data link layer of the OSI 
model. 2) General term applied to an electronic or mechanical device that allows a 
connection to be established as necessary and terminated when there is no longer a 
session to support. 
 
Focus Questions  
1. 
What are the functions and OSI layer of computers, clients, servers, 
printers, and relational databases? 
Devices that connect directly to a network segment often are referred to as 
hosts. These hosts include computers (both clients and servers), printers, 
scanners, and many other user devices. The host devices can exist without a 
network, but its capabilities are greatly limited. Host devices are not part of any 
layer. They have a physical connection to the network media by having a NIC, 
and the functions of the other OSI layers are performed in software inside the 
host. This means that they operate at all seven layers of the OSI model. 
The basic function of computers on the LAN is to provide the user with an almost 
limitless set of opportunities. Modern software, microelectronics, and a relatively 
small amount of money enable you to run word processing, presentation, 
spreadsheet, and database programs. They also enable you to run a web 
browser, which gives you almost instant access to information via the World 
Wide web. You can send e-mail, edit graphics, save information in databases, 
play games, and communicate with other computers around the world. 
2. 
What is the purpose and OSI layer of network interface cards in a LAN? 
NICs are considered Layer 2 devices because each individual NIC throughout 
the world carries a unique code, called a Media Access Control (MAC) address. 
This address is used to control data communication for the host on the network. 
The NIC is the basic hardware component of network communications. It 
translates the parallel signal produced by the computer into the serial format that 
is sent over the network cable. 
3. 
What is the appearance and OSI layer of media in a LAN? 
The symbols for media vary, as shown in Figure 3-5. For example, the Ethernet 
symbol is typically a straight line with perpendicular lines projecting from it; the 
Token Ring network symbol is a circle with hosts attached to it; and for FDDI, the 
symbol is two concentric circles with attached devices. The basic functions of 
media are to carry a flow of information, in the form of bits, through a LAN. Other 
than wireless LANs (that use the atmosphere, or space, as the medium), 
networking media confine network signals to wire, cable, or fiber. Networking 
media are considered Layer 1 components of LANs. 

 
25 - 239 
 Engineering Journal and Workbook, Vol. I, 2nd Ed. – Chapter 3  
Copyright © 2002 Cisco Systems, Inc. 
4. 
What is the symbol and OSI layer of a repeater, as it applies to a LAN? 
The symbol for repeaters is not standardized—the symbol shown in Figure 3-9 
represents a repeater throughout the First-Year Companion Guide. The purpose 
of a repeater is to regenerate and retime network signals at the bit level to allow 
them to travel a longer distance on the media. 
5. 
What is the function and OSI layer of hub, as it applies to a LAN? 
Generally speaking, the term hub is used rather than repeater when referring to 
the device that serves as the center of a network. The purpose of a hub is to 
regenerate and retime network signals. Whereas a repeater typically has only 2 
ports, a hub generally has from 4 to 20 or more ports. Hubs are considered 
Layer 1 devices because they regenerate only the signal and repeat it out all of 
their ports (network connections). The symbol for a hub is not standardized; the 
symbol shown in Figure 3-12 represents a hub throughout the First-Year 
Companion Guide. 
6. 
What is the symbol and OSI layer of a bridge, as it applies to a LAN? 
A bridge is a Layer 2 device designed to create two or more LAN segments, 
each of which is a separate collision domain. The purpose of a bridge is to filter 
traffic on a LAN—to keep local traffic local—yet allow connectivity to other parts 
(segments) of the LAN for traffic that is directed there. Figure 3-15 shows the 
bridge symbol, which resembles a suspension bridge. 
7. 
What is the function and OSI layer of a switch on a LAN? 
A switch is a Layer 2 device just as a bridge is. In fact, a switch is sometimes 
called a multiport bridge, just like a hub is called a multiport repeater. The 
difference between the hub and the switch is the same as the difference 
between a repeater and a bridge: Switches make decisions based on MAC 
addresses, and hubs don’t make decisions at all. Figure 3-18 shows the symbol 
for a switch. The arrows on top represent the separate paths data can take in a 
switch, unlike the hub, where all data flows on all paths. 
8. 
What is the appearance and OSI layer of a router on a LAN? 
The purpose of a router is to examine incoming packets (Layer 3 data), choose 
the best path for them through the network, and then switch them to the proper 
outgoing port. Routers are the most important traffic-regulating devices on large 
networks. The symbol for a router, shown in Figure 3-20, is suggestive of its two 
primary purposes: path selection, and switching of packets to the best route. A 
router can have many different types of interface ports. 
9. 
What is the symbol and OSI layer of a cloud? 
The cloud symbol in Figure 3-24 suggests another network, or perhaps the entire 
Internet. It reminds you that there is a way to connect to that other network (for 
example, the Internet), but does not supply all the details of either the connection 
or the network. Because the cloud is not really a single device, but represents a 
collection of devices that operate at all levels of the OSI model, it could be 
classified as a Layer 1 through 7 device.

10. 
What is the function and OSI layer of network segments? 
A network segment is commonly defined as an area that makes up a collision 
domain. Historically, a segment identifies the Layer 1 media that is the common 
path for data transmission in a LAN. There is a maximum length for data 
transmission on each type of media. Each time an electronic device is used to 
extend the length or to manage data on the media, a new physical segment is 
created.

Layer 1: Electronics and Signals 
Introduction 
Electricity is a fact of modern life. We use it to perform a variety of tasks. It is brought to 
our homes, schools, and offices by power lines that carry it in the form of alternating 
current (AC). Another type of current, called direct current (DC), is the current found in a 
flashlight, car battery, and on the motherboard of a computer.  
It is important to understand the difference between these two types of current flow. 
Direct current flows at a constant value when circuits are turned on. Alternating current 
rises and falls in current values as power companies manufacture it. 
When it reaches our homes, schools, and offices, electricity is carried to appliances and 
machines via wires concealed in walls, floors, and ceilings. Consequently, inside these 
buildings, AC power-line noise is all around us. If not properly addressed, power-line 
noise can present problems for a network.  
In fact, as you will discover the more you work with networks, AC line noise coming from 
a nearby video monitor or hard disk drive can be enough to create errors in a computer 
system. It does this by burying the desired signals and preventing a computer’s logic 
gates from detecting the leading and trailing edges of the square signal waves. This 
problem can be further compounded when a computer has a poor ground connection. 
The third type of electricity is static electricity. This most damaging uncontrollable form 
of electricity must be dealt with to protect sensitive electronic equipment. Such static 
discharges can destroy semiconductors and data in a seemingly random fashion as they 
shoot through a computer like bullets. As it can with problems related to AC line noise, 
good grounding helps solve problems that arise from electrostatic discharge. 
 
Concept Questions 
Demonstrate your knowledge of these concepts by answering the following questions in 
the space provided: 
• 
Each wire in a cable can act like an antenna. When this happens, the wire 
actually absorbs electrical signals from other wires in the cable and from 
electrical sources outside the cable. If the resulting electrical noise reaches a 
high-enough level, it can become difficult for NIC cards to discriminate the noise 
from the data signal. When electrical noise on the cable originates from signals 
on other wires in the cable, this is known as crosstalk. How can you minimize 
crosstalk? 
Crosstalk can be avoided by adhering to standard termination procedures, 
proper installation methods, and use of quality twisted-pair cables. Ensure that 
termination of the cable endpoint is completed properly. Avoid untwisting the 
conductive cables and minimize unshielded cable lengths at termination 
endpoints.

To ensure optimal performance, it is important for the network media to carry the 
signal from one device to another with as little degradation as possible. In 
networking, several factors can cause the signal to degrade. Some of these 
factors are internal; whereas, others are external. Name some of the factors 
that can cause a signal to degrade and how to correct the problem. 
AC line noise creates problems in our homes, schools, and offices. AC line noise 
coming from a nearby video monitor or hard disk drive can be enough to create 
errors in a computer system. 
Electricity is carried to appliances and machines by wires concealed in walls, 
floors, and ceilings. Consequently, inside these buildings, AC power-line noise is 
all around us. If not properly prevented, power-line noise can cause problems for 
a network. 
• 
Inside copper wires, factors such as opposition to the flow of electrons 
(resistance), opposition to changes in voltage (capacitance), and opposition to 
changes in current (inductance) can cause signals to degrade. External sources 
of electrical impulses that can attack the quality of electrical signals on the cable 
include lighting, electrical motors, and radio systems. These types of interference 
are referred to as electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radio frequency 
interference (RFI). How can you protect your network from RFI? 
You can limit EMI and RFI in a number of ways. One way is to increase the size 
of the conductor wires. Another way is to improve the type of insulating material 
used. However, such changes increase the size and cost of the cable faster than 
they improve its quality. Therefore, it is more typical for network designers to 
specify a cable of good quality, and to provide specifications for the maximum 
recommended cable length between nodes. Two techniques that cable 
designers have used successfully in dealing with EMI and RFI are shielding and 
cancellation.

Conductor     Any material with a low resistance to electrical current. Any material 
capable of carrying an electrical current. 
Digital signal     Language of computers comprising only two states, on and off, which 
are indicated by a series of voltage pulses. 
Direct current (DC)     Electrical current that travels in only one direction. Direct current 
is generally used in electronic circuits. 
Electricity     Electrons in certain atoms can be pulled free from the atom and made to 
flow. This is electricity—a free flow of electrons. 
Electrons     Particles have a negative charge and orbit the nucleus. 
Electrostatic discharge (ESD)     A flow or spark of electricity that originates from a 
static source such as a carpet and arcs across a gap to another object. 
FM (frequency modulation)     Modulation technique in which signals of different 
frequencies represent different data values. 
Impedance     The total opposition to current flow (due to AC and DC voltages). The 
term resistance generally is used when referring to DC voltages. Impedance is the 
general term, and is the measure of how the flow of electrons is resisted, or impeded. 
Impedance is represented by the letter Z. Its unit of measurement, like that for 
resistance, is the ohm (Ω). 
Latency     1) Delay between the time a device requests access to a network and the 
time it is granted permission to transmit. 2) Delay between the time when a device 
receives a frame and the time that frame is forwarded out the destination port. 
Multimeter     A tool used to measure voltage, current, and resistance. It generally has 
two wires for that reason. The black wire is referred to as the ground, or reference 
ground. A negative terminal on a battery also is referred to as 0 volts, or reference 
ground. 
Neutrons     Particles have no charge (neutral), and along with protons, form the 
nucleus 
Oscilloscope     An important and sophisticated electronic device used to study 
electrical signals. Because it is possible to control electricity precisely, deliberate 
electrical patterns called waves can be created. An oscilloscope graphs the electrical 
waves, pulses, and patterns. It has an x-axis that represents time, and a y-axis that 
represents voltage. There are usually two y-axis voltage inputs so that two waves can 
be observed and measured at the same time.

of the wave is varied to carry the message. 
Propagation     Propagation means travel. When a NIC puts a voltage or light pulse 
onto a physical medium, that square pulse made up of waves travels along the medium 
(propagates). Propagation means that a lump of energy, representing 1 bit, travels from 
one place to another. The speed at which it propagates depends on the actual material 
used in the medium, the geometry (structure) of the medium, and the frequency of the 
pulses. 
Protons     Particles have a positive charge, and along with neutrons, form the nucleus.

Focus Questions  
1. 
What are some examples of electrical insulators? 
Electrical insulators are materials that allow electrons to flow through them with 
great difficulty or not at all. Examples of electrical insulators include plastic, 
glass, air, dry wood, paper, rubber, and helium gas. These materials have stable 
chemical structures, with orbiting electrons tightly bound within the atoms. 
2. 
What are some examples of electrical conductors?  
Electrical conductors are materials that allow electrons to flow through them with 
great ease. They flow easily because the outermost electrons are bound very 
loosely to the nucleus and are freed easily. The best conductors are metals, 
such as copper (Cu), silver (Ag), and gold (Au). All these metals are located in 
one column of the periodic table and have electrons that are freed easily, making 
them excellent materials for carrying a current. 
3. 
What are some examples of semiconductors? 
Semiconductors are materials where the amount of electricity they conduct can 
be controlled precisely. These materials are listed together in one column of the 
periodic chart. Examples include carbon (C), germanium (Ge), and the alloy 
gallium arsenide (GaAs). The most important semiconductor, the one that makes 
the best microscopic-sized electronic circuits, is silicon (Si). 
4. 
What is silicon made of? Is it an insulator, conductor, or semiconductor?  
Silicon is common and can be found in sand, glass, and many types of rocks. 
The region around San Jose, California, is known as Silicon Valley because the 
computer industry, which depends on silicon microchips, started in that area. The 
switches, or gates, inside a microprocessor are made up of semiconductors. 
5. 
Do semiconductors allow the amount of electricity to be controlled? 
Semiconductors are materials where the amount of electricity they conduct can 
be controlled precisely. 
6. 
When does voltage occur? 
Voltage, sometimes referred to as Electromotive Force (EMF), is an electrical 
force, or pressure, that occurs when electrons and protons are separated. The 
force that is created pulls toward the opposite charge and pushes away from the 
like charge. 
7. 
What is it called when static, or resting, electrons move and a flow of 
charges is created? 
Electrical current, or current, is the flow of charges that is created when electrons 
move. In electrical circuits, current is caused by a flow of free electrons. When 
voltage (electrical pressure) is applied, and there is a path for the current, 
electrons move from the negative terminal (which repels them), along the path, 
to the positive terminal (which attracts them).

8. 
What is the abbreviation for amps? 
Current is represented by the letter I. The unit of measurement for current is 
ampere (amp), and is defined as the number of charges per second that pass by 
a point along a path. 
9. 
What is the abbreviation for resistance? 
Resistance is represented by the letter R. The unit of measurement for 
resistance is the ohm. The symbol comes from the Greek letter omega  (Ω). 
10. 
What is the difference between AC and DC? 
Alternating current (AC) is one of the two ways in which current flows. AC 
voltages vary with time by changing their polarity, or direction. AC flows in one 
direction, and then reverses its direction and repeats the process. AC voltage is 
positive at one terminal and negative at the other; then, it reverses its polarity 
and the positive terminal becomes negative and the negative terminal becomes 
positive. This process repeats itself continuously. 
Direct current (DC) is the other way in which current flows. DC always flows in 
the same direction, and DC voltages always have the same polarity. One 
terminal is always positive, and the other is always negative. They do not change 
or reverse. 
11. 
How do you measure impedance? What is its abbreviation? 
Impedance is the total opposition to current flow (due to AC and DC voltages). 
The term resistance generally is used when referring to DC voltages. Impedance 
is the general term, and is the measure of how the flow of electrons is resisted, 
or impeded. Impedance is represented by the letter Z. Its unit of measurement, 
like that for resistance, is the ohm. 
12. 
What three components are necessary to make up a circuit, and how do 
they allow the control of current? 
Currents only flow in closed loops called circuits. These circuits must be 
composed of conducting materials, and must have sources of voltage. Voltage 
causes current to flow; whereas, resistance and impedance oppose it. Knowing 
these facts allows people to control a flow of current. 
13. 
What equipment do you use to graph electrical waves, pulses, and 
patterns? 
An oscilloscope graphs the electrical waves, pulses, and patterns. It has an x-
axis that represents time, and a y-axis that represents voltage. There are usually 
two y-axis voltage inputs so that two waves can be observed and measured at 
the same time.

14. 
What are some of the characteristics of an analog signal? 
An analog signal has the following characteristics: 
• 
Waviness 
• 
A continuously varying voltage-versus-time graph 
• 
Typical of things in nature 
• 
Used widely in telecommunications for more than 100 years 
The two important characteristics of a sine wave are its amplitude (A), its height 
and depth, and its period (T), which is the length of time to complete one cycle. 
You can calculate the frequency (f), wiggleyness, of the wave with the formula f 
= 1/T. 
15. 
What is the basic building block of information on a data network? 
The basic building block of information is 1 binary digit, known as the bit or 
pulse. One bit, on an electrical medium, is the electrical signal corresponding to 
binary 0 or binary 1. This can be as simple as 0 volts for binary 0, and +5 volts 
for binary 1, or a more complex encoding. Signal reference ground is an 
important concept relating to all networking media that use voltages to carry 
messages. 
16. 
What are the five sources of noise that can affect a bit on a wire? 
NEXT –A, thermal noise, impulse/reference ground noise, EMI/RFI, NEXT –B 
17. 
At what speed do modern networks typically work? 
The speed at which a network propagates depends on the actual material used 
in the medium, the geometry (structure) of the medium, and the frequency of the 
pulses. The time it takes the bit to travel from one end of the medium and back is 
referred to as the round-trip time (RTT). Assuming no other delays, the time it 
takes the bit to travel down the medium to the far end is RTT/2 The fact that the 
bit takes a small amount of time to travel along the medium does not normally 
cause network problems. However, with the ever-increasing data transmission 
rates of today’s networks, sometimes you must account for the amount of time it 
takes the signal to travel.

Layer 1: Media, Connections, and Collisions 
Introduction 
Networking media are the various physical environments through which transmission 
signals pass. For computers to communicate encoded information with each other, 
networking media must physically connect them to each other. The networking media 
used to connect computers varies. Several kinds of network media can be used to 
connect computers: 
• 
Coaxial cable 
• 
Unshielded twisted-pair cable 
• 
Shielded twisted-pair cable 
• 
Fiber-optic cable 
 
Concept Questions 
Demonstrate your knowledge of these concepts by answering the following questions in 
the space provided: 
• 
Networking media is defined as the various physical environments through which 
transmission signals pass. Several types of network media can be used to 
connect computers. Identify these different types of network media. 
The following cable types can be used to connect computers: 
⇒ 
Shielded twisted-pair cable 
⇒ 
Unshielded twisted-pair cable 
⇒ 
Coaxial cable 
⇒ 
Fiber-optic cable 
• 
Coaxial cable is a type of network media. Describe how coaxial cable is made. 
Coaxial cable is made up of a single inner wire conductor that is surrounded by a 
hollow cylindrical conductor. 
• 
UTP cable is used in a variety of networks. How many wires make up this type 
of cable? 
Unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) cable is a four-pair wire medium used in a variety 
of networks. Eight wires are contained within the outer insulation. 

 
43 - 239 
 Engineering Journal and Workbook, Vol. I, 2nd Ed. – Chapter 5  
Copyright © 2002 Cisco Systems, Inc. 
• 
STP cable combines the techniques of shielding, cancellation, and twisting of 
wires. What is shielding, and why is it important? 
Each pair of wires is wrapped in metallic foil. The four pairs of wires are wrapped 
in an overall metallic braid or foil. (It is normally 150-ohm cable.) STP reduces 
electrical noise originating inside the cable (crosstalk) and outside the cable 
(electromagnetic interference [EMI] and radio frequency interference [RFI]). 
• 
Fiber-optic cable is a networking medium. How does it carry signals? 
Fiber-optic cable is a networking medium capable of conducting modulated light 
transmission. Fiber-optic cable does not carry electrical pulses as do other forms 
of networking media that employ copper wire. Instead, signals that represent bits 
are converted into pulses of light. 
• 
Various criteria, such as rate of data transfer and expense, help determine which 
type of media should be used. What media is the fastest and which one is the 
least expensive? 
Fiber optic cabling has the fastest possible transport speed; UTP Cat 5 
represents the least expensive type of media. 
• 
The data link layer of the OSI model provides access to the networking media 
and physical transmission across the medium. If you were going to build a 
network, what media would you use and why? 
Fiber-optic cabling would be a consideration for all long distances in building-to-
building connections. A fiber-optic cabling has the capability to easily transport 
data at speeds of 10+ Gbps. UTP cabling is generally selected for most office 
connectivity where occurrences of EMI and RFI are not anticipated. In the 
industrial and warehouse environments, typically shielded twisted-pair cabling 
represents the best choice of media to avoid and EMI and RFI. Of course if 
pricing is not a concern, fiber-optic cabling is the cabling that represents the 
greatest throughput with the lowest chance of interference.

transmission. Compared with other transmission media, fiber-optic cable is more 
expensive, but is not susceptible to electromagnetic interference, and is capable of 
higher data rates. Sometimes called optical fiber.  
Hub     1) Generally, a term used to describe a device that serves as the center of a star 
topology network. 2) Hardware or software device that contains multiple independent but 
connected modules of network and internetwork equipment. Hubs can be active (where 
they repeat signals sent through them) or passive (where they do not repeat, but merely 
split, signals sent through them). 3) In Ethernet and IEEE 802.3, an Ethernet multiport 
repeater, sometimes referred to as a concentrator. 
Repeater     Device that regenerates and propagates electrical signals between two 
network segments. 
Router     Network layer device that uses one or more metrics to determine the optimal 
path along which network traffic should be forwarded. Routers forward packets from one 
network to another based on network layer information. Occasionally called a gateway 
(although this definition of gateway is becoming increasingly outdated). 
Shielded twisted-pair (STP)     Two-pair wiring medium used in a variety of network 
implementations. STP cabling has a layer of shielded insulation to reduce EMI. 
Switch     1) Network device that filters, forwards, and floods frames based on the 
destination address of each frame. The switch operates at the data link layer of the OSI 
model. 2) General term applied to an electronic or mechanical device that allows a 
connection to be established as necessary and terminated when there is no longer a 
session to support. 
Twisted pair     Relatively low-speed transmission medium consisting of two insulated 
wires arranged in a regular spiral pattern. The wires can be shielded or unshielded. 
Twisted pair is common in telephony applications and is increasingly common in data 
networks. See also STP and UTP. 
Unshielded twisted-pair (UTP)     Four-pair wire medium used in a variety of networks. 
UTP does not require the fixed spacing between connections that is necessary with 
coaxial-type connections.

Focus Questions 
1. 
Compare and contrast four different Ethernet LAN devices in increasing 
order of complexity (and typically cost). 
Repeaters     Repeaters regenerate and retime signals, thereby increasing the 
distance that signals can travel and still be clearly interpreted at the destination. 
Repeaters deal only with packets at the bit level; therefore, they are Layer 1 
devices. Repeaters are internetworking devices that exist at the physical layer 
(Layer 1) of the OSI model. 
Hubs     Hubs combine connectivity with the amplifying and retiming properties 
of repeaters. It is typical to see 4, 8, 12, and up to 24, ports on multiport 
repeaters. This allows many devices to be cheaply and easily interconnected.  
Bridges     Bridges are devices that connect and pass packets between two 
network segments that use the same communications protocol. Bridges operate 
at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI reference model. In general, a bridge 
will filter, forward, or flood an incoming frame based on the MAC address of that 
frame. 
Switches     1) Switches are network devices that filter, forward, and flood 
frames based on the destination address of each frame. The switch operates at 
the data link layer of the OSI model. 2) Switch is a general term applied to an 
electronic or mechanical device that allows a connection to be established as 
necessary and terminated when there is no longer a session to support. 
2. 
What are some of the characteristics of shielded twisted-pair (STP)? 
Shielded twisted-pair cable combines the techniques of shielding and 
cancellation via the twisting of wires. Each pair of wires is wrapped in metallic 
foil. The four pairs of wires are wrapped in an overall metallic braid or foil. (It is 
normally 150-ohm cable.) STP reduces electrical noise originating inside the 
cable (crosstalk) and outside the cable (electromagnetic interference [EMI] and 
radio frequency interference [RFI]). Shielded twisted-pair cable shares many of 
the advantages and disadvantages of unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) cable. STP 
affords greater protection from all types of external interference, but it is more 
expensive and difficult to install than UTP. 
3. 
What are some of the characteristics of unshielded twisted-pair (UTP)? 
Unshielded twisted-pair cable is a four-pair wire medium used in a variety of 
networks. Insulating material covers each of the eight individual copper wires in 
the UTP cable. In addition, each pair of wires is twisted around each other. This 
type of cable relies solely on the cancellation effect, produced by the twisted wire 
pairs, to limit signal degradation caused by EMI and RFI. To further reduce 
crosstalk between the pairs in UTP cable, the number of twists in the wire pairs 
varies. Like STP cable, UTP cable must follow precise specifications as to how 
many twists or braids are permitted per foot of cable.

4. 
What are some of the characteristics of coaxial cable? 
Coaxial cable consists of a hollow outer cylindrical conductor that surrounds a 
single inner wire conductor—the two conductors are separated by insulation. In 
the center of the cable is a single copper wire. A layer of flexible insulation 
surrounds it. Over this insulating material, a woven copper braid or metallic foil 
acts as the second of two wires in the circuit. It also acts as a shield for the inner 
conductor. This second layer, or shield, helps reduce the amount of outside 
interference. The cable jacket covers this shield. 
5. 
What is the difference between STP and UTP? 
UTP cable relies solely on the cancellation effect, produced by the twisted wire 
pairs, to limit signal degradation caused by EMI and RFI. To further reduce 
crosstalk between the pairs in UTP cable, the number of twists in the wire pairs 
varies. UTP uses 100 ohm of resistance; whereas, STP generally has 150 ohms 
of resistance. STP, unlike UTP cabling, has a metallic braid or foil that adds 
additional protection against EMI and RFI.  
6. 
What is the difference between STP and coaxial cable? 
Both STP and coaxial cable use a metallic braid or foil for added insulation. STP 
has individual shielding around each individual pair of wires. STP can transfer 
data at 100 Mbps; whereas, coaxial is limited to 10 Mbps. Coax is terminated 
using a BNC or AUI connector; whereas, STP cabling is usually terminated with 
an RJ connector. 
7. 
What is the advantage of fiber-optic cable? 
Fiber-optic cabling allows for increased distance while also having the capability 
of transferring data at a much faster rate than other types of media. Single-mode 
fiber will support 10 Gbps transmission speeds. Fiber-optic cabling is more 
secure because data cannot be extracted from the cable inductively. Fiber-optic 
cabling is also unaffected by RFI and EMI. 
8. 
What are the disadvantages of fiber-optic cable? 
The cost of fiber cabling and fiber equipment is significantly greater than that of 
twisted-pair cabling. Fiber is also very fragile and breaks easily during installation 
or thereafter. Termination and installation cost is more than double that of 
twisted-pair cabling. 
9. 
What is the medium for wireless communication? 
Wireless signals are electromagnetic waves that can travel through the vacuum 
of outer space and through media, such as the air in our atmosphere. Therefore, 
no cable medium is necessary for wireless signals. 
10. 
What are TIA/EIA standards? 
The TIA/EIA standards specify the minimum requirements for multiproduct and 
multivendor environments. They allow for the planning and the installation of 
LAN systems without dictating the use of specific equipment giving LAN 
designers the freedom to create options for improvement and expansion.

11. 
What are patch panels? 
Patch panels are convenient groupings of RJ-45 jacks. They come in 12, 24, and 
48 ports, and typically are rack mounted. The front sides are RJ-45 jacks; the 
back sides are punch-down blocks that provide connectivity or conducting paths. 
They are classified as Layer 1 components. 
12. 
How many conductors does an RJ-45 jack have? 
An RJ-45 jack/connector is made up of eight conductors, four individual pairs. 
13. 
What is a shared media environment? 
A shared media environment occurs when multiple hosts have access to the 
same medium. If several PCs are attached to the same physical wire or optical 
fiber, or share the same airspace, for example, they all share the same media 
environment. Occasionally, you might hear someone say “all the computers are 
on the same wire.” It means they all share the same media even though the 
“wire” might be CAT 5 UTP, which has four pairs of wire. 
14. 
Where on a network do collisions occur? 
If, for example, only one cable interconnects all the devices on a network, the 
possibility of conflicts with more than one user sending data at the same time is 
high. The same is true if only non-filtering devices, such as repeaters, connect 
segments of a network. Ethernet allows only one data packet to access the cable 
at any one time. If more than one node attempts to transmit at the same time, a 
collision occurs, and the data from each device suffers damage. 
15. 
What is a collision domain? 
The area within the network from where the data packets originated and collided 
is called a collision domain. All shared media environments are collision 
domains. One wire might be connected to another wire through patch cables, 
transceivers, patch panels, repeaters, and hubs. All these Layer 1 
interconnections are part of a collision domain. 
16. 
What happens to the signal in a collision? 
When a collision occurs, the data packets that are involved are destroyed, bit by 
bit. In a collision, the signals interfere, or collide, with each other and create a 
third and invalid state. 
17. 
How do you recognize a collision domain? 
If you connect several computers to a single medium that has no other 
networking devices attached, you have a shared-access situation and you have 
a single collision domain. Depending on the particular technology used, this 
situation limits the number of computers that can use that portion of the medium, 
also called a segment.

18. 
How do repeaters extend collision domains? 
Repeaters regenerate and retime bits, but they cannot filter the flow of traffic that 
passes through them. Signals that arrive at one port of a repeater are sent out 
on all other ports. The network on both sides of the repeater is one large collision 
domain. 
19. 
How do hubs extend collision domains? 
The extended collision domain introduced by a hub results in diminished network 
performance. The degradation in performance depends on the degree of usage 
of the network by the computers on that network. The hub operates just like the 
repeater with the addition of numerous nodes, thus increasing the collision 
domain. 
20. 
Do repeaters filter network traffic? 
Both repeaters and hubs are Layer 1 devices; therefore, they perform no filtering 
of network traffic. 
21. 
What is the four-repeater rule? 
The four-repeater rule in Ethernet states that no more than four repeaters or 
repeating hubs can be installed between any two computers on the network. If 
followed, the rules guarantee that if a collision occurs, every node in the collision 
domain knows it has occurred. This is crucial to the successful operation of the 
network protocol 
22. 
How can the segmentation of collision domains be achieved? 
You can reduce the size of collision domains by using intelligent networking 
devices that break up the domains. Examples of this type of networking device 
are bridges, switches, and routers. 
23. 
What is linear bus network topology? 
The bus topology has all its nodes connected directly to one link, and has no 
other connections between nodes. Each host is wired to a common wire. One 
advantage of this topology is that all hosts are connected to each other, and thus 
can communicate directly. One disadvantage of this topology is that a break in 
the cable disconnects hosts from each other. 
24. 
What is ring network topology? 
A ring topology is a single closed ring consisting of nodes and links, with each 
node connected to only two adjacent nodes. The topology shows all devices 
wired directly to each other in what is called a daisy-chain. 
25. 
Are the rings of a dual-ring network topology connected? 
The two rings are not connected. A dual-ring topology is the same as a ring 
topology, except that a second, redundant ring connects the same devices.

26. 
Where is the node of a star network topology located? 
A star topology has a central node with all links to other nodes radiating from it 
and allows no other links. 
27. 
From a mathematical perspective, where does each node link in an 
extended star network topology? 
An extended star topology has a core star topology, with each of the end nodes 
of the core topology acting as the center of its own star topology.

Layer 2: Concepts  
Introduction 
All data sent out on a network is from a source and is going to a destination. After data 
is transmitted, the data link layer of the OSI model provides access to the networking 
media and physical transmission across the media, which enables the data to locate its 
intended destination on a network. In addition, the data link layer handles error 
notification, network topology, and flow control. If you refer to the OSI model, you see 
that the data link layer is adjacent to the physical layer. The data link layer provides 
reliable transit of data across a physical link. This layer uses Media Access Control 
(MAC) addresses. In so doing, the data link layer is concerned with physical (as 
opposed to network, or logical) addressing, network topology, line discipline (how end 
systems will use the network link), error notification, ordered delivery of frames, and flow 
control. Moreover, the data link layer uses the MAC address to define a hardware or 
data link address in order for multiple stations to share the same medium and still 
uniquely identify each other. Before a data packet is exchanged with a directly 
connected device on the same LAN, the sending device needs to have a MAC address 
it can use as a destination address. 
 
Concept Questions  
Demonstrate your knowledge of these concepts by answering the following questions in 
the space provided. 
• 
Every computer, whether it is attached to a network or not, has a unique physical 
address; no two physical addresses are ever alike. How is this achieved?  
Every computer has a unique way of identifying itself. Each computer on a 
network, has a physical address. No two physical addresses on a network should 
ever be alike. Referred to as the Media Access Control address, the physical 
address is located on the network interface card (NIC). A MAC address is a 48-
bit address expressed as 12 hexadecimal digits. The first 6 hexadecimal digits of 
a MAC address contain a manufacturer identification (vendor code), also known 
as the organizationally unique identifier (OUI). The last 6 hexadecimal digits are 
administered by each vendor and often represent the interface serial number. 
The MAC address, or the physical address, is located on a NIC. Therefore, on a 
network, the NIC is where a device connects to the media.  
Each NIC, which is located in the data link layer of the OSI reference model, has 
a unique MAC address.

• 
On a network, when one device wants to send data to another device, it can 
open a communication pathway to the other device by using the other device’s 
MAC address. How is this done? 
In a unicast transmission, a single packet is sent from the source to a destination 
on a network. First, the source node addresses the packet by using the physical 
address of the destination node. The package then is sent onto the network, and 
finally, the network passes the packet to its destination. 
• 
When data is sent out on a network by a source, it carries the MAC address of 
its intended destination. Does it carry the address of the source?  
The Layer 2 frame header contains the source MAC address and the next-hop  
destination MAC address as well. The source MAC address will stay in the frame 
until the gateway or router removes the frame while routing to the next hop. 
As this data travels along the networking media, the NIC in each device on the 
network checks whether its MAC address matches the physical destination 
address carried by the data packet.  
 
Vocabulary Exercise Chapter 6 
Define the following terms as completely as you can. Use the online Chapter 6 or the 
Cisco Systems Networking Academy: First-Year Companion Guide, Second Edition, 
material for help. 
Address     Data structure or logical convention used to identify a unique entity, such as 
a particular process or network device.  
Collision domain     In Ethernet, the network area within which frames that have 
collided are propagated. Repeaters and hubs propagate collisions; LAN switches, 
bridges, and routers do not. 
CSMA/CD (carrier sense multiple access collision detect)     Media-access 
mechanism wherein devices ready to transmit data first check the channel for a carrier. 
If no carrier is sensed for a specific period of time, a device can transmit. If two devices 
transmit at once, a collision occurs and is detected by all colliding devices. This collision 
subsequently delays retransmissions from those devices for some random length of 
time. CSMA/CD access is used by Ethernet and IEEE 802.3. 
Data link layer     This layer provides reliable transit of data across a physical link. The 
data link layer is concerned with physical addressing, network topology, line discipline, 
error notification, ordered delivery of frames, and flow control. The IEEE has divided this 
layer into two sublayers: the MAC sublayer and the LLC sublayer. Sometimes just called 
link layer. 
Encapsulation     The wrapping of data in a particular protocol header. For example, 
Ethernet data is wrapped in a specific Ethernet header before network transit. Also 
when bridging dissimilar networks, the entire frame from one network is just placed in 
the header used by the data link layer protocol of the other network.

whose activities include the development of communications and network standards. 
IEEE LAN standards are the predominant LAN standards today. 
Logical link control (LLC)     Higher of the two data link layer sublayers defined by the 
IEEE. The LLC sublayer handles error control, flow control, framing, and MAC sublayer 
addressing. The most prevalent LLC protocol is IEEE 802.2, which includes both 
connectionless and connection-oriented variants. 
Media Access Control (MAC)     Lower of the two sublayers of the data link layer 
defined by the IEEE. The MAC sublayer handles access to shared media, such as 
whether token passing or contention will be used. 
Token Ring     Token-passing LAN developed and supported by IBM. Token Ring runs 
at 4 or 16 Mbps over a ring topology. Similar to IEEE 802.5. 
 
Focus Questions 
1. 
What are three differences between Layer 1 and Layer 2? 
Layer 2 of the OSI model provides access to the networking media, which 
enables the data to reach its intended destination on a network.  
⇒ 
Layer 2 provides transit of data across a physical link. 
⇒ 
Layer 2 uses a system called Media Access Control. 
⇒ 
Layer 2 uses the MAC address, which is the physical address located on 
a NIC. 
⇒ 
Layer 2 uses framing to organize or group the bits. 
The physical layer defines the electrical, mechanical, procedural, and functional 
specifications for activating, maintaining, and deactivating the physical link 
between end systems. Such characteristics as voltage levels, timing of voltage 
changes, physical data rates, maximum transmission distances, physical 
connectors, and other similar attributes are defined by physical layer 
specifications. 
3. 
Into what sublayers does the IEEE divide the OSI data link layer? 
IEEE has divided the OSI Data link layer into two sublayers: LLC (logical link 
control) and MAC (Media Access Control).

4. 
What does the LLC do to the network protocol data? 
Higher of the two data link layer sublayers defined by the IEEE, the LLC sublayer 
handles error control, flow control, framing, and MAC sublayer addressing. The 
most prevalent LLC protocol is IEEE 802.2, which includes both connectionless 
and connection-oriented variants. 
5. 
Convert the decimal number 24,032 to hex. 
5DE0 
6. 
How does a computer identify itself on a network? 
Every computer has a unique way of identifying itself. Each computer on a 
network, has a physical address, a 48-bit MAC address. 
7. 
What is the NIC’s role when data is sent out on a network? 
When a source device sends data out on a network, the data carries the MAC 
address of its intended destination. As this data propagates along the network 
media, the NIC in each device on the network checks to see whether its MAC 
address matches the physical destination address carried by the data frame. If 
there is no match, the NIC discards the data frame. 
8. 
What is an advantage and a disadvantage to MAC addresses? 
The address is burned into read-only memory and therefore cannot be lost, 
reset, or conflict with other nodes on a local network. The address is used to 
identify the node at the data link layer and is referred to as being the physical 
address. There is no hierarchy or grouping of MAC addressing other than by 
OUI.  
9. 
Which layer does framing belong to? 
The Data link layer 
10. 
What are the names of the six fields found in a single generic frame?  
⇒ 
Frame start field 
⇒ 
Address field 
⇒ 
Length / type / control field 
⇒ 
Data field 
⇒ 
Frame check sequence field 
⇒ 
Frame stop field 
 
11. 
What are the two parts of a package? 
The reason for sending frames is to get higher layer data, ultimately the user 
application data, from the source computer to the destination computer. The data 
package you want to deliver includes the message you want to send (the data). 
The padding bytes are added sometimes so the frames have a minimum 
length—this is done for timing purposes. 

 
57 - 239 
 Engineering Journal and Workbook, Vol. I, 2nd Ed. – Chapter 6  
Copyright © 2002 Cisco Systems, Inc. 
12. 
How does the frame check sum help in the delivery of a frame? 
In IEEE 802.3 frames, the 2-byte field following the source address is a length 
field, which indicates the number of bytes of data that follow this field and 
precede the frame check sequence (FCS) field. This helps identify whether the 
remote host has received all data intended for this transmission. 
13. 
How does a Token Ring network handle data? 
Token Ring networks use deterministic MAC protocols to share access to the 
network. When a host receives the token, it can transmit data, if it has some, 
instead of the token. This is called seizing the token. When the transmitted frame 
comes back around to the transmitter, the station transmits a new token. The 
frame thus is removed, or stripped, from the ring.

Layer 2: Technologies 
Introduction 
Ethernet was developed by Xerox Corporation’s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) in 
the 1970s. Ethernet is the most popular LAN standard today. There are millions of 
devices, or nodes, on Ethernet LANs. The early LANs required very little bandwidth to 
perform the simple network tasks required at that time—sending/receiving e-mail, 
transferring data files, and handling print jobs. In 1980, the Institute of Electrical and 
Electronic Engineers (IEEE) released the IEEE 802.3 specification for which Ethernet 
was the technological basis. Shortly thereafter, Digital Equipment Corporation, Intel 
Corporation, and Xerox Corporation jointly developed and released an Ethernet 
specification (version 2.0) that is substantially compatible with IEEE 802.3. Together, 
Ethernet and IEEE 802.3 currently maintain the greatest market share of any LAN 
standard. 
An Ethernet LAN transports data between network devices, such as computers, printers, 
and file servers. Ethernet is known as a shared-medium technology; all the devices are 
connected to the same delivery media. Delivery media refers to the method of 
transmitting and receiving data. For example, a handwritten letter can be sent 
(transmitted) using one of many delivery methods, such as the U.S. postal service, 
Federal Express, or fax. Electronic data can be transmitted via copper cable, thick 
coaxial cable, thinnet, wireless data transfer, and so on. 
 
Concept Questions 
Demonstrate your knowledge of these concepts by answering the following questions in 
the space provided. 
• 
Ethernet, FDDI, and Token Ring are widely used LAN technologies that account 
for virtually all deployed LANs. LAN standards specify cabling and signaling at 
the physical and data link layers of the OSI model. Because they are widely 
adhered to, this book covers the Ethernet and IEEE 802.3 LAN standards. Why 
do you suppose that Ethernet technology is so heavily used? 
Ethernet is well suited to applications in which a local communication medium 
must carry sporadic, occasionally heavy traffic at high-peak data rates. Ethernet 
was considered high-speed when it was first available

• 
When it was developed, Ethernet was designed to fill the middle ground between 
long-distance, low-speed networks and specialized, computer-room networks 
carrying data at high speeds for very limited distances. Ethernet is well suited to 
applications in which a local communication medium must carry sporadic, 
occasionally heavy traffic at high-peak data rates. Why is Ethernet so well 
suited to this kind of traffic? 
Ethernet was designed to fill the middle ground between long-distance, low-
speed networks and specialized, computer-room networks carrying data at high 
speeds for very limited distances. 
• 
Today, the term standard Ethernet refers to all networks using Ethernet (a 
shared-medium technology) that generally conform to Ethernet specifications, 
including IEEE 802.3. To use this shared-medium technology, Ethernet uses the 
carrier sense multiple access collision detection (CSMA/CD) protocol to allow the 
networking devices to negotiate for the right to transmit. What are the major 
benefits of Ethernet? 
It was designed to enable sharing resources on a local workgroup level. Design 
goals included simplicity, low cost, compatibility, fairness, low delay, and high 
speed. 
 
Vocabulary Exercise Chapter 7      
Define the following terms as completely as you can. Use the online Chapter 7 or the 
Cisco Systems Networking Academy: First-Year Companion Guide, Second Edition, 
material for help. 
Access control byte     The access control byte contains the priority and reservation 
fields, a token, and a monitor bit. The token bit distinguishes a token from a 
data/command frame, and a monitor bit determines whether a frame is continuously 
circling the ring. The end delimiter signals the end of the token or data/command frame. 
It contains bits that indicate a damaged frame, as well as bits that indicate whether a 
frame is the last of a logical sequence. 
CSMA/CD (carrier sense multiple access collision detect)     Media-access 
mechanism wherein devices ready to transmit data first check the channel for a carrier. 
If no carrier is sensed for a specific period of time, a device can transmit. If two devices 
transmit at once, a collision occurs and is detected by all colliding devices. This collision 
subsequently delays retransmissions from those devices for some random length of 
time. CSMA/CD access is used by Ethernet and IEEE 802.3. 
Data (Ethernet)     After physical layer and link layer processing is complete, the data 
contained in the frame is sent to an upper-layer protocol, which is identified in the type 
field. Although Ethernet version 2 does not specify any specific padding, in contrast to 
IEEE 802.3, Ethernet expects at least 46 bytes of data, like 802.3. 
Data (IEEE 802.3)     After physical layer and link layer processing is complete, the data 
is sent to an upper-layer protocol, which must be defined within the data portion of the 
frame. If data in the frame is insufficient to fill the frame to its minimum 64-byte size, 
padding bytes are inserted to ensure at least a 64-byte frame.

Destination and source addresses     The first 3 bytes of the addresses are specified 
by the IEEE on a vendor-dependent basis. The last 3 bytes are specified by the 
Ethernet or IEEE 802.3 vendor. The source address is always a unicast (single-node) 
address. The destination address can be unicast, multicast (group), or broadcast (all 
nodes). 
End delimiter     The end delimiter signals the end of the token or data/command 
frame. It contains bits that indicate a damaged frame, as well as bits that indicate 
whether a frame is the last of a logical sequence. 
Ethernet     Baseband LAN specification invented by Xerox Corporation and developed 
jointly by Xerox, Intel, and Digital Equipment Corporation. Ethernet networks use 
CSMA/CD and run over a variety of cable types at 10 Mbps. Ethernet is similar to the 
IEEE 802.3 series of standards. 
FDDI (Fiber Distributed Data Interface)     LAN standard, defined by ANSI X3T9.5, 
specifying a 100-Mbps token-passing network using fiber-optic cable, with transmission 
distances of up to 2 kilometers. FDDI uses a dual-ring architecture to provide 
redundancy. 
Frame check sequence (FCS)     This sequence contains a 4-byte CRC value that is 
created by the sending device and is recalculated by the receiving device to check for 
damaged frames. 
IEEE 802.3     IEEE LAN protocol that specifies an implementation of the physical layer 
and the MAC sublayer of the data link layer. IEEE 802.3 uses CSMA/CD access at a 
variety of speeds over a variety of physical media. Extensions to the IEEE 802.3 
standard specify implementations for Fast Ethernet. 
Length (IEEE 802.3)     The Length field indicates the number of bytes of data that 
follows this field. 
Microsegmentation     Division of a network into smaller segments, usually with the 
intention of increasing aggregate bandwidth to network devices. 
MSAU (multistation access unit)     Wiring concentrator to which all end stations in a 
Token Ring network connect. The MSAU provides an interface between these devices 
and the Token Ring interface of, for example, a Cisco 7000 TRIP. Sometimes 
abbreviated MAU. 
NIC (network interface card)     Board that provides network communication 
capabilities to and from a computer system. Also called an adapter. 
Preamble      The purpose of the preamble is synchronization. The Ethernet frame 
includes an additional byte that is the equivalent of the Start of Frame (SOF) field 
specified in the IEEE 802.3 frame. 
Router     Network layer device that uses one or more metrics to determine the optimal 
path along which network traffic should be forwarded. Routers forward packets from one 
network to another based on network layer information. Occasionally called a gateway 
(although this definition of gateway is becoming increasingly outdated). 
Start delimiter     The start delimiter alerts each station to the arrival of a token, or 
data/command frame. This field also includes bit patterns that distinguish the byte from 
the rest of the frame by violating the encoding scheme used elsewhere in the frame.

Focus Questions 
1. 
What is the size and composition of a token? 
Tokens are 3 bytes in length and consist of a start delimiter, an access control 
byte, and an end delimiter. 
2. 
What does the source address field in an FDDI frame identify? 
The source address identifies the single station that sent the frame; source 
addresses are 6 bytes (like Ethernet and Token Ring). 
3. 
Which field determines whether the frame contains asynchronous or 
synchronous data?  
The Frame Control field indicates the size of the address fields, whether the 
frame contains asynchronous or synchronous data, and other control information  
4. 
What are two features that are both FDDI and Token Ring share? 
The two networks share a few features, such as topology (ring) and media 
access technique (token passing).  
5. 
What are the three advantages that optical fiber has over copper wiring? 
Optical fiber offers several advantages over traditional copper wiring, including 
such advantages as these: 
⇒ Security. Fiber does not emit electrical signals that can be tapped.  
⇒ Reliability. Fiber is immune to electrical interference.  
⇒ Speed. Optical fiber has much higher throughput potential than copper cable.  
6. 
What network device must all network traffic pass through on a star 
topology? 
When a star topology is used, communication between devices attached to the 
LAN is via point-to-point wiring to the central link or hub. All network traffic in a 
star topology passes through the hub. 
7. 
What is the purpose of a NIC? 
A network interface card  is a Layer 2 device that plugs into a motherboard and 
provides ports for network connection. This card can be designed as an Ethernet 
card, a Token Ring card, or an FDDI card. Network cards communicate with the 
network through serial connections and with the computer through parallel 
connections. They are the physical connections from workstations to the 
network.

8. 
What are two reasons why LANs are segmented? 
The primary reason for segmenting a LAN is to isolate traffic between segments 
and to achieve more bandwidth per user by creating smaller collision domains. 
Segmentation also accommodates communication between a larger number of 
devices than could be supported on any single LAN connection. 
9. 
Ethernet uses which access method to detect errors within data packets or 
on the network?  
Ethernet uses CSMA/CD, a media-access mechanism wherein devices ready to 
transmit data first check the channel for a carrier. If no carrier is sensed for a 
specific period of time, a device can transmit. If two devices transmit at once, a 
collision occurs and is detected by all colliding devices. This collision 
subsequently delays retransmissions from those devices for some random 
length of time. CSMA/CD access is used by Ethernet and IEEE 802.3. 
10. 
Why is it cost efficient to have a switched LAN environment? 
A switched Ethernet LAN allows a LAN topology to work faster and more 
efficiently than a standard Ethernet LAN can because it uses bandwidth so 
efficiently. In a switched Ethernet implementation, the available bandwidth can 
reach close to 100 percent.

Design and Documentation 
Introduction 
Of all the organizations mentioned here, the EIA/TIA has had the greatest impact on 
networking media standards. The EIA/TIA standards were developed with the intent of 
identifying minimum requirements that would support multiproduct and multivendor 
environments. Moreover, these standards were developed so that they allow for 
planning and installation of LAN systems without knowledge of the specific equipment 
that is to be installed. Therefore, the EIA/TIA standards allow the LAN designer options 
and room for expansion. Specifically, the EIA/TIA-568B standards for technical 
performance of the networking media have been, and continue to be, the most widely 
used. The EIA/TIA standards address six elements of cabling for LAN systems: 
horizontal cabling, telecommunications closets, backbone cabling, equipment rooms, 
work areas, and entrance facilities. 
EIA/TIA-568B defines horizontal cabling as a networking medium that runs from the 
telecommunications outlet to the horizontal cross-connect. This element includes the 
networking medium that is run along a horizontal pathway, the telecommunications 
outlet or connector, the mechanical terminations in the wiring closet, and the patch 
cords or jumpers in the wiring closet. In short, horizontal cabling describes the 
networking medium that is used in the area extending from the wiring closet to a 
workstation. 
After you successfully run cable in a horizontal cabling run, connections must be made 
in the wiring closet. A wiring closet is a specially designed room used for wiring a data or 
voice network. Because a wiring closet serves as a central junction point for the wiring 
and wiring equipment that is used for connecting devices in a LAN, it is at the center 
point of a star topology. Typically, the equipment found in a wiring closet can include 
patch panels, wiring hubs, bridges, switches, and routers. 
Generally, the wiring closet must be large enough to accommodate the equipment and 
wiring located in it. Naturally, this varies with the size of the LAN and the types of 
equipment required to operate it. Equipment required for some small LANs might take 
up as little space as a large filing cabinet; whereas, a large LAN could require a full-
fledged computer room. Finally, the wiring closet must be large enough to accommodate 
future growth.

Concept Questions 
Demonstrate your knowledge of these concepts by answering the following questions in 
the space provided. 
• 
EIA/TIA standards govern the type of networking media that can be used in the 
horizontal cabling of LANs. What type of networking media can be used with 
horizontal cabling? 
The TIA/EIA recommends the use of Cat 5 or 5e UTP for horizontal cabling 
when an Ethernet LAN uses a simple star topology. 
• 
Any time you install cable, it is important to document what you have done. How 
would you document the kind of cable used in a network? 
All cable runs should be documented on a cut sheet, usually located for 
reference at the supporting IDF. 
• 
A wiring closet is a specially designed room used for wiring a data or voice network. 
What attributes are necessary for a working wiring closet? 
The wiring closet must be large enough to accommodate all the equipment and 
wiring that will be placed in it and account for future growth. 
• 
The IEEE and the EIA/TIA have established standards that enable you to evaluate 
whether your network is operating at an acceptable level after installation has been 
completed. What are some of those standards? 
EIA/TIA-568 is a standard that describes the characteristics and applications for 
various grades of UTP cabling. 
TIA/EIA-569 is a standard that specifies the wiring closet requirements. 
• 
Cable testers can perform tests that measure the overall capability of a cable run. 
Cable testers use a feature called wire map to indicate which wire pairs connect to 
what pins on lugs and sockets. Describe how you would use a cable tester to 
measure the capability of the cable run. 
It is important to measure the overall length of cable runs. Distance can affect 
the capability of devices on the network that share the networking media. As you 
have already learned, cable that exceeds the maximum length specified by 
TIA/EIA-568-A causes signal degradation. Cable testers, sometimes referred to 
as time domain reflectometers (TDRs), measure the distance to open-ended, or 
shorted, cable. They do it by sending an electrical pulse through the cable. The 
devices then time the signal’s reflection from the end of the cable. This test is 
called time domain reflectometry, and can provide distance readings that are 
accurate to within 61 centimeters. 
• 
If not properly addressed, AC power-line noise can present problems for a network. 
Why does the noise cause problems for the network? 
If the resulting electrical noise reaches a high enough level, it can become 
difficult for NICs to discriminate the noise from the data signal. This is particularly 
a problem because most LANs use frequencies in the 1–100 megahertz (MHz) 
frequency region, which happens to be where FM radio signals, TV signals, and 
lots of appliances have their operating frequencies as well.

minimum capability of 4.8 kPA (100lb/ft2). Where the wiring closet serves as an 
IDF, the floor must be capable of bearing a minimum load of 2.4 kPA (50lb/ft2). 
3. 
What problem could result if the humidity level in the MDF is above 50 
percent? 
Relative humidity should be maintained at a level between 30 and 50 percent. 
Failure to adhere to these particular specifications could result in serious 
corrosion of the copper wires that are contained within the UTP and STP cable. 
Such corrosion would diminish the efficient functioning of the network. 
4. 
Why should fluorescent lighting be avoided in a wiring closet? 
Lighting requirements for a telecommunications closet specify a minimum of 500 
lx (brightness of light equal to 50-foot candles) and specify that light fixtures be 
mounted a minimum of 2.6 meters above the floor. 
5. 
What types of devices might be connected to a network? 
Repeaters, hubs, bridges, switches, clients, servers, printers, and routers. 
6. 
What is the difference between and MDF and an IDF? 
A good way to start looking for a potential wiring closet location is to identify 
secure locations that are close to the POP. The selected location can serve as 
either the sole wiring closet or the MDF. The MDF acts as the central wiring 
closet that will connect to all remote wiring closets (IDFs) through vertical 
cabling.

7. 
Is one wiring closet adequate for a multibuilding campus? 
One wiring closet is required for each building, and each floor within that 
building. If a campus environment has eight buildings, the absolute minimum 
number of wiring closets would be eight. 
8. 
What is the difference between and normal-mode problem and a common-
mode problem? 
If a problem exists between the hot and neutral wire, this is referred to as a 
normal-mode problem. If a situation involves either the hot or neutral wire and 
the safety ground wire, it is referred to as a common-mode problem.  
9. 
Why is a common-mode problem more serious than a normal-mode 
problem? 
Normal-mode problems do not ordinarily pose a hazard to you or to your 
computer. This is because they are usually intercepted by a computer’s power 
supply, an uninterruptible power supply, or an AC power-line filter. Common-
mode problems, on the other hand, can go directly to a computer’s chassis 
without an intervening filter. Therefore, they can do more damage to data signals 
than normal-mode problems. 
10. 
What is a surge? 
A surge is any voltage increase above 110 percent of the normal voltage carried 
by a power line. 
11. 
What is a sag? 
A sag is any decrease of below 80 percent in the normal voltage carried by a 
power line. A sag is sometimes referred to as a brownout. 
12. 
What is a spike? 
A spike is any power impulse lasting between .5 and 100 microseconds and 
possessing an amplitude over 100 percent of peak power-line voltage.

Structured Cabling Project 
Introduction 
After the decision is made to network computers in a building, one of the first things you 
must address is where the wiring closet will be located. To determine where the wiring 
closet will be located, it will help to think of the hub as the center point of a circle with 
lines of horizontal cabling radiating out from it like spokes from the center of a wheel. 
Then, locate all the devices that will be connected to the network on a floor plan of the 
building that is drawn approximately to scale. As you do this, remember that computers 
will not be the only devices you will want to connect to the network. You also must 
consider the location of printers and file servers that will be part of the network. 
When you connect cable to jacks, remember to strip back only as much of the cable’s 
jacket as is required to terminate the wires. The more wire that is exposed, the poorer 
the connection is. This exposure results in signal loss. In addition, maintain the twists in 
each pair of wires as close as possible to the point of termination. It is the twisting of the 
wires that produces cancellation, which is needed to prevent radio and electromagnetic 
interference. For Category 4 UTP, the maximum amount of untwisting that is allowed is 
1 inch. For Category 5 UTP, the maximum amount of untwisting that is allowed is ½ 
inch.  
If multiple cables are run over the same path, use cable ties to cinch them together. 
When cable ties are needed to mount or secure cable, be sure to apply cable ties so 
they can slide a little. Position ties at random intervals along the cable. Never secure the 
cable ties too tightly; such tightness can damage the cable. When securing the cable 
ties, try to minimize the amount of jacket twisting. If cable is twisted too much, it can 
lead to torn cable jackets.  
Never allow the cable to be pinched or kinked. If this occurs, data moves more slowly 
and your LAN operates at less than optimal capacity.  
When handling the cable, avoid stretching it. If you exceed 25 pounds of pull, wires 
inside the cable can untwist. As you have learned, if wire pairs become untwisted, this 
can lead to interference and crosstalk. Above all, never cut corners with cable. It is 
important to leave ample slack. Remember, a few feet of extra cable is a small price to 
pay to avoid having to redo a cable run because of mistakes resulting in stretched cable. 
Most cable installers avoid this problem by leaving enough slack so that the cable can 
reach the floor and extend another two or three feet at both ends of the cable. Other 
installers follow the practice of leaving a service coil, which is nothing more than a few 
extra feet of cable left coiled up inside the ceiling or in another out-of-the-way location.  
Use appropriate and recommended techniques for dressing and securing the cable. 
These include cable ties, cable support bars, wire management panels, and releasable 
Velcro straps. Never use a staple gun to position cables. Staples can pierce the jacket, 
which results in loss of connection.

Concept Questions 
Demonstrate your knowledge of these concepts by answering the following questions in 
the space provided. 
• 
Generally speaking, the wiring closet must be large enough to accommodate the 
equipment and wiring located in it. How do you determine how large the 
closet should be? 
TIA/EIA-568-A specifies that, in an Ethernet LAN, the horizontal cabling runs 
must be attached to a central point in a star topology. The central point is the 
wiring closet, where the patch panel and the hub must be installed. The wiring 
closet must be large enough to accommodate all of the equipment and wiring 
that will be placed in it and account for future growth. Naturally, the size of the 
closet will vary with the size of the LAN and the types of equipment required to 
operate it. Equipment required for some small LANs might take up as little space 
as a large filing cabinet; whereas, a large LAN could require a full-fledged 
computer room.  
• 
The wiring closet must be large enough to accommodate future growth. How do 
you estimate the future growth of a network?  
Attempt to estimate how many future network segments and remote LAN 
segments will need to be attached in the future. Is there any plan to expand into 
a multiple floor building? Are there any merger or acquisitions plans for the 
future?  
• 
EIA/TIA-569 specifies that there be a minimum of one wiring closet per floor and 
states that additional wiring closets should be provided for each area up to 1000 
square meters when the floor area served exceeds 1000 square meters or the 
horizontal cabling distance exceeds 90 meters. Hint: 1000 square meters equals 
10,000 square feet; 90 meters equals approximately 300 feet. 
• 
Anytime you install cable, it is important to document what you have done. 
Therefore, as you install cable, be sure to make a cut sheet. A cut sheet is a 
rough diagram that shows where cable runs are. It also indicates what the 
numbers of the schoolrooms, offices, or other rooms are where the cable runs 
lead to. Draw and document the cabling for a small LAN. Include three 
terminals in three different rooms and provide for Internet access. 
Students should sketch a small diagram using the correct symbols representing 
each LAN/WAN device. Look for horizontal cabling, patch panels, keystone 
jacks… 
Later, you can refer to this cut sheet so that corresponding numbers can be 
placed on all telecommunications outlets and at the patch panel in the wiring 
closet. You can use a page in your journal to document cable runs. By placing it 
in your journal, you have an additional layer of documentation for any cable 
installation.

• 
EIA/TIA-606 specifies that some kind of unique identifier must be given to each 
hardware termination unit. This identifier must be marked on each termination 
hardware unit or on its label. When identifiers are used at the work area, station 
terminations must be labeled on the faceplate housing, or on the connector itself. 
Whether they are adhesive or insertable, all labels must meet legibility, 
defacement, and adhesion requirements. Label the drawing that you did 
earlier in this exercise with the identifier to each hardware termination unit. 
Students should now provide details to the diagram that they had sketched. 
Termination endpoints include patch panels and keystone jacks.

Focus Questions 
1. 
Where are patch cables plugged into?  
Patch cords connect to patch panel ports, making it possible to interconnect 
computers and other network devices (such as hubs, repeaters, and routers).  
2. 
Think about the cabling in this building. What factors would the person 
laying cable have to keep in mind? How would someone keep track of all 
the cables? 
The cable installer needs to pay attention to safety standards, sources of 
potential noise (motors, light fixtures, and so on), and general wiring standards 
identified by TIA/EIA. Whenever you install cable, it is important that you 
document your actions. You can do this by using a cut sheet as you install the 
cable. A cut sheet is a rough diagram that shows the locations of the cable runs. 
It also indicates the numbers of the classrooms, offices, or other rooms to which 
the cables have been run. 
3. 
How do you determine whether cable has been properly installed?  
The IEEE and the TIA/EIA have established standards that enable you to test 
whether your network is operating at an acceptable level. If your network passes 
this test and is certified as meeting the standards, you can use this 
measurement as an established baseline. The baseline is a record of your 
network’s starting point or newly installed performance capabilities. 
4. 
What do you call an assembly of pin locations and ports that can be 
mounted on a rack? 
A patch panel. Found in both the MDF and IDF.

5. 
What type of vertical cabling connects the central hub to other hubs in a 
hierarchical star topology?  
Vertical cabling usually consists of single or multimode fiber. If the central hub 
and other hubs are within 90 meters and on the same floor and earth ground, 
then Cat 5 or Cat 5e is also a suitable choice. 
6. 
What type of tool is used to measure attenuation of a signal on a network? 
A cable tester can measure the reduction in power of a signal received from a 
device known as a signal injector, a small box approximately the size of a deck 
of playing cards that is attached to the far end of a cable. Cable testers generally 
measure attenuation at several frequencies.

Layer 3: Routing and Addressing 
Introduction 
The network layer interfaces to networks and provides the best end-to-end packet 
delivery services to its user, the transport layer. The network layer sends packets from 
the source network to the destination network. 
Routers are devices that implement the network service. They provide interfaces for a 
wide range of links and subnetworks at a wide range of speeds. Routers are active and 
intelligent network nodes and thus can participate in managing the network. Routers 
manage networks by providing dynamic control over resources and supporting the tasks 
and goals for networks: connectivity, reliable performance, management control, and 
flexibility. 
In addition to the basic switching and routing functions, routers have implemented a 
variety of value-added features that help to improve the cost-effectiveness of the 
network. These features include sequencing traffic based on priority and traffic filtering. 
Typically, routers are required to support multiprotocol stacks, each with its own routing 
protocols, and to allow these different environments to operate in parallel. In practice, 
routers also incorporate bridging functions and can serve as a limited form of hub. 
IP addressing makes it possible for data passing over the network media of the Internet 
to find its destination. Because each IP address is a 32-bit value, there are four billion 
different IP address possibilities. IP addresses are hierarchical addresses, like phone 
numbers and zip codes. They provide a better way to organize computer addresses 
than MAC addresses, which are flat addresses (like social security numbers). IP 
addresses can be set in software and are therefore flexible. MAC addresses are burned 
into hardware. Both addressing schemes are important for efficient communications 
between computers. 
 
Concept Questions 
Demonstrate your knowledge of these concepts by answering the following questions in 
the space provided. 
• 
Path determination occurs at the network layer. Routers are another type of 
internetworking device. These devices pass data packets between networks 
based on network protocol or Layer 3 information. Explain how this process 
works. 
Routers use logical addressing to made routing decisions. When a packet is 
received by a router, it pulls of Layer 2 frame encapsulation and analyses the 
Layer 3 header. It uses this destination address along with its routing table to 
determine the best path and ultimately the next hop. 

 
92 - 239 
 Engineering Journal and Workbook, Vol. I, 2nd Ed. – Chapter 10  Copyright © 2002 Cisco Systems, Inc. 
• 
Routers have the capability to make intelligent decisions as to the best path for 
delivery of data on the network. What criteria do they use to make these 
decisions? 
Routers share information with other routers, educating one another about 
known networks within the internetwork. The router uses this table, almost like a 
network roadmap. When requested to forward a packet, the router refers to this 
map/table and forwards the packet to the next appropriate interface and 
neighbor. 
• 
IP addresses are 32-bit values written as four octets separated with periods. To 
make them easier to remember, IP addresses are usually written in dotted 
notation using decimal numbers. IP addresses are used to identify a machine on 
a network and the network to which it is attached. What do each of the 
numbers mean? 
Dotted-decimal notation allows for easier identification of the IP address. Each 
decimal number (octet) represents 8 individual bits. Those bits are used to 
represent either the host or network portion of this unique address. The subnet 
mask actually indicates whether the bit is representative of the host or network. 
Hexadecimal is a Base 16 numbering system that is used to represent MAC addresses. 
It is referred to as Base 16 because it uses 16 symbols; combinations of these symbols 
can then represent all possible numbers. Because only 10 symbols represent digits (0, 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), and Base 16 requires 6 more symbols, the extra symbols are the 
letters A, B, C, D, E, and F. 
The position of each symbol, or digit, in a hex number represents the base number 16 
raised to a power, or exponent, based on its position. Moving from right to left, the first 
position represents 160, or 1; the second position represents 161, or 16; the third 
position, 162, or 256; and so on. 
Example: 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A  B C D E  F 
4F6A = (4 x 163) + (F[15] x 162) + (6 x 161) + (A[10] x 160) 
Convert Decimal to Hex 
Converting from decimal to binary is done with a procedure called the remainder 
method. This method uses successive divisions of the base number of the system. You 
can use the same method to convert decimal into hex, or Base 16. 
Example: 
24,032 / 16 = 16 into 24,032 is 1502, with a remainder of 0 
1502 / 16  
= 16 into 1502 is 93, with a remainder of 14, or E 
93 / 16 =  
16 into 93 is 5, with a remainder of 13, or D 
13 / 16 =  
16 into 13 is 0, with a remainder of 3 
Collecting all the remainders backward returns the hex number 3DE0.

Hex number = 181CC 
54,462

Convert Hex to Decimal 
Convert hexadecimal numbers to decimal numbers by multiplying the hex digits by the 
base number of the system, in this case, Base 16, raised to the exponent of the 
position. 
Example: 
Convert the hex number 3F4B to decimal. (Work from right to left.)

Vocabulary Exercise Chapter 10  
Define the following terms as completely as you can. Use the online Chapter 10 or the 
Cisco Systems Networking Academy: First-Year Companion Guide, Second Edition, 
material for help. 
Segment     1) Section of a network that is bounded by bridges, routers, or switches. 2) 
In a LAN using a bus topology, a segment is a continuous electrical circuit that is often 
connected to other such segments with repeaters. 3) Term used in the TCP 
specification to describe a single transport layer unit of information. 
Internet service providers (ISPs)     Companies that offer services that tie together 
multiple network segments. 
Router     Network layer device that uses one or more metrics to determine the optimal 
path along which network traffic should be forwarded. Routers forward packets from one 
network to another based on network layer information. Occasionally called a gateway 
(although this definition of gateway is becoming increasingly outdated). 
Address     Data structure or logical convention used to identify a unique entity, such as 
a particular process or network device. 
IP (Internet Protocol)       Network layer protocol in the TCP/IP stack offering a 
connectionless internetwork service. IP provides features for addressing, type-of-service 
specification, fragmentation and reassembly, and security. Documented in RFC 791. 
Broadcast address     Special address reserved for sending a message to all stations. 
Generally, a broadcast address is a MAC destination address of all 1s. 
Subnetwork     In IP networks, a network sharing a particular subnet address. 
Subnetworks are networks arbitrarily segmented by a network administrator to provide a 
multilevel, hierarchical routing structure while shielding the subnetwork from the 
addressing complexity of attached networks. Sometimes called a subnet. 
Subnet mask     A 32-bit address mask used in IP to indicate the bits of an IP address 
that are being used for the subnet address. Sometimes referred to simply as mask. 
 
Focus Questions 
1. 
What type of addressing scheme does the network layer address use? 
Logical addressing occurs at the network layer. The network layer address has 
both network and host representation; because of this, Layer 3 addresses are 
said to be hierarchical. 
2. 
The Internet is a collection of network segments that are tied together to 
facilitate the sharing of information. What specific internetworking device 
that operates at Layer 3 interconnects networks? 
Routers allow for the interconnection of several unique segments. 

 
95 - 239 
 Engineering Journal and Workbook, Vol. I, 2nd Ed. – Chapter 10  Copyright © 2002 Cisco Systems, Inc. 
3. 
What type of determination is the process the router uses to choose a 
course for the packet to travel to its destination? 
Path determination is the process that a router uses to choose the next hop in a 
path toward a packet’s ultimate destination. 
4. 
At what layer does addressing occur? 
A network address helps the router identify a path within the network cloud. The 
router uses the network address to identify the destination network of a packet 
within an internetwork. In addition to the network address, network protocols use 
some form of host, or node, address. For some network layer protocols, a 
network administrator assigns host addresses according to some predetermined 
network addressing plan. 
5. 
When a computer is moved to a different network, what type of address 
remains the same and what type of address must be reassigned? 
When you physically move a computer to a different network, the computer 
maintains the same MAC address, but you must assign it a new network layer 
address. 
6. 
What is the difference between a flat addressing scheme and a hierarchical 
addressing scheme? 
Protocols that support the network layer use a hierarchical addressing scheme 
that allows for unique addresses across network boundaries, along with a 
method for finding a path for data to travel between networks. MAC addresses 
use a flat addressing scheme that makes it difficult to locate devices on other 
networks. Hierarchical addressing, on the other hand, not only enables 
information flow through an internetwork, but it also provides an efficient means 
of doing so. 
Flat addressing does not allow for the grouping of multiple devices based upon 
some common characteristic, such as department, floor, company, city, and so 
on. 
7. 
In the IP header, what information does the “total length” contain? 
Specifies the length of the entire IP packet, including data and header, in two 
bytes (16 bits). 
8. 
What three pieces of information does the subnet mask give to network 
devices? 
The subnet mask allows the host to identify the size of the network on which it is 
participating. The subnet mask also allows for the identification of a network 
address (all 0s in the Host field) and the identification of the broadcast address 
(all 1s in the Host field). 
9. 
How many hosts can be assigned to a Class C network? 
A Class C network contains 256 host addresses. The first (.0) and the last (.255) 
are reserved, leaving 254 host IP addresses available for assignment.

Chapter 11 
Layer 3: Protocols 
Introduction 
Protocols determine whether data is passed beyond the network layer to higher levels of 
the OSI model. Basically, for this to occur, the data packet must contain both a 
destination MAC address and a destination IP address. If it lacks one or the other, the 
data does not pass to the upper levels. In this way, MAC addresses and IP addresses 
act as a sort of “check and balance” for each other. 
 
Concept Questions 
Demonstrate your knowledge of these concepts by answering the following questions in 
the space provided. 
• 
If the destination is to retain the data and pass it along to the upper layers of the 
OSI model, the source must use both a destination MAC address and a 
destination IP address. Therefore, the device initiates a process called an ARP 
request that is designed to help it discover what the destination MAC address is. 
How does the device know to initiate the ARP request? 
Whenever a network device wants to send data across a network, it uses 
information provided by its ARP table. If it is cannot locate a MAC address for 
the destination IP address in its ARP table, the host initiates a process called an 
ARP request.  
• 
The protocol that a device uses when it does not know its own IP address is the 
Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP). Like ARP, RARP binds MAC 
addresses to IP addresses so that network devices can use them to encapsulate 
data before sending it out on the network. Can you explain how this works? 
RARP binds MAC addresses to IP addresses. This binding allows network 
devices to encapsulate data before sending them out on the network. A network 
device, such as a diskless workstation, might know its MAC address but not its 
IP address. Devices using RARP require that a RARP server be present on the 
network to answer RARP requests.

suite of protocols developed by the U.S. Department of Defense in the 1970s to support 
the construction of worldwide internetworks. TCP and IP are the two best-known 
protocols in the suite. See also IP and TCP.  
 
Focus Questions 
1. 
What are the two addressing schemes in networking? 
In networking there are two addressing schemes: One uses the MAC address, a 
data link or Layer 2 address; the other uses an address located at the network 
layer, or Layer 3 of the OSI model.  
2. 
When making forwarding decisions, what type of addresses do routers 
use? 
Routers use a Layer 3 addressing scheme make forwarding decisions. They use 
IP or logical addresses rather than MAC addresses.  
3. 
A router’s attachment to a network is called an interface, which can also be 
referred to as what? 
A router’s attachment to a network is called an interface; it also may be referred 
to as a port. In IP routing, each interface must have a separate, unique network 
(or subnetwork) address.  
4. 
What protocol does a device use to obtain an IP address when it starts up? 
A device uses BOOTstrap Protocol, when it starts up, to obtain an IP address. 
BOOTP uses UDP to carry messages; the UDP message is encapsulated in an 
IP datagram.  
5. 
When devices communicate, what suite is used to automatically detect the 
MAC address? 
For devices to communicate, the sending devices need both the IP addresses 
and the MAC addresses of the destination devices. When they try to 
communicate with devices whose IP addresses they know, they must determine 
the MAC addresses. The TCP/IP suite has a protocol that can automatically 
detect the MAC address (ARP). ARP enables a computer to find the MAC 
address of the computer that is associated with an IP address.

6. 
When a router receives a frame, what happens to the frame header and the 
IP header? 
At the data link layer, an IP datagram is encapsulated into a frame. The 
datagram, including the IP header, is treated as data. A router receives the 
frame, strips off the frame header, and then checks the destination IP address in 
the IP header.  
7. 
Do most network services use connectionless or connection-oriented 
delivery systems? 
Most network services use a connectionless delivery system. They treat each 
packet separately, and send it on its way through the network. The packets may 
take different paths to get through the network, but are reassembled when they 
arrive at the destination. In a connectionless system, the destination is not 
contacted before a packet is sent.  
In connection-oriented systems, a connection is established between the sender 
and the recipient before any data is transferred. An example of a connection-
oriented network is the telephone system. A call is placed, a connection is 
established, and then communication occurs. 
8. 
What is the difference between EIGRP and IGRP? 
EIGRP is an advanced version of IGRP. Specifically, EIGRP provides superior 
operating efficiency and combines the advantages of link-state protocols with 
those of distance-vector protocols. 
When a source resides on a network that has a different network number than 
that of the desired destination, and when it does not know the MAC address of 
the destination, it must use the services of a router, for its data to reach the 
destination. A router that is used for this purpose is called a default gateway.  
9. 
What is the most common method to transfer routing protocols between 
routers on the same network? 
The most common method, within a network, to transfer routing information 
between routers that are located on the same network, is RIP.

Chapter 12 
Layer 4: The Transport Layer 
Introduction 
Services located in the transport layer, which is Layer 4 of the OSI reference model, 
enable users to segment several upper-layer applications onto the same Layer 4 data 
stream. These services also allow for the reassembly of the same upper-layer 
application segments at the receiving end. 
The Layer 4 data stream provides transport services from the host to the destination. 
Services such as these are sometimes referred to as end-to-end services. The Layer 4 
data stream is a logical connection between the endpoints of a network. 
As the transport layer sends its data segments, it can also ensure the integrity of the 
data. One method of doing this is called flow control. Flow control avoids the problem of 
a host at one side of the connection overflowing the buffers in the host at the other side. 
Overflows can present serious problems because they can result in data loss. 
Transport-layer services also allow users to request reliable data transport between 
hosts and destinations. To obtain such reliable transport of data, a connection-oriented 
relationship is used between the communicating end systems. Reliable transport can 
accomplish the following: 
• 
It ensures that segments delivered will be acknowledged back to the sender. 
• 
It provides for retransmission of any segments that are not acknowledged. 
• 
It puts segments back into their correct sequence at the destination. 
• 
It provides congestion avoidance and control. 
 
Concept Questions 
Demonstrate your knowledge of these concepts by answering the following questions in 
the space provided. 
• 
For data transfer to begin, both the sending and receiving application programs 
inform their respective operating systems that a connection will be initiated. How is 
this accomplished?  
One user of the transport layer must establish a connection-oriented session with its 
peer system. For data transfer to begin, both the sending and the receiving 
applications inform their respective operating systems that a connection will be 
initiated. One machine initiates a connection that must be accepted by the other. 
Protocol software modules in the two operating systems communicate by sending 
messages across the network to verify that the transfer is authorized and that both 
sides are ready.

• 
In concept, one machine places a call that must be accepted by the other. If the 
receiving machine does not accept the call, what happens? 
If the receiving machine does not accept the call, a session is not established. 
The transport of data will not be allowed to be attempted. 
• 
Protocol software modules in the two operating systems communicate by 
sending messages. Messages are sent across the network to verify that the 
transfer is authorized and that both sides are ready. How is this 
accomplished? 
Protocol software modules in the two operating systems communicate by 
sending messages across the network to verify that the transfer is authorized 
and that both sides are ready. 
After all synchronization has occurred, a connection is said to be established and 
the transfer of data begins. During transfer, the two machines continue to 
communicate with their protocol software to verify that data is received correctly. 
• 
After all synchronization occurs, a connection is established, and data transfer 
begins. How do both machines know that the data is flowing correctly? 
If the sender must wait for an acknowledgment after sending each segment, 
throughput is low. Therefore, most connection-oriented, reliable protocols allow 
more than one frame or segment to be outstanding at a time. Because time is 
available after the sender finishes transmitting the data packet and before the 
sender finishes processing any received acknowledgment, the interval is used 
for transmitting more data.

Cisco Systems Networking Academy: First-Year Companion Guide, Second Edition, 
material for help. 
Best-effort delivery     Describes a network system that does not use a sophisticated 
acknowledgment system to guarantee reliable delivery of information. 
ES (end system)     1) Generally, an end-user device on a network. 2) Nonrouting host 
or node in an OSI network. 
Flow control     Technique for ensuring that a transmitting entity, such as a modem, 
does not overwhelm a receiving entity with data. When the buffers on the receiving 
device are full, a message is sent to the sending device to suspend the transmission 
until the data in the buffers has been processed. In IBM networks, this technique is 
called pacing.  
Full duplex     Capability for simultaneous data transmission between a sending station 
and a receiving station. 
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)     Connection-oriented transport layer protocol 
that provides reliable full-duplex data transmission. TCP is part of the TCP/IP protocol 
stack.

Transport layer     This layer is responsible for reliable network communication 
between end nodes. The transport layer provides mechanisms for the establishment, 
maintenance, and termination of virtual circuits, transport fault detection and recovery, 
and information flow control. 
UDP (User Datagram Protocol)     Connectionless transport layer protocol in the 
TCP/IP protocol stack. UDP is a simple protocol that exchanges datagrams without 
acknowledgments or guaranteed delivery, requiring that error processing and 
retransmission be handled by other protocols. UDP is defined in RFC 768. 
Window size     Refers to the number of messages that can be transmitted while 
awaiting an acknowledgment. 
 
Focus Questions 
1. 
What type of numbers are used to keep track of different conversations 
that cross the network at the same time? 
Both TCP and UDP use port numbers to pass information to the upper layers. 
Port numbers are used to keep track of different conversations that cross the 
network at the same time. 
2. 
What is the name of a protocol that combines connectionless and 
connection-oriented service? 
The Internet Protocol (IP) includes both TCP (connection-oriented) and UDP 
(connectionless) protocols. 
3. 
What is the difference between TCP and UDP? 
User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is the connectionless transport protocol in the 
TCP/IP protocol stack. UDP is a simple protocol that exchanges datagrams, 
without acknowledgments or guaranteed delivery. Error processing and 
retransmission must be handled by other protocols. 
TCP hosts establish a connection-oriented session with one another using a 
three-way handshake. 
A three-way handshake/open connection sequence synchronizes a connection at 
both ends before data is transferred. This exchange of introductory sequence 
numbers during the connection sequence is important because it ensures that 
any data that is lost due to transmission problems can be recovered. 
4. 
What is the field in a TCP segment that ensures correct sequencing of the 
arriving data? 
TCP provides sequencing of bytes with a forward reference acknowledgment. 
The sequence number in the TCP header is associated with the first byte in the 
user data area. At the receiving station, TCP reassembles the segments into a 
complete message.

Layer 5: The Session Layer 
Introduction 
The session layer, which is Layer 5 of the OSI reference model, establishes, manages, 
and terminates sessions between applications. Essentially, the session layer 
coordinates service requests and responses that occur when applications communicate 
between different hosts. 
 
Concept Questions 
Demonstrate your knowledge of these concepts by answering the following question in 
the space provided. 
• 
Session layer functions coordinate communication interactions between applications. Give 
an example of how these communication interactions are coordinated. 
Communication sessions consist of service requests and service responses that 
occur between applications located in different network devices. These requests 
and responses are coordinated by protocols implemented at the session layer. 
Some examples of session layer implementations include Zone Information 
Protocol (ZIP); the AppleTalk protocol, which coordinates the name-binding 
process; and Session Control Protocol (SCP), the DECnet Phase IV session 
layer protocol.

5. 
What type of two-way communication is the session layer most involved 
in? 
If two-way simultaneous communication is allowed, the session layer does little 
in the way of managing the conversation, and allows the other layers of the 
communicating computers to manage the conversation.  
Two way-alternate communication involves the use of a session layer data 
token, which allows each host to take turns. This is similar to the way a Layer 2 
Token Ring handles Layer 1 collisions. 
6. 
What is the responsibility of the session layer? 
The session layer establishes, manages, and terminates sessions between 
applications.  
7. 
When computers communicate with each other, what is the dialog process 
called that determines which computer takes on the role of the client and 
which takes on the role of the server? 
Communication between two computers involves many mini-conversations, thus 
ensuring that the two computers can communicate effectively. One requirement 
of these mini-conversations is that each host plays dual roles: requesting 
service, like a client; and, replying with service, like a server. Determining which 
role they are playing at any given moment is called dialog control.

Layer 6: The Presentation Layer 
Introduction 
Layer 6 of the OSI reference model, the presentation layer, provides code formatting 
and conversion. Code formatting is used to make sure that applications have meaningful 
information to process. If necessary, this layer can translate between different data 
formats. 
The presentation layer is not only concerned with the format and representation of data. 
It also is concerned with the data structure that the programs used. Thus, Layer 6 
arranges for Layer 7 how data will be organized when it is transferred. 
 
Concept Questions 
Demonstrate your knowledge of these concepts by answering the following questions in 
the space provided. 
• 
Layer 6 standards also guide how graphic images are presented. What standards for 
graphic images do Layer 6 employ? 
PICT—A picture format used to transfer QuickDraw graphics between programs 
on the MAC operating system 
Tagged Image File Format (TIFF)—A format for high-resolution, bitmapped 
images 
Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG)—A graphics format used most often to 
compress still images of complex pictures and photographs 
Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI)—–Standard for digitized music 
Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG)—Standard for the compression and 
coding of motion video for CDs and digital storage 
QuickTime—Standard that handles audio and video for programs on both MAC 
and PC operating systems 
• 
Explain how Layer 6 structures the data for Layer 7 to transfer. 
After receiving data from the application layer, the presentation layer performs 
one or all of its functions on the data before it sends it to the session layer. At the 
receiving station, the presentation layer takes the data from the session layer 
and performs the required functions before passing it to the application layer.

ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)      American Standard 
Code for Information Interchange. An 8-bit code for character representation (7 bits plus 
parity). 
Compression     The running of a data set through an algorithm that reduces the space 
required to store or the bandwidth required to transmit the data set. 
EBCDIC (Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code)      Extended binary 
coded decimal interchange code. Any of a number of coded character sets developed 
by IBM consisting of 8-bit coded characters. This character code is used by older IBM 
systems and telex machines. 
Encryption     The application of a specific algorithm to data so as to alter the 
appearance of the data making it incomprehensible to those who are not authorized to 
see the information. 
Presentation layer     This layer ensures that information sent by the application layer 
of one system will be readable by the application layer of another. The presentation 
layer also is concerned with the data structures used by programs and therefore 
negotiates data transfer syntax for the application layer.

1. 
What are the three functions of the presentation layer? 
Data formatting (presentation) 
Data encryption 
Data compression 
2. 
At the receiving station, from which layer does the presentation layer get 
the data? 
The presentation layer takes the data from the session layer and performs the 
required functions before passing it to the application layer. 
3.

Programs such as FTP use the binary file type to transfer files. Networks use 
many different types of files. 
7. 
What are the two file formats used by the Internet to display images? 
The Internet uses two binary file formats to display images: GIF and JPEG. Any 
computer with a reader for the GIF and JPEG file formats can read these file 
types, regardless of the type of computer. 
8. 
What type of file format is used as a set of directions for displaying a page 
on a web browser? 
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), the language of the Internet, tells a 
browser whether to display text or to provide a hyperlink to another URL. HTML 
is not a programming language, but it is a set of directions for displaying a page.

Layer 7: The Application Layer 
Introduction 
In the context of the OSI reference model, the application layer, Layer 7 of the OSI 
reference model, supports the communicating component of an application. 
A computer application can require only information that resides on its computer. 
However, a network application might have a communicating component from one or 
more network applications.  
A word processor might incorporate a file-transfer component that allows a document to 
be transferred electronically over a network. This file-transfer component qualifies the 
word processor as an application in the OSI context and belongs in Layer 7 of the OSI 
reference model. 
Web browsers, such as Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer, also have data-
transfer components. An example of this is when you go to a web site—the web pages 
are transferred to your computer. 
 
Concept Questions  
Demonstrate your knowledge of these concepts by answering the following questions in 
the space provided. 
• 
The application layer (Layer 7) provides services to application processes that 
are outside of the OSI model. What services are provided?  
⇒ 
Provides services to application processes that are outside of the OSI 
model  
⇒ 
Identifies and establishes the availability of intended communication 
partners  
⇒ 
Synchronizes cooperating applications 
⇒ 
 Establishes agreement on procedures for error recovery and control of 
data integrity. 
• 
The application layer identifies and establishes the availability of intended 
communication partners and the resources required to connect with them. What 
are these resources? 
The application layer is the OSI layer closest to the end user. This determines 
whether sufficient resources exist for communication between systems (such as 
electronic mail, file transfer, and terminal emulation). The application layer 
provides a direct interface to the rest of the OSI model for network applications 
(such as browser, e-mail, FTP, and Telnet) or an indirect interface for standalone 
applications (such as word processors, spreadsheets, and presentation 
managers) with a network redirector.

Define the following terms as completely as you can. Use the online Chapter 15 of the 
Cisco Systems Networking Academy: First-Year Companion Guide, Second Edition, 
material for help. 
Application layer     Layer 7 of the OSI reference model. This layer provides services to 
application processes (such as electronic mail, file transfer, and terminal emulation) that 
are outside of the OSI model. The application layer identifies and establishes the 
availability of intended communication partners (and the resources required to connect 
with them), synchronizes cooperating applications, and establishes agreement on 
procedures for error recovery and control of data integrity. Corresponds roughly with the 
transaction services layer in the SNA model. 
Client      Node or software program (front-end device) that requests services from a 
server. 
Client/server computing     Term used to describe distributed computing (processing) 
network systems in which transaction responsibilities are divided into two parts: client 
(front end) and server (back end). Both terms (client and server) can be applied to 
software programs or actual computing devices. Also called distributed computing 
(processing).  
DNS (Domain Name System)     System used in the Internet for translating names of 
network nodes into addresses.  
Domain server     Server that exists on a local-area network responsible for sharing 
services and authenticating network access. 
FTP (File Transfer Protocol)     Application protocol, part of the TCP/IP protocol stack, 
used for transferring files between network nodes.  
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)     Simple hypertext document formatting 
language that uses tags to indicate how a given part of a document should be 
interpreted by a viewing application, such as a WWW browser.  
Hypertext     Electronically stored text that allows direct access to other texts by way of 
encoded links. Hypertext documents can be created using HTML and often integrate 
images, sound, and other media that are commonly viewed using a WWW browser.  
IP address     1) A 32-bit address assigned to hosts using TCP/IP. An IP address 
belongs to one of five classes (A, B, C, D, or E) and is written as 4 octets separated with 
periods (dotted-decimal format). Each address consists of a network number, an 
optional subnetwork number, and a host number. The network and subnetwork numbers 
together are used for routing; whereas, the host number is used to address an individual 
host within the network or subnetwork. A subnet mask is used to extract network and 
subnetwork information from the IP address. Also called an Internet address. 2) 
Command used to establish the logical network address of this interface.  
Redirector     Software that intercepts requests for resources within a computer and 
analyzes them for remote access requirements. If remote access is required to satisfy 
the request, the redirector forms an RPC and sends the RPC to lower-layer protocol 
software for transmission through the network to the node that can satisfy the request.  

 
125 - 239  Engineering Journal and Workbook, Vol. I, 2nd Ed. – Chapter 15  Copyright © 2002 Cisco Systems, Inc. 
Server     Node or software program that provides services to clients.  
Telnet     Command used to verify the application layer software between source and 
destination stations. This is the most complete test mechanism available. 
URL (Universal Resource Locator)     Standardized addressing scheme for accessing 
hypertext documents and other services using a WWW browser.  
 
Focus Questions 
1. 
To which other OSI layers does the application layer provide service? 
The application layer does not provide services to any other OSI layer. 
2. 
What is a network application that uses the direct interface provided by the 
application layer? 
A word processor might incorporate a file-transfer component that allows a 
document to be transferred electronically over the network. 
3. 
What is a network application that uses the indirect interface provided by 
the application layer? 
The application layer provides a direct interface for the rest of the OSI model, by 
using network applications (for instance, WWW, e-mail, FTP, Telnet), or an 
indirect interface, by using standalone applications (for instance, word 
processors, spreadsheets, presentation managers, network redirector). 
4. 
Where is the server side of a client/server application located? 
These applications (such as FTP, web browsers, and e-mail) all have two 
components that allow them to function: the client side and the server side. The 
client side is located on the local computer and is the requestor of the services. 
The server side is located on a remote computer and provides services in 
response to the client’s requests. 
5. 
What is the looped routine constantly repeated by a client/server 
application? 
A client/server application works by constantly repeating the following looped 
routine: client-request, server-response; client-request, server-response; and so 
on. 
6. 
What does DNS do? 
Domain name system (DNS) is a device on a network that manages domain 
names and responds to requests from clients to translate a domain name into 
the associated IP address. 
7. 
Which protocol do file utility programs use to copy and move files between 
remote sites? 
File utility programs use the FTP protocol for copying and moving files between 
remote sites.

WANs and Routers 
Introduction 
One major characteristic of a wide-area network (WAN) is that the network operates 
beyond the local LAN’s geographic scope. It uses the services of carriers, such as 
Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs), Sprint, and MCI. 
WANs use serial connections of various types to access bandwidth over wide-area 
geographies. By definition, the WAN connects devices separated by wide areas. WAN 
devices include the following: 
• 
Routers, which offer many services, including internetworking and WAN interface 
ports 
• 
Switches, which connect to WAN bandwidth for voice, data, and video 
communication 
• 
Modems, which interface voice-grade services and channel service units/digital 
service units 
• 
CSU/DSUs that interface T1/E1 services and Terminal Adapters/Network 
Termination 1 
• 
TA/NT1s that interface Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) services 
• 
Communication servers, which concentrate on dial-in and dial-out user 
communication 
 
Concept Questions 
Demonstrate your knowledge of these concepts by answering the following questions in 
the space provided. 
• 
A WAN is used to interconnect local-area networks (LANs) that are typically 
separated by a large geographic area. A WAN operates at the OSI reference 
model physical and data link layers. The WAN provides for the exchange of data 
packets/frames between routers/bridges and the LANs that they support. Draw a 
WAN that includes three LANs. 
Student should sketch a WAN with three connected LAN segments. Students 
should use the appropriate symbols to represent all network devices. 

 
129 - 239  Engineering Journal and Workbook, Vol. I, 2nd Ed. – Chapter 16  Copyright © 2002 Cisco Systems, Inc. 
• 
Compare and contrast WANs and LANs layer by layer. 
LANs use deterministic and nondeterministic communication to allow access to 
the media. The transport of data typically is seen by numerous nodes on a 
segment. Layer 1 communication runs across UTP, STP, fiber, and coax lines. 
Connectors used include, but are not limited to, RJ-45, ST, SC, FC, AUI, and 
BNC connectors. Communication is typically much faster than that of wide-area 
links. LANs use 802.2, 802.3, 802.4, or 802.5 Layer 2 frame encapsulation.  
WANs operate beyond the local LAN’s geographic scope. They use the services 
of carriers such as Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs) and Sprint and 
MCI. They use serial connections of various types to access network bandwidth. 
Layer 1 connections are generally V.35, RS232, RS449, and RJ-48 connectors. 
Communication is generally across a point-to-point, circuit, or packet-switched 
environment. WANs use layer 2 encapsulations such as Frame Relay, HDLC, 
SDLC, PPP, and X.25. 
 
Vocabulary Exercise Chapter 16 
Define the following terms as completely as you can. Use the online Chapter 16 of the 
Cisco Systems Networking Academy: First-Year Companion Guide, Second Edition, 
material for help. 
CSU (channel service unit)     Digital interface device that connects end-user 
equipment to the local digital telephone loop. Often referred to together with DSU, as 
CSU/DSU. See also DSU.  
DCE (Data Communications Equipment (EIA expansion) or data circuit-
terminating equipment (ITU-T expansion))     The devices and connections of a 
communications network that comprise the network end of the user-to-network 
interface. The DCE provides a physical connection to the network, forwards traffic, and 
provides a clocking signal used to synchronize data transmission between DCE and 
DTE devices. Modems and interface cards are examples of DCE. Compare with DTE.  
DSU (data service unit)     Device used in digital transmission that adapts the physical 
interface on a DTE device to a transmission facility such as T1 or E1. The DSU also is 
responsible for such functions as signal timing. Often referred to together with CSU, as 
CSU/DSU. See also CSU.  
DTE (data terminal equipment)     Device at the user end of a user-network interface 
that serves as a data source, destination, or both. DTE connects to a data network 
through a DCE device (for example, a modem) and typically uses clocking signals 
generated by the DCE. DTE includes such devices as computers, protocol translators, 
and multiplexers. Compare with DCE.  
E1     Wide-area digital transmission scheme used predominantly in Europe that carries 
data at a rate of 2.048 Mbps. E1 lines can be leased for private use from common 
carriers. Compare with T1.  
Frame Relay     Industry-standard, switched data link layer protocol that handles 
multiple virtual circuits using HDLC encapsulation between connected devices. Frame 
Relay is more efficient than X.25, the protocol for which it is generally considered a 
replacement.  

 
130 - 239  Engineering Journal and Workbook, Vol. I, 2nd Ed. – Chapter 16  Copyright © 2002 Cisco Systems, Inc. 
HDLC (High-Level Data Link Control)     Bit-oriented synchronous data link layer 
protocol developed by ISO. Derived from SDLC, HDLC specifies a data encapsulation 
method on synchronous serial links using frame characters and checksums.  
ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network)     Communication protocol, offered by 
telephone companies, that permits telephone networks to carry data, voice, and other 
source traffic.  
PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol)     A successor to SLIP, PPP provides router-to-router 
and host-to-network connections over synchronous and asynchronous circuits.  
PTT (Post, Telephone, and Telegraph)     Government agency that provides telephone 
services. PTTs exist in most areas outside North America and provide both local and 
long-distance telephone services.  
RBOC (Regional Bell Operating Company)     Local or regional telephone company 
that owns and operates telephone lines and switches in one of seven U.S. regions. The 
RBOCs were created by the divestiture of AT&T. Also called Bell Operating Company 
(BOC). 
T1     Digital WAN carrier facility. T1 transmits DS-1-formatted data at 1.544 Mbps 
through the telephone-switching network, using AMI or B8ZS coding. Compare with E1.   
 
Focus Questions 
1. 
Name and briefly describe four WAN devices.  
WAN devices include routers (which offer internetworking and WAN interface 
ports); switches (for sharing bandwidth); modems, CSU/DSUs, and terminal 
adapters (which allow a variety of data connection services); and communication 
servers (which concentrate dial-in and dial-out user communications). 
2. 
Name two ways in which WANs differ from LANs. 
WANs operate over a large geographical area (LANs do not); WANs emphasize 
access over serial interfaces operating at lower speeds to ensure reliability. 
(LANs can operate reliably at very high speeds with multiple access.) 
3. 
What do the acronyms DTE and DCE stand for?  
DTE stands for data terminal equipment, which refers to the end of the user’s 
devices on a WAN link. DCE stands for data circuit-terminating equipment, which 
refers to the end of the WAN provider’s side of the communication facility.

Router CLI  
Introduction 
You configure Cisco routers from the user interface that runs on the router console or 
terminal. You also can configure Cisco routers by using remote access. You must log in 
to the router before you can enter an EXEC command. 
For security purposes, the router has two levels of access to commands: 
• 
User mode—Typical tasks include those that check the router status. In this 
mode, router configuration changes are not allowed.  
• 
Privileged mode—Typical tasks include those that change the router 
configuration. 
 
Concept Questions 
Demonstrate your knowledge of these concepts by answering the following questions in 
the space provided. 
• 
You can use the router to do the following: 
⇒ 
Log in with the user password. 
⇒ 
Enter privileged mode with the enable password. 
⇒ 
Disable or quit. 
What procedures would you follow to log in to the router? 
When you first log in to a router, you see a user-mode prompt: 
Router>    
At the > prompt, type enable 
At the password prompt, enter the password that has been set with the enable 
secret command. 
When you have completed the login steps, the prompt changes to a pound sign 
(#) because you are now in privileged mode. From privileged mode, you can 
access modes such as global configuration mode and other specific 
configuration modes.

Router con0 is now available. 
Press RETURN to get started. 
User Access Verification 
Password: 
Router> 
Router> enable 
Password: 
Router# 
Router# disable 
• 
You can use the following advanced help features: 
Command completion and prompting  
Syntax checking 
Why would you need to use syntax checking? 
You can use the following advanced editing features: 
⇒ 
Automatic line scrolling  
⇒ 
Cursor controls  
⇒ 
History buffer with command recall  
⇒ 
Copy and paste, which are available on most laptop computers 
• 
Why is it important to have two different levels of access of commands? 
Commands available at user level are a subset of the commands available at the 
privileged level. For the most part, these commands enable you to display 
information without changing router configuration settings. You may want to have 
multiple administrators with varied levels of access. To access the full set of 
commands, you must first enable privileged mode. 
 
Vocabulary Exercise Chapter 17 
Define the following terms as completely as you can. Use the online Chapter 17 of the 
Cisco Systems Networking Academy: First-Year Companion Guide, Second Edition, 
material for help. 
Privileged mode    Typical tasks include those that change the router configuration. 
User mode    Typical tasks include those that check the router status. In this mode, 
router configuration changes are not allowed.

Focus Questions 
1. 
How do you use a router?  
To configure Cisco routers, you must either access the user interface on the 
router with a terminal or access the router remotely. When accessing a router, 
you must log in to the router before you enter any other commands. 
2. 
Distinguish between user mode and privileged mode. 
User mode enables you to check router status; privileged mode enables you to 
actually change the router’s configuration. 
3. 
In Cisco IOS, what is the user mode prompt and what is the privileged 
mode prompt? 
The > is the user-mode prompt; the # is the privileged-mode prompt. 
4. 
What must you type at the user or privileged mode prompts to display a list 
of commonly used commands? 
You must type a ? to display the list of commonly used commands. 
5. 
When in user mode, what must you do to enter privileged mode? 
You must type ena (short for enable) and then a password. 
6. 
If you are unsure of the syntax or arguments for a command, what feature 
can be of great help to you? 
If you guess at the command syntax and arguments, the Cisco IOS context-
sensitive help will highlight your errors and suggest corrections. Additionally, by 
adding a space and then the question mark after a partial command, you will get 
hints about how to proceed.

Chapter 18 
Router Components 
Introduction 
Whether accessed from the console or by a Telnet session through an auxiliary port, the 
router can be placed in several modes. Each mode provides different functions: 
• 
User EXEC mode—A “look-only” mode in which the user can view some 
information about the router, but cannot change anything. 
• 
Privileged EXEC mode—Supports the debugging and testing commands, 
detailed examination of the router, manipulation of configuration files, and 
access to configuration modes.  
• 
Setup mode—Presents an interactive prompted dialog box at the console that 
helps the new user create a first-time, basic configuration.  
• 
Global configuration mode—Implements powerful one-line commands that 
perform simple configuration tasks.  
• 
Other configuration modes—Provide more complicated multiple-line 
configurations.  
• 
RXBOOT mode—A maintenance mode that can be used, among other things, 
to recover lost passwords. 
 
Concept Questions 
Demonstrate your knowledge of these concepts by answering the following questions in 
the space provided. 
• 
The router is made up of configurable components. How are these 
components configured? 
You can configure a router from many external locations, including the following: 
⇒ 
From the console terminal (a computer connected to the router through a 
console port) during its installation 
⇒ 
Via modem by using the auxiliary port 
⇒ 
From virtual terminals, after the router has been installed on the network 
⇒ 
From a TFTP server on the network 

 
145 - 239  Engineering Journal and Workbook, Vol. I, 2nd Ed. – Chapter 18  Copyright © 2002 Cisco Systems, Inc. 
• 
The router has modes for examining, maintaining, and changing the 
components. In the examining mode, what does the router do? 
User EXEC allows for the execution of basic commands that you can issue to 
determine the current status of a router. These commands help you obtain vital 
information that you need when monitoring and troubleshooting router 
operations. 
• 
The show commands are used for examination. What does the show 
command examine? 
It is important to be able to monitor the health and state of your router at any 
given time. These commands are as follows: 
• 
show version  
• 
show processes 
• 
show protocols 
• 
show memory 
• 
show stacks 
• 
show buffers 
• 
show flash 
• 
show running-config 
• 
show startup-config 
• 
show interface 
Among the most used Cisco IOS software EXEC commands are show running-
config and show startup-config. These commands enable an administrator 
to see the current running configuration on the router or the startup configuration 
commands that the router will use on the next restart. 
• 
Use CDP to show entries about neighbors. 
• 
Access other routers with Telnet. 
• 
Test network connectivity layer by layer. Testing commands include ping, 
trace, and debug. What is the difference between trace and ping? 
The ping command sends a packet to the destination host and then waits for a 
reply packet from that host. You can use the ping user EXEC command to 
diagnose basic network connectivity. 
The trace command is the ideal tool for finding where data is being sent in your 
network. The trace command is similar to the ping command, except that, 
instead of testing end-to-end connectivity, trace tests each step along the way. 
This operation can be performed at either the user or the privileged EXEC levels.

Vocabulary Exercise Chapter 18 
Define the following terms as completely as you can. Use the online Chapter 18 or the 
Cisco Systems Networking Academy: First-Year Companion Guide, Second Edition, 
material for help. 
CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol)     Media- and protocol-independent device-discovery 
protocol that runs on all Cisco-manufactured equipment including routers, access 
servers, bridges, and switches. Using CDP, a device can advertise its existence to other 
devices and receive information about other devices on the same LAN or on the remote 
side of a WAN. Runs on all media that support SNAP, including LANs, Frame Relay, 
and ATM media. 
CPU (central processing unit)     The part of a computer that controls all the other 
parts. It fetches instructions from memory and decodes them. This may cause it to 
transfer data to or from memory or to activate peripherals to perform input or output. 
DRAM (dynamic random-access memory)     RAM that stores information in 
capacitors that must be periodically refreshed. Delays can occur because DRAMs are 
inaccessible to the processor when refreshing their contents. However, DRAMs are less 
complex and have greater capacity than SRAMs. 
Interface     1) Connection between two systems or devices. 2) In routing terminology, a 
network connection. 3) In telephony, a shared boundary defined by common physical 
interconnection characteristics, signal characteristics, and meanings of interchanged 
signals. 4) The boundary between adjacent layers of the OSI model. 
NVRAM (nonvolatile RAM)     RAM that retains its contents when a unit is powered off. 
In Cisco products, NVRAM is used to store configuration information. 
ping     Command that uses the ICMP protocol to verify the hardware connection and 
the logical address of the network layer. This is a very basic testing mechanism. 
RAM (random-access memory)     Volatile memory that can be read and written by a 
microprocessor. 
Telnet      Command used to verify the application layer software between source and 
destination stations. This is the most complete test mechanism available. 
TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)     Simplified version of FTP that allows files to be 
transferred from one computer to another over a network. 
trace     Command that uses Time-To-Live (TTL) values to generate messages from 
each router used along the path. This is very powerful in its capability to locate failures 
in the path from the source to the destination.

Refer to diagrams in the Companion Guide. 
2. 
List three external configuration sources for Cisco routers.  
Routers may be configured from the console terminal through the console port, 
via a modem using the auxiliary port, and from virtual terminals or a TFTP server 
once it is on a network. 
3. 
List and describe the internally configurable components of a router.  
Internal configuration components include RAM (stores routing tables, ARP 
cache, and running configuration file), NVRAM (stores the router’s backup 
configuration file; retains content even when powered down), Flash (erasable, 
reprogrammable ROM, holds the operating system image), ROM(contains 
power-on diagnostics, a bootstrap program, and operating system software) and 
interfaces (network connections through which packets enter and exit the router). 
4. 
List at least seven commands that can show router status and the 
configurable components about which they display information. 
Commands for examining a router’s status include the following:  
show version (RAM IOS) 
show processes cpu and show processes (RAM programs)  
show running-config (RAM active configuration file) 
show mem, show stacks, show buffers (RAM tables and buffers) 
show startup-config   
show config (NVRAM), show flash (Flash) 
show interfaces (Interfaces)  
5. 
Briefly describe what Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) show cdp neighbors 
can tell you about a network.  
The command show cdp neighbors works at the data link layer to display the 
following information: neighbor device ID, local port type and number, 
decremental holdtime value in seconds, the neighbor’s device capability code, 
the hardware platform of the neighbor, and the neighbor’s remote port type and 
number.

6. 
Using the OSI model and the commands telnet, ping, trace, show ip 
route, and show interface, describe the basic testing of a network. 
The basic testing of a network should proceed from Layer 7 (using telnet to 
access various routers), to Layer 3 (using ping, trace, and show ip route 
to learn logical address information about the network), and then to Layers 3, 2, 
and 1 (using show interface to learn about specific port configurations and 
whether specific links are alive), and then on to Layer 1 (specific medium tests).

Router Startup and Setup 
Introduction 
The startup routines for Cisco IOS software have the goal of starting router operations. 
The router must deliver reliable performance connecting the user networks it was 
configured to serve. To do this, the startup routines must do the following: 
• 
Make sure that the router comes up with all its hardware tested.  
• 
Find from memory and load the Cisco IOS software that the router uses for its 
operating system. 
• 
Find from memory and apply the configuration statements about the router, 
including protocol functions and interface addresses.  
The router makes sure that it comes up with tested hardware. When a Cisco router 
powers up, it performs a power-on self-test (POST). During this self-test, the router 
executes diagnostics from ROM on all modules. These diagnostics verify the basic 
operation of the CPU, memory, and network interface ports. After it verifies the 
hardware functions, the router proceeds with software initialization. 
 
Concept Questions 
Demonstrate your knowledge of these concepts by answering the following questions in 
the space provided. 
• 
The router initializes by loading a bootstrap, the operating system, and a 
configuration file. What does each of these items do?  
A bootstrap is a simple, preset operation to load instructions that, in turn, cause 
other instructions to be loaded into memory or that affect entry into other 
configuration modes. 
The operating system (Cisco IOS) can be found in one of several places. The 
location is disclosed in the boot field of the configuration register. If the boot field 
indicates a Flash, or network load, boot system commands in the configuration 
file indicate the exact location of the image. 
The configuration file saved in NVRAM is loaded into main memory and is 
executed one line at a time. These configuration commands start routing 
processes, supply addresses for interfaces, set media characteristics, and so on. 

 
158 - 239  Engineering Journal and Workbook, Vol. I, 2nd Ed. – Chapter 19  Copyright © 2002 Cisco Systems, Inc. 
• 
If the router cannot find a configuration file, the router enters setup mode. What 
does the setup mode do? 
If no valid configuration file exists in NVRAM, the operating system executes a 
question-driven initial configuration routine referred to as the system 
configuration dialog, or setup dialog. 
Setup is not intended as the mode for configuring complex protocol features in 
the router. You should use setup to bring up a minimal configuration, and then 
use various configuration-mode commands rather than setup for most router 
configuration tasks. 
• 
The router stores a backup copy of the new configuration from setup mode. 
Where does the router store this backup copy? 
The router stores in NVRAM a backup copy of the current configuration. 
• 
Prepare a flowchart of the startup (boot) sequence of a multimedia PC. 
Refer to Figure 19-1 in the Companion Guide. 
 
Vocabulary Exercise Chapter 19 
Define the following terms as completely as you can. Use the online Chapter 19 or the 
Cisco Systems Networking Academy: First-Year Companion Guide, Second Edition, 
material for help. 
CPU (central processing unit)     The part of a computer that controls all the other 
parts. It fetches instructions from memory and decodes them. This may cause it to 
transfer data to or from memory or to activate peripherals to perform input or output. 
erase startup-config     Command used to delete the backup configuration file in 
NVRAM. 
Reload     The event of a Cisco router rebooting, or the command that causes the 
router to reboot. 
 
Focus Questions 
1. 
What are the three main things the router accomplishes upon startup?  
⇒ 
Makes sure that the router comes up with all its hardware tested. 
⇒ 
Finds and loads the Cisco IOS software that the router uses for its 
operating system. 
⇒ 
Finds the startup-config file and applies the configuration statements, 
including protocol functions and interface addresses. 

 
159 - 239  Engineering Journal and Workbook, Vol. I, 2nd Ed. – Chapter 19  Copyright © 2002 Cisco Systems, Inc. 
2. 
Briefly describe the router startup sequence.  
Step 1. The generic bootstrap loader executes on the CPU card.  
Step 2. The location of the IOS image is found by searching the configuration 
registers. If the boot field indicates a Flash, or network load, boot system 
commands in the configuration file indicate the exact location of the 
image. 
Step 3. The operating system image is loaded. Once operational, the OS locates 
the hardware and software components and lists the results on the 
console terminal. 
Step 4. The configuration file saved in NVRAM is loaded into main memory and is 
executed one line at a time. These configuration commands start routing 
processes, supply addresses for interfaces, set media characteristics, 
and so on. 
Step 5. If no valid configuration file exists in NVRAM, the operating system 
executes a question-driven initial configuration routine referred to as the 
system configuration dialog, or setup dialog. 
3. 
What is the main purpose of setup mode?  
The main purpose of setup mode is to quickly bring up a minimal configuration 
for any router that cannot find its configuration from some other source. 
4. 
During the system configuration dialog, you are prompted to set up “global 
parameters” and to set up “interfaces.” Explain.  
Global parameters are used to configure hostnames, enable passwords, enable 
secret passwords, and global configuration values. When prompted to set up 
“interfaces,” you need to use the configuration values that you have determined 
for each interface. These values include IP address, subnet mask, network 
protocol, and so on. 
5. 
After you have completed the setup command program and your 
configuration displays, you are asked whether you want to use this 
configuration. If you answer “yes,” what happens?  
If you answer “yes,” the configuration is executed and saved to NVRAM. Your 
system is now ready to use.

Router Configuration 1 
Introduction 
The router uses information from the configuration file when it starts up. The 
configuration file contains commands to customize router operation. As you saw in the 
previous chapter, if no configuration file is available, the system configuration dialog 
setup guides you through creating one. 
 
Concept Questions 
Demonstrate your knowledge of these concepts by answering the following questions in 
the space provided. 
Configuration files can come from the console, NVRAM, or a TFTP server. The router 
has several modes: 
• 
Privileged mode is used for copying and managing entire configuration files.  
• 
Global configuration mode is used for one-line commands and commands that 
change the entire router.  
• 
Other configuration modes are used for multiple command lines and detailed 
configurations.  
The router provides a hostname, a banner, and interface descriptions to aid in 
identification. 
• 
What does it mean to configure a router?  
Router configuration information can be generated by several means. You can 
use the privileged EXEC configure command to configure from a virtual 
(remote) terminal, a modem connection, or a console terminal. This enables you 
to enter changes to an existing configuration at any time. 
You can also use the privileged EXEC configure command to load a 
configuration from a network TFTP server, which enables you to maintain and 
store configuration information at a central site. 
• 
Why must routers be configured? 
A router must know which interfaces are to be used, which routed and routing 
protocols are supported, along with security and access list configurations.

Chapter 21 
IOS Images 
Introduction 
The default source for Cisco IOS software depends on the hardware platform; but most 
commonly, the router looks to the configuration commands saved in NVRAM. Cisco IOS 
software offers several alternatives. You can specify other sources where the router 
should look for software, or the router uses its own fallback sequence as necessary to 
load software. 
Settings in the configuration register enable alternatives for where the router will 
bootstrap Cisco IOS software. You can specify enabled configuration-mode boot system 
commands to enter fallback sources for the router to use in sequence. Save these 
statements in NVRAM to use during the next startup with the command copy 
running-config startup-config. The router uses these commands as needed, in 
sequence, when it restarts. If NVRAM lacks boot system commands the router can use, 
however, the system has its own fallback alternatives. The router falls back and uses 
default Cisco IOS in Flash memory. If Flash memory is empty, the router tries its next 
TFTP alternative. The router uses the configuration register value to form a filename 
from which to boot a default system image stored on a network server. 
 
Concept Questions 
Demonstrate your knowledge of these concepts by answering the following questions in 
the space provided. 
Routers boot Cisco IOS software from 
⇒ 
Flash  
⇒ 
TFTP server  
⇒ 
ROM (not full Cisco IOS)  
⇒ 
Multiple source options provide flexibility and fallback alternatives 
• 
Why does the router need an operating system?  
The OS is a vital and necessary piece of the routing process. It creates the 
framework for which the entire routing process is based on. Different versions of 
software are necessary (based on the needed technologies and improvements 
made to the software). 
• 
Why might there be different versions of router operating systems? 
Cisco products have expanded beyond the generic router to include many 
platforms at many points within the networking product spectrum. To optimize 
how Cisco IOS software operates on these various platforms, Cisco is working to 
develop many different Cisco IOS software images. These images 
accommodate the various platforms, available memory resources, and feature 
set needs that customers have for their network devices. 

 
176 - 239  Engineering Journal and Workbook, Vol. I, 2nd Ed. – Chapter 21  Copyright © 2002 Cisco Systems, Inc. 
• 
Explain the process by which the router locates IOS software.  
The default source for Cisco IOS software startup depends on the hardware 
platform, but most commonly, the router looks to the boot system commands 
saved in NVRAM. However, Cisco IOS software does allow you to use several 
alternatives. You can specify other sources for the router to look for software, or 
the router can use its own fallback sequence, as necessary, to load the software.  
• 
Explain the configuration register. 
The order in which the router looks for IOS images to load depends on the boot 
field setting in the configuration register. You can change the default 
configuration register setting with the global configuration command 
configregister. Use a hexadecimal number as the argument for this 
command as in the following example: 
Router# configure terminal 
Router(config)# config-register 0x10F 
• 
Compare and contrast the boot options for obtaining IOS: from Flash 
memory, from the network, and from ROM. 
⇒ 
Set the configuration register value to 0x100 if you need to enter the 
ROM monitor (primarily a programmer’s environment). From the ROM 
monitor, boot the operating system manually by using the b command at 
the ROM monitor prompt. (This sets the boot field bits to 0-0-0-0.) 
⇒ 
Set the configuration register to 0x101 to configure the system to boot 
automatically from ROM. (This sets the boot field bits to 0-0-0-1.) 
⇒ 
Set the configuration register to any value from 0x102 to 0x10F to 
configure the system to use the boot system commands in NVRAM. This 
is the default. (This sets the boot field bits to between 0-0-1-0 and 1-1-1-
1.) 
• 
Describe the show version command and all the information it tells you. 
The show version command displays information about the Cisco IOS 
software version that is currently running on the router. This includes the 
configuration register and the boot field setting. In the example illustrated in 
Listing 21-1, the Cisco IOS version and descriptive information is highlighted on 
the second output line. The screen captured shows an experimental version of 
Release 11.2. This line shows the system image name: 
System image file is "c4500-f-mz", booted via tftp from 
171.69.1.129    
In addition, the show version command displays information about the type of 
platform on which the version of Cisco IOS software is currently running.

• 
Describe the processes for creating a software image backup, upgrading 
the image from a network, and loading a software image backup. 
⇒ 
Creating a software image backup:  
You should copy a system image back to a network server. This copy of the 
system image can serve as a backup copy. Figure 21-2 and Listing 21-2 use the 
show flash command to learn the name of the system image file (xk09140z), 
and the copy flash tftp command to copy the system image to a TFTP 
server. The files can be renamed during transfer. 
⇒ 
The copy tftp flash command: 
After you have a backup copy of the current Cisco IOS software image, you can 
load a new image. You download the new image from the TFTP server by using 
the command copy tftp flash. Figure 21-3 and Listing 21-3 show that this 
command begins by requesting the IP address of the remote host that will act as 
the TFTP server. Next, the prompt asks for the filename of the new IOS image. 
You need to enter the correct filename of the update image (as it is named on 
the TFTP server). 
⇒ 
How to load a software image backup: 
If you need to load the backup Cisco IOS version, again use the copy command 
copy tftp flash, which will enable you to download the image that you 
previously uploaded to the TFTP server. After you enter the copy tftp flash 
command, as shown in Listing 21-4, the system prompts you for the IP address 
(or name) of the TFTP server. This can be another router serving ROM or Flash 
software images. The system then prompts you for the filename of the software 
image. 
 
Vocabulary Exercise Chapter 21 
Define the following terms as completely as you can. Use the online Chapter 21 or the 
Cisco Systems Networking Academy: First-Year Companion Guide, Second Edition, 
material for help. 
Acknowledgment number     Next expected TCP octet. 
ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)     Internet protocol used to map an IP address to 
a MAC address. Defined in RFC 826. 
Autonomous system     Collection of networks under a common administration sharing 
a common routing strategy. Autonomous systems are subdivided by areas. An 
autonomous system must be assigned a unique 16-bit number by the IANA. Sometimes 
abbreviated AS.  
Bandwidth     The difference between the highest and lowest frequencies available for 
network signals. The term is also used to describe the rated throughput capacity of a 
given network medium or protocol.

identified by a broadcast address. 

 
178 - 239  Engineering Journal and Workbook, Vol. I, 2nd Ed. – Chapter 21  Copyright © 2002 Cisco Systems, Inc. 
Checksum     1) Method for checking the integrity of transmitted data. A checksum is an 
integer value computed from a sequence of octets taken through a series of arithmetic 
operations. The value is recomputed at the receiving end and compared for verification. 
2) Calculated checksum of the header and data fields. 
Configuration register     In Cisco routers, a 16-bit, user-configurable value that 
determines how the router functions during initialization. The configuration register can 
be stored in hardware or software. In hardware, the bit position is set using a jumper. In 
software, the bit position is set by specifying a hexadecimal value using configuration 
commands.  
Delay      The time between the initiation of a transaction by a sender and the first 
response received by the sender. Also, the time required to move a packet from source 
to destination over a given path. 
Destination port     Number of the called port. 
Distance-vector routing algorithm      Class of routing algorithms that iterate on the 
number of hops in a route to find a shortest-path spanning tree. Distance-vector routing 
algorithms call for each router to send its entire routing table in each update, but only to 
its neighbors. Distance-vector routing algorithms can be prone to routing loops, but are 
computationally simpler than link-state routing algorithms. 
DNS (Domain Name System)     System used in the Internet for translating names of 
network nodes into addresses. 
Dynamic routing     Routing that adjusts automatically to network topology or traffic 
changes. 
EEPROM     EPROM that can be erased using electrical signals applied to specific pins. 
Enhanced     IOS image that has additional capabilities and/or protocols usually 
identified by the word Plus or referred to as Feature Pack. 
Flooding     Traffic passing technique used by switches and bridges in which traffic 
received on an interface is sent out all of the interfaces of that device except the 
interface on which the information was originally received.  
Flow control      Technique for ensuring that a transmitting entity, such as a modem, 
does not overwhelm a receiving entity with data. When the buffers on the receiving 
device are full, a message is sent to the sending device to suspend the transmission 
until the data in the buffers has been processed. 
Handshake     Sequence of messages exchanged between two or more network 
devices to ensure transmission synchronization. 
HLEN     Number of 32-bit words in the header. 
Host      Computer system on a network. Similar to the term node except that host 
usually implies a computer system; whereas, node generally applies to any networked 
system, including access servers and routers. 
IGRP (Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)     IGP developed by Cisco to address the 
problems associated with routing in large, heterogeneous networks. 

 
179 - 239  Engineering Journal and Workbook, Vol. I, 2nd Ed. – Chapter 21  Copyright © 2002 Cisco Systems, Inc. 
Link-state routing algorithm     Routing algorithm in which each router broadcasts or 
multicasts information regarding the cost of reaching each of its neighbors to all nodes 
in the internetwork. Link-state algorithms create a consistent view of the network and 
are therefore not prone to routing loops, but they achieve this at the cost of relatively 
greater computational difficulty and more widespread traffic (compared with distance-
vector routing algorithms). 
MTU (maximum transmission unit)     Maximum packet size, in bytes, that a particular 
interface can handle. 
Network     1) Collection of computers, printers, routers, switches, and other devices 
that can communicate with each other over some transmission medium. 2) Command 
that assigns a NIC-based address to which the router is directly connected. 3) 
Command that specifies any directly connected networks to be included. 
OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)     Link-state, hierarchical IGP routing algorithm 
proposed as a successor to RIP in the Internet community. OSPF features include least-
cost routing, multipath routing, and load balancing. 
Ping      Short for Packet Internet Groper or Packet Internetwork Groper, a utility to 
determine whether a specific IP address is accessible. It works by sending a packet to 
the specified address and waiting for a reply. Ping is used primarily to troubleshoot 
Internet connections. 
RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol)     Protocol in the TCP/IP stack that 
provides a method for finding IP addresses based on MAC addresses. 
Reliability     Ratio of expected to received keepalives from a link. If the ratio is high, 
the line is reliable. Used as a routing metric. 
RIP (Routing Information Protocol)     IGP supplied with UNIX BSD systems. The 
most common IGP in the Internet. RIP uses hop count as a routing metric. 
Sequence number     Number used to ensure correct sequencing of the arriving data.  
Source port      Number of the calling port. 
Static route      Route that is explicitly configured and entered into the routing table. 
Static routes take precedence over routes chosen by dynamic routing protocols. 
Subnetwork      1) In IP networks, a network sharing a particular subnet address. 
Subnetworks are networks arbitrarily segmented by a network administrator to provide a 
multilevel, hierarchical routing structure while shielding the subnetwork from the 
addressing complexity of attached networks. Sometimes called a subnet. 2) In OSI 
networks, a collection of ESs and ISs under the control of a single administrative domain 
and using a single network access protocol. 
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)     Connection-oriented transport layer protocol 
that provides reliable full-duplex data transmission. TCP is part of the TCP/IP protocol 
stack. 
Telnet      Command used to verify the application layer software between source and 
destination stations. This is the most complete test mechanism available. 
Trace      Command that uses Time-To-Live (TTL) values to generate messages from 
each router used along the path. This is very powerful in its capability to locate failures 
in the path from the source to the destination. 

 
180 - 239  Engineering Journal and Workbook, Vol. I, 2nd Ed. – Chapter 21  Copyright © 2002 Cisco Systems, Inc. 
UDP (User Datagram Protocol)     Connectionless transport layer protocol in the 
TCP/IP protocol stack. UDP is a simple protocol that exchanges datagrams without 
acknowledgments or guaranteed delivery, requiring that error processing and 
retransmission be handled by other protocols. UDP is defined in RFC 768. 
Window     Number of octets that the receiver is willing to accept. 
Window size      Refers to the number of messages that can be transmitted while 
awaiting an acknowledgment.

Router Configuration 2 
Introduction 
One way to begin understanding the way the Internet works is to configure a router. It is 
also one of the primary topics on the CCNA exam, and one of the most important and 
sought-after skills of employers. Routers are complex devices that can have a wide 
variety of possible configurations. 
 
Concept Questions 
• 
What does it mean to configure a router?  
Router configuration information can be generated by several means. You can 
use the privileged EXEC configure command to configure from a virtual 
(remote) terminal, a modem connection, or a console terminal. This enables you 
to enter changes to an existing configuration at any time. 
You can also use the privileged EXEC configure command to load a 
configuration from a network TFTP server, which enables you to maintain and 
store configuration information at a central site. 
• 
Why must routers be configured? 
A router must know which interfaces are to be used, which routed and routing 
protocols are supported, along with security and access list configurations. 
• 
Describe the router configuration process. 
You can configure a router from many external locations, including the following: 
⇒ 
From the console terminal (a computer connected to the router through a 
console port) during its installation 
⇒ 
Via a modem by using the auxiliary port 
⇒ 
From virtual terminals, after the router has been installed on the network 
⇒ 
From a TFTP server on the network

• 
Explain the router password recovery procedure on 1600 and 2500 series 
routers. 
Step-by-step procedure (1600 Router): 
Step 2. 
Attach a terminal or PC with terminal emulation to the console port of 
the router. Use the following terminal settings:  
9600 baud rate  
No parity  
8 data bits  
1 stop bit  
No flow control 
Step 6. 
If you still have access to the router, type show version and record 
the setting of the configuration register; it is usually 0x2102 or 0x102.  
Step 7. 
If you don't have access to the router (because of a lost login or 
TACACS password), you can safely consider that your configuration 
register is set to 0x2102.  
Step 8. 
Using the power switch, turn off the router and then turn it back on.  
Step 9. 
Press Break on the terminal keyboard within 60 seconds of the power 
up to put the router into ROMMON.  
Step 10. 
Type confreg 0x2142 at the rommon 1> prompt to boot from Flash 
without loading the configuration.  
Step 11. 
Type reset at the rommon 2> prompt.  
The router reboots but ignores its saved configuration. 
Step 12. 
Type no after each setup question or press Ctrl+C to skip the initial 
setup procedure.  
Step 13. 
Type enable at the Router> prompt.  
You'll be in enable mode and see the Router# prompt. 
Step 14. 
Important: Type config mem or copy start running to copy the 
nonvolatile RAM (NVRAM) into memory. Do not type config term.  
Step 15. 
Type wr term or show running.  
The show running and wr term commands show the 
configuration of the router. In this configuration you see under all the 
interfaces the shutdown command, which means all interfaces are 
currently shutdown. Also, you can see the passwords either in 
encrypted or unencrypted format. 
Step 16. 
Type config term and make the changes.  
The prompt is now hostname(config)#. 

 
189 - 239  Engineering Journal and Workbook, Vol. I, 2nd Ed. – Chapter 22  Copyright © 2002 Cisco Systems, Inc. 
Step 17. 
Type enable secret password.  
Step 18. 
Issue the no shutdown command on every interface that is used. If 
you issue a show ip interface brief command, every interface 
that you want to use should be "up up".  
Step 19. 
Type config-register 0x2102 or the value you recorded in step 
2.  
Step 20. 
Press Ctrl+Z to leave the configuration mode.  
The prompt is now hostname#. 
Step 21. 
Type write mem or copy running startup to commit the 
changes.  
Step-by-step procedure (2500 Router): 
Step 1. 
Attach a terminal or PC with terminal emulation to the console port of 
the router. Use the following terminal settings:  
9600 baud rate  
No parity  
8 data bits  
1 stop bit  
No flow control  
Step 2. 
Using the power switch, turn the router off and then turn it back on.  
Step 3. 
Press Break on the terminal keyboard within 60 seconds of the 
power-up to put the router into ROMMON.  
Step 4. 
Type o at the > prompt and record the current value of the 
configuration register (usually 0x2102, or 0x102):  
>o 
Configuration register = 0x2102 at last boot 
Bit#  Configuration register option settings:  
15   Diagnostic mode disabled  
Step 5. Type o/r 0x2142 at the > prompt to boot from Flash without loading the 
configuration.  
Step 6. Type i at the > prompt.  
The router reboots, but ignores its saved configuration. 
Step 7. Type no after each setup question or press Ctrl+C to skip the initial setup 
procedure.  
Step 8. Type enable at the Router> prompt.  
You'll be in enable mode and see the Router# prompt.

Step 9. Important: Type config mem or copy start running to copy the 
nonvolatile RAM (NVRAM) into memory. Do not type config term.  
Step 10. 
Type wr term or show running.  
The show running and wr term commands show the 
configuration of the router. In this configuration, you see under all the 
interfaces the shutdown command, which means all interfaces are 
currently shut down. Also, you can see the passwords either in 
encrypted or unencrypted format. 
Step 11. 
Type config term and make the changes.  
The prompt is now hostname(config)#. 
Step 12. 
Type enable secret password.  
Step 13. 
Issue the no shutdown command on every interface that is used. If 
you issue a show ip interface brief command, every interface 
that you want to use should be "up up".  
Step 14. 
Type config-register 0x2102 or the value you recorded in step 
4.  
Step 15. 
Press Ctrl+Z to leave the configuration mode.  
The prompt is now hostname#. 
Step 16. 
Type write mem or copy running startup to commit the 
changes.

Chapter 23 
TCP/IP 
Introduction 
The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite of protocols was 
developed as part of the research done by the Defense Advanced Research Projects 
Agency (DARPA). Later, TCP/IP was included with the Berkeley Software Distribution of 
UNIX. 
The Internet protocols can be used to communicate across any set of interconnected 
networks. They are equally well suited for both LAN and WAN communication. 
The IP suite includes not only Layer 3 and Layer 4 specifications (such as IP and TCP), 
but also specifications for such common applications as e-mail, remote login, terminal 
emulation, and file transfer. 
 
Concept Questions 
Demonstrate your knowledge of these concepts by answering the following questions in 
the space provided. 
The TCP/IP protocol stack has the following components: 
⇒ 
Protocols to support file transfer, e-mail, remote login, and other applications. 
⇒ 
Reliable and unreliable transports. 
⇒ 
Connectionless datagram delivery at the network layer ICMP provides control 
and message functions at the network layer. 
• 
The TCP/IP protocol stack maps closely to the lower layers of the OSI reference 
model. What function do the application protocols perform? 
⇒ 
They provide services to application processes that are outside of the 
OSI model.  
⇒ 
They identify and establish the availability of intended communication 
partners.  
⇒ 
They synchronize cooperating applications. 
⇒ 
They establish agreement on procedures for error recovery and control of 
data integrity.

• 
The transport layer performs two functions. What are they? 
The transport layer enables a user’s device to segment data from several upper-
layer applications for placement on the same Layer 4 data stream, and enables a 
receiving device to reassemble the upper-layer application segments. The Layer 
4 data stream is a logical connection between the endpoints of a network; it 
provides transport services from a source host to a destination host. This service 
is sometimes referred to as an end-to-end service. 
• 
What kind of protocol is TCP? 
TCP is a connection-oriented, reliable protocol that provides flow control by 
providing sliding windows and offers reliability by providing sequence numbers 
and acknowledgments. TCP resends anything that is not acknowledged and 
supplies a virtual circuit between end-user applications. The advantage of TCP is 
that it provides guaranteed delivery of segments. 
 
Vocabulary Exercise Chapter 23 
Define the following terms as completely as you can. Use the online Chapter 23 or the 
Cisco Systems Networking Academy: First-Year Companion Guide, Second Edition, 
material for help. 
Acknowledgment number     Next expected TCP octet.  
ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)     Internet protocol used to map an IP address to 
a MAC address. Defined in RFC 826. 
Checksum     1) Method for checking the integrity of transmitted data. A checksum is an 
integer value computed from a sequence of octets taken through a series of arithmetic 
operations. The value is recomputed at the receiving end and compared for verification. 
2) Calculated checksum of the header and data fields. 
Destination port     Number of the called port. 
Flow control      Technique for ensuring that a transmitting entity, such as a modem, 
does not overwhelm a receiving entity with data. When the buffers on the receiving 
device are full, a message is sent to the sending device to suspend the transmission 
until the data in the buffers has been processed. 
Handshake     Sequence of messages exchanged between two or more network 
devices to ensure transmission synchronization. 
HLEN     Number of 32-bit words in the header. 
RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol)     Protocol in the TCP/IP stack that 
provides a method for finding IP addresses based on MAC addresses. 
Sequence number     Number used to ensure correct sequencing of the arriving data.  
Source port     Number of the calling port. 
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)     Connection-oriented transport layer protocol 
that provides reliable full-duplex data transmission. TCP is part of the TCP/IP protocol 
stack. 

 
196 - 239  Engineering Journal and Workbook, Vol. I, 2nd Ed. – Chapter 23  Copyright © 2002 Cisco Systems, Inc. 
UDP (User Datagram Protocol)     Connectionless transport layer protocol in the 
TCP/IP protocol stack. UDP is a simple protocol that exchanges datagrams without 
acknowledgments or guaranteed delivery, requiring that error processing and 
retransmission be handled by other protocols. UDP is defined in RFC 768. 
Window     Number of octets that the receiver is willing to accept. 
Window size      Refers to the number of messages that can be transmitted while 
awaiting an acknowledgment.

Compare and contrast TCP and UDP.  
TCP is a connection-oriented, reliable protocol that provides flow control by 
providing sliding windows and offers reliability by providing sequence numbers 
and acknowledgments. TCP resends anything that is not acknowledged and 
supplies a virtual circuit between end-user applications. The advantage of TCP is 
that it provides guaranteed delivery of segments 
UDP is a connectionless and unreliable protocol that is responsible for 
transmitting messages but provides no software checking for segment delivery. 
The advantage that UDP provides is speed. Because UDP provides no 
acknowledgments, less control traffic is sent across the network, making the 
transfer faster.

Briefly describe everything you know about the fields in a TCP segment.  
The TCP segment contains the following fields: 
Source Port—The number of the source (port) for this segment. 
Destination port—The number of the destination (port) for this segment. 
Sequence Number—The number used to ensure correct sequencing of the 
arriving data. It is the number assigned to the first octet in the user data field. 
Acknowledgment Number—The next expected TCP octet. 
HLEN—The number of 32-bit words in the header. 
Reserved—Set to 0. 
Code Bits—The control functions (for example, setup and termination of a 
session). 
Window—The number of octets that the sender is willing to accept. 
Checksum—The calculated checksum of the header and data fields. 
Urgent Pointer—Indicator of the end of the urgent data. 
Option—One currently defined: maximum TCP segment size. 
Data—Upper-layer protocol data. 
4. 
Briefly describe everything you know about the fields in an IP datagram.  
The fields in this IP datagram are as follows: 
VES—Version number 
HLEN—Header length, in 32-bit words 
Type of Service—How the datagram should be handled 
Total Length—Total length (header + data) 
Identification, Flags, Frag Offset—Provides fragmentation of datagrams to 
allow differing MTUs in the internetwork 
TTL—Time-To-Live 
Protocol—The upper-layer (Layer 4) protocol sending and receiving the 
datagram 
Header Checksum—In integrity check on the header 
Source IP Address and Destination IP Address—32-bit IP addresses 
IP Options—Network testing, debugging, security, and other options

Briefly distinguish between IP, ICMP, ARP, and RARP.  
IP serves as a protocol for many of the services used on the Internet today, such 
as SMTP, HTTP, DNS, Telnet, and so on. ICMP provides control and message 
functions at the network layer. ICMP is implemented by all TCP/IP hosts. ARP is 
used to resolve or map a known IP address to a MAC sublayer address to allow 
communication on a multi-access medium, such as Ethernet. RARP is the 
reverse of ARP and is used to resolve or map a known MAC sublayer address to 
an IP address.

200 - 239  Engineering Journal and Workbook, Vol. I, 2nd Ed. – Chapter 23  Copyright © 2002 Cisco Systems, Inc. 
5. 
What does a TCP sliding window do? 
a. 
It makes the window larger so more data can come through at once, 
which results in more efficient use of bandwidth. 
b. 
The window size slides to each section of the datagram to receive data, 
which results in more efficient use of bandwidth. 
c. 
It allows the window size to be negotiated dynamically during the TCP 
session, which results in more efficient use of bandwidth.  
d. 
It limits the incoming data so that each segment must be sent one by 
one, which is an inefficient use of bandwidth. 
6. 
What do the TCP sequence and acknowledgment numbers do? 
a. 
They break datagrams into their binary coefficients, number them 
sequentially, and send them to their destination, where the sender 
acknowledges their receipt. 
b. 
They break messages down into datagrams that are numbered and then 
sent to a host according to the sequence set by the source TCP. 
c. 
They provide a system for sequencing datagrams at the source and 
acknowledging them at the destination.  
d. 
They provide sequencing of segments with a forward reference 
acknowledgment, number datagrams before transmission, and 
reassemble the segments into a complete message.  
7. 
Why does UDP use application layer protocols to provide reliability? 
a. 
To speed up transmission over the network. 
b. 
The lack of reliability protocols makes the software less expensive and 
easier to configure. 
c.

IP Addressing 
Introduction 
In a TCP/IP environment, end stations communicate with servers or other end stations. 
This occurs because each node using the TCP/IP protocol suite has a unique 32-bit 
logical address. This address is known as the IP address. 
Each company listed on the internetwork is seen as a single unique network that must 
be reached before an individual host within that company can be contacted. Each 
company network has an address; the hosts that live on that network share that same 
network address, but each host is identified by the unique host address on the network. 
 
Concept Questions 
Demonstrate your knowledge of these concepts by answering the following questions in 
the space provided. 
• 
IP addresses are specified in 32-bit dotted-decimal format. Explain how to 
develop an IP address. 
Each node using the TCP/IP protocol suite has a unique 32-bit logical address. 
This address is specified in 32-bit dotted-decimal format. The IP address is 
almost always accompanied by the subnet mask, also in 32-bit dotted-decimal 
format. The subnet mask indicates which of the 32 bits in the IP address are 
used for network representation and which bits are used for host representation. 
The network bits are assigned by InterNIC or ARIN. The host bits are determined 
by you, the network administrator. 
• 
Router interfaces can be configured with an IP address. 
• 
ping and trace commands can be used to verify IP address configuration.  
• 
What actually happens when you issue a ping command? Explain verbally 
and with a sketch. 
The ping command sends a packet to the destination host and then waits for a 
reply packet from that host.  Results from this echo protocol can help evaluate 
the path-to-host reliability, identify delays over the path, and determine whether 
the host can be reached or is functioning. 
Student sketch should be similar to that of Figure 18-11.

Define the following terms as completely as you can. Use the online Chapter 24 or the 
Cisco Systems Networking Academy: First-Year Companion Guide, Second Edition, 
material for help. 
Broadcast     Data packet that will be sent to all nodes on a network. Broadcasts are 
identified by a broadcast address. 
DNS (Domain Name System)     System used in the Internet for translating names of 
network nodes into addresses. 
Flooding     Traffic-passing technique used by switches and bridges in which traffic 
received on an interface is sent out all of the interfaces of that device except the 
interface on which the information was originally received. 
Host     Computer system on a network. Similar to the term node except that host 
usually implies a computer system; whereas, node generally applies to any networked 
system, including access servers and routers. 
Network     1) Collection of computers, printers, routers, switches, and other devices 
that are able to communicate with each other over some transmission medium. 2) 
Command that assigns a NIC-based address to which the router is directly connected. 
3) Command that specifies any directly connected networks to be included. 
Ping (Packet Internet Groper)     An ICMP echo message and its reply. Often used in 
IP networks to test the reachability of a network device. 
Subnetwork     1) In IP networks, a network sharing a particular subnet address. 
Subnetworks are networks arbitrarily segmented by a network administrator to provide a 
multilevel, hierarchical routing structure while shielding the subnetwork from the 
addressing complexity of attached networks. Sometimes called a subnet. 2) In OSI 
networks, a collection of ESs and ISs under the control of a single administrative domain 
and using a single network access protocol. 
Telnet      A standard terminal emulation protocol in the TCP/IP protocol stack. Telnet 
is used for remote terminal connection, enabling users to log in to remote systems and 
use resources as if they were connected to a local system. Telnet is defined in RFC 
854. 
Trace      Command that uses Time-To-Live (TTL) values to generate messages from 
each router used along the path. This is very powerful in its capability to locate failures 
in the path from the source to the destination.

Routing 
Introduction 
Which path should traffic take through the cloud of networks? Path determination occurs 
at Layer 3 of the OSI reference model, the network layer. The path determination 
function enables a router to evaluate the available paths to a destination and to establish 
the preferred handling of a packet.  
Routing services use network topology information when evaluating network paths. This 
information can be configured by the network administrator or collected through dynamic 
processes running in the network. 
The network layer interfaces to networks and provides best-effort, end-to-end packet 
delivery services to its user, the transport layer. The network layer sends packets from 
the source network to the destination network based on the IP routing table.  
After the router determines which path to use, it proceeds with forwarding the packet: It 
takes the packet it accepted on one interface and forwards it to another interface or port 
that reflects the best path to the packet’s destination. 
 
Concept Questions 
Demonstrate you knowledge of these concepts by answering the following questions in 
the space provided. 
• 
Internetworking functions of the network layer include network addressing and 
best path selection for traffic. What is best-path selection? 
The network layer uses the IP routing table to send packets from the source 
network to the destination network. After the router determines which path to 
use, it proceeds with forwarding the packet. It takes the packet that it accepted 
on one interface and forwards it to another interface or port that reflects the best 
path to the packet’s destination. 
• 
In network addressing, one part of the address is used to identify the path used 
by the router and the other is used for ports or devices on the network. Which 
part of the address is used to identify the path used by the router? 
The router uses the network portion of the address to make path selections to 
pass the packet to the next router along the path. 

 
213 - 239  Engineering Journal and Workbook, Vol. I, 2nd Ed. – Chapter 25  Copyright © 2002 Cisco Systems, Inc. 
• 
Routed protocols allow routers to direct user traffic, and routing protocols work 
between routers to maintain path tables. Explain this key difference. 
Routed protocol—Any network protocol that provides enough information in its 
network layer address to allow a packet to be forwarded from one host to 
another host based on the addressing scheme. Routed protocols define the field 
formats within a packet. Packets are generally conveyed from end system to end 
system. A routed protocol uses the routing table to forward packets. The Internet 
Protocol (IP) is an example of a routed protocol. 
Routing protocol—Support a routed protocol by providing mechanisms for 
sharing routing information. Routing protocol messages move between the 
routers. A routing protocol allows the routers to communicate with other routers 
to update and maintain tables. TCP/IP examples of routing protocols include the 
following: 
⇒ 
Routing Information Protocol (RIP) 
⇒ 
Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP) 
⇒ 
Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) 
⇒ 
Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) 
• 
Network discovery for distance-vector routing involves exchange of routing 
tables; problems can include slow convergence. What other problems can 
occur as a result of exchanging routing tables? 
Routing loops can occur if a network’s slow convergence on a new configuration 
causes inconsistent routing entries. 
• 
For link-state routing, routers calculate the shortest paths to other routers; 
problems can include inconsistent updates. What other problems might occur 
with link-state routing? 
Two link-state concerns exist: processing and memory requirements, and 
bandwidth requirements 
• 
Balanced hybrid routing uses attributes of both link-state and distance-vector 
routing, and can apply paths to several protocols. What advantages does 
balance hybrid routing offer? 
Balanced hybrid routing protocols use distance vectors with more accurate 
metrics to determine the best paths to destination networks. However, they differ 
from most distance-vector protocols by using topology changes to trigger routing 
database updates. The balanced hybrid routing protocol converges rapidly, like 
the link-state protocols.

Vocabulary Exercise Chapter 25 
Define the following terms as completely as you can. Use the online Chapter 25 or the 
Cisco Systems Networking Academy: First-Year Companion Guide, Second Edition 
material for help. 
Default route     Routing table entry that is used to direct frames for which a next hop is 
not explicitly listed in the routing table.  
Delay      The time between the initiation of a transaction by a sender and the first 
response received by the sender. Also the time required to move a packet from source 
to destination over a given path.  
Dynamic routing     Routing that adjusts automatically to network topology or traffic 
changes. Also called adaptive routing.  
Enhanced IGRP (EIGRP) Advanced version of IGRP developed by Cisco. Provides 
superior convergence properties and operating efficiency, and combines the advantages 
of link-state protocols with those of distance-vector protocols. 
Header     Control information placed before data when encapsulating that data for 
network transmission.  
Hop count     Routing metric used to measure the distance between a source and a 
destination. RIP uses hop count as its sole metric.  
Hop     Term describing the passage of a data packet between two network nodes (for 
example, between two routers).  
IGRP (Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)     IGRP was developed by Cisco to 
address the problems associated with routing in large, heterogeneous networks.  
OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)     Link-state, hierarchical IGP routing algorithm 
proposed as a successor to RIP in the Internet community. OSPF features include least-
cost routing, multipath routing, and load balancing. OSPF was derived from an early 
version of the ISIS protocol.  
RIP (Routing Information Protocol)     IGP supplied with UNIX BSD systems. The 
most common IGP in the Internet. RIP uses hop count as a routing metric.  
Routing metric     Method by which a routing algorithm determines that one route is 
better than another. This information is stored in routing tables. Metrics include 
bandwidth, communication cost, delay, hop count, load, MTU, path cost, and reliability. 
Sometimes referred to simply as a metric.  
Routing protocol     Protocol that accomplishes routing through the implementation of 
a specific routing algorithm. Examples of routing protocols include IGRP, OSPF, and 
RIP.

Focus Questions 
1. 
What does a router do? What improvements do network addresses offer 
over physical addresses?  
Routers are internetworking devices that operate at OSI Layer 3 (the network 
layer). They tie together, or interconnect, network segments or entire networks, 
as shown in Figure 10-3. They pass data packets between networks based on 
Layer 3 information. Network addresses have logical or hierarchical addresses, 
which allows for the grouping of end stations into such things as departments, 
floors, or buildings. 
2. 
Distinguish between routed protocols and routing protocols. 
Routed protocols are used between router to direct user traffic. Any network 
protocol that provides enough information in its network layer address to be 
forwarded from host to host based on the addressing scheme is a routed 
protocol.      
The most relevant example for this discussion is IP. Routing protocols are used 
only between routers to maintain routing tables. Examples are RIP and IGRP. 
Routing protocols support routed protocols by providing a mechanism for sharing 
routing information messages among routers. 
3. 
How does multiprotocol routing enable the Internet to exist? 
There are many different host systems all over the world, with many different 
routed protocols. Multiprotocol routing—by which a router can pass traffic from 
Novell, Apple, DEC, IP and many other networks—allows these diverse hosts to 
communicate. 
4. 
List and briefly describe at least five examples of routing metrics. 
The metrics most commonly used by routers include the following: 
Bandwidth—The data capacity of a link 
Delay—Length of time required to move a packet from source to destination 
Load—Amount of activity on a network resource such as a router or a link 
Reliability—Usually refers to the error rate of each network link 
Hop count—Number of passages of a packet through the output port of one 
router 
Ticks—Delay on a data link using IBM PC clock ticks 
Cost—Arbitrary value, usually based on bandwidth or other measurements, that 
is assigned by the network administrator 
5. 
Briefly describe distance-vector routing. 
Distance vector-based routing algorithms pass periodic copies of a routing table 
from router to routers; each router receives a routing table from its direct 
neighbors.

Routing Protocols 
Introduction 
After testing the hardware and loading the Cisco IOS system image, the router finds and 
applies the configuration statements. These entries provide the router with details about 
router-specific attributes, protocol functions, and interface addresses. 
If the router faces a beginning condition where the router is unable to locate a valid 
startup-config file, however, it enters an initial router configuration mode called the setup 
mode.  
With the setup-mode command facility, you can answer questions in the system 
configuration dialog. This facility prompts you for basic configuration information. The 
answers you enter enable the router to use a sufficient, but minimal, feature router 
configuration, which includes the following: 
• 
An inventory of interfaces  
• 
An opportunity to enter global parameters 
• 
An opportunity to enter interface parameters  
• 
A setup script review  
• 
An opportunity to indicate whether you want the router to use this configuration  
After you approve setup-mode entries, the router uses the entries as a running 
configuration. The router also stores the configuration in NVRAM as a new startup-
config. You can start using the router. For additional protocol and interface changes, 
use the enable mode and enter the command configure. 
 
Concept Questions 
Demonstrate your knowledge of these concepts by answering the following questions in 
the space provided. 
• 
Routers can be configured to use one or more IP routing protocols. Identify and 
briefly explain the different IP routing protocols. 
At the Internet layer of the TCP/IP suite of protocols, a router can use an IP 
routing protocol to accomplish routing through the implementation of a specific

Two IP routing protocols are RIP and IGRP. Compare and contrast these two 
IP routing protocols. 
RIP was originally specified in RFC 1058. Its key characteristics include the 
following: 
It is a distance-vector routing protocol. 
Hop count is used as the metric for path selection (see Figure 26-8). 
If the hop count is greater than 15, the packet is discarded. 
By default, routing updates are broadcast every 30 seconds. 
IGRP is a distance-vector routing protocol developed by Cisco. IGRP sends 
routing updates at 90-second intervals, advertising networks for a particular 
autonomous system. Some of the IGRP key design characteristics emphasize 
the following: 
Versatility that enables it to automatically handle indefinite, complex topologies 
Flexibility for segments that have different bandwidth and delay characteristics 
Scalability for functioning in very large networks 
 
Vocabulary Exercise Chapter 26      
Define the following terms as completely as you can. Use the online Chapter 26 or the 
Cisco Systems Networking Academy: First-Year Companion Guide, Second Edition 
material for help.  
Autonomous system     Collection of networks under a common administration sharing 
a common routing strategy. Autonomous systems are subdivided by areas. An 
autonomous system must be assigned a unique 16-bit number by the IANA. Sometimes 
abbreviated AS.  
Bandwidth     The difference between the highest and lowest frequencies available for 
network signals. The term is also used to describe the rated throughput capacity of a 
given network medium or protocol. 
Delay     The time between the initiation of a transaction by a sender and the first 
response received by the sender. Also, the time required to move a packet from source 
to destination over a given path.  
Distance-vector routing algorithm     Class of routing algorithms that iterate on the 
number of hops in a route to find a shortest-path spanning tree. Distance-vector routing 
algorithms call for each router to send its entire routing table in each update, but only to 
its neighbors. Distance-vector routing algorithms can be prone to routing loops, but are 
computationally simpler than link-state routing algorithms. Also called Bellman-Ford 
routing algorithm.  
Dynamic routing     Routing that adjusts automatically to network topology or traffic 
changes. Also called adaptive routing. 
Enhanced IGRP (EIGRP)     Advanced version of IGRP developed by Cisco. Provides 
superior convergence properties and operating efficiency, and combines the advantages 
of link-state protocols with those of distance-vector protocols. Compare with IGRP.  

 
233 - 239  Engineering Journal and Workbook, Vol. I, 2nd Ed. – Chapter 26  Copyright © 2002 Cisco Systems, Inc. 
IGRP (Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)     IGP developed by Cisco to address the 
problems associated with routing in large, heterogeneous networks. Compare with 
EIGRP. See also IGP, OSPF, and RIP.  
Link-state routing algorithm     Routing algorithm in which each router broadcasts or 
multicasts information regarding the cost of reaching each of its neighbors to all nodes 
in the internetwork. Link-state algorithms create a consistent view of the network and 
are therefore not prone to routing loops, but they achieve this at the cost of relatively 
greater computational difficulty and more widespread traffic (compared with distance-
vector routing algorithms).  
MTU ( maximum transmission unit)     Maximum packet size, in bytes that a particular 
interface can handle. 
OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)     Link-state, hierarchical IGP routing algorithm 
proposed as a successor to RIP in the Internet community. OSPF features include least-
cost routing, multipath routing, and load balancing. OSPF was derived from an early 
version of the IS-IS protocol.  
Reliability     Ratio of expected to received keepalives from a link. If the ratio is high, 
the line is reliable. Used as a routing metric. 
RIP (Routing Information Protocol)     IGP supplied with UNIX BSD systems. The 
most common IGP in the Internet, RIP uses hop count as a routing metric.  
Static route     Route that is explicitly configured and entered into the routing table. 
Static routes take precedence over routes chosen by dynamic routing protocols.

Describe some network troubleshooting strategies. 
It’s useful to have a general method to refer to when troubleshooting computer 
networks. This section outlines one such method used by many networking 
professionals. 
The steps are as follows: 
Step 1. 
Define the problem. What are the symptoms and the potential 
causes? 
Step 2. 
Gather the facts. Isolate the possible causes. 
Step 3. 
Consider the possibilities. Based on the facts gathered, narrow the 
focus to areas relevant to the specific problem. This is the step where 
you set the boundaries for the problem. 
Step 4. 
Create an action plan. Devise a plan in which you manipulate only 
one variable at a time. 
Step 5. 
Implement the action plan. Perform each step carefully while testing 
to see whether the symptom disappears. 
Step 6. 
Observe the results. Determine whether you resolved the problem. If 
so, the process is complete. 
Step 7. 
Repeat the process. If you did not resolve the problem, move to the 
next most likely cause on your list. Return to step 4, and repeat the 
process until you solve the problem.
