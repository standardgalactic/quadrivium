Introduction
W
elcome (almost) to the world of home ownership! The fact that 
you’ve picked up this book and flipped it open to the Introduc-
tion says you’re serious about buying a home, and you’re look-
ing for step-by-step guidance through the process—from finding the right 
home to signing the papers that make it yours. Either way, you’ve come to 
the right place.
Buying a home is a big step. In fact, it’s many big steps—to the first-time 
homebuyer, the process can seem long, complex, and more than a little 
confusing. This book takes the confusion out of buying a home, guiding 
you through each step of the process and offering tips and information 
along the way. And if you’ve bought property before, this book serves as 
a step-by-step refresher course with information on all the current real-
estate practices. Neophyte or veteran, you’ll feel confident about one of 
the biggest decisions you’ll ever make.

Introduction

Should You Rent or Buy?
Home ownership is a big step, and many people worry whether they’re 
ready to take it. If you currently rent your house, you may wonder if you 
can even afford to buy a home. Just looking at real estate listings online or 
in the Sunday paper can make you break out in a cold sweat. Yes, homes 
are expensive. But they’re also an investment—and for many homeowners, 
it’s one of the smartest investments they’ll make. Depending on how much 
you currently pay for rent, how expensive homes are in your area, what 
your credit score looks like, and how long you plan to live in the house 
(among other factors), buying a home is often less expensive than renting 
in the long run. after all, when you rent, you just pay for a roof over your 
head. When you buy, you become the owner of that roof—and everything 
beneath it.
renting does have its advantages. Here are some:
•  Renting offers more flexibility. If you like knowing that you can pack 
up and move at a moment’s (or a month’s) notice, it may make more 
sense to rent. Depending on the terms of your lease, you’re not tied 
to a residence for more than a year or two at most. When you own 
a home, on the other hand, you need to sell the property or find a 
suitable tenant before you can move—or else you’ll end up paying a 
mortgage on an empty house.
•  Maintenance is someone else’s headache. When you rent, you call 
the landlord if a pipe bursts or the furnace quits. He sends someone to 
fix it—and takes care of the bill. When you own, all the maintenance—
from keeping everything in good repair to mowing the lawn and shov-
eling snow—is your responsibility.
To see whether renting or buying makes better financial sense for you, use 
myFIco’s “am I better off renting?” calculator. You can find it at http://tinyurl.com/
yagk6lr.
If you know you’re likely to move within three or four years, you’re probably better 
off renting than buying. That’s because you won’t have time to build up much eq-
uity in your house (its cash value as you pay off your mortgage’s principal) or break 
even on your closing costs. (chapter 9 gives you an overview of the many costs 
associated with buying a home.)

•	 You can move in faster. Buying a house takes time. If you’re in a hurry 
to move to a new neighborhood, you might want to rent for a year and 
look for a place to buy during that time. Renters can usually move in 
soon after getting their rental application approved. Buying a home, 
on the other hand, takes months. You’ll be living in your new house for 
years, so you want to take your time finding just the right home. Then 
you may spend a couple of weeks negotiating with the seller before 
you agree on a price and conditions. And getting financing and pre-
paring for the property transfer can take 30 days or longer. 
•	 Your move-in costs are lower. Renting a house usually involves no 
more up-front costs than two months’ rent and a security deposit. Buy-
ing a home is far more expensive. You need a down payment of any-
where from 3.5 to 20 percent—or more—of the home’s purchase price 
and thousands of dollars more for the fees and costs associated with 
getting a mortgage (Chapter 9 gives you a rundown of what those are).
•	 You can keep your money in the bank. Being a first-time homeown-
er frequently means scraping together all the money you can find to 
afford a down payment and closing costs. Once you buy a house, your 
money is tied up in your home. After you built up some equity (cash 
value in the house as you make principal payments), you can tap into it 
with a home equity line of credit (page 15). But if you want your money 
readily available (especially within the next few years), or if you want 
to invest in something other than real estate, it may make more sense 
for you to rent.
If you’re thinking about buying a home, you’re already aware that buying 
has its own advantages. Here are some major ones:
•	 Say goodbye to your landlord. It irks some people to pay good mon-
ey each month and not get anything more in return than the right to 
live under someone else’s roof. When you own your home, each mort-
gage payment builds up your equity in the house—not much at first, 
but it increases with time (page 12 explains how that works). Some 
landlords are great, but others are slow to make repairs—and quick to 
raise the rent. If you want to feel like your home is your own, you might 
be ready to buy.
•	 Take advantage of tax breaks. You can deduct mortgage interest, 
property taxes, and some closing costs from your federal income tax-
es. (For the tax savings to make a difference, the deductible items must 
add up to more than the standard deduction—and you’ll have to item-
ize all deductions to claim this tax break.)

Introduction

•	 Beat inflation. As the cost of living goes up, the cost of rent goes right 
up with it. If you use a fixed-rate mortgage (page 163) to buy a home, 
however, your principal and interest payments stay the same for as 
long as you live in the home. The longer you stay there, the more pro-
nounced this benefit.
•	 Build equity. Renting is pay-as-you-go; as long as you pay your rent 
and abide by the terms of your lease, you can live in your home. But 
if you buy, as you make mortgage payments and as home values rise, 
you gain equity in your home. You can treat your home’s equity like a 
savings account, cashing out when you sell the home and using the 
money for a down payment on your next home. Or you can borrow 
against it using a home equity line of credit (page 15).
•	 Have your own place. For many people, the main reason to buy a 
home is to have a place that’s truly their own. You’re not paying off 
the landlord’s mortgage—you’re investing in a home with your name 
on the deed. That’s a great feeling, whether you buy a one-bedroom 
manufactured home or a many-roomed mansion. 
About This Book
You may have heard that now is a good time to buy a home. In many parts 
of the country, prices are down and the number of homes for sale is up, 
creating a buyer’s market. At the same time, news stories of foreclosures 
and other home-buying disasters may have you nervous about taking 
such a big step. 
That’s where Buying a Home: The Missing Manual comes in. It takes the 
mystery and confusion out of buying a home. This book guides you 
through the process, from the moment you wonder whether home owner-
ship is for you until the moment you walk through your new home’s front 
door. Along the way, you’ll get clear explanations, tips, and practical ad-
vice about finding the right home, evaluating neighborhoods, choosing 
the right professionals to work with, making an offer, selecting a mortgage 
and applying for financing, negotiating with the seller, getting a home in-
spection, and making sure closing goes smoothly. There’s a lot to cover, 
and this book will be with you every step of the way. 
Real estate laws vary widely from one state to another. Nothing in this book is 
intended to serve as legal advice. If you have legal questions related to buying a 
home, consult a qualified real estate attorney who’s familiar with your local laws 
and practices.

About the Outline
Buying a Home: The Missing Manual is divided into four parts. Each one 
corresponds to a phase of the home buying process and contains several 
chapters:
•	 Part 1, Preparing for Home Ownership helps you get ready to set 
out on your journey. Before you start looking at homes, you should 
know whether home ownership is the right decision for you, and you 
should establish your target price range. Part 1 has two chapters:  
—
— The Benefits and Drawbacks of Home Ownership (Chapter 1) 
offers a clear-eyed look at the pluses and minuses of owning a 
home. For many people, it’s a cherished dream. To keep that dream 
from becoming a nightmare, make sure you understand the draw-
backs of home ownership as well as the many advantages. This 
chapter fills you in.
—
— How Much Home Can You Afford? (Chapter 2) helps you fig-
ure out how much money you can afford to invest in a home. If 
you’ve never drawn up a monthly budget that lays out your recur-
ring income and expenses, this chapter’s for you. You’ll use that 
information to estimate what you can afford in monthly mortgage 
payments, taking into account related expenses like taxes, mainte-
nance, and utilities. You’ll find out how lenders see your finances 
and decide whether you’re qualified to borrow. You’ll also get tips 
on raising your credit score and learn why it’s a good idea to get 
preapproved for a loan before you start house hunting.
•	 Part 2, Finding Your Home, helps you clarify what you want in a 
home—and then shows you how to find it. This part has three chapters:
—
— Choose Your Style of Home and Neighborhood (Chapter 3) 
describes different types of houses, from traditional single-family 
homes to duplexes to condos and co-ops. You’ll create a wish list 
of all the features you want in your home and identify the neigh-
borhoods where you’ll concentrate your search.
—
— Assemble Your Real Estate Team (Chapter 4) identifies the pro-
fessionals who’ll help make your dreams of home ownership a 
reality. It describes the roles of your real estate agent, mortgage 
broker or loan officer, real estate attorney, and home inspector—
and tells you how to interview each to find the best one.
—
— Shop for Your Home (Chapter 5) gives you a strategy to make 
house hunting more effective and efficient. Use your wish list to 
focus on “must-haves” and “would-likes” as you tour and compare 
homes.

•	 Part 3, Financing Your Home, looks at how and where you get the 
money to buy your house. Find your way through the financing maze 
with the help of these chapters:
—
— Finance Your Down Payment (Chapter 6) is all about the biggest 
up-front expense you’ll face: the 3.5 to 20 percent you need to pay 
up front so a lender will finance the rest. When you’re thinking of 
buying a home that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, com-
ing up with the down payment can be daunting. This chapter ex-
plains how the size of your down payment affects your mortgage 
and suggests ways to come up with the money you need.
—
— Compare Mortgages and Other Financing Options (Chapter 7) 
demystifies mortgages, explaining basic terms and showing you 
the wide variety of loans available. Learn the difference between 
fixed-rate, adjustable, hybrid, and balloon loans—to name a few—
and decide which is best for you. Learn about how your loan’s re-
payment schedule affects how much you pay each month and 
over the life of your loan. And see whether creative financing, such 
as renting to own, may be a good option for you.
—
— Choose and Apply for a Mortgage (Chapter 8) walks you through 
the part of the process that many homebuyers find most intimi-
dating: getting a mortgage. Learn how to find the right lender, 
get the best interest rate, and gather the papers and information 
you need to apply for a loan. Familiarize yourself with the forms 
lenders must send you in return, such as the Good Faith Estimate, 
which shows you the total cost of the loan, and the HUD-1 form, 
which breaks down your closing costs.
—
— Know Your Closing Costs (Chapter 9) reminds you that the down 
payment is only part of the up-front money you need to buy a 
house. This chapter outlines the other costs, including fees related 
to getting a mortgage, inspecting the house, and transferring the 
house’s title from the seller to you.
•	 Part 4, Negotiating and Closing the Deal, is all about making your 
dream home yours, from making a formal offer to closing the sale—
and the 1,001 tasks needed to make that happen:
—
— Make an Offer (Chapter 10) tells you how to make a formal offer 
and negotiate with the seller. An offer is a promise to buy—backed 
up with an “earnest money” deposit—so you need to make sure 
that your offer is written in a way that protects you if you discover 
a problem with the home or can’t get financing.

Tiny URLs
This book mentions lots of great websites you can turn to as you buy a house. 
Sometimes that info is on a very specific page of a site, and the web address that 
takes you there can be awfully long. 
The geeky name for a web address is URL (short for Uniform Resource Locator). 
For example, http://www.google.com is a URL—it tells your web browser to go to 
Google’s home page. But not all URLs are as concise as that. To learn about Bankrate.
com’s free household budgeting worksheet (page 27), for instance, you have to 
go to http://www.bankrate.com/finance/money-guides/free-household-budgeting-
work-sheet.aspx. That’s a lot of gobbledygook to type in, and you have better ways 
to spend your time. That’s where TinyURLs come in.
In 2002, a guy named Kevin Gilbertson started the website TinyURL.com. The site’s 
mission is simple: to shorten ungainly website addresses, like the one for Bankrate.
com. Highlight and copy the address you want to shrink, head over to http://tinyurl.
com, and paste the address in the box. Click the Make TinyURL button and voilà—
the site gives you a much shorter address (which starts with http://tinyurl.com) that 
takes you to the same spot as the long one. 
Throughout this book, you’ll see TinyURLs used in place of giant, clunky ones. To get 
to the Bankrate.com page mentioned earlier, for example, type in http://tinyurl.com/
yeshrvk instead. Better yet, head to this book’s Missing CD page at www.missing-
manuals.com, where you’ll find clickable links to all the sites referenced in this book.

1	 The Benefits and 
Drawbacks of Home 
Ownership
W
hen you buy a home, you open a new chapter in your life. It’s 
a time of both excitement and trepidation. You tour potential 
houses and picture yourself in a new environment. But you also 
worry about how you’ll pay for everything. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed 
by the home-buying process.
This chapter gives you a bird’s-eye view of the benefits and challenges of 
buying a home so you know what to expect. In subsequent chapters, you’ll 
work through these challenges in a logical, step-by-step fashion until you 
get the keys—literally—to your future.

The Pluses of Owning a Home
For many people, home ownership is the ultimate dream. It means you’ve 
got  a  permanent  place  in  the  world—somewhere  you  can  raise  kids, 
gather family and friends, and unwind from a hectic day. Whether you’re 
in a one-bedroom condo or a turreted mansion, owning your own home 
means comfort, safety, and pleasure.
owning your own home comes with practical benefits, too. You can bor-
row against the value of your house, take impressive tax breaks, and treat 
your house as a long-term investment.
A Place of Your Own
People buy homes for a number of reasons, but “I want a place of my 
own” tops the list. When you own your own home, you don’t have to ask 
a landlord if you can wallpaper the dining room, install a luxurious tub in 
the master bath, or paint clouds on the ceiling of your daughter’s bed-
room. You can create an environment that reflects your taste, lifestyle, 
and personality.
on the other hand, you may buy a home because you need more space—
an extra bedroom, an office or family room, perhaps a yard with room for 
kids and pets to run around. or maybe you’re tired of hearing your neigh-
bors through the wall. 
Buying a home also lets you put down long-term roots. You can become 
a permanent part of your neighborhood instead of someone just passing 
through. Settling in may inspire you to become more active in your com-
munity—join the PTa, start a gardening club, or even run for local office. 
a sense of belonging can be one of the most satisfying aspects of home 
ownership.
Equity 
almost everyone takes out a loan to buy a house. as you pay that loan 
back, you build equity in your property. equity is the difference between 
the market value of your home—what someone would pay for it if you 
sold it today—and what you still owe the lender on the loan. If your home 
has a market value of $275,000 and you currently owe the lender $200,000, 
you have $75,000 worth of equity. congratulations!

The Benefits and Drawbacks of Home Ownership
13
You build equity two ways: 
•	 By paying back your loan. Every month, when you pay back part of 
your home loan, you reduce a portion of your principal, the amount of 
cash you borrowed from the lender. (The rest of the monthly payment 
goes to paying interest, what the lender charges you for loaning you 
its money in the first place.) For the first few years, most of each pay-
ment goes toward interest. Over time, however, you pay back more of 
the principal than the interest. And the more you reduce the principal, 
the more equity you have in your house.
•	 By increasing the value of your home. If your home is worth more 
now than it was when you bought it, your home gains in equity. The 
value of your house increases under two circumstances: when hous-
ing prices go up as a result of market conditions and when you make 
improvements to your house (because improvements may put your 
house in a higher price bracket). 
These two factors usually work in tandem. Consider this example: Say 
you find a house you want to buy for $180,000. You pay 10 percent of the 
purchase price ($18,000) in cash as a down payment and borrow the rest, 
$162,000, from a lender in the form of a mortgage. A mortgage is the loan 
you get to buy a house, and it’s defined as the home’s purchase price mi-
nus your down payment.
A few years down the road, as you pay off your mortgage month by month, 
you’ve reduced the loan’s principal by $4,500, to $157,500. At the same 
time, home values in your neighborhood have gone up, and your home is 
now worth $187,500. When you factor in your loan’s reduced principal and 
the home’s increased value, you have $30,000 worth of equity.
You’ll see the term “lender” used throughout this book (instead of the more 
commonplace “bank”) to refer to a mortgage issuer. That’s because many 
institutions besides banks make mortgage loans, including credit unions, 
mortgage companies, and savings and loans institutions.
Some loans let you make extra payments toward your principal each month. That 
reduces the term of your loan (the number of years you have to make mortgage 
payments) and builds your equity faster. See page 178 for the details.

chapter 1
14
 
The beauty of equity is that you don’t have to wait to sell your house to 
benefit from it. You can put it to use right away by borrowing against it 
through either a home equity loan or a home equity line of credit (HeLoc).
Home equity loans
With a home equity loan, you borrow a fixed amount of money, usually at 
a fixed interest rate. You repay the loan over a set period of time, just as 
you do a mortgage. (In fact, this kind of loan is sometimes called a second 
mortgage.) Homeowners often use home equity loans to pay for a single 
large expense, like adding a room or remodeling a kitchen.
Housing prices can also decrease—as they did in many areas of the U.S. when the 
housing bubble burst in the late 2000s. So while homes historically increase in 
value over time, it’s possible that your home could lose equity.
Normally, when you profit by selling an investment, you have to pay a capital 
gains tax on that profit. But when you sell your home, Uncle Sam gives you a 
break. currently, the IrS exempts home-sale profits of up to $250,000 for a single 
homeowner or $500,000 for a married couple who owns a home jointly. That 
means that when you sell your home, you only have to pay capital gains tax on any 
profit over those amounts.
Keep in mind that borrowing against equity means that you’re using your home 
as collateral for the loan, so make sure you don’t borrow more than you can afford 
to pay back. It also means that you now have two loan payments to make each 
month.

The Benefits and Drawbacks of Home ownership
15
Home equity line of credit (HELOC)
For this type of loan, lenders extend you a line of credit based on your eq-
uity rather than giving you a lump-sum payment. Taking into account the 
amount of equity you have in your home, the lender establishes a maxi-
mum line of credit and gives you a book of checks or a special credit card 
that lets you draw on that credit. You can spend any amount at any time for 
any purpose, until you’ve borrowed the maximum. So if your HeLoc gives 
you a line of credit of $50,000, you can draw $5,000 one month, $20,000 
the next, and so on until you reach the $50,000 maximum. 
Most HeLocs have a term of 20 years. Lenders call the first 10 years the 
draw period. That’s because you can tap your line of credit any time during 
that first 10 years. You can pay back some or all of what you borrow dur-
ing the draw period, or you can make interest-only minimum payments. 
after the draw period, your borrowing privileges end. and if you have an 
outstanding balance, your lender amortizes your payments, which means 
she figures out how much you need to pay each month to pay back the 
HeLoc’s principal plus interest over the remaining term of the HeLoc (the 
remaining 10 years in this example). 
HeLocs usually have an adjustable interest rate. That means that the inter-
est you pay goes up and down in conjunction with an established financial 
index, such as the prime rate (the interest rate lenders charge their best 
customers for loans). Some HeLocs have an initial fixed-rate period, dur-
ing which the interest rate stays stable. When that period expires, however, 
your interest rate can change quickly. Your payments also fluctuate de-
pending on how much money you borrow. If you draw $5,000 one month 
and then $15,000 the next, for example, your minimum payment increases 
after the second month.
Some or all of the interest paid on home equity loans and HeLocs is tax 
deductible. The total amount of your home equity debt can’t exceed $100,000 
($50,000 if you’re married but file income taxes separately), and all mortgages on 
the home can’t add up to more than 100 percent of the home’s fair market value. 
check with your accountant or tax adviser to find out how much home equity loan 
interest you can deduct.

Tax Advantages
Uncle Sam loves homeowners—and shows you how much by giving you a 
break on your income taxes. Here’s what you can deduct from your federal 
income tax when you own your home:
•	 Certain costs related to buying the home, such as points you paid (see 
page 157)
•	 Some or all of your mortgage interest
•	 Local property taxes
•	 In some cases, private mortgage insurance (see page 39)
•	 Other home-related costs, such as a home office or improvements you 
make to boost your home’s energy efficiency
Of course, tax laws change frequently, and not everyone qualifies for each 
deduction. Check with your accountant or tax preparer to find out how 
homeowner tax breaks can best benefit you.
Long-Term Investment
Short-term home ownership—say of three years or less—doesn’t always 
make a good investment. Over the short term, the real estate market can 
fluctuate significantly. Home prices can leap up one year, drop sharply the 
next, change a little, or stay flat. In fact, the real estate market can be so 
volatile that if you plan to stay in your house for just a couple of years, 
renting may be a better option. Also, the up-front costs of buying a home 
are high, and you’ve got to live in the home for several years before you 
break even on those initial expenses. Aside from the down payment on the 
house (Chapter 6), you have to pay a long list of other charges and fees to 
get financing and to transfer legal ownership of the house to you (Chapter 
9 outlines these for you). The longer you live in the home, the more those 
initial costs are spread out over time, reducing their impact. For example, if 
you pay $6,000 in purchase fees and live in your house for only two years, 
the fees cost you $3,000 a year and, in all likelihood, your home hasn’t in-
creased in value in that short a time to make the investment worthwhile. 
If you stay in the home for 12 years, however, that initial $6,000 cost you 
only $500 a year (and all the while, presumably, your house has increased 
in value, making the investment a good one).
Finally, lenders calculate your repayment schedule so that, for the first 
few years you pay back the loan, a much bigger chunk of each monthly 
payment goes toward interest rather than principal. Unless you take out 
a shorter-term mortgage (page 177) or make extra payments toward the 
principal (page 178), you won’t build much equity in those first few years. 

The Benefits and Drawbacks of Home Ownership
17
To see an example of how much of each monthly payment goes toward 
interest and how much goes toward principal in the first year of a loan, 
check out the amortization table on page 156.  
If you plan to live in your new home for a while—say, more than six or 
seven years—home ownership is almost always better than renting. Ac-
cording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the average price of a home has risen 
steadily over the past 40 years, as the following table shows.
Year
Average home price (adjusted for 
inflation to current dollar values)
1970
$81,650
1980
$116,780
1990
$126,400
2000
$149,500
The Census Bureau surveys home prices every 10 years, and the data isn’t 
yet in for 2010. But in August 2009, the National Association of Realtors 
reported that the average sale price for an existing home was $177,700. So 
even though prices may slide in the short term, if you’re in it for the long 
haul, your home remains a good investment.
Trading Up
As you shop for a home, you’ll probably encounter the phrase “starter 
home.” Real estate agents use that term to describe property that may be 
of interest to first-time homebuyers. The home may be priced lower than 
others on the market, making it easier for buyers to come up with a down 
payment, or perhaps it’s smaller, so it appeals to single professionals or 
couples without children. 
To get a sense of how long you have to live in the home before owning becomes 
cheaper than renting, try the “Is It Better to Buy or Rent?” calculator on the New 
York Times website at http://tinyurl.com/2sdtvd. Give the calculator information 
about how much you currently pay for rent, the home’s purchase price, the size of 
your down payment, the interest rate of your loan, and the cost of property taxes. 
Click Calculate to get an estimate of the tipping point when buying becomes the 
better deal.
Historically, home prices rise less than other kinds of investments, like stocks and 
bonds. But you need a place to live, and owning your own home means that your 
mortgage payments do triple duty: They provide you with shelter, build equity, 
and offer tax breaks.

Chapter 1
18
“Starter home” also implies that second-time homebuyers move up to 
larger or pricier homes, using the profit from the starter home to beef up 
the down payment on their next home. It’s a sensible strategy; thanks to 
the equity you build up over time, you can usually move up to a home you 
couldn’t afford the first time you went house-hunting.
The Minuses of Owning a Home
There’s a flip side to everything, of course, and home ownership is no ex-
ception. Don’t go through the process of buying a home with your eyes 
shut and your fingers crossed. 
When you figure out how much your new home will cost, purchase price 
is only part of the story—it’s the biggest part, to be sure, but you need to 
expect other costs, too, both one-time and recurring.
One-Time Costs
One-time costs arise from financing your down payment and securing a 
mortgage:
•	 The down payment. This is money you pay up front toward the pur-
chase of a home. Mortgage lenders see the down payment as a sign of 
your intent to buy the house and your ability to repay your loan. These 
days, lenders prefer a down payment of at least 20 percent. You may 
be able to qualify for a lower down payment (FHA-insured loans, page 
180, are the best place to start looking). 
•	 Mortgage-related fees. There are all kinds of costs associated with 
getting a mortgage, such as the application fee, the home-appraisal 
fee, and an origination or processing fee (what the lender charges for 
the administrative tasks involved in processing your application)—
and that’s just for starters, as you’ll see in Chapter 9. 
•	 Other closing costs. Mortgage-related fees are only part of the story. 
To legally transfer ownership of a house (what industry types call clos-
ing on a house), you’ll also pay transfer taxes and recording fees, a title 
search and title insurance fee, settlement fees, and more. To prepare 
for the closing, you’ll pay for a home inspection and buy hazard insur-
ance as well. 
If your down payment is less than 20 percent, you’ll probably have to buy private 
mortgage insurance (page 146), paying monthly premiums until you accrue at 
least 20 percent equity in your home.

Of course, after you borrow money to buy your home, you have to pay the 
lender back. You do this by making a payment to the lender each month. 
Part of each payment goes toward paying back the money you borrowed 
(the principal), and part of it goes toward paying interest on the princi-
pal. But principal and interest aren’t the only recurring payments you have 
to make; you also have to pay taxes and insurance. Some homeowners 
pay these once a year, directly to their tax collector or insurance agent. In 
other cases, the lender itself breaks the annual cost into 12 installments 
and adds them to your principal and interest payments. The lender holds 
the tax and insurance payments in an escrow account (basically, a special-
purpose holding account), and then uses that money to pay your tax and 
insurance bills when they come due. 
You may hear real estate professionals talk about PITI (pronounced pity, as 
in “It’s a pity you have to pay it”). That acronym refers to the four compo-
nents that may make up monthly payments to lenders:
•	 Principal. This is the amount of cash you borrowed from a lender to 
buy your house. You pay it back over the term (the total length) of your 
loan. Each month, part of your payment goes toward paying back the 
principal. 
•	 Interest. Interest is the money you pay your lender for using their 
money to buy your house (“renting” their money is probably more ac-
curate). For the first few years of your mortgage, most of your monthly 
payment goes toward paying interest.
•	 Taxes. This refers to your local property taxes, which support munici-
pal services like sewage, trash pick-up, playgrounds, and the like.
•	 Insurance. This includes homeowner’s insurance and possibly one or 
more of the following: private mortgage insurance (PMI), which lend-
ers require when your down payment is less than 20 percent of the 
home’s purchase price; flood insurance; and homeowners’ association 
fees. Homeowner’s insurance protects your home and its contents in 
case of fire, theft, vandalism, wind damage, and other disasters. It also 
covers you if someone is injured on your property. Page 273 has tips to 
Chapter 9 gives you the details on closing costs, but in general, expect to spend 3 
to 6 percent of your new home’s purchase price on fees and other charges.

help you choose a policy. and if you live in areas that have a high risk 
of flooding, your lender will require you to buy flood insurance in addi-
tion to your homeowner’s policy. FeMa, the Federal emergency Man-

you can get info about flood insurance at www.fema.gov.
Say you borrow $200,000 at an interest rate of 6 percent for a term of 30 
years. Property taxes are $2,000 a year, your homeowner’s insurance policy 
costs $750 a year, and you don’t have to pay PMI. Based on those numbers, 
your monthly payment breaks down like this:
Principal and interest
$1,199.10
Property taxes
$166.66

That’s what you’ll pay the first year. But keep in mind that the amount of 
your monthly payment can change from one year to the next, depending 
on several factors:
•  The type of mortgage loan. If you opt for an adjustable rate mort-
gage (arM; see page 164), your interest rate can change from year to 
year. When the interest rate goes up, so does the interest portion or 
your mortgage. Likewise, if the interest rate goes down, so does your 
interest payment.
•  Tax increases. When your city, town, county, or school district hikes 
taxes, your monthly PITI payment reflects that. You have to pay more 
each month to make sure there’s enough in escrow to pay next year’s 
taxes. Your lender calculates the tax portion of your PITI once a year.

The Benefits and Drawbacks of Home ownership
21
•  Inflation.  This  can  affect  the  cost  of  your  homeowner’s  insurance, 
causing that portion of your payment to rise from year to year.
•  Increased equity. If you put down less than 20 percent to buy your 
house, you can request cancellation of PMI after you build 20 percent 
equity  in  the  home—whether  the  equity  bump  came  from  rising 
home values, payments toward the principal, or both. Getting rid of 
PMI lowers your monthly payment and can save you hundreds or even 
thousands of dollars. By federal law, your lender must cancel PMI when 
your equity in the home reaches 22 percent.
Utilities
When you figure out whether you can afford a home, don’t forget to take 
utilities  into  account.  ask  the  seller  about  monthly  costs  for  electricity, 
heating fuel, cable, Internet access, water, trash removal, and so on. Make 
sure that you can afford these charges along with the PITI.
Maintenance
Whether you buy a brand-new home or an old fixer-upper, sooner or later 
you’ll have to pay maintenance costs. With all the rewards of home owner-
ship comes responsibility—and that means you’re the one who pays the 
bills when the lawn needs mowing, the shutters need painting, or there’s a 
foot of snow in the driveway. You’ll invest your time or your money—and 
probably both—in routine upkeep.
 
In some areas, you may have to pay a one-time connection charge to set up 
utilities. If that’s the case in your neck of the woods, add those connection charges 
to your one-time costs.

22
Repairs
aside from routine and seasonal maintenance, be prepared for other ex-
penses. You may have to replace the water heater, buy a new dishwasher, 
fix a leaky roof, or replace rotting trim. When an appliance dies without 
warning or other issues crop up unexpectedly, you need to find the money 
to fix the problem. once you have sufficient equity in your house, you may 
decide to borrow against that equity. But it’s a good idea to have an emer-
gency fund that you can tap when things go wrong.
Remodeling
You may decide to remodel. Whether you replace carpets, redesign the 
kitchen, build an addition, or wallpaper a room, this can be a significant ex-
pense. on the plus side, remodeling can increase the value of your home 
and build equity faster, so it not only adds to the enjoyment of your home, 
it’s a good investment.
Homeowner’s Fees
Finally, some kinds of homes require monthly fees for maintenance and 
other costs:
•  Condominiums.  as  page  60  explains,  a  condominium  is  a  housing 
arrangement where specific parts of a piece of real estate are owned 
individually (such as apartment-style units in a building or complex of 
buildings) and shared areas and facilities are owned in common and 
controlled by a board that represents all the individual owners. These 
shared areas and facilities include walkways, hallways, elevators, stair-
cases, building exteriors, heating and cooling systems, and perhaps a 
pool and parking lot. Monthly condo fees (sometimes called common 
charges) pay for all this—maintenance to the grounds, exteriors, and 
common areas; lighting in entries, hallways, and the parking lot; insur-
ance; and sometimes a long-term fund for emergencies.
•  Co-ops. Short for housing cooperative, in a co-op, residents own shares 
in a corporation—and the corporation itself owns the real estate. (See 
page 61 for more on the legal ins and outs of co-ops.) If you buying a 
co-op—or, more accurately, shares in a co-op—you pay a monthly fee 
for maintenance and other building-related expenses, just as condo 
owners do.

The Benefits and Drawbacks of Home ownership
23
•  Homeowners’ associations. Some developments of traditional single-
family homes include lots of attractive amenities, such as a commu-
nity pool, tennis courts, a clubhouse, and so on. In such communities, 
a homeowners’ association (Hoa) collects monthly or annual dues to 
pay for these amenities. Some Hoas charge the same dues for each 
home in the development, others base fees on each home’s square 
footage or purchase price, with the owners of bigger and more expen-
sive homes paying more.
Potential for Lost Value
as any investor or Lotto player knows, there’s no such thing as a sure thing. 
When you invest your money, you take a risk, and that’s true when you 
buy a home. even though houses tend to gain value over time, sometimes 
(especially in the short term) they can lose value. a recent example is the 
U.S. housing bubble that peaked in 2005, popped in 2006, and continues 
to deflate in some parts of the country now. Some people who bought at 
the height of the bubble now find themselves with negative equity—they 
owe the lender more money than their home is worth.
Fluctuating markets represent one way a house can lose value, but other 
factors can have the same effect. For example, crime rates could increase 
in your neighborhood, or the city could build a sewage-treatment plant 
a  block  away.  Developers  could  saturate  the  market  with  new  housing 
developments, or a major employer could lay off employees or go out 
of business. You could lose your job and be unable to afford to keep the 
house in good repair.
If you buy a condominium or co-op, your monthly fees will minimize out-of-
pocket costs for routine maintenance. But these kinds of housing also may require 
unanticipated repairs, such as fixing a crack in the community pool, resurfacing 
the parking lot, or scrubbing away graffiti. or a storm may damage the building 
or complex, and even though insurance will cover most of the damage, the 
deductible has to be paid. In such cases, a special assessment, charged to each 
unit, pays the tab—which means you’ll have to chip in.

Reduced Flexibility
When you’re a homeowner, you can’t just pack up and move when wan-
derlust strikes or your company transfers you to a different city. You have 
to continue to pay the mortgage or pay off your home altogether. That 
means you either open your wallet far enough to keep paying the mort-
gage after you move, find a tenant to pay you rent so you can pay the 
mortgage, or sell the house.

2	 How Much Home Can 
You Afford?
N
ow that you’ve decided to buy a home, your next step is to deter-
mine just how much home you can afford. Figuring out your price 
range can take a little time, but it’s important to know what you 
can afford. After all, you’ll be living in your house for years, and you want 
to sleep soundly in it, without worrying about how you’ll make your next 
mortgage payment.
To get a price range, you have to take a look at your finances: how much 
income you have each month versus how much you spend. Taking a good, 
hard look at your budget not only helps you save for a down payment, it 
tells you how much you can afford in mortgage and other home-related 
costs each month. Reviewing your budget has another benefit. It helps 
you see your finances through a lender’s eyes. You can see whether you 
look like a high-risk or a low-risk borrower and take steps to increase your 
chances of getting a mortgage when you’re ready to buy a home.

How Much Can You Invest in a Home?
Before you start shopping for a home, you need to get a realistic sense 
of what you can afford. There’s no point in putting your time, energy, 
and effort—not to mention your emotions—into looking at houses that 
would break your budget. Aside from the sizable down payment (Chap-
ter 6) and closing costs (Chapter 9) that you pay up front, owning a home 
means recurring expenses—principal, interest, taxes, insurance, utilities, 
maintenance, homeowners’ association fees—and occasional emergency 
expenses. Flip back to page 18 for an overview of what it costs to own a 
home.
To get a sense of what you can afford, take the time to get a clear-eyed 
picture of your current finances: develop a monthly budget and look at 
the factors that determine how much you can afford in a mortgage. With a 
monthly budget in hand, you can see how much you can save each month 
toward a down payment (and look for ways to save even more) and get 
a sense of how much you’d be comfortable paying in monthly mortgage 
payments and other recurring costs.
Figure Out a Monthly Budget—and Stick to It
Sitting down to budget your monthly expenses sounds about as much fun 
as scrubbing the kitchen floor, but taking a realistic, clear-eyed look at your 
household finances is essential to understanding how much you can af-
ford in a new home. 
And don’t forget that a mortgage is just one element of home-buying. 
You also need a down payment (Chapter 6), closing costs (Chapter 9), and 
funds for insurance, taxes, maintenance, and repairs. Creating a budget 
helps you plan for these expenses, too.  
Creating a budget isn’t as painful as it sounds when you break it down into 
these main steps:
1.	 Determine your current income and expenses (how much money you 
earn and spend each month).
2.	 Analyze how you spend money now.
3.	 Identify long-term goals (such as saving enough for a down payment 
on a home).
For a lender’s opinion about how large a mortgage you can afford, get prequalified 
or preapproved for a loan. Page 34 tells you more.

Determine your current income and expenses
The first step in budgeting is to figure out how much money comes into 
your household each month. The second step, of course, is to determine 
how much goes out. To do so, you need this information:
•  Your household’s monthly income. Find some recent pay stubs to get 
your after-tax income. (If you get paid biweekly, multiply your after-tax 
pay by 26—because there are 52 weeks in a year—and then divide by 
12 to figure out your monthly pay.) or you can figure out the amount 
by looking at your most recent income tax return: Subtract total tax 
(line 61 on form 1040) from your adjusted gross income (line 38) and 
divide by 12. and don’t forget to include other sources of income: ali-
mony, child support payments you receive, interest, or any other funds 
that come into your household regularly.

If you’re self-employed or you receive income that changes from month to month 
(tips, bonuses, overtime, and so on), figuring out your monthly income is a little 
harder than just looking at a pay stub or two. calculate your monthly income 
the way lenders do, by figuring out your average monthly earnings based on the 
past two years. Get out your W2 or 1099 forms from the past two years, add up 
all the income received during that time. (If you’re using 1099s, look at your last 
two federal and state income tax forms, and subtract the tax you paid from the 
total.) When you’ve got your total income, divide by 24. The result is your average 
monthly income.

•  Your household’s discretionary monthly expenses.  Discretionary 
expenses are the optional ones—the money you spend because you 
want to, not because you have to. It includes items like entertainment, 
eating out, clothing, gifts, and recreational shopping. This is the bud-
get category you’ll scrutinize to see where you can cut back and funnel 
money into a down payment.
Scrutinize recurring monthly expenses to see if you can trim some back, such as 
asking your credit card company to reduce your interest rate or shopping around 
for  cheaper auto insurance. and if you can afford to pay off a loan (such as a 
student loan), you’ll save money on interest and improve your credit score  
(page 39).
Many people are unaware of just how much money goes toward discretionary 
spending. Your credit card statements can help you remember where your money 
went, but it’s also a good idea to keep a log of your spending for a week or a 
month. When you buy anything, from a cup of coffee on your way to work to an 
impulse purchase at the mall, write down what you bought and how much it cost. 
You might be surprised to see where your money goes.

How Much Home Can You Afford?

Analyze how you spend money 
Add up all your sources of income, and then add up all your expenses 
(both recurring and discretionary). Subtract expenses from income and 
the result is your disposable income, the amount of money you have to do 
with as you please:
•	 If the number is positive, you’re saving more than you spend each 
month. You can put this money toward your long-term financial goals.
•	 If the number is negative, you’re spending more than you earn. You 
need to make some changes if you want to buy a home. 
Identify long-term goals
What are your long-term financial goals? You may have several, such as 
saving for a wedding or a vacation, paying college tuition (for yourself or 
your kids), or beefing up your retirement funds. For the sake of simplicity, 
assume that your primary long-term goal is saving for your down payment 
(Chapter 6) and the closing costs (Chapter 9) you need to buy a new home, 
which can easily add up to 25 percent of the purchase price.
What’s your timeframe for buying a home? Multiply your monthly dispos-
able income by number of months between now and your target purchase 
date. Add that number to any savings you’ve already set aside. This gives 
you an idea of how much you can put toward a down payment and clos-
ing costs (see page 233 for a breakdown) if your current financial picture 
remains unchanged. (Page 146 offers strategies for finding money for your 
down payment.)
Reevaluate current spending
If you’re spending more than you earn each month, or if you want to save 
more quickly, you need to identify ways to spend less. Determine how 
much you want to save each month, and adjust your current spending so 
you can reach that goal.
Start with your discretionary expenses. What can you trim or do without? 
You might eat out less often, trade movie night for a night of videos at 
home, or give yourself a monthly clothing budget to prevent impulse buy-
ing. You might be surprised at how much you can save once you start look-
ing for ways to limit spending on nonessentials.
Besides cutting back on spending to save money, you can also look for ways to 
bring more money into your household. A second, part-time job, for example, 
could be a way to make your savings grow faster. Or maybe it’s time to ask your 
boss for a raise (explain that you’re saving to buy a home).

Chapter 2
30
But don’t stop there. Scrutinize what you spend on necessities, too. You 
won’t be able to reduce some of them, like car payments, but others offer 
opportunities to save. Here are a few examples of ways to spend less on 
the things you have to buy each month:
•	 Switch to a lower-tier cable package with fewer premium channels—
or cut out cable altogether.
•	 Switch to a less costly cell phone plan.
•	 Adjust your thermostat by a few degrees to minimize heating and 
cooling costs. 
•	 Cancel subscriptions to magazines that pile up unread on the coffee 
table.
•	 Buy cheaper cuts of meat or replace some meat with less expensive 
but filling alternatives, such as pasta and vegetarian dishes.
•	 Avoid overpriced and nutritionally poor convenience foods.
•	 At the grocery store, compare unit prices and buy the economy size or 
store brand when it’s cheaper than a national brand.
•	 Save gas by eliminating unnecessary trips and by walking, cycling, or 
taking public transportation when possible.
•	 Review your insurance policies to make sure you’re not buying more 
coverage than you need.
•	 If you rent your current home, move to less expensive quarters.
These suggestions should get you thinking about other ways you can lower 
your monthly bills and put the savings toward your long-term financial 
goals.
Track your spending
To stay within your budget, keep track of what you spend each month 
(see the sample budget on the next page). Set aside time to sit down and 
compare your actual expenses with what you budgeted for the month. 
Then, tweak your budget as necessary. If you’re not quite reaching your 
savings goal, go over your expenses again and look for places where you 
can spend less. If you’re spending less than you budgeted, you can either 
add the surplus to your savings or splurge a little—just for this month.

How Much Mortgage Can You Afford?
You may have heard of a formula for determining the maximum amount 
you can afford in a mortgage: Take your household’s gross annual income 
and multiply it by 2.5. It’s quick, it’s easy—and it’s probably misleading. 
The “two-and-a-half-times-income” formula isn’t a bad guideline if you can 
afford a 20 percent down payment and you don’t have much debt. But it 
leaves out important variables that affect how much you can realistically 
pay back each month. This section shows you what to ask yourself when 
you sit down to estimate your price range for a home.
What’s your monthly gross income?
Lenders look at this number to figure out your debt-to-income ratio (page 
36). To do this, they consider your monthly gross income—that’s the 
amount you earn before taxes and other payroll deductions are taken out. 
So grab your pay stubs and check out your gross income; you can also get 
the amount from your latest federal income tax return (line 38 on form 
1040) or W2 form (box 1). Divide by 12 to get your monthly gross.

How much debt do you currently have?
This amount is the other side of the all-important debt-to-income ratio 
(page 36). Using your most recent credit card, bank, and other financial 
statements, see how much you currently owe on outstanding loans and 
credit card balances. or check your credit report, which tallies your existing 
debt. (The box on page 45 tells you how to snag your free copy.) You can 
also call your lenders to get your current balances. add up all the amounts 
you owe to figure out your total debt.
What are your other monthly expenses?
If you figured out your household’s monthly budget (page 26), you know 
what you spend each month for basic necessities, entertainment, and oth-
er items. When you subtract your rent or mortgage payment, you get an 
idea of how much it costs to maintain your current lifestyle.

When it comes to your down payment, size does matter, as chapter 6 ex-
plains. These days, people continue to default on their loans, and many 
lenders require a down payment of 20 percent of a home’s purchase price. 
But the down payment is only part of the cash you need to get a mort-
gage. You need to budget an additional 3 percent to 6 percent of the loan 
amount to pay closing costs and other home-buying–related expenses 
(chapter 9 details these expenses).

lower your monthly payments—and the less you’ll pay over the life of the 
loan. 
If you opt for a fixed-rate mortgage (page 163), your interest rate remains 
steady for the life of the loan. If you choose an adjustable-rate mortgage

What are your future plans?
Polish up your crystal ball and peer five years into the future. Do you antici-
pate any major lifestyle changes? If you plan to go back to school or start a 
family, you’ll have some hefty additional expenses. By looking ahead now 
(and maybe going for a smaller mortgage), you can plan for future expenses 
and avoid being squeezed down the road.
Get Prequalified or Preapproved
You wouldn’t go on a shopping spree with nothing but a checkbook and 
no idea of how much money is in your account. For first-time homebuyers, 
shopping for a home without getting preapproved (or at least prequali-
fied) amounts to the same thing. It’s hard to shop for something when you 
don’t know what you can afford.
To prequalify, you give a loan officer information about your income and 
finances. Based on that information (without checking it), the loan officer 
estimates how much you can afford to borrow. Because prequalification is 
an informal process, without verification of the information you submit, it’s 
not binding on the lender—in other words, there’s no guarantee that the 
lender will approve the amount for which you’ve prequalified when you 
formally apply for a mortgage. But prequalification doesn’t cost anything, 
and it gives you a ballpark idea of what you can afford.
Getting preapproved is a lengthier process that takes a closer look at your 
finances. When you apply for preapproval, the lender verifies the financial 
information you give—info about your employment, cash on hand, credit, 
debt, and so on—and gives you a letter that specifies the maximum loan 
amount you qualify for. To get preapproved, you may have to pay a fee, and 
the lender will check all the information you submit. But preapproval is the 
lender’s guarantee that, as long as you don’t make any drastic changes to 
your financial picture (such as losing your job or taking out a large loan), 
you can get a mortgage up to the stated amount.
Both prequalification and preapproval give you an idea of your price range 
when shopping for a home. The difference is in the level of commitment: 
prequalification is a “maybe”; preapproval is a “yes.”
Use an online calculator, such as Homefair’s (http://tinyurl.com/ydgkmbf) or 
Bankrate.com’s (http://tinyurl.com/yjgnoxf) to get an idea of how much you can 
afford to borrow to buy a home.

How Much Home Can You Afford?

Preapproval offers some real advantages to home buyers:
•	 It shows you mean business. If a seller is deciding among multiple 
offers, a preapproval letter carries some weight, especially if the seller 
is in a hurry to sell. Preapproval means that the seller won’t encounter 
a nasty surprise when the chosen buyer can’t qualify for a mortgage.
•	 You can shop realistically. When you’re preapproved, you won’t 
waste time looking at homes outside of your price range—and that 
can save you the heartache of falling in love with a house, only to find 
out later that you can’t afford it.
•	 It can speed up the closing process. Because your financial in-
formation is already verified, closing can happen faster than if you 
hadn’t been preapproved. You’ll still have to get the home appraised 
and inspected, but you can shave a couple of weeks off the mort-
gage processing time.
For most house hunters, preapproval is a great idea. But if you decide to 
get preapproved, keep these issues in mind:
•	 Preapproval isn’t forever. Your preapproval letter expires after a set 
period of time, often 90 days. If you’re still shopping after that, you 
have to get the letter updated. If your financial situation changes, your 
preapproval amount may change, too.
•	 You’ve been approved, but the property may not be. Before a 
lender gives you a loan, you have to get an independent appraisal to 
confirm the home’s value. If the lender determines that you’ve offered 
more than the home is worth, you may not get the loan—even though 
the purchase price is within your preapproved range.
•	 Preapproval specifies a maximum loan amount. Just because the 
bank has approved you up to a certain amount doesn’t mean you 
should apply for the maximum. You get preapproved for the amount 
the lender determines you can afford, but you may not be comfort-
able paying that amount. Keep in mind other expenses associated 
with home ownership (page 18 gives you a rundown of those) and 
don’t stretch yourself to the limit just because the lender said you 
could afford it.
When you make an offer on a house (Chapter 10), it’s a good idea to include a 
copy of your preapproval letter, because it shows the seller that you’ve already 
got financial backing. If your lender has preapproved you for more than you’re 
offering, ask the lender to write a preapproval letter that mentions the exact 
amount of your offer—not the upper limit of your preapproval. If you’re offering 
$200,000 and the seller sees that you’re preapproved for $250,000, he might hold 
out for a higher price.

What Lenders Look For
 
Income Stability 
Lenders want assurance that your income is steady and sufficient to pay 
back your loan. Income includes your salary or wages, but also commis-
sions, royalties, alimony you receive, Social Security payments, disability 
payments, and any other cash that comes into your home. Be prepared to 
submit copies of your W2 forms or federal income tax returns for the past 
two or three years.
Your Debt-to-Income Ratio
Your lender uses a formula to determine how much you can afford to pay 
for principal and interest each month, based on how much you earn and 
how much you owe. This formula starts with your monthly gross income; 
that’s the figure you determined on page 31. 
Next, the lender uses that income to determine the maximum monthly 
debt you can carry, both for your monthly mortgage payment (PITI, for 
principal,  interest,  taxes,  and  insurance,  page  19)  and  for  your  other 
monthly debt payments, such as those for credit cards, student loans, car 
loans, and so on. 
Most lenders use the 28/36 rule to identify low-risk borrowers, their favor-
ite kind:
•  Your PITI shouldn’t exceed 28 percent of your monthly gross income.
•  Your total monthly debt (including your PITI payments) shouldn’t ex-
ceed 36 percent of your monthly gross income.

How Much Home can You afford?

To figure out your debt-to-income ratio, start with your gross monthly in-
come. Multiply that amount by 0.28 to find the maximum PITI you can af-
ford. Now, go back to your gross monthly income and multiply it by 0.36 
to find your maximum monthly debt. The following table gives you some 
examples, and the worksheets that follow will help you calculate your own

39
Your Home’s Loan-to-Value Ratio
another  important  factor  lenders  consider  in  deciding  whether  to  ap-
prove your mortgage is the home’s loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. This number, 
expressed as a percentage, indicates how much you’re borrowing relative 
to what the home is worth. Basically, the LTV ratio reflects the size of your 
down payment (chapter 6).
Lenders use this formula to figure out the LTV ratio:
LTV ratio = Mortgage amount ÷ Property’s appraised value
So if you want to borrow $200,000 to buy a home worth $250,000, your 
LTV ratio is 0.8, or 80 percent.
The bigger the up-front investment you make in your home, the better 
you look to lenders. That’s why many lenders look for an LTV ratio of 80 per-
cent or lower: It means you’re putting down at least 20 percent of the pur-
chase price as your investment in the home. a higher LTV ratio (that is, a 
number above 80 percent) makes you look like a riskier borrower, because 
you’re investing less of your own money in the purchase. In that case, if the 
lender approves your loan, you’ll probably have to buy private mortgage 
insurance (page 146). With a lower LTV ratio (say, 70 percent or below), you 
may be able to streamline the approval process or get a more favorable 
interest rate.
For a lender to determine your LTV ratio, you need to have an independent 
appraiser determine your home’s value based on the current market (page 
227) and you need to provide documentation showing how much money 
you have for a down payment.
Your Credit Score and Credit History
Your borrowing and spending habits don’t take place in a vacuum. Three 
major U.S. credit bureaus—equifax, experian, and TransUnion—track how 
you manage your credit. Financial institutions and other businesses rely on 
these companies to evaluate you as a borrower by looking at how much 
credit you have available, how much you owe, and how responsible you 
are about paying on time.
a credit report is an overview of your credit history, which documents how 
much money you’ve borrowed in the past and how good you are at repay-
ing it. It also lists late payments, any bills referred to collection agencies, and 
any bankruptcies you declared. Your credit history is also the basis for your 
credit score, a number that rates your credit-worthiness based on past be-
havior and current debt. The higher your score, the more lenders see you 
as someone who’s likely to repay their loan. No matter which bureau issues 
your credit report, it contains both your credit history and credit score.

Chapter 2

Each credit bureau calculates credit scores differently, but the best-known 
and most widely used algorithm is the FICO method, devised by the Fair 
Isaac Corporation (a company founded by Bill Fair and Earl Isaac in 1956 
and now known as FICO). FICO scores range from 300 to 850, and higher 
is better. Your FICO score gives you a quick snapshot of how lenders view 
you as a potential borrower.
What goes into your FICO score
Credit agencies figure your FICO score using several factors, and they as-
sign each a particular “weight” in the final score (see the pie chart below). 
This section shows you what FICO takes into account. 
Your payment 
history: 35%
Money you 
owe: 30%
Length of your 
credit history: 15%
Types of credit you use: 10%
Your new credit: 10%
Your payment history
Understandably, the most important factor in determining your credit wor-
thiness is your reputation for paying back the money you’ve borrowed—it 
accounts for 35 percent of your FICO score and takes the following into 
account:
•	 Payment history for the different kinds of accounts you have. Pay-
ing at least the minimum amount and paying it on time works in your 
favor in these categories. These accounts may include the following:
Your FICO score may differ among the three credit bureaus. That’s because each 
has its own database, gets information from different creditors, and receives that 
information from creditors at different times. For this reason, it’s a good idea to 
check your credit report from all three bureaus before you apply for a mortgage so 
you can catch and address any major discrepancies. The box on page 45 tells you 
how to get a free copy of your credit report.

—
— Credit cards you get from banks, such as Visa, MasterCard, and 
American Express. 
—
— Credit cards you have with retail stores like Macy’s or Sears.
—
— Installment loans, where you pay off a balance in regular incre-
ments, such as a car loans or a  student loan.
—
— Consumer finance loans, which are subprime loans given out by 
companies that aren’t banks. Consumer finance companies don’t 
accept deposits, and they provide loans (usually at higher interest 
rates) directly to consumers who don’t qualify for bank loans.
—
— Existing mortgages (if any).
•	 Delinquencies. Missing payments for any of your accounts lowers 
your score. Your FICO score reflects: 
—
— How much is past due.
—
— How long any delinquent accounts have been past due.
—
— How many past-due accounts you have.
•	 How recently you’ve had delinquencies. If you ran into a rough 
patch in the past and couldn’t meet your payments, you need to show 
that you’ve resolved the problem and have stayed current on your 
payments since then.
•	 Adverse public records. FICO scoring looks for signs of legal troubles, 
including bankruptcies, foreclosures, any judgments against you, liens, 
lawsuits, wage attachments, and so on. On the plus side, the score 
takes into account how much time has passed since the infraction, the 
amount of money involved, and how well you’ve met your financial 
obligations since then.
•	 Collection items. If a creditor sends your past-due account to a collec-
tion agency, it’s a mark against you. Again, if this happened in the past, 
your score improves if your payments stay current since then.
Too many consumer finance loans is a red flag that can lower your overall score, 
though paying them back responsibly over time can raise your score.
Bankruptcy filings stay on your credit history for 7 to 10 years, depending on the 
type of bankruptcy you declare.

Length of your credit history
The longer you successfully manage debt, the better a loan prospect 
you are; the length of your credit history counts for 10 percent of your 
credit score. You won’t necessarily be penalized if you’re new to the credit 
game—you can still get a high FICO score if these factors look good:
•	 How long you’ve had credit. Your score reflects how long you’ve had 
your oldest account and the average age of all your accounts.
•	 How long you’ve had specific kinds of credit. Showing that you can 
handle different kinds of credit over time—for example, a student loan 
plus a credit card or two—improves your score.
•	 How much time has passed since an account was active. A credit 
card account that’s been inactive for a while carries less weight than 
a card you’ve used recently, even if you had the inactive card longer. 
Your new credit
“New credit” comprises accounts you opened or loans you took out re-
cently. From a lender’s perspective, opening a lot of accounts over a short 
period of time is a red flag, so this kind of activity can lower your credit 
score. The new credit component of your FICO score weighs these factors:
•	 How many new accounts you have. If your wallet is bursting with 
lots of shiny new credit cards, you haven’t yet proved that you can 
use those cards responsibly. This part of your score considers both the 
number of new accounts you have and the percentage of your overall 
credit history those new accounts represent.
•	 How many times your credit report has been requested in the past 
year. When you apply for credit and a financial institution requests 
your credit report, that request becomes part of your credit history. 
A large number of such requests in the recent past suggests that you 
may be getting ready to ramp up your debt—a warning sign that your 
score reflects.
Smart consumers shop for the best rate when they look for a loan—and that can 
mean that multiple lenders request your credit report within a short time, even 
though you’re planning to take out only one loan. FICO deals with rate shopping 
two ways. First, it treats all credit report requests within a two-week period as a 
single request, no matter how many lenders request your report. Second, FICO 
ignores all report requests made in the 30-day period before it calculates your 
score. That means report requests won’t affect your score as you look for the  
best rate.

Chapter 2
44
•	 How much time has passed since you opened an account. FICO 
breaks this information down by type of account (revolving credit, in-
stallment loan, and so on).
•	 How much time has passed since a financial institution last re-
quested your credit report. You don’t want to look as though you’ve 
been turned down for credit or applied for credit on a whim, so the 
longer the interval between credit applications, the better. This part 
of your score takes into account only those requests you made in the 
past year.
•	 Whether you’ve corrected past problems. If you’ve run into trouble 
with past-due accounts or had other credit-related problems, you’re 
not doomed to a low credit score forever. By managing your credit re-
sponsibly and paying on time, you can rebuild your creditworthiness 
and improve your FICO score. Raising a low score takes time, effort, 
and careful attention to managing your money, but you can do it.
Types of credit you use
The type of credit you have (bank credit cards, store cards, installment 
loans, mortgages, and consumer finance accounts), how many accounts 
of each type you have, and recent information about those accounts make 
up 10 percent of your score. 
What your FICO score doesn’t include
By now, you may feel like FICO shines a searchlight into every corner of 
your life. But there is information FICO doesn’t factor into your credit score:
•	 Your race, religion, national origin, sex, or marital status. The 
federal government doesn’t allow any credit bureau to factor this 
information into a credit score.
•	 Whether you receive public assistance. If you get help from the 
government to make ends meet, such as food stamps or housing 
assistance, credit companies can’t factor that information into your 
score; the federal government prohibits it.
•	 Your age. 
•	 Your salary, occupation, title, employer, date employed, or em-
ployment history. 
•	 Where you live. 
•	 The interest rate charged on a particular account.
•	 Child/family support obligations.

Up to Speed
Getting Your Free Credit Reports
The Fair Credit Reporting Act of 2003 entitles you to one free copy of your credit 
report each year from each of the three big credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian, and 
TransUnion. Get a copy of yours at least six months before you plan to apply for a 
mortgage so you can check for errors or other problems and take steps to correct 
them before you apply (see page 48 to learn how to do that).
There are three ways to request a copy of your credit report:
•	 Online. Visit www.annualcreditreport.com and fill out the online form. Note that 
this site is the only authorized website for getting your free credit report. Oth-
ers (try Googling “free credit report” and see how many hits you get) will try to 
sell you a service or collect confidential personal information—don’t fall for it. 
•	 By phone. Call 1-877-322-8228 to order your free credit report by phone, and 
you’ll receive a copy in the mail.
•	 By mail. Fill out the official Annual Credit Report Request Form and mail it to 
Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281. 
You can download and print out the form from the FTC’s website: Go to www.
ftc.gov and click Consumer Information, then select Credit & Loans, choose Your 
Rights: Credit Reporting, and click the Annual Credit Report Request Form link. 
(For a more direct route to the Annual Credit Report Form link, go to http://
tinyurl.com/43e6mo.)
The big advantage of requesting your credit report online is that you get the report 
immediately. Phone and mail requests take up to 15 days to process, so you may 
have to wait two or three weeks for your report.
Whichever method you use, you need to provide your name, address, Social Secu-
rity number, and date of birth. In addition, if you moved in the last two years, you’ll 
have to give your previous address. If you’re ordering online or by phone, for secu-
rity reasons you may be asked for a piece of information that only you would know, 
like your most recent payment to a credit card or utility account, so have your bills, 
checkbook, or bank statement handy.
Whether you request your free report from each bureau simultaneously or spread 
them out over time depends on why you’re checking your score. If you want to 
compare reports to look for discrepancies, order all three at once. If, on the other 
hand, you want to see how your score changes over time without having to pay 
for additional reports, spread out your requests over a few months. (Just keep in 
mind that there are likely to be variations in the scores produced by the different 
bureaus.)

Chapter 2

•	 Rental agreements.
•	 Certain kinds of requests for your credit report. Not all requests for 
your credit report get factored into your score. These are exempt:
—
— Requests made by you to check your credit report.
—
— Requests from employers or potential employers.
—
— Promotional inquiries. You know those offers for preapproved 
credit cards that show up in the mail? You didn’t apply for that 
credit—a lender was hoping you’d be tempted to apply. 
—
— Administrative inquiries. Sometimes a lender with which you al-
ready have an account will request your credit report while review-
ing your account.
•	 Any information that’s not found in your credit report. FICO scores 
information that’s present in your credit report. It doesn’t collect any 
information beyond what’s in the report.
•	 Any information that is not proven to predict future credit per-
formance. An example is your income. Although people with higher 
incomes may be better able to pay back debt, income alone is not 
a good predictor of whether you’ll pay back a loan according to the 
credit terms you agree to.
•	 Whether you’re getting credit counseling. The mere fact that you’re 
getting credit counseling to better manage your debt cannot affect 
your FICO score. Be aware, though, that the situation that caused you 
to seek credit counseling (such as late payments or defaults) and ac-
tions that you take as a result of credit counseling can both affect your 
score.
How Lenders Use Your FICO Score
Your FICO score is just one little number but, as the previous section de-
tails, a lot goes into that number. Lenders take your FICO score into ac-
count along with numerous other factors—your income, savings, credit 
history, and all that other information they ask for on the application (page 
208). But the score alone is a good indicator of how creditworthy you ap-
pear to potential lenders. The following table shows score ranges, along 
with their associated ratings and what they mean for you.

While a difference of 1.6 percentage points may not sound like much, 
those points make a huge difference over time. The table below shows 
how much it would cost you to pay back a $200,000 loan over 30 years at 
the APRs associated with each FICO score range. Over the life of the loan, 
that 1.6 percent difference will cost you more than $70,000.

Improve Your Chances of Getting  
a Loan
Before you apply for a mortgage, improve your chances of approval by 
putting your financial house in order. 
•	 Improve your FICO score. If you’ve got a blot on your credit histo-
ry that’s pulling down your score—or if you just want to bump up a 
“good” score to a “very good” or “excellent” rating—take steps to im-
prove your score well before you apply for a loan. Because your FICO 
score reflects your behavior as a borrower over time, it can take months 
or even years for a score to improve. Follow these tips to move up the 
FICO scale:
—
— Pay your bills on time. If you tend to forget exactly when each bill 
is due, set up automatic withdrawals to make sure payments get 
made when they should.
—
— If you’re behind in your payments, get caught up as soon as 
possible—and then pay on time. The longer you keep your ac-
counts current, the more your score improves.
—
— Reduce your credit card balances. High balances on revolving 
accounts pull down your score. If you’re carrying a high balance on 
one or more cards, pay down the amount you owe.
—
— Reestablish a good payment record. If you’ve run into trouble 
with credit accounts in the past, open a new account and be me-
ticulous about using it responsibly—don’t borrow too much and 
be strict about making payments on time. It takes time to rebuild 
good credit, so be aware that it may take years for your score to 
recover.
•	 Don’t quit your job. Lenders look for income stability. If you’re a job-
hopper, or if you leave a job shortly before you apply for a mortgage, 
you may look like a higher risk than if you’ve been employed consis-
tently for the last several years.
Here’s a compelling reason to check your score. In a 2004 study, U.S. PIRG (the 
national federation of state-level Public Interest Research Groups) found that 79 
percent of credit reports contained at least one error, ranging from minor mistakes 
in personal data (such as a misspelled name) to serious errors that, if uncorrected, 
could lead to being turned down for a loan.

How Much Home Can You Afford?

•	 Reduce your overall debt. As page 36 explains, lenders don’t like to-
tal monthly debt that exceeds 36 percent of your gross monthly in-
come. If you carry a lot of debt, the bank will scale back the amount 
of money it’s willing to lend you. Reducing your debt makes you look 
like a better risk, and the debt won’t squeeze your monthly PITI too far 
below its 28 percent ceiling.
•	 Spend small. The flip side of reducing your debt is making sure you 
don’t increase it. For at least six months before you apply for a loan, 
avoid buying big-ticket items, such as a new car or a washer/dryer set 
or anything else you need to buy on credit.
•	 Boost your down payment. As you’ll see in Chapter 6, lenders like 
to see hefty down payments, because the greater the investment 
you make out of your own pocket, the less likely you are to default. 
If you can put down more than 20 percent toward the purchase of 
your home, you’ll find it easier to get a loan than with a lower down 
payment.
•	 Don’t apply for a lot of new credit. As page 43 explains, lenders look 
at how long you’ve maintained your accounts and want to see respon-
sible repayment over time. Opening a lot of new accounts at once may 
make you look desperate for some quick cash. It also affects your debt-
to-income ratio (page 36).
•	 Don’t cancel existing credit cards. Lenders are interested in how 
much money you currently owe in relation to the credit you have avail-
able. This is called the credit-utilization ratio. Say you’ve got three credit 
cards, each with a $10,000 credit limit. That means you’ve got $30,000 
in available credit. If you have a $7,000 balance on one of those cards, 
a $2,000 balance on the second, and a zero balance on the third, you’re 
using 30 percent of your available credit. But if you cancel the zero-
balance card, your available credit drops to $20,000, which makes your 
credit-utilization ratio soar to 45 percent. Using a higher percentage of 
your available credit makes you look riskier to lenders.

efore you head to the grocery store, you probably make a shopping 
list of all the items you want. That helps you stay focused, limits im-
pulse buys, and ensures you don’t forget to pick up milk, eggs, or 
the necessary ingredients for Friday’s dinner party.
You need to be similarly prepared when you shop for a house. After all, 
you can’t run back to the store to pick up another bedroom, and you can’t 
return your house for a refund if you find it doesn’t fit your lifestyle. 
This chapter helps you figure out what you want in a new home. You start 
by looking at how you live now and how your lifestyle might change over 
the next several years. Then you’ll consider the housing options available 
and what you want in a neighborhood. From there, you’ll create a wish 
list and prioritize it. Then, as you begin touring homes, you’ll have a clear 
sense of what you’re looking for.

Your Lifestyle—Now and Down the 
Road
How do you live? Do you thrive on the energy of a city—the restaurants, 
culture, shopping, and nightlife? Or do you prefer the peace and privacy of 
a country home? Do you have (or are you planning to have) kids who need 
room to play, friends down the block, and good schools? Do you have ani-
mals to care for or hobbies (like woodworking or restoring cars) to accom-
modate? Are you an avid gardener, or would you rather have someone else 
do the yard work? 
Take out a piece of paper and note the things you like best about where 
and how you live now, along with the things that drive you nuts. The for-
mer are aspects of your current home that fit with your lifestyle that you’ll 
want to add to your wish list (see page 77). The latter are just as important 
negatives that you want to add to your “don’t want” list later in this chapter 
(see page 78).
Once you do that, think about your long-term plans. On average, home-
owners stay in their homes for five to seven years. How you live today is 
likely to change during that time. If you’re single, will you marry and have 
kids? If you have kids now, will they be leaving home in a few years? Think-
ing about how your life may change helps you choose a home that accom-
modates those changes.
Your Style of Home
When you’re in the market for a new home, you face a bewildering variety 
of choices. There are single-family houses in a huge variety of styles; you 
need to know the difference between a condo, a townhouse, and a co-op. 
And what do “stick-built,” “manufactured,” and “modular” mean?
This section describes your choices in the style of your home, explaining the 
look, types of ownership possible, and advantages and disadvantages of each.
Single-Family House
Close your eyes for a moment and conjure up your idea of the word home. 
If you picture a house with a yard surrounded by a white picket fence, 
two-car garage, garden, and swing set, you’re probably in the market for 
a single-family house. This freestanding structure (no neighbors over your 
head or on the other side of a wall) sits on its own piece of land (called a 
lot). For many buyers, the emphasis in single-family homes is on family: It’s 
the place you raise your family, from furnishing the nursery to celebrating 
holidays and birthdays to taking prom photos in front of the rose trellis.

53
Single-family homes come in many styles. Here are some popular ones:
•	 A-frame. A two-story house 
that gets its name from the 
steep-sloped roof that gives 
the building a triangular 
shape, making it look like the 
letter A. The roof plunges from 
a peak almost to the ground. 
A-frames frequently have 
many large windows and are 
popular vacation homes  
(think ski resorts).
•	 Bungalow. Bungalow comes from the Indian word bangalo, which 
means “in the Bengal style.” In India, a bungalow is a single-story 
thatched or tiled house surrounded by a wide veranda. In the U.S., 
bungalow refers to a small house of one or one-and-a-half stories, of-
ten without a basement. 
In urban areas, you may see single-family homes referred to as detached 
(standalone homes), semi-detached (side-by-side homes that share one internal 
wall), or row houses (townhouse homes like those described on page 61).
A-frame
As you shop for a home, you’ll encounter many architectural terms, some of which 
may be unfamiliar to you. Page 112 defines common architectural terms.

•	 Cape Cod. As its name im-
plies, this house style originat-
ed in New England, but you’ll 
find it throughout the country 
today. A Cape is a wood-
framed house with a square 
or rectangular footprint, with 
one-and-a-half stories and 
a steep, sloping roof. Capes 
often have a central chimney 
and, sometimes, dormer win-
dows to let in light upstairs. A Cape’s exterior is often finished with 
clapboard siding or shingles.
•	 Craftsman. This architectural style, popular during the first three decades 
of the 20th century, reflects the American Arts and Crafts movement, 
which emphasized handcrafted, rather than mass-produced, goods. 
Craftsman homes feature low-pitched rooflines with overhanging eaves 
and often have a front porch with square columns supporting its roof.
•	 Colonial. In general, this term refers to early American architecture 
from the British colonial period. Colonials are two-story, rectangular 
houses built of wood or brick, with a pitched roof. Colonial encom-
passes several distinct styles, often influenced by the colonizers of a 
particular region:
—
— Dutch colonial. This 
style has one-and-a-half 
or two stories and a 
gambrel roof (the style 
of roof you find on a 
barn), often with dormer 
windows.

—
— French colonial. You find this style in parts of North America that 
were originally colonized by the French, including Louisiana, the 
Mississippi River valley, and parts of the Caribbean. Porches are 
central to the design, as are low-pitched roofs that flare at the ends 
and cover the porch.
—
— Garrison colonial. The second story of a garrison colonial juts out 
slightly over the first.
—
— Georgian. With a rect-
angular footprint, these 
symmetrical homes usual-
ly feature three or five tall 
windows across the up-
per story’s front, a center 
door, a pitched roof with 
little or no overhang, and 
a central chimney (or one 
at each end of the house). 
Georgians are often made of brick or have clapboard siding.
—
— Saltbox. This type of home has two stories in front and, thanks to a 
steeply sloping back roof, one story in the back. Saltboxes get their 
name from their resemblance to the containers early Americans 
used to store salt.
—
— Spanish colonial. Popular in the south and southwest, Spanish 
colonial-style homes feature stucco walls; a low-pitched, ceramic 
tile roof; arched windows and doorways; and wrought-iron details.

•	 Prairie style. This design, best expressed in the architecture of Frank 
Lloyd Wright, features strong horizontal lines, including rows of small, 
high windows and a low-pitched, overhanging roof. Inside, an open 
floor plan makes the house great for entertaining. 
•	 Pueblo revival. Inspired by Native American pueblos and Spanish 
missions, this style has thick walls with rounded corners (made of 
adobe or stucco), flat roofs, and projecting wooden beams. If the 
home has more than one story, it’s often terraced. Homes in this style 
are popular in the southwest.
•	 Ranch. For those who don’t like to trudge up and down stairs, the popu-
lar single-story home comes in endless incarnations. Ranches often 
have low-pitched roofs, a basement, and a garage. A raised ranch builds 
up the foundation so that the basement is only partially underground, 
giving this traditionally one-story style two floors of living space.

•	 Split level. Split-level 
houses have three floors 
(they’re sometimes called 
tri-level houses). A single-
story section of the house 
is attached to a two-story 
section, with the floor of 
the single-story part about 
halfway between the lower 
and upper floors of the two-story section. Two small sets of stairs 
connect the sections. In the one-story section, you’ll usually find the 
kitchen, living room, and dining room. The two-story section often 
holds a family room, den, or master bedroom downstairs and addi-
tional bedrooms upstairs.
•	 Tudor. This style evokes the buildings of 16th-century England, with 
decorative half-timbering, steeply pitched roofs, dormers, and tall, nar-
row windows (which often have small or diamond-shaped panes). 
A shotgun house is a kind of ranch house that flourished in the southern U.S. from 
the end of the Civil War to the early 20th century. Shotgun houses are narrow (just 
10 or 12 feet wide) and without hallways; one room opens onto the next. They 
got their name because this straight-through arrangement let you fire a shotgun 
through the front door and the bullet would fly out the back door.

•	 Victorian. This term refers to both an historical period (the mid- to late 
19th century) and an architectural style that continues to thrive today. 
Victorians encompass a range of styles, including these:
—
— Italianate. Tall houses with two, three, or even four stories and 
sometimes a cupola perched on a flat or low-pitched roof. Itali-
anates may have arched windows and doors, and decorated brack-
ets support the roof’s overhang (which is why some people refer 
to this as the bracketed style).
—
— Mansard. Mansard homes have a distinctive roof that slopes on all 
four sides, often with rounded dormer windows.  
—
— Queen Anne. The most ornate Victorian style, Queen Anne houses 
feature an asymmetrical shape, often with a tower or turret and 
features such as bay windows and gingerbread trim. The roofline is 
steep and complex. Porches often wrap around the house.
If you’re looking for privacy and space, you probably want a single-family 
home. The whole building is yours, and this kind of home usually has a 
yard, giving you outdoor living space as well.
The main disadvantage of single-family homes is the time and money it 
costs to maintain an entire building—inside and out—as well as the land 
it sits on (page 21). If you’ve never owned a single-family home, you can 
easily underestimate how much repairs and routine maintenance affect 
your wallet and your free time.

Duplex
A duplex is a two-unit building—think of it as two homes for the price of 
one. The units may be side-by-side, with each having its own front door, or 
they may be upstairs-downstairs, with one unit stacked on top of the other 
(in that case, a single front door may serve as a common entrance). Some 
duplexes are purpose-built, designed to be two connected homes. Others 
are converted from large single-family homes.
Buying a duplex comes with a significant financial advantage: You can live 
in one unit and rent out the other to help pay your mortgage. But renting 
part of the building can bring problems, too, such as loud music in the 
middle of the night or a broken lease if a tenant suddenly moves out. Also, 
when you own a duplex, you’re responsible for the maintenance of both 
units and the building’s grounds, so take those costs into account.
Duplex
In some parts of the U.S., you may see homes described as “halfplexes.” A halfplex 
looks just like a side-by-side duplex, but there’s an important difference: Although 
a duplex has two units, it’s a single piece of property that sits on one parcel of land 
and is covered by one deed. A halfplex is two separate pieces of property—each 
side is deeded separately. If you buy a halfplex, you buy a single unit in a two-unit 
building, including the land your unit sits on. This style of home is more like a 
townhouse (page 61) than a duplex.

Condominium
Condominiums—condos for short—are apartment-like homes in a multi-
unit building. Unlike apartments, which are owned by a landlord who rents 
them to tenants, condos belong to the people who live there. When you 
buy a condo, you own your individual unit—you pay property taxes on it, 
and you earn equity over time. As a condo owner, you also own a share 
of the development’s common areas: hallways, walkways, parking lots, el-
evators, and perhaps amenities like a club house. To keep these common 
areas in good shape, you pay dues to a condo association, which arranges 
for maintenance and repairs.
On the plus side, owning a condo lets you build equity in your home and 
frees you from much of the responsibility for maintenance: You never 
have to mow a lawn, weed a flower bed, shovel snow, or paint the exte-
rior. In many condo developments, you enjoy amenities—tennis courts or 
a swimming pool, for example—that you might not otherwise be able to 
afford. And many condo owners appreciate the sense of safety and com-
munity that comes with living in a shared building. Condos are often less 
expensive than single-family houses, which make them attractive as starter 
homes.
But condos come with caveats, too. If you’re looking for privacy, a condo 
in a multi-unit building may not be your best choice. In addition, condos 
tend to gain value more slowly than single-family homes (which slows the 
growth of your equity) and, when housing prices slump, condo prices drop 
faster than those of single-family homes. If disaster strikes and the build-
ing needs urgent or unexpected maintenance, your condo association will 
levy a special fee to pay for it. Finally, if you want to renovate your condo, 
you have to get approval from the condo association board before you can 
start work.
A loft, a type of condo, is a residential unit in a building that wasn’t originally 
intended to provide housing, such as a converted warehouse or factory. Lofts 
have wide-open interior spaces and a trendy urban or industrial feel. Loft 
conversions are often part of urban revitalization projects, and they’re popular 
with professionals who work downtown and prefer an urban lifestyle to a long 
commute from the suburbs.

61
Townhouse
Townhouses sit in an uninterrupted row of houses, with their side walls 
connected to neighboring houses. They may be single-story buildings, 
but they’re usually tall, narrow units of two or more stories. Each unit has 
its own entrance, and some may have a garage on the ground floor. You 
can find townhouses in cities, where they may line a city block, and in the 
suburbs, where they’re usually part of a planned development. When you 
buy a townhouse, you usually gain title to an individual unit and the land 
beneath it. If the townhouse sits in a suburban development (as opposed 
to urban townhouses), the homeowners jointly own common areas, such 
as parking lots and public walkways. 
Townhouses combine the benefits of single-family homes with those of a 
condo: They offer privacy (no one walks over your head, though you do 
have neighbors on the other side of the wall), and they’re usually less ex-
pensive than single-family homes. Townhouses often require less mainte-
nance than single-family homes as well. Urban townhouses don’t have a 
yard to maintain, and the developer usually maintains the grounds of sub-
urban townhouse developments. As with a condo, you pay taxes on your 
individual unit and a monthly or annual fee to the development’s home-
owners’ association (page 23), which takes care of maintaining common 
areas and the building’s exterior. 
Co-operative Apartment (Co-op)
On the surface, a co-op looks just like a condo: It’s an individual residence 
in a multi-unit building. The difference is in the ownership structure. A co-
op building is owned by a cooperative corporation—think of it as a com-
pany set up for the sole purpose of owning the building. Instead of buying 
a piece of physical real estate in the building, you buy shares in the cor-
poration. With your share comes the exclusive right to live in a particular 
unit. Co-op owners pay fees to the corporation, and its board deals with 
Townhouses

Chapter 3
62
day-to-day maintenance and management issues. The corporation pays 
the mortgage and property taxes on the building as a whole and includes 
your share in your co-op fees. Co-ops are prevalent in some large cities, 
such as New York (where about 85 percent of the apartments available for 
sale are co-ops) and Chicago.
Co-ops offer many of the same benefits as condos: shared amenities, free-
dom from maintenance, a feeling of safety, and a sense of community. You 
can deduct part of your monthly co-op fees from your income tax (the 
part you pay for property tax), and the value of your shares may increase 
over time as property values increase, just as with any other home. Co-op 
boards screen prospective shareholders carefully and often have stringent 
requirements for who qualifies as a shareholder, checking your employ-
ment, income, finances, credit history, and even personal background. This 
screening process gives residents a say in who their neighbors will be.
That same stringency can be an obstacle when you try to buy into a co-
op, however. The application process can be time-consuming, may feel 
intrusive, and requires a lot of paperwork. And keep in mind that a highly 
selective co-op board can make it difficult to sell your shares and move on. 
Because many co-ops have strict rules about subletting your unit—or may 
even prohibit the practice altogether—this can be a real hardship later if 
you need to move.
Co-ops tend to have higher monthly fees than condos, because those fees 
include payments the corporation makes toward mortgage and taxes. And 
be aware that you may find it more difficult to obtain financing to pur-
chase co-op shares: The corporation may deal only with certain banks and/
or require a higher down payment than you need for a condo or single-
family home. 
Modular and Manufactured Homes
A home built piece-by-piece on the lot where it sits, from digging the foun-
dation to nailing down the last shingle, is called a site-built or a stick-built 
home. But that’s not the only way to construct a new home. Some homes 
are prebuilt in a factory and then shipped to the new owner’s lot. There are 
two kinds of prebuilt homes: modular and manufactured. (See the table 
at the end of this section for the differences between these home types.)
Modular homes
Modular homes are made in sections in a factory and trucked to your lot, 
where a crane lifts the pieces from the truck bed and sets them on the 
foundation. Local contractors then assemble the pieces and do the finish-
ing work, like hooking up the electricity and plumbing. So these homes 

Choose Your Style of Home and Neighborhood 
63
are built partly in a factory and partly on site. You have to have a perma-
nent foundation in place on your lot, just as with a stick-built home, and 
modulars are subject to local and state building codes—a local building 
inspector checks each new home to make sure it’s up to code. Once the 
work is done, it’s hard to tell that a modular began life as a group of factory-
built sections.
Modular homes come in an eye-popping variety of styles and sizes, from 
simple ranches to a spacious and elegant two-story colonials and Victo-
rians. You can choose a standard model or work with a manufacturer to 
create a customized home. 
If you’re interested in building a brand-new home, going modular may 
be a good choice for a couple of reasons. First, manufacturers and con-
tractors can fabricate, assemble, and finish a modular home faster than 
they can a stick-built home. And it may cost less to buy and assemble a 
modular—building costs per square foot are often lower than for tradi-
tionally built homes, although that depends on the price of materials 
and labor in your area.
When it comes to financing, lenders treat modular homes just as they do 
stick-built houses, and existing modulars tend to grow in value at the same 
rate as other homes in the neighborhood, no matter the original construc-
tion technique.
Manufactured homes
A manufactured home is built entirely in a factory. Manufacturers build 
each home (or segment of a home) on a permanent steel chassis, and the 
home travels to its site on its own wheels. You can have a manufactured 
home attached to a foundation, but it’s not required.
Another distinction of manufactured homes: Local building codes don’t 
apply. Instead, manufactured homes must conform to the federal gov-
ernment’s Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards code, 
called the HUD code. You can read about these standards at http://tinyurl.
com/yj7pxna.
Manufactured homes are usually less expensive than other housing op-
tions, and you can trade in an existing one toward a newer model, just like 
you would trade in a car. Also like a car, you can buy this kind of home by 
getting a loan directly from the retailer, which you pay back in monthly 
installments.

Chapter 3
64
Manufactured homes were built with mobility in mind (that’s why they 
used to be called mobile homes), so when you move, you can take your 
home with you. Well, maybe. If you decide to move your manufactured 
home, keep these tips in mind:
•	 Manufactured homes are built to specifications that depend on the 
destination climate and other factors; a home built for the desert may 
not hold up well in frigid northern conditions or humid tropical cli-
mates. Check with the manufacturer to make sure that your model can 
withstand the weather at your new locale.
•	 Moving a manufactured home can be tricky. For the smoothest move, 
hire a transport company that specializes in hauling manufactured 
homes. Of course, this can be expensive, depending on the distance 
and the hauling company.
If you’re considering a manufactured home, be aware of the downsides, 
too:
•	 You can’t just buy a piece of land and plunk down a manufactured 
home. Many towns have zoning regulations that limit where manu-
factured homes can go. Before you buy, check local zoning laws, the 
property’s deed restrictions, and neighborhood or development cov-
enants. A real estate lawyer can help you with this.
•	 Most lenders won’t finance a manufactured home unless you attach 
it to a permanent foundation (the home is their collateral, and they 
don’t want it disappearing the middle of the night). If you don’t want 
to anchor your home, you’ll probably have to arrange financing with 
the home’s retailer—and rates may be higher than for a mortgage.
•	 Manufactured homes aren’t considered permanent structures, and 
this affects their long-term value. Over time, these homes are more 
likely than traditional and modular homes to decrease in value. So 
don’t buy a manufactured home if equity is a priority.
Manufactured homes are eligible for FHA-insured loans (page 180) and VA loans 
(page 183).

Gains value over time, like a 
stick-built home.
Tends to lose value with age, like 
a motor vehicle.
Financing
Considered the same as a 
stick-built home for the pur-
pose of getting a mortgage. 
Often considered personal prop-
erty (not real property). Many 
lenders require a manufactured 
home to be attached to a perma-
nent foundation before accepting 
it as collateral for a loan. Dealers, 
rather than banks, often provide 
financing.
The Condition of Your Home
Besides the type of home you want, you need to think about its condi-
tion. Do you want to be the first person ever to sleep under its roof, or 
would you rather live in a house with history? Newer homes have modern 
central systems (heating, cooling, plumbing) and appliances, and they’re 
more energy efficient. Older homes often exhibit character and charming 
period details. A newly built house comes with a warranty (page 281) that 
protects you if certain repairs become necessary, but you might be able 
to save some money by buying a fixer-upper, rolling up your sleeves, and 
getting to work. 
Read the fine print on your home warranty. Warranties sometimes offer less 
coverage than you might expect.

New Construction
You can pick out a home design and have it built for you, either on your 
own lot or in a subdivision that’s being developed. Building your home 
from scratch gets you involved in every phase of its construction: choosing 
a floor plan, watching the walls go up, checking the finishing touches. A 
home built for you will conform to up-to-the-minute building codes and 
can incorporate modern, energy-efficient materials that reduce your heat-
ing and cooling costs. 
On the other hand, a new home may be more expensive than an existing 
one (as much as 10 percent more, according to the National Association of 
Realtors), and the construction process may take six months to a year. So 
be prepared to pay for a place to live at the same time you’re paying for the 
home’s construction.
Hire a builder
You’ve spent hours poring over books filled with house plans to find a de-
sign that’s perfect for you. You’ve bought the blueprints and found the lot 
where your new home will stand. Now all you have to do is hire a contrac-
tor, and your dream will become a reality. Right? 
Not so fast. Hiring a builder can give you the home of your dreams, but if 
you’re not careful, it can also be an experience beset with frustration and 
unforeseen expenses. If you decide to have a contractor build your new 
home, don’t rush. Make sure you hire the best person for the job by follow-
ing these tips:
•	 Make sure the contractor is legit. Before you hire a contractor, ask to 
see his or her license. You want to make sure that he has a current, valid 
license for your state. Also, ask for proof of liability insurance, which 
covers injuries and property damage during construction. 
•	 Check references. Ask the contractor for the names of previous cli-
ents. Call them and ask about their experience with the contractor 
and how they feel about the final product. If you can, visit a few of the 
homes.
•	 Compare bids. Interview at least three contractors so you can com-
pare their estimates. 
•	 Get everything in writing. Make sure that contractors’ estimates spell 
out everything you want in your home. If you want a fireplace, for ex-
ample, make sure it appears in the estimate.

67
•	 Read the final contract carefully. Make sure that the document ac-
curately describes your project and that you understand all its terms. If 
in doubt, show it to a real estate lawyer.
•	 Expect delays. A contractor’s best estimate of how long it will take 
to build your new home may not match up with reality. All kinds of 
factors, including weather and availability of materials, can delay con-
struction. If possible, be flexible about your move-in date so you’re not 
putting your belongings in storage and living in a motel as you wait for 
your house to be finished.
Buy in a development that’s under construction
In a new subdivision, the developer often begins by building one or more 
model homes for prospective buyers to tour. If you see a model you like, 
select an available lot and have the home built on it. When you buy a home 
this way, you get to choose your home’s kitchen cabinets, paint colors, and 
carpets, and perhaps tweak the home’s design to customize it. You also 
get a brand-new home with a warranty, so you can be confident that the 
home’s major systems and appliances will work the way they’re supposed 
to (or they’ll be replaced).
On the flip side, when you buy a yet-to-be-built home, be aware of poten-
tial problems: 
•	 When you base your decision on a model home, what you see is not 
necessarily what you get. Corner-cutting may leave you dissatisfied if 
the home doesn’t match up to the model. 
•	 New developments often have a cookie-cutter feel, with homes built from 
a limited number of designs. If individual style is important, you may be 
unhappy as identical houses spring up in your new neighborhood.
After a developer has sold all or most of the homes in a subdivision, the model 
home often goes up for sale. Buying a former model home can be a great deal—
you may be able to get a fully loaded showplace for less money than comparable 
homes in the neighborhood. Models have also seen a lot of traffic, though, thanks 
to home shoppers traipsing through them for months or years. If you’re thinking of 
buying a model home, ask whether the builder will do paint touch-ups and clean 
or replace carpets before you move in. Also check to make sure that appliances 
and systems are still under warranty—and for how much longer the warranty will 
be valid.

Chapter 3
68
•	 Don’t assume that the developer’s agent, who works out of the sub-
division’s sales office, has your best interest at heart—no matter how 
charming or persuasive he may be, he represents the developer. Hire a 
buyer’s agent (page 81) to represent your interests. 
•	 Don’t automatically apply for a loan through the developer’s lender. 
You may feel some pressure to work with the developer’s preferred 
lender to finance your purchase—but shop around before you decide. 
If the preferred lender offers you the best terms, great. But don’t agree 
to not-so-great terms simply because you think you’ll curry favor with 
the developer. Chapter 7 tells you how to choose the best mortgage.  
•	 Developers’ highest profit margins come from upgrades, so don’t get 
carried away with options only to watch the cost of your new home 
soar. Double-check upgrade costs before you order them, and keep 
track of how much you’re spending.
•	 Your move-in date may be pushed back by construction delays. 
•	 A brand-new development isn’t yet an established neighborhood. 
Streets may feel bare without mature trees, and you can’t get a sense 
of your new neighbors if their homes aren’t built yet. 
•	 Occasionally, a developer can’t sell enough homes in a planned sub-
division to make the project worthwhile. The developer may cancel 
the development—or even declare bankruptcy—leaving your dream 
home unbuilt. 
Ask the developer what kinds of trees he’s planted in the development. To green 
the neighborhood, developers often plant fast-growing trees like poplars. These 
look nice, but because they grow so fast they can develop weak root systems for 
their heights, creating a danger that they’ll fall over in a storm.
If a developer cancels a development or goes bankrupt, you could wait for months 
or years to get your deposit back—or even lose it. Before you hand over a deposit 
for new construction, make sure that the developer holds deposit money in 
escrow in a separate trust account. That protects your investment if the developer 
runs into financial trouble.

Preowned Homes
A lived-in home may be in move-in condition—thoroughly cleaned, dings 
in the walls filled in, paint touched up—or it may be a fixer-upper that 
requires significant work before you can move in (read the next section 
for more about buying a home that needs repairs or updating). Or it may 
fall somewhere in between, needing cosmetic work like new paint in the 
dining room or new carpet in the dining room before you’re ready to call 
it home.
Newer homes, those built within the past 5 or 10 years, offer many of the 
perks of a brand-new home. Although these homes have been lived in, 
they’re still likely to be up to modern standards of construction, materi-
als, and energy efficiency. Newer homes may not feel as outdated in their 
interior design as older homes, and their floor plans and storage space are 
more likely to reflect the way people live now.
“Older homes” encompass everything from centuries-old structures to 
homes built a decade or two ago. These homes tend to be in established 
neighborhoods with settled neighbors, mature trees, and established 
zoning (municipal planners are unlikely to allow a factory in a residential 
neighborhood, for example). Older homes have a reputation for solid con-
struction. Although new homes must pass an inspection, some modern 
construction techniques are more concerned with the bottom line than 
with quality craftsmanship. Older homes’ yards may be larger if land was 
cheaper when the home was built. Finally, older homes can be appealing 
for their character, including period details like wide-board floors, hand-
hewn beams, stained-glass windows, or detailed woodwork that would be 
prohibitively expensive in a newly built home. 
Older homes come with their own potential problems, so if you consider 
an older home, keep these tips in mind:
•	 A thorough home inspection is an absolute must. When you tour 
an existing home, it’s easy to focus on cosmetics—you love the pale-
blue bedroom walls, but that shag carpet in the family room has to 
go—and overlook problems with the structure itself. An experienced 
home inspector will find potential problems before you buy. (Chapter 
12 tells you what a home inspector looks for.)
•	 An older home may require more maintenance. With time, roof 
shingles loosen, concrete walks crack, window frames rot. If the house 
feels drafty, you may need to add insulation. Many houses built in 
the 1980s through the early ’90s have polybutylene pipes (page 297), 
which can deteriorate with time and may leak.

Chapter 3
70
•	 There may be lurking health hazards. Lead pipes, lead paint, and as-
bestos insulation are a few materials that used to be common in home 
construction but are now known to be unsafe. Your home inspector 
will look for hazardous materials (page 306) and let you know if they 
require remediation.
•	 Appliances may be older and less energy efficient. Ask about the 
age of appliances. Appliances have an average lifespan of 10 to 15 
years, so be aware of when you might have to replace the dishwasher 
or fridge. Older appliances also tend to be less energy efficient than 
newer models—a difference that may show up in your utility bills.
•	 Updating can be expensive. You don’t want to be held captive to 
the previous owner’s taste, but the cost of updating a home’s look can 
add up fast. Figure out the cosmetic changes you want and budget 
for them—or be prepared to live in the home as is for a while. And 
optional cosmetic updates are only part of the story: Systems or appli-
ances may require updating to function properly. Your home inspector 
(Chapter 12) will let you know. 
•	 You may get fewer square feet for your money. For the past 60 
years, the size of the average American home has steadily increased 
from 980 square feet in 1950 to a peak of just over 2,600 square feet in 
2008. Buying an older home may mean settling for smaller rooms and 
less closet space than you’d get if you bought new.
•	 Watch out for tree damage. Tall, mature trees cast inviting shade and 
look pretty, but they may also cause problems. Trees planted too close 
to a house, for example, can damage the roof, the foundation, or any 
underground pipes.
Fixer-Uppers
Whether it’s called a fixer-upper, handyman’s special, or a home in need of 
some elbow grease or a little TLC, this is an existing home that probably 
needs some work before you can move in. Buying a fixer-upper can be a 
good deal for these reasons:
•	 In a desirable neighborhood, a fixer-upper may be priced less than 
homes of similar size. Spending the time and money to renovate the 
home can give its value a huge boost, bringing it in line with those 
higher-priced homes.
•	 If you like historic homes, you can restore a poorly decorated or re-
modeled house to its original glory.

Choose Your Style of Home and Neighborhood 
71
•	 Do-it-yourselfers get a sense of accomplishment and increase their 
pride of ownership when they fix up a rundown home.
•	 You don’t have to live with someone else’s decorating or design choices. 
A fixer-upper can be a blank canvas on which you create your vision of 
the good life.
Although the price discount and the potential to increase the home’s value 
make fixer-uppers seem like a great deal, renovating a home isn’t easy—
and it isn’t for everyone. Before you roll up your sleeves and open your 
toolbox, think long and hard about these questions:
•	 Is the fixer-upper as good a deal as it seems? It can be easy for your 
eyes to fill up with dollar signs as you contemplate the difference be-
tween the house’s current price and its value once renovated. Don’t 
guess; do the math. Talk to a real estate and find out how much similar 
homes in the neighborhood have recently sold for—that’s your target 
value. Then, subtract the expected cost of renovations. Don’t guess 
here, either; talk to contractors to get a firm idea. (Of course, the ex-
pected cost of renovations may not match the actual cost, so to be 
on the safe side, increase the estimate by 5 or 10 percent.) The home’s 
expected value minus the adjusted renovation estimate is the break-
even number, the maximum amount you should offer for the home.
•	 How extensive are the required renovations? To make sure you 
know what you’re getting into, have the home thoroughly inspected 
(Chapter 12). If the property has serious structural problems—such as 
a crumbling foundation, significant dry rot, outdated wiring, or obso-
lete plumbing—the required repairs may be more than you should 
take on.   
•	 Where will you live during the renovation? Staying in your current 
home or temporary housing while you renovate can be expensive—
remember, you’re making payments on your new mortgage, paying 
for a place to live in the meantime, and racking up materials charges 
for the renovation. On the other hand, living in a home that’s undergo-
ing renovations can be a noisy, dusty, uncomfortable affair.
Modern living uses a lot of electricity—for computers, appliances, air conditioning, 
and more—and an older home’s electrical system may not be able to handle 
the load. Old electrical systems may also be a fire hazard. If you think the home’s 
electrical system may need a substantial upgrade, get an electrician to inspect it 
and estimate how much the upgrade would cost.

Chapter 3
72
•	 How long will renovations take? Fixing up a place almost always 
takes longer than you think. Contractors may be delayed by other proj-
ects or simply fail to show up on the appointed date. If you’re renovat-
ing the home yourself, be realistic in estimating how much time and 
energy you have to devote to the project. “I’ll work on it evenings and 
weekends” may sound like a plan, but do you really want to spend ev-
ery waking moment you’re away from your job working on the house?
•	 Are you prepared to keep a close eye on contractors? The fixer-
upper will be your house, so it’s your job to make sure that the people 
you hire to renovate it do what they’re supposed to and keep the proj-
ect within budget.
•	 What if the renovations go over budget? Many things can drive a 
renovation’s actual cost higher than the contractor’s estimate: delays, 
increased costs of materials and labor, unforeseen problems uncov-
ered during the work, and more. Leave some wiggle room in your bud-
get for cost overruns.
Find Your Neighborhood 
The building where you’ll eat and sleep, kick back in the evenings, and 
wake up in the mornings is only part of what makes a home. The rest? Lo-
cation, location, location. Choose your new neighborhood as carefully as 
you choose your new home. This section helps you find a neighborhood 
where you’ll feel at home.
Schools
If you have kids (or plan to), local schools are a major consideration. Take 
some time to talk to school administrators, teachers, and local parents to 
find out more about the schools in the neighborhood you’re considering. 
Attend a public parent-teacher association or school board meeting. 
A visit to www.education.com/schoolfinder is a good first step in checking out local 
schools. Enter a school district or zip code, and you get information about local 
schools, including demographics, standardized test results, and reviews.

Choose Your Style of Home and Neighborhood 
73
Here are some of the things you want to know about local schools:
•	 What grades do the schools cover?
•	 How many children attend the school?
•	 What’s the average class size?
•	 What are the average scores on standardized tests?
•	 How does the school rank compared to others in the state?
•	 Are there any areas in which the school has received a “needs improve-
ment” rating from the state? 
•	 What does the school’s music and art curricula include?
•	 What sports programs are available?
•	 What other after-school activities are available?
•	 What efforts does the school make to promote diversity?
•	 Are there problems with cliques or bullying?
If you’ve got high-school students in the family, ask these questions, too:
•	 What’s the student attrition rate (that is, what percentage of students 
drop out)?
•	 What percentage of graduating seniors attend college?
•	 What is the school’s college counseling program like?
•	 What percentage of teachers have graduate degrees in their subjects?
•	 Are there honors courses? In what subjects?
•	 Does the school have a chapter of the National Honor Society?
•	 Are there AP courses? In what subjects?
•	 How many students win state or national awards?
•	 What clubs and extracurricular activities are available to students?
•	 What team sports does the school offer?
•	 What levels of sports are available (varsity, junior varsity, intramural)?
•	 Does the school have any problems with gangs or vandalism?
Even if you don’t have school-age children, it’s a good idea to evaluate a potential 
home’s school district. You may not care whether the local schools are any good, 
but if you decide later to sell the home prospective buyers might. Remember that 
the quality of its school district affects a home’s value.

Services and Shopping
Some people prefer to live in a quiet, residential area devoted to homes. 
Others want to be within walking distance of services they use frequently. 
Consider how close you want to be to services such as these:
•	 Schools
•	 Post office
•	 Grocery store
•	 Malls
•	 Other shopping
•	 Dry cleaner
•	 Dentist
•	 Physician
•	 Hospital
•	 Veterinarian
Amenities
Amenities make life pleasant and enhance your sense of community. De-
cide how important it is to you to have easy access to:
•	 Parks
•	 Playgrounds
•	 Museums
•	 Places of worship
•	 Restaurants and cafes
•	 Music venues
•	 Performance theaters
•	 Cinemas
•	 Sports venues
•	 Hiking and biking trails
•	 Swimming pool or beach
•	 Skating rink
Make a list of the amenities most important to you and use it as you evalu-
ate potential homes.

Neighbors
More than any other factor, people define a neighborhood. Your neighbors 
create a sense of community; they’re the people you chat with across the 
fence, invite over for coffee, and sit with at kids’ soccer games. When you 
buy a house, expect to interact with your new neighbors for a long time. 
Making and nurturing friendships is one of the joys of owning a home—
and having neighbors you don’t get along with can be one of its curses.
You want to live in a neighborhood where their lifestyles complement 
yours. If you have young children, for example, you probably want to be 
near schools and other families who have kids of a similar age. If your work 
schedule mandates an “early to bed, early to rise” regimen, you want a 
neighborhood that’s quiet at night. If, on the other hand, you like to party 
until dawn, that quiet neighborhood may not be right for you. 
Go into the neighborhood. Talk to people who live there. Drive or walk 
around at different times of day. Notice when people are out and about. 
Look for signs that neighbors share your interests—lush gardens, nice 
lawns, kids’ play sets, and so on. Spending time in a neighborhood is the 
best way to get a feel for it. 
Commuting
How much time, at most, are you willing to spend traveling to and from 
work each day? How far is the neighborhood from your place of work? 
How will you get to work: using public transportation, walking, cycling, or 
driving? If you drive to work, does the route take you along highways or 
back streets? 
Many multi-unit developments (condos, townhouses, and co-ops) have both 
owners and renters as residents. If you’re considering buying in one of these 
developments, find out how many residents own their unit and how many rent. 
A high ratio of owners to renters indicates that your neighbors are likely to have 
pride of ownership in their residence, since they have a financial stake in it.
Travel the route between your prospective neighborhood and your workplace 
during the hours you’d routinely make the trip to get a sense of rush-hour traffic—
how busy are the roads, or how crowded are the buses and trains?

Chapter 3
76
Economic Stability
Because the average homeowner moves within seven years, you want to 
find a neighborhood that’s stable economically (or even better, one where 
home values are rising). Good economic stability will make it easier to sell 
your home quickly and make some money on the deal. Even if you plan to 
stay in your new home for many years, you should consider whether your 
new neighborhood is economically stable. Current home prices in your 
neighborhood affect the amount of equity you have in your home, so if 
values decline you may lose equity. Economic instability may lead to fore-
closures (glutting the market with unsold homes) and an increase in crime.
No one can predict the future. A major employer whose business is boom-
ing now may run into difficulty, laying off employees or closing altogether. 
Take a neighborhood’s economic pulse by asking these questions:
•	 Is the neighborhood close to a diversity of employers? A wide range 
of employers, large and small, within commuting distance indicates 
greater overall stability in a community. If area employment relies 
heavily on one business or industry, how stable does the outlook for 
that industry appear? 
•	 Are there a significant number of abandoned homes or empty storefronts?
•	 Is there a lot of graffiti?
•	 Do sidewalks and roads appear well maintained?
•	 Does the local news media feature stories about economic hard times? 
If you repeatedly come across stories about local businesses failing or 
unemployment increasing, this may be a risky time to buy.
Crime Rate
Nobody wants to move into a high-crime area, especially when you’re 
making a significant financial investment in a home. There are two kinds of 
crime you need to be aware of: violent crimes (murder, assault, rape, and 
robbery with threat of force) and property crimes (burglary, larceny, auto 
theft, and arson). Call or visit the local police station or check out its web-
site to review crime statistics. Read the local paper—you can subscribe or 
read it on the Internet—to see what kinds of crimes are reported and in 
which areas. 

Choose Your Style of Home and Neighborhood 
77
Zoning
You wouldn’t want to settle into your new home and find out a year or 
two later that a company is building a huge factory across the street. Mu-
nicipalities create zoning laws to minimize such problems; municipal plan-
ners divide a city or town into zones, each with restrictions on the kinds of 
buildings or uses within them. Examples of zones are residential, commer-
cial, industrial, and mixed-use (which allows a mixture of buildings from 
different zoning categories). To be sure that your neighborhood will be 
filled with neighbors, not businesses or factories, look in areas zoned for 
residential use. 
You can find out a prospective neighborhood’s zoning classification—and 
what kinds of buildings and uses are allowed there—by talking to a real 
estate agent or checking with city hall.
Create a Wish List
Now comes the fun part—putting together a list of everything you want 
in your dream home, from price range to style to amenities to your ideal 
neighborhood. The home you eventually buy may not meet all your crite-
ria, but touring homes for sale with a list in hand (page 137) gives you the 
best chance of finding a home you’ll love. 
The website Sperling’s Best Places breaks down a neighborhood’s demographics, 
including a quick, by-the-numbers glimpse of its crime rate. Go to www.bestplaces.
net and type a city, town, or zip code into the search box. Click Search, and then 
click the Crime link. The page that opens compares local incidences of violent 
crimes and property crimes with regional and national averages.
Ask your real estate agent whether the neighborhood you’re considering has any 
restrictive covenants in place. These are deed restrictions, usually put in place by 
the neighborhood’s original developer, that limit what you can do with the home 
or lot that you’re purchasing. Covenants may cover a wide range of issues, from 
specifying the number of stories a house can have or how far it must be set back 
from property lines to spelling out acceptable paint colors and fence heights. 
There may also be restrictions on home businesses and the kinds of vehicles you 
can park in the driveway.

To create a wish list, follow the three steps below. The Missing CD has sam-
ple lists you can use for each of these steps. To find them, go to the Missing 
Manuals home page (www.missingmanuals.com), click the Missing CD link, 
scroll down to Buying a Home: The Missing Manual, and then click the Miss-
ing CD link.
1.	 List what you want in a home. Include all the features you want in 
your dream home, including style; size; condition; number of bed-
rooms and bathrooms; features like a garage, family room, fireplace, 
or pool; and neighborhood amenities. Don’t worry about making your 
list too long; you’ll narrow it down in step 3.
2.	 Identify what you don’t want. Knowing the definite deal-breakers—
what you’re sure you don’t want in a home—can be just as helpful as 
knowing what you do want. Creating a “don’t want” list and sharing it 
with your agent will help your agent target your search better.
3.	 Prioritize your preferences. By the time you list everything you want 
(and don’t want) in a home, your wish list might look so long that you 
wonder whether your dream home really exists. So look at the lists 
you’ve created and prioritize the items on them. Knowing what’s most 
important to you, as well as what you could live without or add later, 
gives you an edge in evaluating homes.
Use your “don’t want” list to come up with more ideas of items to add to your wish 
list. For example, if you know for sure you don’t want an unpleasant view, think 
about the kind of view you would like—such as mountains or a lake.

A 
well-known African proverb says that it takes a village to raise a 
child. As a new homebuyer, you’ll need nearly as many people to 
buy a home. Purchasing a home is a huge investment with many 
variables. It’s an obstacle course you’ll find tough to navigate on your own. 
You need the expertise of professionals who protect your interests as they 
take you through the process of finding a home, making an offer, getting 
financing, and finalizing the sale. This chapter introduces you to the real 
estate professionals who’ll make up your home-buying team. For each of 
the main players—real estate agents, mortgage provider, attorney, and 
home inspector—you’ll get tips on how to find the right one.

Real Estate Agents
In your quest for a new home, the person you’ll interact with most is your 
real estate agent. She’s a lot more than a smiling face in the classifieds, 
hovering over pictures of homes for sale. She’s a licensed professional, au-
thorized to negotiate and carry out the sale of real property on behalf of 
a buyer, a seller—or sometimes both simultaneously. Read on to learn the 
different roles real estate agents play, how they make their money, and—
most importantly—how you find one who works well with you.
Agents and Brokers and Realtors
Every state and the District of Columbia require real estate agents to hold 
a license, but not all licenses are the same. Most states define two types 
of real estate professionals: broker and agent. But you may come across 
several other terms as well. Here’s the lowdown:
•	 Real estate broker. This is an experienced real estate professional 
who’s met state requirements to own, manage, or operate a real estate 
company. Licensing requirements usually include experience in the in-
dustry as a sales agent, advanced coursework, and passing an exam. (In 
some states, attorneys can become real estate brokers, even if they’ve 
never worked as real estate agents.) The broker in a real estate firm is 
its “boss,” the person who takes responsibility for all the agents who 
work there. Depending on where you live, you may hear real estate 
brokers referred to as principal brokers or qualifying brokers.
•	 Real estate agent. This is someone who’s taken classes and passed 
a state-administered exam to get a license to sell property. The edu-
cational requirements cover the specific state’s real estate laws and 
practices. Real estate agents are associated with a real estate broker 
and act under that broker’s authority. Depending on where you live, 
real estate agents may be called subagents, sales agents, real estate 
salespeople, or, confusingly, brokers. 
Some licensed brokers choose not to run their own firm but to work as agents for 
another broker in that broker’s firm. These people are called associate brokers.

As you look for a home, you’ll probably work primarily with a real es-
tate agent. Real estate agents can represent the seller of a house, the 
buyer of a house, or both:
—
— Seller’s agent. Also called a listing agent, this person works exclu-
sively for the seller. Most often, you’ll deal with the seller through 
the seller’s agent. Except in cases where you have a specific agree-
ment with an agent to represent you as a buyer (see the next item 
on this list), you should assume that any agent you work with is 
a seller’s agent. Even if an agent didn’t personally list the seller’s 
property, any agent involved in the sale of a property is considered 
a subagent of the listing agent—unless that agent has a contract 
to represent only you, the buyer (see “Buyers’ Agent” below).
—
— Buyer’s agent. A buyer’s agent works solely for you the buyer, and 
represents your interests throughout the real estate transaction, 
from initial house-hunting through closing the deal. Buyer’s agen-
cy is a formal agreement, signed by you and a particular real estate 
agent, saying that the agent represents you and your interests in 
buying a home. 
—
— Dual agent. This is a single agent who represents both the seller 
and the buyer in the same transaction. In most states, dual agency 
is legal so long as the agent gets the consent of both the buyer 
and the seller. But as the box on page 83 explains, dual agency can 
lead to conflicts of interest.
Agency means representation, and an agent is a representative. If you enter into 
an agency agreement with someone, it means that you’ve both agreed that that 
person will act as your representative.
In a transaction, the buyer’s agent is called, confusingly enough, the selling agent. 
To keep from being muddled by the terminology, think of agents’ roles this way: In 
transactions that have both a listing (seller’s) and a buyer’s agent, the listing agent 
puts a home on the market and represents the current owner; the selling agent 
facilitates the sale by representing the buyer who makes that sale possible.
Dual agency can also occur when two agents who work for the same broker repre-
sent both parties in a real estate transaction. The box on page 83 tells you more.

Frequently Asked Question
Real Estate Agent vs. Realtor
What’s the difference between a real estate agent and a Realtor?
REALTOR® is a registered trademark of the National Association of Realtors. Any real 
estate agent who claims this title must be a member in good standing of the NAR. 
To join the NAR, agents agree to abide by a code of ethics that includes honesty, 
putting clients’ interests ahead of their own, and disclosing all relevant facts about 
a property.
As a homebuyer, you should work with a buyer’s agent. You want to be 
sure that your interests are represented in negotiations and that your 
agent keeps your confidential information to herself. Later in this chapter, 
you’ll find out how to choose a good buyer’s agent.  
What a Real Estate Agent Does
Real estate agents are experts in local real estate: They monitor the market 
daily and look for housing trends (in prices, inventory, location, and so on). 
An agent tells you about available houses in your price range and takes 
you on tours of homes that interest you. Much of an agent’s day is taken 
up by phone calls, meetings, and home tours.
For sellers, a listing (seller’s) agent:
•	 Researches recent sales of comparable homes to help determine an 
asking price
•	 Helps sellers prepare their homes for sale 
•	 Lists the home with the Multiple Listing Service (known in the trade as 
the MLS, a searchable list of homes for sale within a particular region)
•	 Advertises the home through various channels, which may include the 
Internet, classified ads, real estate magazines, and on-site advertising 
(the latter usually comprising a “For Sale” sign on the lawn and take-
away information sheets about the home)
If a real estate agent fails to let you know that you’re in a dual agency situation—
that is, the agent represents both you and the seller or both your agent and the 
seller’s agent work for the same firm—you may be able to revoke the purchase 
agreement you signed and sue the agent for concealing the relationship.

Up to Speed
Dual Agency 
You’re just starting to look for a new home and haven’t yet selected a real estate 
agent. One weekend afternoon, you drive through the neighborhood where you 
want to live and see an Open House sign. You stop to take a look. Inside, everything 
is perfect. The house has the right number of bedrooms and bathrooms, the kitch-
en is a cook’s dream, and the place is in move-in condition. “I love it!” you tell the 
smiling real estate agent who’s hosting the open house. “I want to make an offer.” 
“Great!” she replies. “Let’s write up the paperwork.”
She looks nice. She’s friendly and helpful. She’s eager to help you buy the home. But 
there’s just one problem. She’s already representing someone: the seller.
Real estate agents have a fiduciary duty to their clients. That means that a real es-
tate agent—whether a seller’s or a buyer’s agent—is legally bound to represent 
your best interests in any transaction. But when you start negotiating with a seller’s 
agent, your best interests don’t always line up with theirs. Yes, you want to buy the 
house and the seller wants to sell it. But you want to buy the house for the low-
est price possible, and the seller wants to sell it for the highest price possible. See 
where the conflict comes in? In that situation, how can the same agent have the 
best interests of both of you at heart?
Most states allow dual agency, on the condition that the real estate agent tells both 
you and the seller that she’s representing you both—and all parties sign a docu-
ment agreeing to that. But before you agree to dual agency, think long and hard 
about whether you want the seller’s agent representing you, too. For example, you 
might tell your agent confidentially that you’ve been preapproved for a mortgage 
of up to $250,000, but you don’t want to bid more than $230,000 on a particular 
home. The agent knows that the seller wants to get at least $245,000 for that same 
home. Although a good agent always keeps your confidential information confi-
dential, it may be tempting in this situation to try to convince you to raise your offer.
Dual agency also comes into play when a home buyer and seller are represented by 
two different agents who work for the same broker. This kind of dual agency may 
be called designated agency, and if your state allows it, you’ll probably have to sign 
a statement saying you agree to have the same agency represent both you and the 
seller. Some agencies pay agents a bonus for selling in-house listings because the 
agency makes more money in such transactions—conflict of interest, anyone? If 
you want to buy a home that’s listed with your buyer’s agent’s brokerage, make sure 
that your interests come before the broker’s.

As a buyer, you can expect a real estate agent (either the seller’s agent or 
your own) to work with you in these ways:
•	 Listen to your priorities in looking for a home, including your price 
range
•	 Contact listing agents to check availability and schedule showings
•	 Show you suitable properties
•	 Notify you as new properties appear on the market
•	 Suggest sources of financing
•	 Help you write a purchase offer and present that offer to the seller
•	 Negotiate with the seller on your behalf
•	 Write a purchase-and-sale agreement (page 250)
•	 Set up and attend the home’s appraisal and inspection
•	 Review disclosure statements and let you know about problems with 
a property
•	 Deal with contingencies (page 251)
•	 Provide information to your mortgage officer, real estate attorney, and 
escrow officer
•	 Coordinate with other parties to schedule the closing
•	 Attend the closing
You’re not bound to work with any lender recommended by an agent. Page 197 
has tips for finding the best mortgage.
Agents know what to look for in disclosure statements and other documents. 
Although it’s important to find an agent you like, the most important quality an 
agent has to offer is his expertise.

How Real Estate Agents Get Paid
Real estate agents earn their money by commission: When a property sells, 
they get paid, usually 4 to 7 percent of the purchase price. If a property fails 
to sell, the agent doesn’t get paid—no matter how much time and money 
she’s invested in showing and advertising the home.
The seller usually pays the agent’s commission from the proceeds of the 
home’s sale. Of course, sellers are aware of this and take the commission into 
account when they determine their asking price and decide whether to ac-
cept an offer. If you use a buyer’s agent, he and the seller’s agent split the com-
mission (each side may get half, or the percentages may vary somewhat).
Here’s an example of how buyer’s and seller’s agents typically get paid. 
Suppose you buy a house for $250,000 and the seller pays a 6 percent 
commission. In this case, the commission works out to $15,000. The listing 
agent and your agent split that commission down the middle, each earn-
ing $7,500. Each will probably pay a percentage of the individual commis-
sion to his broker, up to 50 percent—in this example, that’s $3,750.
There are some things a real estate can’t tell you by law. If you have questions 
about a neighborhood’s character, diversity, crime rate, or schools, you have to 
look elsewhere for the answers. Federal fair housing laws prevent real estate 
agents from “steering” clients toward one neighborhood or away from another 
one. The idea behind the law was to prevent discrimination—to prevent real estate 
agents from deciding whether a client is a good or bad fit for a particular neigh-
borhood. Despite the law’s good intentions, it can be frustrating to have basic 
demographic questions go unanswered. Chapter 3 suggests ways to find those 
answers.
The commission split between agent and broker varies depending on the agent’s 
experience. For a new agent without much of a track record, the split may be 50/50 
with the broker (his boss), while an experienced agent who generates lots of busi-
ness can get a much sweeter deal, keeping 70 to 80 percent of the commission.

Chapter 4
86
Sounds like easy money, doesn’t it? Well…keep in mind that agents do 
a lot of work behind the scenes. On average, for each hour your agent 
spends with you, she’s putting in a full, eight-hour workday doing tasks 
you don’t see: making phone calls, checking listings, screening homes, 
setting up tours, filling out paperwork, coordinating with others on your 
team, and more.
Some buyer’s agents charge their clients a retainer, which may or may not be 
refunded if the agent fails to help you buy a home. Page 87 tells you more about 
working with buyer’s agents.
Frequently Asked Question
Going It Alone
I think real estate commissions are too high. How much money would I save by skip-
ping the agent and buying a home by myself?
The short answer: Not as much as you might think. Remember that commissions 
are based on an agreement between the seller and the listing agent. If you don’t 
bring in an agent to work on your behalf, the listing agent simply keeps the whole 
commission.
If you’re interested in a home that’s for sale by owner (FSBO, pronounced fizz-bo)—
a situation in which the seller forgoes an agent and handles all the details of the 
sale—you might be tempted to do without an agent, too. When the seller doesn’t 
offer a commission, you have to pay your agent out of your own pocket. If no agent 
is involved on either side, there’s no commission to pay. You could save thousands 
of dollars.
But for most buyers—especially new buyers—this isn’t a good idea. Look over the 
list on page 84 of what an agent does for you. Negotiating, setting up appoint-
ments, writing documents, opening an escrow account—all this requires knowl-
edge and a major time commitment. And you may not have the legal expertise to 
understand the documents related to your purchase. You can get assistance with 
that from your real estate attorney—and you’ll definitely need an attorney if you 
don’t work with an agent. Remember, though, that attorneys charge you for each 
and every hour (or part of an hour) they work. So relying on a real estate attorney 
to help you with paperwork that an agent customarily takes care of may end up 
costing you quite a few bucks.
If you’re a new buyer, the best route is to go with an experienced buyer’s agent.

Working with a Buyer’s Agent
The whole point of working with a real estate agent is to have a knowledge-
able professional represent your interests throughout the home-buying 
process, from identifying possible homes to closing the deal. So you want 
to find an agent who has your best interest at heart. 
The concept of a buyer’s agent arose because of concerns about conflicts 
of interest between buyers and the agents. In the past, a real estate agent 
always represented the seller—whether the agent had listed the house 
himself or was simply showing it to buyers, he worked on the seller’s be-
half. So a buyer could go to an agent, explain what he was looking for and 
how much he was willing to pay, and grow to trust that agent. But the 
agent had no obligation to fulfill that trust. In fact, as a subagent of the 
seller, he was legally bound to give the seller any information that was in 
the seller’s best interest to know. So if a buyer said, “Let’s ask for a $5,000 
credit to pay for roof repairs, but I’ll buy the house even if the seller doesn’t 
go for it,” the agent would have to let the seller know that the sale didn’t 
hinge on granting that credit. No one protected the buyer’s interests.
By the mid-1990s, the idea of a buyer’s agent was in place, and most states 
had disclosure laws that required real estate agents to tell you whom they 
represent: the seller, the buyer, or both. When you agree to work with an 
agent, the agent must clarify your relationship, spelling out her responsi-
bilities toward you. In some states, a conversation is sufficient; others re-
quire a written statement (as the next section explains).
Your buyer’s agent may represent you in one of several ways:
•	 Buyer’s agent—single agency. In this role, the agent works for a bro-
kerage that represents both buyers and sellers. However, this agent 
represents only you, the buyer, as you shop for and purchase a home.
•	 Buyer’s agent—dual agency. Dual agency happens when a single 
agent represents both the buyer and the seller (for example, when you 
call a home’s listing agent to see a house and decide to work with that 
agent) or when the buyer’s agent and the seller’s agent both work for 
the same broker. The box on page 83 goes over some of the conflicts 
of interests that may arise in a dual agency.
•	 Exclusive buyer’s agent (EBA). This kind of agent works for a real es-
tate agency that represents only buyers. The agency doesn’t list prop-
erties, so the agents who work there never represent a seller. If you 
work with an exclusive buyer’s agent, you may have to pay an up-front 
retainer—and you may not get a refund if the agent fails to find you a 
home.

Chapter 4
88
As page 85 explains, buyer’s agents usually get paid a commission, split-
ting the fee with the listing agent. But buyer’s agents can be paid in other 
ways, so make sure you know how your agent earns his money. Here are 
some of the ways buyer’s agents may get paid:
•	 A percentage of the purchase price. This is the most common method.
•	 A percentage of the purchase price and a bonus based on the dif-
ference between the listing price and the purchase price. In other 
words, the agent gets a bonus if she negotiates a sale price below the 
asking price. For example, you might give your agent a bonus of $100 
for every $1,000 below the asking price you buy the home, up to what-
ever maximum you’re willing to pay. This gives the agent an incentive 
to bargain hard on your behalf.
•	 A flat hourly fee.
•	 An hourly fee plus an up-front retainer.
•	 An hourly fee with a specified minimum number of hours.
Although your buyer’s agent has a fiduciary duty to represent your inter-
ests in a transaction, the commission system comes with a built-in con-
flict of interest: The more you pay for a home, the more money the agent 
makes. So some unscrupulous buyer’s agents may steer a buyer toward 
certain listings or advise you to overbid.
A good buyer’s agent puts your interests first because it’s the law. But 
smart buyer’s agents also realize that a satisfied client (and the good word 
of mouth that comes with it) is more important than a few hundred bucks. 
An extra $10,000 in the purchase price puts between $150 and $300 in the 
agent’s pocket. Ethical agents realize that a client’s trust in them has value 
far beyond that.
Commissions and fees are always negotiable. Don’t be afraid to ask for a lower 
commission or a lower hourly fee.
Fiduciary duty means a legal responsibility to act in the best interests of another 
party.

Signing with a Buyer’s Agent
To formalize your relationship when you hire a buyer’s agent, you’ll most 
likely sign a buyer’s agency or buyer’s brokerage agreement. (In some 
states, agency can be based on a verbal agreement, but it’s always a good 
idea to get it in writing.) This agreement specifies that the buyer’s agent 
works for you and spells out each party’s responsibilities. 
There are countless variations on buyer’s agency agreements depending 
on where you live and the policies and practices of the agency you choose, 
but a typical agreement addresses these issues:
•	 Your relationship with the agent. This may be exclusive or nonexclusive:
An exclusive buyer’s agency agreement specifies that you’ll work only 
with this agent to look for a home.
A nonexclusive buyer’s agency agreement places no limit on the num-
ber of agents you can work with, but it usually specifies that you can’t 
use one agent to buy a house another agent showed you first.
•	 The term of the agreement. This may cover a period of days from 
the date of signing or specify an end date. If the agent helps you buy 
a house within that time frame, the agreement ends when you close 
on the house.
•	 The geographic area of the agreement. If you’re looking for a pri-
mary home in the city and a weekend home three hours away , the 
same agent probably can’t help you. So this section lists the counties 
covered by the agreement. 
•	 The types of property covered by the agreement. This typically says 
that the agreement covers any residential property you might buy, 
whether listed with an agency or by an owner (see page 121).
Look for agents who’ve earned the Certified Exclusive Buyer Agent (CEBA) or 
Accredited Buyer Representative (ABR) designation. These certifications, respec-
tively administered by the National Association of Exclusive Buyer Agents and the 
National Association of Realtors, show that the agent has completed specialized 
training in buyer representation.

Chapter 4
90
•	 How the agent gets paid. As page 88 shows, buyer’s agents can get 
paid in a variety of ways. This section spells out the compensation 
model. For example, you might agree to pay a certain amount toward 
the agent’s fee if the commission received from the listing agent falls 
below a minimum threshold.
•	 Whether you’ll accept dual agency. Not all states allow dual agency be-
cause of potential conflicts of interest (as the box on page 83 explains). 
•	 Whether the agent is an exclusive buyer’s agent. EBAs (page 87) 
represent only buyers and will never represent a seller during the term 
of your agreement.
•	 The agent’s responsibilities toward you. This section describes what 
the agent will do for you: find suitable properties, negotiate on your 
behalf, uphold fiduciary duties to act in your best interests, respect 
confidentiality, and so on.
•	 How the agent will handle your earnest money. When you make an 
offer, you back up that offer with earnest money (page 250) to show 
you’re not just fooling around and wasting everyone’s time. The agent 
may hold onto your check until the seller accepts your offer; after that, 
the agent deposits the earnest money in an escrow account.
Don’t rely on a handshake to cement your relationship with a buyer’s 
agent. Get it in writing. And if you have any concerns about your relation-
ship with the agent that aren’t addressed in the agreement, bring them up. 
Working with the agent, you may be able to amend the agreement.
Finding an Agent You Can Work With
Don’t assume that you have to go house-hunting with the first real estate 
agent you talk to, whether that agent is a buyer’s or a seller’s agent. You’ll 
be working with your agent for weeks or months, so take the time to find a 
good partner in your search for a home. Talk to several agents and to their 
former clients before you choose your buyer’s agent. 
Interview agents
Employers wouldn’t dream of hiring a new employee without an inter-
view. When you choose an agent to work with, you effectively hire that 
agent. After you contact several agents, choose three who seem like good 
candidates. Sit down with each for a heart-to-heart. During the conversa-
tion, take notes and pay attention to body language.

Assemble Your Real Estate Team
91
Here are some questions to ask during the interview:
•	 Do you work as an agent full-time? If not, find out how much time 
the agent devotes to his real estate practice. You want an agent who’s 
available when you have a question or concern.
•	 How long have you been selling real estate? An experienced agent 
knows the local market and is both familiar and comfortable with the 
process of buying a home.
•	 How many homes did you help buyers purchase last year? Ask for 
a list of these homes, along with the listing price and purchase price.
•	 Do you represent both buyers and sellers? If the agent says yes, ask 
how she handles a dual agency.
•	 What’s your average list-price-to-purchase-price ratio? As a buy-
er, you want to find an agent with a good track record of negotiating 
deals. Look for a ratio that shows the agent has helped buyers pur-
chase homes for less than the asking price. For example, say the agent 
helped three clients buy houses that were all listed for $250,000: The 
first client paid $243,000 (97.2 percent of the list price), the second paid 
$248,500 (99.4 percent of the list price), and the third paid $241,900 
(96.7 percent of the list price). That agent would have a list-price-to-
purchase-price ratio of 97.7 percent, showing that, on average, his cli-
ents paid 97.7 percent of the sellers’ asking prices. When you compare 
two agents, a lower list-price-to-purchase-price ratio may indicate a 
better negotiator.     
•	 How will we communicate? Some agents will pick up the phone and 
call you when they see a listing you might like. Others will shoot you 
an email. Some contact clients frequently—possibly several times a 
day—others less so. Make sure the agent’s preferred communication 
style is compatible with your own.
•	 How many buyers and sellers do you represent right now? What 
you’re really asking here is whether the agent has sufficient time to 
devote to help finding you a home. A super-busy agent who’s going to 
four or five closings a week and hosting open houses every weekend 
may not.
•	 What’s your assessment of the current state of the local market? 
Find out whether the agent sees the current market as a buyer’s market, 
a seller’s market, or something in between—and how that will affect 
how she works with you. 

Chapter 4
92
•	 What’s your strategy for helping me find a home? Listen to what 
the agent says about how he hunts down homes that look like a good 
match. If you’re likely to be in stiff competition with other buyers, ask 
how the agent handles multiple offers on the same property.
•	 Do you have access to homes that are For Sale by Owner (FSBO)? 
Some homeowners decide to sell their homes themselves, without the 
assistance of a real estate agent (see page 86). If you’re interested in FS-
BOs, ask how the agent can help you find such homes. Ask, too, about 
how the agent gets paid when dealing with FSBOs.
•	 Will you help me find the other professionals I need to buy a 
home? Your agent can refer you to preferred lenders and title compa-
nies, home inspectors, and real estate attorneys. You don’t have to take 
any of these recommendations, but you might find it helpful to get 
suggestions of people who’ve worked well with the agent in the past.
•	 How do you find most of your clients? Look for an agent who does 
lots of business with repeat clients and referrals.
•	 Can you give me some references to contact? The section below dis-
cusses what to ask people who’ve worked with the agent in the past. 
You want to know about buyers’ experiences, so you don’t have to 
contact people who sold their homes with this agent.
•	 What happens if you don’t find me a home? If things don’t work out 
with this agent, you need to be able to cancel the agency contract and 
move on.
•	 What other question should I ask you? How the agent answers this 
question indicates what she thinks buyers in your area need to know.
Check references
After you interview agents, you may have a strong sense of which you’d like 
to work with. Before you sign a buyer’s brokerage agreement (page 89), 
though, call some buyers the agent has worked with in the past. Checking 
references can confirm your hunch—or send up a red flag. It can also serve 
as a tiebreaker if you’re having a tough time deciding between two agents.
If the agent is “affiliated” with other real estate professionals, ask whether the 
agent receives a referral fee when someone becomes a client of those profession-
als. Be wary of any recommendation in which the agent has a financial interest—
and perhaps of the agent who does business that way.

93
When you call references, be considerate. After all, the person is doing you 
a favor. Don’t call at an inconvenient time, like dinner hours or late at night. 
Introduce yourself, explain why you’re calling, and ask whether the person 
has a few minutes to talk to you (if you get “no” for an answer, ask if there’s 
a more convenient time when you can call back). Keep the phone call brief, 
but try not to hang up with a lot of unanswered questions.
Ask these questions to get a sense of how well the agent worked with pre-
vious buyers :
•	 Describe your overall experience working with the agent.
•	 Would you describe the agent as honest and trustworthy?
•	 Did the agent devote sufficient time to working with you? Was it ever 
difficult to arrange a showing or a meeting because the agent was too 
busy? Did the agent deliver offers and complete paperwork on time? 
•	 What did you like best about working with the agent?
•	 What did you find most frustrating about working with the agent?
•	 Would you work with this agent again?
•	 Looking back on your home-buying experience, do you think this 
agent helped you make the right choice?
Take notes during the conversation, and be sure to thank the person for 
her time before you end the call.
Make a decision and make it legal
After you speak to references, you have the information you need to 
choose an agent. Take these factors into account:
•	 Compatibility. Is the agent someone you’d enjoy working with? You’re 
not looking for a new best friend, but you’ll spend a lot of time with 
your agent as you tour homes, discuss strategy, fill out paperwork, and 
do the myriad other activities involved in buying a home. Your agent 
should be compatible with you in terms of personality, approach, and 
communication style.
•	 Understanding. It’s important that your agent “gets” what you’re look-
ing for in a home. Otherwise, you’ll both waste your time looking at 
properties that aren’t a good fit for you.

Chapter 4
94
•	 Availability. Look for an agent who’ll work with your schedule. You 
don’t want to find yourself missing opportunities because you can 
never find a common time to meet.
•	 Trustworthiness. Your agent has a fiduciary duty toward you; that 
means your relationship is based on trust and confidence. You need to 
work with someone you trust to deal with you fairly, to keep a lid on 
your confidential information, and to represent you with both honesty 
and honor.
Once you decide on an agent, sign a buyer’s agency agreement (page 89). 
A written, signed agreement clarifies the responsibilities of you and your 
agent both—so you can get on with the business of finding your dream 
home.
Helping Your Agent Help You
No matter how perfectly you can picture yourself in your future home, 
your agent isn’t a mind-reader. To get the most out of your relationship 
with your agent, share information about what you want for your new 
home. You know to cover the basics—price range, neighborhood, style of 
home—but think broadly, too. Here are some questions to get you started: 
•	 What are your plans for the future? You’re probably thinking ahead 
to the day you’ll move in to your new home. But living in a new home 
doesn’t end with the excitement of moving day. How is your life likely 
to change during the years you’ll be in the home? For example, you 
might start a family, send your last kid off to college, or have an aging 
parent move in. You might be planning to start a home business or go 
back to school. Look ahead 5 or 10 years, and then share that vision 
with your agent, who can help you find homes that have the potential 
to accommodate your plans.   
•	 How will you use the home? Maybe you need a home office or work-
shop. If you entertain frequently, you might want a house with a for-
mal dining room or an open floor plan. If you’re an avid gardener, you 
need space for your garden to grow. Think about the activities you’ll 
do in the home, and your agent can focus on homes that match your 
preferences.   
•	 What problems have you had in your past homes? If you can com-
plain for hours about the time you lived next door to a noisy nightclub 
or the drafty old barn where you shivered though an entire winter, 
your agent can help you avoid similar problems in the future.

Agents have tons of experience matching homebuyers with homes that 
suit their needs and their lifestyles. Your agent may be able to see the po-
tential—and potential problems—in homes that you might not. The more 
your agent knows about you, the better she can focus on finding homes 
that are a good fit.

Not all matches are made in heaven—and that goes for relationships be-
tween homebuyers and agents, too. If the thrill is gone and your agent isn’t

It may not be easy. Agents do a lot of up-front work for free—usually they 
don’t get paid until you close on a house. So they need to protect them-
selves from unscrupulous buyers who use up a lot of their time and then 
try to cut them out of a deal. You may have to request a clause in your 
agent agreement that lets you terminate your relationship with 48 hours’ 
notice. Make it clear that you want to work with the agent and expect to 
have a mutually rewarding relationship, but you need a termination clause 
in case things don’t work out. If the agent is unwilling to include such a 
clause, you might want to set up a trial period by limiting the term of the 
agreement to 30 or 60 days.
You should only fire your agent with good reason: if, for example, she 
doesn’t show you appropriate homes or return your phone calls or emails. 
Before you fire an agent, sit down and have a talk; you may be able to work 
things out. If that doesn’t happen, you have three choices:
•	 If your agency agreement has a termination clause, give notice that 
you’re ending the agreement. Don’t look at houses with the agent 
during the notification period. If you end up buying a home that you 
found while the agreement was still in effect, you may owe the fired 
agent her commission.
•	 If your agency agreement doesn’t have a termination clause, explain 
to the agent why you feel the agreement isn’t working out and that 
you want to end it. The agent may or may not agree.
•	 If the agent doesn’t agree to end your relationship, talk to the agent’s 
boss, the broker who manages the agency. If the broker won’t end the 
agreement, you have to wait for it to expire.
Don’t fire an agent and then buy a house that the agent already showed you. You 
could be setting yourself up for a lawsuit.

Your Mortgage Provider
Not many people have enough cash on hand to pay for a house. So an 
important member of your team is the mortgage provider who fronts 
the money that lets you buy the home. You may find financing through a 
mortgage broker or deal directly with a lender.
Working with a Mortgage Broker
Think of a mortgage broker as a matchmaker. But instead of helping peo-
ple find their soulmates, a broker matches homebuyers and lenders. If you 
choose a mortgage broker, you work directly with her, and she acts as an 
intermediary between you and the lender.
Mortgage brokers work for brokerage firms, and both federal and state laws 
regulate them; most states require these firms to be licensed. Many bro-
kers are members of the National Association of Mortgage Brokers (NAMB), 
which offers three levels of certification:
•	 General Mortgage Associate (GMA). This entry-level certification 
shows a threshold level of professional knowledge about the mort-
gage industry. To receive GMA certification, a broker must pass an 
exam, but no industry experience is required.
•	 Certified Residential Mortgage Specialist (CRMA). Brokers with this 
level of certification have at least two years’ experience under their 
belts. They must also pass an exam and earn at least 50 qualifying 
points, which are awarded for professional activities such as educa-
tion, getting other certifications, experience, and leadership.
•	 Certified Mortgage Consultant (CMC). This is the highest level of 
certification NAMB offers. It requires five years of experience in the in-
dustry, passing an advanced exam, and a minimum of 100 qualifying 
points for professional education and activities.
Here’s what you can expect a mortgage broker to do:
•	 Gather information about your finances, employment, and credit his-
tory (page 39) and assess your eligibility for a mortgage based on that 
information
•	 Identify loans from a variety of lenders that meet your needs
•	 Present those loans to you, along with a clear explanation of how they 
work and what the terms mean

Assemble Your Real Estate Team
97
•	 Help you get preapproved (page 34) for a mortgage
•	 Help you apply for a mortgage, from gathering documentation to fill-
ing out the paperwork
•	 Present your mortgage application to a lender
•	 Keep track of all the conditions you must meet before closing, acting 
as a liaison between you and the lender, home appraiser, surveyor, 
various insurers, and so on
•	 Facilitate the closing, making sure that all your documents are in order 
and that the lender transfers the funds
Mortgage brokers typically get paid 1 to 2 percent of the loan amount. 
They may collect money through direct fees (called processing, origina-
tion, or brokerage fees), a slightly higher interest rate on your loan, or a 
combination of the two. You pay the mortgage broker, so be aware that 
these fees are open to negotiation. A good mortgage broker should be 
able to match you up with a loan that pays her fees by finding a lower-cost 
loan that you could find yourself.
As with your real estate agent, talk with several mortgage brokers and 
check references before you agree to work with one. In fact, it’s even more 
important to check out potential mortgage brokers thoroughly—in most 
states (California is an exception), mortgage brokers have no fiduciary 
duty toward their clients. In plain English, that means the broker has no 
legal obligation to put your interests before his own. Good mortgage bro-
kers are ethical and do serve your best interests, but you don’t want to find 
yourself in a situation where greed makes a broker steer you toward a loan 
that’s not the best deal for you.
Before you agree to work with a mortgage broker, get the answers to these 
questions:
•	 Are you licensed (this is not required in all states) and/or do you 
belong to any professional associations, such as NAMB? Member-
ship in one of these associations suggests a level of professionalism 
and industry experience.
About a two-thirds of American homebuyers get their mortgage through a broker; 
the rest work directly with a lender.

Chapter 4
98
•	 How long have you worked as a mortgage broker? You want to 
work with a broker who’s successfully matched buyers and lenders for 
at least two years.
•	 Do you specialize in residential mortgages? For this question, “yes” 
is the answer you want to hear.
•	 How many residential mortgages have you brokered in the past 
year? Look for someone who’s successfully brokered 10 or more 
mortgages.
•	 I’d like to make sure the broker I work with has my best interests in 
mind. What kind of fiduciary duty do you feel you have to clients? 
Make sure the broker convinces you that she’s working on your behalf 
and not putting herself first. 
•	 Could you give me the names and contact information of three re-
cent clients to serve as references? If the broker can’t provide refer-
ences, move on.
Check references the same way you checked them for your real estate 
agent (page 92). Ask these questions:
•	 When did you work with the broker?
•	 Did she listen to your needs and concerns?
•	 How responsive was she? Did she answer your questions clearly and 
give you information in a timely manner?
•	 Did she present you with a variety of loan choices?
•	 Are you happy with the loan you chose?
•	 Did the broker help you throughout the process of getting a loan?
•	 What did you like about working with this broker?
•	 What frustrations did you experience in getting a mortgage?
•	 Would you choose this broker again if you were in the market for a 
loan?
Satisfied clients are a good indication that you’ve found a good broker.
Working with a Mortgage Lender
Some homebuyers prefer to work directly with a lender. You might want to 
deal with a local bank or credit union that has a thorough understanding 
of your area, or you might prefer to use the Internet to research the best 
rates yourself (page 197). If you go directly to a bank or other financial 
institution, you’ll deal with a loan officer. This person works with you just 

Assemble Your Real Estate Team
99
as a mortgage broker does, identifying appropriate loans, analyzing your 
financial information, and guiding you through the mortgage process 
from application through closing. Unlike a mortgage broker, who searches 
different lenders’ products to find you the best loans, a loan officer is em-
ployed by a particular lender. That means she’ll present only mortgages 
offered by that lender.
If you work directly with a mortgage lender, you probably won’t get to 
choose your loan officer the way you choose a mortgage broker. Because 
loan officers work for a particular financial institution, you’ll most likely get 
an appointment with whoever is available. Even so, if a friend or family 
member had a good experience working with a loan officer, see if you can 
set up an appointment with that person.
What about a loan officer’s fiduciary duty? The situation here is more 
clear-cut than when you work with a mortgage broker. A loan officer is 
an employee of a bank, credit union, or other financial institution. The 
lender—not you—pays the loan officer. So never forget that your loan 
officer, no matter how nice and friendly, is working for the lender.
Your Real Estate Attorney
Buying a home means scaling a small mountain of paperwork—over and 
over again, you have to sign your name on the bottom line. It’s essential to 
understand each and every piece of paper you sign. Your real estate agent 
and mortgage broker or loan officer can explain many of the contracts and 
forms involved in your transaction—but neither of these people is a law-
yer. It’s a good idea to have a qualified real estate attorney on your side to 
scrutinize the fine print, answer questions, and explain difficult concepts. 
Every state has its own real estate laws. In some, such as New York, a real 
estate attorney is a normal and expected part of the home-buying trans-
action: Only an attorney can prepare the home purchase documents, per-
form a title search, and close the deal. In other states, such as California, 
your agent will help you fill in the blanks on standard forms that have al-
ready been approved by the state bar association. An escrow officer (see 
Chapter 13) handles the closing, so you may not need an attorney. But 
even if your state doesn’t require an attorney, consider bringing one on 
board early in the process. If things go wrong, it’s better to have an attor-
ney who’s familiar with your situation than to rush around looking for one 
who might be able to salvage a deal. 

Chapter 4

What an attorney can do for you
If you’re a first-time buyer, a real estate attorney can give you peace of mind 
as you go through an unfamiliar and complex process. Here are some of 
the services a real estate attorney provides:
•	 Reviews the purchase agreement before you sign it and, if necessary, 
revises it. Or, if you already signed a purchase agreement and worry 
there’s a problem, an attorney can void a purchase contract if it vio-
lates your state’s laws.
•	 Reviews (or in some cases performs) a title search for the property, 
which confirms that the seller is its legal owner. (Page 268 tells you all 
about title searches.)
•	 Reviews all other legal documents related to the purchase, including 
the deed. If there are mistakes in the deed, such as misspelled names, 
the attorney can correct them.
•	 Prorates costs you split with the seller. For example, the seller may 
have prepaid a year’s worth of property taxes, and you have to reim-
burse her for that money from the date you take ownership.
•	 Coordinates among agents, your mortgage broker or loan officer, the 
lender’s attorney, and the seller’s attorney to make sure all documents 
are ready for the closing.
Even experienced homebuyers should consult an attorney in certain 
situations:
•	 For complex transactions. If legal issues arise and your real estate 
agent doesn’t know how to address them, you definitely need a real es-
tate attorney. For example, say the current owner converted his garage 
into a studio apartment that doesn’t have a certificate of occupancy; 
you want to know whether you can legally rent out the apartment. Or 
you want to buy a home with a partner who’s not a relative, or through 
a trust. If your situation doesn’t fit the language of standardized real 
estate forms, an attorney can get the wording right.
•	 When you don’t have a real estate agent. If you buying a FSBO home 
(page 86) directly from a seller, you definitely need an attorney to help 
you with the paperwork and make sure everything is legal.
•	 When your state requires it. As mentioned earlier, some states require 
an attorney to prepare certain documents related to the purchase of a 
home. Ask your real estate agent if that’s the case in your area.

Choose a real estate attorney
It’s important to pick an attorney with expertise in real estate law. A lawyer 
might be a whiz at tax or probate law or corporate mergers, but unless 
she has significant experience with residential real estate transactions, you 
don’t want to hire her for this job. So before you hire an attorney, ask these 
questions:
•	 How much experience do you have in residential real estate trans-
actions? Look for an attorney who has five or more years of experi-
ence. An attorney who specializes primarily in commercial or rental 
real estate may not be the best person to represent you in a home 
purchase.
•	 How many homebuyers have you represented in the past year? At 
least 10 shows that representing home buyers is a significant part of 
the attorney’s practice.
•	 How do you charge for your services? Some attorneys charge a flat 
fee for real estate transactions, others charge by the hour. Ask how 
much in attorney’s fees a typical home purchase costs. Fees may vary 
widely; for example, hourly fees may range from $150 to $350 for each 
hour of the attorney’s time.
•	 Have you ever been sued for malpractice or disciplined by a bar 
association? It’s in your interest to hire a competent attorney with a 
clean ethical slate.
•	 Will you provide me with a list of recent clients? Get at least three 
names.
References don’t mean much unless you check them. So talk to some of 
the attorney’s previous clients to get their opinions and their answers to 
these questions:
•	 How did you choose this attorney? Did someone recommend her or 
had you worked with her before?
•	 What services did she provide?
•	 Did she meet deadlines and return your phone calls and emails 
promptly?
Before you hire an attorney, check with your state’s disciplinary agency to make 
sure that the attorney hasn’t been in trouble for ethical or other violations. You 
can download a list of state disciplinary agencies, complete with addresses, phone 
numbers, and website information, from the American Bar Association at www.
abanet.org/cpr/regulation/directory.pdf.

•	 Did she explain concepts and answer your questions clearly?
•	 Were you satisfied with her work?
•	 Would you work with her again?
Your Home Inspector
In the movie The Money Pit, a young couple buys what looks like a beauti-
ful home at a bargain price—until the house starts to fall down around 
them. A home inspector makes sure you don’t meet the same fate.
When you tour a home, it’s easy to notice the cosmetics—you like the car-
pet in the living room, but the kitchen cabinets have got to go. But how do 
you know whether the home’s foundation is solid and the central systems 
(electrical, heating/cooling, plumbing) work the way they should? No mat-
ter how well-maintained a home appears, it can hide problems that re-
quire a trained eye to spot. 
A home inspector gives your prospective property a thorough going-over, 
from roof to foundation, checking the structure and its systems. Chapter 
12 shows you what a home inspector does, step by step. 
The purchase offer (page 249) your real estate agents writes up should in-
clude a contingency (page 251) that tells the seller the offer is valid only if 
you’re satisfied with the results of the home inspection. Typically, this con-
tingency gives you 17 days to withdraw your offer or move forward with 
your purchase: 14 days to conduct a home inspection and 3 days to make 
your decision. You should interview inspectors and choose the one you 
want to work with before you make an offer on a house. At busy times of 
the year or in areas where the real estate market is hot, you may find your 
preferred home inspector has a waiting list. So find an inspector and call 
her as soon as your offer is accepted.
As with the other real estate professionals on your team, you should inter-
view home inspectors before you choose one. Ask these questions:
•	 Are you a full-time home inspector? This isn’t a guarantee of com-
petence, but it shows that the inspector is in enough demand to make 
a living at it and suggests dedication to the job and (perhaps) better 
availability.
Some sellers have a home inspection done before they put their home on the 
market. Even in that case, you should still hire a home inspector to look over the 
property. The couple of hundred dollars you’ll spend is worth it to get a second 
opinion. 

Assemble Your Real Estate Team
103
•	 How long have you been inspecting homes professionally? You 
want an experienced home inspector, especially one who’s familiar 
with your area and the problems that commonly occur there. Look for 
one who’s been in the business for at least a couple of years.
•	 Do you have training in home inspections? Many home inspectors 
have a background in construction, but inspecting homes is a special-
ized discipline that requires specialized training. It’s a good sign if the 
inspector has taken classes in home inspection.
•	 Are you a member of any professional associations, and do you 
have any special certifications? Some of the professional associa-
tions for home inspectors are the American Society of Home Inspec-
tors (ASHI), the International Association of Certified Home Inspectors 
(InterNACHI), and the National Association of Home Inspectors (NAHI). 
Each of these organizations have standards of practice and a code of 
ethics that members must follow.
•	 Do you have up-to-date professional liability insurance? Some-
times called errors and omissions insurance, this policy covers the 
home inspector in case there’s a mistake or oversight in the inspection 
report. If things go wrong and you end up having to sue the inspector 
over a faulty report, this insurance means you’ll get paid if you win a 
judgment.
•	 What does your inspection cover? May I see a sample report? The 
inspector should assure you that your inspection meets state criteria 
(if applicable) and complies with the standards of practice and code 
of ethics of one of the major home inspectors’ associations. Look for a 
report that goes into a lot of detail instead of a quick checklist. (For an 
example of a good inspection report, check out page 302.)
•	 How many residential home inspections did you do in this area in 
the past year? Look for one to two per month at a minimum.
•	 How long does a typical inspection take? A thorough home inspec-
tion takes two to three hours for a single-family home. If the inspector 
whizzes through it in less time, he may miss problems.
•	 May I attend the inspection? If you’re on site during the inspection, 
you can ask questions and see potential problems for yourself. If the 
inspector doesn’t want you around, choose someone else.
•	 How quickly will I get the report after the inspection? Most inspec-
tors deliver a report within 24 hours. And find out how the inspector 
gets the report to you as well—via email, fax, or in print.

Chapter 4
104
•	 Can you give me the names and contact information of at least 
three references? Homeowners know for sure how thorough a 
home inspection was only after they move in. It’s a good idea to talk 
to previous clients to find out whether the inspector missed some-
thing important.
When you get a list of references, check them out (page 92 gives tips for 
checking references). Here are some questions to ask:
•	 When did you work with the home inspector?
•	 Did the inspector show up on time and deliver the completed report 
promptly?
•	 Did you accompany the inspector? If so, did he explain what he was 
doing and answer your questions?
•	 How much time did he spend going over the property?
•	 Was the home inspection report thorough, easy to understand, and 
supported with photos and/or documentation?
•	 Have any problems arisen that the inspector should have pointed out 
but didn’t?
•	 Would you choose this home inspector again?
Watch out for inspectors who rushed through the inspection or who 
missed issues that later turned into problems for the buyer.
Other Real Estate Professionals
By now you’ve met the main players. Here are some other professionals 
you might want on your home-buying team:
•	 Accountant. Your accountant or tax preparer can clue you in on the 
tax breaks associated with buying a home.
•	 Appraiser. Lenders need to know that a house is worth at least as 
much as you’re paying for it. An appraiser inspects the house and com-
pares it to similar properties in the area to determine its worth. 
Later, after you build some equity in your home, you may hire an appraiser when 
you apply to cancel private mortgage insurance (page 146).

Assemble Your Real Estate Team
105
•	 Contractor. If you’re thinking about buying a fixer-upper or making 
significant renovations to a home, it’s a smart move to have a contrac-
tor estimate how much the repairs and renovations will cost before 
you submit an offer. 
•	 Escrow officer. Sometimes called an escrow agent or closing agent, 
this neutral third party makes sure that the transaction proceeds as it 
should—in other words, that both you and the seller are living up to 
your agreement. The escrow officer may be an attorney, a full-time es-
crow agent, or someone who works for a title agency. In a typical sale, 
the escrow officer has these responsibilities:
—
— Sets up an escrow account to hold money related to the sale, such 
as your earnest money (page 250), until closing
—
— Holds signed documents until all paperwork related to the sale is 
complete
—
— Performs the title search and arranges for title insurance
—
— Prorates costs, such as taxes and bills that the seller has already 
paid
—
— Prepares the final paperwork
—
— Distributes money due at closing
—
— Ensures that the sale happens properly and legally
•	 Insurance agent. At the closing, you need to prove to your lender that 
you’ve insured your property, so you need to find an insurance agent 
who specializes in homeowner’s insurance. Page 273 has tips on how 
to shop for homeowner’s insurance.
In some states, such as California and Arizona, brokers and title companies are 
allowed to prepare legal contracts and title documents, hold money in escrow, and 
close real estate deals. These states are called “escrow states.” In other states, such 
as New York, only attorneys can perform these tasks. These are called “title states.” 
Your real estate agent can tell you whether you’re in an escrow or title state. For 
more on how closings work in escrow states versus titles states, see Chapter 13.

Select Homes to Tour
It’s time to go house hunting! Before you get out the tape measure to see if 
your king-sized bed fits in the master bedroom, you need to put together 
a list of homes to tour—houses that fit your price range and meet your 
needs. In this section, you’ll find out how to add houses to your list by 
working with your agent, searching the Internet, and pounding the pave-
ment in your target neighborhoods.
Working with a Real Estate Agent
When you’ve got a buyer’s agent on your team, real estate listings come to 
you. It’s your agent’s job to keep an eye out for houses that fit your price 
range and wish list. So after you choose an agent (page 90 gives you tips 
for doing that), sit down and discuss what you’re looking for. Include these 
details:
•	 Price range
•	 Preferred style
•	 Number of bedrooms
•	 Number of bathrooms
•	 Preferred neighborhoods
•	 Any high-priority special requirements, such as a workshop, garage, or 
finished basement 
Your agent will search the MLS, also known as the Multiple Listing Service, 
an exhaustive database of homes for sale in your region. Real estate agents 
subscribe to the MLS to pool their listings and make it easy for agents to 
find potential homes for their clients. A typical MLS listing includes one or 
more photos of the house, its asking price, its square footage, the number 
and types of rooms, the lot size, and other information. When your agent 
finds properties that look like a good fit, she’ll send you the listings via 
email or call you to discuss them. If any of the listings look appealing, your 
agent sets up appointments to get you inside the houses so you can take a 
look around. She’ll meet you at each home and give you a tour.
If you wrote up a wish list (page 77), give your agent a copy. It will help her remem-
ber what you want as she scours listings for you.

These tips will help you get the most out of working with a buyer’s agent:
•	 Keep appointments and be on time. Setting up tours of six or seven 
homes on a Saturday takes a lot of coordination: The current occu-
pants need to vamoose so you can feel free to look around, and the 
listing agent may want to be there. If you’re late, the carefully planned 
appointments topple over like a stack of dominoes—and you may not 
be able to tour all the houses you planned to see.   
•	 Don’t waste the agent’s time. Remember that most agents work on 
commission (page 85)—if they don’t close a deal, they don’t get paid. 
So if you’re not really sure whether you’re ready to buy a house, don’t 
sign up with an agent yet. Scratch your real estate itch by visiting open 
houses instead (page 120).
•	 Be proactive. Keep an eye on local listings yourself by reading the 
newspaper and checking Internet real estate sites (page 114). If you 
see a home you like, contact your agent to discuss the property and 
arrange a showing.
•	 Don’t call listing agents yourself. If you see a For Sale sign in a yard 
or an ad in the paper, don’t call the property’s listing agent to set up a 
showing. If you do, the listing agent will expect to represent you in any 
negotiations—putting you in a dual agency conundrum (see page 83). 
Instead, call your agent, identify the property you’re interested in, and 
let her handle things from there.
•	 Ask questions. They say the only stupid question is the one you don’t 
ask. Your agent is a resource with a lot of experience helping people 
buy homes—make good use of that resource. If you have any ques-
tions about the process or the papers you sign, ask.
•	 Communicate. Agents can do a lot of things for you, but reading your 
mind isn’t one of them. At every stage of the process, communicate 
clearly. Let your agent know what you’re looking for, when you’re avail-
able, and how you want her to contact you. If problems arise (for ex-
ample, if the agent isn’t staying in touch as often as you’d like), let her 
know. That’s the only way you can work together to find a solution.
Some agents walk with you from room to room; others hang back and let you 
explore on your own. If you have a preference, let your agent know.

Chapter 5
110
•	 Give feedback. After you tour some homes, talk to your agent about 
what you liked and disliked about each. This helps her narrow her fo-
cus in finding properties for you to tour. The more she knows about 
your preferences, the better she can target homes to show you.
•	 Get referrals for other real estate professionals. Your agent works 
with lenders, appraisers, home inspectors, insurers, and other profes-
sionals on a regular basis. Tap into her network by asking for a list of 
recommendations. It’s still up to you, of course, to research the candi-
dates and make a decision.
Decoding Real Estate Ads
Real estate ads—whether online, in the classified section of a newspaper, 
or in one of those free regional “homes for sale” magazines—have their 
own language. As a new homebuyer, you may feel like you need a crash 
course in real-estate-ese to make sense of them. Otherwise, you could be 
disappointed when you arrive at a house expecting “charming period de-
tails” and find scuffed hardwood floors and cracked plaster walls.
It’s the listing agent’s job to stimulate buyer interest in a home. Naturally, 
the agents write ads that make each house seem as enticing as possible. 
With just a few words, they try to create a picture in your mind’s eye and 
a homey feeling that makes you want to pick up the phone and schedule 
a tour. Although some ads use descriptive terms like sunny and efficiency 
kitchen realistically, others use them as euphemisms to put the best spin 
on potential issues, trying to turn deficits into features. 
When your agent has a clear idea of what you’re looking for, she’ll be able to contact 
you as soon as she hears about a good match coming on the market—sometimes 
before the house gets listed on the MLS.
Chapter 4 lists questions to ask the real estate professionals you’ll need on your 
team.

Frequently Asked Question
The Best Time to Go Househunting
Are some times of year better than others to shop for a home?
Conventional wisdom says that most homebuyers start shopping for homes in 
the spring—and conventional wisdom is right. Or mostly right. In many parts of 
the country, the cold, dark days of winter melting into flower-filled spring inspire 
people to get out and look for new quarters. Also, many people, if given the choice, 
prefer to move in the summer: The weather is less likely to cause moving-day prob-
lems, and parents want their kids to switch schools with minimal hassle. So if you 
shop in the spring through early summer, be aware that you’ll probably have more 
competition than at other times of year.
Real estate sales tend to slow down in November, December, and January, and then 
gradually begin gathering steam again until they’re in full force again in the spring 
and early summer. If you shop during the slower months, you may find that sellers 
are more flexible, especially if a home’s been on the market for a while.
One caveat: In climates prone to hot, humid summers—especially those popular 
with retirees—the cooler winter months may be prime house-hunting season. Ask 
your real estate agent about local sales trends and whether some months are better 
than others for home shopping.
At the same time, of course, sellers are aware of the cyclical nature of the real estate 
market, and some wait until sales heat up before they list their homes. So even 
though you’ll have more competition in the busy season, you’ll have more choice 
as well.

Shopping on the Internet
People shop for all kinds of items online: books, music, clothes, electronics, 
jewelry, furniture—and yes, even houses. You can’t put a house in a virtual 
shopping cart and buy it with a single mouse click, but you can search the 
Web to find houses for sale. Looking at homes online is a great way to ac-
quaint yourself with what’s on the market, get a sense of prices, familiarize 
yourself with real-estate ads, and even take a peek inside available homes. 
Online research is particularly useful if you’re relocating to an area far from 
your current home, because you can glean a lot of information and narrow 
your choices using online listings before you travel to tour homes in per-
son. But even if you’re searching locally, online real estate sites keep you 
abreast of the market and let you look at listings on your own time.
Realtor.com
A good website to start your online search is Realtor.com (www.realtor.
com), sponsored by the National Association of Realtors. This site has ac-
cess to information from more than 800 MLSes across the United States 
and Canada. You can search all the listings for an area by typing in a city 
and state or province and then clicking the Search button, or you can get 
specific and tell Realtor.com to look for homes that match your price range 
and wish list criteria: number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, type of 
housing (single family, multi-family, condo, and so on), minimum size, and 
preferred features (fireplace, central air, laundry room, and so on).
After you tell Realtor.com what to search for, you get a list of available 
properties. You can sort this list by price or by number of photos per listing 
(to get a good sense of the way the place looks), or you can see the results 
on a map, letting you concentrate on listings in a particular neighborhood.
The listings vary in detail according to how much information the listing 
agent included, but most have at least one photo of the house (featured 
listings may have as many as 25), a rundown of its features and specifica-
tions, a way to contact the listing agent, and links to more of the agent’s 
listings.
Page 52 describes popular styles of single-family houses.
A survey conducted by the National Association of Realtors showed that, in 2008, 
one-third of all homebuyers began their search online. And 87 percent of them 
used the Internet to shop for a home at some point in the process.

If you register (registration is optional and free), you can save your searches 
and individual listings to go back to them later—although the site auto-
matically keeps track of your last five searches and the last five properties 
you view, even if you don’t register. Registration also lets you opt in to re-
ceive email alerts when there’s a change to one of your saved searches, or 
when new listings come on the market in the area you’re searching.
Trulia
Trulia (www.trulia.com) is a real estate search site brimming with useful 
data—and it’s free. You search it just as described above: Enter informa-
tion about the area you want to live in and (if you want) your price range 
and preferred features. Trulia’s unique feature is the way it lets you sort the 
results. You get a plethora of options:
•	 Newest. Seeing new listings as soon as they come on the market can 
give you an edge over other buyers.
•	 Number of photos. Before you make an appointment to look at a 
house, you can check out the inside and the surroundings. Lots of pic-
tures give you a clearer sense of whether this would be a good prop-
erty to tour.
•	 Price. You can sort listings from lowest price to highest, or the other 
way around.
•	 Price reduced date. When a seller reduces a home’s list price, it’s a 
good indication that he’s getting impatient to sell. You may be able to 
reach an agreement quickly or, if the price was reduced several weeks 
or months ago, find a seller who’s open to counteroffers.

Chapter 5

•	 Price reduced $ (high to low). This sorts reduced-price listings by dol-
lar value—from those that have had the greatest drop in dollar value 
to those that have dropped the least.
•	 Price reduced % (high to low). You can also sort reduced-price list-
ings by how much the price has dropped as a percentage of the origi-
nal list price, from greatest percentage to least. For example, if the 
prices of two houses have both dropped by $10,000 but the first was 
originally priced at $600,000 and the second at $200,000, the second 
home’s price has dropped more in terms of percentage: 5 percent vs. 
1.5 percent for the more expensive home.
•	 More sort options. You can sort listings by just about any criterion 
that’s important to you: Number of bedrooms or bathrooms, square 
footage, address, popularity of listing (how often other people have 
viewed it), and property type (single family, condo, land, and so on).
Tell Trulia to find only listings with upcoming open houses or only listings that 
have been reduced in price (or both) by turning on the appropriate checkbox 
when you search.

When you see a listing that looks interesting, click its address to get more 
information. The listing page has several tabs:
•	 Home Facts. This tab gives you the listing’s basics: price, size, number 
of bedrooms and bathrooms, lot size, how long the listing has been 
on Trulia, and so on. Trulia calculates the price per square foot, which 
is useful when you want to compare how much living space different 
homes (and homes in different neighborhoods) offer for the price. 
Clicking the View More Details button takes you to the listing’s page 
on the real estate agency’s website.
•	 Photos. You can look at photos on the Home Facts tab, but the im-
ages are bigger and easier to scrutinize on this tab. Handily, this tab 
includes a number that tells you how many photos you can view. This 
tab may display both exterior and interior photos, depending on what 
the listing agent uploaded.
•	 Maps & Nearby. View the home in the context of its neighborhood 
by clicking this tab. You can see the home’s location on a zoomable 
map and the locations of nearby schools, gas stations, grocery stores, 
restaurants, and banks. For many locations, you can see street-level 
photos of the neighborhood—especially helpful if you’re searching at 
a distance and can’t easily hop into the car and drive past.
•	 Comparables. Select this tab to see a map pinpointing other, nearby 
homes for sale in your price range. Hover your mouse pointer over any 
house location to open a box showing the comparable property and 
its price. Click “View more details” to open that property’s listing page.
•	 Sales Trends. Trulia’s strength is in giving you fast, useful information 
about local housing trends. Click this tab for an at-a-glance view of 
how a home compares to other listings in the area: its price in relation 
to those of similar homes and to those of all homes for sale in the town 
or neighborhood you’re looking at. This tab also shows a graph chart-
ing the area’s average listing price from week to week, so you can see 
whether prices are heading up or down.
 When you search listings, click the Recently Sold tab to see the prices of compa-
rable properties that recently sold in your search area. Comparing a home’s listing 
price with the actual prices of recent sales can give you a good idea of whether the 
home you’re considering is overpriced or a good bargain.

•	 Mortgage. This tab includes a mortgage calculator so you can figure 
out a home’s affordability. It also displays the current mortgage rates 
from a selection of banks. Keep in mind, though, that the mortgage 
payment calculator includes only principal and interest—taxes and in-
surance will be extra.
•	 Schools. This tab displays a map showing a house’s location and its 
nearby schools. You can zoom in or out on the map. Click a school to 
see the school’s address, phone number, and how many students and 
teachers it has. Click the name of the school to open Trulia’s profile 
page for that school.
Yahoo Real Estate
One of the most popular real estate sites, Yahoo Real Estate (http://real-
estate.yahoo.com) lists more than 4 million homes across the country. You 
can search for a home according to your preferences or restrict your search 
to just newly built homes or just foreclosures. Sort the results by price, size, 
number of bedrooms, or number of bathrooms.
Yahoo Real Estate gives a market snapshot of the city or town where you’re 
househunting, including number of homes on the market, median price, 
and whether price trends are headed up or down. There’s also information 
about mortgage rates in the area.
Zillow.com
Zillow (www.zillow.com) is helpful when you’re looking at home values in 
a particular neighborhood (page 240), but it’s also a great place to search 
for a home. Like other real estate sites, you can enter your search criteria 
and sort the results by price, size, and number of bedrooms or bathrooms. 
Zillow listings include some unique features:
•	 Zestimate. Zillow expresses its estimate of what a particular home is 
worth as both a specific price and a “value range,” a high and low es-
timated market value. The smaller the value range, the more accurate 
the estimate.
•	 Walk Score. By looking at how close a home is to nearby amenities, 
Zillow assigns a score that indicates how easy it is to live a car-free life-
style; the higher the Walk Score, the more walkable the home’s neigh-
borhood. The Walk Score has these categories and score ranges:
•	 Car-Dependent, Driving Only (0–24). You need a car to get from the 
home to just about anywhere else. 
•	 Car-Dependent (25–49). There may be an amenity or two within 
walking range, but you need a car to get from this home to most 
destinations. 

Shop for Your Home

•	 Somewhat Walkable (50–69). You can walk to some stores and other 
amenities, but many errands require a car. 
•	 Very Walkable (70–89). You can leave the car in the garage for most 
of your errands.
•	 Walkers’ Paradise (90–100 ). Car? Who needs a car?
Agency websites
The big, national real estate agencies have websites you can use to launch 
your search for a house. Start with any of these: 
•	 Century 21 (www.century21.com)
•	 Coldwell Banker (http://coldwellbanker.com)
•	 GMAC (www.gmacrealestate.com)
•	 Prudential Real Estate (www.prudential.com/realestate)
•	 RE/MAX (www.remax.com)
Each site lets you search by location, but the results show only homes 
listed with that agency’s local office. You can also use these sites to find a 
buyer’s agent and read articles about real estate.
Online classifieds
In ancient times (that is, before the Internet), people used to search for a 
home by getting the local paper and scouring the Real Estate section of 
the classified ads. You can still do that, of course, but it’s a lot easier and 
faster to search the classifieds online. You’ll get better results, too, because 
more and more classified advertising has moved off the page and onto 
the Web. Most newspaper websites have a Classifieds link or a Real Estate 
link (or both) that takes you to a page where you can view and sort current 
listings.
The best-known online classified ad side is craigslist (http://craigslist.org). 
Listing agents and “For Sale By Owner” sellers both use craigslist to adver-
tise their properties. From the main craigslist page, select the region (state, 
city, province, or country) you’re interested in. Then, under “housing” in the 
middle column, click “real estate for sale.” Listings appear throughout the 
day; click any listing for more information and to contact the poster.
You can search for a new home on any of the real estate websites listed in this 
section; most of them have the same listings. Try each of them, and then work with 
the one that gives you the most useful information.

Cruising Neighborhoods
If you’re moving to a different area in your city or to a nearby town, make 
an effort to drive, bike, or walk through the neighborhood where you hope 
to find a home. Sometimes an agent will plant a For Sale sign a day or two 
before the listing appears on the MLS, Realtor.com, or her agency’s web-
site. If you notice a sign in front of a house that interests you, jot down the 
listing agent’s name and phone number. Then call your agent and ask her 
to set up a showing. 
Asking Around
Tap into your network of friends and acquaintances; let everyone know 
that you’re planning to buy a home. Spread the word among your friends, 
neighbors, coworkers, and other acquaintances. Someone may pipe up 
and say, “I know someone in that neighborhood who’s planning to move.” 
Getting an early lead on a potential listing can give you an edge—espe-
cially if you come recommended by a friend of the seller. Some people 
have bought homes this way before the properties ever made it onto the 
market. 
Attending Open Houses
During an open house, usually held for a couple of hours on a Saturday 
or Sunday, you can tour a home at your own convenience and your own 
pace. An agent (or the seller of a FSBO) hosts. You can come in, pick up an 
information sheet listing the basics (number of bedrooms and bathrooms, 
square footage, and so on), look around, and ask questions. The host may 
ask you to take a business card or write your name and contact informa-
tion on a guest sheet; the reason for the latter is so that, if you or your 
agent inquires about a listing and it turns out to be the same house, any 
eventual sale gets credited to the agent who hosted the open house. 
Your buyer’s agent doesn’t have to accompany you to an open house. If 
you’re thinking about making an offer on the home, though, be sure to let 
the listing agent know that you’re already working with an agent—and 
get your agent involved ASAP.
An open house is an informal drop-in tour. But approach an open house 
the same way you approach a private tour (page 108): Bring along your 
wish list, take notes, look past the fresh flowers on the dining room table 
and the nice-smelling potpourri in the master bathroom, and evaluate the 
home as a place you might want to live.

Bargain Hunting
Thanks to eye-popping price tags and decades-long loan repayment 
schedules, homebuyers want the most for their money. Your buyer’s agent 
will tell you which homes are a good deal and will negotiate with sellers 
and their agents to help you get the best price. But you might want to look 
beyond the MLS for bargain properties your agent might miss. This section 
explains how to find these homes—FSBOs, short sales, foreclosures, and 
auctions—along with their advantages and disadvantages.
For Sale by Owner (FSBO)
Some sellers decide to do without an agent and sell their homes them-
selves, often to avoid paying an agent’s commission. They pound a For Sale 
sign into the front lawn, buy an ad in the classifieds or post one online, 
schedule an open house—and wait for buyers to come to them. A house 
that’s For Sale By Owner is called a FSBO, pronounced fizz-bo.
It might surprise you to learn that somewhere between 15 and 20 percent 
of the homes on the market are FSBOs. For you, the buyer, that means you 
could come across a good prospect that your agent doesn’t know about. 
Many buyer’s agents don’t spend much time looking for FSBOs for their 
clients (although some agents seek out these properties in the hope that 
they can convince the seller to list the home with them). So it’s up to you 
to find FSBOs to tour.
Be friendly to the agent who hosts an open house; she’s your link to the seller. 
When an offer comes in, it’s not unusual for a seller to ask, “Well, you met this buyer 
at the open house; what did you think?” Make a good impression, and the agent 
will pass on that impression to the seller.
Because there’s no listing agent, most FSBOs don’t appear in the MLS, although 
some FSBO sellers pay an agent a one-time fee to list their home with that service. 
But plenty of sites specialize in FSBO listings; see the list below.

Chapter 5
122
FSBO sellers usually advertise by putting up a sign and taking out an ad 
in the local newspaper’s Classifieds section. Online classified ads on sites 
like craigslist (page 119) are also popular. You may see notices tacked up 
on community bulletin boards (at a local coffee shop or bookstore). There 
are some websites that specialize in FSBO listings, although you’ll find far 
fewer listings on these than on sites like Realtor.com and Trulia:
•	 ForSaleByOwner.com.
•	 FSBO.com.
•	 Owners.com.
Working with a FSBO seller through your agent
If you’ve been working with a buyer’s agent, call him and let him know 
that you’re interested in a FSBO. If you want to make an offer, the agent will 
get in touch with the seller to ask whether the seller will pay his commis-
sion from the sale’s proceeds. This isn’t as outrageous as it may sound: As 
page 85 explains, the seller usually pays the commission, and the agents 
involved split it. Your agent will ask the seller to pay a “co-operative” com-
mission of 2 to 4 percent. A homeowner eager to sell may agree, especially 
in a slow market. After all, here’s a buyer ready to move forward, and the 
seller may be willing to absorb your agent’s fee to close the sale.
Of course, the seller may refuse. Many FSBO sellers are dead set against 
paying any commission (after all, that’s why they’re FSBOing). If that hap-
pens, your agent, who needs to get paid one way or another other, will dis-
cuss his fee with you—meaning you’ll pick up the cost of the commission, 
so take it into account when you make your offer. Make sure you and your 
agent agree on that fee before you proceed, and get it in writing.
Keep in mind that a FSBO is not necessarily a bargain. Sellers who don’t have an 
agent to advise them on sales of comparable properties and the current state of 
the market may overprice their homes.
If you decide to buy a FSBO, don’t cut your agent out of the deal to avoid paying 
the commission. It’s unethical and, depending on the terms of your agency agree-
ment, you could get sued.

Shop for Your Home
123
After you settle the commission issue, working with your agent to buy a 
FSBO is no different from working with your agent to buy any other home, 
except that your agent negotiates directly with the seller (or maybe the 
seller’s attorney), rather than the seller’s agent. 
Working with a FSBO seller on your own
If you’re not already working with a buyer’s agent and you decide to buy 
a FSBO, you can do so on your own. The first thing you should do is find 
a real estate lawyer to help you with the paperwork, starting with your 
purchase offer. (In some states, only a qualified attorney can write certain 
real estate documents.) You need to be absolutely certain that whatever 
papers you sign conform to the laws of your state, that you understand 
what’s in them, and that whatever you sign doesn’t put you at some legal 
disadvantage. Only a qualified lawyer can advise you on legal matters re-
lated to real estate. So get one on your team.
When you work directly with a FSBO seller, these tips will help make the 
transaction as smooth as possible:
•	 Know values for comparable houses in the neighborhood. An 
agent can advise you about whether a home is reasonably priced for 
its size, condition, and area, but it’s harder to judge that on your own. 
Compare prices using resources like Trulia (page 115), home appraisal 
site Zillow (www.zillow.com), City-Data.com (type in a zip code and 
scroll down the page that opens to the Recent Home Sales form), and 
local records of recent sales (the local newspaper often publishes them, 
sometimes online, or contact the office of your local city or county 
clerk and ask how to search recent sales). 
•	 Be a good negotiator. Whether you’re buying or selling, one excel-
lent reason to work with an agent is to have an experienced profes-
sional handle negotiations on your behalf. Negotiating on your own 
can be trickier. You get emotionally involved, and tempers can flare. 
Some FSBO sellers have fixed expectations about their selling price 
and won’t budge; others are more flexible. When you sit down with 
the seller to ask for concessions, be prepared. Have everything written 
down and back it up with solid reasoning. Be willing to compromise on 
the little things to gain more leverage on the big things. And approach 
negotiations with the goal of creating a win-win situation for both par-
ties—that’s the mark of a truly well-crafted negotiation.
Page 101 has a list of questions to ask real estate attorneys before you hire one.

Chapter 5
124
•	 Get a thorough home inspection. You’ll do this anyway (Chapter 12 
explains why), but a home inspection is super-important when you 
buy a FSBO. Most states require sellers to disclose any known prob-
lems with a property, whether or not they’re working with an agent. 
But a few states don’t. Make home inspection a contingency (page 
251) of your offer—and then protect yourself with the best home in-
spection you can get. 
Buying a FSBO without an agent to guide you and look out for your inter-
ests will require extra time and effort on your part. And if you’re a first-time 
homebuyer, you’re more likely to have a lot of questions and make po-
tentially costly mistakes (the latter’s the reason you absolutely must hire a 
good real estate attorney). But it can be done, and it may save you some 
money.
Short Sales
A short sale happens when you buy a home whose purchase price is 
lower than what the seller owes on the mortgage. In other words, the 
amount you pay for the house “falls short” of the amount owed. Short 
sales usually happen when a homeowner has run into serious financial 
trouble—the loan may already be in default, and the homeowner is try-
ing to avoid foreclosure.
Occasionally, a seller who’s in a hurry to move will accept a short-sale offer 
and make up the price difference to fully pay off the loan. Usually, though, 
a short sale means that the home’s mortgage holder is going to get less 
money than it’s owed, and it’s no shocker that financial institutions don’t 
like losing money. So the lender must approve a short sale before you can 
move forward. Lenders accept short sales when paying foreclosure costs 
would be more expensive than what the lender loses on the sale. That’s not 
just because a foreclosure racks up attorney’s fees and saps lenders’ time. 
After a foreclosure, the lender owns the house, and most would rather not 
be in the real estate business, pouring money into taxes, maintenance, in-
surance, and so on for the foreclosed homes sitting on their books. 
To approve a short sale, lenders want the property and the seller to meet 
these conditions:
•	 The home has lost market value. When the real estate bubble burst 
in the late 2000s and house prices plummeted, many homeowners 
suddenly found themselves owing more on their mortgage than the 
house was worth. The lender will require proof (such as recent sales 
data for comparable homes) that the home is now worth less than 
what the seller owes on the mortgage.

Shop for Your Home
125
•	 The mortgage is in or near default. A lender is unlikely to approve 
a short sale if the seller’s mortgage payments are current—usually a 
lender approves a short sale only after it has sent a notice of default 
to the owner. So a seller in good standing can’t drop the price below 
the mortgage balance just because she’s in a hurry to sell (unless, of 
course, she pays the difference herself).
•	 The seller is experiencing significant financial hardship. The lender 
requires a letter from the seller explaining why he’s unable to fully re-
pay the bank’s loan. Hardships might include unemployment, a medical 
emergency, or the death of a co-owner. If the seller isn’t experiencing 
serious hardship (if, for example, the seller is simply in a hurry to move), 
the lender is unlikely to approve a short sale.
•	 The seller has no assets. From the lender’s point of view, any asset the 
seller owns—such as a savings account, stocks or bonds, or other real 
estate—could go toward paying the difference between the selling 
price and the amount owed. The lender expects the seller to use such 
assets to pay back her mortgage in full.
As this list suggests, a short sale isn’t a happy occasion for either the lender 
or the seller. The seller has gone through a difficult time to get to the brink 
of a short sale. It will damage his credit record (although not as much as 
a foreclosure would), and he’s lost all the money he invested in the home. 
A short sale also may not be as good a deal as it looks at first. If you con-
sider only the difference between what the seller owes and what you of-
fer, a short sale can seem like a terrific bargain. But there’s a reason the 
seller’s willing to sell short—find out what that reason is. For example, if 
area house prices have fallen sharply, the house may be worth less than 
you think it is (especially if the market hasn’t yet bottomed out). 
If you decide to pursue a short sale, make sure you cover all these bases:
•	 Work with a buyer’s agent who’s experienced in short sales. Be-
cause these sales require some finesse and extra work, you want an 
agent who knows the terrain.
•	 Find out if the property is subject to any liens or second mortgages. 
If so, all the lenders involved have to approve a short sale—and the 
more lenders involved, the harder it is to gain everyone’s approval.
•	 Be prepared to pay extra costs. The lender is losing money in a short 
sale, so it’ll do everything it can to keep transaction-related costs low. 
The lender may negotiate a lower agents’ commission, for example, so 
if your agreement with your agent stipulates a minimum commission, 
whatever the lender doesn’t contribute comes out of your pocket. And 
the lender will probably refuse to pay any closing costs, so you’re on 
the hook for 100 percent of them.

Chapter 5
126
•	 Don’t expect money toward repairs. Short sales are as is. Be sure you 
include a property inspection contingency in your purchase agree-
ment (page 252) so you have an out if the home needs significant re-
pairs. For smaller problems, get an estimate of how much repairs will 
cost and decide whether you can afford them—or walk away from 
the sale. (Chapter 12 tells you all about home inspections.) Know in 
advance, though, that the lender will almost certainly be unwilling to 
contribute to the cost of repairs.
•	 Become familiar with the phrase, “Patience is a virtue.” A lender 
considering a short sale weighs the money lost now against potential 
future losses. Doing the math can take a long time. On the one hand, 
the lender doesn’t want to lose a chunk of the money it loaned the cur-
rent owner. On the other hand, the costs of foreclosing and then main-
taining the property (taxes, critical repairs, insurance, and so on) may 
be more than the lender is willing to shoulder. It can take time for the 
lender to sort all this out. It also takes time for the lender to verify the 
seller’s claims of financial hardship and check for assets. Homes adver-
tised as “Bank-Approved Short Sales” may close more quickly. After the 
lender has OKed the sale, though, it may expect you to move quickly, 
requesting settlement in as few as 30 days. So if you go the short sales 
route, be ready to move forward with your side of the transaction.
Foreclosures and Auctions
The skyrocketing foreclosure rate was one of the top news stories of the 
late 2000s. With the number of foreclosures hitting a new record in each 
quarter of 2009, the sheer volume of foreclosed homes has made bargain 
hunters perk up and pay attention. Buying a foreclosed home can save you 
some money on the purchase price, but the process is fraught with chal-
lenges, hassles, and costs that may outweigh the up-front price savings.
When a borrower defaults on mortgage payments, the lender may fore-
close on the loan. That means the lender repossesses the property, taking 
ownership and reselling it to recover at least some of the money owed on 
the loan. Lenders aren’t especially eager to foreclose, especially in an area 
with a high foreclosure rate—there’s lots of competition, the property may 
sit on the market for a while, and maintaining a foreclosed property gets

expensive. So a homeowner who’s in default often gets a grace period dur-
ing which she can try to catch up on payments. If she can’t, though, the 
lender starts the foreclosure process. There are three ways you can buy a 
property that’s in foreclosure (or heading there):
•	 Preforeclosure. During this phase, the lender has notified the home-
owner of impending foreclosure but hasn’t yet taken possession of 
the property. In many states, preforeclosure lasts only a month: the 30 
days between the time the current owner receives a notice of foreclo-
sure and when the bank takes ownership. When a home is in prefore-
closure, you may be able to buy it in a short sale (page 124). When you 
buy during preforeclosure, you deal directly with the current owner or 
the owner’s agent.
•	 At auction. When a bank owns a foreclosed property, it has to pay 
maintenance, property taxes, insurance, and so on. Lenders want to 
move foreclosed homes off their books quickly, and a popular way to 
do this is through a public auction (page 130 tells you more about buy-
ing a foreclosed home at auction). Third-party companies that special-
ize in real estate auctions usually conduct these sales (for example, see 
the “REDC” and “Williams and Williams” bullet points below).
•	 As an REO. Lenders call lender-owned properties REOs (for real estate 
owned, mimicking the line item on the lender’s books). Usually, an REO 
is a property that failed to sell at auction, and the lender has listed the 
home on the open market. When you buy an REO, you’re buying the 
property directly from a lender who’s also the owner, so you’ll deal di-
rectly with the lender or the lender’s agent.
Finding foreclosures
If you want to hunt for foreclosed homes, ask your real estate agent to 
search the MLS for REOs. And if you visit an area with many foreclosures, 
you’ll see yard signs that trumpet the property’s status with phrases like 
Bank Owned, Bank Repo, or Foreclosure. Call the listing agent (or ask your 
agent to do so) and say you’d like to learn about foreclosures that aren’t yet 
on the market—you may be able to get a jump on other bargain-seekers 
this way.
You can also discover foreclosures at these websites:

Disadvantages to buying a foreclosed property
Foreclosures happen to all kinds of properties, from manufactured homes 
to suburban tract houses to condos to luxurious mansions. A foreclosed 
property may look like a great deal compared to other homes on the mar-
ket, but before you buy, consider these caveats:
•	 You’re buying as is. Lenders selling foreclosed properties generally 
aren’t interested in negotiating reimbursements for repairs—they just 
want to unload the property and recoup as much of their money as they 
can. To make matters more complicated, you may not be able to tour the 
property or have it inspected before the sale. So you may have to pay for 
repairs that you don’t even know about at the time of the sale.
•	 You’ll have to pay any existing liens or back taxes. The previous 
owner may have used the house as collateral for other debts, fallen 
behind on taxes, or taken out a second mortgage to try to get caught 
up on the first. When you buy the home, these debts become your 
responsibility.
•	 You’re buying without any disclosures. When you buy a bank-
owned property, the bank can’t provide disclosures about the home’s 
history and condition. So there may be some nasty surprises after you 
move in. 
•	 The current owner or tenant may be uncooperative. If someone’s 
living in the property, you may have to evict them. Eviction can be 
an expensive and extremely unpleasant process. And it’s not uncom-
mon for angry former owners to damage the house or strip out items 
of value—such as plumbing fixtures and copper pipes—before they 
leave.
Buying real estate in an online auction isn’t for newbies or the faint-hearted. You’re 
buying a property, possibly sight unseen, in a frenzied contest with other bidders. 
If you want to buy a house this way, take the time to read and understand the 
auction company’s rules and policies. Be clear about everything you need to know 
about registration, inspection, down payment, financing, and the legalities before 
you bid.

Chapter 5
130
•	 The current owner may get the house back. Most states have laws 
that give homeowners some degree of protection in a foreclosure. 
Some states, for example, give former owners a grace period to buy 
back their auctioned home, a period that can last anywhere from 10 
days (in New Jersey) to a whole year (in Alabama). So if you buy a house 
at auction, you might have to give it up if the former owner comes up 
with the cash to buy it back. (If this happens, you get your purchase 
price back, but not any funds you spent on repairs or improvements.)
•	 Expect delays and more delays. Like short sales, foreclosures can 
move slower than molasses on a cold day. Lawsuits, paperwork, and 
other delays mean you can wait a long time (and face a lot of uncer-
tainty) before you can call a home yours.
•	 You’re competing with experienced real estate investors. Foreclo-
sures are popular with real estate investors—they buy houses at low 
prices, fix them up, and flip them to make a profit. Some investors flip 
houses for a living, and they’re aggressive in scooping up the best bar-
gains. In addition, if bids at an auction come in low, the lender itself will 
probably buy back the home and sell it as an REO for a higher price.
•	 You may not get clear title. If you bid on a property at auction, it’s 
your responsibility to research the state of the title (page 268) before 
you buy. (REOs listed with a real estate agency, on the other hand, 
come with clear title.)
Buying a property at auction
The process of buying an auctioned property differs from the real estate–
buying process you read about in other parts of this book. Before you 
show up at an auction ready to bid, understand how real estate auctions 
work. This section explains.
Foreclosure auctions may take place at the property itself, on the county 
courthouse steps, or at another location. Bidders register on-site to par-
ticipate. At the appointed time, an auctioneer appears, reads an opening 
statement, and starts the bidding. The first bid often comes from the lend-
er that holds the foreclosed mortgage, in an amount that covers what’s 
To find out whether a former owner can buy back her house—and how long she 
has to do it—take a look at the chart on Innovest Resource Management’s Foreclo-
sure Forum at www.foreclosureforum.com/basics.html, or ask a real estate lawyer.

owed, along with any money the lender spent on the foreclosure. Other 
bids may follow, continuing until the auctioneer decides the bidding has 
peaked. At that point, the auctioneer declares a winning bidder.
Although the auction itself is a simple, straightforward process, success at 
an auction requires both preparation and a cool head. If you’ve got your 
heart set on a particular property, it’s easy to get carried away during the 
bidding—and end up buying the house for more than you intended. Keep 
these auction tips in mind:
•	 Attend several auctions before you bid. You’ll be better prepared 
to participate if you’ve witnessed a few before you jump in with a bid.
•	 Do your homework. You may not be able to inspect a property be-
fore the auction begins, but you can—and must—do other kinds of 
research. What are the house’s basic specifications: its size, number of 
bedrooms/bathrooms, age, and so on? Is it currently inhabited? Are 
there any liens on the property? How much is it worth on today’s mar-
ket? If you don’t know the answers to these questions, you don’t know 
enough to buy the property.
•	 Decide on your maximum bid ahead of time. Once you know how 
much a house is worth, you’ve got a ceiling for your bid. During the 
auction, don’t bid higher than that ceiling. In the excitement of bid-
ding, it’s easy to bid more than you intend—and more than the house 
is worth. Don’t let your emotions land you in a bad deal.
•	 Be aware of auction-related costs. The auctioneer may charge a buy-
er’s premium, due at the close of the auction. Contact the auction com-
pany ahead of time to find out what fees you’ll need to pay if you win.
On-site auctions often have an open house for a couple of hours before the sale, so 
get there early and take a good look around.
Use Zillow (www.zillow.com) and local records of recent sales of comparable homes 
to estimate value (page 118). As you figure out how much to bid, it’s a good idea 
to subtract at least 10 percent from the market value in anticipation of repairs and 
updates.

Chapter 5
132
•	 On the day of the auction, have the necessary cash on hand. Some 
auctions require a minimum deposit immediately after the auction; 
others require payment in full, no financing allowed. Know what the 
rules are, and bring a cashier’s check with you to the sale.
•	 Arrange financing ahead of time. If the auction lets you finance the 
property (not all do), get preapproved. After the auction, you have a 
limited window of time to come up with the full amount you owe—
and if you can’t, you lose your deposit.
What to Look for on the Tour
Touring houses can be both exhilarating and exhausting. You know that 
one of these properties will become your new home, and you’re eager to 
find it. Yet you may have to visit many homes before the stars align and 
you’re ready to make an offer.
Your real estate agent may chauffeur you to the homes you view, or you 
may meet her there. When you arrive, the seller’s agent may be there to 
greet you, too, and to let you in; if not, your agent will remove a key from 
a secure lockbox to open the door. Your agent (or the seller’s agent) will 
have an information sheet of basic facts about the house—this may be a 
brochure or a printout of the MLS listing. You may get other information 
too, such as a seller’s disclosure form (see page 139 for what that is), utility 
cost estimates, and other facts that the seller thinks are useful to prospec-
tive buyers.
Once you’re inside, you’ll have the run of the house. You can walk through 
all the rooms, peek into closets and cupboards, measure windows, and ex-
plore the basement and attic. This section tells you how to get the most 
out of your tour.
It can be surprisingly difficult to get a good buy at auction. For one thing, you’re 
competing against experienced real estate investors who know enough to drop 
out quickly when a price moves out of bargain territory. In addition, the lender 
wants to recoup its investment. In a market where home values have dropped, the 
lender’s first bid may price everyone else out of the sale, because the amount still 
owed on the house is more than it’s currently worth.

Preparing to Visit Houses
As with so many other things, preparation is key to a successful house-
hunting tour. If you have everything in place before you set out to look 
at houses, you’ll be able to focus on how well each house meets your 
needs—and the visits will go much more smoothly. Before you venture 
out into the marketplace, keep these points in mind:
•	 Don’t overschedule yourself. If you try to look at too many houses in 
one day: They’ll all start to blur together, and you’ll have a hard time 
remembering each house individually. Six or seven house tours in a 
single day is a good upper limit—after that your brain starts to turn to 
mush. If you’re making a long-distance move, however, you may have 
to pack as many tours as you can into just a few days. That’s when a 
camera, checklist, and good note-taking skills become even more im-
portant. (Keep reading for tips on how to get organized and remember 
the houses you tour.)
•	 Get some rest. Study after study has shown that people who are tired 
find it hard to focus and make decisions. That’s not the condition you 
want to be in as you look at prospective homes. People with busy 
schedules may have to squeeze in a showing whenever they have 
time, and if you’re moving a long distance you may have to pack a lot 
of showings into a few days’ househunting trip. But if possible, try to 
get a good night’s sleep before you tour homes.  
•	 Get a babysitter. Parents of young children may find that the kids 
disrupt the tour, running through rooms, hiding in closets, and beg-
ging to try out the backyard swing set. Even well-behaved children 
can distract you as you try to evaluate a potential home. The best time 
to bring the kids into the process is later, when you’ve narrowed down 
the possibilities and want to get the kids’ opinions on your choices.
•	 Gather your gear. Make sure you have a camera (page 136), your 
checklist (page 137) clipped to a clipboard, a list of questions to ask 
(page 138), a notebook, a pen or two, and a folder for collecting infor-
mation sheets. 
Before you start looking at houses, measure any large or unusually shaped pieces 
of furniture you want to move into your new home. Write down the measure-
ments. When you visit homes, take along those measurements—and a tape 
measure.

Keep an Open Heart and a Critical Eye
Buying a home is an emotional experience. To buy smart, you need to en-
gage heart and head alike. Although you should fall in love with the home 
you buy, you also want to be sure that you’re getting a house that’s a good 
value and will suit you and your family for the years you live there. These 
suggestions will help you see homes clearly as you tour them:
•	 Don’t be distracted by nice touches. Smart sellers make their homes 
look as welcoming as possible. They take down family photos (because 
it’s harder to imagine yourself living in a house with smiling strangers 
on the wall), remove pieces of furniture to make rooms look bigger, 
put out fresh flowers or bowls of fruit, and hang mirrors or position 
lamps to brighten dark rooms. This is called staging, and its purpose 
is to direct your attention away from a home’s less attractive features 
through the use of props. Don’t spend the tour admiring the dining 
room curtains or feeling tempted to relax on a pillow-covered sofa. 
Focus on the house, not its contents.
•	 Walk through the house as though you already live there. No, that 
doesn’t mean taking a quick nap on the owner’s bed or putting your 
feet up on the coffee table as you watch TV. But do think about how 
you use your home and see whether this home fits the way you live. 
For example, imagine yourself preparing a meal as you look around 
the kitchen. Is there sufficient counter space? Where would you keep 
pots and pans? Is the dishwasher convenient to the cupboard where 
you’ll store dishes and glassware? How about the bedrooms? Are they 
conveniently located relative to the bathrooms or will you have to 
walk halfway through the house in your bathrobe to get to the shower 
each morning?
•	 Put on your home inspector’s hat. You’ll hire a professional to do a 
complete home inspection and you’ll do a thorough walkthrough if 
you decide to buy the house, but on this first look, simply keep your 
eyes peeled for potential problems. Here are some things to watch for:
—
— Light switches. Flip them on and off to make sure they work.
—
— Water pressure. Turn on faucets in sinks and tubs to check water 
flow.
—
— Toilets. Flush toilets to make sure they empty and refill completely.
Professional stagers make a living by helping sellers transform ordinary houses 
into showplaces to impress buyers.

—
— Floors. Do they squeak (that’s a sign of loose nails)? Are they level 
or slanted? Are there soft spots next to the toilet or tub (that indi-
cates water damage)?
—
— Walls. Do you notice any cracks or bulges? They might be a sign of 
structural problems.
—
— Doors and windows. If they stick or don’t close squarely, you may 
need to repair or replace them—or they could be a sign that the 
foundation isn’t stable. Check exterior doors to see whether light 
gets through around the edges when the door is closed; if so, you 
may need to add insulation or refit the door.
—
— Sills. Look for signs of water damage, such as mildew or mold. Also 
check for peeling paint; in older homes, the paint may be lead-
based.
—
— Drafts. Check around windows and doors and along exterior walls. 
If the house is drafty, you’ll probably have to add insulation.
—
— Ceilings. Are there any stains or signs of water damage?
—
— Heating/cooling system. If it’s winter, is the ground floor warm 
or chilly around the edges? If the weather is warm, is the upstairs 
too hot?
—
— Appliances. Is the refrigerator cold? Do all of the burners work on 
the stove? If appliances come with the house, you’ll want to do a 
quick check that they’re in working order.
—
— Cabinets. Do the doors open and close easily? Are their shelves in 
good condition?
—
— Odors. If the house smells funny, you may have trouble getting rid 
of that odor after you move in.
—
— Basement. Are there cracks in the foundation? Those can indicate 
a need for expensive repairs.
—
— Roof. From the outside, check the roofline. Is it straight or does it 
appear to sag anywhere? Scan the roof for missing shingles or sag-
ging areas. (Binoculars can help here.) 
Federal law requires that sellers of homes built before 1978 give buyers a lead 
disclosure statement. See page 140 for more information about this form.

Chapter 5
136
•	 Remember that selling a home is an emotional experience for a 
homeowner. If the seller is present as you tour, don’t make disparaging 
remarks about decorating choices or funny smells (but do make a note 
of any odd odors in your notebook). The seller doesn’t have to agree 
to sell to you—and if she takes a dislike to you, she probably won’t. On 
the other hand, don’t gush over the home, either. If you come across as 
desperate to buy the place, you’ll put yourself at a disadvantage when 
it’s time to negotiate. Finally, if the seller seems particularly proud of 
some aspect of the home, you can make a favorable impression by 
complimenting the seller on it. For example, if the home has beautiful 
landscaping, you can admire it and talk about how you’d maintain it if 
you owned the home.
•	 When you’re thinking about making an offer, visit the home again. 
Try to visit on a different day and time. Write down any questions you 
have or things you want to double-check to make sure you don’t for-
get any concerns during the second tour. Bring along your checklist 
and notes, and compare your impressions on this visit with the first.
Bring a Camera
A digital camera or camcorder can be your best friend on a home tour. If 
you visit several homes in one day, taking photos or shooting brief video 
clips to review later will help you remember which house had the tiny 
kitchen, which had built-in bookshelves in the family room, and which had 
that hideous avocado tile in the master bath.
When you arrive at a home, the first photo or video you take should be a 
close-up of the house number to indicate that the photos/clips that follow 
go with that property. Take lots of photos or clips. Capture the home’s ex-
terior, its grounds, and each room. If there’s a feature you love, like a stone 
fireplace in the great room, get a record of it. If there’s a feature you hate, 
Sometimes, you’ll know that a home isn’t right for you as soon as you set foot in-
side the front door. If that happens, you can go ahead with the tour if you want—
maybe the property is a diamond in the rough—but don’t feel obliged to tour a 
home you know you won’t buy. Doing so is a waste of time, yours and the agents’ 
alike.
As a courtesy, ask permission to take photos or shoot video before you start. Un-
less a seller has specifically said, “No pictures,” it’s unlikely to be a problem.

like those avocado-colored tiles, capture that, too. Record anything you 
have a question about, as well. Seeing the image later will remind you to 
get an answer to that question.
Use Your Wish List As a Checklist
When you decided what you wanted in a new home, you created a wish 
list of preferred features and amenities (page 77). Now that you’re active-
ly shopping, turn that wish list into a checklist and keep track of which 
homes have the features you want.
Leave room at the top of the checklist so you can record the home’s ad-
dress, the date you saw it, how much the seller is asking, how long the 
house has been on the market, and who the listing agent is. Beneath that, 
list your preferred features and follow each one with three columns: Must 
Have, Would Like, and Y/N. The first two columns come directly from your 
wish list. The third is where you write “Y” if the home has that feature and 
“N” if it doesn’t.
Bring along copies of the checklist—one for each house you visit. Write 
the address at the top of each sheet and, as you go through a home, note 
which features it has and which it’s missing and write down explanatory 
notes. For example, maybe you’d like a fireplace in your new home’s family 
room: Write “no fireplace, but wood stove.”

Ask Questions
Touring a home gives you a chance to look around and decide whether 
you can picture yourself living there. But there’s more to a home than a 
floor plan and color scheme. The seller can give tell you about the home’s 
condition and history, which you need to consider before you buy.
Ask the seller or seller’s agent the following questions (if just you and your 
agent tour the house, have your agent pass questions on to the seller’s 
agent). Ask whatever questions occur to you, but use these to get started:
•	 How long has this home been on the market? Knowing how long 
a home’s been for sale may help you get a sense of whether the seller 
would be open to offers below the asking price.
•	 Why is the house on the market? There are many reasons people put 
a home up for sale: moving out of the area, upsizing or downsizing to 
a different home, settling an estate or a divorce, financial difficulties, 
and so on. When you have a sense of why the owner is selling, you and 
your agent can discuss the best way to approach him if you decide to 
make an offer.
•	 Are there any problems or disputes with neighbors? If the next-
door neighbors are embroiled in a lawsuit with the current owners 
over tree damage or property lines, you need to know about it.
•	 What repairs or updates have you made recently? Sellers are usu-
ally eager to highlight renovations as a selling point.
•	 Are any repairs likely to become necessary within the next couple 
of years? If the answer to this question is yes, be sure to take those re-
pairs into account when you budget for your new home (see page 26).
•	 How old is the roof? Are there any leaks? If the roof is older than 
15 years, you may need to replace it soon. Re-roofing can be a major 
expense, so if that’s on the horizon, you need to know.
•	 If the home has a basement, is it dry or damp? A damp (or flooded) 
basement can cause mold growth and damage wood and masonry.

Shop for Your Home

•	 When was the heating and/or air conditioning system installed? If 
it’s well maintained, the average furnace lasts for about 25 years. An air 
conditioner is good for maybe 15. If the heating and cooling system 
in the home is getting close to that age—or older—you may need to 
spend a few thousand dollars to replace it. 
•	 Has the seller prepared a written disclosure statement? A disclo-
sure statement lists known problems with the home, past and pres-
ent. Not all states require it, and among those that do the seller may 
not have to hand over a disclosure until after you make an offer. But 
ask for one anyway. The next section tells you more about disclosure 
statements.
•	 How much does the seller pay each month for utilities? You need 
to take utilities into account as you plan your monthly budget (page 
26). Ask about these:
—
— Heating fuel (gas, oil, propane)
—
— Electricity
—
— Trash collection
—
— Water
—
— Homeowners’ association fees (if any)
—
— Any other recurring fees (ask what these are)
•	 Do you have any pets? Pets can cause damage you need to check for. 
If you’re allergic to animals, it may take some effort to make the home

Tell You 
More than two-thirds of all states require a seller to tell prospective home-
buyers the condition and history of the house. (That means that some 
states don’t impose this requirement—more on those in a moment.) A 
seller’s disclosure spells out all of the home’s known defects and problems 
(see this book’s Missing CD at http://www.missingmanuals.com/cds/ for 
sample forms for Indiana and Texas).
Your home inspector will look for problems with the home’s structure and systems, 
but it’s a good idea to ask about known issues before the inspection. If the inspec-
tor knows about specific problems, he can spend extra time checking them out.

Chapter 5
140
States that require disclosure statements use a standard form that details 
a property’s legal, structural, and environmental condition. The forms vary 
from state to state. Some are only a couple of pages long; others go into 
a lot more detail and can run to 10 pages. Short or long, a disclosure typi-
cally touches on the following issues:
•	 Whether the seller has lived in the home (and if so, when)—some sell-
ers inherited the home or bought it as an investment
•	 Roof condition
•	 Any known structural problems, such as a cracked foundation
•	 Water and sewage systems
•	 Electrical system
•	 Heating and air conditioning system
•	 Plumbing system
•	 Appliances included in the sale
•	 Environmental hazards, such as flooding, earthquake, or hurricane 
damage
•	 Hazardous substances within the home, such as lead paint or asbestos
•	 Mold growth
•	 Municipal violations against the property
•	 Legal disputes involving the property
•	 Zoned district
Not every form covers all these issues, and different regions have different 
requirements. For example, California requires earthquake hazard disclo-
sure, but states in the middle and eastern parts of the country don’t. In 
Alaska, a seller must disclose whether a home has ever been damaged by 
an avalanche—but you won’t find that requirement in Georgia.
Federal law states that sellers of homes built before 1978 must provide 
buyers with a lead disclosure statement (as shown on the previous page; 
go to this book’s Missing CD at www.missingmanuals.com/cds/ to see the 
lead disclosure form). (The Consumer Products Safety Commission banned 
lead-based paint in 1978, which is the reason for the cut-off date.) If the 
seller knows that the house contains lead-based paint (or has contained 
it in the past), he must say so on this form. If he or a previous owner has 
taken steps to remediate the lead problem, the seller attaches proof to the 

Shop for Your Home
141
form. But the seller also has the option of saying that he has no knowledge 
of whether the home contains lead-based paint. If that’s what your disclo-
sure form says, make sure you include a lead-based paint inspection con-
tingency (page 252) in your purchase offer and have the home inspected 
for lead.
How do you know that you can trust a disclosure? States that require them 
impose serious penalties for not telling the truth. A seller who lies (or omits 
information) on a disclosure statement may face fines, responsibility for 
your legal costs, and reversal of the sale.
Ask for a copy of the disclosure statement before you make an offer. Some 
sellers prefer to hand it over after you sign the purchase agreement, but 
it’s best to know the problems a house has when you calculate your offer.
Ask for a disclosure statement even if you live in a state that doesn’t require 
one. In those states, the state Realtors Association probably has a volun-
tary standard form. An acceptable alternative would be a home inspec-
tion report paid for by the owner. (You’ll still want your own inspection, 
though, to double-check what the seller reports.)
Evaluate the Neighborhood
When you targeted areas for your search (page 72), you identified the fea-
tures and amenities you want in a neighborhood. Whether you’re looking 
only in neighborhoods you chose then or you’re searching more broadly, 
pull out the list and use it to evaluate the environments of the homes you 
tour. For example, maybe one home is a few streets beyond the boundary 
of a neighborhood you want, but it’s next door to a park or within walking 
distance of the library.
Spend time in the neighborhood. Take a walk, visit the café around the 
corner, drive through at night to see whether the atmosphere is quiet or 
lively. Talk to your potential neighbors and ask them what they like most 
and least about their homes’ location. Even if you did some of this legwork 
earlier, it’s a good exercise as you zero in on possible homes, rather than 
getting a feel for a wider area.
Real estate agents must also disclose any flaws in the home that they know about. 
So if a seller confides to his agent that there’s a problem with the foundation, for 
example, the agent must pass that information on to potential buyers.

Chapter 5
142
Compare Homes
As you look at homes, the more information you collect, the more data 
points you’ll have when you sit down to compare properties. You probably 
won’t buy a home based solely on your checklists—gut feelings and emo-
tions will come into play. Most likely, you’ll have a positive impression of a 
couple of homes that seem like good candidates. If you’re buying a home 
with someone else—your spouse or a partner, for example—sit down and 
talk about your impressions. You may or may not be in sync. Pull out your 
notes, photos, and checklists to support your impressions as you try to 
reach consensus.
Use your checklists to compare features and amenities. Try this: Create a 
spreadsheet and label the far-left column Address. In that column, list the 
homes you’re considering. Moving right, fill in the top row with amenities 
and features you identified as important in your wish list (page 77). For 
each house, type in a 2 for each “must have” feature the house possesses 
or a 1 for each “would like” feature. If the house is missing a feature, leave 
the cell blank. After you fill in the spreadsheet, add up the numbers for 
each house. The one with the highest sum comes closest to fulfilling your 
wish list. That doesn’t mean it’s the house you’ll buy. There are other factors 
to weigh, such as price, location, and how the home feels to you, but the 
spreadsheet helps you sort through the information you collect and look 
at it objectively.
As you compare homes, consider this: Shopping for a home is a lot like dat-
ing. It can be fun, and you might fall in love. But buying a home is more like 
a marriage: After the honeymoon, you’ve got to settle down to the busi-
ness of living with your choice. Keep that long-term commitment in mind 
as you visit, inspect, and compare homes.

Finance Your Down Payment

6	 Finance Your Down 
Payment
T
he variety and number of fees you have to pay when you buy a 
home can set your head spinning. They run the gamut from your 
lender’s $35 credit-check fee to several hundred dollars for a home 
inspection to thousands of dollars in loan administration fees. But by far 
the biggest chunk of cash you need to come up with is the down payment, 
a percentage of your home’s purchase price—usually in the range of 3.5 to 
20 percent. 
For many homebuyers, coming up with the down payment is the biggest 
obstacle to buying a home. Unless you’re independently wealthy, you’ve 
had a recent windfall (an inheritance or a lucky horse, for example), or 
you’re selling a home in which you’ve built up some equity, you probably 
don’t have tens of thousands of dollars lying around to invest in a new 
home. This chapter helps you come up with your down payment. It starts 
off by explaining why lenders require such a hefty down payment in the 
first place, then moves on to strategies, both traditional and creative, for 
finding the money to put down on your new home.

Chapter 6
144
Why a Down Payment?
You might wonder why lenders insist that you pour thousands of dollars of 
your own money into a home. After all, lenders make money from loans, so 
you’d think they’d want to give you as much cash as possible.
That’s true, but lenders also need assurance that you’ll repay the loan. To 
get that implied promise, they require you to have a personal financial 
stake in your house. From the lender’s point of view, when you pay for part 
of the house with a pile of your own hard-earned cash, you’re much more 
likely to pay back the loan. It shows you’re committed to buying—and pay-
ing for—your new home.
As an extension of that assumption, the more money you invest in a down 
payment, the better you look to a lender. That’s why borrowers who make 
higher down payments (20 percent or more) can get better terms and 
avoid paying private mortgage insurance (PMI, page 146). 
Even if you don’t fork over 20 percent of your home’s purchase price, you 
need a down payment in almost all cases. Few lenders hand over the entire 
purchase price of a home. In the wake of the subprime mortgage crisis of 
the late 2000s, the once-ubiquitous no-money-down mortgage has gone 
the way of the dinosaurs. Today, lenders expect borrowers to reach deep 
into their pockets and come up with a sizable down payment.
Calculate Your Down Payment
How much money will you have to have to qualify for a mortgage? Ide-
ally, 20 percent of the home’s purchase price. That threshold offers several 
benefits:
•	 Better chance of approval. Starting in the late 2000s, and in response 
to the subprime mortgage meltdown, lenders ratcheted up the re-
quirements for mortgages, requiring higher credit scores, bigger down 
payments, and proof that you’re likely to keep your job. Some lenders 
eliminated so-called piggyback loans (page 187), which let homebuy-
ers borrow part of their down payment as a second mortgage. If you 
can’t pony up 20 percent of your home’s purchase price, lenders may 
consider you at greater risk of defaulting on your mortgage, meaning 
you won’t be able to make payments. 
For creative ways to finance your home purchase, see page 186.

•	 Lower interest rates. When you can afford a down payment of 20 per-
cent or more, lenders see you as less of a risk, and your interest rate 
reflects this.
•	 No PMI. Lenders’ confidence in 20-percenters excuses those buyers 
from paying for private mortgage insurance, too. If you get a mort-
gage with less than 20 percent down, lenders require that you get PMI, 
which protects the bank from loss if you fail to repay your loan (see the 
box on page 146). Depending on your credit score, which measures 
your creditworthiness based on your financial history (page 39 tells 
you more about credit scores), and other factors, PMI costs from 0.5 to 
1 percent of your mortgage. 
•	 Lower payments. When you make a higher down payment, you bor-
row less money. And that means you have less to pay back—each 
month and over the life of the loan. Take a look at the table to see the 
difference a bigger down payment makes to monthly and lifetime pay-
ments when you take out a 30-year, fixed-rate loan to buy a $250,000 
home. Where the lender requires mortgage insurance, assume it’s 0.5 
percent. (For simplicity’s sake, also assume that all the loans below 
have a 5 percent interest rate.)

Some lenders advertise “no mortgage insurance” loans, which let you start with a 
down payment of less than 20 percent and don’t require you to buy PMI. In these 
cases, however, the lender usually buys the PMI itself—and you pick up the tab by 
paying a higher interest rate for the life of your loan. When you buy PMI outright, 
however, you can stop paying for that insurance once the equity in your home 
reaches 20 percent. So approach “no mortgage insurance” loans with caution. It 
may be cheaper in the long run to go for a loan that requires you to buy PMI you 
can cancel once you build up sufficient equity.

•	 Instant equity. One of the financial advantages of buying a home is 
building equity (see page 12), and a hefty down payment gives you a 
head start.
Coming Up with a Down Payment
For many first-time homebuyers, scraping together 20 percent of a home’s 
purchase price can be daunting. If you find that the house of your dreams 
costs $300,000, for example, you need $60,000 in cash to make a 20 per-
cent down payment. Not many people have that many greenbacks stuffed 
in their mattresses. It’s clear that it’s in your interest to pay 20 percent up 
front, but where can you get that kind of money? Here are some strategies.
Start saving 
Many first-time homebuyers save for years to accumulate a down pay-
ment. If you take this route, deduct a set amount from each paycheck and 
put it into a dedicated bank account. And if you get an income tax refund, 
Up To Speed
Private Mortgage Insurance
From a lender’s perspective, a lower down payment indicates a higher risk of de-
fault. In other words, lenders see a buyer who can afford a down payment of only 
5 percent as more likely to have trouble paying back his loan than a buyer who can 
put down 20 percent. To minimize their risk in writing such mortgages, most lend-
ers require private mortgage insurance (PMI), which protects the lender in case you 
default on your loan. PMI ensures that the lender recovers a specific percentage of 
the loan amount if you stop paying. 
Note that PMI protects the lender, not you. PMI won’t step in to make payments for 
you if you run into financial trouble. Instead, it minimizes the lender’s loss if he has 
to foreclose and ends up owning your house.
If your down payment is less than 20 percent, you’ll almost certainly have to buy 
PMI. The amount is figured as a percentage of the loan and typically costs about 
$55 a month per each $100,000 you borrow. So if you borrowed $200,000, you’d pay 
$1,320 in PMI in the first year.
PMI isn’t forever. You can request to end PMI payments when you accrue 20 percent 
equity in your home. (Your lender will probably require an appraisal of your home 
before canceling PMI.) And if you make your payments on time and are in good 
standing with your lender, the law requires cancellation of PMI when your equity in 
the home reaches 22 percent.

Finance Your Down Payment
147
don’t spend it—add it to your down payment account. Consider putting 
your savings into a money-market fund or a certificate of deposit (CD) to 
help it grow faster. Investment-grade bonds that mature in the year you 
want to buy are another good option (see Chapter 7 of Personal Investing: 
The Missing Manual for details on using bonds to achieve time-dependent 
financial goals).
Sell stuff
Look around. You may have items you can sell to put a few more dollars in 
your down-payment fund. Big-ticket items like an underused car, boat, or 
motorcycle can bring in a nice chunk of change. If you have investments 
like stocks and bonds, you might look into selling those (but don’t forget 
about the capital gains taxes you may have to pay). Even a garage sale of 
tossed-aside household items can raise a few hundred dollars. 
Convince mom and dad to help out
When you need a financial boost to come up with a down payment, fam-
ily members might be willing to contribute to your cause. And although 
you wouldn’t look that gift horse in the mouth, your lender certainly 
will—most banks require a copy of the gift check and a copy of your 
bank statement that shows you deposited the money into your account. 
Many also ask your donor to write a gift letter, an acknowledgement that 
the money was a gift and not a loan (the last thing your bank wants is a 
customer with two substantial outstanding loans). And sometimes the 
bank wants proof of the gift’s provenance, such as a copy of the giver’s 
bank statement showing that you benefactor deducted the amount 
from her checking account.
Borrow cash against your 401(k) plan
Ask your employer if you can borrow money against your 401(k) plan. As 
long as your payments stay on schedule, you won’t have to pay any taxes 
or penalties. Here’s a caveat, though: If you leave your job (whether you 
quit or get fired), the loan becomes due, usually within 60 days. If you bor-
rowed a significant amount, you may find it a struggle to pay all that money 
back at once.
Frugal living is another way to make your savings grow faster. You don’t have to 
subsist on mac-and-cheese dinners, but when you get the urge to splurge, ask 
yourself whether you’d rather make that impulse purchase or buy a home. Then 
put the money you’d have spent toward the down payment.

Chapter 6
148
Tap your individual retirement account
If you haven’t owned a home in the past two years, you can withdraw up 
to $10,000 from your IRA— without paying an early-withdrawal penalty—
and use that money to help purchase a home. (That $10,000 is the lifetime 
maximum you can take out for this purpose.) Both conventional and Roth 
IRAs qualify, although you have to pay income tax if you use a conven-
tional IRA or if your Roth IRA is less than 5 years old.
Alternatives to Paying 20 Percent 
Down
If you don’t have 20 percent to pay up front, you’re not necessarily con-
demned to a lifetime of renting. Although it’s tougher now to qualify for a 
loan with less than 20 percent down, you still have options. 
Low Down Payment Loans
During the housing boom of the mid-2000s, nearly a third of all first-time 
homebuyers paid little or nothing down to buy their homes. In the housing 
and financial crises that followed, these loans virtually disappeared. That’s 
not surprising: When home values slid, so did the equity in those homes. 
Many homeowners who’d recently bought a house with little or no mon-
ey down found that they owed more than their homes were worth (they 
had negative equity in the home, in other words). Defaults and foreclosures 
spiked, and lenders were saddled with properties worth less than what they 
had invested in them. A lower down payment means a riskier loan, and go-
ing into the second decade of the 21st century, lenders are less willing to 
take those kinds of risks. You can still find low down payment loans, but 
you’ll probably have to look around to find one that works for you.
Your best bet is a loan insured by the Federal Housing Authority (the FHA, 
an agency of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development). 
The FHA can help you get into a home if you don’t have tons of money for 
a down payment. The agency doesn’t make loans, it insures them. If you 
default on an FHA-insured loan, the FHA pays the entire amount you owe. 
That’s why lenders who wouldn’t accept a low down payment otherwise 
will make these loans when the FHA backs them. FHA-insured loans in-
clude a variety of fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages (Chapter 7 tells 
you all about these kinds of loans).  
If you qualify, you can get an FHA-insured loan for as little as 3.5 percent 
down. Income is the main determining factor—to qualify for an FHA loan, 
your mortgage payments can’t be more than 31 percent of your gross in-
come (that’s before taxes). There are also limits on the size of the loan, 

Finance Your Down Payment
149
determined by your geographic area; if your home is in a neighborhood 
of homes with a high median home price, the FHA bumps up your limit. 
As of this writing, FHA loan limits in most areas of the country are just over 
$271,000, although pricier areas, such as California, Hawaii, and parts of 
New York, can stretch that limit above $700,000.
There are a couple of caveats to an FHA-insured loan. You have to have 
mortgage insurance, which includes both an up-front fee of 1.5 percent 
to 2.5 percent of your loan, plus an annual premium of 0.5 percent, which 
your lender adds to your monthly payments. And if your credit score isn’t 
so hot (if it’s below 620, in other words), you’ll probably have to make a 
bigger down payment—up to 10 percent instead of the rock-bottom 3.5 
percent of most FHA loans. Finally, if you opt for a lower down payment, 
you’re borrowing more money, and that means that both your monthly 
payments and the total amount of your loan will be higher than if you 
shelled out more money up front. Page 180 gives you more details.
What does an FHA loan look like in terms of cold, hard cash? Take a look 
at the following table, which shows you how much money you’d have to 
bring to close on a house with an FHA loan versus a conventional loan with 
20 percent down; both loans have 30-year terms, with a fixed interest rate 
of 5 percent. (Keep in mind that the down payment and the initial mort-
gage insurance premium represent only part of a house’s closing costs, the 
total amount you pay to complete the transactions involved in buying a 
home. Chapter 9 gives you a complete rundown of closing costs.)

80-10-10 Loans
If you have enough money for a 10 percent down payment, you may 
qualify for an 80-10-10 mortgage, sometimes called a piggyback loan—
although these loans are rare nowadays. You come up with the equiva-
lent of a 20 percent down payment by paying 10 percent in cash and bor-
rowing the other 10 percent as a second mortgage—you take out two 
mortgages simultaneously, in other words. Because the first mortgage 
covers 80 percent of the home’s purchase price, you avoid having to get 
(and pay for) private mortgage insurance. Page 187 gives you the details 
on 80-10-10 loans.
Seller-Financed Second Mortgages
Some sellers don’t mind receiving a portion of a house’s sale price over 
time and may agree to finance a second mortgage for you. Normally, you 
pay off a seller-financed second mortgage over a term of 5 or 10 years. If 
you go this route, make sure that your lender okays a seller-financed sec-
ond mortgage and that the seller’s interest rate is at least as good as what 
you’d pay a traditional lender. See page 189 for details.

o matter how big your piggy bank, you aren’t going to find enough 
pennies in it to buy your new home. Most people don’t have the

Mortgage Basics
Talking with a mortgage broker can feel like conversing in a language you 
studied for a year in high school. You might get the gist of what he’s saying, 
but you might not fully understand what everything means. Don’t get lost 
in translation. Before you apply for a mortgage, make sure you understand 
the basics. 
What Is a Mortgage?
That’s easy. A mortgage is money you borrow to buy a house and pay back 
over time, with interest. Even though that’s how most people define the 
word mortgage, it isn’t technically a loan at all. It’s a document you give 
your lender so it can prove that it has a legal financial interest in your prop-
erty. In other words, a mortgage secures a loan by creating a lien, or a fi-
nancial claim, on your property. You’re the property’s legal owner, but you 
can’t sell it to anyone else until you repay the loan in full, releasing the lien.
There are two parties involved in a mortgage:
•	 The mortgagor (that’s you) borrows money from a lender and, in ex-
change, grants the lender a mortgage to ensure that you will repay 
the debt.
•	 The mortgagee (that’s your lender) holds your mortgage until you pay 
off the debt.
People sometimes confuse these terms, because it seems like the lender is 
the one doing the giving. After all, the lender is handing over the cash you 
need to buy the home.
To keep the terms straight, remember that you’re giving the lender the 
right to make a financial claim against your home if you fail to repay the 
money you borrowed (or if you sell the house). Your mortgage guarantees 
the loan.
A mortgage has two parts:
•	 A pledge of collateral. This means that you put up your house as se-
curity against the money you borrow.
•	 A promise to repay the loan. This means that you agree to pay back 
the loan in full.

Compare Mortgages and Other Financing Options
153
It’s important to understand both parts. When you put up your house as 
collateral, you grant the lender the right to seize the property if you go into 
default. That’s what a foreclosure is.
But the promise to repay is equally important. Many homeowners don’t 
realize that their mortgage allows the lender to sue for full repayment 
of the loan, even if the bank forecloses on the house or agrees to let you 
short-sell it (see page 124). The legally binding promise to repay is why it’s 
so important to understand how much you can reasonably afford to pay 
toward your mortgage each month before you apply for a loan. (Chapter 2 
tells you how to do just that.)
Interest Rate vs. APR
When you borrow money, you have to pay it back—no surprise there. And 
it’s also not surprising that the lender needs to make money on the trans-
action; otherwise, there’d be no reason to make loans. So lenders charge 
you a percentage of what you borrow, and that percentage is the loan’s 
interest rate. You pay interest for the privilege of borrowing the money.
Although the interest rate tells you what you’re paying to borrow the 
money, it doesn’t reflect the whole cost of the loan. That’s what the annual 
percentage rate, or APR, does. The APR bundles together all the costs as-
sociated with your loan—interest, upfront closing costs, and other costs 
and fees—and expresses the grand total as a yearly percentage. It’s what 
your loan and its associated fees cost you on an annual basis. The APR will 
always be higher than the interest rate, because it adds all other costs to 
that rate.
Some states use a deed of trust, rather than a mortgage, as the document that 
secures a real estate loan. Like a mortgage, a deed of trust secures the loan by cre-
ating a lien on your property. Unlike a mortgage, it involves three parties: a trustor 
(you), a beneficiary (the lender), and a trustee (a neutral third party, often an attor-
ney or title insurance company). The trustee holds temporary, limited title to your 
property until you pay the beneficiary in full. It’s still your house, but if you default 
on the loan, the trustee can transfer the title to the lender. If you stay current with 
your payments, the trustee cannot confiscate the title from you.

The APR was designed to make it easier for borrowers to compare loans. If 
you’re looking at loans with two slightly different interest rates, such as 5 
percent and 5.125 percent, the 5 percent loan looks like a better deal. But 
that loan may actually cost you more when you add in all the fees and total 
the cost of the loan over its life—the higher interest-rate loan could end up 
being cheaper. The following table, which compares APRs for two 30-year, 
fixed-rate, $250,000 loans, shows how that works:
Cost
Loan 1
Loan 2
Interest rate
5.125%
5% 
Monthly payment
$1,380.51
$1,342.05 
Discount points
0 points 
2 points (2% of $250,000) = $5,000 
Origination fee
2 % = $5,000
2.5% = $6,250
Other closing costs
$800
$1,250 
APR
5.3292%
5.4341%
As the table shows, even though Loan 2 has a slightly lower interest rate, its 
other costs are high enough that it’s the more expensive of the two loans. 
A loan’s APR is calculated over the life of the loan, usually 30 years. But 
most people sell their house and move on before those 30 years are up. 
So if you refinance or move within five years or so, a mortgage with high 
up-front costs may turn out to be even more expensive than the APR sug-
gests. The longer you live in  the home, the more your up-front costs are 
spread out over those years, and the less expensive they are in terms of the 
life of the loan.
The APR is less accurate for adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs, page 164) than it is 
for fixed-rate loans. That’s because it’s impossible to predict future interest rates. 
In 5 or 10 years, the 5 percent interest rate your ARM started out with may have 
increased to 6 or 7 percent (or it may have dropped to 4 percent).
Use APRs as a starting point for comparing mortgages. But be aware that not all 
lenders calculate APRs in precisely the same way. Page 215 tells you how to com-
pare loans using the Good Faith Estimates that lenders must give you.

Term 
The term of a loan is the length of time your lender allows you to pay it 
back. Along with the interest rate, lenders use the term of your loan to fig-
ure out how much you’ll pay each month. Most loans mature (that is, come 
due) at the end of their terms. An exception is a balloon loan (page 173). 
For a 10-year balloon loan, for example, the term may be 30 years (thus giv-
ing you low per-month payments), but the loan matures at 10 years, when 
you must repay the balance in a lump sum.
Many homeowners take out loans with a 30-year term. Stretching your 
payments over 360 months helps keep those monthly payments smaller. 
But because you’re borrowing the money for a longer period of time, you 
also pay more interest.
Amortization
If you looked up amortization in a dictionary, you’d learn that it means the 
process of paying back a loan, including interest, in regular installments 
over time. That’s a simple enough concept. But the way lenders calculate 
your payments isn’t quite so simple.
To lenders, a mortgage is an investment. And lenders expect a good re-
turn on that investment. Because they know that most people stay in a 
home for five to seven years, they calculate your monthly payments so 
that you’re paying a higher proportion of each payment toward interest 
than toward principal during the first half of the loan. For example, if you 
borrowed $250,000 at 5 percent interest over a 30-year term, you’d pay 
$1,342.05 each month for principal and interest. But those monthly pay-
ments aren’t evenly split. For about the first half of the loan—15 years in 
this case—more of your monthly payment goes toward the interest than 
the principal. These amounts gradually flip-flop as you continue to pay. 
The following amortization table shows how much of your monthly 
$1,342.05 goes toward principal and how much toward interest during the 
loan’s first year.
Page 176 has tips for choosing the right term for your loan.

As the table shows, by the end of the first year, you’ve paid $12,416.26 in 
interest, and just $3,688.34 went toward the principal. 
As the years go by, the amounts continue to adjust—each month, a little 
more of each payment goes toward principal and a little less toward in-
terest. Somewhere around the 16th year, principal and interest payments 
become close to equal. Then, for the second half of the loan, you pay more 
in principal than in interest.

If you made all of your monthly payments for 30 years, you’d pay back the 
$250,000 you originally borrowed, plus an additional $233,141.28 in inter-
est, for a grand total of $483,141.28. Although statistically it’s likely that 
you’ll sell your house, pay off the principal balance, and move on before 
you’ve made 360 monthly payments, it’s instructive to see the total cost of 
borrowing money for 30-year term—it adds up.
Points
When you shop for a mortgage, your broker or loan officer will talk about 
points. A point is equal to 1 percent of your loan. For a $250,000 loan, one 
point is $2,500.
You’ll encounter two kinds of points when you go to a lender:
•	 Origination points. This kind of point is a fee you pay your mortgage 
broker or loan officer for processing your mortgage. This fee is nego-
tiable, so discuss it with your lender. Unlike discount points, origina-
tion points aren’t tax deductible.
•	 Discount points. You might decide to use this kind of point to reduce 
your loan’s interest rate. Essentially, you pay part of your loan’s inter-
est up front, in one lump sum. The benefit? You pay a lower interest 
rate over the course of 30 years, and you can see from the following 
example how much interest adds up over time. One discount point 
typically reduces an interest rate between 0.125 and 0.25 percent. Be-
cause discount points are prepaid interest, you can deduct them from 
your taxes.
Over time, you can save a lot of money by paying a lower interest rate. 
Take a look at how much interest you’ll pay if you borrow $250,000 using a 
fixed-rate, 30-year loan.

Over 30 years, an extra one-half percentage point on the interest rate adds 
up to more than $27,500 in interest for this loan.  
Given their impressive benefits, should you pay discount points to lower 
your interest rate? The answer depends on two factors:
•	 Do you have the money? If you’re already stretching to come up with 
your down payment and closing costs, you may not have the cash to 
prepay interest.
•	 How long do you plan to live in the home? In general, the longer you 
live in a home, the more you can save by buying discount points. If you 
know you’re going to move after a couple of years, buying discount 
points probably isn’t worth it. On the other hand, if you plan to live in 
the same place for 10 years or longer, prepaying interest can save you 
a lot of money.
To make your decision easier, follow these steps:
1.	 Find out the monthly principal and interest payments for the full inter-
est rate and for the discounted interest rate. Your loan originator can 
give you these amounts, or you can use an online calculator like the 
one at www.mortgagecalculator.org. 
2.	 Subtract the lower, discounted payment from the full payment. That’s 
how much you’ll save each month. 
3.	 Divide the amount you’re paying for points by the monthly amount 
you’ll save. The result tells you how many months it will take to reach 
the break-even point—the point at which the money you saved each 
month adds up to enough to repay what you paid for points at closing.
For example, say your interest rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate loan for 
$250,000 is 5 percent. Your monthly principal and interest payment would 
be $1,342.05. Your loan officer tells you that by paying one point ($2,500), 
you can get a discounted interest rate of 4.75 percent. At the discounted 
rate, your monthly payment would be $1,304.12. Each month, you’d pay 
$37.93 less at the lower rate. 
When your mortgage broker or loan officer talks about points, ask how much that 
means in dollars. Two points may not sound like much—until you realize that the 
loan officer is talking about $5,000 on a $250,000 loan. If you decide to prepay 
interest, be sure you know how much it’ll cost you at the closing.

159
Because you paid $2,500 to get that discounted rate, you’d have to live in 
the house for 66 months—5 1/2 years—to break even. If you plan to stay in 
your home longer than that, you’ll start saving money. And the longer you 
live there, the more you save. If you lived in the home for 10 years, you’d 
save more than $6,100 in interest. If you stayed there for 30 years and paid 
off your mortgage on schedule, you’d save more than $13,600.
Escrow
When dealing with large amounts of money, it’s smart to work with some-
one you trust until all the dust has cleared and the transaction is settled. 
That’s what escrow is all about. Escrow means that a trusted, neutral third 
party holds money and legal documents for everyone involved in a house’s 
sale until the transaction closes. That neutral third party, called the escrow 
officer or escrow agent, may be an attorney or someone who works for 
an escrow or title company. Some states allow an escrow officer to con-
duct real estate closings; others require an attorney to do that job. Chapter 
13 explains the differences between how escrow states and non-escrow 
states conduct closings.
Depending on the terms of your loan, escrow may also come into play af-
ter closing. For most borrowers, the monthly payments include principal, 
interest, taxes, and insurance (PITI). Principal and interest go to the lender, 
and your taxes and insurance go into an escrow account. When these fees 
come due, the lender pays them from the escrow funds.
RESPA
Back in 1974, Congress passed the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act 
(RESPA) to protect consumers from unscrupulous goings-on in the real 
estate industry, including kickbacks and undisclosed fees. For example, a 
loan officer might steer you toward a particular title company without tell-
ing you that he got a commission for each new customer he referred. In 
that context, hidden costs and improper referral fees made it difficult for 
borrowers to compare loans. RESPA prohibits kickbacks and requires lend-
ers to provide certain information about the loan at different times during 
the loan process. 
Thanks to RESPA, when you apply for a mortgage, the lender must give you 
these documents within three days:
•	 Special Information Booklet. This booklet describes the steps in-
volved in buying a home and contains consumer information about 
the costs associated, including an explanation of the detailed HUD-1 
form you get on closing day (see page 325). 

Chapter 7
160
•	 Good Faith Estimate (GFE). This three-page document lists the terms 
of a loan and the charges you’re likely to pay at the closing (when you 
formally transfer the property). Because it’s an estimate, the actual 
charges may differ, but not by much, and that’s what the GFE was de-
signed for. To prevent nasty surprises at the closing, lender fees may 
not change from what’s stated in the GFE, and third-party fees may 
change, but by no more than 10 percent. 
The GFE also includes a handy table that compares the loan as quoted 
with one that offers lower up-front costs (but a higher interest rate) 
and one that offers a lower interest rate (and higher up-front costs). 
Page 215 tells you more about how to read your GFE.
•	 Mortgage Servicing Disclosure Statement. This document tells you 
whether the lender intends to service your loan itself or transfer (sell) 
the loan to another lender. 
You’ll get these disclosures between the time you apply for a loan and the 
closing: 
•	 Controlled Business Arrangement. Lenders sometimes make refer-
rals to other service providers—they may recommend a title insurance 
company, for example. If the lender owns or has any kind of interest in 
the service provider, this document informs you of that interest. 
•	 HUD-1 Settlement Statement. You’ll get a copy of this at closing, 
but the law says you’re entitled to get it 24 hours before your closing 
takes place. Ask for it in advance so you’ll have ample time to look it 
over. This form itemizes who pays for what—and how much—at the 
closing. It lists all the charges and credits for both you and the seller. 
It includes the home’s purchase price, the amount of money you are 
borrowing, how much you’ve already put down on the house (such 
as earnest money), and how much you’ll bring to the closing. Review 
your HUD-1 carefully to make sure it’s accurate. Page 325 shows you 
what’s in each section of this form.
Compare your HUD-1 statement to your Good Faith Estimate to make sure that 
estimated costs haven’t risen past their legal limit.

Compare Mortgages and Other Financing Options
161
Whether or not you get your HUD-1 a day in advance, you’ll get the fi-
nal copy at the closing. If part of your monthly payment will go into es-
crow to pay for recurring costs like taxes and insurance, you’ll also get 
an Initial Escrow Statement, which tells you how much you’re paying 
into escrow and for what. This statement breaks down estimated taxes, 
insurance premiums, and any other costs the lender collects, holds in 
escrow, and pays on your behalf for the first year of your loan.  
After the closing, RESPA wants your lender to stay in touch. So your lender 
must send you these documents (as applicable):
•	 Annual Escrow Statement. Your Initial Escrow Statement itemizes 
how much your lender sets aside for the first year of your loan to pay 
taxes, insurance, and other charges. But these costs tend to increase 
over time. Each year your lender must send you a new statement, so 
you can see how much you’ll pay and where that money is going.
•	 Servicing Transfer Statement. If the lender sells your loan (and you 
know whether this is likely from the mortgage servicing disclosure state-
ment described above), this statement notifies you that he’s done so.
The Mortgage Process
Before you take the mortgage plunge, know what you’re getting into. This 
section takes you behind the scenes to show you what happens to your 
mortgage application from the time you submit it to the time you’re clear 
to close.
Applying for a Loan
The journey to getting a mortgage begins with a single step—and you’re 
the one who has to take it. The mortgage process begins when you submit 
a loan application. Of course, preparing to take that initial step requires 
some work on your part. That’s why Chapter 8 tells you all about the pro-
cess of applying for a loan. 
After you’ve completed your application, you give it (along with support-
ing documentation, described below) to your mortgage broker or loan of-
ficer, who passes it on to the loan processor for the next phase.

Chapter 7
162
Processing Your Application
When you submit your loan application, a loan processor checks it over 
and verifies the information in it. She checks your credit history; orders 
an appraisal of the property; requests the title search; and contacts your 
employer, your landlord (if you currently rent), and financial institutions 
where you have accounts. Basically, assume that the loan processor checks 
every piece of information you supply.
Loan processing often takes a week or two. But delays can happen, espe-
cially as the loan processor waits to hear back from various sources. If the 
house appraiser has a backlog, for example, or if your vacationing boss is 
off climbing the Himalayas and can’t verify your employment, this phase 
might take longer. 
After the loan processor collects and verifies all the necessary information, 
she packages up your loan application with the appraisal and the prelimi-
nary title report and sends it on to a mortgage underwriter, who special-
izes in analyzing risk.
Analyzing Risk
Before your lender hands over the very large sum of money that enables 
you to buy your new home, it needs to assess whether the benefits of lend-
ing you that money outweigh the risk. Lenders make a profit from good 
loans, but they stand to lose a great deal from bad loans. They take the 
decision to make a loan—or not—very seriously. That’s where an under-
writer comes in. 
The mortgage underwriter, who may work for the lender or a company 
that does business with the lender, evaluates the information in your loan 
application and decides whether you’re an acceptable risk. Expect anoth-
er round of checking and verifications: The underwriter may double- or 
triple-check with the same people the loan processor contacted. It’s com-
mon for him to ask some pointed questions about recent account activity, 
like why you deposited an unusually large amount in your checking ac-
count on a particular date. Ultimately, the underwriter is the person who 
approves or denies your loan.
To speed up the application-review process, many lenders use automated under-
writing. That means a computer program, not a person, analyzes your application 
and approves or denies it. Afterward, a human underwriter reviews the support-
ing documentation to confirm that decision. Automated underwriting can shave 
several days off the underwriting phase of processing a loan.

Compare Mortgages and Other Financing Options
163
The underwriting phase usually takes a week or less, longer in a hot mar-
ket with lots of loan applications. The underwriter will probably send your 
loan officer a list of “conditions to close.” Usually, these are requests for fur-
ther or updated documentation, such as recent bank statements. After you 
supply the documentation, the underwriter gives the clear to close.
When your loan originator gets word that your loan is clear to close, she 
lets you know, coordinates among the parties to set up the closing, and 
draws up the documents you need to sign.
Types of Mortgages
If you’re the kind of person who has trouble deciding what to watch on TV 
or choosing an ice cream flavor, you might feel intimidated by the variety 
of mortgages you can choose from. Never fear. This section explains your 
options.
Fixed Rate Mortgage
A fixed-rate loan has an interest rate that doesn’t change over the life of 
the loan. If you get a 30-year fixed-rate loan with a 5.25 percent interest 
rate, for example, your interest rate remains 5.25 percent from the day you 
sign the loan papers until the day you pay off the mortgage.
With a fixed-rate loan, your monthly principal and interest payments re-
main the same, year in and year out, for as long as you have the loan. (Of 
course, if you make payments into escrow toward taxes and insurance, 
that portion of your monthly payment changes from one year to the next.) 
Fixed-rate loans are appealing because they’re stable and predictable, 
making it easier to budget for them.
Fixed-rate loans are a good choice if you plan to stay in your new home for 
several years. They’re a great choice when interest rates are low; if interest 
rates rise in the future, you’re unaffected. Of course, the reverse is also true: 
If interest rates are high when you get your loan, you’ll watch with envy 
if the rates drop. You still have an option at that point, though—you can 
refinance the loan at a lower rate.
Chapter 13 tells you what to expect at the closing.

Chapter 7
164
Adjustable Rate Mortgage
Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) have a variable interest rate—it’s tied 
to a specific financial index. The interest you pay fluctuates with the index; 
as the index goes up and down, so does your interest rate. Usually, an ARM 
has an initial, fixed interest rate for a set period of time, anywhere from 
a few months to several years. After that, the initial rate expires, and the 
index-tied adjustable rate takes over. Adjustment periods vary, but you’ll 
commonly find the rate set every six months or a year. 
You may see lenders refer to ARMs by number, which represents the initial 
fixed-rate period followed by the frequency of adjustments, so you might 
see a bank advertise a “5/1 ARM,” for example. The following table shows 
some common rate-adjustment schedules for ARMs.
ARM type
How it works
3/1
Fixed for three years (36 months), then adjusts annually for the rest of 
the loan’s term
3/3
Fixed for three years (36 months), then adjusts every three years for the 
rest of the loan’s term
5/1
Fixed for five years (60 months), then adjusts annually for the rest of the 
loan’s term
5/5
Fixed for five years (60 months), then adjusts every five years for the rest 
of the loan’s term
7/1
Fixed for seven years (84 months), then adjusts annually for the rest of 
the loan’s term
10/1
Fixed for ten years (120 months), then adjusts annually for the rest of 
the loan’s term
Fixed-rate loans are available in different terms—that is, for the amount of time 
you have to pay them back—such as 15 or 30 years. Page 176 has tips for choosing 
the term of your loan.
An ARM that has an initial fixed-rate period of 3 to 10 years, followed by an 
adjustable-rate period, is sometimes called a hybrid loan.

Compare Mortgages and Other Financing Options
165
Here’s an example of how ARMs work: Say you borrow $250,000 for a 
30-year term with a 3/1 ARM that has an initial interest rate of 5 percent. 
The principal and interest portion of your monthly payment is $1,342.05. 
Three years down the road, that initial rate expires, and you get a new rate 
that applies to the money you still owe. So say your rate goes up a point, 
to 6 percent. At the new rate, your monthly principal and interest pay-
ments become $1,498.88, an increase of $156.83 a month. If the interest 
rate takes a bigger jump, so would your payment. If your new rate is 7.5 
percent, for example, your new principal and interest payment would be 
$1,748.04—over $400 more each month than what you paid during the 
first three years.
Interest rates also go down, of course. When that happens, your month-
ly principal and interest payments drop, too. If the first adjustment low-
ers your interest rate from 5 percent to 4 percent, for example, your new 
monthly principal and interest payment is $1,193.54, saving you $148.51 
a month.
How your lender determines your rate
Two factors work together to determine the adjustable part of an ARM 
rate:
•	 The index, which is a measure of interest rates in general.
•	 The margin, which is the amount your lender adds to the index rate to 
come up with your rate.
To set your rate, the lender starts with the current rate of a particular in-
dex and then adds some percentage points (the margin). Although ARM 
margins can vary from one lender to another, the margin usually doesn’t 
change for the life of your loan. When your lender adds the margin to the 
current index rate, the result is called the fully indexed rate, which is the 
adjusted rate on your loan. If the index your lender uses is currently at 2 
percent and your loan’s margin is 3 percent, your fully indexed rate is 5 
percent.
Your lender can tie your ARM’s rate to one of many different indexes. Mostly 
likely, however, the lender will use one of the three below, which together 
account for about 80 percent of ARM indexes:
•	 London Inter Bank Offered Rates (LIBOR). This international in-
dex averages the interest rate on dollar-denominated deposits, also 
known as Eurodollars, traded between banks in London. Most lenders 
use the LIBOR rate that was current 45 days before your scheduled in-
terest rate change date. 

Chapter 7
166
•	 11th District Cost of Funds Index (COFI). This index reflects the inter-
est rate paid by savings institutions in the 11th federal district (institu-
tions headquartered in Arizona, California, or Nevada). 
•	 Constant Maturity Treasury (CMT). This index is based on the aver-
age yield of different U.S. Treasury securities adjusted to a one-year 
maturity. 
Rate caps
When you start paying back an ARM, you know what your interest rate is 
(along with its associated monthly principal and interest payments), now 
and for the initial, fixed-rate term of the loan. So if you take out a 5/1 ARM 
with an initial interest rate of 5 percent, you know that your rate will stay at 
5 percent for 60 months’ worth of mortgage payments. But what happens 
when month 61 rolls around? No one can predict what interest rates will 
be so far in the future—what if they’ve soared into double digits?
The LIBOR and CMT indexes both respond quickly to economic changes, which 
means rates tied to these indexes move up and down faster than COFI. COFI lags 
behind market interest rates, so ARMs tied to this index rise (and fall) more slowly 
than rates in general. This lag is good for you when rates are rising (your rate rises 
more slowly than those tied to other indexes), but not so good when rates are 
falling.

Most ARMs have rate caps that prevent your rate from rising (or falling) too 
far, too fast. This rate cap restricts the interest-rate change either from one 
adjustment period to the next or over the life of the loan:
•	 Periodic cap. This cap limits how much your rate can go up or down 
from one adjustment period to the next. A typical periodic cap is 2 to 
3 percent. 
•	 Lifetime cap. This cap limits how high your interest rate can go over 
the life of the loan. For example, if you start off with a rate of 5.25 per-
cent and your lifetime loan cap is 6 percent, the highest rate you will 
ever pay is 11.25 percent.
Caps work both ways, slowing or limiting changes to your interest rate 
when the index rate drops—not just when it rises. 
It’s even possible for the index to drop or stay the same, while your in-
terest rate rises. This is thanks to a practice called carryover. If your loan 
is subject to carryover, here’s what happens: Say the interest rate takes a 
jump, but your periodic cap keeps your rate from jumping quite so high. 
Then, at the next adjustment, index rates have declined slightly. But when 
you get your adjusted rate, it didn’t drop as far as you expected—it may 
even have increased. When rates went up, your cap held your rate below 
what it would have been if your rate had increased to the fully indexed 
rate. Because the cap held down your interest rate, your lender carries over 
whatever increase it couldn’t apply during the earlier adjustment to the 
next adjustment. 
Here’s an example. Say your initial interest rate is 5 percent, with a 2 per-
cent periodic cap—that means your rate can’t rise more than 2 percent 
from one adjustment period to the next. When it’s time to calculate your 
new rate, interest rates have risen 3 percent. Because of your 2 percent 
cap, your rate rises only 2 points, to 7 percent. So far, so good. At the next 
adjustment, however, interest rates stay the same—but your rate goes up. 
That’s because the current index rate is now within your loan’s 2 percent 
cap; your rate can rise another percentage point, all the way to 8 percent, 
because it didn’t rise the full amount the previous year. That’s carryover.
Before you take out an ARM, figure out what your monthly principal and interest 
payments would be at the maximum rate. (Use an ARM calculator like the one at 
Interest.com: http://tinyurl.com/yjzloge.) If you can’t afford payments that high, 
don’t go with the ARM.

Chapter 7

Convertible ARMs
Some people start out with an ARM and later decide that they prefer the 
comfort of knowing what their principal and interest payments will be 
from one year to the next. When that happens, you have a couple of op-
tions: You can refinance, or, if you have a convertible ARM, you can convert 
your loan from a variable-rate to a fixed-rate loan without having to go 
through the whole refinancing process. 
Your agreement with your lender may include a clause that lets you con-
vert your ARM to a fixed-rate loan at designated times. If you decide to 
convert, your lender sets the fixed rate using a formula spelled out in your 
loan documents. If you opt for a convertible ARM, be aware that you might 
spend more money up front than for a regular ARM. You may also have to 
pay a fee to convert the loan.
Things to watch out for
If you’re shopping for an ARM, you’ll encounter a bewildering variety of 
options. There are some things you definitely don’t want your loan to have; 
this section tells you what they are.
Negative amortization
You make your 3required payment each month, so it’s reasonable to as-
sume that, over time, the amount you owe the lender is decreasing, right? 
Usually, yes, even though you initially pay far more toward interest than 
toward your principal (page 155 explains how that works). But in some 
cases, even though you make those payments faithfully, your balance ac-
tually increases. You can end up owing the bank more at the end of the 
year than you did at the beginning, even though you made every required 
payment on time.
Some ARMs have a payment cap, but that’s not the same as a rate cap. A payment 
cap limits the dollar amount that your monthly payment can increase at each 
adjustment (as opposed to limiting your interest rate). For example, if your loan 
has a payment cap of 10 percent, your monthly payment won’t increase more than 
10 percent over your previous payment, no matter how much interest rates have 
increased. So if your payment is $1,300 a month, you won’t pay more than $1,430 a 
month after the next adjustment. 
Payment caps may sound like a good thing, but they’re not. Stay away from them. 
If your ARM has a payment cap, it may not come with a periodic rate cap—and 
when interest rates increase, your payments aren’t keeping up with them, and that 
can lead to negative amortization. Negative amortization is a bad thing, as you can 
read later in this section.

169
The culprit is something called negative amortization. As page 155 ex-
plains, when you pay your principal and interest each month, you amor-
tize your loan—that is, you gradually pay it off according to a set schedule. 
Negative amortization means that the balance increases rather than de-
creases as you make your payments. This can happen when your ARM has 
a payment cap (page 168) but no periodic rate cap (page 203). 
Say your loan has a payment cap of 10 percent but no rate cap. At a 4 
percent interest rate, you pay $1,200 a month for principal and interest. At 
the next adjustment period, your interest rate jumps to 6 percent, which 
increases what you owe each month to about $1,500. But thanks to the 
rate cap, what you owe is not what you pay. Your 10 percent payment cap 
holds your adjusted payment to $1,320 (the $1,200 you were paying plus 
10 percent, or $120). Looks like you’re saving money, right? You’re not. The 
$180 you’re not paying each month gets added to your principal. Instead 
of decreasing, your principal balance is increasing. In other words, the un-
paid interest gets rolled into the balance of your loan—and you end up 
paying interest on the interest you haven’t yet paid. That makes your loan 
balance shoot up, along with the total interest you owe.
Some ARMs include a cap on negative amortization, which limits the total 
amount you can owe—usually topping out at 110 to 125 percent of the 
amount you originally borrowed. If your balance increases to that point, 
the lender recalculates your monthly payment amount so that you fully 
repay the loan over the remaining term. Expect your payments to take a 
big jump, because now you’re paying back an amount of up to 25 percent 
more than you borrowed. 
Teaser rates
Some ARMs advertise super-low, super-attractive initial interest rates. But 
these low starter rates, called teaser or discounted rates, may come at a 
high price. A teaser rate is lower than the lender’s current fully indexed rate 
(page 165) and looks like a terrific deal. But look closely: To get the teaser 
rate, you may have to pay a hefty fee (in the form of discount points, page 
157), and after the teaser rate expires, your interest rate (along with your 
monthly payments) will probably take a big jump.
To limit negative amortization, increase your monthly payments beyond your 
payment cap, if you have one. Ask your lender what the fully amortized monthly 
payment is—the full amount you need to pay to keep up with the interest you 
owe—and pay that.

Chapter 7
170
If you’re thinking about a discounted ARM with a teaser rate, make sure 
you know:
•	 When the discounted rate expires
•	 What the fully indexed rate is
•	 How much you’d pay each month at the fully indexed rate
Depending on how the loan will change after the teaser rate expires, you 
may find that the discount points you pay up front don’t reduce the overall 
cost of the loan enough to make it worthwhile.
Prepayment penalties
Some ARMs make you pay special fees or penalties if you pay off your loan 
early, say within the first 3 to 5 years of the loan. Lenders impose two kinds 
of prepayment penalties:
•	 Soft prepayment penalties mean that you pay fees if you refinance 
your loan (thereby paying off your current loan), but not if you sell your 
home.
•	 Hard prepayment penalties charge you fees if you pay off the loan ear-
ly for any reason: either through refinancing, by selling the property, or 
because of a windfall (such as an inheritance).
Prepayment penalties exist because lenders don’t want you signing up for 
an ARM with a low teaser rate, only to turn around and refinance when 
your rate is about to adjust upward. So the penalties can be hefty, such as 
six months’ worth of interest on your remaining balance (in some cases, it’s 
80 percent of the loan’s balance). For example, say you borrow $250,000 
using a 5/1 ARM with an initial rate of 5 percent. After 32 months, you de-
cide to refinance. At that point, your balance is $239,740. On that balance, 
six months’ worth of interest would cost you just under $6,000!
Who’s a good candidate for an ARM?
If you plan to stay in your new home for just a few years, an ARM can be 
a good choice. Their initial rates are lower than fixed-rate mortgages, so if 
you’re likely to move in a few years, you benefit from the ARM’s lower rate. 
(Find out if there’s a prepayment penalty and, if so, how much.)
Prepayment penalties are legal under federal law, but some states don’t allow 
them. Talk to your lender or a real estate attorney to get the scoop for your state.

171
ARMs can also be a good choice for first-time homebuyers who plan to buy 
a starter home and trade up to a larger home later. Their lower initial rates 
can make ARMs a good way to enter the housing market. You get a good 
rate, and your initial monthly payments are low.
Questions to ask
If you’re considering an ARM, make sure you get the answers to these 
questions:
•	 How long does the initial interest rate last? It’s important to know 
this, because it tells you when your rate will start to change. You don’t 
want to be caught by surprise with a rate that jumps unexpectedly.
•	 To what index is the interest rate tied? When you know which index 
your lender uses to determine the loan’s rate, you can check how the 
index has performed over the past year and what its current rate is. You 
can also get a sense of whether the index moves quickly with market 
rates or lags behind them.
•	 What’s the interest rate’s margin? When you know this number, you 
can look at current index rates and get a sense of what your interest 
rate would be if your initial rate expired today.
•	 Does the loan have a periodic interest rate cap? What is it? As page 
167 explains, periodic caps protect you from too-sharp increases in 
your interest rate from one adjustment period to the next. The lower 
the cap, the more restricted the increase. 
•	 Can rate increases carry over from one adjustment period to the 
next? Page 167 tells you what carryover is and why you should avoid 
it if you can.
•	 How much can the rate increase in the first adjustment period? 
Some loans allow the first adjustment to ignore the periodic cap—
which means you could be facing a huge increase in your monthly 
principal and interest payments if the rate has increased.

RateWatch (http://tinyurl.com/y87jaqa).
Loan officers sometimes increase their commission by padding the index margin. 
If the margin is higher than about 2.5 percent, ask the lender to decrease it.

Chapter 7
172
•	 What is the lifetime cap for the loan’s interest rate? Use the lifetime 
cap to figure out what your maximum monthly principal and interest 
payments would be to make sure you can afford to continue paying if 
rates skyrocket.
•	 Can this loan be subject to negative amortization? Don’t get into 
any situation where meeting your monthly payment obligations can 
increase your balance.
•	 Is there a penalty for prepaying the loan? Many ARMs come with 
some kind of penalty for paying off the loan early. Know how long the 
penalty is in effect, whether the penalty is hard or soft, and how much 
it would cost to pay off the loan ahead of time.
Option ARM
Everyone likes to have choices. And, on the surface, that’s what an option 
ARM appears to offer. With an option ARM, you can choose to pay any of 
four amounts each month. But beware: These loans can lead to negative 
amortization (page 169). 
The list of your payment options appears below. It shows what your 
monthly payment options are on a 30-year option ARM, from the smallest 
payment to the highest:
1.	 Minimum payment. This amount is less than the interest you owe 
for the month. Choosing it increases your loan’s balance (see negative 
amortization, page 169). Avoid it.
2.	 Interest-only payment. This amount keeps you up to date on your 
interest but doesn’t pay anything toward your principal, so your loan’s 
balance stays the same. (Page 174 explains why interest-only pay-
ments are a bad idea for most borrowers.)
3.	 Fully amortized. This amount pays both principal and interest accord-
ing to the loan’s amortization schedule, so you’re on track to pay off 
the loan fully in 30 years. It decreases the loan’s balance.
4.	 Accelerated payment. This amount pays the principal and interest 
you currently owe plus some extra money that helps you pay off the 
loan faster—for example, on a 15-year schedule instead of a 30-year 
schedule. It decreases your loan’s balance faster than option 3.
If you always take option 3 or 4—if you make payments high enough to 
cover both principal and interest each and every month—then an option 
ARM isn’t a problem. It’s the first two options that get homeowners in 
trouble. Neither lets you build any equity in your home, and option 1 can 
leave you owing more than what you initially borrowed, even after years 
of payments!

173
For most borrowers, option ARMs are bad news. If you can handle options 
3 and 4, you don’t need an option ARM—take out a regular ARM or a fixed-
rate loan. If options 1 and 2 look like the only way you can buy the home, 
you’re probably trying to buy a home you can’t afford. Turn back to Chap-
ter 2 and figure out whether you need to scale back your expectations.
Balloon Loan
A balloon loan is fixed-rate loan whose payments are calculated for a 30-
year term, but whose true term is far less. After a set period of time (often 3, 
5, 7, or 10 years), the loan matures, and you owe the entire balance in one 
lump sum. To pay, you have to sell the home, refinance, or win the Lotto.
Balloon loans offer a low interest rate, so they can sometimes be a good 
alternative to an ARM. If you’re confident you can sell or refinance when 
the balance comes due, you may find that a balloon loan’s lower rate saves 
you money over fixed-rate and ARM options.
Two-Step Loan
A two-step loan is an ARM that starts off with a fixed rate for a specified 
period of time, usually 5 or 7 years (that’s step 1). Then the lender applies 
a new interest rate, based on current market rates, to the remaining bal-
ance (that’s step 2). You might see these mortgages referred to as 5/25 and 
7/23 loans. The first number reflects the number of years in step 1, and the 
second shows the number of years in step 2.
Two-step mortgages typically have a cap on how much the interest rate 
can go up at the end of the initial period. Even with a cap, however, it’s 
possible that your rate could skyrocket if interest rates climb sharply dur-
ing the first step. For example, if you borrowed $250,000 in a 5/25 two-step 
mortgage with an interest rate of 5 percent in step 1 and a 5 percent cap, 
your principal and interest payments would be about $1,342 a month for 
the first 60 months. If interest rates climb steadily during those five years, 
and your rate adjusts to reach its full 5 percent cap, your new interest rate 
jumps to 10 percent. After five years of payments at 5 percent interest, 
your loan’s balance would now be $229,572. At the new interest rate of 
10 percent, your monthly principal and interest payment would shoot up 
to $2,015. You’d have to come up with an additional $673 each and every 
month to keep repaying the loan.
With a two-step loan, the lender sometimes has the option to call the loan due 
after 7 or 10 years with 30 days notice. Read your contract carefully and make sure 
you understand its terms.

Chapter 7
174
So why do people go for two-step mortgage loans? For several reasons:
•	 Interest rates are high, and you expect them to drop in time for step 2. 
•	 In step 1, a two-step loan tends to have a lower rate than a fixed-rate 
loan. So if you expect to sell your home before step 2 kicks in, you get 
the benefit of the lower initial rate.
•	 A two-step loan can be a stepping-stone for people who don’t current-
ly meet the income level lenders require for a fixed-rate loan. If you’re 
sure that your income will increase enough in the next 5 to 7 years that 
you can make the higher payments in step 2, a two-step loan may get 
you into the home you want.
Interest-Only Loan
During the housing boom of the mid-2000s, interest-only loans were all 
the rage. As the name suggests, you pay only your loan’s interest—but 
not its principal—for a specified period of time (usually 5, 10, or 15 years). 
When interest-only loans were popular, house prices were rising quickly, 
so it seemed like all a homeowner had to do was buy a home and wait 
for the price to go up, and voilà—instant equity. You didn’t have to wor-
ry about reducing the principal, the reasoning went, because the house 
would increase in value so quickly that the loan-to-value ratio worked in 
the homeowner’s favor, without the homeowner’s having to pay for it. 
In that super-hot housing market, interest-only loans seemed like a great 
way to buy a home. With prices rising so fast, it was difficult for many 
homebuyers—especially first-time buyers—to come up with the money 
to buy a home. Enter the interest-only loan. Because borrowers paid only 
interest for a set period (such as 5 or 10 years), payments were lower than 
they would have been for a traditional loan. Those lower payments meant 
homebuyers could buy more expensive houses. And increasing housing 
prices, everyone trusted, would work in their favor, reducing the amount 
borrowed in relation to the home’s value.
It was fun while it lasted, but when the housing boom did an abrupt U-turn 
and became the housing slump, interest-only loans became a problem for 
many homeowners. Instead of gaining equity through rising prices, homes 
lost equity as the market cooled off. Homeowners with interest-only loans 
had done nothing to reduce the principal of their loans, so even those 
It’s always risky to count on future income when you’re making plans now. Don’t 
use a two-step mortgage to buy a more expensive house than you can afford.

175
who’d been making regular monthly payments for years owed their lend-
ers the same amount they borrowed. As prices continued to slide, many of 
these homeowners found themselves with negative equity and couldn’t 
afford to sell their homes—they were worth less than they owed on the 
mortgage.
Here’s how an interest-only loan works: If you borrow $250,000 with an 
interest rate of 5 percent and a term of 30 years, your initial monthly pay-
ments are $1,041.67—about $300 less each month than a fully amortized 
30-year fixed-rate loan at 5 percent. (Fully amortized means that you’re 
paying both principal and interest in an amount that will repay the loan 
plus interest over the life of the loan.) Saving $300 a month looks good, 
right? The problem is, you have to pay back the principal at some point. 
When your interest-only period is up, the lender amortizes the loan for 
whatever term is left on it. If your interest rate remained at 5 percent, your 
payments would increase sharply, depending on how long you’d been 
paying just interest. Instead of $1,041.67 in interest-only payments, you’d 
be paying one of these amounts:
Years remaining

$1,461.48

$1,649.89

$1,976.98
But most interest-only loans aren’t fixed rate; they’re ARMs. The interest 
rate may vary during the interest-only period (on some loans, the rate ad-
justs every month), or the loan switches to an annual variable rate after the 
interest-only period. If your initial interest rate of 5 percent has jumped to 
7.5 percent when you start making fully amortized payments, for example, 
you’ll be in for some serious payment shock: After 10 years of interest-only 
payments of $1,041.67 each month, you suddenly have to start paying 
nearly three times that—just over $2,967. Ouch.
If you borrowed $250,000 with a 5 percent interest rate and a 30-year term, 
the following table gives a snapshot what your financial picture would look 
like after 10 years, comparing an interest-only loan with a fixed-rate loan:

When you’re thinking about making payments from one month to the 
next, that $300 savings on the interest-only loan looks good. When you 
look at the bigger picture, though, you can see how an interest-only loan 
costs you money—a lot of it. After 10 years, you’ve paid more than $10,500 
more in interest than with a fixed-rate loan—and you haven’t gained a 
penny in equity. Compare that to the more than $46,000 you gained in 
equity making by making fully amortized payments on the fixed-rate loan.
Bottom line: Interest-only loans are expensive and risky. You’ll write a 
smaller number on your monthly checks, but over time you’ll pay a lot 
more. And if home values decline, as it did in many cities in 2008, you could 
have paid all that extra interest only to end up with negative equity.
Bridge Loan
If you’re selling your current house because you want to buy your dream 
home, it would be ideal if you could hold the two closings in quick suc-
cession: sell the house you own now, and then use the money you made 
in the sale to help pay for your new home. But with all the variables in 
any given real estate transaction, things often don’t line up that smoothly. 
What if you have to close on the home you’re buying before you can sell 
your current home? That’s what bridge loans are for.
A bridge loan is a short-term loan—six months is common—that bridges 
the time between when you purchase a new home and when you sell your 
current one. If you already have a firm purchase-and-sale agreement on 
the house you’re selling, you can probably get an unsecured bridge loan. If 
you don’t have an agreement for your current home, you can get a secured 
bridge loan in the form of a second mortgage on that home.
Bridge loans are often interest-only loans with high rates, so make sure 
that you’re not going to get into financial trouble trying to pay your old 
mortgage, your new mortgage, and a bridge loan for an extended period 
of time. You may have to make arrangements to rent out your old place—
or you may decide to wait until you’ve got an offer on your current home 
before you go house hunting.
Choose the Term of Your Mortgage
Although it may feel like you’ll be paying back your mortgage forever, the 
loan does have a definite lifetime, its term. Lenders use a loan’s term to 
amortize the mortgage (page 155), figuring out how much you need to 
pay each month in order to repay the loan, plus interest, over that term. In 
general, the longer the term, the lower your monthly payments. However, 
a longer term means that you’re borrowing the lender’s money for a longer 
period of time—and that means you end up paying more interest.

Shorter Term or Longer Term?
Mortgages commonly come in terms of 15, 20, 30, 40, 45, and even 50 years. 
Fifteen- and 30-year terms are among the most popular, although in mar-
kets where homes are more expensive than the national average, up to a 
quarter of loans may have terms of 40 years or longer, thanks to the way 
these loans lower borrowers’ monthly principal and interest payments.
In general, shorter-term loans have lower interest rates, and rates increase 
as the terms do. The following table compares the cost of different terms—

In general, a shorter term lets you build equity faster. With each payment, 
more money goes toward the principal, so over the term of the loan you 
pay less interest and reduce the principal balance faster. For example,

Although the table shows fixed-rate loans for the purposes of comparison, most 
longer-term loans (those for more than 30 years) are ARMs. For example, many 
loans with 50-year terms are 5/1 ARMs; you pay a steady, fixed interest rate for the 
first five years of the loan, and after that the rate adjusts annually—and you can 
count on a lot of interest rate ups and downs over 45 years.

If the home’s value remains the same over those five years, you’ll have 
gained just over $65,465 in equity with the 15-year loan. That’s $45,037 
more than the $20,428 in equity you’d accumulate with the 30-year loan. 
Of course, to accumulate that extra equity, you have to be able to afford a 
higher monthly payment—about $570 more each month in this example. 
Lower, more affordable monthly payments are the main reason borrowers 
choose a longer-term loan. But as the tables show, interest adds up quickly 
with longer-term loans, even over a relatively short period of time.
If you’re trying to decide between a 15-year and a 30-year loan, your first 
consideration will probably be how much you can afford to pay each 
month. Many people choose 30-year loans because they’re willing to make 
the trade-off of paying more money in the long run for lower monthly pay-
ments now. They’ll sell or refinance long before the loan’s term is up, they 
figure, so they won’t pay the full interest of the 30-year term.
On the other hand, if your goal is to build equity faster or to pay off the loan 
and own your home outright as quickly as possible—and you can swing 
the higher monthly payments—you should consider a 15-year mortgage.
Reducing Your Loan’s Term
Many homeowners choose a 30-year mortgage, thinking that they want 
the lower payments so they can free up extra money for day-to-day ex-
penses. After a few years in the home, however, your priorities may  change; 
instead of lower monthly payments, you want to build equity faster or pay 
off your loan earlier to save on interest charges.
You can do that by making extra payments toward the amount you bor-
rowed, called paying down the principal. These extra payments reduce 
the term of your loan, which means you build equity faster. Each time you 
make an extra payment to reduce the principal, you also reduce the bal-
ance on which you’re paying interest—and that means you pay less inter-
est over the life of the loan. In fact, by paying one extra month’s worth of 
If you’d like a 15-year loan but are nervous about making the higher monthly pay-
ments, look for a lower-priced home. Because looking only at monthly payments 
can make a 30-year loan seem more attractive, some homebuyers are tempted 
to overspend, thinking they can get more house for less money. If a 15-year loan 
looks too expensive, you may be home-shopping in a higher price range than you 
can really afford.

principal and interest each year, you can shave years off your loan—and 
save tens of thousands of dollars in interest. For example, say you took 
out a 30-year, fixed rate loan to borrow $250,000 at 5 percent interest. By 
making the equivalent of one extra monthly payment each year, you pay 
off your mortgage nearly five years early and save more than $42,000 in 
interest:

$190,722.07 
You can make this extra monthly payment by mailing in an extra check 
once a year (include a letter saying that the entire amount is to go toward 
your loan’s principal), or you can divide your monthly payment by 12 and 
add that amount to your principal and interest payment each month. 
That’s where the second monthly payment amount in the table came 
from: When you divide $1,342.05 by 12, you get $111.84 (rounded up to 
the nearest penny). Adding $111.84 to each monthly payment makes the 
new monthly payment $1,453.89. So over the course of a year, you made 
the equivalent of 13 payments, not the usual 12. 
Making extra payments toward the principal can help you build equity 
faster while allowing you some flexibility. During times when you have ex-
tra money, you can use it to pay down the principal and build equity faster. 
But if you need to do some belt-tightening, you can go back to your regu-
lar payment schedule. Before you start sending in extra payments, though, 
check with your lender to make sure there’s no prepayment penalty. 
You may see ads for “biweekly loans.” These are loans that you pay every other 
week instead of once a month. Over the course of a year, you make 26 biweekly 
payments (each at half the amount of your full monthly payment) instead of 12 
monthly payments. This adds up to the equivalent of one extra monthly payment 
each year, helping you pay off the loan faster. Paying off the loan faster is a good 
idea, but you don’t need to convert to a biweekly loan to do it. These programs 
charge a conversion fee and, sometimes, additional administrative fees. There’s no 
reason to pay them when you can do the same thing yourself for free.

Government Financing Programs
Uncle Sam can help you buy your home if you meet certain qualifications. 
There are government-sponsored financing programs for first-time home-
buyers, people in service professions, and those who need extra help to 
qualify for financing. This section gives you a brief overview.
FHA-Insured Loans
Since 1934, the Federal Housing Authority, part of the U.S. Department of 
Housing and Urban Development, has been helping Americans achieve 
their dreams of home ownership. The FHA doesn’t make the loans itself; 
it insures loans offered by financial institutions, like banks and mortgage 
companies. FHA-insured loans offer homebuyers these benefits:
•	 Lower down payments. Unlike loans that aren’t insured by the FHA, 
which require an initial down payment of 10 or even 20 percent of the 
purchase price, if you qualify for an FHA-insured loan, you can buy a 
home with as little as 3.5 percent down. Instead of having to come up 
with a down payment of $20,000 or $40,000 to buy a $200,000 home, 
for example, you can qualify for a loan with a down payment as low as 
$7,000.
•	 Lower closing costs. As Chapter 9 outlines, the costs associated with 
closing, especially from fees associated with your loan, can run to 
thousands of dollars—and that’s on top of the down payment. With an 
FHA-insured loan, you can roll many of the closing costs into the loan 
and pay them back over time, so you need less cash in hand at closing.
•	 Easier loan qualification. Because the FHA insures your loan, lend-
ers are more confident about lending to you. You don’t need a stellar 
credit history to qualify. 
•	 Better interest rates. If your credit score isn’t great, you may get a bet-
ter rate through an FHA-insured loan than you could otherwise.
To qualify for an FHA-insured loan, you have to meet these conditions:
•	 You meet the residence and age criteria. You must be a legal resi-
dent of the United States with a valid Social Security number and be of 
legal age to obtain a mortgage in your state.
•	 You’ll live in the home you’re buying. These loans aren’t for investors 
or second-home buyers. You have to be buying a primary residence, 
but it can have up to four units (you can rent out the others as long as 
you live in one).

181
•	 You meet standard credit guidelines. This is what the FHA looks for 
in an applicant:
—
— Steady employment for the past two years or longer, preferably 
with the same employer
—
— Stable or increasing income during those two years
—
— A monthly payment amount that’s no more than 30 percent of 
your household’s pre-tax income
—
— No bankruptcies during the past two years or foreclosures during 
the past three years
—
— A credit score that’s acceptable to the lender
—
— The ability to qualify for the loan you’re applying for and pay pri-
vate mortgage insurance (PMI, page 146)
•	 Your loan amount falls within FHA limits. There’s a cap on how much 
you can borrow with an FHA-insured loan. That cap varies by area, but 
for most regions it’s currently $271,050 for a single-family home. To 
find out what the cap is for your area, go to http://tinyurl.com/2x4vsm.
Most lenders who work with FHA-insured loans offer terms of 15 or 30 
years, and you can choose from fixed-rate loans or ARMs. The interest rate 
varies by lender and with your credit history and other financial informa-
tion. To find a lender who’ll work with you to get an FHA-insured loan, go 
to www.hud.gov/buying/localbuying.cfm. 
Buying a fixer-upper
If you’re thinking about buying an older house and fixing it up to make it 
your home, the FHA has a program for you. HUD’s 203(k) program lets you 
take out a loan that covers the cost of both buying a primary residence and 
fixing it up. 
For the home to be considered a primary residence, you must live there for at least 
12 months after you buy it.
HUD doesn’t impose a minimum credit score to qualify for an FHA-insured loan, 
but individual lenders may look for a credit score of 620 or higher to minimize their 
risk. If you have no credit history at all, you may still qualify for an FHA-insured 
loan. The lender will look at your past rent payments, utility bills, auto insurance 
payments, and so on to see whether you pay them reliably.

Chapter 7
182
Here’s how the 203(k) program for fixer-uppers works:
1.	 When you find a home you want to buy, make your purchase offer con-
tingent on getting a 203(k) loan. 
2.	 Find a lender approved by the FHA to make this sort of loan and sub-
mit a proposal that details the scope of the repairs and improvements, 
along with cost estimates.
3.	 Arrange to have an appraisal done. The appraiser estimates what the 
home’s value will be after you complete renovations.
4.	 The lender processes your loan application. If you qualify, the loan 
covers the purchase price, the remodeling costs, you submitted, and 
some of your closing costs, plus a contingency reserve of 10 to 20 per-
cent of the total remodeling costs (to cover unanticipated work that 
comes up during the renovations).
5.	 At the closing, the seller gets the home’s purchase price, and the funds 
for renovating the house go into an escrow account. The lender re-
leases those funds to pay for renovations as you have them done.

Buying a manufactured home
If you’re thinking about buying a manufactured home (page 62), you’ll be 
pleased to know that these homes are also eligible for FHA-insured loans. 
To qualify, the manufactured home must meet these conditions:
•	 The home’s living area is 400 square feet or larger.
•	 The home was built after June 15, 1976 and is certified to meet fed-
eral manufactured home construction and safety standards (page 63). 
Certified homes have a label to attest that they meet these standards.
•	 The home must meet the definition of a manufactured home (which 
means it has a permanent chassis) and must be attached to a perma-
nent foundation that meets FHA standards.
If the 203(k) program sounds like too much paperwork, there’s a Streamlined 
203(k) Program that lets you borrow up to $35,000 over the home’s purchase 
price for approved repairs and improvements. The streamlined program doesn’t 
cover major remodeling, repairing structural damage, moving a load-bearing wall, 
building an addition, or landscaping. But it does cover many of the most common 
upgrades, including painting, flooring, energy-efficiency improvements, minor 
kitchen and bath remodels, new appliances, and more. Ask your FHA-approved 
lender for details.

•	 The home must be your primary residence.
•	 The home must be taxed as real estate, not personal property.
•	 The home cannot be in a flood zone.
Veteran’s Administration Loans
If you’re an armed services veteran, on active duty, serving in the reserves 
or National Guard, or you’re a military spouse, you may be eligible for a 
Veteran’s Administration loan. You get your loan through a private lender, 
and the Veterans Administration guarantees a portion of it. If you want to 
buy a home, condominium, or manufactured home, the VA guarantees up 
to $417,000 of the total loan. With a VA-guaranteed loan, you don’t have 
to worry about financing a down payment, but you do have to pay some 
financing fees and closing costs.
Here’s how a VA loan guarantee works: When you borrow money thought 
a commercial lender, the VA protects the lender against loss if you fail to 
repay the loan. This makes VA loans very attractive to lenders, and you can 
get a good interest rate through the program.
Eligibility is based on your military service and typically falls into one of 
these categories:
•	 Wartime. This category covers service during the following periods:
—
— World War II: September 16,1940 to July 25, 1947. 
—
— Korean War: June 27, 1950 to January 31, 1955. 
—
— Vietnam War: August 5, 1964 to May 7, 1975. 
•	 Peacetime. This category includes service during these periods:
—
— July 26, 1947 to June 26, 1950. 
—
— February 1, 1955 to August 4, 1964. 
—
— May 8, 1975 to September 7, 1980 for enlisted personnel; May 8, 
1975 to October 16, 1981 for officers. 
You must have been on active duty for at least 90 days, and you cannot have been 
discharged under dishonorable conditions. If you served less than 90 days, you 
may be eligible if you were discharged for a service-related disability.

Chapter 7
184
•	 Service after 9/7/1980 (enlisted personnel) or 10/16/1981 (offi-
cers). If your service began after these dates, you must meet these one 
of these criteria:
—
— You completed 24 months of continuous active duty or the full 
period (at least 181 days) for which you were ordered or called 
to active duty, and you were not discharged under dishonorable 
conditions.
—
— You completed at least 181 days of active duty and were dis-
charged under the specific authority of 10 USC 1173 (Hardship), or 
10 USC 1171 (Early Out), or you were determined to have a com-
pensable service-related disability. 
—
— You were discharged with less than 181 days of service for a ser-
vice-related disability. You may also be eligible if you were released 
from active duty due to an involuntary reduction in force or certain 
medical conditions. 
•	 Gulf War. This category covers service from August 2, 1990 to a date 
that’s yet to be determined. If you served on active duty during the 
Gulf War, you must meet one of these criteria:
—
— You completed 24 months of continuous active duty or the full 
period (at least 181 days) for which you were ordered or called 
to active duty, and you were not discharged under dishonorable 
conditions. 
—
— You completed at least 90 days of active duty and were discharged 
under the specific authority of 10 USC 1173 (Hardship), or 10 USC 
1171 (Early Out), or you were determined to have a compensable 
service-related disability. 
—
— You were discharged with less than 90 days of service for a service-
related disability. You may also be eligible if you were released 
from active duty due to an involuntary reduction in force or certain 
medical conditions. 
•	 Active duty service personnel. If you are now on regular duty (not 
active duty for training), you are eligible after you’ve served 181 days 
(90 days during the Gulf War), unless you were discharged or separat-
ed from a previous qualifying period of active duty service.
You must have served at least 181 days of continuous active duty, and you cannot 
have been discharged under dishonorable conditions. If you served less than 181 
days, you may be eligible if discharged for a service-related disability.

•	 Selected Reserves or National Guard. If you are not otherwise eli-
gible, you may qualify if you completed a total of 6 years in the Selected 
Reserves or National Guard (as member of an active unit who attended 
required weekend drills and two-week active duty for training) and meet 
one of these criteria:
—
— You were honorably discharged. 
—
— You were placed on the retired list. 
—
— You were transferred to the Standby Reserve or an element of the 
Ready Reserve other than the Selected Reserve after honorable 
service. 
—
— You continue to serve in the Selected Reserves. 
Under certain conditions, military spouses may also qualify for VA-guaranteed 
loans:
•	 If your spouse was a serviceperson who died in action or of a service-
related injury, and you haven’t remarried.
•	 If your spouse is a serviceperson who’s missing in action or a prisoner 
of war.
To apply for a VA-guaranteed loan, you first need to obtain a Certificate of 
Eligibility, which requires a copy of your service record. Then you work with 
a commercial lender to get the loan. The VA requires an appraisal of the 
property to confirm the home’s value.
If you think you may qualify for a VA home loan, go to www.military.com/
Finance/HomeBuying to learn more about the process and to apply for 
your Certificate of Eligibility.
HUD Special Home-buying Programs
HUD offers several home-buying programs for people in special situations:
•	 The Good Neighbor Next Door program. If you’re a teacher (pre-K 
through grade 12), firefighter, law enforcement officer, or emergency 
medical technician, you may be able buy a HUD home at a 50 percent 
discount. You have to meet two conditions: The home must be in a re-
vitalization area, and you must agree to live there for 36 months after 
you buy the home. 
If you completed fewer than 6 years of service, you may be eligible if you were 
discharged for a service-related disability.

Chapter 7
186
•	 Public housing home ownership programs. Local Public Housing 
Authorities (PHAs) may make public housing units available for low-
income families to buy as their primary residence. PHAs may also offer 
financial assistance. 
•	 Home ownership vouchers. Some PHAs offer voucher programs that 
help new homeowners pay their monthly home ownership expenses. 
These vouchers can go toward PITI payments, utilities, routine mainte-
nance, repairs, and handicap access.
•	 Section 184 Indian Home Loan Guarantee program. Designed for 
Native American and Alaskan Native home buyers, this program re-
quires a loan down payment (1.25 percent for loans under $50,000, 
2.25 percent for loans over that amount), no monthly mortgage insur-
ance payments, and special underwriting requirements designed to 
make it easier for Native Americans to buy a home. There’s a 1 percent 
loan guarantee fee, which you can roll into the loan. 
Creative Financing Options
Some homebuyers look beyond the traditional options offered by com-
mercial lenders and government programs. This section describes other 
kinds of financing that may help you buy your new home. Before you head 
down the road less taken, though, be aware that these options may be 
riskier than traditional financing. Always consult a real estate attorney to 
make sure you know what you’re getting into.  
Getting Help with the Down Payment
One of the biggest obstacles to buying a home is finding the money for 
the down payment. Today, many lenders want 20 percent down before 
they’ll approve a loan. 
To find a local PHA home-buying assistance program, go to www.hud.gov/buying/
localbuying.cfm and click the name of your state.

80/20 loan
You may have heard about “no money down” or “zero down payment” 
loans that let you buy a home now, without spending years scraping to-
gether a down payment. These loans were popular in the 1990s through 
the mid-2000s, before the housing bubble burst. Now, they’re practically 
extinct. That’s not a bad thing. By skipping the down payment, many 
homeowners borrowed more than they could afford and got into trouble 
when housing prices slumped.
A “no money down” loan, also called a piggyback loan, is really two loans: 
•	 A primary mortgage that lends you 80 percent of the home’s purchase 
price.
•	 A second mortgage that lends you the other 20 percent at a higher 
rate.
You still have to pay closing costs and fees. Because the primary mortgage 
is for 80 percent of the home’s value, you don’t have to buy private mort-
gage insurance (PMI—see the box on page 146).
Because the second mortgage is at a higher rate than the first, 80/20 loans 
can be expensive. In addition, you build equity slowly because you’re pay-
ing off two loans simultaneously, and both are front-loaded with interest 
payments. And if housing prices fall, you could end up with negative eq-
uity (page 23), making it difficult to sell or refinance the home. 
80/10/10 loan
Another kind of piggyback loan lets you make a smaller down payment 
and take out a second mortgage to make up the difference between the 
amount you’re able to pay in cash and the amount you need to avoid PMI. 
Here’s how an 80/10/10 loan breaks down:
•	 A primary mortgage lends you 80 percent of the home’s purchase 
price.
•	 A second mortgage lends you 10 percent at a higher rate.
•	 You pay a 10 percent down payment (instead of the traditional 20 
percent).
80/10/10 loans are less risky than 80/20 loans because the down payment 
starts you off with some equity in your house. Lenders also have more con-
fidence in a borrower who can invest money up front in their home.
If you’re considering an 80/10/10 loan, look into FHA-insured loans (page 
180) as an alternative. If you qualify, you may be able to buy a house with 
as little as 3.5 percent down and saving money on interest. Even though 

Chapter 7
188
you’ll pay PMI, it may be worth it to avoid the higher interest rate on the 
second mortgage of the piggyback loan. Ask your mortgage broker or loan 
officer to compare the costs of an 80/10/10 loan with your other options.
Seller Financing
Some sellers are willing to help you buy their house. You’ll see this option 
more often in a buyer’s market. Sellers may try to grab buyers’ attention by 
offering to help with closing costs or make arrangements to finance all or 
part of the purchase. Seller financing is relatively rare, though, and there 
are a couple of good reasons why:
•	 The seller has to pay off his existing mortgage. In most situations, 
a homeowner can’t transfer title to a new owner without paying off 
the property’s current mortgage. A seller who had to take out his own 
mortgage probably can’t afford to finance your mortgage.
•	 The seller wants the money from the sale all at once. Even if the 
seller owns his home free and clear (because he paid off the mortgage, 
perhaps, or inherited a paid-off property), most sellers expect a big 
infusion of cash when they sell a home. Often, they need that cash 
as a down payment on their next home. Many sellers don’t want to 
bother with incremental payments from buyers, even if they’d make 
more money from them in the long run.
In some cases, however, sellers have both the means and the motive to 
help with financing. This section explains seller-financing arrangements 
you might encounter.
Seller mortgage
The seller may agree to hold a mortgage so that you can purchase the 
home by paying installments over time, just as you would with a commer-
cial loan. Sellers who do this may require a higher interest rate or a shorter 
term than you’d get from a commercial lender. 
If you’re considering a seller mortgage, you need to hire a real estate attor-
ney to help you draft the paperwork and to make sure you’re not signing 
anything that would work to your disadvantage.
Sellers who offer financing sometimes do so because they’re desperate to sell a 
property. There may be problems with the home they hope you don’t discover 
before you finalize the sale. Others try to take advantage of buyers unfamiliar 
with conventional financing arrangements. If you consider seller financing, you 
must consult a real estate attorney to check all documents related to the sale and 
financing before you sign anything.

189
Second mortgage from seller
Sometimes the seller may not be in immediate need of all the cash from 
the sale of his house. This usually happens when he’s built up lot of eq-
uity in the house—for example, when retired empty-nesters sell the family 
home to downsize to a smaller place. A seller in this situation may offer you 
a second mortgage on the property (in addition to the one you get from a 
commercial lender to finance most of the purchase price)  to help you buy 
it. This kind of seller financing usually has a 5- or 10-year term, after which 
the loan is due in full. 
A second mortgage from the seller can help you avoid paying PMI. Since 
most lenders require PMI for financing above 80 percent of the purchase 
price, seller financing can make up the difference between your down pay-
ment and the amount you need to put up to avoid PMI or to meet loan-
program requirements. Some sellers let you defer payments on the second 
mortgage for up to a year (though the amount you borrow still accrues 
interest during that time). 
During the term of the second mortgage, your equity will grow, and you 
can combine that equity with savings to refinance your loan and get a sin-
gle, conventional, PMI-free 80 percent loan—and pay off the seller’s sec-
ond mortgage.
Rent-to-own
At one time or another, most renters have pondered the fact that they pay 
money each month just to live in their homes—instead of building equity 
or putting the money toward a place of their own, they simply pay for the 
right to live in a house or apartment from one month or one year to the 
next. Wouldn’t it be great if some of that rent money could go toward buy-
ing a home? That’s what rent-to-own financing does. 
There are two common kinds of rent-to-own arrangements:
•	 Lease option. In this arrangement, you buy an option to buy the 
home. That is, you give your landlord some money in exchange for the 
exclusive right to buy the property for an agreed-upon price within 
a specified period of time, usually one to three years. You also sign a 
lease agreeing to pay a certain amount of rent each month, some of 
If you plan to get a second mortgage from the seller, tell your primary-mortgage 
lender up front, before you apply for a mortgage. The lender will want to see docu-
mentation about the proposed second mortgage, so have that ready.

Chapter 7
190
which goes toward your purchase of the home. During the option pe-
riod, your landlord agrees not to sell the house to anyone else. You can 
exercise the option to buy  any time the option is in effect. If you de-
cide not to buy, you can let the option expire, but you probably won’t 
get back the money you paid for the option.
•	 Lease purchase. This works similarly to a lease option, except instead 
of saying that “maybe” you’ll buy the home, you agree to buy it after a 
specified period of time. During the lease, part of your rent payments 
go toward the purchase. After that, you apply for a bank loan to com-
plete the purchase. During the lease, you’ll probably be responsible for 
costs associated with the home, including maintenance, repairs, taxes, 
and insurance.
The purchase price is, of course, negotiable. With a lease option, you might 
agree on a specific, set price or agree to pay market value when you ex-
ercise the option. With a lease purchase, it’s common to agree on a price 
that’s slightly above the current market value. Remember that, in either 
case, your lender will require an appraisal to confirm the home’s worth 
what you’re paying for it.
Assuming the Seller’s Loan
Most mortgages have a “due on sale” clause that says that the mortgagor 
must repay the loan in full when he sells the home. But some loans are as-
sumable, which means that you can take over the seller’s loan, paying off the 
current balance with the same terms the seller got. This can be a good deal 
when interest rates are high and the loan you’re assuming has a low one. 
When you assume a loan, you pay the seller cash for the equity in the 
house. The amount of cash is the difference between the purchase price 
and the balance on the loan you’re assuming. (You can also get a second 
mortgage to help pay that difference.) Assumable loans are almost always 
ARMs, so be aware that the loan’s rate can rise after you assume it.
Laws governing lease options and lease purchases vary from state to state, so con-
sult a real estate attorney before you enter into a rent-to-own agreement.

Compare Mortgages and Other Financing Options
191
To assume the loan, you have to qualify, just as you would if you were tak-
ing out a new loan. You’ll pay an assumption fee of several hundred dollars 
and other processing fees, but these should be lower than the fees for a 
new loan. Some loans are subject to a rate adjustment at assumption—so 
make sure you’re not losing the benefit of a lower interest rate when you 
assume the seller’s loan. 
Paying with Cash
Sounds great, doesn’t it? Cut out all the hassle of dealing with lenders and 
just fork over the cash to pay for you new house. For most of us, that’s a 
daydream—most homebuyers don’t have the spare cash to buy a home. 
But sometimes people get a chunk of money through a windfall, such as 
an inheritance, and find themselves in a position to buy a house without 
going through a lender.
If the seller is in a hurry, a cash sale is a good thing. You eliminate weeks of 
waiting if you don’t have to apply for financing. In a slow real estate mar-
ket, or when a seller is eager to move on, this makes your cash offer very 
appealing. Under other conditions, though, a cash offer may not stand out 
as much as you think. As long as the seller gets paid, he doesn’t care all that 
much whether the money comes from a commercial lender or out of your 
bank account. A cash offer is better than an offer where the financing is in 
doubt, but if the seller is reasonably confident that a competing bidder will 
get financing, there’s no strong reason to prefer cash.
Also, if you pay cash for a home, you lose the tax benefit of deducting mort-
gage interest from your income taxes. You may find that it makes more 
financial sense to invest your windfall, take out a mortgage, and claim the 
tax break. Talk with an accountant to see what’s best for you.

W
hat you pay for your mortgage depends on a number of fac-
tors: the current interest rates, the amount you want to borrow, 
your credit history and financial profile (income, debt, employ-
ment), the kind of loan you choose, the size of your down payment—the 
list goes on and on. Some of these factors you control; others you don’t.
Before you apply for a mortgage, educating yourself is key. When you un-
derstand how mortgage loans work, you can identify which kind is best 
for you. So if you haven’t yet read Chapter 7, now is a good time to do so.
This chapter takes you through the next stage of getting a mortgage—
choosing and applying for a loan. It shows you how to find the right lender 
and compare the full costs of their mortgages. Then it guides you through 
the maze of applying for a loan—from gathering the documents you need 
to filling out the application and understanding the forms the lender gives 
you in return. Knowing what to expect when you apply will make the pro-
cess smoother and easier—and will get you into your new home faster.

Find the Right Lender
Google the phrase mortgage lender and you’ll be inundated with results—
local and national lenders all crying out for you to take a look at their loans. 
How do you wade through all of them to find the best one? This section 
steers you in the right direction.
Decide the Kind of Loan Originator You Want
You can set up a mortgage loan through one of two people: a mortgage 
broker or a loan officer, both described below. Collectively, these people 
are known as loan originators.
You might prefer to work with a mortgage broker, an independent third 
party who searches the different mortgage products lenders offer region-
ally or nationwide to find the best one for you. Or you might work with a 
loan officer, an employee at a specific financial institution who represents 
that institution only. If you want to select from a wide variety of lenders 
and loans, go with a mortgage broker. If you prefer to work with a local 
institution, you’ll probably be working with a loan officer.
Ask for Referrals
Friends, family members, neighbors, coworkers—anyone you know who 
owns their home almost certainly has experience with a mortgage lender. 
Ask if they’re happy with their lender and their loan. Would they work with 
the same lender again? Why or why not?
Your real estate agent is another good source of referrals. Agents work 
with mortgage professionals on a regular basis and can recommend those 
they’ve had good experiences with. 
Before you decide to work with a particular loan originator, have at least one con-
versation with them. You need to find someone you can trust and feel comfortable 
with, someone you can ask questions and rely on to explain things clearly. Page 97 
has questions you can ask mortgage brokers and loan officers to find the  
best one.

Visit Your Local Bank
The bank, savings and loan, or credit union where you have your checking 
and savings accounts knows you. You know them, too, and probably feel 
comfortable with them. Almost every local bank has a loan officer who can 
tell you what kinds of mortgages the bank offers (15- and 30-year fixed, 
ARMs, and so on). When you keep it local, you work with a lender who 
knows you, your finances, and the value of real estate in your area. Local 
lenders may be a bit more flexible in granting loans to people they know 
than large mortgage companies that make loans nationwide.
Check Out Online Lenders
The Internet lets you apply for a mortgage from lenders across the coun-
try, expanding your options for finding the best loan. At the same time, 
you might feel uncomfortable going online and filling out a form with de-
tailed personal and financial information—your full name, Social Security 
number, current address, employer, salary, and more—exactly the kind of 
information that scammers and identity thieves would love to get their 
hands on.
To find a trustworthy online lender, follow these tips:
•	 Stick with companies you’ve heard of. When you’re looking online, 
get recommendations from friends and acquaintances, just as you 
would when looking for a local lender. 
•	 Know what’s a realistic rate. Before you go loan shopping online, 
check interest rates locally (call a couple of banks or look in the news-
paper) to get an idea of what they are in your area. Reputable online 
lenders’ rates will be in the same ballpark. 
•	 Be wary of big loans. An online lender may say you qualify for a much 
larger loan than other lenders offer. Some predatory lenders dangle a 
loan that’s more than you can reasonably afford so you’ll have to take 
out subsequent loans at a much higher interest rate to keep up with 
your first loan’s payments. Every lender determines its loan amounts 
differently, but there shouldn’t be a huge difference between the high-
est and lowest loans they offer you.
•	 Check the lender’s “About Us” page. See how long the lender has 
been in business (the longer its track record, the better).

Chapter 8
196
•	 Check the lender’s track record. Federal agencies have websites 
where you can check to see whether a lender has gotten in trouble 
with the feds:
—
— Federal Trade Commission (www.ftc.gov). The FTC, a consumer 
protection agency, collects complaints about companies, business 
practices, and identity theft. 
—
— Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (www.fdic.gov). If the 
lender is federally insured, search for it on the FDIC’s website to 
get more information.
—
— National Credit Union Administration (www.ncua.gov). Some 
credit unions have online loan forms. Before you apply, check out 
the credit union with the NCUA.
•	 Look for complaints at consumer review sites. To read about prob-
lems consumers have run into with online lenders, check out www.
consumeraffairs.com and complaints.com.
•	 Don’t get hooked by a phishing scam. When scammers go phishing, 
they send out official-looking emails promising a great interest rate or 
no credit check. The email includes a link that takes you to a website 
with a form for you to fill out. But instead of giving you a rate quote, 
the scammer steals your personal information. If a too-good-to-be-
true mortgage offer lands in your email inbox, don’t fall for it. Never 
click a link in an unsolicited email offer.
Here are some online lenders that have been in business for a while:
•	 Ditech (www.ditech.com). Owned by GMAC, this company has been 
around since 1995.
•	 EverBank (www.everbank.com). Based in Jacksonville, Florida, this 
company offers mortgage loans nationwide.
•	 LendingTree (www.lendingtree.com). This site lets you compare loans 
from up to four different lenders to find the best rate.
•	 Quicken Loans (www.quickenloans.com). National Mortgage News 
named Quicken Loans the largest online lender in the U.S.
Most online lenders show you current interest rates and provide calcula-
tors that let you compare loans. If you have any questions, you can contact 
the lender several ways: fill out an online form, chat in real time, or call 
them.

Get the Best Mortgage
Nobody wants to pay more for a loan than they have to. But with so many 
loan products available (see Chapter 7), it can be hard to know whether 
you’re getting the best possible deal. Should you find the cash to pay up-
front discount points and lower your interest rate? Is a shorter term (and 
the resulting higher monthly payments) worth the lower interest rate and 
faster repayment? Whether you’re looking at a fixed-rate loan or an ARM, 
this section helps you find the best all-around mortgage loan.
Researching Rates
When you shop for a mortgage, your goal is clear: You want to find the 
least expensive loan possible. But that doesn’t always mean the loan with 
the lowest interest rate.
You might open the newspaper or go to Bankrate.com to check available 
loans and compare rates. Or you might pick up the phone and start call-
ing local lenders to ask for their rates. And although these methods can 
give you a ballpark, they’re not the best way to shop for a loan, for several 
reasons:
•	 There are too many variables among loans. Interest rates vary ac-
cording to the type of loan you get. ARMs, for example, have lower 
initial rates than fixed-rate loans. Different terms also mean different 
rates: A 15-year loan will have a lower interest rate (but higher monthly 
payments) than a 30-year loan. And prepaying interest in the form of 
discount points (page 157) gets you a lower interest rate but costs you 
more up front. With all these variables, simply comparing interest rates 
is like comparing apples to oranges to bananas to mangoes. Looking 
at a single number—the interest rate—won’t show you the least ex-
pensive loan.
Bankrate.com helps you find lenders that do business in your area. Go to www.
bankrate.com, and then click Mortgage. On the page that opens, go to the “Find 
a Mortgage rate” section and then enter your state, city, the amount you want to 
borrow, and the kind of loan you want. Click Search to get a list of loans available 
in your area from both local and online lenders.

Chapter 8

•	 The interest rate doesn’t give you the total cost of a loan. Your 
mortgage costs more than the interest rate and principal you pay. You 
also have to pay up-front costs, including processing and origination 
fees, an appraisal fee, a credit check fee, and more (Chapter 9 details 
typical closing costs). To make it easier for borrowers to compare mort-
gage costs, the annual percentage rate (APR, page 153) calculates the 
total cost of a mortgage loan, including all these fees. Comparing APRs 
gives you a better basis for evaluating loans—but even they don’t tell 
the whole story, as the next point explains.   
•	 Lenders calculate APRs differently. APRs are supposed to create a 
standard so consumers can easily compare loans. But there is no stan-
dard way to calculate APRs. Some unscrupulous lenders may exclude 
charges from the calculation to make their APR look lower than it actu-
ally is—which makes the loan look less expensive than it actually is.
•	 Without figuring in information specific to you, a rate quote is 
meaningless. If you see or hear that Bank X offers 30-year fixed-rate 
loans at 4.875 percent, it doesn’t mean that you’ll qualify for that rate. 
A lender assesses the amount of your down payment, your ability to 
pay back the loan, and your financial history before offering you a spe-
cific interest rate. The better your credit score, for example, the better 
the rate you can qualify for. In addition, a rate quoted over the phone 
represents a ballpark figure; to actually get that rate, you have to lock 
it in (page 204).
•	 Rates change daily. When you see interest rates published in the 
newspaper, they’re already old news (by at least a day or two). And in-
terest rates change daily, so the great-looking rate you see in the paper 
or online on Monday may no longer be the best deal by the time you 
submit your loan application on Wednesday.
If the information you get about interest rates through published sources 
or over the phone represents only part of the mortgage loan story, how do 
you shop for a loan? Easy. Use these sources to get good ballpark figures 
for your loan, but then get full estimates in writing. Follow these steps:
1.	 Get your documentation together. 
Start by gathering all the documents you’ll need to apply for a loan 
(page 206 lists those for you). This puts your financial information at 
your fingertips for the interview you’re about to conduct and tells the 
mortgage broker or loan officer you’re serious about getting a loan. 
And it allows you to act quickly when you decide to apply.

199
2.	 Choose three mortgage brokers to ask for a quote.
You can find them through several sources. The best is to get a recom-
mendation: Ask friends, family, coworkers, and your real estate agent, 
for example. You can also check the local Yellow Pages or use an online 
directory like the one at the National Association of Mortgage Brokers 
website (go to www.namb.org and click Find a NAMB Broker).
3.	 Call the loan originators you chose. 
Tell each the basics of your financial situation and the kind of loan you 
want, and then ask for a Good Faith Estimate (GFE) for that loan. Say 
that you need the Good Faith Estimate by the next day because you 
want to make an accurate comparison of what three brokers can find 
for you. Also mention that you’re prepared to move quickly to apply.
Tell the broker or loan officer your current credit score (see page 45 
for details on how to get that), the purchase price of the home, the 
amount of your down payment, and the amount you want to borrow. 
For the type of loan, mention the term you want (15- or 30-year, for ex-
ample), whether you want a fixed-rate loan or an ARM (and if the latter, 
the ARM type, such as 5/1 or 7/1), and any special considerations you 
want, such as no prepayment penalty.
If the broker is reluctant to supply a GFE (it takes some work to fill one 
out), explain that you understand it’s an estimate and that rates are 
subject to change.
As you learned above, a mortgage broker (as opposed to a bank’s loan officer) has 
access to information about loans from many lenders, so you get a wider variety 
of quotes. On the other hand, local banks and credit unions know the local real-
estate market and often have good rates for local purchases. So you might want to 
consult two mortgage brokers and one local loan officer instead of three brokers, 
especially if you want to keep your transaction local.
Page 221 shows you how to read your Good Faith Estimate to compare the total 
costs of different loans.

Chapter 8
200
You want a GFE and not just a quote because the GFE gives you the 
clearest picture of the total cost of a loan. Some brokers may be reluc-
tant to fill out an actual GFE because of recent changes to regulations 
governing this form. In that case, ask the broker to prepare an estimate 
using the same calculations and information as a GFE but without us-
ing the form itself. Or ask the broker to fill out a column of the “shop-
ping chart” section of the form (page 215 shows an example of a GFE 
shopping chart).
4.	 Compare GFEs.
It’s important that you get your three GFEs on the same day, because 
if the forms are even a day apart, rates may have changed and you’re 
no longer comparing similar loans. Page 215 takes you through a GFE 
section by section, so you know how to read it.
Comparing fixed-rate loans
Homeowners choose fixed-rate loans because they’re the most stable, pre-
dictable ones on the market: For the term of your loan (or until you sell or 
refinance), your principal and interest payments remain the same. These 
loans should be easy to compare, but look at the following table, which 
show actual rates for 30-year fixed-rate loans at the time of writing:

When requesting GFEs to compare, make sure you get the same information from 
each broker: The type of loan, the term, and the number of points should be the 
same for each quote. You want to compare apples to apples.

A table of numbers like this can make your eyes cross. Loan 6 is clearly the 
most expensive, with the highest interest rate, the highest APR and the 
highest up-front fees. Even though it doesn’t require any points at closing, 
you’ll pay the most for this loan in the long run.
Loan 7 looks like the least expensive loan: It has the lowest interest rate 
and the lowest APR. But it’ll cost you more up front than some of the other 
options, with 2 points and $695 in lender fees. Loan 2 is comparable in 
terms of interest rate and APR, although it costs a few hundred dollars 
more at closing, with its extra half-point and higher fees. 
Which of these loans is best? Unfortunately, there is no single answer. Ev-
ery borrower has different needs. If you can afford the cost of prepaid in-
terest and you expect to live in your new home long enough to see its 
benefit (page 158 tells you how to calculate the break-even point), you 
might decide to pay some points to get a lower interest rate. If you don’t 
have much spare cash or if you expect to move in a few years, you might 
accept a slightly higher interest rate for lower up-front fees. There’s simply 
no such thing as a one-size-fits-all loan. 
That said, here’s how you decide what works for you. First up, here’s what 
to look for in fixed-interest loans, followed by the variables you’ll find if you 
shop for an ARM.
When you shop for a fixed-rate loan, pay attention to these components:
•	 Interest rate. In general, the lower your interest rate, the better. But a 
low interest rate is never the whole story. A lower rate may be tied to 
something you don’t want or can’t afford right now, such as a shorter 
term (15 years) or prepaid interest points. On the other hand, you may 
prefer to pay more now for those things precisely because they’ll save 
you money on interest in the long run.
•	 Term. If you want lower monthly payments, choose a longer-term 
loan, such as 30 years—but be aware that the longer term costs you 
more in interest as the years go by. If you want to build equity faster, 
choose a shorter-term loan, such as 15 years. But shorter terms mean 
higher monthly payments. Read about loan terms on page 177.
•	 Number of points. By prepaying some of the loan’s interest at the 
closing, you can reduce your loan’s interest rate. This prepaid interest is 
referred to as points or discount points. Each point equals 1 percent of 
the loan amount, and each point lowers the interest rate a little. (How 
much depends on a variety of factors, but it’s usually between 0.125 
and 0.25 percent of the interest rate.) Most lenders let you prepay in-
terest in the range of 0 to 4 points.

Chapter 8
202
To find out whether you’ll save money by prepaying interest, find the 
break-even point: the number of months it takes for the lower interest 
rate to pay for the cost of the points. If, for example, you paid 1 point 
to get the interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate loan down from 5.25 
percent to 5 percent, that prepaid interest would cost $2,500. The low-
er interest rate means lower monthly payments, and after 65 months 
(about 5 1/2 years), you’d have saved that $2,500. From that point on, 
you’d reap the financial benefits of the lower interest rate. Page 158 
shows you how to calculate a loan’s break-even point.
When you decide what you’re looking for in a fixed-rate loan and shop 
around for loans with those characteristics, you’ll be able to compare ap-
ples to apples to find the best option.
Comparing ARMs
ARM interest rates look attractive because they’re lower than the interest 
rates on fixed-rate loans. But remember, what you see is the initial inter-
est rate, and that rate will change. For some ARMs, the initial rate remains 
steady for a year or longer. For others, your rate can change as quickly as a 
month after you sign the loan papers.
No one can predict what interest rates will do. If you shop for an ARM when 
interest rates are low, it’s a good guess that rates will increase in the future. 
And that means that your index-tied interest payments will increase, too 
(see page 164 to learn how lenders tie ARM interest rates to an index).
When you compare ARMs, keep these factors in mind:
•	 Index. This is what your lender uses as the base for your interest rate. 
Page 165 goes over the indexes most commonly used to determine 
ARM interest rates. If you shop for a loan when rates are low, look for 
an ARM whose index lags a bit behind market rates, such as a COFI-
based ARM (page 166), because your rate will rise more slowly. 
•	 Margin. This is the markup on the index that determines your interest 
rate (index rate + margin = the rate you pay). For loans linked to the 
same index, a lower margin means a better interest rate.
When you shop for a loan, ask to see the same loan with 0, 1, and 2 discount 
points. You can compare monthly payments, find the different break-even points, 
and see which combination of points and interest rate works best for you.

Choose and Apply for a Mortgage
203
•	 Adjustment period. This tells you how often the loan’s rate can 
change. More frequent adjustments make the loan less predictable, 
subjecting your monthly principal and interest payments to wider 
swings up and down. Hybrid loans (page 164) have two adjustment 
periods: the one that marks the end of the initial fixed-rate period and 
the periodic adjustment after that. So, for example, a 5/1 ARM keeps its 
initial rate for 5 years and then it adjusts annually after that.
•	 Caps. ARMs usually come with a periodic cap, which limits the amount 
your interest rate can increase from one adjustment period to the next, 
and a lifetime cap, which sets the maximum interest rate your loan will 
ever have. Typical periodic caps are 1 percent for a loan that adjusts ev-
ery six months and 2 percent for a loan that adjusts annually. A typical 
lifetime cap is 5 or 6 percent above your initial interest rate. Avoid loans 
that have a payment cap—which limits the amount your monthly 
payments can rise in terms of dollars, not interest rate—because 
this can lead to negative amortization (page 168). Even though your 
payments are capped, the interest you owe can keep increasing to the 
point where you owe more than the house is worth. 
If you’re considering a hybrid loan (page 164) and there’s a chance you’ll 
stay in your home beyond the initial, fixed-rate period, figure out how 
much your monthly payments would jump in the worst-case scenario. If 
your rate were to go up by the maximum amount allowed by each peri-
odic cap until it hit its lifetime cap, how much would that cost you each 
month? Before you sign the loan papers, you need to assess whether you 
could make the required payments if that happens. Use the ARM calcula-
tor at Interest.com (http://tinyurl.com/yjzloge) to get a sense of the highest 
your payments could rise.
If you look for a mortgage when rates are low, a longer initial adjustment period 
(such as 5 or 7 years) will keep your interest rate low if rates start to creep up. But 
that first adjustment could cause a big jump in your payments—up to the full 
periodic cap (see below).
Many people go with an ARM thinking that, if rates start to rise too sharply, they 
can refinance to a fixed-rate loan. That is true, but keep in mind that, to refinance, 
you have to pay closing costs—and perhaps a prepayment penalty (page 170).

Chapter 8
204
Prepaying Interest
You can reduce the interest rate on your loan by paying some interest in 
advance, using discount points (page 157). If you plan to stay in your home 
for many years to come, paying points on a fixed-rate loan can save you a 
substantial amount of money—tens of thousands of dollars—by reducing 
the interest you pay over the long term. But you have to stick around long 
enough to get to your loan’s break-even point, where the money you save 
on interest payments becomes greater than the cost of the points (page 
158 shows you how to find your loan’s break-even point). 
What about ARMs? Those usually start out with a lower interest rate than 
a fixed-rate loan that has the same term. Is it worth it to reduce the rate 
further by paying points up front? To answer that question, consider these 
factors:
•	 When would you reach the break-even point at your loan’s initial 
rate? Using the formula on page 158, figure out how long it would 
take to reach the break-even point if your initial rate never changed.
•	 When does the initial rate adjust? If your rate will change after only a 
few months or a year, that’s not enough time to reach the break-even 
point, and paying points up front makes no sense. If the loan is a hy-
brid ARM, however, with an initial fixed rate period of 5 years or longer, 
you may be able to save some money by prepaying interest if you’d 
reach the break-even point before the loan adjusts.
Whether you’re considering a fixed-rate loan or an ARM, discount points 
are all about the break-even point: Will you stay in your home long enough 
to realize the savings you get by prepaying interest? For an ARM, make 
sure that your initial fixed-rate period stretches past that break-even point. 
You’re more likely to save money if you pay points on a 5/1 or 7/1 ARM than 
on an ARM with a shorter initial rate.
Locking In Your Rate
The interest rate shown in your Good Faith Estimate can expire and is sub-
ject to change—right up until you sign the loan papers—unless you lock 
in that rate. A rate lock is just what it sounds like: a set-in-stone guarantee 
that your interest rate won’t change between the time you lock in that rate 
and lock’s expiration date, usually 30 days.
When you lock in your rate is partly up to the lender and partly up to you. 
Some lenders won’t let you lock in a rate until after you get your loan ap-
proved; others let you do it earlier, usually after they’ve appraised the 
house. And some automatically lock in the rate when they approve a loan. 

Choose and Apply for a Mortgage
205
Ask your mortgage broker or loan officer when you can lock in the rate. 
After that, the time you lock in the rate is up to you. Watch rates using a 
site like Bankrate.com (go to www.bankrate.com and then click Mortgage). 
If rates seem to be going down, you might wait to lock in the rate. When 
you see a rate that looks good—in other words, a rate at which you’d be 
comfortable paying the monthly principal and interest on your loan—call 
your mortgage broker to lock it in and be assured that that’s the rate you’ll 
pay. Rate locks work both ways: Your loan’s interest rate won’t increase if 
rates go up, but it won’t decrease if it goes down, either.
Many lenders don’t charge you to lock in your rate for 30 days (some loans 
come with 45- or even 60-day locks). If it looks like you might need more 
time than that to get to closing, you can buy a longer rate lock. How much 
that costs depends on the lender and on how long you want the rate lock 
to last—you may pay up to a point (due at closing) for the lock to last an-
other 60 days. You may also have the option to pay for the lock over time, 
by locking in at a slightly higher interest rate.
Your rate-lock confirmation letter has four parts:
•	 The type of loan (30-year fixed-rate, 5/1 ARM, and so on)
•	 The interest rate
•	 The points you’re paying for the loan, including origination and dis-
count points
•	 The rate-lock period, including its expiration date
If any of that information is missing, contact your mortgage broker or loan 
officer immediately. You need all of it to make sure that your loan is correct 
at the closing.
Don’t gamble on your loan’s interest rate. Even when rates are decreasing, some-
thing can cause them to spike suddenly. If you’re happy with a rate, lock it in.
Your rate isn’t locked in until your mortgage broker or loan officer sends you a let-
ter confirming it. Don’t trust a phone confirmation. If your loan officer is late filing 
the paperwork to lock in the rate, you may find that it’s higher than what the loan 
officer told you it would be.

Chapter 8
206
If something delays your closing and your rate lock will expire before you 
can close, you may be able to buy a rate-lock extension. But for some lend-
ers, an expiration date is an expiration date, and they won’t honor the rate 
lock after it expires. Know your lender’s policy on extensions before you 
lock in a rate.
Gather Documents and 
Information
Applying for a mortgage can sometimes feel like you’re scaling—or maybe 
being buried under—a mountain of paperwork. Not only do you need to 
fill out forms that can run to several pages long, you have to provide back-
up documentation to support just about everything on those forms. Be-
fore you fill out your loan application, gather the documents you need. 
And watch out for paper cuts. 
Here’s a list of the documents and information your lender may require 
(not all items apply to everyone):
•	 Your purchase agreement 
•	 Original pay stubs from the last 30 days. These need to have your name, 
Social Security number, and year-to-date earnings on them
•	 Tax returns for the past two years
•	 Original W2 forms for the past two years
You’re not stuck with a particular lender if you lock in a rate. If rates go down, you 
can walk away from your loan application and go to a different lender, although 
you’ll give up any fees you’ve already paid. If you work with a mortgage broker, 
who has access to loans offered by many lenders, the broker may be able to switch 
to a different lender to get you locked in at a better rate.
If you got preapproved for a loan (page 34), you’ve already done the groundwork 
for your formal mortgage application. You may need to update your documenta-
tion, but you won’t have to supply everything all over again.

•	 Proof of any other income you have (such as alimony)
•	 Proof of other assets (including stocks, IRAs, and pension funds)
•	 Most recent statements for all loans and credit card accounts
•	 Three months’ worth of bank statements for all your accounts (check-
ing, savings, and so on)
•	 The source of your down payment, such as personal savings or a gift 
from a relative
•	 Your residential history for the past two years (addresses and dates)
•	 Names, addresses, and phone numbers of any landlords from the past 
two years
•	 Names, addresses, and phone numbers of your employers from the 
past two years
•	 Driver’s license or state ID and Social Security card (for FHA loans)
•	 Certificate of Eligibility (for VA loans)
Your loan originator should give you a list of the documents you’ll need for 
your specific situation. If not, ask for one. It’ll save everyone time for you to 
have the necessary papers in hand.
Do the Paperwork
When it’s time to apply for your loan, you may meet with your loan origi-
nator and fill out the application together, or you may give the originator 
your information over the phone or via an online form. Some borrowers fill 
out the application themselves and bring it in. It’s best if you can do the 
paperwork with your loan originator in case you have any questions. 
However you fill out the paperwork, though, there’s a lot of it, and it shines 
a bright light into all areas of your financial life. The information flows both 
ways: You tell the bank about your employment, your assets and liabilities, 
and your finances, and the bank gives you information about the loan and 
how much it will cost you. Read on to learn about the paperwork involved 
in a typical loan application.  
If you’re self-employed, you won’t have any W2s. Instead, you’ll need your com-
plete income tax returns, including all schedules, from the past two years, along 
with any business tax returns. If you file estimated income taxes each quarter, 
bring along two years’ worth of your 1040-ES forms as well.

Uniform Residential Loan Application
Although different lenders use different application forms, many work 
with the Uniform Residential Loan Application, often called Form 1003. 
Whether or not your lender uses this form, it shows the typical information 
that a mortgage application collects (you can follow along with the discus-
sion below by going to this book’s Missing CD at www.missingmanuals.
com/cds/ to get a copy of the form). Going through the application form 
section by section helps you prepare to apply for your loan, so you’ll have 
all the information you need ready when you need it.
Section I: Type of Mortgage and Terms of Loan
In this section, you specify the kind of loan you’re applying for:
•	 The type of loan (FHA, VA, conventional, and so on)
•	 The amount of money you want to borrow
•	 The interest rate of the loan you’re applying for
•	 The loan’s term (in months)
•	 The amortization type (fixed rate, ARM, and so on)
You’ve already worked with your mortgage broker or loan officer to get the 
answers to these questions. Make sure this part of the application matches 
your understanding of the loan.
Section II: Property Information and Purpose of Loan
In this section, you describe the property and how you intend to use it. 
Here’s what it asks for:
•	 Details of the property. Give the property’s address and a legal de-
scription of it. The legal description appears on the deed or property 
tax records; you can get it from the seller.
•	 The purpose of the loan. Are you buying or refinancing the house? 
Will the property be your primary residence, a second home, or an 
investment?
•	 Information about title. In this section, give the name (or names) of 
the title holder and indicate what type of title you’ll hold (see page 270 
for a description of the different ways you can hold title).
•	 Where you’ll get the down payment and closing costs. Explain 
where your down payment is coming from—personal savings, for ex-
ample, or a gift from a family member. If you’ll get a second mortgage, 
to help pay for your down payment or closing costs, explain that here.

Choose and Apply for a Mortgage
209
Section III: Borrower Information
This part’s all about you. It’s where you—and your co-borrower, if you have 
one—provide your name, Social Security number, date of birth, and how 
many years of school you’ve completed. You also must give your marital 
status and the number (and ages) of dependents. Finally, you provide your 
home phone number, current address, and previous address if you’ve lived 
in your current home for less than two years.
Section IV: Employment Information
To make sure you’ve got a stable job and can pay back your loan, the lend-
er needs to know about your current and past employment. This section 
collects the name, address, and phone number of your current employer. It 
also asks you to specify its type of business, your position there, how long 
you’ve been at this job, and how long you’ve worked in the same industry. 
Fill in all this information for yourself and your co-borrower if you’ve got 
one. And if you work at more than one job, give the information for all your 
employment.
If you’ve held your current job for less than two years, you must also give 
the same information about the previous job (or jobs) you held during 
those two years. 
Section V: Monthly Income and Combined Housing Expense 
Information
This part of the form comprises two sections: one for your household’s to-
tal monthly income, the other for your expenses:
•	 Gross monthly income. Here, write down how much money comes 
into your household each month from employment (salary or base 
wages), overtime, bonuses, commissions, dividends and interest, rent-
al income, and anything else that regularly brings in money. If you’re 
self-employed, be prepared to attach business-related tax returns and 
financial statements as supporting documents.
If you’re self-employed, check the “Self Employed” box in this section and supply 
the other information (type of business, how long you’ve been self-employed, and 
so on) as relevant.

Chapter 8
210
•	 Combined monthly housing expense. In this part, write down your 
current housing costs, including rent (if you don’t currently own your 
home), any mortgages, insurance, taxes, homeowners’ association 
dues, and any other monthly charges related to housing. Then esti-
mate how much you expect to pay for those same costs in your new 
home.
Section VI: Assets and Liabilities
This section presents your financial profile beyond month-to-month in-
come and expenses. Assets, the things you own that have value, may be 
liquid (cash or quickly convertible to cash, like CDs) or other property. List 
these assets:
•	 Your earnest money deposit
•	 Checking and savings accounts
•	 Certificates of deposit
•	 Stocks and bonds
•	 Life insurance
•	 Any real estate you currently own
•	 Retirement accounts
•	 The net worth of any businesses you own
•	 Automobiles
•	 Other assets (list what they are)
Next come your liabilities—the money you owe. Common liabilities in-
clude car loans, student loans, credit card debt, mortgages on other prop-
erties, stocks you’ve pledged to secure a debt, alimony, child support, and 
recurring job-related expenses that you pay (such as union dues or child-
care costs), and so on. 
You don’t have to disclose money received for alimony or child support if you don’t 
want that money included in the lender’s calculations of whether you can repay 
the loan. If you want them included, you need to supply a copy of the court order 
that mandates the payments and proof that you’re getting them, such as bank 
statements showing regular deposits.
Page 26 shows you how to create a household budget. Use that budget to get 
your current monthly housing expenses.

Choose and Apply for a Mortgage
211
For each debt, list the name and address of the creditor, your account 
number, how much you pay each month, how much time remains on the 
loan, and your current balance. If you’re selling your current home, mark 
any debts that the sale will pay off with an asterisk (*).
Section VII: Details of Transaction
This section details the total cost to buy the house. In the first part, add up 
all the costs related to the transaction:
•	 Purchase price
•	 Alterations, improvements, repairs
•	 Land (if you’re buying the land separately—otherwise, it’s included in 
the purchase price)
•	 Refinance (if you’re refinancing your current home rather than pur-
chasing a new one, this is the amount you’re refinancing, including 
any liens that must be paid off)
•	 Estimated prepaid items
•	 Estimated closing costs
•	 PMI
•	 Discount (any points you’re paying)
From the total of those costs, subtract the loan amount, any secondary 
financing (such as a second mortgage), any of your closing costs that the 
seller will pay, and other credits. The result shows an estimate of how much 
cash you need to come up with for your down payment and closing costs.
Although it’s up to you whether you want to include alimony and child support 
payments as part of your monthly income if you receive such payments, if you pay 
alimony or child support, you must include the amount you pay as a liability.
If you apply for a loan with a co-borrower, the two of you can fill out this section 
jointly if you’ve got significant joint assets and liabilities—such as joint bank ac-
counts or a loan you’ve taken out together. (This is true whether or not you and 
the co-borrower are married.) Otherwise, each of you must fill out your own Assets 
and Liabilities section and provide supporting documentation separately.
Read Chapter 9 to get an overview of typical closing costs.

Chapter 8
212
Section VIII: Declarations
The first part of this section asks you and your co-borrower to check a box 
to answer yes or no to a series of questions about your legal and financial 
situation. If either of you answers yes to any of these questions, you must 
supply more information about what’s going on—such as your alimony 
agreement (along with a copy of your divorce papers) or the circumstanc-
es of a recent bankruptcy (along the schedule you used to repay creditors 
and the discharge papers). 
Here are the questions:
•	 Are there any outstanding judgments against you? If you’ve lost a 
lawsuit and haven’t yet paid what you owe, note that here. 
•	 Have you been declared bankrupt within the past 7 years? A recent 
bankruptcy will make it harder for you to get a loan.
•	 Have you had property foreclosed upon or given title or deed in 
lieu thereof in the past 7 years? The lender wants to know if you’ve 
been unable to honor the obligations of a mortgage in the recent past.
•	 Are you a party to a lawsuit? If you’re suing someone or being sued, 
you must give the details of the lawsuit.
•	 Have you directly or indirectly been obligated on any loan that re-
sulted in foreclosure, transfer of title in lieu of foreclosure, or judg-
ment? This applies to all kinds of loans, not just mortgages, whether 
you were the primary borrower or a co-signer.
•	 Are you presently delinquent or in default on any federal debt 
or any other loan, mortgage, financial obligation, bond, or loan 
guarantee? If you are, it’s not a good time to apply for a mortgage.
•	 Are you obligated to pay alimony, child support, or separate 
maintenance? The lender requires details of any divorce or separation 
agreement under which you must pay money to the other person.
•	 Are you a co-maker or endorser on a note? A note is a promise to 
pay a specified amount on demand or at a certain time. If you have 
such an obligation, the lender wants details.
The second part of this section has two yes-or-no questions, and one ques-
tion that, if you answer yes, requires further information:
•	 Are you a U.S. citizen?
•	 Are you a permanent resident alien?

Choose and Apply for a Mortgage
213
•	 Do you intend to occupy the property as your primary residence? 
If yes, you must indicate whether you’ve owned or partially owned a 
property in the past three years. If you have, you need to give informa-
tion about the type of property (primary residence, second home, or 
investment property) and how you held title (by yourself, jointly with 
your spouse, or with someone who’s not your spouse).
Section IX: Acknowledgment and Agreement
In this section, you promise that all the information in your application is 
true and you understand that anything you said that’s false could result in 
penalties, such as a lawsuit or even criminal charges. The rest of the fine 
print says that you agree to these conditions:
•	 Everything you state in the application is for the purpose of getting a 
loan to buy residential property, and if you get the loan you’re apply-
ing for, it will be secured by a mortgage or a deed of trust. 
•	 You won’t use the property you buy with this loan for any illegal pur-
pose, and you’ll occupy the property as you state in the application 
(primary residence, second home, and so on). 
•	 Whether or not your application gets approved, the lender can keep a 
copy for its records.
•	 If information you provided on the application changes, you’ll update 
the lender about the change.
•	 If you get the loan and fall behind in your payments, the lender can 
report that information to the credit bureaus.
•	 The lender can sell your loan to someone else.
•	 The lender isn’t responsible for the condition of the property you’re 
buying.
•	 If you submit the application electronically, your electronic signature is 
as legally binding as your pen-and-ink signature.
Don’t try to fudge—or worse, lie about—anything on the application. That’s fraud, 
and it’s against the law. Even if the lender doesn’t catch your fibs during the ap-
plication process, those misstatements can come back to haunt you later. If you lie 
to get a bigger mortgage than you can afford, for example, and end up in default, 
the lender may press criminal fraud charges against you.

Chapter 8
214
Section X: Information for Government Monitoring Purposes
The government checks up on lenders to make sure that they’re following 
federal laws about fair housing and equal credit opportunity for certain 
kinds of loans. That’s what this optional section is for. It collects informa-
tion about your sex, race, and ethnicity that the government uses to check 
lenders’ compliance with those laws. If you prefer not to provide this infor-
mation, check the box that says, “I do not wish to furnish this information.”
Authorization to Verify Your Information
After you fill out the mortgage application, the lender will probably ask you 
to sign another form, giving the lender permission to check your informa-
tion. By signing this form, you agree to give the lender access to information 
related to your application, including your credit history, employment his-
tory, bank accounts, and information about past mortgages. 
HUD Settlement Cost Booklet
By law, your lender must give you a copy of the booklet titled, Shopping 
for Your Home Loan. It contains information about the home-buying and fi-
nancing process: deciding to buy a home, finding the home you want, shop-
ping and applying for a loan, understanding what your loan will cost you, 
and how closing works. If you don’t get a copy of this booklet, ask for it.
Truth-in-Lending Disclosure Statement
After you apply for a loan, the lender must give you a Truth-in-Lending 
(TIL) disclosure statement. The TIL statement spells out the costs associ-
ated with your loan:
•	 Annual percentage rate (APR). This expresses the totality of your 
loan costs: its interest rate plus various lender fees and closing costs. 
Page 153 tells you more about APRs.
•	 Finance charge. This tells you, in dollars and cents, how much the 
loan will cost you if you pay it off over its full term.
•	 Amount financed. Confirm that this is the amount that you’re borrowing.
If you choose not to give the information requested in this section and you applied 
for the loan in person, the lender is required by law to look you over, check out 
your last name—and make a guess about your sex, race, and ethnicity.

Choose and Apply for a Mortgage
215
•	 Total payments. This amount shows you how much you’ll pay in prin-
cipal and interest over the full term of the loan.
•	 Other information about your loan. Your TIL statement notes other 
information about this loan, such as whether it has a variable rate (if 
so, you get a separate ARM disclosure), whether there’s a prepayment 
penalty, whether the loan is assumable, whether the lender can de-
mand payment in full on a certain date (for a balloon loan, page 173), 
and what filing fees and late charges are.
Because some of the information on your TIL statement can change be-
tween the time you apply and the time you close (or lock in your rate), the 
lender must give you a revised TIL statement before closing.
ARM Disclosure Statement
If your loan has an adjustable rate (page 164), you’ll also get an ARM disclo-
sure statement to make sure you understand how these loans work. This 
disclosure, which you should receive with the application form, is a writ-
ten summary of the terms and costs of your loan. The ARM disclosure also 
includes an overview of the past performance of the index to which your 
loan is tied (page 215 explains how that works), and a copy of the Federal 
Reserve Board’s Consumer Handbook on Adjustable-Rate Mortgages.
Good Faith Estimate
The Good Faith Estimate (GFE) describes your loan and how much it costs 
(to get a copy of the form so you can follow along with the discussion be-
low, see this book’s Missing CD at www.missingmanuals.com/cds/). In 2009, 
HUD revised the form to make it easier to understand and easier to com-
pare the costs listed here with the HUD-1 form you receive at the closing 
(see page 325 for information on the HUD-1 form). Another improvement: 
Lenders must stick by this estimate. The fees the lender charges to origi-
nate and process your loan cannot change between the time you receive 
the GFE and the closing. (Some third-party costs, over which the lender has 
no control, can change.) Holding lenders to their estimated loan origina-
tion fees prevents those fees from increasing and junk fees from creeping 
in. HUD estimates that the new GFE rules will save the average borrower 
$700 in closing costs.
Your GFE won’t do you much good, though, if you don’t understand what’s 
on it. This section takes you through the three-page form and explains 
each part.

Chapter 8
216
Purpose
This section simply tells you what this GFE is for: to set out the loan’s terms 
and estimate the closing costs you’ll pay if the lender approves your loan.
Shopping for your loan
Here, you’re advised that you can use GFEs to compare loans and find the 
one that works best for you. The section directs your attention to the shop-
ping chart on page 3, which helps you do a straightforward comparison of 
the loans you’re considering. (More on how to use the shopping chart in a 
moment.)
Important dates
Your GFE doesn’t last indefinitely, so pay attention to this section, because 
it lists expiration and other important dates:
•	 When the quoted interest rate expires. After the date listed here, the 
interest rate and other charges may change until you lock in the rate.
•	 When the other quoted closing costs expire
•	 If you lock in your rate, how long the rate lock lasts
•	 The number of days before closing at which you must lock in your rate
Summary of your loan
Here’s the meat and potatoes of your loan, the basics spelled out clearly for 
you. Read it carefully, paying attention to the following:
•	 Your initial loan amount. This is how much you’re borrowing.
•	 The term of your loan. This states how many years you have to pay 
back the loan.
•	 Your initial interest rate. This line says “initial” even for fixed-rate 
loans. A couple of lines later, the form spells out whether the interest 
rate is fixed or adjustable.
•	 Your initial monthly payment, including principal, interest, and 
mortgage insurance (if required). Again, this line talks about “initial” 
payments for all loans; the next line identifies whether your loan is 
fixed-rate or an ARM.
To make sure that you get the rate listed on your GFE, lock in that rate as soon as 
possible.

Choose and Apply for a Mortgage
217
•	 Can your interest rate rise? If No is checked, you have a fixed-rate 
loan. If Yes is checked, the lender must specify the highest possible 
interest rate and the date of the first rate change.
•	 Can your loan balance rise? If No is checked, your monthly payments 
will chip away at the loan’s balance. If Yes, your loan is subject to nega-
tive amortization (page 168) and the lender must specify how high the 
balance can get—it may be as high as 125% of the amount you origi-
nally borrowed, so pay attention to any number that appears here.
•	 Can your monthly amount for principal, interest, and mortgage 
insurance rise? Again, fixed-rate loans will have No checked here. If 
your loan is an ARM, you’ll see a checkmark in the Yes box and a dollar 
amount for how much your monthly principal and interest payments 
can rise—both for the first adjustment period and if interest rates hit 
the maximum allowed by your loan.
•	 Prepayment penalty. If your lender doesn’t impose one, you’ll see the 
No box checked. If there is a penalty, Yes is checked and you’ll see the 
maximum amount it would cost you to pay off the loan early.
•	 Balloon payment. If you take out a balloon loan (page 173), which 
becomes due in full after a certain period of time, this section tells you 
how much you have to pay and when it’s due.
The information in this section should match what’s on your Truth-in-
Lending statement. Compare them to make sure, and ask about any dis-
crepancies.
Escrow account information
As you saw in Chapter 1, PITI—your monthly payment—stands for princi-
pal, interest, taxes, and insurance. All lenders collect principal, interest, and 
any required PMI via your monthly payments. Some lenders leave prop-
erty taxes and other insurance up to you. Many lenders, however, want to 
protect their financial interest in your home by making sure that your tax 
and insurance payments stay up to date. These lenders estimate what your 
annual tax and insurance charges will be and collect 1/12 of these charges 
with your monthly payment. That money goes into an escrow account; 
when the charges are due, the lender pays them on your behalf from that 
escrow account.
If your loan has a prepayment penalty, ask whether that penalty is hard (you’ll pay 
it whether you sell the house or refinance) or soft (you’ll pay it only if you refinance 
the loan).

Chapter 8
218
This section of the GFE tells you whether or not this lender requires you to 
pay taxes and insurance fees into escrow. If so, you get an estimate of how 
much tax and interest payments will add to your monthly principal and 
interest payments for the first year of your loan. 
Understanding your estimated settlement charges
At the bottom of page 1, you see an overview of what your closing costs 
will be:
•	 A: Origination charges. This amount shows the administrative fees 
your lender charges for making the loan (see page 227 for an explana-
tion of the fees).
•	 B: All other settlement services. This amount is an estimate of the 
charges and fees due at the closing that don’t go to the lender.
Page 2 breaks down these amounts, so you can see exactly what goes into 
them. For the origination fees, which cannot change at the closing, the 
lender spells out these charges:
•	 Origination charge. This gives the dollar amount that the lender 
charges to make your loan.
•	 Adjustments. This section details how origination charges affect your 
interest rate. You may be paying a slightly higher interest rate and low-
er up-front closing costs or higher closing costs to get a lower rate.
The rest of page 2 explains other required settlement charges and esti-
mates how much these will cost you at closing. Some of these charges may 
vary from what’s estimated here (you’ll find out which ones in a minute). 
Here’s how these charges break down:
•	 Required services that we select. These charges may include an ap-
praisal fee, credit check fee, and other services that the lender needs to 
process your loan. The lender lists the service and how much it costs.
•	 Title services and lender’s title insurance. Here the lender estimates 
the cost of the title search and the lender’s title insurance policy you 
must buy.
•	 Owner’s title insurance. It’s up to you whether you want to buy title 
insurance to protect yourself if someone challenges the title after clos-
ing. (Page 269 tells you more about owner’s title insurance.)
•	 Required services that you can shop for. The lender may require 
certain services, such as a home inspection, but not dictate who must 
perform that service. Such services are outlined here, along with an 
estimated cost for each.

Choose and Apply for a Mortgage
219
•	 Government recording charges. As page 232 explains, the govern-
ment charges a fee to record documents related to your home purchase.
•	 Transfer taxes. These state and local taxes (page 232) vary widely; this 
line tells you how much you’ll pay in your area.
•	 Initial deposit for your escrow account. If the lender collects money 
for taxes and insurance and holds the funds in escrow, this section tells 
you how much and what it’s for.
•	 Daily interest charges. You start owing the bank interest from the mo-
ment you sign the loan documents—that means each day between 
the day you close and the day your first payment is due. The lender cal-
culates the total of these daily interest charges based on an estimated 
closing date. (If the closing date changes, so will the amount.)
•	 Homeowner’s insurance. Here, the lender lists the kinds of home-
owner’s insurance you must get (hazard, flood, and earthquake insur-
ance, for example) and estimates its cost.
Understanding which charges can change at settlement
At the top of page 3, the GFE makes clear which settlement charges may 
increase between now and the closing and which must stay the same, as 
you see noted on this form:
•	 Charges that may not increase. Fixed charges include the lender’s 
origination fee listed on page 2, the number of points you agree to 
pay (after you lock in your rate), the adjusted origination charges at 
the bottom of page 1 (after you lock in your rate), and transfer taxes.
•	 Charges that may increase by a maximum of 10 percent. If you use 
any service that the lender requires or identifies, you won’t pay more 
than 10 percent above the amount estimated. (This keeps lenders 
from underestimating third-party charges from providers they require 
or recommend.) Government recording charges are also limited to no 
more than a 10 percent increase above the lender’s estimate.
•	 Charges that may change. Some charges are beyond the lender’s 
ability to estimate. If you use a third-party service, such as a home in-
spector, that you shopped for and choose yourself—without any in-
put from the lender—the charge for that service may be higher than 
what the lender thinks it should cost. Homeowner’s insurance rates 
and your initial escrow deposit (if required) are other charges that may 
be higher than the lender’s best guess. Finally, the lender bases the es-
timate of the daily interest charge on a hypothetical closing date—you 
may end up closing on a different date, which will increase or decrease 
that daily interest charge, depending on whether it’s closer to or fur-
ther away from the date of your first scheduled payment.

Chapter 8
220
Using the tradeoff table
One question that makes homebuyers scratch their heads is, “Should I pay 
points to get a lower interest rate, or should I go for lower closing costs?” To 
help you see the difference between paying points to get a lower interest 
rate (which means higher up-front closing costs) and minimizing closing 
costs with a higher interest rate (which means you spread out the higher 
rate over the life of the loan, paying more interest in the long run), your 
GFE includes a tradeoff table. It gives you three versions of the loan side 
by side, so you can compare interest rates, monthly principal and interest 
payments, and total closing costs for three variations of the loan:
•	 The loan as quoted in this GFE
•	 The loan with a higher interest rate and lower closing costs
•	 The loan with higher closing costs (discount points) and a lower inter-
est rate
The table is well-named. It clearly shows the tradeoff you make when:
•	 You opt for a lower interest rate by prepaying some interest at the

Using the shopping chart
You may request GFEs from several lenders to compare the loans they of-
fer. If you do, the shopping chart, which appears on page 3 of the GFE, lets 
you lay out the main points of each loan for an easy, at-a-glance compari-
son. Here’s what the shopping chart might look like if you’re in the market

As you compare loans, you may notice that Loan 4 costs $56.70 less a 
month than Loan 1, but it requires an extra $825 at closing. If you have the 
$825, it would take about 15 months for the lower monthly payments of 
Loan 4 to recoup that up-front investment. After those 15 months, Loan 4 
would be cheaper thanks to the lower interest rate. If you don’t have that 
extra money now, one of the other options might look more attractive.
The point of the shopping chart is to let you compare different loans to see 
which best meets your needs. Only you can balance affordable payments 
with affordable closing costs to choose the loan that’s right for you.
If you choose an ARM, the tradeoff table shows only your interest rate and monthly 
payments for the initial, fixed-rate period of the loan. It cannot predict what your 
rate or monthly payments will be when your rate adjusts in the future.

Chapter 8
222
If your loan is sold in the future 
The last section of your GFE is a notification that the lender may sell your 
loan after closing. (If that happens, the company that buys your loan can-
not change its terms.)
Mortgage Servicing Disclosure Statement
Federal law requires lenders to give you a mortgage servicing disclosure 
statement. This document tells you whether your lender intends to keep 
your loan after closing, servicing the loan itself, or sell it to an investor. As 
your GFE emphasizes, if another institution buys your loan, it must honor 
the loan’s terms. 
Keep your GFE and bring it with you to the closing. If there are any discrepancies 
between it and the HUD-1 form that shows your final closing costs, you’ll have the 
GFE right there to help you set things right.

Frequently Asked Question
What to Do If the Lender Rejects Your Application
I applied for a loan—and got turned down. What can I do now?
In the mid-2000s, it seemed like anyone and his dog could get a mortgage. But 
thanks to the credit crunch that began in late 2008, lenders have made it much 
harder to qualify for a loan. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, by mid-
2009 about half of all mortgage loan applicants were being turned down. If it hap-
pens to you, there are steps you can take that may help you get the loan you want.
First, find out why the lender rejected your application. If you submitted a formal 
application (as opposed to having an informal conversation with a loan officer), 
the lender must give you an adverse action notice explaining why you were turned 
down. Common reasons include an appraisal that came in too low, problems with 
your credit history, too much other debt, or an employment history that the lender 
sees as unstable. 
Depending on the lender’s reason (or reasons) for turning you down, you may be 
able to take action to turn the tide:
•	 If the lender’s appraisal was too low, request that the lender consider a 
second appraisal. Back up your request with information about recent sales of 
comparable homes. If the original appraiser wasn’t local to your area, the lender 
may listen to a local appraiser. 
•	 Check your credit report for errors. If the lender rejected you based on a cred-
it report, it must tell you which bureau’s report it used. You can then get a copy 
of your credit report from that bureau and correct any errors. If there aren’t any 
mistakes, work to improve your credit score (page 39) to reduce the chances 
that you’ll be disappointed the next time you apply.
•	 Negotiate with the lender. If you get turned down for loan with, say, a 4.5 per-
cent interest rate, you may qualify to borrow the same amount at a higher rate. 
Or you may qualify if you can find the funds for a higher down payment (which 
means you borrow less). Work with your loan originator to see if you can tweak 
the loan so you’ll qualify. 
•	 Try another lender. Many homebuyers find that smaller, community-based in-
stitutions, such as savings and loans or credit unions, are more flexible than big 
commercial lenders.
Getting preapproved for a loan (page 34) makes your chances of getting final ap-
proval more likely. The lender may still reject the loan based on problems with the 
property or title or changes in your financial picture (such as taking on a big new 
debt or changing your job). But getting preapproved gives you a degree of cer-
tainty that the lender will approve your formal application up to a certain amount.

Costs

t’s as certain as death and taxes: Whenever a piece of real estate changes 
hands, money changes hands, too. The swap takes place at an event 
called the closing, a meeting of all the parties involved in the sale of 
a house (the lender’s attorney, the owner’s representative, and you and/
or your representative). There, you sign a dauntingly large stack of papers 
that bind you to the terms of your mortgage and make the property trans-
fer official. Then you review the closing costs (sometimes called settlement 
costs), the fees and charges involved in the sale. There’s quite a list of them; 
you pay some and the seller pays others. (Chapter 13 gives you a step-by-
step tour of a real estate closing so you know what to expect.)
Closing costs can add up fast, but lenders provide you with an estimate 
of them beforehand. So you’ll have an accurate list of the costs you can 
use to plan ahead. In this chapter, you’ll get an overview of the different 
kinds of closing costs: those related to your mortgage, those related to the 
property transfer, and those that go to the government. You’ll also see how 
these costs add up at a typical closing—and get tips for keeping them to 
a minimum.

Chapter 9
226
Kinds of Closing Costs
Closing costs fall into three categories:
•	 Costs related to getting your mortgage
•	 Costs related to transferring ownership of the property
•	 Government taxes and fees
Costs Related to Your Mortgage
After you fork over the down payment on your new house (see Chapter 6), 
the bulk of your one-time costs come down to the fees required to get 
your mortgage approved. You’ll find a list of the fees below, but keep in 
mind that every mortgage is different—you won’t always pay all of these 
costs, and as time goes on, lenders will probably add new ones, not listed 
here:
•	 Application fee. This is the fee you pay for the lender to consider your 
mortgage application. If you don’t pay an application fee when you 
apply for a mortgage, you’ll pay it as part of some other fee. Applica-
tion fees average $250 but vary by lender and region.
•	 Credit check. Lenders pass along the cost of checking your credit to 
you. Sometimes, they include this charge in the mortgage application 
fee. If not, expect to pay $30 to $35. On the bright side, your lender 
has to give you a copy of the report, so you get something tangible in 
return.
Take closing costs into account when you decide what to offer for a home. And 
remember that many of these fees are negotiable; a seller eager to close a deal 
may kick in some money toward closing costs. It never hurts to ask. See “Reduce 
Your Closing Costs” on page 236.
When you see an ad for a no-application-fee loan, be skeptical. There’s no such 
thing as a free lunch—or a free loan. When you apply for a loan that advertises 
“no application fees,” you may find yourself reaching for your checkbook to pay a 
document processing fee, an appraisal fee, or a credit-check fee. Sounds a lot like 
an application fee, doesn’t it? By the way, you pay these fees whether or not the 
lender approves your loan.

Know Your Closing Costs 
227
•	 Appraisal fee. To make sure your house is worth what you’re paying 
for it, lenders require you to hire an independent third party to deter-
mine its fair market value. The lender chooses the appraiser, but you 
pay the fee, which can run anywhere from $200 to $400.
•	 Loan origination fee. This nebulously named fee covers administra-
tive aspects of the mortgage process: setting up the file for your loan, 
entering the loan into the lender’s books, and preparing the docu-
ments necessary to offer and execute your mortgage (the bank’s es-
timate of closing costs, for example, and the terms of your mortgage).
It also covers the underwriter’s fee. The underwriter certifies, based on 
the numbers presented to him, that both you and the property you’re 
buying are an acceptable risk for the bank. In other words, he deter-
mines whether it’s likely that you’ll pay back your mortgage and certi-
fies that if you don’t, the property in question equals the value of the 
bank’s investment. Page 162 tells you more about the underwriter’s 
role in evaluating your mortgage application.
And finally, the origination fee pays the commission of the loan officer 
or broker who initiated and completed the loan transaction.
Expect to pay a loan origination fee of between 1 and 2 percent of the 
amount you’re borrowing. If you’re borrowing $275,000, you’ll pay in 
the range of $2,750 to $5,500.
•	 Points. Points, too, can be a murky concept because lenders use the 
word in a couple of ways. But no matter how they apply it, the defini-
tion remains constant: One point equals 1 percent of your loan. If your 
loan is $250,000, 1 point is $2,500.
Lenders use points a couple of ways:
—
— To express the “price” of your loan origination fee (“Acme Bank 
charges a loan origination fee of 2 points”, for example)
Some lenders bundle together the application fee, credit check, and appraisal fee 
into one charge, calling it a document processing fee (or something similar).
Like an undercover spy, the loan origination fee has several different aliases. Your 
lender may call it a processing fee, an administrative fee, an underwriting fee, an 
origination fee, or something similar.

Chapter 9
228
—
— To boost the financial interest you have in your house. If your down 
payment is less than 20 percent and your credit score is below 640 
or so (the number varies with different lenders), your lender may 
require you to pay a point or two up front. In this case, points are 
interest that you’re paying in advance. Your lender wants some as-
surance that he’ll get a good return on the investment he’s mak-
ing in your home. If you’re unable to provide that assurance with 
a sizable down payment, the lender may insist on collecting some 
interest in advance in the form of points.
On the other hand, you may volunteer to pay some points up front to 
reduce the interest rate of your mortgage (lenders call these points 
discount points). Discount points are also prepaid interest. In this case, 
paying extra interest in advance lowers your loan’s interest rate, which 
in turn lowers your monthly payments and the total amount of your 
loan. If you have the money to pay points, as the practice is called, you 
can substantially reduce the amount of interest you pay over the life 
of your loan. For example, if you’re borrowing $275,000 with a 30-year 
fixed-rate loan, you might have a choice between paying no points 
and getting an interest rate of 5 percent or paying 1 point and lower-
ing your interest rate to 4.75 percent. The following table shows how 
paying $2,750 up front can save you more than $15,000 over the life 
of the loan:

•	 Prorated interest. Although you won’t have to make your first mort-
gage payment until four to six weeks after you close on your house, 
you start owing interest as soon as you sign your name on the dotted 
line. The lender figures out the interest between the date of your clos-
ing and your first mortgage payment, and you pay that at the closing.
The trick to knowing whether it’s worthwhile to pay points is to find the break-
even point, where the money you save in interest payments pays back the dis-
count points you paid at the start of the loan. If you plan to stay in your home past 
the break-even point, you’ll save money on interest. Page 158 shows you how to 
calculate a loan’s break-even point. 

Know Your Closing Costs 
229
•	 Private mortgage insurance. If your down payment is less than 20 
percent of your home’s purchase price, you have to buy private mort-
gage insurance (see page 146) and pay for it annually until you accrue 
20 percent equity in your house. You’ll most likely pay the first year’s 
PMI in a lump sum at the closing; after that, the lender takes the an-
nual premium out of an escrow account it sets up and that your mort-
gage payments fund (see “Escrow fund” on the next page). The cost of 
PMI depends on several factors, including your credit score and the 
amount of your mortgage, but it most often falls in the range of 0.5 to 
1 percent of your loan. 
•	 Government agency fees. If the FHA insures your mortgage or if the 
Veterans Administration guarantees it (see Chapter 7 for details on 
government-assisted loans), you need to pay the associated premium 
or fee at the closing. The FHA premium is about 1.5 percent of your 
loan. VA guarantee fees range from 1.25 percent to 2 percent of your 
loan and depend on the size of your down payment—the bigger it is, 
the lower your percentage. 
•	 Survey. The lender may want to survey your property to verify the 
property lines and the locations of the house and any other buildings 
on it. The survey also checks for encroachments, such as a neighbor’s 
fence that strays onto your property or a corner of your garage that 
juts onto the neighbor’s property (you have to resolve any encroach-
ment issues before the closing). The survey should cost $150 to $400.
•	 Home inspection fee. Your lender wants to be sure that the home 
you’re buying is in good shape—that you’re not buying a ready-to-
collapse nightmare, in other words. You’ll probably have to pay a pro-
fessional home inspector to check the home’s structure and central 
systems (electric, heating, septic, and so on). Of course, it’s in your best 
interest to give the home a thorough going-over, too, so you’ll prob-
ably find this fee easy to swallow. Costs vary depending on where you 
live and the size of your house, but expect to pay $200 to $400. Chap-
ter 12 walks you through a typical home inspection.
Federal law requires that your lender automatically cancel your PMI when the 
equity in your house reaches 22 percent. You can request cancellation of PMI at 20 
percent equity; if you do, the bank will probably require you to pay for an appraisal 
to prove the home’s value.

Chapter 9
230
•	 Pest inspection fee. In addition to the home inspection, your lender 
may require a separate pest inspection that checks for wood-boring 
insects like termites and powder-post beetles. Usually, you have to get 
this inspection done within 30 days before the closing. Depending on 
the size and age of the house, this inspection typically costs from $75 
to $200.  
•	 Insurance costs. A homeowner’s insurance policy protects you from 
the costs of vandalism, fire, wind, and other damage to your property. 
It also covers the contents of your home in cases of theft and damage. 
And it protects you if someone gets injured on your property. In flood-
prone areas of the country, such as many coastal regions, your lender 
requires you to get a separate flood insurance policy. 
At the closing, you must prove you have a homeowner’s policy in effect 
(condo and co-op buyers, see the Note below). The cost of the insur-
ance depends on the value of your home and its location (high-crime 
areas or places with extreme weather mean a more costly policy), but 
the national average is $760 a year.
•	 Escrow fund. Some lenders require you to set aside money to pay 
recurring fees associated with your mortgage—homeowner’s insur-
ance, hazard insurance, PMI (if any), and property taxes. The lender 
holds this money in an escrow account, a separate account set up on 
your behalf to hold funds that pay these fees when they’re due. You 
may have to deposit seed money into your escrow account at the clos-
ing. After that, the lender takes the fee payments out of your monthly 
mortgage payment.
•	 Miscellaneous charges. You may have to pay for various other fees 
at the closing, including courier fees to shuttle papers between the 
lender and the lawyers; brokerage fees (if you use a mortgage broker 
to find your lender); prorated fees for utilities, condo fees, and home-
owners’ association dues; an assumption fee (if you’re taking over the 
seller’s mortgage; page 190 tells you about assumable mortgages); 
flood certification (to check whether the home requires flood insur-
ance); wire transfer fees; and so on.
If you buy a condo or co-op, part of your monthly common charges (condo) or 
maintenance fees (co-op) goes toward hazard insurance for the building. You’re 
covered for structural damage but not for the contents of your home; be sure to 
buy your own homeowner’s policy to protect the latter.

231
Costs Related to Transferring Ownership
You want to make sure that the home you’re buying is all yours, and to do 
that, you have to be sure that the seller actually owns the property he’s 
selling and that he has the right to transfer ownership to you. So expect to 
pay these costs:
•	 Title search. Someone has to go through public records to prove that 
the seller has the legal right to sell you her home—they have to show 
that no one has an outstanding claim of ownership against the prop-
erty and that no one has placed a lien (a financial claim) against it. 
Any one of several parties may conduct the title search: the insurance 
company, a title company, an escrow company, or a lawyer. Whoever 
does it looks through local government records, including those for 
the county courts, tax assessor, surveyors, and the recorder of deeds. 
In addition, the person conducting the search needs to look for and 
examine records related to liens, divorces, deaths, and contested wills 
that might affect ownership. 
•	 Lender’s title insurance. Even with a vetted title, most lenders want a 
guarantee that no errors were made during the search. That guarantee 
comes in the form of title insurance. If someone later makes a claim 
against the property, title insurance protects the lender’s investment 
(the money it loaned you). This insurance is a one-time fee based on 
the amount you borrow; it’s usually 0.5 percent of your home’s pur-
chase price. And the lender doesn’t pay for it—you do. Like many clos-
ing costs, however, you may be able to negotiate with the seller to pay 
this fee.
Your lender may require you to prove that you have several months’ worth of mort-
gage payments in the bank at the closing. This isn’t a closing cost but an assurance 
that you have sufficient funds to meet the next several mortgage payments. Even 
if your lender doesn’t require this, it’s a good idea to set aside the equivalent of a 
few months’ payments in an emergency fund.
If the seller has owned her house for just a few years, contact the seller’s title insur-
ance company and ask them to reissue the seller’s title insurance policy in your 
name. If the property changed hands fairly recently and no claims have surfaced 
against the title, the current title insurance company may consider the property a 
low risk and give you a favorable rate.

Chapter 9
232
•	 Owner’s title insurance (optional). The title insurance you buy to 
protect the lender’s interests doesn’t protect yours. Some home buy-
ers buy title insurance for themselves as well. Usually, this is a percent-
age of the lender’s insurance policy. And in some areas, it’s customary 
for the seller to buy title insurance for the new owner.
•	 Settlement fees. Someone has to prepare the paperwork and con-
duct the closing proceedings, making sure all those legal t’s and i’s are 
crossed and dotted. The settlement agent may be a lawyer, a real es-
tate broker, a representative of the lender, or an escrow company, and 
it may be your responsibility to pay his services. In addition, you may 
want to hire your own attorney to keep an eye on your interests at the 
closing (page 99 explains why this is a good idea).
Government Taxes and Fees
The seller isn’t the only one who wants proceeds from the sale of her 
house—so does the government. The taxes and fees you pay to city, 
county, and state agencies depend on where you buy. In some parts of the 
country, the amount is negligible. In others, it represents a big chunk of 
your closing costs, sometimes in the thousands of dollars. Here are some 
typical taxes and fees:
•	 Property tax. As soon as you own a home, you’re liable for its property 
taxes. The amount you owe at closing depends on when your com-
munity collects its property taxes. You might owe the seller a prorated 
amount for property taxes she’s already paid, for example.
•	 Transfer and recording tax. This is a transaction fee the government 
charges to transfer the property’s title from the seller to you. It’s a per-
centage of the property’s selling price. Usually, this is a local tax, paid 
to your new city or county (or both), but some states charge this tax, 
too. 
•	 Mansion tax. Some states levy a luxury tax on homes worth more 
than a certain amount of money. New York state, for example, adds 1 
percent to the recording tax of homes valued at more than a million 
dollars.

Wizard to compare title insurance companies and rates. You can find it at http://

•	 Recording fee. This fee pays for recording your house’s deed and 
mortgage in local records. The amount often depends on the number 
of pages in the deed.

return, but ask your accountant or tax preparer if you can deduct them from state 
and local returns.

Chapter 9
234
As you can see, closing costs vary widely. Your down payment and the size 
of your mortgage affect the fees. Other factors include the home’s location, 
your credit score, your mortgage interest rate, whether you buy points to 
reduce that rate, and the lender’s policies. As a rule of thumb, most buyers 
pay closing costs of 3 to 6 percent of the loan amount.
How Much Will You Pay?
Even setting aside 3 to 6 percent of the loan amount for closing costs you 
might worry whether you’ll have enough cash at the closing. Fear not. 
When you apply for a loan, federal law requires that, within three days, 
your lender give you a written estimate of those costs. To do this, the lend-
er uses a form called the Good Faith Estimate (GFE), developed by the De-
partment of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for just this purpose. 
This recently revised, three-page document helps you compare loans from 
the same or different lenders and understand the total closing costs you’ll 
pay. Chapter 8 goes through a GFE section by section. Here, you get an 
overview of how the GFE estimates your closing costs. 
The Good Faith Estimate isn’t just the lender’s best guess at your closing 
costs—it’s a realistic estimate that comes surprisingly close to the true fig-
ures. That’s because federal regulations dictate the degree to which clos-
ing costs can increase. For example, the following costs cannot be higher 
at the closing than they are on your GFE:
•	 The loan origination fee
•	 The points required for the given interest rate (after you lock in your 
interest rate—see page 204 to learn how to do that)
•	 Transfer taxes
According to a 2009 survey by BankRate.com, the average closing costs nationally 
were $2,732 (based on a $200,000 loan). Texas homebuyers shelled out the highest 
fees  at $3,855, and Nevada buyers spent the least at $2,276. Find average closing 
costs for your state by visiting www.bankrate.com and type closing costs into the 
search box in the upper-right corner of the page.

The following third-party charges may increase before closing, but not by 
more than 10 percent:
•	 Required services, such as an appraisal (your bank selects the provider)
•	 The title search
•	 Title insurance
•	 Government recording fees
Other charges in the GFE may change by more than 10 percent:
•	 Homeowner’s insurance, which is between you and your insurance 
company
•	 The amount of the initial deposit into your escrow account (that’s be-
cause the date of the closing may change between the time the lender 
creates the GFE and the day you actually close)
•	 Daily interest charges (ditto)
The GFE also lets you compare the trade-offs you make when you choose 
lower closing costs now (which result in paying more over the life of the 
loan) over a lower interest rate (which results in higher closing costs but a 
lower overall cost). 
To compare loans, use the worksheet on page 3 of the GFE, called the 
“shopping chart.” Fill in the figures from different lenders and compare 
them. You’ll get a clear picture of the closing costs with a quick, accurate 
comparison. 
The 10 percent cap on third-party charges applies only to third parties that the 
lender specifically requires or recommends. For some services, such as an ap-
praiser or home inspector, the lender may let you shop around—but if you choose 
a provider that’s not on the lender’s recommended list, the amount you pay for the 
service could exceed the amount shown on the Good Faith Estimate by more than 
10 percent.
A couple of days before the closing, check with your lawyer or closing agent to get 
the actual amount you’ll need to bring with you on the big day. Chapter 13 gives 
you a blow-by-blow description of a typical closing.

Reduce Your Closing Costs
Once you add up all the closing costs, you might be shocked by the total. 
Many of these costs are negotiable, however. Try the tips below to see if 
you can rein in your spending. Whether you save a few bucks or a few hun-
dred, that’s money in your pocket.
•	 Compare lenders. Lenders aren’t required to give you a Good Faith 
Estimate until after you apply for a loan, but ask for an informal esti-
mate beforehand. Some lenders may refuse, but many will give you 
a ballpark figure. Compare them to get the best deal. Just remember 
that any estimate a lender gives you as you shop for a mortgage is just 
that—an early estimate—and it may change.
•	 Ask for a seller’s concession. If the seller agrees, you may be able to 
bundle some or all of your closing costs into your loan by getting a 
seller’s concession. Here’s how that works: Say you and the seller agree 
on a price of $175,000 for the house and you request a seller’s con-
cession of 3 percent, or $5,250. If the seller agrees (and your lender 
approves), you add that $5,250 to the price of the house, and the 
lender determines the mortgage based on a sale price $180,250. (For 
this to work, the property appraisal must match or exceed the actual 
sale price—$175,000 in the example—plus the concession amount.) 
At closing, the seller gets her $175,000 and gives you back the $5,250 
concession—and you use that money to pay some or all of your clos-
ing costs.
•	 Negotiate with the seller. When a seller is eager to sell—you may be 
shopping in a buyer’s market, for example, or the seller may be in a 
hurry to move—you can often get help with closing costs. It’s in the 
seller’s best interest to complete the sale, after all, and many sellers 
won’t quibble over a few hundred (or even a few thousand) dollars if 
the alternative is a house that stays on the market. For example, the 
seller may offer a credit of a few hundred dollars to replace the family 
room carpet or agree to a clause in your purchase agreement that says, 
“The seller agrees to pay up to $2,000 of the buyer’s closing costs.” Your 
real estate agent will help with these negotiations.
Most lenders won’t let you profit from a seller’s concession. Although you can 
use that borrowed money to pay closing costs, you can’t take the cash, say, “Hey, 
thanks!” and head off to St. Bart’s.

Know Your Closing Costs 
237
•	 Negotiate with the lender. You may find that a lender has some wig-
gle room with its charges. Ask if there’s anything your lender can do to 
pare down your overall closing costs. 
•	 Don’t pay for two attorneys. You need a lawyer to represent your in-
terests when you buy a home. If you choose one from the lender’s list 
of approved real estate attorneys, that attorney can work for both you 
and the lender and save you several hundred dollars in the process. If 
you prefer to use your own attorney because you’re worried about a 
potential conflict of interest, you can request that the lender remove 
its attorney’s fee from the closing costs you pay (the lender may or may 
not agree, but it doesn’t hurt to ask).
•	 Question individual fees. Mortgage closing costs are infamous for 
“junk fees,” additional processing and documentation charges that do 
little for you besides remove money from your wallet. For example, if 
you notice an application fee, processing fee, and underwriting fee all 
listed as closing costs, you may be paying twice for the same service. 
If a fee seems redundant or you don’t understand it, ask about it—and 
see whether you can get it waived.
•	 Compare third-party services. A lender may give you a list of ap-
proved third-party service providers—appraisers, home inspectors, 
title insurance companies, and so on. Don’t pick the first name on the 
list. Take some time and do your research; call several providers and 
ask for estimates, then compare costs. 
•	 Time your closing to save money. One of the costs you pay at the 
closing is interest on your loan (page 228). Mortgage loans are due 
on the first of each month, so at the closing you prepay interest from 
the date of the closing until the end of the current month. If you close 
on (or near) the last day of the month, you’ll owe little or no prepaid 
interest—a strategy that can reduce your closing costs by hundreds of 
dollars.
•	 Scrutinize your settlement statement in advance. The settlement 
statement, called a HUD-1 form (see page 325), itemizes all the costs 
associated with your mortgage. By law, your lender has to give you this 
form at least one day before the closing—although it’s not unusual for 
the various parties to tweak the statement until the moment every-
thing is signed. Grab your HUD-1 in advance, sit down, and compare it 
to your Good Faith Estimate. Take the time to check for discrepancies 
and bring any to your lender’s attention.

10	 Make an Offer
I
t’s an exciting moment—you found a home you love, and you’re ready 
to make an offer. You’re ready to take the next step—and it’s a big 
one—on your journey from househunter to homeowner. Even in the 
midst of all the excitement, though, it’s easy to worry whether you’re 
doing things right. If you offer too much, the bank might not approve 
your loan. If you offer too little, the seller might reject the offer without 
a counteroffer from which you can negotiate. In addition, you need to 
think carefully about how to protect yourself if something goes wrong 
between now and closing.
Although you may make a verbal offer to the seller, nothing is binding un-
til you put it in writing. And a formal offer is a promise to buy. When you 
write up an offer with your real estate agent, you’re not simply feeling out 
whether the seller might sell at a certain price—you’re making a commit-
ment to buy the home. If you and the seller can work out all the details, 
the home will be yours. It’s important that you craft your offer carefully to 
make sure it reflects your desires and protects your interests. This chapter 
takes you through the process: figuring out how much you want to offer, 
deciding on the contingencies and other conditions you want to include 
in your offer, and negotiating with the seller to come to an agreement that 
both of you can live with.

Chapter 10
240
Figure Out What the Home Is Worth
The central part of any purchase offer is the proposed purchase price. You 
already know how much the seller wants for the home, but it’s called the 
“asking price” for a reason. The amount of money that the seller would like 
to get for her home is not necessarily the price at which the home will sell. 
Prices are always negotiable. Even a seller who sets a firm price and refuses 
to consider other offers may have to think again if the house sits on the 
market for a few months.
It’s up to you to evaluate the price the seller has set and decide whether 
the home is worth it. The asking price is only one part of the equation, 
however. You need to look at that price in the context of similar homes 
(both those on the market now and those that have recently sold), how 
long the home has been for sale, and how hot—or cold—the local real 
estate market is. 
Look at Recent Sales of Comparable Homes
Ask your real estate agent to pull up information on similar homes that have 
recently sold in the same neighborhood. (Real estate insiders call these sales 
comparables, or comps.) Limit your search to houses sold within the past six 
months that are similar in age, size, and number of bedrooms to the home 
you’re considering. That’s exactly what the lender’s appraiser will look at 
when he determines the house’s value.
Comps give you a price range for similar homes in the local real estate mar-
ket. Your home should be worth somewhere between the lowest-priced 
and highest-price comparable. Figure out the average price of comps, and 
compare that to the seller’s asking price. That’ll give you an idea of whether 
the seller’s asking price is too high or a bargain. 
It’s part of the human psyche—homeowners often have an inflated sense of how 
much their home is worth, so it’s common for them to set an initial asking price 
that’s too high. A seller working with a real estate agent may simply decide to 
work with the agent who suggests the highest list price—and some agents may 
inflate the asking price in order to get the listing, figuring that they can convince 
the seller to set a more reasonable price later. And a FSBO seller may not do the 
research needed to set a realistic price.

241
Compare Asking Prices to Selling Prices
How have the list prices of homes compared to their actual selling prices? 
Your agent can help you spot trends in pricing. Ask for a trend report that 
covers the past six months, comparing what properties were listed for with 
what they sold for. Are the two numbers pretty much in line, or do selling 
prices tend to be higher or lower than asking prices? How wide is the gap? 
These comparisons tell you the state of the market and help you deter-
mine an offer for the house you want. If buyers are snapping up homes 
for prices consistently higher than list prices, you may have a hard time 
convincing a seller to accept an offer below the asking price. (Individual 
circumstances vary, of course, and you may find a motivated seller who’s 
happy to consider your offer.) If, on the other hand, you notice that selling 
prices trend below list prices, you may be able to buy a house at a compa-
rable discount. For example, say that, on average, houses have sold for 3 
percent below their list prices. That trend could indicate what’s considered 
a reasonable offer in the current market: 3 percent below the asking price. 
Use Online Home Appraisal Tools
To get an idea of how much other homes in your prospective neighborhood 
are worth, check out some online appraisal tools. These websites ask you 
for the address of the home you’re interested in and estimate the value of 
neighboring homes, giving you a quick overview of comparable prices and 
even estimating the current value of the home you’re interested in. Several 
sites provide this service for free, including Domania (www.domania.com), 
RealEstateABC (www.realestateabc.com), and Zillow (www.zillow.com). Oth-
ers, such as Electronic Appraiser (www.electronicappraiser.com), Homesmart 
(www.homesmartreports.com), and RealtyTrac (www.realtytrac.com/value-
trac) offer to sell you a property valuation report; these reports range in price 
from $20 to $30. If you’re working with a real estate agent, you probably 
don’t need to pay for a valuation report. Although your agent won’t tell you 
how much to offer, she can use her comps to work with you to interpret 
numbers and trends. Your agent’s information is probably more up to date 
than what you’ll find online, as well.
Ask your agent to look at the track record of the agent who listed the house you 
want. She may be able to spot an agent-specific trend in the gap between asking 
and selling price. For example, maybe the homes listed by this agent tend to sell 
for 5 percent below the asking price. This information could give you a ballpark for 
your offer.

242
Get the Home’s Sales History
Before you make an offer on a house, get as much backstory as you can—
it’ll help you make a more informed offer. Find out:
•	 How much the seller paid. If the seller has lived in the home for years 
and years, this figure probably won’t say much about the property’s 
current value. But if he’s lived in the house for only a few years, you 
can get a good idea of how realistic his pricing is. If home prices in 
the neighborhood have remained flat or lost ground, for example, the 
home’s current price should be fairly close to what the seller paid.
•	 How much the seller owes. You can ask; the seller may or may not tell 
you. But knowing this amount can keep you from making a lowball 
offer that the seller is sure to reject. Unless the seller is in default on 
her mortgage, she’s unlikely to accept an offer that’s lower than the 
amount she owes the bank (called a short sale; page 124 tells you all 
about them). Here’s another hint you can get from this information: If 
the seller’s mortgage balance is low, she may not be in any big hurry to 
sell and will hold out for her asking price.
•	 How long the home has been on the market. Newly listed homes 
get a lot of attention, raising sellers’ hopes that they’ll get an offer that 
meets or beats the asking price. If the home hasn’t sold after a month to 
six weeks, cooling interest from buyers and an eagerness to move may 
make the seller more amenable to an offer below the initial list price. 
•	 Whether the home has been relisted. Listing agreements expire af-
ter a set time, which may be 90 days, 180 days, or even a year. When 
they do, many sellers switch agents to try and find one who does a bet-
ter job of selling the home. Sometimes, a listing that looks brand new 
is a relisting of a house that’s been on the market before and failed to 
sell. And behind the relisting, there’s probably a frustrated seller who 
wants to get the house sold. Such sellers are often willing to consider 
more aggressive offers. Your real estate agent can tell you whether a 
home has been relisted.
Take the info you get from online appraisal tools with a big grain of salt—and 
share the data you find with your real estate agent, who knows the local market 
much better than any automated valuation system ever could.
If you make an offer that’s close to the amount the seller owes on his mortgage, 
don’t expect the seller to chip in much for repairs or closing costs.

243
Take the Market’s Temperature
Is your local real estate market hot—or not? Real estate agents measure 
market “temperatures” from the seller’s point of view. If homes sell quickly 
at market price or better, the market is hot; if inventory (the number of 
unsold homes) piles up, the market is as cold as a glacier creeping down a 
mountainside.
Agents define three kinds of housing market, one of which benefits you: 
•	 Neutral market. Neither the buyer nor the seller has an advantage.
•	 Seller’s market. “Hot” markets favor sellers.
•	 Buyer’s market. “Cold” markets favor buyers.
Read on to learn more about these markets and how to make an offer suited 
to each.
Neutral market
In a neutral market, the number of buyers looking for homes balances the 
number of homes for sale. Prices are stable, and both buyer and seller are 
on an equal footing in negotiations. You’re in a neutral market when inven-
tory remains stable at about six months (see page 248 to find out how real 
estate agents calculate inventory), median prices stay stable from month 
to month, and houses sell within four to six weeks of their listing.
When you go house-hunting in a neutral market, you’re not at any par-
ticular advantage or disadvantage in negotiations. Sellers have confidence 
that new listings will sell within a couple of months, so they’re less likely to 
lower the price or make concessions. You can bide your time, as well—al-
though desirable homes will have interested buyers, it’s unlikely you’ll get 
caught up in the bidding frenzies that can roil a seller’s market. If you shop 
for a home in a neutral market, take the time you need to make a decision 
and arrive at a comfortable offer—once you’re sure, act quickly.
Seller’s market
In a seller’s market, more buyers are hunting for homes than there are 
homes to buy. As economists put it, demand exceeds supply. Active list-
ings quickly disappear from the market, and prices rise as more buyers 
compete for fewer homes.
The median price marks the dividing line between higher-priced and lower-priced 
houses; half of listings are above the median price and half are below it. Your real 
estate agent can tell you what the median price is in your area.

Chapter 10
244
Here how to tell if you’re in a seller’s market (your agent can get the num-
bers you need):
•	 Low inventory. Inventory—the number of houses on the market—is 
much lower than in previous months or years. Real estate agents con-
sider inventory low if there’s less than six months’ worth of listings on 
the market (meaning that it would take six months to sell off all cur-
rently listed homes; see the sidebar “Determining Housing Inventory” 
on page 248 for more details). 
•	 Increasing prices. Steadily increasing median prices over several 
months and list prices that are higher than comps for homes sold a 
few months ago both suggest a seller’s market.
•	 Fast-moving homes. When listings stay active for just days or a week, 
it’s a good sign for sellers, but makes things much harder for buyers. 
If you notice a new For Sale sign in your target neighborhood, only to 
see a Sale Pending sign attached to it the next time you drive by or if 
a home sells before your agent can set up a showing, be prepared to 
move fast when you decide on a home.
•	 Upward-tracking sales. When buyers are eager to buy (instead of 
browsing or feeling like they have the luxury of many homes to choose 
from), the number of completed sales increases. Homes that have 
been lingering on the market start to sell. You’ll see an upward trend in 
sales volume due to more than simple seasonal buying patterns. 
•	 Limited-time bidding. In a very hot market, some agents limit how 
long a home stays on the market by taking bids for only a specified 
period, such as a week. These listings say something like “Accepting 
bids until 5 p.m. Saturday, April 24.” At that time, the seller reviews the 
bids and makes a decision. Agents do this to create a sense of urgency 
among prospective buyers, in hopes that many bids will come in and 
that several will exceed the asking price.
Buying during a seller’s market is more challenging than at other times, 
but you can get the home you want even in a hot market (after all, sales are 
what make the market hot). These tips give you an edge:
•	 Get preapproved for a mortgage. You’ve already done this, right? 
The box on page 34 explains how preapproval helps you set a price 
range for your home and how it speeds up the home-buying process. 
In a seller’s market, submitting a preapproval letter with your offer 
shows you can close the sale fast. This may impress a seller more than 
a higher offer without preapproval letter—the seller may decide your 
offer is more solid because you already have a commitment from a 
lender.

Make an Offer
245
•	 Don’t be demanding. Although you need to include some contingen-
cies (page 251) in your offer (such as a home inspection contingency), 
don’t go overboard . For example, don’t try to get the seller to pay for 
closing costs that the buyer normally covers in your area. If the seller 
has several offers to choose from, the one with the most demands may 
go straight to the bottom of the pile.
•	 Don’t expect a counteroffer. Many buyers expect to haggle before 
agreeing on a price. They bid low, figuring that the seller will counter 
with a different, somewhat higher price. Often, that’s a smart strategy. 
But in a seller’s market, the current owner has no motivation to haggle. 
If your offer is too low, he’ll simply reject it. And if there are multiple 
offers on the home, you won’t get a second chance.
•	 Offer to close quickly. If you can be ready to close in, say, three weeks 
instead of 30 days, you might give yourself a leg up on the competi-
tion. You can speed up closing, for example, by getting preapproved 
for a mortgage and scheduling the home inspection was early as pos-
sible. Before you promise a speedy closing, though, read Chapter 11 
to find out everything you need to do between signing a purchase 
agreement and closing the sale. Don’t underestimate how much time 
you’ll need.
•	 Get earnest about earnest money. Earnest money (page 250) shows 
that you’re serious about buying the house. If you put down a sizable 
deposit—more than is customary in your area—you signal to the sell-
er that you can afford the home and that you’re not going to run away 
from the deal on freezing cold feet.
•	 Add a personal touch. When you make an offer to purchase real es-
tate, you’re making an offer to buy someone’s home—the place they 
decorated and cared for, and lived, laughed, and loved in. Many home-
owners have mixed feelings about selling their homes and moving on. 
You might be tempted to speed things up by waiving contingencies like a home 
inspection. Don’t. If you waive your right to an inspection, you may end up own-
ing a house with serious structural or other problems—with no one to blame 
but yourself. Instead of waiving the home inspection, see if you can shorten the 
window for the inspection. A standard time frame for an inspection is 17 days—
two weeks to arrange the inspection and three days to interpret the results. If 
you’ve got an inspector who’s ready to go, you can shorten that window to 10 days 
(or less) and close at least a week earlier, while still protecting yourself against a 
substandard house.

Chapter 10
246
Consider writing a personal letter to submit with your offer to let the 
seller know what you love about the house. Don’t focus on the chang-
es you’ll make; focus on your appreciation for the place that has been 
the seller’s home. A short, heartfelt letter can set you apart from other 
buyers.
If you’re shopping for a home during a seller’s market, don’t get discour-
aged. When the market is hot, you may have to make offers on several 
homes before a seller accepts one. (Avoid making multiple offer simulta-
neously, though—you could end up losing your earnest money on one of 
them if two different sellers accept your offer.) When the competition to 
buy is fierce, try not to get too emotionally attached to a particular home, 
because there’s a good chance someone else will beat your offer. Keep 
your wish-list priorities in mind and know that many properties out there 
would make a terrific home.
A hot market can also put pressure on buyers to jump in with offers before 
they’re ready. Don’t rush. A home is too large a purchase to make simply 
because you’re feeling pressured. And don’t overbid or stretch your bud-
get to its breaking point. You may be happy to get the home, but once the 
excitement dies down, you’ll regret overspending. Remember that you’ll 
be living in your new home for years, and you want your budget to be as 
comfortable as your living room.
Buyer’s market
A buyer’s market is the flip side of a seller’s market; there are more homes 
available than buyers looking for them. Supply exceeds demand—and 
buyers benefit. Sellers may be more willing to drop prices, consider below-
asking-price offers, and make concessions like helping you pay closing 
costs.
These are all signs that you’re in a buyer’s market:
•	 Lots of active listings. There are more homes for sale on the market 
than there were in previous months or at this time in previous years.
•	 High inventory. There’s currently more than six months’ worth of in-
ventory on the market (see the box on page 248 to learn what this 
means). 
Always communicate with the seller through your agent. It’s her job to act as an 
intermediary between you and the seller.

Make an Offer
247
•	 Dropping prices. Median home prices are declining and active list 
prices are consistently lower than those of recent comps.
•	 Slow-moving listings. Houses remain on the market for six weeks or 
longer before they sell. You may notice the same listings week after 
week and For Sale signs that stay in place for a long time. As time pass-
es, you may notice that some For Sale signs add enticements like “Price 
Reduced” or “New Price.”
If you’re shopping during a buyer’s market, you’re in luck. The longer a 
house stays on the market, the more anxious the seller is to sell. And that 
may give you some leeway in crafting your offer. You may be able to buy 
the house at a discount or get seller’s concessions to help pay closing costs 
or put toward upgrades or repairs.
Use these tips to get the most out of a buyer’s market:
•	 Tour homes that have been on the market for six weeks or longer. 
When a seller first lists a home, there’s usually a flurry of interest. Even 
in a buyer’s market, the seller hopes to get the home’s asking price—
and is less willing to negotiate. As time passes, most sellers start to 
wonder what they can do to unload the home and are more willing to 
negotiate.
•	 Justify a low offer. Nobody likes to be seen as desperate, and the sell-
er may be insulted by a lowball offer. Do your homework, and attach 
information about comps to show they justify the price you’re sug-
gesting. The seller is more likely to listen.
•	 Request contingencies and concessions. A buyer’s market gives you 
the chance to attach conditions to your purchase. Think about what 
would make your purchase easier and smoother—such as extra help 
with closing costs—and then put your wish list into your purchase of-
fer. Even if the seller doesn’t agree to everything, you’ll have opened 
negotiations.
If sales continue to slow, inventory increases as homes come on the market at a 
faster rate than listings sell.
Page 236 suggests some ways a seller may help you pay closing costs.

Chapter 10
248
•	 Negotiate. If the seller comes back with a counteroffer, don’t throw up 
your hands and walk away. A counteroffer isn’t a rejection—it’s an in-
dication of the seller’s willingness to negotiate. The seller didn’t accept 
your offer but did leave the door ajar. Counter the counteroffer with a 
new one of your own—and realize that the back-and-forth could go 
on for a while before you reach an agreement.
A seller’s counteroffer may be the full listing price. The seller’s signal? It’s hard to 
say. He may be testing the waters to see whether you’ll pay the full price. Or he 
may be firm about the price but willing to negotiate elsewhere, like giving you a 
credit toward closing costs or making repairs or upgrades. The only way to find out 
what the seller is thinking is to ask. Make a counteroffer of your own, and see how 
the seller responds.
Frequently Asked Question
Determining Housing Inventory
My agent told me that it’s a good time to buy because there are eight months of 
inventory on the market. What does that mean, and how did she come up with this 
number?
Agents calculate a market’s housing inventory by figuring out how long it would 
take to sell all the houses listed within a specific price range at the rate homes are 
selling right now. This number, sometimes called the absorption rate, gives you an 
idea of how quickly or slowly homes are selling over time.
To figure out the absorption rate, pick the price range you’re interested in, and then 
look at the total number of active listings in that range last month. Next, get the 
number of listings sold (your agent calls these “closed listings”) during that month. 
Then get out your calculator and divide the total inventory by the number of closed 
listings. The result tells you how many months it would take to sell all listings if sales 
continued at last month’s rate.
Here’s an example: The total number of listings in your area last month was 2,459, 
with 302 closings. When you divide 2,459 by 302, the result is just over 8. So your 
agent would tell you that there’s eight months’ worth of inventory currently on the 
market. (And since you’re a buyer, that’s good news.)
When taking the market’s temperature, agents use these guidelines:
•	 Six months of inventory is a neutral market, favoring neither buyers nor sellers.
•	 More than six months of inventory (as in the example above) represents a buyer’s 
market; properties may languish for weeks or months before they sell.
•	 Less than six months of inventory is a seller’s market, and homes are selling 
quickly.

Make an Offer
249
•	 A strategy for rejected offers. Even if a seller rejects your offer out-
right and shows no inclination to bargain, keep an eye on the listing as 
you look at other homes. If the house is still on the market a month or 
two later, have your agent resubmit the offer. By then, the seller may 
be happy to reconsider.
How Much Should You Offer?
There’s no set formula for deciding how much money to offer for the home 
you want to buy. Too bad, because the issue is one of the knottiest ones 
you’ll encounter in your quest to buy a home. You don’t want to offer too 
much—nobody likes to overpay, and the bank’s appraiser may disagree 
that the home is worth what you offered, delaying or nixing the sale. You 
might even end up with negative equity if home values drop. But if your 
offer is too low, you may anger the seller or lose out to another buyer. 
Like all tough questions, this one doesn’t have an easy answer. You have 
to do your homework and weigh numerous factors to determine the price 
that you should offer for this home. If necessary, revisit your budget (page 
26) to make sure you don’t overspend. Then look at all the factors dis-
cussed in this section—comparable home prices, price trends, how much 
the seller owes her lender, how long the home has been on the market, 
and whether the market is hot or cold—and weigh them to come up with 
a price that’s fair for the property. And if that price is below the asking 
price, be prepared to negotiate (page 257).
What Goes Into an Offer
After you settle on a price—and maybe you and the seller have agreed 
verbally on that price—you’re ready to write up an offer to present to the 
seller. But you need to include more than just a price in your purchase of-
fer. You also want to include conditions, called contingencies, that you’re 
attaching to the offer, along with earnest money to show that you’re seri-
ous about buying the home. 
Page 257 lists tips for negotiating with a seller.
It’s your responsibility to determine how much a house is worth and whether you 
can afford it, so don’t ask your real estate agent how much you should pay. Instead, 
ask your agent about current market trends and whether the price you’re consider-
ing seems reasonable.

Purchase offers work differently in different parts of the country. In some 
states, your purchase offer is exactly that—an offer to purchase a home. 
In these states, you submit a purchase offer as a first step and then, if the 
seller accepts your offer, you write and sign a purchase-and-sale agree-
ment (often called just a purchase agreement) that spells out your and the 
seller’s conditions and expectations in greater detail. In other states, your 
purchase offer is the purchase-and-sale agreement, as long as the seller 
agrees to its terms, so you need to make sure it’s complete. This section 
discusses everything you might need in a purchase-and-sale agreement. 
(If some of the sections listed here would be overkill for a purchase offer in 
your area, your agent will let you know.)
Purchase Price
This is the heart and soul of any purchase offer: how much you offer to pay 
for the house. (But the rest of the offer is just as important, as you’ll soon 
see.) Remember that the offered purchase price is your opening gambit 
in the negotiating process. Few offers are accepted as made; instead, the 
seller is more likely to come back with a counteroffer. 
Earnest Money
Earnest money is a good-faith deposit you make along with your offer to 
show that you’re serious about buying the house. It’s the real estate version 
of putting your money where your mouth is. You write a check and give it 
to your agent as part of the offer. Usually, your agent holds the check until 
you and the seller agree on a price and terms, and then the agent deposits 
the earnest money in a trust account. At the closing (see Chapter 13), the 
earnest money goes toward your down payment on the home or toward 
your closing costs.
How much earnest money should you include? Enough to show the seller 
you’re serious but not more than you can afford to lose if a problem arises. 
Different areas have different customary amounts, but it’s usually in the 
range of 1 to 3 percent of the purchase price. In some areas, earnest mon-
ey may be a flat $1,000, and in transactions where the parties know each 
other, as in sales to family members, it may involve as little as $1.
Purchase offers and purchase-and-sale agreements are legally binding documents. 
In some states, a qualified attorney has to draw up these papers. If you don’t live 
in one of those states, it’s still a good idea to have a real estate attorney review 
your purchase offer (and also the purchase-and-sale agreement, if that’s a separate 
document) before you sign on the dotted line.

Make an Offer
251
If a deal falls through, you may get your earnest money back—or you may 
lose some or all of it. Laws vary from state to state. For example, some 
states allow a grace period during which you can change your mind about 
buying a house without forfeiting your earnest money. Beyond such laws, 
the fate of earnest money when a deal sours depends on what’s in your 
purchase agreement. Both you and the seller must agree on how the money 
gets disbursed if the sale falls through, so it’s important to write contin-
gencies in a way that there’s no penalty to you if, for example, the home 
fails to pass inspection.
Contingencies
A contingency is a condition that must be fulfilled for the purchase to 
move forward. Your purchase agreement isn’t binding until all the contin-
gencies it contains have been met. If a problem arises that prevents you or 
the seller from satisfying a contingency, you can cancel the contract and 
walk away from the deal. Contingencies protect you from losing your ear-
nest money if something goes wrong and you can’t go through with the 
sale. Here are common contingencies you might want to include in your 
purchase agreement (talk to your real estate agent or attorney if you have 
questions):
•	 Appraisal. Your lender requires an independent appraisal of the prop-
erty to make sure it’s worth what you offer. If the appraisal comes in 
below your purchase price, you can cancel the sale. But if you leave 
out this contingency, the seller might expect you to come up with the 
difference between the appraisal and the purchase price yourself.
•	 Financing. This contingency protects you in case your financing falls 
through. If the lender denies you a mortgage, you can cancel the pur-
chase agreement without penalty. Include a financing contingency 
even if your bank preapproves you for a mortgage. If you lose your job, 
for example, and no longer qualify for a loan, you don’t want to lose your 
earnest money as well. The more specific you can be in the financing 
contingency, the better. Spell out the maximum interest rate you’ll pay 
and the number of points you want to buy on the mortgage, the name 
of the lender, and a clear definition of what you mean by “diligent ef-
forts” to obtain a loan—for example, you should specify that you’re mak-
ing a diligent effort even if you apply for a loan with just one lender.
Don’t sign a purchase offer unless you understand how your earnest money will 
be held and under what circumstances it will be returned to you. This is one of the 
reasons that, even in states that don’t require a lawyer to draw up purchase agree-
ments, it’s a good idea to consult a lawyer anyway.

Chapter 10
252
•	 Home inspection. An essential contingency is the right to have the 
home thoroughly inspected by a professional home inspector of your 
choice. If the home inspection reveals problems that are unacceptable 
to you, like a cracked foundation or a leaky roof, you can cancel the 
contract (and get your earnest money back) or ask the seller to repair 
the problems or offer you a credit to pay for their repair. If the seller 
refuses, you can cancel the sale.
You may want to specify one or more specialized inspections, such as 
these, as part of the home inspection contingency: 
—
— Lead-based paint inspection. If the home you want was built be-
fore 1978, it may contain lead-based paint, which is a health haz-
ard if you inhale paint dust or a child or pet eats peeling paint. 
Federal law mandates that buyers have 10 days to inspect for lead-
based paint. Page 140 tells you more about federal lead-disclosure 
requirements. 
—
— Pest inspection. In certain parts of the country, wood-destroying 
pests such as termites can cause significant, unseen damage to 
a home. Specify who pays for the pest inspection and make sure 
it includes all the buildings on the property, including garages, 
sheds, and barns.
—
— Sewer inspection. You may need to have the property’s sewer 
lines and (if applicable) septic system checked by a plumber. 
—
— Well inspection. If the property draws its water from a well (as op-
posed to a municipal water system), add a contingency that says 
the well water must meet health standards for drinking water.
—
— Roof inspection. Because of safety and liability concerns, some 
home inspectors check the roof visually from the ground but won’t 
climb a ladder and walk around on it. You might want a contingen-
cy that states that, if the inspector sees something “iffy” about the 
roof that needs further checking, you can have a roofing company 
inspect the roof.
The financing contingency should say that you may end the purchase agreement 
if you fail to get a written commitment for a mortgage loan from the lender named 
in the agreement.

Make an Offer
253
—
— Radon, mold, or asbestos inspection. Your home inspector 
may recommend an additional inspection for one of these health 
hazards. For example, the inspector may spot some mold in the 
basement and recommend that you check the building for black 
mold—a toxin that can cause respiratory problems (and costs a 
lot to eradicate). This contingency should allow adequate time for 
these inspections.
•	 Seller’s disclosure. As you learned on page 139, most states require 
sellers to disclose all known problems and material facts about a 
house to prospective buyers. If you live in a state that doesn’t require 
disclosure (your agent can tell you if you do), make your purchase offer 
contingent on full disclosure. 
•	 Homeowners’ association documents. If the home you’re buying is 
governed by a homeowners’, condominium, or co-op association or 
board of directors, put in a contingency that lets you to review and ap-
prove of all association documents. 
•	 Title. The seller must provide free and clear title to the property (no 
outstanding liens or claims), and your lender will require a title search 
to ensure this. Most purchase offers include a contingency that lets 
you cancel the contract without penalty if the seller can’t deliver a 
clear title—make sure yours does.
•	 Final walkthrough. To avoid unpleasant surprises on moving day, make 
sure you have the opportunity to tour the home shortly before the clos-
ing. Page 287 tells you what to look for on the final walkthrough.
•	 Sale of your current home. If you already own a home, coordinating 
the sale of your existing home with the purchase of a new one can be 
challenging. If you find the home you want to buy while your current 
home is still on the market, this contingency protects both you and 
the seller. It gives you a specified number of days to sell your existing 
home before closing on this one. If you don’t sell your home within 
that time frame, you or the seller can cancel the purchase agreement. 
This protects you from having to pay two mortgages at once, and it 
protects the seller from keeping the home off the market indefinitely, 
waiting for a sale that may not happen.

Chapter 10
254
•	 Final inspection of new construction. If you’re buying a brand-new 
home, you may think you don’t need a home inspection contingency. 
Think again. Many homebuyers have moved into a newly built home 
to encounter major problems with shoddy workmanship and poor 
materials. Include a contingency that gives you the right to conduct 
an independent home inspection after the builder has finished con-
struction. If there are problems, the builder can correct them before 
you move in.
•	 Attorney approval. This contingency gives you five or 10 days to 
have an attorney look over and approve the purchase agreement. It’s a 
good idea if someone other than an attorney wrote the contract. If the 
attorney finds problems, you can renegotiate the affected sections. 
The seller may also want to include some contingencies in the purchase 
agreement for the same reason you do—to protect himself if a problem 
arises. Here are some common seller contingencies:
•	 Replacement home. If the seller hasn’t yet found a new home to move 
to, you may see a contingency that reads something like this: “This 
transaction is contingent on the seller finding a replacement home.” 
Although it’s understandable that the seller wants to coordinate sell-
ing his home with buying a new one, that one short sentence gives the 
seller the right to cancel the sale without penalty at any time—a big 
problem for you if you’ve invested time and money in the deal. If the 
seller insists on a replacement home contingency, be sure to give it an 
expiration date, such as 30 days. If the seller hasn’t found a new home 
within that period, he must either release the contingency (letting the 
sale go ahead) or cancel the contract. 
•	 Time limits. The seller doesn’t want to wait around if you drag your 
feet applying for a mortgage or getting a home inspection. While 
you’re checking such things off your to-do list, his home is off the 
market—and he may be missing out on other buyers if the deal falls 
through. So expect the seller to attach time limits to your contingen-
cies. For example, the seller might give you a week to apply for a loan 
or two weeks to complete a home inspection.
•	 Attorney approval. Like you, the seller may want to get an attorney’s 
stamp of approval on the language of the contract.
•	 More earnest money. Occasionally, a seller wants to raise your stakes 
by asking for an increase in your earnest money deposit before the 
closing, perhaps two weeks after you sign the purchase agreement, 
for example. From the seller’s point of view, this kind of contingency, 
which is most common during a seller’s market, shows the seller you’re 
serious about the deal.

255
Contingencies, like everything else in your purchase agreement, are ne-
gotiable. You don’t have to agree to a particular contingency, and neither 
does the seller. Some, like the financing, appraisal, and home inspection 
contingencies, are standard (so the seller would be foolish to try to reject 
them). Expect to spend some time going back and forth on contingencies. 
It can take a few rounds of negotiations to craft a purchase agreement that 
both you and the seller can live with.
What’s Staying
If something is not nailed down (or sometimes even if it is), don’t assume it 
comes with the home. This includes appliances, window treatments, light 
fixtures, and so on. These items are considered personal property, not part 
of the house, so you and the seller need to agree about which items stay 
with the home (called conveyances) and which move out with the seller. 
Unless your purchase agreement spells out that the refrigerator, washer 
and dryer, dishwasher, and so on stay with the home, the seller has no ob-
ligation to leave them for you. 
Who Pays Which Costs
The divvying up of closing costs varies by area, and your agent will work 
with you to explain which costs are customary for you to pay and which 
the seller usually picks up. This section of the purchase agreement is where 
you ask for a seller concession (page 236) to help with closing costs or for 
the seller to pay for closing costs that are usually the buyer’s responsibility.
Access
Between signing the purchase agreement and closing, you need get into 
the home several times: to inspect the building, measure rooms and win-
dows, try out paint samples or fabric swatches, walk through one last time, 
and so on. You’d be surprised at how often buyers find it difficult to gain 
access to a home they’re in the process of buying. Add a clause to your 
purchase agreement that gives you the right to reasonable access at rea-
sonable times with a certain amount of advance notice, such as 72 hours. 
The key word here is “reasonable.” Until you close on the property, it’s still 
the seller’s home, so don’t go overboard with demands to get in and take 
yet another look around.
Closing Date
Several weeks—or several months—may pass before you’re ready to close 
on the property. Your purchase agreement gives an outside date for the clos-
ing. Your agent can help you choose a realistic one. Thirty days is typical.

Chapter 10
256
Possession
In most sales, the buyer takes possession of the home immediately after 
closing. Sometimes, though, you or the seller need to make special ar-
rangements. You may need to move into the home before the sale because 
you’ve already sold your old home, for example, or the seller may need to 
remain there for a while afterward. If that’s the case, include a rental clause 
that spells out the rent you or the seller will pay and the length of the 
rental agreement.
Acceptance
Your purchase offer comes with a time limit, usually 24 to 48 hours. If the 
seller fails to respond within that time, your offer expires. Although there 
may be situations when you want to give the seller more time (perhaps the 
seller is out of town and the listing agent needs more time to get in touch), 
24 hours is usually plenty of time for a seller to accept or reject your offer 
or respond with a counteroffer. You don’t want to spend several days tied 
to an offer that a seller might reject when you could be looking at other 
homes.
Negotiating: The Art of the Deal
After receiving your offer, the seller has three options:
•	 Accept it. If the seller is satisfied with the purchase price and condi-
tions of your offer, you’ve got a deal. Your offer becomes the basis for a 
purchase-and-sale agreement between you and the seller, setting the 
wheels in motion for you to buy the house. 
•	 Make a counteroffer. More likely, the seller will make a counteroffer. 
In a counteroffer, the seller changes anything in your offer she dislikes 
or doesn’t agree to, including the purchase price, contingencies, con-
cessions you’ve asked for, conveyances, or the closing date—every-
thing is fair game. But a counteroffer also signals that the seller is open 
to negotiating (and now the ball’s back in your court). 
If you’re making an offer on a bank-owned home (an REO, explained on page 127), 
the bank may require up to four days to respond to your offer.

Make an Offer
257
•	 Reject it. Sometimes, a seller will flat-out say no. This often happens 
when the seller feels your offer is unrealistically low. A rejection indi-
cates that the seller doesn’t want to negotiate (but see page 249 about 
responding to a rejection in a buyer’s market).
It’s rare for a seller to accept a buyer’s initial offer, so be prepared for coun-
teroffers, refusals, demands, and compromises. When you get a counter-
offer, it’s your turn to look over the suggested price and conditions and 
decide whether to accept them, reject them, or counter with adjustments 
of your own. It’s very common to go back and forth for several rounds, 
crossing out numbers and clauses and writing in new ones before you and 
the seller reach an agreement.
Negotiations can be stressful and frustrating, each side thinking that the 
other is being unreasonable and pig-headed. To make negotiations go 
smoothly, stay calm and professional. These tips help:
•	 Know the kind of market you’re in. Different market temperatures 
call for different strategies. If you’re in a hot seller’s market, you won’t 
have a lot of wiggle room for concessions and contingencies. But if the 
market is a cooler buyer’s market, the seller’s eagerness to close may 
work to your advantage. Page 243 tells you how to gauge whether 
you’re in a buyer’s or a seller’s market. 
•	 Put a human face on the negotiations. In most transactions, the 
buyer’s and the seller’s agents handle negotiations for you: Your agent 
presents your offer to the seller’s agent, who gives it to the seller. The 
seller and her agent confer, and then the seller’s agent presents the 
counteroffer to your agent, who discusses it with you. And on it goes. 
Usually, that’s how you want things to work, leaving negotiations to 
the professionals. In some situations, though, being one step removed 
from the negotiations may feel too impersonal—the parties trying to 
agree can see each other as obstacles, not people. If you’re comfort-
able with the idea (and your agent agrees it would help negotiations), 
Although you and the seller have plenty to say to each other during negotiations, 
you probably won’t sit down and discuss matters face to face. Negotiations almost 
always take place through your agents—and that’s as it should be. Your agent is 
an expert negotiator who can explain terms and offer advice, so you have time to 
mull things over before you respond.

Chapter 10
258
meet the seller face to face, sitting down with your respective agents 
and talking about the purchase. Or write a friendly letter, explaining 
how much you love the house and the reasoning behind your offer, 
and ask your agent to deliver it to the seller. You and the seller will see 
each other as living, breathing human beings, and you may be able to 
finalize your agreement faster.
•	 Understand where the seller is coming from. The seller has goals 
and pressures related to the sale. If you know what these are, you’re in 
a better position to negotiate. For example, a seller who’s in a hurry to 
close might be willing to compromise on price or conveyances if this 
speeds up the sale. Ask your agent if she knows anything about the 
seller’s situation that might aid you in negotiations.
•	 Play your cards close to your chest. Knowledge is power, so don’t 
give too much away. For example, if you’ve been preapproved for a 
loan that’s higher than your offer, you don’t want the seller to know 
that; she might hold out for a higher price. Don’t give away any infor-
mation that the seller can use to her advantage.
•	 Know your priorities. Identify your must-haves and your deal-breakers. 
When you know what’s important to you, it’s easier to compromise on 
issues that aren’t so high on your priority list.
•	 Ask for something you could live without. You might add a few 
terms to your initial purchase offer with the intention of using them 
as bargaining chips. For example, you might request the washer and 
dryer as conveyances or ask for more money than you’re willing to 
accept toward repairs. If the seller balks, you can agree to drop that 
request—and insist on something you really want in its place.
•	 Don’t get too emotionally involved. If you care too much about buy-
ing this particular house, you put yourself at a disadvantage in nego-
tiations. Seasoned negotiators say the one who wins is the one who 
has the least to lose, the one who’s ready to walk away from the table. 
So keep a cool head. Ask yourself, “What’s the worst that would hap-
pen if this purchase falls through?” And keep looking at other houses 
as you negotiate, as a reminder that you have other options. That way, 
if things don’t work out, you can move forward more easily.
•	 Don’t get too competitive. The goal of negotiation is to arrive at an 
agreement that’s satisfactory to both parties. Don’t develop the mind-
set that you’re out to “beat” the seller, or you might find that the seller 
stops negotiating. You’re aiming for a win-win situation, not one where 
you win and the seller loses.

Frequently Asked Question
If Buyer’s Remorse Strikes
I put in an offer on a home, and the seller accepted. At first I was ecstatic, but now I’m 
scared. How do I deal with buyer’s remorse?
Buyer’s remorse may pounce at any time as you go through the process of buying a 
house—even after you move in. It’s the uneasy feeling, which might keep you up at 
night, that you’ve made a big mistake. You’re not alone. Buyer’s remorse is common 
among first-time homebuyers who worry about the amount of debt they’re taking 
on, the lifestyle changes that come with owning a home, and even whether they 
might have found something better if they’d kept looking. If you feel that way, don’t 
panic. You can work through buyer’s remorse and go on to enjoy your new home.
The best way to deal with buyer’s remorse is to avoid it in the first place. Do your 
homework at all stages of the home-buying process. That’s why you bought this 
book, after all. If you set your budget (page 26), figured out how much home you 
can afford (page 31), come up with the down payment (page 146) and closing costs 
(page 234) you need, determined your housing needs (page 52), researched neigh-
borhoods (page 72), and found a good agent to guide you (page 90), you did ev-
erything you could to find the right home. Remind yourself that you’ve done this 
groundwork and you’re not rushing into the purchase blindly. 
You can also duck buyer’s remorse by avoiding situations that encourage second-
guessing. For example, friends and family may be excited for you—but they’re 
probably also full of words of “wisdom,” criticism, and horror stories you don’t need 
to hear. Whether you’re hearing well-meaning advice or a flood of negativity, re-
member that these people aren’t you, and their situation isn’t yours. 
Similarly, once you have a purchase agreement in hand, stop looking at other 
homes. Agreeing to buy one home can make every new home that comes on the 
market look like the best deal ever. Don’t subject yourself to that. You had good rea-
sons for deciding on this home. Focus on those—and stop checking new listings.
And if you really can’t go through with the sale, the first thing to do is check your 
purchase agreement. There may be a cancellation clause that allows you to opt out 
of the deal without penalty if you cancel within a certain time frame. If you put 
together a good purchase offer (page 249), you have contingencies that give you 
an out under certain circumstances—from failing to get funding to an unsatisfac-
tory home inspection to problems with the title—so you don’t have to worry about 
being stuck with a lemon. Finally, if you’re willing to say goodbye to your earnest 
money, you can always just walk away (be aware, though, that the seller may sue for 
damages and the agents may sue for their commissions if you do this). 
But it doesn’t have to come to that. Know that many, many buyers feel twinges of 
doubt on their way to becoming satisfied homeowners. If you’re aware that buyer’s 
remorse might hit you, you’ll be able to work through it quickly and get on with the 
purchase of your home.

C
ongratulations—you’ve got a deal! Once the ink has dried on your 
new purchase-and-sale agreement and the fizz has left the cele-
bratory champagne, you’re probably left wondering, “Now what?” 
You’ve got a contract to buy a home, but the real work is just beginning. 
Now is the time to acquire financing (Chapter 8), arrange for a home in-
spection (Chapter 12), and work your way through a to-do list of other 
tasks to get ready for the closing—the official act of transferring owner-
ship from the seller to you. Depending on the contingencies in your pur-
chase agreement and when you want to close, you may have to move fast.
This chapter explains how to clear the way for the closing by removing 
those contingencies, initiating a title search, buying insurance and per-
haps a home warranty, getting ready to move, and walking through the 
house to inspect it one last time.

Chapter 11
262
Check Off Contingencies
Your purchase agreement contains a number of contingencies (page 
251)—conditions that you or the seller must meet before the sale can hap-
pen. Some contingencies, such as the financing and home inspection con-
tingencies, protect you if a serious problem arises that prevents you from 
buying the house. Others protect the seller, like a contingency that limits 
how much the seller will pay for repairs.
When you’re satisfied that a contingency has been met, you remove that 
contingency from the purchase agreement. For example, when your lender 
sends you a commitment letter approving your loan, it’s time to remove 
the financing contingency (see below). The seller also removes his con-
tingencies as they’re met. Although you can remove a contingency with 
a phone call to your real estate agent or lawyer, it’s a good idea to do it in 
writing. That way, if problems arise later, you can prove when the contin-
gency was met. Any contingencies either you or the seller doesn’t release 
can become grounds for canceling the contract. For example, if your home 
inspection reveals problems with the home’s structure, you can open a 
new round of negotiations with the seller to deal with those problems—or 
you can walk away from the sale because the house didn’t meet the home 
inspection contingency.
Removing the Financing Contingency
You probably included a financing contingency in your purchase agree-
ment to protect yourself in case you can’t get a mortgage—if the lender 
denies your loan application, you can get your earnest money deposit 
back and cancel the purchase. When your lender sends you a commitment 
letter—its official approval of your loan—you’ve cleared that hurdle, and 
you can remove the financing contingency from the agreement. 
The seller may agree to the financing contingency only if it includes a time 
limit—usually between two and six weeks—which protects the seller from 
taking the home off the market indefinitely if you have trouble getting a 
loan. If you don’t get a commitment letter during that time, the seller has 
two options: extend the time limit or cancel the sale. 
Don’t remove your financing contingency on the basis of a phone call from your 
loan originator. Wait until you have the commitment letter in hand. Until you’ve 
got a commitment in writing, something could still go wrong with your mortgage 
application.

Prepare for the Closing 
263
Removing the Appraisal Contingency
Your purchase agreement may include a contingency that says the lender’s 
appraiser must find the home worth at least what you offered for it. In 
some states, you have a limited time to get the appraisal done—in Califor-
nia, for example, the standard is 17 days from the time you sign the pur-
chase agreement. If all goes smoothly, the appraisal satisfies the bank, and 
you remove the appraisal contingency from your purchase agreement. If 
you and your agent have done your homework when you figured out the 
house’s worth, you shouldn’t have any problem with the appraisal.
Sometimes, though, an appraiser determines that a house is worth less 
than what you offered. A seller could overprice her house, for example, or 
multiple bidders could drive the price unrealistically high. Fast-dropping 
home prices or a flood of preforeclosures and foreclosures in the neigh-
borhood can also affect a house’s value—if most of the recent comparable 
sales are short sales, for example, your appraisal is likely to come in low.
If the house appraises for less than your offer, you have four options:
•	 Get a second appraisal. Sometimes the lender’s appraiser covers a 
large geographic region and may be unfamiliar with the area where 
you’re buying. If that happens, get an appraisal from a local firm and 
ask the lender to review the new appraisal.
•	 Negotiate for a lower price. The seller may be willing to accept a price 
that’s more in line with the bank’s appraisal rather than lose the sale.
•	 Pay the difference out of pocket. If you really want the house and 
the seller won’t budge on the price, pay the difference between the 
appraised value and what you offered. Your lender analyzes the home’s 
loan-to-value ratio (page 39) because it doesn’t want to lose money 
on your mortgage. If you put down more cash, thereby lowering the 
amount you need to borrow, the lender may move forward with the 
loan. 
Get preapproved for a loan (page 34) before you go house-hunting. Preapproval 
speeds up the final approval process, so you’ll worry less about getting your com-
mitment letter within the timeframe the financing contingency allows.
If you decide to get a second appraisal, ask the seller to pay for it. The seller has 
taken the house off the market and invested significant time in selling you the 
home. If a second appraisal could salvage the sale, he might make the investment.

Chapter 11
264
•	 Cancel the sale. The whole reason you put an appraisal contingency 
in the purchase agreement was to give yourself an emergency exit if 
there was a problem. You can take that exit if a low appraisal sours you 
on the house.
Removing the Home Inspection Contingency
You never know what problems lurk just out of sight when you walk 
through your future home for the first time. That’s why a home inspection 
contingency is essential to every purchase agreement (it’s so important 
that Chapter 12 is dedicated to showing you what a home inspector looks 
for). Schedule an inspection as soon as you sign your purchase agreement 
so you have plenty of time to go over the inspector’s report.
Don’t expect a “perfect” report. No home stays in newly built condition for-
ever—and even new construction can have problems with workmanship 
or materials. It’s up to you to decide which problems you can live with and 
which you want repaired as a condition of sale—or whether the problems 
are so severe that you no longer want to buy the home.
Once you get the home inspection report (page 302), sit down and write 
up a list of repairs the house needs. Use this list as you review problems 
with the seller. You need to address important problems, but try not to go 
overboard. If you push too hard on minor issues, the seller might tell you 
to forget the whole thing. And if the seller has included a contingency that 
limits the amount he’ll spend on repairs, you may have to prioritize your 
wish list of repairs.
When you talk with the seller, you want him to answer two questions: How 
will he address the problems (Fix them himself? Bring in a contractor?) and 
who picks up the tab? If the seller refuses to make all the repairs you want, 
you need to ask one more question: What do I do now?
How will the problems get fixed?
Some sellers might try to make the repairs themselves; lots of weekend 
handymen have a higher opinion of their do-it-yourself skills than they de-
serve. It’s in your interest to make sure that you get high-quality workman-
ship that permanently fixes the problem. The bottom line: Insist that the 
seller use a professional to make repairs.
Some states give the seller a chance to repair problems within a certain period of 
time before you can cancel a deal. Ask your real estate agent about your state’s 
requirements.

Prepare for the Closing 
265
The seller may want to choose who does the agreed-upon work. Unless 
you can vet the person’s work, don’t agree. After closing, it will be your 
home, not the seller’s. Remember, at this point, the seller wants to make 
repairs as quickly and as cheaply as possible. But you want repairs to be 
well done and long lasting.
Who picks up the tab?
It seems only fair that the seller pay for any and all repairs, right? After all, 
these problems cropped up while he lived there.
To an extent, that’s true. But a lot depends on the context of the sale, and 
you have to use your intuition when you negotiate repairs. A seller who’s 
lowered his purchase price or is selling in a hot market may decide that the 
hassle and cost of extensive repairs aren’t worth it and try to find a less de-
manding buyer. On the other hand, if you know the seller’s eager to close 
the deal, you’ve got some bargaining power. 
When you and the seller agree on which repairs are his responsibility, he 
can pay for them in one of three ways. He can:
•	 Arrange and pay for repairs before the closing. If you take this route, 
make sure the seller lets you approve the contractor before work be-
gins. Then make sure the contractor shows up and keep track of his 
progress (if he doesn’t finish the repairs in a timely manner, you might 
have to push back the closing). Double-check the work on your final 
walkthrough (see page 286). 
•	 Reduce the purchase price. This option can save you money on inter-
est (because you borrow less money), property taxes, points, and other 
closing costs calculated as a percentage of the purchase price. But, of 
course, you have to come up with the cash to make repairs yourself.
Get estimates and have them in hand when you negotiate repairs with the seller. 
It’s easier to discuss repairs when you know what they cost.
Check out the negotiating tips for making an offer on page 256. They apply to this 
kind of negotiation as well.

Chapter 11
266
•	 Give you a credit at closing. Instead of receiving all proceeds of the 
sale that remain after he pays off his mortgage and other costs, the 
seller returns an agreed-upon amount to you. You can get the money 
in cash, or the seller may put it into a special account designated for 
repairs (your lender might insist on that second option to make sure 
the repairs get done).
What if the seller insists on selling “as is”?
You may find a seller who’s uninterested in making or paying for repairs, 
essentially telling you to “take it or leave it.” If that happens, you may de-
cide to remove the home inspection contingency from your purchase 
agreement and buy the home as is. Before you do that, though, make sure 
you have a good idea of how much the repairs will cost and whether you 
can afford them. Or you can cancel the purchase agreement (thanks to 
the home inspection contingency), abandon the deal—and get back to 
house-hunting.
Removing Other Contingencies
You remove any other contingencies—like the preliminary title report and 
the final walkthrough—in the same way you remove the contingencies 
described above. When the seller meets a condition, say so in writing, and 
the transaction takes another step forward. 
What if you find that you can’t remove a contingency? For example, say 
your bank offers an interest rate that’s higher than your financing contin-
gency allows? Or you can’t meet the appraisal contingency because the 
appraisal came in lower than expected?
In this situation, you’ve got three choices:
•	 Negotiate with the seller. You may be able to extend a contingency’s 
time limit or revise the purchase price. Many sellers prefer renegotiat-
ing to losing the sale.
Many contingencies have a time limit, such as 7 days to apply for financing or 17 
days to complete a home inspection. Keep a close eye on contingencies’ expiration 
dates; if the date slips past and you haven’t acted, you may no longer be able to 
enforce that contingency.

Prepare for the Closing 
267
•	 Waive the contingency. You can remove any contingency you put in 
the contract, even if the conditions it describes haven’t been met. You 
do this with a written, signed release stating you waive the contingency. 
Think long and hard before you do so. You put it into the purchase 
agreement to protect yourself in the transaction, and you should be 
reasonably sure that dropping the contingency won’t cause problems 
for you down the road.
•	 Cancel the sale. You wrote contingencies into your purchase agree-
ment so you’d have an out if the sale doesn’t proceed as you expect. If 
a failed contingency makes the sale impossible for you—if you don’t 
obtain financing, for example—you can cancel the sale. If that hap-
pens, you and the seller should sign a document that releases both 
of you from the purchase agreement. After that, you should get back 
your earnest money.
All About Titles and Deeds
At the closing, money changes hands, and then the seller transfers owner-
ship of the property to you. That transfer involves two elements:
•	 Title is a legal concept of ownership. When you hold title to a property, 
it means you own that property. As page 270 explains, there are sev-
eral different ways you can hold title.
•	 The deed is a written document that records the title. It says in black 
and white who owns the property. The final step in the sale of a house 
is when your escrow officer or attorney records the deed with your lo-
cal property office.
To prepare for this transfer of ownership, you need to do two things:
•	 Make sure that the seller is really the property’s owner and has a legal 
right to sell you the property.
•	 Decide what you want the deed to say about your ownership of the 
property—that is, how you’ll hold title.
This section explains what you need to know about titles and deeds to get 
ready for the closing. 
The seller has to agree that the contingency can’t be met and the sale is over for 
you to get your earnest money back. If the seller feels you’re canceling the sale 
frivolously, he can try to get some or all of your earnest money—or even sue for 
damages or to try to make you go through with the sale.

Chapter 11
268
Getting Clear Title
For your new home to truly be yours, the seller needs to give you a “clear” 
title; that means that no one has any claims on the property that could in-
terfere with the seller’s ability to sell it—or with your ability to own it. Soon 
after you sign the purchase agreement, your attorney or escrow agent 
starts the process of making sure that the seller has clear title by conduct-
ing a title search. This is the first step in getting title insurance, which of-
fers protection if someone makes a legal claim against the title—perhaps 
a long-lost relative of a former owner or a contractor who never got paid 
for work done on the property. Your lender requires that you buy title in-
surance to protect the lender’s interest in the home; you can also buy title 
insurance for yourself.  
The title search
Before a title company issues you a title insurance policy, it does a title 
search, tracing the property’s ownership and checking for claims against 
it. (Some states require that an attorney, rather than an insurance com-
pany, conduct the title search.) When someone researches a title, they look 
through decades’ worth of legal records—deeds, tax records, divorce de-
crees, court judgments, wills, bankruptcy filings, and so on—with three 
main goals:
•	 To establish that the seller has the right to sell the property. Events 
like a divorce or a death in the family can affect who owns a home. It’s 
also not unheard of for a distant relative of a past owner to lay claim to 
a property. The title search tries to prevent such surprises.
•	 To discover any liens that must be paid off at the closing. A lien is a 
legal claim made against a property, usually by someone to whom the 
seller owes money. Examples include second mortgages (where the 
bank places a lien against the property as collateral), tax liens (where 
the owner owes back taxes), mechanic’s liens (for money owed to con-
tractors or vendors), and liens for back alimony or child support. A lien 
may be consensual (the property owner agreed to it) or nonconsen-
sual (a legal judgment against the property owner attached the lien 
to the property). If a property has liens against it, the money owed will 
most likely come out of the seller’s proceeds at closing. But unknown 
liens can threaten the sale.
Many states regulate how much title companies can charge for title searches and 
title insurance. If your state doesn’t, shop around to get the best deal for your 
money.

Prepare for the Closing 
269
•	 To identify restrictions and easements associated with the prop-
erty. An easement gives someone other than the owner the right to 
use the property for a specific purpose. For example, most properties 
have utility easements for electric and telephone lines so utility com-
panies can plant telephone poles and string electric and phone wires 
across a front yard. Or there might be a view easement, which prevents 
the property owner from blocking a neighbor’s view, or an easement 
that lets a neighbor use the property’s driveway to access her property.
If the title search turns up a problem in any of these areas, the title has 
what’s called a defect (or sometimes a cloud). About a third of all title 
searches uncover some kind of defect. Often, these are small oversights 
that are easily put right: a missing signature on a document or a paid-off 
lien whose holder forgot to file a release. The title insurance company or 
attorney conducting the title search prepares a preliminary report that 
lists any defects so you can get them corrected before closing. You get the 
final title search report at closing.
Title insurance
Title defects can turn up even after a successful title search. That’s what 
title insurance is for—it protects the policyholder from losing money if an 
unforeseen title defect crops up. As part of your mortgage agreement, you 
have to buy your lender title insurance to cover their investment, and you 
have the option to buy an owner’s policy as well. For either kind of policy, 
title insurance covers any costs you or your bank incur defending against a 
title challenge. In addition, here’s what each covers:
•	 Lender’s policy. If a defect turns up that voids your title to the proper-
ty, lender’s title insurance pays off your mortgage. Because it protects 
the lender’s investment, the amount of protection the policy offers 
decreases as you make payments toward your mortgage, and it ends 
when you pay off the mortgage.
•	 Owner’s policy. If you purchase an owner’s title insurance policy 
(they’re optional), it protects you if a defect results in the loss of your 
title to the home. Typically, this policy covers a property’s full value, 
and it remains in effect for as long as you (or your heirs) own the prop-
erty. Most policies protect against loss or damage from forgery, mis-
representations of identity, and liens in the public record that come to 
light after you’ve bought the home. If you have any questions about 
the policy, ask a real estate attorney. 
If a search finds serious defects on the title, you have grounds to back out of the 
sale.

Chapter 11
270
Putting Your Name on the Deed
A deed is a legal document that, when recorded with your local govern-
ment, formally establishes legal ownership of a piece of property. The 
deed is the instrument that transfers title from one owner to another, from 
the seller to you. Although recording the deed is the very last thing that 
happens in a sale, your attorney or closing agent needs to prepare the doc-
ument ahead of time. For that to happen, you need to decide on the form 
of ownership you want, because it’s recorded on the deed.
There are several ways you can hold title to a property. Each has different 
legal and tax ramifications, so discuss the options with your attorney and 
accountant.
Sole property
If you’re a single person buying a home by yourself, you’ll hold the title as 
your sole property. Sole property means that the house belongs to you 
and you alone—no one else has any interest in the title. If you’re married 
or in a domestic partnership, you can still own the house as sole prop-
erty. You might do this if your spouse has poor credit and wouldn’t qualify 
for a mortgage, for example. In such a case, you need to talk to an attor-
ney about whether sole property is the right decision for you and how to 
make sure that you retain sole ownership despite your marital status. Your 
spouse may have to sign a quitclaim deed to relinquish any claim to the 
property.
Sole property means sole responsibility. If you live alone, that makes 
sense. If you’re married and you’re the sole owner, you’re responsible for 
all house-related expenses: PITI, maintenance, repairs, and so on. If your 
spouse contributes to these expenses, he or she may be able to claim an 
interest in the home’s title later on.
Title insurance costs vary widely according to area (some states regulate title insur-
ance pricing) and the home’s purchase price. You pay for a title insurance policy 
just once, at the closing. There aren’t any continuing monthly premiums.
If your circumstances change, you can change the kind of title you hold. For ex-
ample, you can start off with joint tenancy and later set up a trust and transfer title 
to it. If you want to change the way you hold title, consult an attorney who can 
draw up the paperwork for you.

Prepare for the Closing 
271
Joint tenants with right of survivorship
Joint tenancy titles mean that each person listed on the deed owns an 
equal share of the property—if you buy a home with your spouse, for ex-
ample, you each own 50 percent of the property.
If one of you dies, the full title automatically transfers to the other; because 
you have a joint tenancy with right of survivorship, you don’t need to go 
to probate court (the kind of court that deals with wills and estates) to 
establish ownership. 
You have to meet four standards (called “unities” in Realtor-speak) for joint 
tenancy:
•	 Time. Each of the joint owners must receive the title at the same time.
•	 Title. Each owner must receive title via the same instrument (the same 
deed).
•	 Interest. Each owner holds an equal share in a property.
•	 Possession. Each owner has an equal right to occupy the property.
With joint tenancy, both parties have equal benefits and responsibilities 
with regard to the property. For example, you can’t rent out a guest house 
and keep the money for yourself; your spouse is equally entitled to it. And 
your spouse can’t take out a loan using the house as collateral and then 
divorce you, leaving you to pay the debt; your ex-spouse is equally respon-
sible for the loan.
Tenancy in common
Unlike joint tenancy, tenancy in common requires only one unity: posses-
sion. Under this arrangement, co-owners have an equal right to occupy 
the property, but you may own the property in unequal shares. For ex-
ample, if you buy a house with someone and you put up 80 percent of the 
down payment and the other person contributes only 20 percent, tenancy 
in common allows you to own an 80 percent share in the home. Those 
shares apply to the entire house, not to certain rooms or areas. If you want, 
you can sell your share of the property without the other’s consent (this 
works both ways, of course), unless you have a written agreement that 
says otherwise.
If you want to split ownership into unequal shares, you must specify how you want 
those shares divided in the deed. Otherwise, the assumption is that ownership is 
50/50.

Chapter 11
272
Tenancy in common doesn’t include the right of survivorship. Unless you 
specify in your will that you want your co-owner to inherit your share of the 
property if you die, your interest in the property gets divided up among 
your heirs.
Tenancy by the entirety
In tenancy by the entirety, the law treats the property’s co-owners as 
though they were a single person. From a legal perspective, you and your 
spouse each own 100 percent of the property (not just 50 percent), and 
each of you has the legal right to sell the home but only with the other’s 
consent. Tenancy by the entirety protects your home from creditors. If, for 
example, your spouse is in default on a credit card balance, the creditor 
can’t come after your spouse’s share of the home, because you each own 
the whole house. Each spouse also has the right of survivorship, so if one 
of you dies, the other automatically gets sole interest in the house without 
going through probate court.
Not all states recognize tenancy by the entirety (check with your real es-
tate attorney), and only married couples (or, in some states, like Hawaii and 
Vermont, registered domestic partners) qualify.
Community property 
Community property is another kind of title that’s not available every-
where. And in the states that allow it, only married couples (or, in some 
cases, registered domestic partners) can own real estate as community 
property. If you and your spouse own your home as community property, 
each of you owns half the property. You and your spouse can will your half 
to anyone you please. While you’re both alive, though, neither of you can 
sell or transfer your interest in the property to anyone else without the 
other’s consent.
Currently, community property states include Alaska, Arizona, California, 
Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. 
A few of these (Alaska, Arizona, California, Nevada, and Wisconsin) also al-
low community property with right of survivorship. In those states, if one 
owner dies, the other automatically inherits the property without going 
through probate—neither of you can leave your share of the property to 
a different heir. 
If a co-owner in a joint tenancy sells his or her part of the property, joint tenancy is 
broken and the title becomes tenancy in common.

273
Living trust
A trust is a legal structure where a trustee holds property for someone else 
(called the beneficiary). You can set up a living trust to own your home. 
You’re the trustee, and you control the trust for as long as you live (or until 
you sell the property). If you die, the trust quickly distributes your home 
and any other parts of your estate to your beneficiaries. There’s no need 
to go to probate court. Unlike a will, which becomes public information 
after you die, the details of the trust remain private. A living trust can also 
significantly reduce estate taxes.
Living trusts are revocable, so if your circumstances change, you can 
change the terms of the trust. You need a real estate or estate planning 
attorney to help you set up a living trust and transfer title to it.
Survey the Property
Your lender may require you to get a survey of the property to determine 
its boundaries and check for encroachments—structures, such as build-
ings or fences, that cross the property line. Either you or your neighbor 
can be the one who’s encroaching on the other’s property. You may be 
able to deal with an encroachment by getting an easement in which the 
encroached-upon party grants permission for the encroachment. In some 
cases, however, you might have to tear down the encroaching structure.
Homeowner’s Insurance
It would be nice if someone could guarantee that disaster will never strike 
your new house, but that kind of guarantee doesn’t exist. Insurance of-
fers the next-best thing when it comes to peace of mind. Homeowner’s 
insurance protects your investment in your home, so if your home is dam-
aged or destroyed, you’re covered. Your lender will require that you buy 
a homeowner’s insurance policy, and you’ll need to show evidence of the 
policy at the closing.
Ask whether the seller had his property surveyed in the past. You may be able to 
save some money by having this survey updated or (if your lender will accept it) 
submitting it with an affidavit from the seller saying he hasn’t made any changes 
to the property since the survey.

Chapter 11
274
Homeowner’s insurance has two main components:
•	 Hazard insurance, which covers physical damage to your property, 
such as from fire or wind. It also covers your possessions if, for exam-
ple, they’re stolen or damaged in a fire.
•	 Liability insurance, which protects you if someone is injured on your 
property by anything from slipping on icy steps to being injured by a 
pet or family member. 
The sections below detail both parts of your homeowner’s insurance policy.
Hazard Insurance
The homeowner’s policy you buy must meet your lender’s basic require-
ments for hazard insurance. What the lender wants, of course, is to protect 
its investment in your mortgage. Your home is the loan’s collateral, and if 
some catastrophe destroys that collateral, your lender is out the money. 
To you, however, your home is more than just an investment, and hazard 
insurance protects you, too. It’s in your interest to buy a policy that’s afford-
able and offers the coverage you need if the unthinkable happens. 
Hazard insurance covers both the structure and contents (your personal 
property) of a home. If a grease fire breaks out in the kitchen, for example, 
the insurance company pays to fix the smoke and fire damage. If a hail-
storm breaks a window, you’re covered. If burglars steal your television, 
you’ll get money to replace it. Most policies also cover personal property 
you temporarily remove from the home, like a laptop computer that’s sto-
len from your car.  
You may need supplemental coverage for these circumstances:
•	 Structures and fixtures that aren’t part of your house. Examples 
include a separate garage or shed, barns or workshops, fences, walk-
ways, and the driveway.
•	 Landscaping, including trees, shrubs, and other plants.
•	 Loss of use, which pays for your lodging and meals (beyond an estab-
lished normal cost) if your house is so damaged that you have to move 
out while you have it repaired or rebuilt. Standard policies cover loss of 
use for a year; you can buy two-year coverage if you prefer. The latter is 
can be a good idea if you’ve got to rebuild from the ground up.
•	 Personal property. For some policies, you need to make a list of per-
sonal property, such as jewelry, computers, and artwork; they cover 
these items up to a set amount. If you want protection beyond that, 
you can buy additional coverage.

Prepare for the Closing 
275
•	 Property related to a home business, such as office equipment and 
inventory.
Be aware that standard homeowner’s policy doesn’t cover some hazards, 
so look carefully. Damage from these causes is typically excluded:
•	 Flooding
•	 Earthquakes
•	 Mudslides
•	 War or law-enforcement activity
•	 Power outages
•	 Sewer back-ups
•	 Vermin
•	 Dry rot
•	 Poor maintenance
•	 Vacancy of 60 days or longer
You may be able to buy supplemental coverage for some of these hazards 
(the next two sections discuss flood and earthquake insurance), but it can 
be expensive and some insurers don’t offer it.
Flood insurance
Standard homeowner’s policies don’t cover damage from flooding. In-
stead, you buy flood insurance from the federal government’s National 
Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). You can learn about NFIP’s residential 
coverage policies at www.floodsmart.gov. 
If you’re in a designated flood zone, your lender will require that you buy 
flood insurance. But you may want to consider buying a policy anyway, no 
matter where you live. Even areas that aren’t at regular risk of flooding can 
end up flooded when a nearby river overflows, a deep snow cover melts 
quickly, or heavy rains fall day after day. NFIP covers up to $250,000 for 
house damage and $100,000 for personal property damage. If you want 
more coverage, talk to an independent insurance agent who can help you 
find a private company that sells supplemental flood coverage.

Risk Profile to check. Go to www.floodsmart.gov and fill out the profile form. Click

premiums, and contact info for insurance agents in your area.

Chapter 11
276
Earthquake insurance
Earthquake damage is excluded from standard homeowners policies, so 
if you live in an area where earthquakes are a concern, buy coverage. You 
can add a rider to your standard policy or buy a separate policy. 
Liability Insurance
When you become a homeowner, you’re responsible for what happens 
on your property. Liability insurance protects you if someone is injured on 
your property or by a member of your household. Coverage is twofold:
•	 Medical bills. This pays the medical bills of “other people” (that is, 
people who don’t live in your household) if they’re injured on your 
property. It also pays other people’s medical bills if a member of your 
household (including most pets) injures someone while not on your 
property. Policies cap medical liability at a certain amount, usually 
$100,000. With medical costs skyrocketing, it’s a good idea to buy ad-
ditional coverage—aim for at least $1,000,000.
•	 Personal liability. If someone sues you for personal injury or for dam-
age to their property, this covers your legal fees and any damages you 
have to pay, up to a certain limit. Coverage includes incidents that oc-
cur on or off your property caused by any member of your household.
To protect yourself from any of the situations below, you have to get sup-
plemental liability coverage:
•	 Injuries caused while driving (this is covered by your auto insurance 
policy, not your homeowners policy)
•	 Liability related to a home business you operate
•	 Injuries to domestic workers, such as a housekeeper or nanny
•	 Injuries to tenants
Liability related to pets is also a tricky issue. In some states, insurers can 
refuse to cover pets or can charge a higher premium for exotic pets or cer-
tain breeds of dog, including German shepherds, rottweilers, huskies, and 
pit bulls. In other states, insurers can’t refuse coverage based on a dog’s 
breed—they can only do so if an individual dog has a recorded history of 
causing injury or damage.

Types of Homeowner’s Policies
Insurers use standard forms to write homeowner’s insurance policies. Most 
commonly, they use the forms below:
•	 HO-1. This policy offers the most basic coverage, insuring against fire, 
lightning, windstorm, hail, vandalism, theft, damage from vehicles and 
aircraft, explosions, riots or civil commotion, glass breakage, smoke, 
volcanic eruptions, and personal liability. It protects your home’s con-
tents, but you must list items separately to receive coverage.
•	 HO-2. Called “broad coverage,” this policy covers everything in HO-1 
and adds these hazards: building collapse; freezing or discharge of wa-
ter or steam from plumbing, heating, or air-conditioning systems; fall-
ing objects; damage from the weight of snow, ice, or sleet; and rupture 
of steam or hot water heating systems. 
•	 HO-3. Your insurance agent may refer to this as an “all-risk” policy, and 
it offers the broadest coverage (it also costs the most). Instead of list-
ing specific hazards it covers, as the two policies above do, it lists only 
the hazards it excludes, such as floods and earthquakes. You can, how-
ever, buy riders that cover most excluded hazards. (If you need flood 
insurance, you can buy it from the government, as page 275 explains.)
•	 HO-6. This is a policy designed for condominium and co-op owners. It 
covers the contents of your home, personal liability, and can fill in gaps 
not covered by your condo association or co-op’s insurance policy.
•	 HO-8. This policy is designed for older homes. Their old-fashioned 
building materials, such as plaster walls and slate roofs, can be prohibi-
tively expensive to replace if the home is damaged or destroyed. If re-
placing your home would cost more than its market value, this policy 
insures your home at market value. A “modified replacement policy” 
will replace old-fashioned materials with their current counterparts—
dry wall instead of plaster, for example.
Because it offers the most thorough coverage, most homeowners buy an HO-3 
policy.

•	 Make sure you’re insuring for the right amount. Pay attention to 
your policy limit. This amount, which appears on your policy’s decla-
rations page, determines the maximum you’ll get if your home is de-
stroyed. For example, say you insure your three-bedroom, two-bath 
home for $200,000, the price you paid for it. A few years later, a fire 
destroys the home. Building costs have gone up, and a new home with 
three bedrooms and two baths now costs $250,000. Because your poli-
cy limit is $200,000, your insurer won’t pay more than that, so you have 
to make up the difference or settle for less in your replacement home. 
Talk to your insurance agent about building costs per square foot to 
make sure you’re buying enough coverage to replace your home. (Or 
ask about an extended or guaranteed replacement cost policy, de-
scribed in the next bullet point.)
•	 Insure the structure for extended or guaranteed replacement cost. 
If a fire destroys your house, for example, these options insure that you 
can rebuild a home that’s similar even if building costs are on the rise. 
“Extended replacement cost” covers the home’s insured value plus ac-
tual building costs and pays out a certain amount above the policy 
limit—usually 120 or 125 percent. “Guaranteed replacement cost” is 
similar but comes without a cap. These options make your policy more 
expensive than actual value or plain-vanilla replacement cost policies, 
but if your home is destroyed, you won’t have to settle for less than 
what you had.
•	 Insure your possessions for replacement cost. Most homeowner’s 
policies cover your possessions, usually for up to 40 percent of your 
home’s value. If your home is insured for $200,000, for example, the 
insurer covers your possessions for up to $80,000. This coverage is 
usually actual value coverage, which takes depreciation into account. 
Here’s what that means: If you bought a computer for $1,000 a few 
years ago and the computer is now worth $200, your insurance covers 
the computer’s loss for $200. For a little more money, however, you can 
insure your possessions for replacement cost. With this kind of policy, if 
something you own is damaged or stolen, the insurer pays the cost to 
replace the item at current prices—no depreciation involved.

279
•	 Know exactly what’s covered. Although most policies cover the con-
tents and structure of your home in case of damage from fire, hail, 
wind, explosion, and theft, standard homeowners insurance doesn’t 
protect against flooding or earthquake damage. If you need that kind 
of coverage, you need to augment your standard policy with an addi-
tion to the policy called a rider (which will cost you more).
•	 Consider a high deductible. An insurance policy’s deductible is the 
money you pay out of pocket when you file a claim—in other words, 
you have to pay the deductible before the insurance company shells 
out any money. Raising the amount of the deductible lowers your in-
surance premium because it reduces the insurer’s risk. Of course, go-
ing with a higher deductible represents a gamble: If disaster strikes 
and you have to file a claim, you’ll pay the high deductible first. But for 
many homeowners, the savings realized through years of lower pre-
miums makes that gamble worthwhile. If you decide to go with a high 
deductible, check with your lender; many banks limit the size of the 
deductible.
•	 Make your home less of a risk. Install smoke and carbon monoxide 
detectors and a security system. You may be able to talk the seller into 
doing this as a condition of the sale. If not, make these improvements 
after you take possession of your home and present your insurer with 
evidence that you’ve done so.
•	 Shop around. All insurers are not created equal. Once you determine 
your insurance needs, check with several companies about the poli-
cies they offer and go for the best value.
•	 Bundle your policies. Many insurers offer discounts if you have more 
than one policy with them. If the company that insures your car also 
offers homeowners insurance, see if they can give you the best deal.
Get a Home Warranty
When you buy a new car, it comes with a warranty, a guarantee that the car 
and all its parts will function the way they’re supposed to for a designated 
period of time or use. Your home is an even bigger investment, and many 
homebuyers want a similar guarantee—along with the peace of mind it 
brings. If that sounds like you, you’re probably thinking about buying a 
home warranty. 

Chapter 11
280
Warranties for Existing Homes
Home warranties can cost anywhere from $250 to $900 a year (depending 
on the coverage you choose) but average from $300 to $400. They typically 
cover the systems and appliances that come with your home, including:
•	 Electrical system
•	 Plumbing system (including toilets but excluding private well pumps, 
septic systems, and fixtures such as faucets and shower heads)
•	 Heating and cooling system (including ductwork but excluding heat 
registers and in-window air conditioners)
•	 Water heater
•	 Telephone wiring
•	 Dishwasher
•	 Refrigerator (excluding ice maker)
•	 Stove
•	 Ceiling and exhaust fans
•	 Sump pump (which removes water from a wet basement)
If you want, you can buy additional coverage (at additional cost) for these 
items:
•	 Faucets and shower heads
•	 Well pumps
•	 Septic tank pumps
•	 Heating registers and grills
•	 Window-mounted air conditioners
•	 Refrigerator ice makers
•	 Smoke detectors
•	 Garage door openers
•	 Swimming pools
•	 Washers and dryers
•	 Roofs (limited coverage)
If an appliance breaks down or something goes wrong with a central sys-
tem, you call the warranty company, which puts you in touch with a repair 
person. You pay a fixed service fee (usually $50 to $100), and the company 
picks up the rest of the tab. If a broken appliance can’t be fixed, the war-
ranty pays for a new one, including installation.

Prepare for the Closing 
281
A home warranty sounds like a good idea, but in practice, the fine print 
in these warranties tend to exclude a lot: preexisting conditions, poor in-
stallation, hard-to-access areas, substandard maintenance, and anything 
beyond normal wear and tear. With all those exclusions, it can be difficult 
to get a claim approved—if you forget to have your furnace serviced once 
a year, for example, you might be out of luck when the furnace dies. Read 
the contract carefully before you sign it, keeping an eye out for loopholes. 
For example, many warranty companies require homeowners to update 
mechanical and electrical systems to current building codes (at your ex-
pense) before it will cover those systems.  
Some states regulate the companies that offer home warranties; others 
don’t. If you’re thinking about buying a policy, find out whether your state 
does and check with the regulatory agency for complaints against specific 
companies. Otherwise, you can go online and check for complaints at con-
sumer websites like Ripoff Report (www.ripoffreport.com) and Consumer-
Affairs.com (www.consumeraffairs.com). 
Often, a seller will pay for a one-year home warranty to entice buyers and 
give them confidence in the home. You can use the home warranty as a 
bargaining chip (instead of shelling out $300 or $400 for the home war-
ranty, maybe the seller could install a new dishwasher), or you can accept 
it, since someone else is paying for it, and see whether you like it during 
the first year. 
Warranties for New Construction
If the purpose of a warranty is to protect a previously lived-in home as 
though it’s brand new, what about new construction? Do you need a 
home warranty when you buy a brand-new house? Yes, you do. A house 
that’s never been lived in can develop problems with appliances and sys-
tems that haven’t been tested by day-to-day use. 
Although you should make sure your newly constructed home has a 
warranty, you shouldn’t have to pay for it. In many cases, the builder war-
ranties that, if a problem arises, he‘ll fix it. In other cases, the builder buys a 
traditional warranty for the first year (or for the first several years) you live 
in the house. When you buy new construction, a home warranty is a sign 
that the builder stands behind his work. Be suspicious of any builder who 
doesn’t offer one.
Emergencies happen. It’s a good idea to set up an emergency repair fund of at 
least $5,000. Even if you don’t have that much money to spare, make it a priority to 
build up a reserve so you have funds available if you need them. If you decide not 
to buy a home warranty, add the money you’d have spent to your emergency fund.

Chapter 11
282
A typical builder’s warranty protects you against defects in the materials 
and workmanship of the structure and its systems, from foundation to 
roof, for the first year after closing. In addition, most warranties cover the 
building’s central systems for two years and its structure for 10. Your builder 
may inspect the home during the first year—which is a good thing, be-
cause the inspection can find and fix small problems before they become 
full-blown emergencies.
As with any warranty, read a builder’s warranty carefully. It excludes some 
things: appliances under a manufacturer’s warranty, everyday wear and 
tear, normal “settling” of the building, soil conditions, and any drainage 
problems caused by landscaping you do (or have done). The warranty 
might also specify the hours and days when the builder will be available to 
address non-emergency problems the warranty covers.  
Prepare to Move
As if getting ready to close on your house doesn’t already put enough 
on your plate, you also have to get ready to move into your new home. 
Whether you move across town or across the country, whether you pack 
and haul everything yourself or hire professionals, you need to make ar-
rangements well in advance so that your move goes smoothly. 
As soon as you know your closing date, pick a moving day. You might want 
to give yourself a few days to clean and prepare your new house before 
you move into it. Decide how you’re going to move: Will you do it yourself 
or work with a professional moving company? Professional movers can do 
everything from packing your stuff to moving it to unpacking it in your 
new home and taking away the mountain of empty boxes—or you can 
pick and choose the services you want. Maybe you’d prefer to pack every-
thing yourself, for example, and hire movers to get your belongings from 
the old place to the new one. 
Many states have laws requiring warranties that all builders must comply with. This 
kind of implied warranty may be in effect in your state, even if it’s not explicitly 
mentioned in your builder’s warranty. Contact your state attorney general’s office 
or Contractors Licensing Board to get the details on your state’s requirements.
If you decide to hire professional movers, ask your friends, buyer’s agent, neigh-
bors, and family members for recommendations. Even if you don’t know anyone 
who’s moved recently, a friend or acquaintance may be able to put you in touch 
with someone who has.

Troubleshooting Moment
Avoiding Mover Scams
You may have heard horror stories about scam movers who demand a big deposit 
and then never show up on moving day or who hold people’s possessions hostage 
until they pay an amount three or four times greater than the original estimate. 
Don’t get scammed. If you plan to use a professional mover, follow these tips:   
•	 Choose a local mover. Most scammers operate online only. Work with an es-
tablished local company whose office you can visit. 
•	 Get in-person estimates. Don’t settle for an estimate that you get from a 
phone call or by filling out an online form. To get the most accurate estimate, 
have someone from the moving company look around your home to see what 
you’ll be moving. Get written estimates from at least three different companies. 
•	 Be suspicious of lowball estimates. If one estimate comes in much lower than 
the others, it’s probably too good to be true.
•	 Get referrals and references. If you know someone who’s moved recently, ask 
which mover they used and what they thought of the experience. And before 
you choose a mover, ask for references from previous customers, then call and 
ask whether those customers were happy with the mover’s work.
•	 Get a list of reliable movers. The American Moving and Storage Association 
(AMSA) is the national trade association for professional movers. AMSA’s web-
site (www.promover.org) lists certified ProMovers, who must pass criminal back-
ground checks and agree to ethical standards (such as honesty in advertising 
and all business transactions). You can also use AMSA’s referral service to re-
quest quotes from up to six prescreened ProMovers local to your area. 
•	 Check reviews. Consumers use review websites like Yelp (www.yelp.com) and 
MoverReviews.com (www.moverreviews.com) to rate and write detailed reviews 
of moving companies they’ve worked with.  
•	 Ask for the FMCSA Rights and Responsibilities booklet. By law, a mover 
must give you a copy of “Your Rights and Responsibilities When You Move,” a 
publication of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA). If a 
mover can’t or won’t provide you with a copy, look elsewhere.
•	 Don’t hand over a large deposit before the move. Scammers often demand 
a big chunk of cash up front—and then never appear to move your stuff. It’s 
not unreasonable for a mover to ask for a deposit of $100 to $200 to cover their 
costs if you change your mind, but if a mover wants more up front—like 25 
percent of the cost of the move—don’t pay it.   
•	 Get everything in writing. Make sure the mover’s estimate includes the cost of 
the move and any extra charges (for packing boxes, tape, wrapping materials, 
and so on). Don’t ever sign a blank contract that the mover fills in later. 
•	 Check for past complaints. Contact your local Better Business Bureau to see 
whether anyone has filed a complaint there about the mover. If you’re moving 
from one state to another, you can also search for complaints filed with FMCSA 
(which regulates interstate moves) at http://tinyurl.com/yajquhe.

For a smooth move, think ahead. Unlike Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz, 
you’re not going to look out the window one day and discover you’re not 
in Kansas any more. A move happens in stages—and staying on top of 
those stages at the right time is the secret to a successful move. Use the 
to-do lists in this section as a starting point for your own, adding any tasks 
your situation requires. 
Four to Six Weeks Before You Move
Start early. As soon as you choose a moving date, check these tasks off 
your list:
•	 If you handle the move yourself, compare prices from truck rental com-
panies and reserve a truck. Buy moving boxes and start packing things 
you know you won’t need for a while: nonseasonal tools and clothes, 
books you won’t read in the next few weeks, and so on.
•	 If you hire professional movers, contact three companies to get esti-
mates. Each company will send a representative to your home to look 
at how much you’ve got to move and give you a ballpark of what it will 
cost to move it.
•	 If you plan to do any redecorating before you move to your new home, 
such as painting or installing carpets, get estimates and set up ap-
pointments to have the work done. If you plan to have the work done 
before you move in, consider how these appointments affect your 
moving date. 
•	 If you’re renting your current home, give your landlord notice that 
you’ll be moving out. Depending on your situation, you may need to 
find a new tenant to sublet your apartment or pay overlapping rent 
and mortgage payments to avoid breaking your lease.
This book’s missing CD has a checklist you can print out that lists what you need to 
do to prepare for your move. Find it at www.missingmanuals.com. 
Preparing for a move is a great time to weed out possessions you don’t really 
need or want. Hold a yard sale, list them in the classifieds, give them to friends, or 
donate them to charity.

285
Two Weeks Before You Move
As moving day approaches, send out word about your new address and 
accelerate your preparations. Here’s what you need to do:
•	 Call utility companies and arrange to begin service in your new home 
on the day of the closing and end service the day after you move out of 
your current home. Be sure to contact all of the following utility com-
panies that apply:
—
— Electricity
—
— Heating fuel (natural gas, automatic oil delivery, automatic pro-
pane delivery)
—
— Water
—
— Telephone
—
— Cable
—
— Satellite television
—
— Internet service
•	 File a change of address form at the post office or online (www.usps.com).
•	 Notify anyone who regularly sends you mail (credit card companies, 
student loan institutions, magazines you subscribe to, college alumni 
association, and so on) of your new address.
•	 Return library books and any locally rented DVDs.
•	 Order checks that display your new address. If you’re moving to a new 
area, open a bank account there.
•	 If you’re packing up your belongings yourself, start or continue packing.
House plants can be difficult to move. Some states regulate the kinds of plants 
you can bring in, and moving companies may transport plants with restrictions: 
only for moves of less than 150 miles and/or delivery within 24 hours, for example. 
Plants move best in a climate-controlled environment (such as your car) and in 
unbreakable plastic containers (as opposed to clay or ceramic pots). If you have 
houseplants you can’t take with you, try to find them new homes at least a couple 
of weeks before you move.

Chapter 11
286
One Week Before You Move
As moving day approaches, make sure preparations and plans are still on 
track and make your final preparations for the move:
•	 Check with your real estate agent, loan officer or mortgage broker and 
closing agent or attorney to make sure that everything is on track for 
the closing and to confirm the date.
•	 If you reserved a rental truck, double-check your reservation.
•	 If you hired professional movers, confirm the date.
•	 Set aside a couple of boxes and a suitcase or two for the essential items 
you’ll need immediately in your new home: medications, toiletries, tow-
els, sheets and pillows, some changes of clothes, and the items you’d 
pack for a short trip. It will take days to get everything put away and 
organized in your new home, so make sure essentials are accessible.
•	 If you’re doing the packing, take things one room at a time and clean 
each room as you finish packing it. Don’t pack your cleaning tools, 
though—you’ll want to give the place a final once-over after it’s empty.
Take the Final Walkthrough
Weeks—or sometimes months—can pass between the time you make an 
offer on a house and the day you take possession of it. In between, things 
can happen that affect the home’s condition—an appliance might go ka-
put, the owners’ toddler could dump a half-gallon of grape juice on the 
white living-room carpet, the roof could spring a leak. That’s why you put a 
final walkthrough contingency in your purchase agreement (page 253)—
so you can check for last-minute problems before the house becomes 
yours. You can print out a checklist of everything you should look for in 
your final walkthrough from this book’s Missing CD at www.missingmanu-
als.com/cds/.
On moving day, transport the essentials yourself. You don’t want to risk losing 
your medications, for example, among the mountain of boxes crammed into the 
mover’s truck. If you’re renting a truck and moving yourself, keep the essentials 
separate from the bulk of your stuff so you can easily find them when you need 
them.

Prepare for the Closing 
287
If the home has been sitting vacant, problems might go unnoticed and 
unrepaired, until you have the bad luck to discover them after closing. 
You don’t want to find that a burst pipe has flooded the house or that 
the seller has removed appliances or fixtures that were supposed to con-
vey with the sale. If the seller is still living in the home or has recently 
moved out, check to make sure no recent damage has occurred—walls 
and floors can get pretty banged up when the seller moves his furniture 
and personal property.
What to Look for on the Final Walkthrough
Although a “walkthrough” sounds like a quick, casual check, dispel that no-
tion. Take your time. Don’t get distracted by deciding whether the sofa 
should go against the far wall or under the window—you’ll figure that out 
later. Your priority is to make sure the house is in the condition you ex-
pect. If the seller made repairs and you haven’t inspected the work, you 
might want to ask a professional to walk through with you, to make sure 
the repairs are complete. Also, bring a camera so you can document any 
problems.
In all likelihood, the next time you walk through the house, it’ll be yours. 
Make sure it’s in the shape you expect by doing a thorough check of all ar-
eas of the home, inside and out. Print out the Final Walkthrough Checklist 
from the book’s Missing CD (www.missingmanuals.com) and bring it with 
you. Here’s a summary of what you’re looking for: 
•	 Outside the home:
—
— Visually inspect the home’s exterior, including the roof, siding, 
shutters and trim, and so on, looking for any changes since you 
signed the purchase agreement. 
—
— Inspect the driveway and walkways.
—
— Check the grounds—are the trees and landscaping the same as 
when you made the offer? 
If you took photos when you toured the home or during the home inspection, take 
them along to the final walkthrough. Use them to compare the condition of the 
home when you made the offer with its current condition.

Chapter 11
288
•	 Interior rooms (general):
—
— Open, close, and lock/unlock all doors.
—
— Open, close, and lock/unlock all windows, and check for missing or 
damaged screens.
—
— In each room, inspect the ceilings, floors, and walls for physical 
damage (such as dings, gouges, or scuffs that the seller may have 
left when he moved out) and water damage (stains, dampness, 
soft spots).
—
— Check the cleanliness of any carpets.
—
— Make sure closets are cleaned out.
•	 Kitchen:
—
— Open the fridge to make sure it works.
—
— Turn on all the stove’s burners and oven.
—
— Test the light and fan in the range hood.
—
— Turn on the dishwasher.
—
— Run the garbage disposal.
—
— Test any other appliances.
—
— Run both the hot and cold water in the sink; check for clogged 
drains and in the cabinet underneath for signs of a leak.
•	 Bathroom:
—
— Run water in sink to check water pressure.
—
— As the water runs, check under the sink for leaks.
—
— Turn on faucets in the tub/shower.
—
— Check for clogged drains.
—
— Flush toilet.
—
— Turn on the exhaust fan.
•	 Utility room:
—
— Turn on the washer and dryer.
•	 Garage:
—
— Test the automatic door opener.
•	 Attic and basement:
—
— Look for areas that are damp, wet, musty-smelling, or show visible 
mold.

289
•	 Electrical system:
—
— Turn each light switch on and off. 
—
— Turn on ceiling fans and exhaust fans.
—
— Test electrical outlets.
•	 Heating/cooling system:
—
— Turn up the thermostat a few degrees and make sure the heat 
comes on.
—
— If the home has central air conditioning, turn down the thermostat 
and verify that the air conditioner comes on.
•	 Miscellaneous:
—
— Confirm that all conveyances remain in the home.
—
— Make sure there’s no trash or debris left behind.
—
— Check that the seller removed all his personal property.
—
— Check that the seller has made all agreed-upon repairs.
—
— Ring the doorbell.
—
— If there’s a security system, test it.
—
— Make sure you have the owner’s manuals for all major appliances 
(furnace, central air conditioner, and so on).
—
— Test railings on stairs, decks, and porches to make sure they’re 
firmly attached.
—
— Check that any built-in shelving is stable.
—
— If there’s a fireplace, make sure it’s clean; open and close the flue.
Bring along a list of issues that the home inspector found that weren’t serious 
enough to require repairs. Check that these problems haven’t gotten worse since 
the inspection.
Before the final walkthrough, make sure the security service has your phone num-
ber as the designated contact. You don’t want to set off the alarm and have no way 
to stop it.

What to Do If You Find a Problem
Most of the time, the final walkthrough is just that—a final look at the 
house before the closing. But if you find one or more problems you need 
to deal with, contact your real estate agent immediately so she can get in 
touch with the seller and open negotiations. When a house doesn’t pass 
your walkthrough inspection, you have these options:
•	 The seller returns money to you for repairs. This can happen at the 
closing; the seller returns some of your purchase price so you can fix 
the problem. If it’s a relatively small amount of money—say a few hun-
dred dollars—the seller might give you cash. For pricier repairs, the 
seller may have the closing agent or your attorney put the money in 
escrow. As a contractor makes the repairs, your attorney pays for them 
with money from the account. 
•	 The seller reduces the purchase price. Unrepaired damage to a 
house reduces its value, so you can renegotiate the final purchase 
price, reducing it by the amount of the repairs. 
•	 You cancel the sale. If your purchase agreement has a final walk-
through contingency (page 253), you can invoke that contingency and 
cancel the sale if there’s a significant problem. If the seller feels you’re 
making a frivolous claim, though, he may try to keep some (or all) of 
your earnest money.
If the seller has left junk behind on the property, find out how much it would cost 
to have it hauled away. Ask the seller to put that amount of money into an escrow 
account and get a written agreement that the seller will remove the junk by a cer-
tain date—if not, you can use the escrow money to pay someone to take it away.
For big repair jobs, get estimates before you negotiate. Know how much the re-
pairs are likely to cost so you request enough money from the seller to cover them 
fully.
Negotiations may delay the closing. If that happens, consider asking the seller to 
pay for any costs you incur because of the delay, such as furniture storage and 
hotel bills.

Y
our prospective new home looked great when you toured it with 
your agent, but you don’t know what problems are hiding, waiting 
to jump out and yell, “Surprise!” once you move in. According to 
HouseMaster, a home inspection franchiser, a study of more than 2,000 
home inspection reports found that 40 percent of inspected homes had 
at least one major defect that would cost several hundred to several thou-
sand dollars to repair. Most problems arose in roofs, electrical systems, 
plumbing systems, central heating and cooling systems, insulation, and 
the home’s structure. That’s a long list of potential gotchas—and most 
homebuyers wouldn’t begin to know how to search for them. That’s why, 
before any money changes hands, you need an expert to evaluate these 
systems (and others). That’s the role of your home inspector.
You probably put a home inspection contingency (page 252) in your pur-
chase agreement. Now, it’s time to get that inspection done. This chapter 
walks you through a typical home inspection, showing you, step-by-step, 
what a home inspector looks for. It also offers advice on finding a good 
home inspector and a list of specialized inspections you might want to 
have done. The last section tells you how to address any problems that 
come up (and they will—there’s no such thing as a perfect home).

Chapter 12
292
What a Home Inspector Does
A professional home inspector usually has a background in construction, 
engineering, or both. He gives your house a thorough going-over, checking 
its systems, structure, materials, and condition. He compares the condi-
tion of the house to current building standards and alerts you to potential 
problems. The inspector won’t fix (or arrange to fix) anything, but his re-
port shows you what needs repair—now and down the road—so you can 
decide whether to buy the house in its current condition, ask the seller for 
repairs or a credit, or cancel the sale (go to this book’s Missing CD at www.
missingmanuals.com/cds/ to see an example home inspection report).
Home inspectors inspect only the parts of your house that he can access 
and view. For example, while he might suspect and report a potential 
problem with your foundation, he won’t dig down to confirm it. (In a case 
like that, you need to hire a foundation engineer to do a specialized in-
spection—page 304 tells you more about specialized inspections.) Home 
inspectors observe and note the house’s condition, but they don’t guaran-
tee that condition or provide a home warranty. 
Find a Good Home Inspector
Because a home inspection is so important, you want the best inspector 
you can find. Your real estate agent, attorney, or lender may have a list of 
inspectors they recommend. Use this as a starting point. You should also 
check with friends, neighbors, and acquaintances for recommendations; 
someone who’s had personal experience with a home inspector can fill 
you in on the results of his work. Even if they had the inspection done a 
couple of years ago, the homeowner can tell you how thorough and ac-
curate it was.
Before you hire a home inspector, ask several about their rates, and inter-
view the most promising ones (see page 102 for a list of questions). 
A home inspector doesn’t provide an assessment of your home’s value, either, so 
don’t even ask—that’s an appraiser’s job.
Although you can begin looking for a home inspector with your agent’s list of 
recommendations, look beyond that list, too. A tough inspector who has a reputa-
tion for warning potential buyers away from problematic homes may not be too 
popular with agents—but can be your best friend in making sure the home is 
structurally sound.

can tell you about licensing and other regulations in your state. For a list 
of law libraries, visit the American Association of Law Libraries at http://
aallnet.org/sis/sccll and click the Libraries link.) In addition, home inspec-
tors can join (and abide by the tenets of) several professional associations. 
Each has its own professional standards, a code of ethics, and educational 
and other resources for members. So if a home inspector belongs to one or 
more of the associations below, consider that a good sign:
•	 American Society of Home Inspectors (ASHI; www.ashi.org). With 
more than 6,000 members and 80 chapters across the U.S. and Canada, 
this is the largest professional association of home inspectors in North 
America. Full ASHI members have passed two written exams and have 
conducted at least 250 paid home inspections. 
•	 International Association of Certified Home Inspectors (InterNA-
CHI; www.nachi.org). To become InterNACHI-certified, a home inspec-
tor must pass a written exam, complete an ethics course, and take a 
standards-of-practice quiz. Renewing members must satisfy continu-
ing education requirements.
•	 National Association of Home Inspectors (NAHI; www.nahi.org). Es-
tablished in 1987, NAHI has more than 2,000 members, with chapters 
throughout the U.S. and Canada. To join, members must complete a 
40-hour home inspection-training program or have conducted at least 
20 home inspections for paying clients. As an inspector gains more 
experience, he moves up to higher levels of membership.
What Happens at an Inspection
After you choose an inspector and make an appointment for the inspec-
tion, clear the date and time with the seller to ensure your inspector has 
access to the house. Your real estate agent, the seller’s agent, and the seller 
can all attend the inspection—and you should be there, too. While home 
inspectors report all the problems they find—large and small, urgent and

not so urgent, being there lets you take a look, ask questions, and get a 
sense of whether you need to make immediate repairs. There’s a world of 
difference between seeing with your own eyes and reading a report.
A thorough inspection of a typical single-family home can easily take two 
hours, longer if the house is old or large. Budget ample time and don’t get 
impatient—you don’t want the inspector to rush and miss something im-
portant. This section describes what the home inspector examines.
Exterior
Your home inspector will probably begin with the outside of the house. 
Here’s what he’s looking at:
•	 Wall covering materials (such as siding or stucco)
•	 Flashing and trim. Flashing is a weatherproofing material often found 
around structures that interrupt a house’s siding or roof, like a kitchen 
exhaust fan or a skylight. It provides a seamless barrier between the 
existing siding or roof and the house itself, preventing water from en-
tering at an angle or joint.
•	 Eaves, soffits, and fascias visible from ground level

•	 Exterior doors
•	 Windows
•	 Structures such as decks, porches, and staircases that are attached to 
the home, along with their railings
•	 Exterior lights
•	 Walkways, driveways, and patios that are adjacent to the house or lead 
to its entrances
•	 Landscaping and vegetation (such as trees) that may cause problems, 
like roots that could interfere with water pipes
•	 Grading and surface drainage to see whether water flows toward or 
away from the home
•	 Retaining walls
Structural Components
You want to make sure the “bones” of your house—the structural compo-
nents that hold it together—are sound, because these kinds of repairs are 
costly. 
Your home inspector checks these components and probes any that show 
signs of damage or deterioration. He’ll poke at wood that looks like it’s rot-
ting, for example. If there’s no visual clue to a problem, the inspector won’t 
do any probing.
Here are the elements the inspector checks:
•	 Foundation
•	 Crawl space (if applicable)
•	 Attic framing
•	 Floors
•	 Walls
•	 Ceilings
An eave is the edge of a roof that extends beyond the building. A soffit, the under-
side of an eave, often has air vents to ventilate a home’s attic. And a fascia is the 
horizontal facing board that covers the ends of the roof rafters outside the home.

Chapter 12
296
Roof and Attic
Water is the enemy of many building materials, including wood, metal, and 
masonry. It causes rot, rust, and crumbling. It makes a nice home for mold 
and mildew. And in cold climates, it freezes and expands, damaging pipes 
and any other material it seeps into (like a crack in a masonry wall). So you 
want to make sure water hasn’t gotten into places it doesn’t belong—par-
ticularly through the roof and around the foundation (page 310).
Some home inspectors will climb a ladder and walk around a low-pitched 
roof to inspect it. Others offer only a visual inspection, using binoculars 
(you can ask inspectors their method when you interview them). Either 
way, the inspector won’t guarantee the condition of a roof or estimate how 
long it’ll last (to find that out, have a certified roofing company do an in-
spection—read more about roof certifications on page 309).
But your home inspector will identify the type of roof construction and the 
materials that went into it. He’ll also check:
•	 The roof’s drainage system and gutters
•	 Any flashing
•	 Skylights, chimneys, and any other structures that go through the roof
If the house has an accessible attic, the inspector checks for damage from 
water or animals (such as squirrels, raccoons, or bats) and looks at these 
elements:
•	 The framing
•	 The underside of the roof
•	 The insulation
•	 The ventilation
Plumbing
The signs of a good plumbing system include water that flows easily (no 
banging or hesitation), good water pressure, and a lack of leaks. Your home 
inspector looks at:
•	 The materials and condition of all the pipes (including the pipes that 
carry drinking and waste water, drain pipes, and vent pipes)
Poor attic ventilation is a major cause of roof damage. When air can’t circulate, frost 
can damage the underside of the roof (in cold climates) and high temperatures 
can damage roof boards and the asphalt shingles that cover them.

•	 Sinks and faucets

Electrical System
A home’s electrical system does more than run the TV and illuminate the 
house—it’s vital to many core systems, like refrigeration/cooking and heat-
ing/cooling, so it needs to be maintained. In addition, an electrical system 
in disrepair is a potential fire hazard.
Most home inspectors don’t look at private wells, septic systems, solar water heat-
ers, water softening or conditioning equipment, or lawn sprinkler systems. If you 
want any of these inspected, contact a company that specializes in the equipment.
Up to Speed
Polybutylene Pipes
If the house you’re considering was built between 1970 and the mid-1990s (or had 
plumbing work done during that time), watch out for polybutylene pipes. These 
plastic resin pipes were cheap to make and easy to install, so they became popular 
with builders and plumbers who preferred them to pricier copper pipe.
The problem is that they degrade—and then they leak. If they were used in hot wa-
ter systems, they can develop cracks. And the chlorine that keeps public water sup-
plies clean makes the pipes brittle, leading to flaking and cracking. Eventually, the 
pipes can leak or break—and then you have an expensive problem on your hands. 
Between 6 million and 10 million homes in the U.S. have polybutylene pipes. 
They’re most popular throughout the southern states, the Pacific Northwest, and 
mid-Atlantic regions, but you can find them anywhere. If your home has them, con-
sider getting an estimate of how much it would cost to replace them. You’ll need 
that info whether you decide to negotiate with the seller about replacing the pipes 
now or whether you decide to buy the home with the pipes in place—because you 
may have to replace them some day.

Chapter 12
298
Your home inspector probably isn’t a licensed electrician, but he knows 
about electrical source, circuitry, and general voltage and amp require-
ments. The inspector won’t probe a home’s electrical system but he will 
visually inspect it, including:
•	 The service drop—that’s the power line that runs from the nearest util-
ity pole to your home
•	 Conductors, cables, and raceways (covers that encase wires that run 
along the outside of walls)
•	 Grounding
•	 Ground fault circuit interrupters
•	 Main service panels and circuit breakers, along with any subpanels
•	 Wiring
•	 Light switches
•	 Light fixtures
•	 Smoke detectors
Heating and Air Conditioning Systems
To make sure your new home will keep you comfortably warm in cold 
weather and cool in hot weather, the inspector looks at the heating and 
cooling systems. This is important for more than physical comfort; a mal-
functioning heating system can release poisonous carbon monoxide into 
a home. So a thorough inspection is important. If she suspects a problem 
such as overheating or inadequate ductwork, your home inspector may 
recommend a specialized HVAC inspection (page 299).
The inspector tells you the kind of heating system you have and what fuels 
it, and checks these components:
•	 Furnace
•	 Central air conditioner
•	 Heat distribution system, including fans, pumps, ducts, and piping, 
with supports, insulation, air filters, registers, radiators, fan coil units, 
and convectors
•	 Thermostat
•	 Chimneys, flues, and vents, when they’re readily accessible

Insulation and Ventilation
Proper ventilation and insulation extends the life of a building. Your home 
needs to breathe, but you don’t want it to be drafty. Ventilation makes sure 
that air circulates, preventing moisture from building up where it can cause 
damage. Insulation minimizes heat transfer between your house and the 
outside world, keeping you cooler in summer and warmer in winter. The 
HVAC industry uses a measure called R-value to measure the efficiency 
of insulation. The higher the R-value, the more efficient the insulation. To 
check for proper insulation and ventilation, inspectors check:
•	 Insulation and vapor barriers in unfinished areas, such as the attic and 
the basement or crawl space
•	 The material and R-value of attic insulation
•	 Exhaust fans
•	 Ventilation systems in bathrooms, the kitchen, and the laundry area
Installed Appliances
The inspector checks built-in appliances that convey with the sale, such as 
the:
•	 Dishwasher
•	 Oven, range, and/or cooktop
•	 Range hood fan
•	 Built-in microwave
•	 Garbage disposal
•	 Trash compactor
Other Interior Features
As an inspector walks through your house, they take note of the condition 
of these features: 
•	 Stairs and railings
•	 Countertops and cabinets
•	 Windows
The inspector may photograph your house with an infrared camera to get a ther-
mographic image of the building, which shows where the insulation isn’t working.

Chapter 12

•	 Doors
•	 Fireplaces, along with their chimneys, fireboxes, and vents (if accessible)
Basement
If your house has a basement, the inspector looks at any systems that have 
components there, such as heating, electric, and plumbing. Other than 
those systems, the inspector’s main concern here is the presence of wa-
ter—and the problems this can cause, such as rotting wood or crumbling 
masonry.
These are all signs of a wet basement that a home inspector will look for:
•	 Dampness
•	 Water stains
•	 Efflorescence, a sparkly white or gray residue left behind on concrete, 
brick, or stone when water evaporates
•	 Spalling, a peeling or flaking that occurs when water gets inside 
masonry
•	 Musty odors
•	 Mold or mildew
Garage
If your home has a garage, whether it’s attached or detached, the home 
inspector examines the:
•	 Exterior
•	 Roof
•	 Slab or foundation on which the garage is built
•	 Walls and ceiling
•	 Doors
Your home inspector probably won’t open and close all the windows and cabinet 
doors. They tend to look at a representative number of these features.
If an inspector discovers mold in your house, you might want to get a specialized 
inspection—especially for black mold (page 306 tells you why).

What Your Home Inspector Won’t Do
Home inspectors take a good, hard look at your house and report their ob-
servations, but they don’t fix problems or offer engineering services (like 
redesigning the electrical or plumbing systems). They also don’t assess the 
value of your house or whether it’s suitable for specialized use, like a day-
care center. ASHI guidelines state that certain activities are beyond the 
scope of what a home inspector does, including these:
•	 A home inspector doesn’t have to inspect any system or structural 
element not readily accessible. Don’t expect an inspector to get out 
a shovel and start digging up the back lawn to look at a buried stor-
age tank or pipework. Nor will he move the current owner’s personal 
property or furniture, or clear away snow or debris to inspect some 
element of the house.
•	 A home inspector doesn’t offer professional services beyond the 
inspection itself. Some home inspectors work independently as con-
tractors. But if you want repair work done, you have to hire them in 
that capacity—as a builder, not an inspector.
•	 A home inspector doesn’t evaluate the strength, adequacy, effec-
tiveness, or efficiency of any system or component. The inspector 
also doesn’t speculate on the cause of problems or advise on their so-
lution. And don’t ask how long something is likely to last—the inspec-
tor may give you an informal answer, but it won’t be part of the official 
report.
•	 A home inspector doesn’t conduct specialized inspections. For 
example, the inspector won’t check for wood-destroying insects or 
evaluate whether mold growing in the basement represents a health 
hazard. The inspector might, however, recommend a special inspec-
tion based on observations he makes during the general inspection. 
•	 A home inspector doesn‘t estimate the cost of operating any of 
the property’s systems. If you want a sense of how much it costs to 
run the central air conditioner, for example, ask to see the owner’s util-
ity bills.
Page 304 explains the different kinds of specialized inspections you can get.

Chapter 12
302
•	 A home inspector doesn’t evaluate anything that’s not installed. 
That includes standalone appliances (like refrigerators) and fixtures 
(like floor lamps). And the inspector won’t inspect decorative fixtures 
like mini-blinds.
•	 A home inspector doesn’t evaluate structures that aren’t attached 
to the home. The exception is a garage or carport.
•	 If you’re having a condominium or a co-op inspected, the home 
inspector doesn’t inspect common areas. The inspector looks at the 
unit you want to purchase but not the lobby, hallways, elevators, laun-
dry room, and so on.
Understand Your Home  
Inspection Report
Soon after your home inspector finishes peering, poking, and prodding, 
he’ll send you a report that details everything he found (see the Missing 
CD at www.missingmanuals.com/cds/ to see a sample home inspection 
report). It‘s a comprehensive list of major and minor issues—everything 
from cracked window panes and missing light-switch covers to structural 
problems like a deteriorating roof or a crumbling foundation. Look for the 
report a day or two after the inspection. (If you don’t get it, give the inspec-
tor a nudge—some states limit the time in which you have to complete the 
inspection and deal with resulting issues.) If you attended the inspection, 
you should already have a pretty good idea of what the report will say.
During the inspection, your inspector probably carried a clipboard with 
forms he filled out as he examined the home or a used hand-held computer 
to record observations. These on-the-scene notes form the basis of his re-
port. Some reports are little more than checklists that indicate whether 
each element is acceptable or needs replacing. The best reports describe 
the condition of the house in long form—paragraphs that take the time to 
explain the problems. 
Even new construction needs a general home inspection. The builder may have 
cut corners. Common issues in new construction include improper grading, sewer 
connection problems, and ventilation and weatherproofing issues.

Most reports are several pages long and divided into sections. The first sec-
tion is boilerplate, detailing the services the inspector provided and limit-
ing his liability to the inspection fee you paid—in other words, if there’s a 
problem with the report, you can get your money back, but the inspector 
doesn’t owe you anything beyond that. Then he evaluates the house room 
Frequently Asked Question
The Not-So-Top Ten
What problems and issues appear most frequently during a home inspection?
Be on the lookout for these problems, which, according to a survey of ASHI mem-
bers, are most likely to turn up during a home inspection:
1.	 Improper surface grading and drainage. This problem, reported by 36 per-
cent of home inspectors, can mean that water is damaging the foundation and 
getting into the house. 
2.	 Improper and undersized electrical wiring. The second most-frequent prob-
lem shows up in the electrical system. Specific issues include insufficient elec-
trical service to the house, aluminum wiring, inadequate overload protection, 
improper grounding, and dangerous amateur wiring connections. Because a 
faulty electric system is a safety hazard, put problems like these high on your 
must-fix list.
3.	 Older and damaged roofs. Deteriorating shingles or poorly installed flashing 
can result in a leaky roof. 
4.	 Deficient and older heating systems. Heating system issues include bro-
ken or malfunctioning controls, blocked chimneys, unsafe exhaust flues, and 
cracked heat exchangers. As with the electrical system, a faulty heating system 
can pose a serious health risk.
5.	 Poor overall maintenance. This category reflects what happens when a 
homeowner doesn’t take proper care of his residence: cracked or peeling paint, 
crumbling masonry and broken fixtures and appliances may signify an owner 
who hasn’t paid much attention to maintenance.
6.	 Structural problems. Older homes are especially likely to have some dam-
age to foundation walls, floor joists, rafters, or windows and door frames. These 
problems are often minor—but ask.
7.	 Plumbing problems. Old piping material, broken fixtures, and faulty water 
heaters are frequent issues in this category.
8.	 Exterior items. Outside the home, doors, windows, and wall surfaces some-
times let the elements in. Degraded weather-stripping or poor caulking is of-
ten the culprit. 
9.	 Poor ventilation. Without proper ventilation, moisture can accumulate inside 
a home and cause rot, deterioration, mold growth, and other damage.
10.	 Miscellaneous items. This catch-all category includes problems found in the 
home’s interior, from lead-based paint and asbestos insulation to windows that 
stick rather than open smoothly.

by room, including all the structural components and systems listed ear-
lier in this chapter. He may use digital photos to illustrate his findings. The 
report often ends with a summary of the major findings.
Read the entire report. It won’t grip you like the latest bestseller, but it has 
more relevance to your day-to-day life. Write down questions that come 
to mind and make margin notes, then call your inspector. He can tell you 
which repairs you have to make and which are highest priority. But he 
won’t tell you whether or not you should buy the house—that’s your deci-
sion, and that’s why it’s important that you understand the report clearly.
After you talk with the inspector, contact contractors to get estimates of 
the high-priority repairs. You need these numbers when you sit down to 
negotiate with the seller (page 256).
Specialized Inspections
Aside from the general home inspection, you might want to contract for 
specialized inspections. If your home inspector recommends that some-
one take a closer look at, say, your electrical system, heed that advice. Your 
lender might require other inspections, such as those for termites or a sep-
tic system. Finally, you may want to get a special inspection for your own 
peace of mind.
Some sellers may pay for inspections to give the house an edge in the mar-
ket. After all, a black-and-white document that says the roof is sound and 
the house free of toxic mold makes the property more attractive. Even if 
a seller paid for an inspection, though, you it’s a good idea to contract for 
your own inspections. Think of them as second opinions to confirm previ-
ous inspectors’ findings.
Septic System
Many homes, particularly those in rural areas, use private septic systems, 
which take solid waste and wastewater that passes through the house’s 
plumbing, treat it, and release it into the ground around the system. Re-
placing or repairing a faulty septic system can cost tens of thousands of 
dollars, so you need to be sure that it works and that the current owner 
has properly maintained it. Inspecting a septic system is a dirty job, but be 
glad an inspection’s available—it might save you from costly emergency 
repairs later on.

Inspect the Property 
305
Your home inspector might point out signs indicating that you should get 
a professional septic system inspection. (You might notice these yourself 
as you tag along at the inspection.) Here are some warning signs:
•	 Clogged or slow drains
•	 Water seeping up through the ground over the septic tank
•	 A depression or sinkhole over the septic tank
•	 A nose-wrinkling odor
•	 The septic tank needs to be pumped out several times a year (ask the 
current owner about how often it needs pumping).
A septic tank inspector visually inspects the area around the tank and 
checks the condition of the tank cover. Next, he removes the cover and in-
spects the inside of the tank. He may run a dye test, pouring colorant into 
a toilet and flushing it through the system to find blockages and backups. 
Finally, he pumps out the tank and inspects it.
Wood-Destroying Pests
Termites and other creepy-crawlies that love to eat wood can cause sub-
stantial, hidden damage to a home. Although these inspections are often 
referred to as termite inspections, those aren’t the only bugs the inspec-
tor looks for. Most also probe for signs of dry rot, as well as a host of other 
wood-eating insects, such as carpenter ants, carpenter bees, and powder 
post beetles.
Because these critters often leave the surface of the wood intact while 
they eat away at the inside, you may not know you have a problem until 
your foot goes right through a stair or the vacuum cleaner bumps against 
the baseboard and splinters it. Wood-destroying insects cause billions of 
dollars a year in structural damage.
Some states require that new homeowners inspect their septic systems within a 
defined period. In Massachusetts, for example, new homeowners have two years. 
So the seller may have already done a septic system inspection before putting the 
home on the market. If so, ask to see the inspection report.

Chapter 12
306
Most lenders require that you 
inspect for wood-destroying 
pests. Even if the seller has 
had an inspection done, your 
lender may require a new 
one if it’s more than 30 days 
old. (It’s usually a good idea 
to confirm a seller’s inspec-
tion with one of your own, 
anyway.) In some areas, 
general home inspectors 
are also qualified to conduct 
pest inspections, but for the 
most thorough check, hire a 
professional pest inspector.
Health Hazards
You don’t want to move into a house only to get sick from toxic substances 
lurking inside. These specialized inspections focus on health hazards, such 
as toxic mold, asbestos, and radon gas.
Mold 
Although general home inspectors may notice and point out mold, it’s not 
part of their job to identify the kind and amount present. If you suspect the 
house may have mold (if it smells musty in places, for example, or you no-
tice mold or mildew growing on the walls, floor, or ceiling), get it checked 
out. In particular, you want to make sure that the home is free of molds of 
the genus Stachybotrys—what you’ve probably heard referred to as “toxic 
black mold.” This mold is responsible for a plethora of health problems, in-
cluding chronic fatigue; headaches; fever; rashes; nausea; irritation to the 
eyes, mouth, nose, and throat; sneezing; and coughing. Toxic black mold 
also causes sick building syndrome, a condition where people who live or 
work in a particular building suffer chronic discomfort and illness.
Mold isn’t always visible. It may grow inside air ducts, behind dropped ceilings, or 
inside walls, for example. If you’re concerned about mold, don’t rely on your senses 
to find it; get a mold inspection.
Termite-damaged wood

Inspect the Property 
307
A mold inspector tests for the 
presence, amount, and type of 
mold. He also checks to see how 
good a host for mold your house 
makes. He analyzes the air 
quality and checks for moisture 
(mold loves damp spots), water 
leaks, and humidity levels. Some 
inspectors even use fiber-optic 
cameras to check inside walls.
You can eradicate some mold, 
like the kind that typically grows 
on bathroom tiles, with bleach 
and a little effort. If you have a 
more pervasive problem—es-
pecially toxic black mold—you 
have to hire a mold-remediation 
company to get rid of it and 
ensure it won’t come back.
Asbestos
Asbestos is a mineral fiber widely used in the past to fireproof and insulate 
homes. The fibers can lodge in your airways and cause cancer and lung 
disease, so if you buy a home more than 40 years old, check for asbestos.
Asbestos was also used in roofing shingles, ceiling and floor tiles, cement 
products, some textured paints and coatings, and insulation for pipes and 
water heaters, too. When a product that contains asbestos deteriorates or 
gets disturbed (during renovations or remodeling, for example), it releases 
fibers into the air that can lodge in your lungs and cause medical prob-
lems. You definitely don’t want those fibers in your lungs.
If you suspect a home has asbestos (your general home inspector may 
point it out), consider a specialized asbestos inspection—especially in 
older homes you plan to remodel or update. The inspector will check for 
asbestos thoroughly and let you know if your house needs work. Pro-
fessional asbestos remediation companies can remove or contain the 
problem while complying with safety laws. But asbestos removal can be 
expensive, so get estimates and think carefully before you go forward 
with your purchase.

Radon 
Radon, a colorless, odorless radioactive gas, could lurk in any home—and 
the people who live there don’t even know it. Radon is the second leading 
cause of lung cancer deaths in the U.S. (after cigarette smoking). 
Radon occurs naturally in air, water, and soil, and it enters buildings through 
cracks and gaps in foundations, floors, and walls. To check for radon, in-
spectors leave an open charcoal canister or other collection device in the 
house for a couple of days, and then send it to a lab. If you want to check 
for radon (which is always a good idea), your home inspector may be able 
to do a radon test for an extra charge. Knowing that radon is a concern for 
potential buyers, many sellers test for radon, too—ask him if he’s done (or 
is willing to do) a radon test and share the results with you.
Radon is measured in picocuries per liter (pCi/L). Fresh, outdoor air has 
about 0.4 pCi/L of radon. Homes with radon levels 10 or more times that 
amount—4 pCi/L or higher—require work by a certified radon mitigation 
contractor to reduce the radon to safe levels. If your radon test indicates 
you’ll need to hire a radon mitigation contractor, get an estimate of the 
work needed to fix the home—and then negotiate with the seller about 
who will pay for it.
Other Specialized Inspections
You can have the condition of just about any house component inspected. 
The health of trees, the integrity of a swimming pool, or the energy ef-
ficiency of a guest house are all candidates for inspections. So if sick trees 
or a cracked pool are deal-breakers for you, include a contingency in your 
purchase agreement that requires an acceptable inspection of those items.
•	 Renovations. If you plan to do substantial renovations on your house, 
discuss your plans with an architect or general contractor to see if you 
can make the changes you want (load-bearing beams or renovation 
restrictions in historic districts may scuttle your plans).
•	 Lead-based paint. The federal government banned the use of lead-
based paint in 1978. If the home you’re buying was built before that 
year, get a lead-based paint inspection and flip to page 140 to read 
more about federal lead-based paint disclosure laws. 
The EPA offers state-by-state information about radon (including information 
about qualified radon mitigation contractors) and maps that show radon levels by 
county. Go to www.epa.gov/iaq/whereyoulive.html and select your state to learn 
more.

309
•	 Chimney. Home inspectors look at chimneys but don’t test them. A 
home’s chimney can hide problems, such as crumbling interior bricks, 
a missing or cracked flue liner, or a build-up of creosote (which can 
catch fire). Make sure the chimney is sound, especially if you’re buying 
an older home.
•	 Heating and air conditioning system. If your home inspector sus-
pects a problem with the furnace or the central air conditioner, bring 
in an HVAC (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) inspector. He 
can pinpoint the problem and estimate its repair.
•	 Electrical system. Older homes may have outdated electrical sys-
tems—your home inspector will let you know if yours is past its prime. 
To make sure an older electrical system complies with current building 
codes, your home inspector may recommend that you consult an elec-
trician for a detailed inspection. 
•	 Plumbing. A plumbing inspector checks pipes and fixtures for clogs, 
low water pressure, and other problems. You may be able to combine 
inspections for the plumbing, septic system, and private well to save 
money.
•	 Private well. For rural homes that rely on private wells for their water, 
well inspectors test the water quality, inspect the well’s construction, 
and check the water table’s depth (so you know if there’s sufficient wa-
ter to keep the well filled).
•	 Roof certification. If your home inspector recommends a roof inspec-
tion (or if your lender requires one), have a professional take a look. 
He’ll check the integrity of the roof and estimate how much longer 
it will last. The inspector will certify his findings—this certification is 
usually good for one to two years (some roofers will certify a roof for 
up to five years). 
Don’t try to remove lead-based paint yourself. Hire a certified lead-abatement 
professional.
Ask the seller to pay for a roof certification. It’s traditional in many areas of the 
country. Some sellers automatically get the roof certified when they put the home 
on the market.

•	 Foundation. Your home inspector might notice cracks, bulges, or other 
abnormalities in the foundation. If that happens, call in a foundation 
engineer to check things out and estimate repair costs.
•	 Swimming pool or spa. Specialized inspectors check for leaks and es-
timate the life expectancy of essential pool equipment, like the filter 
and heater. 
•	 Trees. A home inspector can tell you if a property’s trees are causing 
(or likely to cause) a problem for the house, such as a tree that’s too 
close to the home or a root system that may interfere with the septic 
system. If you want to know whether the trees are healthy, bring in a 
tree surgeon. 
•	 Energy audit. Older homes can be drafty and expensive to heat and 
cool compared to homes built with modern materials and techniques. 
An energy audit rates the energy efficiency of your home and recom-
mends improvements. The good news is you may be able to get a free 
(or low-cost) energy audit—many utility companies offer them. If not, 
go to the Energy Star website (a joint project of the Department of 
Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency) to find local Home 
Energy Raters qualified to do a professional energy audit. This web ad-
dress will get you there: www.tinyurl.com/ocf24b.
If Problems Turn Up
First of all, don’t panic. Any home that undergoes a professional inspec-
tion is going to reveal some issues. It’s normal for a home to need some 
maintenance. And it’s not necessary for a home to be in perfect condition 
when you buy it. In fact, it’s not the seller’s responsibility to sell you a per-
fect home. It’s up to you and the seller to reach an agreement on what’s 
acceptable for the sale to go through.
Your home inspection report is a tool for negotiating with the seller. Priori-
tize repairs—getting the roof certified is more important than replacing 
a damaged baseboard. Present the seller with a list of requested repairs, 
along with estimates of what they’ll cost. You can ask the seller to have 
repairs done before closing to reduce the purchase price or to give you a 
credit toward repairs at closing (page 330 explains these options in detail). 
The seller won’t be any happier than you are to hear about a need for re-
pairs, so expect some back-and-forth before you agree. If you can’t agree, 
you’ll have to decide whether to go ahead with the purchase anyway or 
invoke the home inspection contingency in your purchase agreement and 
walk away from the sale.

Frequently Asked Question
Buying a Home “As Is”
What if the terms of the sale specify that the house is being sold in “as is” condition? 
Do I still need a home inspection?
An “as is” home means that the seller is unwilling to negotiate a lower price or make 
repairs if the home has structural or other problems. It doesn’t mean that you give 
up your right to inspect the house, however. In fact, in an “as is” situation, it’s more 
important than ever to get a thorough home inspection.
Sellers can list a home “as is” for several reasons. Banks sell foreclosed homes and 
bank-owned homes (REOs; see page 127) in “as is” condition as a matter of course. 
A seller may lack funds to pay for repairs or simply not want the fuss and bother of 
overseeing them. Often, the seller has listed the house at a discount to compensate 
for his unwillingness to negotiate over the home’s condition.
A home that’s listed “as is” isn’t necessarily in bad shape. But it’s up to you to find 
out. If you make an offer on an “as is” home, include a home inspection contingency 
in the purchase agreement. That way, if you find out that repairs or renovations are 
more extensive than you planned on, you can get out of the deal with your earnest 
money intact.

A
ll the time and effort you’ve invested in your quest for a new home 
are about to pay off. The closing, sometimes called the settlement, 
is when your new home finally becomes yours. You sign a small 
mountain of mortgage-related documents and pay the down payment 
and closing costs, your lender advances the money for your loan, an at-
torney or escrow agent distributes the funds, and the seller transfers title 
to you. 
For a smooth closing, you need to do some prep work a day ahead of time. 
Of course, some glitch—a last-minute schedule conflict for the lender’s at-
torney, a contractor who hasn’t finished repairs—may delay the closing by 
a few days. There’s probably nothing to worry about it; a delay isn’t uncom-
mon (see “What If the Closing Gets Delayed?” below).
What happens at the closing depends partly on where you live. In some 
states, all of the relevant parties go individually to an escrow agent’s office 
to sign papers and pay funds; the agent holds these documents and funds 
in escrow, keeping them in reserve until all the documents are signed and 
all the money has been transferred, at which time escrow closes and the 
sale is complete. In other states, the parties meet simultaneously and close 
the deal together.
Whichever way the closing takes place, you’ll have a lot of papers to sign, 
and this chapter explains them in detail. You’ll also learn about the mo-
ment you’ve been waiting for: taking possession of your new home.

Countdown to Closing: 24 Hours  
to Go
In the day or two leading up to the closing, make sure you have everything 
in place for the big day. While your attorney or closing agent is busy do-
ing behind-the-scenes work—preparing paperwork, getting information 
from the other parties—you can do several things to make sure the closing 
goes smoothly:
•	 Take the final walkthrough. Page 286 tells you what to look for as 
you tour the house one last time. And page 290 tells you what to do if 
you discover a problem.
•	 Get the final amount for the closing costs. The Good Faith Estimate 
you got when you applied for a mortgage has some teeth to it—fed-
eral law prohibits lenders from raising many of the costs listed there; 
others may go up by a maximum of 10 percent (page 328 tells you 
what can and can’t change). So you should already have a good idea 
of your closing costs . But for the closing, you need to know the exact 
amount, including the fees you’ll pay the seller for things like prorated 
property taxes and heating oil left in the storage tank. Call your attor-
ney or loan originator and ask for a copy of your HUD-1 form, which, by 
law, lists all the fees you and the seller need to pay (page 325 tells you 
more about this form). Review the form to make sure it squares with 
your Good Faith Estimate. 
•	 Make arrangements to pay. At the closing, you pay the down pay-
ment for your house and the closing costs with a certified cashier’s 
check or by wire transfer. If you live in an escrow state, where an es-
crow agent holds funds and signed documents in trust until the trans-
action completes, you may be able to pay by personal check, but you 
have to submit your payment far enough in advance so that it clears 
Don’t take the final walkthrough too far in advance of the closing, even if the 
house is vacant. Lots of things can go wrong in just a few days—from a sewer 
backup to a break-in to a cold snap that freezes the pipes. The best time for the 
final walkthrough is after the seller has moved out, and no more than a day or 
two before closing. That day or two gives you time to negotiate compensation if 
you notice any problems. And it’s always a good idea to drive past the home on 
your way to the closing. If the seller failed to tow away the junk car he promised to 
remove from the driveway, you want to know that now.

well before escrow closes. (See page 319 to read more about how clos-
ings work in escrow states.) In non-escrow states, where the closing 
takes place during a single meeting, a personal check won’t work for 
these major costs. Your lender wants you to pay instantaneously, using 
a method that won’t take days to clear: usually with a certified bank 
check or cashier’s check or by wire transfer. 
If you pay with a certified or cashier’s check, get the check from your 
bank the day before the closing. Make it payable to yourself; you’ll sign 
it over to the closing agent or attorney when you close. If you pay by 
wire transfer, ask your bank ahead of time how it conducts wire trans-
fers. Banks have different policies related to this payment method; 
make sure you know your bank’s so you don’t hold up the closing.
•	 Wrap up any lingering issues. You and the seller should have met the 
obligations in your purchase agreement by now. But read over that 
document to make sure the seller’s met all the conditions of sale. Have 
you released all the contingencies? Has the seller taken care of all the 
agreed-upon repairs? 
•	 Review documents. Often, the loan originator or attorney doesn’t 
finalize the closing documents until the day of the closing. But ask 
them for a copy of any draft documents that are ready the day be-
fore. (If there are no draft documents, ask to see the standard forms 
used to prepare the documents.) Read over the documents, and ask 
about anything you don’t understand or that looks wrong. Better now 
than at the closing, when you may feel rushed or intimidated by all the 
people and paperwork.
•	 Make sure your real estate team has everything it needs from you. 
Get those i’s dotted and t’s crossed. Call your real estate agent, your at-
torney, and your mortgage broker or loan officer to make sure that no 
one is waiting for you to hand in any of your paperwork and that there 
are no lingering details for you to attend to.
If you transfer money into your bank account from another source (such as an 
account at a different bank or a check from mom and dad) for the down payment 
and closing costs, remember that banks often put a hold on large deposits to 
make sure they clear. Allow plenty of time for processing so the money’s available 
when you need it.

Chapter 13
316
•	 Gather what you need for the closing. Here’s a list of what you should 
bring:
—
— A government-issued photo ID. Bring your driver’s license or 
passport so you can prove who you are. One of the closing at-
tendees is a notary public, a state-appointed public servant who 
verifies the authenticity of signatures. This notary will witness your 
signature.
—
— A certified bank or cashier’s check. This check pays your down 
payment and closing costs. (Of course, if you plan to wire the money 
at closing, skip the check.)
—
— Your checkbook. Even though you pay the big costs with a certi-
fied or cashier’s check or a wire transfer, you may have to pay for 
small adjustments—like increased homeowners’ association fees 
or the final volume of heating fuel in the storage tank—so bring 
your personal checkbook. You might even walk out of the closing 
with a couple of checks made out to you.
—
— Your Good Faith Estimate. When you applied for your loan, the 
lender gave you a Good Faith Estimate detailing the terms of your 
loan and estimating closing costs. You’ll want to compare the GFE 
with the closing costs listed on your HUD-1 form. 
—
— Your mortgage commitment letter. This letter formally states the 
amount and the terms of your mortgage. Use it to correct any dis-
crepancies in the loan documents.
—
— Your rate lock letter. If you locked in your interest rate (page 204 
tells you why you should), bring the letter that confirms that rate. 
If the interest rate on the loan papers is higher than your locked-in 
rate, you have proof of the correct rate. 
—
— Proof of homeowner’s insurance. Bring along the binder you 
got from your insurance agent when you bought homeowner’s 
insurance, along with a receipt that shows you paid the first 
year’s premium.
—
— Home inspection reports. Bring the general report and any 
special-inspection reports (page 304).
—
— A calculator. If you want to double-check the math on your HUD-1 
form before you sign it, a calculator comes in handy.
—
— Anything else the lender requires. All closings are different. Call 
your bank representative, closing agent, or attorney and run down 
the list of what you intend to bring and ask if you forgot anything.

Take the day of the closing off from work—most closings take no more 
than an hour or two, but it’s wise to be prepared for delays (page 330 lists 
some of the things that can slow down a closing). And get a good night’s 
sleep beforehand. You want to be sharp for the meeting.
What If the Closing Gets Delayed?
Robert Burns, the Scottish poet who commented that “the best laid 
schemes of mice and men” often go wrong, could have been a real estate 
agent. No matter how carefully you plan, things can happen that delay—
or even prevent—a closing. Problems may arise, for example, if the mort-
gage underwriter (page 162) requires clarification of or extra documenta-
tion for something in your loan application. It can take time to gather the 
information, submit it to the underwriter, and wait for a response. Delays 
like this can be harrowing. Submit the requested information and try not 
to get too nervous. Remember that, even though lenders want to close 
files as efficiently and quickly as circumstances allow, delays do happen. 
Your mortgage broker or loan officer can give you the reason for a delay, 
but here are some common causes:
•	 Even if you’re preapproved for a loan, the lender will check your credit 
report again. Any new debt or credit problems that appear on your 
report can slow or preclude final approval.
•	 Mistakes in your credit report can also cause delays—that’s why it’s a 
good idea to find and correct them before you apply for a mortgage 
(see page 48). A mistake can still pop up in your updated report, but 
you’ve taken care of the old ones.
•	 The lender may ask for updated bank statements or other financial 
documents. 
•	 Your job situation changes. Lenders look for stable employment. If you 
change your job, they may want to look more closely at your employ-
ment history and current job status.
•	 The lender’s appraisal comes in low. Page 223 tells you what to do if 
that happens. 
•	 The mortgage underwriter may want a second appraisal to confirm 
the first. If the second-look appraisal is lower than the first one, the 
underwriter may refuse the loan.
•	 The title search turns up a defect (page 269). The seller will have to 
clear it before you can close.

Chapter 13
318
•	 Even if the title search comes up clear, lenders will check it again be-
fore closing. Any interim liens or judgments on the home’s title can 
delay or prevent the sale.
•	 You or the seller gets married or divorced. A change in marital status 
can complicate everything from your loan application to the way you 
elect to hold title to the house (see page 270) to whether the seller still 
has the right to sell the home.
•	 The seller fails to make repairs. You may (and should, actually) decide 
to delay the closing until the seller makes agreed-upon repairs to your 
satisfaction.
•	 The seller requests to stay in the house after the closing. Imagine the 
seller comes to you a few days before closing and says, “I know we’re 
closing on Thursday, but the moving company can’t come until next 
Monday. You don’t mind if I stay in the house through the weekend, do 
you?” If you don’t want the seller living in the house after it’s yours, you 
may end up delaying the closing until the seller moves out. 
•	 You fail to supply complete insurance information. The bank will insist 
that you have all the required policies in hand before loaning you any 
money. 
•	 Your mortgage preapproval commitment has expired—this may mean 
you have to apply for a mortgage starting from square one again.
If an event delays your closing, keep an eye on any deadlines in your pur-
chase agreement and get an extension, signed by you and the seller. Also, 
check the expiration date in the bank’s mortgage commitment letter. A 
delay in closing might void your locked-in mortgage rate. In that case, con-
tact your mortgage broker or loan officer.
If you’re engaged to be married and you want to buy a home, talk to a real estate 
agent, loan officer, and attorney to find out whether you should buy before or after 
you tie the knot.
Because delays happen, it’s a good idea to give yourself a few days’ breathing 
room between the closing and the day you plan to move in. If you schedule things 
too tightly, you may have to reschedule the move or stay in a hotel for a few days.

What Happens at a Closing
Finally, you wake up one morning and the day of your closing has dawned. 
Whether you feel confident or a little nervous, it helps to know what to 
expect. Closing customs differ by geographic area. In addition to whether 
everyone involved signs papers individually or around a table, the location 
of the closing depends in part on local tradition (as well as what’s most 
convenient for the parties involved). Most likely, your attorney or the title 
or escrow company will host the closing. But a closing can also take place 
at the bank, your builder’s sales office (for new construction), the office of 
the lender’s attorney, and sometimes even at the real estate agency.
This section explains what to expect at the closing, taking into account 
differences between regions. Whatever the local details and customs, the 
final result is the same: You become a homeowner. 
Closing in an Escrow State
Some states—many of them in the west, including California, Oregon, Ne-
vada, and Arizona—are escrow states, where you, the seller, and the lender 
choose an escrow company or agent to act as a neutral party to coordinate 
the house’s sale. You (along with the seller and the lender) provide the es-
crow agent with mutually agreed-upon instructions for the transaction. 
The escrow agent makes sure that all the instructions’ stipulations and 
conditions, as well as the funds and fees for the sale, have cleared before 
completing the sale.
In the days and weeks leading up to closing, the escrow agent collects the 
closing documents and money from all parties and holds them in escrow 
until the closing. This means that the escrow agent holds all the money 
and signed documents in trust until the sale instructions are complete—
the seller may sign a document transferring title, for example, but the ac-
tual transfer won’t happen until all of the necessary documents and funds 
are in the escrow agent’s hands. Holding money and documents in escrow 
means that you and the seller each meet with the escrow agent, usually 
separately, to sign the necessary documents. You may make several trips 
to the escrow agent’s office to take care of everything you need to do.
Here are some of the items escrow agents collect and hold in escrow:
•	 A fully executed purchase agreement, including releases or waivers of 
contingencies
•	 Your earnest money deposit
•	 Escrow instructions signed by you and the seller
•	 A lender-approved appraisal

Chapter 13
320
•	 The home-inspection report or waiver
•	 The pest-inspection report (if required)
•	 The roof certification (if required)
•	 The home warranty (if applicable)
•	 Proof that the seller has made agreed-upon repairs
•	 A preliminary title insurance policy
•	 Proof you acquired homeowner’s insurance
•	 Your lender’s loan approval letter
•	 Your final walkthrough inspection report or waiver
•	 The home’s deposit or the balance of your down payment
•	 Closing costs
•	 Your signature on all loan documents
•	 Funds that go from your lender to the appropriate parties (the seller, 
the seller’s lender, real estate agents, and so on)
•	 Any agreed-upon funds that go from the seller to you
•	 The seller’s signed and notarized deed conveying title to you
When the escrow agent has everything she needs, she conducts the clos-
ing: She disburses funds, transfers ownership of the property, and finalizes 
the sale. This is called “closing escrow.” You may have to wait a couple of 
days after you sign the papers and hand over your money before escrow 
closes. When everything is final, the escrow agent notifies all parties—and 
you get to pick up the keys to your new home.
Closing in a Non-Escrow State 
If you live in a non-escrow state (sometimes called a title state), a real estate 
attorney takes care of the closing. Title states include Florida, New York, 
Pennsylvania, Georgia, and many others in the eastern U.S. In such states, 
your attorney or lender sets a time and place for the closing. You and the 
seller get together with the other players (such as attorneys, agents, and 
the lender’s representative) to sign papers, distribute funds, and transfer 
the property. 
Closing practices vary from one escrow state to another and sometimes from one 
county to another. To get a sense of how escrow closings in your area work, ask 
your real estate agent what a typical closing is like.

Close the Deal
321
You may find most of your real estate team at the closing, along with some 
players from the seller’s side. Some or all of these people will attend:
•	 You. You might want to give your writing hand a couple of good work-
outs ahead of time, because you’ll be signing a lot of papers.
•	 Your real estate agent. Your buyer’s agent will be at your side, to en-
courage you, congratulate you—and pick up her share of the commis-
sion check.
•	 Your attorney. If you have any questions about any of the papers 
you’re signing, your attorney should be there to answer them. 
•	 The seller. Sometimes the seller’s attorney or other authorized person 
may act on the seller’s behalf—if, for example, the seller has already 
moved out of state. But usually the seller wants to attend the closing to 
make sure everything goes smoothly—and, of course, to collect what-
ever funds he’s due after he pays his mortgage and other fees.
•	 The seller’s real estate agent. Like your agent, the listing agent at-
tends the closing primarily to collect his commission check, but he 
also offers his client support and guidance.
•	 The seller’s attorney. If the seller has an attorney, that attorney may 
attend the closing to keep an eye on the proceedings and answer any 
questions the seller has.
What if you can’t attend the closing? You should make every effort to be there—af-
ter all, it’s your name on all those legal documents—but if you absolutely cannot 
make it, you can grant your real estate lawyer power of attorney to act on your 
behalf in this transaction. If you do, make sure it includes a clear expiration date, 
usually a few days after the closing.
You can save some attorney’s fees by not requiring your attorney to attend the 
closing. If you take that route, though, make sure your attorney reviews and okays 
all the documents you’ll be signing a day in advance.
The seller may arrive at the closing later than you do, because there are fewer 
papers for him to sign. You have to sign a stack of documents related to your mort-
gage; the seller mostly signs documents related to the transfer of the property. 
While your part of the closing can easily take an hour or two, the seller only needs 
to be there for about half an hour.

Chapter 13
322
•	 Lender’s representative. The bank may send a representative, usually 
your loan officer or the bank’s attorney. Often, though, someone at the 
bank prepares all the documents and sends them directly to the clos-
ing agent, who contacts the bank if any questions come up. 
•	 Notary public. This person witnesses and certifies the participants’ 
signatures.
That’s an awfully crowded room! Not everyone on the list attends every 
closing, but it gives you an idea of the players required to close a sale.
A Mountain of Paperwork: What It 
All Means
You’ve got two main responsibilities at the closing: to hand over money 
and to sign papers. You might feel a bit intimidated when you see the stack 
of papers. Don’t worry, you’ll get through them all. As the attorney or es-
crow agent passes each document to you, she’ll explain what it means. If 
you have any questions, ask; the only question you’re likely to regret is the 
one you don’t ask. 
If you got your HUD-1 and other draft documents a day in advance, you’ve 
had time to look them over and note any questions you have. But don’t 
feel rushed. You have the right to read each document before you sign it. 
Don’t sign anything you don’t understand. Insist on a clear explanation, 
and make sure you’re comfortable with what you sign.
The documents you sign depend on your state, your purchase agreement, 
and the terms of your transaction. But here’s a description of some:
•	 Final truth-in-lending disclosure statement. When you applied for a 
mortgage, you received an initial version of this statement (page 214). 
Now that the bank has approved your loan, you get the final version, 
called the Regulation Z form. It details your payments, the loan’s inter-
est rate (page 153), and how much you’ll pay over the lifetime of the 
loan. It also shows any modifications made to your rate for points you 
bought when you took out your mortgage. Take the time to read this 
form and confirm that everything is correct. 
One person typically acts as the closing agent and oversees the proceedings, mak-
ing sure all relevant parties sign all necessary documents and disbursing the funds. 
The closing agent is usually an attorney: yours or the lender’s.

Close the Deal
323
•	 HUD-1 settlement statement. This federal form, which you and the 
seller both sign, details the costs related to the sale. It spells out who 
pays how much to whom. The expenses listed include not only the 
cost of the property, but other costs as well, like property taxes and 
personal property included with the sale. Page 325 gives you an over-
view of what’s on a HUD-1 form.
•	 Mortgage note. This document, also called a promissory note because 
it records your promise to repay your mortgage, states the amount 
you borrowed and the terms of the loan. It also spells out the lender’s 
options if you fail to make payments. 
•	 Mortgage (called a deed of trust or trust deed in some areas). This 
document secures your mortgage note—it gives your lender a claim 
against your house if you don’t live up to the terms of the mortgage 
note. (Page 153 explains the difference between a mortgage and a 
deed of trust.)
•	 Monthly payment letter. This letter breaks down your monthly pay-
ments for the first year of your loan, explaining how much money 
you’ll pay each in principal and interest. It also may say how much of 
your payment goes into escrow for taxes and insurance (including PMI 
if you have mortgage insurance).
•	 Initial escrow statement. This document (which may supplement the 
monthly payment letter) itemizes the part of your monthly PITI (prin-
cipal, interest, taxes, and insurance) payments that go into an escrow 
account, breaking down how much goes toward taxes, how much to-
ward homeowner’s insurance, how much toward PMI, and so on. If you 
have to pay a lump sum in the first year to “cushion” your escrow ac-
count, it states that amount, too.
By law, you have the right to review your completed HUD-1 form 24 hours before 
the closing. In practice, though, many people see this document for the first time 
at the closing itself. Let your attorney or closing agent know that you want your 
HUD-1 the day before the closing. When you get it, compare it to your Good Faith 
Estimate (page 215) to search for inconsistencies. That way, you can fix mistakes 
and resolve problems before the closing.
The initial escrow statement covers only the first 12 months of your loan. Because 
the cost of taxes and insurance tend to increase with time, you should expect this 
portion of your monthly PITI payments to grow from year to year.

Chapter 13
324
•	 Mortgage servicing disclosure statement. This document simply 
tells you whether your lender intends to service your loan itself or sell 
it to another lender on the secondary market. If your original lender 
transfers your loan to someone else, the second lender has to honor 
the terms of your loan.
•	 Title insurance commitment. This is a promise that the insurance 
company will issue you a homeowner’s policy. You get the actual policy 
in the mail a few weeks after the closing.
•	 Deed. This document transfers the home’s title from the seller to you 
(read more about that on page 267). The deed should contain an accu-
rate description of the property and must be signed according to your 
local state laws. Check to make sure that your name is spelled right 
and that it describes the kind of title you’ve chosen (see page 270 for 
your options). After the closing agent records the deed with your local 
government’s property recording office, she’ll send it to you. Keep it 
somewhere secure, like a bank safe deposit box.
•	 Bill of sale. Just as a deed transfers ownership of the house and 
grounds to you, the bill of sale gives you ownership of any personal 
property that conveys with the home, such as appliances, drapes, fire-
place accessories, and so on.
•	 Affidavit of title. By signing this document, the seller swears under 
oath that he knows of no title defects or liens against the property. The 
specific wording of the affidavit varies by state, but it typically includes:
—
— The seller’s name and address
—
— A statement that the seller actually owns the property
—
— A statement that the seller hasn’t sold (or agreed to sell) the prop-
erty to another buyer
—
— A statement that no liens exist against the property
—
— A statement that no assessments exist against the property
—
— A statement that the seller hasn’t declared bankruptcy
A signed affidavit of title offers you some protection and legal recourse 
if a title defect or lien turns up later.
•	 American Land Title Association (ALTA) statement. Like the affida-
vit of title, the ALTA statement ensures that the property’s title is clear 
and that the property is free of easements, encumbrances, and liens. 
Both you and the seller sign the ALTA statement. You need this docu-
ment to buy title insurance.

•	 Home warranty. If the home comes with a warranty (page 279)—
whether from the builder or a home-warranty company—you get the 
warranty at the closing.
•	 Homeowners’ or condominium association documents. If the 
home you’re buying is part of a homeowners’ or condominium asso-
ciation (page 23), you have additional documents to sign, including 
covenants, conditions, restrictions, and the association’s by-laws. 
•	 Certificate of occupancy. If the house you’re buying is new construc-
tion, this document certifies that the building meets building codes 
and is safe to occupy. Your local government issues the certificate of 
occupancy.
At the end of the closing, you get a complete set of documents for your 
records (except for the deed; you get that after the closing agent records 
it with your local government). Hang on to the paperwork, and store it in a 
safe place, such as a safe deposit box at the bank. 
Your HUD-1 Form
One of the most important documents you get at the closing is the HUD-1 
form, which itemizes all of the fees and charges paid by you and the seller 
in the transaction. Your lender fills out the HUD-1. Knowing what’s on it 
can help you check it over and make sure it has no costly mistakes (go to 
this book’s Missing CD at www.missingmanuals.com/cds/ to follow along 
with the discussion of HUD forms below). 
Basic Information
At the top of the HUD-1 form’s first page, you’ll see basic information about 
the sale: type of loan; the property location; names and addresses of you, 
the seller, and the person who’s conducting the closing; the closing’s date 
and location.
Save back-up copies of your documents by running them through a scanner and 
emailing the files to yourself. Keeping copies in your webmail account or your 
Internet service provider’s email server gives you a secure backup and easy access 
to your paperwork if you need to review anything.

Summaries of Borrower’s and Seller’s 
Transactions 
Sections J and K are side-by-side columns—your column is on the left and 
the seller’s is on the right—that detail who pays what in the transaction:
•	 Gross Amount Due From Borrower (lines 100–120) takes into ac-
count the purchase price, the price of personal property (like appli-
ances) included in the sale, your closing costs (taken from line 1400 on 
page 2), prorated taxes, and other charges. 
•	 Gross Amount Due To Seller (lines 400–420) itemizes the funds that 
go to the seller. Most of these amounts (sale price, personal property) 
match what’s in the borrower’s column.
•	 Amounts Paid By or in Behalf of Borrower (lines 200–220) lists your 
earnest money deposit and the amount you’re borrowing, along with 
adjustments for taxes and other charges that the seller hasn’t paid. (If, 
for example, the seller pays property taxes quarterly and hasn’t yet 
paid this quarter’s bill, there’s an adjustment here for the seller’s por-
tion of that bill.)
•	 Reductions in Amount Due to Seller (lines 500–520) itemizes charg-
es that the seller pays out of proceeds of the sale: settlement charges, 
payoff of her current mortgage, and so on.
•	 Cash at Settlement From/To Borrower (lines 300–303) subtracts the 
money you’ve paid (and any that’s being paid on your behalf) from 
the money you owe to come up with the amount you need to pay 
out of pocket: the down payment plus closing costs. This amount cor-
responds to the funds your closing agent asked you to bring to the 
closing as a bank check or wire transfer.
•	 Cash at Settlement To/From Seller (lines 600–603) subtracts what 
the seller owes from what you’re paying the seller to show how much 
cash she gains from the sale. In some cases (in a short sale, for exam-
ple), the seller may end up owing money if your payments don’t cover 
everything the seller owes.

327
Settlement Charges
This part, called Section L, is the longest section of the HUD-1 form and 
takes up the entire second page. It details all costs related to the closing 
and specifies whether you or the seller pays each. Here’s what it lists:
•	 Total Real Estate Broker Fees (lines 700–704) is about the real estate 
agents’ commissions. It specifies the amount paid to each agent in-
volved in the sale. The seller usually pays these commissions, but if you 
hired a buyer’s agent, you may pay that agent directly.    
•	 Items Payable in Connection with Loan (lines 800–811) lists what 
the lender is charging you for processing your mortgage. Each charge 
corresponds to a line from your Good Faith Estimate, and each cor-
responding line is labeled so you can easily compare the GFE to the 
charges listed here. They should match up—federal law prohibits lend-
ers from increasing any of the fees listed here from what’s on your GFE.
•	 Items Required by Lender to Be Paid in Advance (lines 900–904) 
itemizes charges that you must prepay, like interest that accrues be-
tween now and the date your first mortgage payment is due. Other 
prepaid charges may include private mortgage insurance (if your 
down payment is less than 20 percent) and homeowners insurance 
and property taxes (if you’re paying those into escrow).
•	 Reserves Deposited with Lender (lines 1000–1007) details the es-
crow “cushion” you must pay in advance if you’re paying taxes and 
insurance into an escrow account. The lender determines how big a 
cushion it requires—the amount may be six months’ or a year’s worth 
of charges—and tells you how much here. This section applies to PMI, 
other insurance, and property taxes.  
•	 Title Charges (lines 1100–1111) gives charges related to transferring 
the title from the seller to you, including the title search and title insur-
ance policies. The buyer usually pays the fees in this section.
•	 Government Recording and Transfer Charges (lines 1200–1206) 
gives you a list of the taxes and fees your state and local governments 
charge in relation to the sale: transfer tax, fees for recording the mort-
gage and the deed, city, county, and tax stamps, and so on. Taxes vary 
by state and municipality. The buyer normally pays these charges.  

Chapter 13
328
•	 Additional Settlement Charges (lines 1300–1305) includes miscella-
neous charges related to the sale, such as a survey, home inspection, 
pest inspection, home warranty, and any other charges for third-party 
services. These charges are usually split by you and the seller, accord-
ing to what you agreed on previously.
•	 Total Settlement Charges (line 1400) gives a total for all closing costs 
you pay and all that the seller pays. These totals go on line 103 (for you) 
and line 502 (for the seller) to show how closing costs affect the bot-
tom line for both parties.
Comparison of Good Faith Estimate and  
HUD-1 Charges
The top half of page 3 is set up to make it easy for you to compare what 
the lender told you about closing costs on your Good Faith Estimate with 
what you’re actually paying at the closing. In three tables, it lays out, side 
by side, the numbers from your GFE with the numbers on the HUD-1 in 
these categories:
•	 Charges That Cannot Increase. This section shows what the lender 
is charging you for making the loan, any points you’ve agreed to pay 
(page 157), and transfer taxes. The numbers in the Good Faith Estimate 
and HUD-1 columns should match exactly.
•	 Charges That in Total Cannot Increase More Than 10%. This section 
lists government recording charges and any third-party services that 
the lender required and for which the lender selected the service pro-
vider, such as title insurance and the appraisal. Whip out your calcula-
tor to make sure that the amounts in the HUD-1 column are no more 
than 10 percent greater than the amounts in the Good Faith Estimate 
column.
Some fees, such as the home inspection fee, may be marked “POC,” which means 
“paid outside closing.” You’ve already paid these fees and don’t have to pay them 
again now. They appear on the HUD-1 because it lists all costs related to the clos-
ing, whether you’ve already paid them or not.

Close the Deal
329
•	 Charges That Can Change. Here you’ll find third-party services that 
you shopped for yourself, rather than going with the lender’s recom-
mendation. This section might include your home inspection or title 
insurance (if the lender let you shop for the title insurer yourself). It 
also includes the lender’s original estimate of your escrow cushion 
and daily interest that you owe between now and your first scheduled 
payment—the closing date wasn’t definite when the lender prepared 
the GFE, so it’s impossible to predict these charges precisely on that 
estimate.   
Loan Terms
This section is the same as the “Summary of your loan” section of your 
Good Faith Estimate. Compare it line by line to your GFE to make sure that 
everything is the same. 
Up to Speed
Co-op Closings
When you buy a co-op, you don’t buy a piece of real estate, you buy shares in a 
corporation that owns the property. So co-op closings are a little different from real-
property closings. Proof of co-op ownership is a stock certificate, and the current 
owner’s lender holds his certificate as security against his mortgage. When you buy 
shares in a co-op, the co-op destroys the seller’s old stock certificate, and you get a 
shiny new one that says you’re now the proud owner of the shares.
When you close on a co-op, you meet with the seller (sometimes) and a representa-
tive of the seller’s lender at the office of the co-op’s attorney. Your lender’s represen-
tative also attends, as do the real estate agents and attorneys for both sides of the 
sale. Co-op closings include these documents:
•	 Your stock certificate, which specifies how many shares of the co-op corpora-
tion you own.
•	 Your proprietary lease, which gives you the right to occupy a particular 
apartment
•	 A recognition agreement, signed by you, the lender, and a co-op corporation 
representative, in which the co-op promises not to cancel the stock or the lease 
or to allow additional financing without the lender’s consent.
•	 A UCC-1 form, which provides public notice of the lender’s lien on your co-op 
shares.
Unlike the sale of a house, where a new deed records the title transfer in public 
records, a co-op sale requires that you file a UCC-1 form to publicly declare you’ve 
borrowed money against shares in an incorporated entity (the co-op). Your lender 
will also require that you hand over the original stock certificate and a copy (with 
original signatures) of your proprietary lease.

Chapter 13

What If Something Goes Wrong?
By far, the majority of closings go smoothly. If you’re a first-time home-
buyer, you may be surprised at how easily the process flows and how non-
chalant everyone seems. The pros in the room have done this many times 
before, and they’re as eager as you are to close the deal. If you laid the 
groundwork properly—you met your obligations, got your questions an-
swered, and gathered everything you needed for the closing—you’ll be in 
good shape.
Even so, problems can and do arise. One of the most common is a lender 
who doesn’t send over all the necessary documents or delays transferring 
funds to the closing agent. If the closing agent discovers that documents 
are missing, she’ll contact the lender’s office and ask someone there to fax 
them over. If the lender is slow to wire the money, you may have to wait for 
funds. Such problems usually result from tardiness, oversight, or a techni-
cal glitch, not from any problem with your loan. But it can be annoying to 
wait for the lender to get its act together.
There can be more serious problems with loan documents as well, how-
ever. You may find that the interest rate isn’t what you expected or that the 
costs listed don’t match your Good Faith Estimate. Snafus like this may take 
a day—or several—to clear up.
Last-minute title problems sometimes crop up, too. A lien or claim that didn’t 
come up in the initial title search may become known at the closing. Or you 
may find that the seller hasn’t paid back property taxes. Your lender won’t 
want to proceed (and neither should you) until you settle these issues.
If you locked in your interest rate after your GFE expired, the loan terms here may 
be different from the GFE. Compare them to your rate lock letter instead.
A closing that is complete except for the final act of disbursing funds and deliver-
ing documents is called a dry closing. In a dry closing, you’ve fulfilled all your ob-
ligations, signed all the papers, and paid the promised deposit and other monies, 
but the funds from your lender haven’t arrived. If all parties agree, the closing takes 
place anyway—but it’s not final until the funds arrive from the lender and the clos-
ing agent distributes them, usually later that day or the following day.

Close the Deal
331
Sometimes, the closing agent may make a mistake and tell you the wrong 
amount of money to bring to the closing. If she asked for too much, no 
problem—you get the excess back. But if she asked for too little, every-
thing comes to a grinding halt until you make up the difference. If it’s for a 
small amount, you can probably pay the difference with a personal check 
(good thing you brought your checkbook!). If it’s substantial, though—say, 
more than a few hundred dollars—you have to have the extra funds wired 
or go out and get a bank check or cash. 
Issues that come up in your final walkthrough can also lengthen the clos-
ing. For example, maybe the seller has moved out but left the garage 
crammed with junk. Make sure you resolve such problems before the sale 
is final—in this case, for example, you could have the seller write you a 
check to have his junk hauled away—but dealing with issues like these at 
the closing takes time.
Usually, you can resolve closing problems the same day. Sometimes, you 
have to go through with a dry closing or reschedule the closing a day or 
two later. Most of the time, though, once you and the seller have released 
all contingencies, the escrow agent has fulfilled all of the escrow instruc-
tions , and the underwriter signs off on your loan, you’re good to go. It’s 
rare for closing-day problems to kill a sale.
After the Closing
All of the papers have been signed and all of the funds distributed. But 
the transaction isn’t quite over yet. You might be ready to shout, “I’m a 
homeowner!” from the rooftops, but that’s not how the world finds out 
that you now own a home.
To make everything official, your closing agent or attorney must record the 
deed in your local property records office. In some areas, the closing agent 
can record the deed electronically, which takes just a few minutes. In other 
areas, someone—the closing agent, an assistant, or a courier—goes to the 
records office to record the deed. Especially in the case of an in-person 
recording, it may take a day or so to file the paperwork. Once your local 
government has the new deed on record, you’re done. The home is yours. 
Now you can shout from the rooftops.
You’ll receive the deed and your title insurance policy several weeks after the 
closing. Be sure to put them in the same safe place you keep the other documents 
related to the purchase of your home.

Chapter 13
332
Even though the home is yours, depending on where you live, you may 
not be able to move in right away. Your purchase agreement probably has 
a clause in it defining when you can take possession. In most cases, that’s 
immediately after the closing—the seller drops the keys in your hand, and 
you can start moving in. 
But in some states, you may not be able to take possession right away. 
Massachusetts, for example, makes buyers wait until the deed has been 
recorded before taking possession—which may happen anywhere from 
an hour to a full day after the closing. New York sellers have a legal right to 
stay in their just-sold home for up to a week if they deposit funds in escrow 
to guarantee that they’ll move out within that time. Make sure you know 
the law and how it affects your move-in date.
And you may have made special arrangements to let the seller stay in the 
home a little longer if, for example, he closes on his new house after you 
buy yours. In a situation like that, you and the seller work out the details 
ahead of time—how long the seller may stay and how much rent the seller 
pays you (make sure you get the details in writing).
When you can take possession may also be affected by the kind of market 
you buy in:
•	 In a buyer’s market, buyers typically insist on immediate possession. 
Sellers who can’t provide a move-in-ready home at the closing may 
find it harder to sell their home.
•	 In a seller’s market, the roles are reversed. Buyers are more likely to 
agree to a seller’s demand to stay in the home for a period of time after 
the closing. In a situation where multiple buyers compete for the same 
house, buyers might sweeten the deal by allowing the seller to remain 
in the home at a very low rent (or even rent-free) for a week or more 
after the closing.
•	 In a neutral market, possession usually happens immediately or soon 
after closing.
Your new homeowners liability policy protects you if the seller injures herself while 
living in your newly purchased home.

Close the Deal
333
Taking possession means that you finally get the keys to your new home. 
And don’t forget items like remote garage door openers and owner’s man-
uals and warranties for appliances, the furnace, and the central air condi-
tioner. It’s all yours now.
Whenever you take possession, make sure that your purchase agreement (page 
250) states—in clear, black-and-white terms—when the seller will vacate the 
house. This doesn’t have to be tied to a certain date. In fact, the best phrasing is 
something like “on closing” or “two days after closing.” This gives both parties flex-
ibility if the closing date changes. 
You did a lot of work and waited a long time to get those keys. But change the 
locks as soon as possible. This doesn’t mean you don’t trust the seller (although 
you might not). It’s just common sense. You never know who might have a spare 
key that the seller didn’t collect.
