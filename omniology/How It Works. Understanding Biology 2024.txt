Welcome
iology is the branch of 
science that explores all 
living organisms and the 
processes that create and 
govern them. It studies the
animal kingdom, humans, 
plant life (including fungi and moulds) and the 
tiny world of microbiology, including micro­
organisms like bacteria and viruses, and the 
cells that make up the building blocks of all 
living things. In this book, from the makers 
of How It Works, you’ll discover more about 
these branches of biology and some of their 
key processes, like evolution, hormones, germ 
theory and photosynthesis, along with many 
other fascinating aspects of the study of life.

or around 3.7 billion years, 
Flife has followed a roadmap 
of evolution. The journey 
to modern-day life and the 
more than 2.16 million known 
species that reside on Earth has 
been guided by several different evolutionary 
pathways. The naturalist known as ‘the father 
of evolution’, Charles Darwin, first proposed 
the theory of evolution by natural selection 
after he jumped aboard the HMS Beagle in 
1831 and sailed around the world for five 
years. On his travels, he discovered diverse 
wildlife, observing that they had anatomy 
specially adapted to their environments. He 
concluded that a species’ survival depends on 
traits that suit its environment. This survival- 
of-the-fittest approach means that only animals 
with beneficial characteristics can continue to 
reproduce and pass them onto their offspring. 
Darwin proposed that through forces of 
evolution, an ancestral family tree formed 
below modern-day species, leading to a 
common ancestor at its roots.
Forces of evolution are varied and
I specific to an ecology niche. For many, 
§ J | evolution is driven by sexual selection, 
ML whereby qualities in potential mates - 
such as plumage vibrancy or big antlers 
- are chosen by a partner to successfully 
reproduce. For others, natural selection occurs 
when an aspect of a species’ environment is 
altered, such as by climatic change, and they 
are forced to adapt or die. Those that can 
change go on to reproduce, leading to some 
anatomical and behavioural differences over 
millennia, creating new species along the way. 
Today scientists refer to the creation of a new 
species as divergent evolution, where a new 
species separates from a common ancestor. 
Building on the work of Darwin, the term 
‘divergent evolution’ was first introduced 
by evolutionist John Thomas Gulick in 1890. 
As the name suggests, divergent evolution 
occurs when a subgroup within a species 
diverges anatomically from the rest of the 
species, with these genes spreading until a new 
distinct species emerges. All life on Earth has 
undergone divergent evolution from a distant 
common ancestor, branching off into new 
families that form the tree of life.
For example, humans share more than 97 
per cent of their DNA with the other great 
ape species on Earth: orangutans, gorillas 
and chimpanzees. Evolving from a common

ancestor more than 25 million years ago, the 
great apes have diverged from their common 
lineage to produce an unknown number 
of now-extinct species that have paved the 
way for modern-day animals. Although they 
share a common ancestor, each ape has 
evolved distinctly different characteristics that 
have benefited them in their environment 
but have ultimately led to development 
of each individual ape species.
Divergent evolution occurs over long periods, 
with some studies suggesting that it generally 
takes around 2 million years for a new species
evolved separately, 
resulting in wings despite 
having different lineages
Birds and bats both
Honey badgers evolved thick skin to evade the 
sting of a bee, but bees co-evolved a signalling 
system to attack badgers en masse
to emerge. However, not all animals are willing 
to wait that long, instead rapidly evolving 
several new species through a process known 
as adaptive radiation. One of Darwin’s most 
notable observations involved a group of 
finches that lived throughout the Galapagos 
Islands. Across the different islands, Darwin 
observed that among the related finches, beak 
size and shape varied depending on what food 
they ate. He concluded that with each new 
generation, those that were better equipped 
to find food were able to survive - a concept 
that formed the basis for his famous theory on 
natural selection.
Similarly, in Hawaii, a group of birds called 
honeycreepers have undergone adaptive 
radiation to produce a diverse family of birds 
with beaks specialised for their food. Some 
boast big, long beaks to probe underneath bark 
to find insects, while others developed stout 
robust beaks for cracking seeds and picking 
berries. Upon reaching Hawaii around 3 
million years ago, the common ancestor of the 
honeycreeper species wasted no time adapting 
to the array of food sources found across the 
archipelago. Within 2 million years, 50 species 
of honeycreeper emerged. But only 17 species 
remain today.
Where divergent evolution leads to the 
creation of entirely new species from a common 
ancestor, another evolutionary pathway, known 
as convergent evolution, produces new species 
that have evolved surprisingly similar traits. At 
first glance you might forgive early biologists 
for mistaking dolphins for fish, or bats for a 
member of the bird family. That’s because they 
share similar characteristics: dolphins evolved 
fish-like fins to swim, and bats developed bird­
like wings for flight. However, dolphins and fish 
do not share a common ancestor, and neither 
do birds and bats. The two have completely 
separate evolutionary lineages, yet both

developed similar anatomical features, known 
as analogies. When two species occupy the same 
ecological niche, and are therefore subject to 
the same evolutionary pressures, both evolve 
and adapt in similar ways, over time changing 
into new species that bear a resemblance 
to one another. For birds, the ability to fly 
emerged around 160 million years ago when a 
long-feathered dinosaur called Archaeopteryx, 
flapped its long feathers - which covered the 
skin of dinosaurs for millions of years. The 
elongated length of this dinosaur’s arms helped 
generate some lift beneath them, allowing it 
to fly for short periods of time, in a similar 
way to a modern-day pheasant. Flight gave 
Archaeopteryx an advantage over other animals 
when evading predators, and also hunting prey 
from treetops. Bats, on the other hand, evolved 
only 50 million years ago, descending from an 
unknown mammal species. Scientists think that 
bats evolved from small tree-dwelling mammals 
that eventually developed flaps of skin between 
their toes called interdigital webbing. This 
eventually evolved into wings that not only 
allowed them to glide from tree to tree, but 
actively generate lift like a bird and fly.
Beneath the umbrella of divergent evolution 
there are microevolutions that can lead 
plants and animals down an evolutionary 
path that intertwines with another. Known as 
coevolution, this phenomenon occurs when 
two species develop anatomical characteristics 
as a result of interactions with another species. 
These interactions typically centre around 
one of three processes in nature: pollination, 
parasitism and predation.

Pollinators such as bees and birds have 
evolved side by side with plant species in ways 
that benefit them both. For example, the pollen 
and nectar of the Darwin orchid (Angraecum 
sesquipedale) are found at the end of a long 
tube past its petals, which few pollinators could 
reach. Luckily, one pollinator, Wallace’s sphinx 
moth (Xanthopan morganii praedicta), has 
evolved alongside the orchid and developed 
an enormous tongue called a proboscis. This 
can extend up to almost 30 centimetres for 
lapping up Darwin orchid nectar, picking up 
pollen along the way. It’s not just the orchid that 
benefits - this also provides the sphinx moth 
with a food source other pollinators can’t access.
Unlike coevolution that benefits both species, 
as seen in plant-and-pollinator relationships, 
some animals, such as Alcon blue caterpillars 
(Phengaris alcon), have co-evolved with other
species in ways that make them the perfect 
parasites. By mimicking the scent emitted by the 
larvae of Myrmica ants, Alcon blue caterpillars 
can infiltrate a nest and be welcomed with open 
arms by the ant colony, which will then care for 
them as their own. Studies have also shown 
that when a nest is under threat, the 
emitted scent causes ants to prioritise 
the protection of the caterpillars 
over their own larvae.
Coevolution between predators 
and prey provides some of the most 
perplexing examples of nature’s 
ability to adapt to an environment. 
Typically known as Batesian mimicry, it’s named 
after the 19th-century naturalist Henry Walter 
Bates and occurs when a species has evolved, 
behaviourally or anatomically, to mimic the 
characteristics of another more dangerous or

venomous animal. For example, the caterpillar 
of the spicebush swallowtail butterfly (Papilio 
troilus) has evolved to present markings that 
bear strong resemblance to the head of a 
smooth green snake (Opheodrys vernalis).
The purpose of displaying such a visual 
deception is to fool potential predators 
into believing that they are not the 
prey the predator might have hoped 
for, and are instead a dangerous 
animal that they don’t want to 
interact with. The appearance of 
the spicebush swallowtail caterpillar 
wouldn’t have the same effect without 
the existence of the smooth green snake, and 
thus the result of the snake’s evolution has had a 
direct impact on the evolution of the spicebush 
swallowtail, as it needs to be a convincing 
enough mimic to deter predators.

Amazing examples of how two species have

the markings on a 
cobra’s head
Slow loris and cobra
These furry tree climbers are surprisingly similar 
to snakes and have evolved to mimic some of 
their notable traits. The slow loris is one of the 
only known mammal species to produce venom 
for defence, which it secretes from a gland in its
elbow and then licks to create a venomous saliva in its mouth that
coats its teeth. When threatened, the slow loris hisses and will cross its 
arms over its head, making its face, complete with large eyes, 
resemble the shape and markings of a cobra.
Mirror orchid and scoliid wasp
In the interest of pollination, the mirror orchid (Ophrys speculum) has 
evolved an unusual petal that attracts male scoliid wasps (Dasyscolia 
ciliata). The petal, known as a labellum, closely resembles the furry 
brown bodies of female scoliid wasps. Tricked into thinking he’s found 
a mate, the male wasp lands on the flower’s imitation in hope of 
reproducing. Instead the male wasp finds itself with a head covered 
in pollen as it rubs against the plant’s anther, an organ that contains 
pollen. The wasp will then pollinate another mirror orchid when it once 
again mistakes its petals for another potential mate.
Wasps inside figs
Figs produced by the fig tree (Ficus carica) are known as an 
inflorescence, not a fruit, where the inside of its bulbous body is full 
of clusters of small flowers and seeds. With its flowers on the inside of 
the fig, its only pollinator, a queen fig wasp (Eupristina verticillate), 
burrows into the fig’s outer flesh and lays her eggs within before 
ultimately dying and being digested by the fig for nourishment. 
When the wasp’s offspring hatch, the females gather pollen from 
inside the fig and take it to the next fig, where they will eventually lay 
their own eggs.
Cuckoo egg imposters
The common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus) is one of the worst parents in 
nature - mainly because as soon as the opportunity presents itself, 
female cuckoos will ditch their eggs in the nests of other birds for 
them to raise as their own. The presence of the Trojan egg is unknown 
to the host parent because cuckoos have evolved an egg colouration 
and speckled appearance that resembles the eggs of many other 
bird species, such as warblers, wagtails and pipits. The new host 
parent will raise the new addition until it’s ready to fly the nest and 
continue the parasitic cycle.

are? It’s a molecule called 
deoxyribonucleic acid, 
better known as DNA. 
This omnipotent 
molecule 
is made up of twisted strands of 
sugars and phosphates, creating 
its double-helix shape. Connecting 
the twisting strands are four bases 
known as nucleotides: adenine, 
cytosine, guanine and thymine.
Did you 
know?
Down’s syndrome is

mutation
The sequence in which these bases find 
themselves along each strand of DNA is what 
ultimately determines the development and 
function of an organism.
The way DNA works is similar to the way a 
computer reads binary code. A molecule of DNA 
is divided by varying lengths of base sequences 
called genes. Some genes contain hundreds of 
bases, others millions. Each gene acts as a set of
/
instructions to program an organism, controlling 
what it looks like, how its body functions and 
even how it behaves. The complete set of genetic 
information in an organism is known as its 
genome. The human genome is held in 23 
pairs of chromosomes, long bundles 
of DNA which sit inside the nucleus 
of a cell. The size of an organism’s 
genome varies across the spectrum 
of life - for example, a fruit fly has 
only 4 chromosome pairs, while a dog 
ras 39.
There are two important distinctions 
within a DNA molecule: genes that are 
referred to as coding genes and non-coding 
genes. Around one per cent of DNA is made 
up of coding genes, which actively supply the 
information for the production of proteins. 
Proteins are vital molecules that act as the raw 
ingredients to grow and develop an organism. 
The remaining 99 per cent of DNA is made 
of non-coding genes; these don’t provide the 
blueprints for protein production but can 
influence the way in which proteins are made 
and even prevent production.
Like lines of computer code, when nucleotide 
sequences within a gene are changed, deleted 
or swapped, an organism’s biological program is 
altered. This is known as a mutation. Mutations 
can be split into one of three categories: silent, 
missense and nonsense. Silent mutations 
are, as the name suggests, an alteration of 
nucleotides that have no protein production. 
Missense mutations, on the other hand, will 
alter the function of a protein. Finally, nonsense 
mutations cause proteins to be nonfunctional. 
Mutations occur during the time the cells of an 
organism divide and grow. During cell division, 
all the DNA information within the nucleus 
is unzipped and exactly copied to create a 
perfectly functioning replica. However, on some 
occasions the genetic duplication isn’t exact -

some information is left behind or replaced, 
and a mutation occurs.
The effects of a mutation are wide-ranging. 
Tiny-point mutations, which occur at a single 
nucleotide base pair, occur trillions of times 
among the trillions of cells that make up an 
organism’s body. The majority of these will be 
silent mutations that have no notable effect on 
the organism. However, there are occasions 
when these mutations can have implications to 
the physical appearance of an organism, how 
it behaves or cause a myriad of health 
issues. As an example, polymelia is

an uncommon condition caused by 
a genetic mutation that leads to the 
development of additional limbs. The 
condition is rarely seen in humans 
but is occasionally reported in domestic I 
animals such as chickens and sheep.
As to why mutations occur, scientists still
don’t have a complete picture. There isn’t much
scientific rhyme or reason when it comes to 
spontaneous mutations. Sometimes, during the 
process of cell division, errors are made in the

replication of DNA, which results in a mutation. 
There are also active agents in the world that 
can tip the scales of genetic probability and 
cause a mutation. Active agents that cause a 
mutation are called mutagens and are either 
chemical or radioactive. Chemical mutagens 
are toxins that can alter DNA and lead to a 
whole host of health issues and congenital 
abnormalities. For example, the inhalation of 
asbestos can cause mutations that lead to the 
development of lung cancer.
One of the most striking physical mutations 
seen in the animal kingdom is known as 
bicephaly, or axial bifurcation, whereby an 
organism develops a two-headed but otherwise­
normal body. The most commonly reported 
organisms to experience this rare condition 
are reptiles, typically snakes. However, the 
condition has been seen in species across

human examples. Scientists aren’t completely

environmental pollution or

this involves new

to different birth 
defects.

living tissue to high or prolonged levels of 
radiation - such as X-rays and ultraviolet light 
(UV) - can break down sequences in DNA, 
damage the structure of cells and lead to their 
mutation. The result of mutations caused by 
radiation are typically the development of 
cancers and growth of tumours, along with 
some physical abnormalities - just as it was 
in the wake of the tragic Fukushima Daiichi 
Nuclear Power Plant accident. In 2011, scientists 
discovered that the larvae of pale grass blue 
butterflies (Zizeeria maha), which were exposed 
to the radioactive fallout of the explosion, 
developed much smaller wings and irregular 
eyes compared to unexposed ones. These 
butterflies showed a mutation rate double that 
of butterflies found before the incident.
Often referred to as the ‘raw materials’ 
for evolution, genetic mutations are the 
fundamental building blocks for life on Earth.
Mutant fruit
If you’ve ever bitten into an apple or cut into 
a tomato and found that the seeds inside 
have already begun to germinate, you’ve 
discovered a mutant fruit. The phenomenon 
of ‘live birth’ in some plants is called vivipary. 
This is where the seeds of plants start to 
germinate before they have matured and 
separated from the parent plant. While still 
nestled within the flesh of a tomato or 
sandwiched on an ear of corn, a hormone 
produced by the plant keeps the seeds from 
entering into the next stage of growth. 
However, if that hormone runs out, the seeds 
are free to germinate. In the case of vivipary 
plants, a genetic mutation inhibits the 
production of the germination-preventing 
hormone and tiny shoots prematurely 
emerge from the fruit.

The father of evolution Charles Darwin penned 
the theory of natural selection in the mid-1800s, 
offering explanations for life and the biological 
journey it had undertaken through time to 
become what we know today. The theory of 
natural selection proposed that only 
members of a species that are able 
H
to adapt to their environments will

survive long enough to reproduce 
and continue their lineage. 
|
However, Darwin remained in the H f.;jl 
dark about the role genetics played 
in evolution. That knowledge came 
from Dutch botanist Hugo de Vries at 
the beginning of the 20th century.
Natural selection is driven by mutations in an 
organism’s DNA that cause a beneficial physical
or behavioural trait that ensures their survival. 
Those traits are then passed on to the next 
generation, and over time the species evolves. 
Members of the species that don’t genetically 
mutate and adapt often die before they can 
pass their DNA on to their offspring.
For an entire species to evolve, the 
development and mutation of DNA 
occurs over thousands of years. For 
example, over millennia the DNA of 
some giraffes mutated to allow them 
■ I to grow long necks and tall legs to 
H reach parts of trees that other shorter 
giraffes and herbivores struggled to get 
to. Their long necks gave them an advantage 
and increased their chance of survival, although 
natural selection and mutation-driven evolution 
isn’t a thing of the past. There are many 
examples of modern-day mutants, showing 
scientists the next potential stages in their 
evolution, including humans.
Two-headed snakes and poison-protected 
mice are far from being alone in their 
mutations. To find one of the most advanced 
mutants on Earth, you need only look in 
the mirror. Considering the fact that genetic 
mutations are the raw materials of evolution, 
we as humans have undergone countless 
changes in our genetic makeup over the past 
10,000 years to become the apex predators and 
technological innovators that we are today. Over 
millennia, both small and large mutations to the 
human genome have propelled our evolution

that codes for proteins that can digest 
lactose typically switch off after infancy, 
but a mutation in some humans 
stops that from happening.

our species from around 
the world are evolving
1 Altitude tolerance
In less than 3,000 years, some Tibetans and Han Chinese 
people have evolved to live at altitudes most people could 
not - at altitudes of 4,000 metres where the oxygen levels are 
around 40 per cent lower than at sea level, Tibetan villagers 
have been thriving in the thin air. Researchers have identified 
30 genetic mutations within those people that live at these 
impressive altitudes, half of which are related to the way the 
human body uses oxygen and helps the individual manage 
haemoglobin concentrations.
2 Deep divers
The deep-sea-diving Bajau people of Southeast Asia have 
shown a remarkable example of human evolution by building 
the biological equivalent of a scuba tank. The human spleen 
is typically used to filter blood as part of the body’s immune 
system. Through genetic mutations, the people of Bajau have 
evolved a larger spleen than most, around 50 per cent bigger 
on average. A large spleen can act as a reservoir of 
oxygenated blood while diving, allowing the Bajau people to 
deep dive up to 70 metres below the surface.
3 Getting taller
In the mid-18th century, the average Dutch soldier was 
recorded to be 165 centimetres tall. However, the modern-day 
Dutchman is a towering 182.5 centimetres tall on average.
Over the same period, the average American has grown by 
only six centimetres. It’s thought that the 20-centimetre 
increase is down to natural selection - a preference for tall 
men among Dutch women.
4 vegetarian nutrition
Scientists found that 70 per cent of vegetarians in Pune, India, 
that they surveyed have a genetic mutation in the FADS2 gene 
that allows them to produce essential omega-3 and other 
fatty acids from a non-meat diet. Fatty acids such as omega-3 
are abundant in fish and red meat, but sparse in vegetables. 
The FADS2 mutation is thought to help vegetarians effectively 
process these fatty acids from alternative sources.

breeding wild animals with traits beneficial 
for humans - for meat, milk or materials. Over 
millennia, humans have bred generations of 
animals like cows, sheep, pigs and chickens 
to enhance qualities such as their 
muscle mass for meat and wool 
production for fabrics.
The first wild animal to be 
taken by humans from its natural 
environment was the predecessor 
of the modern-day sheep, the Asiatic 
mouflon (Ovis orientalis), around 11,000 
years ago. Since then, humans have captured 
and domesticated 38 different species, 
including 8,800 different breeds, from around 
the world.
The specific techniques that primitive 
farmers used to tame and domesticate livestock 
throughout history are largely unknown to 
archaeologists. However, in 2014 researchers 
uncovered some clues in an ancient settlement 
in Turkey. Around 11,000 years ago, a small 
village on the banks of the Melendiz River 
in Turkey was home to some of the earliest

in areas researchers believed to be pens in the 
middle of the village, used to acclimatise the 
sheep to humans. Villagers likely introduced 
young sheep as pets to their villages, too.
The theory as to why wild sheep 
were originally stabled is related to 
other agricultural processes, such as 
crop growing. As prolific hunters, 
early farmers may have had to 
weigh up spending time further 
afield hunting compared to time spent 
on crop farming. To optimise their time, 
hunters brought their prey to the farm to breed 
and produce a sustainable supply of food to the 
village while still tending their crops.
Animal domestication and human evolution 
are intertwined. Not only have humans bred 
livestock and changed the biology of domestic 
animals, but domestic animals have also 
affected how humans have evolved. One of the 
most apparent examples lies in our ability to 
digest a sugar called lactose. As infants, many 
mammal species begin their lives suckling 
milk from their mothers. However, at varying
Human-made 
animals
Cats, dogs and cattle aren’t the only 
animals that humans have altered 
through domestication. Without human 
intervention, animals such as pigeons 
and goldfish wouldn’t exist. More than 400 
million pigeons live around the world, 
and they all descend from a domestic 
species called the rock dove (Columba 
livia). These birds originated in ancient 
Mesopotamia and Egypt and were 
enticed into the city as a source of food 
around 10,000 years ago. Throughout 
history, rock doves - and subsequently 
pigeons - have proven to be more 
beneficial than a quick meal thanks to 
their navigational skills as messenger 
pigeons. Naturally, captive pigeons found 
their way out of breeding centres and into 
cities, benefiting from the cliff-like 
buildings for their nests and bountiful 
sources of food. Now, in an age where 
pigeon pilots are no longer needed for 
sending messages, the world is left with a 
species of bird that wouldn’t have existed 
without humans.

points in time infants are weaned off their 
milk supply, losing their ability to process 
lactose and either becoming plant-munching 
herbivores or flesh-eating predators. Humans, 
on the other hand, developed a tolerance for 
the milk sugar, known as lactase persistence. 
A genetic mutation, lactase persistence enables 
the continued production of an enzyme that can 
break down lactose and metabolise it.
Although the ancient ancestors of modern 
cows, called aurochs, were originally 
domesticated solely for their meat around 10,000 
years ago, around 6,000 years ago dairy farming 
began among European farmers, roughly around 
the same time humans developed a tolerance for 
lactose past infancy. Now lactose persistence is 
found in around 35 per cent of adults globally.
But domestication isn’t all it’s cracked up to 
be. Although raising livestock has facilitated 
the advancement of human civilisation, it’s also 
brought with it disease. During the evolution 
of animal domestication, confining animals has 
facilitated the transmission of pathogens and 
parasites to humans - for example tuberculosis 
among cows and influenza from pigs.

Why is it that so many 
domesticated animals 
look so far removed from 
their wild ancestors? The 
answer lies in a 
phenomenon called 
domestication syndrome. 
When you look at any 
domesticated animal, 
you’ll notice a lot of them 
share common physical 
and behavioural traits, 
including floppy ears, 
tameness and changes in 
their tails. Scientists have 
been studying this since 
Charles Darwin proposed 
it in 1868. Over decades, 
Russian scientist Dmitry 
Belyaev conducted an 
experiment where silver 
foxes were selectively 
bred for tameness. After 
45 generations of
selecting for this 
behaviour, the foxes had 
become more like dogs, 
with wagging tails and 
floppy ears. The 
syndrome remains largely 
a mystery, but some 
scientists have suggested 
that selecting for 
tameness affects cell 
development during the 
embryonic stage.

Why animals 
shed
any creatures throughout the 
M animal kingdom undergo a process 
of physical transformation called 
moulting. Whether they create 
ghostly serpent sleeves as a result 
or just ditch clumps of old skin and fur, shedding 
is an important stage in an animal’s growth 
and survival. The terms moulting and 
shedding are often used interchangeably, g 
but there’s a slight difference between 
each process. Moulting is the removal 
of an animal’s entire skin, feathers, 
shell or exoskeleton as it grows, j 
which often occurs on a seasonal 
basis. For example, elephant seals 
(Mirounga leonina) undergo what 
is known as a ‘catastrophic moult’ j 
during late summer. As dramatic I 
as it sounds, the ‘catastrophic’ | 
nature of these moults merely 
relates to the large patches of skin 
that shed at one time. During this 
time, blood flow within the seals 
is redirected towards their skin to 
produce a new outermost skin layer, 
known as the epidermis. This puts their 
vital organs at risk in the freezing oceans 
they inhabit, so moulting has to be carried 
out on land.
Shedding hair and skin, on the other hand, can 
occur more regularly and be the result of dryness 
or a temperature change. Snakes generally moult

Along with a heap of excess 
fur to clean up, being around a 
dog that likes to shed its fur can 
trigger human allergies. Siberian 
Huskies, for example, are some 
of the heaviest shredders in the 
canine world. This is mainly due 
to their role as sled dogs in cold 
climates, as shedding helps 
maintain their thick, healthy 
coats. But what’s good for 
plummeting temperatures can 
wreak havoc on their owner’s 
nose. When dogs shed, they also 
shed skin cells. These can find 
their way into the nostrils and 
mouth of the owner, triggering 
the body’s immune system 
and causing allergic relations. 
However, many dog breeds, such 
as the Afghan Hound and Giant 
Schnauzer, have been deemed 
hypoallergenic. This means that 
while no dog is completely free 
from shedding, some shed at 
such a low level that allergic 
reactions can be avoided.

dog breeds shed their fur all year round. Even 
humans unknowingly spend their time shedding 
old skin and hair - around 500 million skin cells 
and around 100 hairs each day.
Snakes are some of nature’s best moulters. 
In the same way that humans outgrow clothes 
through their early years of life, snakes 
periodically peel a surface layer of scales to 
prepare for their bodies to expand and grow. 
Between 4 and 12 times a year, a snake will 
undergo a full-body moult, known as ecdysis. 
The outer layers of skin cells are detached 
in a continuous sheet from the newly grown 
dermis below. A protective scale covering the 
snake’s eye, called the spectacle, also sheds 
during this process. While all snakes 
and reptiles shed, not all of them 
create fully formed scale replicas 
of themselves. Tortoises, turtles 
and some lizards shed their skin 
gradually, often in dry patches that 
flake away.
Like snakes, there’s a whole host of 
animals that undergo complete ecdysis when 
it’s time to grow up, including eight-legged 
arachnids, crustaceans and all manner of 
insects. Unlike the cocoon-spinning abilities 
of many metamorphic insects, such as moths 
and butterflies, others make their winged 
transformations beneath their protective 
exoskeletons. As larvae, dragonflies live beneath 
the water, often found in ponds and lakes. 
These wingless juveniles skip the pupal stage of 
metamorphosis and head straight to moulting.

After several days of internal 
metamorphosis underwater, the 
larva climbs out of the depths and up 
onto a nearby leaf, and within a few 
hours the newly winged dragonfly breaks 
through the beak of the previous exoskeleton, 
called an exuvia. But what happens to the 
leftover exoskeleton?
Some insects, like dragonflies and 
cicadas, don’t do anything with their exuviae. 
However, many insects, such as pill bugs 
(Armadillidium vulgare) and American 
cockroaches (Periplaneta americana), waste 
no time in munching down on their previous 
bodies to reabsorb valuable proteins and 
chitin within the exuviae. Leaving behind a 
hollow replica of your body can also act as 
a beacon to predators, signalling that there’s 
prey around that may be without its protective 
exoskeleton. Eating their old body reduces the 
risk of being discovered.
Eating your 
own skin
For amphibians, skin is much more than a 
protective barrier - it’s also how they 
breathe. Frogs and toads have both evolved 
moist skin that allows gases such as oxygen 
to pass through the surface and into their 
bloodstream. As amphibians grow, their skin 
sheds, but not as a whole piece like their 
reptilian cousins. Instead, patches flake 
away from the body regularly, with some 
species shedding their entire skin daily and 
others taking a weeks to completely shed. 
Once the old skin layer has separated, 
amphibians ferry the flake along the body 
towards the mouth and eat it. Known as 
dermatophagy, the process of regularly 
eating their skin not only lets the amphibian 
recuperate some of its nutritional losses but 
also prevents it from drying out. Ensuring that 
their skin is soft and permeable enough to 
exchange atmospheric gases is vital to their 
continuing survival.

Instead of shedding an entire body’s worth 
of skin and exoskeleton, some animals, such as 
reindeer and moose, undergo a partial moulting 
process to reveal a new set of antlers. Unlike 
the horns on the heads of buffalo or gazelle, 
reindeer have similar structures called antlers. 
Antlers are bony appendages that grow out of 
the skull, as opposed to horns, which are not 
attached to the skull and are predominantly 
made of the same material as human hair 
and nails, called keratin. As antlers grow, they 
emerge from the head covered in skin and soft 
hair, commonly called velvet. As the animal 
grows, the bone within develops and compacts 
to form rigid antler bone. When the antlers are 
fully developed, the velvet dries out and begins 
to feel itchy. This causes the antler owner to 
scratch them against hard surfaces such as trees 
and rocks to tear away the skin and velvet, 
leaving only the bone behind. This stage of a 
reindeer’s development might look like a scene 
from a gory movie, but blood supply is reduced 
during shedding, and it’s believed that this 
prevents the animals from feeling any pain. The 
process is swift - it takes around 24 hours to 
remove the velvet.
It’s not just scales and fur that need to be shed 
during the changing seasons. Before the chill 
of winter descends, many bird species begin 
maintenance work on their bodies, particularly

replace the gastropod shells that they 
call home when they’ve outgrown them. 
Once a larger, unoccupied shell has 
been spotted, the small crustacean 
releases its old shell and backs into the 
new one. Hermit crabs use the tip of their 
adapted abdomen to clasp onto a 
pillar-like structure found within many 
shells, called the columella, to secure 
themselves in place. Although crabs 
often make the switch when they 
encounter a rogue shell, crabs such as 
long-wristed hermit crabs (Pagurus 
longicarpus) exchange houses in a chain 
with other crabs. When these exchanges 
aren’t amicable, crabs will attack each 
other by striking each other’s shells in the 
hope of securing a shell eviction.
their feathers. Throughout the year, some 
feathers may have suffered wear and tear, and so 
the birds embark on patterns of shedding, though 
this can come at a cost to their ability to fly. 
During moulting, some birds, such as swans and 
geese, lose all of their flight feathers at the same 
time, completely grounding them for around six 
weeks before they can grow new ones.
Other than outgrowing their own body, 
there’s one other reason an animal 
might want to step outside of their 
old skin... parasites. The natural 
world is full of fungal, bacterial 
and animal parasites whose main 
goal is to find a way to extract 
sustenance from their host. The ocean
is Uttered with parasitic organisms that 
are just waiting to find their way into the cracks 
of a crustacean’s shell. Parasites such as isopods 
and barnacles try to burrow their way past the 
protection of crab and lobster shells to syphon 
off nutrients and find a source of food. To 
prevent parasites from taking hold, crustaceans 
undergo ecdysis to grow a new body within 
their existing sheU and then step out of their old 
one, hopefully leaving the parasites behind.
Creating a new shell or exoskeleton comes 
at a cost to the creature. Once a giant mud 
crab (Scylla serrata) has completed ecdysis, the

body that emerges from the previous shell is 
completely soft. While the crab is vulnerable to 
predation without its usuaUy tough exterior, it 
can find a protected spot and wait for its new 
sheU to harden. Within a matter of days, the 
new sheU hardens and the crab is free to face 
the world again.
It’s not just critters and crabs that shed to 
strip away parasites, with some plant 
life doing the same. Throughout late 
spring and early autumn, the silver 
birch tree (Betula pendula) sheds 
thin paper-like layers of its bark. 
This reduces the opportunities for 
parasites and other invertebrates 
to burrow into healthy bark and
potentially cause an infection. The faUen 
bark also releases nutrients back into the 
soil when it decomposes, which can then be 
reabsorbed through the tree’s roots.
But moulting isn’t for everyone. Some 
animals have avoided shedding entirely, 
despite their growth. Fish scales, for example, 
grow with the fish rather than being shed and 
replaced. This can be handy for scientists trying 
to accurately age them; some fish species have 
scales with concentric ridges - similar to the 
rings in the trunk of a tree - that are used as an 
indication of age.

swiftly develop a blood supply within 
the first few weeks of development, but 
without functioning lungs, kidneys or a 
gastrointestinal tract, a foetus must 
rely on its parent for oxygen and 
nutrients. The maternal blood supply is 
connected to foetal circulation via the 
placenta and the umbilical cord, 
which contains two umbilical arteries 
and one umbilical vein. The two 
arteries escort deoxygenated blood 
from the foetus to the placenta, while 
the vein carries oxygenated and 
nutritious blood from the placenta to 
the foetal heart.

4 Into the depths
The common femoral artery 
feeds the deep femoral 
artery that supplies blood 
to the buttocks, femur and 
hips, and the superficial 
femoral artery that supplies 
the lower leg.
5 Branching paths
Blood travels through 
smaller arteries, into yet 
smaller arterioles, then into 
capillaries - the smallest 
set of blood vessels.
6 Nutrients for waste 
Capillaries are thin enough that 
oxygen and nutrients can be 
exchanged for carbon dioxide 
and waste products between the 
blood and neighbouring cells. 
Deoxygenated blood then exits 
the capillaries into venules.
For blood to efficiently migrate 
throughout and around the body, it 
must maintain optimal levels of 
pressure. Oxygenated blood from the 
left side of the heart is pumped out at 
high pressure, so arteries must be able 
to withstand and maintain this force. 
They withstand pressure by possessing 
a thick, muscular wall with an outer, 
middle and inner layer, and they 
maintain pressure by possessing a 
narrow lumen - the space that the 
blood travels through. Elastic arteries, 
which are found near the heart 
muscle, possess more elastic tissue 
in their middle layer. This helps convert 
the incremental pulses of pressure 
from heartbeats into a more constant 
pressure. Capillaries are also highly 
pressurised, but on a much smaller 
scale. Their lumens are very narrow 
and their cell walls are only one cell 
thick. In contrast, veins also possess 
three layers in their walls, but these are 
much thinner. But their lumens are 
much wider, yielding lower pressures.

Common 
diseases 
of blood 
vessels
n the UK, diseases affecting 
I blood vessels are among the 
biggest killers each year. 
The cells of our body are so 
dependent on the oxygen and 
nutrients supplied by blood 
that a blockage or rupture in the vascular 
network can quickly cause catastrophic 
damage. While some diseases are genetic, 
many common diseases are caused at least in 
part by lifestyle choices, such as a poor diet, 
which results in the bloodstream carrying 
more harmful compounds than it ideally 
should. With an increasingly high-fat and 
sedentary lifestyle, these diseases are growing 
ever more frequent. Fortunately, however, 
lifestyle changes and medical innovations are 
helping to save lives.
Coronary arteries 
supply the heart with 
blood, but blockage 
of these vessels 
can lead to a 
heart attack

per cent of

Coronary 
artery disease
Just like all other muscles in our body, the heart 
requires a supply of blood to fuel itself. However, 
rather than gaining nutrients and oxygen from 
oxygenated blood pumped in and out of its 
internal chambers, the heart muscle relies on 
coronary arteries wrapped around its exterior for 
its blood supply. Over time, components 
transported by the blood such as cholesterol can 
stick to the walls of coronary arteries, initiating 
blockages that can partially or completely block 
the blood supply to parts of the heart. This 
process is known as atherosclerosis and can 
result in angina, which is chest pain caused by an 
insufficient blood supply to the heart. If 
the coronary arteries are fully blocked, however, 
cell death of part of the heart can occur, causing 
a heart attack. Coronary artery disease can be 
treated using bypass graft surgery, where arteries 
are rerouted to supply the regions of the heart cut 
off by coronary artery blockages.
Fixing vessels
An angioplasty uses inflated tubes to salvage obstructed arteries
Surgery is sometimes necessary to combat 
blockages and ruptures of the vascular network
Cholesterol floating in the bloodstream 
becomes attached to the wall of the artery, 
drawing fats and causing inflammation. 
This results in the formation of a plaque 
which narrows the artery.
A thin catheter is threaded through the 
artery towards the plaque buildup. A 
balloon at the tip is then inflated, pressing 
a mesh wire against the plaque, forcing it 
outwards and widening the artery.
Stroke
Atherosclerosis describes the accumulation of 
plaque on arterial walls. These may originate 
at various places throughout the body, but can 
become dislodged and carried elsewhere in 
the bloodstream. Eventually they can become 
stuck and cause a blood clot, blocking the 
artery and preventing blood flow to tissues and 
organs. If this blood clot occurs in the arteries 
that feed the brain, it can cause an ischaemic
stroke. After being deprived of oxygen, brain 
cells very swiftly begin to die, causing 
numerous symptoms relating to the areas 
controlled by the affected region of the brain.
If one side of the brain is damaged, the
opposite side of the body shows symptoms, 
which can include drooping of one side of the 
face, numbness in the corresponding arm and 
slurred speech.

Peripheral 
artery disease
A narrowing or hardening of artery wails can 
prove fatal when affecting organs such as 
the heart or brain, but obstructed arteries 
feeding the peripheral organs can go 
unnoticed until the disease is at an 
advanced stage. Depleted blood flow to the 
legs can cause symptoms such as 
cramping, an absence of hair and 
gangrene that occurs following cell death. 
Individuals living with diabetes are at 
particular risk of developing peripheral 
artery disease due to the abundance of 
glucose in blood plasma. This interferes with 
other components in the blood, leading to 
plaque formation. However, a healthy 
lifestyle involving regular exercise, not 
smoking and a low-fat, high-fibre diet can 
help prevent arterial disease for most adults.
Deep vein 
thrombosis
Blood clots can appear rapidly in 
veins where blood flow is slow and 
laboured, most common in veins 
deep in leg muscle. During these 
cases, such as when a person’s legs 
remain unmoved for long periods, an 
excess of natural clotting factors in 
the bloodstream can overstimulate 
the production of a blood clot. In 
healthy blood, clots form to prevent 
bleeding, but during deep vein 
thrombosis the formed clot can grow 
to a substantial size - large enough 
to obstruct blood flow. This can 
cause pain, swelling and a change 
in colour of the leg. However, the clot 
can cause more damage if it travels 
further through the vascular network 
into the vessels supplying the lungs, 
resulting in a pulmonary embolism 
that can prove fatal.

Unravelling the 
nervous system
Explore the electrically charged network composed 
of billions of cells that coordinates your thoughts, 
feelings and actions from head to toe
uman beings are 
H wonderfully complex.
Relative to the numerous 
single-celled organisms on 
our planet, humans are 
gargantuan superstructures. 
We boast trillions of cells that work to assemble 
and maintain an array of specialised tissues, 
organs and bones. Together these form a single 
being that walks, talks, thinks and feels. This 
exceptional complexity is only made possible 
by a coordination centre that monitors and 
controls the actions of our human form.
We refer to this coordination centre as the 
nervous system. Consisting of the brain, spinal 
cord and reams of nerves that connect them 
to the rest of the body, the nervous system 
is a truly vast and dense network of cells. 
Collectively, their function is to exchange and 
relay information through electrical impulses, 
giving us the power of thought and action.
Many prominent thinkers of Hellenic 
antiquity, the ancient civilisations around 
Greece, were obsessed with the complexities 
of human thought, constantly questioning 
and probing our understanding of ourselves 
and our place in the natural world. But some 
scholars, such as the Greek anatomist Galen, 
took a literal interest in our thoughts as well as 
a philosophical one, and decided to delve into 
dissected pigs in search of the organ that made 
thought possible. Through his studies, Galen 
collected evidence that centred the brain as the 
hub of thought, action and memory. As well 
as championing the brain as the nexus of the 
body, Galen also found nerve fibres in his pig 
subjects that spread outwards from the brain 
and into the periphery of their bodies. He even 
went as far to decipher that these nerves were 
not all the same, but specialised into sensory 
nerves that received signals and motor nerves 
that relayed instructions.
Many years later, but not too far away, 
Renaissance anatomists in Italy sliced and diced 
human brains to expand our knowledge of the 
organ. They discovered specialised regions like 
the pons, which acts as a ‘bridge’ connecting 
other brain regions, and the hypothalamus, 
which was found later to control hormone 
production. In England in the following 
century, Thomas Willis deduced that the brain 
controlled both voluntary and involuntary 
actions. Scholars were beginning to map the 
network of the nervous system, but how signals 
travelled around the network only became 
clear once Benjamin Franklin went out in a 
thunderstorm holding a metal key and a kite. 
In doing so, he performed an experiment that
led to the discovery of electricity. This allowed 
scientists to reconsider how our nerves could 
be receiving and exchanging signals, eventually 
inspiring Emil du Bois-Reymond to confirm that 
electricity is the conduit by which information 
is exchanged in our neural pathways.
Centuries of research uncovered the highway 
of cells travelled by electrical signals to govern 
our actions, but chemical signals are required 
too. Neurons don’t touch one another like a 
continuous road, but instead are separated by 
small gaps of water containing charged atoms, 
or ions. These gaps are known as synapses, 
which act as a bridge between neurons. Once 
a signal reaches the end of a neuron, at the 
axon, compounds called neurotransmitters are 
released. These cross the bridge and bind to the 
dendrites - the signal receivers of neighbouring 
neurons. This causes the next neuron to ‘fire’ 
its own electrical signal.
Despite this crossing happening between 
every neuron, the remarkable structure of 
the nervous system allows signals to be sent 
across the body in a fraction of a second. 
While we now understand much about the 
broader organisation of nerves and the way 
they function on a single-cell level, the nervous 
system continues to hold many mysteries for us 
to solve.

peripheral nervous system. When actions

go to the brain. The

neuronal activity, 
with billions of interwoven neurons firing 
to preserve and recall memories, coordinate 
thoughts and speech and plan future actions. 
Along with the spinal cord, the bone-clad 
parts of our nervous system are called the 
central nervous system. The majority of 
our neurons are shielded behind protective 
fluid and bone, where they receive signals 
from and dictate to organs around the body. 
have some means of reaching their target 
organs. For that they need to connect to nerves 
that stretch from the central nervous system 
all the way to the extremities of the body. 
This second network of nerves is called the 
peripheral nervous system. Together the central 
and peripheral form the major divisions of the 
nervous system.
The peripheral nervous system is responsible 
for many functions, and as such has numerous 
subdivisions that specialise in different tasks. 
The sensory, or afferent division receives 
signals from the periphery and carries these 
into the central nervous system. The motor, or 
efferent division transmits signals for actions 
our brain can assume control of a few of these 
processes - think of holding your breath - 
autonomic functions will continue to operate 
even when we fall asleep or are unconscious.
The processes that we cannot control, 
however, are by no means unchanging. Instead 
the organs under the control of the autonomic 
nervous system are regulated by a balance 
between the sympathetic and parasympathetic 
nervous systems. Depending on stimuli, such as 
external sensations, these systems increase or 
decrease activity of our internal organs, helping 
to ensure our body is always ready to respond 
to the challenge at hand.
However, the signals sent from the 
central nervous system must

peripheral 
nerves,

system are

outwards from the central nervous system 
to the peripheral organs and muscles.
These motor functions come in two 
forms: somatic and autonomic. Somatic 
functions are perhaps the easiest 
concept of the nervous system to grasp, 
as these dictate all of our voluntary 
actions, such as choosing to pick up a cup 
or jump on the bed.
Not all somatic motor functions are 
voluntary, however. Some are automatic, 
preprogrammed responses built into our 
bodies that help us cope with danger, known 
as somatic reflexes. You’ll notice such a reflex 
when you accidentally touch a hot stove, step 
on a sharp object or something flies towards 
your eye - your body reacts before you’re 
aware of it. Your hand pulls away, you hop onto 
the other foot or your eyelid slams shut. This 
is all the work of somatic reflexes, which can 
act incredibly quickly as they do not require 
voluntary input from the brain. Such reflexes 
can come in different flavours - pulling your 
hand away from danger is known as a flexor 
or withdrawal reflex, whereas stepping on a 
sharp object initiates a crossed-extensor reflex. 
This latter reflex automatically triggers multiple 
motor functions: as one leg retracts the other 
leg simultaneously expands and becomes more 
stable, preventing us from falling over.
The innate, hard-wired reflex responses 
of our peripheral nervous system help keep 
us safe from danger, but they are not the

Regions of the brain
The brain makes sense of the world around 
us. It collects information from the five 
senses, interprets them and returns with 
instructions for the body’s muscles and 
organs using its three major domains. The 
cerebrum is the largest part of the brain. It’s 
split into two hemispheres, separated by a 
fissure that’s visible when looking at the 
brain from above. The left hemisphere 
controls muscles on the right side of the 
body, and vice versa.
As well as motor control, the cerebrum is 
responsible for interpreting touch, vision and 
sound; controlling our sense of reasoning 
and determining our emotions. The 
cerebellum, nestled under the cerebrum, 
coordinates posture, balance and other 
muscle movements. Finally, the brainstem 
acts as a conduit, connecting the other 
regions of the brain to the spinal cord.
The brain is composed of three major regions;

Bell’s Palsy
Nerves spread out from the central nervous 
system to various organs and tissues, with 
each powering specific functions. Cranial 
nerve VII is known as the facial nerve, as it 
controls many of the muscles on our face, 
including blinking and smiling. When this 
nerve is inflamed, damaged or disrupted, 
Bell’s palsy can occur, with the facial 
muscles becoming weakened or paralysed. 
This typically affects only one side of the 
face, causing drooping of the mouth on one 
side and a loss of control of an eyelid, giving 
the affected side a slack appearance. The 
full symptoms of Bell’s palsy are often 
temporary, with some or total recovery of the 
affected areas occurring within six months. 
While it’s not always clear what causes the 
cranial nerve to swell and Bell’s palsy to 
occur, scientists believe that a recurring viral 
infection of the nervous system elicits an 
immune response that triggers the nerve 
damage and causes the symptoms.

Multiple sclerosis
Neurons are the agents of signalling in our 
bodies, but they don’t work alone. Axons, 
which carry signals away from the neuron’s 
cell body, are coated in a sheaf of myelin. 
Myelin sheaves are produced in the central 
nervous system by cells called 
oligodendrocytes, enabling myelin’s function 
of protecting and facilitating nerve
conductivity. In multiple sclerosis, a severe 
abnormal immune response within the 
central nervous system strips away the 
protective myelin and subsequently causes 
lots of nerve scarring, or sclerosis, which 
gives the disease its name. Research efforts 
are underway to treat the disease by 
encouraging myelin regeneration.
Damaged myelin
Peripheral neuropathy from diabetes can result in a

In multiple sclerosis, the immune system 
causes inflammation that destroys myelin 
and the cells that produce it.
Without myelin, nerves are 
vulnerable to inflammation 
damage, which causes 
scarring, and are less able to 
conduct nerve signals.

neuropathies lead to a loss of sensation and 
regulatory control of extremities. These include a 
loss of coordination and feeling in fingers and 
toes and a lack of balance. The causes of 
peripheral neuropathy are yet to be fully made 
clear, but scientists have determined diabetes, 
which causes protracted periods of high blood 
sugar, as one of the primary causes.

can become impaired and begin to die. The 
result of this is Parkinson’s disease, as the loss of 
dopamine gradually hampers key functions 
such as walking, talking and memory recall. 
These effects are compounded by the loss of 
nerves responsible for producing 
norepinephrine, a key compound in the

f you’ve ever wondered why you 
never seem to get any taller while 
your friends are regularly growing 
out of their clothes, why your 
skin always breaks out in spots 
when you want to look your best 
and why you’re always hungry no matter how 
much you eat, you need look no further than 
your hormones. But what exactly are hormones, 
and why do they seem intent on interfering in 
almost every aspect of your life?
In simple terms, hormones are chemical 
molecules that act like an internal postal 
service. These specialised proteins carry 
vital messages around the body via the 
bloodstream - thanks to the circulatory 
system and a strong, beating heart - to 
their target cells, where they give out clear 
instructions. Different types of hormones will 
give instructions to entirely different organs 
and tissues within the body. This ingenious 
system begins before your birth and continues 
to make appropriate changes to your body 
throughout your entire life, allowing you to 
develop, grow, thrive and survive.
The endocrine system plays an important role 
in the transition from foetus to independent 
newborn baby. Endocrine cells have started to 
disperse within a few weeks of gestation, and by 
13 weeks have developed a hypothalamus and a 
pituitary gland. The foetus takes hormones from 
the parent and the placenta acts as a temporary 
endocrine organ, sharing nutrients and 
messages between the two. This is expelled as 
the baby is pushed out. The hormones help the 
foetus to develop and grow in utero, giving it 
the best chance to survive the birthing process. 
As soon as the baby is born, the endocrine 
system controls every aspect of its life, from 
growth and strength to temperature and mood. 
However, it’s when reaching puberty - usually 
around the=age of 12 - that most people become 
aware of the importance of hormones.

It’s during puberty that our bodies develop 
into their peak physical state and complete 
sexual maturity. The endocrine system 
instigates some dramatic bodily changes that 
can be very confusing and frightening for any 
unprepared teenager. As adolescence begins, 
the hypothalamus and pituitary gland stimulate 
the gonads (ovaries or testes) to produce a 
variety of hormones that prompt new sexual 
characteristics. Oestrogen and progesterone 
increase in girls, causing the breasts to enlarge 
and the menstrual cycle to begin. Meanwhile, 
an increase in testosterone in boys initiates 
a deepening of the voice, enlargement of the 
sexual organs and an increase in facial hair. 
Temperament also alters, and often not for the 
better. In medieval times, before there was any 
understanding of hormonal flux, previously 
angelic children were sometimes thought to 
have been possessed by the devil when they 
reached adolescence.
But any system can malfunction, and the 
endocrine system is no different. An imbalance 
of hormones in a young child or adolescent can 
bring about a multitude of disorders. Precocious 
puberty occurs when a child begins the 
transition into sexual maturity at a very early 
age. The hypothalamus sends signals to release 
sexual hormones too soon, causing little girls to 
start their periods before the age of eight. This 
can sometimes be brought about by a tumour 
growing on one of the key endocrine glands. 
Meanwhile, a lack of the growth hormone 
can lead to dwarfism, and a deficiency in the 
hormone insulin can lead to childhood diabetes. 
It’s vitally important that parents maintain a 
watchful eye over their children to ensure that 
any endocrine issues are dealt with swiftly, since 
early treatment of a hormonal imbalance can 
prevent long-term health problems.
The endocrine system plays a vital role in 
adulthood, too. Hormones such as insulin 
and glucagon support the regulation of 
metabolic health, since they balance blood sugar 
levels. As our lives become more complicated 
with financial commitments and employment 
obligations, adults need to be capable of 
remaining calm under pressure in order to stay 
healthy. The adrenal glands release cortisol and 
adrenaline to combat spiking stress levels and 
maintain stable blood pressure. The T3 hormone 
released from the thyroid gland works alongside 
calcitonin to maintain healthy strong bones and 
proper growth.
A crucial role for the endocrine system 
in an adult’s life concerns reproductive 
hormones. Oestrogen and progesterone, starting 
in puberty, continue to be extraordinarily 
important, as they not only synchronise the 
menstrual cycle, but also support cardiovascular

Scientists have come a long way in their 
understanding of the pituitary gland and its 
many functions, but although it’s only 
relatively recently that we have fully 
understood its importance, we’ve been 
aware of its presence for centuries. As long 
ago as 150 CE, Greek physician and 
philosopher Galen identified the gland 
and, noting its ability to secrete 
substances, suggested that its purpose was 
to help drain phlegm from the brain. By the 
early 18th century, doctors had discovered 
various anatomical elements of the gland, 
such as the hypothalamo-hypophyseal 
axis linking the pituitary gland to the 
hypothalamus - although at that time they 
were unaware how important this 
connection was. Various pituitary-related 
diseases were discovered throughoutthe 
18th century, and by the mid-19th century 
Dr Martin Rathke described its formation. 
As time progressed, scientists discovered 
how vital the pituitary gland is to our 
continuing survival and how it is 
manipulated by the hypothalamus.

CONTROL YOUR BODY
health, bone health and brain function. The 
same can be said of the male hormone, 
testosterone, as it also supports bone health 
and muscle formation alongside general 
reproductive wellbeing.
When a person becomes pregnant, the 
endocrine system needs to work doubly hard 
as it is supporting two individuals and must 
finely balance the needs of the parent with the 
requirements of a developing foetus, while also 
accommodating the parent’s physical bodily 
changes. Many of the common complaints 
that arise during pregnancy, such as swollen 
ankles, heartburn, raised blood pressure and 
constipation, are all dealt with via hormones.
As we slide into old age, the endocrine system 
instigates more hormonal changes, which in 
turn causes a multitude of alterations and 
modifications to our bodies. Oestrogen levels 
lower, initiating menopause, a state where the 
body can no longer reproduce. The growth 
hormone diminishes, as does testosterone, so 
both males and females become more clinically 
vulnerable. Bone density and muscle mass 
decrease and the immune system weakens. 
Glands within the endocrine system take longer 
to produce hormones and often secrete far less 
than when the body was younger, while the 
hormones themselves take far longer to break 
down. Such changes negatively affect the body’s 
functions, creating distressing characteristics in 
the elderly such as memory loss and disorders 
like osteoporosis.
Without the endocrine system creating 
and secreting the many hormones that enter 
our bloodstream and ordering our organs 
and tissues to behave in a particular way, 
we wouldn’t be the fascinating and complex 
creatures that we are. So next time someone 
asks you why you’re being moody or why you 
need that extra hour in bed, you can answer 
truthfully... it’s my hormones.

The Master Gland
The pituitary gland is also known as the 
master gland since it oversees all other 
hormonal instructions. Hormones from 
the hypothalamus enter the hypophyseal 
portal, which connects the hypothalamus 
to the pituitary gland. A network of 
capillaries carry the hormones to the 
anterior lobe of the pituitary, where they start 
or stop the production of pituitary hormones.
These hormones stimulate various 
endocrine glands that control a multitude of 
bodily functions. The thyroid-stimulating 
hormone, for example, instigates parts of the

(ADH), controls water loss in the body, while 
oxytocin is vitally important during

as stressful events.

Glands of the 
Endocrine System
Eight major glands make up the endocrine system, 
and each one secretes a different hormone
Endocrine 
or Exocrine
While both the endocrine and exocrine systems 
produce and secrete hormones, the difference 
between them lies in the way they distribute 
hormones around the body. Unlike the endocrine 
system, the exocrine system doesn’t rely on the 
bloodstream to transport hormones. It works 
outside of the bloodstream, planting the 
hormones directly onto an epithelial surface. This 
might be the outer layer of the skin - known as the 
epidermis - the lining of your intestines or the 
lining of your respiratory tract. The exocrine system 
achieves this by delivering hormones via a duct. 
These ducts can come in many different shapes 
and sizes, from simple to tubular, and can be 
individual or clumped together.
C Non-Target 
M Cells M
Pineal
The pineal gland is located 
deep within the centre of the 
brain; its primary function 
is to secrete melatonin. This 
particular hormone helps 
you get to sleep easily 
and regulates a healthy 
circadian rhythm.

thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine 
(T3) and calcitonin. The most 
important is the T3 hormone, as 
it controls your growth and 
metabolism. Calcitonin allows 
calcium to be absorbed into our 
bones, making them stronger.
The hormone binds 
with the target cell, 
triggering a series of 
reactions that will 
alter the behaviour 
of that cell.

Islets of Langerhans 
cells create and release 
insulin, which acts to 
lower the blood sugar 
level, and glucagon, 
which raises blood 
sugar levels. In this 
way, glucose levels 
are maintained within 
the body.
The testes make the 
hormone testosterone in 
men, which instigates 
the growth of facial and 
body hair, develops a sex 
drive and helps in the 
creation of sperm.
6 Adrenal
Adrenal glands, which 
are found at the tops of 
your kidneys, make vitally 
important hormones 
including epinephrine, 
cortisol, noradrenaline 
and aldosterone. These 
affect many bodily 
functions, including your 
oxygen intake, blood 
pressure and stress 
reactions. They also 
produce reproductive 
hormones.
4 Thymus
Various hormones 
are made here: the 
thymopoietin, thymosin 
and thymulin help in the 
production of T-cells, 
while the thymic 
humoral factor supports 
the immune system. 
When enough T-cells 
have been produced, the 
gland begins to wither 
and is replaced with fat.
8 Ovaries
The ovaries create and secrete the hormones 
oestrogen and progesterone in women, which 
help start the menstrual cycle and develop 
breasts at puberty. These hormones are 
also vitally important during pregnancy.

Imbalances and disorders
The endocrine system plays a vital role in regulating biological 
functions. Any imbalance of hormones can have catastrophic 
results, leading to a variety of disorders
Diabetes
Diabetes occurs when the body is unable 
to produce the hormone insulin or use it 
effectively. This can lead to dangerously high 
blood sugar levels. Diabetes can occur in two 
forms: type 1 is an autoimmune condition that 
tends to develop in childhood or teen years. The 
body’s immune system attacks cells in the 
pancreas, stopping the production of insulin. With 
type 2 diabetes, the body becomes resistant to 
insulin, causing a spike in blood sugar levels. 
Unlike type 1 diabetes, type 2 tends to occur in 
adults and can sometimes be brought about by 
eating too many sugary foods. Both type 1 and 
type 2 can be caused by a combination of 
genetic and environmental factors. Symptoms 
can include feeling exceptionally thirsty, having 
blurry vision, needing to urinate more frequently 
and feeling exhausted all the time. Long-term 
complications of diabetes can include 
cardiovascular disease and kidney damage.
Pituitary 
Gigantism
This occurs when the pituitary gland produces 
far too much growth hormone in children before 
their bone growth plates fuse together. Muscle 
and organ size and height increase 
exponentially, causing the child to become 
abnormally big for their age. It can also cause 
many other symptoms, including excessive 
sweating and double vision.
Addison’s 
Disease
This occurs when the adrenal glands fail 
to produce the required amounts of the 
hormones cortisol and aldosterone. For this 
reason it is also known as primary adrenal 
insufficiency. The symptoms include low blood 
pressure, muscle weakness and overwhelming 
tiredness. Addison’s disease can be caused by 
any damage to the adrenal glands.
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
Scientists aren’t sure of the exact cause of polycystic ovary 
syndrome, but they have noticed a correlation between women who 
suffer with the disease and an increase in the hormone insulin. Some 
women create more insulin than is necessary because their bodies 
are resistant to it. This instigates an increase in another hormone, 
testosterone. When this occurs, the patient may suffer from excessive 
facial hair and weight gain, and may also find it very difficult to fall 
pregnant. This is due to infrequent ovulation cycles, and sometimes 
the body can stop ovulating altogether.

Hyperthyroidism occurs when the thyroid gland

The thyroid becomes overactive, and this 
causes the person to be overly nervous with an 
increased heart rate. They tend to lose

Hypothyroidism, on the other hand, occurs when 
the thyroid gland is underactive. The body 
becomes sluggish and the gland produces too 
little of the thyroid hormone. The patient 
becomes extremely tired and other bodily 
functions slow down. For example, they can suffer 
from intestinal issues such as severe constipation. 
The skin can become very dry and patients will

adrenal glands via the 
bloodstream. The ACTH

Your immune
system explained
Meet the cells and organs that make up your 
immune system. Discover how it keeps deadly invaders 
at bay and what happens when it gets out of control
very day your immune system 
is working tirelessly to fend off 
harmful invading pathogens 
such as bacteria and viruses. 
Our understanding of the 
immune system began in the 
late-19th century when Russian zoologist Elie 
Metchnikoff identified a group of white blood 
cells called phagocytes, whose purpose is to seek 
out, engulf and eliminate pathogens. During the 
same period, the discovery of antibodies and 
their role in neutralising pathogens also came 
to fight thanks to German physiologists Emil 
Behring and Paul Ehrlich. Since then, scientists 
from around the world have come to understand 
the complexity of our immune system and the
many ways it has evolved to fight off bacterial 
baddies and villainous viruses.
Part of our immune system is passed on to 
us as newborns from our mothers through the 
placenta during our time spent in the womb, 
and again through feeding on breast milk. 
Immunity to particular viruses and bacteria 
and the potency of this passive immunity differs 
from mother to mother. For example, mothers 
who have had chickenpox during their lifetime 
can pass on that immunity to their newborn. 
However, this form of passive protection is short­
lived and begins to decrease after the first few 
months of life. Over time, the immune system 
acquires more complex immunities after reacting 
with pathogens from the outside world.

know?
You produce more

such as the skin, has been broken and there’s 
a potential threat of invasion from outside 
pathogens, white blood cells called mast cells, 
which are found in the connective tissue near 
blood vessels, release histamine into the blood 
to initiate the body’s inflammatory response.
The first soldiers to battle pathogens are a 
group of white blood cells called phagocytes. 
The most abundant phagocytes in the human 
body are called neutrophils, which gobble 
up pathogens on sight. Once a pathogen is 
devoured, the neutrophil essentially self- 
destructs in a process called apoptosis, 
killing the pathogen in the process. During 
infection, the bodies of self-destructed 
neutrophils pile up and form pus at the site of 
a wound.
4 Tonsils
A collection of lymphocytes can be 
found in the tonsils. These cells are one

the body. Then there’s mucus. Snot
acts like quicksand for pathogens, which 
become stuck and are prevented from making 
it any further into the body. For those sneaky 
pathogens that make it past these first two 
lines of defence, they might find their way into 
the stomach, which is filled with acid that kills 
them off. Also, the digestive system is home to 
healthy bacteria that compete with invading 
bacteria for space and food, sometimes leading 
to the demise of the invading bacteria.
If a pathogen makes it past these physical 
barriers, then a secondary internal defence is

Herd immunity
During the height of the coronavirus 
pandemic, you might have heard the term 
‘herd immunity’ being used. This form of 
immunity occurs when the majority of a 
population, or ‘the herd’, is immune to a 
particular infectious disease. At the point at 
which the herd is predominantly immune, 
the disease is less likely to spread. For 
example, if a person infected with highly 
contagious measles were to stand in the 
centre of a group of vaccinated people, the 
disease would be unable to be transmitted 
and would eventually disappear. This type 
of immunity also helps those that are unable 
to be vaccinated, such as newborns and 
the elderly.
For herd immunity to be effective, the 
people vaccinated or immune to the disease 
need to outnumber the rate at which the 
disease can spread. Measles, for example, 
can spread at such a rapid rate that 19 out 
of 20 people need to be vaccinated for herd 
immunity to be achieved.
For herd immunity to work, the majority of the 
population needs to be vaccinated

YOUR IMMUNE 
SYSTEM EXPLAINED
© Getty / Illustration by Adrian Mann
Outside of the bloodstream, larger phagocytes 
called macrophages also engulf pathogens, but 
can be found free-flowing through tissue or 
embedded into tissues such as the lymph nodes 
or intestinal tract. If the war against pathogens 
isn’t going in the phagocytes’ favour, they can 
release chemicals into the blood called pyrogens 
to trigger a fever. Once the pyrogens reach the 
brain’s hypothalamus, they cause it to raise 
the body’s temperature, giving your immune 
cells a metabolic boost for battle but 
inducing stress in pathogens.
In the event that these innate 
defences can’t completely fend 
off pathogens, the second division 
of the immune system, known as 
adaptive or active immunity, kicks 
into gear. In this system, a legion of white 
blood cells called lymphocytes work together 
to seek out and destroy pathogens that enter 
the bloodstream. The key elements in the active 
immune system are antigens and antibodies. 
Antigens are like the identification cards for 
pathogens and antibodies are like pathogen 
mugshots. When the two are compared and 
a positive match is found, immune cells are 
altered and the elimination process begins.
Sometimes the volume of invading bacteria 
can overwhelm the body’s immune system and 
it can’t produce enough immune cells to fight 
off a serious infection, such as pneumonia. 
In this case, the immune system may need 
a helping hand from medication, called 
antibiotics, to eradicate bacterial pathogens. 
Antiviral medication also works to limit the 
infectious abilities of some invading viruses, 
giving the immune system a chance to 
defeat them.
Similarly, vaccines are used to 
stimulate our natural immune 
response against specific pathogen 
threats. Vaccines work by releasing 
proteins called antigens into the 
body, which the immune system 
recognises as foreign and a potential 
pathogen. The antigen in the vaccine will have 
the same proteins as that of the pathogen you’re 
vaccinating against, such as measles. This sets 
the active immune system into motion, creating 
antibodies to fight a potential infection. The 
immune system will store or ‘remember’ the 
antibodies it needs in case of a future infection. 
Many vaccines are administered yearly to keep 
the system primed for defence.

Damaged 
nerves
Sometimes the human immune system 
misinterprets healthy tissue as invading 
pathogens and sets out to remove it. In a 
typical immune response, T cells release 
cytokines that instruct other immune cells 
when and where to attack and when 
to fall back. But sometimes this cellular 
communication goes wrong and the 
immune cells can’t correctly identify 
what’s a pathogen and what’s healthy 
tissue, which leads to the development of 
autoimmune diseases such as lupus and 
rheumatoid arthritis.
There are more than 100 known 
autoimmune diseases, some more serious 
than others. Multiple sclerosis, for example, 
is a chronic disease of the central nervous 
system caused by an autoimmune 
response. Instead of solely fighting invading 
pathogens, immune cells attach to nerve 
cells and prevent them from sending 
electrical signals to and from the brain. 
It’s still unclear why autoimmune diseases 
develop and what causes the immune 
system to stop recognising healthy tissue. 
However, scientists have made some 
connections between autoimmune diseases 
and possible triggers, such as an immune 
response to an infection like strep throat 
that can lead to the development of an 
autoimmune disease like psoriasis.
Injury or damage to a part of the body 
may also trigger the development of 
a disease such as psoriatic arthritis, 
which affects the joints. Along with some 
environmental factors, genetics may also 
play a pivotal role in the development of 
some autoimmune diseases.

Immunity myths
Sheena Cruickshank, an immunologist and a 
professor of biomedical sciences and public 
engagement at the university of Manchester, 
separates immunity facts from fiction
Does stress lower your immune response?
Chronic stress does, so the longer you’re 
stressed, it absolutely does. I think a 
short, sharp stress isn’t damaging for your 
immune system. Some people suggest it 
might give you a little transient boost. 
But chronic stress, if you stress for a long 
period of time, does impede the actions of 
immune cells.
Does immunity weaken with age?
Yes, unfortunately it does. As we get older, 
the majority of us will see a decline in our 
immune function. We may have fewer of 
the specialised white blood cells called 
lymphocytes that are there to deal with 
infection. However, it’s not always as 
severe in some older people; some older 
people do age well. And one thing that 
might be linked to that is having a good, 
diverse microbiome. It helps maintain the 
barrier in your gut, and that stops you 
getting kind of a leaky gut and getting this 
low-level inflammation that can happen 
when you’re older, and that can further 
make your immune system a bit off.

Does vitamin C boost the immune system? 
The evidence for that is rather mixed. A 
healthy diet is important for an optimal 
immune system. But studies on vitamin 
C have been really mixed. There’s not a 
really clear link with vitamin C per se.
The exception is vitamin D. A lot of people 
can be vitamin D deficient, particularly 
in the winter months when we get less 
sunlight. And you have to eat quite a lot 
of particular food types to really try and 
enrich that in your diet. And people who 
have low vitamin D do seem to be a bit 
more susceptible to catching colds.
Is the idea of being able to boost your 
immune system a myth?
There is one way that you can truly boost 
your immune system, and that’s having a 
vaccine. I mean, that’s what a vaccine is 
doing - it’s boosting your immunity to stop 
you getting sick in response to a particular 
infection. But the idea that we can boost 
our general immunity is a myth. For 
most of us, our immune system is 
doing a pretty good job. I mean, 
we’re exposed to infections and 
nasty germs every day, and most 
of the time we don’t get ill.
Did you 
know?
The thymus shrinks 
at a rate of three 
per cent per year 
until middle age
Does sleep have any impact on our 
immune system?
It’s important to have sleep for our 
immune systems, like all sorts of cells in 
our body. Pretty much all the cells in the 
body have little circadian clocks and they 
help kind of optimise our function, so lack 
of sleep can throw those out, and it can 
definitely affect your immune response. 
And we know it ourselves. If we’ve been 
going through a phase or we’ve not been 
sleeping well and we’ve been stressed or 
we’ve not been eating well, then we do 
often get run down; we’ll often get that 
horrible infection taking hold.
Does exercise lower your immune system? 
Now, it all depends how you exercise. 
Moderate exercise is a benefit for your 
immune system, so moderate levels of 
activity, that’s kind of what the NHS is 
recommending. Three or four bursts of 
moderate kinds of exercise where you can 
really feel your heart starting to get going. 
The 10,000 steps a day was thought to be a 
bit of a kind of random figure, but actually 
it’s been assessed since, and that does look 
like a good thing to aim for. So all of these 
things seem to be good at mobilising your 
immune system, helping it operate better, 
detect infection, deal with infections better, 
and you seem to have a lower risk of upper 
respiratory tract infections, like colds. 
But if you do extreme sports and you’re 
absolutely not used to it, that puts 
your body under stress and that 
is not so good for your immune 
system. It’s that balance, and 
also how acclimatised you are 
too.
What’s a common myth you often 
debunk?
One of the things that really worries me 
that I’m seeing a lot more of at the moment 
is this idea that it’s good for children 
to get infected and build their immune 
system. I don’t really understand where 
that narrative has come from. Actually, 
we know that children under the age of 
five are some of the most vulnerable to 
infection.

HUMAN BIOLOGY
How babies 
are made
The fusion of sex cells that begins 
the great journey of pregnancy
64

HOW BABIES
ARE MADE
umans reproduce by sexual 
H reproduction. This mixes the 
genetic information of two 
people. For this to happen 
we have evolved specialised 
sex cells, known as gametes, 
that are specific to each sex. Females produce 
and carry egg cells that, much like their vastly 
larger avian equivalents, contain both genetic 
information and form the nexus of an embryo. 
Females also have a dedicated sex organ called 
a uterus, which nurtures the embryo during its 
development. Males provide the other half of the 
genetic information by producing sperm cells.
Both the egg and sperm hold instructions 
encoded by deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which 
contains all the information needed to form 
a functional human body. The cells’ DNA is 
wrapped up tightly into large structures called 
chromosomes. Both the egg cell and the sperm 
cell carry 23 chromosomes, which once aligned 
in an embryo will form 23 pairs that will be 
carried by every somatic cell in a mature 
human body. Two of these chromosomes form a 
pair known as sex chromosomes, as they define 
the sex of the baby during development. Every 
egg cell carries an X chromosome, and a sperm 
cell can carry either an X or a Y chromosome. 
Females are encoded by a combination of XX, 
and males by a combination of XY. Our genetic 
sex is sealed the very moment our two sets of 
chromosomes meet during fertilisation.
Fertilisation can begin once an egg is released 
by a follicle in the ovaries, a step that occurs 
periodically in women of fertile age. Throughout 
this cycle, stages of hormones trigger the release 
of an egg, which in turn triggers more signals 
intended for the wall of the uterus, which 
thickens in expectation of a fertilised embryo to 
implant in its surface. This offers a brief window 
of time for legions of sperm to be released 
from a male’s testicles and undertake the long, 
arduous journey through a female’s uterus to 
reach the egg while it is viable.
The fusion between a sperm and egg 
cell’s DNA marks the beginning of embryo 
development, and once it has found its home 
in the nourishing lining of the uterine wall, the 
embryo undergoes a monumental growth spurt. 
It transforms from a mere bundle of cells into a 
foetus, acquiring a heart, brain, jaw, fingers and 
toes. Within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy 
the foetus boasts a full complement of organs. 
This incredible metamorphosis is guided on a 
cellular level by genetic instructions encoded 
within the DNA and by external environmental 
signals. These signals tell the cells how to 
interact with one another, where to migrate, 
how to divide and when to die to make way for 
new cells. This allows a swarm of microscopic 
cells to differentiate and develop into 
something not only gargantuan in size but also 
in complexity: a fully formed human baby.
A sperm cell must pass a thick membrane 
encasing the egg, known as a zona pellucida,

Fertilisation
A fertilised cell with a full complement 
of 23 pairs of chromosomes forms a 
zygote, which migrates through the 
fallopian tube towards the uterus.
As the fertilised cell migrates 
towards the uterus it undergoes 
cleavage, dividing from a single 
cell into a connected cluster of 
cells called blastomeres.
The berry-like configuration of 
blastomeres continues to 
divide, becoming a morula. 
During these latter divisions the 
cells commit to becoming 
either the embryo or placenta.

he process of fertilisation and embryo 
implantation is a wonderfully elegant yet 
complex process. This complexity, however, 
presents numerous opportunities for natural 
obstacles and barriers that prevent natural 
conception. Such obstacles include damage 
or blockage of the fallopian tubes, which can prevent the 
sperm and egg meeting or the fertilised egg from reaching 
the uterus. Other disorders affect the release of eggs from the 
ovaries, and others affect males by reducing sperm number 
and activity. These challenges have driven the development 
of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), which offers a human-made 
bridge to pregnancy when the natural path is blocked. IVF 
is a process whereby the act of fertilisation, initial embryo 
division and implantation are conducted in the laboratory 
under the guidance of scientists.
Sperm injection
Males with semen that contains millions of 
healthy and active sperm cells per millilitre 
are often able to achieve fertilisation 
organically. But semen harbouring a low 
sperm count, irregular-shaped sperm or 
sperm that aren’t particularly mobile can 
find it difficult, or even impossible. Sperm 
injection provides an alternative means to 
achieve fertilisation. Clinicians can use 
micropipettes to hold the egg in place and 
directly inject sperm cells into the egg using 
a micro-sized needle, allowing the sperm 
cell to reach its goal.

Lesley Brown the opportunity - albeit 
one with a slim chance of success 
- to artificially fertilise her eggs with 
her husband’s sperm. Without the use 
of hormones to manipulate her 
natural menstrual cycle and increase 
egg production, the scientists 
overcame the odds and successfully 
performed the first in vitro fertilisation 
and implantation of a single 
lab-fertilised embryo.

HOW BABIES
ARE MADE
One baby, three parents
How doctors can use different genetic material
uclear DNA resides inside 
Nthe nucleus of our cells. This
DNA is huge, composed of 
reams of instructions 3.3 
billion base pairs in length. 
Nuclear DNA comes from 
both our mother and father and is responsible 
for the vast majority of characteristics we 
display as we develop. However, our cells 
also host a small chunk of independent DNA 
that lives inside cellular components called 
mitochondria, which are energy-producing 
factories that power our cells. Mitochondrial 
DNA comes solely from our mother and is 
inherited from the fertilised egg cell at the 
beginning of gestation.
Mitochondrial DNA is miniscule in length 
compared to its nuclear counterpart, measuring 
around 16,500 base pairs in length, and 
contains instructions only for the function 
of mitochondria. In rare cases a mother can 
harbour a catastrophic mutation in this DNA 
that prevents healthy embryos developing. 
To circumvent this problem, scientists 
have developed a technique that combines 
nuclear DNA from two genetic parents with 
mitochondrial DNA from a donor. This removes 
the risk of inheriting mitochondrial diseases 
and means that the birthed baby will forever 
carry DNA from three people.
Room for one more
If diseased mitochondria are 
transferred with the pronuclei, the

Cloning
The egg cell is essential, 
designed to ensure that the 
encoded DNA in the nucleus 
develops into an embryo. But 
scientists wondered if the egg 
could only drive the embryonic 
development of DNA from both 
parents, or if it could transform 
any nuclear DNA into an embryo. 
In the 1960s they started to find 
out. Beginning with frog cells, as 
they’re large and easier to 
manipulate, scientists removed 
the nuclear DNA from a fertilised 
egg and replaced it with nuclear 
DNA from an intestinal cell of an 
adult frog. After around 40 days, 
the result was a tadpole that was 
genetically identical to the frog 
that had donated the intestinal 
cell, as all the nuclear DNA had 
come from one animal.
The science of stem cells
Dolly the sheep was the first 
mammal successfully cloned
fertilised embryo that 
nestles into the uterine wall 
holds mammoth amounts of 
potential. The cells destined 
to become a foetus at that 
moment all look alike and 
number in the mere hundreds. Yet the organism 
that will arise from this small enclave will one 
day boast trillions of cells and be composed of 
a plethora of specialist cell types. How can the 
multitude of different cell types that make up 
our eyes, brain, lungs and skin come from such 
a small number of similar cells? The answer 
to this exponential increase in complexity and 
specialisation comes from stem cells.
Every cell in the human body contains all 
the genetic information needed to perform any 
role. But for our bodies to develop and function 
efficiently, we need skin cells to behave like 
skin, and for muscles to behave like muscles. 
For this to happen our cells become specialised, 
or differentiated, into particular cell types, 
meaning they only use a part of the genetic 
information available in their DNA.
However, all cell types begin their existence 
as stem cells, undifferentiated cells that have 
the potential to become many different cell 
types. Embryonic stem cells are there at the 
origin of our developmental journey. As the
embryo grows and develops into a foetus, 
chemical signals received by the stem cells 
begin their journey of differentiation, sealing 
their fate to become certain cells by silencing 
and unlocking specific parts of their DNA.
The malleable power of stem cells also 
represents remarkable opportunities for those 
who can harness them. As well as being able 
to recover embryonic stem cells from early

we can even utilise stem cells to generate egg

Gestation begins
The once-specialised cell has become part 
of a fertilised embryo, which is implanted 
into a donor for gestation.
“One key benefit of cloning is that it 
allows you to introduce specific traits 
over just one generation. A desired trait 
may be caused by a specific DNA 
change and only be naturally present in 
one breed of cattle and lacking in 
another. However, we can design clones 
so that they have attributes from both 
breeds. For example, horn growth in 
dairy cattle can be a danger to other 
animals and those that care for the
animals. To induce a lack of horns 
through a genetic path, you’d usually 
need to go through multiple 
generations of breeding, but 
alternatively we can edit the gene in 
cells prior to cloning to get this trait 
immediately. This helps to improve 
animal welfare as we can avoid farming 
practices like the dehorning procedure, 
which is when a calf’s horn buds are 
burned to prevent them growing.”
One of the main proteins responsible for limb 
patterns and growth is known as the Sonic 
hedgehog (SHH) protein. For SHH to work 
correctly, it has to come on for exactly the right 
amount of time and have exactly the right 
amount of activity. If you lose the activity of this 
protein, embryos develop with unusual 
differences. Too much can cause too many 
fingers to form; too little and things like cyclopia, 
where the eyes don’t part and the nose doesn’t 
develop properly, can occur. Another important 
protein is TALPID3, which affects the activity of 
centrosomes, cellular structures that are 
important for cell division. When the cell is not 
dividing, the centrosome migrates up to the cell 
surface and docks onto the cell membrane. Cells 
use centrosomes as their compass, but cells that 
lack the TALPID3 protein lose their spatial 
awareness. Centrosomes in these cells continue 
to migrate, but they don’t migrate in the right 
direction. Instead they move all over. This means 
that cells can end up growing the wrong way.
Could investigating stem cell activity lead to 
any medical applications?
We currently don’t know how to regenerate 
fingers, and we don’t know if there’s a stem cell 
for regenerating fingers. My hypothesis is that 
embryos may have stem cells at the tips of their 
growing digits. We’re currently investigating 
useful genetic tools in chickens, and one that 
we’re developing is called the Brainbow chicken, 
which allows us to visually mark cells and see 
where they go during development. We can use 
this to label the cells found at the end of the 
digits and see if they behave like stem cells, 
allowing us to learn more about how to 
regenerate fingers.

he process of pasteurisation 
Tis a centuries-old method 
of preparing food, giving 
it a longer life in larders 
and today on supermarket 
shelves. Since the 11th century, 
people have been using heat to battle against 
microorganisms to preserve their food. Ancient 
Chinese wine makers used hot clay jars to 
heat wine before burying them in cool soil to 
preserve them. However, it wasn’t until the
late-19th century that a name was attributed to 
this process.
Pasteurisation is used to combat the harmful 
pathogens that reside within raw foods, 
often referred to as spoilage microorganisms. 
These can be transferred to our bodies when 
we consume these foods in their raw state. 
Pathogens such as E. coli and Salmonella can 
be found in raw milk, and when ingested can 
cause serious health issues. To destroy and 
remove harmful pathogens from certain foods, 
such as milk, it’s heated to high temperatures 
below 100 degrees Celsius. The heat denatures 
and breaks down the proteins and enzymes 
within the pathogens, killing them and allowing 
humans to consume it without the risk to their 
health. Once a food has been heated, it’s then 
cooled down and stored. Storing pasteurised 
products in cold conditions like a fridge creates 
an environment where microorganisms are 
unable to reproduce and grow, which would 
effectively undo the job of pasteurisation.

The great 
experiment
How the inventor of 
pasteurisation made 
his discovery
Pasteur the pioneer
The word ‘pasteurisation’ comes from the man 
who discovered it in 1865. Louis Pasteur, a French 
chemist and microbiologist, invented and 
patented the process after studying the science 
behind fermentation and attempting to tackle 
the ‘disease’ of wine, which was destroying 
vineyards in France. Having discovered a 
microbe that converts alcohol into vinegar, 
called Myoderma aceti, and publishing his 
‘germ theory’ in 1861, Pasteur was tasked by
Napoleon III to understand the disease that was 
turning wine into vinegar. By experimenting with 
foods that had been exposed to the air 
following a period of heating and those that had 
not, Pasteur theorised that germs in the air were 
responsible for the spoilage of certain foods 
and wine. He discovered that heating wine to a 
temperature above 55 degrees Celsius killed 
microorganisms and extended the wine’s life 
before it spoiled.

This process doesn’t completely sterilise the 
food product, but does remove enough of the 
spoilage microorganisms that it’s safe to eat 
and extends its life span. Other than killing 
harmful pathogens, studies have found that 
pasteurisation can slightly change the vitamin 
concentration in some products. In milk the 
process increases the concentration of vitamin 
A but decreases the levels of vitamin B12 and 
E. Some forms of pasteurisation occur long 
before the food has even been made, such as 
in eggs. In 2017, the Food Standards Agency 
updated its advice around eggs, allowing the 
consumption of raw eggs or slightly cooked 
eggs produced under British Lion Code. Eggs 
produced under this code come from chickens 
that have been vaccinated against Salmonella, 
therefore reducing the risk of transferring the

bacteria. Eggs produced outside of the Lion 
Code are not suitable for raw eating and should 
be completely cooked before consuming.
While a majority of foods, such as milk, 
cheese, nuts and wine, are pasteurised and safe 
to consume, there are alternatives made from 
Eggs in the United States being pasteurised to remove 
potential Salmonella
unpasteurised products that are safe to eat. 
Many soft cheeses are made with unpasteurised 
or raw milk, but instead of undergoing 
pasteurisation, this type of cheese is required 
to be aged at a constant temperature to 
stunt the growth of harmful bacteria. 
In Canada the law requires cheese to 
be aged for at least 60 days at two 
degrees Celsius before it can be sold.
Typically, the process of 
pasteurisation requires a constant

the growth of spoilage microorganisms, but 
that’s not always the case. Milk that sits in 
cartons unrefrigerated is known as ultra-high 
temperature (UHT) milk. This extreme version 
of pasteurisation involves rapidly heating the 
milk to temperatures of at least 135 degrees 
Celsius and then rapidly cooling it to room
temperature. This process kills all of the 
pathogens in the milk, essentially sterilising 
it, and is packaged in an aseptic container to 
prevent the growth of any new bacteria. The 
treated milk can then be stored without 
the need for refrigeration and can 
last for months. Although traditional 
methods of pasteurisation remain the 
predominant way that dairy products 
and other perishables are treated, 
there are emerging non-heat processes, 
Lich as High Pressure Processing (HPP) 
and Pulsed Electric Fields (PEF), that are 
being explored as an alternative option. PEF 
foods at ambient temperatures are exposed to 
pulsing electric fields that neutralise spoilage 
microorganisms, whereas HPP uses extreme 
pressure to make spoilage microorganisms 
inactive and extend the product’s shelf life.

Making milk The stages that make milk safe to drink
1
 Milking
A single dairy cow can produce 
around 28 litres of milk per day, 
which is extracted 
via vacuum cups attached 
to the udders.
2
 Temperature
Milk is typically heated to 
around 74 degrees Celsius 
for 20 seconds.
Pasteurisation
Milk-filled pipes are surrounded 
by water at two different 
temperatures - one to heat the milk 
and the other to cool it back down 
to four degrees Celsius.
4
 Destruction
The proteins and enzymes in 
spoilage icroorganisms are 
denatured and broken down, 
ultimately killing them.
5
 Separation
Milk is spun to separate and 
remove fat to make the variety of 
milks on store shelves, such as 
semi-skimmed.
6
 Homogenisation
Pressure is applied to the milk to 
prevent cream separation and to 
blend the mixture together.
7
 Storage
Pasteurised milk is transported 
and stored at five degrees Celsius 
or less.
8
 Bottling
Pasteurised milk is packaged 
into sterilised bottles or cartons and 
stamped with an expiry date of up 
to two weeks.

How bleach kills germs
This cleaning cupboard staple tears through proteins, 
destroying bacteria and viruses in minutes
ousehold bleach is a 
H bactericide; it kills bacteria 
on contact. It’s one of the 
cheapest and most powerful 
microbe busters on the 
planet. But how does it 
work? The bleach under your sink is a solution 
of sodium hypochlorite, which has the chemical 
formula NaClO. That means that each molecule 
contains one sodium atom, one chlorine atom 
and one oxygen atom. In water it produces 
hypochlorous acid (HOC1), which can steal 
electrons from other molecules. It uses this 
ability to attack bacteria and viruses, breaking 
their proteins apart and splitting them open.
Hypochlorous acid also damages pigment 
molecules, turning them white, which is where 
bleach gets its name from. In its pure form, 
bleach is extremely corrosive. It has a pH of 13, 
making it just about as alkaline as you can get. 
Luckily, the bottle under your sink also contains 
water, lowering the pH to a slightly safer 11.
It doesn’t take much bleach to completely 
sterilise a surface. Your bottle at home is only 
five per cent bleach, and you need to dilute it 
even further before you can use it safely. You 
only need 15 millilitres in 3.8 litres of water 
to sterilise a table that has been in contact 
with dirty water. To kill mould, you need a bit 
more - 240 millilitres in 3.8 litres. Bleach is so 
reactive that you have to use it within 24 hours 
of mixing it up or it won’t be nearly as effective. 
It breaks down rapidly into salt and water, 
especially if it’s warm, making it a much less
powerful microbe killer. To keep it working at 
its best, store it in a cool, dark cupboard and 
only dilute just as much as you need to get the 
job done.
It takes between 10 and 60 minutes 
for bleach to kill germs

HOW BLEACH 
KILLS GERMS
How is bleach made?
leach is an industrial chemical, 
and it’s produced on an 
industrial scale. It involves 
two methods: the chlor-alkali 
process and the Hooker 
process. The chlor-alkali 
process produces the raw materials for bleach 
production: sodium hydroxide, also known as 
caustic soda or lye, and chlorine gas. It begins 
with salty water, also known as brine. The 
chlor-alkali process uses a technique called
electrolysis to break the chemicals in brine 
apart and remake them into something new. 
When a current passes through the liquid, it 
turns water (H2O) and salt (NaCl) into sodium 
hydroxide (NaOH), chlorine (C12) and hydrogen 
(H2). Two of these three ingredients go on to the 
next stage, the Hooker process. In the Hooker 
process, the sodium hydroxide is cooled and the 
chlorine gas is bubbled through. This produces 
NaClO, also known as sodium hypochlorite, the 
active ingredient in household bleach.

Lab-grown 
meat explained
Would you eat chicken or beef that’s been 
grown in a laboratory?
Mammoth meatballs
ould lab-grown meat be 
the compromise that settles 
the conflict between meat­
eaters and vegetarians? 
For more than 2.5 million 
years humans have eaten 
the flesh of other animals. During this time, 
the world’s agriculture industry has boomed, 
with 26 per cent of Earth’s ice-free land 
dedicated to livestock, which comes 
at a cost to the environment. On 
average, the livestock industry is 
responsible for around 18 per cent 
of global greenhouse gas emissions. 
To help minimise environmental 
impact and reduce the space needed
to house livestock, scientists have started 
growing food far from the fields, inside their 
laboratories. Scientists care for a collection of 
tiny cells that have been extracted from the 
genuine article without the need to slaughter 
a living animal.
A small sample of stem cells, typically 
taken from animal muscle via a small biopsy 
under local anaesthetic, is collected and
1.5 billion cows 
are eaten 
globally each 
year
placed in a culture to grow. Stem cells act like 
the understudies of the body’s other cells: 
when stimulated, stem cells can develop into 
specialised cell types, such as muscle and fat 
cells. To grow meat, which is essentially a 
collection of fat and muscle cells, scientists 
expose the extracted stem cells to amino acids 
and carbohydrates that trigger their ability to 
change. The changing stem cells are left 
to grow and multiply until a heap of 
muscle fibres has developed and the
| new meat is plentiful enough to use 
in meat products, such as burgers.
So far, only a handful of animal 
species have had their cells turned into
this novel form of meat, including cows, 
chickens and pigs. However, some companies 
plan to expand into more exotic meats, such 
as kangaroo, alligator and ostrich. Currently, 
lab-grown meat isn’t widely available. The 
first country to allow the sale of cultured meat 
was Singapore in 2020. In 2023, American 
companies such as the San Francisco start-up 
Upside Foods were given the green light to sell 
their cultured meat products in the US.
So far, lab-grown meat has been limited to 
cows, chickens and pigs. But what if you 
could feast on the meat of animals long 
extinct, like the mighty mammoth? An 
Australian company called Vow has done 
just that. Combining the DNA of the extinct 
woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) 
and its closest living relative, the African 
elephant (Loxodonta), Vow served up the 
first mammoth meatball in March 2023. 
Although the meatball looked tasty enough 
to eat, it’s yet to pass anyone’s lips. Fears 
over the safety of the meat and the possible 
negative immune response of the human 
body mean that the taste of mammoth 
meat remains a mystery.

Churchill’s prediction
The concept of cultured meat isn’t a new 
idea; it’s not even one dreamt up in this 
century. Years before he faced one of 
the most significant wars in history, UK 
prime minister Winston Churchill was 
known for writing predictive essays on 
the state of humankind. In one such 
essay, entitled Fifty Years Hence, which 
was published in The Strand Magazine in 
1931, Churchill predicted that as 
scientific understanding grew, we may 
no longer need the whole animal, only

growing parts for food. In the essay, he 
writes: “With a greater knowledge of 
what are called hormones, the chemical 
messengers in our blood, it will be 
possible to control growth. We shall 
escape the absurdity of growing a 
whole chicken to eat the breast or wing 
by growing these parts separately under 
a suitable medium.”
It took 82 years, but in 2013 the first 
lab-grown meat product, a burger, was 
created by scientists in the Netherlands.

 Best of the bunch
Of the extracted cells, 
these are the cells that 
are best at producing 
high-quality meat.
The cells are placed 
into a bioreactor, where 
they are fed nutrients and 
water so that they start to 
grow and multiply.

 Transformation
While in the 
bioreactor, stem cells 
differentiate (transform 
into different specialised 
cells) into muscle cells 
called myofibres.
5
 Scaffolding
Myofibres are 
transferred to structural 
scaffolding, typically 
made from collagen or 
gelatin, to grow into larger 
muscle fibres and form 
meat tissue.

The first person to measure and name a 
nanoparticle was Richard Zsigmondy. Awarded 
the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1925 for his 
efforts, he was fascinated by ceramics and 
glass. Their stunning colours were the

1950s that people started to experiment 
with using nanoparticles like these in 
different ways. During the Cold War, another 
Nobel Prize winner, Richard Feynman, was 
investigating the possibility of science on an 
atomic scale. He published a paper entitled 
There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom, inviting 
scientists to enter a new field of physics. 
Feynman wanted to miniaturise computers and 
create machines that could assemble molecules 
atom by atom. And he dreamed of a day when 
you could ‘swallow your surgeon’, delivering a 
life-saving robot into your body.
His ideas might sound like science fiction, 
but nature had already proven they were

millions of molecules, each measuring just 
fractions of a millimetre across. These particles 
can perform both mechanical and chemical 
work; they self-assemble and self-heal, and 
they also store and exchange information. 
They are nature’s nanomachines - all we have 
to do is recreate them.
In the 1980s, two powerful new microscopes 
revealed the nanoworld in all its minute detail. 
The scanning tunnelling microscope used a 
very fine wire and an electric current to map

that people started

even the thinnest of materials. At nanoscale, 
electrons behave like waves, allowing them to 
pass through solid objects using a technique 
called tunnelling.
The atomic force microscope worked in a 
similar way, but used a silicone tip and a laser 
to trace the surface of a sample. It could tell 
researchers about the magnetic, electrical, 
chemical and physical properties of materials they 
could never hope to see with their own eyes.
By the 1990s the field had exploded. 
Researchers observed carbon nanotubes for the 
first time - just a single atom thick, they were 
stronger than steel. In the years that followed, 
scientists developed the ability to fold DNA like 
paper, and they discovered that it was possible 
to guide nanoparticles inside the body like 
homing missiles. Now, with science advancing 
at lightning speed, Feynman’s dreams are closer 
than ever.

Introducing 
nanobots
Nanobots are robots on a molecular scale. Smaller 
than a grain of sand, these programmable particles 
take inspiration from biology. Inside every living cell 
are tiny machines that are surprisingly like the 
machines we use in our everyday lives. There are 
pumps, motors, switches and even clocks, all 
working together to perform complex work in 
miniature. Researchers have taken inspiration from 
these machines to create brand-new technology 
from tiny component parts. Made from proteins, fat 
and even DNA, nanobots have the potential to 
perform tasks like delivering drugs, killing bacteria 
and inactivating toxins. Some of the most promising 
use a design pattern called DNA origami. Made from 
repeating units of genetic code, these tiny particles 
can self-assemble into geometric shapes. They can 
form hollow cubes, rod-like scaffolding and even 
gears. In the future, particles like these could 
recreate mechanical machines on a nanoscale.

in the mouth is difficult. There isn’t a lot of 
room to move around, and there are lots of 
vital tissues, nerves and blood vessels 
close together. In the future, nanobots 
could travel through the gums and deliver 
anaesthetic directly to an individual tooth, 
without the need for needles. They could 
use nanoparticles made from the bone 
mineral hydroxyapatite to repair cavities 
and jaw damage. And they could even 
destroy harmful bacteria. Future 
nanodentistry could also include high-tech

Magnetic nanobots
Magnetic nanoparticles respond to external 
magnetic fields. This makes it possible to guide them 
through space, opening the way for magnet-driven 
nanobots. Researchers have found that applying 
different types of magnetic fields can make the tiny 
robots move in different ways. A rotating magnetic 
field can make a helical robot spin, winding forward 
like spring. An oscillating magnetic field can make a 
nanobot undulate, curling up and down like a fish. 
And a stepping magnetic field can make it stop and 
start like a switch, allowing a nanobot’s limbs to 
perform rowing movements. It’s also possible to 
combine magnetic control with other types of input, 
like light or ultrasound. This could one day allow 
much finer control of a nanobot’s movement, 
allowing it to perform highly complex and extremely 
delicate tasks, like surgery.
DNA-sized transistors like those on 
this silicon wafer could one day

Ultra-powerful computers
Computers think in zeros and ones. They contain 
millions of tiny switches, called transistors, that can be 
either on (one) or off (zero). The more transistors a 
computer has, the faster it can think. For the past few 
decades, engineers have been working hard to 
make this technology as small as possible. As a 
result, the number of transistors that can fit on a 
computer chip has roughly doubled every two years 
- a phenomenon known as Moore’s law. Your 
average computer now contains transistors no bigger 
than 14 nanometres across, while the most advanced 
contain transistors that measure just seven 
nanometres. In 2022, IBM unveiled transistors that 
measure just two nanometres, thinner than a strand of 
DNA, making it possible to pack 50 billion onto a chip 
the size of your fingernail.
These carbon nanogears were developed by NASA’s 
Numerical Aerospace Simulation Systems Division
Fullerene machines
In 2016, three chemists received the Nobel Prize for 
developing the world’s smallest machines. They had 
invented chains, axles and motors on a molecular 
scale. These advances led to the development of 
the world’s first nanocar in 2005, a moving vehicle 
20,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair. 
The car had wheels made from buckyballs and axles 
that moved freely, allowing the whole structure to roll. 
By 2017, researchers were literally racing to develop 
the next generation of nanoautomobiles. The world’s 
first nanocar race was held in France, using a 
scanning tunnelling microscope to propel six of the 
world’s smallest cars towards the finish line. These 
experiments are good for more than just 
entertainment, however. They could one day lead to 
programmable machines capable of performing 
mechanical work on a miniature scale.

end product itself is entirely 
unnatural. This synthetic 
product can now be found in every corner of 
the world, in remote places like the deep ocean

This is because plastic doesn’t fully decompose. 
Every piece of plastic produced still 
exists in some form, even if it’s out of sight. 
In most instances, plastic products have 
been broken down into microplastics, tiny 
fragments that have been reduced to a length 
of five millimetres or less, too small to see 
with the naked eye. The first evidence of 
microplastic pollution was discovered in the 
oceans, where scientists have estimated that 
there are 24.4 trillion microplastic particles in 
the upper oceans alone.
These tiny pieces of plastic are divided 
into primary and secondary microplastics. 
Primary are those that are intentionally

while the latter are broken down in the 
environment from larger objects.

Microbeads
These spheres have a 
diameter less than one 
millimetre. They are often used 
to add exfoliating properties in 
soaps but are difficult to filter out

many countries.
Fragments
When a larger piece of 
plastic breaks down over 
time, it becomes smaller 
microplastic fragments. 
Usually this is a result of

Around one per cent of microplastics in 
the ocean, such as those containing 
polypropylene, float at the surface and 
are easily transported by currents.
Many microplastics are 
produced in factories, such 
as pellets and powders. 
Other products are broken 
down into microplastics 
after entering the ocean.
The plastic we see washed 
up on beaches is only a 
a small part of the problem.
Combined, small 
particles in the oceans 
are equivalent to around 
30 billion 500-millilitre 
plastic water bottles.
Microplastics travel into oceans through 
rivers, but sometimes these plastics are 
caught in riverbeds for several years.
When microplastics 
sink, they are often 
mistaken for food by 
marine animals.

There are five main ocean gyres, or 
garbage patches, in Earth’s oceans that 
have brought together many millions or 
billions of plastic pieces. In the largest of 
these, the North Pacific Gyre, there are an 
estimated 1.8 trillion pieces - that’s about 
250 pieces of plastic for every human on 
Earth. The other gyres are the North 
Atlantic Gyre, the South Atlantic Gyre, the 
South Pacific Gyre and the Indian Ocean 
Gyre. Although these patches are mostly 
made of plastic debris, they aren’t 
exclusively plastic. Among the 
microplastic masses are larger pieces of 
rubbish, including fishing equipment, 
bottles and even mobile phones. Due to 
the circular movement of these patches, 
plastic items remain trapped in ocean 
gyres and are broken down by the Sun 
and the waves into microplastics.

Reducing 
exposure
Microplastics appear to be 
everywhere on the planet. But is it 
possible to avoid exposure to them 
in everyday life? Because you can’t 
always see microplastics, you don’t 
know when they’re entering your 
body, but there are steps you can 
take to reduce the volume you 
come into contact with.
Firstly, you can change the 
containers that you eat or drink out 
of. For example, replace disposable 
coffee cups with stainless steel or 
glass ones and stop microwaving 
foods in plastic containers. Plastic 
can enter your food much more 
easily when heated, so transferring 
it into another dish can reduce how 
much plastic you accidentally 
consume. Plastic tea bags are 
capable of releasing 11.6 billion 
microplastics and 3.1 billion 
nanoplastics into your drink. To 
avoid this, you can replace them 
with loose leaf tea. Similarly, when 
choosing meals to eat, cutting 
down on seafood consumption can 
reduce how many of these particles 
enter your body.
Every time you wash clothes 
made of nylon, polyester or acrylic, 
you release hundreds of thousands 
of microfibres. To avoid releasing 
these microplastics, you can check 
the materials of clothes before 
buying them or install a filter into the 
washing machine to catch any that 
come loose. Additionally, when 
choosing cosmetics to apply to your 
skin, it helps to choose products that 
don’t contain any microbeads or 
any form of plastic ingredient.

Water moves slowly through a 
sedimentation tank to allow suspended 
microplastic particles to sink and be 
filtered out of the water.
These technologies and techniques can help reduce 
microplastics
Mussel power
n 2021, studies carried out
I
 at the UK’s Plymouth Marine 
Laboratory found that mussels 
- and in particular their poop 
- could help scientists remove 
microplastics from rivers and 
estuaries. The experiment, which focused on 
blue mussels, uncovered that because these 
creatures can filter microplastic pieces out 
from their bodies and into their faeces, they 
become buoyant when excreted.
By using this method, a quarter of all 
waterborne microplastics that these mussels 
encounter can be released to the water’s 
surface for collection. The scientists discovered 
that 300 blue mussels can filter out 250,000 
microplastics per hour using this method. 
Since the experiment, trials have begun to find 
an effective system for mussel microplastic 
removal. These involve submerging masses of 
mussels in containers, with nets attached to 
collect the microplastic-filled faeces.
2
 Aeration
Oxygen is added to cause growth of 
microorganisms and break down 
organics. The mesh used to collect waste 
products can trap up to 99 per cent of 
microplastics.
Robot removers
One potential solution for removing 
these tiny plastic pollutants is to deploy 
robots into the environment. In June 
2022, a research paper from Sichuan 
University in China described a flexible, 
13-millimetre-long fish-like robot that is 
both self-propelling and self-healing. The 
undisclosed soft material attracts the 
dyes and heavy metals in the 
microplastics to the robot fish through 
chemical bonds and electrostatics. 
Once in contact, the robot holds onto 
the microplastics and carries them until 
they are collected. If these fake fish get 
damaged while in the water, they can 
repair themselves and continue to 
depollute the seas, with a retained 
efficiency at least 89 per cent of what it 
was before it was damaged.
More research is needed before these 
robots can be released on a large scale 
to make a difference, but it’s a useful 
insight into the technology that could 
one day be working in the background 
to reverse the damage we’ve done to 
the environment.

An oxidant called ozone is added to 
water to break down contaminants such 
as microplastics. This is the most effective 
step to completely destroy them.

The chemistry and biology behind the natural 
breakdown of organic matter
94

he term ‘biodegradable’ is often 
Tused to describe a material’s 
ability to be broken down 
naturally by the environment 
through a process known as 
biodegradation. During this 
process, organic matter, such as that found in 
plants and animals, is torn apart, broken down 
and digested by fungi and microbes. What 
remains is a nutrient-rich biomass that fuels 
the growth of new plants and animals in a 
repeating and self-sustaining process - it’s quite 
literally the circle of life.
One of the most important aspects of 
biodegradation is the transfer of carbon. Often 
referred to simply as the carbon cycle, this 
natural undertaking helps regulate the planet’s 
temperature, as well as provide food and energy 
to its inhabitants. During the cycle, carbon is 
exchanged with oxygen in the atmosphere 
through plant photosynthesis, which is then 
stored in plant matter. That carbon is passed 
on to the animal that eats the plant, then to 
the animal that eats that animal, and so on, 
up through the food chain. When plants and 
animals die, that carbon is returned to the earth 
through biodegradation, whereby countless 
microorganisms chow down on organic matter, 
releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere to 
restart the cycle.
Outside of the natural order of things, 
the word ‘biodegradable’ is used as a label 
to describe products and packaging that 
are capable of undergoing the process 
of biodegradation, as opposed to non- 
biodegradable materials such as plastic, glass 
and metals. When we toss away our rubbish, 
it typically ends up in one of three places: an 
incinerator, landfill site or recycling centre. As 
the name suggests, incinerators torch waste and 
convert it into ash and gas, whereas recycling 
centres seek to transform materials into 
something useful. Landfill sites, on the other

Organic matter 
decomposes into smaller 
pieces, either through 
physical forces such as 
wind and rain or from 
living organisms in the 
soil, such as fungi and 
invertebrates.

Over time, microbes 
such as bacteria finish off

are three byproducts: 
carbon dioxide, water 
and a carbon-rich 
substance called 
biomass.

The byproducts of 
biodegradation are then 
assimilated back into the 
environment and used to 
promote the new growth 
of organic matter.

Pseudomonas are one of the many 
groups of bacteria in the environment 
involved in the biodegradation process
hand, are places where biodegradation can 
occur. It occurs under one of two conditions: 
aerobically, with the help of oxygen, or 
anaerobically, without oxygen. Because of 
the compacted structure of a landfill site, 
biodegradation often occurs anaerobically, the 
slowest of the two conditions. Some studies 
have found that food items such as grapes and 
corn cobs are still recognisable 25 years after 
entering a landfill. Meanwhile, in an oxygen­
rich compostable environment, it would take 
only weeks for them to decompose.
The phrase biodegradable is often used 
interchangeably with compostable, but the two 
are very different. For a product or material to
10 million tonnes 
of plastic 
reaches the 
ocean each year
be considered compostable there needs to be no 
harmful chemicals or substances that release 
during the process of biodegradation. There 
are some instances where materials such as 
plastics are classed as biodegradable, but in the 
process they also release toxic chemicals into 
the environment.
Each year we produce around 380 million 
tonnes of non-biodegradable plastics, and 
only 50 per cent of this is recycled. Traditional 
petroleum-based plastics are made from oils 
and gases that form robust molecular chains 
called polymers. These chains are so robust 
that they are unable to be broken down 
through biodegradation alone. However,
some biodegradable plastics are more 
environmentally friendly.
Bioplastics and biodegradable plastics 
are two different things. Bioplastics are made 
from natural plant matter that’s usually 
chemically treated to form strong polymer 
plastics called polylactic acid or polylactide. 
Though biodegradable plastics still use raw 
materials such as oil, different chemicals are 
added that allow the plastic to ‘biodegrade’ 
in the right circumstances, such as in high 
temperatures and under ultraviolet light.
Although biodegradable plastics will 
k k break down much faster than the 
I non-biodegradable versions, taking 
F between three and six months, 
they release harmful chemicals 
and substances into the environment 
if they are not disposed of correctly.
Bioplastics, on the other hand, release no such 
toxic chemicals. In the same way that organic 
materials shed carbon during decomposition, 
bioplastics also release carbon stored in the 
plant matter within them. Despite the risk to the 
environment, the popularity of bioplastics has 
struggled to match that of non-biodegradable 
alternatives. In 2022, only 1,142 tonnes of 
bioplastics were produced globally.
Bioplastics are often used in food packaging and bags
Biodegradable glass
Glass is typically made by heating 
natural raw materials such as sand or 
limestone. As a rigid non-biodegradable 
material, the only way glass can break 
down in the environment is through 
physical forces such as wind and water, 
which can take up to 4,000 years. In 
March 2023, researchers at the Chinese 
Academy of Sciences created an 
experimental glass made from modified 
amino acids and peptides. In the novel 
method, amino acids are heated and
subjected to a supercooling treatment, 
then doused in water, rapidly forming a 
clear, glass-like material. When put to the 
biodegradability test, researchers 
discovered that the new glass material 
was broken down by microbes in soil 
within around three to seven months. 
Glass beads were also ingested by 
mouse subjects without causing harm 
and appeared to biodegrade in the 
body, suggesting there’s scope for its use 
in drug delivery.
Advancements in bioglass could one day 
provide a new delivery system for medicines

What is 
biofuel?
Biofuels are futuristic fuels that can 
power cars and trucks with crops, 
algae and even rubbish. Here’s how 
they’re produced
2 Growth Spurt 1
The sunlight causes 
photosynthesis, which is 
how plants turn carbon 
dioxide and water into 
oxygen and sugar.
heat and maize are used 
Hto make bread, pizza and 
other delicious foods, but in 
a few years they could also 
power your car. Renewable 
biofuels could soon replace 
the harmful fossil fuels that we’re used to 
using. It’s now well-established that fossil fuels 
are incredibly harmful to our health and the 
environment, and they’re not renewable, either. 
When so many people rely on petrol and diesel 
to power vehicles, it makes sense to develop a 
renewable alternative that’s easy to use.
That’s where biofuel comes in. The most 
common biofuel produced globally is ethanol, 
and it’s used frequently in Brazil and the US, 
while biodiesel is more popular in Europe. 
Ethanol is a clear, flavourless alcohol that’s
created by fermenting and distilling sugary 
crops like wheat, corn and sugar cane. It’s 
combined with petrol to make fuel more 
environmentally friendly, and it’s already in 
widespread use. More than 95 per cent 
of petrol sold in the US contains 
ethanol, and E10 fuel - made from 
ten per cent ethanol - is now the 
standard petrol in the UK. Alcohol 
combines with oil or fat to create 
biodiesel. It works directly in many 
car engines, but it’s usually combined 
Brazil and the US 
produce 87 per 
cent of the 
world’s ethanol
with conventional diesel to create a more 
effective blend. It’s produced from vegetable oil, 
animal fat, soy or palm oil.
There’s a huge amount of potential in biofuel, 
and most of the big energy companies have 
already invested - but emerging energy sources 
like ethanol are first-generation biofuels, and 
they’ve got issues that need fixing before they 
can go mainstream. It currently takes more 
ethanol than gasoline to produce the same
amount of energy, for instance. Production 
is expensive, and several parts of the 
process sometimes use fossil fuels, 
which means that some biofuels 
aren’t actually carbon neutral.
Some environmental campaigners 
also say that it would be more useful
to grow crops for food rather than
biofuel, and that growing crops for biofuel 
can cause problems with soil erosion and 
deforestation. Using land for fuel rather than 
food can lead to an increase in food prices, 
too, and can hinder natural habitats. Crop 
and fat-based biofuels may not be perfect, but

WHAT IS 
BIOFUEL?

water system called a 
bioreactor that’s 
exposed to sunlight.
The Algae

Sweet Reactions
Algae is touted as a more efficient option for biofuel 
creation - but how does this work?
Extraction
5 Surface Pressure
Alternative methods 
involve subjecting algae 
to high-pressure and 
temperature 
environments to extract 
oil to use in biofuels.
4 Water Mess
Once algae is harvested, it’s 
usually dehydrated. After that, oil 
and carbohydrates can be used 
to create biodiesel or ethanol.
Creating ethanol is a complex chemical 
process. Plant cells contain cellulose, 
hemicellulose and lignin. Acids, enzymes 
and other chemicals break the plants down, 
and the result is a pure sugar solution called 
sucrose. At this point, scientists add yeast, 
and the solution heats to between 250 and 
300 degrees Celsius. The yeast has an 
enzyme called invertase. Heat activates this, 
converting the sucrose into glucose and 
fructose. These sugars combine with another 
enzyme, called zymase, which converts them 
into ethanol. That ethanol still has lots of 
water, though, so the next step involves 
boiling. Because ethanol boils at 78.3 and 
water boils at 100 degrees Celsius, the 
ethanol boils and turns into vapour first; it can 
be separated from the water, condensed 
back to liquid form and used for biofuel.
Biofuel can increase the lifetime of your car’s engine
t
“Wheat and maize could power 
your car in a few years”
those aren’t the only biofuels available - some 
organisations are creating biofuels with algae 
instead. This process uses water and land that 
often isn’t suitable for many other situations, 
so it doesn’t take up space that’s useful for food 
production, and it often has better yields than 
other types of biofuel components.
There’s plenty of development beyond algae, 
too. Many companies are developing crops for 
biofuels, and those will improve yields, increase 
efficiency and reduce costs. Some even use 
seaweed. Scientists are also working to extract 
biofuels from household waste, wood chips 
and other junk - a move that could massively 
increase the material that’s viable for biofuel 
production. These second-generation biofuels 
could make biofuel far cheaper and more 
accessible, and help cut emissions down.
Racing Ahead
The World Rally Championship (WRC) is a 
global motorsport competition that made 
a groundbreaking switch to biofuel for its 
2022 season. The WRC now uses a second- 
generation biofuel made from organic 
waste material, which is combined with 
synthetic fuel. The production process uses 
renewable energy and takes carbon 
dioxide out of the atmosphere thanks to 
carbon capture. It’s the first time that a 
fossil-free fuel has powered a world 
motorsport championship. This isn’t the only 
time you’ll see biofuel used in a high- 
performance situation, either. Formula 1 
now runs with a ten per cent biofuel blend, 
and the aviation and shipping industries 
are increasing their usage. It’s even being 
used by space start-ups.

King Clone
University of California professor Frank
single organism and estimated its age
The survival abilities of creosote bushes are impressive across the 
board; the small, waxy-leaved shrubs are adapted to life in the most 
arid deserts. However, the doughnut-shaped bushes that make up the 
King Clone bush ring are believed to have come from one of the first 
life forms to thrive in the Mojave Desert, appearing shortly after 
glaciers covered this land. When the original plant that grew in place 
of this ring began to wither away thousands of years ago, its roots 
branched out underground and created offshoots from which new 
plants of the same organism could grow. Over time, these plants have 
expanded to form the ancient bush ring, with a diameter that reaches 
up to 20 metres and has an average of 14 metres.
Today, each of these individual trees is an 
exact replica of the original, which shed its 
branches and so multiplied in number. After 
uncovering that each of the Mount Read Huon 
pine trees were identical in the 1990s, scientists 
developed a theory about how the original 
ancient tree lives on in others. The main theory 
is that its branches were weighed down by 
snow and ice over the course of millennia. As 
the branches came into contact with the ground 
they were able to re-root themselves and form 
new trees. While none of the trees today are as 
old as the first to plant its roots here, this cloned 
population is essentially the same organism as 
the one that shed its branches centuries ago.
he ancestry of the Huon pine 
T plant family, Podocarpaceae, 
can be traced back to 200 
million years ago through 
fossilised plant pollen records. 
But despite being called a 
pine, the Huon pine is actually another type of 
coniferous tree with scale-like leaves called a 
Podocarpus tree. In Tasmania, there’s one clonal 
population of this tree that covers an area of 
10,000 square metres. Even though it’s a large 
population each one stemmed from a single 
male Huon pine tree that grew over 10,500 years 
ago. This makes it the world’s oldest colony of 
genetically identical trees.

Ice age flower
32,000years old • Kolyma River, Russia
ome of the world’s oldest plants have survived across
millennia. But Silene stenophylla, a flowering plant 
known commonly as the narrow-leafed campion, has 
the honour of being one of the world’s most ancient 
living plants after being brought back to life. When
scientists were studying the remains of an ancient 
squirrel burrow, inside they discovered the seeds of the narrow-leafed 
campion, preserved in permafrost. Permafrost is any layer of soil that 
remains frozen for at least two years. In this case, however, the plant’s 
genes stayed frozen for many thousands of years at over 40 metres below 
Earth’s surface. By germinating these seeds, the scientists brought the 
preserved genes to life and were able to analyse the evolution of the 
species with this live, historic sample.
King’s lomatia

here are around 300 of these plants left in existence on 
the planet, but some would say there’s just one left. This is 
because the King’s lomatia is a clonal group with the same 
genetic information. These flowering plants don’t produce 
seeds, but shed their branches in order to reproduce
identical copies through re-rooting.
The last remaining colony exists in a secret location in Tasmania 
in order to keep them protected. The plants of this colony have been 
growing in Tasmania for at least 43,600 years, but some scientists think it 
could be as many as 135,000. Today the King’s lomatia covers a single one- 
kilometre strip of Tasmanian land.

both bell-shaped flowers and dark berries 
that are similar to blueberries in appearance. 
It’s the oldest known shrub colony in the world 
and was discovered in 1920 in Perry County, 
Pennsylvania. Losh Run remained a single

THE OLDEST PLANTS

Pando, the oldest 
living organism
80,000years old iFishlake 
tional Forest Ut
Comprising over 40,000 quaking aspen trees, Pando 
is the world’s largest organism by weight. It’s 
considered a single organism because Pando, 
which translates to ‘I spread’ in Latin, is one large 
root system. The forest of trees covers 429,000 square 
metres and has an estimated weight of 6,600 
tonnes. To make new individuals in the colony, 
Pando releases new shoots from the existing tree 
roots. These eventually separate from the original 
tree and grow a replica, increasing the chances of 
the organism’s survival. This technique has allowed 
Pando to thrive over many thousands of years, 
combating forest fires and other natural disasters.

Fascinating 
fruit
From the stench of the durian to the flavour- 
changing ability of miracle berries, discover 
the wonderful world of fruit
he world is full of interesting 
Tand delicious fruits. From sour 
grapes to giant pumpkins, there 
are around 2,000 different 
types of fruits growing around 
the globe. In botanical terms, 
a fruit is a ripened ovary, a reproductive 
structure that bears the plant’s ovule, also 
known as the seeds. Once a plant is pollinated, 
fruits begin to emerge from the fertilised flower 
and develop, mature and ripen, by which time 
the encapsulated seeds are ready for dispersal. 
When it comes to identifying fruits, there 
are a whole host of subcategories they fall into. 
However, they largely sit within one of three 
categories: simple, aggregate and multiple. 
Simple fruits include the majority of fruits, 
such as stone fruits, pome and berries. Their 
anatomy is typically divided into three parts; 
the exocarp, mesocarp and endocarp. The outer 
skin is its exocarp, the mesocarp forms its flesh 
and the endocarp forms the innermost part of 
the fruit - the seeds.
Aggregate fruits, on the other hand, are merged 
from individual flowers that give rise to a curious 
collection. Raspberries are composed of lots of 
once-separate carpels - the juicy, seed-containing 
parts. Then there’s the third kind of fruit, which 
pineapples belong to, called multiple fruits. Unlike 
aggregate fruits, multiple fruits are formed from 
a group of flowers that each produce a fruit that 
matures into a single mass.
Plants are proficient in the art of seduction. 
In lieu of attracting another plant for 
reproduction, fruits engage the senses of 
the animals needed for pollination and to 
spread their seeds. Seed dispersal by way of 
animal intervention typically occurs in one 
of two ways. When an animal such as a deer 
wanders into an orchard and chews down
on juicy apples, it feeds not only on the flesh, 
but the encased seeds as well. From there, the 
seeds travel through the animal’s digestive 
system and emerge once again among a pile 
of freshly made droppings. This nutrient-rich 
manure then provides the conditions needed 
for the seeds to germinate and a new plant 
to grow. Other animals, such as many rodent 
species, bury fruits in an attempt to store them 
for a later meal. However, when they leave the 
fruit beneath the soil, the seeds are given the 
opportunity to germinate and grow.
In the same way the vibrancy of flower petals 
attracts pollinators, fruits come in all colours of 
the rainbow in the hope of attracting potential 
seed-dispersing animals. Studies have shown 
that mammals such as monkeys and apes 
disperse more seeds of green fruits, while birds 
prefer the vibrancy of red fruits. Similarly, smell 
and taste also act as a way to entice animals 
to take a bite and spread the seeds within. In 
Madagascar, several species of colour-blind 
lemurs play an important role in spreading the 
seeds of fig trees. As colour isn’t an alluring 
option for these trees, they have evolved fruits 
that emit a pungent scent when ripe, which the 
lemurs find enticing.
While many people will be able to empathise 
with the lemurs’ love of sweet-smelling figs, 
not all fruits boast such appealing aromas. 
Pungent odours, including the smells of rotting 
onions and sewage, are equally important in 
attracting animals. For example, the noni fruit 
that’s found on Pacific islands and in Southeast 
Asia, gives off an extremely pungent smell of 
stinky cheese and rotting fish. However, several 
bat and bird species aren’t at all deterred by 
the terrible smell, instead flocking to this foul­
smelling feast and subsequently spreading the 
seeds far and wide.

Animals typically access a plant’s fruit from 
the swinging branches of trees and shrubs, but 
some fruits have begun growing underground. 
Researchers discovered in 2023 that a new 
species of palm called Pinanga subterranea is 
growing its fruits and flowers below the surface. 
Around 171 species of plants are known to grow 
their fruits underground, including several 
orchids. Unlike topside fruits, those that are 
produced by the palm are not exposed to the 
breadth of pollinators and animals involved 
in seed dispersal. Scientists believe that 
subterranean insects may be responsible for 
pollinating these palms, and wild boar may sniff 
out and dig up the fruit for seed dispersal.
As well as being a vessel for plant 
propagation, fruits come with a whole host 
of health benefits for humans to enjoy. From 
topping up the body’s vitamin levels to 
producing vital fibre needed for a healthy gut, 
the world’s edible fruits are a great source of 
nutrition, with equally great health benefits. 
Many fruits such as blueberries, apples and
cherries are also high in molecules called 
antioxidants. Once ingested, antioxidants seek 
out and destroy harmful molecules called free 
radicals. Free radicals are naturally produced 
by the body, as well as exposure to pollution 
and cigarette smoke, but can contribute 
to several health conditions, such as the

buildup of cholesterol plaque, which leads 
to the development of heart disease. As well 
as cardiovascular issues, free radicals have 
been linked to chronic health problems such 
as inflammatory diseases and even cancer. 
When some fruit-sourced antioxidants come 
into contact with a free radical, they knock 
off one of its electrons and render it useless, 
preventing it from causing further harm to the 
body. To reap all the health benefits that fruits 
have to offer, the UK’s National Health Service 
recommends eating five 80-gram portions of 
fruit a day for adults.

The miracle fruit
Tasteless alone, these berries have a unique property
iracle berries (Synsepalum dulcificum)
M
are native to the tropical regions of West 
Africa but have been cultivated around 
the world for their miraculous abilities. 
Despite being tasteless, miracle berries
possess a protein that transforms the 
taste of other acidic or bitter foods. After chowing down on 
these berries, they will make taking a bite out of a lemon 
taste like you’re drinking the sweetest lemonade and make a 
swig of apple cider vinegar bearable.
The mysterious powers of the fruit come from a natural 
sweetener called miraculin. When ingested, miraculin 
binds to the sweet taste receptors on the tongue for up 
to around 60 minutes. When a bitter-tasting food comes 
into contact with the miraculin, it changes shape, causing 
the sweet receptor to think it’s come across a molecule from 
a sweet-tasting substance such as sucralose or aspartame. 
Even though miracle berries might make a great sugar or 
artificial sweetener substitute, the fruits are only produced 
on a small scale and are not able to replace what’s currently 
commercially available.
Horned melon
Kiwano (Cucumis metuliferus), 
also known as the African 
horned cucumber or horned 
melon, is an intimidating fruit 
that originated in the Kalahari 
Desert, Africa, but has been 
cultivated in the tropical 
regions of South Africa and 
other parts of the world, such 
as New Zealand. The 
contrasting colours of the 
fruit’s outer orange skin and its 
vibrant green pulp entice a 
myriad of critters, including 
birds, primates, rodents and 
antelopes, to feast and 
spread its seeds. The pulp is 
said to taste like a cross 
between a banana, melon 
and lime, and is packed with 
vitamins B and C.

Snake fruit
As its name suggests, snake fruit 
(Salacca zalacca) has a unique 
surface, akin to that of king cobra 
scales. The unusual fruit is grown in 
Southeast Asia and is native to 
Indonesia. Unlike many other 
drupes, the snake fruit has a 
leathery peel that’s made up of lots 
of small, triangular scales. When 
the scales are chipped away, three 
lobes of juicy, white flesh are 
revealed. Snake fruit tastes like 
a combination of apple and 
pineapple, with the crisp texture of 
an apple, and is often eaten raw or 
turned into jams or syrups.
Buddha’s 
hand citron
A popular fruit within Asia, Buddha’s hand citron 
(Citrus medica digitata) is thought to have reached 
China in the satchels of Buddhist monks travelling 
from India in the 4th century. Other than its digit-like 
appearance, one of the remarkable things about 
this fruit is its high level of pith. Citruses, such as 
lemons and limes, all have an internal fibrous pith to 
support juicy seed-bearing centres. However, the 
majority of this fruit is made up of pith, which limits 
its use. Traditionally, Buddha’s hand is used to 
enhance the scents of other foods, such as sugars 
and ice cream, thanks to its potent tangerine-and- 
lemon aroma.

it’s ripe
When fruit is ripe and ready to 
drop to the ground, the plant 
cells between the fruit and 
parent plant separate at a 
junction called the 
abscission zone.
otting onions, old socks, 
Rbin juice and raw sewage 
are all ways in which the 
smell of the durian fruit 
(Durio zibethinus) has been 
described. The smell of durian 
is so potent that consumption of the fruit has 
been banned on public transport in Singapore, 
and in some hotels in Thailand. A durian’s 
scent stems from its ripened pulp and is the 
result of the release of a combination of more 
than 50 compounds, including an odorous 
sulphur-smelling chemical called ethanethiol. 
On their own the individual compounds aren’t 
particularly powerful in their odours, nor does 
any smell like a durian. However, when they 
all come together they create the symphony of 
durian smell. The reason behind the odorous 
nature of this fruit is like any other: to entice 
animals that find the scent appealing in the 
hope of dispersing the seeds within.
Despite its pungent aroma, durian, k jL 
also nicknamed the ‘king of

popular food, particularly 
.
in many Southeast
Asian countries. As a nutritious fruit, durian 
is packed with helpful vitamins and minerals 
that support the body’s immune system. Studies 
have also shown that the fruit is full of folate 
and folic acid, which can help combat anaemia 
and promote regular tissue growth during 
pregnancy. From coffee to candy, the distinctive 
scent and taste of durian fruit has also found 
its way into countless snacks and confectionery

Why leaves turn 
brown in autumn
Earth’s deciduous plants lose their luscious green leaves 
during this changing of the seasons
n many parts of the world, the end 
I of the summer season is marked 
by drastic changes in the trees’ 
appearance. Leaves of red, orange, 
yellow and brown dance through 
the breeze before landing to create 
a crunchy layer on the ground. Autumn can 
produce distinctive colours, but for some plants 
it’s a time to take drastic action for survival. 
Evergreens aside, trees have very thin leaves. 
To keep them attached throughout winter would 
be dangerous as they would freeze - their cells 
would rupture and lose vital nutrients. The usual 
food-making process of converting sunlight and 
carbon dioxide into sugars is put on hold. The 
production of green cells called chloroplasts that 
enable this process is halted and nutrients are 
absorbed into the core of the tree to be utilised 
during the colder months. With this reduction 
of the core green cells, other pigments that exist 
in the leaves are given a season to paint the 
landscape with their bold colours.
When the tree has absorbed
it detaches trom the tree
What triggers new colours?
One of the most important factors in triggering these 
drastic changes is the amount of daylight available. As 
the days grow shorter and shorter, plants are unable to 
rely primarily on sunlight for their energy production. 
Secondly, the rate of photosynthesis decreases as the 
temperature plummets. The combination of these 
seasonal changes means that when autumn sets in, 
plants can’t thrive using the same systems.

Autumn anatomy
The cells and structures that help leaves change colour
Anthocyanins
Red and purple 
pigments are 
produced in the sap 
of plant cells. 
Anthocyanins prevent 
the plant from drying 
out during cold 
months to hold onto 
existing nutrients.
Chloroplasts
When plants stop using 
photosynthesis, the 
chloroplasts that 
previously stored green 
chlorophyll degrade into 
gerontoplasts and 
continue to store food.

These compounds are 
waste products of metabolic 
processes within the leaves. 
While they are always present, 
only when other pigment 
levels, such as chlorophyll 
and carotenoids, are 
low are these visible as 
brown hues.
Compound: 
Anthocyanin
As chlorophyll is broken down, 
anthocyanins are produced. 
These produce leaves of 
red, purple and pink that 
are displayed on trees 
such as maples, oaks 
and sumacs.
Compound: 
Carotene
Sugar maple trees turn a vibrant 
orange colour in autumn due to 
the increased concentration of 
carotene pigment. While 
chlorophyll diminishes with 
reduced light, carotene doesn’t. 
This increases its 
concentration, and 
when combined with 
anthocyanin, different 
shades of orange 
are made.
Compound: 
Xanthophyll
This pigment is in a group called 
carotenoids, along with 
carotene. However, this pigment 
contains more oxygen and 
produces a light-yellow colour. 
Some of the trees that 
display xanthophyll in 
autumn include birches, 
beeches and aspens.
Evergreen plants continue to 
photosynthesise during 
autumn. They retain their 
green colour year-round 
by continually 
producing chlorophyll 
- the green pigment 
that absorbs sunlight.

Why is grass
The same molecules that feed grass also give it its colour
ike many of the plants on Earth, 
grass is mostly green. This is 
because there are millions 
of cells called chloroplasts in 
every blade of grass. Within 
these cells is a pigment called 
chlorophyll. We see grass as green because it is 
one of the few visible wavelengths from the Sun 
that chlorophyll doesn’t absorb. Instead, after 
sunlight reaches grass, the green wavelengths 
are reflected off the plant. So when they reach 
our eyes, we see grass as green.
But the main role of these cells isn’t to 
look pretty. Grass gets its green colour as a 
consequence of one of the plant’s most vital 
processes - photosynthesis. Within chloroplasts, 
the green-giving pigments absorb large amounts 
of light so that they can use its energy to produce 
glucose for food. Red and blue wavelengths
are prioritised by the plants, as they provide 
the most energy for photosynthesis. The green 
wavelengths are reflected while the red and blue 
are absorbed. While green is the most important 
colour for us in identifying healthy grass, it’s the 
least important for the plant itself.
Losing its colour
At different times of year and in 
different weather conditions, grass 
can appear different shades of 
green. Grass grows at different rates 
based on its location, type or the 
weather. In spring, it is likely to grow 
most rapidly, producing new cells 
such as chloroplasts. The higher the 
concentration of chloroplasts within 
a blade of grass, the more green 
pigment there will be too. When grass 
turns brown or yellow it might still be 
alive, but very low on chlorophyll. 
If you notice that the bottom of 
the blades of grass are losing their 
green colour, this is often due to the 
amount of water the grass is getting. 
When grass becomes dry, the lower 
parts of the blades will begin to turn 
brown, but if the opposite is true and 
you are overwatering the grass, it may 
appear yellow. This is because if the 
soil is waterlogged, oxygen can’t get 
to the plant and the grass becomes 
oxygen-deprived.

hairs called trichomes.The bulbous 
tip of the trichome breaks off when 
it’s brushed against, revealing the 
needle-like tube below.

At the base of the trichome are 
specialised cells that secrete 
the stinging chemicals into the 
trichome needle.

O nettles (Urtica dioica) 
aren’t a particularly 
threatening-looking plant. 
However, if you’ve ever 
brushed against their 
leaves, you’ll know all too well the pain they 
can inflict.
What gives nettles their stinging power is a 
cocktail of chemicals held within tiny hair­
like structures along the plant’s leaves. When 
these structures are broken they release their 
chemical contents, which penetrate the skin and 
cause several painful symptoms such as itching, 
swelling and redness. The initial skin irritation 
felt when you are stung by a nettle is caused by 
histamine, which is also responsible for causing 
other allergic reactions.
Like many other plants, nettles have evolved 
their stinging abilities as a defence mechanism 
against herbivorous animals such as deer and 
rabbits. Nettle venom isn’t strong enough to 
seriously harm a hungry herbivore - it merely 
teaches them a lesson in avoiding nettles.
Commonly found around hedgerows, 
woodlands and fields, stinging nettles are much 
more than vicious plants, as they also play an 
important role in their ecosystem. Butterflies, 
for example, use nettles as a place to lay their 
eggs, and ladybirds and aphids use nettles for 
shelter and as a source of nutritious food.

Do dock leaves 
really work?
It’s long been believed that grabbing a 
dock leaf and rubbing it on a wound after 
a nettle sting will help ease the pain.
Dock plants, also known as bitter dock 
(Rumex obtusifolius), are said to produce 
a sap that contains an antihistamine to 
combat the effects of nettle stings. 
However, there’s no evidence of such 
antihistamines or healing chemical 
properties. The placebo effect has also 
been cited as a possible explanation for 
why some people believe dock leaves 
help treat the stinging sensation and 
lower the perception of pain.
One way that the dock leaf sap 
can offer some relief is through 
evaporative cooling. As the dock sap 
evaporates over the sting, the skin 
beneath can experience a cooling 
sensation that relieves some of the 
burning irritation on the skin.

Capsaicin glands
Embedded in the placenta 
and situated around the 
seeds, capsaicin glands 
produce the compound that 
gives the pepper its heat.

for heat
Chilli peppers are comprised of 
many parts, some much more 
pungent than others
What makes chilli
peppers spicy?
The least spicy edible part 
of the pepper, the apex of 
the fruit lies at its tip, where 
little capsaicin is found.
Placenta
Also called the pith, the white 
placenta can harbour around 90 
per cent of the chilli pepper’s 
capsaicin content.

The centre of the fleshy 
wall surrounding the 
internal body of the fruit,

Seeds
Often incorrectly 
considered the hottest 
component, seeds are 
not particularly dense in 
capsaicin but are near to 
the capsaicin-rich glands.

casein that can carry away

receptors in their mouths that recognise the 
compound capsaicin - and other compounds 
collectively known as capsaicinoids - produced 
within chilli peppers. Capsaicin surrounds 
the seeds, which are needed for the plant to 
germinate its progeny, and the compound 
triggers the sensation of burning when 
consumed. This helps dissuade rodents and
pices have been part of 
human diets for thousands 
of years, and chilli peppers 
are now staple ingredients 
in many parts of the world. 
Chilli peppers are fruits 
and are part of the nightshade family, which 
contains members such as tomatoes, avocados 
and potatoes. Within this family lies the genus 
Capsicum that hosts peppers, a group of 
related species that are carefully cultivated to 
produce fruits with a spectrum of flavour and 
heat. From the mild bell pepper and the lively 
jalapeno to the unrelenting brutality of the 
Trinidad Moruga scorpion and Carolina reaper, 
peppers come in all ranges of spiciness. The heat, 
or pungency, of a chilli pepper is a product of 
its DNA, the environment it’s grown in and its 
ripeness. DNA can be changed by cross-breeding 
two species, followed by selective breeding of the 
offspring where the progeny with the desired 
traits are bred further. The stress imposed on 
the pepper, such as the temperature it’s grown 
in and the amount of water available to it, can 
likewise affect its pungency. Peppers also become 
spicier as they ripen from green to red.
While humans have learnt to manipulate 
and enrich pepper qualities, their spicy trait 
first evolved naturally as a defence mechanism. 
Rodents and mammals are equipped with 
mammals from eating too much, with the latter 
being particularly threatening to the plant as 
they can grind and destroy the seeds as they 
eat the fruit. But birds, which do not grind 
the seeds and instead are useful helpers in 
dispersing them, are not sensitive to capsaicin 
and so are not discouraged from feeding. 
Capsaicin also wards off microorganisms from 
invading and decomposing the plant matter 
from the inside.
If capsaicin production and its spicy heat 
have evolved to deter hungry mammals from 
munching through peppers, then why do many 
humans ravenously ingest them? Spice serves 
a practical role in food by helping to prevent

WHAT MAKES CHILLI 
PEPPERS SPICY?
The Scoville scale
In 1912, Wilbur Scoville created the Scoville 
Organoleptic Test as a means of measuring 
the amount of heat in a pepper. The method 
he developed was part quantitative and 
part subjective. Scoville gathered taste 
testers and asked them to taste a pepper’s 
capsaicin content - dissolved in an alcohol 
solution - mixed with sugar water. The 
capsaicin solution would be continually 
diluted with sugar water until heat could no 
longer be detected, which provided Scoville 
heat units (SHU). A pepper measuring 5,000 
SHU would need to be diluted by 5,000 
before no heat could be detected.
Jalapenos measure between 3,000 and 
10,000 SHU, whereas pure capsaicin 
measures 16,000,000.

like the challenging heat. Capsaicin can trigger 
the release of endorphins that provide pleasure 
as a means to combat the pain.
However, the pleasure of eating spice is not 
for all of us. The endorphin release does not 
happen for everyone equally, and for those 
who are sensitive or who overindulge, the 
pleasure can quickly recede while the pain 
intensifies. Unfortunately, the damage of too 
much spice doesn’t end in our mouths, as 
capsaicin can bind to receptors in our stomach 
and intestines. This can trigger diarrhoea as our 
body acts to protect itself by rapidly funnelling 
the irritant compound through the gut as 
quickly as possible. And the receptors that 
interpret capsaicin as heat at the beginning of 
our gastrointestinal tract are also there at the 
end, which is why we can also feel burning as 
we eliminate stool. Finally, as capsaicin is an 
irritant that also affects our outer organs, the 
spiciest peppers can elicit burning sensations 
when they contact our skin and eyes.

How to eat 
poisonous plants
Here’s how toxic compounds are removed from some of our foods
here are plenty of species 
Tof plants around the world 
that contain substances that 
could either kill you or cause 
you harm. However, there 
are also some species where 
humankind has figured out ways to bypass or 
remove them, making the plants safe to eat. 
For thousands of years, Aboriginal groups 
in northern Australia have been eating plant 
seeds that are so toxic that, when ingested, 
just two are strong enough to kill a canine. 
These potent plants are called cycads and can 
be found in tropical and subtropical regions 
around the world. The seeds of these plants are 
filled with a toxin called cycasin, which can 
wreak havoc on the human body. Once inside 
the body’s digestive system, intestinal bacteria 
alter the cycasin, releasing a toxic metabolite 
called methylazoxymethanol. This metabolite
enters the hepatic portal vein, the vein that 
supplies blood from the spleen and intestines 
to the liver, and starts damaging liver cells. 
The damage can lead to hepatic necrosis (death 
of liver cells), gastrointestinal irritation, liver 
failure and death.
Over time, Aboriginal peoples developed 
several ways to avoid the poisonous power 
of these seeds to access their high nutritional 
value. One of the most successful methods was
Kidney beans
Cherries
Sitting in the centres of many fruits are toxins. 
Stoned fruits, also known as drupes, such as 
cherries and peaches contain a central seed or 
pit surrounded by fleshy fruit. Within the seed is 
amygdalin. Similar to almonds, when ingested 
it’s converted by the body into cyanide. Around 
200 raw cherry seeds contain around 117 
milligrams of cyanide - a lethal dosage of 
cyanide ranges from 0.5 to three milligrams per 
kilogram of body weight.
The raw foods you didn’t know 
were filled with toxins
Poison pantry
Dried beans, such as kidney beans and soya 
beans, are toxic. Uncooked kidney beans contain 
something called phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), a 
type of protein called a lectin. Lectins play many 
different roles in the body, but some, such as PHA, 
can be toxic at high levels. Symptoms of PHA 
poisoning include violent diarrhoea and vomiting, 
which ease after around three to four hours. 
Simply soaking the raw beans for at least five 
hours and boiling them for at least 30 minutes 
destroys the toxin.
120

Similarly to potatoes, rhubarb also has 
toxic leaves. Although the stems are 
delicious, their leaves are packed with oxalic 
acid - around 0.5 grams per 100 grams of 
leaves. Some signs of oxalic acid poisoning 
include vomiting, abdominal pain, convulsion 
and even red-coloured urine. The acid is fatal 
when between 15 and 30 grams is ingested, 
which would be between three and six 
kilograms of rhubarb leaves.

prolonged leaching, whereby the seeds were 
harvested, dried and pounded before being 
left to soak in either streams or human-made 
waterholes for between three and seven days.
This preparation broke down the cell 
membranes of the seeds and allowed the toxin 
to leach out of them. Aboriginals also found 
that ageing the seeds underground for several 
months achieved similar results. Like cycads, 
there are many other seeds, nuts and beans 
that need to be treated before they are safe to 
eat. For example, almonds are a popular snack 
or ingredient around the world, with around 
1.56 million tonnes of them consumed globally 
each year. However, almonds have to undergo a 
pasteurisation process to make them safe to eat 
- they can’t be eaten straight from the tree.
A cycad seed 
is around
five per cent
proteins
In their raw state, almonds contain a chemical 
called amygdalin, which is broken down by 
the body into the toxin cyanide. Once ingested, 
cyanide interferes with the ability of human 
cells to obtain energy from oxygen, causing 
the cells to die. Eating between six and ten raw 
untreated almonds can cause serious poisoning 
in the average adult, and consuming around 50 
or more can cause death. To avoid harming us, 
almonds undergo a process of pasteurisation, 
similar to the treatment of milk. Batches of 
almonds are either heated via steam, roasted, 
boiled or even chemically treated to break down 
the amygdalin before the ‘raw’ seeds hit the 
supermarket shelves.
It goes without saying that you should never 
try to eat a food that is poisonous.
Cycad seeds are highly toxic, yet 
they have been safely eaten for 
thousands of years
Almonds being treated 
for consumption
Don’t worry, you’ve not been eating 
poisonous potatoes this whole 
time. Not unless you’ve been eating 
the leaves, stem or sprouts of the 
plant that is. The green parts of the 
potato plant are packed with toxins 
called solanine and chaconine. This 
toxic duo can cause intestinal 
issues such as diarrhoea, vomiting 
and abdominal pain when ingested. 
The white, edible portion of the 
plant has very low concentrations 
of the toxins, and cooking potatoes 
eliminates the solanine and chaconine.
This common sweet treat 
contains a compound called 
glycyrrhizin. Although harmless in 
moderation, when consumed in 
excess, liquorice root and sweets 
that contain liquorice root can be 
deadly. Glycyrrhizin lowers levels of 
potassium in the body, which can 
lead to high blood pressure and 
abnormal heart rhythms. Although 
cases of fatality are extremely rare, 
eating around 57 grams of black 
liquorice a day for two weeks can 
cause heart problems.

Deadly webcap
arth’s forests are littered with 
Ethe weird and wonderful 
umbrellas of mushrooms 
- some edible and some 
deadly. Mushrooms are 
classified as the reproductive 
structures of some, but not all, species of fungi. 
Similarly to how fruits bear the seeds of some 
plants, mushrooms are filled with millions of 
spores, held in their gills. These spores ride 
the wind or hijack a lift on a passing animal 
and travel to their new home to begin another 
mushroom population.
There are around 14,000 different mushroom 
species within the 3.8 million species of fungi on 
Earth. Of those thousands, around one per cent
are poisonous and a handful of them are deadly 
enough to kill a human. Through ingestion, and 
in rare cases through touch, mushrooms can 
deliver a collection of toxins that wreak havoc 
on the human body. This can include internal 
organs failing, gastrointestinal issues and can 
even cause parts of the brain to shrink.
The most popular theory behind why 
some mushrooms have evolved to be so 
poisonous is for protection from being eaten 
by certain species, including humans. One of 
the leading causes of mushroom poisoning 
is a lack of knowledge in identifying fungi 
and misidentifying harmful mushrooms for 
edible alternatives. Here are a few of the 
worst offenders.
Cortinarius rubellus
Webcaps are among the largest 
known genera of fungi on Earth. 
Around 2,000 to 3,000 species have 
been identified. However, this deadly 
webcap is rarely found outside of 
northern Europe. Symptoms of eating a 
deadly webcap include vomiting, 
diarrhoea, headaches and ultimately 
kidney failure. These mushrooms have 
a potent toxin called orellanine. When 
ingested, orellanine produces oxygen 
radicals that damage kidney cells and 
can cause renal failure. The last known 
case of webcap poisoning in the UK 
was in 1979. The species has been 
confused with the edible chanterelle 
(Cantharellus cibarius) mushroom.

Poison fire coral
Podostroma cornu-damae
Poison fire coral looks like it belongs under the 
sea rather than in the woods, with its reddish 
finger-like protrusions emerging from the soil. 
Nevertheless, this potent fungus can be found on 
tree roots across Asia, including Japan, 
Korea and Java. Unlike many other deadly 
mushrooms that are poisonous when eaten, the 
toxins in poison fire coral can be absorbed 
straight into the skin. Touching the fungus can 
cause inflammation and dermatitis, a skin 
irritation. When eaten, toxins in these mushrooms 
called trichothecene mycotoxins can cause the 
skin to peel, hair loss and even cause shrinkage 
of the cerebellum - the portion of the brain 
involved in movement and speech.
Unfortunately, these mushrooms have 
mysteriously found their way from Asia to 
Queensland, Australia. Although scientists are 
unsure as to how and when the mushroom 
migrated, some researchers have suggested its 
spores may have made the journey down under 
thousands of years ago.
Death Cap
Amanita phalloides
The most poisonous mushroom on Earth is 
the death cap, accounting for 90 per cent of 
all deaths caused by fungi. Death caps are 
common throughout forests in the UK, Ireland 
and Europe and often grow near oak and beech 
trees. However, they can be found on almost 
every continent.
These deadly mushrooms don’t look particularly 
threatening or too dissimilar from grocery-variety 
mushrooms. However, they contain a highly 
potent toxin that is strong enough to kill a person. 
Eating just half of the mushroom cap can be 
fatal. The initial symptoms of death cap poisoning 
include diarrhoea and vomiting, causing severe 
dehydration. The amatoxins - a group of toxins 
found in other mushroom species - within the 
death cap affect the function of the human 
body’s liver cells, called hepatic cells. The toxins 
are eliminated from the body via the kidneys and 
urine, but without swift medical intervention the 
hepatic cells will die and the liver will fail around 
two to three days after ingestion.
Conocybe filaris
This is a widely distributed lawn 
mushroom that can be found in Europe, 
Asia and North America, particularly in 
the Pacific Northwest region of the US. 
Amatoxins are this mushroom’s poison 
of choice. The amatoxins found in a 
fool’s conecap are made up of nine 
different types of toxins that together 
prevent vital proteins from being 
synthesised in liver and kidney cells, 
which can be fatal. Those that ingest it 
develop gastrointestinal symptoms 
within 24 hours. Symptoms can be 
overlooked as food poisoning or 
stomach flu. This mushroom is often 
mistaken for hallucinogenic mushrooms 
such as psilocybin mushrooms. 
However, unlike psilocybin mushrooms, 
their cone-shaped caps will eventually 
open out into an umbrella.

Destroying angel Amanita virosa
As angelic as this mushroom may 
appear, its poisonous biology 
makes it devilishly dangerous. 
Closely related to the death cap, 
the destroying angel, also known 
as the death angel, contains a cell 
necrosis-inducing amatoxin. 
Research has found that these 
toxins can induce apoptosis, the 
process of programmed cell 
death. Like other mushrooms 
containing amatoxins, poisoning
symptoms begin as 
gastrointestinal irritation and later 
develop into more serious damage 
to the kidney and liver. Unlike its 
more toxic cousin the death cap, 
ingesting destroying angels isn’t 
always a death sentence, and the 
human liver can completely 
recover in some cases. These white 
mushrooms can be found in mixed 
oak and hardwood forests across 
Europe and the US.
Staying safe 
around mushrooms
David Winnard is a foraging expert and founder of 
Discover the Wild, a UK-based natural history company 
that offers foraging and species identification services. 
Winnard is a renowned naturalist in the UK and has worked 
with many conservation organisations and local councils
How do you spot a poisonous 
mushroom? What to look out for?
There’s no clear way of saying if it has 
this, it’s edible; if it has that, it’s poisonous. 
It’s not as simple as that. What we 
have are families which are generally 
considered edible which have poisonous
members. Similarly, you get very poisonous family groups 
that happen to have some edible ones. Learn edibles that 
have no poisonous lookalikes. In parts of Europe, this is 
what’s done. Learn different edible species, stick to those 
and don’t deviate. For example, porcini mushrooms don’t 
have anything that looks like them that is going to kill 
you. With foraging, identify the edible ones and ignore 
everything else to eliminate all the poisonous ones.
If you see a death cap under stress or in dry conditions 
it can look similar to blusher [Amanita rubescens], and 
they grow in the same habitat. If you’re going along with 
a basket and not really thinking about what you’re doing, 
a death cap can end up in your basket very easily. I tell 
people just don’t eat anything from the Amanita family, 
even if it’s edible. There’s no mushroom I’ve tried that is 
worth dying for.
Why is the death cap so dangerous?
Death cap is a particularly worrying one because it has 
no mechanism for people to stop eating it. With a lot of 
mushrooms, they’re bitter or foul-tasting or they smell 
bad. Whatever it is, your body reacts and says spit it out. 
Death cap doesn’t have that. It smells sickly sweet - like 
honey in some cases - you can almost smell them before 
you see them.
What advice do you have for anyone thinking of foraging 
wild mushrooms in the UK?
Understand your limits about what you do and don’t know. 
Be brave enough to say you don’t know. If you are 99.999 
per cent sure, do not eat it. You need to be 100 per cent 
certain. You also need to have the discipline to take the 
whole specimen home and confirm what you think it is 
with good reputable field guides, not apps. I’ve field-tested 
quite a few [mushroom identification] apps, and I think 
this is where more recent poisonings are probably coming 
from because people are relying on pointing their phone 
at a mushroom and seeing what it is. These apps are so far 
away from being reliable for mushrooms. For indoor house 
plants they’re great, because plants are very formulaic [in 
their appearance] - mushrooms are not.

The weird
world of mould
T/ie strangest, deadliest, most disgusting 
and useful moulds found on Earth
he world’s mould species 
belong to the fungi kingdom. 
However, the two are distinctly 
different. Most fungi can 
be either multicellular 
or unicellular organisms,
feasting on organic matter such as the carbon
and glucose content found in decaying leaves. 
Moulds, on the other hand, are only ever 
multicellular organisms, which tend to extract 
nutrition from many different sources.
There are more than 100,000 different 
species of moulds on Earth, many of which 
can be found in your home. As part of their 
reproductive cycle, moulds release their 
version of seeds, called spores. Moulds 
release hundreds of thousands of these, which 
measure between 1.0 and 40 micrometres, 
into the air - for comparison, the diameter of 
a human hair is 70 micrometres. Some of the 
spores will find a new home and begin to grow 
under the correct conditions.
Moisture is a key ingredient for a mould’s 
development. Damp walls, leaky roofs and 
spoiling fruit are all excellent sites for a mould 
spore to land. Once the spore has landed it 
develops into fine threads called hyphae. 
These intertwine and form a network called 
a mycelium. Unlike plants, mould mycelium 
cannot produce its energy from photosynthesis, 
and so draws nutrition from its surroundings by 
releasing digestive enzymes to extract carbon 
and sugars and convert them into energy.

Sporangia
At the apex of the 
sporangiophores are the 
spherical ‘fruits’ that house 
the mould spores.
Spores
The spores are the mould’s 
reproductive cells. They float through 
the air, land on more bread to 
multiply and form new mould.

The miracle fungus
If you’ve ever had a serious bacterial infection, you’re 
likely to have been treated with a little white pill made 
from mould. Discovered by chance in 1928, Penicillium 
chrysogenum can fight invading bacterial forces and 
prevent them from regrowing. While studying 
Staphylococcus bacteria, Dr Alexander Fleming 
discovered that after some time away, mould had grown 
in his study Petri dishes that were filled with bacteria. He 
witnessed that no bacteria were growing around the 
mould, soon concluding that it must produce a chemical 
defence to ward off the bacteria. He called it penicillin. 
Scientists now know that what Fleming observed was 
penicillin’s ability to break down the membrane of 
bacteria, allowing it to be tackled more easily by the 
body’s immune system. More than ten years after his 
discovery, a group of scientists uncovered Fleming’s work 
- which had been shelved by Fleming - and produced a 
pure penicillin drug to fight bacterial infections.

that doesn’t affect 
the majority of people. 
However, its spores can 
cause allergic reactions 
and lung infections in 
people with weakened 
immune systems.

5 Wheezing
The dark side
Many moulds are harmless to 
humans - some are even used to 
enrich the flavour of some 
cheeses, such as Stilton and 
Roquefort. However, the inhalation 
or ingestion of some mould spores 
can be hazardous. Black mould 
(Stachybotrys chartarum) is one of 
the worst that can find its way into 
your home. Needing only 12 to 24 
hours to grow, it’s prolific under the 
right conditions. Once it’s 
established itself, the spores can 
trigger the body’s immune 
responses, resulting in symptoms 
such as sneezing and a runny 
nose. However, in extreme cases, 
long-term exposure to black mould 
has been linked with a potentially 
life-threatening condition in 
infants called acute pulmonary 
haemorrhage, though further 
research is required.
Black mould, like many other 
mould and fungi species, can 
release mycotoxins that can disrupt 
or damage different systems in the 
body. For example, Byssochlamys is 
often found on rotting apples and 
releases a mycotoxin called 
patulin. When consumed, these 
toxins can cause vomiting and 
gastrointestinal issues in humans, 
but can lead to kidney or liver 
damage in some animals. To avoid 
the hazardous effects of mould 
exposure, ensure that your home 
stays as dry as possible to prevent 
growth and seal off areas that are 
infested until they are cleaned. Toss 
any food that has begun to grow a 
mould colony and don’t just scrape 
it off the top... mould mycelium can 
burrow much deeper into food than 
you think.

Slimy mystery
These unusual moulds have strange abilities
It can take less than a day for black 
mould to appear on damp walls
lowly crawling along the 
forest floor are a diverse 
group of organisms we’ve 
come to know as slime mould. 
These unusual life forms were 
once thought to be a type of 
fungus. However, scientists have discovered 
that they belong to another group called 
Protozoa. This group of organisms includes 
free-moving single-celled organisms such as 
amoebae. Once slime mould has matured, it 
will cease to move and bear sporangia ‘fruits’, 
similar to moulds. These fruits will then release 
spores that will go on to grow into new slime 
moulds. However, unlike mould and other 
fungi, slime moulds don’t have penetrating 
hyphae to dig into wood and extract nutrients. 
Instead their amoeba-like movements allow 
them to freely crawl their way along the 
surfaces of plants and trees, engulfing bacteria
along the way. One slime mould, Physarum 
polycephalum - nicknamed ‘the blob’ - has 
piqued the interest of scientists. Despite not 
having a brain or nerve cells, scientists have 
discovered that this strange slime remembers 
things and can solve mazes. It’s not yet fully 
understood how the slime mould retains this 
kind of information.

 Sporangia

The spore-bearing 
structures begin to sprout 
from a mature mass of 
slime mould, called 
a plasmodium.
Spore release
Once a sporangium 
is fully formed and filled 
with spores it ruptures, 
releasing them onto 
nearby decaying wood.
Growing 
slime mould
How a bunch of cells come together 
to form this odd organism
emerge - either an 
amoeboid cell under dry 
conditions or a flagellating 
cell under wet conditions.
Conversion
If necessary, either 
the amoeboid cells or 
flagellated cells can 
transform into the other to 
suit a change in their 
environment.
Feeding
During the amoeba 
stage of their lives, slime 
moulds will feed on 
bacteria until food 
becomes scarce.
When their food runs 
out and the amoebae 
begin to starve, they fuse 
together, rapidly 
multiplying and 
forming a larger body 
known as a plasmodium.
When mature, the 
multicellular plasmodium 
will begin to spread out 
into a netting shape in 
preparation to grow 
sporangia and release 
spores.

giant puffball (Calvatia 
gigantea) during its 
reproductive stage 
of life. False 
puffballs are often 
found hanging 
from dead trees.

The vibrant red ‘fruits’ of 
this slime mould 
resemble sponge-like 
loofahs. They release 
their spores onto 
nearby decaying 
wood for their 
amoeba 
hatchlings to feast 
on the bacteria 
within.
(Tubifera 
ferruginosa)
The sporangia of this 
slime mould are so 
tightly packed together 
that they resemble a 
raspberry. The 
vibrant sporangia 
eventually turn a 
purplish-brown 
before releasing 
spores.
(Ceratiomyxa 
fruticulosa)
Found in forests around 
the world, this slime 
mould transforms 
its body into 
icicle-like stalks 
that bear the 
mould’s spores.
