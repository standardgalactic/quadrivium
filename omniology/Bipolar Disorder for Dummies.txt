About the Authors
Candida Fink, MD (New Rochelle, New York) is a Board Certified Adult,
Child, and Adolescent Psychiatrist in private practice in the New York 
area. Dr. Fink graduated from Boston University Medical School and did her
postgraduate training through Harvard Medical School. She’s currently an
Assistant Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at Westchester Medical College. She
has worked extensively with children and adults with complicated psychi-
atric illnesses. Mood disorders, especially the diagnostic and treatment ques-
tions surrounding bipolar disorder, comprise much of her practice. She also
works extensively with schools and other institutions regarding developmen-
tal and psychiatric issues. Dr. Fink grew up with mood disorders in her family,
so she has seen them from every angle and knows the importance of mobiliz-
ing the family as a part of any successful treatment. She has previously co-
authored, with Judith Lederman, The Ups and Downs of Raising a Bipolar
Child: A Survival Guide for Parents (Fireside). She frequently consults and
speaks on bipolar disorder in children. 
Joe Kraynak, MA (Speedway, Indiana) is a freelance author who has written
and co-authored dozens of books on topics ranging from slam poetry to per-
sonal computers. Joe received his degree in bipolar disorder from the College
of Hard Knocks. On December 10, 1999, Joe’s wife, Cecie, a Spanish teacher at
the time, was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Since that day, they have
bounced around to a half dozen doctors and even more therapists, broke in a
few young marriage counselors, survived several changes in health insurance
coverage, attended dozens of support group meetings, and endured the
career changes and financial hardships that commonly accompany bipolar
disorder. In this book, Joe offers his experience and insight from life in the
trenches. 
Dedications
From Candida: To my Mom, who loved and taught with compassion and self-
lessness that profoundly changed all who knew her. She was my rock, and
she’s deeply missed.
From Joe: To my wife, Cecie, whose zest for life and genuine interest in the
lives of others engage and inspire everyone she touches.


Authors’ Acknowledgments
Although we wrote the book, dozens of other talented individuals con-
tributed to its conception, development, and perfection. Special thanks goes
to Mikal Belicove, who chose us to author this book; Mikal has an uncanny
knack for connecting authors who work well together and enjoy the experi-
ence. Chrissy Guthrie, project editor, deserves a round of applause for acting
as the choreographer — developing chapters, shepherding the text and illus-
trations through production, making sure any technical issues were properly
addressed, and serving as unofficial quality control manager. Thanks also to
Josh Dials, our copy editor, who read through everything — forward and
backward — to identify and obliterate our many grammatical goofs and
typos. We also tip our hats to the folks in Composition Services at Wiley for
doing such an outstanding job of transforming a loose collection of text and
illustrations into such an attractive volume.
We owe special thanks to our technical editors for ferreting out technical
errors in the manuscript and helping guide its content:
Ellen Frank, PhD, professor of psychiatry and psychology at the University of
Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, and
Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance scientific advisory board chair. 
Paul E. Keck, Jr., MD, professor and vice chairman for Research, Department
of Psychiatry, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, and a Depression
and Bipolar Support Alliance scientific advisory board member.
And thanks to Laura Hoofnagle, publications manager, and Susan R. Bergeson,
vice president of the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, Chicago,
Illinois, for their assistance in ensuring the technical accuracy of the material. 
And we thank our agent, Faith Hamlin, of Sanford J. Greenburger Associates,
Inc., for managing the contract negotiations so we could focus on writing
rather than the legal stuff.
We would also like to thank all the people with bipolar disorder and their
family members and friends whom we’ve met along the way. Without these
brave souls, along with their stories, their struggles, and their achievements,
this book wouldn’t be possible. And we acknowledge nonprofit organizations,
including the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance (DBSA), the Child and
Adolescent Bipolar Foundation, and the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill
(NAMI), for their valuable contributions and continued dedication to educat-
ing, supporting, and advocating for all those in the bipolar community.

Introduction
I
magine yourself cruising down the highway at a comfortable speed of 65
miles per hour when your cruise control goes berserk. The speedometer
climbs to 75 and then 85 . . . you hit the button to cancel . . . tap the brakes . . .
nothing slows you down . . . 95 . . . your car is shaking and weaving . . . 100 . . .
people are honking . . . 105 . . . police are chasing you . . . 110 . . . your spouse
is yelling at you to SLOW DOWN . . . 115 . . . 120 . . . 
Or imagine the opposite: You’re driving through town, 30 mile-per-hour speed
limit, nobody in front of you, and your car can only go 3 miles per hour. You’re
practically pushing the accelerator through the floor, but you can only get it
up to 5 miles per hour . . . downhill! Your neighbors are honking, passing you
on the right — on bicycles — giving you dirty looks and other gestures of 
discontent.
When you have bipolar disorder, your brain’s accelerator is stuck. At full
speed, it launches you into a manic episode. In slow gear, it grinds you down
into a deep depression. If this were your heart, somebody would call the
ambulance, doctors and nurses would flock to your bedside, loved ones
would fly in from other states, and you’d get flowers and fruit baskets. But
when your brain is stuck in park or overdrive, people just think you’re lazy,
you’ve snapped, or you’re too weak to deal with life. Instead of flowers and
fruit baskets, you get a pink slip and divorce papers.
The good news is that the mind mechanics — psychiatrists, psychologists,
and therapists — have toolboxes packed with medications and therapies that
can repair your brain’s accelerator. In this book, we reveal those tools, along
with strategies and techniques that you can use to achieve and maintain mood
stability and to help yourself feel a whole lot better.
About This Book
This book is more than a repair manual for the bipolar brain. Sure, we dis-
cuss diagnoses and treatments, available medications and therapies, and the
lifestyle changes that can help you cope. But we also go beyond that to reveal
some of the causes and consequences of bipolar disorder, let you in on some
crisis-survival strategies, and describe ways that friends and family members
can support loved ones who have bipolar disorder. Our goal is to help you
develop a deeper understanding of bipolar disorder and its symptoms and
empower you to take more control of your treatment, eliminate your symp-
toms, and regain your ability to function.

In the quest to make you or your loved one feel better and maintain stable
moods, we focus on the three Cs of bipolar disorder:
 Continuity of treatment: In this era of specialization and managed
healthcare, patients often get shuttled from one doctor or therapist to
another, and each professional may have a unique approach. Any drastic
changes to medication or therapy can upset the balance, so this book
encourages you to develop a treatment plan that all your caregivers
follow and that remains with you when you change doctors or therapists.
 Comprehensive treatment: The most effective treatment plan calls for a
three-pronged attack of medication, therapy, and lifestyle change. In this
book, we explain why your treatment plan should address all three fac-
tors, and we reveal the most effective medications, therapies, peer sup-
port options, and lifestyle changes currently available.
 Coordinated treatment: Communication is the key to coordinated treat-
ment, and communication breakdowns are at the root of most failed
attempts. To ensure success, communicate openly and honestly with
your doctor, therapist, and loved ones and encourage them to communi-
cate with one another. Throughout the book, we reveal techniques to
improve communication among all members of your treatment team.
Of course, this book is no replacement for professional psychiatric care. (We
kicked around the idea of bundling the book with a blank prescription pad, but
our publisher nixed the idea.) Even so, Bipolar Disorder For Dummies can help
you gain a better understanding of your treatment choices so you can build a
more cooperative and productive relationship with your healthcare providers.
Conventions Used in This Book
We don’t like to think of our book as conventional, but we do have some stan-
dard ways of presenting material. For example:
 Whenever we introduce a new, somewhat technical term, such as
expressed emotion, we display it in italics. We enclose a commonly used
term that’s not necessarily a technical term “in quotes.” If you’re reading
the book aloud or your lips are moving, make the finger gesture for
quotes to get the full effect.
 Web and e-mail addresses appear in monofont to help them stand out
on the page for easy access.
 In almost every chapter, we include stories about people who have bipo-
lar disorder and their loved ones. These stories aren’t necessarily about
real people — they represent composites of real people we’ve met and
worked with over the years.

Bipolar Disorder For Dummies 

What You’re Not to Read
You can skip any text we mark with a Technical Stuff icon because the only
people who really care about this stuff are doctors and the lawyers who want
to sue the doctors. And sidebars are just what the name implies. They give
you somewhere to hang out when you don’t have somewhere else to go or
something better to do. Most of our sidebars tell stories that are sort of based
on reality, and they’re about the most entertaining parts of the book, so be
selective in what you skip. Note: However, we don’t recommend that you skip
the sidebars with Bipolar Bio icons next to them.
Foolish Assumptions
When you (or loved ones) are diagnosed with bipolar disorder, you automati-
cally become a rank beginner. You never needed the information before and
probably had little interest in the topic. Now you need to get up to speed in a
hurry. With that in mind, the biggest foolish assumption we make in this book
is that you know very little about bipolar disorder. If you’ve been to a doctor
or therapist and have already received a diagnosis, however, you know at
least a little. And if you got burned by a misdiagnosis or the wrong approach,
you know that you don’t want it to happen again. But no matter what level
you’re at, this book can help. 
We also assume that you or someone you know has bipolar disorder or that
you’re at least somewhat curious about it. The more bipolar disorder affects
you, your family, or someone you know, the more this book helps.
Finally, we assume that you have a sense of humor. According to Jean de la
Bruyère, “Life is a tragedy for those who feel and a comedy for those who
think.” We’re thinking people. We laugh through our tears rather than wallow
in our misery, although we, too, have shed our fair share of tears. We have
loved ones with bipolar disorder, and we know it’s painful for everyone
involved, but we’ve found that most people with bipolar disorder and their
loved ones have a healthy sense of humor. Maybe it’s because they’re
smarter than the average Joe, or perhaps they’ve just had to deal with so
much bad stuff in their lives that they need a moment to laugh.
In this book, we wanted to strip away all the politically correct niceties and
namby-pamby psychospeak. We chose not to sweeten the bitter facts with
butter-cream frosting, and we don’t hesitate to laugh at the absurdities of
living with bipolar disorder. We certainly hope that you won’t find any of this
more than mildly offensive and that you’ll indulge in a few laughs yourself.

Introduction

How This Book Is Organized
We wrote this book so you could approach it two ways. You can pick the
book up and flip to any chapter for a quick, stand-alone mini-course on a spe-
cific bipolar topic, or you can read the book from cover to cover. To help you
navigate, we divided the chapters that make up the book into six parts. Here,
we provide a quick overview of what we cover in each part.
Part I: Boning Up on Bipolar Disorder
The three chapters in this part comprise a quick overview of bipolar disor-
der. You begin to discover the characteristics of bipolar disorder and how it
affects people who have it and their families. We lift the curtain on the diag-
nosis to reveal the various ways that bipolar disorder presents itself and the
leading theories on what causes it. We introduce some of the most effective
treatments, explain why prevention plays such a critical role in treatment,
and discuss the positive prognosis that you can expect with the right combi-
nation of medication, therapy, and lifestyle adjustments.
Part II: Taming the Bipolar Beast
A half-hour discussion with a doctor or therapist may be enough to raise 
suspicions of bipolar disorder, but it’s certainly insufficient for obtaining an
accurate diagnosis. First, you need to see your family physician to rule out
other possible causes. Any of several physical ailments can cause symptoms
similar to those that come with bipolar disorder, and you need a physical
exam and appropriate lab tests to rule them out. In this part, we lay out the
process you must go through to obtain an accurate diagnosis. We also show
you how to assemble your very own mood-management team, complete with
a doctor, therapist, and dedicated friends and family members to help tame
the bipolar beast.
Part III: Opening the Treatment Toolbox: 
A Comprehensive, Integrated Approach
Successfully managing bipolar disorder and maintaining mood stability
require a combination of medication and therapy. This part begins by provid-
ing an overview of available medications for treating both “poles” of bipolar
disorder: mania and depression. Even more valuable than the list of effective
medications and their potential side effects is the primer we provide on bipo-
lar psychopharmacology. We tell you which questions to ask your doctor to
help you make informed decisions, diminish undesirable side effects, and
4
Bipolar Disorder For Dummies 

safely combine medications. We also discuss types of individual and family
therapies that have proved useful in preventing relapses. Finally, we provide
an overview of alternative treatments to help you distinguish useful supple-
mentary treatments from opportunistic quackery.
Part IV: Helping Yourself
The most valiant efforts of a doctor and therapist to control bipolar symp-
toms are no match for what patients can do to undermine their own health.
Successful treatment requires the person with bipolar disorder to play an
active role. In this part, we show you how to take control of your treatment.
You discover how to identify common warning signs of an impending mood
episode, respond quickly and appropriately, identify stressors and triggers
that affect your moods, restructure your life, care for yourself, incorporate
peer support into your recovery, and adhere to the recommended regimen of
medication and therapy.
Part V: Assisting a Friend or Relative 
with Bipolar Disorder
If you’re reading this book because you have a friend, significant other, or rel-
ative with bipolar disorder, this part is for you. We both have family members
with bipolar disorder, and we know firsthand just how difficult it is to walk
the fine line between over and underinvolvement. The chapters in this part
explain what you can and can’t do to help, how you can establish an environ-
ment of open communication and cooperation with your loved one, and how
to prepare for and respond to a crisis. If you have a child diagnosed with
bipolar disorder or another psychiatric disorder or if your child is experienc-
ing unexplained behavioral problems at home, school, or with friends, you
won’t want to miss Chapter 18, which explains the challenges of diagnosing,
treating, and parenting children with bipolar disorder.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Before you head out to see your psychiatrist or therapist, turn to this section
for a quick list of 10 questions you should ask. And if you can’t pay the bill,
this part provides 10 affordable treatment options and sources of financial
assistance. When your life calms down and you have time to advocate for the
bipolar community, flip to this section to discover 10 ways you can become
more involved in the cause.
As if all this other stuff weren’t enough, we also include a handy glossary at the
end of this book that defines commonly used terms related to bipolar disorder.

Introduction

Icons Used in This Book
Throughout this book, we sprinkle the following icons in the margins to cue
you in to different types of information that call out for your attention: 
You can forget the rest of the stuff in this book, but you should remember any-
thing that we mark with one of these icons.
Tips provide insider insight from behind the scenes. When you’re looking for
a better, faster way to do something, check out these tips.
“Danger, Will Robinson, danger!” This icon appears when you need to be
extra vigilant or seek professional help.
Throughout the book, we feature cameo performances of people with bipolar
disorder and their families. This icon shows you where to meet them.
When an explanation is more technical than even the technical material we
cover in the text, we flag it with one of these icons so you can avoid it (unless
you’re really into superfluous information).
Where to Go from Here
Think of this book as an all-you-can-eat buffet. You can grab a plate, start at
the beginning, and read one chapter right after another, or you can dip into
any chapter and pile your plate high with the information it contains.
If you want a quick overview of bipolar disorder, check out the chapters in
Part I. Before you visit a psychiatrist for a diagnosis, check out Chapters 4, 
5, and 19. If you have a friend or family member with bipolar disorder, skip 
to Part V. Wherever you choose to go, you find plenty of useful information
and advice.

In this part . . .
T
ake a crash course in bipolar disorder, from the onset
and diagnosis to treatment and recovery. The three
chapters in this part reveal the many masks of bipolar dis-
order, including Bipolar I, Bipolar II, Cyclothymic disorder,
and Bipolar NOS. You discover the official signs and symp-
toms of depression, hypomania, and mania and how to
distinguish between a bad day at work and a bona fide
mood episode. And you find out where bipolar disorder
comes from, what triggers it, and how likely or unlikely it
is that you have it.
We also unveil the positive prognosis that accompanies
the bipolar diagnosis and the conventional treatments
currently being developed to successfully treat its most
sinister symptoms. And, after you hop on the road to recov-
ery, we provide techniques and tips to steady your course.

In This Chapter
 Navigating the wild mood swings of bipolar disorder

 Controlling your moods with medications and therapy
 Tackling the future with careful planning and prevention techniques
 Supporting a loved one with bipolar disorder
 Caring for children or adolescents with bipolar disorder
B
ipolar disorder is a heartless beast that parties with your life and sticks
you with the bill. At its best, it inspires brilliant insights and uninhibited
joy. At its worst, it drapes the mind in debilitating depression, destroys rela-
tionships, empties bank accounts, and fuels suicidal thoughts. Doctors have
no test for it and no cure, and one of the main symptoms of the disorder is
that the afflicted often deny they have it and resist treatment.
Science knows few more elusive diseases, yet mental health professionals 
are more skilled than ever at accurately diagnosing bipolar disorder and suc-
cessfully treating it with the right combination of medicine, therapy, and life
changes. Many people with bipolar disorder can now live productive lives and
achieve levels of happiness and fulfillment they had never dreamed possible.
In this chapter, we reveal a few of the many manifestations of bipolar disorder
and describe its most challenging aspects. We lead you on a brief journey of
what a person with bipolar disorder can expect — from diagnosis through
prognosis and on to treatment and recovery. And because successful treat-
ment and recovery often require the participation of loved ones, this chapter
shows you what you can do to support a friend, relative, or child who has
bipolar disorder.

Riding the Bipolar Waves
Some people are so persistently perky that you want to slap them. Most
others experience the normal ups and downs of everyday living. You lose
your job, and you feel a little dejected. You win the lottery, and you feel ecsta-
tic . . . at least until you blow all the money. Minor fluctuations in mood are
normal. Even major fluctuations are normal, as long as they don’t last too
long or interfere with your ability to function and enjoy pleasurable activities.
A temporary bout of unhappiness can even prompt you to make a positive
change in your life that leads to greater happiness and self-fulfillment.
If you suffer from bipolar disorder, you also experience the normal ups and
downs of everyday living, but sometimes the ups and downs exceed the
healthy, socially acceptable limits and persist for inordinate amounts of time.
Finding your comfort level
As Figure 1-1 shows, most people experience mood swings to some accept-
able degree, but bipolar mood swings are amplified and extend way past the
comfort level, to the point where they impair the person’s ability to function
and enjoy life.
Of course, intensity of mood alone, especially when it’s on the rise, isn’t always
problematic. In fact, many people who experience hypomania — an elevated
state of mood and energy that doesn’t qualify as full-blown mania — report
that their creative drives and clarity of vision are quite exhilarating. Hypomania
can often make you more extroverted, entertaining, and engaging. It can
increase your sex appeal and make you feel more powerful. It can energize
and invigorate, help you focus, and inspire creative vision.

Part I: Boning Up on Bipolar Disorder 

The trick to treating bipolar disorder isn’t to flat-line your moods and ener-
gies. You want to bring the fluctuations into a range that’s acceptable to you
and the people who are important to you. You want to ride the waves without
being dragged under and without eliminating them entirely.
Crashing on the rocks
When you suffer from bipolar disorder, your mood can occasionally fluctuate
way beyond normal. One day you’re nimbly surfing the sea of life, and the
next day a massive wave rises up and smashes you against the rocks. A deep
depression can wrap you in despair and sentence you to endless days in bed.
A full-blown manic episode can buck you like a raging bull and then toss your
exhausted carcass in the trash heap. Whether you fly up or plummet down,
an extreme, prolonged mood episode can cause you to crash, which can be
devastating to your perceptions, emotions, relationships, career, and other
aspects of your life.
Whether you crash via a wave of mania or get swept away by the undercur-
rents of depression, intervention is usually required in the form of medica-
tion, therapy, or a brief stay in the hospital (in extreme cases). However, the
preferred method is to avoid the crash altogether by obtaining an accurate
diagnosis and receiving preventive treatment and therapy.
Uncontrollable mania
Manic episodes seem to garner all the press, because their stories are often
titillating. In episodes of mania, people often rise above the monotony of the
moment, pumped up with the following feelings and beliefs:
 I am amazing!
 Everything is wonderful!
 I can do anything and everything!
 I have all the answers! My ideas will change the world!
 No matter what bad things I do, I’m still a great person!
 Sleep is only for people who have nothing better to do!
 I’m always right!
 Everybody loves me!
 I’m the fastest at everything I do!
However, full-blown manic episodes often are accompanied by paranoia and
other psychoses that compound the problem. A person may become con-
sumed with thoughts of religious martyrdom or government plots. He or she
may believe family members, friends, or even strangers have ill or dangerous
11
Chapter 1: Living La Vida Bipolar

intentions. Left to run its course, mania often results in a crash, leaving the
victim feeling depressed and physically and mentally exhausted. The episode
can also foul up the victim’s personal and professional relationships and
financial status.
Debilitating depression
Depression is the opposite of thrilling. It can make you feel like you’re trudg-
ing through the quagmire of life in a lead suit. It dulls your senses and bars
you from experiencing any of life’s pleasures. You become the resident party
pooper, the proverbial wet blanket. If you had the energy to talk, you’d
express your feelings as follows:
 I’m terrible.
 Everything is horrible.
 I can’t do anything.
 I’m a bad, evil person, even when I don’t do anything bad.
 I can’t sleep.
 I can’t get up.
 Even little things take forever to do.
 Nobody loves me.
 Everything’s my fault.
 Nothing feels good.
If you’re lucky, the depression eventually burns off like the morning fog. If it
deepens, it can lead to a crash, leaving you feeling even more depressed and
physically and mentally exhausted.
When most people think of bipolar disorder, they think of the manic side.
However, depression is the more common and more damaging of the two
poles. In the euphoria of mania, people rarely choose to intentionally harm
themselves. In a deep depression, however, self-mutilation and suicidal
thoughts and actions are far too common.
Maddening mixed states
A somewhat perplexing cycle in bipolar disorder is the mixed state, a condi-
tion with characteristics of both mania and depression. During a mixed state,
your thoughts may go a mile a minute, but they’re all angry or miserable. You
may have big ideas but no energy to carry them out or plenty of energy to
fuel your irritability. You may even believe that your imminent death is part
of some master plan.
12
Part I: Boning Up on Bipolar Disorder 

Earning Your Bipolar Badge
To begin the process of treating and regulating your bipolar disorder, you
need an official diagnosis, and obtaining it can be quite a lengthy process.
Coming to terms with the problem
The first step toward a diagnosis is to realize that something isn’t right.
Acceptance is usually the most time-consuming step. Most people live with
bipolar disorder for an average of 10 years before seeking help. In many
cases, people experience multiple major mood episodes — depression or
mania — before circumstances or frustrated family members force them to
seek professional help.
People with bipolar disorder may avoid seeking treatment for any of several
reasons:
 Mania feels great. I’ve never felt so energized!
 Why bother? Nothing can possibly make me feel any better.
 I’m not ill. I’m just weak. I need to work harder at overcoming this.
 I can deal with this on my own.
 I can’t afford any more bills.
 I don’t want to be labeled.
Both depression and mania can influence thought patterns that make a
person avoid treatment. In a manic episode, you commonly feel all-knowing,
all-powerful, full of energy, and at the top of your game. In such a state, few
people think they need help. When you feel deeply depressed, you commonly
lose hope in the future and begin thinking that nothing can improve your life,
so it’s understandable not to seek help. In many cases, you need to experi-
ence a crash or a loved one has to intervene to provide the motivation to
seek professional help.
Obtaining an accurate diagnosis
After you decide that you need professional help, you can begin the process
of obtaining an accurate diagnosis. This process typically entails the follow-
ing steps:
13
Chapter 1: Living La Vida Bipolar

1. Visit your physician.
Other health issues, such as thyroid malfunction, menopause, or nutri-
tional deficiencies, can cause symptoms similar to those of bipolar dis-
order. Medications and other substances can also generate similar
symptoms. Your family physician can help rule out these and other pos-
sible causes of your symptoms. (Flip to Chapter 4 for more on this.)
2. Undergo a psychiatric evaluation.
A licensed psychiatrist can review your medical history, family history,
and symptoms and offer an initial diagnosis and treatment plan. (See
Chapter 5 for more on visiting the psychiatrist.)
Unfortunately, the steps for obtaining an accurate diagnosis and a treatment
plan that works aren’t always so linear. If you’re feeling deeply depressed,
manic, or agitated, your physician or psychiatrist may prescribe medication
to alleviate the symptoms immediately and work on the diagnosis later.
If you receive a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, your psychiatrist typically nar-
rows the diagnosis by specifying one of the following four flavors:
 Bipolar I: Requires at least one full-blown manic episode some time
during your life that doctors can’t attribute to another cause, such as a
medication or substance abuse. You may or may not have experienced a
major depressive episode.
 Bipolar II: Requires at least one major depressive episode some time
during your life that doctors can’t attribute to another cause. You must
also experience a hypomanic episode.
 Cyclothymic disorder: Requires multiple depressive and hypomanic
episodes not extreme enough to warrant a diagnosis of Bipolar I or II. In
some cases, the depression and mania occur simultaneously, resulting in
a state of chronic irritability.
 Bipolar NOS (Not Otherwise Specified): Requires manic or depressive
episodes that doctors can’t categorize as unipolar depression. The
episodes also can’t fit into any of the other bipolar categories.
Chapter 2 discusses each of these forms of the disorder in detail.
Mixing an Effective Bipolar Cocktail
Your psychiatrist’s treatment plan almost always prescribes medications
designed to treat your current state (manic, depressed, mixed) and to pre-
vent further cycles. Your job is to provide your doctor with detailed informa-
tion so she can choose the right medications for you and to stick with the
treatment plan. We cover all the bases in this section.
14
Part I: Boning Up on Bipolar Disorder 

Getting the right meds for your condition
Chapter 7 introduces you to the medications most commonly used to treat
bipolar disorder. The medications fall into the following categories:
 Antimanics: Antimanic medications, commonly referred to as mood sta-
bilizers, primarily treat the manic side of bipolar disorder. Your psychia-
trist may prescribe an antimanic medication to bring you down from the
highs of mania, or she may prescribe a maintenance dose as a prophy-
laxis (preventative). Lithium is the gold standard in the antimanic cate-
gory because it’s one of the few antimanic medications that doctors truly
consider a mood stabilizer; it can prevent depression as well as mania.
 Antidepressants: Antidepressants, such as Prozac, Paxil, and Wellbutrin,
treat the depressive side of bipolar disorder and are also used to treat
unipolar depression. Your psychiatrist may prescribe an antidepressant
to pull you out of an acute depressive episode or to prevent future
depressive episodes. Antidepressants can induce mania in some individ-
uals, so psychiatrists typically prescribe them only in combination with
an antimanic medication for patients with bipolar disorder.
 Antipsychotics: Antipsychotic medications, such as Zyprexa, may be
used to treat mania or psychotic symptoms that may accompany a
major manic or depressive episode.
 Sedatives: Psychiatrists commonly prescribe sedatives to alleviate anxi-
ety and to help patients sleep. As we discuss in Chapter 12, sleepless-
ness can often trigger a major mood episode, so psychiatrists are highly
motivated to help you sleep through the night.
Psychiatrists often prescribe multiple medications to treat all symptoms and
to improve the drugs’ overall effectiveness. Most people with bipolar disorder
15
Chapter 1: Living La Vida Bipolar
Clarifying the purpose of the bipolar label
If you’re like most people, you shun labels —
especially labels that carry negative connota-
tions, such as bipolar. Used in a sentence, such
as “Pat is bipolar,” the label seems even more
insensitive. It not only stigmatizes Pat, but also
reduces her to the illness itself. If Pat had cancer,
nobody would say, “Pat is cancer,” but people
often play fast and loose with the term “bipolar.”
Your physician or psychiatrist doesn’t use the
label “bipolar disorder” to label you or minimize
your worth as a human being. The label provides
a convenient way to refer to your condition that
requires treatment. It helps all the people
involved in your treatment plan to quickly rec-
ognize the disease that afflicts you and to pro-
vide the appropriate medications and therapy.
Always remember that you’re not bipolar disor-
der. Bipolar disorder is something you have, and
you can manage it with the right medication and
therapy.

take at least one antimanic medication along with an antidepressant. You may
take antipsychotics to further dampen the mania or to treat residual psy-
choses. Your psychiatrist may prescribe an antianxiety medication to allevi-
ate anxiety during the day and sedatives to help you sleep at night.
The prescription medication you take isn’t designed to cure bipolar disorder
or to solve all your problems. It’s designed to treat the physical side of the
disorder in your brain so the rest of your being can function without the
interference of mania or depression. When your brain begins functioning
more normally, you may be able to make some adjustments to your lifestyle
and attitudes that can accelerate your recovery, improve your life, and offer
additional protection against new episodes.
Sticking to the treatment plan — 
even when you don’t want to
Noncompliance — the tendency to stop taking your prescribed medications —
can undermine the most skillfully designed treatment plan. In addition to the
normal human proclivity to avoid swallowing pills, people with bipolar disor-
der often have some seemingly valid objections to taking their medications.
The following list discusses some of the most common objections and what
you should do if you find yourself thinking them:
 I feel fine. Psychiatrists prescribe many of the medications to prevent
recurrences of mood episodes that can worsen the course of the disor-
der. Of course, when you feel good, you don’t see a need to take medica-
tion. You have to fight a constant battle against your natural urge to
avoid taking your medication in order to remain healthy and prevent the
course of the illness from worsening.
 I can’t tolerate the side effects. The side effects of some medications for
bipolar disorder can be brutal: weight gain, memory loss, anxiety,
fatigue, loss of libido, and so on. Psychiatrists often help reduce or elimi-
nate undesirable side effects by adjusting the dosage, recommending a
different time to take the medicine, or changing medications.
 I forgot. When you’re trying to hold down a job, pay your bills, shore up
your relationships, and perform your daily chores, popping pills may not
seem like a priority, especially when you feel okay. Chapter 7 discusses
some ways to help you stay on top of your medications.
 I miss my mania. Because hypomania can be so exhilarating, an effec-
tive mood stabilizer can make life seem dull. The challenge is to estab-
lish a baseline level for your moods that enables you to feel vibrant and
creative without tumbling over the edge. You and your doctor can work
together to establish a baseline that’s comfortable for you.
16
Part I: Boning Up on Bipolar Disorder 

Although you may be tempted to tweak your medications on your own, don’t
do it. Always consult your psychiatrist before you adjust the dose or times of
day that she prescribes. In many cases, your psychiatrist can make a minor
adjustment that alleviates a troublesome side effect or improves the effec-
tiveness of the medication. Stopping a medication cold turkey can destabilize
your moods and cause other withdrawal symptoms.
Retooling Your Thoughts 
and Relationships
Some psychiatrists and mental-health activists describe bipolar disorder as a
mental illness caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain. Although this is
true, it doesn’t mean that if you repair the chemical imbalance through med-
ication, you eliminate the illness for good.
Unfortunately, bipolar disorder is much more complicated than that. Yes, bal-
ancing brain chemistry is essential, but your brain doesn’t live in a petri dish;
it lives inside your body. It registers what your eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and
fingers perceive. It processes your interactions with others and generates
your emotions and thoughts. In short, your experiences influence your brain
as much as your brain influences your experiences. And both your brain and
your experiences affect your moods.
Bathing your brain in the right mix of medications helps it maintain normal
function, but if you and those around you assault your brain with negative
emotions, conflict, and sleep deprivation, no combination of medications can
possibly overcome the stress.
In addition to proper medications, you need to receive the right therapy or
combination of therapies, such as the following, to reduce the impact of
stress on your brain:
 Psychoeducation: Finding out more about bipolar disorder often helps
patients become comfortable with the diagnosis, hopeful about the
prognosis, and more willing and able to adhere to the treatment plan.
 Cognitive therapy: Identifies negative thought patterns and teaches
your mind to follow a positive train of thought. As we discuss in Chap-
ter 8, cognitive therapy is especially effective in treating depression.
 Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy: Living a structured lifestyle
and establishing healthy routines can give your life a rhythm that’s con-
ducive to mood stability. Studies show that mood episodes commonly
erupt when you experience stressful life changes that break down your
17
Chapter 1: Living La Vida Bipolar

natural rhythms and often lead to loss of sleep. Interpersonal and social
rhythm therapy strives to restore the rhythm to your life.
 Couples therapy: A rocky relationship with your main squeeze can whip
your emotions into a frenzy, especially if your significant other is abu-
sive. Couples therapy addresses areas of conflict and helps couples
establish effective communication techniques that reduce stress.
 Family therapy: If you live in the same house or spend a lot of time with
family members, educating them about bipolar disorder and your needs
is essential to your mental health. The more your family members know
about bipolar disorder and the stressors that can trigger major mood
episodes, the more they can do to help alleviate stress and support you
in your journey toward recovery.
 Financial counseling: Money doesn’t matter only to people who have
plenty of it. For most of us, a lack of sufficient funds can be a prime
source of stress and conflict. A good financial adviser may be able to
help you manage your finances.
 Career coaching: If your job is killing you, you may need a change. Being
stuck in a dead-end job with a jerk for a boss isn’t conducive to mental
health. Maybe you can’t up and quit right away, but you can start look-
ing around. A career coach or counselor can help you find healthier
employment.
 Lifestyle changes: Streamlining your life can alleviate the stress that
comes with owning and maintaining too much. A good therapist can
help you avoid overcommitting your time and resources.
Although medication is an essential component to recovery, it alone can’t
always overcome the fundamental problems that trigger mood episodes. You
may not be able to eliminate all sources of stress, but the more stress you
can eliminate or reduce, the better your chances of avoiding a relapse.
Tracking and Managing Your Moods
In business, the pencil-pushers like to plot data on a chart. Raw data is rela-
tively meaningless, but when you chart data, patterns begin to emerge, and the
data begins to have meaning. Charting your moods can help reveal similar pat-
terns that highlight seasons of the year or events in your life that often trigger
mood fluctuations. You can use this information to draw up plans to head off
mood episodes. For example, you may decide to spend a quiet Christmas at
home rather than with your dysfunctional relatives, or your psychiatrist may
give you something to help you sleep during a stressful period of your life.
In Chapter 12, we describe mood charts in greater detail and provide a
sample mood chart that you can begin using right away. If you prefer, you can
design your own mood chart. Try to include the following elements:
18
Part I: Boning Up on Bipolar Disorder 

 Scale: Rate your mood on a scale from +3 to –3, with 0 as your baseline,
feeling-okay level. If you rate a +3, you’re crawling-out-of-your-skin
manic, and if you’re –3, you’re barely-can-lift-the-pen depressed. (Use +5
to –5 or +10 to –10 if you have more shades to your mood spectrum.)
 Dates: Record your mood rating at least once a day. If your moods fluc-
tuate throughout the day, consider adding a little more detail.
 Notes: If you do anything out of the ordinary on a particular day, note it.
Note any changes in medication, diet, or need for sleep as well.
Knowledge is power. The more you know about the way you feel and how you
respond to variations in sleep, diet, medication, or activity, the more control
you have over bipolar disorder.
Share your mood chart with your psychiatrist, therapist, and anyone else
who you count as part of your support network (see Chapter 6). Others may
be able to identify patterns that you miss.
Reclaiming Your Life — 
When You’re Ready
Experiencing a major manic or depressive episode is like getting t-boned by an
18-wheeler. If you could turn yourself inside out, you’d see your bruised and
battered self and maybe garner a little well-deserved sympathy. Unfortunately,
others may perceive you as a person perfectly capable of returning to your
home and job. To compound the problem, a major mood episode often leaves
behind substantial collateral damage. Your loved ones may feel angry or
guilty. Your boss may consider you a liability. And you may still be wrestling
with the side effects of the most recent medication adjustment.
At this point, you may feel that you have a responsibility as a loyal employee
or family member to patch yourself up and return to service, and if that’s
what you really want to do, it may be best for you. In most cases, however,
being selfish pays greater long-term dividends. Taking some time off work to
recuperate, enable your moods to stabilize, and pay some attention to your
emotional and psychological needs can lead to a full recovery with a much
more positive long-term prognosis. To make your convalescence as success-
ful as possible, consider the following tips and techniques:
 Find alternate living arrangements, if necessary. If you live alone or in
a stressful environment, consider moving in with a close friend or relative
until your moods and medications stabilize. A strong support person
can help you monitor your moods, remind you to take your medications,
and offer moral support.
19
Chapter 1: Living La Vida Bipolar

 Contact your company’s human resources department. You may be 
eligible for a leave of absence during your recovery if your doctor pre-
scribes it. You should also check your health benefits. Don’t quit your
job, even if you think it contributes to your illness. Get the benefits you
deserve and then quit when you find something better. Work the system.
 Enroll in intensive outpatient therapy. Many hospitals and clinics offer
intensive outpatient therapy that can help you deal with the issues in
your life while you recover physically from the trauma. If you take a
leave of absence from work, intensive outpatient therapy keeps you
busy during the day and provides all-important human contact.
Avoid making any major decisions during your convalescence, such as quit-
ting your job or breaking off a relationship. Focus on becoming healthy. You
can deal more effectively with your issues when you feel fully recovered.
Preventing Suicide and Other 
Self-Damaging Behaviors
Thoughts about death and suicide, plans to commit suicide, and actual
attempts to take one’s own life accompany all phases of bipolar disorder.
Feelings of anxiety, hopelessness, and seemingly unbearable pain during
depressions; irritability and thoughts that race faster than you can think
them during manias; and paranoia and life-darkening hopelessness during
mixed states all contribute to suicidal thoughts. These thoughts may rush
into your head all at once and overwhelm you, or they may become obses-
sions that occupy most of your waking moments.
Other self-damaging behaviors, such as overspending or indulging in risky
sexual activity, can complicate or inflame suicidal thoughts.
If thoughts of death or suicide plague you, seek help immediately. If you sus-
pect that a loved one may be considering suicide, contact the person’s psychi-
atrist, doctor, or therapist immediately. If you don’t know what people to call,
drive the person to the nearest emergency room or call 911. Studies show that
nearly 30 percent of people suffering from bipolar depression attempt suicide,
so you need to act immediately. Although you may be able to talk your loved
one out of attempting suicide, he or she may lie to you just to get you out of
the way. Chapter 17 offers some suggestions for how to respond in a crisis.
When experiencing a manic episode or hypomania, you may behave in ways
that you never imagined you would. Mania can drive you to make imprudent
decisions that you live to regret. To make a serious mistake, you need motive,
method, and opportunity. In a state of mania, your motive is out of your con-
trol, so you need to work on eliminating the method and opportunity. Try the
following techniques:
20
Part I: Boning Up on Bipolar Disorder 

 Destroy your credit cards. They make it too easy to spend money you
don’t have.
 Limit access to your bank account. If you can’t withdraw your money,
you can’t spend it. Place a loved one in charge of your finances.
 Hand over your car keys. You may speed and drive erratically during
manic episodes, or you may decide to drive to the airport and hop on a
plane to Burma.
 Buddy up with a conscience. Being alone during a manic episode is dan-
gerous in itself. Find a loyal, level-headed friend to accompany you on
any outings.
 Avoid alcohol and other mind-altering substances. Alcohol, marijuana,
ecstasy, cocaine, and other drugs tend to make you less inhibited. Less
inhibition plus mania equals trouble.
 Stay off the Internet. Chat rooms, investment sites, online casinos, and
a host of temptations line the streets of the information superhighway.
Even people with stable moods have trouble fending off the temptations.
For these tactics to work, you need to plan ahead and work with a close friend
or relative who can intervene before the risky behavior commences. See
Chapter 17 for instructions on how to draw up a contract for intervention.
Planning Ahead for a Possible Relapse
The last thing you want to think about when you’re recovering is having to
relive the hell of a major depressive, manic, or mixed episode. However, when
your moods and medications are stabilized, you have the perfect opportunity
to plan ahead. By planning in advance, you can often reduce the intensity and
duration of the next mood episode and accelerate your recovery. You may
even be able to short-circuit the episode and avoid it altogether.
Select one or more close friends or relatives to act as your support network
(see Chapter 6), and set aside a time to discuss your emergency plan. Be pre-
pared to provide them with the following information:
 Your psychiatrist’s phone number
 Your therapist’s phone number
 Your health insurance company’s phone number and your member ID
 The name of the hospital you prefer to go to, if hospitalization is necessary
 A list of warning signs that indicate you may need help
 A heartfelt promise that even though you may resist their help during
the mood episode, you won’t hold it against them later
21
Chapter 1: Living La Vida Bipolar

The more you educate the members of your support network about bipolar dis-
order, the better. They need to know up front that you may vehemently protest
against their involvement when you need their help the most. Encourage them
to read this book or obtain information from other resources or bipolar sup-
port groups. (Chapter 21 helps you get involved in the bipolar community.)
Supporting a Friend or Relative 
with Bipolar Disorder
Bipolar disorder can make or break a relationship. Although bipolar is a dis-
order that causes suffering, it can also have benefits. People with bipolar dis-
order can often be the most creative, engaging, intelligent, life-affirming people
on the planet. They have fun, and their zest for life is contagious. You can
easily fall in love with them.
When someone you care about is in a deep depression, however, you may feel
as though the disorder is swallowing you both up into a bottomless pit of despair.
During a full-blown manic episode, the arrogance, anger, self-righteousness, or
emotional abuse your loved one displays may repel you. It’s important to keep
the disorder in perspective and maintain a healthy state of mind.
Establishing the right frame of mind
To support a friend or relative with bipolar disorder, the first step is to estab-
lish empathy and understand the control that the illness has over your friend
or relative. Following are a few important points to keep in mind:
 Your friend or relative probably wants this illness even less than you
want him to have it.
 When your friend or relative spews abusive or cutting remarks, the dis-
order is talking. Don’t take it personally.
 Taking it personally is normal, so don’t feel guilty if you slip. Being a
solid support person isn’t easy.
 The situation isn’t hopeless. With the right medication and therapy and
your support, you can get your friend or relative back, and he may
return even better than before!
 The more you know about bipolar disorder, the more you can accept it
and provide the proper support. By reading this book, you’re already
doing your job.
22
Part I: Boning Up on Bipolar Disorder 

Taking action
Here are some ideas for more practical, hands-on things you can do to help a
friend or relative with bipolar disorder:
 Attend a support group or class for friends or relatives of people with
bipolar disorder.
 Ask your friend or relative how involved he wants you to be.
 Be helpful without being intrusive.
 During times of crisis, offer to cook, clean, or take care of other 
necessities.
 Keep in touch.
 Offer to drive your friend or relative to appointments.
 Listen.
 Treat your friend or relative as you used to, before you knew about the
diagnosis.
Diagnosing and Treating a Child or
Adolescent with Bipolar Disorder
Bipolar disorder puts on a different mask when it afflicts a child or adoles-
cent. Children and teenagers have immature mood systems to start with; kids
are, by definition, less emotionally regulated than adults, so determining
bipolar patterns is very challenging. Children and adolescents may experi-
ence more mixed episodes with co-occurring depression and mania, or they
may have more background noise consisting of irritability and explosiveness
in addition to the cycles of mood episodes. A child’s mood episodes are often
briefer than an adult’s. (For more about how bipolar disorder affects chil-
dren, turn to Chapter 18.)
Because bipolar disorder often manifests itself differently in children and
adolescents than it does in adults, the diagnosis can be much more difficult
to make. Some symptoms can be similar to symptoms of other mental ill-
nesses, such as unipolar depression, ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder), or
ODD (Oppositional Defiant Disorder). Furthermore, the child or adolescent
may have two or more comorbid (co-existing) conditions — for example,
bipolar disorder and ADD. Bipolar disorder in children and adolescents com-
monly presents itself with the following symptoms:
23
Chapter 1: Living La Vida Bipolar

 Extended periods of sadness or irritability
 Extended periods of silliness/giddiness or raging anger
 Periods of high activity levels and/or racing thoughts or pressured
speech (the need to talk constantly)
 Exaggerated emotional sensitivity — huge emotional responses to 
little things
 Significant changes in sleep patterns and energy levels
 A cyclic quality to the mood and behavior changes classically seen over
a period of days to weeks rather than moment to moment
 Noticeable increase in risk taking and pleasure seeking
 Noticeable increase in withdrawal, isolation, or dropping activities
 History of difficult temperament in infancy/toddler periods
 Grandiose thinking: “I am great at everything!” or “I am better than
everyone!”
 Night terrors/sleep problems during early childhood
 Suicidal thoughts or self-injury
 Violence or threats to harm others
 Decline in function at school, home, or with friends
As we discuss in Chapter 18, obtaining an early, accurate diagnosis is the
most critical step in helping a child or adolescent with bipolar disorder. Too
often, a child or adolescent with bipolar disorder is misdiagnosed with ADD
or depression, and doctors place the children on medications that can
worsen the course of the illness.

ipolar disorder can make you feel blessed or cursed. It can boost your
moods to exhilarating new highs or dump you in the dungeon of
despair. It can also morph, becoming increasingly severe or going dormant
for years at a time.
Perhaps the most vexing aspect of bipolar disorder is that it manifests itself
only through thoughts, emotions, perceptions, speech, and behavior. Your
doctor can’t perform any medical test that proves beyond the shadow of a
doubt that you have bipolar disorder. Moreover, other medical conditions,
such as thyroid malfunction and substance abuse, can produce similar symp-
toms. And because bipolar disorder expresses itself internally through
thoughts, perceptions, and emotions and externally through speech and
behaviors, doctors and patients may be tempted to dismiss the illness as a
character flaw or personality defect.
Bipolar disorder, however, is a very real physical illness. It just happens to
affect the brain — one of the most complex parts of the human anatomy, one
of the most difficult parts to test, and one of the areas most sensitive to emo-
tional trauma and stress.
In this chapter, we explore the four principal bipolar diagnoses and define the
terms depression, mania, hypomania, and mixed state. We examine the biol-
ogy of bipolar disorder, illustrating the genetic vulnerability to the disease
and the brain physiology that causes the most severe symptoms. Because
external stimuli commonly trigger mood episodes, we look at some of the
stressors and triggers that can provoke depression or mania. Finally, we
introduce you to the positive prognosis that current medications and thera-
pies can offer.

Peeking Behind the Many Masks 
of Bipolar Disorder
Bipolar disorder wears many masks. It can be happy, sad, fearful, confident,
sexy, or furious. It can seduce strangers, intimidate bank tellers, throw
extravagant parties, and steal your joy late into the night. However, psychia-
trists have managed to bring order to the disorder by grouping the many
manifestations of bipolar disorder into four main categories: Bipolar I,
Bipolar II, Cyclothymic disorder, and Bipolar NOS (Not Otherwise Specified).
Don’t take the labels personally; they describe the disease, not the person,
and doctors use them to ensure that you receive appropriate, consistent
treatment. Medical doctors use similar labels all the time to make sure that if
you go into surgery to have your tonsils removed, for example, you don’t
wake up missing a kidney.
Bipolar I
To earn the Bipolar I label, you must experience at least one bout of mania or
a mixed-mood episode sometime during your life. The manic episode must
last at least one week, or it must be serious enough to require hospitalization.
It also must negatively affect some aspect of your life — your marriage, your
career, or your life savings — to some degree. Depression isn’t required,
although many people with Bipolar I have experienced a bout or two of major
depression at some point in their lives.
As we discuss later in this chapter, a bona-fide mania diagnosis hinges on
several conditions, which apply to any bipolar label you may receive. To be
considered a genuine manic episode, the mania must satisfy the following
conditions:
26
Part I: Boning Up on Bipolar Disorder 
You’re in good company
Bipolar disorder is often considered the Cadillac
of brain disorders, because so many famous
and creative individuals are thought to have 
suffered from it, including Vincent Van Gogh,
Abraham Lincoln, Winston Churchill, and
Virginia Woolf. Although this may be only a
small comfort when your symptoms are severe
and painful, it can give you a sense of kinship
with people who made an impact and help you
find and focus on the talents that make you
stand out in this world.
With advances in treatment, patients no longer
have to swap creativity for stability. In fact, most
people who are receiving treatment for bipolar
disorder find that they’re more consistently cre-
ative and productive with the right combination
of medication and therapy.

 The mania can’t be drug-induced. For example, if you were taking an
antidepressant, steroid, or cocaine at the time, the manic symptoms
don’t equal a diagnosis of bipolar disorder.
 Doctors can’t attribute the mania to an identifiable medical condition.
If you have a hormone imbalance that may be responsible for the manic
symptoms, for example, your doctor can’t make a definitive diagnosis of
bipolar disorder until you get that condition under control.
 Doctors can’t attribute the mania to schizoaffective disorder.
Schizoaffective disorder is a different illness. Its symptoms and treat-
ments can be similar to those of bipolar disorder, but other aspects,
such as the type and duration of the psychoses (including delusions or
hallucinations), are very different.
Many of the medicines designed to make you feel better can worsen your
condition or alter the course of your illness. SSRI (Selective Serotonin
Reuptake Inhibitor) antidepressants, for example, have helped thousands of
people overcome debilitating depressions, but they’ve also induced mania in
others. If an antidepressant induces mania, it may be a sign that you have
bipolar disorder. Your doctor is likely to become much more cautious when
prescribing antidepressants, and she may consider adding a mood stabilizer.
Chapter 7 helps you work with your doctor to decide what to do when the
medications that should help make your situation worse.
Bipolar II
Bipolar II is characterized by one or more episodes of major depression with
at least one episode of hypomania during a lifetime. The depressive episodes
must last at least two weeks, and the hypomania must last at least four days.
Hypomania is a milder form of mania, characterized by an increase in energy
and a heightened state of mind, which can often feel quite pleasant. This con-
dition can make you feel powerful, omniscient, creative, passionate, and unin-
hibited, but it can also be dysphoric — making you irritable, disorganized,
enraged, or terrified.
Hypomania doesn’t typically result in serious relationship problems or
extremely risky behavior, but your behavior can make people around you
more than a little uncomfortable.
Cyclothymic disorder
Cyclothymic disorder is a less extreme form of bipolar, sometimes referred to
as “bipolar lite,” that nevertheless chronically interferes with your life. It
involves multiple episodes of hypomania and depressive symptoms, which
don’t meet criteria for mania or major depression in intensity or duration.
27
Chapter 2: Demystifying Bipolar Disorder

Your symptoms must last for at least two years without more than two
months of stable, or euthymic, mood during that time.
Some people with Cyclothymic disorder go on to develop a full-blown manic,
mixed, or depressive episode, leading to an additional diagnosis of Bipolar I
or II. Preventive measures like therapy, lifestyle changes, and medication can
make a difference in the course of Cyclothymic disorder.
Bipolar NOS
The three bipolar classifications we cover up to this point are loosely para-
phrased from the DSM-IV — the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, 4th Edition, published by the American Psychiatric Association.
DSM-IV defines a fourth class, Bipolar NOS (Not Otherwise Specified), which
covers all other forms of bipolar disorder that don’t fall into any of the first
three categories.
The Bipolar NOS label often applies to the following cases:
 Rapid fluctuations in mood that may be intense enough to qualify as manic,
hypomanic, or depressive but that don’t fulfill the duration requirements
for a Bipolar I, Bipolar II, or Cyclothymic disorder diagnosis
 Hypomania without depression
 Mania or Cyclothymic disorder occurring simultaneously with schizo-
phrenia, Psychotic disorder NOS, or Delusional disorder (a disorder that
typically results in psychoses, hallucinations, and delusional thinking)
 Chronic depression and/or dysthymia (long-term, low-level depression)
accompanied by hypomanic episodes
Rapid cycling
Rapid cycling isn’t a separate type of bipolar disorder, but your doctor may
use the label to describe a particular subtype of Bipolar I or II. To qualify as 
a rapid-cycling sufferer, you must experience the following:
 You must experience four or more mood episodes (depression, mania,
hypomania, or mixed state) in a year.
 Your episodes must be full-blown versions — including typical duration
(see the following section).
 Your mania or mixed state must last at least one week or result in hospi-
talization; your depression must last at least two weeks; and your hypo-
mania must last at least four days. In other words, rapid cycling doesn’t
describe mood changes from minute to minute or hour to hour.
28
Part I: Boning Up on Bipolar Disorder 

Rapid cycling is the only manifestation of bipolar disorder to have a dis-
tinctly higher rate in women than men. All other bipolar disorders are 
equal-opportunity mental illnesses.
Not Your Average Moodiness:
Characteristics of Bipolar Disorder
Everyone experiences ups and downs, and some people are a little more
moody than others. That’s human nature, but it’s not what bipolar disorder is
all about. If you drag yourself into a psychiatrist’s office singing the blues,
she won’t hand you a prescription for an antidepressant. Likewise, if you stay
up all night playing poker and howling at the moon with your buddies, don’t
expect to receive a free sample of a mood stabilizer. Major depression, mania,
hypomania, and mixed mania are much more serious and more strictly defined.
Major depressive episode
Major depression makes you feel like you’re swimming in a sea of molasses.
Everything is slow, dark, and heavy. Along with criteria for the various cate-
gories of bipolar disorder, the DSM-IV (see the previous section) lays out the
criteria for a major depressive episode. Specifically, you must have five or
more of the following symptoms that last for at least two weeks straight:
 Depressed mood
 Markedly diminished interest in activities previously considered plea-
surable, including sex
 Five percent or more weight loss or weight gain in one month or less
when you’re not dieting, or a decrease or increase in appetite that lasts
for two weeks
 Sleeping too much or too little
 Moving uncharacteristically slow, both in mind and body
 Fatigue
 Feelings of worthlessness, excessive guilt, or inappropriate guilt (if
you’re a Catholic, this may be normal; otherwise, it’s a symptom)
 Uncharacteristic indecisiveness or diminished ability to think clearly or
concentrate on a given task (if you’re a little spacey all the time, this
doesn’t count as a symptom)
 Recurrent thoughts of death or suicide (assuming you aren’t a French
philosopher)
29
Chapter 2: Demystifying Bipolar Disorder

If you tally your score and find that you have five or more of these symptoms,
don’t jump to conclusions. You still may not be experiencing a major depres-
sive episode. Any of the following can disqualify the episode from achieving
major-depression status:
 Something terrible happened before you became depressed, such as the
death of a loved one, a divorce, or a job loss. In other words, you have
good reason to feel depressed.
 You’re dealing with substance abuse, such as heavy drinking.
 The depression is a component of a mixed episode.
Avoid the temptation to self-diagnose. However, if you’re experiencing the
symptoms of a major depressive or manic episode, or you feel abnormally
energetic and enlightened, we encourage you to consult a psychiatrist for a
more in-depth evaluation.
Manic episode
Mania is the flip side of depression — the wired side of tired. Imagine a pin-
ball machine on speed to get a pretty good idea of what mania is all about.
However, you don’t officially experience a manic episode unless the mania
lasts for at least one week or requires hospitalization. The episode also must
be characterized by an “abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or
irritable mood.” Three of the following symptoms must also be present during
the week; four if your mood is irritable rather than elevated or expansive:
 Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity
 Decreased need for sleep (feeling well-rested after three hours or less)
 Excessive talking or the need to continuously talk
 Racing thoughts with plenty of ideas
 Inability to concentrate and easily distracted by insignificant external
stimuli
 Significant increase in goal-directed activity or significant speeding up of
thoughts and physical movement (If you plan on remodeling the kitchen,
making a killing in the stock market, and buying a private island in the
Pacific, all by week’s end, you qualify.)
 Excessive involvement in risky, potentially self-destructive activities,
including sexual indiscretions, unrestrained shopping sprees, and
investments in pyramid schemes
To qualify as a bona-fide manic episode, the mania must be severe enough 
to mess up some aspect of your life, such as your interpersonal relation-
ships, your job, or your physical functioning. The mania also must not be
30
Part I: Boning Up on Bipolar Disorder 

substance-induced to qualify for diagnosis, because drugs like speed and
ecstasy keep most people up all night. However, if you’re still flying high long
after your friends’ weekend highs have subsided, the substances may have
triggered an episode that needs medical attention.
Hypomanic episode
Hypomania is a less-intense mania that doesn’t last as long as a full-blown
mania and that doesn’t cause significant problems with your interpersonal
relationships or job. Your mood must be elevated above your normal state
and display characteristics that others around you believe are slightly out of
character. The episode must last at least four days.
Mixed manic episode
To qualify as mixed mania, an episode must simultaneously meet the require-
ments stipulated for a major depressive episode and a manic episode. Your
symptoms must occur nearly every day for a week straight. When experienc-
ing a mixed manic episode, you commonly exhibit uncharacteristic emotional
storms. You may yell in the morning and cry in the evening or be boastful one
minute and self-deprecating the next. Or you may just experience a constant
feeling of agitation or irritability throughout the day.
Psychosis . . . sometimes
Perhaps the most frightening accompaniment to depression or mania is psy-
chosis — delusional thinking, paranoia, and visual or auditory hallucinations.
Although psychosis isn’t a necessary part of the bipolar diagnosis, it can
accompany a mood episode. The extremes of depression and, more often,
mania can traumatize the mind to such an extent that it begins to latch on to
self-destructive or grandiose beliefs, become obsessed with fears that have
no basis in reality, or perceive sights and sounds that are not present. During
a psychotic episode, you may
 Feel as though you have special powers
 Hear voices that other people can’t hear and believe they’re talking
about you or sometimes instructing you to perform certain acts
 Believe that people can read your mind or put thoughts into your head
 Think that the television or radio is sending you special messages
 Think that people are following you or trying to harm you when they’re not
 Believe that you can accomplish goals that are well beyond your abili-
ties and means
31
Chapter 2: Demystifying Bipolar Disorder

Although psychosis sounds dramatic and easily identifiable, it can be quite
subtle and shrouded by enough reality to make “psychosis” seem more like
“unusually perceptive.” Is your boss trying to fire you, or are you just para-
noid? Can you really portend future events, or are your accurate predictions
of critical world events just a coincidence?
Digging Up the Genetic Roots
Entire businesses are dedicated to mapping human chromosomes to identify
the genes that cause afflictions from Alzheimer’s to zits. Although scientists
can’t point the finger at a single gene that’s responsible for bipolar disorder,
indisputable evidence proves that the disorder is rooted deep in the gene
pool. Check out the following statistics:
 One percent of the general population has Bipolar I.
 Two to three percent of the general population likely has Bipolar II, and
an even larger percentage is thought to have Cyclothymic disorder.
 In families in which a member gets diagnosed with Bipolar I, immediate
family members (mom, dad, brother, or sister) have a 7 to 10 percent
higher risk of developing bipolar disorder than someone in the general
population.
 An identical twin has a 60 to 70 percent chance of having Bipolar I if the
other twin has it.
 A fraternal twin has a 10 to 15 percent chance of having Bipolar I if the
other twin has it. (This percentage is slightly higher than the risk for
other immediate family members.)
No single gene is the sole culprit that causes bipolar disorder. Intensive and
varied research studies have yielded unclear and mixed results, due to sev-
eral factors:
 Multiple genes appear to be involved in causing bipolar disorder, and
they overlap with genes suspected of causing other psychiatric disor-
ders, including unipolar depression and schizophrenia.
 If bipolar disorder were 100 percent genetic, 100 percent of identical
twins with bipolar disorder would have the disorder, which isn’t the
case. Studies must look for factors that “turn on” the bipolar genes.
 Multiple disorders (from different problems in different parts of the
brain) are likely to contribute to the symptoms doctors collectively refer
to as bipolar disorder. This means the genetic search is actually explor-
ing several disorders rather than just one. The people under the micro-
scope may have a range of bipolar subtypes, making the results
confusing and inconsistent.
32
Part I: Boning Up on Bipolar Disorder 

What are the odds?
Scientists used to believe that about 1 percent of the population suffered
from bipolar disorder. Now, this figure applies to the narrow definition of
Bipolar I. When you roll in the numbers for Bipolar II, Cyclothymic disorder,
and Bipolar NOS, the percentage soars to 5 percent or higher. And that’s just
for the general population. If your family is genetically loaded with bipolar
disorder, your odds of developing it or another psychiatric disorder climb
even higher:
 You have 10 percent odds if you have one parent with bipolar disorder.
 You have 20 percent odds or higher if both your parents have bipolar
disorder. (Some studies show that 50 percent of children with bipolar
parents may experience some form of cycling mood disorder.)
 You have increased risk for bipolar disorder, recurrent unipolar depres-
sion, or schizoaffective disorder if you have a first-degree relative, such
as an uncle or aunt, with bipolar disorder.
Studies consistently show that genetics makes up about 75 percent of the
cause of Bipolar I disorder. Environmental variation may play a larger role in
other bipolar subtypes, but this isn’t clear yet.
Shaking the family tree
An accurate diagnosis of your condition can benefit greatly from an examina-
tion of your family history, but you never know what’s going to fall when you
start shaking your family tree. If you ask your relatives whether anyone in the
family has ever been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, you may receive plenty
of blank stares and all too little useful information. Try asking this series of
more probing questions:
 Has anyone in the family had alcohol or substance abuse problems?
Many people with bipolar disorder self-medicate with alcohol and drugs.
 Have any family members been diagnosed with schizophrenia? In the
not-so-distant past, doctors commonly misdiagnosed bipolar disorder as
schizophrenia.
 Has any family member been treated for any mental illness? If a family
member has received treatment for depression, psychosis, or other
mental illnesses, he may not have received the correct diagnosis.
 Has anyone in the family had to “go away for a while” to an institu-
tion, sanatorium, or rehab center? Families often like to cover up mem-
ories of relatives who had to be hospitalized for mental illnesses by
saying that they had to “go away for a while.”
33
Chapter 2: Demystifying Bipolar Disorder

 Have any family members been known to be particularly energetic or
eccentric? In the past, people politely described relatives with various
degrees of mental illness as “eccentric.”
 Has anyone in the family suffered from physical symptoms such as
chronic exhaustion, pain, or digestive problems? These can be physi-
cal manifestations of the illness.
If you were adopted, consider tracking down your birth records and contact-
ing members of your biological family for medical information. This can help
with diagnosing any genetically related illnesses, including bipolar disorder,
heart disease, and cancer.
Families can be particularly secretive, especially when it comes to protecting
the reputation of the dead. They can become even more defensive if you con-
front them while you’re in the throes of mania. Explain how important an
accurate and detailed family history is for your diagnosis.
Predisposed, not predetermined
Being genetically predisposed to bipolar disorder doesn’t guarantee that
you’ll experience symptoms. Genetic predisposition only makes you suscepti-
ble to developing bipolar disorder. Think of it as a susceptibility to skin
cancer: If you’re born with pale skin, you may be susceptible to extreme sun-
burn and skin cancer, but if you prudently avoid overexposure to the sun,
you can prevent the cancer.
The same is true of bipolar disorder. You may have the susceptibility, but if
you live a stress-free existence and take care of yourself physically, you may
be able to live symptom free. You may also be one of the lucky few who have
the susceptibility but don’t experience the symptoms.
Scientists don’t know all the factors that can activate bipolar disorder. Stress
is well documented as a trigger, but other biological events, such as viruses,
may be involved. The severity of the underlying susceptibility is also impor-
tant. Some forms are more sensitive to stress than others.
Examining the Biochemistry 
of Bipolar Disorder
Many mental health professionals refer to bipolar disorder as a “chemical
imbalance,” which oversimplifies what’s actually going on. It implies that if
you could inject the proper mix of chemicals into your brain, you could
somehow cure bipolar disorder. Moreover, it creates the false impression that
medications are solely designed to replace chemicals that your brain lacks.
34
Part I: Boning Up on Bipolar Disorder 

Brain chemistry definitely has something to do with bipolar disorder. Your
body produces and uses countless chemicals, many of which affect the way
your mind and body function. However, your brain’s physiology — the way it
uses and processes the chemicals — has as much influence on bipolar disor-
der as the chemicals themselves.
Where in the brain does 
bipolar disorder form?
Pinpointing the location of bipolar disorder in your brain is almost as difficult
as finding affordable health insurance. Your brain consists of about 100 billion
cells of two different types: neurons and glial cells. Neurons form the telecom-
munications network in the brain, enabling the cells to communicate with
one another and carry signals back and forth between your brain and the
rest of your body. Glial cells act as the brain’s caretakers — ensuring that the
neurons have the chemicals and nutrients they need to function, repairing
damaged brain cells, and keeping infection at bay.
As shown in Figure 2-1, the brain is divided into the following four sections:
 Cerebrum: The part of the brain that most people consider to be the
brain, the part that you see in the science fiction movies. The cerebrum
is the uniquely human component in charge of gathering and processing
information, making connections, generating thought, and controlling
emotions and behavior. Problems in certain areas of the cerebrum, such
as the prefrontal cortex, are thought to play a role in the emotional over-
reactivity observed in bipolar disorder.
 Middle brain: A relay station for messages traveling from the cerebrum
to other parts of the brain. It includes the thalamus and hypothalamus.
This brain region attends to the day-to-day maintenance of the body as
well — sleeping, eating, temperature regulation, and reproduction —
earning it the nickname “feed and breed.” Many symptoms of bipolar
disorder stem from this system, including sleep variations, energy level
fluctuations, sexuality issues, and appetite loss/gain.
 Brain stem: A less developed part of the brain that regulates life-giving
functions, such as breathing. The brain stem is also responsible for the
“fight or flight” response, or the kick in the pants that your brain gives
you when it perceives a threat. Mania may be the result of too much
arousal, whereas depression is the result of too little. This brain region
plays at least a small role in bipolar disorder.
 Cerebellum: A little ball of neurons at the back of the brain that most
experts believe is involved in fine-tuning complex movements, along with
performing a host of other functions that remain undiscovered. No one
knows yet whether or not the cerebellum plays a role in bipolar disorder.
35
Chapter 2: Demystifying Bipolar Disorder

Within the cerebrum, the brain is further divided. The cerebral cortex is the
outermost layer of the brain, commonly referred to as the gray matter. Below
that layer are bundles of long nerve fibers called white matter that carry infor-
mation between parts of the brain. Deep in the brain are subcortical areas,
consisting of collections of neurons that regulate different functions. One
such area is the limbic system, including the amygdala, hippocampus, and cin-
gulate gyrus. These areas are involved in emotional control, drive and motiva-
tion, fear responses, and memory. Many brain function studies reveal that

these areas of the brain function differently in people with bipolar disorder or
depression compared to those without these illnesses.
The brain science behind bipolar disorder is just beginning to mature. The
concept of a simple chemical imbalance, although appealing, isn’t quite accu-
rate. Bipolar disorder more likely is the result of various blips in the brain cir-
cuitry that foul up the operations of various departments and scramble
communications between departments.
Although various areas of the brain are suspected conspirators in producing
bipolar symptoms, doctors can’t restructure the brain to repair the abnor-
malities. Instead, they choose the less intrusive option of adjusting the way
the brain transfers signals via its neurotransmitters.
What are neurotransmitters, anyway?
Neurons are elongated cells, shown in Figure 2-2, that carry signals through-
out your brain and body. The communication system within each neuron is
primarily electrical, enabling it to carry a signal at a high speed from start to
finish. A very small space, called the synapse, separates neighboring neurons
and prevents them from communicating directly via the electronic messaging
system. Instead, neurons communicate with one another by sending chemi-
cals, called neurotransmitters, across the synapse. One neuron sends the
signal by releasing neurotransmitters, which the other neuron receives via 
its receptor sites.

Chapter 2: Demystifying Bipolar Disorder

The five neurotransmitters considered most responsible for maintaining
mood are the following:
 Serotonin: An essential amino acid that has a calming effect on humans,
serotonin helps regulate mood, anxiety, fear, sleep, body temperature,
the rate at which your body releases certain hormones, and many other
body and brain processes.
 Dopamine: Generally considered the feel-good neurotransmitter,
dopamine is linked to feelings of pleasure. It modulates attention and
focus, as well as muscle movements, and is also related to psychosis.
 Norepinephrine: Best known for its role in your fight or flight response,
norepinephrine also functions to regulate mood, anxiety, and memory.
 Glutamate: The primary neurotransmitter in charge of revving up 
the central nervous system, glutamate may play a significant role in
causing mania.
 GABA: Short for gaba-amino butyric acid, GABA is an amino acid trans-
mitter that can cool down or excite brain cells, depending on other
chemicals surrounding it.
When the neuron receptor “reads” the neurotransmitter, it releases a cascade
of chemicals from inside it referred to as second messengers, including vari-
ous G-proteins and protein kinases. These second messengers are mediators
that help translate the chemical signals from the neurotransmitters into elec-
trical signals that travel through the neuron. Researchers believe these chem-
icals are showing a lot of promise as possible keys for understanding bipolar
disorder and ultimately developing more effective treatments.
Can you achieve better living 
through chemicals?
The medications doctors prescribe for bipolar disorder primarily alter the
way your brain’s neurons process the mood-regulating neurotransmitters in
your brain. Each medication has a different way of working, and each way is
called its mechanism of action. Mood medications generally function in one of
the following ways:
 Increase or decrease the actual amount of a particular neurotransmitter
in your system
 Restrict the neuron’s ability to receive a neurotransmitter
 Adjust the second-messenger system to slow inappropriate chemical
activity in the neuron
 Prevent electrical misfiring in the neurons
38
Part I: Boning Up on Bipolar Disorder 

Psychiatrists and physicians commonly prescribe the following medications
to treat mania or depression:
 Lithium: Little is known about lithium’s mechanism of action, but it
appears to regulate the second-messenger system, helping suppress
both mania and depression. Lithium may also reduce the effect of ele-
vated glutamate levels, potentially preventing mania.
 SSRI antidepressants: Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors are
designed to prevent serotonin from being vacuumed back into the first
neuron of a synapse, effectively increasing serotonin levels in the synapse.
Other antidepressants, such as SSNRIs (Selective Serotonin and
Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors), work on various combinations of
neurotransmitters to bring them to levels that help stabilize moods.
 Anticonvulsants: Valproate (Depakote), carbamazepine (Tegretol), and
other anticonvulsants appear to function on the second-messenger
system, particularly in systems involving glutamate and GABA.
Developed primarily to help treat epileptic seizures, these medications
have also proved effective as antimanic medications.
 Antipsychotics: Olanzapine (Zyprexa), clozapine (Clozaril), and other
antipsychotic (neuroleptic) agents are typically used to treat symptoms
of schizophrenia. They’ve also proved effective in treating acute manic
episodes. Antipsychotics appear to work by blocking receptors for
dopamine, although they can affect serotonin receptors as well.
Skip to Chapter 7 for details on the various medications used to treat bipolar
disorder.
Trudging Through Stressors, Triggers, 
and Other Nasty Stuff
Biochemistry tells only half the story of bipolar disorder. Environmental fac-
tors play a large role, particularly in the timing of the onset of the disorder.
Many people with bipolar disorder experience their first major mood episodes
during exceptionally stressful periods of their lives (during a major relation-
ship conflict, job loss, or the loss of a friend or relative, for example). A sus-
ceptibility to the illness coupled with an inordinate amount of stress often
triggers the symptoms and worsens the course of the disorder.
The brains of people with bipolar disorder are often less effective at manag-
ing stress, even between mood episodes. Developing strategies for handling
strong emotions and stress is central to the prevention and acute manage-
ment of mood episodes. Throughout this book, we describe various tech-
niques for reigning in mood episodes.
39
Chapter 2: Demystifying Bipolar Disorder

What really ticks you off?
Many psychologists and self-help gurus try to force-feed people the notion
that “Nobody can make you angry.” Sure, if you’re a groveling sycophant, that
may be true, but even Jesus got a little ticked off at times. Anger, in modulated
amounts, can be a healthy response to a disturbing situation. If you have con-
trol over your moods, it can spark you to take action in the following ways:
 Determine if your anger stems from a misunderstanding.
 Identify the reason you feel angry.
 Resolve any conflicts that may be causing the anger.
 Deal with internal conflicts that may be causing frustration.
 Choose to ignore any issues you can’t control.
Anger produces an adrenaline rush that can place enormous amounts of
stress on your psyche and emotions. The faster you can shed the anger, the
faster you eliminate a stressor that can trigger a mood episode.
A brain that angers too easily and calms too slowly commonly carries bipolar
disorder. If you can’t control your anger, make sure to let your doctor know,
because medication adjustments may allow you to have a more normal anger
experience.
Can something be too exciting?
Have you ever been involved in a relationship or a project that completely
engulfs your mind, body, and soul? You feel like you’re walking 3 feet above
the pavement. You stop watching the clock. Movement and thought are
effortless.
These moments in life can be most exhilarating, but if you have a susceptibil-
ity to bipolar disorder, they can also be dangerous. During these periods of
blissful obsession, you may believe you need less sleep. Perhaps you decide
to skip a meal or two and chug a little more caffeine to stay awake. Your
heightened sense can eventually become too high, last too long, and drive
you into a full-blown manic state, which leads to an inevitable crash.
Chapter 12 shows you how to map your moods and develop an early warning
system for identifying mood swings before they spin out of control. By acting
immediately, you can often short-circuit an episode of mania or depression.
40
Part I: Boning Up on Bipolar Disorder 

Sleep deprivation commonly triggers mania. Fight back by establishing a reg-
ular sleep routine and making sure that you obtain a sufficient amount of
sleep no matter what’s going on in your life. Copy the sleep log you find in
Chapter 12 to get started.
Some real downers
Sometimes the tree of life looks more like a lemon tree. You lose your job,
your kids revolt, your spouse runs off with the neighbor, and your basement
floods. To top it all off, your pastor, mom, or mentor gives you a sermon
telling you that if life gives you lemons, you should make lemonade.
If you can make lemonade, that’s great. Bad events often act as the kick in the
pants you need to solve a problem that’s dogging you. Maybe you need a new
job. Perhaps relationship issues need some attention. You may need to crack
down on the kids to do their chores. If you can trace your sadness back to an
identifiable problem, solving the problem can make the blues dissipate. Some-
times, such as when you’re grieving the loss of a loved one, you have to work
through a period of sadness. These down periods are expected and normal.
When your life is going along pretty well, however, and you really don’t have
anything to be unhappy about, but you still feel despondent, the sadness may
be depression, and it may deepen beyond your control. You may be experi-
encing a clinical depression that requires medication, therapy, or both.
Seasons change, and so do you
If left to our devices, few of us would remain stable. Humans need structure,
routine, and ceremony to order the chaos, make life meaningful, and give us
something to celebrate.
The most basic environmental factors that structure routines are the rising
and setting of the sun and the change in seasons. All human beings and most
animals tune into these environmental cues by using internal clocks. Each
individual establishes a unique circadian rhythm. In nature, people would gen-
erally rise and set with the sun. In modern society, however, you have more
control over your environment, and you can set your own internal clock.
Setting your own clock is swell. You can party all night, go to work in the
morning, and still have time for dinner with your family. However, if you
suffer from bipolar disorder, you may be more sensitive to changes in your
daily routine and to any blips in your sleep pattern.
41
Chapter 2: Demystifying Bipolar Disorder

Any major changes in routine, such as the following, can throw you off kilter:
 Vacation
 Holidays
 Return to work
 Return to school
 All-nighter
 Job change
 Jet lag
Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy, which we discuss in Chapter 8,
trains you to establish a healthy circadian rhythm and avoid veering from it.
Many people with bipolar disorder have found that this therapy, along with
medication, is a powerful combination in stabilizing their moods.
Unharmonic hormones
Although neurotransmitters garner all the attention in most discussions con-
cerning the biochemistry of bipolar disorder, hormones can have a dramatic
effect on moods as well. Women wrestle with hormones their entire lives. A
few lucky women seem immune to the mood-altering effects of hormones, but
the least lucky are bandied about like a bobber on the high seas. Men, too,
can suffer from hormonal imbalances; just watch the guys in the stands at
any major sporting event.
Women have the circadian rhythm from hell — hormone fluctuations that
follow a regular pattern through each and every month and over the course
of their lives. The ebb and flow of hormones seem to trigger the vacillations
of mood, especially when estrogen levels undergo a dramatic change, such as
a girl’s first period, after a woman gives birth, or during perimenopause — the
transition between reproductive years and menopause.
However, you can’t pin all the blame on raging hormones. Changes in hormone
levels may coincide with other events that have a greater impact on moods:
 During the teen years, girls’ lives explode with new social, emotional,
and behavioral demands.
 The birth of a child may increase the new mother’s workload and
decrease the amount of sleep she gets.
 During perimenopause, hot flashes and night sweats can disturb a
woman’s normal sleep pattern.
42
Part I: Boning Up on Bipolar Disorder 

 A woman’s role or perceived role in the family may change.
 A woman’s self-concept may change.
 Relationship issues can compound stress.
Although hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has shown some effectiveness
in treating mood symptoms, some studies show that the risks, including a
potential increase in risk for breast cancer, outweigh the benefits. Using HRT
is highly controversial. Before undertaking the therapy, discuss potential ben-
efits and risks with your doctor.
Overcoming the Power 
of Negative Thinking
Your mind can be its own worst enemy. Latching on to negative views and
allowing them free reign inside your mind can often worsen depression and
despair. You can talk yourself into being miserable. You can convince yourself
that you’re unwanted, that someone wants to harm you, or that certain
events will happen if you will them to. You can even think yourself into
having a real, physical illness.
Medication can help break the cycle of negative thinking, but therapy, espe-
cially cognitive therapy, has proven very effective in breaking the cycle and
relieving or preventing depression.
In cognitive therapy, your therapist helps you identify negative thoughts and
patterns, such as
 Unrealistic expectations: If you think that everything and everyone needs
to be perfect, that you’re entitled to everything you want, or that every-
one should be nice to you all the time, you may get depressed when real-
ity smacks you in the face. Cognitive therapy can help you come to terms
with reality and adjust your expectations to avoid disappointments.
 Automatic thoughts: If you assume that another person is thinking nega-
tive thoughts about you, that you’re a total failure, that everyone hates
you, or that nothing you do can improve your life, you may be setting up
some self-fulfilling prophecies. Cognitive therapy increases your sensi-
tivity to automatic thoughts and teaches you how to shut them down.
 Maladaptive assumptions: Forming negative theories about life or what
you should do can often lead to depression. Thinking that you need
everyone’s approval to feel loved, that you can’t succeed without the
43
Chapter 2: Demystifying Bipolar Disorder

help of another person, or that you’re stuck in a dead-end job are all
maladaptive assumptions. When you begin to recognize them and come
to realize that they’re true only insofar as you believe them, you can
shed them.
 Low self-esteem: Beating yourself up over your perceived shortcomings
can drive your self-esteem into the ground. Focusing on your unique tal-
ents and abilities raises your self-esteem and your mood.
Chapter 8 provides some exercises designed to help you harness the power
of positive thinking through cognitive therapy.
Recognizing All-Important Social Factors
Humans are social animals. When you don’t socialize to some degree, you
lose perspective, your mind turns in on itself, and life loses some of its color.
In the midst of a major depressive episode, however, the last thing you want
to do is party down with your homies. You may not even have the energy or
desire to drag yourself out of bed. But waiting for your mood to improve often
makes it worse. Fighting the urge to stay home, although tough, can be just
what you need to break the downward cycle of depression and turn your eyes
toward the light.
Establishing social contact delivers several benefits:
 Sunlight: Getting out increases your exposure to sunlight and fresh air,
which can have a positive effect on your mood.
 Perspective: You can see life and your reality through the eyes of others
and develop more objective views of reality.
 Rhythm: Having activities and something to look forward to can provide
you with healthy structure and a routine.
 Acceptance: Interacting with supportive friends and contacts can help
you feel more comfortable about your role in a community. You can also
find ways to help them, which helps you feel more useful and worthwhile.
In Chapter 8, we discuss interpersonal and social rhythm therapy, designed
to teach people how to become more socially involved and how to develop
healthy routines. Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy can also help you
shut down negative thinking and turn your focus to external stimulation.

A Positive Prognosis with 
a Proactive Plan
In This Chapter
 Gaining hope through a positive prognosis
 Attacking bipolar disorder before it attacks you
 Implementing effective prevention techniques
 Surviving an unavoidable hospital stay
 Identifying the warning signs of an impending mood episode
You can’t fight an affliction you can’t identify, so an accurate diagnosis is
the first step down the path to wellness. If you know your enemy, you
can draw up a proactive battle plan to defeat it or to at least keep it from
invading your personal space.
In this chapter, we reveal the positive prognosis that accompanies the bipo-
lar diagnosis. We show not only how you can conquer bouts of depression
and mania when they afflict you, but also how you can trip them up before
they establish their footing. We encourage you to remain as vigilant and unre-
lenting in stabilizing your moods as the disorder is in affecting your thoughts
and emotions. We hope to keep you ever mindful of your right to enjoy a full
and fulfilling life.
So, Doc, What’s the Prognosis?
The choice between a negative or positive prognosis is up to you, your
doctor, and your family and friends. If you accept the diagnosis, if you and
your doctor can discover an effective medicine or combination of medicines,
and if your family and friends pitch in to support you, the prognosis is very
positive indeed. On the other hand, if you try to ignore the problem, it will
likely get worse.

It’s true that a few lucky souls have only one major mood episode throughout
their lives. They experience deep depression or full-blown mania that eventu-
ally lifts, with or without treatment, and then they proceed to live out the
remainder of their lives symptom free. How often this happens, no one really
knows, but it does occasionally happen. In an overwhelming majority of cases,
however, when left untreated, when self-treated, or when treated with the
wrong medications, people with bipolar disorder can expect the following:
 Increase in frequency and severity of mood episodes
 Increased stress from the fallout of mood episodes
 Damaged relationships
 Loss of job or career status
 Increased financial problems
That’s the bad news.
The good news is that effective medicines and therapies are available, and
researchers are constantly developing newer and better treatments to add to
the arsenal. Through medication, therapy, and support, you can look forward
to achieving the following goals:
 Reduce or eliminate symptoms of mania and depression.
 Prevent the course of the illness from worsening.
 Reduce or eliminate stressors that trigger mania or depression.
 Find fulfilling and rewarding work.
 Repair damaged relationships and build new, healthy relationships.
 Restore your social and financial security.
Responding Proactively and Reactively
to Bipolar Disorder
Major mood episodes can sneak up on you with the silence of a brooding sad-
ness or the furtive stirrings of enthusiasm. Maybe you feel a little less tired
one day, a little more energetic. That’s normal. You have nothing to worry
about. After all, you have every right to enjoy your life, and you’re looking
forward to the weekend — TGIF! After work, you’ll head to Wilma’s Watering
Hole for an evening of rowdiness with your old college pals.
You get home a little late — actually, early Saturday morning — and you’re
not even tired. You lie in bed for two hours replaying the excitement of the
46
Part I: Boning Up on Bipolar Disorder 

evening on the insides of your eyelids. You finally manage to doze off, expect-
ing to sleep until noon, but you wake up bright and early and raring to go.
Why sleep when life’s smorgasbord summons you to its feast?
Requiring less sleep and more stimulation, you race through each day of the
week. By week’s end, pedal to the metal, you’re highballing down the hypo-
manic highway, and you don’t even know how you got there.
Now what?
Reacting: Extinguishing the flames
Enveloped by a full-blown mania or depression, you face limited choices. If
you pose no threat to yourself or others, you can choose to wait out the
storm and hope the raging currents subside. But if your behavior becomes
unbearable or dangerous — if you have suicidal thoughts or become increas-
ingly belligerent, for example — you or someone else on your behalf can seek
medical intervention in one or more of the following forms:
 Hospitalization: When you pose a threat to yourself or others or need
the safety and retreat that hospitalization provides
 Intensive outpatient therapy: Allows you to focus on getting well by day
and return home in the evening
 Medication: To lift the depression or quell the mania
 Therapy: To immediately address destructive thoughts or behaviors
Reacting can extinguish the flames, but it can also leave you and those
around you burned out. In your weakened state, you’re more susceptible to
flare-ups. And if your behavior during the episode hurt your loved ones, their
frustration or bitterness can compound the stress you already bear.
Proacting: Preventing flare-ups
If you tell the average person he has terminal cancer, he’s likely to curl up in
the fetal position and weep. Tell Lance Armstrong he has terminal cancer, and
he pedals to five consecutive victories in the Tour de France. How you respond
to your diagnosis and how ambitiously you pursue treatment and therapy
have a huge effect on the outcome. If you deny that you have a problem, lose
hope, or try to self-medicate with alcohol and other substances, the disorder
wins. If you discover the right medication, confront your hidden demons
through therapy, and remain vigilant, you prevail.

Practicing an Ounce of Prevention
Maintaining your car’s health with regular oil changes and the occasional
tune-up helps keep it running trouble free for thousands of miles. Maintaining
your physical health reduces the risk of cancer, heart disease, and other major
illnesses. Maintaining your mental health delivers similar benefits; yet, even
after being diagnosed with bipolar disorder, people often ignore medical orders
and continue to roll the dice in a game they’re almost certain to lose.
Don’t gamble with your mental health. After you’ve been diagnosed with bipolar
disorder, establish a preventive maintenance plan to ward off relapse and mini-
mize the damage of unavoidable mood episodes. Take the following actions:
 Accept your diagnosis.
 Take your medicine as prescribed.
 Monitor your moods for early warning signs, and consult your doctor at
the first sign of trouble.
 Identify and eliminate your stressors.
 Build a strong support network.

Shedding light on the kindling effect
Managing bipolar disorder proactively is impor-
tant not only in helping prevent mood episodes,
but also in thwarting what some doctors refer
to as the kindling effect — the worsening of the
disorder over time. The kindling effect is a
process that’s known to occur in the brains of
people with seizures. Seizures are electrical
storms in the brain, triggered by chemical
changes or other physical stresses on the brain
cells. With every storm, the brain can become
more and more sensitized. Eventually, the brain
can seize over and over again without any type
of trigger. The cells seem to “memorize” the
electrical storms and repeat them. Neurologists
aggressively focus on treating seizures to pre-
vent kindling, which progressively increases the
frequency and severity of seizures.
Seizures and mood disorders — particularly
bipolar disorder — are thought to have many
similarities, chemically and electrically. Some
experts suggest that the kindling effect can
occur in bipolar disorder — that each mood
episode is like a storm and that with each
episode the brain becomes more sensitized,
eventually having more frequent mood episodes
that require fewer emotional triggers. According
to the theory, early in the course of the illness, a
major stressor is required to trigger a mood
episode, but as more and more episodes occur,
the brain can develop mood episodes sponta-
neously instead of waiting for a trigger.
Doctors haven’t clearly identified the kindling
effect in bipolar disorder, and if it occurs, it’s
likely much more complex than what happens
with seizures. Perhaps some brains are more
vulnerable to kindling than others. Whether or
not the kindling model accurately pertains to
bipolar disorder, reducing the frequency of
mood episodes is beneficial for your health and
quality of life in many ways.

Accepting your bipolar badge
You don’t need a Harvard-educated psychiatrist to convince you that you’re
clinically depressed. For two weeks, you’ve been sad, tired, and achy, and
you’ve lost your mojo. Mania sometimes takes a little more convincing. You
feel better than ever, so what’s the problem? When you’re symptom free, you
also may be a little reluctant to admit that you have an illness. With bipolar
disorder, however, accepting the diagnosis is the first step toward recovery.
The path leading from denial to acceptance is a rocky road, but you can stick
to the following steps to take the bumps in stride:
1. Ask your psychiatrist to explain the reasons she arrived at your diag-
nosis and treatment plan.
Knowing the symptoms, background information, and other facts that
helped your psychiatrist arrive at your diagnosis is more likely to con-
vince you of its veracity. You deserve an explanation.
2. Get a second opinion, but don’t tell your second doctor what your
first doctor thinks.
Two concurring opinions weigh more than one. And if the two doctors
don’t concur, you may need to dig a little deeper by consulting another
doctor or doing a little research on your own. Accept your diagnosis
only after carefully and honestly assessing all the information from pro-
fessionals and feedback from loved ones.
3. Look back at what your life was like before the diagnosis.
Did low-level symptoms negatively affect your relationships, your plans,
and your happiness? Looking to the past may help you realize that your
life wasn’t a bowl of cherries before the diagnosis and that your life can
be much better with the proper treatment.
4. Ask your friends and family to provide honest feedback about your
moods and behaviors in the past.
When experiencing hypomania or mania, you may not objectively per-
ceive your behaviors, which can lead to denial.
5. Read stories of people who have bipolar disorder, especially those
who are on the road to recovery.
Patty Duke’s A Brilliant Madness: Living with Manic-Depressive Illness
(Bantam) and Kaye Jamison’s An Unquiet Mind: A Memoir of Moods and
Madness (Vintage) are excellent reads. Jane Pauley has also written a
biography that includes a description of her personal experience with
bipolar disorder called Skywriting: A Life Out of the Blue (Random
House). Reading about other people’s experiences with bipolar disorder
can often help you recognize parallels in your life.
49
Chapter 3: A Positive Prognosis with a Proactive Plan

6. Attend a bipolar disorder support group.
Having a forum where you can connect with others who face similar
struggles can help you bear your burdens and discover useful coping
strategies.
7. Realize the upside of bipolar disorder.
Many people go through their entire lives without experiencing the
extremes of mood and emotion that you’re capable of experiencing.
Kaye Jamison’s Touched with Fire: Manic Depression and the Artistic
Temperament (Free Press) can help you appreciate the positive aspects
of bipolar disorder.
Of course, working on acceptance assumes that you’re in a receptive and
rational state of mind. If you’re experiencing a mood episode that requires
immediate treatment, your doctor may treat your symptoms whether or not
you accept the diagnosis, for your own health and safety.
Utilizing your preventive medication
When you’re mired in the midst of a major mood episode, your doctor’s pri-
mary goal is to end the episode as quickly as possible, usually by prescribing
50
Part I: Boning Up on Bipolar Disorder 
The diagnostic dilemma
Bipolar disorder is actually a number of differ-
ent disorders — Bipolar I being the most clear-
cut and straightforward diagnosis. Bipolar II,
Cyclothymic disorder, and Bipolar NOS can be
trickier to sort out because the symptoms on the
manic end of the spectrum can be harder to
specify or notice. On the depressive side of the
coin, a whopping major depression can be fairly
easy to spot, but variations of it can be less vis-
ible. Furthermore, when the first episode of
major depression presents itself, you don’t
know if manic symptoms will develop down the
road; although family or personal history may
hold some clues, the information isn’t 100 per-
cent reliable.
Additionally, bipolar disorder is likely to occur
with other symptoms that can be misleading or
at least distracting in the diagnostic process.
Anxiety symptoms, psychosis, and substance
abuse are the most common overlapping disor-
ders in adults, with ADHD being a common
related disorder in kids.
You’re more likely to receive varying diagnostic
opinions if your diagnosis isn’t Bipolar I. When
you seek a second opinion, you should pay as
much attention to how the doctor arrived at the
diagnosis as you do to the diagnosis itself. What
symptoms has she considered? How has she
put them together with other information, such
as family history? What additional diagnoses
does she think are present? The answers you
receive paint a diagnostic portrait that helps you
understand what’s going on with your brain; this
picture provides you with something much more
valuable than a label and a prescription.

psychiatric medication. This process treats the acute phase of the illness. 
If you’re having manic symptoms, your doctor likely prescribes lithium or
another antimanic medication or increases the dose of the antimanic medica-
tion you’re taking. If you’re having a bout of depression, your doctor may pre-
scribe one or more antidepressants or increase the dose of the antidepressant
you’re currently taking. In either case, your doctor may prescribe a sedative
to help you sleep.
For times when you’re symptom free, your doctor likely prescribes a mainte-
nance dose of medication to function as a prophylaxis — a fancy word for
“preventive.” You may be tempted to forgo the prophylaxis when you feel fine
or when you feel hypomanic (better than fine). However, continuing to take
your medication is critical for the following reasons:
 Medication decreases your susceptibility to future mood episodes.
 Preventing mood fluctuations minimizes the risk of new episodes (see the
sidebar “Shedding light on the kindling effect” earlier in this chapter).
 Many medications require several days or weeks to build up to a thera-
peutic level in your system — the level at which they can effectively
maintain your mood. By taking your medications as prescribed, you
keep them at their therapeutic levels.
 Keeping medication levels stable prevents withdrawal symptoms, which
can trigger mood episodes.
 Retaining mood stability increases the effectiveness of therapy and
helps reduce interpersonal conflicts that may lead to stress.
51
Chapter 3: A Positive Prognosis with a Proactive Plan
Straying from your meds
Most people have trouble accepting any diag-
nosis that requires them to change the way they
live or increase the energy they must invest to
remain healthy. If you tell a guy who eats four
Mega Burgers a week that he needs to start
consuming more broccoli and spinach and
taking pills to control his high cholesterol, you’re
sure to meet some resistance. Even if he
accepts the diagnosis, orders leaner cuts of
meat, and increases his dietary intake of fruits
and vegetables, he’s likely to slip occasionally
and gorge on the full-fat menu items . . . with
extra mayo.
People, especially those who enjoy life, mea-
sure the quality of life not only in how they feel
and how long they live, but also in how much
they enjoy what life has to offer. The manic side
of bipolar disorder not only makes you feel
great, but also can make everything you experi-
ence more vivid and exciting. When treated
successfully, many people with bipolar disorder
stop taking their medications because they miss
their highs, and who can really blame them? But
you should recognize that this is a recipe for dis-
aster and a surefire way to make future
episodes harder to control.

Tracking and tweaking mood fluctuations
Human beings are animals programmed by nature to react instantly in
response to threats and changes in our environment. You flinch when some-
thing flies at your head. You blush when you feel embarrassed. Over the
course of any given day, your moods wax and wane. You can feel sad in the
morning, elated in the afternoon, and relieved by dinnertime.
Few people make conscious attempts to record their mood fluctuations, but
when you have bipolar disorder, tracking your moods can serve some impor-
tant functions:
 Reveal patterns to your mood fluctuations
 Uncover hidden causes, such as changes in medication or sleep regular-
ity, that may trigger mood episodes
 Provide early warning signs of impending mood episodes
 Give you something to do while you listen to another lecture on how
important it is to take your medications
With a completed mood chart in hand, you can begin to identify the possible
causes of your vacillating moods. Perhaps your depression always follows a
period of inactivity. Maybe you become hyper when you miss a meal. By iden-
tifying the patterns to your mood swings, you can take action to tweak your
moods and add a little stability.
Chapter 12 provides a basic mood chart you can copy and use to track your
ever-changing moods.
Pinpointing and removing stressors
Stress rarely occurs in a vacuum. Someone or something, commonly referred
to as a stressor, triggers it. You, the stressee, feel stress to the degree at which
genetics and your upbringing hard-wired you to feel it. So the obvious and
easiest way to avoid stress is to identify and avoid excessive or unnecessary
stressors. In Chapter 12, you find out how to avoid or minimize the most
common stressors, including the following:
 Conflicts at work
 Excessive work
 Lover quarrels
52
Part I: Boning Up on Bipolar Disorder 

 Parent–child conflicts
 Overcommitment
 Conflicts at home
 Holiday tension
 Uncomfortable situations
The demands of everyday life always include stressful events and interactions.
How you react and deal with the stress is the most important factor in how it
affects your mood disorder. People are wired differently for how they process
and manage the strong emotions that come with stress. Some have an easy-
going style that allows them to let things roll off their backs; other people are
easily inflamed by minor frustrations or irritations. People with bipolar disor-
der often struggle with “short fuses,” even between episodes. The people
around you also have a unique stress-response fingerprint, and sometimes
the differences in styles can magnify the emotional toll for everyone.
Your therapist can help you identify your unique temperament and develop
more effective emotional skills for managing stress. He can also help you and
those around you watch out for predictable conflicts that can stem from your
different response styles.
Stress has a bad rep, but it isn’t always harmful. Negative stress may fill you
with overwhelming anxiety and anger; spending too many hours at a job you
hate, for example, can make you angry and bitter. Positive events, such as
getting a new home or a better job, stir up your emotions and nervous
system just as much as negative ones, and your brain and body perceive
them as stressful, even if you’re happy. Anything that gets your adrenaline
going — good or bad — is a potential trigger for a mood episode.
Constructing a safety net
You may be the only person in your circle of family and friends with a bipolar
diagnosis, but the disorder affects everyone around you. The people you care
about have a stake in your recovery and can contribute significantly to the
success of your treatment. Your support group plays several important roles
in helping you achieve and maintain mood stability:
 Provide objective feedback concerning your moods and behavior
 Encourage you to follow your treatment plan
 Implement new, low-stress communication techniques
53
Chapter 3: A Positive Prognosis with a Proactive Plan

 Resolve conflicts to remove stressors
 Appreciate your unique abilities and contributions
 Obtain treatment for you when you can’t do so on your own
If you’ve ever witnessed a tightrope walker teetering high above a safety net,
you may not even notice the net. That’s how unobtrusive you want your safety
net to be. You should be confident that you have a solid safety net to catch
you if you tumble, but you should be able to live your life without constantly
being reminded of your disorder.
Enduring a Pound of Cure:
Hospitalization
Before the proliferation of effective psychiatric medications, a major mood
episode was likely to land you in the hospital for some voluntary or involun-
tary R & R. Nowadays, psychiatrists recommend shorter stays in the hospital
or in intensive outpatient treatment because hospital bills can be steep, and
your home or the home of a loving friend or family member may provide the
most conducive environment for recovery.
If you do need to be hospitalized for treatment, keep in mind that you’ve
been hospitalized for your own good and that you’ll be released as soon as
possible.
The following survival tips can make your stay in the hospital a little more
pleasant and productive:
 Bring any medications you’re currently taking or a list of the medica-
tions and prescribed doses.
 Bring your doctor’s and therapist’s phone numbers and other contact
information.
 Leave any valuables at home.
 Leave your belt, pocketknife, and any other potentially harmful acces-
sories at home. The hospital won’t let you have anything that you or
another patient can use to harm yourself or others.
 Bring slippers or loafers. The hospital probably won’t let you have
shoelaces.
 Bring comfortable but modest clothing — you won’t usually wear 
hospital pajamas.
54
Part I: Boning Up on Bipolar Disorder 

 If you can, bring your own pillow and a comfortable blanket. Hospital
linens are distinctly unsoothing.
 Contact your regular psychiatrist and therapist before or immediately
after you enter the hospital, and make sure that your inpatient team has
been in direct contact with your outpatient team to coordinate your
care. Your personal team members (family and friends) can help you
with this advocacy task if you aren’t up to it.
 Bring a journal without spirals or wires for your thoughts and feelings
and for any useful information you pick up from staff, groups, or other
patients.
 Cooperate with the staff, as much as your mental state allows.
 Get to know your fellow patients. Psychiatric hospitals are populated
with interesting and intelligent individuals who understand your experi-
ence better than people on the outside.
 If you smoke, bring an ample supply of cigarettes (if your hospital is non-
smoking, you may receive a nicotine patch).
 If you don’t smoke, bring a gas mask, because nearly everyone else in
the psych ward smokes.
 Bring books or magazines for quiet times and a deck of cards if you play
(you can usually get a game going).
 Pack one or two pictures of family, friends, or pets without glass frames.
Photos can warm up your space.
 Contact your regular psychiatrist and therapist before being released.
The hospital may not discharge you until you have follow-up appoint-
ments with your doctor and therapist in place.
Find out your visiting and phone privileges as soon as you can process the
information. You can then plan a schedule with your family and other sup-
port team members. Continued contact and support from the outside world
can be very beneficial, but avoid potentially dangerous or toxic interactions
as much as possible. Use phone and visiting time to build an outside support
network of healthy relationships and a firm foundation on which to build
your recovery.
A brief stay in the hospital may be just what you need to get back into bal-
ance. Avoiding conflicts with loved ones, the immediate alleviation of work
and chores, and the camaraderie of fellow psychiatric patients can provide a
much-needed change of scenery for some people.
Eventually, you must return to your “real” life. To smooth the transition from
the hospital back to your home, work with your doctor and support network
55
Chapter 3: A Positive Prognosis with a Proactive Plan

closely, especially if this is your first hospitalization. You and your family can
benefit greatly by knowing what to expect. Recovery can take several weeks.
If you, your family members, or your co-workers expect a quick return to
your normal level of functioning, the disappointment can lead to further con-
flict and stress.
Remaining Vigilant for Signs of Trouble
Bipolar disorder is like carry-on luggage: It disrupts your otherwise carefree
flight. You need to tote around your medications wherever you go, remember
to take them at the prescribed times, and refill your prescriptions before you
run out. You have more appointments to schedule and keep. And you must
constantly be on the lookout for any changes in the way you feel. You have to
avoid doing anything that can worsen your illness while remaining vigilant
not to be consumed by it.
Self-surveillance is no easy task, but the following tips can help you manage:
 Identify the symptoms that typically act as warning signs of an impend-
ing mood episode. For many people, the symptom may be a change in
the amount of sleep needed or desired. Others may notice changes in
their appetites, energy levels, thought or speech processes, external
appearance, or personal hygiene.
 Inform your support network of your typical early warning signs so they
can keep watch. You may not be able to notice them yourself.
 Keep a journal, and read it regularly. This can keep you in tune with the
ebb and flow of your moods and emotions.
 Chart your moods, as we discuss in Chapter 12.
During a major mood episode, especially a manic episode, people with bipo-
lar disorder frequently lose insight, or the ability to recognize their symp-
toms. This can actually be a brain-wiring problem — something very difficult
to change until the episode calms down. Gradually, as your episode settles
down, you can regain your perspective with the help of your personal and
medical support teams.

 Discounting health issues that mimic bipolar symptoms
 Examining your symptoms for clues
 Looking over your medical history
 Undergoing additional medical tests
 Moving beyond the medical evaluation
W
hen it comes to bipolar disorder, some doctors take an ill-advised
shortcut from symptom to prescription, skipping over the most
essential steps: examination and evaluation. You complain about feeling
depressed, and instead of searching for the root cause, the doctor hands you
a prescription for an antidepressant. When your depression is deep and
accompanied by thoughts of death or suicide, immediate treatment is often
the only safe option. In other cases, however, forgoing the necessary physical
examination and medical tests is both imprudent and irresponsible. The
shortcut prevents you from receiving a proper diagnosis and subjects you to
potentially useless and unnecessary medication.
Whether you see a physician or a psychiatrist about your problems with
depression or mania, the first step is to rule out any other medical conditions
that can possibly produce the same or similar symptoms.
In this chapter, we take you back to your physician for a proper physical
examination and a battery of medical tests. We introduce you to some of the
ailments that can commonly trigger or mimic mood imbalances. We help you
through the process of looking for possible causes of your mood and behav-
ioral symptoms. And we show you what to do next, assuming that you and
your physician rule out other medical issues.

Can It Be Something Else?
From the time of Aristotle to now, Western thought has endeavored to divide
and conquer, label and dissect. Western medicine is no different, holding firm
to the distinction between “physical ailments” and “brain disorders,” as if
people push their brains around in grocery carts.
The fact is that your brain is an integral part of your body, not only acting as
the puppet master, but also being subjected to imbalances and illnesses in
other organs and physiological systems. Your brain affects your body, and
your body affects your brain.
This chapter describes a systematic approach to ruling out other health
issues that may contribute to imbalances. Sometimes, however, bipolar disor-
der is the obvious diagnosis. If you’re experiencing a full-blown manic
episode and have a strong family history of psychiatric illness, your doctor
probably won’t waste time ruling out other possibilities.
Singing the body blues
Many physical ailments and conditions can cause changes in your brain 
function — changes that produce symptoms very similar to those of bipolar
disorder. Here’s a list of illnesses with symptoms that mimic those of mood
disorders or magnify symptoms of co-occurring mood disorders:
 Thyroid malfunction: Located at the base of your neck, your thyroid
gland produces hormones that regulate metabolism, growth, develop-
ment, and reproductive function. A malfunction can cause the thyroid
gland to overproduce hormones (hyperthyroidism), potentially causing
symptoms similar to mania, or underproduce hormones (hypothyroidism),
generating symptoms of depression.
 Hormone imbalances: Neurotransmitters are often at the mercy of hor-
mones, so when hormones fluctuate, moods commonly follow. During
puberty, during a woman’s menstrual cycle, and over the course of life,
hormone production rises and falls. Staying in tune with these changes
and seeking medical attention when necessary can help stabilize moods.
 Diabetes: The inability to process sugars and carbohydrates can result
in mood swings very similar to those characteristic of bipolar disorder.
Fortunately, most doctors screen regularly for diabetes.
 Mononucleosis: A viral infection that often afflicts high schoolers and
college students, mononucleosis, commonly called mono, can make you
feel extremely lethargic and depressed. A simple blood test can identify
the virus.
60
Part II: Taming the Bipolar Beast 

 Chronic fatigue syndrome: Also known as chronic fatigue immune defi-
ciency syndrome (CFIS), this condition can make you feel persistently
tired, achy, and irritable — very much like depression. Research sug-
gests that depression and chronic fatigue have overlapping changes in
brain chemistry, so even if he gives a chronic fatigue diagnosis, your
doctor may prescribe antidepressants.
 Lupus: An autoimmune disorder, lupus causes painful swelling of the
connective tissue and can inflame numerous organs, including the brain.
It’s typically accompanied by extreme fatigue and irritability. Your doctor
can perform a blood test to rule out lupus if he suspects you may have
it. Treatment typically calls for the use of corticosteroids, which can
induce mood swings.
 Cancer: A diagnosis of cancer can obviously trigger depression. Moreover,
some cancers and cancer treatments can produce mood instability.
 Cushing’s syndrome: Sometimes referred to as hypercortisolism,
Cushing’s syndrome results in a host of growth and development abnor-
malities and often mood instability. People with Cushing’s syndrome
commonly exhibit obesity in the torso, increased fat around the neck, a
rounded face, and thinning arms and legs.
 Hepatitis: Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver, typically caused by a
virus or a buildup of toxins. In addition to the characteristic yellowing of
the eyes, hepatitis can make you feel weak, tired, and nauseous and may
produce symptoms similar to those of depression. It can even cause hal-
lucinations if toxic levels of certain waste products accumulate in your
system. Manic symptoms are uncommon but possible.
 HIV/AIDS: Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome compromise the entire immune system, leaving
you vulnerable to many kinds of infections — some bothersome and
some deadly — that can affect mood. The HIV virus can also directly
attack the brain cells, creating problems with thinking and causing mood
changes. In addition, the daily stress of living with AIDS can burden you
with tremendous anxiety.
 Rheumatoid arthritis: Causing inflammation and degeneration of joint
tissue, rheumatoid arthritis can make you feel chronically weak, tired,
and achy, leading to persistent battles with depression. This and other
autoimmune disorders (such as lupus) can co-exist with depression and
may share underlying disease processes.
Any physical ailment that makes you feel miserable or interferes with your
ability to function properly can make you depressed. This is especially true
of chronic illnesses. You need to realize that feeling chronically miserable
isn’t normal. Ask your doctor for help.
Identifying a medical condition that can cause mood instability doesn’t rule
out the diagnosis of a mood disorder. You may have a medical condition and
a mood disorder, and both require treatment.

Chapter 4: Let’s Get Physical: Ruling Out Other Health Issues

Checking your medicine 
cabinet for culprits
Because bipolar disorder has so much to do with brain chemistry and physi-
ology, everything you consume, from cocaine to candy bars, can influence
your moods. As soon as you start chewing and swallowing any consumable,
your body begins breaking it down into chemical compounds and distribut-
ing the compounds to your heart, brain, muscles, organs, and appendages.
The list of medications and other substances that can affect your moods is
too long to mention, but here are a few of the big names that can cause seri-
ous problems:
 Alcohol
 Cocaine
 Amphetamines, which may be used to treat ADD or ADHD or other 
conditions
 Stimulants, such as those used in diet medications or to stay awake
(Vivarin or NoDoz, for example)
 Sleeping aids, including those containing valerian and melatonin
 Antihistamines in cold or allergy medications containing pseudo-
ephedrine, ephedra, or ephedrine
 Corticosteroids, used to treat many illnesses, including lupus, asthma,
and allergies
 Dextromethorphan, used in many cough suppressants
 Accutane, used to treat severe acne
If you’re taking any of these medications or substances, let your doctor know.
Stopping cold turkey isn’t always the best option. Your doctor can suggest
safe ways to wean you off the substances if he thinks they may be causing the
symptoms you’re experiencing.
Socially acceptable substances, including caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol, that
stimulate or depress brain activity can affect your moods. Avoid or reduce
your intake of these substances as much as possible.
Seeking Your Doctor’s Advice
Self-diagnosis can be fun or even addictive. You notice something about your-
self that seems out of the ordinary, fire up your Web browser, plug a few

descriptive words into a search engine, and proceed to convince yourself
that you have every ailment known to humanity:
“My torso’s pretty large, and I have these weird stretch marks . . . maybe I
have Cushing’s syndrome.”
“Auntie Mildred had to take something for her thyroid . . . maybe that’s
what I have.”
“Cancer! That’s it! I must have a brain tumor. I had a premonition that I’m
going to die.”
Like nature, the human mind abhors a vacuum, so it fills the space with any
idea or quack diagnosis that seems remotely possible. To set your mind at
ease and avoid making any mistakes that could possibly worsen your condi-
tion, visit your doctor.
Your doctor asks you a series of questions and gathers additional information
to form a history — the story of your condition — that guides her during the
physical examination and helps her decide which tests and further studies 
to order.
What are your symptoms?
The search for the cause of most illnesses begins with a careful examination of
the symptoms (how the illness presents itself) and the onset of the symptoms
(where, when, and with whom the disease presents itself). During a medical
examination, you essentially enlist the aid of your doctor to solve a mystery.
To ensure that your collaboration can successfully unravel the mystery, pro-
vide your doctor with a detailed list of your symptoms. You should be able to
supply your doctor with answers to the following questions:
 Do you feel depressed? Sad? Blue? Down? Empty? Numb?
 Do you feel inordinately energized or anxious?
 Do you feel angry or irritable more often than usual?
 Can you have fun or enjoy things?
 Have you had any problems getting to sleep or staying asleep?
 Have you been sleeping more than usual?
 Have you been eating significantly more or less than usual?
 Have you noticed behavior changes — doing significantly more or less
than usual?
 Have you had any serious conflicts at home or work?
 Have you been drinking or wanting to drink and party more than usual?
63
Chapter 4: Let’s Get Physical: Ruling Out Other Health Issues

Of course, the questions your doctor asks may not be as pointed as the ques-
tions we list here. When dealing with mood disorders, doctors often ask more
open-ended questions to find out how your life is going in general and to
observe how you react to various questions and issues that arise during 
the interview.
Your doctor also asks you about your other medical symptoms, focusing on
particular areas such as the nervous system. Through these questions, she
looks for clues that point to other possible conditions that could cause your
presenting symptoms. Her inquiry is called a review of systems. Here are some
possible questions:
 Have you experienced headaches, muscle aches, or weakness?
 Have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or changes in your 
bowel habits?
 Do you have joint pain or swelling?
 Have you noticed rashes or skin changes?
 Have you noticed any changes in appetite or weight?
 Are you thirsty all the time? Do you have to urinate frequently?
 Has your sex drive or ability to function sexually changed at all?
 Plenty of other questions!
At this point, you may have a question of your own: “What do all these ques-
tions have to do with my moods?” Although these questions may seem unre-
lated to your chief complaint, the answers and information you provide help
guide the doctor while she performs a targeted physical examination and
chooses the lab tests or other studies she may want to order.
When did your problem start?
When you’re looking for your car keys, the last question you want someone
to ask you is “When did you have them last?” If you knew that, you wouldn’t
have asked the person for help. But that’s basically what your doctor asks
you, and it may come across sounding like some sick joke:
Patient: “Doc, I think I’ve lost my mind!”
Doctor: “When did you have it last?”
Of course, your doctor would never say such a thing, but that’s pretty much
what she will attempt to do: trace your symptoms back to an identifiable
starting point and evaluate what set your mood episode(s) in motion.
64
Part II: Taming the Bipolar Beast 

Because your doctor doesn’t sit on your shoulder observing your daily activ-
ity, you need to come up with one or two answers or at least provide her with
some likely possibilities. Do your homework, and try to pinpoint events or
times of change in your life that correspond to the onset of your symptoms.
Here are some events or changes that may help jar your memory:
 Medication change
 Illness
 Accident, such as an auto accident or a fall
 Loss of a loved one
 Job loss or conflict
 Final exams
 Broken relationship
 Change in family structure, such as a child leaving or returning home
 Change in menstrual cycle
Mood disorders can build up over many years, so you may not be able to
point your finger at one particular incident or variation in your life that
started the ball rolling, but it’s worth a try.
The event or change that triggers an illness or begins to make it significantly
worse is rarely the entire cause of the illness. Maybe you took a medication
that torpedoed your libido, which eventually wore away at your relationship,
leaving you more depressed, which led to substance abuse and insomnia,
which led to a manic episode. If you catch the initial cause early enough to
stop the avalanche, great. If not, you may have a long chain of causes and
effects you need to treat.
What makes your symptoms 
better or worse?
Your symptoms have crept up on you, and you and your doctor can’t pinpoint
the cause. Frustrating? Yes. Hopeless? No. Time to undertake a new approach.
Instead of trying to identify causes, examine and test the most troublesome
and annoying symptoms to see if anything improves them or makes them
worse. To zero in on possible symptom amplifiers and reducers, answer the
following questions:
 Do you feel better or worse at any specific time of day? In the morning?
After lunch? After work? Before bed? Maybe you feel great at work but
depressed at home.
 Are you symptom free during any seasons? Spring? Summer? Fall? Winter?
65
Chapter 4: Let’s Get Physical: Ruling Out Other Health Issues

 Do your symptoms worsen near certain holidays or anniversaries, par-
ticularly anniversaries of losses or other traumatic events?
 Do you feel better or worse after eating specific foods or drinking partic-
ular beverages?
 Do any medications you currently take make you feel better or worse?
 Do any activities make you feel better or worse?
 Do any substances, such as caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, or sugar, alleviate
symptoms or make them worse? (No, we’re not recommending that you
try these substances to see if they work.)
What else can you tell the doc?
Beyond a list of your symptoms, your recollections of when the symptoms
first appeared, and what makes them better or worse, your doctor gathers
the following information:
 Your medical history, to determine if any past conditions are causing
your current symptoms.
 A list of medications you’re taking, to determine if any of them are
related to your symptoms. (Refer to the section “Checking your medi-
cine cabinet for culprits,” earlier in this chapter, for a list of the most
common problematic substances.)
 Your family history, to identify illnesses that may be genetic.
Finally! Your physical exam
After piecing together a history of your condition, your doctor typically per-
forms a brief physical examination to test your reflexes, check for enlarged
glands, and observe your overall physical health and your temperament and
behavior. And, as always, the nurse takes your temperature (to check for pos-
sible infection) and your blood pressure. Depending on the answers and
information you provide as part of your history, the doctor may examine cer-
tain parts of you (for example, your joints if you report joint pain) more thor-
oughly than usual.
On the off chance that your family physician immediately spots the condition
that’s causing your current mood misery, he diagnoses it, recommends one or
more treatment options, bills you, and heads out to the golf course. However,
if nothing shows up, you can look forward to some additional medical tests,
which we describe in the following section.
66
Part II: Taming the Bipolar Beast 

Digging Deeper with Additional 
Tests and Procedures
Depending on what your doctor digs up when taking your history and per-
forming the physical exam, she may order additional tests or procedures.
Some tests, such as those that examine blood-sugar levels, are fairly routine.
Others, such as tests for thyroid hormone levels, are specifically targeted at
finding clues to mood abnormalities.
The following sections describe some of the more common lab tests that
your doctor may order and what the results of these tests may reveal.
Standard lab tests
Standard lab tests, including tests for your blood-sugar level and MRIs of your
brain and other suspect areas of your anatomy, can often uncover hidden ill-
nesses that may be related to your mood maladies. If your doctor hasn’t yet
discovered the probable cause, she’s likely to order one or more of the follow-
ing tests:
 Blood tests to check your blood counts (red blood cell count for anemia
or white blood cell count for infections); glucose and lipid/cholesterol
levels; “chemistries,” to screen liver, kidney, and other organ function;
and sometimes folic acid or other vitamin levels
 Urinalysis to test for possible pregnancy, kidney problems, drug abuse
(particularly in adolescents), diabetes, and other conditions
 MRI or CAT scan to check for structural abnormalities in the brain or
other areas that could possibly cause the symptoms you’re experiencing
 EKG (sometimes called an ECG) to ensure that the old ticker is still
pumping well enough
 EEG if your doctor suspects that you may have a seizure disorder
 Spinal tap if you have an accompanying fever and your doctor suspects
an infection of the brain, such as spinal meningitis or encephalitis
Absent from the tests we list is any kind of blood test or scan for bipolar dis-
order. A common misconception is that your doctor can test you for bipolar
disorder. It seems reasonable enough: If bipolar disorder is a chemical imbal-
ance, why can’t you just measure the chemicals to see if they’re normal or
abnormal? As we explain in other chapters, including Chapter 3, the chemical
imbalance is a complex set of neurological abnormalities that are hard to pin
down. Eventually, scientists will establish tests of some kind, but the medical
field isn’t up to speed yet.
67
Chapter 4: Let’s Get Physical: Ruling Out Other Health Issues

Thyroid tests
The thyroid gland has a tremendous influence on moods and on the effective-
ness of medications used to treat mood disorders, including mania and
depression. It produces hormones that regulate your body’s energy use, and
low levels of thyroid hormones (hypothyroidism) lead to sluggishness,
weight gain, and depression; excessively high levels (hyperthyroidism) can
have you bouncing off the walls.
Early in the diagnostic stage, your physician or psychiatrist should order thy-
roid tests to check your level of thyroid hormones to determine if your thy-
roid gland is functioning properly. During the course of your treatment, your
doctor may want to run the tests again, especially if you take medication that
can affect thyroid function (such as lithium). A thyroid test is a blood test
that checks the levels of the following hormones:
 T4/Free T4 is the prime suspect in hyperthyroidism and hypothy-
roidism. Your doctor typically looks first at the T4 level to evaluate thy-
roid function.
 T3 is a thyroid hormone that may affect mood stability. Most doctors
focus on the T4 level, but if your T4 level is normal, your doctor may
examine your T3 level to determine if it’s causing problems.
 The pituitary gland secretes TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) to stim-
ulate thyroid activity. If TSH levels are too high or low, the pituitary
gland may cause the thyroid gland to produce excessive or insufficient
amounts of hormones. A TSH test is the most common screening test for
thyroid function.
If your thyroid hormones are out of whack, your doctor may also order a thy-
roid scan, which is basically an X-ray of your thyroid gland that indicates how
well it’s functioning. Before the test, you down a drink or pop a couple pills
laced with radioactive iodine. You lie on a scanner that takes a picture of
your glowing thyroid, and your doctor examines the picture. Your doctor
may refer you to an endocrinologist for this type of test and further workup of
your thyroid.
Other hormone tests
Surges of reproductive hormones can make you feel pumped full of superhu-
man strength or rocket your libido to the stratosphere. Just imagine what
they can do when they rock and roll to wild highs and lows during puberty
and pregnancy.
68
Part II: Taming the Bipolar Beast 

Even so, doctors don’t routinely run tests to check levels of estrogen, proges-
terone, testosterone, androgens, or other hormones that may be related to
moods. These types of hormones modulate brain development and function
throughout life, but their effects are indirect. Normal growth and a changing
range of hormone levels tell the doctor little about mood disorders. Some
tumors and medical conditions can cause huge changes in your hormone
levels, but additional medical symptoms would help identify these problems.
If your doctor suspects that wildly fluctuating reproductive hormones are
contributing to your mood symptoms, she may recommend further testing or
refer you to a specialist. Or she may consider starting you on hormone
replacement therapy (HRT).
During the ’80s and ’90s, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) was all the
rage. Now doctors call it menopausal hormone therapy (MHT), and they’ve
become a little more hesitant to recommend it. Some studies show that MHT
leads to increased risk of breast cancer and other cancers in women.
Although the jury is still out on whether the potential benefits outweigh the
possible risks, doctors generally play it safe. (For more information on the
benefits and risks of MHT, visit www.breastcancer.org.)
Although the word “hormones” usually makes people think “sex,” many hor-
mone systems keep the entire body running smoothly. Thyroid hormones are
the best known, but many others chip in to help. Insulin, which is related to
diabetes, is a hormone. Cortisol, a hormone from the adrenal gland, modu-
lates energy and wakefulness, fat metabolism, and many other body
processes. A cortisol surplus causes Cushing’s syndrome, which can be
related to mood symptoms. Your doctor examines these and other hormonal
systems more closely if blood test results or symptoms point the doctor in
their direction.
69
Chapter 4: Let’s Get Physical: Ruling Out Other Health Issues
Stumbling upon a treatment
Patients and doctors often discover cures and
effective treatments unexpectedly by observing
positive and negative side effects. Recently,
doctors discovered that an antiestrogen drug
called Tamoxifen, commonly used to treat
breast cancer in women, may also be effective
in treating acute mania.
In addition to blocking estrogen receptors in
breast cancer cells, scientists discovered that
Tamoxifen inhibits protein kinase C, which is
part of the second messenger system in neu-
rons. As a protein kinase C inhibitor, Tamoxifen
buffers the firing of the neurons. As of press
time, scientists were planning more formal stud-
ies to prove its effectiveness.
By tuning in to your symptoms and observing
what alleviates them or worsens them, you may
stumble upon the next medical breakthrough!

You Have a Clean Bill of Health. 
Now What?
Your doctor whacked you on the knee with his rubber mallet, extracted a few
ounces of blood, and grilled you on your past health and private indiscre-
tions. He poked and prodded you, but you still don’t have an explanation for
what’s wrong with you.
Now what?
You have a few choices:
 Get a second opinion from another physician. Another physician or
specialist, such as a neurologist or gynecologist, may be able to find
other potential causes.
 Let your physician treat your symptoms. Physicians can prescribe
mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and other psychotropic medications.
 Consult a psychiatrist. After your physician rules out medical issues,
you can turn your focus toward psychiatric illnesses, which a psychia-
trist is usually more qualified to sort out and treat. As we explain in
Chapter 5, a psychiatrist can work through a differential diagnosis to
identify or eliminate other psychiatric illnesses that contribute to creat-
ing your symptom profile.
Even if you don’t receive a clean bill of health — say, your physician identi-
fies and treats a medical condition that may be related to the depression or
mania — you may still need psychiatric treatment or therapy anyway. The
medical condition may play only a partial role in your mood instability, or 
it may play no role at all.

Getting a Psychiatric Evaluation
and Treatment Plan
In This Chapter
 Tracking down a qualified psychiatrist
 Preparing for your first meeting
 Sailing through your psychiatric evaluation and diagnosis
 Obtaining a treatment plan that works for you
T
he bipolar tempest not only rocks your boat, but also washes the captain
overboard. Your rational mind flails in the waves, and nobody on deck
has the wherewithal to throw it a lifesaver. You need someone on the outside
to intervene. You need a psychiatrist.
A qualified psychiatrist can help you reset your rudder and steer your ship
through the surrounding turbulence. She can explain what happened during
your most recent mood episode, provide an objective evaluation of your psy-
chiatric condition, offer one or more possible diagnoses, and develop a per-
sonalized treatment plan for you. Your evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment
plan chart the course for your recovery, and your psychiatrist’s continued
guidance helps you stay the course for years to come.
Because your psychiatrist plays such a key role in your evaluation, recovery,
and continued stability, this chapter offers advice on finding a qualified psy-
chiatrist who makes you feel comfortable and confident. We show you what
you can do to help your psychiatrist develop an accurate assessment of your
current condition and psychiatric needs. We also provide a list of items you
should bring to your first appointment and a few ideas on how to keep your
relationship with your psychiatrist in good working order so you don’t rock
the boat.

Finding Professional Help
Most people are happy to tell you all about their favorite doctors or healers;
they eagerly share the names of their bone doctors, lung doctors, or gynecol-
ogists. But if you ask someone for the name of a good psychiatrist, you can
feel the temperature of the room drop. Unlike plastic surgeons, psychiatrists
don’t advertise on billboards: “Depression Lift. Mood Augmentation. Payment
Plans Available!” You can flip through the phone book, but don’t expect it to
steer you in the direction of a bipolar specialist; all psychiatrists are pretty
much lumped together.
Is finding a qualified psychiatrist a hit-or-miss proposition? Not exactly. You
just need to do a little homework, remain persistent, and be willing to test-
drive a few models until you find the one that’s right for you. In this section,
you find suggestions on where to start your search.
After you identify a psychiatrist, your journey is just beginning. The evaluation
process takes time, and your treatments may require lengthy adjustment peri-
ods. If you’re in a crisis, your doctor is likely to treat you more aggressively,
possibly admitting you to a hospital. But even in a hospital, the process of
being worked up (having a doctor piece together your history, his observa-
tions, and test results to arrive at a diagnosis) and developing a treatment
plan can be achingly slow.
Ask your family doctor
When you stump your doctor with an illness, he has a list of specialists to
whom he can refer you. “Weird heart murmur? See Dr. Pulmonic, the cardiolo-
gist.” “Skin discoloration? Here’s a referral to Dr. Rasho, the dermatologist.”
The same is true of psychiatrists. Your family doctor, or internist, probably
knows at least one psychiatrist in his circle of colleagues whom he can rec-
ommend — a psychiatrist your doctor has worked with in the past who has a
successful track record. When you report mood-related symptoms that your
doctor can’t trace to a medical cause, he may recommend that you see a psy-
chiatrist. When he does, ask for names.
If you’re a woman, and your gynecologist fills the role as your primary care
physician (a common arrangement), ask her for a psychiatric referral. The two
fields often team up on diagnoses such as PMS and postpartum depression.
She can give you some names of psychiatrists with whom she likes to work.
Call your insurance company
Insurance companies have contracts with certain doctors whom they refer 
to as “preferred providers.” These doctors have agreed to the insurance 
72
Part II: Taming the Bipolar Beast 

company’s rates, making you responsible only for your co-pay. If you go to 
a doctor who’s not on this list, you may have to pay the full fee, so finding a
psychiatrist “in network” makes sense for financial reasons and because the
psychiatrist probably works with other doctors and hospitals in your network.
When looking at a preferred-provider list from your insurance company, you
can ask for more information about the doctors. You can ask whether a
doctor is board certified; request information about his level of experience;
and check on any areas of subspecialty, such as doctors who deal with mood
disorders. If you can’t find a doctor qualified to care for your type of illness,
you can appeal to your insurance company to cover a doctor outside the
plan so you can get appropriate care without paying extra.
Pick your therapist’s brain
Treatment need not begin with your family doctor or psychiatrist. You may
already be working with a therapist, likely a psychologist or social worker, for
when your moods hit a critical point. If you’re currently seeing a therapist
you like, ask her for a referral. She should be familiar with psychiatrists in
your area, possibly within the same office, and she should know which
people she works with most effectively.
Successful treatment almost always demands a consistent, coordinated 
combination of medicine and therapy, so you want a treatment duo who 
work well as a team. If your therapist and psychiatrist graduated from 
different schools of thought, they may be unwilling and unable to provide 
the integrated treatment that you deserve. By obtaining a referral from 
your therapist, you increase your odds of building a treatment team with a
unified vision.
If your therapist and psychiatrist work out of the same office, the proximity
often enhances communication. They can share notes and records without
the extra work; added costs; and delays inherent in phones, shipping, and fax
machines.
Go online
The Internet brings power and information, but it can also bring misinforma-
tion and fraud. When searching online for names of psychiatrists, use estab-
lished, professional Web sites provided by a local medical society or a
specialty society, including the following:
 American Psychiatric Association (www.psych.org)
 Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance (www.dbsalliance.org)
 National Institute of Mental Health (www.nimh.nih.gov)
73
Chapter 5: Getting a Psychiatric Evaluation and Treatment Plan

The DBSA site, which is consumer driven, provides a list of recommended
professionals (by people being treated for bipolar disorder) and is packed
with useful information for people suffering from depression and mania.
University, hospital, and medical school sites also have physician search
tools, and they usually list each doctor’s subspecialty. By checking subspe-
cialties, you may be able to find someone who’s studying bipolar disorder in
her research.
If you search more broadly and find other sites about mood disorders and
doctors, be sure to get additional references about the doctor or clinic before
you make an appointment. The Internet has its share of misinformation. If
you’re unsure whether a doctor who looks good to you is legitimate, double-
check the doctor’s licensing and complaint history with your local medical
society, which you can do for any doctor you consider seeing.
Consult your support group
As your symptoms develop, you may seek help from a support group — a
therapy or self-help group, a 12-step program, or an advocacy group. Maybe a
loved one, a judge, or a therapist recommends or demands that you attend
anger management or parenting groups. These settings are gold mines of
information about local doctors. Seasoned veterans freely vent about doctors
they adore and those they despise. Ask around and expect an earful!
Don’t limit your search to official support groups. Consult your personal sup-
port group as well — your brain trust — the people who provide daily guid-
ance and care and who know you most intimately. If they have any connec-
tions with psychiatrists, they can make recommendations with your tempera-
ment and needs in mind.
What to Look for in a Psychiatrist
When you’re shopping for a psychiatrist, you may begin to wonder who’s
doing the shopping. Everyone is grilling you with questions. When do you get
to ask questions and obtain the information you need to make an educated
choice? The answer to that question is “The sooner, the better.”
Chapter 19 provides a list of 10 questions to ask a psychiatrist or therapist.
Before your first visit, review those questions, and prepare yourself. If you’re
not the assertive type, ask a friend or relative who’s a little pushier to join
you. Bringing along a trusted ally, especially for the first visit, can make all
the difference in getting the information you need and walking away with a
74
Part II: Taming the Bipolar Beast 

good sense of how this doctor may work for you. Your support person can
also provide valuable information to the doctor — details you may forget or
consider too insignificant to mention.
When scouting for a psychiatrist, use the following criteria to guide your
selection:
 Experience: Experience in treating mood disorders usually ensures a
more accurate diagnosis and the most effective and current treatments.
Be sure to ask the psychiatrist how much experience she has had in
treating bipolar disorder.
 Sensitivity: Your psychiatrist should be a team player who accepts your
input and adjusts your treatments accordingly.
 Willingness to communicate: Your psychiatrist should not only 
prescribe medications, but also explain their purposes and possible 
side effects.
 Availability: Your psychiatrist may need to adjust your diagnosis and
medications frequently, especially in the early stages of treatment.
 Affordability: Is this doctor included in your insurance plan? Do the
charges for office visits fit in your budget? Does the doctor offer a pay-
ment plan?
Your doctor should be board certified in psychiatry. This means that she has
passed a rigorous set of exams, indicating her mastery of the specialty of psy-
chiatry. The American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology is one of many spe-
cialty boards that certify doctors as competent within a specialty. Doctors
can have licenses to practice medicine, but they may not be board certified
in a specialty. Doctors without board certification may have the required
skills, but the designation makes it much easier for you to verify their creden-
tials. Dating back to the mid-1990s, psychiatrists must retest for their board
certifications every 10 years to ensure that they keep up with all the rapid
changes in the field.
What to Bring to Your First Meeting
If you’ve never been to a psychiatrist, your imagination may cook up a vision,
using ingredients from old movies: you lying on a couch and relating stories
from your childhood to an old man who sits in a chair beside you and jots
down notes while he strokes his beard.
Reality paints a different portrait: you sitting on a comfortable chair or
couch, describing your symptoms to a professional man or woman who sits
in a chair across from you or behind a desk and peppers you with questions
about your current behaviors and feelings while jotting down notes.
75
Chapter 5: Getting a Psychiatric Evaluation and Treatment Plan

During your first meeting, your psychiatrist tries to write your story in med-
ical terms that accurately describe an illness such as bipolar disorder. She
needs a great deal of information about you, so she must ask a string of per-
sonal questions. She can’t get inside your head to see what you think and
feel, so she relies on the following information to guide her diagnosis:
 Objective information: Your psychiatrist’s observations of your appear-
ance and reactions to the interview, along with your report of recent
behaviors.
 Subjective information: The information and details you provide about
how you feel and what you’re thinking.
Your best shot at receiving an accurate diagnosis depends on your honesty
and openness and on your ability to clearly describe your thoughts and feel-
ings. If you withhold important information because you’re embarrassed or
for any other reason, you can’t expect your psychiatrist to paint an accurate
diagnostic portrait.
To prepare for your evaluation, you should collect the information we
describe in this section, either in your head or on paper, and get ready to
share the intimate details.
76
Part II: Taming the Bipolar Beast 
Can’t you just test me?
Unfortunately, the technology to test for bipolar
disorder doesn’t yet exist, for several reasons:
Bipolar disorder is probably a collection of dif-
ferent conditions; the brain changes are at
microscopic levels that scans have a hard time
detecting; and blood chemistry doesn’t accu-
rately depict brain chemistry. The future holds
out hope in the form of some new and improved
detection tools. Some innovations currently
brewing include the following:
 A functional MRI scan looks at changes in
brain chemistry — how active certain parts
of your brain are. This technology may
someday be able to detect consistent dif-
ferences between brains with bipolar dis-
order and those without.
 Genetic testing looks for certain genes asso-
ciated with the brain-chemistry changes
present in bipolar disorder. Particular pro-
teins and patterns of proteins and enzymes
may form the fingerprint of bipolar disorder,
and detecting the genes that regulate these
proteins could eventually help in identifying
the disorder.
 Neuropsychological tests (paper-and-
pencil testing) may help map patterns of
attention, memory, and information pro-
cessing (executive function) that appear to
be associated with bipolar disorder. These
tests may eventually aid in the early identi-
fication of bipolar disorder in children with
attention and behavioral problems.

Why you (or others) think you need help
The first thing your doctor wants to know is your chief complaint: What’s going
on that prompted you to seek a psychiatric evaluation? This is a story that
starts at the end and then goes back to fill in the details. Perhaps you’ve been
bedridden for days, raging for weeks, watching your mood swings chip away
at your marriage, spending extravagantly, feeling completely overwhelmed by
everything on your to-do list, or getting into arguments with friends and rela-
tives. If someone recommended that you see a psychiatrist or therapist,
explain why that person thinks you need help.
More information, please!
Your chief complaint simply states the problem. After you establish the prob-
lem, your psychiatrist can start collecting details about your emotional life
and your behavior patterns over the years. She may refer to these details as
the history of present illness or review of systems (organ systems and brain
systems). Through this systematic information-gathering approach, your psy-
chiatrist attempts to understand the pattern of psychiatric symptoms that
play a role in your condition. To gather a list of symptoms, your psychiatrist
is likely to ask many of the following questions:
 Depression-related questions: How sad do you get and for how long? Do
you feel hopeless or helpless? Do you think about death and dying? 
Do you think about killing yourself? Have you ever tried to kill yourself?
Do you enjoy things anymore? Can you concentrate? Are you tired all
the time?
 Mania-related questions: How happy or angry do you get and for how
long? Do you have periods of high energy and productivity? Have you
gotten into trouble during those times by spending money, having an
affair, or “borrowing” money from your employer? Do you have times
when you feel like you’re the best at everything?
 General questions on your thought processes: How’s your thinking? Do
your thoughts feel slow or hyperactive? Do you feel as though you can’t
think clearly? Does your brain play tricks on you — hearing voices, believ-
ing you have magical powers, or thinking people want to harm you?
 Questions about anxieties and compulsive behaviors: How much do
you worry about things? Have you ever had a panic attack? Do you have
unwanted thoughts that don’t go away or illogical behaviors you can’t
stop doing? Do you freeze in social situations or avoid them altogether?
77
Chapter 5: Getting a Psychiatric Evaluation and Treatment Plan

 Mental health history questions: What’s your psychiatric history? Have
you ever been hospitalized? Have you ever been on medications? Have
you seen a therapist at some time in your life?
 Questions about your life in the past: What was your childhood like?
How did you do in school? How did you relate to other kids? Did you
have close friends? Did you experience any depression or manic symp-
toms as a teenager or child?
 Questions about your life now: What’s your life like now? Do you work?
How’s work going? How’s your marriage/love life? How’s sex going for
you? How are things with your kids, your parents, or your siblings? Do
you have hobbies? Do you exercise?
As you can tell from these questions, the best way to respond is with a sig-
nificant other who can offer some details that you may not remember or see
in yourself. If your significant other or another family member is willing, and
you’re comfortable with the person’s being in the office with you, the two of
you can provide more valuable information more quickly and completely
than if you go alone.
Medical history
Have you seen your primary care physician about your chief complaint? If
you haven’t, refer to Chapter 4 for a better understanding of why this is such
an important first step. After you explore that avenue, provide your psychia-
trist with the test results and recommendation from your doctor.
Although your primary care physician probably conducted a thorough physi-
cal exam and interview, you can expect your psychiatrist to ask several ques-
tions about your current physical condition as well. Any headaches, weakness,
or dizziness? Diabetes or heart disease? History of stroke or cancer? Eye prob-
lems (such as glaucoma)? Have you had any surgeries? Allergic reactions to
medications? How about your kidneys, liver, and lungs?
Your psychiatrist needs your medical history for two purposes: to help rule
out other physical conditions that may be causing or aggravating your symp-
toms and to determine the safest, most effective medications to prescribe, if
you need medication.
Family history
When you start shaking the family tree of a person who exhibits classic bipo-
lar symptoms, skeletons often rain down from the branches. These skeletons
can help your psychiatrist do the following:
78
Part II: Taming the Bipolar Beast 

 Simplify the diagnosis: If one of the skeletons happens to be a first-
degree relative (immediate family member) with a mood disorder, a
schizophrenia diagnosis, or a history of suicide, your risk of having a
mood disorder is significantly higher (see Chapter 2). Second-degree rel-
atives (uncles, aunts, cousins) count, too, but to a lesser degree.
 Differentiate between unipolar and bipolar depression: If you’re ex-
periencing depression but have a family history of mania or schizophre-
nia, you may have bipolar disorder without yet experiencing mania or
hypomania. Prescribing an antidepressant alone to a person with the
potential of bipolar carries a high risk of inducing mania. If bipolar disor-
der appears in your family history, your psychiatrist is much more likely
to start with a mood stabilizer, with or without the addition of an antide-
pressant, rather than with an antidepressant by itself.
 Determine the most effective medications: If a particular medication or
therapy has effectively treated one of your first-degree relatives, it’s
more likely to effectively treat your similar symptoms.
Following are a few points to keep in mind regarding your family history:
 You may not have a formal diagnosis for people in your family — 
especially in previous generations. But if someone in the family showed
serious behavioral quirks — never left the house, drank or used pills
excessively, or kept tinfoil on the windows to keep out the aliens —
that’s worth mentioning.
 Don’t limit your family history to diagnoses of bipolar disorder. Report
all psychiatric problems: schizophrenia, depression, anxiety disorders,
panic attacks, extreme mood swings, and so on. Different disorders often
share common genetic factors.
 Your doctor will also be curious about any suicides in the family. The
risk of suicide seems to run genetically, even separate from bipolar dis-
order and depression. Substance abuse in a relative can hint at underly-
ing mood or anxiety disorders. Substance abuse and mood disorders
commonly occur in family groupings.
List of legal and . . . yes . . . illegal drugs
Your psychiatrist needs to know about all the chemicals, dietary supple-
ments, and herbs that you pop and pour into your body. You already know
that you need to hand over a list of prescription medications, but don’t over-
look the other stuff, including the following:
 Over-the-counter medications you take regularly
 Vitamins
 Herbs
79
Chapter 5: Getting a Psychiatric Evaluation and Treatment Plan

 Alcohol
 Caffeine
 Energizer beverages, powders, or pills
 Diet medications or herbs
 Nicotine
 Amphetamines or other stimulants or controlled substances
 Marijuana, cocaine, ecstasy, hallucinogens, narcotics, or other 
illicit drugs
If you’re using illicit drugs, tell your doctor. These substances drastically
affect your emotions and behavior, and this information is critical in your
psychiatric evaluation. Embarrassment and worry about being “caught” or
“found out” have no place here. Your psychiatrist won’t report your drug use
to anyone unless you pose a risk to someone else. Brutal honesty is the only
workable policy.
Hiding drug or alcohol use from your doctor can be fatal. Don’t do it. Muster
up all your courage, ditch your shame, and spill your guts. You aid in your
recovery, and you just may save your life.
Sleep log (or sleepless log)
Whether you’re sleepless in Seattle or drowsy in Denver, your doctor needs
to know about it. Sleep changes and energy patterns are core biological 
markers in bipolar disorder; they provide important clues that tell you and
your doctor when you need help. Report any of the following:
 Excessive need for sleep
 Inability to feel rested even after sleeping for a long time
 Persistent fatigue
 Little or no need for sleep
 Significant changes in sleep patterns
Note your sleep cycles and energy levels. Being awake all night and dragging
around the next day is a different story from having a three-day wakeful jag
and still feeling perky.
Remembering how well you sleep from one week to the next can be a chal-
lenge for anyone, so write it down. Also, ask your significant other for 
help; he or she may have an entirely different read on how well or poorly 
you sleep.

Arriving at a Diagnosis
You spilled your guts, confessed your sins, and admitted to doing things that
could have landed you in jail. All you want in return are clear answers to two
simple questions: “What do I have?” and “How do I get rid of it?” You, your
friends, and your significant other have slogged through months of unex-
plained self-destructive and unbearable symptoms, and you need an answer.
Unfortunately, unraveling the mystery may take some time.
Evaluating your symptoms
To arrive at a diagnosis, your doctor compares your symptoms to criteria
specified in the DSM-IV — the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, 4. DSM-IV is the bible of psychiatry that describes various syn-
dromes and conditions and the symptoms that must be present to establish a
particular diagnosis.
What symptoms are characteristic of bipolar disorder? Here are some high-
lights your doctor looks for:
 Evidence of mania: You experience a week or more of high energy,
excessively happy or angry moods, little need for sleep, excessive activ-
ity and pleasure seeking, little judgment or impulse control, grandiose
thinking and behaviors, and racing thoughts (to the degree that they
create problems in your life).
 Evidence of major depression: You experience two weeks or more of
sad mood, low energy, decreased enjoyment of things, poor concentra-
tion, low activity and low productivity, thoughts of death and suicide,
excessive feelings of guilt or bad feelings about yourself, and slowed
thinking (to the degree that they create problems in your life).
 Evidence of hypomania: Consisting of an elevated mood that lasts four
days, hypomania is a “light” version of mania and doesn’t create so
many problems in function, but it can be difficult to live with.
 Presence of psychosis: Psychosis can go along with either “pole”:
depression or mania. It can include disorganized thinking, paranoia,
delusional thinking (significant distortions of reality), or hearing voices.
 Presence of mixed states: Mixed states are combination states that
meet full criteria for mania (or hypomania) and depression together.
Climbing your family tree
Because much of the risk for bipolar disorder comes from inherited genetic
vulnerabilities, family history is an important piece of the diagnostic puzzle.
81
Chapter 5: Getting a Psychiatric Evaluation and Treatment Plan

Although the DSM-IV doesn’t list family history as one of the diagnostic crite-
ria, if the bipolar diagnosis seems plausible but a little fuzzy, a strong family
history may tip the scales.
Considering other causes
After the picture of your mood symptoms has developed, and your family his-
tory is on the table, your psychiatrist must look closely at other symptoms
and problems that you’re having. This differential diagnosis allows her to
explore all the possible causes and to determine if she needs to address addi-
tional diagnoses. The types of symptoms most important at this point are the
following:
 Substance abuse can mimic mood disorders or can occur with and exac-
erbate mania or depression.
 Medical conditions — such as thyroid disorder or other hormone imbal-
ances, infections, autoimmune disorders, cancers, heart disease, or
stroke — can produce similar symptoms.
 Anxiety disorders can sometimes look like mood disorders. Panic
attacks may look like brief manic episodes, for example, and they’re
often comorbid (co-occurring) with bipolar disorder.
 Psychosis, which may be a symptom of mania or depression but also of
schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, must be addressed in order to
rule out those disorders.
 Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder seems to overlap with bipolar
disorder in many people and should be identified when it does. Alterna-
tively, the high energy of mania can sometimes be confused with ADHD,
and the similarity can blur the diagnosis, especially in young people.
Receiving the diagnosis
You’ve been poked and prodded, examined and cross-examined. Your psychi-
atrist has even rummaged through your family tree. Now you want to know:
What is it? What do you have that’s causing you so much discomfort and
misery? This section reveals the most common bipolar diagnoses.
Typecasting your illness
If you’re “lucky,” you step right out of your psychiatrist’s office with a clear,
textbook diagnosis. You have one of the following types of bipolar disorder:
82
Part II: Taming the Bipolar Beast 

 Bipolar I is the classic form of bipolar disorder that includes clear-cut
manic episodes, periods of major depression, and euthymic (even-mood)
times in between. Bipolar I has been recognized for the longest time and
has the most predictable course and response to treatment.
 Bipolar II differs from I in that depressive episodes alternate with hypo-
manic periods rather than manic ones. This variety is often harder to
identify, because hypomanic periods can be tricky to spot and may
remain unreported. Its course is also more variable, and the response to
treatment is less predictable.
 Cyclothymic disorder is a more subdued version of bipolar disorder,
characterized by depressive spells and hypomanic times that never
have sufficient intensity or duration to meet full diagnostic measure. It

When diagnoses converge
Kevin went to see his doctor after dropping out
of college for the third time. Every time he tried
to go to class, he would shrink into the back row
and spend the whole time worrying that people
were thinking about how stupid he was. He
stopped going to class and then dropped out.
After his latest failure, he stayed in his apart-
ment all day and didn’t answer the phone. He
felt like a freak and could barely drag himself
out of bed. All he did was sleep.
While relating his history to his doctor, he
recalled that he had survived high school only
by borrowing friends’ notes, because he hardly
ever went to class. He also confessed that
during his senior year, he started drinking a lot,
and he got into trouble with his parents for
stealing money from them and spending it with
his friends. Senior year was the only time in his
life that he got into trouble with the law — after
he and his friends stole his parents’ car and took
a midnight road trip to check out a bar two
states away. He told the doctor that he slept
very little that year — he spent his nights on the
Internet and practicing his guitar and then
stayed up the following day. He described it as
the “happiest time” of his life, but he had almost
failed all his classes. He noted that his mom had
a drinking problem and seemed to have some
pretty depressed times, but she had never been
diagnosed with a mood disorder.
The doctor arrived at a diagnosis of Bipolar I,
along with Social Anxiety Disorder (see the next
section for more on the different types of bipo-
lar disorder). Over time, as Kevin stabilized with
his mood and anxiety disorder, he tried to go
back to school and discovered he had terrible
trouble paying attention and focusing. Eventu-
ally, the doctor added medication for ADHD.
Given Kevin’s family history, the doctor also
counseled him that he was at high risk for 
alcoholism. Stopping drinking became an ongo-
ing challenge for Kevin, but he remained vigi-
lant. He returned to school — only one class to
start — and found success there. Although
Kevin continues to struggle, he’s gradually leav-
ing the past behind and learning to effectively
deal with his dual diagnosis.

has to be chronic — two years or more — and it must interrupt your life
in some way.
 Bipolar NOS is the “leftover” category, characterized by variations of
cycling mood disorders that reflect episodes of mood problems that inter-
fere with your life but don’t fulfill the complete diagnostic requirements.
For more information on each of these possible diagnoses, refer to Chapter 2.
If you’re not so lucky, and you don’t present textbook-variety symptoms, your
diagnosis may be murky and tentative. Maybe you have an anxiety disorder
with some depression, obsessive compulsive disorder with some characteris-
tics of attention deficit disorder, or a touch of mania with paranoia. In other
words, your diagnostic portrait may look more like an abstract painting. Your
doctor may provide you with an initial diagnosis and then continue watching
your progress over time to confirm, refute, or modify it.
Finding your place on the bipolar spectrum
Having four bipolar categories sure simplifies the diagnosis, but does this
model jibe with reality? Not according to some experts in the field. Psychia-
trists are beginning to find that the four categories are too limited; they fail to
accommodate symptoms and patterns that don’t neatly fit into one of the
84
Part II: Taming the Bipolar Beast 
Treating unipolar depression with mood stabilizers
Current scientific evidence suggests that
people with recurrent, severe depressions are
more like people who suffer from bipolar
depression than they’re like people with single
or infrequent episodes of unipolar depression.
Some research has revealed a significant over-
lap between the family histories and treatment-
response profiles of all patients with severe,
cycling mood episodes, even if they experience
only one pole (depression) instead of two poles
(bipolar). (Frederick K. Goodwin, MD, former
director of the National Institute of Mental
Health, is a leader in this field of research.)
If the research proves true, the treatment rec-
ommendations for unipolar depression may
change significantly. Traditionally, doctors
treated most cases of unipolar depression with
antidepressants. Now, doctors are becoming
more cautious in their use of antidepressants.
Psychiatrists will look closely for red flags, such
as a family history of bipolar or particular pat-
terns of the patient’s depression, to try to deter-
mine the risk of triggering agitation or mania in
a depressed patient. If the doctor spots red
flags, she may consider using a mood stabilizer
or a potentially less irritating antidepressant as
a first choice.

four categories. A growing trend is to diagnose mood disorders on a sliding
scale, or spectrum. You may hear of the bipolar spectrum or the unipolar
depressive spectrum.
The purpose of the bipolar spectrum is to help identify the disorder in people
who don’t exhibit classic symptoms — for example, a depressed bipolar suf-
ferer who has never experienced hypomania or mania. Misdiagnosing this
person with unipolar depression can be dangerous, because treatment with
an antidepressant alone is likely to induce mania. By finding the person a
place on the bipolar spectrum, the psychiatrist can begin treatment with a
mood stabilizer and probably achieve better results.
Don’t be surprised if your diagnosis changes over time; symptoms commonly
change over the course of the illness. You may be diagnosed with Bipolar II
and then experience a full-blown manic episode that changes your diagnosis
to Bipolar I. This doesn’t mean that your initial diagnosis was wrong — only
that that course of your illness has changed.
Gauging the severity of your illness
The severity of bipolar disorder varies from one person to the next. Some
people may go for years without a major mood episode, whereas others cycle
four or more times a year. A depressive episode can drag on for months or
end in a matter of days. Some individuals have only mild depressions and
hypomanic episodes that barely interfere with their ability to function.
Determining the severity or predicting the overall course of the disorder is
difficult, but the following factors clue you in to what you can expect:
 The presence of psychosis commonly marks more severe mood episodes.
 Early onset of the disorder, in childhood or adolescence in particular,
often indicates increased severity and predicts a worsening of the mood
episodes over time.
 An increase in the frequency, duration, and intensity of mood swings
over time often indicates that the disorder is more severe.
 An early and full response to medication, such as lithium, often indicates
a milder form of the disorder with a more positive prognosis over the
course of your life.
 Rapid cycling may indicate a type of bipolar disorder that may be more
difficult to treat.
85
Chapter 5: Getting a Psychiatric Evaluation and Treatment Plan

You and your doctor can and should discuss these factors. Although some
factors may indicate a harsher outcome, no factor locks in your destiny.
Stress management, lifestyle changes, and careful and comprehensive med-
ical management over time can significantly diminish the severity of symp-
toms and improve the course of the disorder.
Pushing the Limits of Psychiatric Labels
Your reaction to your diagnosis depends on many factors, including but not
limited to your personal experience with people who have bipolar disorder,
your awareness of the science and information about bipolar disorder, the
attitudes about mental illness you grew up with, and your recollections of
Hollywood characters with “manic depression.” In the movies, people with
bipolar disorder are wildly out of control; they’re either dangerous villains or
pitiful victims. Psychiatrists are always weird and creepy, and the “cure” is
magical and complete or a sadistic failure.
A host of social reactions to mental illness may influence your responses.
How will people see you and judge you? Will your employer fire you? Will
your landlord evict you? The questions swirl through your mind and spark
panic. So what exactly is the point of the bipolar label? Why do you need this
in your life, and what are its benefits and limitations? The following list pro-
vides some answers:
 A diagnosis guides treatment decisions. Just like a diagnosis of diabetes
tells the doctor to initiate a certain treatment regimen, a diagnosis of
bipolar disorder triggers the planning process of medication and ther-
apy choices.
 A diagnosis lets you know what to expect over time. Although the
doctor can’t see the future outcome of a complicated illness like bipolar
disorder, he can anticipate certain risks and patterns you’re likely to
encounter over the course of the illness and possibly help you avoid them.
 A bipolar diagnosis doesn’t define you. You’re not bipolar; you have
bipolar disorder. This is a huge difference, because language conveys
powerful meanings. Always refer to your illness as something you’re
managing, not as a label that identifies you.
 You choose whether and with whom you want to share your diagno-
sis. Your doctor and therapist can’t reveal your condition to anyone
unless you give them permission to do so. You can’t be fired or evicted
based on your diagnosis, even if the word does get out. Your civil rights
demand that you not be discriminated against because of the diagnosis.
86
Part II: Taming the Bipolar Beast 

 Some people may judge you based on your diagnosis. Judgment is a
risk that comes with the label. Your task is to remember that these
people are uninformed and afraid. You may choose to advocate, edu-
cate, and inform sometimes, but in other situations you may choose to
limit your interactions with these people and keep a healthy distance
from them.
 Your label places you in a community of people with similar concerns.
You have opportunities for support and networking that will be invalu-
able over the years. People who are going through the same situation
band together in many ways — formal and informal — to take care of
one another and advocate for the group. Others have “been there” —
you know that from your labels — and they “get it.”
Walking Out with a Treatment Plan
When you’re ready to leave the doctor’s office, you should have more than a
diagnosis. You want to have a well-defined treatment plan that covers your
immediate needs and future directions. Ask questions about anything in the
plan that you don’t understand. Don’t be afraid to bring a written list of ques-
tions to ask your doctor. With all that goes on during your first few appoint-
ments, you may easily and understandably forget to express your most
pressing concerns and ask your most important questions. Write down the
treatment plan as your doctor describes it (if you have someone with you,
this can be a job you assign).
Get several of your doctor’s business cards so that you can give them to
other caregivers, such as your therapist, family doctor, and cardiologist.
Nobody expects you to carry around contact information in your head — 
just keep it in your wallet or purse.
Your treatment plan should include the following:
 Medication names, dosing schedules, potential side effects, and time
frames for them to begin working (you should have some understanding
of why your doctor chose these particular medicines for you at this time)
 Any changes in your current medications — decreasing doses or chang-
ing times of medications you were taking before this visit, for example
 A plan for therapy, including the recommended type of therapy, names
and phone numbers of potential therapists, and/or consent forms for
your psychiatrist to speak to your current therapist
87
Chapter 5: Getting a Psychiatric Evaluation and Treatment Plan

 Forms necessary for any blood tests, other medical consultations, or
examinations that your psychiatrist recommends
 Instructions on how to reach your doctor if you have a problem or emer-
gency before the next visit
 Information about how often you need to meet with the psychiatrist, how
long the appointments will be, and how much the follow-up visits cost
 (Optional) Names of support groups in your area or online resources or
books that your doctor feels can help you
Psychiatrist appointments, particularly at times of the day that work for you,
are hard to come by. Before you leave (or right after your visit, if you have to
call the office to make the appointment), schedule a series of appointments
for four to six months out. This gives you the appointments that you need at
times you can get there without turning your life inside out. If you stabilize
and need less frequent appointments, you can always cancel, as long as you
let the doctor know well in advance.

Building a Winning Mood-
Management Team
In This Chapter
 Appreciating the roles your psychiatrist plays
 Teaming up with a competent and versatile therapist
 Recruiting supportive friends and family members
 Adding support groups to your team
 Planning ahead for potential crises
You can successfully treat many common ailments on your own. You can
pop an antacid tablet to relieve indigestion, sip some lemon tea at the
first sign of a cold, or down a couple of aspirin to ease headache pain. Bipolar
disorder is more sinister. You can be so blinded by the darkness of depres-
sion or so bewildered by the maelstrom of mania that you can’t recognize
your altered state of mind, let alone settle on an effective treatment.
If it takes a village to raise a child, it takes at least a small team to help you
prevent your moods from swinging out of control: a psychiatrist, a therapist,
and one or more supportive family members or friends. Your psychiatrist
typically makes the diagnosis and prescribes the medications that enable
your brain to function properly; your therapist helps you solve problems,
develop coping skills, and let go of issues beyond your control; and family
members and friends provide feedback, support, and encouragement.
In this chapter, you begin to build your mood-management team. You dis-
cover the key role that each person on your team plays and the criteria
required for each position. You also find out how to track down and select
qualified professionals and supportive friends and family members to add to
your team roster.

The Head Doctor: Your Psychiatrist’s
Position on the Team
When your brain functions properly, it reacts appropriately to stimulation.
Someone cuts you off in traffic; you angrily honk your horn. You win a spot
on American Idol; you jump for joy. When your brain malfunctions, it may
overreact or react inappropriately. You may feel depressed at parties or excited
when your sister-in-law starts showing slides of her new kitchen cabinets.
When your moods are out of sync with reality, your brain’s physiology or
chemistry may be off balance. A psychiatrist, fondly referred to by many with
bipolar disorder as a p-doc, helps adjust the biochemistry of your brain to
enable it to respond appropriately. This doesn’t cure your bipolar disorder,
but it helps regulate your moods so you can function and begin to deal with
real-life issues that may trigger mood swings.
Your psychiatrist’s two main functions are to accurately diagnose your illness
and to prescribe the appropriate medications to treat it.
A psychiatrist is a medical doctor who has specialized training in treating
mental illnesses. Doctors who’ve successfully completed this rigorous train-
ing may not be the most warm and fuzzy individuals, although many are very
amiable. When choosing a psychiatrist, remember that knowledge and ex-
perience trump congeniality.
Diagnostician
Before you can begin any sensible treatment, you need a diagnosis, and your
psychiatrist is the one who gives it to you. During your first visit, your psy-
chiatrist typically asks a series of questions:
 What events brought you here?
 What are your symptoms?
The psychiatrist may pry out symptoms that you may not think to
report but that indicate important diagnostic information for bipolar dis-
order or another co-existing condition. Psychiatrists often refer to this
as a review of systems (see Chapter 5 for more on symptoms).
 How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?
 Have you consulted your primary care physician concerning these
symptoms (see Chapter 4), and what diagnosis, if any, has your physi-
cian suggested?
90
Part II: Taming the Bipolar Beast 

 Are you currently receiving treatment for your condition?
 Are you currently taking any medications, supplements, drugs, 
or alcohol?
 Have any family members, past or present, been diagnosed with a
mental illness?
Your psychiatrist may also have you complete questionnaires or scales, such
as the Hamilton Depression Scale or the Young Mania Rating Scale, to aid in
the diagnosis. Your psychiatrist uses all this information to perform a psychi-
atric evaluation, which he or she uses to determine a likely diagnosis. The
diagnosis probably won’t become official until the psychiatrist observes how
you and your condition progress over time and in response to treatment.
If you’re seeking treatment for depression, and you or your relatives have
experienced mania or hypomania, make sure that you inform the psychia-
trist. Many antidepressants can induce mania and worsen the course of 
your illness.
Medicine man (or woman)
In the old days, psychiatrists handled all aspects of treatment. The psychia-
trist diagnosed the illness, prescribed any necessary medications, and offered
therapy and counseling. Managed healthcare has redefined the role of the
psychiatrist. Nowadays, some psychiatrists spend more time scribbling on
prescription pads than they do counseling their patients. Insurance compa-
nies often allocate no more than 15 minutes per visit for “medication manage-
ment.” Caseworkers, social workers, and psychotherapists provide the talk
therapy that many psychiatrists performed in the past.
If the time you spend with your psychiatrist is insufficient for successfully
communicating your needs, voice your concern. Your insurance company
may allow an exception for one or two visits, or you may be able to make spe-
cial arrangements with your psychiatrist.
The Lifestyle Director: 
Your Therapist’s Roles
Some people mistakenly believe that after a psychiatrist effectively tweaks
brain function with the right brew of medications, the problem is solved.
However, your body constantly showers your brain with mind-altering sub-
stances that it manufactures 24 hours a day in its own chemical factories.
91
Chapter 6: Building a Winning Mood-Management Team

Perceptions and your body’s reaction to those perceptions play a significant
role in the flow of those chemicals and in how your brain responds to them.
You may be taking an effective maintenance dose of a mood stabilizer, but if
you live under constant stress, your system’s reaction can easily override the
mood-moderating effects of the mood stabilizer.
Your therapist’s primary role is to help you make positive lifestyle changes
that reduce stress and establish healthy thinking patterns, enabling you to
cope more effectively with unavoidable stress. A therapist, for example, may
teach you techniques for identifying problems and developing solutions
rather than allowing your brain to follow a defeatist thought pattern.
A therapist can play many additional roles on your mood-management team,
acting as coach, career consultant, mood monitor, and wellness manager. We
discuss these roles in the following sections.
The therapist and psychiatrist often function as co-leaders of your team, and
their roles may overlap to some degree. Psychiatrists often play some role in
therapy, education, and support functions, and therapists, with their patients’
permission, may contact psychiatrists to voice concerns when they think
medication adjustments are needed.
Coach, trainer, and referee
An effective therapist treats all aspects of your life that may be suffering from
bipolar disorder or worsening the illness:
 Your thought process, which can often darken your perceptions and
create a vortex that spins you into a deeper depression
 Relationship issues that may act as stressors
The issues may have arisen from something you said or did as a result of
your mood-disorder symptoms.
 Family issues, such as raising children or managing finances
 Career changes, problems on the job, or personality conflicts with co-
workers that may cause stress at work
 Social situations that stress you out or that have suffered due to 
your illness
Scout for a therapist who specializes in the form of therapy you need most.
Chapter 8 describes types of therapies proved to effectively treat bipolar 
disorder.

Mood monitor
You can and should monitor your moods, as we explain in Chapter 12, but
when depression weighs on you like a lead blanket or mania thrusts your
moods into the dizzying stratosphere, remaining motivated and objective
enough to create an accurate mood map may be nearly impossible. And
friends and family members may be too busy tending to their own needs to
be of much help.
Your therapist can function as a mood thermometer, providing you with objec-
tive observations concerning your moods and demeanor. Sometimes mood
observations are easier to accept from a third party than from a loved one.
Resident soundboard
Some of the best therapists offer the least advice. They sit and listen atten-
tively as patients rant and rave about a particular issue. They use a little
body language to indicate their interest, but they say very little. Often, airing
out your issues allows you to calm down and begin to realize that you
already know the solution to your problem.
If you can find a therapist who listens well and who inspires you to solve
your own problems, you’ve struck gold. But keep in mind that this is only one
role that a therapist plays. When your moods are cycling, a good therapist
usually needs to play a much more active role.
Wellness manager
One of the most important factors in the success of long-term management of
bipolar disorder is the continuity of treatment. If you shuffle from one psychia-
trist or therapist to the next, your moods are likely to fluctuate with every
shift in treatment. Unfortunately, changes in health insurance and other fac-
tors outside of your control often lead to changes in doctors and treatments.
To achieve continuity of treatment, you must often rely on yourself or on a
caseworker or therapist to establish and maintain your treatment plan.
Referral service
Therapists are people who know people. If your therapist can’t solve your
problem, she probably has the name and contact information of a specialist
93
Chapter 6: Building a Winning Mood-Management Team

who can. She’ll dig through her desk and hand you a business card or flip
through her day planner and rattle off the name, address, and phone number
of a specialist you need. Buried in debt? Here’s a financial consultant that my
other clients rave about! Need a job? Here’s the name of a career coach I
know. Need a break from the drudgery of daily life? Here’s the travel agent I
use. Can’t pay me? Here’s some information on government-subsidized health
insurance.
Assembling the Rest of Your Support
Staff: Family and Friends
A strong support network of family and friends can function as a valuable ally
in the battle against mood swings. However, if your allies have their own
agendas and their own emotional baggage to lug around, they can compound
your problem and trigger mood swings by being a little too helpful. When you
begin recruiting your support staff, you need to decide whom you can trust,
establish an understanding of everyone’s fears and anxieties, and educate
your network about your illness and what they can do to help.
94
Part II: Taming the Bipolar Beast 
Therapy: It’s a family affair
Bipolar experts have found that family therapy
(see Chapter 8), including a healthy dose of edu-
cation about bipolar disorder, is highly effective
in helping people with bipolar disorder establish
and maintain a stable mood. Family therapy has
two primary goals: to build empathy for the
person who has the disorder and to improve
communication skills among family members.
Family members discover how to listen to one
another, express themselves without appearing
confrontational, avoid unproductive arguments,
and set limits that prevent the illness from over-
taxing the family. Family members who can
empathize and communicate effectively remove
one of the primary stressors that can trigger a
mood episode.
Family therapy is even more critical to families
that have more than one member with bipolar
disorder. People with bipolar disorder often
gravitate to one another because of their mutual
appreciation for the highs and lows, and pairs
of sufferers often end up marrying — a phe-
nomenon called assortative mating. Marriage
pairs two people who have fluctuating moods,
which can often make for a very volatile rela-
tionship. If the couple has children, the kids
have a higher likelihood of developing bipolar
disorder.

Building a network based on trust
When scouting for family members or friends to add to your support net-
work, look for stable and trustworthy people. Ask yourself the following
questions:
 Can I confide in this person? Some parasites buddy up to people who
have problems just so they can obtain some juicy gossip to pass along.
Your support staff should know how to keep discussions confidential.
 Is this person stable enough to help me? People with bipolar disorder
commonly are drawn to others who enjoy roller-coaster moods and
emotions. Only someone who’s steady can help you steady yourself.
 Do I see this person frequently enough? An ideal support person sees
you at least once a week to determine if you’ve experienced any signifi-
cant shift in mood. Of course, the more people you have in your support
network, the more objective observers you have to monitor your moods.
 Does this person judge me for having a mental illness? If this person
thinks that your mental illness is due to a character flaw, he or she can’t
provide the support you need. You don’t need people who make you feel
guilty for having the illness.
 Is this person reliable? If you foresee this person bailing out at the first
sign of trouble, you know he won’t be there when you need him most.
 Does this person respect me? You don’t want an intrusive caretaker
who constantly nags you about your moods and meds and treats you
like a child.
Understanding their fears, anxieties,
anger, and other emotions
Family and friends who genuinely care about you and appreciate your unique
gifts can often get under your skin, especially when they want to help and
especially during a mood episode. They have fears, anxieties, anger, and other
emotions, too. As you’re battling a lengthy bout of depression, they may be
anxious, not knowing how long it will last, or angry that you don’t “seem” to
be doing enough to help yourself. When you’re in the throes of mania, your
loved ones may be unable to understand you or tell you to calm down.
Something you say or do may trigger strong negative emotions. Although
some people have thicker skins than others, nobody’s skin is impervious.
Chapter 10 reveals how people commonly perceive and respond to manic 
and depressive episodes.

Chapter 6: Building a Winning Mood-Management Team

Educating your supporters
Whenever you throw a party, you usually have several guests who strategi-
cally avoid the after-party cleanup. If you’re lucky, one or two close friends
who know their way around your kitchen will start tidying up. You may see a
couple others who linger around, waiting to be told what to do.
You can observe many of these same human behaviors in your support staff.
If you’re depressed or manic, most people who don’t understand what’s
going on or what you expect of them flee the scene. If they don’t bolt, they
stick around, become frustrated by not knowing what to do, and lose their
tempers or pepper you with sarcasm. What you want is a close friend or rela-
tive who knows about mood disorders to intervene and provide a firm, guid-
ing hand to help you stabilize.
You want as many knowledgeable people on your mood-management team as
possible, and the only way to achieve that goal is to educate the members
who want to learn and are committed to helping you succeed. Knowledge
gives people the information they need to help and the confidence to jump in
when you need them most. Whenever friends or family members ask what
they can do to help, encourage them to discover more about bipolar disor-
der, drawing from any of the following resources:
 You: You’re the most qualified expert in the world on your moods and
what keeps them stable. If you feel ready to discuss your situation with
others, you can be an incredibly valuable source of information.
 Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance (DBSA): An organization
focusing on bipolar disorder and depression and run by and for patients,
DBSA offers free and confidential support groups for patients, families,
and friends living with depression or bipolar disorder. DBSA also offers
free educational materials written in a language you can understand.
Check out the DBSA Web site at www.dbsalliance.org.
 NAMI Family to Family: The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI)
offers a 10-week course called Family to Family that educates friends and
family members about major mental illnesses and the available treatments.
The course also functions as a support group, encouraging friends and
family members to express their feelings about the illness and how it
has affected them. Check out the NAMI Web site at www.nami.org.
 Books: This book and many others on bipolar disorder can help friends
and family members empathize and can teach them what they can do to
help. Chapter 16 focuses specifically on what you can do to help a loved
one who has bipolar disorder.
 Audio and videotapes: Audiotapes, videotapes, and television specials
about bipolar disorder typically don’t delve into what loved ones can do
96
Part II: Taming the Bipolar Beast 

to help, but they do help build empathy, which is the first step toward
loved ones becoming more accepting and understanding.
 Movies: Although Hollywood takes a little poetic license with “true” sto-
ries, some movies, including A Beautiful Mind and Frances, help remove
the stigma of mental illness.
 Web sites: Several Web sites offer excellent information about bipolar
disorder and provide information specifically for friends and family
members of people who suffer from bipolar disorder.
When researching bipolar disorder on the Web, remain skeptical. The Web
has plenty of excellent information, but it also attracts its share of quacks
and weekend quarterbacks. Before following any home remedies or miracle
cures, consult your doctor.
Setting your team’s level of involvement
A good supporter remains vigilant, helping you monitor your moods and
watch for signs of trouble. The person needs to have the sensitivity to know
when to remain silent and when to voice concerns and the strength to step in
and help when you need it most, especially when you can’t or don’t want to
ask for or accept assistance. Although such people are rare, you can help
your loved ones become a better support staff by educating them about bipo-
lar disorder and by communicating your needs and defining the parameters
for assisting you.
You’re probably aware that some people, if you let them, will gladly volunteer
to live your life for you. They’d be happy to cook your meals, clean your
house, raise your kids, and maybe even pay your bills (with your money, of
course), all in the name of charity. Such assistance may seem nice in the
short term, when you really need help, but when charity becomes chronic
and invasive, the lifesaver quickly becomes an anchor. Beware of the follow-
ing personality types:
 The Nagger: “Did you take your meds today?” Every day, sometimes two
or three times a day, you can expect this nagging question. If you want
or need to be reminded to take your medications, the Nagger can be
useful; otherwise, nagging is just another stressor.
 The Clueless: A Clueless helper watches you, but he never does or says
anything that he thinks may offend you. You can be teetering on the
edge of the cliff, and Clueless will patiently watch the events unfold.
 The Party Animal: If you’re prone to having fun and enduring hypomanic
episodes that entail spending sprees, bar-hopping, wild sex, and other
frenetic activities, you can find plenty of Party Animals to join you, but
97
Chapter 6: Building a Winning Mood-Management Team

they usually don’t stick around very long after the hangover. Avoid
people who try to inspire you to do things that you wouldn’t do in a
healthier frame of mind.
 The Heavy: Unlike the Party Animal, who encourages you to have too
much fun, the Heavy doesn’t let you have any fun at all. And that’s 
not . . . well, any fun. You should be able to enjoy a full life within the
limits you set for yourself.
Encouraging open communication
Announcing that you have bipolar is a foolproof way to silence an audience.
Most people don’t know what to say, so they instantly go mute. In some
cases, that’s the desired effect, but when approaching your support staff, 
you want to encourage open communication.
Communicating openly about bipolar disorder serves two main functions:
 It helps your supporters understand you and your condition more 
intimately.
 It helps you become more in tune with how your moods, emotions, and
behaviors affect those around you.
Establishing a relationship is like learning to dance together. You and your
partner must move in sync, and communication is the key. At first, you step
on each other’s toes quite frequently, but as you become more accustomed
to each other’s movements, you begin to instinctively move to the rhythms
that surround you. Here are some techniques that can open the channels of
communication so you can start working on your rhythm:
 Write down what you want to discuss in advance.
 Sit down in a quiet, private place whenever you need to discuss confi-
dential topics.
 Agree on a physical sign or secret word that you can use to end the dis-
cussion, no questions asked, if it becomes too heated.
 Encourage your friend or loved one to ask questions about bipolar disor-
der and how it makes you feel.
 Ask your friend or loved one to describe his or her observations and
emotions concerning your moods and behaviors. How is bipolar disor-
der affecting your loved one’s life and his or her ability to satisfy per-
sonal needs?
98
Part II: Taming the Bipolar Beast 

You can help a person become more knowledgeable about bipolar disorder
and about your needs, but you can’t force anyone to accept you or the ill-
ness. Some people, due to their own limitations, may not be ready to accept
the illness and adapt to a new reality. For your own mental wellness, you may
need some distance from these people for a while.
Working as a Team
The key players on your mood-management team should all be able to com-
municate openly with one another to ensure that you receive comprehensive,
integrated treatment. If your therapist notices that your moods are fluctuat-
ing or that you seem more anxious and irritable than usual, she should be
able to contact your psychiatrist to make a joint decision on how to proceed.
You may need a medication adjustment or additional therapy sessions.
An effective strategy is to put one member of your support staff (or yourself,
if you feel up to it) in charge of communications. Your communications man-
ager should introduce the members of your mood-management team and
ensure that critical information gets passed along. Such communication is
especially important in situations when complications or transitions, such as
the following, arise:
 Hospitalization: Some hospitals have their own doctors in charge of
treatment, so when you’re hospitalized, the psychiatrist who usually sees
you may no longer be in charge of your care. Communication between
your psychiatrist and the new doctor at the hospital is essential.
 Hospital release: Before the hospital releases you, your regular psychia-
trist, therapist, and the person acting as your primary caretaker need to
be informed in advance so they can provide a smooth transition to the
outside world and make any necessary arrangements.
 Changing doctors: When you change doctors or therapists, you should
make sure that your records are transferred to the new doctor or therapist.
Because of privacy laws, you may need to sign a release with each doctor and
therapist you see so they can openly communicate with one another. You
may also need to sign a letter that enables your doctor or therapist to dis-
cuss your treatment with specific friends or family members.
99
Chapter 6: Building a Winning Mood-Management Team

Extending Your Family to 
Local Support Groups
Friends and family have much more invested in your health and well being
than any third party, including your psychiatrist or therapist, but others who
suffer from bipolar disorder may have much more to offer in terms of empa-
thy, information, and connections. Bipolar support groups commonly offer
the following perks:
 A place where you can vent your frustrations
 Camaraderie with others who share your experiences and emotions
 Understanding that a mood disorder doesn’t define who you are
 Motivation to follow your treatment plan
 The ability to rediscover strengths and humor you thought you lost
when you became ill
 Information on medications, treatments, and therapies
 Patient perspectives of local doctors and therapists, both positive 
and negative
 Information about your legal rights
 Information about education and IEPs (Individualized Education Plans)
for children with bipolar disorder
 A library of books and videos
 Featured speakers
You can tap into the resources a support group offers by joining up.
Organizations such as the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance (DBSA)
and NAMI (National Alliance of the Mentally Ill) sponsor support groups in
most cities and many towns to help people who suffer from mental illnesses
find peer support and to encourage advocacy. To find out about support
groups in your area, contact the following organizations or resources:
 Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance: Call 1-800-826-3632, or look
on the Web at www.dbsalliance.org.
 National Alliance for the Mentally Ill: Call 1-800-950-6264, or look on the
Web at www.nami.org. Click the link for State & Local NAMIs to locate
contact information for local NAMI groups.
 National Mental Health Association: Call 1-800-969-6642, or look on the
Web at www.nmha.org.
 Your place of worship: Many churches provide meeting places for sup-
port groups, including those affiliated with DBSA and NAMI.
100
Part II: Taming the Bipolar Beast 

 Your psychiatrist or therapist: Ask your psychiatrist or therapist for
information about local support groups. Your therapist may run a sup-
port group that meets regularly.
 State or county mental health centers: Most states and large counties
have mental health services that can refer you to support groups in 
your area.
What can you expect when you walk through the doors into your first support-
group session? That depends on the makeup of the group and its organization.
Some support groups are more structured than others and may include a fea-
tured speaker. Others encourage members to vent their emotions or exchange
any information they have about medications, treatments, doctors, and ther-
apists. Generally, you can expect members to welcome you with open arms.
People in support groups are very open and are more than willing to lend an
empathetic ear.
Every support group has its own chemistry and dynamic, so don’t give up if
you feel out of place at the first support group you visit. Try a few groups
until you find one that feels comfortable.
Teaming Up for Crisis Prevention 
and Management
In the depths of depression and in the irrational throes of mania, you may be
much less able to make wise decisions. When overcome by your symptoms,
taking your own life may seem like a good idea to you. It never is. This is the
time when the people closest to you can do the most to help protect you
from yourself.
With so much riding on the outcome, those around you may need to make
healthcare choices for you. They may need to contact your psychiatrist or
another person on your support team, call an emergency number, or even
help you check into the hospital.
Although you may need to pass the decision-making duties to someone 
else, you can retain some control by making your preferences known in
advance, and we explain how in the following sections. For more information
about advance directives — legal documents that can help you state your
treatment preferences — visit www.DBSAlliance.org/Resources/
AdvanceDirectives.html.
When you’re in a healthy frame of mind, the last thing you want to think
about is being sick again, but healthy times are the best times to write up
your emergency plan.
101
Chapter 6: Building a Winning Mood-Management Team

Providing your team with contact 
information and emergency numbers
Few people carry around lists of phone numbers to call if they get hit by a car
or fall off a cliff. If you’re physically harmed to the point where you can’t dial
a phone, somebody will call an ambulance, and the authorities will manage to
get in touch with your family.
But what happens when depression has you bedridden or when mania has
you so wired that your thoughts, words, and actions are out of your control?
As long as you aren’t physically harmed or you’re not physically harming
someone else, destroying property, or stealing stuff, society pretty much
looks the other way. Unfortunately, looking the other way compounds the
problem, so make sure that the people on your support team know whom to
contact when your mood swings outside of your control:
 Primary physician’s name and phone number
 Psychiatrist’s name and phone number
 Therapist’s name and phone number
 Health insurance company name, phone number, and your identifica-
tion number
 Workplace phone number and supervisor’s name
You should also state how much detail your workplace needs to know. It
may be sufficient for your support people to tell your boss you’re very
ill if you haven’t made your bipolar disorder common knowledge at work.
 Close relatives’ names and phone numbers
 Primary support person’s name and phone number (typically, a spouse,
parent, sibling, or close friend)
Type the contact information on a small piece of paper, and make copies to
place in your wallet or purse and to provide to the members of your support
team. See Chapter 17 for more information on planning for a crisis.
Opening and closing your team’s 
lines of communication
Banks, doctors, dentists, insurance companies, and even cable companies that
have potentially sensitive information on file about you have privacy policies
that specify the limitations of how they can use and share the information you
102
Part II: Taming the Bipolar Beast 

provide. Unless you specifically request otherwise, your doctor, psychiatrist,
and therapist are required by law to keep your information confidential — in
most cases, anyway. If a doctor believes you’re at imminent risk of hurting
yourself or someone else, he’s legally obligated to break confidentiality to try
to prevent harm.
However, if you designate a support person to make decisions for you and to
help ensure continuity of treatment while you’re incapacitated, that person
needs to have access to your doctor and therapist to obtain and provide
information critical for proper treatment. When you feel well, make sure you
communicate to your psychiatrist and therapist that you want them to share
information with this person or people on your support staff. Also, make sure
that you sign any necessary releases.
To ensure that you receive comprehensive, integrated care, make sure that
your psychiatrist and therapist sign a release so that they can communicate
openly with one another and coordinate the various components of your
treatment plan.
Expressing your desires regarding 
inpatient or outpatient treatment
Nowadays, hospitalization is reserved primarily for crisis management 
and safety intervention. In most cases, you don’t check in for the long term.
Although you may be scared and unwilling to check in, keep in mind that 
the ultimate goal is to get stable. Listen to the support people around you.
Ask yourself as honestly as possible: Are you functioning? Can you go about
your day-to-day life? If not, get the help you need so you can function on 
the outside.
If you’re actively harming yourself or others or pose an imminent risk to
yourself or to someone else, hospitalization may be necessary. Voluntary
hospitalization is much easier for everyone than involuntary hospitalization.
Signing yourself into the hospital may be the best action you can take to lib-
erate your mind and life from the chaos they’re in. You have the most control
over the course and length of your hospitalization if you sign in voluntarily.
Hospitalization is almost always a short-term solution intended to stabilize
your moods and emotions. Most hospital personnel are highly motivated to
return you to your home and support network so you can begin to manage
your recovery with or without the assistance of outpatient care.
You may be scared going in. That’s normal. If you’re experiencing paranoia 
as one of the symptoms, you may even believe that someone is hospitalizing
you to harm you or get you out of the way.
103
Chapter 6: Building a Winning Mood-Management Team

If you’re not a threat to yourself or others, other options may be more
appealing and just as effective:
 Home: Assuming your home isn’t full of stressors that exacerbate your
mood swings, home is generally the best place to recover.
 A friend’s home: If your home environment is too frenzied, try staying at
the home of a friend who has a more placid, organized household. You
want a quiet place to recover. Moving from one stressful environment to
another is futile.

Finding alternative living arrangements
The Christmas holidays always put Debra on
edge, but this one was shaping up to be the
worst. The stress at work was unbearable, and
she became irritable at home when everything
wasn’t just right. Discussions with her husband,
Paul, quickly escalated into yelling matches,
and everyone in the family felt as though they
needed to walk on eggshells to keep from
upsetting Debra.
Debra was seeing her family doctor for depres-
sion and anxiety and tried several different anti-
depressants, each of which temporarily eased
the sadness but made her more anxious and
uptight. She wasn’t sleeping and began to feel
as though her marriage and family were slipping
away. She became convinced that Paul was
planning to move out and take the kids.
Debra’s doctor referred her to a psychiatrist, but
by the time she got in, she felt as though she
was ready to crawl out of her skin. During her
interview with her doctor, her moods shifted 
visibly. One minute she was ranting about her
boss, and the next minute she began crying
because her family had turned against her.
During the session, she accused Paul of having
her followed, which he denied.
The psychiatrist recommended that she check
into the hospital, where he could observe 
her and adjust her medications, but she flatly
refused. She glared at Paul and warned, “Don’t
you dare!” She said she would do anything to
stay out of the hospital. Paul had his own reser-
vations about hospitals, so he agreed that hos-
pitalization should remain the last resort, but he
was exhausted and angry and didn’t want
Debra back home in her state. He recom-
mended that she stay with a relative or friend,
which Debra was willing to try. She became too
stressed at her parents’ house, so they ruled out
that option. They also ruled out Debra’s friend
Susan’s apartment, because Susan and Debra
often partied late into the morning. Debra and
Paul decided to contact their church, and the
pastor directed them to a couple who had a
bedroom available. One of them was always
home, and the house was very peaceful and
orderly.
Debra stayed at the couple’s home for two
weeks while she received intensive outpatient
therapy. The doctor started her on Depakote.
After her stay, she returned home to continue
treatment. She and Paul also began seeing a
therapist to work on financial issues and other
disagreements, and the entire family learned
new communication skills that cut down on the
emotional noise. Debra and Paul haven’t lived
apart since, and they’ll always be thankful to the
generous couple who gave Debra a safe place
to stay during their crisis.

 Halfway house: If you can’t live at home or don’t have a place to stay,
you may be able to stay in a halfway house until your moods stabilize.
 Intensive outpatient care: In intensive outpatient care, you generally
receive therapy, monitoring, and medication adjustments during the day
and return home in the evening.
Stating your preferred hospital
When preparing for a possible crisis, choose the hospital that best meets
your needs — assuming, of course, that you have two or more hospitals
nearby that provide appropriate care. When comparing hospitals, consider
the following:
 Does the hospital provide inpatient care for mental illnesses?
 Is the hospital covered on your insurance, assuming you have health
insurance that covers mental illness?
 Does your doctor/therapist think highly of this hospital?
 Can your psychiatrist continue to treat you at this hospital?
 Does the hospital seem to be clean and orderly? You may want to visit
the hospital when you’re feeling well; however, due to privacy issues,
you may be able to see only the waiting area.

n order to achieve success in any field of endeavor, you
should get to know the tools of the trade. That goes for
using your computer, playing golf, and even whipping up a
gourmet meal in the kitchen. But it’s even more critical
when it comes to treating bipolar disorder. The right mix
of medication, therapy, and persistence can bring mood
swings under control and maintain their stability. But
which medications are most effective? What are the risks?
And which therapies hold out the most promise?
The chapters in this part answer all these questions and
more. Here, we open the medicine cabinet and take a look
at what the most promising pharmaceuticals have to offer.
We explain the challenges of treating bipolar disorder with
medications and reveal some tips and techniques to
improve success. We explore therapies that continue to
help those with bipolar disorder and additional therapies
to assist families and relationships. Finally, we explore
optional and complementary treatments, including herbs,
vitamins, nutrients, and light therapy.

W
ithout some changes in mood, life would be agonizingly boring, and
nobody wants that. What you really want is a regulator that you can
affix to your mind’s speedometer — something that keeps it traveling between
0 and 65 miles per hour and prevents any sudden changes in speed.
Prescription medications offer great hope, but the magic pill remains elusive.
Medications work differently for everyone; a godsend to some may be a dis-
aster for others. Medications that you find effective in normalizing your
moods may cause irritating side effects for others. And medications that
work today may lose their effects later.
We can’t tell you which medications are best for you, but in this chapter, we
explore the basics of developing and maintaining a safe and effective medica-
tion regimen. We introduce you to currently available medications that have
proved useful in treating the most common bipolar symptoms. We explore
the benefits and risks of mood stabilizers and survey other antiseizure and
antipsychotic medications that are often useful in treating mania. Finally, we
examine antidepressants, antianxiety medications, and sedatives.
Grasping the Basics of Bipolar
Psychopharmacology
Psychopharmacology is the use of psychotropic medications (any prescrip-
tion drugs that affect mood, emotion, behavior, or perception) to treat 
mental illness.

In the case of bipolar disorder, psychopharmacology has three primary goals:
 Alleviate acute manic and depressive symptoms, often at the same time
(such as during mixed episodes; see Chapter 2)
 Maintain mood stability
 Treat any additional symptoms, such as anxiety
Meeting all the goals is certainly a tall order, but they seem straightforward
enough, so why do psychiatrists sometimes seem to have such a tough time
prescribing the right medications? Several reasons come to mind:
 Symptoms differ among patients. For one patient, hopelessness and
loss of energy are the biggest problems; for another, racing thoughts and
sleeplessness; and for a third, irritability and loss of interest.
 Patients can have multiple disorders. A patient may have bipolar disor-
der coupled with attention deficit disorder, for example.
 Each medication treats only specific symptoms. Some medications treat
only mania. Others treat only depression. One or two may help prevent or
reduce the chances of experiencing another mood episode in the future.
 Effectiveness varies for each patient. A medication that works for one
patient can have no effect or the opposite effect on another.
 Side effects differ. One patient may feel fine taking a particular medica-
tion, but another may feel groggy or gain weight.
 Medications can worsen symptoms. Some antidepressants can induce
mania or increase anxiety.
 Medications can interact with one another. Treatment often requires
the use of two or more medications at the same time, which can affect
the efficacy of either or both medications.
In this section, we discuss ways to deal with these complications (with the
help of your doctor, of course) and treat your illness the best way possible.
Selecting the best medications for you
Your brain profile is unique, which challenges you and your doctor to dis-
cover the most effective potion — the medication or combination of medica-
tions that works best for you. Discuss medication choices with your doctor.
Just because your boss’s son took Lamictal and is showing improvement
doesn’t mean the medication is right for you; in fact, it may be dangerous for
you. Planning and patience are the keys, but when you’re feeling the pain,
these keys are in short supply. Hang in there, and stay focused and 
committed. Your persistence will eventually pay off.
110
Part III: Opening the Treatment Toolbox: A Comprehensive, Integrated Approach 

Family history may be able to provide you with a shortcut for finding the
right medications for you. If a family member has bipolar disorder and is
responding well to a particular medication or combination, the same medica-
tion(s) may work well for you. This pattern is particularly true for lithium;
researchers have found a strong genetic relationship to “lithium responsive-
ness.” In short, if you have an immediate family member who’s receiving suc-
cessful treatment for bipolar disorder, you can often save time by simply
saying, “I’ll have what he’s having,” or at least by letting your doctor know
what’s working for the other family member.
We encourage you to work closely with your doctor whenever you consider
your treatment options, including medications. If you think a particular med-
ication may be effective, ask your doctor about it. Also, review your medica-
tion choices, and make sure you can answer the following questions before
you start taking any medication:
 Why am I supposed to take this medication?
 What is the medication likely to do?
 What are the side effects? Which ones (such as drowsiness) are likely to
go away after a few weeks?
 What side effects need immediate medical attention, such as a rash,
shortness of breath, or suicidal thoughts?
Managing side effects
As a child, you probably learned not to play with fire the first time you got
burned. Likewise, the first impulse you have when you experience a negative
side effect is to stop taking the medicine you suspect is causing it. In the case
of psychiatric medications, however, stopping treatment can harm you, and
side effects often decrease with time and may be manageable. Your psychia-
trist probably knows some simple tricks, such as the following, for curbing
many common side effects:
 Change the time of day you take the medicine. If a medication makes
you too drowsy, for example, you may be able to take it before bed
rather than first thing in the morning.
 Tweak the dose. A little more or less can make a big difference.
 Add a medication to treat the side effect. If a medication causes trou-
ble, another medication can often help.
 Change the medication. Your psychiatrist may be able to switch you to
a similar medication with fewer side effects.
111
Chapter 7: Touring the Bipolar Pharmacy

Don’t play doctor. Stopping a medication cold turkey or adjusting your med-
ications on your own, especially without informing your psychiatrist, can
lead to mood instability and a host of other problems (such as seizures or
increased anxiety). Always consult your doctor before making any changes.
Also contact your doctor right away if you develop a rash or extreme short-
ness of breath after starting a new medicine — any medication can cause an
allergic reaction.
When starting a new medication, ask your psychiatrist if a free sample is
available. If the medicine doesn’t work or produces undesirable side effects,
at least you don’t lose any money. Another way to save money on medica-
tions that work for you is to order them in bulk; many insurance companies
have pharmacy plans that enable you to order a 90-day supply at a discount.
(See Chapter 20 for more money-saving tips.)
Getting tested for medication levels 
and general health issues
Many medications require regular medical tests to ensure that they meet but
don’t exceed their recommended therapeutic levels (the levels at which they
work) and that they’re not causing any other medical problems. Common
tests include the following:
 Blood levels to test the concentration of the medicine in your blood
 EKGs (electrocardiograms) to monitor heart rhythms
 Thyroid function tests to make sure your thyroid gland is 
working properly
 Liver function tests to ensure that your liver is filtering your 
blood properly
Throughout this chapter, we don’t mention the tests required of a particular
medication unless it has a unique side effect that generates significant con-
cern. Ask your doctor if tests are required for any of the medications you’re
currently taking.
Mixing your pharmaceutical cocktail
The key to finding the right medication or combination of medications is to
remain persistent and in regular communication with your doctor. By provid-
ing detailed feedback on your feelings and behaviors, you can help your
doctor more expertly mix a pharmaceutical “cocktail” that’s both safe and
effective for you. (Chapter 12 features a mood chart designed specifically for
this purpose.)

Practicing safety first
Always make sure that any medication you add is safe to use with any med-
ications you’re already taking. This includes over-the-counter remedies and
“natural” or herbal supplements.
Most prescription medicines include a list of contraindications (medical con-
ditions that preclude the use of a medication) and drug interactions, which
your psychiatrist uses to determine one of the following degrees of safety:
 Dangerous: Some combinations can be toxic. For example, you should
never combine an MAOI (Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor) with an SSRI
(Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor) or lithium with certain antibi-
otics or with the weight-control drug Meridia. We discuss MAOIs and
SSRIs later in this chapter.
 Very risky: Some combinations may be dangerous to some people, but
the potential benefits may outweigh the risks. For example, taking
lithium with some diuretics or older antipsychotics is risky but may
improve symptoms for some individuals.
 Risky: A combination with minimal risk may be reasonable in some 
situations.
 Safe but with possible changes in medication effectiveness: Some med-
ications cause others to become less effective, and some can increase the

Harmonizing Harry
Harry was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in
college when he experienced classic episodes
of depression and mania. His response to lithium
was dramatic — his moods leveled off, and the
cycles disappeared for a while. But Harry was 
a music major — a pianist — and the tremor
from his lithium was unmanageable for him. He
couldn’t prepare or perform during his final
exams, and he began to give up hope of ever
performing his final recital — a requirement for
graduation.
It was clear that lithium wouldn’t work for 
him — at least at the doses he was on. At 
lower doses, he again became depressed, so
Harry’s psychiatrist added a small dose of an 
antidepressant. A hypomanic cycle erupted
quickly, which responded nicely to low doses of
an antipsychotic. Harry tried to get off of his
lithium entirely, but below a certain dose, even
with the other medicines on board, he became
irritable and couldn’t get out of bed. He worked
closely with his psychiatrist to establish a
lithium level that was effective but didn’t cause
a tremor. Along with the other medications, this
plan kept him stable. He completed his exams
and performed his graduation recital — a
semester later than planned but with great suc-
cess. The time and persistence he invested in
his medication trials laid the groundwork for
truly successful management of his symptoms.

effectiveness of your medications. These combinations can sometimes
work to your advantage.
 Safe: Frequently, two medications have a very low risk of negatively
interacting with one another, making them safe to combine.
Consult your doctor if you have any questions concerning the effectiveness
or safety of a medication or combination of medications. Common problems
when mixing medications include one medication decreasing the effectiveness
of another or amplifying its negative side effects, such as increased blood
pressure. Inform your doctor of any medications, supplements, herbs, or nat-
ural remedies you’re currently taking.
Taking a gradual, systematic approach
Few psychotropic medications act as quickly as aspirin. Your doctor may ramp
up the dosage over time to reduce the occurrence of some side effects, and
the medicine may take several weeks to achieve full effectiveness. Furthermore,
whenever you add a medication to your cocktail, you and your doctor need
some time to observe the effects, side effects, and interactions. Under psy-
chological distress, your patience, understandably, may be strained, but fol-
lowing a steady course is critical.
Because so much can change with each medication adjustment, we strongly
recommend that you make changes in only one medicine at a time. Such
patience isn’t always possible — particularly in emergencies — but when the
time is available, a systematic, scientific approach can reduce variables and
make it easier to track down the cause of any side effects. If you introduce two
or more new medications to the mix at the same time and experience a nega-
tive side effect, you may not be able to tell which medication is causing it.
Staying abreast of the changes
Over the course of your life, your brain physiology and chemistry change,
your symptoms change, and your environment and relationships change. To
remain in sync with these changes, check in with your doctor regularly, even
when you’re feeling fine, to determine if you can make any of the following
adjustments:
 Increase or decrease a medication dosage to reduce side effects
 Increase or decrease a medication or change a medication to address a
new or nagging symptom
 Eliminate or reduce a medication to minimize exposure to long-term risks
A common trap is to start taking a combination of medications during a period
of crisis and then continuing on the same medication regimen after you
resolve the crisis. As soon as the crisis is no longer an issue, visit your doctor
to determine if you can scale back or eliminate some of your medications.
Most people with bipolar disorder require some medication throughout their
114
Part III: Opening the Treatment Toolbox: A Comprehensive, Integrated Approach 

lives, but you and your doctor should seize any opportunity to strip away
unnecessary layers of medication.
Juggling medications for 
co-existing conditions
As you weave your way through the brambles of bipolar disorder, you’re
likely to pick up a few burrs — diagnoses of additional, comorbid conditions.
Comorbid is a fancy word for co-existing. In bipolar disorder, psychiatrists use
the term to describe any psychiatric or medical conditions that accompany
your bipolar diagnosis. Of course, the bipolar category already assumes two
co-existing conditions: depression and mania or hypomania. Comorbidity
doesn’t apply to that. It applies to other distinct psychiatric illnesses, such 
as these:
 Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder can co-exist with bipolar 
disorder, sharing symptoms such as hyperactivity and impulsivity.
Amphetamines treat ADHD effectively but can jump-start mania or psy-
chosis in people with bipolar disorder. However, leaping back into a job
or school with untreated ADHD may have failure written all over it.
Certain antidepressants may be effective in treating ADHD, but both
stimulants and antidepressants need to be used with care in treating
bipolar disorder. Cautious use of stimulants may be possible in some 
circumstances, especially in children.
 Anxiety disorders (panic, obsessive compulsive disorder, generalized
anxiety, or social anxiety) show up in about 25 percent (or more) of
people with bipolar disorder. Some medications used for bipolar disor-
der (such as the atypical antipsychotics) can reduce anxiety, but they
may not be adequate, and the anxiety may shut you down and prevent
your return to daily life. SSRI antidepressants effectively reduce anxiety
symptoms in most cases, but you should use them in conjunction with
mood stabilizers, and they require close work with your doctor and sup-
port team.
 Substance abuse, particularly alcoholism, occurs in one third to one half
of people with bipolar disorder. Many medications for bipolar disorder,
including lithium, are dangerous with alcohol. Tranquilizers, such as
valium, are chemically similar to alcohol and create addiction more
easily if you have a tendency toward alcoholism. In combination, alcohol
and tranquilizers can kill you.
 Memory and thinking problems commonly accompany bipolar disor-
der. Adding insult to injury, some of the medications used for bipolar
can cloud your thinking. Work with your doctors to find a medication
combination and dosage level that can stabilize your mood without
mucking up your thought processes.
115
Chapter 7: Touring the Bipolar Pharmacy

 Personality disorders, such as borderline, narcissistic, or obsessive
compulsive, appear to frequently co-exist with bipolar disorder. This lay-
ering of conditions creates a higher likelihood that your function will be
impaired in between mood episodes and complicates your recovery.
Personality disorders typically respond poorly to medications and can
actually work against the medications. Psychotherapy is crucial to man-
aging these issues and must be a part of the treatment package.
Managing your meds during 
and after pregnancy
Women with bipolar disorder who want to have children face daunting chal-
lenges and often express the following concerns:
 How will the medications affect the developing fetus? Many of the
medications used to combat bipolar disorder can be dangerous to the
developing fetus. Even if a medicine doesn’t pose a well-known risk, little
may be known about its safety to the baby’s developing brain and body.
 How will the pregnancy affect my moods? Pregnancy and especially
the postpartum period are high-risk periods for mood instability.
Hormonal shifts create brain changes that can trigger cycles or other
symptoms such as anxiety.
 Can I handle the stress? Pregnancy, delivery, and raising an infant and
child can add to your stress levels, whether you’re a mother- or father-
to-be. The sleep deprivation that comes with a new baby can make
anyone a little cranky, but it can hurl a parent with bipolar disorder right
into a manic episode. When planning a pregnancy, be sure to discuss
these issues with your family.
If you’re a woman with bipolar disorder, and you plan on having a child, work
with your doctor to develop a strategy to facilitate the pregnancy, minimize
the risk to the fetus, and prevent mood cycling. You should also have backup
plans for dealing with any mood episode that occurs during the pregnancy.
Plans can include steps like intensifying your psychotherapy, getting help at
home from friends or relatives, taking a leave of absence from work, or enter-
ing a day treatment program or hospital if necessary. If you unexpectedly
become pregnant while on medication, you, your psychiatrist, and your
OB/GYN should meet and plan the course of action most appropriate for you
and your pregnancy.
You transmit most medications through breast milk, so breastfeeding becomes
another concern. Because postpartum is such a high-risk time for a mood
episode, many women feel more comfortable returning to their medication
and bottle feeding. This is a personal decision you need to make with your
physician.

Unlocking the Bipolar Medicine Cabinet
This section introduces you to many of the most common medications that
treat bipolar disorder. We base our information on the knowledge available
during the writing of this book and on the prescribing practices at the time.
And although we mention the primary benefits and the most common potential
side effects of each medication, we don’t cover all benefits and side effects. If
you want to know why, just try slogging through a pharmacy printout for any
prescription medication you currently take. You can use the information we
provide when consulting with your doctor to determine medications that may
be most effective and safe for treating your symptoms.
Lithium (a.k.a. old faithful)
Successfully treating bipolar disorder since the 1960s, lithium is the grand-
daddy of bipolar medications. Lithium continues to be the gold standard,
treating the range of bipolar symptoms more fully than any other medication
in use today. It treats mania. It treats depression. It can reduce the cycling of
mania and depression. And perhaps most important, it’s the only medication
that’s proven to reduce the risk of suicide in bipolar disorder. Lithium is truly
in a league of its own.
Interestingly, this wonder drug wasn’t cooked up in a multimillion-dollar lab.
Lithium is a naturally occurring salt that just happens to calm the nerves and,
when used under a doctor’s supervision, has mild side effects for most people.
Table 7-1 provides a quick rundown of the potential benefits and some of the
potential side effects of this rock star of bipolar disorder.

Foggy thinking, fatigue, tremor
You must keep lithium blood levels in a very narrow range, so always take the
prescribed dose; your doctor tests the levels every few months (more regu-
larly when you first start taking it) and also orders additional blood and urine
tests. If your lithium level dips below its therapeutic level, the drug isn’t
effective. If it rises too high, the drug can become toxic, and severe lithium
117
Chapter 7: Touring the Bipolar Pharmacy

toxicity can lead to death. Lithium levels can rise as you lose fluid, so be
wary of hot weather and vigorous exercise, and limit your consumption of
diuretics, including coffee and alcohol. If you experience diarrhea, vomiting,
dizziness, lack of coordination, blurred vision, or other signs of lithium toxic-
ity, contact your doctor immediately. If you can’t reach your doctor, head to
the nearest emergency room.
On the Web or at your local health food store, you may hear of a form of
lithium purported to be safer: lithium orotate. The theory behind this claim is
that the chemical compound delivers lithium to the brain more efficiently than
lithium carbonate, the standard compound, so it requires less lithium in your
bloodstream to be effective. However, no studies currently show that lithium
orotate is effective in treating mania or depression. Taking the recommended
dose of lithium orotate probably won’t harm you — but it also won’t help.
Effective antiseizure medicines
Your brain and central nervous system form an intricate power grid carrying
very low-level electricity. With serious central nervous system malfunctions,
such as in epilepsy, neurons misfire to such an extent that they can cause
seizures. Antiseizure medications — including valproate, commonly known
as divalproex (brand name Depakote) — are designed to regulate neuron
firing to prevent seizures. A bonus is that many antiseizure medications also
effectively treat the manic or depressive side of bipolar disorder.
Table 7-2 shows the antiseizure class of medications, in which Depakote is the
golden child, rivaling lithium as the most effective in treating acute mania.
Tegretol (carbemazapine) has also proven effective. Lamictal (lamotrigine) is
growing in popularity because of its effectiveness in preventing depression as
well as reducing the frequency of cycles.

Never stop taking any medication cold turkey, especially an antiseizure med-
ication. Withdrawing an antiseizure medication too quickly can actually
cause seizures. Always consult your doctor before you stop or decrease 
your medication.
Typical atypical antipsychotics
Atypical antipsychotics, sometimes referred to as atypical neuroleptics, are for-
mulated to treat psychosis in schizophrenia, depression, and mania, as well
as in other psychiatric illnesses. The “atypical” moniker stems from the fact
that this newer breed of antipsychotics works a little differently than the
older, standard neuroleptics, such as Thorazine and Haldol. Table 7-3 lists the
most common atypical antipsychotics used to treat bipolar disorder, along
with their primary benefits and potential risks.
Atypical antipsychotics have some typical side effects. Table 7-3 mentions
the most prevalent and risky side effects for each medication, but as a group
they share many (but not all) of the following potential side effects as well:
 Diabetes and problems with sugar metabolism
 Weight gain and increases in cholesterol and other fats
 Movement problems like Parkinson’s disease (tremors and stiffness)
 Irreversible uncontrolled movements called tardive dyskinesia (facial
twitches or uncontrolled movements of the tongue, lips, arms, or other
body parts)
 Akathisia, a feeling of extreme restlessness commonly described as the
overwhelming desire to “jump out of your skin”
 Changes in cardiac rhythms
 Increases in the levels of the hormone prolactin — sometimes causing
breast enlargement in men and lactation or menstrual problems in
women

Mood-boosting antidepressants
Although mania grabs all the headlines, recurrent and severe depressive
episodes can be significantly more devastating and potentially dangerous.
Depressive periods are when bipolar sufferers most often seek treatment,
which often makes antidepressants the first medication prescribed.
Unfortunately, in bipolar sufferers, an antidepressant taken without the pro-
tection of a mood stabilizer can induce mania and worsen the course of the
illness. Because of this, if you (or your doctor) have any suspicions that you
have bipolar depression, strongly consider taking a mood stabilizer first
(preferably one that controls depression as well as mania, such as lithium 
or Lamictal). If the mood stabilizer controls the depression, you’re in luck. If
not, you can add an antidepressant with less concern about inducing mania.
The following sections discuss the various types of antidepressants and the
specific drugs that fall within these groups.
121
Chapter 7: Touring the Bipolar Pharmacy

In addition to their antidepressant qualities, many of these medicines are
effective in treating anxiety, which commonly accompanies both mania and
depression.
SSRIs
SSRIs are Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors. Serotonin is a brain chemi-
cal that helps regulate mood, anxiety, sleep/wake cycles, sexual behaviors,
and many other brain functions. SSRIs increase the level of serotonin in the
synapses in the brain — the spaces between brain cells (neurons) — reducing
symptoms of depression and anxiety in many people. Table 7-4 lists the most
common SSRIs on the market, as well as their potential pros and cons.

SSNRIs
SSNRIs are Selective Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors. They
work by increasing the levels of two brain chemicals — serotonin and norepi-
nephrine — in the synapses between brain cells. Like serotonin (described in
the previous section), norepinephrine is important in regulating mood and
anxiety, along with alertness and concentration. Check out Table 7-5 for a list
of the most common SSNRIs available, along with the potential side effects,
both good and bad, for these medications.

Wellbutrin (bupropion)
Also marketed as Zyban, the antidepressant Wellbutrin appears to work by
increasing the levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain synapses.
It has a completely different mechanism of action from antidepressants in
other classes, such as SSRIs, SSNRIs, and tricyclics; therefore, it belongs in its
own category. Other uses include treating nicotine addiction (as with Zyban)
and possibly treating ADHD. Table 7-6 lists the potential pros and cons for
this popular drug.

Tricyclics and MAO inhibitors
Tricyclics and MAO (monoamine oxidase) inhibitors are older classes of
drugs that work differently from the antidepressants we list previously and
differently from one another. Tricyclics (so called due to a three-ring chemi-
cal structure) affect norepinephrine and serotonin levels primarily, but they
also touch a number of other brain chemicals, such as histamine. These
“extra” chemical events cause many of the side effects of tricyclics. MAO
inhibitors work by preventing the action of an enzyme that breaks down nor-
epinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine, along with a number of related brain
chemicals, resulting in an increase in the levels of these chemicals in the
brain. See Table 7-7 for a comparison of potential risks and benefits.

Calming tranquilizers and sleep agents
Sometimes you can get so revved up with your moods and the medications
you take to stabilize them that you can’t think straight or even fall asleep at a
decent hour. To help, your psychiatrist may prescribe one or more antianxiety
medications (tranquilizers) or sleep aids, which we discuss in this section.
Antianxiety medications
Antianxiety meds (also known as tranquilizers) are central nervous system
depressants — they slow down the whole nervous system. This reduces agi-
tation and anxiety levels, both of which can be problems in bipolar disorder.
They appear to work at the level of a brain chemical called GABA (gamma-
aminobutyric acid), which has a calming effect on neurons. These medica-
tions can also be used as sleep aids when given at night. Table 7-8 lists the
pros and cons of these meds.
124
Part III: Opening the Treatment Toolbox: A Comprehensive, Integrated Approach 
Safely weaning yourself from antidepressants
Doctors used to prescribe antidepressants to
treat acute depression and then recommended
that you stop taking the antidepressant six months
or so after you fully recovered. Some doctors now
prefer a much longer-term use of antidepressants
because of the devastating toll of depression and
its tendency to recur. In any case, if your doctor
recommends that you stop taking your antide-
pressant, do it gradually. Newer studies show that
withdrawing the antidepressant, especially if you
stop cold turkey, can result in a high risk of
relapse. Before you stop taking an antidepressant,
consult your doctor. Follow these steps to gradu-
ally wean yourself from the medication:
1. Seek professional assistance during the
process.
2. Inform your support network of what you
plan to do (see Chapter 6).
3. Obtain therapy for any ongoing depression
triggers.
4. Reduce your intake of the medication by no
more than 10 percent each week over the
course of 10 weeks.
Be aware that some SSRIs and SSNRIs have a
notorious reputation for producing extreme
withdrawal symptoms. Stopping cold turkey
makes you feel quite ill, almost like having the
flu. Don’t stop any medication without speaking
to your doctor first.

Retooling Your Mind 
through Therapy
In This Chapter
 Training your mind to think positively
 Gaining insight into symptoms and solutions
 Tuning in to your circadian rhythms
 Allowing your family on board
T
he right medicines can alleviate bipolar disorder’s most serious symptoms,
but even during periods when you’re symptom free, your functionality —
your ability to work, maintain relationships, and enjoy yourself — may be
impaired. Lost dreams, broken relationships, a ruined career, and the sullen
looks of loved ones can weigh heavy on your emotions. Over time, the pres-
sure can begin to fracture the protective shell of medication, and the vicious
cycle begins anew.
Effectively treating bipolar disorder requires not only medication to balance
the biological components, but also therapy to repair the psychological
aspects (your thoughts and emotions), stressful environmental conditions
(relationships, career, finances, and so on), and behaviors (words and actions
that can cause more problems). By attending to all the contributing factors,
you can work toward slowing and eventually stopping the whirling vortex.
In Chapter 7, we explore commonly used medications for treating the 
biology of bipolar disorder. In this chapter, we turn the focus to psychology,
problem solving, and relationships. We cover the most successful therapies
for addressing psychological disturbances. We reveal how relationship and
family therapy can remove many of the most tenacious stressors. And finally,
we explain ways to hone your problem-solving skills and reduce stress.

Fixing Me: Individual Therapy
The flight attendant on a plane always instructs you before the plane takes
off to put on your oxygen mask before worrying about the person sitting next
to you. If you pass out, you can’t do much to help others. The same is gener-
ally true in therapy: Make yourself feel better and then tackle other issues.
Several individual therapies are available and have shown some degree of
success in treating bipolar symptoms and improving the course of the illness:
 Psychoeducation helps you develop an objective view of your symp-
toms and the need for treatment.
 Cognitive behavioral therapy trains your brain to stop negative thought
patterns and establish positive patterns.
 Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy resets and maintains healthy
circadian rhythms and improves relationships with others.
This section explores each of these therapies and provides exercises and
resources that you can use right now to sample each approach.
Psychotherapy is most effective when your brain is capable and receptive 
to what therapy has to offer. Try to plan your therapy for times when your
moods are relatively stable. If you’re currently experiencing a major mood
episode, seek medical treatment first.
Gaining insight through psychoeducation
Although the diagnosis of any chronic illness is a tough pill to swallow,
accepting the bipolar diagnosis is like trying to swallow an egg. You have 
no blood test to show your friends and family, you have no X-rays, and you
rarely even have a brain scan that suggests you have a bona-fide illness. 
The only symptoms you have are depression, hyperactivity, irritability, and
anger — symptoms that every human being experiences at some time to
some degree. You may wonder, “If my moods and emotions are the result 
of the illness, who am I?” and “If I successfully eliminate the symptoms, 
who will I become?”
Throughout the course of your illness, your ability to accept the fact that you
have bipolar disorder may wax and wane. Your ability to objectively observe
and evaluate your moods and behaviors may improve or worsen. Your desire
to seek treatment may also rise and fall.
128
Part III: Opening the Treatment Toolbox: A Comprehensive, Integrated Approach 

Psychoeducation can improve your treatment outcome by educating you
about bipolar disorder and making you more aware of symptoms and early
warning signs so you can more effectively maintain mood stability. Through
psychoeducation, you take the following positive steps:
 Gain a clearer understanding of bipolar disorder (its causes and 
treatments)
 Understand why medication is necessary
 Find out how therapy can help
 Improve your ability to recognize symptoms
 Become more vigilant of early warning signs
 Gain insight into the stressors and triggers that cause your mood shifts
 Obtain confidence that proper treatment can improve your condition
 Strengthen your resolve to adhere to the recommended treatment plan
You can receive psychoeducation therapy from a variety of sources, includ-
ing the following:
 Books
 Audio recordings
 Video recordings
 Media broadcasts (news, talk shows, and movies about bipolar disorder)
 Doctors, psychiatrists, and therapists
 Support groups
 Group therapy
 Internet sites that provide accurate information (some don’t)
During depressive episodes, insight that something is wrong typically rises;
you’re hypersensitive to the fact that you feel miserable, although insight
about the possibility of improvement declines. During hypomanic and manic
episodes, lack of insight becomes a bigger problem, because increased
energy and self-confidence can conceal the symptoms and convince you that
you don’t need treatment. One of psychoeducation’s prime goals for bipolar
disorder is to improve insight as your mood becomes elevated.

your self-esteem, latches onto self-defeating beliefs, or persuades you that
the future is bleak, you need to hit the emergency OFF button to get your
brain back on the right track.
The trick is in knowing how to find and use the OFF button, because thoughts
are often symptoms of the illness and are created by chemical changes. To
develop new thought and behavior patterns, you need to train your brain,
not just “change your mind.” Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) helps you 
do just that by training you to do the following:
1. Identify distorted thoughts and beliefs.
2. Quiet your brain, and settle down distorted thoughts and beliefs.
3. Develop and practice rational beliefs and logical thought processes.
4. Develop and practice positive and effective behaviors based on the
new thoughts and beliefs.
Psychotherapists have used CBT for years to successfully treat both unipolar
and bipolar depression. Because antidepressants commonly aggravate mania,
CBT serves as an important tool in helping to alleviate depression without the
potentially undesirable side effects of medication. Brain scans have shown
that CBT actually changes the chemical processes in the brain in patients with
unipolar depression — an effect similar to medication. CBT is powerful stuff.
CBT can also help with the manic pole, toning down overly positive, optimistic
beliefs to bring them more in line with reality. During mania, for example, you
may begin to believe that you can easily make a million in the stock market and
completely lose sight of potential risks, such as losing your home.
Treating mania is a more daunting task than treating depression, because in
mania, you don’t see the problem, and for CBT to work, you have to identify 
a problem in order to work on it. But you may be able, through CBT, to cool
down your brain and take a more rational approach with the following steps:
1. Identify your overly optimistic thoughts and perceptions.
2. Quiet your brain, and slow down your thinking.
3. Consider the potential consequences and more realistic possibilities.
4. Develop and practice techniques for controlling your impulses and
choosing safer alternatives.
In sports, you practice your skills well before the big game so that they become
second nature under pressure. For similar reasons, do your CBT work when
your mind is quiet and life is settled — not during a full-blown mood episode —
because the brain has a tough time learning anything new when it’s out of con-
trol. With these new skills firmly in place, when the dust hits the fan, your brain
will be poised to keep itself clear and focused. The time and effort you invest in
practice now pay huge dividends during the hard times.

Identifying distorted thoughts and thinking
Distorted thoughts commonly cloud perception and spark an irrational inter-
nal dialogue that can spiral your mood down into depression or up into
mania. Thinking that any endeavor will lead to failure, for example, can pro-
duce a self-defeating domino effect that results in hopelessness and despair.
On the flip side, thinking that any endeavor will lead to success, no matter
what, can inspire reckless abandon.
Through cognitive therapy, you can identify the distorted thoughts and
thought patterns that permeate your thinking. Table 8-1 lists the most
common distortions, along with examples of how each type can generate
depressive or manic thoughts.

Maladaptive thoughts and thought patterns become so ingrained that you
may not even notice them at work. A cognitive therapist can lead you
through a series of exercises that help you identify the way you perceive,
evaluate, and respond to actual events and conflicts in your life.
Evaluating how you view yourself
Distorted thinking not only rattles your moods and emotions, but also rein-
forces your personal schema — your long-held, overarching beliefs that lead
to negative thought patterns in situations of stress and your total view of
your world and your future.
Personal schemas often become more active during mood shifts. Strong
moods distort your sense of self, and that in turn influences thinking and fur-
ther mangles perception, emotion, and logic. Faulty personal schemas cause
distorted thinking, and in turn the distorted thoughts reinforce the faulty 
personal schemas that they generate. If you go to a party feeling as though
nobody loves you, and then you start wondering if everyone there thinks
you’re a loser, the distorted thought reinforces your personal schema that
nobody loves you. Furthermore, your personal schema has a direct effect 
on how other people respond to you, which in turn reinforces your irrational
beliefs about yourself.
Through cognitive behavioral therapy, you can break the negative cycle and
begin to build a personal schema that’s more in line with who you really are.
132
Part III: Opening the Treatment Toolbox: A Comprehensive, Integrated Approach 

This creates behavior patterns that are more likely to get you what you need
and want and that encourage more positive responses from the world around
you.
Restructuring your behavior
Thought precipitates action or inaction. If you don’t think you can ever have
a fulfilling relationship, you may not have the motivation to try. If you believe
you’re entitled to have everything you want, despite the cost, you may not
hesitate to act, no matter how high the risk. The ultimate goal of CBT is to
change your behavioral responses from self-defeating and negative to pro-
ductive and realistic. This change creates positive experiences that support
positive moods.
Cognitive behavioral therapy goes beyond thought to behavior, or action. In
the case of debilitating depression, CBT attempts to identify the restrictive
thought, question its validity, reveal other possibilities, and encourage you to
take action. Table 8-2 provides some examples of how CBT can work to short-
circuit depressive behaviors.

In the case of unchecked mania, cognitive behavioral therapy attempts to
identify the grandiose thought, question its validity, introduce potential risks,
and encourage safer options. Table 8-3 provides some examples of how CBT
can work to sidestep maladaptive behaviors in mania.

Changing your mindfulness
Quieting irrational thoughts, inserting more logical ones, and developing and
acting on new behavioral plans demands more than just recognizing the pat-
terns. Recognition and insight are critical first steps, and you can’t go on
without them, but the wrinkles of old mental habits rarely fade because of
insight alone. Knowing that eating too much makes you gain weight rarely
keeps a person on a diet. To change behavior, you must fundamentally
change emotions and impulses.
The key technique to invoke these changes involves reducing anxiety. The
brain and body resist change. Change is uncomfortable. To help your brain
and body tolerate changes to your thoughts and behaviors, you need to prac-
tice techniques that calm your brain to keep it from bolting back to the old,
comfortable patterns.
CBT includes many forms of anxiety reduction, including breathing exercises,
meditation, and progressive relaxation techniques. The common feature of
these techniques is mindfulness — the process of focusing your brain on the
moment and experiencing only the moment. Mindfulness clears your brain,
calms your nerves, and allows you to discover new ways of responding 
emotionally and behaviorally. A subtype of CBT called dialectical behavioral
therapy (DBT), developed by Marsha Linehan, uses mindfulness as a core
technique for quieting overpowering emotions and reengaging the logical
part of your brain.
134
Part III: Opening the Treatment Toolbox: A Comprehensive, Integrated Approach 

Be sure to include some form of anxiety reduction and mindfulness training
in your CBT work. Possibilities include
 Breathing exercises
 Visualization techniques
 Progressive muscle relaxation procedures
 Yoga
 Meditation (most any kind)
 Mindfulness exercises (available in DBT skills training groups or through
your therapist or other groups)
A quick mindfulness exercise involves doing an inventory of your five senses.
While you perform a chore, such as folding laundry or pulling weeds, bring
your mind to what you’re experiencing in the world at that moment. What 
do you see? Smell? Hear? Touch? Taste? You may be surprised at what you
hadn’t noticed around you, and in the meantime, you’ve focused your brain
and gotten out of your head and its list of worries, demands, and judgments.
Take a deep breath, and move forward with some new mental energy.
Practicing cognitive behavioral therapy: An exercise
After you understand the principles of CBT, you can begin to use various
techniques to identify distortions and disable them. The following steps 
lead you through a brief exercise that takes you from avoidance to action:
1. Describe a positive activity that you refuse or strongly resist doing
because of how you feel or feel about doing it.
For example, confronting a friend about an issue that needs to be
resolved.
2. Jot down any and all thoughts that may be holding you back, such as
the following:
• “So-and-so always yells at me when I confront her.”
• “I get nervous about confronting people.”
• “Confronting so-and-so never solves anything.”
3. For each negative thought, jot down anything that challenges or
refutes that belief.
For example, if you think, “Confronting so-and-so never solves anything,”
you may come up with the following challenge statements:
• “Just because confrontation hasn’t solved anything in the past
doesn’t mean it can’t solve the issue this time.”
• “So-and-so is a reasonable person who may be convinced this
time.”
135
Chapter 8: Retooling Your Mind through Therapy

• “By confronting other people in the past, I’ve been able to resolve
some issues.”
4. Jot down possible benefits that may result from taking action, such as
the following:
• “We can resolve our differences and become closer.”
• “So-and-so may respect me more for standing up for myself.”
• “After the confrontation, I can move beyond the issue one way or
another.”
5. In your mind, rehearse various scenarios of how the action will 
play out.
Try to invent a scenario in which you approach the situation in a way
that’s comfortable for you. Use your relaxation techniques to calm the
anxiety that arises when you imagine the scenario. Imagine yourself
relaxing and focusing when you perform the action in real life.
6. Write down a plan for proceeding with the action, including a date
and time and what anxiety reduction techniques you can use at that
time.
7. When the day arrives, perform the action as you planned.
8. Don’t be frustrated or angry at yourself if it doesn’t go as planned.
This takes practice.
The example exercise represents only one way of approaching a problematic
thought distortion. Approaches vary, depending on the distortion and how it
works in a particular instance. A qualified therapist can recommend several
techniques for identifying and ridding your mind of distorted thoughts,
including the following:
 Journaling to monitor distorted thoughts and identify how they can
possibly affect your behavior
 Envisioning how an action or event will unfold so you can become com-
fortable with it
 Challenging, in which the therapist acts as a devil’s advocate, arguing
on the side of your distorted belief, and you voice challenges to refute
its truth
 Role playing to enable you to act out an uncomfortable scenario with
your therapist before you try it out in the real world
 Experimenting with different options that you discuss in therapy
 Desensitizing, in which you slowly work toward performing an action
that you’re uncomfortable doing (this is more of a behavior-modification
tool)
 Acting “as if,” when you perform the role of someone acting out the new
behavior, even if it doesn’t feel real or genuine yet

Resetting your circadian clock through
interpersonal and social rhythm therapy
The world has a rhythm to it: the tick-tock of the clock, sunrise/sunset, the
phases of the moon, the ebb and flow of tides, the work week, seasonal shifts,
paydays, showtimes in TV Guide. You subconsciously move to the rhythms
around you, and as long as they remain relatively in tune with healthy rou-
tines, you do just fine. But when an event throws off your natural rhythm,
your moods can shift out of their normal orbit.
Bipolar sufferers commonly find solace in a structured routine. Routine
calms. It orders the chaos. It removes unpleasant surprises. It simplifies 
planning. And it helps you get a good night’s sleep, night after night. (Sleep
deprivation is a known trigger for mania.) Unfortunately, keeping a routine
can be a drag, especially when you’re a little manic, which is when you need
your routine’s calming effects most.

Chapter 8: Retooling Your Mind through Therapy
Building a balanced perspective
JoAnn was a middle-aged piano teacher, diag-
nosed with bipolar disorder later in life. Her
depressive times spilled over into her life even
between episodes, and she constantly berated
herself for her many perceived failures. She
avoided many activities and opportunities
because she felt so incompetent. As she worked
on identifying her negative thoughts, she was
astounded at how often she judged and criticized
herself — it seemed like every moment of every
day. It didn’t help that due to her illness and not
receiving a diagnosis for so long, other people
had reinforced her negative self-image by judg-
ing and criticizing her openly.
As a piano teacher, she often viewed things in
terms of her left hand and her right hand — the
two parts of any piano composition. She gradu-
ally began to think of her negative “laundry list”
as weighing down her left hand, and she started
to build a new laundry list of achievements and
positives on her right hand to balance her
thoughts. She tapped on her right hand with each
positive thought, reinforcing it with a physical
touch along with her visual image of the two
hands. She could perform this ritual quietly, even
while teaching lessons, to help her stay focused
and to prevent herself from getting lost in nega-
tive thoughts. Her right-hand list included bring-
ing music into the lives of hundreds of children,
achieving a successful marriage in spite of all her
difficulties, and expanding her own love of music
and sound.
JoAnn’s confidence improved, and she took on
new challenges in her teaching — including
music therapy for children with emotional diffi-
culties. She began to view herself in a more pos-
itive light and always kept tapping her right hand.

Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (IPSRT) can superimpose structured
routine onto your life, providing you with a stable framework to support your
life and anchor your moods. Its goal is to reduce the frequency of mood
episodes by balancing the stimulation and rest cycles of your day-to-day life
and resolving interpersonal problems. Therapy typically follows a four-stage
process: initial, intermediate, maintenance, and termination.
Surveying the IPSRT process
Here’s a breakdown of IPSRT’s four-stage process:
 Initial: In this phase, you and your therapist develop a detailed history of
your disorder, identifying significant mood episodes and their severity,
and any life events, medications, or work history that may have coincided
with each episode. The therapist helps you develop an interpersonal
inventory, highlighting important people and the roles they play in your
life, and assists you in identifying interpersonal problem areas that you
need to address. During the initial phase, the therapist also provides psy-
choeducation about the disorder.
 Intermediate: In this phase, the therapist helps you identify your rhythms
and create a more structured daily schedule. You also begin to address
interpersonal problems that may be affecting your moods.
 Maintenance: Maintaining routines in the midst of discord can be quite
a challenge. This phase, which can last for several years, helps you iden-
tify events and anticipate and resolve conflicts that threaten your
rhythm and routines.
 Termination: When you no longer need your therapist’s help to main-
tain your rhythm and routines, the therapist leads you through a termi-
nation phase, essentially weaning you from therapy.

Marching to the beat of your zeitgebers
Your moods, emotions, and behaviors tend to
follow a pattern over a 24-hour period (give 
or take an hour); scientists refer to this pattern
as your circadian rhythm. To keep your rhythm
relatively stable, your body looks for environ-
mental cues, called zeitgebers (German for “time
givers”). Back in the good old days, and even
today in some rural communities, the main zeit-
gebers were the rising and setting of the sun. In
modern, industrial societies, individuals and
communities establish their own zeitgebers. Your
morning wake-up call, meal times, exercise
schedule, and even your daily television shows
function as zeitgebers.
Because you largely control where they occur,
your zeitgebers are much more prone to fluctu-
ations than the rising and setting of the sun, and
they often vary from one day to the next, making
it much more difficult to establish a consistent
rhythm from one day to the next. IPSRT helps
you establish consistent zeitgebers and retain a
daily rhythm.

Identifying your natural rhythm
An ideal situation would involve everyone tuning in to the rhythm of the
rising and setting sun. Keeping a farmer’s schedule would ensure optimum
exposure to the mood-brightening sun, sufficient and regular sleep, and very
little variation in schedules. But even with such a natural external rhythm,
people all have their own biological tendencies and cycles. Morning people
(the larks) feel most energized in the early hours and get sleepy in the early
evening. Night people (the owls) just get started as the sun goes down.
Balancing your rhythms with the world’s demands can be tricky.
The first step in moving toward a more predictable and stabilizing schedule
is to determine your current schedule and preferences. Figure 8-1 provides a
daily grid you can fill out to record your activities for a representative week.
For each day, log your activities from the time you wake up until the time you
go to bed, including meals, work, social activities, family time, exercises,
naps, and any other activities.
Structuring your daily routine
IPSRT doesn’t attempt to burden you with a lockstep schedule you must
adhere to. Instead, it helps you identify your most out-of-sync patterns and
work toward changing your schedule so that it follows a regular pattern from
one day to the next. For example, if you go to bed at 10:30 every night except
Friday, when you stay out until 3 a.m., IPSRT attempts to bring your Friday
bedtime more in line with your normal bedtime.
After completing a weekly schedule, examine it for the most dramatic varia-
tions in your daily schedule, and draw up a new schedule that has less varia-
tion. Don’t make drastic changes that you can’t possibly tolerate. Go slow.
You can make additional adjustments later. Part of IPSRT calls for formulating
goals and expectations for change. When your expectations are realistic, you
leave less room for frustration, which itself can trigger mood problems.
Regulating your interpersonal and social rhythms
IPSRT also seeks to normalize rhythms in your relationships and social life.
Studies show that relationship discord can significantly affect rhythms and
daily routines, in addition to whipping your emotions into a frenzy. If you’ve
ever had a big fight with a loved one just before bedtime, you know how the
emotional stress and anger can disturb your sleep–wake cycle.
By tracking the amount of time you spend in high-intensity and low-intensity
contact with family members and friends, you can often identify problem
areas and begin to develop healthy relationships that keep your routines and
emotions on an even keel.

If relationship issues cause a great deal of stress in your life, resolve the
issues as soon as possible. Relationship counselors can help you and your
loved ones develop more effective communication and problem-solving skills
that can help not only with the current situation, but also with any future sit-
uations you may encounter.
Maintaining your rhythm in the midst of discord
You’re finally in tune with the magical rhythms of the universe, and then you
get the big one-two punch: Thanksgiving (ugh!) and Christmas (UGH!). In a
matter of days, scheduling changes, crowded shopping malls, and your dys-
functional relatives trash your well-tuned circadian rhythm.
Therapists who specialize in IPSRT know that these events happen. Your kid’s
swim season starts, a temporary job you enjoyed ends, a close relative falls
ill . . . you name it. Through therapy, you can practice techniques that help
you anticipate such events and curb the effects of any unforeseen incidents.
The following list provides some suggestions:
 Plan ahead for holidays. Don’t let your family dictate the routines you
follow. Someone else’s rhythms may not coincide with yours.
 Plan your weekends. Unplanned weekends can leave you with nothing
to do, which can be depressing, or leave you open to unrestrained spon-
taneity, which may lead to manic impulsivity.
 Seek immediate treatment for any physical ailments. Coughs, colds,
night sweats, incontinence, and other illnesses can really foul up your
sleep–wake schedule and other routines. See your doctor.
 Resolve conflicts immediately. Allowing conflicts and relationship
issues to fester builds tension, which eventually finds some way to
express itself. Seek counseling, if necessary.
 Establish a 30-minute quiet time before bed. No arguments and no
exciting television shows or video games — in other words, nothing that
may interfere with your sleep.
 Outlaw arguments at dinnertime. You can schedule a later meeting to
deal with any issues that you need to address. This doesn’t mean that
you should stare silently at your plate — just avoid big blow-ups at the
dinner table.
 Provide sufficient time to get ready for work. Keep your mornings as
stress-free as possible.
 Provide sufficient time at the end of your workday to unwind. Having
a smooth transition between work time and your time (or family time)
can reduce stress.

Fixing Us: Relationship 
and Family Therapy
Few people consider blaming the house when a tornado blows it apart, but
when a person suffers a mental breakdown, people direct all their attention
to fixing that person so it doesn’t happen again. The patient’s family dynamic,
career, and finances may be swirling out of control and picking up speed, but
no matter; as long as the doctors can patch up the patient, she should be
able to withstand the tempest.
You may have an inherent vulnerability to bipolar disorder, but stress is often
the catalyst for the reaction that produces the symptoms. Some stress may
come from within, as in the case of distorted thoughts and beliefs (see the
previous section “Fixing Me: Individual Therapy”), but stress can also come
from dysfunctional family dynamics, relationship conflicts, your job, and
other external sources. Furthermore, the disorder itself frequently triggers
stressful life events and losses. People with bipolar disorder are most in need
of reducing life stress, yet by definition they have more than their share
because of the illness. Breaking the cycle at some point is a part of managing
the illness and preventing recurrence.
In most cases, you can’t reduce external sources of stress on your own —
you need the cooperation and commitment of others, especially your loved
142
Part III: Opening the Treatment Toolbox: A Comprehensive, Integrated Approach 
Benefiting from IOT and RTCs
Many hospitals and mental health clinics offer
intensive outpatient therapy (IOT), which typi-
cally consists of a half day or full day of therapy
at the hospital or clinic. During IOT, the psychia-
trist on staff typically meets with you to discuss
your medication regiment. You also spend time
one on one with a therapist, who may offer tech-
niques from various therapeutic approaches,
including cognitive behavioral therapy and inter-
personal and social rhythm therapy. IOT often
includes group therapy as well. One of IOT’s main
benefits is that it removes you from your daily
surroundings, which can be quite stressful, and
places you in an environment where you can
focus on your mental well-being.
Resident programs, often referred to as resident
treatment centers (RTCs), offer similar advan-
tages, plus an alternative living arrangement.
Such an arrangement is especially useful for
providing long-term care for people who can’t
care for themselves and can’t rely on family and
friends for support. In addition to monitoring
medications and providing psychotherapy, a
resident program typically offers occupational
therapy or job placement services and works
closely with your employer to ensure success.

ones. Through relationship and family therapy, you and your loved ones can
reap the following benefits:
 Relief: Bipolar disorder can make everyone in the family feel as though
they’re walking on eggshells and wondering whose fault it is. Knowing
that the disorder has caused at least some of these problems is often
very comforting to family and friends.
 Empowerment: Knowledge not only empowers all those involved, but
also reduces the fear of the unknown and alleviates anxiety about the
future.
 Improved communication skills: You and your loved ones can team up
to establish a healthy emotional ambience that benefits all involved.
 Personal development: Appreciating the unique gifts of a loved one and
working together to overcome the challenges of bipolar disorder can
deepen relationships and build character.
Repairing rocky relationships
You can run out to your local bookstore and fill a shopping cart full of books
about relationship issues and ways to fix your marriage. To discover some
very useful skills, check out Relationships For Dummies, by Dr. Kate M. Wachs,
or Making Marriage Work For Dummies, by Dr. Steven Simring and Dr. Sue
Klavans Simring. When you’re in a committed relationship with someone who
has bipolar disorder, you need all the expert advice in those books and then
some.
In particular, you need a therapist who has experience working with bipolar
disorder in committed relationships. Such therapists offer the following 
benefits:
 Ability to recognize signs and symptoms: An experienced therapist can
tell when someone is overly confrontational due to mania or hypomania.
During such times, therapy can be counterproductive, so the therapist
may recommend that you postpone relationship therapy and seek indi-
vidual treatment until your mood episode subsides.
 Knowledge of common problems that arise in relationships due to bipo-
lar disorder: You want a therapist who’s aware of the toll that depression
and mania can have on a relationship. A therapist who knows common
problems that can result from the impulsiveness of mania, for example —
including unchecked spending, sexual promiscuity, and risky business
ventures — can often provide suggestions for reducing the risks.
143
Chapter 8: Retooling Your Mind through Therapy

 Awareness of how bipolar disorder affects family dynamics: Bipolar
disorder commonly runs in families, so other relationships outside of
your relationship as a couple may affect and be affected by your rela-
tionship. A therapist who has experience with bipolar disorder can 
identify and help you address these peripheral problems.
 Knowledge of how other couples in similar situations have success-
fully dealt with issues: An experienced therapist has a deeper well from
which to draw advice.
Attempting to solve relationship disputes when either or both of you are
manic or depressed can make problems worse. In moments of mood instabil-
ity, you’re much more likely to be confrontational and defensive. Obtain indi-
vidual treatment first and then work on repairing your relationship rifts.
If you and your partner experience occasional turmoil that you resolve within
a few days, you’re experiencing perfectly normal and even healthy relation-
ship issues. However, if a particular issue continues to nag you or your part-
ner or remains buried, festering a low-level chronic anger, you need to deal
with it — the sooner, the better. You have two choices: Resolve the issue, or
let it go. By “let it go,” we don’t mean bury it; make a conscious decision that
it doesn’t matter to either of you and will never again cause conflict.
Making bipolar disorder a family affair
A deep depression can draw the curtains on an entire household, stifling joy
and affection. Mania can whip the same family into a frenzy of activity and
enthusiasm, make everyone cower in fear, or transform a peaceful meal into 
a melee. When family members don’t know what’s going on, they may turn 
on one another in a vicious blame game that drives them further from any
solution.
If bipolar disorder disrupts your family, any reaction is perfectly understand-
able. Everyone is geared to respond a certain way when symptoms of mania
and depression generate turmoil. Sometimes your response is merely a self-
defense mechanism to preserve your mental and emotional health. However,
after your loved one receives a diagnosis, you can begin the process of
acceptance, understanding, and recovery, and join forces as a family to 
prevent the disorder from ruling your lives.
Family therapy is very effective both in helping family members cope and in
improving the prognosis for the person who has bipolar disorder. Therapy
that includes the following components can help a family look forward to
acquiring the knowledge and skills it needs to support one another:
 Psychoeducation initially focuses on assisting family members to come
to terms with bipolar disorder, especially the most recent mood episode.
As a family member, you reinforce that the illness is physical and that no
144
Part III: Opening the Treatment Toolbox: A Comprehensive, Integrated Approach 

one is to blame for its onset. Therapy fosters empathy and increases
understanding of why the person with the disorder may resist treatment
and intervention. You also find out what you can do to help and what to
do in the event of a relapse.
 Communication enhancement assists family members in developing
effective communication styles. Sessions typically involve some role-
playing, in which you practice becoming a more active listener and
phrasing your statements and requests in nonconfrontational language.
Communication is the key to toning down the family dynamic and elimi-
nating as many stressors as possible.
 Regulating emotional intensity helps keep emotional expressions in a
healthy range. Family members tend to follow emotional patterns when
expressing themselves. Loud and highly expressive styles can be enter-
taining and fun, but in a family with bipolar disorder, this style can be a
powerful trigger for mood cycles. On the other hand, too much quiet
and an inability to express appropriate feelings can yield emotional melt-
downs. Chapter 16 discusses the importance of reducing the level of
expressed emotion, a particularly harmful type of emotion.
 Problem solving encourages family members to identify problems and
develop solutions instead of taking less effective measures, such as
avoidance, blaming others or yourself, or trying to solve the problem
entirely on your own and feeling bitter about it later.
Remaining cool when bipolar disorder turns up the heat can be quite a chal-
lenge. When experiencing a manic or mixed episode, a person may get right 
in your face and unleash a litany of caustic remarks and insults. Your first
impulse may be to lash back at the person, but a negative reaction is like 
pouring kerosene on a blaze that’s already out of control. Try your best to
defuse the incident before it gets out of hand, and then do what you can 
to assist your loved one later. Chapter 16 provides additional advice and
strategies.
Developing problem-solving skills
A knack for solving difficult problems reduces conflict in any family or close
relationship, but problem solving is even more critical when bipolar disorder is
involved. Mania and depression can team up to create insurmountable prob-
lems; mania creates the problem, depression magnifies it, and vice versa. And
in addition to the normal issues people face, such as financial fiascos and time
and household management, bipolar disorder introduces areas of potential 
disagreement:
 Treatment management: Which treatment option is best? Is the person
receiving treatment adhering to the treatment plan? Are the medications
working? When will things be back to normal? All these questions and
more can generate anxiety and confusion, which can lead to conflict.
145
Chapter 8: Retooling Your Mind through Therapy

 Work options: When one person can’t work, the burden of meeting
financial needs falls on others. In addition, the decision of whether and
when to return to work can cause tension.
 Household responsibilities: A serious illness always shifts household
responsibilities to others in the family and shakes up the normal family
dynamic. Problem-solving skills can help smooth the transitions.
Problem-solving skills focus on identifying problems that may seem insur-
mountable and then breaking them down into small, manageable units or
steps, which you can then perform methodically. When you face such a 
problem, sit down as a couple or a family, and take the following steps to
solve the problem:
1. Identify the problem, and state it in one or two sentences.
2. Brainstorm potential solutions.
Don’t evaluate solutions at this point; just throw everything down on 
a page.
3. Pick the top solutions, based on which ones seem most realistic, most
effective, and most do-able.
4. Brainstorm the benefits and drawbacks of each remaining solution.
5. Pick the best solution, or combine different ones to form an even
better solution.
6. Draw up a plan made up of small steps.
7. Execute the plan to the best of your abilities.
8. Adjust the plan as needed to improve its effectiveness.
When plans meet reality, reality often wins. A common mistake is to stick
with a well-laid plan even when it fails to produce the desired results. If the
plan fails, ditch it, cut your losses, and try something new. Don’t be surprised
if you need to problem solve three or four times before you discover an effec-
tive solution.

 Jolting your moods with ECT
 Developing a more attractive mood with rTMS
 Brightening your moods with light therapy
T
he one-two punch of psychiatric medication and psychotherapy knocks
out the worst symptoms of bipolar disorder for most people. But in some
cases, medication proves ineffective, or it produces side effects that make 
the cure seem worse than the curse. In other cases, especially for pregnant
women, the potential risks of medicine outweigh the benefits. The person
with bipolar disorder may be so resistant to taking the required medication,
for whatever reason, that doctors must consider other treatment options.
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and light therapy are proven medical treat-
ments that doctors use less frequently than medication and psychotherapy,
but they have an important place in the bipolar toolbox. Herbal remedies and
vitamin supplements also appeal to some patients. Anecdotal evidence and a
few studies suggest that some herbs, vitamins, and other supplements may
be somewhat useful, especially when used in conjunction with standard 
medications and therapy. Other studies show that the same treatments are
completely useless or even dangerous.
Who’s right? Who’s wrong? How dangerous can an herb possibly be? Is St.
John’s wort as effective as my neighbor claims it is? Can I improve my mood
in a tanning booth? Will electroconvulsive therapy grill my gray matter? 
This chapter sets out to answer all these questions and more.

Assessing the Risk-to-Benefit Ratio 
of Alternative Treatments
All treatments have a risk-to-benefit ratio that pits potential risks against poten-
tial benefits. We qualify our statements with the word “potential,” because the
risks and benefits vary in each case. One person may respond very favorably
to lithium, but another may not respond at all. Lithium may cause weight gain
and thyroid problems in one person and cause no negative side effects in
another. The same is true of other treatments.
As a consumer, you work along with your doctor to evaluate the risk-to-
benefit ratio for various treatment options. You and your doctor may want 
to consider alternative treatment options for any of the following reasons:
 Nothing else works. Sometimes, you have no choice; standard treat-
ments have proved ineffective for you, so an alternative treatment is
worth a try.
 You can’t tolerate the side effects of any other drugs on the menu. If
you can’t handle the side effects of any of the prescription medications
that your doctor recommends, an alternative treatment may help allevi-
ate symptoms without causing dramatic side effects.
 You want a second opinion from a different perspective. A food allergy
or nutrient deficiency that the standard battery of lab tests didn’t exam-
ine may contribute to your mood swings. Approaching bipolar disorder
from a different perspective may reveal other treatment options.
 You’re pregnant and concerned that prescription medication may be
dangerous for the fetus. If you become pregnant while being treated for
depression or mania, your OB/GYN and psychiatrist need to discuss
your treatment options together and with you. Especially in the first
trimester, optional treatments may be able to alleviate symptoms with
less potential risk to the fetus.
 Your current treatment regimen isn’t working well enough. The 
addition of a dietary supplement may increase the effectiveness of a 
prescription medication.
Psychiatrists refer to any treatment or therapy intended to increase the effec-
tiveness of your primary medications as complementary or adjunctive —
fancy words for “add-on.” For Bipolar I (see Chapter 2), psychotherapy is
considered adjunctive treatment, but medicines or substances that increase
the effectiveness of the main medications are also considered adjunctive or
complementary.
148

Feeding Your Moods All-Natural
Ingredients
Sometimes a home remedy, an herbal concoction, or a handful of dietary sup-
plements can help lift depression and calm mania. Doctors and scientists are
constantly on the lookout for the root cause of various illnesses, and occa-
sionally they hit on something in nature that shows promise. After all, lithium
is a naturally occurring element with a long history of stabilizing moods.
This section explores the pros and cons of some of the more promising 
“natural” treatments for depression and mania and lists some of their 
potential risks and side effects.
Assessing the safety of all-natural 
ingredients
People often think that vitamins and herbs are “worth a try.” If you can get
them at the store without a prescription, they must be safe, right? Well, not
exactly. These so-called nutraceuticals carry their own potential risks and
drawbacks, such as the following:
 Unconventional treatments may cause you to forgo more effective
treatments. The most serious risk associated with trying alternative
remedies is that they may keep you from obtaining the best treatments
currently available. Always consult your doctor before you try an alter-
native treatment.
 Unconventional treatments may not be cost effective. If you’ve ever
been to a holistic healer, you know that you can walk out with an arm-
load of remedies and supplements that cost hundreds of dollars. A pre-
scription for lithium or a generic mood medication may actually be less
expensive and much more effective.
 Insurance may not cover unconventional treatments. If you load up
your cart at the local health food store with megavitamins, nutritional
supplements, and herbal remedies, your insurance company is unlikely
to foot the bill.
 Unconventional treatments can require high maintenance. Some 
treatments require you to perform extensive colon-cleansing and liver-
cleansing routines and then take high doses of dietary supplements and
herbal mixtures. If you have trouble remembering to take your medica-
tion three times a day, unconventional treatments may pose an even
more daunting challenge.
149
Chapter 9: Expanding Your Treatment Options

Even worse, drastic body-cleansing routines can raise the concentra-
tions of some medications, particularly lithium, to dangerous and poten-
tially lethal levels.
 Unconventional treatments have negative side effects, too. “Natural”
substances work by changing your brain chemistry in much the same
way that prescription medications do. Although some natural sub-
stances may be safer than prescription medicines, they may not be 
completely safe, and some can be downright dangerous.
 Unconventional treatments are less strictly regulated. The Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) regulates the manufacture and distribution 
of prescription medications, ensuring that they meet quality standards.
The FDA is less involved in regulating dietary supplements and herbs, 
so in many cases, you may not really know what you’re taking.
 Your doctor may not be well versed in unconventional treatments.
Most physicians and psychiatrists invest their time and research treat-
ing their patients with the most effective and harmless medications rec-
ommended by the medical establishment. They often have little
expertise with less mainstream approaches.
Don’t assume that your doctor is ignorant or averse to trying alternative
treatments. Most doctors know something about them, are quite willing to
discuss them with you, and can help guide you in making an informed and
safe decision.
Fishing for a cure with 
omega-3 fatty acids
You may think that people subjected to a life of gnawing on whale blubber
would be a little glum, but evidence proves otherwise. Studies have shown
that in countries such as Finland and Iceland, where fish is a huge part of the
national diet, the rates of depression are lower than in the United States and
other parts of Europe. This fact led scientists to hypothesize that something
in the diet makes the brain less susceptible to depression. What they discov-
ered were omega-3 fatty acids — essential fatty acids (EFAs) found in fish and
other foods — that show promise in preventing heart disease and in treating
depression and autoimmune diseases.
One relatively limited study has shown that high levels of omega-3 (2 to 7
grams daily) can help prevent recurrence of mania and depression. Larger,
more recent studies report that omega-3 doesn’t reduce mania or mood
cycling, but that in some cases, high doses of omega-3 fatty acids can
improve the effectiveness of antidepressants.
150
Part III: Opening the Treatment Toolbox: A Comprehensive, Integrated Approach 

Omega-3 is no replacement for your mood stabilizer or antidepressant, espe-
cially if you’re treating extreme mood episodes, so don’t flush your meds just
yet. However, if you like anchovies, ordering them on your next pizza can’t
hurt, and in the long run, some extra omega-3 in your diet may help.
You can obtain omega-3 fatty acids from any of the following sources:
 Cold-water fish (including salmon, mackerel, herring, tuna, anchovies,
and sardines)
 Wild animals (including deer, buffalo, and free-range chickens)
 Omega-3 enhanced eggs
 Dark green leafy vegetables (such as purslane)
 Flaxseed oil
 Walnuts
 Omega-3 supplements
Don’t start eating three servings of fish a day so you can be health-smart.
Some farm-raised fish are very low in omega-3, and wild fish can have high
levels of mercury, which is hazardous to your health. Manufacturers typically
filter out the mercury when processing their omega-3 supplements so you
can obtain high levels of the essential fatty acids with fewer potential risks.
Unless you literally chew the fat with Eskimos, getting 2 or more grams of EFAs
daily through your diet is tough, so you probably need to take supplements.
Unfortunately, the FDA doesn’t control omega-3 supplements, so check the
label to make sure the supplement meets the following requirements:
 Highly concentrated in omega-3. Obviously, if you have a choice
between a supplement with 30 percent omega-3 or 70 percent, pick the
one with 70 percent.
 High purity rating. The label may not contain this information, but look
for a product that’s known to be pure. Filtering out mercury and other
contaminants is important, both in terms of safety and effectiveness.
 Less fishy aftertaste. You may not want to keep popping omega-3 tablets
if they make your tongue taste like a rancid sardine.
Many omega-3 supplements are derived from fish and can leave an unpleas-
ant aftertaste, which many people find . . . well, distasteful. Buy small quanti-
ties of various brands to try before you purchase any in bulk. For more
information about omega-3, including a selection of recipes, check out The
Omega-3 Connection (Free Press), by Andrew L. Stoll, MD.

Chapter 9: Expanding Your Treatment Options

Pumping up your brain with 
vitamins and minerals
Insufficient amounts of vitamin C can cause scurvy. Too little iron can result in
fatigue. A vitamin D deficiency can weaken your teeth and bones. Obviously,
vitamins and minerals can have a significant impact on your overall health,
but when the brain starts to malfunction, few people look to vitamins and 
minerals for answers.
In some ways, overlooking vitamins and minerals is understandable, espe-
cially in Western countries, where food is plentiful and enriched. In these
countries, true vitamin and mineral deficiencies are rare, but low levels of
these nutrients, even when the levels are not low enough to qualify as a defi-
ciency, may be related to some depressive symptoms. Although we wouldn’t
suggest that any vitamin or combination of vitamins is effective for treating
depression or mania, several vitamins and minerals can have a significant
effect on brain development and function, including the following:
 B complex: B-complex vitamins consist of B1 (thiamine), B2 (riboflavin),
B3 (niacin), B5 (pantothenic acid), B6 (pyridoxine), B7 (biotin), B12
(cobalamin), and folic acid (folate or folacin). Your body uses the 
B-complex vitamins to build cells, especially nerve cells. Taking 
them together in the appropriate relative concentrations is important,
because too much of one can cause a deficiency of another.
 B1 (thiamine): Thiamine deficiencies have been known to cause fatigue,
irritability, anxiety, insomnia, and loss of appetite. People who drink a
lot of alcohol are susceptible to this deficiency. Your doctor may recom-
mend additional thiamine on top of a B-complex supplement.
 B6: True B6 deficiency is rare, but older people, alcoholics, women
taking birth control pills, people with poor diets, or children on the
asthma medication theophylline are at risk of low B6 levels. B6 can be
dangerous in high doses, especially when taken alone (as opposed to
taking it as part of a B-complex supplement), so don’t increase your
intake of B6 beyond a traditional supplement unless prescribed by a
physician.
 B12: A B12 deficiency is also rare, but strict vegetarians, older adults,
people with certain stomach and intestinal illnesses, and people on cer-
tain medications, including those used to treat acid reflux and peptic
ulcers, are at risk. The diabetes medication metformin (Glucophage) can
also reduce B12 levels.
 C: Researchers continue to explore the link between vitamin C and a
number of illnesses, including the common cold, heart disease, and
cancer. How vitamin C relates to mood disorders is unknown, but some
researchers suspect that it may play a contributing role.
152
Part III: Opening the Treatment Toolbox: A Comprehensive, Integrated Approach 

 E: Some healers have touted vitamin E as a cure for everything from
heart disease and cancer to depression, but large recent studies call
these connections into question. True deficiencies are rare, and vitamin
E may actually cause medical problems at high doses, so always consult
your doctor.
 Folic acid: Folic acid is critical in the development of the human ner-
vous system, so pregnant women must take folic acid supplements.
People who abuse alcohol and people with certain illnesses who must
take particular medications are at risk for folate deficiencies. Some
research has connected low folate levels to depression, so checking
levels and supplementing with folic acid may be part of treatment for
depression, particularly in people in these high-risk categories.
 Magnesium: A magnesium deficiency is rare, but high-risk groups include
older adults, people who abuse alcohol, diabetics, and people with a
number of other medical conditions that require a variety of medications.
Low body stores of magnesium may be related to a number of health
problems, including mood regulation.
 Calcium: Like magnesium, calcium is a mineral that plays an important
role in the formation of strong bones and teeth and in regulating the 
circulatory and nervous systems. Calcium is often combined with 
magnesium in supplements to improve the absorption of magnesium.
Supplementation is often necessary for women, vegetarians, and people
with lactose insufficiency.
 Zinc: Some clinical studies suggest that low levels of zinc may con-
tribute to depression, but a well-balanced diet typically provides enough
zinc. People who abuse alcohol and patients with chronic stomach prob-
lems that include diarrhea are at risk of zinc deficiency.
Your body can usually dispose of excess water-soluble vitamins, including
vitamin C. Fat-soluble vitamins, including E and K, however, can build up 
in your system to toxic levels. Always consult your doctor before taking 
supplements, including vitamins and minerals.
Going herbal with St. John’s 
wort and other supplements
Wouldn’t it be great if you could cure bipolar disorder with something grow-
ing wild in your backyard? Maybe you could brew a batch of dandelion tea or
eat a bowl of berries from that bush you’re constantly trimming back. Nature
provides a host of effective cures and treatments for common ailments, but
does it serve up anything for bipolar disorder? Some people believe so, and
153
Chapter 9: Expanding Your Treatment Options

they point to the following herbs and supplements as examples that support
the claim:
 St. John’s wort: Some limited studies, mostly performed in Germany,
suggest that St. John’s wort (a medicinal herb) is effective in treating
mild to moderate unipolar depression. A relatively recent, extensive
study performed in the United States, however, suggests that St. John’s
wort is about as effective in treating major depression as a lemon drop.
Some doctors continue to recommend it, and some people with depres-
sion continue to sing its praises. Be careful, though; like most antide-
pressants, St. John’s wort carries the risk of inducing mania. It can also
interact with a number of drugs, so, as always, consult your doctor first.
 Ginkgo biloba: Some sound research supports the use of gingko biloba
(a medicinal herb) in the treatment of dementia, including Alzheimer’s
disease. Its use in mood disorders isn’t well established, but its effective-
ness is being explored. At high doses, it can thin the blood too much and
cause bleeding, so consult your doctor.
 Black cohosh: Marketed primarily to help women with night sweats and
hot flashes, black cohosh (a medicinal herb) hasn’t yet proven its effec-
tiveness in formal research studies. Some studies have shown that black
cohosh is downright dangerous, sometimes triggering an autoimmune
response in the body that attacks the liver. Don’t take this without first
consulting your doctor about the potential risks.
 SAMe: Short for S-Adenosylmethionine, SAMe (a natural substance
found in your body) has been proved to function effectively as an antide-
pressant in some studies. However, SAMe can induce mania at rates sim-
ilar to the SSRI antidepressants (see Chapter 7), making it extremely
risky for treating bipolar depression. Don’t even think about using SAMe
before trying all other standard treatment options and consulting your
doctor. Another drawback — it isn’t cheap.
 GABA: GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid, an inhibitory of the nervous
system neurotransmitter) has been touted as a treatment for mood dis-
orders because it’s related to depression, anxiety, and mania in the
brain. However, GABA taken as an oral supplement doesn’t cross the
blood–brain barrier. It doesn’t even get into the brain and is therefore
useless. This particular “natural” cure is a fraud.
 Taurine: An amino acid, taurine helps regulate the electrical activity in
the brain and may counteract the effects of excitatory neurotransmit-
ters, including dopamine and norepinephrine. Some studies show that
taurine levels are depleted in the brains of people with bipolar disorder,
but no studies currently show that taking supplements will improve
depression.
154
Part III: Opening the Treatment Toolbox: A Comprehensive, Integrated Approach 

 Melatonin: Melatonin is a hormone that the brain uses in response to light
and dark and is part of the body’s sleep/wake machinery. Supplements
may reduce insomnia for sufferers of some types of sleep problems. It’s
safe for short-term use, even in children. Check with your doctor before
you use melatonin, however, because it can interact with some psychi-
atric medications.
 5-HTP: This supplement provides your body with the building blocks it
needs to assemble serotonin, but no evidence proves that taking supple-
ments of 5-HTP improves mood.
 Valerian: Valerian is an herb commonly marketed for the treatment of
insomnia. Although studies are currently deemed inconclusive, some
have reported positive results. Valerian appears to be relatively safe, 
but be cautious, especially if you’re taking other medications or are
pregnant or nursing.
 Kava: This plant/herbal product purportedly reduces stress and anxiety,
but some reports have linked it to liver damage, so practice extreme
caution.
Before ingesting natural substances, check with your doctor, and do addi-
tional research on your own. A reliable information source is the National
Institute of Health’s National Center for Complementary and Alternative
Medicine (NCCAM). Check out its Web site at www.nccam.nih.gov.
Bathing Your Brain with Electricity,
Magnetic Stimulation, and Light
Past practices in psychiatry instill a fear in some mentally ill patients. If they
hear of any treatments designed to physically alter the structure or electrical
activity of the brain, they may panic. “Lobotomy? Electroshock? No way!
Nobody’s scrambling my brain!”
Fortunately, lobotomies are no longer commonplace, and electroshock therapy
isn’t as shocking as it once was. In fact, many people with bipolar disorder
have found that of all the treatment options currently available, electroshock
(electroconvulsive) therapy is the safest and most effective option.
However, you should always approach any treatment with a healthy dose of
skepticism and understand its potential risks and benefits. In the spirit of
keeping you informed, the following sections describe three additional treat-
ment options: electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic
stimulation, and light therapy.
155
Chapter 9: Expanding Your Treatment Options

Zapping your moods with ECT 
(electroconvulsive therapy)
In the past, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) was extremely traumatic, at least
in the movies. A burly orderly would strap the patient to a gurney, shove a
block of wood in his mouth, and stick a couple of electrodes to his temples. 
A devious doctor would saunter in, donning a virgin-white lab coat, and
toggle the on/off switch, jolting the patient’s brain with wave after wave 
of high-voltage current. Needless to say, it wasn’t something that many
people looked forward to.
Modern techniques have significantly reduced the trauma and the drama of
ECT. Nowadays, the doctor uses sedatives to keep you sleeping through the
procedure and muscle relaxants to loosen you up so you don’t hurt yourself.
The doctor applies a low-voltage current for only one or two seconds. The
current triggers a seizure, although your body doesn’t physically seizure
because of the muscle relaxants. The repeated seizure activity, usually three
times a week for about 12 weeks, is responsible for relieving mood symp-
toms. About 80 percent of patients experience significant relief from symp-
toms of both depression and mania and report relatively mild side effects,
such as temporary memory loss and blood pressure changes. ECT is used
commonly in elderly and frail individuals who can’t tolerate antidepressants
and antimanic medications. In these people, ECT has proven very effective.
Why would anyone consider ECT? The primary reasons include the following:
 Nothing else works for you.
 Your depression or mania is severe and requires fast relief of acute
symptoms.
 You can’t take antidepressants or antimanics, for some reason.
 You don’t want to take medicine.
 You’re pregnant, nursing, or plan to become pregnant, and you’re con-
cerned about the effects of various medicines on the fetus.
ECT’s main side effect is memory loss, which is usually temporary. Other
potential risks include reactions to the anesthetic or muscle relaxant and
possible changes to heart rhythm and blood pressure. Your doctor will evalu-
ate your health before treatment and monitor it during treatment for any
signs of distress.
Researchers are experimenting with another electromagnetic treatment,
called VNS (Vagus Nerve Stimulation), that has been used successfully to
reduce epileptic seizures. An electronic implant that functions as a pace-
maker for the brain sends electrical signals to a specific brain region through
the vagus nerve for a few seconds each minute. Although VNS stimulation
may be effective in treating depression, records show at least one reported
case of hypomania occurring during this treatment.
156
Part III: Opening the Treatment Toolbox: A Comprehensive, Integrated Approach 

Moderating moods with rTMS (repetitive
transcranial magnetic stimulation)
Powerful magnets, similar to those used in MRIs, may be able to reset your
brain’s electrical power grid with less trauma than ECT causes. Several stud-
ies have shown that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may
be just as effective as ECT at treating depression and carries less risk of
memory loss. However, the research so far indicates that rTMS appears to 
be less effective at treating mania and may induce hypomania and mania in
some patients.
The course of treatment typically calls for five half-hour sessions per week
for six weeks. No anesthetic is required, and few patients report any pain,
although some have reported a tightening of the skin, especially around the
scalp and jaw, and a knocking sensation in the skull, which may be partially
due to the sound of the machine. Very little risk of memory loss or seizure
accompanies the procedure.
rTMS treatment is still in its early, experimental stage and is not yet an
approved or widely available treatment. Researchers are working with the
intensity and frequency of the magnetic pulses to reduce potential side
effects.

Bringing Max back through ECT
Max was an 82-year-old gentleman with a long
history of bipolar disorder. He had been on
lithium for many years, but he could no longer
take it due to his many other medical complica-
tions. He was a successful businessman and a
widower with five children and numerous
grandchildren. Max came to the psychiatric
hospital with his oldest son after several weeks
of declining mood and function. He had stopped
eating and sleeping. He was disheveled and
dirty, and he mumbled to himself during his first
few days in the hospital. Eventually, Max was
taken to the recovery room for ECT treatment.
With his hospital gown open in the back, he
slumped over in the wheelchair and tried to hide
a cigarette and lighter that he had liberated
from another patient in the unit while he headed
down for his first treatment. Max received three
treatments during his week in the hospital. He
was then discharged and continued to come in
for regular treatments.
Two months later, Max arrived for his treatment
at 6 a.m. He was wearing a suit and a big smile.
His son was with him and reported that the family
was preparing to take him to the finest restaurant
in town for a Father’s Day celebration. Max told
stories about his oldest grandchildren learning to
drive, and he chatted easily with the nurses about
their plans for the weekend. Max was back.

Shining some light on depression
Bears hibernate during winter, perhaps because they know how grumpy they
would be if they didn’t. Humans, on the other hand, choose to remain active
and often irritable throughout the winter. How depressed you become may
have something to do with the amount of light you receive. Some moods,
especially those of bipolar sufferers, are very responsive to light; too little
light leads to deep depression, and too much light sparks mania.
Light therapy, also called phototherapy, can often boost your moods, espe-
cially for those whose moods are at the mercy of the seasons. But not just
any light will do. Sitting in a tanning booth, for example, probably won’t pro-
vide you with sufficient light at the right wavelength, and the bed may blast
you with too much UV light. For safe, effective phototherapy, follow these
guidelines:
 Consult your doctor, first and foremost.
 Proceed with light therapy only under the direction and supervision of a
qualified professional. Time of day, frequency, and duration of treatment
are critical factors.
 Use a device designed specifically for the purpose of providing pho-
totherapy. Most light boxes use special fluorescent bulbs rated at 
10,000 lux.
Therapy consists of sitting for 10 minutes to an hour facing the light box, but
you don’t need to stare directly into the light. You can read the morning
paper, drink your orange juice, work a crossword puzzle, or do whatever you
normally do, as long as you face the light.
Too much light can cause hypomania and mania, especially during seasonal
changes when you receive more light from natural sources. You and your
doctor need to monitor your intake of light just as carefully as if you were
monitoring your dose of medication.

lthough your doctor, therapist, family, and friends
may be willing to pitch in when you need them, you
should work toward taking ownership of the situation and
doing whatever you can to control your own destiny. But
first, you need to find out what the heck just happened.
After a major depressive or manic episode, making sense
of what happened and taking inventory of the damage it
caused in your life can be terribly difficult. We dedicate
the first chapter in this part to helping you make it over
this first hurdle.
After you begin treatment, the remaining chapters in this
part help you paddle upstream on the river to recovery.
We show you how to reclaim your life and restructure it to
reduce stress, how to monitor and manage your moods,
how to take care of yourself, and how to let other people
lend assistance without becoming too intrusive.

ith most illnesses or injuries, you know exactly what to do, and if
you’re faced with an emergency you can’t handle, you dial 911 and let
the professionals deal with it. With bipolar disorder, however, you and those
around you may not even notice that you’re ill. Maybe you feel overly tired
and achy, or perhaps you feel juiced up and more alert and productive.
Others may perceive you as disinterested and confrontational or lively and
captivating. But sick? Heck no. You look perfectly healthy. In fact, you may
look and feel better than ever. So what’s the problem?
When your moods begin to wield undue influence over your behaviors, 
interfering with your life, your relationships, and your ability to keep your
thoughts and actions in check, you have a problem. All too quickly, the 
disorder can push your life into a tailspin that traumatizes your brain and
body and often wreaks havoc on your life and the lives of those around you.
To survive during these times of crisis, early detection and aggressive inter-
vention are the keys. The sooner you can recognize trouble, get help, and
obtain effective treatment, the faster you can resolve the crisis and prevent
collateral damage.
In this chapter, we help you identify the signs and symptoms of major mood
episodes so you and your support network can intervene as quickly as possi-
ble. We tell you who to call when you first recognize the early warning signs
and how to talk to people to make them listen. Finally, we describe some
medical interventions that have proved successful in helping others make a
safe, soft landing from a major mood episode.

Checking Your Mood Pulse
You’re very ill. Or are you? To outsiders, you probably don’t appear to have
anything they would describe as an “illness.” Friends and family members
may sense that “you’re not your normal self,” but even close friends may hes-
itate to tell you that you seem overly tired or wired. Inside, you may feel too
tired to do anything, too dispirited to care, or so incredibly good that you
can’t possibly conceive of yourself as being ill.
When the people around you don’t provide honest or reliable feedback and
your own mood meter is busted, how do you obtain an objective measure of
your mood? Self-evaluation may not be entirely reliable, but by completing a
survey or a depression or mania scale, you can obtain a clearer insight into
how you really feel.
If you’re feeling down but don’t know if you should be concerned, complete
the depression scale we describe in the following section. If you’re feeling
overly energetic, irritable, or active, skip ahead and complete the mania scale.
Self-diagnosis is no substitute for a professional psychiatric evaluation and
diagnosis. If you’re suffering emotionally or psychologically, or if you’re
having thoughts of death or suicide, seek professional help immediately. Use
the depression and mania scales included here only for your own reference
and to provide additional information to your doctor.
Rating your depression
To complete the depression scale (see Figure 10-1), circle T (true) or F (false)
next to each statement based on how you’ve felt over the last two weeks. If
you see several statements that apply, we encourage you to consult a doctor
or therapist for a professional evaluation.
Measuring your mania
To complete the mania scale (shown in Figure 10-2), circle T (true) or F (false)
next to each statement, based on how you’ve felt recently or how you’ve felt
in the past. If several statements seem true and your thought processes or
behaviors are interfering with some aspect of your life, we encourage you to
consult a doctor or therapist for a professional evaluation.
The mania scale is intended to help you identify recent manic symptoms. But
if you’ve ever experienced the symptoms described in the mania scale for
more than a few hours while not intoxicated, you may have bipolar disorder.
Consult a psychiatrist for a more thorough evaluation.

Part IV: Helping Yourself 

Calling for Backup
Normally, your rational mind lounges on your shoulder and provides a run-
ning commentary of sage advice. It makes sure you take care of yourself,
drive safely, spend wisely, and generally stay out of trouble. Depression and
mania aim to knock that angelic voice off your shoulder, relinquishing your
mind to the chatter of anarchy. At this point, you need a replacement. You
need immediate help, or at least someone to keep you out of trouble until
reinforcements arrive.
Who ya gonna call?
Luckily for you, help is only a phone call away. Stay put, and call someone on
the following list:
 A reliable friend who can get you out of trouble rather than get you into
more trouble.
 A family member who won’t try to convince you that you’re fine.
Family members, particularly those who are caught up in the drama of
the moment with you, may not be the best choice.
 Your insurance company, which may have a mental health line with an
emergency number you can call for immediate assistance. Some compa-
nies even have mental health case managers who are trained to spot
trouble.
 Your minister or the minister of any established church in your area.
 Your primary-care physician, who may be able to give you something for
temporary relief.
 Your psychiatrist or therapist, who can counsel you through a crisis or
adjust your medications.
 Other professional resources, such as 911, 800-SUICIDE (800-784-2433),
or 800-273-TALK (800-273-8255).
When depression or mania strikes, the question isn’t “Should I call someone
for help?” but “Who should I call for help?” You need a reliable person on your
side — someone who can keep a watchful eye on you, drive you around, and
get you to professionals who can help. Depression and mania are dangerous
and often lethal. Assuming that depression will eventually dissipate or that
mania will burn itself out is risky, both to yourself and to those around you.
165
Chapter 10: Surviving Your Current Crisis

Why don’t they listen to me?
If you were drowning in a lake, thrashing about in the water and screaming
for help, anyone within earshot would come running and do whatever they
could to save you. When you’re depressed or manic and you cry for help,
people stare at you as if your cell phone just rang in the middle of a movie.
Some people just want you to shut up. Others actually try to convince you
that you’re okay, or they tell you to tough it out. Meanwhile, back in your
head, you’re starring in your own personal horror flick.
Why don’t some people listen when a depressed or manic person cries for
help? Several reasons come to mind:
 They can’t see the immediate danger.
 They haven’t been trained to identify the signs of depression or mania.
 They’re unaware of the serious potential consequences of your manic or
depressive behavior.
 They’re too scared or intimidated (if your mania has made you angry or
confrontational).
 They’re angry with you, with themselves, or with the current situation.
 They really don’t understand what you have to be depressed about, as if
that matters.
 They hail from the days when people didn’t talk about their feelings.
 They were raised to believe that people have complete control over
their moods.
 They’ve never experienced dramatic mood swings.
Blaming people for not being empathetic does you no good. With a little edu-
cation, the people who make up your support group can develop a deeper
sense of empathy, but that takes time and effort. For now, that’s not some-
thing you need to worry about. But you do need to know that some people
are incapable of hearing your cries for help. Don’t waste your time trying to
convince them. Move on to the next name on your list of emergency contacts
and call for help. Don’t stop until you find someone who can hear you and
provide the assistance you need.
Recognizing how it looks to outsiders and feels to you
Human beings are prone to judge behaviors, not necessarily to understand
them. When you see someone who looks perfectly healthy lying in bed all
day, you may think “lazy” rather than “sick.” When you see a high roller, the
life of the party, you think “fun” or “entertaining,” not “ill.” If someone gets in
your face and batters you with insults, you think “jerk,” not “patient.” During
a major mood episode, especially depression, you know better, because you
know how you feel inside. But outsiders don’t.
166
Part IV: Helping Yourself 

Keep in mind that other people really don’t know how you feel. You can try
describing your sensations, but even your lucid words are unlikely to con-
vince most people — what they see and believe often trump whatever you
tell them.
Communication also becomes strained because the extreme behavior of
bipolar disorder tends to embitter your allies and make them less receptive
to your needs. When depression saps your energy or makes you irritable,
friends, coworkers, and family members typically carry a heavier load. When
mania drives you to whip everything into a frenzy, your loved ones may
become defensive and impatient. The only symptoms of this illness that your
loved ones can observe are your behaviors. They can feel the pain that they
themselves feel, but they can’t feel the pain you feel. In the best of all possi-
ble worlds, family and friends have a mutual understanding that transcends
the bad times, but the reality of bipolar disorder can drive a wedge between
you and your loved ones.

Chapter 10: Surviving Your Current Crisis
Sally’s (not-so-) silent suffering
For several weeks, Sally’s moods were flying
higher and higher. At the school where she
taught, she was on a mission to improve class-
room behavior by handing out dozens of demer-
its and referrals daily. Her principal called her
into the office several times to discuss the situ-
ation, and Sally argued that the school’s disci-
plinary policy was too lax. One day when Sally
complained to the other teachers, her principal
wrote her up for insubordination.
When Sally returned home that night, she com-
plained about her job and cried about the injus-
tice at work. At dinner, she chastised her children
for their poor table manners and corrected their
grammar whenever they spoke. She turned on
her husband for allowing the children to behave
in such abominable ways. He told her to calm
down and to realize how good she really had it.
Sally spent the rest of the evening calling the par-
ents of students who were causing problems in
class. Her husband spent the evening drinking.
Sally stayed awake that night. It was her third
night without sleep. Realizing that something
wasn’t right, she called in sick the next day and
asked her husband to take her to the doctor. He
was busy with his own work and upset from the
night before, so he told her to drive herself.
At the doctor’s office, Sally begged her doctor for
a sedative, something to calm her nerves. When
the doctor asked Sally questions, she became
combative and demanded medication. She said
that if her arm were cut and bleeding, they would
do something to help, so why were they refusing
to help her now? The doctor told Sally that until
she calmed down, he wouldn’t give her anything.
She stormed out of the office.
On the way home from the doctor, Sally stopped
at the grocery store. She became disoriented
and collapsed somewhere near the public
phones. An alert stranger rushed over and dialed
a number in Sally’s cell phone, the phone number
of an old friend in town. Her friend drove over,
picked her up, and took her to the hospital, where
she was diagnosed with a severe manic episode
and began treatment.

Talking so they will listen
During normal mood cycles, asking for help when you need it is a no-brainer.
You know when you need help, and you’re coherent enough to ask for it. But
when you’re depressed or manic, especially before you’ve been diagnosed
with bipolar disorder, you often have no idea what’s going on. You feel lousy,
you’re mad about it, you don’t want to feel like this, and you don’t believe
that anything or anyone can help you. So you do what any miserable person
would do — rant, rave, cry, complain, slam doors, or lie in bed. And if you’re
feeling high, you spend loads of money, have tons of sex, and find any way
possible to keep the good times rolling.
Few people interpret your actions as desperate cries for help. You need some-
thing more effective, more direct — something that accurately describes your
inner turmoil and specifies the kind of help you need. When you call a friend,
family member, or someone else for help (see the section “Who ya gonna call?”
earlier in this chapter), supply the following three pieces of information:
 A description of how you feel physically and any inner thoughts and feel-
ings you have
 Whether you’re having thoughts of death or suicide
 The type of help you want (Do you need a ride to your doctor’s office or
the emergency room? Do you want the person to phone a family
member? Do you need someone to go to the doctor with you?)
When asking a family member for help, pretend that you’re asking a stranger.
When you’ve known someone for 10 or 20 years, you tend to think that the
person is or should be in tune with your needs and should know what you
want. Unfortunately, this is rarely true. During a crisis, you need specific help,
so make your request very specific.
Taking Immediate Action
After you find someone to help you, you need to act immediately to obtain a
psychiatric evaluation and diagnosis and to start receiving treatment. Take
the following steps:
1. Seek medical help from a doctor or psychiatrist.
Medication is almost always required to end the mood episode, and
sometimes brief hospitalization may help. Chapter 3 includes instruc-
tions and a checklist to help you prepare for hospitalization.
2. Seek a stable living arrangement with someone who can help you.
If you live alone, ask friends or family members to move in temporarily,
or ask if you can live with them. If your condition poses a risk to your
safety or the safety of others, hospitalization may be necessary.
168
Part IV: Helping Yourself 

3. If you work, call in sick, or have a friend or family member call 
for you.
All you need to say is that you’re ill and can’t come to work. Although
your employer has no right to fire you when you’re ill, calling in sick pro-
vides you with additional legal protection, just in case. (Chapter 13 pro-
vides additional advice for dealing with situations at work.)
4. Have a friend or family member contact your health insurance com-
pany for details on how to proceed.
You don’t want to get stuck paying a big bill when you get released.
If you’re experiencing mania, you may want to give your car keys, credit
cards, debit cards, and checkbook to your friends or family members until
your moods stabilize. (See Chapter 17 for additional crisis-management 
suggestions.)
Battling Back from an Acute Attack
When experiencing a major mood episode — depression or mania — the first
order of business, after identifying the problem, of course, is to stop it in its
tracks. If left to run its course, a major mood episode can get you into all
sorts of trouble and negatively affect the fragile balance of brain physiology
and chemistry. In this section, we show how you can effectively knock out a
raging mood episode with the one-two punch of medication and rest.
Making a safe landing from 
a manic episode
When mania hurls you out of orbit, and you first realize you have a problem,
your first impulse is to turn the spaceship around and plummet back to the
earth, but your re-entry can be just as traumatic as the dizzying heights of
mania. You need to come down from the manic high as quickly as possible,
but you don’t want to be so doped up that you enter a tailspin of depression.
In response to a major manic episode, your doctor may prescribe one of the
following medications:
 Lithium, a mood stabilizer
 An anticonvulsant, such as Depakote, that functions well as an antimanic
 An atypical antipsychotic, such as Zyprexa, Risperdal, Seroquel, Geodon,
or Abilify, that also functions well as an antimanic medication
169
Chapter 10: Surviving Your Current Crisis

Medications vary in how fast they work. Some, like Depakote, can be “loaded
up” so you jump right to your goal dose. Others take a few days to weeks to
work up to the right dose.
Mood stabilizers rarely bring you down from a major manic episode immedi-
ately. You may experience ongoing symptoms for several weeks.
Depending on the severity of your mania and your additional symptoms, such
as psychosis, your doctor may prescribe the use of two or more antimanic
medications — often lithium with an anticonvulsant or atypical antipsychotic.
Your doctor may also prescribe a sedative to help you sleep. Chapter 7 pro-
vides additional information on specific medications.
Follow your doctor’s orders concerning sedatives. Overdosing on sedatives
can be dangerous. Avoid any use of alcohol or other depressants, which can
form a lethal combination when used with sedatives.
Lifting the darkness of depression
When depression drags you to the dungeon, you may turn to an antidepres-
sant as the logical medication to help you climb back to the light, but when
bipolar disorder is the dungeon master holding you down, an antidepressant
alone can be risky business. Assuming your doctor suspects that you have
170
Part IV: Helping Yourself 
Avoiding chemical con artists
Alcohol, stimulants, and illicit drugs lure many
bipolar sufferers into the self-medication (or,
more aptly, self-destruction) trap. Alcohol,
because it’s both legal and readily available, is
particularly alluring. With chemical properties
similar to the makeup of sedatives, it tricks
people by seeming to soothe anxiety and agita-
tion. It can also make people feel less inhibited,
leading them to believe that it eases the sad-
ness and guilt of depression. But alcohol is a
con artist. Although you feel better briefly, the
chemicals continuously work to depress your
brain and worsen your symptoms over the long
haul.
During mania, many bipolar sufferers drink alco-
hol as part of their overboard behaviors, but
they also frequently turn to stimulants or uppers.
Uppers seem to focus the racing brain and offer
temporary relief from the manic mental whirl-
wind. But danger lurks here as well. Stimulants
cause sleep deprivation, which worsens mania,
and they can induce psychosis.
Self-medication can worsen symptoms, inter-
fere with medications, and lead to dependency
or addiction to the abused substance. These
patterns fuel bipolar disorder rather than cool it,
even if you seem to feel good at first. Although
the prescribed medications may not feel as
good initially, they’re going to help, not hurt, in
the long run. If you’re currently self-medicating,
talk to your doctor and your support group about
your substance use, and make a decision to
stay on track with the good stuff and avoid the
bad stuff.

bipolar depression rather than unipolar depression, he’s likely to treat you
with a mood stabilizer that has antidepressant qualities first, such as lithium,
Lamictal, or Symbyax (a combination of Zyprexa and Prozac, the first FDA-
approved medication for bipolar depression).
These mood stabilizers have proved effective in treating bipolar depression
without triggering mania. The antidepressant Wellbutrin is also commonly
used because it may bring less risk of inducing mania.
If your mood stabilizer alone is ineffective, or if your depression is extreme,
your doctor may add an antidepressant — usually an SSRI (Selective Serotonin
Reuptake Inhibitor), which we explain in Chapter 7. If psychosis or agitation
layers the mix, your doctor may prescribe an atypical antipsychotic as well.
Attending to the “minor” details
Your train wreck of a mood episode has derailed the engine, and the passen-
ger cars you’ve been pulling are barely hanging on to the rails. That’s not your
problem. You need to focus on getting your engine back on track. However, if
you don’t get the rest of the train back on track to prevent it from being rear-
ended by other events, you’ll have even more problems to contend with after
your recovery.
The only solution is to delegate. Have the people in your support network
handle the minor details. The to-do list you hand a lucky individual (or
group) will probably contain many of the following items:
 Care instructions and tips for your children, if you have young children
 Care instructions for any pets
 A list of essential errands
 A reminder to let your boss know how long you’ll miss work
 A reminder to check on your insurance coverage and to make sure pre-
miums are paid
 Small reminders to check the mail, pay the bills, and stay in touch
Avoid the temptation to return to work too soon. Full recovery from a major
mood episode can take several months. Chapter 11 provides some tips on
how to ease back into your old life at your own pace. Chapter 13 offers 
additional tips on restructuring your life and dealing with issues at home 
and work.

B
attling bipolar disorder is like going 12 rounds against a world-class
prizefighter. Everyone in your corner cheers you on as your pugilistic
opponent pounds your puss. The cut man in the corner patches you up after
each round, and your trainer offers a few words of encouragement just before
sending you in for another three-minute bashing. You feel like throwing in the
towel, but you’re no quitter, so you hang in there and keep taking it on the chin.
All too often, people respond to a mood disorder this way. The doctor
patches you up with medication; your therapist and support network offer
some encouragement; and you step back into the ring, still reeling from the
mental thumping you took during your previous mood episode. Not only are
you weaker and more vulnerable than before, but you’ve also fallen behind at
work and probably have a host of additional problems to deal with — the
perfect setting for a relapse.
During your recovery, keep in mind that this is no prize fight and you’re no
Rocky Balboa. Push other people’s expectations to one side, focus on your
recovery, and retain your focus until you feel ready to return. Of course, this
sounds easier than it is. You may have a job, a family, a home, bills — the list
goes on. Without a full recovery, however, all these important elements in
your life remain in jeopardy.

In this chapter, we encourage you to make a full recovery your number-one
priority. We help you come to terms with the aftermath of a major mood
episode and deal with the fallout. We also reveal the importance of focusing
on your health and well-being first and show you how to retreat to a place
that’s more conducive to convalescence. And when you’re ready, we provide
instructions on how to smoothly transition back to your family and job.
Making Recovery Your 
Number-One Priority
Long-term recovery requires long-term solutions, including medication man-
agement; individual therapy; relationship therapy; and, in many cases, family
therapy. You may be tempted to try solving it all at once, especially if you’re
coming down from a manic high. In most cases, however, you have a better
chance of moving forward by taking smaller steps and initially focusing on
your own health and well-being, a process we discuss in this section.
Coming to terms with what just happened
After your doctor quells the most severe symptoms, you may feel as though
you’ve just woken up from a bad dream. You look back at the episode and
wonder what just happened. Well, what just happened is that your brain seri-
ously malfunctioned for some reason, driving your mood up or down to an
intolerable level.
That’s what happened to your brain, but what happened as a result of your
brain’s mutiny may encompass much more than your personal anatomy and
inner thoughts and feelings. The fallout, especially from a manic episode,
may strain your relationships, career, finances, and social status. And if you
performed any illegal acts during the mood episode, you may need to con-
tend with court dates, fines, parole officers, and even jail time.
Although these issues may cry out for your immediate attention, avoidance is
often the most prudent maneuver for now. After you fully recover, you can
begin to focus on any fallout (see the section “Reclaiming Your Life When the
Time Is Right,” later in this chapter, to begin picking up the pieces).
174
Part IV: Helping Yourself 

Knowing what to expect
How fast and fully you recover from depression or mania depends primarily
on the severity of the mood episode and how well you respond to treatment.
You may be one of the lucky few who respond within days of treatment, or
you and your doctor may spend weeks or longer trying to find the right mix
of medicines and therapy.

Chapter 11: Healing at Your Own Pace
Bernard’s Vegas nightmare
Bernard had lived a driven, energized life as a
young man. He played college football and went
on to become a successful investment banker.
He had an episode of depression right after col-
lege, but he experienced no other symptoms
from that point on. He married his college
sweetheart, and they had four sons together.
Life was good.
Around the time of his 15th wedding anniver-
sary, Bernard began to believe that he didn’t
need to work anymore because he was going to
write a best-selling novel. He didn’t start writing
or taking courses; he just knew in his heart that
he was a great writer and would be famous and
wealthy very soon. He began skipping work and
taking trips to Las Vegas, almost every week,
“for research.” He slept little, gambled and
drank a lot, and started a relationship with a
casino waitress. He regaled his comrades at the
high rollers’ tables with tales of his novel writing
and sexual prowess.
With each trip, Bernard stayed longer and
longer, and his family became increasingly
frightened, panicked, and angry about his
absences and their rapidly dwindling bank
accounts and investments. His colleagues at
work were fed up with covering for him, so they
divided up his accounts among themselves,
leaving Bernard jobless. The next week, he
brought his girlfriend from Vegas home to New
York and took her out to dinner with his sons.
Sarah, Bernard’s wife — like many people in
similar situations — didn’t make the connection
between her husband’s behavior and bipolar
disorder. She was enraged at first, but gradually
she began to recognize the manic symptoms
because her father had suffered from bipolar
disorder. She rallied their families and friends
and began coaxing, cajoling, and bribing
Bernard into treatment. The journey was long
and difficult for everyone. When the dust finally
settled, and he returned to his old self, he was
devastated. He had lost his job and almost lost
his family, and his son was applying to colleges,
but he had no way to pay for them. Bernard,
with the help of his doctor and family, worked
on putting the pieces back together, including a
change of careers that allowed for more down
time and a slower pace. The family adjusted —
not always easily — to a change in financial
status. Bernard struggled with feelings of guilt
about what he did to his family, but he and his
family gradually came to understand that it was
the illness that had hurt them and not Bernard.

As your body adjusts to the medications and your mood begins to stabilize,
you may experience one or more of the following effects:
 Memory difficulties: You may not recall periods of time during the
mood episode, especially during a manic episode. Some medications or
treatments, such as ECT (see Chapter 9), can also cause memory loss,
making it difficult to function at 100 percent.
 Increased/decreased energy: Antidepressants and other medications
may pep you up, and antimanic medications and sedatives may drag you
down. Don’t be surprised if you need significantly more sleep after a
manic episode — your body and brain need time to recuperate.
 Anxiety: Some medications can increase anxiety, so be sure to report
any increase in anxiety levels to your doctor. In addition, people fre-
quently and understandably become anxious after a mood episode due
to worries about family, work, relationships, bills, and other facets of
their lives that may be in upheaval.
 Confusion: A major mood episode and the medications used to treat it
can muddle your thinking. You may wonder who you really are and how
the medications will affect you. Until you know more about bipolar dis-
order, you may realize that something’s not right, but you don’t know
exactly what’s wrong.
Many of these symptoms are most prevalent when you begin taking a medica-
tion, but they diminish over time. If the symptoms are intolerable or persist
for more than a week, contact your doctor.
Antidepressants often take as long as three to six weeks to become fully effec-
tive. Don’t stop taking them just because they don’t have an immediate
effect. Also, don’t stop taking any medication just because you begin to feel
better. Always consult your doctor before making any medication changes.
Mastering the art of selfishness
People who suffer from mania and depression are often the movers and shak-
ers of the world. They’re working nights and weekends, taking care of the kids,
and volunteering for neighborhood service. They focus on meeting the needs
of others. But when you ask these Type-A personalities what they need, they
can’t give you a straight answer, because most of them don’t know. They
don’t pause long enough from their busy schedules to take a personal inven-
tory of their needs, and even if they did, they probably wouldn’t ask for help.
If this sounds like you, a mood episode may signal the time for a change — 
a time for you to become more aware of your needs and more assertive in
176
Part IV: Helping Yourself 

meeting them, a time to begin working on developing the fine art of selfish-
ness. During your recovery, you need to look out for number one.
Assessing your needs
The first step in mastering selfishness is to figure out what you need and how
to ensure that your needs are met (either by you or someone else). To assess
your needs, try the following exercise:
1. Write down five to ten needs, starting with your most immediate need.
For example, “I need help getting the kids ready for school in the morning.”
2. Brainstorm ways to have each need met, including the names of
people who can help, such as friends or family members.
You may be able to meet some needs on your own, such as taking an
hour at the end of the work day to wind down.
3. Take the best idea for meeting each need, and draw up a plan for 
executing it.
4. If you need assistance, write a detailed description of the type of help
you need and the amount of time required.
Contact the people who can help, and request their assistance.
5. Put your plan into action.
Getting used to saying “no”
Mastering the art of selfishness requires you to become sensitive to your
needs and to avoid overcommitting your time and energy. In short, learn how
to say “no.” If you have trouble saying no, try the following lines:
 “I would love to help, but I really have too much on my plate right now.”
 “I’m sorry, but I really want to spend more time with my family.”
 “I haven’t been feeling quite like myself lately. Can you call me back 
next year?”
 “I’ll have to check my schedule and get back to you on this. What’s your
number again?”
 “I’m sorry, but we’ve donated all we can this year.”
 “We have a policy of donating only to educational institutions.”
 “Excuse me, I think someone is calling in on the other line.”
 “Oh, dear, my cat just tipped over the trash.”

Chapter 11: Healing at Your Own Pace

Caller ID costs a little extra, but it can help you screen out the most annoying
callers. Or you can let your answering machine pick up and then return the
call later. If telemarketers are infringing on your peace and tranquility, con-
sider having your name added to the National Do Not Call Registry. You can
do this online at www.donotcall.gov.
Retreating to a safe, quiet place
The most obvious place to recuperate from a major mood episode — your
home — isn’t always the best. If you live alone, the solitude may aggravate
your symptoms, and without the watchful eyes of a support person and some
human interaction, you may slip back into depression or mania. If your home
is tense or you live with unsupportive family members, the environment can
be downright toxic. You want a safe and quiet place, a structured environ-
ment with the right combination of the following elements:
 Tranquility: Peace and quiet are essential in relieving anxiety, especially
after a manic episode.
 Activity: Although rest is important, too much rest can lead to depression.
 Interactivity: Remaining connected to friends, family members, and col-
leagues provides additional social support.
 Support: Somebody should be available to help you follow your treat-
ment plan and to remain on call if you need assistance.
 Routine: A structured routine with regular wake times, bed times, meals,
and activities can help the recovery from both depression and mania.
Living arrangements that meet these criteria may include staying with a friend
or family member or, if necessary, going into a hospital, halfway house, or
other temporary residence. Having a friend stay with you can sometimes pro-
vide support and companionship if you live alone or supply an ally and advo-
cate if you live with family members who don’t get it. Remember not to stray
too far from your medical and personal support networks when looking for
places to stay.
If your family situation has deteriorated, avoid the impulse to move out on
your own. Solitude can often deepen depression and unleash your manic
impulses. Some degree of personal support almost always improves the treat-
ment outcome.
If you decide to return home with family members, we strongly encourage
your family members to learn more about bipolar disorder and make any nec-
essary adjustments to ease your transition. Family therapy can play a critical
178
Part IV: Helping Yourself 

role in your successful recovery, as we explain in Chapter 8. At the very least,
you and your family should plan on making the following adjustments:
 Regulate schedules. Set times for waking up, eating meals, and going 
to bed.
 Ease your workload. Your family must pick up the slack during 
your recovery.
 Crank down the volume. Total silence isn’t required, but if you have to
shout over the stereo and television, lower the overall decibel level.
 Create a retreat for yourself. Designate a quiet place where you can
escape during times of stress.
 Outlaw criticism, demand, and judgment. These patterns are the most
common sources of conflict and stress, and families frequently don’t
even realize how much conflict goes on.
 Avoid conflict. Eventually, all families must address problems that arise,
but during the recovery period, everyone must avoid serious conflict as
much as possible.
You don’t necessarily need to move out in order to cultivate a safe, quiet
place. With the support of friends and family, you can usually create such 
a place right at home.
Following your doctor’s orders
Your doctor will give you an earful about the importance of taking your med-
ications as directed and sticking with your treatment plan, so we won’t bore
you with another lecture. What your doctor may omit, however, are instruc-
tions about what to do if your medications don’t work or if they produce
undesirable side effects. Here are four simple rules for sticking with your
treatment plan and making adjustments if the plan doesn’t produce the
desired results:
 Give it time. Some medications take several days or several weeks to
become fully effective. During the adjustment period, most negative side
effects taper off.
 Keep a record. Take notes whenever you start a new medicine or
change your dosage so you can provide your doctor with detailed feed-
back on how the medicine affected your feelings and behavior. Chapter
12 provides a mood chart and sleep log with note-keeping areas for log-
ging medication changes.
179
Chapter 11: Healing at Your Own Pace

 Communicate your concerns. Feeling just okay is unacceptable. If you
experience negative side effects, contact your doctor for suggestions on
how to minimize them. If your doctor seems insensitive to your con-
cerns, find a doctor you can work with.
 Consult with your doctor before making any changes. Don’t play doctor,
and don’t stop taking a medication without your doctor’s approval.
Treatment for bipolar disorder is highly individual; what works for one
patient won’t necessarily work for another. Team up with your doctor to dis-
cover the most effective treatment plan for you. Your job is to clearly commu-
nicate the way you feel so your doctor has the information she needs to make
well-informed decisions and adjustments.
Close, timely communication with your doctor is essential, especially when
you’re starting a medication or changing medications. If your doctor doesn’t
provide a timely response, you need to find another doctor who does.
Reclaiming Your Life When 
the Time Is Right
You found the perfect place to recover — a private little beach in Bora Bora,
two blocks down from your psychiatrist’s grass hut. You’re resting in your
hammock and reading this book without a care in the world.
We hope you have a good vacation, but eventually, you need to sail back to
reality — return to your family and friends; deal with your problems; and,
unless you’re independently wealthy, find some gainful employment that’s
not too stressful.
In this section, we help you determine when you’re ready to board your
cruise ship home, and we provide some tips to ease the transition.
Knowing when you’re ready 
(the preflight checklist)
When you dislocate your kneecap, your doctor doesn’t pop it back in place
and send you on your way. He probably recommends a couple weeks of anti-
inflammatory medication, coupled with keeping your knee elevated, followed
by several weeks of physical therapy. Only then can you make a slow transi-
tion back to your normal activities.
180
Part IV: Helping Yourself 

Recovering from a major mood episode requires a similar approach, in which
you first stabilize your medications and moods and then slowly transition
back to your normal activities. To prevent relapse and ensure a smooth tran-
sition, make sure you meet or exceed all criteria in the following checklist:
 Your medications are stable.
 Your moods are stable. (You may not be the best judge of your mood
stability. Rely on your support group, doctor, and therapist for more
objective feedback.)
 You’re getting sufficient sleep.
 You’re thinking clearly.
 Your support group is in place.
 Your doctor/therapist believes you’re ready.
Don’t divorce your spouse, quit your job, or make any other major life deci-
sions while your moods are unstable. Mania, depression, and anxiety can
often push you to make rash decisions you later regret.
Returning to friends and family
A mood episode doesn’t always physically remove you from your family and
friends, but it does almost always drive a wedge between you and your loved
ones in some way. Mania can dramatically damage relationships, especially if
it contributes to acts of infidelity, physical or verbal abuse, overspending, or
substance abuse. Depression harms a relationship in more subtle ways — by
diminishing energy and the ability to show affection. If the depression leads
to a suicide attempt, it can make other family members feel guilty, inade-
quate, or embittered.
The first step is to stop beating yourself up over whatever may have unfolded
during the mood episode. Sure, you’re ultimately responsible for your words
and actions, but you’re not responsible for the mood episode that enabled
you to say and do the things you said and did. The next step is to encourage
everyone to work together; this is the tough part, because it takes under-
standing, empathy, and the ability to forgive and forget.
To build understanding and empathy and to enable forgiveness, take the fol-
lowing steps:
1. Find out how you may have hurt each person in your family, 
and apologize.
It’s natural to be unaware that you hurt someone and how you hurt that
person, especially during a mood episode.
181
Chapter 11: Healing at Your Own Pace

2. Encourage family members and friends to learn more about bipolar
disorder.
The more they know, the easier it is for them to understand that bipolar
disorder isn’t a product of your volition. Chapter 6 provides a list of
informative sources.
3. Involve family members in your therapy to a degree that you and they
feel comfortable.
Chapter 8 provides details of how family therapy can help.
4. Give family members specific instructions on how they can help sup-
port you.
By becoming involved, family members often feel empowered rather
than victimized.
You may meet some resistance from family members or friends who feel as
though you have somehow victimized them. What they need to realize is that
bipolar disorder has victimized your entire circle, and you most of all. You’re
doing your part by seeking treatment, managing your medications, and
attending therapy sessions. Now it’s their turn to step up and contribute.
When you apologize for something you said or did, accepting the apology is
entirely up to the other person. By taking responsibility and offering your
apology, you’ve done all you can do. If the person doesn’t accept your
attempts, you may need to let it go.
Dusting off your briefcase 
and returning to work
Is your job making you sick? Do you break out in hives just thinking about
returning to the daily grind? Is your boss a self-serving control freak? If so,
returning to your old job may not be conducive to your mental health. But if
you hacked away at your old job for 20 years, you may be reluctant to change
careers at this stage in your life. What do you do?
Weighing your options
You must first look at and evaluate your options. They basically boil down to
the following three:
 Return to work. Return to your job just as if you had never left. If you
have a low-stress job, this may be the perfect solution, but if your job is
a major stressor, this option carries significant risk.
 Work the system. Return to work on your terms, taking full advantage of
your rights as an employee. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act
182
Part IV: Helping Yourself 

(ADA), your employer is legally obligated to provide you with reasonable
accommodations. Reasonable means that the accommodations don’t
cost the company too much or require excessive adjustments. In other
words, you may be pushing your luck by requesting a new supervisor,
but time off for doctor’s appointments, a more structured work sched-
ule, additional training, fewer hours, and additional time to complete
tasks are all reasonable requests.
Under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), you can take up to 12
weeks’ unpaid leave with health coverage each year (you still have to
pay your portion of the health insurance premiums). For details about
your rights, turn to Chapter 13.
 Cut and run. Quit your job, and find a new one. If you choose this
option, be fully aware of what you risk losing: a stable income, the per-
sonal satisfaction that comes with being productive, a portion of your
retirement, built-up sick days or vacation time, and so on. Also, if you
quit, you may not be eligible for unemployment or disability benefits. If
you’re considering jumping ship, refer to Chapter 13 for information on
restructuring your life and finding rewarding work.
Consult your doctor and therapist before quitting a job to make sure you’re
not making your decision when your moods are cycling. Also, before you
make a final decision, list all the benefits and drawbacks of your current job
so you can accurately assess the cost-to-benefit ratio of quitting.
Returning to work with (the greatest of possible) ease
Assuming you decide to return to the job you had at the time of your most
recent mood episode, here are a few suggestions to help ease the transition
back to work:
 Meet with your doctor before your return. You may need a doctor’s
release to return to work. In addition, your doctor may offer some 
helpful suggestions concerning how to handle your medications in 
the workplace.
 Set up a doctor’s appointment for the end of your first work week. By
setting up an appointment in advance, you can return to work knowing
that if anything goes wrong, you can get in to see your doctor soon.
 Discuss your return with your supervisor. You’re not required by law to
disclose your diagnosis or treatment, but if you feel comfortable disclos-
ing this information, it may make your supervisor a little more under-
standing and flexible. If you request reasonable accommodations under
the ADA, you must disclose the reasons why you need special accommo-
dations. Your employer can’t fire you for having bipolar disorder.
You can often predict how your supervisor may react to your diagnosis
by thinking back to actions he performed or words he uttered in the past.
How accommodating has your supervisor been regarding other illnesses
183
Chapter 11: Healing at Your Own Pace

and absences from work? Has he ever made unkind remarks about
people who were “nutjobs” or “headcases” on the job? Look for clues
from the past.
 Discuss your return with one or more coworkers you trust. Again, you
have no obligation to disclose your diagnosis or treatment. In fact, a dis-
closure may not always be the best idea. But if you have coworkers you
trust, a support person on the job can help you watch for early warning
signs and avoid potential conflicts.
You may need to submit medical forms and other paperwork to receive sick
pay or other benefits, but keeping up on all the paperwork can be quite
stressful and difficult when you’re feeling depressed or overwhelmed. Get
help from a family member or friend, a union representative, or your
employer’s human resource department. Union representatives and HR work-
ers are typically very knowledgeable about your rights and dedicated to
making sure that your employer follows the proper legal procedures.
Facing your financial frets
Money can’t buy happiness, but excessive debt can purchase a warehouse
full of misery that visits almost everyone who suffers from bipolar disorder.
Expenses stemming from missed work, medical costs, and therapy quickly
add up. Roll in the cost of that Lamborghini you purchased during your last
manic episode, and you have all the makings of a financial Molotov cocktail.
Taking control of your money and your debt
Facing your financial problems and solving them require determination, disci-
pline, and at least a few of the following techniques and tips:
 Budgeting: List your sources of income and your expenses so you know
how much money is coming in, how much is going out, and where it’s
going. When you get organized, start cutting expenses. Chapter 13 offers
some tips on trimming expenses and simplifying your life.
 Limiting credit card use: Cut up your credit cards, or at least most of
them. Call your credit card companies, and lower your credit limit. Allow
a friend or relative to take your credit cards, debit card, and checkbook
when you begin to cycle.
 Consolidating debt: You may be able to roll all your personal debt into a
single account so you have only one payment to make per month.
However, depending on your situation and the debt consolidation com-
pany you use, this may cost you more in the long run.
184
Part IV: Helping Yourself 

Before you choose a debt consolidation company or credit counselor, ask
your bank, credit union, family, and friends for referrals. Many companies,
even those that advertise as not-for-profit, charge exorbitant fees. For
more information about finding legitimate organizations, check out the
Federal Trade Commission’s Web site at www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/
pubs/credit/fiscal.htm.
 Finding affordable healthcare: Chapter 20 provides a list of 10 ways to
save money on treatment and find affordable health insurance for you
and your family.
 Filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy: With Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the govern-
ment takes most of your belongings, except for exempt property (such
as your pension), which varies from state to state. It sells your stuff,
divides the money up among the people you owe, and then forgives you
any remaining debt. You can file Chapter 7 bankruptcy only once every
six years.
 Filing Chapter 13 bankruptcy: Chapter 13 bankruptcy generally lets you
keep your home and car, assuming you can make the monthly payments.
The state requires you to pay monthly installments to pay off a reason-
able portion of your debt over a three- to five-year period, after which
any remaining debt is forgiven.
Bankruptcy remains on your record for up to 10 years, fouling up your credit
rating and making it difficult to secure loans.
Handing control of your finances to someone else
In extreme cases, you can relinquish control of your finances and other
important matters to a trusting friend or relative through the courts:
 Power of attorney allows a friend or relative to make legal and financial
decisions for you when you’re physically or mentally incapacitated.
 Legal guardianship enables a relative to act as your guardian, making
that person responsible for your health and well-being.
 Financial guardianship: If you’ve had many manic episodes and are left
with limited resources that must last the rest of your life, you may be
able to seek financial guardianship. Some financial institutions will
create guardianships for people with illnesses even if they don’t meet
the institution’s usual minimum for such services.
Giving a trusted relative power of attorney or legal guardianship strips you of
much of your freedom and legal rights and can often lead to bitter feelings.
Make the decision only when your moods are stable, and choose a person
whom you completely trust to do what’s best for you.
185
Chapter 11: Healing at Your Own Pace

Locking up your legal issues
People rarely break the law during spells of depression. They may do some
uncharacteristic things, like leaving a stack of dirty dishes in the sink or
frowning at Disneyland, but nothing that calls for jail time. Mania is depres-
sion’s evil twin, the insidious instigator who tugs on your puppet strings and
encourages you to perform all manner of lewd and immoral acts. It handcuffs
and gags your conscience, so you act without inhibitions. Sure, a manic state
can make you more spontaneous and creative, but it can also push you past
the boundaries of what’s socially acceptable and legal.
If you get caught breaking the law, the legal system can complicate your life
and increase your stress level by subjecting you to court dates, legal fees,
fines, parole officers, and possibly even jail time. You rarely have the option
of whether or not to deal with these inconveniences, but you may be able to
diminish the negative effects they have on your life. Here are a few suggestions:
 Keep quiet. When you’re manic, keeping your mouth shut may not be a
realistic option, but it’s always good advice to defer to your lawyer when
questioned. Remember, you do have the right to remain silent.
 Obtain legal representation. You have the right to a court-appointed
attorney if you can’t afford a private attorney. You can also seek help
from advocacy groups. NAMI (National Alliance for the Mentally Ill) 
has a legal center you can contact by calling 703-524-7600 or e-mailing
legal@nami.org.
 Inform the court of your bipolar diagnosis. Lawyers, judges, social
workers, and correctional officers should be well aware of the effects
mania has on behavior, and they may be more flexible knowing that
you’ve been diagnosed and are receiving treatment.
 Add your parole officer to your treatment team. If the court assigns
you a parole officer, encourage communication between the parole offi-
cer and your doctor and therapist. In addition to fostering understand-
ing and empathy, the team effort can assist in your recovery.
 Seek assistance with any substance-abuse problems. Alcohol and illicit
drugs can often exacerbate mood symptoms and lead to illicit behavior.
If you have a substance-abuse problem, make sure your doctor and ther-
apist know about it. Alcoholics Anonymous and other support groups
can help you stay clean and sober.
If you need to call the police to deal with a friend or relative who’s currently
suffering a major manic attack, inform the dispatcher that the person has
bipolar disorder. Most officers are trained to confront an alleged perpetrator
directly, which is the worst approach for dealing with someone experiencing
full-blown mania. NAMI and other organizations are working hard to train police
on how to defuse tense situations and get mentally ill people to treatment
186
Part IV: Helping Yourself 

rather than to jail. If your friend or relative is arrested and jailed, officers
won’t allow the person to take medication, so you need to call the doctor and
perhaps a lawyer in order to convince the justice system to pass along the
medications to your friend or relative.
Dealing with Setbacks
The best strategy for maintaining your health is to follow your doctor’s
orders, reduce stress, and avoid any surprises that could throw off your
rhythm. If you adhere to this strategy, you’re likely to proceed for a much
longer time without experiencing symptoms than if you don’t make the
adjustments. However, being a “good little patient” doesn’t provide you with
a money-back guarantee that you’ll remain symptom free. In the real world,
variables, such as the following, can have a tremendous influence over the
course of the illness:
 Medicines can lose their effectiveness over time.
 Job changes can increase stress.
 Family events and crises can trigger mood fluctuations.
 Other health problems can cause mood swings.
Knowing that setbacks are normal helps keep them in perspective so you
don’t feel as though your treatment has failed when something goes wrong.
The key is to remain vigilant, identify problems as early as possible, and
address those problems quickly and aggressively:
 Monitor your moods. Keep track of your moods, and note any signifi-
cant changes, as we explain in Chapter 12. As soon as you notice a
change, meet with your doctor or therapist.
 Meet regularly with your doctor. Review your medications with your
doctor every few months — more frequently if you’re just recovering
from a mood episode or your doctor has recently adjusted your 
medications.
 Meet regularly with your therapist. Even when you’re stable, you
should visit regularly with your therapist. She’s your ally in monitoring
your moods and recognizing early warning signs. She can offer support
and strategies for all the issues in life that can trigger a mood cycle.
 Check in with your caregivers when you experience a major life
event. Meet with your doctor or therapist as soon as any stressful event
occurs — a job change, divorce, child moving away or back home, death
of a loved one — even if you think you can handle it just fine.

ant to try an explosive experiment? Seal a pot of water good and tight,
set it on the stove, and crank up the heat. In a matter of minutes, your
pot will blow its lid. The same is true with people. Although each person has
a different boiling point and can handle varying amounts of pressure, if you
apply enough heat without providing some way for the pressure to escape,
everyone will either explode or implode. Pressure always finds a release — 
in the form of anger or violence, a flurry of activity, a depressive meltdown,
or some other discharge of pent-up energy and angst.
Medication regulates your mind’s reaction to stressful events and raises your
internal boiling point, but it can’t reduce or eliminate the heat — the external
sources of stress. Tense situations, personal conflicts, unresolved family mat-
ters, and even major shifts in your daily routine all contribute stress that can
eventually upset the sensitive balance of your moods.
Of course, you can’t eliminate all the stress in your life (nor would you proba-
bly want to), but you can identify the major stressors and mood triggers and
remove or reduce the effects of enough of them to keep the pressure at a
manageable level.
This chapter empowers you to rid your environment of the events, conflicts,
and structure-busters that commonly aggravate moods. Here, you find out
how to identify the main stressors and triggers in your life and begin to
address them. We show you how to monitor your moods, energy levels, and
sleep patterns. And we help you build an early warning system so you can
react to depression and mania before they take control.

Pinpointing (and Dealing with) 
Your Stressors and Triggers
What makes you tick? What ticks you off? What makes the back of your neck
tingle? What inspires your deepest passion, enables you to forgo meals and
sleep, and drives you to lose track of self and time?
If you’re like most people, you haven’t given such questions much thought.
And if you didn’t have bipolar disorder, you could live the rest of your life in
blissful ignorance of the answers. But because you have bipolar disorder, you
have a responsibility to yourself to become aware of your environment and
the factors that influence your emotions and moods.
People, places, jobs, events, seasons, and even holidays can play a significant
role in your mood stability. By identifying your mood triggers and the primary
sources of stress in your life, you can begin to remove them, or at least dimin-
ish the toxic effects they have on your moods. This section initiates the identifi-
cation process by describing some of the more common stressors and triggers.
Your job
Your job can be an obvious source of stress, especially if you’re overworked,
underpaid, and have a knucklehead for a supervisor. But your work can be
just as tense if it features some of the following, more subtle, characteristics:
 Monotonous: Although routine can be comforting, too much of a good
thing can become tedious. Breaking up your work day with variations in
activity may be what you need.
 Cushy: An easy job can be just as stressful as one that’s too demand-
ing, especially if your mind tends to turn on itself when you don’t chal-
lenge it.
 Unrewarding: Working for money and benefits is perfectly acceptable,
but at some point in your life, you may find that money isn’t enough. You
feel like you really need to do something you believe in.
 Noisy: Loud machinery, music, or talking can be unnerving, especially if
you’re ultrasensitive to sounds.
 Disruptive: Focused individuals often become anxious and frustrated
when interrupted. For example, a teacher who’s very detail oriented
may find interruptions from students nerve racking.
190
Part IV: Helping Yourself 

 Deadline-focused: Deadlines often present goals that motivate some
people and improve moods, but tight deadlines may increase anxiety.
 Irregular hours: Alternating shifts and irregular work hours are hard on
everybody but potentially toxic to someone with bipolar disorder.
 Unpredictable: When your workload can change at a moment’s notice —
emergency room nursing, for example — the adrenaline surges can be a
real drain on the nervous system.
 Constrained: Responsibility without the necessary power and resources
is a formula for failure and chronic stress.
Only you can decide whether or not the benefits of your job outweigh the
drawbacks, but if you find that you can’t perform your job or that any
attempts to return to work result in a major mood episode, you should seri-
ously consider your alternatives. As we discuss in Chapter 13, under the
Americans with Disabilities Act, you can ask for reasonable accommodations
to enable you to successfully perform your job duties. If that doesn’t work,
consider changing jobs or filing for disability. Staying in a job that aggravates
your illness is rarely the best choice. Chapter 13 provides some suggestions
for finding and securing a job that’s more conducive to your mental health.
Lover quarrels
When a steamy romance morphs into a cauldron of conflict, the bipolar brain
begins to boil. And what’s most startling, perhaps, is that the bipolar brain
often seeks out conflict in order to feed its insatiable appetite for stimulation.
To compound the problem, bipolar disorder tends to trigger relationship
trouble and then that trouble in turn aggravates the illness.
In romantic relationships, several elements often contribute to producing the
ideal setting for conflict:
 Loss of interest in sex, sometimes as a result of antidepressants and
other medications
 Increased sexual desire, making the person seem sexually insatiable or
leading the person to seek sexual gratification elsewhere
 Inability to show affection
 Lack of interest in anything
 Lack of desire to socialize
 Inability to have fun
191
Chapter 12: Identifying Your Triggers and Mapping Your Moods

 Overspending
 Inability to work
 Refusal to adhere to treatment plan
 Desire for conflict
 Avoidance of any conflict
Just because your partner has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder doesn’t
mean that you can blame every disagreement on the disorder. You and your
partner can expect to have differences of opinion; you are, after all, two dif-
ferent people. However, because heated arguments can significantly affect
moods, you need to work on keeping the intensity down and resolving your
differences as quickly, rationally, and completely as possible. Chapter 16 offers
additional suggestions on supporting a loved one with bipolar disorder.
Couples therapy can often help you and your partner develop the communi-
cation and problem-solving skills you need to keep disagreements from spin-
ning out of control. See Chapter 8 for details.
Family fiascos
Families are as unique as the individuals who comprise them. Some families
are so calm they seem comatose. Others resemble ant farms, in which every
family member busily carries out an assigned chore. And some are so com-
petitive that you wonder if they fit the dictionary definition of “family” (which
includes some clause about shared goals and values). Every family has prob-
lems, but when personality conflicts and other issues become insurmount-
able and trigger mood episodes, you need to recognize the risks to your
mental health and take action:
 Identify and resolve issues as a family. The faster you identify and
resolve conflict, the less effect it has on all family members, especially
those who suffer most in the presence of emotional instability. If your
family can’t resolve a serious issue on its own, you need to look into the
next option.
 Seek family counseling, if necessary. Family counseling improves the
overall understanding of bipolar disorder, increases support from family
members, and enhances communication skills, as discussed in Chapter 8.
 Limit family contact, if all other options fail. If your family refuses to
learn more about bipolar disorder and make necessary adjustments to
aid in your recovery, you may need to limit family contact. Don’t martyr
yourself for the good of the family.
192
Part IV: Helping Yourself 

Be aware of others in the family who may have bipolar disorder or something
similar. When multiple people in the family have symptoms, the fallout is
often even more damaging.
Happy (?) holidays
For many people who suffer from psychiatric illnesses, the holidays deliver a
double dose of dysfunction: They disrupt a carefully structured routine and
frequently place you in contact with family members, some of whom may be
quite irritating. Planning for the holidays requires that you strategically pre-
pare for your holiday survival and remain committed to:
 Sticking to your established schedule
 Adhering to your treatment plan
 Avoiding tense situations
If you know that a particular holiday or season destabilizes your moods, plan
ahead for it. Your doctor may recommend a short-term medication adjust-
ment or a limited prescription for a sedative. In addition, you may want to
limit the amount of time you spend on the road or with your extended family.
If you usually host the holiday celebration and find it stressful, you should
plan on celebrating at the home of another friend or relative.
Jet lag can seriously disrupt sleep-wake cycles and cause problems with
mood cycles and medications. Consult your doctor about how to manage
meds if you have to cross time zones. Avoid the temptation to self-medicate
with alcohol or sedatives. Your doctor may prescribe sleep medicine to assist
with your adjustment to the new time zone if he thinks the transition may be
too stressful.
Mood-altering people
Instinctively, you avoid your most annoying acquaintances, but some pests
may be unavoidable, and others may alter your moods in less noticeable ways.
An old high school buddy, for example, may influence you to overindulge in
alcohol or party too late. One of your children may test your patience with
passive-aggressive behavior. Perhaps a parent or other authority figure chips
away at your self-esteem with subtle innuendos or “good-hearted” teasing.
The world is only so big, so you probably can’t avoid all the annoying and
hurtful people in the world. If you identify who they are and what they say
193
Chapter 12: Identifying Your Triggers and Mapping Your Moods

and do to irritate you, however, you can begin to take control of how you feel
in their presence. After you identify the source of the problem, you have sev-
eral options, including the following:
 Blow it off. If the person is of little consequence, and you’re pretty sure
he doesn’t care about how you feel, why should you care? Admittedly,
letting it go is easier said than done.
 Open up. Describe to the person how what he says or does affects you.
This reveals the negative effects of his words or actions and is often
enough to make him stop. People can’t argue with how you feel, so
express your feelings as “I” statements — for example, “I feel like a fail-
ure as a parent when you criticize my children.”
 Ask the person to stop. If you tell the pest that something he says or
does hurts you in some way, and he continues behaving and speaking in
the same manner, ask him to stop.
 Attach a consequence. In other words, if the person doesn’t stop, what
do you plan to do about it? Pick something realistic and not too terribly
cruel — perhaps simply leaving the room. Don’t offer an ultimatum
unless you’re fully prepared to carry it out.
Clashing temperaments
The Odd Couple made great humor out of the temperamental mismatching of
neat-freak Felix Unger and his slob of a roommate Oscar Madison, but such
pairings in real life result more often in tragedy than comedy. Each person is
born with a unique temperament that remains consistent through the course
of a lifetime. When temperaments click, the meetings often result in deep and
lasting friendships. When they don’t, the confrontations can wreak havoc on
personal relationships, work interactions, and student–teacher connections.
Certain temperamental traits, including the following, are more prone to
create friction:
 Tempo: Each person has an identifiable tempo. Some people thrive in
high gear all the time, and others proceed at a more measured pace.
 Intensity: Energy levels shift a great deal, but everyone has a baseline
intensity level that you can usually detect when a person enters the
room. Some people are dynamos, beaming heat and electricity, and
other individuals may be low-wattage types, generating a cooler, less-
concentrated light.
 Need for order: People seem wired to be either slobs or neatniks — at
least to some degree. You may be totally oblivious to the stacks of cloth-
ing lying on the floor, but your wife notices every speck of dust in a
room. Humans can be trained somewhat, but natural tendencies are
stubborn and resist change.
194
Part IV: Helping Yourself 

 Need for predictability and consistency: Some people need their lives
to remain pretty much the same on a day-to-day basis. They plan for the
future and take the steps necessary to execute their plans and achieve
their desired outcomes. Others throw all caution to the wind and go
with the flow. They ride life’s ups and downs like surfers ride waves.
Each approach has its benefits and risks, but trying to get two people
with opposite tendencies to work together can be a nightmare.
 Social style: Look around the room at the next party you attend, and
you’ll see variations in social styles that range from garrulous extrovert
to mousy introvert. Although neither style is right or wrong, better or
worse, differences in social style and one’s desired amount of social con-
tact are a common source of relationship conflict.
 Reactivity: You may get frustrated with your husband’s lukewarm
response to your headline news, but his internal reactor may be wired a
little differently. People vary greatly in how quickly (or not) their emo-
tional charges get juiced up. People with bipolar disorder tend to land in
the more reactive end of the spectrum.
Remember that temperamental differences are just that: differences. One
style isn’t inherently superior. Tolerance for someone else’s innate way of
being can reduce most conflicts. Big temperamental differences can be diffi-
cult to negotiate, but awareness of these issues is a good start to navigating
situations that may otherwise create enormous stress.
Uncomfortable situations
Do you go ballistic waiting in your doctor’s office? When you stop at a gas
station for a fill-up and find out that your pump is prepay? When some joker
at the table next to you lights up a stogie? Situations such as these are often
unavoidable, so the most effective way to deal with them is to change your
thinking and behavior toward them, which can be quite a challenge. Chapter
8 explains ways to alter your thinking patterns through cognitive behavioral
therapy. If the source of your discomfort involves an annoying person, and
changing your thinking isn’t an option, skip back to the previous two sections
for some advice.
Downtime
Moods often ride waves of activity. When you have plans and the resources
to carry them out, you often feel motivated and energized. Without plans, or
without a reason to wake up in the morning, you may feel lost. Perhaps this is
why so many people with bipolar disorder experience their first major mood
episode in college, when frenetic finals are followed by extended breaks.
195
Chapter 12: Identifying Your Triggers and Mapping Your Moods

If periods of downtime make you feel depressed, try to avoid downtime by
planning more carefully, regulating your workload, and looking for rewarding
activities. Here are some suggestions to get you started:
 Schedule your days. Plan ahead for tomorrow so you go to bed knowing
that you have specific tasks to accomplish the next day. This allows you
to wake up with a purpose.
 Schedule your weeks. You don’t have to pack your week full of activi-
ties, but plan one or two special activities so you have something to look
forward to.
 Plan a project. If you have a project around the house or even outside
your home that will take at least a couple days and possibly require
some extra supplies, start planning for it. This often provides just the
motivation you need to start executing your plan.

Developing temperamental tolerance
Maggie worked at a television station and loved
every minute of it. She was up at the crack of
dawn every day and never stopped moving until
she crashed into bed at night. Her husband, Hal,
was slightly less energetic, but he worked at a
similar pace. Together, they adopted Sam at
birth. He was a loving, gentle baby with big
brown eyes, but as Sam grew, he puzzled them.
They scheduled plenty of exciting activities for
him — baseball, music lessons, rock climbing,
and astronomy classes. They wanted him to
have everything, see everything, and do every-
thing. But Sam would have none of it. He
protested every trip to the hockey rink and every
round of tennis. He fussed and sometimes even
exploded when it was time to go anywhere. He
liked to stay home reading, coloring, watching
TV, or playing with blocks. He rested a lot and
enjoyed quiet “thinking time,” as he called it.
Maggie and Hal cajoled, they wheedled, they
screamed, and they threatened, but nothing
changed.
When Sam was 13, he was diagnosed with bipo-
lar disorder. Therapists and doctors explained to
the family that their high-intensity demands
often triggered Sam’s explosiveness; to suc-
cessfully manage his bipolar disorder, this cycle
had to stop. The emotional intensity was creat-
ing more and more mood episodes for him.
Maggie and Hal were devastated. They kept
thinking that more activity would help Sam’s
bipolar disorder, but it kept backfiring. When dis-
cussing this with his doctor, they were told that
Sam probably had a different temperament —
different tempo and energy patterns — than
they did. They were stunned to imagine that
other people and families in the world didn’t
operate at their level of activity. When they real-
ized that his temperament wasn’t a bad thing,
but a different way of being, they began to feel
less anxious about his low energy and instead
learned to use it as part of his life structure to
minimize mood episodes.

 Plan an outing. Do you like to camp? Go to the theater? Take rides in the
country? The anticipation of a pleasant activity can often lift you out of
the doldrums.
 Create a to-do list. You don’t need a Martha Stewart to-do list, but
having a few things jotted down helps structure your day.
 Set a realistic goal. A simple goal, such as walking outside for 10 min-
utes a day, can give you something specific to do and provide you with a
sense of accomplishment.
 Take up a hobby. What do you like to do even when you don’t get paid
to do it? Paint? Write? Sew? Build model airplanes? It doesn’t have to be
an expensive hobby, just something you enjoy doing on a regular basis.
Chapter 13 provides additional suggestions for achieving mood stability by
restructuring your life.
Monitoring Your Moods
Every few years, mood rings become “the thing.” When you slide one over
your finger, you can glance at the colors throughout the day to determine if
you’re happy or sad, angry or calm, passionate or indifferent. Too bad the
rings don’t work, because if they did, they would be great accessories for
people with bipolar disorder. One look at the ring would tell you whether
your moods are stable or if you’re on the verge of a nervous breakdown. You
could even get a mood dot to stick on your forehead like a Hindu bindi to let
others know when to back off.
Until mood rings are perfected, however, you must rely on your perceptions
and charting expertise to monitor your moods. Mood monitoring offers the
following benefits:
 Increases your awareness of your moods and fluctuations
 Functions as an early warning system against impending mood episodes
 Records the affects of medication adjustments on moods
Figure 12-1 provides a sample mood chart that enables you to record your
mood for each day on a scale of “Who Cares?” (extremely down) to “Yeehaa!”
(extremely up), with “Groovy” as your baseline or normal mood level. Simply
place an X in the box that best represents your overall mood level for each day.
The notes area at the bottom provides space for you to log any medication
changes or significant events that may affect your moods on any given day.

Part IV: Helping Yourself 

Share your mood charts with your doctor and therapist. The information
your charts provide can help tremendously in identifying your stressors and
triggers, managing your medications, and tracking the success of your treat-
ment. When your doctor or therapist asks you how you’ve been doing since
your last appointment, you can provide concrete data.
Charting Your Sleep Patterns 
and Energy Levels
A mood chart (see the previous section) contains subjective data; it provides
a record of how you perceive your moods during any given day. But as people
with bipolar disorder know, you can’t always trust your perceptions. A mood
rating of “Zooey” may indicate that you’re feeling only a little high, even though
you’re not sleeping and you’re beginning to exhibit manic symptoms. You can
often obtain a more objective measure of your moods by charting your sleep
patterns and energy levels — how much sleep you’re getting, when you’re
getting it, and how energetic you feel.
Figure 12-2 provides a sleep log you can use to track your sleep data and energy
levels. Simply mark the hours you sleep each day, including naps, and record
your energy level for that day on a scale of –5 to +5. (You may find that your
energy level is pretty much in line with your overall mood rating for the day.)
The notes area provides space for you to log any medication changes or sig-
nificant events that may affect your moods.
Your sleep log can help you identify early warning signs and patterns that
you may need to attend to for optimum mood stability. At the end of each
day, examine your sleep log for the following patterns and warning signs:
 Increasing need for sleep: If you have an increasing need for sleep, and
your energy levels are sinking, your mood may be on the downswing.
 Decreasing need for sleep: If your energy levels are climbing, even
though you’re getting less and less sleep, you may be working yourself
up to a manic episode.
 Variations in sleep patterns: Are you sleeping in on weekends? Taking
long naps during the day? Unable to sleep when you normally go to bed?
If so, you may need to work on regulating your sleep patterns. Sleep reg-
ulation is one of the primary goals of interpersonal and social rhythm
therapy (IPSRT), which we discuss in Chapter 8.
Significant changes in your sleep patterns and energy levels can be a sign of
an impending mood episode. If you’re having trouble falling asleep or sleep-
ing through the night, refer to Chapter 13 for suggestions.

Logging Confrontations
How many arguments did you have this week? And the week before that? Your
answers can warn you about a looming mood episode or simply point to the
fact that you happened to lock horns with some really annoying people during
the last couple of weeks. After all, your sister doesn’t know how to raise her
kids, and your boss needs to bone up on his people-management skills.
But placing blame isn’t your goal here. You just need to determine an accu-
rate fight count and intensity level for comparison purposes. That way, if you
usually have one or two minor disagreements a week, and the number sud-
denly jumps to five or six major blow-ups, you can easily tell that you may be
becoming a little more sensitive or irritable. And telling yourself you’re being
a little more sensitive and irritable is certainly less irritating than hearing it
from someone else.
You can log your confrontations in any number of places, including 
the following:
 Your personal calendar or day planner
 In the notes area on your mood chart (see Figure 12-1)
 In the notes area on your sleep log (see Figure 12-2)
 In your journal
Consider using a secret code or color and marking the intensity of the alter-
cation on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being mildly upset, 3 indicating the use of
insults and foul language, and 5 being all-out war.

Chapter 12: Identifying Your Triggers and Mapping Your Moods
Can sleep deprivation cure depression?
Can you sleep-deprive your way out of a
depressed episode? Some researchers think
that it may be possible. Using a technique called
TSD (total sleep deprivation), researchers sub-
jected depressed bipolar patients to three
cycles of sleep deprivation, each consisting of a
36-hour period of sleeplessness followed by a
12-hour sleep-in. After the sessions, over half
the participants reported feeling less depressed.
The trouble is, TSD runs about a 10 percent risk
of kicking a bipolar sufferer into hypomania or
mania — about the same rate as SSRI antide-
pressants. In addition, the positive effects of
TSD generally wear off as soon as you return to
your normal sleep/wake cycle. Researchers
continue to study the potential benefits of TSD
when used in combination with other therapies,
but the only solid conclusion that researchers
have reached is that TSD is definitely not some-
thing you should try on your own.

Keeping a Journal
When most people hear the term “journal,” they think “diary” — an honest
description of events, feelings, perceptions, and impressions. As such, jour-
naling can be very therapeutic, especially if you have nothing to hide and
nobody to hide it from. For the less fortunate, journaling is the equivalent of
offering up a full confession to the state prosecutor. Sure, you can log your
feelings and perceptions, but unless you’re sure that you can keep other
prying eyes out of your journal, you probably don’t want a written record of
your thoughts and feelings on public display.
For the purpose of tracking moods, medications, and other data, your journal
need not be so personal. A daily entry can contain the following details:
 Medication adjustment
 Missed medications
 Overall mood rating
 Amount of sleep you obtained
 Special activities or events
 Whether or not you exercised
 Recent problems or resolved issues
Of course, if you want to take a more personal approach, we encourage you
to do so. Journaling enables you to express your thoughts and feelings with-
out fear of negative repercussions. It provides you with a way to look back on
how you were feeling and what you were thinking at a specific point in time,
which allows you to witness your progress and development as a person.
And it can help you identify recurring issues that are calling out for your
attention. You can hand-write your journal, type it as a document in your
word processor, or even use a tape player to narrate it.
Many people choose to share their journals online in the form of a blog. Blog
is short for Web log — a Web page that typically contains a daily record of an
individual’s thoughts, feelings, observations, insights, and whatever else the
person wants to spill on a page. A couple of good places to learn the ropes are
Blogger, at www.blogger.com, and LiveJournal, at www.livejournal.com.

Restructuring Your Life
In This Chapter
 Reassessing your commitments
 Getting in a healthier groove
 Hooking up with supportive friends and relatives
 Latching on to a rewarding career path
W
hen you survive a major mood episode, receive your bipolar badge,
and begin effective treatments, the whole experience can scrub the
sleep out of your eyes and impart a clarity of vision. It can burn away all the
petty, insignificant nonsense in life and reveal what’s really important. The
experience plasters a big red arrow on your lifeline that says “YOU ARE
HERE,” and that’s all that really matters.
You can now measure your life in eras: BBD (Before Bipolar Diagnosis) and
ABD (After Bipolar Diagnosis). The BBD era is over. All your past mistakes
and indiscretions instigated by your bipolar disorder are finished. You may
have to deal with some fallout and aftershocks, but the words and deeds are
done, and you can’t do anything to undo them. Nor can you get rid of your
condition. Some of your old dreams may be finished, too. You may not be
able to retire at 50 or take a year off work to explore the Amazon rainforests.
Now is ABD time. You’re a different person. You’ve been reborn in a way, bap-
tized by fire. Your current situation is different — not better or worse, just
changed. After a period of mourning for the passing of your old self, you may
find this time somewhat liberating. It provides an opportunity to start anew —
to reinvent yourself, create a life that’s both more manageable and rewarding,
and paint new dreamscapes.
That’s what this chapter is all about. Here, we lead you through the process
of determining what’s really important. We assist you in identifying and strip-
ping away the trivial, irrelevant gunk that muddles your life. Finally, we provide
suggestions on how to restructure your life in a way that helps you maintain
your mental health and achieve a meaningful, rewarding existence.

Budgeting Your Time and Resources
People tend to accumulate stuff. We fill our houses with furniture and appli-
ances, our budgets with expenses, our calendars with appointments, and our
free time with commitments. Occasionally, we clean house to remove a few
broken and nonessential items, and when finances get tight, we examine our
budgets to trim discretionary spending. But few of us budget our time and
resources. Have you ever sat down and figured out where you’re spending your
time? Have you tabulated your energy expenditures? Perhaps you should.
Time and resources, like money, tend to trickle away unless you keep track of
where and how you spend them. And now that you’ve been diagnosed with
bipolar disorder, you need to manage your time and resources more carefully
so you have enough left for yourself and your friends and family, as well as
for doctors’ appointments, therapy, and support groups.
Re-allocating your time
If you feel like you’re under a constant time crunch, go back to Chapter 8, 
and use the form there to record your daily schedule for the week. Better yet,
make four copies, and track your schedule over the course of a month. Take a
highlighter and mark any discretionary time expenditures. Be on the lookout
for the following flab:
 Television time
 Video-game playing
 Internet access, including e-mail, chat, and instant messaging
 Unnecessary telephone time
After highlighting potential time-wasting activities, you can begin to trim the
fat to free up time you can invest in more productive and rewarding endeav-
ors, such as problem solving, date nights, weekend outings, and exercise.
Downtime is an essential part of a healthy mental diet, so don’t eliminate
time-wasting activities altogether. Clear out excessive wastes of time, but
keep a few mindless interludes to remain refreshed. Just as you have to allow
for a few indulgences in a financial budget to reward yourself for sticking to
it, you dangle some mental “treats” in front of your nose to help you adhere
to your time-management plan.
204
Part IV: Helping Yourself 

Another way to overcome time-crunch issues is to pay yourself first, as finan-
cial advisors often recommend to clients concerning their investments.
Consider that you have 168 hours a week, and calculate from there:
168 hours a week
– 56 hours for sleep (8 hours a day)
– 44 hours for work (40, plus commuting time and so on)
– 30 hours for household chores (cooking, cleaning, eating, paying bills)
= 38 free hours a week
Now take those 38 hours, and pay yourself and your loved ones first.
Whatever remains, you can blow on TV, movies, the Internet, volunteer work,
card games, or whatever else commands your interest.
Conserving your energy and resources
According to comedian George Carlin, at the end of the game of life, the guy
with the most stuff wins. That may be true, assuming you really like your stuff
and have the time and resources to maintain your belongings properly. But if
you try to maintain a lifestyle of the rich and famous on a Homer Simpson
budget, your mental health is likely to pay the bill.
Less is often more. You may be able to add to your life by subtracting from it,
thus saving time, money, and aggravation. The options for streamlining your
life are limited only by your imagination and commitment to change. When
negotiating lifestyle changes, consider everything that takes your time,
energy, and resources, including
 Home ownership
 Career
 Social commitments
 Kids’ sports and school activities
 Cars and other vehicles
 Pets
Focus not only on the costs of maintaining your lifestyle choices, but also on
the value they return to you. If the costs outweigh the values, you’ve identi-
fied prime candidates for trimming.
205
Chapter 13: Restructuring Your Life

Establishing Healthy Routines
Bipolar disorder thrives in an atmosphere in which it calls the shots. When
you’re depressed, it saps your energy, discourages you from visiting friends
and family, and keeps your hand hovering over your alarm clock’s snooze
button. When you’re manic, it revs your thoughts, lifts your inhibitions, and
instills a sense of omniscience and omnipotence or irritability and anger 
that can get you into trouble. In either case, bipolar disorder creates a self-
perpetuating, self-destructive mindset that typically discourages sufferers
from taking the necessary action to break the cycle.
By establishing healthy routines and making a commitment to stick to them,
you can take control and often prevent depression and mania from establish-
ing a foothold. If you’re committed to being in bed only eight hours a night

Perfecting imperfection
Nowadays, everyone needs to be perfect: the
super mom, the beauty queen, the sensitive male
hunk, the successful investor, the apprentice, the
swan. And if you don’t quite stack up to what
society and culture expect from you, you’d better
get to work. Head to your neighborhood book-
store, load up on all the self-help books and
videos you can carry, and pile on a few maga-
zines while you’re at it. And don’t forget to turn on
the television to get blasted with more messages
that you’re not good enough, smart enough, or
talented enough to make it. Our society and our
media glorify perfection, and people doggedly
pursue it, often to the point of self-destruction.
Families can’t just be made up of loving individu-
als who hang out together; they have to be
“amazing” and achieve some incredible goal. A
loving, available mom doesn’t quite make the cut
unless she has a hot body and the right clothes
and makeup to complete the package.
Learning to accept yourself, imperfections and
all, is the only key to achieving genuine satis-
faction and peace. People with bipolar disorder
discover more quickly than others that you can’t
keep trying to do more and be more. You have
to evaluate what you need to do and what you
love to do and then carefully sort through every-
thing else that gets piled onto your plate. The
word “no” must be become your mantra,
because people always ask you to do one more
“little” thing. If you’re a working mom, you prob-
ably can’t make it to every school function. If
your spouse has bipolar disorder, you may have
to decline a few dinner invitations. Maybe you
can’t have your children in organized sports
because you don’t have the time to get them
there. Perhaps you can’t take on a promotion
that will saddle you with ridiculous hours. Only
you can make these decisions and live with
them. But whatever you choose to do, don’t let
society define perfection and set unrealistic
goals for you. “Doing it all and doing it well” isn’t
a realistic option for most people, let alone
people with bipolar disorder.

and up and about the rest of the time, for example, no matter how you feel,
you may prevent some mood episodes or reduce the severity of them when
they do come. Your routines help keep the sleep and energy changes of
depression and mania down to a dull roar.
In this section, you find out how to regulate your sleep and schedule social
activities to gain more control over your moods.
Regulating your sleep
Show us a person with bipolar disorder, and we’ll show you a person who
sleeps too much, not enough, or not deeply enough. The disorder messes
with your sleep patterns, and your disrupted sleep patterns often aggravate
your moods. If you want to remain healthy, you need to get some sleep. The
following suggestions can help you establish a regular sleep schedule:
 Go to bed at the same time every day. Refer to Chapter 8 for sugges-
tions on how to build a structured schedule. People with bipolar disor-
der are commonly night owls, which is okay as long as you commit to a
specific bedtime each and every day.
 Wake up at the same time every day. Yes, even on Saturdays and Sundays.
 Don’t nap. Napping is like snacking: It can ruin your appetite for sleep.
 Don’t fight insomnia. Ordering yourself to sleep is usually counterpro-
ductive. Use some of the centering exercises in Chapter 8 to bring your
thoughts into the moment or engage in a quiet activity, such as reading.
 Avoid caffeine and other stimulants. Yeah, we know this is a duh! sug-
gestion, but you wouldn’t believe how many people who complain about
lack of sleep guzzle coffee or chain-smoke during the day. Sleep special-
ists say that any caffeine after noon influences your sleep. If you have
sleep problems, keep this in mind. Also avoid spicy foods, alcohol,
decongestants, and other enemies of sleep.
 Turn off the television. If you have a TV or computer in the bedroom,
consider moving it out. If you simply can’t miss an episode of your
favorite show, record it to watch later. If music helps you fall asleep,
great; otherwise, turn off the radio or CD player, too.
 Transition to sleep mode. Avoid all stimulating input for one full hour
before bedtime — phone calls, TV shows, work or schoolwork, and com-
puter activities are all stimulating. Reading, listening to quiet music, and
other soothing activities should be the only things you do for the hour
prior to bedtime.
207
Chapter 13: Restructuring Your Life

 Turn on a fan or other hummer. Monotonous noise, commonly 
referred to as white noise, helps some people sleep. It may also block 
out more disturbing noises, such as dogs barking, cars honking, or
neighbors bickering.
 Don’t exercise before bedtime. Unless, of course, you consider sex
exercise. If you don’t have a particular problem with being awake all
night after engaging in intimate acts with your significant other, intimacy
is usually encouraged. Regular exercise often acts as a stimulant, so try
moving exercise time to earlier in the day.
 Get family support. If your significant other begs you to stay up to watch
David Letterman, and your son tramps through the house at 1 a.m. 
trying to find something to eat, they aren’t doing much for your sleep
regulation. Everyone in the house needs to get on board. If your cat
jumps on your face in the middle of the night, you may need to do some-
thing about that, too.
 Work with your doctor. Ask about changing the time you take your med-
ications, adjusting dosages, or switching/adding medications to help
with sleep. If your medications don’t put you to sleep soon enough or
leave you groggy in the morning, you may need to take them earlier in
the evening.
The Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance is so aware of the mental health
benefits of regular sleep that it launched a campaign called “Sleepless in
America.” For more information, check out its Web site at www.sleepless
inamerica.org. The site provides some additional suggestions for getting a
restful night’s sleep.
Scheduling social activities
Remaining social as bipolar disorder ravages your life can be quite a chal-
lenge. When depressed, you may shun company. After a manic episode, you
may hesitate to mix it up with your usual circle of friends, especially if you
said or did something embarrassing during your last episode. However, forc-
ing yourself to maintain social contact on a regular basis often delivers some
valuable benefits, including the following:
 Regulates your schedule
 Connects you with others who can often lift your mood
 Widens your support network
 Provides a social context that enhances your perspective
208
Part IV: Helping Yourself 

Not everyone is a social butterfly, so don’t feel as though you need to pack
your schedule with social occasions. Some people value their time spent
alone much more than others. But do try to get out of the house, even if it
feels a little painful at first.
Leaving room for spontaneity
Some people think the perfect vacation is to ride around on a tour bus, visit-
ing main attractions. Others prefer to ramble about on their own, searching
for hidden gems. And some are content to sit in one place and watch the
world go by.
If you enjoy a more freewheeling lifestyle, a rigid routine may feel like too much
starch in the collar. To loosen up your lifestyle, program some unplanned
time into your schedule. Put regulations on your sleep, work, and meal times,
but leave the remainder of your schedule open.
To ensure successful long-term changes, consider making minor adjustments
over an extended period of time. You’re unlikely to follow through on dra-
matic changes that don’t align with your temperament.
Building Healthy Relationships
Relationships can contribute significantly to stabilizing moods. A friend
who’s more gregarious than you may encourage you to get out more and
become involved in activities that lift your moods. A companion who’s calm
and stable may act as a metronome, providing you with a steady rhythm and
pace that keep your mania in check.
Whether you want to work on improving a current relationship or building a
new one, remain aware of the following aspects of a relationship that can
affect mood stability:
 Healthy shared interests: If your shared interests consist of drinking,
smoking, or taking drugs, consider structuring your relationship around
healthier activities. Many people who suffer from substance-abuse prob-
lems face the difficult choice of having to dump some of their friends in
order to make healthier lifestyle adjustments.
 Acceptance and understanding: Accepting and understanding bipolar
disorder is difficult for you, but it can be even more difficult for friends
and relatives who don’t have first-hand experience with it. However, if
209
Chapter 13: Restructuring Your Life

they criticize you for it with words or through their body language and
behavior, the criticism only adds to your burden. By becoming more
informed about bipolar disorder, the people in your life can learn accep-
tance and understanding.
 Appreciation: The people who love you and find you attractive do so not
only despite your bipolar disorder, but also frequently because of it, or
at least partially because of it. When building new relationships, look for
people who appreciate your unique attributes and talents. Be careful of
people who appreciate your extreme highs and lows too much; they may
encourage unhealthy lifestyle choices for their own entertainment, even
though they may be completely oblivious to the effect of their actions.
 Support: Stabilizing your moods requires extra work on your part. You
need to manage your medications, make lifestyle adjustments, and pos-
sibly even face periods of unemployment and diminished cash flow.
During times of crisis, you need supportive people around you to meet
both your physical and emotional needs.
Every so often, evaluate your current relationships to determine if any of
them are undermining your mood stability. If you spot potentially harmful
relationships, decide whether they’re valuable enough to save or if you
would benefit from ending the relationships and investing your time and
energy in new, potentially productive connections.
Criticism, demands, judgment, and abuse (both physical and verbal) have no
place in a healthy relationship. Through therapy, you can often identify these
elements and root them out, assuming all parties involved are committed to
improving the relationship. If you’re in an unhealthy relationship, and the
other party refuses to negotiate, you face the difficult choice of remaining in
the relationship and risking your health or leaving the relationship.
Making Your Job Work for You
Sometimes, a job is just a job — something you do between the time you
wake up and the time you eat dinner. It puts some cash in your bank account.
But a job is usually much more than that. It can deliver bountiful benefits,
including the following:
 Security: Your employer may provide you with health and life insurance
and retirement benefits.
 Independence: Supporting yourself financially provides independence
and freedom. You don’t need to live according to the rules and regula-
tions imposed by people who support you.
210
Part IV: Helping Yourself 

 Identity: You’re not just you; you’re also a lawyer, a cook, a custodian, a
nurse, a singer, a butcher, a baker, or a candlestick maker. Losing a job
can make you wonder who you are, which isn’t always a good thing.
 Sense of accomplishment: Being a productive member of society can fill
you with a sense of accomplishment and pride.
 Community: Your colleagues and coworkers make up a community of
people with shared experiences. Even when you’re griping about low
pay or an overbearing boss, you’re bonding with others, which can help
stabilize your mood.
 Structure: Assuming you have fairly regular work hours, your work sched-
ule can help structure your life (see the first section of this chapter).
Bipolar disorder threatens to rob you of all these benefits by making tasks
more difficult to perform, complicating your life with medication and doctors’
appointments, and increasing your sensitivity to the pressures inherent in
your job. In some cases, bipolar disorder may convince you that you can no
longer function as a productive worker, which is usually bunk.
As a human being, you have the right to work and the right to reap the benefits
of a good job. The trick is to find an enjoyable and rewarding job that doesn’t
destabilize your moods. Finding such a job is no easy task, but this section
offers some suggestions, techniques, and tips that can help you succeed.
Hunting for a rewarding job
Some people change jobs as effortlessly as they change their socks. Others
are so entrenched in their career paths that any change seems insurmount-
able; they’ve been working as a teacher, investment broker, emergency nurse,
or whatever for 15 years and can’t imagine doing anything else. Or maybe
after 20 years on the job, they have too much to lose by packing up and
moving on. If your current job is contributing to mood instability, however,
you may need to make some adjustments; think of it as supplemental mental
health insurance.
The prospect of any major change in your life can leave you feeling over-
whelmed and curtail any attempts to generate a list of alternatives. Step
back, take a deep breath, and look at your situation one small step at a 
time — a strategy that reduces the massive anxiety associated with looking
at a big task all at once. You climb a mountain one step at a time by using
equipment to keep you from falling. A major life overhaul requires the same
systematic approach. And don’t be hesitant to get help and perspective from
a loved one or therapist.
211
Chapter 13: Restructuring Your Life

So, what are your options? They basically boil down to the following five:
 Improve your current job situation: Do you think you’d have the ideal
job if it just weren’t for this or that? Perhaps you can make a few adjust-
ments to find this and that. Refer to the following two sections for details.
 Change positions: Your employer is great, your supervisor is a doll, but
you just can’t imagine doing the same task you’ve been doing for the
past few years. One option is to seek out a different position in the same
company — maybe something that’s less stressful.
 Change employers: If you enjoy your work but find your work environ-
ment unbearable and unfixable, consider looking for another employer
in the same business.
 Change careers: Some careers are pressure cookers, destined to trigger
mood episodes. If you’re an emergency medical technician, air-traffic con-
troller, police officer, 911 dispatcher, grave-shift worker, or on another job
with irregular hours or a high level of stress, tabulate the toll that your
job takes on your mental health, and consider changing careers.
 File for disability: If you need to work with your healthcare providers
before you feel well enough to return to work, you can file for disability
benefits, which we explain at the end of this chapter.
Changing careers can be a monumental task, but it can also be fun to find out
what other people do to make money. If you’re considering a career change,
check out Cool Careers For Dummies, by Marty Nemko, Paul Edwards, and
Sarah Edwards, and Changing Careers For Dummies, by Carol L. McClelland,
PhD (both published by Wiley). These books list some of the more interesting
careers available and impart solid advice on how to execute a successful
career change.
Negotiating a healthy schedule
You probably devote about 40 hours of your 168-hour week to your employer,
and that total may not be negotiable. How you serve your 40 hours a week,
however, may be negotiable, and under the Americans with Disabilities Act,
your employer may be legally obligated to accommodate schedule adjust-
ments. What sort of adjustments can you request? The following list provides
some suggestions:
 Start and end time of your work day: Changing the time of day you
work may be necessary for establishing a healthy circadian rhythm and
for accommodating the side effects of your medications. Some employ-
ers offer flex time to all employees — for example, employees must work
eight hours a day sometime between the hours of 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.
 Break frequency and times: You may need more frequent breaks during
the day or breaks at specific times to take your medicine.
212
Part IV: Helping Yourself 

 Time off for doctor and therapy visits: Your doctor and therapist may
have office hours that conflict with your work schedule, in which case
you need additional time off during weekdays.
 Part-time employment: If you can’t work full time, request part-time
work, although this may affect your benefits.
 Telecommuting opportunities: Depending on the nature of your job and
the flexibility of your employer, you may be able to work all or part of
the week at home.
Work closely with your supervisor and your company’s human-resources
department to establish a schedule that’s healthy for you and productive for
your employer. If your employer refuses to make the necessary accommoda-
tions, submit your request in writing, accompanied by a note from your
doctor or therapist. The following sections provide additional information
about your rights as an employee.

A good job gone bad
At 30, Renee was on the fast track to a suc-
cessful career in nonprofit management — a
career that fed her passions and showcased
her talents. She loved the social activities — the
parties, the fund-raisers, the presentations —
and she would spend hours at home design-
ing and building presentations to wow her 
audiences.
That was before her full-blown manic attack. It
crept up on her gradually and unnoticed,
because she was always a high-energy person,
but when it hit, it hit hard. Her condition eventu-
ally sent her to the hospital. Over time, the
mania subsided, but it transitioned into a deep
depression that kept Renee from working for
several weeks.
With treatment, Renee was able to return to
work and pick up where she left off, but when
she returned, her focus and drive were dimin-
ished. Smiling to clients and pressing the flesh
with potential donors quickly sapped her
energy, and she no longer had the get-up-and-
go to work long hours on her slide-show pre-
sentations after work. Thinking that her
medications were diminishing her energy level,
she stopped taking them, only to experience 
an inevitable relapse and several more weeks
off work.
Renee discussed her situation and feelings with
her family, doctor, and therapist. She knew deep
down that the nature of her job was contributing
to her illness, but she felt that changing careers
at this point wasn’t an option. Finally, Renee hit
on a solution. She used her relationships at her
current job to connect to a smaller organization
where she could do more desk work and less
partying. Renee sometimes missed her old life,
and she still struggled with her moods and med-
icines, but with her new job, she had one less
enemy to battle.

Knowing your rights
Most people who suffer from bipolar disorder are dedicated employees. When
they miss work due to a mood episode, they’re not trying to stick it to their
employers. More often than not, they feel guilty for missing work and for any
inconvenience or disappointment they may have caused. They may even con-
sider themselves a burden and quit in order to relieve their employers of the
responsibility.
We can’t tell you whether you should stay in your current job or leave, but
we do encourage you to carefully consider your options before you make a
final decision. Keep in mind that when your employer hired you, the com-
pany made a commitment to you that it can’t break simply because you
happen to be ill. As an employee, you have certain rights that your employer
is legally obligated to honor. It’s your responsibility to know your rights and
to become aware of the potential risks and benefits of disclosing information
about your condition so you can negotiate from a position of power. The fol-
lowing question-and-answer session leads you through the basics:
Q: What information, if any, am I legally obligated to provide?
A: You may need to provide a letter or note from your doctor to excuse
an absence and make yourself eligible for sick pay. You’re not legally
obligated to disclose any information about your diagnosis or treatment.
People can ask for information, but only you decide whether or not to
provide details.
Q: Can my employer fire me for having bipolar disorder?
A: Legally, no. The Americans with Disabilities Act makes it illegal to fire
an employee due to a physical or mental disability. If you choose to
inform your supervisor, do it in writing, and keep a record of it. To find
out more about your rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act,
visit www.ada.gov or call 800-514-0301.
Q: What are the potential benefits of disclosing my condition?
A: Many employees with bipolar disorder find that disclosure relieves the
stress of trying to keep a secret. In addition, when your supervisor and
one or two coworkers know that you have bipolar disorder, they can help
you monitor your symptoms and provide appropriate assistance when
you need it most.
Q: What are the potential drawbacks of disclosing my condition?
A: Your supervisor may view you as a liability and overlook you for pro-
motions or even try to force you out without actually firing you. Ill-
informed, closed-minded colleagues may avoid you or mistreat you. You
214
Part IV: Helping Yourself 

can, however, choose to fight back by refusing exile and by carefully log-
ging incidents of unfair practices and treatment that follow the disclosure
of your diagnosis. However, keep your eye on the time and energy
required for this and how it affects your overall mental health.
Q: Can I request special accommodations?
A: Yes. Under the American with Disabilities Act, you have a right to rea-
sonable accommodations. Reasonable accommodations may include
extra training for specific tasks, the assistance of a mentor or job coach,
partitions or headphones to help minimize distractions, written as
opposed to verbal instructions, and the reassigning of minor job duties to
others so you can focus on your primary responsibilities.
Q: If I take time off, will my job be available when I return?
A: According to the Family and Medical Leave Act, you can take up to 12
weeks of unpaid leave with health coverage each year. If your employer
must hire someone to fill your position, your company must offer you a
comparable job when you return. You have to fill out and submit the
appropriate paperwork, and smaller companies may not be subject to
this law. For more information, visit the U.S. Department of Labor Web
site at www.dol.gov/esa/whd/fmla/ or call 866-487-9243.
Q: What should I do if I have a relapse?
A: If you feel overwhelmed after you return to work, resist any impulse to
quit, which can be very strong during an episode. Report your ill feelings
and go home for the day. If you think you need to see your doctor or ther-
apist, make an appointment. As long as you don’t quit, you’re still an
employee with certain rights. Don’t make any major life changes or deci-
sions during a major mood episode or even early in recovery. Maintain
the best mood you can with what you have, but don’t quit your job or
take a new one while you’re depressed or manic.
Q: Can I get my job back if I quit during a mood episode?
A: Maybe. You have a much better chance if you request your job back
within six months from the time you quit and if you can document that
you’ve been receiving treatment. Approach your employer first and then
contact ADA (visit www.ada.gov or call 800-514-0301) if your employer
needs additional prodding. If you can’t pursue this right now, ask one of
your support people to help you. Of course, your employer may decide
to hire you back, whether or not she’s legally obligated to do so.
When returning to work after an extended leave of absence, touch base with
your doctor and therapist at least once every two weeks until you adjust to
your work schedule. Having a doctor or therapist appointment set up at the
end of your first week back is always a good idea.

Chapter 13: Restructuring Your Life

Filing for disability benefits
The Social Security Administration (SSA) treats mental and physical disabili-
ties equally. That’s the official party line, anyway. In reality, mental disabili-
ties are more difficult to prove. If you can walk into a Social Security office,
talk to the receptionist, and fill out the paperwork, uninformed bureaucrats
usually conclude that you’re quite able to work. Here are the hoops you must
jump through to meet the guidelines and gain approval.
Meeting the guidelines
When you file for disability because of a mood disorder, the Social Security
workers evaluate whether or not you can still perform “work-related tasks.”
Using a set of guidelines referred to as the RFC (Residual Function Capacity)
evaluation, the SSA checks to make sure you meet the following conditions:
 You meet clinical criteria for bipolar disorder: Your doctor may be able
to provide the necessary information to enable the SSA to make this
determination. The SSA may also require that you see one of its recom-
mended doctors for a second opinion.
 Your disorder results in at least two of the following:
• Significant restriction of everyday activities
• Significant social difficulties
• Deficiencies in concentration that result in failure to complete
tasks on time
• Recurring episodes of deterioration at work that cause you to with-
draw from situations or that worsen your symptoms
Disability doesn’t have to be forever. Leaving your job and filing for disability
may be painful or make you feel like a failure, but remind yourself that you’re
doing what you must to regain your health and prepare yourself to be a
better employee in the future.
Improving your chances of approval
If bipolar disorder prevents you from holding down a job right now, consider
applying for disability immediately, no matter how unsure you are about your
chances of approval. Here are some suggestions that may improve your
chances of success:
 Consult your doctor and therapist: Their approval, support, and assis-
tance are critical to helping you establish the fact that bipolar disorder
prevents you from working and that any work during this stage of your
illness can worsen your symptoms. If you’re not currently seeing a
doctor for treatment, the SSA is very unlikely to approve your claim.
216
Part IV: Helping Yourself 

 File immediately: Disability claims can take several weeks to months to
process and often require that you file multiple appeals. In the mean-
time, you may go through your savings and face some real financial
hardship. The sooner you file, the better. Most disability lawyers won’t
even talk to you until you’ve filed a claim and been denied, so don’t
waste your time consulting a lawyer at this point.
 Appeal: If the SSA denies your initial claim, which it does 60 to 70 per-
cent of the time, consult a lawyer or other legal representative to file an
appeal. A judge can override the SSA’s original decision, but you may
need to appear at a hearing, in which case you should have a qualified
legal representative. You may need to appeal several times.
 Keep your doctor appointments and health records: Seeing your
doctor regularly provides you with documented proof of your bipolar
disorder and keeps your doctor in the loop, ensuring that she will sup-
port your appeal. You can’t expect your doctor to cooperate if she
hasn’t seen you in three months. Use the mood chart provided in
Chapter 12 or a journal or Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance per-
sonal calendar (www.dbsalliance.org) to keep track of the ways your
disorder affects your moods and life. Documented evidence can help
your case.
 Have your doctor complete an RFC form for you: Your doctor’s evalua-
tion of your ability to perform work-related tasks often carries more
weight than your personal opinion. Usually, the SSA has a form that it
sends to your doctor as part of the process of applying for disability, so
you may not have to request it from your doctor.
 Be nice: Whenever you want something done, you need to treat the
people involved with courtesy and respect. Most SSA employees are
inundated with paperwork and phone calls — giving them grief can only
hurt your case, not help it. Give yourself time to cool off before calling if
you’re angry or hurt about needing to appeal or not receiving a response
as quickly as you’d like.
 Keep copies: Copy everything before submitting it.
 Follow up: Wait a few days after you mail your claim and any pertinent
paperwork before you call to make sure that the SSA received the docu-
ments. If you can establish a good relationship with an individual at your
local SSA office, you have a better chance of keeping everything straight.
Don’t give up. The SSA may seem to be doing all that it can to discourage
people from filing for disability benefits, but persistence often pays off, and
the SSA is becoming more sensitive to the fact that bipolar disorder and
other mental illnesses can be as debilitating as physical disabilities. If you
can’t work for a while because of your disorder, you have every right to
receive benefits.

Working Out and Eating Right
In This Chapter
 Exercising your way to mood stability
 Moderating your moods through yoga, T’ai Chi, and meditation
 Feeding your moods a balanced diet
 Steering clear of easily accessible stimulants and depressants
You know that diet and exercise are important, because you can feel it.
When you eat a heavy meal and double-dip on dessert, you feel like a
beached blob of blubber. When you take a brisk walk or work out for an hour
at the local gym, you feel pumped up and energized. But in the process of jug-
gling your medications, doctor appointments, therapy, job, family, and every-
thing else in your life, you can easily overlook the most obvious and basic
components of your mental health: diet and exercise.
Can a healthy diet and exercise cure you? Not in and of themselves, but they
can act as low-cost, healthy complementary therapies, especially for bipolar
depression. A healthy diet combined with a sensible exercise program
increases the efficiency of your cardiovascular system, improves digestion,
and releases mood-enhancing endorphins. A healthy lifestyle can also help
you maintain steady energy levels and fend off the mind rot that commonly
accompanies a sedentary life.
In this chapter, we increase your awareness of how diet and exercise can affect
your moods and mood medications. We explore the benefits of cardiovascu-
lar exercises, such as walking and running, and reveal the mood-stabilizing
effects of centering exercises, including yoga and T’ai Chi. We introduce you
to foods that boost your moods and warn about those that sap your energy.
And we confront the evil consumables — caffeine, alcohol, and other stimu-
lants and depressants — that are well-known mood destabilizers.
As you read this chapter, keep in mind that your brain is part of your body,
and anything you can do to improve the condition of your body will likely
enhance your moods.

Sweating Out Your Bipolar Depression
You’re probably aware that aerobic exercise is good for both body and mind,
but you may not know about the unique benefits exercise offers people with
bipolar disorder:
 Exercise improves depression without inducing mania. Because most
antidepressants carry a risk of inducing mania, especially when taken
without a mood stabilizer, exercise provides an effective alternative. If
exercising late in the day keeps you from falling asleep, however, con-
sider moving your exercise routine to an earlier time slot.
 Exercise helps control weight gain, which commonly accompanies the
use of antipsychotic medications and mood stabilizers. Antipsychotic
medications and some mood stabilizers, including lithium and Depakote,
potentially have the negative side effect of causing weight gain. Exercise
can help minimize this effect.
You don’t need to down protein shakes and pump iron every day to get in
shape. If your primary goal is to regulate your moods, a 15- to 20-minute daily
walk is all you really need. Sure, you can do more, but if your current exercise
program consists of thinking about going running, you’re more likely to follow
through on a modest commitment, and you can immediately begin to reap
the mood-stabilizing benefits of aerobic exercise:
 Fresh air and sunshine
 Increased ability to sleep (in many cases)
 Improved digestion
 Increased energy levels
 Sense of accomplishment
 The feeling that you’re playing an active role in controlling your moods
Consult your doctor before you begin any strenuous exercise program, espe-
cially if you’re taking a mood stabilizer like lithium. When you perspire, you
lose fluids, which can increase the levels of these medications in your
system. In the case of lithium, increased levels can create a potentially fatal
condition. Your doctor can recommend ways to reduce the risks.
Centering Yourself through Yoga, 
T’ai Chi, and Meditation
Throughout the day, people tend to focus on external stimuli — the work 
that sits in front of you, the people who bump into you, car horns beeping,
220
Part IV: Helping Yourself 

telephones ringing, kids yelling, and so on. Your brain and body react to these
stimuli in subtle ways that you may not even notice. When you concentrate on
a project, your breathing becomes more shallow, your stomach tenses up, and
you squint. These reactions can affect your overall physiology and influence
your moods in negative ways. In some cases, the increased tension can ulti-
mately build up to levels that induce full-fledged depression or mania.
By increasing your mindfulness — your awareness of how you feel at this
moment — you can often counteract the negative effects of your body’s
unconscious reactions and learn to relax more completely. Several disciplines
can increase your mindfulness, including yoga, T’ai Chi, and meditation,
which we cover in the following sections.
Yoga
In addition to increasing your flexibility (so you can twist yourself into a pret-
zel), yoga’s primary goal is to increase your mindfulness. The distinctions
among mind, body, and soul melt away, opening you up to the moment and
enabling you to experience your connectedness to all being. And yoga feels
good, too.
You can probably sign up for Yoga 101 at your neighborhood YMCA or com-
munity center, but be aware that several types of yoga are available, includ-
ing Hatha, Karma, Kundalini, Raja, and Tantric. Different types of yoga appeal
to different people:
 Hatha yoga uses the body, through postures and breathing, to control
the mind and senses and to release psychic and physical energy. Hatha
is one of the most common beginning-level yoga disciplines. Teachers
generally encourage students to develop at their own pace.
 Kundalini yoga focuses on poses and intense breathing exercises
designed to awaken the six chakras, or main energy centers of the
human body. Breathing exercises are central to many therapies designed
to reduce anxiety, which is often associated with bipolar disorder.
For additional information about the various forms of yoga and specific
instructions, check out Yoga For Dummies, by Georg Feuerstein, PhD, and
Larry Payne, PhD (Wiley), or follow along with a videotape, such as Basic
Yoga Workout For Dummies with Sara Ivanhoe.
T’ai Chi
T’ai Chi is an ancient Chinese martial art that people are currently practicing
both as exercise and meditation. Many practitioners describe it as “moving
meditation.” Its slow, controlled movements and breathing can reduce stress,
221
Chapter 14: Working Out and Eating Right

tension, anxiety, anger, depression, and fatigue and sharpen mental acuity
and focus. Because T’ai Chi isn’t a strenuous exercise, you can perform it
during your lunch hour without getting all hot and sweaty.
T’ai Chi For Dummies, by Therese Iknoian (Wiley), is an excellent beginner’s
guide to the philosophy and practice of T’ai Chi.
Meditation
Although ancient Eastern practices have a certain romantic aura to them, you
don’t need to sign up for yoga or T’ai Chi classes in order to become more
mindful. You can increase your mindfulness simply by making a conscious
effort to be more aware of what you do every day. The following exercises
can help you practice mindfulness:
 When you’re stuck in traffic, focus on your breathing or on the music
that’s playing instead of thinking about where you want to go or what
you need to do later.
 When you lie down to go to sleep, focus on your breathing, the feel of
the pillow and sheets, and the darkness around you.
 Stop and note what you’re thinking and feeling several times during your
day at work. If you find yourself worrying about a deadline or a problem,
try to bring your thoughts and feelings into the moment, and focus on
the task at hand.
 Make a trivial task into a ceremony to become more mindful of it.
Whether you’re washing your hands, preparing a meal, brewing a pot of
coffee, or scrubbing dishes, focus on the moment, and become aware of
all the sensory stimulation around you.
The more you practice mindfulness and meditation, the easier they become.
By remaining committed to becoming more aware of the moment, you make
the process second nature. A bonus is that worries, time crunches, and finan-
cial problems may become less overwhelming, and you can start to tackle
them effectively.
Serving Up Healthy Foods 
in the Right Portions
You can’t pour soda into your car’s gas tank and expect it to purr; likewise, you
can’t pack your body with junk food and expect to feel energized and alert.
Your body requires the proper mix of nutrients for optimum performance. 
222
Part IV: Helping Yourself 

It needs carbohydrates for energy, proteins to form muscle and supply the
amino acids that your body requires to produce some neurotransmitters, and
a collection of vitamins and minerals to enable your body to carry out its
many physiological processes.
When you’re feeling depressed or manic, your diet is likely to suffer. You may
overeat to feed your mood, fast because food just doesn’t appeal to you, or
crave only foods that are high in sugar and starch. Following some basic
nutritional recommendations can improve your overall mood stability in the
long run:
 Eat regularly — three full meals a day or several small meals throughout
the course of a day.
 Don’t skip meals — especially breakfast.
 Eat a well-balanced diet.
 Consume coffee and alcohol in moderation, if at all.
The following sections provide specific recommendations to help you evalu-
ate and improve your diet.
How do you feel after you eat?
One of Mother Nature’s cruel jokes is that we often crave the foods and sub-
stances that can do our moods the most harm — caffeine, alcohol, sugars,
and starches — and avoid those that carry the greatest benefits — complex
carbohydrates and protein.
What effect do the foods you eat have on your moods? To find out, keep track
of what you eat and how you feel after eating certain foods. Here are some
simple steps:
1. Jot down how you feel just before eating.
Do you feel normal, tired, or full of energy?
2. Eat your meal or snack.
3. Jot down how you feel 30 minutes and then 60 minutes after eating.
Do you feel normal or tired? Is your heart beating significantly faster or
harder? Do you feel full of energy, light-headed, or wobbly?
If a certain food makes you feel terrible, you may have an intolerance for that
food. Symptoms of food intolerance can include stomach pain, nausea, diar-
rhea, gassiness, and headache. When your body isn’t feeling well, your mood
generally follows, so try to limit or avoid foods that cause discomfort.
223
Chapter 14: Working Out and Eating Right

Food allergies are a different story. A true food allergy can cause skin reac-
tions, shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, and jitteriness. More severe aller-
gic reactions include swelling of the mucous membranes and a potentially
life-threatening closure of the airways. These side effects are medical emer-
gencies. Only about 2 percent of the adult population has a true food allergy.
Alternative-medicine experts argue that many hidden food allergies con-
tribute to all kinds of negative symptoms, including emotional and behavioral
reactions, but well-designed research studies don’t support this idea. Most
medical experts agree that if certain foods bring discomfort, they can con-
tribute to a dip in mood, but so far food doesn’t appear to be a primary cause
of psychiatric symptoms. If you suspect that you may have a food allergy,
consult a specialist for a thorough evaluation, but question any claims that
you can fix your bipolar disorder solely through nutritional management.
The amount and type of food you consume can also influence how you feel
after a meal. If you get tired right after lunch, try eating more protein and veg-
etables and less sugar and other simple carbohydrates (see the following sec-
tion). Also, try eating smaller meals. Having the equivalent of a turkey dinner
for lunch can deplete your energy for the rest of the afternoon.
Sugar and other simple carbohydrates
Need an energy boost? For a quick fix, sugar and starch usually do the trick.
A soft drink, a doughnut, a snack cake . . . pick your poison. Do they work?
You bet. Not only do they inject you with a quick boost of energy, but they
also elevate your serotonin levels. But sugar and simple carbohydrates have
a dark side. Foods such as white rice, potato chips, cookies, crackers, and
pasta often take your body on a roller-coaster ride of sugar highs and lows.
You may feel an initial energy surge, but watch out later. In about 30 to 60
minutes, you crash as your blood-sugar drops, leaving you drained and crav-
ing your next sugar fix.
The reason that a sugar buzz doesn’t last is that it triggers a dramatic boost in
blood-sugar levels that your body must respond to in order to survive. As your
blood-sugar rises, your pancreas dumps insulin into your system to convert
excess sugar to fat for storage. With a large rush of insulin, your blood-sugar
drops, making you feel sleepy or cranky and often hungry for more sweets.
To steady your moods, cut down on junk foods, including soda, cookies, candy,
and cake, and avoid simple carbohydrates, including most breads and pastas,
potatoes, and highly processed foods. Whole-grain products, vegetables, and
fresh fruits contain complex carbohydrates that enter your system gradually,
preventing extreme fluctuations in your blood-sugar levels.
224
Part IV: Helping Yourself 

Protein
When you hear the word “protein,” you probably think “muscle.” But protein
contributes to many other areas of the body as well. The basic building
blocks of proteins are amino acids, several of which act as neurological regu-
lators. When you consume protein, your body immediately breaks it down
into amino acids so it can transport them to where your body needs them.
One of these amino acids, tyrosine, is a building block of excitatory neuro-
transmitters — dopamine and norepinephrine — that can increase energy,
make you feel more alert, and improve performance.
We don’t recommend that you follow the Atkins diet and eat only protein and
vegetables, but obtaining sufficient protein can help stabilize your moods.
Meat provides the easiest way to obtain the nine essential amino acids that
comprise complete proteins, but vegetarians can get their protein by combin-
ing complementary food items, such as beans and rice, beans and corn, and
whole wheat and peanuts. Vegetarians should also monitor their intake of
essential vitamins and minerals (especially B-complex vitamins and selenium);
refer to Chapter 9 for information about supplements.
Fruits and vegetables
Open your fridge and take a quick inventory of the fresh fruits and vegetables
you have on hand. Chances are that your stock is woefully inadequate. Most
people in the United States subsist on a steady diet of sugar, fat, and protein.
Fruits and vegetables serve as garnishes to make the meat and potatoes look
better.
225
Chapter 14: Working Out and Eating Right
Chocolate, glorious chocolate
Considered by some to be the perfect mood
food, chocolate has several ingredients that
contribute to mood alteration: a dash of sugar
to increase energy and serotonin levels, a pinch
of phenylethylamine (a brain chemical that your
body releases when you fall in love), smidgens
of theobromine and magnesium to enhance
brain function, a touch of caffeine to make you
more alert, and a few grams of protein to boost
the excitatory neurotransmitters.
Of course, too much chocolate can give you a
bellyache, which is a definite downer. Hershey
Kisses or a handful of M&Ms in moderation,
however, may be just the morsels you need to
get over that midafternoon speed bump.

To improve your moods, at least indirectly, increase your daily consumption
of fresh fruit and fresh or frozen vegetables. These food items offer some
unique benefits you can’t find in most processed foods:
 Fiber, which improves digestion
 Vitamins and minerals commonly lacking in meat, pasta, and breads
 Complex carbohydrates that provide a steady flow of sustenance and
energy throughout the day (rather than the highs and lows associated
with sugary and starchy foods)
Avoiding the Not-So-Good, 
the Bad, and the Ugly
Caffeine, nicotine, diet pills, alcohol, marijuana, and other uppers and down-
ers form a veritable cornucopia of legal and illegal mood manipulators. If you
wash down your antianxiety medication with an energy drink and head out
for a night of bar-hopping with your buddies, you may be doing more harm
than you can possibly imagine. Although these substances may seem inno-
cent enough, they can wreak havoc on your carefully crafted medication com-
bination and attempts at improving your diet and exercise.
The following sections introduce a few of the most common and available
drugs and substances that can cause problems. The list isn’t exhaustive; we
don’t include plenty of dangerous street drugs, including methamphetamine
and cocaine. Such illicit drugs are so wrong in so many ways, we’ve deemed
them too obvious to mention.
Caffeine, nicotine, and other uppers
Getting jacked up on coffee, tea, or soda can be a thrill. The chemical reac-
tions pump you up and make you feel a little less groggy in the morning and
after lunch, and the drinks taste yummy, too. For an added boost, you can
light up a cigarette. Unfortunately, these stimulants can bump up your heart
rate and blood pressure and accelerate both your brain and body. They can
magnify mania, irritate a depressed brain, and join forces to undermine the
efforts of your mood stabilizers.
To minimize the negative effects of these socially acceptable mood boosters,
consider taking the following actions:
226
Part IV: Helping Yourself 

 Eliminate caffeine, or monitor your intake and reduce consumption.
Some studies show that ingesting small amounts of caffeine throughout
the morning and afternoon may be more beneficial and less harmful
than consuming large quantities at a single sitting.
 Stop smoking, or cut back on the number of cigarettes you smoke.
This applies to tobacco chewers and cigar aficionados, too.
 Avoid any other stimulants — especially amphetamines.
Amphetamines are intensified versions of caffeine and nicotine and can
easily trigger full-blown manic episodes or psychosis. If you have a prob-
lem with amphetamine use, speak to your doctor or seek out community
resources, such as Narcotics Anonymous (www.na.org), to get help
right away.
Quitting caffeine or nicotine use cold turkey can be extremely difficult.
Withdrawal symptoms include headache, fatigue, and irritability. Taper off
your use gradually, or remain vigilant of any significant mood shifts if you
decide to quit cold turkey. Your doctor should be more than happy to help
you develop a cessation program to alleviate withdrawal symptoms.
Alcohol, marijuana, and other downers
When you’re under emotional and psychological duress, a bottle of booze, a
bag of weed, or a couple of downers may seem like welcome relief. That’s one
of the reasons why so many people with bipolar disorder self-medicate with
these substances. Although drugs do provide temporary relief, the negative
long-term effects and the potentially dangerous interactions they can have
with prescription medications far outweigh the benefits.
In and of itself, alcoholism is destructive; it’s a potentially deadly illness that
tears apart families and shatters lives. In combination with bipolar disorder,
alcohol can be a life-stopper, causing the following problems:
 As a depressant, alcohol cranks down your brain energy. In high con-
centrations, it poisons the brain and can cause death. It can actually
make you feel more depressed over time.
 Alcohol reduces impulse control. In people with mania, it can enhance
dangerous behavioral patterns. In a depressed person, alcohol can take
away the hesitation to commit suicide. Completed suicides are very
often related to alcohol intoxication in a depressed person.
 Alcohol can interact in dangerous ways with some of the medications
used to combat bipolar disorder — particularly lithium. It can change
blood levels of medication, and it can cause increased sedation and
slowed thinking — more so than alcohol or medicine alone. In some
combinations, such as with tranquilizers like Valium, alcohol can cause
you to stop breathing.
227
Chapter 14: Working Out and Eating Right

The after-school message here is that alcohol and bipolar disorder don’t mix.
If you don’t have an alcohol dependence, stop using it. If you have an alcohol
problem, get help right away. Talk to your doctor or contact Alcoholics Anony-
mous (www.alcoholics-anonymous.org). Talk to your family. Alcohol
abuse presents a life-threatening problem. Don’t wait.
Toking a joint or gobbling up a batch of marijuana brownies can also calm
your nerves — at least temporarily — but marijuana is another potentially
dangerous agent, especially when you’re working hard to maintain mood sta-
bility. If you self-medicate with marijuana, strongly consider the following rea-
sons to stop:
 Although marijuana can generate feelings of euphoria, it can also trigger
paranoia and anxiety.
 Because marijuana is unregulated, its active ingredient, THC, varies in
concentration with each batch. You never know what you’re really getting.
 Like alcohol, marijuana can decrease inhibitions and increase your
chances of getting in trouble.
Smoking marijuana when you have bipolar disorder is like injecting an
unknown fuel into a high-performance engine. You’ve spent time, money, and
energy tuning up your mental performance with medications, therapy, and
lifestyle changes. Don’t fry your engine on a fleeting joyride.
Weight-loss and energy supplements
Popping a diet pill or gulping an energy drink may seem innocent enough
when you’re in good health, but many diet pills and energy tonics are laced
with potentially dangerous stimulants — some that are just as dangerous as
nicotine or caffeine. Some diet “doctors” even hand out bona-fide ampheta-
mines and amphetamine-like substances to help their patients shed a few
pounds. Taking pills to keep your weight down is particularly tempting if 
your doctor just put you on a medication that causes you to gain weight 
(like lithium).
We’re not telling you that you have to live with weight gain, but you can take
safer steps to keep your weight in check:
 Consult your psychiatrist. He or she may be able to suggest an alterna-
tive medication that doesn’t cause weight gain or add a medication to
safely counteract that side effect. Your psychiatrist can monitor your
glucose and cholesterol levels for some medications. Use this informa-
tion to help plan your dietary strategies.
228
Part IV: Helping Yourself 

 Consult your family physician or a qualified nutritionist to develop a
sound weight-loss program. Messing with your appetite and weight
without help isn’t advisable when you’re working hard to keep your
body and brain comfortable and in balance.
Drastic dieting — fasting or following extreme low-calorie regimens — can be
as dangerous as diet medicines when it comes to your bipolar treatment.
Medication levels and effects change with body weight and metabolism, so
dramatic or rapid body changes can do damage when you’re trying to stabi-
lize your moods and medications.
Over-the-counter medications
How do you find out which everyday medications are safe with your bipolar
meds? Check with your doctor, of course. In the meantime, consult the fol-
lowing list of common medications that are high up on the no-no list:
 Avoid pain relievers such as ibuprofen and Naprosyn when you’re on
lithium. Your kidneys clear these meds, and they can potentially cause
kidney damage.
 Decongestants such as Sudafed (and any others that contain pseudo-
ephedrine) are stimulants and can exacerbate mania or depression or
worsen symptoms, even when calming agents are on board.
229
Chapter 14: Working Out and Eating Right
Janice’s diet compromise
Janice was a young woman who had struggled
with a major weight problem throughout her life.
As a teenager, she lost over 100 pounds and had
maintained her lighter weight during her first
few years of college. The summer before her
senior year, however, she developed an agi-
tated depression that evolved into a manic
episode. Her medication trials were difficult, but
a combination of an SSRI (Selective Serotonin
Reuptake Inhibitor) and lithium proved effective.
The only problem was that she regained almost
all the weight she had lost. She started eating
more when she first became depressed, and
the lithium seemed to pile on more pounds daily.
After a few months of stability, Janice became
so frustrated with her weight gain that she
stopped all her medications abruptly. She imme-
diately crashed into a profound depression and
was hospitalized. Eventually, she returned to
lithium — at the lowest possible dose — with a
commitment to exercise more and consume less
junk food. Although she didn’t return to her ideal
weight, Janice did manage to shed most of her
extra pounds and accepted the fact that a stable
mood is more important than 30 extra pounds.

 Avoid Dextromethorphan, a cough suppressant, when you’re taking
SSRIs. This drug is abused in some cases; people take very high doses of
the cough suppressant to induce euphoria. Read the labels and choose a
cough suppressant that doesn’t use Dextromethorphan.
 Avoid over-the-counter sleep aids unless your doctor gives you the
thumbs-up.
Herbal and so-called “natural” products can also botch your bipolar treat-
ments. Many herbal medications, although they may sound no more harmful
than salt and pepper, can be quite powerful. Here are a handful you should
watch out for:
 Ephedra and its more recent substitutes are stimulants to be avoided.
 Valerian is a powerful sedative, but it can have numerous interactions
with psychiatric medications and symptoms.
 Melatonin can be a useful sleep aid, but it may be harmful in combina-
tion with some antidepressants.
 Kava, marketed as a calming agent, can cause severe liver damage.
 St. John’s wort can make birth-control pills ineffective.
Chapter 9 covers herbal and natural products in greater depth to help you
weigh the potential benefits and risks, but you should always consult your
doctor before adding another substance to your brew. By keeping your doctor
informed, you facilitate the process of arriving at a medical treatment that’s
safe and effective for you. Most psychiatrists are comfortable talking about
these compounds with patients and will look into possible interactions.

ndependence is what people generally value most. It’s one of the few
rights in life that people are willing to risk their lives to attain. When you
receive your bipolar diagnosis, it can make you feel completely dependent at
first — on your healthcare providers, family, friends, and other concerned
individuals. In the midst of a mood episode, you may not even be able to
trust your own perceptions and judgment.
Although a loss of freedom may not seem like it’s worth it, what are your
options? You basically have two choices:
 Get professional treatment and, with the help of others and the right
medications and therapy, regain control over your life.
 Relinquish your fate to bipolar disorder, in which case you risk ruining
your relationships, career, finances, and other aspects of your life that
create your identity.
When faced with these two choices, a surprising percentage of people with
bipolar disorder choose the second option when first diagnosed. Why? Well,
that’s the subject of this chapter. Here, we reveal several reasons why you may
want to resist medical treatment. We do this to validate any apprehensions you
have and to help you overcome any natural resistance you may want to put up.
We explain the risks of not adhering to your treatment plan, provide tips to
help you manage your medications, and offer advice on how to team up with
your doctor and support network. Throughout this chapter, you discover how
to take the necessary steps to regain your sense of independence by accepting
and mastering the mood-management tools at your disposal.

“Why I Don’t Take My Meds”
Head over to the nearest all-you-can-eat buffet, and ask the diners waddling
back to their tables with heaping portions if they’re following their doctors’
orders and acting in the best interest of their overall health. Dig through any
medicine cabinet (just don’t get caught!), and count the unused portions of
medications that have specific instructions to take the medicines until
they’re used up. The tendency to ignore doctors’ orders and avoid taking
medication doesn’t apply only to people with bipolar disorder; the rebellion
is universal. People just want to enjoy their lives, unfettered by diet restric-
tions, medications, and “helpful” advice.
The resistance to medical intervention is even more prevalent in people with
bipolar disorder, and for good reason — actually, for several good reasons. In
this section, we explore some of the most common reasons that people with
bipolar disorder stop taking their medications, and we provide rebuttals to
convince you to continue taking your medications, as prescribed, even when
you prefer not to.
They don’t work
Aspirin and Tylenol can alleviate pain in a matter of minutes. Decongestants
typically start to work in less than an hour. Depakote, a very effective mood
stabilizer, takes about 10 days. Prozac and other SSRI (Selective Serotonin
Reuptake Inhibitor) antidepressants commonly require three to six weeks to
achieve their full therapeutic effects. No wonder why someone suffering from
depression or mania stops taking the medications; having to wait over a week
for relief is torture, not treatment.
The following suggestions may help you endure the delay and possibly
shorten it:
 Ask your doctor up front how long each medication should take
before it begins to work. Sometimes, knowing that a medication may
take a week or three weeks to start working, rather than 15 minutes to
an hour, can reduce your anxiety. Mark the days on your calendar.
 Ask your doctor what to expect when the medication starts working.
Sometimes, doctors prescribe medications without offering a thorough
explanation of how they’re supposed to help. Knowing the potential
long-term benefits of medications can often encourage you to keep
taking them, even when you don’t see immediate benefits.
232
Part IV: Helping Yourself 

 Expect some ups and downs during the initial recovery. You probably
won’t wake up one day feeling cured. You can expect good days, not-so-
good days, and bad days. The goal is to string together more good days
than bad.
 Contact your doctor and ask if you can do anything to feel better
faster. Your doctor may be able to add a medication to the mix on a tem-
porary basis and then pull it back when you begin to feel better.
 If you don’t feel better in the time period that your doctor specifies,
contact her immediately. You may need a medication change, extra
time, or a higher dose.
They work great — I’m fine now
Taking medication when you feel fine may seem about as rational as putting 
a bandage on unharmed skin — what’s the point? The point — actually, two
points — is maintenance and prevention. Maintenance means that the medi-
cine has to stay on board for you to continue feeling better. When you treat a
mood episode, the episode doesn’t melt away — the medicine suppresses it.
The episode has its own lifespan, and if you stop the medication too soon,
the symptoms will bubble back up to the surface. Basically, you feel better
because of the medicine; stop the medicine, and you stop feeling better.
The other primary goal of medication is prevention. Doctors often prescribe
mood stabilizers as prophylactics. As such, the medicine doesn’t just make
you feel better when you become ill; it reduces the likelihood of a recurrence
of symptoms. By preventing symptoms, you reap the following benefits:
 Avoid potential fallout from mood episodes, such as broken relation-
ships or loss of employment
 Reduce the frequency and intensity of mood episodes
 Improve the course of the illness
 Avoid a stay in the hospital
The side effects are scary
Because so many antipsychotics and mood stabilizers cause weight gain,
doctors may prescribe yet another medication to reduce weight or appetite.
One such medication is topiramate (Topamax), which sometimes causes
233
Chapter 15: Battling the Urge to Fly Solo

fuzzy thinking. In other words, you get a choice: You can be fat or stupid.
Many of the medications for treating mood disorders offer similar choices:
 Depakote controls mania but can result in weight gain.
 Lithium stabilizes moods with the potential risk of causing weight gain,
kidney damage, or thyroid dysfunction.
 Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft, and other SSRI antidepressants alleviate depression
at the risk of inducing mania and causing negative sexual side effects.
 Lamictal helps control depression without inducing mania but may
cause a potentially lethal rash, although the risk can be reduced signifi-
cantly by gradually ramping up the dose at the beginning of treatment.
 Antipsychotics can cause weight gain, sedation, changes in sugar or fat
metabolism, and other side effects.
Potentially negative side effects accompany all medications, even aspirin. If
the medications are powerful enough to work, they’re powerful enough to
have side effects. Always discuss potential side effects with your doctor so
you know what to look for and what to do if you experience one or more neg-
ative side effects.
Your doctor may offer suggestions, such as the following, on how to alleviate
the most bothersome side effects:
 Ramp up dosages gradually. Many negative side effects occur when you
start taking a medication. Your doctor may be able to increase the
dosage gradually to avoid or diminish the intensity of the side effects.
 Change medication times. If you typically take a medication in the
morning, for example, and it makes you too drowsy for work, your
doctor may recommend that you take it in the afternoon or evening.
 Switch to an extended-release version of a medication. Many medica-
tions come in extended-release tablets that release the medication to
your bloodstream in a gradual manner. Consult your doctor concerning
your options.
 Add another medication to counteract the negative side effect. For
example, if you experience weight gain on Depakote, your doctor may
prescribe Topamax to reduce weight gain.
 Change your medication. If a medication causes intolerable side 
effects, your doctor may wean you off your current medication and 
prescribe a new medication that’s less likely to produce the side 
effect you experienced.
Some side effects, such as drowsiness or digestive problems, go away after
you take the medication for several weeks and your body adjusts to it. If you
don’t want to wait, or if the side effect interferes with your life, insist on
receiving help.
234
Part IV: Helping Yourself 

I forget to take them
When you feel well, you have better, more important things to attend to than
your medications — work, relationships, kids, golf. But when you have bipo-
lar disorder, managing your medications should become a priority, or at least
a well-ingrained habit.
To stay on top of your daily medications, try the following techniques:
 Record your medications on an index card. Keep the index card in your
wallet or purse, or stick it to the side of your refrigerator for quick refer-
ence. Update the record whenever your doctor adjusts your medications.
 Use a seven-day pillbox. A seven-day pillbox has a compartment for
each day of the week so you know exactly what you need to take each
day. You can even affix a sticker to the box that lists the times of day for
taking each medication.
 Store your medications where you can see them. This provides you
with a visual reminder to take your medication.
 Link your medication to daily meals or events. Remembering to take
your medications when you wake up, before you go to bed, or at meal-
time may be easier than setting a specific time, such as 10 a.m.
 Assign the task to a responsible family member. If you simply can’t
remember to take your medication on time, ask a family member to
remind you.
Having a family member or friend remind you to take your medication isn’t
always the best idea. The person you choose may be worse than you at
remembering. In addition, if you’re the type of person who doesn’t like
reminders from others, you may begin to perceive gentle reminders as nag-
ging, which can be reason enough to resist.
Normal is boring
The alternative to the extreme highs and lows of bipolar disorder is normalcy.
How dull is that? You get to be like everyone else — the people who find small
talk intriguing, who’ve never experienced the utter loneliness of depression,
and who remain unfazed by a world gone mad.
Your mania may have given you new insights and ideas, a vivacious personal-
ity, and a high energy level. With medication, you may feel like the color has
gone out of your life and that your mind is dull and gray; you may be bored
and feel like time has slowed down; and you may wonder how you’ll be able
to enjoy life without mood-induced drama and excitement.
235
Chapter 15: Battling the Urge to Fly Solo

If your medications have flat-lined your moods, try the following:
 Realize that your muted mood probably is a temporary condition. You
may need several weeks to recover from a full-blown mood episode; the
medications may take several days or weeks to begin working; and the
negative side effects usually wear off as your moods begin to stabilize.
 Consult your doctor. As your depression or mania settles down, your
doctor may be able to tweak your medications so you can experience
more acceptable mood fluctuations.
 Accept that your recovery is a process. Side effects and medication
trials can cause some people to get worse before they get better. Your
healthcare providers will do everything in their power to prevent this,
but it does happen. Don’t assume that you’ll never get better, even if
your first few treatments make you feel dull, slow, or sluggish or worsen
your mood symptoms. Stay in close contact with your doctors, and keep
them informed about all your symptoms. Continue asking for more treat-
ment options until you find an option that works.
I just want to be me
When you’ve lived with bipolar disorder for most of your life, separating it
from your personality can be difficult. Some people are fine with it. They knew
all along that something wasn’t right, and when the wild mood swings are
gone, they finally feel some balance. Other people miss themselves. They feel
like some very essential qualities of their personalities have been extracted.
They’ve lost their mojo, and they want it back . . . without the sleepless nights,
ruined relationships, unpaid bills, and other inconveniences, of course.
Give yourself time to mourn your losses — the life you used to have — adjust
to your current condition, and embrace your future prospects — a life with-
out debilitating mood episodes. You’re still you. Medication doesn’t take
away your creativity, energy, and zest for life. With a stable mood, you have
the power to discover things you really enjoy and go after them. Therapy can
help you through the transition (see Chapter 8 for info on therapy options).
I can control my moods 
without medication
Some people claim that they can successfully control their bipolar symptoms
through diet, exercise, therapy, and the cooperation of family and friends,
just as some people can control some types of diabetes by making dramatic
lifestyle changes. Is this possible? Think of it this way: You can survive a free
236
Part IV: Helping Yourself 

fall from 100 feet, but you’d have a much better chance strapped to a well-
anchored, 50-foot bungee cord. Controlling bipolar symptoms without med-
ication is extremely risky; the medical community advises against it, and we
certainly don’t recommend that you actually try it.
Bipolar disorder does, however, have several degrees of severity. Some
milder forms can be amenable to less medical intervention, just as you can
manage some types of diabetes with lifestyle changes (whereas some require
insulin treatment). You should never attempt to reduce or eliminate your
medications without discussing the situation with your doctor. You need to
know how severe your bipolar disorder is and your chances of recovering
and/or maintaining stability with less medicine. The following conditions also
need to be in place:
 Your moods are currently stable.
 Your doctor approves and agrees to supervise your attempt — slowly
decreasing doses of your current medications.
 You and your family have received some solid therapy, especially cogni-
tive behavioral therapy and family therapy, which we explain in Chapter 8.
 Your support network is cooperative and well informed.
 You and your support network have a system in place to carefully moni-
tor your moods.
 You have a solid backup plan in case something goes wrong.
Even under these conditions, withdrawing your mood medications entirely is
extremely risky. Consider working out compromises with your doctor and
therapist. With additional therapy, you have a chance to manage your moods
with less medication rather than no medication. Think in terms of making
minor changes over several months or years rather than major changes in a
short period of time.
Other people need them more than I do
Are you a human dreaming you’re a butterfly or a butterfly dreaming that it’s
human? Are you a sane person in a mad world or a mad person in a sane
world? For centuries, thinkers have wondered what’s real and what’s surreal,
who’s sane and who’s not, who’s paranoid and who’s just a little more per-
ceptive than the average Joe.
People with bipolar disorder live with similar questions and doubts. “Am I
depressed or just more perceptive and sensitive than those around me? Am I
irritable because of my mania or because the world is too slow and stupid?
Can it be possible that I really am psychic?”
237
Chapter 15: Battling the Urge to Fly Solo

We can’t answer those questions, but even if we could, we’re not sure the
answers would do you any good, because the reality of your situation is
what’s important:
 Your mood swings exceed safe limits.
 Your depression and mania are negatively affecting your life.
 Any attempts at controlling your moods without medicine 
haven’t worked.
Perhaps the world is a mess. Maybe others around you need to deal with
their own issues. You may be smarter and more perceptive than others. You
may even have a genius IQ. But right now, you’re the one with the diagnosed
illness, and you’re the only person you have control over. A combination of
medication, therapy, and support currently offers the greatest hope for relief.
Even if the people around you need medication more than you do, getting
your own treatment can help you deal with them.
Bottom line: It’s a control thing
Not adhering to your treatment plan by not taking your prescribed medica-
tions is basically a control issue. People like to feel as though they can control
their destinies without the assistance of foreign substances. Almost every
reason you can give for not taking your medication boils down to control:
Reason: The meds don’t work.
Translation: My meds can’t control me.
Reason: The meds work great — I’m fine now.
Translation: I can control myself from this point on.
Reason: The side effects are scary.
Translation: I have no control over what the medications do to me.
Reason: I forget to take them.
Translation: I control when I take them and when I don’t.
Reason: Normal is boring.
Translation: When I was in control, life was more interesting.
Reason: I just want to be me.
Translation: The medications control my personality.
238
Part IV: Helping Yourself 

Reason: I can control my moods without medication.
Translation: I can control my moods.
Reason: Other people need them more than I do.
Translation: Don’t try to control me.
Not adhering to your treatment plan provides a false sense of control. 
By relinquishing some control to medications and to your doctor, thera-
pist, family, and friends, you gain much more control over your life and 
your destiny.
Weighing the Risks of Nonadherence
Every “either/or” choice has potential benefits and drawbacks. To weigh the
benefits against the drawbacks, you stack the benefits on one side and the
drawbacks on the other and then decide if the potential benefits are worth
the risk. Making a decision can be as simple as that.
Listing the benefits of stopping your meds
On one side of the scale, you stack the potential benefits of not taking your
medications:
 $avings from prescriptions
 Freedom from popping pills
 No nasty side effects
 Creative, energetic highs of hypomania
Listing the drawbacks
On the other side of the scale, you stack the potential drawbacks of not
taking your medications:
 Strained or ruined relationships
 Lost employment
 Debilitating depression
239
Chapter 15: Battling the Urge to Fly Solo

 Risky behavior that leads to illness, injury, and possibly death
 Legal problems
 Financial problems
 Masochistic and suicidal behaviors that potentially lead to death or per-
manent disability
Making your choice
After stacking the pros on one side of the scale and the cons on the other, see
which side carries more weight. Most people with bipolar disorder eventually
decide that not taking medication is far too risky, but only you can weigh the
factors and decide what’s best for you.
You should also keep in mind that stopping one or more medications often
carries more risks than if you never took the medication in the first place:
 Withdrawal symptoms can make you feel temporarily better, causing
you to believe that the medication caused problems that it didn’t 
actually cause.
 Withdrawal can induce mania or depression.
 If you decide to go back on the medication later, it may no longer work
for you.
People who choose to ditch their medications tend to focus on one factor,
such as a particularly nasty side effect. When faced with the decision of
whether or not to take your medications, carefully evaluate all the potential
benefits and risks and discuss them with your doctor and therapist. An
honest, open discussion may be just what you need to stay on course.
Avoiding Self-Medication 
and Self-Regulation
Every home is equipped with a thermostat that regulates its temperature.
You set the thermostat to the desired temperature, and it maintains that tem-
perature throughout the day. People who don’t quite grasp this concept like
to fiddle with the dials. When they feel a chill, they crank their thermostats
up to 80°F. An hour later, they feel hot and sweaty, so they crank them down
to 60°F. If they feel cold again, they crank the dials back up to 75°F. This hap-
pens throughout the day, to the consternation of other family members who
actually understand the concept of temperature regulation.
240
Part IV: Helping Yourself 

People with bipolar disorder who self-medicate and self-regulate to feel
immediate comfort essentially play with their mood thermostats. The temp-
tation is understandable. When you feel ready to work, you want to feel alert
and creative. When you want to party, you try to feel sociable and engaging.
When you’re ready to sleep, you want to feel tired. But most mood medica-
tions don’t work that way. They’re designed to reach a therapeutic level in
your brain, establish a comfortable baseline, and prevent wild mood swings,
not to boost you when you want to be up and calm you when you need some
downtime.
Self-medicating and self-regulating often result in overcorrections that
increase mood cycling. To maintain a more stable mood, work with your
doctor to adjust your medications gradually. Avoid the temptation to self-
medicate with feel-good drugs and other nonprescription substances and to
self-regulate by adjusting doses on your own.
Teaming Up with Your Caregivers
At most bipolar support-group meetings, you’re likely to hear at least one
person griping about a psychiatrist. Most complaints center on availability;
241
Chapter 15: Battling the Urge to Fly Solo
Janette’s jam
Janette was a beautiful and talented musician,
described by family and friends as tempera-
mental with a flair for the dramatic. She and 
her husband, also a musician, lived the artist’s
life — late-night jams, unwinding into the early
morning, sleeping late each day, dabbling in
substance abuse, and spending plenty of time
on the road. Such was their life before Janette’s
first major depressive episode slammed it into
reverse. She could barely drag herself out of
bed in the morning, let alone rehearse or even
consider performing. She became agitated,
anxious, and suspicious of everyone.
Her doctor started her on a combination of anti-
depressants and antipsychotics, and within
days she felt better — so much better that she
began flying into mania. Her husband immedi-
ately called the doctor, and she bumped down
the antidepressant and upped the antipsychotic
a bit. Two days later, Janette experienced
episodes of despair that alternated with her
improved mood. She and her husband wanted
to add more medications right away to balance
out her moods. Instead, their doctor suggested
a low-dose tranquilizer to ease the acute dis-
comfort while Janette waited for the “big-gun”
medications to settle in and do their thing. The
doctor also encouraged Janette to take a break
from work (especially the late nights) to give her
brain and body a genuine chance at recovery
and repair. Within a couple of weeks, Janette’s
moods began to settle down, and she was
sleeping through the night, although it took a full
six weeks before she felt consistently like her
old self.

the psychiatrist is unavailable during a time of crisis, doesn’t return a phone
call or e-mail message, or is out of the office for an extended period of time.
Other complaints focus on communication issues; the psychiatrist doesn’t
listen, refuses to make the requested medication adjustments, or fails to fully
explain the diagnosis and treatment plan. In most cases, the people feel like
they must make a medical decision alone. Whether this feeling is justified or
not doesn’t really matter. What matters is that the situation is unacceptable
and needs to be resolved.
The relationships you establish with your psychiatrist and therapist con-
tribute significantly to your treatment outcome. If you feel that your care-
givers are unreceptive to your concerns and unavailable when you need them
most, your relationships may become adversarial, creating a situation in
which you and your caregivers work against one another. On the other hand,
if you establish relationships built on trust, you’re much more likely to
adhere to your treatment plan and communicate your concerns and feelings
honestly and openly.
The following suggestions can help you establish a more productive, collabo-
rative relationship with your healthcare providers:
 Commit to full disclosure. Let your caregivers know when you haven’t
taken your medication and when you’ve attempted to self-medicate.
What they don’t know can hurt you.
 Follow their expert advice. You wouldn’t take your sputtering car into
the shop and then refuse to have it tuned up, so don’t seek psychiatric
care and then refuse treatment.
 Ask questions. If you have a question about your diagnosis or treat-
ment, ask. Your insurance company may allocate only 15 minutes for
your psychiatrist to evaluate your medications and make adjustments,
so have your questions written down and ready.
 Voice your concerns. When you experience a negative side effect, let
your doctor know about it. If you’re upset that your doctor didn’t return
a phone call or that you couldn’t get an appointment when you needed
to, mention these concerns as well. Ask for what you need.
 Offer suggestions. If you hear or read about a treatment option or new
medication that you want to try, bring it up to your doctor and ask for
advice. Your doctor may know more about the medication and how
effective or ineffective it is.
Finding the perfect doctor is like finding the perfect spouse: impossible,
because the perfect doctor doesn’t exist. You need to find a doctor who’s
good and then work on communicating your needs so the doctor can effec-
tively serve you. Too many people with bipolar disorder bounce around from
doctor to doctor, never settling on a consistent, integrated treatment plan.
242
Part IV: Helping Yourself 

Leaning On Others
Independence is highly overrated. Teenagers crave it until they actually get 
it and then it isn’t fun anymore. As you get older (and wiser), you begin to
appreciate interdependence — serving other people’s needs and having
others serve your needs. That’s what family, community, and society are 
all about, and that’s what individuals strive for, consciously or not.
When bipolar disorder hits, it makes you dependent. And whatever age you
are, dependence stinks. You no longer feel like an equal. Other people and
other things have control. What bothers people most is that they can’t (at
least temporarily) reciprocate. They feel like they’re going to a pitch-in
dinner without a casserole.
The psychological burden of being dependent can be tough to bear, but the
following realizations may help lighten your load:
 Bipolar disorder is an illness. When you’re in bed with a cold and
people bring you chicken soup, do you feel guilty?
 People need to be needed. When you need help, you fulfill other
people’s need to be needed. Don’t you feel good about helping your
friends or relatives?
 People need you. You’re an individual with unique insight, skills, and
vision. People need you; they want you to be well; and they want to
invest in your recovery.
 Your instability is temporary. You may be looking at a lifetime of med-
ication, but your moods will stabilize; you’ll regain control of your life;
and you’ll be able to contribute to your community.
No matter what you’re going through, you can benefit from the support of
people who’ve been there. After diagnosis and treatment, the support of
others is vital. Support groups, like those we describe in Chapter 6, can pro-
vide you with a “been there, done that” community of caring individuals.
Don’t overlook this tremendous resource.

Assisting a Friend
or Relative with
Bipolar Disorder

In this part . . .
A
fter you discover that a loved one has received a
bipolar diagnosis, you may experience a flurry of
emotions ranging from relief and hope to guilt and
despair, but regardless of what you feel, your loved one
needs you now more than ever. Your job, as a friend or
family member, is to build empathy, lend a hand, and
avoid the temptation of becoming too overbearing, all
without letting the disorder drag you down. Supporting a
friend or relative who has bipolar disorder can be a daunt-
ing challenge, primarily because the person wants your
help the least when he or she needs it the most.
We’ve been there, and in this part, we reveal what we’ve
learned in the trenches. Here, you find out what you can
do to support your loved one, when you should step in,
and when you should step back. We provide advice on
how to plan ahead for a crisis and how to keep your eye
on the ball when bipolar throws you a curve. And in the
final chapter of this part, we explain some of the chal-
lenges of diagnosing, treating, and supporting a child or
adolescent with bipolar disorder.

 Realizing what you can and can’t do to help
 Fostering a low-intensity atmosphere
 Setting parameters for when to call for help

L
ives are interwoven. They overlap, intersect, and ignite one another like
passing flames. If you have kids, you know how heartbreaking it is when
you hear them cry and how joyous you feel observing their talents and
achievements. When a friend or family member experiences a loss, it drags
you down. When you feel excited and elated, everyone around you lights up.
When bipolar disorder afflicts a friend or relative, the disorder afflicts you,
too. Symptoms can confuse and bewilder you, strain your relationship with
your loved one, and leave you physically and mentally drained. You want to
help, but how? What can you possibly do to remedy a “chemical imbalance”
in the brain? What can you say to your loved one when he loses all hope?
What can you do when your friend seems determined to blow her retirement
money and ruin her marriage? And how can you help when your loved one
resists your attempt to intervene and answers your well-intentioned advice
with arrogance and condescending anger?
In this chapter, we confront the confusion and the sense of helplessness that
friends and family members of people with bipolar disorder commonly face.
We explain the cold, hard facts about bipolar disorder to prepare you for the
struggles ahead; we provide exercises to steer you clear of any tendencies
you may have to blame yourself or your loved one for what has happened;
and we reveal what you can and can’t do to help your loved one on the road
to recovery. We also offer suggestions on how to properly care for yourself
and find support so that you and your loved one can step out from the
shadow of bipolar disorder and into the light of a hopeful future.

Establishing the Right Mindset
Becoming an effective caregiver and support person has as much to do with
what you think as it does with what you do. If you approach your role with
false expectations and misunderstandings, you may be more apt to say and
do all the wrong things, become easily frustrated, and blame yourself for situ-
ations and events that are completely outside your control. By establishing
the right mindset, you can function more effectively as a support person and
maintain your mental health.
In this section, you find out how to establish the right mindset by adjusting
your expectations, realizing that the disorder is something that your loved
one can’t control, and continually reminding yourself that you’re not respon-
sible for your loved one’s condition.
Forming realistic expectations
We all need hope, but false hope can lead to disappointment and frustration.
It can also cause you to let down your guard. In the case of caring for a loved
one with bipolar disorder, you may begin to think your problems are fixed,
the illness is cured, and that you’ve “put all this behind you.” If you do,
you’re likely to drift back into old patterns that create fertile ground for
mania or depression to take root. You forget about the medications. You
become less vigilant of the warning signs. You get careless. And bam! You’re
right back where you were, watching your loved one battle a major depres-
sion or a manic episode.
To help your loved one win the battle against bipolar disorder, you first need
to establish the right mindset and confront the realities of the disorder:
 Your loved one is and will remain vulnerable to future mood episodes.
 Your loved one can’t will himself or herself to overcome the illness.
 Preventive medication is required to prevent relapse and control 
symptoms.
 Even with preventive medication, symptoms may recur.
 You and your loved one may need to adjust your future expectations and
your lifestyles to improve the prognosis.
 Your loved one may not want your help at times, but he or she always
needs your love and understanding.
We don’t want to be the messengers of gloom and doom. You and your loved
one have every reason to look forward to remission and a wonderful life, but
your loved one needs to stick to the treatment plan, and you both need to
remain vigilant when times are good so you can short-circuit escalating moods.
248
Part V: Assisting a Friend or Relative with Bipolar Disorder 

Disassociating the disorder 
from the one you love
Your loved one personifies bipolar disorder for you. The disorder expresses
all its negative symptoms through your loved one’s actions and words, making
it very tempting to associate the disorder with the person, to identify the
victim as the perpetrator, and to blame your loved one for any problems that
the disorder may have caused.
To successfully battle the disorder, you and your loved one need to form an
alliance, and to do so, you need to disassociate the disorder from the person
who has it. In the midst of a major mood episode, disassociation is easier
said than done, but when you have a moment to contemplate, try the follow-
ing exercises:
 Think back to a time before the first major mood episode disrupted
your lives. Did the person you love seem different? In what ways? Can
you associate any specific behaviors with the disorder?
 Look at photographs of pleasant times that you and your loved one
experienced together. Did you notice any symptoms back then? What
has changed? Name some ways that the disorder affects your loved
one’s behavior during a mood episode.
 List all the words and behaviors that seem out of character with the
person you love. Would your loved one say and do the same things if he
or she were healthy? What would be different?
Be careful not to go too far when disassociating the disorder from your loved
one. You may be tempted to attribute every negative behavior to the disor-
der, even behaviors that are consistent with your loved one’s character. By
attributing too much to the disorder, you diminish the importance and value
of your loved one’s personality and ability to think on his or her own, which
can be just as damaging as attributing too little to the disorder.
Learning not to take it personally
When you’re on the receiving end of an angry tirade, and when nothing you
do seems to please your loved one, you may react by taking it personally and
becoming defensive. This reaction is perfectly natural, especially when you’re
in a close relationship with someone you love. Your happiness and the happi-
ness of your loved one may be intricately intertwined, and when one of you is
unhappy, the other suffers as well. You begin to think that if you could just
figure out the right way to act and the right words to say, the situation would
improve. When it doesn’t, frustration and bitterness often follow.
249
Chapter 16: Supporting Your Loved One

To overcome the common trap of taking it personally, try to depersonalize
your loved one’s hurtful words and deeds. Depersonalizing consists of
coming to terms with the fact that much of what your loved one says or does
has very little to do with you. Your loved one’s feelings, thoughts, reactions,
words, and actions can arise from multiple sources, including the following:
 Depression that makes your loved one overly sensitive, dejected, 
or pessimistic
 Mania that makes your loved one impatient, irritable, or unable to rein 
in behaviors
 Distorted thinking and paranoia secondary to depression, mania, 
or mixed states
You can’t sit down with a calculator to determine what percentage of your
loved one’s responses are valid reactions to something you say or do. But by
knowing that the disorder and other factors often contribute significantly
more to your loved one’s behavior than anything you say or do, you can blow
off some of the reactions and become less defensive.
Don’t blame yourself. Don’t blame your loved one. Blame the disorder.
Knowing What You Can 
and Can’t Do to Help
You stand by and watch the drama unfold. The doctor diagnoses and pre-
scribes, the therapist counsels and educates, and your loved one wrestles
with mood swings. You wander backstage like a lonely understudy, wonder-
ing if you’ll have a role to play and something to contribute.
Naturally, you want your loved one to get well, but the situation is totally new
to you. Should you get out of the way so the doctor and therapist can do
their jobs? Should you take control? What would be most helpful? And how
can you avoid making matters worse? The first step in becoming an effective
support person is to determine what you can and can’t do to help, and that’s
what this section is all about.
What you can do
Your presence, patience, understanding, and willingness to help are perhaps
the most valuable gifts you can present. Beyond that, you can offer many
types of help, but keep in mind that if your loved one is an adult, he or she
250
Part V: Assisting a Friend or Relative with Bipolar Disorder 

has the option of accepting or rejecting your offers or limiting your level of
involvement. Being too pushy or overbearing can cause feelings of resentment
and additional resistance to treatment. Here are some ways you can help:
 Learn about bipolar disorder and its symptoms and treatments, which
you’re already doing by reading this book.
 Keep in touch, especially during the rough times.
 Provide unconditional love and encouraging words while setting bound-
aries to keep your emotional reserves intact (such as “I need you to only
call me three or four times in one day”).
 Reassure your loved one that with the proper treatment, she will eventu-
ally manage the symptoms.
 Encourage your loved one to seek professional help when necessary
(but don’t nag).
 Assist in locating a qualified doctor and therapist.
 Assist in following up on insurance coverage and claims.
 Assist in tracking moods and medications and watching for signs of
impending mood episodes.
 Attend appointments with your loved one’s doctor and therapist, if
you’re welcomed by all parties.
 Call your loved one’s employer to report illness, being careful not to
pass along any details that your loved one may not want to share.
 Keep other friends and family members posted as directed by your
loved one.
 Perform basic household tasks, such as grocery shopping, watching the
kids, and paying bills.
 Remain patient.
What you can’t do
Bipolar disorder has stricken your loved one, not you (directly, that is).
Through research, communication, and therapy, you can develop a feeling of
empathy for your loved one, but you can never fully understand what she
experiences or how she views this illness in the context of her life. Moreover,
you can’t control how your loved one chooses to deal with it. If your loved
one is an adult, you can’t force her to take medication, attend therapy, or
even get sufficient sleep. If you attempt to take control, you risk taking owner-
ship of a problem you can’t fix.
You can and should step in at times when the illness makes your loved one
incapable of making the right decisions, but the rest of the time your job is to
251
Chapter 16: Supporting Your Loved One

let go and allow your loved one to manage on her own. Your loved one needs
to take responsibility for sticking with the treatment plan:
 Making and keeping doctor’s appointments
 Making and keeping therapy appointments
 Taking the mood medications as prescribed
 Avoiding mood-altering substances
 Getting sufficient sleep
 Asking for help
You didn’t cause your loved one to get bipolar disorder, nor can you cure it.
Don’t feel guilty for the onset of bipolar disorder, and don’t think that you
have the power or the resources to fix the problem on your own.
What you shouldn’t do (or say)
If you feel confused, hurt, helpless, and alone, multiply that by 10, and you
still can’t begin to approach the level of psychological pain and frustration
that your loved one feels. Many of her emotions and behaviors are out of her
control; most of the people she deals with on a daily basis don’t understand;
the condition significantly affects both her personal and professional life; and
she’s continually adjusting to the fact that she has a chronic, often unpre-
dictable condition. This burden understandably makes your loved one much
more sensitive and vulnerable to any words and actions pertaining to the ill-
ness, so try your best to avoid doing or saying anything to cause additional
pain. For instance:
 Don’t assume that the disorder or a missed medication causes every
argument.
 Don’t nag. (You can remind your loved one of a doctor’s appointment or
a medication dose, but only if you both agree that this is an acceptable
role for you to play.)
 Don’t tell your loved one how she feels or should feel. You don’t 
really know.
 Don’t talk to your loved one’s doctor or therapist behind her back,
except in the case of an emergency (you fear that your loved one will
harm herself or others).
 Don’t joke about the disorder unless your loved one accepts your joking,
and then joke about it only to your loved one, not to friends or other
family members.
 Don’t assume that just because your loved one didn’t want or need help
one day that she doesn’t want or need help another day.
252
Part V: Assisting a Friend or Relative with Bipolar Disorder 

 Don’t expect your loved one to be mentally sharp at all times. Some of
the medications can slow her thought processes and negatively affect
her memory.
 Don’t hesitate to ask questions. Most people who have bipolar disorder
are willing to discuss it with people who show a genuine interest in
learning more and helping.
 Don’t try to live your loved one’s life for her. She can make her own deci-
sions, although you may need to help during times of crisis or when she
asks. Encourage her to own her illness and its treatment, and instill a
belief that she’ll be able to manage her life better as she recovers.
Treat your loved one like you treat anyone else you love and respect. Trust
your loved one to make the right decisions concerning her life and her treat-
ment, step in when she can’t make decisions for herself, and ask questions
when you don’t understand.
Cultivating a Healthy Home Environment
If your relative or friend with bipolar disorder lives with you, your home
becomes his sanctuary, and everyone in your home becomes a caregiver. No,
you don’t need to dress in scrubs and talk in hushed tones. All family mem-
bers just need to get up to speed on bipolar disorder and work together to
create an environment that’s more conducive to your loved one’s recovery
and to the mental well-being of the entire household.
In this section, you discover various ways to structure your schedule, tone
down the emotional volume, set and enforce house rules, and strengthen
relationships that suffered through the course of the illness and from other
contributing factors.
Educate all household members
Everyone in your home, from Grandma to your toddler, should know the
basics of bipolar disorder, how it affects your loved one, and what the family
can do to help. If everyone is on a different page, you often see people work-
ing at cross-purposes and undermining any potential progress. If you have
people in the household who “don’t believe in medication,” for example, they
may make offhand comments that discourage your loved one from taking his
medication.
Encourage open communication. A common mistake family members make is
to begin discussing issues without involving the person who has bipolar dis-
order. You shouldn’t create a secret society with the goal of protecting your
253
Chapter 16: Supporting Your Loved One

loved one. This can make him feel as though everyone wants to gang up on
him — as if he’s the family problem. You enjoy much more success if every-
one is involved in the discussion and has an opportunity to ask questions
and voice concerns. Consult your loved one with bipolar disorder to deter-
mine the best time and the most effective way of opening the discussion and
presenting the information. Having other household members read this chap-
ter is a good way to start.
Establish a structured schedule
People who have bipolar disorder are much more sensitive to schedule varia-
tions. You may have no problem going to sleep at 10 p.m. one night and mid-
night the next or pulling an all-nighter on Saturday and sleeping in on Sunday.
These same variations can flip a person with bipolar disorder into mania,
with or without the protection of medication.
Some households can function quite well with individual family members fol-
lowing different schedules, but if the person with bipolar disorder tends to
depend on the rhythms of other family members, the entire family may need
to work together to establish a schedule and routine that works for everyone.
If Junior likes to have his buddies over on Friday night to play video games
until 2 a.m., but it disturbs the rest of the household, he may need to move
the party to a friend’s house or reschedule it for earlier in the evening.
Crank down the volume
Some households have a decibel level that rakes the nerves. As a visitor, it
can make you feel like you’re sitting in front of the high school band’s cymbal
player, just waiting for the crash to resonate between your ears. Thrilling?
Maybe, but it also increases stress to a level that begins to negatively affect
mood stability.
You don’t want to turn your home into the neighborhood “SHHHH!” zone, but
everyone should be aware of how their voices, stereos, and televisions affect
the person in the house who’s most sensitive to them. Crank down the
stereo, the TV set, the computer speakers, and other noise producers; limit
the shouting from room to room; and avoid slamming doors, banging pots
and pans, and bouncing balls off the walls.
Reduce the level of expressed emotion
The emotional tone of a family resonates with all its members, and family
members who are vulnerable to depression or mania are particularly sensitive
254
Part V: Assisting a Friend or Relative with Bipolar Disorder 

to the tone. In fact, some studies show that in families that have high levels of
expressed emotion, people who have had a major mood episode are much
more likely to suffer a relapse.
Expressed emotion is defined as levels of criticism, hostility, and emotional
overinvolvement directed toward the person with the mood disorder. It can
take form in the following types of communications:
 Criticism
 Blame
 Sarcasm (even when mumbled incoherently)
 Eye rolling
 Sighs
 Door slamming
Any emotional expression that can make a loved one feel nervous, anxious,
angry, frustrated, or guilty (for having the disorder) is an expressed emotion.
Every family member must be a caregiver to some degree, so all family mem-
bers must work together to establish a healthier emotional tone. The follow-
ing three approaches can contribute significantly to cranking down the
volume of expressed emotion:
 Learning more about the disorder typically increases empathy for the
afflicted family member, thus reducing any expressions of criticism,
blame, and emotional overinvolvement.
 Improving communication skills helps family members express them-
selves in healthier ways. You discover how to listen to one another and
express yourselves in a peaceful manner.
 Enhancing problem-solving skills enables you to resolve issues logi-
cally and rationally.
Lowering the level of expressed emotion doesn’t mean sucking all emotion
out of the family. The goal isn’t to transform your family into zombies, but to
enable you to express your emotions in healthier, more positive ways. (For
more on keeping things fun, see the section “Have some family fun” later in
this chapter.)
Avoid conflict by setting limits
You can eliminate many areas of conflict by having family members set clear
limits. As a caregiver, you can specify the types of language and behavior that
you refuse to tolerate from other family members, including the person who
has bipolar disorder. The person with bipolar disorder can also benefit by defin-
ing the type of help he wants and the language and behavior he can tolerate.
255
Chapter 16: Supporting Your Loved One

Setting limits and communicating those limits offers several advantages,
including the following:
 Reduces confusion. All parties know the rules and what happens if
someone crosses the line.
 Eliminates nagging. Your loved one knows what you expect, so you
don’t need to remind him.
 Eliminates criticism. You don’t need to criticize family members for not
respecting your limits; you simply react with the previously agreed-upon
response.
 Eliminates the need for arguments. You cross the limit, and the identi-
fied response follows, no questions asked.
 Settles your mind. You don’t constantly wonder what you can put up
with and how much you can take.
 Enables unconditional love. You can control your personal space with-
out taking unacceptable behaviors personally. You can respond in previ-
ously agreed-upon ways that don’t include withdrawing your love or
attention.
 Encourages independence. Unclear limits lead to endless conflict —
constant discussions about how to handle every situation — often
repeating the same cycles ad nauseum. Given clear boundaries, individu-
als can make choices about their behaviors independently, with full
awareness of the responses they can expect.
Effective limit-setting is a fine art that requires a detached toughness. You need
to set realistic limits and devise responses that not only make your family feel
comfortable, but also discourage your loved one from testing your limits and
allow for him to recover his appropriate behavior patterns and get back on
track. The following suggestions can help you set limits more effectively:
 Identify one or two of the most troublesome behaviors. Let the little
stuff go. Pick one or two behaviors that you simply can’t tolerate. As a
caregiver, a problem behavior may be that your loved one abuses alco-
hol or spends money excessively. If you have bipolar disorder, a prob-
lem behavior may be that your caregiver nags you or makes insensitive
comments about your condition.
 Pick behaviors that you can easily measure. Whether or not a person
arrives home at a specific time is easy enough to determine. Whether or
not a person treats you civilly is a judgment call.
 Assign appropriate consequences. With children, you can identify con-
sequences and then follow through on them, such as limiting television
or computer time or withholding allowance. Similar consequences are
inappropriate for adults — they infantilize the person, taking away his
adult decision-making abilities and making him feel like a child. Unless
you have a true safety crisis on your hands, you want to optimize the
256
Part V: Assisting a Friend or Relative with Bipolar Disorder 

other person’s responsible decision-making. For adults, appropriate con-
sequences are your responses to the unacceptable behavior. You can’t
actually change another person’s behavior; you can only change your
own, so responses can include disengaging briefly from the conversation
until your loved one cools down or stepping out of a planned activity
until appropriate behaviors return. Make sure these are consequences
you can live with so you can stick to them.
 Clearly communicate your limits and the associated consequences.
You can’t expect your loved one to respect your limits if you don’t
inform him of those limits. Go over your limits and consequences at a
time when emotions are stable, not during times of turmoil. You may
need to write them down.
 Enforce your limits consistently. Without consistent enforcement and
reinforcement, consequences become nothing more than idle threats.
This may take a great deal of self-discipline on your part. The more con-
sistent you are, the less you may need to enforce the consequences.
Setting limits doesn’t mean transforming a person into the ideal human being,
whatever that is. It means communicating your inability or unwillingness to
tolerate certain words or actions in your presence or in your home. You can’t
control your adult loved one, but limits provide you with tools you can use to
influence your loved one’s behavior.
Have some family fun
Cultivating healthy relationships means more than just avoiding conflict and
“getting along.” It requires that you and your loved ones have meaningful dis-
cussions and share experiences that increase intimacy and strengthen bonds.
When bipolar disorder enters a relationship, you can become so caught up in
crisis intervention and damage control that you lose touch with each other
emotionally. Encourage your loved ones to become more involved in family
activities, including the following:
 Meal preparation
 Physical activities
 Religious or spiritual activities
 Family outings
 Family meetings to discuss plans and issues that arise
Mood medication and therapy can do wonders when it comes to controlling
the symptoms of bipolar disorder, but even a successful combination of med-
ication and therapy is rarely sufficient to return functionality — a person’s
ability to carry out duties as a family member, friend, or worker. Functionality
typically improves as an individual begins to perform various activities in a
supportive environment and gradually increases his level of involvement.
257
Chapter 16: Supporting Your Loved One

Take breaks from one another
Two people may make for good company for a few days, but after a couple
weeks, even two begins to feel like a crowd, especially when you have to deal
with a long-term health condition. You don’t need to stand 24-hour watch
over a loved one who has bipolar disorder. It isn’t healthy for you, and it cer-
tainly isn’t healthy for your loved one. When his moods are cycling, you may
need to spend more time and energy as a caregiver, but when his moods sta-
bilize, take a break to recharge your batteries and connect with other friends
and acquaintances.
Encourage your loved one to do the same. After an extreme mood episode,
he may withdraw from friends or acquaintances and need some encourage-
ment to re-establish his connections. Simply mentioning that a friend or rela-
tive would like to hear from him may be enough to encourage a phone call 
or e-mail.
What about the kids?
If you have children living with you, they suffer from the fallout of bipolar dis-
order as well. As a guardian, you may need to physically protect your chil-
dren from any harm during extreme mood episodes, but preventing them
from learning about the disorder is usually a mistake. Perhaps even more
than adults, children need to understand what’s going on; otherwise, their
developing brains, which are still self-centered, shift into high gear, and they
may think that they’re the reason why Mommy and Daddy are fighting, why
Daddy can’t get out of bed to play ball, or why Mommy’s crying.
When explaining bipolar disorder to young children, use age-specific lan-
guage. “Depression” and “mania” may mean nothing to a 5-year-old, but if you
explain that “Mommy gets really excited sometimes and can’t calm down” or
that “Daddy can’t help getting really sad, even when everything is okay,” a
child is more likely to understand. Explain everything — symptoms, medica-
tion, therapy, support groups, and so on — and then leave some time for
questions and answers. Encourage your children to express their perceptions
and emotions.
Your kids have to grow up with bipolar disorder, and they have a right to
know what’s going on. Consider this an educational opportunity that not 
only helps you bond with your children, but also provides them with a better
understanding of their family and the world at large. Knowledge and under-
standing improve your child’s ability to be resilient in the face of this chal-
lenge. (For information on raising a bipolar child, head to Chapter 18.)

Remaining Vigilant for Warning Signs
One of the more sinister characteristics of bipolar disorder is that the person
who has it may not be able to recognize the onset of symptoms until it’s too
late to interrupt the cycle. To keep your loved one’s moods in check, she
needs to have one or two friends or family members who have close, regular
contact with her to remain vigilant of behaviors that may signify a major
mood episode.
Not everyone has the knowledge, temperament, and sensitivity to take on
this job. You don’t want a Barney Fife personality who gets rattled easily and
points out every blip on the mood radar, nor do you want someone who’s so
unaffected that major mood swings go unnoticed. The ideal candidate has
the following qualifications:
 Knows and can identify the signs of an oncoming mood episode
 Has close, regular contact with the person who has bipolar disorder
 Can openly communicate observations without instigating conflict
 Has permission to contact the person’s therapist or doctor
259
Chapter 16: Supporting Your Loved One
Arnie’s kids
Arnie came from a long line of family members
with bipolar disorder and other mood disorders.
His mother suffered from depression, his grand-
father was an “eccentric recluse,” and his
father suffered from rage attacks and alco-
holism. His work life had stalled in many ways
after numerous big ideas collapsed, and his cre-
ative periods were followed by long periods of
fatigue and fruitless labor. He was sure, how-
ever, that he was different from his parents and
that he wasn’t going to let himself “be labeled.”
Arnie’s marriage fell apart in his early 40s, pri-
marily due to his moodiness and unpredictable
behavior, but he still didn’t acknowledge the
possibility of a mood disorder. Over the next few
years, his children became more and more
aware of his difficulties and started to avoid him
because his visits were so chaotic. Arnie was
devastated, but he finally got in to see a doctor,
who diagnosed him with bipolar disorder and
began a treatment plan. Arnie’s children, all in
their early teens, were relieved to hear about
the diagnosis and eagerly supported Arnie’s
treatments. Their visits became opportunities
for honest conversations that brought the kids
and Arnie closer together. His oldest daughter
did a research project on bipolar disorder for
her health class and collected articles and Web
links to give to Arnie. They finally had an expla-
nation for his difficulties, and they came up with
plenty of ideas for ways to help him.

During a period of relative calm, consult your loved one to determine if she’s
willing to allow one or two people to help monitor her moods. Avoid getting too
many people involved or being overly involved yourself. Too much vigilance
and focus can make your loved one feel as though she lives in a fishbowl.
Knowing when to step in
Most people who live with bipolar disorder know the way the disorder pre-
sents itself in their lives. They may not notice it all the time, but they look
back later and recognize repeating behavioral patterns. For some, increased
shopping is a sign of ensuing mania; others may look to heightened sexuality,
self-harm, brighter shades of makeup, or escalating irritability. Depression
can begin to make itself known through withdrawal from social activities, an
increased need for sleep, or an overly pessimistic view of life.
If your loved one agrees to let you monitor her moods and watch for warning
signs, ask for additional details to help you determine the severity of the
symptoms and the actions you should take:
 Make a list of common warning signs.
 Find out at what point you should be concerned enough to act.
 Determine the actions you should take, including relating your observa-
tions and concerns to your loved one, contacting the therapist or doctor,
taking away credit cards or car keys, securing objects the person could
use to harm herself, or contacting another support person for assistance.
Everyone has good and bad days. Don’t assume that just because your loved
one is irritable or seems a little down in the dumps, you need to contact her
doctor or therapist. You should be a little more vigilant and convey your con-
cerns, but try not to overreact.
Knowing when to step back
In the midst of a major mood episode, don’t step back simply because your
loved one requests that you do so. Stick with her until she takes steps to
obtain the treatment necessary to stabilize her moods. Encourage your loved
one to contact her doctor or therapist immediately for evaluation and consul-
tation. A short visit with a qualified therapist is often enough to get your
260
Part V: Assisting a Friend or Relative with Bipolar Disorder 

loved one back on the right track, and if the therapist notices any disturbing
behavior, he’ll have a better idea of how to proceed.
When the crisis abates, and your loved one regains control of her moods, be
prepared to step back and let her manage her life once again. Let her know
that you’re there if she needs anything.
Let’s make a deal: Drawing up a contract
During a period of relative calm and stability, sit down with your loved one
and draw up a treatment contract, as shown in Figure 16-1. A useful contract
should contain the following information:
 Descriptions of external signs and symptoms of depression and mania
 Descriptions of verifiable signs that your loved one can manage the dis-
order on her own
 Descriptions of observable signs that your loved one needs help
 Instructions on the types of help your loved one agrees to accept
 A clear statement that you may do whatever you think is best when 
you suspect that your loved one faces an imminent risk of harming 
herself or others
Taking Care of Yourself
As a caregiver, you may feel lonelier than a guy at Tupperware party. Friends
and family may ask how your loved one is doing, showing little concern for
how you’re holding up. Even worse, your circle of friends may scatter, per-
haps out of fear, ignorance, or the mistaken belief that you don’t want them
“meddling” in your affairs. If you let this behavior continue, you and your
loved one may become isolated.
Isolation isn’t healthy for you or your loved one. If you mope around, con-
sumed by thoughts of the life you lost and the added responsibilities you
bear, your loved one will recognize the pain in your expressions and gestures
and feel the pangs of guilt. You need to blow off some steam, grieve for your
losses, attend to your needs, get a life, and then return to the relationship
refreshed and renewed.

Find support for yourself
Although your friend or relative may be the one who takes the direct hit from
bipolar disorder, you deal with a great deal of collateral damage. Suffering in
silence forces you to hold back feelings that eventually find expression
through blame and criticism. Try to find a healthy outlet for your emotions:
 Attend a support group for family members of people with mental ill-
nesses. A support group can provide a forum for sharing feelings and
information. As we discuss in Chapter 6, the Depression and Bipolar
Support Alliance (DBSA) provides free and confidential support groups
for family members, friends, and patients. One DBSA parent said, “When
you are a family member in the middle of a situation, it’s hard to see
what’s happening, but when you sit in a support group across from
someone who is going through the same thing, it gives you so much per-
spective and relief.” The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI)
also offers a selection of support groups and family-education programs.
Check out www.support4hope.com/Support_Groups.html for addi-
tional leads.
 Discuss problems with your family and friends. Feeling angry and bitter
over what you’re dealing with is normal, and you have every right to talk
about it openly, but you should do it in the right setting. Loading up your
loved one who has bipolar disorder with your emotional responses, no
matter how reasonable they are, only stirs up more negative feelings in
someone who’s poorly equipped to manage them.
 See a therapist. A therapist can help you through the grieving process
and provide you with an outlet for your emotions.
Get a life!
Bipolar disorder may be a part of your life, but it shouldn’t overshadow your
life. Don’t fall into the martyr syndrome, in which you sacrifice your life for
the life of your loved one. You have your own identity and your own life, so
start living it with some of the following activities:
 Connect with old friends.
 Pursue outside interests and hobbies.
 Get involved in community activities.
 Invite friends or family members to your home.
 Do something just for the heck of it once a week.

Planning Ahead for 
a Possible Crisis
In This Chapter
 Taking the time to make a plan
 Knowing when to take action
 Listing a roster of who to call for help (and who not to call)
 Protecting your loved one from dangerous behaviors
You’re too late. The intruder has already slipped past the protective bar-
riers of medication and therapy, entered the mind of your loved one, and
taken control. The erratic driving, the spending sprees, the racing thoughts,
and the irritability are already in high gear, and the intruder has convinced
your loved one that all is well — even better than usual. Or the intruder has
cranked down the speed, wrapping your loved one in darkness and despair
and forcing her to refuse your help and say, “There’s no hope.”
The time for asking your loved one what to do has passed. Would she want
you to call the doctor? What’s her doctor’s name, and where’s the phone
number? No, not the office number, the emergency number! Do you have con-
sent to talk with the doctor? Should you call another family member? If so,
who? And if you reach someone who can help, what do you say? What med-
ications is your loved one supposed to be taking? Has she been taking them?
Should you wrestle away the car keys? The credit cards? Is there a gun in the
house?
Now isn’t the time to be asking these questions. You should already have the
answers. If only you’d sat down with your loved one during a calmer period
and developed a crisis-intervention plan, you wouldn’t be so flustered now. You
may still have trouble convincing your loved one to get help, but at least you
have a solid plan in place and the information and resources to carry it out.
Don’t let this scenario happen to you and your loved one. This chapter pro-
vides a perfect opportunity for you both to develop a customized emergency
plan so that you’re prepared in the event of a crisis.

Making Time to Discuss the Plan
You know you need to discuss crisis planning with your loved one, but you
just don’t have the time, not to mention the inclination, to deal with it. You’ve
already invested more time and energy in controlling this condition than you
thought would be necessary, and now that life seems relatively normal, you
really don’t want to dredge up painful memories and admit the possibility of
a future crisis. You decide to take the path of least resistance — which just
happens to be a recipe for disaster.
To get over the speed bump of time constraints and emotional inertia, plan
ahead, and set some ground rules for getting the process going:
 Wait for a period of relative calm. Don’t try to plan for emergencies
when your loved one is actively manic or depressed. Attempting to have
a rational discussion, particularly when mania is involved, is an exercise
in futility. You may not have the luxury of waiting until the moods are
completely settled, but look for times of relative stability.
 Make an appointment. Put this meeting on your calendar just as you
would a meeting at work or a PTA gathering. Unless you provide advanced
notice and treat this meeting as a high-priority item, you’ll likely bump it
lower and lower on your to-do list with each passing day.
 Reduce distractions. Select a quiet place — no televisions, cell phones,
kids yammering for attention, or intrusive waiters. If you have kids, plan
the meeting for the school day, or arrange for a babysitter and head out
to a quiet place. Take a half day off work, if you have to — your efforts
will save you a lot more time down the road.
 Keep cool. Carefully monitor your mood temperature during the meeting,
and try to keep your emotions from overheating. You need to address
your frustrations and disappointments, but not in this setting. You’re con-
ducting a planning meeting, not a therapy session. Introducing your issues
shuts the meeting down before it gets started.
 Involve a third party. If this meeting seems likely to collapse into tears
or yelling, or you just can’t seem to get it going, consider asking a friend,
loved one, or even a therapist to be part of the process. An impartial
third party can act as a mediator, emotional thermostat, and taskmaster.
How Involved Should I Be?
After you carefully set aside the time and space to set up a crisis-intervention
plan, the first topic needs to be what role you should eventually play in the
event of a crisis. Will you play cheerleader, stepping in only when a crisis
looms? Will you act as a referral service, calling others when you sense trou-
ble? Or will you land a starting position on the mood-management team: going
266
Part V: Assisting a Friend or Relative with Bipolar Disorder 

to the doctor, managing medications, and assisting your loved one? When you
step in, how much power should you have? Consider some of the following
factors when drawing up guidelines for your involvement:
 Availability: Geography and time may limit your availability. Are you close
enough to your loved one to show up within moments of a problem, or do
you need to hop on a plane? Can you take time from work or household
responsibilities to devote to crisis prevention and management? Do you
have ready access to child care? Is your boss understanding?
 Past experience: Do you perform well during crises? If you’re the type
who faints when someone at the office gets a paper cut, or if you wig out
when the basement floods, perhaps you’re not the best person for the
job. You need to be able to keep a cool head, identify the signs of an
impending mood episode, and act rationally in the midst of chaos.
 How involved you were before the crisis: The more involved you’ve
been in everyday management, the more involved you can be in respond-
ing to crises. Have you been part of the everyday management of your
loved one’s care? Do you have a sense of the patterns that lead up to a
crisis? Do you know what’s been happening with your loved one’s med-
ications? Have you been talking with your loved one about the stresses in
her life? Or are you more on the sidelines — ready to take action only
when a crisis is brewing?
 Your boundaries: Do you want to have power of attorney so that you can
intervene with things like credit cards and bank accounts? Or do you want
to handle such issues informally? Does your loved one want you to know
about her finances? Will you be in this person’s home — pulling credit
cards and car keys? These issues are the nitty-gritty of your plan that you
must hammer out clearly in advance of any major problems. See Chapter
16 for more information.
 How much intervention your loved one can endure from you: If the
person you’re helping has patterns of becoming explosive or dangerous
during a crisis, you can do so only much before involving other levels of
intervention, such as a crisis team or hospital emergency room. Your role
in crisis management may have an early stopping point if your attempts to
help trigger outbursts or destructive reactions.
Defining the limits of your involvement depends a great deal on your and
your loved one’s temperaments and styles. You must identify her personal
preferences and what she feels are reasonable levels of involvement. Just as
important, you must communicate your comfort level for dealing with deeply
personal issues such as money and health care. Your level of involvement
isn’t a given; it’s a matter of negotiation. However, your loved one should
have someone on the support team who’s willing and able to step in during
a crisis.
267
Chapter 17: Planning Ahead for a Possible Crisis

When Should I Intervene?
Determining the proper intervention point can be quite a challenge. You don’t
want to hit the panic button whenever your loved one looks a little glum or
gets excited, but you also don’t want to wait until your loved one is acting
irrationally or is completely unreceptive.
Ideally, you’ll be able to communicate your observations and concerns to
your loved one well before a crisis occurs, assuming that you can identify the
warning signs early enough and that your loved one is open to feedback. In
such cases, you could mention that “you seem a little more talkative than
usual” or “you seem to really be dragging lately,” and your loved one knows
that you’re expressing the secret code for “you’re getting hypomanic” or
“you’re getting depressed.” After she accepts the situation, she can see her
doctor or therapist for evaluation and any necessary treatment.
In general, the longer you wait to communicate your observations and con-
cerns (perhaps because you don’t want to become overly involved or are
afraid that you’ll hurt your loved one’s feelings), the less receptive your loved
one will be.
If you feel doubt about when to speak up, the following guidelines may help:
 Act early and often. Work on establishing open communication with
your loved one about the disorder and how it affects her, as we explain
in Chapter 16. Such discourse gives you greater knowledge of the warn-
ing signs and improves your ability to identify them early. It also makes
your loved one more comfortable when sharing the illness with you and
others and more receptive to your observations and concerns. The
sooner you can identify a mood cycle and take action, the more likely
you are to be successful. As a mood cycle gains momentum, your loved
one’s resistance to your intervention is likely to increase, and your
efforts can backfire.
 Keep an eye on the mood journal. If you live with your loved one, you
may not notice the subtle escalation of mood from one day to the next,
but a quick glance at a one- or two-week period on a mood chart can
alert you to a growing problem. Again, the more you can communicate
openly with your loved one, the better your chances of gaining access to
mood charts or journals. Don’t peek without permission. (Chapter 12
has a mood chart you can copy for use.)
 Identify “red flag” behaviors. Is your loved one sleeping less? More? Is
she beginning to lose whole evenings to shopping or planning numerous
big projects? Is she eating more or less? Has your musician friend stopped
listening to music or playing instruments? Behavioral changes that indi-
cate trouble are often very unique to the individual.
268
Part V: Assisting a Friend or Relative with Bipolar Disorder 

 Err on the side of caution. You must balance your fear of hurting your
loved one’s feelings and making her angry with your desire to keep her
safe. You can’t manage everything in her life, but if you’re worried and
things don’t feel right, more action rather than less is the way to go.
Your loved one may be angry with you for taking action, but if it makes
a difference in her safety and survival, your efforts are well worth it.
If your friend or relative is talking about suicide or behaving recklessly, you
must act immediately. If she can’t or won’t listen to you, call for help, as we
instruct later in this chapter in the section “Suicide.”
Whom Should I Call for Help?
When you create your crisis-intervention plan, address the issue of who may
become involved and at what point. Make a list of the people that your loved
one wants you to contact and the people you consider helpful and then edit
as necessary. Cross people off the list who may cause more problems than
they solve; you both know who they are. Record your final list of names and
numbers on the crisis information form we provide in the section “Putting
Your Plan in Writing,” later in this chapter.
If the names of doctors and therapists are on the list, they can’t talk with you
unless they have signed consent forms from your loved one on file, so make
sure your loved one follows up on signing the necessary forms.
The following list provides an overview of the professionals, mood-management
team members, and others you may need to call in an emergency:
 Psychiatrist: If your loved one gives you consent to contact her psychia-
trist, that’s the best place to start. When you see red-flag signs or a wor-
risome pattern developing, let the doctor know early enough to allow for
a medication adjustment before a full-blown crisis. This step works even
better if you’ve met the doctor and if he knows that you’re a contact
person on the team. Encourage your loved one to describe her escalat-
ing symptoms to the psychiatrist, but if she can’t because of her emo-
tional state, step in, assuming you have consent.
 Therapist: If your loved one consents, contact her therapist early enough
so she can receive effective treatment. Even if you’ve already contacted
the psychiatrist, giving the therapist a heads-up can provide additional
support. Again, meeting the therapist before the crisis is tremendously
helpful, because he knows who you are and what your role is.
 Other nonprofessional support people: Your friend or relative may
have identified spouses, parents, siblings, friends, and others as people
to call. Bringing them into the mix tightens the support network. Early
on, you may have to call other members of the mood-management team
269
Chapter 17: Planning Ahead for a Possible Crisis

for a second opinion on behaviors or patterns you’ve observed. If the
mood cycle begins to escalate, you may need to call for additional 
assistance.
 The crisis team: Most municipalities — often at a county or district
level — have crisis teams available to assess mental health patients
rapidly. Sometimes these teams are based in hospitals, but in many
cases, they can come to your home to do the assessment. If the crisis is
quickly spinning out of control, or if you can’t reach the doctor or thera-
pist, contacting the crisis team is your next step. You can call the crisis
team without consent if you feel that your loved one is in danger of hurt-
ing herself or someone else. Obtain this phone number in advance; it
can be tough to track down, even during the best of times.
 The hospital or emergency room: If the situation is getting unsafe or
out of hand, and your loved one will cooperate, take her to a hospital
emergency room or to a predetermined psychiatric hospital for admis-
sion. The psychiatrist may refer you in this direction. Unlike an emer-
gency room, you should call the psychiatric hospital before showing up,
because it may not have a bed available. In that case, you proceed to a
second hospital on the list or the emergency room. In your crisis plan,
you should identify the hospitals that work with your loved one’s insur-
ance plan and doctors, and make sure you know how to call the hospi-
tals and how to get there. See Chapter 3 for tips on preparing for a stay
in the hospital.
 911 or the police: If you sense imminent danger, call for backup from
professionals who can act immediately. What’s “imminent danger?” Your
loved one is in imminent danger if she:
• Threatens suicide
• Rages toward others
• Makes threats
• Acts so disorganized that travel becomes unsafe
• Refuses or is unable to cooperate
Calling the police isn’t something that anyone wants to do to a friend or
family member, but if you see a dangerous situation, and your loved one
won’t or can’t go with you to the emergency room, call for help.
Keep in mind that you may have to call more than one person on your list. If
you’re trying to act early, and dangerous symptoms aren’t present, you’re
more likely to deal with the doctor and therapist. If you’re acting during a
dangerous episode, you’re likely to call the hospital or 911, but you need to
call the psychiatrist and therapist as well.
270
Part V: Assisting a Friend or Relative with Bipolar Disorder 

Bring your list of contact information to the emergency room or hospital. This
saves a lot of time for the admitting team. Also keep an updated list of medica-
tions with your contact list so you can tell the healthcare professionals exactly
which medications and doses your loved one is supposed to be taking.
Preventing Risky Behavior
People think nothing of buckling up for safety or wearing a bicycle helmet,
but they often hesitate to take car keys away from someone who’s driving
recklessly or to snatch credit cards from someone whose spending is out of
271
Chapter 17: Planning Ahead for a Possible Crisis
Having your loved one admitted involuntarily
Involuntary hospitalization is the process of
admitting someone to a psychiatric hospital
against his will. It can only happen in three 
situations:
 The person poses a danger to himself.
 The person is a danger to others.
 The person can’t care for himself.
This is an easier process in some states than in
others, but all states require a physician to eval-
uate the person for danger and risk level before
he can be admitted involuntarily to a hospital.
You can’t “sign commitment papers,” like
people do in the movies. The legal system con-
siders commitment a medical process and
requires that a professional — and in many
states, two professionals — identify the person
as being a high-risk threat to self or others. The
initial hospitalization lasts only a few days;
keeping a person hospitalized against his will
beyond that period involves a court hearing,
which can sometimes occur at the hospital.
During the 1960s, patients’ rights groups and
advocacy movements worked to enact laws
against involuntary commitment in order to err
on the side of patients’ rights. For the general
population, these laws are a positive step
toward increased freedom, but they can be
frustrating for family and friends who want to
help a loved one who refuses treatment.
According to these laws, you can’t force treat-
ment on someone until the person reaches a
danger level that can be legally and medically
established.
The issue of medicating a person against his
will also falls into this area. States vary widely in
their procedures, but action typically requires at
least one court hearing. Some states are devel-
oping so-called outpatient commitment proce-
dures that involve closely monitoring a person
who has a diagnosed mental illness (including
the person’s medication compliance). If the
person has a documented history of behavior
that threatens his own safety or the safety of
others, and if he requires medication to control
the behavior and stops taking the medication,
the law enables the state to move the person to
a hospital against his will. These programs are
designed for the most chronically ill patients
with the highest risk of dangerous behaviors.

control. When you and your loved one discuss crisis prevention and manage-
ment, confront these sorts of risky behaviors, and agree on a plan for dealing
with them. Your loved one’s prior approval to intervene can strengthen your
resolve to act forcefully during a crisis.
In this section, we list risky behaviors that are common to bipolar disorder
and provide suggestions for possible ways of dealing with them. How you
choose to deal with the behaviors is up to you and your loved one and often
requires some creative thinking and serious planning.
Also be aware that the clever plans you develop during your rational meeting
of minds may seem completely unacceptable to your loved one during a
mood episode — particularly a manic episode. Having a solid plan and taking
early action can increase your chances of success, but be prepared to meet
some strong resistance.
Reckless driving
Mania and depression can impair your loved one’s ability to drive safely. Mania
lifts inhibitions, essentially disabling the speed regulator inside the brain 
and pressing your friend or relative to disregard speed limits and defensive-
driving techniques. Depression can impair concentration and reflexes, 
slowing response times and resulting in erratic driving. A driver who feels
hopeless and despondent and who doesn’t care whether she lives or dies
may be unable to make safe driving decisions.
The obvious intervention in this case is to take away the car keys — obvious,
that is, until you consider some of the ramifications. Driving is central to
many of our lives and represents adulthood and independence. By grabbing
the car keys, you remove your loved one’s sense of independence and free-
dom and her ability to get to work, do her shopping, get to doctor’s appoint-
ments, and perform other tasks that help her stay on track and avoid a major
mood episode. Before you snatch the car keys, plan for these contingencies:
 Can someone get your loved one to work?
 How will your friend or relative get to the doctor and therapist?
 Who can pick up her kids, take them to soccer, and buy groceries?
Taking away the keys is the easy part. Keeping your loved one’s life going
afterward requires serious planning and attention to detail.
Runaway spending
Unrestrained spending is almost a cliché in stories about manic episodes. The
logical intervention is deceptively simple — hide the cash and checkbook,
272
Part V: Assisting a Friend or Relative with Bipolar Disorder 

snatch the credit and debit cards, and transfer the cash from the savings
account to an account that your loved one can’t touch. But mania has several
ways to work around these minor inconveniences and get to the cash it needs:
 Your loved one may memorize the credit card numbers.
 Account information may be stored on Internet shopping sites.
 Your loved one can still shop by phone.
 Credit cards are easy to apply for over the phone or on the Internet.
In order to stay one step ahead of the mania, you need to think creatively and
invent ways to counter these tactics:
 Contact the credit card companies to place a hold on the accounts.
Procedures may vary, depending on the companies and the state in
which you reside, so research the policies and credit card company
phone numbers ahead of time.
 Report the credit cards stolen. Technically speaking, the bipolar disor-
der has stolen them, so you’re not really lying. (Do this only in a pinch.)
 Inspect the mail for any new credit card applications. Most mailboxes
receive a steady stream of tempting offers; shred them, or simply write
“Return to Sender” on the envelope and drop it in the mail.
 Monitor your loved one’s Internet use and e-mail for any activity
regarding credit card applications or transactions. Obtain consent
from your loved one prior to doing this.
Of course, potential drawbacks accompany these clever plans. If your loved
one shares the accounts with a spouse or significant other, how can he or she
access money to buy groceries and pay bills? It makes sense to keep at least
one separate account that the person with bipolar disorder can’t access —
money available during a crisis. You may also want to keep the accounts in the
spouse’s name only to reduce the potential sources of money during a crisis.
Hypersexuality
Hypersexuality — a supercharged state of sexual confidence and desire — is a
diagnostic feature of mania that often results in risky sexual behavior. It stirs
up boatloads of trouble for the person with bipolar disorder and her family.
Trying to reduce these behaviors presents unique challenges. Sexual behav-
ior is private stuff. Without trailing the manic person 24/7, how can you pre-
vent dangerous sexual behavior? For starters, try the following:
 Take the car keys and credit cards. No car, no money, no sex. Well,
it may not be that easy, but taking driving and spending off the table
blocks the main access routes to unsafe sexual connections. Of course,
273
Chapter 17: Planning Ahead for a Possible Crisis

taking away the car keys and credit cards presents similar drawbacks,
which we discuss in the previous two sections.
 Restrict or monitor Internet access. The Internet provides 24-hour
access to a menu of sexual opportunities, including pornography, which
may be the least of your worries. Chat rooms, online dating sites, and
other virtual pickup joints are packed with people looking for sexual
connections. Pornography doesn’t carry the risk of sexually transmitted
diseases or pregnancy, but chat rooms and dating sites can lead to phys-
ical encounters.
Restricting Internet access also has some potential drawbacks that you
should discuss during your planning meeting. Can you restrict Internet
access without eliminating e-mail and work communications? Will your
loved one allow you to monitor her Internet activities? Tailor your plan
so that both of you feel comfortable with it and confident that it will pro-
duce the desired results. Talk, talk, and more talk is the only way to
cover all your bases.
Be careful not to encourage behaviors that you find enjoyable; for example, if
your spouse is hypersexual with you, you may welcome the extra attention
you’re getting. Remember, however, that the fun that comes with this extra
energy can easily get out of control. You need to do what’s best for the person
with the illness, not what feels good at the time.
Drug and alcohol abuse
Bipolar disorder doesn’t mix well with drugs or alcohol. In a person whose
inhibitions are already compromised, these substances melt away any ves-
tiges of good judgment. With depression, alcohol can result in a much higher
risk of completed suicide. Helping your loved one stay away from these
danger zones can be lifesaving, but your options are limited:
 Cut off access to money and transportation. If your loved one can’t
afford drugs and alcohol and can’t get to them, she can’t use them.
However, if she has access, she can still steal what she needs or trade
stuff for it.
 Restrict phone and Internet access. If a friend or acquaintance delivers
drugs or alcohol to your loved one, cutting off communications to the
outside world, if possible, can help block the courier route.
 Monitor your loved one’s activity. Keeping watch is incredibly intrusive
and restrictive for both you and your loved one, but standing guard is
the most effective option in controlling almost every risky behavior we
cover in this section. Obtain assistance from others, if possible, to
reduce your burnout.
274
Part V: Assisting a Friend or Relative with Bipolar Disorder 

Agreeing beforehand about the actions you must take to curb risky behavior
may make your loved one more receptive when the time comes for you to
monitor behavior and enforce limits. However, any action you take to restrict
behavior carries the risk of causing backlash. Your loved one may become
more secretive or even decide to rebel or run away. Prepare yourself for
these potential reactions, both psychologically and in your planning.
Suicide
A person with severe depression is at high risk for suicide. If you suspect that
your loved one may be considering suicide, take the following steps:
1. Keep watch, and don’t leave your loved one alone.
If you can’t stay around, call someone to come over and stay there until
your replacement arrives.

Chapter 17: Planning Ahead for a Possible Crisis
Julie’s college intervention
The crisis crept up slowly on Julie. She was a
college student and always bright and ener-
getic. She began to stay up very late at night
doing extra work for her classes and planning
multiple events for her sorority. She was thrilled
that even with such little sleep, she didn’t feel
tired. She even had the time and energy to party
with her friends all night — drinking and smok-
ing a little pot. She felt increasingly confident
and sought out companionship on the Internet
and at off-campus bars. She raced through her
credit card limit, buying new clothes for her
liaisons and her planned activities, so she
ordered a new card from the many offers she
received in the mail. Her schoolwork began to
drop off the radar.
Julie’s friends worried about her, but she told
them she had never felt better and that nothing
was wrong. She became snappy with friends
who voiced their concerns, and she began to
think that her friends wanted to ruin her life. She
even started to suspect that the college admin-
istration could have something to do with it.
When her closest friend contacted Julie’s par-
ents, she was enraged. She jumped in her car
to race home and clear things up. Halfway
home, an officer stopped her for speeding; she
was going about 100 miles per hour. The police
officer suspected that something was amiss,
because she was rambling and looked “out of
it.” He called for an ambulance, which took her
to the emergency room about an hour from
home. When her parents arrived, Julie was
paranoid and disoriented. They agreed to hos-
pitalization, which she fought but gave into
eventually. Over the next six months, she stabi-
lized on medications and returned to school.
Julie and her family and friends developed an
early warning system, particularly regarding her
sleep. If she began sleeping less, her friends
would call her parents. Julie’s friends also kept
her busy with activities other than drinking. Her
mood cycling persisted, but her support group
managed it well with early intervention, and
Julie eventually found a mix of meds that kept
her mood pretty even most of the time.

2. Listen, remain supportive by telling your loved one how much she
means to you, and encourage her to talk about her feelings.
Don’t try to argue at this point about why life is worth living, and don’t
dismiss her feelings.
3. Remove any weapons or medications that could assist a suicide attempt.
Don’t leave anything around that can make suicide an easy option.
4. Call your loved one’s doctor or therapist, or call 911.
If you can’t connect with the doctor or therapist, don’t hesitate to drive
your loved one to the emergency room or dial 911.
5. Get help from other friends or family members.
They can help support your loved one, as well as you, through the crisis.
Don’t be afraid to ask about suicidal thoughts. Your loved one won’t become
suicidal just because you ask questions — the risk comes from not asking.
Also, trust your perceptions and instincts. When dealing with a loved one
who’s becoming increasingly violent or suicidal, you may try to talk yourself
out of believing that something bad can actually happen. If the situation is
escalating, get help before it’s too late.
Putting Your Plan in Writing
Digging through your loved one’s purse or wallet for doctor names and phone
numbers or rummaging through the medicine cabinet to piece together pre-
scription information during a crisis is both bothersome and unnecessary.
The one thing you should walk away with from your crisis-planning meeting
is a single sheet of paper listing every piece of critical information you need
in the event of a crisis.
With the help of your loved one, fill out the Crisis Information Sheet shown in
Figure 17-1, distribute it to all the people on your mood-management team,
and keep it handy at all times.
Keep several copies of the Crisis Information Sheet on hand: one at home,
one at work, one in your purse or briefcase, and one on your computer or
PDA (Personal Digital Assistant). Update the information whenever your
loved one changes doctors or therapists or has a medication adjustment so
you have the most recent information at all times.

Responding in a Crisis
Depression and mania can both lead to situations that build up to a crisis or
an emergency situation. As a support person, your job is to quickly and accu-
rately assess the potential danger; keep cool; and take the necessary actions
to protect yourself, your loved one, and any others in close proximity. When
a crisis begins to brew, take the following steps to defuse it and obtain the
necessary treatment for your loved one:
1. Protect yourself and others.
If you feel that the situation endangers your safety or the safety of others
in the household, exit as soon as safely possible. If your loved one is vio-
lent or threatening, call 911; inform the dispatcher of any previous hospi-
talizations, and request that the police not brandish any weapons.
2. Defuse the situation, if possible.
Confronting an individual in the throes of mania or arguing with some-
one during a bout of depression is perhaps the worst thing you can
do. Remain calm and rational, talk in a soft tone, and encourage your
loved one to seek help voluntarily. Don’t threaten or try to restrain your
loved one.
3. Call your loved one’s doctor or therapist.
If you can’t reach the doctor or therapist, contact the local crisis team
or hospital. If your loved one is able, let him talk to the doctor or thera-
pist; otherwise, you do the talking. If your loved one has been taken
somewhere, provide the doctor or therapist with the necessary informa-
tion to follow up.
Being arrested and incarcerated are extremely traumatic events, especially
for people who suffer from a mental illness. Your goal is to get your loved one
to a hospital or other treatment center where he can obtain medication and
therapy. If your loved one commits a crime that someone witnesses, you can
petition for involuntary commitment rather than jail time. Jail isn’t where
your loved one needs to be.

S
omething’s not quite right with your child. She’s moodier than the other
kids — yelling at you one minute, crying uncontrollably the next. When
things don’t go the way she wants, she flies into a rage, sometimes breaking
her favorite toys or tearing up her artwork. She doesn’t have any close
friends, and just when you think she’s about to strike up a friendship, she
does something to drive her friend away. The entire household is on edge,
afraid that any wrong word or gesture will upset the delicate balance.
Need some advice? You’ll find plenty. When it comes to raising children,
everyone’s an expert. Comments about your child’s behavioral problems
come freely and loudly, and from all directions. Your family, your neighbors,
and even the lady behind you at the supermarket offer their expert advice
and observations: “She just needs a good spanking” or “She’s a spoiled brat!”
In your mind, you’re wrestling with guilt and fear, wondering what you did to
cause the problem and if you can do anything to make it better.
Trying to tough out the situation with advice from daytime television and the
neighborhood peanut gallery won’t work. This complicated medical problem
needs the same care and attention you’d give a child with diabetes or severe
asthma.
In this chapter, you discover how bipolar disorder typically affects children
and teenagers, and why the diagnosis is so tricky. You find out what an evalu-
ation should involve and how to obtain an evaluation for your child. We also
review the treatment options for a child with bipolar disorder and offer a
brief introduction to the world of special education services for children with
bipolar disorder.

Recognizing the Diagnostic Difficulties
Many adults with bipolar disorder will tell you that they had their first symp-
toms when they were kids, even though they didn’t recognize the symptoms
as symptoms back then. For a long time, psychiatrists thought that bipolar
disorder was only an adult problem and that children couldn’t get depressed
or manic. Until the late 1980s, most experts believed that children couldn’t
suffer from depression, but research from the past few decades has shown
that they clearly can. The question of mania has come up even more recently,
and professionals are still debating and discussing the issue.
Kids’ brains really are different from adult brains. Their neurons are still con-
necting and configuring to create a grown-up person. Just as babies must
babble before they talk, kids must have immature emotional reactions before
they can have mature ones. Human moods and behaviors become more
defined and modulated as people develop through childhood and adolescence.
When problems arise with moods and behaviors in kids, they can appear more
vague. In kids, bipolar disorder may exhibit some of the following differences:
 Duration: Depression and manic episodes may not compare to the full
duration of adult episodes. The two weeks of depression and the week of
mania or hypomania required by DSM-IV (see Chapter 2) for a diagnosis
of bipolar disorder aren’t always part of childhood bipolar disorder.
 Definition: The periods of depression and mania may not be as 
clear-cut — mixed types of episodes may be more prominent in many
children with bipolar disorder.
 Details: Children typically don’t go on a worldwide tour or a shopping
spree when manic; however, they may start spending all night counting
their baseball cards and begin “collecting” frantically, even stealing
cards from other kids.
Older adolescents often exhibit traditional bipolar symptoms. A common
onset age is late adolescence and early adulthood. In younger teens and espe-
cially in children under 12, the diagnosis is much trickier. During the earlier
years, children may simply appear overly angry, hyperactive, depressed, or
oppositional.
The angry kid
Plenty of kids throw fits — that’s their job. After all, they’re living, breathing
human beings with brains, and nobody likes to be told what to do. In junior
high, kids specialize in moodiness as they rebel against rules and authority and
test the boundaries of free expression. But sustained patterns of daily mood
and behavioral explosions, and a persistent inability to meet the demands of
daily life without falling apart, are red flags for mood disorders in kids.
280
Part V: Assisting a Friend or Relative with Bipolar Disorder 

Tantrums, a “short fuse,” and “mood swings” aren’t enough to officially diag-
nose bipolar disorder. The following general symptoms can arise from a host
of other causes and conditions:
 Unipolar depression: Frequent anger and tantrums can be symptoms of
childhood depression without mania. Adults with depression are often
irritable and short-fused. Depressed kids, with even less ability to express
their feelings clearly and fewer skills for managing unbearable sadness,
may seem really angry.
 Anxiety: Fears and worries can paralyze kids and make them unable to
carry out requests. They may be terrified of someone getting hurt at
home, for example, so they’re terrified of leaving the house to go school.
A battle rages over school every morning, complete with tears, flying
toys, kicking and biting, and gnashing of teeth. The child hasn’t clearly
identified the fear, so he just looks defiant.
 Obsessive-compulsive disorder: OCD is a subtype of anxiety disorder
in which kids have repeated irrational thoughts and fears, along with
behaviors that they must repeat over and over again to try to reduce the
fears. A child who must walk through doorways five times forward and
five times backward has a lot of trouble moving along with his class
through the hallways. He may not be able tell you what’s going on in his
head, or he tries to hide the behaviors because he’s embarrassed. The
result is a kid who looks as though he’s “oppositional,” with fits of anger
and “meltdowns.”
 Language and learning problems: Undiagnosed or undertreated lan-
guage and learning problems are wildly frustrating for kids. They can’t
do what teachers or parents ask of them, so they’re labeled “difficult,”
and no matter what they do, they can’t seem to succeed or change their
behaviors. They cycle into a pattern of failure, which leads to negative/
avoidance behaviors and explosions whenever they encounter demands.
 Sleep problems: Kids with irregular sleep patterns and difficulty staying
asleep can look terribly irritable and reactive when their bodies and
minds are simply tired.
 Medical problems: Migraine headaches, stomach problems, and
asthma are some of the most common ailments in children that can
cause irritability.
 Stress reactions: Chronic family conflict at home can cause kids to be
irritable and reactive. Illness or loss in the family, financial problems,
moving, new siblings, and substance abuse in the family can all wreak
havoc on a child’s ability to tolerate daily life without big, emotional
reactions. School situations can be just as overwhelming — being bul-
lied or having a fight with a teacher can cause severe emotional distress.
Not every angry kid has bipolar disorder. A brief interview isn’t adequate for a
diagnosis. Get a careful evaluation, preferably with a board-certified child-and-
adolescent psychiatrist, before you accept a bipolar diagnosis in your child.
281
Chapter 18: Backing Your Bipolar Child

The hyperactive kid
In children, ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) and bipolar dis-
order, particularly the mania, can look like identical twins. Some studies
show that large numbers of kids in psychiatric hospitals and kids diagnosed
with ADHD actually have bipolar disorder, although some experts suggest
that this claim may be an exaggeration. Distinguishing between mania and
ADHD is critical because their treatments are so very different. The stimu-
lants used to treat ADHD, such as Adderall and Ritalin, can wreak havoc with
a manic child, and mood stabilizers don’t help ADHD.
Shared symptoms between bipolar disorder and ADHD
To grasp just how challenging a child’s diagnosis can be, check out the fol-
lowing symptoms that bipolar disorder and ADHD share:
 Increased motor activity: In both conditions, kids “bounce off the
walls.” They can’t sit still, and they seem restless and easily bored.
 Increased talking: Both conditions often create “motor mouth,” where
kids talk constantly and can never seem to catch a breath. They often
interrupt conversations or pipe up with comments irrelevant to the dis-
cussion around them. They talk about what interests them without
paying attention to how other people respond. They blurt out feelings or
opinions that may hurt someone’s feelings or cause major problems.
 Poor impulse control: Increased motor activity and talkativeness are
examples of limited impulse control. In mania and ADHD, poor impulse
control is a core problem. Performing dangerous stunts without thinking
is the most problematic part of either diagnosis. A hyperactive or manic
kid may jump off bookshelves or dash across the street without realizing
the danger involved. Kids with ADHD are more likely to try drugs and
alcohol, just like kids with mania. Stealing and lying are common prob-
lems in both conditions. In manic and hyperactive teens, impulsive deci-
sions about sexual partners can present serious problems.
 Impatience/low frustration tolerance: More subtypes of impulse-control
problems. Kids who can’t wait their turn, who grab things from other kids,
or who melt down over minor frustrations can have ADHD or mania.
How can I tell the difference?
What are the differences between the two conditions? How do you sort them
out? In adults, the distinction is fairly straightforward. In kids, for several rea-
sons, the distinction can be more difficult. The following areas are important
to consider:
 Cycling: In bipolar disorder, the manic and hypomanic symptoms typi-
cally come in episodes. In ADHD, the impulse-control issues are chronic
and don’t shift markedly in severity or degree. Impulsivity certainly
shifts, but not to the degree of a cycling mood disorder.
282

 Change from baseline: To identify mania, you must notice a variation
from the norm — a person doesn’t feel like himself. With kids, they
may have always behaved like this, leaving you with no point of compar-
ison. Because a kid hasn’t lived as long, the manic behavior could be his
baseline — he may not have a “usual” state — but the doctor still looks
for evidence of shifts from a baseline as part of the diagnosis of a mood
disorder in your child.
 Grandiosity: Mania causes you to be full of yourself and quite certain
that you can do anything and everything that comes into your head.
Although kids with ADHD may act impulsively, overconfidence and the
tendency to misjudge their abilities aren’t parts of the ADHD diagnosis.
In fact, these kids typically struggle with low self-confidence and a sense
that that they’re doomed to failure. Grandiosity is a red flag for mania.
 Sleep disturbance: Kids with ADHD often have trouble quieting their
minds to sleep, making bedtime quite difficult. In mania, the entire
sleep/wake cycle is disturbed. These kids seem to need little sleep —
they stay up late, get up early, and keep on going. Kids experiencing
mania eventually crash and appear exhausted, but they typically have
periods of high energy with less need for sleep.
 Presence of “euphoric mood” episodes: Mania can be diagnosed in
someone with only angry, irritable moods, a symptom that’s also associ-
ated with ADHD. But the presence of euphoria — an expansive, overly
happy mood with a persistent sense that everything is “beyond wonder-
ful,” even when life throws its usual curve balls — is much more likely in
bipolar disorder than in ADHD.
Could my child have both?
How common is it for kids with bipolar disorder to also have ADHD? Can
you have both? Evidence suggests that the combination is fairly common and
that overlapping areas of the brain are involved in both disorders, but the
exact relationship between the two disorders still isn’t clear in the scientific
research.
Not all individuals with bipolar disorder have problems paying attention. Some
people can focus quite well when hording baseball cards, memorizing trivia,
and convincing you that they’re right and you’re wrong. But many people with
bipolar disorder do seem to have trouble with executive function — the ability
to organize, sort, and manage incoming information and make decisions. ADHD
often includes executive-function problems as well. The brain’s CEO may be
compromised in both disorders, and that may explain why the conditions seem
to overlap so frequently.
The depressed child or adolescent
Child-and-adolescent depression is a condition that tragically results in one
of the leading causes of death in teenagers: suicide. But depression can be
283
Chapter 18: Backing Your Bipolar Child

tricky to spot, particularly in teens who already seem moody and impulsive.
Depression in kids and teens doesn’t always look like it does in adults;
depressed kids can appear angry, bored, or withdrawn rather than sad and
dejected. Parents often think that a kid doesn’t have depression if he can
still smile or have fun: “He can have fun with his friends, so how can he be
depressed?” Kids, like adults, try to keep functioning in public for as long as
they can to avoid being noticed and to keep from being embarrassed in front
of their peers. And like adults, when a teen feels depressed, he tries to do
something to make himself feel better, and being with friends may be the
only activity in his life that feels remotely positive. School and home, with
the demands and judgments, are painful. Friends are comforting.
How can you decide whether your child or teenager is being “dramatic” or is
sinking into a serious depression? Look for the following signs:
 Persistent changes in function: Everybody has good and bad days or
weeks. Inconsistency is a hallmark of humanity, but when your child or
adolescent begins to experience extended periods of time when he’s
“not himself,” you need to pay attention. Changes in grades, friends,
activities, energy, and enthusiasm that go on for more than a couple of
weeks are worth looking into.
 Any self-harm or talk of suicide: These are big red flags that you must
respond to immediately. Even if you think your child just wants attention
or wants to manipulate you, the fact that he’s using suicide or self-injury
as his tool is already a problem. A child with adequately developing mood
and behavioral coping mechanisms doesn’t typically use this method to
communicate a need for attention or to manipulate his environment.
Always take threats of suicide seriously. Don’t try to determine yourself
if your child really means it. Get a professional opinion immediately.
 Withdrawal: Kids like their personal space, and adolescents particularly
spend plenty of time in their rooms. But kids who hardly leave their
rooms, stop spending time with friends, or start dropping their after-
school and weekend activities are showing signs of depression. This
behavior can happen gradually and may be hard to notice.
 Sleep/energy changes: Kids change sleep patterns throughout their
development. As teenagers, we seem to develop a need to stay up late
and sleep later into the day. The trend is fairly universal; however, a kid
who changes his patterns and starts sleeping a lot more or a lot less than
usual may be depressed. If your child’s energy levels seem to be dropping
and not rebounding after a couple of weeks, schedule a medical exam. If
the doctor finds no medical cause, depression may be a possibility.
 Substance use: Drinking and marijuana use seem to be ubiquitous in
high schools nowadays. Keeping kids from these experiences is a diffi-
cult challenge, but a kid who uses substances regularly or significantly
increases his use may be self-medicating. Don’t convince yourself that
“all kids do it.” If your kid gets high or drunk every weekend, you need
to look into it. Depression is closely related to substance abuse.
284
Part V: Assisting a Friend or Relative with Bipolar Disorder 

If depression is part of the diagnostic picture in a child or adolescent, you auto-
matically raise a red flag for bipolar disorder. People who develop depression
early in life are more likely to develop bipolar disorder than someone who
develops depression at a later age. Not every kid who suffers from depression
eventually receives a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, but your child’s doctor may
look a little closer for any warning signs, including some of the following:
 Repeated depressions: A child or teen who experiences numerous
episodes of depression is a more likely candidate for a bipolar diagnosis
eventually. If the episodes are brief (three months or less), the risk
increases.
 Family history of mania/bipolar disorder: The risk of developing bipo-
lar disorder is higher if you have a first-degree relative with the illness
(a parent or sibling). If you have identical twins, and one twin develops
bipolar disorder, the other one has an 80 percent chance of developing
the disorder, too.
 Manic or hypomanic response to antidepressants: A manic response is
a suggestive symptom, but it isn’t diagnostic of bipolar disorder. People
can become manic or agitated on antidepressants without having bipo-
lar disorder.
 Lack of response to antidepressants: Difficult, severe depressions that
don’t respond to antidepressants are associated with a bipolar pattern.
 Drop-off in response to antidepressants: People who respond to anti-
depressants temporarily (even after dose increases and medication
changes) are more apt to receive a bipolar diagnosis.
 A “larger than life” temperament: People with baseline hyperthymic
personalities are considered a high bipolar risk. Hyperthymic is a med-
ical term for “high energy” — very outgoing and active, often highly con-
fident, sometimes seen as arrogant or narcissistic.
These factors aren’t diagnostic for bipolar disorder; just count them as big
red flags. This realization is important, because treating bipolar disorder with
antidepressants alone can be risky — it can trigger mania or agitation. If your
child’s doctor identifies a number of these warning signs, she may choose dif-
ferent medications than she would for a kid without these characteristics.
Bipolar disorder often requires at least two medications: one to treat mania
and the other for depression (see Chapter 7 for more information). If bipolar
disorder is unlikely, the medication choices are often, but not always, clearer
and less dangerous, which is why a full history and extended interview are
such important parts of treating a child or adolescent with depression.
The oppositional kid
The term “oppositional kid” may seem redundant to most parents and teach-
ers. Every child is oppositional at times. The attitude is part of growing up.
285
Chapter 18: Backing Your Bipolar Child

By the time a child reaches the terrible twos, he’s mastered the word “no”
and uses it quite appropriately to mark his parents’ limits. Adolescence is
another time of life characterized by oppositional behaviors — teenagers
want to do things their way, not their parents’ way.
For most kids, these behaviors respond fairly well to the usual carrot-and-
stick parenting techniques, but oppositional kids exhibit a much more tena-
cious defiance. Their entire lives seem to revolve around the word “no.”
Either the kid constantly says “no” or hears “no.” Parents describe the child
as “stubborn,” “strong willed,” or simply “a pain in the neck.” When this pat-
tern creates significant problems in function — at school, at home, with
friends, or during activities — a doctor or therapist may suggest a diagnosis
of ODD (Oppositional Defiant Disorder). The problem with this diagnosis is
that oppositional behavior, like anger, is a symptom shared among a host of
diagnoses and conditions, resulting in what professionals technically refer to
as a “real muddle.” So even if the ODD diagnosis fits, you want to know what
else is going on. Here are some possible explanations:
 Mood disorders (depression or bipolar): Mood conditions can create
a pattern of defiance. A kid whose mood, rather than logical thinking,
drives his brain has less mental muscle to do what he has to do in life.
Depression saps energy and interest, and mania clouds judgment and
inhibition.
 Temperament: Kids start out in the world loaded with certain basic ten-
dencies. The ability to “go with the flow,” as opposed to sticking with an
agenda, is called cognitive flexibility. Some people (kids included) are
more naturally inflexible and have a harder time negotiating the demands
of life. Beyond a child’s natural tendencies, mismatches of temperament
between a child and the adults in his life (parents and teachers) can exac-
erbate or even trigger significant oppositional behavioral patterns.
 Anxiety: Anxiety, like a mood problem, takes over the brain and gets in
the way of good decision-making. The only thing an anxious person can
concentrate on is reducing his anxiety, so telling him that he has to do
his homework may not register if he can’t stop worrying that a robber is
in the house and wants to kill him.
 ADHD: Kids with less impulse control can’t follow directions as well or
limit negative behaviors as effectively as other kids. Kids who can’t pay
attention often don’t hear the directions the first few times.
 PDDs (Pervasive Developmental Disorders): These include diagnoses
such as Asperger’s disorder and high-functioning autism. Kids in this
category are, by definition, cognitively rigid and tend to perseverate, or
get stuck on certain activities that interest them. They have a particu-
larly hard time moving through commands and instructions on a day-to-
day basis. Although more severe forms are obvious in their diagnoses,
doctors sometimes miss the subtle forms.
286
Part V: Assisting a Friend or Relative with Bipolar Disorder 

 Learning and language disabilities: Anything that gets in the way of
a kid’s ability to correctly take in, process, and produce responses to
information from the world can create oppositional and defiant behavior
patterns.
An oppositional kid can easily get labeled as a “problem child,” resulting in
more frequent negative interactions with adults in his world. The potential
for a chronically angry and explosive kid with problems at school and home
is enormous, and a diagnosis of bipolar disorder often gets thrown into the
mix. Before making any diagnostic decision, you and your child’s doctor
should consider all the possible causes for your child’s pattern of behavior.
When dealing with an oppositional child, open your mind to other possible
reasons why he may be acting defiant. Don’t just look at what you or others
may have done to spoil the child or make him manipulative or “bratty.”
Although your assessment may be that you need to work on your skills as a
disciplinarian, try looking at your child’s temperament and other possible
contributions to this pattern that make it hard for him to choose more coop-
erative behaviors. He may not want to drive you crazy; he may just be stuck
in a pattern. A more positive, flexible approach on your part can neutralize
some of the power struggles and reduce some of the defiance and conflict,
thereby reducing the likelihood of escalating explosions and mood reactions.
In other words, sometimes you may need to back off on the less important
issues. The Explosive Child, 2nd Edition, by Ross Greene (HarperCollins), is
an excellent reference that provides plenty of detailed suggestions.
The law-breaking kid
If your child or teenager has run-ins with the law, you should strongly con-
sider screening for psychiatric disorders. Mood disorders, particularly
mania, are much more common in kids who commit crimes. In many cases,
substance abuse buddies up with a psychiatric illness, creating a dangerous
duo that lead your child to trouble’s door. Alternative schools and detention
centers are populated with an inordinate percentage of adolescents who
suffer from bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, or ADHD.
Legal problems are usually the result of multiple factors, but evaluating for a
psychiatric disorder and treating the disorder effectively can make a big dif-
ference for some kids. The courts are overburdened and unlikely to recom-
mend evaluations for many cases. Parents and mental health professionals
need to advocate for these psychiatric workups and treatments when their
children are heading down this path. Don’t assume that the system will do
what’s best for your child.
287
Chapter 18: Backing Your Bipolar Child

Requesting a Professional Evaluation
Maybe after reading the previous ten pages, the only conclusion you can
draw is that your child has some characteristics that may be caused by one
of a dozen different things, including your parenting skills and your relation-
ship with your spouse. Now what? Now you get your child to a professional
who can help you sort out the possible causes and pinpoint one or two that
can steer you toward obtaining proper treatment.
How can I find the right doctor?
A good starting point is your family doctor or pediatrician. Pediatricians are
becoming increasingly familiar with psychiatric diagnoses in kids and can
guide you and your child to the appropriate psychiatric help. Also, the pedia-
trician can conduct a full medical examination to rule out the presence of any
health issues that could be contributing to your child’s problems. Conditions
such as thyroid disease and some anemias can generate mood symptoms.
The doctor can also address general health issues such as sleep and growth,
which may be important factors in a mood disorder.
After a physician rules other illnesses out, if you still have serious concerns
about mood disorders, the next step is to consult a board-certified child-and-
adolescent psychiatrist. Some adult psychiatrists work with adolescents and
may be comfortable diagnosing and treating kids over 16. Younger teens and
children, however, should see a psychiatrist trained and experienced in work-
ing with kids’ brains.
Beware of doctors who proceed with a “diagnosis by prescription.” The
doctor spends 15 minutes with you and your child; hands you a prescription
for Ritalin or an antidepressant; and then, when your kid ends up in the hos-
pital, he tries a different medication to see if it will work. A thorough evalua-
tion takes time, input from various sources, and detective work. Is there a
child-and-adolescent psychiatrist in the house?
Finding a child-and-adolescent psychiatrist may take some work, depending
on where you live. This field has a shortage of qualified professionals, partic-
ularly in some areas of the country. Even if you can locate a number of child
doctors in your area, finding one who fits into your insurance plan can be a
nightmare. Look to the following sources for leads:
 Your child’s pediatrician
 The school system’s special education department
 Friends or relatives
 A counselor or therapist who works with your child

Chapters 5 and 6 describe the process of finding and choosing a psychiatrist
and assembling a mood-management team and support network. This infor-
mation is valuable for putting together a team for your child’s care as well.
If your child expresses suicidal thoughts or behaviors, run, don’t walk, to
your nearest mental health professional or emergency room. Don’t wait to
find someone through referrals or plans. You can do that later. Get help right
away, and sort through your long-term options later.
What else can I do at this stage?
As a parent and/or guardian, your role at this stage is to find a doctor you
think is best qualified to evaluate and treat your son or daughter and to pro-
vide that person with the most accurate and complete history you can possi-
bly present. Your child may be unable or unwilling to describe symptoms or
to relate the details of various incidents that can help the doctor accurately
assess the situation, so you need to supply that information without running
your child’s self-esteem through the grinder. The following suggestions come
from others who have been in the trenches:
 Be open and honest. If you and your spouse are having marital prob-
lems, or if one of you has a drinking or substance-abuse problem, don’t
keep it a secret. Family problems can have a significant impact on your
child’s moods and on the diagnosis. Don’t let your child be misdiag-
nosed because you want to protect a family secret. Family therapy may
be a necessary first step in treating your child.
 Mention any history of mental illness in the family. Genetics plays a
strong role in bipolar disorder. If your family has a history of bipolar 
289
Chapter 18: Backing Your Bipolar Child

disorder, schizophrenia, depression, or other mental illness, be sure to
mention it.
 Recollect the history. When did you and others first become concerned?
Record descriptions and details of any incidents that your child has been
involved in that raised concern. Concentrate on home, school, your
child’s friends, and activities outside the home. Include dates. Also be
sure to record periods of relative calm, when you have observed few prob-
lems. Keeping a mood chart and sleep log for one or two weeks before
your appointment can help (see Chapter 12 for copies of these logs).
 Gather input from others. Ask caregivers, teachers, youth ministers,
coaches, and others who deal with your child for their observations and
input. Some therapists and psychiatrists have standard forms for col-
lecting this data as part of their evaluation processes. Parents can have
a skewed vision of their child’s behavior, so additional input may help
form a more balanced report.
 Meet with the doctor personally. Everyone closely involved should get
a chance to meet with the doctor privately. Parents need to honestly
report their concerns without shaming the child, and the child needs to
be able to speak openly about his symptoms. Exactly how this plays out
depends on the patient’s age and temperament, but the doctor needs to
obtain information from both sources. Confidentiality weighs heavily in
this situation, especially with teenagers. The usual arrangement is that
a doctor won’t tell parents what the patient says unless a safety risk is
involved. Clarify the boundaries of confidentiality with your child’s
doctor from the start.
 Obtain a copy of the evaluation. In this day and age, people change
doctors more often than they change clothes. Having the evaluation and
any diagnoses in writing can smooth the transition to another doctor or
therapist.
If you don’t feel sure about the diagnosis or treatment plan or comfortable
with the answers to your questions, obtain a second opinion. Given the com-
plexity of the situation, a second viewpoint can be valuable in helping you
make the best decisions and treatment choices.
Breaking Out the Treatment Toolbox
With a diagnosis in hand and the assistance of your child’s doctor and sup-
port network, your family can prepare to embark on a course of treatment.
Your journey will meander along a path strewn with starts and stops, suc-
cesses and failures, fatigue, and financial drain, but it eventually leads to the
land of stabilization for your child and family. The journey may be rough, but
you have several tools at your disposal to help you reach your destination:
290
Part V: Assisting a Friend or Relative with Bipolar Disorder 

 Medications: Balancing and calming the overcooked nervous system usu-
ally requires at least some period of medication. Although you and your
doctor may have concerns about using medications in children and
teenagers, the right medication combination can ultimately be a lifesaver.
 Therapy: Individual therapy, family and parenting therapy, and group and
social-skills therapy are the building blocks of treating children with bipo-
lar disorder. Cognitive behavioral types of therapy are probably most
commonly used, but other techniques are certainly employed as well.
 School support and intervention: Kids spend much of their daily lives
in school, and mood disorders disrupt school life in many ways. Building
the right educational setting and support system, which we discuss in
the section “Tending to school matters,” later in this chapter, is as criti-
cal as any other intervention on the menu.
 Lifestyle/expectations management: Throughout this book, we discuss
the beneficial effects that lifestyle changes can have on the treatment
outcome. This discussion applies to children, too, but in the case of 
children, the parents must accept, implement, and encourage these
lifestyle changes so the child doesn’t feel pressured to fulfill unrealistic
expectations.
 Hospitalization: Hospitalization is a last resort, but it may be the only
option if your child may harm himself or others, such as siblings.
Managing the disorder without hospitalization is possible, but children
with bipolar disorder are commonly hospitalized at least once for the 
illness.
Cautiously treating the developing brain
The idea of treating a child with psychiatric medications may send shivers
down your spine. People often find it hard to imagine that children can hurt
so much emotionally that they need medication. “Kids should just be happy
and do what they’re told.” “If parents would give their kids a good spanking
when they needed it, the kids wouldn’t be such spoiled brats.” The idea that
bipolar disorder is a physical illness is hard enough to grasp when you see it
in adults; in kids, for some reason, people are even more unlikely to accept
this scientifically clear premise.
When a child’s mood problems are destroying her chances of safely making
the transition to adulthood, or the symptoms are disrupting her develop-
ment, medications are often the only viable solution. Despite all the diagnos-
tic challenges, when a child’s depression, mania, or rage hijacks her life,
chemical adjustments become necessary. Much like bipolar disorder itself,
the process of medicating a child is complicated.
291
Chapter 18: Backing Your Bipolar Child

Complicating factors for medication
The study of psychiatric medication in children is still in its infancy. Other
disorders, such as ADHD and anxiety disorder, have been studied in kids, but
scientists are just beginning to look closely at biological treatments for bipo-
lar disorder in kids — including depression, mania, and cycling. Chapter 7
describes in detail many of the medications used in treating bipolar disorder
in adults. Doctors also prescribe most of these medications for children,
using the adult research and what little information is out there about kids
with the disorder. For many reasons, doctors must be especially careful with
children and teenagers. Here are some of the difficulties:
 Different brains, different reactions: Child and adolescent brains differ
from adult brains. Medications affect the wiring and structures in the
brain, and in kids, these elements are immature, so the medications may
work differently on bipolar symptoms in kids. The potential benefits and
side effects of medications aren’t as predictable in children as they are
in adults, based on current science, because the science comes from
studying adult brains.
 Changing brains, changing reactions: Not only do young brains differ
from those of adults, but they also change constantly. Treating a child’s
brain is like trying to hit a moving target. You may get things stabilized
just right and then puberty strikes or some physiological event occurs.
Now the brain sits in a new chemical environment, and the medication
combinations need adjusting.
 Murkier symptoms: Bipolar symptoms in children aren’t as clear-cut as
they are in adults. When a child tantrums and rages, you must ask: Is she
depressed, anxious, manic, or sleep deprived? The answers determine
the choice of treatment, and they can be very difficult to tease out.
 Lack of understanding/noncompliance: A child’s understanding of her
illness varies with her age and developmental stage. Including her in
conversations as much as possible in age-appropriate ways is important.
Over the course of kids’ lives, they’ll need to manage their moods and
behavioral symptoms, and now is the time to start. But given that many
of the symptoms of bipolar disorder include being oppositional and
explosive, convincing a kid to cooperate with treatment often makes or
breaks treatment plans. And just like adults, kids can feel flattened by
the medicine or dislike side effects such as weight gain or sedation.
 Parental conflict: Parents often disagree about the diagnosis of bipolar
disorder and the necessity of medication in kids. Media images of psy-
chiatric medication and the stigma associated with mental illness can
weigh heavily on parents’ minds as they make difficult choices. If a
parent has bipolar disorder, her personal experiences may color the
decisions about treating her child. And if parents don’t see eye to eye,
the child often gets caught in the middle.
292
Part V: Assisting a Friend or Relative with Bipolar Disorder 

What do you do then, sitting in the psychiatrist’s office, trying to make the
best decision for your child? How can you decide which way to go? Your best
bet is to gather as much information as you can before making a decision.
Questions to ask and consider with the doc
Here are some things to consider or review with your child’s doctor before
you make medication decisions:
 How did you make this diagnosis? You want to know your doctor’s
thought process, not just a pronouncement. Given the complexity of a
bipolar diagnosis in kids, don’t just accept it without a careful review of
how the doctor arrived at her conclusion. You can think more critically
and carefully about your child’s condition with this information.
 How did you choose this particular medication? Just like making a
diagnosis, choosing a medication is a layered process with many pieces
to it. You want to know your doctor’s thought process so that you can
understand it and then evaluate her recommendations. If the doctor
hands you a prescription with no explanation, find another doctor.
 Have there been studies in children with this medication? Find out if
the medication has been studied in kids and how often it has been used
for children. Ask if the medication has an FDA indication, which means
that the Food and Drug Administration approves the medication for this
particular use in kids. Many psychiatric medications don’t have FDA
indications in children — they’re used off label. This practice is com-
pletely legal, very common, and often the right choice, but you want to
know what information is out there.
 What are the target symptoms? What are the goals of this particular
medication, and how can you measure if it’s working or not? Keeping
mood charts, rage counts, and sleep journals are some ways that you
and your doctor can follow your child’s progress (see Chapter 12).
Otherwise, sorting out the response can be quite difficult, because all
the tantrums melt together in your head after a while.
 What are the side effects? What side effects should you look for, and
how can you measure them? Do you need to watch for any dangerous
side effects? If you’re concerned about a side effect, how can you get in
touch with the doctor? Will she return your calls?
 How often will you see my child? How closely does the doctor need to
monitor your child on this medication? How long are the meetings? How
often will the doctor talk to you, the caregiver? Do you need to follow up
with laboratory tests or medical exams?
 How long will my child be on this medication? If your child does well
on a medication, how long will she need to stay on it? If she doesn’t do
well, how long should your child stay on this medicine before moving on
to another? What are the criteria for stopping or changing a medicine?
How will the doctor make that decision?
293
Chapter 18: Backing Your Bipolar Child

Getting the right medication combination can take a while. Avoid the
temptation to throw in the towel and give it all up when nothing seems
to work. Persistence pays off.
 Will you talk to other caregivers? Will the doctor communicate with
your child’s therapist? Pediatrician? Neurologist? Teacher? Can you
expect the doctor to give you a written report? Does this cost more?
Bring a written list of questions with you and a pad of paper to write down
the answers. During these meetings, you and your doctor exchange a lot of
information in a short period of time — you won’t remember it all.
Parenting a child with bipolar disorder
Parenting is quite a challenge even when kids have the standard amount of
control over their thoughts and emotions, but parenting children with bipolar
disorder poses greater challenges. Sure, the medication can help stabilize the
neurons and chemistry in your child’s brain, but the chaos of everyday life
outside the brain — bedtime, the morning rush, sibling rivalries, family dis-
cord, and other commotion — requires intensive care as well. Many of the
therapeutic approaches we discuss in Chapter 8 work effectively for both
adults and children, but with children, the approach usually requires a
slightly higher dose of family therapy.
Some standard parenting approaches aren’t only ineffective, but also aggra-
vate your child’s condition; negatively affect her self-esteem; and make you
feel powerless, guilty, and resentful toward your child. To survive as a parent
and avoid the everybody-loses confrontations, keep the following sugges-
tions in mind:
 Don’t take your child’s behavior personally. You’re not a bad parent
just because you can’t control your child’s behavior.
 Don’t blame your child for negative behaviors. Remember that bipolar
disorder significantly impairs a person’s self-control. Most negative
behaviors grow out of your child’s distress, not a desire to break the
rules or anger you. This doesn’t mean that you should abandon limits
and consequences, but staying calm and picking your battles buys you
some peace of mind.
 Avoid shaming your child or using highly punitive discipline. These tac-
tics only make matters worse. If your child can’t meet the demands you
place on her because of her mood instability, anxiety, or low energy, for
example, consequences won’t change her inability to meet your expecta-
tions, so you and your child end up feeling more hopeless and angry.
 Do what you can to help your child accept herself as she is and to inte-
grate the disorder into her life. Acceptance and integration are the pri-
mary goals of therapy, and as a parent, you can help tremendously. Like
294
Part V: Assisting a Friend or Relative with Bipolar Disorder 

adults, children must work toward understanding that they aren’t bipo-
lar, but have bipolar disorder. It doesn’t define them, although it’s a big
part of their lives. Their frustrations will be numerous.
 Allow your child and yourself to grieve. Your child grieves over the dif-
ferences between herself and her peers. As a parent, you grieve the loss
of the child you expected and some of the dreams you may have had for
her. Everyone must move forward. A skilled therapist can guide you and
your child through this long and arduous process.
Parenting a child with such unique emotional and behavioral needs requires
specialized skills. The therapist and your psychiatrist can provide you with
strategies and techniques for managing everything from the biggest crisis to
mundane matters such as getting your child out of bed in the morning.

Sam’s journey
Sam was adopted at birth. He was full of life,
affectionate, loving . . . and challenging. Early on
in his childhood, he struggled with severe sep-
aration anxiety and would rage whenever his
parents left the house. Going to school led to a
daily meltdown, even into fifth grade. At that
point, the rages increased in frequency, taking
over the family life. Sam began to exhibit
depression, expressing hopelessness and
despair when he wasn’t raging and breaking
things. At the age of 12, he threatened to kill
himself.
After several evaluations, he was diagnosed
with bipolar disorder and comorbid anxiety.
Medication trials took months and continued for
years. Antidepressants and antianxiety medi-
cines were essential, but they often agitated
him. Lithium was effective, but he couldn’t tol-
erate the weight gain. Periods of stability
occurred for months at a time, but then a life
change or developmental problem (girlfriends,
school failure, and medication side effects,
including his inability to concentrate) would
demand medication adjustments. When he hit
his junior year in high school, he stopped taking
some of his medications because of the side
effects, and he relapsed into severe mood
cycles, requiring repeated hospitalizations. It
wasn’t clear if he would even receive credit for
the school year.
Sam’s family felt exhausted and full of despair.
His younger sister became depressed and anx-
ious. Despite enormous financial pressures, his
mother put in for family leave from work to
manage the many medical visits and school
issues that were essential to Sam’s recovery
and to give the whole family some downtime.
Sam continues to recover from the junior-year
episode and has re-entered school. His school
is doing all it can to help him regain lost time and
credits. The doctor is still adjusting Sam’s med-
ications, but Sam is able to function. Sam and
his doctor are now communicating more effec-
tively regarding Sam’s concerns about side
effects so he doesn’t take matters into his own
hands again. The process of recovery and man-
agement continues, and everyone involved
becomes more hopeful with each passing day.

Judgment, criticism, and demands may seem to have a place in parenting, but
finding other, more positive ways to communicate with your child is far more
successful, particularly in a child with bipolar disorder.
Tending to school matters
Kids with bipolar disorder are sensitive and reactive. They have less buffer
than most kids and can be extremely reactive to teacher temperament,
schedules, peer conflict, and unanticipated change. Oppositional behavior,
meltdowns, and social drama dot the landscape of school for a child with
bipolar disorder. Teachers and administrators can develop negative attitudes
and expectations for your child, which only makes success more difficult.
How can you minimize the damaging impact of bipolar disorder on school? Is
it possible that school can be part of the process of recovery and prevention?
Taking advantage of available services
Just like all kids, a child with mental health issues needs and is entitled to an
appropriate education. Other kids with special needs, such as physical chal-
lenges and language differences, are entitled to appropriate modifications in
the educational setting. Children with bipolar disorder are just as deserving
of appropriate services that enable them to participate in the educational
process — services mandated by law. Your options include the following:
 Special Education Services: The Individuals with Disabilities in Education
Act, or IDEA, which Congress updated in 1997, requires that schools pro-
vide these services under certain conditions:
• To obtain services, you must request, in writing, that your child
be evaluated for special education services. Usually, this request
goes to the director of special education in your school district.
• The school district has a designated time frame to respond to your
request. Schools typically have 30 days to respond — 30 school
days, not 30 calendar days.
• The evaluation includes a minimum of three types of assessments:
psychological, educational, and social. School or district psycholo-
gists and social workers usually conduct these evaluations.
• An IEP team considers your child’s case. After the evaluations are
completed, an IEP (Individualized Educational Plan) team holds a
meeting to determine if your child meets the criteria for services.
• The team must include you, your child’s teacher, a district spe-
cial education representative, and a special education teacher.
States often require that a parent advocate (often another parent
from the district) be on the team.
296
Part V: Assisting a Friend or Relative with Bipolar Disorder 

• The team develops an IEP. If your child is eligible to receive ser-
vices, the team develops an IEP to outline where and how the
school will educate your child, based on her needs.
• You must agree with and sign off on the IEP for it to proceed.
This ensures that you have the final say in the IEP.
 Section 504 Services: Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and
the Americans with Disabilities Act proscribe laws to provide for modifi-
cations to the educational program that allow your child to participate
without being discriminated against for a disability:
• Section 504 plans typically address less-severe needs than spe-
cial education services. You may have more success convincing
your child’s school to provide special services under Section 504
than under the IDEA.
• Section 504 services are defined locally. Procedures for obtaining
these services vary from district to district.
• The evaluation process varies. In some cases, the school may need
to evaluate your child; in other cases, you simply need to produce a
letter or report from your child’s doctor.
• Modifications are based on your child’s unique needs.
Modifications can include providing extended time on testing, 
separate testing locations, oral rather than written tests, and 
computer use in class, to name a few.
Now you’ve taken the necessary steps to get your child the proper education.
However, your child isn’t the only one who needs a lesson.
Educating the educators about bipolar disorder
The process of obtaining an appropriate education for your child is often
daunting. Schools are inundated with demands for services, and budgets are
stretched thin. The educational community has a track record of inconsistent
understanding and awareness of mental health needs in kids. Stigma and a
lack of understanding about bipolar disorder are rampant everywhere, includ-
ing in schools. During the process, you can expect to educate the educators.
Advocacy is your mission. Keep the following in mind as you proceed:
 Communication is key: Begin by talking and staying in touch with your
child’s teachers to get their takes on your child’s needs. Get to know the
guidance counselor or social worker who’s involved. Ongoing communi-
cation provides you with information and demonstrates your concern
and involvement — important tools in your ongoing negotiations with
the school and the district.
 Gather supporting data: Get reports from your psychiatrist and thera-
pist. Bring them to meetings. Encourage phone or e-mail communication
between the school and your medical team.
297
Chapter 18: Backing Your Bipolar Child

 Know your rights: Federal education law mandates that every state
maintain parent resource and training centers that provide guidance and
information for parents as they navigate the special education system.
The centers are sometimes referred to as advocacy centers. Your state
department of education or your special education department should
be able to give you a list of these places.
 Network with other parents: Special education PTAs or more informal
gatherings of parents who are in your child’s school system can provide
a wealth of information, as well as camaraderie and support.
Practicing lifestyle management
Lifestyle changes can enhance the management of bipolar disorder and often
alleviate symptoms. Many of the suggestions we offer here and throughout
this book apply to children with bipolar disorder as well:
 Ensure proper health and nutrition — see Chapter 14.
 Adjust expectations and develop more structured schedules and rou-
tines — see Chapter 13.
 Pace your family life and your child’s activities — see Chapter 11.
 Map and track moods — see Chapter 12.
All these strategies and techniques can contribute to your child’s treatment
success. Battling with your kids over things like food and exercise may not
always be advisable — if you create rages or meltdowns, for example — but
over time, working to establish some healthy lifestyle habits eventually pays
dividends.
Keep track of your expectations and demands for your child. Letting go of
your expectations and embracing the child you have, not the child you
expected, empowers and liberates you and your child. Grieving the loss of
that “expected child” is important work, but a healthy grieving process even-
tually helps you let go. Until that work is done, you can’t move forward.
Turning to hospitalization 
for suicide prevention
Bipolar disorder is a potentially lethal disease. People with this disorder
often kill themselves. Suicide is a leading cause of death in adolescents, and
bipolar disorder increases this risk significantly. To prevent suicide, keep the
following guidelines in mind:
298
Part V: Assisting a Friend or Relative with Bipolar Disorder 

 Never ignore threats of suicide or self-harm. Don’t try to determine if
your child “really means it.” Let an expert evaluate your child to assess
the risk.
 Pay attention to substance abuse. Alcohol intoxication dramatically
increases the risk of completed suicide.
 Watch for covert signs. Maybe you notice your child organizing and
giving away belongings (preparing for “when I’m gone”), experiencing
sudden and extreme changes in activity levels or socialization, or talking
of despair and hopelessness or death, even if you don’t hear her speak
of suicide in particular.
 If you have concerns, don’t be afraid to talk about them. Bringing
up suicide won’t give your child the idea; you don’t create suicidal
thoughts by talking about it. Not talking about your worries is much
more dangerous.
If your child appears suicidal or out of control, your doctor may recommend
hospitalization. Psychiatric hospitalization is only for brief periods of time
(often fewer than ten days) and is only for safety and crisis management.
Hospitals don’t do extended evaluations anymore, because insurance doesn’t
cover it. When considering hospitalization:
 Talk to your doctor about where he admits people or if he uses a hospi-
tal where another doctor does the inpatient treatment (this varies
regionally).
 Review hospital choices with your insurance company, because it may
contract only with certain hospitals.
 Expect a long day during admission, and expect to spend as much time
at the hospital as you can during your child’s stay. Being a presence,
even when your child says she doesn’t want to see you, is critical for
getting good care and for your child’s well-being.
 Ask the hospital staff about the hospital’s policies regarding seclusion
and restraint and prn meds — meds given if a child is out of control.
Make sure the staff informs you if either of these measures is necessary.
Make sure they know you’re watching.
In some cases, children can’t stabilize at home and may require long-term
care at a residential facility. This process is beyond the scope of this chapter,
but you can obtain additional information from your doctor, your child’s
school system, or the Child and Adolescent Bipolar Foundation Web site
(www.bpkids.org). This site offers an array of information and support for
families dealing with a child who has bipolar disorder.

Ten Questions to Ask a
Psychiatrist or Therapist
In This Chapter
 Evaluating the professionals who evaluate you
 Contacting your caregivers in an emergency
 Identifying the signs that you’re getting better
 Knowing what to do if you start feeling worse
W
hen your doctor or therapist starts asking you questions, you may
begin to wonder who’s serving whom. As a savvy consumer, you
should be prepared to ask questions in order to assess the caregiver’s cre-
dentials and qualifications, make informed treatment choices, determine how
you can tell if the treatment is working, and know what to do if you begin feel-
ing worse.
This chapter provides a list of ten questions you should ask a psychiatrist or
therapist in order to obtain the information you need. Of course, you may
have additional questions, so be sure to write them down so you remember
to ask.
How Much Experience Do You Have
in Treating Bipolar Disorder?
Some psychiatrists and therapists are like general practitioners, and others
specialize in particular areas, such as bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety
disorders, or schizophrenia. Professionals who have more experience in
treating bipolar disorder are typically more apt to spot symptoms and warn-
ing signs and are more aware of what you may be experiencing and the types

of treatments that have worked for other clients. More specific questions
include the following:
 Are you licensed/certified?
Your psychiatrist should be board certified in psychiatry. Therapists typi-
cally are licensed, using a title such as LCSW (Licensed Clinical Social
Worker), or they have a degree, such as CSW (Clinical Social Worker) or
MSW (Masters in Social Work). Counselors may be licensed in some states.
 What are your specialties?
 Approximately how many people with bipolar disorder have you treated?
For links to state licensing boards for counselors and psychologists, visit
www.m-a-h.net/hip/stateboards.htm. To check on psychiatrists, go to
the American Medical Association Web site at www.ama-assn.org. This site
enables you to check the credentials of almost every licensed physician in
the United States.
Is It Tough to Get an Appointment?
If you can’t get in to see your doctor or therapist when your moods begin
to cycle, he can’t help you much, so before you choose a psychiatrist or 
therapist, make sure you won’t have to wait three months before your next
appointment.
When you begin treatment, you quickly discover the tricks and techniques
for getting appointments:
 Schedule at least three appointments in advance at regular intervals.
After each appointment, schedule another appointment so you always
have three scheduled.
 If you anticipate having difficulties scheduling appointments during a
particular season, set up appointments in advance. Most mental health-
care providers get very busy around Thanksgiving and Christmas.
 If you set up several appointments in advance and realize that you don’t
need a particular appointment, cancel it 24 to 48 hours in advance. (Find
out how far in advance you need to cancel or reschedule an appoint-
ment before the clinic charges you for it.)
 If you need to see your doctor or therapist, and the schedule is booked
solid, ask to be notified if another client cancels an appointment. Provide
all your contact numbers: home, cell phone, and work.
304
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Can I Contact You During a Crisis?
Nights, weekends, and holidays. The three times you most need your doctor
or therapist, she’s at home, spending time with her friends and family. The
nerve of these medical people! Everybody, even doctors and therapists,
needs some time off, but as a person with bipolar disorder, you need some
numbers to call in a crisis:
 Office number
 Cell phone or home number
 Name and number of the person who covers for your doctor or therapist
when she’s out of town
 Emergency number of the hospital or mental health center where you
should go in a crisis
Ask how long it typically takes your doctor or therapist to return calls if you
need to leave a message. (See Chapter 17 for more information on how to
plan ahead for a crisis.)
What’s the Diagnosis, and 
How Did You Arrive at It?
Most people who have bipolar disorder first report symptoms when they’re
depressed, so unless your doctor sees you during a hypomanic or manic
episode, he’s likely to make a diagnosis of depression and prescribe antide-
pressants, which could induce mania. Your evaluation, therefore, should
screen for a family history or any past symptoms of elevated mood. Make
sure your doctor considers the following:
 Family history of mood disorders, particularly bipolar disorder, suicide,
or eccentric behaviors, that may not have been diagnosed
 Family history of schizophrenia, which was often mistakenly diagnosed
in cases of bipolar disorder in the past
 Prior history of elevated moods. (Your doctor may have you fill out a
mania scale or ask questions about previous periods in which you felt
much more alert, productive, and inspired)
 Medical conditions that could possibly cause symptoms similar to bipo-
lar disorder. (Your psychiatrist may ask you if you’ve seen your family
physician)
Chapter 4 covers the many ways to arrive at an accurate diagnosis.
305
Chapter 19: Ten Questions to Ask a Psychiatrist or Therapist

What’s the Treatment Plan?
Your doctor may hand you one or more prescriptions for antidepressants,
mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, or sedatives, but your medication doesn’t
make up your complete treatment plan. A treatment plan should include a
combination of medication, therapy, lifestyle changes, and peer support. In
most cases, you should have a doctor and a therapist; ideally, they work
together to develop a treatment plan specifically for you. In practice, the
doctor typically handles the medications, and the therapist deals with every-
thing else. Your treatment plan should include the following:
 Medications
 Individual therapy
 Family education and, possibly, family therapy
 Instructions on what to do if your moods begin to cycle
Want more info about treatment plans? Flip to Chapter 5.
When Can I Expect to See Improvement?
Your doctor and therapist often tell you to remain patient, and we do too,
but you should know up front what “patient” means. A week? A month? Two
months? In most cases, you can expect to see some improvement in one to
two weeks, but ask your doctor and therapist to be sure.
Typically, your doctor follows up with you in two to four weeks to assess the
effectiveness of the treatment and monitor for side effects. If the doctor tells
you to come back in more than one month after you start a new medicine,
find out why he doesn’t want to follow your situation more closely.
How Will I Know When My 
Condition Is Improving?
With bipolar disorder, feeling better may convince you that you are better,
particularly if you’re cycling into mania. Ask you doctor for more objective
signs that your mental health is improving.
306
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

When recovering from an episode of depression, signs of recovery may include
the following:
 Sleeping less (or sleeping more, if depression interfered with your sleep)
 Doing more with less effort
 Socializing more
 Crying less
 Diminished thoughts of death or suicide
When recovering from an episode of mania, signs of recovery may include the
following:
 Sleeping more, with less restless sleep
 Fewer and less-intense confrontations with others
 Improved ability to control impulses
 Less irritability
What Should I Do If I Feel Worse?
Although your doctor may be able to predict with some degree of certainty
the way you’ll respond to a medication based on her experience with other
patients, she can’t know for sure. Some medications may not work for you or
may have an adverse effect on you. If your condition fails to improve or wors-
ens, or if you have a bad reaction to the medication (such as a rash or short-
ness of breath), you should contact your doctor, who may suggest one or
more of the following steps:
 Stop taking the medication.
 Keep taking the medication to see if the side effect settles down or the
desired effects kick in, and call or come in to the office in a few days.
 Take a lower dose of the medication.
 Take a higher dose of the medication.
 Add something else to the medication.
307
Chapter 19: Ten Questions to Ask a Psychiatrist or Therapist

What Side Effects Should I Watch For?
Most doctors hand you a prescription for the medication(s) that she thinks is
going to be most effective and have the least chance of causing serious side
effects. If you want to be involved in the decision, pipe up before your doctor
reaches for the prescription pad. For every medication prescribed, you
should obtain answers to two questions:
 How effective is the medication at treating the symptoms I have? Are
there more effective medications?
 What are the potential risks and side effects of this medication, and
what are the chances that I’ll experience them? Are there any medica-
tions that have fewer, less-serious side effects?
You should always know the side effects of a medication before you begin
taking it so you know what to watch out for. After you have a list of the most
common and most serious potential side effects, ask what you should do if
you notice any signs of one of these side effects. For a complete tour of the
bipolar pharmacy, head to Chapter 7.
Will You Work Along with My
Other Treatment Providers?
Coordinated treatment, especially between your doctor and therapist, is an
essential component of success. Ask your doctor and therapist if they’re will-
ing to exchange notes, and make sure they have each other’s contact infor-
mation and signed consent forms that enable them to exchange information.
If you want family members, friends, and other nonprofessionals to enter the
treatment discussion, ask the doctors if they’re willing to talk with people in
your support network. Your doctor and therapist can’t legally discuss your
condition or treatment with anyone unless they have signed consent forms
from you. (To build your mood-management team, check out Chapter 6.)

Chapter 20
Ten Ways to Fight the High 
Cost of Treatment
In This Chapter
 Devising clever ways to get treatment without paying for it
 Helping yourself for free
 Finding cheap or free insurance for your child
 Pitching a payment plan to your psychiatrist or therapist
M
ental healthcare isn’t cheap. Even if you have health insurance, few
plans offer parity of coverage for mental illnesses; that is, the plans pro-
vide less coverage for mental illness than they do for other medical illnesses.
Mental health advocacy organizations are actively lobbying to have this
changed. In the meantime, you may be footing the major portion of your bills
for psychiatric care, leaving you to ask the question, “Can I afford to be sick?”
In this chapter, we help you answer that question by introducing various
ways you can avoid paying for mental healthcare and by tracking down
sources of financial assistance. Through self-help, community assistance pro-
grams, mental health agencies, and the flexibility of your psychiatrist and
other mental healthcare professionals, you may be able to create a custom
financial package that meets your needs.
Find a Community Mental Health Clinic
Many communities realize that not treating people with mental illnesses is
more costly than offering affordable treatment, and they invest in community-
based mental healthcare clinics. These clinics typically offer a wide range of
treatment options and assistance to people who qualify, and if you can’t
afford private treatment, you should qualify. Services typically include
 Psychiatric visits
 Therapy

 Payment plans
 Housing or assisted-living arrangements
 Job training and placement for people who can work
 Transportation
 Assistance securing Social Security and disability benefits
Consider contacting your local Mental Health Association for assistance. You
should be able to find the number for your state or county Mental Health
Association in your telephone directory or by contacting the National Mental
Health Association at 800-969-6642. If you have Internet access, you can search
a directory of Mental Health Associations online at www.nmha.org. The direc-
tory enables you to pull up a list of NMHA affiliates in any state. The NMHA
has over 340 affiliates.
Track Down a University Program
Because universities are often on the cutting edge of research, they can pro-
vide the latest treatment options and may even offer free treatment, especially
if you’re willing to take part in a study. If you do go through a university, try to
talk directly to a bipolar expert who’s in charge of the program. Some univer-
sity psychiatrists have several trainees studying under them, and if you get
shuttled from one trainee to another, you may find yourself constantly chang-
ing from one medication or treatment to another to your detriment. By recog-
nizing this risk, you can take steps to ensure continuity of treatment:
 Keep in touch with the supervising physician or psychiatrist. Make
sure she’s notified of any medication adjustments or other changes to
your treatment plan. Get a phone number — both her office number and
a number to call in emergencies.
 Request explanations for any changes to your medications or treatment.
Why is the trainee or doctor requesting the change? What are the desired
results? How long should it take before you see a positive change in your
condition? What are the possible side effects? And what should you do if
your condition worsens? See Chapter 19 for more questions to ask.
 Coordinate communication with all members of your treatment team.
If you have a therapist or doctor working with you outside of the univer-
sity, make sure the healthcare providers at the university keep him in
the loop.
Although becoming involved in a controlled study is an excellent way to
obtain access to the newest medications and to help the cause, ask addi-
tional questions of yourself and your care providers before you sign up.
Discover the possible risks of the new medication and how likely it is that
you’ll receive a placebo (a “sugar pill” with no medication in it). Make sure
310
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

your moods are stable enough to handle a change in medications, if that’s
what the study calls for. If you’re doing well on your current medication and
adjunctive treatments, we recommend that you stick with what’s working.
Find Peer Support
Everyone has something valuable and unique to teach you — whether it
involves a golf swing or a new therapy technique — and no one knows bipo-
lar disorder better than someone who’s living with it. 
Naturally, you may feel reluctant to sit in a room full of strangers and talk
about your life, but don’t write off peer support until you’ve tried it. It can
be a relief to be with people from whom you don’t have to hide the fact that
sometimes your brain short-circuits with unpredictable results. For details
on tracking down peer support groups in your area, turn to Chapter 6.
Contact Religious Organizations
Churches and other religious organizations often have qualified counselors
on staff who can provide therapy and other assistance for free. Many of these
services are offered free or at a reduced cost to church members, but even if
you’re not a member, you may find that the organization has an open door.
Religious organizations are always looking for new, dedicated members, and
offering help to the people who need it most is one of the best evangelistic
tools they have.
Be at least as careful when shopping for “free” counseling as you are when
shopping for private therapy. The quality of training varies widely, and many
religious organizations have their own agendas, which may not quite follow
proven treatment protocols. Avoid any organization that’s against the use of
psychiatric medications or requires you to make drastic changes to your life
that you aren’t completely comfortable making.
Obtain State Medical Assistance
Most states have a medical assistance office that can provide information
about available state and federally funded health insurance programs.
Starting your search at the local or state level is usually more efficient than
starting at the federal level, even though the latter may be where you eventu-
ally find the assistance you need. If you need help navigating the system, con-
tact your local Mental Health Association or community mental health clinic.
311
Chapter 20: Ten Ways to Fight the High Cost of Treatment

File for Disability and Medicaid
If you (or a loved one) are disabled by bipolar disorder or any of the other
medical illnesses associated with it, you may qualify for disability payments
and Medicare coverage. (Disability includes not being able to work for a
period of time until you find effective treatment.) You can find out more at
www.ssa.gov or by calling 800-772-1213. For more specific information, con-
tact your local Social Security office; details differ from state to state.
In Chapter 13, we provide a list of tips and tricks for winding your way
through the Social Security Administration to obtain disability benefits and
Medicaid. You need a good dose of patience and persistence to succeed.
And if at first you don’t succeed, call a good lawyer who specializes in Social
Security disability claims.
In some states, the only way to get Medicaid coverage for children with
mental illnesses is to surrender your parental rights to the state. These states
won’t cover such care unless the child has become a ward of the state’s child
protection agency. Advocacy groups are working with Congress to change
this, but it’s still the only option for parents in some parts of the country.
Find out everything you can about the laws in your state from mental health
advocacy organizations, and get help from an attorney or legal-aid organiza-
tion before signing any papers that take away your parental rights.
Check Out the “Insure 
Kids Now!” Program
If you can’t afford to insure a dependent child, the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services sponsors a program called “Insure Kids Now!” that helps
states provide low-cost or no-cost insurance to qualifying families. Call 800-
543-7669 or visit www.insurekidsnow.gov for more information.
Trying to obtain affordable healthcare for yourself or family members can be
incredibly frustrating, even for someone with a clear mind. If you’re ill, now is
the time to enlist the aid of a friend or family member to help with what is
often a very challenging process. For more information on building a good
support network, refer to Chapter 6. For emergency contact help, flip to
Chapter 17.
312
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Locate a Prescription Assistance Program
Individuals with mental illnesses often face the very real choice of paying for
food or medication. When you rely on medication to stabilize your moods
and give you a fighting chance at earning a living, that’s no choice at all.
Fortunately, several pharmaceutical companies, healthcare groups, and local
organizations offer prescription assistance programs that provide prescrip-
tion medications at no cost or at discount prices. In most cases, you need to
provide the following information to qualify:
 Your doctor’s written consent
 Proof that you have no health insurance or that your health insurance
doesn’t offer a prescription benefit or doesn’t cover the specific medica-
tion you need
 Proof that you qualify financially
To find out more about available prescription assistance programs, check out
the following sources:
 HelpingPatients.org at www.helpingpatients.org is a nonprofit organi-
zation that’s dedicated to helping low-income, uninsured patients find
free or affordable pharmaceuticals. At this site, you answer a few ques-
tions to gain access to programs for which you qualify and obtain the
paperwork you need to apply.
 Mental health advocacy organizations can help you track down programs
for which you qualify. See the section “Find a Community Mental Health
Clinic” earlier in this chapter.
 If you qualify for Medicare, go to www.medicare.gov/
AssistancePrograms to find out more about Medicare’s prescription
drug card and to see if you qualify for it.
 Pharmaceutical companies may offer their own prescription assistance
programs for people whose total family incomes are low. Your doctor or
pharmacist or sometimes your prescription label can tell you the manu-
facturer of your medication, and you can find contact information online
or in the phone book. In some cases, your doctor must contact the com-
pany on your behalf. 
 Search the Web for “prescription assistance program” to find links to
several other companies that provide information on prescription drug
cards, generic medications, and other cost-savings plans.
313
Chapter 20: Ten Ways to Fight the High Cost of Treatment

Your doctor may be able to provide an informal prescription assistance pro-
gram simply by supplying you with free samples. Many pharmaceutical com-
panies provide doctors with a good supply of samples.
Make a Deal with Your Psychiatrist
or Therapist
Some psychiatrists and therapists offer payment plans that allow their
patients to pay off their bills gradually. If you don’t have insurance, your psy-
chiatrist or therapist may offer you a discount. Many clinics and university
settings and some private practitioners offer a sliding scale, where the fee is
based on your ability to pay. You usually have to fill out some type of finan-
cial worksheet to determine if you qualify for reduced fees. Most large insur-
ance companies negotiate with providers in this way to save on costs, so
doctors and therapists commonly offer similar discounts to patients who
don’t have insurance. Always ask to be sure.
Help Yourself
If you go to a doctor for heart problems and want to have the best chance
of getting better, you’ll probably change your diet, exercise, and learn more
about heart health. You can do the same with bipolar disorder. Although you
can’t treat yourself, even if you’re a professional, you can discover ways to
cope with situations and symptoms that would’ve upended your life before
you got treatment. Your healthcare providers can help you learn real-world
coping skills and ways to avert crises.
The more that you and your family and friends can do to stabilize your
moods, the less that you need to rely on professionals to help. Completely
replacing professional care with self-help isn’t prudent, but investing time
and effort in becoming more knowledgeable about your illness and learning
ways to reduce stress can help you reduce your need for professional inter-
vention or hospitalization. By reading this book and following our sugges-
tions, you’re already well on your way to helping yourself.

Ten Ways to Help the
Bipolar Community
In This Chapter
 Spreading the word about bipolar disorder
 Joining a mental health advocacy group
 Contacting your government representatives
 Advocating for fair treatment and equal rights
W
hen you’re chin deep in a battle to reclaim your life, nobody expects
you to become an outspoken advocate for the bipolar community, but
when life settles down a bit and becomes more manageable, you may con-
sider contributing some time and effort (or funds) to the cause. After all, if
people who have a psychiatric illness and their loved ones don’t advocate for
fair treatment and equal rights, who will?
In this chapter, we offer several ways that you can become more involved in
spreading the word about mental health issues and working toward ensuring
fair treatment and equal rights for people who suffer from mental illnesses.
Begin Advocacy at Home
The battle against stigma is a grassroots war that begins in your immediate
and extended family. You can start winning the battle against ignorance by
educating family members. Those close to you may be a little gentler in their
criticism than the outside world, but criticism cuts deep, no matter what
form it takes.
If you notice that your family has little understanding of bipolar disorder or
other mental illnesses, you can educate them by describing the struggles
you’ve experienced and the lessons you’ve learned. You don’t need to become
confrontational — simply bringing up the issue and then offering to answer
any questions can get the conversation rolling.

Take the Battle to Your
Insurance Company
When it comes to mental health issues, many insurance companies are stuck
in the 1920s, when mental health issues were considered purely psychologi-
cal. They can’t admit that bipolar disorder and other mental illnesses are
physical in nature and that people who suffer from mental illnesses deserve
equitable care to establish and maintain their health. Advocates commonly
refer to equitable treatment as parity of benefits.
Although insurance companies insist that parity would be too expensive and
they would have to raise premiums, many public health studies show that
parity actually saves on medical costs in the long run. It just makes sense. By
successfully treating a person’s depression, you reduce the amount of time the
person must take off from work, which increases productivity and decreases
the incidents of related illnesses and risky behavior.
You can advocate for parity by becoming a more vigilant and active consumer:
 Compare co-payments for physicians and mental healthcare providers.
Does the insurance company require a higher co-pay for psychiatric and
therapy visits than for “doctor” visits? If so, that’s certainly unfair. Call
and complain. Write a letter to the company.
 Compare treatment benefits. Does the insurance company allow for
unlimited visits to other physicians but only a limited number for psy-
chiatric and therapy visits? Call your insurance company and ask why.
Write a letter.
 Compare lifetime benefits. Insurance companies commonly provide life-
time benefits for psychiatric disorders that amount to less than half the
benefits offered for treatments of other illnesses.
 Compare hospitalization benefits. Does the insurance company shell
out considerably less for psychiatric hospitalizations than it does for
standard hospitalizations? Many do. Check to make sure.
 If you have any say in selecting insurance providers, pick a company
that offers the highest parity of coverage. This enables you to vote with
your wallet.
 If your insurance company denies a claim for a visit to a psychiatrist
or therapist, contest the denial. Most insurance companies allow con-
sumers to contest denials. Find out when and how to submit your
protest. Go all the way to the top, and make plenty of noise.
316

Join an Advocacy Group
When you join an advocacy organization, you join millions of people working
for change. Most offer you a chance to meet people with similar life experi-
ences so you can empower one another through education, support, and a
common cause.
Get to know the advocacy organizations near you. Chances are you’ll find one
that fits your needs and connects you to people with whom you can relate. If
you aren’t ready to shout from the rooftops yet, a small donation goes a long
way to help a mental health advocacy organization spread the word. If you
don’t know whom to contact, start with the biggies:
 NAMI (National Alliance for the Mentally Ill): If you’re itching to help in
some way, but you’re not sure how, NAMI can offer dozens of ideas and
find a role for you in its organization. You can teach NAMI classes, head
a local support group, write letters to local and national politicians,
donate money, or contribute in many other ways. With NAMI, you can
become just as involved as you want to be. For more information, visit
NAMI’s Web site at www.nami.org, call 800-950-NAMI (6264), or call your
local NAMI chapter.
 DBSA (Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance): DBSA is best known
for its peer support groups, but it’s also heavily involved in advocacy. In
fact, the DBSA Web site at www.dbsalliance.org features an Advocacy
link you can click to access an entire electronic booklet on advocacy
that covers everything from defining it and explaining why it’s important
to how the legislative process works and how to contact your legisla-
tors. The booklet is an excellent how-to manual if you want to become
involved on the political level.
Get Involved in Local Support Groups
To become an effective advocate, you need to educate yourself, and one of
the best ways to learn is to get connected with other similarly interested
people locally. Local support groups are grassroots information kiosks where
people freely exchange information and advice about doctors, therapists,
medications, insurance companies, IEPs (Individualized Education Plans),
work-related issues, and legal issues.
In addition to providing you with valuable information, support groups put
you in touch with the people-power you need to promote any initiatives you
seek to enact at the community level. Your presence at support meetings
gives others the confidence and power to speak out as well.
317
Chapter 21: Ten Ways to Help the Bipolar Community

Teach Classes on Mental Health Issues
Local support groups and other organizations frequently offer classes on var-
ious mental health issues. As a person with bipolar disorder or a person who
has a loved one with bipolar disorder, you have valuable first-hand experi-
ences and insights to offer others, particularly in a classroom setting —
teaching a class, acting as a guest speaker, or simply joining in as a participat-
ing group member.
Many organizations offer training programs and services for consumers, family
members, providers, and the general public, including NAMI’s Family to Family
and C.A.R.E. programs and numerous others (see www.peersupport.org/
PeerTrng.htm for a list).
Write to Your Government Reps
You may think that politicians look out for their constituents’ best interests,
but politicians often sacrifice what’s morally right for what appeals to the
masses. In order to tip the scales in favor of what’s morally right, you and
like-minded individuals need to raise your collective voice above the collec-
tive voice of the majority. You do that by writing letters and discussing issues
with your representatives.
Find out who represents you on the state and local levels and on the national
level. Get to know your representatives by name, and find out how to contact
them via e-mail or snail mail. Also, get involved in letter-writing campaigns,
such as those that your advocacy organization sponsors. Learn to use the
Web to track down the information you need:
 You can get on an e-mailing list at capwiz.com/ndmda/home or www.
nami.org to be notified of any legislation that’s up for a vote and how
action is proceeding on issues you care about.
 Go to www.senate.gov to find contact information for U.S. senators in
every state.
 You can find your state representative in the U.S. House of
Representatives, using your ZIP code, by going to www.house.gov.
This site also features a link you can click to write your representative
via the Web. The U.S. Capitol switchboard at 202-224-3121 can also help
you find your representatives and senators. Still on the goose chase?
Try to track them down at www.congress.org or Thomas.loc.gov.
 Don’t be afraid to go right to the top — write to the president himself at
president@whitehouse.gov.

Fight Stigma in the Workplace
Most people need jobs to eat and pay their bills. If you have a mental illness,
however, a job can mean much more. It can help structure your days, make
your life more meaningful, expand your social circles, and provide you with a
sense of independence. At your workplace, you may have several opportuni-
ties to fight stigma and improve conditions for yourself and anyone else who’s
struggling with a mental illness:
 If a coworker is diagnosed with a mental illness, help educate supervisors,
managers, and workers so they can become more accepting.
 Stick up for a coworker who has a mental illness.
 Try to influence hiring practices to encourage the employment of people
with mental illnesses. Your local chamber of commerce or department of
labor may be able to assist you.
 Speak out for parity of benefits when selecting health insurance plans.
 Encourage proper job placements or reasonable accommodations for
those who have a mental illness.
Protest Stigma in the Media
People like to joke about the most painful issues and poke fun at differences.
Mental illness makes people uncomfortable, so they commonly joke about it as
well, but sometimes the joking goes too far, and when the person poking fun
isn’t suffering from a particular disorder himself, the joke goes from a coping
mechanism to an insensitive attempt to demean others. In addition, it sends
people a hidden message that making fun of those “crazy people” is okay.
When you or loved ones have a mental illness, however, such jokes are jabs,
and you don’t need to just laugh it off. If you witness insensitivity in the
media, call the station or paper and complain, or write a letter. Many advo-
cacy organizations have their own corps of volunteers who keep an eye out
for stigma in the media. Consider joining.
Become Involved in Your Schools
Schools tend to herd students like cattle. If a kid doesn’t fit in, the stampede
tramples him. All kids have something very valuable to offer their schools
and communities, and each child should have the opportunity to achieve his
319
Chapter 21: Ten Ways to Help the Bipolar Community

potential and contribute in his unique way. Get involved in your school to
ensure that your child and other kids have the tools and resources they need
to succeed.
Consider joining your school’s PTA and seeing what you can do to have a
guest speaker do a presentation on mental illnesses, or try to schedule an
open-discussion forum on the topic. Find out what your school does to sup-
port children with bipolar disorder, ADHD, and other mental illnesses, and
find out what you and others in the community can do to help.
For more about supporting a child with bipolar disorder, refer to Chapter 18.
Work through Your Church
If you belong to a church or other religious organization, you may be able to
redirect a portion of its resources and people-power to improve mental health
services in your community. Almost all places of worship have meeting rooms
that are ideal for hosting support groups or mental health classes. If your
community has no support group, consider starting one yourself.
Another great way to help out through your place of worship is to create a
directory of members who are willing to have another member stay at their
homes in times of need.

Appendix
A Glossary of Bipolar-Related
Terms
acute: The stage of a manic or depressive episode that comes on rapidly,
lasts a relatively short time, and is severe.
adjunctive: Complementary to the main treatment.
affective disorder: A category of psychiatric disorders that includes depres-
sion, bipolar disorder, and seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Affect is a med-
ical term for “mood.”
anticonvulsant: A class of medications developed primarily to prevent
epileptic seizures. Many anticonvulsants, including valproate and carba-
mazepine, are also useful in treating mania.
antidepressant: A class of medications that have proved effective in treating
the symptoms of depression.
antipsychotic: A class of medications developed to reduce the frequency and
severity of psychotic episodes, which sometimes occur during mania or
depression. Antipsychotics have also proved useful in treating mania and the
psychoses that sometimes accompany depression and mania.
bipolar disorder: A psychiatric condition characterized by extreme mood
states of mania and depression. A person may have bipolar disorder even if
he has experienced only one of the extreme mood states, making diagnosis
very challenging.
Bipolar I: A type of bipolar disorder characterized by at least one full-blown
manic episode that doctors can’t attribute to another cause, such as a med-
ication or substance abuse. A Bipolar I diagnosis doesn’t require an episode
of major depression.
Bipolar II: A type of bipolar disorder characterized by at least one major
depressive episode that doctors can’t attribute to another cause, along with
experiencing one or more hypomanic episodes. People with Bipolar II are

often misdiagnosed with chronic depression and prescribed antidepressants,
which may induce mania.
Bipolar NOS: A type of bipolar disorder characterized by hypomanic, manic,
or depressive episodes that don’t fit in any of the other bipolar categories
and can’t be ascribed to unipolar depression.
bipolar spectrum: A continuous range of mood disorders that extends from
highly reactive moods and mood regulation problems to more classical bipo-
lar disorder. The term is used as an umbrella concept to cover all types of
bipolar disorders.
board certified: The status of a physician that indicates she has passed a
standardized exam that qualifies her to specialize in a particular field of 
medicine.
circadian rhythm: An individual’s biological pattern of sleep, wakefulness,
and energy that plays out through the course of a day. Some studies show
that irregularities in a person’s circadian rhythm can destabilize moods.
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): A therapy that attempts to identify neg-
ative thoughts and thought processes and their resulting behaviors and
retrain individuals to think and act more positively. Several studies show that
CBT is highly effective for treating some forms of depression.
comorbid: Any medical condition that presents along with and often indepen-
dent from another condition. People who have bipolar disorder can have other
comorbid conditions — such as ADHD, alcoholism, or anxiety disorder — that
complicate the diagnosis and treatment of the bipolar disorder.
cyclothymia: Sometimes referred to as “bipolar lite,” cyclothymia is a muted
form of bipolar disorder that nevertheless interferes with your life. It involves
multiple episodes of hypomania and depressive symptoms, which don’t meet
the criteria for mania or major depression. Symptoms must last for at least
two years, during which you have no more than two months without symp-
toms.
differential diagnosis: The process of distinguishing between two or more
diseases or conditions that feature identical or similar symptoms. A doctor
commonly performs a differential diagnosis to rule out other possibilities.
dopamine: Generally considered the feel-good neurotransmitter, dopamine
is linked to feelings of pleasure. It modulates attention and focus as well as
muscle movements and is also related to psychosis.
DSM-IV: Short for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, ver-
sion 4, this is the bible of psychiatry that describes various syndromes and
conditions and the symptoms that must be present to establish a particular
diagnosis.
322
Bipolar Disorder For Dummies 

dysphoria: An unpleasant, irritable mood. The opposite of euphoria.
dysthymia: Chronic, low-level depression, commonly characterized by irri-
tability and an inability to feel pleasure or joy.
electroconvulsive therapy (ECT): A medical procedure in which a low-level
electrical current is applied to the brain to induce a mild seizure in order to
treat depression. ECT is often successful in treating depression that doesn’t
respond to medicine or therapy or in cases in which patients prefer it to any of
the other treatment choices. ECT can also be an effective treatment for mania.
essential fatty acid (EFA): A healthy fat, which your body uses for tissue
development and other purposes, that you must obtain through diet. Omega-3
is a source of several EFAs that may be valuable in treating many health prob-
lems, including mood disorders.
euphoria: A feeling of elation, which is great unless it becomes exaggerated,
as it sometimes does with the onset of hypomania or mania.
euthymic: Moods considered to be in the normal range — not manic or
depressive.
executive function: The ability to organize, sort, and manage incoming infor-
mation and make decisions. Many psychiatric disorders weaken executive
functioning, often leading to impaired judgment and uninhibited behavior.
expressed emotion: Highly charged attitudes that people express in words or
gestures, that are part of a family pattern, and that affect the person who has
the mood disorder. All expressed emotion can be dangerous for a person
with bipolar disorder, but the most damaging consists of criticism, hostility,
and emotional overinvolvement.
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA): An amino acid neurotransmitter that can
either cool down or excite brain cells, depending on other chemicals surround-
ing it.
glutamate: A neurotransmitter that’s involved in revving up the central ner-
vous system. Glutamate may play a significant role in causing mania.
G-protein: Short for guanine nucleotide binding protein, a protein found in
neurons that’s part of the “second-messenger” system that regulates signal
transmissions in the brain. The study of genetic variations in this protein may
eventually play a role in diagnosing bipolar disorder.
hypersexual: Having an excessive interest or involvement in sexual activity.
hyperthymic: A medical term for “high energy” — very outgoing and active,
often highly confident, temperamental, and sometimes arrogant or narcissistic.
323
Appendix: A Glossary of Bipolar-Related Terms

hyperthyroidism: A malfunction of the thyroid gland that results in the over-
production of hormones; the symptoms can mimic those of mania.
hypomania: An elevated mood that doesn’t qualify as full-blown mania but
that typically involves increased energy, less need for sleep, clarity of vision,
and a strong creative drive. These changes are noticeable to others but don’t
significantly impair daily function.
hypothyroidism: A malfunction of the thyroid gland that results in the under-
production of hormones; the symptoms can mimic depression.
Individual Education Plan (IEP): A personalized program for teaching a child
or adolescent with developmental, medical, or psychiatric conditions that
affect school and learning.
insight: A clear acceptance and understanding of a psychological disorder
and the ability to objectively observe one’s own behaviors and attitudes that
are characteristic of the disorder.
interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (IPSRT): A therapy developed specif-
ically to maintain mood stability through strict scheduling, learning about per-
sonal roles, coping with transitions, developing healthy routines, increasing
social contact, and resolving and preventing interpersonal problems.
kindling: The gradual increase in susceptibility to mood episodes with each
successive occurrence of a mood episode. The kindling model is based on a
process that occurs in the brains of people with seizures; some experts
believe that the same model applies to bipolar disorder.
maintenance dose: An amount of a prescription medication that’s intended
to prevent the onset of symptoms rather than treat existing symptoms.
major depressive episode: An extreme low mood lasting at least two weeks
and characterized by symptoms such as despair, fatigue, loss or increase in
appetite, loss of interest in pleasurable activities, sleeping too much or the
inability to sleep, and thoughts of death or suicide.
mania: An extremely elevated mood typically characterized by euphoria,
excessive energy, impulsivity, nervousness, impaired judgment, irritability,
and a decreased need for sleep.
manic depression: Another name for bipolar disorder.
manic episode: A period of elevated mood, either euphoric or irritable, typi-
cally characterized by impulsivity, nervousness, impaired judgment, irritabil-
ity, and a decreased need for sleep. The period must last at least one week.
MAO inhibitor: A class of antidepressant medications that slow the action of
monoamine oxidase, an enzyme responsible for breaking down dopamine,
324
Bipolar Disorder For Dummies 

serotonin, and norepinephrine in the brain. Doctors often prescribe MAO
inhibitors only if a person reacts poorly to other antidepressants because of
the strict diet changes needed when taking MAO inhibitors.
mechanism of action: The way a medication acts on the biology or physiol-
ogy of the brain to produce the desired effect.
mixed state: A mood episode in which depression and mania are both pre-
sent, typically resulting in excited irritability.
mood chart: A graph that shows the rise and fall of mood levels over time.
Mood charts are very useful in predicting the onset of mood episodes and
documenting the response to medications.
mood disorder: A psychiatric condition that results in persistently disrupted
moods and/or mood regulation.
mood stabilizer: Strictly speaking, a medication that prevents depression
and mania. The term typically describes any medications that have anti-
manic effects, even if they don’t treat depression.
neuroleptic: Another name for antipsychotics, neuroleptics led the charge in
pharmacological treatment of mental illness in the 1950s and 1960s.
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome: A potentially fatal but very rare side effect
of antipsychotic medications that results in high temperature, muscle rigid-
ity, and altered consciousness.
neurotransmitter: A chemical in the brain that carries messages between
brain cells.
norepinephrine: Best known for its role in your fight-or-flight response, nor-
epinephrine is a neurotransmitter that functions to regulate mood, anxiety,
and memory.
off label: A legal use of a prescription medication to treat symptoms that the
FDA (Food and Drug Administration) didn’t officially approve it to treat.

maintenance dose of a medication to prevent the onset of symptoms.
protein kinases: A group of second messengers that trigger changes to pro-
teins inside the neuron.
psychiatrist: A physician who specializes in the biology and physiology of the
brain. A psychiatrist’s primary role in treating bipolar disorder is to diagnose
and prescribe medication, but psychiatrists also provide patient education
and psychotherapy.
psychoeducation: A type of therapy that consists primarily of educating the
afflicted person about the condition, its causes, and its treatment so he can
more effectively manage the condition.
psychologist: A professional who specializes in thought processes and
behaviors. A psychologist can play a critical role in stabilizing moods by
helping the sufferer adjust negative thoughts and thought processes and con-
trol self-destructive behaviors.

affects mental functioning, emotions, or behavior.
rapid cycling: A state in which mood alternates between depression and
mania more than four times in a year.
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS): The application of
strong, quick-changing magnetic fields to the brain to produce electrical
fields indirectly. Some consider this less stressful than electroconvulsive
therapy.
schizoaffective disorder: A psychiatric disorder in which symptoms of bipo-
lar disorder and schizophrenia are both present.
326
Bipolar Disorder For Dummies 

schizophrenia: A psychiatric disorder in which thought becomes dissociated
from sensory input and emotions and is accompanied by hallucinations and
delusional thinking. Bipolar disorder may be misdiagnosed as schizophrenia,
especially in men.
seasonal affective disorder (SAD): A mood disorder that’s strongly linked to
the change of seasons. People who have SAD commonly experience major
depressive episodes in the winter months.
second messenger: A chemical that carries signals within a brain cell rather
than between brain cells.
seizure: A sudden, involuntary muscle contraction caused by a brain 
malfunction.
Selective Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor (SSNRI): A
class of antidepressant medications that prevent the brain from absorbing
and breaking down the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin after
their use, thus increasing the concentration of both chemicals in the brain.
Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI): A class of antidepressant
medications that prevent the brain from absorbing and breaking down the
neurotransmitter serotonin after its use, thus increasing the concentration
of serotonin.
self-medicate: The attempt to stabilize your moods by taking nonprescription
chemical substances, including alcohol and marijuana, or by regulating your
doses of prescription medication without a doctor’s assistance.
serotonin: A neurotransmitter that helps regulate mood, anxiety, fear, sleep,
body temperature, the rate at which your body releases certain hormones,
and many other body and brain processes.
stigmatize: To brand someone as disgraceful or shameful.

Appendix: A Glossary of Bipolar-Related Terms

therapeutic level: The concentration of medicine in the bloodstream required
for the medication to be effective.
thyroid: A gland situated below the Adam’s apple that produces hormones
that control growth and influence moods.
total sleep deprivation (TSD): A controversial therapy for depression that
consists of subjecting a patient to 36 hours without sleep followed by a 12-
hour recovery sleep. Some studies show that TSD alleviates depression, but
it poses a risk of inducing mania.
tricyclic antidepressant: A class of medications developed to treat depres-
sion by limiting the reuptake of the neurotransmitters serotonin and 
norepinephrine.
unipolar depression: A mood disorder characterized by episodes of major
depression without symptoms of mania or hypomania.
